<h1>Q: What is the best way to mow the lawn?</h1> <br>
 Answer(s) to this 
Question&nbsp;&nbsp;( 1 / 14 <br>
) <br>
<br>
<br>

<h3>Mowing St. Augustine</h3>St. Augustine prefers mowing to 3 inches in full 
sun, 3-1/2 to 4 inches in shade. When you mow St. Augustine, your goal is to 
have the target height after having removed only 1/3rd of the grass with each 
mowing. So if your St. Augustine is in full sun, you should wait until it 
reaches 4-1/2 inches and remove 1-1/2 inches. If it's growing in shade, wait 
until the grass reaches about 5-1/2 inches, and remove about 1-3/4 to 2 inches. 
Keep your mower blade razor sharp!<br>
<br>

<h3>Mowing Centipede</h3>Centipede prefers mowing to about 2 inches in full 
sun, 3 inches in part shade. Centipede forms a poor turf in full shade and 
should not be planted there. When you mow Centipede, your goal is to have the 
target height after having removed only 1/3rd of the grass with each mowing. So 
if your Centipede is in full sun, you should wait until it reaches 3 inches and 
remove 1 inch. If it's growing in part shade, wait until the grass reaches 
about 4-1/2 inches, and remove about 1-1/2 inches. Keep your mower blade razor 
sharp! 
<h3>Mowing Common Bermuda</h3>Common Bermuda prefers mowing to 1 to 1-1/4 
inches in full sun. Bermuda forms a very poor turf in any shade and should not 
be planted there. When you mow Common Bermuda, your goal is to have the target 
height after having removed only 1/3rd of the grass with each mowing. So if 
your Bermuda is in full sun, you should wait until it reaches 2-1/4 inches and 
remove about 3/4 inch. Keep your mower blade razor sharp! 
<h3>Mowing Zoysia</h3>Zoysia prefers mowing to 1 to 1-1/4 inches in full sun 
and between 1-1/2 to 1-3/4 in part sun to part shade. When you mow Zoysia, your 
goal is to have the target height after having removed only 1/3rd of the grass 
with each mowing. So if your Zoysia is in full sun, you should wait until it 
reaches 1-3/4 inches and remove just over 1/2 inch. If it's growing in shade, 
wait until the grass reaches about 2-1/2 inches and remove just over 3/4 inch. 
Keep your mower blade razor sharp! 
<h3>Mowing Tall Fescue</h3>Tall Fescue prefers mowing to 3 inches in full sun, 
3-1/2 to 4 inches in shade. When you mow Tall Fescue, your goal is to have the 
target height after having removed only 1/3rd of the grass with each mowing. So 
if your Tall Fescue lawn is in full sun, you should wait until it reaches 4-1/2 
inches and remove 1-1/2 inches. If it's growing in shade, wait until the grass 
reaches about 5-1/2 inches, and remove about 1-3/4 to 2 inches. Keep your mower 
blade razor sharp! 
<h3>Mowing Hybrid Bermuda</h3>Mowing the hybrid Bermuda varieties requires 
specific knowledge about the growth and mowing requirements of the variety or 
varieties you have in your lawn. If you are unsure about the type of Bermuda 
you have, ASK SOMEONE! You should have the variety identified by a qualified 
turfcare professional or your Cooperative Extension Service. Mowing these 
grasses also requires the use of specialized equipment. Ordinary rotary mowers 
are ill-suited to mowing most hybrid Bermuda varieties. Pardon the pun, but a 
$140 red ranger from the discount garden center won't cut it. You will ruin the 
turf in one season. To properly maintain your hybrid Bermuda, you'll need a 
reel mower. A power reel mower can be bought from lawn and garden equipment 
dealers who cater to turf managers and groundskeepers. A reel mower like the 
one your grandfather used to mow his grass with can be had for the same price 
as the red ranger, but you'll have to look around. If you don't have the money 
for the power equipment and you don't have the energy to mow your hybrid 
Bermuda with a old-fashioned reel mower, you'll either have to hire someone to 
mow your lawn, or replace the grass with something you can mow yourself. 
<h3>Alternate your pattern</h3>Lawns that are mowed frequently can develop 
ruts from mower wheels, especially if you have a large, heavy tractor or rider. 
When you mow, alternate your pattern. Mow once traveling horizontally across 
the lawn. The next time, travel vertically. If you really want to get fancy and 
impress the neighbors, travel diagonally on the third mowing and diagonally 
from the opposite corner the fourth time. 
<h3>Cool and dry</h3>Mow when it's cool and dry. After the morning dew dries 
off is the best time for the grass--it isn't suffering afternoon heat stress 
but it isn't so damp that grass clumps form. Late afternoon or early evening 
following a morning watering is just as good. 
<h3>Mow at full throttle</h3>Your mower's engine drives the blade with the 
right amount of energy when it is used at full throttle. You do not save gas by 
slowing the engine down. In fact, the bogging and slowing down this causes 
probably uses more gas than if you ran the engine efficiently. 
<h3>Leave the clippings</h3>Leaving your grass clippings on the lawn is 
actually a good thing. As the grass clippings decompose they add valuable 
nitrogen to the soil - almost 2 pounds per 1000 square feet each season. As 
well they add organic matter and other benefits to the soil that will actually 
make your lawn healthier.<i>Make sure you mow frequently, and remove no more 
than 1/3rd of the leaf blade with each mowing. LUCKIE</i> 
<h3>grass clippings and thatch</h3>There is a wide spread belief that leaving 
the grass clippings on your lawn contributes to thatch - dead or dying grass 
parts that prevent moisture and oxygen from reaching plant roots. But the truth 
is that the just opposite is true. Fresh clippings stimulate earthworm activity 
which breaks down the thatch. 
<h3>Wear your safety gear</h3>You don't look stupid when you wear safety 
glasses and sturdy, non-slip shoes. You look like a professional, and a smart 
one at that. 
<h3>The Rumble </h3>Most properly designed mulching mowers make a rumbling 
sound as they move over new grass. This is completely normal and is no cause 
for alarm. By all means, inspect your equipment if you hear something 
funny--but if you recently purchased a mulching mower and the only thing you've 
heard that worries you is the rumble, relax with the knowledge that the 
equipment is working exactly as it was designed. 
<h3>Mow at the right pace</h3>I know the ball game starts in 30 minutes, but 
you can't run through the yard with the lawn mower. Take your time and do it 
right--let the mower do the job you bought it to do. Not only is rushing it 
going to give you an ugly cut, you could seriously injure yourself. <br>
