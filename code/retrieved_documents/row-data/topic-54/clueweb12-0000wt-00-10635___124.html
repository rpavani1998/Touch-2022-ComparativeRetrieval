<dd> <i>Walt Disney World is a huge city with several district articles 
containing sightseeing, restaurant, nightlife and accommodation listings 
&mdash; consider printing them all.</i> <br>
Magic Kingdom parade </dd> </dl> 
<p>At the <b>Walt Disney World Resort</b> [1], you can explore human 
innovation and cooperation; enjoy rides both thrilling and enchanting; relax 
and recuperate on the beach or the golf course; and discover an entire resort 
where children and adults can have fun&mdash;together.</p> 
<p>Walt Disney World, located in Lake Buena Vista, Florida, near Orlando, is 
the flagship of Disney's worldwide theme park empire. It is, by far, the most 
popular theme park resort in the world. Some visitors describe it as a place of 
magic, wonder, and fantasy; others speak of fun, excitement, and relaxation; 
and still others complain of crowds, artifice, and unrelenting tackiness. As 
with most things, the essence of Walt Disney World lies near the intersection 
of those three views.</p> 
<p>The centerpieces of Walt Disney World are the four theme parks: The <b>
Magic Kingdom</b>, <b>Epcot</b>, <b>Disney's Hollywood Studios</b>, and <b>
Disney's Animal Kingdom</b>. Walt Disney World also has the world's two most 
popular water parks,<b>Typhoon Lagoon</b> and <b>Blizzard Beach</b>, both 
heavily themed. Two shopping and entertainment districts,<b>Downtown Disney</b> 
and<b>Disney's Boardwalk</b>, provide extensive shopping, dining, and 
entertainment options. If none of that strikes your fancy, check out some of 
the lesser-known activities: golf, tennis, boating, race car driving, spas and 
health clubs, backstage tours, sporting events, character dining, and much more.
</p> 
<p>Simply put, if you can't find <i>something</i> fun to do at Walt Disney 
World, you just aren't trying hard enough.</p> 
<h2>[edit] Districts</h2> 
<p>Walt Disney World can be divided into five distinct areas&mdash;one for 
each of the four theme parks, plus Downtown Disney. The various resort hotels, 
and the attractions and restaurants found within, are grouped with the nearest 
park.</p> 
<ul> 
<li>The <b>Magic Kingdom</b> &mdash; Based on the original Disneyland in 
California, this is the oldest and most popular park of the complex; in fact, 
with over 17 million visitors annually, it's the most-visited single theme park 
in the world. This is the park people think of first when they think of Walt 
Disney World, a place where adventure meets fantasy and history meets the 
future. The Magic Kingdom has the most kid-friendly attractions and most of the 
classic rides beloved by kids-at-heart.</li> 
<li><b>Epcot</b> &mdash; A sort of &quot;permanent World's Fair&quot;, Epcot 
is dedicated to both international culture and technological innovation. World 
Showcase takes you on a trip around the world as you visit themed pavilions 
filled with the art, architecture, people, and products of eleven different 
countries. Future World explores human achievements in pavilions dedicated to 
communication, imagination, conservation, and more. Not far from Epcot is<b>
Disney's Boardwalk</b>, a collection of restaurants, gift shops, and nightlife 
spots themed as a 1920's Eastern Seaboard boardwalk.</li> 
<li><b>Disney's Hollywood Studios</b> &mdash; This park represents the 
&quot;Hollywood that never was,&quot; with attractions themed around movies and 
television. You'll find a variety of live shows and attractions based on 
Disney, Pixar, and Lucasfilm productions. The<b>ESPN Wide World of Sports</b> 
complex is nearby.</li> 
<li><b>Disney's Animal Kingdom</b> &mdash; Something of a mix between a zoo 
and a theme park, Animal Kingdom features naturalistic live animal exhibits 
alongside more traditional Disney amusement rides.<b>Blizzard Beach</b>, a 
water park themed as a melting ski resort, is nearby.</li> 
<li><b>Downtown Disney</b> &mdash; For more &quot;grown-up&quot; activities, 
Downtown Disney has shopping, nightclubs, restaurants, and unique 
entertainment. This is where the most action is after dark. Downtown Disney is 
divided into three sections. Downtown Disney Marketplace has several shopping 
and eating establishments and is tailored towards a family setting. Pleasure 
Island is a more adult oriented section, with upscale restaurants and even a 
cigar bar. Finally, Downtown Disney West Side is home to AMC Theatres, House of 
Blues, and the exclusive Cirque du Soleil show<i>La Nouba</i>. <b>Typhoon Lagoon
</b> water park is nearby. </li> </ul> 
<h2>[edit] Understand</h2> 
<p><b>We're all in this together</b> </p>
<p>Perhaps not surprisingly, the eight most visited theme parks in the world 
are all affiliated with Walt Disney Parks and Resorts, and Walt Disney World's 
four theme parks all appear in that top eight.</p>  Rank  Park  Attendance

<dd> <i>&quot;I do not make films primarily for children. I make them for the 
child in all of us, whether we be six or sixty. Call the child 'innocence'. The 
worst of us is not without innocence, although buried deeply it might be. In my 
work I try to reach and speak to that innocence, showing it the fun and joy of 
living; showing it that laughter is healthy; showing it that the human species, 
although happily ridiculous at times, is still reaching for the stars.&quot;</i>
 &mdash; Walt Disney </dd> </dl> 
<p>The most important thing to understand about the Walt Disney World Resort 
is that it was designed to be<b>fun for <i>every</i>one</b>. Don't make the 
mistake of staying away just because you don't have kids. Singles and couples 
without children who think a Walt Disney World vacation is just for kids ignore 
the many &quot;adult&quot; entertainments available throughout the resort. 
Gourmands, sun-worshippers, world travelers, thrill-seekers, comedy-lovers, 
film devotees, sports fans, club-hoppers, and history buffs will all find 
plenty of ways to have a great time.</p> 
<p>Of course, if you do have kids, the best part of your Walt Disney World 
vacation is in experiencing the parks through their eyes.<i>That</i> is when 
you really understand Walt Disney's vision of a place where<b>kids and parents 
can have fun together</b>. </p> 
<p>Walt Disney World is enormous, a <b>multi-day resort destination</b>. Each 
of its four theme parks is big enough to occupy visitors for a full day (and 
often two, depending on crowds). Unless you live nearby, four days is 
considered the<i>bare minimum</i> length of visit to even begin to experience 
the resort; some people stay as long as two weeks and still bypass some 
attractions.</p> 
<p>Traveling to Walt Disney World represents a major pilgrimage for many 
American families. The &quot;typical&quot; visit involves flying into Orlando 
International Airport, busing to an on-site Disney hotel, spending about a week 
without leaving Disney property, and returning home. There are infinite 
variations possible, but this remains what most people mean when they talk of 
&quot;going to Disney World&quot;.</p> 
<p>Everything at Walt Disney World is <b>carefully constructed and 
choreographed</b> to maintain your perceptions of visiting an idealized world. 
Company jargon frames every aspect of customer service as part of the 
&quot;show&quot;: employees are &quot;<b>cast members</b>&quot;, visitors are 
&quot;<b>guests</b>&quot;, and every prop and costume must be completely 
&quot;in-character&quot; while &quot;on-stage&quot; (visible to guests).</p> 
<p>Disney prides themselves on customer service and friendliness. You will 
never find garbage lying in the streets or bathrooms that are too dirty, and 
anything that is damaged is either removed or fixed immediately. The streets 
are almost sparkling and the buildings look brand new no matter what time of 
the day or year you are there.</p> 
<p>While some people find this attention to detail cloying and artificial, the 
vast majority of visitors are happy to immerse themselves in this relaxing, 
carefree environment. Even so, the realities of Walt Disney World can be stark: 
long lines, sweltering heat, rude guests, and expensive merchandise are common. 
There are ways to avoid the worst elements (namely by carefully choosing when 
to visit) and customer service is almost universally impeccable, even (or 
perhaps especially) when things go wrong.</p> 
<p>Many first-time visitors try to do too much during their stay. Unless 
crowds are unusually small, this is a sure-fire recipe for burnout and 
exhaustion. You need to have a basic schedule in mind, but you should remain 
flexible in order to account for closed rides, full restaurants, special 
events, and just changing your mind. If the crowds get too heavy or the weather 
gets too hot, smart guests staying on-site head back to their hotels to relax, 
grab a snack, or take a swim, then return later in the day. Trying to adhere to 
a rigid schedule will only frustrate you and your family, and you're not going 
to Walt Disney World to get frustrated, are you?</p> 
<p>With some careful basic planning, an open mind, and a cheerful attitude, a 
visit to Walt Disney World can be whatever you want it to be: fulfilling, 
exciting, relaxing, enlightening, or just plain<i>fun</i>. Whatever you chose 
to do, your visit is guaranteed to be an<i>experience</i>, in every sense of 
the word&mdash;one you'll never forget.</p> 
<h3>[edit] History</h3> 
<p>Disneyland was an unmitigated success. <b>Walt Disney</b> had created not 
just an amusement park, where children could ride kiddie rides while their 
parents watched from a bench, but the world's first<b>theme park</b>, a place 
where children and grown-ups could<i>both</i> have fun, together. </p> 
<p>But it was not long after Disneyland's 1955 opening that Walt realized that 
the available space inAnaheim was too small. He had his park, but he and his <b>
Imagineers</b> were constantly coming up with new ideas, ideas that just 
weren't going to fit inside Disneyland. In the sixties, Walt began looking to 
the east coast, for a place with enough space to hold all of the ideas his team 
could dream up. He found such a place inCentral Florida, southwest of the 
sleepy city of<b>Orlando</b>. Here, along the new <b>Interstate 4</b>, there 
was plenty of space, far more than would be needed for just a single theme 
park. Walt had grander ideas in mind for this &quot;Florida Project&quot; of 
his.</p> 
<p>After buying up over 27,000 acres (11,000&nbsp;ha) of land on the sly, Walt 
announced his ambitious<b>Disney World</b> plans to the world. A theme park 
would be built, of course&mdash;a<b>Magic Kingdom</b> on the north end of the 
property. But to get there from I-4, guests would need to pass through the true 
centerpiece of the project:<b>EPCOT</b>, the <b>Experimental Prototype 
Community of Tomorrow</b>. </p> 
<p>EPCOT was Walt Disney's largest, most revolutionary idea yet&mdash;a real 
city, with 20,000 real people living and working within, making use of the most 
advanced technologies to grow food, provide transport, and enhance quality of 
life. Much of the technology was already in use at 
Disneyland&mdash;PeopleMovers and monorails, for instance&mdash;but these would 
not be amusement rides. EPCOT was to be a place where the Imagineers' ideas 
were put to practical use, for the betterment of all mankind.</p> 
<p>Alas, it was not to be. Walt died in December 1966, just as the Florida 
Project was coming to fruition. Without Walt to drive the project, the company 
board refused to undertake the ambitious EPCOT plans. But Walt's brother<b>Roy 
O. Disney</b> insisted the project as a whole go forward, starting with the 
Magic Kingdom. Roy changed the project's name to<b> <i>Walt</i> Disney World</b>
; this new resort would be a tribute to Walt's vision, but would never really 
be the fulfillment of it.</p> 
<p>The Magic Kingdom opened on October 1, 1971, with two hotels, a campground, 
and twogolf courses nearby. It was an immediate success, single-handedly 
sparking the development of the Orlando area as one of the country's busiest 
vacation destinations. Though Roy died before the year ended, he had succeeded 
in getting his brother's final project off the ground.</p> 
<p>Walt Disney World's first decade passed quickly, and by the time of its 
&quot;Tencennial&quot; celebration in 1981, a new theme park was being built in 
the space Walt had envisioned for EPCOT. The new park would be called<b>EPCOT 
Center</b>, though it bore little resemblance to Walt's original plans. 
Instead, EPCOT Center would be a sort of &quot;permanent world's fair&quot;, 
combining<b>Future World</b>, made up of grand pavilions devoted to human 
progress, with a<b>World Showcase</b> of meticulously detailed recreations of 
foreign lands. EPCOT Center opened in 1982, and was followed by a combination 
theme park and movie studio called<b>Disney-MGM Studios</b> in 1989, and then by
<b>Disney's Animal Kingdom</b>, a zoological theme park, in 1998. </p> 
<p>Over the years, numerous resort hotels and recreational activities were 
added to support the increased attendance at the multi-park resort. Two large 
water parks were added in 1989 and in 1995. In addition, a remote area of the 
property that started as Lake Buena Vista Shopping Village evolved into the 
Disney Village Marketplace, and eventually expanded to become<b>Downtown Disney
</b>, an adult-oriented shopping and entertainment district. </p> 
<p>Walt Disney never would have imagined what Walt Disney World has become, 
and it is far removed from his original vision. But one of his guiding 
principles was to &quot;keep moving forward&quot;, and Disney World has done 
just that, becoming the largest and most popular theme park resort complex in 
the world.</p> 
<h3>[edit] Read</h3> 
<p>Enough books have been written about Walt Disney World to fill a good-sized 
bookshelf. One very informative set of books are the<b>Imagineering Field Guides
</b>; there's one for each of the four parks (plus one for Disneyland). They go 
through each park area-by-area and feature great concept images (some rarely 
seen), behind-the-scenes details, and tricks of the Imagineering trade. They're 
also small enough to carry in your pocket as you tour the parks.</p> 
<p>Surprisingly, not much fiction has been written about the parks themselves. 
Ridley Pearson has an ongoing series of young-adult novels set inside the 
parks, called<i><b>The Kingdom Keepers</b></i>. There's also <i><b>Down and Out 
in the Magic Kingdom</b></i>, a science-fiction novel by Cory Doctorow that 
takes place primarily in a future version of the Magic Kingdom.</p> 
<h3>[edit] Watch</h3> 
<p>The Walt Disney Company is a multinational media conglomerate, so video 
productions featuring Walt Disney World are ubiquitous.</p> 
<p>Several television programs have filmed on-location at the resort. The 
1990s-era revival of<i><b>The Mickey Mouse Club</b></i> (the one that gave 
Britney Spears and Justin Timberlake their starts) was filmed entirely at the 
production facilities inside Disney-MGM Studios (now Hollywood Studios).<i>Full 
House</i>, <i>Roseanne</i>, <i>Family Matters</i>, and <i>Sabrina the Teenage 
Witch</i> are among the <b>sitcoms</b> (mostly on Disney-owned ABC) with 
episodes showing the characters visiting Walt Disney World. Another fun option, 
if you can find it, is 1990's<i><b>The Muppets at Walt Disney World</b></i>, 
which was intended as a precursor to Disney's purchase of the<b>Muppets</b> 
(which finally happened in 2004).</p> 
<p>Those shows only used the park as a backdrop, though, so they have limited 
&quot;tourist&quot; value. For meatier fare, there's always the yearly<i><b>
Walt Disney World Christmas Day Parade</b></i>, which often includes segments 
showing the latest and greatest attractions around the World. If you're going 
to watch the parade just to get planning information, though, you might as well 
just call Disney at<i>+1</i> 407 W-DISNEY and ask for their <b>free vacation 
planning video</b> [3]. As expected, you won't find much official material that 
addresses the problems you might encounter at Walt Disney World, but they do 
offer a good introduction to the resort for first-timers who are trying to get 
a feel for the place before they go. Another good source of information is the
<b>official YouTube channel</b> of Walt Disney Parks and Resorts [4]. </p> 
<p>Disney has also made a few full-length features based on various rides in 
the parks&mdash;the four<i><b>Pirates of the Caribbean</b></i> films being by 
far the best&mdash;but don't expect the rides to have much of anything to do 
with the films. Okay, yes, Jack Sparrow can now be spotted inside the<i>Pirates
</i> ride, but it's just a cameo appearance. </p> 
<p>Last but not least, Walt Disney World is featured in three &quot;<b>Disney 
Sing Along Songs</b>&quot; titles. <i>Campout at Walt Disney World</i> is set 
at Fort Wilderness Campground,<i>Beach Party at Walt Disney World</i> covers a 
wide range of activities including the two water parks, and<i>Flik's Musical 
Adventure</i> is set at Disney's Animal Kingdom. </p> 
<h3>[edit] Climate</h3> 
<p> </p> 
<p><b>Check the weather forecast for Lake Buena Vista, FL from NOAA.</b> </p> 
<br> <br>

<p> Like all of Central Florida, the climate at Walt Disney World is <b>humid 
and subtropical</b>. Summer (May&ndash;October) is hot and sticky and winter 
(November&ndash;April) is mild and drier. Visitors from higher latitudes are 
often surprised by the sheer<b>intensity of the summer sun</b> in Florida, 
which can rise to within a few degrees of straight overhead in June and July. 
In June through September,<b>late afternoon thundershowers</b> are very common; 
plan accordingly.</p> 
<p>That said, climate problems are well known at Walt Disney World and there 
are several means to cope (see&quot;Weather&quot; in the Stay Safe section). 
</p> 
<p>Inclement weather can often lead to the temporary closure of outdoor rides 
and live performances. In the case of rides, they will re-open after the 
weather improves, and FastPass tickets will continue to be accepted, even if 
the printed time interval has expired. Live performances may be either delayed 
or canceled outright. On the other hand, inclement weather could work to your 
advantage, as it drives some visitors away from outdoor areas, or out of the 
parks entirely.</p> 
<h3>[edit] When to visit</h3> 
<p>There used to be some times of year when the parks were relatively 
deserted, but not so much anymore. Now they just vary<b>from &quot;moderately 
busy&quot; to &quot;completely insane&quot;</b>. Still, deciding when to go 
remains a<b>game of trade-offs</b>: you must decide whether to favor lower 
crowds or longer park hours, and decide whether you prefer scorching days or 
chilly nights.</p> 
<p>The peak periods for attendance are late December, mid-June to mid-August, 
and mid-February to mid-April. Why? That's when kids are<b>on break from school
</b>. If you have kids, you may have no choice but to go during these peak 
times. The bad news is that you'll be packed like sardines next to 50,000 of 
your new closest friends, you'll wait two hours to go on rides like Splash 
Mountain and Soarin', and you'll be paying a premium for the privilege. In the 
summer, you also get to listen to the kids complain about the heat. On the 
bright side, though, you'll have plenty of company, the parks are guaranteed to 
be open late, and as many rides as possible will be up and running.</p> 
<p>If your schedule allows any flexibility at all, you should avoid these peak 
periods. Attendance is lowest in October, November (pre-Thanksgiving), December 
(pre-Christmas), and January. These can be very good times to go; crowds are 
low and prices are too, but keep in mind that you may find that several rides 
are shut down for maintenance, and the parks have shorter operating hours. In 
the winter, it's often too cold to go to the water parks, and you'll need a 
jacket at night.</p> 
<p>The weeks between Easter and Memorial Day are another slow period, as well 
as the months of August and September; both periods provide a good balance of 
price, crowds, temperature, and operating hours, but you may need to take the 
kids out of school if you're bringing them along.</p> 
<p>Of course, you may want to coordinate your trip with a <b>special event</b>
. (It's no coincidence that these events are scheduled during otherwise-slow 
periods for the parks.)Epcot has two months-long events: the <b>Epcot 
International Flower &amp; Garden Festival</b> runs from March to mid-May, and 
the<b>Epcot International Food &amp; Wine Festival</b> runs from October 
through mid-November.Hollywood Studios is the location for <b>Star Wars Weekends
</b> in May and June. </p> 
<p>The Magic Kingdom hosts two special hard-ticket holiday events, <b>Mickey's 
Not-So-Scary Halloween Party</b> in September and October, and <b>Mickey's Very 
Merry Christmas Party</b> in November and December. These events, which let you 
stay in the park past the normal closing time, cost more than $50 per person, 
but tickets are limited so the crowds stay small.</p> <br>
How do they get the 
star on top? 
<p>Speaking of <b>Christmas</b>, the month of December may just be the most 
magical time of year at Walt Disney World. The entire resort goes all-out to 
decorate<i>everything</i>, with huge themed Christmas trees in each of the 
parks and each of the resorts, and the spectacular<b>Castle Dreamlights</b> 
draped onto Cinderella Castle. There are also countless holiday events at the 
resorts, the<b>Osborne Family Spectacle of Dancing Lights</b> at Hollywood 
Studios, the<b>Candlelight Processional</b> at Epcot, and much much more. And 
as long as you avoid Thanksgiving week and Christmas week, the crowds really 
aren't that bad.</p> 
<h4>[edit] Timing</h4> 
<p>If your vacation dates are flexible, plan to arrive to the Orlando area on 
Thursday. Both Friday and Saturday are transition days for park visitors, 
especially in the summer months. Saturdays do draw in more Annual Pass holders 
to the park, but that is the major day that people either arrive or leave the 
area. This causes attendance figures to be down, making it a perfect day to 
visit the parks.</p> 
<p>If you are planning to have a day of rest in your vacation, by arriving on 
Thursday you can enjoy two days of parks with reduced crowds and then use 
Sunday to rest. If during those first two days you are planning to visit the 
Magic Kingdom, plan to do it on Friday. Attendance figures pick up for that 
park on Saturday. You will be able to do more attractions in the first two days 
while you are revved up, and then it will allow you to relax and enjoy the park 
on the more crowded days.</p> 
<h2>[edit] Talk</h2> 
<p>As in most places in the United States, <b>English</b> is the default 
language throughout the Walt Disney World Resort. The cast members at World 
Showcase in Epcot are largely citizens of the featured countries, and so will 
be fluent in their native tongues as well as English. Other cast members 
throughout the property may also be bi- or tri-lingual; any such cast members 
can be identified by language signs on their name tags, representing the 
languages they speak . Spanish is also very common in Florida, and the US as a 
whole. Spanish speakers will not have any problems navigating the resort.</p> 
<p>All four theme parks have an information center known as <b>Guest Relations
</b>, near the main entrance. Cast members, who usually are multilingual, will 
be available here to answer any questions you may have.</p> 
<p><b>Disney's Ears to the World</b> is an audio headset that provides 
foreign-language translations of the dialogues of selected attractions in 
French, German, Japanese, Portuguese, or Spanish. It may be rented at Guest 
Relations, but there are a limited number of them available; a $25 deposit will 
be collected and refunded upon return.</p> 
<p>For guests with <b>visual disabilities</b>, linguistic services are in the 
form of audiocassette tour guides and Braille guidebooks, also available for 
rent at Guest Relations.</p> 
<p>For <b>hearing-impaired</b> guests, assistive listening devices and 
captioning (handheld, reflective, or video) are available for selected 
attractions. Cast Members with knowledge of<b>American Sign Language</b> can be 
identified by the appropriate symbol on their name tags, and interpreters are 
available by appointment.</p> 
<h2>[edit] Get in</h2> <br>
Welcome! 
<dl> 
<dd> <i>&quot;A person should set his goals as early as he can and devote all 
his energy and talent to getting there. With enough effort, he may achieve it. 
Or he may find something that is even more rewarding. But in the end, no matter 
what the outcome, he will know he has been alive.&quot;</i>  &mdash; Walt Disney
</dd> </dl> 
<h3>[edit] By plane</h3> 
<p><b>Why is it MCO and not ORL?</b> </p>
<p>If you're booking air travel to Orlando, you'll need to remember that <b>MCO
</b> airport code. The tourist-humor explanation is that MCO stands for 
&quot;Mickey and COmpany&quot;, but the abbreviation actually comes from the 
airport's original name, McCoy Air Force Base. The expected ORL code is 
assigned to the Orlando Executive Airport, a general-aviation facility located 
several miles north of Orlando International.</p> <br>
<br>

<p>Most visitors fly into <b>Orlando International Airport</b> (IATA: <b>MCO
</b>) [5], +1 407-825-2001. It is served by nearly all major US airlines and a 
wide range of international carriers. From there, you can rent a car, take a 
taxi, order a limo or towncar, or take<b>Disney's Magical Express</b> [6]: a 
free bus service from the airport to the Disney-owned resort hotels (prior 
reservations required, call 1-407-WDISNEY). Florida State Roads 528 (to the 
north) and 417 (to the south) link the airport with<b>Interstate 4</b>, which 
leads directly into Walt Disney World.</p> 
<p><b>Orlando-Sanford International Airport</b> (IATA: <b>SFB</b>) [7] is a 
bit farther away from Walt Disney World than Orlando International. Aside from 
domestic flights on Allegiant Air, the airport primarily handles flights from 
the United Kingdom and Iceland. Disney's Magical Express is<i>not</i> available 
here. Florida State Road 417 connects the airport to Interstate 4.</p> 
<h3>[edit] By car</h3> 
<p><b>Interstate 4</b> is the most direct driving route into Walt Disney 
World. Depending on your point of origin, the<b>Florida Turnpike</b> can be 
quite useful. This is particularly true when you might be arriving from Miami 
or other points south. If you will be arriving from a cruise at<b>Port Canaveral
</b>, Florida State Road 528 gets you to I-4, with Orlando International 
Airport and the Turnpike en route.</p> 
<h3>[edit] By train</h3> 
<p><b>Amtrak's</b> [8] <i><b>Silver Service</b></i> Miami&ndash;New York City 
routes serveOrlando and Kissimmee. Service is four times daily, with two trains 
in either direction. Northbound trains from Miami arrive at the Orlando station 
at 1:43 PM and 7:08 PM; southbound trains from NYC arrive at 10:17 AM and 12:55 
PM. The<i><b>Auto Train</b></i>, which can carry both passengers and 
automobiles, serves nearbySanford non-stop from Lorton, Virginia (near 
Washington, D.C.). </p> 
<h3>[edit] By bus</h3> 
<p><b>Disney's Magical Express</b> [9] has proven to be a very popular option 
for guests staying at Disney resort hotels; it provides free transportation to 
and from the airport. Be sure to book service ahead of time, though!</p> 
<p>The <b>Disney Cruise Line</b> [10] provides a similar bus service for their 
passengers, between the Walt Disney World resort hotels and their terminal at 
Port Canaveral. The one-way fare is $35 per person, although it's included in 
the price if you book a land-and-sea vacation package.</p> 
<p>If you're not staying at a Disney resort, or aren't coming in via Orlando 
International or Disney Cruise Line, you do have some other choices.<b>Mears 
Transportation</b> [11] is the big dog in the area; in fact, Disney contracts 
with them to run the Magical Express and the Disney Cruise Line buses. But they 
also run their own shuttle buses and town cars that can take you to any of the 
local attractions or hotels.</p> 
<p>Long-distance bus company <b>Greyhound</b> [12] serves both Orlando and 
Kissimmee, with the latter being closer to Walt Disney World.</p>

<h2>[edit] Tickets</h2> 
<p><b>Warning: Purchasing tickets online</b> </p>
<p>Many tickets sold online through auction websites such as eBay or 
Craigslist are partially used multi-day park-hopper tickets. While this is a 
very common activity, it is prohibited by Disney: the tickets are 
non-transferable. There is also an inherent risk to you as a buyer, because you 
don't know for certain how many days remain on the ticket. If you are 
purchasing tickets online, only purchase from authorized brokers; resold 
tickets are subject to rejection at the gate.</p> <br>
<br>

<p>Visiting Walt Disney World is a very expensive affair. Tickets are sold at 
several levels: the<b>Magic Your Way</b> base tickets cover the cost of 
visiting one of the four theme parks a day for each day of the ticket. On top 
of this, you can add the<b>Park Hopper</b> option, which allows you to enter 
multiple theme parks on the same day as many times as you like. You can also 
add the<b>Water Park Fun &amp; More</b> option, which grants admission to the 
two Disney water parks as well as other attractions. Each of those add-on 
options costs $55 above the cost of your tickets,<i>regardless of how many days 
are on your tickets</i>. Neither one is likely worth it if you buy only a 
one-day ticket, but their value goes up sharply as you add more days.</p> 
<p>The Park Hopper option in particular is often overlooked, but it's <i>
strongly recommended</i> because of the flexibility it offers. Without it, you 
could be stuck with nowhere else to go after doing everything you want to do at 
one park; or you could run out of time to do one last attraction and be unable 
to come back another day to pick it up. If you have seven-day tickets, it only 
costs about $7.50 a day to add this option; the value of being able to visit 
one park in the morning and another in the evening should not be underestimated.
</p> 
<p>With the Water Park Fun &amp; More option, you receive a number of 
admissions to attractions outside the four main parks. The number is equal to 
the number of days on your Magic Your Way ticket (or two admissions for one-day 
tickets), though they can be used anytime. You can use these admissions at
Typhoon Lagoon, Blizzard Beach, DisneyQuest, ESPN Wide World of Sports, or the 
nine-holeOak Trail golf course. If you visit just two of these attractions 
during your trip, the cost of the option will be covered by the money you save 
on admission.</p> 
<p>Multi-day tickets do not have to be used on consecutive days. However, 
these tickets will expire 14 days after they are first used, so be sure to use 
all the days purchased prior to that. A<b>no-expiration option</b> can be added 
to any multi-day ticket with at least one day remaining; with this option, the 
ticket expires when the last purchased day is used, which can be months or even 
years after the initial use. A side benefit of this option is locking in your 
admission price for your next visit(s). The price for this option is variable, 
based on the number of days purchased.</p> 
<p>The best feature of a Disney admission ticket is its flexibility. Options 
can be added even if the ticket has already been used at least once. For 
example, a base ticket (no park-hopping) can be upgraded to include 
park-hopping by paying the $55 cost for the option. Or, if a change in travel 
plans will not allow the user to utilize all purchased days prior to the 
ticket's expiration date, the &quot;no-expiration&quot; option can be purchased 
for the remaining days. These changes may be made at any ticket window or at 
the Guest Relations office inside each theme park as well as the Concierge desk 
at Disney Resort Hotels. Any ticket upgrades must be made within 14 days of the 
first date of use, and you have to still have some remaining value on the 
ticket.</p> 
<p><b>Too good to be true?</b> </p>
<p>Billboards along interstate highways in Florida and even southern Georgia 
promote the availability of cut-rate admission tickets for Walt Disney World 
and other central Florida theme parks. While these offers are genuine, there is 
often a catch. Many of these promotions require the buyer to tour a time-share 
resort and sit through a high-pressure sales pitch for the property prior to 
getting the tickets.</p> <br>

<p> Children under age three are admitted for free. </p> 
<p>There are <b>Magic Your Way Premium</b> and <b>Magic Your Way Platinum</b> 
packages available as well; they add some interesting luxury options to your 
vacation package. They both include the Deluxe Dining Plan, preferred fireworks 
viewing, unlimited access to select recreational activities, tours, and a 
portrait session. The Platinum package adds to that a spa treatment, a 
fireworks cruise, and more. If you're sure you're going to use the benefits 
these packages provide, they may just be worth the extra cost. Purchasing these 
packages does require booking and staying at a Disney owned resort hotel.</p> 
<p><b>Florida residents</b> who provide proof of residence get discounts of 
varying degrees, but they can't purchase beyond a 7-day ticket (meaning that 
Florida residents who ask for the discount can't purchase 8-, 9-, or 10-day 
tickets).<b>Annual passes</b> are also available for frequent visitors or 
residents.</p> 
<p><b>Disney resort guests</b> (those staying on-site at Disney hotels) are 
usually best served by getting package deals that include both lodging and 
admission.</p> 
<h2>[edit] Get around</h2> <br>
Walt Disney World Resort overview map 
<p>Getting around Walt Disney World is easy and often fun. You may walk, 
drive, or ride public transit (in this case, buses, monorails, or ferryboats). 
In most cases, the service is direct and non-stop. All Walt Disney World 
transit vehicles are wheelchair-accessible, and there is no additional fee to 
use any of them. If you are traveling with a stroller, you must take your child 
out of the stroller, then fold it and hand-carry it onto the vehicle.</p> 
<h3>[edit] By foot</h3> 
<p><b>A whole new world</b> </p>
<p>Walt Disney World and <b>Google Earth</b> have teamed up to create a 
comprehensive, state-of-the-art 3-D<b>virtual tour</b> of the resort. All four 
theme parks and over 20 Disney resort hotels are rendered as fully textured 3-D 
buildings in a special layer in Google Earth. It's a great way to get a feel 
for the lay of the land, or just to reminisce about a previous trip.</p> <br>

<br> 
<p>In some places, <b>walking</b> is the most convenient way to travel from 
one area to another. Epcot, Disney's Hollywood Studios, and the five resorts in 
between (Swan &amp; Dolphin, Yacht &amp; Beach Clubs, and Boardwalk) are 
connected by walkways, as is Downtown Disney to Disney's Saratoga Springs 
Resort. If you are staying at Disney's Contemporary Resort, you will find it 
quicker to walk to the Magic Kingdom than to take the ferry or monorail. From 
Shades of Green (a military-only resort) it's a five-minute walk to Disney's 
Polynesian Resort, to take the monorail or ferry to the Magic Kingdom; and from 
the Polynesian Resort it's another five-minute walk to the Transportation and 
Ticket Center, to take the monorail to Epcot.</p> 
<p>Keep in mind, though, that you'll be doing a lot of walking <i>within</i> 
the parks, especially at Epcot and Animal Kingdom, so don't tire yourself out 
early!</p> 
<p><b>Strollers</b>, <b>wheelchairs</b>, and <b>electric convenience vehicles
</b> (<b>ECVs</b>) are readily available to rent at the entrance to each park. 
If you have a problem standing too long, or if walking on the hot pavement 
makes your feet ache, renting a wheelchair or ECV can make a big difference. 
Wheelchairs can be brought up to the loading area of most rides, where you'll 
usually need to transfer to the ride vehicle. Both wheelchairs and ECVs are 
accommodated in most theater and stage attractions. Strollers will usually need 
to be left outside; most attractions have a designated stroller parking area.
</p> 
<p>A Single stroller rents for $15, or $13/day for multi-day rentals. Double 
strollers are $31, or $27/day. Wheelchairs are $12, or $10/day. ECVs are $50, 
with a $20 refundable deposit. Even if you park-hop, you only have to pay once 
per day; simply show a same-day receipt to avoid paying a second fee.</p> 
<h3>[edit] By bus</h3> <br>
Disney buses 
<p>Learn to love the ubiquitous Walt Disney World <b>bus system</b>. You'll be 
using it a lot, especially if you didn't bring a car.</p> 
<p>The bus routes are set up to facilitate travel from a resort to a park, but 
not from one resort to another or from one park to another. Most resorts have 
five bus routes originating from them, providing direct service to<b>all four 
theme parks and Downtown Disney</b>. Typhoon Lagoon and Blizzard Beach are 
served by the Downtown Disney and Animal Kingdom routes respectively.</p> 
<p>Disney's Boardwalk is actually part of a resort, so visitors from other 
resorts (except Swan/Dolphin or Yacht/Beach Clubs) will have to travel there 
via one of the parks. The most convenient option is Disney's Hollywood Studios, 
which has two connections to the Boardwalk: walking or ferry. (Although Epcot 
is the closest park to the Boardwalk, using it as an interchange is not 
recommended, as it would require entering through the main entrance and exiting 
out the back entrance, thereby costing the admission fee.)</p> 
<p>Note that there is no bus service to the Magic Kingdom or Epcot from the 
Magic Kingdom-area resorts; they are served by the monorail system. Likewise, 
service to Epcot and Disney's Hollywood Studios from the Epcot-area resorts is 
by ferry or walking. There is also no direct bus service between the theme 
parks and Downtown Disney. To travel to Downtown Disney from a theme park, or 
vice versa, you must travel to any resort and change buses. The most convenient 
resort for this purpose is Disney's Saratoga Springs Resort, which is right 
next door to Downtown Disney; you can get there via a pedestrian bridge, bus, 
or ferry.</p> 
<p>The buses are reliable, fairly efficient, and reasonably comfortable, but 
they can be slow and inconvenient if, for example, you are traveling with young 
children or strollers. Expect to wait up to fifteen minutes for a bus to your 
destination, and another ten to thirty minutes to get there&mdash;possibly 
longer during the busy season. Also keep in mind that guests in wheelchairs 
have first priority when boarding.</p> 
<h3>[edit] By monorail</h3> <br>
Monorail Coral 
<p>Walt Disney World's <b>monorail</b> system is one of its signature 
attractions, and it's not even inside one of the parks. They do a great job of 
getting large numbers of guests from place to place, but they're also quite 
comfortable and fun to ride.</p> 
<p>The monorail service is limited and only goes to certain areas, all 
originating from the<b>Transportation and Ticket Center</b> (<b>TTC</b>). There 
are three monorail lines:</p> 
<ul> 
<li><i>Express</i>: This route travels from the Transportation and Ticket 
Center (adjacent to the Magic Kingdom parking lot) to the Magic Kingdom gates 
and back, without stopping at the resorts. This is primarily used by Magic 
Kingdom guests who parked in the lot or are coming from Epcot. This route runs 
on the outer rail, counter-clockwise around Seven Seas Lagoon.</li> 
<li><i>Resort</i>: This route runs parallel to the Express route, clockwise on 
the inner rail, and stops at all the resorts it passes. The stops are, in 
order: Transportation and Ticket Center, Polynesian, Grand Floridian, Magic 
Kingdom, and Contemporary. This route is used by resort guests to get to the 
Magic Kingdom or Epcot, and by guests visiting one of the resorts.</li> 
<li><i>Epcot</i>: This route travels between the Transportation and Ticket 
Center and the Epcot gates. When entering Epcot this way, the monorail makes a 
nice loop in the park before arriving at the station, giving a great aerial 
view of Future World and the World Showcase.</li> </ul> 
<p>If you are going to Epcot from the Polynesian Resort, you may walk to the 
Transportation and Ticket Center to get to the Epcot monorail; it's usually 
faster than taking the Resort monorail completely through the loop. It is also 
possible to walk to the TTC from Disney's Wilderness Lodge, which is not 
connected to the monorail. The distance is about half a mile, and takes around 
10 minutes.</p> 
<h3>[edit] By boat</h3> 
<p>Walt Disney World also has several waterways which are used by <b>ferryboats
</b> to transport guests. </p> 
<ul> 
<li>From the Magic Kingdom, large ferries transport guests to the 
Transportation and Ticket Center, adjacent to the parking lot. Smaller ferries 
travel to the Contemporary, Grand Floridian, Polynesian, Fort Wilderness 
Campground, and Wilderness Lodge.</li> 
<li>From Epcot and Disney's Hollywood Studios, service is to the Swan/Dolphin, 
Yacht/Beach Club, and Boardwalk.</li> 
<li>From Downtown Disney, service is to Saratoga Springs, Old Key West, and 
the two Port Orleans resorts.</li> </ul> 
<h3>[edit] By car</h3> 
<p>If you are staying on-site, a <b>car</b> is not necessary, unless you wish 
to travel off-property during your stay. Some people purchase groceries to use 
during their stay; while there are a couple of places on the property to buy 
them, better selection and prices are found off property. Other people use a 
car to avoid the delays that can sometimes affect the public transportation 
options.</p> 
<p>If you are staying at a hotel off Disney property, on the other hand, a car 
is strongly recommended. Many off-resort hotels offer shuttle service to the 
parks, but the schedules may not be convenient.</p> 
<p>Getting around Walt Disney World by car is not much of a problem. All you 
need to do is follow the purple directional signs with black Mickey Mouse ears 
to your destination. Your WDW resort will also provide a map of the complex. If 
you run into problems, just drop by the<b>Walt Disney World Car Care Center</b> 
on World Drive, near the Magic Kingdom toll plaza.</p> 
<p>The five golf courses (see below)&nbsp;are accessible only by car; however, 
complimentary taxi service is available for guests of Disney-owned hotels.</p> 
<h4>[edit] Rent</h4> 
<p>Several car rental agencies have locations on Walt Disney World property: 
</p> 
<ul> 
<li><b>Alamo</b> and <b>National</b>, which are both owned by the same 
company, have dual locations in three places:
<ul> 
<li>WDW Car Care Center (near the Magic Kingdom toll plaza), +1 407 824-3470 
</li> 
<li>Walt Disney World Dolphin Hotel, +1 407 934-4930 </li> 
<li>Buena Vista Palace (in the Downtown Disney Hotel Plaza), +1 407 827-6363 
</li> </ul> </li> 
<li><b>Avis</b> at the Hilton in the Hotel Plaza. +1 407 827-2847 </li> 
<li><b>Budget</b> at the Doubletree in the Hotel Plaza. +1 407 827-6089 </li> 
<li><b>Dollar</b> at the Regal Sun Resort in the Hotel Plaza. +1 407 583-8000 
</li> 
<li><b>Hertz</b> at Shades of Green. +1 407 938-0600 </li> 
<li><b>U-Save</b> at the Best Western in the Hotel Plaza. +1 407 938-9585 </li>
</ul> 
<h4>[edit] Fuel</h4> 
<p>There are three Hess gas stations within the resort: at the Car Care Center 
on World Drive, on Buena Vista Drive near the entrance to Hollywood Studios, 
and on Buena Vista Drive across from Downtown Disney. The Hess stations on 
Disney property do charge market rate for their fuel, unlike a few Orlando gas 
stations where the cost of fuel is still outrageous despite the recent drop in 
gas prices. Gas stations along State Road 535 (Apopka-Vineland Road) near the 
Downtown Disney Hotel Plaza are notorious for pricing well above the market 
rate for fuel.</p> 
<p>However, for sheer <i>chutzpah</i>, you gotta hand it to Suncoast Energys, 
located on State Road 436 (Semoran Boulevard), just outside the Orlando 
International Airport. Its location across the street from the Hertz and 
Thrifty rental-car lots makes it a tempting top-off-the-tank stop, but be sure 
you take note of the pump price, which is usually $1.50-$2<i>higher</i> than 
the local average.</p> 
<p>Visit <b>Orlando Gas Prices</b> [15] to find the local average price and 
get addresses for other handy gas stations.</p> 
<h4>[edit] Parking</h4> 
<p>The parking fee at the four theme park lots is $14 for most vehicles 
(campers and trailers are $15; buses and tractor trailers are $18). Parking is 
free, though, for guests staying at any of the on-site Disney Resorts (your Key 
to the World card serves as your parking ticket), or who have a valid Annual 
Pass. The four theme park lots are huge, and are divided into subsections; this 
is to enable you to remember your car's location. To save you from having to 
walk the long distances, there are trams that will shuttle you from the parking 
lot to the park gates and back (except in the case of the Magic Kingdom, where 
the tram will take you to the Transportation and Ticket Center, from which you 
may take the ferry or the monorail to the park).</p> 
<p>Parking at the two water parks or Downtown Disney is free. However, there 
are no parking lot trams available, so be prepared to walk.</p> 
<p>Valet parking is available at Deluxe resorts (see the Sleep section) for 
$12/day.</p> 
<h2>[edit] See and Do</h2> 
<p><b>Never completed</b> </p>
<p>Walt Disney once said himself that &quot;Disneyland will never be 
completed.&quot; Well, neither will Walt Disney World. The resort has changed 
dramatically over the years, and many things have come and gone like magic. 
Revisit the Walt Disney World of the past at<b>Walt Dated World</b> [16] or <b>
Yesterland</b> [17] (scroll down to the section labeled &quot;Yester 
World&quot;)</p> <br>
<br>

<dl> 
<dd> <i>&quot;Here in Florida, we have something special we never enjoyed at 
Disneyland &mdash; the blessing of size. There's enough land here to hold all 
the ideas and plans we can possibly imagine.&quot;</i>  &mdash; Walt Disney 
</dd> </dl> 
<h3>[edit] Theme Parks</h3> 
<p><b>It's a small world, after all</b> </p>
<p>Walt Disney World and Verizon Wireless have teamed up to introduce a number 
of amenities for<b>mobile phone</b> users. </p>
<p>For Verizon customers with Android phones or iPhones, <b>Disney Mobile Magic
</b> is an interactive theme park map application complete with features such 
as games, messages from Disney characters, and finding wait times for rides. 
The application may be acquired at the Verizon Media Store[18], the iTunes App 
Store[19], or by texting &quot;MAGIC&quot; to 2777 from a Verizon phone. </p>
<p>For non-Verizon phones, a text-message interface [20] is available; ride 
wait times, character appearances, park hours, and exclusive offers can all be 
sent directly to your phone. Just register your phone at the website and you 
can get started; normal text-messaging rates apply.</p>
<p>Finally, the official Walt Disney World mobile website [21] may be accessed 
through a mobile phone browser. However, this site will only contain basic park 
information like park hours and entertainment schedules, and will only provide 
limited information about wait times and FastPass return times.</p> <br>
<br>

<p>The four <b>theme parks</b> are Walt Disney World's bread and butter. These 
are not traditional amusement parks, where age is a hindrance to full 
enjoyment. The Disney parks have rides, sure, but many of them are quite sedate 
and can be enjoyed by everyone, not just those with a high tolerance for 
thrills. And even beyond the rides, there are stage shows to watch, shops to 
browse, characters to meet, and atmosphere to soak in.</p> 
<p>Most importantly, though, none of these rides, shows, and stores just 
&quot;sits there&quot;. Each one<b>tells a story</b>, in much the same way that 
Disney's animated films do, and each is crafted with the utmost care and 
attention to detail. There are also the bigger stories to be found in each 
themed land, and in the park as a whole. When you enter the Magic Kingdom, and 
the entrance tunnels give way to the vista of Main Street, with Cinderella 
Castle at the far end, you're<b>raising the curtain</b> on a new 
production&mdash;and you're the featured player.</p> 
<p>You won't find dirt or peeling paint or run-down mechanics at a Disney 
Park, not even at the oldest attractions. Disney takes quality very seriously, 
and if anything intrudes on your perception of the &quot;show&quot;, it gets 
fixed quickly. It's all about<b>suspension of disbelief</b>: total immersion 
into worlds of imagination, art, and history.</p> 
<p>The <b>sheer number of attractions</b>&mdash;including rides, stage shows, 
parades, and fireworks displays&mdash;at Walt Disney World's four theme parks 
can be intimidating to guests. It's usually best to have a plan going in. Check 
the guide map for the park you plan to visit and decide which attractions will 
be your highest priorities<i>before</i> you leave for the park. Keep in mind 
that parades and some shows occur only at specific times, and plan your route 
to put you nearby in time to get a seat. Be flexible, though&mdash;once you've 
hit your priority attractions, you can go back and pick up more if you have 
time remaining.</p> 
<p>The traditional amusement park advice of arriving early and heading to the 
<b>back of the park first</b> tends to work well, although more and more guests 
are starting to catch on, so the benefit may be reduced.</p> 
<p>Be aware that during the busiest times of year, lines can be <b>up to two 
hours long</b> for the most popular attractions. One option for avoiding these 
lines is the free service known as<b>FastPass</b>, available only at select 
attractions. Simply insert your park ticket into the machine, and you'll get a 
FastPass ticket with a time interval stamped on it. At any time during that 
interval, you may enter the attraction using a separate, shorter queue. You can 
only have one FastPass at a time, so you won't avoid<i>every</i> line, but it 
can still be a great time-saver. Note that the FastPass queues may bypass some 
or all of the scenery and theming found in the longer lines, which for some 
guests is a significant part of the Disney experience. Consider what you may be 
missing if you choose to get a FastPass.</p> 
<h4>[edit] The Magic Kingdom</h4> <br>
Cinderella Castle, Magic Kingdom 
<p>The <b>Magic Kingdom</b> is the main park, based on the original Disneyland 
in Anaheim, California. It is organized around the central landmark of 
Cinderella Castle, with various &quot;lands&quot; arrayed around a central hub. 
The lands are, starting from the main entrance and going clockwise around 
Cinderella Castle: Main Street USA, Adventureland, Frontierland, Liberty 
Square, Fantasyland, and Tomorrowland.</p> 
<p>The park is the oldest, most popular, and the most child-friendly, although 
many adults love it as well. Adult visitors who do not enjoy rides such as<b>
it's a small world</b>, where you sit in vehicles that take you in a circle 
through a tunnel as animatronic figures sing children's songs to the riders, 
may want to visit Epcot or Hollywood Studios instead. On the other hand, roller 
coasters like<b>Space Mountain</b> and <b>Big Thunder Mountain Railroad</b> 
provide plenty of thrills, and dark rides like the<b>Haunted Mansion</b> and <b>
Pirates of the Caribbean</b> are classics that only the most curmudgeonly would 
dismiss.</p> 
<p>The lines at the Magic Kingdom can be endless, but they always keep moving. 
Though the FastPass system works well, it is not available for all attractions. 
Even just walking around, you will likely encounter bottlenecks where there are 
huge masses of people, and they all seem to be going to the same place you are. 
Then there's the food and the merchandise, which can be pricey, but not too bad 
considering where you are. Despite it all, most people would agree that the 
lines, the crowds, and the prices are worth it for the experience.</p> 
<h4>[edit] Epcot</h4> 
<p><b>Epcot</b> is an &quot;educational park.&quot; It is divided into two 
distinct areas, Future World and World Showcase. Future World features eight 
indoor pavilions, each one focused on a specific area of human achievement or 
endeavor. World Showcase replicates, on a small scale but with great attention 
to detail, eleven of the world's nations, complete with authentic food and 
merchandise.</p> 
<p>Don't miss the cheesy but fun <b>Gran Fiesta Tour Starring The Three 
Caballeros</b> ride in the Mexico pavilion, or the extravagant <b>Maelstrom</b> 
ride in the Norway pavilion. In Future World, the<b>Test Track</b>, a recent 
addition in which visitors go through the motions of tests for new cars, is 
probably the most fun, and the most traditionally theme-park-y, of the Epcot 
rides. Recent additions to the park include<b>Soarin'</b>, a ride where 
visitors &quot;hang-glide&quot; through many landscapes, and<b>Mission: SPACE
</b>, a centrifugal spaceflight simulator. </p> 
<p>Epcot has a bit of a reputation as a more &quot;grown-up&quot; park. While 
some of the slower, more intellectual attractions may be over the heads of the 
youngest visitors, the park still has plenty to keep them entertained. Of 
course there are character greetings, especially at World Showcase, but there 
are also<b>Kidcot Fun Stops</b>, which encourage children to work on a craft 
and interact with cast members who are representing their home countries.<b>The 
Seas with Nemo &amp; Friends</b> is great fun for fans of <i>Finding Nemo</i>, 
too.</p> 
<h4>[edit] Disney's Hollywood Studios</h4> <br>
Indy finds an idol 
<p><b>Disney's Hollywood Studios</b> (formerly Disney-MGM Studios) opened in 
May 1989 as the third theme park of Walt Disney World. The park is themed 
around film and television, and features a variety of live shows and 
attractions based on some of the most iconic productions in Hollywood history.
</p> 
<p>Among the attractions are a few exceptional thrill rides, most notably <b>
The Twilight Zone Tower of Terror</b> (which drops you 13 stories) and the <b>
Rock 'n' Roller Coaster Starring Aerosmith</b> (which launches you 0&ndash;60 
in 2.8 seconds). The 3-D shooting gallery<b>Toy Story Mania!</b> also grabs big 
crowds, as does the<i>Star Wars</i>-based simulator ride <b>Star Tours: The 
Adventures Continue</b>. </p> 
<h4>[edit] Disney's Animal Kingdom</h4> 
<p><b>Disney's Animal Kingdom</b>, a member of the Association of Zoos and 
Aquariums, is a wildlife discovery park, a mix between a zoo and a theme park. 
Naturalistic animal exhibitions are interspersed, and sometimes integrated, 
with typical Disney rides. Among these are<b>Kilimanjaro Safaris</b>, a jeep 
safari past live animal enclosures;<b>Kali River Rapids</b>, a raft ride 
through the deforestation of a tropical rainforest;<b>Dinosaur</b>, a time 
travel ride which includes close encounters with dinosaurs; and the newest and 
most popular ride,<b>Expedition Everest</b>, a roller coaster that includes an 
encounter with the Yeti.</p> 
<p>The park is organized in a Magic Kingdom-like format, with different 
continents revolving around the central Tree of Life. While light on rides, 
there are also shows and plenty of animals to view (though the variety of 
species seems a bit sparse when compared to many larger city zoos). Animal 
Kingdom is more of a kid-friendly theme park with many animals that would 
attract the attention of younger generations as well as<b>Camp Minnie-Mickey</b>
, a special space for youngsters where they can meet all of their favorite 
characters.</p> 
<h3>[edit] Meet the characters</h3> 
<p>Especially for kids, <b>character greetings</b> are one of the most 
exciting reasons to visit Disney World. Kids and adults alike can give hugs to, 
take a photo with, or get autographs from many of their favorite Disney 
characters. Some kids like to bring or purchase a special autograph book in 
which the characters can inscribe their names.</p> 
<p>Character appearances tend to be surprises (to avoid huge lines), so keep a 
close eye out. If there's a character your child really wants to see, you can 
ask at Guest Relations if they know of any upcoming appearances, but nothing is 
ever guaranteed. And remember that it's hot inside those character costumes; 
sometimes the character has to leave even if there are people still waiting to 
say hello. It's disappointing but necessary for safety.</p> 
<p>Most often, character greetings will happen in the parks, in particular the 
Magic Kingdom, but they can happen just about anywhere! The Magic Kingdom does 
have the widest variety of characters, though; everyone from<b>Mickey Mouse</b> 
to<b>Captain Jack Sparrow</b>. Disney's &quot;Big Six&quot; (Mickey, Minnie, 
Donald, Daisy, Goofy, and Pluto) might be found anywhere in the park&mdash;for 
example, you might see Donald Duck in a Davy Crockett-like outfit in 
Frontierland. Other characters stick to the themed land most appropriate for 
their genre: Jack Sparrow in Adventureland, Buzz Lightyear in Tomorrowland, and 
so on.</p> 
<p>At the other parks, character appearances are somewhat rarer. At Epcot, for 
instance, you'll generally only find characters who hail from one of the themed 
foreign lands of World Showcase&mdash;Mulan in the China pavilion, for example. 
Hollywood Studios and Animal Kingdom tend to have more structured greetings, 
where characters will make scheduled appearances at designated locations, but 
stay out of sight of most of the park. Kids looking for autographs won't want 
to miss<b>Camp Minnie-Mickey</b> at Animal Kingdom, though; there are always at 
least a few characters there happy to meet some young guests.</p> 
<p>If you miss out on random encounters with the characters, be sure to look 
into<b>character dining</b> options. While restaurants that offer character 
dining are<i>extremely popular</i>, if you can get a table, you're virtually 
guaranteed a few minutes of face time with the characters. SeeCharacter Dining 
in the Eat section, below.</p> 
<h3>[edit] Pin trading</h3> 
<p>The <b>trading of commemorative pins</b> has been popular at Olympic Games 
for decades. At the turn of the millennium, Disney decided to get in on the act 
and began creating metallic lapel pins specifically for trading. The monster 
they created has endured for over a decade, and it has grown to mythic 
proportions. More than<b>60,000 different pin designs</b> have been produced 
since the beginning.</p> 
<p>Getting started is easy. Most every store has pins for sale, along with 
lanyards on which to display them. These pins are not very valuable, so you'll 
need to trade up to get the more interesting (and much more rare) pins. The 
most reliable way to do so is to keep an eye out for Cast Members wearing pin 
lanyards. Cast Members are required to trade one-for-one if asked (up to two 
per guest per day) and can't refuse a trade based on pin rarity or design 
(although they can refuse to accept another copy of a pin they already have 
displayed). Cast Members with green lanyards will trade only to kids under 13.
</p> 
<p>You can also trade with your fellow guests, and here things can get 
interesting. You may need to offer several more common pins to get your hands 
on a single rare pin. Dedicated traders carry a supply of common pins for just 
this purpose. Your best way to find people willing to trade is to head to a 
dedicated pin kiosk or store, such as the one underneath the Sorcerer's Hat at 
Hollywood Studios, but there is also ample opportunity for trading while 
waiting in lines or while riding the monorail or bus.</p> 
<p>Some tours and special events have unique pins that can only be obtained by 
participants. These pins are thus<i>very rare</i> and <i>highly coveted</i>. 
Make sure you (and especially your kids) don't trade these pins away without 
getting something really nice in return&mdash;but even then, think very 
carefully. Many people treat these more as souvenirs than commodities.</p> 
<h3>[edit] Tours</h3> 
<p>Each of the theme parks offers at least one <b>tour</b>, some of which are 
very popular. For an extra fee, a cast member will take you and a small group 
and introduce you to some of the &quot;secrets&quot; behind Disney operations. 
Many of these tours go into backstage areas where guests are not normally 
allowed, although children may be restricted from these to avoid spoiling the 
&quot;magic&quot;.</p> 
<p>The gold standard among the tours is the <b>Keys to the Kingdom</b> tour at 
theMagic Kingdom, a five-hour tour that includes a peek into the park's 
Utilidors. AtEpcot, the <b>Around the World at Epcot</b> tour is a great chance 
to try out Segway vehicles, and there are several tours at<b>The Seas with Nemo 
&amp; Friends</b> that take you into the huge aquarium to get up close to the 
animals who live there. The newest tour offering is the<b>Wild Africa Trek</b> 
atAnimal Kingdom, which will let you go on-foot into some remote areas of the 
park's African savanna and forest.</p> 
<h3>[edit] Water Parks</h3> 
<p>Walt Disney World's two water parks, <b>Blizzard Beach</b> near Animal 
Kingdom and <b>Typhoon Lagoon</b> near Downtown Disney, are the most-visited 
water parks in the world, with a combined total yearly attendance of almost 4 
million. Unlike most ordinary water parks, each has a unique central theme. 
Blizzard Beach brings to life the absurdity of what would happen if a ski 
resort suddenly melted, while Typhoon Lagoon makes use of the runoff from a 
tropical storm for sliding and floating fun.</p> 
<p>Both parks are big enough to spend several hours sliding, floating, or just 
soaking up the sun. Counter-service restaurants provide for a hearty lunch. If 
you have an extra $250 to spend, consider renting a private cabana for the day; 
they come with towels, lockers, a cabana attendant, and all the bottled water 
you can drink.</p> 
<h3>[edit] Shopping, dining, and nightlife</h3> <br>
Disney's Boardwalk 
<p>Sometimes you just want to get away from the theme parks for a while. Maybe 
do some shopping, have a quiet meal, or get away from the kids and go out 
dancing.</p> 
<p><b>Downtown Disney</b> is just what the doctor ordered: an outdoor 
shopping, dining, and entertainment paradise, geared primarily toward adults. 
Most of the entertainment activities are found on<b>Downtown Disney West Side
</b>; the featured attraction is the Cirque du Soleil show <i><b>La Nouba</b>
</i>. <b>DisneyQuest</b>, a five-story indoor theme park focusing on 
interactive &quot;virtual&quot; rides and featuring some of the most innovative 
technology at Disney World, is also on the West Side. The east side, known as<b>
Downtown Disney Marketplace</b>, is made up largely of shops and family 
restaurants.</p> 
<p><b>Disney's BoardWalk</b>, located next to Epcot, is a smaller collection 
of nightlife themed as a 1920's Eastern Seaboard boardwalk. The Boardwalk is 
also home to carnival midway games, tandem bike rentals, the<b>Atlantic Dance 
Hall</b>, and the <b>ESPN Club</b>. </p> 
<h3>[edit] Sporting activities</h3> 
<p>Often overlooked during a Walt Disney World vacation&mdash;whether due to 
time constraints or just lack of knowledge&mdash;are several recreational 
activities that have nothing to do with theme parks and rides.</p> 
<h4>[edit] Golf</h4> 
<p>Walt Disney World is home to four 18-hole championship <b>golf courses</b>, 
plus a nine-hole walking course and two different<b>miniature golf</b> 
experiences.[22] </p> 
<p>The <b>Lake Buena Vista</b> and <b>Osprey Ridge Golf Courses</b> are in the 
Downtown Disney area; they're the most scenic of the courses. The <b>Magnolia
</b> and <b>Palm</b> courses, which host the PGA Tour's <b>Children's Miracle 
Network Classic</b>, are in the Magic Kingdom area, adjacent to the Shades of 
Green resort. The four championship courses require standard golf attire, and 
metal cleats are not allowed. Golf clubs are available for rent. A golf cart 
must be used, but it is included in your greens fee.</p> 
<p>The <b>Oak Trail Golf Course</b>, in the Magic Kingdom area next to the 
Magnolia and Palm courses, is a nine-hole walking course. It's designed for 
less-experienced golfers and older children. The same rules and regulations 
apply here as at the championship courses, except golf carts are prohibited.</p>
<p>The five golf courses can be reached only via car or, in some limited 
cases, walking. The Disney-owned resorts offer complimentary taxi vouchers for 
their guests traveling to the golf courses. For more information or assistance, 
or to reserve a tee time, call +1 407 WDW-GOLF (939-4653). Tee times can be 
reserved up to 90 days in advance if you're staying at a Disney hotel (up to 60 
days in advance otherwise).</p> 
<p>The miniature golf courses are <b>Fantasia Gardens</b>, across the street 
from the Walt Disney World Swan Hotel in theEpcot resort area, and <b>Winter 
Summerland</b>, right next to Blizzard Beach. Each has two 18-hole layouts, 
with whimsical, kid-friendly holes and decor.</p> 
<h4>[edit] Watersports</h4> 
<p>Walt Disney World boasts a number of expansive waterways, and that means <b>
boating</b> and other <b>watersports</b> can be a great way to spend a few 
hours away from the parks.</p> 
<p>The Magic Kingdom-area resorts each have a small <b>marina</b> with a 
selection of recreational boats, but it's the Contemporary Resort that boasts<b>
Sammy Duvall's Watersports</b>. You don't have to be staying at the 
Contemporary to enjoy the marina's offerings; you might try waterskiing, 
wakeboarding, or even parasailing!</p> 
<p>At the Yacht Club Resort (adjacent to the Boardwalk), <b>Bayside Marina</b> 
offers SeaRaycers, pontoon boats, and a variety of chartered cruises, including 
an<b>IllumiNations</b> fireworks cruise to Epcot. At Downtown Disney, <b>
Captain Jack's Marina</b> will rent you a &quot;water mouse&quot; or canopy 
boat, or take you out for a bass fishing excursion.</p> 
<h4>[edit] Other</h4> 
<p>The <b>Walt Disney World Speedway</b> is located south of the Magic Kingdom 
and offers both Indy car and NASCAR-style racing experiences, although neither 
is cheap.</p> 
<p>On the other hand, if spectator sports are more your speed, you may want to 
check out the<b>ESPN Wide World of Sports</b>, a state-of-the-art sports 
complex nearHollywood Studios. The biggest event there is in March, when the 
Atlanta Braves host spring training baseball games, but there are events all 
year, especially high school and collegiate-level sports.</p> 
<h3>[edit] Spas and health clubs</h3> 
<p>If you feel the need for a bit of pampering, Walt Disney World's <b>spa</b> 
facilities offer a full array of massage, skin, and nail treatments. The<b>Spa 
at Disney's Saratoga Springs</b> near Downtown Disney recalls the heyday of 
Saratoga Springs, New York, with its healing mineral baths. The spa is operated 
by<b>Niki Bryan Spas</b> [23]. </p> 
<p>The <b>Grand Floridian Spa &amp; Health Club</b>, also run by Niki Bryan 
Spas, will be closing on September 19, 2011, for 18 months, due to nearby 
construction.</p> 
<p><b>Mandara Spa</b> [24] has a facility at the Walt Disney World Dolphin near
Epcot, and there's also the <b>Buena Vista Palace Hotel &amp; Spa</b> at the 
Downtown Disney Hotel Plaza. </p> 
<p> </p> 
<h2>[edit][add listing] Buy</h2> 
<p><b>Troublesome souvenirs</b> </p>
<p>Bear in mind that <b>snowglobes</b>, a very popular gift item found at Walt 
Disney World, may<i>not</i> be brought into an airplane cabin, under Department 
of Homeland Security regulations concerning the transport of liquids, gels, and 
aerosols. If you purchase a snowglobe and will be traveling by air, ask your 
sales representative for one of two options: package it securely so you can 
place it in checked luggage, or have it shipped back to your home for a fee.</p>
<p>Similarly, stores selling <b>knives</b> and <b>swords</b>, such as chef's 
knives and<i>katana</i> swords at the Mitsukoshi store in Epcot's Japan 
pavilion, are required to ship the purchase to the buyer's home; these items 
will be shipped free of charge to U.S. addresses.</p> <br>

</i> &mdash; Scrooge McDuck </dd> </dl> 
<p>Finding <b>souvenirs</b> is one of the easiest things to do at Walt Disney 
World; avoiding the expense is considerably harder. Many attractions, 
especially the most popular ones, route their exit queues directly into a 
merchandise store, usually one themed to the attraction. (In fact, several 
rides even take your picture, which will be available for purchase in the 
shop.) On the bright side, this does make it easier to find merchandise with a 
particular theme.Disney's Hollywood Studios is a particularly rich source of 
themed merchandise, especially for fans of Indiana Jones,<i>Star Wars</i>, and 
the Muppets.</p> 
<p>Sometimes overlooked by shoppers are the various resorts. All of the 
resorts have a gift shop of some sort, but many go further. The<b>Grand Canyon 
Concourse</b> on the fourth floor of Disney's Contemporary Resort, underneath 
the monorail platform, has several specialty shops selling merchandise such as 
jewelry, sundries, and housewares.<b>Zawadi Marketplace</b> at Disney's Animal 
Kingdom Lodge has unique African merchandise not available elsewhere. At 
Disney's Boardwalk, look for the<b>Wyland Galleries</b>, with underwater-themed 
prints and paintings, featuring the work of the artist Wyland. In fact, each of 
the resorts has something a little different that you won't find elsewhere on 
the property, and it can be fun to look for those little hidden gems.</p> 
<p>Realizing that many of its souvenirs such as the giant Mickey dolls simply 
aren't made to be lugged around a theme park all day, Disney will save the day 
with its<b>package pickup</b> and <b>package delivery</b> services, available 
at all Disney-run stores. Guests staying at an on-site resort hotel can have 
their purchases delivered to their hotel gift shop, while everyone else can 
have their purchases held at the Package Pick-Up window at the front gate of 
each theme park. The service is free of charge, but be sure to factor in 
delivery times&mdash;allow 24 hours for a package to be delivered to your 
hotel, or about three hours for it to reach the front gate of the park.</p> 
<p>If you're stuck at home and dying to get some merchandise from the parks, 
you're in luck:</p>

<p>Like everything else, food is expensive at Walt Disney World. Fortunately, 
the food is pretty good, top to bottom.</p> 
<p>At the bottom you'll find portable food carts and fast counter-service (or 
&quot;quick-service&quot; in Disney's parlance) options. Once upon a time, 
these options were dismal; each counter service location served the same bland 
menu of burgers and chicken fingers, to the point where even the kids were sick 
of them by the end of your vacation. Happily, this has all changed in the last 
15 years or so.</p> 
<p>The small stands usually sell pre-packaged treats and snacks. The 
counter-service restaurants are on par with most chain fast-food joints in 
quality, but significantly more expensive in price. Still, it's not your 
typical amusement park fare; some of them are in fact quite good, and there's a 
lot of variety to be had. Three excellent options are<b>Cosmic Ray's Starlight 
Cafe</b> in Tomorrowland at the Magic Kingdom, the <b>Seasons Food Court</b> at 
The Land pavilion inEpcot, and <b>Flame Tree Barbecue</b> on Discovery Island at
Animal Kingdom. The <b>ABC Commissary</b> at Hollywood Studios has a 
surprisingly international menu, and<b>Toy Story Pizza Planet</b> in the same 
park has arcade games to pass the time.</p> 
<p>For the lowest possible prices, there is one <b>McDonald's</b> restaurant 
on WDW property, at the intersection of Buena Vista Drive and Osceola Parkway, 
between Blizzard Beach and the All-Star resort hotels.</p> 
<p>Moving up the scale, there is a fairly big gap between the counter-service 
and the lower-end table-service restaurants. If anything can be said to fill 
that gap, it's the buffets, but there are not many around, and most of them 
feature walk-around characters. For table service, you'll find the menus tend 
to be surprisingly limited; although the food is generally good, if your party 
has a lot of picky eaters you may have trouble finding a restaurant everyone 
can agree on. (Fortunately, Disney is<i>very</i> accommodating of special 
requests, so don't be afraid to ask for the demi-glace to be left off or to 
substitute fries for the au-gratin potatoes.)</p> 
<p>At the high-end of Disney dining, you'll find some options on par with the 
best in the country, including perhaps the fanciest restaurant in all ofCentral 
Florida, <b>Victoria and Albert's</b> at the Grand Floridian. These high-end 
restaurants do tend to be found at the resorts; few people want to go out to a 
fancy dinner after walking around the parks all day without changing first. 
Don't feel like you have to leave the kids behind, either; every restaurant on 
property (except Victoria and Albert's) welcomes kids and will accommodate them 
as best as they can.</p> 
<p>If a dietary restriction requires you to bring your own food into the 
parks, it is permissible to do so, on the condition that it does not require 
heating or any other kind of preparation. To ensure freshness, carry it in an 
insulated lunch box or bag. Keep in mind, though, that Florida Department of 
Health regulations prohibit Disney's Culinary Cast Members from preparing, or 
even handling, foods brought in by guests.</p> 
<h3>[edit] Prices</h3> 
<p>Walt Disney World uses a four-part &quot;dollar sign&quot; dining price 
classification system:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>$: $14.99 and under </li> 
<li>$$: $15 &ndash; $29.99 </li> 
<li>$$$: $30 &ndash; $75.99 </li> 
<li>$$$$: $76+ </li> </ul> 
<p>Most counter service restaurants have $ ratings, and most table service 
restaurants are either $$ or $$$. &quot;Signature&quot; restaurants are usually 
$$$. Victoria and Albert's is the only restaurant with a $$$$ rating.</p> 
<h3>[edit] Character dining</h3> 
<p>One of the unique attractions of dining at Walt Disney World is the 
opportunity to interact up-close with favorite characters during Disney's<b>
character dining</b> meals. Needless to say, these opportunities are <i>
extremely popular</i>; for all practical purposes, advance reservations are <i>
required</i>. In exchange for planning ahead, though, you will get to meet and 
take pictures with the characters, making for a memorable experience.</p> 
<p>The range of characters to be found is enormous. Mickey and Minnie and the 
gang are the most common of course, at places like<b>Chef Mickey's</b> in the 
Contemporary Resort, but you might also find Mary Poppins at <b>1900 Park Fare
</b> at the Grand Floridian, or characters from Disney Junior at <b>Hollywood 
&amp; Vine</b> in Hollywood Studios. And of course the (fairy) godmother of 
them all is<b>Cinderella's Royal Table</b>, inside the castle in the Magic 
Kingdom, where little girls can indulge their princess fantasies to their 
hearts' content, so long as their parents can actually get reservations.</p> 
<h3>[edit] Disney Dining Plan</h3> 
<p>Guests purchasing a Disney vacation package with hotel stay are eligible to 
participate in the<b>Disney Dining Plan</b>. For a flat additional fee, the 
plan allows guests a set number of meals per person per night of their stay. 
The Disney Dining Plan is accepted at any Disney-run restaurant on the property
<i>except</i> Victoria and Albert's. In addition, all of the restaurants at 
Downtown Disney, even those run by outside companies, also accept the Dining 
Plan.</p> 
<p>The Dining Plan is available at three different levels (prices are 
approximate):</p> 
<dl> 
<dt> Magic Your Way package plus Quick-Service Dining&nbsp; </dt> 
<dd> Two quick-service meals and one snack per person per night. Cost: 
$35/night for adults and juniors, $12/night for children 3&ndash;9</dd> 
<dt> Magic Your Way package plus Dining&nbsp; </dt> 
<dd> One table-service meal, one quick-service meal, and one snack per person 
per night, plus one refillable mug per person. Cost: $52&ndash;54/night for 
adults and juniors, $15&ndash;16/night for children 3&ndash;9 (price depending 
on season)</dd> 
<dt> Magic Your Way package plus Deluxe Dining&nbsp; </dt> 
<dd> Three meals (table- or quick-service) and two snacks per person per 
night. Cost: $86&ndash;90/night for adults and juniors, $24&ndash;26/night for 
children 3&ndash;9</dd> </dl> 
<p>The Magic Your Way Premium and Platinum packages also include Deluxe 
Dining. The &quot;Wine and Dine&quot; option offered in previous years is no 
longer available. A &quot;snack&quot; as part of the dining plan is a single 
prepackaged item, piece of fruit, or soft drink at any counter-service, snack 
cart, or merchandise location.</p> 
<p>All dining plans also include a resort refillable drink mug. This plastic 
mug can be refilled at the quick service location at a guest's resort for their 
entire length of stay. It cannot be refilled in the parks, but during the hot 
summer months, you can fill it with water from the many water fountains.</p> 
<p>Some &quot;signature&quot; restaurants, plus the dinner shows, require <i>
two</i> table-service credits for one meal. These restaurants are Artist's 
Point, California Grill, Cinderella's Royal Table, Citricos, Flying Fish Cafe, 
Fulton's Crab House, the Hollywood Brown Derby, Jiko-The Cooking Place, 
Narcoossee's, Wolfgang Puck's The Dining Room, and Yachtsman Steakhouse, plus 
the Hoop-Dee-Doo Musical Revue, Mickey's Backyard BBQ, and Disney's Spirit of 
Aloha dinner shows. Le Cellier also requires two credits, but<i>only</i> for 
dinner. Room service, where available, also takes two table-service credits, 
except for pizza delivery.</p> 
<p>To use the Dining Plan, simply present your <b>Key to the World</b> card to 
your server. Gratuities are<i>not</i> included, but you can charge the tip to 
your room account with your Key to the World card.</p> 
<h3>[edit] Advance Dining Reservations</h3> 
<p>Walt Disney World restaurants do not take reservations, <i>per se</i>. 
Disney's system for its table-service restaurants is called<b>Advance Dining 
Reservations</b> (<b>ADRs</b>). An ADR is sort of like a restaurant FastPass. 
Essentially, when you make an ADR, you are reserving a spot on the restaurant's 
waiting list. When you arrive at the restaurant at your reserved time, you will 
immediately be placed at the top of the waiting list and get the next available 
table suitable for your party.</p> 
<p>The importance of ADRs cannot be understated. During the slowest times of 
the year, you may find you don't have any problem walking up to a restaurant 
and getting a seat within 15-30 minutes. If you don't particularly care where 
you eat, or are willing to eat early or late, you can probably get by without 
ADRs. But if you have your heart set on a particular restaurant, or you want to 
make sure you can eat right at noon or 6PM, you'll want an ADR. And if it's 
peak season, better safe than sorry; without an ADR you may find yourself 
searching high and low for a table even at 8PM.</p> 
<p>Of course, you can also get by without ADRs if you decide to only eat at 
counter-service restaurants (which don't take reservations at all).</p> 
<p>A few restaurants are so popular that they regularly fill up even during 
the slowest periods. ADRs are essential for these. The one that takes the cake 
is<b>Cinderella's Royal Table</b>, inside the castle in the Magic Kingdom, 
which is usually booked solid within minutes of reservations opening.<b>Le 
Cellier</b> in the Canada pavilion at Epcot has a reputation as the best 
steakhouse on the property and so is very popular.<b>Victoria and Albert's</b> 
at theGrand Floridian also strongly suggests ADRs so that you can get a menu 
customized to your tastes. ADRs are also a good idea for any of the dinner 
shows, and<i>any</i> meal featuring the Disney characters. </p> 
<p>To make Advance Dining Reservations, <i>do not</i> try to call the 
restaurants directly. Call Disney Dining at +1 407 WDW-DINE (daily 7AM-10PM ET) 
to make all of your reservations. ADRs are accepted up to 180 days in advance 
of the date of the reservation. If you want to get in to any of the restaurants 
mentioned above,<i>especially</i> Cinderella's Royal Table, start dialing at 
6:55 on the first day you can make the reservation, and keep hitting redial 
until you stop getting told they're closed.</p> 
<p>As of June 2009, you can book ADRs online. Go to Disney's restaurants page 
[25], find the restaurant you want to eat at, and see if it has an orange 
&quot;Book a Reservation&quot; button. Many people continue to stick with the 
tried-and-true phone call, though, because the operators can quickly suggest 
and check for alternatives if your first choices aren't available.</p> 
<p>Note that guests staying at a Disney-owned hotel are allowed to make ADRs 
for their<i>entire trip</i> on the 180th day before they arrive. That means you 
can make an ADR for the seventh day of your trip 186 days in advance; this is a 
big perk of staying at a Disney hotel.</p> 
<p>If you're already on your vacation, you can visit Guest Relations at any 
park or Downtown Disney, or even your hotel concierge, to book your ADRs. 
Restaurants frequently get cancellations, so don't be afraid to ask if that 
popular restaurant you've had your eye on has an opening tomorrow, especially 
if you're willing to eat early or late.</p> 
<p>In most cases, cancellations can be accommodated without penalty, 
especially if done in advance. However, select restaurants will charge a $10 
cancellation fee if the reservation is canceled fewer than 24 hours in advance. 
When making an ADR for one of those restaurants, the agent will ask for a 
credit card number; the card will<i>only</i> be charged for a no-show or a late 
cancellation. If you need to cancel an ADR, use the special cancellations line, 
+1 407-WDW-CNCL (939-2625).</p> 
<h3>[edit] In-park dining</h3> 
<p>Food is easier than easy to find in all four theme parks. In-park dining 
opportunities range from snack carts to the most common fast-food joints to the 
less common table service restaurants. Bear in mind that the hours between noon 
and 2PM are generally considered the &quot;peak&quot; dining time in the parks. 
If you find yourself eating lunch within this time frame, expect to wait 30 
minutes to an hour in line before being served, unless you have a reservation 
at a table service restaurant. As an alternative, some snack carts serve fairly 
large portions (such as smoked turkey legs in the Magic Kingdom's 
Frontierland), and have short lines most of the time.</p> 
<p>Every park has low cost meals in the $3&ndash;$4 range for kid meals and 
$6&ndash;$8 for adult meals at the sandwich shops, ethnic specialty nooks, 
cafeterias, and communal dining halls. They provide ample food for the money. 
You can often feed your whole family for little more than the cost of one 
expensive entr&eacute;e at any of the upscale restaurants.</p> 
<h3>[edit] Resort dining</h3> 
<p>All of the Disney Resorts have at least one restaurant, ranging from food 
courts and buffets all the way up to award-winning table-service restaurants. 
The Value resorts only have simple food courts, but the dining options expand 
as you go up the price scale. Best of all, some of the hotel restaurants have 
Disney character greetings.</p> 
<p>Most people, when visiting other hotels, make reservations at the resorts' 
buffets and sit-down restaurants. However, what they don't always realize is 
that some of the hotels' most delicious and unique foods can be found in their 
food courts and smaller dining areas&mdash;and they're cheap, too. Check out 
some of these hidden gems:</p> 
<ul> 
<li> <b>Boardwalk To Go</b>, Boardwalk Inn. BTG serves many quick foods like 
corn dogs and chicken sandwiches, but one of its tastiest items is the cheese 
and/or chili fries. You can get a basket of<b>cheese fries</b> for $4.00. The 
<b>chili fries</b> are also $4.00. <b>Chili <i>and</i> cheese fries</b> are 
$4.50. It makes for a great afternoon or evening snack.</li> 
<li> <b>Captain Cook's</b>, Polynesian Resort. One of the Polynesian's 
specialties is<b>Tonga Toast</b>&mdash;a deep fried and battered breakfast dish 
made from sourdough bread, sprinkled with cinnamon and sugar, and stuffed with 
bananas. It's available at the Kona Caf&eacute; for $10.99, served with 
strawberry compote and your choice of ham, bacon, or sausage. However, for 
those of you on a budget, you can also get Tonga Toast at Captain Cook's food 
court for only $5.09. If that's not to your liking, try the adult breakfast 
platter for just $6.29, which has more than enough food to share with others.
</li> 
<li> <b>Mara</b>, Animal Kingdom Lodge. One of the resort's most unique and 
popular desserts is the<b>Zebra Domes</b>. They are a layer of yellow cake 
topped with mocha-chocolate mouse, covered in white chocolate ganache and 
painted over with milk chocolate ganache stripes to resemble a zebra. They are 
originally made and served in Boma, the resort's buffet restaurant. However, 
guests on the go can buy a four-pack at Mara for $3.69 during lunch and dinner.
</li> 
<li> <b>Market Street Food Court</b>, Caribbean Beach Resort. One of this food 
court's specialties is the<b>rotisserie chicken</b> in the Bridgetown Broiler 
section. It's only served at dinner and comes with your choice of two sides.
</li> 
<li> <b>Roaring Fork</b>, Wilderness Lodge. Don't miss this food court's <b>
brownies</b>. Each $3.29 brownie is frosted and cut in squares roughly four 
inches wide and half an inch thick, making them well worth the price. They're 
quite hefty, so be careful when picking one up. You might need to use both 
hands!</li> 
<li> <b>Sassagoula Floatworks and Food Factory</b>, Port Orleans-French Quarter
. One of the specialty foods here are the<b>beignets</b>, medium-sized fried 
French donuts covered in powdered sugar. They are part of the New Orleans 
culture and exclusively served at the Port Orleans Resort. You can buy three 
beignets for $2.99 or six for $4.29. They're tasty, but watch out for the 
sugar. It can get everywhere!</li> </ul> 
<h2>[edit][add listing] Drink</h2> 
<p>Once upon a time, <b>Pleasure Island</b> was a hot and happening nightspot, 
right on Disney property&mdash;and after a certain hour you knew there'd be no 
kids around. Today, Pleasure Island's nightclubs are but a memory, but that 
doesn't mean adults can't have some grown-up fun after dark.</p> 
<p>Certainly <b>Downtown Disney</b> is still a vibrant and active place at 
night. Several of the restaurants there, especially in Pleasure Island and on 
the West Side, have full-service bars;<b>Raglan Road</b> in particular is 
really more an Irish pub than a restaurant. And the DJ at<b>Bongos Cuban Cafe
</b> will keep you dancing throughout the evening. </p> 
<p>Despite the closures at Pleasure Island, don't think Walt Disney World is 
completely devoid of nightclubs these days. If you take a trip over to<b>
Disney's BoardWalk</b>, you'll find a modern dance club called <b>Atlantic 
Dance Hall</b> and a dueling-pianos bar called <b>Jellyrolls</b>. The rest of 
the BoardWalk also stays brightly lit until late at night, with sidewalk cafes, 
strolling magicians, and other quaint beach-style nightlife.</p> 
<p>Most of the resort hotels have their own lounges as well. While they're not 
exactly a good place to dance the night away, they do offer a more intimate, 
relaxed atmosphere and plenty of adult beverages. And if you just want to have 
a drink with dinner, most of the restaurants on property offer at least a few 
alcoholic options&mdash;though you won't find<i>any</i> in the Magic Kingdom. 
</p> 
<p>In Epcot, a popular stunt is called <b>Drinking Around the World</b>: have 
a drink in each of the countries of World Showcase. (Or, for a fun, free, and 
sober trip &quot;around the world&quot;, try a variety of international 
Coca-Cola products at<b>Club Cool</b> in the Innoventions pavilion.) </p> 
<ul> 
<li>There are a few things to keep in mind when purchasing alcohol at WDW: 
<ul> 
<li> There are <b>no alcoholic beverages</b> for sale in the Magic Kingdom. 
</li> 
<li> The <b>drinking age for alcohol</b> in Walt Disney World (and all of 
Florida, for that matter) is 21. Be prepared for strict enforcement of this 
rule; anybody caught drinking underage, even with parents, may be subject to 
ejection from the property and criminal prosecution.</li> 
<li> Be sure to <b>bring an actual I.D.</b> with you when purchasing 
beverages. Copies will not suffice.</li> 
<li> <b>No alcoholic beverages may be brought in</b> to any of the theme parks.
</li> 
<li> Alcoholic beverages may not be consumed outside of, or even removed from, 
their designated places of purchase (i.e., alcohol purchased in Disney's 
Hollywood Studios cannot leave the park). Alcohol purchased at selected gift 
shops (such as<i>Weinkeller</i> in Epcot's Germany pavilion in World Showcase) 
will be sealed in a gift box; if the box is opened, the purchase cannot be 
carried out of the park. As an alternative, the shop will have the package 
delivered to the front gate or to your on-site resort hotel free of charge, or 
you can arrange for shipping back home for a fee.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> 
<h2>[edit][add listing] Sleep</h2> This guide uses the following price ranges 
for a standard<i>double</i> room: <br>
<b>Budget</b>  Less than $150 <br>
<b>
Mid-range</b>  $150&ndash;$250 <br>
<b>Splurge</b>  $250 and up <br>
<br>

<p>One of the most important choices you must make when planning a Walt Disney 
World vacation is<b>whether to stay on-site</b> at one of the famed Disney 
resorts, or off-site at one of countless less expensive but more traditional 
hotels.</p> 
<p>For many visitors, a vital part of the Walt Disney World 
&quot;experience&quot; is staying at one of the 24 Disney-owned and -operated 
resorts.<i>Each and every one</i> of the Disney resorts is strongly themed, 
impeccably maintained, and a vacation experience all to itself. Although none 
of the resorts can really be called cheap&mdash;in fact, most of them are 
luxurious and priced accordingly&mdash;the least expensive resorts have rooms 
for as little as $82 a night in the off-season.</p> <br>
Perhaps the greatest 
perk of staying at Disney's Contemporary Resort is the monorail station located 
conveniently in the atrium. 
<ul> 
<li>There are a number of perks that are available only to Disney resort hotel 
guests:
<ul> 
<li>Free shuttle to and from Orlando International Airport with <b>Disney's 
Magical Express</b> </li> 
<li>Your <b>Key to the World card</b> serves as your room key, park ticket, 
and room-charge card all in one</li> 
<li><b>Extra Magic Hours</b> &ndash; Extra morning and evening hours at 
selected parks</li> 
<li>Free and convenient access to the parks via <b>Disney transportation</b>: 
motor coach, monorail, or water taxis</li> 
<li>Your hotel is only a quick trip away, allowing you to leave the parks when 
the crowds (or the sun) get to be too much and take a nap or go for a dip in 
one of the hotel pools</li> 
<li>Free parking at the parks if you choose to drive </li> 
<li>Guaranteed admission to the parks (during the busiest of peak times, a park
<i>may</i> (rarely) fill up and even guests with tickets may be turned away, 
but Disney resort guests will still be able to get in)</li> 
<li>Eligibility for the <b>Disney Dining Plan</b>, which can save money on 
dining throughout the property</li> 
<li>Ability to make advance dining reservations for your entire trip as early 
as 180 days before you arrive</li> 
<li>Disney Cast Members available to answer your questions </li> 
<li>Free <b>package delivery</b> from Disney-operated retail stores to your 
hotel</li> 
<li>Free taxi service to the golf courses, if you don't have your own car </li>
<li>Unique Disney-style resort entertainment and theming </li> </ul> </li> 
</ul> 
<p>On the other hand, staying off-property can have its own perks. Lodging and 
food costs are indisputably cheaper&mdash;often significantly so, with frequent 
discounts. You can book condos or home rentals for large groups, which allows 
you to cook meals making dining costs even cheaper and lodging costs very 
cheap. Many off-site resorts do have shuttle service to the Disney parks, 
although the service can be limited, potentially inconvenient, and may carry a 
fee.</p> 
<p>One possible compromise between the two approaches is to stay at the <b>
Walt Disney World Swan</b> or <b>Walt Disney World Dolphin</b>, which offer a 
more traditional hotel experience with most of the Disney resort benefits 
available. Another option is to stay at a hotel in the<b>Downtown Disney Hotel 
Plaza</b>; they're fairly generic and have few Disney amenities, but they're 
just across the street from Downtown Disney.</p>

<p>Disney has created an incredible variety of themed resorts over the years, 
each one offering a unique experience to guests, ranging from the basic 
services and colorful decor at the three All-Star resorts, to the opulence and 
luxury of the Disney's Grand Floridian Resort and Spa, to the rustic, wooded 
charm of Disney's Fort Wilderness Resort and Campground.</p> 
<p>Check-in time at Disney resorts is 3PM (4PM for the All-Star Resorts), and 
check-out time is 11AM&mdash;but don't fret if your flight schedule doesn't 
match up. You can do an<b>early check-in</b> starting at 8AM; leave your bags 
with bell services and they'll be delivered to your room when it's ready. 
You'll get your Key to the World card, so you can go enjoy the parks right 
away. Likewise at check-out; you can get into the parks all day on the day of 
your departure, so just leave your bags with bell services and pick them up 
before you leave for the airport.</p> 
<p>Please see each district's Sleep section for details on individual hotels. 
</p> 
<p>Please note that <i>all</i> Disney hotel rooms and other indoor areas are 
<b>100% smoke-free</b>. </p> 
<h4>[edit] Budget</h4> 
<p>Disney classifies their cheapest options as <b>Value resorts</b>. These 
resorts are great for guests with a limited budget, or for families with young 
kids on whom the sophisticated theming and amenities at the other resorts would 
be wasted. Prices (one room, two adults and two children) range from $82/night 
for a standard room in the value season to $160/night for a preferred room 
during Christmas week. There is a $10 fee for each adult beyond two per room.
</p> 
<p>The Value resorts have basic rooms with exterior entrances and minimal 
amenities. The theming is bold and colorful&mdash;kids<i>love</i> the 
larger-than-life decorations&mdash;but not particularly evocative of any 
particular environment. Hotel amenities include food courts and swimming pools, 
but no sit-down restaurants or other on-site recreation options.</p> 
<p>The Value resorts are <b>All-Star Movies</b>, <b>All-Star Sports</b>, and 
<b>All-Star Music</b> near Animal Kingdom; and <b>Art of Animation</b> and <b>
Pop Century</b> near Hollywood Studios. </p> 
<p>If you have a tent, camper, or motorhome, perhaps the best value on Disney 
property is at<b>Fort Wilderness</b> (near the Magic Kingdom), where you can 
rent a campsite for as little as $43 a night.</p> 
<h4>[edit] Mid-range</h4> 
<p>These are Disney's <b>Moderate resorts</b>. Guests who want the full Disney 
resort experience without paying for the extra luxuries and amenities at the 
Deluxe resorts will be more than satisfied by the Moderate resorts. Prices (one 
room, two adults and two children) range from $149/night for a standard room in 
the value season to $250/night for a preferred room during Christmas week. 
Prices can go even higher for the new pirate-themed rooms at Caribbean Beach 
and club-level rooms and suites at Coronado Springs. There is a $15 fee for 
each adult beyond two per room.</p> 
<p>The Moderate resorts have basic rooms with exterior entrances. The theming 
is straightforward but fun and evocative of the appropriate time and place, 
from the Louisiana bayou at Port Orleans-Riverside to the warm Caribbean colors 
of the Caribbean Beach. Hotel amenities include food courts, sit-down 
restaurants (usually), limited room service, swimming pools with extras (such 
as a slide), and some on-site recreation activities.</p> 
<p>The Moderate resorts are <b>Caribbean Beach</b> near Hollywood Studios; <b>
Port Orleans-Riverside</b> and <b>Port Orleans-French Quarter</b> near Downtown 
Disney; and <b>Coronado Springs</b> near Animal Kingdom. </p> 
<h4>[edit] Splurge</h4> 
<p>Disney's Deluxe resorts and the Deluxe villas fall into this category, the 
largest by far.</p> 
<h5>[edit] Deluxe resorts</h5> 
<p>The <b>Deluxe resorts</b> are for guests who want the ultimate in Disney 
hospitality, with luxury-hotel amenities and signature Disney experiences. 
Prices in this category vary widely. Some basic rooms can be had for as little 
as $240 a night in the value season, but more commonly start at $355/night and 
go up to $835 or more for the best single rooms. Luxurious suites are available 
at most of the resorts, starting at over $1,000/night and going up from there. 
There is a $25 fee for each adult beyond two per room.</p> 
<p>Deluxe resorts feature well-appointed rooms with interior entrances and 
extensive theming to match the resort. A Deluxe resort's decor is evocative and 
all-encompassing, with as much attention paid to detail as at any of the Disney 
theme parks. Hotel amenities include multiple full-service and casual 
restaurants, often with character dining; full room service; extensive pool and 
beach facilities with plenty of extras; numerous on-site recreation activities; 
and valet parking.</p> 
<p>The Deluxe resorts are the <b>Contemporary</b>, the <b>Wilderness Lodge</b>
, the<b>Polynesian</b>, and the <b>Grand Floridian</b> near the Magic Kingdom; 
the<b>Boardwalk Inn</b>, the <b>Yacht Club</b>, and the <b>Beach Club</b> near 
Epcot, and the <b>Animal Kingdom Lodge</b> near Animal Kingdom. </p> 
<p>The rental cabins at <b>Fort Wilderness</b> (near the Magic Kingdom) have 
full kitchens, plumbing, and maid service. They sleep six for $265&ndash;$410 a 
night.</p> 
<h5>[edit] Deluxe villas</h5> 
<p>The <b>Deluxe villas</b> were created to be part of the <b>Disney Vacation 
Club</b>, a time-share program created by Disney, but when DVC members aren't 
using them, they're open to the general public. The villas offer a more 
&quot;home-away-from-home&quot; feel, with studios and one-, two-, and even 
three-bedroom suites available. Prices range from $295/night for a studio at 
Old Key West or Saratoga Springs during the value season to $2,215/night for a 
three-bedroom Grand Villa at the Boardwalk or Beach Club Villas during 
Christmas week. If that price seems astonishing, consider that those villas 
sleep twelve people!</p> 
<p>Studios have a kitchenette; the suites have full kitchens, and the largest 
ones, Grand Villas, have full dining rooms. Most of the DVC resorts are 
attached to one of Disney's Deluxe resorts, sharing amenities with the 
&quot;parent&quot; resort; the others (Old Key West and Saratoga Springs) are 
standalone but have comparable amenities.</p> 
<p>The DVC resorts are <b>Bay Lake Tower at the Contemporary</b> and the <b>
Villas at the Wilderness Lodge</b> near the Magic Kingdom; the <b>Boardwalk 
Villas</b> and <b>Beach Club Villas</b> near Epcot; the <b>Animal Kingdom Villas
</b> near Animal Kingdom; and <b>Old Key West</b> and <b>Saratoga Springs</b> 
nearDowntown Disney. </p> 
<h3>[edit] Non-Disney resorts</h3> 
<p>This section covers only those resorts that are not owned/operated by 
Disney, but are located on Disney property.</p> 
<p>If you're going to stay off-property, there are scores of options, but be 
sure to research your selection well. Lots of hotels advertise themselves as 
being close to Walt Disney World, often with the word &quot;Maingate&quot; in 
their names, but they could be several miles away in reality. SeeLake Buena 
Vista and Kissimmee for off-property listings. </p> 
<h4>[edit] Budget</h4> 
<p>If you or a family member is an employee or retiree of the United States 
Department of Defense, including the military, you're in luck.<b>Shades of Green
</b>, near the Magic Kingdom has rooms starting at $93, depending on the 
employee's pay grade. Amenities are somewhat limited, though; see the full 
listing for details.</p> 
<p>For everyone else, affordable deals can be found at the <b>Downtown Disney 
Hotel Plaza</b> located adjacent to the Downtown Disney Marketplace. There are 
seven franchised or independent hotels in the Downtown Disney Hotel Plaza. 
Disney amenities are virtually nonexistent; only their proximity to Downtown 
Disney separates them from the other hotels inLake Buena Vista. Their prices 
are quite reasonable, though, considering their location.</p> 
<h4>[edit] Splurge</h4> 
<p>The <b>Walt Disney World Swan</b> and <b>Walt Disney World Dolphin</b>, 
located nearEpcot and not far from Hollywood Studios, have most of the 
amenities of Disney Resorts but are operated by Starwood Hotels, under the 
Westin and Sheraton banners (respectively). They are ideal for guests who want 
a more traditional hotel experience while still being right in the middle of 
Disney property. The whimsical exteriors are a sight to see all by themselves.
</p> 
<h2>[edit] Contact</h2> 
<p>Generally, visitors enjoy coming to Walt Disney World for a break from 
daily life, but that doesn't mean you want to be cut off completely.<b>Mail</b> 
can be dropped off at locations just inside each theme park's gates. Or, to 
really get into the spirit, drop your postcard in a real vintage mailbox on 
Main Street U.S.A.; cast members pick up such mail daily. Deluxe hotels might 
provide copies of the local<b>newspaper</b>, the <i>Orlando Sentinel</i>; ask 
at the front desk.</p> 
<p>After years of guest grumbling, <b>Internet access</b> has improved 
significantly. All resorts now offer<b>free Wi-Fi</b> in each guest room (free 
wired access at Fort Wilderness campsites) and in selected common areas. You 
can also find free Wi-Fi at the Wide World of Sports and a very few select 
locations around the parks.</p> 
<p>Other than that, just enjoy your respite from the world outside the World.

<h2>[edit] Stay safe</h2> <br>
Almost like being in Paris... almost 
<p>Walt Disney World is a very safe area, and the company spends a lot of time 
and money ensuring that it remains so. Still, it's wise to take common-sense 
precautions; even Disney can't account for every contingency. People have been 
victimized, injured, and even (very rarely) killed while visiting Walt Disney 
World, but there are plenty of steps you can take to minimize the chance of 
anything happening.</p> 
<h3>[edit] Security</h3> 
<ul> 
<li> Weapons of all sorts are prohibited in the parks; if you are carrying in 
a bag or backpack, a security officer will check its contents before you enter.
</li> 
<li> While theft is rare and security is always present throughout the resort, 
it's still a good idea to keep valuables locked in the electronic safe in your 
hotel room. Avoid bringing unnecessary items with you, and if you must, rent a 
locker and store them locked inside during your visit.</li> 
<li> Keep your eye on your belongings at all times. Do not display cash in 
public. Consider wearing a money belt. Do not leave anything in an unattended 
stroller or wheelchair, especially when you go on a ride. If possible, leave 
loose articles with a non-rider.</li> 
<li> Children are very safe at Walt Disney World, but it's not uncommon for 
parents and children to get separated due to the crowds. One suggestion is to 
write down your child's name with your name, resort, cell phone number, and any 
vital medical information on a 3x5 index card. Place the card in your child's 
pocket and instruct him/her to show the card to any Cast Member in the event 
that you get separated. Likewise, if you lose your child, notify a Cast Member 
immediately. They are all well trained and will get you reunited as quickly as 
possible. Some families also wear T-shirts with very bright, bold colors, 
making it less difficult to spot a member of your party in a sea of people.</li>
<li> If your child goes on a ride on his/her own, make sure you know where the 
ride's exit is. Arrange a place to meet with all members of your party if you 
become separated. Make the meeting place easy to find, but out of the way; 
areas such as in front of Cinderella Castle or the front of the park are likely 
to be too crowded to be useful.</li> </ul> 
<h3>[edit] Ride safety</h3> <br>

<p><b>WARNING</b>: Some attractions have <b>safety restrictions</b>. Children 
not meeting the minimum height requirement and pregnant women are not permitted 
to experience these attractions. Persons susceptible to motion sickness or 
having high blood pressure or heart, neck, or back problems should also avoid 
riding as these conditions are easily aggravated. Restraining devices may 
prevent persons of certain body shapes or sizes from riding.</p> <br>
<br>

<p> </p> 
<p>The above warning applies to the following attractions: </p> 
<dl> 
<dt> Magic Kingdom&nbsp; </dt> 
<dd> Space Mountain, Tomorrowland Speedway, Splash Mountain, Big Thunder 
Mountain Railroad</dd> 
<dt> Epcot&nbsp; </dt> 
<dd> Test Track, Mission: Space </dd> 
<dt> Hollywood Studios&nbsp; </dt> 
<dd> Star Tours, Rock 'n' Roller Coaster Starring Aerosmith, The Twilight Zone 
Tower of Terror</dd> 
<dt> Animal Kingdom&nbsp; </dt> 
<dd> Dinosaur, Kilimanjaro Safaris, Expedition Everest, Kali River Rapids, 
Primeval Whirl</dd> </dl> 
<p>Stitch's Great Escape in the Magic Kingdom has the same restrictions, 
except for the prohibition on pregnant women.</p> 
<p>If your child does not meet the ride's height requirement, there is a 
&quot;rider swap&quot; service available. This service enables one person to 
wait with the child while another goes on the ride; afterwards the person 
waiting with the child may board the ride without having to wait in line. Ask a 
Cast Member for more information.</p> 
<p>Also note that lap children are not permitted on most rides, especially if 
there are restraining devices.</p> 
<h3>[edit] Animal safety</h3> 
<ul> 
<li> With the exception of working service animals, pets are not permitted in 
the parks, Downtown Disney, transportation vehicles, or resorts. Designated 
areas of Disney's Fort Wilderness Campground<i>do</i> allow pets, specifically 
dogs, but those areas are limited.<b>Best Friends Pet Care</b> [26] operates a 
&quot;pet resort&quot; near the Port Orleans resorts, offering a variety of 
packages, including both day stays and overnight accommodations, with separate 
areas for dogs, cats, and &quot;pocket pets&quot; like hamsters.</li> 
<li><b>Do not leave your pet in your car.</b> It is against the law in 
Florida, as well as potentially fatal. The penalty is a $5,000 fine. A car with 
a pet locked inside<i>will</i> be broken into to remove the pet, and WDW will 
<i>not</i> be held liable for any damages incurred. </li> 
<li> Service animals may not be accommodated on some attractions. In that 
case, they must remain with a non-riding member of your party, as Cast Members 
are not authorized to handle service animals.</li> </ul> 
<h3>[edit] Assistance</h3> 
<ul> 
<li> If you have car trouble while in a theme park's parking lot, <b>raise 
your car's hood</b>, and someone will come to your assistance. </li> 
<li> Just like anywhere else in the USA, the emergency number throughout Walt 
Disney World is 911. Contacting this number will get you in touch with<b>Reedy 
Creek Emergency Services</b> [27], WDW's police, fire, and ambulance service. 
</li> 
<li> Minor <b>first aid</b> services are available free of charge at any park 
or resort and offer a quiet and cool place to rest:
<ul> 
<li>Magic Kingdom &mdash; next to the Crystal Palace, left around the central 
hub.</li> 
<li>Epcot &mdash; next to the baby center on the World Showcase side of the 
Odyssey Center.</li> 
<li>Hollywood Studios &mdash; at Guest Relations </li> 
<li>Animal Kingdom &mdash; in Discovery Island, next to Creature Comforts </li>
</ul> </li> 
<li>If an emergency need for prescription drugs occurs, <b>Turner Drugs</b> 
[28], +1 407-828-8125 at 1530 Celebration Blvd Suite 105-A will deliver the 
medication. They also will deliver OTC items and pick-up many items they do not 
stock and deliver them, as well. Most WDW hotels will pay for the delivery and 
charge the guest's room. There are also several Walgreens locations nearby.</li>
<li>There are two full-service medical facilities just outside the property 
lines:
<ul> 
<li><b>Celebration Health</b>, 400 Celebration Pl, +1 407-303-4000, [29]. 
Located at the intersection of I-4, US-192, and FL-417.</li> 
<li><b>CentraCare</b>, 12500 S Apopka Vineland Rd, +1 407 934-2273, [30]. 
Located adjacent to the Downtown Disney Hotel Plaza.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> 
<h3>[edit] Weather</h3> 
<p>Especially during the spring and summer, heat is the most likely 
weather-related issue you'll encounter.</p> 
<ul> 
<li>To cope: 
<ul> 
<li> Wear a light-colored shirt during the summer. <b>White and light colors
</b> reflect sunlight better than darker colors, so you won't get overheated as 
easily. Wear a hat and sunglasses to protect your head, face and eyes. 
Sunscreen may be purchased at most gift shops, but are often sold exorbitantly 
overpriced, so it may be easier on your wallet to bring your own.</li> 
<li> <b>Drink lots of water.</b> You can easily become dehydrated in the heat. 
Stay clear of carbonated drinks, tea and coffee. Dehydration can lead to 
weakness, fatigue, and eventually heat stroke due to the body's reduced ability 
to regulate its temperature.</li> 
<li> Go back to your hotel in the afternoon for a <b>dip in the pool</b> to 
cool you off. Or cool off in the one of the many interactive fountains that can 
be found in the parks. (Don't forget to take spare clothing with you!) Another 
good idea would be to visit Blizzard Beach or Typhoon Lagoon in the morning, 
then head to the theme parks afterwards; this will give your body adequate 
hydration to better withstand the heat.</li> 
<li> <b>Go indoors</b>, into an air-conditioned shop or attraction. Try to do 
the outdoor attractions in the morning, and save the indoor attractions and 
shows until the afternoon when it's hotter.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> 
<p>If your trip is in the late summer or early fall, you'll soon learn about 
the<b>daily afternoon thundershowers</b>. They are usually brief and won't ruin 
your whole day. If you want to stay dry, rain ponchos and umbrellas are sold 
throughout the parks. Walt Disney World does not close down due to rain, though 
some outdoor rides and attractions may temporarily do so.</p> 
<p><b>Hurricanes</b>, though, are a different story. The Orlando area is as 
far from the coasts as anyplace in the state, so hurricane-related closures are 
very rare. If the parks do end up closed for high winds, though, your resort 
hotel will make sure you stay entertained, sometimes with special appearances 
from the Disney characters. The hotels are perfectly safe in high winds.</p> 
<h2>[edit] Cope</h2> <br>
Sometimes you just want to relax on the beach 
<p>There's a way to get just about anything you might need while at Walt 
Disney World, although some may be more convenient than others.</p> 
<p>All resorts have coin-operated laundry facilities, daily maid service, and 
at least one shop selling basic essentials and sundries.</p> 
<p>Most of the resorts have exercise facilities; at the value resorts, though, 
you'll have to be content with just using a jogging path or swimming in the 
pool. Deluxe resorts will have more extensive &quot;health club&quot; 
facilities&mdash;in particular, the Grand Floridian's health club, attached to 
the spa, is quite spacious.</p> 
<p>If you find yourself in need of a haircut, there are a number of options. 
Most interesting is the Harmony Barber Shop on Main Street U.S.A. in the Magic 
Kingdom; first haircuts are their specialty, but anyone can walk in for a trim. 
The Contemporary Resort, Coronado Springs, the Grand Floridian, and the Yacht 
and Beach Clubs also have hair salons.</p> 
<h3>[edit] Child care</h3> 
<p>Sometimes, parents want to spend some time for themselves at Walt Disney 
World, be it going to a fancy dinner, enjoying some alcoholic beverages, or 
even sneaking another ride on Space Mountain without the kids tagging along. 
Parents of teenagers can just set them loose in a theme park and trust they'll 
be all right, but younger kids require more supervision.</p> 
<p>What's a parent to do? There are a number of options. </p> 
<p>Several of the resorts offer safe and secure <b>Children's Activity Centers
</b>, and you don't have to be staying at the resort to take advantage of them! 
The Centers are open daily from 4:30PM until midnight, and are well staffed by 
trained and certified child care personnel. Children must be potty trained and 
be between the ages of 4 and 12 (inclusive). The cost is $11.50 per hour per 
child, with a two-hour minimum; dinner is included if the kids are there 
between 6PM and 8PM. Your children will enjoy so many games, crafts, and 
activities that they won't even care you're off having fun without them. Of 
course, you'll be given a pager in case there's an emergency, and you can call 
at any time to check up on your kid.</p> 
<ul> 
<li>The Children's Activity Centers include: 
<ul> 
<li><b>Cub's Den</b>, Wilderness Lodge </li> 
<li><b>The Mouseketeer Club</b>, Grand Floridian Resort </li> 
<li><b>The Neverland Club</b>, Polynesian Resort </li> 
<li><b>Sandcastle Club</b>, Yacht and Beach Club Resorts (WDW resort guests 
only)</li> 
<li><b>Simba's Clubhouse</b>, Animal Kingdom Lodge </li> </ul> </li> </ul> 
<p>If your kids are too young for the activity centers, or you want to stay 
out past their bedtime, you can get<b>in-room babysitting</b>. WDW recommends 
<b>Kid's Nite Out</b> [31], +1-800-696-8105, but other equally reliable 
services operate in the area as well. Some, including Kid's Nite Out, offer 
24/7 service. Rates run about $12&ndash;$25 an hour, depending on time and 
number of children.</p> 
<h2>[edit] Get out</h2> 
<p><b>Avoid I-4</b> </p>
<p>In some cases, it may be a good idea to avoid Interstate 4 and instead use 
Turkey Lake Road, a surface street that parallels I-4 to the west, to travel 
from Walt Disney World to SeaWorld and Universal. This strategy can easily save 
you time, fuel, and aggravation.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can also take LYNX Route 50 to SeaWorld from the 
Transportation and Ticket Center or Downtown Disney Westside.</p>
<p>It is also possible to get to Universal via the LYNX system, but it 
involves making transfers. Take Route 50 to SeaWorld and transfer to Route 8 
which will take you to Wet 'n Wild, at the intersection of International Drive 
and Universal Boulevard. Here you can either transfer to Route 37 or walk about 
15 minutes to get to Universal.</p>
<p><b>Mears Transportation</b> [32] provides round-trip shuttle service to 
Busch Gardens from various locations in the Orlando area. The fare is $10 per 
person, or free with the Orlando Flex Ticket Plus. Note that you are 
responsible for your own transportation to/from the pickup point.</p> <br>
<br>

<p>Walt Disney World lies at the heart of an <b>archetypal Floridian paradise
</b>, with enough attractions and activities outside of Disney property to fill 
a good-sized book. You'll need to arrange some sort of transportation&mdash;be 
it rental car, municipal bus, or one of the many area shuttle services (see 
infobox)&mdash;to get to these other attractions, but they are certainly worth 
a look if you have the time, or if you just want to get away from Disney for a 
while.</p> 
<p>If you are planning to visit the other Orlando theme parks, you might want 
to consider getting the<b>Orlando Flex Ticket</b> [33] ($265), which is valid 
for 14 consecutive days beginning with the first use, and gives unlimited 
admission to Universal Orlando Resort (both parks), SeaWorld Orlando, and their 
water parks; or the<b>Orlando Flex Ticket Plus</b> ($304), which covers 
Universal, SeaWorld, and Busch Gardens, and also includes a free round trip 
shuttle bus to Busch Gardens from Orlando.</p> 
<p>For a broader spectrum of entertainment options, the <b>Go Orlando Card</b> 
[34] is available in increments of 1, 2, 3, 5, or 7 days and gives free 
admission and express entry to a number of attractions in and around Orlando 
and Kissimmee. Unfortunately, Walt Disney World, SeaWorld, and Universal are<i>
not</i> included in the Go Orlando Card. The complete list of attractions where 
it is accepted may be found here[35]. </p> 
<h3>[edit] To Orlando...</h3> 
<p><b>International Drive</b> [36] is Orlando's dynamic tourist corridor. With 
a multitude of attractions, dining, and shopping, it makes for the perfect side 
trip. Here you can also find Orlando's two other world-famous theme parks:</p> 
<ul> 
<li> SeaWorld Orlando, 7007 SeaWorld Dr (I-4 at SR 528), &#9742; 
+1-888-800-5447, [37]. See Shamu and his friends perform the most fascinating 
animal shows ever. Also, cool off at the sister water park<b>Aquatica</b> [38], 
or swim with the dolphins at<b>Discovery Cove</b> [39]. Admission to Discovery 
Cove is limited to 1,000 people a day, and reservations are an absolute must. 
$42-$280. &nbsp;edit </li> 
<li> Universal Orlando Resort, 6000 Universal Blvd (I-4 to Exit 74B or 75A), 
&#9742; +1 407-363-8000, [40]. Features <b>Universal Studios Florida</b>, <b>
Islands of Adventure</b>, and <b>CityWalk</b>. If the heat becomes unbearable, 
take a break between the parks at<b>Wet 'n Wild Orlando</b> [41], just a short 
drive, bus ride, or walk south. And the perfect way to wrap up your visit to 
Universal is by watching a performance of the<b>Blue Man Group</b> [42]. 
$74-$104. &nbsp;edit </li> </ul> 
<h3>[edit] ...and beyond</h3> 
<p>It's not just about Orlando, either; Central Florida is packed with 
attractions from coast to coast.</p> 
<ul> 
<li> Tampa (<i>I-4 west to I-75</i>) &mdash; Theme park enthusiasts will come 
to Tampa for<b>Busch Gardens</b> [43], but there's plenty else to do and see in 
Florida's third most populous city, including Buccaneers football, Rays 
baseball, and Lightning hockey.</li> 
<li> Clermont (<i>I-4 to US 192 to US 27 N</i>) &mdash; Check out one of the 
oldest central Florida landmarks, the<b>Citrus Tower</b> [44]. Completed in 
1956, this 226-foot observation tower still stands tall over former orange 
groves.</li> 
<li> Daytona Beach (<i>I-4 east to I-95</i>) &mdash; Home to NASCAR's most 
legendary racetrack. The<b>Daytona 500 Experience</b> is billed as &quot;The 
Official Attraction of NASCAR&quot;, a must for car-racing fans.</li> 
<li> Cape Canaveral (<i>I-4 east to SR 528</i>) &mdash; While countless cruise 
ships dock at Port Canaveral just to the north, the Cape is most well known for 
the<b>Kennedy Space Center</b> [45], where American astronauts have been 
launching into space since the 1960s. There's a museum on the history of space 
exploration, two IMAX theatres, and tour buses to the (otherwise restricted) 
launch facility.</li> </ul> 
<p> </p> <b>Routes through Walt Disney World</b> <br>
<br>
<b>Tampa</b> &larr; 
Davenport &larr;  &nbsp;<b>W</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>E</b>&nbsp;  &rarr; Lake Buena 
Vista &rarr; <b>Orlando</b> <br>

<p><b>The best of both worlds</b> </p>
<p>Yes, there are many similarities between Walt Disney World and the original 
Disneyland in California, as well as the other Disneylands around the world. 
But don't assume that if you've seen one, you've seen them all; on the whole, 
they are more different than they are alike. A few examples:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>The original Disneyland is the only one that has the &quot;Matterhorn 
Bobsleds&quot; attraction.</li> 
<li>Tokyo DisneySea, Tokyo Disneyland's sister park, is a widely acclaimed 
ocean-themed park exclusive to Japan.</li> 
<li>Walt Disney Studios Paris, Disneyland Paris' sister park, has an <i>
Armageddon</i> special effects walkthrough attraction and a <i>Finding Nemo</i> 
roller coaster.</li> 
<li>Hong Kong Disneyland has a <i>Toy Story</i> theme land and soon will also 
add two more unique themed lands: Grizzly Trail and Mystic Point.</li> </ul>

<p><b>Disney Premier Passport</b> </p>
<p>Visiting both Walt Disney World and the Disneyland Resort in the same year

the Passport gets you unlimited admission for a year to all eight theme and 
water parks in both Florida and California, plus DisneyQuest, ESPN Wide World 
of Sports, and the Oak Trail Golf Course. The Passport may be purchased at any 
Guest Relations location.</p> <br>
