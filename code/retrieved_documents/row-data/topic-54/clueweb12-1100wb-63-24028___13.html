<h1> What People Say About UK Whitegoods </h1> 
<p>We have never seen the need to blow our own trumpet all that much, we 
prefer to allow our service to speak for itself but we have been asked to 
publish some of the comments that we receive and keep on our wall. We don't 
edit them, we don't' correct grammar or spelling, this is just what people have 
told us.</p> 
<p>We are very, very proud of the services and standards or care that we offer 
and we strive to offer the best experience possible. As you can see from the 
comments here, many people agree that our services are outstanding.<br>
<br>
 
Of course we can't print them all, well we could but we don't want to get 
big-headed and put our competition to shame.</p>

<em>I just 
wanted to say how impressed I am with this site! I asked a question as to 
whether the fridge hinges I'd seen on your site were suitable for my fridge and 
got a very quick response. Then when I ordered the parts they were delivered 
less than 24 hours later - now that is good service, well done!<br>

 Many thanks for order safely received yesterday. Really impressed 
with your fast service - fridge door now has its new hinges installed. I was 
fearful we'd have to buy a new fridge...<br>

 I just wanted to let 
you know how much we appreciated your service. We live in the U.S., but our 
house has an old, French range that no one here would touch. If it hadn't been 
for your company, we would have had to buy a whole new range. We're thrilled to 
have just the part we needed to fix it ourselves!<br>

 Hi just would like to 
say a very big thank you for your advice on my broken dishwasher. The part that 
was advised was ordered on Tuesday morning, it flew to my house within 24 hours 
and I am delighted to report that my husband fitted the NTC tonight and we are 
all up and running.<br>
<br>
 I will definitely recommend your excellent 
website to all my friends and family whenever their needs arise and I have 
added your site to my favourites list!<br>

 Dear Dave, <br>
<br>
 Our 
warmest congratulations on a superb service from the Whitegoods operation.<br>

<br> Yesterday I enquired about an oven fan for a 7-year old Neff U1721 oven by 
web contact, just after which the fan died permanently. I phoned whitegoods 
mid-afternoon and got you, ordered the fan and was told it was not in stock but 
expected by the weekend. You told me to expect it early next week. In rural 
Scotland, I made that by late next week. My wife resigned herself to 
toast-based meals for the intervening period.<br>
<br>
 To our astonishment it 
arrived this morning. We did the replacement work together. The old fan came 
off easily after it was heated (priceless, the forum tips), the case eased out, 
#$%# , then an hour to pop into town and collect a T-15 Torx bit for the rear 
cover/motor screws. No screws were seized so it was a trouble-free replacement 
job. While the back was off I stuck a piece of damping foam onto the mount 
plate for the lower oven cooling fan (which has rattled since new). Back in 
place, a test run revealed a perfect fan performance and a rattle-free cooling 
fan operation. My wife thinks you're wonderful. We still had toast for tea.<br>

<br> Brilliant web site and functional business operation, a dream from a 
customer's perspective. Don't change a thing!<br>
<br>
 Very impressed thanks,
<br> John <br>
<br>

 Dear Dave, Happy 
New Year and thank you for your prompt reply. I have ordered the oven seal. 
Regarding the thermostat - I have bought an oven thermometer and find that both 
ovens do reach the heat they are set for so I think it's just me! However thank 
you again for your excellent customer service. I will not hesitate to use your 
company again and recommend you to friends. God bless, Mrs Mary<br>

 I just wanted to let you know that I found a contractor in 
Northern Ireland, Marc Williams (Profix) through your site, who came to my 
house, priced the job, came back with the parts and fixed my broken oven. Did a 
really professional job and for a very reasonable price.<br>
<br>
 Would you 
think about putting a feedback form on your site up front for customers to 
provide feedback on. I run an online business and my customers find this very 
useful.<br>

 Just a quick email to 
thank you for your excellent website and for the fast delivery of our cooker 
spare part. We had been without our oven for 4 months (due to not knowing any 
reputable repair companies and cost implications of getting someone in to fix 
it), but thanks to the advice on your website and your parts shop, we have 
managed to replace the element and now have a fully functioning oven! I will

 Thanks for the quick reply 
regarding the mains suppressor for my dishwasher (diplomat ADP 8242).<br>
 I 
have placed the order via the paypal link, and included the delivery address in 
the &quot;message to seller&quot; field as requested. Once again, thanks for 
the response from yourself, and the guys in the forum on UK whitegoods.<br>
 
Regards<br>
