<p><i><b>What's the latest Mansion-related news? </b></i></p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>I'm not a news service, but as I learn stuff, I post it - and usually to my 
Twitter feed or updates blog. </p> 
<p>As of summer, 2010, Disney and writer-director Guillermo del Toro have 
announced a collaboration on a new Haunted Mansion film. Stay tuned for more 
information.</p> 
<p>Their were several Haunted Mansion 40th Anniversary merchandise events 
planned for Disneyland in 2009. Learn more about these events and others at

<p><i><b>Hey, isn't there another Mansion FAQ out there somewhere? </b></i></p>
<blockquote> 
<p>Yes. It's by Don Bertino, and you can look at it here. It's a great 
document, but it's somewhat outdated (1996), and doesn't cover a lot of topics 
we thought people would like to know about.</p> 
<p>It covers quite a bit about the technologies used in the Disneyland 
Mansion, the people who created the magic that is the Mansion, and the text 
associated with the Mansion. There's a full script of the Disneyland attraction 
plus tomb inscriptions from the Anaheim Mansion's exterior.</p> </blockquote> 
<p><i><b>What's changed since the original FAQ was written? What are some of 
the most recent changes at the Mansions?</b></i></p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>One major Disneyland Mansion change we think bears special attention is the 
abandonment of Madame Leota's famous fiberoptic head effect. With Haunted 
Mansion Holiday in 2001, we saw the return of the 'front projection' effect 
onto a static table. Then in January of 2005, the whole Seance Scene was 
significantly revamped AGAIN to incorporate new &quot;hover&quot; technology 
and effects. The Haunted Mansion Holiday Leota (as of this writing) still 
utilizes a static projection effect, however.</p> 
<p>At the same time, the changing portrait gallery was altered. April December 
was removed, the Gorgon was swapped into her slot, and the &quot;Master 
Gracey&quot; changing portrait from the Walt Disney World Mansion Foyer was 
given the center frame. The portraits were &quot;repainted&quot; to utilize a 
new projection technique, and the slow-dissolve transformations were abandoned 
for the original lightening-cued flash transformations that opened the 
attraction (although, it's important to note that Marc Davis had, during the 
early imagineering stages of the effect, envisioned slow dissolves).</p> 
<p>In 2006, the attic scene was changed. The &quot;I do!&quot;popups were 
removed, the bride figure was completely changed out and moved to the opposite 
side of the Doombuggy track, and a new &quot;story&quot; introduced. The old 
jilted bride concept morphed into that of a golddigging, murderous &quot;black 
widow&quot; named Constance (ha) who marries men of means and then beheads 
them. The phantom pianist is still present, but the rest of the attic is now 
filled with vignettes including Constance's marriage portraits (as you pass, 
the grooms' heads disappear a la the original Hatbox Ghost that was originally 
located in the attic) along with the items she's amassed through each 
particular marriage. Constance herself is a roofer's-axe-wielding projection of 
a real actress (Julia Lee) on a dressed form, located on the left side of the 
Doombuggy track just before you exit to the graveyard. She's voiced by actress 
Kathryn Cressida, saying silly things like, &quot;I do...I<em>DID</em>...&quot; 
</p> 
<p>As of 2008, it appears that the &quot;original&quot; Ghost Host narration 
is back. No, nothing's been readded. However, the bit after the &quot;Shhhhh, 
listen&quot; about Madame Leota isn't there anymore. According toDon's FAQ, it 
was added with the 1995 refurb (during which the phantom pianist in the attic 
joined the cast of 999). When the Mansion reopened after the Haunted Mansion 
Holiday pulldown, it was gone again.</p> 
<p>Significant upgrades to the Walt Disney World Haunted Mansion are complete 
as of September 14, 2007. Changes include upgrades to attraction audio, a new 
changing portrait gallery just past load, the removal of the Sinister Eleven 
gallery (a dark corridor with evil eyes replaces the old gallery location), a 
New staircase scene just beyond the library and music room, the Disneyland 
&quot;floating&quot; Crystal Ball effect, the Disneyland &quot;Constance&quot; 
upgrades to the attic, a Mr. Toad tribute in the hillside pet cemetery, and 
more. According to my friend Bruce, the Marc Davis &quot;April&quot; portrait 
was added to one of the hall scenes several months after the reopening. I 
haven't seen it, so I can't verify precisely where it is (and he can't remember 
- ha!).</p> </blockquote>

</p> </blockquote> 
<p><i><b>What is the Haunted Mansion?</b></i> </p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>The Haunted Mansion is the Walt Disney Company's version of a classic 
&quot;Spook House&quot;. The first Haunted Mansion opened in Disneyland on 
August 9th, 1969, and each Disney theme park has included one ever since 
(except Hong Kong Disneyland, which opened in 2005 without a Mansion).</p> 
<p>The Walt Disney World version, which is nearly 33% longer than the 
Disneyland Mansion, opened in the Magic Kingdom's Liberty Square area on 
October 1st, 1971. Completed as early as Spring of 1971, it was among the 
opening day attractions.</p> 
<p>Tokyo Disneyland, which opened on April 15th, 1983, has a Mansion virtually 
identical to Walt Disney World's original Mansion. The Tokyo version is located 
in Fantasyland.</p> 
<p>On April 12th, 1992, Disneyland Paris opened its Phantom Manor, a new spin 
on the Haunted Mansion, located in Frontierland. Though its ride vehicle track 
and room layout is identical to those of the Disneyland Haunted Mansion, this 
haunted attraction involves western-themed story elements, special effects, and 
musical arrangements very unlike those used in the Mansions.</p> </blockquote> 
<p><b><i>Do you walk through the Haunted Mansion or is it a ride?</i></b> </p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>Both, actually. There is a brief &quot;pre-show&quot; walk through, 
consisting of two rooms (a Foyer and the &quot;Stretching Room&quot;) and a 
corridor. The bulk of the attraction is a slow-moving ride through the Mansion, 
with a running narration (courtesy of your friendly &quot;Ghost Host,&quot; a 
disembodied voice provided in the American Mansions by the late Paul Frees. 
Disneyland's Haunted Mansion Holiday host is voiced by Corey Burton).</p> 
</blockquote> 
<p><b><i>What is a &quot;Doombuggy&quot;?</i></b> </p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>The Haunted Mansion ride vehicles are called &quot;Doombuggies&quot; (a pun 
on the word &quot;dunebuggy&quot; that was, admittedly, a lot funnier in the 
late 1960s). They're black vehicles that are essentially a bench with an 
attached clamshell-shaped backdrop and a lap bar that closes around you (you 
can see a photograph of the Doombuggies below). Each Doombuggy has three 
speakers mounted inside the clamshell that provide a running narration through 
the attraction. Each Doombuggy can seat two adults or three children 
comfortably. The Doombuggies run on a continuous loop, with loading and 
unloading accomplished by use of a moving sidewalk/load belt.</p> 
<p>Doombuggies, also known as Omnimovers, were originally developed for use in 
&quot;Adventures Thru Inner Space,&quot; a former Disneyland Tomorrowland 
attraction about atomic science, featuring a trip through a snowflake molecule. 
The attraction went in with Disneyland's New Tomorrowland in 1967, and was 
replaced with Star Tours in 1986. However, its legacy lives on in the Haunted 
Mansions, &quot;Buzz Lightyear's Space Ranger Spin&quot; and a few EPCOT 
attractions, all of which use the Omnimover vehicle system. The Omnimover 
vehicle design was conceived by Bob Gurr and a few other Disney Imagineers, and 
then brought to fruition by the Arrow Dynamics company, which has provided a 
number of ride vehicles and systems to the Disney Parks since 1955.</p> 
<p></p> </blockquote> 
<p><b><i>Is it scary/suitable for my children?</i></b> </p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>That depends entirely upon you and your children. Some sensitive adults 
find the attraction scary, while most think the scares and subject matter are 
rather tame. Children tend to be more frightened by the idea of the Haunted 
Mansion than by the ride itself. According to the WDW Official Website, the 
Haunted Mansion &quot;may be too intense for children and some adults.&quot;</p>
<p>While there is virtually no gore in the Haunted Mansion, there are 
supernatural and occult themes and scenes (including a seance) that some 
members of certain religions or sects may find offensive. Some portions of the 
attraction are rather dimly-lit, and...</p> </blockquote> 
<p><b><i>Does anything grab you or jump out at you?</i></b> </p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>Nothing will grab, splash, or touch you in the Haunted Mansion. During the 
Graveyard scenes, there are several &quot;pop-up&quot; ghosts that have been 
known to momentarily startle even diehard fans of the attraction with dozens, 
if not hundreds, of visits under their belts (including the authors of this 
FAQ).</p> </blockquote> 
<p><b><i>Are there any physical restrictions?</i></b> </p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>Not really, as the Haunted Mansion is not a thrill ride. For 
mobility-impaired guests, the Haunted Mansion is &quot;transfer 
accessible&quot; (meaning you will need to be transferred from your wheelchair 
to the ride vehicle in order to experience the attraction). This can be 
accomplished very easily if you can walk for short distances (20 feet or so). 
If you can't walk at all, you will need the assistance of a friend or family 
member (the ride attendants are not permitted to lift guests for safety 
reasons). If necessary, the attraction can be stopped in order to allow 
mobility-impaired guests to board. The ride portion of the attraction moves 
very slowly, and tilts backwards at one point. While the ride cars can rotate a 
full 360 degrees, they do not spin wildly.</p> </blockquote> 
<p><b><i>What can't I do inside?</i></b> </p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>As in virtually all Disney attractions, guests are asked to refrain from 
eating, drinking, smoking, taking flash pictures, or using video cameras with 
an attached spotlight. The reasons for the first two are simple: it cuts down 
on the potential for messes and spills. Smoking is potentially dangerous; in 
addition to the smell and the health risks to other guests, some structures and 
mechanisms in the Haunted Mansion could be damaged by a smoldering cigarette 
butt or hot ash. The other two create a nuisance for other guests, and may ruin 
or spoil many of the illusions inside the attraction. Videotaping without an 
external light (or with an infrared light) is permitted. Once you board your 
Doombuggy, DO NOT ATTEMPT TO EXIT THE VEHICLE UNTIL A CAST MEMBER GIVES YOU THE 
GO-AHEAD. Doing otherwise could result in serious bodily injury and/or 
expulsion from the park. Finally, while not a ride requirement, you should 
cover or extinguish all lighted jewelry or toys, as the glow from these items 
may disturb other guests and detract from the ride experience. Also, for the 
love of Gracey's Ghost, please don't spiel along.</p> </blockquote> 
<p><b><i>What happens if I or my children &quot;chicken out&quot;?</i></b> </p>
<blockquote> 
<p>If you decide not to ride the attraction after entering, please notify a 
Cast Member immediately. There are &quot;Chicken Exits&quot; available that 
will bypass the ride completely and send you immediately to the exit (At WDW, 
the exit is marked with a sign reading &quot;For those of you too full of fear, 
one last chance to exit here&quot;). Once you board your Doombuggy, you will 
not be permitted to exit the ride until it comes to an end.</p> 
<p></p> </blockquote> 
<p><b><i>How long is the ride itself?</i></b> </p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>At WDW, the ride portion of the Haunted Mansion is roughly 7 to 8 minutes 
long. When combined with the pre-show, the total length of the average guest's 
experience is roughly 15 minutes (not counting the queue line, of course). At 
Disneyland, the combined length is a little bit shorter.</p> </blockquote> 
<p><b><i>What are all of the tombstone epitaphs?</i></b> </p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>You can find a list of Disneyland's epitaphs on Don's FAQ. </p> 
<p>Originally, the Disneyland Mansion featured an exterior *human* cemetery 
with a collection of imagineer headstones similar to those listed below. The 
epitaphs were composed by show writer X. Atencio, while the tombstones 
themselves were designed by Vic Greene.</p> 
<p>Sometime later, a small &quot;pet cemetery&quot; was fashioned atop the 
main exit crypt right next to the disability-accessible entrance on the side of 
the building (don't confuse it with the much newer, main queue pet cemetery, 
which was added much later). It's still there, and includes a sparse assortment 
of pet gravestones created from backyard statuary (check our &quot;graveyards
&quot; section for pictures).</p> 
<p>At some point in the 1970s, the imagineer cemetery - which had been located 
within the queue area on the French Market side of the Mansion facade building 
- was cleared to make room for more queue space. At right, you can see where 
the headstones sat, in front of the mausoleum/chicken exit door. This screencap 
was taken from the March, 1970 &quot;Disneyland Showtime&quot; special 
featuring the Osmonds, EJ Peaker, Kurt Russell, and the Haunted Mansion. In 
this scene, Peter Bruni (as Mr. Gridley) is desperately searching for Donnie 
and Jay Osmond.</p> 
<p>At least one imagineer - X. Atencio - took &quot;his&quot; headstone home 
after the queue space enlargement. Some of the remaining headstones were 
relocated to the top of the berm next to the queue area (the Good Old Fred one 
I remember being up there for certain). Sometime not long before the advent of 
Haunted Mansion Holiday, however, the remainders were cleared away for good.</p>
<p>In 1993, the &quot;new&quot; pet cemetery was added to the main queue area. 
</p> 
<p>At the Walt Disney World mansion, the imagineer epitaphs are (with the 
imagineer's real name and general Mansion project role in brackets]:<br>

<blockquote> 
<p>A pet cemetery resembling the first &quot;exit crypt pet cemetery&quot; at 
Disneyland was added at WDW's mansion sometime after the &quot;new&quot; pet 
cemetery was added at Disneyland in 1993. It's located on the sloping hillside 
between the Mansion exit crypt and the gate entrance to the Mansion's main 
exterior queue areas. In addition to the monuments inspired by the original 
Disneyland pet cemetery (the first version, not the 90s addition), it contains 
a tribute to Mr. Toad (added with or just after the big 2007 refurb).<br>
<br>

Inside the Haunted Mansions, many of the graveyard scene headstones supposedly 
feature scrambled references to various imagineers who worked on the 
attraction. At Disneyland, you'll find a 21st century addition to the interior 
graveyard scene. It was purchased via a Disney AuctionEars Ebay stunt by a 
Louisiana attorney (&quot;Jay&quot;). It stands to the left of the Doombuggy 
track as you pass the spooky musicians. :)</p> </blockquote> 
<p><b><i>In the &quot;Stretching Gallery&quot;, does the ceiling go up, or 
does the floor go down?</i></b> </p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>Depends on where you are! At Disneyland, the Stretching Room is a true 
elevator, carrying guests down to a lower level (they need to be moved under 
the railroad tracks to a show building outside the park's berm). At Walt Disney 
World and Tokyo Disneyland, it isn't necessary to move the guests to a lower 
level, so the ceiling rises up.</p> </blockquote> 
<p><b><i>Is there any significance to the Hearse outside the Haunted Mansion?
</i></b> </p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>No. </p> 
<p>Both Disneyland and Walt Disney World display an antique hearse outside the 
Mansion (Disneyland's is painted white, while Walt Disney World's is painted 
black). Disneyland's hearse appeared first, with the big attraction refurb of 
1995.</p> 
<p>While the hearses are authentic antique funeral carriages that were used in 
funeral ceremonies, neither has any special significance as far as we know. In 
his Mansion book, however, Jason Surrell provides that the black hearse at WDW 
was used in at least one film,<em>The Sons of Katie Elder</em>. </p> 
<p>For the record: It has been widely reported that Disneyland's hearse was 
used in the 1877 funeral of Mormon leader Brigham Young, but this has been 
hotly disputed by some Mormons and historians. Some antique hearse experts have 
also disputed the claims, maintaining that Disneyland&#146;s hearse is an 1890s 
model, and thus could not have been used.</p> 
<p>Walt Disney World's hearse was manufactured in the 1860s, and the 
compartment inside that hearse contains a floral arrangement of ferns and 
roses. The compartment inside Disneyland's hearse contains a sign stating 
Disneyland's &quot;Ghost Relations&quot; department is &quot;Accepting 
Applications.&quot;</p> </blockquote> 
<p><b><i>Is there a story behind the Mansion?</i></b> </p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>Yes and no. </p> 
<p>As it wound up ultimately presented, the Haunted Mansion is merely a 
haunted house pastiche - a collection of ghostly gags and clich&eacute;s 
without a storyline. That wasn't the original intention, however, and it isn't 
the way&nbsp;Disneyland Paris' Phantom Manor came to be presented, either.</p> 
<p>Walt Disney had always wanted some sort of haunted attraction in his park, 
though he didn't have any set ideas in mind when he began toying with the 
concept in the early 1950s. According to some, the original inspirations for 
this &quot;spooky house&quot; concept were a pair of Bob Hope ghost flicks (<em>
The Cat and the Canary</em> and <em>The Ghost Breakers</em>). </p> 
<p>The first artistic rendering of a Disney haunted attraction was created by 
Harper Goff in 1951. His generic &quot;haunted house&quot; drawing featured a 
street scene intended for Disneyland's precursor project - the so-called 
&quot;Mickey Mouse Park&quot; that would have been built on a smallish parcel 
of land across the street from the Walt Disney Studios in Burbank.</p> 
<p>With the construction of Disneyland in 1955, the Haunted House project 
started to take on a bit more life. According to imagineer and Mansion author 
Jason Surrell, art director Marvin Davis included a Haunted House in early 
visual conceptions of Main Street USA. Slated to become a walk-through tour 
guided by cast members, this latest incarnation of Walt's haunted attraction 
would have been situated in one of the &quot;Center Street&quot; cul-de-sacs 
located in the middle of Main Street.</p> 
<p>Ken Anderson, when assigned primary artistic responsibility for the project 
in 1957, went out in search of further inspiration for Walt's spook house, 
touring Sarah Winchester's amazing 1880's farmhouse-cum-sprawling mansion in 
San Jose, California. The Winchester House (Llanada Villa) is the source of the 
Mansion's Endless Hallway concept, various decor elements (including the dark, 
wood molding), and the notion of putting a big pipe organ in a crazy little 
ballroom.</p> 
<p>Eventually, it was agreed that the &quot;Haunted House&quot; (as it was 
marked on maps of the park from 1957) would be constructed in what would become 
the New Orleans Square section of Disneyland. In 1962, the Mansion facade was 
built along the Rivers of America, in what was at the time the farthest edge of 
Frontierland. Built just next to Magnolia Park and Fowler's Harbor, the 
building remained empty and quiet until 1968. In 1963, WED erected a sign 
outside the building, inviting various happy haunts to move in. Martin Sklar, 
current WDI Ambassador and former Imagineering principal creative executive, 
wrote the copy featured on the sign (for the record, the sign as constructed 
was different than the blueprint concept featuredhere on the site - the sign 
copy differs, too. My blueprint, given the 1969 date, was a concept for a much 
later addition). The 1963 Sklar sign text read:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p><em>Notice!<br>
 All Ghosts<br>
 And Restless Spirits</em></p> 
<p><em>Past-lifetime leases are<br>
 now available in this</em></p> 
<p><em>HAUNTED<br>
 MANSION</em></p> 
<p><em>don't be left out in the sunshine! Enjoy active retirement in this 
country club atmosphere - the fashionable address for famous ghosts, ghosts 
trying to make a name for themselves...and ghosts afraid to live by themselves! 
Leases include License to scare the daylights out of guests visiting the 
Portrait Gallery, Museum of the Supernatural, graveyard, and other happy 
haunting grounds. for reservations send resume of past experience to:</em></p> 
<p><em>Ghost Relations Dept. Disneyland. Please! Do not apply in person. </em>
</p> </blockquote> 
<p>Story concepts revolved around various characters. With Ken Anderson's 
assignment to the project in 1957, the team considered using the prankish 
spirits from the classic 1937 animated short film &quot;Lonesome Ghosts&quot; 
and other supernatural Disney cartoon personalities. According to comprehensive 
blueprints created by Anderson, this incarnation would have combined the 
original &quot;walk through tour&quot; idea with a theatre-type finale 
featuring dark-ride style special effects. It would have featured the Headless 
Horseman from Disney's adaptation of &quot;The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,&quot; a 
story playing prominently in 1949's two-part cartoon feature &quot;The 
Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad.&quot;</p> 
<p>Eventually, they developed new stories about original characters, such as 
the murderous &quot;Blood family&quot;, or Pirate Captain Gore (also known as 
&quot;Bloodmere&quot; in some versions) and his doomed bride, Priscilla. Cast 
members portraying family servants would serve as the tour guides, an idea 
which survives today in the maid/butler roles that contemporary Mansion hosts 
and hostesses play. Vestiges of the Pirate Groom/Doomed Bride story remain in 
the Disneyland Mansion to this day, too, from the &quot;lonely&quot; bride in 
the attic (with the 2006 conversion of the usual bride to the murderous 
&quot;Constance,&quot; this isn't necessarily the case anymore) to the 
ship-shaped weathervane atop the Captain's Walk.&nbsp; Incidentally, nearly 30 
years later, the tragic wedding story concept was resurrected in the planning 
and construction of Disneyland Paris' Phantom Manor (opening in 1992), which 
roughly tells the story of a beautiful girl named Melanie Ravenswood, whose 
groom is murdered by the evil Phantom, who in turn makes her his captive.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Various gags and elements researched for the attraction in the 
early-to-mid-sixties included Rolly Crump's &quot;Museum of the 
Supernatural&quot; (also known in some proposals as the &quot;Museum of the 
Weird&quot;), featuring a candle man, a living gypsy cart, a talking chair, and 
a coffin clock. Marc Davis' famous changing portraits and stretching pictures, 
too, were in the mix as early as 1965, when Walt showed them off in the 
Disneyland Tencennial episode of<em>Wonderful World of Color</em>. While the 
Museum of the Supernatural never made the finished attraction intact (the 
corridor of doors wallpaper, chair-faces, and haunted grandfather clocks are 
among the remnants), several of Marc Davis' supernatural portraits certainly 
did (most notably in the Disneyland Mansion's changing portrait hall and in the 
WDW Mansion's now-defunct Sinister Eleven gallery).</p> 
<p>Before the Mansion attraction could be fully planned and executed, however, 
WED Enterprises - what Disney Imagineering was then called - became distracted 
by their work on the 1964-65 New York World's Fair. As a result, most of the 
Mansion planning was delayed until after the Fair was over. But there were 
other projects still to be finished before the Mansion could become a top 
priority. New Orleans Square and Pirates of the Caribbean had to be put to bed 
first. Walt Disney's death in December of 1966 and 1967's New Tomorrowland 
project further complicated matters. Still, the wait wasn't a total waste of 
time, as the development of the Omnimover ride vehicle system for New 
Tomorrowland's Adventure Thru Inner Space would provide a solution to two 
problems. The walk-through concept limited guest capacity, for one, and made it 
impossible to present high-quality special effect viewpoints for guests at the 
back and sides of each tourgroup, too. Omnimovers, on the other hand, offered 
guests a high-quality, uniform attraction experience at speedy intervals.</p> 
<p>By a happy combination of circumstances, the reluctant 'spook house' on the 
river which Walt and WED Enterprises so desperately wanted to populate finally 
became a workable concept as the Doombuggy-powered Haunted Mansion. As the 
first major Disneyland attraction to be completed without Walt's close 
direction, some people believe that the Haunted Mansion is an example of failed 
Imagineering teamwork. They cite the ambiance-and-design-heavy first half of 
the attraction (care of Claude Coates) and the character-jammed second half 
(care of Marc Davis) as the misintegration of Imagineering talents and 
personalities, while others believe it to be a clever and intentional means of 
building up and then smashing to bits the scary-old-house clich&eacute;. The 
Haunted Mansion is a tremendous joke on the guest, really - when you first get 
in the queue, you have no idea what you're in for. As you proceed through the 
attraction, you suspect you're in for some sort of scare...a scare which turns 
out to be less frightening than silly and amusing.</p> </blockquote> 
<p>Will I see ghosts? Will they frighten me? </p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>Duh. You WILL see ghosts, and they will give you a start, but not in the 
straight, serious, horror-scare-you way you might expect. These are HAPPY 
Haunts who know how to have a good time.</p> </blockquote> 
<p>Are there exactly 999 ghosts/ghost effects in the mansions?</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>No. There are well under 999 actual ghost figures and effects in the 
mansion.</p> 
<p>The 999 happy haunts/room for a thousand thing is just a cute way of 
playing up Walt Disney's original &quot;supernatural real estate&quot; gag, 
conceived early in the planning stages of the project. In the 1950s, while 
visiting England, Walt publicly broke his plans for a haunted attraction in a 
BBC radio interview. He announced his intention to recruit old ghosts to come 
live and &quot;perform&quot; at Disneyland, claiming inspiration by all of the 
ancient ghosts displaced from old British homes during wartime and urban 
renewal. The &quot;spooky retirement community&quot; concept continued into the 
1960s with Marty Sklar's &quot;real estate sign&quot; copy (see above), and 
strongly influenced me in developing the &quot;home and garden&quot; spoof 
slant for this web site.</p> 
<p>If you're serious about your numbers, WDI Senior Creative Veep Tony Baxter 
suggests including the wallpaper demons from the Corridor of Doors in your 
count.</p> </blockquote> 
<p><b><i>I've heard Cast Members and fans referring to characters in the 
Mansions by name. Are all of the characters named?</i></b> </p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>Only Madame Leota, the disembodied spirit medium, and now Constance the 
black widow are officially named in the Haunted Mansion universe. Some 
characters - including the hanging skeleton and the singing busts - had 
in-house Imagineering names which have influenced the monikers by which some 
Mansion fans refer to them. The singing busts, for example, had names printed 
on the projection film used to bring them to life. So we guess that counts as 
official. Sort of.</p> 
<p>Phantom Manor's Ravenswood family were all given official names in the 
backstory developed for the Thunder Mesa area. According to Jason Surrell, even 
Melanie Ravenswood's first name is &quot;official.&quot;</p> 
<p>I've also heard Tony Baxter refer to the &quot;ghost horse&quot; attached 
to the WDW exterior hearse as &quot;Old Dobbin.&quot; Since Mr. Baxter approved 
the original hearse addition to Disneyland's Mansion exterior in 1995, and came 
up with the idea of including ghost horses with the hearses in the first place, 
I suppose he should be the one to name them.</p> 
<p>As for the rest of the names you may hear or read, they're largely made up. 
In the late 1980s / early 1990s, some Walt Disney World cast members decided to 
name many of the Mansion's characters, providing background stories for them as 
well (the now-infamous &quot;Ghostly Gallery&quot;). Many of these names are 
rooted in tombstone and mausoleum epitaphs found on the Mansion grounds, though 
these epitaph names are not officially linked with any particular ghost 
characters featured inside the attractions.</p> 
<p>Other fans (including the co-author of this FAQ, AprilDecember) came up 
with names and stories for other characters, including someunique to the 
Disneyland Mansion. </p> 
<p>None of these are official, and some fans and Cast Members (including 
Disney Archivist Dave Smith) refuse to recognize or acknowledge them.</p> 
<p>In fact, given that in 2005 the Disneyland changing portrait gallery was 
significantly changed (with the addition of the &quot;Gracey&quot; foyer 
portrait from the WDW Mansion, the removal of AprilDecember, and the 
transformation of the Panther gal into a...white tiger, I guess?), you might 
say that some of the Disneyland portrait gallery stories (and WDW Sinister 
Eleven biographies, given the 2007 WDW refurb) are left more than a little 
rootless nowadays. Also, given the 2006 changes in the Disneyland Mansion's 
attic in particular, the &quot;helpless little bride&quot; traditions carried 
over from the original Mansion story concepts - through the American and Tokyo 
Mansions, and STRONGLY into Phantom Manor - have been somewhat...negated. Bleh. 
And yes, yes...I know that the Haunted Mansion movie altered the nature of the 
bride story as it is. But now that the Disneyland and WDW brides are<em>
eeeeevillle</em>... </p> </blockquote> 
<p><b><i>What happened to the changing portraits in the Disneyland mansion?</i>
</b> </p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>They completely redid the effect in January of 2005, probably to bring a 
little more &quot;Gracey&quot; into the Disneyland Mansion, to bring the 
presentation a bit more in line with both zee Movieeee et le WDW Mansion.</p> 
<p>Originally, the portraits were intended to fade back and forth between the 
before and after pictures (according to Marc Davis, who had originally prepared 
them for a Mansion-themed restaurant that never materialized). For some reason, 
the imagineers at WED changed the concept before installation. So, for many 
years, the portraits changed with every flash of lightening which illuminated 
the hallway. Then, in the big 1995 mansion refurb, they portraits were made to 
fade slowly, as originally intended. In '05, the effect was completely changed 
AGAIN. Now, the portraits flash back and forth with the lightning again. This 
time, though, the technology has been significantly revamped. The portraits are 
made to look less like projection screens, and more like paintings. To make the 
new effect more workable, the panther lady portrait has been essentially 
recolored; her hair seems to be lighter, and her gown is now black instead of 
white. Additionally, the gorgon's been moved to AprilDecember's place on the 
far end of the hall, and the foyer painting of 'Master Gracey' from the WDW 
mansion is now in the center frame.</p> 
<p>Yes. April's gone. Visually, at least. And I'm miffed. Although, I've heard 
that the Marc Davis April is now hanging somewhere in the WDW Mansion. She 
doesn't &quot;change&quot; though.</p> </blockquote> 
<p><b><i>Are the mansion exteriors based on real houses?</i></b> </p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>Yes! The Disneyland fa&ccedil;ade is probably based on several real 
structures. Stanton Hall in Natchez, Mississippi, theEvergreen House in 
Maryland, and another Baltimore mansion, theShipley-Lydecker House, all bear 
similarities to the final Mansion exterior. Imagineers (notably Ken Anderson, 
to whom Walt Disney assigned primary artistic responsibility for &quot;Haunted 
House&quot; concepts in 1957) actually visited Evergreen House to collect 
details. The other Baltimore source structure was depicted in an architectural 
resource collection used at WED (you can see the photo of the house at
DoomBuggies.com). Interior and initial concept details for the attraction (like 
the endless hallway) were gleaned during at least one visit by Anderson to 
Sarah Winchester'sLlanada Villa in San Jose, California. </p> 
<p>The Walt Disney World and Tokyo Disneyland fa&ccedil;ades incorporate 
elements of several different periods. They're partially influenced by the 
Harry Packer Mansion in Jim Thorpe, Pennsylvania, and by a drawing or engraving 
of a stone villa from an architecture collection used at WED. Finally, despite 
Disney's claims that it's based primarily on an old &quot;Second Empire&quot; 
style schoolhouse (theFourth Ward School in Virginia City, Nevada), Phantom 
Manor's fa&ccedil;ade in Disneyland Paris appears to be heavily influenced by 
the infamous &quot;Bates House&quot; from Alfred Hitchcock's classic horror 
thriller &quot;Psycho&quot;.<br>

<p><b><i>When is the best time to ride the Mansion?</i></b> </p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>The Haunted Mansion is an attraction blessed with relatively short queues 
and generally speedy loads. It's also got interesting queue areas and a 
pre-show which is a vital part of the Haunted Mansion experience, which makes 
the wait to get on the &quot;ride&quot; less of a bore. On most days at the 
park, you won't have to wait more than 15-20 minutes to get in. Unless it's 
Christmas Break, Spring Break, or the peak of summer, wait times should be 
moderate-to-nil. On busy park days, early morning and late night are probably 
the best times to try the Mansion.</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p><b><i>Special Note:</i></b><i> With the introduction of the Haunted Mansion 
Holiday overlay at Disneyland, queue waits from October to the beginning of 
January may be significantly lengthened. Now that the furor's died down a bit, 
you will likely not run into too many queue problems on weekdays; but, watch 
out on weekends, holidays (like Thanksgiving week), and throughout Christmas 
break.</i></p> 
<p><i>Also be aware that the overlay prep will make extended refurbishment 
downtime necessary (the week after labor day through the beginning of October, 
and the second week of January through the beginning of February).</i> <em>Now 
that Haunted Mansion Holiday is a regular event at Tokyo Disneyland as well, 
you should expect similar sticking points at that park during the holiday 
season, too.</em> </p> </blockquote> 
<p>At Disneyland, Fantasmic! shows on the Rivers of America will usually make 
access to the whole of New Orleans Square and Critter Country very difficult, 
if not impossible, during the half-hour or so before, during, and just after 
the performance. However, wait times for the Haunted Mansion will usually be 
pretty short if you can get through the crowds. One way to avoid pushing your 
way through the masses of Fantasmic! humanity is to take the Disneyland 
Railroad to New Orleans Square. The Mansion is right next door to the station.
</p> 
<p>At Walt Disney World, the Mansion is also all but deserted during the early 
morning and late in the evening (as crowds tend to pass up the Mansion in favor 
of the &quot;mountain&quot; thrill rides).&nbsp; In the afternoon, the crowds 
are much heavier as tourists use the cold, dark Mansion to escape the Florida 
sun.&nbsp; Also, the Mansion is pretty vacant immediately before and during the 
Magic Kingdom Parades, although Liberty Square becomes congested to the point 
of immobility during them. Your best bet to access the Mansion during a parade 
is through Fantasyland (as opposed to approaching Liberty Square through the 
Hub or Frontierland).&nbsp; Immediately after the parades, however, the Mansion 
is typically flooded by a &quot;rush&quot; of guests.</p> 
<p>Fastpass systems have been added to both the Disneyland and Walt Disney 
World Mansions, but are now rarely used (last I noticed, at Disneyland, 
FastPass only ran during Haunted Mansion Holiday crowds). On busy days in the 
park, using the Fastpass option may work for you. The idea behind Fastpass is 
this: you can 'reserve' yourself a spot in an attraction during a specific 
window of time, thereby reducing your time in line. Not everyone is convinced 
that Fastpass works to the guest's advantage, especially when used on an 
attraction with naturally short wait times like the Mansion. But hey, if it's 
there, give it a try. Disneyland's Mansion Fastpass distribution area is 
beautiful, especially at night. It's themed to look like part of the Mansion's 
gardens, and is worth a look, at least!&nbsp; The WDW Haunted Mansion's 
Fastpass area has been themed to look like a colonial shipping dock receiving 
shipments of fresh tombstones.</p> </blockquote> 
<p><b><i>Are there days when the Mansion will be closed?</i></b> </p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>Yes! The parks refurbish most attractions at least once a year, usually 
during off-peak weeks in the fall, late winter, and spring. In the past, the 
Haunted Mansion has been known to go down for scheduled maintenance in October, 
February, and April (and now for Haunted Mansion Holiday, the Disneyland 
Mansion is down in September and January...see the Haunted Mansion Holiday note 
above).&nbsp; The WDW Mansion was down for most of the summer of 2007 in order 
to accomplish its first major-change rehab in time for the first Mickey's 
Not-So-Scary Hallowe'en party in late September. In general, &quot;rehab&quot; 
periods usually last anywhere from a few days to a few months, depending on the 
kinds of repairs and additions planned for the attraction.</p> 
<p>Disneyland.com and WaltDisneyWorld.com try to post refurbishment schedules 
to their calendars features as soon as the schedules are known, but nothing's 
guaranteed. Sometimes, an attraction will go &quot;101&quot; - Disney codespeak 
for a breakdown - with no notice whatsoever.</p> </blockquote> 
<p><b><i>How can I get the music from the Haunted Mansion?</i></b> </p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>The music is available on Compact Disc.&nbsp; </p> 
<p>&quot;Grim Grinning Ghosts&quot; can be found on the <strong>Official Albums
</strong> of Disneyland and Walt Disney World.&nbsp; </p> 
<p><strong>Disneyland Forever</strong> Kiosks in Disneyland's 20th Century 
Music Shop (Main Street) and Premier Shop (Tomorrowland, next to the old NASA 
exhibit) used to have Haunted Mansion selections available as part of a 
&quot;build your own Disneyland CD&quot; offering. The pertinent tracks 
included the Foyer, Load, Ballroom Organ, Graveyard instrumental, and acapella 
Exit Crypt music with Little Leota's spiel. At the time of the latest FAQ 
update, the Disneyland Forever Kiosks have been discontinued. We have also 
learned that the WDW Forever Kiosks are also gone. You can still find 
&quot;used&quot; versions on Ebay. You can also find a torrent containing ALL 
of the Disneyland Forever selections in lossless formathere. </p> 
<p>Each park still sells the &quot;<strong>Haunted Mansion Compact Disc
</strong>&quot; (the same thing as the old 30th anniversary cd, 
basically).&nbsp; This CD includes the following tracks (text taken from the 
Album's liner notes):</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p><i>Track 1:&nbsp; Walt Disney&nbsp; 0:26</i> <br>
 In this 1965 clip from 
the &quot;Disneyland 10th Anniversary&quot; television program, Walt takes 
eager viewers behind-the-scenes to preview concepts for the Haunted Mansion, 
joined by Disney legend Marc Davis and the first Disneyland Ambassador, Julie 
Reihm.</p> 
<p><i>Track 2:&nbsp; Welcome&nbsp; 2:02</i> <br>
 A pair of unused 
introductions to the Mansion, performed by actress Eleanor Audley (Madame 
Leota) and brilliant voice talent Paul Frees (The Ghost Host.)</p> 
<p><i>Track 3:&nbsp; The Haunted Mansion at Disneyland&nbsp; 22:28</i> <br>
 
The original chills and thrills, from the first creaking threshold to the last 
groaning tombstone.&nbsp; Paul Frees &quot;etherealizes&quot; as our Ghost Host 
while Thurl Ravenscroft's distinctive bass voice resounds through the 
graveyard.&nbsp; Stay alert, though, this soundtrack assembly includes a few 
never-before-heard surprises.</p> 
<p><i>Track 4:&nbsp; The Haunted Mansion at Walt Disney World&nbsp; 1:00</i> 
<br> When the Haunted Mansion materialized in 1971 in the Magic Kingdom at the 
Walt Disney World Resort, it was nearly identical to the Disneyland show, with 
the addition of these brief but eerie audio tracks - actually recorded at the 
same time as the Disneyland soundtrack.</p> 
<p><i>Track 5:&nbsp; The Haunted Mansion at Tokyo Disneyland&nbsp; 1:31</i> 
<br> When Tokyo Disneyland opened in April of 1983, the Haunted Mansion was 
there, towering over Fantasyland.&nbsp; The attraction was a duplicate of the 
Walt Disney World show - in English - except for a chilling narration delivered 
by a Japanese speaking Ghost Host (T. Hori).</p> 
<p><i>Track 6:&nbsp; Phantom Manor at Disneyland Paris&nbsp; 12:48</i> <br>
 
In 1990, Vincent Price recorded a narration for Phantom Manor - but the show 
concept changed and his narration was never used.&nbsp; Mr. Price's performance 
is heard here for the first time anywhere.&nbsp; The entrancing musical 
arrangements were created by John Debney.</p> 
<p><i>Track 7:&nbsp; The Genius of Paul Frees&nbsp; 4:01</i> <br>
 A 
collection of out-takes and unused narration from the original Haunted Mansion, 
providing a rare behind-the-scenes glimpse at the work of Paul Frees.&nbsp; The 
voice of Marc Davis can be heard in the background, as he and X. Atencio direct 
the recording sessions.</p> 
<p><i>Track 8:&nbsp; Otherworldly Music&nbsp; 3:32</i> <br>
 World-renowned 
organist Gaylord Carter performed these unheard versions of the Haunted Mansion 
music under the direction of composer and Disney Legend Buddy Baker.</p> 
<p><i>Track 9: Three Ghostly Voices&nbsp; 2:55</i> <br>
 &nbsp;First, Eleanor 
Audley, who voiced several Disney animated villains, awakens &quot;creepies and 
crawlies&quot; with these out-takes from her recording sessions as Madame Leota 
and the Raven.&nbsp; Next, veteran Disney character actor Pete Renoudet gives a 
supernaturally good audition performance as the Ghost Host.&nbsp; And third, 
Imagineer Leota Toombs (who appeared as both the face of Madame Leota and the 
face and voice of Little Leota) is heard in these never-before-released vocal 
takes for Madame Leota.</p> 
<p><i>Track 10:&nbsp; Spooky Sound Effects&nbsp; 4:48</i> <br>
 Here are some 
of the eerie music tracks and sound effects from the Haunted Mansion.&nbsp; 
Many of the sound effects were created by Disney Legend Jimmy MacDonald.</p> 
<p><i>Track 11:&nbsp; Original Radio Advertisements&nbsp; 2:55</i> <br>
 
Original radio advertisements in the summer of 1969 featured Lennie Weinrib as 
the Daring Reporter, Ginny Taylor as the Ghost Son, and Paul Frees recreating 
his role as the Ghost Host, as well as playing the parts of Phineas Pock, 
Willie the Wisp, and Granny Ghoul.</p> 
<p><i>Track 12:&nbsp; Breakdown and Unload Spiels&nbsp; 0:55</i> <br>
 The 
show's writer, X. Atencio, provided his own voice for the foreboding 
&quot;breakdown&quot; spiels and some &quot;unload&quot; spiels that never 
materialized.</p> </blockquote>

<p>The music box version of Grim Grinning Ghosts that plays when I load the 
Better Haunts main page - where's it from?</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>It was originally created for the gazebo in the outer queue area of Phantom 
Manor at Disneyland Paris. Now you can hear it in the Mansion FastPass area at 
Disneyland (or at least, you could last I checked). You used to hear it as part 
of the queue background music loop during Haunted Mansion Holiday 2001. They 
now use the Scarols in the queue.</p> </blockquote> 
<p><b><i>Are there any good books or shows I can find about the Haunted 
Mansion?</i></b></p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>We are happy to report that the Mansion book selection is deepening. You 
can order a copy of<i>The Haunted Mansion: From the Magic Kingdom to the Movies
</i> - by Jason Surrell - from Amazon.com. </p> 
<p>It's an excellent resource for all Mansion fans!</p> 
<p>There's also a series of Haunted Mansion comics presented by Slave Labor 
Graphics, a children's popup book (now out of print), a few movie-related kids' 
books, several coloring books, and small sections covering the Mansion in 
various books about the parks/Walt Disney/Imagineering, among other things.</p> 
<p>Some of your best information bets are probably the two best-known 
unofficial Disney historical journals,<i>Persistence of Vision</i> and <i>The E 
Ticket</i> (no longer publishing).</p> 
<p><i>POV</i>'s Issue #9 dedicates several pages to the music of the Haunted 
Mansions. It's a must-have issue.</p> 
<p>The two most notable Mansion-related editions of <i>The E Ticket</i> are 
available onCD-ROM...</p> 
<ul> 
<li><b>Issue #13</b> - Summer 1992. Snow White dark ride, and interview with

<p>You'll also want to check out The October, 2002, issues of <i>Haunted 
Attraction</i> magazine. Several of the articles (including one by co-FAQ 
author AprilDecember) are availablehere.</p> 
<p>The Haunted Mansion gets airtime in many television shows and specials, 
almost all of them Disney. The trick is finding the ones with significant 
content. AprilDecember recommends two:</p> 
<p>A 1970 Disney television special called <i>Disneyland Showtime</i> is 
particularly interesting. Sometimes, it airs late-night on the Disney channel 
(with the discontinuation of<i>Vault Disney</i>, though, who knows when or if 
it'll continue to run). Kurt Russell, the Osmonds, EJ Peaker, and friends take 
viewers on an abbreviated ridethrough of the attraction. In addition, Russell 
narrates a segment on the making of the Mansion, which features some nifty 
shots of Imagineers working on effects and models for the attraction.</p> 
<p>Another good tv offering is the 1965 &quot;Disneyland Tencennial&quot; 
episode of Disney's<i>Wonderful World of Color</i> series, originally presented 
on NBC and currently available on DVD (order it above). In it, we're introduced 
to Marc Davis, Rolly Crump, and several concept artworks and models created for 
the Mansion. If you want to see what the Museum of the Weird was all about, see 
this show. If you want to see some changing portrait art that never made the 
cut, see this show.</p> 
<p>If you crave more, Jeff at Doombuggies.com has a large media collection 
including various scenes and snippets from tv specials and documentaries. 
Youtube.com is another good place to look.</p> </blockquote> 
<p><b><i>Are there any websites that have good information about the Haunted

<blockquote> 
<p>While there are more websites devoted to the Haunted Mansion than any other 
single Disney Attraction, we preferDoombuggies.com, GrimGhosts.com, Better 
Haunts &amp; Graveyards, and TombSweetTomb.com.&nbsp; Additionally, the best 
overall Phantom Manor website (in our humble opinions) isRavenswood Manor. If 
you have a site you like, email us about it! We can't guarantee we'll link it, 
though.</p> </blockquote>

<p><b><i>What is the 'Haunted Mansion' font called? Where can I get it?</i></b>
</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>Co-FAQ author Kronos and Justin Callahan created a wonderful version of the 
font called &quot;Ravenscroft.&quot; You can get it atDisney Fonts. Be sure to

<p><b><i>What kinds of special events has Disney done to celebrate the Haunted 
Mansion?</i></b> </p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>There have been many! </p> 
<p>Disneyland celebrated the 30th Anniversary of the Haunted Mansion on June 
26, 1999 with a special ticketed event.&nbsp; The event began with a panel 
discussion by HM Imagineers entitled &quot;The Haunted Mansion: 30 Years of Hot 
and Cold Running Chills&quot; and sales of collectible merchandise (including 
event-specific pins, CDs, t-shirts, artwork, figurines, posters and a leather 
jacket.&nbsp; Much of the merchandise sold out within hours, and as of this 
writing is fetching 2-10 times retail price among Disneyana collectors). The 
evening was capped off with a midnight ride through the Haunted Mansion where 
guests got to shake the hands of the Imagineers who worked on the attraction 
and thrill to &quot;real&quot; ghosts hidden throughout the ride.</p> 
<p>On October 25, 2000, the Disneyland Resort in California hosted a special 
&quot;Haunted Mansion&quot;-themed dinner experience for $2,000.00 a 
ticket.&nbsp; 30 lucky (and, one presumes, wealthy) guests were given the full 
VIP treatment as they were driven by limousine from the Disneyland Hotel 
through Disneyland to the front gate of the Mansion.&nbsp; As they walked to 
the Mansion, each guest noticed a new tombstone bearing his or her name (and a 
humorous custom epitaph) on the Mansion's lawn.&nbsp; They were greeted at the 
front door by none other than Jack Skellington (from the Disney/Touchstone film
<i>The Nightmare Before Christmas</i>) who led them to a sumptuous banquet held 
in the Changing Portrait Hallway. The guests dined on such fare as 
&quot;Mummified Duck&quot; and &quot;Death by Chocolate&quot; with Imagineers 
Rolly Crump and Alice Davis, while being serenaded with chamber music from a 
ghostly band of musicians.&nbsp; After dinner, guests were given a personalized 
Death Certificate and invited on a behind-the-scenes walking tour of the 
Haunted Mansion -- with the house lights on. After the tour, the guests boarded 
the Doombuggies for a ride through the Mansion -- this time with actors hidden 
throughout the attraction.&nbsp; Afterwards, they were chauffeured back to 
their hotel, where special souvenirs (including their personalized tombstone) 
awaited them.&nbsp; The next day the guests concluded their adventure with 
a&nbsp; luncheon held at the park's ultra-private, ultra-exclusive restaurant 
and lounge, Club 33.</p> 
<p>Over the 2001-2002 holiday season, Disneyland inaugurated &quot;Haunted 
Mansion Holiday,&quot; an attraction overlay based on Disney's<i>The Nightmare 
Before Christmas</i> (Click here for a transcript and more from the special 
2001 narration) with another special event. Both the event and the overlay were 
huge successes, sparking plans for similar overlays at other Mansion 
attractions (to date, Tokyo Disneyland's Mansion). In October of 2002, Haunted 
Mansion Holiday reprised itself with a different musical score. Another 
special-ticket price-tiered event was held, along with a great Disney Gallery 
exhibit on the art of the Haunted Mansion. More price-tiered Holiday events 
ocurred in 2003 and 2004.<strong>Apparently, there are no special Haunted 
Mansion Holiday merch/dinner events planned for Disneyland from 2006 on</strong>
.</p> 
<p>On October 30, 2002, Walt Disney World's Magic Kingdom held a special 
&quot;999 Happy Haunts Ball.&quot; It was reprised on October 27-29, 2003, and 
again in 2004.</p> 
<p>Another spooky event that is not directly Mansion-related is WDW's 
&quot;Mickey's Not-So-Scary Hallowe'en Party,&quot; held several days each 
October at the Magic Kingdom. This hard-ticket event includes 
trick-or-treating, special parades and fireworks, fortune telling, and more.</p>
<p>As of 2005, Disneyland has drummed up it's own version of the MNSSHP, 
called Mickey's Halloween Treat. This event is a hard-ticket event taking place 
on selected evenings during the Hallowe'en season at Disney's California 
Adventure.</p> 
<p>In 2006, Disneyland added an annual, resort-wide, season-long celebration 
called HalloweenTime, which means special decorations and daily events which 
can be joined apart from the hard-ticket MHT event...</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>The witching hour of midnight on Sept. 29, 2006, will mark the beginning of 
Disney's HalloweenTime, an all-new seasonal event at the Disneyland Resort with 
whimsical decor, costumed Disney Characters, and interactive Halloween 
activities the whole family will find frightfully fun. Continuing through Oct. 
31, the first-ever event will allow guests to enter a family-friendly world of 
Halloween delights. &quot;Disney's HalloweenTime will be a wonderful 
opportunity for families to come together and enjoy the make-believe aspects of 
the holiday,&quot; said Matt Ouimet, president of the Disneyland Resort. 
&quot;We hope families will begin a new holiday tradition of celebrating 
Halloween with us here at the Disneyland Resort.&quot;</p> </blockquote>

<p><b><i>Was the 2002 (and beyond) Haunted Mansion Holiday music different 
from 2001's original tunes?</i></b></p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>Yes. In 2001, the overlay featured a lovely score orchestrated by Gordy 
Goodwin. There were no Danny Elfman tunes from<i> Nightmare Before Christmas 
</i>in that soundtrack. In 2002, there was an entirely new soundtrack, 
featuring the Danny Elfman tunes from the film. Many folks who've heard both 
versions seem to prefer the Goodwin score, oddly enough. In fact, in the middle 
of the 2002 Haunted Mansion Holiday season, the expanding room soundtrack was 
reverted to the Goodwin version. That's how it's been ever since.</p> 
</blockquote> 
<p><b><i>When's the next big Haunted Mansion Event? When do I register?</i></b>
</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>Disneyland has several 40th anniversary-themed events planned for summer, 
2009. </p> 
<p>We recommend that you keep a close eye on the Disney Gallery site (I'm not 
sure what to call it now that the Disney Gallery has closed) and theDisney 
parks special merchandising events pages to see what's coming down the pipe. 
The latter listing is geared primarily to pin-trading, but it should include 
every event of interest, as virtually all events are merch-heavy, and merch 
means lots of pins (not to mention funky-expensive tschotsky-thingies that 
probably break really easily, tee hee).</p> 
<p>If you have already attended a special event, or have put yourself on the 
Disney Gallery/Disneyana shop mailing list, you'll probably get an invitation 
in the mail. Be advised, though, that these announcements sometimes arrive too 
late to reserve space. Additionally, the Disneyland and WDW mailing lists 
rarely overlap. So, if you're only on the Disneyland list, you probably won't 
get info about WDW events.</p> 
<p>As a last line of offense, pay attention to the popular Haunted Mansion fan 
lists and bulletin boards. Chances are that somebody lurking about will have 
gotten the info from one source or another, and usually well ahead of time. 
Keep in mind that sometimes company plans change, though, so don't take early 
rumors too seriously.</p> </blockquote> 
<p><b><i>What's this I hear about a Haunted Mansion movie?</i></b></p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>Which one? There's the 2003 film starring Eddie Murphy AND a new production 
that was announced in July of 2010.Disney will be collaborating with 
writer-director Guillermo del Toro on this new Haunted Mansion film. Stay tuned 
for more information.</p> 
<p>Here's more on the 2003 movie: </p> 
<p>Walt Disney Pictures presented a feature film based on the Haunted Mansion 
attraction at Disneyland. It was released on November 26, 2003 in theatres.</p>

<p><b><i>What kinds of Haunted Mansion souvenirs are available?</i></b> </p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>Since the Haunted Mansion Anniversary event mentioned above, Mansion fans 
have enjoyed a resurgence in Haunted Mansion collectibles. A special CD, 
T-shirts, beanbag toys, masks, lithographs, lenticular cards, sculptures, pins, 
and other items came to join the normal selection of attraction posters, 
Disneyland Forever CD selections, and postcards at Disneyland. More recently, 
special &quot;Haunted Mansion Holiday&quot; merch (pins, ornaments, 
sweatshirts, plush, &amp;c.) have made it to the shelves of New Orleans Square 
shops (including a cart near the Mansion exit, and a reincarnated store below 
the Disney Gallery called<b><i> Le Bat en Rouge</i></b>!). In 2002, the 
Disneyana and Disney Gallery shops even carried a version of the Haunted 
Mansion gate plaque. It included a sound chip which played a short snippet of 
Ghost Host narration.</p> 
<p>In recent years, Walt Disney World has also gotten into the Mansion 
merchandise &quot;spirit&quot; with Madame Leota's Cart, which has sold Mansion 
pop-up books, gargoyles, coloring books, and die-cast hearses (complete with 
invisible ghost horse!), and other items. Some of the more recent offerings at 
the cart include license plates, hats, baby tees, lockets, buttons, and fridge 
magnets. Many of these items feature the phrase &quot;It's Your Funeral!&quot; 
along with a gothling Mansion maid with black hair who holds a rose.</p> 
<p>DisneyShopping.com has gotten into the act as well, carrying Haunted 
Mansion collectibles, Hallowe'en Decorations, and more!</p> </blockquote> 
<p><b><i>So what about the Haunted Mansion Clue game?</i></b> </p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>It's quite pretty, coming in a colorful tin. It's also quite pricey, 
though. Kronos, a Clue enthusiast in addition to his Mansion affinity, has 
complained about the thinness of the playing pieces (they're not fully 
dimensionalized) and the omission of the side doors in the ballroom. This 
omission apparently hampers game strategy and renders the set useless at 
official Clue tournaments. You can buy it atour Astore. </p> </blockquote> 
<p><b><i>Can I purchase Haunted Mansion souvenirs outside the parks?</i></b> 
</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>Yes. DisneyShopping.com is one good place to start, though it does not 
usually feature the same items sold at the parks. Most Mansion items currently 
sold at the parks can be ordered through Disneyland DelivEARS (1-800-760-3566) 
or Walt Disney World Merchandise Mail Order (1-407-363-6200). Other options for 
new merchandise include MouseShoppe.com (for Disneyland items), which tends to 
be significantly more expensive, and eBay, an online auction outfit. A few 
words of warning about eBay: Unless you're bidding on an item presented by the 
Disney Company (ID: disneyauctionears), bid with caution. While many sellers 
offer bona fide merchandise at fair minimums, others have been known to 
misrepresent their wares. Some present home-made or counterfeit items as 
official merchandise, while others falsely claim that their items are 'rare' or 
'sold out.' That having been said...</p> </blockquote> 
<p><b><i>What about the older souvenirs that are no longer produced?</i></b> 
</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>For those who want vintage and other sold-out Haunted Mansion items, such 
as the 1969 story album narrated by Thurl Ravenscroft, the 1964 sound effects 
album, the secret panel chest, E-Ticket magazine back issues, and the like, 
eBay should not be missed. eBay is also the place to go if you really WANT wild 
and wacky unofficial stuff, like original artwork, gate plaque castings, 
etceteras. Bidding usually gets fierce on the most-wanted collectibles, but if 
you have to have it, chances are you'll be able to get it on eBay.</p> 
</blockquote> 
<p><b><i>Are there stores outside the parks that sell Mansion-related park 
souvenirs?</i></b> </p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>There are also a number of Disney Warehouse stores in California and 
Florida, which may have some Mansion items left over from Disneyland. Most of 
these stores aren't permanent. As far as we know, the Barstow and Anaheim 
locations in California, and the Character Warehouse in the former Belz Outlet 
Mall in Orlando, are the only fixed locations. At the Barstow location, FAQ 
co-author AprilDecember found her collection of Hitchhiking Ghost Beanies for 
less than six dollars!</p> 
<p>DisneyShopping.com (formerly The Disney Store) has also been known to sell 
Mansion-related items, though not usually the same items you see in the parks. 
During the 1998 and 1999 Hallowe'en seasons, it sold a cassette version of the 
1969 story album narrated by Thurl Ravenscroft. In 2002, a Mansion snowglobe 
and Mansion 'spookhouse' decoration were available (they were still carried at 
Disneyland's &quot;Le Bat en Rouge&quot; too, for awhile at least). Since, 
they've given us all sorts of Mansiony crap, from pins and other collectibles 
to Hallowe'en decorations. In 2006, I bought a light-up attic bride piece with 
a beating heart; she looked great with our jack-o-lanterns! :)</p> </blockquote>
