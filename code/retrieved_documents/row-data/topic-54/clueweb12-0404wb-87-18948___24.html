Audi's TT 3.2 quattro with DSG <br>
<br> 
<p> (QQ, Winter 2004) &mdash; The Audi steamroller maintains its advance. Not 
only does the motorsports juggernaut continue to lay waste to the competition, 
as evidenced by the recent ALMS and Speed Channel GT championships, but Audi AG 
continues to turn out top quality product, as evidenced by critically lauded 
automobiles like the RS6 and the S4. Enter Audi's latest handiwork, the TT 3.2 
quattro with Direct Shift Gearbox (DSG). The DSG is a transmission that 
delivers on the heretofore-unrealized promise of a manual gearbox that can also 
be operated in a true (read smooth) automatic mode. That's correct-a clutch 
pedal-less gearbox that manual tranny fans can finally embrace as opposed to 
the slew of &quot;xyz-tronic&quot; manu-matic transmissions that are parading 
around as something more than an automatic transmission-of which they are not, 
including Audi's own Tiptronic transmission.</p> 
<p>As a result of recent comparison test wins (Car and Driver May 2003, and 
Road and Track December 2003) the Audi brand continues its move towards the 
Premium and Progressive ends of the automotive spectrum (see Graphic). The 2004 
TT 3.2 contributes to this progression by reflecting all of Audi's brand 
characteristics: sportiness (powerful engines routed through quattro all wheel 
drive), sophistication (in design and execution), and progression (trendsetting 
technical achievements). This new TT features a 3.2-liter V6 (Audi shies away 
from the decidedly VW &quot;VR6&quot; moniker) with 250 horsepower at 6300 rpm 
and 236 pound feet of torque from 2800 to 3200 rpm. The aforementioned DSG 
transmission performs its duties extremely well in manual, automatic, and 
automatic + sport modes. As this TT is part of the S Line (newly introduced to 
North America) it visibly differentiates itself from its stable mates as a 
result of its bolder exterior package that includes more aggressive bodywork 
and S Line badging. Audi considers S Line vehicles stand-alone models as 
opposed to vehicles merely equipped with an option package.</p> 
<p>The TT 3.2's missions include: enriching the TT model range late in its 
lifecycle, showing Audi's increased level of V6 engine expertise, and 
introducing what was originally used only as a race car transmission in a 
serially produced passenger vehicle. A comparison of TT buyer demographics 
versus those of all sports car purchasers, shows that the TT enjoys more women 
buyers, and a higher instance of buyers with college degrees. In what has 
become an increasingly crowded market of coupes and two-seat roadsters Audi 
sees the BMW Z4, Chrysler Crossfire, Mercedes-Benz SLK, and Nissan 350Z as 
primary competitors. The TT 3.2 does climb in base price with an MSRP of 
$39,900 and $42,900 for the coupe and roadster, respectively.</p> 
<p>3.2 liter V6 motivation Audi's engineers have taken VW's latest iteration 
of the 15-degree, narrow-angle, VR6 motor and bumped displacement from 2.8 to 
3.2 liters by increasing bore and stroke commensurately. Additional 
modifications include changes to the intake tract, cylinder head and 
compression ratio. While fans of turbocharged motors will bemoan the lack of 
extreme tunability, this naturally aspirated V6 offers torque off the line, 
usable power in the lower rev-range and, hence, first class drivability. The 
run up to sixty miles per hour from a standing start takes 6.4 seconds (factory 
estimated and probably a bit conservative). Off the line, with the ESP switched 
off, the TT 3.2 will break traction and casually snap your head back.</p> 
<p>And the sound, especially top-down in the roadster-oh the sound! Audi 
provides yet another internal combustion concerto. Gone are the days of Audis 
so silent that a glance at the tachometer was required to verify the motor was 
running. Immediately upon startup, the exhaust barks loudly and then falls into 
a noticeable idle. Feed in the throttle and a conspicuous growl builds through 
the lower rev range. Open it up a bit and things actually quiet down. Outside 
of increasing wind noise, this is a direct result of a dual chamber muffler 
system similar to the operation in that of the B6 chassis S4. At lower revs the 
mufflers are essentially a &quot;straight-through&quot; design. At higher revs 
a vacuum actuated valve reroutes exhaust gases to reduce sound pressure levels 
at cruising speeds. At first, this may seem counterintuitive towards 
increasingly stringent European drive-by noise standards. But, in a nod towards 
the enthusiast, Audi has focused on the all important aural aspect of driving 
enjoyment.</p> 
<p>I found little to dislike with Audi's latest V6, it is smooth, offers good 
low-end torque, and makes great sounds. As enthusiasts, we can always use more 
power, but the most important aspect is not the motor, but rather what it is 
connected to-the belle of the ball-the DSG transmission.</p> 
<p>Vorsprung durch Technik at your fingertips Audi's Direct Shift Gearbox 
offers a quantum leap in transmission technology and it is the first sequential 
manual gearbox to deliver glass smooth semi-manual up-shifts, as well as, the 
more easily executed, perfect rev-matched downshifts. It is important to note 
that the DSG is a derivative of a manual gearbox, in that it is devoid of the 
power sapping torque converter or planetary gears that are associated with 
automatic transmissions. There are, however, two electro-hydraulic clutches 
handling two gears simultaneously. Audi's technical description is as follows: 
During operation, DSG engages one gear and pre-selects the next based on the 
approaching point of the next up- or downshift. When the shift process 
occurs-either automatically or by driver input via the shift lever or the 
racing style, steering-wheel mounted shift-paddles-the clutch of the engaged 
gear opens as the clutch of the next pre-selected gear closes. The gear change 
takes place under load, with a certain overlap, resulting in the continuous 
flow of power to the wheels.</p> 
<p>The idea of a dual clutch setup isn't new. In fact both Porsche and Audi 
have used transmissions based on similar principals in racecars during the 
1980s. Porsche's vaunted and terribly successful 956 and 962C race cars 
benefited from the Porsche Dual Klutch, or PDK, transmission. In 1985, Audi 
used a dual clutch transmission in the Pike's Peak Hillclimb winning Sport 
quattro S1 rally car. In both instances, since dual clutch transmissions 
provide &quot;shift without lift&quot; or uninterrupted power flow to the 
wheels through all the gears, these transmissions were extremely well suited 
for keeping the racecars' turbocharged motors &quot;on the boost.&quot;</p> 
<p>Serial production of a dual clutch or DSG transmission has been untenable 
to date due to insufficient means of mechanical (proper clutch actuation 
requires precise control of the simultaneous engagement and disengagement of 
the clutches) as well as electronic controls. Audi again proves its technical 
expertise and prowess by bringing this first-ever commercial application to the 
streets.</p> 
<p>This is the transmission of the future. Maximum torque capacity aside (this 
unit can only handle approximately 250 pound feet of torque) it bests offerings 
from the likes of BMW, Ferrari, and Maserati. The unit isn't perfect though. It 
offered some brilliant shifts and some not so brilliant (particularly some 
oddly timed downshifts while in automatic + sport mode), but for the most part 
every shift was smoothly executed-far smoother than anything BMW or Ferrari has 
been able to offer to date. There are three modes: automatic (which is as 
slick, or slicker, than a conventional automatic), automatic + sport mode 
(which is almost too aggressive in holding gears upon overrun) and manual mode, 
wherein the driver can control shifts from the steering wheel mounted paddles 
or the shift lever itself. For a more detailed discussion of the DSG 
transmission see the Spring 2003 edition of the quattro quarterly, page 32.</p> 
<p>I am enamored with the DSG as it provides the best semi-manual operation 
yet at the same time provides a smooth shifting automatic that those used to 
standard automatic transmissions would not object to driving. This true duality 
of purpose is something that BMW's SMG cannot provide, as it just isn't smooth 
enough. My main gripe with DSG is that in the manual mode it will still 
up-shift on its own at redline. While I am all for protections built into the 
system (i.e. not allowing one to downshift and over-rev the motor) I would 
prefer a less autonomous manual mode.</p> 
<p>The original TT 3.2 press release detailed that, &quot;a super 
high-performance feature of DSG is Launch Control, for F1-type starts.&quot; 
Much like BMW's SMG launch control a combination of choosing sport mode, 
switching off the ESP and then depressing the accelerator and brake pedals 
simultaneously would invoke the launch mode. Unfortunately, even though page 
116 of the early version of the TT 3.2's owner's manual specifies the above 
procedure, we were unable to bring it into play. We were later informed that 
Audi of America's legal eagles have killed launch control for the North 
American TTs. What remains to be determined is whether the launch control can 
be re-enabled with the use of the VAG 1551/1552 (or similar emulation tool like 
the VAG-COM or ProDiag) tool. One would think that the enthusiastic TT owner 
base will answer this question very early on.</p> 
<p>Revised suspension and running gear The TT would qualify as the go-kart of 
the Audi line, if you could call a 3,351 pound vehicle with a 58/42 front to 
rear weight distribution a go-kart. Nevertheless, as a result of the TT's 
handing characteristics, it is the closest thing that Audi has. Upon blasting 
through two hundred miles of Texas Hill Country, one comes to quickly 
appreciate the TT 3.2's revised-uprated spring and damper settings.</p> 
<p>The reworked suspension, quattro all wheel drive and improved brakes 
(derived from the Europe only B5 chassis RS4) help this TT continue in the 
tradition of its forebears. You might not win many stop light grand prix, but 
when the going gets twisty you'll certainly hold your own and then some. The 
DSG will put the power to the ground evenly through the gears and the quattro 
system will do its job, all you have to do is concentrate on the approaching 
apexes.</p> 
<p>Stylistically speaking The 2004 TT's interior design elements have 
withstood the test of time and continue to impress. The original bare aluminum 
interior items that inspired many vehicle interiors over the past five years 
continue their visual and tactile roles. Although many manufacturers have 
resorted to lower quality or even faux aluminum trim, the TT's genuine bits 
continue to set it apart.</p> 
<p>Interior materials, fit and finish are typical Audi, which is to say, the 
best currently available from any major manufacturer. The biggest interior 
change for the TT 3.2 Roadster is the availability of the black baseball glove 
leather seats, which is extremely handsome. It is a shame it isn't available on 
the coupe. A TT roadster with this interior, an Alcantara steering wheel, and 
all of the contrasting aluminum bits easily outdoes the offerings available 
from competitive roadsters.</p> 
<p>The TT 3.2 boasts a model specific front fascia with enlarged inlet 
openings to feed additional cooling air to the V6 motor, an extended front 
apron and vertical gills at the trailing edges of the front bumper. Out back a 
modified and larger version of the TT spoiler sits atop the rear deck. 
Although, for a vehicle that was originally designed without spoilers, the idea 
of a larger version seems somewhat peculiar. A honeycomb-pattern front grill 
and rear diffuser combined with 18&quot; RS4 nine-spoke wheels help add to the 
aggressive overall look.</p> 
<p>Tight package The TT 3.2 enjoys its first V6 motor and the first commercial 
application of a dual clutch gearbox. This combined with design tenets that 
continue to impress both owners and passers-by alike as well as enjoyable 
handling characteristics add up to another winning vehicle from the folks in 
Ingolstadt. Who knows what they will come up with next, but I am sure they will 
continue to please our need for progress through technology.</p>

Barcelona Driving Experience <br>
<br>

<p> (QQ, Winter 2004) &mdash; If I had to sum up my experience in Spain with 
two words they would be Woo Hoo! To say I had a good time would be the 
understatement of my life. I fell in love four times while in this beautiful 
country-with Barcelona, the people, the new S4, and a wonderful race track.</p> 
<p>As usual the people from Audi put on a great event. Everything was arranged 
with military precision. Even Mother Nature couldn't throw this group of 
professionals a curve ball in the form of a nasty thunderstorm on the second 
day of driving.</p> 
<p>I started off this adventure with a grueling flight from Kansas City to 
Atlanta and then on to Barcelona. I always wish I lived closer to the places I 
want to go, but life just didn't work out that way. It seems that everywhere I 
want to go is at least a ten hour plane ride. If I could afford to fly in first 
class it might not be so bad, but I would rather spend the difference on 
another trip or on the new S4.</p> 
<p>I arrived in Barcelona on August 14 in a somewhat worn condition. The good 
people at Audi sent a driver to pick me up at the airport. I arrived at the 
Hotel Diplomatic at about 11:30 am, went to my room and proceeded to take a two 
hour nap to get ready for a night on the town. After a welcome shower I 
migrated to the lobby for a beer in the hope I would catch some of the early 
arrivals from the states. Finally, one by one we had a nice group ready to go 
out on the town for some food and drink. The first night we walked around the 
city and ended up in a great Tappas bar. We spent the evening drinking great 
Spanish wine, eating Tappas, and talking the night away. The following day was 
spent exploring the town and visiting one of the organically styled Gaudi 
buildings not far from the hotel.</p> 
<p>That evening we met up with the Audi AG folk and our European counterparts 
in the bar for a few drinks prior to taking a bus tour on our way to the 
restaurant. The bus meandered through Barcelona taking us past a bull ring, the 
Olympic Village, and a lookout from which you could see most of the city.</p> 
<p>Once we arrived at the restaurant I was awestruck. The bistro resembled an 
old world structure set in a beautiful courtyard with trees, vines and little 
lights adorning a gazebo. A bright red S4 was parked in the corner of the 
courtyard. Everyone mingled, drank wine, and had appetizers in this fantastic 
setting prior to sitting down to dinner. Once at dinner we had time to chat and 
get to know each other a little better. It was interesting to hear what the 
drivers from Europe had to say about the new S4 and the experience they've had 
thus far. I enjoyed my conversation with one of the drivers from Germany who 
told of totaling his Porsche at the Nurburgring two weeks prior to coming to 
this event. All in all it was a great evening with an even better day to come.
</p> 
<p>Now for the meat of this trip-the reason for going-the new S4 and a race 
track. The first day consisted of a 7:00 am wake up call from Audi and 
breakfast. We took a 40 minute ride to the Circuit de Catalunya where we would 
spend the next two days. Once off the bus we attended a 30 minute drivers' 
meeting with instruction on track procedures and driving theory. After this we 
made our way to the pit area where a fleet of new S4 Avants awaited a group of 
eager drivers. We spent the first day learning car handling skills such as how 
to deal with over steer, under steer, emergency braking, and rapid lane change. 
On day two the fun really started when we put on our helmets. I had never worn 
a helmet at Audi's previous schools, so I knew things were about to get serious.
</p> 
<p>We spent the first part of the second morning lapping segments of the track 
with our instructor, Oliver Rudolph. Oliver taught us the course section by 
section with progressively higher speeds. By mid-morning a thunderstorm rolled 
in complete with hail and a tornado for good measure. We had to pull the cars 
into the pits under an overhang to prevent damage to the cars. After the worst 
of the storm passed we were back on the track in slick conditions which made 
quattro shine. By early afternoon the skies had cleared and the track was dry 
to the delight of all. We did not want to drive our afternoon hot laps in the 
rain.</p> 
<p>Shortly after lunch one by one they let the cars onto the track in ten 
second intervals to run the course for four laps. Each driver got two runs of 
four laps each on the course, as fast as their skill would allow. Some were 
faster than others, but everyone came back with a smile. The new S4 sounded 
amazing at full throttle on the front strait of the circuit. The 4.2 liter V8 
makes such incredible mechanical sounds that you might not even care if your 
car has a sound system. The gearbox in this car is the best I have ever 
shifted. The motor is so smooth and linear that you have no idea how fast you 
are picking up speed until you look down at a speedo that is climbing like mad. 
This is by far the finest car I have ever driven. I congratulate Audi for 
hitting a home run with the new S4.</p> 
<p>The final night with Audi was spent at a fantastic restaurant overlooking a 
harbor area festooned with yachts, palm trees, and a great view of the 
Mediterranean. As always the food was first class and a good time was had by 
all. This was my forth trip to an Audi AG Driving School and it was the best 
time I have ever had. This trip will bring a smile to my face for some time to 
come. I would like to thank Audi for the best time of my life.</p> 
<p>P.S. Audi, how soon can you get my new S4 here? </p> Read more <br>

<br>

<p>&nbsp; (QQ, Spring 2002) &mdash; Over the past few years, visitors to 
Ingolstadt have been greeted with a large-scale construction project as they 
made their way into the Audi factory grounds. What was going on-a new 
production line? No, the scale of the project was too small. It looked like 
more offices, as would be expected from a company that has experienced such 
huge growth over the past six years.</p>
