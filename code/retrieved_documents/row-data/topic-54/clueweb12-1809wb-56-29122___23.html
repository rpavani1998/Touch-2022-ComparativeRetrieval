<p><b>IS A SKUNK YOUR NEXT PET? or DO YOU CURRENTLY OWN ONE?</b><br>
 If you 
have said yes to either question, here is some highly important valuable 
information that you should know. Prepare yourself for problems unless you 
educate yourself and family members on raising and living with a skunk. Skunks 
have unique personality, health and dietary considerations that you should be 
aware of if your skunk is to become a member of your family. A baby skunk is 
not a puppy or a kitten, but an intelligent animal with its own set of natural 
actions and strange reactions!<br>
<br>
<b>NEW ARRIVAL</b><br>
 The baby skunk 
you buy from a pet store is about 4 to 8 weeks old, descented and VERY SCARED, 
as you would be if you were in this baby skunk's place. You have just been 
pulled from your Mom, brothers and sisters, rapidly descented, packed in a 
crate, thrown on a plane, flown to wherever and dropped in a pet shop with 
two-legged creatures that do not even speak fluent Skunkaneese! This could be 
you--suddenly beamed from your living room to the middle of Japan. Would you 
not be a little upset?<br>
<br>
 BABY SKUNKS ARRIVE AT THE PET SHOPS WITH ALL 
THEIR REPRODUCTIVE ORGANS INTACT! THEY HAVE ONLY HAD THEIR SCENT GLANDS 
REMOVED! THEY REQUIRE SPAYING, NEUTERING, DOG SHOTS, CAT SHOTS AND WORMING. DO 
NOT LET ANYONE RISK THE LIFE OF YOUR SKUNK WITH MISINFORMATION!!<br>
 Karo 
Syrup, Pancake Syrup and Gatorade or Bene-Bac by Borden will help at this time 
of shock and fear. You may have to hold your baby skunk by the scruff of the 
neck and drop a few drops of these fluids into its mouth. Some advanced 
planning before bringing this baby skunk home will help it to adjust sooner to 
you and it's new environment.<br>
 THE MORE YOU HOLD AND CUDDLE A BABY 
SKUNK--THE NICER SKUNK IT WILL BE LATER!<br>
<br>
<b>HANDLING AND PLAYING WITH 
BABY SKUNKS</b><br>
 Baby skunks love to play! Unlike other animals, such as 
dogs or cats, playing rough will cause your baby to become very aggressive and 
a biter as it grows older. NEVER play rough with your hands and NEVER 
discipline your skunk by hitting or swatting.<br>
 Use a stuffed toy or hand 
puppet when playing with your skunk to help protect your fingers. Skunks have 
sharp teeth and extremely long fangs that can seriously injure you during rough 
play or when being aggressive. Use your bare hands for loving and cuddling your 
baby.<br>
<br>
<b>FEET AND MOUTHS</b><br>
 From the very first day, it is 
imperative that you rub, fondle and play with your skunks feet and toes. You 
will later want to cut its toenails and if you don't play with its feet NOW, 
you won't be able to cut its toenails later!<br>
 You must also rub and play 
with its mouth and lips a great deal to lay the groundwork for giving your baby 
medicines later, should the need arise. Kiss your skunk, rub its mouth, tweak 
its tongue and nose, brush its teeth with a pet toothbrush now and avoid 
problems later! You can find pet toothbrushes and toothpaste at pet stores and 
your vets office.<br>
<br>
<b>SPANKING OR HITTING A BIG NO NO!</b><br>
 
Discipline should be the tone and volume of your voice. Never use your hands, 
rolled newspaper, fly swatter, etc, because, even though skunks don't see very 
well, their ears and nose work extremely well and their intellect tells them 
that YOU were at the end of that thing that just hit them. Remember, skunks 
never forget, nor do they forgive! You have never before dealt with an animal 
as smart as a skunk, unless you have had two year olds in your life.<br>
 The 
more you gently handle and fondle your baby skunk, the more docile it will be 
when it grows up. The more you hold and talk to a baby skunk, the more love 
will come your way from this skunk as it grows. More homes have been cleaned, 
meals prepared or football games watched with a baby skunk snuggled inside a 
T-shirt tucked into a waistband, than you could ever imagine. Being this close 
to you, the baby skunk will learn that it is great to be part of your family as 
you protect it, calm it down, feeling warm and wonderful all over that you are 
its new Mom or Dad! Be aware of where your baby skunk is in relation to your 
feet. Baby skunks are very easy to step on. They only know that your feet are 
part of you and they want to be near you, feet and all.<br>
<br>
<b>REAR BRAKES
</b><br>
 If you have never watched a herd of baby skunks playing together you 
will not understand the term &quot;REAR BRAKES&quot;, so let me explain the 
term--in a way that you will understand the charging, stomping whirlwind coming 
at you. The tail is flared out like a Christmas Tree, it may or may not be 
doing the &quot;Skunk Shuffle&quot; as it makes sort of a snorting/coughing 
sound, the front feet suddenly stop but the rear legs keep going, causing the 
skunk to almost fall forward on its little nose, therefore, it has no REAR 
BRAKES.<br>
 Do not be alarmed by the furry blur that has just shown signs of 
brake problems. It is not mad or angry, it is not trying to attack you, your 
skunk simply wants to play and this is part of the play ritual for skunks. In 
all the years I have been with skunks I have never seen a skunk injure itself 
falling on its nose. The only possible answer to this Rear Brake problem could 
be Cement Boots for the rear legs.<br>
<br>
<b>BABY SKUNK BEDROOMS</b><br>
 
Find a dark, relatively quiet place in your home to be used as the skunk's 
bedroom, such as a bathroom, an empty cabinet or very large box that a console 
TV or household appliance came in. Skunks AT ANY AGE confined to a small space 
for extended periods of time will become bad biters and aggressive. Allow your 
skunks to be with you, watch TV and roam the house as much as possible. If you 
had only a few feet to walk in and the same old four walls to look at, would 
you be a happy camper? If you do use your bathroom for the baby skunk's 
bedroom, be sure to keep the toilet lid down to prevent drowning. Remove all 
harmful items and cleaning materials from under the sink if the cabinet can be 
easily opened.<br>
<br>
<b>BEDDING</b><br>
 Old towels, clothing, sheets or 
blankets make perfect snugglies, as they can be washed and kept clean. Give 
them plenty of snugglies or they will steal your socks and T-shirts or you 
could wake up very cold one morning just because your skunk has removed all 
cover from your body to make a warm wonderful nest for them. Don't try to make 
their bed for them. It is great fun to watch them rearrange their new home as 
they transport very large blankets or what ever from one end of your house to 
the other. You will not believe a 3 pound skunk pulling a king size bedspread 
as they walk backwards and shoving the bedspread under them.<br>
<br>
<b>FOOD 
AND WATER BOWLS</b><br>
 Heavy, easy to clean bowls that cannot be easily 
turned over are best. Wide, shallow pans or casserole dishes work well. Fresh, 
clean water should be available at all times.<br>
<br>
<b>POTTY TRAINING</b><br>
 Skunks are naturally very clean animals and &quot;corner trained&quot; 
instinctively. The baby WILL chose its own corner! For now, accept your skunk's 
choice. Place several thicknesses of newspaper or a litter pan with UNSCENTED 
kitty litter in the corner your skunk has chosen. (Placing a plastic garbage 
bag on the floor under the newspaper will make clean-up easier.) If it has an 
accident and doesn't make it to its corner, remove offense and saturate the 
area with plain white vinegar. You must pour enough so that the carpet, the 
padding and the floor underneath get soaked. As the vinegar dries, the odor is 
neutralized and your skunk should not return to that spot. The vinegar should 
not harm your carpets and your home will smell like a salad for only about 10 
minutes. Keep the area that your skunk has chosen cleaned regularly since 
skunks will avoid a smelly bathroom.<br>
 With a lot of patience and a fair 
amount of time, you can move his or her bathroom to a place more acceptable to 
you. Each day, move the newspaper or litter pan 4 inches toward a corner you 
can let the skunk have as a bathroom. If you are lucky, he will follow. If not, 
give in gracefully, let him have his corner and block the view with a chair or 
bookcase placed catty-cornered or some other decorative idea. Learning to live 
with a skunk DOES involve compromise, usually on your part.<br>
 On a weekly 
basis, clean the litter box or floor with a solution of 1/4 cup of Clorox to 1 
gallon of warm water. This formula will not cause health problems or damage 
your skunk's lungs and should not damage your carpet.<br>
<br>
<b>TOYS</b><br>
 
Use safe, chewable toys like Ping-Pong balls, tennis balls, brown paper bags, 
cardboard boxes, old socks with knots tied in them, and an absolute 
favorite-very fuzzy stuffed toys. Be sure that your skunk cannot accidentally 
chew off and swallow portions of the toy, such as the eyes.<br>
<br>
<b>
VETERINARIAN</b><br>
 Find a vet who does not mind working with skunks and has 
worked with them in the past. Be VERY CHOOSY in your decision for a good vet. 
This is the person who will help you keep your baby healthy and happy for many 
years. Ask the prospective vet: &quot;What will you do if my skunk bites 
someone on your staff?&quot; Your skunk may not be safe if it accidentally 
bites someone. It could be killed and tested for Rabies if this should happen, 
so save yourself much pain--ASK! We have a few vets listed who work with us who 
may help you or could help find a vet in your area.<br>
<br>
<b>ROUNDWORMS</b>
<br> ALL SKUNKS HAVE ROUNDWORMS. Even if they are not found in fecal testing, 
they are in your skunk's body and he must be wormed once a month. We recommend 
Evict or Nemex 2 liquid dog wormers. Your vet probably uses Strongid, which is 
&quot;prescription strength&quot; If you prefer the All Natural way you can use 
seeds from Cantaloupe, Fig Juice or Cloves. These will not harm your skunk in 
any way and are very safe to use.<br>
 Symptoms are rubbing bottoms on the 
floor, bad breath, coughing, lack of appetite, bloating, hiccups and rectal 
prolapse. The problem with roundworms and skunks is you cannot kill the round 
worms until they attach themselves to the intestine. Some round worms just 
float around in the blood stream filling up the lungs and heart and it is so 
common in the animal world to have roundworms that people just forget how 
serious a problem this can be.<br>
<br>
<b>TAPE WORMS</b><br>
 If you have a 
flea problem your skunk could have Tapeworms. All it takes is for a skunk to 
swallow a flea while grooming their fur. The signs are: eats like a horse and 
loses weight, loses hair and is not very active. In the years I have had skunks 
only two have had tapeworms to show up in fecal testing. This worm problem will 
have to be handled by your vet. (PS-the Tapeworm Shot works best.) In about two 
days after being treated, skunks appear to have taken the Magic Formula! They 
are eating, looking good and they act as if they feel better. It will not harm 
your skunk, so if by some strange outside chance your skunk has a bad case of 
the blahs have them treated for Tapeworms.<br>
<br>
<b>REQUIRED SKUNK SHOTS</b>
<br> Baby skunks require a series of shots that should begin as soon as you get 
your skunk. Both canine and feline shots are needed for baby skunks as young as 
four weeks of age. Don't be fooled by misinformation about shots for your skunk 
as it could cost their life! More skunks have died needlessly from things they 
can't get and won't have, such as Feline Distemper, Canine Distemper, Parvo or 
Corona virus, than you could believe. Unless you live in a hermetically sealed 
house, never open doors or windows, never go out and come in, YOUR ANIMALS NEED 
SHOTS!! Many viruses and bacteria are airborne: therefore, it is imperative 
that they be protected. It is painful knowing that you could have prevented the 
death with a simple shot.<br>
 The currently recommended vaccines are: Galaxy 
DA2PPvL+Cv and Eclipse 4 given as a baby and then a yearly booster. This 
information came from the San Diego Zoo after several skunks died from Canine 
Distemper because of being given the wrong vaccine. We have documented cases of 
skunk deaths due to Feline Distemper, as recently as 1993. These deaths can be 
prevented by proper immunization! IMMUNIZE YOUR SKUNK PROPERLY! REMEMBER--A 
HAPPY, HEALTHY SKUNK BEGINS WITH YOU!!! Proper medical care is better for your 
skunk and better for your pocketbook in the long run.<br>
<br>
<b>SKUNK 
PROOFING YOUR HOME</b><br>
 For the safety of your skunk, these things must be 
done immediately! They are not expensive, they are just practical.<br>
 
CABINETS: Child-proof locks will keep skunks out of unacceptable cabinets. Use 
the simple screen door latches, they work better for adults.<br>
 POTTED 
PLANTS: Must be kept out of the reach of skunks. Some house plants are toxic! 
They will also dig all of the dirt out of the pots just to see what is in the 
bottom.<br>
 PURSES, SCHOOL BAGS, ETC: Skunks will remove the contents and 
scatter everything all over the house. Keep them off the floor and out of 
harm's way.<br>
 VENTS TO THE OUTSIDE: Dryer vents, air- conditioning vents or 
any other vents that lead to the outside must be secured! A baby skunk can 
flatten itself enough to crawl between the vent and the wall. A dryer vent is 
unceremoniously pulled off and out through the hole they go.<br>
 A SKUNK THAT 
ESCAPES TO THE OUTSIDE IS RARELY FOUND!!<br>
 CERAMICS OR GLASSWARE: Keep these 
very high and away from the reach of your skunk's little paws. Skunks will pull 
things off tables, shelves or any low area that they can reach.<br>
<br>
<b>NOT 
THE PUPPY--NOT THE KITTY</b><br>
 Baby skunks are not puppies or kittens and 
can't be raised as such! They were rejects from a fur farm and require more 
handling than puppies or kittens. When you first get your baby skunk, hold it 
as much as it will allow, in your arms, in your lap or tucked inside your 
shirt. This will help the skunk to know you, forming a stronger bond. This is 
also the time to start hand-feeding your skunk so that it will learn to avoid 
your fingers at treat time. Commonly used treats are grapes, apple slices, 
raisins, dog biscuits, etc. Feed them treats that they enjoy, but that are also 
healthy for them, but definitely feed them in moderation. Physical discipline 
and rough-housing can create a mean and aggressive animal. While rough-housing 
with a 1 pound baby may be cute, when he weighs 8 pounds and has fangs 1/2 inch 
long, it will not be nearly as cute. Though they may not see extremely well, 
his nose and ears will tell him that you are the one that hurt him, even if you 
are on the end of a fly swatter or newspaper. Use a loud voice or other loud 
noise, such as a hair dryer or Dust Buster or try a squirt from a water gun or 
plant misting bottle. Skunks are super intelligent, they never forget and never 
forgive!<br>
<br>
<b>NO HOMING INSTINCTS</b><br>
 Skunks are naturally curious 
and very agile--a deadly combination. You must learn to exist in a 
skunk-proofed home. Keep doors and cabinets closed, keep clothes and linens off 
the floors (or they will disappear!). Even dryers, refrigerators and 
dishwashers are to be explored (they all smell like food), so be careful and 
watchful at all times.<br>
 Being naturally curious, if a skunk escapes 
outside, it will not return on its own. It just follows its nose to wherever. 
Pet skunks are rarely recaptured or returned to the owner. Since it has no 
defenses and the scent glands have been removed, it will probably be killed by 
dogs or cars. Chase Down The Baby Skunk is not a game that is a lot of fun or a 
game that ends in joy and happiness for the owner or the skunk!<br>
<br>
<b>
DIGGING</b><br>
 All skunks have the natural instinct to dig. After all, they 
dig up much of their food in the wild. Your carpets or walls may be the object 
of digging. Watch your skunk carefully and discourage this behavior from the 
beginning. A good squirt from the trusty old water bottle may help, but if not, 
POUR white vinegar on the spot where the skunk is digging. Something he smells 
is attracting him to this area with an odor that we can't smell. Even if you 
shampoo the carpet, the odor remains in the padding or even the wood beneath, 
so use the vinegar liberally. Some dog repellents might also help, or the use 
of a hair dryer, Dust Buster, other loud noise. Skunks do not like closed doors 
and will dig at the door just to find what room is on the other side. A piece 
of Plexi-glass, plastic carpet runner or the like placed under the door will 
stop this digging.<br>
<br>
<b>CLIMBING</b><br>
 Some skunks can climb. MOST 
outgrow climbing. When people will tell you that skunks can't climb, they mean 
trees, mountains or stuff like that. However, these are people who have never 
found a skunk waving to them from a kitchen counter! If your skunk is a 
climber, keep chairs, stools, bookcases, boxes and ladders away from cabinets, 
drawers, tables, sofas and chairs or any other place that your skunk finds 
interesting. Skunks cannot climb trees -- but they can climb into bed with you. 
If possible, remove the temptations and attempt to distract them from what they 
are doing. Skunks are very persistent once they have learned how to do 
something. Skunks generally outgrow most of their bad behavior, usually by 
their first birthday because they are bottom heavy. Have patience--they are 
worth it!!<br>
<br>
<b>SUNSHINE FOR YOUR SKUNK</b><br>
 Skunks at any and all 
ages need a little sunshine every day. They prefer afternoon sun to morning 
sun. Leave the shades or blinds open in the room where they spend the most 
time, or sit outside with them for a good brushing, thereby killing 2 birds 
with 1 stone. Skunks benefit from Vitamin D-3, just as you do. Please keep in 
mind that skunks are prone to heat stroke, which could be fatal, so do not 
overdo the sun.<br>
<br>
<b>SKUNK ANCESTRY</b><br>
 Mephitis Mephitis: No, the 
computer does not have a short-circuit, this is how our skunks are known in the 
great and wonderful world of Knowledge. Translated from Latin, it means 
&quot;stinks stinks.&quot; In more common usage, it means, &quot;Striped, 
hooded skunk.&quot; Our skunks great, great, great grandparents were on 
America's shores to welcome Christopher Columbus and the other strange looking 
four-legged creatures that came with good old Chris. We are living with the 
only TRUE American Pet -The Skunk!<br>
 Skunks are born with many colors, 
stripe styles, chips, swirls and even solid colors. They may change color as 
they mature (or they may not!). Gray baby skunks tend to become white adults, 
but we know of several adult gray skunks. A light brown baby may go through the 
red spectrum into dark, rich brown as an adult. An albino baby may be cream 
now, then become blinding white as an adult or stay cream-colored. Then again, 
a Brunette skunk may stay Brunette all of its life. What this all boils down to 
is this; you may never know what color your skunk will be. You may only know 
what color they are right now!<br>
 Certain sources classify our skunks as 
exotic animals. They are not from a foreign country, they are not spices, and 
they do not dance the striptease. Unusual? Yes! Exotic? NO!!<br>
<br>
<b>
ADOLESCENT BEHAVIOR</b><br>
 About 3 to 6 Months Old Late summer and fall are a 
most trying time for a young skunk and it's owner -- THE NASTIES BEGIN!<br>
 
You could avoid most all of the associated problems by having your male skunk 
neutered by 3 months of age or your female skunk spayed by 4 months of age. 
Some skunks have entered the heat cycle as early as August, others as late as 
January. However, you DO NOT want to wait and find out.<br>
 The heat cycle can 
kill your skunk! You cannot compare what you have heard about skunks in the 
wild to the skunk living in your home. Your skunk is not in the same 
environment and should be treated differently. The best solution for a healthy 
skunk, saving a lot of heartbreak or hurt feelings, fingers and toes is to have 
all skunks spayed or neutered well before they are 6 months old.<br>
 Skunks 
can be sexually mature when they are three months of age, however skunks do not 
stop growing until they are about 18 months to two years old. This is why no 
one understands about early heat cycles in skunks. You have to know lots of 
skunks for long periods of time. Shermie was 3 months old and weighed about 2 
pounds when he HAD TO BE NEUTERED! Mimi was 4 months old when she HAD TO BE 
SPAYED! She was already in full blown heat...,screaming, snapping and biting 
anything that moved. Mimi only lived for about two years after spaying, however 
the stress of the heat cycle was too much for her system and she never 
recovered completely.<br>
<br>
<b>FEMALE SKUNK</b><br>
 Female skunks can and 
will go in and out of heat for long periods of time. This causes severe stress 
to their systems, causing serious health problems or even death, as well as 
behavioral problems. Some early symptoms of impending heat are constant pacing, 
sudden weight loss, finicky appetite, aggressive, almost savage, behavior and 
biting. This period should last from 2 to 4 weeks, but could go on even longer. 
Female skunks are under tremendous physical stress during this time, and are 
prone to kidney problems, heart attacks or other major health problems if not 
spayed at about 4 months. If your female skunk appears to have a prolonged and 
intense cycle, you should have her spayed immediately! Unlike cats, it is safe 
for a skunk in heat to be spayed. It could take 2 months or 2 years for your 
female to return to her normal behavior if you wait too long to spay her. Spay 
all females before their first heat cycle and avoid SKUNK P M S:<br>
 P -- PRE, 
POST, POSSIBLY PERMANENT<br>
 M -- MATING<br>
 S -- SYNDROME<br>
<br>
<b>MALE 
SKUNKS</b><br>
 The attitudes are the same as for a female except that they 
display even more aggressive behavior and severe biting. Aggressive behavior 
lasts a much longer time. This can be serious and an extended problem to the 
owner, since there is no method of controlling this natural behavior. Some male 
skunks have been known to be serious biters as early as 3 months old. The only 
solution is to have him neutered. This will not in any way change the 
personality of your male skunk. He will always be a boy -- just not a bad boy! 
Male skunks should be neutered when they first begin displaying this aggressive 
behavior or whenever testicles are first seen, and this could be as early as 3 
months of age. Very few un-neutered males make good, gentle-natured pets. If 
you wait too long to solve this problem, behavior retraining may be the only 
way to live with your skunk and it may not work.<br>
<br>
<b>ADULT SKUNKS</b>
<br> By the time a skunk reaches 8 months of age, it is considered to be adult, 
as it has reached sexual maturity and you deserve a medal for completing 
infant, terrible twos and teen-age behavior in a very short period; however, 
skunks will not stop growing until they are about 18 months old. You will not 
know how long, how tall, or what color your skunk may be until this time. This 
is when the baby problems have all gone, your skunk has been spayed or neutered 
and you now have a really great pet. Sit back-put your feet on the coffee table 
and give yourself a big hug for you are truly a very special person.<br>
<br>

<b>NORWEGIAN SNOW KITTY</b><br>
 (Tongue-in-cheek!) You have recovered from the 
heart attack you almost had because you thought the burglars were stealing your 
kitchen, only to find baby skunks, playing in the pots and pans around 4 
o'clock in the morning; you are picking up all your clothes as your mother 
wanted you to do as a child; you are eating healthier; but the one thing that 
still bugs you as a skunk owner is: &quot;It's a what?&quot; &quot;It 
smells.&quot; It will give a strange disease or all skunks are black and white!
<br> I have found that uninformed questions and answers drive me crazy after 
all these years. I have found a way for all people to love my skunks just as I 
do. No more of this loving, stroking my animal, saying how beautiful it is 
until they find out I am holding a skunk. Suddenly their hand starts to smell, 
they walk backwards from you holding their hand away from their bodies with a 
look of horror on their faces. As long as these people think they are loving 
and stroking a Norwegian Snow Kitty they are impressed. &quot;I must have one, 
wait until my friends know I played with a real live Norwegian Snow 
Kitty!&quot; See how simple I just made life for you? It works every time. 
Norwegian Snow Kitties, (under-cover skunks), will not steal the remote control 
from the TV and change channels on you. Most important, your friends think you 
are a very special person now and not crazy enough to live with a skunk. You 
are blessed now beyond your wildest dreams!<br>
<br>
<b>HIBERNATION?</b><br>
 
Skunks are not true hibernators, they just take long naps. During the Fall, a 
skunk should be kept awake and active about 4 or 5 hours a day. Most of our 
skunks rarely show any signs of hibernating except for the demand for more 
food. In the Fall, every skunk will instinctively look for more food, as they 
feel it is time to prepare for their long Winter naps. You must be strong! DO 
NOT increase the amount of food your skunk is getting no matter what it tells 
you!! This is the time that most skunks will keep any extra weight on their 
body and it is very difficult to get it off until Spring. Since the light bulb 
came into your skunk's life, it has made its daylight hours longer. Animals 
know when to take long Winter naps by how much daylight it has in its life. 
Winter--days are shorter. Summer -- days are longer. Along came Edison with his 
light bulb and your domestic skunk has no real need to hibernate. We have 
discovered that most of our skunks prefer to hibernate under our electric 
blanket. Please keep in mind that you are not living with a wild animal! Your 
skunk came from a fur farm right into your home and enjoys the same comforts 
that you do!<br>
 If you leave your skunk, leave the radio or TV on. They like 
it! It keeps them from being lonely and keeps them out of trouble. Some skunks 
like the Teen-age Mutant Ninja Turtles, X-Men and the Dinosaucers best.<br>
<br>
<b>BREEDING DOMESTIC SKUNKS</b><br>
 Skunks are not like any other domestic 
animal you have ever been around when it comes to breeding or caring for their 
young. Domestic skunks do not breed well in your homes. All those out there 
with dog and cat mentality about mama dogs and cats are in for a large, 
enormous and very painful surprise. To put this in terms that can best be 
understood by one and all: the question is &quot;had you rather do a Texas 
Two-Step with a grizzly Bear or be in the same room with a mother skunk?&quot; 
The answer is, &quot;Start the music!&quot;<br>
 Skunks are induced ovulators, 
which means there is a lot of biting, chewing, bleeding and screaming before 
they can breed. Females with their young are the most savage animals in the 
animal kingdom. You cannot hold and fondle the new kittens, you will not know 
how many, what color or what sex they are, you have lost a good pet and 
possibly a few fingers and toes. People are used to the behavior of dogs and 
cats; their feelings are hurt when their lap baby comes growling, snapping, 
biting and stomping at them when they enter the area with the female and her 
babies.<br>
 Savage behavior is not the only problem. I had 3 females to have 
babies at one time, accidents do happen. The three moms had 37 kittens. Out of 
the 37 kittens, 4 survived and of the 3 mothers, 2 survived. It all cost a 
little over $1,000.00. The cost of all this was much lower than the average pet 
owner since I had better knowledge of domestic skunks than most and I was able 
to do most of the care myself. Also, descenting the babies is not easy. You 
must find a vet who is willing to do descenting. Good luck in your search! 
These are all very good reasons why I recommend leaving the breeding to 
breeders and getting your skunk fixed ASAP!! If you still are not convinced, I 
will let you count my broken fingers, toes and the scars I have from surprise 
skunk pregnancies. Accidents do happen!<br>
<br>
<b>BABY SKUNK FEEDING</b><br>
 
RAPID GROWTH SYNDROME ALERT! Baby skunks weigh about 1 ounce when they come 
into this world. By the time they are 8 months old, they weigh about 8 pounds, 
which is about right. The average newborn child has about 16 years to reach its 
maximum growth. Your baby skunk has 12 to 18 months to grow strong teeth, 
muscles, bones and organs. It must have calcium, protein and all essential 
vitamins and minerals in the right proportions to THEIR growth rate, not ours.
<br> Handfuls and bowlsful of dog food and junk food give too much calcium and 
protein, leading to bad teeth, arthritis, degenerative bone disease and 
paralysis later in life. Do not be tempted or talked into feeding more protein 
foods than are recommended here.<br>
<br>
<b>4 Weeks To About 12 Weeks</b><br>
 
If your baby skunk does not have teeth or is having a hard time chewing solid 
food, soak Purina O.N.E., Science Diet Canine Growth or Pro-Plan Adult for dogs 
in canned diluted Goat's milk, K.M.R. or Just Born&reg; Milk Replacer Plus 
Colostrum from Farnam Pet Products, until it can eat solid foods. All dog food 
is very hard to soften, so I suggest that you make enough for several days. 
Chop enough very fine veggies for the same period of time, saving time for you. 
Canned VegAll works well.<br>
 DO NOT EVER, UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES, FEED CAT 
FOOD OF ANY KIND, UNLESS ADVISED TO DO SO BY YOUR VET, FOR CERTAIN RARE MEDICAL 
PROBLEMS!!<br>
 All skunks should receive a daily FeloBit vitamin; however, DO 
NOT USE Aviatron Liquid Vitamins for your skunk. Linatone Plus should be given 
daily to prevent a D-3 deficiency. Introduce vegetables into your skunk's diet 
as soon as possible. At birth, a skunk weighs about one ounce and then grows 
very rapidly. It does not stay a baby very long. Therefore, it does not need to 
be on baby food or formula for more than 8 weeks. If it is kept on a high 
protein, high fat diet for very long, your skunk's long-term stay in your life 
could be endangered.<br>
 90% of a skunk's diet, regardless of age, should 
consist of vegetables. The remaining 10% should consist of fruits, low-fat 
cottage cheese, low-fat yogurt and either (feed only one at a time, they do not 
need all three at one meal) boiled chicken, water-packed fish or dog food. They 
may have certain sweets in small amounts occasionally.<br>
 NEVER FEED AN 
ANIMAL CHOCOLATE OF ANY KIND!! IT CAN KILL THEM!<br>
<br>
<b>4 WEEKS TO 8 WEEKS
</b><br>
 From 4 to 8 weeks of age, your baby skunk should be fed 4 meals a day 
as much as it can eat at one time. This is the time of very rapid growth and it 
needs a good food supply to get up and going on the right track.<br>
 Offer a 
wide variety of vegetables, such as squash, mushrooms, peas, corn, and a few 
bites of fruit chosen from the lists included in this brochure. At this age, 
chop the food rather small, maybe into 1/4 inch cubes. Offer low-fat cottage 
cheese mixed with the vegetables once a day, low-fat yogurt mixed at another 
meal and maybe finely chopped boiled chicken for supper. A late night snack 
could maybe be 5 or 6 raisins and a few pieces of popcorn. Be creative and feed 
a broad spectrum of foods for a happy, healthy skunk.<br>
<br>
<b>8 WEEKS TO 12 
WEEKS</b><br>
 From 8 to 12 weeks, feed 3 times a day, basically the same diet 
with greater variations. One, single sugar cookie or 1/4 of a Graham cracker or 
1 butter cookie or 1 vanilla wafer can be added to the diet at this time, BUT 
ONLY ONE! Skunks have a huge sweet tooth, so you must be strong and give only 
one. The purpose of incorporating a small amount of sugar into their diet is 
twofold. First, a small sugar is required for the proper absorption of calcium 
for strong bones and teeth. Second, a tiny amount of sugar seems to help in 
weight control. Make sure you understand we said ONE cookie, not 1 pound or 1 
box!<br>
 Sprinkle 1/4 teaspoon of non-fat dry milk, such as Carnation, over 
the food once a day, for additional calcium and the prevention of degenerative 
bone disease later in life.<br>
 EXAMPLE OF DAILY DIET; 10 TO 20 PIECES OF DOG 
FOOD, 1 1/4 CUPS VEGGIES AND FRUITS, COTTAGE CHEESE, YOGURT AND ONE COOKIE. 
DIVIDE INTO 4 MEALS!<br>
<br>
 Morning -- 3 pieces of dog food, 2 or 3 slices 
of squash, carrot, cucumber, celery and orange slices with cottage cheese.<br>
 
Noon -- 3 pieces of dog food, 1/4 cup of Shredded Wheat dry cereal, 2 or 3 
slices of rutabaga, tomato, bell peppers, a few pods of okra mixed with yogurt.
<br> Night -- 3 pieces of dog food, peas, corn, romaine, a few pieces of 
cauliflower, 1 Vanilla wafer, 1 Tablespoon rice or pasta, 1/4 teaspoon of 
nonfat dry milk sprinkled over their food.<br>
 Before bedtime snack -- a 
handful of plain popcorn, 1 dog biscuit, 5-6 raisins, 3 or 4 pieces of dog food.
<br> The above vegetables &amp; fruit suggestions are not etched in stone, 
therefore, use your own creativity and availability of veggies and fruits in 
each season. I know of no law that says you cannot buy 1 carrot, 1 squash, 1 
artichoke. You can give your skunk a great variety of veggies daily without 
waste. What would you do if you had to eat only French fries and hamburgers 4 
or 5 times a day for the rest of your life? As you are strolling among the 
veggies at the super market keep in mind, VARIETY IS THE SPICE OF LIFE!<br>
 If 
you are not at home with your baby skunk during the day, just before leaving 
put the noon meal out. This will teach your skunk that daytime is a wonderful 
place to be. Your skunk will not be starving when you return home.<br>
 Skunks 
are just like babies, some will eat ten cups full of food while others will not 
eat all you give them. However, if your baby skunk appears to still be looking 
for more food, give them some more vegetables. Until you know what amounts of 
food your skunk will eat, give them enough food to satisfy.<br>
<br>
<b>12 
WEEKS TO 16 WEEKS</b><br>
 From 12 to 16 weeks: Cut meals down to twice a day 
with a snack in the morning, late evening or whenever it works for your 
schedule. This is the time to reduce the amount of dog food to 8 to 10 pieces a 
day, continue with the dry milk and ONE cookie a day. By now your skunk should 
be eating just about any vegetable and fruit that the stores can supply. After 
4 months, feed 1 meal and 1 snack daily or use the same feeding routine as 
before but decrease the amount of dog food and give more veggies. You live with 
your skunk, I do not, if it makes you and your skunk happy to have lunch-by all 
means give them lunch!<br>
 Some skunk owners have found that cauliflower 
increases stool odor unbelievably. It can also cause odor in some skunks. 
Experiment with your skunk. If it eats it and then smells, you can leave 
cauliflower out of the diet. It is a wonderful source of many vitamins and 
minerals, but so are many other veggies! Substitute something else!<br>
<br>
<b>
FOUR MONTHS TO THREE YEARS OLD</b><br>
 An adult skunk should only have 15 
calories per pound of body weight-that is less than 150 calories a day 
regardless of age, weight or activity level. Adjust the amount of food to your 
skunk's weight. Probably the most important factor in maintaining a healthy 
skunk is proper diet that includes a large assortment of vegetables daily.<br>
 
Improper diet and obesity have been traced to the majority of premature deaths 
we have experienced. Skunks DO NOT need cups of food to be very healthy 
animals. Quite the contrary, A LITTLE GOES A LONG WAY! Vegetables contain very 
little fats and skunks are mainly vegetarians. Surprise ! Skunks that are fed 
mainly vegetables just look better. Their coats are very shiny, they appear to 
be healthier and I have never seen a skunk that is too fat or too thin when fed 
properly. Love and concern are very powerful tools that can make your skunk 
perfect in every way. However, too much love can make a skunk too big or too 
little.<br>
<br>
<b>FAT SKUNK</b><br>
 It is very easy for a skunk to become 
obese. They act as they are never full, will eat almost anything and are always 
begging for food. The easiest way to control your skunk's weight is to feed it 
proper amounts of the right foods and give it low fat, low calorie healthy 
snacks. A filled coffee saucer is a good amount to feed your skunk from the 
diet sheet in this brochure. Obesity leads to severe liver, heart and kidney 
damage and we have rarely seen an obese skunk live long even if it loses the 
weight. A healthy skunk should have a thick, glossy coat, white (not yellow) 
stripes, bright clear eyes and, above all, not be overweight. Regardless of 
what your skunk tells you, CONTROL IT'S DIET! You teach the skunk about 
diet--don't let him teach you. It is far easier to control your skunk's weight 
before the fact, than to correct it after the fact. One furry, 20 pound 
basketball with legs and eyes does not look like a skunk but a very unique 
doorstop.<br>
<br>
<b>SKINNY SKUNKS</b><br>
 Please keep in mind that your 
skunk is not a fashion model and does not have to have the long, lean, slinky 
look. This too can cause more problems than you could ever dream of, such as, 
brain damage, nerve damage, stunted growth, and just plain meanness!!! Use your 
own ideas about the right way to eat when feeding your skunk. Mother always 
told you to eat a balanced diet and all your veggies and you would grow up to 
be big and strong ! A two foot, 3 pound skunk is not a pretty sight. It is just 
plain ugly !<br>
<br>
<b>MATURE SKUNKS 3 YEARS AND ABOVE</b><br>
 As with older 
dogs and cats (and people, too), skunks need to have their protein, fat and 
calorie intake lowered. This does not mean starve your skunk to death! Give 
Lite types of dog food, vegetables, fiber, chicken, water-packed fish, as well 
as rice and dried beans cooked together. These are proteins that are easily 
digested by the older animal.<br>
 Some of the serious health problems have 
been solved with these simple diet adjustments. Cleo was 21 1/2 years old and 
looked and acted like a 1 year old, all because of what we have learned about 
diet. Cleo did not eat dog food at all after she was about 5 years old.<br>
 
When I started with skunks the average age of a skunk was maybe 3 and this was 
thought to be an old skunk, but now more and more knowledge is coming to light 
and our skunks are living longer and healthier lives. It made me feel very good 
about the work I have been doing with these animals when for the first time 
ever there was a SUPER SENIOR CLASS IN THE NATIONAL SHOW FOR TEN YEAR OLD 
SKUNKS AND ABOVE!<br>
 There is no way anyone can force you to follow these 
suggestions. I only tell you what has worked and is working for mine and 
hundreds of other skunks.<br>
<br>
<b>FOR ALL AGES</b><br>
 For some time 
skunks have been coming up with problems with their bones and teeth by the time 
the they are about 3 years old. Paralysis, limps and lost teeth were the way of 
life when you lived with a skunk. Not any more! With the addition of non-fat 
dry milk, such as Carnation, Vitamin C and sugar to their daily diet, the 
problems are becoming fewer and fewer.<br>
 Non fat milk, 1 tsp. per day 
sprinkled over their food, oranges, grapefruit, lime or lemon, Jalapeno peppers 
(which they love), for natural Vitamin C or a liquid Vitamin C over or in their 
food, and (very easy way to measure sugar here) ONE vanilla wafer, ONE sugar 
cookie or 1/4 graham cracker, not the whole box or bag, just one-- these are 
ways to get their bodies to make use of the calcium for stronger bones, teeth 
and better looking coats with the prevention of tooth or gum infections made 
easy, simple and cost effective.<br>
 You will hear that your skunk is a hunter 
and must hunt for food........this is true. It will hunt for the refrigerator, 
the microwave and you.<br>
<br>
<b>DAILY DIET FOR ADULT AND MATURE SKUNKS</b>
<br> PROTEIN:<br>
 Baked or boiled Chicken or water packed tuna fish or cooked 
dried beans with rice or 6 to 10 pieces of dog food per day, such as O.N.E. or 
Adult Formula Pro Plan.<br>
<br>
 VEGETABLES:<br>
 A variety of mixed 
vegetables, fresh, frozen, or cooked. If canned vegetables are used, such as 
Veg-All, rinse with cold water to remove excess salt that is unhealthy for your 
skunk. Feed all they want within reason.<br>
<br>
 FRUITS:<br>
 One slice of an 
apple or orange, 2 or 3 grapes or any fruit that may be in season at any time 
of year. If using canned fruits, rinse with cold water to remove excess sugar.
<br> <br>
 USE FRUITS IN MODERATION! TOO MUCH FRUIT CAN CAUSE MUSCLE MASS LOSS, 
DEHYDRATION, DIARRHEA, CONVULSIONS, AND DEATH!<br>
<br>
 DAIRY:<br>
 Low-fat 
cottage cheese, 1 Tablespoon per day. Some skunks cannot digest diary products 
well and this could cause diarrhea. One teaspoon Of non-fat dry milk, such as 
Carnation, will boost calcium without diarrhea.<br>
<br>
 YOGURT:<br>
 
Approximately 1 Tablespoon per day to aid in digestion. Helps to control 
infections, upset tummies and diarrhea. The first time you give yogurt, give 
only a tiny bit and watch your baby's stool. Rarely, there is a lactose 
intolerant skunk!<br>
<br>
 VITAMINS &amp; MINERALS<br>
 A Multi-vitamin / 
Mineral including Taurine, such as Felo-Bits for cats, Vitamins E, D-3 and 
Brewers Yeast and Lecithin should be included every day.<br>
<br>
 FIBER:<br>
 
High fiber cereal, such as Shredded Wheat, Cheerios, whole grain breads, dog 
biscuits, unsalted plain popcorn or 1/2 teaspoon of Fiber All or Metamucil 
daily.<br>
<br>
 CARBOHYDRATES:<br>
 Small baked or boiled potato or 1/2 slice 
of whole wheat bread or pasta or rice once per day.<br>
<br>
 SNACKS:<br>
 
NEVER feed a skunk Junk Food - Skunks easily become addicted to junk food, such 
as Corn Chips, Potato Chips or ice cream. Use veggies, popcorn, dog biscuits or 
dry cereal.<br>
<br>
 EGGS: <br>
 One boiled egg per week has been recommended 
by the San Diego Zoo.<br>
<br>
 FOODS TO AVOID<br>
 Red meats (Beef) -- Pork of 
any kind -- Cat foods -- High protein dog food -- Moist canned dog food -- 
Chocolate - Fried foods -- Bee pollen -- Sunflower Seeds - Iceberg lettuce -- 
Dried corn or grasses. Any food containing high percentages of fats, such as 
any of the IAMS products. Dried fruits or foods containing Sulfur Dioxide. 
Chocolate, such as, M &amp; M's, Snickers or Oreo Cookies, has caused death in 
several skunks. The hulls on Sunflower seeds will perforate the skunk's 
intestines causing death. Bee pollen is found in some vitamins and can cause an 
allergic reaction and death.<br>
 Learn to read labels! It could save a life!!
<br> Experiment! Expose your skunk to a wide variety of foods-you'll both be 
happier for it, and the skunk will be healthier! DON'T LET THEM GET BORED! 
Variety is the Spice of Life!!<br>

 In the beginning, watch your skunk for 
diarrhea after eating. If it occurs, remove the offending food from the diet.
<br> <br>
<b>FISH, FOWL AND MEATS</b><br>
 Chicken, turkey or any member of the 
fowl (bird) family may be given, but only if fully boiled or baked-never give 
raw!<br>
 Fish of any kind may be given boiled, baked or water-packed, such as 
canned tuna, salmon, oysters, shrimp or clams.<br>
 Deer, rabbit or any other 
game meats may be fed to skunks as long as it is fully cooked in some manner 
other than frying. NEVER ALLOW YOUR SKUNK TO EAT RAW MEATS OF ANY KIND. IT 
COULD BE DEADLY!!<br>
<br>
<b>SKUNK SIZES FROM 1 DAY TO 21 + YEARS</b><br>
 
Every skunk is different; however, here are some AVERAGE lengths, heights and 
weights. You should be able to judge if your skunk is too fat or too thin.<br>
 
At birth, a baby skunk is from 2 to 4 inches long and weighs between 1 and 3 
ounces. The measurements given are from the tip of the nose to the base of the 
tail. (Tail length is not included in overall body length.) Front and rear 
heights are measured from the floor to the shoulder and floor to the hip when 
the skunk is standing. The head is measured around the ears and under the jaw.
<br> FEMALE SKUNKS...................................MALE SKUNKS<br>
 4 weeks 
to 8 weeks.........................4 weeks to 8 weeks<br>
 LENGTH: 4 to 8 
inches......................LENGTH: 4 to 8 inches<br>
 FRONT LEG: 3 to 4 
in.......................FRONT LEG: 3 to 4 in<br>
 REAR LEG 4 to 5 
in.........................REAR LEG 4 to 5 in<br>
 WEIGHT: 1/2 to 2 
lbs.......................WEIGHT: 1/2 to 2 lbs<br>
 HEAD: 3 1/2 to 4 
in........................HEAD: 3 1/2 to 4 in<br>
<br>
 This is the time when 
the boys and the girls grow about the same rate and appear to always be the 
same size, however, if you have a male skunk and it does not grow or stops 
growing, except for the legs and tail, this is called the ugly skunk stage. 
Their body parts and pieces just don't match. They are too long for their legs 
or their legs are too tall for their bodies. They WILL even out and will not 
always and forever be so leggy and gawky. They will turn into a beautiful 
animal before your very eyes!<br>

 For all of you 
girl skunk owners, the baby has started to slow down and grow slower. For all 
of you boy skunk owners, well folks, one day this very large strange furry 
covered creature will be strolling in your house. Please, do not be alarmed, 
this is only your bouncing baby boy catching up with the girls.<br>
 You must 
remember that skunks genetic heritage differs as greatly as ours. Their 
parent's, grand-parent's and great grand-parent's genes have combined and 
recombined to give your skunk his skeletal structure.<br>
 We know of 2 male 
skunks, raised in the same home, both 4 years old, fed the same diet. One is 18 
inches long and 11 inches tall and weighs 11 1/2 pounds. The other is 10 inches 
long and 6 inches tall and weighs 5 pounds. Both are perfectly healthy. If 
those 2 skunks weighed the same thing, one of them would be in serious trouble! 
A human baby at birth can weigh 6 pounds and be 19 inches long, however, as an 
adult it be 7 feet tall and weigh 300 pounds. Use your eyes, your hands, a 
scale if necessary and your common sense to determine your skunk's proper 
weight for its size. Do not think that you have to love your skunk to death 
with food or treats that are not good for them or that you are starving the 
poor thing to death. This will not happen if you just look at the size of a 
very small animal and know that it will not need as much or more food than you 
do to stay alive.<br>
<br>
<b>GENERAL SKUNK CARE INFORMATION</b><br>
 LIVER 
PROBLEM PREVENTATIVE<br>
 Terramycin Soluble Powder, purchased at a Feed and 
Seed Store, is used by cattle and horse people, the chicken industry and mink 
breeders on a regular basis. It has great benefit for our skunk's livers, which 
is one of their weakest organs. Our vets have approved its usage for our skunks 
on a 3 month on--3 month off basis. The powder is mixed in their drinking water 
daily, using 1/2 teaspoon per gallon of water. (That breaks down to 1/4 
teaspoon to a 1/2 gallon or 1/8 teaspoon to 1 quart of water.) We have seen a 
tremendous decrease in liver problems since the inclusion of Terramycin. The 
medicated water MUST be changed every 24 hours!<br>
 Please keep in mind this 
is not a prescription drug, but one that can be purchased from your local feed 
and seed stores or pet shops. This is one of the old drugs and is seldom used 
in today's world of medicine. Advise your vet that you are using Terramycin if 
another drug is given to your skunk for any reason.<br>
<br>
<b>LIMPING</b><br>

 This could be an early warning sign of possible Arthritis, Degenerative Bone 
Disease or just a pulled muscle. Your skunk needs to be seen by a vet for 
x-rays as this is the only way to tell what is happening to your skunks' bones. 
Sorry, skunks do not have zippers to open up and take a look inside.<br>
 Until 
you can have x-rays taken of your skunk, give ONE HALF ONLY OF A BABY ASPIRIN 
ONCE A DAY. Too much aspirin can cause liver damage. DO NOT use Tylenol or any 
other Acetaminophen product, as it could kill your skunk. The safe way to take 
away pain is Jalapeno Peppers, and skunks think they are treats. This helps 
with the pain and swelling. Let your skunk swim in the tub with warm water just 
deep enough for the skunks' feet not to touch the bottom of the tub. 
Hydrotherapy benefits skunks, too! Raskey, my fifteen year old, hated baths 
until he became unable to walk. Now he beats me to the bathroom and bangs on 
the side of the tub with his paw for his daily swim.<br>
 Unless you know 
without a doubt that your skunk's limp comes from a pulled muscle while 
skydiving, have it x-rayed. If found early enough, most bone problems can be 
corrected before major problems occur.<br>
<br>
<b>SKUNK TEETH</b><br>
 If your 
skunk has bad breath, rubs its mouth on chairs, the wall or your foot, it 
probably has a tooth problem, either tartar on the teeth or a bad tooth. Your 
vet can either clean their teeth or remove the bad tooth and all is well. 
Non-fat dry milk used daily along with Vitamin C will help prevent tooth 
problems and infections.<br>
<br>
<b>COUGHING AND SNEEZING</b><br>
 By this 
time you think you have taken on a child rather than a skunk and what you are 
about to read may surprise you! Just like us, skunks have allergies and sinus 
problems. Has anyone ever heard a wild skunk sneeze ? Ours do!<br>
 One half 
teaspoon of Robitussin will help with the coughing. You also may want to worm 
your skunk as coughing is one of the signs of round worms. One half tablet of a 
4 hour Chlor-trimeton tablet helps with the sneezing. However, this is only 
covering up what could really be a serious problem. Please have your skunk 
checked for any type of infections of the respiratory system. It is nice to 
know that your skunk only needs to be in a dust free area, or away from Pine or 
Oak Trees or inhale no more hair spray. If you really want to know which one, 
there are several tests that can be run on your skunk for about $1,500.00. The 
good news is-it does not matter which one they are allergic to, all allergies 
are treated the same, so save your money.<br>
 We have seen several cases of 
Pneumonia and Congestive Heart Failure that began with a cough. If a cough 
persists longer than 1 dose of medicine, take it to a vet immediately. Early 
treatment can avoid, correct or control many serious problems. Liquid Lasix and 
VasoTec or Endacard have been successful for Congestive Heart Failure, IF 
prescribed early and given religiously.<br>
<br>
<b>LEASH TRAINING</b><br>
 Use 
a Figure Eight cat harness if you wish to try walking your skunk. At first he 
will pull, tug and thrash around on it's back. Skunks are curious and will soon 
try to run off and see the world. Gently tug on the leash that you have chosen 
to use. Sometimes a trail of treats such as raisins placed in front will prompt 
him to go forward when asked to do so. In a while, you and your skunk can take 
long, enjoyable walks together if you are patient. If you do take your skunk to 
the outside world, which they really don't like anyway simply because it is not 
air conditioned or heated, and it is on the ground where it could be exposed to 
a rabid animal, keep in mind that at this time there is no Approved Rabies 
Vaccine for skunks. If a dog, cat, squirrel or cow bites your skunk, it could 
be infected with the Rabies Virus and this is sure death.<br>
<br>
<b>NAIL 
TRIMMING</b><br>
 Skunks use their nails for digging, not clawing - they are 
not sharp and will not puncture skin. However, their nails will grow very long 
and can cause damage to your carpets, walking problems and could be pulled out 
of the foot if they happen to get the nail caught in something if not trimmed 
periodically.<br>
 Skunks are very sensitive about their feet and nails. This 
could cause problems if you have not played with and fondled their feet from 
the beginning. Trim the nail about 1/4 inch below the pink tissue in the nail. 
Any further up and you could have a bleeding and very mad skunk!<br>
 If your 
skunk is not very co-operative during nail trimming, it could take 2 people to 
complete this task: 1. Wrap a towel or blanket around the arm not holding the 
skunk (for protection), hold the skunk by the back of the neck with the other 
hand. Move your wrapped arm near enough for the skunk to grasp the towel with 
its claws. They are now available for trimming.<br>
 2. Another trick that can 
work is to take a piece of heavy cardboard, cut a small half-moon off the edge 
of one side, place the cardboard under the skunk's jaw in front of his 
shoulders as you hold him by the back of the neck. The nails are free to be cut 
and its teeth can't reach the person helping you. At this time you may hear a 
very vocal skunk. He does not like being held immobile!<br>
 3. Try giving a 
large marshmallow, caramel candy or peanut butter kiss. Most skunks will hold 
it in their mouth and will not let go of the candy to bite you, however, there 
are those skunks who can inhale sweets before you can blink your eye.<br>
 Have 
Quick-Stop or household flour handy to control bleeding if a nail is trimmed 
too close to the quick.<br>
<br>
<b>BATHING</b><br>
 A skunk rarely needs a 
bath. If a skunk has an odor, it has a medical problem and a million baths will 
not solve the problem. (You may have forgotten to de-worm them this month.) If 
you do plan to bathe your skunk when it is an adult, especially after you 
remove the skunk from the fireplace, flowerpots, flour, sugar, soap powder or 
garbage cans, you should begin bathing it while it is a baby, but we do not 
recommend frequent bathing. Use a mild shampoo and hair conditioner. Nexus Hair 
Care Products are one of the best to use on skunks as they have all-natural 
ingredients. We use the same products on our skunks as we use on our hair. Do 
not use products for color treated hair or dandruff shampoos. If your skunk has 
fleas, use Scratch-X Shampoo for Fleas. Never use harsh shampoos or bleaching 
products. A DROP or two of Avon Skin-So-Soft in the rinse water may help to 
repel fleas. Bathing a skunk can be a trying experience or a fun-filled time as 
some skunks enjoy a dip in the old tub. Baths do not have to be traumatic to 
either of you. Fill the tub or sink with warm water and let the skunk play in 
it for a while. This enables the skunk's fur to become evenly soaked for better 
cleaning. Skunks can get a chill easily, so make sure you dry your skunk 
immediately with a towel or hair dryer set on low heat held 12 to 18 inches 
from the skunk's fur.<br>
 Dry shampoos do not work well on skunks. However, 
plain cornmeal works great! Start at the base of the tail and work the cornmeal 
down to the skin by brushing or rubbing forward on the skunk's hair and body, 
going all the way to the top of the head. The cornmeal will remove the oils and 
dirt in the skunk's coat, making it smell and look like a brand new skunk. This 
is a lot easier on you and your skunk than soap and water, but we do suggest 
that this be done OUTSIDE!<br>
<br>
<b>FLEAS</b><br>
 Use dips or sprays with 
the active ingredient Pyrethrins, such as Scratch-X or Sectrol by 3M. It is 
important to READ LABELS!!!<br>
 You can make a very effective flea treatment 
at home and make it very cheaply. Put 1 pint of rubbing alcohol and the rind 
only of 1 orange into your blender and blend it thoroughly. After the rind has 
been ground into extremely fine pieces, strain through a cloth and pour back 
into alcohol bottle. Use a piece of cotton or cloth to apply this mixture to 
your skunk's skin and fur. You could also put the mixture into a spray bottle 
and spray your skunk. They will smell delicious! The alcohol kills the fleas 
and the orange rind repels any new fleas. Orange rinds placed under your 
furniture or where your skunk sleeps helps not only to control fleas but it 
makes your house smell delightful. Caffeine sprays for flea control are now 
coming on the market and are safe for skunks.<br>
<br>
<b>PESTICIDES</b><br>
 
Skunks are very sensitive to all forms of pesticides, including those 
recommended for use on dogs. If you use a pest control company, advise the 
company to use caution in spraying, as poisoning can occur from a simple 
maintenance practice in your home. Combat Disks are safe and they work very 
well. Skunks with pesticide poisoning very rarely survive. If you suspect your 
skunk has a pesticide reaction, take it to the vet immediately.<br>
<br>
<b>
HOUSEHOLD CLEANING PRODUCTS</b><br>
 Some common household products are 
dangerous to skunks. Some have caused death. Use a solution of 1/4 cup 5% 
chlorine bleach to 1 gallon of water (a solution any stronger can cause damage 
to the eyes or lungs of your skunk), or Spic and Span for cleaning purposes. 
Earth Rite products are all-natural, environmentally safe and safe for animals. 
Some carpet fresheners and cleaners such as Glade Potpourri and Lysol products 
have killed dogs, cats and skunks, so be very careful with any cleaning 
products you use around your skunk.<br>
<br>
<b>DECLAWING SKUNKS</b><br>
 This 
surgery removes the entire joint of the toe. Skunks' claws are not like cat 
claws, but like our fingers and toes. Think about having your toes removed and 
you'll have a better understanding of what a skunk will have to endure if this 
INHUMANE surgery is performed on them. Their balance is affected, they can no 
longer hold their food and, in some way that we do not yet understand, it 
causes the liver to fail, leading to an early death. It is our feeling that if 
you cannot live with occasional digging in your carpets, which can be 
controlled--DO NOT GET A SKUNK! If you don't like to change diapers or get up a 
4 in the morning, do not get a baby. Declawed skunks are pitiful sights to 
behold hobbling along as if they were in pain, which they may be!<br>
<br>
<b>
FANG FILING OR REMOVAL</b><br>
 This procedure prevents the skunk from eating 
properly and causes the rest of the teeth to become misaligned and could cause 
dental problems later. Here again is one more reason why some people should not 
even try to live with a skunk. In our society, we change and make over our own 
bodies, so some people feel that if your skunk has something that you consider 
bad news, simply have it removed, no matter what problems or cruelty we impose 
on the skunk. WRONG!! Declawing and fang filing or removal is OUTRIGHT ABUSE!!!
<br> <br>
<b>RABIES</b><br>
 Pen raised, domestic skunks have been erroneously 
labeled as Rabies carriers. As long as your skunk comes from a reputable 
breeder, such as Ruby Fur Farms in New Sharon, Iowa, where no Rabies has been 
found since 1932, or your skunk has not been exposed to a rabid animal or the 
carcass of a rabid animal, Rabies should not be a problem. We have heard such 
stories as: &quot;All skunks are born with Rabies&quot;, &quot;Skunks are 
latent carriers of Rabies and could be years old before you know if they have 
Rabies&quot;, &quot;There is no known Rabies virus incubation period for 
skunks.&quot; The only conclusion one could come to on this subject is that all 
of the skunks born in 1932 on Mr. Ruby's Farm (there have been no case of 
Rabies since 1932 on this fur farm) must be alive and well and waiting to die 
with Rabies. I THINK NOT!!<br>
 There is no known incubation for skunks&quot;?? 
Strange thing...we have found a national publication on the incubation period 
of the Rabies virus in several animals including man. &quot;A carrier state 
(the ability of infected animals to transmit Rabies virus while incubating the 
disease) is known for some species. Cats, dogs, foxes and skunks (Mephitis 
Mephitis) can expose susceptible hosts in the United States to Rabies one, 
three and eight days, respectively, before onset of clinical illness.&quot; 
This is found in Rabies In Florida, by Burridge MJ, Sawyer LA and Bigler WJ, 
Table 2.1, which summarizes the incubation and morbidity periods for Rabies in 
animals and man. The quote was taken from a letter dated January 28, 1986, from 
Dr. Leigh Ann Sawyer, DVM, MPH, Veterinary Epidemiologist, Viral and 
Rickettsial Zoonoses Branch, Division of Viral Diseases, Center for Infectious 
Diseases, Center for Disease Control, Department of Health &amp; Human 
Services, Atlanta, Ga. We do not know why this information is being kept from 
skunk owners, but this seems to be another approach by the &quot;powers that 
be&quot; to controlling our lives.<br>
 At this time, there is no approved 
Rabies vaccine for skunks. You can use a KILLED FELINE VACCINE that is used for 
ferrets.<br>
 A SKUNK MUST NEVER BE GIVEN LIVE OR MODIFIED LIVE RABIES 
VACCINATIONS--THEY HAVE DEVELOPED RABIES FROM THESE VACCINES!!<br>
 Be very 
careful with your skunk! If it bites someone and they report it to the health 
authorities, you must surrender your skunk to be murdered and the brain cells 
tested for Rabies. Many people have tragically lost their cherished pet because 
it bit someone. Skunk owners are punished for not having &quot;suitable 
companion animals&quot; for pets, such as dogs or cats. Three years ago, there 
was a case in Georgia where an irresponsible skunk owner allowed his baby skunk 
to roam free in a fenced backyard. It was bitten by a rabid raccoon and soon 
became rabid. Upon Rabies confirmation, the State of Georgia hunted down all 
the baby skunks sold from the same store, terrorized 12 skunk owners with 
RABIES SCARE TACTICS into having their baby skunks murdered, mangled and 
serving the heads of the 12 baby skunks on a silver platter for Rabies testing. 
No one bothered to say &quot;I'm sorry or forgive me, I was wrong&quot; when 
ALL 12 Rabies tests came back NEGATIVE!! Welcome to the Wonderful World of 
Compassion and Understanding! No amount of words will stop the fear and terror 
the word RABIES brings to our hearts and minds, but just take a minute to 
think.. when someone says &quot;3 million skunks were found to have 
Rabies,&quot; ask how many domestic/pen raised skunks were in the 3 million 
rabid skunks. The answer will be, &quot;None, but...&quot;<br>
 Yes, your skunk 
will get Rabies if it is bitten by, or eats the carcass of a rabid animal; but 
then, --- so could you!!!<br>
<br>
<b>PREVIOUSLY OWNED SKUNKS</b><br>
 Some 
skunks don't change owners as easily as dogs or cats, but the change can be 
done with a reasonable amount of success. The age of the skunk is not a major 
factor in changing homes, but even the smallest babies have problems adjusting 
to new homes at first. Try to bring something that the skunk is used to, such 
as a blanket or favorite toy, to help reduce stress of &quot;newness.&quot; The 
skunk may choose to hide under a piece of furniture for several days. If this 
occurs, do not leave food out for the skunk while you are away, but rather, 
feed it while you are there so it can become used to you. Make sure it has 
fresh water at all times. New worlds need to be explored, so do not be alarmed 
if its nose goes into high gear and it checks out every inch of its new home.
<br> Offer the new skunk lots of healthy treats and good conversation. This 
allows your smell and voice to become familiar to the skunk and will build 
trust between the two of you. Any type of forced attention can lead to serious 
biting and distrust that may never be overcome. DO NOT FORCE A SKUNK TO COME TO 
YOU -- LET IT COME ON ITS OWN. Pet the skunk as it will willing accept and you 
will be friends for life.<br>
 Bad biters can be retrained with the use of 
simple tools--LOVE, gloves, boots and the trusty water bottle. The gloves and 
boots protect your body, the water bottle helps teach that biting is not nice 
and the LOVE makes it all work a lot faster. A lot of skunk owners have given 
up their animals because they bite, and if the animal has not been spayed or 
neutered, the biting will continue until it has been fixed. With LOVE AND 
PATIENCE, even &quot;Tasmanian Devils&quot; have been turned into lap babies.
<br> <br>
 JUST REMEMBER--A skunk in a new location is scared and unsure, just 
as you are in new places, around new people. You may even have to potty train 
all over again, so be prepared. PATIENCE AND LOVE will create a very loving 
animal. If you have any questions, just call or write us and we will be very 
glad to help in any way possible.<br>
 Please understand that we are not vets! 
Many skunk owners have learned many valuable lessons on how to deal with 
emergencies and everyday crises by using trial and error. Skunks died because 
vets were unreachable, but this happens less and less as we get more and more 
help and suggestions from skunk owners across the country. If you make a 
miraculous discovery that fixes a problem that your skunk develops, call one of 
us. Many skunks could profit by your discovery. PASS IT ON!!<br>
<br>
<b>FIRST 
AID UNTIL YOU CAN SEE THE VET</b><br>
 Skunks may develop problems at home when 
the vet is closed, but most of these problems can be handled by you. Some 
emergency vet services usually will not work with skunks, so contact the 
emergency service before leaving home, to determine their policy on domestic 
skunks.<br>
<br>
<b>DIARRHEA:</b><br>
 Pepto-Bismol aids this problem. Plan on 
wearing some of it. They don't like it! Feed well-cooked rice, baked or boiled 
potatoes, unset Jello, plain yogurt or Bene-Bac and give Gatorade or Pedialyte 
to help with fluid loss. Diarrhea is frequently caused by roundworms or bad 
diet. Have your skunk checked by the vet as soon as possible.<br>
<br>
<b>
RECTAL PROLAPSE</b><br>
 When this occurs, a portion of the intestine from 1/4 
to 2 inches long protrudes from the rectum. A prolapse is not as bad as it 
looks. The first one I ever saw caused me to replace my front door after I came 
back from the vet's office as I did not bother to open the door before going 
through it. The prolapse may be red or swollen and may not return immediately. 
Rinse with warm water, gently rub with Vaseline, Preparation H or Panalog 
(obtained from your vet) on the intestine while you slowly push small amounts 
of the intestine back into the rectum. It may take a while for the intestine to 
return to its normal place, but don't be alarmed if it seems to last forever. 
IT WILL EVENTUALLY GO BACK IN!! Unless your skunk is chewing at the tissue, it 
is not necessary to see a vet; however, if he is chewing at it, a vet must 
replace the intestine and possibly (we hope not, BECAUSE EVEN ONE TINY STITCH 
CAN DO NERVE DAMAGE IN THESE DELICATE TISSUES!) place a purse string stitch to 
hold it in place. Until the prolapse is completely gone, replace kitty litter 
with newspaper and keep the prolapse greased.<br>
 Rectal prolapse is caused by 
diarrhea, (one of the signs of round worms) and bad diet. Due to fluid loss, 
the intestine shrinks and the body can no longer hold the intestine in place. 
The intestine must be stretched back to full size to stay where it belongs. 
High fiber foods plus Fiber All or Metamucil added to the food will help the 
prolapse to go back inside and minimize intestinal irritation. It is not 
unusual for baby skunks to have a prolapse, they don't seem to know that it is 
abnormal and therefore don't bother it. Normally you will be able to push the 
intestine back into the body. In the rare case that improper descenting is the 
cause, Panalog Ointment should be used until healing takes place.<br>
<br>
<b>
FREQUENT URINATION</b><br>
 Unless your skunk is in heat, this may indicate 
kidney or bladder problems or Diabetes. Try giving as much cranberry, orange or 
tomato juices as it will drink or you can mix 1 teaspoon of white vinegar with 
1 quart of water and place it in the water bowl. If the problem persists, take 
the skunk to the vet.<br>
<br>
<b>BLEEDING</b><br>
 Clean site with mild soap 
and water. Use Quick Stop (from pet stores or your vet) or plain flour 
sprinkled over the bleeding area to control and stop bleeding. If your skunk 
has pulled a toe nail out, with lots of bleeding, you can place the foot in a 
cup, glass or small bowl of flour until bleeding stops.<br>
<br>
<b>UPSET 
STOMACH</b><br>
 Ground ginger sprinkled over food, Pepto-Bismol, Coke, ginger 
ale or any product for children will help here. Plain yogurt will aid in 
digestion and should solve a lot of future problems if fed to your skunk daily.
<br> <br>
<b>SEIZURES</b><br>
 We have had numerous reports of skunks having 
seizures--convulsions, drooling, rapid breathing, totally stiff body, wide open 
glazed eyes, and no response to stimuli. If your skunk experiences any of these 
symptoms, wrap it in something to keep it warm and from going into shock or 
harming itself or you. Sugar of some form must be fed to prevent severe 
hypoglycemia.<br>
 Dip a Q-Tip, pen, pencil, an infant ear syringe--anything 
but your fingers-into Karo syrup, pancake syrup, honey or sugar water and apply 
to the gums or tongue. DO NOT USE YOUR FINGERS as a convulsing animal may 
severely bite. When it appears to be coming out of the seizure, feed as much of 
the sweet as it will take. Gatorade after a seizure can save your skunks' life!
<br> A seizure may be caused by an allergic reaction, heat stress, round worms, 
epilepsy, diabetes, distemper, poisoning, liver problems or various other 
health problems. Seizures are a serious health situation and it must be 
diagnosed and treated IMMEDIATELY! Take your skunk to the vet as soon as 
possible!!<br>
<br>

<b>WARNINGS 
FOR AND ABOUT SKUNKS</b><br>
 Recliners have taken the lives of several skunks. 
Be very careful when using a recliner!! Your skunk could be under it without 
your knowing it! Be careful of heavy objects that could fall on your skunk, 
such as an iron from off an ironing board. Some skunks like to sleep in 
drawers. If a drawer seems stuck, be slow and careful about unjamming it. A 
baby skunk died of a broken neck just this way in 1993.<br>
 Skunks have been 
known to eat kittens, birds and other small animals, so please keep your other 
tiny pets out of &quot;Harms (SKUNKS) Way.&quot;<br>
 Some skunks have eaten 
Boas, Pythons and have come down with Salmonella. It took a very long time to 
treat and could have ended with a dead skunk.<br>
<br>
<b>SKUNK TRAVEL TIPS</b>
<br> Traveling with your skunk does not have to be a major problem. Taking 
their own carrier, familiar snugglies and a few favorite toys will make them 
more comfortable.<br>
 Chemical ice blocks that are used for coolers, wrapped 
in a towel and placed in the carrier will help them keep cool, as will a few 
frozen grapes now and then. Raisins soaked in Gatorade for 2 days before the 
trip may come in handy in a stress situation.<br>
 Cracker Jacks may also be 
given to ward off stress problems for your skunk. A RARE salty treat will 
stimulate your skunk to drink properly.<br>
 Take a cardboard box and fill it 
with newspaper for a portable bathroom for your skunk or you can place a 
plastic bag with newspaper covering it on the floor board held in place with 
masking tape.<br>
 Have cut up veggies with you for treats.<br>
<br>
<b>LET'S 
MAKE LIFE VERY SIMPLE</b><br>
 I still see pictures in my mind of the bushels 
of, boxes of, bag's of, bottles of skunk stuff that I would have to deal with 
daily, however, after a short while you begin to see that if you know what you 
are dealing with it is not so bad. Since the heavens opened up and Zip Lock 
Bags fell to earth, our lives are much simpler now!<br>
 I just take 5 or 6 
bags, throw in all the vitamins, dog food and anything else I can think of into 
each bag. On the day of or the night before little one's meal time I cut all 
the stuff they need, throw it in the bags along with the yogurt and cottage 
cheese. Now I am ready to instantly feed or snack for five or six days.<br>
 
Dog food can be placed in the freezer and you can take out a weeks worth at a 
time, keeping the dog food from getting old.<br>
 Use the cut off parts of the 
veggies you cook for yourself, for your skunk's dinner and they will love it. 
It is good for your pocketbook, too!<br>
 Shakers like salt or cheese shakers 
can be used for instant milk, powdered brewers yeast or baking soda.<br>
 Pills 
and skunks can be tricky. I crush the pill up, place it some cooking oil, 
peanut butter, mayonnaise, jelly or salad dressing. In other words, whatever 
your skunk likes, you can hide the crushed pill in.<br>
 For emergencies Karo 
Syrup or Pancake Syrup and Gatorade can be placed in a syringe or a small 
plastic squirt bottle. It is easier to handle in traveling, to store in the 
refrigerator and to use with your skunk.<br>
 Clear Contact Paper placed on the 
wall behind your skunks litter box will make clean up a lot easier.<br>
