Tips to the hotel staff, local guides and your safari guide.<br>
<br>
<b>Focus: 
</b>Birds, wildlife, culture and natural history of Kenya.</p> <br>

<p>The Great safari is a lodge and luxury tented camps based safari, covering 
all aspects of nature including watching both mammals and birds.<br>
<br>
We 
will visit totally different areas from Mount Kenya to Samburu &#150; north of 
equator with it&#146;s unique wildlife and bird life as well to the Great Rift 
valley lakes with great game viewing area, surrounded by yellow barked 
acacia&#146;s and the red clad Masai&#146;s people dotted across the plains. 
Vast herds of antelopes, zebra and prides of lions share their home with 
hundreds of birds species including the famous pink wash of flamingos across 
the Rift Valley lakes.<br>
<br>
<b>Day 1: JKIA / Nairobi. </b>Arrival in 
Nairobi where you will be met by Mbango Safaris tour leader and taken to your 
hotel to check-in and relax. In the afternoon (Depending on your arrival time), 
we visit the Natural History Museum of Nairobi for a guided tour to the museum.
<b>Overnight in Nairobi Serena Lodge.</b>&nbsp;<br>
</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> <br>
<br>
<br>

<p><b>Day 2: Samburu National Reserve. </b>Today we will leave the city and 
head towards north passing through the rich Kikuyu farm lands with good views 
of Mt.Kenya if the weather is clear. Upon arrival at Samburu National Park we 
shall drive to the lodge for check in followed by lunch. In the afternoon we 
shall venture out for a game viewing and birding in this park. Our target 
species to look out for since they are not easily found elsewhere includes 
Pringles Puff-back, Pale Prinia, Somali Long-billed Crombec and the endemic 
Donaldson Smith Weaver. Uncommon mammals of this park include the Grevy&#146;s 
Zebra, Giraffe necked antelope or Gerenuk, Reticulated Giraffe and the Beisa 
Oryx.<b>Overnight at Samburu Game Lodge.<br>
<br>
 Day 3: Samburu National 
Reserve.</b>Today we go further a field to locate more Somali arid region 
species; we shall be bird finding species like Somali Bee-eater, Pink-breasted 
Lark and with a lot of luck the William&#146;s Lark. Vulturine Guineafowl, 
Heuglin&#146;s Courser, Martial Eagle, Penduline Tit, Water Thicknee, Golden 
Palm Weaver, Grey-headed Bush-shrike, Pygmy Batis are other wonderful birds we 
will encounter. We shall also be on the lookout for the Bat Hawk which has been 
observed hunting around the river.<b>Overnight at Samburu Game Lodge. <br>
<br>

D</b><b>ays 4 &amp; 5: Lake Nakuru National Park. </b>Early breakfast we drive 
towards the highlands east of the Rift Valley; we will have a stopover at the 
spectacular Thompson&#146;s falls to enjoy the view while looking for the 
Slender-billed Starling. We will continue loosing altitude until we reach Lake 
Nakuru on the floor of the Rift Valley; here we will see the spectacular 
gathering of lesser Flamingoes in there hundreds of thousand together with an 
abundance of other water birds like the Western Reef Heron, Lesser Jacana, and 
Black-headed Gull. We will also look for the leopard at the acacia forest. Lake 
Nakuru is a soda lake and host to one of the great ornithological spectacles of 
the world. Hundreds of thousands of Lesser Flamingos (occasionally up to 2 
million) traditionally form a carpet of shimmering pink that stretches as far 
as the eye can see around the lake-shore. Pink-backed and White Pelicans swim 
in the shallows and feeding amongst them are Yellow-billed and Marabou Storks, 
Sacred Ibis, African Spoonbills, and an almost complete range of east African 
ducks, waders, terns and gulls. The piercing call of the African Fish Eagles is 
a familiar sound at Nakuru and just one of numerous birds of prey that patrol 
the park. Mammals too are plentiful, particularly Bohor Reedbuck, 
Waterbuck,Buffalo, Warthog and the rare Rothschild&#146;s Giraffe, whilst 
anyone tiring of the lakeside spectacle will find more than enough birds and 
other wildlife in the surrounding scrub and woodland. Nakuru National Parks is 
one of the better places in Africa to find Leopard and the park is also a very 
important Rhino sanctuary. It has a population of over 60 Black Rhino, although 
these are very hard to see, and ahealthy breeding population of White Rhino 
which includes a large number of young ones. Dinner and overnight for the two 
days at<b>Sarova Lion Hill Lodge, full board. <br>
<br>
Day 6: Kakamega Forest 
Reserve.</b>Today we have an early breakfast and leave the Rift Valley for the 
unique rainforest of Kakamega. Along the way we will have birding stops to 
locate more species and have astopover for lunch. Arrive in Kakamega in the 
late afternoon check in and immediately go for an evening bird walk, around the 
hotel grounds the following species are easily seen - Joyful Greenbul, 
Veillot&#146;s Black Weaver, Great Blue Turaco, Grey Throated Barbet, African 
Blue Flycatcher, White-chinned Prinia and Brown-throated Wattle-eye.<b>
Overnight at Rondo Retreat Center &#150; Kakamega forest.<br>
<br>
Day 7: 
Kakamega Forest.</b>Today we venture into the true forest to locate the much 
harder to see forest specialists, we shall lookout for the Brown Illadopsis, 
Black-billed Turaco, Blue-headed Bee-eater, Equatorial Akalat, Yellow-billed 
Barbet, Red-headed Bluebill, Barred Prinia, Ludher&#146;s Bushshrike, 
Bocages&#146;s Bush-shrike Yellowbill and Southern Hyliota among others.<br>

<br>On our way back to the hotel for lunch break, we shall bird the forest 
edges and species likely to be seen includes Chubb&#146;s Cisticola, 
Blue-shouldered Robin Chat Mackinnon&#146;s Fiscal, and Black-faced Rofous 
Warbler.<br>
<br>
After lunch we shall head back into a different part of the 
forest to locate more birds like Shelley&#146;s Greenbul, Pale Illadopsis, 
Chapin&#146;s flycatcher (hopefully) White Spotted Flufftail, African Broadbill 
and Yellow- whiskered Greenbul among others.<b>Overnight at Rondo Retreat 
Center &#150; Kakamega forest.<br>
<br>
Day 8: Maasai Mara National Reserve. 
</b>We start out early after breakfast to be able to make a few stops along the 
way to Masai Mara Reserve. Arriving at the gates of the world famous Maasai 
Mara National Reserve, where we shall slow down our pace considerably enjoying 
the wildlife and birdlife of Kenya 's top game reserve on the way to our 
comfortable lodge in the Mara, Mara Serena Lodge which is perched on a hill 
with good views of the Mara plains below. Here we will be based for two nights.
<br><br>
The Masai Mara Game Reserve is probably the most famous in all of 
frica. It is raising grassland, watered by the Mara River and covering an area 
of 1,510 square kilometres. The Mara region has been inhabited by humans for at 
least 2,000 years, the last 200 years by the Masai. The area is part of what is 
now referred to as the Serengeti - Mara Ecosystem, being joined to the huge 
Serengeti National Park in Tanzania. In the local (Maa) language Mara means 
'spotted', a reference to the patches of bush and trees that dot the plains. 
The Masai Mara holds some of the largest concentrations of animals in the 
world, especially in August when huge herds of White-bearded Wildebeest and 
Burchell's Zebra, pursued by their attendant predators, migrate into the 
reserve from the adjacent Serengeti. This is another of Africa's great wildlife 
spectacles and, whilst nothing is certain in the world of wildlife watching, we 
hope to have timed it just right and witness the breathtaking sight of the Mara 
grasslands filled as far as the eye can see with huge herds of Wildebeest and 
Zebras (October safari). Topi, Coke's Hartebeest, Impala, Eland, Thompson's and 
Grant's Gazelles, Bohor Reedbuck, Bushbuck, Kirk's Dik-dik, Masai Giraffe, 
Elephant and Buffalo feed amongst them stalked by all 3 big cats, Lion, Cheetah 
and Leopard, along with a variety of other predators and scavengers such as 
Bat-eared Fox, Serval, Spotted Hyena and Black-backed Jackals. The birdlife is 
equally diverse, although often takes second place to the spectacle of the 
mammals. Huge Ground Hornbills and elegant secretary Birds stride across the 
grasslands along with Kori Bustards, Grey Crowned Crane and smaller species 
such as Temminck's Coursers, Wattled Lapwing, Rosy-breasted Longclaw, 
Yellow-shouldered Widowbird and Capped Wheatear. Lone bushes or dead trees 
provide lookout perches for a variety of beeeaters and rollers, including the 
beautiful Carmine Bee-eater, whilst above them soar Martial Eagles, 
Lappet-faced, African White-backed, Hooded and Ruppell's Vultures, the latter 
four always on the look out for a recent kill. In the camp grounds and acacia 
woodlands we should find a plethora of barbets, finches, weavers, 
Turaco&#146;s, go-away-birds, glossy starlings and kingfishers.<br>
<br>
Our 
days in the Mara will start with an early morning wake up call, and a cup of 
tea or coffee, before we head out onto the plains shortly after dawn. After 
enjoying the animals and birds we will return to camp late morning for lunch 
before heading out again for the afternoon game drive. There are additional 
activities on offer for those who wish, the most popular being a hot air 
balloon ride - a truly magical experience. The cost of hot air ballon is not 
included in the tour cost and must be booked in advance. Please contact the 
Mbango Safaris office for a price and more information.<b>Overnight at Mara 
Serena Lodge - Maasai Mara.</b><br>
</p> <br>

<p></p> 
<p><b>Day 9 - 11: Maasai Mara National Reserve. &nbsp;</b>Maasai Mara is 
famous for its abundant wildlife and is always a highlight on any itinerary. In 
this respect, you will not be disappointed, while driving within the reserve 
birding, we shall see animal like Lion, Cheetah, Wildebeest, hartebeests, Topi, 
Thompson&#146;s and Grant&#146;s Gazelles Hyenas, Black-backed Jackals among 
others. Bird watching here will be delightful and highlights should include 
Temminck&#146;s Courser, Yellow-throated Sand-grouse and with luck 
Black-bellied Bustard.<b>Overnight at Mara Serena Lodge - Maasai Mara. <br>
<br>
Day 12: Lake Naivasha.</b>Today we leave the Maasai Mara for LakeNaivasha 
Arriving at the shores of Lake Naivasha for a late lunch. Lake Naivasha is 
famous for its large number of water birds. We are going to be staying 
atElsamereFieldStudy Center at the banks of Lake Naivasha: Elsamere is the 
former home of Joy Adamson who, together with her husband George, became world 
famous for the pioneering conservation work and relationship with the Lioness 
Elsa.<br>
</p> <br>
<br>
<br>

<p> <b>D</b><b>ays 13 &amp; 14: Amboseli National Park. </b>After breakfast we 
will drive to Amboseli National Park stopping for lunch at the famous Carnivore 
restaurant in Nairobi. Amboseli sits beneath the towering snow-capped peak of 
Mount Kilimanjaro, Africa's highest mountain, and is one of the country's most 
scenic reserves. Its acacia-dotted plains and dry rolling grasslands support a 
wealth of game including plenty of Elephant, Masai Giraffe, Burchell's Zebra, 
Cape buffalo and Waterbuck. Indeed it is here (weather and dust permitting) 
that we hope to see that classic East African scene of Elephants and Giraffes 
striding across the plains backed by the snowy peak of Kilimanjaro; this is one 
of Kenya's most sought after photographic destinations so bring plenty of film 
(or memory cards!). Other mammals to look out for include White-bearded 
Wildebeest, Thompson's Gazelle, Warthog, Black Rhino and Spotted Hyena. 
Predators such as Cheetah and Lion do occur in Amboseli but are somewhat wary 
as they are still persecuted by the surrounding farmers. Birdlife is once again 
abundant and we will no doubt find a wide selection of the 400 species that 
have been recorded here. Some to look out for include Bateleur, Red-billed 
Hornbill, Greater Blue-eared Glossy Starling, Taccazze Sunbird, Bare-faced 
Go-away Bird, Diederic and Black Cuckoos and White-fronted Beeeater. We will 
explore Amboseli on morning and afternoon game drives from the Amboseli Serena 
Lodge, our base for the next two nights of the tour.<b>Overnight at Amboseli 
Serena Lodge - Amboseli.</b> <br>
<br>
<b>Days 15 &amp; 16: Tsavo West National 
Park.</b>This morning we will drive to Tsavo West National Park in a convoy, 
arriving in time for lunch. We will then check into the luxurious Kilanguni 
Serena Lodge, our base for the next two nights of the tour. Tsavo West, when 
combined with Tsavo East, covers over 20,000 square kilometers creating one of 
Africa's largest conservation areas. This is a classic East African park 
watched over by the distant snow-capped peak of Mount Kilimanjaro. Tsavo is a 
place of wide horizons and undulating acacia covered red earth plains dotted 
with graceful parties of Giraffes and herds of Elephant and Zebra. It is cut by 
only two permanent rivers and so has a more arid feel to it than the other 
reserves we will be visiting on the holiday, but is nevertheless a wonderful 
area for mammals, birds and other wildlife.<br>
<br>
Tsavo is also home to the 
Ngulia Rhino Sanctuary. The decline of the Eastern Black Rhinoceros has been 
both rapid and shocking and, not too long ago, there was a real fear that this 
amazing animal may become extinct. For example, in the 1970s the Tsavo 
ecosystem alone supported an estimated 6,000 to 8,000 Rhino, but by 1989 
poaching had reduced this to a mere 20 individuals! Today, an estimated 540 
Eastern Black Rhinoceros remain in the world and 85% of these are to be found 
in Kenya. The Ngulia Rhino Sanctuary has played an important role in the 
advancement of this work and helped develop many of the monitoring and 
conservation methods now employed in other parts of the country. The sanctuary 
itself was established in 1985 and protected 3 Rhino in an area of less than 1 
square mile. Today Ngulia Sanctuary covers 38 square miles (62 square 
kilometers) and is home to 57 Rhino, more than half of which were born there. 
This has been a fantastic success story and Rhino numbers continue to grow.<br>

</p> <br>

<p> During our stay in Tsavo we will visit the Ngulia Rhino Sanctuary to try 
and find one or two of the Rhino that live here, as well as a host of colourful 
birds such as Lilac-breasted Roller, Superb Starling and Beautiful Sunbird. We 
will also head out on game drives into Tsavo West National Park itself to enjoy 
the wealth of mammals, birds and other wildlife that abounds here.<br>
<br>

Tsavo is home to Kenya's 'red' Elephants and herds of these red-earth dusted 
giants are a familiar sight, along with Impala, Thompson's Gazelle, Masai 
Giraffe, Buffalo and perhaps even our first Lion or Cheetah. Indeed, the Lions 
of Tsavo are descendants of the legendary man-eaters (the Ghost and the 
Darkness) who brought the building of the Nairobi to Mombassa railroad to a 
standstill at the beginning of the last century. Friendlier inhabitants, 
however, include a wealth of birdlife - an amazing 600 species have been 
recorded here - including Ostrich, Kori Bustard, Saddle-billed Stork, 
Black-breasted Snake-eagle, Magpie Shrike, Carmine Beeeater, Woodland 
Kingfisher, Scarlet-chested Sunbird and many many more. Other, less frequently 
seen mammals include Gerenuk, Fringe-eared Oryx, Hunters Hartebeest and Leopard.
<br></p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> <br>
<br>
<br>

<p> An undoubted highlight of our stay at Tsavo will be the opportunity to 
visit the crystal clear waters of the Mzima Springs. Here underground spring 
water, filtered by the volcanic rock of the Chyulu Hills, has formed a series 
of forest-fringed freshwater pools into which an underwater glass observation 
tank has been built. From this uniquely aquatic viewpoint we can watch Hippos 
swimming underwater along with crocodiles and various fish.<b>Lunch, dinner and 
overnight for the two days at Kilanguni Serena Lodge.<br>
<br>
Days 17 - 19: 
Arabuko Sokoke Forest &#150; Malindi.</b>After an early breakfast we shall head 
down to the coastal part of Kenya. Our destination is Arabuko Sokoke forest. 
Here we hope to locate the rarer species like Amani Sunbird, Sokoke Scops Owl, 
Sokoke Pipit and Clarkes Weaver. More common species we should see includes 
Green Barbet, Black-bellied Starling, and Fischer&#146;s Turaco, East Coast 
Akalat, Eastern Nicator, Chestnut-fronted and Retz&#146;s Helmet shrikes.<br>

<br><b>Spend three nights at Turtle Bay Resort</b><i>. </i>Accommodation is in 
a beach hotel. Your stay is on a full board basis including scheduled 
activities. Activities include scuba diving, snorkelling, and kayaking, salt 
water fly-fishing and windsurfing.<br>
<br>
<b>Days 20 &amp; 21: Tsavo East 
National Park.</b>This morning we will drive to Tsavo East National Park, 
arriving in time for lunch. We will then check into the Man-eaters Tented camp, 
our base for the next two nights of the tour. Tsavo East, when combined with 
Tsavo West, covers over 20,000 square kilometers creating one of Africa's 
largest conservation areas. This is a classic East African park watched over by 
the distant Yatta Plateau. Tsavo is a place of wide horizons and undulating 
acacia covered red earth plains dotted with graceful parties of Giraffes and 
herds of Elephant and Zebra. It is cut by only two permanent rivers and so has 
a more arid feel to it than the other reserves we will be visiting on the 
holiday, but is nevertheless a wonderful area for mammals, birds and other 
wildlife.<b>Lunch, dinner and overnight for the two days at Aruba Lodge.<br>

<br>Day 22: Nairobi. </b>Sadly, today we have to leave Tsavo which has been our 
home and wildlife theatre for the last two days for a return drive to Nairobi 
we are going to make our way to the airport for our outbound flight back home.
<br><br>
<b>Food &amp; accommodation included in the price. </b>All meals and 
accommodation are included throughout this holiday, with the exception of 
dinner on the first day at Nairobi Serena Lodge.<br>
<br>
<b>Client Comments:
</b><br>
<br>
&quot;A superb tour which fully lived up to expectations. I saw 
470 bird species and mammal sightings included 16 cheetahs, 10 Black Rhino, 
Lions galore and 1m+ Wildebeests. Timing of the tour was perfect, coinciding 
with incredible numbers of animals in Masai Mara. The guides were really 
excellent.&quot; D.Mike.<br>
<br>
 &quot;This holiday was more than I expected 
and thoroughly enjoyed. I would recommend it to anyone who was visiting Africa 
for the first time and who wanted to meet such friendly people.&quot; J.Yankees.
<br> <br>
 &quot;Peter was a brilliant guide - and I have very high 
expectations! The driver guides are a real credit - they were excellent! 
Nothing was too much trouble. The whole trip was a wonderful experience! Thank 
you for enabling me to have the opportunity of sharing in it!&quot; Susie Miks.
<br> <br>
&quot;This is the 3rd successive trip we have taken with Mbango 
Safaris and each has been excellent in its own way. The holiday fulfilled our 
wish-list for birds so we were very happy with our choice. We really had an 
exceptional holiday and enjoyed wonderful scenery and bird life - I am sure we 
will be using Mbango Safaris again in the near future!&quot; Dibbie.<br>
<br>

&quot;Peter, as a guide was brilliant, as well as being very good 
company.&quot; Cornwall.<br>
<br>
 &quot;We had some truly amazing sightings 
and views of most wildlife and the whole experience was far beyond my 
expectations.&quot; S.R., Cambridgeshire.<br>
<br>
 &quot;We believe Peter 
Kamau is one of the best natural history tour guides we have met. His knowledge 
of wildlife was extensive and he helped everyone to spot as many different 
species as possible...We greatly enjoyed seeing such a wide variety of mammals 
and birds in Kenya and we intend in due course to travel again with Mbango 
Safaris.&quot; J and J G., Devon.&quot;Having Peter as tour guide was an asset, 
his knowledge of birds and wildlife made the holiday so enjoyable. He ensured 
that the entire group saw whatever had been spotted. His sense of humour made 
it all the better. We saw so many beautiful sightings. I had tears in my eyes 
seeing and hearing a mother Cheetah calling her young baby, eventually she went 
to find her baby and brought it to the kill. Magical. The driver guides were 
marvellous drivers and guides. We nick-named Peter Eagle-eyes, always with an 
eye open to tell us of a bird or animal that we could easily have missed as 
they are well camouflaged. My friend and I both say it was one of our best 
holidays for birds and animals. The group that we were with seemed to get on 
well together. It was a really memorable holiday: I would love to go again. I 
am sure that my friend and travelling companion S.J. sends her thanks and best 
wishes too.&quot; B.G., Wales<br>
<br>
<b>Grading: </b>This tour is a tented 
camps and lodge based Kenya wildlife safari. Please remember that, in the game 
parks of east Africa, it is generally not permitted for visitors to leave the 
safety of their vehicles, apart from in our lodge grounds, meaning that 
we&#146;ll spend quite a lot of time in the comfortable safari vehicles! It is, 
though, the only way to see Kenya&#146;s unrivalled wildlife and every 
participant will enjoy a window seat.<br>
</p> <br>

<p></p> 
<p> <b>Weather. </b>During our tour we can expect most days to be dry and 
fairly sunny, temperatures ranging from 20- 30oC, depending on altitude. 
Overcast weather, particularly in the afternoons, may not be infrequent, but 
rain is unlikely except on high ground such as Kakamega Forest where afternoon 
precipitation is a possibility. The weather can be chilly between sunset and 
sunrise in June and October.<br>
<br>
<b>Entry requirements: </b>All European 
countries passport holders and most other nationalities requirea visa for Kenya 
which is obtained in advance from the nearest embassy or on arrival at the 
airport. You will also need to have various vaccinations and take malaria 
prophylactic. Please consult the nearest embassy about your requirements as 
soon as possible before traveling.<br>
