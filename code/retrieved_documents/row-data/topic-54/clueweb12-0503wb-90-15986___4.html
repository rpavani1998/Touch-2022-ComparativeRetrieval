Shrubs ... <br>
<br>
Bougainvillea; Puka na wila <br>
<em>
Bougainvillea spectabilis</em><br>
 Family: Nyctaginaceae <br>
 This is a 
colorful bougainvillea grown throughout Hawaii. The color is one of many hybrid 
varieties developed locally from a purple species native to Brazil. The genus 
was named in honor of French navigator Louis A. deBougainville who discovered 
the plant. This plant is a woody vine, which can become very aggressive in 
growth if not controlled. The colored petals of the &quot;flower&quot; are not 
part of the actual flower but are modified leaves, which surround the true 
flower, which is small, inconspicuous, and white to yellow colored.<br>
<br>

<br> Calliandra; Powder-puff; Lehua-haole <br>
<em>Calliandra inaequilatera 
</em><br>
 Family: Leguminosae <br>
 Subfamily: Mimosoideae <br>
 The Hawaiian 
name describes the flower and the plant's introduction to Hawaii. The flowers 
resemble the blossom of the lehua and the plants were introduced by the white 
man. This plant is a native of Bolivia and is considered a shrub; however, it 
can attain the size of a small tree. Several other species are also grown 
ornamentally in Hawaii but differ in blossom size and color.<br>
<br>
Crown 
Flower; <br>
Indian Milkweed; Pua-kalaunu <br>
<em>Calotropis gigantea </em><br>
 Family: Asclepediaceae <br>
 The mauve flower was a favorite with Queen 
Liliuokalani. This native of India is used for leis strung either with the 
whole flower or with the crown only. This milkweed is also a favorite of the 
monarch butterfly who sips the nectar and uses it as host plant for its 
caterpillars.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
 Kauai White Hibiscus; Koki`o ke`oke`o 
<br> <em>Hibiscus waimeae</em> subsp. <em>waimeae</em> <br>
 Family: Malvaceae 
<br> Native to Kauai, this hibiscus is commonly found in Waimea Canyon, and in 
the moist forests of the western and northern coasts of that island at 
800&rsquo; to 3900&rsquo; elevation. This hibiscus has fairly large white 
pinwheel shaped flowers that have a sweet fragrance. The staminal column is 
light green to magenta with magenta filaments. Leaves are ovate shaped and have 
tiny hairs on both sides. In cultivation the flowers bloom almost continuously 
and are born towards the ends of branches. Like all hibiscus, the flowers last 
only for a day. These bloom white in the morning, and turn pink as they fade in 
the afternoon. It prefers filtered shade in moist but well drained soils, but 
can survive in full sun with care. This shrub may grow into a 24&rsquo;- 
30&rsquo; evergreen tree.<br>

<br>
 Native White Hibiscus; 
Koki`o kea <br>
<em>Hibiscus arnottianus</em> subsp. <em>punaluuensis </em><br>

 Family: Malvaceae <br>
 This is a photo of a plant at the zoo native to the 
Big Island, and is similar to the better known O`ahu native that has 
4&rdquo;-10&rdquo; leaves. This evergreen plants&rsquo; oval shaped leaves have 
a smooth upper surface with blunt toothed edges, red veins and stems. The 
fragrant large white flowers have slightly ruffled edges, and a pink to red 
staminal column with red filaments. Prefers filtered shade in moist well 
drained soils but will tolerate full sun and drier conditions. This evergreen 
may grow into a 30&rsquo; tree but is usually a 15&rsquo;-20&rsquo; shrub with 
a similar diameter.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Native Yellow Hibiscus; <br>
Pua Aloalo; 
Ma`o hau hele<br>
<em>Hibiscus brackenridgei</em> <br>
 subsp. <em>brackenridgei
</em><br>
 Family: Malvaceae <br>
 This endangered species was designated as 
the Hawaii State flower in 1988. It is a shrubby type of plant found in drier 
areas on all the main islands except Ni`ihau and Ka-ho`olawe. Although flower 
color is the most obvious distinction in these hibiscus species, notice the 
equally distinct differences in leaf shape. These leaves are palmate and look 
like maple leaves, with tiny hairs on both sides. There are two subspecies: 
brackenridgei is native to the Big Island, Maui, Molokai and Lanai with yellow 
leaf veins and no spines on branches; mokuleianus is native to O`ahu and Kauai 
with tiny spines on the branches and leaves with pink veins. They do well in 
full sun and are drought tolerant. The bright yellow flowers bloom on a 
flowering stalk that rises above the plant. It is a fast grower and may bloom 
semi-annually for about 2 months. The plants at the zoo are native to the Big 
Island.<br>
<br>
Native Red Hibiscus; Koki`o `ula`ula <br>
<em>Hibiscus kokio 
</em><br>
 Family: Malvaceae <br>
 This hibiscus is native to the wet forests 
of O`ahu, Kauai and the Big Island. It was designated as the Hawaii State 
flower in 1923 and remained so until 1988 when it was replaced by the native 
yellow. The oval leaf has rounded tooth edges and a waxy surface. The 3&quot;- 
4&rdquo; red flower is pinwheel shaped with a red staminal column and red 
filaments that contrast with the yellow pollen. This flower was used by 
Hawaiians to make a light red dye. It will bloom best if planted in full sun. 
The plants at the zoo are native to the Big Island.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Mamaki <br>
<em>Pipturus albidus </em><br>
 Family: Urticaceae <br>
 This 
native Hawaiian fiber bush lacks the stinging hairs of other nettle family 
members. Caterpillars of the Kamehameha butterfly eat the red veined leaves. 
Bark was used to make poor grade tapa and medicine, and leaves for herb tea. 
The fruits are an unusual white mass with seeds on the surface like 
strawberries, and have a mild laxative effect. <br>
<br>
Purple Allamanda <br>

Family: Apocynaceae <br>
 This shrubby climber is an Allamanda hybrid or 
selection of unknown origin with large ( 4&rdquo;-6&rdquo;) deep purple 
flowers. There is a more common selection known as Allamanda &quot;Cherries 
Jubilee&quot; which has lighter purple flowers with yellow in the throat. 
Allamandas come from tropical South America.<br>
<br>
 Allamanda blanchetii (A. 
violacea is an old synonym of this species) flowers are similar in color to 
&quot;Cherries Jubilee&quot; but they are about 2/3 the size of the hybrid. It 
has long been thought that A. &quot;Cherries Jubilee&quot; might be a hybrid of 
A. blanchetii and A. cathartica though no one has been able to remake the cross.
<br> <br>
 Allamanda is in the Apocynaceae family which includes Plumeria, 
Carissa, Ochrosia, Adenium, Mandevilla, Nerium oleander, Thevetia and others. 
All plants with milky sap like these (also typical of the Euphorbia family) are 
potentially toxic - though a few, like Carissa, are not. You can identify this 
family easily by the trumpet-shaped flowers that have radially symmetrical 
lobes that are usually twisted like little propeller blades as well as the 
milky sap. Allamandas have smooth margined leaves in opposite pairs or whorls.

<br> Snow Bush; Lau-kalakoa <br>
<em>Breynia nivosa</em> var. roseo-picta <br>
 
Family: Euphorbiaceae <br>
 Native to the south Pacific islands, this plant is 
monoecious in that both male and female flowers are found on the same plant. 
The leaf color can be variegated in shades of white, pink, maroon, and green 
that is enhanced when planted in full sunlight. It is commonly used as a hedge 
plant but it has an extensive and aggressive root system. A sizeable stand of 
these plants can be formed as new plants arise from the suckering of the roots.

Vireya; 
Tropical Rhododendron <br>
Family: Rhododendron <br>
 Vireya are rhododendrons, 
semi-tropical rhododendrons. They grow mostly in the mountainous regions of 
Malaysia centered in and around the Equatorial zone including Indonesia, the 
Philippines, Borneo and Papua New Guinea. Of the 850 or so species that make up 
the genus Rhododendron, almost 300 are classified as vireya.<br>
<br>
 In their 
homelands, vireya can be found growing as epiphytes in the moss-encrusted lofts 
of tree branches, on rocks, or just growing as terrestrials, on the ground. 
They grow on the edges of forests and in open grasslands, seeking light. They 
are often the first plants to colonize areas where the original vegetation has 
been destroyed.<br>
<br>
 Vireya come in a variety of shapes and sizes ranging 
from dwarf mats at high altitudes to all sizes of shrubs, and even trees. Some 
have foliage that could be mistaken for pine needles; some have huge leaf 
blades a foot long with flowers to match. Their flowers are often fragrant and 
are the most colorful of all rhododendrons. Vibrant yellows and reds are 
common. Flower shapes vary from small, open cups to spidery clusters of long 
tubes.<br>
<br>
 On the Big Island, vireya hybrids exist in gardens from 
4,000-foot elevation down to sea level. It helps to think of them as orchids, 
with similar needs such as drainage and good air circulation.<br>
<br>
 Vireya 
have very fine surface roots, as opposed to a tap root. The most important 
factor in planting is excellent drainage important. Vireya do not like soggy 
feet, as they can develop root rot. Raised beds or mound plantings work the 
best. Because vireya roots run close to the surface, they can heat up from the 
sun. Covering with several inches of coarse mulch will keep them cool.<br>
<br>

 Bright light helps to set buds as well as shortening stem internodes. Though 
vireya love light, dappled light is recommended especially during our peak 
summer heat. Planting vireya under hapu`u (tree ferns), or near other plantings 
will give some shade. This will help prevent leaf burn and faded out flowers. 
Though there are varieties that will take full sun, they do equally well under 
dappled light.<br>
<br>
 Pinching off new growth promotes more branching as 
will deheading the seedpods, which will put the energy back into new growth and 
bud development rather than into seed production. Fertilizing should be very 
light. Lacewing insects can be a problem leaving silver spots covering the 
leaves.<br>
<br>
 Vireya can be easily rooted from cuttings. Some vireya, 
depending on the variety, can take as long as a year to root, though the 
average time is closer to three months. Vireya can also be grown from seed. A 
single seed pod can contain as many as several hundred seeds. But it may take 
three to eight years, depending on the variety, before flowering begins, 
whereas from cuttings that time is cut in half.<br>
<br>
 In the past few years 
the number of vireya hybrids coming into the islands has greatly increased. One 
reason for this is the Hawai`i Chapter ARS. Last year more than 75 new 
varieties were brought in from Australia. Networking with others in California 
has also brought in new hybrids.<br>

Wild Poinsettia; <br>
Chaconia; Pride 
of Trinidad<br>
<em>Warscewiczia coccinea </em><br>
 Family: Rubiaceae <br>
 A 
native of tropical America, this shrub produces large sprays of showy red 
sepals with tiny yellow flowers. It is the national flower of Trinidad &amp; 
Tobago. <br>
