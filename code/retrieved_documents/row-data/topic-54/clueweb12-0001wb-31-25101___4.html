<h1>GOOSEBERRY</h1> 
<h2><i>Ribes</i> spp.</h2> 
<h2><i>Saxifragaceae</i></h2> <b>Common Names:</b> Gooseberry (English), 
Stachelbeere (German), Groseille a Maquereaux (French), Uva Spina (Italian), 
Stekbes (Flemish).
<p> <b>Species:</b> American Gooseberry (<i>Ribes hirtellum</i>), European 
Gooseberry (<i>R. grossularia</i>). </p> 
<p> <b>Related Species:</b> Currant (<i>Ribes rubrum</i>, <i>R. petraeum</i>, 
<i>R. sativum</i>), Black Currant (<i>R. nigrum</i>, <i>R. ussuriense</i>), 
Buffalo Currant (<i>R. aureum</i>). </p> 
<p> <b>Origin:</b> Gooseberries are derived mostly from two species: the 
European gooseberry (<i>Ribes grossularia</i>), native to the Caucasus 
Mountains and North Africa; and the American gooseberry (<i>R. hirtellum</i>), 
native to northeastern and north-central United States and adjacent parts of 
Canada. So-called European cultivars are pure species, but virtually all 
so-call American cultivars also have European genes.</p> 
<p> <b>Adaptation:</b> Gooseberries grow best in summer humid, cool regions 
with great winter chilling. In California they are fairly productive in the 
coolest parts of the San Francisco Bay Area, the outer Coast Ranges and coastal 
northern California. They are probably not worth trying in southern California. 
except at high elevations. With proper attention gooseberries can be grown in 
containers.</p> 
<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2> <b>Growth Habit:</b> Gooseberries are deciduous shrubs, 
fast growing under optimum conditions to 3&nbsp;feet tall and 6&nbsp;feet wide. 
The plant is suitable for training as a standard. American types have weeping 
stems that will root wherever they touch the ground and can be invasive. Annual 
growth is in a single flush in spring. The roots are superficial, fine and 
easily damaged by frequent cultivation.
<p> <b>Foliage:</b> The buds perk up early in the spring, dotting the stems 
with green when most other plants are still tawny. The leaves are alternate, 
single, deeply lobed, and glossy dark green (European types), or pale to 
gray-green and sometimes finely pubescent (American types). The stems are thin, 
becoming woody, with a large thorn at each axil. American gooseberry stems are 
densely bristly, with one or more additional thorns at each axil. Leaf size and 
number are reduced under heat or light stress, and are easily burned by intense 
sunlight. Plants that have been subject to drought may make a new growth flush 
after deep irrigation. If the roots are lost, regrowth will wait until the 
following spring.</p> 
<p> <b>Flowers:</b> The inconspicuous flowers, green with pink flushed petals, 
open in early spring. They are borne laterally on one-year old wood and on 
short spurs of older wood. The flowers are self-fertile and pollinated by wind 
and insects, including bees. Each flower bud opens to yield from one to four 
flowers, depending on cultivar.</p> 
<p> <b>Fruit:</b> The fruit, borne singly or in pairs at the axils, is a berry 
with many minute seeds at the center. A gooseberry may be green, white 
(gray-green), yellow, or shades of red from pink to purple to almost black. 
Fruits of the European gooseberry may be very large, like a small plum, but are 
usually 1&nbsp;inch long, less in width. American gooseberry fruits are smaller 
(to 1/2&nbsp;inch), perfectly round, all becoming pink to wine-red at maturity. 
Skin color is most intense in full sunlight. Berries generally drop when 
overripe. The fruit has a flavor all its own, the best dessert cultivars as 
luscious as the best apple, strawberry or grape.</p> 
<h2>CULTURE</h2> <b>Location:</b> Gooseberries like morning sun, afternoon 
part-shade and buoyant air circulation. They are most productive in full 
sunlight but the leaves sunburn easily under California conditions. They can be 
grown in the high shade of fruit trees such as persimmon or on the north side 
of buildings. American gooseberry are much more sun tolerant. Plants collapse 
quickly when soil or air temperature exceeds 85&deg;&nbsp;F.
<p> <b>Soil:</b> Gooseberry plants are less finicky about soil acidity than 
most other small fruits, and tolerate a wide range of soils, except those that 
are waterlogged. Where summers are hot, bushes will grow better and produce 
better fruit in heavier soils, which retain more moisture and stay cooler. A 
thick mulch of some organic material also helps keep the soil cool. Sandy soils 
are less suitable for gooseberries because they dry out too fast.</p> 
<p> <b>Irrigation:</b> With their fibrous, shallow roots gooseberries are 
ideal for drip system. Keep the plants watered all season, since they will not 
regenerate buds or leaves lost from drought stress. Plants stressed for water 
are susceptible to mildew.</p> 
<p> <b>Fertilization:</b> Gooseberries have a high requirement for potassium 
and a moderate need for nitrogen, although excessive amounts of nitrogen 
promote disease, especially mildew. Between four and eight ounces of actual 
nitrogen per square yard strikes a good balance between growth and disease 
tolerance. The symptom of potassium deficiency is scorching of leaf margins. 
Deficiency can be avoided with an annual dressing of half an ounce of potassium 
per square yard. Gooseberry plants also have a fairly high requirement for 
magnesium, so if the soil is very acidic and needs lime, use dolomitic 
limestone, which supplies magnesium as well as calcium.</p> 
<p> <b>Pruning:</b> A gooseberry bush is usually grown on a permanent short 
&quot;leg&quot; of about six inches, from which the bush is continually renewed 
with new shoots arising at or near ground level. Allow stems to grow for 
4-5&nbsp;years, then selectively remove oldest stems to make room for new 
shoots. Snap off any branches that form along or below the six-inch leg. Thorns 
make harvest tedious, so pruning is done to open up the bush and make picking 
easier. The plants may be grown as standards or cordons, but this requires a 
lot of care and the fruit often sunburns.</p> 
<p> <b>Propagation:</b> The ease with which gooseberries propagate from 
cuttings depends on the cultivar. Generally, American cultivars are easier to 
root than are European cultivars. Take hardwood cutting in early fall, even 
before all the leaves have dropped. The presence of a few leaves actually 
enhances rooting. Make the cuttings about a foot long, but do not include tip 
growth, dip the base in hormone and pot in ordinary soil. Keep in part shade 
for the first year. Tip layering is a surer method of propagation, though a 
single bush furnishes far fewer layers than cuttings. If intended for training 
as standards or cordons, strip all buds off, cutting below the soil line. Seeds 
require moist stratification, just above freezing, for three to four months. 
The plants commence bearing in 5&nbsp;years from seed and 2&nbsp;years from 
cuttings.</p> 
<p> <b>Pests and Diseases:</b> Aphids commonly attack young leaves, distorting 
them. Spider mites are common in summer; spray immediately after harvest and 
thereafter on a regular schedule. The clear-winged borer lays its eggs on stems 
in April. The larvae hatch and bore into the central pith down to soil line and 
emerge to pupate in the fall. An infestation is usually detected only after the 
stem wilts and dies. Borers will spread and generally causes loss of whole 
planting without quick control. Cut out affected stems, search for others and 
spray. The gooseberry sawfly is present in the Pacific Northwest but has not 
yet been detected in California. Its small green worms will hollow out the 
berries, leaving an empty husk.</p> 
<p> Ribes species are host for White Pine blister rust, which causes few 
problems for gooseberry, but is lethal for 5-needle pines, including California 
natives such as Western Pine (<i>Pinus monticola</i>) and Sugar Pine (<i>P. 
lambertiana</i>). Gooseberries are banned in counties where these pines are 
grown for lumber. Botrytis and Anthracnose can cause rot of leaves and loss of 
young growth, particularly stems lying on the ground or splashed during 
irrigation. Gooseberry mildew is a common problem, affecting both European and 
American types. It is worst in coastal fog, on drought-stressed plants, or 
where irrigation is by overhead sprinkling. Keep plants turgid, never stressed 
for water between irrigations. Benomyl spray before flowering and after harvest 
should control it. Roots are susceptible to both Oak Root fungus (<i>Armillaria 
mellea</i>) and <i>Phytophthora</i>. </p> 
<p> <b>Harvest:</b> Average yield from one gooseberry bush is between eight 
and ten pounds of fruit. Gooseberries used for culinary purposes such as tarts, 
etc. are usually picked underripe. A classic gooseberry concoction is a fool, 
made by folding cream into the stewed fruit. For dessert purposes, however, the 
fruit must be fully ripe.</p>

<h2>CULTIVARS</h2> The European gooseberry is the classic gooseberry of 
cookery and and desserts. The American gooseberry is smaller, adapted to more 
demanding cultural conditions and more productive, but without much character 
and generally inferior for all purposes. As the European can be grown in all 
Californian conditions suited for the gooseberry culture, the American is not 
recommended. Market demand for American gooseberries is static, while 
appreciation for the true European berry is growing. Experimentation with 
European types is limited under California conditions, and many cultivars have 
been introduced in recent years. Only those with proven production are 
described. Growers in unsuitable climates, looking for a substitute for 
gooseberry, should consider the Jostaberry or Buffalo Currant (<i>Ribes aureum
</i>). See CRFG Fruit Facts: Currants.
