<p>Ornamental Shrubs for Sun</p> 
<p>Print Version </p> 
<h3>Description</h3> 
<p>Shrubs are woody perennials that produce multiple stems, shoots and 
branches from the base of the plant. Generally, they survive winter without 
dying back to the ground as herbaceous perennials do, although there are a few 
exceptions. There is no clear distinction between a shrub and a tree; a shrub 
is usually low growing and multi stemmed, but it can also be single stemmed, 
like a tree.</p>
<p>Shrubs have no defined maximum height.</p> 
<p>In this factsheet, the recommended shrubs range in height from 2 ft to 10 
ft, like a sunny site and are deciduous, meaning they shed their leaves in the 
fall.</p> 
<h3>Considerations Related to Choice</h3> 
<p>When selecting a shrub, it is important to check that it is hardy in our 
climate; the hardiness zone, usually located on the plant's tag, indicates the 
minimum winter temperature the shrub can tolerate. Choosing plants suited to 
the growing conditions of your site, is always preferable to changing the 
conditions of the site to suit the plant. Conditions to take into consideration 
are the amount of sun/shade, acidity or alkalinity of the soil, whether the 
soil is primarily clay, loam or sand and proximity of other plants and 
associated root competition.</p> 
<p>Another important, but often missed consideration, is the shrub's size at 
maturity. Checking mature height and width will tell you the amount of space 
the shrub will need for optimum growth.</p> 
<h3>Location</h3> 
<p>Since our focus is on ornamental shrubs for sun, it is important to look at 
how light conditions are classified. Most shrubs adapt well to either sun or 
shade; however, some may produce fewer flowers in a shady location.</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Full sun - plants require at least 6 hours of direct, 
late-morning/afternoon sun</li> 
<li>Partial shade - plants need a minimum of 4 hours of morning or afternoon 
sun, but should be shaded from the hot, midday sun.</li> 
<li>Full shade - plants can thrive with less than 4 hours of sun. A bright 
location that receives no direct sun would be classified as full shade.</li> 
</ul> 
<h3>Uses</h3> 
<p>Shrubs may be used in foundation plantings, hedges, shrub borders, rock 
gardens, as specimen plants, groundcovers and in mixed borders with perennials.
</p> 
<p>In addition to their growth habit (height, width, form), shrubs are chosen 
for characteristics, such as:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Foliage (colour, form, texture)</li> 
<li>Flowers, fragrance</li> 
<li>Attract wildlife, birds and insects for food source, habitat, nesting 
material.</li> 
<li>Fall interest with fruit or berries and colourful foliage.</li> 
<li>Winter interest through bark, structure or form.</li> </ul> 
<h3>Maintenance</h3> 
<p>Once established, shrubs require very low maintenance. They need to be 
watered regularly when first planted and in times of drought. If the soil was 
properly amended, at the time they were planted they will only require a 
feeding in early spring, either with a top-dressing of well-rotted manure or a 
water-soluble fertilizer, to meet their basic needs.</p> 
<p>Individual moisture and nutrient requirements will vary from one shrub to 
another.</p> 
<h3>Pruning</h3> 
<p>Shrubs are pruned for many reasons, including shaping, reducing size, 
removal of broken and diseased branches, thinning, rejuvenation and increasing 
flower and fruit production.</p> 
<p>The most common mistake made when pruning flowering shrubs, is pruning at 
the wrong time. It is always advisable to find out the exact pruning 
requirements because there are variations within the same family of shrubs.</p> 
<p>Flowering shrubs fall into two groups. The first group blooms on new wood 
and produces flowers on this year's growth. These are the late flowering 
shrubs, like hydrangeas, and should be pruned in late fall or early spring, 
before growth begins.</p> 
<p>The second group blooms on old wood produced the previous season. These are 
the early bloomers, like forsythia, and should be pruned immediately after 
flowering. These shrubs will produce new growth during the rest of the growing 
season.</p> 
<p>Deadheading (the removal of spent flowers) is a form of pruning. Shrubs, 
such as lilacs, benefit from deadheading, because this process will help the 
plant put more of its energy into growth, rather than seed formation.</p> 
<p>Pruning should be avoided in late fall, to allow cuts to heal over and 
prevent winter dieback. Spring pruning can be performed as soon as the 
temperatures rise around the freezing mark and are guaranteed not to plunge 
dramatically.</p> 
<h3>Pests and Diseases</h3> 
<p>Shrubs, in general, are easy to grow and have fewer insect and disease 
problems than many other plants. Common pests, such as aphids, leafminers, 
caterpillars, beetles, borers or scale may attack, but the viburnum family, is 
often the most seriously damaged by insects each year.</p> 
<p>The Viburnum Leaf Beetle quickly skeletonizes the foliage of any viburnum 
it attacks; two of the most popular varieties, the Fragrant Snowball Viburnum 
and the Highbush Cranberry are its usual targets. This beetle was introduced 
from Europe in 1996, and it has no natural predators in Canada.</p> 
<p>Fungal diseases, such as verticillium wilt, anthracnose or cankers can 
infect dogwoods, and honeysuckles and lilacs are prone to powdery mildew.</p> 
<h3>Organic Management/Control Strategies</h3> 
<p>The City of Toronto adopted a new municipal by-law (spring 2004) that 
restricts the use of pesticides. For details about the by-law visit the 
Pesticide by-law page on Toronto Public Health's Web site at 
www.city.toronto.on.ca/pesticides or www.toronto.ca/health. Questions may be 
e-mailed to pesticide@toronto.ca.</p> 
<p> Integrated Pest Management (IPM) is an approach to gardening, where 
different methods of control are selected and used in combination, in order to 
treat plant problems effectively and in an environmentally responsible manner. 
This approach can be used in the care of ornamental shrubs.</p> 
<p>IPM uses four general control methods:</p> 
<h4>Sanitation</h4> 
<p>Good sanitation practices are important. Esthetics aside, a tidy garden is 
generally not a desirable environment for pests and disease. Weeds and plant 
debris provide shelter for insect eggs, as well as food for larvae and adult 
insects that may host a variety of pathogens. For these reasons it is important 
to clean up decaying plant material and remove any weeds as they appear and 
before they set seed.</p> 
<p>Diseased plant material (including infected deciduous leaves shed in the 
fall) should be removed and burnt, or disposed of in the garbage, but never 
composted.</p> 
<p>Pruning out diseased branches promptly and proper sterilization of your 
work tools will also help to eliminate or minimize the spread of disease.</p> 
<h4>Cultural Methods</h4> 
<p>The principle behind cultural controls is that a healthy plant is far more 
likely to be able to withstand disease and pest problems than a plant that is 
under stress.</p> 
<p>Begin by selecting plants that are well suited to the existing growing 
conditions of your site; native plants are always a good choice. Look for 
disease-resistant varieties. When planting, prepare the soil well and give your 
plants plenty of space to grow. Over-crowded plants become stressed trying to 
compete with neighbouring plants for light, nutrients and moisture and are more 
susceptible to disease, due to poor air circulation. Make sure that your plants 
are watered deeply when needed. Mulching will help reduce the need for watering 
and weeding. Do not over-fertilize. Soil amendments such as compost, bonemeal 
and manure applied in the growing season help to reduce the need for chemical 
fertilizers. Closely monitor all plants for any signs of disease or pest 
problems.</p> 
<h4>Insect Control </h4> 
<p>Due to the restrictions on pesticide use, this fact sheet only references 
organic controls.</p> 
<p>There are many effective non-chemical methods of controlling insects. Some 
examples are:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Spray infested plants with water, to wash off aphids and spider mites.</li>
<li>Handpick and destroy insects, such as potato and lily beetles </li> 
<li>Use insecticidal soaps to control insects such as aphids, spider mites, 
thrips and scale.</li> 
<li>Traps may be used for slugs, snails and earwigs </li> 
<li>Physical barriers, such as plant collars, act as deterrents to cutworms
</li> </ul> 
<h4>Biological Controls</h4> 
<p>Insects have predators, parasites and pathogens as natural enemies. 
Biological control takes advantage of this fact. Some beneficial insects, that 
are predators to other insects, include ladybugs and lacewings, which feed on 
aphids, scales, mealybugs and mites, and parasitic wasps, which feed on aphids, 
whiteflies and caterpillars. Many of these insects can be purchased at garden 
centers for use as a natural insect control.</p> 
<p>Creating a natural habitat in your garden will encourage wildlife such as 
birds, toads, and snakes that feed on insects. Creating such habitats is 
another form of biological control.</p>
