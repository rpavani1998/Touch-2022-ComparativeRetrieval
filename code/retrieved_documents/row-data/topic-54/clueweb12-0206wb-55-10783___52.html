<p><b>Staff resigns</b></p> 
<p><b>PLPOA may hire management firm</b></p> 
<p><b>By Roy Starling</b></p> 
<p><b>With the vast majority of its staff resigning effective tomorrow, the 
Pagosa Lakes Property Owners Association board of directors will meet today to 
discuss the possibility of contracting with a firm from Denver to manage the 
association.</b></p> 
<p><b>Today's meeting, at 2 p.m. in the Pagosa Lakes Clubhouse, will be a 
continuation of a discussion that began Monday at 8 a.m. That meeting ended 
when acting-president John Nelson suggested the board retire to a closed 
executive session to discuss personnel matters with members of the outgoing 
staff.</b></p> 
<p><b>Nelson chaired the meeting in the absence of PLPOA President Nan Rowe, 
who told the SUN she couldn't make the meeting because she &quot;was in Chicago 
until late Sunday night, and we had house guests Monday morning. The other 
board members knew this, but I was told it had to be taken up at 8 a.m.&quot;
</b></p> 
<p><b>As of tomorrow, the association will have several gaps to fill in the 
administrative staff. Waynette Nell, general manager; Janet Thompson, accounts 
manager; Maureen Clancy, administrative assistant; Erika Cox, accounting clerk; 
and Jean Sanft, administrative aide, will all resign.</b></p> 
<p><b>At Monday's meeting, Nell said she was resigning because of 
&quot;micro-managing by the board. I was unable to do my job, and my health was 
being affected by it.&quot; When pressed to define micro-management, Nell said 
&quot;disrupting the daily activities of the office.&quot;</b></p> 
<p><b>According to Director Jim Carson, Nell should have brought those 
disruptions to the attention of the board. &quot;As a general manager, I think 
you've been flunking your job by not bringing staff problems to the board.&quot;
</b></p> 
<p><b>&quot;I went to Nan on all these issues, but basically nothing 
changed,&quot; Nell replied.</b></p> 
<p><b>Rowe told the SUN that Nell did come to her with problems concerning the 
board. &quot;Three months ago, I called a special board meeting in executive 
session to discuss these issues,&quot; she said. &quot;The silence of the other 
board members in response was deafening. I also said at the time that if the 
board didn't make some changes in the way it related to the staff, the result 
would be mass staff walkouts. The response was more silence.&quot;</b></p> 
<p><b>Although Nell was asked by Director Nelson to name the board member or 
members who were guilty of micro-managing, she refused to do so. She did refer, 
however, to difficulty in accounting caused by &quot;the treasurer moving money 
without the staff being informed.&quot; (Director Judy Esterly serves as the 
association's treasurer. She was out of town Monday and was unable to attend 
the meeting.)</b></p> 
<p><b>Directors Nelson and Ebeling defended Esterly's actions. &quot;The 
treasurer is very dedicated to her responsibility,&quot; Nelson said. Director 
Fred Ebeling said that &quot;the board is entitled to get information from the 
staff, and that's what the treasurer was trying to do. But she was unable to 
get information in a timely manner.&quot;</b> </p> 
<p><b>Thompson, Cox and Sanft declined to speak at this time about the reasons 
for or the timing of their resignations. Clancy would say only that she was 
&quot;looking for something that uses my education and experience a little more 
thoroughly than this job has.&quot;</b></p> 
<p><b>Concerning the proposed contract with Colorado Management and Associates 
Inc., Ebeling said he saw it &quot;as providing interim management. It's only a 
one-year contract. We have to do something quickly.</b></p> 
<p><b>&quot;The only thing the company is providing,&quot; Ebeling said, 
&quot;is a computer-generated accounting service. The general manager who will 
be down here managing the association will be under the direction of the 
board.&quot;</b></p> 
<p><b>Director Dick Hillyer said that &quot;present department managers of 
Recreational Amenities, Lakes and Fisheries, Public Safety and Covenant 
Compliance will continue to run their respective departments.&quot;</b></p> 
<p><b>Director Pat Curtis told the SUN that the board &quot;had no other 
choice&quot; but to seek help from the outside. &quot;The administrative staff 
was unhappy with one of the board members and that board member's relationship 
with the staff. I don't know how much of an effort they made to solve that 
problem, but it never got solved.</b></p> 
<p><b>&quot;Waynette was the first to announce her resignation and it kind of 
had a trickle-down effect. When the rest of them gave their two-week notices, 
there was no time to hire another general manager and office staff. There 
really isn't a choice. This company is very well thought of, has been around 
for a long time, and has managed 50 or so other associations in the state. 
They're real pros.&quot;</b></p> 
<p><b>Not all board members were in favor of hiring the Denver firm. &quot;I 
prefer to do a search and hire a general manager rather than a consulting 
firm,&quot; Director Nelson said. &quot;But I'm only one vote.&quot;</b> </p> 
<p><b>President Rowe also opposes farming out the association's management. 
&quot;We'll be sending $12,000 per month out of our local economy and up to 
Denver,&quot; she said. &quot;We're spending this money for a general manager, 
but that general manager will not be our employee. His employer will be six 
hours away in Denver.&quot;</b></p>

<p><b>Four plead guilty to damaging meadow</b></p> 
<p><b>By Karl Isberg</b></p> 
<p><b>Four of five suspects charged with damaging a meadow on San Juan 
National Forest land in early May entered guilty pleas and were sentenced by a 
Durango-based federal magistrate.</b></p> 
<p><b>According to U.S. Forest Service law enforcement agent Roger Newton of 
the Pagosa Ranger District, five local residents were charged on June 2 with 
unreasonably damaging land, vegetation or resources on the forest.</b></p> 
<p><b>Three of the individuals charged were juveniles. Newton identified two 
local adults charged in the case as Benjamin Murphy, 21, and Jacob Egg, 20.</b>
</p> 
<p><b>Newton said all the suspects but Egg entered guilty pleas, were 
sentenced and were in the process of satisfying the penalties assessed by the 
magistrate .</b></p> 
<p><b>The incident which led to the charges occurred in early May when the 
suspects took off-road vehicles to a meadow on Eightmile Mesa Road, south of 
Pagosa Springs. The section of road next to the meadow was closed to motorized 
vehicles. The suspects drove their vehicles off the road and cut deep ruts 
throughout the fragile meadow environment as well as up the side of an adjacent 
slope.</b></p> 
<p><b>Damage was reported to the U.S. Forest Service by recreational users of 
the road following an article about the incident in the SUN, said Newton. 
Additional information about the case was subsequently provided to his office 
by sources in the community. That information led Newton to the suspects.</b>
</p> 
<p><b>Newton reported that each suspect who entered a guilty plea was assessed 
a small fine by the court and each agreed to do public service work for the 
U.S. Forest Service. Some of that work relates directly to resource management 
and protection.</b></p> 
<p><b>&quot;All of the youngsters have to go at their own expense and under 
our supervision to reseed and rehabilitate the area they damaged,&quot; said 
Newton, &quot;and the work must be complete by Sept. 1. A lot of thought went 
into the penalties for these youngsters. We wanted the kids to appreciate 
resource values with some sweat equity. When you have to go and fix what you've 
done, and see how much time and money it takes to repair this type of damage, 
it's not so much fun anymore.&quot;</b></p> 
<p><b>In addition to the reseeding and rehabilitation work at the meadow, said 
Newton, &quot;one of the youngsters will do public service work by removing 
abandoned properties on forest lands, especially old hunters' camps. His five 
days of work must be complete by Sept. 1.&quot;</b></p> 
<p><b>Newton said another of the young men who entered a guilty plea will 
complete five miles of trail work on the San Juan National Forest while two 
other members of the group will each perform 20 hours of general maintenance 
work at the Pagosa Ranger District office building in downtown Pagosa Springs.
</b></p> 
<p><b>&quot;One of the most important things about this case,&quot; said 
Newton, &quot;is we were able to resolve the situation as a result of a lot of 
public input. We appreciate the help from members of the local community. The 
information they provided allowed us to identify the parties responsible for 
the damage.&quot;</b></p>

<p><b>Canadian lynx killed on Wolf Creek Pass</b></p> 
<p><b>By John M. Motter</b></p> 
<p><b>A Canadian lynx died Friday morning on Wolf Creek Pass after being 
struck by a hit-and-run motorist. Colorado Division of Wildlife biologists were 
notified of the feline's untimely death by a motorist who noticed the animal's 
body lying along the shoulder of the highway.</b></p> 
<p><b>The Wolf Creek lynx death is the second in Colorado caused by a 
motorist. About one month ago, a lynx was struck and killed by an Interstate 70 
motorist on Vail Pass. The Wolf Creek lynx was a female that had been trapped 
in Alaska and released May 10. Her body was discovered about 11 a.m., but she 
was probably hit several hours earlier. The mishap occurred near the top of the 
pass.</b></p> 
<p><b>Both lynx are among those released this past winter in the San Juan 
Mountains as part of a DOW plan to reintroduce lynx into Colorado. Including 
Friday's killing, seven are now dead. Two lynx have been killed on the highway, 
one lynx was shot near Antonito by an unidentified gunman, and four lynx died 
of starvation during the early stages of the release.</b></p> 
<p><b>&quot;Of course the death of these lynx is unfortunate,&quot; said Todd 
Malsmsbury, chief of information for the DOW. &quot;We picked up both carcasses 
and delivered them to Fort Collins for a necropsy. The good news is that both 
had body fat along with food in their stomachs. They have obviously learned to 
find food in Colorado.&quot;</b></p> 
<p><b>The initial releases were made near Wagon Wheel Gap between Creede and 
South Fork during February. When four of those early releases died of 
starvation, the DOW altered the release protocol. First, they held the animals 
longer in pens, ensuring that they were in good condition. Second, they delayed 
releases until spring weather conditions increased the availability of more 
volume and a greater variety of food for the hunting cats.</b></p> 
<p><b>DOW observers have located seven of the eight lynx released during 
March. The seventh was located near Carbondale. So far, lynx from the release 
have been detected as far south as 50 miles inside of New Mexico, as far east 
as the Sangre de Cristo Mountains, as far west as Mancos, and as far north as 
the Vail area.</b></p> 
<p><b>&quot;They have spread out in all directions,&quot; Malmsbury said. 
&quot;The rumor that they were heading north, trying to get back to their 
Alaska or Canada homes, is simply not true.&quot;</b></p> 
<p><b>The Colorado Wildlife Commission authorized the reintroduction of lynx 
and wolverines last year. The lynx project involved two winters, with the 
release of about 50 animals each winter. The release of wolverines has been 
postponed indefinitely by the DOW.</b> </p> 
<p><b>Analysis of the lynx release program is underway. DOW officials have 
said if about 50 percent of the 29 animals released during May die of 
starvation, they will recommend that similar releases planned for the coming 
winter not be made. The final decision concerning releases during the 1999-2000 
winter may be postponed until November in order to gather as much data as 
possible, Malmsbury said.</b></p> 
<p><b>In the meantime, U.S. Fish and Wildlife officials have postponed until 
next year, any decision connected with placing lynx on the threatened and 
endangered species list in the lower 48 states.</b></p> 
<p><b>&quot;They postponed the decision for six months while they gather 
additional data,&quot; Malmsbury said. &quot;Based on our experiences this 
year, we continue to supply them with data.&quot;</b></p> 
<p><b>Colorado has asked the federal wildlife agency to consider Colorado as a 
separate district when classifying the lynx, Malmsbury said.</b></p> 
<p><b>&quot;If they classify us separately, then the decision about Colorado 
will be a separate decision,&quot; Malmsbury said. &quot;If our reintroduction 
program is successful, there will be no need to place the lynx on the 
endangered list in Colorado. If it is unsuccessful, we believe lynx in Colorado 
still should not be on the list. We will have demonstrated that they cannot 
survive here.&quot;</b></p> 
<p><b>All of the released lynx have radio collars. In order to locate the 
lynx, the collars are monitored by aircraft with radio receivers, and by 
personnel traveling on the ground.</b></p>

<p><b>Whopper thunderstorms leave Pagosa soggy</b></p> 
<p><b>By John M. Motter</b></p> 
<p><b>Powerful thunderstorms swelled by towering cumulus clouds, spectacular 
lightning, and booming thunderclaps swept across Archuleta County almost daily 
this past week. The storms produced above average rainfall leaving the 
countryside green and soggy.</b> </p> 
<p><b>An especially severe storm Tuesday evening caused weather observers in 
the National Weather Service office in Grand Junction to issue a severe 
thunderstorm warning at about 5 p.m. Such warnings indicate possible high 
winds, large hail, and intensive localized rainfall. The danger from lightning 
and flash floods is severe.</b> </p> 
<p><b>&quot;That storm was a whopper,&quot; said Jim Pringle, a forecaster 
from the Grand Junction office. &quot;The tops of the cloud approached 40,000 
feet above mean sea level and the coverage of the storm equaled about 
two-thirds of the area of Archuleta County. The storm seemed to contain some 
rotation (potential for tornadoes) and an enormous amount of electrical 
energy.&quot;</b></p> 
<p><b>The same weather conditions that have prevailed in Pagosa Country over 
the past two weeks should continue at least through the coming weekend, 
according to Becky Klenk, a forecaster from the Grand Junction office.</b></p> 
<p><b>&quot;Look for a 30 percent chance of afternoon and evening 
thundershowers through the weekend,&quot; Klenk said. &quot;High temperatures 
should be in the mid-80s to low 90s and lows should be in the 50s.&quot;</b></p>
<p><b>Last week, 1.09 inches of rain were recorded at the official weather 
station located at Stevens Field. During the last two weeks, 2.54 inches of 
rain have fallen in Pagosa Springs, more at selected spots in the high country. 
Rainfall has been recorded on 11 of the last 14 days, including eight straight 
days from July 17 through July 24.</b></p> 
<p><b>Through July 27 the total rainfall this month is 3.21 inches. July's 
long-time average rainfall is 1.63 inches. During July of 1957, 5.78 inches or 
rain fell, the record amount ever recorded during July in Pagosa Springs.</b>
</p> 
<p><b>For the year of 1999, 15.5 inches of rain have been measured through 
July 27. Average Pagosa Country rainfall through July is 9.79 inches.</b></p> 
<p><b>The pattern of recurring thunderstorms should continue through August, 
according to Pringle. This summer pattern is identified as the monsoon season 
by the Grand Junction weather people. During this season, tropical moisture is 
picked up over southern Mexico and transported to the Four Corners area where 
it is released.</b></p> 
<p><b>Clouds in the Pagosa Springs area must reach immense heights in order to 
be detected by the National Weather Service radar beam transmitted from an 
elevation of about 10,000 feet on Grand Mesa east of Grand Junction. Because of 
the curvature of the earth, the beam averages over 27,000 feet above mean sea 
level by the time it reaches Pagosa Springs. Consequently, clouds must be 
higher than 27,000 feet to be detected by the sweeping radar beam.</b></p> 
<p><b>Two primary conditions are involved in the creation of thunderstorms and 
their attendant high energy levels, according to Pringle. The first condition 
is ordinary daytime heating. The second condition is the release of latent heat 
as convection currents carry warm air containing water upward into colder 
temperatures.</b></p> 
<p><b>A climactic layer called the &quot;tropopause&quot; normally establishes 
a ceiling for the clouds, but some cloud peaks pierce the tropopause, Pringle 
said. Above the tropopause, temperatures become warmer instead of colder. 
Because the cooling atmosphere releases energy, vertical convection currents 
are created.</b></p> 
<p><b>The upper portions of thunderclouds contain positive electrical energy, 
while the lower portions, below the freezing level, contain negative electrical 
energy. The ground is normally positively charged, but can be negatively 
charged. When the voltage potential between positive and negative areas is 
sufficient, electrical discharges in the form of lightning occur. These 
electrical potential differences can amount to millions of volts. Lightning 
moves from cloud to cloud or from clouds to the ground.</b></p> 
<p><b>While most lightning discharges are negative, about one out of 100 
lightning discharges are positive, according to Pringle. The positive 
discharges connect positive electrical fields in the cloud peaks with a 
negatively charged ground surface. The result can be devastating.</b></p> 
<p><b>&quot;Lightning causes more deaths in Colorado than any other weather 
phenomena,&quot; Pringle said. &quot;Flash floods rank second.&quot;</b> </p> 
<p><b>Last year, three people were killed and 18 injured by lightning in 
Colorado, Pringle said. Only last week, a tourist was killed in Estes Park by a 
lightning bolt.</b></p> 
<p><b>Lightning passing through the atmosphere can create temperatures of 
50,000 degrees Fahrenheit, five times the temperature of the sun's surface, 
according to Pringle. The intense heating of the atmosphere creates a shock 
wave, identified by the familiar thunderclaps.</b></p> 
<p><b>Most people fail to realize that lightning can strike at a distance of 
10 miles from the clouds denoting the obvious location of a thunderstorm.</b>
</p> 
<p><b>&quot;People need to take cover sooner than they think,&quot; Pringle 
said. &quot;The best test is the 'flash to sound test.' Upon observing a 
lightning flash, a person should count the seconds. Each five seconds equals 
one mile. Persons counting 30 seconds or less, that equals six miles, should 
take cover.&quot;</b></p> 
<p><b>The best cover is inside a house or car. Persons trapped outside should 
find the lowest available ground and avoid trees or other high objects which 
attract lightning. Persons should avoid being the highest object around. 
Persons caught on open ground without cover should curl up in a ball, but 
remain on their feet. Lightning sometimes travels along the surface of the 
ground. By remaining on their feet, people avoid exposing more body surface to 
the ground lightning. The curling up but remaining on the feet principle is 
especially important for people caught in lightning storms above timberline.</b>
</p> 
<p><b>Persons caught in a lightning storm while passing through a forest 
should choose the lesser evil by moving to a section of the forest where the 
trees are lower. Isolated, tall trees should be avoided.</b></p> 
<p><b>National Weather Service storm warnings are not particularly effective 
in Pagosa Country because no weather warning transmitters exist in southwest 
Colorado. Consequently, persons traveling through the high country or traveling 
under other conditions where they are exposed to the weather should study 
weather forecasts and always watch the surrounding skies for changing weather 
conditions.</b></p>

<p><b>Work on Eightmile Mesa Road to start August 15</b></p> 
<p><b>By John M. Motter</b></p> 
<p><b>The rebuilding of Eightmile Mesa Road should start Aug. 15 and be 
completed within 30 days, according to County Manager Dennis Hunt.</b></p> 
<p><b>Loma Linda developer Fred Schmidt and the county, along with two 
adjoining property owners, are involved in the project.</b></p> 
<p><b>Schmidt is responsible for rebuilding the primary road bed stretching 
approximately between U.S. 84 and the entrance to the Loma Linda subdivisions. 
This work will include the elimination of some steep dips and modifying a curve.
</b></p> 
<p><b>The county is responsible for supplying culverts across the main road 
bed and also for driveways. The property owners, Dick Ray and Jack Adams, are 
responsible for installing right of way fences using materials supplied by 
Schmidt.</b></p> 
<p><b>Concerning Schmidt's portion of the work, a $93,250 contract has been 
let with U-Can Afford. Before that work can begin, the county must install four 
approximately 36-inch culverts where Squaw Creek crosses the road. Cost of the 
county's culverts is about $11,800.</b></p> 
<p><b>In the meantime, the county has a lawsuit in place against Schmidt, in 
order to guarantee that the work be finished. Eightmile Mesa Road is located on 
the west side of U.S. 84 approximately 8 miles south of Pagosa Springs. It 
provides access to the Loma Linda subdivisions and Eightmile Mesa.</b></p>

<p><b>Durkee named to planning board</b></p> 
<p><b>By John M. Motter</b></p> 
<p><b>A planning commission member was appointed, dates set for board of 
equalization hearings, and other business conducted by the Archuleta County 
commissioners while meeting in regular session Tuesday.</b></p> 
<p><b>David Durkee was appointed to the Upper San Juan Regional Planning 
Commission board, thereby filling all vacancies on that voluntary body.</b></p> 
<p><b>Durkee was selected from among six applicants for the position. The 
other applicants were Todd Shelton, Nan Rowe, Michael J. Mitchell, Bob Moomaw, 
and Claudia Smith.</b></p> 
<p><b>Durkee joins current board members Linda Delyria, Bobra Schaeper, Julia 
Donoho, Lynn Constan, Bob Lynch, Betty Shahan, Judy James, and Ed Knight from 
the Southern Ute Tribe.</b></p> 
<p><b>A 10-year resident of Pagosa Springs, Durkee's work history includes 25 
years in the ski industry, logging, general contracting, and time as a fishing 
guide. He currently owns and operates Pagosa Lawn and Landscape and Pagosa 
Nursery Company.</b></p> 
<p><b>The county commissioners will sit as a board of equalization concerning 
property valuations for taxing purposes Aug. 3. As the board of equalization, 
the commissioners listen to property owners protesting the value placed on 
their property by the county assessor. During an earlier first step of the 
appeal process, the property owners presented their case to the assessor. That 
step of the appeal process is now closed.</b> </p> 
<p><b>The second step, for those unsatisfied with the assessor's findings, is 
the coming board of appeals session. During the board of appeals session, 
taxpayers state their case directly to the commissioners. Assessor Keren Prior 
attends this session and presents her side of the case. The commissioners are 
empowered to render any decision they feel is justified.</b> </p> 
<p><b>Approximately 25 appeals are anticipated this year, more than last year 
but less than in some previous years, according to County Manager Dennis Hunt. 
Hearings start at the end of the regular Tuesday morning commissioners meeting 
at about 10 a.m. and continue through regular working hours.</b></p> 
<p><b>Prior asked the commissioners to postpone the hearings because she will 
be out of town Aug. 3. She asked for Aug. 9 and 10 or for Saturday, so that she 
can be present.</b> </p> 
<p><b>&quot;The county attorney has instructed us that the language concerning 
the deadline for hearings says 'shall be done by Aug. 5,' &quot; said 
Commissioner Gene Crabtree. &quot;Under those circumstances, we have no choice 
but to hold the hearings by Aug. 5,&quot; Crabtree said. (In the absence of 
Commissioner Ken Fox, Crabtree acted as chairman of the board.)</b></p> 
<p><b>Prior agreed to send a deputy, because she will not be able to attend 
the hearings.</b></p> 
<p><b>The commissioners conducted the following additional business Tuesday.
</b></p> 
<p><b>- Approval of a proposed intergovernmental agreement with Hinsdale 
County regarding management of undesirable plants was postponed based on advice 
from Holthus.</b></p> 
<p><b>- Approval of a proposed intergovernmental agreement with Hinsdale 
County for law enforcement and emergency services was postponed based on advice 
from Holthus.</b></p> 
<p><b>- A contract with Southwest Colorado Mental Health Services was renewed 
providing certain mental health care for prisoners incarcerated in the 
Archuleta County jail. Fees to be paid by the county are $71 for individual 
contact for more than 30 minutes, $35 for individual contact for up to 30 
minutes, $50 for group contact, and $68 for case management.</b></p> 
<p><b>- A resolution was approved endorsing a plan by property owners in the 
Lower Blanco Basin to clean up the shoulders and ditches along Lower Blanco 
Road. The commissioners agreed to supply trash bags for the project from 
Colorado Department of Transportation supplies. County road and bridge trucks 
will pick up the bags after they are filled.</b></p> 
<p><b>- Several variances were approved for a planned unit development located 
on Lot 9 at Cloman Industrial Park. The commissioners followed the 
recommendations of the planning commission concerning the variances.</b></p> 
<p><b>The variances granted are: </b> </p> 
<p><b>1) A requirement that driveways and parking lots be paved was waived 
because roads entering and within the industrial park are not paved. The 
commissioners recommended that the builders pave the driveway and parking lot 
at such time as the access road, Cloman Boulevard, is paved.</b></p> 
<p><b>2) A provision requiring alleys was waived because entrance to the 
proposed building is in the front.</b></p> 
<p><b>3) A requirement for paved sidewalks on both street frontages was waived 
to allow a gravel sidewalk on one side only. The sidewalk on that side enters a 
common green area.</b></p> 
<p><b>4) The requirement for street lights was waived. Instead, the builder 
will install downward-pointing lights on the buildings. One consideration for 
not requiring street lights is the proximity of Stevens Field.</b></p> 
<p><b>5) A request that the requirement for a final plat be waived was denied.
</b></p> 
<p><b>6) A variance from the performance bond requirement was granted on the 
condition that the certificate of occupancy not be allowed until all 
improvements are completed.</b></p> 
<p><b>- The commissioners listened to a suggestion from Tom O'Hare that water 
rights and their availability be included in the county master plan. O'Hare 
presented himself as a concerned citizen.</b></p>

<p><b>Relay for Life surpasses goal</b></p> 
<p><b>By Karl Isberg</b></p> 
<p><b>Relay for Life organizer Leslie Patterson set a fund-raising goal of 
$10,000 for the inaugural event on July 23 and 24 and by Wednesday of this week 
she was thrilled the relay in Pagosa Springs had raised at least $11,836 for 
the American Cancer Society.</b></p> 
<p><b>Nine teams with 134 team participants began their overnight relays at 6 
p.m. on July 23 at Town Park. Teams raised $100 each as entry fees and 
individual team members raised additional funds to contribute to the total. 
Each team developed themes and decorated themselves and their campsites 
accordingly.</b></p> 
<p><b>The Relay for Life began with a &quot;victory lap&quot; by local cancer 
survivors. There were 26 survivors who walked in the event. Rain fell, but did 
not dampen the enthusiasm of the participants.</b></p> 
<p><b>Luminarias devoted to the memory of cancer survivors and those who 
unsuccessfully fought the disease were lit and lined the pathway on which relay 
members walked through the night. Entertainment was provided on Friday night by 
The Cranks.</b></p> 
<p><b>Relay walkers and runners kept up their efforts on the course for 18 
hours, until the finish line was crossed at noon on July 24.</b></p> 
<p><b>&quot;We made the goal,&quot; said Patterson. &quot;This was a huge 
accomplishment for a community this size, doing the event for the first time, 
in the rain. Everyone showed up with umbrellas and with bells on. I was really 
impressed with the commitment, considering the rainy weather.&quot;</b></p> 
<p><b>Patterson said she wanted to thank the 12 volunteers who assisted with 
the event and expressed her thanks to relay participants. &quot;I'm grateful 
for everyone's help,&quot; she said. &quot;Everyone knew I was doing this for 
my dad (Pat Patterson). I told him about it and he cried. He's in San Antonio 
fighting lung cancer. He said he'd be here next year when we do this again. 
We're all a little overwhelmed with the magnitude of the occasion. It's just 
setting in, but everyone's already talking about next year.&quot;</b></p>

Grand Junction.</b></p> 
<p><b>When participants in the Bicycle Tour of Colorado left Pagosa Springs on 
the morning of July 21, they left some disgruntled residents and officials in 
their wake.</b> </p> 
<p><b>Among the upset citizens, you can count frustrated motorists, as well as 
representatives of the town of Pagosa Springs and School District 50 Joint.</b>
</p> 
<p><b>The Bicycle Tour of Colorado was held to benefit Rocky Mountain Public 
Broadcasting which operates public television stations KRMA in Denver and KRMJ 
in Grand Junction. Tour organizer was Kent Powell, of Denver.</b></p> 
<p><b>Organization, or the lack of organization, say dissatisfied local 
officials, was at the root of several problems.</b></p> 
<p><b>According to Town Administrator Jay Harrington, police Chief Don Volger, 
and high school Assistant Principal Kahle Charles, few arrangements with local 
officials were made by tour organizers and when plans were made, many were not 
observed.</b></p> 
<p><b>Traffic and the safety of cyclists and motorists was a primary worry for 
Harrington and Volger.</b> </p> 
<p><b>&quot;Within the town limits,&quot; said Harrington, &quot;there was a 
lack of course marshals to ensure it was a safe riding environment. We've 
received numerous responses from town residents about their concerns with a 
lack of traffic control. Bike riders blocked roadways in construction zones and 
were not stopping at (stop) lights and stop signs.&quot;</b></p> 
<p><b>Harrington said the problems reflect poorly on local cyclists who do not 
appreciate a negative image for their favorite activity and on other cycle 
tours (such as Ride the Rockies, which has been through the area twice) whose 
organizers &quot;come in at least a year ahead, contact everyone and make sure 
plans are in place that will work.&quot;</b></p> 
<p><b>According to Harrington, &quot;an important thing is that, as a 
community with a tourism economy, we rely on special events to boost that 
economy. When an event doesn't go well, it makes a difference for other 
events.&quot;</b></p> 
<p><b>Volger said tour organizers did not respond to a request he made in a 
letter dated March 15 in which he asked for clarification of event plans. He 
said he attended one meeting in Durango held in conjunction with the Colorado 
State Patrol and said a list of concerns he had was largely ignored.</b> </p> 
<p><b>&quot;I got the impression,&quot; said Volger, &quot;they (tour 
organizers) didn't want to talk to anyone. I had some concerns, but they seemed 
to think they had everything taken care of. The only things they were worried 
about were left turns. They said they would have a traffic monitor at the 
intersection of South 8th Street and U.S. 160 to direct bikers to the high 
school. There was no monitor there early.&quot; Harrington noted the absence of 
monitors at U.S. 160 and Hot Springs Boulevard as well as at the intersection 
of Hot Springs Boulevard and Apache Street.</b></p> 
<p><b>Volger said organizers did not contact his department when the tour was 
in town. &quot;I asked them at the Durango meeting to contact us and let us 
know how to get emergency messages to tour participants,&quot; said the chief. 
&quot;No one got in touch.&quot;</b></p> 
<p><b>The condition of the Pagosa Springs High School property following the 
departure of the cyclists provided even more evidence the tour had been in town.
</b></p> 
<p><b>According to Charles, the school district agreed to allow tour 
participants to use select parts of the high school property &quot;because it 
was a charitable event and because the organizer told me there would be only 
400 to 500 people at the high school. We made reasonable requests and agreed 
there would be camping allowed on the soccer field only and that people could 
sleep in the commons area of the building. The organizers paid us a $250 use 
fee, a $250 deposit, plus $50 to use the kitchen for each of three meals. They 
paid one custodian for 12 of the hours they were here and paid another employee 
for 24 hours in conjunction with the meals.&quot;</b></p> 
<p><b>One of the more significant promises made by the tour organizer, said 
Charles, was that &quot;they would have a large clean-up crew. They said they 
would leave the facility clean.&quot;</b></p> 
<p><b>Charles reported the number of tour participants at the site was far 
greater than organizers promised and said it took six district custodians five 
hours to clean the interior of the school. A separate crew cleaned trash from 
the dugouts at the nearby baseball field.</b></p> 
<p><b>&quot;They didn't put away the tables (in the commons area) or clean up 
mud in the building,&quot; said Charles. &quot;We asked them not to go into the 
gym and we asked that no one wearing cleats be allowed in the building. When I 
went down to the building, people were in the gym and people wearing cleats 
were walking through the building. We asked that tents be pitched on the soccer 
field and we found tents on the newly-sodded areas next to the building. People 
had entered the wrestling room when we had asked that it remain closed.&quot;
</b></p> 
<p><b>Charles said tour organizers &quot;did not contact us when they arrived 
in town. I left a message asking them to contact me and they didn't. If they 
had been in touch us, we could have discussed arrangements other than the ones 
we originally made with them, but I couldn't locate a contact person. While we 
understand there would be mud tracked into the building with the conditions at 
the site, we are very disappointed with the lack of clean up. The first logical 
thing for us to ask was if the school would be cleaned. They left us with the 
impression that it would be done.&quot;</b></p> 
<p><b>Asked how the performance of the tour organizers would affect future 
requests for use of the facility, Charles said: &quot;I'm a year smarter now. 
We like to do these things if people are responsible, but not with the way 
these people did it, at the expense of the schools.&quot;</b></p> 
<p><b>Powell responded Wednesday by phone to questions about the experience in 
Pagosa Springs.</b></p> 
<p><b>According to Powell, Volger's assertions that there was a lack of 
communication and that his concerns fell on deaf ears are not true. Powell said 
concern was voiced by the police that an alternate route to the high school be 
established due to construction on South 8th Street and it was satisfied when 
he personally rerouted cyclists to Hot Springs Boulevard.</b> </p> 
<p><b>Harrington's comments about a lack of marshals at major intersections 
were dismissed by Powell. He said the intersection at U.S. 160 and Hot Springs 
Boulevard is &quot;a controlled intersection&quot; with a stop light and said 
he saw no problems with traffic caused by tour participants. &quot;I didn't see 
any overwhelming traffic problems, and I was out there all the time&quot; he 
said. &quot;Putting people at intersections doesn't seem to help.&quot;</b></p> 
<p><b>The complaint by Charles that there was little contact between the 
school district and tour organizers was dismissed as false by Powell. &quot;I 
was in his office with him for 30 minutes,&quot; said Powell. &quot;I 
introduced myself, shook his hand and thanked him for letting us use the 
gymnasium.&quot;</b></p> 
<p><b>Regarding the promised clean up of the school property, Powell said the 
tour &quot;hired a custodian&quot; and it was expected the work would be done 
by the custodian. He said he was unaware that cyclists had entered the 
wrestling room and suggested there would have been no tents on newly-sodded 
lawns if the district had roped off those areas.</b></p> 
<p><b>&quot;We tried to coach people and we let the town know beforehand that 
we were coming in,&quot; said Powell. &quot;A lot of circumstances could have 
been different . . . (town and school officials) probably had complaints, and 
it's easy to throw it back on the tour. Each town we come into prospers by 
$120,000 to $150,000 in revenue. You need to weigh that. We thought Pagosa was 
a pretty good stop; obviously you didn't. I'd like to see us come back to 
Pagosa. As a town, you'll have to weigh that out.&quot;</b></p>

<p><b>Elected public officials should serve public</b></p> 
<p><b>Editor's note: Having personally reported on the regular public meetings 
of the county commissioners, hospital district, school board and town board for 
many years, I know the frustration a reporter experiences when elected 
officials conduct public business in private. The following comments are John 
Motter's analysis on what I consider to be some elected officials' failure to 
comply with Colorado's open meeting laws.</b></p> 
<p><b>By John M. Motter</b></p> 
<p><b>Everyone is familiar with the ringing of church bells. Even though 
church doors have swung open each Sunday for the last 2,000 years, many 
churches still ring the bells each Sunday morning. The sound of the chimes 
serves as a friendly reminder that church services are still being held. The 
privilege of attending or not attending the church of our choice is among the 
most cherished of American freedoms.</b></p> 
<p><b>In a parallel vein, almost everyone is familiar with another of those 
cherished freedoms, the open meetings and open records laws. And, like the 
church bells, it is periodically incumbent upon the citizenry to remind their 
elected servants that public business should be conducted through &quot;open 
doors.&quot; Anything less is reversion to the tyranny and despotism millions 
of Americans have rejected, even sacrificing their lives in the effort.</b> </p>
<p><b>Because they are present at most meetings, the mantle of &quot;sounding 
the alarm&quot; is often draped across the shoulders of representatives of the 
press. It should be clear to all citizens that the press has no special 
privileges relevant to open meetings or freedom of information. When the press 
is denied access to a meeting or to information, every citizen is effectively 
denied that same access. Consequently, any increase of closed meetings or of 
locked information files is a loss for all citizens of a free and open society.
</b></p> 
<p><b>Locally, several violations of open meetings laws have occurred 
recently. It is difficult to ascertain if the violations occurred because of 
ignorance, laziness or because of an unwillingness to conduct public business 
under public scrutiny. The cause doesn't matter. There are no excuses for such 
violations.</b></p> 
<p><b>At a recent meeting of the Pagosa Area Water and Sanitation District 
board of directors, several votes and actions were taken on items not listed on 
the agenda. Members of the board should be reminded that such actions are 
illegal. Persons who oppose those actions, or who simply oppose any illegal 
actions by any board, may find cause to bring suit, have the actions negated 
and in some instances obtain criminal sanctions against the offending board.</b>
</p> 
<p><b>The Archuleta County commissioners recently conducted an executive 
session, with two items listed on the agenda. Item A concerned &quot;contract 
negotiations with Fred Schmidt regarding Eightmile Mesa Road.&quot; Item B 
involved &quot;Review of requests for proposal regarding space needs 
assessment.&quot;</b></p> 
<p><b>I asked county attorney Larry Holthus why either item should be 
conducted in executive session, an environment hidden from the public. Holthus 
replied that &quot;we are negotiating with Schmidt,&quot; and &quot;we want to 
feel free to say things to Schmidt we wouldn't want to say in public.&quot;</b>
</p> 
<p><b>I am convinced both justifications, even if legal, are a real stretch of 
the intent of the open meetings act. The commissioners have been meeting and 
negotiating with Schmidt for years concerning Eightmile Mesa Road. They have 
contracts with him and a law suit pending to ensure he complies with the 
contracts. What is left to negotiate? What remains to be done that must be 
hidden from the public?</b></p> 
<p><b>Concerning the space needs assessment, I sat in a public meeting as each 
of the bidders presented an explanation of his bid, including price. Following 
the meeting, I wrote a news story on the presentations, including estimated 
costs. What negotiations remained that should be hidden from the public? The 
reason public bodies are allowed to hold secret negotiation meetings is to 
prevent bidders from learning each other's prices and running their bids up or 
down. How could that apply in this instance?</b></p> 
<p><b>On a related subject, the commissioners regularly vote on items 
obscurely listed on the agenda as &quot;county manager's report,&quot; 
&quot;unfinished business&quot; or &quot;other business.&quot;</b></p> 
<p><b>True, the county manager lists many items under his portion of the 
agenda. It is also true, if business comes in after the agenda is posted and 
the county manager feels that business needs action, the commissioners often 
vote on that item even though it is not on the agenda.</b></p> 
<p><b>I submit that no citizen, even with a copy of the agenda which is posted 
according to law at least 24 hours prior to the meeting, could reasonably 
anticipate a commissioner action taken under such a non-descriptive heading. If 
such actions do not violate the letter of the law, they certainly violate the 
moral intent of the law.</b></p> 
<p><b>It would serve no purpose to repeat all of the provisions of the open 
meetings law here, even if we had space. Still, repeating a few of the 
provisions of that law seems to be in order.</b></p> 
<p><b>As a legislative policy, the law avers: &quot;It is declared to be a 
matter of statewide concern and the policy of this state that the formation of 
public policy is public business and may not be conducted in secret.&quot;</b>
</p> 
<p><b>In general, all bodies formed by the public or appointed by public 
bodies are subject to open meetings laws. A meeting is any kind of gathering 
convened to discuss public business, in person, by telephone, electronically or 
by other means of communication.</b></p> 
<p><b>Closed, also known as executive, meetings are allowed only during a 
regular or special meeting and must be preceded by a notice and an agenda. The 
topic for executive session must be announced to the public. Executive sessions 
are allowed only to consider security matters, property matters, to receive 
legal advice from an attorney or certain personnel matters. The law does not 
require meeting in executive session simply because the subject matter fits one 
of the four stated categories. Judgment is required and that brings us to a 
conclusion.</b></p> 
<p><b>That judgment should always lean in the direction of holding meetings 
and discussions open to the public. Any public body which creates the 
impression that it is hiding from the public is in big trouble. In the long 
run, public business cannot be conducted without public approval. Local public 
bodies that give the impression they are hiding from the public create public 
suspicion and lose public approval. They should take great care not to create 
such an impression. Listen to the bell.</b></p>

<p><b>Sales tax at record pace</b></p> 
<p><b>By John M. Motter</b></p> 
<p><b>With one-half of 1999 accounted for, sales tax receipts continue to 
fatten county and town coffers at a record pace.</b></p> 
<p><b>Sales tax receipts for one calendar year set a new record last year when 
the total reached $3,719,235. By the end of June last year, receipts of 
$1,570,625 had been recorded. By the end of June this year, $1,787,765 had been 
recorded, a pace that is 13.83 percent ahead of last year's record setting pace.
</b> </p> 
<p><b>Collections for June of this year amounted to $313,150, or 16.96 percent 
ahead of the $267,751 collected during June of 1998.</b></p> 
<p><b>If 1999 is like 1998, the months for collecting the largest amount from 
sales tax levies still remain. Last year, October, with $450,990 in sales tax 
collections, was the leading month. Following October, the next best months in 
order were July with $393,335, January with $372,755, and September with 
$349,915.</b></p> 
<p><b>The sales tax rate in Archuleta County is 7 percent, both inside and 
outside the town of Pagosa Springs. That amounts to seven cents on each dollar 
of taxable sales. Colorado's Department of Revenue retains 3 percent of the 
levy, the remaining 4 percent is divided equally between the town and the 
county.</b></p> 
<p><b>For July of this year, the county received $156,575 and the town the 
same amount. The county's portion is apportioned among the general fund, road 
and bridge fund, and road improvement fund. For July, the general fund received 
$62,630, the road and bridge fund $15,660, and the road improvement fund 
$78,290.</b></p> 
<p><b>So far this year, county sales tax receipts have totaled $893,885. Of 
that amount, $357,555 has gone to the general fund, $89,390 to the road and 
bridge fund, and $446,940 to the road improvement fund.</b></p> 
<p><b>Pagosa Springs allots its entire sales tax income, $893,885 thus far in 
1999, for capital improvement projects.</b></p> 
<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p> <b>Editorials</b> 
<p><b>An association at risk</b></p> 
<p><b>This time last week I had the misconception that the passage of a year 
could make a difference. I was wrong. A year has passed and folks are still 
creating full-page &quot;Chicken Little&quot; advertisements to warn their 
neighbors the sky is falling.</b></p> 
<p><b>Twelve months ago a supposed &quot;brand new day in the PLPOA&quot; 
became a reality. The three &quot;status quo&quot; candidates in fact did 
&quot;go&quot; once the votes were tallied at the annual election. But as 
predicted in a maligned pre-election editorial, other than names, not much 
changed in the tumultuous and expensive operation of the property owners group.
</b></p> 
<p><b>The PLPOA continues to waste money by providing 24-hour emergency 
medical responses that the tax-supported San Juan Hospital District provides at 
a much higher level of competence and experience. The same is true with fire 
protection which the tax-supported Pagosa Fire Protection District provides the 
area. Thanks to the sheriff's department decision to grant them limited 
authority as level-3 deputies, the association's over paid and over-equipped 
safety office is authorized to issue traffic citations within the subdivisions 
included in the association.</b></p> 
<p><b>Now the directors are wanting to spend $144,000 of the property owners 
money over the next 12 months in order to hire a management firm to carry on 
the responsibilities of the general manager, accounts manager, administrative 
assistant, accounting clerk and administrative aide whose resignations become 
effective tomorrow.</b> </p> 
<p><b>Upon learning of the five resignations, I had to ask myself, who thought 
up the titles for all these positions? Does each of them have their own desk, 
computer, calculator, phone, medical and dental coverage, paid vacation and 
other benefits?</b></p> 
<p><b>It must be an eight-hour job for the top administrator to manage all the 
managers, assistants, clerks and aides that fill the lower links on the chain 
of command in the administration office. But with all the assistants, clerks 
and aides it must be a doable task.</b></p> 
<p><b>I also found myself wondering about how many similar positions exist in 
the association's public safety office. Does the top person have a secretary? 
And does the secretary have an aide or a clerk?</b> </p> 
<p><b>Are two managers, an assistant, a clerk and an aide really needed to 
operate a property owners association? Surely there is an effective, affordable 
software program on the market that is capable of handling the management needs 
of a property owners association.</b></p> 
<p><b>This year's annual meeting is an opportune time to seriously consider a 
new course of action that would best protect and enhance property values in the 
subdivisions. Rather than being concerned about the survival of an expensive 
bureaucratic structure, it's time to decide what facets - such as road 
maintenance, recreational amenities, fisheries - are of the most concern to the 
overall membership of the association.</b></p> 
<p><b>Rather than being concerned about the survival of the PLPOA, it's the 
ideal time to implement a cost-effective down sizing of the association's 
expensive administrative chain of command and costly staff structure. Otherwise 
the eventual new bureaucracy will continue to do all it can to justify its 
existence, expand its size and increase its salaries and benefits and spend 
someone else's money.</b></p> 
<p><b>And there will always be another director who is willing to help 
micro-manage the operation.</b></p>

<p> </p> <b>Dear Folks</b> <b>By David C. Mitchell</b> 
<p></p> 
<p><b>Tuning thy neighbor's piano</b></p> 
<p><b>Dear Folks,</b></p> 
<p><b>Nothing enhances my appreciation of Pagosa Springs more than hosting 
out-of-town visitors.</b></p> 
<p><b>Since Tuesday of last week I've tried to juggle my responsibilities as 
editor and as a host.</b></p> 
<p><b>My sister, Kathryn, and her husband, John Lye, are visiting from St. 
Catharines, Canada. I hope they are enjoying themselves as much as I enjoy 
having them visit.</b></p> 
<p><b>Saturday morning we rode our mountain bikes up to Plumtaw Road as far as 
Cottonwood Creek just so we could turn around and enjoy the ride home.</b></p> 
<p><b>Sunday afternoon we hiked the Continental Divide Trail from the Wolf 
Creek Pass crest up to the top of Alberta Peak. Every time my breathing started 
sounding like a steam locamotive, my sister discreetly stopped to identify the 
wild flowers or examine the interesting rocks.</b></p> 
<p><b>Monday afternoon we parked at the Fourmile Road trailhead and hiked to 
Fourmile Falls. As the hike moved further uphill I realized that though my 
breathing resembled the huffing and puffing of an engine, I was trailing behind 
like a caboose.</b></p> 
<p><b>Being able to spend some protracted time enjoying the nearby national 
forests raised some questions about the &quot;San Juan Citizens Alliance.&quot; 
That's the group that is &quot;organizing for the people and land of the San 
Juan Basin.&quot; Earlier this month I received a fax from the SJCA regarding a 
&quot;citizen rally to oppose exclusive resort development in the East Fork 
Valley.&quot; The fax claims that the &quot;Piano Creek Ranch&quot; being 
proposed for development on Dan McCarthy's property will be &quot;constructed 
in one of the last unspoiled valleys in the San Juans.&quot;</b></p> 
<p><b>Monday, an article on Piano Creek in The Denver Post repeated SJCA's 
concern about one of the last unspoiled valleys in the San Juans and reported 
on the proponent's desire &quot;to develop a ranch in the wilds of 
Colorado.&quot; Give me a break.</b></p> 
<p><b>If anything, Dan McCarthy's privately-owned East Fork Ranch is far from 
being a wild, unspoiled valley. It's bounded on one side by a highly-used 
Forest Service road. It's about 3 miles from some public campgrounds and 5 
miles from a heavily-traveled, paved U.S. highway.</b></p> 
<p><b>It's a contradiction of terms to drive to or through an unspoiled valley 
or wild area. Folks who are willing to invest the sweat and accept the soreness 
can hike into such areas, but they are not reached by maintained roads.</b></p> 
<p><b>I talked with the county manager in Mineral County about the east Fork 
Ranch earlier this month. He said that other than an informal meeting between 
the Piano Creek proponents and the county commissioners, nothing in the way of 
preliminary plans have been prepared or submitted.</b></p> 
<p><b>If the Friends of the East Fork Valley want to be the self-appointed 
protector of private lands in this area, they are a little late. They should 
have been here in the early 1970s and saved the former John Stevens Ranch from 
becoming today's Fairfield Pagosa.</b></p> 
<p><b>If in fact there are a sufficient number of folks who are willing to 
spend $500,000 on an eight-week time share, the Mineral County commissioners 
won't hesitate one second on approving a feasible planned unit development for 
the East Fork Ranch, and accepting the subsequent property tax revenues.</b></p>
<p><b>I can hope for the best. I don't own the land. Even if it was for sale, 
I couldn't afford to buy it. And despite owning a word processor, laser printer 
and fax machine, I'm not going to try to save Dan McCarthy's or anyone else's 
private land.</b></p>

<p></p> 
<p><b>Memories of days gone by</b></p> 
<p><b>On Tuesday, July 20, I visited Mrs. Frances Rock Coffee and her 
daughter, Ilah. Mrs. Coffee grew up in and around Pagosa Springs and shared 
some of her memories with me which I will, in turn, pass on again this week.</b>
</p> 
<p><b>Mrs. Coffee told me that she learned how to play the piano when she was 
about 8 years old. She learned from a Mrs. Green in Dulce, N.M. Mrs. Green was 
the only lady in Dulce who knew how to play, and she was deaf. One of her 
favorite memories was playing the organ in the Methodist Church. She was too 
small to reach the pedals on the pump organ, so her teacher would pump the 
organ and Frances would play.</b></p> 
<p><b>She also played for the school and the town orchestras. Later Frances 
played three years for the silent movies at the local theater. When the 
&quot;talkies&quot; came, she collected tickets for the movies.</b></p> 
<p><b>Little Frances attended school in Dulce where her grandfather was 
employed by E.M. Biggs. Biggs operated a lumber mill. By seventh grade, the 
Rocks had returned to Pagosa Springs to live. Frances attended the school on 
the hill at the corner of U.S. 160 and Fifth Street. It was while she was in 
seventh grade that the school burned. Afterwards Frances found herself 
attending a makeshift school at the Baptist Church while a new school was 
constructed.</b></p> 
<p><b>During high school, she worked for Mrs. Pim at the telephone 
switchboard. She would go to work in the afternoons after school and this 
allowed Mrs. Pim to have some relief from operating the switchboard.</b></p> 
<p><b>Frances Rock graduated from Pagosa Springs High School in May of 1931, 
one of a class of 11. In August of that same year, she married Oran Coffee. The 
young couple moved to Amarillo, Texas, where they raised a family of four 
daughters.</b></p> 
<p><b>Oran Coffee was a veteran of World War I. Mrs. Coffee wrote to me in 
1994 about her husband, &quot;He drove a truck in the Area Squadron, 15 planes. 
When he enlisted, he was in the Cavalry, sent to Columbus, N. Mex. He was there 
when Pancho Villa attacked the town. (Gen. John J.) Pershing was his commander. 
But no horses were sent, just trucks (solid rubber tires and carbide lights).
</b></p> 
<p><b>Years later, &quot;Oran worked at Pantex, Amarillo, where part of the 
atomic bomb was assembled. He was a fireman and thus on the safety squad. They 
loaded bombs there also.&quot;</b></p> 
<p><b>In closing, I would like to thank Mrs. Coffee and her daughter for 
taking time to visit with me and share their memories of days gone by. I hope 
they'll be able to return to Pagosa for another visit soon.</b></p>

The hours at the Museum are 9 a.m. till 4 p.m. Mondays through Fridays, and an 
occasional Saturday. Volunteers are needed.</b></p> 
<p><b>The plans for the Pioneer Museum are to repair and stabilize the water 
holding tanks. The next phase will be to construct a roof over the tanks and to 
move the original Fort Lewis officers' cabin now housed at the Hott Ranch on 
Four Mile Road to the museum to be placed in a tank.</b></p> 
<p><b>The waterworks structure was built in 1938 to serve Pagosa Springs. 
Donations are needed for this restoration project. Any donation is welcomed, 
regardless of how small, but there is a donation system that could help in a 
mighty big way. One can make a onetime donation of $500 (or pay $25 a month for 
3 years) and become a member of the Headgate Club; or make a donation of $1,000 
(or $30 a month for 3 years) and become a member of the Pipeline Club; or make 
a $5,000 donation and be a member of the Reservoir Club; or give $10,000 and be

<p><b>Trail work</b></p> 
<p><b>The Pagosa Springs Trails Council, an amalgamation of local area trail 
user groups, worked on the Monument Park Trail this past weekend. The trail 
connects the Turkey Springs area with the First Fork Road, located along the 
Piedra River west of Chimney Rock. The trail was cleared of fallen trees, and 
drainage ditches were installed to help control erosion. This trail is 
important because it's a part of a future hut and trail system, but, as of now, 
it is not open for motorized use.</b></p> 
<p><b>Fun on the run</b></p> 
<p><b>If you don't understand this tale then ask a golfer.</b></p> 
<p><b>A man was about to tee off when he felt a tap on his shoulder and a man 
handed him a card that read, &quot;I am a deaf mute. May I play through, 
please? &quot;</b></p> 
<p><b>The first man angrily gave the card back, and communicated that 
&quot;no, he may not play through, and that his handicap did not give him such 
a right.&quot; The first man whacked the ball onto the green and left to finish 
the hole.</b></p> 
<p><b>Just as he was about to putt the ball into the hole he was hit in the 
head with a golf ball, knocking him out cold. When he came to a few minutes 
later, he looked around and saw the deaf mute sternly looking at him, one hand 
on his hip, the other holding up four fingers.</b></p>

<p><b>Newsworthy</b></p> 
<p><b>This seems to be our year for being in the news. I don't think anyone 
missed our mention on nationwide television with the &quot;Good Morning, 
America&quot; show a few months back and the beat goes on. I have in front of 
me four or five articles that appeared in newspapers in Indiana, Arkansas, 
California and Washington, D.C. Pagosa Springs is mentioned in regard to 
everything ranging from our great ski season last year, to retirement location, 
to Y2K readiness, to a fitness forum in Arkansas at which Ming Steen spoke.</b>
</p> 
<p><b>We can now add to that list an extremely complimentary article that 
appeared in the June/July edition of &quot;SW Aviator&quot; written by Greg 
Gibson. Gibson acknowledges that, &quot;Though marquee resort towns like Aspen, 
Vail and Telluride are more likely to be covered in mainstream travel 
publications, Pagosa Springs is as worthy a destination as any other in the 
state.&quot; His article is a Chamber of Commerce dream come true because he 
addresses just about all of the area attractions that we would normally spend 
thousands of dollars extolling in all the various mediums. He addresses the 
glories of Wolf Creek Ski Area for both skiers and boarders, our 27-hole golf 
course, the San Juan National Forest, abundant fishing, hiking, biking, 
camping, bird-watching, hunting opportunities, local museums and of course, the 
hot springs. I share this with you just so you will know that our secret is 
out. There are those of you who jokingly (and sometimes, not so jokingly) 
accuse me of doing my job too well in getting the word out about Pagosa Springs 
so, in my defense, I had nothing to do with the aforementioned publicity 
although I must admit that I celebrate the advertising dollars saved when 
someone else writes about us. As I understand it, it is my job to encourage 
folks to come to Pagosa as a vacation destination. I just can't be held 
responsible when they subsequently fall in love and decide to move here. We 
have the excellent good fortune to have found this divine place and it only 
makes sense that others will follow suit.</b></p>

<p><b>&quot;Pop N. Fresh Dies. Veteran Pillsbury spokes-model Pop N. Fresh 
died yesterday of a severe yeast infection. He was 71. Fresh was buried in one 
of the largest funeral ceremonies in recent years. Dozens of celebrities turned 
out including Mrs. Butterworth, the California Raisins, Hungry Jack, Betty 
Crocker, Chef Boyardee and the Hostess Twinkies.</b></p> 
<p><b>The grave site was piled high with flours as longtime friend Aunt Jemima 
delivered the eulogy, describing Fresh as a man who never knew how much he was 
kneaded.</b></p> 
<p><b>Fresh rose quickly in show business, but his later life was filled with 
many turnovers. He was not considered a very smart cookie, wasting much of his 
dough on half-baked schemes. Still, even as a crusty old man, he was a roll 
model for millions. Fresh is survived by his second wife. They have two 
children and another in the oven. The funeral was held at 3:50 for 
approximately 20 minutes.&quot;</b></p>

<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p> <b>Features</b> <b>Video Review</b> <b>By Roy Starling</b>
<p></p> 
<p><b>West pretty wild in 'Stagecoach'</b> </p> 
<p><b>Well, the new &quot;Wild, Wild West&quot; is finally here, playing at a 
theater near you, and I'm sure it's very good, stretching the fine art of film 
making to new heights. Sadly, my lack of interest prevents me from checking it 
out.</b></p> 
<p><b>Instead, I'd like to reflect on a poor little Western that was 
handicapped by a lack of computer-generated special effects. I'm talking about 
&quot;Stagecoach,&quot; made back in 1939, the same year as &quot;Gone With the 
Wind&quot; and &quot;Wizard of Oz.&quot; It was directed by John Ford, 
considered by film scholars as one of the old American masters of cinematic art.
</b></p> 
<p><b>With little technical wizardry at his disposal, Pappy (as Ford was 
called by his cast and crew) had to settle for making a movie based on a well 
written story and focusing on interesting, well developed characters. What a 
concept!</b></p> 
<p><b>In &quot;Stagecoach,&quot; Ford deftly contrasts the expansive nature of 
the Western landscape (the film was shot on location at nearby Monument Valley) 
with the claustrophobia of close quarters. In his exterior shots, you can see 
forever, around and beyond the massive 1,000-foot buttes on the Valley's floor.
</b></p> 
<p><b>Once inside (in the stagecoach or in little outpost cabins), however, 
you have the film's major characters squeezed together, rubbing shoulders, 
knocking knees and smelling each other's breath. Seems like no matter how much 
room there is, folks have got to learn to live together.</b></p> 
<p><b>Through his choice of characters, Ford assembles a kind of microcosm of 
Western society as it was depicted on the silver screen. There are outcasts and 
aristocrats, good guys and bad guys, rich and poor, outlaws and businessmen, 
brave and cowardly.</b></p> 
<p><b>But because Ford was an artist and not just some hack trying to make big 
bucks through commercial tie-ins with fast-food companies, his characters 
aren't so easy to categorize. They go beyond their types and thus surprise us, 
making us doubt our ability to peg people at first peek.</b></p> 
<p><b>The outcasts, for example, are Dr. Josiah Boone (Thomas Mitchell), an 
alcoholic physician; Dallas (Claire Trevor), a lady of the late afternoon and 
evening; and the Ringo Kid (John Wayne), an escaped convict. Doc and Dallas are 
on the stagecoach because they've been driven out of town by the nice ladies of 
Tonto's Law and Order League. Ringo is picked up early in the trip (he's had to 
euthanize his horse) and promptly arrested by Sheriff Curly Wilcox (George 
Bancroft).</b></p> 
<p><b>Doc, for all of his drunkenness, is the wisest of the lot, and serves as 
a kind of father to the orphaned Dallas and Ringo. Mitchell, incidentally, won 
an Academy Award for his portrayal of Doc. Dallas turns out to be the typical 
tart with a heart, unselfishly caring for one of the other passengers who I'll 
mention later. Ringo is a good-natured, good-hearted, lovable, courageous kid 
whose only crime was avenging the death of his father and brother at the hands 
of the good-for-nothing Plummers.</b></p> 
<p><b>The film's alleged respectable figures are a bank president, Henry 
Gatewood (Berton Churchill), whose wife is head of the Ladies' Law and Order 
League, and Lucy Mallory (Louise Platt), a Southern gentlewoman - in a delicate 
condition - in search of her husband in the cavalry. But Gatewood is a pompous, 
selfish windbag who has just robbed his own bank, and Miss Mallory is a 
cold-hearted snob - even though, to her credit, it took a lot of gumption for 
her to be out in the frontier in her condition.</b></p> 
<p><b>Other passengers taking the long, dangerous, symbolic journey from Tonto 
(which means &quot;foolish,&quot; as you probably know) to Lordsburg (the 
Lord's town?) are the above-mentioned Curly; the gentle but cowardly Peacock 
(Donald Meek), a whiskey salesman often mistaken for a preacher; Hatfield (John 
Carradine), a decadent Southern aristocrat prodigal son who boards the coach 
&quot;for the lady's protection;&quot; and Buck (Andy Devine), the coach's dim, 
squeaky-voiced driver.</b></p> 
<p><b>What I've described so far conveys the film's real dramatic conflict, 
even though it doesn't sound much like a Western. How do these people from 
their various backgrounds and with their differing agendas survive the long 
journey through hostile territory in the wild, wild West? Will difficult 
circumstances prompt them to tear each other apart or to grow more tolerant, 
become more of a community, willing to work for each other's survival?</b></p> 
<p><b>They don't get off to a very good start. An early scene succinctly 
captures the tension within the group, especially that rising out of the too 
close proximity of a lady and a prostitute. When the coach stops at an outpost 
for some vittles, there ensues a mealtime scene that is downright painful to 
watch.</b></p> 
<p><b>Dallas sits a little too near Miss Mallory who is then quickly ushered 
away by the gallant Hatfield, making the lovely young pariah feel like 
something the cat drug in. Fortunately, the affable and naive Ringo is there to 
treat Dallas like an actual human being.</b> </p> 
<p><b>By the time the coach makes it to Lordsburg - ironically, a dark, 
sleazy, Western version of Sodom and Gomorrah - one member has perished, 
another has been seriously wounded, and a certain unrepentant white-collar 
criminal has been arrested. The rest have been molded into unselfish, brave, 
decent human beings. They've been joined by a fresh new soul, and the birth of 
Miss Mallory's baby may represent to English majors the rebirth of the other 
pilgrims.</b> </p> 
<p><b>Almost secondary to the growth of these intriguing characters are the 
typical Western plot devices: the terrorizing of the group by Geronimo and his 
posse, escaped from the reservation; and a final showdown between Ringo and the 
dirty rotten Plummer boys. So what normally drives a Western becomes only 
window dressing in Ford's masterpiece.</b></p> 
<p><b>&quot;Stagecoach&quot; is a pivotal work in the history of American 
cinema. It is credited with raising the Western from silly &quot;B&quot; movies 
intended mainly for country boys to a respected art form and for making a 
legitimate star out of Wayne, who was 31 at the time.</b> </p> 
<p><b>Ford's classic will be watched, enjoyed, praised, imitated and written 
about long after &quot;Wild, Wild West&quot; has settled comfortably into the

<p><b>Little known facts of Pagosa history</b> </p> 
<p><b>Some facts from Pagosa Country history should be filed under the heading 
of &quot;Who Cares?&quot; or &quot;I'll bet you didn't know that.&quot; We have 
included a few of those facts in this week's column.</b></p> 
<p><b>For starters, I'll bet few people know that John J. Pershing purchased 
three Pagosa Springs lots during 1888. Pershing is better known as General 
&quot;Black Jack&quot; Pershing, the leader of American Expeditionary Forces 
during World War I. For younger readers, Pershing was the WW I equivalent to 
Gen. Dwight Eisenhower of WW II fame.</b></p> 
<p><b>- According to records in the Archuleta County courthouse, on June 1, 
1888, the U.S. Land Office in Durango received from John J. Pershing of Fort 
Stanton, N.M ., $15 in full for lots 13, 14, and 15 of block 28, each 
containing 50 by 150 feet. Fort Stanton was the young lieutenant's first duty 
station after graduating from West Point.</b></p> 
<p><b>On that same date, Mrs. Ida Hodgsen, also from Fort Stanton, purchased 
lots 16 and 17 of block 48 for $10. On June 20 of the same year, George L. 
Scott purchased lot 11 of block 57 for $4 and Thomas Cruise purchased lots 13 
through 17 of block 59 for $4 each. Both men were from Fort Stanton.</b></p> 
<p><b>The Pagosa Springs lots purchased by Pershing were apparently not sold 
during the 1885 government auction of Pagosa Springs town lots. The town site 
was surveyed in 1883 and the lots auctioned by the U.S. Land Office in 1885. A 
peculiarity of the plat and sale was that only measured lots were sold. Streets 
and lands between measured lots continued to belong to the federal government 
until years later.</b></p> 
<p><b>The former Pershing lots are located on the southeast corner of the 
intersection of Pagosa and 3rd streets.</b></p> 
<p><b>- The adobe building housing the Bear Creek Saloon on Lewis Street first 
opened to the public Sept. 1, 1900. It was built by Frank Buckles, of whom we 
know quite a bit, and a Mr. Schutz, of whom we know little. The first building 
was two-story, but considerably smaller than the current building and operated 
as a general store. A short while later, Mrs. Schutz began taking in boarders. 
Within a few years, in 1904 to be precise, Bryce Patterson of Georgia Colony 
and Silverton fame purchased and enlarged the building, and added geothermal 
bath facilities. Patterson changed the name to the Arlington Hotel. Buckles 
moved to Arizona, where he passed away. Of Schutz, we know nothing. Patterson's 
name was associated with the building for many years.</b></p> 
<p><b>- Frank Frakes built the Pagosa and Northern Railroad's station house in 
Pagosa Springs, starting in October of 1900. Asa Poor was the first station 
manager. The first engine from that line, which connected Pagosa Springs with 
Pagosa Junction, rolled into town on a Saturday night, Oct. 9, 1900.</b></p> 
<p><b>- During 1920, the unincorporated town of Edith, located in Archuleta 
County on the Navajo River about 25 miles south of Pagosa Springs, boasted of a 
hotel, company store, public hall (for the Knights of Pythias), post office, 
light plant, and a big lumber mill owned at the time by McPhee and McGinnity of 
Denver and E.M. Biggs. A company railroad ran from Lumberton, N.M., six miles 
to the south, and to logging camps north of Edith. A few years earlier, the 
railroad had reached within three miles of Pagosa Springs. By 1920, the easy 
timber in that corner of the county had been logged and small, scattered stands 
kept the mill's saws buzzing.</b></p> 
<p><b>The lumber milling plant had a capacity of 80,000 feet per day and 
included a planing mill and box factory. E.M. Biggs managed the plant and 
Pagosa pioneer Welch Nossaman was assistant superintendent of the logging camps.
</b></p> 
<p><b>- During 1913, an estimated 105,000 head of sheep grazed on U.S. Forest 
Service land in Archuleta County. They represented an investment of 
approximately $500,000. These sheep produced an average of four pounds of wool 
per year per head for a total of 420,000 pounds. Because wool sold for 12 cents 
a pound, Archuleta County income from the sale of wool amounted to about 
$50,000. About 75,000 head of lambs and a few old ewes were sold at the end of 
summer for an average of $3.25 a head or a total of $250,000. The total revenue 
from sheep for the year was about $300,000.</b></p> 
<p><b>The average flock of sheep ranged from 1,500 to 2,000. They begin to 
move up from the south in March or April and reached the lambing grounds during 
the latter part of April. The lambing season usually began about the 10th of 
May and lasted to the first of June. Following lambing season, the flocks were 
driven to the highest mountains until October. By October, the May lambs 
reached a weight of 75 pounds and were sold to eastern feed lots. The best 
lambs in 1913 brought an average price of $4.</b></p> 
<p><b>Navajo ewes were often added to upgrade the herd, along with Rambouletta 
rams. During winter months, the sheep were driven by easy stages 50 to 100 
miles south of the Colorado/New Mexico line where they were wintered.</b></p> 
<p><b>Often a 100 percent crop in lambs were marketed, and when such is the 
case it represented a 75 percent profit less the cost of the year's running 
expenses, which ought not to exceed 50 percent of the gross income.</b></p> 
<p><b>- One of my favorite old time Pagosa characters was Fil Byrne. His given 
name was Felix and he arrived in Pagosa Country during 1878, having reached the 
swashbuckling age of 19 years. By the time Byrne died in 1932, he had lived in 
Pagosa Country about 54 years. His life spanned the transition of Pagosa 
Springs from a frontier fort community with almost as many bars as people to a 
modern mountain resort. Byrne is said to have been the community's first school 
teacher, holding forth in a little log cabin on the east side of the river and 
opposite the fort.</b></p> 
<p><b>When Archuleta County was created in 1885, one of the first official 
duties was to form a school system. In those days, each county had a 
superintendent of schools who presided over the many school districts. Byrne 
was the county's first superintendent of schools. He also carried mail from 
Summitville to Pagosa Springs, drove the stage from Amargo to Pagosa Springs, 
and was county judge for many years.</b></p> 
<p><b>Through it all, he often found time to serve as a deputy sheriff. The 
following story recorded in an early newspaper before the turn of the century 
provides ample evidence of why a sheriff would want Byrne for a deputy.</b></p> 
<p><b>It seems that J.P. Archuleta, one of the Archuleta family for whom the 
county is named, swore out a warrant before Justice Chase charging L.D. O'Neal 
with the theft of 16 head of cattle. In those days, the Colorado judicial 
system included the justice of the peace function. The warrant was served by 
Deputy Byrne, who, when he wasn't chasing criminals, also served as county 
superintendent of instruction. Byrne was accompanied by Lee Parr and Frank 
Brown as he served the warrant on O'Neal just below the crossing of the 
Summitville Road and Four Mile Creek a few miles east of town. O'Neal had sold 
the cattle to a gentleman from Monte Vista, and they were on their way then 
driving them over the range.</b></p> 
<p><b>As the party passed the ranch of Gordon Grimes on their way back to 
town, Byrne got off his horse to tighten the cinch strap. Because a cloud of 
flies seemed particularly bothersome to Byrne's horse, O'Neal made a play to 
brush them off. Instead, he used a quirt on the steed, causing it to jump to 
the side on which Byrne was standing.</b></p> 
<p><b>At that same instant, O'Neal touched spurs to the flanks of his own 
mount and was soon galloping up the road at a forty-mile gait, ignoring Byrne's 
call to halt. Byrne then drew his Winchester from its scabbard and fired at the 
running horse at a distance of 100 yards. The first shot broke one of the 
animal's legs.</b></p> 
<p><b>The horse fell and O'Neal continued another 20 feet before uniting with 
the ground in a heap somewhat separate from the horse. The parties soon landed 
their prisoners in jail following the excitement. We do not know what fate the 
justice system granted O'Neal, but we know his bond was set at $1,500.</b></p> 
<p><b>After telling the Byrne story, the newspaper editor completed his column 
with the following, unrelated item.</b></p> 
<p><b>- A miserable imposter is said to be working his game in some of our 
neighboring towns, selling from house to house a salve which he guarantees to 
cure warts. All sensible people know that the only way to remove a wart is to 
rub it with a half raw potato, which must afterward be buried by a pigeon-toed 
school boy in the northwest corner of a graveyard at midnight during the dark 
of a storm. As the potato decays, the wart disappears. Don't pin your faith on 
wart salve, when so cheap a remedy is available.</b></p> 
<p></p> <b>Motter's Mutterings</b> <b>By John M. Motter</b> 
<p></p> 
<p><b>Will these foolish questions never end?</b></p> 
<p><b>&quot;Is that you John?&quot;</b></p> 
<p><b>The person asking the question is looking straight into your unblinking 
brown eyes.</b></p> 
<p><b>&quot;No. It's not me, mom. I'm somebody else. What's the deal? Do I 
look different?&quot;</b></p> 
<p><b>&quot;Oh, don't be a smart aleck,&quot; mom said with disgust.</b></p> 
<p><b>The above dialogue takes place every day in the living rooms of America. 
Such silly conversation could be filed away under the heading of &quot;Foolish 
Questions,&quot; the title of a country western song I once heard.</b></p> 
<p><b>Examples of foolish questions are endless.</b></p> 
<p><b>I am in the bathroom in front of the medicine cabinet mirror, face 
covered with lather from sideburn to sideburn, my mouth contorted, and razor in 
hand. The wife calls from the kitchen. I can't hear clearly, so I walk into the 
kitchen.</b></p> 
<p><b>&quot;What were you saying?&quot; I ask.</b></p> 
<p><b>&quot;Oh. Were you shaving?&quot; the wife says.</b></p> 
<p><b>&quot;No,&quot; I reply. &quot;I just like the taste of soap. I thought 
I'd lather up and lick it off like a popsicle. You know how I love the taste of 
lemon-lime shaving cream.&quot;</b></p> 
<p><b>A few years ago, I attended the funeral of a former friend. On the way 
home after the funeral, I met another friend who inquired about my formal 
attire.</b></p> 
<p><b>&quot;I'm on my way home from Mack McTruck's funeral,&quot; I explained.
</b></p> 
<p><b>&quot;No kidding? Did Mack die?&quot; the friend wanted to know.</b></p> 
<p><b>&quot;Not really,&quot; I said. &quot;Mack just wanted to be sure, when 
he died, that everything would go as planned, so we went through a dress 
rehearsal, you know, nailed him in a coffin, lowered the coffin in the grave, 
and threw dirt on it. Real life like. Just like they do for weddings, you 
understand.&quot;</b></p> 
<p><b>The list goes on and on and includes questions asked on employment forms 
and credit applications. I've always been tempted to provide the following 
answers to questions about my appearance: (1) hair? answer - some; (2) eyes? 
answer - two and (3) sex? answer - of course.</b></p> 
<p><b>When asked why I want a job I answer, &quot;Because I need income.&quot; 
Why lie and say I want the job because I just can't wait to go to work or some 
other equally stupid answer?</b></p> 
<p><b>The most annoying questions come during those 2 a.m. telephone calls, 
especially the ones from your adult children. The scene unfolds something like 
this. The telephone rings. After the second or third ring you decide you are 
not suffering from a nightmare; the telephone really is ringing. After fumbling 
around, getting the receiver in your hand, placing the proper end against your 
ear, dropping it and going through the process of orienting the receiver one 
more time, you say &quot;Hello.&quot;</b></p> 
<p><b>&quot;Hello. Is that you dad? Say, I've just found the greatest 
restaurant.&quot;</b></p> 
<p><b>&quot;Mumble, mumble,&quot; from dad.</b></p> 
<p><b>&quot;I didn't wake you, did I dad?&quot;</b></p> 
<p><b>&quot;Not completely,&quot; I answer. &quot;I was just sitting here with 
the phone in my lap and wondering what to do next when, miracle of miracles, it 
rang. There you are at a great restaurant. I'm so tickled for you I can hardly 
stand it.&quot;</b></p> 
<p><b>&quot;Good,&quot; answers a much-relieved number one son. &quot;I was 
afraid you might be asleep. I know when people get past a certain age, they 
need more sleep.&quot;</b></p> 
<p><b>&quot;And dad. About this restaurant. The food is great, but the prices 
are a little steep. In fact, I can't cover the price of my meal and they have 
this policeman standing over my table. Can you help?&quot;</b></p> 
<p><b>Talk about foolish questions. And foolish dads. Anyway, I show up at El 
Singe, the great restaurant, wearing a robe, bathroom slippers, and a deep 
frown. Only my son, the owner, and the policeman remained in the room. The 
owner's frown matched my own.</b></p> 
<p><b>I walked up to the table, credit card in hand.</b></p> 
<p><b>&quot;Is that you dad?&quot; my son asked.</b></p> 
<p><b>&quot;No,&quot; I replied. &quot;I'm the credit card fairy.&quot;</b></p>
<p><b>I ask you, Is there no end to these foolish questions?</b></p>

<p><b>Plea for animals</b> </p> 
<p><b>Dear Editor,</b></p> 
<p><b>I will never ever understand how so many humans can be so cruel and 
unfeeling towards children and animals. I realize some of what goes on is from 
ignorance and even just downright stupidity, so I'm hoping to get through to 
some of these people. First of all, it is so extremely important to spay and 
neuter your dogs and cats, especially the females, so that there are not so 
many more unwanted animals added to our already over-burdened pet population. 
Many just get dumped by the side of the road. I know, as I am fostering two 
young mixed-breed female dogs who were dumped in Aspen Springs along with their 
brother. They were obviously not treated well, as they were terrified of 
people. But amazingly enough, they still love people and with work, they are 
coming out of it. But it makes me sick to think of what they have been through.
</b></p> 
<p><b>I also have an extremely abused Ausie mix that, I believe, has been 
kicked so much and so hard that this has caused physical and mental problems. 
Some very sick person has obviously taken his frustrations out on this helpless 
animal and he will suffer for the rest of his life from the abuse he has 
received. Why can't we all realize that animals feel pain and have feelings too?
</b></p> 
<p><b>Also, there are so many animals at the Humane Society right now who need 
socializing and though there have been notices in the SUN recently about dog 
walkings on Saturday mornings from 10 to noon, not one local person has shown 
up. (I'm not counting July 4th and Pet Pride Day, of course.) Please, folks 
take an hour or so out of your weekend and come out this Saturday to give some 
exercise and loving to these very needy animals.</b></p> 
<p><b>And again, please spay and neuter your dogs and cats. The shelter has a 
fund to help with this if you cannot afford it. If those of you who have 
allowed your dogs and cats to have litters just so your dog can be a mother 
just one time or your children can see the baby kittens, think about what 
happens to them down the line. Some of the people you have given them to may 
not want them when they start getting bigger, or if they become a problem, may 
dump them. Or they may not spay or neuter their animal either and then many 
more will be added who will not necessarily find good homes, if they survive. 
If you went to the shelter and saw how many are already there, you might 
realize what a serious problem this is. For every one that goes out, two more 
come in. When the shelter gets way overcrowded, which is often, someone takes 
them to the Dumb Friends League in Denver, but that only gives them a second 
chance. Not all will find homes. So, please, get smart and find some compassion 
in your hearts and stop adding to our already overpopulated pet world.</b></p> 
<p><b>Thank you,</b></p> 
<p><b>Jean Frisbie</b></p> 
<p><b>No justice</b></p> 
<p><b>Dear Editor,</b></p>

<p><b>Being a resident of Archuleta County was the absolute best that God 
could ever do for me.</b></p> 
<p><b>The people I knew, the friends I made. It was always fun for me, and 
moving away from it was also the hardest thing to do, to live where I loved was 
just a gift. Now being located in Asheville, N.C., has been hard at first but 
also great at the same time.</b></p> 
<p><b>Well, the main purpose of this letter is to remember you all. To 
remember the fun we had, the laughs, the crys. I would first of all say that I 
have had a great summer, but have missed you all atrociously. I have gotten out 
of touch with you all, and the truth is that I was careless, to ever think that 
I should move on, get new friends. That is absolutely untrue. I will always 
think of my tender years from 3-12 were so special to me. I would like to say a 
special hello to Andrea Archuleta, Sunni Goodrich, Mike Valdez, Mark Ginn (the 
funniest guy alive), Mia VanHorn, the Richey's, the staff at the Rolling Pin 
(you guys were great to us), Sarah Blackman, Ashley Snow, Stephany Montoya and 
Ashley Lord. You guys were funny, you guys kept me smiling and busy. I know 
that I have left out so many others that I would just love to say 
&quot;thanks&quot; but being so far apart, I can't.</b></p> 
<p><b>Hope you all are doing well. I will always miss you and just to let you 
know we will be visiting next spring to see you all. Okay, well now I am at the 
end, goodbye Pagosa Springs.</b></p>
