<h3>Suitable Trees: Maples</h3> 
<p> </p> 
<p>Of the deciduous species which make good bonsai Maples (Acer Sp) (it means 
shining) are the stars. They are hardy, easy to train an care for and stunning 
to look at even when not in leaf.</p> 
<p>There are two maple species commercially used, Acer Buergeranium (Trident 
maple) and Acer Palmatum (Japanese Maple ). The Japanese maple has several 
cultivars some of which have beautiful,(there's no other word which fits the 
bill) spring foliage.</p> 
<p></p>

<p>Maples respond well to leaf trimming and this helps to create a fine branch 
structure.</p> 
<p><strong>Propagation</strong></p> 
<p>All Maples are easy to root from cuttings, or indeed layerings. The roots 
of red leafed Maples are however weak and the tree will die if the roots have 
the slightest problem, that's why most red leafed Maples are grafted onto 
'normal' rootstocks.</p> 
<p>Hormone rooting powders/gels will speed up the process, but are not 
essential and a softwood cutting, in a good gritty compost, will root in two to 
three weeks if taken in early summer.</p> 
<p>Layerings depend upon the thickness of the wood, but generally can be 
sperated (depending on the root volume) in a couple of months, remembering to 
remove enough of the top of the tree to bring it into balance.</p> 
<p>The roots of younger trees are more susceptible to frost in their first 
couple of years and will need winter protection, a garage or greenhouse will do 
although I dig my pots into the ground over winter and that seems to work.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p><strong>Placement</strong> </p> 
<p>The Spring foliage of maples is likely to suffer if the tree is placed in a 
windy location. The tips of the opening leaves are prone to dry out.</p> 
<p>Summer also has it's problems. Maples should not be placed in full sun all 
day, morning sun is best but the hot afternoon sun will put the tree and your 
ability to water it adequately, to the test.</p>

<p> </p> 
<p><strong>Watch out for</strong></p> 
<p>The Red leafed cultivars of the Japanese maple (Acer Palmatum), are usually 
grafted onto normal (green leafed) rootstock, as they don't do well on their 
own roots. If you are buying a tree from a garden centre&nbsp; to convert into 
a bonsai, take a good look at the condition of the graft when purchasing the 
tree.</p> 
<p>In The UK we have two 'native' maples, the Field Maple <em>Acer Campestre
</em> and the Sycamore <em>Acer Psudoplatanus</em>, the Field Maple makes a 
very good bonsai, having small leaves and good colour, the Sycamore does not!.

<p><i>Even young Maples will flower and while they can look attractive, any 
attempt to flower and fruit will stress the tree, you're better off removing 
them.</i></p>
