<p><b>County may amend use tax proposal</b></p> 
<p><b>By Tom Carosello and</b></p> 
<p><b>Tess Noel Baker</b></p> 
<p><b>Staff Writers </b></p> 
<p>Is three a crowd?</p> 
<p>That question will get a closer examination in the coming week by the 
Archuleta County board of commissioners following indications that its July 29 
decision to approve grouping three &quot;use tax&quot; issues in one ballot 
question in this year's general election may need to be reconsidered.</p> 
<p>Last week's action by the board proposes extending the county's 2-percent 
sales tax to all building materials purchased outside the county (for use in 
the county) and all machinery and equipment used for oil and gas production in 
the county.</p> 
<p>Also included in the proposal is the notion that all motor vehicles 
purchased outside the county for registration within the county would be 
subject to the tax.</p> 
<p>Although all three considerations were recommended by a task force that 
included ex-officio members representing the county and the town of Pagosa 
Springs, there is apparently concern the inclusion of each on the same proposal 
may hinder the ballot question's potential to gain voter approval. </p> 
<p>&quot;Since that decision there have been some expressions of - maybe 
discontent - with that decision (from) the town council,&quot; Bill Steele, 
county administrator, told the board Tuesday.</p> 
<p>In response, the commissioners indicated initial feedback from a number of 
other sources has revealed similar concerns, and that changes may be necessary.
</p> 
<p>While the board took no action to rescind last week's motion to approve the 
proposal, the prevailing sentiment was to wait until after Tuesday night's town 
board meeting and reevaluate the decision accordingly.</p> 
<p>&quot;I, for one, would like to have a united front,&quot; said Alden 
Ecker, board chairman, resurrecting the question of placing the motor vehicle 
tax issue on a separate ballot to be decided in November.</p> 
<p>&quot;If (unity) is not there, the whole thing is an exercise in 
futility,&quot; added Commissioner Bill Downey.</p> 
<p>Along those lines, if sentiments expressed by the town board suggested 
things need a second look, &quot;I'm certainly prepared to reconsider,&quot; 
concluded Commissioner Mamie Lynch. </p> 
<p>If any (or all) of the potential ballot questions get the nod from voters, 
all funds resulting from the additional tax income will be specifically 
allocated to the county's Road and Bridge Capital Improvement Fund.</p> 
<p>On a related note, at Tuesday's regular board meeting, the Pagosa Springs 
Board of Trustees discussed the proposed use tax, but could not come to a 
decision.</p> 
<p>Trustee Darrell Cotton was in favor of leaving all three types of use tax 
on the ballot.</p> 
<p>&quot;It's all a matter of fairness,&quot; he said. &quot;One by itself is 
insignificant.&quot;</p> 
<p>Trustee Bill Whitbred agreed with Cotton in theory; however, he voiced 
concerns about voter response to the automobile use tax.</p> 
<p>&quot;I think if automobiles are on there, it won't pass,&quot; he said. 
&quot;I think we'll lose the whole ball of wax.&quot;</p> 
<p>To iron out the differences, the board asked town staff to set up a 
workshop with county commissioners in the next few days.</p>

<p><b>Health district defaults on inmate care contract</b></p> 
<p><b>By Tom Carosello</b></p> 
<p><b>Staff Writer</b></p> 
<p>Archuleta County commissioners voted Tuesday to ratify action taken by Mary 
Weiss, county attorney, notifying the Upper San Juan Health Service District it 
is in danger of breaching a contract that ensures medical care for county jail 
inmates. </p> 
<p>The board's decision came after Bill Steele, county administrator, notified 
the commissioners the health district is apparently &quot;in default&quot; of 
the terms of an agreement reached between the two entities in mid-February.</p> 
<p>That contract stipulates, among other things, the district &quot;on a 
weekly scheduled basis ... shall provide scheduled appointments to the inmates 
of the Archuleta County Jail.&quot;</p> 
<p>&quot;That has not happened last week, nor the week before that,&quot; said 
Steele, &quot;Technically, that is a violation of the contract.&quot;</p> 
<p>Steele told the board that a letter outlining the violation had been 
drafted by Weiss and sent by fax Monday to Dee Jackson, district manager.</p> 
<p>Steele then requested the board ratify the notification of the default of 
the terms of the contract.</p> 
<p>According to the contract, the district has 10 days from the date of 
notification to &quot;cure&quot; the default before the county can opt to 
cancel the contract as &quot;being materially breached.&quot;</p> 
<p>Steele also recommended that the board withhold half of the $950 monthly 
fee the district charges for the service, and requested he be authorized to 
negotiate with local health professionals to &quot;have someone waiting in the 
wings&quot; in the event the situation is not resolved before the 10-day grace 
period expires.</p> 
<p>&quot;I don't see that we have a lot of choice,&quot; said Commissioner 
Bill Downey, before moving to ratify Weiss' letter notifying the district of 
the default.</p> 
<p>Downey's motion and a subsequent motion by Commissioner Mamie Lynch to 
withhold half of the monthly compensation paid the district both carried 
unanimously. The board also agreed to allow Steele to seek supplemental medical 
assistance from other sources.</p> 
<p>Following the actions, Weiss indicated that even though the health district 
has not recently provided medical service to the jail, a similar contract with 
San Juan Basin Health Department provides for care as well - &quot;So we're not 
completely uncovered,&quot; said Weiss.</p> 
<p>The SUN's request for a response from the health district was sent to 
administration offices Tuesday, and Jackson declined comment on the matter 
Wednesday morning.</p>

<p><b>State tests show local gains; math still weak</b></p> 
<p><b>By Richard Walter</b></p> 
<p><b>Staff Writer</b></p> 
<p>The most intensive testing yet in the Colorado Student Assessment Program 
(CSAP), shows reasonably good performance by most Pagosa Springs students.</p> 
<p>The results were released July 31 reflecting statewide testing assessments 
in English and, at some grade levels, in Spanish.</p> 
<p>In the spring, tests were administered in reading and writing to third 
through 10th grades, mathematics if fifth through 10th grades and science in 
the eighth grade. </p> 
<p>Third-grade reading assessments were release in May and were not a part of 
this testing report.</p> 
<p>However, 87 percent of the third grade students received proficient and 
advanced scores on the reading examination.</p> 
<p>This score represents the highest percentage of students scoring in this 
range since the CSAP testing was first administered in 1997.</p> 
<p>Twenty-two separate assessments were involved in the latest test scoring 
and Pagosa students registered gains in 15 areas measured in the four 
categories.</p> 
<p>Students in third, fourth and fifth grades showed the greatest gains 
overall in reading, writing and math.</p> 
<p>&quot;Students in the sixth, seventh and eighth grades demonstrated mixed 
results in reading, writing and math,&quot; said Superintendent Duane Noggle, 
&quot;while students taking the eighth grade science assessment showed a 
measurable decline when compared to last year's students.&quot;</p> 
<p><b>General results</b></p> 
<p>In the seven grades where reading performance was assessed, results show an 
increase in five, with fifth and ninth grades showing the most dramatic 
improvement. </p> 
<p>&quot;However,&quot; Noggle noted, &quot;when the cohort groups are 
compared (the same students compared to their performance last year instead of 
compared to each other at the same grade level) all grade levels except the 
seventh showed excellent growth. </p> 
<p>&quot;For example,&quot; he pointed out, &quot;when comparing this year's 
fifth grade to last year's fourth grade, there was an increase of 10 percentage 
points in the number of students rated proficient and advanced.&quot;</p> 
<p>Sixth-grade cohorts also showed a 10 percent average gain but seventh 
graders had an 11 percent decline. </p> 
<p>Eighth-grade students demonstrated a huge 17 percentage point increase and 
ninth and tenth grade cohorts each increased as a class by 9 percentage points.
</p> 
<p>In the seven grades at which reading performance was assessed in both 2002 
and 2003, students in Archuleta School District 50 Joint showed gains at 
fourth, fifth, seventh, ninth and 10th-grade levels.</p> 
<p>Sixth and eighth grades each showed a decline in numbers of students 
scoring proficient or advanced. </p> 
<p>Grades five, six, eight, nine and 10 outperformed the state average with 
all other grades near or just a point below the state average.</p> 
<p>The data revealed the most dramatic improvement at the ninth grade level 
with the percentage of students scoring proficient or advanced increasing from 
60 percent in 2002 to 76 percent this year.</p> 
<p>Writing levels</p> 
<p>With the exception of the eighth grade, all those tested showed significant 
improvement this year.</p> 
<p>Third grade, for example, was up from 50 percent proficient or advanced to 
a 65 percent level. Fourth grade was up from 53 to 62, fifth from 38 to 47, 
sixth up from 48 to 49, seventh from 45 to 49, ninth from 43 to 53 and tenth 
from 45 to 52.</p> 
<p>Eighth grade dropped from 55 in 2002 to 44 this year. </p> 
<p><b>Mathematics</b></p> 
<p>Pagosa students seemed somewhat broad-scaled when it came to math results.
</p> 
<p>Fifth grade, for example, was up from 40 to 49 percent proficient and 
advanced, but still below the statewide average of 56 percent.</p> 
<p>Sixth-grade scores dropped from 49 to 41 percent, compared to 50 percent 
statewide.</p> 
<p>Seventh-grade scores were up from 18 to 23 percent, but the statewide 
average is 41 percent.</p> 
<p>Eighth grade was down from 34 to 31 percent while the statewide average was 
38 percent.</p> 
<p>The freshman level was up from 24 to 27 percent, but still below the 
statewide average of 31 percent. </p> 
<p>Sophomores scored 17 percent proficient or advanced, compared to 18 percent 
last year and a 27 percent statewide average.</p> 
<p><b>Science</b></p> 
<p>In science testing, the level at eighth grade dropped from 56 percent in 
2002 to 50 percent this year, but was still above the statewide average of 49 
percent.</p>

<p><b>Monsoon rains expected to return by weekend</b></p> 
<p><b>By Tom Carosello</b></p> 
<p><b>Staff Writer </b></p> 
<p>After a good showing in late July, monsoon rains were temporarily cut off 
from lower elevations across Pagosa Country after an area of high pressure off 
the coast of California moved east and into the Four Corners area last weekend.
</p> 
<p>However, scattered showers are scheduled to make a return to the region as 
early as this afternoon, according to the latest forecasts from the National 
Weather Service.</p> 
<p>&quot;The chance for afternoon showers in southwest Colorado will increase 
a little each day as the weekend approaches,&quot; said Norvan Larson, a 
forecaster with the NWS office in Grand Junction.</p> 
<p>&quot;The area has dried significantly in the past week, but once moisture 
levels build up again there will be a return to normal monsoon patterns across 
most of the Pagosa area.</p> 
<p>&quot;But in the next few days, I would venture to say the chance for rain 
could best be described as 'scattered,' at least until the trough of high 
pressure begins to break down or move out of the area,&quot; added Larson.</p> 
<p>According to Larson, morning sun today will give way to afternoon clouds. A 
20-percent chance for rain is included in the forecast, and high temperatures 
are expected in the upper 80s while lows should fall into the 50s.</p> 
<p>Friday and Saturday call for partly cloudy skies, a 20-percent chance for 
isolated thunderstorms, highs in the upper 80s to low 90s and lows in the 50s.
</p> 
<p>The chance for rain increases to 30-percent for Sunday and Monday, and 
highs each day should stretch into the mid-80s. Nighttime lows are predicted in 
the low 50s.</p> 
<p>The forecasts for Tuesday and Wednesday predict highs in the low to 
mid-80s, a 30- to 40-percent chance for scattered showers and lows in the upper 
40s to low 50s.</p> 
<p>The average high temperature recorded last week at Stevens Field was 82 
degrees. The average low for the week was 50. Precipitation totals for the week 
amounted to approximately six-tenths of an inch.</p> 
<p>The Pagosa Ranger District rates the current regional fire danger as 
&quot;very high.&quot; Fire restrictions across lower elevation zones are 
currently in place. Conditions are subject to change rapidly this time of year; 
for updates and more information, call the district office at 264-2268.</p> 
<p>The National Allergy Bureau rates area pollen counts as 
&quot;moderate&quot; and lists sage, grass and ragweed as the current dominant 
pollens.</p> 
<p>San Juan River flow ranged between approximately 40-110 cubic feet per 
second through town last week. The river's historic median flow for the week of 
Aug. 7 is roughly 140 cubic feet per second.</p>

<p>I will be attending a number of different meetings, with different groups 
trying to raise money in order to have more matching cash funds for our various 
grant applications.</p> 
<p>We met Monday with the Parks and Recreation Advisory Council which voted 
unanimous approval of the plan. We met Tuesday with the Town Board and now will 
go on to private clubs and private parties for pledges for a three-year build 
cycle. </p> 
<p>Cost estimates for the project as drawn will be in sometime this week. My 
estimate for full build-out, in three phases, is around $2.6 million.</p> 
<p>If everything goes well in our fund-raising efforts we may qualify for as 
much as 80-percent funding through different grant sources, particularly GoCo, 
the Colorado Lottery Trust in charge of administrating and overseeing grant 
winners.</p> 
<p>The big &nbsp;grant we are seeking is due Sept. 2. We must line up most of 
our cash match by that time. The minimum to be pledged is $100,000 per year. 
The town, county and school system are looking into a intergovernmental 
agreement that will help fund our percentage of the match.</p>

<p><b>Eleven golfers strive for PSHS varsity slots</b></p> 
<p><b>By Richard Walter</b></p> 
<p><b>Staff Writer</b></p> 
<p>It is a senior-laden squad, but the numbers are limited.</p> 
<p>Coaches Mark Faber and Tom Riedberger welcomed the Pagosa Springs High 
School golf team hopefuls for their first practice Monday.</p> 
<p>And they were a little surprised at the low turnout: 11 candidates for 
varsity action - action which will test their mettle long before any of their 
other classmates are even in school.</p> 
<p>Seniors include Ty Faber, the only candidate who made the regionals last 
year; Matt Lattin, Jake Mackensen (who won a tournament last year in South Fork 
but did not play regularly with the varsity); Steven Sellers and Casey Belarde, 
both of whom were varsity performers last year; and Craig Lucero who was 
present but doesn't yet have clearance to play because of a dislocated elbow.
</p> 
<p>The lone female candidate for the squad is sophomore Samantha Ricker. 
Others are Tom Huggins who played varsity last year in Gunnison, Damian Rome, 
Niko Carrizo and Ben DeVoti.</p> 
<p>Coaches told the squad they will practice daily at 5:30 p.m. and &quot;be 
prepared to stay here until dark.&quot; </p> 
<p>If there is bad weather, they will work on conditioning, game rules and 
study course layouts inside.</p> 
<p>And just nine days after the first workout, the squad will open (varsity 
only) at the Dalton Ranch tournament in Durango, go right back to Durango the 
next day to play a tournament at Hillcrest and then come back for their only 
home appearance of the year, the Pagosa Invitational, on Aug. 15.</p> 
<p>Each player was warned that prep tournament play requires collared shirts 
with tails tucked in at all times.</p> 
<p>And coach Faber emphasized the game is one of frustration, but of etiquette.
</p> 
<p>&quot;Don't get down on yourself for a missed shot,&quot; he stressed. 
&quot;And don't chide an opponent. Know and observe the rules of golf and if 
you're not sure, ask a coach. If we don't know the answer, we'll find it.&quot;
</p> 
<p>Even in practice, he told the squad, &quot;you will share score cards. 
Honesty will be a byword for this team.</p> 
<p>&quot;You are representing Pagosa Springs High School wherever we 
play,&quot; he said, &quot;and that's an honor. It means something to be a team 
member.&quot;</p> 
<p>The squad will have an overnight trip Aug. 20-21, playing at Delta the 
first day and Montrose the second. The following day the Pirates are due in 
Cortez and may just go there from Montrose.</p> 
<p>They are scheduled in Monte Vista Sept. 3, but may send the junior varsity 
to that tourney and have the varsity participate in Alamosa which is where the 
state tournament will be staged Sept. 29 and 30.</p> 
<p>Other games on the schedule, all on the road, are Sept. 5 at Kirtland, N.M. 
(varsity and junior varsity both); Sept. 8 at Ridgway (four golfers only); 
Sept. 12 at Crested Butte (both teams) and regionals Sept. 16 at Desert Hawk in 
Pueblo (four golfers only).</p> 
<p>Faber said it is possible other would-be team members were out of town or 
unable to get away from work for the first day of practice.</p> 
<p>&quot;However,&quot; he added, &quot;we have a good core group here and 
this is the hand we'll play.&quot;</p> 
<p>He said the weekly players for varsity will be determined on practice 
action, head-to-head competition and scoring.</p> 
<p>Finally, Faber told the squad there &quot;is no reason we can't send a full 
team to regionals and state. We need only to concentrate on our goals and 
perform to the best of our ability.&quot;</p> 
<p>&quot;Numbers are not the important factor,&quot; he said. &quot;Desire 
is.&quot;</p>

<p><b>Softball Blowout nets at least $1,000 for baseball backstop</b></p> 
<p><b>By Richard Walter</b></p> 
<p><b>Staff Writer</b></p> 
<p>A major league net style backstop should grace the Pagosa Springs High 
School baseball field by spring. </p> 
<p>And it will all be thanks to a big Blowout. Not a tire. Not a riot. Not an 
oil well eruption.</p> 
<p>Nope, this was the 20th annual Softball Blowout, an end of season tradition 
in Pagosa Springs for major softball teams from across the Four Corners area.
</p> 
<p>Organized and conducted by Sue Jones of the town's parks and recreation 
department, the tournament regularly focuses all proceeds on a school district 
need.</p> 
<p>In the past it has been scoring machines for the junior high school, 
wrestling equipment for the high school, or football gear.</p> 
<p>This year's tournament beneficiary will be the high school baseball team.
</p> 
<p>And, though costs for prizes and officials were up this year and the number 
of teams down slightly, at least $1,000 will be donated for the backstop 
project, Jones said. </p> 
<p>She noted the tournament drew a record five local teams this year.</p> 
<p>Winning the men's division, going undefeated, was Worth of Farmington. 
Second was Ken's Performance of Pagosa and third went to Silver Fox of Alamosa.
</p> 
<p>Short Circuits of Farmington, also undefeated, captured the women's 
division. A-Team of Albuquerque was second and Ribbons of Albuquerque, a first- 
time entry in the Blowout, was third.</p> 
<p>In all, the tournament drew 27 teams this year, 11 in the women's bracket.
</p> 
<p>Jones said plaudits need to go to Joe Lister Jr. who single-handedly got 
field three in playable condition. She also cited grounds control activities by 
Chris Corcoran, Jim Shaffer and Dylan Pruitt.</p> 
<p>At the same time, members of the high school baseball team, coach Tony 
Scarpa and team parents worked the entire tournament picking up trash, keeping 
barrels emptied and Dumpsters filled.</p> 
<p>David Belarde was chief umpire and coordinated all actions on field.</p> 
<p>Volunteers who contributed to success of the project, Jones said, include 
Fred Manzanares, Everett and Jeremy Coen, Lucas Jones, Andy Gonzales and Ricky 
Ochoa and Virginia Manzanares, who did all the pre and postgame bookwork.</p> 
<p>After the now famous &quot;mud bowl&quot; of last year, Jones said, &quot;I 
was prepared for the worst and woke up at 3:30 Saturday prepared to go out and 
start rebuilding fields.</p> 
<p>&quot;I was surprised to find clear skies and stars shining,&quot; she 
said, and &quot;knew we'd get the games in with a minimum of delay.&quot;</p> 
<p>In fact, the only threat came late Saturday when heavy rains fell for about 
10 minutes, but &quot;the teams and umpires kept it going,&quot; Jones said.</p>
<p>The three fields in use all absorbed the rainfall completely and games 
early Sunday were on dry surfaces.</p> 
<p>And now Jones has only to wait until late summer 2004 for Blowout 21.</p> 
<p>&quot;Some didn't want to wait,&quot; she said. &quot;Eight teams already 
have signed up for next year. One even wanted to pay in advance but we couldn't 
accept that.&quot;</p> 
<p>Still, she said, &quot;It's nice to know the people want to come here. We 
do it as the same time as the county fair and it draws more spending for 
everyone.&quot;</p>

<p><b>Harold Clevenger</b></p> 
<p>Harold &quot;Red&quot; Clevenger died unexpectedly July 29, 2003, at the 
Western Arizona Regional Medical Center in Bullhead City, Ariz., of a heart 
attack following a successful arterial graft to his right leg.</p> 
<p>Red was a resident of Bullhead City since July of 2000 but he, his wife and 
their six daughters were residents of Pagosa Springs, Colo., from 1968 to 1988.
</p> 
<p>Red was born Sept. 28, 1928. His parents, Jeff and Oma Clevenger, both of 
Tulia, Texas, preceded him in death. He is survived by four siblings; Jethan 
George of Booker, Texas; Daryl Clevenger of Hart, Texas; Whister Clevenger of 
Runaway Bay, Texas; and Vonda Woolsey of Amarillo, Texas.</p> 
<p>He is survived by his wife of 50 years, Wilhelmina &quot;Goomie&quot; 
Clevenger. They raised six daughters, one of whom, Susan Desiree 'Desi' 
preceded him in death in 1982. Five surviving daughters and their families are 
Jennifer Virginia &quot;GeeGee&quot; Gallegos and her husband, Robert, of 
Bullhead City; Kindra Kay &quot;Kindy&quot; Martinez and her husband, Leonard, 
of Albuquerque; Oma Jetuan &quot;Tonnie&quot; Taylor of Artesia, N.M., Rosemary 
Zabrina &quot;Zebbie&quot; Bowden and her husband, Ridge of Ruidoso, N.M., and 
Felicia Coleen &quot;Lisa&quot; Clevenger of Bullhead City; grandchildren 
Jedeka and Terry Hamilton of Las Vegas, Nev., Robert Gallegos Jr. of Las Vegas, 
Palmira, Estrella and Jose Martinez of Albuquerque; Dominic Trujillo and Barb 
Long of Klamath Falls, Ore.; Tawny Trujillo of Bullhead City; Stephen Hatch of 
Portales, N.M.; Tristan Bowden of Ruidoso; and Jade Michael Clevenger of 
Bullhead City.</p> 
<p>Besides being a loving father, brother, husband, and grandfather, Red was 
an avid outdoorsman and worked for many years as a Linotype operator for the 
Durango Herald, the Rocky Mountain News, the Denver Post and the Pagosa Springs 
SUN.</p> 
<p>He was also a successful bidder/contractor as well as a carpet installer in 
the Pagosa Springs and Dulce areas. As a sportsman, he was well known for his 
love of fishing for catfish, hunting for pheasant or dove, the Denver Broncos 
(a lot) and perhaps the Dallas Cowboys (at times), was growing to appreciate 
the Arizona Diamondbacks, won his fair share of pool tournaments and seldom 
passed up a good game of cribbage.</p> 
<p>All who knew and loved him will miss Red. The family held a memorial 
service for the immediate family on Friday, Aug. 1, 2003, in Bullhead City. His 
ashes will be enshrined in Pagosa Springs, in the mountains he dearly loved, 
next to his daughter.</p> 
<p>A celebration of his life is planned Saturday, Aug. 9, 2003, at 10:30 a.m. 
in Immaculate Heart of Mary Catholic Church. His family invites all his friends 
in this area to join them for this celebration to be followed by a luncheon at 
the Parish Hall.</p>

<p><b>Mountain Express begins Saturday service Aug. 9</b></p> 
<p><b>By Tom Carosello</b></p> 
<p><b>Staff Writer</b></p> 
<p>Barring any unforeseen circumstances, Aug. 9 will mark the beginning of a 
new era for public transportation in Archuleta County when Mountain Express 
initiates Saturday bus service for the first time in its history.</p> 
<p>According to Dave Sedgwick, county transportation director, as long as 
ridership is favorable, Mountain Express will continue to provide Saturday 
service on all but one of its eight runs between the hours of 6 a.m.-6 p.m.</p> 
<p>&quot;Unfortunately, we will not be providing service on run No. 8 on 
Saturdays,&quot; said Sedgwick, &quot;But otherwise we plan on running the 
service the same hours one would expect to see during the week.&quot;</p> 
<p>Honoring a request from Sedgwick, the county board of commissioners voted 
unanimously to approve the extension of Mountain Express service to weekends 
during its July 22 meeting.</p> 
<p>At that time, Sedgwick told the board he felt the extension would be well 
received by the public and expected to fill a void, especially among those who 
need transportation back and forth between jobs.</p> 
<p>Enthusiasm for the expansion, among both the public and the transportation 
department, has not waned in the meantime, said Sedgwick.</p> 
<p>&quot;We continue to get a lot of positive feedback from the community, and 
we are certainly excited to get Saturday service up and running,&quot; said 
Sedgwick.</p> 
<p>Sedgwick also indicated the extended service will be evaluated on a regular 
basis. If interest in Saturday service diminishes, the commissioners can decide 
whether to modify operating hours or eliminate service altogether, explained 
Sedgwick.</p> 
<p>In addition to the preparations initiated by Sedgwick, the expansion of 
service was made possible through funding provisions of the federal Job Access 
Reverse Commute Grant program.</p> 
<p>Funds from the program, which are also known as JARC grants, are primarily 
aimed at improving a community's ability to provide residents with 
transportation to and from job sites.</p> 
<p>The county has been awarded $85,887 in JARC grants for the operation of 
Mountain Express since applying for the funds in 2001.</p>

<p><b>New fire suppression system</b></p> 
<p><b>first of its kind in the county</b></p> 
<p><b>By Richard Walter</b></p> 
<p><b>Staff Writer</b></p> 
<p>There are fire suppression sprinkler systems in many Archuleta County 
structures.</p> 
<p>But none like the one being built into the Weddle home under construction 
in Holiday Acres.</p> 
<p>This two-story home, still in the interior framing stage, will have a 
direct feed pressure fire suppression system operating directly off the home's 
water supply system.</p> 
<p>Fire Chief Warren Grams of the Pagosa Fire Protection District said it is 
the first system of its kind in the county.</p> 
<p>All others, he said while inspecting the Weddle site for pressure flow, 
have hard pipe systems installed after construction.</p> 
<p>This system keeps the tubing inside the walls and is instantly activated by 
a 130-degree sensor in the hidden extinguisher heads.</p> 
<p>Doug Lenberg of Durango, assisting in the inspection, said this new system, 
first installed in a Ute subdivision in Ignacio, and later in about 20 new 
homes in Durango, has a cost factor of about $1.25 per square foot as compared 
to a regular suppression system with a cost of about $3 per square foot.</p> 
<p>Tying the system directly into the all-house water line ensures totally 
enclosed free flow and keeps pressure constant.</p> 
<p>As construction continues, the heads for each specified area will appear as 
slight drops from the ceilings.</p> 
<p>To date, they said as they prepared for a flow test, only Colorado and New 
Mexico have codes allowing this type of installation.</p> 
<p>Sensor units in each room are independent of one another and will activate 
separately, depending on degree of heat emitted and the source of that emission.
</p> 
<p>The 30-second test showed a flow of nearly 17 gallons per minute through a 
single suppression head, enough to extinguish a blaze in a 20 by 20 foot area.
</p> 
<p>Grams said the new technique appears to be the model system for new 
construction and was impressed by the pressure of flow.</p> 
<p>The Weddle home will feature 28 suppression heads, 14 on each floor, all 
interlinked through half-inch tubing and presenting constant flow pressure at 
each outlet point.</p> 
<p>The system keeps fresh water moving from the manifolds to the fittings each 
time water is drawn by any cold water plumbing fixture (faucet, toilet, etc.) 
assuring the suppression system is always activated - unless water to the home, 
itself, should be shut off.</p> 
<p>Rarely, installers said, will more than two heads activate at once because 
the single head nearest the fire will normally accomplish extermination of 
flame.</p>

<p><b>Pagosan victimized by on-line scam </b></p> 
<p><b>By Tess Noel Baker</b></p> 
<p><b>Staff Writer</b></p> 
<p>The information superhighway still has its rough spots -&nbsp;scams that 
can trip a person into giving up all of their personal and financial 
information.</p> 
<p>One Pagosa resident was recently victimized by such a scam - a PayPal scam.
</p> 
<p>PayPal is a well-known online payment service. Scammers create Internet or 
e-mail messages that replicate the authentic PayPal site in order to trick 
people into releasing personal and financial information.</p> 
<p>Pagosa Springs Police Investigator Scott Maxwell said the Pagosa resident's 
credit card information, Social Security number and bank account information 
was compromised by such a scam. Luckily, the authentic PayPal site somehow 
learned the information had been compromised and alerted the person who was 
able to cancel the credit cards and change the bank account number before any 
harm was done.</p> 
<p>&quot;Apparently this is a pretty common scam,&quot; Maxwell said. When one 
copycat site is found and shut down, a new one takes its place.</p> 
<p>PayPal scams are presented in two versions - a Web site version and an 
e-mail version. According to www.fightidentitytheft.com, an identity theft 
watchdog site, one PayPal scam site that has been found and shut down read like 
this:</p> 
<p>&quot;Dear PayPal user,</p> 
<p>Today we had some trouble with one of our computer systems. While the 
trouble appears to be minor, we are not taking any chances. We decided to take 
the troubled system offline and replace it with a new system. Unfortunately, 
this caused us to lose some member data. Please follow the link below and log 
into your account to make sure your information is not affected. Account 
balances have not been affected.&quot;</p> 
<p>One of the e-mail scams tells the customers that PayPal is performing 
regular maintenance on its security measures and has placed the customer's 
account on limited access status. To restore the account completely, the 
customer is required to reenter some financial information. This information 
includes: name, address, phone number, PayPal login and password, credit card 
numbers, expiration and security number, Social Security number, date of birth, 
mother's maiden name, bank account number, pin and routing number.</p> 
<p>One way to catch some of these scams is to pay close attention to the 
address bar located at the top of the Internet screen. This is especially 
important when linking to the Internet from an e-mail message.</p> 
<p>For instance, PayPal suggests that users only enter their PayPal password 
and other information on pages where the URL begins exactly with 
https://www.paypal.com/. Even if the URL contains the word &quot;PayPal,&quot; 
it may be a scam. For instance, former scams have included addresses like: 
www.paypalnet.com, www.paypa1.com, www.paypal secure.com.</p>

<p><b>West Nile Virus draws closer; </b></p> 
<p><b>health pros give protection tips</b></p> 
<p>Three horses in the southeastern part of La Plata County and one bird in 
the city of Durango have tested positive for West Nile virus.</p> 
<p>San Juan Basin Health Department is encouraging residents to submit birds 
for testing for West Nile virus. Testing is restricted to corvids that have 
died in the last 48 hours, including: ravens, crows, magpies and jays (stellar, 
blue, gray, western scrub and pinon).</p> 
<p>Stiff or maggot-infested birds cannot be tested. Call the health department 
at 247-5702 to report the address where the bird has been found and for further 
instructions on submitting birds.</p> 
<p>Larvacides are still the preferred method of mosquito control. BTI 
larvacides called &quot;mosquito dunks,&quot; a naturally occurring bacteria 
that is safe for plants, other useful insects, pets and humans, are available 
at San Juan Basin Health Department. BTI is effective for 30 days.</p> 
<p>Altosid briquettes can also be used. They are effective for 150 days and 
are available through Animas Mosquito Control District.</p> 
<p>If you live in an area of heavy mosquito infestation want to spray your 
property call Frank Ratliff of Archuleta County Weed and Pest Control at 
264-6773 for information regarding larvacide application. Pagosa Springs does 
not have a mosquito control district which sprays.</p> 
<p>There has been a rapid increase in the number of human cases of West Nile 
virus in Colorado, particularly along the Front Range and in the Eastern 
Plains. San Juan Basin Health Department reminds community members to protect 
themselves and their families from the disease.</p> 
<p>Of every five infected people, only one will have any symptoms of the 
virus. For those with symptoms, most will have West Nile Fever, a mild illness 
lasting three-to-six days.</p> 
<p>Symptoms start suddenly after a usual two- to 14-day incubation period and 
include headache, muscle aches and rash. Some people also may have nausea and 
vomiting.</p> 
<p>Only one out of 150 infected people will develop severe neurological 
disease with meningitis or encephalitis. The risk of severe disease increases 
with age. In addition to other symptoms, these people will have a stiff neck, 
more severe headache and vomiting, weakness and other neurological symptoms. 
Most of these people will be hospitalized for supportive care.</p> 
<p>Persons over 50 years of age should be particularly vigilant in protecting 
themselves from the disease because older persons tend to become sicker if they 
contract the virus and can die from it.</p> 
<p>Prevention tips:</p> 
<p>- dress in light-colored clothes with long sleeves and long pants to avoid 
mosquito bites</p> 
<p>- avoid being outside at dawn and dusk when mosquitoes are most active, and 
steer clear of shrubs where they hide. If you need to be outside during these 
hours, use DEET topically and/or Permethrin, which is available from local 
sporting goods stores for spraying on your clothing</p> 
<p>- when using insect repellent containing DEET, always follow label 
instructions. Products with 10 percent or less DEET are recommended for children
</p> 
<p>- drain all standing water, no matter how small an amount, including tires, 
cans, flowerpots, clogged rain gutters, kiddie pools, and puddles where 
mosquitoes lay eggs. Trim grass and shrubs and don't over water lawns and 
gardens.</p> 
<p>Horses</p> 
<p>It is not too late to vaccinate your horses against West Nile. Contact your 
local veterinarian to discuss obtaining the vaccination or other methods you 
might use to protect your horses.</p> 
<p>For more information, call the San Juan Basin Health Department at 
247-5702. The &quot;Colorado Health Education Line for the Public&quot; 
(CO-HELP), (877) 462-2911, will be staffed daily 7 a.m.-11 p.m. with operators 
providing information on symptoms and infection in humans and animals.</p>

<p><b>Fire restrictions still in effect on public lands in region</b></p> 
<p><b>By Pamella Wilson</b></p> 
<p><b>Special to The SUN</b></p> 
<p>Federal and local fire managers have decided to keep current fire 
restrictions in place for at least another week.</p> 
<p>While Southwest Colorado has begun to receive much-needed and 
much-appreciated precipitation, it has been localized with some areas receiving 
several inches and other areas receiving considerably less.</p> 
<p>Fire managers continue to monitor fuel conditions on public lands, and are 
also checking with the National Weather Service on long-range forecast 
potential to see if fire restrictions can be lifted in the near future.</p> 
<p>&quot;We really appreciate how careful the public has been with fire this 
year,&quot; said Mark Lauer, fire management officer for the San Juan Public 
Lands.</p> 
<p>&quot;Firefighters have responded to more than 350 fires this season and 
more than 95 percent of those have been caused by Mother Nature, not by 
humans.&quot;</p> 
<p>Fire managers want to be relatively confident that the area is not moving 
back into a warm, dry spell and that rains will continue before lifting the 
restrictions.</p> 
<p>However, in the meantime, the following restrictions still apply to San 
Juan National Forest and BLM lands, including Canyons of the Ancients National 
Monument, in Zone 1 or the lower-elevation zone.</p> 
<p>On the east side of U.S. 550, Zone 1 includes all Forest Service lands 
outside of the Weminuche and South San Juan Wildernesses.</p> 
<p>On the west side of U.S. 550, Zone 1 includes Forest Service lands in the 
lower Hermosa, Junction Creek, La Plata Canyon, Echo Basin, Haycamp Mesa, 
McPhee Reservoir, Narraguinnep, and Glade areas. Visit a local Public Lands 
Office for a more detailed description and/or map.</p> 
<p>Restrictions include: Campfires are allowed only in permanent fire rings or 
fire grates within developed recreation sites; smoking is allowed only inside 
an enclosed vehicle or building or in an area cleared of vegetation and at 
least 3 feet in diameter; the use of explosives, welding or acetylene or other 
torch with an open flame is prohibited; and fireworks, as always are completely 
prohibited.</p> 
<p>In addition, campfires are completely prohibited in the following 
campgrounds:</p> 
<p>- McPhee Reservoir: McPhee and House Creek Campgrounds</p> 
<p>- Dolores River Canyon; Metaska Picnic Area; Cabin Canyon, Ferris Canyon, 
and Bradfield Bridge Campgrounds; and Box Elder Recreation Area</p> 
<p>- Dolores Canyon Rim: Dolores River Overlook</p> 
<p>- Mancos Area: Target Tree and Transfer Campgrounds</p> 
<p>Archuleta, La Plata, and Montezuma Counties also have restrictions on open 
burning in effect, though burning may be allowed on a case-by-case basis.</p> 
<p>Fire restrictions also remain in effect in Mesa Verde National Park.</p>

<p><b>Monsoon spurs trout activity in area reservoirs</b></p> 
<p><b>By Tom Carosello</b></p> 
<p><b>Staff Writer</b> </p> 
<p>Monsoon rains have officially begun in Pagosa Country, and while heavy 
runoff temporarily reduces visibility in area tributaries, reservoir anglers 
are benefitting from supplemental flows and the cooling effects brought on by 
afternoon rains.</p> 
<p>Dawn and dusk continue to be the most active times for cold-water species, 
but trout will briefly move into the shallows to feed when spurred by increased 
oxygen levels and lower water temperatures resulting from periods of heavy rain.
</p> 
<p>Unless completely blown out by runoff, streams and rivers will continue to 
offer steady action throughout the rainy season as well, especially during 
intermittent days when clarity returns to near normal.</p> 
<p>Flash flooding is always a potential danger during monsoon season - anglers 
should avoid areas that are prone to excessive runoff and vacate narrow canyons 
at the first sign of approaching thunderstorms.</p> 
<p>The following is a breakdown of conditions at some regional fishing 
hotspots:</p> 
<p>- Navajo Reservoir - Surface level is listed at an elevation of 6,007 feet 
and water temperature is in the 70s. Catfish continue to be active day and 
night, regularly hitting blood/stink baits. Fishing for smallmouths, 
largemouths crappie and northern pike is reported as fair.</p> 
<p>- San Juan River (through town) - Flows are averaging about 40-50 cubic 
feet per second but will spike with runoff. River is off color at times, but 
successful anglers are using spinners, flies, salmon eggs and streamers to 
catch rainbows and an occasional brown.</p> 
<p>- Echo Lake - Aquatic plant growth is hindering shoreline anglers in 
shallow areas, but largemouth bass, crappie, small sunfish and perch are being 
taken on live bait, ultralight jigs and small plastics. Trout have reportedly 
been more active in the past two weeks and will hit flies, marabou jigs, flashy 
spinners, salmon eggs, worms, cheese and PowerBait.</p> 
<p>- Williams Creek Reservoir - Anglers seeking rainbow, cutthroat and brook 
trout are reporting fair to good catches with live bait, PowerBait, light jigs 
in orange and yellow, and spinners in gold, silver and bright fluorescents. 
Kokanee fishing continues to be described as slow.</p> 
<p>- Big Meadows Reservoir - Fishing is good near the creek inlets and 
improving in the deeper areas of the lake. Brook trout are reportedly the 
predominant catch and are hitting PowerBait, flies and spinners.</p> 
<p>- East Fork of San Juan - Flows varying with runoff from afternoon rains. 
Fishing for pan-sized rainbows and browns through the isolated stretches is 
fair to good.</p> 
<p>- Piedra River - Clarity is affected by afternoon runoff, but river is 
fishing well in most sections. Browns and rainbows are the predominant catch 
and are hitting flies, streamers and flashy spinners.</p> 
<p>- Middle Fork, Piedra River - Very low; fish are easily spooked, but small 
browns and rainbows are occasionally being taken on flies and small jigs and 
spinners.</p> 
<p>- Fourmile Creek - Flow may be off color depending on rains, but brook 
trout and cutthroats continue to hit attractor-pattern flies and lightweight 
spinners in the upper sections near the falls.</p> 
<p>- Williams Creek - Fishing pressure has eased a bit near the campgrounds, 
but fishing in more remote sections of the creek continues to prove worthwhile. 
Flies and small spinners are working well for brookies, cutthroats, browns and 
rainbows near the dam, while browns and rainbows are the main catch in the 
lower stretch.</p>

<p>Bob Huff, cowboy poet, will share stories of the trail Saturday night.</p> 
<p>Author of &quot;Tracks Along the Trail, Cowboy Poetry from the San Juan 
Mountains&quot; and &quot;More Tracks Along the Trail,&quot; Huff and his wife, 
Mary Ann, live on 75 acres along Martinez Canyon north of Pagosa Springs. 
Before retirement, Huff was a university professor and administrator in 
Colorado, New Mexico and Arizona. Since retirement, he keeps a few yearlings, 
enjoys his horses, and is active at cowboy poetry gatherings.</p> 
<p>In his spare time, he has been a great help as a volunteer for the Pagosa 
Ranger District of the San Juan National Forest. He helps pack equipment and 
supplies into backcountry trail crews and keeps an eye on the range. Huff says 
he gets to ride in nice places and watch other people work. He helped lay out 
and now maintains a ski trail in the Turkey Springs area.</p> 
<p>And he shares his cowboy poetry. Those who attend will hang on to his words 
with anticipation, laugh, reminisce, sigh and perhaps get a tear in the eye.</p>
<p>Enjoy the evening with Huff Saturday at 7:30 p.m. at the Teal Boat Ramp 
overlooking Williams Reservoir north of Pagosa Springs.</p> 
<p>Dress warmly and bring a chair, blanket, and flashlight. Allow 45 minutes

<p><b>Leftover big game licenses will go on sale Aug. 12</b></p> 
<p>Limited leftover big game licenses for the 2003-2004 Colorado big game 
seasons will go on sale at all Division of Wildlife offices across the state 
beginning at 8 a.m. Aug. 12.</p> 
<p>Leftover licenses from the limited license drawings earlier this year will 
be sold.</p> 
<p>For a list of the licenses, visit the DOW Web site at wildlife. 
state.co.us//leftoverlicenses/list.pdf, or visit a DOW service center. Licenses 
remain for fall turkey, antelope, bear, deer and elk.</p> 
<p>&quot;As we transition into a new licensing system it is very important 
that hunters make sure their license records are updated, especially for the 
leftover license sale,&quot; said Steve Yamashita, northwest assistant regional 
manager for the DOW. &quot;The best way to do this is stop by or call a local 
office prior to Aug. 12 and talk with a customer service representative.&quot;
</p> 
<p>Hunters' records are kept in the Colorado Outdoor Recreation Information 
System. License buyers who have changed an address, name or driver's license or 
who have duplicate records in the system should contact the DOW before the 
leftover license sale.</p> 
<p>In addition, some DOW offices will be open prior to 8 a.m. on Aug. 12 to 
update records before licenses are sold.</p>

the state, except at the Denver, Brush and Fort Collins offices where 
randomly-numbered wristbands will be issued to customers to determine their 
place in line.</p> 
<p>The wristband procedure negates the need for customers to arrive in the 
pre-dawn hours at these popular offices to secure a place in line. The first 
group of wristbands will be issued starting at 5:30 a.m. in Brush and 6 a.m. in 
Denver and Fort Collins. A second group of wristbands will be issued at all 
three offices beginning at 7:45 a.m.</p>

<p><b>Parents can help relieve a child's stress at school</b></p> 
<p>The first few weeks of school can be anxious, stressful periods as students 
adjust to the changes that come with each new school year. They make a host of 
decisions as they adjust to a new academic and social climate, and possibly 
even to a new school.</p> 
<p>Parents can help their children deal with the stress of a new school year, 
says Lisa Boyum, Ph.D. , a pediatric and adolescent psychologist at National 
Jewish Medical and Research Center in Denver.</p> 
<p>&quot;The first and most important step is listening to your child,&quot; 
said Dr. Boyum. &quot;It underlies everything else. Sometimes listening is 
enough to initiate the changes you want.&quot;</p> 
<p>Dr. Boyum has several tips for parents who want to help their children cope 
with the stresses of school: </p> 
<p>- Break bread together. Eating together is extremely important and helpful 
on many levels. It gives parents and children a chance to talk about the day 
and the issues that came up. Just talking about a particular concern can often 
help children find the answers they need.</p> 
<p>In addition, interactions at the dinner table help children practice their 
communication and social skills. Good dinner conversations also help parents 
better monitor what their children are doing and the issues they are facing. 
Research has shown that students who eat regular meals with their families have 
better social skills, do better in school and, according to their teachers, are 
better socially adjusted.</p> 
<p>- Create opportunities to listen. In addition to mealtime it is valuable to 
create other opportunities for your children to share things that are on their 
minds. Regular, predictable activities with their parents, such as driving to 
school, walking the dog, or washing the dishes, give children opportunities to 
talk. Children often feel more comfortable bringing up difficult topics if the 
activity has a finite length that limits potentially unpleasant conversations.
</p> 
<p>- Don't rush your answer. Many parents want to respond immediately to a 
child's questions and concerns. In fact, they often dive right in, interrupting 
the child to offer advice or analysis. But that can irritate a child who thinks 
a parent is lecturing rather than listening. &quot;It can be okay not to have 
an answer immediately,&quot; said Dr. Boyum. &quot;It's more important to let 
the child get things out.&quot; If you don't have the answer, let your child 
know you have heard him or her and want to think about it before coming to any 
conclusions.</p> 
<p>- You're not alone. Reassure your child that he or she is not the only 
student worried about how his or her clothes look or getting to class on time. 
Other students are struggling with the same worries. It can help even more if 
you have a story about your own fears and mistakes when you were a student.</p> 
<p>You survived them, and so will your child. </p>

<p><b>Noise law</b></p> 
<p>Dear Editor:</p> 
<p>We can thank our county commissioners for passing a much-needed noise 
ordinance. I think it should serve us well. The citizens who participated in 
the process deserve kudos, as well. It took a collaborative effort to achieve 
this success.</p> 
<p>Richard Walter's article on the noise ordinance contained an error I would 
like to address. His statement was, &quot;In general, maximum noise levels will 
be 80 decibels from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. and 75 decibels from 7 p.m. to 7 
a.m.&quot; This is incorrect, in that it is only a reference to partial 
exceptions made for construction, demolition, and fire maintenance projects on 
weekdays.</p> 
<p>To summarize the effects of this law on a person who lives in a 
subdivision, or within 500 feet of a permanent residential building, the 
following maximum permissible noise levels apply:</p> 
<p>Maximum noise on weekdays from 7 a.m. to next 7 p.m. is 55 decibels, and 
from 7 p.m. to next 7 a.m. is 50 decibels; on weekends, the timeframes for 
those maximums shall be shortened to 8 a.m. to 7 p.m. In the case of a 
complaint, these sound measurements would be taken at a distance of 25 feet 
from the noise source. There are exceptions and one should review the new law 
to fully understand what noisemaking will be considered acceptable.</p> 
<p>I don't have an example of what 50-55 decibels of noise would be, but Sue 
Walan, the county engineer, took some sound readings and said that a quiet 
office or quiet rural road was the equivalent of 35-40 decibels, while downtown 
traffic or a passing automobile measured from 10 feet away gave a reading of 
70-75 decibels. Construction site earthwork at 5 feet away ranged from 90-105 
decibels.</p> 
<p>For visitors, newcomers, and history buffs, the noise ordinance is just one 
of the &quot;visions&quot; expressed by the many Archuletans who participated 
in the 22 public workshops, resulting in an Archuleta Community Plan, adopted 
in spring 2001. In June 2001, the county commissioners chose junk/nuisance, 
right-to-farm, and noise as their top three priorities for community plan 
implementation. The planning department selected lighting, signage, and 
landscaping as their priorities. Last year, the planning department succeeded 
in getting both the lighting and signage ordinances adopted by the 
commissioners. In January 2002, Attorney Weiss stated in a Board of County 
Commissioners meeting, that a junk/nuisance ordinance was only a couple weeks 
away from commissioners' review. To date, and to the best of my knowledge, the 
noise ordinance is the first commissioner-initiated effort toward community 
plan implementation that has materialized.</p> 
<p>I appreciate this successful beginning effort, and hope all interested 
citizens will renew their individual efforts toward ensuring a sustainable 
future for our community. Please call our commissioners at their new phone 
number, 264-8300, and thank them for this achievement, and let them know what 
you feel should be next on the community plan implementation priority schedule.
</p>

<p><b>Unhealthy lake</b></p> 
<p>Dear Editor:</p> 
<p>We moved here to beautiful Pagosa Springs several years ago for a number of 
reasons, one very important reason ... healthy environment. Healthy environment 
includes clean air, many outdoor activities, beautiful lakes, streams and 
rivers to fish in ... with the exception of one lake.</p> 
<p>Village Lake is ostensibly full of trout, bass and other species of fish, 
but how can that be possible? Fish cannot thrive in a mudflat; they may exist, 
but most definitely cannot thrive in the existing environment.</p> 
<p>The poor creatures are wallowing in mud, not swimming freely in a healthy 
amount of water, due to the fact that this lake has been allowed to reach a 
disgusting minimum level of 60 inches below the spillway. In addition to the 
negative impact on fishing, the low lake level has also impacted the habitats 
of other local wildlife.</p> 
<p>Isn't that why most of us chose to live here? For the unsurpassed beauty, 
the healthy environment, the outdoor recreation, the wildlife? We understand 
that aesthetics is on the bottom of the list for PAWS ... we do truly 
understand this. We understand that drinking water and water for home use must 
come first and that irrigation water comes second, aesthetics last.</p> 
<p>But surely health should fit into the plan as well. How healthy is it to 
have a lake that is so dangerously low that it smells of rotten, dead fish and 
sour silt and sludge? The waterfowl, especially the ducks, are constantly 
becoming entangled in old discarded fishing lines and other debris that was 
once at the bottom of the lake but is now on dry land, as the water has receded.
</p> 
<p>Sure, the debris can be cleaned up and those of us who live near or on the 
lake do clean it up. But we cannot clean up silt and sludge and the rotten sour 
smell. We also cannot clean up the infestations of mosquitoes, which, as we are 
all aware, can create quite a health hazard with the West Nile Virus. The only 
thing to remedy these problems is to pump water into the lake to bring it to a 
reasonably healthy level, as are all of the other lakes.</p> 
<p>Our entire community is impacted by this problem. Imagine that you are a 
tourist staying here in one of the many timeshares on this lake; what would 
your reaction be? Sure, you could play golf, but not everyone plays golf. Many 
of these tourists like to fish, and even more like to just enjoy looking at the 
lake and taking a stroll around it. Even the golfers have to look at it and 
smell it as they play in the area.</p> 
<p>We talk with many of these tourists as they walk by where we live, and we 
hear them voice their disgust with the pathetic condition of the lake; no, they 
won't be back. Nor will they recommend Pagosa to friends or relatives. This 
impacts the overall economy of Pagosa, as tourism is a major source of revenue.
</p> 
<p>Terry and Marsha Baker</p> 
<p>Editor's note: According to Joe Fowler, a San Juan Basin Health 
epidemiologist, shallow water, measured in inches is a better environment for 
mosquitos to breed than deeper, or moving water. Depth readings at Village Lake 
show varying water depths, from inches to several feet. Fowler said, even if a 
lake were full, mosquitos breed in the shallow water at the edges of the lake. 
He indicated that, with any standing water, low water or not, use of a 
larvacide is recommended for mosquito control.</p> 
<p>As for the loss of valuable tourist dollars due to a low water level in 
Village Lake, we are comforted by the fact there are several, albeit lesser, 
tourist attractions in the area.</p> 
<p><b>Medical subsidy</b></p> 
<p>Dear Editor:</p> 
<p>Whatever happened to common sense in Pagosa and Durango? I read with dismay 
about a girl who almost died from snake bites because adequate medical services 
are unavailable short of New Mexico.</p> 
<p>In Durango, they are firing doctors while patients are going begging for 
medical services.</p> 
<p>Judging from the letters in The SUN it is obvious that the doctors and 
medical providers in Pagosa are unhappy. Without these people, we have no local 
medical facilities.</p> 
<p>So, why don't we get a plan from these people and then execute it? My guess 
is the medical providers feel they are overworked and underpaid. An overworked 
doctor is no bargain.</p> 
<p>Doctors need time to keep up with the advances in medicine. And they are 
probably making a lot less than a third string tackle for the Broncos.</p> 
<p>So, if we need to subsidize the local medical facilities, so be it. Our 
county commissioners are more than willing to tax everything and everybody to 
subsidize about everything else.</p> 
<p>Sincerely,</p> 
<p>Bob Dungan</p>

<p><b>Country club docs</b></p> 
<p>Dear Editor:</p> 
<p>I was interested by the recent comments of certain people calling the 
physicians at Pagosa Family Medicine greedy country club doctors (Pagosa SUN 
July 31).</p> 
<p>If greedy country club doctors come into the office at 6 a.m. and often 
leave as late as 7 p.m. to 9 p.m., then obviously Drs. Pruitt and Piccaro are 
greedy country club doctors.</p> 
<p>If greedy country club doctors call patients who are in serious distress 
every hour on the hour late into the evening, then Pruitt and Piccaro are 
greedy country club doctors.</p> 
<p>If greedy country club doctors' livelihoods are dependent on how hard they 
work and are not subsidized by county taxes, then it is obvious that the 
above-mentioned physicians are greedy country club doctors. If there is a 
country club in Pagosa, I sure don't want to belong.</p> 
<p>As a lifelong testament to modern medicine, I have spent too much of my 
life going to physicians who specialized in only one part of the body or 
another. It wasn't until my husband and I moved to Pagosa that I had one 
physician who coordinated everything: Jim Pruitt, board certified family 
practice physician.</p> 
<p>He is a remarkable doctor who never ceases to astound his patients with his 
knowledge and caring.</p> 
<p>John Piccaro, also a board certified family practice physician, has proved 
himself to be an outstanding and deeply caring professional.</p> 
<p>So why would some people who have never been physicians tell lies about 
these two fine men? Why would people who have never seen these men in their 
professional capacity tell lies about them?</p> 
<p>Obviously the answer is to tarnish their professional and personal 
reputations. Perhaps Drs. Pruitt and Piccaro might want to check with an 
attorney about bringing civil suit for slander against these people.</p> 
<p>My! My! What would they say at the country club?</p>

<p><b>'Gray water'</b></p> 
<p>Dear Editor,</p> 
<p>At a recent PAWS meeting, Gene Tautges (assistant general manager) made a 
presentation to the board of directors detailing use of &quot;gray water&quot; 
for irrigation purposes. The idea was to upgrade our existing treatment plant 
in order to reuse our wastewater.</p> 
<p>This involves the reprocessing of wastewater to meet the newest state 
standards allowing it to be used as irrigation water. Many cities in the U.S. 
have been using this process for years as a means to conserve water.</p> 
<p>Using &quot;gray water&quot; is cheaper than pumping water for irrigation 
use from the San Juan River. Yet, after the presentation was made and 
discussions were held, the board chose not to go forward with the proposal at 
this time. We are in the second year of drought and needing to conserve every 
drop of water possible. Did the board miss another &quot;golden 
opportunity&quot; to be proactive in planning for the near future?</p> 
<p>John Hoehn</p> 
<p>Editor's note: According to Carrie Campbell, district general manager, the 
PAWS board determined there were not funds available in this year's budget to 
proceed with the project. The board intends to consider the idea in discussions 
concerning next year's budget.</p> 
<p><b>GI's return</b></p> 
<p>Dear Editor:</p> 
<p>As many Pagosa fighting men return home from war in Iraq, I believe it is 
time to reflect upon their incredible accomplishments and the work they have 
done and the change they have enabled for this nation and others.</p> 
<p>Though only a little more than half over, this has already been an historic 
year - a year marked by great progress in our global war on terror. Al Qaeda is 
weaker, still a threat, but decidedly weaker. Afghanistan is free. And Saddam 
Hussein no longer rules Iraq, thanks in large part to America's war-fighting 
teams. Now, those who commit terrorist acts or sponsor them know full well the 
United States will hunt them down and bring them to justice.</p> 
<p>Cpl. Chuck Kelley, USMC, now one of Pagosa's youthful fighting veterans, 
set a course for Kuwait before Thanksgiving 2002. Setting sail as part of a 
very daring U.S. Navy/Marine Corps team with a cutlass in his teeth, ready to 
do his nation's bidding on arrival. After crossing the Kuwait border and 
fighting his way to Baghdad and on to Karbala, he was proud to wear the 
&quot;cloth&quot; of his country as he battled terror across Iraq.</p> 
<p>The stories of bravery and grace under fire are still coming in, and they 
only serve to prove that this generation of our country's finest are every bit 
as dedicated to the ideals for which this country stands as those who stared 
down Hitler, who took the war to Japan and who helped win the Civil War.</p> 
<p>Yet, even as I marvel at young Cpl. Kelley's humility and boldness, I 
marveled, too, at the realization that many in our military share those same 
qualities. They are out there standing watch for freedom right now, quietly, 
purposefully - and they are all heroes. Sometimes, just those thoughts make it 
hard to swallow the lump in one's throat.</p> 
<p>I'm certain all Pagosans share my deep pride in each of them. So, when you 
meet one of these Patriots, please give them a handshake or a pat on the back 
and tell them know how you feel. I think you'll be surprised at the lumps you 
put in their throats.</p> 
<p>Welcome home Chuck; Well Done, Marine!</p>

<p><b>Blessing denied</b></p> 
<p>Dear Editor:</p> 
<p>On the complaint of three members (out of 800 or so), the management of the 
Archuleta County Senior Center has informed the membership that, henceforth, 
they cannot ask the blessing of the Lord before luncheon.</p> 
<p>To partake of a meal without thanking God runs against the beliefs and 
practice of the great majority of the members who have been doing this for over 
40 years.</p> 
<p>It is about time that the minority rein in their self righteousness for the 
general good, and not create controversy in an otherwise tranquil and congenial 
setting.</p> 
<p>After all, the seniors' group also pledges allegiance to the flag each 
Friday, which also has reference to the Almighty. So what may we expect from 
these few?</p> 
<p>While I still can, I say God bless the senior center; God bless America.</p>

<p><b>Shame on you</b></p> 
<p>Dear Editor:</p> 
<p>My husband and I attended the meeting July 15 of the board of directors of 
the Health District at which we were stunned by their vote against 
privatization of the physicians at the Dr. Mary Fisher Clinic.</p> 
<p>They had previously seemed to favor the proposal which had been offered by 
Dr. Mark Wienpahl, Dr. Jim Pruitt, Dr. Bob Brown, Nurse Practitioner Susan 
Kuhns and J.R. Ford. But, quite suddenly, with very little public discussion, 
the vote was 5-2 in favor of letting the board restructure the Mary Fisher 
Clinic and run it with staff hired from all over the place.</p> 
<p>Those five board members have made a tragic mistake affecting the lives and 
peace of mind of so many of us, not to mention the medical professionals we 
have all depended upon for so many years.</p> 
<p>As we left that awful meeting, I saw people crying. None of the five board 
members were crying, but EMTs in full uniform and former nurses of the clinic 
who know us all so well could not hide their sadness at what transpired that 
night.</p> 
<p>Shame on you five directors.</p>

<p><b>Reconsider vote</b></p> 
<p>Dear Editor:</p> 
<p>I have been following the health services crisis and have attended a few of 
the board meetings and special meetings. I feel that the decision not to 
embrace the six-point plan and the proposal by Dr. Wienpahl and J.R. Ford was 
based on unsound financial advice, and I urge those who voted against it to do 
some careful research and reconsider your vote.</p> 
<p>The concerns of the local physicians cannot be ignored. Medical input is 
needed in all district decisions, and we need to integrate health care in the 
community - not compete one against another.</p> 
<p>There is also a need to subsidize indigent care (as we do now), and the 
burden of that care should not rest on one private or public clinic. 
Twenty-four hour care is vital to this community. Both of these concerns were 
addressed and planned for under the proposal.</p> 
<p>The board of directors is under increased scrutiny by the community. Now is 
the time to rise to the occasion and act responsibly to solve the current 
problems.</p>

<p>The Office of Consumer Counsel released a chart comparing state-to-state

charged by some companies.</p> 
<p>The OCC cautions that these rates and the various additional fees are 
subject to change and consumers should call to confirm the rates before signing 
up with a particular company and plan. Also, the rate comparison does not 
include all companies, or are all calling plans of the companies included in 
the chart. The OCC also warns that some companies charge additional fees, that 
mean higher long-distance rates. Also, consumers should avoid the major 
companies' &quot;basic rates.&quot;</p>

Hints, and additional consumer information in OCC Consumer News, call, write or

<p><b>End of no-fault insurance</b></p> 
<p>The no-fault auto provisions will not be reviewed whenever policyholders 
hit their next renewal date. The no-fault provisions remain in effect until the 
current policy ends, or until the consumer opts to cancel the old policy and 
get a new tort version. So we are likely to see many no-fault policies over at 
least the next six months.</p> 
<p>If the consumer doesn't pay for extra medical coverage - an option under 
the new auto policies - and that consumer is at fault in an auto accident, 
their Medicare will pay primary on their medical bills per normal Medicare 
coverage rules.</p> 
<p>If the consumer opts to pay for extra medical coverage, then that medical 
coverage will be primary for injuries in an auto accident caused by that 
consumer.</p> 
<p>If the consumer is in an auto accident that is the fault of another driver, 
then that at-fault driver's auto liability coverage is the primary payer. 
Medicare will want at-fault driver's liability insurance to pay the bills.</p> 
<p>If there is slow payment or a dispute about who is at fault, and payment of 
the health bills is not likely to happen for more that 120 days; the Medicare 
manual says Medicare will make a conditional payment, but it will want the 
Medicare money back if an auto insurer eventually makes a medical payment.</p>

<p><b>Veterans need to update VA health information</b></p> 
<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p> 
<p><b>By Andy Fautheree</b></p> 
<p><b>SUN Columnist</b></p> 
<p>Many veterans have been coming forth in the past few weeks to report their 
financial information for the VA health care system.</p> 
<p><b>Update is important</b> </p> 
<p>As I have reported here lately, I urge all Archuleta County veterans to 
update their VA health care information.</p> 
<p>As of Jan. 17, 2003, all veterans enrolled in VA health care in Priority 
Category 7 and 8 are required to provide this information.</p> 
<p>Typically, it is due on the veteran's anniversary of enrollment in VA 
health care. If you're unsure, best bet is to stop by the office and I will 
help you fill out the form.</p> 
<p>Veterans with a compensable service-connected disability of 10 percent or 
more are not required to provide financial information. However, most of our 
local veterans do not have service-connected disabilities, and must complete 
the form.</p> 
<p><b>Catch 22</b></p> 
<p>Frequently I find the veteran has not updated this information for several 
years, and was never asked to by the VA. However, in the eyes of the VA, this 
is not an acceptable reason for not complying with this requirement. The old 
&quot;Catch-22&quot; problem.</p> 
<p>I have the original applications on hand for many of our veterans here in 
the office. Many of them are stored on my computer system. It only takes a few 
minutes to update the information and I will fax it to the VA Medical Center in 
Albuquerque.</p> 
<p><b>Could be dropped</b> </p> 
<p>Failure to provide this information could make the veteran ineligible for 
VA health care appointments until the information is provided. In the most 
extreme cases, a veteran might be dropped from active VA health care patient 
status and have to re-enroll.</p> 
<p>It wouldn't pay to be dropped from the VA health care system under the 
current guidelines. Some veterans may not qualify to re-enter.</p> 
<p>Prior to Jan. 17, veterans did not have to provide their financial 
information and could still get in. But, after that date, all veterans without 
service-connected disabilities and with certain higher incomes may not be 
eligible to enroll.</p> 
<p>Those enrolled before Jan. 17 are grandfathered in the system, and can 
remain in VA health care, even though they have higher incomes. But, they still 
have to provide a financial Means Test to continue to receive VA health care 
benefits.</p> 
<p><b>Fair success</b></p> 
<p>I met many of our local veterans at the Archuleta County Fair last week. 
</p> 
<p>Quite a few of you stopped by my Veterans Service Office booth. It was nice 
to see old friends and meet new veterans there.</p> 
<p>I had my laptop computer and printer on hand and was able to help quite a 
few veterans fill out the forms for their VA health care, right on the spot.</p>
<p>For information on these and other veterans benefits please call or stop by 
the Veterans Service Office located on the lower floor of the Archuleta County 
Courthouse. The office number is 264-2304, the fax number is 264-5949, and 
e-mail is afautheree@ archuletacounty.org. The office is open from 8 to 4, 
Monday through Thursday, Friday by appointment. Bring your DD Form 214 
(Discharge) for registration with the county, application for VA programs, and 
for filing in the VSO office.</p>

<p><b>Welcome Rocky Mountain Championship Cutting Horse participants to Pagosa 
Springs</b> </p> 
<p><b>By Sally Hameister</b></p> 
<p>We hope you will join us at the fairgrounds tonight to welcome our cutting 
horse event guests and to enjoy a delicious dinner and music.</p>

Championship Cutting Horse Event is being held at the Galles Ranch sponsored by 
Galles and UBS Aug. 6-14, and tonight was designated as the night for all of 
Pagosa to come out and meet these folks, welcome them to our fine community and 
benefit Habitat for Humanity all at the same time.</p> 
<p>These folks will be eating, sleeping, shopping and recreating in Pagosa 
throughout their stay, so we want to make them feel as welcome as the flowers 
in May.</p> 
<p>Join us at 6 p.m. at the fairgrounds for great food and entertainment. You 
can buy tickets at the door or stop at the Chamber anytime before 5 p.m.

registration fee includes lunch.</p> 
<p>To register or for more information, call Kathi DeClark at 946-2057.</p> 
<p><b>Habitat benefit canceled</b></p> 
<p>Due to extenuating circumstances, Habitat for Humanity of Archuleta County 
has decided to postpone the benefit dinner/dance planned for Aug. 16 at Hart's 
Rocky Mountain Retreat.</p> 
<p>I'm sure one of the reasons for the postponement was that everyone looked 
at their calendars for August and decided we probably couldn't sustain another 
event.</p> 
<p>The great thing about this is that they will probably reschedule for 
sometime after the first of the year when we all will be looking for something 
fun and exciting to do. Stay tuned to this column to learn about the new date.
</p> 
<p><b>Outreach Council benefit</b></p> 
<p>The Pagosa Outreach Council (Episcopal, Methodist and Catholic Churches) is 
sponsoring an afternoon of fun and games (literally) to raise funds for those 
in our community who could use a little help.</p> 
<p>You are invited to come to the PLPOA Clubhouse located on Port Avenue 1-5 
p.m. Friday to enjoy bridge, pinochle and/or Maj Jong with the foursome of your 
choosing, if you like, or just to play with new partners.</p>

Catholic and Methodist Churches for $10 which also includes refreshments.</p> 
<p>For details, please call Mary at 731-5121 or Patti at 731-5213.</p> 
<p><b>Thanks, Sheila</b></p> 
<p>The Chamber wishes to extend a special &quot;thank you&quot; to Sheila 
Hunkin for her help recently stuffing 750 discount coupon packets for us to 
pass out to all the Galles cutting horse participants.</p> 
<p>Unless you have done such a thing, you have no idea what a backbreaking 
task that can be. Basically, imagine walking around a table 750 times and 
picking up 35 items each time. Poor Doug had a sore back for a few days after 
that last stuffing. Thanks, Sheila - don't know what we would do without you.

<p><b>Exercise for arthritis</b></p> 
<p>The Tufts University Health and Nutrition Letter for August has a 
definitive article on several safe but significant strength training exercises 
to do at home that have reduced pain up to 43 percent. It is especially helpful 
for people with knee or hip arthritis. These look very good but, as always, 
check with your doctor. Copies may be made of these exercises. </p> 
<p>Another Tufts article covers the proper precautions before traveling 
abroad. It states that what you eat and mosquitoes are more likely risks than 
terrorism.</p> 
<p>Carry antimalarial pills if going to Africa, Central and South America. Get 
hepatitis A shots for practically any destination. Even knowing to wash your 
hands before and after peeling fruit would help cut down on common infections. 
The International Association for Medical Assistance to Travelers (IAMAT) 
offers a directory of English-speaking physicians in various countries. There 
is an e-mail address and phone number in the report. Other tips are in the 
report. Copies may be made.</p> 
<p>One last Tufts tip: &quot;There's no harm in drinking ice-cold water when 
you exercise. Cold fluids empty from the stomach faster than warm ones so 
they're faster at replacing water lost through sweating. That can have an 
immediate effect of cooling off the body's core.&quot; This according to 
William Evans, a nutrition expert.</p>

<p><b>Walk Back in Time</b> </p> 
<p><b>A trek into Pagosa history</b></p> 
<p><b>By Tess Noel Baker</b></p> 
<p><b>Staff Writer</b></p> 
<p>&quot;I came around the corner and suddenly I wasn't taking a walk in the 
woods. I walked around the corner and I was just charmed.&quot;</p> 
<p>That's how Pagosa Ranger District Interpreter Phyllis Decker described her 
first glimpse of the Murray ranch as she was researching A Walk Back in Time, 
an interpretive program sponsored by the U.S. Forest Service.</p> 
<p>The ranch was the piece de resistance of the walk, the final trophy for 
participants. Come around a bend on a rough forest road and suddenly the trees 
part to reveal an open meadow above the river. A log house, untouched since the 
1940s, stands gray and weather-beaten on top of a small hill. Wooden fences 
separate holding areas for cattle. The remains of some outbuildings lie among 
the prairie grasses. The scene almost begs passersby to stop, look and imagine 
the people who lived here once upon a time. But they're the end of the story.
</p> 
<p>This walk back in time actually began at the site of a 1930s Civilian 
Conservation Corps camp located at the end of the Blanco River Road 
approximately 11 miles south of Pagosa Springs on U.S. 84. Participants left 
their vehicles at what is now a picnic ground and set off on foot for a 
three-mile, round-trip walk.</p> 
<p>Along the way, Decker took the six travelers back through Pagosa's logging 
and ranching eras with a few detours even farther back.</p> 
<p>The first stop came soon after the group passed through the gate blocking 
motorized travel.</p> 
<p>From there, they could look down on the banks of the river where several 
buildings once stood housing The Civilian Conservation Corps camp. The CCC was 
one of many &quot;New Deal&quot; programs started by the federal government to 
help pull the country out of the Great Depression in the 1930s. The goal was to 
put people back to work.</p> 
<p>In the early days, Decker said, participants in the corps were paid $30 a 
month. Twenty-five dollars was immediately sent home to family. Participants in 
the program served six months to two-year terms in more than 4,000 such camps 
throughout the country. In Archuleta County, the camp operated for about five 
years beginning in 1933.</p> 
<p>&quot;I can't find anything that mentions it after 1937,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>The main camp buildings were constructed on pine slats with the bark still 
attached. Barracks were tents, and the officers' quarters were actually located 
across the river from the other camp buildings.</p> 
<p>Apparently, participants stayed at the base camp, but went to smaller, 
satellite camps throughout the area to work. Projects included: erosion 
prevention, road building, fire prevention, fire fighting and trail building. 
Decker said it's likely members of the corps even built the original forest 
service building at 2nd and Pagosa streets and several of the area forest 
service fire lookouts.</p> 
<p>Forest Service Archaeologist Gary Fairchild said he believes the CCC 
workers constructed two footbridges along the Piedra River trail which still 
span the river today. One was built in 1934. The other in 1936. Currently, he 
is looking into the possibility of attaching a historical status to both.</p> 
<p>&quot;I think they ought to be listed on the historical register because 
the architecture is so incredible,&quot; he said.</p> 
<p>The educational level of those involved in the CCC spanned a wide spectrum, 
Decker said. Some were illiterate. Others had college degrees. Most probably 
fell somewhere in the middle.</p> 
<p>As the modern day hikers took off from the camp for the rest of their walk, 
Decker pointed out a point where the forest changed - where larger, older 
ponderosas towered above the forest floor. Loggers had apparently left some of 
the area untouched. In general, she said, the logging companies could only 
reach about three miles away from the railroad. Otherwise, it was too difficult 
to transport the downed timber.</p> 
<p>The trees that are left tell their own story if the signs are read, 
Fairchild said.</p> 
<p>Come across a tree with a three-sided square scarred into the trunk at 
about chest level and it could be a sign of &quot;cultural modification.&quot;
</p> 
<p>The scarred squares are indicative of sites where Native Americans once 
harvested the cambium in the trees for use as a cooking condiment.</p> 
<p>Other markings can be found in stands of aspen in some areas of the county, 
Fairchild said. The white bark was a favorite canvas for the Hispanic 
sheepherders traveling through the area starting in the 1600s. Carvings can 
range from initials and names to figures - usually of women. A grant from the 
Colorado Historical Society allows archaeologists to spend time recording the 
carvings for preservation.</p> 
<p>After these detours, the hikers took a short walk down to a former sawmill, 
paused for pictures of a butterfly and then rounded the bend to the Murray 
Ranch for the end of the story.</p> 
<p>Decker said her research shows the first 160 acres of the ranch was 
homesteaded by John Benson in 1903. Over the next 60 years or so it was used 
for a variety of purposes, including: logging, cattle, subsistence, sheep and 
limited farming.</p> 
<p>The story revolves around a famous squatter and horse trader as well as a 
man who built a house, married a woman with nine children and lost the house to 
a flood all in the same year.</p> 
<p>It's fascinating &#138; and best told in the shadow of the rotting 
buildings with camera and imagination close at hand.</p> 
<p>Decker said the next Walk Back in Time is set for Aug. 30 at 9 a.m. Anyone 
interested should meet at the picnic ground located 2.5 miles in on the Blanco 
River Road. The program is free and open to the public.</p> 
<p>Interpretive programs like the Walk Back in Time are being offered 
throughout the summer at various locations across Pagosa Country. For an 
updated calendar, check Kate's Calendar in this week's PREVIEW or call the 
Forest Service at 264-2268. </p>

<p><b>The Old Spanish Trail &#138;a link to county history</b></p> 
<p><b>By John M. Motter</b></p> 
<p><b>PREVIEW Columnist</b></p> 
<p>Long before Horace Greeley proclaimed &quot;Go West, young man!,&quot; 
before the Oregon Trail or the 1849 rush to Sutter's Mill in California, even 
before the Santa Fe Trail, there was the Old Spanish Trail.</p> 
<p>The great thing about the Old Spanish Trail as far as I am concerned, is at 
least one branch led through today's Archuleta County.</p> 
<p>Folks who have lived around a bit know there are a plethora of old Spanish 
trails with a variety of names. Californians like to talk about El Camino Real, 
the King's Highway. Texas has two or three old Spanish trails including the 
Nacogdoches to San Antonio Trace and others.</p> 
<p>For at least a couple of centuries, New Mexico's only connection with the 
outside world was a tortuous journey from Santa Fe to Durango, Mexico, a 
portion of which was known as El Jornada del Muerte, the Journey of Death. The 
Journey of Death was a stretch of the road approximately between Socorro and El 
Paso where the Apaches elevated the art of looting wagon trains to a high 
science.</p> 
<p>I like to think the Old Spanish Trail which ran through Archuleta County 
was THE Old Spanish Trail. The Trail connected Spanish New Mexico with Spanish 
California. Of course there were several choices of routes. We'll talk about 
those choices before we're through.</p> 
<p>First, let's take a peak at the old road through the eyes of major 
chroniclers, the historians Leroy and Ann Hafen in their book, &quot;The Old 
Spanish Trail from Santa Fe to New Orleans.&quot;</p> 
<p>&quot;The Old Spanish Trail was the crookedest, most arduous pack mule 
route in the history of America,&quot; they wrote.</p> 
<p>&quot;Envisioned and launched in the late 1700s to serve as a connecting 
link between two of Spain's colonial outposts, the Trail reached its 
short-lived heyday in the 1830s and '40s, when annual caravans packed woolen 
blankets from New Mexico to trade for California horses and mules.&quot;</p> 
<p>At the ends of the route were two old pueblos, the Hafens say, Villa Real 
de Santa F&eacute; de San Francisco (Royal Town of the Holy Faith of Saint 
Francis) and El Pueblo de Nuestra Se&ntilde;ora La Reina de Los Angeles (Town 
of Our Lady the Queen of the Angels. Santa F&eacute; was 171 years old when Los 
Angeles was founded.</p> 
<p>The Hafens borrow from another historian, George F. Ruxton, for a 
description of a mule team.</p> 
<p>Ruxton wrote: &quot;Muleteering is the natural occupation of the Mexican. 
He is in all his glory when he is traveling as one of the mozos of a large 
atajo - a caravan of pack mules; but the height of his ambition is to attain 
the rank of mayordomo or capit&aacute;n - the brigadero of Castille. The 
atajos, numbering from fifty to two hundred mules, travel a daily distance - 
jornada - of twelve or fifteen miles, each mule carrying a pack weighing from 
two hundred to four hundred pounds. To a large atajo eight or ten muleteers are 
attached, and the dexterity and quickness with which they will saddle and pack 
an atajo of one hundred mules is surprising. The animals being driven to the 
spot, the lasso whirls around the head of the muleteer and falls over the head 
of a particular mule. The tapojos is placed over the eyes, the heavy aparejo 
adjusted, and the pack secured, in three minutes. On reaching the place where 
they propose to encamp, the packsaddles are all ranged in regular order, with 
the packs between, and covered with petates, a trench being cut around them in 
wet weather to carry off the rain. One mule is always packed with a metate - 
the stone block upon which maize is ground to make tortillas, and the office of 
the cook is undertaken in order by each of the muleteers. Frijoles and chile 
colorado comprise their daily bill of fare.&quot;</p> 
<p>Another first person account of the trade between New Mexico and California 
was written by a Frenchman, Duflot der Mofras in 1841: &quot;Caravans travel 
once a year from New Mexico to Los Angeles. These consist of 200 men on 
horseback, accompanied by mules laden with fabrics and large woolen covers 
called serapes, jerzas, and cobertones, which are valued at 3 to 5 piasters 
each. This merchandise is exchanged for horses and mules, on a basis, usually, 
of two blankets for one animal. Caravans leave Santa Fe, New Mexico, in October 
before the snow sets in, travel west &#138; and finally reach the outlying 
ranchos of California from where the trail leads in to El Pueblo de los 
Angeles. This trip consumes two and one-half months. Returning caravans leave 
California in April in order to cross the rivers before the snow melts, taking 
with them about 2,000 horses.</p> 
<p>&quot;The expedition that reached El Pueblo in November, 1841, included in 
addition to some 200 Mexicans, 60 or more North Americans.&quot;</p> 
<p>American fur trappers used the Old Spanish Trail starting with the 1820s, 
as did a number of California settlers.</p> 
<p>In general, the Old Spanish Trail contained an eastern and a western 
branch. The eastern route loosely followed the Rio Grande River into the San 
Luis Valley, crossed Cochetopa Pass northwest of Saguache, and rejoined the 
western route in western Colorado or eastern Utah.</p> 
<p>The western route generally followed the Rio Grande and Chama rivers to 
Abiquiu, the jumping off point. Between Abiquiu and the Dolores River near 
Dolores, several optional routes were used. The Dominguez-Escalante Party in 
1776 generally followed the Chama River north to El Vado, cut across the 
Jicarilla Apache Reservation to Carracas, then turned westerly until reaching 
the Dolores.</p> 
<p>An alternate route involved turning west just north of Abiquiu and crossing 
the Continental Divide to pick up Ca&ntilde;on Largo. Ca&ntilde;on Largo 
reaches the San Juan River near Blanco, New Mexico. From that point the trail 
again pointed to the Dolores River.</p> 
<p>A third route followed by Army Capt. Macomb in 1859 crossed Archuleta 
County by first going to Pagosa Springs, then turning west and going to the 
Dolores River.</p> 
<p>In any case, decades before settlement came to Pagosa Country, Indians, 
Hispanics, trappers, and other adventurers rode horseback through the virgin 
countryside. I wish I had been one of them.</p>

<p> </p> <b>Editorial</b> 
<p></p> 
<p><b>Control growth, needs</b></p> 
<p>It's the proverbial good news, bad news. An article in a metropolitan daily 
last week revealed the county will grow 3.8 percent 2000-2005 compared to 1.6 
percent statewide, the second highest projected growth rate in the state. This 
is good news to all of us who secure a living by profiting from the arrival of 
newcomers. It is bad news to those of us who cast a critical eye on the 
problems faced by county residents.</p> 
<p>Growth is positive when one considers how important its attendant 
industries are to our local economy. This fact has never been lost on the 
residents of the area. A note in Shari Pierce's column taken from the newspaper 
90 years ago shows Pagosa was expected to grow to 3,000 to 5,000 in population 
with the arrival of the railroad. Growth was expected to be accompanied by the 
&quot;improvements and business opportunities that will attract and hold a 
large population.&quot;</p> 
<p>That growth never materialized 90 years ago, and Pagosa's population fell 
far short of that goal. But, recently, spurred by an influx of people leaving 
their former homes, lured by the beauty of the area and by the growth of the 
tourism-based economy, the county has finally satisfied the prediction</p> 
<p>Real estate, construction, building materials, home furnishings, the 
industries that furnish the necessary stuff of everyday life - groceries, gas, 
and the like - all flourish as growth continues. We have been able to 
&quot;attract and hold a large population.&quot; We all reap the rewards.</p> 
<p>On the other side of the issue, however, is the fact that the problems so 
prominent in our news stem from growth and from our inability to keep up with 
the demands that accompany it.</p> 
<p>Entities that provide essential services such as medical and emergency 
medical care, road maintenance, water, education, are always behind, sometimes 
painfully so, in the race to keep up with increased workloads, elevated 
expectations. In some cases, our expanding needs have pulled entities forward 
at too great a speed, exceeding the capacity of staff and budgets to make the 
necessary adjustments. In other cases, there is simply not enough money to keep 
pace, no matter how enlightened the leadership. </p> 
<p>Options are available and we must remind ourselves to keep them in mind, 
put them into practice. Two are public, another personal.</p> 
<p>First, we can find ways to fund implementation of programs to meet our 
reasonable demands. A use tax proposal to be put before the voters in November 
by the county is, perhaps with some modification, a good example. If passed, 
the funds will be used to supplement a county road budget that is never enough 
to satisfy a fussy public. As long as growth continues, and as long as we 
persist in constructing homes in a market already flooded with available 
dwellings, revenues produced by the taxation of materials purchased outside the 
community can be put to good use.</p> 
<p>Second is implementation of zoning - a traditional means of controlling and 
shaping growth and its impacts. While it is an effort that is late (it should 
have happened 90 years ago) there is still benefit to be gained.</p> 
<p>On the personal side, let's temper our expectations. Too many people flee 
here, bringing their problems and their needs. They expect the move to solve 
the problems; they anticipate their needs will be met. In truth, this is a 
rural mountain community; it cannot - it should not - provide services and 
amenities to equal those in the urban environment. We have to learn to live 
with this, or leave.</p> 
<p>We should not stifle growth; we must learn to control it and benefit from 
it. And work constantly to craft expectations in light of a desire to maintain 
Pagosa Country as the place whose rural charms drew us here in the first place.

<p><b>Who qualifies for Arlington?</b></p> 
<p><b>By Richard Walter</b></p> 
<p>Entombment of the late comedian Bob Hope in Arlington National Cemetery 
would not be unusual.</p> 
<p>Sen. Ben Nighthorse Campbell of Ignacio has proposed making an Arlington 
site available to the Hope family for the burial of &quot;a true American hero, 
a man who entertained troops in war zones without concern for his own 
well-being.&quot;</p> 
<p>First, what is Arlington?</p> 
<p>It is already the final resting place for more than 260,000 persons, with 
an average of 20 funerals per day conducted every weekday. It lies on a 
200-acre site surrounding Arlington House, the Robert E. Lee mansion, which was 
designated a military cemetery in 1864.</p> 
<p>Veterans from all the nation's wars, from the Revolution through the 
Persian Gulf War and Somalia are buried there. Pre-Civil War dead were 
reinterred after 1900.</p> 
<p>Arlington is second to Calverton National Cemetery on Long Island in number 
of burials and is home of The Tomb of the Unknowns, made from Yule marble 
quarried in Colorado. Currently, three unknown servicemen are buried there, one 
each from World War I, World War II and the Korean Conflict. A Vietnam unknown 
was disinterred in 1998 and identified. That crypt will remain empty.</p> 
<p>In addition to in-ground burial, Arlington has one of the larger 
columbariums for cremated remains in the country. Four courts with 5,000 niches 
each are in use and ongoing construction will allow for 100,000 remains.</p> 
<p>Hope would not be the first entertainer to be interred there.</p> 
<p>Actor Audie Murphy, a World War II Congressional Medal of Honor recipient, 
is interred there. Musician, bandleader and Army officer Glenn Miller is there, 
too.</p> 
<p>Among the women buried there are Fay Bainter, an actress from the era of 
silent films, and wife of Navy Lt. Cmdr. Reginald Venable. Also there is 
novelist Mary Roberts Rinehart, the first woman war correspondent, writing for 
Saturday Evening Post in World War II; Margarite Higgins, Pulitzer 
Prize-winning journalist, who was the only female correspondent during the 
Korean War; and Constance Bennett, an actress in more than 50 films, who was 
married to a brigadier general.</p> 
<p>Many prominent medical figures also are in Arlington, such as Anita Newcomb 
McGee, first woman army surgeon and founder of the Army Nurse Corps; pioneer 
bacteriologist Walter Reed; and Lt. Col. Albert Sabin, inventor of oral polio 
vaccine. </p> 
<p>Editors, publishers and news bureau chiefs also are buried there along with 
many novelists, including Samuel Dashiel Hammett who wrote &quot;The Maltese 
Falcon&quot; and &quot;The Thin Man&quot; and was jailed during the McCarthy 
era as a supposed communist threat.</p> 
<p>Officers with 5-star rank buried in Arlington are Adm. William D. Leahy, 
Gen. George C. Marshall, Gen. Henry H. Arnold, Gen. Omar N. Bradley and Adm. 
William F. Halsey.</p> 
<p>They are joined by one of only two 6-star officers in history, General of 
the Armies John J. &quot;Black Jack&quot; Pershing. The other 6-star recipent 
was General of the Armies, George Washington, buried at Mt. Vernon, Va.</p>

<p>Taken from Pagosa Springs New Era files of August 8, 1913</p> 
<p>Pagosa's hot springs knock rheumatism; the cold springs swat stomach 
trouble; the two combined cure many other ills. Pagosa has the world's premier 
curative waters and with a standard-gauge road direct across the range and 
accommodations to suit the rich as well as those of moderate means this town 
would easily become the nation's favorite mountain resort.</p> 
<p>Pagosa Springs will have a population of 3,000 to 5,000 within five years. 
We predict that because we believe that before five years has passed the town 
will be on a broad-gauge railroad and have improvements and business 
opportunities that will attract and hold and maintain a large population.</p>

<p>Taken from SUN files of August 10, 1928</p> 
<p>About thirty-five members and others were present at the Archuleta County 
Booster's Club banquet and meeting held at the Metropolitan Cafe Tuesday 
evening. A splendid feast was provided and followed by a business session, from 
which many community benefits will no doubt result.</p> 
<p>Sunday at the ranch home of Judge and Mrs. F.A. Byrne was a most enjoyable 
occasion. After church services a number of their friends gathered there with 
well-filled baskets. The dinner was spread on the tables beneath a beautiful 
grove of pines. All present did ample justice to the good things which had been 
prepared. There were about forty present, and late in the afternoon all 
departed hoping there might be more such occasions.</p> 
<p><b>50 years ago</b></p> 
<p>Taken from SUN files of August 7, 1953</p> 
<p>School will start August 31st, according to an announcement this week by 
A.D. Hahn, superintendent of schools. Junior and Senior high school 
registration will be August 27 and 28. All Junior high students must bring with 
them $2.00 book fee and all Senior high students must bring $3.00 ($2.00 book 
fee and $1.00 locker fee.)</p> 
<p>Work on the bridge improvement at McCabe Creek is continuing this week with 
the large tubes installed and the filling started. Work should be completed 
within a few days and will certainly make an improvement in that part of town. 
Work on the other bridges in town is now complete and when the McCabe Creek 
crossing is completed, the Town should be pretty well fixed for bridges for 
some time.</p>

<p>Taken from SUN files of August 10, 1978</p> 
<p>It was announced this week by Universal Telephone Co. that there would be a 
switch over of local system operations to new equipment installed this past 
year. The most noticeable change will changing the prefix from 968 to 264. This 
change is effective at 12 noon, Saturday, August 19. This change is being made 
because within two years the nationwide emergency number will be 911 and there 
will be no prefixes starting with number 9.</p> 
<p>The first Quilt Fair presented by San Juan Historical Society was very 
successful, with more than fifty quilts being shown. Probably the oldest was a 
&quot;Tulip Tree&quot; appliqued pattern with the date 1889 stitched on the 
back with the quilting stitches.</p>
