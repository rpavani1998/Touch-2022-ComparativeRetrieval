<p> <b><i>BAMBOO - The Gift of the Gods</i></b> Architect Oscar Hidalgo has 
dedicated his life to bamboo research, and teaching the world about the 
limitless possibilities of this remarkable plant. Born in a bamboo house in 
Chinchina, Colombia, bamboo construction was common in his state, where many 
residential and public buildings were constructed using this cheap and widely 
available material. Like most homes, in his house the bamboo was hidden beneath 
plaster, and indeed, it looked like it was made of brick. After he left the 
university, Oscar was intrigued by the possibilities of using bamboo in 
construction, and embarked on a project to construct a country club kiosk 23 
meters in diameter using this material. Five days before the opening ceremony, 
there was a hurricane which distorted the building extremely, moving the 
kingpost 90 cm off-center. After only two hours of working with a winch, 
however, the structure was successfully moved back into place without 
collapsing. He was sold on bamboo. Amazed at its structural integrity and 
aesthetic possibilities, he embarked on a program of research which has taken 
him to Asia, Costa Rica, Brazil, and elsewhere to study this plant and to 
create experimental structures. Hardcover: 553 pages Publisher: O.

<p> All About Bamboo</p>
<p></p> <i>The Bamboo Sourcery Information Supplement is a complete guide to 
the world of bamboo, providing thorough and accurate information and advice 
about such useful topics as bamboo care and cultivation, planting, selection of 
species, clumpers, runners, containment, flowering, pests, growing indoors, 
etc. Contents may be accessed through the menu at the left.</i> <br>

<p> <b>Introduction to Bamboo &amp; Bamboo Sourcery</b> </p>
<p> Bamboos are among the Earth's most beautiful and useful plants, providing 
outstanding texture and form as screens, hedges, ground-covers and specimens. 
They enhance and transform gardens into peaceful sanctuaries of light, movement 
and space, touching our spirits and stirring our souls. Bamboo can beguile and 
possess. So be forewarned, you may shortly find yourself becoming ensnared with 
bamboo magic!</p>
<p> Over 1000 species of bamboo in 90 genera have been described and named. 
The current rate of discovery suggests many more are still unknown. They come 
in a staggering variety of colors, sizes and shapes. Some creep along the 
ground only a few inches tall, others soar freestanding to over 100 feet. Some 
grow in tight clumps, others in open groves. Some even clamber up trees. The 
leaves of some species grow only half an inch long, while others reach a couple 
of feet. Many species have beautifully variegated culms (stems) and leaves.</p>
<p> The diversity of species is perhaps not too surprising when one considers 
the many environments in which they have evolved. Indigenous bamboos are widely 
found throughout Asia, Africa, Australia, and North and South America. They 
have evolved to fill a variety of ecological niches, ranging from tropical 
lowland to alpine highland, from rain forest to dry chaparral, and from acid to 
alkaline soils.</p>
<p> Bamboo Sourcery offers an extensive variety of bamboo plants in many 
sizes, ranging from the shippable 1 gal and 5 gal sizes to magnificent giant 
timber specimens 30 to 40 feet tall in large tubs. Our beautiful and unique 
demonstration gardens and expert advice enable you to select the best varieties 
for your needs. All stock is container-established and ready for planting. 
Special orders are welcome, and we deliver within the greater Bay Area. 
Delivery cost is based on distance. Removal services are offered on a 
case-by-case basis when staff time is available. We also carry bamboo root 
barriers, fertilizer, fencing, poles, garden accessories and books. Most of 
these items and many of our plants can be viewed in color photos on our website 
at bamboosourcery.com.</p>
<p> <b><i></i></b> </p>
<p> Our Bamboo Price List is always accessible on our website and is also 
available by mail upon request. Our Price List is updated frequently and

<p> Fascinating Facts about Bamboo</p>
<p></p>
<p> <b><i></i></b> </p>
<p> <b>Helps Reverse Global Warming: </b> Incredible and true, bamboo produces 
the MOST OXYGEN of all the plants! And it CONSUMES MORE CARBON DIOXIDE than any 
other plant!</p> 
<p> <b>Sustainably Harvested &amp; Annually Renewable: </b> Mature bamboos 
produce new shoots and canes each year, which can be harvested individually 
without destroying the plant.</p> 
<p> <b>Fastest Growing Plant on the Planet: </b> New shoots of some tropical 
species have been clocked growing up to 4 FEET PER DAY in their shooting season!
</p> 
<p> <b>Environmental Cleanup: </b> Bamboo plants are very effective at 
removing metals and other toxic substances from soils and water.</p> 
<p> <b>Diverse: </b> There are over 1500 SPECIES of bamboo in the world.</p> 
<p> <b>Stronger Than Steel: </b> Bamboo has a TENSILE STRENGTH of 28,000 per 
square inch, vs. 23,000 for steel.</p> 
<p> <b>Provides Safe Housing: </b> Over 1 billion people in the world live in 
BAMBOO HOUSES. Bamboo buildings have proven to be exceedingly earthquake proof.
</p> 
<p> <b>Nutrition for Humans and Animals: </b> BAMBOO SHOOTS have been eaten 
throughout Asia for centuries, and branches and leaves make good fodder for 
animals. It contains Germanium, which reverses the aging process in cells.</p> 
<p> <b>Ancient Healing: </b> Various parts of many bamboo species have been 
used in CHINESE AND AYURVEDIC MEDICINE for centuries.</p> 
<p> <b>Did You Know? </b> Thomas Edison used bamboo filaments in his first 
LIGHT BULBS, and one of those bulbs is STILL burning today at the Smithsonian 
in Washington, DC!</p> 
<p> <b>Hardy: </b> Bamboo was the first PLANT LIFE to return after the atomic 
bombings in Japan. Also, some bamboos are cold hardy to -20 degrees F.</p> 
<p> </p>
<p> How Bamboos Grow</p>
<p></p>
<p> <b><i></i></b> </p>
<p> Bamboos grow in fits and starts. For much of the year nothing much appears 
to be happening, and then in one brief season they explode with growth. In 
general, the first year or two after transplanting, you will not see tremendous 
above-ground growth, as the plant is putting most of its energy into its root 
system.</p> 
<p> During the summer and fall, most species manufacture and store sugars in 
their rhizomes. Rhizomes produce the roots, top growth, and new rhizomes. Then 
in spring and sometimes fall, they pump the accumulated energy into new shoots 
(culms), which achieve all of their height in about 30-60 days. The branches 
and leaves develop in another 30-60 days. Shoots of some species in mature 
groves in tropical climates have actually been clocked growing 4 feet in one 
24-hour period! As a young plant's rhizome system expands, its ability 
increases to produce larger, taller, and more numerous culms. Thus, each year's 
crop of shoots is larger than the last, until the mature size for the species 
is reached and new culms continue to come up at the mature size. This may take 
a number of years, depending on the size and age of the original planting, the 
species, and the growing conditions.</p> 
<p> Individual culms and rhizomes only live an average of 5-10 years, and the 
culms grow no taller or bigger with age. That is why the older parts of the 
plant are frequently the smallest. Old or dead culms can be thinned out to make 
more light available for new growth.</p> 
<p>  The shooting period varies from species to species and genus to genus. In 
general, the temperate climate bamboos are runners, which shoot in the spring, 
while the tropical and sub-tropical varieties are clumpers, which shoot in the 
late summer and fall.</p> 
<p> The size and appearance of any particular bamboo variety may vary 
significantly depending upon climate and conditions. Size alone is greatly 
affected by location, temperature, nutrition, water, and sun exposure.</p> <br>

<p> </p>
<p> Clumping and Running Bamboos</p>
<p></p>
<p> <b><i></i></b> There are two main types of bamboo: Noninvasive <i>clumping 
bamboos</i> (sympodial or pachymorph) have short roots and form discrete 
clumps. There are also a few species of clumpers which have slightly longer 
roots (6-18&quot;), and we refer to these as<i>open clumpers.</i> <i>Running 
bamboos</i> (monopodial or leptomorph) are the ones that spread through the 
growth of long, horizontal roots, called rhizomes. With a little knowledge and 
proper materials, running bamboos and open clumpers can be effectively 
contained. The information in this catalog will enable you to grow beautiful, 
well-behaved bamboo.</p>
<p> <b>Clumping bamboos</b> have a very short root structure, are genetically 
<i>incapable</i> of expanding more than few inches a year, and will generally 
form discrete circular clumps. The clumps slowly enlarge as new culms emerge 
every year, but may ultimately need to expand to anywhere from a 3 to 10 ft. 
diameter (or more, especially for taller types) in order to reach their mature 
height, depending on species. The dense root system can exert strong pressure 
on structures in contact with it, and thus clumpers should be planted at some 
distance from fences, sidewalks, retaining walls, etc. Clumpers make excellent 
specimen plants and will also form very dense screens, but more slowly than 
runners. Except for the Fargesias, clumpers tend to be less cold-hardy than 
runners.<br>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p> <b>Running bamboos</b> spread variously, sending out underground runners 
(rhizomes) which sometimes range far from the parent plant. Runners fill in the 
spaces between plantings faster, making them ideal for fast screens, hedges, 
and the popular open grove look. Bamboo runners may be easily contained, since 
the rhizomes grow sideways at a depth of only about 2-18 inches. Most are also 
very cold-hardy.</p>
<p> </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p> <b>RUNNERS VS CLUMPERS - CHOOSING THE BEST TYPE FOR YOUR NEEDS:</b> </p>
<p> We provide here some tips and criteria for choosing between runners and 
clumpers for a given purpose or planting location. These are very general 
guidelines and there can always be exceptions, depending on the situation.</p>
<p> <b>Runners are recommended for: </b> </p> 
<ul> 
<li>Fast privacy screens with quick fill-in, in narrower spaces than clumpers. 
</li> 
<li>Greatest height in the SF Bay Area &#150; some species grow up to 50 ft. 
In more tropical climates, some giant timbers may reach 60-70 ft.</li> 
<li>Large open groves. </li> 
<li>Ground covers and erosion control. </li> 
<li>Container planting. </li> 
<li>Less expensive plants (but may require root barrier installation). </li> 
<li>Greater variety of species to choose from. </li> </ul> <b>Runners are not 
recommended for: </b> 
<ul> 
<li>Situations where barrier installation is desirable but problematic (e.g. 
tree roots or on steep slopes)</li> 
<li>Where fear of invasiveness is insurmountable. </li> </ul> <b>Clumpers are 
recommended for: </b> 
<ul> 
<li>Dense screens (but slower to fill in). </li> 
<li>Height: Maximum SF Bay Area height is 40 ft. in some locations, but 30 ft. 
on average. Some of our giant timber clumpers may grow up to 55 ft. in tropical 
climates.</li> 
<li>Specimen plants and ornamental accents. </li> 
<li>Wherever spreading is undesirable, and root barrier installation is too 
expensive or difficult (e.g. tree roots or on steep slopes).</li> 
<li>Large, wide planting spaces or containers. Clumpers may require anywhere 
from a 3-10 ft. diameter circular space, or more, in order reach their mature 
height, depending on species.</li> </ul> <b>Clumpers are not recommended for</b>
 (again, these are very general guidelines and there can always be exceptions, 
depending on the situation):
<ul> 
<li>For fastest screens or fill-in. (They do gain height rapidly, however). 
</li> 
<li>Narrow planting beds or small or narrow containers, especially ceramic 
ones which can be broken by root pressure. Clumpers cannot easily adjust their 
circular shape to a long, narrow space, and height of culms may be limited if 
too small a space is allowed for the roots. Annual thinning can extend the 
length of time a clumper can grow in a small, contained space, however.</li> 
<li>Cold winter areas which receive lots of frost or temperatures below 20 
degrees F. (except the Fargesias, which are hardy to -20 degrees).</li> 
<li>For wide choice of species. There are fewer clumping species to choose 
from for any given micro climate or sun exposure, but there are some clumpers 
appropriate for almost every area. About 1/3 of the bamboo species are clumpers.
</li> </ul>

<p> <b>Please see </b>Containment of Bamboo for a complete explanation of 
methods of containment. And see ourPrice List for the many available clumping 
bamboos (designated by the code &quot;C&quot;), open clumpers (&quot;O&quot;), 
and running bamboos (&quot;R&quot;) that we offer.</p>

<p> Containment of Bamboo</p>
<p></p>
<p> <b><i></i></b> <b>Runners:</b> Runners should generally be contained if on 
a property line or in a small yard, even if bordered by surface structures such 
as brick or cement patio, cement sidewalk or driveway, or shallow walls.<i>The 
safest methods for containing running bamboos are:</i> </p>
<p> 1) Planting in containers Click the following link for details in a 
printable Microsoft Word document:Bamboo in Planters and Containers - Do's, 
Don'ts and Special Maintenance Considerations. </p>
<p> 2) Installing high-density polyethylene plastic rhizome barrier, 40-60 mil 
thick and 22-34 inches deep, vertically around the perimeter of the area in 
which the bamboo is to be contained. This material is thicker than a credit 
card and comes on a 300 ft. roll in different widths,24&quot; x 40 mil, 
30&quot; x 40 mil, 30&quot; x 60 mil, and 36&quot; x 60 mil. It can be cut to 
any length and installed in any shape desired. Even large plantings of bamboo 
can be surrounded with a single length of plastic, requiring only one seam. The 
polyethylene is superior to cement and metal (cement often develops cracks, and 
metal rusts and requires many seams), is less expensive, and can last 20-30 
years when installed according to ourbarrier installation instructions. We 
typically recommend using the 30&quot; barrier for most plants in the 
Phyllostachys genus.</p>
<p> Note: When planting <i>along a fenceline,</i> if there is sufficient space 
it is advisable to leave an 18-24 inch corridor between the fence and the 
bamboo barrier to allow a space for maintenance along the back side of the 
planting area. Also, when planting on<i>very steep slopes or planting very 
large giant timber runners in soft, sandy soil,</i> it may be necessary to use 
a 36&quot; deep root barrier.</p>
<p> <i>Less defined ways to contain runners are:</i> </p>
<p> 3) Water only the area in which the plants are wanted and nowhere else 
within 10 to 20 feet (in climates that have several dry months). Dry soils are 
a barrier to root growth. Spreading rhizomes require moisture and grow 
primarily during the warm summer months when most of the western states are 
dry. Cutting off new shoots coming up wherever they&#146;re not wanted 
complements and completes this method.</p>
<p> 4) A water-filled stream or ditch can also effectively contain the spread 
of bamboo, since rhizomes and roots cannot tolerate extended periods of 
saturation. Water need only be present for one season a year.</p>
<p> In some situations it is easiest to wait and see if there is going to be a 
problem before implementing containment measures. Many species require 3 years 
of growth before they begin to spread. Some running bamboos behave as clumpers 
under certain circumstances, such as lack of exposure to sun or very cold 
winter temperatures. On a large property where invasion of neighboring land or 
other parts of a garden are not issues, one may simply let the rhizomes go 
where they wish and remove new cane shoots by breaking them off if they emerge 
in any areas where canes are not desired. The tender shoots of larger species 
may also be harvested for food when just breaking ground. Since the rhizomes 
generally grow quite shallow, usually within the top 12 inches of soil, roots 
may also be curbed annually by cutting with a shovel and pulling them out while 
still young. The hazards of bamboo cultivation are often overstated.</p>
<p> <i>With a certain amount of muscle power and the necessary tools, removal 
of bamboo IS possible. We also occasionally remove unwanted bamboo free of 
charge upon request, if we have time and have a use for it. If further advice 
or clarification is needed, please call Bamboo Sourcery.</i> </p>
<p> <b>Clumpers </b> </p>
<p> With clumpers, it is not necessary or effective to surround the plant with 
a plastic root barrier. However, when selecting clumpers and planning the 
space, one must keep in mind that the root ball of a clumper must be allowed to 
reach a certain size in order to grow culms of a mature height. The circular 
space required may vary from 3 to 10 ft. in diameter, or more, depending on 
size of species. Clumpers cannot adjust their circular shape to a long, narrow 
space, and height of culms may be limited if too small a space is allowed for 
the roots.</p>
<p> In addition, clumpers may be shaped and prevented from putting pressure on 
any surrounding structures (such as a fence or sidewalk) by removing new shoots 
at soil level when they begin to encroach more closely on those structures. It 
is advisable to plant a clumping bamboo 2-4 ft. from a fence to allow some room 
for growth, top spread, and space for maintenance between the bamboo and the 
fence.</p>

<p> </p>
<p> Flowering of Bamboos</p>
<p></p>
<p> <b><i></i></b> </p>
<p> One of the mysteries of bamboo is how some species are able to flower 
periodically all over the world at the same time. This is called 
&#147;gregarious flowering.&#148; This was the case with Phyllostachys 
bambusoides when it flowered during the 1970's, as it has done every 120 years 
through recorded bamboo history. Being an important timber variety, records of 
its flowering go back many centuries. To our knowledge, no one knows what 
triggers the flowering. While the flowering of some bamboos is periodic, others 
seem to be triggered by environmental conditions such as drought or stress. We 
do not sell plants that we know to be going into &quot;gregarious 
flowering&quot; stage, however we also do not have records adequate to predict 
when most species will flower. Flowering of the individual plant may continue 
for 2 to 7 years and is often fatal, but with extra care and feeding, the 
mother plant may survive and just be smaller. In addition, the numerous seeds 
may be planted and will reproduce the mother plant identically or produce new 
and interesting variations. By the time the mother plant finishes flowering, 
you may already have new seedlings well on their way!</p> 
<p>Bamboos belong to the grass family, and their flowers look a lot like the 
flowers of other grasses, usually nothing spectacular, but quite varied. 
Traditionally, botanists describe species on the basis of their flowers. 
Because the flowering interval of some bamboo species is so long, botanists in 
the field often have difficulty finding flowers and defining species on that 
basis. This sometimes results in multiple names for the same plant and a great 
deal of confusion. Promising genetic research and international cooperation 
should help clarify the situation.</p> <br>

<p> </p> 
<p> </p>
<p> How and When to Plant</p>
<p></p>
<p> <b><i></i></b> There are no hard and fast rules about planting bamboo. But 
we offer the following guidelines:</p>
<p> Bamboos grow best in rich, moist, well-drained soils. Often the addition 
of compost or other additives is beneficial (see section below). Place the 
plant at approximately the same soil level as it is in the pot, in a hole 
somewhat larger than the pot. After filling in around the plant, pack the soil 
firmly to eliminate air bubbles and soak thoroughly. Through the first year, 
make sure the plant remains moist but not waterlogged. Do not fertilize for the 
first 6 months. Plants have been fertilized at the nursery, and additional 
fertilizer at this point could shock the plant.</p>
<p> The best time to plant varies from area to area and species to species. In 
<b>cold winter climates </b> the best planting time is in the spring when 
likelihood of frost is past and when the ground can be worked. Bamboos do not 
develop their full cold-hardiness until well established, and planting in 
spring gives the plant a longer growing season to get established and develop 
its cold-hardiness before the next cold season. If planting in the late summer, 
we recommend planting even the most cold-hardy bamboos at least 3 months before 
first frost (although planting season may be somewhat extended by using frost 
covers). Thick mulch is recommended to protect the plants over the first winter 
regardless of when planted.</p>
<p> In <b> very hot summer climates </b>, the best planting times for bamboos 
are early spring and late fall. Bamboos will more readily establish themselves 
when weather is milder and rain is more likely. Mid-summer planting can 
sometimes be accomplished by using shade cloth to protect from intense sun.</p>
<p> In <b> mild climate </b> areas such as coastal California, it doesn&#146;t 
make as much difference, except for the least cold hardy clumpers, for which 
spring is still the best. Here every season has its advantages, with spring and 
summer offering the most active growing periods and fall, winter and spring 
sharing the rainy season.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> Site and Soil Preparation</p>
<p></p>
<p> <b><i></i></b> Most bamboos grow best in deep, well-drained, fertile 
soils, and they generally prefer neutral to slightly acid soils. If your soil 
is deficient, the extra time and expense of improving it is usually well worth 
the effort.</p>
<p> <i>Sandy soils and alkaline soils</i> may be improved with the addition of 
organic materials such as compost, peat, manures, nitrolized sawdust, or bark 
chips. These materials help retain moisture, acidify the soil, and also provide 
nutrition to the plants. Acid fertilizers can also be added to compensate for 
extremely alkaline soils. For<i>overly acidic soils</i> with pH of 5.5 or 
lower, add lime to reduce acidity to a pH of 6.0 - 7.0.<i>Clay soils</i> may be 
improved to provide better drainage with the addition of sand and organic 
materials. Most bamboos suffer root damage if submerged in water for several 
weeks. Drainage may also be improved by mounding the soil or ditching around 
the planting. Bamboos can be grown well in very shallow soils if adequate 
fertility and moisture are maintained. It&#146;s always a good idea to consult 
with your local nurseryman about how best to amend your local soils. (Note: If 
you have gophers in your area, be sure to read the section onPests before 
planting).</p>
<p> </p>
<p> Potting Mixes</p>
<p></p>
<p> <b><i></i></b> If you plan to grow your bamboo in containers, make sure to 
use a good potting mix. Most commercial potting or nursery mixes are adequate 
as they are.</p>
<p> The soil you use should both drain well and retain moisture. Most mixes 
contain both organic and inorganic elements. Sand, volcanic cinders, and 
perlite are excellent stable inorganic components. Sand has the virtue of being 
cheap, while cinders and perlite not only promote good drainage but also hold 
water. Fir bark, compost, and peat are good organic components. In general, 
larger organic particles last longer before breaking down; therefore, drainage 
improves with larger particles, decreases with smaller ones. It may also be 
advantageous to add a small proportion of loam or clay for micro-nutrients. In 
a potting mix one basically looks for texture rather than nutrition, however. 
Nutrition is easy to supplement.</p>
<p> Repotting every third year is often helpful to keep the plant growing 
vigorously and looking its best. One may either repot it into a larger pot or 
divide the plant with a saw or hatchet. Annual pruning of old and dead wood 
will also improve the appearance and health of the plant.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> Fertilizers for Bamboo</p>
<p></p>
<p> <b><i></i></b> <b>Bamboo in the Ground</b> </p>
<p> Mar-Sep: Turf Supreme Fertilizer, 16-6-8. High in nitrogen to keep leaves 
green. Use one cup per 64 sq. feet (8 oz per 8' x 8'area), applied once a month.
</p>
<p> Oct-Feb: Apex Fertilizer, 6-24-24. For greater growth of roots and shoots. 
Use two cups per 64 sq. ft. (8 oz per 8' x 8' area), applied every 6 weeks.</p>
<p> After plants in the ground reach the desired height &amp; density, 
maintain with 16-6-8 twice a year in March &amp; June.</p>
<p> Also highly recommended for plants in the ground is composted horse 
manure, which is the bamboo fertilizer of choice in Asia. Every other year we 
spread it about 4&quot; deep in late fall to allow time for nitrogen conversion 
and use the rest of the year. For exceptionally tall growth, two applications 
per year may be used (early spring and late fall). During manure application 
years, additional chemical fertilizers are unnecessary. Use other manures if 
you have them available, but avoid nitrogen-hot ones, such as chicken and steer 
manure.</p>
<p> <b>Bamboo in Containers </b> </p>
<p> Year-Round, Indoors or Outdoors: Apex or Osmocote Fertilizer, 14-14-14 or 
16-16-16, four to six month slow-release. Apply the following amounts once 
every four to six months:</p>
<p> 1-gallon planter - 1 Tbsp </p>
<p> 5-gallon planter - 2 Tbsp </p>
<p> 15-gallon planter - &frac14; Cup </p>
<p> 25-gallon planter - &frac12; Cup </p>
<p> 3' x 3' planter - 1 Cup </p>
<p> </p>
<p> Watering of Bamboo</p>
<p></p>
<p> <b><i></i></b> First and foremost, keep your bamboo well watered. Bamboo 
likes plenty of deep watering - soaking down to at least 8-12 inches - and also 
good drainage. If you are keeping your plants in containers, or unable to 
transplant for a while, make sure the water is running out of the bottom of the 
pot each time you water. With ground plantings, a deep soaking less frequently 
is best, rather than a shallow watering every day. Then wait until the soil is 
just slightly damp - not wet, and not bone dry - before watering again. After 
the first few months, you can usually depend on a spray emitter irrigation 
system, using 2 to 4 high volume emitters per plant. (We do not recommend 
&quot;drip&quot; systems, as they do not emit a large enough volume of water 
and do not cover an area widely).</p>
<p> You will need to keep a close eye on your bamboo for a while to determine 
how much and how often to water in your particular microclimate, soil type and 
season. Occasionally, check moisture in the ground by digging down to a depth 
of at least 4 inches. If the soil is dry at 4 inches, water is not getting to 
the roots adequately. This is especially important during the first 2-3 months 
after transplanting. Also, as a rule of thumb, if the leaves are curling 
sideways (lengthwise) this means your bamboo is stressed and not getting enough 
water. If the leaves are drooping downward, your bamboo might be getting too 
much water and/or not enough drainage.</p>
<p> Also, in full sun, dry, windy or hot situations, it is ideal to spray the 
foliage with water once a day for an initial transition period of 2-4 weeks, 
and/or all summer in dry, hot climates. Regular overhead watering will reduce 
the amount of leaf drop during the transition, help your bamboo get established 
quickly, and increase its growth rate and ultimate height in dry climates.<br>

</p>
<p> </p>
<p> Possible Bamboo Pests</p>
<p></p>
<p> <b><i></i></b> Bamboo doesn't have many pests, but the pests they do have 
can be unsightly, if not a serious problem, unless some simple steps are taken.
</p>
<p>Gophers:<br>
 In northern California we have an abundance of gophers and 
squirrels, who think tender new rhizomes, bamboo shoots, and even new branch 
buds are a delicacy. To protect the rhizomes from gophers, the best solution is 
to plant inside of a &frac14; inch mesh metal gopher basket (which can be 
purchased). By the time the basket has rusted away, your bamboo is usually 
large and well established, and gophers cannot do enough damage to seriously 
harm your bamboo. If you find that new shoots or new branch buds are being 
chewed up by squirrels or gophers, painting on tabasco sauce is quite 
effective! (It may leave permanent stains on culms, however).</p>
<p>Insects: Mites, Aphids, Mealy Bugs, Scale, &amp; Ants: <br>
 It is much 
easier to keep mites out of your bamboo than it is to get rid of them once they 
have established themselves, and they can become a serious problem. Therefore, 
inspect any new bamboo you import into your garden. If mites are found, 
immediately separate the plants from other bamboos in your garden and clean 
thoroughly with a high-powered hose. See below for stronger measures, if 
required. Also, mites live in grass, so make an effort to keep grasses away 
from the base of your bamboo.</p>
<p> The symptoms of mites are small, regular, bleached-looking spots on the 
leaves. If you look very closely at the underside of the leaves, you will also 
see a very fine white web. The mites themselves are silvery grey and so small 
it is hard to see them without a magnifying glass. Often mites and aphids can 
be found together, and the treatment for both is the same.</p>
<p> Aphids are small crawling insects, either green or black in color. Mealy 
bugs appear usually in branch joints as little spots of &quot;white 
cotton&quot; which seem not to move at all. Scale looks like little, flat cones 
on branches and leaves, and are light colored when young, growing darker and 
more visible with age.</p>
<p> Aphids, mealy bugs and scale are sometimes accompanied by ants and/or 
sooty mold. These insects all produce a sticky secretion that can be eaten by 
ants, and sometimes a black sooty mold grows on it as well. So the presence of 
ants or sooty mold is often a sign of insect problems. The ants themselves do 
not harm the bamboo. Mealy bugs and scale are less of a problem in areas which 
receive hard frosts in winter.</p>
<p> With the interests of the environment in mind, below you will find our 
approaches to insect problems, with the most environmentally friendly listed 
first:</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p> </p> 
<ul> 
<li>If you have a pressure washer, use it once every week or two on the 
bamboo. This can be very effective against mites and other insects, and will 
not harm the leaves.
<p> </p></li> 
<li>Create an insecticidal soap made with Arm &amp; Hammer laundry detergent 
(powder), using 1 tablespoon per 1 gal water in a sprayer. Apply no more than 
once every two weeks. It turns leaves somewhat yellow, but is our treatment of 
choice because of its high effectiveness and low toxicity to the environment.
<p> </p></li> 
<li>Niem Oil: organic insecticide which kills mites, aphids, mealy bugs, white 
flies, and other insects. Follow directions on bottle, including all safety 
precautions. (Other &quot;ultra-fine&quot; oils can also be used).</li> </ul>If 
the above are not sufficiently effective and you have a large area of infested 
bamboo, you might consider the following more toxic substances:
<ul> 
<p> </p> 
<li>Malathion: kills pretty much all insects. Follow directions on bottle, 
including all safety precautions.
<p> </p></li> 
<li>Avid: kills specifically only mites and leaf miners, no other insects or 
birds. Has some systemic action, which makes it more effective with mites. Very 
expensive and hard to find in retail stores. Follow directions on bottle, 
including all safety precautions.</li> </ul> 
<p>Other possible pests - Bamboo in the West is a deer-proof plant. We have 
lots of deer here in Northern California, specifically the western mule deer, 
but have never had a problem with them. However, if bamboo is the<i>only</i> 
fodder for miles around they<i>might</i> eat it, especially tender new plants, 
and in that case, deer fencing around your new bamboo plants is a good idea. In 
the eastern U.S., the white-tailed deer co-evolved with our one native American 
species of bamboo, Arundinaria gigantea, and developed a taste for bamboo; and 
therefore, deer fencing is more imperative in the eastern states.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> Bamboo Plant Selection</p>
<p><b><i>Purpose: </i></b> In all its varied forms, the uses for bamboo are 
endless: striking, stand-alone specimen plants, a low variegated border, 
groundcover, accent plants in pots on a deck or patio, an interesting entryway, 
an Asian look for Japanese gardens, etc.</p>
<p> By far the most popular use of bamboo, however, is as fast-growing <b>
privacy screens and evergreen hedges.</b> Since bamboo is one of the fastest 
growing plants on the planet, bamboo screens and hedges can be created more 
quickly and inexpensively, compared to other plants or trees. Running bamboos 
fill in the spaces between the original plants the fastest, and even with 3' 
ft. spacing some screening can be achieved within 2-3 years with smaller size 
pots. Clumping bamboos take more time to fill in, but are ultimately extremely 
dense. Bamboo Sourcery also sells bamboos that are 10-20 ft, even 30 ft. tall 
already which can be used for &quot;instant screens.&quot; Almost any species 
can be used for effective screening, given that it will grow to the height you 
desire in the space that you can allow for it, and given that it is properly 
matched to your climate and planting area for cold hardiness and sun/shade.</p>
<p> We discuss below the various factors involved in selecting the plants that 
will best suit your needs and your location from the myriad of bamboos 
available. Four of the characteristics listed below are also listed with each 
species on our Price List.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> <b><i>Temperature: </i></b> Cold-hardiness, the lowest temperature 
tolerated by the root system of each species for 2-3 nights at a time, is 
listed on our Price Lists for each plant. (We tend not to use zone systems, 
since there are so many different systems). It's best to select bamboos that 
will tolerate temperatures well below the lowest temperatures you've 
experienced in perhaps the last 10 years in order to ensure healthy plants 
long-term. The cold-hardiness rating generally represents the threshold for 
root death. Somewhat less cold temperatures may cause only leaf burn and the 
loss of some leaves. If the canes are not damaged, new leaves will bud out 
again when the weather warms up. Colder temperatures experienced for several 
nights may kill the tops or even whole canes, causing them to turn beige. The 
parts of canes which are dead will not produce new leaves and may be cut off. 
However, if the roots survive, they will produce new shoots (culms) in spring 
or summer. Cold-hardiness can be extended considerably by putting a very deep 
mulch over the bamboos in the fall.</p>
<p> A few plants may also suffer from summer heat, such as Fargesias and some 
Chusqueas, which do not tolerate hot summer nights (over 70 F.).</p>
<p> <b><i>Sun:</i></b> Sun needs are listed on the Price Lists. Compare with 
the number of hours of direct sun which your plants will receive, and what part 
of the day they will be in sun. AM sun is cooler, but PM sun may be harsher, 
and is especially harsh in dry climates.</p>
<p> <b><i>Height &amp; Diameter:</i></b> Maximum height and diameter reached 
by each species in the<i>climate of origin</i> is listed in the Price List. 
This is the &quot;known reference point.&quot; However, height and diameter are 
affected by all aspects of climate: high and low temperatures, sun/shade 
exposure, humidity/aridity, water supplied, length of growing season, etc. For 
example, many of the bamboos like humidity and warmth, which makes them taller 
and larger in diameter; but aridity and/or cooler winters will prevent some 
plants from reaching their maximum size. Certain plants, when grown in 
California, reach 50% of the height they achieve in the climate of origin.</p>
<p>However, if your climate has hot, humid, long summers and stays well within 
the plant's cold tolerance, and if the plant is located in an appropriate 
amount of sun or shade and will have year-round water, you can generally expect 
the maximum height. Height in relation to climate is somewhat predictable for 
most of the species, so if in doubt, check with us about height for a species 
in your climate.</p>
<p> <b><i>Running or clumping type:</i></b> Listed on the Price Lists. 
Consider all of the advantages and disadvantages of clumpers and runners for 
you. For example, clumpers spread wide more slowly, but grow tall faster, and 
don&#146;t require root barrier for containment. Runners spread wide quickly to 
form screens, are less expensive, but sometimes require root barrier. For a 
more thorough discussion of the advantages and disadvantages and how to choose 
the best type for your situation, see the sectionClumping and Running Bamboos.
</p>
<p> <b><i>Look desired:</i></b> There is an amazing variety in bamboos to 
choose from. There arecanes with colors, stripes, large/small diameters, 
exposed or covered with foliage.Leaves may be striped and variegated, yellow or 
white with green, long and thin, large and wide, or very small.Growth habit may 
be vertical &amp; narrow, bushy &amp; wide, weeping, arching at the top, dense 
or airy, etc. Selection is all a matter of taste and purpose. Read on in the<i>
Species Description List</i> for more information and color photos. Keep in 
mind, also, that young plants may not immediately show colors and variegation 
when you receive them, but these features will become more prominent after the 
first year or two. And some features appear only in certain conditions and may 
not yet be present when you receive the plant. For example, red and purplish 
coloration of canes is only brought out by direct sun consistently hitting the 
canes themselves.</p>

<p> Regional Recommendations</p>
<p>We provide these suggestions to help you make your selections; <i>however, 
no guarantee of success is implied.</i> The following recommendations are 
generalizations, and do not account for microclimatic differences. Before 
selecting a species for your garden, always check the temperature, sun/shade 
ratings, height, and running/clumping type, and take into account your humidity 
levels.</p>
<p></p>
<p> <b><i>Far South (Tropical, semi-tropical, humid, warm year round, no frost)
</i></b> </p>
<p>Recommended: Bambusas, Chusqueas, Dendrocalamus, Drepanostachyums, 
Himalayacalamus, and all Phyllostachys, including Ph. nigra 'Henon,' except 
those noted below. Can be planted any time of year.</p>
<p> Not recommended: All Semiarundinarias, Phyllostachys nuda, and all Ph. 
nigras (except Ph. nigra 'Henon'), which need cold winters and cooler summer 
nights to do well. Also Fargesias, Himalayacalamus hookerianus &quot;Blue 
Bamboo,&quot; Chusquea circinata, and Ch. sulcata will not do well in areas 
where the temperatures exceed 100 F. and summer nights are above 70 F.</p>
<p> <b><i>South East (Hot, humid summers, some winter frost and down to 10 F. 
in some areas)</i></b> </p>
<p>Recommended: Almost anything will grow in this area if minimum temperature 
rating of species is appropriate. It is one of the few areas that Phyllostachys 
heterocycla pubescens 'Moso' grows well. All bamboos in this region are best 
planted in spring, to maximize growing season. In the fall, be sure to plant at 
least 3 months before your first frost. In colder areas, clumpers should be 
mulched before wintertime.</p>
<p> Not recommended: Chusquea circinata and Ch. sulcata, Fargesias, 
Himalayacalamus hookerianus &quot;Blue Bamboo,&quot; Phyllostachys nuda, and 
Semiarundinarias will not do well in areas where the temperatures exceed 100 F. 
and summer nights are above 70 F.</p>
<p> <b><i>South West (Low desert, with hot, dry summers and very light or no 
frost in winter)</i></b> </p>
<p> Recommended: Bambusas, Otateas, Phyllostachys and Semiarundinarias 
(exceptions noted below), Hibanobambusa, Pseudosasa japonica &quot;Arrow 
Bamboo&quot; and &quot;Pleioblastoides,&quot; and most Pleioblastus species. 
Drepanostachyum sengteeanum, Borinda boliana, Chusquea nigricans, and Ch. 
pittieri may also do ok. In shade, Yushania, some Himalayacalamus, and other 
Drepanostachyums may be grown as well. All variegated forms of the above genera 
and dwarf forms of Pleioblastus should also be grown in shade only. It's best 
to plant in mild fall weather to give plants time to get established before hot 
summer temperatures and take advantage of winter rains. Shield plants from 
extreme heat, cold, and sun when first planted. They will also need frequent 
watering in this climate, probably daily in summer. All plants will look 
somewhat better if in a little shade some part of the day. Installation of 
misters to mist the foliage daily is an optional but useful aid to help plants 
get established, look their best and grow ultimately taller.</p>
<p> Not recommended: Bambusa multiplex 'Silverstripe,' B. vulgaris vittata, 
Chusquea circinata and sulcata, Fargesias, Sasas, Himalayacalamus hookerianus 
&quot;Blue Bamboo,&quot; Indocalamus, Semiarundinaria fastuosa, and 
Phyllostachys nuda.</p>
<p> <b><i>High Desert (Hot, dry summers, cool nights, cold winters) </i></b> 
</p>
<p>Recommended: Pleioblastus, Semiarundinarias and Phyllostachys(except as 
noted below), Sasella masamuneana albostriata, Psuedosasa japonica &quot;Arrow 
Bamboo&quot; and 'Pleioblastoides,' and Hibanobambusas. Be sure to check that 
the temperature rating for the species is appropriate for your area. Chusquea 
nigricans may do all right, but there are no other clumpers that will do well 
in this climate. All variegated forms of the above genera and dwarf forms of 
Pleioblastus should be grown in shade only. Early spring after danger of frost 
is past is the best time to plant, in order to allow them to get established 
before the extreme heat arrives, and it's good to shelter plants from extreme 
heat, cold, or sun when first planted. Plants in this climate will need 
frequent watering, probably daily in summer. All plants will look somewhat 
better if in shade some part of the day. Installation of misters to mist the 
foliage daily is an optional but useful aid to help plants get established, 
look their best and grow ultimately taller.</p>
<p>Not recommended : Bambusas, Fargesias, Sasas, Indocalamus, Phyllostachys 
nuda, Semiarundinaria fastuosa.</p>
<p> <b><i>North (Cold winters down to 0 to &#150;20 F.)</i></b> </p>
<p>Recommended: all Fargesias (shade plants which are native to high mountain 
environments) are a good choice. Also many Phyllostachys, with bissetii, nuda, 
rubromarginata being among the most cold-hardy; Pleioblastus, particularly 
simonii and simonii 'heterophyllus'; many Semiarundinarias and Sasas. Be sure 
to check that the temperature rating for the species is appropriate for your 
area. Spring is the best planting season, allowing the whole growing season to 
get established before the next winter. In fall, plant at least 3 months before 
first frost. Mulching deeply in the cold season is also important, using 12 
inches of wood shavings, leaves, or hay and then removing the mulch in the 
spring. Some plants may freeze back in winter, but if mulched deeply will shoot 
up again in the spring. In the coldest regions mature heights will be lower.</p>
<p> Not recommended: any plants not designated to be cold-hardy enough for 
your lowest nighttime winter temperatures.</p>
<p> <b><i>Near Ocean (At least 200' away from water, with salt laden air, but 
not salt spray)</i></b> In general, bamboo does not like salt laden air and is 
prone to leaf tip burn. However, the following bamboos are relatively more salt 
tolerant.</p>
<p>Recommended: Assuming the species' temperature rating is appropriate for 
your area, some good choices are the Bambusas, Otatea acuminata, Pseudosasa 
japonica, Chimonobambusa quadrangularis, Semiarundinaria fastuosa, Pleioblastus 
hindsii, Pl. gramineus, Pl. simonii and simonii 'heterophyllus.' (Certain other 
families of bamboo can grow here but are much more vulnerable to leaf tip burn: 
Phyllostachys, Dendrocalamus, Fargesias and some Chusqueas, such as Ch. 
pittieri, sulcata, circinata, foliosa, and the culeous).</p>
<p> <b><i>West Coast</i></b> </p>
<p>This region has many highly varied microclimates, and thus can sustain a 
multitude of bamboo species. Hot and dry climates may choose from 
recommendations made for the southwest or high desert, colder mountain climates 
from the northern recommendations, etc.<i>Again, always make sure your 
temperatures, sun exposure, sun-shade, and humidity are appropriate for any 
particular species you may choose.</i> One nice feature is that Bamboo in the 
West is a deer-proof plant! Because there is no bamboo native to the west coast 
and the deer did not co-evolve with it, they will not eat bamboo unless it is 
the only fodder for miles around.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> Bamboo Indoors</p>
<p>Bamboos can sometimes be successfully and beautifully grown indoors, but 
only if you have a very green thumb and can give them adequate light, humidity, 
moving fresh air, and attentive observation and care. Also, because indoor 
environments are usually less than ideal, rotating your plants outdoors in mild 
conditions is often a wise practice for their long-term health. It is very 
important to read and apply all of the following guidelines if you want your 
bamboo houseplants to look healthy and beautiful for more than a few months. We 
provide no guarantee for plants placed in indoor environments, but if you are 
feeling adventurous and have a good green thumb, read on!</p>
<p></p>
<p> <b><i>Humidity:</i></b> Bamboos need high ambient moisture levels. Daily 
misting is recommended to compensate for the lower humidity of most interiors, 
especially while winter heating is in use. Humidity may also be provided by 
placing a small fountain or humidifier nearby. It's also best to keep plants in 
cooler locations and away from heaters.</p>
<p> <b><i>Light:</i></b> Bamboos do best indoors with <i>at least all day 
bright indirect natural light.</i> Most will do better with a few hours of <i>
direct sun.</i> The less light, the slower growth will be. Also, severe leaf 
drop may occur as a plant adjusts to less light and ambient moisture. If this 
occurs, often the plant will grow new leaves which are more acclimated to the 
indoor conditions. Please check the Sun/Shade Ratings listed under &quot;Indoor 
Plant Selection&quot; (or on our Price Lists for other plants that interest 
you).</p>
<p> <b><i>Soil:</i></b> We recommend a <i>light&#148;potting mix,</i> 
consisting of 1/3 soil, 1/3 peat moss, and 1/3 perlite in order provide 
excellent drainage and enable the soil to aerate and dry out more quickly after 
watering, to prevent root rot. If you also place a layer of gravel in the 
bottom of your pot (which must have holes for drainage, of course), you can 
place the pot in a saucer of water. Without the layer of gravel, the pot must 
be raised up to keep it out of the water that collects in the saucer.</p>
<p> <b><i>Watering:</i></b> For the same reasons, close attention to watering 
is very important for bamboos kept indoors. They should be watered in small 
amounts, deeply enough that roots are kept moist (a little water should run out 
the bottom), but not so much that the soil stays soggy for days. The top 
2-3&#148;inches of soil should be allowed to dry out before watering again. 
Below the 4&#148;inch depth, soil should be lightly moist around the roots at 
all times.</p>
<p> <b><i>Air Movement: </i></b> We have found it very helpful to <i>have some 
air flow</i> in the area with yor indoor bamboo, fresh air from outdoors, if 
possible. For this reason, entryways or rooms with windows near the plants that 
can be kept partially open seem to work best.</p>
<p> <b><i>Fertilizer:</i></b> For container-grown bamboos, we like the <i>
slow-release fertilizers</i> supplemented with trace minerals. We use Apex, 
14-14-14, a product similar to Osmocote, 14-14-14, with a 4-6 month release 
rate, depending on temperature. Dosage depends on size of container:</p>
<p> 1 Tbsp per 1 gal container, 2 Tbsp per 5 gal container, 4 Tbsp per 15 gal 
container, &frac12; C. per 25 gal container, 1 C. per 3' x 3' container.</p>
<p> <b><i>Height:</i></b> Indoors, bamboos generally grow only a <i>fraction 
of their maximum height and diameter,</i> so we recommend that you buy a plant 
that is already as close as possible to the size you ultimately want.</p>
<p> <b><i>Troubleshooting:</i></b> <i>Yellowing leaves</i> usually indicate 
either too little or too much water. If there is too much water and the roots 
are rotting, the leaves may look pale and droopy. Too little water may cause 
leaves to have brown tips, curl up, look dry and yellow, and begin to drop. The 
roots may have dried out just once or are root-bound and not absorbing water 
well. When under- or over-watering is corrected quickly, the plant will often 
re-leaf in a month or two and be healthy. Dig down 3-4 inches into the soil 
frequently to monitor moisture. Root-bound plants may be placed in a large 
saucer of water for a half-hour or so to soak up water from the bottom.</p>
<p>Bamboos grown indoors are more vulnerable to <i>insect pests and disease</i>
, as they are generally more stressed than they would be outdoors. Insects may 
be treated with the usual sprays (best applied outdoors). If the plant is 
small, simply washing the leaves under running water can be effective. (Please 
also seePossible Pests).</p>

<p> Removal of Bamboo</p>
<p>While we at Bamboo Sourcery are bamboo lovers, we recognize that 
occasionally there arises the need or desire to reduce or remove entirely a 
clump or a stand of bamboo. Unfortunately, this often occurs due to inadequate 
or inaccurate information available to consumers regarding the types of bamboo 
and effective containment methods. To learn more about the types of bamboo and 
containment methods for bamboo, please see the section titledClumping and 
Running Bamboos.</p>
<p></p>
<p> <b><i>Below are our recommended methods for removing bamboo. </i></b> </p>
<p><b>Removal Methods:</b> Many people ask about using Round-Up or other 
herbicides to kill bamboo. We do not recommend it. Not only will Round-up 
poison your soil (and possibly yourself), but the root mass left in the ground 
will make other uses or replanting of the same area difficult, if not 
impossible, and often the plants will still re-shoot. If you are, nevertheless, 
determined to use Round Up, remember that the poison is taken in through the 
leaves only, and it must be applied in an undiluted form, which is sometimes 
difficult to find.</p>
<p> The most effective method of removal of bamboo is to dig out the entire 
root and rhizome mass as thoroughly as possible, including fragments. To make 
the job easier, water the area deeply a few days before digging. Start on the 
outside of the clump or grove and work your way inward. The roots generally do 
not grow deeper than 6-18 inches and you usually can chop them into chunks and 
pull them out piece by piece. (If you want to remove super large chunks at one 
time, you can dig deeply around the circumference of a chunk, tie a strong rope 
or chain around it, and pull it out with a truck or tractor!)</p>
<p> It is likely that you will miss a few root fragments here and there, and 
over the next few seasons you may see an occasional shoot coming up. If you 
wish, you can force any root fragments to shoot by watering the area for 
awhile. Then, simply snap them off at soil level by hand while they are small 
and tender. The tiny root fragments will thus be deprived of nourishment from 
above and will die off. (This does not kill larger pieces of root).</p>
<p> <b>Tools for Removing Bamboo:</b> A shovel, hatchet, ax, pick, strong 
maddox, and a long, strong pry bar are the most common tools used for removing 
bamboo. When we dig a large area of a giant timber species, we also use a 
carbide-tipped chain saw and a special heavy duty chopping bar. If you have 
access to such tools, they will save you time and effort.</p>
<p> <b>Removal Services:</b> We are sometimes able to offer bamboo removal 
services. If you live within a 2-hour drive of Sebastopol, CA and have a 
significant amount of a species we can use, we may be able to come, during the 
appropriate digging seasons for your particular plant, and remove your bamboo. 
If you have bamboo that you would like us to remove, give us a phone call to 
initiate the conversation.</p>
<p> In order to determine whether the plant may be useful to us and the 
feasibility of digging, we will need a few photographs and/or cane samples sent 
to us: i.e. a length of cane with 1-2 nodes, branches, and leaves in a zip-loc 
bag and then in a brown envelope. We will also need some information about the 
height of your plant, size of the area it covers, soil type, surrounding 
structures, and any other relevant details, including your address and phone 
number. Scheduling is sometimes unpredictable, so flexibility in scheduling is 
very helpful.</p>

<p> Definitions</p>
<p></p>
<p> <b><i>Culm</i></b> A stem which is hollow except at the nodes, as are the 
bamboo canes.</p>
<p> <b><i>Diaphragm</i></b> The rigid membrane which forms the partition 
within the nodes, adding strength to the cane.</p>
<p> <b><i>Internode</i></b> Portion of the culm or cane between nodes.</p>
<p> <b><i>Node</i></b> Point on the culm from which branches and leaves grow 
on the outside, and where the diaphragm appears inside, separating hollow 
segments of the culm.</p>
<p> <b><i>Rhizome</i></b> A type of rootstock consisting of a creeping stem, 
usually growing horizontally underground. In the case of bamboo, the rhizomes 
are woody and segmented just like the culms.</p>
<p> <b><i>Sheath</i></b> An enclosing &quot;leaf&quot; which protects the 
young shoots, culms, and sometimes branches as well. May be dropped or retained 
as shoot matures.</p>
<p> <b><i>Shoot</i></b> New culm which has just broken ground, arising from a 
rhizome underground, completely covered with sheaths, and poised to demonstrate 
bamboo's reputation for phenomenally rapid growth. Bamboo shoots are a delicacy 
in Chinese cuisine.</p>
<p> <b><i>Sulcus</i></b> A groove along the length of the internode, sometimes 
of a different color from the rest of the cane.</p>

Semiarundinaria &nbsp; Shibataea &nbsp; Sinobambusa &nbsp; Thamnocalamus &nbsp; 
Yushania &nbsp; </p>
<p> Arundinaria</p>
<p>A genus of medium sized, hardy, running bamboos with 3-6 branches at each 
node, persistent culm sheaths, and no sulcus. Formerly, several Pleioblastus 
and Yushania were listed as Arundinaria. Shoots in late spring.</p>
<p> PSAT &nbsp; <b>Pseudosasa amabilis &quot;Tonkin Cane&quot; Formerly Known 
as Arundinaria amabilis</b>&nbsp; Known for the very high quality of its wood. 
Culms used to be imported from China for making split bamboo fishing poles. 
Vast quantities of stakes are still imported for the nursery trade. The species 
grows best in areas with hot, humid summers, where it reaches heights of 50' 
and 2 &frac12;&quot; in diameter. Best growth with good indirect light. Hardy 
to 10F. Formerly known as Arundinaria amabiis</p>
<p> </p>
<p> Bambusa</p>
<p>A genus of tropical and subtropical clumping bamboos from Asia, America and 
Africa that shoot all year 'round, especially summer and fall. Bambusas usually 
have round culms with numerous branches at each node, although one or two 
usually predominate. The species grows best in full sun and are successful in 
almost any climate, including coastal environments and even desert areas, as 
long as winter temperatures are not too cold.</p>
<p> BDOS &nbsp; <b>Bambusa dolichomerithalla 'Green Stripe'</b>&nbsp; Will 
grow to 18' in the Bay Area.</p>
<p> BDOSS &nbsp; <b>Bambusa Dolichomerithalla 'Silver Stripe'</b>&nbsp; 
Upright culms of this tight clumper are dark green with silver-white striping 
on long internodes, making it a beautiful accent clump. Traditionally used as a 
blowpipe for cooking in Taiwan. Hardy to 20 degrees F, grows 12' tall locally.
</p>
<p> BMP &nbsp; <b>Bambusa multiplex</b>&nbsp; The typical form of a very 
useful garden species. All forms share the moniker &quot;Hedge Bamboo,&quot; 
taking well to pruning and shaping. They tolerate colder temperatures than 
other Bambusas, being hardy to 13 degrees F. or more, and do well in most 
Northern California climate zones. Winter chill eliminates scale and mealy 
bugs, which commonly afflict them in warmer climates. Grows from 35' to 45' 
with 1 1/2&quot; diamters in climate of origin and 15-20' in N. California.</p>
<p> BMPA &nbsp; <b>Bambusa multiplex 'Alphonse Karr'</b>&nbsp; This is a very 
popular garden form with attractive gold culms with multiple green stripes. The 
new culms often have a pinkish or reddish cast. Shoots year 'round, growing up 
to 15' tall in the original environment and 12' to 20' in California.</p>
<p> BMPG &nbsp; <b>Bambusa multiplex 'Golden Goddess'</b>&nbsp; Growth habit 
similar to 'Fernleaf' but smaller, with smaller leaves and light orange canes. 
Usually 8 to 10' tall with &frac12;&quot; culms in northern California; 20' 
with 1/2&quot; culms in climate of origin. Great for low screen.</p>
<p> BMPGS &nbsp; <b>Bambusa multiplex 'Gold Stripe'</b>&nbsp; A moderate sized 
clumper similar in form to Bambusa multiplex 'Alphons Karr,' but with green 
culms exhibiting a single gold stripe in the grooves. Grows 25' tall with 
1.5&quot; diameter culms in the climate of origin, and approximately 15' tall 
in the SF Bay Area. Likes plenty of sun and is cold hardy to 18F.</p>
<p> BMPT &nbsp; <b>Bambusa multiplex 'Tiny Fern'</b>&nbsp; A wonderful bamboo 
for small hedges (3' max. ht.) or bonsai. Clusters of small, light 
grayish-green pointed leaves. Culms are light green to brown. A clumper hardy 
to 13 degrees, preferring half to-full day sun.</p>
<p> BOL &nbsp; <b>Bambusa oldhamii &quot;Giant Timber&quot;</b>&nbsp; A giant 
timber clumper growing 55' tall and 4&quot; in diameter in southern California 
and 20' to 30' up north. Long known for its large, olive green culms, vertical 
and clumping growth habit, and tasty shoots. Hardy to 20 degrees. Not good in 
desert climates.</p>
<p> BTE &nbsp; <b>Bambusa textilis 'Weaver's Bamboo'</b>&nbsp; A stately, 
upright giant timber clumper which grows 20 to 30' tall in northern California 
and taller in the south. Forms a very tight column of elegant, blue powdered, 1 
1/2 - 2&quot; blue-green canes, shaded by well foliated, arching tops. 
Excellent for either screening or free standing ornamental. Hardy to 13 
degrees. Considered a choice bamboo for weaving because of its strong yet 
pliable fibers and the absence of prominent culm nodes.</p>
<p> BTU &nbsp; <b>Bambusa tuldoides</b>&nbsp; Also known as &quot;Punting Pole 
Bamboo&quot; from its Asian heritage of poling boats. Culms are thick walled 
and straight, making them useful for many purposes. Under ideal conditions it 
can grow to 55' tall and 2 &frac14;&quot; in diameter. Olive green, shiny, 
upright and full foliage from bottom to top when mature. Hardy to 18 degrees.
</p>
<p> BVE &nbsp; <b>Bambusa ventricosa &quot;Buddha's Belly&quot;</b>&nbsp; 
Bright green culms sometimes develop characteristic internodal swelling when 
subject to high summer heat. In humid, warm climates it can grow 55' tall and 2 
&frac14;&quot; in diameter. Cold hardy to 18 degrees. Makes interesting subject 
for bonsai.</p>
<p> BVEK &nbsp; <b>Bambusa ventricosa 'Holochrysa Kimmei'</b>&nbsp; Very 
ornamental plant. Similarly to Bambusa ventricosa, culms sometimes develop 
characteristic internodal swelling when subject to high summer heat, but culm 
is yellow with multiple green stripes. In humid, warm climates it can grow 55' 
tall and 2 &frac14;&quot; in diameter. Will grow to 25' in the Bay Area. Cold 
hardy to 18 degrees. An especially exciting subject for bonsai.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> Bashania</p>
<p>A genus of two species of running bamboos from China which shoots in early 
spring.</p>
<p> BAF &nbsp; <b>Bashania fargesii</b>&nbsp; (Sometimes classified as 
Arundinaria fargesii). A new introduction with dense, vertical growth good for 
screening. Attractive dark green leaves, an inch or so wide by 6-8&quot; long, 
grace 15-20' silver/gray culms. Hardy to 0 degrees. Full sun to part shade.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> Borinda</p>
<p>A recently created genus of clumpers and &quot;open clumpers&quot; from the 
mountainous regions of Asia, composed of several species that had been 
previously assigned to other genera, such as Fargesia, Yushania, Arundinaria, 
Thamnocalamus, and Himalayacalamus. Classification of these bamboos has been 
problematic. Shooting season is variable.</p>
<p> BRA &nbsp; <b>Borinda albocerea</b>&nbsp; This bamboo is similar to 
Borinda boliana with blue-green powdery canes, but an open clumper with larger 
blue green leaves. Reaches 20' tall with 1' diameter culms in the climate of 
origin. Culms are very straight with slight arching at top. Will grow in bright 
indirect light to half-day sun. Cold hardy to 0.</p>
<p> BRF &nbsp; <b>Borinda fungosa (frmrly Fargesia fungosa) &quot;Chocolate 
Bamboo&quot;</b>&nbsp; Ornamental weeping bamboo that can be used as a screen 
or centerpiece. Likes a half-day of morning sun to half-day afternoon sun, and 
culms will turn chocolate-red and shiny with more sun. Has light green leaves, 
&frac12;&quot; x 3-5&quot;, which grow in small clusters at each node. This 
clumper grows to 14' and is hardy to 10 degrees.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> Brachystachyum</p>
<p>A one species genus from China similar to Semiarundinaria, which shoots in 
late spring.</p>
<p> BXD &nbsp; <b>Brachystachyum densiflorum</b>&nbsp; (Sometimes classified 
as Arundinaria densiflora or Bashania densiflora). A runner which grows to 6' 
tall, has swollen nodes, and is hardy to at least 5 degrees. Full sun to part 
shade. It was introduced to the USA in 1986, and not much is known about it.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> Chimonobambusa</p>
<p>A genus of medium sized bamboos from the Himalayas, China and Japan, which 
shoot fall and winter, and are difficult to propagate. Many branches per node. 
Thin culm sheaths fall away within a year. Those listed below are vigorous 
runners.</p>
<p> CBM &nbsp; <b>Chimonobambusa marmorea &quot;Red&quot;</b>&nbsp; Also known 
as &quot;Marbled&quot; Bamboo&#148; because its new shoots are marbled with 
cream and purple. Masses of bright green leaves form on multiple short 
branches. The culms will produce reddish color when grown in certain 
conditions: leaves must be stripped from the lower 2/3 of the culms, and the 
culms must be exposed to warm morning sun. However, in the afternoon the plant 
prefers shade, and hot afternoon sun will yellow the leaves. In hotter southern 
states, this plant must be kept in shade all day, and therefore cane color will 
be chestnut brown, as they usually are when shipped, also. With the proper sun 
exposure this makes an attractive container plant and is excellent for erosion 
control or hedges. Grows 6' to 8' tall and &frac14;&quot; to &frac12;&quot; in 
diameter. Hardy to 10.</p>
<p> CBMV &nbsp; <b>Chimonobambusa marmorea 'Variegata'</b>&nbsp; Same as CBM, 
except leaves are occasionally striped with narrow white lines. The cane also 
develop a showy, reddish color with sun exposure.</p>
<p> CBQ &nbsp; <b>Chimonobambusa quadrangularis &quot;Square&quot; </b>&nbsp; 
Unique in several ways, this plant has culms whose opposite sides are flat, 
forming a rounded square. Culms are rough to the touch with large nodes, and 
grow in an upright form. Graceful foliage is arranged in attractive tiers, 
creating a waterfall effect, or if topped, an umbrella-like shape. Looks best 
in part shade where leaves grow dark green; leaves exposed to bright sun are 
more yellow. This plant prefers cool daytime and nighttime temperatures, needs 
plentiful water, and is extra sensitive to dry conditions - may drop leaves if 
watering is missed. Can grow 25' tall and 1&frac12;&quot; in diameter. Hardy to 
10 F and tolerant of salt air.</p>
<p> CBQS &nbsp; <b>Chimonobambusa quadrangularis 'Suow'</b>&nbsp; Highly 
ornamental bamboo from China which is also good for screening . Similar to CBQ, 
but canes are gold with thin green stripes, and the new shoots are occasionally 
pink. Will grow indoors with 2-3 hours direct sun and misting. A good container 
plant.</p>
<p> CBTUM &nbsp; <b>Chimonobambusa tumidissinoda &quot;walking stick&quot; </b>
&nbsp; A rare Chinese bamboo noted for its widened culm nodes, like two closed 
cymbals. Used for walking sticks in Sichuan. Graceful, arching green culms with 
delicate palmate foliage resemble a large, lacey Japanese maple. Moderate 
runner.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> Chusquea</p>
<p>This genus comes from Central and South America where there are about 90 
species. Uniquely, the Chusqueas have solid culms and exhibit a whorl of 
multiple branches at each node, giving them a distinctive look. Leaves are 
usually small and narrow, and most are clumpers with gracefully arching or 
trailing culms and branches. While highly ornamental and mostly tolerant of 
acid soil, many have little heat tolerance and are difficult to establish. 
Coastal California and much of the San Francisco Bay Area have prime Chusquea 
climates. Most are newly introduced to the U.S. and hard to find. Shooting is 
in the spring for most species.</p>
<p> CHCI &nbsp; <b>Chusquea circinata</b>&nbsp; Beautiful tropical bamboo from 
Chiapas, Mexico, with long narrow leaves, &frac14;&quot; x 3 &frac12;&quot;. 
Culms grow up to 20' and are shiney dark brown with full sun and light brown 
with less sun. Has a feathery weeping look early in life. As the plant gets 
older, it becomes more upright and dense. Requires excellent drainage and tops 
will die in temperatures colder than 20 degrees for more than 10 days. Returns 
to same height if roots have been well-mulched. Does poorly in areas where 
summer temperatures go over 100 in the daytime and remain above 70 F. at night.
</p>
<p> CHCQ &nbsp; <b>Chusquea culeou (61-11) 'Chilean Straight'</b>&nbsp; A 
superlative hardy ornamental, long cultivated in England but new to the USA. 
One of the most beautiful and colorful Chusqueas, with dark blue-green nodes on 
lime-green to yellow culms. Mature plants look like tall clumps of giant 
feathers. They grow 20' tall at high elevations in Southern Chile and will 
thrive between 0 and 90 F.</p>
<p> CHCUM &nbsp; <b>Chusquea cumingii</b>&nbsp; A climbing bamboo with 
attractive bluish leaves and trailing canes which may reach 1&quot; in 
diameter, 40' in length, and 10' in height, depending on surrounding foliage, 
or a large arbor or trellis for support. Makes a very effective canopy; best in 
a large scale environment. A clumping type, but&#133;this is one of a handful 
of bamboos that grow new culms from the nodes of existing culms as well as from 
the root. Hardy to 10 degrees, preferring half to full day of sun.</p>
<p> CHCW &nbsp; <b>Chusquea culeou (6-11) 'Chilean Weeping'</b>&nbsp; New to 
the U.S. and another very striking Chusquea resembling CHCQ. Lime green culms 
with dark green nodes are tall and upright with weeping branches and delicate 
green foliage, also resembling giant, arching feathers. It grows to 20' tall 
with 1&frac12;&quot; diameter in N. California and is hardy to 0 degrees.</p>
<p> CHGI &nbsp; <b>Chusquea gigantea</b>&nbsp; Another Chusquea new to the 
U.S., growing about 25' tall and 1&frac34;&quot; inches in diameter with 
exceptionally long branches at 3-4&frac12; feet. This plant has an airy look, a 
delightful specimen plant but too open for screening.</p>
<p> CHMI &nbsp; <b>Chusquea mimosa 'Australis'</b>&nbsp; A new introduction 
from southern Brazil, this is a very interesting and delicate looking plant. 
Widely arching canes with small, delicate branches and leaves create a lacey 
fountain shape. In the spring, new shoots growing up through the clump are 
initially black, turning more burgundy color as they gain height. Then the culm 
sheaths fall, revealing light green smooth canes with slightly enlarged nodes. 
Grows to 15' tall with 1&quot; diameter canes in Brazil and is cold hardy to 20 
degrees. Prefers a half-day of sun, but may grow in full sun.</p>
<p> CHMU &nbsp; <b>Chusquea muelleri</b>&nbsp; A new introduction from Mexico, 
this is a small, deeply weeping, trailing bamboo, with dense foliage. Very thin 
culms have slightly widened nodes and medium size green leaves, 5&quot; x 
&frac34;&quot;. Best in bright light to a half-day of afternoon sun. Cold hardy 
to 22 F.</p>
<p> CHNI &nbsp; <b>Chusquea sp. 'Nigricans'</b>&nbsp; May be a dwarf form of 
culeou. It grows from 6 to 10', has stiffly vertical leaves and branches, and 
thrives between 0 and 90 degrees. It is one of the few bamboos which can grow 
in very wet soils, as well in typical garden conditions. Needs acid soil to 
look its best.</p>
<p> CHSU &nbsp; <b>Chusquea sulcata (seedlings)</b>&nbsp; One of the most 
beautiful, graceful and tropical looking bamboos, the sulcata has golden yellow 
culms with dark green widened nodes and very thin, feathery green leaves, 
4-5&quot; in length, on a whorl of short branches surrounding each node. Very 
delicate and airy with an umbrella shape overall, growing to 8-15' tall and 
1&quot; in diameter. Tolerates temperatures down to only 28 degrees and likes 
half to a full day of sun. Will die back at 20 degrees, but if mulched grows 
back to same height in one season. Does poorly in areas where summer 
temperatures go over 100 in the daytime and remain above 70 F. at night.</p>
<p> CHVA &nbsp; <b>Chusquea valdiviensis</b>&nbsp; The largest of the climbing 
bamboos and the most robust of Chilean bamboos, reaching heights of 80' by 
clambering up trees and draping them with curtains of foliage. Culms grow to 1 
&frac12;&quot; in diameter. Attractive on a large scale with trees or a large 
trellis for support. This is the largest of a handful of bamboos that grow new 
culms from the nodes of existing culms as well as from the root. Its 
temperature range is 10 to 100 degrees.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> Drepanostachyum</p>
<p>A genus of beautiful, medium sized, clumping, Himalayan bamboos. Culms arch 
in upper part and many thin branches half encircle each node. Shoots in the 
spring.</p>
<p> DRK &nbsp; <b>Drepanostachyum khasianum</b>&nbsp; Very similar to HCH but 
with blue-green culms. It also tolerates up to full day sun, and grows only to 
12 feet tall with &frac12;&quot; diameter culms.</p>
<p> DRS &nbsp; <b>Drepanostachyum sengteeanum </b>&nbsp; A tight clumper with 
slender, bright green culms which bend under the weight of abundant, small 
narrow leaves, creating a delicate, graceful look. It grows to 15 feet, does 
best in part shade, and is hardy to 17 degrees. It is an outstandingly 
beautiful ornamental.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> Fargesia</p>
<p>A genus of very hardy, small to medium-sized, clumping mountain bamboos 
from the cool alpine conifer forests of West and southwest China. These plants 
generally have thin canes with small leaves. Not recommended for Southeastern 
states in the US where nighttime summer temperatures remain above 70 F. The 
Fargesias are generally shade plants, but may tolerate more sun in the S.F. Bay 
Area when getting ample daily water. These plants shoot in the spring and fall.
</p>
<p> FADR &nbsp; <b>Fargesia dracocephala 'Rufa'</b>&nbsp; This versatile and 
popular new form of Fargesia is more sun and heat tolerant. Unlike most 
fargesias, this species can handle a full day of sun in N. Cal, which will 
produce lighter green, shiney leaves. In more shade the leaves will be dark 
green and shiney. In maturity, it has the characteristic weeping 
&quot;umbrella&quot; shape, and the culm sheaths and branches are copper 
colored. Hardy to -5 F.</p>
<p> FAM &nbsp; <b>Fargesia murieliae &quot;Umbrella Bamboo&quot;</b>&nbsp; An 
attractive clumping ornamental frequently used in European gardens, it is hardy 
to -20 degrees, likes shade, and grows to 15' tall. It is found in China at 
elevations of 10,000 feet, where it is an important food for the Giant Pandas. 
Small closely spaced bluish-green culms and delicate foliage create a deeply 
arching, umbrella-like form. Does not do well in summer heat, especially where 
nights do not cool down below 70 F. Flowered in 1994 in northern California.</p>
<p> FAN &nbsp; <b>Fargesia nitida (seedling)</b>&nbsp; Formerly known as 
Sinarundinaria nitida. A choice ornamental, it grows to 12 feet tall with 
slender arching branches, forming a fountain shape. Dark purplish culms are 
covered with a bluish-white powder when young, and leaves are delicate and 
attractive. Nitida is is exceptionally cold resistant, withstanding -15 
degrees, and is probably the most popular bamboo in northern Europe. Several 
related nitida varieties began flowering in Europe in 2002-2003. Flowering of 
the basic nitida occurred in N. California in 2003. New seedlings available now.
</p>
<p> </p>
<p> Gelidocalamus</p>
<p>A genus of small to medium sized, running bamboos botanically similar to 
Indocalamus and Chimonobambusa. Shoots in the spring.</p>
<p> GEG &nbsp; <b>Gelidocalamus (Arun) fangianus</b>&nbsp; A new introduction 
from West Sichuan China, where it is a primary food for the Giant Panda. This 
is a dwarf bamboo, growing to about 10' under conifers in China and reaching 
about 6' in northern California. Its best feature is its foliage with rather 
large leaves, about 2&quot; x 6&quot;,&#148; providing a texture that contrasts 
with other small-leaved plants. It is cold-hardy to 5 degrees.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> Hibanobambusa</p>
<p>A probable hybrid of Ph. nigra 'Henon' and Sasa veitchii f. tyugokensis 
from Mt. Hiba on Honshu, Japan. Both forms of the plant are aggressive runners 
with single branches and wide leaves up to 10&quot; long and 1&frac12;&quot; 
wide. The species grow about 15' tall, are cold hardy to -5 degrees, and and 
make good container plants and screens. Shoots in the spring.</p>
<p> HBT &nbsp; <b>Hibanobambusa tranquilans</b>&nbsp; Similar to HBTS, but 
this is the all green form.</p>
<p> HBTS &nbsp; <b>Hibanobambusa tranquilans 'Shiroshima'</b>&nbsp; Quite 
striking for its brightly variegated leaves, which are white and yellow with 
vivid green stripes and about 1 &frac12;&quot;&#148; x 8-10&quot;&#148; in 
size. Canes are fairly unremarkable and are largely hidden by the leaves in the 
mature plant. The young plant has a rather open look, however. Makes an 
excellent screen up to 15'&#146; in height. Likes full sun in temperate 
climates, but half to full-day of shade in very hot climates. Cold hardy to -5 
degrees.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> Himalayacalamus</p>
<p>A genus from Nepal to the north-eastern most part of India at elevations of 
2,250 to 2,750 m. Shoots in the spring.</p>
<p> HCA &nbsp; <b>Himalayacalamus asper (formerly NMC: Neo. microphyllus)</b>
&nbsp; This Tibetan bamboo is a stately and highly decorative ornamental. In 
more sun, culms turn maroon to almost black with delicate purplish green 
leaves. In summer shade, the culms remain rich green with white node rings. 
Culms get darker, sometimes almost black, in winter. Grows to 20' tall with 
1&frac12;&quot; in diameter in the climate of origin, 15'&#146; tall with 
&frac34;&quot;&#148; diameter here locally. Can tolerate temperatures down to 
only 15 degrees, and likes a half-day of sun. Shoots in the spring and fall.</p>
<p> HCC &nbsp; <b>Himalayacalamus cupreus</b>&nbsp; This new introduction is a 
tight clumper with foliage and growth habit similar to H. falconeri 
'Damarapa',&#146; with less arching at the top. New shoots are unique in having 
light green sheaths with spiraling dark green stripes. Sheaths are dropped 
quickly as the solid, dark green culms grow about 20' tall and 1 &frac14;&quot; 
diameter in the climate of origin. Cold hardy to 20 F. Most attractive as an 
isolated clump.</p>
<p> HCF &nbsp; <b>Himalayacalamus falconeri</b>&nbsp; This plant is a cultivar 
of Himalayacalamus falconeri 'Damarapa.' The culms are dark green without any 
striping, with abundant deep green leaves, 3/4&quot; wide by 4 1/2&quot; long, 
similar to the Damarapa. Tolerates a little more sun and more shade, but height 
and diameter are the same as the Damarapa.</p>
<p> HCFD &nbsp; <b>Him. falconeri 'Damarapa' (formerly Drepanostachum 
hookerianum)&quot;candy stripe&quot;</b>&nbsp; A highly decorative plant: gold 
canes with multiple green stripes, becoming shades of pink, cranberry, and 
purple with dark stripes in the spring and summer sun. Looks best with some 
leaves trimmed away from lower parts of canes to expose to sun and show off 
colors. Masses of leaves grow on long, slender, arching branchlets. Grows up to 
30' tall with 2&quot; diameter culms in the climate of origin. Here locally, it 
can reach 16' in height with 1.5&quot; diameters. Prefers a half-day of sun, 
morning or afternoon, except in climates with frequent 100 degree summer 
temperatures, where it tolerates am sun and bright, indirect light only. Hardy 
to 20 degrees.</p>
<p> HCHF &nbsp; <b>Himalayacalamus hookerianus 'Falcatus'</b>&nbsp; Almost 
identical in appearance to 'Blue Bamboo', but more gray-blue and shorter, 
growing about 15' in the climate of origin. Tolerates a full day of sun, but 
also is less cold hardy at 25 degrees.</p>
<p> HCP &nbsp; <b>Himalayacalamus porcatus</b>&nbsp; A very upright, tight 
clumper with light green leaves and misty green canes covered with a white 
powder. New shoot sheaths are almost black, but drop off as the culms grow, 
revealing nearly white new culms, which darken only slightly with age. Multiple 
short branches grow from each node, and culms reach 15' tall and 1&quot; in 
diameter in the climate of origin. Cold hardy to 20 F. Excellent specimen plant 
or hedge.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> Indocalamus</p>
<p>A genus of small Asian running bamboos which shoot in spring and are 
relatively hardy. Most have extremely large, wide, tropical-looking leaves and 
tolerate low light levels.</p>
<p> INLA &nbsp; <b>Indocalamus latifolius</b>&nbsp; Has leaves 2&quot; wide by 
1' long with a somewhat stiff and spiky appearance. It grows 6' tall, is hardy 
to 0 degrees, and prefers shade. A recent import.</p>
<p> INLO &nbsp; <b>Indocalamus longiauritus</b>&nbsp; Has attractive, dark 
green leaves on upright, solid culms. Leaves are up to 1 &frac14;&quot; wide by 
7&quot; long. Good house or garden plant. Tolerates a wide range of light 
exposure. Hardy to 0.</p>
<p> INT &nbsp; <b>Indocalamus tessellatus (Sasa tessellata)</b>&nbsp; Has the 
largest leaves of any bamboo in cultivation, sometimes up to 2' long by 4&quot; 
wide. It tolerates lower light levels than any other bamboo. Planted in total 
shade it forms an attractive 3' tall mounded ground cover. In bright light to 
filtered sun it may grow to 7' tall. This plant also makes a nice 
tropical-looking house plant. Hardy to -10 degrees.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> Indosasa</p>
<p></p>
<p> ISC &nbsp; <b>Indosasa crassifolia</b>&nbsp; Makes a great isolated clump 
or hedge. This is a decorative bamboo similar to INLO, but has smaller, 
narrower leaves, 1&quot; x 5&quot;.&#148;Leaves are smokey green color. Grows 
15' tall, 1&quot; in diameter. Grows in indirect light but prefers full sun in 
most environments. Shoots in the spring.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> Otatea</p>
<p>A genus of medium sized tropical Mexican bamboos which shoot in mid-summer.
</p>
<p> OAAZ &nbsp; <b>Otatea acuminata aztecorum &quot;Mexican Weeping&quot;</b>
&nbsp; A beautiful, drought resistant, clumping ornamental from the Chaparral 
of Mexico. Masses of long narrow leaves hang in graceful plumes on smokey green 
culms. This plant loves full sun and hot temperatures but may also be planted 
in light shade. Reaches 15' to 20' tall. It requires very good drainage, but 
tolerates salt air, alkalinity, and clay soils. The Otatea is hardy to only 20 
degrees and may experience leaf drop and cane die-back at 18 degrees. This 
plant may reach heights of 15-20' in ideal conditions with warm, relatively dry 
winters, but in areas with more frost and occasional temperatures in the teens, 
it may maintain heights of only 5'-12'.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> Phyllostachys</p>
<p>A genus of medium to giant runners with a distinct groove (sulcus) on the 
culm above paired branches. The heaviest shooting occurs in spring. All species 
have edible shoots. Nearly all can thrive with hot summers and cold winters. 
Most come from China. All grow best in full sun but can take some shade. The 
wide range of conditions under which this genus can be grown, plus its utility 
and beauty, have caused it to be the most commonly cultivated genus in the 
world.</p>
<p> PHAH &nbsp; <b>Ph. arcana</b>&nbsp; Great bamboo for erosion control, 
visual screening and edible shoots. Runner with shiny green culms that are 
occasionally zig-zagged at the base. Reaches up to 27' tall, with dark green 
leaves 5/8&quot; x 4&quot;. Hardy to 0 degrees and does best with half to full 
day sun.</p>
<p> PHAJ &nbsp; <b>Ph. aurea &quot;Hedge Bamboo&quot; &quot;Golden&quot; </b>
&nbsp; (also known as &quot;Golden Bamboo&quot;) The most common and popular 
bamboo in much of the U.S, it is easy to grow, drought resistant, and great for 
screens and hedges, as well as containers. Dense light green foliage covers the 
plant from top to bottom. Culms are light green with a white node ring, turning 
more yellow if exposed to direct sun. Distinguishing characteristic is the 
short, knobby, bulging internodes at the base of its culms, adding interest. 
The usual height here in N. California is between 10' and 15' with 2&quot; 
diameter culms, but it can reach 16' in its native environment. Because it can 
spread aggressively, it forms screens rapidly, and containment is recommended. 
It is hardy to 0 degrees and shoots in the spring.</p>
<p> PHAM &nbsp; <b>Ph. aurea 'Flavescens-inversa'</b>&nbsp; A very striking 
cultivar of PHAJ. The green canes show off a wide yellow stripe in the sulcus, 
creating alternating stripes of varying lengths up the cane.</p>
<p> PHAN &nbsp; <b>Phyllostachys aurea 'Holochrysa' &quot;True Gold&quot;</b>
&nbsp; A cultivar of PHAJ with light gold culms and occasional thin, vertical 
green stripes. New shoots come up green and gradually turn light yellow 
regardless of sun exposure.</p>
<p> PHAO &nbsp; <b>Ph. aurea 'Koi' </b>&nbsp; A cultivar of PHAJ with a soft 
green stripe in the sulcus on light yellow culms and occasional white stripes 
on the leaves. Unique to this bamboo is the extremely variable internode length 
and occasional bulging internodes, giving the canes a knobby look. Similar to 
Ph. aurea in its rapid growth, hardiness, versatility and resilience.</p>
<p> PHAQ &nbsp; <b>Ph. aureosulcata &quot;Yellow Groove&quot;</b>&nbsp; This 
plant is a real stand-out with brightly colored green canes and a bold yellow 
vertical stripe in the sulcus. Frequently grows with a pronounced zig-zag at 
the base ('crookstem'). It is a vigorous runner with dark green leaves and 
tasty shoots. Maximum height (near Prattsville, Alabama) is 45' and 3&quot; in 
diameter, while in Northern California it usually grows 25-30'. This 
exceptionally cold tolerant bamboo withstands -10 degrees. The aureosulcata 
group is great for medium to large size hedges and specimen plants.</p>
<p> PHAR &nbsp; <b>Ph. aureosulcata 'Alata' </b>&nbsp; A dark green form of 
aureosulcata with frequent zig-zag in the canes and no stripe in the sulcus.</p>
<p> PHARR &nbsp; <b>Ph. aureosulcata 'Harbin'</b>&nbsp; This cultivar has 
yellow culms with multiple green grooves running the length of each internode, 
with no sulcus stripe.</p>
<p> PHAS &nbsp; <b>Ph. aureosulcata 'Spectabilis' </b>&nbsp; A very attractive 
recent introduction with a green sulcus on bright yellow culms, turning 
cranberry red where sun strikes the cane in summer. A beautiful erect specimen 
or hedge plant.</p>
<p> PHAU &nbsp; <b>Ph. aureosulcata 'Lama Temple'</b>&nbsp; A bright yellow 
cultivar of PHAS with occasional thin, vertical, green stripes around the cane 
(no sulcus stripe).</p>
<p> PHB &nbsp; <b>Ph. bambusoides &quot;Madake&quot;</b>&nbsp; Also known as 
'Giant Japanese Timber Bamboo',&#148;this plant has bright green smooth canes 
and medium size leaves. One of the largest, reliable, easy-to-grow, temperate 
climate, giant bamboo, it can grow 72' tall and 6&quot; in diameter and 
produces excellent wood. It may reach 50' with 5&quot; diameter culms in N. 
California, and lends a strong, vertical, structural quality to any landscape. 
Before flowering in the 60's and 70's, it was the predominate bamboo cultivated 
in Japan. Next flowering and die-back not due until approximately 2085. Hardy 
to -5 degrees. Almost identical to Ph. vivax.</p>
<p> PHBA &nbsp; <b>Ph. bambusoides holochrysa 'All Gold'</b>&nbsp; Decorative 
orangey beige culm with a few thin green stripes, and green leaves with cream 
to gold stripes. Culms almost translucent when sun is shining through them. 
Grows up to 30' tall 2' in diameter. Hardy to 0 degrees and does well in 
half-day morning sun to full sun.</p>
<p> PHBAS &nbsp; <b>Ph. bambusoides 'Aureostriata'</b>&nbsp; This unique plant 
was brought from Japan years ago by Gerald Bol. It sports gold stripes on green 
leaves as well as occasional white stripe on the green canes. Otherwise similar 
to PHBA. Tolerates full sun. Not to be confused with 'Richard Haubrich'.</p>
<p> PHBC &nbsp; <b>Ph. bambusoides 'Castillon'</b>&nbsp; This form, a mutation 
of Ph. bambusoides, has yellow culms with a light green stripe in the sulcus, 
and occasionally a few bright green stripes elsewhere. Leaves are green with a 
few bright yellow stripes. It grows up to 35' tall and 2&quot; in diameter in 
the climate of origin and about 25' tall in the SF Bay Area. This plant is 
hardy to 0 degrees and likes half to full day direct sunlight</p>
<p> PHBI &nbsp; <b>Ph. bambusoides 'Castillon Inversa'</b>&nbsp; A good 
ornamental hedge or centerpiece, this form is the reverse of PHBC with green 
culms and yellow stripes in a striated sulcus.</p>
<p> PHBR &nbsp; <b>Ph. bambusoides 'Slender Crookstem'</b>&nbsp; This form of 
bambusoides often grows with marked zig-zags or S-curves in the lower part of 
the culm, which is quite striking on such large canes. Smaller than the typical 
form, it grows 40-65' tall and 3-5&quot; in diameter in its native environment, 
and still is one of the tallest growing bamboos in northern California, 
reaching 50' tall and 5&quot; diameter.</p>
<p> PHBY &nbsp; <b>Ph. bissetii </b>&nbsp; A handsome, medium sized species 
with dark green, shiney leaves and green culms. Excellent for fast-growing, 
dense screens and hedges. Exceptionally hardy, withstanding temperatures to -15 
degrees. If mulched, the rhizomes alone can probably withstand -30 degrees and 
shoot again in the spring. Does well in a wide range of light conditions. Grows 
to 23' tall and 1&quot; in diameter in the climate of origin and 15-18' tall in 
the SF Bay Area, but can be pruned to any height. Vigorous runner.</p>
<p> PHC &nbsp; <b>Ph. atrovaginata (congesta) &quot;Incense Bam.&quot;</b>
&nbsp; Especially useful in landscapes where the timber bamboo look is desired, 
but with less height, this plant gets 2&quot; in diameter and 25' tall locally. 
Air canals in rhizomes and roots make it well adapted for wetter soils. Surface 
of new culms have a sandalwood scent when rubbed in the warm sun. New shoots 
are excellent for eating . Runner that establishes and grows rapidly. Hardy to 
-15 degress.</p>
<p> PHDEC &nbsp; <b>Ph. decora</b>&nbsp; Culms are green with subtle rusty 
mottling. Grows to about 20' tall and 1 &frac14;&quot; in diameter. Hardy to -5 
degrees. In China it is called the Beautiful Bamboo.</p>
<p> PHDUL &nbsp; <b>Ph. dulcis</b>&nbsp; Arching, soft green culms with 
occasional white stripes grow to 40' and 3&quot; in diameter. They tend to have 
large diameter for their height. Leaves are olive green. Cold hardy to -10 
degrees and can grow close to full height even with those temperatures in 
winter. Fast growing giant bamboo with tasty shoots.</p>
<p> PHF &nbsp; <b>Ph. flexuosa</b>&nbsp; Named for the distinct zig-zag 
pattern shown by some of the culms. Medium size lime-green leaves grow on 
darker green canes, which turn burgundy color in direct sun. Grows up to 31' 
tall with 2&frac34;&quot; diameter culms in the climate of origin, but is 
typically half that tall in the SF Bay Area, where it is usually grown as a 
short, arching hedge. Good for containers and great for erosion control. Cold 
hardy to -15 degrees. Likes full sun to a half-day of afternoon sun. Flowered 
and produced seed at Bamboo Sourcery in 1995.</p>
<p> PHG &nbsp; <b>Ph. glauca</b>&nbsp; Grows in China to 70' tall and 5&quot; 
in diameter, while locally in Northern California it grows 40' tall and 2 
&frac12;&quot; in diameter. It is a vigorous runner, hardy to -5 degrees. The 
young culms have a distinctive white powder creating a blue-green tone. As 
culms mature, they become a pale, yellow green. Excellent tolerance for both 
drought and alkalinity. This is a plant for many uses, such as hedging, erosion 
control, crafts and fencing.</p>
<p> PHHP &nbsp; <b>Ph. heterocycla 'Pubescens' (china) &quot;Moso&quot;</b>
&nbsp; The largest growing species of the genus and considered by many to be 
the most beautiful, Moso is the most cultivated bamboo in China and Japan. The 
tops arch gracefully with masses of small leaves, reaching up to 80' tall with 
culms 8&quot; in diameter in the climate of origin. It produces especially 
tasty shoots in tropical environments and is used throughout Asia for 
construction. Moso is difficult to establish and requires lots of water, 
acidity, tropical humidity and heat to reach its full potential. It remains 
much shorter in less ideal circumstances (including California). Not for desert 
environments. Small plants should be partially shaded. Hardy to 0 degrees.</p>
<p> PHHU &nbsp; <b>Ph. humilis</b>&nbsp; Great for erosion control or as a 
hedge, this vertical bamboo with small leaves is distinctive because of its 
short culm internodes (4-6&quot;), and the first few internodes of each branch 
are hollow. A quick grower, 15-20' tall, hardy to 0 degrees, it likes half to 
full day sun. Leaves and culms are olive green.</p>
<p> PHI &nbsp; <b>Ph. iridescens</b>&nbsp; Beautiful dark green leaves and 
culms and is useful as a visual screen and wind break. Grows up to 36' tall and 
2 3/4&quot; in diameter in half-day afternoon sun or all day full sun. Hardy to 
0 degrees.</p>
<p> PHNF &nbsp; <b>Ph. nigra &quot;Black Bamboo&quot; </b>&nbsp; One of the 
most popular bamboos, both for the black culms and the plumed masses of bright 
green leaves. The culms come up green and slowly turn black during the first 
year or two. Locally, in northern California, it grows about 20-30' tall and 1 
&frac12;&quot; in diameter. The Black Bamboo prefers full sun and grows very 
slowly in complete shade, almost like a clumper. It is hardy to heat and 
drought tolerant, but is sensitive to salts and minerals in the air, water and 
soil, which readily result in leaf tip burn.</p>
<p> PHNFF &nbsp; <b>Ph. nigra 'Daikokuchiku' &quot;Giant Black&quot;</b>&nbsp; 
Similar to above Black Bamboo, except that this clone has reached 57' tall and 
3.3&quot; in diameter, possibly the greatest height of any bamboo in northern 
California. The parent grove is located in Folsom, California and is growing in 
well irrigated, deep, sandy loam. Summer temperatures are very hot, above 100 
degrees for weeks on end. It does well in 80 degree summer heat as well. In 
many other California locations it more typically grows to about 50' in height.
</p>
<p> PHNG &nbsp; <b>Ph. nigra 'Bory' &quot;Leopard Bamboo&quot;</b>&nbsp; A 
large relative of Black Bamboo, which, instead of turning black, develops large 
decorative brown/black spots on 3&quot; diameter green culms. It grows up to 
50' tall and takes temperatures down to -5 degrees. As with the other forms of 
Ph. nigra, 'Bory' has very beautiful structure and foliage. Excellent tolerance 
for summer heat, winter cold, and drought. Cut and cured canes become dark 
yellow to beige with black and brown mottling, which make them exceptionally 
beautiful for musical instruments, furniture and crafts.</p>
<p> PHNH &nbsp; <b>Ph. nigra 'Hale'</b>&nbsp; This type of black bamboo shows 
its color sooner than any other with new shoots that are mostly black when they 
break ground and turning completely black in 3-6 months. Canes are consistently 
solid black, even in the young plants. Grows to 20-30' tall, is hardy to -5 
degrees and needs half to full day sun. Good in pots or in the ground as a 
hedge.</p>
<p> PHNI &nbsp; <b>Ph. nigra 'Henon'</b>&nbsp; An all green form of Black 
Bamboo which can grow 60' tall and 5&quot; in diameter in the climate of 
origin. Reaches about 35' in northern California. Outstandingly beautiful 
foliage and craftsman quality wood. Hardy to -5 degrees. Has noteworthy drought 
resistance and grows well under a wide range of conditions.</p>
<p> PHNID &nbsp; <b>Phyllostachys nigra 'Henon' &quot;Dwarf&quot;</b>&nbsp; A 
dwarf form of Ph. nigra 'Henon' grown from seeds obtained by Hastings Schmidt 
from China, this plant has never grown to more than 30&quot; tall in the 17 
years it's been cultivated at Bamboo Sourcery. Color and other characteristics 
are identical to the 'Henon', but this dwarf is now the smallest known plant in 
the Phyllostachys genus.</p>
<p> PHNM &nbsp; <b>Ph. nigra 'Megurochiku'</b>&nbsp; Grows and looks very 
similar to 'Henon' but with the addition of a brown or purplish-black stripe in 
the grooves on the culms. Also drought resistant. Hardy to -5.</p>
<p> PHNU &nbsp; <b>Ph. nuda</b>&nbsp; This is reputed to be the most cold 
hardy species of the genus, tolerating -20 degrees. It forms attractive groves 
up to 34' tall with culms 1 &frac34;&quot; in diameter. Culms and leaves are 
dark green and arching at the very top. P. nuda gets its name from its ability 
to become deciduous with extreme cold. Does not do well in southern states with 
very hot summers.</p>
<p> PHPS &nbsp; <b>Ph. heteroclada 'Solid Stem'</b>&nbsp; This variety has 
light green culm sheaths with a white edge which are retained, creating a 
pattern on the culm. Grows to 20' tall and 1&quot; in diameter. It has nearly 
solid culms and is otherwise similar to the form above. Exceptionally hardy to 
wind, drought &amp; aridity. Survives -20 F.</p>
<p> PHPT &nbsp; <b>Ph. heteroclada 'Straight Stem' &quot;Water Bamboo&quot;</b>
&nbsp; Now considered to be the primary species, growing larger, up to 33' and 
1 &frac12;&quot; in diameter and with less zig-zag than the two above. It is 
also hardier, going down to -5 degrees. Culm sheaths are soft green.</p>
<p> PHR &nbsp; <b>Ph. rubromarginata</b>&nbsp; Another exceptionally cold 
tolerant species withstanding -15 degrees. It behaves as a clumper in cool 
summer climates and a runner in warm ones. Grows to 55' tall and 3 
&frac12;&quot; in diameter and is noted for its good quality wood with long 
internodes and edible shoots. Tolerates alkalinity.</p>
<p> PHVC &nbsp; <b>Ph. violascens</b>&nbsp; A totally unique bamboo with thin

culms with a white node ring, providing excellent quality straight wood, often 
used in furniture, and superior shoots for eating. Grows 35' tall on 2&quot; 
culms. Hardy to -5 degrees. Great bamboo to work with!</p>
<p> PHVJ &nbsp; <b>Ph. viridis 'Houzeau'</b>&nbsp; Very similar to Ph. viridis 
'Robert Young' with reverse coloring: culms are green with a single yellow 
stripe in the sulcus.</p>
<p> PHVR &nbsp; <b>Ph. viridis 'Robert Young'</b>&nbsp; A handsome striped 
form with occasional green stripes on vivid yellow culms. Grows 40' tall and 
3&quot; in diameter. Wood is of high quality and shoots are tasty. It is 
characterized by the grainy quality of the culm surface which can be felt by 
running the edge of your thumbnail up and down the culm surface. It is hardy to 
-5 degrees and is an exceptionally vigorous runner, so we recommend using 60 
mil polyethylene plastic root barrier.</p>
<p> PHVX &nbsp; <b>Ph. vivax</b>&nbsp; Probably a form of Phyllostachys 
Bambusoides, as they are nearly identical and can be used interchangeably. This 
plant grows up to 72' tall and 6&quot; in diameter in its native climate. The 
vivax, along with Ph. bambusoides 'Slender Crookstem'(PHBR) and Ph. nigra 
'Daikokuchiku' &#147;'Giant Black' (PHNFF) grow the largest in northern 
California. The vivax reaches 50' and 5&quot; in diameter. Canes are bright 
green and smooth. New shoots have culm sheaths that are dark brown with light 
brown spots. Vivax is hardy to -5 degrees.</p>
<p> PHVXA &nbsp; <b>Phyllostachys vivax 'Aureocaulis'</b>&nbsp; Identical to 
Ph. vivax, except that the culms are bright gold with occasional, random dark 
green stripes and bright, shiney green leaves - an exceptionally striking 
variety!</p>
<p> </p>
<p> Pleioblastus</p>
<p>A genus of small to medium size running bamboos with numerous branches at 
each node and culm sheaths which remain attached to the culm. The many dwarf 
species, often variegated, make good ground covers, hedges, and container 
specimens, which benefit from an annual winter clipping to keep them low, 
uniform, and attractive. In cold climates, they may be grown herbaciously by 
mulching heavily during the winter, and will survive an additional 10 to 20 
degrees colder than listed and produce new top growth in the spring. Shoots in 
the spring.</p>
<p> PLAR &nbsp; <b>Pleioblastus argenteostriatus</b>&nbsp; A 3' tall, running 
dwarf with white striped leaves. Shade loving but can withstand some sun. Makes

this is an excellent choice for screens and hedges in very cold winter 
locations or near the ocean. Leaves are long and narrow, 10&quot; x 3/4&quot;. 
Culms are olive green and are useful for many purposes, at about 20' of height 
by 1&quot; diameter with some arching at the top. This is a slow spreader, 
tolerant to salt air and cold hardy to -20 F. Plant in full sun to part shade. 
Young shoots are edible.</p>
<p> PLVS &nbsp; <b>Pl. viridistriatus &quot;Dwarf Greenstripe&quot; </b>&nbsp; 
Has very attractive bright yellow leaves with sharp green stripes. Great 
against a dark backdrop. Half-day of morning sun produces a deep yellow color 
and requires plenty of watering. Half-day to a full-day of shade produces an 
equally beautiful light lime-green color contrasting with the dark green 
stripes. It generally grows 3' tall but can grow twice that. Hardy to -10 
degrees and more if heavily mulched. Best when pruned down and allowed to 
re-grow fresh new leaves in early spring.</p>
<p> PLVSC &nbsp; <b>Pleioblastus viridistriatus 'Chrysophyllus'</b>&nbsp; 
Similar to PLVS but some leaves are green and some yellow with touches of 
green, but have no stripes. It is slower growing.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> Pseudosasa</p>
<p>This Asian genus consists of small to medium sized, running bamboos with 
usually one and never more than three branches per node. Good as a hedge or 
ground cover. Shoots in the spring.</p>
<p> PSJ &nbsp; <b>Pseudosasa japonica &quot;Arrow Bamboo&quot; </b>&nbsp; 
Known as &quot;Arrow Bamboo&quot; for its historic use, this bamboo produces 
thin, strong, and straight green culms which retain the light brown culm 
sheaths for about 6 months. In full sun it makes an attractive 15' tall, dense 
screen with large dark green leaves. In shade, it grows a lighter green and 
more openly. Hardy to 0 degrees. Tolerant to salt air, wind and drought.</p>
<p> PSJP &nbsp; <b>Pseudosasa japonica 'Pleioblastoides'</b>&nbsp; Similar to 
the basic species, this japonica is drought, wind, and salt tolerant. It is 
good for hedges up to about 8' in height in N. Cal, though it grows to 18' in 
the climate of origin. It is distinctive in that its culms turn somewhat 
reddish when receiving full sun on the culm itself, but otherwise both culms 
and leaves are dark green. Also, it has three branches at each node instead of 
just one. Cold hardy to 0 F.</p>
<p> PSJT &nbsp; <b>Pseudosasa japonica 'Tsutsumiana'</b>&nbsp; Also known as 
&quot;Scallion Bamboo.&quot; Similar to the above, except it is lower growing 
and develops interesting, bulging internodes and only grows 10' tall.</p>

<p>A genus of medium sized, clumping mountain bamboos from Asia. Shoots in the 
spring.</p>
<p> YUA &nbsp; <b>Yushania anceps</b>&nbsp; A very graceful mountain bamboo 
from Formosa and the Philippines. Myriads of small leaves form lovely patterns 
on blue-green culms. As an &#147;open clumper,&#148; culms are erect with some 
distance from each other, but the tops of this plant are deeply weeping. It 
readily forms dense masses of foliage in less light than most bamboos and may 
be effectively used for screening in shady places. When grown in full sun its 
leaves tend to curl. It can reach 12' with culms &frac34;&quot; in diameter. 
Hardy to 0 degrees.</p>
<p> YUANP &nbsp; <b>Yushania anceps 'Pitt White'</b>&nbsp; Possibly the same 
as YUA, but this clone is a seedling of a plant which grew 32' tall at Pitt
