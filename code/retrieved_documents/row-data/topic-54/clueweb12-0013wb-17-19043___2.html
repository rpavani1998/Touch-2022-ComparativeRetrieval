<p>Magnolia virginiana 'Moon Glow'</p> 
<p>'Moon Glow' Sweetbay Magnolia</p> <br>

<p>'Moon Glow' is a vigorous grower with a distinctly upright growth habit and 
lemon-scented, creamy white flowers bloom well after the last frost. Plants 
flower heavily in mid-spring then continue sporadically through summer. The 
foliage is shiny green on top with silver on the lower side. Foliage is 
evergreen to semi-evergreen, depending on where you live. The cone-like fruits 
contain bright red seeds and are an important source of food for birds in the 
fall.<br>
