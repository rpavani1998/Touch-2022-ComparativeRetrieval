the larvae of viceroy, striped hairstreak, and Canadian tiger swallowtail 
butterflies. And the grand finale comes in fall with brilliant oranges, yellows 
and reds as the leaves prepare to drop. Amelanchier laevis is found in moist 
woods and meadows, but tolerates most any garden situation. It will bloom more 
in full sun, but have a more open and graceful habit in shade. It is drought 
tolerant once established, but will grow taller and faster in consistently 
moist soils. Amelanchier can be grown as a small tree pruned to become a 
densely branched shrub.  [ More Information ] <br>

9-12&rdquo; wide, with grayish leaves covered in silvery hairs. Bears single 
daisy-like flowers (1&rdquo; across) with yellow centers and white 'petals' 
with red undersides. The unique coloration of the flowers add much to the charm 
of the plant; in appearance, flowers almost look dipped in red blood, and for 
the imaginative plant connoisseur, they can almost evoke mental images of 
classical mythological stories of lore. Flowers close in the evenings and on 
cloudy days, and are borne in late spring and early summer. As a Mediterranean 
plant, Mt. Atlas daisy requires excellent drainage, and are ideally suited for 
hot, sunny, and dry rock gardens, trough gardens, rock walls, or rock crevices.

Athyrium filix-femina 'Victoriae' <br>
<b>Common Name: Victoria Lady Fern</b>  
&quot;This is the most spectacular of all cultivars in its magnificent frond 
architecture. It is really the Queen of Green&quot;, according to Dr. John 
Mickel former curator of ferns at the New York Botanical Garden and author of 
&quot;Ferns for American Gardens&quot;. As with other forms of lady ferns there 
is so much variability with spore production that it is necessary to produce 
this form in tissue culture, so its clones are identical to the parent. This 
superb selection has fronds whose pinnae (leaflets) crisscross to form x's and 
has crested pinnae tips. Another superior cultivar in the Mickel Collection 
&trade;.  [ More Information ] <br>

Athyrium 
nipponicum 'Regal Red' <br>
<b>Common Name: Japanese Painted Fern</b>  Handsome 
and ruffled, this high-color selection has been a much requested Japanese 
Painted Fern. The dark violet red interior of each 'Regal Red' frond is 
contrasted by bright silver edges making each leaflet distinct and creating an 
overall tapestry effect. The pinnules also twist a little giving the frond a 
&quot;fluffed&quot; up look. 'Regal Red' combines beautifully with red-purple 
Heucheras such as 'Plum Pudding' and blue sedges like Carex platyphylla or C. 
'Blue Zinger'. The fronds work well in cut flower arrangements, providing 
lasting color and soft texture. Unique and beautiful!  [ More Information ] <br>

Athyrium x 'Branford Rambler' <br>
<b>Common Name: Running Lady Fern
</b>  This is a good, frisky new fern from John Mickel of Bradford, CT. It has 
been billed as a running painted fern, but we have found it to be mostly green 
with red tones along the stem. Even so, it is a lovely and vigorous plant with 
delicate bright green fronds; a lively groundcover that is very easy to grow 
and not at all fussy; a deciduous, noninvasive creeper that fills in quickly, 
but doesn't take over. Hybridized by the legendary Nick Nicou, of Branford, CT.
