<h3>[1835]</h3> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>SALEM, <em>June</em> 15, 1835.--A walk down to the Juniper. The shore of 
the coves strewn with bunches of sea-weed, driven in by recent winds. 
Eel-grass, rolled and bundled up, and entangled with it,--large marine 
vegetables, of an olive-color, with round, slender, snake-like stalks, four or 
five feet long, and nearly two feet broad: these are the herbage of the deep 
sea. Shoals of fishes, at a little distance from the shore, discernible by 
their fins out of water. Among the heaps of sea-weed there were sometimes small 
pieces of painted wood, bark, and other driftage. On the shore, with pebbles of 
granite, there were round or oval pieces of brick, which the waves had rolled 
about till they resembled a natural mineral. Huge stones tossed about, in every 
variety of confusion, some shagged all over with sea-weed, others only partly 
covered, others bare. The old ten-gun battery, at the outer angle of the 
Juniper, very verdant, and besprinkled with white-weed, clover, and buttercups. 
The juniper-trees are very aged and decayed and moss-grown. The grass about the 
hospital is rank, being trodden, probably, by nobody but myself. There is a 
representation of a vessel under sail, cut with a penknife, on the corner of 
the house.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Returning by the almshouse, I stopped a good while to look at the pigs,--a 
great herd,--who seemed to be just finishing their suppers. They certainly are 
types of unmitigated sensuality,--some standing in the trough, in the midst of 
their own and others' victuals,--some thrusting their noses deep into the 
food,--some rubbing their backs against a post,--some huddled together between 
sleeping and waking, breathing hard,--all wallowing about; a great boar 
swaggering round, and a big sow waddling along with her huge paunch. 
Notwithstanding the unspeakable defilement with which these strange sensualists 
spice all their food, they seem to have a quick and delicate sense of smell. 
What ridiculous-looking animals! Swift himself could not have imagined anything 
nastier than what they practise by the mere impulse of natural genius. Yet the 
Shakers keep their pigs very clean, and with great advantage. The legion of 
devils in the herd of swine,--what a scene it must have been!</p> 
<p>Sunday evening, going by the jail, the setting sun kindled up the windows 
most cheerfully; as if there were a bright, comfortable light within its 
darksome stone wall.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><em>June</em> 18<em>th.</em>--A walk in North Salem in the decline of 
yesterday afternoon,--beautiful weather, bright, sunny, with a western or 
northwestern wind just cool enough, and a slight superfluity of heat. The 
verdure, both of trees and grass, is now in its prime, the leaves elastic, all 
life. The grass-fields are plenteously bestrewn with white-weed, large spaces 
looking as white as a sheet of snow, at a distance, yet with an indescribably 
warmer tinge than snow,--living white,&nbsp;intermixed with living green. The 
hills and hollows beyond the Cold Spring copiously shaded, principally with 
oaks of good growth, and some walnut-trees, with the rich sun brightening in 
the midst of the open spaces, and mellowing and fading into the shade,--and 
single trees, with their cool spot of shade, in the waste of sun: quite a 
picture of beauty, gently picturesque. The surface of the land is so varied, 
with woodland mingled, that the eye cannot reach far away, except now and then 
in vistas perhaps across the river, showing houses, or a church and surrounding 
village, in Upper Beverly. In one of the sunny bits of pasture, walled 
irregularly in with oak-shade, I saw a gray mare feeding, and, as I drew near, 
a colt sprang up from amid the grass,--a very small colt. He looked me in the 
face, and I tried to startle him, so as to make him gallop; but he stretched 
his long legs, one after another, walked quietly to his mother, and began to 
suck,--just wetting his lips, not being very hungry. Then he rubbed his head, 
alternately, with each hind leg. He was a graceful little beast.</p> 
<p>I bathed in the cove, overhung with maples and walnuts, the water cool and 
thrilling. At a distance it sparkled bright and blue in the breeze and sun. 
There were jelly-fish swimming about, and several left to melt away on the 
shore. On the shore, sprouting amongst the sand and gravel, I found samphire, 
growing somewhat like asparagus. It is an excellent salad at this season, salt, 
yet with an herb-like vivacity, and very tender. I strolled slowly through the 
pastures, watching my long shadow making grave, fantastic gestures in the sun. 
It is a pretty sight to see the sunshine brightening the entrance of a road 
which shortly becomes deeply overshadowed by trees on both sides.&nbsp;At the 
Cold Spring, three little girls, from six to nine, were seated on the stones in 
which the fountain is set, and paddling in the water. It was a pretty picture, 
and would have been prettier, if they had shown bare little legs, instead of 
pantalets. Very large trees overhung them, and the sun was so nearly gone down 
that a pleasant gloom made the spot sombre, in contrast with these light and 
laughing little figures. On perceiving me, they rose up, tittering among 
themselves. It seemed that there was a sort of playful malice in those who 
first saw me; for they allowed the other to keep on paddling, without warning 
her of my approach. I passed along, and heard them come chattering behind.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><em>June</em> 22d.--I rode to Boston in the afternoon with Mr. Proctor. It 
was a coolish day, with clouds and intermitting sunshine, and a pretty fresh 
breeze. We stopped about an hour at the Maverick House, in the sprouting branch 
of the city, at East Boston,--a stylish house, with doors painted in imitation 
of oak; a large bar; bells ringing; the bar-keeper calls out, when a bell 
rings, &quot;Number --- &quot;; then a waiter replies, &quot;Number --- 
answered&quot;; and scampers up stairs. A ticket is given by the hostler, on 
taking the horse and chaise, which is returned to the bar-keeper when the 
chaise is wanted. The landlord was fashionably dressed, with the whitest of 
linen, neatly plaited, and as courteous as a Lord Chamberlain. Visitors from 
Boston thronging the house,--some standing at the bar, watching the process of 
preparing tumblers of punch,--others sitting at the windows of different 
parlors,--some with faces flushed, puffing cigars. The bill of fare for the day 
was stuck up beside the&nbsp;bar. Opposite this principal hotel there was 
another, called &quot;The Mechanics,&quot; which seemed to be equally thronged. 
I suspect that the company were about on a par in each; for at the Maverick 
House, though well dressed, they seemed to be merely Sunday gentlemen,--mostly 
young fellows,--clerks in dry-goods stores being the aristocracy of them. One, 
very fashionable in appearance, with a handsome cane, happened to stop by me 
and lift up his foot, and I noticed that the sole of his boot (which was 
exquisitely polished) was all worn out. I apprehend that some such minor 
deficiencies might have been detected in the general showiness of most of them. 
There were girls, too, but not pretty ones, nor, on the whole, such good 
imitations of gentility as the young men. There were as many people as are 
usually collected at a muster, or on similar occasions, lounging about, without 
any apparent enjoyment; but the observation of this may serve me to make a 
sketch of the mode of spending the Sabbath by the majority of unmarried, young, 
middling-class people, near a great town. Most of the people had smart canes 
and bosom-pins.</p> 
<p>Crossing the ferry into Boston, we went to the City Tavern, where the 
bar-room presented a Sabbath scene of repose,--stage-folk lounging in chairs 
half asleep, smoking cigars, generally with clean linen and other niceties of 
apparel, to mark the day. The doors and blinds of an oyster and refreshment 
shop across the street were closed, but I saw people enter it. There were two 
owls in a back court, visible through a window of the bar-room,--speckled gray, 
with dark-blue eyes,--the queerest-looking birds that exist,--so solemn and 
wise,--dozing away the day, much like the rest of the people, only that they 
looked wiser&nbsp;than any others. Their hooked beaks looked like hooked noses. 
A dull scene this. A stranger, here and there, poring over a newspaper. Many of 
the stage-folk sitting in chairs on the pavement, in front of the door.</p> 
<p>We went to the top of the hill which formed part of Gardiner Greene's 
estate, and which is now in the process of levelling, and pretty much taken 
away, except the highest point, and a narrow path to ascend to it. It gives an 
admirable view of the city, being almost as high as the steeples and the dome 
of the State House, and overlooking the whole mass of brick buildings and 
slated roofs, with glimpses of streets far below. It was really a pity to take 
it down. I noticed the stump of a very large elm, recently felled. No house in 
the city could have reared its roof so high as the roots of that tree, if 
indeed the church-spires did so.</p> 
<p>On our drive home we passed through Charlestown. Stages in abundance were 
passing the road, burdened with passengers inside and out; also chaises and 
barouches, horsemen and footmen. We are a community of Sabbath-breakers!</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><em>August</em> 31<em>st.</em>--A drive to Nahant yesterday afternoon. 
Stopped at Rice's, and afterwards walked down to the steamboat wharf to see the 
passengers land. It is strange how few good faces there are in the world, 
comparatively to the ugly ones. Scarcely a single comely one in all this 
collection. Then to the hotel. Barouches at the doors, and gentlemen and ladies 
going to drive, and gentlemen smoking round the piazza. The bar-keeper had one 
of Benton's mint-drops for a bosom-brooch! It made a very handsome one. I 
crossed the beach for home about sunset. The tide&nbsp;was so far down as just 
to give me a passage on the hard sand, between the sea and the loose gravel. 
The sea was calm and smooth, with only the surf-waves whitening along the 
beach. Several ladies and gentlemen on horseback were cantering and galloping 
before and behind me.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>A hint of a story,--some incident which should bring on a general war; and 
the chief actor in the incident to have something corresponding to the mischief 
he had caused.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><em>September</em> 7<em>th.</em>--A drive to Ipswich with B----. At the 
tavern was an old, fat, country major, and another old fellow, laughing and 
playing off jokes on each other,--one tying a ribbon upon the other's hat. One 
had been a trumpeter to the major's troop. Walking about town, we knocked, for 
a whim, at the door of a dark old house, and inquired if Miss Hannah Lord lived 
there. A woman of about thirty came to the door, with rather a confused smile, 
and a disorder about the bosom of her dress, as if she had been disturbed while 
nursing her child. She answered us with great kindness.</p> 
<p>Entering the burial-ground, where some masons were building a tomb, we 
found a good many old monuments, and several covered with slabs of red 
freestone or slate, and with arms sculptured on the slab, or an inlaid circle 
of slate. On one slate gravestone, of the Rev. Nathl. Rogers, there was a 
portrait of that worthy, about a third of the size of life, carved in relief, 
with his cloak, band, and wig, in excellent preservation, all the buttons of 
his waistcoat being cut with great minuteness,--the minister's nose being on
&nbsp;a level with his cheeks. It was an upright gravestone. Returning home, I 
held a colloquy with a young girl about the right road. She had come out to 
feed a pig, and was a little suspicious that we were making fun of her, yet 
answered us with a shy laugh and good-nature,--the pig all the time squealing 
for his dinner.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Displayed along the walls, and suspended from the pillars of the original 
King's Chapel, were coats of arms of the king, the successive governors, and 
other distinguished men. In the pulpit there was an hour-glass on a large and 
elaborate brass stand. The organ was surmounted by a gilt crown in the centre, 
supported by a gilt mitre on each side. The governor's pew had Corinthian 
pillars, and crimson damask tapestry. In 1727 it was lined with china, probably 
tiles.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Saint Augustin, at mass, charged all that were accursed to go out of the 
church. &quot;Then a dead body arose, and went out of the church into the 
churchyard, with a white cloth on its head, and stood there till mass was over. 
It was a former lord of the manor, whom a curate had cursed because he refused 
to pay his tithes. A justice also commanded the dead curate to arise, and gave 
him a rod; and the dead lord, kneeling, received penance thereby.&quot; He then 
ordered the lord to go again to his grave, which he did, and fell immediately 
to ashes. Saint Augustin offered to pray for the curate, that he might remain 
on earth to confirm men in their belief; but the curate refused, because he was 
in the place of rest.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>A sketch to be given of a modern reformer,--a&nbsp;type of the extreme 
doctrines on the subject of slaves, cold water, and other such topics. He goes 
about the streets haranguing most eloquently, and is on the point of making 
many converts, when his labors are suddenly interrupted by the appearance of 
the keeper of a mad-house, whence he has escaped. Much may be made of this idea.
</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>A change from a gay young girl to an old woman; the melancholy events, the 
effects of which have clustered around her character, and gradually imbued it 
with their influence, till she becomes a lover of sick-chambers, taking 
pleasure in receiving dying breaths and in laying out the dead; also having her 
mind full of funeral reminiscences, and possessing more acquaintances beneath 
the burial turf than above it.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>A well-concerted train of events to be thrown into confusion by some 
misplaced circumstance, unsuspected till the catastrophe, yet exerting its 
influence from beginning to end.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>On the common, at dusk, after a salute from two field-pieces, the smoke lay 
long and heavily on the ground, without much spreading beyond the original 
space over which it had gushed from the guns. It was about the height of a man. 
The evening clear, but with an autumnal chill.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The world is so sad and solemn, that things meant in jest are liable, by an 
overpowering influence, to become dreadful earnest,--gayly dressed fantasies 
turning to ghostly and black-clad images of themselves.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>A story, the hero of which is to be represented as naturally capable of 
deep and strong passion, and looking forward to the time when he shall feel 
passionate love, which is to be the great event of his existence. But it so 
chances that he never falls in love, and although he gives up the expectation 
of so doing, and marries calmly, yet it is somewhat sadly, with sentiments 
merely of esteem for his bride. The lady might be one who had loved him early 
in life, but whom then, in his expectation of passionate love, he had scorned.
</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The scene of a story or sketch to be laid within the light of a 
street-lantern; the time, when the lamp is near going out; and the catastrophe 
to be simultaneous with the last flickering gleam.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The peculiar weariness and depression of spirits which is felt after a day 
wasted in turning over a magazine or other light miscellany, different from the 
state of the mind after severe study; because there has been no excitement, no 
difficulties to be overcome, but the spirits have evaporated insensibly.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>To represent the process by which sober truth gradually strips off all the 
beautiful draperies with which imagination has enveloped a beloved object, till 
from an angel she turns out to be a merely ordinary woman. This to be done 
without caricature, perhaps with a quiet humor interfused, but the prevailing 
impression to be a sad one. The story might consist of the various alterations 
in the feelings of the absent lover, caused by successive events that display 
the true character of his mistress; and the catastrophe should take&nbsp;place 
at their meeting, when he finds himself equally disappointed in her person; or 
the whole spirit of the thing may here be reproduced.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Last evening, from the opposite shore of the North River, a view of the 
town mirrored in the water, which was as smooth as glass, with no perceptible 
tide or agitation, except a trifling swell and reflux on the sand, although the 
shadow of the moon danced in it. The picture of the town perfect in the 
water,--towers of churches, houses, with here and there a light gleaming near 
the shore above, and more faintly glimmering under water,--all perfect, but 
somewhat more hazy and indistinct than the reality. There were many clouds 
flitting about the sky; and the picture of each could be traced in the 
water,--the ghost of what was itself unsubstantial. The rattling of wheels 
heard long and far through the town. Voices of people talking on the other side 
of the river, the tones being so distinguishable in all their variations that 
it seemed as if what was there said might be understood; but it was not so.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Two persons might be bitter enemies through life, and mutually cause the 
ruin of one another, and of all that were dear to them. Finally, meeting at the 
funeral of a grandchild, the offspring of a son and daughter married without 
their consent,--and who, as well as the child, had been the victims of their 
hatred,--they might discover that the supposed ground of the quarrel was 
altogether a mistake, and then be wofully reconciled.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Two persons, by mutual agreement, to make their&nbsp;wills in each other's 
favor, then to wait impatiently for one another's death, and both to be 
informed of the desired event at the same time. Both, in most joyous sorrow, 
hasten to be present at the funeral, meet, and find themselves both hoaxed.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The story of a man, cold and hard-hearted, and acknowledging no brotherhood 
with mankind. At his death they might try to dig him a grave, but, at a little 
space beneath the ground, strike upon a rock, as if the earth refused to 
receive the unnatural son into her bosom. Then they would put him into an old 
sepulchre, where the coffins and corpses were all turned to dust, and so he 
would be alone. Then the body would petrify; and he having died in some 
characteristic act and expression, he would seem, through endless ages of 
death, to repel society as in life, and no one would be buried in that tomb 
forever.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Cannon transformed to church-bells.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>A person, even before middle age, may become musty and faded among the 
people with whom he has grown up from childhood; but, by migrating to a new 
place, he appears fresh with the effect of youth, which may be communicated 
from the impressions of others to his own feelings.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>In an old house, a mysterious knocking might be heard on the wall, where 
had formerly been a door-way, now bricked up.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>It might be stated, as the closing circumstance of a tale, that the body of 
one of the characters had been petrified, and still existed in that state.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>A young man to win the love of a girl, without any serious intentions, and 
to find that in that love, which might have been the greatest blessing of his 
life, he had conjured up a spirit of mischief which pursued him throughout his 
whole career,--and this without any revengeful purposes on the part of the 
deserted girl.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Two lovers, or other persons, on the most private business, to appoint a 
meeting in what they supposed to be a place of the utmost solitude, and to find 
it thronged with people.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><em>October</em> 17<em>th.</em>--Some of the oaks are now a deep brown red; 
others are changed to a light green, which, at a little distance, especially in 
the sunshine, looks like the green of early spring. In some trees, different 
masses of the foliage show each of these hues. Some of the walnut-trees have a 
yet more delicate green. Others are of a bright sunny yellow.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Mr.---- was married to Miss ---- last Wednesday. Yesterday Mr. Brazer, 
preaching on the comet, observed that not one, probably, of all who heard him, 
would witness its reappearance. Mrs.---- shed tears. Poor soul! she would be 
contented to dwell in earthly love to all eternity!</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Some treasure or other thing to be buried, and a tree planted directly over 
the spot, so as to embrace it with its roots.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>A tree, tall and venerable, to be said by tradition to have been the staff 
of some famous man, who happened to thrust it into the ground, where it took 
root.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>A fellow without money, having a hundred and seventy miles to go, fastened 
a chain and padlock to his legs, and lay down to sleep in a field. He was 
apprehended, and carried gratis to a jail in the town whither he desired to go.
</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>An old volume in a large library,--every one to be afraid to unclasp and 
open it, because it was said to be a book of magic.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>A ghost seen by moonlight; when the moon was out, it would shine and melt 
through the airy substance of the ghost, as through a cloud.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Prideaux, Bishop of Worcester, during the sway of the Parliament, was 
forced to support himself and his family by selling his household goods. A 
friend asked him, &quot;How doth your lordship?&quot; &quot;Never better in my 
life,&quot; said the Bishop, &quot;only I have too great a stomach; for I have 
eaten that little plate which the sequestrators left me. I have eaten a great 
library of excellent books. I have eaten a great deal of linen, much of my 
brass, some of my pewter, and now I am come to eat iron; and what will come 
next I know not.&quot;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>A scold and a blockhead,--brimstone and wood,--a good match.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>To make one's own reflection in a mirror the subject of a story.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>In a dream to wander to some place where may be heard the complaints of all 
the miserable on earth.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Some common quality or circumstance that should bring together people the 
most unlike in all other respects, and make a brotherhood and sisterhood of 
them,--the rich and the proud finding themselves in the same category with the 
mean and the despised.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>A person to consider himself as the prime mover of certain remarkable 
events, but to discover that his actions have not contributed in the least 
thereto. Another person to be the cause, without suspecting it.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><em>October</em> 25<em>th.</em>--A person or family long desires some 
particular good. At last it comes in such profusion as to be the great pest of 
their lives.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>A man, perhaps with a persuasion that he shall make his fortune by some 
singular means, and with an eager longing so to do, while digging or boring for 
water, to strike upon a salt-spring.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>To have one event operate in several places,--as, for example, if a man's 
head were to be cut off in one town, men's heads to drop off in several towns.
</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Follow out the fantasy of a man taking his life by instalments, instead of 
at one payment,--say ten years of life alternately with ten years of suspended 
animation.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Sentiments in a foreign language, which merely convey the sentiment without 
retaining to the reader any graces of style or harmony of sound, have somewhat 
of the charm of thoughts in one's own mind that have not yet been put into 
words. No possible words that&nbsp;we might adapt to them could realize the 
unshaped beauty that they appear to possess. This is the reason that 
translations are never satisfactory,--and less so, I should think, to one who 
cannot than to one who can pronounce the language.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>A person to be writing a tale, and to find that it shapes itself against 
his intentions; that the characters act otherwise than he thought; that 
unforeseen events occur; and a catastrophe comes which he strives in vain to 
avert. It might shadow forth his own fate,--he having made himself one of the 
personages.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>It is a singular thing, that, at the distance, say, of five feet, the work 
of the greatest dunce looks just as well as that of the greatest genius,--that 
little space being all the distance between genius and stupidity.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Mrs. Sigourney says, after Coleridge, that &quot;poetry has been its own 
exceeding great reward.&quot; For the writing, perhaps; but would it be so for 
the reading?</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Four precepts: To break off customs; to shake off spirits ill-disposed; to 
meditate on youth; to do nothing against one's genius.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<h3>[1836]</h3> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><em>Salem, August</em> 31, 1836.--A walk, yesterday, down to the shore, 
near the hospital. Standing on the old grassy battery, that forms a semicircle, 
and looking seaward. The sun not a great way above the horizon, yet so far as 
to give a very golden brightness, when it shone out. Clouds in the vicinity of 
the sun, and nearly all the rest of the sky covered with clouds&nbsp;in masses, 
not a gray uniformity of cloud. A fresh breeze blowing from land seaward. If it 
had been blowing from the sea, it would have raised it in heavy billows, and 
caused it to dash high against the rocks. But now its surface was not all 
commoved with billows; there was only roughness enough to take off the gleam, 
and give it the aspect of iron after cooling. The clouds above added to the 
black appearance. A few sea-birds were flitting over the water, only visible at 
moments, when they turned their white bosoms towards me,--as if they were then 
first created. The sunshine had a singular effect. The clouds would interpose 
in such a manner that some objects were shaded from it, while others were 
strongly illuminated. Some of the islands lay in the shade, dark and gloomy, 
while others were bright and favored spots. The white light-house was sometimes 
very cheerfully marked. There was a schooner about a mile from the shore, at 
anchor, laden apparently with lumber. The sea all about her had the black, iron 
aspect which I have described; but the vessel herself was alight. Hull, masts, 
and spars were all gilded, and the rigging was made of golden threads. A small 
white streak of foam breaking around the bows, which ware towards the wind. The 
shadowiness of the clouds overhead made the effect of the sunlight strange, 
where it fell.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><em>September.</em>--The elm-trees have golden branches intermingled with 
their green already, and so they had on the first of the month.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>To picture the predicament of worldly people, if admitted to paradise.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>As the architecture of a country always follows the earliest structures, 
American architecture should be a refinement of the log-house. The Egyptian is 
so of the cavern and mound; the Chinese, of the tent; the Gothic, of 
overarching trees; the Greek, of a cabin.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&quot;Though we speak nonsense, God will pick out the meaning of it,&quot;
--an extempore prayer by a New England divine.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>In old times it must have been much less customary than now to drink pure 
water. Walker emphatically mentions, among the sufferings of a clergyman's wife 
and family in the Great Rebellion, that they were forced to drink water, with 
crab-apples stamped in it to relish it.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Mr. Kirby, author of a work on the History, Habits, and Instincts of 
Animals, questions whether there may not be an abyss of waters within the 
globe, communicating with the ocean, and whether the huge animals of the 
Saurian tribe--great reptiles, supposed to be exclusively antediluvian, and now 
extinct--may not be inhabitants of it. He quotes a passage from Revelation, 
where the creatures under the earth are spoken of as distinct from those of the 
sea, and speaks of a Saurian fossil that has been found deep in the 
subterranean regions. He thinks, or suggests, that these may be the dragons of 
Scripture.</p>

<p>It is said of the eagle, that, in however long a flight, he is never seen 
to clap his wings to his sides. He seems to govern his movements by the 
inclination of his wings and tail to the wind, as a ship is propelled by the 
action of the wind on her sails.</p>

<p>In old country-houses in England, instead of glass for windows, they used 
wicker, or fine strips of oak disposed checkerwise. Horn was also used. The 
windows of princes and great noblemen were of crystal; those of Studley Castle, 
Holinshed says, of beryl. There were seldom chimneys; and they cooked their 
meats by a fire made against an iron back in the great hall. Houses, often of 
gentry, were built of a heavy timber frame, filled up with lath and plaster. 
People slept on rough mats or straw pallets, with a round log for a pillow; 
seldom better beds than a mattress, with a sack of chaff for a pillow.</p>

<p><em>October</em> 25<em>th.</em>--A walk yesterday through Dark Lane, and 
home through the village of Danvers. Landscape now wholly autumnal. Saw an 
elderly man laden with two dry, yellow, rustling bundles of Indian 
corn-stalks,--a good personification of Autumn. Another man hoeing up potatoes. 
Rows of white cabbages lay ripening. Fields of dry Indian corn. The grass has 
still considerable greenness. Wild rose-bushes devoid of leaves, with their 
deep, bright red seed-vessels. Meeting-house in Danvers seen at a distance, 
with the sun shining through the windows of its belfry.&nbsp;
Barberry-bushes,--the leaves now of a brown red, still juicy and healthy; very 
few berries remaining, mostly frost-bitten and wilted. All among the yet green 
grass, dry stalks of weeds. The down of thistles occasionally seen flying 
through the sunny air.</p>

<p>A Thanksgiving dinner. All the miserable on earth are to be invited,--as 
the drunkard, the bereaved parent, the ruined merchant, the broken-hearted 
lover, the poor widow, the old man and woman who have outlived their 
generation, the disappointed author, the wounded, sick, and broken soldier, the 
diseased person, the infidel, the man with an evil conscience, little orphan 
children or children of neglectful parents, shall be admitted to the table, and 
many others. The giver of the feast goes out to deliver his invitations. Some 
of the guests he meets in the streets, some he knocks for at the doors of their 
houses. The description&nbsp;must be rapid. But who must be the giver of the 
feast, and what his claims to preside? A man who has never found out what he is 
fit for, who has unsettled aims or objects in life, and whose mind gnaws him, 
making him the sufferer of many kinds of misery. He should meet some pious, 
old, sorrowful person, with more outward calamities than any other, and invite 
him, with a reflection that piety would make all that miserable company truly 
thankful.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>A new classification of society to be instituted.&nbsp;Instead of rich and 
poor, high and low, they are to be classed,--First, by their sorrows: for 
instance, whenever there are any, whether in fair mansion or hovel, who are 
mourning the loss of relations and friends, and who wear black, whether the 
cloth be coarse or superfine, they are to make one class. Secondly, all who 
have the same maladies, whether they lie under damask canopies or on straw 
pallets or in the wards of hospitals, they are to form one class. Thirdly, all 
who are guilty of the same sins, whether the world knows them or not; whether 
they languish in prison, looking forward to the gallows, or walk honored among 
men, they also form a class. Then proceed to generalize and classify the whole 
world together, as none can claim utter exemption from either sorrow, sin, or 
disease; and if they could, yet Death, like a great parent, comes and sweeps 
them all through one darksome portal,--all his children.</p>

<p>Fortune to come like a pedlar with his goods,--as wreaths of laurel,

<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Curious to imagine what murmurings and discontent would be excited, if any 
of the great so-called calamities of human beings were to be abolished,--as, 
for instance, death.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Trifles to one are matters of life and death to another. As, for instance,

<p>Would it not be wiser for people to rejoice at all that they now sorrow 
for, andvice versa? To put on bridal garments at funerals, and mourning at 
weddings? For their friends to condole with them when they attained riches and 
honor, as only so much care added?</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>If in a village it were a custom to hang a funeral garland or other token 
of death on a house where some one had died, and there to let it remain till a 
death occurred elsewhere, and then to hang that same garland over the other 
house, it would have, methinks, a strong effect.</p>

<p>Two lovers to plan the building of a pleasure-house on a certain spot of 
ground, but various seeming accidents prevent it. Once they find a group of 
miserable children there; once it is the scene where crime is plotted; at last 
the dead body of one of the lovers or of a dear friend is found there; and, 
instead of a pleasure-house, they build a marble tomb. The moral,--that there 
is no place on earth fit for the site of a&nbsp;pleasure-house, because there 
is no spot that may not have been saddened by human grief, stained by crime, or 
hallowed by death. It might be three friends who plan it, instead of two 
lovers; and the dearest one dies.</p>

<p>A man to flatter himself with the idea that he would not be guilty of some

blood, and to commit murder. This appetite may be traced in the popularity of 
criminal trials. The appetite might be observed first in a child, and then 
traced upwards, manifesting itself in crimes suited to every stage of life.</p>

men in Europe,--the Prince of Wales, afterwards George IV., being the other. 
Some authorities, however, have represented him as ungainly in person and rough 
in manners. Tarleton was originally bred for the law, but quitted law for the 
army early in life. He was son to a mayor of Liverpool, born in 1754, of 
ancient family. He wrote his own memoirs after returning from America. 
Afterwards in Parliament. Never afterwards distinguished in arms. Created 
baronet in 1818, and died childless in 1833. Thought he was not sufficiently 
honored among more modern heroes. Lost part of his right hand in battle of 
Guilford Court House. A man of pleasure in England.</p>

<h3>[1837]</h3> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><em>Maine</em>, <em>July</em> 5, 1837.--Here I am, settled since night 
before last with B----, and living very singularly. He leads a bachelor's life 
in his paternal mansion, only a small part of which is occupied by a family who 
serve him. He provides his own breakfast and supper, and occasionally his 
dinner; though this is oftener, I believe, taken at a hotel, or an 
eating-house, or with some of his relatives. I am his guest, and my presence 
makes no alteration in his way of life. Our fare, thus far, has consisted of 
bread, butter, and cheese, crackers, herrings, boiled eggs, coffee, milk, and 
claret wine. He has another inmate, in the person of a queer little Frenchman, 
who has his breakfast, tea, and lodging here, and finds his dinner elsewhere. 
Monsieur S---- does not appear to be more than twenty-one years old,--a 
diminutive figure, with eyes askew, and otherwise of an ungainly physiognomy; 
he is ill-dressed also, in a coarse blue coat, thin cotton pantaloons, and 
unbrushed boots; altogether with as little of French coxcombry as can well be 
imagined, though with something of the monkey aspect inseparable from a little 
Frenchman. He is, nevertheless, an intelligent and well-informed man, 
apparently of extensive reading in his own language,--a philosopher, B---- 
tells me, and an infidel. His insignificant personal appearance stands in the 
way of his success, and prevents him from receiving the respect which is really 
due to his talents and acquirements, wherefore he is bitterly dissatisfied with 
the country and its&nbsp;inhabitants, and often expresses his feelings to B---- 
(who has gained his confidence to a certain degree) in very strong terms.</p> 
<p>Thus here are three characters, each with something out of the common way, 
living together somewhat like monks. B----, our host, combines more high and 
admirable qualities, of that sort which make up a gentleman, than any other 
that I have met with. Polished, yet natural, frank, open, and straightforward, 
yet with a delicate feeling for the sensitiveness of his companions; of 
excellent temper and warm heart; well acquainted with the world, with a keen 
faculty of observation, which he has had many opportunities of exercising, and 
never varying from a code of honor and principle which is really nice and rigid 
in its way. There is a sort of philosophy developing itself in him which will 
not impossibly cause him to settle down in this or some other equally singular 
course of life. He seems almost to have made up his mind never to be married, 
which I wonder at; for he has strong affections, and is fond both of women and 
children.</p> 
<p>The little Frenchman impresses me very strongly, too,--so lonely as he is 
here, struggling against the world, with bitter feelings in his breast, and yet 
talking with the vivacity and gayety of his nation; making this his home from 
darkness to daylight, and enjoying here what little domestic comfort and 
confidence there is for him; and then going about the live-long day, teaching 
French to blockheads who sneer at him, and returning at about ten o'clock in 
the evening (for I was wrong in saying he supped here,--he eats no supper) to 
his solitary room and bed. Before retiring, he goes to B----'s bedside, and, if 
he finds him awake, stands talking French, expressing his dislike of&nbsp;the 
Americans,--&quot;Je hais, je hais les Yankees!&quot;--thus giving vent to the 
stifled bitterness of the whole day. In the morning I hear him getting up 
early, at sunrise or before, humming to himself, scuffling about his chamber 
with his thick boots, and at last taking his departure for a solitary ramble 
till breakfast. Then he comes in, cheerful and vivacious enough, eats pretty 
heartily, and is off again, singing Frenchchansons as he goes down the 
gravel-walk. The poor fellow has nobody to sympathize with him but B----, and 
thus a singular connection is established between two utterly different 
characters.</p> 
<p>Then here is myself, who am likewise a queer character in my way, and have 
come to spend a week or two with my friend of half a lifetime,--the longest 
space, probably, that we are ever destined to spend together; for Fate seems 
preparing changes for both of us. My circumstances, at least, cannot long 
continue as they are and have been; and B----, too, stands between high 
prosperity and utter ruin.</p> 
<p>I think I should soon become strongly attached to our way of life, so 
independent and untroubled by the forms and restrictions of society. The house 
is very pleasantly situated,--half a mile distant from where the town begins to 
be thickly settled, and on a swell of land, with the road running at a distance 
of fifty yards, and a grassy tract and a gravel-walk between. Beyond the road 
rolls the Kennebec, here two or three hundred yards wide. Putting my head out 
of the window, I can see it flowing steadily along straightway between wooded 
banks; but arriving nearly opposite the house, there is a large and level sand 
island in the middle of the stream; and just below the island the current is 
further interrupted by the works of the&nbsp;mill-dam, which is perhaps half 
finished, yet still in so rude a state that it looks as much like the ruins of 
a dam destroyed by the spring freshets as like the foundations of a dam yet to 
be. Irishmen and Canadians toil at work on it, and the echoes of their 
hammering and of the voices come across the river and up to this window. Then 
there is a sound of the wind among the trees round the house; and, when that is 
silent, the calm, full, distant voice of the river becomes audible. Looking 
downward thither, I see the rush of the current, and mark the different eddies, 
with here and there white specks or streaks of foam; and often a log comes 
floating on, glistening in the sun, as it rolls over among the eddies, having 
voyaged, for aught I know, hundreds of miles from the wild upper sources of the 
river, passing down, down, between lines of forest, and sometimes a rough 
clearing, till here it floats by cultivated banks, and will soon pass by the 
village. Sometimes a long raft of boards comes along, requiring the nicest 
skill in navigating it through the narrow passage left by the mill-dam. Chaises 
and wagons occasionally go over the road, the riders all giving a passing 
glance at the dam, or perhaps alighting to examine it more fully, and at last 
departing with ominous shakes of the head as to the result of the enterprise. 
My position is so far retired from the river and mill-dam, that, though the 
latter is really rather a scene, yet a sort of quiet seems to be diffused over 
the whole. Two or three times a day this quiet is broken by the sudden thunder 
from a quarry, where the workmen are blasting rocks; and a peal of thunder 
sounds strangely in such a green, sunny, and quiet landscape, with the blue sky 
brightening the river.</p> 
<p>I have not seen much of the people. There have&nbsp;been, however, several 
incidents which amused me, though scarcely worth telling. A passionate 
tavern-keeper, quick as a flash of gunpowder, a nervous man, and showing in his 
demeanor, it seems, a consciousness of his infirmity of temper. I was a witness 
of a scuffle of his with a drunken guest. The tavern-keeper, after they were 
separated, raved like a madman, and in a tone of voice having a drolly pathetic 
or lamentable sound mingled with its rage, as if he were lifting up his voice 
to weep. Then he jumped into a chaise which was standing by, whipped up the 
horse, and drove off rapidly, as if to give his fury vent in that way.</p> 
<p>On the morning of the Fourth of July, two printer's apprentice-lads, nearly 
grown, dressed in jackets and very tight pantaloons of check, tight as their 
skins, so that they looked like harlequins or circus-clowns, yet appeared to 
think themselves in perfect propriety, with a very calm and quiet assurance of 
the admiration of the town. A common fellow, a carpenter, who, on the strength 
of political partisanship, asked B----'s assistance in cutting out great 
letters from play-bills in order to print &quot;Martin Van Buren Forever&quot; 
on a flag; but B---- refused. B---- seems to be considerably of a favorite with 
the lower orders, especially with the Irishmen and French Canadians,--the 
latter accosting him in the street, and asking his assistance as an interpreter 
in making their bargains for work.</p> 
<p>I meant to dine at the hotel with B---- to-day; but having returned to the 
house, leaving him to do some business in the village, I found myself unwilling 
to move when the dinner-hour approached, and therefore dined very well on 
bread, cheese, and eggs. Nothin&nbsp;of much interest takes place. We live very 
comfortably in our bachelor establishment on a cold shoulder of mutton, with 
ham and smoked beef and boiled eggs; and as to drinkables, we had both claret 
and brown sherry on the dinner-table to-day. Last evening we had a long 
literary and philosophical conversation with Monsieur S----. He is rather 
remarkably well-informed for a man of his age, and seems to have very just 
notions on ethics, etc., though damnably perverted as to religion. It is 
strange to hear philosophy of any sort from such a boyish figure. &quot;We 
philosophers,&quot; he is fond of saying, to distinguish himself and his 
brethren from the Christians. One of his oddities is, that, while steadfastly 
maintaining an opinion that he is a very small and slow eater, and that we, in 
common with other Yankees, eat immensely and fast, he actually eats both faster 
and longer than we do, and devours, as B---- avers, more victuals than both of 
us together.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><em>Saturday</em>, <em>July</em> 8<em>th.</em>--Yesterday afternoon, a 
stroll with B---- up a large brook, he fishing for trout, and I looking on. The 
brook runs through a valley, on one side bordered by a high and precipitous 
bank; on the other there is an interval, and then the bank rises upward and 
upward into a high hill, with gorges and ravines separating one summit from 
another, and here and there are bare places, where the rain-streams have washed 
away the grass. The brook is bestrewn with stones, some bare, some partially 
moss-grown, and sometimes so huge as--once at least--to occupy almost the whole 
breadth of the current. Amongst these the stream brawls, only that this word 
does not express its good-natured voice, and &quot;murmur&quot; is too&nbsp;
quiet. It sings along, sometimes smooth, with the pebbles visible beneath, 
sometimes rushing dark and swift, eddying and whitening past some rock, or 
underneath the hither or the farther bank; and at these places B---- cast his 
line, and sometimes drew out a trout, small, not more than five or six inches 
long. The farther we went up the brook, the wilder it grew. The opposite bank 
was covered with pines and hemlocks, ascending high upwards, black and solemn. 
One knew that there must be almost a precipice behind, yet we could not see it. 
At the foot you could spy, a little way within the darksome shade, the roots 
and branches of the trees; but soon all sight was obstructed amidst the trunks. 
On the hither side, at first the bank was bare, then fringed with alder-bushes, 
bending and dipping into the stream, which, farther on, flowed through the 
midst of a forest of maple, beech, and other trees, its course growing wilder 
and wilder as we proceeded. For a considerable distance there was a causeway, 
built long ago of logs, to drag lumber upon; it was now decayed and rotten, a 
red decay, sometimes sunken down in the midst, here and there a knotty trunk 
stretching across, apparently sound. The sun being now low towards the west, a 
pleasant gloom and brightness were diffused through the forest, spots of 
brightness scattered upon the branches, or thrown down in gold upon the last 
year's leaves among the trees. At last we came to where a dam had been built 
across the many years ago, and was now gone to ruin, so as to make the spot 
look more solitary and wilder than if man had never left vestiges of his toil 
there. It was a framework of logs, with a covering of plank sufficient to 
obstruct the onward flow of the brook; but it found its way past&nbsp;the side, 
and came foaming and struggling along among scattered rocks. Above the dam 
there was a broad and deep pool, one side of which was bordered by a 
precipitous wall of rocks, as smooth as if hewn out and squared, and piled one 
upon another, above which rose the forest. On the other side there was still a 
gently shelving bank, and the shore was covered with tall trees, among which I 
particularly remarked a stately pine, wholly devoid of bark, rising white in 
aged and majestic ruin, thrusting out its barkless arms. It must have stood 
there in death many years, its own ghost. Above the dam the brook flowed 
through the forest, a glistening and babbling water-path, illuminated by the 
sun, which sent its rays almost straight along its course. It was as lovely and 
wild and peaceful as it could possibly have been a hundred years ago; and the 
traces of labors of men long departed added a deeper peace to it. I bathed in 
the pool, and then pursued my way down beside the brook, growing dark with a 
pleasant gloom, as the sun sank and the water became more shadowy. B---- says 
that there was formerly a tradition that the Indians used to go up this brook, 
and return, after a brief absence, with large masses of lead, which they sold 
at the trading-stations in Augusta; whence there has always been an idea that 
there is a lead-mine hereabouts. Great toadstools were under the trees, and 
some small ones as yellow and almost the size of a half-broiled yolk of an egg. 
Strawberries were scattered along the brookside.</p> 
<p>Dined at the hotel or Mansion House to-day. Men were playing checkers in 
the parlor. The Marshal of Maine, a corpulent, jolly fellow, famed for humor. A 
passenger left by the stage, hiring an express onward. A bottle of champagne 
was quaffed at the bar.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><em>July</em> 9<em>th.</em>--Went with B---- to pay a visit to the shanties 
of the Irish and Canadians. He says that they sell and exchange these small 
houses among themselves continually. They may be built in three or four days, 
and are valued at four or five dollars. When the turf that is piled against the 
walls of some of them becomes covered with grass, it makes quite a picturesque 
object. It was almost dusk--just candle-lighting time--when we visited them. A 
young Frenchwoman, with a baby in her arms, came to the door of one of them, 
smiling, and looking pretty and happy. Her husband, a dark, black-haired, 
lively little fellow, caressed the child, laughing and singing to it; and there 
was a red-bearded Irishman, who likewise fondled the little brat. Then we could 
hear them within the hut, gabbling merrily, and could see them moving about 
briskly in the candlelight, through the window and open door. An old Irishwoman 
sat in the door of another hut, under the influence of an extra dose of 
rum,--she being an old lady of somewhat dissipated habits. She called to B----, 
and began to talk to him about her resolution not to give up her house: for it 
is his design to get her out of it. She is a true virago, and, though somewhat 
restrained by respect for him, she evinced a sturdy design to remain here 
through the winter, or at least for a considerable time longer. He persisting, 
she took her stand in the doorway of the hut, and stretched out her fist in a 
very Amazonian attitude. &quot;Nobody,&quot; quoth she, &quot;shall drive me 
out of this house, till my praties are out of the ground.&quot; Then would she 
wheedle and laugh and blarney, beginning in a rage, and ending as if she had 
been in jest. Meanwhile her husband stood by very quiet, occasionally trying to 
still her; but it&nbsp;is to be presumed, that, after our departure, they came 
to blows, it being a custom with the Irish husbands and wives to settle their 
disputes with blows; and it is said the woman often proves the better man. The 
different families also have battles, and occasionally the Irish fight with the 
Canadians. The latter, however, are much the more peaceable, never quarrelling 
among themselves, and seldom with their neighbors. They are frugal, and often 
go back to Canada with considerable sums of money. B---- has gained much 
influence both with the Irish and the French,--with the latter, by dint of 
speaking to them in their own language. He is the umpire in their disputes, and 
their adviser, and they look up to him as a protector and patron-friend. I have 
been struck to see with what careful integrity and wisdom he manages matters 
among them, hitherto having known him only as a free and gay young man. He 
appears perfectly to understand their general character, of which he gives no 
very flattering description. In these huts, less than twenty feet square, he 
tells me that upwards of twenty people have sometimes been lodged.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>A description of a young lady who had formerly been insane, and now felt 
the approach of a new fit of madness. She had been out to ride, had exerted 
herself much, and had been very vivacious. On her return, she sat down in a 
thoughtful and despondent attitude, looking very sad, but one of the loveliest 
objects that ever were seen. The family spoke to her, but she made no answer, 
nor took the least notice; but still sat like a statue in her chair,--a statue 
of melancholy and beauty. At last they led her away to her chamber.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>We went to meeting this forenoon. I saw nothing remarkable, unless a little 
girl in the next pew to us, three or four years old, who fell asleep, with her 
head in the lap of her maid, and looked very pretty: a picture of sleeping 
innocence.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><em>July</em> 11<em>th,</em> <em>Tuesday.</em>--A drive with B---- to 
Hallowell, yesterday, where we dined, and afterwards to Gardiner. The most 
curious object in this latter place was the elegant new mansion of ----. It 
stands on the site of his former dwelling, which was destroyed by fire. The new 
building was estimated to cost about thirty thousand dollars; but twice as much 
has already been expended, and a great deal more will be required to complete 
it. It is certainly a splendid structure; the material, granite from the 
vicinity. At the angles it has small, circular towers; the portal is lofty and 
imposing. Relatively to the general style of domestic architecture in our 
country, it well deserves the name of castle or palace. Its situation, too, is 
fine, far retired from the public road, and attainable by a winding 
carriage-drive; standing amid fertile fields, and with large trees in the 
vicinity. There is also a beautiful view from the mansion, adown the Kennebec.
</p> 
<p>Beneath some of the large trees we saw the remains of circular seats, 
whereupon the family used to sit before the former house was burned down. There 
was no one now in the vicinity of the place, save a man a yoke of oxen; and 
what he was about, I did not ascertain. Mr. ---- at present resides in a small 
dwelling, little more than a cottage, beside the main road, not far from the 
gateway which gives access to his palace.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>At Gardiner, on the wharf, I witnessed the starting of the steamboat New 
England for Boston. There was quite a collection of people, looking on or 
taking leave of passengers,--the steam puffing,--stages arriving, 
full-freighted with ladies and gentlemen. A man was one moment too late; but 
running along the gunwale of a mud-scow, and jumping into a skiff, he was put 
on board by a black fellow. The dark cabin, wherein, descending from the 
sunshiny deck, it was difficult to discern the furniture, looking-glasses, and 
mahogany wainscoting. I met two old college acquaintances,--O----, who was 
going to Boston, and B----, with whom we afterwards drank a glass of wine at 
the hotel.</p> 
<p>B----, Mons. S---- , and myself continue to live in the same style as 
heretofore. We appear mutually to be very well pleased with each other. Mons. 
S-- displays many comical qualities, and manages to insure us several hearty 
laughs every morning and evening,--those being the seasons when we meet. I am 
going to take lessons from him in the pronunciation of French. Of female 
society I see nothing. The only petticoat that comes within our premises 
appertains to Nancy, the pretty, dark-eyed maid-servant of the man who lives in 
the other part of the house.</p> 
<p>On the road from Hallowell to Augusta we saw little booths, in two places, 
erected on the roadside, where boys offered beer, apples, etc., for sale. We 
passed an Irishwoman with a child in her arms, and a heavy bundle, and 
afterwards an Irishman with a light bundle, sitting by the highway. They were 
husband and wife; and B---- says that an Irishman and his wife, on their 
journeys, do not usually walk side by side, but that the man gives the woman 
the heaviest burden to carry, and walks on lightly ahead!&nbsp;</p> 
<p>A thought comes into my mind: Which sort of house excites the most 
contemptuous feelings in the beholder,--such a house as Mr. ----'s, all 
circumstances considered, or the board-built and turf-buttressed hovels of 
these wild Irish, scattered about as if they had sprung up like mushrooms, in 
the dells and gorges, and along the banks of the river? Mushrooms, by the way, 
spring up where the roots of an old tree are hidden under the ground.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><em>Thursday,</em> <em>July</em> 13<em>th.</em>--Two small Canadian boys 
came to our house yesterday, with strawberries to sell. It sounds strangely to 
hear children bargaining in French on the borders of Yankee-land. Among other 
languages spoken hereabouts must be reckoned the wild Irish. Some of the 
laborers on the mill-dam can speak nothing else. The intermixture of foreigners 
sometimes gives rise to quarrels between them and the natives. As we were going 
to the village yesterday afternoon, we witnessed the beginning of a quarrel 
between a Canadian and a Yankee,--the latter accusing the former of striking 
his oxen. B---- thrust himself between and parted them; but they afterwards 
renewed their fray, and the Canadian, I believe, thrashed the Yankee 
soundly--for which he had to pay twelve dollars. Yet he was but a little fellow.
</p> 
<p>Coming to the Mansion House about supper-time, we found somewhat of a 
concourse of people, the Governor and Council being in session on the subject 
of the disputed territory. The British have lately imprisoned a man who was 
sent to take the census; and the Mainiacs are much excited on the subject. They 
wish the Governor to order out the militia at once&nbsp;and take possession of 
the territory with the strong hand. There was a British army-captain at the 
Mansion House; and an idea was thrown out that it would be as well to seize 
upon him as a hostage. I would, for the joke's sake, that it had been done. 
Personages at the tavern: the Governor, somewhat stared after as he walked 
through the bar-room; Councillors seated about, sitting on benches near the 
bar, or on the stoop along the front of the house; the Adjutant-General of the 
State; two young Blue-Noses, from Canada or the Provinces; a gentleman 
&quot;thumbing his hat&quot; for liquor, or perhaps playing off the trick of 
the &quot;honest landlord&quot; on some stranger. The decanters and 
wine-bottles on the move, and the beer and soda founts pouring out continual 
streams, with a whiz. Stage-drivers, etc., asked to drink with the aristocracy, 
and my host treating and being treated. Rubicund faces; breaths odorous of 
brandy-and-water. Occasionally the pop of a champagne cork.</p> 
<p>Returned home, and took a lesson in French of Mons. S---- . I like him very 
much, and have seldom met with a more honest, simple, and apparently so 
well-principled a man; which good qualities I impute to his being, by the 
father's side, of German blood. He looks more like a German--or, as he says, 
like a Swiss--than a Frenchman, having very light hair and a light complexion, 
and not a French expression. He is a vivacious little fellow, and wonderfully 
excitable to mirth; and it is truly a sight to see him laugh;--every feature 
partakes of his movement, and even his whole body shares in it, as he rises and 
dances about the room. He has great variety of conversation, commensurate with 
his experiences in life, and sometimes will talk Spanish,ore rotundo,--&nbsp;
sometimes imitate the Catholic priests, chanting Latin songs for the dead, in 
deep, gruff, awful tones, producing really a very strong impression,--then he 
will break out into a light, French song, perhaps of love, perhaps of war, 
acting it out, as if on the stage of a theatre: all this intermingled with 
continual fun, excited by the incidents of the passing moment. He has 
Frenchified all our names, calling B---- Monsieur Du Pont, myself M. de 
L'Aub&eacute;pine, and himself M. le Berger, and all, Knights of the 
Round-Table. And we live in great harmony and brotherhood, as queer a life as 
anybody leads, and as queer a set as may be found anywhere. In his more serious 
intervals, he talks philosophy and deism, and preaches obedience to the law of 
reason and morality; which law he says (and I believe him) he has so well 
observed, that, notwithstanding his residence in dissolute countries, he has 
never yet been sinful. He wishes me, eight or nine weeks hence, to accompany 
him on foot to Quebec, and then to Niagara and New York. I should like it well, 
if my circumstances and other considerations would permit. What pleases much in 
Mons. S---- is the simple and childlike enjoyment he finds in trifles, and the 
joy with which he speaks of going back to his own country, away from the dull 
Yankees, who here misunderstand and despise him. Yet I have never heard him 
speak harshly of them. I rather think that B---- and I will be remembered by 
him with more pleasure than anybody else in the country; for we have 
sympathized with him, and treated him kindly, and like a gentleman and an 
equal; and he comes to us at night as to home and friends.</p> 
<p>I went down to the river to-day to see B---- fish for salmon with a fly,--a 
hopeless business; for he&nbsp;says that only one instance has been known in 
the United States of salmon being taken otherwise than with a net. A few chubs 
were all the fruit of his piscatory efforts. But while looking at the rushing 
and rippling stream, I saw a great fish, some six feet long and thick in 
proportion, suddenly emerge at whole length, turn a somerset, and then vanish 
again beneath the water. It was of a glistening, yellowish brown, with its fins 
all spread, and looking very strange and startling, darting out so lifelike 
from the black water, throwing itself fully into the bright sunshine, and then 
lost to sight and to pursuit. I saw also a long, flat-bottomed boat go up the 
river, with a brisk wind, and against a strong stream. Its sails were of 
curious construction: a long mast, with two sails below, one on each side of 
the boat, and a broader one surmounting them. The sails were colored brown, and 
appeared like leather or skins, but were really cloth. At a distance, the 
vessel looked like, or at least I compared it to, a monstrous water-insect 
skimming along the river. If the sails had been crimson or yellow, the 
resemblance would have been much closer. There was a pretty spacious raised 
cabin in the after part of the boat. It moved along lightly, and disappeared 
between the woody banks. These boats have the two parallel sails attached to 
the same yard, and some have two sails, one surmounting the other. They trade 
to Waterville and thereabouts,--names, as &quot;Paul Pry,&quot; on their sails.
</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><em>Saturday,</em> <em>July</em> 15<em>th.</em>--Went with B---- yesterday 
to visit several Irish shanties, endeavoring to find out who had stolen some 
rails of a fence. At the first door at which we knocked (a shanty with an 
earthen&nbsp;mound heaped against the wall, two or three feet thick), the 
inmates were not up, though it was past eight o'clock. At last a middle-aged 
woman showed herself, half dressed, and completing her toilet. Threats were 
made of tearing down her house; for she is a lady of very indifferent morals, 
and sells rum. Few of these people are connected with the mill-dam,--or, at 
least, many are not so, but have intruded themselves into the vacant huts which 
were occupied by the mill-dam people last year. In two or three places 
hereabouts there is quite a village of these dwellings, with a clay and board 
chimney, or oftener an old barrel, smoked and charred with the fire. Some of 
their roofs are covered with sods, and appear almost subterranean. One of the 
little hamlets stands on both sides of a deep dell, wooded and hush-grown, with 
a vista, as it were, into the heart of a wood in one direction, and to the 
broad, sunny river in the other: there was a little rivulet, crossed by a 
plank, at the bottom of the dell. At two doors we saw very pretty and 
modest-looking young women,--one with a child in her arms. Indeed, they all 
have innumerable little children; and they are invariably in good health, 
though always dirty of face. They come to the door while their mothers are 
talking with the visitors, standing straight up on their bare legs, with their 
little plump bodies protruding, in one hand a small tin saucepan, and in the 
other an iron spoon, with unwashed mouths, looking as independent as any child 
or grown person in the land. They stare unabashed, but make no answer when 
spoken to. &quot;I've no call to your fence, Misser B----.&quot; It seems 
strange that a man should have the right, unarmed with any legal instrument, of 
tearing down the&nbsp;dwelling-houses of a score of families, and driving the 
inmates forth without a shelter. Yet B---- undoubtedly has this right; and it 
is not a little striking to see how quietly these people contemplate the 
probability of his exercising it,--resolving, indeed, to burrow in their holes 
as long as may be, yet caring about as little for an ejectment as those who 
could find a tenement anywhere, and less. Yet the women, amid all the trials of 
their situation, appear to have kept up the distinction between virtue and 
vice; those who can claim the former will not associate with the latter. When 
the women travel with young children, they carry the baby slung at their backs, 
and sleeping quietly. The dresses of the new-comers are old-fashioned, making 
them look aged before their time.</p> 
<p>Monsieur S---- shaving himself yesterday morning. He was in excellent 
spirits, and could not keep his tongue or body still more than long enough to 
make two or three consecutive strokes at his beard. Then he would turn, 
flourishing his razor and grimacing joyously, enacting droll antics, breaking 
out into scraps and verses of drinking-songs, &quot;A boire! &agrave; boire
!&quot;--then laughing heartily, and crying, &quot;Vive la ga&icirc;t&eacute;!
&quot;--then resuming his task, looking into the glass with grave face, on 
which, however, a grin would soon break out anew, and all his pranks would be 
repeated with variations. He turned this foolery to philosophy, by observing 
that mirth contributed to goodness of heart, and to make us love our 
fellow-creatures. Conversing with him in the evening, he affirmed, with evident 
belief in the truth of what he said, that he would have no objection, except 
that it would be a very foolish thing, to expose his whole heart, his whole 
inner man, to the view of the world. Not that there would&nbsp;not be much evil 
discovered there; but, as he was conscious of being in a state of mental and 
moral improvement, working out his progress onward, he would not shrink from 
such a scrutiny. This talk was introduced by his mentioning the 
&quot;Minister's Black Veil,&quot; which he said he had seen translated into 
French, as an exercise, by a Miss Appleton of Bangor.</p> 
<p>Saw by the river-side, late in the afternoon, one of the above-described 
boats going into the stream with the water rippling at the prow, from the 
strength of the current and of the boat's motion. By and by comes down a raft, 
perhaps twenty yards long, guided by two men, one at each end,--the raft itself 
of boards sawed at Waterville, and laden with square bundles of shingles and 
round bundles of clapboards. &quot;Friend,&quot; says one man, &quot;how is the 
tide now?&quot;--this being important to the onward progress. They make fast to 
a tree, in order to wait for the tide to rise a little higher. It would be 
pleasant enough to float down the Kennebec on one of these rafts, letting the 
river conduct you onward at its own pace, leisurely displaying to you all the 
wild or ordered beauties along its banks, and perhaps running you aground in 
some peculiarly picturesque spot, for your longer enjoyment of it. Another 
object, perhaps, is a solitary man paddling himself down the river in a small 
canoe, the light, lonely touch of his paddle in the water making the silence 
seem deeper. Every few minutes a sturgeon leaps forth, sometimes behind you, so 
that you merely hear the splash, and, turning hastily around, see nothing but 
the disturbed water. Sometimes he darts straight on end out of a quiet black 
spot on which your eyes happen to be fixed, and, when even his tail is clear of 
the surface, he falls down on his side and disappears.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>On the river-bank, an Irishwoman washing some clothes, surrounded by her 
children, whose babbling sounds pleasantly along the edge of the shore; and she 
also answers in a sweet, kindly, and cheerful voice, though an immoral woman, 
and without the certainty of bread or shelter from day to day. An Irishman 
sitting angling on the brink with an alder pole and a clothes-line. At frequent 
intervals, the scene is suddenly broken by a loud report like thunder, rolling 
along the banks, echoing and reverberating afar. It is a blast of rocks. Along 
the margin, sometimes sticks of timber made fast, either separately or several 
together; stones of some size, varying the pebbles and sand; a clayey spot, 
where a shallow brook runs into the river, not with a deep outlet, but finding 
its way across the bank in two or three single runlets. Looking upward into the 
deep glen whence it issues, you see its shady current. Elsewhere, a high 
acclivity, with the beach between it and the river, the ridge broken and caved 
away, so that the earth looks fresh and yellow, and is penetrated by the nests 
of birds. An old, shining tree-trunk, half in and half out of the water. An 
island of gravel, long and narrow, in the centre of the river. Chips, blocks of 
wood, slabs, and other scraps of lumber, strewed along the beach; logs drifting 
down. The high bank covered with various trees and shrubbery, and, in one 
place, two or three Irish shanties.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><em>Thursday,</em> July 20<em>th.</em>--A drive yesterday afternoon to a 
pond in the vicinity of Augusta, about nine miles off, to fish for white perch. 
Remarkables: the steering of the boat through the crooked, labyrinthine brook, 
into the open pond,--the man who acted as&nbsp;pilot,--his talking with B---- 
about politics, the bank, the iron money of &quot;a king who came to reign, in 
Greece, over a city called Sparta,&quot;--his advice to B---- to come amongst 
the laborers on the mill-dam, because it stimulated them &quot;to see a man 
grinning amongst them.&quot; The man took hearty tugs at a bottle of good 
Scotch whiskey, and became pretty merry. The fish caught were the yellow perch, 
which are not esteemed for eating; the white perch, a beautiful, silvery, 
round-backed fish, which bites eagerly, runs about with the line while being 
pulled up, makes good sport for the angler, and an admirable dish; a great 
chub; and three horned pouts, which swallow the hook into their lowest 
entrails. Several dozen fish were taken in an hour or two, and then we returned 
to the shop where we had left our horse and wagon, the pilot very eccentric 
behind us. It was a small, dingy shop, dimly lighted by a single inch of 
candle, faintly disclosing various boxes, barrels standing on end, articles 
hanging from the ceiling; the proprietor at the counter, whereon appear gin and 
brandy, respectively contained in a tin pint-measure and an earthenware jug, 
with two or three tumblers beside them, out of which nearly all the party 
drank; some coming up to the counter frankly, others lingering in the 
background, waiting to be pressed, two paying for their own liquor and 
withdrawing. B---- treated them twice round. The pilot, after drinking his 
brandy, gave a history of our fishing expedition, and how many and how large 
fish we caught. B---- making acquaintances and renewing them, and gaining great 
credit for liberality and free-heartedness,--two or three boys looking on and 
listening to the talk,--the shopkeeper smiling behind his counter, with the 
tarnished tin scales beside him,--the&nbsp;inch of candle burning down almost 
to extinction. So we got into our wagon, with the fish, and drove to Robinson's 
tavern, almost five miles off, where we supped and passed the night In the 
bar-room was a fat old countryman on a journey, and a quack doctor of the 
vicinity, and an Englishman with a peculiar accent. Seeing B----'s jointed and 
brass-mounted fishing-pole, he took it for a theodolite, and supposed that we 
had been on a surveying expedition. At supper, which consisted of bread, 
butter, cheese, cake, doughnuts and gooseberry-pie, we were waited upon by a 
tall, very tall woman, young and maiden-looking, yet with a strongly outlined 
and determined face. Afterwards we found her to be the wife of mine host. She 
poured out our tea, came in when we rang the table-bell to refill our cups, and 
again retired. While at supper, the fat old traveller was ushered through the 
room into a contiguous bedroom. My own chamber, apparently the best in the 
house, had its walls ornamented with a small, gilt-framed, foot-square 
looking-glass, with a hair-brush hanging beneath it; a record of the deaths of 
the family written on a black tomb, in an engraving, where a father, mother, 
and child were represented in a graveyard, weeping over said tomb; the mourners 
dressed in black, country-cut clothes; the engraving executed in Vermont. There 
was also a wood engraving of the Declaration of Independence, with fac-similes 
of the autographs; a portrait of the Empress Josephine, and another of Spring. 
In the two closets of this chamber were mine hostess's cloak, best bonnet, and 
go-to-meeting apparel. There was a good bed, in which I slept tolerably well, 
and, rising betimes, ate breakfast, consisting of some of our own fish, and 
then started&nbsp;for Augusta. The fat old traveller had gone off with the 
harness of our wagon, which the hostler had put on to his horse by mistake. The 
tavern-keeper gave us his own harness, and started in pursuit of the old man, 
who was probably aware of the exchange, and well satisfied with it.</p> 
<p>Our drive to Augusta, six or seven miles, was very pleasant, a heavy rain 
having fallen during the night, and laid the oppressive dust of the day before. 
The road lay parallel with the Kennebec, of which we occasionally had near 
glimpses. The country swells back from the river in hills and ridges, without 
any interval of level ground; and there were frequent woods, filling up the 
valleys or crowning the summits. The land is good, the farms look neat, and the 
houses comfortable. The latter are generally but of one story, but with large 
barns; and it was a good sign, that, while we saw no houses unfinished nor out 
of repair, one man at least had found it expedient to make an addition to his 
dwelling. At the distance of more than two miles, we had a view of white 
Augusta, with its steeples, and the State-House, at the farther end of the 
town. Observable matters along the road were the stage,--all the dust of 
yesterday brushed off, and no new dust contracted,--full of passengers, inside 
and out; among them some gentlemanly people and pretty girls, all looking fresh 
and unsullied, rosy, cheerful, and curious as to the face of the country, the 
faces of passing travellers, and the incidents of their journey; not yet 
damped, in the morning sunshine, by long miles of jolting over rough and hilly 
roads,--to compare this with their appearance at midday, and as they drive into 
Bangor at dusk; two women dashing along in a wagon, and with a&nbsp;child, 
rattling pretty speedily down hill;--people looking at us from the open doors 
and windows;--the children staring from the wayside;--the mowers stopping, for 
a moment, the sway of their scythes;--the matron of a family, indistinctly seen 
at some distance within the house her head and shoulders appearing through the 
window, drawing her handkerchief over her bosom, which had been uncovered to 
give the baby its breakfast,--the said baby, or its immediate predecessor, 
sitting at the door, turning round to creep away on all fours;--a man building 
a flat-bottomed boat by the roadside: he talked with B---- about the Boundary 
question, and swore fervently in favor of driving the British &quot;into hell's 
kitchen&quot; by main force.</p> 
<p>Colonel B----, the engineer of the mill-dam, is now here, after about a 
fortnight's absence. He is a plain country squire, with a good figure, but with 
rather a heavy brow; a rough complexion; a gait stiff, and a general rigidity 
of manner, something like that of a schoolmaster. He originated in a country 
town, and is a self-educated man. As he walked down the gravel-path to-day, 
after dinner, he took up a scythe, which one of the mowers had left on the 
sward, and began to mow, with quite a scientific swing. On the coming of the 
mower, he laid it down, perhaps a little ashamed of his amusement. I was 
interested in this; to see a man, after twenty-five years of scientific 
occupation, thus trying whether his arms retained their strength and skill for 
the labors of his youth,--mindful of the day when he wore striped trousers, and 
toiled in his shirt-sleeves,--and now tasting again, for pastime, this drudgery 
beneath a fervid sun. He stood awhile, looking at the workmen, and then went to 
oversee the laborers at the mill-dam.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><em>Monday,</em> July 24<em>th.</em>--I bathed in the river on Thursday 
evening, and in the brook at the old dam on Saturday and Sunday,--the former 
time at noon. The aspect of the solitude at noon was peculiarly impressive, 
there being a cloudless sunshine, no wind, no rustling of the forest-leaves, no 
waving of the boughs, no noise but the brawling and babbling of the stream, 
making its way among the stones, and pouring in a little cataract round one 
side of the mouldering dam. Looking up the brook, there was a long vista,--now 
ripples, now smooth and glassy spaces, now large rocks, almost blocking up the 
channel; while the trees stood upon either side, mostly straight, but here and 
there a branch thrusting itself out irregularly, and one tree, a pine, leaning 
over,--not bending,--but leaning at an angle over the brook, rough and ragged; 
birches, alders; the tallest of all the trees an old, dead, leafless pine, 
rising white and lonely, though closely surrounded by others. Along the brook, 
now the grass and herbage extended close to the water; now a small, sandy 
beach. The wall of rock before described looking as if it had been hewn, but 
with irregular strokes of the workman, doing his job by rough and ponderous 
strength,--now chancing to hew it away smoothly and cleanly, now carelessly 
smiting, and making gaps, or piling on the slabs of rock, so as to leave vacant 
spaces. In the interstices grow brake and broad-leaved forest-grass. The trees 
that spring from the top of this wall have their roots pressing close to the 
rock, so that there is no soil between; they cling powerfully, and grasp the 
crag tightly with their knotty fingers. The trees on both sides are so thick, 
that the sight and the thoughts are almost immediately lost among confused 
stems,&nbsp;branches, and clustering green leaves,--a narrow strip of bright 
blue sky above, the sunshine falling lustrously down, and making the pathway of 
the brook luminous below. Entering among the thickets, I find the soil strewn 
with old leaves of preceding seasons, through which may be seen a black or dark 
mould; the roots of trees stretch frequently across the path; often a 
moss-grown brown log lies athwart, and when you set your foot down, it sinks 
into the decaying substance,--into the heart of oak or pine. The leafy boughs 
and twigs of the underbrush enlace themselves before you, so that you must 
stoop your head to pass under, or thrust yourself through amain, while they 
sweep against your face, and perhaps knock off your hat. There are rocks mossy 
and slippery; sometimes you stagger, with a great rustling of branches, against 
a clump of bushes, and into the midst of it. From end to end of all this 
tangled shade goes a pathway scarcely worn, for the leaves are not trodden 
through, yet plain enough to the eye, winding gently to avoid tree-trunks and 
rocks and little hillocks. In the more open ground, the aspect of a tall, 
fire-blackened stump, standing alone, high up on a swell of land, that rises 
gradually from one side of the brook, like a monument. Yesterday, I passed a 
group of children in this solitary valley,--two boys, I think, and two girls. 
One of the little girls seemed to have suffered some wrong from her companions, 
for she was weeping and complaining violently. Another time, I came suddenly on 
a small Canadian boy, who was in a hollow place, among the ruined logs of an 
old causeway, picking raspberries,--lonely among bushes and gorges, far up the 
wild valley,--and the lonelier seemed the little boy for the bright sunshine, 
that&nbsp;showed no one else in a wide space of view except him and me.</p> 
<p>Remarkable items: the observation of Mons. S---- when B---- was saying 
something against the character of the French people,--&quot;You ought not to 
form an unfavorable judgment of a great nation from mean fellows like me, 
strolling about in a foreign country.&quot; I thought it very noble thus to 
protest against anything discreditable in himself personally being used against 
the honor of his country. He is a very singular person, with an originality in 
all his notions;--not that nobody has ever had such before, but that he has 
thought them out for himself. He told me yesterday that one of his sisters was 
a waiting-maid in the Rocher de Caucale. He is about the sincerest man I ever 
knew, never pretending to feelings that are not in him,--never flattering. His 
feelings do not seem to be warm, though they are kindly. He is so single-minded 
that he cannot understand badinage, but takes it all as if meant in earnest,--a 
German trait. He values himself greatly on being a Frenchman, though all his 
most valuable qualities come from Germany. His temperament is cool and pure, 
and he is greatly delighted with any attentions from the ladies. A short time 
since, a lady gave him a bouquet of roses and pinks; he capered and danced and 
sang, put it in water, and carried it to his own chamber; but he brought it out 
for us to see and admire two or three times a day, bestowing on it all the 
epithets of admiration in the French language,--&quot;Superbe! magnifique!
&quot; When some of the flowers began to fade, he made the rest, with others, 
into a new nosegay, and consulted us whether it would be fit to give to another 
lady. Contrast this French foppery with his solemn&nbsp;moods, when we sat in 
the twilight, or after B---- is abed, talking of Christianity and Deism, of 
ways of life, of marriage, of benevolence,--in short, of all deep matters of 
this world and the next. An evening or two since, he began singing all manner 
of English songs,--such as Mrs. Hemans's &quot;Landing of the Pilgrims,&quot; 
&quot;Auld Lang Syne,&quot; and some of Moore's,--the singing pretty fair, but 
in the oddest tone and accent. Occasionally he breaks out with scraps from 
French tragedies, which he spouts with corresponding action. He generally gets 
close to me in these displays of musical and histrionic talent. Once he offered 
to magnetize me in the manner of Monsieur P----.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><em>Wednesday,</em> July 26<em>th.</em>--Dined at Barker's yesterday. 
Before dinner, sat with several other persons in the stoop of the tavern. There 
were B----, J. A. Chandler, Clerk of the Court, a man of middle age or beyond, 
two or three stage people, and, near by, a negro, whom they call &quot;the 
Doctor,&quot; a crafty-looking fellow, one of whose occupations is nameless. In 
presence of this goodly company, a man of a depressed, neglected air, a soft, 
simple-looking fellow, with an anxious expression, in a laborer's dress, 
approached and inquired for Mr. Barker. Mine host being gone to Portland, the 
stranger was directed to the bar-keeper, who stood at the door. The man asked 
where he should find one Mary Ann Russell,--a question which excited general 
and hardly suppressed mirth; for the said Mary Ann is one of a knot of women 
who were routed on Sunday evening by Barker and a constable. The man was told 
that the black fellow would give him all the information he wanted. The black 
fellow asked,--&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&quot;Do you want to see her?&quot;</p> 
<p>Others of the by-standers or by-sitters put various questions as to the 
nature of the man's business with Mary Ann. One asked,--</p> 
<p>&quot;Is she your daughter?&quot;</p> 
<p>&quot;Why, a little nearer than that, I calkilate,&quot; said the poor 
devil.</p> 
<p>Here the mirth was increased, it being evident that the woman was his wife. 
The man seemed too simple and obtuse to comprehend the ridicule of his 
situation, or to be rendered very miserable by it. Nevertheless, he made some 
touching points.</p> 
<p>&quot;A man generally places some little dependence on his wife,&quot; said 
he, &quot;whether she's good or not.&quot;</p> 
<p>He meant, probably, that he rests some affection on her. He told us that 
she had behaved well, till committed to jail for striking a child; and I 
believe he was absent from home at the time, and had not seen her since. And 
now he was in search of her, intending, doubtless, to do his best to get her 
out of her troubles, and then to take her back to his home. Some advised him 
not to look after her; others recommended him to pay &quot;the Doctor&quot; 
aforesaid for guiding him to her; which finally &quot;the Doctor&quot; did, in 
consideration of a treat; and the fellow went off, having heard little but 
gibes and not one word of sympathy! I would like to have witnessed his meeting 
with his wife.</p> 
<p>There was a moral picturesqueness in the contrasts of the scene,--a man 
moved as deeply as his nature would admit, in the midst of hardened, gibing 
spectators, heartless towards him. It is worth thinking over and studying out. 
He seemed rather hurt and pricked by the jests thrown at him, yet bore it 
patiently, and&nbsp;sometimes almost joined in the laugh, being of an easy, 
unenergetic temper.</p> 
<p>Hints for characters: Nancy, a pretty, black-eyed, intelligent 
servant-girl, living in Captain H----'s family. She comes daily to make the 
beds in our part of the house, and exchanges a good-morning with me, in a 
pleasant voice, and with a glance and smile,--somewhat shy, because we are not 
acquainted, yet capable of being made conversable. She washes once a week, and 
may be seen standing over her tub, with her handkerchief somewhat displaced 
from her white neck, because it is hot. Often she stands with her bare arms in 
the water, talking with Mrs H----, or looks through the window, perhaps, at 
B----, or somebody else crossing the yard,--rather thoughtfully, but soon 
smiling or laughing. Then goeth she for a pail of water. In the afternoon, very 
probably, she dresses herself in silks, looking not only pretty, but lady-like, 
and strolls round the house, not unconscious that some gentleman may be staring 
at her from behind the green blinds. After supper, she walks to the village. 
Morning and evening, she goes a-milking. And thus passes her life, cheerfully, 
usefully, virtuously, with hopes, doubtless, of a husband and children.--Mrs. 
H---- is a particularly plump, soft-fleshed, fair-complexioned, comely woman 
enough, with rather a simple countenance, not nearly so piquant as Nancy's. Her 
walk has something of the roll or waddle of a fat woman, though it were too 
much to call her fat. She seems to be a sociable body, probably 
laughter-loving. Captain H---- himself has commanded a steamboat, and has a 
certain knowledge of life.</p> 
<p>Query, in relation to the man's missing wife, how much desire and 
resolution of doing her duty by her&nbsp;husband can a wife retain, while 
injuring him in what is deemed the most essential point?</p> 
<p>Observation. The effect of morning sunshine on the wet grass, on sloping 
and swelling land, between the spectator and the sun at some distance, as 
across a lawn. It diffused a dim brilliancy over the whole surface of the 
field. The mists, slow-rising farther off, part resting on the earth, the 
remainder of the column already ascending so high that you doubt whether to 
call it a fog or a cloud.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><em>Friday,</em> July 28<em>th.</em>--Saw my classmate and formerly 
intimate friend, ----, for the first time since we graduated. He has met with 
good success in life, in spite of circumstance, having struggled upward against 
bitter opposition, by the force of his own abilities, to be a member of 
Congress, after having been for some time the leader of his party in the State 
Legislature. We met like old friends, and conversed almost as freely as we used 
to do in college days, twelve years ago and more. He is a singular person, 
shrewd, crafty, insinuating, with wonderful tact, seizing on each man by his 
manageable point, and using him for his own purpose, often without the man's 
suspecting that he is made a tool of; and yet, artificial as his character 
would seem to be, his conversation, at least to myself, was full of natural 
feeling, the expression of which can hardly be mistaken, and his revelations 
with regard to himself had really a great deal of frankness. He spoke of his 
ambition, of the obstacles which he had encountered, of the means by which he 
had overcome them, imputing great efficacy to his personal intercourse with 
people, and his study of their characters; then of his course as a member of the
&nbsp;Legislature and Speaker, and his style of speaking and its effects; of 
the dishonorable things which had been imputed to him, and in what manner he 
had repelled the charges. In short, he would seem to have opened himself very 
freely as to his public life. Then, as to his private affairs, he spoke of his 
marriage, of his wife, his children, and told me, with tears in his eyes, of 
the death of a dear little girl, and how it affected him, and how impossible it 
had been for him to believe that she was really to die. A man of the most open 
nature might well have been more reserved to a friend, after twelve years' 
separation, than--was to me. Nevertheless, he is really a crafty man, 
concealing, like a murder-secret, anything that it is not good for him to have 
known. He by no means feigns the good-feeling that he professes, nor is there 
anything affected in the frankness of his conversation; and it is this that 
makes him so very fascinating. There is such a quantity of truth and kindliness 
and warm affections, that a man's heart opens to him, in spite of himself. He 
deceives by truth. And not only is he crafty, but, when occasion demands, bold 
and fierce as a tiger, determined, and even straightforward and undisguised in 
his measures,--a daring fellow as well as a sly one. Yet, notwithstanding his 
consummate art, the general estimate of his character seems to be pretty just. 
Hardly anybody, probably, thinks him better than he is, and many think him 
worse. Nevertheless, if no overwhelming discovery of rascality be made, he will 
always possess influence; though I should hardly think that he would take any 
prominent part in Congress. As to any rascality, I rather believe that he has 
thought out for himself a much higher system of morality than any natural 
integrity would have&nbsp;prompted him to adopt; that he has seen the thorough 
advantage of morality and honesty; and the sentiment of these qualities has now 
got into his mind and spirit, and pretty well impregnated them. I believe him 
to be about as honest as the great run of the world, with something even 
approaching to high-mindedness. His person in some degree accords with his 
character,--thin and with a thin face, sharp features, sallow, a projecting 
brow not very high, deep-set eyes, an insinuating smile and look, when he meets 
you, and is about to address you. I should think that he would do away with 
this peculiar expression, for it reveals more of himself than can be detected 
in any other way, in personal intercourse with him. Upon the whole, I have 
quite a good liking for him, and mean to go to ---- to see him.</p> 
<p>Observation. A steam-engine across the river, which almost continually 
during the day, and sometimes all night, may be heard puffing and panting, as 
if it uttered groans for being compelled to labor in the heat and sunshine, and 
when the world is asleep also.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><em>Monday,</em> July 31<em>st.</em>--Nothing remarkable to record. A child 
asleep in a young lady's arms,--a little baby, two or three months old. 
Whenever anything partially disturbed the child, as, for instance, when the 
young lady or a by-stander patted its cheek or rubbed its chin, the child would 
smile; then all its dreams seemed to be of pleasure and happiness. At first the 
smile was so faint, that I doubted whether it were really a smile or no; but, 
on further efforts, it brightened forth very decidedly. This, without opening 
its eyes.--A constable, a homely, good-natured, business-looking man, with a 
warrant against an&nbsp;Irishman's wife for throwing a brick-bat at a fellow. 
He gave good advice to the Irishman about the best method of coming easiest 
through the affair. Finally settled,--the justice agreeing to relinquish his 
fees, on condition that the Irishman would pay for the mending of his old boots!
</p> 
<p>I went with Monsieur S---- yesterday to pick raspberries. He fell through 
an old log bridge thrown over a hollow; looking back, only his head and 
shoulders appeared through the rotten logs and among the bushes.--A shower 
coming on, the rapid running of a little barefooted boy, coming up unheard, and 
dashing swiftly past us, and showing the soles of his naked feet as he ran 
adown the path, and up the opposite rise.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><em>Tuesday,</em> August 1<em>st.</em>--There having been a heavy rain 
yesterday, a nest of chimney-swallows was washed down the chimney into the 
fireplace of one of the front rooms. My attention was drawn to them by a most 
obstreperous twittering; and looking behind the fire-board, there were three 
young birds, clinging with their feet against one of the jambs, looking at me, 
open-mouthed, and all clamoring together, so as quite to fill the room with the 
short, eager, frightened sound. The old birds, by certain signs upon the floor 
of the room, appeared to have fallen victims to the appetite of the cat. La 
belle Nancy provided a basket filled with cotton-wool, into which the poor 
little devils were put; and I tried to feed them with soaked bread, of which, 
however, they did not eat with much relish. Tom, the Irish boy, gave it as his 
opinion that they were not old enough to be weaned. I hung the basket out of 
the window, in the sunshine, and upon&nbsp;looking in, an hour or two after, 
found that two of the birds had escaped. The other I tried to feed, and 
sometimes, when a morsel of bread was thrust into its open mouth, it would 
swallow it. But it appeared to suffer very much, vociferating loudly when 
disturbed, and panting, in a sluggish agony, with eyes closed, or half opened, 
when let alone. It distressed me a good deal; and I felt relieved, though 
somewhat shocked, when B---- put an end to its misery by squeezing its head and 
throwing it out of the window. They were of a slate-color, and might, I 
suppose, have been able to shift for themselves.--The other day a little yellow 
bird flew into one of the empty rooms, of which there are half a dozen on the 
lower floor, and could not find his way out again, flying at the glass of the 
windows, instead of at the door, thumping his head against the panes or against 
the ceiling. I drove him into the entry and chased him from end to end, 
endeavoring to make him fly through one of the open doors. He would fly at the 
circular light over the door, clinging to the casement, sometimes alighting on 
one of the two glass lamps, or on the cords that suspended them, uttering an 
affrighted and melancholy cry whenever I came near and flapped my handkerchief, 
and appearing quite tired and sinking into despair. At last he happened to fly 
low enough to pass through the door, and immediately vanished into the gladsome 
sunshine.--Ludicrous situation of a man, drawing his chaise down a sloping 
bank, to wash in the river. The chaise got the better of him, and, rushing 
downward as if it were possessed, compelled him to run at full speed, and drove 
him up to his chin into the water. A singular instance, that a chaise may run 
away with a man without a horse!</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><em>Saturday August</em> 12<em>th.</em>--Left Augusta a week ago this 
morning for ----. Nothing particular in our drive across the country. 
Fellow-passenger, a Boston dry-goods dealer, travelling to collect bills. At 
many of the country shops he would get out, and show his unwelcome visage. In 
the tavern, prints from Scripture, varnished and on rollers,--such as the 
Judgment of Christ; also a droll set of colored engravings of the story of the 
Prodigal Son, the figures being clad in modern costume,--or, at least, that of 
not more than half a century ago. The father, a grave, clerical person, with a 
white wig and black broadcloth suit; the son, with a cocked hat and laced 
clothes, drinking wine out of a glass, and caressing a woman in fashionable 
dress. At ---- a nice, comfortable boarding-house tavern, without a bar or any 
sort of wines or spirits. An old lady from Boston, with her three daughters, 
one of whom was teaching music, and the other two schoolmistresses. A frank, 
free, mirthful daughter of the landlady, about twenty-four years old, between 
whom and myself there immediately sprang up a flirtation, which made us both 
feel rather melancholy when we parted on Tuesday morning. Music in the evening, 
with a song by a rather pretty, fantastic little mischief of a brunette, about 
eighteen years old, who has married within a year, and spent the last summer in 
a trip to the Springs and elsewhere. Her manner of walking is by jerks, with a 
quiver, as if she were made of calves-feet jelly. I talk with everybody: to 
Mrs. T---- good sense,--to Mary, good sense, with a mixture of fun,--to Mrs. 
G----, sentiment, romance, and nonsense.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Walked with ---- to see General Knox's old mansion,--a large, rusty-looking 
edifice of wood, with&nbsp;some grandeur in the architecture, standing on the 
banks of the river, close by the site of an old burial-ground, and near where 
an ancient fort had been erected for defence against the French and Indians. 
General Knox once owned a square of thirty miles in this part of the country, 
and he wished to settle it in with a tenantry, after the fashion of English 
gentlemen. He would permit no edifice to be erected within a certain distance 
of his mansion. His patent covered, of course, the whole present town of 
Waldoborough, and divers other flourishing commercial and country villages, and 
would have been of incalculable value could it have remained unbroken to the 
present time. But the General lived in grand style, and received throngs of 
visitors from foreign parts, and was obliged to part with large tracts of his 
possessions, till now there is little left but the ruinous mansion and the 
ground immediately around it. His tomb stands near the house,--a spacious 
receptable, an iron door at the end of a turf-covered mound, and surmounted by 
an obelisk of marble. There are inscriptions to the memory of several of his 
family; for he had many children, all of whom are now dead, except one 
daughter, a widow of fifty, recently married to Hon. John H----. There is a 
stone fence round the monument. On the outside of this are the gravestones, and 
large, flat tombstones of the ancient burial-ground,--the tombstones being of 
red freestone, with vacant spaces, formerly inlaid with slate, on which were 
the inscriptions, and perhaps coats of arms. One of these spaces was in the 
shape of a heart. The people were very wrathful that the General should have 
laid out his grounds over this old burial-place; and he dared never throw down 
the gravestones, though his wife, a haughty&nbsp;English lady, often teased him 
to do so. But when the old general was dead, Lady Knox (as they called her) 
caused them to be prostrated, as they now lie. She was a woman of violent 
passions, and so proud an aristocrat, that, as long as she lived, she would 
never enter any house in the town except her own. When, a married daughter was 
ill, she used to go in her carriage to the door and send up to inquire how she 
did. The General was personally very popular; but his wife ruled him. The house 
and its vicinity, and the whole tract covered by Knox's patent, may be taken as 
an illustration of what must be the result of American schemes of aristocracy. 
It is not forty years since this house was built, and Knox was in his glory; 
but now the house is all in decay, while within a stone's-throw of it there is 
a street of smart white edifices of one and two stories, occupied chiefly by 
thriving mechanics, which has been laid out where Knox meant to have forests 
and parks. On the banks of the river, where he intended to have only one wharf 
for his own West Indian vessels and yacht, there are two wharves, with stores 
and a lime-kiln. Little appertains to the mansion except the tomb and the old 
burial-ground, and the old fort.</p> 
<p>The descendants are all poor, and the inheritance was merely sufficient to 
make a dissipated and drunken fellow of the only one of the old General's sons 
who survived to middle age. The man's habits were as bad as possible as long as 
he had any money; but when quite ruined, he reformed. The daughter, the only 
survivor among Knox's children (herself childless), is a mild, amiable woman, 
therein totally different from her mother. Knox, when he first visited his 
estate, arriving in a vessel, was waited upon by a&nbsp;deputation of the 
squatters, who had resolved to resist him to the death. He received them with 
genial courtesy, made them dine with him aboard the vessel, and sent them back 
to their constituents in great love and admiration of him. He used to have a 
vessel running to Philadelphia, I think, and bringing him all sorts of 
delicacies. His way of raising money was to give a mortgage on his estate of a 
hundred thousand dollars at a time, and receive that nominal amount in goods, 
which he would immediately sell at auction for perhaps thirty thousand. He died 
by a chicken-bone. Near the house are the remains of a covered way, by which 
the French once attempted to gain admittance into the fort; but the work caved 
in and buried a good many of them, and the rest gave up the siege. There was 
recently an old inhabitant living who remembered when the people used to reside 
in the fort.</p> 
<p>Owl's Head,--a watering-place, terminating a point of land, six or seven 
miles from Thomaston. A long island shuts out the prospect of the sea. Hither 
coasters and fishing-smacks run in when a storm is anticipated. Two fat 
landlords, both young men, with something of a contrast in their dispositions: 
one of them being a brisk, lively, active, jesting, fat man; the other more 
heavy and inert, making jests sluggishly, if at all. Aboard the steamboat, 
Professor Stuart of Andover, sitting on a sofa in the saloon, generally in 
conversation with some person, resolving their doubts on one point or another, 
speaking in a very audible voice; and strangers standing or sitting around to 
hear him, as if he were an ancient apostle or philosopher. He is a bulky man, 
with a large, massive face, particularly calm in its expression, and mild 
enough to be pleasing. When not otherwise occupied, h&nbsp;reads, without much 
notice of what is going on around him. He speaks without effort, yet 
thoughtfully.</p> 
<p>We got lost in a fog the morning after leaving Owl's Head. Fired a brass 
cannon, rang bell, blew steam, like a whale snorting. After one of the reports 
of the cannon, we heard a horn blown at no great distance, the sound coming 
soon after the report. Doubtful whether it came from the shore or a vessel. 
Continued our ringing and snorting; and by and by something was seen to mingle 
with the fog that obscured everything beyond fifty yards from us. At first it 
seemed only like a denser wreath of fog; it darkened still more, till it took 
the aspect of sails; then the hull of a small schooner came beating down 
towards us, the wind laying her over towards us, so that her gunwale was almost 
in the water, and we could see the whole of her sloping deck.</p> 
<p>&quot;Schooner ahoy!&quot; say we. &quot;Halloo! Have you seen Boston Light 
this morning?&quot;</p> 
<p>&quot;Yes; it bears north-northwest, two miles distant.&quot; </p> 
<p>&quot;Very much obliged to you,&quot; cries our captain.</p> 
<p>So the schooner vanishes into the mist behind. We get up our steam, and 
soon enter the harbor, meeting vessels of every rig; and the fog, clearing 
away, shows a cloudy sky. Aboard, an old one-eyed sailor, who had lost one of 
his feet, and had walked on the stump from Eastport to Bangor, thereby making a 
shocking ulcer.</p> 
<p>Penobscot Bay is full of islands, close to which the steamboat is 
continually passing. Some are large, with portions of forest and portions of 
cleared land; some are mere rocks, with a little green or none, and inhabited 
by sea-birds, which fly and flap about hoarsely. Their eggs may be gathered by 
the bushel, and are&nbsp;good to eat. Other islands have one house and barn on 
them, this sole family being lords and rulers of all the land which the sea 
girds. The owner of such an island must have a peculiar sense of property and 
lordship; he must feel more like his own master and his own man than other 
people can. Other islands, perhaps high, precipitous, black bluffs, are crowned 
with a white light-house, whence, as evening comes on, twinkles a star across 
the melancholy deep,--seen by vessels coming on the coast, seen from the 
mainland, seen from island to island. Darkness descending, and, looking down at 
the broad wake left by the wheels of the steamboat, we may see sparkles of 
sea-fire glittering through the gloom.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><em>Salem, August</em> 22<em>d.-</em>-A walk yesterday afternoon down to 
the Juniper and Winter Island. Singular effect of partial sunshine, the sky 
being broadly and heavily clouded, and land and sea, in consequence, being 
generally overspread with a sombre gloom. But the sunshine, somehow or other, 
found its way between the interstices of the clouds, and illuminated some of 
the distant objects very vividly. The white sails of a ship caught it, and 
gleamed brilliant as sunny snow, the hull being scarcely visible, and the sea 
around dark; other smaller vessels too, so that they looked like 
heavenly-winged things, just alighting on a dismal world. Shifting their sails, 
perhaps, or going on another tack, they almost disappear at once in the obscure 
distance. Islands are seen in summer sunshine and green glory; their rocks also 
sunny and their beaches white; while other islands, for no apparent reason, are 
in deep shade, and share the gloom of the rest of the world. Sometimes part of 
an island is&nbsp;illuminated and part dark. When the sunshine falls on a very 
distant island, nearer ones being in shade, it seems greatly to extend the 
bounds of visible space, and put the horizon to a farther distance. The sea 
roughly rushing against the shore, and dashing against the rocks, and grating 
back over the sands. A boat a little way from the shore, tossing and swinging 
at anchor. Beach birds flitting from place to place.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The family seat of the Hawthornes is Wigcastle, Wigton, Wiltshire. The 
present head of the family, now residing there, is Hugh Hawthorne. William 
Hawthorne, who came over in 1635-36, was a younger brother of the family.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>A young man and girl meet together, each in search of a person to be known 
by some particular sign. They watch and wait a great while for that person to 
pass. At last some casual circumstance discloses that each is the one that the 
other is waiting for. Moral,--that what we need for our happiness is often 
close at hand, if we knew but how to seek for it.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The journal of a human heart for a single day in ordinary circumstances. 
The lights and shadows that flit across it; its internal vicissitudes.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Distrust to be thus exemplified: Various good and desirable things to be 
presented to a young man, and offered to his acceptance,--as a friend, a wife, 
a fortune; but he to refuse them all, suspecting that it is merely a delusion. 
Yet all to be real, and he to be told so, when too late.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>A man tries to be happy in love; he cannot sincerely give his heart, and 
the affair seems all a dream. In domestic life, the same; in politics, a 
seeming patriot; but still he is sincere, and all seems like a theatre.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>An old man, on a summer day, sits on a hill-top, or on the observatory of 
his house, and sees the sun's light pass from one object to another connected 
with the events of his past life,--as the school-house, the place where his 
wife lived in her maidenhood,--its setting beams falling on the churchyard.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>An idle man's pleasures and occupations and thoughts during a day spent by 
the seashore: among them, that of sitting on the top of a cliff, and throwing 
stones at his own shadow, far below.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>A blind man to set forth on a walk through ways unknown to him, and to 
trust to the guidance of anybody who will take the trouble; the different 
characters who would undertake it: some mischievous, some well-meaning, but 
incapable; perhaps one blind man undertakes to lead another. At last, possibly, 
he rejects all guidance, and blunders on by himself.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>In the cabinet of the Essex Historical Society, old portraits.--Governor 
Leverett; a dark mustachioed face, the figure two thirds length, clothed in a 
sort of frock-coat, buttoned, and a broad sword-belt girded round the waist, 
and fastened with a large steel buckle; the hilt of the sword 
steel,--altogether very striking. Sir William Pepperell, in English 
regimentals, coat, waistcoat, and breeches, all of red&nbsp;broad-cloth, richly 
gold-embroidered; he holds a general's truncheon in his right hand, and extends 
the left towards the batteries erected against Louisbourg, in the country near 
which he is standing. Endicott, Pyncheon, and others, in scarlet robes, bands, 
etc. Half a dozen or more family portraits of the Olivers, some in plain 
dresses, brown, crimson, or claret; others with gorgeous gold-embroidered 
waistcoats, descending almost to the knees, so as to form the most conspicuous 
article of dress. Ladies, with lace ruffles, the painting of which, in one of 
the pictures, cost five guineas. Peter Oliver, who was crazy, used to fight 
with these family pictures in the old Mansion House; and the face and breast of 
one lady bear cuts and stabs inflicted by him. Miniatures in oil, with the 
paint peeling off, of stern, old, yellow faces. Oliver Cromwell, apparently an 
old picture, half length, or one third, in an oval frame, probably painted for 
some New England partisan. Some pictures that had been partly obliterated by 
scrubbing with sand. The dresses, embroidery, laces of the Oliver family are 
generally better done than the faces. Governor Leverett's gloves,--the glove 
part of coarse leather, but round the wrist a deep, three or four inch border 
of spangles and silver embroidery. Old drinking-glasses, with tall stalks. A 
black glass bottle, stamped with the name of Philip English, with a broad 
bottom. The baby-linen, etc., of Governor Bradford of Plymouth County. Old 
manuscript sermons, some written in short-hand, others in a hand that seems 
learnt from print.</p> 
<p>Nothing gives a stronger idea of old worm-eaten aristocracy--of a family 
being crazy with age, and of its being time that it was extinct--than these
&nbsp;black, dusty, faded, antique-dressed portraits, such as those of the 
Oliver family; the identical old white wig of an ancient minister producing 
somewhat the impression that his very scalp, or some other portion of his 
personal self, would do.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The excruciating agonies which Nature inflicts on men (who break her laws) 
to be represented as the work of human tormentors; as the gout, by screwing the 
toes. Thus we might find that worse than the tortures of the Spanish 
Inquisition are daily suffered without exciting notice.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Suppose a married couple fondly attached to one another, and to think that 
they lived solely for one another; then it to be found out that they were 
divorced, or that they might separate if they chose. What would be its effect?

<p><em>Monday,</em> August 27<em>th.</em>--Went to Boston last Wednesday. 
Remarkables:--An author at the American Stationers' Company, slapping his hand 
on his manuscript, and crying, &quot;I'm going to publish.&quot;--An excursion 
aboard a steamboat to Thompson's Island, to visit the Manual Labor School for 
boys. Aboard the steamboat several poets and various other authors; a 
Commodore, ---- Colton, a small, dark brown, sickly man, with a good deal of 
roughness in his address; Mr. Waterston, talking poetry and philosophy. 
Examination and exhibition of the boys, little tanned agriculturists. After 
examination, a stroll round the island, examining the products, as wheat in 
sheaves on the stubble-field; oats, somewhat blighted and spoiled; great 
pumpkins elsewhere; pastures; mowing ground;--all cultivated by the boys. Their 
residence, a great brick building, painted green, and standing on the summit of 
a rising ground, exposed to the winds of the bay. Vessels flitting past; great 
ships, with intricacy of rigging and various sails; schooners, sloops, with 
their one or two broad sheets of canvas: going on different tacks, so that the 
spectator might think that there was a different wind for each vessel, or that 
they scudded across the sea spontaneously, whither their own wills led them. 
The farm boys remain insulated, looking at the passing show, within sight of 
the city, yet having nothing to do with it; beholding their fellow-creatures 
skimming by them in winged machines, and steamboats snorting and puffing 
through the waves. Methinks an island would be the most desirable of all landed 
property, for it seems like a little world by itself; and the water may answer 
instead of the atmosphere that surrounds planets. The boys swinging, two 
together, standing up, and almost causing the ropes and their bodies to stretch 
out horizontally. On our departure, they ranged themselves on the rails of the 
fence, and, being dressed in blue, looked not unlike a flock of pigeons.</p> 
<p>On Friday, a visit to the Navy Yard at Charlestown, in company with the 
Naval Officer of Boston, and Cilley. Dined aboard the revenue-cutter Hamilton. 
A pretty cabin, finished off with bird's-eye maple and mahogany; two 
looking-glasses. Two officers in blue frocks, with a stripe of lace on each 
shoulder. Dinner, chowder, fried fish, corned beef,--claret, afterwards 
champagne. The waiter tells the Captain of the cutter that Captain Percival 
(Commander of the Navy Yard) is sitting on the deck of the anchor hoy (which 
lies inside of the cutter), smoking his cigar.&nbsp;The captain sends him a 
glass of champagne, and inquires of the waiter what Percival says of it. 
&quot;He said, sir, 'What does he send me this damned stuff for?' but drinks, 
nevertheless.&quot; The Captain characterizes Percival as the roughest old 
devil that ever was in his manners, but a kind, good-hearted man at bottom. By 
and by comes in the steward. &quot;Captain Percival is coming aboard of you, 
sir.&quot; &quot;Well, ask him to walk down into the cabin&quot;; and shortly 
down comes old Captain Percival, a white-haired, thin-visaged, weather-worn old 
gentleman, in a blue, Quaker-cut coat, with tarnished lace and brass buttons, a 
pair of drab pantaloons, and brown waistcoat. There was an eccentric expression 
in his face, which seemed partly wilful, partly natural. He has not risen to 
his present rank in the regular line of the profession; but entered the navy as 
a sailing-master, and has all the roughness of that class of officers. 
Nevertheless, he knows how to behave and to talk like a gentleman. Sitting 
down, and taking in hand a glass of champagne, he began a lecture on economy, 
and how well it was that Uncle Sam had a broad back, being compelled to bear so 
many burdens as were laid on it,--alluding to the table covered with 
wine-bottles. Then he spoke of the fitting up of the cabin with expensive 
woods,--of the brooch in Captain Scott's bosom. Then he proceeded to discourse 
of politics, taking the opposite side to Cilley, and arguing with much 
pertinacity. He seems to have moulded and shaped himself to his own whims, till 
a sort of rough affectation has become thoroughly imbued throughout a kindly 
nature. He is full of antique prejudices against the modern fashions of the 
younger officers, their mustaches and such fripperies, and prophesies little 
better than disgrace&nbsp;in case of another war; owning that the boys would 
fight for their country, and die for her, but denying that there are any 
officers now like Hull and Stuart, whose exploits, nevertheless, he greatly 
depreciated, saying that the Boxer and Enterprise fought the only equal battle 
which we won during the war; and that, in that action, an officer had proposed 
to haul down the Stars and Stripes, and a common sailor threatened to cut him 
to pieces if he should do so. He spoke of Bainbridge as a sot and a poltroon, 
who wanted to run from the Macedonian, pretending to take her for a 
line-of-battle ship; of Commodore Elliot as a liar; but praised Commodore 
Downes in the highest terms. Percival seems to be the very pattern of old 
integrity; taking as much care of Uncle Sam's interests as if all the money 
expended were to come out of his own pocket. This quality was displayed in his 
resistance to the demand of a new patent capstan for the revenue-cutter, which, 
however, Scott is resolved in such a sailor-like way to get, that he will 
probably succeed. Percival spoke to me of how his business in the yard absorbed 
him, especially the fitting of the Columbus, seventy-four, of which ship he 
discoursed with great enthusiasm. He seems to have no ambition beyond his 
present duties, perhaps never had any; at any rate, he now passes his life with 
a sort of gruff contentedness, grumbling and growling, yet in good humor 
enough. He is conscious of his peculiarities; for when I asked him whether it 
would be well to make a naval officer Secretary of the Navy, he said, &quot;God 
forbid, for that an old sailor was always full of prejudices and stubborn 
whim-whams,&quot; instancing himself; whereto I agreed. We went round the Navy 
Yard with Percival and Commodore Downes, the latter a&nbsp;sailor and a 
gentleman too, with rather more of the ocean than the drawing-room about him, 
but courteous, frank, and good-natured. We looked at rope-walks, rigging-lofts, 
ships in the stocks; and saw the sailors of the station laughing and sporting 
with great mirth and cheerfulness, which the Commodore said was much increased 
at sea. We returned to the wharf at Boston in the cutter's boat. Captain Scott, 
of the cutter, told me a singular story of what occurred during the action 
between the Constitution and Macedonian,--he being powder-monkey aboard the 
former ship. A cannon-shot came through the ship's side, and a man's head was 
struck off, probably by a splinter, for it was done without bruising the head 
or body, as clean as by a razor. Well, the man was walking pretty briskly at 
the time of the accident; and Scott seriously affirmed that he kept walking 
onward at the same pace, with two jets of blood gushing from his headless 
trunk, till, after going about twenty feet without a head, he sunk down at 
once, with his legs under him.</p> 
<p>[In corroboration of the truth of this, see Lord Bacon, Century IV. of his 
&quot;Sylva Sylvarum,&quot; or Natural History, in Ten Centuries, paragraph 
400.]</p> 
<p>On Saturday, I called to see E. H----, having previously appointed a 
meeting for the purpose of inquiring about our name. He is an old bachelor, and 
truly forlorn. The pride of ancestry seems to be his great hobby. He had a good 
many old papers in his desk at the Custom House, which he produced and 
dissertated upon, and afterwards went with me to his sister's, and showed me an 
old book, with a record of the children of the first emigrant (who came over 
two hundred years ago), in his own handwriting. E----'s&nbsp;manners are 
gentlemanly, and he seems to be very well informed. At a little distance, I 
think, one would take him to be not much over thirty; but nearer at hand one 
finds him to look rather venerable,--perhaps fifty or more. He is nervous, and 
his hands shook while he was looking over the papers, as if he had been 
startled by my visit; and when we came to the crossings of streets, he darted 
across, cautioning me, as if both were in great danger to be run over. 
Nevertheless, being very quick-tempered, he would face the Devil if at all 
irritated. He gave a most forlorn description of his life; how, when he came to 
Salem, there was nobody except Mr. ---- whom he cared about seeing; how his 
position prevented him from accepting of civilities, because he had no home 
where he could return them; in short, he seemed about as miserable a being as 
is to be found anywhere,--lonely, and with sensitiveness to feel his 
loneliness, and capacities, now withered, to have enjoyed the sweets of life. I 
suppose he is comfortable enough when busied in his duties at the Custom House; 
for when I spoke to him at my entrance, he was too much absorbed to hear me at 
first. As we walked, he kept telling stories of the family, which seemed to 
have comprised many oddities, eccentric men and women, recluses and other 
kinds,--one of old Philip English (a Jersey man, the name originally 
L'Anglais), who had been persecuted by John Hawthorne, of witch-time memory, 
and a violent quarrel ensued. When Philip lay on his death-bed, he consented to 
forgive his persecutor; &quot;But if I get well,&quot; said he, &quot;I'll be 
damned if I forgive him!&quot; This Philip left daughters, one of whom married, 
I believe, the son of the persecuting John, and thus all the legitimate blood 
of English is&nbsp;in our family. E---- passed from the matters of birth, 
pedigree, and ancestral pride to give vent to the most arrant democracy and 
locofocoism that I ever happened to hear, saying that nobody ought to possess 
wealth longer than his own life, and that then it should return to the people, 
etc. He says S. I---- has a great fund of traditions about the family, which 
she learned from her mother or grandmother (I forget which), one of them being 
a Hawthorne. The old lady was a very proud woman, and, as E---- says, 
&quot;proud of being proud,&quot; and so is S. I----.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><em>October</em> 7<em>th.</em>--A walk in Northfields in the afternoon. 
Bright sunshine and autumnal warmth, giving a sensation quite unlike the same 
degree of warmth in summer. Oaks,--some brown, some reddish, some still green; 
walnuts, yellow,--fallen leaves and acorns lying beneath; the footsteps crumple 
them in walking. In sunny spots beneath the trees, where greening grass is 
overstrewn by the dry, fallen foliage, as I passed, I disturbed multitudes of 
grasshoppers basking in the warm sunshine; and they began to hop, hop, hop, 
pattering on the dry leaves like big and heavy drops of a thunder-shower. They 
were invisible till they hopped. Boys gathering walnuts. Passed an orchard, 
where two men were gathering the apples. A wagon, with barrels, stood among the 
trees; the men's coats flung on the fence; the apples lay in heaps, and each of 
the men was up in a separate tree. They conversed together in loud voices, 
which the air caused to ring still louder, jeering each other, boasting of 
their own feats in shaking down the apples. One got into the very top of his 
tree, and gave a long and mighty shake, and the big apples came down&nbsp;
thump, thump, bushels hitting on the ground at once. &quot;There! did you ever 
hear anything like that?&quot; cried he. This sunny scene was pretty. A horse 
feeding apart, belonging to the wagon. The barberry-bushes have some red fruit 
on them, but they are frost-bitten. The rose-bushes have their scarlet hips.</p>
<p>Distant clumps of trees, now that the variegated foliage adorns them, have 
a phantasmagorian, an apparition-like appearance. They seem to be of some 
kindred to the crimson and gold cloud-islands. It would not be strange to see 
phantoms peeping forth from their recesses. When the sun was almost below the 
horizon, his rays, gilding the upper branches of a yellow walnut-tree, had an 
airy and beautiful effect,--the gentle contrast between the tint of the yellow 
in the shade and its ethereal gold in the fading sunshine. The woods that crown 
distant uplands were seen to great advantage in these last rays, for the 
sunshine perfectly marked out and distinguished every shade of color, 
varnishing them as it were; while the country round, both hill and plain, being 
in gloomy shadow, the woods looked the brighter for it.</p> 
<p>The tide, being high, had flowed almost into the Cold Spring, so its small 
current hardly issued forth from the basin. As I approached, two little eels, 
about as long as my finger, and slender in proportion, wriggled out of the 
basin. They had come from the salt water. An Indian-corn field, as yet 
unharvested,--huge, golden pumpkins scattered among the hills of corn,--a 
noble-looking fruit. After the sun was down, the sky was deeply dyed with a 
broad sweep of gold, high towards the zenith; not flaming brightly, but of a 
somewhat dusky gold. A piece of water, extending towards the west, between high 
banks, caught the&nbsp;reflection, and appeared like a sheet of brighter and 
more glistening gold than the sky which made it bright.</p> 
<p>Dandelions and blue flowers are still growing in sunny places. Saw in a 
barn a prodigious treasure of onions in their silvery coats, exhaling a 
penetrating perfume.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>How exceeding bright looks the sunshine, casually reflected from a 
looking-glass into a gloomy region of the chamber, distinctly marking out the 
figures and colors of the paper-hangings, which are scarcely seen elsewhere. It 
is like the light of mind thrown on an obscure subject.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Man's finest workmanship, the closer you observe it, the more imperfections 
it shows; as in a piece of polished steel a microscope will discover a rough 
surface. Whereas, what may look coarse and rough in Nature's workmanship will 
show an infinitely minute perfection, the closer you look into it. The reason 
of the minute superiority of Nature's work over man's is, that the former works 
from the innermost germ, while the latter works merely superficially.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Standing in the cross-road that leads by the Mineral Spring, and looking 
towards an opposite shore of the lake, an ascending bank, with a dense border 
of trees, green, yellow, red, russet, all bright colors, brightened by the mild 
brilliancy of the descending sun; it was strange to recognize the sober old 
friends of spring and summer in this new dress. By the by, a pretty riddle or 
fable might be made out of the changes in apparel of the familiar trees round a
&nbsp;house adapted for children. But in the lake, beneath the aforesaid border 
of trees,--the water being not rippled, but its grassy surface somewhat moved 
and shaken by the remote agitation of a breeze that was breathing on the outer 
lake,--this being in a sort of bay,--in the slightly agitated mirror, the 
variegated trees were reflected dreamily and indistinctly; a broad belt of 
bright and diversified colors shining in the water beneath. Sometimes the image 
of a tree might be almost traced; then nothing but this sweep of broken 
rainbow. It was like the recollection of the real scene in an observer's 
mind,--a confused radiance.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>A whirlwind, whirling the dried leaves round in a circle, not very 
violently.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>To well consider the characters of a family of persons in a certain 
condition,--in poverty, for instance,--and endeavor to judge how an altered 
condition would affect the character of each.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The aromatic odor of peat-smoke in the sunny autumnal air is very pleasant.
</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><em>Salem, October</em> 14<em>th.</em>--A walk through Beverly to Browne's 
Hill, and home by the iron-factory. A bright, cool afternoon. The trees, in a 
large part of the space through which I passed, appeared to be in their fullest 
glory, bright red, yellow, some of a tender green, appearing at a distance as 
if bedecked with new foliage, though this emerald tint was likewise the effect 
of frost. In some places, large tracts of ground were covered as with a scarlet 
cloth,--the underbrush being thus colored. The general character of these&nbsp;
autumnal colors is not gaudy, scarcely gay; there is something too deep and 
rich in it: it is gorgeous and magnificent, but with a sobriety diffused. The 
pastures at the foot of Browne's Hill were plentifully covered with 
barberry-bushes, the leaves of which were reddish, and they were hung with a 
prodigious quantity of berries. From the summit of the hill, looking down a 
tract of woodland at a considerable distance, so that the interstices between 
the trees could not be seen, their tops presented an unbroken level, and seemed 
somewhat like a richly variegated carpet. The prospect from the hill is wide 
and interesting; but methinks it is pleasanter in the more immediate vicinity 
of the hill than miles away. It is agreeable to look down at the square patches 
of cornfield, or of potato-ground, or of cabbages still green, or of beets 
looking red,--all a man's farm, in short,--each portion of which he considers 
separately so important, while you take in the whole at a glance. Then to cast 
your eye over so many different establishments at once and rapidly compare 
them,--here a house of gentility, with shady old yellow-leaved elms hanging 
around it; there a new little white dwelling; there an old farm-house; to see 
the barns and sheds and all the out-houses clustered together; to comprehend 
the oneness and exclusiveness and what constitutes the peculiarity of each of 
so many establishments, and to have in your mind a multitude of them, each of 
which is the most important part of the world to those who live in it,--this 
really enlarges the mind, and you come down the hill somewhat wiser than you go 
up. Pleasant to look over an orchard far below, and see the trees, each casting 
its own shadow; the white spires of meeting-houses; a sheet of water, partly 
seen among&nbsp;swelling lands. This Browne's Hill is a long ridge, lying in 
the midst of a large, level plain; it looks at a distance somewhat like a 
whale, with its head and tail under water, but its immense back protruding, 
with steep sides, and a gradual curve along its length. When you have climbed 
it on one side, and gaze from the summit at the other, you feel as if you had 
made a discovery,--the landscape being quite different on the two sides. The 
cellar of the house which formerly crowned the hill, and used to be named 
Browne's Folly, still remains, two grass-grown and shallow hollows, on the 
highest part of the ridge. The house consisted of two wings, each perhaps sixty 
feet in length, united by a middle part, in which was the entrance-hall, and 
which looked lengthwise along the hill. The foundation of a spacious porch may 
be traced on either side of the central portion; some of the stones still 
remain; but even where they are gone, the line of the porch is still traceable 
by the greener verdure. In the cellar, or rather in the two cellars, grow one 
or two barberry-bushes, with frost-bitten fruit; there is also yarrow with its 
white flower, and yellow dandelions. The cellars are still deep enough to 
shelter a person, all but his head at least, from the wind on the summit of the 
hill; but they are all grass-grown. A line of trees seems to have been planted 
along the ridge of the bill. The edifice must have made quite a magnificent 
appearance.</p> 
<p>Characteristics during the walk--Apple-trees with only here and there an 
apple on the boughs, among the thinned leaves, the relics of a gathering. In 
others you observe a rustling, and see the boughs shaking and hear the apples 
thumping down, without seeing the person who does it. Apples scattered by the
&nbsp;wayside, some with pieces bitten out, others entire, which you pick up 
and taste, and find them harsh, crabbed cider-apples, though they have a 
pretty, waxen appearance. In sunny spots of woodland, boys in search of nuts, 
looking picturesque among the scarlet and golden foliage. There is something in 
this sunny autumnal atmosphere that gives a peculiar effect to laughter and 
joyous voices,--it makes them infinitely more elastic and gladsome than at 
other seasons. Heaps of dry leaves tossed together by the wind, as if for a 
couch and lounging-place for the weary traveller, while the sun is warming it 
for him. Golden pumpkins and squashes, heaped in the angle of a house till they 
reach the lower windows. Ox-teams, laden with a rustling load of Indian corn, 
in the stalk and ear. When an inlet of the sea runs far up into the country, 
you stare to see a large schooner appear amid the rural landscape; she is 
unloading a cargo of wood, moist with rain or salt water that has dashed over 
it. Perhaps you hear the sound of an axe in the woodland; occasionally, the 
report of a fowling-piece. The travellers in the early part of the afternoon 
look warm and comfortable as if taking a summer drive; but as eve draws nearer, 
you meet them well wrapped in topcoats or cloaks, or rough, great surtouts, and 
red-nosed withal, seeming to take no great comfort, but pressing homeward. The 
characteristic conversation among teamsters and country squires, where the 
ascent of a hill causes the chaise to go at the same pace as an 
ox-team,--perhaps discussing the qualities of a yoke of oxen. The cold, blue 
aspects of sheets of water. Some of the country shops with the doors closed; 
others still open as in summer. I meet a wood-sawyer, with his horse and saw on 
his shoulders, returning from&nbsp;work. As night draws on, you begin to see 
the gleaming of fires on the ceilings in the houses which you pass. The 
comfortless appearance of houses at bleak and bare spots,--you wonder how there 
can be any enjoyment in them. I meet a girl in a chintz gown, with a small 
shawl on her shoulders, white stockings, and summer morocco shoes,--it looks 
observable. Turkeys, queer, solemn objects, in black attire, grazing about, and 
trying to peck the fallen apples, which slip away from their bills.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><em>October</em> 16<em>th.</em>--Spent the whole afternoon in a ramble to 
the sea-shore, near Phillips's Beach. A beautiful, warm, sunny afternoon, the 
very pleasantest day, probably, that there has been in the whole course of the 
year. People at work, harvesting, without their coats. Cocks, with their squad 
of hens, in the grass-fields, hunting grasshoppers, chasing them eagerly with 
outspread wings, appearing to take much interest in the sport, apart from the 
profit. Other hens picking up the ears of Indian corn. Grasshoppers, flies, and 
flying insects of all sorts are more abundant in these warm autumnal days than 
I have seen them at any other time. Yellow butterflies flutter about in the 
sunshine, singly, by pairs, or more, and are wafted on the gentle gales. The 
crickets begin to sing early in the afternoon, and sometimes a locust may be 
heard. In some warm spots, a pleasant buzz of many insects.</p> 
<p>Crossed the fields near Brookhouse's villa, and came upon a long beach,--at 
least a mile long, I should think,--terminated by craggy rocks at either end, 
and backed by a high broken bank, the grassy summit of which, year by year, is 
continually breaking away,&nbsp;and precipitated to the bottom. At the foot of 
the bank, in some parts, is a vast number of pebbles and paving-stones, rolled 
up thither by the sea long ago. The beach is of a brown sand, with hardly any 
pebbles intermixed upon it. When the tide is part way down, there is a margin 
of several yards from the water's edge, along the whole mile length of the 
beach, which glistens like a mirror, and reflects objects, and shines bright in 
the sunshine, the sand being wet to that distance from the water. Above this 
margin the sand is not wet, and grows less and less damp the farther towards 
the bank you keep. In some places your footstep is perfectly implanted, showing 
the whole shape, and the square toe, and every nail in the heel of your boot. 
Elsewhere, the impression is imperfect, and even when you stamp, you cannot 
imprint the whole. As you tread, a dry spot flashes around your step, and grows 
moist as you lift your foot again. Pleasant to pass along this extensive walk, 
watching the surf-wave;--how sometimes it seems to make a feint of breaking, 
but dies away ineffectually, merely kissing the strand; then, after many such 
abortive efforts, it gathers itself, and forms a high wall, and rolls onward, 
heightening and heightening without foam at the summit of the green line, and 
at last throws itself fiercely on the beach, with a loud roar, the spray flying 
above. As you walk along, you are preceded by a flock of twenty or thirty beach 
birds, which are seeking, I suppose, for food on the margin of the surf, yet 
seem to be merely sporting, chasing the sea as it retires, and running up 
before the impending wave. Sometimes they let it bear them off their feet, and 
float lightly on its breaking summit; sometimes they flutter and seem to rest
&nbsp;on the feathery spray. They are little birds with gray backs and 
snow-white breasts; their images may be seen in the wet sand almost or quite as 
distinctly as the reality. Their legs are long. As you draw near, they take a 
flight of a score of yards or more, and then recommence their dalliance with 
the surf-wave. You may behold their multitudinous little tracks all along your 
way. Before you reach the end of the beach, you become quite attached to these 
little sea-birds, and take much interest in their occupations. After passing in 
one direction, it is pleasant then to retrace your footsteps. Your tracks being 
all traceable, you may recall the whole mood and occupation of your mind during 
your first passage. Here you turned somewhat aside to pick up a shell that you 
saw nearer the water's edge. Here you examined a long sea-weed, and trailed its 
length after you for a considerable distance. Here the effect of the wide sea 
struck you suddenly. Here you fronted the ocean, looking at a sail, distant in 
the sunny blue. Here you looked at some plant on the bank. Here some vagary of 
mind seems to have bewildered you; for your tracks go round and round, and 
interchange each other without visible reason. Here you picked up pebbles and 
skipped them upon the water. Here you wrote names and drew faces with a razor 
sea-shell in the sand.</p> 
<p>After leaving the beach, clambered over crags, all shattered and tossed 
about everyhow; in some parts curiously worn and hollowed out, almost into 
caverns. The rock, shagged with sea-weed,--in some places, a thick carpet of 
seaweed laid over the pebbles, into which your foot would sink. Deep tanks 
among these rocks, which the sea replenishes at high tide, and then&nbsp;leaves 
the bottom all covered with various sorts of sea-plants, as if it were some 
sea-monster's private garden. I saw a crab in one of them; five-fingers too. 
From the edge of the rocks, you may look off into deep, deep water, even at low 
tide. Among the rocks, I found a great bird, whether a wild-goose, a loon, or 
an albatross, I scarcely know. It was in such a position that I almost fancied 
it might be asleep, and therefore drew near softly, lest it should take flight; 
but it was dead, and stirred not when I touched it. Sometimes a dead fish was 
cast up. A ledge of rocks, with a beacon upon it, looking like a monument 
erected to those who have perished by shipwreck. The smoked, extempore 
fire-place, where a party cooked their fish. About midway on the beach, a 
fresh-water brooklet flows towards the sea. Where it leaves the land, it is 
quite a rippling little current; but, in flowing across the sand, it grows 
shallower and more shallow, and at last is quite lost, and dies in the effort 
to carry its little tribute to the main.</p>

in the vicinity of Lockport and Niagara Falls, and elsewhere in New York. I

<h3>[1838]</h3> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><em>May</em> 11, 1838.--At Boston last week. Items:--A young man, with a 
small mustache, dyed brown, reddish from its original light color. He walks 
with an affected gait, his arms crooked outwards, treading much on his toes. 
His conversation is about the theatre, where he has a season ticket,--about an 
amateur who lately appeared there, and about actresses, with other theatrical 
scandal.--In the smoking-room, two checker and backgammon boards; the landlord 
a great player, seemingly a stupid man, but with considerable shrewdness and 
knowledge of the world.-- F----, the comedian, a stout, heavy-looking 
Englishman, of grave deportment, with no signs of wit or humor, yet aiming at 
both in conversation, in order to support his character. Very steady and 
regular in his life, and parsimonious in his disposition,--worth $50,000, made 
by his profession.--A clergyman, elderly, with a white neck-cloth, very 
unbecoming, an unworldly manner, unacquaintance with the customs of the house, 
and learning them in a childlike way. A ruffle to his shirt, crimped.--A 
gentleman, young, handsome, and sea-flushed, belonging to Oswego, New York, but 
just arrived in port from the Mediterranean: he inquires of me about the 
troubles in Canada, which were first beginning to make a noise when he left the 
country,--whether they are all over. I tell him all is finished, except the 
hanging of the prisoners. Then we talk over the matter, and I tell him the 
fates of the principal men,--some banished to New South Wales, one hanged, 
others in prison, others, conspicuous at first, now almost 
forgotten.--Apartments of private families in the hotel,--what sort of 
domesticity there may be in them; eating in public, with no board of their own. 
The gas that lights the rest&nbsp;of the house lights them also, in the 
chandelier from the ceiling.--A shabby-looking man, quiet, with spectacles, at 
first wearing an old, coarse brown frock, then appearing in a suit of elderly 
black, saying nothing unless spoken to, but talking intelligently when 
addressed. He is an editor, and I suppose printer, of a country paper. Among 
the guests, he holds intercourse with gentlemen of much more respectable 
appearance than himself, from the same part of the country.--Bill of fare; 
wines printed on the back, but nobody calls for a bottle. Chairs turned down 
for expected guests. Three-pronged steel forks. Cold supper from nine to eleven 
P.M. Great, round, mahogany table, in the sitting-room, covered with papers. In 
the morning, before and soon after breakfast, gentlemen reading the morning 
papers, while others wait for their chance, or try to pick out something from 
the papers of yesterday or longer ago. In the forenoon, the Southern papers are 
brought in, and thrown damp and folded on the table. The eagerness with which 
those who happen to be in the room start up and make prize of them. Play-bills, 
printed on yellow paper, laid upon the table. Towards evening comes the 
&quot;Transcript.&quot;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><em>June</em> 15<em>th.</em>--The red light which the sunsets at this 
season diffuse; there being showery afternoons, but the sun setting bright amid 
clouds, and diffusing its radiance over those that are scattered in masses all 
over the sky. It gives a rich tinge to all objects, even to those of sombre 
hues, yet without changing the hues. The complexions of people are exceedingly 
enriched by it; they look warm, and kindled with a mild fire. The whole scenery 
and personages acquire,&nbsp;methinks, a passionate character. A love-scene 
should be laid on such an evening. The trees and the grass have now the 
brightest possible green, there having been so many showers alternating with 
such powerful sunshine. There are roses and tulips and honeysuckles, with their 
sweet perfume; in short, the splendor of a more gorgeous climate than ours 
might be brought into the picture.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The situation of a man in the midst of a crowd, yet as completely in the 
power of another, life and all, as if they two were in the deepest solitude.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><em>Tremont, Boston,</em> June 16<em>th.</em>--Tremendously hot weather 
to-day. Went on board the Cyane to see Bridge, the purser. Took boat from the 
end of Long Wharf, with two boatmen who had just landed a man. Row round to the 
starboard side of the sloop, where we pass up the steps, and are received by 
Bridge, who introduces us to one of the lieutenants,--Hazard. Sailors and 
midshipmen scattered about,--the middies having a foul anchor, that is, an 
anchor with a cable twisted round it, embroidered on the collars of their 
jackets. The officers generally wear blue jackets, with lace on the shoulders, 
white pantaloons, and cloth caps. Introduced into the cabin,--a handsome room, 
finished with mahogany, comprehending the width of the vessel; a sideboard with 
liquors, and above it a looking-glass; behind the cabin, an inner room, in 
which is seated a lady, waiting for the captain to come on board; on each side 
of this inner cabin, a large and convenient state-room with bed,--the doors 
opening into the cabin. This cabin is on a level with the quarter-deck, and is 
covered by the poop-deck. Going&nbsp;down below stairs, you come to the 
ward-room, a pretty large room, round which are the state-rooms of the 
lieutenants, the purser, surgeon, etc. A stationary table. The ship's main-mast 
comes down through the middle of the room, and Bridge's chair, at dinner, is 
planted against it. Wine and brandy produced; and Bridge calls to the Doctor to 
drink with him, who answers affirmatively from his state-room, and shortly 
after opens the door and makes his appearance. Other officers emerge from the 
side of the vessel, or disappear into it, in the same way. Forward of the 
wardroom, adjoining it, and on the same level, is the midshipmen's room, on the 
larboard side of the vessel, not partitioned off, so as to be shut up. On a 
shelf a few books; one midshipman politely invites us to walk in; another sits 
writing. Going farther forward, on the same level, we come to the crew's 
department, part of which is occupied by the cooking-establishment, where all 
sorts of cooking is going on for the officers and men. Through the whole of 
this space, ward-room and all, there is barely room to stand upright, without 
the hat on. The rules of the quarterdeck (which extends aft from the main-mast) 
are, that the midshipmen shall not presume to walk on the starboard side of it, 
nor the men to come upon it at all, unless to speak to an officer. The 
poop-deck is still more sacred,--the lieutenants being confined to the larboard 
side, and the captain alone having a right to the starboard. A marine was 
pacing the poop-deck, being the only guard that I saw stationed in the 
vessel,--the more stringent regulations being relaxed while she is preparing 
for sea. While standing on the quarter-deck, a great piping at the gangway, and 
the second cutter comes alongside, bringing the consul&nbsp;and some other 
gentleman to visit the vessel. After a while, we are rowed ashore with them, in 
the same boat. Its crew are new hands, and therefore require much instruction 
from the cockswain. We are seated under an awning. The guns of the Cyane are 
medium thirty-two pounders; some of them have percussion locks.</p> 
<p>At the Tremont, I had Bridge to dine with me: iced champagne, claret in 
glass pitchers. Nothing very remarkable among the guests. A wine-merchant, 
French apparently, though he had arrived the day before in a bark from 
Copenhagen: a somewhat corpulent gentleman, without so good manners as an 
American would have in the same line of life, but good-natured, sociable, and 
civil, complaining of the heat. He had rings on his fingers of great weight of 
metal, and one of them had a seal for letters; brooches at the bosom, three in 
a row, up and down; also a gold watch-guard, with a seal appended. Talks of the 
comparative price of living, of clothes, etc., here and in Europe. Tells of the 
prices of wines by the cask and pipe. Champagne, he says, is drunk of better 
quality here than where it grows.--A vendor of patent medicines, Doctor Jaques, 
makes acquaintance with me, and shows me his recommendatory letters in favor of 
himself and drugs, signed by a long list of people. He prefers, he says, 
booksellers to druggists as his agents, and inquired of me about them in this 
town. He seems to be an honest man enough, with an intelligent face, and 
sensible in his talk, but not a gentleman, wearing a somewhat shabby brown coat 
and mixed pantaloons, being ill-shaven, and apparently not well acquainted with 
the customs of a fashionable hotel. A simplicity about him that is likable,
&nbsp;though, I believe, he comes from Philadelphia.--Naval officers, strolling 
about town, bargaining for swords and belts, and other military articles; with 
the tailor, to have naval buttons put on their shore-going coats, and for their 
pantaloons, suited to the climate of the Mediterranean. It is the almost 
invariable habit of officers, when going ashore or staying on shore, to divest 
themselves of all military or naval insignia, and appear as private citizens. 
At the Tremont, young gentlemen with long earlocks,--straw hats, light, or 
dark-mixed.--The theatre being closed, the play-bills of many nights ago are 
posted up against its walls.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><em>July</em> 4<em>th.</em>--A very hot, bright, sunny day; town much 
thronged; booths on the Common, selling gingerbread, sugar-plums, and 
confectionery, spruce beer, lemonade. Spirits forbidden, but probably sold 
stealthily. On the top of one of the booths a monkey, with a tail two or three 
feet long. He is fastened by a cord, which, getting tangled with the flag over 
the booth, he takes hold and tries to free it. He is the object of much 
attention from the crowd, and played with by the boys, who toss up gingerbread 
to him, while he nibbles and throws it down again. He reciprocates notice, of 
some kind or other, with all who notice him. There is a sort of gravity about 
him. A boy pulls his long tail, whereat he gives a slight squeak, and for the 
future elevates it as much as possible. Looking at the same booth by and by, I 
find that the poor monkey has been obliged to betake himself to the top of one 
of the wooden joists that stick up high above. There are boys going about with 
molasses candy, almost melted down in the sun. Shows: A mammoth rat; a 
collection of pirates, murderers, and the like, in&nbsp;wax. Constables in 
considerable number, parading about with their staves, sometimes conversing 
with each other, producing an effect by their presence, without having to 
interfere actively. One or two old salts, rather the worse for liquor: in 
general the people are very temperate. At evening the effect of things rather 
more picturesque; some of the booth-keepers knocking down the temporary 
structures, and putting the materials in wagons to carry away; other booths 
lighted up, and the lights gleaming through rents in the sail-cloth tops. The 
customers are rather riotous, calling loudly and whimsically for what they 
want; a young fellow and a girl coming arm in arm; two girls approaching the 
booth, and getting into conversation with the folks thereabout. Perchance a 
knock-down between two half-sober fellows in the crowd: a knock-down without a 
heavy blow, the receiver being scarcely able to keep his footing at any rate. 
Shoutings and hallooings, laughter, oaths,--generally a good-natured tumult; 
and the constables use no severity, but interfere, if at all, in a friendly 
sort of way. I talk with one about the way in which the day has passed, and he 
bears testimony to the orderliness of the crowd, but suspects one booth of 
selling liquor, and relates one scuffle. There is a talkative and witty seller 
of gingerbread holding forth to the people from his cart, making himself quite 
a noted character by his readiness of remark and humor, and disposing of all 
his wares. Late in the evening, during the fire-works, people are consulting 
how they are to get home,--many having long miles to walk: a father, with wife 
and children, saying it will be twelve o'clock before they reach home, the 
children being already tired to death. The moon beautifully dark-bright, not 
giving&nbsp;so white a light as sometimes. The girls all look beautiful and 
fairy-like in it, not exactly distinct, nor yet dim. The different characters 
of female countenances during the day,--mirthful and mischievous, slyly 
humorous, stupid, looking genteel generally, but when they speak often 
betraying plebeianism by the tones of their voices. Two girls are very 
tired,--one a pale, thin, languid-looking creature; the other plump, rosy, 
rather overburdened with her own little body. Gingerbread figures, in the shape 
of Jim Crow and other popularities.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>In the old burial ground, Charter Street, a slate gravestone, carved round 
the borders, to the memory of &quot;Colonel John Hathorne, Esq.,&quot; who died 
in 1717. This was the witch-judge. The stone is sunk deep into the earth, and 
leans forward, and the grass grows very long around it; and, on account of the 
moss, it was rather difficult to make out the date. Other Hathornes lie buried 
in a range with him on either side. In a corner of the burial-ground, close 
under Dr. P----'s garden fence, are the most ancient stones remaining in the 
graveyard; moss-grown, deeply sunken. One to &quot;Dr. John Swinnerton, 
Physician,&quot; in 1688; another to his wife. There, too, is the grave of 
Nathaniel Mather, the younger brother of Cotton, and mentioned in the Magnalia 
as a hard student, and of great promise. &quot;An aged man at nineteen 
years,&quot; saith the gravestone. It affected me deeply, when I had cleared 
away the grass from the half-buried stone, and read the name. An apple-tree or 
two hang over these old graves, and throw down the blighted fruit on Nathaniel 
Mather's grave,--he blighted too. It gives strange ideas, to think how&nbsp;
convenient to Dr. P----'s family this burial-ground is,--the monuments standing 
almost within arm's reach of the side windows of the parlor,--and there being a 
little gate from the back yard through which we step forth upon those old 
graves aforesaid. And the tomb of the P. family is right in front, and close to 
the gate. It is now filled, the last being the refugee Tory, Colonel P----, and 
his wife. M. P---- has trained flowers over this tomb, on account of her 
friendly relations with Colonel P----.</p> 
<p>It is not, I think, the most ancient families that have tombs,--their 
ancestry for two or three generations having been reposited in the earth before 
such a luxury as a tomb was thought of. Men who founded families, and grew 
rich, a century or so ago, were probably the first.</p> 
<p>There is a tomb of the Lyndes, with a slab of slate affixed to the brick 
masonry on one side, and carved with a coat of arms.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><em>July</em> 10<em>th.</em>--A fishing excursion, last Saturday afternoon, 
eight or ten miles out in the harbor. A fine wind out, which died away towards 
evening, and finally became quite calm. We cooked our fish on a rock named 
&quot;Satan,&quot; about forty feet long and twenty broad, irregular in its 
shape, and of uneven surface, with pools of water here and there, left by the 
tide,--dark brown rock, or whitish; there was the excrement of sea-fowl 
scattered on it, and a few feathers. The water was deep around the rock, and 
swelling up and downward, waving the seaweed. We built two fires, which, as the 
dusk deepened, cast a red gleam over the rock and the waves, and made the sea, 
on the side away from the sunset, look dismal; but by and by&nbsp;up came the 
moon, red as a house afire, and, as it rose, it grew silvery bright, and threw 
a line of silver across the calm sea. Beneath the moon and the horizon, the 
commencement of its track of brightness, there was a cone of blackness, or of 
very black blue. It was after nine before we finished our supper, which we ate 
by firelight and moonshine, and then went aboard our decked boat again,--no 
safe achievement in our ticklish little dory. To those remaining in the boat, 
we had looked very picturesque around our fires, and on the rock above 
them,--our statues being apparently increased to the size of the sons of Anak. 
The tide, now coming up, gradually dashed over the fires we had left, and so 
the rock again became a desert. The wind had now entirely died away, leaving 
the sea smooth as glass, except a quiet swell, and we could only float along, 
as the tide bore us, almost imperceptibly. It was as beautiful a night as ever 
shone,--calm, warm, bright, the moon being at full. On one side of us was 
Marblehead light-house, on the other, Baker's Island; and both, by the 
influence of the moonlight, had a silvery hue, unlike their ruddy beacon tinge 
in dark nights. They threw long reflections across the sea, like the moon. 
There we floated slowly with the tide till about midnight, and then, the tide 
turning, we fastened our vessel to a pole, which marked a rock, so as to 
prevent being carried back by the reflux. Some of the passengers turned in 
below; some stretched themselves on deck; some walked about, smoking cigars. I 
kept the deck all night. Once there was a little cat's-paw of a breeze, 
whereupon we untied ourselves from the pole; but it almost immediately died 
away, and we were compelled to make fast again. At about two o'clock, up rose 
the&nbsp;morning-star, a round, red, fiery ball, very comparable to the moon at 
its rising, and, getting upward, it shone marvelously bright, and threw its 
long reflection into the sea, like the moon and the two light-houses. It was 
Venus, and the brightest star I ever beheld; it was in the northeast. The moon 
made but a very small circuit in the sky, though it shone all night. The aurora 
borealis shot upwards to the zenith, and between two and three o'clock the 
first streak of dawn appeared, stretching far along the edge of the eastern 
horizon,--a faint streak of light; then it gradually broadened and deepened, 
and became a rich saffron tint, with violet above, and then an ethereal and 
transparent blue. The saffron became intermixed with splendor, kindling and 
kindling, Baker's Island lights being in the centre of the brightness, so that 
they were extinguished by it, or at least grew invisible. On the other side of 
the boat, the Marblehead light-house still threw out its silvery gleam, and the 
moon shone brightly too; and its light looked very singularly, mingling with 
the growing daylight. It was not like the moonshine, brightening as the evening 
twilight deepens; for now it threw its radiance over the landscape, the green 
and other tints of which were displayed by the daylight, whereas at evening all 
those tints are obscured. It looked like a milder sunshine,--a dreamy 
sunshine,--the sunshine of a world not quite so real and material as this. All 
night we had heard the Marblehead clocks telling the hour. Anon, up came the 
sun, without any bustle, but quietly, his antecedent splendors having gilded 
the sea for some time before. It had been cold towards morning, but now grew 
warm, and gradually burning hot in the sun. A breeze sprang up, but our&nbsp;
first use of it was to get aground on Coney Island about five o'clock, where we 
lay till nine or thereabout, and then floated slowly up to the wharf. The roar 
of distant surf, the rolling of porpoises, the passing of shoals of fish, a 
steamboat smoking along at a distance, were the scene on my watch. I fished 
during the night, and, feeling something on the line, I drew up with great 
eagerness and vigor. It was two of those broad-leaved sea-weeds, with stems 
like snakes, both rooted on a stone,--all which came up together. Often these 
sea-weeds root themselves on mussels. In the morning, our pilot killed a 
flounder with the boat-hook, the poor fish thinking himself secure on the 
bottom.</p>

<p>Ladurlad, in &quot;The Curse of Kehama,&quot; on visiting a certain 
celestial region, the fire in his heart and brain died away for a season, but 
was rekindled again on returning to earth. So may it be with me in my projected 
three months' seclusion from old associations.</p>

<p>Punishment of a miser,--to pay the drafts of his heir in his tomb.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><em>July</em> 13<em>th.</em>--A show of wax-figures, consisting almost 
wholly of murderers and their victims,--Gibbs and Hansley, the pirates, and the 
Dutch girl whom Gibbs murdered. Gibbs and Hansley were admirably done, as 
natural as life; and many people who had known Gibbs would not, according to 
the showman, be convinced that this wax-figure was not his skin stuffed. The 
two pirates were represented with halters round their necks, just ready to be 
turned off; and the sheriff stood behind them, with his watch, waiting for&nbsp;
the moment. The clothes, halter, and Gibbs's hair were authentic. E. K. Avery 
and Cornell,--the former a figure in black, leaning on the back of a chair, in 
the attitude of a clergyman about to pray; an ugly devil, said to be a good 
likeness. Ellen Jewett and R. P. Robinson, she dressed richly, in extreme 
fashion, and very pretty; he awkward and stiff, it being difficult to stuff a 
figure to look like a gentleman. The showman seemed very proud of Ellen Jewett, 
and spoke of her somewhat as if this wax-figure were a real creation. Strong 
and Mrs. Whipple, who together murdered the husband of the latter. Lastly the 
Siamese twins. The showman is careful to call his exhibition the 
&quot;Statuary.&quot; He walks to and fro before the figures, talking of the 
history of the persons, the moral lessons to be drawn therefrom, and especially 
of the excellence of the wax-work. He has for sale printed histories of the 
personages. He is a friendly, easy-mannered sort of a half-genteel character, 
whose talk has been moulded by the persons who most frequent such a show; an 
air of superiority of information, a moral instructor, with a great deal of 
real knowledge of the world. He invites his departing guests to call again and 
bring their friends, desiring to know whether they are pleased; telling that he 
had a thousand people on the 4th of July, and that they were all perfectly 
satisfied. He talks with the female visitors, remarking on Ellen Jewett's 
person and dress to them, he having &quot;spared no expense in dressing her; 
and all the ladies say that a dress never set better, and he thinks he never 
knew a handsomer female.&quot; He goes to and fro, snuffing the candles, and 
now and then holding one to the face of a favorite figure. Ever and anon, 
hearing steps upon the staircase,&nbsp;he goes to admit a new visitor. The 
visitors,--a half-bumpkin, half country-squire-like man, who has something of a 
knowing air, and yet looks and listens with a good deal of simplicity and 
faith, smiling between whiles; a mechanic of the town; several decent-looking 
girls and women, who eye Ellen herself with more interest than the other 
figures,--women having much curiosity about such ladies; a gentlemanly sort of 
person, who looks somewhat ashamed of himself for being there, and glances at 
me knowingly, as if to intimate that he was conscious of being out of place; a 
boy or two, and myself, who examine wax faces and faces of flesh with equal 
interest. A political or other satire might be made by describing a show of 
wax-figures of the prominent public men; and by the remarks of the showman and 
the spectators, their characters and public standing might be expressed. And 
the incident of Judge Tyler as related by E---- might be introduced.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>A series of strange, mysterious, dreadful events to occur, wholly 
destructive of a person's happiness. He to impute them to various persons and 
causes, but ultimately finds that he is himself the sole agent. Moral, that our 
welfare depends on ourselves.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The strange incident in the court of Charles IX. of France: he and five 
other maskers being attired in coats of linen covered with pitch and bestuck 
with flax to represent hairy savages. They entered the hall dancing, the five 
being fastened together, and the king in front. By accident the five were set 
on fire with a torch. Two were burned to death on the spot, two afterwards 
died; one fled to the buttery, and&nbsp;jumped into a vessel of water. It might 
be represented as the fate of a squad of dissolute men.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>A perception, for a moment, of one's eventual and moral self, as if it were 
another person,--the observant faculty being separated, and looking intently at 
the qualities of the character. There is a surprise when this happens,--this 
getting out of one's self,--and then the observer sees how queer a fellow he is.
</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><em>July</em> 27<em>th.</em>--Left home [Salem] on the 23d instant. To 
Boston by stage, and took the afternoon cars for Worcester. A little boy 
returning from the city, several miles, with a basket of empty custard-cups, 
the contents of which he had probably sold at the depot. Stopped at the 
Temperance House. An old gentleman, Mr. Phillips, of Boston, got into 
conversation with me, and inquired very freely as to my character, tastes, 
habits, and circumstances,--a freedom sanctioned by his age, his kindly and 
beneficent spirit, and the wisdom of his advice. It is strange how little 
impertinence depends on what is actually said, but rather on the manner and 
motives of saying it. &quot;I want to do you good,&quot; said he with warmth, 
after becoming, apparently, moved by my communications. &quot;Well, sir,&quot; 
replied I, &quot;I wish you could, for both our sakes; for I have no doubt it 
would be a great satisfaction to you.&quot; He asked the most direct questions 
of another young man; for instance, &quot;Are you married?&quot; having before 
ascertained that point with regard to myself. He told me by all means to<em>act,
</em> in whatever way; observing that he himself would have no objection to be 
a servant, if no other mode of action presented itself.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The landlord of the tavern, a decent, active, grave, attentive personage, 
giving me several cards of his house to distribute on my departure. A judge, a 
stout, hearty country squire, looking elderly; a hale and rugged man, in a 
black coat, and thin, light pantaloons.</p> 
<p>Started for Northampton at half past nine in the morning. A respectable 
sort of man and his son on their way to Niagara,--grocers, I believe, and 
calculating how to perform the tour, subtracting as few days as possible from 
the shop. Somewhat inexperienced travellers, and comparing everything 
advantageously or otherwise with Boston customs; and considering themselves a 
long way from home, while yet short of a hundred miles from it. Two ladies, 
rather good-looking. I rode outside nearly all day, and was very sociable with 
the driver and another outside passenger. Towards night, took up an 
essence-vendor for a short distance. He was returning home, after having been 
out on a tour two or three weeks, and nearly exhausted his stock. He was not 
exclusively an essence-pedlar, having a large tin box, which had been filled 
with dry goods, combs, jewelry, etc., now mostly sold out. His essences were of 
aniseseed, cloves, red-cedar, wormwood, together with opodeldoc, and an oil for 
the hair. These matters are concocted at Ashfield, and the pedlars are sent 
about with vast quantities. Cologne-water is among the essences manufactured, 
though the bottles have foreign labels on them. The pedlar was good-natured and 
communicative, and spoke very frankly about his trade, which he seemed to like 
better than farming, though his experience of it is yet brief. He spoke of the 
trials of temper to which pedlars are subjected, but said that it was&nbsp;
necessary to be forbearing, because the same road must be travelled again and 
again. The pedlars find satisfaction for all contumelies in making good 
bargains out of their customers. This man was a pedlar in quite a small way, 
making but a narrow circuit, and carrying no more than an open basket full of 
essences; but some go out with wagon-loads. He himself contemplated a trip 
westward, in which case he would send on quantities of his wares ahead to 
different stations. He seemed to enjoy the intercourse and seeing of the world. 
He pointed out a rough place in the road, where his stock of essences had 
formerly been broken by a jolt of the stage. What a waste of sweet smells on 
the desert air! The essence-labels stated the efficacy of the stuffs for 
various complaints of children and grown people. The driver was an acquaintance 
of the pedlar, and so gave him his drive for nothing, though the pedlar 
pretended to wish to force some silver into his hand; and afterwards he got 
down to water the horses, while the driver was busied with other matters. This 
driver was a little, dark ragamuffin, apparently of irascible temper, speaking 
with great disapprobation of his way-bill not being timed accurately, but so as 
to make it appear as if he were longer upon the road than he was. As he spoke, 
the blood darkened in his cheek, and his eye looked ominous and angry, as if he 
were enraged with the person to whom he was speaking; yet he had not real grit, 
for he had never said a word of his grievances to those concerned. &quot;I mean 
to tell them of it by and by. I won't bear it more than three or four times 
more,&quot; said he.</p> 
<p>Left Northampton the next morning, between one and two o'clock. Three other 
passengers, whose faces&nbsp;were not visible for some hours; so we went on 
through unknown space, saying nothing, glancing forth sometimes to see the 
gleam of the lanterns on wayside objects.</p> 
<p>How very desolate looks a forest when seen in this way,--as if, should you 
venture one step within its wild, tangled, many-stemmed, and dark-shadowed 
verge, you would inevitably be lost forever. Sometimes we passed a house, or 
rumbled through a village, stopping perhaps to arouse some drowsy postmaster, 
who appeared at the door in shirt and pantaloons, yawning, received the mail, 
returned it again, and was yawning when last seen. A few words exchanged among 
the passengers, as they roused themselves from their half-slumbers, or dreamy, 
slumber-like abstraction. Meantime dawn broke, our faces became partially 
visible, the morning air grew colder, and finally cloudy day came on. We found 
ourselves driving through quite a romantic country, with hills or mountains on 
all sides, a stream on one side, bordered by a high, precipitous bank, up which 
would have grown pines, only that, losing their footholds, many of them had 
slipped downward. The road was not the safest in the world; for often the 
carriage approached within two or three feet of a precipice; but the driver, a 
merry fellow, lolled on his box, with his feet protruding horizontally, and 
rattled on at the rate of ten miles an hour. Breakfast between four and 
five,--newly caught trout, salmon, ham, boiled eggs, and other niceties,--truly 
excellent. A bunch of pickerel, intended for a tavern-keeper farther on, was 
carried by the stage-driver. The drivers carry a &quot;time-watch&quot; 
enclosed in a small wooden case, with a lock, so that it may be known in what 
time they&nbsp;perform their stages. They are allowed so many hours and minutes 
to do their work, and their desire to go as fast as possible, combined with 
that of keeping their horses in good order, produces about a right medium.</p> 
<p>One of the passengers was a young man who had been in Pennsylvania, keeping 
a school,--a genteel enough young man, but not a gentleman. He took neither 
supper nor breakfast, excusing himself from one as being weary with riding all 
day, and from the other because it was so early. He attacked me for a 
subscription for &quot;building up a destitute church,&quot; of which he had 
taken an agency, and had collected two or three hundred dollars, but wanted as 
many thousands. Betimes in the morning, on the descent of a mountain, we 
arrived at a house where dwelt the married sister of the young man, whom he was 
going to visit.</p> 
<p>He alighted, saw his trunk taken off, and then, having perceived his sister 
at the door, and turning to bid us farewell, there was a broad smile, even a 
laugh of pleasure, which did him more credit with me than anything else; for 
hitherto there had been a disagreeable scornful twist upon his face, perhaps, 
however, merely superficial. I saw, as the stage drove off, his comely sister 
approaching with a lighted-up face to greet him, and one passenger on the front 
seat beheld them meet. &quot;Is it an affectionate greeting?&quot; inquired I. 
&quot;Yes,&quot; said he, &quot;I should like to share it&quot;; whereby I 
concluded that there was a kiss exchanged.</p> 
<p>The highest point of our journey was at Windsor, where we could see leagues 
around over the mountain, a terribly bare, bleak spot, fit for nothing but 
sheep, and without shelter of woods. We rattled downward&nbsp;into a warmer 
region, beholding as we went the sun shining on portions of the landscape, 
miles ahead of us, while we were yet in chillness and gloom. It is probable 
that during a part of the stage the mists around us looked like sky clouds to 
those in the lower regions. Think of driving a stagecoach through the clouds! 
Seasonably in the forenoon we arrived at Pittsfield.</p> 
<p>Pittsfield is a large village, quite shut in by mountain walls, generally 
extending like a rampart on all sides of it, but with insulated great hills 
rising here and there in the outline. The area of the town is level; its houses 
are handsome, mostly wooden and white; but some are of brick, painted deep red, 
the bricks being not of a healthy, natural color. There are handsome churches, 
Gothic and others, and a courthouse and an academy; the court-house having a 
marble front. There is a small mall in the centre of the town, and in the 
centre of the mall rises an elm of the loftiest and straightest stem that ever 
I beheld, without a branch or leaf upon it till it has soared seventy or 
perhaps a hundred feet into the air. The top branches unfortunately have been 
shattered somehow or other, so that it does not cast a broad shade; probably 
they were broken by their own ponderous foliage. The central square of 
Pittsfield presents all the bustle of a thriving village,--the farmers of the 
vicinity in light wagons, sulkies, or on horseback; stages at the door of the 
Berkshire Hotel, under the stoop of which sit or lounge the guests, 
stage-people, and idlers, observing or assisting in the arrivals and 
departures. Huge trunks and bandboxes unladed and laded. The courtesy shown to 
ladies in aiding them to alight, in a shower, under umbrellas. The dull&nbsp;
looks of passengers, who have driven all night, scarcely brightened by the 
excitement of arriving at a new place. The stage agent demanding the names of 
those who are going on,--some to Lebanon Springs, some to Albany. The 
toddy-stick is still busy at these Berkshire public-houses. At dinner soup 
preliminary, in city style. Guests: the court people; Briggs, member of 
Congress, attending a trial here; horse-dealers, country squires, store-keepers 
in the village, etc. My room, a narrow crib overlooking a back court-yard, 
where a young man and a lad were drawing water for the maid-servants,--their 
jokes, especially those of the lad, of whose wit the elder fellow, being a 
blockhead himself, was in great admiration, and declared to another that he 
knew as much as them both. Yet he was not very witty. Once in a while the 
maid-servants would come to the door, and hear and respond to their jokes, with 
a kind of restraint, yet both permitting and enjoying them.</p> 
<p>After or about sunset there was a heavy shower, the thunder rumbling round 
and round the mountain wall, and the clouds stretching from rampart to rampart. 
When it abated, the clouds in all parts of the visible heavens were tinged with 
glory from the west; some that hung low being purple and gold, while the higher 
ones were gray. The slender curve of the new moon was also visible, brightening 
amidst the fading brightness of the sunny part of the sky. There are 
marble-quarries in and near Pittsfield, which accounts for the fact that there 
are none but marble gravestones in the burial-grounds; some of the monuments 
well carved; but the marble does not withstand the wear and tear of time and 
weather so well as the imported marble, and the sculpture soon loses its sharp 
outline. The&nbsp;door of one tomb, a wooden door, opening in the side of a 
green mound, surmounted by a marble obelisk, having been shaken from its hinges 
by the late explosion of the powder-house, and incompletely repaired, I peeped 
in at the crevices, and saw the coffins. It was the tomb of Rev. Thomas Allen, 
first minister of Pittsfield, deceased in 1810. It contained three coffins, all 
with white mould on their tops: one, a small child's, rested upon another, and 
the other was on the opposite side of the tomb, and the lid was considerably 
displaced.; but the tomb being dark, I could see neither corpse nor skeleton.
</p> 
<p>Marble also occurs here in North Adams, and thus some very ordinary houses 
have marble doorsteps, and even the stone walls are built of fragments of 
marble.</p> 
<p>Wednesday, 26th.--Left Pittsfield at about eight o'clock in the Bennington 
stage, intending to go to Williamstown. Inside passengers,--a new-married 
couple taking a jaunt. The lady, with a clear, pale complexion, and a rather 
pensive cast of countenance, slender, and with a genteel figure; the 
bridegroom, a shopkeeper in New York probably, a young man with a stout black 
beard, black eyebrows, which formed one line across his forehead. They were 
very loving; and while the stage stopped, I watched them, quite entranced in 
each other, both leaning sideways against the back of the coach, and perusing 
their mutual comeliness, and apparently making complimentary observations upon 
it to one another. The bride appeared the most absorbed and devoted, referring 
her whole being to him. The gentleman seemed in a most paradisiacal mood, 
smiling ineffably upon his bride, and, when she spoke, responding to her with a 
benign expression of&nbsp;matrimonial sweetness, and, as it were, compassion 
for the &quot;weaker vessel,&quot; mingled with great love and pleasant humor. 
It was very droll. The driver peeped into the coach once, and said that he had 
his arm round her waist. He took little freedoms with her, tapping her with his 
cane,--love-pats; and she seemed to see nothing amiss. They kept eating 
gingerbread all along the road, and dined heartily notwithstanding.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Our driver was a slender, lathe-like, round-backed, rough-bearded, 
thin-visaged, middle-aged Yankee, who became very communicative during our 
drive. He was not bred a stage-driver, but had undertaken the business 
temporarily, as a favor to his brother-in-law. He was a native of these 
Berkshire mountains, but had formerly emigrated to Ohio, and had returned for a 
time to try the benefit of her native air on his wife's declining health,--she 
having complaints of a consumptive nature. He pointed out the house where he 
was married to her, and told the name of the country squire who tied the knot. 
His wife has little or no chance of recovery, and he said he would never marry 
again,--this resolution being expressed in answer to a remark of mine relative 
to a second marriage. He has no children. I pointed to a hill at some distance 
before us, and asked what it was. &quot;That, sir,&quot; said he, &quot;is a 
very high hill. It is known by the name of Graylock.&quot; He seemed to feel 
that this was a more poetical epithet than Saddleback, which is a more usual 
name for it. Graylock, or Saddleback, is quite a respectable mountain; and I 
suppose the former name has been given to it because it often has a gray cloud, 
or lock of gray mist, upon its head. It does not ascend into a peak, but heaves 
up a round ball,&nbsp;and has supporting ridges on each side. Its summit is not 
bare, like that of Mount Washington, but covered with forests. The driver said, 
that several years since the students of Williams College erected a building 
for an observatory on the top of the mountain, and employed him to haul the 
materials for constructing it; and he was the only man who had driven an 
ox-team up Graylock. It was necessary to drive the team round and round, in 
ascending. President Griffin rode up on horseback.</p> 
<p>Along our road we passed villages, and often factories, the machinery 
whirring, and girls looking out of the windows at the stage, with heads averted 
from their tasks, but still busy. These factories have two, three, or more 
boarding-houses near them, two stories high, and of double length,--often with 
bean-vines running up round the doors, and with altogether a domestic look. 
There are several factories in different parts of North Adams, along the banks 
of a stream,--a wild, highland rivulet, which, however, does vast work of a 
civilized nature. It is strange to see such a rough and untamed stream as it 
looks to be so subdued to the purposes of man, and making cottons and woollens, 
sawing boards and marbles, and giving employment to so many men and girls. And 
there is a sort of picturesqueness in finding these factories, supremely 
artificial establishments, in the midst of such wild scenery. For now the 
stream will be flowing through a rude forest, with the trees erect and dark, as 
when the Indians fished there; and it brawls and tumbles and eddies over its 
rock-strewn current. Perhaps there is a precipice, hundreds of feet high, 
beside it, down which, by heavy rains, or the melting of snows, great 
pine-trees have slid or fallen headlong, and lie at the&nbsp;bottom, or 
half-way down, while their brethren seem to be gazing at their fall from the 
summit, and anticipating a like fate. And then, taking a turn in the road, 
behold these factories and their range of boarding-houses, with the girls 
looking out of the windows, as aforesaid! And perhaps the wild scenery is all 
around the very site of the factory, and mingles its impression strangely with 
those opposite ones. These observations were made during a walk yesterday.</p> 
<p>I bathed in a pool of the stream that was out of sight, and where its 
brawling waters were deep enough to cover me, when I lay at length. A part of 
the road along which I walked was on the edge of a precipice, falling down 
straight towards the stream; and in one place the passage of heavy loads had 
sunk it, so that soon, probably, there will be an avalanche, perhaps carrying a 
stage-coach or heavy wagon down into the bed of the river.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>I met occasional wayfarers; once two women in a cart,--decent, 
brown-visaged, country matrons,--and then an apparent doctor, of whom there are 
seven or thereabouts in North Adams; for though this vicinity is very healthy, 
yet the physicians are obliged to ride considerable distances among the 
mountain towns, and their practice is very laborious. A nod is always exchanged 
between strangers meeting on the road. This morning an underwitted old man met 
me on a walk, and held a pretty long conversation, insisting upon shaking hands 
(to which I was averse, lest his hand should not be clean), and insisting on 
his right to do so, as being &quot;a friend of mankind.&quot; He was a gray, 
bald-headed, wrinkled-visaged figure, decently dressed, with cowhide shoes, a 
coat on one arm, and an umbrella on the other, and said that he was&nbsp;going 
to see a widow in the neighborhood. Finding that I was not provided with a 
wife, he recommended a certain maiden of forty years, who had three hundred 
acres of land. He spoke of his children, who are proprietors of a circus 
establishment, and have taken a granddaughter to bring up in their way of life; 
and he gave me a message to tell them in case we should meet. While this old 
man is wandering among the hills, his children are the gaze of multitudes. He 
told me the place where he was born, directing me to it by pointing to a wreath 
of mist which lay on the side of a mountain ridge, which he termed &quot;the 
smoke yonder.&quot; Speaking of the widow, he said: &quot;My wife has been dead 
these seven years, and why should I not enjoy myself a little?&quot; His manner 
was full of quirks and quips and eccentricities, waving his umbrella, and 
gesticulating strangely, with a great deal of action. I suppose, to help his 
natural foolishness, he had been drinking. We parted, he exhorting me not to 
forget his message to his sons, and I shouting after him a request to be 
remembered to the widow. Conceive something tragical to be talked about, and 
much might be made of this interview in a wild road among the hills, with 
Graylock, at a great distance, looking sombre and angry, by reason of the gray, 
heavy mist upon his head.</p> 
<p>The morning was cloudy, and all the near landscape lay unsunned; but there 
was sunshine on distant tracts, in the valleys, and in specks upon the 
mountain-tops. Between the ridges of hills there are long, wide, deep valleys, 
extending for miles and miles, with houses scattered along them. A bulky 
company of mountains, swelling round head over round head, rises insulated by 
such broad vales from the surrounding ridges.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>I ought to have mentioned that I arrived at North Adams in the forenoon of 
the 26th, and, liking the aspect of matters indifferently well, determined to 
make my headquarters here for a short time.</p> 
<p>On the road to Northampton, we passed a tame crow, which was sitting on the 
peak of a barn. The crow flew down from its perch, and followed us a great 
distance, hopping along the road, and flying with its large, black, flapping 
wings, from post to post of the fence, or from tree to tree. At last he gave up 
the pursuit with a croak of disappointment. The driver said, perhaps correctly, 
that the crow had scented some salmon which was in a basket under the seat, and 
that this was the secret of his pursuing us. This would be a terrific incident 
if it were a dead body that the crow scented, instead of a basket of salmon. 
Suppose, for instance, in a coach travelling along, that one of the passengers 
suddenly should die, and that one of the indications of his death would be this 
deportment of the crow.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><em>July</em> 29<em>th.</em>--Remarkable characters:--A disagreeable 
figure, waning from middle age, clad in a pair of tow homespun pantaloons, and 
a very soiled shirt, barefoot, and with one of his feet maimed by an axe; also 
an arm amputated two or three inches below the elbow. His beard of a week's 
growth, grim and grisly, with a general effect of black; altogether a 
disgusting object. Yet he has the signs of having been a handsome man in his 
idea, though now such a beastly figure that probably no living thing but his 
great dog would touch him without an effort. Coming to the stoop, where several 
persons were sitting, &quot;Good morning, gentlemen,&quot; said the wretch. 
Nobody&nbsp;answered for a time, till at last one said, &quot;I don't know whom 
you speak to: not to me, I'm sure&quot; (meaning that he did not claim to be a 
gentleman). &quot;Why I thought I spoke to you all at once,&quot; replied the 
figure, laughing. So he sat himself down on the lower step of the stoop, and 
began to talk; and, the conversation being turned upon his bare feet by one of 
the company, he related the story of his losing his toes by the glancing aside 
of an axe, and with what great fortitude he bore it. Then he made a transition 
to the loss of his arm, and, setting his teeth and drawing in his breath, said 
that the pain was dreadful; but this, too, he seems to have borne like an 
Indian; and a person testified to his fortitude by saying that he did not 
suppose there was any feeling in him, from observing how he bore it. The man 
spoke of the pain of cutting the muscles, and the particular agony at one 
moment, while the bone was being sawed asunder; and there was a strange 
expression of remembered anguish, as he shrugged his half-limb, and described 
the matter. Afterwards, in a reply to a question of mine, whether he still 
seemed to feel the hand that had been amputated, he answered that he did 
always; and, baring the stump, he moved the severed muscles, saying, 
&quot;There is the thumb, there the forefinger,&quot; and so on. Then he talked 
to me about phrenology, of which he seems a firm believer and skilful 
practitioner, telling how he had hit upon the true character of many people. 
There was a great deal of sense and acuteness in his talk, and something of 
elevation in his expressions,--perhaps a studied elevation, and a sort of 
courtesy in his manner; but his sense had something out of the way in it; there 
was something wild and ruined and desperate in his talk, though I can hardly
&nbsp;say what it was. There was a trace of the gentleman and man of intellect 
through his deep degradation; and a pleasure in intellectual pursuits, and an 
acuteness and trained judgment, which bespoke a mind once strong and 
cultivated. &quot;My study is man,&quot; said he. And, looking at me, &quot;I 
do not know your name,&quot; he said, &quot;but there is something of the 
hawk-eye about you, too.&quot;</p> 
<p>This man was formerly a lawyer in good practice; but, taking to drinking, 
was reduced to the lowest state. Yet not the lowest; for after the amputation 
of his arm, being advised by divers persons to throw himself upon the public 
for support, he told them that, even if he should lose his other arm, he would 
still be able to support himself and a servant. Certainly he is a strong-minded 
and iron-constitutioned man; but, looking at the stump of his arm, he said that 
the pain of the mind was a thousand times greater than the pain of the body. 
&quot;That hand could make the pen go fast,&quot; said he. Among people in 
general, he does not seem to have any greater consideration in his ruin because 
of his former standing in society. He supports himself by making soap; and, on 
account of the offals used in that business, there is probably rather an evil 
odor in his domicile. Talking about a dead horse near his house, he said that 
he could not bear the scent of it. &quot;I should not think you could smell 
carrion in<em>that</em> house,&quot; said a stage agent. Whereupon the 
soap-maker dropped his head, with a little snort, as it were, of wounded 
feeling; but immediately said that he took all in good part. There was an old 
squire of the village, a lawyer probably, whose demeanor was different,--with a 
distance, yet with a kindliness; for he remembered the times when they&nbsp;met 
on equal terms. &quot;You and I,&quot; said the squire, alluding to their 
respective troubles and sicknesses, &quot;would have died long ago, if we had 
not had the courage to live.&quot; The poor devil kept talking to me long after 
everybody else had left the stoop, giving vent to much practical philosophy, 
and just observation on the ways of men, mingled with rather more assumption of 
literature and cultivation than belonged to the present condition of his mind. 
Meantime his great dog, a cleanly looking and not ill-bred dog, being the only 
decent attribute appertaining to his master,--a well-natured dog, too, and 
receiving civilly any demonstration of courtesy from other people, though 
preserving a certain distance of deportment,--this great dog grew weary of his 
master's lengthy talk, and expressed his impatience to be gone by thrusting 
himself between his legs, rolling over on his back, seizing his ragged 
trousers, or playfully taking his maimed, bare foot into his mouth,--using, in 
short, the kindly and humorous freedom of a friend, with a wretch to whom all 
are free enough, but none other kind. His master rebuked him, but with kindness 
too, and not so that the dog felt himself bound to desist, though he seemed 
willing to allow his master all the time that could possibly be spared. And at 
last, having said many times that he must go and shave and dress himself,--and 
as his beard had been at least a week growing, it might have seemed almost a 
week's work to get rid of it,--he rose from the stoop and went his way,--a 
forlorn and miserable thing in the light of the cheerful summer morning. Yet he 
seems to keep his spirits up, and still preserves himself a man among men, 
asking nothing from them; nor is it clearly perceptible what right they have to 
scorn him, though he seems to acquiesce, in a manner, in their doing so. And 
yet he cannot wholly have lost his self-respect; and doubtless there were 
persons on the stoop more grovelling than himself.</p> 
<p>Another character:--A blacksmith of fifty or upwards, a corpulent figure, 
big in the paunch and enormous in the rear; yet there is such an appearance of 
strength and robustness in his frame, that his corpulence appears very proper 
and necessary to him. A pound of flesh could not be spared from his abundance, 
any more than from the leanest man; and he walks about briskly, without any 
panting or symptom of labor or pain in his motion. He has a round, jolly face, 
always mirthful and humorous and shrewd, and the air of a man well to do, and 
well respected, yet not caring much about the opinions of men, because his 
independence is sufficient to itself. Nobody would take him for other than a 
man of some importance in the community, though his summer dress is a tow-cloth 
pair of pantaloons, a shirt not of the cleanest, open at the breast, and the 
sleeves rolled up at the elbows, and a straw hat. There is not such a vast 
difference between this costume and that of Lawyer H---- above mentioned, yet 
never was there a greater diversity of appearance than between these two men; 
and a glance at them would be sufficient to mark the difference. The blacksmith 
loves his glass, and comes to the tavern for it, whenever it seems good to him, 
not calling for it slyly and shyly, but marching steadily to the bar, or 
calling across the room for it to be prepared. He speaks with great bitterness 
against the new license law, and vows if it be not repealed by fair means it 
shall be by violence, and that he will be as ready to cock his rifle for such a 
cause as for any&nbsp;other. On this subject his talk is really fierce; but as 
to all other matters he is good-natured and good-hearted, fond of joke, and 
shaking his jolly sides with frequent laughter. His conversation has much 
strong, unlettered sense, imbued with humor, as everybody's talk is in New 
England.</p> 
<p>He takes a queer position sometimes,--queer for his figure 
particularly,--straddling across a chair, facing the back, with his arms 
resting thereon, and his chin on them, for the benefit of conversing closely 
with some one. When he has spent as much time in the bar-room or under the 
stoop as he chooses to spare, he gets up at once, and goes off with a brisk, 
vigorous pace. He owns a mill, and seems to be prosperous in the world. I know 
no man who seems more like a man, more indescribably human, than this sturdy 
blacksmith.</p> 
<p>There came in the afternoon a respectable man in gray homespun cloth, who 
arrived in a wagon, I believe, and began to inquire, after supper, about a 
certain new kind of mill machinery. Being referred to the blacksmith, who owned 
one of these mills, the stranger said that he had come from Vermont to learn 
about the matter. &quot;What may I call your name?&quot; said he to the 
blacksmith. &quot;My name is Hodge,&quot; replied the latter. &quot;I believe I 
have heard of you,&quot; said the stranger. Then they colloquied at much length 
about the various peculiarities and merits of the new invention. The stranger 
continued here two or three days, making his researches, and forming 
acquaintance with several millwrights and others. He was a man evidently of 
influence in his neighborhood, and the tone of his conversation was in the 
style of one accustomed to be heard with deference, though all&nbsp;in a plain 
and homely way. Lawyer H---- took notice of this manner; for the talk being 
about the nature of soap, and the evil odor arising from that process, the 
stranger joined in. &quot;There need not be any disagreeable smell in making 
soap,&quot; said he. &quot;Now we are to receive a lesson,&quot; said H----, 
and the remark was particularly apropos to the large wisdom of the stranger's 
tone and air.</p> 
<p>Then he gave an account of the process in his domestic establishment, 
saying that he threw away the whole offals of the hog, as not producing any 
soap, and preserved the skins of the intestines for sausages. He seemed to be 
hospitable, inviting those with whom he did business to take &quot;a mouthful 
of dinner&quot; with him, and treating them with liquors; for he was not an 
utter temperance man, though moderate in his potations. I suspect he would turn 
out a pattern character of the upper class of New England yeomen, if I had an 
opportunity of studying him. Doubtless he had been selectman, representative, 
and justice, and had filled all but weighty offices. He was highly pleased with 
the new mill contrivance, and expressed his opinion that, when his neighbors 
saw the success of his, it would be extensively introduced into that vicinity.

<p><em>Mem.</em> The hostlers at taverns call the money given them 
&quot;pergasus,&quot;--corrupted from &quot;perquisites.&quot; Otherwise 
&quot;knock-down money.&quot;</p> 
<p>Remarkable character:--A travelling surgeon-dentist, who has taken a room 
in the North Adams House, and sticks up his advertising bills on the pillars of 
the piazza, and all about the town. He is a tall, slim young man, six feet two, 
dressed in a country-made coat of light blue (taken, as he tells me, in 
exchange for dental operations), black pantaloons, and clumsy,&nbsp;cowhide 
boots. Self-conceit is very strongly expressed in his air; and a doctor once 
told him that he owed his life to that quality; for, by keeping himself so 
stiffly upright, he opens his chest, and counteracts a consumptive tendency. He 
is not only a dentist, which trade he follows temporarily, but a licensed 
preacher of the Baptist persuasion, and is now on his way to the West to seek a 
place of settlement in his spiritual vocation. Whatever education he possesses, 
he has acquired by his own exertions since the age of twenty-one,--he being now 
twenty-four. We talk together very freely; and he has given me an account, 
among other matters, of all his love-affairs, which are rather curious, as 
illustrative of the life of a smart young country fellow in relation to the 
gentle sex. Nothing can exceed the exquisite self-conceit which characterizes 
these confidences, and which is expressed inimitably in his face, his upturned 
nose, and mouth, so as to be truly a caricature; and he seems strangely to find 
as much food for his passion in having been jilted once or twice as in his 
conquests. It is curious to notice his revengeful feeling against the false 
ones,--hidden from himself, however, under the guise of religious interest, and 
desire that they may be cured of their follies.</p> 
<p>A little boy named Joe, who haunts about the bar-room and the stoop, four 
years old, in a thin, short jacket, and full-breeched trousers, and bare feet. 
The men tease him, and put quids of tobacco in his mouth, under pretence of 
giving him a fig; and he gets enraged, and utters a peculiar, sharp, spiteful 
cry, and strikes at them with a stick, to their great mirth. He is always in 
trouble, yet will not keep away. They despatch him with two or three cents to 
buy candy&nbsp;and nuts and raisins. They set him down in a niche of the door, 
and tell him to remain there a day and a half: he sits down very demurely, as 
if he meant to fulfil his penance; but a moment after, behold! there is little 
Joe capering across the street to join two or three boys who are playing in a 
wagon. Take this boy as the germ of a tavern-haunter, a countryrou&eacute;, to 
spend a wild and brutal youth, ten years of his prime in the State Prison, and 
his old age in the poor-house.</p> 
<p>There are a great many dogs kept in the village, and many of the travellers 
also have dogs. Some are almost always playing about; and if a cow or a pig be 
passing, two or three of them scamper forth for an attack. Some of the younger 
sort chase pigeons, wheeling as they wheel. If a contest arises between two 
dogs, a number of others come with huge barking to join the fray, though I 
believe that they do not really take any active part in the contest, but swell 
the uproar by way of encouraging the combatants. When a traveller is starting 
from the door, his dog often gets in front of the horse, placing his forefeet 
down, looking the horse in the face, and barking loudly; then, as the horse 
comes on, running a little farther, and repeating the process; and this he does 
in spite of his master's remonstrances, till, the horse being fairly started, 
the dog follows on quietly. One dog, a diminutive little beast, has been taught 
to stand on his hind legs, and rub his face with his paw, which he does with an 
aspect of much endurance and deprecation. Another springs at people whom his 
master points out to him, barking and pretending to bite. These tricks make 
much mirth in the bar-room. All dogs, of whatever different sizes and dissimilar
&nbsp;varieties, acknowledge the common bond of species among themselves, and 
the largest one does not disdain to suffer his tail to be smelt of, nor to 
reciprocate that courtesy to the smallest. They appear to take much interest in 
one another; but there is always a degree of caution between two strange dogs 
when they meet.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><em>July</em> 3l<em>st.</em>--A visit to what is called &quot;Hudson's 
Cave,&quot; or &quot;Hudson's Falls,&quot; the tradition being that a man by 
the name of Henry Hudson, many years ago, chasing a deer, the deer fell over 
the place, which then first became known to white men. It is not properly a 
cave, but a fissure in a huge ledge of marble, through which a stream has been 
for ages forcing its way, and has left marks of its gradually wearing power on 
the tall crags, having made curious hollows from the summit down to the level 
which it has reached at the present day. The depth of the fissure in some 
places is at least fifty or sixty feet; perhaps more, and at several points it 
nearly closes over, and often the sight of the sky is hidden by the 
interposition of masses of the marble crags. The fissure is very irregular, so 
as not to be describable in words, and scarcely to be painted,--jutting 
buttresses, moss-grown, impending crags, with tall trees growing on their 
verge, nodding over the head of the observer at the bottom of the chasm, and 
rooted, as it were, in air. The part where the water works its way down is very 
narrow; but the chasm widens, after the descent, so as to form a spacious 
chamber between the crags, open to the sky, and its floor is strewn with fallen 
fragments of marble, and trees that have been precipitated long ago, and are 
heaped with drift-wood, left there by the freshets, when the scanty stream 
becomes a considerable&nbsp;waterfall. One crag, with a narrow ridge, which 
might be climbed without much difficulty, protrudes from the middle of the 
rock, and divides the fall. The passage through the cave made by the stream is 
very crooked, and interrupted, not only by fallen wrecks, but by deep pools of 
water, which probably have been forded by few. As the deepest pool occurs in 
the most uneven part of the chasm, where the hollows in the sides of the crag 
are deepest, so that each hollow is almost a cave by itself, I determined to 
wade through it. There was an accumulation of soft stuff on the bottom, so that 
the water did not look more than knee-deep; but, finding that my feet sunk in 
it, I took off my trousers, and waded through up to my middle. Thus I reached 
the most interesting part of the cave, where the whirlings of the stream had 
left the marks of its eddies in the solid marble, all up and down the two sides 
of the chasm. The water is now dammed for the construction of two marble 
saw-mills, else it would have been impossible to effect the passage; and I 
presume that, for years after the cave was discovered, the waters roared and 
tore their way in a torrent through this part of the chasm. While I was there, 
I heard voices, and a small stone tumbled down; and looking up towards the 
narrow strip of bright light, and the sunny verdure that peeped over the 
top,--looking up thither from the deep, gloomy depth,--I saw two or three men; 
and, not liking to be to them the most curious part of the spectacle, I waded 
back, and put on my clothes. The marble crags are overspread with a concretion, 
which makes them look as gray as granite, except where the continual flow of 
water keeps them of a snowy whiteness. If they were so white all over, it would 
be a splendid&nbsp;show. There is a marble-quarry close in the rear, above the 
cave, and in process of time the whole of the crags will be quarried into 
tombstones, doorsteps, fronts of edifices, fireplaces, etc. That will be a 
pity. On such portions of the walls as are within reach, visitors have 
sculptured their initials, or names at full length; and the white letters 
showing plainly on the gray surface, they have more obvious effect than such 
inscriptions generally have. There was formerly, I believe, a complete arch of 
marble, forming a natural bridge over the top of the cave; but this is no 
longer so. At the bottom of the broad chamber of the cave, standing in its 
shadow, the effect of the morning sunshine on the dark or bright foliage of the 
pines and other trees that cluster on the summits of the crags was particularly 
beautiful; and it was strange how such great trees had rooted themselves in 
solid marble, for so it seemed.</p> 
<p>After passing through this romantic and most picturesque spot, the stream 
goes onward to turn factories. Here its voice resounds within the hollow crags; 
there it goes onward, talking to itself, with babbling din, of its own wild 
thoughts and fantasies,--the voice of solitude and the wilderness,--loud and 
continual, but which yet does not seem to disturb the thoughtful wanderer, so 
that he forgets there is a noise. It talks along its storm-strewn path; it 
talks beneath tall precipices and high banks,--a voice that has been the same 
for innumerable ages; and yet, if you listen, you will perceive a continual 
change and variety in its babble, and sometimes it seems to swell louder upon 
the ear than at others,--in the same spot, I mean. By and by man makes a dam 
for it, and it pours over it, still making its voice heard, while it labors. At
&nbsp;one shop for manufacturing the marble, I saw the disk of a sundial as 
large as the top of a hogshead, intended for Williams College; also a small 
obelisk, and numerous gravestones. The marble is coarse-grained, but of a very 
brilliant whiteness. It is rather a pity that the cave is not formed of some 
worthless stone.</p> 
<p>In the deep valleys of the neighborhood, where the shadows at sunset are 
thrown from mountain to mountain, the clouds have a beautiful effect, flitting 
high over them, bright with heavenly gold. It seems as if the soul might rise 
up from the gloom, and alight upon them and soar away. Walking along one of the 
valleys the other evening, while a pretty fresh breeze blew across it, the 
clouds that were skimming over my head seemed to conform themselves to the 
valley's shape.</p> 
<p>At a distance, mountain summits look close together, almost as if forming 
one mountain, though in reality a village lies in the depths between them.</p> 
<p>A steam-engine in a factory to be supposed to possess a malignant spirit. 
It catches one man's arm, and pulls it off; seizes another by the coat-tails, 
and almost grapples him bodily; catches a girl by the hair, and scalps her; and 
finally draws in a man and crushes him to death.</p> 
<p>The one-armed soap-maker, Lawyer H----, wears an iron hook, which serves 
him instead of a hand for the purpose of holding on. They nickname him 
&quot;Black Hawk.&quot;</p> 
<p>North Adams still.--The village, viewed from the top of a hill to the 
westward at sunset, has a peculiarly happy and peaceful look. It lies on a 
level, surrounded by hills, and seems as if it lay in the hollow&nbsp;of a 
large hand. The Union Village may be seen, a manufacturing place, extending up 
a gorge of the hills. It is amusing to see all the distributed property of the 
aristocracy and commonalty, the various and conflicting interests of the town, 
the loves and hates, compressed into a space which the eye takes in as 
completely as the arrangement of a tea-table. The rush of the streams comes up 
the hill somewhat like the sound of a city.</p> 
<p>The hills about the village appear very high and steep sometimes, when the 
shadows of the clouds are thrown blackly upon them, while there is sunshine 
elsewhere; so that, seen in front, the effect of their gradual slope is lost. 
These hills, surrounding the town on all sides, give it a snug and insulated 
air; and, viewed from certain points, it would be difficult to tell how to get 
out, without climbing the mountain ridges; but the roads wind away and 
accomplish the passage without ascending very high. Sometimes the notes of a 
horn or bugle may be heard sounding afar among these passes of the mountains, 
announcing the coming of the stage-coach from Bennington or Troy or Greenfield 
or Pittsfield.</p> 
<p>There are multitudes of sheep among the hills, and they appear very tame 
and gentle; though sometimes, like the wicked, they &quot;flee when no man 
pursueth.&quot; But, climbing a rude, rough, rocky, stumpy, ferny height 
yesterday, one or two of them stood and stared at me with great earnestness. I 
passed on quietly, but soon heard an immense baa-ing up the hill, and all the 
sheep came galloping and scrambling after me, baa-ing with all their might in 
innumerable voices, running in a compact body, expressing the utmost eagerness, 
as if they sought the greatest imaginable&nbsp;favor from me; and so they 
accompanied me down the hill-side,--a most ridiculouscort&eacute;ge. Doubtless 
they had taken it into their heads that I brought them salt.</p> 
<p>The aspect of the village is peculiarly beautiful towards sunset, when 
there are masses of cloud about the sky,--the remnants of a thunder-storm. 
These clouds throw a shade upon large portions of the rampart of hills, and the 
hills towards the west are shaded of course; the clouds also make the shades 
deeper in the village, and thus the sunshine on the houses and trees, and along 
the street, is a bright, rich gold. The green is deeper in consequence of the 
recent rain.</p> 
<p>The doctors walk about the village with their saddle-bags on their arms, 
one always with a pipe in his mouth.</p> 
<p>A little dog, named Snapper, the same who stands on his hind legs, appears 
to be a roguish little dog, and the other day he stole one of the 
servant-girl's shoes, and ran into the street with it. Being pursued, he would 
lift the shoe in his mouth (while it almost dragged on the ground), and run a 
little way, then lie down with his paws on it and wait to be pursued again.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><em>August</em> 11<em>th.</em>--This morning, it being cloudy and boding of 
rain, the clouds had settled upon the mountains, both on the summits and 
ridges, all round the town, so that there seemed to be no way of gaining access 
to the rest of the world, unless by climbing above the clouds. By and by they 
partially dispersed, giving glimpses of the mountain ramparts through their 
obscurity, the separate clouds lying heavily upon the mountain's breast. In 
warm mornings, after rain, the mist breaks forth from the forests on the ascent 
of&nbsp;the mountains, like smoke,--the smoke of a volcano; then it soars up, 
and becomes a cloud in heaven. But these clouds to-day were real rain-clouds. 
Sometimes, it is said, while laboring up the mountain-side, they suddenly 
burst, and pour down their moisture in a cataract, sweeping all before it.</p> 
<p>Every new aspect of the mountains, or view from a different position, 
creates a surprise in the mind.</p> 
<p>Scenes and characters--A young country fellow, twenty or thereabouts, 
decently dressed, pained with the toothache. A doctor, passing on horseback, 
with his black leather saddle-bags behind him, a thin, frosty-haired man. Being 
asked to operate, he looks at the tooth, lances the gum, and the fellow being 
content to be dealt with on the spot, he seats himself in a chair on the stoop 
with great heroism. The doctor produces a rusty pair of iron forceps; a man 
holds the patient's head; the doctor perceives that, it being a difficult tooth 
to get at, wedged between the two largest in his jaws, he must pull very hard; 
and the instrument is introduced. A turn of the doctor's hand; the patient 
begins to utter a cry, but the tooth comes out first, with four prongs . The 
patient gets up, half amazed, pays the doctor ninepence, pockets the tooth, and 
the spectators are in glee and admiration.</p> 
<p>There was a fat woman, a stage-passenger to-day,--a wonder how she could 
possibly get through the door, which seemed not so wide as she. When she put 
her foot on the step, the stage gave a great lurch, she joking all the while. A 
great, coarse, red-faced dame. Other passengers,--three or four slender 
Williamstown students, a young girl, and a man with one leg and two crutches.
</p> 
<p>One of the most sensible men in this village is a plain, tall, elderly 
person, who is overseeing the mending of a road,--humorous, intelligent, with 
much thought about matters and things; and while at work he has a sort of 
dignity in handling the hoe or crowbar, which shows him to be the chief. In the 
evening he sits under the stoop, silent and observant from under the brim of 
his hat; but, occasion calling, he holds an argument about the benefit or 
otherwise of manufactories or other things. A simplicity characterizes him more 
than appertains to most Yankees.</p> 
<p>A man in a pea-green frock-coat, with velvet collar. Another in a flowered 
chintz frock-coat. There is a great diversity of hues in garments. A doctor, a 
stout, tall, round-paunched, red-faced, brutal-looking old fellow, who gets 
drunk daily. He sat down on the step of our stoop, looking surly, and speaking 
to nobody; then got up and walked homeward, with a morose swagger and a slight 
unevenness of gait, attended by a fine Newfoundland dog.</p> 
<p>A barouche with driver returned from beyond Greenfield or Troy empty, the 
passengers being left at the former place. The driver stops here for the night, 
and, while washing, enters into talk with an old man about the different roads 
over the mountain.</p> 
<p>People washing themselves at a common basin in the bar-room! and using the 
common hair-brushes! perhaps with a consciousness of praiseworthy neatness!</p> 
<p>A man with a cradle on his shoulder, having been cradling oats. I attended 
a child's funeral yesterday afternoon. There was an assemblage of people in a 
plain, homely apartment. Most of the men were dressed in their ordinary 
clothes, and one or two were in shirtsleeves. The coffin was placed in the midst
&nbsp;of us, covered with a velvet pall. A bepaid clergyman prayed (the 
audience remaining seated, while he stood up at the head of the coffin), read a 
passage of Scripture and commented upon it. While he read and prayed and 
expounded there was a heavy thunderstorm rumbling among the surrounding hills, 
and the lightning flashed fiercely through the gloomy room; and the preacher 
alluded to GOD'S voice of thunder.</p> 
<p>It is the custom in this part of the country--and perhaps extensively in 
the interior of New England--to bury the dead first in a charnel-house, or 
common tomb, where they remain till decay has so far progressed as to secure 
them from the resurrectionists. They are then reburied, with certain 
ceremonies, in their own peculiar graves.</p> 
<p>O. E. S----, a widower of forty or upwards, with a son of twelve and a pair 
of infant twins. He is a sharp, shrewd Yankee, with a Yankee's license of 
honesty. He drinks sometimes more than enough, and is guilty of peccadilloes 
with the fair sex; yet speaks most affectionately of his wife, and is a fond 
and careful father. He is a tall, thin, hard-featured man, with a sly 
expression of almost hidden grave humor, as if there were some deviltry pretty 
constantly in his mind,--which is probably the case. His brother tells me that 
he was driven almost crazy by the loss of his wife. It appears to me that men 
are more affected by the deaths of their wives than wives by the deaths of 
their husbands. Orrin S---- smokes a pipe, as do many of the guests.</p> 
<p>A walk this forenoon up the mountain ridge that walls in the town towards 
the east. The road is cut zigzag, the mountain being generally as steep as the 
roof of a house; yet the stage to Greenfield passes&nbsp;over this road two or 
three times a week. Graylock rose up behind me, appearing, with its two summits 
and a long ridge between, like a huge monster crouching down slumbering, with 
its head slightly elevated. Graylock is properly the name for the highest 
elevation. It appeared to better advantage the higher the point from which I 
viewed it. There were houses scattered here and there up the mountain-side, 
growing poorer as I ascended; the last that I passed was a mean log-hut, rough, 
rude, and dilapidated, with the smoke issuing from a chimney of small stones, 
plastered with clay; around it a garden of beans, with some attempt at flowers, 
and a green creeper running over the side of the cottage. Above this point 
there were various excellent views of mountain scenery, far off and near, and 
one village lying below in the hollow vale.</p> 
<p>Having climbed so far that the road seemed now to go downward, I retraced 
my steps. There was a wagon descending behind me; and as it followed the zigzag 
of the road I could hear the voices of the men high over my head, and sometimes 
I caught a glimpse of the wagon almost perpendicularly above me, while I was 
looking almost perpendicularly down to the log-hut aforementioned. Trees were 
thick on either hand,--oaks, pines, and others; and marble occasionally peeped 
up in the road; and there was a lime-kiln by the wayside, ready for burning.</p>
<p>Graylock had a cloud on his head this morning, the base of a heavy white 
cloud. The distribution of the sunshine amid mountain scenery is very striking; 
one does not see exactly why one spot should be in deep obscurity while others 
are all bright. The clouds throw their shadows upon the hill-sides as they move 
slowly along,--a transitory blackness.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>I passed a doctor high up the road in a sulky, with his black leather 
saddle-bags.</p> 
<p>Hudson's Cave is formed by Hudson's Brook. There is a natural arch of 
marble still in one part of it. The cliffs are partly made verdant with green 
moss, chiefly gray with oxidation; on some parts the white of the marble is 
seen; in interstices grow brake and other shrubs, so that there is naked 
sublimity seen through a good deal of clustering beauty. Above, the birch, 
poplars, and pines grow on the utmost verge of the cliffs, which jut far over, 
so that they are suspended in air; and whenever the sunshine finds its way into 
the depths of the chasm, the branches wave across it. There is a lightness, 
however, about their foliage, which greatly relieves what would otherwise be a 
gloomy scene. After the passage of the stream through the cliffs of marble, the 
cliffs separate on either side, and leave it to flow onward; intercepting its 
passage, however, by fragments of marble, some of them huge ones, which the 
cliffs have flung down, thundering into the bed of the stream through 
numberless ages. Doubtless some of these immense fragments had trees growing on 
them, which have now mouldered away. Decaying trunks are heaped in various 
parts of the gorge. The pieces of marble that are washed by the water are of a 
snow-white, and partially covered with a bright green water-moss, making a 
beautiful contrast.</p> 
<p>Among the cliffs, strips of earth-beach extend downward, and trees and 
large shrubs root themselves in that earth, thus further contrasting the 
nakedness of the stone with their green foliage. But the immediate part where 
the stream forces its winding passage through the rock is stern, dark, and 
mysterious.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Along the road, where it runs beneath a steep, there are high ridges, 
covered with trees,--the dew of midnight damping the earth, far towards 
midnoon. I observed the shadows of water-insects, as they swam in the pools of 
a stream. Looking down a streamlet, I saw a trunk of a tree, which has been 
overthrown by the wind, so as to form a bridge, yet sticking up all its 
branches, as if it were unwilling to assist anybody over.</p> 
<p>Green leaves, following the eddies of the rivulet, were now borne deep 
under water, and now emerged. Great uprooted trees, adhering midway down a 
precipice of earth, hung with their tops downward.</p> 
<p>There is an old man, selling the meats of butternuts under the stoop of the 
hotel. He makes that his station during a part of the season. He was dressed in 
a dark thin coat, ribbed velvet pantaloons, and a sort of moccasons, or shoes, 
appended to the legs of woollen stockings. He had on a straw hat, and his hair 
was gray, with a long, thin visage. His nuts were contained in a square tin 
box, having two compartments, one for the nuts, and another for maple sugar, 
which he sells in small cakes. He had three small tin measures for nuts,--one 
at one cent, others at two, four, and six cents; and as fast as they were 
emptied, he filled them again, and put them on the top of his box. He smoked a 
pipe, and talked with one man about whether it would be worth while to grow 
young again, and the duty of being contented with old age; about predestination 
and freewill and other metaphysics. I asked him what his sales amounted to in 
the course of a day. He said that butternuts did not sell so well as walnuts, 
which are not yet in season; that he might to-day have sold fifty cents' worth; 
of walnuts, never&nbsp;less than a dollar's worth, often more; and when he went 
round with a caravan, he had sold fifteen dollars' worth per day, and once as 
much as twenty dollars' worth. This promises to be an excellent year for 
walnuts. Chestnuts have been scarce for two or three years. He had one hundred 
chestnut-trees on his own land, and last year he offered a man twenty-five 
cents if he would find him a quart of good chestnuts on them. A bushel of 
walnuts would cost about ten dollars. He wears a pair of silver-rimmed 
spectacles.</p> 
<p>A drunken fellow sat down by him, and bought a cent's worth of his 
butternuts, and inquired what he would sell out to him for. The old man made an 
estimate, though evidently in jest, and then reckoned his box, measures, meats, 
and what little maple sugar he had, at four dollars. He had a very quiet 
manner, and expressed an intention of going to the Commencement at Williamstown 
to-morrow; His name, I believe, is Captain Gavett.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><em>Wednesday, August</em> 15<em>th.</em>--I went to Commencement at 
Williams College,--five miles distant. At the tavern were students with 
ribbons, pink or blue, fluttering from their buttonholes, these being the 
badges of rival societies. There was a considerable gathering of people, 
chiefly arriving in wagons or buggies, some in barouches, and very few in 
chaises. The most characteristic part of the scene was where the pedlars, 
gingerbread-sellers, etc., were collected, a few hundred yards from the 
meeting-house. There was a pedlar there from New York State, who sold his wares 
by auction, and I could have stood and listened to him all day long. Sometimes 
he would put up a heterogeny [note]</p> 
<p>[note: This is a word made by Mr. Hawthorne, but one that was needed.--S. 
H.]</p> 
<p>of&nbsp;articles in a lot,--as a paper of pins, a lead-pencil, and a 
shaving-box,--and knock them all down, perhaps for ninepence. Bunches of 
lead-pencils, steel-pens, pound-cakes of shaving-soap, gilt finger-rings, 
bracelets, clasps, and other jewelry, cards of pearl buttons, or steel 
(&quot;there is some steel about them, gentlemen, for my brother stole 'em, and 
I bore him out in it&quot;), bundles of wooden combs, boxes of matches, 
suspenders, and, in short, everything,--dipping his hand down into his wares, 
with the promise of a wonderful lot, and producing, perhaps, a bottle of 
opodeldoc, and joining it with a lead-pencil,--and when he had sold several 
things of the same kind, pretending huge surprise at finding &quot;just one 
more,&quot; if the lads lingered; saying, &quot;I could not afford to steal 
them for the price; for the remorse of conscience would be worth 
more,&quot;--all the time keeping an eye upon those who bought, calling for the 
pay, making change with silver or bills, and deciding on the goodness of banks; 
and saying to the boys, who climbed upon his cart, &quot;Fall down, roll down, 
tumble down, only get down&quot;; and uttering everything in the queer, 
humorous recitative in which he sold his articles. Sometimes he would pretend 
that a person had bid, either by word or wink and raised a laugh thus; never 
losing his self-possession, nor getting out of humor. When a man asked whether 
a bill were good: &quot;No! do you suppose I'd give you good money?&quot; When 
he delivered an article, he exclaimed, &quot;You're the lucky man,&quot; 
setting off his wares with the most extravagant eulogies. The people bought 
very freely, and seemed also to enjoy the fun. One little boy bought a 
shaving-box, perhaps meaning to speculate upon it. This character could not 
possibly be overdrawn; and he was really&nbsp;excellent, with his allusions to 
what was passing, intermingled, doubtless, with a good deal that was studied. 
He was a man between thirty and forty, with a face expressive of other ability, 
as well as of humor.</p> 
<p>A good many people were the better or the worse for liquor. There was one 
fellow,--named Randall, I think,--a round-shouldered, bulky, ill-hung devil, 
with a pale, sallow skin, black beard, and a sort of grin upon his face,--a 
species of laugh, yet not so much mirthful as indicating a strange mental and 
moral twist. He was very riotous in the crowd, elbowing, thrusting, seizing 
hold of people; and at last a ring was formed, and a regular wrestling-match 
commenced between him and a farmer-looking man. Randall brandished his legs 
about in the most ridiculous style, but proved himself a good wrestler, and 
finally threw his antagonist. He got up with the same grin upon his 
features,--not a grin of simplicity, but intimating knowingness. When more 
depth or force of expression was required, he could put on the most strangely 
ludicrous and ugly aspect (suiting his gesture and attitude to it) that can be 
imagined. I should like to see this fellow when he was perfectly sober.</p> 
<p>There were a good many blacks among the crowd. I suppose they used to 
emigrate across the border, while New York was a slave State. There were enough 
of them to form a party, though greatly in the minority; and, a squabble 
arising, some of the blacks were knocked down, and otherwise maltreated. I saw 
one old negro, a genuine specimen of the slave negro, without any of the 
foppery of the race in our part of the State,--an old fellow, with a bag, I 
suppose, of broken victuals, on his shoulder, and his pockets stuffed out at 
his hips with the like provender; full of grimaces and ridiculous antics, 
laughing laughably, yet without affectation; then talking with a strange kind 
of pathos about the whippings he used to get while he was a slave;--a singular 
creature, of mere feeling, with some glimmering of sense. Then there was 
another gray old negro, but of a different stamp, politic, sage, cautious, yet 
with boldness enough, talking about the rights of his race, yet so as not to 
provoke his audience; discoursing of the advantage of living under laws, and 
the wonders that might ensue, in that very assemblage, if there were no laws; 
in the midst of this deep wisdom, turning off the anger of a half-drunken 
fellow by a merry retort, a leap in the air, and a negro's laugh. I was 
interested--there being a drunken negro ascending the meeting-house steps, and 
near him three or four well-dressed and decent negro wenches--to see the look 
of scorn and shame and sorrow and painful sympathy which one of them assumed at 
this disgrace of her color.</p> 
<p>The people here show out their character much more strongly than they do 
with us; there was not the quiet, silent, dull decency of our public 
assemblages, but mirth, anger, eccentricity,--all manifesting themselves 
freely. There were many watermelons for sale, and people burying their muzzles 
deep in the juicy flesh of them. There were cider and beer. Many of the people 
had their mouths half opened in a grin, which, more than anything else, I 
think, indicates a low stage of refinement. A low-crowned hat--very low--is 
common. They are respectful to gentlemen.</p> 
<p>A bat being startled, probably, out of the meeting-house, by the commotion 
around, flew blindly about in&nbsp;the sunshine, and alighted on a man's 
sleeve. I looked at him,--a droll, winged, beast-insect, creeping up the man's 
arm, not over-clean, and scattering dust on the man's coat from his vampire 
wings. The man stared at him, and let the spectators stare for a minute, and 
then shook him gently off; and the poor devil took a flight across the green to 
the meeting-house, and then, I believe, alighted on somebody else. Probably he 
was put to death. Bats are very numerous in these parts.</p> 
<p>There was a drunken man, annoying people with his senseless talk and 
impertinences, impelled to perform eccentricities by an evil spirit in him; and 
a pale little boy, with a bandaged leg, whom his father brought out of the 
tavern and put into a barouche. Then the boy heedfully placed shawls and 
cushions about his leg to support it, his face expressive of pain and 
care,--not transitory, but settled pain, of long and forcedly patient 
endurance; and this painful look, perhaps, gave his face more intelligence than 
it might otherwise have had, though it was naturally a sensitive face. 
Well-dressed ladies were in the meeting-house in silks and cambrics,--the 
sunburnt necks in contiguity with the delicate fabrics of the dresses showing 
the yeoman's daughters.</p> 
<p>Country graduates,--rough, brown-featured, school-master-looking, 
half-bumpkin, half-scholarly figures, in black ill-cut broadcloth,--their 
manners quite spoilt by what little of the gentleman there was in them.</p> 
<p>The landlord of the tavern keeping his eye on a man whom he suspected of an 
intention to bolt. [note]</p> 
<p>[note: A word meaning in Worcester, I find, &quot;to spring out with speed 
and suddenness.&quot;--S. H.]</p> 
<p>The next day after Commencement was bleak and&nbsp;rainy from midnight till 
midnight, and a good many guests were added to our table in consequence. Among 
them were some of the Williamstown students, gentlemanly young fellows, with a 
brotherly feeling for each other, a freedom about money concerns, a 
half-boyish, half-manly character; and my heart warmed to them. They took their 
departure--two for South Adams and two across the Green Mountains--in the midst 
of the rain. There was one of the graduates with his betrothed, and his 
brother-in-law and wife, who stayed during the day,--the graduate the very 
model of a country schoolmaster in his Sunday clothes, being his Commencement 
suit of black broadcloth and pumps. He is engaged as assistant teacher of the 
academy at Shelburne Falls. There was also the high sheriff of Berkshire, Mr. 
Twining, with a bundle of writs under his arm, and some of them peeping out of 
his pockets. Also several Trojan men and women, who had been to Commencement. 
Likewise a young clergyman, graduate of Brown College, and student of the 
Divinity School at Cambridge. He had come across the Hoosic, or Green 
Mountains, about eighteen miles, on foot, from Charlemont, where he is 
preaching, and had been to Commencement. Knowing little of men and matters, and 
desiring to know more, he was very free in making acquaintance with people, but 
could not do it handsomely. A singular smile broke out upon his face on slight 
provocation. He was awkward in his manners, yet it was not an ungentlemanly 
awkwardness,--intelligent as respects book-learning, but much deficient in 
worldly tact. It was pleasant to observe his consciousness of this deficiency, 
and how he strove to remedy it by mixing as much as possible with people, and 
sitting almost all day in the&nbsp;bar-room to study character. Sometimes he 
would endeavor to contribute his share to the general amusement,--as by 
growling comically, to provoke and mystify a dog; and by some bashful and 
half-apropos observations.</p> 
<p>In the afternoon there came a fresh bevy of students onward from 
Williamstown; but they made only a transient visit, though it was still 
raining. These were a rough-hewn, heavy set of fellows, from the hills and 
woods in this neighborhood,--great unpolished bumpkins, who had grown up 
farmer-boys, and had little of the literary man, save green spectacles and 
black broadcloth (which all of them had not), talking with a broad accent, and 
laughing clown-like, while sheepishness overspread all, together with a vanity 
at being students. One of the party was six feet seven inches high, and all his 
herculean dimensions were in proportion; his features, too, were cast in a 
mould suitable to his stature. This giant was not ill-looking, but of a rather 
intelligent aspect. His motions were devoid of grace, but yet had a rough 
freedom, appropriate enough to such a figure. These fellows stayed awhile, 
talked uncouthly about college matters, and started in the great open wagon 
which had brought them and their luggage hither. We had a fire in the bar-room 
almost all day,--a great, blazing fire,--and it was pleasant to have this day 
of bleak November weather, and cheerful fireside talk, and wet garments smoking 
in the fireside heat, still in the summer-time. Thus the day wore on with a 
sort of heavy, lazy pleasantness; and night set in, still stormy.</p> 
<p>In the morning it was cloudy, but did not rain, and I went with the little 
clergyman to Hudson's Cave. The stream which they call North Branch, and into
&nbsp;which Hudson's Brook empties, was much swollen, and tumbled and dashed 
and whitened over the rocks, and formed real cascades over the dams, and rushed 
fast along the side of the cliffs, which had their feet in it. Its color was 
deep brown, owing to the washing of the banks which the rain had poured into 
it. Looking back, we could see a cloud on Graylock; but on other parts of 
Saddle Mountain there were spots of sunshine, some of most glorious brightness, 
contrasting with the general gloom of the sky, and the deep shadow which lay on 
the earth.</p> 
<p>We looked at the spot where the stream makes its entrance into the marble 
cliff, and it was (this morning, at least) the most striking view of the cave. 
The water dashed down in a misty cascade, through what looked like the portal 
of some infernal subterranean structure; and far within the portal we could see 
the mist and the falling water; and it looked as if, but for these obstructions 
of view, we might have had a deeper insight into a gloomy region.</p> 
<p>After our return, the little minister set off for his eighteen miles' 
journey across the mountains; and I was occupied the rest of the forenoon with 
an affair of stealing,--a woman of forty or upwards being accused of stealing a 
needle-case and other trifles from a factory-girl at a boarding-house. She came 
here to take passage in a stage; but Putnam, a justice of the peace, examined 
her and afterwards ordered her to be searched by Laura and Eliza, the 
chambermaid and table-waiter. Hereupon was much fun and some sympathy. They 
searched, and found nothing that they sought, though she gave up a pair of 
pantalets, which she pretended to have taken by mistake. Afterwards, she being 
in the parlor, I went in; and she&nbsp;immediately began to talk to me, giving 
me an account of the affair, speaking with the bitterness of a wronged person, 
with a sparkling eye, yet with great fluency and self-possession. She is a 
yellow, thin, and battered old thing, yet rather country-lady-like in aspect 
and manners. I heard Eliza telling another girl about it, under my window; and 
she seemed to think that the poor woman's reluctance to be searched arose from 
the poorness of her wardrobe and of the contents of her bandbox.</p> 
<p>At parting, Eliza said to the girl, &quot;What do you think I heard 
somebody say about you? That it was enough to make anybody's eyes start square 
out of their head to look at such red cheeks as yours.&quot; Whereupon the girl 
turned off the compliment with a laugh, and took her leave.</p> 
<p>There is an old blind dog, recognizing his friends by the sense of smell. I 
observed the eager awkwardness with which he accomplishes the recognition, his 
carefulness in descending steps, and generally in his locomotion. He evidently 
has not forgotten that he once had the faculty of sight; for he turns his eyes 
with earnestness towards those who attract his attention, though the orbs are 
plainly sightless.</p> 
<p>Here is an Englishman,--a thorough-going Tory and Monarchist,--upholding 
everything English, government, people, habits, education, manufactures, modes 
of living, and expressing his dislike of all Americanisms,--and this in a 
quiet, calm, reasonable way, as if it were quite proper to live in a country 
and draw his subsistence from it, and openly abuse it. He imports his clothes 
from England, and expatiates on the superiority of English boots, hats, 
cravats, etc. He is a man of unmalleable habits, and wears his dress of the 
same fashion as that of twenty years ago.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><em>August</em> 18<em>th.</em>--There has come one of the proprietors, or 
superintendents of a caravan of animals,--a large, portly-paunched, 
dark-complexioned, brandy-burnt, heavy-faced man of about fifty; with a 
diminutive nose in proportion to the size of his face,--thick lips; 
nevertheless he has the air of a man who has seen much, and derived such 
experience as was for his purpose. Also it is the air of a man not in a 
subordinate station, though vulgar and coarse. He arrived in a wagon, with a 
span of handsome gray horses, and ordered dinner. He had left his caravan at 
Worcester, and came from thence and over the mountain hither, to settle 
stopping-places for the caravan. The nearest place to this, I believe, was 
Charlemont; the penultimate at Greenfield. In stopping at such a village as 
this, they do not expect much profit, if any; but would be content with enough 
to pay their travelling expenses, while they look to gather gain at larger 
places. In this village, it seems, the selectmen had resolved not to license 
any public exhibition of the kind; and it was interesting to attend to the 
consultations whether it were feasible to overcome the objections, and what 
might be the best means. Orrin S---- and the chance passers-by took part in the 
discussion. The scruple is that the factory-girls, having ready money by them, 
spend it for these nonsenses, quitting their work; whereas, were it a mere 
farming-town, the caravan would take little in proportion to their spendings. 
The opinion generally was that the license could not be obtained; and the 
portly man's face grew darker and downcast at the prospect; and he took out a 
travelling-map and looked it carefully over, to discover some other station. 
This is something like the planning of the march of an army. It was&nbsp;
finally resolved to enlist the influence of a brother-in-law of the head 
selectman, and try to gain his consent. Whereupon the caravan-man and the 
brother-in-law (who, being a tavern-keeper, was to divide the custom of the 
caravan people with this house) went to make the attempt,--the caravan-man 
stalking along with stiff, awkward bulk and stature, yet preserving a 
respectability withal though with somewhat of the blackguard. Before he went, 
he offered a wager of &quot;a drink of rum or a chaw of tobacco&quot; that he 
did not succeed. When he came back there was a flush in his face and a sparkle 
in his eye that did not look like failure; but I know not what was the result. 
He took a glass of wine with the brother-in-law,--a grave, thin, frosty-haired, 
shrewd-looking yeoman, in his shirt-sleeves,--then ordered his horses, paid his 
bill, and drove off, accompanied still by the same yeoman, perhaps to get the 
permission of the other two selectmen. If he does not get a license here, he 
will try at Cheshire.</p> 
<p>A fellow appears with a pink guard-chain and two breast-pins in his 
shirt,--one a masonic one of gold, with compass and square, and the other of 
colored glass, set in filigree brass,--and the shirt a soiled one.</p> 
<p>A tendency to obesity is more common in this part of the country than I 
have noticed it elsewhere.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><em>August</em> 19<em>th.</em>--I drove with Orrin S---- last evening to an 
old farmer's house to get some chickens. Entering the kitchen, I observed a 
fireplace with rough stone jambs and back, and a marble hearth, cracked, and 
otherwise contrasting a roughness of workmanship with the value of the 
material. There&nbsp;was a clock without a case, the weights being visible, and 
the pendulum swinging in air,--and a coffee-mill fixed against the wall. A 
religious newspaper lay on the mantel-piece. The old farmer was reluctant to go 
after the fowls, declaring that it would be impossible to find them in the 
dark; but Orrin insisting, he lighted a lamp, and we all went together, and 
quickly found them, roosted about the wood-pile; whereupon Orrin speedily laid 
hands on five, and wrung their necks in a twinkling, they fluttering long after 
they should have been dead. When we had taken our departure, Orrin remarked, 
&quot;How faint-hearted these old fellows are!&quot; and it was a good 
observation; for it was the farmer's timorous age that made him doubt the 
practicability of catching the chickens, and it contrasted well with the 
persevering energy of the middle-aged Orrin. But Orrin inquired, somewhat 
dolefully, whether I should suppose that he himself bewailed the advances of 
age. It is a grievous point with him.</p> 
<p>In the evening there was a strange fellow in the bar-room,--a sort of mock 
Methodist,--a cattle-drover, who had stopped here for the night with two cows 
and a Durham bull. All his talk turned upon religion, and he would ever and 
anon burst out in some strain of scriptural-styled eloquence, chanted through 
his nose, like an exhortation at a camp-meeting. A group of Universalists and 
no-religionists sat around him, making him their butt, and holding wild 
argument with him; and he strangely mingled humor, with his enthusiasm, and 
enthusiasm with his humor so that it was almost impossible to tell whether he 
were in jest or earnest. Probably it was neither, but an eccentricity, an 
almost monomania, that has grown&nbsp;upon him,--perhaps the result of strong 
religious excitement. And, having been a backslider, he is cursed with a 
half-frenzied humor. In the morning he talked in the same strain at breakfast, 
while quaffing fourteen cups of tea,--Eliza, all the while, as she supplied 
him, entreating him not to drink any more. After breakfast (it being the 
Sabbath) he drove his two cows and bull past the stoop, raising his staff, and 
running after them with strange, uncouth gestures; and the last word I heard 
from him was an exhortation: &quot;Gentlemen, now all of you take your Bibles, 
and meditate on divine things,&quot;--this being uttered with raised hands, and 
a Methodistical tone, intermingled, as was his expression, with something 
humorous; so that, to the last, the puzzle was still kept up, whether he was an 
enthusiast or a jester. He wore a suit of coarse brown cloth, cut in rather a 
Quaker fashion; and he had a large nose, and his face expressed enthusiasm and 
humor,--a sort of smile and twinkle of the eye, with wildness. He is excellent 
at a bargain; and if, in the midst of his ghostly exhortation, the talk were 
turned on cattle, he eagerly seized the topic and expatiated on it.</p> 
<p>While this fellow was enumerating the Universalists in neighboring towns 
who had turned from their errors on their death-beds, some one exclaimed, 
&quot;John Hodges! why, he isn't dead,--he's alive and well.&quot; Whereat 
there was a roar of laughter. While holding an argument at table, I heard him 
mutter to himself at something that his adversary said; and though I could not 
distinguish what it was, the tone did more to convince me of some degree of 
earnestness than aught beside. This character might be wrought into a strange 
portrait of something sad, terrific, and laughable.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The Sabbath wore away lazily, and therefore wickedly. The heavy caravan-man 
inquired for some book of<em>light</em> reading, and, having obtained an old 
volume of a literary paper, betook himself to the seat of his wagon, to read. 
At other times he smoked, and talked sensibly enough with anybody that offered. 
He is a man of sense, though not quick, and seems to be a fair man.</p> 
<p>When he walks, he puts the thumb of each hand into the armhole of his 
waistcoat, and moves along stiffly, with a knock-kneed gait. His talk was 
chiefly of hotels, and such matters as a man, always travelling, without any 
purpose of observation for mental improvement, would be interested in. He spoke 
of his life as a hard one.</p> 
<p>There was a Methodist quarterly meeting here, and a love-feast.</p> 
<p>There is a fellow hereabout who refuses to pay six dollars for the coffin 
in which his wife was buried. She died about six months since, and I believe he 
is already engaged to another. He is young and rather comely, but has not a 
straightforward look.</p> 
<p>One man plods along, looking always on the ground, without ever lifting his 
eyes to the mountain scenery, and forest, and clouds, above and around him. 
Another walks the street with a quick, prying eye, and sharp face,--the most 
expressive possible of one on the look-out for gain,--of the most disagreeable 
class of Yankees. There is also a sour-looking, unwholesome boy, the son of 
this man, whose voice is querulous and ill-natured, precisely suited to his 
aspect. So is his character.</p> 
<p>We have another with Indian blood in him, and the straight, black 
hair,--something of the tawny skin&nbsp;and the quick, shining eye of the 
Indian. He seems reserved, but is not ill-natured when spoken to. There is so 
much of the white in him, that he gives the impression of belonging to a 
civilized race, which causes the more strange sensation on discovering that he 
has a wild lineage.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><em>August</em> 22<em>d.</em>--I walked out into what is called the Notch 
this forenoon, between Saddle Mountain and another. There are good farms in 
this Notch, although the ground is considerably elevated,--this morning, 
indeed, above the clouds; for I penetrated through one in reaching the higher 
region, although I found sunshine there. Graylock was hidden in clouds, and the 
rest of Saddle Mountain had one partially wreathed about it; but it was 
withdrawn before long. It was very beautiful cloud-scenery. The clouds lay on 
the breast of the mountain, dense, white, well-defined, and some of them were 
in such close vicinity that it seemed as if I could infold myself in them; 
while others, belonging to the same fleet, were floating through the blue sky 
above. I had a view of Williamstown at the distance of a few miles,--two or 
three, perhaps,--a white village and steeple in a gradual hollow, with high 
mountainous swells heaving themselves up, like immense, subsiding waves, far 
and wide around it. On these high mountain-waves rested the white summer 
clouds, or they rested as still in the air above; and they were formed into 
such fantastic shapes that they gave the strongest possible impression of being 
confounded or intermixed with the sky. It was like a day-dream to look at it; 
and the students ought to be day-dreamers, all of them,--when cloud-land is one 
and the same thing with the substantial earth. By&nbsp;degrees all these clouds 
flitted away, and the sultry summer sun burned on hill and valley. As I was 
walking home, an old man came down the mountain-path behind me in a wagon, and 
gave me a drive to the village. Visitors being few in the Notch, the women and 
girls looked from the windows after me; the men nodded and greeted me with a 
look of curiosity; and two little girls whom I met, bearing tin pails, 
whispered one another and smiled.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>North Adams, <em>August</em> 23<em>d.</em>--The county commissioners held a 
court in the bar-room yesterday afternoon, for the purpose of letting out the 
making of the new road over the mountain. The commissioners sat together in 
attitudes of some dignity, with one leg laid across another; and the people, to 
the number of twenty or thirty, sat round about with their hats on, in their 
shirtsleeves, with but little, yet with some, formality. Several had come from 
a distance to bid for the job. They sat with whips in their hands. The first 
bid was three dollars,--then there was a long silence,--then a bid of two 
dollars eighty-five cents, and finally it was knocked down at two eighteen, per 
rod. A disposition to bid was evidenced in one man by his joking on the bid of 
another.</p> 
<p>After supper, as the sun was setting, a man passed by the door with a 
hand-organ, connected with which was a row of figures, such as dancers, 
pirouetting and turning, a lady playing on a piano, soldiers, a negro wench 
dancing, and opening and shutting a huge red mouth,--all these keeping time to 
the lively or slow tunes of the organ. The man had a pleasant, but sly, dark 
face; he carried his whole establishment on his shoulder, it being fastened to 
a staff which he rested&nbsp;on the ground when he performed. A little crowd of 
people gathered about him on the stoop, peeping over each other's heads with 
huge admiration,--fat Otis Hodge, and the tall stage-driver, and the little 
boys all declaring that it was the masterpiece of sights. Some few coppers did 
the man obtain, as well as much praise. He had come over the high, solitary 
mountain, where for miles there could hardly be a soul to hear his music.</p> 
<p>In the evening, a portly old commissioner, a cheerful man enough, was 
sitting reading the newspaper in the parlor, holding the candle between the 
newspaper and his eyes,--its rays glittering on his silver-bowed spectacles and 
silvery hair. A pensive mood of age had come upon him, and sometimes he heaved 
a long sigh, while he turned and returned the paper, and folded it for 
convenient reading. By and by a gentleman came to see him, and he talked with 
him cheerfully.</p> 
<p>The fat old squire, whom I have mentioned more than once, is an odd figure, 
with his bluff, red face,--coarsely red,--set in silver hair,--his clumsy legs, 
which he moves in a strange straddle, using, I believe, a broomstick for a 
staff. The breadth of back of these fat men is truly a wonder.</p> 
<p>A decent man, at table the other day, took the only remaining potato out of 
the dish, on the end of his knife, and offered his friend half of it!</p> 
<p>The mountains look much larger and more majestic sometimes than at 
others,--partly because the mind may be variously disposed, so as to comprehend 
them more or less, and partly that an imperceptible (or almost so) haze adds a 
great deal to the effect. Saddleback often looks a huge, black 
mass,--black-green, or black-blue.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The cave makes a fresh impression upon me every time I visit it,--so deep, 
so irregular, so gloomy, so stern,--part of its walls the pure white of the 
marble,--others covered with a gray decomposition and with spots of moss, and 
with brake growing where there is a handful of earth. I stand and look into its 
depths at various points, and hear the roar of the stream re&euml;choing up. It 
is like a heart that has been rent asunder by a torrent of passion, which has 
raged and foamed, and left its ineffaceable traces; though now there is but a 
little rill of feeling at the bottom.</p> 
<p>In parts, trees have fallen across the fissure,--trees with large trunks.
</p> 
<p>I bathed in the stream in this old, secluded spot, which I frequent for 
that purpose. To reach it, I cross one branch of the stream on stones, and then 
pass to the other side of a little island, overgrown with trees and underbrush. 
Where I bathe, the stream has partially dammed itself up by sweeping together 
tree-trunks and slabs and branches, and a thousand things that have come down 
its current for years perhaps; so that there is a deep pool, full of eddies and 
little whirlpools, which would carry me away, did I not take hold of the stem 
of a small tree that lies opportunely transversely across the water. The bottom 
is uneven, with rocks of various size, against which it is difficult to keep 
from stumbling, so rapid is the stream. Sometimes it bears along branches and 
strips of bark,--sometimes a green leaf, or perchance a dry one,--occasionally 
overwhelmed by the eddies and borne deep under water, then rushing atop the 
waves.</p> 
<p>The forest, bordering the stream, produces its effect by a complexity of 
causes,--the old and stern trees, with stately trunks and dark foliage,--as the 
almost&nbsp;black pines,--the young trees, with lightsome green foliage,--as 
sapling oaks, maples, and poplars,--then the old, decayed trunks, that are seen 
lying here and there, all mouldered, so that the foot would sink into them. The 
sunshine, falling capriciously on a casual branch considerably within the 
forest verge, while it leaves nearer trees in shadow, leads the imagination 
into the depths. But it soon becomes bewildered there. Rocks strewn about, half 
hidden in the fallen leaves, must not be overlooked.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><em>August</em> 26<em>th.</em>--A funeral last evening, nearly at 
sunset,--a coffin of a boy about ten years old laid on a one-horse wagon among 
some straw,--two or three barouches and wagons following. As the funeral passed 
though the village street, a few men formed a short procession in front of the 
coffin, among whom were Orrin S---- and I. The burial-ground (there are two in 
the town) is on the sides and summit of a round hill, which is planted with 
cypress and other trees, among which the white marble gravestones show 
pleasantly. The grave was dug on the steep slope of a hill; and the 
grave-digger was waiting there, and two or three other shirt-sleeved yeomen, 
leaning against the trees.</p> 
<p>Orrin S----, a wanton and mirth-making middle-aged man, who would not seem 
to have much domestic feeling, took a chief part on the occasion, assisting in 
taking the coffin from the wagon and in lowering it into the grave. There being 
some superfluous earth at the bottom of the grave, the coffin was drawn up 
again after being once lowered, and the obstacle removed with a hoe; then it 
was lowered again for the last time. While this was going on, the father and
&nbsp;mother stood weeping at the upper end of the grave, at the head of the 
little procession,--the mother sobbing with stifled violence, and peeping forth 
to discover why the coffin was drawn up again. It being fitted in its place, 
Orrin S---- strewed some straw upon it,--this being the custom here, because 
&quot;the clods on the coffin-lid have an ugly sound.&quot; Then the Baptist 
minister, having first whispered to the father, removed his hat, the spectators 
all doing the same, and thanked them &quot;in the name of these mourners, for 
this last act of kindness to them.&quot;</p> 
<p>In all these rites Orrin S---- bore the chief part with real feeling and 
sadly decorous demeanor. After the funeral, I took a walk on the Williamstown 
road, towards the west. There had been a heavy shower in the afternoon, and 
clouds were brilliant all over the sky, around Graylock and everywhere else. 
Those over the hills of the west were the most splendid in purple and gold, 
and, there being a haze, it added immensely to their majesty and dusky 
magnificence.</p> 
<p>This morning I walked a little way along the mountain road, and stood 
awhile in the shadow of some oak and chestnut-trees,--it being a warm, bright, 
sunshiny morning. The shades lay long from trees and other objects, as at 
sunset, but how different this cheerful and light radiance from the mild repose 
of sunset! Locusts, crickets, and other insects were making music. Cattle were 
feeding briskly, with morning appetites. The wakeful voices of children were 
heard in a neighboring hollow. The dew damped the road, and formed many-colored 
drops in the grass. In short, the world was not weary with a long, sultry day, 
but in a fresh, recruited state, fit to carry it through such a day.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>A rough-looking, sunburnt, soiled-shirted, odd, middle-aged little man came 
to the house a day or two ago, seeking work. He had come from Ohio, and was 
returning to his native place, somewhere in New England, stopping occasionally 
to earn money to pay his way. There was something rather ludicrous in his 
physiognomy and aspect. He was very free to talk with all and sundry. He made a 
long eulogy on his dog Tiger, yesterday, insisting on his good moral character, 
his not being quarrelsome, his docility, and all other excellent qualities that 
a huge, strong, fierce mastiff could have. Tiger is the bully of the village, 
and keeps all the other dogs in awe. His aspect is very spirited, trotting 
massively along, with his tail elevated and his head likewise. &quot;When he 
sees a dog that's anything near his size, he's apt to growl a 
little,&quot;--Tiger had the marks of a battle on him,--&quot;yet he's a good 
dog.&quot;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><em>Friday, August</em> 31<em>st.</em>--A drive on Tuesday to Shelburne 
Falls, twenty-two miles or thereabouts distant. Started at about eight o'clock 
in a wagon with Mr. Leach and Mr. Birch. Our road lay over the Green Mountains, 
the long ridge of which made awful by a dark, heavy, threatening cloud, 
apparently rolled and condensed along the whole summit. As we ascended the 
zigzag road, we looked behind, at every opening in the forest, and beheld a 
wide landscape of mountain-swells and valleys intermixed, and old Graylock and 
the whole of Saddleback. Over the wide scene there was a general gloom; but 
there was a continual vicissitude of bright sunshine flitting over it, now 
resting for a brief space on portions of the heights, now flooding the valleys 
with green&nbsp;brightness, now making out distinctly each dwelling, and the 
hotels, and then two small brick churches of the distant village, denoting its 
prosperity, while all around seemed under adverse fortunes. But we, who stood 
so elevated above mortal things, and saw so wide and far, could see the 
sunshine of prosperity departing from one spot and rolling towards another, so 
that we could not think it much matter which spot were sunny or gloomy at any 
one moment.</p> 
<p>The top of this Hoosic Mountain is a long ridge, marked on the county map 
as two thousand one hundred and sixty feet above the sea; on this summit is a 
valley, not very deep, but one or two miles wide, in which is the town of 
L----. Here there are respectable farmers, though it is a rough, and must be a 
bleak place. The first house, after reaching the summit, is a small, homely 
tavern. We left our horse in the shed, and, entering the little unpainted 
bar-room, we heard a voice, in a strange, outlandish accent, exclaiming 
&quot;Diorama.&quot; It was an old man, with a full, gray-bearded countenance, 
and Mr. Leach exclaimed, &quot;Ah, here's the old Dutchman again!&quot; And he 
answered, &quot;Yes, Captain, here's the old Dutchman,&quot; though, by the 
way, he is a German, and travels the country with this diorama in a wagon, and 
had recently been at South Adams, and was now returning from Saratoga Springs. 
We looked though the glass orifice of his machine, while he exhibited a 
succession of the very worst scratches and daubings that can be imagined,--worn 
out, too, and full of cracks and wrinkles, dimmed with tobacco-smoke, and every 
other wise dilapidated. There were none in a later fashion than thirty years 
since, except some figures that had been cut from tailors' show-bills. There 
were views&nbsp;of cities and edifices in Europe, of Napoleon's battles and 
Nelson's sea-fights, in the midst of which would be seen a gigantic, brown, 
hairy hand (the Hand of Destiny) pointing at the principal points of the 
conflict, while the old Dutchman explained. He gave a good deal of dramatic 
effect to his descriptions, but his accent and intonation cannot be written. He 
seemed to take interest and pride in his exhibition; yet when the utter and 
ludicrous miserabiity thereof made us laugh, he joined in the joke very 
readily. When the last picture had been shown, he caused a country boor, who 
stood gaping beside the machine, to put his head within it, and thrust out his 
tongue. The head becoming gigantic, a singular effect was produced.</p> 
<p>The old Dutchman's exhibition being over, a great dog, apparently an 
elderly dog, suddenly made himself the object of notice, evidently in rivalship 
of the Dutchman. He had seemed to be a good-natured, quiet kind of dog, 
offering his head to be patted by those who were kindly disposed towards him. 
This great, old dog, unexpectedly, and of his own motion, began to run round 
after his not very long tail with the utmost eagerness; and, catching hold of 
it, he growled furiously at it, and still continued to circle round, growling 
and snarling with increasing rage, as if one half of his body were at deadly 
enmity with the other. Faster and faster went he, round and roundabout, growing 
still fiercer, till at last he ceased in a state of utter exhaustion; but no 
sooner had his exhibition finished than he became the same mild, quiet, 
sensible old dog as before; and no one could have suspected him of such 
nonsense as getting enraged with his own tail. He was first taught this trick by
&nbsp;attaching a bell to the end of his tail; but he now commences entirely of 
his own accord, and I really believe he feels vain at the attention he excites.
</p> 
<p>It was chill and bleak on the mountain-top, and a fire was burning in the 
bar-room. The old Dutchman bestowed on everybody the title of 
&quot;Captain,&quot; perhaps because such a title has a great chance of suiting 
an American.</p> 
<p>Leaving the tavern, we drove a mile or two farther to the eastern brow of 
the mountain, whence we had a view, over the tops of a multitude of heights, 
into the intersecting valleys down which we were to plunge,--and beyond them 
the blue and indistinctive scene extended to the east and north for at least 
sixty miles. Beyond the hills it looked almost as if the blue ocean might be 
seen. Monadnock was visible, like a sapphire cloud against the sky. Descending, 
we by and by got a view of the Deerfield River, which makes a bend in its 
course from about north and south to about east and west, coming out from one 
defile among the mountains, and flowing through another. The scenery on the 
eastern side of the Green Mountains is incomparably more striking than on the 
western, where the long swells and ridges have a flatness of effect; and even 
Graylock heaves itself so gradually that it does not much strike the beholder. 
But on the eastern part, peaks one or two thousand feet high rash up on either 
bank of the river in ranges, thrusting out their shoulders side by side. They 
are almost precipitous, clothed in woods, through which the naked rock pushes 
itself forth to view. Sometimes the peak is bald, while the forest wraps the 
body of the hill, and the baldness gives it an indescribably stern effect. 
Sometimes the precipice rises with abruptness from&nbsp;the immediate side of 
the river; sometimes there is a cultivated valley on either side,--cultivated 
long, and with all the smoothness and antique rurality of a farm near 
cities,--this gentle picture strongly set off by the wild mountain-frame around 
it. Often it would seem a wonder how our road was to continue, the mountains 
rose so abruptly on either side, and stood, so direct a wall, across our onward 
course; while, looking behind, it would be an equal mystery how we had gotten 
thither, through the huge base of the mountain, that seemed to have reared 
itself erect after our passage. But, passing onward, a narrow defile would give 
us egress into a scene where new mountains would still appear to bar us. Our 
road was much of it level; but scooped out among mountains. The river was a 
brawling stream, shallow and roughened by rocks; now we drove on a plane with 
it; now there was a sheer descent down from the roadside upon it, often 
unguarded by any kind of fence, except by the trees that contrived to grow on 
the headlong interval. Between the mountains there were gorges, that led the 
imagination away into new scenes of wildness. I have never driven through such 
romantic scenery, where there was such a variety and boldness of mountain 
shapes as this; and though it was a broad sunny day, the mountains diversified 
the view with sunshine and shadow, and glory and gloom.</p> 
<p>In Charlemont (I think), after passing a bridge, we saw a very curious rock 
on the shore of the river, about twenty feet from the roadside. Clambering down 
the bank, we found it a complete arch, hollowed out of the solid rock, and as 
high as the arched entrance of an ancient church, which it might be taken to 
be, though considerably dilapidated and&nbsp;weather-worn. The water flows 
through it, though the rock afforded standing room, beside the pillars. It was 
really like the archway of an enchanted palace, all of which has vanished 
except the entrance,--now only into nothingness and empty space. We climbed to 
the top of the arch, in which the traces of water having eddied are very 
perceptible. This curiosity occurs in a wild part of the river's course, and in 
a solitude of mountains.</p> 
<p>Farther down, the river becoming deeper, broader, and more placid, little 
boats were seen moored along it, for the convenience of crossing. Sometimes, 
too, the well-beaten track of wheels and hoofs passed down to its verge, then 
vanished, and appeared on the other side, indicating a ford. We saw one house, 
pretty, small, with green blinds, and much quietness in its environments on the 
other side of the river, with a flat-bottomed boat for communication. It was a 
pleasant idea that the world was kept off by the river.</p> 
<p>Proceeding onward, we reached Shelburne Falls. Here the river, in the 
distance of a few hundred yards, makes a descent of about a hundred and fifty 
feet over a prodigious bed of rock. Formerly it doubtless flowed unbroken over 
the rock, merely creating a rapid; and traces of water having raged over it are 
visible in portions of the rock that now lie high and dry. At present the river 
roars through a channel which it has worn in the stone, leaping in two or three 
distinct falls, and rushing downward, as from flight to flight of a broken and 
irregular staircase. The mist rises from the highest of these cataracts, and 
forms a pleasant object in the sunshine. The best view, I think, is to stand on 
the verge of the upper and largest fall, and look down through the whole rapid 
descent of the&nbsp;river, as it hurries, foaming, through its rock-worn 
path,--the rocks seeming to have been hewn away, as when mortals make a road. 
These falls are the largest in this State, and have a very peculiar character. 
It seems as if water had had more power at some former period than now, to hew 
and tear its passage through such an immense ledge of rock as here withstood 
it. In this crag, or parts of it, now far beyond the reach of the water, it has 
worn what are called pot-holes,--being circular hollows in the rock, where for 
ages stones have been whirled round and round by the eddies of the water; so 
that the interior of the pot is as circular and as smooth as it could have been 
made by art. Often the mouth of the pot is the narrowest part, the inner space 
being deeply scooped out. Water is contained in most of these pot-holes, 
sometimes so deep that a man might drown himself therein, and lie undetected at 
the bottom. Some of them are of a convenient size for cooking, which might be 
practicable by putting in hot stones.</p> 
<p>The tavern at Shelburne Falls was about the worst I ever saw,--there being 
hardly anything to eat, at least nothing of the meat kind. There was a party of 
students from the Rensselaer school at Troy, who had spent the night there, a 
set of rough urchins, from sixteen to twenty years old, accompanied by the 
wagon-driver, a short, stubbed little fellow, who walked about with great 
independence, thrusting his hands into his breeches-pockets, beneath his frock. 
The queerness was, such a figure being associated with classic youth. They were 
on an excursion which is yearly made from that school in search of minerals. 
They seemed in rather better moral habits than students used to be, but 
wild-spirited, rude, and unpolished, somewhat like&nbsp;German students, which 
resemblance one or two of them increased by smoking pipes. In the morning, my 
breakfast being set in a corner of the same room with them, I saw their 
breakfast-table, with a huge wash-bowl of milk in the centre, and a basin and 
spoon placed for each guest.</p> 
<p>In the bar-room of this tavern were posted up written advertisements, the 
smoked chimney-piece being thus made to serve for a newspaper: &quot;I have rye 
for sale,&quot; &quot;I have a fine mare colt,&quot; etc. There was one 
quaintly expressed advertisement of a horse that had strayed or been stolen 
from a pasture.</p> 
<p>The students, from year to year, have been in search of a particular rock, 
somewhere on the mountains in the vicinity of Shelburne Falls, which is 
supposed to contain some valuable ore; but they cannot find it. One man in the 
bar-room observed that it must be enchanted; and spoke of a tinker, during the 
Revolutionary War, who met with a somewhat similar instance. Roaming along the 
Hudson River, he came to a precipice which had some bunches of singular 
appearance embossed upon it. He knocked off one of the bunches, and carrying it 
home, or to a camp, or wherever he lived, he put it on the fire, and melted it 
down into clear lead. He sought for the spot again and again, but could never 
find it.</p> 
<p>Mr. Leach's brother is a student at Shelburne Falls. He is about 
thirty-five years old, and married; and at this mature age he is studying for 
the ministry, and will not finish his course for two or three years. He was 
bred a farmer, but has sold his farm, and invested the money, and supports 
himself and wife by dentistry during his studies. Many of the academy students 
are men grown, and some, they say, well towards forty&nbsp;years old. Methinks 
this is characteristic of American life,--these rough, weather-beaten, 
hard-handed, farmer-bred students. In nine cases out of ten they are incapable 
of any effectual cultivation; for men of ripe years, if they have any pith in 
them, will have long ago got beyond academy or even college instruction. I 
suspect nothing better than a very wretched smattering is to be obtained in 
these country academies.</p> 
<p>Mr. Jenkins, an instructor at Amherst, speaking of the Western mounds, 
expressed an opinion that they were of the same nature and origin as some small 
circular hills which are of very frequent occurrence here in North Adams. The 
burial-ground is on one of them, and there is another, on the summit of which 
appears a single tombstone, as if there were something natural in making these 
hills the repositories of the dead. A question of old H---- led to Mr. 
Jenkins's dissertation on this subject, to the great contentment of a large 
circle round the bar-room fireside on the last rainy day.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>A tailor is detected by Mr. Leach, because his coat had not a single 
wrinkle in it. I saw him exhibiting patterns of fashions to Randall, the 
village tailor. Mr. Leach has much tact in finding out the professions of 
people. He found out a backsmith, because his right hand was much larger than 
the other.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>A man getting subscriptions for a religious and abolition newspaper in New 
York,--somewhat elderly and gray-haired, quick in his movements, hasty in his 
walk, with an eager, earnest stare through his spectacles, hurrying about with 
a pocket-book of subscriptions in his hand,--seldom speaking, and then in brief
&nbsp;expressions,--sitting down before the stage comes, to write a list of 
subscribers obtained to his employers in New York. Withal, a city and business 
air about him, as of one accustomed to hurry through narrow alleys, and dart 
across thronged streets, and speak hastily to one man and another at jostling 
corners, though now transacting his affairs in the solitude of mountains.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>An old, gray man, seemingly astray and abandoned in this wide world, 
sitting in the bar-room, speaking to none, nor addressed by any one. Not 
understanding the meaning of the supper-bell till asked to supper by word of 
mouth. However, he called for a glass of brandy.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>A pedlar, with girls' neckerchiefs,--or gauze,--men's silk 
pocket-handkerchiefs, red bandannas, and a variety of horn combs, trying to 
trade with the servant-girls of the house. One of them, Laura, attempts to 
exchange a worked vandyke, which she values at two dollars and a half; Eliza, 
being reproached by the pedlar, &quot;vows that she buys more of pedlars than 
any other person in the house.&quot;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>A drove of pigs passing at dusk. They appeared not so much disposed to 
ramble and go astray from the line of march as in daylight, but kept together 
in a pretty compact body. There was a general grunting, not violent at all, but 
low and quiet, as if they were expressing their sentiments among themselves in 
a companionable way. Pigs, on a march, do not subject themselves to any leader 
among themselves, but pass on, higgledy-piggledy, without regard to age or sex.
</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
<p><em>September</em> 1<em>st.</em>--Last evening, during a walk, Graylock and 
the whole of Saddleback were at first imbued with a mild, half-sunshiny tinge, 
then grew almost black,--a huge, dark mass lying on the back of the earth and 
encumbering it. Stretching up from behind the black mountain, over a third or 
more of the sky, there was a heavy, sombre blue heap or ledge of clouds, 
looking almost as solid as rocks. The volumes of which it was composed were 
perceptible by translucent lines and fissures; but the mass, as a whole, seemed 
as solid, bulky, and ponderous in the cloud-world as the mountain was on earth. 
The mountain and cloud together had an indescribably stern and majestic aspect. 
Beneath this heavy cloud, there was a fleet or flock of light, vapory mists, 
flitting in middle air; and these were tinted, from the vanished sun, with the 
most gorgeous and living purple that can be conceived,--a fringe upon the stern 
blue. In the opposite quarter of the heavens, a rose-light was reflected, 
whence I know not, which colored the clouds around the moon, then well above 
the horizon, so that the nearly round and silver moon appeared strangely among 
roseate clouds,--sometimes half obscured by them.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>A man with a smart horse, upon which the landlord makes laudatory remarks. 
He replies that he has &quot;a better at home.&quot; Dressed in a brown, 
bright-buttoned coat, smartly cut. He immediately becomes familiar, and begins 
to talk of the license law, and other similar topics, making himself at home, 
as one who, being much of his time upon the road, finds himself at ease at any 
tavern. He inquired after a stage agent, named Brigham, who formerly resided 
here, but now&nbsp;has gone to the West. He himself was probably a horse-jockey.
</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>An old lady, stopping here over the Sabbath, waiting for to-morrow's stage 
for Greenfield, having been deceived by the idea that she could proceed on her 
journey without delay. Quiet, making herself comfortable, taken into the 
society of the women of the house.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><em>September</em> 3<em>d.</em>--On the slope of Bald Mountain a clearing, 
set in the frame of the forest on all sides,--a growth of clover upon it, 
which, having been mowed once this year, is now appropriated to pasturage. 
Stumps remaining in the ground; one tall, barkless stem of a tree standing 
upright, branchless, and with a shattered summit. One or two other stems lying 
prostrate and partly overgrown with bushes and shrubbery, some of them bearing 
a yellow flower,--a color which Autumn loves. The stumps and trunks 
fire-blackened, yet nothing about them that indicates a recent clearing, but 
the roughness of an old clearing, that, being removed from convenient labor, 
has none of the polish of the homestead. The field, with slight undulations, 
slopes pretty directly down. Near the lower verge, a rude sort of barn, or 
rather haystack roofed over, and with hay protruding and hanging out. An ox 
feeding, and putting up his muzzle to pull down a mouthful of hay; but seeing 
me, a stranger, in the upper part of the field, he remains long gazing, and 
finally betakes himself to feeding again. A solitary butterfly flitting to and 
fro, blown slightly on its course by a cool September wind,--the coolness of 
which begins to be tempered by a bright, glittering sun. There is dew on the 
grass. In front, beyond&nbsp;the lower spread of forest, Saddle Mountain rises, 
and the valleys, and long, swelling hills sweep away. But the impression of 
this clearing is solitude, as of a forgotten land.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>It is customary here to toll the bell at the death of a person, at the hour 
of his death, whether A.M. or P.M. Not, however, I suppose, if it happen in 
deep night.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&quot;There are three times in a man's life when he is talked about,--when 
he is born, when he is married, and when he dies.&quot; &quot;Yes,&quot; said 
Orrin S----, &quot;and only one of the times has he to pay anything for it out 
of his own pocket.&quot; (In reference to a claim by the guests of the bar-room 
on the man Amasa Richardson for a treat.)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>A wood-chopper, travelling the country in search of jobs at chopping. His 
baggage a bundle, a handkerchief, and a pair of coarse boots. His implement an 
axe, most keenly ground and sharpened, which I had noticed standing in a 
corner, and thought it would almost serve as a razor. I saw another 
wood-chopper sitting down on the ascent of Bald Mountain, with his axe on one 
side and a jug and provisions on the other, on the way to his day's toil.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The Revolutionary pensioners come out into the sunshine to make oath that 
they are still above ground. One, whom Mr. S---- saluted as &quot;Uncle 
John,&quot; went into the bar-room, walking pretty stoutly by the aid of a 
long, oaken staff,--with an old, creased, broken and ashen bell-crowned hat on 
his head, and wearing&nbsp;a brown, old-fashioned suit of clothes. Pretty 
portly, fleshy in the face, and with somewhat of a paunch, cheerful, and his 
senses, bodily and mental, in no very bad order, though he is now in his 
ninetieth year. &quot;An old withered and wilted apple,&quot; quoth Uncle John, 
&quot;keeps a good while.&quot; Mr. S---- says his grandfather lived to be a 
hundred, and that his legs became covered with moss, like the trunk of an old 
tree. Uncle John would smile and cackle at a little jest, and what life there 
was in him seemed a good-natured and comfortable one enough. He can walk two or 
three miles, he says, &quot;taking it moderate.&quot; I suppose his state is 
that of a drowsy man but partly conscious of life,--walking as through a dim 
dream, but brighter at some seasons than at others. By and by he will fall 
quite asleep, without any trouble. Mr. S----, unbidden, gave him a glass of 
gin, which the old man imbibed by the warm fireside, and grew the younger for 
it.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><em>September</em> 4<em>th.</em>--This day an exhibition of animals in the 
vicinity of the village, under a pavilion of sail-cloth,--the floor being the 
natural grass, with here and there a rock partially protruding. A pleasant, 
mild shade; a strip of sunshine or a spot of glimmering brightness in some 
parts. Crowded,--row above row of women, on an amphitheatre of seats, on one 
side. In an inner pavilion an exhibition of anacondas,--four,--which the 
showman took, one by one, from a large box, under some blankets, and hung round 
his shoulders. They seemed almost torpid when first taken out, but gradually 
began to assume life, to stretch, to contract, twine and writhe about his neck 
and person, thrusting out their tongues and&nbsp;erecting their heads. Their 
weight was as much as he could bear, and they hung down almost to the ground 
when not contorted,--as big round as a man's thigh, almost,--spotted and richly 
variegated. Then he put them into the box again, their heads emerging and 
writhing forth, which the showman thrust back again. He gave a descriptive and 
historical account of them, and a fanciful and poetical one also. A man put his 
arm and head into the lion's mouth,--all the spectators looking on so 
attentively that a breath could not be heard. That was impressive,--its effect 
on a thousand persons,--more so than the thing itself.</p> 
<p>In the evening the caravan people were at the tavern, talking of their 
troubles in coming over the mountain,--the overturn of a cage containing two 
leopards and a hyena. They are a rough, ignorant set of men, apparently 
incapable of taking any particular enjoyment from the life of variety and 
adventure which they lead. There was the man who put his head into the lion's 
mouth, and, I suppose, the man about whom the anacondas twined, talking about 
their suppers, and blustering for hot meat, and calling for something to drink, 
without anything of the wild dignity of men familiar with the nobility of 
nature.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>A character of a desperate young man, who employs high courage and strong 
faculties in this sort of dangers, and wastes his talents in wild riot, 
addressing the audience as a snake-man,--keeping the ring while the monkey 
rides the pony,--singing negro and other songs.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The country boors were continually getting within the&nbsp;barriers, and 
venturing too near the cages . The great lion lay with his fore paws extended, 
and a calm, majestic, but awful countenance. He looked on the people as if he 
had seen many such concourses. The hyena was the most ugly and dangerous 
looking beast, full of spite, and on ill terms with all nature, looking a good 
deal like a hog with the devil in him, the ridge of hair along his back 
bristling. He was in the cage with a leopard and a panther, and the latter 
seemed continually on the point of laying his paw on the hyena, who snarled, 
and showed his teeth. It is strange, though, to see how these wild beasts 
acknowledge and practise a degree of mutual forbearance, and of obedience to 
man, with their wild nature yet in them. The great white bear seemed in 
distress from the heat, moving his head and body in a peculiar, fantastic way, 
and eagerly drinking water when given it. He was thin and lank.</p> 
<p>The caravan men were so sleepy, Orrin S---- says, that he could hardly wake 
them in the morning. They turned over on their faces to show him.</p> 
<p>Coming out of the caravansary, there were the mountains, in the quiet 
sunset, and many men drunk, swearing, and fighting. Shanties with liquor for 
sale.</p> 
<p>The elephant lodged in the barn.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><em>September</em> 5<em>th.</em>--I took a walk of three miles from the 
village, which brought me into Vermont. The line runs athwart a bridge,--a rude 
bridge, which crosses a mountain stream. The stream runs deep at the bottom of 
a gorge, plashing downward, with rapids and pools, and bestrewn with large 
rocks, deep and shady, not to be reached by the sun except in its meridian, as 
well on account of the depth of the gorge&nbsp;as of the arch of wilderness 
trees above it. There was a stumpy clearing beyond the bridge, where some men 
were building a house. I went to them, and inquired if I were in Massachusetts 
or Vermont, and asked for some water. Whereupon they showed great hospitality, 
and the master-workman went to the spring, and brought delicious water in a tin 
basin, and produced another jug containing &quot;new rum, and very good; and 
rum does nobody any harm if they make a good use of it,&quot; quoth he. I 
invited them to call on me at the hotel, if they should come to the village 
within two or three days. Then I took my way back through the forest, for this 
is a by-road, and is, much of its course, a sequestrated and wild one, with an 
unseen torrent roaring at an unseen depth, along the roadside.</p> 
<p>My walk forth had been an almost continued ascent, and, returning, I had an 
excellent view of Graylock and the adjacent mountains, at such a distance that 
they were all brought into one group, and comprehended at one view, as 
belonging to the same company,--all mighty, with a mightier chief. As I drew 
nearer home, they separated, and the unity of effect was lost. The more distant 
then disappeared behind the nearer ones, and finally Graylock itself was lost 
behind the hill which immediately shuts in the village. There was a warm, 
autumnal haze, which, I think, seemed to throw the mountains farther off, and 
both to enlarge and soften them.</p> 
<p>To imagine the gorges and deep hollows in among the group of 
mountains,--their huge shoulders and protrusions.</p> 
<p>&quot;They were just beginning to pitch over the mountains, as I came 
along,&quot;--stage-driver's expression about the caravan.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>A fantastic figure of a village coxcomb, striding through the bar-room, and 
standing with folded arms to survey the caravan men. There is much exaggeration 
and rattle-brain about this fellow.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>A mad girl leaped from the top of a tremendous precipice in Pownall, 
hundreds of feet high, if the tale be true, and, being buoyed up by her 
clothes, came safely to the bottom.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Inquiries about the coming of the caravan, and whether the elephant had got 
to town, and reports that he had.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>A smart, plump, crimson-faced gentleman, with a travelling-portmanteau of 
peculiar neatness and convenience. He criticises the road over the mountain, 
having come in the Greenfleld stage; perhaps an engineer.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Bears still inhabit Saddleback and the neighboring mountains and forests. 
Six were taken in Pownall last year, and two hundred foxes. Sometimes they 
appear on the hills, in close proximity to this village.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><em>September</em> 7<em>th.</em>--Mr. Leach and I took a walk by moonlight 
last evening, on the road that leads over the mountain. Remote from houses, far 
up on the hill-side, we found a lime-kiln, burning near the road; and, 
approaching it, a watcher started from the ground, where he had been lying at 
his length. There are several of these lime-kilns in this vicinity. They are 
circular, built with stones, like a round tower, eighteen or twenty feet high, 
having a hillock heaped around in&nbsp;a great portion of their circumference, 
so that the marble may be brought and thrown in by cart-loads at the top. At 
the bottom there is a doorway, large enough to admit a man in a stooping 
posture. Thus an edifice of great solidity is constructed, which will endure 
for centuries, unless needless pains are taken to tear it down. There is one on 
the hill-side, close to the village, wherein weeds grow at the bottom, and 
grass and shrubs too are rooted in the interstices of the stones, and its low 
doorway has a dungeon-like aspect, and we look down from the top as into a 
roofless tower. It apparently has not been used for many years, and the lime 
and weather-stained fragments of marble are scattered about.</p> 
<p>But in the one we saw last night a hard-wood fire was burning merrily, 
beneath the superincumbent marble,--the kiln being heaped full; and shortly 
after we came, the man (a dark, black-bearded figure, in shirtsleeves) opened 
the iron door, through the chinks of which the fire was gleaming, and thrust in 
huge logs of wood, and stirred the immense coals with a long pole, and showed 
us the glowing limestone,--the lower layer of it. The heat of the fire was 
powerful, at the distance of several yards from the open door. He talked very 
sensibly with us, being doubtless glad to have two visitors to vary his 
solitary night-watch; for it would not do for him to fall asleep, since the 
fire should be refreshed as often as every twenty minutes. We ascended the 
hillock to the top of the kiln, and the marble was red-hot, and burning with a 
bluish, lambent flame, quivering up, sometimes nearly a yard high, and 
resembling the flame of anthracite coal, only, the marble being in large 
fragments, the flame was higher. The kiln was perhaps six or eight feet across.
&nbsp;Four hundred bushels of marble were then in a state of combustion. The 
expense of converting this quantity into lime is about fifty dollars, and it 
sells for twenty-five cents per bushel at the kiln. We asked the man whether he 
would run across the top of the intensely burning kiln, barefooted, for a 
thousand dollars; and he said he would for ten. He told us that the lime had 
been burning forty-eight hours, and would be finished in thirty-six more. He 
liked the business of watching it better by night than by day; because the days 
were often hot, but such a mild and beautiful night as the last was just right. 
Here a poet might make verses with moonlight in them, and a gleam of fierce 
fire-light flickering through. It is a shame to use this brilliant, white, 
almost transparent marble in this way. A man said of it, the other day, that 
into some pieces of it, when polished, one could see a good distance; and he 
instanced a certain gravestone.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Visited the cave. A large portion of it, where water trickles and falls, is 
perfectly white. The walls present a specimen of how Nature packs the stone, 
crowding huge masses, as it were, into chinks and fissures, and here we see it 
in the perpendicular or horizontal layers, as Nature laid it.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><em>September</em> 9<em>th.</em>--A walk yesterday forenoon through the 
Notch, formed between Saddle Mountain and another adjacent one. This Notch is 
otherwise called the Bellowspipe, being a long and narrow valley, with a steep 
wall on either side. The walls are very high, and the fallen timbers lie 
strewed adown the precipitous descent. The valley gradually descends from the
&nbsp;narrowest part of the Notch, and a stream of water flows through the 
midst of it, which, farther onward in its course, turns a mill. The valley is 
cultivated, there being two or three farm-houses towards the northern end, and 
extensive fields of grass beyond, where stand the hay-mows of last year, with 
the hay cut away regularly around their bases. All the more distant portion of 
the valley is lonesome in the extreme; and on the hither side of the narrowest 
part the land is uncultivated, partly overgrown with forest, partly used as 
sheep-pastures, for which purpose it is not nearly so barren as sheep-pastures 
usually are. On the right, facing southward, rises Graylock, all beshagged with 
forest, and with headlong precipices of rock appearing among the black pines. 
Southward there is a most extensive view of the valley, in which Saddleback and 
its companion mountains are crouched,--wide and far,--a broad, misty valley, 
fenced in by a mountain wall, and with villages scattered along it, and miles 
of forest, which appear but as patches scattered here and there upon the 
landscape. The descent from the Notch southward is much more abrupt than on the 
other side. A stream flows down through it; and along much of its course it has 
washed away all the earth from a ledge of rock, and then formed a descending 
pavement, smooth and regular, which the scanty flow of water scarcely suffices 
to moisten at this period, though a heavy rain, probably, would send down a 
torrent, raging, roaring, and foaming. I descended along the course of the 
stream, and sometimes on the rocky path of it, and, turning off towards the 
south village, followed a cattle-path till I came to a cottage.</p> 
<p>A horse was standing saddled near the door, but I did not see the rider. I 
knocked, and an elderly&nbsp;woman, of very pleasing and intelligent aspect, 
came at the summons, and gave me directions how to get to the south village 
through an orchard and &quot;across lots,&quot; which would bring me into the 
road near the Quaker meeting-house, with gravestones round it. While she 
talked, a young woman came into the pantry from the kitchen, with a dirty 
little brat, whose squalls I had heard all along; the reason of his outcry 
being that his mother was washing him,--a very unusual process, if I may judge 
by his looks. I asked the old lady for some water, and she gave me, I think, 
the most delicious I ever tasted. These mountaineers ought certainly to be 
temperance people; for their mountain springs supply them with a liquor of 
which the cities and the low countries can have no conception. Pure, fresh, 
almost sparkling, exhilarating,--such water as Adam and Eve drank.</p> 
<p>I passed the south village on a by-road, without entering it, and was taken 
up by the stage from Pittsfield a mile or two this side of it. Platt, the 
driver, a friend of mine, talked familiarly about many matters, intermixing his 
talk with remarks on his team and addresses to the beasts composing it, who 
were three mares, and a horse on the near wheel,--all bays. The horse he 
pronounced &quot;a dreadful nice horse to go; but if he could shirk off the 
work upon the others, he would,&quot;--which unfairness Platt corrected by 
timely strokes of the whip whenever the horse's traces were not tightened. One 
of the mares wished to go faster, hearing another horse tramp behind her; 
&quot;and nothing made her so mad,&quot; quoth Platt, &quot;as to be held in 
when she wanted to go.&quot; The near leader started. &quot;Oh the little 
devil,&quot; said he, &quot;how skittish she is!&quot; Another stumbled, and 
Platt bantered her&nbsp;thereupon. Then he told of floundering through 
snow-drifts in winter, and carrying the mail on his back four miles from 
Bennington. And thus we jogged on, and got to &quot;mine inn&quot; just as the 
dinner-bell was ringing.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Pig-drover, with two hundred pigs. They are much more easily driven on 
rainy days than on fair ones. One of his pigs, a large one, particularly 
troublesome as to running off the road towards every object, and leading the 
drove. Thirteen miles about a day's journey, in the course of which the drover 
has to travel about thirty.</p> 
<p>They have a dog, who runs to and fro indefatigably, barking at those who 
straggle on the flanks of the line of march, then scampering to the other side 
and barking there, and sometimes having quite an affair of barking and surly 
grunting with some refractory pig, who has found something to munch, and 
refuses to quit it. The pigs are fed on corn at their halts. The drove has some 
ultimate market, and individuals are peddled out on the march. Some die.</p> 
<p>Merino sheep (which are much raised in Berkshire) are good for hardly 
anything to eat,--a fair-sized quarter dwindling down to almost nothing in the 
process of roasting.</p> 
<p>The tavern-keeper in Stockbridge, an elderly bachelor,--a dusty, 
black-dressed, antiquated figure, with a white neck-cloth setting off a dim, 
yellow complex-looking like one of the old wax-figures of ministers in a corner 
of the New England Museum. He did not seem old, but like a middle-aged man, who 
had been preserved in some dark and cobwebby corner for a great while. He is 
asthmatic.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>In Connecticut, and also sometimes in Berkshire, the villages are situated 
on the most elevated ground that can be found, so that they are visible for 
miles around. Litchfield is a remarkable instance, occupying a high plain, 
without the least shelter from the winds, and with almost as wide an expanse of 
view as from a mountain-top. The streets are very wide,--two or three hundred 
feet, at least,--with wide, green margins, and sometimes there is a wide green 
space between two road tracks. Nothing can be neater than the churches and 
houses. The graveyard is on the slope, and at the foot of a swell, filled with 
old and new gravestones, some of red freestone, some of gray granite, most of 
them of white marble, and one of cast-iron with an inscription of raised 
letters. There was one of the date of about 1776, on which was represented the 
third-length, bas-relief portrait of a gentleman in a wig and other costume of 
that day; and as a framework about this portrait was wreathed a garland of 
vine-leaves and heavy clusters of grapes. The deceased should have been a jolly 
bottleman; but the epitaph indicated nothing of the kind.</p> 
<p>In a remote part of the graveyard,--remote from the main body of dead 
people,--I noticed a humble, mossy stone, on which I traced out &quot;To the 
memory of Julia Africa, servant of Rev.&quot; somebody. There were also the 
half-obliterated traces of other graves, without any monuments, in the vicinity 
of this one. Doubtless the slaves here mingled their dark clay with the earth.
</p> 
<p>At Litchfield there is a doctor who undertakes to cure deformed 
people,--and humpbacked, lame, and otherwise defective folk go there. Besides 
these, there were many ladies and others boarding there, for the benefit of the 
air, I suppose.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>At Canaan, Connecticut, before the tavern, there is a doorstep, two or 
three paces large in each of its dimensions; and on this is inscribed the date 
when the builder of the house came to the town,--namely, 1731. The house was 
built in 1751. Then follows the age and death of the patriarch (at over ninety) 
and his wife, and the births of, I think, eleven sons and daughters. It would 
seem as if they were buried underneath; and many people take that idea. It is 
odd to put a family record in a spot where it is sure to be trampled underfoot.
</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>At Springfield, a blind man, who came in the stage,--elderly,--sitting in 
the reading-room, and, as soon as seated, feeling all around him with his cane, 
so as to find out his locality, and know where he may spit with safety! The 
cautious and scientific air with which he measures his distances. Then he sits 
still and silent a long while,--then inquires the hour,--then says, &quot;I 
should like to go to bed.&quot; Nobody of the house being near, he receives no 
answer, and repeats impatiently, &quot;I'll go to bed.&quot; One would suppose, 
that, conscious of his dependent condition, he would have learned a different 
sort of manner; but probably he has lived where he could command attention.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Two travellers, eating bread and cheese of their own in the bar-room at 
Stockbridge, and drinking water out of a tumbler borrowed from the landlord. 
Eating immensely, and, when satisfied, putting the relics in their trunk, and 
rubbing down the table.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Sample ears of various kinds of corn hanging over&nbsp;the looking-glass or 
in the bars of taverns. Four ears on a stalk (good ones) are considered a heavy 
harvest.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>A withered, yellow, sodden, dead-alive looking woman,--an opium-eater. A 
deaf man, with a great fancy for conversation, so that his interlocutor is 
compelled to halloo and bawl over the rumbling of the coach, amid which he 
hears best. The sharp tones of a woman s voice appear to pierce his dull organs 
much better than a masculine voice. The impossibility of saying anything but 
commonplace matters to a deaf man, of expressing any delicacy of thought in a 
raised tone, of giving utterance to fine feelings in a bawl. This man's 
deafness seemed to have made his mind and feelings uncommonly coarse; for, 
after the opium-eater had renewed an old acquaintance with him, almost the 
first question he asked, in his raised voice, was, &quot;Do you eat opium 
now?&quot;</p> 
<p>At Hartford, the keeper of a temperance hotel reading a Hebrew Bible in the 
bar by means of a lexicon and an English version.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>A negro, respectably dressed, and well-mounted on horseback, travelling on 
his own hook, calling for oats, and drinking a glass of brandy-and-water at the 
bar, like any other Christian. A young man from Wisconsin said, &quot;I wish I 
had a thousand such fellows in Alabama.&quot; It made a strange impression on 
me,--the negro was really so human!--and to talk of owning a thousand like him!

<p><em>October</em> 24<em>th.</em>--View from a chamber of the Tremont of the 
brick edifice opposite, on the other side of Beacon Street. At one of the lower 
windows, a woman at work; at one above, a lady hemming a ruff or some such 
lady-like thing. She is pretty, young, and married; for a little boy comes to 
her knees, and she parts his hair, and caresses him in a motherly way. A note 
on colored paper is brought her; and she reads it, and puts it in her bosom. At 
another window, at some depth within the apartment, a gentleman in a 
dressing-gown, reading, and rocking in an easy-chair, etc., etc., etc. A rainy 
day, and people passing with umbrellas disconsolately between the spectator and 
these various scenes of indoor occupation and comfort. With this sketch might 
be mingled and worked up some story that was going on within the chamber where 
the spectator was situated.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>All the dead that had ever been drowned in a certain lake to arise.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The history of a small lake from the first, till it was drained,</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>An autumnal feature,--boys had swept together the fallen leaves from the 
elms along the street in one huge pile, and had made a hollow, nest-shaped, in 
this pile, in which three or four of them lay curled, like young birds.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>A tombstone-maker, whom Miss B---y knew, used to cut cherubs on the top of 
the tombstones, and had the art of carving the cherubs' faces in the likeness

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
<p>A child of Rev. E. P---- was threatened with total blindness. A week after 
the father had been informed of this, the child died; and, in the mean while, 
his feelings had become so much the more interested in the child, from its 
threatened blindness, that it was infinitely harder to give it up. Had he not 
been aware of it till after the child's death, it would probably have been a 
consolation.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Singular character of a gentleman (H. H---- Esq.) living in retirement in 
Boston,--esteemed a man of nicest honor, and his seclusion attributed to 
wounded feelings on account of the failure of his firm in business. Yet it was 
discovered that this man had been the mover of intrigues by which men in 
business had been ruined, and their property absorbed, none knew how or by 
whom; love-affairs had been broken off, and much other mischief done; and for 
years he was not in the least suspected. He died suddenly, soon after suspicion 
fell upon him. Probably it was the love of management, of having an influence 
on affairs, that produced these phenomena.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Character of a man who, in himself and his external circumstances, shall be 
equally and totally false: his fortune resting on baseless credit,--his 
patriotism assumed,--his domestic affections, his honor and honesty, all a 
sham. His own misery in the midst of it,--it making the whole universe, heaven 
and earth alike, an unsubstantial mockery to him.</p>

<p>Dr. Johnson's penance in Uttoxeter Market. A man who does penance in what

a penance and torture to him on account of some fundamental error in early life.

<p>Thanksgiving at the Worcester Lunatic Asylum. A ball and dance of the 
inmates in the evening,--a furious lunatic dancing with the principal's wife. 
Thanksgiving in an almshouse might make a better sketch.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The house on the eastern corner of North and Essex Streets [Salem], 
supposed to have been built about 1640, had, say sixty years later, a brick 
turret erected, wherein one of the ancestors of the present occupants used to 
practise alchemy. He was the operative of a scientific person in Boston, the 
director. There have been other alchemists of old in this town,--one who kept 
his fire burning seven weeks, and then lost the elixir by letting it go out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>An ancient wineglass (Miss Ingersol's), long-stalked, with a small, 
cup-like bowl, round which is wreathed a branch of grape-vine, with a rich

flying. The whole is excellently cut or engraved.</p>

<p>H. L. C---- heard from a French Canadian a story of a young couple in 
Acadie. On their marriage day, all the men of the Province were summoned to 
assemble in the church to hear a proclamation. When assembled, they were all 
seized and shipped off to be distributed through New England,--among them the 
new bridegroom. His bride set off in search of him,--wandered about New England 
all her lifetime, and at last, when she was old, she found her bridegroom on 
his death-bed. The shock was so great that it killed her likewise.</p>

earth being so intermixed with sky, and gradually transformed into it.</p>

<p>A stranger, dying, is buried; and after many years two strangers come in 
search of his grave, and open it.</p>

<p>The strange sensation of a person who feels himself an object of deep

<p>Letters in the shape of figures of men, etc. At a distance, the words 
composed by the letters are alone distinguishable. Close at hand, the figures 
alone are seen, and not distinguished as letters. Thus things may have a 
positive, a relative, and a composite meaning, according to the point of view.

<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&quot;Passing along the street, all muddy with puddles,&nbsp;and suddenly 
seeing the sky reflected in these puddles in such a way as quite to conceal the 
foulness of the street.&quot;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>A young man in search of happiness,--to be personified by a figure whom he 
expects to meet in a crowd, and is to be recognized by certain signs. All these 
signs are given by a figure in various garbs and actions, but he does not 
recognize that this is the sought-for person till too late.</p>

<p>If cities were built by the sound of music, then some edifices would appear 
to be constructed by grave, solemn tones,--others to have danced forth to

<p>Familiar spirits, according to Lilly, used to be worn in rings, watches, 
sword-hilts. Thumb-rings were set with jewels of extraordinary size.</p>

<p>A very fanciful person, when dead, to have his burial in a cloud.</p>

<p>Dialogues of the unborn, like dialogues of the dead,--or between two young

<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>A mortal symptom for a person being to lose his own aspect and to take the 
family lineaments, which were hidden deep in the healthful visage. Perhaps a
&nbsp;seeker might thus recognize the man he had sought, after long intercourse 
with him unknowingly.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Some moderns to build a fire on Ararat with the remnants of the ark.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Two little boats of cork, with a magnet in one and steel in the other.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>To have ice in one's blood.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>To make a story of all strange and impossible things,--as the Salamander, 
the Phoenix.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The semblance of a human face to be formed on the side of a mountain, or in 
the fracture of a small stone, by alusus natur&aelig;. The face is an object of 
curiosity for years or centuries, and by and by a boy is born, whose features 
gradually assume the aspect of that portrait. At some critical juncture, the 
resemblance is found to be perfect. A prophecy may be connected.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>A person to be the death of his beloved in trying to raise her to more than 
mortal perfection; yet this should be a comfort to him for having aimed so 
highly and holily.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Some most secret thing, valued and honored between lovers, to be hung up in 
public places, and&nbsp;made the subject of remark by the city,--remarks, 
sneers, and laughter.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>To make a story out of a scarecrow, giving it odd attributes. From 
different points of view, it should appear to change,--now an old man, now an 
old woman,--a gunner, a farmer, or the Old Nick.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>A ground-sparrow's nest in the slope of a bank, brought to view by mowing 
the grass, but still sheltered and comfortably hidden by a blackberry-vine 
trailing over it. At first, four brown-speckled eggs,--then two little bare 
young ones, which, on the slightest noise, lift their heads, and open wide 
mouths for food,--immediately dropping their heads, after a broad gape. The 
action looks as if they were making a most earnest, agonized petition. In 
another egg, as in a coffin, I could discern the quiet, death-like form of the 
little bird. The whole thing had something awful and mysterious in it.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>A coroner's inquest on a murdered man,--the gathering of the jury to be 
described, and the characters of the members,--some with secret guilt upon 
their souls.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>To represent a man as spending life and the intensest labor in the 
accomplishment of some mechanical trifle,--as in making a miniature coach to be 
drawn by fleas, or a dinner-service to be put into a cherry-stone.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>A bonfire to be made of the gallows and of all symbols of evil.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The love of posterity is a consequence of the necessity of death. If a man 
were sure of living forever here, he would not care about his offspring.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The device of a sundial for a monument over a grave, with some suitable 
motto.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>A man with the right perception of things,--a feeling within him of what is 
true and what is false. It might be symbolized by the talisman with which, in 
fairy tales, an adventurer was enabled to distinguish enchantments from 
realities.</p>

<p>---- taking my likeness, I said that such changes would come over my face 
that she would not know me when we met again in heaven. &quot;See if I do

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
<p>EXTRACTS FROM HIS PRIVATE LETTERS.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Boston, <em>July</em> 3<em>d,</em> 1839.--I do not mean to imply that I am 
unhappy or discontented, for this is not the case. My life only is a burden in 
the same way that it is to every toilsome man; and mine is a healthy weariness, 
such as needs only a night's sleep to remove it. But from henceforth forever I 
shall be entitled to call the sons of toil my brethren, and shall know how to 
sympathize with them, seeing that I likewise have risen at the dawn, and borne 
the fervor of the midday sun, nor turned my heavy footsteps homeward till 
eventide. Years hence, perhaps, the experience that my heart is acquiring now 
will flow out in truth and wisdom.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><em>August</em> 27<em>th.</em>--I have been stationed all day at the end of 
Long Wharf, and I rather think that I had the most eligible situation of 
anybody in Boston. I was aware that it must be intensely hot in the midst of 
the city; but there was only a short space of uncomfortable heat in my region, 
half-way towards the centre of the harbor; and almost all the time there was a 
pure and delightful breeze, fluttering and palpitating, sometimes shyly kissing 
my brow, then dying away, and then rushing upon me in livelier sport, so that I 
was fain to settle my straw hat more tightly upon my head. Late in the 
afternoon, there was a sunny shower, which came down so like a benediction that 
it seemed ungrateful to take shelter in the cabin or to put up an umbrella. 
Then there was a rainbow, or a large segment of one, so exceedingly brilliant 
and of such long endurance that I almost fancied it was stained into the sky, 
and would continue there&nbsp;permanently. And there were clouds floating all 
about,--great clouds and small, of all glorious and lovely hues (save that 
imperial crimson which was revealed to our united gaze),--so glorious, indeed, 
and so lovely, that I had a fantasy of heaven's being broken into fleecy 
fragments and dispersed through space, with its blest inhabitants dwelling 
blissfully upon those scattered islands.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<h3>[1840]</h3> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><em>February</em> 7<em>th,</em> 1840.--What beautiful weather this 
is!--beautiful, at least, so far as sun, sky, and atmosphere are concerned, 
though a poor, wingless biped is sometimes constrained to wish that he could 
raise himself a little above the earth. How much mud and mire, how many pools 
of unclean water, how many slippery footsteps, and perchance heavy tumbles, 
might be avoided, if we could tread but six inches above the crust of this 
world. Physically we cannot do this; our bodies cannot; but it seems to me that 
our hearts and minds may keep themselves above moral mud-puddles and other 
discomforts of the soul's pathway.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><em>February</em> 11<em>th.</em>--I have been measuring coal all day, on 
board of a black little British schooner, in a dismal dock at the north end of 
the city. Most of the time I paced the deck to keep myself warm; for the wind 
(northeast, I believe) blew up through the dock, as if it had been the pipe of 
a pair of bellows. The vessel lying deep between two wharves, there was no more 
delightful prospect, on the right hand and on the left, than the posts and 
timbers, half immersed in the water, and covered with ice, which the rising and 
falling of successive tides had left upon them, so that they looked like 
immense icicles. Across the water,&nbsp;however, not more than half a mile off, 
appeared the Bunker Hill Monument; and, what interested me considerably more, a 
church-steeple, with the dial of a clock upon it, whereby I was enabled to 
measure the march of the weary hours. Sometimes I descended into the dirty 
little cabin of the schooner, and warmed myself by a red-hot stove, among 
biscuit-barrels, pots and kettles, sea-chests, and innumerable lumber of all 
sorts,--my olfactories, meanwhile, being greatly refreshed by the odor of a 
pipe, which the captain, or some one of his crew, was smoking. But at last came 
the sunset, with delicate clouds, and a purple light upon the islands; and I 
blessed it, because it was the signal of my release.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><em>February</em> 12<em>th.</em>--All day long again have I been engaged in 
a very black business,--as black as a coal; and, though my face and hands have 
undergone a thorough purification, I feel not altogether fit to hold communion 
with doves. Methinks my profession is somewhat akin to that of a 
chimney-sweeper; but the latter has the advantage over me, because, after 
climbing up through the darksome flue of the chimney, he emerges into the midst 
of the golden air, and sings out his melodies far over the heads of the whole 
tribe of weary earth-plodders. My toil to-day has been cold and dull enough; 
nevertheless, I was neither cold nor dull.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><em>March</em> 15<em>th.</em>--I pray that in one year more I may find some 
way of escaping from this unblest Custom House; for it is a very grievous 
thraldom. I do detest all offices,--all, at least, that are held on a political 
tenure. And I want nothing to do with&nbsp;politicians. Their hearts wither 
away and die out of their bodies. Their consciences are turned to india-rubber, 
or to some substance as black as that, and which will stretch as much. One 
thing, if no more, I have gained by my custom house experience,--to know a 
politician. It is a knowledge which no previous thought or power of sympathy 
could have taught me, because the animal, or the machine rather, is not in 
nature.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><em>March</em> 23<em>d.</em>--I do think that it is the doom laid upon me, 
of murdering so many of the brightest hours of the day at the Custom House, 
that makes such havoc with my wits, for here I am again trying to write 
worthily, . . . yet with a sense as if all the noblest part of man had been 
left out of my composition, or had decayed out of it since my nature was given 
to my own keeping. . . . Never comes any bird of Paradise into that dismal 
region. A salt or even a coal ship is ten million times preferable; for there 
the sky is above me, and the fresh breeze around me, and my thoughts, having 
hardly anything to do with my occupation, are as free as air.</p> 
<p>Nevertheless, you are not to fancy that the above paragraph gives a correct 
idea of my mental and spiritual state. . . . It is only once in a while that 
the image and desire of a better and happier life makes me feel the iron of my 
chain; for, after all, a human spirit may find no insufficiency of food fit for 
it, even in the Custom House. And, with such materials as these, I do think and 
feel and learn things that are worth knowing, and which I should not know 
unless I had learned them there, so that the present portion of my life shall 
not be quite left out of the sum of my real existence. . . . It is good for me, 
on many&nbsp;accounts, that my life has had this passage in it. I know much 
more than I did a year ago. I have a stronger sense of power to act as a man 
among men. I have gained worldly wisdom, and wisdom also that is not altogether 
of this world. And, when I quit this earthly cavern where I am now buried, 
nothing will cling to me that ought to be left behind. Men will not perceive, I 
trust, by my look, or the tenor of my thoughts and feelings, that I have been a 
custom house officer.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><em>April</em> 7<em>th.</em>--It appears to me to have been the most 
uncomfortable day that ever was inflicted on poor mortals. . . . Besides the 
bleak, unkindly air, I have been plagued by two sets of coal-shovelers at the 
same time, and have been obliged to keep two separate tallies simultaneously. 
But I was conscious that all this was merely a vision and a fantasy, and that, 
in reality, I was not half frozen by the bitter blast, nor tormented by those 
grimy coal-heavers, but that I was basking quietly in the sunshine of eternity, 
. . . Any sort of bodily and earthly torment may serve to make us sensible that 
we have a soul that is not within the jurisdiction of such shadowy demons,--it 
separates the immortal within us from the mortal. But the wind has blown my 
brains into such confusion that I cannot philosophize now.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><em>April</em> 19<em>th.</em>--. . . What a beautiful day was yesterday! My 
spirit rebelled against being confined in my darksome dungeon at the Custom 
House. It seemed a sin,--a murder of the joyful young day,--a quenching of the 
sunshine. Nevertheless, there I was kept a prisoner till it was too late to 
fling myself&nbsp;on a gentle wind, and be blown away into the country. . . . 
When I shall be again free, I will enjoy all things with the fresh simplicity 
of a child of five years old. I shall grow young again, made all over anew. I 
will go forth and stand in a summer shower, and all the worldly dust that has 
collected on me shall be washed away at once, and my heart will be like a bank 
of fresh flowers for the weary to rest upon. . . .</p> 
<p>6 P.M.--I went out to walk about an hour ago, and found it very pleasant, 
though there was a somewhat cool wind. I went round and across the Common, and 
stood on the highest point of it, where I could see miles and miles into the 
country. Blessed be God for this green tract, and the view which it affords, 
whereby we poor citizens may be put in mind, sometimes, that all his earth is 
not composed of blocks of brick houses, and of stone or wooden pavements. 
Blessed be God for the sky, too, though the smoke of the city may somewhat 
change its aspect,--but still it is better than if each street were covered 
over with a roof. There were a good many people walking on the mall,--mechanics 
apparently, and shopkeepers' clerks, with their wives; and boys were rolling on 
the grass, and I would have liked to lie down and roll too.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><em>April</em> 30<em>th.</em>--. . . I arose this morning feeling more 
elastic than I have throughout the winter; for the breathing of the ocean air 
has wrought a very beneficial effect, . . . What a beautiful, most beautiful 
afternoon this has been! It was a real happiness to live. If I had been merely 
a vegetable,--a hawthorn-bush, for instance,--I must have been happy in such an 
air and sunshine; but, having a mind and a soul, . . . I enjoyed somewhat more 
than mere&nbsp;vegetable happiness. . . . The footsteps of May can be traced 
upon the islands in the harbor, and I have been watching the tints of green 
upon them gradually deepening, till now they are almost as beautiful as they 
ever can be.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><em>May</em> 19<em>th.</em>--. . . Lights and shadows are continually 
flitting across my inward sky, and I know neither whence they come nor whither 
they go; nor do I inquire too closely into them. It is dangerous to look too 
minutely into such phenomena. It is apt to create a substance where at first 
there was a mere shadow. . . . If at any time there should seem to be an 
expression unintelligible from one soul to another, it is best not to strive to 
interpret it in earthly language, but wait for the soul to make itself 
understood; and, were we to wait a thousand years, we need deem it no more time 
than we can spare. . . . It is not that I have any love of mystery, but because 
I abhor it, and because I have often felt that words may be a thick and 
darksome veil of mystery between the soul and the truth which it seeks. 
Wretched were we, indeed, if we had no better means of communicating ourselves, 
no fairer garb in which to array our essential being, than these poor rags and 
tatters of Babel. Yet words are not without their use even for purposes of 
explanation,--but merely for explaining outward acts and all sorts of external 
things, leaving the soul's life and action to explain itself in its own way.</p>
<p>What a misty disquisition I have scribbled! I would not read it over for 
sixpence.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><em>May</em> 29<em>th.</em>--Rejoice with me, for I am free from a load of 
coal which has been pressing upon my&nbsp;shoulders throughout all the hot 
weather. I am convinced that Christian's burden consisted of coal; and no 
wonder he felt so much relieved, when it fell off and rolled into the 
sepulchre. His load, however, at the utmost, could not have been more than a 
few bushels, whereas mine was exactly one hundred and thirty-five chaldrons and 
seven tubs.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><em>May</em> 30<em>th.</em>--. . . On board my salt-vessels and colliers 
there are many things happening, many pictures which, in future years, when I 
am again busy at the loom of fiction, I could weave in; but my fancy is 
rendered so torpid by my ungenial way of life that I cannot sketch off the 
scenes and portraits that interest me, and I am forced to trust them to my 
memory, with the hope of recalling them at some more favorable period. For 
these three or four days I have been observing a little Mediterranean boy from 
Malaga, not more than ten or eleven years old, but who is already a citizen of 
the world, and seems to be just as gay and contented on the deck of a Yankee 
coal-vessel as he could be while playing beside his mother's door. It is really 
touching to see how free and happy he is,--how the little fellow takes the 
whole wide world for his home, and all mankind for his family. He talks 
Spanish,--at least that is his native tongue; but he is also very intelligible 
in English, and perhaps he likewise has smatterings of the speech of other 
countries, whither the winds may have wafted this little sea-bird. He is a 
Catholic; and yesterday being Friday he caught some fish and fried them for his 
dinner in sweet-oil, and really they looked so delicate that I almost wished he 
would invite me to partake. Every once in a while he undresses himself and leaps
&nbsp;over-board, plunging down beneath the waves as if the sea were as native 
to him as the earth. Then he runs up the rigging of the vessel as if he meant 
to fly away through the air. I must remember this little boy, and perhaps I may 
make something more beautiful of him than these rough and imperfect touches 
would promise.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><em>June</em> 11<em>th.</em>--. . . I could wish that the east-wind would 
blow every day from ten o'clock till five; for there is great refreshment in it 
to us poor mortals that toil beneath the sun. We must not think too unkindly 
even of the east-wind. It is not, perhaps, a wind to be loved, even in its 
benignest moods; but there are seasons when I delight to feel its breath upon 
my cheek, though it be never advisable to throw open my bosom and take it into 
my heart, as I would its gentle sisters of the south and west. To-day, if I had 
been on the wharves, the slight chill of an east-wind would have been a 
blessing, like the chill of death to a world-weary man.</p> 
<p>. . . But this has been one of the idlest days that I ever spent in Boston, 
. . . In the morning, soon after breakfast, I went to the Athen&aelig;um 
gallery, and, during the hour or two that I stayed, not a single visitor came 
in. Some people were putting up paintings in one division of the room; but I 
had the other all to myself. There are two pictures there by our friend Sarah 
Clarke,--scenes in Kentucky.</p> 
<p>From the picture-gallery I went to the reading-rooms of the Athen&aelig;um, 
and there read the magazines till nearly twelve; thence to the Custom House, 
and soon afterwards to dinner with Colonel Hall; then back to the Custom House, 
but only for a little while. There was nothing in the world to do, and so at
&nbsp;two o'clock I came home and lay down, with the &quot;Faerie Queene&quot; 
in my hand.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><em>August</em> 2l<em>st.</em>--Last night I slept like a child of five 
years old, and had no dreams at all,--unless just before it was time to rise, 
and I have forgotten what those dreams were. After I was fairly awake this 
morning, I felt very bright and airy, and was glad that I had been compelled to 
snatch two additional hours of existence from annihilation. The sun's disk was 
but half above the ocean's verge when I ascended the ship's side. These early 
morning hours are very lightsome and quiet. Almost the whole day I have been in 
the shade, reclining on a pile of sails, so that the life and spirit are not 
entirely worn out of me. . . . The wind has been east this afternoon,--perhaps 
in the forenoon, too,--and I could not help feeling refreshed, when the gentle 
chill of its breath stole over my cheek. I would fain abominate the east-wind, 
. . . but it persists in doing me kindly offices now and then. What a perverse 
wind it is! Its refreshment is but another mode of torment.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><em>Salem, Oct.</em> 4<em>th. Union Street [Family Mansion].</em>--. . . 
Here I sit in my old accustomed chamber, where I used to sit in days gone by. . 
. . Here I have written many tales,--many that have been burned to ashes, many 
that doubtless deserved the same fate. This claims to be called a haunted 
chamber, for thousands upon thousands of visions have appeared to me in it; and 
some few of them have become visible to the world. If ever I should have a 
biographer, he ought to make great mention of this chamber in my memoirs, 
because so much of my lonely&nbsp;youth was wasted here, and here my mind and 
character were formed; and here I have been glad and hopeful, and here I have 
been despondent. And here I sat a long, long time, waiting patiently for the 
world to know me, and sometimes wondering why it did not know me sooner, or 
whether it would ever know me at all,--at least, till I were in my grave. And 
sometimes it seemed as if I were already in the grave, with only life enough to 
be chilled and benumbed. But oftener I was happy,--at least, as happy as I then 
knew how to be, or was aware of the possibility of being. By and by, the world 
found me out in my lonely chamber, and called me forth,--not, indeed, with a 
loud roar of acclamation, but rather with a still, small voice,--and forth I 
went, but found nothing in the world that I thought preferable to my old 
solitude till now, . . . And now I begin to understand why I was imprisoned so 
many years in this lonely chamber, and why I could never break through the 
viewless bolts and bars; for if I had sooner made my escape into the world, I 
should have grown hard and rough, and been covered with earthly dust, and my 
heart might have become callous by rude encounters with the multitude. . . . 
But living in solitude till the fulness of time was come, I still kept the dew 
of my youth and the freshness of my heart. . . . I used to think I could 
imagine all passions, all feelings, and states of the heart and mind; but how 
little did I know! . . . Indeed, we are but shadows; we are not endowed with 
real life, and all that seems most real about us is but the thinnest substance 
of a dream,--till the heart be touched. That touch creates us,--then we begin 
to be,--thereby we are beings of reality and inheritors of eternity. . . .&nbsp;
</p> 
<p>When we shall be endowed with our spiritual bodies, I think that they will 
be so constituted that we may send thoughts and feelings any distance in no 
time at all, and transfuse them warm and fresh into the consciousness of those 
whom we love, . . . But, after all, perhaps it is not wise to intermix 
fantastic ideas with the reality of affection. Let us content ourselves to be 
earthly creatures, and hold communion of spirit in such modes as are ordained 
to us. . . .</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>I was not at the end of Long Wharf to-day, but in a distant region,--my 
authority having been put in requisition to quell a rebellion of the captain 
and &quot;gang&quot; of shovelers aboard a coal-vessel. I would you could have 
beheld the awful sternness of my visage and demeanor in the execution of this 
momentous duty. Well,--I have conquered the rebels, and proclaimed an amnesty; 
so to-morrow I shall return to that paradise of measurers, the end of Long 
Wharf,--not to my former salt-ship, she being now discharged, but to another, 
which will probably employ me well-nigh a fortnight longer, . . . Salt is white 
and pure,--there is something holy in salt. . . .</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>I have observed that butterflies--very broad-winged and magnificent 
butterflies--frequently come on board of the salt-ship, where I am at work. 
What have these bright strangers to do on Long Wharf, where there are no 
flowers nor any green thing,--nothing but brick storehouses, stone piers, black 
ships, and the bustle of toilsome men, who neither look up to the blue sky, nor 
take note of these wandering gems of the air? I cannot account for them, unless 
they are the lovely fantasies of the mind.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
<p><em>November.</em>--. . . How delightfully long the evenings are now! I do 
not get intolerably tired any longer, and my thoughts sometimes wander back to 
literature, and I have momentary impulses to write stories. But this will not 
be at present. The utmost that I can hope to do will be to portray some of the 
characteristics of the life which I am now living, and of the people with whom 
I am brought into contact, for future use. . . . The days are cold now, the air 
eager and nipping, yet it suits my health amazingly. I feel as if I could run a 
hundred miles at a stretch, and jump over all the houses that happen to be in 
my way. . . .</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>I have never had the good luck to profit much, or indeed any, by attending 
lectures, so that I think the ticket had better be bestowed on somebody who can 
listen to Mr. ---- more worthily. My evenings are very precious to me, and some 
of them are unavoidably thrown away in paying or receiving visits, or in 
writing letters of business, and therefore I prize the rest as if the sands of 
the hour-glass were gold or diamond dust.</p> 
<p>I was invited to dine at Mr. Bancroft's yesterday, with Miss Margaret 
Fuller; but Providence had given me some business to do, for which I was very 
thankful.</p> 
<p>Is not this a beautiful morning? The sun shines into my soul. </p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<h3>[1841]</h3> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><em>April</em> 1841.--. . . I have been busy all day, from early 
breakfast-time till late in the afternoon; and old Father Time has gone onward 
somewhat less heavily than is his wont when I am imprisoned within the walls of 
the Custom House. It has been a&nbsp;brisk, breezy day, an effervescent 
atmosphere, and I have enjoyed it in all its freshness,--breathing air which 
had not been breathed in advance by the hundred thousand pairs of lungs which 
have common and invisible property in the atmosphere of this great city. My 
breath had never belonged to anybody but me. It came fresh from the wilderness 
of ocean, . . . It was exhilarating to see the vessels, how they bounded over 
the waves, while a sheet of foam broke out around them. I found a good deal of 
enjoyment, too, in the busy scene around me; for several vessels were 
disgorging themselves (what an unseemly figure is this, &quot;disgorge,&quot; 
quotha, as if the vessel were sick) on the wharf, and everybody seemed to be 
working with might and main. It pleased me to think that I also had a part to 
act in the material and tangible business of this life, and that a portion of 
all this industry could not have gone on without my presence. Nevertheless, I 
must not pride myself too much on my activity and utilitarianism. I shall, 
doubtless, soon bewail myself at being compelled to earn my bread by taking 
some little share in the toils of mortal men, . . .</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Articulate words are a harsh clamor and dissonance. When man arrives at his 
highest perfection, he will again be dumb! for I suppose he was dumb at the 
Creation, and must go round an entire circle in order to return to that blessed 
state,</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><em>Brook Farm, Oak Hill, April</em> 13<em>th,</em> 1841.--. . . Here I am 
in a polar Paradise! I know not how to interpret this aspect of 
nature,--whether it be of good or evil omen to our enterprise. But I reflect 
that the Plymouth pilgrims arrived in the midst of&nbsp;storm, and stepped 
ashore upon mountain snow-drifts; and, nevertheless, they prospered, and became 
a great people,--and doubtless it will be the same with us. I laud my stars, 
however, that you will not have your first impressions of (perhaps) our future 
home from such a day as this, . . . Through faith, I persist in believing that 
Spring and Summer will come in their due season; but the unregenerated man 
shivers within me, and suggests a doubt whether I may not have wandered within 
the precincts of the Arctic Circle, and chosen my heritage among everlasting 
snows, . . . Provide yourself with a good stock of furs, and, if you can obtain 
the skin of a polar bear, you will find it a very suitable summer dress for 
this region. . . .</p> 
<p>I have not yet taken my first lesson in agriculture, except that I went to 
see our cows foddered, yesterday afternoon. We have eight of our own; and the 
number is now increased by a transcendental heifer belonging to Miss Margaret 
Fuller. She is very fractious, I believe, and apt to kick over the milk-pail. . 
. . I intend to convert myself into a milkmaid this evening, but I pray Heaven 
that Mr. Ripley may be moved to assign me the kindliest cow in the herd, 
otherwise I shall perform my duty with fear and trembling.</p> 
<p>I like my brethren in affliction very well; and, could you see us sitting 
round our table at meal-times, before the great kitchen fire, you would call it 
a cheerful sight. Mrs. B---- is a most comfortable woman to behold. She looks 
as if her ample person were stuffed full of tenderness,--indeed, as if she were 
all one great, kind heart.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>* * *</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><em>April</em> 14<em>th,</em> 10 A.M.--. . . I did not milk the&nbsp;cows 
last night, because Mr. Ripley was afraid to trust them to my hands, or me to 
their horns, I know not which. But this morning I have done wonders. Before 
breakfast, I went out to the barn and began to chop hay for the cattle, and 
with such &quot;righteous vehemence,&quot; as Mr. Ripley says, did I labor, 
that in the space of ten minutes I broke the machine. Then I brought wood and 
replenished the fires; and finally went down to breakfast, and ate up a huge 
mound of buckwheat cakes. After breakfast, Mr. Ripley put a four-pronged 
instrument into my hands, which he gave me to understand was called a 
pitchfork; and he and Mr. Farley being armed with similar weapons, we all three 
commenced a gallant attack upon a heap of manure. This office being concluded, 
and I having purified myself, I sit down to finish this letter. . . .</p> 
<p>Miss Fuller's cow hooks the other cows, and has made herself ruler of the 
herd, and behaves in a very tyrannical manner. . . . I shall make an excellent 
husbandman,--I feel the original Adam reviving within me.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><em>April</em> 16<em>th.</em>--. . . Since I last wrote, there has been an 
addition to our community of four gentlemen in sables, who promise to be among 
our most useful and respectable members. They arrived yesterday about noon. Mr. 
Ripley had proposed to them to join us, no longer ago than that very morning. I 
had some conversation with them in the afternoon, and was glad to hear them 
express much satisfaction with their new abode and all the arrangements. They 
do not appear to be very communicative, however,--or perhaps it may be merely 
an external reserve, like my own, to shield their delicacy. Several of their
&nbsp;prominent characteristics, as well as their black attire, lead me to 
believe that they are members of the clerical profession; but I have not yet 
ascertained from their own lips what has been the nature of their past lives. I 
trust to have much pleasure in their society, and, sooner or later, that we 
shall all of us derive great strength from our intercourse with them. I cannot 
too highly applaud the readiness with which these four gentlemen in black have 
thrown aside all the fopperies and flummeries which have their origin in a 
false state of society. When I last saw them, they looked as heroically 
regardless of the stains and soils incident to our profession as I did when I 
emerged from the gold-mine, . . .</p> 
<p>I have milked a cow!!! . . . The herd has rebelled against the usurpation 
of Miss Fuller's heifer; and, whenever they are turned out of the barn, she is 
compelled to take refuge under our protection. So much did she impede my labors 
by keeping close to me, that I found it necessary to give her two or three 
gentle pats with a shovel; but still she preferred to trust herself to my 
tender mercies, rather than venture among the horns of the herd. She is not an 
amiable cow; but she has a very intelligent face, and seems to be of a 
reflective cast of character. I doubt not that she will soon perceive the 
expediency of being on good terms with the rest of the sisterhood.</p> 
<p>I have not yet been twenty yards from our house and barn; but I begin to 
perceive that this is a beautiful place. The scenery is of a mild and placid 
character, with nothing bold in its aspect; but I think its beauties will grow 
upon us, and make us love it the more, the longer we live here. There is a 
brook, so near the house that we shall be able to hear its ripple&nbsp;in the 
summer evenings, . . . but, for agricultural purposes, it has been made to flow 
in a straight and rectangular fashion, which does it infinite damage as a 
picturesque object. . . .</p> 
<p>It was a moment or two before I could think whom you meant by Mr. Dismal 
View. Why, he is one of the best of the brotherhood, so far as cheerfulness 
goes; for if he do not laugh himself, he makes the rest of us laugh 
continually. He is the quaintest and queerest personage you ever saw,--full of 
dry jokes, the humor of which is so incorporated with the strange 
twistifications of his physiognomy, that his sayings ought to be written down, 
accompanied with illustrations by Cruikshank. Then he keeps quoting innumerable 
scraps of Latin, and makes classical allusions, while we are turning over the 
gold-mine; and the contrast between the nature of his employment and the 
character of his thoughts is irresistibly ludicrous.</p> 
<p>I have written this epistle in the parlor, while Farmer Ripley, and Farmer 
Farley, and Farmer Dismal View were talking about their agricultural concerns. 
So you will not wonder if it is not a classical piece of composition, either in 
point of thought or expression.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>* * *</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Mr. Ripley has bought four black pigs.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><em>April</em> 22<em>d.</em>--. . . What an abominable hand do I scribble! 
but I have been chopping wood, and turning a grindstone all the forenoon; and 
such occupations are likely to disturb the equilibrium of the muscles and 
sinews. It is an endless surprise to me how much work there is to be done in 
the world; but, thank God, I am able to do my share of it,--and my ability&nbsp;
increases daily. What a great, broad-shouldered, elephantine personage I shall 
become by and by!</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>I milked two cows this morning, and would send you some of the milk, only 
that it is mingled with that which was drawn forth by Mr. Dismal View and the 
rest of the brethren.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><em>April</em> 28<em>th.</em>--. . . I was caught by a cold during my visit 
to Boston. It has not affected my whole frame, but took entire possession of my 
head, as being the weakest and most vulnerable part. Never did anybody sneeze 
with such vehemence and frequency; and my poor brain has been in a thick fog; 
or, rather, it seemed as if my head were stuffed with coarse wool. . . . 
Sometimes I wanted to wrench it off, and give it a great kick, like a football.
</p> 
<p>This annoyance has made me endure the bad weather with even less than 
ordinary patience; and my faith was so far exhausted that, when they told me 
yesterday that the sun was setting clear, I would not even turn my eyes towards 
the west. But this morning I am made all over anew, and have no greater remnant 
of my cold than will serve as an excuse for doing no work to-day.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>* * *</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The family has been dismal and dolorous throughout the storm. The night 
before last, William Allen was stung by a wasp on the eyelid; whereupon the 
whole side of his face swelled to an enormous magnitude, so that, at the 
breakfast-table, one half of him looked like a blind giant (the eye being 
closed), and the other half had such a sorrowful and ludicrous aspect that I 
was constrained to laugh out of sheer pity.&nbsp;The same day, a colony of 
wasps was discovered in my chamber, where they had remained throughout the 
winter, and were now just bestirring themselves, doubtless with the intention 
of stinging me from head to foot. . . . A similar discovery was made in Mr. 
Farley's room. In short, we seem to have taken up our abode in a wasps' nest. 
Thus you see a rural life is not one of unbroken quiet and serenity.</p> 
<p>If the middle of the day prove warm and pleasant, I promise myself to take 
a walk, . . . I have taken one walk with Mr. Farley; and I could not have 
believed that there was such seclusion at so short a distance from a great 
city. Many spots seem hardly to have been visited for ages,--not since John 
Eliot preached to the Indians here. If we were to travel a thousand miles, we 
could not escape the world more completely than we can here.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>* * *</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>I read no newspapers, and hardly remember who is President, and feel as if 
I had no more concern with what other people trouble themselves about than if I 
dwelt in another planet.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><em>May</em> 1<em>st.</em>--. . . Every day of my life makes me feel more 
and more how seldom a fact is accurately stated; how, almost invariably, when a 
story has passed through the mind of a third person, it becomes, so far as 
regards the impression that it makes in further repetitions, little better than 
a falsehood, and this, too, though the narrator be the most truth-seeking 
person in existence. How marvellous the tendency is! . . . Is truth a fantasy 
which we are to pursue forever and never grasp?</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>* * *</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
<p>My cold has almost entirely departed. Were it a sunny day, I should 
consider myself quite fit for labors out of doors; but as the ground is so 
damp, and the atmosphere so chill, and the sky so sullen, I intend to keep 
myself on the sick-list this one day longer, more especially as I wish to read 
Carlyle on Heroes.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>There has been but one flower found in this vicinity,--and that was an 
anemone, a poor, pale, shivering little flower, that had crept under a 
stone-wall for shelter. Mr. Farley found it, while taking a walk with me.</p> 
<p>. . . This is May-Day! Alas, what a difference between the ideal and the 
real!</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><em>May</em> 4<em>th.</em>-- . . . My cold no longer troubles me, and all 
the morning I have been at work under the clear, blue sky, on a hill-side. 
Sometimes it almost seemed as if I were at work in the sky itself, though the 
material in which I wrought was the ore from our gold-mine. Nevertheless, there 
is nothing so unseemly and disagreeable in this sort of toil as you could 
think. It defiles the hands, indeed, but not the soul. This gold ore is a pure 
and wholesome substance, else our mother Nature would not devour it so readily, 
and derive so much nourishment from it, and return such a rich abundance of 
good grain and roots in requital of it.</p> 
<p>The farm is growing very beautiful now,--not that we yet see anything of 
the peas and potatoes which we have planted; but the grass blushes green on the 
slopes and hollows. I wrote that word &quot;blush&quot; almost unconsciously; 
so we will let it go as an inspired utterance. When I go forth afield, . . . I 
look beneath the stone-walls, where the verdure is richest, in&nbsp;hopes that 
a little company of violets, or some solitary bud, prophetic of the summer, may 
be there. . . . But not a wild-flower have I yet found: One of the boys 
gathered some yellow cowslips last Sunday; but I am well content not to have 
found them, for they are not precisely what I should like to send to you, 
though they deserve honor and praise, because they come to us when no others 
will. We have our parlor here dressed in evergreen as at Christmas. That 
beautiful little flower-vase . . . stands on Mr. Ripley's study-table, at which 
I am now writing. It contains some daffodils and some willow-blossoms. I 
brought it here rather than keep it in my chamber, because I never sit there, 
and it gives me many pleasant emotions to look round and be surprised--for it 
is often a surprise, though I well know that it is there--by something 
connected with the idea [of a friend] .</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>* * *</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>I do not believe that I should be patient here if I were not engaged in a 
righteous and heaven-blessed way of life. When I was in the Custom House and 
then at Salem I was not half so patient. . . .</p> 
<p>We had some tableaux last evening, the principal characters being sustained 
by Mr. Farley and Miss Ellen Slade. They went off very well. . . .</p> 
<p>I fear it is time for me--sod-compelling as I am--to take the field again.
</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><em>May</em> 11<em>th.</em>--. . . This morning I arose at milking-time in 
good trim for work; and we have been employed partly in an Augean labor of 
clearing out a wood-shed, and partly in carting loads of oak. This afternoon I 
hope to have something to do in the field, for these jobs about the house are 
not at all to my taste.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
<p><em>June</em> 1<em>st.</em>--. . . I have been too busy to write a long 
letter by this opportunity, for I think this present life of mine gives me an 
antipathy to pen and ink, even more than my Custom House experience did. . . . 
In the midst of toil, or after a hard day's work in the gold-mine, my soul 
obstinately refuses to be poured out on paper. That abominable gold-mine! Thank 
God, we anticipate getting rid of its treasures in the course of two or three 
days! Of all hateful places that is the worst, and I shall never comfort myself 
for having spent so many days of blessed sunshine there. It is my opinion that 
a man's soul may be buried and perish under a dung-heap, or in a furrow of the 
field, just as well as under a pile of money.</p> 
<p>Mr. George Bradford will probably be here to-day, so that there will be no 
danger of my being under the necessity of laboring more than I like hereafter. 
Meantime my health is perfect, and my spirits buoyant, even in the gold-mine.
</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><em>August</em> 12<em>th.</em>--. . . I am very well, and not at all weary, 
for yesterday's rain gave us a holiday; and, moreover, the labors of the farm 
are not so pressing as they have been. And, joyful thought! in a little more 
than a fortnight I shall be free from my bondage,--. . . free to enjoy 
Nature,--free to think and feel! . . . Even my Custom House experience was not 
such a thraldom and weariness; my mind and heart were free. Oh, labor is the 
curse of the world, and nobody can meddle with it without becoming 
proportionably brutified! Is it a praiseworthy matter that I have spent five 
golden months in providing food for cows and horses? It is not so.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
<p><em>August</em> 18<em>th.</em>--I am very well, only somewhat tired with 
walking half a dozen miles immediately after breakfast, and raking hay ever 
since. We shall quite finish haying this week, and then there will be no more 
very hard or constant labor during the one other week that I shall remain a 
slave.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><em>August</em> 22<em>d.</em>--. . . I had an indispensable engagement in 
the bean-field, whither, indeed, I was glad to betake myself, in order to 
escape a parting scene with ----. He was quite out of his wits the night 
before, and I sat up with him till long past midnight. The farm is pleasanter 
now that he is gone; for his unappeasable wretchedness threw a gloom over 
everything. Since I last wrote, we have done haying, and the remainder of my 
bondage will probably be light. It will be a long time, however, before I shall 
know how to make a good use of leisure, either as regards enjoyment or literary 
occupation. . . .</p> 
<p>It is extremely doubtful whether Mr. Ripley will succeed in locating his 
community on this farm. He can bring Mr. E---- to no terms, and the more they 
talk about the matter, the further they appear to be from a settlement. We must 
form other plans for ourselves; for I can see few or no signs that Providence 
purposes to give us a home here. I am weary, weary, thrice weary, of waiting so 
many ages. Whatever may be my gifts, I have not hitherto shown a single one 
that may avail to gather gold. I confess that I have strong hopes of good from 
this arrangement with M----; but when I look at the scanty avails of my past 
literary efforts, I do not feel authorized to expect much from the future. 
Well, we shall see. Other persons have bought large estates and built&nbsp;
splendid mansions with such little books as I mean to write; so that perhaps it 
is not unreasonable to hope that mine may enable me to build a little cottage, 
or, at least, to buy or hire one. But I am becoming more and more convinced 
that we must not lean upon this community. Whatever is to be done must be done 
by my own undivided strength. I shall not remain here through the winter, 
unless with an absolute certainty that there will be a house ready for us in 
the spring. Otherwise, I shall return to Boston,--still, however, considering 
myself an associate of the community, so that we may take advantage of any more 
favorable aspect of affairs. How much depends on these little books! Methinks 
if anything could draw out my whole strength, it would be the motives that now 
press upon me. Yet, after all, I must keep these considerations out of my mind, 
because an external pressure always disturbs instead of assisting me.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Salem, <em>September</em> 3<em>d.</em>--. . . But really I should judge it 
to be twenty years since I left Brook Farm; and I take this to be one proof 
that my life there was an unnatural and unsuitable, and therefore an unreal, 
one. It already looks like a dream behind me. The real Me was never an 
associate of the community; there has been a spectral Appearance there, 
sounding the horn at daybreak, and milking the cows, and hoeing potatoes, and 
raking hay, toiling in the sun, and doing me the honor to assume my name. But 
this spectre was not myself. Nevertheless, it is somewhat remarkable that my 
hands have, during the past summer, grown very brown and rough, insomuch that 
many people persist in believing that I, after all, was the aforesaid spectral 
horn-sounder, cow-milker,&nbsp;potato-hoer, and hay-raker. But such people do 
not know a reality from a shadow. Enough of nonsense. I know not exactly how 
soon I shall return to the farm. Perhaps not sooner than a fortnight from 
to-morrow.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Salem, <em>September</em> 14<em>th.</em>--. . . Master Cheever is a very 
good subject for a sketch, especially if he be portrayed in the very act of 
executing judgment on an evil-doer. The little urchin may be laid across his 
knee, and his arms and legs, and whole person indeed, should be flying all 
abroad, in an agony of nervous excitement and corporeal smart. The Master, on 
the other hand, must be calm, rigid, without anger or pity, the very 
personification of that immitigable law whereby suffering follows sin. Meantime 
the lion's head should have a sort of sly twist on one side of its mouth, and a 
wink of one eye, in order to give the impression that, after all, the crime and 
the punishment are neither of them the most serious things in the world. I 
could draw the sketch myself, if I had but the use of ----'s magic fingers.</p> 
<p>Then the Acadians will do very well for the second sketch. They might be 
represented as just landing on the wharf; or as presenting themselves before 
Governor Shirley, seated in the great chair. Another subject might be old 
Cotton Mather, venerable in a three-cornered hat and other antique attire, 
walking the streets of Boston, and lifting up his hands to bless the people, 
while they all revile him. An old dame should be seen, flinging water, or 
emptying some vials of medicine, on his head from the latticed window of an 
old-fashioned house; and all around must be tokens of pestilence and 
mourning,--as a coffin borne along,--a woman or children weeping on a doorstep. 
Can the tolling of the Old South bell be painted?&nbsp;</p> 
<p>If not this, then the military council, holden at Boston by the Earl of 
Loudon and other captains and governors, might be taken,--his lordship in the 
great chair, an old-fashioned, military figure, with a star on his breast. Some 
of Louis XV.'s commanders will give the costume. On the table, and scattered 
about the room, must be symbols of warfare,--swords, pistols, plumed hats, a 
drum, trumpet, and rolled-up banner in one heap. It were not amiss to introduce 
the armed figure of an Indian chief, as taking part in the council,--or 
standing apart from the English, erect and stern.</p> 
<p>Now for Liberty Tree. There is an engraving of that famous vegetable in 
Snow's History of Boston. If represented, I see not what scene can be beneath 
it, save poor Mr. Oliver, taking the oath. He must have on a bag-wig, ruffled 
sleeves, embroidered coat, and all such ornaments, because he is the 
representative of aristocracy and an artificial system. The people may be as 
rough and wild as the fancy can make them; nevertheless, there must be one or 
two grave, puritanical figures in the midst. Such an one might sit in the great 
chair, and be an emblem of that stern, considerate spirit which brought about 
the Revolution. But this would be a hard subject.</p> 
<p>But what a dolt am I to obtrude my counsel, . . .</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><em>September</em> 16<em>th.</em>--. . . . I do not very well recollect 
Monsieur du Miroir, but, as to Mrs. Bullfrog, I give her up to the severest 
reprehension. The story was written as a mere experiment in that style; it did 
not come from any depth within me,--neither my heart nor mind had anything to 
do with it. I recollect that the Man of Adamant seemed a fine idea to&nbsp;me 
when I looked at it prophetically; but I failed in giving shape and substance 
to the vision which I saw. I don't think it can be very good. . . .</p> 
<p>I cannot believe all these stories about ----, because such a rascal never 
could be sustained and countenanced by respectable men. I take him to be 
neither better nor worse than the average of his tribe. However, I intend to 
have all my copyrights taken out in my own name; and, if he cheat me once, I 
will have nothing more to do with him, but will straightway be cheated by some 
other publisher,--that being, of course, the only alternative.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>* * *</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Governor Shirley's young French wife might be the subject of one of the 
cuts. She should sit in the great chair,--perhaps with a dressing-glass before 
her,--and arrayed in all manner of fantastic finery, and with anoutr&eacute; 
French air, while the old Governor is leaning fondly over her, and a puritanic 
councillor or two are manifesting their disgust in the background. A negro 
footman and a French waiting-maid might be in attendance.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>* * *</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>In Liberty Tree might be a vignette, representing the chair in a very 
shattered, battered, and forlorn condition, after it had been ejected from 
Hutchinson's house. This would serve to impress the reader with the woful 
vicissitudes of sublunary things. . . .</p> 
<p>Did you ever behold such a vile scribble as I write since I became a 
farmer? My chirography always was abominable, but now it is outrageous.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><em>Brook Farm, September</em> 22<em>d,</em> 1841.-- . . . Here I am again, 
slowly adapting myself to the life of this&nbsp;queer community, whence I seem 
to have been absent half a lifetime,--so utterly have I grown apart from the 
spirit and manners of the place. . . . I was most kindly received; and the 
fields and woods looked very pleasant in the bright sunshine of the day before 
yesterday. I have a friendlier disposition towards the farm, now that I am no 
longer obliged to toil in its stubborn furrows. Yesterday and to-day, however, 
the weather has been intolerable,--cold, chill, sullen, so that it is 
impossible to be on kindly terms with Mother Nature. . . .</p> 
<p>I doubt whether I shall succeed in writing another volume of Grandfather's 
Library while I remain here. I have not the sense of perfect seclusion which 
has always been essential to my power of producing anything. It is true, nobody 
intrudes into my room; but still I cannot be quiet. Nothing here is settled; 
everything is but beginning to arrange itself, and though I would seem to have 
little to do with aught beside my own thoughts, still I cannot but partake of 
the ferment around me. My mind will not be abstracted. I must observe, and 
think, and feel, and content myself with catching glimpses of things which may 
be wrought out hereafter. Perhaps it will be quite as well that I find myself 
unable to set seriously about literary occupation for the present. It will be 
good to have a longer interval between my labor of the body and that of the 
mind. I shall work to the better purpose after the beginning of November. 
Meantime I shall see these people and their enterprise under a new point of 
view, and perhaps be able to determine whether we have any call to cast in our 
lot among them.</p>

<p>I do wish the weather would put off this sulky mood. Had it not been for 
the warmth and brightness of Monday, when I arrived here, I should have 
supposed that all sunshine had left Brook Farm forever. I have no disposition 
to take long walks in such a state of the sky; nor have I any buoyancy of 
spirit. I am a very dull person just at this time.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><em>September</em> 25<em>th.</em>--. . . One thing is certain. I cannot and 
will not spend the winter here. The time would be absolutely thrown away so far 
as regards any literary labor to be performed. . . .</p> 
<p>The intrusion of an outward necessity into labors of the imagination and 
intellect is, to me, very painful. . . .</p> 
<p>I had rather a pleasant walk to a distant meadow a day or two ago, and we 
found white and purple grapes in great abundance, ripe, and gushing with rich, 
pure juice when the hand pressed the clusters. Did you know what treasures of 
wild grapes there are in this land? If we dwell here, we will make our own 
wine, . . .</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><em>September</em> 27<em>th.</em>--. . . Now, as to the affair with ----, I 
fully confide in your opinion that he intends to make an unequal bargain with 
poor, simple, innocent me,--never having doubted this myself. But how is he to 
accomplish it? I am not, nor shall be, the least in his power, whereas he is, 
to a certain extent, in mine. He might announce his projected Library, with me 
for the editor, in all the newspapers in the universe; but still I could not be 
bound to become the editor, unless by my own act; nor should I have the 
slightest scruple in refusing to be so, at the last&nbsp;moment, if he 
persisted in treating me with injustice. Then, as for his printing 
&quot;Grandfather's Chair,&quot; I have the copyright in my own hands, and 
could and would prevent the sale, or make him account to me for the profits, in 
case of need. Meantime he is making arrangements for publishing the Library, 
contracting with other booksellers, and with printers and engravers, and, with 
every step, making it more difficult for himself to draw back. I, on the other 
hand, do nothing which I should not do if the affair with--were at an end; for, 
if I write a book, it will be just as available for some other publisher as for 
him. Instead of getting me into his power by this delay, he has trusted to my 
ignorance and simplicity, and has put<em>himself</em> in <em>my</em> power.</p> 
<p>He is not insensible of this. At our last interview, he himself introduced 
the subject of the bargain, and appeared desirous to close it. But I was not 
prepared,--among other reasons, because I do not yet see what materials I shall 
have for the republications in the Library; the works that he has shown me 
being ill adapted for that purpose; and I wish first to see some French and 
German books which he has sent for to New York. And, before concluding the 
bargain, I have promised George Hillard to consult him, and let him do the 
business. Is not this consummate discretion? and am I not perfectly safe? . . . 
I look at the matter with perfect composure, and see all round my own position, 
and know that it is impregnable.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>* * *</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>I was elected to two high offices last night,--viz. to be a trustee of the 
Brook Farm estate, and Chairman of the Committee of Finance! . . . From the 
nature of my office, I shall have the chief direction&nbsp;of all the money 
affairs of the community, the making of bargains, the supervision of receipts 
and expenditures, etc., etc., etc. . . .</p> 
<p>My accession to these august offices does not at all decide the question of 
my remaining here permanently. I told Mr. Ripley that I could not spend the 
winter at the farm, and that it was quite uncertain whether I returned in the 
spring, . . .</p> 
<p>Take no part, I beseech you, in these magnetic miracles. I am unwilling 
that a power should be exercised on you of which we know neither the origin nor 
consequence, and the phenomena of which seem rather calculated to bewilder us 
than to teach us any truths about the present or future state of being. . . . 
Supposing that the power arises from the transfusion of one spirit into 
another, it seems to me that the sacredness of an individual is violated by it; 
there would be an intruder into the holy of holies, . . . I have no faith 
whatever that people are raised to the seventh heaven, or to any heaven at all, 
or that they gain any insight into the mysteries of life beyond death, by means 
of this strange science. Without distrusting that the phenomena have really 
occurred, I think that they are to be accounted for as the result of a material 
and physical, not of a spiritual, influence. Opium has produced many a brighter 
vision of heaven, I fancy, and just as susceptible of proof, as these. They are 
dreams. . . . And what delusion can be more lamentable and mischievous, than to 
mistake the physical and material for the spiritual? What so miserable as to 
lose the soul's true, though hidden, knowledge and consciousness of heaven in 
the mist of an earth-born vision? If we would know what heaven is before we 
come thither, let us retire into the depths of&nbsp;our own spirits, and we 
shall find it there among holy thoughts and feelings; but let us not degrade 
high heaven and its inhabitants into any such symbols and forms as Miss L---- 
describes; do not let an earthly effluence from Mrs. P----'s corporeal system 
bewilder and perhaps contaminate, something spiritual and sacred. I should as 
soon think of seeking revelations of the future state in the rottenness of the 
grave,--where so many do seek it, . . .</p> 
<p>The view which I take of this matter is caused by no want of faith in 
mysteries; but from a deep reverence of the soul, and of the mysteries which it 
knows within itself, but never transmits to the earthly eye and ear. Keep the 
imagination sane,--that is one of the truest conditions of communion with 
heaven.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><em>Brook Farm, September</em> 26<em>th.</em>--A walk this morning along 
the Needham road. A clear, breezy morning, after nearly a week of cloudy and 
showery weather. The grass is much more fresh and vivid than it was last month, 
and trees still retain much of their verdure, though here and there is a shrub 
or a bough arrayed in scarlet and gold. Along the road, in the midst of a 
beaten track, I saw mushrooms or toad-stools which had sprung up probably 
during the night.</p> 
<p>The houses in this vicinity are, many of them, quite antique, with long, 
sloping roofs, commencing at a few feet from the ground, and ending in a lofty 
peak. Some of them have huge old elms overshadowing the yard. One may see the 
family sleigh near the door, it having stood there all through the summer 
sunshine, and perhaps with weeds sprouting through the crevices of its bottom, 
the growth of the months since snow departed. Old barns, patched and supported
&nbsp;by timbers leaning against the sides, and stained with the excrement of 
past ages.</p> 
<p>In the forenoon I walked along the edge of the meadow towards Cow Island. 
Large trees, almost a wood, principally of pine with the green pasture-glades 
intermixed, and cattle feeding. They cease grazing when an intruder appears, 
and look at him with long and wary observation, then bend their heads to the 
pasture again. Where the firm ground of the pasture ceases, the meadow 
begins,--loose, spongy, yielding to the tread, sometimes permitting the foot to 
sink into black mud, or perhaps over ankles in water. Cattle-paths, somewhat 
firmer than the general surface, traverse the dense shrubbery which has 
overgrown the meadow. This shrubbery consists of small birch, elders, maples, 
and other trees, with here and there white-pines of larger growth. The whole is 
tangled and wild and thick-set, so that it is necessary to part the nestling 
stems and branches, and go crashing through. There are creeping plants of 
various sorts which clamber up the trees; and some of them have changed color 
in the slight frosts which already have befallen these low grounds, so that one 
sees a spiral wreath of scarlet leaves twining up to the top of a green tree, 
intermingling its bright hues with their verdure, as if all were of one piece. 
Sometimes, instead of scarlet, the spiral wreath is of a golden yellow.</p> 
<p>Within the verge of the meadow, mostly near the firm shore of pasture 
ground, I found several grapevines, hung with an abundance of large purple 
grapes. The vines had caught hold of maples and alders, and climbed to the 
summit, curling round about and interwreathing their twisted folds in so 
intimate a&nbsp;manner that it was not easy to tell the parasite from the 
supporting tree or shrub. Sometimes the same vine had enveloped several shrubs, 
and caused a strange, tangled confusion, converting all these poor plants to 
the purpose of its own support, and hindering their growing to their own 
benefit and convenience. The broad vine-leaves, some of them yellow or 
yellowish-tinged, were seen apparently growing on the same stems with the 
silver-mapled leaves, and those of the other shrubs, thus married against their 
will by the conjugal twine; and the purple clusters of grapes hung down from 
above and in the midst, so that one might &quot;gather grapes,&quot; if not 
&quot;of thorns,&quot; yet of as alien bushes.</p> 
<p>One vine had ascended almost to the tip of a large white-pine, spreading 
its leaves and hanging its purple clusters among all its boughs,--still 
climbing and clambering, as if it would not be content till it had crowned the 
very summit with a wreath of its own foliage and bunches of grapes. I mounted 
high into the tree, and ate the fruit there, while the vine wreathed still 
higher into the depths above my head. The grapes were sour, being not yet fully 
ripe. Some of them, however, were sweet and pleasant.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><em>September</em> 27<em>th.</em>--A ride to Brighton yesterday morning, it 
being the day of the weekly cattle-fair. William Allen and myself went in a 
wagon, carrying a calf to be sold at the fair. The calf had not had his 
breakfast, as his mother had preceded him to Brighton, and he kept expressing 
his hunger and discomfort by loud, sonorous baas, especially when we passed any 
cattle in the fields or in the road. The cows, grazing within hearing, 
expressed great interest,&nbsp;and some of them came galloping to the roadside 
to behold the calf. Little children, also, on their way to school, stopped to 
laugh and point at poor little Bossie. He was a prettily behaved urchin, and 
kept thrusting his hairy muzzle between William and myself, apparently wishing 
to be stroked and patted. It was an ugly thought that his confidence in human 
nature, and nature in general, was to be so ill rewarded as by cutting his 
throat, and selling him in quarters. This, I suppose, has been his fate before 
now!</p> 
<p>It was a beautiful morning, clear as crystal, with an invigorating, but not 
disagreeable coolness. The general aspect of the country was as green as 
summer,--greener indeed than mid or latter summer, and there were occasional 
interminglings of the brilliant hues of autumn, which made the scenery more 
beautiful, both visibly and in sentiment. We saw no absolutely mean nor 
poor-looking abodes along the road. There were warm and comfortable 
farm-houses, ancient, with the porch, the sloping roof, the antique peak, the 
clustered chimney, of old times; and modern cottages, smart and tasteful; and 
villas, with terraces before them, and dense shade, and wooden urns on pillars, 
and other such tokens of gentility. Pleasant groves of oak and walnut, also, 
there were, sometimes stretching along valleys, sometimes ascending a hill and 
clothing it all round, so as to make it a great clump of verdure. Frequently we 
passed people with cows, oxen, sheep, or pigs for Brighton Fair.</p> 
<p>On arriving at Brighton, we found the village thronged with people, horses, 
and vehicles. Probably there is no place in New England where the character of 
an agricultural population may be so well studied.&nbsp;Almost all the farmers 
within a reasonable distance make it a point, I suppose, to attend Brighton 
Fair pretty frequently, if not on business, yet as amateurs. Then there are all 
the cattle-people and butchers who supply the Boston market, and dealers from 
far and near; and every man who has a cow or a yoke of oxen, whether to sell or 
buy, goes to Brighton on Monday. There were a thousand or two of cattle in the 
extensive pens belonging to the tavern-keeper, besides many that were standing 
about. One could hardly stir a step without running upon the horns of one 
dilemma or another, in the shape of ox, cow, bull, or ram. The yeomen appeared 
to be more in their element than I have ever seen them anywhere else, except, 
indeed, at labor,--more so than at musterings and such gatherings of amusement. 
And yet this was a sort of festal day, as well as a day of business. Most of 
the people were of a bulky make, with much bone and muscle, and some good store 
of fat, as if they had lived on flesh-diet; with mottled faces, too, hard and 
red, like those of persons who adhered to the old fashion of spirit-drinking. 
Great, round-paunched country squires were there too, sitting under the porch 
of the tavern, or waddling about, whip in hand, discussing the points of the 
cattle. There were also gentlemen-farmers, neatly, trimly, and fashionably 
dressed, in handsome surtouts, and trousers strapped under their boots. Yeomen, 
too, in their black or blue Sunday suits, cut by country tailors, and awkwardly 
worn. Others (like myself) had on the blue stuff frocks which they wear in the 
fields, the most comfortable garments that ever were invented. Country loafers 
were among the throng,--men who looked wistfully at the liquors in the bar, and 
waited for some friend to invite them to drink,--&nbsp;poor, shabby, 
out-at-elbowed devils. Also, dandies from the city, corseted and buckramed, who 
had come to see the humors of Brighton Fair. All these, and other varieties of 
mankind, either thronged the spacious bar-room of the hotel, drinking, smoking, 
talking, bargaining, or walked about among the cattle-pens, looking with 
knowing eyes at the horned people. The owners of the cattle stood near at hand, 
waiting for offers. There was something indescribable in their aspect, that 
showed them to be the owners, though they mixed among the crowd. The cattle, 
brought from a hundred separate farms, or rather a thousand, seemed to agree 
very well together, not quarrelling in the least. They almost all had a 
history, no doubt, if they could but have told it. The cows had each given her 
milk to support families,--had roamed the pastures, and come home to the 
barn-yard, had been looked upon as a sort of member of the domestic circle, and 
was known by a name, as Brindle or Cherry. The oxen, with their necks bent by 
the heavy yoke, had toiled in the plough-field and in haying-time for many 
years, and knew their master's stall as well as the master himself knew his own 
table. Even the young steers and the little calves had something of domestic 
sacredness about them; for children had watched their growth, and petted them, 
and played with them. And here they all were, old and young, gathered from 
their thousand homes to Brighton Fair; whence the great chance was that they 
would go to the slaughter-house, and thence be transmitted, in surloins, 
joints, and such pieces, to the tables of the Boston folk.</p> 
<p>William Allen had come to buy four little pigs to take the places of four 
who have now grown large at our farm, and are to be fatted and killed within a 
few&nbsp;weeks. There were several hundreds, in pens appropriated to their use, 
grunting discordantly, and apparently in no very good humor with their 
companions or the world at large. Most or many of these pigs had been imported 
from the State of New York. The drovers set out with a large number, and peddle 
them along the road till they arrive at Brighton with the remainder. William 
selected four, and bought them at five cents per pound. These poor little 
porkers were forthwith seized by the tails, their legs tied, and they thrown 
into our wagon, where they kept up a continual grunt and squeal till we got 
home. Two of them were yellowish, or light gold-color, the other two were black 
and white speckled; and all four of very piggish aspect and deportment. One of 
them snapped at William's finger most spitefully and bit it to the bone.</p> 
<p>All the scene of the Fair was very characteristic and peculiar,--cheerful 
and lively, too, in the bright, warm sun. I must see it again; for it ought to 
be studied.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><em>September</em> 28<em>th.</em>--A picnic party in the woods, yesterday, 
in honor of little Frank Dana's birthday, he being six years old. I strolled 
out, after dinner, with Mr. Bradford, and in a lonesome glade we met the 
apparition of an Indian chief, dressed in appropriate costume of blanket, 
feathers, and paint, and armed with a musket. Almost at the same time, a young 
gypsy fortune-teller came from among the trees, and proposed to tell my 
fortune. While she was doing this, the goddess Diana let fly an arrow, and hit 
me smartly in the hand. The fortune-teller and goddess were in fine contrast, 
Diana being a blonde, fair, quiet,&nbsp;with a moderate composure; and the 
gypsy (O. G.) a bright, vivacious, dark-haired, rich-complexioned damsel,--both 
of them very pretty, at least pretty enough to make fifteen years enchanting. 
Accompanied by these denizens of the wild wood, we went onward, and came to a 
company of fantastic figures, arranged in a ring for a dance or a game. There 
was a Swiss girl, an Indian squaw, a negro of the Jim Crow order, one or two 
foresters, and several people in Christian attire, besides children of all 
ages. Then followed childish games, in which the grown people took part with 
mirth enough,--while I, whose nature it is to be a mere spectator both of sport 
and serious business, lay under the trees and looked on. Meanwhile, Mr. Emerson 
and Miss Fuller, who arrived an hour or two before, came forth into the little 
glade where we were assembled. Here followed much talk. The ceremonies of the 
day concluded with a cold collation of cakes and fruit. All was pleasant 
enough,--an excellent piece of work,--&quot;would't were done!&quot; It has 
left a fantastic impression on my memory, this intermingling of wild and 
fabulous characters with real and homely ones, in the secluded nook of the 
woods. I remember them, with the sunlight breaking through overshadowing 
branches, and they appearing and disappearing confusedly,--perhaps starting out 
of the earth; as if the every-day laws of nature were suspended for this 
particular occasion. There were the children, too, laughing and sporting about, 
as if they were at home among such strange shapes,--and anon bursting into loud 
uproar of lamentation, when the rude gambols of the merry archers chanced to 
overturn them. And apart, with a shrewd, Yankee observation of the scene, 
stands our friend Orange, a thick-set, sturdy figure, enjoying the fun well 
enough, yet, rather laughing with a perception of its nonsensicalness than at 
all entering into the spirit of the thing.</p> 
<p>This morning I have been helping to gather apples. The principal farm 
labors at this time are ploughing for winter rye, and breaking up the 
greensward for next year's crop of potatoes, gathering squashes, and not much 
else, except such year-round employments as milking. The crop of rye, to be 
sure, is in process of being threshed, at odd intervals.</p> 
<p>I ought to have mentioned among the diverse and incongruous growths of the 
picnic party our two Spanish boys from Manilla,--Lucas, with his heavy features 
and almost mulatto complexion; and Jos&eacute;, slighter, with rather a 
feminine face,--not a gay, girlish one, but grave, reserved, eying you 
sometimes with an earnest but secret expression, and causing you to question 
what sort of person he is.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><em>Friday, October</em> l<em>st.</em>--I have been looking at our four 
swine,--not of the last lot, but those in process of fattening. They lie among 
the clean rye straw in the sty, nestling close together; for they seem to be 
beasts sensitive to the cold, and this is a clear, bright, crystal morning, 
with a cool northwest-wind. So there lie these four black swine, as deep among 
the straw as they can burrow, the very symbols of slothful ease and sensuous 
comfort. They seem to be actually oppressed and overburdened with comfort. They 
are quick to notice any one's approach, and utter a low grunt thereupon,--not 
drawing a breath for that particular purpose, but grunting with their ordinary 
breath,--at the same time turning an observant, though dull and sluggish eye 
upon the visitor. They seem to be involved and buried in their own corporeal 
substance, and to look dimly forth at the outer world. They breathe not easily, 
and yet not with difficulty nor discomfort; for the very unreadiness and 
oppression with which their breath comes appears to make them sensible of the 
deep sensual satisfaction which they feel. Swill, the remnant of their last 
meal, remains in the trough, denoting that their food is more abundant than 
even a hog can demand. Anon they fall asleep, drawing short and heavy breaths, 
which heave their huge sides up and down; but at the slightest noise they 
sluggishly unclose their eyes, and give another gentle grunt. They also grunt 
among themselves, without any external cause; but merely to express their 
swinish sympathy. I suppose it is the knowledge that these four grunters are 
doomed to die within two or three weeks that gives them a sort of awfulness in 
my conception. It makes me contrast their present gross substance of fleshly 
life with the nothingness speedily to come. Meantime the four newly bought pigs 
are running about the cow-yard, lean, active, shrewd, investigating everything, 
as their nature is. When I throw an apple among them, they scramble with one 
another for the prize, and the successful one scampers away to eat it at 
leisure. They thrust their snouts into the mud, and pick a grain of corn out of 
the rubbish. Nothing within their sphere do they leave unexamined, grunting all 
the time with infinite variety of expression. Their language is the most 
copious of that of any quadruped, and, indeed, there is something deeply and 
indefinably interesting in the swinish race. They appear the more a mystery the 
longer one gazes at them. It seems as if there were an important meaning to 
them, if one could but find it out. One&nbsp;interesting trait in them is their 
perfect independence of character. They care not for man, and will not adapt 
themselves to his notions, as other beasts do; but are true to themselves, and 
act out their hoggish nature.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><em>October</em> 7<em>th.</em>--Since Saturday last (it being now 
Thursday), I have been in Boston and Salem, and there has been a violent storm 
and rain during the whole time. This morning shone as bright as if it meant to 
make up for all the dismalness of the past days. Our brook, which in the summer 
was no longer a running stream, but stood in pools along its pebbly course, is 
now full from one grassy verge to the other, and hurries along with a murmuring 
rush. It will continue to swell, I suppose, and in the winter and spring it 
will flood all the broad meadows through which it flows.</p> 
<p>I have taken a long walk this forenoon along the Needham road, and across 
the bridge, thence pursuing a cross-road through the woods, parallel with the 
river, which I crossed again at Dedham. Most of the road lay through a growth 
of young oaks principally. They still retain their verdure, though, looking 
closely in among them, one perceives the broken sunshine falling on a few sere 
or bright-hued tufts of shrubbery. In low, marshy spots, on the verge of the 
meadows or along the river-side, there is a much more marked autumnal change. 
Whole ranges of bushes are there painted with many variegated hues, not of the 
brightest tint, but of a sober cheerfulness. I suppose this is owing more to 
the late rains than to the frost; for a heavy rain changes the foliage somewhat 
at this season. The first marked frost was seen last Saturday morning. Soon 
after sunrise it lay, white as snow,&nbsp;over all the grass, and on the tops 
of the fences, and in the yard, on the heap of firewood. On Sunday, I think, 
there was a fall of snow, which, however, did not lie on the ground a moment.
</p> 
<p>There is no season when such pleasant and sunny spots may be lighted on, 
and produce so pleasant an effect on the feelings, as now in October. The 
sunshine is peculiarly genial; and in sheltered places, as on the side of a 
bank, or of a barn or house, one becomes acquainted and friendly with the 
sunshine. It seems to be of a kindly and homely nature. And the green grass, 
strewn with a few withered leaves, looks the more green and beautiful for them. 
In summer or spring, Nature is farther from one's sympathies.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><em>October</em> 8<em>th.</em>--Another gloomy day, lowering with portents 
of rain close at hand. I have walked up into the pastures this morning, and 
looked about me a little. The woods present a very diversified appearance just 
now, with perhaps more varieties of tint than they are destined to wear at a 
somewhat later period. There are some strong yellow hues, and some deep red; 
there are innumerable shades of green, some few having the depth of summer; 
others, partially changed towards yellow, look freshly verdant with the 
delicate tinge of early summer or of May. Then there is the solemn and dark 
green of the pines. The effect is, that every tree in the wood and every bush 
among the shrubbery has a separate existence, since, confusedly intermingled, 
each wears its peculiar color, instead of being lost in the universal emerald 
of summer. And yet there is a oneness of effect likewise, when we choose to 
look at a whole sweep of woodland instead of analyzing its component trees. 
Scattered over the&nbsp;pasture, which the late rains have kept tolerably 
green, there are spots or islands of dusky red,--a deep, substantial hue, very 
well fit to be close to the ground,--while the yellow, and light, fantastic 
shades of green soar upward to the sky. These red spots are the blueberry and 
whortleberry bushes. The sweet-fern is changed mostly to russet, but still 
retains its wild and delightful fragrance when pressed in the hand. Wild China 
asters are scattered about, but beginning to wither. A little while ago, 
mushrooms or toadstools were very numerous along the wood-paths and by the 
roadsides, especially after rain. Some were of spotless white, some yellow, and 
some scarlet. They are always mysteries and objects of interest to me, 
springing as they do so suddenly from no root or seed, and growing one wonders 
why. I think, too, that some varieties are pretty objects, little fairy tables, 
centre-tables, standing on one leg. But their growth appears to be checked now, 
and they are of a brown tint and decayed.</p> 
<p>The farm business to-day is to dig potatoes. I worked a little at it. The 
process is to grasp all the stems of a hill and pull them up. A great many of 
the potatoes are thus pulled, clinging to the stems and to one another in 
curious shapes,--long red things, and little round ones, imbedded in the earth 
which clings to the roots. These being plucked off, the rest of the potatoes 
are dug out of the hill with a hoe, the tops being flung into a heap for the 
cow-yard. On my way home, I paused to inspect the squash-field. Some of the 
squashes lay in heaps as they were gathered, presenting much variety of shape 
and hue,--as golden yellow, like great lumps of gold, dark green, striped and 
variegated; and some were round, and&nbsp;some lay curling their long necks, 
nestling, as it were, and seeming as if they had life.</p> 
<p>In my walk yesterday forenoon I passed an old house which seemed to be 
quite deserted. It was a two-story, wooden house, dark and weather-beaten. The 
front windows, some of them, were shattered and open, and others were boarded 
up. Trees and shrubbery were growing neglected, so as quite to block up the 
lower part. There was an aged barn near at hand, so ruinous that it had been 
necessary to prop it up. There were two old carts, both of which had lost a 
wheel. Everything was in keeping. At first I supposed that there would be no 
inhabitants in such a dilapidated place; but, passing on, I looked back, and 
saw a decrepit and infirm old man at the angle of the house, its fit occupant. 
The grass, however, was very green and beautiful around this dwelling, and, the 
sunshine falling brightly on it, the whole effect was cheerful and pleasant. It 
seemed as if the world was so glad that this desolate old place, where there 
was never to be any more hope and happiness, could not at all lessen the 
general effect of joy.</p> 
<p>I found a small turtle by the roadside, where he had crept to warm himself 
in the genial sunshine. He had a sable back, and underneath his shell was 
yellow, and at the edges bright scarlet. His head, tail, and claws were striped 
yellow, black, and red. He withdrew himself as far as he possibly could into 
his shell, and absolutely refused to peep out, even when I put him into the 
water. Finally, I threw him into a deep pool and left him. These mailed 
gentlemen, from the size of a foot or more down to an inch, were very numerous 
in the spring; and now the smaller kind appear again.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
<p><em>Saturday, October</em> 9<em>th.</em>--Still dismal weather. Our 
household, being composed in great measure of children and young people, is 
generally a cheerful one enough, even in gloomy weather. For a week past we 
have been especially gladdened with a little seamstress from Boston, about 
seventeen years old; but of such apetite figure, that, at first view, one would 
take her to be hardly in her teens. She is very vivacious and smart, laughing 
and singing and talking all the time,--talking sensibly; but still, taking the 
view of matters that a city girl naturally would. If she were larger than she 
is, and of less pleasing aspect, I think she might be intolerable; but being so 
small, and with a fair skin, and as healthy as a wild-flower, she is really 
very agreeable; and to look at her face is like being shone upon by a ray of 
the sun. She never walks, but bounds and dances along, and this motion, in her 
diminutive person, does not give the idea of violence. It is like a bird, 
hopping from twig to twig, and chirping merrily all the time. Sometimes she is 
rather vulgar, but even that works well enough into her character, and accords 
with it. On continued observation, one discovers that she is not a little girl, 
but really a little woman, with all the prerogatives and liabilities of a 
woman. This gives a new aspect to her, while the girlish impression still 
remains, and is strangely combined with the sense that this frolicsome maiden 
has the material for the sober bearing of a wife. She romps with the boys, runs 
races with them in the yard, and up and down the stairs, and is heard scolding 
laughingly at their rough play. She asks William Allen to place her &quot;on 
top of that horse,&quot; whereupon he puts his large brown hands about her 
waist, and, swinging her to and fro, lifts her on&nbsp;horseback. William 
threatens to rivet two horseshoes round her neck, for having clambered, with 
the other girls and boys, upon a load of hay, whereby the said load lost its 
balance and slid off the cart. She strings the seed-berries of roses together, 
making a scarlet necklace of them, which she fastens about her throat. She 
gathers flowers of everlasting to wear in her bonnet, arranging them with the 
skill of a dressmaker. In the evening, she sits singing by the hour, with the 
musical part of the establishment, often breaking into laughter, whereto she is 
incited by the tricks of the boys. The last thing one hears of her, she is 
tripping up stairs to bed, talking lightsomely or warbling; and one meets her 
in the morning, the very image of bright morn itself, smiling briskly at you, 
so that one takes her for a promise of cheerfulness through the day. Be it 
said, with all the rest, that there is a perfect maiden modesty in her 
deportment. She has just gone away, and the last I saw of her was her vivacious 
face peeping through the curtain of the cariole, and nodding a gay farewell to 
the family, who were shouting their adieus at the door. With her other merits, 
she is an excellent daughter, and supports her mother by the labor of her 
hands. It would be difficult to conceive beforehand how much can be added to 
the enjoyment of a household by mere sunniness of temper and liveliness of 
disposition; for her intellect is very ordinary, and she never says anything 
worth hearing, or even laughing at, in itself. But she herself is an expression 
well worth studying.</p>

<p><em>Brook Farm, October</em> 9<em>th.</em>--A walk this afternoon to Cow 
Island. The clouds had broken away towards noon, and let forth a few sunbeams, 
and more and&nbsp;more blue sky ventured to appear, till at last it was really 
warm and sunny,--indeed, rather too warm in the sheltered hollows, though it is 
delightful to be too warm now, after so much stormy chillness. Oh the beauty of 
grassy slopes, and the hollow ways of paths winding between hills, and the 
intervals between the road and wood-lots, where Summer lingers and sits down, 
strewing dandelions of gold, and blue asters, as her parting gifts and 
memorials! I went to a grapevine, which I have already visited several times, 
and found some clusters of grapes still remaining, and now perfectly ripe. 
Coming within view of the river, I saw several wild ducks under the shadow of 
the opposite shore, which was high, and covered with a grove of pines. I should 
not have discovered the ducks had they not risen and skimmed the surface of the 
glassy stream, breaking its dark water with a bright streak, and, sweeping 
round, gradually rose high enough to fly away. I likewise started a partridge 
just within the verge of the woods, and in another place a large squirrel ran 
across the wood-path from one shelter of trees to the other. Small birds, in 
flocks, were flitting about the fields, seeking and finding I know not what 
sort of food. There were little fish, also, darting in shoals through the pools 
and depths of the brooks, which are now replenished to their brims, and rush 
towards the river with a swift, amber-colored current.</p> 
<p>Cow Island is not an island,--at least, at this season,--though, I believe, 
in the time of freshets, the marshy Charles floods the meadows all round about 
it, and extends across its communication with the mainland. The path to it is a 
very secluded one, threading a wood of pines, and just wide enough to admit the 
loads of meadow hay which are drawn from the&nbsp;splashy shore of the river. 
The island has a growth of stately pines, with tall and ponderous stems, 
standing at distance enough to admit the eye to travel far among them; and, as 
there is no underbrush, the effect is somewhat like looking among the pillars 
of a church.</p> 
<p>I returned home by the high-road. On my right, separated from the road by a 
level field, perhaps fifty yards across, was a range of young forest-trees, 
dressed in their garb of autumnal glory. The sun shone directly upon them; and 
sunlight is like the breath of life to the pomp of autumn. In its absence, one 
doubts whether there be any truth in what poets have told about the splendor of 
an American autumn; but when this charm is added, one feels that the effect is 
beyond description. As I beheld it to-day, there was nothing dazzling; it was 
gentle and mild, though brilliant and diversified, and had a most quiet and 
pensive influence. And yet there were some trees that seemed really made of 
sunshine, and others were of a sunny red, and the whole picture was painted 
with but little relief of darksome hues,--only a few evergreens. But there was 
nothing inharmonious; and, on closer examination, it appeared that all the 
tints had a relationship among themselves. And this, I suppose, is the reason 
that, while nature seems to scatter them so carelessly, they still never shock 
the beholder by their contrasts, nor disturb, but only soothe. The brilliant 
scarlet and the brilliant yellow are different hues of the maple-leaves, and 
the first changes into the last. I saw one maple-tree, its centre yellow as 
gold, set in a framework of red. The native poplars have different shades of 
green, verging towards yellow, and are very cheerful in the sunshine. Most&nbsp;
of the oak-leaves have still the deep verdure of summer; but where a change has 
taken place, it is into a russet-red, warm, but sober. These colors, infinitely 
varied by the progress which different trees have made in their decay, 
constitute almost the whole glory of autumnal woods; but it is impossible to 
conceive how much is done with such scanty materials. In my whole walk I saw 
only one man, and he was at a distance, in the obscurity of the trees. He had a 
horse and a wagon, and was getting a load of dry brushwood.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><em>Sunday, October</em> 10<em>th.</em>--I visited my grapevine this 
afternoon, and ate the last of its clusters. This vine climbs around a young 
maple-tree, which has now assumed the yellow leaf. The leaves of the vine are 
more decayed than those of the maple. Thence to Cow Island, a solemn and 
thoughtful walk. Returned by another path, of the width of a wagon, passing 
through a grove of hard wood, the lightsome hues of which make the walk more 
cheerful than among the pines. The roots of oaks emerged from the soil, and 
contorted themselves across the path. The sunlight, also, broke across in 
spots, and otherwheres the shadow was deep; but still there was intermingling 
enough of bright hues to keep off the gloom from the whole path.</p> 
<p>Brooks and pools have a peculiar aspect at this season. One knows that the 
water must be cold, and one shivers a little at the sight of it; and yet the 
grass about the pool may be of the deepest green, and the sun may be shining 
into it. The withered leaves which overhanging trees shed upon its surface 
contribute much to the effect.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Insects have mostly vanished in the fields and woods. I hear locusts yet, 
singing in the sunny hours, and crickets have not yet finished their song. Once 
in a while I see a caterpillar,--this afternoon, for instance, a red, hairy 
one, with black head and tail. They do not appear to be active, and it makes 
one rather melancholy to look at them.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><em>Tuesday, October</em> 12<em>th.</em>--The cawing of the crow resounds 
among the woods. A sentinel is aware of your approach a great way off, and 
gives the alarm to his comrades loudly and eagerly,--Caw, caw, caw! Immediately 
the whole conclave replies, and you behold them rising above the trees, 
flapping darkly, and winging their way to deeper solitudes. Sometimes, however, 
they remain till you come near enough to discern their sable gravity of aspect, 
each occupying a separate bough, or perhaps the blasted tip-top of a pine. As 
you approach, one after another, with loud cawing, flaps his wings and throws 
himself upon the air.</p> 
<p>There is hardly a more striking feature in the landscape nowadays than the 
red patches of blueberry and whortleberry bushes, as seen on a sloping 
hill-side, like islands among the grass, with trees growing in them; or 
crowning the summit of a bare, brown hill with their somewhat russet 
liveliness; or circling round the base of an earth-imbedded rock. At a 
distance, this hue, clothing spots and patches of the earth, looks more like a 
picture than anything else,--yet such a picture as I never saw painted.</p> 
<p>The oaks are now beginning to look sere, and their leaves have withered 
borders. It is pleasant to notice the wide circle of greener grass beneath the
&nbsp;circumference of an overshadowing oak. Passing an orchard, one hears an 
uneasy rustling in the trees, and not as if they were struggling with the wind. 
Scattered about are barrels to contain the gathered apples; and perhaps a great 
heap of golden or scarlet apples is collected in one place.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><em>Wednesday, October</em> 13<em>th.</em>--A good view, from an upland 
swell of our pasture, across the valley of the river Charles. There is the 
meadow, as level as a floor, and carpeted with green, perhaps two miles from 
the rising ground on this side of the river to that on the opposite side. The 
stream winds through the midst of the flat space, without any banks at all; for 
it fills its bed almost to the brim, and bathes the meadow grass on either 
side. A tuft of shrubbery, at broken intervals, is scattered along its border; 
and thus it meanders sluggishly along, without other life than what it gains 
from gleaming in the sun. Now, into the broad, smooth meadow, as into a lake, 
capes and headlands put themselves forth, and shores of firm woodland border 
it, covered with variegated foliage, making the contrast so much the stronger 
of their height and rough outline with the even spread of the plain. And 
beyond, and far away, rises a long, gradual swell of country, covered with an 
apparently dense growth of foliage for miles, till the horizon terminates it; 
and here and there is a house, or perhaps two, among the contiguity of trees. 
Everywhere the trees wear their autumnal dress, so that the whole landscape is 
red, russet, orange, and yellow, blending in the distance into a rich tint of 
brown-orange, or nearly that,--except the green expanse so definitely hemmed in 
by the higher ground.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>I took a long walk this morning, going first nearly to Newton, thence 
nearly to Brighton, thence to Jamaica Plain, and thence home. It was a fine 
morning, with a northwest-wind; cool when facing the wind, but warm and most 
genially pleasant in sheltered spots; and warm enough everywhere while I was in 
motion. I traversed most of the by-ways which offered themselves to me; and, 
passing through one in which there was a double line of grass between the 
wheel-tracks and that of the horses' feet, I came to where had once stood a 
farmhouse, which appeared to have been recently torn down. Most of the old 
timber and boards had been carted away; a pile of it, however, remained. The 
cellar of the house was uncovered, and beside it stood the base and middle 
height of the chimney. The oven, in which household bread had been baked for 
daily food, and puddings and cake and jolly pumpkin-pies for festivals, opened 
its mouth, being deprived of its iron door. The fireplace was close at hand. 
All round the site of the house was a pleasant, sunny, green space, with old 
fruit-trees in pretty fair condition, though aged. There was a barn, also aged, 
but in decent repair; and a ruinous shed, on the corner of which was nailed a 
boy's windmill, where it had probably been turning and clattering for years 
together, till now it was black with time and weather-stain. It was broken, but 
still it went round whenever the wind stirred. The spot was entirely secluded, 
there being no other house within a mile or two.</p> 
<p>No language can give an idea of the beauty and glory of the trees, just at 
this moment. It would be easy, by a process of word-daubing, to set down a 
confused group of gorgeous colors, like a bunch of&nbsp;tangled skeins of 
bright silk; but there is nothing of the reality in the glare which would thus 
be produced. And yet the splendor both of individual clusters and of whole 
scenes is unsurpassable. The oaks are now far advanced in their change of hue; 
and, in certain positions relatively to the sun, they light up and gleam with a 
most magnificent deep gold, varying according as portions of the foliage are in 
shadow or sunlight. On the sides which receive the direct rays, the effect is 
altogether rich; and in other points of view it is equally beautiful, if less 
brilliant. This color of the oak is more superb than the lighter yellow of the 
maples and walnuts. The whole landscape is now covered with this indescribable 
pomp; it is discerned on the uplands afar off; and Blue Hill in Milton, at the 
distance of several miles, actually glistens with rich, dark light,--no, not 
glistens, nor gleams,--but perhaps to say glows subduedly will be a truer 
expression for it.</p> 
<p>Met few people this morning; a grown girl, in company with a little boy, 
gathering barberries in a secluded lane; a portly, autumnal gentleman, wrapped 
in a great-coat, who asked the way to Mr. Joseph Goddard's; and a fish-cart 
from the city, the driver of which sounded his horn along the lonesome way.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><em>Monday, October</em> 18<em>th</em>--There has been a succession of days 
which were cold and bright in the forenoon, and gray, sullen, and chill towards 
night. The woods have now taken a soberer tint than they wore at my last date. 
Many of the shrubs which looked brightest a little while ago are now wholly 
bare of leaves. The oaks have generally a russet-brown shade, although some of 
them are still green, as are likewise&nbsp;other scattered trees in the 
forests. The bright yellow and the rich scarlet are no more to be seen. 
Scarcely any of them will now bear a close examination; for this shows them to 
be rugged, wilted, and of faded, frost-bitten hue; but at a distance, and in 
the mass, and enlivened by the sun, they have still somewhat of the varied 
splendor which distinguished them a week ago. It is wonderful what a difference 
the sunshine makes; it is like varnish, bringing out the hidden veins in a 
piece of rich wood. In the cold, gray atmosphere, such as that of most of our 
afternoons now, the landscape lies dark,--brown, and in a much deeper shadow 
than if it were clothed in green. But, perchance, a gleam of sun falls on a 
certain spot of distant shrubbery or woodland, and we see it brighten with many 
hues, standing forth prominently from the dimness around it. The sunlight 
gradually spreads, and the whole sombre scene is changed to a motley 
picture,--the sun bringing out many shades of color, and converting its gloom 
to an almost laughing cheerfulness. At such times I almost doubt whether the 
foliage has lost any of its brilliancy. But the clouds intercept the sun again, 
and lo! old Autumn appears, clad in his cloak of russet-brown.</p> 
<p>Beautiful now, while the general landscape lies in shadow, looks the summit 
of a distant hill (say a mile off), with the sunshine brightening the trees 
that cover it. It is noticeable that the outlines of hills, and the whole bulk 
of them at the distance of several miles, become stronger, denser, and more 
substantial in this autumn atmosphere and in these autumnal tints than in 
summer. Then they looked blue, misty, and dim. Now they show their great 
humpbacks more plainly, as if they had drawn nearer to us.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>A waste of shrubbery and small trees, such as overruns the borders of the 
meadows for miles together, looks much more rugged, wild, and savage in its 
present brown color than when clad in green.</p> 
<p>I passed through a very pleasant wood-path yesterday, quite shut in and 
sheltered by trees that had not thrown off their yellow robes. The sun shone 
strongly in among them, and quite kindled them; so that the path was brighter 
for their shade than if it had been quite exposed to the sun.</p> 
<p>In the village graveyard, which lies contiguous to the street, I saw a man 
digging a grave, and one inhabitant after another turned aside from his way to 
look into the grave and talk with the digger. I heard him laugh, with the 
traditionary mirthfulness of men of that occupation.</p> 
<p>In the hollow of the woods, yesterday afternoon, I lay a long while 
watching a squirrel, who was capering about among the trees over my head (oaks 
and white-pines, so close together that their branches intermingled). The 
squirrel seemed not to approve of my presence, for he frequently uttered a 
sharp, quick, angry noise, like that of a scissors-grinder's wheel. Sometimes I 
could see him sitting on an impending bough, with his tail over his back, 
looking down pryingly upon me. It seems to be a natural posture with him, to 
sit on his hind legs, holding up his fore paws. Anon, with a peculiarly quick 
start, he would scramble along the branch, and be lost to sight in another part 
of the tree, whence his shrill chatter would again be heard. Then I would see 
him rapidly descending the trunk, and running along the ground; and a moment 
afterwards, casting my eye upward, I beheld him flitting like a bird among the 
high limbs at the&nbsp;summit, directly above me. Afterwards, he apparently 
became accustomed to my society, and set about some business of his own. He 
came down to the ground, took up a piece of a decayed bough (a heavy burden for 
such a small personage), and, with this in his mouth, again climbed up and 
passed from the branches of one tree to those of another, and thus onward and 
onward till he went out of sight. Shortly afterwards he returned for another 
burden, and this he repeated several times. I suppose he was building a 
nest,--at least, I know not what else could have been his object. Never was 
there such an active, cheerful, choleric, continually-in-motion fellow as this 
little red squirrel, talking to himself, chattering at me, and as sociable in 
his own person as if he had half a dozen companions, instead of being alone in 
the lonesome wood. Indeed, he flitted about so quickly, and showed himself in 
different places so suddenly, that I was in some doubt whether there were not 
two or three of them.</p> 
<p>I must mention again the very beautiful effect produced by the masses of 
berry-bushes, lying like scarlet islands in the midst of withered 
pasture-ground, or crowning the tops of barren hills. Their hue, at a distance, 
is lustrous scarlet, although it does not look nearly as bright and gorgeous 
when examined close at hand. But at a proper distance it is a beautiful fringe 
on Autumn's petticoat.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><em>Friday, October</em> 22<em>d.</em>--A continued succession of 
unpleasant, Novembery days, and autumn has made rapid progress in the work of 
decay. It is now somewhat of a rare good fortune to find a verdant, grassy 
spot, on some slope, or in a dell; and even such seldom-seen oases are bestrewn 
with dried brown leaves,&nbsp;--which, however, methinks, make the short, fresh 
grass look greener around them. Dry leaves are now plentiful everywhere, save 
where there are none but pine-trees. They rustle beneath the tread, and there 
is nothing more autumnal than that sound. Nevertheless, in a walk this 
afternoon, I have seen two oaks which retained almost the greenness of summer. 
They grew close to the huge Pulpit Rock, so that portions of their trunks 
appeared to grasp the rough surface; and they were rooted beneath it, and, 
ascending high into the air, overshadowed the gray crag with verdure. Other 
oaks, here and there, have a few green leaves or boughs among their rustling 
and rugged shade.</p> 
<p>Yet, dreary as the woods are in a bleak, sullen day, there is a very 
peculiar sense of warmth and a sort of richness of effect in the slope of a 
bank and in sheltered spots, where bright sunshine falls, and the brown oaken 
foliage is gladdened by it. There is then a feeling of comfort, and 
consequently of heart-warmth, which cannot be experienced in summer.</p> 
<p>I walked this afternoon along a pleasant wood-path, gently winding, so that 
but little of it could be seen at a time, and going up and down small mounds, 
now plunging into a denser shadow, and now emerging from it. Part of the way it 
was strewn with the dusky, yellow leaves of white-pines,--the cast-off garments 
of last year; part of the way with green grass, close-cropped, and very fresh 
for the season. Sometimes the trees met across it; sometimes it was bordered on 
one side by an old rail-fence of moss-grown cedar, with bushes sprouting 
beneath it, and thrusting their branches through it; sometimes by a stone-wall 
of unknown antiquity, older than the wood it closed in. A&nbsp;stone-wall, when 
shrubbery has grown around it, and thrust its roots beneath it, becomes a very 
pleasant and meditative object. It does not belong too evidently to man, having 
been built so long ago. It seems a part of nature.</p> 
<p>Yesterday I found two mushrooms in the woods, probably of the preceding 
night's growth. Also I saw a mosquito, frost-pinched, and so wretched that I 
felt avenged for all the injuries which his tribe inflicted upon me last 
summer, and so did not molest this lone survivor.</p> 
<p>Walnuts in their green rinds are falling from the trees, and so are 
chestnut-burrs.</p> 
<p>I found a maple-leaf to-day, yellow all over, except its extremest point, 
which was bright scarlet. It looked as if a drop of blood were hanging from it. 
The first change of the maple-leaf is to scarlet; the next, to yellow. Then it 
withers, wilts, and drops off, as most of them have already done.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Service of plate, presented by the city of London to Sir William Pepperell, 
together with a table of solid silver. The table very narrow, but long; the 
articles of plate numerous, but of small dimensions,--the tureen not holding 
more than three pints. At the close of the Revolution, when the Pepperell and 
Sparhawk property was confiscated, this plate was sent to the grandson of Sir 
William, in London. It was so valuable, that Sheriff Moulton, of old York, with 
six well-armed men, accompanied it to Boston. Pepperell's only daughter married 
Colonel Sparhawk, a fine gentleman of the day. Andrew Pepperell, the son, was 
rejected by a young lady (afterwards the mother of Mrs. General Knox), to whom 
he was on the point of marriage, as being addicted to low company and low 
pleasures. The lover, two days afterwards, in the streets of Portsmouth, was 
sun-struck, and fell down dead. Sir William had built an elegant house for his 
son and his intended wife; but after the death of the former he never entered 
it. He lost his cheerfulness and social qualities, and gave up intercourse with 
people, except on business. Very anxious to secure his property to his 
descendants by the provisions of his will, which was drawn up by Judge Sewall, 
then a young lawyer. Yet the Judge lived to see two of Sir William's 
grandchildren so reduced that they were to have been numbered among the town's 
poor, and were only rescued from this fate by private charity.</p> 
<p>The arms and crest of the Pepperell family were displayed over the door of 
every room in Sir William's house. In Colonel Sparhawk's house there were forty 
portraits, most of them in full length. The house built for Sir William's son 
was occupied as barracks&nbsp;during the Revolution, and much injured. A few 
years after the peace, it was blown down by a violent tempest, and finally no 
vestige of it was left, but there remained only a summer-house and the family 
tomb.</p> 
<p>At Sir William's death, his mansion was hung with black, while the body lay 
in state for a week. All the Sparhawk portraits were covered with black crape, 
and the family pew was draped with black. Two oxen were roasted, and liquid 
hospitality dispensed in proportion.</p>

<p>Old lady's dress seventy or eighty years ago. Brown brocade gown, with a 
nice lawn handkerchief and apron,--short sleeves, with a little ruffle, just 
below the elbow,--black mittens,--a lawn cap, with rich lace border,--a black 
velvet hood on the back of the head, tied with black ribbon under the chin. She 
sat in an old-fashioned easy-chair, in a small, low parlor,--the wainscot 
painted entirely black, and the walls hung with a dark velvet paper.</p> 
<p>A table, stationary ever since the house was built, extending the whole 
length of a room. One end was raised two steps higher than the rest. The Lady 
Ursula, an early Colonial heroine, was wont to dine at the upper end, while her 
servants sat below. This was in the kitchen. An old garden and summer-house, 
and roses, currant-bushes, and tulips, which Lady Ursula had brought from 
Grondale Abbey, in Old England. Although a hundred and fifty years before, and 
though their roots were propagated all over the country, they were still 
flourishing in the original garden. This Lady Ursula was the daughter of Lord 
Thomas Cutts, of Grondale Abbey, in England. She had been in love with an 
officer named Fowler, who&nbsp;was supposed to have been slain in battle. After 
the death of her father and mother, Lady Ursula came to Kittery, bringing 
twenty men-servants and several women. After a time, a letter arrived from her 
lover, who was not killed, but merely a prisoner to the French. He announced 
his purpose to come to America, where he would arrive in October. A few days 
after the letter came, she went out in a low carriage to visit her work-people, 
and was blessing the food for their luncheon, when she fell dead, struck by an 
Indian tomahawk, as did all the rest save one. They were buried where the 
massacre took place, and a stone was erected, which (possibly) still remains. 
The lady's family had a grant from Sir Ferdinando Gorges of the territory 
thereabout, and her brother had likewise come over and settled in the vicinity. 
I believe very little of this story. Long afterwards, at about the commencement 
of the Revolution, a descendant of Fowler came from England, and applied to the 
Judge of Probate to search the records for a will, supposed to have been made 
by Lady Ursula in favor of her lover as soon as she heard of his existence. In 
the mean time the estate had been sold to Colonel Whipple. No will could be 
found. (Lady Ursula was old Mrs. Cutts, widow of President Cutts.)</p> 
<p>The mode of living of Lady Ursula's brother in Kittery. A drawbridge to the 
house, which was raised every evening, and lowered in the morning, for the 
laborers and the family to pass out. They kept thirty cows, a hundred sheep, 
and several horses. The house spacious,--one room large enough to contain forty 
or fifty guests. Two silver branches for candles,--the walls ornamented with 
paintings and needlework. The floors were daily rubbed with wax, and shone&nbsp;
like a mahogany table. A domestic chaplain, who said prayers every morning and 
evening in a small apartment called the chapel. Also a steward and butler. The 
family attended the Episcopal Church at Christmas, Easter, and Good Friday, and 
gave a grand entertainment once a year.</p> 
<p>Madam Cutts, at the last of these entertainments, wore a black damask gown, 
and cuffs with double lace ruffles, velvet shoes, blue silk stockings, white 
and silver stomacher. The daughter and granddaughters in rich brocades and 
yellow satin. Old Major Cutts in brown velvet, laced with gold, and a large 
wig. The parson in his silk cassock, and his helpmate in brown damask. Old 
General Atkinson in scarlet velvet, and his wife and daughters in white damask. 
The Governor in black velvet, and his lady in crimson tabby trimmed with 
silver, The ladies wore bell-hoops, high-heeled shoes, paste buckles, silk 
stockings, and enormously high head-dresses, with lappets of Brussels lace 
hanging thence to the waist.</p> 
<p>Among the eatables, a silver tub of the capacity of four gallons, holding a 
pyramid of pancakes powdered with white sugar.</p> 
<p>The date assigned to all this about 1690.</p>

<p><em>June</em> 1<em>st,</em> 1842.--One of my chief amusements is to see the 
boys sail their miniature vessels on the Frog Pond. There is a great variety of 
shipping owned among the young people, and they appear to have a considerable 
knowledge of the art of managing vessels. There is a full-rigged man-of-war, 
with, I believe, every spar, rope, and sail, that sometimes makes its 
appearance; and, when on a voyage across the pond, it so identically resembles 
a great ship, except in size, that it has the effect of a picture. All its 
motions,--its tossing up and down on the small waves, and its sinking and 
rising in a calm swell, its heeling to the breeze,--the whole effect, in short, 
is that of a real ship at sea; while, moreover, there is something that kindles 
the imagination more than the reality would do. If we see a real, great ship, 
the mind grasps and possesses, within its real clutch, all that there is of it; 
while here the mimic ship is the representation of an ideal one, and so gives 
us a more imaginative pleasure. There are many schooners that ply to and fro on 
the pond, and pilot-boats, all perfectly rigged. I saw a race, the other day, 
between the ship above mentioned and a pilot-boat, in which the latter came off 
conqueror. The boys appear to be well acquainted with all the ropes and sails, 
and can call them by their&nbsp;nautical names. One of the owners of the 
vessels remains on one side of the pond, and the other on the opposite side, 
and so they send the little bark to and fro, like merchants of different 
countries, consigning their vessels to one another.</p> 
<p>Generally, when any vessel is on the pond, there are full-grown spectators, 
who look on with as much interest as the boys themselves. Towards sunset, this 
is especially the case: for then are seen young girls and their lovers; 
mothers, with their little boys in hand; school-girls, beating hoops round 
about, and occasionally running to the side of the pond; rough tars, or perhaps 
masters or young mates of vessels, who make remarks about the miniature 
shipping, and occasionally give professional advice to the navigators; visitors 
from the country; gloved and caned young gentlemen,--in short, everybody stops 
to take a look. In the mean time, dogs are continually plunging into the pond, 
and swimming about, with noses pointed upward, and snatching at floating chips; 
then emerging, they shake themselves, scattering a horizontal shower on the 
clean gowns of ladies and trousers of gentlemen; then scamper to and fro on the 
grass, with joyous barks.</p> 
<p>Some boys cast off lines of twine with pin-hooks, and perhaps pull out a 
horned-pout,--that being, I think, the only kind of fish that inhabits the Frog 
Pond.</p> 
<p>The ship-of-war above mentioned is about three feet from stem to stern, or 
possibly a few inches more. This, if I mistake not, was the size of a 
ship-of-the-line in the navy of Liliput.</p>

excitement. He had a singing-girl, he drank spirits, smelled penetrating odors,

<p><em>Concord, August</em> 5<em>th.</em>--A rainy day,--a rainy day. I am 
commanded to take pen in hand, and I am therefore banished to the little 
ten-foot-square apartment misnamed my study; but perhaps the dismalness of the 
day and the dulness of my solitude will be the prominent characteristics of 
what I write. And what is there to write about? Happiness has no succession of 
events, because it is a part of eternity; and we have been living in eternity 
ever since we came to this old manse. Like Enoch, we seem to have been 
translated to the other state of being without having passed through death. Our 
spirits must have flitted away unconsciously, and we can only perceive that we 
have cast off our mortal part by the more real and earnest life of our souls. 
Externally, our Paradise has very much the aspect of a pleasant old domicile on 
earth. This antique house--for it looks antique, though it was created by 
Providence&nbsp;expressly for our use, and at the precise time when we wanted 
it--stands behind a noble avenue of balm-of-Gilead trees; and when we chance to 
observe a passing traveller through the sunshine and the shadow of this long 
avenue, his figure appears too dim and remote to disturb the sense of blissful 
seclusion. Few, indeed, are the mortals who venture within our sacred 
precincts. George Prescott, who has not yet grown earthly enough, I suppose, to 
be debarred from occasional visits to Paradise, comes daily to bring three 
pints of milk from some ambrosial cow; occasionally, also, he makes an offering 
of mortal flowers. Mr. Emerson comes sometimes, and has been feasted on our 
nectar and ambrosia. Mr. Thoreau has twice listened to the music of the 
spheres, which, for our private convenience, we have packed into a musical-box. 
E---- H---- , who is much more at home among spirits than among fleshly bodies, 
came hither a few times merely to welcome us to the ethereal world; but 
latterly she has vanished into some other region of infinite space. One rash 
mortal, on the second Sunday after our arrival, obtruded himself upon us in a 
gig. There have since been three or four callers, who preposterously think that 
the courtesies of the lower world are to be responded to by people whose home 
is in Paradise. I must not forget to mention that the butcher conies twice or 
thrice a week; and we have so far improved upon the custom of Adam and Eve, 
that we generally furnish forth our feasts with portions of some delicate calf 
or lamb, whose unspotted innocence entitles them to the happiness of becoming 
our sustenance. Would that I were permitted to record the celestial dainties 
that kind Heaven provided for us on the first day of our&nbsp;arrival! Never, 
surely, was such food heard of on earth,--at least, not by me. Well, the 
above-mentioned persons are nearly all that have entered into the hallowed 
shade of our avenue; except, indeed, a certain sinner who came to bargain for 
the grass in our orchard, and another who came with a new cistern. For it is 
one of the drawbacks upon our Eden that it contains no water fit either to 
drink or to bathe in; so that the showers have become, in good truth, a 
godsend. I wonder why Providence does not cause a clear, cold fountain to 
bubble up at our doorstep; methinks it would not be unreasonable to pray for 
such a favor. At present we are under the ridiculous necessity of sending to 
the outer world for water. Only imagine Adam trudging out of Paradise with a 
bucket in each hand, to get water to drink, or for Eve to bathe in! 
Intolerable! (though our stout handmaiden really fetches our water.) In other 
respects Providence has treated us pretty tolerably well; but here I shall 
expect something further to be done. Also, in the way of future favors, a 
kitten would be very acceptable. Animals (except, perhaps, a pig) seem never 
out of place, even in the most paradisiacal spheres. And, by the way, a young 
colt comes up our avenue, now and then, to crop the seldom-trodden herbage; and 
so does a company of cows, whose sweet breath well repays us for the food which 
they obtain. There are likewise a few hens, whose quiet cluck is heard 
pleasantly about the house. A black dog sometimes stands at the farther 
extremity of the avenue, and looks wistfully hitherward; but when I whistle to 
him, he puts his tail between his legs, and trots away. Foolish dog! if he had 
more faith, he should have bones enough.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
<p><em>Saturday, August</em> 6<em>th.</em>--Still a dull day, threatening 
rain, yet without energy of character enough to rain outright. However, 
yesterday there were showers enough to supply us well with their beneficent 
out-pouring. As to the new cistern, it seems to be bewitched; for, while the 
spout pours into it like a cataract, it still remains almost empty. I wonder 
where Mr. Hosmer got it; perhaps from Tantalus, under the eaves of whose palace 
it must formerly have stood; for, like his drinking-cup in Hades, it has the 
property of filling itself forever, and never being full.</p> 
<p>After breakfast I took my fishing-rod, and went down through our orchard to 
the river-side; but as three or four boys were already in possession of the 
best spots along the shore, I did not fish. This river of ours is the most 
sluggish stream that I ever was acquainted with. I had spent three weeks by its 
side, and swam across it every day, before I could determine which way its 
current ran; and then I was compelled to decide the question by the testimony 
of others, and not by my own observation. Owing to this torpor of the stream, 
it has nowhere a bright, pebbly shore, nor is there so much as a narrow strip 
of glistening sand in any part of its course; but it slumbers along between 
broad meadows, or kisses the tangled grass of mowing-fields and pastures, or 
bathes the overhanging boughs of elder-bushes and other water-loving plants. 
Flags and rushes grow along its shallow margin. The yellow water-lily spreads 
its broad flat leaves upon its surface; and the fragrant white pond-lily occurs 
in many favored spots,--generally selecting a situation just so far from the 
river's brink that it cannot be grasped except at the hazard&nbsp;of plunging 
in. But thanks be to the beautiful flower for growing at any rate. It is a 
marvel whence it derives its loveliness and perfume, sprouting as it does from 
the black mud over which the river sleeps, and from which the yellow lily 
likewise draws its unclean life and noisome odor. So it is with many people in 
this world; the same soil and circumstances may produce the good and beautiful, 
and the wicked and ugly. Some have the faculty of assimilating to themselves 
only what is evil, and so they become as noisome as the yellow water-lily. Some 
assimilate none but good influences, and their emblem is the fragrant and 
spotless pond-lily, whose very breath is a blessing to all the region round 
about. . . . Among the productions of the river's margin, I must not forget the 
pickerel-weed, which grows just on the edge of the water, and shoots up a long 
stalk crowned with a blue spire, from among large green leaves. Both the flower 
and the leaves look well in a vase with pond-lilies, and relieve the unvaried 
whiteness of the latter; and, being all alike children of the waters, they are 
perfectly in keeping with one another. . . .</p> 
<p>I bathe once, and often twice, a day in our river; but one dip into the 
salt sea would be worth more than a whole week's soaking in such a lifeless 
tide. I have read of a river somewhere (whether it be in classic regions or 
among our Western Indians I know not) which seemed to dissolve and steal away 
the vigor of those who bathed in it. Perhaps our stream will be found to have 
this property. Its water, however, is pleasant in its immediate effect, being 
as soft as milk, and always warmer than the air. Its hue has a slight tinge of 
gold, and my limbs, when I behold them through its medium, look tawny. I am not
&nbsp;aware that the inhabitants of Concord resemble their native river in any 
of their moral characteristics. Their forefathers, certainly, seem to have had 
the energy and impetus of a mountain torrent, rather than the torpor of this 
listless stream,--as it was proved by the blood with which they stained their 
river of Peace. It is said there are plenty of fish in it; but my most 
important captures hitherto have been a mud-turtle and an enormous eel. The 
former made his escape to his native element,--the latter we ate; and truly he 
had the taste of the whole river in his flesh, with a very prominent flavor of 
mud. On the whole, Concord River is no great favorite of mine; but I am glad to 
have any river at all so near at hand, it being just at the bottom of our 
orchard. Neither is it without a degree and kind of picturesqueness, both in 
its nearness and in the distance, when a blue gleam from its surface, among the 
green meadows and woods, seems like an open eye in Earth's countenance. 
Pleasant it is, too, to behold a little flat-bottomed skiff gliding over its 
bosom, which yields lazily to the stroke of the paddle, and allows the boat to 
go against its current almost as freely as with it. Pleasant, too, to watch an 
angler, as he strays along the brink, sometimes sheltering himself behind a 
tuft of bushes, and trailing his line along the water, in hopes to catch a 
pickerel. But, taking the river for all in all, I can find nothing more fit to 
compare it with than one of the half-torpid earthworms which I dig up for bait. 
The worm is sluggish, and so is the river,--the river is muddy, and so is the 
worm. You hardly know whether either of them be alive or dead; but still, in 
the course of time, they both manage to creep away. The best aspect of the 
Concord is when there is a&nbsp;northwestern breeze curling its surface, in a 
bright, sunshiny day. It then assumes a vivacity not its own. Moonlight, also, 
gives it beauty, as it does to all scenery of earth or water.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><em>Sunday, August</em> 7<em>th.</em>--At sunset last evening I ascended 
the hill-top opposite our house; and, looking downward at the long extent of 
the river, it struck me that I had done it some injustice in my remarks. 
Perhaps, like other gentle and quiet characters, it will be better appreciated 
the longer I am acquainted with it. Certainly, as I beheld it then, it was one 
of the loveliest features in a scene of great rural beauty. It was visible 
through a course of two or three miles, sweeping in a semicircle round the hill 
on which I stood, and being the central line of a broad vale on either side. At 
a distance, it looked like a strip of sky set into the earth, which it so 
etherealized and idealized that it seemed akin to the upper regions. Nearer the 
base of the hill, I could discern the shadows of every tree and rock, imaged 
with a distinctness that made them even more charming than the reality; 
because, knowing them to be unsubstantial, they assumed the ideality which the 
soul always craves in the contemplation of earthly beauty. All the sky, too, 
and the rich clouds of sunset, were reflected in the peaceful bosom of the 
river; and surely, if its bosom can give back such an adequate reflection of 
heaven, it cannot be so gross and impure as I described it yesterday. Or, if 
so, it shall be a symbol to me that even a human breast, which may appear least 
spiritual in some aspects, may still have the capability of reflecting an 
infinite heaven in its depths, and therefore of enjoying it. It is a 
comfortable thought, that the smallest and&nbsp;most turbid mud-puddle can 
contain its own picture of heaven. Let us remember this, when we feel inclined 
to deny all spiritual life to some people, in whom, nevertheless, our Father 
may perhaps see the image of His face. This dull river has a deep religion of 
its own; so, let us trust, has the dullest human soul, though, perhaps, 
unconsciously.</p> 
<p>The scenery of Concord, as I beheld it from the summit of the hill, has no 
very marked characteristics, but has a great deal of quiet beauty, in keeping 
with the river. There are broad and peaceful meadows, which, I think, are among 
the most satisfying objects in natural scenery. The heart reposes on them with 
a feeling that few things else can give, because almost all other objects are 
abrupt and clearly defined; but a meadow stretches out like a small infinity, 
yet with a secure homeliness which we do not find either in an expanse of water 
or of air. The hills which border these meadows are wide swells of land, or 
long and gradual ridges, some of them densely covered with wood. The white 
village, at a distance on the left, appears to be embosomed among wooded hills. 
The verdure of the country is much more perfect than is usual at this season of 
the year, when the autumnal hue has generally made considerable progress over 
trees and grass. Last evening, after the copious showers of the preceding two 
days, it was worthy of early June, or, indeed, of a world just created. Had I 
not then been alone, I should have had a far deeper sense of beauty, for I 
should have looked through the medium of another spirit. Along the horizon 
there were masses of those deep clouds in which the fancy may see images of all 
things that ever existed or were dreamed of. Over our old manse, of which I 
could&nbsp;catch but a glimpse among its embowering trees, appeared the 
immensely gigantic figure of a hound, crouching down with head erect, as if 
keeping watchful guard while the master of the mansion was away. . . . How 
sweet it was to draw near my own home, after having lived homeless in the world 
so long! . . . With thoughts like these, I descended the hill, and clambered 
over the stone-wall, and crossed the road, and passed up our avenue, while the 
quaint old house put on an aspect of welcome.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><em>Monday, August</em> 8<em>th.</em>--I wish I could give a description of 
our house, for it really has a character of its own, which is more than can be 
said of most edifices in these days. It is two stories high, with a third story 
of attic chambers in the gable-roof. When I first visited it, early in June, it 
looked pretty much as it did during the old clergyman's lifetime, showing all 
the dust and disarray that might be supposed to have gathered about him in the 
course of sixty years of occupancy. The rooms seemed never to have been 
painted; at all events, the walls and panels, as well as the huge cross-beams, 
had a venerable and most dismal tinge of brown. The furniture consisted of 
high-backed, short-legged, rheumatic chairs, small, old tables, bedsteads with 
lofty posts, stately chests of drawers, looking-glasses in antique black 
frames, all of which were probably fashionable in the days of Dr. Ripley's 
predecessor. It required some energy of imagination to conceive the idea of 
transforming this ancient edifice into a comfortable modern residence. However, 
it has been successfully accomplished. The old Doctor's sleeping-apartment, 
which was the front room on the ground-floor, we have converted into a parlor; 
and by&nbsp;the aid of cheerful paint and paper, a gladsome carpet, pictures 
and engravings, new furniture,bijouterie, and a daily supply of flowers, it has 
become one of the prettiest and pleasantest rooms in the whole world. The shade 
of our departed host will never haunt it; for its aspect has been changed as 
completely as the scenery of a theatre. Probably the ghost gave one peep into 
it, uttered a groan, and vanished forever. The opposite room has been 
metamorphosed into a store-room. Through the house, both in the first and 
second story, runs a spacious hall or entry, occupying more space than is 
usually devoted to such a purpose in modern times. This feature contributes to 
give the whole house an airy, roomy, and convenient appearance; we can breathe 
the freer by the aid of the broad passageway. The front door of the hall looks 
up the stately avenue, which I have already mentioned; and the opposite door 
opens into the orchard, through which a path descends to the river. In the 
second story we have at present fitted up three rooms,--one being our own 
chamber, and the opposite one a guest-chamber, which contains the most 
presentable of the old Doctor's ante-Revolutionary furniture. After all, the 
moderns have invented nothing better, as chamber furniture, than these chests 
of drawers, which stand on four slender legs, and rear an absolute tower of 
mahogany to the ceiling, the whole terminating in a fantastically carved 
summit. Such a venerable structure adorns our guest-chamber. In the rear of the 
house is the little room which I call my study, and which, in its day, has 
witnessed the intellectual labors of better students than myself. It contains, 
with some additions and alterations, the furniture of my bachelor-room in 
Boston; but there is a happier disposal of&nbsp;things now. There is a little 
vase of flowers on one of the bookcases, and a larger bronze vase of graceful 
ferns that surmounts the bureau. In size the room is just what it ought to be; 
for I never could compress my thoughts sufficiently to write in a very spacious 
room. It has three windows, two of which are shaded by a large and beautiful 
willow-tree, which sweeps against the overhanging eaves. On this side we have a 
view into the orchard, and, beyond, a glimpse of the river. The other window is 
the one from which Mr. Emerson, the predecessor of Dr. Ripley, beheld the first 
fight of the Revolution,--which he might well do, as the British troops were 
drawn up within a hundred yards of the house; and on looking forth just now, I 
could still perceive the western abutments of the old bridge, the passage of 
which was contested. The new monument is visible from base to summit.</p> 
<p>Notwithstanding all we have done to modernize the old place, we seem 
scarcely to have disturbed its air of antiquity. It is evident that other 
wedded pairs have spent their honeymoons here, that children have been born 
here, and people have grown old and died in these rooms, although for our 
behoof the same apartments have consented to look cheerful once again. Then 
there are dark closets, and strange nooks and corners, where the ghosts of 
former occupants might hide themselves in the daytime, and stalk forth when 
night conceals all our sacrilegious improvements. We have seen no apparitions 
as yet; but we hear strange noises, especially in the kitchen, and last night, 
while sitting in the parlor, we heard a thumping and pounding as of somebody at 
work in my study. Nay, if I mistake not (for I was half asleep), there was a 
sound&nbsp;as of some person crumpling paper in his hand in our very 
bedchamber. This must have been old Dr. Ripley with one of his sermons. There 
is a whole chest of them in the garret; but he need have no apprehensions of 
our disturbing them. I never saw the old patriarch myself, which I regret, as I 
should have been glad to associate his venerable figure at ninety years of age 
with the house in which he dwelt.</p> 
<p>Externally the house presents the same appearance as in the Doctor's day. 
It had once a coat of white paint; but the storms and sunshine of many years 
have almost obliterated it, and produced a sober, grayish hue, which entirely 
suits the antique form of the structure. To repaint its reverend face would be 
a real sacrilege. It would look like old Dr. Ripley in a brown wig. I hardly 
know why it is that our cheerful and lightsome repairs and improvements in the 
interior of the house seem to be in perfectly good taste, though the heavy old 
beams and high wainscoting of the walls speak of ages gone by. But so it is. 
The cheerful paper-hangings have the air of belonging to the old walls; and 
such modernisms as astral lamps, card-tables, gilded Cologne-bottles, silver 
taper-stands, and bronze and alabaster flower-vases, do not seem at all 
impertinent. It is thus that an aged man may keep his heart warm for new things 
and new friends, and often furnish himself anew with ideas; though it would not 
be graceful for him to attempt to suit his exterior to the passing fashions of 
the day.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><em>August</em> 9<em>th.</em>--Our orchard in its day has been a very 
productive and profitable one; and we were told that in one year it returned 
Dr. Ripley a hundred dollars, besides defraying the expense of repairing&nbsp;
the house. It is now long past its prime: many of the trees are moss-grown, and 
have dead and rotten branches intermixed among the green and fruitful ones. And 
it may well be so; for I suppose some of the trees may have been set out by Mr. 
Emerson, who died in the first year of the Revolutionary War. Neither will the 
fruit, probably, bear comparison with the delicate productions of modern 
pomology. Most of the trees seem to have abundant burdens upon them; but they 
are homely russet apples, fit only for baking and cooking. (But we are yet to 
have practical experience of our fruit.) Justice Shallow's orchard, with its 
choice pippins and leather-coats, was doubtless much superior. Nevertheless, it 
pleases me to think of the good minister, walking in the shadows of these old, 
fantastically shaped apple-trees, here plucking some of the fruit to taste, 
there pruning away a too luxuriant branch, and all the while computing how many 
barrels may be filled, and how large a sum will be added to his stipend by 
their sale. And the same trees offer their fruit to me as freely as they did to 
him,--their old branches, like withered hands and arms, holding out apples of 
the same flavor as they held out to Dr. Ripley in his lifetime. Thus the trees, 
as living existences, form a peculiar link between the dead and us. My fancy 
has always found something very interesting in an orchard. Apple-trees, and all 
fruit-trees, have a domestic character which brings them into relationship with 
man. They have lost, in a great measure, the wild nature of the forest-tree, 
and have grown humanized by receiving the care of man, and by contributing to 
his wants. They have become a part of the family; and their individual 
characters are as well understood and&nbsp;appreciated as those of the human 
members. One tree is harsh and crabbed, another mild; one is churlish and 
illiberal, another exhausts itself with its free-hearted bounties. Even the 
shapes of apple-trees have great individuality, into such strange postures do 
they put themselves, and thrust their contorted branches so grotesquely in all 
directions. And when they have stood around a house for many years, and held 
converse with successive dynasties of occupants, and gladdened their hearts so 
often in the fruitful autumn, then it would seem almost sacrilege to cut them 
down.</p> 
<p>Besides the apple-trees, there are various other kinds of fruit in close 
vicinity to the house. When we first arrived, there were several trees of ripe 
cherries, but so sour that we allowed them to wither upon the branches. Two 
long rows of currant-bushes supplied us abundantly for nearly four weeks. There 
are a good many peach-trees, but all of an old date,--their branches rotten, 
gummy, and mossy,--and their fruit, I fear, will be of very inferior quality. 
They produce most abundantly, however,--the peaches being almost as numerous as 
the leaves; and even the sprouts and suckers from the roots of the old trees 
have fruit upon them. Then there are pear-trees of various kinds, and one or 
two quince-trees. On the whole, these fruit-trees, and the other items and 
adjuncts of the place, convey a very agreeable idea of the outward comfort in 
which the good old Doctor must have spent his life. Everything seems to have 
fallen to his lot that could possibly be supposed to render the life of a 
country clergyman easy and prosperous. There is a barn, which probably used to 
be filled annually with his hay and other agricultural products. There are 
sheds, and a hen-house, and a&nbsp;pigeon-house, and an old stone pigsty, the 
open portion of which is overgrown with tall weeds, indicating that no grunter 
has recently occupied it. . . . I have serious thoughts of inducting a new 
incumbent in this part of the parsonage. It is our duty to support a pig, even 
if we have no design of feasting upon him; and, for my own part, I have a great 
sympathy and interest for the whole race of porkers, and should have much 
amusement in studying the character of a pig. Perhaps I might try to bring out 
his moral and intellectual nature, and cultivate his affections. A cat, too, 
and perhaps a dog, would be desirable additions to our household.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><em>August</em> 10<em>th.</em>--The natural taste of man for the original 
Adam's occupation is fast developing itself in me. I find that I am a good deal 
interested in our garden, although, as it was planted before we came here, I do 
not feel the same affection for the plants that I should if the seed had been 
sown by my own hands. It is something like nursing and educating another 
person's children. Still, it was a very pleasant moment when I gathered the 
first string-beans, which were the earliest esculent that the garden 
contributed to our table. And I love to watch the successive development of 
each new vegetable, and mark its daily growth, which always affects me with 
surprise. It is as if something were being created under my own inspection, and 
partly by my own aid. One day, perchance, I look at my bean-vines, and see only 
the green leaves clambering up the poles; again, to-morrow, I give a second 
glance, and there are the delicate blossoms; and a third day, on a somewhat 
closer observation, I discover the tender young beans, hiding&nbsp;among the 
foliage. Then, each morning, I watch the swelling of the pods and calculate how 
soon they will be ready to yield their treasures. All this gives a pleasure and 
an ideality, hitherto unthought of, to the business of providing sustenance for 
my family. I suppose Adam felt it in Paradise; and, of merely and exclusively 
earthly enjoyments, there are few purer and more harmless to be experienced. 
Speaking of beans, by the way, they are a classical food, and their culture 
must have been the occupation of many ancient sages and heroes. Summer-squashes 
are a very pleasant vegetable to be acquainted with. They grow in the forms of 
urns and vases,--some shallow, others deeper, and all with a beautifully 
scalloped edge. Almost any squash in our garden might be copied by a sculptor, 
and would look lovely in marble, or in china; and, if I could afford it, I 
would have exact imitations of the real vegetable as portions of my 
dining-service. They would be very appropriate dishes for holding 
garden-vegetables. Besides the summer-squashes, we have the crook-necked 
winter-squash, which I always delight to look at, when it turns up its big 
rotundity to ripen in the autumn sun. Except a pumpkin, there is no vegetable 
production that imparts such an idea of warmth and comfort to the beholder. Our 
own crop, however, does not promise to be very abundant; for the leaves formed 
such a superfluous shade over the young blossoms, that most of them dropped off 
without producing the germ of fruit. Yesterday and to-day I have cut off an 
immense number of leaves, and have thus given the remaining blossoms a chance 
to profit by the air and sunshine; but the season is too far advanced, I am 
afraid, for the squashes to attain any great bulk, and&nbsp;grow yellow in the 
sun. We have muskmelons and watermelons, which promise to supply us with as 
many as we can eat. After all, the greatest interest of these vegetables does 
not seem to consist in their being articles of food. It is rather that we love 
to see something born into the world; and when a great squash or melon is 
produced, it is a large and tangible existence, which the imagination can seize 
hold of and rejoice in. I love, also, to see my own works contributing to the 
life and well-being of animate nature. It is pleasant to have the bees come and 
suck honey out of my squash-blossoms, though, when they have laden themselves, 
they fly away to some unknown hive, which will give me back nothing in return 
for what my garden has given them. But there is much more honey in the world, 
and so I am content. Indian corn, in the prime and glory of its verdure, is a 
very beautiful vegetable, both considered in the separate plant, and in a mass 
in a broad field, rustling and waving, and surging up and down in the breeze 
and sunshine of a summer afternoon. We have as many as fifty hills, I should 
think, which will give us an abundant supply. Pray Heaven that we may be able 
to eat it all! for it is not pleasant to think that anything which Nature has 
been at the pains to produce should be thrown away. But the hens will be glad 
of our superfluity, and so will the pigs, though we have neither hens nor pigs 
of our own. But hens we must certainly keep. There is something very sociable 
and quiet, and soothing, too, in their soliloquies and converse among 
themselves; and, in an idle and half-meditative mood, it is very pleasant to 
watch a party of hens picking up their daily subsistence, with a gallant 
chanticleer in the midst of them. Milton had evidently contemplated such a 
picture with delight.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>I find that I have not given a very complete idea of our garden, although 
it certainly deserves an ample record in this chronicle, since my labors in it 
are the only present labors of my life. Besides what I have mentioned, we have 
cucumber-vines, which to-day yielded us the first cucumber of the season, a bed 
of beets, and another of carrots, and another of parsnips and turnips, none of 
which promise us a very abundant harvest. In truth, the soil is worn out, and, 
moreover, received very little manure this season. Also, we have cabbages in 
superfluous abundance, inasmuch as we neither of us have the least affection 
for them; and it would be unreasonable to expect Sarah, the cook, to eat fifty 
head of cabbages. Tomatoes, too, we shall have by and by. At our first arrival, 
we found green peas ready for gathering, and these, instead of the 
string-beans, were the first offering of the garden to our board.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><em>Saturday, August</em> 13<em>th.</em>--My life, at this time, is more 
like that of a boy, externally, than it has been since I was really a boy. It 
is usually supposed that the cares of life come with matrimony; but I seem to 
have cast off all care, and live on with as much easy trust in Providence as 
Adam could possibly have felt before he had learned that there was a world 
beyond Paradise. My chief anxiety consists in watching the prosperity of my 
vegetables, in observing how they are affected by the rain or sunshine, in 
lamenting the blight of one squash and rejoicing at the luxurious growth of 
another. It is as if the original relation between man and Nature were restored 
in my case, and as if I were to look exclusively to her for the support of my 
Eve and myself,--to trust to her for food and&nbsp;clothing, and all things 
needful, with the full assurance that she would not fail me. The fight with the 
world,--the struggle of a man among men,--the agony of the universal effort to 
wrench the means of living from a host of greedy competitors,--all this seems 
like a dream to me. My business is merely to live and to enjoy; and whatever is 
essential to life and enjoyment will come as naturally as the dew from heaven. 
This is, practically at least, my faith. And so I awake in the morning with a 
boyish thoughtlessness as to how the outgoings of the day are to be provided 
for, and its incomings rendered certain. After breakfast, I go forth into my 
garden, and gather whatever the bountiful Mother has made fit for our present 
sustenance; and of late days she generally gives me two squashes and a 
cucumber, and promises me green corn and shell-beans very soon. Then I pass 
down through our orchard to the river-side, and ramble along its margin in 
search of flowers. Usually I discern a fragrant white lily, here and there 
along the shore, growing, with sweet prudishness, beyond the grasp of mortal 
arm. But it does not escape me so. I know what is its fitting destiny better 
than the silly flower knows for itself; so I wade in, heedless of wet trousers, 
and seize the shy lily by its slender stem. Thus I make prize of five or six, 
which are as many as usually blossom within my reach in a single morning;--some 
of them partially worm-eaten or blighted, like virgins with an eating sorrow at 
the heart; others as fair and perfect as Nature's own idea was, when she first 
imagined this lovely flower. A perfect pond-lily is the most satisfactory of 
flowers. Besides these, I gather whatever else of beautiful chances to be 
growing in the moist soil by the river-side,--an&nbsp;amphibious tribe, yet 
with more richness and grace than the wild-flowers of the deep and dry 
woodlands and hedge-rows,--sometimes the white arrow-head, always the blue 
spires and broad green leaves of the pickerel-flower, which contrast and 
harmonize so well with the white lilies. For the last two or three days, I have 
found scattered stalks of the cardinal-flower, the gorgeous scarlet of which it 
is a joy even to remember. The world is made brighter and sunnier by flowers of 
such a hue. Even perfume, which otherwise is the soul and spirit of a flower, 
may be spared when it arrays itself in this scarlet glory. It is a flower of 
thought and feeling, too; it seems to have its roots deep down in the hearts of 
those who gaze at it. Other bright flowers sometimes impress me as wanting 
sentiment; but it is not so with this.</p> 
<p>Well, having made up my bunch of flowers, I return home with them. . . . 
Then I ascend to my study, and generally read, or perchance scribble in this 
journal, and otherwise suffer Time to loiter onward at his own pleasure, till 
the dinner-hour. In pleasant days, the chief event of the afternoon, and the 
happiest one of the day, is our walk. . . . So comes the night; and I look back 
upon a day spent in what the world would call idleness, and for which I myself 
can suggest no more appropriate epithet, but which, nevertheless, I cannot feel 
to have been spent amiss. True, it might be a sin and shame, in such a world as 
ours, to spend a lifetime in this manner; but for a few summer weeks it is good 
to live as if this world were heaven. And so it is, and so it shall be, 
although, in a little while, a flitting shadow of earthly care and toil will 
mingle itself with our realities.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
<p><em>Monday, August</em> 15<em>th.</em>--George Hillard and his wife arrived 
from Boston in the dusk of Saturday evening, to spend Sunday with us. It was a 
pleasant sensation, when the coach rumbled up our avenue, and wheeled round at 
the door; for I felt that I was regarded as a man with a household,--a man 
having a tangible existence and locality in the world,--when friends came to 
avail themselves of our hospitality. It was a sort of acknowledgment and 
reception of us into the corps of married people,--a sanction by no means 
essential to our peace and well-being, but yet agreeable enough to receive. So 
we welcomed them cordially at the door, and ushered them into our parlor, and 
soon into the supper-room. . . . The night flitted over us all, and passed 
away, and up rose a gray and sullen morning, . . . and we had a splendid 
breakfast of flapjacks, or slapjacks, and whortleberries, which I gathered on a 
neighboring hill, and perch, bream, and pout, which I hooked out of the river 
the evening before. About nine o'clock, Hillard and I set out for a walk to 
Walden Pond, calling by the way at Mr. Emerson's, to obtain his guidance or 
directions, and he accompanied us in his own illustrious person. We turned 
aside a little from our way, to visit Mr. ----, a yeoman, of whose homely and 
self-acquired wisdom Mr. Emerson has a very high opinion. We found him walking 
in his fields, a short and stalwart and sturdy personage of middle age, with a 
face of shrewd and kind expression, and manners of natural courtesy. He had a 
very free flow of talk; for, with a little induction from Mr. Emerson, he began 
to discourse about the state of the nation, agriculture, and business in 
general, uttering thoughts that had come to him at the plough, and which had a 
sort&nbsp;of flavor of the fresh earth about them. His views were sensible and 
characteristic, and had grown in the soil where we found them; . . . and he is 
certainly a man of intellectual and moral substance, a sturdy fact, a reality, 
something to be felt and touched, whose ideas seem to be dug out of his mind as 
he digs potatoes, beets, carrots, and turnips out of the ground.</p> 
<p>After leaving Mr. ----, we proceeded through wood-paths to Walden Pond, 
picking blackberries of enormous size along the way. The pond itself was 
beautiful and refreshing to my soul, after such long and exclusive familiarity 
with our tawny and sluggish river. It lies embosomed among wooded hills,--it is 
not very extensive, but large enough for waves to dance upon its surface, and 
to look like a piece of blue firmament, earth-encircled. The shore has a 
narrow, pebbly strand, which it was worth a day's journey to look at, for the 
sake of the contrast between it and the weedy, oozy margin of the river. 
Farther within its depths, you perceive a bottom of pure white sand, sparkling 
through the transparent water, which, methought, was the very purest liquid in 
the world. After Mr. Emerson left us, Hillard and I bathed in the pond, and it 
does really seem as if my spirit, as well as corporeal person, were refreshed 
by that bath. A good deal of mud and river slime had accumulated on my soul; 
but these bright waters washed them all away.</p> 
<p>We returned home in due season for dinner, . . . To my misfortune, however, 
a box of Mediterranean wine proved to have undergone the acetous fermentation; 
so that the splendor of the festival suffered some diminution. Nevertheless, we 
ate our dinner with a good appetite, and afterwards went universally to take
&nbsp;our several siestas. Meantime there came a shower, which so besprinkled 
the grass and shrubbery as to make it rather wet for our after-tea ramble. The 
chief result of the walk was the bringing home of an immense burden of the 
trailing clematis-vine, now just in blossom, and with which all our 
flower-stands and vases are this morning decorated. On our return we found Mr. 
and Mrs. S---- , and E. H----, who shortly took their leave, and we sat up 
late, telling ghost-stories. This morning, at seven, our friends left us. We 
were both pleased with the visit, and so, I think, were our guests.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><em>Monday, August</em> 22<em>d.</em>--I took a walk through the woods 
yesterday afternoon, to Mr. Emerson's, with a book which Margaret Fuller had 
left, after a call on Saturday eve. I missed the nearest way, and wandered into 
a very secluded portion of the forest; for forest it might justly be called, so 
dense and sombre was the shade of oaks and pines. Once I wandered into a tract 
so overgrown with bushes and underbrush that I could scarcely force a passage 
through. Nothing is more annoying than a walk of this kind, where one is 
tormented by an innumerable host of petty impediments. It incenses and 
depresses me at the same time. Always when I flounder into the midst of bushes, 
which cross and intertwine themselves about my legs, and brush my face, and 
seize hold of my clothes, with their multitudinous grip,--always, in such a 
difficulty, I feel as if it were almost as well to lie down and die in rage and 
despair as to go one step farther. It is laughable, after I have got out of the 
moil, to think how miserably it affected me for the&nbsp;moment; but I had 
better learn patience betimes, for there are many such bushy tracts in this 
vicinity, on the margins of meadows, and my walks will often lead me into them. 
Escaping from the bushes, I soon came to an open space among the woods,--a very 
lovely spot, with the tall old trees standing around as quietly as if no one 
had intruded there throughout the whole summer. A company of crows were holding 
their Sabbath on their summits. Apparently they felt themselves injured or 
insulted by my presence; for, with one consent, they began to Caw! caw! caw! 
and, launching themselves sullenly on the air, took flight to some securer 
solitude. Mine, probably, was the first human shape that they had seen all day 
long,--at least, if they had been stationary in that spot; but perhaps they had 
winged their way over miles and miles of country, had breakfasted on the summit 
of Graylock, and dined at the base of Wachusett, and were merely come to sup 
and sleep among the quiet woods of Concord. But it was my impression at the 
time, that they had sat still and silent on the tops of the trees all through 
the Sabbath day, and I felt like one who should unawares disturb an assembly of 
worshippers. A crow, however, has no real pretensions to religion, in spite of 
his gravity of mien and black attire. Crows are certainly thieves, and probably 
infidels. Nevertheless, their voices yesterday were in admirable accordance 
with the influences of the quiet, sunny, warm, yet autumnal afternoon. They 
were so far above my head that their loud clamor added to the quiet of the 
scene, instead of disturbing it. There was no other sound, except the song of 
the cricket, which is but an audible stillness; for, though it be very loud and 
heard afar, yet the mind does not take&nbsp;note of it as a sound, so entirely 
does it mingle and lose its individuality among the other characteristics of 
coming autumn. Alas for the summer! The grass is still verdant on the hills and 
in the valleys; the foliage of the trees is as dense as ever, and as green; the 
flowers are abundant along the margin of the river, and in the hedge-rows, and 
deep among the woods; the days, too, are as fervid as they were a month ago; 
and yet in every breath of wind and in every beam of sunshine there is an 
autumnal influence. I know not how to describe it. Methinks there is a sort of 
coolness amid all the heat, and a mildness in the brightest of the sunshine. A 
breeze cannot stir without thrilling me with the breath of autumn, and I behold 
its pensive glory in the far, golden gleams among the long shadows of the 
trees. The flowers, even the brightest of them,--the golden-rod and the 
gorgeous cardinals,--the most glorious flowers of the year,--have this gentle 
sadness amid their pomp. Pensive autumn is expressed in the glow of every one 
of them. I have felt this influence earlier in some years than in others. 
Sometimes autumn may be perceived even in the early days of July. There is no 
other feeling like that caused by this faint, doubtful, yet real perception, or 
rather prophecy, of the year's decay, so deliciously sweet and sad at the same 
time.</p> 
<p>After leaving the book at Mr. Emerson's I returned through the woods, and, 
entering Sleepy Hollow, I perceived a lady reclining near the path which bends 
along its verge. It was Margaret herself. She had been there the whole 
afternoon, meditating or reading; for she had a book in her hand, with some 
strange title, which I did not understand, and have forgotten. She said that 
nobody had broken her solitude, and&nbsp;was just giving utterance to a theory 
that no inhabitant of Concord ever visited Sleepy Hollow, when we saw a group 
of people entering the sacred precincts. Most of them followed a path which led 
them away from us; but an old man passed near us, and smiled to see Margaret 
reclining on the ground, and me sitting by her side. He made some remark about 
the beauty of the afternoon, and withdrew himself into the shadow of the wood. 
Then we talked about autumn, and about the pleasures of being lost in the 
woods, and about the crows, whose voices Margaret had heard; and about the 
experiences of early childhood, whose influence remains upon the character 
after the recollection of them has passed away; and about the sight of 
mountains from a distance, and the view from their summits; and about other 
matters of high and low philosophy. In the midst of our talk, we heard 
footsteps above us, on the high bank; and while the person was still hidden 
among the tree, he called to Margaret, of whom he had gotten a glimpse. Then he 
emerged from the green shade, and, behold! it was Mr. Emerson. He appeared to 
have had a pleasant time; for he said that there were Muses in the woods 
to-day, and whispers to be heard in the breezes. It being now nearly six 
o'clock, we separated,--Margaret and Mr. Emerson towards his home, and I 
towards mine. . . .</p> 
<p>Last evening there was the most beautiful moonlight that ever hallowed this 
earthly world; and when I went to bathe in the river, which was as calm as 
death, it seemed like plunging down into the sky. But I had rather be on earth 
than even in the seventh heaven, just now.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
<p><em>Wednesday, August</em> 24<em>th.</em>--I left home at five o'clock this 
morning to catch some fish for breakfast. I shook our summer apple-tree, and 
ate the golden apple which fell from it. Methinks these early apples, which 
come as a golden promise before the treasures of autumnal fruit, are almost 
more delicious than anything that comes afterwards. We have but one such tree 
in our orchard; but it supplies us with a daily abundance, and probably will do 
so for at least a week to come. Meantime other trees begin to cast their 
ripening windfalls upon the grass; and when I taste them, and perceive their 
mellowed flavor and blackening seeds, I feel somewhat overwhelmed with the 
impending bounties of Providence. I suppose Adam, in Paradise, did not like to 
see his fruits decaying on the ground, after he had watched them through the 
sunny days of the world's first summer. However, insects, at the worst, will 
hold a festival upon them, so that they will not be thrown away, in the great 
scheme of Nature. Moreover, I have one advantage over the primeval Adam, 
inasmuch as there is a chance of disposing of my superfluous fruits among 
people who inhabit no Paradise of their own.</p> 
<p>Passing a little way down along the river-side, I threw in my line, and 
soon drew out one of the smallest possible of fishes. It seemed to be a pretty 
good morning for the angler,--an autumnal coolness in the air, a clear sky, but 
with a fog across the lowlands and on the surface of the river, which a gentle 
breeze sometimes condensed into wreaths. At first, I could barely discern the 
opposite shore of the river; but, as the sun arose, the vapors gradually 
dispersed, till only a warm, smoky tint was left along the water's surface. The 
farm-houses across the river made their&nbsp;appearance out of the dusky cloud; 
the voices of boys were heard, shouting to the cattle as they drove them to the 
pastures; a man whetted his scythe, and set to work in a neighboring meadow. 
Meantime, I continued to stand on the oozy margin of the stream, beguiling the 
little fish; and though the scaly inhabitants of our river partake somewhat of 
the character of their native element, and are but sluggish biters, still I 
contrived to pull out not far from two dozen. They were all bream, a broad, 
flat, almost circular fish, shaped a good deal like a flounder, but swimming on 
their edges, instead of on their sides. As far as mere pleasure is concerned, 
it is hardly worth while to fish in our river, it is so much like angling in a 
mud-puddle; and one does not attach the idea of freshness and purity to the 
fishes, as we do to those which inhabit swift, transparent streams, or haunt 
the shores of the great briny deep. Standing on the weedy margin, and throwing 
the line over the elder-bushes that dip into the water, it seems as if we could 
catch nothing but frogs and mud-turtles, or reptiles akin to them. And even 
when a fish of reputable aspect is drawn out, one feels a shyness about 
touching him. As to our river, its character was admirably expressed last night 
by some one who said &quot;it was too lazy to keep itself clean.&quot; I might 
write pages and pages, and only obscure the impression which this brief 
sentence conveys. Nevertheless, we made bold to eat some of my fish for 
breakfast, and found them very savory; and the rest shall meet with due 
entertainment at dinner, together with some shell-beans, green corn, and 
cucumbers from our garden; so this day's food comes directly and entirely from 
beneficent Nature, without the intervention of any third person between her and 
us.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
<p><em>Saturday, August</em> 27<em>th.</em>--A peach-tree, which grows beside 
our house and brushes against the window, is so burdened with fruit that I have 
had to prop it up. I never saw more splendid peaches in appearance,--great, 
round, crimson-checked beauties, clustering all over the tree. A pear-tree, 
likewise, is maturing a generous burden of small, sweet fruit, which will 
require to be eaten at about the same time as the peaches. There is something 
pleasantly annoying in this superfluous abundance; it is like standing under a 
tree of ripe apples, and giving it a shake, with the intention of bringing down 
a single one, when, behold, a dozen come thumping about our ears. But the idea 
of the infinite generosity and exhaustless bounty of our Mother Nature is well 
worth attaining; and I never had it so vividly as now, when I find myself, with 
the few mouths which I am to feed, the sole inheritor of the old clergyman's 
wealth of fruits. His children, his friends in the village, and the clerical 
guests who came to preach in his pulpit, were all wont to eat and be filled 
from these trees. Now, all these hearty old people have passed away, and in 
their stead is a solitary pair, whose appetites are more than satisfied with 
the windfalls which the trees throw down at their feet. Howbeit, we shall have 
now and then a guest to keep our peaches and pears from decaying.</p> 
<p>G. B----, my old fellow-laborer at the community at Brook Farm, called on 
me last evening, and dined here to-day. He has been cultivating vegetables at 
Plymouth this summer, and selling them in the market. What a singular mode of 
life for a man of education and refinement,--to spend his days in hard and 
earnest bodily toil, and then to convey the products of his labor, in a 
wheelbarrow, to the public&nbsp;market, and there retail them out,--a peck of 
peas or beans, a bunch of turnips, a squash, a dozen ears of green corn! Few 
men, without some eccentricity of character, would have the moral strength to 
do this; and it is very striking to find such strength combined with the utmost 
gentleness, and an uncommon regularity of nature. Occasionally he returns for a 
day or two to resume his place among scholars and idle people, as, for 
instance, the present week, when he has thrown aside his spade and hoe to 
attend the Commencement at Cambridge. He is a rare man,--a perfect original, 
yet without any one salient point; a character to be felt and understood, but 
almost impossible to describe; for, should you seize upon any characteristic, 
it would inevitably be altered and distorted in the process of writing it down.
</p> 
<p>Our few remaining days of summer have been latterly grievously darkened 
with clouds. To-day there has been an hour or two of hot sunshine; but the sun 
rose amid cloud and mist, and before he could dry up the moisture of last 
night's shower upon the trees and grass, the clouds have gathered between him 
and us again. This afternoon the thunder rumbles in the distance, and I believe 
a few drops of rain have fallen; but the weight of the shower has burst 
elsewhere, leaving us nothing but its sullen gloom. There is a muggy warmth in 
the atmosphere, which takes all the spring and vivacity out of the mind and 
body.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><em>Sunday, August</em> 28<em>th.</em>--Still another rainy day,--the 
heaviest rain, I believe, that has fallen since we came to Concord (not two 
months ago). There never was a more sombre aspect of all external nature. I 
gaze from the open window of my study somewhat&nbsp;disconsolately, and observe 
the great willow-tree which shades the house, and which has caught and retained 
a whole cataract of rain among its leaves and boughs; and all the fruit-trees, 
too, are dripping continually, even in the brief intervals when the clouds give 
us a respite. If shaken to bring down the fruit, they will discharge a shower 
upon the head of him who stands beneath. The rain is warm, coming from some 
southern region; but the willow attests that it is an autumnal spell of 
weather, by scattering down no infrequent multitude of yellow leaves, which 
rest upon the sloping roof of the house, and strew the gravel-path and the 
grass. The other trees do not yet shed their leaves, though in some of them a 
lighter tint of verdure, tending towards yellow, is perceptible. All day long 
we hear the water drip, drip, dripping, splash, splash, splashing, from the 
eaves, and babbling and foaming into the tubs which have been set out to 
receive it. The old unpainted shingles and boards of the mansion and out-houses 
are black with the moisture which they have imbibed. Looking at the river, we 
perceive that its usually smooth and mirrored surface is blurred by the 
infinity of rain-drops; the whole landscape--grass, trees, and houses--has a 
completely water-soaked aspect, as if the earth were wet through. The wooded 
hill, about a mile distant, whither we went to gather whortleberries, has a 
mist upon its summit, as if the demon of the rain were enthroned there; and if 
we look to the sky, it seems as if all the water that had been poured down upon 
us were as nothing to what is to come. Once in a while, indeed, there is a 
gleam of sky along the horizon, or a half-cheerful, half-sullen lighting up of 
the atmosphere; the rain-drops cease to patter down,&nbsp;except when the trees 
shake off a gentle shower; but soon we hear the broad, quiet, slow, and sure 
recommencement of the rain. The river, if I mistake not, has risen considerably 
during the day, and its current will acquire some degree of energy.</p> 
<p>In this sombre weather, when some mortals almost forget that there ever was 
any golden sunshine, or ever will be any hereafter, others seem absolutely to 
radiate it from their own hearts and minds. The gloom cannot pervade them; they 
conquer it, and drive it quite out of their sphere, and create a moral rainbow 
of hope upon the blackest cloud. As for myself, I am little other than a cloud 
at such seasons, but such persons contrive to make me a sunny one, shining all 
through me. And thus, even without the support of a stated occupation, I 
survive these sullen days and am happy.</p> 
<p>This morning we read the Sermon on the Mount. In the course of the 
forenoon, the rain abated for a season, and I went out and gathered some corn 
and summer-squashes, and picked up the windfalls of apples and pears and 
peaches. Wet, wet, wet,--everything was wet; the blades of the corn-stalks 
moistened me; the wet grass soaked my boots quite through; the trees threw 
their reserved showers upon my head; and soon the remorseless rain began anew, 
and drove me into the house. When shall we be able to walk again to the far 
hills, and plunge into the deep woods, and gather more cardinals along the 
river's margin? The track along which we trod is probably under water now. How 
inhospitable Nature is during a rain! In the fervid heat of sunny days, she 
still retains some degree of mercy for us; she has shady spots, whither the sun 
cannot come; but she provides&nbsp;no shelter against her storms. It makes one 
shiver to think how dripping with wet are those deep, umbrageous nooks, those 
overshadowed banks, where we find such enjoyment during sultry afternoons. And 
what becomes of the birds in such a soaking rain as this? Is hope and an 
instinctive faith so mixed up with their nature that they can be cheered by the 
thought that the sunshine will return? or do they think, as I almost do, that 
there is to be no sunshine any more? Very disconsolate must they be among the 
dripping leaves; and when a single summer makes so important a portion of their 
lives, it seems hard that so much of it should be dissolved in rain. I, 
likewise, am greedy of the summer days for my own sake; the life of man does 
not contain so many of them that one can be spared without regret.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><em>Tuesday, August</em> 30<em>th.</em>--I was promised, in the midst of 
Sunday's rain, that Monday should be fair, and, behold! the sun came back to 
us, and brought one of the most perfect days ever made since Adam was driven 
out of Paradise. By the by, was there ever any rain in Paradise? If so, how 
comfortless must Eve's bower have been! and what a wretched and rheumatic time 
must they have had on their bed of wet roses! It makes me shiver to think of 
it. Well, it seemed as if the world was newly created yesterday morning, and I 
beheld its birth; for I had risen before the sun was over the hill, and had 
gone forth to fish. How instantaneously did all dreariness and heaviness of the 
earth's spirit flit away before one smile of the beneficent sun! This proves 
that all gloom is but a dream and a shadow, and that cheerfulness is the real 
truth. It requires many clouds,&nbsp;long brooding over us, to make us sad, but 
one gleam of sunshine always suffices to cheer up the landscape. The banks of 
the river actually laughed when the sunshine fell upon them; and the river 
itself was alive and cheerful, and, by way of fun and amusement, it had swept 
away many wreaths of meadow-hay, and old, rotten branches of trees, and all 
such trumpery. These matters came floating downwards, whirling round and round 
in the eddies, or hastening onward in the main current; and many of them, 
before this time, have probably been carried into the Merrimack, and will be 
borne onward to the sea. The spots where I stood to fish, on my preceding 
excursion, were now under water; and the tops of many of the bushes, along the 
river's margin, barely emerged from the stream. Large spaces of meadow are 
overflowed.</p> 
<p>There was a northwest-wind throughout the day; and as many clouds, the 
remnants of departed gloom, were scattered about the sky, the breeze was 
continually blowing them across the sun. For the most part, they were gone 
again in a moment; but sometimes the shadow remained long enough to make me 
dread a return of sulky weather. Then would come the burst of sunshine, making 
me feel as if a rainy day were henceforth an impossibility. . . .</p> 
<p>In the afternoon Mr. Emerson called, bringing Mr. ----. </p> 
<p>He is a good sort of humdrum parson enough, and well fitted to increase the 
stock of manuscript sermons, of which there must be a fearful quantity already 
in the world. Mr. ----, however, is probably one of the best and most useful of 
his class, because no suspicion of the necessity of his profession, constituted 
as it now is, to mankind, and of his own usefulness and success in it, has 
hitherto disturbed him; and&nbsp;therefore, he labors with faith and 
confidence, as ministers did a hundred years ago.</p> 
<p>After the visitors were gone, I sat at the gallery window, looking down the 
avenue; and soon there appeared an elderly woman,--a homely, decent old matron, 
dressed in a dark gown, and with what seemed a manuscript book under her arm. 
The wind sported with her gown, and blew her veil across her face, and seemed 
to make game of her, though on a nearer view she looked like a sad old 
creature, with a pale, thin countenance, and somewhat of a wild and wandering 
expression. She had a singular gait, reeling, as it were, and yet not quite 
reeling, from one side of the path to the other; going onward as if it were not 
much matter whether she went straight or crooked. Such were my observations as 
she approached through the scattered sunshine and shade of our long avenue, 
until, reaching the door, she gave a knock, and inquired for the lady of the 
house. Her manuscript contained a certificate, stating that the old woman was a 
widow from a foreign land, who had recently lost her son, and was now utterly 
destitute of friends and kindred, and without means of support. Appended to the 
certificate there was a list of names of people who had bestowed charity on 
her, with the amounts of the several donations,--none, as I recollect, higher 
than twenty-five cents. Here is a strange life, and a character fit for romance 
and poetry. All the early part of her life, I suppose, and much of her 
widowhood, were spent in the quiet of a home, with kinsfolk around her, and 
children, and the lifelong gossiping acquaintances that some women always 
create about them. But in her decline she has wandered away from all these, and 
from her native country itself, and is a vagrant, yet with&nbsp;something of 
the homeliness and decency of aspect belonging to one who has been a wife and 
mother, and has had a roof of her own above her head,--and, with all this, a 
wildness proper to her present life. I have a liking for vagrants of all sorts, 
and never, that I know of, refused my mite to a wandering beggar, when I had 
anything in my own pocket. There is so much wretchedness in the world, that we 
may safely take the word of any mortal professing to need our assistance; and, 
even should we be deceived, still the good to ourselves resulting from a kind 
act is worth more than the trifle by which we purchase it. It is desirable, I 
think, that such persons should be permitted to roam through our land of 
plenty, scattering the seeds of tenderness and charity, as birds of passage 
bear the seeds of precious plants from land to land, without even dreaming of 
the office which they perform.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><em>Thursday, September</em> 1<em>st.</em>--Mr. Thoreau dined with us 
yesterday. . . . He is a keen and delicate observer of nature,--a genuine 
observer,--which, I suspect, is almost as rare a character as even an original 
poet; and Nature, in return for his love, seems to adopt him as her especial 
child, and shows him secrets which few others are allowed to witness. He is 
familiar with beast, fish, fowl, and reptile, and has strange stories to tell 
of adventures and friendly passages with these lower brethren of mortality. 
Herb and flower, likewise, wherever they grow, whether in garden or wildwood, 
are his familiar friends. He is also on intimate terms with the clouds, and can 
tell the portents of storms. It is a characteristic trait, that he has a great 
regard for the memory of the Indian tribes, whose wild life would have suited 
him so well; and,&nbsp;strange to say, he seldom walks over a ploughed field 
without picking up an arrow-point, spear-head, or other relic of the red man, 
as if their spirits willed him to be the inheritor of their simple wealth.</p> 
<p>With all this he has more than a tincture of literature,--a deep and true 
taste for poetry, especially for the elder poets, and he is a good writer,--at 
least he has written a good article, a rambling disquisition on Natural 
History, in the last &quot;Dial,&quot; which, he says, was chiefly made up from 
journals of his own observations. Methinks this article gives a very fair image 
of his mind and character,--so true, innate, and literal in observation, yet 
giving the spirit as well as letter of what he sees, even as a lake reflects 
its wooded banks, showing every leaf, yet giving the wild beauty of the whole 
scene. Then there are in the article passages of cloudy and dreamy metaphysics, 
and also passages where his thoughts seem to measure and attune themselves into 
spontaneous verse, as they rightfully may, since there is real poetry in them. 
There is a basis of good sense and of moral truth, too, throughout the article, 
which also is a reflection of his character; for he is not unwise to think and 
feel, and I find him a healthy and wholesome man to know.</p> 
<p>After dinner (at which we cut the first watermelon and muskmelon that our 
garden has grown), Mr. Thoreau and I walked up the bank of the river, and at a 
certain point he shouted for his boat. Forthwith a young man paddled it across, 
and Mr. Thoreau and I voyaged farther up the stream, which soon became more 
beautiful than any picture, with its dark and quiet sheet of water, half 
shaded, half sunny, between high and wooded banks. The late rains have swollen 
the stream so much that many trees are standing up&nbsp;to their knees, as it 
were, in the water, and boughs, which lately swung high in air, now dip and 
drink deep of the passing wave. As to the poor cardinals which glowed upon the 
bank a few days since, I could see only a few of their scarlet hats, peeping 
above the tide. Mr. Thoreau managed the boat so perfectly, either with two 
paddles or with one, that it seemed instinct with his own will, and to require 
no physical effort to guide it. He said that, when some Indians visited Concord 
a few years ago, he found that he had acquired, without a teacher, their 
precise method of propelling and steering a canoe. Nevertheless he was desirous 
of selling the boat of which he was so fit a pilot, and which was built by his 
own hands; so I agreed to take it, and accordingly became possessor of the 
Musketaquid. I wish I could acquire the aquatic skill of the original owner.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><em>September</em> 2<em>d.</em>--Yesterday afternoon Mr. Thoreau arrived 
with the boat. The adjacent meadow being overflowed by the rise of the stream, 
he had rowed directly to the foot of the orchard, and landed at the bars, after 
floating over forty or fifty yards of water where people were lately making 
hay. I entered the boat with him, in order to have the benefit of a lesson in 
rowing and paddling, . . . I managed, indeed, to propel the boat by rowing with 
two oars, but the use of the single paddle is quite beyond my present skill. 
Mr. Thoreau had assured me that it was only necessary to will the boat to go in 
any particular direction, and she would immediately take that course, as if 
imbued with the spirit of the steersman. It may be so with him, but it is 
certainly not so with me. The boat seemed to be bewitched, and turned its head 
to&nbsp;every point of the compass except the right one. He then took the 
paddle himself, and, though I could observe nothing peculiar in his management 
of it, the Musketaquid immediately became as docile as a trained steed. I 
suspect that she has not yet transferred her affections from her old master to 
her new one. By and by, when we are better acquainted, she will grow more 
tractable. . . . We propose to change her name from Musketaquid (the Indian 
name of the Concord River, meaning the river of meadows) to the Pond-Lily, 
which will be very beautiful and appropriate, as, during the summer season, she 
will bring home many a cargo of pond-lilies from along the river s weedy shore. 
It is not very likely that I shall make such long voyages in her as Mr. Thoreau 
has made. He once followed our river down to the Merrimack, and thence, I 
believe, to Newburyport in this little craft.</p> 
<p>In the evening, ---- ----called to see us, wishing to talk with me about a 
Boston periodical, of which he had heard that I was to be editor, and to which 
he desired to contribute. He is an odd and clever young man, with nothing very 
peculiar about him,--some originality and self-inspiration in his character, 
but none, or, very little, in his intellect. Nevertheless, the lad himself 
seems to feel as if he were a genius. I like him well enough, however; but, 
after all, these originals in a small way, after one has seen a few of them, 
become more dull and commonplace than even those who keep the ordinary pathway 
of life. They have a rule and a routine, which they follow with as little 
variety as other people do their rule and routine; and when once we have 
fathomed their mystery, nothing can be more wearisome. An innate perception
&nbsp;and reflection of truth give the only sort of originality that does not 
finally grow intolerable.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><em>September</em> 4<em>th.</em>--I made a voyage in the Pond-Lily all by 
myself yesterday morning, and was much encouraged by my success in causing the 
boat to go whither I would. I have always liked to be afloat, but I think I 
have never adequately conceived of the enjoyment till now, when I begin to feel 
a power over that which supports me. I suppose I must have felt something like 
this sense of triumph when I first learned to swim; but I have forgotten it. Oh 
that I could run wild!--that is, that I could put myself into a true relation 
with Nature, and be on friendly terms with all congenial elements.</p> 
<p>We had a thunder-storm last evening; and to-day has been a cool, breezy, 
autumnal day, such as my soul and body love.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><em>September</em> 18<em>th.</em>--How the summer-time flits away, even 
while it seems to be loitering onward, arm in arm with autumn! Of late I have 
walked but little over the hills and through the woods, my leisure being 
chiefly occupied with my boat, which I have now learned to manage with 
tolerable skill. Yesterday afternoon I made a voyage alone up the North Branch 
of Concord River. There was a strong west-wind blowing dead against me, which, 
together with the current, increased by the height of the water, made the first 
part of the passage pretty toilsome. The black river was all dimpled over with 
little eddies and whirlpools; and the breeze, moreover, caused the billows to 
beat against the bow of the boat, with a sound like the flapping of a bird's 
wing. The water-weeds,&nbsp;where they were discernible through the tawny 
water, were straight outstretched by the force of the current, looking as if 
they were forced to hold on to their roots with all their might. If for a 
moment I desisted from paddling, the head of the boat was swept round by the 
combined might of wind and tide. However, I toiled onward stoutly, and, 
entering the North Branch, soon found myself floating quietly along a tranquil 
stream, sheltered from the breeze by the woods and a lofty hill. The current, 
likewise, lingered along so gently that it was merely a pleasure to propel the 
boat against it. I never could have conceived that there was so beautiful a 
river-scene in Concord as this of the North Branch. The stream flows through 
the midmost privacy and deepest heart of a wood, which, as if but half 
satisfied with its presence, calm, gentle, and unobtrusive as it is, seems to 
crowd upon it, and barely to allow it passage; for the trees are rooted on the 
very verge of the water, and dip their pendent branches into it. On one side 
there is a high bank, forming the side of a hill, the Indian name of which I 
have forgotten, though Mr. Thoreau told it to me; and here, in some instances, 
the trees stand leaning over the river, stretching out their arms as if about 
to plunge in headlong. On the other side, the bank is almost on a level with 
the water; and there the quiet congregation of trees stood with feet in the 
flood, and fringed with foliage down to its very surface. Vines here and there 
twine themselves about bushes or aspens or alder-trees, and hang their clusters 
(though scanty and infrequent this season) so that I can reach them from my 
boat. I scarcely remember a scene of more complete and lovely seclusion than 
the passage of the river through this wood. Even an Indian canoe, in olden&nbsp;
times, could not have floated onward in deeper solitude than my boat. I have 
never elsewhere had such an opportunity to observe how much more beautiful 
reflection is than what we call reality. The sky, and the clustering foliage on 
either hand, and the effect of sunlight as it found its way through the shade, 
giving lightsome hues in contrast with the quiet depth of the prevailing 
tints,--all these seemed unsurpassably beautiful when beheld in upper air. But 
on gazing downward, there they were, the same even to the minutest particular, 
yet arrayed in ideal beauty, which satisfied the spirit incomparably more than 
the actual scene. I am half convinced that the reflection is indeed the 
reality, the real thing which Nature imperfectly images to our grosser sense. 
At any rate, the disembodied shadow is nearest to the soul.</p> 
<p>There were many tokens of autumn in this beautiful picture. Two or three of 
the trees were actually dressed in their coats of many colors,--the real 
scarlet and gold which they wear before they put on mourning. These stood on 
low, marshy spots, where a frost has probably touched them already. Others were 
of a light, fresh green, resembling the hues of spring, though this, likewise, 
is a token of decay. The great mass of the foliage, however, appears unchanged; 
but ever and anon down came a yellow leaf, half flitting upon the air, half 
falling through it, and finally settling upon the water. A multitude of these 
were floating here and there along the river, many of them curling upward, so 
as to form little boats, fit for fairies to voyage in. They looked strangely 
pretty, with yet a melancholy prettiness, as they floated along. The general 
aspect of the river, however, differed but little from that of summer,--at 
least the difference&nbsp;defies expression. It is more in the character of the 
rich yellow sunlight than in aught else. The water of the stream has now a 
thrill of autumnal coolness; yet whenever a broad gleam fell across it, through 
an interstice of the foliage, multitudes of insects were darting to and fro 
upon its surface. The sunshine, thus falling across the dark river, has a most 
beautiful effect. It burnishes it, as it were, and yet leaves it as dark as 
ever.</p> 
<p>On my return, I suffered the boat to float almost of its own will down the 
stream, and caught fish enough for this morning's breakfast. But, partly from a 
qualm of conscience, I finally put them all into the water again, and saw them 
swim away as if nothing had happened.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><em>Monday, October</em> 10<em>th.</em>--A long while, indeed, since my 
last date. But the weather has been generally sunny and pleasant, though often 
very cold; and I cannot endure to waste anything so precious as autumnal 
sunshine by staying in the house. So I have spent almost all the daylight hours 
in the open air. My chief amusement has been boating up and down the river. A 
week or two ago (September 27 and 28) I went on a pedestrian excursion with Mr. 
Emerson, and was gone two days and one night, it being the first and only night 
that I have spent away from home. We were that night at the village of Harvard, 
and the next morning walked three miles farther, to the Shaker village, where 
we breakfasted. Mr. Emerson had a theological discussion with two of the Shaker 
brethren; but the particulars of it have faded from my memory; and all the 
other adventures of the tour have now so lost their freshness that I cannot
&nbsp;adequately recall them. Wherefore let them rest untold. I recollect 
nothing so well as the aspect of some fringed gentians, which we saw growing by 
the roadside, and which were so beautiful that I longed to turn back and pluck 
them. After an arduous journey, we arrived safe home in the afternoon of the 
second day,--the first time that I ever came home in my life; for I never had a 
home before. On Saturday of the same week, my friend D. R---- came to see us, 
and stayed till Tuesday morning. On Wednesday there was a cattle-show in the 
village, of which I would give a description, if it had possessed any 
picturesque points. The foregoing are the chief outward events of our life.</p> 
<p>In the mean time autumn has been advancing, and is said to be a month 
earlier than usual. We had frosts, sufficient to kill the bean and squash 
vines, more than a fortnight ago; but there has since been some of the most 
delicious Indian-summer weather that I ever experienced,--mild, sweet, perfect 
days, in which the warm sunshine seemed to embrace the earth and all earth's 
children with love and tenderness. Generally, however, the bright days have 
been vexed with winds from the northwest, somewhat too keen and high for 
comfort. These winds have strewn our avenue with withered leaves, although the 
trees still retain some density of foliage, which is now imbrowned or otherwise 
variegated by autumn. Our apples, too, have been falling, falling, falling; and 
we have picked the fairest of them from the dewy grass, and put them in our 
storeroom and elsewhere. On Thursday, John Flint began to gather those which 
remained on the trees; and I suppose they will amount to nearly twenty barrels, 
or perhaps more. As usual&nbsp;when I have anything to sell, apples are very 
low indeed in price, and will not fetch me more than a dollar a barrel. I have 
sold my share of the potato-field for twenty dollars and ten bushels of 
potatoes for my own use. This may suffice for the economical history of our 
recent life.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>12 o'clock, M.--Just now I heard a sharp tapping at the window of my study, 
and, looking up from my book (a volume of Rabelais), behold! the head of a 
little bird, who seemed to demand admittance! He was probably attempting to get 
a fly, which was on the pane of glass against which he rapped; and on my first 
motion the feathered visitor took wing. This incident had a curious effect on 
me. It impressed me as if the bird had been a spiritual visitant, so strange 
was it that this little wild thing should seem to ask our hospitality.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><em>November</em> 8<em>th.</em>--I am sorry that our journal has fallen so 
into neglect; but I see no chance of amendment. All my scribbling propensities 
will be far more than gratified in writing nonsense for the press; so that any 
gratuitous labor of the pen becomes peculiarly distasteful. Since the last 
date, we have paid a visit of nine days to Boston and Salem, whence we returned 
a week ago yesterday. Thus we lost above a week of delicious autumnal weather, 
which should have been spent in the woods or upon the river. Ever since our 
return, however, until to-day, there has been a succession of genuine 
Indian-summer days, with gentle winds, or none at all, and a misty atmosphere, 
which idealizes all nature, and a mild, beneficent sunshine, inviting one to 
lie down in a nook and forget&nbsp;all earthly care. To-day the sky is dark and 
lowering, and occasionally lets fall a few sullen tears. I suppose we must bid 
farewell to Indian summer now, and expect no more love and tenderness from 
Mother Nature till next spring be well advanced. She has already made herself 
as unlovely in outward aspect as can well be. We took a walk to Sleepy Hollow 
yesterday, and beheld scarcely a green thing, except the everlasting verdure of 
the family of pines, which, indeed, are trees to thank God for at this season. 
A range of young birches had retained a pretty liberal coloring of yellow or 
tawny leaves, which became very cheerful in the sunshine. There were one or two 
oak-trees whose foliage still retained a deep, dusky red, which looked rich and 
warm; but most of the oaks had reached the last stage of autumnal decay,--the 
dusky brown hue. Millions of their leaves strew the woods and rustle underneath 
the foot; but enough remain upon the boughs to make a melancholy harping when 
the wind sweeps over them. We found some fringed gentians in the meadow, most 
of them blighted and withered; but a few were quite perfect. The other day, 
since our return from Salem, I found a violet; yet it was so cold that day, 
that a large pool of water, under the shadow of some trees, had remained frozen 
from morning till afternoon. The ice was so thick as not to be broken by some 
sticks and small stones which I threw upon it. But ice and snow too will soon 
be no extraordinary matters with us.</p> 
<p>During the last week we have had three stoves put up, and henceforth no 
light of a cheerful fire will gladden us at eventide. Stoves are detestable in 
every respect, except that they keep us perfectly comfortable.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
<p><em>Thursday, November</em> 24<em>th.</em>--This is Thanksgiving Day, a 
good old festival, and we have kept it with our hearts, and, besides, have made 
good cheer upon our turkey and pudding, and pies and custards, although none 
sat at our board but our two selves. There was a new and livelier sense, I 
think, that we have at last found a home, and that a new family has been 
gathered since the last Thanksgiving Day. There have been many bright, cold 
days latterly,--so cold that it has required a pretty rapid pace to keep one's 
self warm a-walking. Day before yesterday I saw a party of boys skating on a 
pond of water that has overflowed a neighboring meadow. Running water has not 
yet frozen. Vegetation has quite come to a stand, except in a few sheltered 
spots. In a deep ditch we found a tall plant of the freshest and healthiest 
green, which looked as if it must have grown within the last few weeks. We 
wander among the wood-paths, which are very pleasant in the sunshine of the 
afternoons, the trees looking rich and warm,--such of them, I mean, as have 
retained their russet leaves; and where the leaves are strewn along the paths, 
or heaped plentifully in some hollow of the hills, the effect is not without a 
charm. To-day the morning rose with rain, which has since changed to snow and 
sleet; and now the landscape is as dreary as can well be imagined,--white, with 
the brownness of the soil and withered grass everywhere peeping out. The 
swollen river, of a leaden hue, drags itself sullenly along; and this may be 
termed the first winter's day.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<h3>[1843]</h3> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><em>Friday, March</em> 31<em>st,</em> 1843.--The first month of spring is 
already gone; and still the snow lies deep on hill and valley, and the river is 
still frozen from bank&nbsp;to bank, although a late rain has caused pools of 
water to stand on the surface of the ice, and the meadows are overflowed into 
broad lakes. Such a protracted winter has not been known for twenty years, at 
least. I have almost forgotten the wood-paths and shady places which I used to 
know so well last summer; and my views are so much confined to the interior of 
our mansion, that sometimes, looking out of the window, I am surprised to catch 
a glimpse of houses, at no great distance, which had quite passed out of my 
recollection. From present appearances, another month may scarcely suffice to 
wash away all the snow from the open country; and in the woods and hollows it 
may linger yet longer. The winter will not have been a day less than five 
months long; and it would not be unfair to call it seven. A great space, 
indeed, to miss the smile of Nature, in a single year of human life. Even out 
of the midst of happiness I have sometimes sighed and groaned; for I love the 
sunshine and the green woods, and the sparkling blue water; and it seems as if 
the picture of our inward bliss should be set in a beautiful frame of outward 
nature. . . . As to the daily course of our life, I have written with pretty 
commendable diligence, averaging from two to four hours a day; and the result 
is seen in various magazines. I might have written more, if it had seemed worth 
while, but I was content to earn only so much gold as might suffice for our 
immediate wants, having prospect of official station and emolument which would 
do away with the necessity of writing for bread. Those prospects have not yet 
had their fulfilment; and we are well content to wait, because an office would 
inevitably remove us from our present happy home,--at least from an outward 
home; for there is an inner one&nbsp;that will accompany us wherever we go. 
Meantime, the magazine people do not pay their debts; so that we taste some of 
the inconveniences of poverty. It is an annoyance, not a trouble.</p> 
<p>Every day, I trudge through snow and slosh to the village, look into the 
post-office, and spend an hour at the reading-room; and then return home, 
generally without having spoken a word to a human being. . . . In the way of 
exercise I saw and split wood, and, physically, I never was in a better 
condition than now. This is chiefly owing, doubtless, to a satisfied heart, in 
aid of which comes the exercise above mentioned, and about a fair proportion of 
intellectual labor.</p> 
<p>On the 9th of this month, we left home again on a visit to Boston and 
Salem. I alone went to Salem, where I resumed all my bachelor habits for nearly 
a fortnight, leading the same life in which ten years of my youth flitted away 
like a dream. But how much changed was I! At last I had caught hold of a 
reality which never could be taken from me. It was good thus to get apart from 
my happiness, for the sake of contemplating it. On the 2lst, I returned to 
Boston, and went out to Cambridge to dine with Longfellow, whom I had not seen 
since his return from Europe. The next day we came back to our old house, which 
had been deserted all this time; for our servant had gone with us to Boston.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><em>Friday, April</em> 7<em>th.</em>--My wife has gone to Boston to see her 
sister M----, who is to be married in two or three weeks, and then immediately 
to visit Europe for six months, . . . I betook myself to sawing and splitting 
wood; there being an inward unquietness which demanded active exercise, and I 
sawed, I think,&nbsp;more briskly than ever before. When I re&euml;ntered the 
house, it was with somewhat of a desolate feeling; yet not without an 
intermingled pleasure, as being the more conscious that all separation was 
temporary, and scarcely real, even for the little time that it may last. After 
my solitary dinner, I lay down, with the &quot;Dial&quot; in my hand, and 
attempted to sleep; but sleep would not come. . . . So I arose, and began this 
record in the journal, almost at the commencement of which I was interrupted by 
a visit from Mr. Thoreau, who came to return a book, and to announce his 
purpose of going to reside at Staten Island, as private tutor in the family of 
Mr. Emerson's brother. We had some conversation upon this subject, and upon the 
spiritual advantages of change of place, and upon the &quot;Dial,&quot; and 
upon Mr. Alcott, and other kindred or concatenated subjects. I am glad, on Mr. 
Thoreau's own account, that he is going away, as he is out of health, and may 
be benefited by his removal; but, on my account, I should like to have him 
remain here, he being one of the few persons, I think, with whom to hold 
intercourse is like hearing the wind among the boughs of a forest-tree; and, 
with all this wild freedom, there is high and classic cultivation in him too. . 
. .</p> 
<p>I had a purpose, if circumstances would permit, of passing the whole term 
of my wife's absence without speaking a word to any human being; but now my 
Pythagorean vow has been broken, within three or four hours after her departure.
</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><em>Saturday, April</em> 8<em>th.</em>--After journalizing yesterday 
afternoon, I went out and sawed and split wood till teatime, then studied 
German (translating &quot;Lenore&quot;), with an occasional glance at a 
beautiful&nbsp;sunset, which I could not enjoy sufficiently by myself to induce 
me to lay aside the book. After lamplight, finished &quot;Lenore,&quot; and 
drowsed over Voltaire's &quot;Candide,&quot; occasionally refreshing myself 
with a tune from Mr. Thoreau's musical-box, which he had left in my keeping. 
The evening was but a dull one.</p> 
<p>I retired soon after nine, and felt some apprehension that the old Doctor's 
ghost would take this opportunity to visit me; but I rather think his former 
visitations have not been intended for me, and that I am not sufficiently 
spiritual for ghostly communication. At all events, I met with no disturbance 
of the kind, and slept soundly enough till six o'clock or thereabouts. The 
forenoon was spent with the pen in my hand, and sometimes I had the glimmering 
of an idea, and endeavored to materialize it in words; but on the whole my mind 
was idly vagrant, and refused to work to any systematic purpose. Between eleven 
amid twelve I went to the post-office, but found no letter; then spent above an 
hour reading at the Athen&aelig;um. On my way home, I encountered Mr. Flint, 
for the first time these many weeks, although he is our next neighbor in one 
direction. I inquired if he could sell us some potatoes, and he promised to 
send half a bushel for trial. Also, he encouraged me to hope that he might buy 
a barrel of our apples. After my encounter with Mr. Flint, I returned to our 
lonely old abbey, opened the door without the usual heart-spring, ascended to 
my study, and began to read a tale of Tieck. Slow work, and dull work too! 
Anon, Molly, the cook, rang the bell for dinner,--a sumptuous banquet of stewed 
veal and macaroni, to which I sat down in solitary state. My appetite served me 
sufficiently to eat with, but not for enjoyment. Nothing has a zest&nbsp;in my 
present widowed state. [Thus far I had written, when Mr. Emerson called.] After 
dinner, I lay down on the couch, with the &quot;Dial&quot; in my hand as a 
soporific, and had a short nap; then began to journalize.</p> 
<p>Mr. Emerson came, with a sunbeam in his face; and we had as good a talk as 
I ever remember to have had with him. He spoke of Margaret Fuller, who, he 
says, has risen perceptibly into a higher state since their last meeting. 
[There rings the tea-bell.] Then we discoursed of Ellery Channing, a volume of 
whose poems is to be immediately published, with revisions by Mr. Emerson 
himself and Mr. Sam G. Ward. . . . He calls them &quot;poetry for poets.&quot; 
Next Mr. Thoreau was discussed, and his approaching departure; in respect to 
which we agreed pretty well, . . . We talked of Brook Farm, and the singular 
moral aspects which it presents, and the great desirability that its progress 
and developments should be observed and its history written; also of C. N----, 
who, it appears, is passing through a new moral phasis. He is silent, 
inexpressive, talks little or none, and listens without response, except a 
sardonic laugh and some of his friends think that he is passing into permanent 
eclipse. Various other matters were considered or glanced at, and finally, 
between five and six o'clock, Mr. Emerson took his leave. I then went out to 
chop wood, my allotted space for which had been very much abridged by his 
visit; but I was not sorry. I went on with the journal for a few minutes before 
tea, and have finished the present record in the setting sunshine and gathering 
dusk. . . .</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Salem.--. . . Here I am, in my old chamber,&nbsp;where I produced those 
stupendous works of fiction which have since impressed the universe with 
wonderment and awe! To this chamber, doubtless, in all succeeding ages, 
pilgrims will come to pay their tribute of reverence; they will put off their 
shoes at the threshold for fear of desecrating the tattered old carpets! 
&quot;There,&quot; they will exclaim, &quot;is the very bed in which he 
slumbered, and where he was visited by those ethereal visions which he 
afterwards fixed forever in glowing words! There is the wash-stand at which 
this exalted personage cleansed himself from the stains of earth, and rendered 
his outward man a fitting exponent of the pure soul within. There, in its 
mahogany frame, is the dressing-glass, which often reflected that noble brow, 
those hyacinthine locks, that mouth bright with smiles or tremulous with 
feeling, that flashing or melting eye, that--in short, every item of the 
magnanimous face of this unexampled man. There is the pine table,--there the 
old flag-bottomed chair on which he sat, and at which he scribbled, during his 
agonies of inspiration! There is the old chest of drawers in which he kept what 
shirts a poor author may he supposed to have possessed! There is the closet in 
which was reposited his threadbare suit of black! There is the worn-out 
shoe-brush with which this polished writer polished his boots. There 
is&quot;--but I believe this will be pretty much all, so here I close the 
catalogue. . . .</p> 
<p>A cloudy veil stretches over the abyss of my nature. I have, however, no 
love of secrecy and darkness. I am glad to think that God sees through my 
heart, and, if any angel has power to penetrate into it, he is welcome to know 
everything that is there. Yes, and so may any mortal who is capable of full 
sympathy,&nbsp;and therefore worthy to come into my depths. But he must find 
his own way there. I can neither guide nor enlighten him. It is this 
involuntary reserve, I suppose, that has given the objectivity to my writings; 
and when people think that I am pouring myself out in a tale or an essay, I am 
merely telling what is common to human nature, not what is peculiar to myself. 
I sympathize with them, not they with me. . . .</p> 
<p>I have recently been both lectured about and preached about here in my 
native city; the preacher was Rev. Mr. Fox, of Newburyport; but how he 
contrived to put me into a sermon I know not. I trust he took for his text, 
&quot;Behold an Israelite indeed, in whom there is no guile.&quot;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><em>Salem, March</em> 12<em>th.</em>--. . . That poor home! how desolate it 
is now! Last night, being awake, . . . my thoughts travelled back to the lonely 
old manse; and it seemed as if I were wandering up stairs and down stairs all 
by myself. My fancy was almost afraid to be there alone. I could see every 
object in a dim, gray light,--our chamber, the study, all in confusion; the 
parlor, with the fragments of that abortive breakfast on the table, and the 
precious silver forks, and the old bronze image, keeping its solitary stand 
upon the mantel-piece. Then, methought, the wretched Vigwiggie came, and jumped 
upon the window-sill, and clung there with her fore paws, mewing dismally for 
admittance, which I could not grant her, being there myself only in the spirit. 
And then came the ghost of the old Doctor, stalking through the gallery, and 
down the staircase, and peeping into the parlor; and though I was wide awake, 
and conscious of being so many miles from the spot, still it was quite awful to
&nbsp;think of the ghost having sole possession of our home; for I could not 
quite separate myself from it, after all. Somehow the Doctor and I seemed to be 
theret&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te . . . . I believe I did not have any 
fantasies about the ghostly kitchen-maid; but I trust Mary left the flat-irons 
within her reach, so that she may do all her ironing while we are away, and 
never disturb us more at midnight. I suppose she comes thither to iron her 
shroud, and perhaps, likewise, to smooth the Doctor's band. Probably, during 
her lifetime, she allowed him to go to some ordination or other grand clerical 
celebration with rumpled linen; and ever since, and throughout all earthly 
futurity (at least, as long as the house shall stand), she is doomed to 
exercise a nightly toil with a spiritual flat-iron. Poor sinner!--and doubtless 
Satan heats the irons for her. What nonsense is all this! but, really, it does 
make me shiver to think of that poor home of ours.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><em>March</em> 16<em>th.</em>--. . . As for this Mr. ----, I wish he would 
not be so troublesome. His scheme is well enough, and might possibly become 
popular; but it has no peculiar advantages with reference to myself, nor do the 
subjects of his proposed books particularly suit my fancy as themes to write 
upon. Somebody else will answer his purpose just as well; and I would rather 
write books of my own imagining than be hired to develop the ideas of an 
engraver; especially as the pecuniary prospect is not better, nor so good, as 
it might be elsewhere. I intend to adhere to my former plan of writing one or 
two mythological story-books, to be published under O'Sullivan's auspices in 
New York,--which is the only place where books can be published with a chance 
of profit. As a matter of&nbsp;courtesy, I may call on Mr. ---- if I have time; 
but I do not intend to be connected with this affair.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><em>Sunday, April</em> 9<em>th.</em>--. . . After finishing my record in 
the journal, I sat a long time in grandmother's chair, thinking of many things. 
. . . My spirits were at a lower ebb than they ever descend to when I am not 
alone; nevertheless, neither was I absolutely sad. Many times I wound and 
re-wound Mr. Thoreau's little musical-box; but certainly its peculiar sweetness 
had evaporated, and I am pretty sure that I should throw it out of the window 
were I doomed to hear it long and often. It has not an infinite soul. When it 
was almost as dark as the moonlight would let it be, I lighted the lamp, and 
went on with Tieck's tale, slowly and painfully, often wishing for help in my 
difficulties. At last I determined to learn a little about pronouns and verbs 
before proceeding further, and so took up the phrasebook, with which I was 
commendably busy, when, at about a quarter to nine, came a knock at my study 
door, and, behold, there was Molly with a letter! How she came by it I did not 
ask, being content to suppose it was brought by a heavenly messenger. I had not 
expected a letter; and what a comfort it was to me in my loneliness and 
sombreness! I called Molly to take her note (enclosed), which she received with 
a face of delight as broad and bright as the kitchen fire. Then I read, and 
re-read, and re-re-read, and quadruply, quintuply, and sextuply reread my 
epistle, until I had it all by heart, and then continued to re-read it for the 
sake of the penmanship. Then I took up the phrase-book again; but could not 
study, and so bathed and retired, it being now not far from ten o'clock. I lay 
awake a good deal in the night, but saw no ghost.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>I arose about seven, and found that the upper part of my nose, and the 
region round about, was grievously discolored; and at the angle of the left eye 
there is a great spot of almost black purple, and a broad streak of the same 
hue semicircling beneath either eye, while green, yellow, and orange overspread 
the circumjacent country. It looks not unlike a gorgeous sunset, throwing its 
splendor over the heaven of my countenance. It will behoove me to show myself 
as little as possible, else people will think I have fought a pitched battle, . 
. . The Devil take the stick of wood! What had I done, that it should bemaul me 
so? However, there is no pain, though, I think, a very slight affection of the 
eyes.</p> 
<p>This forenoon I began to write, and caught an idea by the skirts, which I 
intend to hold fast, though it struggles to get free. As it was not ready to be 
put upon paper, however, I took up the &quot;Dial,&quot; and finished reading 
the article on Mr. Alcott. It is not very satisfactory, and it has not taught 
me much. Then I read Margaret's article on Canova, which is good. About this 
time the dinner-bell rang, and I went down without much alacrity, though with a 
good appetite enough. . . . It was in the angle of my<em>right</em> eye, not my 
left, that the blackest purple was collected. But they both look like the very 
Devil.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Half past five o'clock.--After writing the above, . . . I again set to work 
on Tieck's tale, and worried through several pages; and then, at half past 
four, threw open one of the western windows of my study, and sallied forth to 
take the sunshine. I went down through the orchard to the river-side. The 
orchard-path is still deeply covered with snow; and so is the&nbsp;whole 
visible universe, except streaks upon the hill-sides, and spots in the sunny 
hollows, where the brown earth peeps through. The river, which a few days ago 
was entirely imprisoned, has now broken its fetters; but a tract of ice 
extended across from near the foot of the monument to the abutment of the old 
bridge, and looked so solid that I supposed it would yet remain for a day or 
two. Large cakes and masses of ice came floating down the current, which, 
though not very violent, hurried along at a much swifter pace than the ordinary 
one of our sluggish river-god. These ice-masses, when they struck the barrier 
of ice above mentioned, acted upon it like a battering-ram, and were themselves 
forced high out of the water, or sometimes carried beneath the main sheet of 
ice. At last, down the stream came an immense mass of ice, and, striking the 
barrier about at its centre, it gave way, and the whole was swept onward 
together, leaving the river entirely free, with only here and there a cake of 
ice floating quietly along. The great accumulation, in its downward course, hit 
against a tree that stood in mid-current, and caused it to quiver like a reed; 
and it swept quite over the shrubbery that bordered what, in summer-time, is 
the river's bank, but which is now nearly the centre of the stream. Our river 
in its present state has quite a noble breadth. The little hillock which formed 
the abutment of the old bridge is now an island with its tuft of trees. Along 
the hither shore a row of trees stand up to their knees, and the smaller ones 
to their middles, in the water; and afar off, on the surface of the stream, we 
see tufts of bushes emerging, thrusting up their heads, as it were, to breathe. 
The water comes over the stone-wall, and encroaches several yards on the 
boundaries of our&nbsp;orchard. [Here the supper-bell rang.] If our boat were 
in good order, I should now set forth on voyages of discovery, and visit nooks 
on the borders of the meadows, which by and by will be a mile or two from the 
water's edge. But she is in very bad condition, full of water, and, doubtless, 
as leaky as a sieve.</p> 
<p>On coming from supper, I found that little Puss had established herself in 
the study, probably with intent to pass the night here. She now lies on the 
foot-stool between my feet, purring most obstreperously. The day of my wife's 
departure, she came to me, talking with the greatest earnestness; but whether 
it was to condole with me on my loss, or to demand my redoubled care for 
herself, I could not well make out. As Puss now constitutes a third part of the 
family, this mention of her will not appear amiss. How Molly employs herself, I 
know not. Once in a while, I hear a door slam like a thunder-clap; but she 
never shows her face, nor speaks a word, unless to announce a visitor or 
deliver a letter. This day, on my part, will have been spent without exchanging 
a syllable with any human being, unless something unforeseen should yet call 
for the exercise of speech before bedtime.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><em>Monday, April</em> 10<em>th.</em>--I sat till eight o'clock, meditating 
upon this world and the next, . . . and sometimes dimly shaping out scenes of a 
tale. Then betook myself to the German phrase-book. Ah! these are but dreary 
evenings. The lamp would not brighten my spirits, though it was duly filled, . 
. . This forenoon was spent in scribbling, by no means to my satisfaction, 
until past eleven, when I went to the village. Nothing in our box at the 
post-office. I read during the customary hour, or more, at the&nbsp;
Athen&aelig;um, and returned without saying a word to mortal. I gathered from 
some conversation that I heard, that a son of Adam is to be buried this 
afternoon from the meeting-house; but the name of the deceased escaped me. It 
is no great matter, so it be but written in the Book of Life.</p> 
<p>My variegated face looks somewhat more human to-day; though I was 
unaffectedly ashamed to meet anybody's gaze, and therefore turned my back or my 
shoulder as much as possible upon the world. At dinner, behold an immense joint 
of roast veal! I would willingly have had some assistance in the discussion of 
this great piece of calf. I am ashamed to eat alone; it becomes the mere 
gratification of animal appetite,--the tribute which we are compelled to pay to 
our grosser nature; whereas, in the company of another it is refined and 
moralized and spiritualized; and over our earthly victuals (or rather<em>
vittles,</em> for the former is a very foolish mode of spelling),--over our 
earthly vittles is diffused a sauce of lofty and gentle thoughts, and tough 
meat is mollified with tender feelings. But oh! these solitary meals are the 
dismallest part of my present experience. When the company rose from table, 
they all, in my single person, ascended to the study, and employed themselves 
in reading the article on Oregon in the &quot;Democratic Review.&quot; Then 
they plodded onward in the rugged and bewildering depths of Tieck's tale until 
five o'clock, when, with one accord, they went out to split wood. This has been 
a gray day, with now and then a sprinkling of snow-flakes through the air. . . 
. To-day no more than yesterday have I spoken a word to mortal. . . . It is now 
sunset, and I must meditate till dark.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
<p><em>April</em> 11<em>th.</em>--I meditated accordingly, but without any 
very wonderful result. Then at eight o'clock bothered myself till after nine 
with this eternal tale of Tieck. The forenoon was spent in scribbling; but at 
eleven o'clock my thoughts ceased to flow,--indeed, their current has been 
wofully interrupted all along,--so I threw down my pen, and set out on the 
daily journey to the village. Horrible walking! I wasted the customary hour at 
the Athen&aelig;um, and returned home, if home it may now be called. Till 
dinner-time I labored on Tieck's tale, and resumed that agreeable employment 
after the banquet.</p> 
<p>Just when I was on the point of choking with a huge German word, Molly 
announced Mr. Thoreau. He wished to take a row in the boat, for the last time, 
perhaps, before he leaves Concord. So we emptied the water out of her, and set 
forth on our voyage. She leaks, but not more than she did in the autumn. We 
rowed to the foot of the hill which borders the North Branch, and there landed, 
and climbed the moist and snowy hill-side for the sake of the prospect. Looking 
down the river, it might well have been mistaken for an arm of the sea, so 
broad is now its swollen tide; and I could have fancied that, beyond one other 
headland, the mighty ocean would outspread itself before the eye. On our return 
we boarded a large cake of ice, which was floating down the river, and were 
borne by it directly to our own landing-place, with the boat towing behind.</p> 
<p>Parting with Mr. Thoreau, I spent half an hour in chopping wood, when Molly 
informed me that Mr. Emerson wished to see me. He had brought a letter of 
Ellery Channing, written in a style of very pleasant humor. This being read and 
discussed, together&nbsp;with a few other matters, he took his leave, since 
which I have been attending to my journalizing duty; and thus this record is 
brought down to the present moment.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><em>April</em> 25<em>th.</em> Spring is advancing, sometimes with sunny 
days, and sometimes, as is the case now, with chill, moist, sullen ones. There 
is an influence in the season that makes it almost impossible for me to bring 
my mind down to literary employment; perhaps because several months' pretty 
constant work has exhausted that species of energy,--perhaps because in spring 
it is more natural to labor actively than to think. But my impulse now is to be 
idle altogether,--to lie in the sun, or wander about and look at the revival of 
Nature from her death-like slumber, or to be borne down the current of the 
river in my boat. If I had wings, I would gladly fly; yet would prefer to be 
wafted along by a breeze, sometimes alighting on a patch of green grass, then 
gently whirled away to a still sunnier spot. . . . Oh, how blest should I be 
were there nothing to do! Then I would watch every inch and hair's-breadth of 
the progress of the season; and not a leaf should put itself forth, in the 
vicinity of our old mansion, without my noting it. But now, with the burden of 
a continual task upon me, I have not freedom of mind to make such observations. 
I merely see what is going on in a very general way. The snow, which, two or 
three weeks ago, covered hill and valley, is now diminished to one or two 
solitary specks in the visible landscape; though doubtless there are still 
heaps of it in the shady places in the woods. There have been no violent rains 
to carry it off: it has diminished gradually, inch by inch, and day after day;
&nbsp;and I observed, along the roadside, that the green blades of grass had 
sometimes sprouted on the very edge of the snowdrift the moment that the earth 
was uncovered.</p> 
<p>The pastures and grass-fields have not yet a general effect of green; nor 
have they that cheerless brown tint which they wear in later autumn, when 
vegetation has entirely ceased. There is now a suspicion of verdure,--the faint 
shadow of it,--but not the warm reality. Sometimes, in a happy exposure,--there 
is one such tract across the river, the carefully cultivated mowing-field, in 
front of an old red homestead,--such patches of land wear a beautiful and 
tender green, which no other season will equal; because, let the grass be green 
as it may hereafter, it will not be so set off by surrounding barrenness. The 
trees in our orchard, and elsewhere, have as yet no leaves; yet to the most 
careless eye they appear full of life and vegetable blood. It seems as if, by 
one magic touch, they might instantaneously put forth all their foliage, and 
the wind, which now sighs through their naked branches, might all at once find 
itself impeded by innumerable leaves. This sudden development would be scarcely 
more wonderful than the gleam of verdure which often brightens, in a moment, as 
it were, along the slope of a bank or roadside. It is like a gleam of sunlight. 
Just now it was brown, like the rest of the scenery: look again, and there is 
an apparition of green grass. The Spring, no doubt, comes onward with fleeter 
footsteps, because Winter has lingered so long that, at best, she can hardly 
retrieve half the allotted term of her reign.</p> 
<p>The river, this season, has encroached farther on the land than it has been 
known to do for twenty&nbsp;years past. It has formed along its course a 
succession of lakes, with a current through the midst. My boat has lain at the 
bottom of the orchard, in very convenient proximity to the house. It has borne 
me over stone fences; and, a few days ago, Ellery Channing and I passed through 
two rails into the great northern road, along which we paddled for some 
distance. The trees have a singular appearance in the midst of waters. The 
curtailment of their trunks quite destroys the proportions of the whole tree; 
and we become conscious of a regularity and propriety in the forms of Nature, 
by the effect of this abbreviation. The waters are now subsiding, but 
gradually. Islands become annexed to the mainland, and other islands emerge 
from the flood, and will soon, likewise, be connected with the continent. We 
have seen on a small scale the process of the deluge, and can now witness that 
of the reappearance of the earth.</p> 
<p>Crows visited us long before the snow was off. They seem mostly to have 
departed now, or else to have betaken themselves to remote depths of the woods, 
which they haunt all summer long. Ducks came in great numbers, and many 
sportsmen went in pursuit of them along the river; but they also have 
disappeared. Gulls come up from seaward, and soar high overhead, flapping their 
broad wings in the upper sunshine. They are among the most picturesque birds 
that I am acquainted with; indeed, quite the most so, because the manner of 
their flight makes them almost stationary parts of the landscape. The 
imagination has time to rest upon them; they have not flitted away in a moment. 
You go up among the clouds, and lay hold of these soaring gulls, and repose 
with them upon the sustaining atmosphere. The smaller birds,&nbsp;--the birds 
that build their nests in our trees, and sing for us at morning-red,--I will 
not describe.. . But I must mention the great companies of blackbirds--more 
than the famous &quot;four-and-twenty&quot; who were baked in a pie--that 
congregate on the tops of contiguous trees, and vociferate with all the clamor 
of a turbulent political meeting. Politics must certainly be the subject of 
such a tumultuous debate; but still there is a melody in each individual 
utterance, and a harmony in the general effect. Mr. Thoreau tells me that these 
noisy assemblages consist of three different species of blackbirds; but I 
forget the other two. Robins have been long among us, and swallows have more 
recently arrived.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><em>April</em> 26<em>th.</em>--Here is another misty day, muffling the sun. 
The lilac-shrubs under my study window are almost in leaf. In two or three days 
more, I may put forth my hand and pluck a green bough. These lilacs appear to 
be very aged, and have lost the luxuriant foliage of their prime. Old age has a 
singular aspect in lilacs, rose-bushes, and other ornamental shrubs. It seems 
as if such things, as they grow only for beauty, ought to flourish in immortal 
youth, or at least to die before their decrepitude. They are trees of Paradise, 
and therefore not naturally subject to decay; but have lost their birthright by 
being transplanted hither. There is a kind of ludicrous unfitness in the idea 
of a venerable rose-bush; and there is something analogous to this in human 
life. Persons who can only be graceful and ornamental--who can give the world 
nothing but flowers--should die young, and never be seen with gray hairs and 
wrinkles, any more than the flower-shrubs with mossy bark and scanty&nbsp;
foliage, like the lilacs under my window. Not that beauty is not worthy of 
immortality. Nothing else, indeed, is worthy of it; and thence, perhaps, the 
sense of impropriety when we see it triumphed over by time. Apple-trees, on the 
other hand, grow old without reproach. Let them live as long as they may, and 
contort themselves in whatever fashion they please, they are still respectable, 
even if they afford us only an apple or two in a season, or none at all. Human 
flower-shrubs, if they will grow old on earth, should, beside their lovely 
blossoms, bear some kind of fruit that will satisfy earthly appetites; else men 
will not be satisfied that the moss should gather on them.</p> 
<p>Winter and Spring are now struggling for the mastery in my study; and I 
yield somewhat to each, and wholly to neither. The window is open, and there is 
a fire in the stove. The day when the window is first thrown open should be an 
epoch in the year; but I have forgotten to record it. Seventy or eighty springs 
have visited this old house; and sixty of them found old Dr. Ripley here,--not 
always old, it is true, but gradually getting wrinkles and gray hairs, and 
looking more and more the picture of winter. But he was no flower-shrub, but 
one of those fruit-trees or timber-trees that acquire a grace with their old 
age. Last Spring found this house solitary for the first time since it was 
built; and now again she peeps into our open windows and finds new faces here. 
. . .</p> 
<p>It is remarkable how much uncleanness winter brings with it, or leaves 
behind it, . . . The yard, garden, and avenue, which should be my department, 
require a great amount of labor. The avenue is strewed with withered 
leaves,--the whole crop, apparently, of last year,--some of which are now raked 
into heaps;&nbsp;and we intend to make a bonfire of them. . . --There are 
quantities of decayed branches, which one tempest after another has flung down, 
black and rotten. In the garden are the old cabbages which we did not think 
worth gathering last autumn, and the dry bean-vines, and the withered stalks of 
the asparagus-bed; in short, all the wrecks of the departed year,--its 
mouldering relics, its dry bones. It is a pity that the world cannot be made 
over anew every spring. Then, in the yard, there are the piles of firewood, 
which I ought to have sawed and thrown into the shed long since, but which will 
cumber the earth, I fear, till June, at least. Quantities of chips are strewn 
about, and on removing them we find the yellow stalks of grass sprouting 
underneath. Nature does her best to beautify this disarray. The grass springs 
up most industriously, especially in sheltered and sunny angles of the 
buildings, or round the doorsteps,--a locality which seems particularly 
favorable to its growth; for it is already high enough to bend over and wave 
the wind. I was surprised to observe that some weeds (especially a plant that 
stains the fingers with its yellow juice) had lived, and retained their 
freshness and sap as perfectly as in summer, through all the frosts and snows 
of last winter. I saw them, the last green thing, in the autumn; and here they 
are again, the first in the spring.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><em>Thursday, April</em> 27<em>th.</em>--I took a walk into the fields, and 
round our opposite hill, yesterday noon, but made no very remarkable 
observation. The frogs have begun their concerts, though not as yet with a full 
choir. I found no violets nor anemones, nor anything in the likeness of a 
flower, though I looked carefully&nbsp;along the shelter of the stone-walls, 
and in all spots apparently propitious. I ascended the hill, and had a wide 
prospect of a swollen river, extending around me in a semicircle of three or 
four miles, and rendering the view much finer than in summer, had there only 
been foliage. It seemed like the formation of a new world; for islands were 
everywhere emerging, and capes extending forth into the flood; and these 
tracts, which were thus won from the watery empire, were among the greenest in 
the landscape. The moment the deluge leaves them Nature asserts them to be her 
property by covering them with verdure; or perhaps the grass had been growing 
under the water. On the hill-top where I stood, the grass had scarcely begun to 
sprout; and I observed that even those places which looked greenest in the 
distance were but scantily grass-covered when I actually reached them. It was 
hope that painted them so bright.</p> 
<p>Last evening we saw a bright light on the river, betokening that a boat's 
party were engaged in spearing fish. It looked like a descended star,--like red 
Mars,--and, as the water was perfectly smooth, its gleam was reflected downward 
into the depths. It is a very picturesque sight. In the deep quiet of the night 
I suddenly heard the light and lively note of a bird from a neighboring 
tree,--a real song, such as those which greet the purple dawn, or mingle with 
the yellow sunshine. What could the little bird mean by pouring it forth at 
midnight? Probably the note gushed out from the midst of a dream, in which he 
fancied himself in Paradise with his mate; and, suddenly awakening, he found he 
was on a cold, leafless bough, with a New England mist penetrating through his 
feathers. That was a sad exchange of imagination&nbsp;for reality; but if he 
found his mate beside him, all was well.</p> 
<p>This is another misty morning, ungenial in aspect, but kinder than it 
looks; for it paints the hills and valleys with a richer brush than the 
sunshine could. There is more verdure now than when I looked out of the window 
an hour ago. The willow-tree opposite my study window is ready to put forth its 
leaves. There are some objections to willows. It is not a dry and cleanly tree; 
it impresses me with an association of sliminess; and no trees, I think, are 
perfectly satisfactory, which have not a firm and hard texture of trunk and 
branches. But the willow is almost the earliest to put forth its leaves, and 
the last to scatter them on the ground; and during the whole winter its yellow 
twigs give it a sunny aspect, which is not without a cheering influence in a 
proper point of view. Our old house would lose much were this willow to be cut 
down, with its golden crown over the roof in winter, and its heap of summer 
verdure. The present Mr. Ripley planted it, fifty years ago, or thereabouts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><em>Friday, June</em> 2<em>d.</em>--Last night there came a frost, which 
has done great damage to my garden. The beans have suffered very much, 
although, luckily, not more than half that I planted have come up. The 
squashes, both summer and winter, appear to be almost killed. As to the other 
vegetables, there is little mischief done,--the potatoes not being yet above 
ground, except two or three; and the peas and corn are of a hardier nature. It 
is sad that Nature will so sport with us poor mortals, inviting us with sunny 
smiles to confide in her; and then, when we are entirely in her power, striking 
us to the heart. Our summer&nbsp;commences at the latter end of June, and 
terminates somewhere about the first of August. There are certainly not more 
than six weeks of the whole year when a frost may be deemed anything remarkable.
</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><em>Friday, June</em> 23<em>d.</em>--Summer has come at last,--the longest 
days, with blazing sunshine, and fervid heat. Yesterday glowed like molten 
brass. Last night was the most uncomfortably and unsleepably sultry that we 
have experienced since our residence in Concord; and to-day it scorches again. 
I have a sort of enjoyment in these seven-times-heated furnaces of midsummer, 
even though they make me droop like a thirsty plant. The sunshine can scarcely 
be too burning for my taste; but I am no enemy to summer showers. Could I only 
have the freedom to be perfectly idle now,--no duty to fulfil, no mental or 
physical labor to perform,--I should be as happy as a squash, and much in the 
same mode; but the necessity of keeping my brain at work eats into my comfort, 
as the squash-bugs do into the heart of the vines. I keep myself uneasy and 
produce little, and almost nothing that is worth producing.</p> 
<p>The garden looks well now: the potatoes flourish; the early corn waves in 
the wind; the squashes, both for summer and winter use, are more forward, I 
suspect, than those of any of my neighbors. I am forced, however, to carry on a 
continual warfare with the squash-bugs, who, were I to let them alone for a 
day, would perhaps quite destroy the prospects of the whole summer. It is 
impossible not to feel angry with these unconscionable insects, who scruple not 
to do such excessive mischief to me, with only the profit of a meal or two to 
themselves. For their own sakes they ought&nbsp;at least to wait till the 
squashes are better grown. Why is it, I wonder, that Nature has provided such a 
host of enemies for every useful esculent, while the weeds are suffered to grow 
unmolested, and are provided with such tenacity of life, and such methods of 
propagation, that the gardener must maintain a continual struggle or they will 
hopelessly overwhelm him? What hidden virtue is in these things, that it is 
granted them to sow themselves with the wind, and to grapple the earth with 
this immitigable stubbornness, and to flourish in spite of obstacles, and never 
to suffer blight beneath any sun or shade, but always to mock their enemies 
with the same wicked luxuriance? It is truly a mystery, and also a symbol. 
There is a sort of sacredness about them. Perhaps, if we could penetrate 
Nature's secrets, we should find that what we call weeds are more essential to 
the well-being of the world than the most precious fruit or grain. This may be 
doubted, however, for there is an unmistakable analogy between these wicked 
weeds and the bad habits and sinful propensities which have overrun the moral 
world; and we may as well imagine that there is good in one as in the other.</p>
<p>Our peas are in such forwardness that I should not wonder if we had some of 
them on the table within a week. The beans have come up ill, and I planted a 
fresh supply only the day before yesterday. We have watermelons in good 
advancement, and muskmelons also within three or four days. I set out some 
tomatoes last night, also some capers. It is my purpose to plant some more corn 
at the end of the month, or sooner. There ought to be a record of the 
flower-garden, and of the procession of the wild-flowers, as minute, at least, 
as of the kitchen vegetables and&nbsp;pot-herbs. Above all, the noting of the 
appearance of the first roses should not be omitted; nor of the Arethusa, one 
of the delicatest, gracefullest, and in every manner sweetest, of the whole 
race of flowers. For a fortnight past I have found it in the swampy meadows, 
growing up to its chin in heaps of wet moss. Its hue is a delicate pink, of 
various depths of shade, and somewhat in the form of a Grecian helmet. To 
describe it is a feat beyond my power. Also the visit of two friends, who may 
fitly enough be mentioned among flowers, ought to have been described. Mrs. F. 
S---- and Miss A. S----. Also I have neglected to mention the birth of a little 
white dove.</p> 
<p>I never observed, until the present season, how long and late the twilight 
lingers in these longest days. The orange hue of the western horizon remains 
till ten o'clock, at least, and how much later I am unable to say. The night 
before last, I could distinguish letters by this lingering gleam between nine 
and ten o'clock. The dawn, I suppose, shows itself as early as two o'clock, so 
that the absolute dominion of night has dwindled to almost nothing. There seems 
to be also a diminished necessity, or, at all events, a much less possibility, 
of sleep than at other periods of the year. I get scarcely any sound repose 
just now. It is summer, and not winter, that steals away mortal life. Well, we 
get the value of what is taken from us.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><em>Saturday, July</em> 1<em>st.</em>--We had our first dish of green peas 
(a very small one) yesterday. Every day for the last week has been tremendously 
hot; and our garden flourishes like Eden itself, only Adam could hardly have 
been doomed to contend with such a ferocious banditti of weeds.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
<p><em>Sunday, July</em> 9<em>th.</em>--I know not what to say, and yet cannot 
be satisfied without marking with a word or two this anniversary, . . . But 
life now swells and heaves beneath me like a brim-full ocean; and the endeavor 
to comprise any portion of it in words is like trying to dip up the ocean in a 
goblet. . . . God bless and keep us! for there is something more awful in 
happiness than in sorrow,--the latter being earthly and finite, the former 
composed of the substance and texture of eternity, so that spirits still 
embodied may well tremble at it.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><em>July</em> 18<em>th.</em>--This morning I gathered our first 
summer-squashes. We should have had them some days earlier, but for the loss of 
two of the vines, either by a disease of the roots or by those infernal bugs. 
We have had turnips and carrots several times. Currants are now ripe, and we 
are in the full enjoyment of cherries, which turn out much more delectable than 
I anticipated. George Hillard and Mrs. Hillard paid us a visit on Saturday 
last. On Monday afternoon he left us, and Mrs. Hillard still remains here.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><em>Friday, July</em> 28<em>th.</em>--We had green corn for dinner 
yesterday, and shall have some more to-day, not quite full grown, but 
sufficiently so to be palatable. There has been no rain, except one moderate 
shower, for many weeks; and the earth appears to be wasting away in a slow 
fever. This weather, I think, affects the spirits very unfavorably. There is an 
irksomeness, a restlessness, a pervading dissatisfaction, together with an 
absolute incapacity to bend the mind to any serious effort. With me, as regards 
literary production, the summer has been unprofitable; and I&nbsp;only hope 
that my forces are recruiting themselves for the autumn and winter. For the 
future, I shall endeavor to be so diligent nine months of the year that I may 
allow myself a full and free vacation of the other three.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><em>Monday, July</em> 31<em>st.</em>--We had our first cucumber yesterday. 
There were symptoms of rain on Saturday, and the weather has since been as 
moist as the thirstiest soul could desire.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><em>Wednesday, September</em> 13<em>th.</em>--There was a frost the night 
before last, according to George Prescott; but no effects of it were visible in 
our garden. Last night, however, there was another, which has nipped the leaves 
of the winter-squashes and cucumbers, but seems to have done no other damage. 
This is a beautiful morning, and promises to be one of those heavenly days that 
render autumn, after all, the most delightful season of the year. We mean to 
make a voyage on the river this afternoon.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><em>Sunday, September</em> 23<em>d.</em>--I have gathered the two last of 
our summer-squashes to-day. They have lasted ever since the 18th of July, and 
have numbered fifty-eight edible ones, of excellent quality. Last Wednesday, I 
think, I harvested our winter-squashes, sixty-three in number, and mostly of 
fine size. Our last series of green corn, planted about the 1st of July, was 
good for eating two or three days ago. We still have beans; and our tomatoes, 
though backward, supply us with a dish every day or two. My potato-crop 
promises well; and, on the whole, my first independent experiment of 
agriculture is quite a successful one.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>This is a glorious day,--bright, very warm, yet with an unspeakable 
gentleness both in its warmth and brightness. On such days it is impossible not 
to love Nature, for she evidently loves us. At other seasons she does not give 
me this impression, or only at very rare intervals; but in these happy, 
autumnal days, when she has perfected the harvests, and accomplished every 
necessary thing that she had to do, she overflows with a blessed superfluity of 
love. It is good to be alive now. Thank God for breath,--yes, for mere breath! 
when it is made up of such a heavenly breeze as this. It comes to the cheek 
with a real kiss; it would linger fondly around us, if it might; but, since it 
must be gone, it caresses us with its whole kindly heart, and passes onward, to 
caress likewise the next thing that it meets. There is a pervading blessing 
diffused over all the world. I look out of the window and think, &quot;O 
perfect day! O beautiful world! O good God!&quot; And such a day is the promise 
of a blissful eternity. Our Creator would never have made such weather, and 
given us the deep heart to enjoy it, above and beyond all thought, if he had 
not meant us to be immortal. It opens the gates of heaven and gives us glimpses 
far inward.</p> 
<p>Bless me! this flight has carried me a great way; so now let me come back 
to our old abbey. Our orchard is fast ripening; and the apples and great 
thumping pears strew the grass in such abundance that it becomes almost a 
trouble--though a pleasant one--to gather them. This happy breeze, too, shakes 
them down, as if it flung fruit to us out of the sky; and often, when the air 
is perfectly still, I hear the quiet fall of a great apple. Well, we are rich 
in blessings, though poor in money. . . .</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><em>Friday, October</em> 6<em>th.</em>--Yesterday afternoon I took a 
solitary walk to Walden Pond. It was a cool, windy day, with heavy clouds 
rolling and tumbling about the sky, but still a prevalence of genial autumn 
sunshine. The fields are still green, and the great masses of the woods have 
not yet assumed their many-colored garments; but here and there are solitary 
oaks of deep, substantial red, or maples of a more brilliant hue, or chestnuts 
either yellow or of a tenderer green than in summer. Some trees seem to return 
to their hue of May or early June before they put on the brighter autumnal 
tints. In some places, along the borders of low and moist land, a whole range 
of trees were clothed in the perfect gorgeousness of autumn, of all shades of 
brilliant color, looking like the palette on which Nature was arranging the 
tints wherewith to paint a picture. These hues appeared to be thrown together 
without design; and yet there was perfect harmony among them, and a softness 
and a delicacy made up of a thousand different brightnesses. There is not, I 
think, so much contrast among these colors as might at first appear. The more 
you consider them, the more they seem to have one element among them all, which 
is the reason that the most brilliant display of them soothes the observer, 
instead of exciting him. And I know not whether it be more a moral effect or a 
physical one, operating merely on the eye; but it is a pensive gayety, which 
causes a sigh often, and never a smile. We never fancy, for instance, that 
these gayly clad trees might be changed into young damsels in holiday attire, 
and betake themselves to dancing on the plain. If they were to undergo such a 
transformation, they would surely arrange themselves in funeral procession, and 
go sadly along, with their purple and&nbsp;scarlet and golden garments trailing 
over the withering grass. When the sunshine falls upon them, they seem to 
smile; but it is as if they were heartbroken. But it is in vain for me to 
attempt to describe these autumnal brilliancies, or to convey the impression 
which they make on me. I have tried a thousand times, and always without the 
slightest self-satisfaction. Fortunately there is no need of such a record, for 
Nature renews the picture year after year; and even when we shall have passed 
away from the world, we can spiritually create these scenes, so that we may 
dispense with all efforts to put them into words.</p> 
<p>Walden Pond was clear and beautiful as usual. It tempted me to bathe; and, 
though the water was thrillingly cold, it was like the thrill of a happy death. 
Never was there such transparent water as this. I threw sticks into it, and saw 
them float suspended on an almost invisible medium. It seemed as if the pure 
air were beneath them, as well as above. It is fit for baptisms; but one would 
not wish it to be polluted by having sins washed into it. None but angels 
should bathe in it; but blessed babies might be dipped into its bosom.</p> 
<p>In a small and secluded dell that opens upon the most beautiful cove of the 
whole lake, there is a little hamlet of huts or shanties inhabited by the Irish 
people who are at work upon the railroad. There are three or four of these 
habitations, the very rudest, I should imagine, that civilized men ever made 
for themselves,--constructed of rough boards, with the protruding ends. Against 
some of them the earth is heaped up to the roof, or nearly so; and when the 
grass has had time to sprout upon them, they will look like small natural 
hillocks, or a species of ant-hills,--something&nbsp;in which Nature has a 
larger share than man. These huts are placed beneath the trees, oaks, walnuts, 
and white-pines, wherever the trunks give them space to stand; and by thus 
adapting themselves to natural interstices, instead of making new ones, they do 
not break or disturb the solitude and seclusion of the place. Voices are heard, 
and the shouts and laughter of children, who play about like the sunbeams that 
come down through the branches. Women are washing in open spaces, and long 
lines of whitened clothes are extended from tree to tree, fluttering and 
gambolling in the breeze. A pig, in a sty even more extemporary than the 
shanties, is grunting and poking his snout through the clefts of his 
habitation. The household pots and kettles are seen at the doors; and a glance 
within shows the rough benches that serve for chairs, and the bed upon the 
floor. The visitor's nose takes note of the fragrance of a pipe. And yet, with 
all these homely items, the repose and sanctity of the old wood do not seem to 
be destroyed or profaned. It overshadows these poor people, and assimilates 
them somehow or other to the character of its natural inhabitants. Their 
presence did not shock me any more than if I had merely discovered a squirrel's 
nest in a tree. To be sure, it is a torment to see the great, high, ugly 
embankment of the railroad, which is here thrusting itself into the lake, or 
along its margin, in close vicinity to this picturesque little hamlet. I have 
seldom seen anything more beautiful than the cove on the border of which the 
huts are situated; and the more I looked, the lovelier it grew. The trees 
overshadowed it deeply; but on one side there was some brilliant shrubbery 
which seemed to light up the whole picture with the effect of a sweet and 
melancholy smile.&nbsp;I felt as if spirits were there,--or as if these shrubs 
had a spiritual life. In short, the impression was indefinable; and, after 
gazing and musing a good while, I retraced my steps through the Irish hamlet, 
and plodded on along a wood-path.</p> 
<p>According to my invariable custom, I mistook my way, and, emerging upon the 
road, I turned my back instead of my face towards Concord, and walked on very 
diligently till a guide-board informed me of my mistake. I then turned about, 
and was shortly overtaken by an old yeoman in a chaise, who kindly offered me a 
drive, and soon set me down in the village.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>EXTRACTS FROM LETTERS.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<h3>[1844]</h3> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><em>Salem, April</em> 14<em>th,</em> 1844.--. . . I went to George 
Hillard's office, and he spoke with immitigable resolution of the necessity of 
my going to dine with Longfellow before returning to Concord; but I have an 
almost miraculous power of escaping from necessities of this kind. Destiny 
itself has often been worsted in the attempt to get me out to dinner. Possibly, 
however, I may go. Afterwards, I called on Colonel Hall, who held me long in 
talk about polities and other sweetmeats. Then I stepped into a book auction, 
not to buy, but merely to observe, and, after a few moments, who should come 
in, with a smile as sweet as sugar (though savoring rather of molasses), but, 
to my horror and petrifaction, ----! I anticipated a great deal of bore and 
botheration; but, through Heaven's mercy, he merely spoke a few words, and left 
me. This is so unlike his deportment in times past, that I suspect &quot;The 
Celestial Railroad&quot; must have given him a pique; and, if so, I shall feel 
as if Providence had sufficiently rewarded me for that pious labor&nbsp;.</p> 
<p>In the course of the forenoon I encountered Mr. Howes in the street. He 
looked most exceedingly depressed, and, pressing my hand with peculiar 
emphasis, said that he was in great affliction, having just heard of his son 
George's death in Cuba. He seemed encompassed and overwhelmed by this 
misfortune, and walks the street as in a heavy cloud of his own grief, forth 
from which he extended his hand to meet my grasp. I expressed my sympathy, 
which I told him I was now the more capable of feeling in a father's suffering, 
as being myself the father of a little girl,--and, indeed, the being a parent 
does give one the freedom of a wider range of sorrow as well as of happiness. 
He again pressed my hand, and left me. . . .</p> 
<p>When I got to Salem, there was great joy, as you may suppose. . . . Mother 
hinted an apprehension that poor baby would be spoilt, whereupon I irreverently 
observed that, having spoiled her own three children, it was natural for her to 
suppose that all other parents would do the same; when she averred that it was 
impossible to spoil such children as E---- and I, because she had never been 
able to do anything with us. . . . I could hardly convince them that Una had 
begun to smile so soon. It surprised my mother, though her own children appear 
to have been bright specimens of babyhood. E---- could walk and talk at nine 
months old. I do not understand that I was quite such a miracle of precocity, 
but should think it not impossible, inasmuch as precocious boys are said to 
make stupid men.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><em>May</em> 27<em>th,</em> 1844.--. . . My cook fills his office 
admirably. He prepared what I must acknowledge&nbsp;to be the best dish of 
fried fish and potatoes for dinner to-day that I ever tasted in this house. I 
scarcely recognized the fish of our own river. I make him get all the dinners, 
while I confine myself to the much lighter task of breakfast and tea. He also 
takes his turn in washing the dishes.</p> 
<p>We had a very pleasant dinner at Longfellow's, and I liked Mrs. Longfellow 
very much. The dinner was late and we sat long; so that C---- and I did not get 
to Concord till half past nine o'clock, and truly the old manse seemed somewhat 
dark and desolate. The next morning George Prescott came with Una's Lion, who 
greeted me very affectionately, but whined and moaned as if he missed somebody 
who should have been here. I am not quite so strict as I should be in keeping 
him out of the house; but I commiserate him and myself, for are we not both of 
us bereaved? C----, whom I can no more keep from smoking than I could the 
kitchen chimney, has just come into the study with a cigar, which might perfume 
this letter and make you think it came from my own enormity, so I may as well 
stop here.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><em>May</em> 29<em>th.</em>--C---- is leaving me, to my unspeakable relief; 
for he has had a bad cold, which caused him to be much more troublesome and 
less amusing than might otherwise have been the case.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><em>May</em> 31<em>st.</em>--. . . I get along admirably, and am at this 
moment superintending the corned beef, which has been on the fire, as it 
appears to me, ever since the beginning of time, and shows no symptom of being 
done before the crack of doom. Mrs. Hale says it must boil till it becomes 
tender; and so it shall, if I can find wood to keep the fire a-going.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Meantime, I keep my station in the dining-room, and read or write as 
composedly as in my own study. Just now, there came a very important rap at the 
front door, and I threw down a smoked herring which I had begun to eat, as 
there is no hope of the corned beef to-day, and went to admit the visitor. Who 
should it be but Ben B----, with a very peculiar and mysterious grin upon his 
face! He put into my hand a missive directed to &quot;Mr. and Mrs. 
Hawthorne.&quot; It contained a little bit of card, signifying that Dr. L. 
F---- and Miss C. B---- receive their friends Thursday eve, June 6. I am afraid 
I shall be too busy washing my dishes to pay many visits. The washing of dishes 
does seem to me the most absurd and unsatisfactory business that I ever 
undertook. If, when once washed, they would remain clean forever and ever 
(which they ought in all reason to do, considering how much trouble it is), 
there would be less occasion to grumble; but no sooner is it done, than it 
requires to be done again. On the whole, I have come to the resolution not to 
use more than one dish at each meal. However, I moralize deeply on this and 
other matters, and have discovered that all the trouble and affliction in the 
world come from the necessity of cleansing away our earthly stains.</p> 
<p>I ate the last morsel of bread yesterday, and congratulate myself on being 
now reduced to the fag-end of necessity. Nothing worse can happen, according to 
ordinary modes of thinking, than to want bread; but like most afflictions, it 
is more in prospect than reality. I found one cracker in the tureen, and 
exulted over it as if it had been so much gold. However, I have sent a petition 
to Mrs. P---- stating my destitute condition, and imploring her succor; and, 
till it arrive, I&nbsp;shall keep myself alive on herrings and apples, together 
with part of a pint of milk, which I share with Leo. He is my great trouble 
now, though an excellent companion too. But it is not easy to find food for 
him, unless I give him what is fit for Christians,--though, for that matter, he 
appears to be as good a Christian as most laymen, or even as some of the 
clergy. I fried some pouts and eels yesterday, on purpose for him, for he does 
not like raw fish. They were very good, but I should hardly have taken the 
trouble on my own account.</p> 
<p>George P---- has just come to say that Mrs. P---- has no bread at present, 
and is gone away this afternoon, but that she will send me some to-morrow. I 
mean to have a regular supply from the same source. . . . You cannot imagine 
how much the presence of Leo relieves the feeling of perfect loneliness. He 
insists upon being in the room with me all the time, except at night, when he 
sleeps in the shed, and I do not find myself severe enough to drive him out. He 
accompanies me likewise in all my walks to the village and elsewhere; and, in 
short, keeps at my heels, all the time, except when I go down cellar. Then he 
stands at the head of the stairs and howls, as if he never expected to see me 
again. He is evidently impressed with the present solitude of our old abbey, 
both on his own account and mine, and feels that he may assume a greater degree 
of intimacy than would be otherwise allowable. He will be easily brought within 
the old regulations after your return. P.S. 3 o'clock.--The beef is done!!!</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><em>Concord. The Old Manse. June</em> 2<em>d.</em>--. . . Everything goes 
on well with me. At the time of&nbsp;writing my last letter, I was without 
bread. Well, just at supper-time came Mrs. B---- with a large covered dish, 
which proved to contain a quantity of specially good flapjacks, piping hot, 
prepared, I suppose, by the fair hands of Miss Martha or Miss Abby, for Mrs. 
P---- was not at home. They served me both for supper and breakfast; and I 
thanked Providence and the young ladies, and compared myself to the prophet fed 
by ravens,--though the simile does rather more than justice to myself, and not 
enough to the generous donors of the flapjacks. The next morning, Mrs. P---- 
herself brought two big loaves of bread, which will last me a week, unless I 
have some guests to provide for. I have likewise found a hoard of crackers in 
one of the covered dishes; so that the old castle is sufficiently provisioned 
to stand a long siege. The corned beef is exquisitely done, and as tender as a 
young lady's heart, all owing to my skilful cookery; for I consulted Mrs. Hale 
at every step, and precisely followed her directions. To say the truth, I look 
upon it as such a masterpiece in its way, that it seems irreverential to eat 
it. Things on which so much thought and labor are bestowed should surely be 
immortal. . . . Leo and I attended divine services this morning in a temple not 
made with hands. We went to the farthest extremity of Peter's path, and there 
lay together under an oak, on the verge of the broad meadow.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><em>Concord, June</em> 6<em>th.</em>--. . . Mr. F---- arrived yesterday, 
and appeared to be in most excellent health, and as happy as the sunshine. 
About the first thing he did was to wash the dishes; and he is really 
indefatigable in the kitchen, so that I am quite a&nbsp;gentleman of leisure. 
Previous to his arrival, I had kindled no fire for four entire days, and had 
lived all that time on the corned beef, except one day, when Ellery and I went 
down the river on a fishing excursion. Yesterday, we boiled some lamb, which we 
shall have cold for dinner to-day. This morning, Mr. F---- fried a sumptuous 
dish of eels for breakfast. Mrs. P. ---- continues to be the instrument of 
Providence, and yesterday sent us a very nice plum-pudding.</p> 
<p>I have told Mr. F---- that I shall be engaged in the forenoons, and he is 
to manage his own occupations and amusements during that time, . . .</p> 
<p>Leo, I regret to say, has fallen under suspicion of a very great 
crime,--nothing less than murder,--a fowl crime it may well be called, for it 
is the slaughter of one of Mr. Hayward's hens. He has been seen to chase the 
hens, several times, and the other day one of them was found dead. Possibly he 
may be innocent, and, as there is nothing but circumstantial evidence, it must 
be left with his own conscience.</p> 
<p>Meantime, Mr. Hayward, or somebody else, seems to have given him such a 
whipping that he is absolutely stiff, and walks about like a rheumatic old 
gentleman. I am afraid, too, that he is an incorrigible thief. Ellery says he 
has seen him coming up the avenue with a calf's whole head in his mouth. How he 
came by it is best known to Leo himself. If he were a dog of fair character, it 
would be no more than charity to conclude that he had either bought it, or had 
it given to him; but with the other charges against him, it inclines me to 
great distrust of his moral principles. Be that as it may, he managed his stock 
of provisions very thriftily, burying it in the earth, and eating a portion of 
it whenever he felt an&nbsp;appetite. If he insists upon living by highway 
robbery, it would be well to make him share his booty with us. . . .</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><em>June</em> 10<em>th.</em>--. . . Mr. F---- is in perfect health, and 
absolutely in the seventh heaven, and he talks and talks and tails and talks; 
and I listen and listen and listen with a patience for which, in spite of all 
my sins, I firmly expect to be admitted to the mansions of the blessed. And 
there is really a contentment in being able to make this poor, world-worn, 
hopeless, half-crazy man so entirely comfortable as he seems to be here. He is 
an admirable cook. We had some roast veal and a baked rice-pudding on Sunday, 
really a fine dinner, and cooked in better style than Mary can equal; and 
George Curtis came to dine with us. Like all male cooks, he is rather 
expensive, and has a tendency to the consumption of eggs in his various 
concoctions, . . . I have had my dreams of splendor; but never expected to 
arrive at the dignity of keeping a man-cook. At first we had three meals a day, 
but now only two. . . .</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>We dined at Mr. Emerson's the other day, in company with Mr. Hedge. Mr. 
Bradford has been to see us two or three times, . . . He looks thinner than 
ever.</p>

<h3>[1850]</h3> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>PASSAGES FROM NOTE-BOOKS.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><em>May</em> 5<em>th,</em> 1850.--I left Portsmouth last Wednesday, at the 
quarter past twelve, by the Concord Rail-road, which at Newcastle unites with 
the Boston and Maine Railroad about ten miles from Portsmouth. The station at 
Newcastle is a small wooden building,&nbsp;with one railroad passing on one 
side, and another on another, and the two crossing each other at right angles. 
At a little distance stands a black, large, old, wooden church, with a square 
tower, and broken windows, and a great rift though the middle of the roof, all 
in a stage of dismal ruin and decay. A farm-house of the old style, with a long 
sloping roof, and as black as the church, stands on the opposite side of the 
road, with its barns; and these are all the buildings in sight of the railroad 
station. On the Concord rail is the train of cars, with the locomotive puffing, 
and blowing off its steam, and making a great bluster in that lonely place, 
while along the other railroad stretches the desolate track, with the withered 
weeds growing up betwixt the two lines of iron, all so desolate. And anon you 
hear a low thunder running along these iron rails; it grows louder; an object 
is seen afar off; it approaches rapidly, and comes down upon you like fate, 
swift and inevitable. In a moment, it dashes along in front of the 
station-house, and comes to a pause, the locomotive hissing and fuming in its 
eagerness to go on. How much life has come at once into this lonely place! Four 
or five long cars, each, perhaps, with fifty people in it, reading newspapers, 
reading pamphlet novels, chattering, sleeping; all this vision of passing life! 
A moment passes, while the luggage-men are putting on the trunks and packages; 
then the bell strikes a few times, and away goes the train again, quickly out 
of sight of those who remain behind, while a solitude of hours again broods 
over the station-house, which, for an instant, has thus been put in 
communication with far-off cities, and then remains by itself, with the old, 
black, ruinous church, and the black old farm-house, both built years and years 
ago,&nbsp;before railroads were ever dreamed of. Meantime, the passenger, 
stepping from the solitary station into the train, finds himself in the midst 
of a new world all in a moment. He rushes out of the solitude into a village; 
thence, though woods and hills, into a large inland town; beside the Merrimack, 
which has overflowed its banks, and eddies along, turbid as a vast mud-puddle, 
sometimes almost laying the doorstep of a house, and with trees standing in the 
flood half-way up their trunks. Boys, with newspapers to sell, or apples and 
lozenges; many passengers departing and entering, at each new station; the more 
permanent passenger, with his cheek or ticket stuck in his hat-band, where the 
conductor may see it. A party of girls, playing at ball with a young man. 
Altogether it is a scene of stirring life, with which a person who had been 
waiting long for the train to come might find it difficult at once to 
amalgamate himself.</p> 
<p>It is a sombre, brooding day, and begins to rain as the cars pass onward. 
In a little more than two hours we find ourselves in Boston surrounded by eager 
hack-men.</p> 
<p>Yesterday I went to the Athen&aelig;um, and, being received with great 
courtesy by Mr. Folsom, was shown all over the edifice from the very bottom to 
the very top, whence I looked out over Boston. It is an admirable point of 
view; but, it being an overcast and misty day, I did not get the full advantage 
of it. The library is in a noble hall, and looks splendidly with its vista of 
alcoves. The most remarkable sight, however, was Mr. Hildreth, writing his 
history of the United States. He sits at a table, at the entrance of one of the 
alcoves, with his books and papers before him, as quiet and absorbed as he 
would be in the&nbsp;loneliest study; now consulting an authority; now penning 
a sentence or paragraph, without seeming conscious of anything but his subject. 
It is very curious thus to have a glimpse of a book in process of creation 
under one's eye. I know not how many hours he sits there; but while I saw him 
he was a pattern of diligence and unwandering thought. He had taken himself out 
of the age, and put himself, I suppose, into that about which he was writing. 
Being deaf, he finds it much the easier to abstract himself. Nevertheless, it 
is a miracle. He is a thin, middle-aged man, in black, with an intelligent 
face, rather sensible than scholar-like.</p> 
<p>Mr. Folsom accompanied me to call upon Mr. Ticknor, the historian of 
Spanish literature. He has a fine house, at the corner of Park and Beacon 
Streets, perhaps the very best position in Boston. A marble hall, a wide and 
easy staircase, a respectable old man-servant, evidently long at home in the 
mansion, to admit us. We entered the library, Mr. Folsom considerably in 
advance, as being familiar with the house; and I heard Mr. Ticknor greet him in 
friendly tones, their scholar-like and bibliographical pursuits, I suppose, 
bringing them into frequent conjunction. Then I was introduced, and received 
with great distinction, but yet without any ostentatious flourish of courtesy. 
Mr. Ticknor has a great head, and his hair is gray or grayish. You recognize in 
him at once the man who knows the world, the scholar, too, which probably is 
his more distinctive character, though a little more under the surface. He was 
in his slippers; a volume of his book was open on a table, and apparently he 
had been engaged in revising or annotating it. His library is a stately and 
beautiful room for a private dwelling,&nbsp;and itself looks large and rich. 
The fireplace has a white marble frame about it, sculptured with figures and 
reliefs. Over it hung a portrait of Sir Walter Scott, a copy, I think, of the 
one that represents him in Melrose Abbey.</p> 
<p>Mr. Ticknor was most kind in his alacrity to solve the point on which Mr. 
Folsom, in my behalf, had consulted him (as to whether there had been any 
English translation of the Tales of Cervantes); and most liberal in his offers 
of books from his library. Certainly, he is a fine example of a 
generous-principled scholar, anxious to assist the human intellect in its 
efforts and researches. Methinks he must have spent a happy life (as happiness 
goes among mortals), writing his great three-volumed book for twenty years; 
writing it, not for bread, nor with any uneasy desire of fame, but only with a 
purpose to achieve something true and enduring. He is, I apprehend, a man of 
great cultivation and refinement, and with quite substance enough to be 
polished and refined, without being worn too thin in the process,--a man of 
society. He related a singular story of an attempt of his to become acquainted 
with me years ago, when he mistook my kinsman Eben for me.</p> 
<p>At half past four, I went to Mr. Thompson's, the artist who has requested 
to paint my picture. This was the second sitting. The portrait looked dimly out 
from the canvas, as from a cloud, with something that I could recognize as my 
outline, but no strong resemblance as yet. I have had thee portraits taken 
before this,--an oil picture, a miniature, and a crayon sketch,--neither of 
them satisfactory to those most familiar with my physiognomy. In fact, there is 
no such thing as a true portrait; they are all delusions, and I&nbsp;never saw 
any two alike, nor hardly any two that I would recognize merely by the 
portraits themselves, as being of the same man. A bust has more reality. This 
artist is a man of thought, and with no mean idea of his art; a Swedenborgian, 
or, as he prefers to call it, a member of the New Church; and I have generally 
found something marked in men who adopt that faith. He had painted a good 
picture of Bryant. He seems to me to possess truth in himself, and to aim at it 
in his artistic endeavors.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><em>May</em> 6<em>th.</em>--This morning it is an easterly rain 
(south-easterly, I should say just now at twelve o'clock), and I went at nine, 
by appointment, to sit for my picture. The artist painted awhile; but soon 
found that he had not so much light as was desirable, and complained that his 
tints were as muddy as the weather. Further sitting was therefore postponed 
till to-morrow at eleven. It will be a good picture; but I see no assurance, as 
yet, of the likeness. An artist's apartment is always very interesting to me, 
with its pictures, finished and unfinished; its little fancies in the pictorial 
way,--as here two sketches of children among flowers and foliage, representing 
Spring and Summer, Winter and Autumn being yet to come out of the artist's 
mind; the portraits of his wife and children; here a clergyman, there a poet; 
here a woman with the stamp of reality upon her, there a feminine conception 
which we feel not to have existed. There was an infant Christ, or rather a 
child Christ, not unbeautiful, but scarcely divine. I love the odor of paint in 
an artist's room; his palette and all his other tools have a mysterious charm 
for me. The pursuit has always interested my imagination more than any&nbsp;
other, and I remember, before having my first portrait taken, there was a great 
bewitchery in the idea, as if it were a magic process. Even now, it is not 
without interest to me.</p> 
<p>I left Mr. Thompson before ten, and took my way though the sloppy streets 
to the Athen&aelig;um, where I looked over the newspapers and periodicals, and 
found two of my old stories (&quot;Peter Goldthwaite&quot; and the &quot;Shaker 
Bridal&quot;) published as original in the last &quot;London 
Metropolitan!&quot; The English are much more unscrupulous and dishonest 
pirates than ourselves. However, if they are poor enough to perk themselves in 
such false feathers as these, Heaven help them! I glanced over the stories, and 
they seemed painfully cold and dull. It is the more singular that these should 
be so published, inasmuch as the whole book was republished in London, only a 
few months ago. Mr. Fields tells me that two publishers in London had 
advertised the &quot;Scarlet Letter&quot; as in press, each book at a shilling.
</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>* * *</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Certainly life is made much more tolerable, and man respects himself far 
more, when he takes his meals with a certain degree of order and state. There 
should be a sacred law in these matters; and, as consecrating the whole 
business, the preliminary prayer is a good and real ordinance. The advance of 
man from a savage and animal state may be as well measured by his mode and 
morality of dining, as by any other circumstance. At Mr. Fields's, soon after 
entering the house, I heard the brisk and cheerful notes of a canary-bird, 
singing with great vivacity, and making its voice echo through the large rooms. 
It was very pleasant at the close of the rainy, east-windy day, and seemed to 
fling sunshine though the dwelling.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
<p><em>May</em> 7<em>th.</em>--I did not go out yesterday afternoon, but after 
tea I went to Parker's. The drinking and smoking shop is no bad place to see 
one kind of life. The front apartment is for drinking. The door opens into 
Court Square, and is denoted, usually, by some choice specimens of dainties 
exhibited in the windows, or hanging beside the door-post; as, for instance, a 
pair of canvas-back ducks, distinguishable by their delicately mottled 
feathers; an admirable cut of raw beefsteak; a ham, ready boiled, and with 
curious figures traced in spices on its outward fat; a haif, or perchance the 
whole, of a large salmon, when in season; a bunch of partridges, etc., etc. A 
screen stands directly before the door, so as to conceal the interior from an 
outside barbarian. At the counter stand, at almost all hours,--certainly at all 
hours when I have chanced to observe,--tipplers, either taking a solitary 
glass, or treating all round, veteran topers, flashy young men, visitors from 
the country, the various petty officers connected with the law, whom the 
vicinity of the Court-House brings hither. Chiefly, they drink plain liquors, 
gin, brandy, or whiskey, sometimes a Tom and Jerry, a gin cocktail (which the 
bar-tender makes artistically, tossing it in a large parabola from one tumbler 
to another, until fit for drinking), a brandy-smash, and numerous other 
concoctions. All this toping goes forward with little or no apparent 
exhilaration of spirits; nor does this seem to be the object sought,--it being 
rather, I imagine, to create a titillation of the coats of the stomach and a 
general sense of invigoration, without affecting the brain. Very seldom does a 
man grow wild and unruly.</p> 
<p>The inner room is hung round with pictures and engravings of various 
kinds,--a painting of a&nbsp;premium ox, a lithograph of a Turk and of a 
Turkish lady, . . . and various showily engraved tailors' advertisements, and 
other shop-bills; among them all, a small painting of a drunken toper, sleeping 
on a bench beside the grog-shop,--a ragged, half-hatless, bloated, red-nosed, 
jolly, miserable-looking devil, very well done, and strangely suitable to the 
room in which it hangs. Round the walls are placed some half a dozen 
marble-topped tables, and a centre-table in the midst; most of them strewn with 
theatrical and other show-bills; and the large theatre-bills, with their type 
of gigantic solidity and blackness, hung against the walls.</p> 
<p>Last evening, when I entered, there was one guest somewhat overcome with 
liquor, and slumbering with his chair tipped against one of the marble tables. 
In the course of a quarter of an hour, he roused himself (a plain, middle-aged 
man), and went out with rather an unsteady step, and a hot, red face. One or 
two others were smoking, and looking over the papers, or glancing at a 
play-bill. From the centre of the ceiling descended a branch with two 
gas-burners, which sufficiently illuminated every corner of the room. Nothing 
is so remarkable in these bar-rooms and drinking-places, as the perfect order 
that prevails: if a man gets drunk, it is no otherwise perceptible than by his 
going to sleep, or his inability to walk.</p> 
<p>Pacing the sidewalk in front of this grog-shop of Parker's (or sometimes, 
on cold and rainy days, taking his station inside), there is generally to be 
observed an elderly ragamuffin, in a dingy and battered hat, an old surtout, 
and a more than shabby general aspect; a thin face and red nose, a patch over 
one eye, and the other half drowned in moisture. He leans in a slightly 
stooping posture on a stick, forlorn&nbsp;and silent, addressing nobody, but 
fixing his one moist eye on you with a certain intentness. He is a man who has 
been in decent circumstances at some former period of his life, but, falling 
into decay (perhaps by dint of too frequent visits at Parker's bar), he now 
haunts about the place, as a ghost haunts the spot where he was murdered, 
&quot;to collect his rents,&quot; as Parker says,--that is, to catch an 
occasional nine-pence from some charitable acquaintances, or a glass of liquor 
at the bar. The word &quot;ragamuffin,&quot; which I have used above, does not 
accurately express the man, because there is a sort of shadow or delusion of 
respectability about him, and a sobriety too, and a kind of decency in his 
groggy and red-nosed destitution.</p> 
<p>Underground, beneath the drinking and smoking rooms, is Parker's 
eating-hall, extending all the way to Court Street. All sorts of good eating 
may be had there, and a gourmand may feast at what expense he will.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>I take an interest in all the nooks and crannies and every development of 
cities; so here I try to make a description of the view from the back windows 
of a house in the centre of Boston, at which I now glance in the intervals of 
writing. The view is bounded, at perhaps thirty yards' distance, by a row of 
opposite brick dwellings, standing, I think, on Temple Place; houses of the 
better order, with tokens of genteel families visible in all the rooms betwixt 
the basements and the attic windows in the roof; plate-glass in the rear 
drawing-rooms, flower-pots in some of the windows of the upper stories. 
Occasionally, a lady's figure, either seated or appearing with a flitting grace,
&nbsp;or dimly manifest farther within the obscurity of the room. A balcony, 
with a wrought-iron fence running along under the row of drawing-room windows, 
above the basement. In the space betwixt the opposite row of dwellings and that 
in which I am situated are the low out-houses of the above-described houses, 
with flat roofs; or solid brick walls, with walks on them, and high railings, 
for the convenience of the washerwomen in hanging out their clothes. In the 
intervals are grass-plots, already green, because so sheltered; and 
fruit-trees, now beginning to put forth their leaves, and one of them, a 
cherry-tree, almost in full blossom. Birds flutter and sing among these trees. 
I should judge it a good site for the growth of delicate fruit; for, quite 
enclosed on all sides by houses, the blighting winds cannot molest the trees. 
They have sunshine on them a good part of the day, though the shadow must come 
early, and I suppose there is a rich soil about the roots. I see grapevines 
clambering against one wall, and also peeping over another, where the main body 
of the vine is invisible to me. In another place, a frame is erected for a 
grapevine, and probably it will produce as rich clusters as the vines of 
Madeira here in the heart of the city, in this little spot of fructifying 
earth, while the thunder of wheels rolls about it on every side. The trees are 
not all fruit-trees. One pretty well-grown buttonwood-tree aspires upward above 
the roofs of the houses. In the full verdure of summer, there will be quite a 
mass or curtain of foliage between the hither and the thither row of houses.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Afternoon.--At eleven, I went to give Mr. Thompson a sitting for my 
picture. I like the painter. He seems to reverence his art, and to aim at truth 
in it,&nbsp;as I said before; a man of gentle disposition too, and simplicity 
of life and character. I seated myself in the pictorial chair, with the only 
light in the room descending upon me from a high opening, almost at the 
ceiling, the rest of the sole window being shuttered. He began to work, and we 
talked in an idle and desultory way,--neither of us feeling very 
conversable,--which he attributed to the atmosphere, it being a bright, 
westwindy, bracing day. We talked about the pictures of Christ, and how 
inadequate and untrue they are. He said he thought artists should attempt only 
to paint child-Christs, human powers being inadequate to the task of painting 
such purity and holiness in a manly development. Then he said that an idea of a 
picture had occurred to him that morning while reading a chapter in the New 
Testament,--how &quot;they parted his garments among them, and for his vesture 
did cast lots.&quot; His picture was to represent the soldier to whom the 
garment without a seam had fallen, after taking it home and examining it, and 
becoming impressed with a sense of the former wearer's holiness. I do not quite 
see how he would make such a picture tell its own story;--but I find the idea 
suggestive to my own mind, and I think I could make something of it. We talked 
of physiognomy and impressions of character,--first impressions,--and how apt 
they are to come aright in the face of the closest subsequent observation.</p> 
<p>There were several visitors in the course of the sitting, one a gentleman, 
a connection from the country, with whom the artist talked about family matters 
and personal affairs,--observing on the poorness of his own business, and that 
he had thoughts of returning to New York. I wish he would meet with better&nbsp;
success. Two or three ladies also looked in. Meanwhile Mr. Thompson had been 
painting with more and more eagerness, casting quick, keen glances at me, and 
then making hasty touches on the picture, as if to secure with his brush what 
he had caught with his eye. He observed that he was just getting interested in 
the work, and I could recognize the feeling that was in him as akin to what I 
have experienced myself in the glow of composition. Nevertheless, he seemed 
able to talk about foreign matters, through it all. He continued to paint in 
this rapid way, up to the moment of closing the sitting; when he took the 
canvas from the easel, without giving me time to mark what progress he had 
made, as he did the last time.</p> 
<p>The artist is middle-sized, thin, a little stooping, with a quick, nervous 
movement. He has black hair, not thick, a beard under his chin, a small head, 
but well-developed forehead, black eyebrows, eyes keen, but kindly, and a dark 
face, not indicating robust health, but agreeable in its expression. His voice 
is gentle and sweet, and such as comes out from amidst refined feelings. He 
dresses very simply and unpictorially in a gray frock or sack, and does not 
seem to think of making a picture of himself in his own person.</p> 
<p>At dinner to-day there was a young Frenchman, whom ---- befriended a year 
or so ago, when he had not another friend in America, and obtained employment 
for him in a large dry-goods establishment. He is a young man of eighteen or 
thereabouts, with smooth black hair, neatly dressed; his face showing a good 
disposition, but with nothing of intellect or character. It is funny to think 
of this poor little Frenchman, a Parisian too, eating our most un-French 
victuals,--our beefsteaks, and roasts, and various homely&nbsp;puddings, and 
hams, and all things most incongruent to his hereditary stomach; but 
nevertheless he eats most cheerfully and uncomplainingly. He has not a large 
measure of French vivacity, never rattles, never dances, nor breaks into 
ebullitions of mirth and song; on the contrary, I have never known a youth of 
his age more orderly and decorous. He is kind-hearted and grateful, and evinces 
his gratitude to the mother of the family and to his benefactress by occasional 
presents, not trifling when measured by his small emolument of five dollars per 
week. Just at this time he is confined to his room by indisposition, caused, it 
is suspected, by a spree on Sunday last. Our gross Saxon orgies would soon be 
the ruin of his French constitution.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>A thought to-day. Great men need to be lifted upon the shoulders of the 
whole world, in order to conceive their great ideas or perform their great 
deeds. That is, there must be an atmosphere of greatness round about them. A 
hero cannot be a hero unless in an heroic world.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><em>May</em> 8<em>th.</em>--I went last evening to the National Theatre to 
see a pantomime. It was Jack the Giant-Killer, and somewhat heavy and tedious. 
The audience was more noteworthy than the play. The theatre itself is for the 
middling and lower classes, and I had not taken my seat in the most 
aristocratic part of the house; so that I found myself surrounded chiefly by 
young sailors, Hanover Street shopmen, mechanics, and other people of that 
class. It is wonderful! the difference that exists in the personal aspect and 
dress, and no less in the manners, of people in this quarter of the city, as 
compared with other parts of it.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>One would think that Oak Hall should give a common garb and air to the 
great mass of the Boston population; but it seems not to be so; and perhaps 
what is most singular is, that the natural make of the men has a conformity and 
suitableness to the dress. Glazed caps and Palo Alto hats were much worn. It is 
a pity that this picturesque and comparatively graceful hat should not have 
been generally adopted, instead of falling to the exclusive use of a rowdy 
class. In the next box to me were two young women, with an infant, but to which 
of them appertaining I could not at first discover. One was a large, plump 
girl, with a heavy face, a snub nose, coarse-looking, but good-natured, and 
with no traits of evil,--save, indeed, that she had on the vilest gown of dirty 
white cotton, so pervadingly dingy that it was white no longer, as it seemed to 
me. The sleeves were short, and ragged at the borders, and her shawl, which she 
took off on account of the heat, was old and faded,--the shabbiest and dirtiest 
dress that I ever saw a woman wear. Yet she was plump, and looked comfortable 
in body and mind. I imagine that she must have had a better dress at home, but 
had come to the theatre extemporaneously, and, not going to the dress circle, 
considered her ordinary gown good enough for the occasion. The other girl 
seemed as young or younger than herself. She was small, with a particularly 
intelligent and pleasant face, not handsome, perhaps, but as good or better 
than if it were. It was mobile with whatever sentiment chanced to be in her 
mind, as quick and vivacious a face in its movements as I have ever seen; 
cheerful, too, and indicative of a sunny, though I should think it might be a 
hasty, temper. She was dressed in a dark gown (chintz, I&nbsp;suppose, the 
women call it), a good, homely dress, proper enough for the fireside, but a 
strange one to appear in at a theatre. Both these girls appeared to enjoy 
themselves very much,--the large and heavy one in her own duller mode; the 
smaller manifesting her interest by gestures, pointing at the stage, and with 
so vivid a talk of countenance that it was precisely as if she had spoken. She 
was not a brunette, and this made the vivacity of her expression the more 
agreeable. Her companion, on the other hand, was so dark, that I rather 
suspected her to have a tinge of African blood. There were two men who seemed 
to have some connection with these girls,--one an elderly, gray-headed 
personage, well-stricken in liquor, talking loudly and foolishly, but 
good-humoredly; the other a young man, sober, and doing his best to keep his 
elder friend quiet. The girls seemed to give themselves no uneasiness about the 
matter. Both the men wore Palo Alto hats. I could not make out whether either 
of the men were the father of the child, though I was inclined to set it down 
as a family party.</p> 
<p>As the play went on, the house became crowded and oppressively warm, and 
the poor little baby grew dark red, or purple almost, with the uncomfortable 
heat in its small body. It must have been accustomed to discomfort, and have 
concluded it to be the condition of mortal life, else it never would have 
remained so quiet. Perhaps it had been quieted with a sleeping-potion. The two 
young women were not negligent of it; but passed it to and fro between them, 
each willingly putting herself to inconvenience for the sake of tending it. But 
I really feared it might die in some kind of a fit, so hot was the theatre, so 
purple with heat, yet strangely quiet, was the child. I was&nbsp;glad to hear 
it cry at last; but it did not cry with any great rage and vigor, as it should, 
but in a stupid kind of way. Hereupon the smaller of the two girls, after a 
little inefficacious dandling, at once settled the question of maternity by 
nursing her baby. Children must be hard to kill, however injudicious the 
treatment. The two girls and their cavaliers remained till nearly the close of 
the play. I should like well to know who they are,--of what condition in life, 
and whether reputable as members of the class to which they belong. My own 
judgment is that they are so. Throughout the evening, drunken young sailors 
kept stumbling into and out of the boxes, calling to one another from different 
parts of the house, shouting to the performers, and singing the burden of 
songs. It was a scene of life in the rough.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><em>May</em> 14<em>th.</em>--A stable opposite the house,--an old wooden 
construction, low, in three distinct parts; the centre being the stable proper, 
where the horses are kept, and with a chamber over it for the hay. On one side 
is the department for chaises and carriages; on the other, the little office 
where the books are kept. In the interior region of the stable everything is 
dim and undefined,--half-traceable outlines of stalls, sometimes the shadowy 
aspect of a horse. Generally a groom is dressing a horse at the stable door, 
with a care and accuracy that leave no part of the animal unvisited by the 
currycomb and brush; the horse, meanwhile, evidently enjoying it, but 
sometimes, when the more sensitive parts are touched, giving a half-playful 
kick with his hind legs, and a little neigh. If the men bestowed half as much 
care on their own personal cleanliness, they would be all the better and&nbsp;
healthier men therefor. They appear to be busy men, these stablers, yet have a 
lounging way with them, as if indolence were somehow diffused through their 
natures. The apparent head of the establishment is a sensible, 
thoughtful-looking, large-featured, and homely man, past the middle age, clad 
rather shabbily in gray, stooping somewhat, and without any smartness about 
him. There is a groom, who seems to be a very comfortable kind of personage,--a 
man of forty-five or thereabouts (R. W. Emerson says he was one of his 
schoolmates), but not looking so old; corpulent, not to say fat, with a white 
frock, which his goodly bulk almost fills, enveloping him from neck nearly to 
ankles. On his head he wears a cloth cap of a jockey shape; his pantaloons are 
turned up an inch or two at bottom, and he wears brogans on his feet. His hair, 
as may be seen when he takes off his cap to wipe his brow, is black and in 
perfect preservation, with not exactly a curl, yet a vivacious and elastic kind 
of twist in it. His face is fresh-colored, comfortable, sufficiently vivid in 
expression, not at all dimmed by his fleshly exuberance, because the man 
possesses vigor enough to carry it off. His bodily health seems perfect; so, 
indeed, does his moral and intellectual. He is very active and assiduous in his 
duties, currycombing and rubbing down the horses with alacrity and skill; and, 
when not otherwise occupied, you may see him talking jovially with chance 
acquaintances, or observing what is going forward in the street. If a female 
acquaintance happens to pass, he touches his jockey cap, and bows, 
accomplishing this courtesy with a certain smartness that proves him a man of 
the world. Whether it be his greater readiness to talk, or the wisdom of what 
he says, he seems usually to be&nbsp;the centre talker of the group. It is very 
pleasant to see such an image of earthly comfort as this. A fat man who feels 
his flesh as a disease and encumbrance, and on whom it presses so as to make 
him melancholy with dread of apoplexy, and who moves heavily under the burden 
of himself,--such a man is a doleful and disagreeable object. But if he have 
vivacity enough to pervade all his earthiness, and bodily force enough to move 
lightly under it, and if it be not too unmeasured to have a trimness and 
briskness in it, then it is good and wholesome to look at him.</p> 
<p>In the background of the house, a cat, occasionally stealing along on the 
roofs of the low out-houses; descending a flight of wooden steps into the brick 
area; investigating the shed, and entering all dark and secret places; 
cautious, circumspect, as if in search of something; noiseless, attentive to 
every noise. Moss grows on spots of the roof; there are little boxes of earth 
here and there, with plants in them. The grass-plots appertaining to each of 
the houses whose rears are opposite ours (standing in Temple Place) are perhaps 
ten or twelve feet broad, and three times as long. Here and there is a large, 
painted garden-pot, half buried in earth. Besides the large trees in blossom, 
there are little ones, probably of last year's setting out. Early in the day 
chambermaids are seen hanging the bedclothes out of the upper windows; at the 
window of the basement of the same house, I see a woman ironing. Were I a 
solitary prisoner, I should not doubt to find occupation of deep interest for 
my whole day in watching only one of the houses. One house seems to be quite 
shut up; all the blinds in the three windows of each of the four stories being 
closed, although in the roof-windows of the attic story the&nbsp;curtains are 
hung carelessly upward, instead of being drawn. I think the house is empty, 
perhaps for the summer. The visible side of the whole row of houses is now in 
the shade,--they looking towards, I should say, the southwest. Later in the 
day, they are wholly covered with sunshine, and continue so through the 
afternoon; and at evening the sunshine slowly withdraws upward, gleams aslant 
upon the windows, perches on the chimneys, and so disappears. The upper part of 
the spire and the weathercock of the Park Street Church appear over one of the 
houses, looking as if it were close behind. It shows the wind to be east now. 
At one of the windows of the third story sits a woman in a colored dress, 
diligently sewing on something white. She sews, not like a lady, but with an 
occupational air. Her dress, I observe, on closer observation, is a kind of 
loose morning sack, with, I think, a silky gloss on it; and she seems to have a 
silver comb in her hair,--no, this latter item is a mistake. Sheltered as the 
space is between the two rows of houses, a puff of the eastwind finds its way 
in, and shakes off some of the withering blossoms from the cherry-trees.</p> 
<p>Quiet as the prospect is, there is a continual and near thunder of wheels 
proceeding from Washington Street. In a building not far off, there is a hall 
for exhibitions; and sometimes, in the evenings, loud music is heard from it; 
or, if a diorama be shown (that of Bunker Hill, for instance, or the burning of 
Moscow), an immense racket of imitative cannon and musketry.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><em>May</em> 16<em>th.</em>--It has been an easterly rain yesterday and 
to-day, with occasional lightings up, and then a heavy downfall of the gloom 
again.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Scenes out of the rear windows,--the glistening roof of the opposite 
houses; the chimneys, now and then choked with their own smoke, which a blast 
drives down their throats. The church-spire has a mist about it. Once this 
morning a solitary dove came and alighted on the peak of an attic window, and 
looked down into the areas, remaining in this position a considerable time. Now 
it has taken a flight, and alighted on the roof of this house, directly over 
the window at which I sit, so that I can look up and see its head and beak, and 
the tips of its claws. The roofs of the low out-houses are black with moisture; 
the gutters are full of water, and there is a little puddle where there is a 
place for it in the hollow of a board. On the grass-plot are strewn the fallen 
blossoms of the cherry-tree, and over the scene broods a parallelogram of 
sombre sky. Thus it will be all day as it was yesterday; and, in the evening, 
one window after another will be lighted up in the drawing-rooms. Through the 
white curtains may be seen the gleam of an astral-lamp, like a fixed star. In 
the basement rooms, the work of the kitchen going forward; in the upper 
chambers, here and there a light.</p> 
<p>In a bar-room, a large, oval basin let into the counter, with a brass tube 
rising from the centre, out of which gushes continually a miniature fountain, 
and descends in a soft, gentle, never-ceasing rain into the basin, where swim a 
company of gold-fishes. Some of them gleam brightly in their golden armor; 
others have a dull white aspect, going through some process of transformation. 
One would think that the atmosphere, continually filled with tobacco-smoke, 
might impregnate the water unpleasantly for the scaly people; but then it is 
continually flowing away and being&nbsp;renewed. And what if some toper should 
be seized with the freak of emptying his glass of gin or brandy into the 
basin,--would the fishes die or merely get jolly?</p> 
<p>I saw, for a wonder, a man pretty drunk at Parker's the other evening,--a 
well-dressed man, of not ungentlemanly aspect. He talked loudly and foolishly, 
but in good phrases, with a great flow of language, and he was no otherwise 
impertinent than in addressing his talk to strangers. Finally, after sitting a 
long time staring steadfastly across the room in silence, he arose, and 
staggered away as best he might, only showing his very drunken state when he 
attempted to walk.</p> 
<p>Old acquaintances,--a gentleman whom I knew ten years ago, brisk, active, 
vigorous, with a kind of fire of physical well-being and cheerful spirits 
glowing through him. Now, after a course, I presume, of rather free living, 
pale, thin, oldish, with a grave and care or pain worn brow,--yet still lively 
and cheerful in his accost, though with something invincibly saddened in his 
tones. Another, formerly commander of a revenue vessel,--a man of splendid 
epaulets and very aristocratic equipment and demeanor; now out of service and 
without position, and changed into a brandy-burnt and rowdyish sort of 
personage. He seemed as if he might still be a gentleman if he would; but his 
manners show a desperate state of mind by their familiarity, recklessness, the 
lack of any hedge of reserve about himself, while still he is evidently a man 
of the world, accustomed to good society. He has latterly, I think, been in the 
Russian service, and would very probably turn pirate on fair occasion.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Lenox, <em>July</em> 14<em>th.</em>--The tops of the chestnut-trees have a 
whitish appearance, they being, I suppose, in bloom. Red raspberries are just 
through the season.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Language,--human language,--after all, is but little better than the croak 
and cackle of fowls and other utterances of brute nature,--sometimes not so 
adequate.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><em>July</em> 16<em>th.</em>--The tops of the chestnut-trees are peculiarly 
rich, as if a more luscious sunshine were falling on them than anywhere else. 
&quot;Whitish,&quot; as above, don't express it.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The queer gestures and sounds of a hen looking about for a place to deposit 
her egg; her self-important gait; the sideway turn of her head and cock of her 
eye, as she pries into one and another nook, croaking all the while,--evidently 
with the idea that the egg in question is the most important thing that has 
been brought to pass since the world began. A speckled black and white and 
tufted hen of ours does it to most ludicrous perfection; and there is something 
laughably womanish in it too.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><em>July</em> 25<em>th.</em>--As I sit in my study, with the windows open, 
the occasional incident of the visit of some winged creature,--wasp, hornet, or 
bee,--entering out of the warm, sunny atmosphere, soaring round the room in 
large sweeps, then buzzing against the glass, as not satisfied with the place, 
and desirous of getting out. Finally, the joyous uprising curve with which, 
coming to the open part of the window, it emerges into the cheerful glow of the 
outside.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
<p><em>August</em> 4<em>th.</em>--Dined at hotel with J. T. Fields and wife. 
Afternoon, drove with them to Pittsfield and called on Dr. Holmes.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><em>August</em> 5<em>th.</em>--Drove with Fields and his wife to 
Stockbridge, being thereto invited by Mr. Field of Stockbridge, in order to 
ascend Monument Mountain. Found at Mr. Field's Dr. Holmes and Mr. Duyckinck of 
New York; also Mr. Cornelius Matthews and Herman Melville. Ascended the 
mountain: that is to say, Mrs. Fields and Miss Jenny Field, Mr. Field and Mr. 
Fields, Dr. Holmes, Messrs. Duyckinck, Matthews, Melville, Mr. Henry Sedgewick, 
and I, and were caught in a shower. Dined at Mr. Field's. Afternoon, under 
guidance of J. T. Headley, the party scrambled though the ice-glen.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><em>August</em> 7<em>th.</em>--Messrs. Duyckinck, Matthews, Melville, and 
Melville, Junior, called in the forenoon. Gave them a couple of bottles of Mr. 
Mansfield's champagne, and walked down to the lake with them. At twilight Mr. 
Edwin P. Whipple and wife called.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><em>August</em> 8<em>th.</em>--Mr. and Mrs. Whipple took tea with us.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><em>August</em> 12<em>th.</em>--Seven chickens hatched. J. T. Headley and 
brother called. Eight chickens.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><em>August</em> 19<em>th.</em>--Monument Mountain, in the early sunshine; 
its base enveloped in mist, parts of which are floating in the sky, so that the 
great hill looks really as if it were founded on a cloud. Just emerging from 
the mist is seen a yellow field of rye, and, above that, forest.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
<p><em>August</em> 21<em>st.</em>--Eight more chickens hatched. Ascended a 
mountain with my wife; a beautiful, mellow, autumnal sunshine.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><em>August</em> 24<em>th.</em>--In the afternoons, nowadays, this valley in 
which I dwell seems like a vast basin filled with golden sunshine as with wine.
</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><em>August</em> 31<em>st.</em>--J. R. Lowell called in the evening.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><em>September</em> 1<em>st.</em>--Mr. and Mrs. Lowell called in the 
forenoon, on their way to Stockbridge or Lebanon, to meet Miss Bremer.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><em>September</em> 2<em>d.</em>--&quot;When I grow up,&quot; quoth J----, 
in illustration of the might to which he means to attain,--&quot;when I grow 
up, I shall be two men.&quot;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><em>September</em> 3<em>d.</em>--Foliage of maples begins to change. 
Julian, after picking up a handful of autumnal maple-leaves the other 
day,--&quot;Look, papa, here's a bunch of fire!&quot;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><em>September</em> 7<em>th.</em>--In a wood, a heap or pile of logs and 
sticks, that had been cut for firewood, and piled up square, in order to be 
carted away to the house when convenience served,--or, rather, to be sledded in 
sleighing time. But the moss had accumulated on them, and leaves falling over 
them from year to year and decaying, a kind of soil had quite covered them, 
although the softened outline of the woodpile was perceptible in the green 
mound. It was perhaps fifty years--perhaps more--since the woodman had cut and 
piled those logs and sticks, intending them for his&nbsp;winter fires. But he 
probably needs no fire now. There was something strangely interesting in this 
simple circumstance. Imagine the long-dead woodman, and his long-dead wife and 
family, and the old man who was a little child when the wood was cut, coming 
back from their graves, and trying to make a fire with this mossy fuel.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><em>September</em> 19<em>th.</em>--Lying by the lake yesterday afternoon, 
with my eyes shut, while the waves and sunshine were playing together on the 
water, the quick glimmer of the wavelets was perceptible through my closed 
eyelids.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><em>October</em> 13<em>th.</em>--A windy day, with wind north-west, cool, 
with a prevalence of dull gray clouds over the sky, but with brief, quick 
glimpses of sunshine,</p> 
<p>The foliage having its autumn hues, Monument Mountain looks like a headless 
sphinx, wrapped in a rich Persian shawl. Yesterday, through a diffused mist, 
with the sun shining on it, it had the aspect of burnished copper. The 
sun-gleams on the hills are peculiarly magnificent just in these days.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>One of the children, drawing a cow on the black-board, says, &quot;I'll 
kick this leg out a little more,&quot;--a very happy energy of expression, 
completely identifying herself with the cow; or perhaps, as the cow's creator, 
conscious of full power over its movements.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><em>October</em> 14<em>th.</em>--The brilliancy of the foliage has passed 
its acme; and indeed it has not been so magnificent this season as in some 
others, owing to the gradual approaches of cooler weather, and there&nbsp;
having been slight frosts instead of severe ones. There is still a shaggy 
richness on the hill-sides.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><em>October</em> 16<em>th.</em>--A morning mist, filling up the whole 
length and breadth of the valley betwixt my house and Monument Mountain, the 
summit of the mountain emerging. The mist reaches almost to my window, so dense 
as to conceal everything, except that near its hither boundary a few ruddy or 
yellow tree-tops appear, glorified by the early sunshine, as is likewise the 
whole mist-cloud.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>There is a glen between this house and the lake, through which winds a 
little brook with pools and tiny waterfalls over the great roots of trees. The 
glen is deep and narrow, and filled with trees; so that, in the summer, it is 
all a dense shadow of obscurity. Now, the foliage of the trees being almost 
entirely a golden yellow, instead of being full of shadow, the glen is 
absolutely full of sunshine, and its depths are more brilliant than the open 
plain or the mountain-tops. The trees are sunshine, and, many of the golden 
leaves being freshly fallen, the glen is strewn with sunshine, amid which winds 
and gurgles the bright, dark little brook.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><em>December</em> 1<em>st.</em>--I saw a dandelion in bloom near the lake.

<p>Ladislaus, King of Naples, besieging the city of Florence, agreed to show

gave her a perfumed handkerchief, at that time a universal decoration, richly 
wrought. This handkerchief was poisoned with his utmost art, . . . and they

of divinity. Printed at Boston &quot;for Thomas Hancock, and sold at his shop

bettering themselves, although their objects lie at less distance before them 
than ours can do. Thus, no argument for the imperfect character of our 
existence and its delusory promises, and its apparent injustice, can be drawn 
in reference to our immortality, without, in a degree, being applicable to our 
brute brethren.</p>

<h3>[1851]</h3> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><em>Lenox, February</em> 12<em>th,</em> 1851.--A walk across the lake with 
Una. A heavy rain, some days ago, has melted a good deal of the snow on the 
intervening descent between our house and the lake; but many drifts, depths, 
and levels yet remain; and there is a frozen crust, sufficient to bear a man s 
weight, and very slippery. Adown the slopes there are tiny rivulets, which 
exist only for the winter. Bare, brown spaces of grass here and there, but 
still so infrequent as only to diversify the scene a little. In the woods, 
rocks emerging, and, where there is a slope immediately towards the lake, the 
snow is pretty much gone, and we see partridge-berries frozen, and outer shells 
of walnuts, and chestnut-burrs, heaped or scattered among the roots of the 
trees. The walnut-husks mark the place where the boys, after nutting, sat down 
to clear the walnuts of their outer shell. The various species of pine look 
exceedingly brown just now,--less beautiful than those trees which shed their 
leaves. An oak-tree, with almost all its brown foliage still rustling on it. We 
clamber down the bank, and step upon the frozen lake. It was snow-covered for a 
considerable time; but the rain overspread it with a&nbsp;surface of water, or 
imperfectly melted snow, which is now hard frozen again; and the thermometer 
having been frequently below zero, I suppose the ice may be four or five feet 
thick. Frequently there are great cracks across it, caused, I suppose, by the 
air beneath, and giving an idea of greater firmness than if there were no 
cracks; round holes, which have been hewn in the marble pavement by fishermen, 
and are now frozen over again, looking darker than the rest of the surface; 
spaces where the snow was more imperfectly dissolved than elsewhere; little 
crackling spots, where a thin surface of ice, over the real mass, crumples 
beneath one's foot; the track of a line of footsteps, most of them vaguely 
formed, but some quite perfectly, where a person passed across the lake while 
its surface was in a state of slush, but which are now as hard as adamant, and 
remind one of the traces discovered by geologists in rocks that hardened 
thousands of ages ago. It seems as if the person passed when the lake was in an 
intermediate state between ice and water. In one spot some pine boughs, which 
somebody had cut and heaped there for an unknown purpose. In the centre of the 
lake, we see the surrounding hills in a new attitude, this being a basin in the 
midst of them. Where they are covered with wood, the aspect is gray or black; 
then there are bare slopes of unbroken snow, the outlines and indentations 
being much more hardly and firmly defined than in summer. We went southward 
across the lake, directly towards Monument Mountain, which reposes, as I said, 
like a headless sphinx. Its prominences, projections, and roughnesses are very 
evident; and it does not present a smooth and placid front, as when the grass 
is green and the trees in leaf. At one end, too, we are&nbsp;sensible of 
precipitous descents, black and shaggy with the forest that is likely always to 
grow there; and, in one streak, a headlong sweep downward of snow. We just set 
our feet on the farther shore, and then immediately returned, facing the 
northwest-wind, which blew very sharply against us.</p> 
<p>After landing, we came homeward, tracing up the little brook so far as it 
lay in our course. It was considerably swollen, and rushed fleetly on its 
course between overhanging banks of snow and ice, from which depended 
adamantine icicles. The little waterfalls with which we had impeded it in the 
summer and autumn could do no more than form a large ripple, so much greater 
was the volume of water. In some places the crust of frozen snow made a bridge 
quite over the brook; so that you only knew it was there by its brawling sound 
beneath.</p> 
<p>The sunsets of winter are incomparably splendid, and when the ground is 
covered with snow, no brilliancy of tint expressible by words can come within 
an infinite distance of the effect. Our southern view at that time, with the 
clouds and atmospherical hues, is quite indescribable and unimaginable; and the 
various distances of the hills which lie between us and the remote dome of 
Taconic are brought out with an accuracy unattainable in summer. The 
transparency of the air at this season has the effect of a telescope in 
bringing objects apparently near, while it leaves the scene all its breadth. 
The sunset sky, amidst its splendor, has a softness and delicacy that impart 
themselves to a white marble world,</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><em>February,</em> 18<em>th.</em>--A walk, yesterday afternoon, with the 
children; a bright, and rather cold day, breezy&nbsp;from the north and 
westward. There has been a good deal of soaking rain lately, and it has, in 
great measure, cleared hills and plains of snow, only it may be seen lying in 
spots, and on each side of stone-walls, in a pretty broad streak. The grass is 
brown and withered, and yet, scattered all amongst it, on close inspection, one 
finds a greenness;--little shrubs that have kept green under all the severity 
of winter, and seem to need no change to fit them for midsummer. In the woods 
we see stones covered with moss that retains likewise a most lively green. 
Where the trees are dense, the snow still lies under them. On the sides of the 
mountains, some miles off, the black pines and the white snow among them 
together produce a gray effect. The little streams are most interesting objects 
at this time; some that have an existence only at this season,--Mississippis of 
the moment,--yet glide and tumble along as if they were perennial. The familiar 
ones seem strange by their breadth and volume; their little waterfalls set off 
by glaciers on a small scale. The sun has by this time force enough to make 
sheltered nooks in the angles of woods, or on banks, warm and comfortable. The 
lake is still of adamantine substance, but all round the borders there is a 
watery margin, altogether strewed or covered with thin and broken ice, so that 
I could not venture on it with the children. A chickadee was calling in the 
woods yesterday,--the only small bird I have taken note of yet; but crows have 
been cawing in the woods for a week past, though not in very great numbers.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><em>February</em> 22<em>d.</em>--For the last two or three days there has 
been a warm, soaking, southeasterly rain, with a spongy moisture diffused 
through the&nbsp;atmosphere. The snow has disappeared, except in spots which 
are the ruins of high drifts, and patches far up on the hill-sides. The mists 
rest all day long on the brows of the hills that shut in our valley. The road 
over which I walk every day to and from the village is in the worst state of 
mud and mire, soft, slippery, nasty to tread upon; while the grass beside it is 
scarcely better, being so oozy and so overflowed with little streams, and 
sometimes an absolute bog. The rivulets race along the road, adown the hills; 
and wherever there is a permanent brooklet, however generally insignificant, it 
is now swollen into importance, and the rumble and tumble of its waterfalls may 
be heard a long way off. The general effect of the day and scenery is black, 
black, black. The streams are all as turbid as mud-puddles.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Imitators of original authors might be compared to plaster casts of marble 
statues, or the imitative book to a cast of the original marble.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><em>March</em> 11<em>th.</em>--After the ground had been completely freed 
of snow, there has been a snow-storm for the two days preceding yesterday, 
which made the earth all white again. This morning at sunrise, the thermometer 
stood at about 18 degrees above zero. Monument Mountain stands out in great 
prominence, with its dark forest-covered sides, and here and there a large, 
white patch, indicating tillage or pasture land; but making a generally dark 
contrast with the white expanse of the frozen and snow-covered lake at its 
base, and the more undulating white of the surrounding country. Yesterday, 
under the sunshine of mid-day, and with many voluminous clouds hanging over
&nbsp;it, and a mist of wintry warmth in the air, it had a kind of visionary 
aspect, although still it was brought out in striking relief. But though one 
could see all its bulgings, round swells, and precipitous abruptnesses, it 
looked as much akin to the clouds as to solid earth and rock substance. In the 
early sunshine of the morning, the atmosphere being very clear, I saw the dome 
of Taconic with more distinctness than ever before, the snow-patches, and 
brown, uncovered soil on its round head, being fully visible. Generally it is 
but a dark blue unvaried mountain-top. All the ruggedness of the intervening 
hill-country was likewise effectively brought out. There seems to be a sort of 
illuminating quality in new snow, which it loses after being exposed for a day 
or two to the sun and atmosphere.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>For a child's story,--the voyage of a little boat made of a chip, with a 
birch-bark sail, down a river.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><em>March</em> 31<em>st.</em>--A walk with the children yesterday forenoon. 
We went through the wood, where we found partridge-berries, half hidden among 
the dry, fallen leaves; thence down to the brook. This little brook has not 
cleansed itself from the disarray of the past autumn and winter, and is much 
embarrassed and choked up with brown leaves, twigs, and bits of branches. It 
rushes along merrily and rapidly, gurgling cheerfully, and tumbling over the 
impediments of stones with which the children and I made little waterfalls last 
year. At many spots, there are small basins or pools of calmer and smoother 
depth,--three feet, perhaps, in diameter, and a foot or two deep,--in which 
little fish are already sporting about; all&nbsp;elsewhere is tumble and gurgle 
and mimic turbulence. I sat on the withered leaves at the foot of a tree, while 
the children played, a little brook being the most fascinating plaything that a 
child can have. Una jumped to and fro across it; Julian stood beside a pool 
fishing with a stick, without hook or line, and wondering that he caught 
nothing. Then he made new waterfalls with mighty labor, pulling big stones out 
of the earth, and flinging them into the current. Then they sent branches of 
trees, or the outer shells of walnuts, sailing down the stream, and watched 
their passages through the intricacies of the way,--how they were hurried over 
in a cascade, hurried dizzily round in a whirlpool, or brought quite to a 
stand-still amongst the collected rubbish. At last Julian tumbled into the 
brook, and was wetted through and through, so that we were obliged to come 
home; he squelching along all the way, with his india-rubber shoes full of 
water.</p> 
<p>There are still patches of snow on the hills; also in the woods, especially 
on the northern margins. The lake is not yet what we may call thawed out, 
although there is a large space of blue water, and the ice is separated from 
the shore everywhere, and is soft, water-soaked, and crumbly. On favorable 
slopes and exposures, the earth begins to look green; and almost anywhere, if 
one looks closely, one sees the greenness of the grass, or of little herbage, 
amidst the brown. Under the nut-trees are scattered some of the nuts of last 
year; the walnuts have lost their virtue, the chestnuts do not seem to have 
much taste, but the butternuts are in no manner deteriorated. The warmth of 
these days has a mistiness, and in many respects resembles the Indian summer, 
and is not at all provocative of physical exertion. Nevertheless, the general
&nbsp;impression is of life, not death. One feels that a new season has begun.
</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><em>Wednesday, April</em> 9<em>th.</em>--There was a great rain 
yesterday,--wind from the southeast, and the last visible vestige of snow 
disappeared. It was a small patch near the summit of Bald Mountain, just on the 
upper verge of a grove of trees. I saw a slight remnant of it yesterday 
afternoon, but to-day it is quite gone. The grass comes up along the roadside 
and on favorable exposures, with a sort of green blush. Frogs have been 
melodious for a fortnight, and the birds sing pleasantly.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><em>April</em> 20<em>th.</em>--The children found Houstonias more than a 
week ago. There have been easterly wind, continual cloudiness, and occasional 
rain, for a week. This morning opened with a great snow-storm from the 
northeast, one of the most earnest snow-storms of the year, though rather more 
moist than in midwinter. The earth is entirely covered. Now, as the day 
advances towards noon, it shows some symptoms of turning to rain.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><em>April</em> 28<em>th.</em>--For a week we have found the trailing 
arbutus pretty abundant in the woods. A day or two since, Una found a few 
purple violets, and yesterday a dandelion in bloom. The fragrance of the 
arbutus is spicy and exquisite.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><em>May</em> 16<em>th.</em>--In our walks now, the children and I find 
blue, white, and golden violets, the former, especially, of great size and 
richness. Houstonias are abundant, blue-whitening some of the pastures. They
&nbsp;are a very sociable little flower, and dwell close together in 
communities,--sometimes covering a space no larger than the palm of the hand, 
but keeping one another in cheerful heart and life,--sometimes they occupy a 
much larger space. Lobelia, a pink flower, growing in the woods. Columbines, of 
a pale red, because they have lacked sun, growing in rough and rocky places on 
banks in the copses, precipitating towards the lake. The leaves of the trees 
are not yet out, but are so apparent that the woods are getting a very decided 
shadow. Water-weeds on the edge of the lake, of a deep green, with roots that 
seem to have nothing to do with earth, but with water only.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><em>May</em> 23<em>d.</em>--I think the face of nature can never look more 
beautiful than now, with this so fresh and youthful green,--the trees not being 
fully in leaf, yet enough so to give airy shade to the woods. The sunshine 
fills them with green light. Monument Mountain and its brethren are green, and 
the lightness of the tint takes away something from their massiveness and 
ponderosity, and they respond with livelier effect to the shine and shade of 
the sky. Each tree now within sight stands out in its own individuality of hue. 
This is a very windy day, and the light shifts with magical alternation. In a 
walk to the lake just now with the children, we found abundance of 
flowers,--wild geranium, violets of all families, red columbines, and many 
others known and unknown, besides innumerable blossoms of the wild strawberry, 
which has been in bloom for the past fortnight. The Houstonias seem quite to 
overspread some pastures, when viewed from a distance. Not merely the flowers, 
but the various shrubs which one sees,--seated, for instance, on the&nbsp;
decayed trunk of a tree,--are well worth looking at, such a variety and such 
enjoyment they have of their new growth. Amid these fresh creations, we see 
others that have already run their course, and have done with warmth and 
sunshine,--the hoary periwigs, I mean, of dandelions gone to seed.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><em>October</em> 2l<em>st.</em>--Going to the village yesterday afternoon, 
I saw the face of a beautiful woman, gazing at me from a cloud. It was the full 
face, not the bust. It had a sort of mantle on the head, and a pleasant 
expression of countenance. The vision lasted while I took a few steps, and then 
vanished. I never before saw nearly so distinct a cloud-picture, or rather 
sculpture; for it came out in alto-rilievo on the body of the cloud.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><em>October</em> 27<em>th.</em>--The ground this morning is white with a 
thin covering of snow. The foliage has still&nbsp;some variety of hue. The dome 
of Taconic looks dark, and seems to have no snow on it, though I don't 
understand how that can be. I saw, a moment ago, on the lake, a very singular 
spectacle. There is a high northwest-wind ruffling the lake's surface, and 
making it blue, lead-colored, or bright, in stripes or at intervals; but what I 
saw was a boiling up of foam, which began at the right bank of the lake, and 
passed quite across it; and the mist flew before it, like the cloud out of a 
steam-engine. A fierce and narrow blast of wind must have ploughed the water in 
a straight line, from side to side of the lake. As fast as it went on, the foam 
subsided behind it, so that it looked somewhat like a sea-serpent, or other 
monster, swimming very rapidly.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><em>October</em> 29<em>th.</em>--On a walk to Scott's pond, with Ellery 
Channing, we found a wild strawberry in the woods, not quite ripe, but 
beginning to redden. For a week or two, the cider-mills have been grinding 
apples. Immense heaps of apples lie piled near them, and the creaking of the 
press is heard as the horse treads on. Farmers are repairing cider-barrels; and 
the wayside brook is made to pour itself into the bunghole of a barrel, in 
order to cleanse it for the new cider.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><em>November</em> 3<em>d.</em>--The face of the country is dreary now in a 
cloudy day like the present. The woods on the hill-sides look almost black, and 
the cleared spaces a kind of gray brown.</p> 
<p>Taconic, this morning (4th), was a black purple, as dense and distinct as 
Monument Mountain itself. I hear the creaking of the cider-press; the patient 
horse&nbsp;going round and round, perhaps thirsty, to make the liquor which he 
never can enjoy.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>We left Lenox Friday morning, November 21, 1851, in a storm of snow and 
sleet, and took the cars at Pittsfield, and arrived at West Newton that evening.

<p>Happiness in this world, when it comes, comes incidentally. Make it the 
object of pursuit, and it leads us a wild-goose chase, and is never attained. 
Follow some other object, and very possibly we may find that we have caught 
happiness without dreaming of it; but likely enough it is gone the moment we 
say to ourselves, &quot;Here it is!&quot; like the chest of gold that 
treasure-seekers find.</p>

<p><em>Concord, Mass., August</em> 20<em>th.</em>--A piece of land contiguous 
to and connected with a handsome estate, to the adornment and good appearance 
of which it was essential. But the owner of the strip of land was at variance 
with the owner of the estate, so he always refused to sell it at any price, but 
let it lie there, wild and ragged, in front of and near the mansion-house.&nbsp;
When he dies, the owner of the estate, who has rejoiced at the approach of the 
event all through his enemy's illness, hopes at last to buy it; but, to his 
infinite discomfiture, the enemy enjoined in his will that his body should be 
buried in the centre of this strip of land. All sorts of ugly weeds grow most 
luxuriantly out of the grave in poisonous rankness.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><em>The Isles of Shoals, Monday, August</em> 30<em>th.</em>--Left Concord 
at a quarter of nine A.M. Friday, September 3, set sail at about half past ten 
to the Isles of Shoals. The passengers were an old master of a vessel; a young, 
rather genteel man from Greenland, N. H.; two Yankees from Hamilton and 
Danvers; and a country trader (I should judge) from some inland town of New 
Hampshire. The old sea-captain, preparatory to sailing, bought a bunch of 
cigars (they cost ten cents), and occasionally puffed one. The two Yankees had 
brought guns on board, and asked questions about the fishing of the Shoals. 
They were young men, brothers, the youngest a shopkeeper in Danvers, the other 
a farmer, I imagine, at Hamilton, and both specimens of the least polished kind 
of Yankee, and therefore proper to those localities. They were at first full of 
questions, and greatly interested in whatever was going forward; but anon the 
shopkeeper began to grow, first a little, then very sick, till he lay along the 
boat, longing, as he afterwards said, for a little fresh water to be drowned 
in. His brother attended him in a very kindly way, but became sick himself 
before he reached the end of the voyage.</p> 
<p>The young Greenlander talked politics, or rather discussed the personal 
character of Pierce. The New&nbsp;Hampshire trader said not a word, or hardly 
one, all the way. A Portsmouth youth (whom I forgot to mention) sat in the 
stern of the boat, looking very white. The skipper of the boat is a Norwegian, 
a good-natured fellow, not particularly intelligent, and speaking in a dialect 
somewhat like Irish. He had a man with him, a silent and rather sulky fellow, 
who, at the captain's bidding, grimly made himself useful.</p> 
<p>The wind not being favorable, we had to make several tacks before reaching 
the islands, where we arrived at about two o'clock. We landed at Appledore, on 
which is Laighton's Hotel,--a large building with a piazza or promenade before 
it, about an hundred and twenty feet in length, or more,--yes, it must be more. 
It is an edifice with a centre and two wings, the central part upwards of 
seventy feet. At one end of the promenade is a covered veranda, thirty or forty 
feet square, so situated that the breeze draws across it from the sea on one 
side of the island to the sea on the other, and it is the breeziest and 
comfortablest place in the world on a hot day. There are two swings beneath it, 
and here one may sit or walk, and enjoy life, while all other mortals are 
suffering.</p> 
<p>As I entered the door of the hotel, there met me a short, corpulent, round, 
and full-faced man, rather elderly, if not old. He was a little lame. He 
addressed me in a hearty, hospitable tone, and, judging that it must be my 
landlord, I delivered a letter of introduction from Pierce. Of course it was 
fully efficient in obtaining the best accommodations that were to be had. I 
found that we were expected, a man having brought the news of our intention the 
day before. Here ensued great inquiries after the&nbsp;General, and wherefore 
he had not come. I was looked at with considerable curiosity on my own account, 
especially by the ladies, of whom there were several, agreeable and pretty 
enough. There were four or five gentlemen, most of whom had not much that was 
noteworthy.</p> 
<p>After dinner, which was good and abundant, though somewhat rude in its 
style, I was introduced by Mr. Laighton to Mr. Thaxter, his son-in-law, and Mr. 
Weiss, a clergyman of New Bedford, who is staying here for his health. They 
showed me some of the remarkable features of the island, such as a deep chasm 
in the cliffs of the shore, towards the southwest; also a monument of rude 
stones, on the highest point of the island, said to have been erected by 
Captain John Smith before the settlement at Plymouth. The tradition is just as 
good as truth. Also, some ancient cellars, with thistles and other weeds 
growing in them, and old fragmentary bricks scattered about. The date of these 
habitations is not known; but they may well be the remains of the settlement 
that Cotton Mather speaks about; or perhaps one of them was the house where Sir 
William Pepperell was born, and where he went when he and somebody else set up 
a stick, and travelled to seek their fortunes in the direction in which it fell.
</p> 
<p>In the evening, the company at the hotel made up two whist parties, at one 
of which I sat down,--my partner being an agreeable young lady from Portsmouth. 
We played till I, at least, was quite weary. It had been the beautifullest of 
weather all day, very hot on the mainland, but a delicious climate under our 
veranda.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
<p><em>Saturday, September</em> 4<em>th.</em>--Another beautiful day, rather 
cooler than the preceding, but not too cool. I can bear this coolness better 
than that of the interior. In the forenoon, I took passage for Star Island, in 
a boat that crosses daily whenever there are passengers. My companions were the 
two Yankees, who had quite recovered from yesterday's sickness, and were in the 
best of spirits and the utmost activity of mind of which they were capable. 
Never was there such a string of questions as they directed to the 
boatman,--questions that seemed to have no gist, so far as related to any use 
that could be made of the answers. They appear to be very good young men, 
however, well-meaning, and with manners not disagreeable, because their hearts 
are not amiss. Star Island is less than a mile from Appledore. It is the most 
populous island of the group,--has been, for three or four years, an 
incorporated township, and sends a representative to the New Hampshire 
legislature. The number of voters is variously represented as from eighteen to 
twenty-eight. The inhabitants are all, I presume, fishermen. Their houses stand 
in pretty close neighborhood to one another, scattered about without the 
slightest regularity or pretence of a street, there being no wheel-carriages on 
the island. Some of the houses are very comfortable two-story dwellings. I saw 
two or three, I think, with flowers. There are also one or two trees on the 
island. There is a strong odor of fishiness, and the little cove is full of 
mackerel-boats, and other small craft for fishing, in some of which little boys 
of no growth at all were paddling about. Nearly in the centre of this insular 
metropolis is a two-story house, with a flag-staff in the yard. This is the 
hotel.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>On the highest point of Star Island stands the church,--a small, wooden 
structure; and, sitting in its shadow, I found a red-baize-shirted fisherman, 
who seemed quite willing to converse. He said that there was a minister here, 
who was also the schoolmaster; but that he did not keep school just now, 
because his wife was very much out of health. The school-house stood but a 
little way from the meeting-house, and near it was the minister's dwelling; and 
by and by I had a glimpse of the good man himself, in his suit of black, which 
looked in very decent condition at the distance from which I viewed it. His 
clerical air was quite distinguishable, and it was rather curious to see it, 
when everybody else wore red-baize shirts and fishing-boots, and looked of the 
scaly genus. He did not approach me, and I saw him no nearer. I soon grew weary 
of Gosport, and was glad to re&euml;mbark, although I intend to revisit the 
island with Mr. Thaxter, and see more of its peculiarities and inhabitants. I 
saw one old witch-looking woman creeping about with a cane, and stooping down, 
seemingly to gather herbs. On mentioning her to Mr. Thaxter, after my return, 
he said that it was probably &quot;the bearded woman.&quot; I did not observe 
her beard; but very likely she may have had one.</p> 
<p>The larger part of the company at the hotel returned to the mainland 
to-day. There remained behind, however, a Mr. T---- from Newburyport,--a man of 
natural refinement, and a taste for reading that seems to point towards the 
writings of Emerson, Thoreau, and men of that class. I have had a good deal of 
talk with him, and at first doubted whether he might not be a clergyman; but 
Mr. Thaxter tells me that he has made his own way in the world,--was&nbsp;once 
a sailor before the mast, and is now engaged in mercantile pursuits. He looks 
like nothing of this kind, being tall and slender, with very quiet manners, not 
beautiful, though pleasing from the refinement that they indicate. He has 
rather a precise and careful pronunciation, but yet a natural way of talking.
</p> 
<p>* * *</p> 
<p>In the afternoon I walked round a portion of the island that I had not 
previously visited, and in the evening went with Mr. Titcomb to Mr. Thaxter's 
to drink apple-toddy. We found Mrs. Thaxter sitting in a neat little parlor, 
very simply furnished, but in good taste. She is not now, I believe, more than 
eighteen years old, very pretty, and with the manners of a lady,--not prim and 
precise, but with enough of freedom and case. The books on the table were 
&quot;Pre-Raphaelitism,&quot; a tract on spiritual mediums, etc. There were 
several shelves of books on one side of the room, and engravings on the walls. 
Mr. Weiss was there, and I do not know but he is an inmate of Mr. Thaxter's. By 
and by came in Mr. Thaxter's brother, with a young lady whose position I do not 
know,--either a sister or the brother's wife. Anon, too, came in the 
apple-toddy, a very rich and spicy compound; after which we had some glees and 
negro melodies, in which Mr. Thaxter sang a noble bass, and Mrs. Thaxter sang 
like a bird, and Mr. Weiss sang, I suppose, tenor, and the brother took some 
other part, and all were very mirthful and jolly. At about ten o'clock Mr. 
Titcomb and myself took leave, and emerging into the open air, out of that room 
of song, and pretty youthfulness of woman, and gay young men, there was the 
sky, and the three-quarters waning moon, and the old sea moaning all round 
about the island.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
<p><em>Sunday, September</em> 5<em>th.</em>--To-day I have done little or 
nothing except to roam along the shore of the island, and to sit under the 
piazza, talking with Mr. Laighton or some of his half-dozen guests; and about 
an hour before dinner I came up to my room, and took a brief nap. Since dinner 
I have been writing the foregoing journal. I observe that the Fanny Ellsler, 
our passenger and mail boat, has arrived from Portsmouth, and now lies in a 
little cove, moored to the rocky shore, with a flag flying at her main-mast. We 
have been watching her for some hours, but she stopped to fish, and then went 
to some other island, before putting in here. I must go and see what news she 
has brought.</p> 
<p>&quot;What did you fire at?&quot; asked one of the Yankees just now of a 
boy who had been firing a gun. &quot;Nothing,&quot; said the boy. &quot;Did you 
hit it?&quot; rejoined the Yankee.</p> 
<p>The farmer is of a much ruder and rougher mould than his brother,--heavier 
in frame and mind, and far less cultivated. It was on this account, probably, 
that he labored as a farmer, instead of setting up a shop. When it is warm, as 
yesterday, he takes off his coat, and, not minding whether or no his 
shirt-sleeves be soiled, goes in this guise to meals or wherever else,--not 
resuming his coat as long as he is more comfortable without it. His shoulders 
have a stoop, and altogether his air is that of a farmer in repose. His brother 
is handsome, and might have quite the aspect of a smart, comely young man, if 
well dressed.</p> 
<p>This island is said to be haunted by a spectre called &quot;Old Bab.&quot; 
He was one of Captain Kidd's men, and was slain for the protection of the 
treasure. Mr.&nbsp;Laighton said that, before he built his house, nothing would 
have induced the inhabitant of another island to come to this after nightfall. 
The ghost especially haunts the space between the hotel and the cove in front. 
There has, in times past, been great search for the treasure.</p> 
<p>Mr. Thaxter tells me that the women on the island are very timid as to 
venturing on the sea,--more so than the women of the mainland,--and that they 
are easily frightened about their husbands. Very few accidents happen to the 
boats or men,--none, I think, since Mr. Thaxter has been here. They are not an 
enterprising set of people, never liking to make long voyages. Sometimes one of 
them will ship on a voyage to the West Indies, but generally only on coast-wise 
trips, or fishing or mackerel voyages. They have a very strong local 
attachment, and return to die. They are now generally temperate, formerly very 
much the contrary.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><em>September</em> 5<em>th.</em>--A large part of the guests took their 
departure after an early breakfast this morning, including Mr. Titcomb, Mr. 
Weiss, the two Yankees, and Mr. Thaxter,--who, however, went as skipper or 
supercargo, and will return with the boat. I have been fishing for cunners off 
the rocks, but with intolerably poor success. There is nothing so dispiriting 
as poor fishing, and I spend most of the time with my head on my hands, looking 
at the sea breaking against the rocks, shagged around the bases with seaweed. 
It is a sunny forenoon, with a cool breeze from the south-west. The mackerel 
craft are in the offing. Mr. Laighton says that the Spy (the boat which went to 
the mainland this morning) is now on her return with&nbsp;all her colors set; 
and he thinks that Pierce is on board, he having sent Mr. Thaxter to invite him 
to come in this boat.</p> 
<p>Pierce arrived before dinner in the Spy, accompanied by Judge Upham and his 
brother and their wives, his own wife, Mr. Furness, and three young ladies. 
After dinner some of the gentlemen crossed over to Gosport, where we visited 
the old graveyard, in which were monuments to Rev. Mr. Tucke (died 1773, after 
forty years' settlement) and to another and later minister of the island. They 
were of red freestone, lying horizontally on piles of the granite fragments, 
such as are scattered all about. There were other graves, marked by the rudest 
shapes of stones at head and foot. And so many stones protruded from the 
ground, that it was wonderful how space and depth enough was found between them 
to cover the dead. We went to the house of the town clerk of Gosport (a drunken 
fisherman, Joe Caswell by name), and there found the town records, commencing 
in 1732, in a beautiful style of penmanship. They. are imperfect, the township 
having been broken up, probably at the time of the Revolution. Caswell, being 
very drunk, immediately put in a petition to Pierce to build a sea-mole for the 
protection of the navigation of the island when he should be President. He was 
dressed in the ordinary fisherman's style,--red-baize shirt, trousers tucked 
into large boots, which, as he had just come ashore, were wet with salt water.
</p> 
<p>He led us down to the shore of the island, towards the east, and showed us 
Betty Moody's Hole. This Betty Moody was a woman of the island in old times. 
The Indians came off on a depredating excursion, and she fled from them with a 
child, and hid herself in&nbsp;this hole, which is formed by several great 
rocks being lodged so as to cover one of the fissures which are common along 
these shores. I crept into the hole, which is somewhat difficult of access, 
long, low, and narrow, and might well enough be a hiding-place. The child, or 
children, began to cry; and Betty, fearful of discovery, murdered them to save 
herself. Joe Caswell did not tell the latter part of the story, but Mr. Thaxter 
did.</p> 
<p>Not far from the spot there is a point of rocks extending out farther into 
the ocean than the rest of the island. Some four or five years ago there was a 
young woman residing at Gosport in the capacity of school-teacher. She was of a 
romantic turn, and used to go and sit on this point of rock to view the waves. 
One day, when the wind was high, and the surf raging against the rocks, a great 
wave struck her, as she sat on the edge, and seemed to deprive her of sense; 
another wave, or the reflex of the same one, carried her off into the sea, and 
she was seen no more. This happened, I think, in 1846.</p> 
<p>Passing a rock near the centre of the island, which rose from the soil 
about breast-high, and appeared to have been split asunder, with an 
incalculably aged and moss-grown fissure, the surfaces of which, however, 
precisely suited each other, Mr. Hatch mentioned that there was an idea among 
the people, with regard to rocks thus split, that they were rent asunder at the 
time of the Crucifixion. Judge Upham observed that this superstition was common 
in all parts of the country.</p> 
<p>Mr. Hatch said that he was professionally consulted the other day, by a man 
who had been digging for buried treasure at Dover Point, up the Piscataqua&nbsp;
River; and, while he and his companions were thus engaged, the owner of the 
land came upon them, and compelled Hatch's client to give him a note for a sum 
of money. The object was to inquire whether this note was obligatory. Hatch 
says that there are a hundred people now resident in Portsmouth, who, at one 
time or another, have dug for treasure. The process is, in the first place, to 
find out the site of the treasure by the divining-rod. A circle is then 
described with the steel rod about the spot, and a man walks around within its 
verge, reading the Bible, to keep off the evil spirit while his companions dig. 
If a word is spoken, the whole business is a failure. Once, the person who told 
him the story reached the lid of the chest, so that the spades plainly scraped 
upon it, when one of the men spoke, and the chest immediately moved sideways 
into the earth. Another time, when he was reading the Bible within the circle, 
a creature like a white horse, but immoderately large, came from a distance 
towards the circle, looked at him, and then began to graze about the spot. He 
saw the motion of the jaws, but heard no sound of champing. His companions saw 
the gigantic horse precisely as he did, only to them it appeared bay instead of 
white.</p> 
<p>The islanders stared with great curiosity at Pierce. One pretty young woman 
appeared inclined to engross him entirely to herself.</p> 
<p>There is a bowling-alley on the island, at which some of the young 
fishermen were rolling.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><em>September</em> 7<em>th.</em>--. . . I have made no exploration to-day, 
except a walk with the guests in the morning, but have lounged about the piazza 
and veranda. It&nbsp;has been a calm, warm, sunny day, the sea slumbering 
against the shores, and now and then breaking into white foam.</p> 
<p>The surface of the island is plentifully overgrown with whortleberry and 
bayberry bushes. The sheep cut down the former, so that few berries are 
produced; the latter gives a pleasant fragrance when pressed in the hand. The 
island is one great ledge of rock, four hundred acres in extent, with a little 
soil thrown scantily over it; but the bare rock everywhere emerging, not only 
in points, but still more in flat surfaces. The only trees, I think, are two 
that Mr. Laighton has been trying to raise in front of the hotel, the taller of 
which looks scarcely so much as ten feet high. It is now about sunset, and the 
Fanny, with the mail, is just arrived at the moorings. So still is it, that the 
sounds on board (as of throwing oars into a small boat) are distinctly heard, 
though a quarter of a mile off. She has the Stars and Stripes flying at the 
main-mast. There appear to be no passengers.</p> 
<p>The only reptile on the island is a very vivid and beautiful green snake, 
which is exceedingly abundant. Yesterday, while catching grasshoppers for 
fish-bait, I nearly griped one in my hand; indeed, I rather think I did gripe 
it. The snake was as much startled as myself, and, in its fright, stood an 
instant on its tail, before it recovered presence of mind to glide away. These 
snakes are quite harmless.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><em>September</em> 8<em>th.</em>--Last evening we could hear the roaring of 
the beaches at Hampton and Rye, nine miles off. The surf likewise swelled 
against the rocky shores of the island, though there was little or no wind, 
and, except for the swell, the surface was&nbsp;smooth. The sheep bleated 
loudly; and all these tokens, according to Mr. Laighton, foreboded a storm to 
windward. This morning, nevertheless, there were no further signs of it; it is 
sunny and calm, or only the slightest breeze from the westward; a haze sleeping 
along the shore, betokening a warm day; the surface of the sea streaked with 
smoothness, and gentle ruffles of wind. It has been the hottest day that I have 
known here, and probably one of the hottest of the season ashore; and the land 
is now imperceptible in the haze.</p> 
<p>Smith's monument is about seven feet high, and probably ten or twelve in 
diameter at its base. It is a cairn, or mere heap of stones, thrown together as 
they came to hand, though with some selection of large and flat ones towards 
the base, and with smaller ones thrown in. At the foundation, there are large 
rocks, naturally imbedded in the earth. I see no reason to disbelieve that a 
part of this monument may have been erected by Captain Smith, although 
subsequent visitors may have added to it. Laighton says it is known to have 
stood upwards of a hundred years. It is a work of considerable labor, and would 
more likely have been erected by one who supposed himself the first discoverer 
of the island than by anybody afterwards for mere amusement. I observed in some 
places, towards the base, that the lichens had grown from one stone to another; 
and there is nothing in the appearance of the monument that controverts the 
supposition of its antiquity. It is an irregular circle, somewhat decreasing 
towards the top. Few of the stones, except at the base, are bigger than a man 
could easily lift,--many of them are not more than a foot across. It stands 
towards the southern part of the&nbsp;island; and all the other islands are 
visible from it, Smutty Nose, Star Island, and White Island,--on which is the 
light-house,--much of Laighton's island (the proper name of which is Hog, 
though latterly called Appledore), and Duck Island, which looks like a mere 
reef of rocks, and about a mile farther into the ocean, easterly of Hog Island.
</p> 
<p>Laighton's Hotel, together with the house in which his son-in-law resides, 
which was likewise built by Laighton, and stands about fifty yards from the 
hotel, occupies the middle of a shallow valley, which passes though the island 
from east to west. Looking from the veranda, you have the ocean opening towards 
the east, and the bay towards Rye Beach and Portsmouth on the west. In the same 
storm that overthrew Minot's Light, a year or two ago, a great wave passed 
entirely through this valley; and Laighton describes it, when it came in from 
the sea, as toppling over to the height of the cupola of his hotel. It roared 
and whitened though, from sea to sea, twenty feet abreast, rolling along huge 
rocks in its passage. It passed beneath his veranda, which stands on posts, and 
probably filled the valley completely. Would I had been here to see!</p> 
<p>The day has been exceedingly hot. Since dinner, the Spy has arrived from 
Portsmouth, with a party of half a dozen or more men and women and children, 
apparently from the interior of New Hampshire. I am rather sorry to receive 
these strangers into the quiet life that we are leading here; for we had grown 
quite to feel ourselves at home, and the two young ladies, Mr. Thaxter, his 
wife and sister, and myself, met at meal-times like one family. The young 
ladies gathered shells, arranged them, laughed gently, sang,&nbsp;and did other 
pretty things in a young-lady-like way. These new-comers are people of uncouth 
voices and loud laughter, and behave themselves as if they were trying to turn 
their expedition to as much account as possible in the way of enjoyment.</p> 
<p>John's boat, the regular passenger-boat, is now coming in, and probably 
brings the mail.</p> 
<p>In the afternoon, while some of the new-comers were fishing off the rocks, 
west of the hotel, a shark came close in shore. Hearing their outcries, I 
looked out of my chamber window, and saw the dorsal fin and the fluke of his 
tail stuck up out of the water, as he moved to and fro. He must have been eight 
or ten feet long. He had probably followed the small fish into the bay, and got 
bewildered, and, at one time, he was almost aground.</p> 
<p>Oscar, Mr. Laighton's son, ran down with a gun, and fired at the shark, 
which was then not more than ten yards from the shore. He aimed, according to 
his father's directions, just below the junction of the dorsal fin with the 
body; but the gun was loaded only with shot, and seemed to produce no effect. 
Oscar had another shot at him afterwards; the shark floundered a little in the 
water, but finally got off and disappeared, probably without very serious 
damage. He came so near the shore that he might have been touched with a 
boat-hook.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><em>September</em> 9<em>th.</em>--Mr. Thaxter rowed me this morning, in his 
dory, to White Island, on which is the lighthouse. There was scarcely a breath 
of air, and a perfectly calm sea; an intensely hot sunshine, with a little 
haze, so that the horizon was indistinct. Here and there sail-boats sleeping on 
the water, or moving&nbsp;almost imperceptibly over it. The lighthouse island 
would be difficult of access in a rough sea, the shore being so rocky. On 
landing, we found the keeper peeling his harvest of onions, which he had 
gathered prematurely, because the insects were eating them. His little patch of 
garden seemed to be a strange kind of soil, as like marine mud as anything; but 
he had a fair crop of marrow squashes, though injured, as he said, by the last 
storm; and there were cabbages and a few turnips. I recollect no other garden 
vegetables. The grass grows pretty luxuriantly, and looked very green where 
there was any soil; but he kept no cow, nor even a pig nor a hen. His house 
stands close by the garden,--a small stone building, with peaked roof, and 
whitewashed. The lighthouse stands on a ledge of rock, with a gulley between, 
and there is a long covered way, triangular in shape, connecting his residence 
with it. We ascended into the lantern, which is eighty-seven feet high. It is a 
revolving light, with several great illuminators of copper silvered, and 
colored lamp-glasses. Looking downward, we had the island displayed as on a 
chart, with its little bays, its isthmus of shingly beach connecting two parts 
of the island, and overflowed at high tide; its sunken rocks about it, 
indicated by the swell, or slightly breaking surf. The keeper of the 
light-house was formerly a writing-master. He has a sneaking kind of look, and 
does not bear a very high character among his neighbors. Since he kept the 
light, he has lost two wives,--the first a young creature whom he used to leave 
alone upon this desolate rock, and the gloom and terror of the situation were 
probably the cause of her death. The second wife, experiencing the same kind of 
treatment, ran away from him, and&nbsp;returned to her friends. He pretends to 
be religious, but drinks. About a year ago he attempted to row out alone from 
Portsmouth. There was a head wind and head tide, and he would have inevitably 
drifted out to sea, if Mr. Thaxter had not saved him.</p> 
<p>While we were standing in his garden-patch, I heard a woman's voice inside 
the dwelling, but know not whose it was. A light-house nine miles from shore 
would be a delightful place for a new-married couple to spend their honeymoon, 
or their whole first year.</p> 
<p>On our way back we landed at another island called Londoner's Rock, or some 
such name. It has but little soil. As we approached it, a large bird flew away. 
Mr. Thaxter took it to be a gannet; and, while walking over the island, an owl 
started up from among the rocks near us, and flew away, apparently uncertain of 
its course. It was a brown owl, but Mr. Thaxter says that there are beautiful 
white owls, which spend the winter here, and feed upon rats. These are very 
abundant, and live amidst the rocks,--probably having been brought hither by 
vessels.</p> 
<p>The water to-day was not so transparent as sometimes, but had a slight haze 
diffused though it, somewhat like that of the atmosphere.</p> 
<p>The passengers brought by the Spy, yesterday, still remain with us. They 
consist of country traders, a country doctor, and such sorts of people, rude, 
shrewd, and simple, and well-behaved enough; wondering at sharks, and equally 
at lobsters; sitting down to table with their coats off; helping themselves out 
of the dish with their own forks; taking pudding on the plates off which they 
have eaten meat. People at just this stage of manners are more disagreeable 
than at any other stage. They are aware of some decencies,&nbsp;but not so 
deeply aware as to make them a matter of conscience. They may be heard talking 
of the financial affairs of the expedition, reckoning what money each has paid. 
One offers to pay another three or four cents, which the latter has overpaid. 
&quot;It's of no consequence, sir,&quot; says his friend, with a tone of 
conscious liberality, &quot;that's near enough.&quot; This is a most 
tremendously hot day.</p> 
<p>There is a young lady staying at the hotel, afflicted with what her friends 
call erysipelas, but which is probably scrofula. She seems unable to walk, or 
sit up; but every pleasant day, about the middle of the forenoon, she is 
dragged out beneath the veranda, on a sofa. To-day she has been there until 
late in the decline of the afternoon. It is a delightful place, where the 
breezes stir, if any are in motion. The young girls, her sisters or cousins, 
and Mr. Thaxter's sister, sat round her, babbling cheerfully, and singing; and 
they were so merry that it did not seem as if there could be an incurably sick 
one in the midst of them.</p> 
<p>The Spy came to-day, with more passengers of no particular character. She 
still remains off the landing, moored, with her sails in the wind.</p> 
<p>The mail arrived to-day, but nothing for me.</p> 
<p>Close by the veranda, at the end of the hotel, is drawn up a large boat, of 
ten or twelve tons, which got injured in some gale, and probably will remain 
there for years to decay, and be a picturesque and characteristic object.</p> 
<p>The Spy has been lying in the broad track of golden light, thrown by the 
sun, far down towards the horizon, over the rippling water, her sails throwing 
distinct, dark shadows over the brightness. She has&nbsp;now got under way, and 
set sail on a northwest course for Portsmouth; carrying off, I believe, all the 
passengers she brought to-day.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><em>September</em> 10<em>th.</em>--Here is another beautiful morning, with 
the sun dimpling in the early sunshine. Four sail-boats are in sight, 
motionless on the sea, with the whiteness of their sails reflected in it. The 
heat-haze sleeps along the shore, though not so as quite to hide it, and there 
is the promise of another very warm day. As yet, however, the air is cool and 
refreshing. Around the island, there is the little ruffle of a breeze; but 
where the sail-boats are, a mile or more off, the sea is perfectly calm. The 
crickets sing, and I hear the chirping of birds besides.</p> 
<p>At the base of the light-house yesterday, we saw the wings and feathers of 
a decayed little bird, and Mr. Thaxter said they often flew against the lantern 
with such force as to kill themselves, and that large quantities of them might 
be picked up. How came these little birds out of their nests at night? Why 
should they meet destruction from the radiance that proves the salvation of 
other beings?</p> 
<p>Mr. Thaxter had once a man living with him who had seen &quot;Old 
Bab,&quot; the ghost. He met him between the hotel and the sea, and describes 
him as dressed in a sort of frock, and with a very dreadful countenance.</p> 
<p>Two or three years ago, the crew of a wrecked vessel, a brigantine, wrecked 
near Boon Island, landed on Hog Island of a winter night, and found shelter in 
the hotel. It was from the eastward. There were six or seven men, with the mate 
and captain. It was midnight when they got ashore. The common sailors, as soon 
as they were physically comfortable, seemed to be&nbsp;perfectly at ease. The 
captain walked the floor, bemoaning himself for a silver watch which he had 
lost; the mate, being the only married man, talked about his Eunice. They all 
told their dreams of the preceding night, and saw in them prognostics of the 
misfortune.</p> 
<p>There is now a breeze, the blue ruffle of which seems to reach almost 
across to the mainland, yet with streaks of calm; and, in one place, the glassy 
surface of a lake of calmness, amidst the surrounding commotion.</p> 
<p>The wind, in the early morning, was from the west, and the aspect of the 
sky seemed to promise a warm and sunny day. But all at once, soon after 
breakfast, the wind shifted round to the eastward; and great volumes of fog, 
almost as dense as cannon-smoke, came sweeping from the eastern ocean, through 
the valley, and past the house. It soon covered the whole sea, and the whole 
island, beyond a verge of a few hundred yards. The chilliness was not so great 
as accompanies a change of wind on the mainland. We had been watching a large 
ship that was slowly making her way between us and the land towards Portsmouth. 
This was now hidden. The breeze is still very moderate; but the boat, moored 
near the shore, rides with a considerable motion, as if the sea were getting up.
</p> 
<p>Mr. Laighton says that the artist who adorned Trinity Church, in New York, 
with sculpture wanted some real wings from which to imitate the wings of 
cherubim. Mr. Thaxter carried him the wings of the white owl that winters here 
at the Shoals, together with those of some other bird; and the artist gave his 
cherubim the wings of an owl.</p> 
<p>This morning there have been two boat-loads of&nbsp;visitors from Rye. They 
merely made a flying call, and took to their boats again,--a disagreeable and 
impertinent kind of people.</p> 
<p>The Spy arrived before dinner, with several passengers. After dinner, came 
the Fanny, bringing, among other freight, a large basket of delicious pears to 
me, together with a note from Mr. B. B. Titcomb. He is certainly a man of 
excellent taste and admirable behavior. I sent a plateful of pears to the room 
of each guest now in the hotel, kept a dozen for myself, and gave the balance 
to Mr. Laighton.</p> 
<p>The two Portsmouth young ladies returned in the Spy. I had grown accustomed 
to their presence, and rather liked them; one of them being gay and rather 
noisy, and the other quiet and gentle. As to new-comers, I feel rather a 
distaste to them; and so, I find, does Mr. Laighton,--a rather singular 
sentiment for a hotel-keeper to entertain towards his guests. However, he 
treats them very hospitably when once within his doors.</p> 
<p>The sky is overcast, and, about the time the Spy and the Fanny sailed, 
there were a few drops of rain. The wind, at that time, was strong enough to 
raise white-caps to the eastward of the island, and there was good hope of a 
storm. Now, however, the wind has subsided, and the weather-seers know not what 
to forebode.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><em>September</em> 11<em>th.</em>--The wind shifted and veered about, 
towards the close of yesterday, and later it was almost calm, after blowing 
gently from the northwest,--notwithstanding which it rained. There being a 
mistiness in the air, we could see the gleam of the light-house upon the mist 
above it, although the&nbsp;light-house itself was hidden by the highest point 
of this island, or by our being in a valley. As we sat under the piazza in the 
evening, we saw the light from on board some vessel move slowly through the 
distant obscurity,--so slowly that we were only sensible of its progress by 
forgetting it and looking again. The plash and murmur of the waves around the 
island were soothingly audible. It was not unpleasantly cold, and Mr. Laighton, 
Mr. Thaxter, and myself sat under the piazza till long after dark; the former 
at a little distance, occasionally smoking his pipe, and Mr. Thaxter and I 
talking about poets and the stage. The latter is an odd subject to be discussed 
in this stern and wild scene, which has precisely the same characteristics now 
as two hundred years ago. The mosquitoes were very abundant last night, and 
they are certainly hardier race than their inland brethren.</p> 
<p>This morning there is a sullen sky, with scarcely any breeze. The clouds 
throw shadows of varied darkness upon the sea. I know not which way the wind 
is; but the aspect of things seems to portend a calm drizzle as much as 
anything else.</p> 
<p>About eleven o'clock, Mr. Thaxter took me over to Smutty Nose in his dory. 
A sloop from the eastward, laden with laths, bark, and other lumber, and a few 
barrels of mackerel, filled yesterday, and was left by her skipper and crew. 
All the morning we have seen boats picking up her deck-load, which was 
scattered over the sea, and along the shores of the islands. The skipper and 
his three men got into Smutty Nose in the boat; and the sloop was afterwards 
boarded by the Smutty Noses and brought into that island. We saw her lying at 
the pier,--a black, ugly, rotten old thing, with the water half-way over her 
decks. The wonder&nbsp;was, how she swam so long. The skipper, a man of about 
thirty-five or forty, in a blue pilot-cloth overcoat, and a rusty, high-crowned 
hat jammed down over his brow, looked very forlorn; while the islanders were 
grouped about, indolently enjoying the matter.</p> 
<p>I walked with Mr. Thaxter over the island, and saw first the graves of the 
Spaniards. They were wrecked on this island a hundred years ago, and lie buried 
in a range about thirty feet in length, to the number of sixteen, with rough, 
moss-grown pieces of granite on each side of this common grave. Near this spot, 
yet somewhat removed, so as not to be confounded with it, are other individual 
graves, chiefly of the Haley family, who were once possessors of the island. 
These have slate gravestones. There is also, within a small enclosure of rough 
pine boards, a white marble gravestone, in memory of a young man named Bekker, 
son of the person who now keeps the hotel on Smutty Nose. He was buried, Mr. 
Thaxter says, notwithstanding his marble monument, in a rude pine box, which he 
himself helped to make.</p> 
<p>We walked to the farthest point of the island, and I have never seen a more 
dismal place than it was on this sunless and east-windy day, being the farthest 
point out into the melancholy sea which was in no very agreeable mood, and 
roared sullenly against the wilderness of rocks. One mass of rock, more than 
twelve feet square, was thrown up out of the sea in a storm, not many years 
since, and now lies athwart-wise, never to be moved unless another omnipotent 
wave shall give it another toss. On shore, such a rock would be a landmark for 
centuries. It is inconceivable how a sufficient mass of water could be&nbsp;
brought to bear on this ponderous mass; but, not improbably, all the fragments 
piled upon one another round these islands have thus been flung to and fro at 
one time or another.</p> 
<p>There is considerable land that would serve tolerably for pasture on Smutty 
Nose, and here and there a little enclosure of richer grass, built round with a 
strong stone-wall. The same kind of enclosure is prevalent on Star 
Island,--each small proprietor fencing off his little bit of tillage or grass. 
Wild-flowers are abundant and various on these islands; the bayberry-bush is 
plentiful on Smutty Nose, and makes the hand that crushes it fragrant.</p> 
<p>The hotel is kept by a Prussian, an old soldier, who fought at the Battle 
of Waterloo. We saw him in the barn,--a gray, heavy, round-skulled old fellow, 
troubled with deafness. The skipper of the wrecked sloop had, apparently, just 
been taking a drop of comfort, but still seemed downcast. He took passage in a 
fishing-vessel, the Wave, of Kittery, for Portsmouth; and I know not why, but 
there was something that made me smile in his grim and gloomy look, his rusty, 
jammed hat, his rough and grisly beard, and in his mode of chewing tobacco, 
with much action of the jaws, getting out the juice as largely as possible, as 
men always do when disturbed in mind. I looked at him earnestly, and was 
conscious of something that marked him out from among the careless islanders 
around him. Being as much discomposed as it was possible for him to be, his 
feelings individualized the man and magnetized the observer. When he got aboard 
the fishing-vessel, he seemed not entirely at his ease, being accustomed to 
command and work amongst his own little crew, and now having nothing&nbsp;to 
do. Nevertheless, unconsciously perhaps, he lent a hand to whatever was going 
on, and yet had a kind of strangeness about him. As the Wave set sail, we were 
just starting in our dory, and a young fellow, an acquaintance of Mr. Thaxter, 
proposed to take us in tow; so we were dragged along at her stern very rapidly, 
and with a whitening wake, until we came off Hog Island. Then the dory was cast 
loose, and Mr. Thaxter rowed ashore against a head sea.</p> 
<p>The day is still overcast, and the wind is from the eastward; but it does 
not increase, and the sun appears occasionally on the point of shining out. A 
boat--the Fanny, I suppose, from Portsmouth--has just come to her moorings in 
front of the hotel. A sail-boat has put off from her, with a passenger in the 
stern. Pray God she bring me a letter with good news from home; for I begin to 
feel as if I had been long enough away.</p> 
<p>There is a bowling-alley on Smutty Nose, at which some of the 
Star-Islanders were playing, when we were there. I saw only two dwelling-houses 
besides the hotel. Connected with Smutty Nose, by a stone-wall there is another 
little bit of island, called Malaga. Both are the property of Mr. Laighton.</p> 
<p>Mr. Laighton says that the Spanish wreck occurred forty-seven years ago, 
instead of a hundred. Some of the dead bodies were found on Malaga, others on 
various parts of the next island. One or two had crept to a stone-wall that 
traverses Smutty Nose, but were unable to get over it. One was found among the 
bushes the next summer. Mr. Haley had been buried at his own expense.</p> 
<p>The skipper of the wrecked sloop, yesterday, was unwilling to go to 
Portsmouth until he was shaved,&nbsp;--his beard being of several days' growth. 
It seems to be the impulse of people under misfortune to put on their best 
clothes, and attend to the decencies of life.</p> 
<p>The Fanny brought a passenger,--a thin, stiff, black-haired young man, who 
enters his name as Mr. Tufts, from Charlestown. He, and a country trader, his 
wife, sister, and two children (all of whom have been here several days), are 
now the only guests besides myself.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><em>September</em> 12<em>th.</em>--The night set in sullen and gloomy, and 
morning has dawned in pretty much the same way. The wind, however, seems rising 
somewhat, and grumbles past the angle of the house. Perhaps we shall see a 
storm yet from the eastward; and, having the whole sweep of the broad Atlantic 
between here and Ireland, I do not see why it should not be fully equal to a 
storm at sea.</p> 
<p>It has been raining more or less all the forenoon, and now, at twelve 
o'clock, blows, as Mr. Laighton says, &quot;half a gale&quot; from the 
southeast. Through the opening of our shallow valley, towards the east, there 
is the prospect of a tumbling sea, with hundreds of white-caps chasing one 
another over it. In front of the hotel, being to leeward, the water near the 
shore is but slightly ruffled; but farther the sea is agitated, and the surf 
breaks over Square Rock. All around the horizon, landward as well as seaward, 
the view is shut in by a mist. Sometimes I have a dim sense of the continent 
beyond, but no more distinct than the thought of the other world to the 
unenlightened soul. The sheep bleat in their desolate pasture. The wind shakes 
the house. A loon, seeking, I suppose, some&nbsp;quieter resting-place than on 
the troubled waves, was seen swimming just now in the cove not more than a 
hundred yards from the hotel. Judging by the pother which this &quot;half a 
gale &quot;makes with the sea, it must have been a terrific time, indeed, when 
that great wave rushed and roared across the islands.</p> 
<p>Since dinner, I have been to the eastern shore to look at the sea. It is a 
wild spectacle, but still, I suppose, lacks an infinite deal of being a storm. 
Outside of this island there is a long and low one (or two in a line), looking 
more like a reef of rocks than an island, and at the distance of a mile or 
more. There the surf and spray break gallantly,--white-sheeted forms rising up 
all at once, and hovering a moment in the air. Spots which, in calm times, are 
not discernible from the rest of the ocean, now are converted into white, foamy 
breakers. The swell of the waves against our shore makes a snowy depth, tinged 
with green, for many feet back from the shore. The longer waves swell, overtop, 
and rush upon the rocks; and, when they return, the waters pour back in a 
cascade. Against the outer points of Smutty Nose and Star Island, there is a 
higher surf than here; because, the wind being from the southeast, these 
islands receive it first, and form a partial barrier in respect to this. While 
I looked, there was moisture in the air, and occasional spats of rain. The 
uneven places in the rocks were full of the fallen rain.</p> 
<p>It is quite impossible to give an idea of these rocky shores,--how 
confusedly they are tossed together, lying in all directions; what solid 
ledges, what great fragments thrown out from the rest. Often the rocks are 
broken, square and angular, so as to form a kind of staircase; though, for the 
most part, such as would require a giant stride to ascend them.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Sometimes a black trap-rock runs through the bed of granite; sometimes the 
sea has eaten this away, leaving a long, irregular fissure. In some places, 
owing to the same cause perhaps, there is a great hollow place excavated into 
the ledge, and forming a harbor, into which the sea flows; and, while there is 
foam and fury at the entrance, it is comparatively calm within. Some parts of 
the crag are as much as fifty feet of perpendicular height, down which you look 
over a bare and smooth descent, at the base of which is a shaggy margin of 
seaweed. But it is vain to try to express this confusion. As much as anything 
else, it seems as if some of the massive materials of the world remained 
superfluous, after the Creator had finished, and were carelessly thrown down 
here, where the millionth part of them emerge from the sea, and in the course 
of thousands of years have become partially bestrewn with a little soil.</p> 
<p>The wind has changed to southwest, and blows pretty freshly. The sun shone 
before it set; and the mist, which all day has overhung the land, now takes the 
aspect of a cloud,--drawing a thin veil between us and the shore, and rising 
above it. In our own atmosphere there is no fog nor mist.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><em>September</em> 13<em>th.</em>--I spent last evening, as well as part of 
the evening before, at Mr. Thaxter's. It is certainly a romantic incident to 
find such a young man on this lonely island; his marriage with the pretty 
Miranda is true romance. In our talk we have glanced over many matters, and, 
among the rest, that of the stage, to prepare himself for which was his first 
motive in coming hither. He appears quite to have given up any dreams of that 
kind now. What he will&nbsp;do on returning to the world, as his purpose is, I 
cannot imagine; but, no doubt, though all their remaining life, both he and she 
will look back to this rocky ledge, with its handful of soil, as to a Paradise.
</p> 
<p>Last evening we (Mr., Mrs., and Miss Thaxter) sat and talked of ghosts and 
kindred subjects; and they told me of the appearance of a little old woman in a 
striped gown, that had come into that house a few months ago. She was seen by 
nobody but an Irish nurse, who spoke to her, but received no answer. The little 
woman drew her chair up towards the fire, and stretched out her feet to warm 
them. By and by the nurse, who suspected nothing of her ghostly character, went 
to get a pail of water; and, when she came back, the little woman was not 
there. It being known precisely how many and what people were on the island, 
and that no such little woman was among them, the fact of her being a ghost is 
incontestable. I taught them how to discover the hidden sentiments of letters 
by suspending a gold ring over them. Ordinarily, since I have been here, we 
have spent the evening under the piazza, where Mr. Laighton sits to take the 
air. He seems to avoid the within-doors whenever he can. So there he sits in 
the sea-breezes, when inland people are probably drawing their chairs to the 
fire-side; and there I sit with him,--not keeping up a continual flow of talk, 
but each speaking as any wisdom happens to come into his mind.</p> 
<p>The wind, this morning, is from the northwestward, rather brisk, but not 
very strong. There is a scattering of clouds about the sky; but the atmosphere 
is singularly clear, and we can see several hills of the interior, the 
cloud-like White Mountains, and, along the shore, the long white beaches and 
the dotted&nbsp;dwellings, with great distinctness. Many small vessels spread 
their wings, and go seaward.</p> 
<p>I have been rambling over the southern part of the island, and looking at 
the traces of habitations there. There are several enclosures,--the largest, 
perhaps, thirty yards square,--surrounded with a rough stone-wall of very mossy 
antiquity, built originally broad and strong, two or three large stones in 
width, and piled up breast-high or more, and taking advantage of the extending 
ledge to make it higher. Within this enclosure there is almost a clear space of 
soil, which was formerly, no doubt, cultivated as a garden, but is now close 
cropt by the sheep and cattle, except where it produces thistles, or the 
poisonous weed called mercury, which seems to love these old walls, and to rot 
itself in or near them. These walls are truly venerable, gray, and mossy; and 
you see at once that the hands that piled the stones must have been long ago 
turned to dust. Close by the enclosure is the hollow of an old cellar, with 
rocks tumbled into it, but the layers of stone at the side still to be traced, 
and bricks, broken or with rounded edges, scattered about, and perhaps pieces 
of lime; and weeds and grass growing about the whole. Several such sites of 
former human homes may be seen there, none of which can possibly be later than 
the Revolution, and probably they are as old as the settlement of the island. 
The site has Smutty Nose and Star opposite, with a road (that is, a water-road) 
between, varying from half a mile to a mile. Duck Island is also seen on the 
left; and, on the right, the shore of the mainland. Behind, the rising ground 
intercepts the view. Smith's monument is visible. I do not see where the 
inhabitants could have kept their boats, unless in the chasms worn by the sea 
into the rocks.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>One of these chasms has a spring of fresh water in the gravelly base, down 
to which the sea has worn out. The chasm has perpendicular, though irregular, 
sides, which the waves have chiselled out very square. Its width varies from 
ten to twenty feet, widest towards the sea; and on the shelves, up and down the 
sides, some soil has been here and there accumulated, on which grow grass and 
wild-flowers,--such as goldenrod, now in bloom, and raspberry-bushes, the fruit 
of which I found ripe,--the whole making large parts of the sides of the chasm 
green, its verdure overhanging the strip of sea that dashes and foams into the 
hollow. Sea-weed, besides what grows upon and shags the submerged rocks, is 
tossed into the harbor, together with stray pieces of wood, chips, 
barrel-staves, or (as to-day) an entire barrel, or whatever else the sea 
happens to have on hand. The water rakes to and fro over the pebbles at the 
bottom of the chasm, drawing back, and leaving much of it bare, then rushing 
up, with more or less of foam and fury, according to the force and direction of 
the wind; though, owing to the protection of the adjacent islands, it can never 
have a gale blowing right into its mouth. The spring is situated so far down 
the chasm, that, at half or two thirds tide, it is covered by the sea. Twenty 
minutes after the retiring of the tide suffices to restore to it its wonted 
freshness.</p> 
<p>In another chasm, very much like the one here described, I saw a niche in 
the rock, about tall enough for a person of moderate stature to stand upright. 
It had a triangular floor and a top, and was just the place to hold the rudest 
statue that ever a savage made.</p> 
<p>Many of the ledges on the island have yellow moss or lichens spread on them 
in large patches. The moss of those stone walls does really look very old.&nbsp;
</p> 
<p>&quot;Old Bab,&quot; the ghost, has a ring round his neck, and is supposed 
either to have been hung or to have had his throat cut, but he steadfastly 
declines telling the mode of his death. There is a luminous appearance about 
him as he walks, and his face is pale and very dreadful.</p> 
<p>The Fanny arrived this forenoon, and sailed again before dinner. She 
brought, as passenger, a Mr. Balch, brother to the country trader who has been 
spending a few days here. On her return, she has swept the islands of all the 
non-residents except myself. The wind being ahead, and pretty strong, she will 
have to beat up, and the voyage will be anything but agreeable. The spray flew 
before her bows, and doubtless gave the passengers all a thorough wetting 
within the first half-hour.</p> 
<p>The view of Star Island or Gosport from the north is picturesque,--the 
village, or group of houses, being gathered pretty closely together in the 
centre of the island, with some green about them; and above all the other 
edifices, wholly displayed, stands the little stone church, with its tower and 
belfry. On the right is White Island, with the light-house; to the right of 
that, and a little to the northward, Londoner's Rock, where, perhaps, of old, 
some London ship was wrecked. To the left of Star Island, and nearer Hog, or 
Appledore, is Smutty Nose. Pour the blue sea about these islets, and let the 
surf whiten and steal up from their points, and from the reefs about them 
(which latter whiten for an instant, and then are lost in the whelming and 
eddying depths), the northwest-wind the while raising thousands of white-caps, 
and the evening sun shining solemnly over the expanse,--and it is a stern and 
lovely scene.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The valleys that intersect, or partially intersect, the island are a 
remarkable feature. They appear to be of the same formation as the fissures in 
the rocks, but, as they extend farther from the sea, they accumulate a little 
soil along the irregular sides, and so become green and shagged with bushes, 
though with the rock everywhere thrusting itself through. The old people of the 
isles say that their fathers could remember when the sea, at high tide, flowed 
quite through the valley in which the hotel stands, and that boats used to 
pass. Afterwards it was a standing pond; then a morass, with cat-tail flags 
growing in it. It has filled up, so far as it is filled, by the soil being 
washed down from the higher ground on each side. The storms, meanwhile, have 
tossed up the shingle and paving-stones at each end of the valley, so as to 
form a barrier against the passage of any but such mighty waves as that which 
thundered through a year or two ago.</p> 
<p>The old inhabitants lived in the centre or towards the south of the island, 
and avoided the north and east because the latter were so much bleaker in 
winter. They could moor their boats in the road, between Smutty Nose and Hog, 
but could not draw them up. Mr. Laighton found traces of old dwellings in the 
vicinity of the hotel, and it is supposed that the principal part of the 
population was on this island. I spent the evening at Mr. Thaxter's, and we 
drank a glass of his 1820 Scheidam. The northwest-wind was high at ten o'clock, 
when I came home, the tide full, and the murmur of the waves broad and deep.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><em>September</em> 14<em>th.</em>--Another of the brightest of sunny 
mornings. The wind is not nearly so high as last night, but it is apparently 
still from the&nbsp;north-west, and serves to make the sea look very blue and 
cold. The atmosphere is so transparent that objects seem perfectly distinct 
along the mainland. To-day I must be in Portsmouth; to-morrow, at home. A brisk 
west or northwest-wind, making the sea so blue, gives a very distinct outline 
in its junction with the sky.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><em>September</em> 16<em>th.</em>--On Tuesday, the 14th, there was no 
opportunity to get to the mainland. Yesterday morning opened with a southeast 
rain, which continued all day. The Fanny arrived in the forenoon, with some 
coal for Mr. Laighton, and sailed again before dinner, taking two of the maids 
of the house; but as it rained pouring, and as I could not, at any rate, have 
got home to-night, there would have been no sense in my going. It began to 
clear up in the decline of the day; the sun shot forth some golden arrows a 
little before his setting and the sky was perfectly clear when I went to bed, 
after spending the evening at Mr. Thaxter's. This morning is clear and bright; 
but the wind is northwest, making the sea look blue and cold, with little 
breaks of white foam. It is unfavorable for a trip to the mainland; but 
doubtless I shall find an opportunity of getting ashore before night.</p> 
<p>The highest part of Appledore is about eighty feet above the sea. Mr. 
Laighton has seen whales off the island,--both on the eastern side and between 
it and the mainland; once a great crowd of them, as many as fifty. They were 
drawn in by pursuing their food,--a small fish called herring-bait, which came 
ashore in such abundance that Mr. Laighton dipped up basketfuls of them. No 
attempt was made to take the whales.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>There are vague traditions of trees on these islands. One of them, Cedar 
Island, is said to have been named from the trees that grew on it. The matter 
appears improbable, though, Mr. Thaxter says, large quantities of soil are 
annually washed into the sea; so that the islands may have been better clad 
with earth and its productions than now.</p> 
<p>Mrs. Thaxter tells me that there are several burial-places on this island; 
but nobody has been buried here since the Revolution. Her own marriage was the 
first one since that epoch, and her little Karl, now three months old, the 
first-born child in all those eighty years.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>[<em>Then follow Extracts from the Church Records of Gosport.</em>]</p> 
<p>This book of the church records of Gosport is a small folio, well bound in 
dark calf, and about an inch thick; the paper very stout, with a water-mark of 
an armed man in a sitting posture, holding a spear . . . over a lion, who 
brandishes a sword; on alternate pages the Crown, and beneath it the letters G. 
R. The motto of the former device Pro Patria. The book is written in a very 
legible hand, probably by the Rev. Mr. Tucke. The ink is not much faded.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<h3>[1853]</h3> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><em>Concord, March</em> 9, 1853.--Finished, this day, the last story of 
&quot;Tanglewood Tales.&quot; They were written in the following order:--</p> 
<p>&quot;The Pomegranate Seeds.&quot;</p> 
<p>&quot;The Minotaur.&quot;</p> 
<p>&quot;The Golden Fleece.&quot;</p> 
<p>&quot;The Dragon's Teeth.&quot;</p> 
<p>&quot;Circe's Palace.&quot;</p> 
<p>&quot;The Pygmies.&quot;&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The Introduction is yet to be written. Wrote it 13th March. I went to 
Washington (my first visit) on 14th April.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Caresses, expressions of one sort or another, are necessary to the life of 
the affections, as leaves are to the life of a tree. If they are wholly 
restrained, love will die at the roots.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><em>June</em> 9<em>th.</em>--Cleaning the attic to-day, here at the 
Wayside, the woman found an immense snake, flat and outrageously fierce, 
thrusting out its tongue. Ellen, the cook, killed it. She called it an adder, 
but it appears to have been a striped snake. It seems a fiend, haunting the 
house. On further inquiry, the snake is described as plaided with brown and 
black.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Cupid in these latter times has probably laid aside his bow and arrows, and 
uses fire-arms,--a pistol,--perhaps a revolver.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>I burned great heaps of old letters, and other papers, a little while ago, 
preparatory to going to England. Among them were hundreds of letters. The world 
has no more such, and now they are all dust and ashes. What a trustful guardian 
of secret matters is fire! What should we do without fire and death?</p>
