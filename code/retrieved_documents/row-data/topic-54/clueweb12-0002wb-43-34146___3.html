<p>College students and sleep don't often go together. In fact, when things 
get stressful, sleep is often the first thing to get trimmed from the to-do 
list of many college students. So when you finally<i>do</i> find the time to 
sleep, how can you make sure you can sleep well?</p> <b>
<h3>10 Tips to Help College Students Sleep</h3></b> 
<ol> 
<li><b>Use earplugs.</b> They're cheap, they're easy to find at any drugstore 
(or even the campus bookstore), and they can block out the noise from your 
residence hall -- and your noisy, snoring roommate.</li> <br>

<li><b>Make things dark.</b> True, your roommate may need to be up all night 
writing the paper, but ask him or her to use a desk lamp instead of the main 
light for the room. Or, if you're crashing in the afternoon, close the blinds 
to help darken the room.</li> <br>

<li><b>Listen to relaxing music -- softly.</b> Sometimes, turning out the 
outside world can be challenging. Try listening to some relaxing music to help 
you focus on calming down instead of everything going on around you.</li> <br>

<li><b>Appreciate the sound of silence.</b> While music can help, silence can 
sometimes be even better. Turn off your phone, turn off the music, turn off the 
DVD you wanted to watch as you fall asleep.</li> <br>

<li><b>Exercise.</b> Being physically healthy can help you sleep better, too. 
Try to get some exercise during the day -- not too close to when you want to 
sleep, of course, but even a brisk walk to your morning classes for 30 minutes 
in the morning will help you later that night.</li> <br>

<li><b>Avoid caffeine in the afternoon.</b> That cup of coffee you had at 4:00 
p.m. could very well be keeping you up 8 hours later. Try water, juice, or any 
other caffeine-free option instead.</li> <br>

<li><b>Avoid energy drinks.</b> Sure, you needed that energy boost to make it 
through your evening class. But getting some exercise or eating a piece of 
fruit would have worked better than that energy drink -- and not kept you from 
sleeping later.</li> <br>

<li><b>Eat healthy.</b> If your body is in a funk, it can be hard to sleep at 
night. Remember what your mama taught you and focus more on fruits, vegetables, 
water, and whole grains than coffee, energy drinks, fried food, and pizza.</li> 
<br> 
<li><b>Lower your stress.</b> It may seem like Mission:Impossible, but 
reducing your stress can help you sleep. If you can't lower your overall stress 
level, try finishing a project or task -- no matter how small -- before you 
crawl into bed. You can feel accomplished instead of stressed about all you 
have to do.</li> <br>

<li><b>Relax for a few minutes before going to bed.</b> Reading your cell 
phone, checking email, texting friends, and doing all kinds of brain-busy tasks 
can interfere with your ability to truly relax and rewind. Try reading a 
magazine for a few minutes, meditating, or just resting quietly with no 
electronics -- you might be surprised at how quickly you end up catching some 
zzzzz's.</li> </ol> <br>
