<h1>CURRANTS</h1> 
<h2><i>Ribes</i> spp.</h2> 
<h2><i>Saxifragaceae</i></h2> <b>Common Names:</b> Currant (English), 
Johannisbeere (German), Ribes (Danish, Swedish, Italian), Groseille (French), 
Bes (Flemish).
<p> The English word 'currant' has been used for this fruit only since 1550, 
taken from the fruit's resemblance to the dried currants of Greece, raisins 
made from a small seedless grape. The much older English name 'ribes' is of 
ancient Indo-European origin and is common to other languages.</p> 
<p> <b>Species:</b> Red, pink and white currants belong to three European 
species (<i>Ribes rubrum</i>, <i>R. petraeum</i>, <i>R. sativum</i>). Black 
currants are related to European (<i>R. nigrum</i>) and Asian (<i>R. ussuriense
</i>) species. </p> 
<p> <b>Related Species:</b> Gooseberry (<i>Ribes grossularia</i>, <i>R. 
hirtellum</i>), Buffalo Currant (<i>R. aureum</i>), Jostaberry (<i>R. nigrum</i>
 X<i>hirtellum</i>). </p> 
<p> <b>Adaptation:</b> Currants grow best in summer humid, cool regions with 
great winter chilling. They are best adapted to USDA Hardiness Zones 3 through 
5, although in California they are fairly productive in the coolest parts of 
the San Francisco Bay Area and coastal northern California. They should be 
considered experimental only in southern California. Currants are amendable to 
container culture.</p> 
<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2> <b>Growth Habit:</b> All forms of currant are deciduous 
shrubs, fast growing under optimum conditions. The plant is a multiple-stemmed 
clump, to 5&nbsp;feet high and as broad, but is suitable for training as a 
standard. Annual growth is in a single flush in spring. The roots are 
superficial, fine and easily damaged by frequent cultivation.
<p> <b>Foliage:</b> The leaves are alternate, single, lobed and maple-like. 
Black currant leaves are pale green, while those of the red currant are deep 
blue-green. Both are easily burned by intense sunlight. Leaf size and number is 
reduced under water stress.</p> 
<p> <b>Flowers:</b> Currant flowers are borne toward the bases of one-year old 
stems and on spurs on older stems. They appear in early spring with new growth. 
Each flower bud opens to number of flowers (up to 20), joined together on a 
delicate, drooping 5 - 6&nbsp;inch stem, called a strig. The strig length is 
reduced or flowering is suppressed by lack of winter chill. Individual flowers 
(green in the case of red currants and blush pink for black currants) are not 
showy, but joined together on the strig they give the bush a lacy texture. 
Pollination is by hoverflies and other insects. Black currant flowers also 
attract honeybees. Most currants have self-fertile flowers, but a few cultivars 
are partially self-sterile, so set more fruits with cross-pollination. To 
increase both fruit size and number, clip off part of the ends of the strigs 
while the bushes are flowering. Depending upon the cultivar, fruits ripen from 
70 to 100&nbsp;days after blossoming.</p> 
<p> <b>Fruit:</b> Fully set strigs will be a pendulous chain of small berries. 
The fruit is easier to pick if their strigs are long and have 
&quot;handles&quot; (clear lengths at the bases) for holding onto while 
harvesting. Black currants commonly ripen from the top down, encouraging birds 
to strip berries as they color. Modern red currant varieties have been selected 
for their ability to ripen all the berries on a strig at once. Berries of red, 
white and pink currants are translucent; black currants are matte brown-purple. 
The berries contain 3 - 12&nbsp;minute, bony seeds.</p> 
<h2>CULTURE</h2> <b>Location:</b> Currants like morning sun, afternoon 
part-shade and buoyant air circulation. They can be grown in the high shade of 
fruit trees such as persimmon, as well as on the north side of buildings. The 
leaves sunburn readily and the plants collapse quickly when the soil or air 
temperature exceeds 85&deg;&nbsp;F. Currants can withstand ocean winds but the 
salt air will burn the leaves and turn them ragged.
<p> <b>Soil:</b> Currants are not finicky about soil but, in keeping with 
their proclivity for cold, prefer heavier soils richer in clay. A thick mulch 
of some organic material also keeps the soil cool in summer while adding humus 
to the soil. Sandy soils are less suitable for currants because they dry out 
too fast. The plants will not tolerate alkaline or salty soil.</p> 
<p> <b>Irrigation:</b> With their fibrous, shallow roots, currants are are 
ideal for drip irrigation. Keep the plants watered until the fruit is 
harvested. At this point they stop active growth and the watering frequency can 
be reduced. Plants stressed for water are susceptible to mildew.</p> 
<p> <b>Fertilization:</b> Apply nitrogen at an annual rate of about four 
ounces per square yard. With too much nitrogen the plants become more prone to 
disease. Potassium deficiency, evidenced by marginal scorching of the leaves is 
averted with about half an once of potassium to the square yard. Avoid 
potassium chloride, because currants are sensitive to the chloride ion.</p> 
<p> <b>Pruning:</b> Annual pruning increases yields and keeps plants 
manageable. Prune so that most fruits are borne on spurs of two- or three-year 
old wood. A program of pruning will maintain a continuous supply of such wood. 
In the winter of the plant's first season, remove at ground level all but two 
or three stems. The following winter again remove all but two or three that 
grew the previous season, at which point the bush will have two or three each 
of one- and two-year old stems. Continue this each season, but by the fourth 
winter start cutting away at their bases any stems more than three years old. 
Each winter also shorten long stems that have grown too scraggly. Do not prune 
after spring growth has commenced. Plants can be trained to a number of 
utilitarian and decorative forms.</p> 
<p> <b>Propagation:</b> Currant seeds germinate if stratified for three to 
four months at temperatures just above freezing. Seedlings are prolific and do 
not vary much from parent. Bushes grown from seed bear when two or three years 
old.</p> 
<p> Currants are easily propagated by hardwood cuttings of one-year old wood. 
Take one-foot cuttings of dormant wood in late winter, dip the base in rooting 
hormone and pot in ordinary soil. Cuttings will quickly root and are best kept 
in part shade for the first year. If the plants are to be grown as standards, 
strip all buds off cutting below soil line. Currants can also be grafted, but 
no advantage is gained.</p> 
<p> <b>Pests and Diseases:</b> Currants are subject to a variety of insect and 
disease pests. Gall mite (not reported yet in California) infests dormant buds 
during summer. Affected buds swell, form dried rosettes, and fail to break 
during following spring. Whole stem becomes blind and dies back to ground. 
Plant should be removed and burned immediately upon detection. Aphids commonly 
distort currant foliage causing red spots. Spider mites are common and also 
cause foliar distortion. Clear-winged borers lay their eggs on stems in late 
spring. The larvae hatch and bore into the stems where they remain until the 
following season. An infestation is usually detected only after the stem wilts 
and dies. Borers will spread and generally cause loss of a whole planting 
without quick control. Cut out affected stems, search for others and spray. The 
leaves are not attractive to deer.</p> 
<p> The most feared disease in black (rarely red) currant is reversion virus, 
and appears as weakened, barren plants with pleated leaves. The virus, which is 
spread by common and gall mites, is endemic in Europe but not yet known in 
California. There is no cure; do not import plant material from European 
sources.<i>Ribes</i> species are also host for white pine blister rust, which 
causes few problems for currants but is lethal for 5-needle pines, including 
California natives such as Western White (<i>Pinus monticola</i>) and Sugar 
Pine (<i>P. lambertiana</i>). Currants are banned in counties where these pines 
are grown for lumber.</p> 
<p> <i>Botrytis</i> and <i>Anthracnose</i> can cause rot of leaves and loss of 
young growth, usually stems lying on the ground or splashed during irrigation. 
Gooseberry mildew infects currants, especially in humid areas, but is not 
common in California. It is worst in coastal fog or where irrigation is by 
overhead sprinkling. Keep plants turgid, never water-stressed. Benomyl spray 
before flowering and after harvest should control it. Currant roots are 
susceptible to both Oak Root fungus (<i>Armillaria</i>) and <i>Phytophthora</i>.
</p> 
<p> <b>Harvest:</b> Most cultivars hold well on the plant. For fresh eating 
let the berries hang for about three weeks after they color up. If the fruits 
are to be stored at all, they should be picked dry. To avoid damaging the 
fruits, pick a whole strig by its stem, taking care not to damage the spur. 
Yields vary greatly, depending on growing conditions and cultivar. Anywhere 
from three pounds to over ten pounds may be harvested from a single bush.</p> 
<p> Currants are unsurpassed for jelly, but are also good in pies and sauces, 
especially when mixed with fruits that have body but lack sprightliness. 
Currants have also been used for wine, said by some to be similar in flavor to 
Graves or Rhine wines. Black currants are the traditional source of the French 
liqueur, Cassis.</p> 
<h2>CULTIVARS</h2> 
<h3>Red Currants</h3> 
<p> Red currants are for culinary use: juice, jellies and purees. Cultivars 
are selected for the clarity of juice, size of berry and productivity.</p> 
<dl> 
<dt> <b>Jonkheer van Tets</b> </dt> 
<dd> Origin J. Maarse, Schellenkhout (NL), 1931. Seedling of Fay's Prolific. 
Vigorous, habit spreading, bush open. Blooms early, resists mildew. Fruits 
earliest to ripen, tend to run off (drop) from strig.</dd> 
<dt> <b>Perfection</b> </dt> 
<dd> Origin Charles Hooker, Rochester NY, 1887. Bush upright, twiggy, roots 
particularly susceptible to Armillaria. Strigs clustered at base of current 
year's growth, fruits small to average, clear red, midseason.</dd> 
<dt> <b>Red Lake</b> </dt> 
<dd> Origin W.H. Alderman, Excelsior MN, 1933. Bush vigorous, much branching, 
roots most resistant to Armillaria, tolerates some dryness. Resists mildew. 
Tends to break dormancy early, with protracted bloom, some strigs ripening as 
others are still in bloom. Earlier fruits will mature while soil remains moist 
from winter rains. Berries dark red, rather small.</dd> 
<dt> <b>Wilder</b> - <i>R. Vulgare.</i> </dt> 
<dd> Origin E.G. Teas, Irvington IN, 1878. Seedling of Red Versailles. Bush 
spreading, tends to layer self. Largest of red currants. Ripens late, hold long 
on bush. Very productive of full strigs of rather oblate, pale red berries.</dd>
</dl> 
<h3>White Currants</h3> 
<p> An albino forms of the red currant. More versatile but less colorful than 
the red; fine for all culinary uses, but are of lower acidity, thus also 
suitable for fresh eating. The best sorts are nearly transparent.</p> 
<dl> 
<dt> <b>Weisse aus Juterbog</b> - <i>R. petraeum.</i> </dt> 
<dd> Origin Juterbog (D), 1890s. Bush slow growing, upright, sunburns easily. 
Not productive, few berries on short strigs, not adapted to California.</dd> 
<dt> <b>White Imperial</b> - <i>R. rubrum.</i> </dt> 
<dd> Origin S.D. Willard, Geneva, NY, 1890. Bush spreading, not upright, 
withstands California conditions well. Very productive on long strigs of small 
round berries. Lowest in acid of currants, suitable for dessert.</dd> 
<dt> <b>White Versailles</b> - <i>R. vulgare.</i> </dt> 
<dd> Origin Bertin, Versailles (F), 1840. Bush tall, branches few. Not 
vigorous. Fairly productive of well-filled strigs. Berries round, seedy. 
Midseason.</dd> </dl> 
<h3>Pink Currants</h3> 
<p> Pink Currants are intermediate between red and white types, in degree of 
pigmentation. Skin is colorless, flesh is pink. All are<i>R. vulgare</i>. </p> 
<dl> 
<dt> <b>Gloire des Sablons</b> </dt> 
<dd> Origin France, ancient. Most common form of pink currant. Bush upright, 
not branching, productive, berries quite large but few on strig.</dd> </dl> 
<h3>Black Currants</h3> 
<p> Black Currants have a characteristic aroma, highly esteemed by natives of 
northern Europe. Leaves also release the scent when rubbed. Fruit are 
astringent, suitable only for culinary uses. Certain Canadian cultivars 
(Consort, Crusader, Coronet) are<i>R. nigrum</i> X <i>ussuriense</i> hybrids, 
bred to resist mildew and rust, are self- and inter-sterile and of inferior 
flavor, are not recommended.</p> 
<dl> 
<dt> <b>Blacksmith</b> </dt> 
<dd> Origin Laxton Bros, Bedford (GB), 1916. Bush very vigorous, quick to 
reach bearing size, much branching. Productive, strigs long, flavor fair.</dd> 
<dt> <b>Boskoop Giant</b> </dt> 
<dd> Origin Boskoop (NL), 1890s. Bush vigorous, upright, branching low. 
Requires pollinator. Strigs few and short, berries not uniform in size. Flavor 
good.</dd> 
<dt> <b>Noir de Bourgogne</b> </dt> 
<dd> Origin Dijon (F), very ancient. The traditional black currant for making 
Cassis. Bush very spreading, low open. Fairly productive, slow to begin 
producing. Strigs short, many, berries of best flavor.</dd> 
<dt> <b>Wellington XXX</b> </dt> 
<dd> Origin R. Wellington, East Malling (GB), 1913. Bush spreading, often 
trailing and self-layering. Withstands adverse conditions (sun). Berries tend 
to &quot;run off&quot;, shed before strig fully mature. Flavor fair.</dd> 
<dt> <b>Willoughby</b> </dt> 
<dd> Origin Walter Willoughby, Parkside, Sask., 1940. Bush open, spreading, 
hardy to cold and sun, resists mildew. Fertile, short strigs, fair flavor.</dd> 
</dl> 
<h3>Buffalo Currants</h3> 
<p> <i>Ribes aureum.</i> A distant relative of the common Ribes, Buffalo 
Currant is probably closer to gooseberry. Native to American prairies, they are 
extraordinarily hardy bushes and productive. The bush resembles common Ribes, 
but is wider and weeping, with branch tips eventually touching the ground. It 
needs no pruning and stems tend to go blind, shedding dormant buds after the 
first year. It tolerates a wide range of soils, even alkali, and does not 
require much winter chill. Leaves are small, felty, gray-green and many-lobed. 
Flowers are profuse, showy, yellow and fragrant, resemble Forsythia in bloom. 
It makes a prolific production of pea-sized or larger, glossy brownish-purple, 
bland-flavored berries with persistent style, that resemble American gooseberry 
when cooked. They are palatable raw or cooked. Ripe fruits last long on the 
bush, often 2&nbsp;months. It is adaptable to a range of climates and the only 
species recommended for southern California.</p> 
<dl> 
<dt> <b>Crandall</b> </dt> 
<dd> Origin uncertain, probably Iowa, 1890s. Still the best for fruit quality. 
Bush rather weak, weeping, fruit hidden inside foliage, difficult to find.</dd> 
</dl> 
<h3>Jostaberry</h3> 
<p> Jostaberries are hybrids of black currant and the American gooseberry, <i>
R. hirtellum</i>, produced in Germany, 1930s-50s. They are currently a subject 
of commercial promotion, but performance in California is disappointing. The 
bush is very tall, thornless, tends not to branch and requires the space of 2 
currant bushes. The foliage is glossy, larger than gooseberry, lobed, scentless 
and resists mildew. It survives full sunlight but requires much winter 
chilling. The lateral buds usually shed, leaving blind branches. Purple or 
brownish-red fruit are borne on lax, few-berried strigs. They are the size of 
small gooseberry and lacking in flavor, suitable only for experimentation. 
Buffalo currant produces comparable fruit more abundantly in less space and is 
recommended instead. New forms of Josta, backcrossed to the black currant 
parent, may be better than original types.</p>
