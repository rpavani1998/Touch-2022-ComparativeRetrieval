<h2>Transcript:Natural Remedies for Better Sleep</h2>Hi, I'm Cathy Wong, your 
guide to Alternative Medicine on About.com.<br>

<h3>Natural Sleep Remedies</h3>Getting a good night's sleep is just as 
important to our health as diet &amp; exercise. Poor sleep can drain our 
energy, dampen our mood, and add to our stress. Over time, it can also increase 
the risk of obesity, diabetes, and heart disease. So if you're not sleeping as 
well as you could be, let's look at some natural remedies that may help.<br>

<h3> Lavender as Sleep a Remedy</h3>The soothing aroma of English lavender 
flowers has long been used as a folk remedy to help people fall asleep.<br>

Research is beginning to confirm lavender's sedative properties. It's been 
found to lengthen total sleep time and improve sleep quality. Lavender appears 
to work better for women, possibly because women tend to have a more acute 
sense of smell.<br>
<br>
The good thing about lavender is that it begins to 
work quickly. Try adding 6 drops of lavender oil to a bath--the drop in body 
temp that occurs after a warm bath also helps with sleep. Or, put a couple of 
drops of lavender oil on a handkerchief and tuck it under your pillow.<br>
<br>

And speaking of pillows, if hot flashes are keeping you up, many people find 
this cooling foam pillow insert, called a Chillow, helps to absorb excess body 
heat throughout the night.<br>

<h3> Light Therapy as a Natural Sleep Remedy</h3>If you have trouble falling 
asleep, you may need more light early in the morn. Light exposure plays a key 
role in telling the body when to go to sleep and when to wake up. So try taking 
a walk first thing in the morning. On the other hand, if you find you're waking 
up too early in the morning, you may need more afternoon light. Try taking a 
walk in the late afternoon. Just be sure to use sunscreen to protect your skin 
from getting damaged by the sun's ultraviolet rays.<br>

<h3>Progressive Muscle Relaxation as a Sleep Remedy</h3>Progressive muscle 
relaxation is one of the most promising natural sleep remedies. Studies suggest 
it may shorten the time to fall asleep &amp; help you get back to sleep if 
you've woken up during the night.<br>
<br>
Best part is, it's easy to learn. 
Here's how to do it: Lie down. Start at your feet. Inhale deeply &amp; sense 
the weight of your toes. Focus on any tension in them. Now exhale &amp; let all 
the tension quickly leave your toes. Allow that relaxed feeling to push out any 
tension that's left. Move on to your feet, calves, knees, thighs, abdomen, 
buttocks, chest, hands, upper arms, shoulders, neck, head, mouth, jaw, eyes, 
face &amp; cheeks. Some people find it helpful to physically clench each set of 
muscles for 4 to 10 seconds as they inhale and then allow those muscles to go 
limp as they exhale.<br>

<h3>Music as a Sleep Remedy</h3>Soft, slow music is another remedy that can 
help to improve sleep without med. It's been found to improve sleep quality, 
decrease nightly awakenings, lengthen sleep time and increase satisfaction with 
sleep.<br>

<h3>Valerian as a Natural Sleep Remedy</h3>Valerian is a herb that has been 
used as a natural sleep aid in Europe for decades. Unlike many other sleep 
meds, valerian is not believed to be addictive or to cause grogginess in the 
morn. But it doesn't work for everyone. And although studies in labs have been 
encouraging, clinical trials are inconclusive. Valerian takes about 2 to 3 
weeks to work. It shouldn't be used for more than 3 months at a time. It's 
typically taken 1 hour before bed. Although rare, valerian may cause headache, 
palpitations, and dizziness. It shouldn't be taken with alcohol, many 
medications such as sedatives, before or after surgery or by people with liver 
disease.<br>

<h3>Before You Use a Sleep Remedy</h3>If you're having trouble falling asleep, 
the first step is to consult your Doctor. Talk with him/her about any remedies 
before you try it.<br>
<br>
Chronic insomnia can also be a symptoms of another 
condition, such as depression, heart disease, sleep apnea, lung disease, hot 
flashes, or diabetes, another reason why it's important to be assessed.<br>
