<h3>Plant Fruit Trees Now!</h3> 
<p>&nbsp;<br>
Here at North Haven, we knoow you love to <strong>eat fresh 
edibles</strong> grown in your own backyard. With harvest time just around the 
corner, many are dreaming of fresh fruit and homemade pies. Why not plant your 
very own urban orchard this weekend? Not only will you be devouring the 
mouth-watering fruits of your labor for years to come, you will also have 
delightful blooming trees to decorate your yard early next spring.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Fruit trees require 6 or more hours of sun a day, but may not require as 
much space as you think. There are dwarf varieties of many favorites available, 
such as peaches &lsquo;Bonanza&rsquo; and &lsquo;Bonfire&rsquo;. Other 
space-saving options include container growing, growing on an espalier, and 
columnar apples that grow full size fruits on very narrow trees. It&rsquo;s 
worth noting that most fruit trees can easily be kept pruned to the 
gardener&rsquo;s desired height. Some folks may also be concerned with how many 
trees they can fit in their yard and still get fruit. Its true that most trees 
require a cross pollinator, and those that don&rsquo;t will still produce more 
heavily with one. However, there are some exceptions such as peaches, 
pomegranates, and plums. If your neighborhood has a lot of fruit trees, they 
may cross-pollinate each other, allowing you to cheat a bit.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;<br>
Once you&rsquo;ve selected your site, plant into native soil, or 
use<strong>North Haven Organic Potting Soil in containers</strong>. <strong>
Mulch</strong>well wherever you plant. All fruit trees will benefit from a 
feeding of<strong>Espoma Tree-tone</strong>, and how often will depend on the 
variety of tree. During late December, you should spray with<strong>organic 
Dormant Oil</strong>to help head off any pest problems that might otherwise 
develop later in the season.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;</p> 
<p>After choosing from all the exciting fruit tree varieties&nbsp;at North 
Haven&nbsp;Gardens that&nbsp;perform well in our area, you can have your 
backyard orchard planted in no time.</p>

<h3>Plant NOW: Golden Fall Color! Sumac 'Tiger's Eye' </h3> 
<p>&nbsp;<br>
<em>Photo Credit:&nbsp;Growing is Beautiful</em></p> 
<p>The glorious, gold fall foliage of <strong>Sumac</strong> &lsquo;<strong>
Tiger&rsquo;s Eye&rsquo;</strong>is a true eye-catcher and crowd-pleaser. It 
positively glows in the landscape through fall. But don&rsquo;t let the 
graceful, delicate appearance of this cultivar fool you;<em>Rhus typhina 
&lsquo;Bailtiger</em>&rsquo; is a stellar performer in a North Texas Garden, and
<strong>NOW is the time to plant them</strong>!</p> 
<p>These Sumacs belong to a small class of deciduous shrubs native to Eastern 
North America. Local artisans in these regions use the leaves and stems of many 
varieties to make dyes. They have a reputation for their ability to adapt to a 
wide range of soil types, although they perform best in<strong>well-drained 
beds amended with compost and expanded shale</strong>.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;<br>
<em>Photo Credit: Fine Gardening</em></p> 
<p>The <strong>Sumac</strong> &lsquo;<strong>Tiger&rsquo;s Eye&rsquo; </strong>
matures to a 6 foot tall and wide mound comprised of&nbsp; feathery, light 
leaves on furry, coral stems. That adds an extra contrast to the foliage in all 
its stages of color, whether the red-tinged appearance of new spring growth, 
the bright green of summer, or the eye-popping gold of fall. The bare winter 
branches are very sculptural and architectural.</p> 
<p>If you have longingly admired the autumn brilliance of Japanese Maples, but 
have too much sun for them to thrive in your garden, this Sumac could provide 
that late season color you desire. They will grow in full sun, but will also 
perform well with a few hours of afternoon shade. They can also be used as a 
container specimen to stunning effect. FollowNHG&rsquo;s First Year Care 
Guide&nbsp; to get them off to a successful start. At planting time, add a root 
stimulator such as<strong>Carl Pool Root Activator</strong>. Little maintenance 
is required after establishment other than an early summer and a&nbsp;fall 
application of a balanced, slow release fertilizer like<strong>Texas Tee
</strong>, and some shaping.</p>

<h3>Plant NOW! Sweet Olive</h3> 
<p>&nbsp;<br>
<em>Photo credit: Forest &amp; Kim Starr</em></p> 
<p><em>Osmanthus fragrans</em>, or Sweet Olive<em>,</em> is a heavily fragrant 
part-shade shrub. It&rsquo;s sweet, orange-scented blossoms permeate the cool 
fall and spring air. It&rsquo;s a scent you&rsquo;ll come to find very familiar 
and look forward to each season.&nbsp;You'll love these evergreen 
shrubs&nbsp;beautiful, glossy foliage that drips with clusters of small, creamy 
white blooms.</p> 
<p>Sweet Olives will mature to 8 to 10 feet high, and 6 feet wide, so be sure 
to provide plenty of space, or plan on pruning away lower limbs to create a 
tree form. The ideal planting area should receive 5 hours of morning sun and be 
shaded from direct afternoon summer sun. If you are planting in a prepared bed, 
amend with compost or composted cotton burrs, and expanded shale. If you are 
planting as a specimen or hedge, you can&nbsp;plant directly into the native 
soil. Apply root stimulator such as<strong>HiYield Root Stimulator</strong>
&nbsp;every 4 weeks during the first 12 months. Water regularly with deep 
infrequent waterings.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Beginning in the second year after planting, around the last week of 
August, give them a cleanup with your hand pruners. Remove any broken branches, 
lightly tip them to promote fullness, and shape as desired. Follow up with an 
application of a slow-release fertilizer just after Labor Day. Here at North 
Haven Gardens, we love<strong>Espoma Holly Tone</strong>.</p> 
<p>Plant these scented beauties this now and start to enjoy fragrance this 
fall!</p>

<h3>Stay Hydrated! Summer Watering Tips for Plants</h3> 
<p>&nbsp;<br>
This article was taken from our <strong>July-August 2007 
Newsletter</strong>. Our <strong>archived newsletters here</strong>&nbsp;are an 
excellent resource as we try to offer fresh, timely information each year.</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Add 2&quot;-3&quot; of <strong>mulch </strong>to all plantings, including 
veggies, shrubs, trees, etc. Mulch retains moisture in the soil, regulates soil 
temperature (cooler in summer, warmer in winter), decomposes into the soil over 
time to increase soil health, and gives your garden a finished look. We have a 
variety of mulches available.</li> 
<li>Water every corner of your garden! Make sure you have the proper hose 
lengths to reach every area of your garden. Add a water want to the hose to get 
the water where it's needed most, at the base of the plants.</li> 
<li>The best time to water is during the early morning hours. A 6am start is 
ideal. Drink coffee...water plants!</li> 
<li>Water well! 1&quot;-1.5&quot; of water per week minimum. With our extreme 
temperatures, you will need to offer supplemental water every few days, and in 
some case daily (tomatoes!), to new plantings. Get out there and test your 
soil. If it's dry past 2 knuckles, you must water asap.</li> 
<li>Don't forget containers and hanging baskets. They&nbsp;will dry out 
much&nbsp;faster. A simple drip-irrigation will help. We carry&nbsp;Plant 
Nannies that can help and&nbsp;the<strong> Gilmore Plant 
&amp;&nbsp;Deck&nbsp;sprinkler system</strong> as well.</li> 
<li>Use <strong>soaker hoses </strong>to provide a slow drip watering. These 
can be run any time of day.</li> 
<li><strong>Tree Gator Bags</strong>&nbsp; are a great drip irrigation bag 
that is perfect for newly planted trees.</li> 
<li>Planting new color containers? Add <strong>Soil Moist </strong>or <strong>
KoKo Chips</strong>to retain moisture. Top off the container design with 
2&quot;-3&quot; of mulch.</li> </ul> 
<p>Need more help? We are here 7 days a week to help keep your plants hydrated.

<h3>Heat Stressing You AND Your Plants? We Have a Solution!</h3> 
<p>Is your turf tired and yellowing? Is water just sitting on top of your 
soil? We have two organic options in-store that will reduce heat stress on your 
plants, therefore easing your stress, too!<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> 
<p><strong>&nbsp;<br>
Enviro Raindrops:</strong> We've all seen garden soil so 
dry that water literally rolls off the top without even wetting the surface. 
Or, container plants that have reached a state of dryness so severe that the 
media has shrunk away from the sides of the pot and water merely flows out the 
sides without actually watering the plant. When mixed with water, Enviro 
Raindrops&nbsp;overcomes the surface resistance of dry soil particles and 
allows water to seep in. Applied to a neglected landscape or to trouble spots 
in the yard, it reduces plant stress, enables and encourages root growth, 
allows for enhanced water uptake, and reduces runoff/waste.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>&nbsp;<br>
Agrispon: </strong>A biostimulant applied&nbsp;to soils 
that are low in microbial activity. Agrispon forms a symbiotic relationship 
between the plant and the soils. This relationship assists in nutrient uptake, 
plant health, and resistance to environmental stresses such as heat and drought 
stress. Additionally, a biologically active soil has better granular structure, 
and better water absorption. Agrispon is a concentrate and can be easily 
applied using a hose-end sprayer. When added to an existing maintained 
landscape on a regular schedule, it enhances necessary nutrients in the soil, 
allows for better water absorption, encourages root growth, and promotes 
overall plant health.</p>

<h3>Delicious, Homegrown Avocados for YOU!</h3> 
<p><strong>&nbsp;<br>
Avocado trees are in stock now!</strong> We&rsquo;re 
very happy to introduce<strong>&lsquo;Joey,&rsquo; &lsquo;Lila,&rsquo; and 
&lsquo;Poncho.&rsquo;</strong>All are variants of the Mexican Avocado, with 
fruits about 6 to 8 ounces in size. Mature trees are 15&rsquo; to 20&rsquo; 
tall and as wide, so allow plenty of space.<strong>Avocados perform best with a 
partner for cross-pollination, so allow room for two (or get a tree for your 
neighbor).</strong>Provide a western or south western exposure to provide 
radiant heat in the colder months. In winter, mulch trees above the graft union 
on the trunk; mulch should be cleared away once danger of freeze is past. Trees 
should be covered once temperatures reach the 20s. Since the trunks are 
susceptible to sun scald, you&rsquo;ll want to wrap the exposed portion of the 
trunks during summer months to avoid damage.</p> 
<p>Plant Avocados in a hole as deep as the root ball and double the width in 
native soil. No need to amend the soil. It&rsquo;s important to acclimate trees 
to our soils as quickly as possible. Remember when planting you&rsquo;ll want 
to deeply water the newly installed tree, and monitor its water needs 
throughout the first year. A<strong>tree gator </strong>is perfect to keep it 
consistently watered for it's first summer. Give it root stimulator such as
<strong>Superthrive </strong>at time of planting, and once each month for the 
first 12 months. After the first year, fertilize spring, summer, and fall with
<strong>Espoma Citrus-tone </strong>to keep them healthy.</p>

<h3>What's Pretty at NHG?</h3> 
<p>Well, I could say &quot;EVERYTHING!&quot;. But, I'll narrow it down for you.
</p> 
<p><strong>&nbsp;<br>
Japanese Maples.</strong> Every home lucky enough to 
have some shade should have at least one Japanese Maple. Feed with<strong>
Espoma Holly-tone</strong>and it'll offer gorgeous color spring, summer and 
fall. Right now, my personal favorites are<strong>'Coral Bark' </strong>and 
<strong>'Bloodgood'</strong> <em>(above).</em> The color on these is gorgeous!
</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>&nbsp;<br>
Roses.</strong> Right now, most of the roses are 
blooming. Get them in the ground this weekend and you'll still be able to enjoy 
the color. Especially if you plant any of the<strong>Knockout Series </strong>in
<strong>red</strong>, <strong>pink </strong>and <strong>yellow</strong>. These 
are some tough roses that need minimal maintenance. Our best recommendation for 
all roses is to amend the soil with at least 2 bags of<strong>Vital Earth Ready 
Rose</strong>Mix and feed with <strong>NHG Organic Rose Food</strong>. Prune 
around Valentine's Day (we always offer a class on pruning right before then).
</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>&nbsp;<br>
Purple Perennials. </strong>Purple is such a glorious 
color in any garden. It's a great contrast alongside oranges and yellows. Or, 
plant with pinks and whites for a softer palette. Right now, the<strong>Society 
Garlic</strong><em> (above) </em>is blooming gracefully. <strong>Perennial 
Verbena</strong>is glowing. And, the <strong>Scabiosa </strong>is exploding 
purple! I have planted and loved all three of these. They perform especially 
well in the drought tolerant garden.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>&nbsp;<br>
Achillea. </strong>This is one of my favorite plants! 
The first year I had it in the garden it was not the graceful plant I had 
imagined. But, the next year and each year since, it has gotten fuller and 
bloomed bigger.<strong>'Pomegranate'</strong> is absolutely gorgeous and in 
stock now. Lots of colors and varieties.</p> 
<p>We have a huge selection of perennials and annuals for sun and shade. Plus, 
shrubs, fruit trees, herbs, vegetables, trees, vines. Whatever space in the 
garden you want to enjoy more, we'll help you get there. Open 7 days a week for 
you! Including at 8am on Saturdays.</p> 
<p>Happy Gardening!<br>

<h3>Instant Serenity: Japanese Maples</h3> 
<p><strong>&nbsp;<em></em></strong></p> 
<p><strong>Japanese maples</strong> are magnificent small trees to help create 
your zen garden along with water features, Buddha statues and shaded sitting 
areas. Japanese maples are slow growing, have many different growth habits, a 
huge variety of leaf shapes, and spectacular fall color that ranges from golden 
yellow to fiery red. They perform best as a unique specimen plant in 
well-amended beds where they will receive no more than 4 hours of morning sun. 
Plant into existing beds or build new ones amended with<strong>expanded shale
</strong> and lots of <strong>acidified compost</strong>. Dig your hole twice 
as wide and just as deep as the root ball. Place into the hole and backfill 
with existing soil. Water thoroughly and apply a 2&rdquo;- 3&rdquo; layer of
<strong>mulch</strong>. Add <strong>root stimulator </strong>when you plant and 
monthly thereafter for the first year. Apply<strong>Cloud Cover </strong>in May 
to prevent leaf scorch due to our warm summer temperatures. Smaller varieties 
of Japanese maples also work well in containers.<em>We have a fresh, new 
selection of pottery in stock now.</em></p> 
<p>Take a look at our Japanese Maple List here. Visit the store to see what 
varieties are in stock now. More arriving through spring.</p>

<h3>Climbing Hydrangeas: Romantic, lush and pretty</h3> 
<p>&nbsp;<br>
<em><strong>In stock now! </strong></em>Hydrangeas are so lovely 
in the shaded garden. They provide showy, elegant flowers in late spring 
through midsummer above glossy green foliage. The seasons bring golden leaves 
in autumn, and reveal peeling shaggy bark when dormant in winter. 
Wouldn&rsquo;t this be fantastic as a vine for shaded areas? Climbing Hydrangea 
(<em>Hydrangea anomala petiolaris</em>) is a deciduous woody vine that performs 
well in dappled shade. Although it requires at least two years to establish, 
the rewards are worth it! It sports glossy, heart-shaped leaves and lacecap 
flowers that, in maturity, give a the vine tiered effect. It develops a 
substantial trunk and limbs with age, and climbs by aerial rootlets that attach 
to flat surfaces. It&rsquo;s perfect for covering walls, sturdy arbors or 
screens. Climbing Hydrangea prefers rich, well-drained acid soil conditions, so 
amend garden beds with plenty of expanded shale and Back to Earth Acidified 
compost.</p>

<h3>Go Fresh, not Fake this holiday season!</h3> 
<p>Nothing says &ldquo;holiday&rdquo; more than fragrant and fresh Christmas 
trees, wreaths and garland. Decorate your home with the real thing this year 
for a &ldquo;green&rdquo; holiday!<strong> Christmas trees are a renewable 
American resource.</strong> They also absorb carbon dioxide, create oxygen, are 
biodegradable, can be recycled as mulch and provide refuge for wildlife. The 
U.S. Christmas Tree industry creates as many as<strong>100,000 U.S. jobs
</strong> each year. To ensure a constant supply, tree farms plant up to 3 new 
seedlings for each tree harvested. Plus, fresh trees and greens will never sit 
in a landfill for centuries after disposal!</p> 
<p>Here at<strong> North Haven Gardens</strong> we have the best Christmas 
trees in town. Each one is given a fresh cut at delivery, then sprayed with an 
all-natural anti-transpirant to help the tree hold moisture. Each tree is 
lovingly hung from our roof and set in it's own bucket of fresh water. You can 
spin the trees around completely so you know exactly what they will look like 
in your home. To top it off, each tree has it's own name tag, so you can adopt 
one with a name you love! When you purchase your tree from us, we'll give the 
trunk another fresh cut and net it for you for safe travels. We also deliver 
and set up trees in select areas of Dallas.</p> 
<p>This year, we will have American grown Noble Fir, Douglas Fir and new this 
year the Nordmann Fir. Nordmann Firs are the preferred Christmas tree of Europe 
and feature long, full, lush, dark green foliage that is soft to the 
touch.&nbsp; They have supurb needle retention.&nbsp; This species is little 
known to us Americans, but is rumored to be the best Christmas tree around.</p>
