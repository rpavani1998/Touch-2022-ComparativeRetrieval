<p><b>Lower heating costs this winter?</b></p> 
<p><b>By Chuck McGuire</b></p> 
<p><b>Staff Writer</b></p> 
<p>Energy providers are projecting lower natural gas prices and reduced 
consumer heating bills this winter.</p> 
<p>Last month, Xcel Energy predicted that Colorado customers would see a 
decrease of 14 percent in typical residential natural gas bills in December, 
compared to the same month in 2005. Bills for typical small-business customers 
are expected to decline by 13 percent. The company further suggested that this 
month's natural gas prices would be 36 percent lower than last month, and 48 to 
50 percent less than October of last year.</p> 
<p>Though not required to file projections for winter-month bills, an Xcel 
spokesperson said the company did so because of strong customer interest in 
home heating costs. A home heating season runs from October through March, and 
projections are based on gas use in December, which is among the months seeing 
the highest consumption in a heating season.</p> 
<p>Of course, projections are subject to future market conditions, pricing and 
weather patterns, and actual prices are established upon Colorado Public 
Utilities Commission acceptance of the company's annual Gas Cost Adjustment 
filing.</p> 
<p>In projecting this year's rate decrease, Xcel said it expects more stable 
prices this winter, and does not anticipate overall increases of 25 to 35 
percent, as seen in each of the previous three years.</p> 
<p>In September, Ethnie Groves, of Xcel Energy Media Relations, said the 
company's projections reflect a likely drop in the market price of natural gas, 
along with a long-range forecast calling for a return to &quot;normal&quot; 
winter weather patterns. The 2005/2006 heating season was warmer than average.
</p> 
<p>Other factors influencing the projected price of natural gas include the 
normal decline in summer cooling loads, a lack of threatening hurricanes in the 
Gulf of Mexico, and an increase in underground storage.</p> 
<p>The Energy Information Administration reported 2.976 trillion cubic feet of 
natural gas in storage at the end of the first week in September. That was 312 
billion cubic feet more than last year's totals for the same time frame, and 
322 billion cubic feet higher than the five-year average.</p> 
<p>According to Xcel projections, typical residential customers will pay an 
average of $135.18 to heat their homes with natural gas in December. That 
compares to $157.12 in December, 2005, based on a use of 143.8 therms. 
Small-business customers will pay $622.14, compared to $713.11 last year, with 
an average use of 679.4 therms.</p> 
<p>Though Xcel Energy provides natural gas to areas in northern and central 
Colorado, Kinder Morgan, Inc. is the primary provider of the commodity to 
Archuleta County. Kinder Morgan Senior Business Relations Representative 
Natalie Shelbourn told The SUN that her company also anticipates a notable 
decrease in natural gas rates this winter, but was unable to specify how much. 
</p> 
<p>&quot;We haven't filed our annual Gas Cost Adjustment yet,&quot; Shelbourn 
said, &quot;but when we do, we'll be able to project specific numbers 
then.&quot; Kinder Morgan plans to file its GCA today.</p> 
<p>While this is good news for users of natural gas, the outlook for those 
heating their homes with propane isn't as rosy.</p> 
<p>According to the owners of two local propane distributors, propane is a 
byproduct of natural gas and must be refined. Its price fluctuations typically 
follow that of natural gas, but changes are often delayed as much as a year. 
With that in mind, propane consumers will not likely see much, if any, real 
relief in home heating bills this winter. However, as of Tuesday, a gallon of 
propane cost $1.60, compared to $1.85 last winter.</p>

<p><b>Health service district seeks extended TABOR exemption</b></p> 
<p><b>By Chuck McGuire</b></p> 
<p><b>Staff Writer</b></p> 
<p>The Upper San Juan Health Service District is asking voters to approve 
Ballot Issue 4A in the Nov. 7 general election.</p> 
<p>According to proponents, approval of 4A would, for another 10 years, 
continue the district's current exemption from limitations ordinarily imposed 
on it by TABOR. Voters approved the current exemption in 2002, but it expires 
at the end of this year.</p> 
<p>TABOR, or the 1992 Taxpayer's Bill of Rights (Article X, Section 20 of the 
Colorado Constitution), forces revenue collection, retention and spending 
limitations on state and local governments, including counties, municipalities, 
special districts and school districts.</p> 
<p>Further, Section 29-1-301 of the Colorado Revised Statutes caps allowable 
annual growth at 5.5 percent. </p> 
<p>Under TABOR, the amount USJHSD can raise, keep and spend each year is 
limited to an amount equal to inflation in the prior year, plus annual local 
growth (percentage of population). If 4A is approved, supporters say the 
district will be able to provide adequate health care to the entire community 
at a rate more in line with increasing costs and demand, rather than being tied 
to inflation and compulsory caps.</p> 
<p>Though no one filed written comments in opposition to 4A by the 
constitutional deadline, proponents also point out that, upon passage, it would 
not increase the current property tax mill levy without subsequent voter 
approval.</p> 
<p>As written, the ballot issue reads: &quot;Shall Upper San Juan Health 
Service District be authorized to collect, retain and spend all revenues it 
receives from all sources, including without limitation the district's existing 
property tax, which property tax mill levy will not be increased without voter 
approval, commencing January 1, 2007 through December 31, 2016, as a voter 
approved revenue change pursuant to Article X, Section 20 of the Colorado 
Constitution and regardless of the provisions of any other law, including 
without limitation the 5.5 percent tax revenue limit of 29-1-301, C.R.S.?&quot;
</p> 
<p>A &quot;yes&quot; vote is a vote in favor of changing current law or 
existing circumstances, and a &quot;no&quot; vote is a vote against changing 
current law or existing circumstances.</p>

<p><b>Demolition moratorium passes on first reading</b></p> 
<p><b>James Robinson</b></p> 
<p><b>Staff Writer</b></p> 
<p>A re-worked moratorium prohibiting demolitions of buildings 50 years old 
and older passed muster on first reading during a special meeting Wednesday of 
the Pagosa Springs Town Council.</p> 
<p>As approved the re-tuned moratorium, Ordinance Number 683, will replace the 
town's previous demolition ordinance, Number 666, and expands provisions for 
exemptions with changes in two key areas.</p> 
<p>First, the new ordinance allows property owners to seek exemptions from the 
demolition moratorium if they can prove their building is structurally unsound. 
Second, the ordinance allows the town council to grant an exemption if the 
property owner can demonstrate that maintaining or keeping the building 
&quot;as is&quot; is an economic hardship.</p> 
<p>As written, the ordinance does not define &quot;structurally unsound&quot; 
or &quot;economic hardship,&quot; and lacks parameters, procedures or 
documentation required in order for a petitioner to support their case.</p> 
<p>Ordinance 666 allowed exemptions primarily when the town's historic 
preservation board found a structure void of historic significance.</p> 
<p>In both ordinances, the historic preservation board is an advisory board 
and the town council the final arbiter in all exemption requests.</p> 
<p>Council member Tony Simmons said he was concerned because the re-worked 
ordinance lacked a definition or parameters for establishing &quot;economic 
hardship.&quot;</p> 
<p>&quot;It's not in the code. We do not have an established criteria for 
that. It hasn't been included in here,&quot; said Tamra Allen, town planner. 
&quot;It's something we could take a look at including if we needed to.&quot;
</p> 
<p>Simmons said the council was treading dangerous water without such language 
or criteria incorporated into the ordinance.</p> 
<p>&quot;We already have historic criteria that has been criticized for being 
vague. I would strongly urge my fellow council members to consider establishing 
a criteria,&quot; Simmons said.</p> 
<p>Council member John Middendorf asked the council why they were repealing 
the previous demolition moratorium at the behest of a single property owner.</p>
<p>He said the town's willingness to modify or repeal legislation when it 
became inconvenient for a single individual sent the wrong message.</p> 
<p>&quot;My concern is with the process,&quot; Middendorf said. &quot;We 
passed the law (Ordinance 666) six months ago, one person doesn't like the law, 
so we replace it. We're basically saying there's no backbone to anything we 
pass. We need to stick to our guns and plan for the future. We need to make 
decisions that are good for the whole, not just one developer.&quot;</p> 
<p>Council member Darrel Cotton said the council wasn't simply bending to 
Pinewood Inn owner Charles Craig's or developer Harold Kelley's request for an 
exemption.</p> 
<p>Kelley had agreed to purchase the Pinewood Inn contingent upon the town 
issuing him an extended, non-revocable demolition permit, despite the fact that 
the preservation board recommended that two structures on the property be bound 
by the previous moratorium. After nearly 10 hours of negotiations with the 
town, Kelley walked away from the deal, and Craig was left with a property he 
believes is saleable only with a demolition permit.</p> 
<p>After Kelley walked away from the deal during the last town council 
session, Craig's lawyer William Darling asked the council to re-write the 
moratorium with provisions for exemptions based on economic hardship or a 
building's lack of structural integrity. The council agree to Darling's request.
</p> 
<p>Cotton said the push for the re-worked moratorium was an effort to rectify 
sloppy, knee-jerk legislation passed after a string of demolitions occurred 
along the east end of Pagosa Street. He added that contingencies for economic 
hardship and structural integrity give property owners options they are 
entitled to under the town's current historic preservation regulations. </p> 
<p>In response to Middendorf's query of why the town council was unwilling to 
uphold the former moratorium until the council and preservation board could 
overhaul the town's historic preservation regulations, Cotton said, &quot;We 
stopped the sale of a piece of property with the legislation and we shouldn't 
do that.&quot;</p> 
<p>Council member Judy James motioned for approval of the new ordinance on 
first reading, contingent upon inclusion of criteria for establishing economic 
hardship.</p> 
<p>James, Cotton and Mayor Ross Aragon voted in favor. Middendorf and Simmons 
voted against the ordinance. </p>

<p><b>U.S. Sen. Salazar conducts public meeting on 'Village' </b></p> 
<p><b>James Robinson</b></p> 
<p><b>Staff Writer</b></p> 
<p>More than a 100 area residents turned out Monday at the Pagosa Springs 
Community Center to hear U.S. Sen. Ken Salazar speak about local issues, 
including fielding questions from the audience regarding the Village at Wolf 
Creek.</p> 
<p>Of those who questioned Salazar, none spoke in favor of the Village, and 
their concerns ranged from water issues, to issues of public safety, energy, 
and severe environmental degradation.</p> 
<p>During the discussion, Salazar said that United States Department of 
Agriculture Inspector General Phyllis Fong determined &quot;no improprieties 
occurred&quot; during the environmental impact statement (EIS) process, and 
that his aim was to visit constituents on both sides of the pass in order to 
hear their priorities and concerns.</p> 
<p>&quot;I take that (the inspector general's findings) for what it is. I have 
no way to question it,&quot; Salazar said.</p> 
<p>Salazar and other Colorado legislators requested an inspector general's 
investigation in May 2006 following allegations of collusion between the 
developer and Forest Service staff and to determine whether Village developer 
Billy Joe &quot;Red&quot; McCombs had wielded undue political influence during 
the EIS process.</p> 
<p>Ryan Demmy Bidwell of Colorado Wild, an environmental group which has long 
battled the controversial development, criticized Fong and the investigation 
process. </p> 
<p>&quot;If you don't look very far, you don't see very much.&quot; And he 
asked the Senator to help the United States Army Corps of Engineers &quot;stand 
their ground and demand a 404 permit.&quot;</p> 
<p>Fong released her findings in early September.</p> 
<p>Salazar said he understands the concerns of his constituents on both sides 
of Wolf Creek Pass.</p> 
<p>&quot;We have to balance out the economics on that side of the mountain 
with the environmental issues on this side of the mountain,&quot; Salazar said. 
&quot;You've had a developer come in and say 'It's my way or the highway,' and 
that's not good.&quot;</p> 
<p>During the discussion, Salazar criticized the EIS and said it failed to 
address impacts fundamental to a project slated for housing 10,000 people and 
2,100 homes at 10,000 feet. Salazar also questioned whether the 287.5-acre 
Village parcel adjacent to the Wolf Creek Ski Area had the capacity for such 
large-scale development.</p> 
<p>Among the EIS' chief shortcomings, Salazar said, was that the document 
failed to look beyond the construction of an access road and to assess the 
impact of the development as a whole.</p> 
<p>&quot;The construction of a road is not the development that will cause the 
environmental impact. The EIS should address the impact of the Village 
itself,&quot; said Salazar.</p> 
<p>Salazar suggested a significantly scaled down version of the project might 
be more palatable to area residents, however he emphasized the importance of 
assessing all impacts before any development occurred.</p> 
<p>&quot;I'm opposed to the proposal as it's configured, but is there some 
alternative?&quot; Salazar asked. </p> 
<p>Archuleta County Commissioner John Egan echoed Salazar's sentiments.</p> 
<p>&quot;A development of that size and scope doesn't make any sense,&quot; 
Egan said. And he suggested a possible solution might include the developer 
decreasing the size to a scope that could be &quot;palatable and discussed in 
real terms.&quot;</p> 
<p>Egan said before that discussion transpired however, McCombs and Village 
front man Bob Honts had some serious relationship mending to do with residents 
of Archuleta County. </p> 
<p>&quot;I would have to know the developer is respectfully and earnestly 
listening to Archuleta County,&quot; Egan said.</p> 
<p>Salazar said he will visit residents of the San Luis Valley to hear their 
side of the Village debate. </p>

<p><b>Michigan hunter dies in back country </b></p> 
<p><b>By Louis Sherman</b></p> 
<p><b>Staff Writer</b></p> 
<p>A Michigan man died suddenly Saturday afternoon while on a hunting trip 
near Clutter Mountain south of Pagosa Springs, from a &quot;probable heart 
attack,&quot; said Archuleta County Coroner Karl Macht.</p> 
<p>Eldon Cook, assumed by Macht to be in his late sixties (the coroner could 
not confirm a birth date), was an experienced hunter who spent many seasons in 
the Pagosa area.</p> 
<p>According to Macht, the heart attack occurred while Cook was field dressing 
an elk. Cook's hunting partner attempted CPR and contacted emergency personnel.
</p> 
<p>Due to timing, weather and difficult terrain, Archuleta County Emergency 
Operations was unable to send personnel into the backcountry Saturday.</p> 
<p>&quot;By the time we received the call, it was too late to put in anyone 
safely,&quot; said Greg Oertel of emergency operations.</p> 
<p>But despite snow and wet cold, Emergency Operations sent in a mounted 
search and rescue unit at first light, with Deputy Coroner Dick Cole, to bring 
Cook out.</p> 
<p>Cook was pronounced dead on the scene by Cole, who discerned the cause as a 
probable heart attack, said Macht.</p> 
<p>Macht said the search and rescue team and Cole responded well under 
difficult circumstances and conditions, and in the face of harsh terrain.</p> 
<p>&quot;I can't emphasize enough how important it is for agencies in the 
county to work together,&quot; he said.</p> 
<p>Macht also suggested that it was important for the families of the deceased 
to know that Cook died doing something that he loved.</p> 
<p>Emergency Operations extracted another hunter, an unidentified 57-year old 
Tulsa, Okla.,man with a broken ankle, out of the backcountry on the Turkey 
Creek Trail, near Jackson Mountain, on Monday, said Oertel.</p> 
<p>As described by Oertel, the search and rescue unit went in as far a 
possible on ATVs, then proceeded on foot. After stabilizing the hunter, they 
packed him down to a landing zone, where he could be airlifted out to Mercy 
Medical Center in Durango.</p>

<p><b>School district opposes amendment 39 </b></p> 
<p><b>By Louis Sherman</b></p> 
<p><b>Staff Writer</b></p> 
<p>Archuleta County School district 50 Jt. released a statement this week in 
opposition to proposed Amendment 39 to the Colorado Constitution on school 
district spending.</p> 
<p>The proposed amendment, to be voted on in the November general election, 
would require school districts across the state to spend at least 65 percent of 
their operating budgets on instruction costs, such as teachers, classroom 
computers, books and extracurriculars - with the hope of improving student 
achievement.</p> 
<p>Expenditures on support staff and services - including principals, 
counselors, nurses, transportation, food services, and teacher training - would 
not count toward the 65 percent requirement.</p> 
<p>The school district statement, prepared by Superintendent Duane Noggle, 
says the amendment would violate the principle of local control, as it limits 
the authority of elected board members to make decisions &quot;in the best 
interest of children,&quot; based on the particular needs of the local district.
</p> 
<p>&quot;The Board believes the concept of one size fits all is just plain 
wrong,&quot; the statement says.</p> 
<p>The district also argues in the statement that Amendment 39 would make it 
hard for schools to respond in the face of emergencies or unforeseen 
circumstances, saying that under the amendment schools could not hire 
additional security officers or counselors, in response to school violence; or 
health care providers, if a flu pandemic hit; or increase utility budgets, if 
fuel prices were to skyrocket - if the expenditures meant the district would 
not meet the 65 percent criteria.</p> 
<p>The district statement concludes, &quot;This amendment would have a 
tremendous impact on resource allocation and would do little to improve student 
success.&quot;</p>

<p><b>Stevens Field receives state aviation grant </b></p> 
<p>Colorado Gov. Bill Owens announced that Archuleta County has been awarded a 
state aviation grant totaling $192,719 for improvements at Stevens Field.</p> 
<p>The grant will be combined with $5.3 million of federal and/or local monies 
to fund taxiway construction and other improvements.</p> 
<p>According to Elmer Schettler, chairman of the Archuleta County Airport 
Advisory Commission, the grant money is designated for three projects: $40,000 
to a north ramp overlay; $25,000 as the state's portion for completed runway 
improvements undertaken last year; $127,000 for construction of a parallel 
taxiway in 2007.</p> 
<p>On Oct. 13, 43 state aviation grants totaling $3.85 million were awarded by 
the seven-member Colorado Aeronautical Board, which over the past decade has 
awarded nearly 500 grants totaling nearly $35 million to Colorado public-use 
airports. The grants are to be used solely for aviation purposes and are funded 
from aviation fuel tax revenues. This year the projects awarded total $67 
million in combined state, federal, and local funds.</p> 
<p>&quot;These aviation grant funds help Colorado's public-use airports bring 
in millions of dollars in federal project funds they might not otherwise be 
able to obtain,&quot; Gov. Owens noted. &quot;That's good news for our airports 
and for their communities, which depend on airports for quick and safe 
transportation as well as critical services such as flight-for-life and search 
and rescue. This program has been a big boost for our public-use airports for 
many years.&quot;</p> 
<p>Harold Patton of Greenwood Village, Colorado Aeronautical Board chair, 
called the grants &quot;a reliable fiscal resource for improving and 
maintaining Colorado's 78 public-use airports. These grants allow us to help 
create better airport safety and services.&quot;</p>

<p><b>State to provide incentives for job creation </b></p> 
<p>House Bill 1017, which was passed last legislative session, includes $3 
million for job creation performance based incentives.</p> 
<p>Businesses that create a minimum of five new jobs in rural areas and 10 in 
urban areas can receive the tax incentives.</p> 
<p>The Colorado Job Creation Performance Incentive Fund (PIF) and the Enhanced 
Incentive Program (EIP) amounts are determined by how much a business pays 
above the average county wage.</p> 
<p>Jobs will have to be created and maintained for at least one year before 
the business can receive any PIF or EIP incentives from the Economic 
Development Commission. Fifteen percent of the appropriate funding will be 
earmarked for job creation in Enterprise Zones outside the Denver Metro area, 
including southwest Colorado.</p> 
<p>Applications for the PIF and EIP are available online at

<p><b>Water conservancy district seeks to de-Bruce on November ballot </b></p> 
<p><b>By Chuck McGuire</b></p> 
<p><b>Staff Writer</b></p> 
<p>The San Juan Water Conservancy District is asking voters to approve Ballot 
Issue 5B in the Nov. 7 general election.</p> 
<p>According to proponents of 5B, approval of the issue would forever 
alleviate the district of revenue collection, retention and spending 
limitations imposed on it by Article X, Section 20 of the Colorado Constitution 
(the 1992 Taxpayer's Bill of Rights &#151; TABOR) and Section 29-1-301 of the 
Colorado Revised Statutes. It would also enable the district to effectively 
pursue development of future water rights and storage to accommodate projected 
growth.</p> 
<p>While TABOR restricts the amount of revenue the district can raise each 
year to an amount equal to inflation in the prior year, plus annual local 
growth (percentage of population), 29-1-301 C.R.S. caps allowable annual growth 
at 5.5 percent.</p> 
<p>Together, these controls now prevent the district from qualifying for 
available state funding needed to help finance construction of the proposed Dry 
Gulch Reservoir two miles outside of Pagosa Springs. The state has recently 
announced a $40 million fund payable over the next four years, which is 
designated solely for reservoir projects. The district believes a portion of 
that fund would be attainable, if 5B passes.</p> 
<p>Though no one filed written comments in opposition to 5B by the 
constitutional deadline, supporters also point out that, upon passage, it would 
not increase the current property tax mill levy without subsequent voter 
approval.</p> 
<p>As written, the ballot issue reads:</p> 
<p>&quot;Shall San Juan Water Conservancy District be authorized to collect, 
retain and spend all revenues and other funds received from all sources, 
including without limitation the district's existing general operating property 
tax, which property tax mill levy shall not be increased without voter 
approval, commencing January 1, 2006 and continuing thereafter until repealed, 
to be spent for general operations and capital improvements as a voter-approved 
revenue change, offset and exception to the limits which would otherwise apply 
under Article X, Section 20 of the Colorado Constitution or any other law, and 
as a permanent waiver of the 5.5 percent limitation under Section 29-1-301 
C.R.S.?&quot;</p>

existing circumstances, and a &quot;no&quot; vote is a vote against changing

<p><b>Larson endorses Sen. Jim Isgar </b></p> 
<p>Continuing with his independent way of doing business, Colorado Rep. Mark 
Larson (R-59th District) has endorsed another Democratic candidate - this time, 
his colleague from southwest Colorado, Sen. Jim Isgar.</p> 
<p>&quot;I have worked with Sen. Jim Isgar for about six years now and I want 
to tell voters why he is the only choice for representing us in the state 
senate,&quot; wrote Larson.</p> 
<p>&quot;I can honestly say that Jim Isgar is one of the quickest learners in 
the Legislature. He grasps the 'meat' of legislation quickly and is able to 
juggle several issues rapid fire. Jim's expertise on a broad range of issues 
(particularly water, agriculture and tourism) has earned him the respect of 
colleagues from both sides of the aisle.</p> 
<p>&quot;Having listened to my constituents in a responsive and candid manor, 
I was pleased to see that Jim was responsive and candid as well. He has not 
cared what party a constituent belonged to or whether they had status in the 
community. True representation requires that all constituents are listened to 
equally and given the same amount of attention. Jim Isgar did that and 
constituents never went without having their voice heard and/or ideas 
represented well in Denver.</p> 
<p>&quot;Finally, SW Colorado needs to have leadership in the Legislature ... 
leadership as defined by playing a major role within one's party, as well as 
leadership defined by standing up for the district when the party is not in 
sync with the district. Jim Isgar has met both of these definitions and I see 
no reason to change now.</p> 
<p>&quot;Readers may know that I once announced a race against Jim, 
withdrawing shortly after. I reasoned that if someone is doing the job and 
doing it well, then why not allow them to continue? The job is not about 
individuals, it is about effectively representing the district... and Jim Isgar 
has done that job exceedingly well. Jim Isgar is experienced and tested, but 
more importantly, he has proven that he deserves to continue representing us. 
Vote Isgar for Senate.&quot;</p>

<p><b>Staff Writer</b></p> 
<p>Pagosa Springs high school bands and choir will perform in their first of 
four concerts this year, Monday in the high school auditorium, beginning at 
7:30 p.m.</p> 
<p>The evening will begin with the concert band, followed by the jazz band and 
mixed choir.</p> 
<p>The Pirates have a strong musical tradition, with students routinely being 
honored as members of the all-state band and choir.</p> 
<p>This year, Kimberly Judd returns to the choir and band, after receiving 
all-state honors in both as a junior.</p> 
<p>The music department has sent many students on to be music majors and music 
teachers. Judd will likely enter a music program, while Pagosans Matt DeWinter 
and Chris Baum are now freshmen musicians at Fort Lewis and Berklee college of 
music, respectively.</p> 
<p>Pirates will compete for honors next Thursday in the Intermountain League 
Honor Band tryouts and at all-state choir tryouts later this month.</p>

<p><b>United Way in Archuleta County </b></p> 
<p><b>By Tom and Ming Steen</b></p> 
<p><b>Special to The SUN</b></p> 
<p>Demands and pressures on families have increased a lot in the last 
generation. In Archuleta County low wage rates and the high cost of living 
almost require that both parents work. Add to that the fact that the overall 
percentage of two-parent households continues to decline. Single parents often 
need multiple jobs to make ends meet. There is little question of the need for 
and importance of outside support for families.</p> 
<p>United Way in Archuleta County proposes to financially support three 
agencies that provide family support services with funds raised during its 
campaign this year. These agencies are Seeds of Learning, Community Connections 
and Southwest Safehouse.</p> 
<p>Seeds of Learning</p> 
<p>Seeds of Learning is a nonprofit corporation that began in Pagosa Springs 
in 1998 to meet the pressing needs of infant and preschool childcare and early 
childhood development. Seeds of Learning provides a nurturing, safe environment 
with a focus on developing social skills, meeting developmental needs and 
providing educational training and school readiness for children ages 18 months 
to five years.</p> 
<p>Since 2001 they have maintained an enrollment of 20, which is the maximum 
capacity for their current facility. Over 50% of enrollment is from low-income 
or at-risk families. Seeds of Learning is now in its eighth year of continuous 
operations and is the only center in Archuleta County that cares for toddlers 
as well as preschoolers. The toddler program helps to provide quality care for 
toddlers and support for their families.</p> 
<p>Lack of quality childcare in Archuleta County continues to be a huge 
challenge. From government statistics, Seeds of Learning staff estimates that 
in 2005 approximately 590 children under the age of 5 needed childcare in 
Archuleta County. However, fewer than 200 children can be cared for in existing 
licensed homes, centers, and preschools. Seeds of Learning continually operates 
at maximum enrollment capacity, and its waiting list for entry in April 2006 
was 56 children.</p> 
<p>Seeds of Learning began a capital campaign for an enlarged facility in 
2005. Community and institutional support has been great, and construction on 
this new building will begin soon. This new location will allow a 300% increase 
in enrollment; maximum enrollment will go from 20 to 60 children. This will 
help address the shortage of quality childcare in Archuleta County. </p> 
<p>Southwest Safehouse</p> 
<p>The Southwest Safehouse is the only residential domestic violence shelter 
in southwest Colorado. It provides emergency and long-term shelter for women 
and children survivors of domestic violence, rape, child abuse and other 
violent crimes. The Safehouse is open seven days a week, twenty-four hours a 
day. By offering secure shelter, three meals a day and counseling, the 
Safehouse meets its clients' basic needs and offers a forum for the victims to 
set and achieve their own personal goals.</p> 
<p>In the twenty-one years since opening, the Safehouse has sheltered 
approximately 4,600 women and children. In 2007 they expect to provide 
residential services to approximately 200 women and children with 5,475 nights 
of shelter. The Southwest Safehouse works closely with the Archuleta County 
Victims Assistance Program to identify local women and children in need of this 
service. In each of the past several years, approximately 7% of the Safehouse 
shelter services were provided to women and children from Archuleta County.</p> 
<p>Community Connections</p> 
<p>Community Connections helps to relieve the stress, both financial and 
emotional, that families encounter when they have a member with a developmental 
disability living in the family home. They provide financial support and 
resource coordination to families of children living in Southwest Colorado with 
developmental disabilities, learning disabilities, physical disabilities or 
sensory impairments. Four families in Archuleta County received family support 
services from Community Connections in 2005.</p> 
<p>The Community Connections Family Support Services Program is intended to 
assist families who have children with developmental disabilities with costs 
that are beyond those normally experienced by other families, and to avoid or 
delay costly out-of-home placements. Examples of services and supports include 
medical or dental expenses not funded by Medicaid or other insurance; respite 
care; special equipment, clothing or diets; home or vehicle modification; 
therapies; family counseling; and homemaker services.</p> 
<p>Having a child who is born prematurely or with a condition such as cerebral 
palsy, Down syndrome, epilepsy or autism changes the dynamics of the family in 
a way that has a huge and lasting effect on every member. Families' goals, 
hopes and dreams become centered on providing care and nurturing to their new 
member as they are forced to enter the often-confusing world of 
&quot;Developmental Disabilities.&quot; Without the guidance and support 
provided by Community Connections, these families face a future of frustration 
and uncertainty.</p> 
<p>United Way in Archuleta County hopes to raise $67,500 through donations 
during its current campaign. Part of this has been pledged to each of the above 
organizations to support their efforts to provide needed family support 
services in Archuleta County. Donations may be sent to United Way of Southwest 
Colorado, P.O. Box 4274, Pagosa Springs, CO 81147.</p> 
<p>Next week we will report on agency support for our senior citizens that 
United Way plans to assist with funds raised during this year's campaign in 
Archuleta County.</p>

<p><b>Look for ribbons, and Ripples of Hope </b></p> 
<p><b>By Carmen Hubbs</b></p> 
<p><b>Special to The SUN</b></p> 
<p>Our town is flooded with color - golden yellows, bright reds, radiant 
oranges, and vivid purple.</p> 
<p>Vivid purple? Yes, vivid purple - in the form of ribbons. </p> 
<p>October is Domestic Violence Awareness Month and purple awareness ribbons 
have been placed on trees all around our community. Each ribbon is dedicated to 
one victim who was supported by victim advocates of the Archuleta County Victim 
Assistance Program during 2005. A total of 286 ribbons will honor each victim's 
courage, strength and spirit.</p> 
<p>This year's theme, &quot;Ripples of Hope,&quot; in the shape of a tear, 
symbolizes the individual pain each victim endures, but the ripples together 
convert into hope - hope for healing and life without abuse.</p> 
<p>In 2005, advocacy centers around Colorado answered over 200,000 crisis and 
support calls to victims. Nearly 5,000 battered women and children fled their 
homes, seeking safe housing in Colorado shelters, with another 5,000 having to 
be turned away for lack of space.</p> 
<p>In Archuleta County, advocates answered more than 2,000 support calls, 
sheltering 13 women, children and men for nearly 30 nights.</p> 
<p>&quot;Domestic violence strikes at the heart of our society. We must stand 
together and say this violence will not be tolerated in our homes, our work, 
and our communities if we hope to end domestic violence in all its forms,&quot; 
says Nancy Osborn Nicholas of the Colorado Coalition Against Domestic Violence.
</p> 
<p>Create your own Ripples of Hope by learning more about domestic violence, 
teaching your children about healthy relationships based on respect, and how 
you can help stop it if you see something that concerns you. Call 264-9075 for 
more information.</p>

<p><b>Breast cancer support group forming in Pagosa Springs </b></p> 
<p><b>By Kathi DeClark</b></p> 
<p><b>Special to The SUN</b></p> 
<p>Sam Conti, a licensed professional counselor with over 20 years experience 
in the mental health field and with support groups for woman survivors of 
gender violence, is starting a breast cancer support group in Pagosa Springs.
</p> 
<p>The group will meet once a month, at 4 p.m. on the second Sunday of the 
month at Conti's office in the Pagosa Springs Family Medicine Clinic on South 
Pagosa Boulevard. This group is for the newly diagnosed, and those who have 
trudged this road before. Everyone has something to share. Anyone interested 
should plan to attend.</p> 
<p>Conti was diagnosed with a stage 2 B Lobar Carcinoma of the left breast 
almost eight years ago. After she had a complete left mastectomy, she went 
through a series of chemotherapy, and 47 days of radiation. She did this all 
the while working in Ignacio as the clinical supervisor at Peaceful Spirit 
Treatment Center.</p> 
<p>&quot;It was quite a struggle. If I hadn't had my friends and others that 
had gone before me, I couldn't have made it,&quot; said Conti. She went on to 
say, &quot;I am so grateful every day for my life and for the experience I had 
with cancer, as I came out so far ahead of where I was. I learned so much about 
myself and I grew spiritually. I have so much to give thanks for today. The 
opportunity to facilitate this group will be one more opportunity to give back 
what I have gained. Won't you join us to share your questions, strength and 
hope with others?&quot;</p>

<p><b>Habitat for Humanity holds successful fund-raiser </b></p> 
<p><b>By Janis Moomaw</b></p> 
<p><b>Special to The SUN</b></p> 
<p>Habitat for Humanity of Archuleta County recently held its annual 
fund-raiser at the community center. </p> 
<p>The evening started with a dinner catered by Wildflower Catering, served by 
members of the Pagosa Springs High School football team. President Bob Moomaw 
thanked the team for helping Habitat with the fund-raiser and passed a bucket 
around for donations for the teams' new uniforms.</p> 
<p>The evening continued with dancing to the High Rollers. </p> 
<p>Merchants from the community of Pagosa Springs donated gift certificates, 
clothing, lights, tools, tickets to the hot springs and ski passes, plus many 
other items. </p> 
<p>Money raised by Habitat for Humanity of Archuleta County is used to build 
affordable houses in Archuleta County. This year, the fund-raiser was changed 
from a luncheon to a dinner dance and was by far the organization's most 
successful fund-raising event ever. Habitat raised over $25,000 thanks to the 
generosity of Pagosa residents.</p> 
<p>Members of Habitat would like to thank BootJack Ranch for a very generous 
donation that will go towards funding a new administrative director. Tim 
Horning also made a nice annual pledge towards the administrative director's 
salary. Anyone wishing to contributive towards the administrative director's 
salary should contact Bob Moomaw at 264-3010. With a new administrative 
director, the goal is to expand building capacity from one house per year to 
three or four houses per year.</p> 
<p>The following business and individuals were table sponsors at the 
fund-raiser: Hart Construction, Hart's Rocky Mt. Retreat, Pagosa Springs SUN, 
Pagosa Springs Rotary Club, Bob and Janis Moomaw, KWUF Radio, Parelli Natural 
Horsemanship, Galles Fine Properties, Appraisal Services, Clarion Mortgage, 
Jean and David Smith, Terry Jackson, Bank of Colorado, San Juan Appraiser 
Group, Ears 2 U, Paint Connection, New Mark Landscape, Four Season Land Co., 
Kiwanis, Citizens Bank, Jack and Katy Threet, Stacia Kemp, Jack and Claudia 
Rosenbaum, Alley House, Farrago Market Caf&eacute;, and Bill and Fran Smith.</p>

sincerely thanks these generous donors, without whom the organization would not 
be able to provide affordable housing. Thanks also go to Joann Irons, Sharon 
Crump and Jody Cromwell for their generous donation of time and expertise that 
helped make this fund-raiser so successful.</p> 
<p>Habitat will hold a spring wine and cheese event to energize volunteers for 
another building season. Habitat will begin its 16th home in May 2007. Plan on

<p><b>Mountain High gardeners create garden at community center </b></p> 
<p><b>By Denise Rue-Pastin</b></p> 
<p><b>Special to The SUN</b></p> 
<p>With seed money from the Pagosa Area Water and Sanitation District (PAWSD), 
the Mountain High Gardeners Club recently completed work on a xeriscape&#153; 
demonstration garden at the Pagosa Springs Community Center.</p> 
<p>Xeriscape&#153; is a term coined by the Denver Water Department in the mid 
1980s and refers to low water use gardening. It should be noted that the 
xeriscape&#153; concept is now recognized around the world and is celebrating 
it's 25th anniversary.</p> 
<p>Although PAWSD has a beautiful xeriscape&#153; demonstration garden at its 
facility (100 Lyn Ave.), which anyone is welcome to tour at any time, it was 
felt that a demonstration garden was warranted that was more centrally located 
and accessible to the public.</p> 
<p>With that in mind, PAWSD donated $500 in 2005 to the Mountain High 
Gardeners Club. The club subsequently allocated $250 each for work at the 
Senior Center location and at the Ruby Sisson Library.</p> 
<p>Under the competent leadership of Ron Chacey, work first commenced on soil 
amendments at the community center site. Multiple loads of llama manure were 
donated by the Sharp family. In addition, Paul Hansen donated composted 
sawdust. Topsoil was delivered and donated by the Town of Pagosa Springs under 
the stewardship of Jim Miller. The manure, compost and topsoil were tilled in 
by volunteers of the garden club. Three trees were then planted. Chacey and 
Miller relocated five large boulders to add hardscape to the garden. Bonnie and 
Larry Sprague, owners of High Plains Nursery, provided the trees and plants 
that garden club volunteers planted.</p> 
<p>This was a team effort that could not have happened without the help of 
many dedicated individuals. Thanks go to all who participated. Visit the new 
garden and enjoy its beauty as it grows to maturity.</p>

<p><b>Staff Writer</b></p> 
<p>The Pagosa Ranger District/Field Office of the San Juan National Forest 
will host a public field trip to the Jackson Mountain area Saturday.</p> 
<p>Anyone interested in observing and discussing related forest conditions is 
invited to attend.</p> 
<p>The trip will run from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m., during which forest officials 
will unveil plans to respond to local forest health concerns over a multi-year 
period. Planned responses might include forest thinning in the forms of 
commercial logging, mowing and/or prescribed burning of approximately 1,500 
acres.</p> 
<p>Field trip participants should bring a lunch and dress appropriately for 
adverse weather conditions and, with hunters in the field, a blaze orange hat 
or vest is advisable.</p> 
<p>Those coming from town should meet at the district field office at 180 
Pagosa St., Pagosa Springs at 10:30 a.m. Those coming from northeast of town, 
including the San Juan River Resort area, can meet at the Jackson Mountain Road 
turnoff at 11 a.m.</p>

<p><b>Hunters asked to be cautious on wet roads </b></p> 
<p>Heavy rains in southwest Colorado during the last two weeks are making for 
wet conditions in the high country during the start of the state's big game 
hunting seasons. Hunters are urged to stay on dry roads and avoid soggy areas 
with vehicles.</p> 
<p>&quot;We're asking hunters to exercise good judgment on where they take 
their vehicles,&quot; said Tony Gurzick, southwest assistant regional manager 
for the Colorado Division of Wildlife. &quot;Heavy vehicles can seriously 
damage wet roads and affect access to hunting areas. Runoff from deep road ruts 
can damage water quality and wildlife habitat.&quot;</p> 
<p>Western Colorado was particularly hard-hit by the rains which swelled 
rivers and creeks, and caused some flooding and rock slides.</p> 
<p>The first rifle season for elk started Saturday, Oct. 14, and thousands of 
hunters headed to Colorado's high country. The first season continued through 
Oct. 18. Other rifle seasons follow until mid-November.</p> 
<p>When setting up camp, hunters should drive off the road as short a distance 
as possible. Hunters also are reminded that all-terrain vehicles can cause 
resource damage.</p> 
<p>Hunters are advised to contact local United States Forest Service and 
Bureau of Land Management offices to check on road closures and restrictions.
</p> 
<p>Hunters are asked to report road problems to wildlife officers or to 
federal agency officers.</p> 
<p>&quot;Forest roads are paid for with your tax dollars. Road repairs are 
very expensive,&quot; Gurzick said. &quot;So hunters and anyone using the roads 
are asked to treat them with care.&quot;</p> 
<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p> 
<p><b>DOW seeks landowners for walk-in access program</b></p> 
<p>The &quot;Walk-in Access Program&quot; sponsored by the Colorado Division 
of Wildlife to provide hunters access to private land to hunt small game is 
expanding to western Colorado.</p> 
<p>Property owners who participate in the program are eligible to earn from $5 
to $20 per acre depending on the amount of property available for hunting. In 
southwest Colorado the DOW is asking property owners to consider providing 
access for spring turkey hunting.</p> 
<p>The walk-in program has been in place for many years on Colorado's eastern 
plains. In that region, private landowners allow hunters access to hundreds of 
thousands of acres of land.</p> 
<p>While most of the land in western Colorado is publicly owned, thousands of 
acres of private property are located in prime wildlife habitat.</p> 
<p>Enrolled properties will be clearly marked with Division of Wildlife 
&quot;Walk-in Access&quot; signs and their locations published in a walk-in 
atlas. Landowners are not identified in the atlas. Access to enrolled 
properties is by foot only. No vehicles or horses are permitted.</p> 
<p>The program is funded through sales of a mandatory Walk-In Access program 
permit which will be available for $20 at all DOW offices and all hunting and 
fishing license vendors. Enforcement of regulations is the responsibility of 
the DOW. All normal hunting regulations apply on Walk-In Access properties.</p> 
<p>Interested landowners should contact their local district wildlife manager 
or the nearest DOW office for more information. Landowners in Archuleta County 
should contact the Durango area office at 247-0855.</p>

<p><b>Tamarisk Control Bill signed into law</b></p> 
<p>U.S. Sen. Wayne Allard (R-Colo.) has announced that President Bush has 
signed legislation designed for the control and eradication of the salt cedar 
plant, also known as the tamarisk.</p> 
<p>&quot;The tamarisk is causing severe problems throughout Colorado and the 
West,&quot; said Allard. &quot;The President's signing of this legislation 
marks a major milestone in the ongoing effort by Congress and this 
administration to provide critical resources for the removal of this 
destructive and invasive species.&quot;</p> 
<p>The tamarisk has invaded the margins of streams, lakes and wetlands 
throughout the Western United States. An individual plant can consume up to 200 
gallons of water per day, which has exacerbated drought conditions in the West, 
and is highly disruptive to native habitats and species.</p> 
<p>&quot;Eradication of this unquenchable shrub will save water, lower 
salinity levels and create a more congenial habitat for the Southwest Willow 
Flycatcher and a number of other riparian species in Colorado and across the 
West,&quot; Allard said. &quot;This is an important element in mitigating the 
water shortages and environmental damage associated with the tamarisk.&quot;</p>
<p>Tamarisk Coalition Executive Director Tim Carlson also voiced his 
appreciation for Sen. Allard's years of hard work on this issue. &quot;The 
passage of this legislation is a major step in reversing the devastating 
impacts that tamarisk causes to the state's river systems. It took the recent 
drought for us to realize the incredible value of Colorado's water resources 
and associated wildlife habitat,&quot; said Carlson. &quot;This bill will help 
restore and protect these assets. Colorado's strong congressional leadership, 
especially from Senator Allard and his staff, was critical in passing this 
legislation.&quot;</p> 
<p>The bill authorizes the provision of grants worth millions of dollars to 
states and public/private partnerships to control and eradicate the tamarisk. 
The Senate passed the House version of the bill, H.R. 2720, which is the 
companion to the Senate bill, S. 177. Allard was an original cosponsor of the 
Senate bill with U.S. Sen. Pete Domenici (R-N.M.).</p>

<p><b>Hunting test goes to the dogs at Navajo Lake State Park </b></p> 
<p>Every dog has his day, and that day will arrive for dozens of retrievers 
competing for the chance to be referred to as &quot;master&quot; - during the 
American Kennel Club's (AKC) Retriever Hunt Test at Navajo Lake State Park 
Saturday, Oct. 28, and Sunday, Oct. 29.</p> 
<p>Six judges (three from New Mexico) from the American Kennel Club, 
Albuquerque Retriever Club and Labrador Retriever Club will judge dozens of 
retrievers' hunting and retrieval skills at the event.</p> 
<p>To earn points towards a coveted title, canines will be required to locate 
and retrieve a number of simulated ducks, planted throughout the area. Based on 
the number of birds retrieved, the dogs will advance to: Junior level (one bird 
retrieved), Senior level (two birds retrieved) or Master level (three birds 
retrieved.)</p> 
<p>Each run can extend up to 100 yards and tests the canines' agility, 
retrieval skills and hunting abilities.</p> 
<p>&quot;We're excited to offer yet another recreational opportunity for 
visitors, as we host this event,&quot; said Steve Mueller, park superintendent.
</p> 
<p>Navajo Lake State Park and the neighboring San Juan River were chosen this 
year because of their ideal location, which provides a realistic setting 
complete with obstacles - such as ponds and a lake.</p> 
<p>&quot;Navajo is a central location in the four corners area and convenient 
for hunters from neighboring states,&quot; said Cheryl Heit, one of six AKC 
judges. &quot;We're thrilled that State Parks' staff have been eager to work 
with us on this event - they've been wonderful.&quot;</p> 
<p>So far, nearly 50 hunters from New Mexico, Texas, Arizona, Utah, and 
Colorado have registered for the competition. Those interested in entering 
their retriever into the Hunt Test should contact Wendy Statkus, vice president 
of Albuquerque Retrievers Club, as soon as possible at (505) 238-4180.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p> <b>High Country Reflections</b> 
<p></p> 
<p><b>Indeed, it was a great escape </b></p> 
<p><b>By Chuck McGuire</b></p> 
<p><b>SUN Columnist</b></p> 
<p>Even with the sun finally in full view, the numbing cold of a mid-October 
dawn lingered in my fingers and toes. Facing east, as the sun's slanting rays 
glistened through the ponderosas before me, I could feel the slightest warmth 
on my face, yet I was still freezing. I had to move.</p> 
<p>I'd been hunting elk near 10,000 feet on the Uncompahgre Plateau, and 
sitting motionless in the crisp mountain air for too long a time had taken its 
toll. At one point, I stood up and walked in short circles to stimulate blood 
flow to the extremities, but when a dozen wapiti cows and calves suddenly 
appeared at the top of a shallow draw to the south, I froze again - both 
literally and figuratively.</p> 
<p>It was opening day of the first combined deer and elk rifle season, and I 
had a license to harvest a cow elk. I'd obtained it in a state drawing for a 
particular game management unit on the plateau, and if necessary, I planned to 
hunt for nine days.</p> 
<p>Admittedly though, as a hunter of small game for years, especially upland 
birds, I'd never killed a big game animal before, and wasn't exactly crazy 
about the idea. Neither field dressing it or properly caring for the meat were 
my concerns, I'd assisted fellow hunters with both on previous outings. I had 
just reached a point in my life where deciding who lived or died became 
increasingly difficult and consequently, found myself inadvertently passing on 
viable opportunities to take the shot.</p> 
<p>For instance, while only a hundred yards distant, I probably could have 
taken a cow in that first encounter an hour earlier, but, for whatever reason, 
I simply watched as the entire band of amazingly nimble ungulates moved so 
eloquently through the trees, pausing from time to time, before disappearing 
over a ridge to the east.</p> 
<p>Afterward, I thought, what the heck. There's no pressure. It's the first of 
several days in the field and as much as anything, I'm here to enjoy the quiet 
and solitude. Certainly, there will be other opportunities. Besides, I need to 
warm up and reenergize, perhaps with a bite to eat back at camp.</p> 
<p>I'd set camp the day before on an undeveloped 40-acre tract of land a few 
miles southwest, as a crow flies. At 8,700 feet in elevation, the parcel is 
part of a small and secluded subdivision surrounded by national forest. Three 
friends own it, and I've enjoyed an open invitation to bivouac there, for much 
of the past 30 years. Because the property is part of an adjacent game 
management unit, I could not hunt there.</p> 
<p>The property, like miles of surrounding countryside, is largely wild and 
unsettled. Mostly covered with mature aspens, it also bears open meadows and 
sporadic stands of giant ponderosa pines left over from commercial logging 
operations of decades past. To the immediate south, a broad clearing affords 
sweeping views of the lofty San Miguel Mountains and, as part of a western 
branch of the San Juans, Mount Sneffels dominates the southeastern horizon.</p> 
<p>I pulled into camp by mid-morning. The 20-minute truck ride, along with a 
final cup of coffee from my thermos, had warmed me enough to shed outer jacket 
and hat, then swap pack boots for moccasins. The bright autumn sun, now much 
higher in the cloudless azure sky, spilled its warming rays over the campsite 
and the entire woodland landscape beyond.</p> 
<p>As camps go, this was the model of efficiency. In a small clearing amid the 
tallest of aspens, two 8-by-10 tents faced each other, with approximately eight 
feet of space between them. One served as sleeping quarters, while the other 
held assorted hunting and fishing equipment, cooking and dining utensils, water 
jugs and extra fuel. A propane lantern dangled from the ceiling of each, while 
the sleeper included a braided rug, propane heater, cot, and small folding 
table and chair.</p> 
<p>A large tarp covered the gap between tents, where another table, cook 
stove, dish tub and lantern served as camp kitchen. A dozen feet beyond, an 
established fire circle and evening burns of crackling aspen provided warmth in 
the &quot;open-air&quot; living room.</p> 
<p>Most days my appetite is slow to start, and opening day was no different. 
In the rush to be in position for the morning hunt, I managed only coffee, a 
piece of fruit and granola bar, before heading over a series of two-track roads 
in the predawn darkness. But once back in camp, I was starving, and quickly 
devoured an English muffin and large bowl of cereal. That became my morning 
routine for the next few days.</p> 
<p>While eating breakfast, I thought about the elk I'd seen earlier and 
contemplated the feasibility of hunting mid-day hours. I remembered how, in 
years past, my friends and I had stalked the woods throughout each day, 
returning to camp only after nightfall and, while fairly exhausted, preparing 
evening meals before turning in for the night. I recalled the few animals we'd 
collectively harvested, and remembered how each was taken early, or very late 
in the day.</p> 
<p>I also considered the fatigue factor. While presumably hunting, I was on 
vacation after a grueling stretch of work, and needed down time. Even if I 
hadn't drawn a cow tag, I'd have camped, fished and walked the woods for 
several days. With that in mind, I decided to hunt the early mornings, fish or 
hike during the day, and see what appealed by evening.</p> 
<p>As it turned out, I hunted just three consecutive mornings, before shifting 
focus to fishing and leisurely late-day walks. Hunting meant getting up well 
before dawn, driving in the dark and venturing into the freezing cold, just to 
compete with dozens of other hunters for a chance to &#138; well &#138; kill 
something. After a few outings, I realized that, more than anything, I just 
longed for silence and seclusion.</p> 
<p>Stream fishing, on the other hand, was practical anytime of day. 
Competition was negligible, and by using artificial flies with single barbless 
hooks, I could release whatever I caught, without inflicting mortal injury.</p> 
<p>Over the course of the following week, my most enjoyable hours spent were 
in the privacy of camp, or on solitary walks through the surrounding forest. 
Affording the liberty to roam miles in any direction, the area sees minimal 
human activity. I never saw another person the entire time I was there, but on 
two separate occasions, while sitting outside the tents sipping coffee, I 
turned in response to a slight rustling of leaves, only to see a couple of mule 
deer bucks browsing just 50 yards through the trees.</p> 
<p>Though deer were common as squirrels, small bands of elk were not exactly 
rare. One evening, while wandering just minutes from camp, I managed to creep 
to within easy viewing of a pair of bugling bulls, as they squared off in 
rivalry over a dozen cows.</p> 
<p>That same evening, as I lay in bed listening to soft breezes wafting 
through the pines and now leafless aspens, a distant pack of coyotes let loose 
with a long series of yips and yowls. I listened for several minutes, before 
drifting off to sleep, but sometime later, they aroused me again, while 
scurrying about just outside the tents. At one point, I could hear at least one 
actually sniffing a tent corner, just feet from where I lay.</p> 
<p>More often than not, following a long morning walk, I ate a sandwich and 
chips, then drove an hour over gravel forest roads to the San Miguel River. 
With several public reaches to choose from, I found ample places devoid of 
other anglers, and spent a couple of hours casting for an equal mix of rainbows 
and browns. The river is easily negotiable, and catching its trout is just 
challenging enough to provide great sport three seasons a year.</p> 
<p>In every excursion to the great outdoors, there invariably comes a time 
when home and civilization hold renewed appeal. Doing dishes by hand, or 
bathing outside, becomes cumbersome and challenging, particularly when the 
clouds roll in and a stiff breeze kicks up. Meanwhile, a desire for the company 
of family and friends steadily swells within me, and I look forward to real 
conversation.</p> 
<p>Therefore, after nine days alone and talking to myself, I eagerly broke 
camp one sunny morning, and packed the truck for the trip home. As always, I 
took a last stroll around the property, then pulled onto the dirt two-track 
toward Montrose and the highway beyond.</p> 
<p>While failing to &quot;harvest&quot; an elk, I succeeded in regaining 
equilibrium. I managed to catch fish, relax and revel in the glory of the 
woods. As I drove, I thought, what began as a big game hunting trip, turned 
triumphantly to a great escape.</p> 
<p><b>&nbsp;</b><b>Letters</b></p> 
<p></p> 
<p><b>Electoral College</b></p> 
<p>Dear Editor:</p> 
<p>This letter is in response to that small part of Dave Blake's letter, 
&quot;Tcch, tcch,&quot; Oct. 12 SUN, in which he wasn't directly insulting you 
for your editorial in an earlier edition.</p> 
<p>In the second paragraph Blake writes, &quot;Fear of rapid change lead (sic) 
to the institution of the 'Electoral College,' an electoral process that 
allowed the election of more than one non-democratically elected president (say 
hay George).&quot; That is the first time I have heard the creation the 
Electoral College attributed to &quot;fear of rapid change.&quot; The fear was 
that the less-populated states would not ratify the proposed constitution if 
the election of the president was by a nation-wide popular vote.</p> 
<p>The founders formed, and we still are, a federal union of states. Each 
state gets to say who it wants to be president. The more-populated states have 
an overwhelming advantage. California has 55 electoral votes while seven states 
have only three; three in the east and four in the west.</p> 
<p>In 2000 Vice President Al Gore got 539,947 more votes than Mr. George W. 
Bush, former governor of Texas. The outcome depended on who got Florida's 
electoral votes. That is history and Blake obviously hasn't gotten over it yet.
</p> 
<p>In 2004 President Bush got 3,012,449 more votes than Senator Kerry. The 
outcome depended on who got Ohio's electoral votes. President Bush got them and 
is serving a second term.</p> 
<p>If Senator Kerry had won Ohio, he would have become president, even though 
he trailed in the nation's popular vote by over 3 million votes. I doubt that 
Blake would be unhappy about that.</p>

<p><b>&nbsp;</b><b>CYA</b></p> 
<p>Dear Editor:</p> 
<p>U.S. Sen. Ken Salazar came to Pagosa Monday for 30 minutes of listening to 
constituents. When asked why he voted for the Military Commission Act of 2006, 
Sen. Salazar answered that it was an attempt to join with Sen. McCain in 
prohibiting torture by our government. His understanding of the effects of this 
bill, signed Tuesday by the president, was clear. He acknowledged the current 
government has the power now to label anyone an enemy combatant. He further 
acknowledged the bill he signed cancels the writ of Habeas Corpus.</p> 
<p>Every U.S. citizen should be outraged by this bill. Any of us can now be 
detained at the pleasure of the government, without offenses named, for an 
indefinite period of time, without counsel, without notification to anyone, 
without a right to trial, without knowing who our accusers are. This bill 
nullifies seven of the 10 Bill of Rights guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution. 
This bill cancels 600 years of civil rights since the signing of the Magna 
Carta in 1215. Our founding fathers and the Continental Army began a revolution 
200 plus years ago to give us these rights. And now they are gone.</p> 
<p>Why was this bill brought forward? By reiterating a 50-year commitment to 
the Geneva Convention this legislation traded our most basic freedoms. This 
bill was a CYA (cover your a--) attempt to protect the administration from 
conviction as war criminals. Why would a U.S. Senator from the Democratic party 
want to participate in this legislation? Why would any elected official vote to 
betray the citizens?</p> 
<p>Is it time for a Tea Party? </p> 
<p>P.S. His brother, U.S. Rep. John Salazar also voted for this legislation.

<p>Arlene Marcus</p> 
<p><b>&nbsp;</b><b>Prosaic explanation</b></p> 
<p>Dear Editor:</p> 
<p>I read with growing alarm Judy Humphreys' letter describing her experience 
in Town Park. She &quot;tiptoed&quot; through a &quot;minefield&quot; of a 
&quot;huge number of dog droppings&quot; and suggested the Town would do well 
to place dispensers of pick-up bags in its parks.</p> 
<p>Although it is certainly possible that an errant dropping does elude our 
scrutiny, the parks crew considers the removal of canine essence an important 
aspect of our duties, so the presence of such quantities of it mystified me.</p>
<p>There are dispensers of plastic bags in prominent locations throughout our 
parks, and the rate at which they require replenishment indicates their 
popularity, though I guess it's possible they are being used by thrifty moms to 
wrap the kid's sandwiches. But a plethora of poo has never presented itself 
since we installed the Mutt Mitt containers, thanks to conscientious dog 
owners. Whence, then, Ms. Humphreys' minefield?</p> 
<p>Two or three times per year, to benefit the microbial health of our turf, 
we perform an operation known as core aeration. Our tractor pulls an implement 
equipped with an array of tines, which punch into the soil four to six inches 
deep and pull out cores or &quot;plugs&quot; of soil, allowing the surrounding 
grass roots to breathe. The plugs are three to four inches long, three-quarters 
of an inch in diameter, and a rich, earthy brown color. They have been 
regularly mistaken for dog droppings. Our last aeration of Town Park was at the 
end of September.</p> 
<p>Like the &quot;crop circles&quot; which mysteriously appear annually just 
before soccer season, the seasonal proliferation of poop has a prosaic 
explanation. I hope this information reaches those citizens whose concern about 
the state of our parks informs our efforts on a frequent basis.</p> 
<p>Keep visiting those public spaces, folks, and keep a sharp eye out for the 
inevitable oversights and omissions we commit. Keep those cards and letters 
coming in, and we will continue our efforts to beautify, and sanitize, our 
parks. </p> 
<p>Sincerely,</p> 
<p>Jim Miller</p> 
<p><b>&nbsp;</b><b>Perspective</b></p> 
<p>Dear Editor: </p> 
<p>It may be useful to provide a brief historical perspective on the 
college-in-Archuleta-County idea.</p> 
<p>Those of you who have been paying attention to local educational issues 
know this is not a new idea. Pueblo Community College (PCC) has had a 
meaningful presence in Pagosa Springs - through beneficial partnerships with 
the Archuleta County School District and the Archuleta County Education Center 
- for most of the past 15 years. Many Pagosa Springs High School students have 
graduated with transferable college courses on their transcripts by taking PCC 
&quot;dual credit&quot; classes while attending school here. Pagosa Springs 
High School has also provided classroom space after hours and allowed many of 
its masters-qualified teachers to &quot;moonlight&quot; as instructors for 
evening PCC classes that have benefited many in the community over the years. 
The Education Center has provided an administrative home base - offering office 
space for PCC liaison personnel, assisting with diagnostic intake testing, 
registration, marketing, remedial education, et al.</p> 
<p>Because of changes in state financing, high schools in Pagosa, Durango, 
Bayfield, and Mancos recently pulled out of the PCC dual credit program. Pagosa 
Springs High School has actively worked to replace this with a similar 
arrangement with the CSU Pueblo's &quot;Senior to Sophomore Core Program.&quot; 
They are currently in the second semester of offering dual-credit courses 
through CSU Pueblo and expect this program to expand. PCC has continued to 
schedule evening classes, but demand is low. A minimum number of enrolled 
students (FTE) is required before a class is economically feasible. With 
insufficient student interest, classes are subsequently cancelled.</p> 
<p>Without a cohort of like-minded individuals pursuing a common goal, local 
demand for college courses (outside of the high-school dual credit program) 
does not allow very many courses to survive. A group of local early childhood 
educators, for example, began pursuing a degree in tandem and were able to take 
much of their coursework locally. Fortunately, a wide range of online 
post-secondary degrees and courses are currently available from different 
colleges and universities for the motivated student. PCC plans to offer 
&quot;hybrid&quot; online courses in Pagosa that will involve e-mail 
communication with an instructor plus occasional face-to-face contact.</p> 
<p>Yes, it would be great to have community and vocational/technical college 
facilities in Pagosa Springs for the benefit of all. However, recent real-life 
experience should give us pause by offering a sobering perspective on the 
current feasibility and financial reality of fantasizing about a community 
college campus for Archuleta County right now.</p> 
<p>Tom Steen </p> 
<p><b>&nbsp;</b><b>Concerned</b></p> 
<p>Dear Editor:</p> 
<p>Taxpayers should be very concerned with the upcoming local ballot issue on 
the county's mill stabilization issue. If it passes, each taxpayer's bill will 
increase.</p> 
<p>Under current law, the county is governed by the provisions of the Tabor 
Amendment to the Constitution. While the provisions are complicated, basically 
the county can only increase its yearly spending by 5 percent. If the county 
collects more than that amount in property taxes, the excess amount must be 
refunded to the taxpayers, either by check or by credit on your tax bill. Our 
county currently credits each of us on our bill.</p> 
<p>If the local ballot issue passes, Tabor will no longer apply. The county 
will keep all of the property tax revenue and is no longer limited to a 
5-percent budget increase. You will no longer receive any tax credit, and your 
taxes will increase accordingly. Beginning in the 2008 tax year, your taxes 
will increase substantially, because property values in the county have 
increased by at least 30 percent. Your taxes will increase due to your 
increased property value.</p> 
<p>Before the county is allowed to increase taxes, it should get its own house 
in order. County expenses are out of control. According to the county's own 
records, just personnel costs increased in 2004 by 9.36 percent, in 2005 by 
30.57 percent, and in 2006 by 14.69 percent. Equipment expense has also 
increased greatly. How many of you have seen your income increase by these 
amounts? Before the county should increase taxes, let them control expenses.</p>
<p>Taxpayers of metro districts will be especially affected. Any increase in 
county taxes will not be applied to your roads. In fact, assuming the county 
will use some of the additional taxes for county road improvements, metro 
districts will get less funding from the state to maintain your roads since you 
are in competition for the state money with the county. The better the county 
roads, the less money for metro districts. You will not only be paying more 
taxes to the county, you will have to increase your metro district taxes to 
maintain the same quality of roads in your district.</p> 
<p>I am not against all tax increases. For example, the tax issue concerning 
property purchase for a county reservoir is necessary for our future water 
supply. However, this mill stabilization measure has not been properly thought 
out. Please vote &quot;No&quot; on this issue.</p>

<p><b>'Our Library,' from 1896 to now </b></p> 
<p><b>By Carole Howard</b></p> 
<p><b>Special to The PREVIEW</b></p> 
<p>What's in a name? </p> 
<p>Some people just call it The Library. Or they call it Our Library. Some 
call it the Pagosa Library - but that's not entirely accurate, as it serves all 
of Archuleta County. The name on the sign out front is Ruby M. Sisson Memorial 
Library. And the official name for tax purposes is the Upper San Juan Library 
District.</p> 
<p>Regardless of what name you choose, our library is a center of learning and 
life-long self-education, a resource for every citizen in the county from 
babies to seniors, students to retirees.</p> 
<p>As many of its patrons will tell you, it also is a very fun place to go for 
special programs. And, as its first librarian Lenore Bright points out, it has 
changed with the times.</p> 
<p>&quot;Technology advances have affected every aspect of library 
service,&quot; Bright said. &quot;We can now consider the physical library an 
'information commons' with books and computers sharing the same space - a 
reminder to us all that valuable information comes in many forms.&quot;</p> 
<p><b>Library launched with gifts of books</b></p> 
<p>Our library actually started in 1896 with the personal collection of local 
attorney Frank Spickard. He made his books available to a young ladies' 
literary club whose members loved reading.</p> 
<p>Meanwhile, a few years earlier a wealthy Methodist had died in New York, 
and his estate donated 48 books to be used as a library in Pagosa Springs. On 
Feb. 22, 1907, the collections merged and the Pagosa Springs Public Library 
opened in the basement of the Methodist Church.</p> 
<p>At first the library was run by women volunteers. Then in February of 1910, 
the Woman's Civic Club was formed. Its members - again, all volunteers - took 
over operation of the library, which by then had a collection of 202 books. 
From 1910 until 1960, the Civic Club ran the library which, after residing in 
the church, moved to a log cabin and then to the town hall on the river.</p> 
<p>In 1960, Civic Club members helped pay for a new town hall on the corner of 
U.S. 160 and Lewis Street. In 1966, Archuleta County took over the library. But 
they had very little money so the library became a &quot;line item&quot; in the 
county budget, receiving minimal financial support.</p> 
<p><b>Searching for a permanent home</b> </p> 
<p>It remained the goal of the Civic Club to provide a permanent home for the 
library. Its members continued to give major support to the library, and 
donations were always important to keep the collection expanding.</p> 
<p>In 1963, the Friends of the Library organization was formed to involve 
others with fund-raising for a permanent facility. It was not until l983 that 
Lenore Bright was hired as our first full-time librarian. In 1985, the Upper 
San Juan Library District was formed to give the library a stable 1.5 mill levy 
funding base, and the county no longer provided funds for its operation.</p> 
<p>On Feb. 7, 1989 the library opened debt free on its current site, thanks to 
the Civic Club and Friends of the Library jointly raising more than $700,000 
and Robert Lindner's donation of the property. At Lindner's request, it was 
named the Ruby M. Sisson Memorial Library after a long-time supporter who was a 
member of the library's first Friends group and also a generous contributor.</p>
<p><b>Library expands in 2005</b></p> 
<p>In 2005 the library completed a $600,000 expansion, entirely paid for with 
grants and individual donations saved over many years. Not a penny of increased 
local tax dollars went toward the new building, one of only a few libraries in 
Colorado to accomplish such a feat.</p> 
<p>Now the library is asking voters for a 1.5 mill tax increase in November 
&#151; the first tax increase in 21 years - to maximize the benefits of the new 
facility and to expand services county citizens have asked for.</p> 
<p>&quot;All our books, programs and other materials are available free of 
charge to anyone with a library card,&quot; said acting library director Jackie 
Welch. &quot;And don't forget that a library card is free as well!&quot;</p> 
<p>Welch said that virtually everyone knows books are available at a library - 
in print as hard-cover or soft, as audio books on tape or CDs, or in large-type 
editions. Less well known, she pointed out, is the fact that about 70 different 
magazines are available for borrowing, as are videos, DVD movies, music CDs and 
interlibrary loans.</p> 
<p>There also are services for people with special needs, such as a machine 
that enlarges print material for those with eyesight problems and access to 
special books on tape for the disabled.</p> 
<p>As well, the library's computers are extremely popular, especially because 
they offer state-of-the-art computer services with filtering to ensure safe 
Internet access.</p> 
<p><b>Programs for all ages</b></p> 
<p>In addition to providing books, computers, other materials and services, 
the library hosts a variety of programs for all ages.</p> 
<p>Among the many programs for children are the Preschool Story Hour on 
Wednesday mornings, the Saturday morning Pagosa Pretender events, and the 
Summer Reading Program.</p> 
<p>Created especially for adults and seniors is the Lifelong Learning program, 
with a wide variety of events including a jazz concert, guest lecturers and 
slide shows. Lecture topics include local history, water issues, engineering, 
physics and the arts.</p> 
<p>Among programs for all ages are the annual Friends of the Library book sale 
and Pagosa Reads, a series of books reviews, lectures, slide shows and other 
events.</p> 
<p>Other ongoing programs include conversational French Thursday evenings and 
the library's new chess club on Tuesday evenings.</p> 
<p><b>Wealth of education, entertainment</b></p> 
<p>&quot;We hope everyone reading this article who hasn't come by the library 
lately will take the opportunity to visit us to see what we have available for 
you,&quot; Welch said.</p> 
<p>&quot;Our goal is to have all Archuleta County citizens consider the 
library a valuable resource for themselves and their families. We want everyone 
to be aware of the many free benefits of being a library card-holder, because 
we offer a wealth of education and entertainment at your convenience.&quot;</p> 
<p>&quot;Our democracy depends upon a citizenry that is well informed,&quot; 
Bright added, &quot;and our library's main mission is to provide materials to 
help accomplish that goal.&quot;</p> 
<p>She cited a quote from planetary scientist Carl Sagan, who said in his book 
&quot;Cosmos:&quot; &quot;I think the health of our civilization, the depth of 
our awareness about the underpinnings of our culture and our concern for the 
future can all be tested by how well we support our libraries.&quot;</p>

<p><b>'Music in the Celtic Tradition' at ECA Saturday concert </b></p> 
<p><b>By Paul Roberts</b></p> 
<p><b>Special to The PREVIEW</b></p> 
<p>Elation Center for the Arts presents &quot;Music in the Celtic 
Tradition,&quot; featuring Celtic harpist Sylvia Zurko, John Graves, Paul and 
Carla Roberts, Bob Nordmann, Harvey Schwartz and other performers at 7 p.m. 
Saturday, Oct. 21, at the Pagosa Lakes Clubhouse.</p> 
<p>A master's degree in music education and several years of teaching 
experience have provided Zurko with a solid base from which to pursue what has 
become her first love - performing and composing on her Celtic (folk) harp.</p> 
<p>She has worked to further the appreciation for folk music and dance in 
Durango, organizing concerts, festivals and dance groups since 1988. Believing 
in the healing power of music, especially harp music, Sylvia volunteered for 
several years in her local hospital, playing regularly for both patients and 
staff. Last year she traveled to France where she gave a concert in a 12th 
century church.</p> 
<p>According to Zurko, the Celts originated somewhere in the Middle East and 
migrated across Europe to the British Isles. In addition to Ireland, Scotland 
and Wales, their influence on music and culture still remains very strong in 
other regions such as Brittany in France, and Galicia in Spain. Her performance 
features music from all of these regions, with a brief musical journey going 
back in time to medieval France with her small lap harp, (a result of her 
wonderful trip and experiences there two summers ago).</p> 
<p>The Celtic folk harp that Zurko specializes in has origins reaching back to 
the first millennium. The Gaelic harps called &quot;clarsach&quot; in Scotland 
or &quot;clairseach&quot; in Ireland were perhaps the most popular musical 
instruments during medieval times. There is stone carving evidence showing that 
the harp was present in Gaelic/Pictish Scotland well before the 9th century, 
and early instruments were strung with horsehair, gut, and in the case of the 
harp played by the Gaels of Scotland and Ireland between the 11th and 19th 
centuries, wire strings. The wire-strung harp was played with the fingernails, 
and it produced a brilliant ringing sound. Especially popular in 16th and 17th 
century English courts, it was played all over Europe and was usually called 
the &quot;Irish Harp.&quot;</p> 
<p>After a lull when harps fell out of use in Scotland and Ireland, a revival 
of Celtic culture brought the harp back into use. Since the 1970s, musicians, 
harp makers and scholars have kept alive the ancient art of the Celtic harp by 
spreading its beautiful music the across the globe.</p> 
<p>Bob Nordmann takes the saxophone back in time to its reeded predecessors, 
with several period pieces. He will accompanied by pianist Harvey Schwartz for 
&quot;Molly on the Shore,&quot; a lively Irish folk song. Nordmann also 
performs with the Roberts on several tunes. Nordmann, who has been very well 
received at several past ECA concerts, says, &quot;I want to present the 
saxophone in a different light than most people get to hear it in.&quot;</p> 
<p>Carla and Paul Roberts will perform Celtic tunes on the &quot;Cittern&quot; 
or renaissance mandolin, wooden flutes and the Irish drum called the 
&quot;bodhran.&quot;</p> 
<p>John Graves will show how easily a beloved Irish melody adapts itself to 
modern harmonies and different interpretations, with his entertaining musical 
style and zany professorial persona.</p> 
<p>Dancers - imported from antiquity - can also be expected to grace the 
stage, when the Celtic meets the Southwest, for a concert of &quot;Music in the 
Celtic Tradition.&quot;</p> 
<p>Advance tickets, for $10, are available through elationarts.org and at 
WolfTracks Coffee House. Tickets at the door are $15 for adults and $5 for 
young people, 18 and under.</p> 
<p>Desserts and coffee will be provided at intermission. Please bring a 
dessert to share if you wish. </p> 
<p>Pagosa Lakes Clubhouse is located at 230 Port Ave., in the Vista 
subdivision of Pagosa Lakes. Take U.S. 160 to Vista, turn north on Vista and 
left on Port.</p> 
<p>Elation Center for the Arts serves the people of the southwest region of 
the USA and beyond by cultivating an appreciation for the arts. ECA offers life 
enrichment programs focused on preserving our cultural heritage. These programs 
include community concerts; music assemblies and performance residencies for 
schools; performance opportunities for accomplished and aspiring artists; and 
classes in the arts for students of all ages and backgrounds. Proceeds from 
this concert will help support these programs.</p>

<p><b>'Art: 21' makes contemporary art accessible </b></p> 
<p><b>By Leanne Goebel</b></p> 
<p><b>Special to The PREVIEW</b></p> 
<p>The PBS series &quot;Art: 21&quot; explores themes in contemporary art 
using living, working artists and their creations to challenge the viewer's 
concepts of place, spirituality, identity and consumption.</p> 
<p>On Thursday, Oct. 12, Shy Rabbit Contemporary Arts showed two sections from 
the first season: &quot;Place&quot; and &quot;Identity.&quot; Each hour-long 
section delved into the studios and work of some of the best-known contemporary 
artists working today, as well as emerging young artists.</p> 
<p>The theme of Place is explored through the work of Richard Serra whose 
gigantic steel sculptures invite viewers into spaces, to walk in them, around 
them, under them. Serra begins each sculpture with a model, bent aluminum 
semi-circles, stretching, reaching and twisting. The documentary follows Serra, 
as he and a team of engineers oversee the installation of &quot;Charlie 
Brown&quot; in the atrium of a building in San Francisco. The 60-foot tall 
steel sculpture with it's flowing waves of steel forming a square in the center 
expresses his acuity for containing space, holding space and giving context to 
space.</p> 
<p>Serra is constantly drawing in a sketchbook and tells how he used to draw 
for his parents. His father would take apart the car and Serra would draw the 
parts. Serra explained that the eye is a muscle and the more you draw the 
stronger the muscle becomes and the better you see.</p> 
<p>Another artists who expresses place is Sally Mann, a contemporary 
photographer working with traditional mediums. Mann photographs her children 
and the landscape of her beloved South - in Virginia, in their cabin without 
telephone or television. &quot;If it doesn't have ambiguity, don't bother 
taking it,&quot; Mann says. </p> 
<p>Place is also explored through the work of Mary Kilgallen and Barry McGee, 
young artists who use graffiti and hand painted imagery of the streets in their 
work. Their highly graphic work is often painted direct on gallery walls for 
installations. The documentary follows them between gallery installations and 
painting graffiti on trains.</p> 
<p>&quot;The gallery art crowd is the same people,&quot; McGee says. 
&quot;Outdoors its open to anyone to look at.&quot;</p> 
<p>And finally, artist Pepon Osorio says: &quot;I need to create a space 
that's overpowering. A place where you need to reflect and confront yourself: 
Who are you in relation to what you have just seen?&quot;</p> 
<p>Osorio's installations explore Hispanic culture and the artist says that he 
is always doing things subversive and contradictory. He takes his art on home 
visits, where an artwork stays in someone's home for several weeks and they get 
to live with it. Through that act, Osorio says that his displacement in the art 
world seems perfectly fine.</p> 
<p>The theme of Identity is explored through the work of Bruce Nauman, who 
came to the realization that whatever he was doing in the studio must be art. 
Filmed at the artist's New Mexico studio and ranch, Nauman paints, sculpts, 
makes prints and does film and installation art. He comments while watching a 
videotape of mice in his studio: &quot;You have to kind of not watch anything, 
so you can be aware of everything.&quot;</p> 
<p>Identity is also featured in the work of Kerry James Marshall, an 
African-American painter who says he wants to &quot;reclaim the image of 
blackness as an image of power.&quot; Marshall paints figures with emphatically 
black skin tones. But he also culls from the societal influences of his 
upbringing to create comic strips featuring powerful African-American figures.
</p> 
<p>For Maya Lin, art is &quot;everything you have every known and everything 
you've ever done, somehow percolating up with ideas you might want to 
explore.&quot; Best known as the designer of the Vietnam Memorial, Lin is 
trained as an artist and architect and designs public spaces, parks and 
monuments that make a place for individuals within the landscape. Hired to 
create a sculpture for a park in Grand Rapids, Mich., the artist felt that a 
single work would not have as much impact as a complete redesign of the space 
that now includes a skating rink, embedded with lights mirroring the stars in 
the sky.</p> 
<p>Summing up the theme of identity is Louise Bourgeois who says: &quot;I am 
not what I am. I am what I do with my hands.&quot;</p> 
<p>&quot;Art: 21&quot; is the first PBS series to explore contemporary art. 
The series ran for three seasons on PBS and Shy Rabbit Contemporary Arts will 
show the remaining themes from season one: Spirituality and Consumption on 
Thursday, Dec. 14, at 6:30 p.m. as part of their &quot;Let's Explore&quot; 
series.</p> 
<p>&quot;Let's Explore&quot; will feature Gerry Riggs, juror for the current 
&quot;Form, Figures, Symbols&quot; exhibition at Shy Rabbit Contemporary Arts. 
Riggs will share slides and work from some of his favorite contemporary artists 
on Thursday, Nov. 9 at 6:30 p.m. Riggs curated more than 400 exhibits during

<p><b>Lifelong learning considers ice sheets, glaciers, sea levels </b></p> 
<p><b>By Biz Greene</b></p> 
<p><b>Special to The PREVIEW</b></p> 
<p>The next Lifelong Learning lecture is &quot;Glaciers, ice sheets, and 
sea-level rise: What's Happening Now?,&quot; presented by Dr. Charles Burnham.
</p> 
<p>About 80 percent of the world's fresh water is contained in the earth's 
cryosphere, namely its glaciers and ice sheets. The cryosphere is made up of 
many tens of thousands of glaciers found in mountainous regions worldwide, a 
number of relatively small ice caps in arctic and alpine regions, and, of 
paramount importance, the immense ice sheets of Greenland and Antarctica.</p> 
<p>For at least the past century most of the alpine glaciers and small ice 
caps worldwide have been receding, and thus could be characterized as being in 
&quot;ill health.&quot; It appears quite possible that many of them may 
disappear completely over the next century.</p> 
<p>As climate changes occur, the massive Greenland and Antarctica ice sheets, 
that now make up about 9 and 85 percent of the earth's cryosphere respectively, 
could potentially cause devastating rises in sea-level from their melting; that 
would significantly impact a large percentage of the world's human population.
</p> 
<p>Historically, it has been extremely difficult to assess the current net 
mass balance of these ice sheets, and hence knowledge about their contributions 
to rising sea level has been obscure. Over the past several years, however, new 
techniques have been brought to bear on this problem.</p> 
<p>Burnham will present an up-to-date assessment of the current state of these 
huge ice masses, how they may behave in the near future, and what the 
implications of various possible scenarios are with respect to sea-level 
changes.</p> 
<p>This free lecture is at 3 p.m. Oct. 21 at the Sisson Library. All are 
welcome.</p>

<p><b>'Forms, Figures, Symbols' opens Saturday at Shy Rabbit </b></p> 
<p><b>By Leanne Goebel</b></p> 
<p><b>Special to The PREVIEW</b></p> 
<p>&quot;Forms, Figures, Symbols&quot; opens Saturday at Shy Rabbit 
Contemporary Arts featuring 59 works of contemporary art by 43 artists from 
around the country.</p> 
<p>Following Saturday'a artists' reception, the show will be on display 
through Nov. 28.</p> 
<p>Juror Gerry Riggs, former director of the Gallery of Contemporary Art at CU 
Colorado Springs, selected works for the exhibition.</p> 
<p>Opening reception with the artists is Saturday, Oct. 21, from 5-8 p.m. </p> 
<p>&quot;I was delighted that there were so many submissions to choose 
from,&quot; Riggs said. &quot;I thought the intake would be mostly from 
regional artists but, as it happens, there were entries from all over the 
country. This means that the show has a national scope, which is more than I 
had hoped for.&quot;</p> 
<p>A total of 182 submissions were received from 61 artists working throughout 
the country, in various mediums.</p> 
<p>Artists selected for &quot;Forms, Figures, Symbols&quot; include: Maude 
Andrade, N.M.; Kelly Angard, Colo.; Sandy Applegate, Colo.; W. Howard 
Brandenburg, N.M.; Sandra Butler, Colo.; Tirzah Camacho, Colo.; Lou Chapman, 
Texas; Sarah Comerford, Colo.; Deborah DeGraffenreid, N.Y.; Leah Dunaway, 
Texas; Lal B. Echterhoff, Colo.; Aaron Englert, Colo.; Ted Fish, Colo.; Ronald 
Gonzalez, N.Y.; Jean Gumpper, Colo.; C.J. Hannah, Colo.; Crystal Hartman, 
Colo.; Barbara Heinrich, Colo.; Diana Jacobs, Calif.; Gail Lois Jaffe, 
Florida.; Bradley Kachnowicz, Colo.; Rebecca Koeppen, Colo.; Shama Ko, Texas.; 
Marcie Lenke, Mass.; Patrick Linehan, Illinois; Don R. Long, Colo.; Mary Ellen 
Long, Colo.; Lara Loutrel, Mass.; Raymond Martinez, Colo; Marie McCallum, 
Colo.; Sid McCammond, Colo.; Daisy McConnell, Colo.; Lynne Medsker, Indiana; 
Paul F. Morris, Colo.; Maryellen Morrow, Colo.; Al Olson, Colo.; Linda 
Pampinella, Colo.; Joan Levine-Russell, Colo.; William Secrest, Colo.; Harold 
D. Seibel, Colo.; Marcy Sperry, Illinois; Don Weir, Colo.; Amy K. Wendland, 
Colo.</p> 
<p>&quot;I ended up selecting about a third of the submissions,&quot; Riggs 
added. &quot;There is a limit as to what can be reasonably exhibited on Shy 
Rabbit's walls and I'm certain I pushed the number of selections right up to 
that limit. I recommended that particular related works be hung stacked in 
order to accommodate more work than is usually shown.&quot;</p> 
<p>The work selected is diverse.</p> 
<p>Riggs seemed surprised that &quot;there was not an abundance of 
three-dimensional submissions, but I was particularly pleased with the 3-D 
selections as they were generally quite contemporary in treatment and varied in 
their themes, choice of materials and execution.&quot;</p> 
<p>Yet, for a show entitled, &quot;Forms, Figures, Symbols,&quot; there were 
not as many figurative submissions as Riggs expected. Many of the figurative 
submissions didn't make it into the show, he said. &quot;Not because they 
weren't well executed, but because they were simply very traditional or 
academic in treatment. This is a contemporary show and that translates into 
original, unique or fresh approaches to the subject.&quot;</p> 
<p>Riggs is pleased with the work and his selections. </p> 
<p>&quot;Overall, I think the show is comparable to many good contemporary 
exhibitions I have seen or curated in the past, and will prove to be a 
worthwhile, varied and interesting exhibition for viewers,&quot; he said, then 
added: &quot;I'm sure it will also give some viewers something to consider, 
apart from the usual. I am grateful to Shy Rabbit for allowing me to select the 
show, as I'm sure they knew that my artistic leanings are far from timid or 
conventional.&quot;</p> 
<p>Riggs spent more than 14 years at CU Colorado Springs as the gallery 
director and an assistant professor. Prior to that, he was a curator of fine 
art and an exhibition coordinator at the Colorado Springs Fine Art Center. 
Earlier in his career he served as the curator for the C.B. Goddard Center for 
Visual and Performing Arts in Ardmore, Okla.</p> 
<p>Riggs' professional accomplishments include the installation design for 
over 400 exhibitions. He is credited for transforming the gallery at the 
University of Colorado at Colorado Springs into one of the region's most 
important art spaces, and the only one dedicated to contemporary art, whether 
regional of from halfway around the world. He is a member of the American 
Association of Museums, and the AAM Museum Advocacy Team. Riggs became a 
full-time resident of Pagosa Springs in 2006. He is an accomplished 
photographer, session drummer and avid skier.</p>

<p>&quot;I hope local art lovers, or even just curiosity seekers, will attend 
this slide presentation,&quot; Riggs said. &quot;I intend to show contemporary 
artists' works that I have curated and/or exhibited over the course of my art 
career. This art is both challenging and intentionally provocative, and I hope 
to explain why I particularly like it, even though I know many will not. I find 
that over time this caliber of art will remain imprinted on the uninitiated, 
even though it may initially puzzle or even intimidate those who are used to 
tamer, more traditional work ... or even the generally sanitized fare too often 
seen in lesser art entities than the paradoxically named Shy Rabbit.&quot;</p>

<p><b>Sneetches and Greek theater at Sunday UU service </b></p> 
<p>On Sunday, Oct. 22, the Rev. Joan Becelaere, visiting from Denver, will 
present a sermon for the Pagosah Unitarian Universalist Fellowship entitled 
&quot;The Sneetches vs. the Deus Ex Machina.&quot;</p> 
<p>She explains, &quot;'The Sneetches' is a wonderful story by Dr. Seuss which 
has several layers of meaning. Deus Ex Machina is Latin for 'god from the 
machine,' a kind of ancient theatrical device for saving the day at the last 
minute.&quot; Then the question, &quot;What do Dr. Seuss and Greek theatrical 
devices have to say to us about risk and change and our lives?&quot;</p> 
<p>Van Becelaere is a Unitarian Universalist community minister and vice 
president for student services at the Iliff School of Theology in Denver. She 
has a background in public policy analysis and children's theater. And her 
favorite theologian is Dr. Seuss.</p> 
<p>The service and child care begin at 10:30 a.m. in the Pagosah Unitarian 
Universalist Fellowship Hall, Unit 15, Greenbriar Plaza. Turn east on

<p>Local employers are struggling to find qualified employees. </p> 
<p>The Pagosa Springs Workforce Center, along with Workforce Centers around 
the state, has responded by incorporating online employability testing that can 
be tailored to meet an employer's needs. Job seekers also benefit because the 
tests are not academic, but test employment skills and can help them market 
their skills.</p> 
<p>There are two testing programs - WorkKeys and Qwiz and 1 program, KeyTrain 
- that can help an employee build his or her skills in every area WorkKeys 
tests. Nationally-recognized companies provide WorkKeys (ACT) and Qwiz 
(Previsor). WorkKeys tests nine areas of employability from Applied Math to 
Teamwork; Qwiz has over 350 tests ranging from accounting skills and customer 
service to specific computer programs.</p> 
<p>The Pagosa Springs Workforce Center will help an employer select the tests, 
which best represent the skills needed for the specific job description. Staff 
will also help job seekers identify the best tests for marketing their skills 
to employers. The Pagosa Springs Workforce Center is working on educating 
employers about the new value-added services to help them find qualified 
employees.</p>

<p><b>PREVIEW Columnist</b></p> 
<p>U.S. Sen. Ken Salazar appeared at the community center Monday to talk about 
the proposed Village at Wolf Creek development.</p> 
<p>He explained that he was in the process of gathering information from both 
sides of the Continental Divide, the east and west slopes. He will listen to 
both sides in the debate.</p> 
<p>After some introductory remarks, the Senator took questions from the 
audience, which numbered about 150 people. Questioners expressed concerns about 
the energy demands of a large development, water supply, the problems of 
dealing with waste water, the safety problems caused by increased car and truck 
traffic, etc. Several people were concerned that an environmental impact study 
has been done only on the access roads, not on the village development as a 
whole.</p>

wonderful Italian wedding soup with meatballs.</p> 
<p>Edith has visited Italy and even taken cooking classes there, and she has a 
thorough knowledge of Italian ingredients and cooking techniques. On Oct 25 ,at 
10 a.m., the next class will offer tips on how to make pasta from scratch. This 
is a grand opportunity to expand your cooking horizons and have fun at the same 
time.</p> 
<p>There are still a few places left in the Oct. 25 class; the fee is $10, 
which covers the cost of ingredients and supplies and must be paid ahead of 
class time. Please remember that no reservations will be taken without the 
prepayment. And also note that class fees are not refundable, but they are 
transferable. If you find that you are unable to attend, you can give away or 
sell your space to a friend.</p> 
<p><b>Managing Diabetes</b></p> 
<p>The next meeting is today at 5:30 p.m. when members of the Managing 
Diabetes group will discuss complications of the disease and how to cope with 
them. If you have recently been diagnosed, please consider coming to this 
meeting. Each person in the group has experienced what you are now going 
through. There is helpful information here, and encouraging words can lighten 
the grim prospect of huge changes in your lifestyle.</p> 
<p>Finding out that you have diabetes is scary, but people with diabetes can 
live long, healthy, happy lives. While diabetes occurs in people of all ages 
and races, some groups have a higher risk for developing type 2 diabetes than 
others. Type 2 diabetes is more common in African Americans, Latinos, Native 
Americans, and Asian Americans/Pacific Islanders, as well as the aged 
population.</p> 
<p>This group is for diagnosed diabetics, those at risk for diabetes, and also 
for those who care for or live with diabetics. Call the center at 264-4152 to 
let us know what this group can do for you.</p> 
<p><b>Yoga class</b></p> 
<p>We urge you to visit Diana Baird's class at 10:30 a.m. Tuesday mornings. 
The class lasts for an hour. Attending will allow you to gain flexibility, 
stamina, strength and to reduce stress. While yoga is mainly about static 
positions and stretching, the appeal of yoga lies partly in its celebrity 
endorsement, but also because it gives participants a chance to relax and 
offers a vital release from the rising stress levels many experience.</p> 
<p>Diana's yoga class has been well attended, but there is room for you to 
join in. Come and experience the gentle stretching and relaxation of a yoga 
session. Call the Center at 264-4152 for more information.</p> 
<p><b>Line dancing</b></p> 
<p>The beginning dance group meets at 9 a.m. before line dancing; this is a 
very basic class. The object here is to encourage men just to get up and go 
around the dance floor using some very simple steps of the two-step and waltz. 
No skill is necessary; the men simply have to be able to walk. It makes their 
wives happy! Call Gerry Potticary for a free private introduction if interested.
</p> 
<p>Line dancing rocks on at 10 for beginners; at 10:30 there is dancing for 
those who are more advanced. Learn the Electric Slide; New York, New York; Old 
Bones; and last but not least, Trashy Woman and Trippin'. Call the center at 
264-4152 for more information.</p> 
<p><b>Canceled dates</b></p> 
<p>Karla Dominguez reports that the baton twirling classes are going well, but 
that there is room for more students. The lessons are on Mondays and start at 
3:30 p.m.; they last for an hour. All ages are welcome - kindergarten and up. 
Karla says that the first lesson will be free, and successive ones will be $3 
per session. A discounted monthly rate is also available. Bring your own 
balanced baton or purchase one at the class, where new ones are for sale at $18 
each. If you would like to sign up and order a baton, call Karla at 731-5365. 
Or, you can sign up at the community center by calling 264-4152.</p> 
<p>There will be no class Oct. 23 because school is closed that day, nor on 
Oct. 30 when the gym will be decorated for the Halloween party. The next class 
will be Nov. 6.</p> 
<p><b>eBay Club</b></p> 
<p>The eBay Club has decided to meet twice a month instead of once. </p> 
<p>Meeting dates will be on the first and third Wednesday of each month from 
5:30-7:30 p.m. in the computer lab. The next class is Oct 18.</p> 
<p>Ben Bailey, who began this class, says that each session seems to draw a 
few newcomers. With that in mind, he offers an introductory training session, 
which is followed by problem solving and a time for sharing eBay experiences.
</p> 
<p>Join Bailey for tips and advice on buying and selling. Call him at 264-0293 
or the center at 264-4152 for more information.</p>

<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p> <b>Veteran's Corner</b> 
<p></p> 
<p><b>Choices in VA Health Care </b></p> 
<p><b>By Andy Fautheree</b></p> 
<p>For many veterans, VA Health Care is the number-one benefit that is most 
often asked about, applied for, or cussed and discussed.</p> 
<p>Cussed and discussed if you didn't happen to apply before Jan. 16, 2003; 
praised if you just had a colonoscopy for $50 copay at the VAMC in Albuquerque; 
or back to cussed and discussed for the mountains of paperwork sometimes 
involved.</p> 
<p><b>Eligibility</b></p> 
<p>If you enrolled in VA Health Care before Jan. 16, 2003, you are 
grandfathered in the system. You get VAHC regardless of current income.</p> 
<p>Enrollment eligibility is based on income if you enrolled after Jan. 16, 
2003, and do not have any special considerations.</p> 
<p>If you have VA-rated service-connected disabilities, a Purple Heart, POW 
status or fit in a few other special categories, you can receive free health 
care services for those associated conditions.</p> 
<p>If your current income is above a certain threshold, at worst you have to 
pay copays for doctor visits, specialist care, prescription drugs and inpatient 
care. If your income is below a certain level you may get part or all of these 
services for free.</p> 
<p>If you are currently enrolled in VAHC one of the &quot;cussed&quot; issues 
is an annual financial Means Test to determine copay status. This is always 
based on the previous calendar year. The VA sometimes matches the income you 
report with the IRS and what you report to the VA, and the two better match up 
or you get nasty letters from the VA demanding your declare the correct income, 
etc.</p> 
<p><b>Means Test</b></p> 
<p>The test is very intimidating to many, especially our older veterans. The 
VA sends out a two-page Means Test blank form called the 1010EZR for the 
veteran to completely fill out. Why they do this when they have the veteran's 
entire information in a data base continues to dumbfound me.</p> 
<p>At the top of the 1010EZR form is the statement: &quot;Federal law provides 
criminal penalties, including a fine and/or imprisonment for up to 5 years, for 
concealing a material fact or making a materially false statement.&quot;</p> 
<p>Now, if that isn't intimidating to an 85-year-old WWII veteran, I don't 
know what is!</p> 
<p><b>Use technology</b></p> 
<p>It seems to me it would require low-level technology for the VA to pre-fill 
out the 1010EZR form for the veteran and ask them to update any information 
that is not current, thereby saving the veteran the task of filling in his name 
(two places), Social Security number (two places), address, phone numbers, next 
of kin, etc., and repeat this every year.</p> 
<p>Frequently, if the veteran is over 65, their income doesn't change from 
year to year. Yet the VA still insists they fill it out.</p> 
<p><b>Cussed again</b></p> 
<p>Other &quot;cussed&quot; issues include that usually nothing will change in 
the veteran's VAHC enrollment priority status because of the information on the 
Means Test. Most likely the veteran is paying copays and will continue to pay 
copays.</p> 
<p>However, if the veterans enrolled before Jan. 16, 2003, they can choose not 
to provide the financial Means Test every year, and agree to pay the copays, 
which again they are probably paying anyway.</p> 
<p><b>Fuel money</b></p> 
<p>Don't forget to stop by my office for reimbursement of your fuel and 
overnight accommodation receipts to VA health care appointments. We are 
currently reimbursing 100 percent of your VA Health Care travel expenses. Also, 
help a fellow veteran who may be going in the same direction to the same VA 
facility and give me a call if you can provide transportation or need 
transportation. I will keep a calendar of who is going where to coordinate this 
important program.</p>

<p><b>Civic Club Christmas bazaar, record number of booths, raffle, great food 
</b></p> 
<p><b>By Carole Howard</b></p> 
<p><b>PREVIEW Columnist, and the library staff</b></p> 
<p>Christmas must be approaching quickly, because the Woman's Civic Club will 
host their annual Christmas bazaar in only a little more than two weeks - on 
Saturday, Nov. 4, from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. at the community center.</p> 
<p>This very fun event marks the beginning of the holiday season for many 
locals, and this year's bazaar will set records for the number and variety of 
vendors ready to meet your shopping needs.</p> 
<p>In fact, there will be 63 booths - 13 more than last year - featuring 
myriad vendors including jewelers, weavers, pottery, woodwork, photography, 
frames, tole paintings, embroidery, Christmas items, fall decorations, 
knitting, paintings and leatherwork.</p> 
<p>The Civic Club ladies will have their incredible baked goods booth so you 
can purchase goodies to eat now or put in the freezer for holiday entertaining. 
They'll also have lots of good food, including coffee for early shoppers and 
their famous beef brisket on a bun for lunch if you want to take a pleasant 
break from your shopping.</p> 
<p>Plus there are about 30 wonderful raffle items - including three wreaths 
and a basket, each containing $50 in either one or five-dollar bills - to tempt 
you. Tickets are $1 each or 6 for $5, available at the library.</p> 
<p>The bazaar is the Civic Club's largest fundraiser of the year for the 
library. So we hope you'll come, enjoy yourself, do some holiday shopping and 
support a great cause - your library.</p>

Afghanistan&quot; tells the inspiring story of two extraordinary women - Dayna 
Curry and Heather Mercer - who were arrested by the Taliban for teaching 
Christianity and then rescued by U.S. Special Forces. Legal scholar Mark 
Tushnet has written &quot;A Court Divided: The Rehnquist Court and the Future 
of Constitutional Law&quot; about the views of individual justices on the

all time - the tale of Mary Magdalene hiding a set of scrolls that were her 
version of the events and characters in the New Testament. &quot;Revelation 
Unveiled,&quot; by Tim Lahaye reveals the Biblical foundation for the 
best-selling &quot;Left Behind&quot; series of novels and helps you better

<p><b>PSAC Gallery features first juried photo show </b></p> 
<p><b>By Linda Strathdee</b></p> 
<p><b>PREVIEW Columnist</b></p> 
<p>PSAC's first Juried Photography Exhibit opened last Thursday evening to a 
large and appreciative crowd.</p> 
<p>Those in attendance enjoyed not only outstanding photography but soft 
background music from classical guitarist Stephanie Bouchier as well. 
Award-winning photographer Howard Rachlin, joined Dean Conger, a longtime staff 
photographer at National Geographic magazine and widely-acclaimed local 
photojournalist, Wen Saunders as judges for this first-ever show.</p> 
<p>Saunders presented the following cash prizes: first-place Professional, 
David Reineke; first-place Amateur, Robert Ratcliff; honorable mentions went to 
Bruce Andersen, Barbara Conkey and Margaret Reeves.</p> 
<p>Rachlin's specialty is photography in the Southwest and, in particular in 
the Four Corners area. He uses unusual techniques when possible to create more 
memorable photographs. Howard's award-winning photographs hang in homes and 
offices across the country and have been published numerous times in Durango 
Magazine, and the Durango Herald. He has several photographs in the 2006 Animas 
Conservancy calendar, has exhibited in many galleries and shows in the Four 
Corners area and is currently at the Habitat for Humanity Gallery.</p> 
<p>Howard has joined the &quot;digital revolution.&quot; His main cameras are 
a Minolta A2, 8 megapixel advanced digital camera and a Sony A100 digital SLR 
(10 megapixel). He prints his photographs using an Ultrachrome process on 
archival paper with an expected life of up to 75 years. This way he has total 
creative control over the quality of the print which also exhibits superior 
resistance to water, fading and smudging. Howard shares his knowledge and 
experience with members of the Durango Photography Club which he formed in 
February 2003.</p> 
<p>Conger and his wife, Lee, are now retired and live in Durango. He was one 
of a few photographers granted broad access to the former Soviet Union in the 
1960s; his pictures for National Geographic were also made into a book. His 
photograph of a small girl waving became one of the most popular pictures ever 
published in the Geographic. When he joined the Geographic staff, he was named 
Magazine Photographer of the Year. While working at the Denver Post, Conger was 
a three-time national Newspaper Photographer of the year.</p> 
<p>In 1998 Conger produced a major multi-image show on Mussorgsky's 
&quot;Pictures at an Exhibition.&quot; Five hundred photographs from 25 years 
of travel in Russia were edited to fit the themes of Mussorgsky's music. Seven 
projectors were synched live to his music on a 10' x 30' screen suspended over 
the Music in the Mountains Orchestra, playing in Durango's new concert hall at 
Fort Lewis College. Reviewers called it &quot;awesome, stunning, beautiful, and 
even breathtaking.&quot;</p> 
<p>Saunders resides in Pagosa Springs and Lafayette, (just outside of 
Boulder). Saunders is a photojournalist, known for documenting life events. Her 
images have appeared in publications and Web sites throughout the country. 
American Cowboy Magazine recognized Saunders with a story about her rodeo 
photojournalism images. The article talked of the authenticity of black and 
white photography as western art. Saunders's images go beyond the 
&quot;ride&quot; of rodeo, as she photographs moments before and after the 
ride. When Saunders photographs, it is a juggling of cameras and lenses, within 
seconds, to capture a moment. Saunders, who is petite in size, has been known 
to carry her weight in gear. Her western and rodeo fine art photographs have 
exhibited in fine art shows throughout the country including Sedona Fine Art 
Festival, The Pagosa Springs Arts Council Art Exhibit, Open Shutter Gallery, 
and Cowboy Christmas (during National Rodeo Finals - Las Vegas). A permanent 
collection of her rodeo images is displayed at Caf&eacute; Blue Restaurant in 
Boulder. .</p> 
<p>In addition, Saunders has spoken at numerous state and national conventions 
for professional photographers. Saunders is known for her in-depth and vibrant 
seminar presentations, supported by the photographic industry, including Fuji, 
Kodak, Canon, Hasselblad, and Tamron for numerous years. Saunders conducts 
PhotoLEARN camps for aspiring adult and kid photographers throughout the 
country (see www.wendysaunders.com) providing participants a unique opportunity 
to study with a working photojournalist. Saunders has taught photography and 
graphic design classes at Jacksonville University (Jacksonville, Fla.), Florida 
Community College, and John Tyler Community College (Chester, Va.). Saunders 
holds a B.F.A. in communication arts and design from Virginia Commonwealth 
University.</p> 
<p>The exhibit in the Town Park gallery, 315 Hermosa Street, continues through 
Oct. 31. All works from these featured photographers are for sale.</p> 
<p><b>One-day Davis workshop</b></p> 
<p>Local artist Randall Davis will hold a one-day drawing workshop 9 a.m.-3 
p.m. Saturday, Nov. 4, at the community center.</p> 
<p>The workshop will include a review of basic drawing techniques; students

classes, it's a treat to see what you can produce in a day under his guidance. 
</p> 
<p>Supplies needed for this class include sketch pad (preferably 11x14), 
assorted drawing pencils - including a 3H or 4H, a No. 2, and a 3B or 4B -

<p><b>Great Geezer Art</b></p> 
<p>&quot;Great Geezer Art: Creative Expression in Old Age, from Michelangelo 
to Matisse, Hokusai to Picasso&quot; is the title of a slide talk to be given

<p><b>Chardonnay? I like white Burgundy </b></p> 
<p><b>By James Robinson</b></p> 
<p><b>Staff Writer</b></p> 
<p>About two weeks ago, John Hundley asked if I liked chardonnay. </p> 
<p>I responded, &quot;I like white Burgundy.&quot;</p> 
<p>Laughing, he said, &quot;I knew I'd get an answer like that.&quot;</p> 
<p>I'm not sure what he meant by his response, so let me clarify my answer.</p>
<p>Chardonnay is a grape. Burgundy is a French winemaking region - a region 
that uses chardonnay, and small doses of aligot&eacute; for its whites, and 
pinot noir for its reds. Chardonnay is also used in Champagne and I enjoy the 
produce of both appellations.</p> 
<p>But when someone asks specifically if I like chardonnay, I naturally assume 
they are referring to wine produced in an area that identifies its juice 
primarily by grape variety and not by region. In the case of John's question, 
particularly his diction, I assumed he meant domestic or Australian chardonnay 
as opposed to the chardonnay-based whites of Burgundy and Champagne - we were 
in a meeting and I wasn't able to clarify - and hence, my answer.</p> 
<p>To clarify further, it's not that I dislike chardonnay, in what I assumed 
was John's sense of the term; it's that I don't like what winemakers, 
particularly North American and Australian winemakers, do to chardonnay.</p> 
<p>For years, the hallmarks of California chardonnay have been huge oak and 
loads of butter, with subtleties of terroir and fruit taking a back seat in the 
flavor profile. The wines were, and many remain, about power, to the extent 
that some taste forced, even doctored with synthetic flavorings and hints of 
vanilla extract.</p> 
<p>White Burgundy is worlds apart.</p> 
<p>If California chardonnay is a pole dancer at a grungy, downtown strip club, 
then white Burgundy is the object of your desire seen across the room, wearing 
heels, a black cocktail dress and a simple strand of pearls. The differences 
between the two are obvious and profound.</p> 
<p>California chardonnay, and Australian chardonnay for that matter, can be a 
full frontal sensory assault, where the wines are crafted to browbeat the 
drinker into oaky-buttery submission - a trend that produced the familiar 
mantra &quot;ABC: Anything But Chardonnay.&quot; White Burgundy, on the other 
hand, is about poise, elegance, subtlety and grace. White burgundy is about the 
allure and subtlety of terroir, the complex interplay of fruit, acidity and 
minerals, and of oak used with carefully measured restraint. If California 
chardonnay bares all at the pop of the cork; white Burgundy is a slow 
seduction. I am generalizing. And there are exceptions on both sides of the 
Atlantic.</p> 
<p>The great wines of Corton-Charlemagne, Chassagne-Montrachet, 
Puligny-Montrachet, Chablis and Pouilly-Fuiss&eacute; can all be prone to 
delusions of oaky grandeur. For example, on a recent visit to my old digs in 
Albuquerque, a customer asked for an &quot;oaky, buttery chardonnay,&quot; and 
a former colleague found an over-oaked Pouilly-Fuiss&eacute; that knocked her 
socks off. In addition, I have tasted various vintages of Lavantureux Chablis, 
with their crunchy, toasted oak notes that were, and remain, some of my 
favorites among French whites.</p> 
<p>During the years when I consistently tasted equal quantities of Old and New 
World wine, I occasionally found that rare Californian chardonnay that struck 
me as oddly and pleasantly Burgundian - exhibiting equal measures of terroir, 
fruit, oak and butter - and those too, I found immensely enjoyable. 
Unfortunately years have passed, and vintages change, and I am, I'm sorry to 
admit, out of the New World wine loop, although I know those Burgundian-style 
gems still exist.</p> 
<p>So, John, do I like chardonnay?</p> 
<p>My answer still stands. I like white Burgundy, but I'm open to suggestions.

<p><b>Food for Thought</b> </p> 
<p><b>A new life for an old guy ... online </b></p> 
<p><b>By Karl Isberg</b></p> 
<p>I'm about to begin a sixth decade on this crusty and ever-weirder orb.</p> 
<p>I'm far past middle age and not thrilled about it (despite what the 
perversely optimistic among us say - you know, the goofs who spout crap like 
&quot;Fifty is the new thirty&quot; or &quot;The older I am, the better things 
get.&quot;</p> 
<p>And yet, I'm still suffering the proverbial middle-age crisis. </p> 
<p>This crisis has been dragging on for a long time now, and I need to end to 
it soon.</p> 
<p>Before I die.</p> 
<p>I need to find something new, careerwise, something exciting to do with my 
life - a pursuit that will allow me to make my mark. I need to achieve success 
in other areas in my life as well, in terms of money, health, relationships, 
self image.</p> 
<p>I am tabula rasa, as it were; clear as a bell, ready, willing and able. I 
have finally given up my dream of being a space shuttle pilot. Same with being 
a theoretical physicist. I am, at last, resigned to the fact I will not play on 
an NBA basketball team or win the Olympic high jump.</p> 
<p>In my dotage, I am a realist.</p> 
<p>Armed with a levelheaded perspective, I have been on the lookout for a door 
in the ever-shorter hallway of life, one that will open on new possibilities.
</p> 
<p>I responded to a couple of those tiny ads in Popular Mechanics for home 
study courses. I sat up late at night for weeks, poring over the material, but 
nothing worked out; I failed to absorb skills in duct installation or emissions 
control device repair. Try as I might.</p> 
<p>Then I began to read the many e-mails I receive at work (at my temporary 
place of employment, as a temporary newspaper editor). I get plenty of these 
hummers pushed through the digital tube by computerized hamsters, thousands a 
week, as a matter of fact. Previously, I casually deleted most of them (along 
with a large number of letters to the editor, obituaries, thank you notes from 
invalids and civic groups, and pleas for help in finding a lost spaniel or 
saving an endangered species).</p> 
<p>Once I began reading the Internet missives and evaluating the opportunities 
offered therein, I realized there is hope! There are folks out there who care 
about my physical, emotional and economic well being.</p> 
<p>What a swell, high-tech world this is.</p> 
<p>Here I am, an old guy, adrift, bobbing slowly toward the Big Shore in a 
litter-filled, flat surf and what do I spy just ahead on the virtual horizon? A 
life raft, a means to propel myself back to the glittering cruise ship of life 
- that sparkly haven where existence is a full-blown, 
wear-your-best-Hawaiian-shirt party, and everyone on board is a rousing, 
totally fulfilled success. Life there can be magnificent, in every possible 
respect; so wonderful, in fact, it slops ceaselessly over the rim of the 
existential mug.</p> 
<p>That vessel, that ark?</p> 
<p>The Internet.</p> 
<p>There's good stuff on the Net, for example the material from which a sturdy 
life foundation is constructed - vibrant and intimate relationships, financial 
gain, great health productive of frisky activity, sophisticated education and 
training.</p> 
<p>Just what I need!</p> 
<p>As I study the e-mails, it becomes apparent everyone who contacts me on the 
Internet is ultra generous, intensely concerned about the quality of my life.
</p> 
<p>They are, in effect, offering to paddle the life raft as I make my way to 
the cruise ship to join my fellow fully-realized passengers. (I have a hunch, 
once you are on board, you are immortal).</p> 
<p>And, the best part of most of these Internet opportunities is you don't 
have to do anything tedious or time-consuming to receive accolades, degrees, 
love, money, certificates of achievement, glory. If you've got some bucks, 
they're yours for the taking.</p> 
<p>As I read the titles of the e-mails, it is clear what benefits await me.</p>
<p>Personal relationships? What does &quot;Girls Don't Like U?&quot; have to 
say about the changes in lifestyle I'll undergo if I send a bit of cash to a 
Web site in return for &quot;instructions?&quot;</p> 
<p>&quot;Nobody Will No About Your Problims.&quot;</p> 
<p>Perfect. I have so many of problims, any tips on how to hide them is a 
godsend. Girls will like me, and they won't have a clue about my problims. It 
doesn't get much better than that!</p> 
<p>&quot;Viagggra, Perscripshun Medicss for Every Alement.&quot;</p> 
<p>By all means. (The &quot;viagggra&quot; might lead to an embarrassing 
moment in the produce section of the supermarket, but I'm pretty sure the blood 
pressure medication I receive from Mexico in &quot;an unmarked package&quot; 
will deal with the emergency.)</p> 
<p>Once I've made these simple social and pharmaceutical adjustments to my 
personal life, I will &quot;Look In the Mirrer, and enjoy the New U,&quot; 
compliments of a delivery including &quot;miracle trim tablets&quot; and 
&quot;electromagnetic devices to melt fat and erase wrinkles.&quot; For only 
$25.</p> 
<p>Wow. Couldn't be easier.</p> 
<p>On the upward mobility side, the employment spectrum glows with this 
incredible opportunity: &quot;Get the Rewards if a Colluge Degree: Join Success 
Univercity for Only $2.&quot;</p> 
<p>Two bucks &#138; for a bachelor's degree! Another ten smackers and I have 
my Ph.D. in Global Finance.</p> 
<p>From Success U.</p> 
<p>You can brag about your Harvard Business School education, if you like. You 
can spout off about Wharton, if you are insecure. Me, I will be a graduate of 
Success Univercity. Get outta my way!</p> 
<p>The moment I graduate with my doctorate from SU, I will discover 
&quot;Martin Has Just Added U as a Frend.&quot;</p> 
<p>Finally, &quot;a frend.&quot; A social life! I hope I can hold back the 
tears. It's Martin: who woulda thought it possible?</p> 
<p>With my new frend, unwrinkled good looks and prestige, I'll need a source 
of quick funds to support my high-roller lifestyle (after all, it'll take a few 
months for the cash to start rolling in from my career in Global Finance).</p> 
<p>&quot;Rescue Yourself From Rizing Intrest Rates.&quot; I need the lowest 
possible rate. For the mansion.</p> 
<p>Once I've furnished the mansion using numerous &quot;adjustable rate&quot; 
credit cards, and between electromagnetic anti-fat treatments, after I am 
comfortably ensconced in my corner office at Big Time Financiers Inc. on Wall 
Street, I will go back to the Net and procure an &quot;Affordible Real Good 
Brand Timepiece.&quot; I want a huge one. It's a sign of prosperity, you know. 
That's what the Net offer says, and what reason do I have to doubt it? I've 
never owned a Real Good Brand Timepiece, and I've never been prosperous. Pretty 
clear, isn't it? That's the beauty of mistaking constant conjunction for 
causality. Happens all the time on the Net.</p> 
<p>The lure and beauty of the Internet is undeniable: everything is 
uncluttered, misspelled, easy, makes sense. It's a virtual universe in which 
nothing is checked, where opinion passes for fact, where credit card numbers 
disappear into a black hole, where no one is accountable, where evidence 
disappears in a microsecond and denial and rage are the rules of the day. The 
Net is a perfect place to reshape a life, to get all the &quot;news,&quot; to 
tune into the finest minds of my generation. Or yours, for that matter.</p> 
<p>Even after I've ascended to the pinnacle, life-stylewise, I intend to 
continue to prowl the Internet, enhancing my intellectual, economic and social 
existence. Sky's the limit on the Web.</p> 
<p>I'll need the right kind of food to take along on my nightly trip. Since I 
won't be eating at the dining table any longer, but rather in my grotesquely 
over-decorated office in front of a bank of large-screen computer displays, the 
food will have to be served in a bowl (by one of the girls who find me 
unbearably attractive, or by Martin). Something I can eat with a spoon. 
Something with more substance than soup, which can gum up a keyboard in no time 
flat.</p> 
<p>What could be better than a stew? Especially since I will be negotiating a 
thick &quot;stew&quot; of information and opportunities on the Web.</p> 
<p>What kind of stew is preferred by a graduate of Success U., a streamlined 
babe magnet, a rising star in the world of international finance, and the owner 
of a &quot;No-Hands Doggie Pooper Scooper?&quot;</p> 
<p>Something that includes fine wine, of course - &quot;Get 4 Bottles of 
Connasur Wine per Month Delivered to Your Doors.&quot;</p> 
<p>A simple variation on boeuf bourguinon. (I will know how to pronounce this 
in a matter of weeks. That's how long it will take me to complete my 
&quot;Teach Yourself to Talk A Other Langage&quot; course.</p> 
<p>I'll need some chunks of beef chuck, maybe an inch and a half across. I'll 
need a few pieces of thick bacon, cut into hunks; a white onion, sliced; five 
or six cloves of garlic, thinly sliced; a bouquet garni with whatever's handy 
tied together (some fresh thyme, parsley stalks, a bay leaf, a small piece 
o'celery); a batch of frozen pearl onions, thawed; a mix of mushrooms, sliced 
(cremini, button, stemmed shitake, etc.); two carrots, chunked; a russet 
potato, peeled and chunked; maybe half a package of frozen green peas; some 
seasoned flour; tomato paste; a bit of Espanola red (optional - for you, not 
for me); a bottle of that &quot;Connasur Wine;&quot; two cups or so of unsalted 
beef stock; perhaps a smidge of veal demi-glace, if there's any hanging around 
the fridge (I can probably find a source on the Net).</p> 
<p>The beef is rolled in the flour and the excess is shaken off. The hunks of 
bacon are crisped up in olive oil in a Dutch oven over medium high heat then 
removed. The beef is cooked in the oil and bacon drippings, a few pieces at a 
time; when done, the browned pieces are removed to a paper towel to drain.</p> 
<p>Next, into the oil (with a bit more added if necessary) goes the sliced 
onion and half the chunked carrot. When the onion softens and the carrot begins 
to caramelize, in goes the garlic for a moment or two then the pan is deglazed 
with the &quot;Connasur Wine&quot; and the mix is reduced by half. In goes the 
meat, a tablespoon or so of tomato paste, the bouquet garni, the cooked bacon, 
most of the beef stock and a teaspoon of the Espanola red (optional - for you, 
not for me).</p> 
<p>The pan is covered and put into a 325 oven for three hours. I won't open 
the oven and the lid of the pan more than once.</p> 
<p>A half hour before the meat is to come out of the oven, I'll put a heavy 
fry pan on medium high heat. I'll cook the pearl onions in olive oil, add the 
mushrooms once the onions start to get golden, cook until the shrooms have 
given up their moisture, add the other carrots, cook a while longer, season.</p>
<p>I'll take the meat out of the broth and strain. Add the broth back to the 
Dutch oven, put in the meat, pearl onions, carrots, mushrooms and demi-glace. 
Add the potato. Pop the mix back in the oven for another hour, or until the 
meat, potato and carrot are fork tender. Add the peas for the last ten minutes 
or so. Reseason with care with Kosher salt and fresh-ground black pepper when 
the melange emerges from the oven.</p> 
<p>If the sauce is too thin for my liking, I'll strain the contents of the 
sauce, keep the meat and veggies in a covered, warm bowl and reduce the sauce 
on the stovetop. Once the sauce is to my liking, I'll add the goodies, put in a 
bowl, and enjoy.</p> 
<p>I'll eat with a large spoon. In the company of a hunk of buttered, crusty 
bread.</p> 
<p>I'll have a napkin handy; I don't want sauce on my mouse.</p> 
<p>That mouse and I are headed for the ship.</p>

<p><b>Inhaling and exhaling ... for health </b></p> 
<p><b>By Ming Steen</b></p> 
<p><b>SUN Columnist</b></p> 
<p>Last year, at the Alaska Zoo in Anchorage, staff members were scratching 
their heads about what to do with Maggie, an elephant who, at the time, weighed 
more than 9,000 pounds. Members of the species are, of course, supposed to be 
elephantine, but this particularly pudgy pachyderm had packed on too many 
pounds and was considered dangerously obese.</p> 
<p>The zoologists devised a high-fiber, high-fruit diet, and a 
&quot;behavioral enrichment&quot; approach e.g., placing food in hanging 
baskets to simulate natural foraging - to entice her to work for her food. But 
they also wanted Maggie, 25, to get more exercise, so they ordered a 20x5 
treadmill to help her get in shape and lose weight.</p> 
<p>She's since lost 1,000 pounds - even though her treadmill workouts are just 
beginning to get underway. Getting acclimated to the unfamiliar machine has 
posed its challenges. Ultimately, the goal is to get Maggie walking on the 
treadmill three times a day, for 30 minutes each session.</p> 
<p>So, while the Anchorage Zoo installs a 20x5 treadmill to the tune of 
$150,000 to help its elephant get into shape, McDonald's attempts to fill 
orders for healthier kids. </p> 
<p>Trying to sidestep any blame for the world's rising obesity levels, 
McDonald's has aligned itself, in a little way, with the fitness industry. 
Recently, the company unveiled its first two McDonald's R Gyms for kids at 
restaurants in Tulsa, Okla., and Whittier, Calif.</p> 
<p>Acknowledging that childhood obesity and diabetes have become widespread, 
McDonald's has now adopted a &quot;Balanced Active Lifestyle&quot; banner. The 
new gym, a refreshed version of the McDonald's Play Place, will offer &quot;a 
fun, easy and convenient way for children to increase their physical 
activity.&quot;</p> 
<p>The facilities are equipped with a variety of interactive game zones 
designed for children ages 4-12. Among the options: stationary bicycles 
attached to video games, dance pads, basketball hoops, monkey bars, obstacle 
courses and a number of other diversions intended to get kids to shape up 
before chowing down. There's also a Toddler Zone, which offers age-appropriate 
games to help develop physical coordination and social skills via climbing, 
sliding and ball play; an Active Zone, for kids 4-8, which promotes fitness 
through play; and a Sports Zone, which targets children ages 9-12 with a series 
of sports-oriented activities that encourages aerobic exercise.</p> 
<p>Aerobics exercise for some folks is as natural as inhaling and exhaling. I 
wish to congratulate the following for running in the Durango Double: Morgan 
Anderson, Karen Ross, Julie Greenly, Joe Gilbert, Jeff Ross, Leigh Gozigian, 
Stacia Aragon and Tammy Speeze. All eight ran the half marathon on Oct. 8 with 
250 other runners who logged the 13.1-mile foot race, while 183 runners did the 
26.2 miles of the full marathon.</p> 
<p>If you are looking for a small, fast, scenic half or full marathon next 
fall, the Durango Double is worth traveling an hour to. Besides, it's also a 
certified course for the Boston Marathon.</p> 
<p>This weekend, Karen Bunning, Cindy Gonzales, Sandy Gnos and Nikki Alley 
will be running a half marathon in Moab, Utah. Good luck, run well, and may the 
wind be to your back. Treat yourself to a McFlurry in Cortez on your way home.

<p><b>Cecil Hawkins</b></p> 
<p>Cecil Ray Hawkins, loving husband, father, grandfather, great-grandfather, 
brother, uncle, friend and respected demolition contractor and businessman, 
died suddenly at Bartlett Lake in Phoenix, Ariz., on the evening of Sept. 16, 
2006, of heart complications, at the age of 71.</p> 
<p>Born on Aug. 9, 1935, in Liberal, Kans., he was the youngest of four 
children. He married his high school sweetheart, Evelyn &quot;Doris&quot; 
Hawkins, on June 17, 1956, and they settled in Colorado in 1957, where they 
founded Hawkins Trucking and Excavating. He lived in Pagosa Springs from 1972 
to 1984, and expanded the company to include a sand and gravel pit and 
ready-mix plant on Put Hill. They moved to Phoenix in 1984, and further 
expanded the company to include heavy demolition. They formed Hawkins 
Enterprises, LLC in 2000. Cecil technically retired in 2004, however, never 
could stay away too long from the business that was his passion.</p> 
<p>A man of tremendous energy and kindness, Cecil was passionate about 
boating, fishing, hunting, traveling in his motor home and flying his own 
plane, until he was grounded by diabetes. He lived life with an unparalleled 
zest that was even demonstrated at death by the fact that he died while in the 
water at Bartlett Lake, where he enjoyed spending as much time as possible on 
his houseboat. Cecil never met a stranger, and was known for helping those who 
had a difficult time helping themselves. There was never a more kindhearted 
good samaritan. Although it was his heart that failed him in the end, he was a 
man of great heart who valued honesty and integrity above all. This world has 
lost a truly fine man, and he will be deeply missed by all those who knew and 
loved him.</p> 
<p>He is survived by Doris, his wife of over 50 years; his two children, Arla 
and Eric Hawkins; a daughter-in-law, Stacy Hawkins; four grandchildren, 
Nicholas and Nathan Stenzel, and Baine and Laurin Hawkins; two 
great-grandchildren, Beau and Seth Stenzel; a sister and brother-in-law, Jean 
and Joe Titus, of Arvada, Colo.; a sister-in-law, Helen Hawkins of Amarillo, 
Texas; a sister-in-law and brother-in-law, Eleanor and Bennett Galyean, of 
Macon, Ga.; four nieces, six nephews, numerous grandnieces and nephews, and 
cousins. He was preceded in death by both parents, his brother, Ronald Hawkins, 
and a sister who died in infancy.</p> 
<p>Funeral services were held on Monday, Sept. 25, 2006, at Phoenix Memorial 
Park and Mortuary.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, Oct. 24, the second in a series of three seminars to enhance 
small business effectiveness will be conducted.</p> 
<p>The mini-class will be held at the community center starting at 9 a.m. and 
will run until approximately noon. Continental breakfast and snacks at breaks 
will be provided. </p> 
<p>This month's class will be headed up by Joe Keck, director of the Small 
Business Development Center at Fort Lewis College and the topic will be getting 
the most out of your profit statement (if you even have one), maximizing your 
profits, and benchmarking (what's that?).</p> 
<p>Have you noticed that, though you work harder, you don't seem to be getting 
ahead? Are you running your business day-to-day, or can you run some 
comparables to analyze the past couple of years? Do you know why you are not 
doing as well as in previous years, or why you are doing so much better?</p> 
<p>This class is designed to help you take a serious look at your business and 
give you tips on how to maximize your revenues. Also, if you don't know where 
you've been, how do you know where you want to go?</p> 
<p>Cost of the class is $20 for Chamber members and $25 for nonmembers. Even 
if you are interested in starting a business, this seminar is a must in your 
business education. Call the Chamber at 264-2360 to reserve a spot, as seating 
is limited. Even if you think you know how to run your business well, I bet you 
can learn a few more tricks and run it even better.</p> 
<p>In November, a third class will be dedicated to educating small business 
owners about benefit packages. Speakers will present information about health 
benefits for owners and employees. We will also look at benefit savings plans 
that can afford businesses potential tax breaks. Your business may be able to 
offer benefits or savings plans. Come find out about the latest packages for 
your business.</p> 
<p>These mini-classes are offered in conjunction with the Fort Lewis College 
Small Business Development Center and Region 9 to help you be the best business 
owner or manager you can be. Invest in yourself and your business and attend 
one of these helpful seminars.</p>

<p>Holding wellness court at the Touch of the Tropics Spa, we have Matthew 
Marturano, ND joining us this week. Matthew offers naturopathic wellness 
services focusing on women's health and chronic pain. This talented individual 
adds his knowledge and gifts to the always expanding services of Touch of the 
Tropics. For an appointment or consultation, contact him at Touch of the 
Tropics at 264-1890.</p> 
<p>It's under new ownership, and we get to welcome the Pagosa Springs 
Welcoming Service, under the direction of Kathy Platz-Calderone. Greeters have 
been welcoming newcomers to Pagosa for over 32 years. This independently owned 
business offers newcomers a packet of goodies about the community and various 
organizations, business coupons, maps, and other helpful orientation 
information. If you are a newcomer and were not &quot;visited,&quot; call Kathy 
at 731-3857.</p> 
<p>Renewing with two businesses this week, we have Nan Rowe with Oso Grande 
Ranch and Rocky Mountain Reefs and Ponds. Also renewing are Eagle Eye 
Inspection Service; the Sheppeck Insurance Agency; Pagosa Springs Music 
Boosters; and the Pagosa Ranger District.</p> 
<p>I also want to use this space to thank the numerous businesses for again 
giving so generously to the Visitor Center Tourism Ambassador Thank You Gift 
Bag. Many of these diplomats will now continue their volunteering primarily on 
the weekends throughout the winter, an enhancement that we instituted last year 
at the center.</p> 
<p>Travelers appreciate the face-to-face interaction, especially when 
information is needed on state road conditions or activities and places to 
enjoy if everyone in the family is not skiing. These wonderfully-informed 
volunteers know that enhancing a visitor's stay strengthens the economy, for 
businesses, for the community. Without their generous participation, it would 
be difficult to keep the Visitor Center open seven days a week. Their 
assistance allows our staff to continue to provide other services to our 
visitors and to the community. Thank you to the businesses for showing their 
gratitude, and on behalf of the staff and board of directors of the Chamber of 
Commerce, I thank our tireless ambassadors for all their hard work and 
never-ending smiles! </p>

<p><b>&nbsp;</b><b>Janowsky</b></p> 
<p>The Janowsky family would like to thank all who participated in the 50th 
anniversary celebration for Mary Jo and Phil held at the community center 
Saturday, Oct. 7. The attendance and letters from those who could not attend 
made it a very special, heartwarming event for those honored.</p> 
<p>&quot;Partners in the Gospel&quot; was the theme of the celebration, taken 
from a favorite Scripture verse in Philippians 1:5 (KJV) where the Apostle Paul 
refers to his fellow workers as &quot;partners in the Gospel from the first day 
until now.&quot;</p> 
<p>The Janowskys were married in the college church of Houghton College in 
Western New York, where they met, and in 1956 began years of ministry together, 
concluding with Phil's pastoring the Community United Methodist Church here in 
Pagosa Springs until retirement in 1998. Mary Jo has taught school here for 10 
years, currently at Our Savior Lutheran School kindergarten.</p> 
<p>Friends from churches in Kansas and the San Luis Valley joined community 
friends for the reception given by the Janowsky's four children; Peggy Haslar, 
Dan, Andy and Mark Janowsky, with their spouses and grandsons. Andy Janowsky 
presented pictures on screen of family through the years, accompanied by his 
original songs, &quot;Family Portrait,&quot; &quot;I Am My Father's Son&quot; 
and &quot;The Love of My Mother.&quot;</p> 
<p>Once again, thanks to all who have supported them in their marriage and 
ministry over the last 50 years. </p> 
<p><b>&nbsp;</b><b>Casa de los Arcos</b></p> 
<p>Thank you from Casa de los Arcos to the following people and organizations 
for their generous donations:</p> 
<p>Robert Kear for the donated food items; May Lou Bahr for the computer; 
Loaves and Fishes, as always, for the delicious lunches and the leftovers, and 
Harold Morrison and the other volunteers for delivery of the meals on 
Thursdays; Coyote Hill Lodge and Gina for the chuckwagon dinner tickets at the

<p><b>&nbsp;</b><b>Francavilla</b></p> 
<p>On Friday our fox terrier Token took off scared because of the gunshots 
going off around our house. We looked until dark for him but to no avail. 
Saturday we were posting posters and looking once again and then we returned 
home.</p> 
<p>He never made it back home; someone had hit him on the highway.</p> 
<p>To the lady that stopped and got him off the highway and called our vet's 
office, we want to say a big &quot;thank you&quot; for being so kind as to not 
leave him on the highway and for getting his collar and informing our vet.</p> 
<p>To Mike (who saw a poster) a big thank you for calling us and letting us 
know where the nice lady had placed our little guy, and for waiting there until 
we came for Token. </p> 
<p>It makes our hearts feel a little less heavy knowing there were two 
kindhearted people who cared. Once again a heart felt thank you to you both.</p>

<p>Kathryn (Kate) Terry's family wish to thank all her many friends for the

<p><b>&nbsp;</b><b>Stahr family</b></p> 
<p>The Stahr family would like to thank this wonderful community for the 
prayers, loving help and support given to us during this difficult time. We 
have lived in Pagosa for over 30 years, we have deep roots here, all of our 
children went through school in this town and we have made many friends over 
the years. I guess you never think of all the people you know until you have a 
tragic moment in your life and they are all there for you. </p> 
<p>As you know, Travis spent six and half weeks at Swedish Medical Center in 
Englewood. During that time we received much comfort from the community back 
home. It has been a very trying time not only for us, but for the whole town, 
and especially for the families and extended families of the boys in the 
accident. Even though we were in Englewood, we felt the love and support from 
home. The prayers, visits, donations, phone calls, e-mails, cards and letters 
were so much comfort. We were astounded by the outpouring of love and support. 
When employees of the hospital would comment on it we would say &quot;only in 
Pagosa.&quot;</p> 
<p>Since Travis has returned home, we have continued to feel the support. 
Although Travis is still recuperating, with daily therapies and a court trial 
pending, he has had countless visitors and phone calls. We constantly hear 
&quot;we're still praying for you.&quot; That speaks volumes, and warms our 
hearts through the tears.</p> 
<p>People often ask after such a tragedy, &quot;How do you handle all 
this?&quot; We feel the answer is strong faith, and good friends. You just keep 
doing what you have to do, and before you know it, you realize you are not 
walking alone.</p> 
<p>We know this is not God's fault. It was just as Eccl. 9:11 states: &quot;I 
returned to see under the sun that the swift do not have the race, nor the 
mighty ones the battle, nor do the wise also have the food, nor do the 
understanding ones also have the riches, nor do even those having knowledge 
have the favor, because time and unforeseen occurrence befall them all.&quot; 
Our loving Heavenly Father, Jehovah, does not orchestrate the bad that happens 
to us, He just gives us the support we need to endure the trials that come our 
way.</p> 
<p>We also want to extend our deepest sympathy to the Regester-Shahan, and the 
Shelton-Maestas families. Our hearts ache for you. It is so hard to make sense 
of tragedy. Our family has lost before and we know the hurt of that loss. In a 
way we can understand your loss now. Please remember that Jehovah is the God of 
all comfort. He alone can help us all heal.</p> 
<p>Again, thank you friends, neighbors and community for all the love and 
support given by you during this time of trial in our lives. Know that you are 
loved and appreciated in return.</p> 
<p>With hearts full,</p>

<p><b>Pirates beat Centauri, face Monte Vista Friday </b></p> 
<p><b>By Louis Sherman</b></p> 
<p><b>Staff Writer</b></p> 
<p>Faced with a must-win homecoming game, the Pirates shut out the Centauri 
Falcons 26-0, scoring a touchdown in every quarter and gaining nearly 350 yards 
total offense.</p> 
<p>Pagosa pushed it into the end zone the first drive of the game, after 
starting with good field position at their own 45-yard line. After a 24-yard 
pass completion from Jordan Shaffer to a diving Adam Trujillo, which put the 
Pirates on the 1-yard line, Corbin Mellette drove through the line for a 
goal-line TD. </p> 
<p>The Pirates' second touchdown came on a 30-yard sideline reception by John 
Hoffman, with eight minutes remaining in the half. The offense was put in 
striking distance by a 31-yard reception by Kerry Joe Hilsabeck.</p> 
<p>Pagosa threatened with another score at the close of the second half, after 
an interception was returned 59 yards by Hilsabeck. On the next play, Shaffer 
launched a missile, traveling over half the field's length in the air, to hit 
Hoffman in the end zone. Hoffman had to twist awkwardly to receive the pass, 
and the ball bounced off his chest.</p> 
<p>Halfway through the third quarter, the Pirates found success through the 
air again - with a 21-yard screen to Trujillo, a slant to Hilsabeck that moved 
the chains 45 yards after several broken tackles, and a 16-yard TD catch by 
Hoffman.</p> 
<p>The Pirates' final score came when Shaffer ran back an interception, his 
second of the game, 35 yards into the end zone.</p> 
<p>The Pirates did not convert extra-points in the second half, after kicker 
(and receiver) Derek Harper left the game with an injury.</p> 
<p>Shaffer threw for 168 yards, with two touchdowns (to go along with his 
interception return). He also led the team in rushing with 73 yards, most of 
which came on a 58-yard run in the second quarter, slightly ahead of Mellette, 
who finished with 67 yards.</p> 
<p>Hilsabeck gained the most receiving yards, with 76 on two receptions, while 
Hoffman's two receptions went for TDs.</p> 
<p>The shutout game belied several threatening drives by the Falcons. After a 
fake punt, Centauri's opening drive came within striking distance, but two pass 
attempts were thwarted by the Pirates. Joe DuCharme tipped a pass incomplete, 
and on the next play, Shaffer made a tip and followed through to pull in an 
interception on his own 1-yard line.</p> 
<p>The Pirates would punt shortly after, giving the Falcons excellent field 
position, but the defense held, forcing Centauri to turn the ball over on downs.
</p> 
<p>In the second quarter, the Falcons maintained a plodding drive for over six 
minutes, covering 59 yards. But, again, the Pirate defense held, this time with 
a goal-line stand that stopped a quarterback keeper on the 1-yard line.</p> 
<p>Another Falcon possession went to naught in the second quarter with 
Hilsabeck's interception deep in the red zone.</p> 
<p>In addition to the Pirates' 346 yards total offense, the Pirate defense 
gained 101 yards on returns.</p> 
<p>The Pirates were not able to bask in the glory of their homecoming win this 
week, since they face a tougher opponent and more decisive game Friday in Monte 
Vista, against the Pirates of the San Luis Valley.</p> 
<p>The two Pirate teams will draw battle lines with only two Mountain League 
losses between them.</p> 
<p>Both teams lost to league-leader Salida, while beating competitive Buena 
Vista.</p> 
<p>Each team has a 2-1 league record. </p> 
<p>Coach Sean O'Donnell said it is not unusual for the season to come down to 
the Monte Vista game, but usually the two teams battle it out for first place. 
This year they fight for second and to avoid elimination from playoff 
contention.</p> 
<p>If Pagosa wins against Monte Vista, and then beats Bayfield the following 
week, they will be guaranteed a playoff birth.</p> 
<p>With a loss to either team, the Pirates will need to rely on a wild card, 
which is not guaranteed.</p> 
<p>Monte Vista is 5-2 overall, and beat Bayfield 32-15 last week. After their 
game with the Pirates, they will face Centauri, so Pagosa cannot count on 
someone else beating them.</p> 
<p>O'Donnell said Monte Vista will come out hungry, since they have not beat 
Pagosa in several years - and now it is for survival.</p> 
<p>&quot;The biggest key is to match their intensity,&quot; he said.</p> 
<p>He went on to say that Monte Vista has run the same offense and defense for 
many years, so there won't be any surprises.</p> 
<p>It will be a matter of winning a game of smash-mouth football.</p> 
<p>Though the Pirates came into the year with a one-back, shotgun offense, it 
has added plays from under the center and a two-back set. The defense came in 
running a 3-5-3 formation but now frequently runs a four-man front.</p> 
<p>The run-and-gun, slash-and-sack team has balanced its speed game with 
pounding the trenches - which will be a good match for Monte Vista.</p> 
<p>Expect a battle.</p> 
<p>The game starts at 7 p.m. at Monte Vista High School. The volleyball team 
plays in Monte Vista the same night, so expect a strong Pagosa contingent over 
the pass.</p> 
<p>The Pirates will face Bayfield next Thursday at 7 p.m., in Pagosa, for 
their last regular season game - the game rescheduled from the original Friday 
night date to avoid conflict with the volleyball district tournament Friday.</p>

<p><b>Pirate girls capture league title, Harms is Runner of the Year </b></p> 
<p><b>By Louis Sherman</b></p> 
<p><b>Staff Writer</b></p> 
<p>Six Pagosa runners won all-conference honors and Jaclyn Harms claimed the 
title of Runner of the Year in the Intermountain League, while the girls' team 
came in first at the league meet last Saturday in Monte Vista.</p> 
<p>Harms was joined by Jessica Lynch, Julia Adams and Laurel Reinhardt on the 
girls' all-conference team. Jackson Walsh and Travis Furman made the boys' 
all-conference team. </p> 
<p>Both teams were successful at the meet, with the girls claiming first 
place, yet again, and the boys winning the silver behind Monte Vista - beating 
Bayfield for the first time, who finished third.</p> 
<p>Harms won the girls' race, taking the lead less than a mile into the race, 
followed by Lynch in third, Adams in fourth and Reinhardt in seventh - who 
combined for a team victory with 15 points.</p> 
<p>According to Coach Scott Anderson, &quot;Jacie is feeling more comfortable 
running on her own at the front now, and watching her run that strong after our 
bye week was impressive.&quot;</p> 
<p>Regarding the strong girls' team, Anderson said &quot;We know that, as a 
team, we should not be seriously challenged until state, so every race we try 
to keep focus and work on the mental side, so we are ready when we are 
challenged, because that state meet will be a whole other story.&quot;</p> 
<p>Walsh and Furman ran as a tandem in the boys' race and finished 
neck-and-neck in third and fourth places, respectively.</p> 
<p>&quot;Although we were a bit disconsolate about being runner-up yet again, 
we got one monkey off our back by finishing ahead of Bayfield, and have showed 
that we are true contenders,&quot; said Anderson.</p> 
<p>He went on to say, &quot;This was another very good day for our program - 
the kids performed well and brought home an impressive haul of hardware.&quot;
</p> 
<p>The teams will return to Monte Vista this Saturday for the regional meet, 
where they will attempt to qualify for state.</p>

<p><b>Pirates beat Ignacio in three, IML season ends this weekend </b></p> 
<p><b>By Karl Isberg</b></p> 
<p><b>Staff Writer</b></p> 
<p>It was the Pirates' homecoming volleyball match.</p> 
<p>There was a large and enthusiastic crowd in the PSHS gym.</p> 
<p>The match itself was a short, one-sided affair as Pagosa skated past the 
Bobcats 25-10, 25-10, 25-17. </p> 
<p>That Ignacio broke into double figures in any of the three games was a 
measure of Pagosa's generosity. The visitors seemed listless and dispirited 
from the outset, and the Pirates were intent on securing the Intermountain 
League victory.</p> 
<p>With the Bobcats' attack reduced to the occasional hit by junior A.J. 
Vigil, a significant number of Pagosa's points came on Ignacio errors on 
offense. On defense, the Bobcats' inability to block the quick attack from the 
Pirates' side of the net made life doubly difficult for the league cellar 
dwellers. </p> 
<p>The first game of the match was tied at 2-2. Soon after, Pagosa had a 12-5 
lead, with two kills by Alaina Garman and aces by Erin Gabel and Danielle 
Spencer. Kim Canty was at serve for five points.</p> 
<p>Gabel hit cross-court from the right side, Jennifer Haynes nailed two aces 
and the Pirates were ahead 16-7.</p> 
<p>The Bobcats got two points on Pagosa hitting errors, gave up a point and 
scored their final point of the game on a tip (only the second earned point for 
the visitors).</p> 
<p>From there, it was all Pirates, as Pagosa went on an eight-point run to end 
the game. The Pirates got earned points from Canty with a kill from the right 
side, on a stuff by Spencer and Kim Fulmer, on a kill of a quick set from the 
middle by Spencer and with a kill of a short set on the outside by Spencer.</p> 
<p>Fulmer got her team off to a fast start in game two, the senior putting a 
kill down from the strong side. She and Haynes scored with a stuff, Haynes solo 
blocked an Ignacio hitter, Canty hit an ace and Haynes put an errant Bobcat 
pass to the back corner of the court. Pagosa was up 7-0.</p> 
<p>The visitors scored with a tip, but Haynes responded with an off-speed shot 
on the quick set. Pagosa gave away three points with hitting errors; Gabel (who 
hit .375 during the match) nailed a shot down the line from the right side then 
went up to crush a Bobcat pass that strayed over the net. Gabel then went to 
the right side and hit another kill.</p> 
<p>Ahead 11-6, Pagosa put together a five-point run that began with a kill 
from the middle by Garman and ended when Spencer scored, putting another errant 
Bobcat pass to the floor.</p> 
<p>Ignacio's points came one at a time. </p> 
<p>Pagosa's points came six at a time, with Ignacio handing over five freebies 
with mistakes and Spencer hitting an ace. A serve error gave the Bobcats a 
point; Canty killed for a point and Fulmer put the Pirates at game point with a 
stuff. </p> 
<p>Ignacio scored one more time to break into double figures; Haynes nailed a 
quick set in the middle, putting the ball to the sideline. Game over.</p> 
<p>But for a series of charity points given to Ignacio with sloppy play, the 
Pirates would have finished off the match in near-record time. Canty killed to 
start the third game then hit an ace on a jump serve. Gabel scored with a tip 
off a poor pass, but the Pirates committed three serve errors and a line 
violation to allow the Bobcats to stay two points behind at 6-4.</p> 
<p>Canty, who hit .500 on the night, took back serve with a kill and, with a 
blast from outside by Fulmer, and Garman at the line hitting two aces, Pagosa 
was suddenly up 12-4.</p> 
<p>The Pirates went ahead 18-8 with a kill from the middle by Lacy Jones and 
another point from Fulmer, this time on a back-row attack, and it seemed Pagosa 
would cruise to another quick victory. But, play on Pagosa's side of the net 
got sloppy at times and a series of passing errors gave away points. The 
Pirates got their share of giveaways, scored a point on a rocket from Fulmer 
and led 22-13.</p> 
<p>Ignacio received three unearned points from Pagosa and scored with a stuff; 
Fulmer took back serve with a kill, Allison Hart hit an ace and a Bobcat hit 
went out to end game and match.</p> 
<p>&quot;It was a good, balanced effort,&quot; said Coach Andy Rice. &quot;We 
gave away too many points, but we kept the pressure on. We had a nine-player 
rotation and everyone contributed.&quot; </p> 
<p>With starting outside hitter Camille Rand resting a leg injury, Rice said 
the Pirates needed some additional effort. &quot;With Camille out, we needed 
people to step up. Kim (Canty) and Erin (Gabel) shouldered a lot of that 
burden.&quot;</p> 
<p>Rice put several of his swing players into the third game of the match and 
the coach was happy with the result. &quot;This was a good chance for some of 
our other players to get in and feel some pressure.</p> 
<p>&quot;We were trying to get on a roll (with the win, Pagosa had four 
victories in five matches) and we took a good step.&quot;</p> 
<p>Fulmer led the way on offense, with seven kills; Canty had five kills

<p><b>Pirates drop second match of year to Bayfield </b></p> 
<p><b>By Karl Isberg</b></p> 
<p><b>Staff Writer</b></p> 
<p>The Bayfield jinx continued Tuesday night as the Pirate volleyball team 
dropped its second regular-season match to the Wolverines, the second league 
loss for Pagosa this year. </p> 
<p>The Wolverines sewed up the league title with the 25-18, 25-23, 25-22 win 
before a large and noisy crowd in their home gym and, as in the first match of 
the season, with two teams evenly matched in talent and experience, the 
difference came down to composure and mistakes.</p> 
<p>The victory was not easy for the hosts, though the Pirates started slow, 
dropping behind 14-7 in the first game. Bayfield put together a four-point run 
to extend the lead to 19-11 before Pagosa outscored them 5-2 to close the gap 
to 21-16.</p> 
<p>A three-point Wolverine run, keyed by two Pirate errors, put the home team 
at game point. Junior outside hitter Camille Rand gave the Pirates a point with 
a kill and a Bayfield hitting error provided another point for Pagosa. The 
comeback stopped dead in its tracks when a Pirate serve went into the net, 
giving the Wolverines the victory.</p> 
<p>The Pirates struggled to keep up through the first half of the second game 
of the match, finally tying the score at 15-15. The offense began to click, 
with kills from Rand, Alaina Garman, Jennifer Haynes and Danielle Spencer. The 
Pirates also scored with tandem stuff blocks by Rand and Haynes, and Spencer 
and Erin Gabel.</p> 
<p>It was a seesaw battle from that point on. Bayfield went ahead 16-15; Gabel 
tied it with a kill from the right side. Bayfield went up 17-16; Kim Fulmer 
killed from the strong side. Pagosa went ahead 18-17 on a kill by Garman; 
Bayfield returned the favor. Haynes hit a soft shot to the back line; a Pagosa 
error gave Bayfield a point and the 19-19 tie.</p> 
<p>Pagosa managed to create some distance: Haynes put a short set down from 
the middle then hit an ace serve. But the Pirates could not hold the 21-19 
advantage; two hitting errors and a Bayfield kill put the hosts back in the 
lead 22-21.</p> 
<p>Rand tied the score 22-22 with a kill but a Pirate attack went out. A 
Bayfield serve error knotted the teams at 23 and it was anyone's game. A Pirate 
hitting error and a Pagosa player into the net made it Bayfield's game, 25-23.
</p> 
<p>The Pirates went out to a 6-5 lead in the third game, using kills by Garman 
and Haynes and an ace by Haynes.</p> 
<p>Bayfield fought back to take a 10-7 lead and, despite kills from Garman, 
Rand and Haynes, the Pirates remained behind until the end-game. With her team 
lagging 17-21, Mariah Howell hit an ace off the tape, but a serve error gave a 
point and serve to the Wolverines. Garman responded with a kill down the line 
and Bayfield committed a passing error to surrender a point. Garman hit line 
again and yet another Wolverine mistake knotted the score 22-22.</p> 
<p>That would be it for the Pirates. A Bayfield hit went down inside the block 
and two consecutive balls hit out surrendered the game and match to Bayfield.
</p> 
<p>Garman led the way on offense for Pagosa with seven kills; Rand had five. 
Kim Canty had 15 assists; Haynes solo blocked Wolverine hitters three times 
during the match, Spencer twice. Iris Frye had 19 digs.</p> 
<p>Now, Pagosa has to wait, win and hope for another crack at Bayfield. </p> 
<p>The Pirates need to win their two remaining league matches - tomorrow at 
Monte Vista and home Saturday against Centauri - to secure second seed when 
they host the district tournament Oct. 27-28. With only one team advancing out 
of districts to regionals, it all comes down to a round-robin win the third 
week of October.</p> 
<p>Friday's match at Monte Vista is set for 7 p.m. as is the last 
regular-season home match against Centauri, Saturday at the PSHS gym.</p>

<p><b>Pagosa soccer ends season with 5-1 win </b></p> 
<p><b>By Louis Sherman</b></p> 
<p><b>Staff Writer</b></p> 
<p>The Pirates ended a two-week drought and three-game conference losing 
streak, which took them out of playoff contention, by beating Bayfield 5-1 
Tuesday.</p> 
<p>With the win, the Pirates ended the season by successfully meeting a 
challenge they have faced all year. </p> 
<p>Pagosa has been hampered by the ineligibility of key players. And while the 
playoff race was on, the Pirates lost key games to Center and Telluride due, in 
large part, to starters who were ineligible.</p> 
<p>Roster instability sapped morale and challenged game plans. When the 
Pirates have had a full team this season, they have utilized quick attacks on 
offense. With front-line players ineligible or injured, the team was forced to 
adapt its offense and lineup.</p> 
<p>Coach Lindsey Kurt-Mason said that the ineligibility issue made the season 
particularly difficult, because the players never knew who they would be 
playing with. Faced with key roster changes, it can take a team &quot;weeks and 
weeks and weeks to adapt,&quot; he said.</p> 
<p>It only took the Pirates two weeks, though the transition time meant losing 
two important games, including last Thursday's loss against Center, 2-1.</p> 
<p>The Pirates' lone goal in Center highlighted the significant contributions 
of freshman this season, especially with upperclassmen ineligible.</p> 
<p>Late in the game, Josh Whipple fed Dustin Anderson from midfield. After 
receiving the pass in the open field, Anderson took three touches before taking 
an outside shot on the far post, finding the net.</p> 
<p>The Pirates lost more convincingly against Telluride last Saturday, away 
from home, 5-1.</p> 
<p>Profirio Palma scored the Pirates only goal 26 minutes into the first half, 
and the Pirates were neck-and-neck with their opponents at intermission, 2-1.
</p> 
<p>But three Telluride goals in the second half put it away for the hosts.</p> 
<p>Kurt-Mason noted Telluride was the better team that day, faced with a 
Pagosa squad missing three starting forwards, but said the game could have gone 
the other way if not for a collection of unfortunate miscues and calls that 
didn't go the Pirates' way.</p> 
<p>After the tough losses, Kurt-Mason made the difficult decision to bench 
starters returning from ineligibility in order to keep the lineup stable and 
maintain the cohesion that had been built in their absence.</p> 
<p>As a result of Kurt-Mason's confidence in his team, the Pirates completed 
their adaptation against Bayfield and clicked as a unit, relying on control, 
passing and conversion in the box.</p> 
<p>And on that cold, rainy Tuesday, the Pirates put in their best play of the 
season.</p> 
<p>The Pirates did not rely on the fast break, but consistently converted off 
passes into the box.</p> 
<p>Senior midfielder Caleb Ormonde led the Pirates to a 2-0 lead at the half. 
His first goal came off a defensive feed from Tesh Parker to Palma, who passed 
it to Ormonde in the middle. Ormonde dribbled around three defenders in the box 
for the shot and goal.</p> 
<p>With a minute remaining in the half, Ormonde scored on the &quot;play of 
the year,&quot; said Kurt-Mason.</p> 
<p>On the Pirates' side of midfield, Ormonde shouldered-up against a Bayfield 
player for an air ball. The Wolverine went up for the header, but was out of 
position. Ormonde made the appropriate read and let the ball fall. He then 
headed it off the bounce to control the ball and start a run.</p> 
<p>Ormonde dribbled through defenders to the sideline, where he was met by 
several attempted tackles. One defender threatened to clear the ball out of 
bounds, but Ormonde fought for possession and to keep the ball in play, while 
running along the sideline.</p> 
<p>&quot;There was a guy on his back the whole way down,&quot; said Kurt-Mason.
</p> 
<p>After fighting to keep the ball in play, Ormonde drove into the box and put 
a controlled shot into the net, past the goalie.</p> 
<p>Ormonde was a workhorse throughout the season, said Kurt-Mason. He was a 
consistent force at midfield, stuffing opponents' transitions into offense and 
frequently threatening with strong shots.</p> 
<p>A minute into the second half, forward Clayton King converted in the box, 
off a pass from Thomas Schmidt.</p> 
<p>A minute later, Whipple scored on a rebound off an outside shot by Kevin 
Blue.</p> 
<p>Whipple threatened frequently during the game, knowing right where to be as 
a striker, despite being a freshman.</p> 
<p>Freshmen, like Ryan Searle, Whipple and Anderson, played like upperclassmen 
and were a significant part of the team effort.</p> 
<p>The final goal of the game was also a conversion goal, off the head of 
Blue. Zel Johnston chipped the ball from the left side, giving Blue the 
opportunity to punch the ball in from the near to far post.</p> 
<p>Bayfield's only goal came on a penalty kick with 15 minutes in the game.</p>
<p>Though not slated to start in the goal, Michael Schmidt put in several 
diving saves and would have had a shutout, if not for an unnecessary penalty in 
the box.</p> 
<p>With the win, Pagosa finished the season with a 6-4 league record, behind 
Crested Butte and Telluride. </p> 
<p>The effort showed what they were capable of as a team -- and would likely 
have accomplished if not for ineligibility.</p> 
<p>&quot;We should have been 10-0,&quot; said Kurt-Mason.</p> 
<p>Along with Ormonde, the Pirates are graduating six seniors - Tadd Beavers, 
Tesh Parker, Max Smith, Clayton King and Palma.</p> 
<p>But six juniors will return next year, along with several varsity 
sophomores and freshmen.</p> 
<p>Kurt-Mason said there is also a strong JV team to fill in the ranks.</p> 
<p>The Pirates are at their best as a controlled, strategic team. If they 
learn from improvements this year, 10-0 might be in the realm of possibility 
next season. </p>

<p><b>By Lynne Allison</b></p> 
<p><b>Special to The SUN</b></p> 
<p>The Pagosa Women's Golf Association fielded eight of its lowest handicap 
players to play the last team play event of the season at the San Juan Country 
Club in Farmington, Oct. 5.</p> 
<p>The Pagosa ladies managed to garner 27 1/2 points against the host San Juan 
Country Club team on a cold and rainy day. Playing conditions were less than 
desirable, as it rained the entire round except the last two holes. Then, to 
add to the misery, it rained and stormed the entire trip home.</p> 
<p>Competing for Pagosa were Barbara Sanborn, Lynne Allison, Cherry O'Donnell, 
Jane Day, Bonnie Hoover, Bev Hudson, Josie Hummel and Loretta Campuzano.</p> 
<p>Final team placement points for the season were as follows: 1. Pinon Hills 
Golf Club, 306.5; 2. Cortez Conquistador, 302; 3. Aztec Hidden Valley, 298.5; 
4. Kirtland Riverview, 288; 5. Dalton Ranch Golf Club, 283; 6. San Juan Country 
Club, 281.5; 7. Hillcrest Golf Club, 277; 8. Pagosa Springs Golf Club, 267.5.
</p> 
<p>Team captain Sanborn said, &quot;Our team's final placement in the league 
does not indicate how we played. Many of our team members dropped their 
handicaps during the season, and competed very well with our opponents. We did 
the best we could, and we can only improve.&quot; She added, &quot;The 
forthcoming team play season looks really bright.&quot; Sanborn extends her 
many thanks and deep gratitude to all of the women who participated in team 
play this year - their dedication and willingness to compete are commendable.

<p>Also representing Pagosa during the season were Kay Crumpton, Jan Kilgore, 
Marilyn Smart, Jane Stewart, Carrie Weisz, Julie Pressley, Nancy Chitwood,

<p></p> 
<p><b>After all, you are the boss </b></p> 
<p>You are a taxpaying citizen; you cast your vote in local, state and 
national elections. You elect representatives you believe will inform 
themselves about issues in ways you haven't the time or energy to do; you elect 
them to then make reasonable decisions for the best for the greatest number of 
people they represent. And for you. Their boss.</p> 
<p>And how do you, the boss, and your fellow bosses keep track of the 
representative system you put in place, of the elected officials, and the 
administrators and bureaucrats those officials hire? How do you stay abreast of 
the biggest and hottest issues, as well as of the minutiae of business in a 
structured society?</p> 
<p>You obtain information. In many cases, the bosses rely on others to ferret 
out the information - journalists of all sorts. Yet, other times, when it comes 
to certain records, less than spectacular information that can, nonetheless, 
make a big difference in a life, the boss must procure it him or herself. </p> 
<p>In the newspaper business, we are constantly seeking information, asking 
for records, asking to see the minutes of meetings, to listen to tape 
recordings made at meetings of elected officials.</p> 
<p>Here in Pagosa Country, resistance to requests is rare. Seldom has a 
district or official refused information and been forced to turn over records 
following a formal legal request. Generally, when we ask to hear the tape of a 
meeting, we meet no resistance. Seldom have we been refused data concerning an 
issue or process in the public realm. This is appreciated; it is our job to 
bring that information to light. It is also positive for the governmental 
bodies, the elected officials, the administrators and other employees. 
Resistance sends a clear signal there is something wrong; it engenders more 
pointed suspicion and leads to a more vigorous pursuit.</p> 
<p>But, for the ordinary citizen, it is not always easy. So says a study 
conducted by 23 newspapers of The Associated Press and the Colorado Press 
Association. The study was conducted in 21 communities across the state and 
sought to obtain records from counties, municipalities, special districts and 
school districts. Survey participants included reporters, members of the 
general public, interns and others.</p> 
<p>In some instances, a vast array of records was already online and other 
requests were met promptly, with attention to the law. In too many cases, 
requests were met with confusion, rudeness, suspicion. Survey members found 
school districts, overall, regarded requests with the most suspicion, often 
quizzing those who made requests about who they were and why they wanted 
information, The law does not give any district more latitude than others. 
Court rulings have made it clear requests - even for things like e-mails 
between elected officials and employees - can be made without identifying who 
you are or why you want the information. The questions can be asked; they need 
not be answered.</p> 
<p>In cases where information is not readily available, government can wait 
three working days before providing it - but why wait if it is readily 
available?</p> 
<p>Bottom line: Under the Colorado Public Records Law, with some exceptions 
for personnel or proprietary commercial information, a citizen is entitled to 
see any public record, in any form, that has been created, maintained and used 
in the carrying out of government's duties or in the receipt and use of public 
funds.</p> 
<p>If you want to know something about government and elected officials - with 
the slender prohibitions in the law in mind - ask. Having information, from all 
manner of public entities, can make a significant difference in your life. If 
you meet resistance, do not give up your right.</p> 
<p>After all, you are the boss.</p>

<p><b>Students complete campground projects </b></p> 
<p><b>James Robinson</b></p> 
<p><b>Staff Writer</b></p> 
<p>Getting young people interested in the outdoors is one of Elizabeth 
Parker's passions, and what began as a senior project for her bachelor's of 
science degree in human services, has become woven into the service learning 
curriculum at the Archuleta County High School.</p> 
<p>To date, the program has included two maintenance and cleanup projects of 
area campgrounds, and marks a collaboration between the high school, the San 
Juan Mountains Association, the Pagosa Ranger District of the San Juan National 
Forest and United Land Management.</p> 
<p>The students completed their most recent project at the Ute and Blanco 
River campgrounds Oct. 12.</p> 
<p>According to Parker and Danielle Sullivan, the service learning coordinator 
at the high school, the thrust of the program is to get the students outside 
and engaged in physical activity, while bolstering the high school's service 
learning curriculum that, in part, teaches students the importance of giving 
back to the community.</p> 
<p>&quot;The project began last March with an e-mail from Liz. She wondered if 
I would be interested in the alternative school kids doing a public service 
project,&quot; said Hal Hess, area manager for United Land Management.</p> 
<p>United Land Management operates under a permit from the Forest Service to 
administer and maintain many of the area's campgrounds.</p> 
<p>Hess was receptive to the idea, and Parker took the lead, making the 
connections with Forest Service personnel and staff at the alternative school.
</p> 
<p>&quot;Kevin gave us his blessing, and the staff at the alternative school 
was really supportive,&quot; Parker said. </p> 
<p>Kevin Khung is district ranger on the Pagosa Ranger District of the San 
Juan National Forest.</p> 
<p>In early May, armed with gallons of paint, rollers, paint brushes and 
sandpaper - supplied largely with a $200 grant from Terry's Ace Hardware - 16 
students and five faculty including Doug Bowen, director of the school, arrived 
at the Ute Campground near the junction of U.S. 160 and Colo. 151.</p> 
<p>&quot;In three and a half hours, they painted the outside of two bathrooms 
and sanded and painted about 36 picnic tables,&quot; Hess said.</p> 
<p>The day was chalked up as a tremendous success, however Hess wasn't sure 
what he'd gotten himself into after gauging the students' attitudes upon their 
arrival at the campground in the morning.</p> 
<p>&quot;They were not happy campers when they first arrived. They didn't look 
happy to be there,&quot; Hess said.</p> 
<p>But after about 30 minutes, Hess said, their moods changed.</p> 
<p>&quot;After a while, they started challenging each other - 'Who can paint a 
table the fastest?' They had fun,&quot; Hess said.</p> 
<p>But moreover, Hess said, the students exhibited a sense of pride and 
satisfaction in what they had achieved.</p> 
<p>&quot;It was quantitative. They could see their work. There was pride in 
the job they'd done,&quot; Hess said.</p> 
<p>Although, Parker's senior project was behind her, the success of that first 
service project led her to approach Hess and school staff for collaboration on 
a second undertaking scheduled last week. Sullivan and Hess agreed, and Oct. 12 
brought 29 students back to Ute Campground where they piled mountains of slash 
left after a Forest Service fuels reduction and thinning project.</p> 
<p>Hess said about 400 green trees had been marked for thinning and the result 
was hundreds and hundreds of sticky, pitch-covered limbs in need of hauling 
away.</p> 
<p>&quot;The kids spent about three hours, they worked like little beavers, 
piling it all into big piles,&quot; Hess said.</p> 
<p>While some students hauled slash, Hess had others filling potholes in the 
campground's roads with wheelbarrows and shovels, and pruning trees using pole 
trimmers.</p> 
<p>Parker said the morning began much as Hess described last May.</p> 
<p>&quot;At first they act like they've been forced to come. They're kind of 
resistant at first, but after thirty minutes into the project, I notice a 
change. The way they get into it is amazing.&quot; Parker said.</p> 
<p>After tackling the clean up at the Ute Campground the students then 
traveled to the Blanco Campground where they sanded and painted all the tables 
and benches in the Blanco River Picnic Area and the campground - a task they 
completed in two hours Hess said.</p> 
<p>Hess said the success of the last two outings has led key players to talk 
of making it a regularly scheduled twice yearly event.</p> 
<p>&quot;It's a win-win. We need the work, they need the public service and 
work experience, and learning to finish what they've started. That's so 
important these days,&quot; Hess said. </p> 
<p>And Parker added &quot;Service learning is important, you're doing it for 
yourselves, the public and the community.&quot;</p> 
<p>&quot;Service learning is something I try to emphasize. The learning is an 
important part of the phrase. You need to know how and why your doing the 
project. It also give us a chance to interact at a totally different level. 
We're out there side by side, hauling brush and painting tables - we're on 
equal ground,&quot; Sullivan said.</p> 
<p>Although two of the students, Lastin Johnston and Ryan Bromley both spoke 
about the experience in slightly different terms than Sullivan - &quot;pretty 
cool&quot; was their shared description - both enjoyed being outside and 
working alongside their friends.</p> 
<p>Bromley said in addition to the campground projects he is also involved in 
a long-term service project with the Archuleta County Victim's Assistance 
Program, and helped create a teen-oriented educational campaign called KPASA - 
Kids Preventing Abuse and Sexual Assault.</p> 
<p>Sullivan said Bromley's work with the victim's assistance program is just 
one example of myriad service learning possibilities available to the students. 
Sullivan said she maintains networks with numerous local agencies, from the 
humane society to the sheriff's office, in order to match students interests 
with the needs of the community. Sullivan said the service learning projects 
are an integral part of the high school's curriculum, and projects can last 
from one or two days to a full semester. </p> 
<p>&quot;We're trying to teach them to be proactive citizens and often they 
haven't had exposure to that,&quot; Sullivan said.</p> 
<p>Parker said she hopes to create a long term partnership between the three 
agencies, getting the students outdoors, while providing a combination of 
practical, educational and social experiences.</p> 
<p>&quot;It's interpretive and educational and how to be a good steward of the 
land,&quot; Parker said.</p> 
<p>Parker said winter will curtail most outdoor-oriented service projects, 
although she hopes to squeeze in a reseeding and fencing project on the 
recently-improved Dutton Ditch pipeline before the snow flies. Parker was 
enthusiastic about the undertaking which she said would tie in nicely with 
their science curriculum.</p> 
<p>&quot;Right now they're studying water, so Dutton Ditch is perfect,&quot; 
Parker said.</p> 
<p>During the most recent work on the Ute and Blanco campgrounds, Parker said 
although 29 students participated, she's well aware that not all the students 
will take something away, that some will see it simply as a chore, as a school 
project and little more. But at the same time, Parker said, for some students 
the experience taps into something deeper.</p> 
<p>&quot;Not all 29 kids will remember the experience, but one or two will 
take something away,&quot; Parker said.</p> 
<p>And that was proven to Parker after the first project in May.</p> 
<p>Parker said one student wrote an essay reflecting on the experience, and 
how it had changed his view of Forest Service staff and the value of 
campgrounds.</p> 
<p>She said before the project he had a negative attitude toward Forest 
Service personnel and the agency's regulations but that the work experienced 
changed those attitudes for the better.</p> 
<p>For Parker, if just one student comes away with a new way of looking at the 
Forest Service, the land and the outdoors, the project is well worth the 
undertaking.</p>

<p><b>Jicarilla delegation goes to Washington D.C. </b></p> 
<p><b>By John M. Motter</b></p> 
<p><b>SUN Columnist</b></p> 
<p>During 1873, while waiting for the government to designate a reservation 
for them, many of the Jicarilla were living near Abiquiu, especially members of 
the White Clan. A good percentage of the Red Clan remained near Cimarron. 
Various bands of Jicarilla were scattered in other places.</p> 
<p>The overall Jicarilla goal was to obtain a reservation, a place of safety 
and a place to make a living. Unfortunately, the various bands of Jicarilla did 
not agree on a reservation location. The prevailing government opinion at that 
time was to place the Jicarilla on a reservation in Colorado on the upper 
reaches of the San Juan River. Another idea crowding its way to the forefront 
was a plan to move the Jicarilla onto the Mescalero Apache Reservation in 
southern New Mexico, a move the Jicarilla did not sanction.</p> 
<p>Nothing but talk took place 1874 and 1875. By March of 1878 the decision 
had been made to move the Jicarilla to Mescalero. The commander of the military 
district was ordered to enforce the removal and Indian Agent Russell was 
ordered to provide the Jicarilla with provisions for the journey. Consequently, 
the Cimarron and Abiquiu Agencies were closed.</p> 
<p>Initially, only Jicarilla leader San Pablo and his band were found. They 
agreed to go to Mescalero and sent out runners with orders to locate the other 
Jicarilla bands. Wagons loaded with supplies pulled out, cattle were driven by 
men and boys, and it seemed the task would soon be accomplished.</p> 
<p>Those hopes evaporated when San Pablo's people slipped away to join their 
relatives near Abiquiu. Only San Pablo and 32 of his people arrived at 
Mescalero. San Pablo explained that for some unknown reason his people had 
deserted him on the road. He asked for permission to look for them, but was 
denied permission. Later, he slipped away and returned north.</p> 
<p>Removal from Abiquiu was not attempted until August 1878 after the Southern 
Utes had been relocated to the Los Pi&ntilde;os Agency in Colorado. On August 
18, Government Inspector Watkins called a council of the Jicarilla who 
assembled immediately. The Jicarilla refused to go, using the excuse of the 
Lincoln County War, the famous or infamous conflagration involving Billy the 
Kid. A frustrated Watkins recommended removal of the Jicarilla to Oklahoma 
Territory, but nothing came of this suggestion.</p> 
<p>Because the Jicarilla were all at the temporary agency at Tierra Amarilla 
attending Watkins's council, an attempt was made to keep them there by making 
that location the source of their rations. The attempt failed when many 
Jicarilla returned to Cimarron. Troops were requested to hold the Jicarilla at 
Tierra Amarilla, but were not sent. An agency police force made up of tribal 
members was organized but could not contain the departing Jicarilla. The agency 
police resigned en masse in May of 1879, unwilling to work against their 
relatives. The Cimarron Jicarilla spent the summer of 1879 back in their own 
territory.</p> 
<p>In Abiquiu the other Jicarilla remained peaceful. Mundo and his son Huerito 
visited Ouray on the Ute Reservation to seek his advice. Ouray advised them to 
seek a conference with the President of the United States. When he returned 
home, Mundo conferred with tribal elders, and then asked Agent Thomas to seek 
the desired presidential conference. Permission was granted Dec. 13, 1879, and 
three months later a delegation of leaders visited Washington D.C.</p> 
<p>Those leaders were San Pablo, Juan Juli-n, Santiago Largo, Huerito Mundo, 
and August&iacute;n Vigil. They met with Acting Commissioner E.J. Brooks to 
discuss the location of a reservation. The outcome was an apparent victory for 
the Jicarilla. Brooks appointed E.B. Townsend to select land for the tribe.</p> 
<p>By August of 1880, Townsend had examined some land that the Jicarilla 
wanted west of Tierra Amarilla in northern New Mexico. He described the place 
as one of the best that could be found in the territory with fine land along 
the Navajo River suitable for agriculture. He found only four or five settlers 
on these lands. The settlers had erected some buildings he thought would be 
suitable for agency headquarters. Townsend advised the government to buy out 
the settlers.</p>

<p></p> <b>Pagosa Sky Watch</b> 
<p></p> 
<p><b>Look for meteors between midnight and dawn </b></p> 
<p><b>By James Robinson</b></p> 
<p><b>Staff Writer</b></p> 
<p>The following sun and moon data is provided by the United States Naval 
Observatory.</p> 
<p>Sunrise: 7:20 a.m.</p> 
<p>Sunset: 6:26 p.m.</p> 
<p>Moonrise: 4:57 a.m</p> 
<p>Moonset: 5:17 p.m.</p> 
<p>Moon phase: The moon is waning crescent with 5 percent of the visible disk 
illuminated - New Moon Oct. 21, 11:15 p.m. Mountain Daylight Time.</p> 
<p>With the moon gradually waning and a new moon approaching, the night sky is 
shaping up to provide prime viewing conditions for two celestial happenings - 
the passage of Comet SWAN and the annual Orionid meteor shower.</p> 
<p>Unfortunately, viewing conditions aren't linked solely to the interference 
of moonlight, and if the current weather pattern persists, the Orionids and 
Comet SWAN will pass virtually unnoticed.</p> 
<p>If the clouds ultimately part, skywatchers should keep a keen watch on the 
northwestern sky as night falls in the area just below and slightly to the west 
of Alkaid - the terminal star in the handle of the Big Dipper.</p> 
<p>According to Sky and Telescope Magazine, the comet is travelling on its 
predicted trajectory, and this week, skywatchers can use two stars - beta and 
gamma Bo&ouml;tis, part of the kite shaped constellation Bo&ouml;tes - to help 
them locate the whizzing clod of galactic slush.</p> 
<p>Observations undertaken last week at night fall and under excellent dark 
sky conditions, indicated the comet was visible with the naked eye and 
binoculars. The comet appeared as a bluish-green, slightly hazy point of light.
</p> 
<p>At this point in its journey, Comet SWAN has already made its pass around 
the sun and is hurling out of our solar system. It will make its closest brush 
with Earth toward the end of October, and by Halloween, stargazers can see 
Comet SWAN passing near M13, the great globular cluster in the constellation 
Hercules. By Thanksgiving, look for Comet SWAN near Altair in the constellation 
Aquila, although the comet will grow dimmer as it journeys to the outer reaches 
of our solar system and beyond.</p> 
<p>Astronomers say Comet SWAN is traveling on a hyperbolic orbit, meaning it 
is not gravitationally bound to the sun. Astronomers once speculated hyperbolic 
comets may have originated in another solar system and eventually wandered into 
our solar system, but studies of the orbital paths of other hyperbolic comets 
indicate otherwise. In fact, is it now widely accepted that hyperbolic comments 
originated in our solar system and orbited the sun, but a close brush with the 
gravitational field of a massive planet, such as Jupiter, Uranus, Saturn or 
Neptune, may have been enough to jerk the comet from its gravitational bond 
with the sun, thus flinging it into a wild, new hyperbolic orbit, sending it on 
a trajectory far beyond our solar system.</p> 
<p>Where Comet SWAN's journey will end is anybody's guess, and it is likely 
Earth-based stargazers will not witness its passage again.</p> 
<p>Although viewing Comet SWAN may be a once in lifetime opportunity, the 
Orionid meteor shower is an annual occurrence and astronomers anticipate the 
shower will peak this year on Oct. 20 and 21. The best time to look for meteors 
is between midnight and dawn - expect to see about 20 meteors per hour or one 
every few minutes.</p> 
<p>With no moonlight to interfere, and although relatively sparse compared to 
the Perseids or Geminids, the Orionids could put on a stunning show.</p> 
<p>In addition to counting meteors in the hours before dawn, you can take 
advantage of the dark sky conditions to locate a number of our night sky's most 
prominent stars.</p> 
<p>Looking to the south-southwest, start by locating Orion and the three stars 
in the hunter's belt. Orion will be found slightly less than midway between the 
horizon and a position directly over head. Orion also marks the point of 
origin, or radiant, of the Orionid meteor show - hence the shower's name.</p> 
<p>Using the belt stars as a pointer, look to the right and you'll notice the 
belt stars direct the viewer to a bright, reddish-orange star. This is 
Aldebaran, the alpha star in the constellation Taurus, marking the eye of the 
celestial bull. </p> 
<p>Going back to Orion's belt stars and following them to the left and then 
dropping slightly downward, stargazers will find Sirius, the brightest star in 
our night sky.</p> 
<p>And lastly, for those at more northern latitudes, be on the alert for a 
weekend of possibly spectacular auroras.</p> 
<p>According to spaceweather.com, an X-ray image from the National Oceanic 
&amp; Atmospheric Administration's GOES-13 satellite indicates a gaping black 
hole on the sun. </p> 
<p>Astronomers call this black spot a coronal hole.</p> 
<p>A coronal hole is a place where the sun's magnetic field opens, allowing 
the sun's magnetic field to extend indefinitely into space. Astronomers call 
this solar wind, and they estimate the stream of charged particles rushing from 
the coronal hole should reach Earth Oct. 20 possibly sparking a geomagnetic 
storm and stunning auroras.</p>

<p><b>Break possible in wet weather trend </b></p> 
<p><b>By Chuck McGuire</b></p> 
<p><b>Staff Writer</b></p> 
<p>Rain, rain, rain, will it ever end? </p> 
<p>The answer may be a resounding yes, although it snowed lightly for a time, 
yesterday afternoon.</p> 
<p>According to the National Weather Service and AccuWeather.com, Pagosa 
Springs and surrounding areas have seen the last of torrential rains for 
awhile. While yesterday's online satellite image showed a rather large 
disturbance in the northwest, which appeared to be heading directly for us, 
meteorologists suggest it will avoid Colorado.</p> 
<p>We'll see. </p> 
<p>Meanwhile, the Pagosa Lakes area received another 1.71 inches of moisture 
over the past seven days. Incredibly, that brings the monthly total up to a 
whopping 4.23 inches since October 3. Between a rain and snow mix, the record 
is 7.8 inches, recorded in 1972.</p> 
<p>In spite of all the clouds and precipitation through the week, temperatures 
have stayed fairly mild. Daytime highs have averaged in the mid-50s, with last 
Friday's reading at 62 and Tuesday's at only 47. Low temperatures have hovered 
around the freezing mark, ranging between last Thursday's 27 and Sunday's 35.
</p> 
<p>Sustained winds were light and variable through the period, but gusts of up 
to 29 miles per hour were recorded on Tuesday. Occasional gusts between 12 and 
19 miles per hour were recorded through the week.</p> 
<p>The forecast for the next seven days calls for fair to partly cloudy skies, 
with no precipitation and seasonal temperatures. Daytime highs will range in 
the mid-50s and nighttime lows should dip into the mid-20s.</p> 
<p>At this point, it appears Halloween will be a clear and brisk evening, with 
a bright waxing moon (between First Quarter and Full) and hundreds of ghouls 
and goblins in the streets of Pagosa. Beware, as nighttime temperatures should 
fall well below freezing.</p>
