<p><b>Hot shot crews battle wildfire</b></p> 
<p><b>16 miles north</b></p> 
<p><b>By Tess Noel Baker</b></p> 
<p><b>Staff Writer</b></p> 
<p>A wildfire west of Pagosa Springs defied attempts to squelch it Tuesday, 
growing to about 50 acres. </p> 
<p>Bob Frye, a representative of the Pagosa Ranger District, said winds of 
25-30 miles per hour in the afternoon pushed the fire, near Trail Creek and 
Piedra Road, up into steep, rocky country, making it difficult to stop.</p> 
<p>Nearby, a second fire, this one about a quarter of an acre in size, also 
started. Both are between three-quarters of a mile and a mile west of Piedra 
Road where it crosses the river. In fact, Piedra Road from McManus Road to 
Kleckner Lane was closed Wednesday. Traffic was being routed up McManus.</p> 
<p>About 30 firefighters were on scene Tuesday. By the end of the day 
Wednesday, that number was expected to reach 70.</p> 
<p>Frye said Wednesday morning Hot Shot crews were en route from Pike National 
Forest and Rocky Mountain National Forest. Two helicopters were also on-scene 
with another on standby in Durango. An air tanker from Grand Junction made one 
drop Tuesday.</p> 
<p>Frye said lightning Sunday most likely started the fire. It smoldered 
silently until conditions were right and spread through grass up into Ponderosa 
and mixed-conifer fuels.</p> 
<p>&quot;Even with the moisture we've gotten, it's still dry out there,&quot; 
he said. &quot;The grass may be green, but the fuels remain dry.&quot;</p> 
<p>On a related note, the Archuleta County commissioners are holding a special 
meeting this afternoon in order to draft language that will likely require 
residents to notify county dispatchers when the residents plan to conduct 
&quot;open burns.&quot; </p> 
<p>It is also likely such language will recommend all county residents contact 
dispatch before initiating &quot;ditch fires&quot; and similar burns regardless 
of whether or not they live within the boundaries of the Pagosa Fire Protection 
or Los Pinos Fire Protection districts.</p> 
<p>The board indicated no fees or permits will be required for such burns, and 
stated the end result of today's meeting centering on &quot;prior 
notification&quot; will be included as an amendment to the county's pending 
fire ban ordinance and published in an upcoming issue of The SUN.</p> 
<p>In another action related to fire control, the board approved the purchase 
of three self-contained, foam-dispersal units at a cost of approximately $9,000 
each. </p> 
<p>The units, or tanks, will be loaded on county trucks and utilized as means 
of providing rapid, initial-attack suppression in the case of wildfire.</p>

<p><b>Young father drowns in Lake Pagosa</b></p> 
<p><b>By Tess Noel Baker</b></p> 
<p><b>Staff Writer</b></p> 
<p>A Pagosa man drowned May 28 in Lake Pagosa. He was apparently canoeing to 
visit a friend when the accident happened.</p> 
<p>Archuleta County Coroner Carl Macht said the body of Brian Kirsop, 25, of 
Pagosa Springs, was found in 6-8 feet of water May 29. His canoe was found 
floating about 100 yards away. An autopsy showed the cause of death was 
drowning.</p> 
<p>Sgt. Karn Macht, Upper San Juan Search and Rescue coordinator, said he 
responded to the scene about 11 p.m. May 28. Search and rescue members located 
Kirsop's canoe about 1:40 a.m. Meanwhile, deputies contacted family and friends 
in the hope of finding the husband and father alive and well.</p> 
<p>On the lake, several spotters used four boats and began to search the 
water. Since the lake is only about 16 feet deep at most, Macht said, spotters 
were able to see the bottom over a large portion of the search area.</p> 
<p>&quot;We were getting ready to send a dive crew in to look at the deeper 
portions when we found the body,&quot; he said.</p> 
<p>Karn Macht said searchers located Kirsop's body about 8 a.m. He was not 
wearing a life jacket.</p> 
<p>The Pagosa Fire Protection District aided in the search by providing a 
ladder truck with powerful lights to illuminate the water. Boats were on loan 
from a private citizen, Pagosa Area Water and Sanitation District and the 
Pagosa Lakes Property Owners Association.</p> 
<p>Kirsop is survived by his wife, Breanna and three sons, Kyle, Kaleb and 
Xander. Private funeral services were held Sunday.</p> 
<p>Two separate memorial funds have been set up to assist the family with 
expenses.</p> 
<p>One is at Wells Fargo Bank where contributions can be sent to Account No. 
9866512438.</p> 
<p>The second is at Vectra Bank with Account No. 4958259139.</p>

<p><b>New owners for The Pagosa Springs SUN</b></p> 
<p><b>By Karl Isberg</b></p> 
<p><b>Staff Writer</b></p> 
<p>Since its creation more than 94 years ago, The Pagosa Springs SUN has had 
several owners and publishers. </p> 
<p>For the last 50-plus years, the newspaper had two owners and publishers. 
David C. Mitchell took over as owner, publisher and editor of the newspaper in 
1981 and maintained it until his death in October 2002. Prior to that, Glen 
Edmonds owned and operated The SUN for 32 years.</p> 
<p>As of May 30, The SUN has its newest owners, and they are no strangers to 
the business. Terri and Todd House, longtime employees of the newspaper 
completed transactions making them the new owners of the newspaper. Terri House 
assumes duties as publisher of The SUN.</p> 
<p>The closing of the deal May 30 transferred ownership to the Houses and an 
as-yet unnamed corporation from the Mitchell family and their corporation, The 
Pagosa Springs SUN, Inc.</p> 
<p>Terri House came to work at The SUN one month after her graduation from 
Pagosa Springs High School in 1982, working part-time doing paste-up and layout.
</p> 
<p>In October 1982 she became the newspaper's classified advertising manager 
and shortly thereafter was made the manager of the composition room.</p> 
<p>Learning as she went, House took a position in advertising sales, during 
some of the roughest economic times in recent memory. She was promoted to 
advertising sales manager in 1988 and to general manager in 1997.</p> 
<p>Having mastered the business aspects of the operation, House was promoted 
to assistant publisher in 2001. </p> 
<p>Todd House has an equally lengthy history with The SUN, beginning work at 
the business in maintenance in 1984. He was promoted to the position of 
pressman and went to work in the newspaper's darkroom operation in September 
1985. Todd House has served as The SUN's production and purchasing manager 
since October 2002, and will continue in that capacity.</p> 
<p>&quot;There is no doubt I still have much to learn about running a 
community newspaper,&quot; said Terri House. &quot;The SUN will continue to be 
a newspaper that reflects Pagosa Springs - our community. It has been a 
longtime goal of this newspaper to provide the most comprehensive, accurate 
news, while providing an effective advertising vehicle for our advertisers. In 
honor of David Mitchell's spirit, I intend to continue this tradition.&quot;</p>
<p>House indicated there are no changes planned in The SUN's staff or 
management following the change in ownership.</p>

<p><b>Breezy mix of sun and clouds forecast</b></p> 
<p><b>By Tom Carosello</b></p> 
<p><b>Staff Writer</b></p> 
<p>The late-May pattern of afternoon showers gave way to clear skies and brief 
intervals of gusty winds across Pagosa Country in the first days of June, a 
trend forecasters are predicting will continue through the weekend.</p> 
<p>Despite the talk of snow across the northern half of the state, the latest 
indications are the Canadian cold front that may produce flurries in Denver 
will not sag far enough south to affect the San Juan Mountains.</p> 
<p>&quot;There's really not much of a chance the Four Corners area will see 
any precipitation, let alone snow,&quot; said Paul Frisbie, a forecaster with 
the National Weather Service office in Grand Junction.</p> 
<p>&quot;The chances are really low for any significant precipitation, maybe 
10 or 20 percent at the most,&quot; said Frisbie, &quot;An isolated shower and 
breezy conditions would be the most I think you could expect in the next few 
days.&quot;</p> 
<p>According to Frisbie, morning sun will give way to partly cloudy skies by 
this afternoon. Southwest winds in the 15-25 mile per hour range are expected, 
along with highs in the 70s and lows in the mid-30s.</p> 
<p>Friday's forecast calls for partly cloudy skies, highs stretching into the 
mid-70s and nighttime lows in the 30s.</p> 
<p>Saturday and Sunday should be dominated my mostly sunny skies, light 
westerly winds, highs in the upper 60s to low 70s and lows in the 30s.</p> 
<p>A slight warming trend is expected for Monday and Tuesday; highs should 
range in the upper 70s to mid-80s while lows should fall into the 40s.</p> 
<p>The forecast for Wednesday includes a 20-percent chance for afternoon 
showers across higher elevations, highs in the low 80s and lows around 40.</p> 
<p>The Pagosa Ranger District rates the current area fire danger as 
&quot;moderate.&quot; Conditions are subject to change rapidly this time of 
year; for updates, call the district office at 264-2268.</p> 
<p>The National Allergy Bureau rates area pollen counts as &quot;moderate to 
low&quot; and indicates the dominant pollens are currently oak, grass, cedar 
and juniper.</p> 
<p>Water temperature in Navajo Reservoir is reportedly in the 60s, and the 
lake's surface level is currently listed at an elevation of 6,017 feet and 
rising. The boat ramp at Navajo State Park is open.</p> 
<p>San Juan River flow peaked at over 2,600 feet per second during the past 
week, and exceeded the historical median flow of roughly 1,500 cubic feet per 
second for seven consecutive days.</p>

<p>By Dan Janowsky</p> 
<p>Special to The SUN</p> 
<p>For the eleventh year, high school and junior high wrestlers in Pagosa 
Springs participated in a training camp conducted by wrestling great Terry 
Brands.</p> 
<p>Brands is one of the best known names in the sport of amateur wrestling, 
having won numerous national titles as well as two world championships and an 
Olympic bronze medal. </p> 
<p>Recently retired from competition, Brands is now one of the country's most 
highly sought clinicians and now works as head wrestling coach at University of 
Tennessee at Chattanooga.</p> 
<p>Adding to the athletic experience was location of the camp in facilities 
provided by Matt Poma and the Poma Ranch. Mats were placed outside on the 
ground next to Weminuche River at the ranch.</p> 
<p>Athletes brought tents and sleeping bags, the meals were provided and the 
local participants received plenty of fresh air, recreation and one-on-one 
instruction last weekend from one of the world's elite athletes and coaches.</p>
<p>Coach Brands will return the first weekend in August to conduct another 
training camp.</p>

<p><b>Outfield advertising approved for Pirate baseball operation</b></p> 
<p><b>By Richard Walter</b></p> 
<p><b>Staff Writer</b></p> 
<p>With one advertiser already signed up, the Pagosa Springs High School 
baseball program is about to join most of the others in the region.</p> 
<p>The plan is for outfield fence advertising, a continuing source of revenue 
for sports programs, Bayfield being the most notable example in the area.</p> 
<p>Coach Tony Scarpa said the team has received permission form the school to 
conduct the advertising campaign.</p> 
<p>Signs, each 4 by 8 feet, will be up from March through August each year and 
will be renewable.</p> 
<p>Cost will be $300 each and Scarpa said there is room for 50 to 60 if all 
the outfield fence area is used. </p> 
<p>Since the program is a first for the Pagosa Springs team, members hope to 
get reservations in early so the signs can be ordered and ready for display for 
the next baseball season.</p> 
<p>All proceeds will go to the high school baseball fund with expenses of the 
program, including uniforms, equipment and field maintenance and improvement as 
targets for spending.</p> 
<p>The Pirate baseball team was co-champion of the Intermountain League this 
season and advanced to state competition, losing in extra innings to Eaton, the 
eventual state champion.</p>

35.30, taking second on balance beam with 9.15, fourth on bars at 8.4; and 
tying for third in vault with 9.0.</p> 
<p>Stretton placed sixth in all-around and tied for fourth on the balance beam.
</p> 
<p>There were 29 participants representing four teams in the Division.</p> 
<p>Team score is dependent on the top three scorers on each team and it girls 
to do well to win the team title.</p> 
<p>Competing at the optional B level were Raesha Ray and Shelby Stretton.</p> 
<p>Stretton tied for third in the all- around and Ray placed fifth among the 
seven competitors in Optional B.</p>

<p><b>Mary Muirhead</b></p> 
<p>Mary Walquist Muirhead passed on May 25, 2003. She was 80 years old. Born 
May 16, 1923, in Burlingame, Kan., to Sara and Theodore Walquist, she was 
reared on a farm along with a brother, Theodore Jr., and three sisters, 
Dorthea, Oma Ruth and Patricia.</p> 
<p>After high school graduation she moved to Illinois where she met and later 
married Bruce Muirhead of the Plato Center clan. Bruce was serving in WW II 
when they married and they shared many happy experiences and sadness of 
absences due to military assignments.</p> 
<p>The couple had three children, Barry of Salt Lake City and Crested Butte, 
Joanne of Crested Butte and George of Pagosa Springs. Others surviving are 
their spouses, Bruce, her three sisters, nine grandchildren and two 
great-grandsons.</p> 
<p>Mary loved to travel and, as a travel agent, had the opportunity to do so, 
sometimes with her husband and sometimes with other travel agents. She helped 
Bruce build an airplane which allowed for more travel and exciting experiences.
</p> 
<p>Mary was a very loving wife, mother, sister and grandmother. An active 
Methodist all her life, she taught Sunday School, sang in the choir and enjoyed 
her many friends there. She also enjoyed calling on shut-ins and leaving them 
cheered. As an ambitious quilter, she made quilts for her home and also for 
each of her grandchildren, which they cherish.</p> 
<p>The Muirheads lived in Boulder for 28 years and when they retired in 1980, 
they chose Pagosa Springs to live out their lives. They were married almost 60 
years.</p> 
<p>Mary will be sorely missed by all who knew her. A memorial service is 
planned June 10 at 1 p.m. in Community United Methodist Church in Pagosa 
Springs. Donations in lieu of flowers may be made to the Alzheimer's 
Association.</p>

<p><b>Asphalt foe's outburst spurs call for deputy assist at planning 
commission hearing</b></p> 
<p><b>By Tom Carosello</b></p> 
<p><b>Staff Writer</b></p> 
<p>Tensions ran high during a public hearing conducted at the May 28 meeting 
of the Upper San Juan Regional Planning Commission - an event punctuated by an 
outburst that sparked a temporary request for assistance from the Archuleta 
County Sheriff's Department.</p> 
<p>The hearing focused on an appeal of the hours of operation set forth as 
part of county planning staff's May 1 approval of a limited impact use 
application for a temporary asphalt plant operation on Mask Ranch property, 
northwest of the Holiday Acres subdivision off County Road 119.</p> 
<p>The conditions of approval for that application (submitted by A&amp;S 
Construction Company) included limiting the plant's hours of operation from 8 
a.m.-5 p.m. Monday-Friday while prohibiting operations Saturdays and holidays.
</p> 
<p>Asphalt produced at the plant, which is set to begin operation in late 
July, will be used in the repaving of portions of U.S. 84, a project sponsored 
by the Colorado Department of Transportation.</p> 
<p>Representing A&amp;S at Wednesday night's hearing, John Ary explained to 
the commission that the decision to seek extended hours of operation relates to 
timeliness.</p> 
<p>If permitted to operate from at least 7 a.m.-6 p.m. five days per week, 
said Ary, &quot;We feel we can complete the project this summer.&quot;</p> 
<p>But on any given day, &quot;Once we're shut down, we're shut down,&quot; 
added Ary, indicating weather delays and equipment breakdowns could delay the 
project's completion until next spring if his company were held to shorter work 
hours.</p> 
<p>Ary then supplied the commission with letters from CDOT expressing similar 
concerns. &quot;Basically they're asking for this, putting in their two cents 
worth for this to be approved,&quot; said Ary.</p> 
<p>Acknowledging the recent public protest from area residents concerning the 
possibility of air and water pollution associated with the plant, Ary informed 
the board he is aware of the potential hazards.</p> 
<p>&quot;We have plenty of information on hand concerning what our plant is 
and does,&quot; concluded Ary, adding that A&amp;S has secured all the 
necessary permits and will be required to comply with all applicable state and 
federal regulations regarding emissions.</p> 
<p>Before requesting public opinion, Bob Huff, board chairman, asked for 
comments from his fellow planning commissioners.</p> 
<p>&quot;My concern is with the people,&quot; said Commissioner Betty Shahan, 
I really would like it, for these people, for the plant to be moved.&quot;</p> 
<p>Huff responded by citing the fact that relocation was not within the scope 
of the appeal, and therefore not a consideration to be addressed by the 
commission.</p> 
<p>&quot;There's really only one issue here, the hours of operation,&quot; 
said Huff, &quot;We don't have the capability to say (A&amp;S) shall move ... 
that's not our option.&quot;</p> 
<p>Then, before taking public comment, &quot;Please keep it to the 
point,&quot; said Huff, reiterating that any comments should be related only to 
the hours of operation.</p> 
<p>Residents of Holiday Acres comprised the majority of those who spoke, and 
most called for the commission to consider what one resident referred to as 
&quot;the strictest hours possible.&quot;</p> 
<p>Another resident, Walter Green, chose to address issues not related to 
hours of operation and voiced displeasure with the plant's approval in general.
</p> 
<p>&quot;The (limited impact use) application is not worth anything if you're 
not going to enforce it,&quot; said Green at the onset of what would prove to 
be an increasingly-animated display of frustration before the board.</p> 
<p>&quot;This is outside the scope of discussion,&quot; warned Mary Weiss, 
county attorney.</p> 
<p>But Green continued. &quot;Why don't we abide by our own regulations?&quot; 
shouted Green as he proceeded to toss selected sections of the county land use 
regulations onto the desks of the commissioners before slamming the remainder 
of the documents to the courthouse floor.</p> 
<p>The outburst prompted Huff to call for order several times before asking, 
&quot;Can we get some help here?&quot;</p> 
<p>&quot;There's a panic button right underneath the desk,&quot; replied 
Weiss, as Julie Rodriguez, county building director, headed down the hall 
toward the sheriff's office.</p> 
<p>&quot;I'm not worried about the sheriff,&quot; answered Green, &quot;If I'm 
out of order, tell me to sit down.&quot;</p> 
<p>&quot;You are out of order, please sit down,&quot; replied Huff.</p> 
<p>Green obliged, and no participation from the sheriff's office was required 
as the hearing continued without further incident.</p> 
<p>However, not everyone who spoke was opposed to an extension of operating 
hours. Some supported the idea of expanding the hours in order to get the 
project over as soon as possible.</p> 
<p>&quot;We have to look at the good of the county, not just a few,&quot; said 
Gene Crabtree, &quot;I'm sure that will be unpopular ... but let's get this 
project done so we can get the tourists back and make some money.&quot;</p> 
<p>Near the end of the hearing, the planning commission echoed such sentiments.
</p> 
<p>&quot;Get in, get it done, and there will be less of an impact,&quot; said 
Commissioner Bob Walkinshaw.</p> 
<p>Commissioner Lynn Constan agreed; &quot;I feel it's more important to get 
the work done now rather than risk going into next summer.&quot;</p> 
<p>&quot;Nobody likes putting up with a highway project,&quot; said Huff, 
&quot;But we all want the highway ... that's the pinch we're in.&quot;</p> 
<p>After further discussion, the commission unanimously carried a motion 
(recommendation to the board of county commissioners) to extend the plant's 
hours of operation to 7 a.m.-6 p.m. Monday-Friday.</p>

<p><b>Talks underway for town and county project to improve two local roads</b>
</p> 
<p><b>By Tess Noel Baker</b></p> 
<p><b>Staff Writer</b></p> 
<p>With construction season in full swing, it might seem as if orange is 
everywhere.</p> 
<p>It's on Wolf Creek, stretches down Hot Springs Boulevard, is on the north 
side of the road headed east of town and lines the way down U.S. 84.</p> 
<p>And it's not over yet.</p> 
<p>The town and county are still negotiating an intergovernmental agreement to 
reconstruct a portion of Village Drive and Pinon Causeway. The two roads, 
notable for their potholes, were used mainly for residential and hotel traffic 
until last summer when the intersection of Talisman Drive and U.S. 160 became 
right-turn only off Talisman.</p> 
<p>That improvement was made to prevent accidents at that intersection. Today, 
traffic is diverted down Village Drive and onto Pinon Causeway. A temporary 
traffic light at Pinon and U.S. 160 allows drivers to turn left onto the 
highway more safely.</p> 
<p>Improvements, however, are needed.</p> 
<p>At Tuesday's meeting of the Pagosa Springs Board of Trustees, members had 
the chance to view cost estimates for the improvement project to include 
milling the existing surface and adding four inches of new asphalt along 
Village Drive from Talisman to Pinon and continuing up Pinon to the lights at 
U.S. 160.</p> 
<p>When completed, Village Drive would have a 24-foot paved surface with a 
two-foot gravel shoulder. The paved portion of Pinon would be 32 feet wide with 
a two-foot gravel shoulder. According to Davis Engineering Service Inc. 
estimates, the cost of the project would be about $200,000 with the 
engineering, design, administration and contingency fees.</p> 
<p>Originally, plans were to bid the project in a package together with the 
county's project to pave South Pagosa Boulevard through to Meadows Drive. 
County Administrator Bill Steele said engineering estimates on the Meadows 
portion of that project are due this week. Advertisements for bids will follow, 
possibly sometime yet this month.</p> 
<p>As for the intergovernmental agreement with the town on Pinon Causeway and 
Village Drive, discussions continue, Steele said.</p> 
<p>&quot;We are still looking into the possibilities to insure it will fit 
into our plans for the summer construction season.&quot;</p> 
<p>In other business:</p> 
<p>- Trustees appointed Stan Holt to fill the vacancy on the board left open 
when Jeff Jones resigned in May. Jones moved outside the town boundaries making 
him ineligible to continue to serve as a trustee</p> 
<p>- Town Administrator Mark Garcia announced that vacancies in the police 
department and the building department have been filled. Scott Maxwell, of 
Page, Ariz., has been hired as the new police investigator. Maxwell has over 10 
years experience in law enforcement, including time spent with the Garfield 
County Sheriff's Department, the Eagle Police Department and the Parachute 
Police Department in Colorado. He starts June 19.</p> 
<p>Steve Koneman, of Pagosa Springs, has been tapped for the building 
inspector/code enforcement officer position. He was previously employed in the 
construction business and starts work June 9.</p> 
<p>- Garcia announced that town sales tax receipts are down 1.7 percent from 
this time in 2002.</p>

<p><b>County denies asphalt plant extended operating hours</b></p> 
<p><b>By Tom Carosello</b></p> 
<p><b>Staff Writer </b></p> 
<p>The Archuleta County board of commissioners was split in its decision this 
week to deny an appeal for extended hours of operation for an asphalt plant 
scheduled to begin operation in late July on Mask Ranch property south of town.
</p> 
<p>Commissioners Mamie Lynch and Bill Downey voted for the denial following 
the respective arguments of county planning staff and A&amp;S Construction 
Company, the firm that filed the appeal. Alden Ecker, board chairman, cast the 
dissenting vote.</p> 
<p>The denial goes against the May 28 decision reached by the Upper San Juan 
Regional Planning Commission, which recommended extending the plant's asphalt 
production hours from 8 a.m.-5 p.m. to 7 a.m.-6 p.m. in order to accelerate the 
completion of the U.S. 84 repaving project.</p> 
<p>However, Marcus Baker, associate county planner, explained to the board 
that planning staff has recommended denial of the appeal for extended hours 
since its inception, a point he reiterated Tuesday.</p> 
<p>Since the plant was approved as a limited impact use on the basis of it 
being an extension of an existing operation, &quot;We feel it is important to 
extend the hours (8-5) of the original conditional use permit (Mask Ranch 
gravel operation) to this application,&quot; said Baker.</p> 
<p>&quot;We want to keep it as limited impact use,&quot; continued Baker, 
adding that although parameters for operating hours are not specified in the 
county land use regulations, they are open to interpretation by staff and 
&quot;we interpreted 8 a.m.-5 p.m. as having a lesser impact&quot; than longer 
hours.</p> 
<p>Ecker acknowledged those sentiments, but cited two letters from the 
Colorado Department of Transportation indicating the repaving project could 
extend into next year if longer production hours were not granted.</p> 
<p>&quot;Personally, I would like to avoid that, for the residents of Holiday 
Acres and the citizens of Archuleta County,&quot; said Ecker.</p> 
<p>While both agreed that the project should be finished as soon as possible, 
Lynch and Downey were reluctant to change the hours, saying they felt the need 
&quot;to stick with the original conditions of the limited impact use 
permit.&quot;</p> 
<p>To that suggestion, Mary Weiss, county attorney, responded, &quot;It seems 
like you are not giving due consideration to the decision of the planning 
commission.&quot;</p> 
<p>Lynch disagreed. &quot;I have given it due consideration,&quot; said Lynch, 
&quot;Perhaps they didn't give due consideration to planning staff's 
recommendation.&quot;</p> 
<p>Ecker replied by stating that, in his opinion, the notion of expanding work 
hours during the summer is not unreasonable. &quot;To get (the project) done, I 
would have to be in favor of extending the hours.&quot;</p> 
<p>Representing A&amp;S, John Ary said that a denial for extended hours could 
result in a magnification of the controversy at hand.</p> 
<p>&quot;Clearly, there is going to be more impact if we stretch this 
out,&quot; said Ary, &quot;Extending the hours, you will have a minimal 
impact.&quot;</p> 
<p>Ary added that his company had agreed to abide by the 8-5 parameters with 
regard to hauling operations, and was requesting the extension specifically for 
asphalt production.</p> 
<p>But ultimately, said Ary, the weather will control the speed of the 
project, therefore the more hours granted, the better the likelihood the 
project is completed on time.</p> 
<p>Lynch was not swayed, however, and her motion for denial a short time later 
was seconded by Downey, who offered some final sentiments.</p> 
<p>&quot;I think I'm willing to take that risk,&quot; said Downey, referring 
to the possibility the U.S. 84 project may extend into next year while adding 
he feels the plant &quot;probably should have been considered as a conditional 
use from the start.&quot;</p> 
<p>In other business the board:</p> 
<p>- scheduled a work session regarding county land use regulations and 
limited impact use permits for 7 p.m., June 16</p> 
<p>- tabled consideration of adoption of a county employee salary survey and 
corresponding pay plan recommended by Lee &amp; Burgess Associates</p> 
<p>- approved the appointment of Michael C. Branch to the county use tax task 
force</p> 
<p>-&nbsp;approved a reduction in landfill dumping fees from $6 to $4 per 
cubic yard at the request of the Pagosa Area Water and Sanitation District in 
exchange for +/- 2,500 yards of biosolid fill material</p> 
<p>- scheduled a work session regarding the language and adoption of a 
proposed code of ethics resolution for 1:30 p.m., June 23</p> 
<p>- granted final approval of the Pagosa Area Trails Project while choosing 
to retain a 5-percent portion of the money due the contractor until such time 
the seeding and mulching phases of the project are completed.</p>

<p><b>County noise ordinance heads back to drawing board</b></p> 
<p><b>By Tom Carosello</b></p> 
<p><b>Staff Writer </b></p> 
<p>The Archuleta County board of commissioners postponed a decision to adopt a 
countywide noise ordinance Tuesday night, choosing instead to send the draft 
back to the drawing board for minor revisions.</p> 
<p>The board's decision to table any action on the ordinance followed a 7 p.m. 
public hearing in the courthouse meeting room.</p> 
<p>During the hearing, which garnered comment from roughly a dozen members of 
the public, several gray areas within the ordinance were brought to light.</p> 
<p>The most notable of those &quot;discrepancies&quot; concerns a statutory 
distinction between the maximum permissible noise levels for yard equipment 
(chain saws, lawn mowers, etc.) and off-highway vehicles.</p> 
<p>In short, section five of the ordinance states the maximum noise level for 
residential property is 55 decibels from &quot;7 a.m. to the next 7 p.m.&quot; 
and 50 decibels from &quot;7 p.m. to the next 7 a.m.&quot;</p> 
<p>However, &quot;It shall not be considered a noise disturbance if a person 
uses lawn mowers or other commonly accepted yard equipment ... which exceed the 
maximum noise levels set forth above ... limited to no more than one 
consecutive hour during the hours from 8 a.m. to 7 p.m.&quot;</p> 
<p>That language served as the focus of attention for the majority of the 
hearing as several in attendance voiced concerns that it conflicts with section 
eight in the ordinance, which outlines the maximum sound levels for off-highway 
vehicles.</p> 
<p>It reads that it is prohibited to operate such vehicles &quot;in such a 
manner that the sound level emitted&quot; exceeds 82 decibels where there 
exists a speed limit of 35 miles per hour or less, and 86 decibels in areas 
having a speed limit of more than 35 mph but less than 55 mph.</p> 
<p>Most who offered comment on those parameters felt the gap between the 
maximums for yard equipment and off-highway vehicles should be reduced.</p> 
<p>&quot;If those noise limits (for yard equipment) are considered annoying, 
why not apply the same to off-road vehicles?&quot; asked Karen Aspin.</p> 
<p>&quot;I'm picturing that moto-cross track in Aspen Springs where they get 
going 35 or 45 miles per hour,&quot; continued Aspin, questioning whether or 
not the county has the authority to limit such activities.</p> 
<p>Mary Weiss, county attorney, explained such limitations are not possible 
under the county's current land use regulations.</p> 
<p>&quot;If we had zoning, perhaps we could do that,&quot; replied Weiss, 
indicating that until zoning is a reality, for the most part the county must 
adhere to existing statutory guidelines.</p> 
<p>Weiss added that the state's rationale for setting higher permissible noise 
levels for off-highway vehicles is more than likely related to their 
&quot;inherently louder&quot; nature. </p> 
<p>Bill Steele, county administrator, supported that notion.</p> 
<p>&quot;It appears as though that is exactly the case,&quot; said Steele, 
explaining his check of industry standards seemed to indicate that current 
regulations take into account how the vehicles sound &quot;right off the 
showroom floor.&quot;</p> 
<p>In comparison to some other states, said Steele, which set such levels as 
high as 106 decibels, &quot;These numbers might be relatively reasonable.&quot;
</p> 
<p>Some on hand argued that the ordinance should be adopted &quot;as is.&quot; 
Then, said Fred Ebeling, changes could be made as necessary.</p> 
<p>&quot;Zoning could take care of it,&quot; added Ebeling, &quot;But it's 
impossible to draft regulations covering everything that comes down the 
pipe.&quot;</p> 
<p>Other options mentioned included the notion of setting time limits for 
&quot;dirt bike&quot; activities or restricting them to a common area designed 
for such.</p> 
<p>Near hearing's end the board acknowledged the document needs some 
additional brainstorming before being considered for adoption.</p> 
<p>&quot;We'll review this and see if we can come up with something that's 
closer to what you want,&quot; Alden Ecker, board chairman, told the crowd 
after roughly an hour and a half of commentary.</p> 
<p>&quot;I don't think we're going to get this resolved at this meeting,&quot; 
he said, &quot; because I'm fixing to call this meeting to a close real 
quick.&quot; Ecker indicated a workshop aimed at fine tuning the ordinance will 
be scheduled at the board's June 17 meeting, probably for a date in mid-July.
</p> 
<p>&quot;We've got our plate completely full right now,&quot; concluded Ecker.

<p><b>Guilty plea entered in dog attack case</b></p> 
<p><b>By Tess Noel Baker</b></p> 
<p><b>Staff Writer</b></p> 
<p>One of two people charged with ownership of a dangerous dog in the case of 
the attack on 9-year-old Garrett Carothers two days before Christmas has 
pleaded guilty to reduced charges.</p> 
<p>Sandra Schultz, mother of David Martinez, who owned the dogs, pleaded 
guilty May 29 to one count of ownership of a dangerous dog causing bodily 
injury, a Class 1 misdemeanor. She was originally charged with four counts of 
ownership of a dangerous dog.</p> 
<p>Sentencing in the case is set for July 24 at 1:30 p.m. in Archuleta County 
Court.</p> 
<p>A Class 1 misdemeanor carries a possible sentence of between three and 18 
months jail, a $500-$1,500 fine, or both.</p> 
<p>Martinez is scheduled for a jury trial July 28 in connection with the 
incident. A pretrial readiness hearing is scheduled June 16.</p> 
<p>Carothers was attacked by two dogs Dec. 23 while standing on a neighbor's 
porch in the Vista Subdivision. The dogs apparently dragged him into the street 
and continued to bite him until spotted by two men driving in the area.</p> 
<p>By the time the attack was over, Carothers had suffered bites over most of 
his body and severe lacerations to his head, ear and face.</p> 
<p>One of the two dogs suspected of the attack, a Pit Bull, was shot the day 
of the attack as it lunged at a sheriff's deputy.</p> 
<p>The other dog, a retriever-Rottweiler mix, was captured and kept under 
quarantine. It has since been euthanized, with Martinez's consent.</p> 
<p>A civil case is also pending.</p>

<p><b>Things to know about childhood asthma as spring pollens appear</b></p> 
<p>With spring in the air it is a good time to focus on asthma and ways life 
can be made easier for those with the illness, particularly children.</p> 
<p>Asthma affects more than 15 million people in the United States, leading to 
nearly half a million hospital stays each year.</p> 
<p>Now at epidemic proportions, of most concern is the growing number of 
children with asthma.</p> 
<p>Since 1980, the largest increase in asthma cases has been in children under 
the age of five. In fact, one third of all pediatric emergency room visits are 
the result of asthma attacks.</p> 
<p>&quot;I have seen a steady rise in asthma cases among children since I 
started working in the schools,&quot; said Yvonne Yousey, a pediatric nurse 
practitioner with University of Colorado Health Sciences Center School of 
Nursing.</p> 
<p>Yousey provides primary health care services to school-based health centers 
in association with The Children's Hospital in Denver.</p> 
<p>&quot;We don't know exactly why there is a continued rise in asthma cases 
among children, but we know that through proper treatment and management, the 
illness can be controlled with little to no effect on a child's 
lifestyle,&quot; she said.</p> 
<p>Asthma is a chronic lung disease that can be life threatening. It causes 
breathing problems that are called asthma attacks or episodes. Symptoms include 
coughing during exercise or while resting after exercise, having shortness of 
breath, a wheezing sound when breathing, or a feeling of tightness in the chest.
</p> 
<p>Any one of these symptoms alone or in combination may indicate asthma. 
These symptoms are clues of the onset of an attack.</p> 
<p>Typically, asthma symptoms are triggered by something that irritates the 
lungs. These triggers include viruses, allergies, gases and particles in the 
air, exercise and weather conditions. Identifying the trigger of an asthma 
attack may be difficult, but it is important in controlling the illness and 
resuming a normal lifestyle.</p> 
<p>&quot;There are easy steps that can be taken to control asthma,&quot; said 
Yousey. &quot;People shouldn't be afraid of using recommended medications. Not 
only do they control the illness, they prevent future, more serious lung 
problems.&quot;</p> 
<p>With children, the important thing is to keep them active and healthy said 
Yousey. With proper management, children with asthma can lead happy, normal 
lives.</p>

<p><b>Region's lynx kitten total now at eight</b></p> 
<p>Four more lynx kittens have been found with their mother by a Colorado 
Division of Wildlife tracking crew at a remote, high-elevation den in 
southwestern Colorado, bringing the total number of lynx kittens to eight this 
spring.</p> 
<p>Three lynx have now given birth within the core area of southwestern 
Colorado: a British Columbia female released in 2000 was found with two kittens 
May 21 and a second female from British Columbia was found with two kittens May 
26.</p> 
<p>&quot;We found the lynx Saturday at about 11,000 feet in a den under a very 
large downed log that sheltered the kittens from rain and snow,&quot; said 
Tanya Shenk, the division's lead lynx researcher. They were only a few days old 
and appeared to be in good health when briefly examined by Shenk.</p> 
<p>For good measure, Shenk also noted two snowshoe hares - the lynx favorite 
prey - as she and the crew approached the den.</p> 
<p>The mother, a Yukon lynx released in 2000, apparently mated with a Yukon 
male from the 2000 release based on radio signals that allow the division to 
track their movements. The same pair may have bred last year based on radio 
tracking, but no young were found. This time, three males and one female kitten 
are the result.</p> 
<p>The division has released 129 lynx, 41 in 1999, 55 in 2000 and 33 this 
spring. The division hopes to release another 50 lynx in 2004 and 50 more in 
2005. Fifteen lynx will then be released in both 2006 and 2007.</p> 
<p>Shenk's crew is currently tracking 63 lynx. Another 45 are confirmed dead 
with human-caused mortality from gunshots and vehicle collisions the biggest 
cause of death. The status of the rest is unknown, though at least two have 
slipped their radio collars and the batteries have run down on the collars of 
others.</p> 
<p>The first pair of lynx kittens found two weeks ago was in a den beneath the 
trunk of an Englemann spruce on a steep mountainside at 10,600. Both the mother 
from British Columbia and the father from Yukon Territory were released April 
2, 2000.</p> 
<p>Snowshoe hares, the primary diet of lynx in winter, are common in the areas 
where the lynx were found. </p> 
<p>Division biologists hope there will be more births in 2003. This spring, 
radio signals from collars indicated that nine pairs of lynx were together 
during breeding season, offering hope that more mothers may be about to give 
birth. </p> 
<p>&quot;For some of the lynx, all of the factors necessary for successful 
reproduction have come together,&quot; Shenk said. She said the factors include 
having a female and male in the same area for one to two years and having 
sufficient prey so they're in good condition.</p> 
<p>&quot;What we have learned is that for all these factors to come to 
fruition takes a number of years,&quot; Shenk explained. But she pointed out 
that based on monitoring information the division has collected, not all 
females have established stable territories while others are have chosen areas 
where there are no males.</p> 
<p>&quot;That's why augmentation (bringing in more lynx) is necessary to 
increase densities so that all the females have the opportunity to breed,&quot; 
she said.</p> 
<p>The lynx program has been paid for primarily with Colorado Lottery money 
through the voter-approved Great Outdoors Colorado program and the division's 
nongame and endangered species checkoff on the Colorado income tax form.</p> 
<p>But additional funding is necessary to keep the program operating and the 
Colorado Wildlife Heritage Foundation is working to raise money to support 
reintroduction. To learn more about helping lynx recovery in Colorado, call the 
Heritage Foundation at (303) 291-7238.</p>

<p><b>Health reality</b></p> 
<p>Dear Editor:</p> 
<p>In response to the three questions posed by director Tillerson in her May 
29 letter:</p> 
<p>The short response:</p> 
<p>1. No</p> 
<p>2. Yes</p> 
<p>3. No</p> 
<p>The longer response:</p> 
<p>Pagosans have historically held unrealistic expectations of the local 
health care &quot;system.&quot;</p> 
<p>Newcomers and old-timers alike need to be educated and re-educated to the 
realities of Pagosa's system given the current funding model.</p> 
<p>I think Pagosa's medical services have historically exceeded what one 
should expect for a community of this size.</p> 
<p>Since 1976, I and my wife, Sue, have been volunteers, employees, and 
participants in Pagosa's medical community.</p> 
<p>I was one of the first group of volunteer EMTs, and director of public 
safety for the Pagosa Lakes community. Sue was clinic R.N. for the Dr. Mary 
Fisher Medical Clinic, and in the early '80s the Archuleta County Public Health 
Nurse. We lobbied for the creation of the current statutory district.</p> 
<p>Our children were born in Durango because inpatient OB services were not 
available in Pagosa Springs.</p> 
<p>We accepted the risks of this reality when we chose to nest here. We did 
not blame the medical community, county officials, or Dr. Mary Fisher directors 
for any perceived inadequacies. We did not believe the system was inadequate. 
Our expectations were based on reality - something Archuleta County medical 
service consumers need to understand, soon.</p> 
<p>Our second child was born prematurely in 1979, and subsequently died at 
Children's Hospital in Denver after being flown there from Durango. Had we 
lived near Children's Hospital (or the Mayo Clinic), her chances of survival 
would have dramatically increased.</p> 
<p>Bottom line: If I am accustomed to, and require the services offered by the 
Mayo Clinic, I should consider looking for real estate in Rochester, Scottsdale 
or Jacksonville - not Pagosa Springs.</p> 
<p>Health care in Pagosa is available via private enterprise and public 
funding. The common denominator is economic viability. As a community, we need 
to ask ourselves: What can we reasonably expect for our dollars, and/or how 
many additional dollars are we willing to spend to raise the bar? We can 
babble, drone, criticize, throw down gauntlets, and take sides over silly, 
egotistical personality issues, but until the above questions are answered it 
is all a ludicrous exercise in immature muscle flexing.</p> 
<p>I am interested in efficiency within the current economic mode. Dreams, 
hopes, wishes and desires are important, but absent educating the community as 
to the attendant costs for different options, they are merely flights of 
fantasy.</p> 
<p>I encourage the board and new committee of volunteers and professionals to 
be brutally honest and stop pandering to the whiny nonsense of those who prefer 
to live in Fantasyland. I'm sure there are those who'd be unhappy living there 
as well.</p> 
<p>Andrew (Andy) Donlon</p> 
<p>P.S. For the record, and no doubt against the grain of my former emergency 
medical peers, I support Dee Jackson for what she represents. I've never met 
her, but have discounted the street rumors to date.</p> 
<p><b>Tennis ignored</b></p> 
<p>Dear Editor:</p> 
<p>I spoke with someone at the &quot;city&quot; of Pagosa Springs the other 
day about the 16-acre sports complex to be built next to the high school. He 
said the completed facility is still three to four years away.</p> 
<p>Specifically, I asked why, with 16 acres available, no tennis courts were 
planned, but a skateboard facility was. I was told it wasn't in the budget, and 
their survey from 1999 indicated that no tennis courts were wanted or needed.
</p> 
<p>My concern is that everyone, including kids who want to learn, should have 
access to this great sport on public courts, of some sort for free.</p> 
<p>Yes, they tell us to go play on the Fairfield courts, but those courts have 
just been resurfaced and the powers that be there decided to pass the cost 
along to the users: it now costs $15 per person per hour and a half for 
nonmembers to play there - if sponsored by a member. If you'd rather be a 
member the annual membership cost is $145 per person.</p> 
<p>That's the only game in town for tennis, folks, and there is nothing else 
on the horizon. Many towns our size have a least one tennis court. Durango, not 
a whole lot larger, has at least four different places to go that have courts 
for free.</p> 
<p>So, the town is using a survey that's four years old, and nothing will be 
will be ready for use for four years or so ... gee, I wonder if the composition 
of the community or their opinions about an issue of this sort might not vary 
over eight years?</p> 
<p>I'm sure demographics don't indicate a large skateboarding faction in this 
town - and it tends to be a 'fad' kind of sport, falling in and out of favor 
over periods of many years. In other words, by the time the skateboard facility 
is built, it might not get much use, despite being right next to the high 
school.</p> 
<p>If nothing else, having no public tennis courts is simply backward.</p> 
<p>Why not join other forward-thinking towns of our size and put one in? I 
simply cannot believe that with 16 acres to work with there is no space for at 
least one court without even altering the rest of the plan much - and still 
keeping the skateboarding, if so desired.</p>

<p><b>Health opportunity</b></p> 
<p>Dear Editor:</p> 
<p>With the influx of young families moving into our area over the past few 
years, there is a real need to expand our health care services to include these 
young families and middle-aged folks. Many of them travel to Durango for their 
health care.</p> 
<p>The Upper San Juan Health Service District has a unique opportunity to meet 
these needs locally as the current clinic staff moves into private practice. 
The Dr. Mary Fisher Medical Center facility was constructed with the intent to 
provide up-to-date routine health care to all ages, both local and tourists, 
with physician emergency care access through the adjoining urgent care area.</p>
<p>Expanding health care services could include:</p> 
<p>1. Recruiting a family practice physician with up-to-date training in the 
health care needs specific to infants and children, adolescents, and women as 
well as general medicine.</p> 
<p>2. Recruiting a full time family practice physician with up-to-date 
training in emergency management to serve as physician advisor to EMS and staff 
the Urgent Care Center on weekends.</p> 
<p>3. An Urgent Care Center open weekends to both locals and tourists, 
providing walk-in emergency care and ambulance services with physician 
availability after hours.</p> 
<p>4. Lab availability 24/7 for routine tests with referrals to Mercy Same Day 
Care Center for more comprehensive studies when indicated.</p> 
<p>5. Continuing to provide clinic space for visiting specialists from Durango.
</p> 
<p>It has been suggested to turn the Mary Fisher Center into a diagnostic 
center; however, it has been noted that this would be something in the future 
as the current population could not support this expense. Mercy Hospital has a 
well-equipped diagnostic center with experienced technicians. We are fortunate 
to have them so close and soon they will be even closer once the new hospital 
is constructed.</p> 
<p>We need to hear from you, our public, if you believe these unmet needs are 
important to you, your family, and your guests. Please e-mail the Citizens 
Advisory Committee at pshealth@pagosa.net. We need your input.</p>

<p><b>VA benefit claims up in county\</b></p> 
<p><b>By Andy Fautheree</b></p> 
<p><b>SUN Columnist</b></p> 
<p>The Archuleta County Veterans Service Office has seen a substantial growth 
in VA benefits to veterans in this area, that directly affect the economy of 
the county.</p> 
<p>VA compensation and pension claims directly affect not only the well being 
of the veteran, but substantially affects the economy of Archuleta County.</p> 
<p>Benefits to veterans in Archuleta County increased by 11 percent in 2002, 
over the year 2001 to a total of $1,065,000. Compensation and pension money 
paid to veterans and/or surviving spouses and dependents was up 8.6 percent in 
the same period, for a total of $990,000.</p> 
<p>Official VA records indicate 1,273 veterans in Archuleta County were 
receiving some sort of VA benefit in 2002. This is a 36-percent increase over 
the previous year total of 817.</p> 
<p>The figures from 2000 to 2002 show a very large increase in veterans in 
Archuleta County receiving benefits. Veterans receiving compensation or pension 
money in that two-year span jumped 25 percent. Other comparisons of veteran 
population and other benefits paid to veterans during the two year period were 
not available for direct comparison in the VA official reports. </p> 
<p><b>Impact on county</b> </p> 
<p>Why does this impact Archuleta County so significantly? Consider that this 
is direct &quot;new&quot; money coming from federal sources outside of the 
state and county - money paid directly to veterans in our community. And, those 
payments are continuous, in most cases for the life of the veteran or the 
dependent. It isn't a one-time payment; it goes on year after year.</p> 
<p>This is very important considering the state is reducing some budget 
considerations toward veteran services. The new money and benefits coming into 
the county for veterans is from federal VA sources, not affected by state 
budget concerns. </p> 
<p>The veteran, of course, needs goods and services in Archuleta County. The 
money the veteran receives is circulated in the community, and the recipients 
pay taxes on the sales of those goods and services. Everyone in the community 
benefits directly or indirectly from growth in veterans benefit payments.</p> 
<p><b>Wise investment</b></p> 
<p>It becomes very evident it is a wise investment for the county to provide 
good veteran services. The veteran population of Archuleta County is growing 
rapidly as more and more retirees move to our beautiful area. Many of them are 
veterans.</p> 
<p>The more we invest in helping our veterans obtain VA benefits, the more it 
contributes to the economy of the county. It might be said providing veteran 
services actually pays for the cost of the services, and produces a substantial 
profit in revenue.</p> 
<p><b>Pride in services</b> </p> 
<p>Archuleta County can pride itself in being a leader among Colorado 
counties, especially rural counties, in having the vision to provide a high 
level of veterans services. It has built this service to our veterans through a 
history of strong support of the county Veterans Service Office by past and 
current county government officials.</p> 
<p>I would like to urge veterans and citizens of the community to express your 
appreciation to our county officials for continued support of veterans services 
next time you have the opportunity. It pays big dividends for all of us, right 
in our pocketbooks.</p> 
<p>For information on these and other veterans benefits please call or stop by 
the Veterans Service Office located on the lower floor of the county 
courthouse. The office number is 264-2304, the fax number is 264-5949, and 
e-mail is afautheree@archuletacounty.org. The office is open 8 a.m.-4 p.m. 
Monday through Thursday, Friday by appointment. Bring your DD Form 214 
(Discharge) for registration with the county, application for VA programs, and 
for filing in the VSO office.</p>

<p></p> <b>Chamber News</b> 
<p></p> 
<p><b>Newcomers add spice to 'Nunsense' cast</b></p> 
<p>Hallelujah! My favorite wacky nuns are returning this month, and I couldn't 
be more excited to catch up with their current antics.</p> 
<p>What in the world (or heavens) do you think Sisters Mary Regina, Mary 
Amnesia and Mary Hubert have been up to since we last laughed ourselves silly 
watching them in &quot;Nunsense?&quot;</p> 
<p>Newcomers Candy Flaming, Sister Robert Anne, and Amber Farnham, Sister Mary 
Leo, join the considerable talents of Mary McKeehan, Joan Hageman and Kathy 
Isberg, all of whom are reprising their roles, in &quot;Nunsense II, The Second 
Coming.&quot; </p> 
<p>The Little Sisters of the Hoboken Convent are sure to make us howl, hoot 
and holler again with their singing, dancing and general &quot;nunsense 
nonsense&quot; that made the first production in 1999 such a rip-roarin' 
success.</p> 
<p>Apparently, the Sisters are currently involved in a musical production and 
a party to thank all those whose contributions enabled the nuns to dispose of 
frozen corpses who were victims of a mysterious food-poisoning incident. 
There's nothing the least bit funny or ludicrous about this premise, of course. 
</p> 
<p>&quot;Nunsense II, The Second Coming&quot; is presented by the Pagosa 
Springs Music Boosters with Michael DeWinter directing, Lisa Hartley as musical 
director and Dale Morris handling the choreography. Shows will be presented at 
7:30 p.m. in the Pagosa Springs High School Auditorium on June 20, 21, 26, 27 
and 28 with a 3 p.m. matinee June 22.</p> 
<p>Reserved seating tickets may be purchased at The Plaid Pony and at 
Moonlight Books. Adult tickets are $12, seniors are $10, and children and 
students are $6. Please call 731-5262 for more information. Plan on attending 
two or three performances because once simply won't be enough.</p> 
<p><b>Hanging Baskets</b></p> 
<p>It's that time of year, folks, when beautiful hanging flower baskets are 
offered through the Chamber with a guarantee of delivery by a real, live board 
director or staff person. How lucky can you get?</p> 
<p>The letters go out to the membership today with the hope that we can 
deliver around the middle of the month. Historically, we wait until the spring 
winds calm somewhat so the plants will thrive instead of shrivel up and blow 
away.</p> 
<p>We have extra order forms here at the Visitor Center, so feel free to pick 
one up to order yours today. The baskets are $22 each (which includes delivery, 
by the way) and we order a limited number so don't delay.</p> 
<p>Kendall, at Circle T/ Ace Hardware, assures us these 12-inch baskets will 
be filled with beautiful, weather and drought-resistant flowers to last all 
summer long with just a minimum of TLC. If you have questions, just give a call 
to 264-2360 for info about the baskets.</p> 
<p><b>Thank you</b></p> 
<p>We want to thank Lillian Steele, Ron and Sheila Hunkin and Margaret Wilson 
for their &quot;above and beyond&quot; assistance helping us collate our 
quarterly newsletter, The Chamber Communiqu&eacute;. I believe we had a record 
number of inserts, so this was an especially daunting task this time, and we 
are most grateful for the helping hands.</p> 
<p>We're always thankful for our awesome board directors, but recently most 
especially for their help with our May SunDowner.</p> 
<p>Doug is the &quot;SunDowner Guy&quot; every month and pretty much 
organizes, schleps and single-handedly runs the show for these events. Doug was 
on vacation during last month's party, and the directors (and spouses) stepped 
up to the plate and got Morna and I through all the lifting, schlepping, 
pouring, anon, anon. Once again we are reminded how fortunate we are to have 
such a wonderful, fun, supportive board of directors. You all did real, real 
well when you elected them -thank you.</p> 
<p><b>Keyah Grande tour</b> </p> 
<p>It's still possible for you to attend the Keyah Grande tour even though you 
will have to pay $30 the day of the event, you silly person, because you didn't 
buy them before June 4. It would be worth far more than that to me to attend, 
but alas, you must be my representative.</p> 
<p>United Way of Archuleta County is pleased to offer the Wine and Cheese Tour 
of Keyah Grande Saturday, 3-6 p.m. You will be able to purchase the tickets at 
Keyah Grande as you enter the ranch. If you have questions, you can call Kathi 
DeClark at (970) 946-2057.</p> 
<p><b>Music in the Mountains</b></p> 
<p>The tickets for Music in the Mountains are diminishing from one day to the 
next, so please stop by and pick up what you need. You don't want to be one of 
those folks from last year who were crying in their beer about missing out on 
these incredible events. I hope to see all of you there, and with luck, we'll 
make these annual events here in Pagosa.</p> 
<p>On July 21, violinist Vadim Gluzman and pianist Angela Yoffe will perform 
Mozart and Prokofiev.</p> 
<p>Aviram Reichert and festival musicians will present &quot;Romancing the 
Piano&quot; July 25, and Antonio Pompa-Baldi and festival musicians will 
present Dvorak and other piano works Aug. 1, followed by a reception.</p> 
<p>Tickets are ever-so-affordable this year at $35 for the July performances 
and $45 for the August performance and reception.</p> 
<p>The Chamber of Commerce is the only ticket outlet for Music in the 
Mountains, so please stop by soon to pick up your tickets so you won't miss out 
on this fabulous opportunity. Give Doug a call at 264-2360 with questions. Just 
so you know, we can't hold tickets for you this year, but you can purchase them 
with a credit card if you like.</p> 
<p><b>July 4 Parade</b> </p> 
<p>Heads up. The theme for this year's fabulous Rotary July 4 Parade has been 
announced so you can start planning your float. &quot;Our American Heroes&quot; 
is what our Rotarians have designated as this year's theme so go for it and 
come up with the best float you can.</p> 
<p>While we're on the subject, the Chamber will again sponsor the famous Park 
to Park Arts and Crafts Festival in both parks July 4, 5, and 6 and the concert 
at Pagosa Lodge on the night of the Fourth. The Pagosa Hot Strings will be our 
headliners again with the wonderful addition of the Community Choir gracing us 
with lots of patriotic music both before and after the Strings' performance.</p>
<p>We're also planning to have the games and contests out at the Lodge 
beginning in the late afternoon on that day, so look for all the details coming 
up soon on July 4 in Pagosa Springs. It is truly one of our premier holidays 
with endless activities and fun stuff for every member of the family.</p> 
<p><b>Fair volunteers</b></p> 
<p>The county fair board is looking for volunteers of all ages, gender and 
levels of enthusiasm to help them with all kinds of assignments.</p> 
<p>You are needed to help set up and breakdown as well as for the open and 4-H 
class registration. Also needed are able-bodied folks for the first Lee 
Sterling Chile Taste that will take place July 31 and during the fair, Aug. 1,2 
and 3.</p> 
<p>If you can lend a hand, please fill out a registration form which you will

renewed members, allow me to announce the opening of one of our brand-new

<p><b>New books</b></p> 
<p>&quot;Dogs That Know When Their Owners Are Coming Home,&quot; by Rupert 
Sheldrake is a great book that gives new information about the animal behavior 
that defies scientific understanding.</p> 
<p>We've all heard stories about the animals that travel long distances to get 
back home. If you have stories about unusual animal happenings, this book 
invites you to share your stories and even do research.</p> 
<p>The book covers birds and fish as well as domestic animals. We're learning 
more everyday about the connections between man and animal. Sheldrake is a 
British scientist with excellent credentials.</p> 
<p>&quot;The October Horse,&quot; by Colleen McCullough is the last in a 
six-book series.</p> 
<p>Ms. McCullough is an Australian neurophysiologist who once worked as a 
researcher and teacher at Yale Medical School. Her writing career really took 
off with &quot;The Thorn Birds.&quot;</p> 
<p>McCullough has authored 10 other novels and also writes lyrics for musical 
theater. She now lives on Norfolk Island in the South Pacific. This book covers 
the famous love affair of Caesar and Cleopatra and the establishment of Rome.
</p> 
<p><b>Severe euphemisms</b> </p> 
<p>A librarian offered some new variations produced by 
&quot;over-sensitivity&quot; and what the euphemisms really mean.</p> 
<p>&quot;Cerebrally challenged&quot; (stupid). &quot;Chronologically 
gifted&quot; (old), and &quot;vertically inconvenienced&quot; (tall). I guess I 
must be &quot;horizontally challenged&quot; (fat). </p>

<p><b>Group of nine works to write charter for town government</b></p> 
<p><b>By Tess Noel Baker</b></p> 
<p><b>Staff Writer</b></p> 
<p>Every other Thursday, a group of nine - seven men and two women - are 
meeting to discuss the future of local government.</p> 
<p>They are the Town of Pagosa Springs Charter Commission and they are working 
to write a charter for the community: a document that would organize local 
government under home rule - an alternative form of government organization 
available under the Colorado State Constitution.</p> 
<p>According to the Colorado Municipal League Home Rule Handbook, the charter 
&quot;outlines the organizational structure of the municipality, establishes 
the basic procedures to be followed when the governing body acts and imposes 
restrictions on the powers of the municipality.&quot;</p> 
<p>It can include provisions for: form of government, qualifications of 
elected officials, size of governing council, terms of office, filling of 
vacancies, powers of the council, mayor and city manager, election procedures, 
administrative organization, boards and commissions, ordinances and 
resolutions, personnel, legal and judicial departments, budget control and 
financing, municipal borrowing and eminent domain.</p> 
<p>The commission has just 120 days to pull it all together. After that, it 
must present what it has produced to the town board and to the public for a 
vote. If the charter passes scrutiny by the residents of the town, it becomes 
the &quot;constitution,&quot; of sorts, for the town. If it fails in the eyes 
of voters, Pagosa remains a statutory municipality, governed by state statute 
in every area of local government.</p> 
<p>But a vote is a few months away. September at least.</p> 
<p>For now, the group of nine is working two or three hours at a time to put 
together a document that works for the present and the future of Pagosa Springs.
</p> 
<p>It's been going well, said Julie Jessen, the town's administrative intern 
who's been providing staff support for the commission.</p> 
<p>The group tackled council structure May 1; May 15 it was council procedure 
and elections, and May 29 commission members were scheduled to take a crack at 
recall, initiatives and ordinances. Recall will have to wait until at least 
June 12, but progress has been made.</p> 
<p>&quot;We get good discussion,&quot; commission co-chairman Darrel Cotton 
said. &quot;It's not hard-nosed, just good discussion.&quot;</p> 
<p>Jessen said the commission has worked completely through two articles - 
general provisions and the general structure of the board of trustees and town 
government.</p> 
<p>&quot;It's pretty much what we had before,&quot; Jessen said, &quot;This 
just spells it out.&quot;</p> 
<p>The group has discussed a few changes such as removing the term limits and 
creating voting districts - three districts, with two members of the board of 
trustees elected from each district. They are still debating how to elect 
representatives from the districts, she added.</p> 
<p>The question is: Should only the people in a district elect the 
representative from that district or should all the residents of the town have 
the opportunity to vote on representatives from the various districts? Homework 
over the next week includes polling family and friends about their feelings on 
the issue.</p> 
<p>&quot;I've asked several people today,&quot; commission member Mike Moran 
said. He also calls and asks friends in other home rule communities how certain 
things work.</p> 
<p>After all, the commission is not reinventing the wheel. Over 80 Colorado 
municipalities are currently governed by home rule charters that, according to 
proponents, allow more flexibility, more options and greater local control over 
local government.</p> 
<p>Pagosa's commission is considering examples from six other home rule 
communities, including: Brighton, Basalt, New Castle, Carbondale, Monument and 
Rico.</p> 
<p>To find something that might work for Pagosa Springs, Jessen said, 
commission members consider population and economic basis for each community. 
By evaluating the alternatives, they hope to come up with something that will 
fit Pagosa to a &quot;T.&quot;</p> 
<p>They have a lot of options. </p> 
<p>According to guidelines provided to Pagosa's commission, home rule charters 
are required to have provisions outlining procedures in three areas: 
initiative, referendum and recall, continuing, amending or repealing existing 
ordinances and a prefatory synopsis.</p> 
<p>The charter is restricted in its impact on franchises and from diminishing 
the tax rate established for state purposes by the general assembly or 
interfering with the collection of state taxes for state purposes.</p> 
<p>Moran said the goal and the biggest challenge of the commission has been to 
keep the charter broad in nature. &quot;We want to create something general in 
nature but forward-thinking enough to prepare for the future of the town,&quot; 
he said. &quot;The tendency is to look at minutia.&quot;</p> 
<p>Under the municipal league guidelines, broad, general charters work best in 
the long run. &quot;One of the major advantages of home rule is that it frees 
the municipality from the often excessive or outdated restrictions found in 
state statutes. If the home rule charter is itself extremely detailed or 
restrictive, the municipality and its citizens may not obtain the benefits 
offered by home rule.&quot; Instead, those things should be addressed in the 
ordinances or resolution process.</p> 
<p>Because it's all new, Cotton said, it's hard to know what to expect, and 
hard to know what the document will look like in the end. He remains optimistic.
</p> 
<p>&quot;I think it will be a good option,&quot; he said.</p> 
<p>The home rule commission's 120 days are up Aug. 6, but the goal is to 
present a completed document to the board of trustees at the regular meeting 
Aug. 5. The commission has just a handful of meetings and one public hearing to 
go and a good attitude to take with them.</p> 
<p>&quot;I think it will get a positive reaction from the community,&quot; 
Moran said. &quot;It's a fun group, a very serious group but it hasn't been 
contentious at all. There are no personal agendas, everyone is very 
amiable.&quot;</p> 
<p>Other members of the charter commission are Ross Aragon and Darrel Cotton, 
co-chairmen; Judith James, secretary; Tracy Bunning, Jerry Jackson, Marsha 
Preuit and Bill Whitbred. </p>

<p><b>Post near 'boiling springs' would not give protection, searcher said</b>
</p> 
<p><b>By John M. Motter</b></p> 
<p><b>PREVIEW Columnist</b></p> 
<p>Northern New Mexico was the jumping off point for exploration and 
settlement of the Four Corners area, especially Pagosa Country.</p> 
<p>Settlers tended flocks and planted gardens in the Tierra Amarilla area as 
early as 1862, maybe earlier. Permanent settlement waited another 15 or so 
years before coming to Pagosa Springs.</p> 
<p>By the time Joe Clarke built the first store and post office in Pagosa 
Springs during late 1877 or early 1878, sizable towns were flourishing at Lake 
City, Silverton, Ouray and Del Norte.</p> 
<p>A number of pioneers were clearing land at Los Pinos, now the Bayfield 
area. Others were making home further down the San Juan River in the general 
vicinity of Aztec and Farmington.</p> 
<p>But, earlier than any of those communities, in about 1862, homesteaders 
started a new life in a number of plazas along the upper Chama River in an area 
known as Los Tierra Amarillos.</p> 
<p>Among those plazas were Los Ojos, Los Brazos, Ensenada and others. Chama 
didn't come along until the railroad came through in 1880. Another of the 
plazas was Las Nutritas, known today as Tierra Amarilla.</p> 
<p>Tierra Amarilla remains the county seat of Rio Arriba County, a county 
which runs the length of the Chama River Valley to the other side of Espanola.
</p> 
<p>When miners first came into the San Juan Mountains during the early 1860s, 
especially on the southern side, the nearest place to buy groceries was Tierra 
Amarilla.</p> 
<p>Regular supply routes developed between TA and the upper Animas Valley 
mining regions. A number of routes were used. One led through what was to 
become Pagosa Springs. Another crossed today's Jicarilla Apache reservation at 
Caracas. Still another followed Largo Canyon.</p> 
<p>Fittingly, the first Army post in the San Juan region was built near Los 
Ojos in 1867. The following report by Bt. Lt. Col. E.H. Bergman was filed from 
Camp Plummer, New Mexico, March 15, 1867. The report was sent to Major General 
J.H. Carlton commanding the District of New Mexico from Santa Fe. Camp Plumber 
was located at today's Los Ojos down the road toward the fish hatchery.</p> 
<p>Bergman had been instructed to find a place for a post on the San Juan. He 
started Jan. 30 with an escort of 23 men and Nepomureno Waldez as a guide over 
&quot;frightfully rough country, deep snow, through dense forests, and without 
a road.&quot;</p> 
<p>Bergman leaves us this description of his trek between T.A. and the Piedra 
River:</p> 
<p>&quot;Very little can be said in favor of that portion of the country 
commencing a little beyond Camp Plummer and running up to nearly where the 
reconnoitering trail strikes &quot;Rio Piedra &#138; About 8 miles before the 
above mentioned river appears a beautiful phenomenon - a boiling spring. The 
rocky cavity of this spring in circumference, has an almost perfect funnel 
shape and measures nearly two hundred feet. Several soundings made, proved a 
depth of 41 feet. The temperature of the water is at least 212 degrees 
Fahrenheit and in unceasing agitation. Large bubbles rising from the bottom are 
violently drawn some inches above the surface of the water and cloudy vapors 
strongly impregnated with sulfur are rising in large quantities from the 
same.&quot;</p> 
<p>Bergman wasn't much of a scientist - the bottom of the Great Pagosa Hot 
Springs remains to be found, but is well over 1,000 feet, and the water 
temperature is around 144 degrees Fahrenheit. Gas bubbles bouncing out of the 
water no longer occur.</p> 
<p>&quot;A post located on the River San Juan in the vicinity of the boiling 
springs,&quot; Bergman noted, &quot;would not afford protection to the settlers 
on the rivers west of this stream. In the wintertime troops would hardly be 
able to move out of the fort.&quot;</p> 
<p>Later, in 1878, the Army ignored Bergman's recommendation and constructed 
Fort Lewis at Pagosa Springs near the &quot;boiling spring.&quot;</p> 
<p>Bergman also concluded: &quot;This part of New Mexico and Colorado 
territory is beyond doubt, the best portion of it, altho I viewed it in the 
most unfavorable light, and needs only an industrious population to the 
advantages nature so generously affords here. The population will soon flock to 
this region as soon as the fact is known that they shall have protection from 
the Indians. Men who were in 1860 and 1861 here in search of gold have 
expressed there desire to return to this country for the purpose of farming, 
mining, stock-raising and indeed many are already preparing to go, as soon as 
they hear troops will be sent to protect them.&quot;</p>

<p><b>Game, set and match</b> </p> 
<p>Pagosa Country politics is a game with repeated volleys crossing </p> 
<p>the net before points are scored, before any victory, however tem-</p> 
<p>porary, can be predicted and secured. The game is often played amid 
controversy, with some measure of risk. Such is the case with the process 
leading to a decision Tuesday by county commissioners concerning operational 
details for an asphalt plant south of town near the San Juan River.</p> 
<p>This match, (which may not be over), is a clear example of how government 
in a small community works, or doesn't - of how people express themselves and 
of the uncertain art of compromise. More important, it illuminates our lack of 
a consistent means for handling land use problems in the county. </p> 
<p>The problem began with objections to a gravel pit operation at a site south 
of town. A proposal was then made to put an asphalt plant nearby for a limited 
period of time. Planning staff determined the request fit the limited use 
category, and an administrative decision was made to approve the operation 
through Oct. 1 without a public hearing process.</p> 
<p>Residents with nearby properties flared - some with false accusations, 
stating there was pressure brought to bear on the planning staff - but others 
with reasonable concerns. Some exaggerated the situation with alarmist 
proposals of a Three Mile Island within earshot of town and chances for 
catastrophic pollution to air and water. The alarmists clouded the very real 
complaints any of us would have if we woke to hear, see and smell an industrial 
plant close by.</p> 
<p>The other side of the situation: The operators of the plant intended to 
produce asphalt for the paving of U.S. 84 from town to the border, and to meet 
all requirements, including those monitored by the state department of health 
and environment.</p> 
<p>The plant met standards. It was approved.</p> 
<p>When the operators went to the planning commission last week to request an 
extension of operating hours, they again met with valid objections, and some 
inexcusably poor public behavior.</p> 
<p>Their argument: Allow additional hours per day and the number of days the 
plant operates with attendant noise, smoke, potential hazard is kept to a 
minimum. Deny the hours, and possibly force the plant to move, create worse 
highway traffic and safety problems and, perhaps, prolong the life of the 
project and the need for the plant. Opponents continued to voice their concerns 
about potential problems, arguing about the nature of regulations. </p> 
<p>The planning commission recommended the extension, agreeing with former 
county commissioner Gene Crabtree who urged that benefit to the greatest number 
of people - swift completion of the highway project - should guide the decision.
</p> 
<p>Tuesday, the commissioners voted 2-1 against the planning commission 
recommendation and refused the request for extended hours.</p> 
<p>The game is over, but the match is undecided. Siding with opponents of the 
plant, the commissioners take the risk of delaying the paving enough to push 
the work into next year, keeping U.S. 84 hostage to the project, continuing all 
the problems, physical and economic, that implies.</p> 
<p>Then again, maybe the compromise, greasing the squeaky wheel, will pay off.
</p> 
<p>That's the game.</p> 
<p>The situation indicates we still have a greater problem to remedy. We lack 
comprehensive land use regulations to deal with growth, where defined 
populations in the county can determine what happens on the land in the zone 
around them. </p> 
<p>For those residents of Holiday Acres who are concerned about the asphalt 
plant, for those residents in the river valley nearby, such regulations might 
have kept this game from ever occurring. It's time to use the frustration and 
lessons of the experience to stimulate prompt institution of comprehensive land 
use regulations throughout the county.</p> 
<p>Only then will we have game, set and match.</p>

<p><b>The land of 2-vehicle families</b></p> 
<p><b>By Richard Walter</b></p> 
<p>You're sure there has to be a gazillion more cars on Pagosa Country roads 
now than when you arrived in Archuleta County.</p> 
<p>Or, like many, you can remember the old, old days when purchase of a new 
automobile was front page news. </p> 
<p>You see new roads being built, old roads being rebuilt, and traffic signals 
proliferating.</p> 
<p>You've had to wait up to five minutes to make a left turn off westbound U.S 
. 160 at 6th, 7th or 8th streets and just knew the community must be overrun 
with tourists - and it's not even summer yet.</p> 
<p>Right! On all counts.</p> 
<p>But you'd be at least partially wrong to blame the tourists or those just 
passing through, though it would be logical conclusion.</p> 
<p>Behind the whole traffic congestion spurt in the county is a huge increase 
in the number of licensed vehicles using the roads and registered in the county.
</p> 
<p>June Madrid, county clerk, is the keeper of auto registration statistics 
and her office is the one where license plates are issued for everything that 
rolls down our roadways. </p> 
<p>Now, first you have to keep in mind that the last census showed this is a 
county with approximately 10,000 residents.</p> 
<p>As of the last day of 2002, the county had 19,923 registered vehicles using 
the roadways. That's nearly two for every family in the county.</p> 
<p>That means we're just like the rest of the country, two cars in every 
drive. Some may have more, some less.</p> 
<p>And the total includes everything which must be licensed - 18-wheelers, 
gravel trucks, cement trucks, pickups, automobiles, travel trailers, mobile 
homes, personal trailers and even motorcycles.</p> 
<p>Of course, licensing is a statistic always in flux. Each day finds new 
expirations and new registrations but computers have allowed Madrid's office to 
stay on top of the statistical nightmare that has created a great portion of 
the traffic problem we see.</p> 
<p>The statistics do not take into account vehicles being used commercially in 
Archuleta County or those of people who have moved here and not transferred 
their license plates.</p> 
<p>When it comes to trying to get out onto U.S. 160 from almost any side 
street in what we might call the county's urban area, it sometimes seems like 
all 20,000 vehicles are approaching at the same time - from one direction or 
the other.</p> 
<p>The average per family might be skewed, too, by Census Bureau data. Most 
residents, including Madrid, aren't sold on the 10,000 population figure as 
being accurate. A more common assumption is closer to 15,000 if all heads were 
actually counted.</p> 
<p>Number crunchers can have a field day trying now to figure out just how 
many of those 20,000 vehicles are on the roads in the county every day, how 
many more are added by the pass-through traffic and vacationing tourists.</p> 
<p>Maybe the highway planners on the front range ought to look at the Internet 
picture from the camera atop the courthouse during our &quot;rush&quot; hours.
</p> 
<p>They might then realize more accurately how the rest of Colorado has grown.

<p>Last Friday a dozen survivors of the grand army that soldiered in the many 
campaigns from Bull Run to Appomattox marched again to Pagosa's cemeteries in 
remembrance of sleeping comrades. Next year those who are left will again 
remember, but the straggling line will grow thinner with each recurring 
Memorial Day and soon, all too soon, the boys of '63, will live only in the
