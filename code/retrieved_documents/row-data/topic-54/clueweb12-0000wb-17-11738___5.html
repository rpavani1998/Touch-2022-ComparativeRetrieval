<b>Home Fruit Production - Avocado</b><br>

<b>Introduction</b></p> 
<p> Avocado is a medium to large evergreen tree with large, leathery, deep 
green leaves. It has limited commercial value in the lower Rio Grande Valley 
and is often found in landscapes across South Texas. The popularity of its 
fruit, particularly in Mexican food dishes, and its tropical appearance have 
spurred considerable interest in growing avocados at home.</p> 
<p> <b>Climate</b></p> 
<p> The most limiting factor to success with avocado trees is severe cold. 
Avocado is a tropical to subtropical tree that, with some exceptions, is best 
adapted to relatively frost-free areas. Some types are killed outright by 
moderate freezes and others have regenerated after sustaining complete death of 
all aboveground parts in severe freezes.</p> 
<p> <b>Soil and Site Selection</b></p> 
<p> Avocado trees are adapted to most soil types found in South Texas, 
provided the soil has good internal drainage. The tree will not perform well in 
poorly drained soils, nor will it tolerate flooding. The planting site should 
be chosen with cold protection in mind, especially in areas where annual winter 
frosts or freezes are common. Generally, the south or southeast side of the 
house is the warmest location in a residential site. Because it can become a 
large tree, it should be planted no closer than 8 to 10 feet from the house.</p>
<p> <b>Varieties</b></p> 
<p> There are three distinct horticultural races of avocado -- West Indian, 
Guatemalan and Mexican -- plus hybrids between them. West Indian types are the 
least cold tolerant and somewhat watery in flavor, but they have the greatest 
tolerance to salinity and some diseases. For our purposes, West Indian avocados 
are useful primarily as rootstocks because of their high salt tolerance.</p> 
<p> The Mexican race is the most cold tolerant but the least salt tolerant. 
Its fruit ripens in the summer and is usually of good flavor. The fruit is 
rarely larger than 8 to 12 ounces, is green to purple or black, and has very 
thin skin. Because the skin is so thin, the fruit are very susceptible to 
disease. The crushed leaves of the Mexican race of avocados have a distinct 
odor of anise (licorice), which is lacking in the other races.</p> 
<p> The Guatemalan race of avocados is essentially intermediate between the 
other two, and its hybrids with the other two races include many of the more 
important varieties in commerce.</p> 
<p> Describing varieties is difficult, inasmuch as there exist several 
so-called varieties that originated as seedling trees in home plantings across 
South Texas. Most are Mexican race seedlings, but they have not been described 
in the horticultural literature, so information about them is lacking. One such 
variety is Holland, a Mexican race seedling tree that grew and survived several 
hard winters in Uvalde. R-1, Pancho, Capri and numerous others have appeared 
and apparently been lost. Most are lacking in truly good quality. There are 
varieties having higher than usual cold tolerance -- Gainesville, Winter 
Mexican and others -- but they are not of notable fruit quality. Sadly, they 
are not readily available.</p> 
<p> 'Lula' is the variety of commerce in the lower Rio Grande Valley, with 
fruits nearing a pound in size and having a green, thick peel which resists 
disease quite well. It matures in October and stores well on-tree into January 
or February. 'Lula' sustains severe freeze damage below 27 degrees, although it 
commonly regrows from below ground. Seeds from 'Lula' are the preferred 
rootstock for all avocados in South Texas, as it is fairly tolerant to existing 
soil salinity.</p> 
<p> The flowering habit of avocados is unique in that the flowers are perfect, 
having both male and female organs, but the parts do not function together. 
Flowers of type A varieties open in the morning as receptive females, then 
close in the afternoon until the following afternoon when they reopen for 
pollen shed. On the other hand, flowers of type B avocados open in the 
afternoon as receptive females, close overnight and reopen the following 
morning to shed pollen. In important avocado-producing areas, orchards are 
interplanted with varieties of both types to assure good pollination. However, 
under South Texas conditions, there is sufficient overlap between the phases of 
a flower type that pollination and fruit set are rarely a problem.</p> 
<p> <b>Propagation and Planting</b></p> 
<p> Avocados do not come true from seed, and seedlings may take up to 10 to 15 
years to fruit. Most avocado fruit in Texas supermarkets are from California, 
whose varieties are principally Mexican race or Mexican-Guatemalan hybrids. As 
such, seedlings grown from such seeds will normally exhibit moderate to severe 
leaf tip burn and marginal necrosis from salt injury. Consequently, they should 
not be grown as seedlings for rootstock use. Propagation in Texas is mostly by 
cleft (tip) grafting, but other types of graftage work. Some Mexican-race 
avocados can be rooted or air- layered, although the lack of salinity tolerance 
remains a problem for such own-rooted plants. Avocado grafts are commonly 
inserted quite close to the soil line of the rootstock. It is common practice 
to plant the tree deeper than normal so that the graft is at or below ground 
level. In addition, soil is mounded around the trunk as the tree grows to 
assure that the graft union is below ground. Thus, trees killed to the ground 
by severe cold will regenerate from varietal wood rather than from rootstock. 
Because most avocado trees are produced in containers of soilless media, much 
of the outer layer of media should be washed off the sides and top of the root 
ball just before placing the tree in the planting hole. When backfilling is 
completed, plus the extra soil above the plant's prior soil line, the outer 
root system is in contact with the soil in which it must grow, so the plant is 
more likely to survive transplanting and begin to grow. Newly-planted trees 
should be staked for support and most require shading during the first several 
months. A burlap-covered cage about a foot higher than the tree is commonly 
placed around the tree in the Valley for both shading and wind protection. In 
multiple plantings, avocados should be spaced 15 to 25 feet from each other and 
from other large trees.</p> 
<p> <b>Culture</b></p> 
<p> The elimination of weed and grass competition is critical during the first 
two or three years after planting. Once competition is eliminated, organic 
mulches can effectively prevent further problems. Avocado irrigation is no 
different from citrus or other fruit and nut trees--water slowly, deeply and 
thoroughly. Avoid wasting water to runoff and do not allow water to stand 
around the tree for more than a few hours. Fertilization of avocados is 
essentially the same as for other fruit and nut trees in South Texas: ammonium 
sulfate (21-0-0) at the rate of one half cup per month in the first year, one 
cup per month in the second year and two cups per month in the third year. 
Fertilization should be applied monthly from February to September. Thereafter, 
apply one to two cups per year per inch of trunk diameter, split into equal 
applications in February, May and September. Pruning is unnecessary for growing 
trees, but freeze-damaged wood should be cut out in the spring. If only limb 
damage occurs, wait until regrowth commences and cut back to live tissue. If 
the tree is killed to the ground, cut it off at ground level--the regenerated 
tree will be naturally multi- trunked or the excess sprouts can be removed to 
permit only one to reform the tree.</p> 
<p> <b>Cold Protection</b></p> 
<p> Deep planting and subsequent soil mounding around the trunk are the best 
assurances that the avocado will survive a severe freeze, even if the top is 
completely killed. When a severe freeze is being forecast, mound additional 
soil around the trunk for extra protection, then water thoroughly two or three 
days before the cold weather is expected. Young trees can be draped (not 
wrapped) with a blanket, quilt, tarp or even plastic during the freeze event. 
The corners of the covering should be pulled outward and anchored to the 
ground--it is not necessary that the covering reach to the ground. Any 
additional practical heat source under the tented tree will probably save even 
the leaves. Examples include incandescent lights, decorative lights, electric 
heaters and camp lanterns or stoves.</p> 
<p> <b>Production, Maturity and Use</b></p> 
<p> Grafted varieties will produce a few fruit two years after establishment 
(which is defined as the tree having made significant growth after planting). 
Mature trees can produce two to three or more bushels of avocados with good 
management, depending upon variety. Mexican-race seedlings and varieties 
typically mature during the summer; 'Lula' and most other hybrids mature in 
September or October. Storage on-tree is common, and 'Lula' will store on-tree 
into January because of cooler temperatures. Avocado fruits do not ripen on the 
tree--they must be harvested and held for several days. The optimum temperature 
range for ripening includes the cooler range of most home air conditioning 
settings. Avocado maturity, if unknown, can be easily determined, as the fruit 
is mature when it will soften to good eating quality. Pick a couple of fruit 
and set them on the kitchen counter (out of direct sun). A mature fruit will 
soften within three to eight days. If the fruit don't soften, try again every 
week or so with new fruit until you achieve softening. When fruit softens, 
check it for eating quality. Summer-maturing avocados will begin to drop 
heavily because of disease as they mature. Some types do not always soften well 
under Texas conditions. For the most part, avocados are consumed fresh, alone 
or in salads, dips, appetizers, guacamole and pico de gallo. Overripe fruit can 
be pureed and frozen for later use, particularly for avocado cream soup and 
dips.</p> 
<p> <b>Problems, Disease and Insect Pests</b></p> 
<p> The most common problem of avocados in Texas is tip burn and marginal 
necrosis caused by water stress and salinity, which is most prevalent during 
hot, dry weather. This problem is most acute on Mexican-race seedlings and 
rootstocks; it can be tempered somewhat by more uniform and regular watering. 
Some avocados are prone to complete defoliation at the time of flowering. New 
leaves will develop almost immediately, so there is no cause for concern. The 
most serious disease of avocados is anthracnose, which is primarily a disease 
of fruit nearing maturity. It starts as circular, sunken brown to black spots 
that are quite small. With time, the spots can enlarge to half an inch or more 
and are prone to cause the fruit to crack horizontally and vertically across 
the spot. Anthracnose is particularly severe on thin-skinned types, but rarely 
causes significant losses on 'Lula' and other thick-skinned fruits. Other 
fungal diseases such as cercospora spot, powdery mildew and scab are rarely 
encountered in Texas, but are serious problems in the humid tropics. Few 
insects have been documented on Texas avocados, although mites sometimes occur 
on the foliage. None has been severe enough to warrant control measures. 
Possums apparently thrive on mature avocado fruit and will climb the tree to 
feed in the absence of fruit on the ground.</p>
