<h1> Cold temperatures bring questions at local fruit farms </h1>  Adams 
orchard owners worry about damage to trees already in bloom.<br>

 Fernando Rodriguez, a worker at The Peters Orchards, 
trims early blooming peach trees on Monday afternoon at the orchard outside of 
York Springs. Apricot and peach trees in area orchards are in full bloom, along 
with a variety of other fruit crops, and local farmers are hoping recent low 
temperatures won t cause damage to the vulnerable fruit. (THE EVENING SUN SHANE

<p> </p> 
<p> </p> 
<p> </p> 
<p> </p> 
<p> </p> 
<p> </p> 
<p> </p> 
<p> </p> 
<p> March is not the time to see tiny green buds forming on a blueberry plant 
or asparagus tips sticking their heads above ground.</p> 
<p> It's not the time for sweet cherries, peaches, apples and nectarines to be 
in bloom.</p> 
<p> &quot;We have farmed here since 1955,&quot; said Kay Hollabaugh, a 
spokeswoman for the Hollabaugh Brothers' Fruit Farm and Market in Biglerville. 
&quot;No one remembers apple blossoms in March.&quot;</p> 
<p> But growth and bloom started about three to four weeks early at most local 
fruit farms when March came in like a lamb and when the warm days turned into 
warm weeks.</p> 
<p> So when the temperature abruptly dipped by Monday night and into Tuesday 
morning, farmers were in their fields and orchards before</p>  Miguel Cintora, 
a worker at The Peters Orchards outside of York Springs, walks up rows of 
blooming peach trees on Monday afternoon. After weeks of warm weather, fruit 
trees are blooming about three to four weeks early and are more susceptible to 
damage when temperatures dip below freezing. (THE EVENING SUN SHANE DUNLAP)<br>

 sunrise, checking the situation and hoping there wouldn't be too much damage 
to their vulnerable fruit.
<p> &quot;When the blooms open up and the petals open up and are out there in 
the open, that's the most susceptible time,&quot; said Ed McDannell, who along 
with his wife operates McDannell's Fruit Farm and Market in Biglerville. 
&quot;They'll tolerate only a certain amount of cold temperature, freezing 
temperature.&quot;</p> 
<p> Temperatures reached a low of about 26 degrees in York County, and Adams 
County fruit farmers reported lows of between 26 to 29 degrees around sunrise 
on Tuesday.</p> 
<p> It's still early to tell what, if any, damage there was, though some 
farmers believed there could be damage to fruits like plums, apricots, peaches, 
sweet cherries and nectarines, which are further along in the growth process 
and are more susceptible to damage.</p> 
<p> Rather than the threat of frost, &quot;it's the temperature we're the most 
concerned about,&quot; said Tara Baugher, a tree fruit educator in the Adams 
County office of the Penn State Extension.</p> 
<p> The further the temperature dips below freezing, the higher percentage of 
buds killed. For example, Baugher said farmers of most apple varieties could 
expect a 10 percent kill at 28 degrees and a 90 percent kill at 24 degrees.</p> 
<p> &quot;It's borderline,&quot; Baugher said of the recent cold snap.</p> 
<p> Local fruit farmers are hoping for a bit more normalcy than March has 
shown so far, and that the predicted colder weather will &quot;put the brakes 
on things,&quot; as Hollabaugh said, without causing too much damage.</p> 
<p> Most people probably aren't aware of the role temperature plays throughout 
the entire growing cycle, Hollabaugh said. Take the apple crop - more than warm 
temperatures in the spring and summer, it takes cold nights in the fall to put 
color on apples.</p> 
<p> So if apples that typically mature in September and October are a month 
ahead in the growing cycle, they might not get the cold nights they need for 
good color.</p> 
<p> &quot;How do you sell a Red Delicious apple </p>  The Bradford pear trees 
are in full bloom in front of Holy Trinity Lutheran Church in York Springs. 
Local farmers say the budding trees and flowers popping up gave an early 
indication that fruit trees would also bloom early this year. (THE EVENING SUN

 that's not red?&quot; Hollabaugh asked. 
<p> Most of the nights this week are expected to stay above freezing in 
temperature. Tuesday night was expected to be milder with temperatures in the 
mid-30s and Wednesday's high temperatures were predicted to be in the 70s, said 
meteorologist Craig Evanego of the National Weather Service in State College.
</p> 
<p> Thursday night's low would be around freezing, Evanego said.</p> 
<p> &quot;(Frost) is a possibility Thursday night,&quot; he added.</p> 
<p> Local farmers said they would continue to check on forecasts and 
temperatures.</p> 
<p> &quot;But there's not a whole lot we can do,&quot; McDannell said. 
&quot;You hope and you pray that things are going to be in our favor.&quot;</p>
