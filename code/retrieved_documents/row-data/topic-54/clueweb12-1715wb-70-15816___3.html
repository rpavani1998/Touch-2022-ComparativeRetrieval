benefits of the aronia berries like other dark pigmented berries such as 
blueberries, black currant, salal and bilberries. Antioxidants, cardiovascular 
system support, anti-aging properties, digestive aids and help in maintaining 
blood sugar levels to name a few! The berries are not particular tasty fresh to 
humans but the juices can be made into a number of wonderful items such as 
juices, wines, syrups, sauces, marinades, chutney and pies. If you don't care 
to harvest the fruit, the songbirds and other wildlife will gladly take care of 
that for you! <br>
