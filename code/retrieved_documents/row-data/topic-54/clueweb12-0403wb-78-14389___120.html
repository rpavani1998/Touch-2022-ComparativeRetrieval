<h1>Travelling with diabetes</h1> 
<p>New Zealanders love travelling to warmer climes during our cold winter 
months.<strong>Alison Pask</strong>, a New Zealand registered dietitian,gives 
some suggestions to help you enjoy your trip and stay healthy.</p> 
<p>Hayden and his wife Ange on a long-tail boat in Thailand</p> 
<p>Some of the common issues of travelling for people with diabetes include:
</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Delayed flights resulting in delayed meals</li> 
<li>Changes in the type and amount of food eaten</li> 
<li>Unavailability of appropriate food or drink</li> 
<li>Use of unfamiliar ingredients</li> 
<li>Different amounts of physical activity than usual - this could be less if 
you are sitting on a beach or more if you are sightseeing.</li> </ul> 
<p>You may wish to test your blood glucose more frequently, especially if your 
activity and food routines are changed. Testing will help you adjust to the 
circumstances of different routines.</p> 
<p>To keep in control of your diabetes, planning is the key.</p> 
<p>Hayden Vink from Diabetes Youth Wellington (in the picture above), who was 
diagnosed on his first world trip, has never let having Type 1 diabetes stop 
him from travelling.</p> 
<p>'To stay on top of my diabetes, I test as often as I can, and adjust my 
insulin doses until I've got used to the time zone, food and activity.</p> 
<p>'This usually means reducing my insulin initially, but perhaps having an 
extra injection or two, especially on long flights. I also make sure I carry 
high-glucose food should I need it.'</p> 
<h2><strong>Things to plan for</strong></h2> 
<ul> 
<li>Your method of travel on arrival e.g. car, bus or plane. If you are 
driving once you arrive at your destination, you will have more control over 
stopping for meals.</li> 
<p></p> 
<li>Will you be in isolated areas where there are no shops? If so, carefully 
plan your food supplies to ensure you have adequate food for your stay.</li> 
<p></p> 
<li>If you are doing lots of walking, drink extra fluids, especially if you 
are in a country with a warmer climate.</li> 
<p></p> 
<li>Will you be eating out, cooking for yourself or relying on others to 
prepare your meals?</li> 
<p></p> 
<li>If you are going to a foreign country with different cultures, learn about 
the local foods and drinks. Find out which foods contain carbohydrate.</li> 
<p></p> 
<li>Always carry essential items with you including your medication, a letter 
from your doctor, blood glucose monitoring equipment, glucose tablets to treat 
a hypo, and some carbohydrate food e.g. a fruit bar. Ensure these are easily 
available at all times. Have a glucose tablet in your pocket - in the middle of 
a hypo you won't want to try to locate your cabin baggage and find your glucose.
</li> 
<p></p> </ul> 
<h2>Visit your health care team before you leave</h2> 
<p>If you are crossing time zones, you may need to adjust your medication or 
insulin. Make an appointment to discuss this with your doctor or diabetes nurse 
specialist. Remember to take your itinerary with you to the appointment.</p> 
<p>Make an appointment to see your dietitian to discuss suitable foods. Jot 
down a list of questions to ask.</p> 
<p>Ensure you have adequate supplies of medication, insulin, needles, test 
strips and any other medical supplies you may need. These may not be available 
in the country you are visiting.</p> 
<h2><strong>Prepare beforehand</strong></h2> 
<p>If you are overweight, losing just a few kilograms can make a big 
difference in your overall enjoyment of the trip.</p> 
<p>Order a MedicAlert bracelet (0800 840 111 or www.medicalert.co.nz) as it's 
vital that you are identified in any medical emergency. Ask around and talk to 
people who have travelled to your destination as they may have valuable tips.
</p> 
<p>Discuss departure times and arrivals with your travel agent to find an 
itinerary suited to your needs. Or you can book on the internet to choose 
flights that best suit you.</p> 
<p>It is generally accepted that people with diabetes don't need to order 
special meals while flying and you should be able to make wise food choices 
from the meals offered. However, if you have other conditions that require 
special meals e.g. gluten free, phone the airline at least a week before you 
leave to order your 'special meal'.</p> 
<p>Or ensure your travel agent does this when booking your flight. You must 
order such meals before you fly, as the cabin crew will not be able to conjure 
one up once in the air.</p> 
<h2><strong>Taking your own food on a flight</strong></h2> 
<p>Find out if your airline has any restrictions on the types and quantities 
of food and drinks you are allowed to carry with you. If your flight is delayed 
and dinner ends up being served late, you will need to eat. To avoid such 
crises, take along some wholegrain crackers, cheese wedges, fruit bars and 
suitable drinks.</p> 
<p>If you take insulin, it's a good idea to wait until you actually have your 
meal before injecting, this way you will not have a problem if your meal is 
delayed.</p> 
<p>Some flights such as Freedom Air from New Zealand to Australia no longer 
serve food. Rather than relying on the food available to purchase onboard, take 
your own in a small chilly bag e.g. sandwiches, salads, bread rolls, fruit, 
bran muffins, wholegrain crackers and low fat cheese.</p> 
<p>For something hot, take some dehydrated soup and ask for a cup of hot water 
onboard.</p> 
<p>Many countries have very strict laws governing the importation of food, 
particularly fresh food such as meat and fruit. If you are going to a country 
that prohibits importing food, either make sure that you consume all your 
provisions before you disembark, or leave the uneaten food behind in the plane, 
but do explain this to the cabin crew first.</p> 
<h2>Drinks</h2> 
<p>For any flight lasting more than two hours, stock up on non-alcoholic 
liquids. Drink as much water and sugar free drinks as possible during the 
flight.</p> 
<p>Take your own bottle of water along. By keeping your water balance 
positive, you won&rsquo;t feel as tired and irritable when you reach your 
destination.</p> 
<p>Alcohol contributes to dehydration so stay away from alcoholic drinks while 
flying. Alcohol could also contribute to your blood glucose levels falling 
below what is desirable, resulting in a hypo.</p> 
<h2><strong>Once at your destination</strong></h2> 
<p>Breakfast is the most important meal of the day. Even if you have slept in, 
ensure you start the day with a good breakfast.</p> 
<p>Choose wholegrain bread, cereals, fruit, low fat yoghurt or a poached egg 
on toast. Instant oatmeal porridge is great to take with you or buy when you 
arrive. Just add water and your breakfast is done.</p> 
<p>Follow these simple suggestions and you&rsquo;ll enjoy your holiday and 
bring home happy memories to share with your friends and family.</p>

<h1>The right food for your teeth</h1> 
<p>Choosing the right foods will not only help keep your blood glucose levels 
within the desirable range, thereby reducing the chance of gum disease, but 
will also reduce your chance of developing cavities in your teeth.</p> 
<h2>Water</h2> 
<p>Water is the best drink. Tap water is preferable to bottled water as it 
generally contains fluoride which protects teeth.</p> 
<p>To enable you to eat the foods recommended for good health such as plenty 
of fruit and vegetables, wholegrain breads and cereals, your teeth need to be 
in optimum condition.</p> 
<p>Calcium is essential for strong teeth and bones. Milk and milk products or 
soy products are good sources of calcium.</p> 
<h2><strong></strong></h2> 
<h2><strong>What effect does sugar have?</strong></h2> 
<p>Eating sugar is a cause of tooth decay. But it's not just how much sugar 
you eat. When and how you eat it can be just as important to keeping teeth 
healthy.</p> 
<p>When you eat sugary foods or drink sweet drinks frequently throughout the 
day, the bacteria in your mouth mix with the sugars to make a mild acid. This 
acid attacks enamel, the hard outer layer of teeth. It can make holes called 
cavities in the teeth. This acid attacks teeth for at least 20 minutes after 
food is eaten.</p> 
<p>Any kind of sugar will mix with bacteria in the mouth. Natural sugars can 
have the same effect on teeth as white sugar. Many foods contain natural sugars.
</p> 
<p>For example, milk contains a natural sugar called lactose and fruit juice 
contains fructose. Even fruit juice that says 'no sugar added' still contains 
natural sugar.</p> 
<p>Hard sweets such as barley sugars, cough drops and mints that contain sugar 
are especially harmful because they dissolve slowly in your mouth exposing your 
teeth to acids for prolonged periods of time. Sticky foods such as dried fruits 
and fruit leathers also contain a lot of sugar and can stick to teeth for long 
periods of time.</p> 
<h2><strong>How can you determine the sugar content?</strong></h2> 
<p>Read the labels of the packaged food you buy. By law, every ingredient in 
packaged food is listed by weight. So if a sugar is listed as one of the first 
three ingredients, you&rsquo;ll know there is a lot of sugar in the food.</p> 
<p>Other names for sugar include:</p> 
<p>&bull; Brown sugar &bull; Caster sugar&nbsp;&bull; Corn syrup &bull; 
Dextrose &bull; Disaccharides &bull; Fructose &bull; Glucose &bull; Golden 
syrup &bull; Honey &bull; Invert sugar &bull; Lactose &bull; Malt extract 
&bull; Maltose&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Check if liquid medicines such as cough syrup have sugars. Ask your doctor 
or pharmacist to give you medicines that are sugar free.</p> 
<h2>7 steps to look after your teeth</h2> 
<ol> 
<li>Sugary foods or foods containing carbohydrates cause less harm to your 
teeth when eaten with a meal than when they're eaten alone. This is because the 
production of saliva, which washes away the sugar and bacteria, is increased.
</li> 
<li>Eating sugary foods before you go to bed can be the most damaging because 
you don't produce as much saliva when you sleep. So avoid sweet items such as 
sweet biscuits for supper.</li> 
<li>Everyone should aim to brush their teeth twice a day, in the morning after 
breakfast and at night just before bed.</li> 
<li>Chewing sugar free gum can help increase the production of saliva, which 
in turn can help to protect your teeth from decay.</li> 
<li>In-between meal snacks are not always necessary. Check with your health 
care team if snacks are recommended as part of your diabetes management plan. 
Some suitable snacks include cheese, popcorn, raw veggies, yoghurt, fresh 
fruit, nuts and seeds. Your dietitian will provide you with further suggestions.
</li> 
<li>Cigarettes can stain your teeth, and contribute to gum disease. Coffee, 
tea or red wine may also stain your teeth. Avoid hard foods like ice or popcorn 
kernels as these can damage the enamel.</li> 
<li>Remember to visit your dentist at least twice a year for a check up.</li>

<h1>Salt - how to eat less</h1> 
<p>The World Health Organisation has estimated that if everyone in the world 
reduced their intake of salt by 2.9g a day, the number of deaths from strokes 
would reduce by 22% and there would be a 16% reduction in deaths from heart 
disease. Dietitian<strong>Alison Pask</strong> explains why we should eat less 
salt and how to cut back.</p> 
<p>Try these flavourings instead of salt</p> 
<p>Salt is a compound called sodium chloride, of which about 40% is sodium. 
Sodium is an essential nutrient as it regulates our water balance, maintains 
blood volume, controls muscles and nerve function, and helps to maintain our 
body temperature.</p> 
<p>Salt is the main source of sodium in our diet. However, we need only tiny 
amounts.</p> 
<p>All types of salt contain sodium including table salt, NA+, sea salt, rock 
salt, vegetable salt, MSG or any compound beginning with sodium e.g. sodium 
bicarbonate.</p> 
<h2><strong>Why is salt added to food?</strong></h2> 
<p>Salt is added for flavour, to preserve food to extend its life, and to stop 
the growth of bacteria which can cause food poisoning. That's why salty foods 
like bacon and ham last longer than other meats.</p> 
<p>Cheese manufacturers rely on salt to create the correct environment for the 
cheese-making process. In bread-making the salt controls the yeast fermentation.
</p> 
<h2><strong>Where does salt in our diet come from?</strong></h2> 
<ul> 
<li>10% found naturally in food</li> 
<li>15% added during cooking</li> 
<li>75% in processed and manufactured foods </li> </ul> 
<h2><strong>What foods are high in salt?</strong></h2> 
<ul> 
<li>Bread, biscuits, cheese, butter</li> 
<li>Takeaways</li> 
<li>Snacks e.g. salted nuts, chippies</li> 
<li>Sauces, soy sauce, gravy powder, stock cubes, yeast extract, packet soups
</li> 
<li>Processed meats e.g. ham, bacon, corned beef</li> 
<li>Foods containing MSG</li> 
<li>Pickled vegetables e.g. olives, gherkins.</li> </ul> 
<h2><strong>Why do we have to cut back?</strong></h2> 
<p>Salt is linked to high blood pressure in some people, which in turn 
increases the risk of a stroke, heart attack and kidney damage.</p> 
<p>If you retain fluid, you may find cutting back on your salt intake will 
help your condition. Discuss this with your doctor.</p> 
<h2><strong>How much salt do you need?</strong></h2> 
<p>You can survive on as little as 200mg of sodium per day but the average 
diet in New Zealand contains 10-20 times this amount. Sodium occurs naturally 
in foods, so we don't need to add extra.</p> 
<p>The New Zealand Guidelines Group recommends that New Zealanders reduce 
their sodium intake to less than 2,300mg a day. This is equal to 6g of salt a 
day, or just over 1 teaspoon of salt.</p> 
<p>Iodised salt is the main source of iodine in our diet. Iodine is a mineral 
needed for making important thyroid hormones. Inadequate iodine intake can 
result in goitre (an enlarged thyroid gland) among other health effects. New 
Zealand soils are naturally low in iodine.</p> 
<p>Most commercially processed food and takeaways use plain, non-iodised salt 
so remember to use iodised salt when you do use salt.</p> 
<h2><strong>How can you tell how much sodium is in foods?</strong></h2> 
<p>Sodium is listed on the food packet in the nutrition information panel. You 
may be surprised to see the difference in sodium levels between different 
brands.</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Aim for no more than 2,300mg sodium in total each day</li> 
<li>Choose breads and cereals with less than 450mg sodium /100g </li> 
<li>Choose spreads with less than 400mg sodium/100g</li> 
<li>Limit high salt seasonings such as stock cubes to once per day.</li> </ul> 
<h2><strong>7 tips to reduce your salt intake </strong></h2> 
<ol> 
<li>Remove the salt shaker from your table. Learn to taste before you shake. 
</li> 
<li>Gradually reduce the amount of salt you use in cooking. &nbsp;Research 
shows manufacturers can reduce the salt content of bread by 10% without 
changing the taste at all. So small changes over time will have a big impact. 
It takes about a month for taste buds to adjust to less salt.</li> 
<li>If using salty ingredients like ham, bacon, stock, soy sauce, olives, 
anchovies or cheese, leave out any extra salt.</li> 
<li>If your recipe includes salt, start by using half the amount suggested in 
the recipe and work towards reducing it further as the weeks go by.</li> 
<li>Buy salt-reduced products such as salt-reduced stocks, low salt soy sauce 
e.g. Kikkoman, and low salt tomato sauce.</li> 
<li>Enhance the flavour of meals with these ingredients instead of salt: 
herbs, spices, curry, lemon or lime juice or rind, mustard, chilli, nuts, 
horseradish, garlic, ginger, pepper or highly flavoured foods such as pesto, 
pickles and low sugar sauces.</li> 
<li>Eat fresh food such as fruit and vegetables, meats, chicken, fish, beans, 
raw nuts, seeds and milk products instead of commercially prepared foods.</li> 
</ol> 
<h2><strong>Preparing kai</strong></h2> 
<p>Be creative with your tastes! To avoid adding salt to meals try the 
following:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>When preparing kai such as a boil up or stew, add onions, garlic, and 
herbs or sauce for extra flavour instead of salt</li> 
<li>Use a variety of different herbs and spices to add flavour to vegetables.
</li> </ul> 
<p>Leonie Matoe, Te Hotu Manawa M&#257;ori</p> 
<h2><strong>Reducing salt in Pacific food</strong></h2> 
<p>Povi-masima, corned brisket marinated in salt, is a food that increases the 
risk of obesity and diabetes for many Pacific people. It is fatty and literally 
thick with salt and many people eat it every day as well as on special 
occasions.</p> 
<p>Povi-masima is not seen in any country outside the Pacific and it is not 
good for our health. The government needs to stop butchers producing this food 
that plays a role in making our people sick, or at least limit the amount of 
salt and fat that is allowed in each bin.</p> 
<p>You can still eat some corned beef. Use Wattie's tinned low fat and low 
salt corned beef instead of the povi-masima.</p>

<h1>Why doesn't Diabetes New Zealand promote low carbohydrate diets?</h1> 
<p>'<em>I've followed a low carbohydrate diet for a few months and my blood 
glucose levels have never been better. I used to eat 10 slices of bread each 
day but now fill up on protein and fat instead. I feel full for longer without 
the high blood glucose levels I once had. My daughter is also finding this a 
helpful way to control her weight. Why doesn't Diabetes New Zealand promote low 
carbohydrate diets?</em>' New Zealand registered dietitian <strong>Alison Pask
</strong> answers.</p> 
<p>Eat some carbohydrate but not too much</p> 
<p>This is a logical question. After all, foods containing carbohydrate 
convert to glucose and this increases your blood glucose levels after a meal.
</p> 
<p>So the fewer carbohydrates, the lower the blood glucose levels. </p> 
<p>However, it is important to look at the big picture. Severely restricting 
carbohydrates means giving up foods that are major sources of important 
nutrients.</p> 
<h2>Carbohydrate foods </h2> 
<p>As well as in bread, carbohydrate is found in cereals, rice, legumes, 
pasta, starchy vegetables, milk products and fruits which provide specific 
vitamins, minerals, fibre and antioxidants.</p> 
<p>Eating more protein and fat may increase your risk of heart disease in the 
long term. Should you choose to continue this pattern of eating, I recommend 
asking your doctor to monitor your cholesterol.</p> 
<p>It's also wise to visit a dietitian to ensure you are receiving adequate 
nutrients for good health.</p> 
<h2>Eat some carbohydrate but not too much </h2> 
<p>Take a close look at the foods you are eating now. Is it really a low 
carbohydrate diet or is it simply lower than what you were previously eating?
</p> 
<p>Perhaps you used to eat too much carbohydrate. Many people could benefit if 
they ate less. Carbohydrate restriction is necessary for people with diabetes 
and you need to establish the amount with your health care team.</p> 
<p>Recent research shows low carbohydrate diets do help some people to lose 
weight in the short term. However, after one year the benefits are no different 
than for those who have used more conventional weight loss diets.</p> 
<p>There are some risks involved with low carbohydrate diets and they are 
certainly not recommended for growing children. When it comes to weight loss, 
it's the long term weight loss and maintenance that are important rather than 
how quickly or how much weight is lost initially.</p> 
<h2>Some general guidelines</h2> 
<ul> 
<li>Ask your dietitian to help you establish the recommended amount of 
carbohydrate for your own personal needs. This will depend on your weight, 
activity levels, medication, medical history and your overall diabetes control.
</li> 
<li>You may find it helpful to start counting the grams of carbohydrate you 
eat at each meal. Carbohydrates can quickly add up if you don't take note of 
what you are eating.</li> 
<li>Spread your carbohydrate foods evenly throughout the day.</li> 
<li>Eat smaller portions. Simply eating less can improve your blood glucose 
levels.</li> 
<li>Be physically active. The more you move the less insulin your body 
requires.</li> </ul> 
<h2>To summarise</h2> 
<p>You can improve your blood glucose level by:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Eating a variety of wholegrain and unprocessed foods</li> 
<li>Balancing the amount of carbohydrate you eat throughout the day</li> 
<li> Being physically active</li> 
<li>Taking your medication as prescribed</li> 
<li>If you are overweight, small weight losses can lower your blood glucose by 
reducing your insulin resistance.</li> </ul> 
<p>A low carbohydrate diet may work for some people. However, such a diet 
needs to be carefully managed and is not the answer for most people with 
diabetes.</p>

<h1>Are light or lite products better for you?</h1> 
<p>Are foods labelled 'light' or 'lite' better choices for people with 
diabetes?<strong>Alison Pask</strong>, a New Zealand registered dietitian, 
highlights some products labelled light or lite and explains why you should be 
aware.</p> 
<h2>Confusing terms</h2> 
<p>A walk through the supermarket reveals how confusing these terms are and 
how food manufacturers use light or lite in a variety of ways.</p> 
<p>Light or lite has a variety of meanings. The label may mean one of the 
following or perhaps even a combination of these: less energy; less fat; less 
sugar; less salt.</p> 
<p>Light or lite may even refer to the colour of the food, that is, a lighter 
shade. It doesn't stop there - it may weigh less, meaning it&rsquo;s lighter in 
weight.</p> 
<p>To make shopping easier:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Any claim made on a label must be explained somewhere on the packet, so 
look to find the explanation</li> 
<li>Check out all the ingredients listed</li> 
<li>Read more details about the nutrition content on the Nutrition Information 
Panel</li> 
<li>Don't be fooled into thinking it's okay for you just because it's light or 
lite - check products out with your own dietitian if in doubt.</li> </ul> 
<p><strong>Rizzoli Extra Light Olive Oil</strong> is 100% olive oil with a 
light colour.<strong>Lupi Extra Light Olive Oil</strong> has an extra mild 
flavour.&nbsp; Both oils have as much fat and energy as any other oil.<br>
</p> 
<p><strong>Wattie's Tomato Sauce Lite </strong>contains 39% less sodium (salt) 
and 37% less sugar than Wattie's standard tomato sauce. But<b>Gregg's Lite 
Tomato Sauce</b> has only 25% less salt than Gregg's standard tomato sauce and 
no reduction in sugar. The Nutrition Information Panel reveals Gregg's Lite has 
170mg sodium per 100g while Wattie's Lite contains over three times this at 
540mg per 100g. The sugar content for the two brands is similar with one 
tablespoon of sauce providing less than 3.5g sugar. A wide range of lite salad 
dressings and mayonnaises is available. It is likely these dressings contain 
less fat than the standard product but watch out for the sugar and salt 
content. Just because they are low in fat doesn't mean they won't contribute to 
weight gain.</p> 
<p><b>Eta lite &amp; free Honey Mustard Dressing</b> is 99% fat free but 
contains 32% sugar. There are more appropriate choices for people with diabetes 
so don't select your dressing just on how much fat it has.<br>
</p> 
<p><b>Kraft Light peanut spread</b> contains 25% less fat than regular Kraft 
peanut butter. While this sounds good, be aware it also contains added salt and 
sugar. Two tablespoons add an extra 15g of carbohydrate. This may be enough to 
push your blood glucose over recommended levels. Read the label carefully and 
choose a peanut butter without added sugar.<br>
</p> 
<p><b>Hubbards Fruitful Lite Muesli</b> has 50% less fat than Fruitful 
Breakfast and is also high in fibre. But check the list of ingredients for 
cereal to see if there is added sugar. This product has brown sugar and honey 
as well as 20% dried fruit resulting in a total sugar content of 25.2g per 
100g. All breakfast cereals contain carbohydrate so count them towards your 
total carbohydrate eaten.<br>
</p> 
<p>Some muesli bars are labelled lite. <b>Leda nutrition 98% fat free lite bar
</b> contains 30g carbohydrate per bar of which 21.5g is sugar. Each bar 
provides 674KJ (161Kcals).<br>
</p> 
<p><b>Wattie&rsquo;s lite with peaches</b> <strong>no added sugar</strong> are 
a good choice. They are sweetened with artificial sweetener but there is some 
natural sugar found in the peaches themselves. The Nutrition Information Panel 
shows this to be 4.2g per 100g.<b>SPC Sliced Peaches in lite juice</b> are 
sweetened with fruit juice. While fruit juice does contain some natural sugar, 
the product has 25% less energy than fruit in a light syrup. 100g of this 
product contains 7.5g sugar.<strong> Wattie&rsquo;s fruit salad in light syrup
</strong> is sweetened with some sugar resulting in 14.2g sugar per 100g.</p> 
<p>Many chippies are labelled light. These <strong>Pringles Light</strong> 
contain 33% less fat than the standard product, but they still contain 25% fat 
- that&rsquo;s one quarter fat. They also contribute carbohydrate and salt, so 
eat only in small quantities occasionally when your blood glucose is well 
controlled.<b> Just Juice Bubbles lite</b> is a mix of half Just Juice and half 
diet lemonade. It has too much sugar for someone with diabetes. A 250ml glass 
provides over three teaspoons of sugar.</p>

<h1>Diabetes and dietary supplements</h1> 
<p>Vitamins, minerals, herbs &ndash; just some of the extensive range of 
dietary supplements available without prescription. What is the evidence for 
the need for dietary supplements? What effects may they have on your diabetes?
<b>Elizabeth Stewart</b> from the Institute of Food Nutrition and Human Health 
at Massey University provides some answers.</p> 
<p>You'll find a guide to healthy food choices in this In&#257; te kai ora/ 
Here's Healthy Food pamphlet</p> 
<h2>What are dietary supplements?</h2> 
<p>Dietary supplements include herbal medicines, homoeopathic medicines, 
traditional medicines, aromatherapy products, vitamins and minerals. They may 
also be called complementary medicines or therapeutic products.</p> 
<p>There is currently no requirement in New Zealand for dietary supplements to 
undergo any independent scrutiny of quality and safety. In the future, product 
standards are likely to be covered under joint Australia and New Zealand 
healthcare and therapeutic products legislation.</p> 
<p>Some reasons people give for taking supplements:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>I don't always eat properly so it's to make sure I get everything I need
</li> 
<li>The soil is deficient in essential minerals</li> 
<li>I was told it would cure my 'slight' diabetes</li> 
<li>They can't hurt me and they may do some good.</li> </ul> 
<h2><strong>How can taking supplements affect diabetes?</strong></h2> 
<p>A recent study showed that nearly one-third of people with diabetes use 
alternative remedies. Most do not openly tell their health professionals they 
use these therapies.</p> 
<p>Although supplements may appear to be 'natural', this does not mean they 
are suitable to take if you have diabetes. Recent studies for supplements you 
can purchase over the counter show:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Chromium - studies have failed to show any significant benefit for blood 
glucose levels</li> 
<li>Vanadium - there is no evidence of improved blood glucose levels</li> 
<li>Glucosamine - may boost blood glucose levels or worsen insulin resistance
</li> 
<li>Echinacea - could make auto-immune diseases such as Type 1 diabetes worse 
by affecting the immune function</li> 
<li>Omega-3 Fatty Acids (fish oil capsules) - may lower triglycerides in 
people with diabetes but slightly raise LDL cholesterol (the 'bad' cholesterol)
</li> 
<li>Large placebo-controlled trials of antioxidants e.g. vitamins C and E, 
beta carotene and other carotenoids, have failed to show benefits and in some 
instances have suggested adverse effects</li> 
<li>The role of vitamins B1, B6 and B12 in treating diabetic neuropathy has 
not been established.</li> </ul> 
<p>Dangerous herbs and supplements you should never take include: chaparral, 
coltsfoot, comfrey, ephedrine (ephedra or ma huang), germander, jin bu huan, 
lobelia, phenylalanine, sassafras, L-tryptophan, yohimbe.</p> 
<p>There is no scientific evidence to suggest any long term benefits in taking 
dietary supplements. There is also potential for toxic results from taking 
excess doses and for adverse reactions with diabetes medications.</p> 
<h2><strong>What are some possible interactions with prescribed medications?
</strong></h2> 
<p>Some combinations of prescribed medications and dietary supplements can be 
harmful.</p> 
<ul> 
<li>If you are on a blood thinner such as warfarin or aspirin - increased 
bleeding can occur if you also take alfalfa, chamomile, evening primrose oil, 
feverfew, garlic, ginger, ginkgo biloba, ginseng or red clover</li> 
<li>St John's Wort interferes with antidepressants such as fluoxetine e.g. 
Prozac</li> 
<li>If you take diabetes medication - ginseng can further lower your blood 
glucose levels, possibly causing a low blood glucose level reaction</li> 
<li>If you take a drug that makes you sun-sensitive e.g. certain blood 
pressure medications - St John's Wort can worsen the sun-sensitivity</li> 
<li>If you take the heart drug digoxin or a thiazide diuretic (a class of 
drugs used for blood pressure) - dried aloe by mouth, cascara sagrada, senna or 
liquorice can cause low potassium levels.</li> </ul> 
<p>There is insufficient evidence to show over-the-counter dietary supplements 
are suitable for diabetes management. More research including long-term trials 
is needed to assess the safety and potential benefits of dietary supplements 
and other complementary therapies for people with diabetes.</p> 
<h2><strong>What should I do if I already take supplements?</strong></h2> 
<ul> 
<li>If in doubt, don't take it</li> 
<li>Tell your health care team about any supplements you take - your 
prescribed medications may need to be adjusted</li> 
<li>Discuss any supplements with your doctor, diabetes nurse or dietitian 
before trying them - it is not worth endangering your blood glucose levels and 
ultimately your health</li> 
<li>If you decide to use a supplement and notice any unusual effects, stop 
taking it and contact your health care professional</li> 
<li>Supplements cannot cure diabetes - the consequences of not following 
prescribed diabetes medication can be very serious and even life-threatening
</li> 
<li>If your doctor has prescribed a supplement, continue to take it as 
prescribed e.g. folate for preventing birth defects, calcium to reduce 
osteoporosis, iron for anaemia</li> 
<li>The food supply in New Zealand is safe and nutritious - use it to get your 
daily vitamin and mineral needs from natural food sources and a balanced diet.

<h1>The diet dilemma</h1> 
<p>With the huge array of diet and weight loss books and what seems like every 
celebrity in the world reporting on the diet that&rsquo;s worked for them, you 
may be feeling a tad mystified or even a little cynical. So what really works?
</p> 
<p>A safe and effective diet is based on a wide variety of foods.</p> 
<p>Yo-yo dieting or rapid weight loss followed by weight gain is not good for 
your body. This loss and gain cycle upsets the body&rsquo;s metabolism and can 
actually contribute to weight gain over time.</p> 
<p> Successful weight management is a life-long commitment to following a 
healthy lifestyle and means balancing food eaten versus activity and exercise 
levels. It&rsquo;s not always easy but small changes to add up over time and 
help you to achieve a weight you can maintain.</p> 
<h2> How do you spot a fad diet?</h2> 
<p> A safe and effective diet is based on a wide variety of foods from the 
four food groups, not just limited to certain foods, and will encourage a 
balance between diet and excerise. The four food groups are fruit and 
vegetables; breads and cereals; meat and meat alternatives; and milk and milk 
products.</p> 
<p> Beware if the diet:</p> 
<ul> 
<li> Lacks flexibility and doesn&rsquo;t allow for individual preferences</li> 
<li> Involves supplements and substitutes for real food e.g. powders or pills
</li> 
<li> Uses specific foods or restrictions on the time of eating</li> 
<li> Promises large, rapid weight loss</li> 
<li> Has a limited time span</li> 
<li> Doesn&rsquo;t include exercise</li> 
<li> Involves &lsquo;magic&rsquo; ingredients to aid weight loss</li> 
<li> Says you can eat as much as you like and still lose weight</li> 
<li> Offers a &lsquo;cure&rsquo; for disease</li> 
<li> Involves lots of one type of food e.g. ice-cream or beetroot<br>
</li> 
</ul> 
<h2>Below are some hints to help you watch your weight</h2> 
<ul> 
<li>Set realistic goals including a realistic weight loss target</li> 
<li> Make gradual changes to your eating habits</li> 
<li> Avoid fad diets</li> 
<li> Eat meals at regular times</li> 
<li> Do not skip meals</li> 
<li> Increase your physical activity. Aim for a regular routine, daily is 
ideal but anything is better than nothing</li> 
<li> Look for opportunities to add walking into your day and take the stairs 
where possible</li> 
<li> Aim to reduce your weight by 1kg a month. It doesn&rsquo;t sound like 
much but slow and steady is the key</li> 
<li> Learn the difference between thirst and hunger</li> 
<li> Serve the same meal for the whole family. Cooking separate meals 
isn&rsquo;t sustainable long term</li> 
<li> Reduce portion sizes, but it can help to bulk up the meal with low energy 
vegetables such as carrots, cucumber and tomatoes</li> 
<li> Learn what triggers your eating and find alternative activities e.g. go 
for a walk or phone a friend</li> 
<li> Avoid having foods in your cupboards that will tempt you</li> 
<li> Save high fat foods for special treats</li> 
<li> Choose foods high in fibre e.g. wholemeal breads, fruits and vegetables
</li> 
<li> Choose snacks carefully and resist the temptation to snack</li> 
<li> Hide visual clues to eating e.g. the biscuit jar</li> 
<li> Take time over your meals. Eat slowly</li> 
<li> Eat at the table and put your knife and fork down between each mouthful
</li> 
<li>Avoid eating standing up e.g. while preparing a meal</li> 
<li> Turn off the TV when eating</li> 
<li> Make an appointment with a dietitian to get individual advice.</li> </ul> 
<p> Remember it&rsquo;s better to make small permanent changes rather than 
dramatic ones that you can&rsquo;t maintain. If you have a bad day, just put it 
aside and start again and get back on track the next day. You CAN do it.</p>

<h1>Demystifying serving sizes</h1> 
<p>Our nutritional needs depend on many factors, including age and activity.
</p> 
<p>Generally a serving size is what can fit into the palm of an individual's 
hand.</p> 
<p>Food and nutrition guidelines have been developed by the Ministry of Health 
for different age groups in the population. These guidelines are recommended 
for all healthy family members, whether or not they have diabetes. However, 
your dietitian may adapt this information to suit your individual needs.</p> 
<p> The four main food groups are the basis for a healthy diet:</p> 
<ul> 
<li> Breads and cereals e.g. bread, rice, pasta, and noodles. These are the 
most important source of energy for the body and directly affect the blood 
glucose levels if you have diabetes.</li> 
<li> Meat and meat alternatives e.g. lean meats, skinless chicken, eggs, fish, 
seafood, nuts, dried beans, peas, legumes and seeds.</li> 
<li> Fruits and vegetables These are excellent sources of vitamins and 
minerals and fibre. They can be fresh, frozen or tinned and it&rsquo;s 
important to aim for a mixture of raw and cooked and to leave the skins on 
where possible. Aim for a wide range of different coloured vegetables.</li> 
<li> Milk and milk products These are important sources of calcium to keep the 
bones and teeth healthy. Choose lower fat milk and milk products such as trim 
milk and cottage cheese.</li> </ul> 
<p> The table below summarises the serving sizes as recommended in the food 
and nutrition guidelines.</p> 
<p>Generally a serving size is what can fit into the palm of an 
individual&rsquo;s hand. The bigger the body, the bigger the hand and therefore 
the bigger the serving required. This is a daily recommendation so at the end 
of each day you should have eaten the amount of servings recommended in the 
table.</p>

public health unit or ask your dietitian or health professional.</p> Fruit

<h1>The sweet taste of sugar: what are the alternatives?</h1> 
<p>In what is becoming a carb-conscious world, alternative sweeteners to sugar 
are gaining in popularity. How safe are they? What benefits do they have? Will 
they affect your blood glucose levels? Are they really as good as manufacturers 
lead us to believe? New Zealand registered dietitian<b>Janene Cooper</b> 
provides some answers.</p> 
<p>Aim to rely on natural sources such as fruit to give the sweetness desired.
</p> 
<p>Artificial sweeteners are either non-nutritive (they provide little or no 
energy) or nutritive (they supply energy).</p> 
<h2><strong>Non-nutritive sweeteners - providing no kilojoules (energy)
</strong></h2> 
<p>In New Zealand there are five common non-nutritive sweeteners (the figures 
in brackets are the additive numbers): Aspartame (951) sold as Equal; 
Acesulfame-K (950); Cyclamate (952) and Saccharin (954) sold as Sucaryl and 
Sugromax (saccharin and cyclamate mixed); and Sucralose (955) which is Splenda.
</p> 
<p>Features of these sweeteners:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Intensely sweet, but contain few or no kilojoules (energy) </li> 
<li>Do not affect blood glucose levels, so can be useful for people with 
diabetes</li> 
<li>Do not cause dental decay.</li> </ul> 
<p>You may need to experiment a little when using non-nutritive sweeteners in 
cooking for successful results.</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Splenda is the most suitable for cooking as it retains its sweetness under 
high temperatures</li> 
<li>Equal is best used where foods require a shorter cooking time, as it loses 
its sweetness when exposed to high temperatures</li> 
<li>Improve the bitter taste of Sucaryl or Sugromax by adding at the end of 
cooking.</li> </ul> 
<p>Follow the manufacturer's guidelines on the packet when substituting for 
sugar. Some manufacturers have recipes on their websites which you may find 
helpful.</p> 
<p>Despite safety concerns, there is no evidence to substantiate claims made 
against these sweeteners. However, saccharin and cyclamate are not recommended 
for children under 2 years old. Aspartame and sucralose are considered safer.
</p> 
<p>In pregnancy, aspartame, acesulfame-K and sucralose are considered safe. 
Saccharin and cyclamate are notrecommended for pregnant women.</p> 
<h2><strong>Nutritive sweeteners - providing kilojoules (energy)</strong></h2> 
<p>Nutritive sweeteners are called sugar polyols or sugar alcohols because of 
their chemical structure. However, they do not contain sugar or alcohol.</p> 
<p>Sorbitol (420), Mannitol (421), Xylitol (967), Lacitol (966), and Isomalt 
(953) are the common sweeteners of this type in New Zealand.</p> 
<p>Features of sugar alcohols:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Occur naturally in fruit and vegetables</li> 
<li>Provide sweetness but with fewer kilojoules (0.8 &ndash;12KJ/gram) than 
sugar (16KJ/gram)</li> 
<li>Absorbed more slowly and incompletely than sugar requiring little or no 
insulin for metabolism resulting in lower blood glucose levels</li> 
<li>Often used with a variety of other artificial sweeteners, with each 
contributing unique characteristics</li> 
<li>Used to sweeten confectionery, jams, baked products and jellies</li> 
<li>Do not cause dental decay</li> 
<li>May cause bloating, flatulence and diarrhoea when consumed in large 
quantities</li> 
<li>Approved by the World Health Organisation (WHO) and widely used throughout 
the world.</li> </ul> 
<p>Foods containing sugar alcohols but no sugar (sucrose) can be labelled 
'sugar-free'. However, this does not mean these foods will not raise blood 
glucose levels, as they may contain other ingredients which affect blood 
glucose.</p> 
<p>Many sugar-free products are also high in fat, up to 30%. 'Sugar-free' 
means exactly that: the foods are free of sugar but may contain sugar alcohols.
</p> 
<p>They are not always as healthy as their marketing may suggest. Read the 
nutrition information panel carefully, checking the total carbohydrate and fat 
content.</p> 
<h2><strong>Xylitol</strong></h2> 
<p>WHO classifies this sugar alcohol as totally natural and safe with no 
consumption restrictions. It is recommended for all ages, infants and in 
pregnancy.</p> 
<p>Xylitol has beneficial dental properties decreasing oral acidity. It has a 
low GI of 17, half the energy value of sugar and therefore fewer kilojoules, 
and has a minimal effect on blood glucose levels.</p> 
<p>The body adapts to Xylitol over a shorter period of time than other sugar 
alcohols, so gastrointestinal discomfort is less likely. You can use it in 
cooking 1:1 for sugar.</p> 
<p>Dentasweet, marketed by Annies, is 100% pure natural Xylitol extracted from 
rice husk. Unfortunately, the cost means it is an expensive substitute for 
sugar.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
<h2><strong>Fructose</strong></h2> 
<p>Fructose is the natural sugar found in fruit and berries.</p> 
<ul> 
<li>It is 1.5 times sweeter than sugar so you can use smaller amounts</li> 
<li>It has the same energy value as sugar but a lower glycaemic index (GI) of 
19 (sugar GI is 61)</li> 
<li>It is absorbed slowly, requiring smaller amounts of insulin</li> 
<li>If used in large amounts it may affect triglycerides and LDL cholesterol
</li> 
<li>It can be used as a table sweetener, in baking and in cooking. But it is 
more often used in manufactured products, for example, confectionery, baked 
products and fruit drinks.</li> </ul> 
<p>Penfold&rsquo;s Sweetaddin, which is 100% fructose, is promoted as tasting 
like sugar with a similar texture but some people do not find the taste 
comparable.</p> 
<p>Fructose has an advantage when using it in food like meringues which 
require a great quantity of sugar. With fructose, you could use less and 
therefore decrease the kilojoules.</p> 
<h2><strong>Honey or sugar?</strong></h2> 
<p>Honey has more carbohydrate and kilojoules than sugar, but is sweeter so 
</p> 
<p>you use less. It also has a lower average GI, but this does depend on the 
nectar the bees have fed on.</p> 1 Tablespoon Carbohydrate (g) Kilojoules GI 
<br> Honey 17 277 average 55 <br>
Table Sugar 12 198 61 <br>
<br>
<br>

<p>You will not gain any nutritional advantage by using honey in preference to 
sugar. It is okay to use a teaspoon on unsweetened porridge but it is important 
to allow for the extra carbohydrate, as you must do when using honey in any 
cooking.</p> 
<p>Sugar is now considered more acceptable for people with diabetes when used 
in small amounts as part of a healthy meal plan. Sugar provides no fibre, no 
nutritional value, and can contribute to weight gain and poor diabetes control 
if used in excessive amounts.</p> 
<h2><strong>That sweet taste</strong></h2> 
<ul> 
<li>Use a variety of different sweeteners rather than relying on one type</li> 
<li>It is possible to retrain your taste buds to enjoy the taste of food with 
less sweetness</li> 
<li>Aim to rely on natural sources such as fruit to give the sweetness desired 
and gain greater nutritional benefits</li> 
<li>Always count sugar and fruit as part of the total carbohydrate eaten.</li>

<h1>Coeliac disease: Healthy living with a gluten free diet</h1> 
<p>Coeliac disease is an increasingly common disorder, with many of us knowing 
someone affected.<strong>Naomi Johnson</strong>, a New Zealand registered 
dietitian in the Human Nutrition Department at the University of Otago, 
explains what coeliac disease is and how to have a healthy, well-balanced diet 
if you have the condition.</p> 
<p>Try making gluten free muesli from rice flakes, rice bran, dried fruit, 
nuts and seeds.</p> 
<h2>What is coeliac disease?</h2> 
<p>People with coeliac disease (CD) have a physical intolerance to gluten, 
causing inflammation and damage within the small intestine. This leads to 
nutrients not being properly absorbed and a diverse range of symptoms.</p> 
<p>People may experience bloating, diarrhoea, abdominal pain, mouth ulcers, 
weight loss, period irregularities, iron deficiency, fatigue, and folate and 
B12 deficiencies. Children may suffer delayed growth.</p> 
<p>People with both diabetes and coeliac disease may have recurrent 
unexplained hypos and below optimum blood glucose control. Make sure you get 
individual advice from a dietitian who will ensure you receive a balance of 
vital nutrients.</p> 
<p>Coeliac disease is diagnosed with a small bowel biopsy to assess the extent 
of damage in the small intestine. An increasing number of people believe they 
are 'gluten-sensitive', but rather than visiting their doctor, some just change 
to a gluten free (GF) diet.</p> 
<p>It is important that people are properly diagnosed to determine if changes 
to their diet are required and to get the appropriate treatment, information 
and monitoring. Once diagnosed, you are entitled to join the Coeliac Society 
and receive subsidies on certain food items.</p> 
<h2>Achieving balance</h2> 
<p>With coeliac disease, you must follow a lifelong gluten free diet by 
excluding wheat, rye, barley, oats and their derivatives.</p> 
<p>This means you cannot eat most everyday breads, cereals, biscuits, pastas 
and processed foods.</p> 
<p>Obtaining sufficient energy, fibre and carbohydrate can be a challenge. But 
by making some small changes to the foods you eat, you can have a healthy, 
well-balanced, varied, fibre-rich diet.</p> 
<h2><strong>Tips and hints for meals</strong></h2> 
<p>You can make many mainstream meals by substituting GF products for standard 
items. In supermarkets, you can often find GF foods in the health food aisle.
</p> 
<p>GF foods available include bread, crackers, flour, baking powder, icing 
sugar, soy sauce, sausages and baked beans (Watties Lite) and hot cereals for 
winter. Orgran, Healtheries and Freedom Foods have ranges of rice or corn pasta.
</p> 
<p>To plan your meal, first choose your carbohydrate portion e.g. rice or GF 
bread, cereal or pasta. Potato, kumara and corn are also GF.</p> 
<p>Read all food labels to ensure there is no wheat, rye, barley or oats 
listed. But what about undefined 'starch' or 'thickener'?</p> 
<p>Maize or cornstarch is fine but if the content is not clear, cast aside. 
Anything with malt (from barley) including many beers is also off the list.</p> 
<h2><strong>Breakfast suggestions</strong></h2> 
<ul> 
<li>GF toast with topping. Be aware: vegemite, marmite and promite contain 
gluten.</li> 
<li>Make GF cereal from rice or soy flakes and rice bran with dried fruit, 
nuts, seeds and linseeds.</li> 
<li>Fresh fruit, yoghurt and low-fat milk smoothie.</li> 
<li>Try buckwheat porridge. Soak 1/3 cup rinsed buckwheat in 3/4 cup boiling 
water overnight in a sealed container. Then top with fresh fruit, linseeds, 
sunflower seeds and almonds. Use artificial sweetener if desired.</li> </ul> 
<h2><strong>Ideas for main meals</strong></h2> 
<ul> 
<li>GF bread salad sandwich</li> 
<li>Medium baked potato with bean filling, and side salad</li> 
<li>Vegetable soup with GF bread roll</li> 
<li>Omelette with vegetables or beans</li> 
<li>Rice, bean, or rice noodle salad</li> 
<li>GF pasta with vegetable, lentil or tomato based sauce</li> 
<li>Rice paper wrap with a filling of salad and tuna or chicken </li> 
<li>White or brown rice stir-fry with vegetables and lean meat, chicken or fish
</li> 
<li>Make GF breadcrumbs and use for crumbing schnitzel or fish.</li> </ul> 
<h2>Ways to get adequate fibre</h2> 
<ul> 
<li>Have at least 3-4 servings <strong>each </strong>of vegetables and fruit 
each day and where possible leave on the skins</li> 
<li>Add dried or fresh fruit, nuts, whole or ground linseed and seeds to 
homemade GF bread, GF cereals and salads</li> 
<li>Use brown instead of white rice for stir-fries or rice salads</li> 
<li>Add vegetables, split peas, lentils, nuts, seeds and beans to soups, 
pastas, curries, GF bread, salads and casseroles</li> 
<li>Have at least one vegetarian meal per week with lots of vegetables and 
lentils, chickpeas or kidney beans</li> 
<li>Snack on plain popcorn mixed with a small amount of dried fruit, nuts or 
seeds, or a baked potato, rice crackers, corn thins or vegetable sticks with 
hummus</li> 
<li>Make a smoothie with low fat milk, banana and your favourite fruit.</li> 
</ul> 
<h2><strong>Eating out hints</strong></h2> 
<p>Call the restaurant in advance to discuss your diet and the menu with the 
chef. If friends ask you for a meal, let them know what you can and cannot eat.
</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Choose meat, chicken or fish that is not breadcrumbed or coated with flour
</li> 
<li>Check ingredients of marinades, sauces, gravies and condiments or ask for 
the dish without the sauce or dressing</li> 
<li>Check soup ingredients &ndash; avoid soups such as chowder and minestrone
</li> 
<li>For brunch, take your own GF bread and ask the staff to toast it</li> 
<li>For bring-a-plate functions, take food suitable for yourself</li> 
<li>Take a supply of rice or corn crackers &ndash; that way you won't go 
hungry.</li> </ul> 
<h2><strong>Who to contact?</strong></h2> 
<p>If you suspect that you have coeliac disease, contact your doctor for 
further information. Once diagnosed, your dietitian will provide you with 
expert advice on suitable foods.</p> 
<p>Juggling both diabetes and gluten free can be a challenge as many gluten 
free products aren&rsquo;t necessarily suitable for someone with diabetes e.g. 
gluten free muffins contain large quantities of carbohydrates. A careful 
balance is required.</p>

<h1>Summer day picnics</h1> 
<p>Dust off the picnic plates and have some fun. There's no better way to 
spend a sunny summer's day than having a spontaneous picnic.</p> 
<p>A refreshing lemon drink will help to beat the heat.</p> 
<p>Keep your picnic basket handy so it's easy to grab for last minute picnics. 
Whether it's in a park, at the beach or in your backyard - picnics are a lot of 
fun.</p> 
<p>The word picnic comes from the French <em>pique-nique</em>, meaning 'a 
fashionable social entertainment' with each guest bringing a contribution to 
the feast. In other words, &nbsp;<em>pique-nique</em> is a fancy way of saying 
'potluck'.</p> 
<p>The tradition of the potluck lives on at a good many of today's picnics. 
However, the word picnic has developed a much broader meaning, encompassing 
virtually any portable meal.</p> 
<p>While the 18th century French and English aristocracy enjoyed formal 
picnics with servants and chairs and table settings of fine china and crystal, 
modern Kiwi picnics are usually more casual affairs.</p> 
<p>A cardboard box full of the essentials is all you need. Ensure your food 
stays cool by adding in a frozen chilly pad or bottle of frozen water. There is 
a high risk of food poisoning if food is left sitting in the hot sunshine or 
inside a hot car.</p> 
<p>Ask a friend or two to meet you at your favourite picnic spot and take the 
opportunity to go for a walk together.</p> 
<h2><strong>Summer picnic ideas</strong></h2> 
<ul> 
<li>Toss potato, pasta or rice salads with red, green or yellow peppers - 
throw in some cherry tomatoes, zucchini and a handful of nuts for a rainbow of 
colour</li> 
<li>Brighten up left-over chicken by turning it into a salad with plenty of 
fresh lettuce, herbs, and chunks of fresh seasonal fruit e.g. peaches or 
apricots</li> 
<li>Top any green vegetables with a herb vinaigrette or yoghurt dressing - 
it's best to serve the dressing separately</li> 
<li>Tuck favourite sandwich fillings into Italian focaccia bread or pita bread 
- layer with strips of cheese and tomato slices, sprinkle with fresh herbs and 
drizzle with balsamic vinegar and olive oil</li> 
<li>A selection of nuts is a great addition to any picnic - add to a salad or 
sandwich or eat as accompaniments to any meal</li> 
<li>Summer berries add special touch to a picnic for dessert.</li> </ul> 
<h2>Couscous salad</h2> 
<p>Couscous salad is a super quick meal to make for a picnic. Couscous needs 
no cooking; it is a precooked pasta that combines wonderfully with vegetables, 
meats and sauces.</p> 
<p>It's as simple as tipping boiling water over the grains and leaving to sit 
for five minutes before adding other ingredients.</p> 
<p>Combine 1 cup of each of the following: </p> 
<ul> 
<li>Cooked couscous</li> 
<li>Diced tomatoes</li> 
<li>Spring onions</li> 
<li>Fresh chopped parsley</li> 
<li>Cooked kidney beans or chick peas</li> </ul> 
<p>Combine with:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>1/4 teaspoon black pepper</li> 
<li>3 cloves crushed garlic</li> 
<li>3/4 cup lemon juice</li> 
<li>1/2 cup olive oil</li> </ul> 
<p>Serve either immediately or chilled. </p> 
<h2>Drinks</h2> 
<p>Remember to take plenty of fluids. While ice water is your best bet, the 
following ideas may beat the heat and add some fun.</p> 
<ul> 
<li>In a blender, puree chunks of summer fruits such as peaches, pears or 
nectarines, along with a tablespoon of lemon juice. Pour into ice cube 
containers and freeze until firm. Serve as ice cubes in chilled water.</li> 
<li>Add a couple of berries to a bottle of water for extra flavour. If you 
freeze the berries first they retain their shape for longer and add a delicious 
flavour. When limes and lemons are in season, slice them and freeze ready to 
slash into summer drinks when needed.</li> 
<li>Make a refreshing lemon drink with fresh fruit. </li> </ul> 
<h2>Refreshing lemon drink</h2> 
<p><em>Serves 5</em></p> 
<ul> 
<li>1 cup freshly squeezed lemon juice (4-5 lemons) </li> 
<li>1 cup freshly squeezed orange juice (3-4 oranges) </li> 
<li>3 1/2 teaspoons Equal Spoonful</li> 
<li>3 cups water</li> 
<li>Ice cubes</li> 
<li>Lemon slices</li> 
<li>Mint sprigs</li> </ul> 
<p>In a large jug, combine juices and Equal, stir to dissolve. Stir in water. 
Cover and chill.</p> 
<p>Serve over ice cubes. Garnish each serving with a lemon slice and mint if 
desired.</p>

<p>Summer doesn't get any better than a picnic in the sunshine. But before you 
head out into the heat, keep these tips in mind:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Freeze drinks the night before - not only will your drinks stay cold the 
next day, they'll help to keep your food chilled</li> 
<li>To keep your picnic comfortable, bring a blanket or chair to sit on and an 
umbrella to create some shade</li> 
<li>Set up your picnic in the shade</li> 
<li>Food spoils quickly in hot weather - be sure to keep your food cool with 
plenty of ice pads inside a chilly bin</li> 
<li>Throw away any food that's been sitting out for more than two hours</li> 
<li>Remember these essentials: insect repellent, sunhat, sunscreen, 
sunglasses, rubbish bag, sharp knife, and any medication you may need</li> 
<li>Take a good pair of walking shoes and wear a pair of beach shoes when in 
the water to protect your feet from sharp rocks or driftwood</li> 
<li>You may like to take a cricket bat and ball or a frisbee to throw around
</li> 
<li>Don't forget your togs and a towel.</li> </ul> 
<p>Enjoy the warmer weather and the taste of summer food while you can!</p>

<h1>Easter Tips and Edibles </h1> 
<p>Although it is important to eat the foods as described by your dietitian, 
you may remember being told a small treat is okay occasionally. As Easter comes 
only once a year, a treat of chocolate fits into the overall plan of following 
a healthy lifestyle.</p> 
<p>Consider non-food gifts as alternatives to chocolate.</p> 
<p>Moderation is always the key message when it comes to treats and special 
occasions. A small amount of normal chocolate is not a problem. Limit your 
intake to two small squares or one small hollow egg.</p> 
<p>Hot cross buns are a suitable alternative provided you eat only one or two. 
A low fat spread is better than butter but you still need to watch the quantity 
used. It can be deceptive how much butter you have used when it all melts into 
the bun, so be careful with the quantity.</p> 
<h2>Beware of diabetic chocolates</h2> 
<p>Diabetic chocolates are not the answer as an Easter gift for people with 
diabetes. Even though the chocolate is labelled suitable for people with 
diabetes, it still contains saturated fat. This fat isn&rsquo;t good for your 
heart. It is also high in calories, so it will contribute to weight gain.</p> 
<h2>Fun, non-food alternatives</h2> 
<p>Giving people with diabetes a little bit of chocolate at Easter is okay, 
but you could also consider non-food gifts. If you want to stick with Easter 
symbolism, there are many chick and rabbit soft toys and novelty gifts 
available.</p> 
<p>Of course, there are other ways to put a smile on people&rsquo;s faces 
besides giving gifts. It is early autumn and the weather is changing, so make 
the most of the holiday by getting outdoors, going for a walk, and spending 
quality time with family and friends.</p>

<h1>Plan ahead for Christmas</h1> 
<p> The mere mention of Christmas sends shudders down the spines of many 
people working hard to manage their diabetes. All that food &ndash; Christmas 
dinner, work functions, social gatherings, Christmas drinks and end of year 
wind-ups.</p> 
<p> Functions can be intimidating for someone who has done so well throughout 
the year. Good preparation and planning ahead can help avoid many of the 
pitfalls and reduce the stress involved with Christmas.</p> 
<p>Instead of a bowl of lollies, serve cherries or grapes</p> 
<p>Here are some tips to help maintain your eating habits during the festive 
season.</p> 
<h2>Aim for half a plate of vegetables</h2> 
<ul> 
<li>Follow the Diabetes New Zealand ideal plate model - this rule applies even 
on Christmas Day</li> 
<li>Summer is a great time for gardening and growing vegetables and fruit to 
eat</li> 
<li>Fresh herbs are popular in salads and nothing beats a salad prepared fresh 
from the garden moments before eating - remember to serve dressings separately
</li> 
<li>Put some lettuces into the garden for harvesting on Christmas Day</li> 
<li>Char-grilled vegetables are delicious &ndash; cooking them on the BBQ 
helps to save space in the kitchen</li> 
<li>Leave the skin on vegetables for added fibre.</li> </ul> 
<h2>Moderation is the key</h2> 
<ul> 
<li>Serve food on a smaller plate &ndash; it will look full with less food</li>
<li>Clear the table as soon as everyone has finished eating rather than being 
tempted by leftovers</li> 
<li>Try something different &ndash; how about a BBQ rather than a full roast 
meal?</li> 
<li>Use herbs and spices to flavour food rather than fat or oil</li> 
<li>Nibbles before a meal aren't necessary. However, if you do serve them, put 
them out when you need them rather than having them sit out all day to tempt 
you and others. See more about thehigh fat in snacks ... </li> </ul> 
<h2>Don&rsquo;t confuse thirst with hunger</h2> 
<ul> 
<li>Keep a jug of chilled water in the fridge</li> 
<li>Stock up on diet drinks when they are on special at the supermarket</li> 
<li>Prepare fancy ice cubes for fun drinks</li> 
<li>Freeze lemon or small pieces of fruit into ice cubes for added colour and 
flavour.</li> </ul> 
<p>See more on drinks and alcohol ... </p> 
<h2>Desserts aren&rsquo;t necessary</h2> 
<ul> 
<li>Save a dessert for a lighter meal rather than after a traditional 
Christmas dinner</li> 
<li>Fresh fruit such as freshly picked strawberries is a wonderful treat - 
take the grandchildren fruit picking before Christmas and make this a regular 
Christmas tradition</li> 
<li>Try fruit mixed with yoghurt and frozen - it's a delicious dessert</li> 
<li>Check your blood glucose levels to see if you can manage a small slice of 
cake</li> 
<li>Instead of a bowl of lollies, serve cherries or grapes.</li> </ul> 
<p>See more food suggestions for people with diabetes ... </p> 
<h2>Christmas is a great chance for some extra physical activity </h2> 
<p>With the best of intentions, the excitement of Christmas can cause stress. 
Physical activity can help to manage this:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Have a game of cricket with the family</li> 
<li>Go for a walk along the beach</li> 
<li>Take a ball to the park</li> 
<li>Give Christmas presents with physical activity in mind such as a ball, 
cricket set, volley ball net, paddling pool or new golf clubs.</li> </ul> 
<h2>Don&rsquo;t despair</h2> 
<p>In the stress of Christmas, remember to take your medication as directed 
and continue with your physical activity routine.</p> 
<p>If you do overeat, remember it is only one day. Jump back to your healthy 
eating habits the following day.</p> 
<h2>Top five Christmas gifts for people with diabetes</h2> 
<p>For those with diabetes, the prospect of watching others enjoying the 
delights of tasty but sugary Christmas cake can be a daunting one!</p> 
<p>But there&rsquo;s no reason why you can&rsquo;t treat yourself or a loved 
one with diabetes at Christmas. Take a look at these great gift ideas for 
people with diabetes:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Gift vouchers - if you're not sure what they want, let them choose! </li> 
<li>Pamper products - indulge with a selection of natural soaps, moisturisers 
and creams.</li> 
<li>Plants and flowers - encourage your loved ones to get outside and enjoy 
the summer sun, with sunscreen of course, with some plants and gardening tools. 
Gardening can be incredibly therapeutic, and even lower stress levels.&nbsp;
</li> 
<li>A pedometer - encourage that all important physical activity with a 
pedometer to help measure steps.</li> 
<li>Home baking - bake a Christmas cake suitable for people with diabetes as 
everyone loves a gift made with your own hands. See recipe forCelebration Cake 
... A rich fruitcake suitable for any special occasion.</li> </ul>

<h1>Christmas holiday eating tips</h1> 
<p> At the best of times it can be hard to resist the tasty treats in life but 
at Christmas it is even tougher. Christmas pudding and other sweet temptations 
can test those with the strongest of resolve!</p> 
<p>Enjoy healthy treats at Christmas</p> 
<p>The general advice for a healthy balanced diet is that it&rsquo;s best to 
limit treats and high fat takeaways to no more than once a fortnight.</p> 
<p>During the Christmas and New Year period, eating more sweets could result 
in higher blood glucose levels as well as you gaining some extra weight.</p> 
<p>A good thing to remember during the festive season is to check your blood 
glucose level before you decide to have a treat. If your blood sugar is already 
high, delay eating something sweet. You may also find that a sweet treat eaten 
with a meal in place of a dessert won&rsquo;t upset your blood glucose levels 
too much.</p> 
<h3>Plan ahead </h3> 
<p>A good way to make it through the holiday without any complications with 
your diabetes is to plan ahead. Think about what you&rsquo;ll be doing and 
where you&rsquo;ll be going to eat and drink, and check out the options 
beforehand.</p> 
<p>If eating out, choose a restaurant or caf&eacute; that serves a good 
variety of healthy options. You can also:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Ask for your salad with dressing served on the side, so that you can 
control the amount you put on</li> 
<li>Ask for your coffee to be made with trim milk</li> 
<li>Eat slowly - allow time to enjoy the taste of your food.</li> </ul> 
<p>During your holidays, remember to keep active. Balance your eating, reading 
and relaxing time with a good walk or other activity each day to get the blood 
pumping.</p> 
<h3><strong>Drinks tips</strong></h3> 
<ul> 
<li>Never swap alcohol for food</li> 
<li>Don&rsquo;t drink alcohol on an empty stomach</li> 
<li>Drink artificially sweetened drinks such as diet lemonade</li> 
<li>When drinking spirits, have them with water, diet drinks or soda water</li>
<li>When drinking beer, choose a low alcohol, &lsquo;lite&rsquo;, or low 
calorie variety</li> 
<li>Try a shandy &ndash; beer with diet lemonade &ndash; as an alternative.
</li> </ul> 
<p>See more on alcohol and diabetes ...</p> 
<h3><strong>Healthy Entertaining</strong></h3> 
<p>As Christmas is the season of goodwill, you can make sure your family and 
friends enjoy some healthy treats too. Try these:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Raw fruit platter</li> 
<li>Fruit kebabs</li> 
<li>Fruit loaf</li> 
<li>Wholegrain bread, fresh or toasted</li> 
<li>Low fat, high fibre crackers</li> 
<li>Popcorn - made without added butter</li> 
<li>Club sandwiches</li> 
<li>Raw vegetable sticks served with salsa or yoghurt dip. See recipes for dips
 ...</li> </ul> 
<p>See more on catering for people with diabetes ... </p> 
<h3><strong>Toppings for bread or crackers</strong></h3> 
<p>Good choices include:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Sliced tomato</li> 
<li>Low fat cheese</li> 
<li>Scraping of &lsquo;lite&rsquo; cream cheese</li> 
<li>Cottage cheese with herbs or gherkin</li> 
<li>Avocado and lemon juice or lemon pepper</li> 
<li>Thin spread of relish or pickle</li> 
<li>Tomato salsa</li> </ul> 
<p>Make your own pita crisps by cutting pita bread into shapes, split and 
spray with olive oil, sprinkle with garlic and paprika, and bake until crisp.
</p> 
<p>If you don&rsquo;t quite manage to follow through with your good intentions 
for healthy eating and being active, don&rsquo;t be fooled by going on a fad 
diet after Christmas. If you have diabetes,fad diets can be dangerous.</p> 
<p>Here&rsquo;s to a happy and healthy Christmas and New Year!</p>

</p> 
<h1>Wine, wisdom and diabetes</h1> 
<p>'Drink moderately, for drunkenness neither keeps a secret nor observes a 
promise.'<em>Cervantes,</em> Don Quixote. This wise advice from the 17th 
century reinforces modern health messages on alcohol. For those of us who 
choose to drink, it is useful to be aware of both the risks and the benefits of 
drinkingalcohol.</p> 
<p>It is easy to overestimate a standard drink - most wine glasses can hold 
almost two standard glasses when full.</p> 
<h2>How much alcohol should people with diabetes drink?</h2> 
<ul> 
<li>A maximum of two standard drinks per day (14 drinks per week) for women
</li> 
<li>A maximum of three standard drinks per day (21 drinks per week) for men.
</li> </ul> 
<p>The limits for women are lower than for men due to several differences in 
body function.</p> 
<h2><strong>What is a standard drink?</strong></h2> 
<ul> 
<li>300 mls of standard beer</li> 
<li>600 mls of reduced alcohol beer</li> 
<li>100 mls of wine</li> 
<li>30 mls (one pub measure) of spirits</li> 
<li>70 mls of fortified wine (sherry, port)</li> </ul> 
<p>It is very easy to overestimate a standard drink. Most wine glasses can 
hold almost two standard drinks when full. A 750ml bottle of wine provides 
approximately 7.5 standard drinks. A litre jug of beer holds slightly more than 
three standard drinks.</p> 
<h2><strong>Alcohol &ndash; the 'empty calorie'</strong></h2> 
<p>Alcohol is a poor source of almost all nutrients except energy. Heavy 
drinking actually causes extra losses of some nutrients in the urine. This 
explains why heavy drinkers who substitute alcohol for healthy food are prone 
to nutritional deficiencies.</p> 
<p>If you choose to drink but also need to lose weight, consider those extra 
calories. It would be wise to limit alcohol to weekends or special occasions, 
rather than the more liberal guidelines given above.</p> 
<h2><strong>Sugar content</strong></h2> 
<p>In the past, people with diabetes have been advised to avoid alcoholic 
beverages containing sugar, including beer. The sugar content of beer per 
100mls is quite low, but the amount of sugar and energy can soon add up if beer 
is consumed as one-litre jugs.</p> 
<p>The carbohydrate content (which includes remaining barley starch products 
and sugar) of some brands of beer may be higher than others. But without 
nutritional labelling, the consumer has no way of knowing.</p> 
<p>While a small amount of sugar can be included in the diet of people with 
diabetes, very sweet drinks such as sweet liqueurs are likely to be rapidly 
absorbed and are probably best avoided or consumed in very small quantities.</p>
<h2><strong>Risks and benefits</strong></h2> 
<p>For many people drinking alcohol is a normal part of social events and 
celebrations. Although most people with diabetes can enjoy a moderate amount of 
alcohol, it is important to understand the risks as well as the benefits.</p> 
<p>Alcohol can have both blood glucose lowering and glucose raising effects 
depending on how much is consumed, whether or not food is eaten at the same 
time, and whether or not alcohol is drunk on a daily basis.</p> 
<p>Alcohol can have additional blood glucose lowering effects in those who 
take insulin or some types of diabetes tablets.</p> 
<h2><strong>The good news about alcohol</strong></h2> 
<p>Drinking a moderate amount of alcohol with meals or snacks has no immediate 
effect on blood sugar levels in most people with Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes.</p> 
<p>There is also convincing evidence that 1-2 standard drinks per day will 
reduce the risk of heart attack and stroke. Some studies have suggested that 
red wine may be more protective than other alcoholic drinks due to its 
antioxidant content, but this remains to be proven.</p> 
<h2><strong>The bad news about alcohol</strong></h2> 
<p>Excessive daily drinking (4.5 standard drinks) has been shown to cause a 
rise in blood glucose levels in people with Type 2 diabetes. This is because 
excess alcohol interferes with the action of insulin.</p> 
<p>Excessive long term drinking can also raise blood pressure.</p> 
<h2><strong>Alcohol and hypoglycaemia</strong></h2> 
<p>If you take insulin or tablets, it's best to discuss alcohol use with your 
doctor or diabetes nurse educator. Alcohol can prevent the liver from making 
new glucose for many hours after drinking, which increases the risk of alcohol 
related hypoglycaemia, particularly for people taking medication.</p> 
<p>This can be dangerous because some signs of drinking too much, such as 
confusion or slurred speech, are similar to those of a low blood glucose level. 
Other people may not help you because they think you are drunk, and if you have 
been drinking, you may find hypoglycaemia more difficult to recognise. 
Treatment may then be delayed.</p> 
<p>Alcohol can also affect your body's ability to recover from hypoglycaemia 
and you may need to treat a low blood glucose reading more than once.</p> 
<h2><strong>Key points for safe drinking</strong></h2> 
<ul> 
<li>Never drink on an empty stomach &ndash; drink with a meal or snack 
containing carbohydrates</li> 
<li>Keep to the recommended limits for safe drinking</li> 
<li>Know your own limits</li> 
<li>Don't drink after exercise, particularly if you take insulin or tablets
</li> 
<li>Check your blood sugar before you go to sleep to see if it is falling, as 
alcohol can cause delayed hypoglycaemia during the night</li> 
<li>Eat a carbohydrate snack before going to bed, for example, a wholegrain 
sandwich.</li> </ul> 
<p>See more on food to serve with alcohol ... </p> 
<h2><strong>Wise drink choices</strong></h2> 
<p>Select drinks that are lower in alcohol and sugar, for example:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Mix a single nip of spirits with sugar free drinks such as diet soft 
drinks, soda water or sparkling mineral water, rather than choosing 'ready to 
drink' pre-mixed spirits of unknown sugar content</li> 
<li>Choose lower alcohol beers or try a shandy (beer and diet lemonade)</li> 
<li>Wine and sherry drinkers: choose quality over quantity and avoid the sweet 
stickies - red or dry white wines are good choices</li> 
<li>Non-connoisseurs can make cheaper wine last longer by making a spritzer 
(mix wine with soda water or sparkling mineral water)</li> 
<li>Liqueurs are best avoided as they are high in both sugar and alcohol 
content.</li> </ul> 
<p>It also helps to 'sip and savour', and to drink water or non-alcoholic 
beverages between glasses of alcohol.</p> 
<p><strong>Wendy Grylls</strong> <em>is a clinical and community dietitian. In 
association with the Department of Human Nutrition, University of Otago, Wendy 
completed a doctoral thesis which investigated the relationship between 
lifestyle factors and blood glucose control in older adults with diabetes.</em>

<h1>Suitable drinks for people with diabetes</h1> 
<p>Struggling to drink eight glasses of water a day? Not sure what's good for 
you when it comes to alternatives? Looking for a non-alcoholic option? Whatever 
your motivation, read on for no-nonsense, good drinking advice.</p> 
<p>Your aim: Start the habit today. Drink at least 6-8 cups of liquid each day.
</p> 
<h2><strong></strong></h2> 
<h2><strong>Water</strong></h2> 
<p>Water is the best choice of drink for your body. Add lemon, mint, or a few 
berries for extra flavour.</p> 
<p>Use straws, umbrellas, ice cubes containing items such as herbs, special 
fruits and attractive glasses to make drinks more interesting.</p> 
<h2><strong>Milk</strong></h2> 
<p>Choose a low fat milk. A calcium fortified milk such as Calci Trim is 
recommended for women, as it contains more calcium.</p> 
<p>Flavoured milk does contain some sugar but is also a good source of other 
nutrients such as protein and calcium. Just watch how much you drink.</p> 
<h2><strong>Avoid drinks high in sugar</strong></h2> 
<p>These include sports drinks, energy drinks, sweet cordials, sweet fizzy 
drinks, ordinary cordials and powdered drinks.</p> 
<p>In special circumstances, such as endurance exercise, your dietitian can 
provide extra guidance on the use of these products.</p> 
<h2><strong>No added sugar?</strong></h2> 
<p>Be cautious with fruit juices labelled 'no added sugar'. These drinks still 
contain natural sugars and some brands may have sugar levels similar to fizzy 
drinks. If you drink juice, dilute it at least 50/50 with water and limit the 
number of glasses you drink at one time.</p> 
<p>It's easy to drink large amounts of fruit juice and consequently large 
amounts of sugar without thinking about it. A drink may contain 10g sugar per 
100mls, but not many of us are satisfied with only 100mls.</p> 
<p>It's important to take note of the volume in each bottle. The nutritional 
information panel may give a serving size as 200mls, but a bottle may contain a 
lot more than one serving.</p> 
<p>Sugars are a form of carbohydrate and are included in the value for 
carbohydrates and are also listed separately on drink labels. The amount of 
sugar in the nutrition information panel will include naturally occurring sugar 
such as that found in fruit, as well as added sugar. Therefore, read labels 
with care.</p> 
<h2><strong>Diet drinks</strong></h2> 
<p>Not all diet drinks contain negligible amounts of sugar. Always check the 
ingredient list and nutrition information panel carefully.</p> 
<p>For example, one bottle of diet ginger beer contains 5.8g of carbohydrate. 
If you drink four bottles at a time, you have consumed over 23g of carbohydrate 
from your diet drink alone. One bottle, however, would be fine.</p> 
<h2><strong>Suitable drinks for people with diabetes</strong></h2> 
<ul> 
<li>Water</li> 
<li>Tea, including herbal teas</li> 
<li>Coffee</li> 
<li>Clear soup</li> 
<li>Diet or low calorie fizzy drinks such as Diet Sprite, Diet Ginger Ale</li> 
<li>Diet Refresh</li> 
<li>Soda Water</li> 
<li>Thriftee</li> 
<li>Diet Soda Stream</li> 
<li>Weight Watchers drinks e.g. Nutrachoc Chocolate drink, Weight Watcher low 
calorie drink flavours</li> 
<li>Baker Halls low calorie fruit drinks</li> 
<li>Barkers unsweetened blackcurrant juice</li> 
<li>Tomato juice</li> </ul>

<h1>The taste of coffee</h1> 
<p>The French start their day with a caf&eacute; au lait, the Italians with an 
espresso, and many New Zealanders kick-off the weekend with a bowl of latte. 
New Zealand Registered Dietitian<strong>Alison Pask</strong> gives some titbits 
about coffee, advice about caffeine, and a guide to the names on caf&eacute; 
blackboards and menus.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>When it comes to coffee, the key message is moderation</p> 
<p>Did you know coffee is like wine? The flavour is affected by where it is 
grown. Each region&rsquo;s coffee has its own unique taste, depending on 
factors such as rainfall, soil type and altitude.</p> 
<p>A cup of coffee can make you feel more alert without doing any harm. But if 
you find you need increasing amounts of coffee to get you through the day, 
perhaps you should think about another beverage &ndash; water comes highly 
recommended!</p> 
<p>Alternatively, it might be time for a review of your diet. Your body may 
need more carbohydrate for energy. Regular exercise will also help to boost 
your energy levels.</p> 
<h2>Coffee advice</h2> 
<ul> 
<li>Like most things that we love to consume, when it comes to coffee, the key 
message is moderation.</li> 
<li>Drinking coffee can sometimes be a habit. Does that sound like you? 
Perhaps you could go for a walk instead of drinking that extra cup of coffee? 
If you are thirsty, water is by far and away the best thirst quencher.</li> 
<li>Coffee contains caffeine and can cause sleeplessness, palpitations and 
tremors.</li> 
<li>Caffeine is a diuretic, which means it encourages the body to excrete 
water. This has been demonstrated in tests where a strong coffee has been shown 
to increase the amount of urine passed.</li> 
<li>However, there is also evidence to show that when consumed in moderation, 
the body gets used to the amount of coffee without affecting the water balance.
</li> </ul> 
<h2>What is a moderate coffee intake?</h2> 
<p>Three to six cups of instant coffee per day or one to two cups of freshly 
brewed coffee per day.</p> 
<h2>Tea &ndash; a healthier alternative</h2> 
<p>Tea, in comparison to coffee, is thought to be better for you. Tea contains 
flavonoids which act as antioxidants, which are known to protect from heart 
disease.</p> 
<p>The addition of milk doesn&rsquo;t appear to affect the flavonoids in the 
body. Tea also has less caffeine than coffee.</p> 
<h2>Caf&eacute; lingo</h2> 
<p>What do the different coffees on the caf&eacute; menu actually contain?</p> 
<p>All varieties start with a basic espresso made with 30mls water and 7-9g 
coffee.</p> 
<p><strong>Short black</strong>: a single shot of espresso made with 30mls 
water</p> 
<p><strong>Long black</strong>: a single shot of espresso topped with extra 
hot water</p> 
<p><strong>Flat white</strong>: a single shot of espresso topped up with 
steamed milk</p> 
<p><strong>Cappuccino</strong>: a single shot of espresso topped up with equal 
amounts of hot milk and foam</p> 
<p><strong>Latte</strong>: usually served in a big bowl, cup or glass and 
contains a double shot of espresso topped up with plenty of hot steamed milk 
and a little froth.</p> 
<p>Iced coffee made with cream and ice-cream could have up to 200 calories, 
not to mention the saturated fat. This is best left on the menu board. As an 
alternative, try an iced espresso or a coffee flavoured, low fat milk drink.</p>
<p>Adding sugar to your coffee is not recommended. Every teaspoon of sugar is 
an extra 5g of carbohydrate and another 20 calories. Ask for an artificial 
sweetener instead.</p> 
<p>It&rsquo;s a good idea to have some artificial sweetener in your wallet or 
handbag. Better still, enjoy the flavour of coffee without sweetener!</p> 
<h2>Coffee advice</h2> 
<ul> 
<li>Milky coffees such as lattes and cappuccinos can be higher in fat because 
they use more milk.</li> 
<li>If you are watching your weight, ask for trim milk to reduce the fat and 
calorie content.</li> </ul> 
<h2>Coffee titbit</h2> 
<p>To preserve the fresh flavour, store coffee in an airtight container, out 
of direct sunlight and in a cool, dark place. But not in the fridge!</p> 
<h2>Key points</h2> 
<ul> 
<li>Ask for trim milk</li> 
<li>Use artificial sweetener if necessary</li> 
<li>Limit daily consumption</li> 
<li>Look at drinking more water to quench thirst.</li> </ul>

<h1>The facts about sugar and diabetes</h1> 
<p>Someone may have told you that people with diabetes can't eat any sugar. 
Some people think that eating too much sugar causes diabetes in the first 
place. Such ideas make sugar sound like a 'bad guy'. But sugar is just a type 
of carbohydrate. New Zealand registered dietitian Alison Pask explains why a 
sugar free diet is no longer the norm for people with diabetes.</p> 
<p>Base your plate on the principle of quarter of a plate of meat or meat 
alternative, quarter of a plate of carbohydrate, and at least half a plate of 
free vegetables.</p> 
<p>Sugar (sucrose) is a carbohydrate that occurs naturally in foods. It is the 
major product of photosynthesis, the process by which plants transform the 
sun's energy into food.</p> 
<p>Sugar occurs in greatest quantities in sugar cane, from which it is 
separated for commercial use.</p> 
<h2><strong>What is the difference between sugars?</strong></h2> 
<p>The only difference between the types of sugar is the amount of molasses 
which remains on the crystal.</p> 
<p>So brown sugar is not more 'natural' than white sugar, it simply has a 
different flavour and colour due to extra molasses coating the sugar crystal.
</p> 
<ul> 
<li>White sugar is the most popular and widely used sugar - its high degree of 
purity means it has no additional flavour other than sweetness</li> 
<li>Caster sugar is the same as white sugar, but has a smaller crystal size
</li> 
<li>Icing sugar is granulated sugar ground to a smooth powder and then sifted; 
it contains about 3% cornstarch to prevent caking</li> 
<li>Golden syrup and treacle are produced by partly breaking down sugar into 
its components of glucose and fructose which stops crystals forming and creates 
a stable liquid product</li> 
<li>Honey is just as natural as sugar except it comes from a beehive rather 
than sugar cane.</li> </ul> 
<h2>What is the connection between sugar and diabetes?</h2> 
<p>Diabetes is a condition in which the body does not have the ability to 
effectively use glucose.</p> 
<p>Glucose in the bloodstream comes from carbohydrate foods, which are changed 
into glucose after we have eaten them.</p> 
<p>Glucose is a type of sugar and therefore people with diabetes often become 
confused about the amount of sugar, if any, they can include in their daily 
eating pattern.</p> 
<p>'Blood sugar' and sugar in food are not the same and this is what creates 
the confusion. It is important to note that sugar does not cause diabetes.</p> 
<h2><strong>A sugar free diet is no longer the norm</strong></h2> 
<p>Sugars and other carbohydrates are digested in our bodies and broken down 
into glucose.</p> 
<p>Glucose is essential to our bodies and is carried in the blood to supply 
fuel throughout the body. Diabetes is the result of a lack of insulin, or 
insulin not working effectively, which means that glucose in the blood cannot 
be used appropriately.</p> 
<p>Diets containing little or no carbohydrate (either as sugars or starchy 
foods) were the common form of treatment for diabetes before the invention of 
insulin. Advanced medical and nutritional research now allows us to be more 
liberal in the management of diabetes.</p> 
<p>Carbohydrates are important in the diets of people with diabetes. </p> 
<p>Until recently, scientists believed sugar was quickly digested and 
absorbed, resulting in blood glucose levels which climbed too high, too 
quickly. This resulted in sugar being regarded differently to other 
carbohydrates.</p> 
<p>As a result, people with diabetes were warned to consume little or no 
sugar. Research has proven this advice to be unfounded. When scientists 
actually measured the rise in blood glucose which occurs after eating sugar, 
they found it was similar to many breads and less than some foods such as 
mashed potato.</p> 
<p>Research has revealed that the way in which food acts in the body is far 
more complex than we once thought. Different carbohydrate-containing foods do 
have different effects on blood glucose levels, but we can now rate them on the 
effect they actually have in the body.</p> 
<p>This is where the glycaemic index or GI becomes a useful tool in the 
management of diabetes.</p> 
<h2><strong>GI in a nutshell</strong></h2> 
<p>The glycaemic index (GI) ranks carbohydrate-containing foods depending on 
the effect each has on blood glucose levels. This rating is now being used by 
many dietitians as a guide for developing healthy eating plans for people with 
diabetes.</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Foods are identified as: low GI slowly digested carbohydrates; moderate; 
and high GI quickly digested carbohydrates</li> 
<li>Higher GI foods are best eaten within a meal, ideally along with a low GI 
food, not as snacks or on their own</li> 
<li>Higher GI foods will cause blood glucose levels to rise steeply and quickly
</li> 
<li>Sugar, a moderate GI food, sprinkled on porridge which is a low GI food, 
will cause less of a rise in blood glucose than sugar sprinkled on a high GI 
food such as cornflakes</li> 
<li>Low GI foods should form the basis of each meal</li> 
<li>There is no reason for people with diabetes to avoid sugar in diets as it 
has a moderate GI. Of course, the amount eaten and the total carbohydrate of 
the food also play a part. That's why concentrated sources of sugar like sweet 
sugary drinks aren't recommended as it is easy to drink large volumes of these 
drinks, which certainly will impact on your blood glucose.</li> </ul>

<h2><strong>Including sugar in your diet</strong></h2> 
<p>Our better understanding of the way the body deals with sugar in foods 
means that people with diabetes no longer need to exclude sugar, provided it is 
included as part of the total carbohydrate content of a meal.</p> 
<p>To find out more about eating the right quantities of different foods</p> 
<p>If your diabetes is well controlled, you may be able to include sugar as 
part of a meal or into a snack. A small amount of sugar, that is, 1&ndash;2 
teaspoons per person, is generally okay. For example:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>A small amount of honey in a marinade for meat, or</li> 
<li>A teaspoon of jam on wholegrain bread, or</li> 
<li>The small amount of sugar in baked beans.</li> </ul> 
<p>When making muffins, a quarter of a cup of sugar in a recipe for 12 muffins 
is acceptable. Sugar will however add extra calories, so if you are watching 
your weight then the sugar will contribute to your total energy intake and will 
not add any other nutritional benefits.</p> 
<p>Using fruit for sweetness is a successful way to add extra taste and 
sweetness. However, count the fruit as part of the total carbohydrate eaten.</p>

tailor an eating plan for your own individual circumstances.</p>

<h1>Beware of high fat snacks</h1> 
<p> New Zealand registered dietitian <strong>Alison Pask</strong> explains 
what many of us already suspect. It is incredibly easy to consume a large 
number of calories simply by nibbling snacks throughout an entire evening.</p> 
<p>Did you know.... A big bag of chips has as many as 13 and a half teaspoons 
(67g) of fat.</p> 
<h2><strong>Beware of the fat</strong></h2> 
<p>It's no surprise that snack food is often high in fat. Remember, fat gives 
food flavour.</p> 
<p>So foods high in fat are often tasty and tempting. We need to retrain our 
taste buds to enjoy snacks with less fat.</p> 
<h2><strong>Did you know &hellip;.</strong></h2> 
<ul> 
<li>Some crackers can be high in fat. You may be surprised to see some 
crackers contain around 27% fat. Always read thenutrition information panel and 
aim to choose a cracker with less than 10g fat per 100g.</li> 
<li>Avocado is high in monounsaturated fat which is friendlier to your heart 
but still contains around 26% fat. It is therefore high in energy (calories). 
If you are trying to control your weight, limit avocado based dips and spreads 
to small quantities, for example, 1-2 tablespoons.</li> 
<li>Read the labels on dips to determine the fat content of each variety and 
flavour, as they can vary significantly. As an example, 'Lisa's Little Dips' 
vary in fat content from 5.3g fat per 100g for Haricot Hummus and Coriander, to 
up to 25g fat per 100g for Spicy Walnut.</li> </ul> 
<h2><strong>Chipped out</strong></h2> 
<p>Don't be fooled by chippies with healthy sounding names such as 'natural' 
or 'lite'.</p> 
<p>It is useful to remember chips are made from highly processed potatoes. If 
you eat a lot of chips containing quickly digestible carbohydrate, you may 
experience high blood glucose.</p> 
<h2><strong>Healthier alternatives that go the distance</strong></h2> 
<ul> 
<li>Eat a meal or healthy snack before going out.</li> 
<li>Choose small amounts e.g. one tablespoon, of raw or dry roasted nuts and 
seeds.</li> 
<li>Buy nuts in the shell as having to crack them open often slows down 
consumption.</li> </ul> 
<h2><strong>The host with the most</strong></h2> 
<p>Try these healthy alternatives at your next social get-together:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>A fresh fruit platter served with low fat yoghurt dips</li> 
<li>A vegetable platter with low fat dips such as cottage cheese or a tomato 
salsa</li> 
<li>A selection of sandwiches or low fat crackers with low saturated fat 
fillings such as tomatoes, cucumber, gherkin, olives, hummus, salsa, vegemite, 
low fat cheeses e.g. cottage or ricotta cheese, lean meat, pickles or relish.
</li> 
<li>Think about choosing delicious high fibre bread. There is a great 
selection at most supermarkets.</li> 
<li>Plain popcorn, pretzels, or mini low fat muffins make welcome 
alternatives. See recipe forsweetcorn and chive muffins ... </li> </ul>

<h1>Preserving fruits and vegetables without sugar</h1> 
<p>Autumn is a perfect time to preserve seasonal produce. Preserving can give 
you immense satisfaction and can also save you money. New Zealand registered 
dietitian<strong>Alison Pask</strong> gives us some tips on preserving fruits 
and vegetables without using sugar.</p> 
<p>Follow reliable recipes to safely preserve fruits and vegetables without 
sugar</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Preserving fruits and vegetables is very rewarding. If you grow your own 
fruits and vegetables, extend their seasons by preserving them.</p> 
<p>If you don't grow your own, wait until they are in season and plentiful, as 
you'll then pay the lowest price for your favourites.</p> 
<p>Recipes for preserving fruit usually contain sugar. However, you can 
produce a successful result without adding sugar. While sugar helps to hold the 
texture and retain the shape and colour of the fruit, it is primarily added for 
flavour.</p> 
<p>Sugar is not needed to prevent spoilage. You can safely preserve all fruits 
in water by following reliable recipes.</p> 
<h2><strong>Bottling </strong></h2> 
<p>Invented in 1809 by Nicholas Appert, a French confectioner, bottling is a 
process of preserving food by heating and sealing it in airtight containers.</p>
<p>The scientific principle behind bottling is simple. Food decay and spoilage 
are caused either by enzymes in the food itself or by bacteria and other 
micro-organisms.</p> 
<p>During the bottling process, the food is heated to a high temperature to 
stop the action of the enzymes and kill all organisms that cause decay. The 
food is then sealed in airtight containers to prevent contamination and to 
preserve it for long periods of time.</p> 
<h2><strong>Freezing </strong></h2> 
<p>You can freeze all fruits without adding sugar. Sugar is not needed for the 
preservation of frozen fruits, but it does help the fruit maintain quality for 
longer.</p> 
<p>Berries and fruits that do not darken when exposed to air such as cherries, 
plums, grapes, melon balls, pineapple chunks and rhubarb slices, are best 
frozen in single layers on trays, then packed into freezer bags or containers. 
Light-coloured fruits such as apples, peaches and apricots freeze well in 
liquid.</p> 
<p>Berries are some of the most flavourful and colourful fruits. Their season 
is often short, so if you do not have time to preserve them as jams, jellies, 
vinegars and syrups, simply freeze them for later use as they freeze well.</p> 
<p>When freezing any food, pack it to allow for 10% expansion as fruits and 
vegetables are mostly water and water expands when turning to ice.</p> 
<p>For soft herbs such as parsley, basil, tarragon and chives, chop finely and 
pack into ice-cube trays, top up with water and freeze. If you have lots to 
freeze, transfer to a plastic bag when frozen and then take out as and when you 
need them. You will find the herbs discolour during freezing but a certain 
amount of flavour remains.</p> 
<p>You can also freeze coarse herbs such as rosemary, sage and thyme. Strip 
the leaves from the stalk and pack into small plastic bags, extract the air, 
and freeze.</p> 
<h2><strong>Dry storing </strong></h2> 
<p>Fruits and vegetables store well without being preserved as long as they 
are kept in the right conditions. Apples and pears will keep for months if you 
choose unblemished fruit.</p> 
<p>Wrap each one in dry newspaper and place in a single layer in the bottom of 
a wooden crate or shallow cardboard box. Store in a dry, airy place.</p> 
<p>Vegetables like potatoes or beetroot also store well. For beetroot, cut off 
the leafy tops and place in a single layer in a wooden or cardboard box to dry.
</p> 
<p>Store potatoes in hessian or paper sacks; just remove any moist mud to 
prevent mould forming. Pumpkins last well when treated this way too. Store in a 
cool, airy, dark place.</p> 
<p>You can also store onions and garlic. Plait the leafy tops and then hang 
them up to dry in a dry place.</p> 
<p></p> 
<h2>General tips for preserving without sugar</h2> 
<ul> 
<li>Always use the best, top quality ingredients</li> 
<li>Preserve fruits and vegetables at their peak of ripeness &ndash; 
don&rsquo;t use over-ripe produce</li> 
<li>Use a reliable home-tested recipe </li> 
<li>Label jars and store in a cool dry dark place</li> 
<li>For best quality, use home preserved fruits and vegetables within 12 
months.</li> </ul> 
<h2>For something a bit different</h2> 
<ul> 
<li>Turn a traditional strawberry jam into something special with the addition 
of chilli or a splash of balsamic vinegar</li> 
<li>Spice up pickled onions with Thai spices</li> 
<li>Combine different fruits to make an interesting jelly.</li> </ul> 
<p>If you don't have a food dehydrator try oven-drying - a fantastic way of 
making the most of too many tomatoes, chillies, aubergines and even apples or 
pears, although it isn't very energy efficient.</p> 
<p>Place sliced food in a single layer on a rack or tray in a warm oven (65 
degrees Celsius) for 3-10 hours. The time will depend on the item you are 
drying. Leave the oven door ajar to allow air movement to carry the moisture 
away. Turn the food regularly to ensure even drying.</p> 
<h2>Carbohydrate portion</h2> 
<p>Sugar free jams and jellies and preserved fruits and vegetables will 
contain the carbohydrate that is naturally present in the fruit or vegetable.
</p> 
<p>This means you need to count the portion towards your overall carbohydrate 
intake of each meal.</p> 
<h2><strong>Using artificial sweeteners</strong></h2> 
<p>Sweet relish and pickle recipes do not adapt as well to sugar free 
processes as do plain fruits. Try recipes that call for artificial sweeteners, 
but don't be too discouraged if some batches are disappointing.</p> 
<p>Sugar helps in gel formation, serves as a preserving agent, and contributes 
to the flavour of jams and jellies. It also has a firming effect on fruit, a 
property useful in making preserves.</p> 
<p>You can make satisfactory jams and jellies without added sugar but they 
tend to resemble gelatin fruited desserts rather than true jams or jellies. 
Carefully follow recipes and processing times for each recipe.</p> 
<p>Check the labels of the artificial sweetener you have chosen as some work 
better than others when it comes to preserving. Don&rsquo;t use a sweetener 
which goes bitter when heated such as saccharine or aspartame. If you desire, 
add artificial sweetener just before serving to avoid the heat destroying the 
sweetness.</p> 
<p>Commercially prepared low sugar food is costly because the quantity handled 
is small and production procedures are slightly different from those for 
conventionally preserved foods.</p> 
<p>Preserving food at home can be a practical way to save money if you have 
fresh produce and the necessary equipment available. Make the most of seasonal 
produce by reaping the benefits of your preserving throughout the year.</p>

<h1>The health benefits of nuts</h1> 
<p>Although rates of cardiovascular disease (CVD) are declining in many 
developed countries, it remains the number one cause of death. In developing 
countries, CVD rates are increasing.</p> 
<p>People with diabetes are two to four times more likely to develop CVD than 
people without diabetes. The prevention and treatment of CVD by diet is an 
important issue both for people with diabetes and those without. Dr Alexandra 
Chisholm explains the benefits of eating nuts as part of a healthy balanced 
diet.</p> 
<p>Adding nuts to the diet can help to lower blood cholesterol levels.</p> 
<p>Nuts are grown all over the world. They are an intrinsic part of 
traditional dietary patterns in many regions where both blood cholesterol 
levels and the incidence of heart disease are low.</p> 
<p>A small serving of nuts four to five times per week has been observed to 
reduce the risk of CVD in population studies.</p> 
<p>Intervention studies have shown that the addition of nuts to the diet can 
help to lower blood cholesterol levels, reduce the oxidation of low density 
lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and improve a number of other indices related to 
CVD risk.</p> 
<h2>Cholesterol is a type of fat or lipid</h2> 
<p>As cholesterol is carried in the blood stream by particles called 
lipoproteins, a distinction is made between cholesterol carried by low-density 
lipoproteins (LDL cholesterol, or 'bad' cholesterol) and that carried by 
high-density lipoproteins (HDL cholesterol, or 'good' cholesterol).</p> 
<p>The level of total cholesterol is the sum of HDL and LDL cholesterol levels.
</p> 
<h2><strong>The Evidence - Epidemiology</strong></h2> 
<p>Initial evidence of the benefit of nut consumption has come from population 
studies which looked at the diets of large numbers of people over long periods 
of time.</p> 
<p>In four studies, the Adventist Health Study, the Iowa Women's Health Study, 
the Nurses' Health Study and the Physicians' Health Study, a total of over 
160,000 men and women were followed up for between six and 14 years.</p> 
<p>These studies showed very consistent indications for the health benefits of 
nuts. When compared with never eating nuts, the effect of eating small 
quantities of nuts (30g) four to five times per week or more was a reduction in 
CVD risk of between 18% and 51% (Kris-Etherton et al 2001).</p> 
<h2><strong>Intervention studies</strong></h2> 
<p>A number of studies have looked at the effect on blood lipids (fats) and 
lipoproteins of including nuts in the diet. Different population groups and 
both men and women have taken part in these research studies. The studies 
included participants with lipid levels in the normal range as well as those 
with hyperlipidemia (high levels of blood fat). The participants ranged in age 
from 18 to 81 years.</p> 
<p>In spite of this diversity in subject characteristics and study design, 
reductions of between 9% and 31% in LDL cholesterol were observed. The 
quantities of nuts consumed in the studies varied from 30g to 100g per day.</p> 
<p>Almonds, macadamias, pistachios, walnuts, pecans, and hazelnuts (tree nuts) 
have all been used in studies, as have peanuts, which are a legume 
(Kris-Etherton et al 2001).</p> 
<h2><strong>Studies including persons with diabetes</strong></h2> 
<p>Thirty volunteers with Type 2 diabetes took part in a recent study using 
almonds. Including almonds in the diet had no effect on glycaemia (blood sugar) 
but there was a drop in LDL cholesterol and a slight drop in high density 
lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. However, there was still a reduction in the 
ratio of total cholesterol to HDL cholesterol and in the ratio of LDL to HDL 
cholesterol.</p> 
<p>It is thought that these ratios reflect CVD risk from blood cholesterol 
levels. Their highly significant reduction in this study indicates the 
beneficial effect of eating almonds as part of a healthy diet (Lovejoy et al 
2002).</p> 
<p>Further research involving the addition of nuts to the diets of 
post-menopausal women with Type 2 diabetes is in progress.</p> 
<h2><strong>Studies relating to weight</strong></h2> 
<p>Nuts have often had a 'bad press', being regarded as a fatty food to be 
avoided by those trying to reduce or control their weight. Two recent studies 
have shown that the inclusion of nuts in the diet did not lead to weight gain.
</p> 
<p>One study added almonds and the other peanuts. The participants were not 
asked to make any other changes in their diets and did not know that the 
researchers were studying body weight (Fraser et al 2002; Alper &amp; Mattes 
2002).</p> 
<h2><strong>Include nuts in diet</strong></h2> 
<p>The health benefits of nut consumption, particularly their 
cardio-protective effects are often under-recognised. Nuts provide a 
concentrated and palatable source of essential unsaturated fatty acids, fibre, 
and a number of other nutrients often in short supply in the modern diet. They 
are filling and can thus be useful in helping to prevent weight gain, and 
provide a concentrated source for those needing additional energy.</p> 
<p>People with diabetes as well as those who do not have diabetes should be 
encouraged to include a small serving of nuts in their diet several times a 
week.</p> 
<p>See recipe for hot basmati rice, lentil &amp; cashew salad ... </p> 
<p><strong>Dr Alexandra Chisholm</strong> <em>is a lecturer and research 
dietitian in the Department of Human Nutrition, University of Otago, Dunedin, 
New Zealand.</em></p> 
<h2>In a nutshell</h2> 
<ul> 
<li>Nuts make a wonderful snack, particularly in place of foods like cakes or 
biscuits. The ultimate healthy 'fast food', they are easy to carry.</li> 
<li>Nuts are a good choice for a healthy fat exchange or a sustaining snack 
together with some carbohydrate.</li> 
<li>Getting as much variety as possible into your diet is important and this 
applies to nuts as well as other foods.</li> 
<li>To get the maximum benefit from eating nuts, it is important to make sure 
they are very fresh, and to keep them in a cool dark place (especially ground 
or chopped nuts).</li> 
<li>As they contain enough of their own fat, simply roast nuts by putting them 
in a shallow dish in the oven at a low to medium heat, stirring frequently, 
until they have the desired crunch. Don't add salt or other fats or oils.</li>

<h1>Make the most of your midday meal</h1> 
<p>We can be creatures of habit, having the same for lunch day after day, week 
after week, year after year. How about experimenting with some different 
lunches?<strong>Alison Pask</strong>, a New Zealand registered dietitian, 
suggests healthy choices to try at midday.</p> 
<p>Self-crusting Kumara and Broccoli Quiche</p> 
<p>Think about injecting some variety into your lunches as this will help you 
follow the healthy eating guidelines as suggested by health professionals.</p> 
<p>Making your own lunch is the only way to know exactly what you are eating. 
This will make sure your lunch doesn't contain any restricted items and will 
cost less than buying meals.</p> 
<p>It is worth taking time to prepare a suitable lunch. Don't fall into the 
trap of thinking you are too busy, have too many meetings or aren't hungry.</p> 
<p>Lunch is one of your main meals and eating at regular times is an important 
tool for managing your diabetes. You'll also find you have more energy and be 
more productive.</p> 
<h2><strong>Adding variety</strong></h2> 
<p>Consider using different breads such as pita, wholegrain, wholemeal, naan, 
sourdough, pumpernickel, rye, bagels or fruit bread.</p> 
<p>Freeze the bread and take out each morning. This way it stays fresh and you 
can vary your choice throughout the week.</p> 
<p>If you have access to a microwave, options include:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Baked beans</li> 
<li>Soup</li> 
<li>Leftovers such as stir-fry or casserole and vegetables</li> 
<li>Quiche (you can also eat this cold).</li> </ul> 
<p>Many liquid items will keep well in a thermos. This is great for people on 
the move such as truck drivers, plumbers, builders or salespeople.</p> 
<p>Sportspeople can also use a thermos to carry a hot lunch or snack. </p> 
<p>Freeze leftover meals in individual portions for lunches. Or make your 
favourite recipe and freeze it for reheating later. This also sets your portion 
size, preventing you from going back for seconds.</p> 
<p>Become the envy of your mates by having homemade baking. Make a batch of 
approved muffins or scones and freeze them. Each day, remove one from the 
freezer. It will thaw in your lunch box and not need reheating.</p> 
<h2><strong>Sandwiches</strong></h2> 
<p>Use your imagination to widen your range of sandwich fillings. Try cold 
lite baked beans if you dare! Leftover cold meat with pickle and vegetables 
makes yummy sandwiches. Try cold corned beef, mustard and coleslaw.</p> 
<p>Keep your fridge stocked with low fat cheese such as mozzarella or edam and 
soft cheese such as cottage cheese.</p> 
<p>Margarine or mayonnaise isn't necessary. Instead, to add extra moisture and 
help the filling stick together use low fat hummus, salsa or other low fat dips.
</p> 
<p>Spread cold mashed pumpkin or kumara on bread to create a delicious base 
for other ingredients.</p> 
<h2><strong>Four examples of an ideal lunch</strong></h2> 
<ul> 
<li>Bread roll with filling + a piece of fruit + a pottle of yoghurt</li> 
<li>Homemade lentil and vegetable soup + rye bread</li> 
<li>Quiche + homemade salad with low fat dressing</li> 
<li>Last night's leftovers with plenty of vegetables + some carbohydrate</li> 
</ul> 
<h2>7 tips for healthy lunches</h2> 
<ol> 
<li><strong></strong>Have salads all year round. During winter, use 
cauliflower, kumara, carrot or parsnip instead of lettuce or cabbage.</li> 
<li>Roast winter vegetables such as pumpkin, parsnip, carrots and yams in a 
small amount of good quality rice bran, olive or canola oil. Pack in a 
container and eat cold as a salad or reheat as a hot dish. Remember to pack a 
fork!</li> 
<li>Keep a box of Weet-Bix at work. While usually a breakfast food, this also 
makes a quick lunch.</li> 
<li>Canned food such as fish in spring water is a good standby. Simply open 
the can and add the fish to a bread roll.</li> 
<li>Nuts and seeds add extra crunch and flavour. As these are high in fat, 
limit to small quantities. Try a combination of:
<p> - walnuts, cottage cheese and tomato </p>
<p>- grated edam cheese, pumpkin seeds, lettuce and chutney</p>
<p> - dry roasted peanuts, lite cream cheese, chicken breast and sliced red 
capsicums.</p></li> 
<li>Try these tasty lunch ideas for variety: 
<p>- rice cakes with low fat toppings</p>
<p>- vegetable pieces and low fat dip</p>
<p>- fruit, unsweetened jelly and low fat, unsweetened yoghurt</p>
<p>- fresh fruit salad</p>
<p>- sushi.</p></li> 
<li>There is nothing worse than a soggy tomato sandwich or a squashed filled 
roll. Invest in a decent lunch box to keep your food safe. Consider an 
insulated lunch box. School lunch boxes are great for adults too. If you 
don&rsquo;t have a fridge or freezer pads to keep your lunch cool, save yoghurt 
or other cold items for days when you are home.</li> </ol>  &copy; <em>diabetes

<h1>Healthy cheese choices</h1> 
<p>Do you wonder how cheese fits into your eating plan? Are you confused about 
the different cheeses and which ones are better for your health?<strong>Alison 
Pask</strong>, a New Zealand registered dietitian, gives us a guide to making 
healthy cheese choices.</p> 
<p><b>It is recommended that we eat 2-3 servings of reduced or low fat milk or 
milk products each day.</b></p> 
<h2><strong>How many servings should we eat?</strong></h2> 
<p>Cheese is a valuable source of calcium and protein. However, cheese can 
also be a hidden source of salt and fat, especially saturated fat.</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Choose low fat cheeses for everyday use</li> 
<li>Save higher fat cheeses for occasional use or when your recipe really 
needs the extra flavour a stronger tasting cheese will provide</li> 
<li>Occasional use of a higher fat cheese would be a 2cm cube no more than 
once a week.</li> </ul> 
<h3><strong></strong></h3> 
<h2><strong>What is the fat content of different cheeses?</strong></h2> 
<p>The key nutritional concern when choosing cheese is the fat content. The 
fat content of cheese varies considerably.</p> 
<p>Low fat cottage cheese can have a fat content of less than 1%, whereas some 
higher fat cheeses can be over 40% fat.</p> 
<h2> Approximate fat content of cheeses </h2> 
<p>Always check the nutrition information panel as the fat content will vary 
depending on the brand.</p> Cheese Fat <br>
Reduced fat cottage cheese 0.5% <br>
Quark 13% <br>
Feta 16% <br>
Lite cream cheese 16% <br>
Mozzarella 18% <br>

Camembert or Brie 22% <br>
Edam 25% <br>
Parmesan 30% <br>
Cheddar or tasty 35% 
<br> Cream cheese 37% <br>
Double Cream Camembert 40% <br>
Blue cheese 41% <br>

<br> <br>
<br>

<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<h2><strong>Soft cheeses</strong></h2> 
<p>Generally softer cheeses are lower in fat, especially fresh cheeses like 
cottage, ricotta, quark (sometimes spelt quarg), feta and mozzarella. These 
cheeses are bland in flavour and are therefore useful to carry other flavours.
</p> 
<p>You can use ricotta and quark in both sweet and savoury dishes including 
quiches and cheesecakes. They also make great spreads on breads or bases for 
dips, especially when teamed with a vibrant flavour such as chilli or pesto.</p>
<p>Use them when you need moisture, such as to bind stuffing for a chicken or 
for a topping on a baked potato.</p> 
<p>The higher moisture content of fresh cheeses means they are better used in 
cold dishes. If you wish to add them to hot dishes such as casseroles, sauces 
or soups, remove the dish from the heat and add the cheese at the last minute 
to avoid curdling.</p> 
<h4><strong>Feta </strong></h4> 
<ul> 
<li>Preserved in brine with a crumbly texture </li> 
<li>Great in salads or accompanied with spinach wrapped in filo pastry.</li> 
<li>Tends to be high in salt - try rinsing off the brine before using.</li> 
</ul> 
<h4><strong>Mozzarella</strong></h4> 
<ul> 
<li>Has a stringy, stretchy texture</li> 
<li>A bland tasting cheese so is best used with flavoursome ingredients or in 
cooking such as a topping on pizza.</li> </ul> 
<h4><strong>Parmesan</strong></h4> 
<ul> 
<li>Strongly flavoured with a unique aroma</li> 
<li>The smell of fresh Parmesan is not as strong as powdered Parmesan</li> 
<li>You need only small quantities for maximum effect - if you use 10g of 
Parmesan cheese at 30% fat that gives you less fat in total than using 50g of 
Edam cheese at 25% fat.</li> </ul> 
<h2>10 tips for healthy cheese choices</h2> 
<ol> 
<li>When cooking, use a stronger flavoured cheese - to get a good flavour you 
need a smaller amount than for a bland cheese</li> 
<li>Grated cheese goes further than sliced cheese - use a micro-plane grater 
for best results as it grates very finely</li> 
<li>As cheese is high in salt, avoid adding extra salt to your recipe</li> 
<li>Crackers are usually high in fat - adding cheese increases the fat content 
even further</li> 
<li>Low fat cheeses are good alternatives to full fat varieties - try mixing 
two different varieties together e.g. Edam for flavour and Mozzarella for 
texture</li> 
<li>A cheese board and fresh fruit platter is a great option to take as a 
plate to an event</li> 
<li>Try serving a cheese board and fresh fruit platter instead of dessert - 
take the cheese out of the fridge for about an hour before serving as this 
allows the flavour to develop</li> 
<li>To avoid cheese going mouldy, buy smaller blocks or divide a larger block 
up and freeze</li> 
<li>Grated cheese freezes well and thaws quickly so you can use it straight 
from the freezer</li> 
<li>Eating a small amount of higher fat cheese occasionally may be a better 
choice than eating a larger amount of a lower fat, mild tasting cheese 
regularly.</li> </ol>  &copy; <em>diabetes</em>, The Magazine of Diabetes New

<h1>Catering for people with diabetes</h1> 
<p>Planning and serving appropriate healthy food to people with diabetes can 
be daunting at times. Meals with friends, club meetings, sports events and even 
afternoon tea at the bowling club can be a challenge. However, you&rsquo;ll be 
pleased to discover people with diabetes do not need any special foods.</p> 
<p>Serve salads and vegetables with all meals.</p> 
<p>A healthy eating pattern and portion control are the basis for any healthy 
eating plan, whether or not you have diabetes. The only exception is that 
people with diabetes need to ensure they don't drink sugary drinks.</p> 
<p>We all understand the benefits of eating for health, however sometimes we 
need to put theory into practice. People with diabetes are just like any other 
person and will attend functions, sports meetings, seminars, local society 
meetings and conferences. They are likely to be your friends or family that you 
have over for dinner or afternoon tea.</p> 
<p>Like people with heart disease or those trying to lose a few extra 
kilograms, people following healthy eating patterns depend on the person doing 
the catering to provide them with a variety of food to choose from which 
reinforces the healthy eating message they strive to achieve.</p> 
<p>People can be enticed with the presentation of food, so go to some extra 
effort to ensure your healthy options look attractive. It is best not to tempt 
people by offering food they shouldn&rsquo;t have. Be a good role model and 
think about serving only healthy food.</p> 
<h2><strong>Healthy choices</strong></h2> 
<p>If you are in charge of the catering, before each function use this 
checklist to ensure healthy choices are available:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Selection of wholegrain breads without spreads</li> 
<li>Spreads e.g. margarine or avocado </li> 
<li>Low fat milk e.g. trim</li> 
<li>Water to drink </li> 
<li>Vegetables and meats cooked using no added fat </li> 
<li>Lean meat or chicken without the skin </li> 
<li>Dressings and sauces served in separate dishes on the side </li> 
<li>Always have a bowl of fresh fruit</li> 
<li>Artificial sweeteners for tea and coffee</li> 
<li>Diet or unsweetened drinks, but beware - many drinks with no added sugar 
contain large amounts of natural sugar and this will have a similar effect on 
increasing blood glucose as a sweetened drink</li> 
<li>Desserts are not necessary.</li> </ul> 
<p>Often large selections of food are served at functions and people can be 
tempted to eat more than they usually would. So keep portions small. It is also 
a good idea to use bread and butter sized plates rather than dinner plates, so 
people can&rsquo;t put too much on their plate. Give people the choice of how 
much dressing, spread or sauce to add.</p> 
<p>Have a hypo basket available for emergencies. Include glucose tablets or 
jellybeans as well as a longer-acting carbohydrate item such as cheese and 
crackers or a muesli bar.</p> 
<h2><strong>Morning and afternoon teas</strong></h2> 
<p>Items to serve for morning or afternoon tea:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Club sandwiches made with wholegrain bread</li> 
<li>Asparagus rolls</li> 
<li>Fresh fruit platter</li> 
<li>Fruit buns or fruit loaf </li> 
<li>Muffins prepared with plenty of fruit or vegetables, oil or margarine, 
some wholemeal flour, bran and reduced fat milk. Watch the size of the muffins 
as many are large and half a muffin may be more appropriate. See recipe for
sweetcorn and chive muffins ... </li> 
<li>Crackers e.g. wholegrain or water crackers, topped with low fat cheese, 
light cream cheese, vegetables or avocado. Beware - many crackers are high in 
fat and may be no better than chips.</li> </ul> 
<h2><strong>Lunch and dinner</strong></h2> 
<p>Items to serve for lunch or dinner:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>A variety of breads especially grainy breads e.g. wholemeal, wholegrain, 
baguette, bagels, focaccia, pita, high fibre white</li> 
<li>Use margarine as a spread instead of butter</li> 
<li>Mini pizzas topped with lean meat, vegetables and mozzarella</li> 
<li>Sandwich fillings e.g. fresh or grilled vegetables, lean meat, skinless 
chicken, fish, egg, reduced-fat cheese such as cottage or ricotta, avocado, 
fresh fruit, dried fruit</li> 
<li>Spreads and condiments e.g. chutney, pickles, and pesto. Small amounts of 
ordinary tomato-based sauces and pickles are unlikely to raise blood glucose 
levels. If using large quantities of sweet and sour sauce or sweet chilli 
sauce, use an artificially sweetened variety.</li> 
<li>Vegetable-based soups containing legumes e.g. red kidney beans, lentils, 
split peas and chickpeas</li> 
<li>Serve salads and vegetables with all meals but remember to serve dressings 
separately. Prepare dressings from ingredients such as olive or canola oils, 
vinegar, lemon juice, herbs and spices. Better still, try an oil-free dressing. 
Lemon juice with yoghurt makes a tasty dressing. See recipes forsalads ... </li>
<li>Select healthy cooking methods e.g. oven bake, stir-fry, boil, grill, 
microwave, barbecue, steam or poach</li> 
<li>Use beans and lentils to bulk up meat dishes where possible. See recipe for
chickpea and spinach curry ...</li> 
<li>Avoid processed meats, as the majority are high in fat and salt e.g. 
sausages, salami, frankfurters and luncheon sausage.</li> </ul> 
<p>It isn&rsquo;t always necessary to serve nibbles and finger foods before a 
meal. In fact, many people can consume enough energy and carbohydrates from 
nibbles alone and then blame the meal for pushing up blood glucose levels.</p> 
<p>For someone with diabetes, the total amount of food eaten throughout the 
day has an impact on blood glucose levels. So don&rsquo;t be tempted to just 
blame the last food you ate.</p> 
<h2><strong>Food to serve with alcohol</strong></h2> 
<p>If you are drinking alcohol, remember never to drink on an empty stomach. A 
wise host will always serve food with alcohol. Some suggestions include:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Vegetable-based dips such as hummus. Check the fat content as some can be 
high in fat. Use reduced-fat cream cheese, reduced-fat yoghurt, pureed 
vegetables or pureed beans to prepare dips. Add flavour with herbs and spices 
such as garlic, chilli, fresh herbs such as basil or coriander. Serve with 
crackers e.g. wholegrain, water crackers or crispbreads, raw vegetables and 
breads. See recipe foryoghurt dip, salmon dip, or guacamole avocado dip ... 
</li> 
<li>Make your own homemade pita chips or bagel chips. Slice into triangles, 
brush with oil and bake in the oven until golden brown.</li> 
<li>Fresh seasonal fruit platters or fruit kebabs</li> 
<li>Vegetable sticks or vegetable kebabs with non-creamy dipping sauces e.g. 
tomato salsa.</li> 
<li>Plain nuts without added salt or savoury coating e.g. almonds, peanuts, 
walnuts and cashews. Serve nuts in the shell with a nutcracker available, as 
having to crack them open slows down the amount eaten.</li> 
<li>Cheese platters &ndash; use reduced-fat cheeses such as cottage, ricotta, 
and quark</li> 
<li>Serve small sandwiches or top small slices of bread with various spreads 
and toppings such as skinless chicken, seafood or lean meat slices</li> 
<li>Stuffed vegetables such as small baked potatoes with a reduced-fat topping
</li> 
<li>Cherry tomatoes, mushrooms, zucchini and peppers - these are fun served on 
a stick</li> 
<li>Sushi, pretzels and plain popcorn</li> 
<li>Mini fruit muffins, scones or pikelets with savoury fillings.</li> 
<li>Baked filo pastry triangles with vegetable fillings. See recipe for 
spinach and ricotta parcels ... </li> 
<li>Homemade bite-sized pizzas topped with vegetables, lean meat and 
mozzarella cheese.</li> </ul> 
<p>Planning is your best tool. Serve a selection of healthy food choices to 
make sure your function is a success.</p>

<h1>Casseroles - ready made meals</h1> 
<p><b>Preparing and cooking meals can become stressful at the end of a busy 
day. Even thinking about what to place on the table for hungry mouths can 
create unnecessary worry. It pays to be well prepared and plan meals ahead of 
time to ensure a balanced meal is available each night for you and your family.
</b></p> 
<p>It&rsquo;s a relief to unlock the front<br>
door and smell a delicious 
evening<br>
meal already cooking that can be<br>
served piping hot.</p> 
<p>It&rsquo;s a relief to unlock the front door and smell a delicious evening 
meal already cooking that can be served piping hot without any fuss. A 
casserole containing vegetables as well as meat can save a lot of time and you 
can eat it knowing you are receiving all the goodness recommended.</p> 
<p>Preparing an extra large casserole saves time and effort, especially if 
half is left over for the following night. Crock-pots, slow cookers, or even 
setting your oven on automatic timer, can be lifesavers for busy people. Almost 
anything can be successfully cooked in a crock-pot, from a roast chicken to 
corned beef. You can create one-pot meals from the most basic items in your 
refrigerator or cupboard.</p> 
<p>One of the advantages of casseroles is that they are generally better made 
with the cheaper cuts of meat, such as chuck or topside steak, or lamb neck 
chops and lamb shanks. Any chicken pieces are suitable for casseroles, but 
remove the skin and fat first. Lean pork with little or no visible fat also 
makes tender, tasty casseroles.</p> 
<p>Fish is one of the few types of meat not ideally suited to casseroles. The 
soft flesh breaks up quickly and is best left for fast cooking methods such as 
grilling or baking.</p> 
<p>Around 100&ndash;150 grams of meat is enough for one person, so use this 
amount as a guide to calculate the amount to buy for your household.</p> 
<p>The key is to trim away any excess fat, skin and gristle before cooking. 
Cut the meat into even-sized pieces and coat in flour. Browning the meat in a 
frypan before cooking isn&rsquo;t necessary; you can get equally successful 
results when the meat is cooked without browning first.</p> 
<p>A good flavour comes from having a good sauce. There is no need to add 
extra salt before cooking, as often the casserole will become more salty as the 
liquid evaporates and the sauce thickens. If it still needs seasoning with salt 
then add this at the table, but do taste first to decide if extra salt is 
needed.</p> 
<p>Often meat stocks are high in salt. A tomato-based sauce is a good addition 
to casseroles but beware of adding prepared cream-based sauces as they are 
higher in fat than vegetable-based sauces.</p> 
<p>Fast cooking vegetables such as peas, broccoli, or mushrooms are best added 
towards the end of cooking to prevent them becoming mushy. However, most other 
vegetables can be added at the beginning, for example carrots, parsnips and 
onions.</p> 
<p>Fruit added to casseroles makes a welcome surprise. Try chicken and 
pineapple, chicken and apricots, or beef and tamarillo. The choice is limited 
only by your imagination.</p> 
<p>The latest recommendation for people with diabetes is to increase fruit and 
vegetable intake to at least 3-4 serves of each per day. Adding fruit to meat 
dishes is a great way to work toward meeting this guideline. Remember that 
tinned, dried or frozen fruit can be counted towards this recommended daily 
quantity.</p> 
<p>Adding legumes or lentils to casseroles is a great way to make the meal go 
further, reducing the cost and adding extra fibre. There are many wonderful 
nutritional benefits from adding lentils and beans to meals for people with 
diabetes.</p> 
<p>The latest dietary guidelines recommend 4-5 serves of legumes each week. 
You can purchase these prepared in a can and put them straight in your 
casserole at the beginning of cooking.</p> 
<p>Starting off with lean meat is essential, but you can also reduce fat by 
skimming off any fat floating on the surface of your casserole. This is made 
easier if you cool the casserole overnight, as the fat will set on the top and 
can then be lifted off easily with a spoon before reheating.</p> 
<p>It is important to remember that meat should only be reheated once, 
otherwise it becomes a risk for food poisoning. Always ensure you reheat meat 
until it is piping hot.</p> 
<p>If time is an issue, a casserole can be served with a slice of bread. If 
time permits, either rice or pasta makes a good bed to mop up the gravy and 
casserole juices. Just watch the amount of extra carbohydrate you serve with a 
one-pot meal.</p> 
<p>Extra vegetables served with your casserole are recommended to add 
additional nutrients, colour, flavour and fibre.</p>

</p> 
<h1>A guide to beans, lentils, legumes and pulses</h1> 
<p>A legume, sometimes known as a pulse, is the edible seed of pod-bearing 
plants such as beans, peas and lentils. Most of us are familiar with beans like 
broad beans, runner beans, bean sprouts, and of course baked beans.</p> 
<p>However, some other legumes are less well known. New Zealand registered 
dietitian Alison Pask tells us about health benefits of legumes that we can't 
afford to ignore.</p> 
<p>Legumes have great nutritional value: they are full of fibre, low in fat, 
and a good source of protein.</p> 
<p>They are a staple food in many countries - lentils in India, chickpeas in 
the Middle East and pinto beans in Mexico. And legumes are the main source of 
protein for people who don't eat meat.</p> 
<p>Research indicates legumes may help to reduce cholesterol levels, prevent 
heart disease, control blood glucose levels in people with diabetes and prevent 
some cancers.</p> 
<p>These benefits are likely to be due to the high soluble fibre content found 
naturally in legumes.</p> 
<h2>Counting carbohydrate</h2> 
<p>Legumes are rich in carbohydrates. If you are counting your carbohydrate 
intake, you therefore must include legumes when you have them as part of a meal.
</p> 
<p>One 15g portion is equal to:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>A quarter of a cup of baked beans, or</li> 
<li>One cup of broad beans, or</li> 
<li>Half a cup of cooked canned chickpeas.</li> </ul> 
<p>The great news is that legumes have a low glycaemic index (GI) and are 
absorbed slowly over a long period of time. Therefore they will not produce 
high blood glucose levels unless you eat too many.</p> 
<p>The New Zealand Food Guidelines recommend eating 4-5 serves of legumes a 
week to improve our health. A serve, for example, is considered to be 1 cup of 
cooked beans, peas, lentils or tofu.</p> 
<h2><strong>Cooking legumes</strong></h2> 
<p>Legumes are available dried or pre-cooked in cans. Dried beans do take 
longer to cook, so soaking beans first is an important step as it helps to 
soften the outer skins so they can cook more efficiently.</p> 
<p>It's a good idea to soak beans in plenty of water overnight; they will 
absorb twice their own weight of water. You can cook lentils and split peas 
without soaking.</p> 
<p>Follow your recipe or the instructions on the package, as the cooking time 
will be different for each type of legume. They are cooked when you can squash 
them easily between your fingers. If you add salt, do this at the end of the 
cooking, otherwise it will make the skins tough.</p> 
<p>Red kidney beans can be poisonous if not cooked properly, so if you are 
using these make sure you discard the water you have soaked them in and boil 
them for the recommended time in fresh water.</p> 
<p>Once cooked, legumes will last in the fridge for up to one week. Beans 
freeze well and will keep in the freezer for up to six months.</p> 
<p>Beans are an inexpensive food and therefore are a great way to make a meal 
go further.</p> 
<h2><strong>Ideas for using legumes </strong></h2> 
<ul> 
<li>Add legumes to mince or a casserole for extra flavour</li> 
<li>Lentils and beans can be bland but they are great at absorbing spicy 
flavours like chilli and curry</li> 
<li>Canned beans also come in flavoured sauces such as BBQ and Chilli, so will 
add delicious flavours to your meals</li> 
<li>You can hide mashed beans in meals and only you will know they are there - 
fussy children or those who refuse to eat beans will have no idea they are 
eating them.</li> </ul> 
<h2><strong>Flatulence can be a problem</strong></h2> 
<h3> </h3> 
<p>Beans are not digested in the small intestine. They pass on to the large 
intestine where they are fermented by bacteria and form carbon dioxide, 
hydrogen and sometimes methane. This means some people may get flatulence after 
eating beans.</p> 
<p>If this is a problem, soak the beans well before cooking, throw away the 
soaking water and cook them thoroughly. A gradual increase of beans on the menu 
will help your body get accustomed to the extra gas production over time.</p> 
<h2>Use beans in a wide range of recipes</h2> 
<ul> 
<li>Hummus - this is a creamy dip made from chickpeas. It's great on toast or 
sandwiches in place of other high fat spreads. To ensure it's low in fat, mix 
mashed beans with cottage cheese and spices.</li> 
<li>Bean salad, for example three-bean salad or lentil salad.</li> 
<li>Lentil patties for burgers.</li> 
<li>During cold weather, think about adding lentils or split peas to 
casseroles or soups. Minestrone or ham and pea soups, if using low fat 
ingredients, can be filling meals by themselves.</li> 
<li>Nachos are a great way to introduce beans, but be aware that the topping 
you choose, for example, cheese, sour cream or avocado, could pile on fat and 
energy.</li> </ul> 
<h2><strong>Give legumes a go</strong></h2> 
<ul> 
<li>Find some delicious recipes that add extra interest and variety to your 
meals</li> 
<li>Go for a walk to the library and get out a recipe book using beans and 
other legumes</li> 
<li>Or download recipes from websites &ndash; see a great chickpea and spinach 
curry...</li> </ul>

</p> 
<h1>Summer barbecues</h1> 
<p>The secret to a successful and stress-free Kiwi barbecue is all in the 
preparation. Most things can be prepared the day before, allowing you time to 
relax instead of slaving behind a hot stove.</p> 
<p>By getting your preparation out of the way the previous day, your barbecue 
will be much more fun.</p> 
<p>The night before, you can boil your potatoes, cook your rice or pasta for 
your salads, cook the beans for the bean salad and make the marinades.</p> 
<p>If you don't have time for this, you can always get out the can opener and 
open a can of beans or use a supermarket marinade.</p> 
<h2><strong>Many Kiwi barbecues have too much meat</strong></h2> 
<p>When deciding on the menu you only need one meat, but if you have guests 
you may wish to have one red meat and one white meat such as chicken.</p> 
<p>Of course, the kids will want sausages. Pre-cooking these will help to get 
rid of some of the extra fat that sausages usually contain.</p> 
<p>Remember the meat should be the size of the palm of your hand. If possible 
avoid charred (black or burnt) meat as it may be associated with an increased 
cancer risk.</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Fish wrapped in foil cooks quickly and there is no cleaning up to do 
afterwards</li> 
<li>Marinate chicken overnight in lemon juice, olive oil, pepper and fresh 
herbs from the garden &ndash; delicious</li> 
<li>Try a marinade of yoghurt and herbs</li> 
<li>Paint steak in your favourite marinade or barbecue sauce before grilling - 
the marinade makes your meat not only tastier but also more tender.</li> </ul> 
<p>Marinades containing sugar may burn quickly; you&rsquo;ll be surprised how 
delicious your favourite marinade recipe can be without the sugar. If you want 
a sweet taste, an artificial sweetener is a good alternative to sugar.</p> 
<p>A favourite marinade is squeezing a fresh orange and a clove of garlic over 
steak and leaving to sit overnight in the fridge.</p> 
<ul> 
<li>The key to good tender steak is letting it rest after cooking</li> 
<li>Homemade hamburgers are quick and easy</li> 
<li>Try ham steaks and salad inside bread buns</li> 
<li>Serve fresh fish fillets on pieces of French bread with lettuce.</li> </ul>
<p>Barbecues are no exception for healthy eating. Use the Diabetes New Zealand 
Ideal Plate as a guide to the correct portions of food &ndash; at least half a 
plate of free vegetables, a quarter plate of a plate of carbohydrate, and a 
quarter of a plate of meat or meat alternative.</p> 
<h2><strong>Plan on serving plenty of vegetables</strong></h2> 
<p>Zucchini, red and green peppers, tomatoes and eggplant are all great on the 
barbecue. Aim for a variety of different coloured vegetables.</p> 
<ul> 
<li>The easiest way is to cut everything into bite size chunks</li> 
<li>Throw them onto the barbecue plate with a little olive oil to prevent them 
from sticking</li> 
<li>Try threading vegetables onto a skewer as this makes them easier to handle 
and they look great when ready to serve - you won't lose any vegetables over 
the sides of the barbecue when you are turning them</li> 
<li>A non-stick barbecue mat is a good idea, this way you don't need to add 
any oil</li> 
<li>Fresh corn on the cob is a real winner - just boil the cob first and 
finish on the barbecue - it tastes great without butter</li> 
<li>Whole mushrooms maintain their shape, but don't overcook them.</li> </ul> 
<h2><strong>Just a word of caution</strong></h2> 
<p>You are best not to serve a big selection of salads containing carbohydrate 
or other vegetables as human nature shows we like to try a bit of everything. 
The rice, pasta, potato, kumara and bread will all add up and contribute to 
your overall carbohydrate intake.</p> 
<p>People often say they can't understand why blood glucose levels go higher 
than usual when they didn't eat a large serve of any one item. But it is easy 
to forget that all serves of carbohydrate foods count and too much total 
carbohydrate may increase blood glucose levels above desirable for someone with 
diabetes.</p> 
<h2>The Four Cs</h2> 
<p>Barbecues are an ideal breeding house for bacteria to multiply. There is no 
point in serving healthy tasty food if it gives everyone food poisoning.</p> 
<p>Remember the four simple guidelines for serving safe food:</p> 
<h3><strong>Clean</strong></h3> 
<ul> 
<li>Wash your hands before cooking</li> 
<li>Don't mix utensils used for raw and cooked meat.</li> </ul> 
<h3><strong>Chill</strong></h3> 
<ul> 
<li>Keep food in the fridge until ready to cook or serve.</li> </ul> 
<h3>Cook</h3> 
<ul> 
<li>Cook food well, especially chicken, until the flesh is cooked all the way 
through - cook it until all the pink flesh turns white</li> 
<li>It is a good idea to pre-cook chicken in the oven before finishing it off 
onto the barbecue.</li> </ul> 
<h3>Cover</h3> 
<ul> 
<li>Cover leftovers and store in the fridge and eat the following day</li> 
<li>Discard food if it has been sitting out for two hours or more.</li> </ul>
