<p>TREE CALENDAR<br>
Fall<br>
Keep your trees well watered. They will not dry 
out as much as in summer so don't over water. You can fertilize through mid to 
late October.<br>
<br>
During the growing season, your trees need proper 
watering, feeding, and disease and pest control.&nbsp; </p> 
<p>FERTILIZING There are many schools of thought on fertilizing bonsai. The 
tree is in a confined space with little nutrients so fertilizing is a 
must.&nbsp;<br>
 The trees are not fed during winter dormancy. &nbsp;A liquid 
mix is easy to use, although many people use a solid product like Osmocote, if 
you don't mind<br>
 seeing the little pellets on the surface. The tree is 
fertilized every time it is watered. It can be used on trees that are still 
training in pots on the ground.<br>
 A balanced 10-10-10 fertilizer is a good 
choice for most of the growing season. The first number represents the amount 
of nitrogen, which benefits the leaves.&nbsp;<br>
 The second number is the 
amount of phosphorus, benefiting the roots. Potassium is the last number, 
helping the flowers and fruit.&nbsp;A higher nitrogen fertilizer,<br>
 
&nbsp;25-15-15 will help the leaves in spring, while a higher phosphorus 
fertilizer is beneficial in autumn for strong root development for the coming 
year. Many people&nbsp; <br>
use </p> 
<p>The tree should be well watered before applying liquid fertilizer, or you 
run the risk of burning the roots. The amount and frequency of application is 
widely discussed,<br>
 as some people use half of the label's recommended 
strength every two weeks while other use up to 3 times the rate every 10-14 
days. The amount of fertilizer may depend <br>
 on what you are doing with the 
tree. Too much fertilizer may cause excessive growth which may not be the 
desired effect on refined trees. If the tree is in training and you<br>
 want 
to thicken up the trunk and branches, you may feed with a higher dose.</p> 
<p>DISEASE AND PEST CONTROL&nbsp;<b> </b>An effective spray for both disease 
and pests would be a spray designed fore rose care. It is mild enough to take 
care of<br>
 most problems you might find on bonsai. If possible, apply any 
controls on cloudy days or when the trees are shaded. I have killed several 
trees applying a strong<br>
 pest control in full sun. A strong spray of water 
will knock off aphids and any other insects that you can see. </p> 
<p>  The following is excerpted from Bob Grealish's beginners bonsai book, 
found on this website<br>
 found under the News and Resources link. </p> 
<p><b>WATERING</b></p> 
<p>All trees should be checked at least daily. They will need more frequent 
watering if:</p> 
<ol> 
<li>The soil drains very well and therefore holds less water; </li> 
<li>The pot is small; </li> 
<li>The tree is rootbound; </li> 
<li>The plant uses a lot of water because of large leaves or stomata that 
transpire heavily, or because it is in the sun or wind.</li> </ol> 
<p>The soil should be watered when the top layer is getting dry just under the 
surface. Until you are familiar with your plants, you may have to scratch 
through the top layer with your finger to see if the soil is moist underneath. 
Often, even if the surface appears dry, the pot will have plenty of water, 
especially if it is large or the soil is heavy. First wet the surface so it 
will take water; then go back and water thoroughly. Water until it starts 
coming out through the drainage holes. As long as the soil drains well, it is 
hard to over water. Excess watering will wash out the fertilizer faster, 
however. For most trees, you should spray the foliage on top and underneath in 
addition to watering the soil. This will unclog the stomata and discourage some 
pests. One easy way to water with a hose is to attach a bonsai nozzle (e.g. 
Masakuni, from bonsai vendors) to a brass shut-off valve or a plastic sprayer 
pistol to turn the water on and off. Water in the morning or early evening if 
you can. Do not water leaves in the hot sun because they might burn; and do not 
water leaves late at night because they may not dry out and this will encourage 
rot. Drip irrigation may be used, but hand watering encourages you to inspect 
each tree every day.</p> 
<p><b>SUNLIGHT</b></p> 
<p>It is best to place the bonsai so they get at least morning sun. Most 
evergreens, especially pines, need as many hours of direct sun as possible (in 
our climate.) Most other plants do well with morning sun through mid-afternoon. 
Some trees prefer light shade most of the day. These are thin leaf plants such 
as maples and plants that usually grow on the forest floor such as azaleas. 
Trees that get a lot of sun will actually produce more compact growth with 
shorter internodes and smaller foliage. If the plant is not getting enough sun, 
it will reach for it with longer internodes and gangly growth. It will also 
produce larger leaves to increase its sun exposure. Therefore, a balance should 
be reached so the plant gets enough sun for good bonsai proportions without 
burning the leaves. Rotate the plants frequently (1/4 turn once a week) so each 
side gets the same amount of sun. Also make sure the trees are not so close 
together that they shade each other.</p>

<p><b>FERTILIZING</b><br>
<br>
 Like soil mixture, fertilizer application is 
controversial. Bonsai usually do well with fertilizing regularly from spring to 
fall. They need the three basic components of fertilizer: nitrogen, phosphorous 
and potassium. In addition, they need minor nutrients and trace elements such 
as calcium, iron, magnesium, etc. There are two basic kinds of fertilizer, 
chemical and organic. Chemical fertilizers have the three basic elements in 
percentages indicated by three numbers, such as &quot;5-10-10.&quot; They also 
contain trace elements in varying amounts. Chemical fertilizers are available 
to the roots immediately when you water with a solution of the dissolved 
fertilizer. Some common chemical fertilizers are Peters 20-20-20, Miracid, 
Miracle Grow and Rapid-Gro. Many people alternate these fertilizers to ensure 
the plant gets all the trace elements, which may differ from one fertilizer to 
another. Miracid has the additional advantage of acidifying the soil, which 
benefits most plants, especially azaleas (but not junipers.) Mix chemical 
fertilizers half strength, that is, one-half tablespoon per gallon of water. 
Add 1 to 2 drops of Superthrive, which is a root vitamin, per gallon. Water the 
soil with this mixture or soak the pots in it about once every two weeks during 
the growing season. In the early fall, since you don't need leaf growth, you 
may switch to half-strength fertilizer with a lower proportion of nitrogen. As 
mentioned above, fertilizing is controversial; and there are many other 
schedules which may be used.</p> 
<p>As an alternative to chemical fertilizers, you can use organic fertilizers, 
such as rapeseed cake, Green King fertilizer, or various mixtures of bone meal, 
blood meal, cottonseed meal, fish emulsion, etc. Usually cakes of these 
fertilizers are placed on the soil surface and watered through so the soil gets 
a small dose with each watering. These fertilizers must be broken down by soil 
bacteria to be used by the tree, so they work somewhat more slowly. Do not 
fertilize in the winter, just before repotting or for a month after repotting, 
or if the tree is sick. Trees almost never get sick from lack of fertilizer. If 
a tree wilts, turns yellow, drops leaves, etc., look for another cause rather 
than reaching for the fertilizer. You will only make a sick tree worse by 
fertilizing.</p>

<p>DISEASE CONTROL </p> 
<p>The most common diseases to attack bonsai are insects and mold. Insects 
come in many varieties, most commonly, aphids, fly larvae, caterpillars, mites 
and scale insects. Aphids can often be washed off with a stream of water; and 
caterpillars are merely removed by hand. Mites are discouraged by washing the 
foliage when watering the tree. Scale insects may be scraped from the leaves. 
Insecticides will work for most pests but may be toxic to some trees. Some 
common insecticide sprays are Isotox, Sevin, Cygon, Malathion, etc. Mix 
insecticides as directed (normal dilution) and spray the foliage with a spray 
bottle. Wear plastic gloves and a respirator when working with these toxic 
chemicals, spray outside, and do not inhale or ingest the spray. Mix only what 
you need so you don't have to dump excess chemicals in the drain.</p> 
<p>An alternative to try is Safer spray, a soap solution that kills insects 
but is relatively non-toxic to humans. Mix it as directed, add a teaspoon of 
rubbing alcohol per gallon, and use it within 20 minutes of mixing for best 
effectiveness. Even better is Sunspray Horticultural Oil. This is a very 
refined petroleum oil (not dormant oil spray) that kills almost any pest that 
is present on the tree when you spray. It is relatively non-toxic, but should 
not be inhaled. Don't use it on junipers or other trees with a bluish color, 
because the foliage will turn very green. Pyrethrins (meant for spraying on 
vegetables) are very safe and work well on aphids, some scale and other 
insects. In general, avoid the toxic chemicals if you can because they may 
contribute to causing cancer or other diseases. Keep all chemicals in a locked 
cabinet away from children.</p> 
<p>Mold can attack the foliage or roots of a tree. It is discouraged by 
letting the foliage dry after watering (by not watering too late at night) and 
not over watering the tree. Good drainage helps prevent root-rot. Mold can be 
treated with chemical solutions of Funginex, Benomyl, Captan. These chemicals 
are potentially carcinogenic (cancer causing) so wear protection and don't 
allow them to contact your skin, mouth or lungs. Some bonsaists follow a 
preventative schedule of spraying most of their trees with a solution of a 
systemic insecticide and fungicide, perhaps three times per year, in spring, 
mid-summer and before winter storage. This is supplemented by close inspection 
of the trees when watering and by maintaining the tree's general health with 
proper soil, sunlight, fertilizer, watering and air circulation. More detailed 
discussions of pest control can be found in the bonsai texts. If you have a 
sick tree and do not know what's wrong, it's best to take it to an expert 
bonsaist or nurseryman for advice rather than spraying chemicals 
indiscriminately.</p>
