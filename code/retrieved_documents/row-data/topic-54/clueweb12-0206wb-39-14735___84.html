<p><b>Worst drought </b><b>ever tightens </b><b>grip on area</b></p> 
<p><b>By John M. Motter</b></p> 
<p><b>Staff Writer</b></p> 
<p>Drought conditions, the worst ever recorded here, continue to clamp a 
two-prong grip on Pagosa Country. </p> 
<p>The prongs include no significant rainfall for weeks on end and the menace 
of wildfire in the explosively dry forests covering Archuleta County.</p> 
<p>Open fires and all fireworks are banned throughout the county. 
Nevertheless, Sheriff Tom Richards is greatly concerned.</p> 
<p>&quot;Neighboring states still sell fireworks,&quot; Richards said. 
&quot;Some folks may purchase fireworks in their home state then come here. 
Maybe they haven't noticed they aren't allowed here. I just want it known, 
we're going to enforce the law against fireworks to the fullest extent 
possible. They won't be tolerated. We will pick up violators and prosecute 
them.&quot;</p> 
<p>Local fire officials eye the coming Fourth of July celebration with mixed 
emotions. Since this is the biggest event of the year hereabouts, officials 
hope the thousands of visitors will have their usual great time.</p> 
<p>At the same time, because fire conditions are so extremely volatile, 
officials are holding their breath, hoping almost against hope that a major 
fire won't erupt due to lightning or human carelessness.</p> 
<p>Officially, drought conditions here are rated &quot;Exceptional,&quot; the 
worst condition possible. Locally and across the state, officials have reacted 
by banning fires and fireworks just about everywhere.</p> 
<p>The governor has banned fires and fireworks across the length and breadth 
of the state. The Forest Service has closed one area of forest land inside the 
county, banned fires and fireworks, and restricted usage throughout the vast 
expanse of national forest. County officials have banned all fires and 
fireworks in Archuleta County. Cigarette smoking is allowed only within 
buildings or closed vehicles. Throwing a cigarette from a vehicle is a criminal 
act.</p> 
<p>A pre-fire alert issued by the county sheriff is in effect for everyone in 
the county. The fire alert is a warning to pack valuables and necessary items 
in order to be prepared if an evacuation be ordered.</p> 
<p>An actual evacuation, should one become necessary, will be preceded by a 
door-knocking notice from sheriff or fire officials, and accompanied by three 
blasts from the siren of an officially marked vehicle. If an evacuation is 
ordered, evacuees are expected to leave the premises immediately. Wildfire, 
under current conditions, travels surprisingly fast and can close escape routes 
in minutes.</p> 
<p>The Forest Service warns that sparks that cause fires may be generated by 
hot catalytic converters under vehicles, all-terrain vehicles and motorcycle 
engines, or caused by tow chains dragging behind vehicles, and lawn mower 
blades hitting rocks.</p> 
<p>A portion of the forest north of U.S. 160 and west of Pagosa Springs is 
closed to all unauthorized entrance. The eastern side of that closure starts 
with the Turkey Springs-U.S. 160 intersection and runs northerly just east of 
Turkey Springs Road to its intersection with Piedra Road. From that 
intersection, the line runs northerly, west of Piedra Road and the private land 
immediately west of Piedra Road to a point near the Pine River in the Weminuche 
Wilderness Area. The western boundary of the closure is the Animas River 
running through Durango.</p> 
<p>Forest Service roads closed within the area include Missionary Ridge Road 
(682), Turkey Springs Road (29), Beaver Meadows Road (135), First Notch Road 
(620), First Fork Road (22) and Mosca Road (631).</p> 
<p>Closed National Forest campgrounds include Florida/Transfer Park, Graham 
Creek, Middle Mountain, Miller Creek, North Canyon, Old Timers, Pine Point, 
Pine River, Vallecito, Lower Piedra, and Ute.</p> 
<p>Campgrounds open in the Pagosa Ranger District include West Fork, Wolf 
Creek, East Fork, Bridge, Williams, and Teal. The Blanco River and Ute 
campgrounds are closed. </p>

<p>Open fires and fireworks are banned on all San Juan National Forest and 
Bureau of Land Management lands. </p> 
<p>Overnight camping in areas outside designated wilderness areas is allowed 
only in developed campgrounds staffed by an on-duty host. Back-country 
dispersed camping is allowed only in the Weminuche, Lizard Head and South San 
Juan wilderness areas.</p> 
<p>All motorized vehicles must stay on roads designated as open on National 
Forest and Bureau visitor maps and not closed by barriers or gates. No 
motorized vehicles including all-terrain vehicles, motorcycles, and 4-wheel 
drives are allowed on trails or off of open roads.</p> 
<p>Local roads closed to entry include Game Farm (627), Lower Piedra 
Campground (621, First Fork (622), Devil Mountain (626), Turkey Springs (629), 
Piedra also known as Mosca (631), Trail Ridge (639) and Lake Bed (987).</p>

(566), Turkey Creek (580), Coal Creek also known as Fawn Gulch (581), both ends 
of Navajo Peaks (577), Fourmile Stock Drive (569), Weminuche also known as 
Poison Park (592), and Turkey Springs Hut and Trail System.</p> 
<p>Daytime parking is allowed on National Forest and Bureau lands only in 
designated parking areas or immediately adjacent to open roads in areas free of 
hazardous fuels. Overnight parking is allowed only in developed campgrounds 
staffed by an on-duty host and at wilderness trailhead parking areas. </p>

cutting with hand saws is allowed.</p> 
<p>Smoking is prohibited except inside an enclosed vehicle or building. 
Smoking outdoors, even in a cleared area, is prohibited.</p> 
<p>Building, maintaining, attending, or using a fire, campfire, charcoal 
broiler, or coal or wood burning stove is prohibited everywhere, including 
inside fire grates in developed recreation areas. Petroleum-fueled stoves and 
lanterns are allowed, but should be used with extreme caution.</p> 
<p>Use of explosives, welding, acetylene, or any other torch with an open 
flame is prohibited.</p> 
<p>National Forests adjacent to the San Juan National Forest are also either 
closed or severely restricted. These include the Rio Grand National Forest 
located across the Continental Divide east and north of the San Juan National 
Forest, and the Carson National Forest located across the state line in New 
Mexico. </p>

<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p> <b>Pagosa's </b> <b>firefighters </b> <b>back from </b> 
<b>Missionary</b> 
<p></p> 
<p>By Tess Noel Baker</p> 
<p>Staff Writer</p> 
<p>For the Pagosa Fire Protection District, it was a fairly quiet week, with a 
welcome homecoming.</p> 
<p>Over the weekend, district firefighters responded to a small fire at the 
transfer station on Trujillo Road south of downtown Pagosa Springs that started 
in a Dumpster and spread to a nearby field, and two false alarms, including a 
gas leak at a residence and a smoke sighting.</p> 
<p>Fire Chief Warren Grams said a resident called in a plume of smoke north of 
Piedra Estates about 6:30 p.m. June 30. Four people, two trucks and a 
helicopter searched the area thoroughly and found no fire. Piedra Estates is 
within town boundaries, east of Piedra Road.</p> 
<p>A crew of seven firefighters and two trucks returned to Pagosa Springs 
Monday morning after spending more than two weeks assisting with the Missionary 
Ridge fire near Durango. They first responded to a mutual aid call June 13. 
Since then, they have been working 12-hour days in several subdivisions 
protecting structures threatened by the 72,565-acre fire.</p> 
<p>As of 5 p.m. July 1, the Missionary Ridge fire was 50 percent contained and 
continued to threaten only 70 residents compared with 1,271 last week. It has, 
however, crossed over into the northwest corner of Archuleta County and is 
predicted to move in a northeasterly direction into Hinsdale County without 
threatening any structures.</p> 
<p>Because the Missionary Ridge Fire has moved from La Plata County into the 
northwest tip of Archuleta County, the Archuleta County sheriff signed an 
agreement giving command control of fighting that fire to the Colorado State 
Forest Service. </p> 
<p>The action assures uninterrupted continuance of the battle against the 
blaze using the same methods and the same crews battling the fire in La Plata 
County.</p> 
<p>At the same time, the action identifies the fire as a Federal Emergency 
Management Authority activity, assuring Archuleta County of considerable 
financial help in paying for fighting the fire.</p> 
<p>Lightning is being blamed for a wildfire that started June 29 in the 
Weminuche Wilderness Area about 16 air miles northeast of Pagosa Springs.</p> 
<p>According to a Pagosa Ranger District news release, smoke jumpers and one 
helicopter were dispatched to attack the 1-acre fire burning in Englemann 
spruce on steep slopes at 10,600 feet. The fire was 100-percent contained 
Monday and did not threaten any structures.</p> 
<p>Regarding a June 15 fire west of the Piedra River adjacent to U.S. 160, an 
article in last week's SUN reported that John Reich, a member of the Pagosa 
Fire Protection District, was one of the three people on the scene who started 
digging a fire line before the helicopter arrived. The other two were unnamed 
at the time.</p> 
<p>They have since been identified as Chris and Johnny Alvarez. Forest Service 
personnel said these three, all of whom had at least some fire training, were a 
significant help in bringing that fire under control quickly.</p>

<p><b>Widmer sentence: 90-days, </b><b>8-year probation, restitution</b></p> 
<p>By Tess Noel Baker</p> 
<p>Staff Writer</p> 
<p>A 6th District Court judge sentenced John Widmer to 90 days of jail and 
eight years of probation June 27 for stealing $161,000 from a Pagosa Springs 
Rotary Club scholarship fund.</p> 
<p>Widmer, of Pagosa Springs, pleaded guilty to one count of theft in excess 
of $15,000 under a plea agreement signed with the district attorney's office in 
May. The agreement set no restrictions on sentencing and required restitution 
of the full amount stolen.</p> 
<p>Widmer was originally charged with nine counts of theft, five for stealing 
more than $15,000 and four for stealing between $500 and $15,000 all relating 
to thefts from the scholarship fund in 2001. The fund was invested with Widmer, 
a licensed stockbroker with Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, and Rotary Club 
president.</p> 
<p>The Rotary Club was reimbursed for the full amount by Morgan Stanley, and 
that company then turned the case over to authorities. A Pagosa Springs police 
investigation into the matter led to Widmer's arrest.</p> 
<p>A member of the Rotary Club, a representative of Morgan Stanley, Widmer's 
wife and a business associate all spoke prior to sentencing. Widmer himself 
cried as he read a prepared statement apologizing to his family, Morgan Stanley 
and the community for the &quot;vicious cycle of lies and deceit.&quot; </p> 
<p>As conditions of parole, Judge David Dickinson restricted Widmer from any 
employment that would put him in contact with money or any credit instruments. 
Widmer must also undergo mental health and substance abuse evaluations, follow 
any recommendations from those and make full restitution in the amount of 
$164,459.18 to Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. He has been incarcerated since his 
arrest in early March. He will receive no credit for time served.</p> 
<p> </p> <b>Offering a big country helping </b> <b>of American birthday 
festivities</b> 
<p></p> 
<p>By Richard Walter</p> 
<p>Staff Writer</p> 
<p>Howdy y'all!</p> 
<p>Welcome to a touch of Americana you can't duplicate anywhere.</p> 
<p>This is Pagosa Country, can-do country if you will.</p> 
<p>We've had fire threats, we have a drought keeping our lawns dry and 
limiting gardens. We have a fire ban and a fireworks ban. What you are seeing 
in the countryside isn't the real Pagosa Country.</p> 
<p>The people you'll meet here are the real story. They've taken all the bad 
news in stride and put together a holiday celebration schedule that promises to 
provide entertainment for people of all ages.</p> 
<p>If you're looking for bombs bursting in air and rockets' red glare you 
won't find it. There's a countywide ban on fireworks of any kind. (If you 
brought your own, don't light them. We don't want our friends arrested).</p> 
<p>But, if you're looking for old-time country fun, you came to the right 
place.</p> 
<p>We opened our celebration with the carnival in Town Park and it will be 
here through July 7.</p> 
<p>The annual parade, believed to be the largest in the Southwest, kicks off 
at 10 a.m. Thursday at 8th and Pagosa streets next to the downtown City Market.
</p> 
<p>With at least, if not more than, 100 entries in the Rotary-sponsored event, 
you have about two hours of viewing time to set aside. Horses, old-timers, 
funny cars, scout troops, floats, Native American units, military units, and a 
lot of just plain fun are wrapped up in the parade. Come downtown early because 
thousands always line the way from 8th to 2nd streets, often three and four 
deep.</p> 
<p>Want to know who's in the parade? A review stand will be set up at Pagosa 
and San Juan streets and all participants will be introduced as they pass in 
review.</p> 
<p>Looking for that special something to show your aunt to explain why you 
spent the Independence Day holiday so far away from home? Try the dozens of 
booths in the Park to Park Arts and Crafts Show lining the Riverwalk from Town 
to Centennial parks starting at 9 a.m. daily through July 7.</p> 
<p>There'll be an old fashioned family celebration and concert starting at 
4:30 p.m. Thursday at Pagosa Lodge. If you're visiting and don't know where the 
Lodge is, go west from town, up the hill, past the traffic signal at the top 
and down hill to the Lodge on your right.</p> 
<p>If you play volleyball, croquet, or pitch horseshoes, there will be 
competitions you can enter. Known as a blowhard? The watermelon seed-spitting 
contest may hold your prize. There'll also be a three-legged race, egg race, 
potato passing, ping pong ball hunt, bobbing for apples and a patriotic theme 
costume contest. They're all open to everyone.</p> 
<p>Food service will begin at 5 p.m. with traditional country fair on the 
menu. A plate with entree, chips or potato salad, corn on the cob, potato 
salad, cole slaw or baked beans and condiments will cost $8.50 per person, 
$7.50 for seniors, and children under 10 will eat free. There'll be dessert 
treats galore, soda, water, beer and a full bar will be available.</p> 
<p>But it won't end there.</p> 
<p>If you've never heard the Pagosa Hot Strings play, you've got a treat 
waiting for you, perhaps the highlight of your visit. They'll demonstrate their 
fancy picking and singing from 6-8 p.m. and then the stage will open to dancing 
with Rio Jazz providing the beat.</p> 
<p>Those of you interested in quilting, the right patterns, the proper 
stitches, the prize-winning outcome, will want to go over to Mamie Lynch Gym at 
Pagosa Springs Junior High School for Quilt Fest 2002. Use the entrance off 
Lewis Street just north of 4th Street.</p> 
<p>You'll find prize winning quilts of every design and size in a show 
starting at noon Thursday and 10 a.m. the next two days. It's all the work of 
Pagosa Piecemakers Quilt Club. A special feature will be the Christmas Corner, 
chock full of holiday items to tempt those dreams of winter, snow and its 
eventual melt and runoff.</p> 
<p>Or, maybe you're into other forms of country celebration. How about rodeo?
</p> 
<p>The 53rd annual Red Ryder Roundup kicks off at 2 p.m. Thursday at the rodeo 
arena southeast of town. Go east to the intersection of U.S. 160 and U.S. 84, 
follow 84 to the top of the hill and then go east on Mill Creek Road. Off-road 
parking will be available in the area and members of the local Mounted Rangers 
Troop and other personnel will direct you.</p> 
<p>You'll see riding, roping, and foot-stomping action in all the regular 
rodeo events and there'll be entertainment by Montie Montana Jr., a longtime 
friend of Fred Harman, creator of the Red Ryder comic strip for whom the rodeo 
was named and who was instrumental in its early development. Besides, he was a 
county resident, living in the Blanco Basin.</p> 
<p>Montana brings a relaxed talk format, telling tales of the West and his 
experiences, throws in a cowboy song or two and keeps audiences riveted while 
doing rope tricks during his presentation. He's no novice. He's appeared on the 
Grand Ol' Opry out of Nashville, in the television series &quot;Gunsmoke&quot; 
and has guided Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show to 26 countries around the globe.
</p> 
<p>There'll be calf scrambles, mutton busting events and prize animals drawing 
raves from the crowds. You like bareback riding? We've got it. Saddle bronc 
riding? Got that, too. Brahma bull riding or steer wrestling? Come on out. Team 
roping, barrel racing? Yep, they're there, too.</p> 
<p>Before each day's rodeo the Parelli Natural Horse-Man-Ship Savvy Team will 
demonstrate the horse training techniques that have brought worldwide fame to 
the Parelli facility here. You might want to get the grounds a tad early just 
to see how they work with their animals. Starting times are 2 p.m. Thursday and 
6 p.m. Friday and Saturday.</p> 
<p>It still isn't over. A new feature this year will come at 1 p.m. Sunday 
when the ranching form of rodeo takes over with Jackpot Saddle Team Roping. 
This is a head and heel roping event with riders unleashing lassos in 
competition for cash and a special saddle.</p> 
<p>If all that fun's not your piece of pie, try some of our local restaurants, 
visit the shops, look for bargains and you'll learn why Pagosa visitors always 
go away thinking &quot;Now that's a friendly town.&quot;</p> 
<p>Keep your eye on the fun and we're sure you'll find something to your 
liking in this community which lives up to its motto: The Best of Colorado.</p>

<p><b>We have a 30 percent chance of receiving holiday rain</b></p> 
<p>By John M. Motter</p> 
<p>Staff Writer</p> 
<p>Locally, there is a 30-percent chance for afternoon rain and thundershowers 
Thursday, Friday and Saturday of this week, according to Brian Avery, a 
forecaster for the National Weather Service Grand Junction office.</p> 
<p>Sunday and Monday rain is possible, but the probability decreases.</p> 
<p>High temperatures through the coming week should be in the 85 to 90 degree 
range, according to Avery, with low temperatures ranging between 45 and 55 
degrees.</p> 
<p>The shift toward monsoon rains has probably started, Avery said. By 
mid-July, Pagosa Country could be receiving its seasonal quota of monsoon 
rains. As the term is used locally, don't expect torrential downpours as occur 
in India. Do expect daily afternoon showers.</p> 
<p>Pagosa Springs received only 0.05 inches of rain during June. </p> 
<p>Historically, Pagosa Springs receives an average of 0.91 inches of rain 
during June, 1.63 inches during July, 2.52 inches in August, 1.89 inches during 
September, and 2.03 inches in October. The worst local floods historically take 
place during October.</p> 
<p>The mean high temperature for the month just completed was 84.5 degrees. 
The historic average maximum mean June temperature is 78.5 degrees. The record 
mean high June temperature is 85.5 degrees, recorded in 1946.</p> 
<p>The highest June temperature ever recorded was 98 degrees, June 12, 1946. 
The highest June temperature this year was 91 degrees June 30, the last day of 
the month.</p> 
<p>High temperatures last week ranged between 85 and 91 degrees with an 
average high reading of 88 degrees. Low temperatures ranged between 45 and 50 
degrees with an average low reading of 47 degrees. The historic average mean 
June temperature is 57.6 degrees.</p>

<p>The parks are alive and well, and ready for the annual holiday events. 
Towmn Park and Centennial Park will be full of fun and games with the annual 
carnival and the Chamber of Commerce arts and crafts fair. Come join the fun as 
Pagosa celebrates the biggest town event of the year.</p> 
<p>South Pagosa Park on South 8th Street is busy as crews work on the addition 
of skateboard ramps. The skateboard area is expected to be ready for weekend 
use.</p> 
<p>Thanks to numerous volunteers, headed up by a very ambitious John King, for 
all your volunteer hours and to all the people donating time to help us provide 
the kids a place to skate.</p> 
<p>Baseball</p> 
<p>The season for most little league baseball players is now over, concluding 
with the picnic pot luck Saturday as a final tribute to the coaches and players 
for a very successful season. Our programs are only as good as the volunteers, 
so I would like everyone to thank a coach when you see them. They put in 
countless hours for our youths.</p> 
<p>Some of our older youth baseball players will start a double-elimination 
tournament next week, with an all-star team selected from the 9-10 age group 
participating. Following that, an all-star team will be picked to represent 
Pagosa Springs in the annual Monte Vista Invitational.</p> 
<p>Fishing</p> 
<p>The ponds behind the River Center have been stocked and are ready for 
action. We had over 150 parents and children at our annual fishing derby. The 
Division of Wildlife team has never seen such a turnout. Everyone had fun and 
cannot wait until next year's event.</p> 
<p>Fourth of July</p> 
<p>The park department and Park Fun Program will have a booth at the Pagosa 
Lodge during the community picnic and concert, featuring games for children 
through age 12. Come join the fun. Games start at 3 p.m. and continue to about 
6 p.m.</p>

</b> 
<p></p> 
<p>By Crista Munro</p> 
<p>Special to The PREVIEW</p> 
<p>If you've been following Nickel Creek's career for the past year, you may 
have been wondering to yourself if these young adults (who have played every 
single Four Corners Folk Festival) would be back.</p> 
<p>After all, they now have two Top-10 videos on the Country Music Channel and 
numerous Grammy, International Bluegrass Music Association and Country Music 
Association awards and nominations under their collective belt.</p> 
<p>Festival organizers wondered themselves, until the band's management 
company called last fall to express the band's dedication to their 
&quot;hometown festival,&quot; and a guarantee that Nickel Creek would again be 
back in Pagosa Springs this Labor Day weekend.</p> 
<p>&quot;Bluegrass Revivalists,&quot; &quot;Acoustic Innovators,&quot; 
&quot;Youthgrass&quot; &#138; these are just some of the terms that have been 
used to describe Nickel Creek during the past year. Regardless of 
classification, the band's self-titled debut album has been experiencing the 
kind of grassroots sales (more than 500,000 to date) that is rarely seen in 
their genre.</p> 
<p>Since the release of that album over a year ago, Nickel Creek has held a 
Top-20 spot on Billboard's Country Album chart, appeared on the &quot;Tonight 
Show with Jay Leno,&quot; sold out venues across the country, been featured on 
a CMT documentary, named in Time Magazine as one of five Music Innovators for 
the Millennium and featured in the Sunday New York Times with the headline 
&quot;Bluegrass That Can Twang And Be Cool Too &#138;&quot;</p> 
<p>To have achieved all these honors is a great accomplishment for a musician

<p> </p> <b>Pagosa man carves trail down Martinez Canyon</b> 
<p></p> 
<p>By Tess Noel Baker</p> 
<p>Staff Writer</p> 
<p>How does a person move a mountain? One rock at a time.</p> 
<p>It's possible, and Jack Passant has proved it. He's spent three years - 
with a six-foot crowbar and a shovel - constructing his own set of switchbacks 
down to the bottom of Martinez Canyon.</p> 
<p>At 69, he said, he can walk forever on flat surfaces or downhill, but the 
uphill scramble was becoming too much, and he wanted to be able to enjoy his 
views of the canyon for a long time to come.</p> 
<p>The trail starts behind his home on Capitan Circle in Pagosa Lakes and 
slopes down gently to the bottom of the canyon, turning back on itself several 
times. All along the way, the path is lined with rocks, some smaller, others 
weighing hundreds of pounds. All were placed just so by Passant. The base of 
the trail is dirt, smooth and well packed, scooped in from the sides as he 
shifted the rock.</p> 
<p>The work was almost therapeutic, he said.</p> 
<p>&quot;Some days, in three or four hours I'd move one lousy rock,&quot; he 
said. &quot;But when I was finished, it was exactly where I wanted it.&quot;</p>
<p>Passant had some false starts, switchbacks that hit a dead end. And, of 
course, he had to avoid killing any aspen tress, per his wife, Sue's, 
instruction. Otherwise, the project went fairly smoothly. Only one rock ever 
knocked him off his feet, and he learned quickly things go faster if the rocks 
move downhill rather than up.</p> 
<p>He even added a separate trail that dead ends in a nice flat spot he made 
especially for tent camping. A tree shades the space and more rocks make a cozy 
bench for the Passants, their dog, LeRoy, or their two gray tabby cats.</p> 
<p>It just goes to show, Passant said, that you can do anything if given the 
time.</p> 
<p>And don't forget the crowbar.</p> 
<p> </p> <b>Irrigating costs are no drop in the bucket</b> 
<p></p> 
<p>By John M. Motter</p> 
<p>Staff Writer</p> 
<p>Level 2 water restrictions remain in effect for customers using water 
supplied by the Pagosa Area Water and Sanitation District.</p> 
<p>That means limiting outside watering to once a week between the hours of 8 
p.m. and midnight. It also means paying extra - a lot extra - for water used in 
excess of 8,000 gallons per month per equivalent unit.</p> 
<p>In addition to the Level 2 restrictions, the district has initiated a 
temporary $5.25 charge to be levied on each water service amount. That 
surcharge will be included on the July water bill which contains June water 
services. At the end of August, need for the temporary surcharge will be 
reviewed.</p> 
<p>The surcharge is being levied to compensate for unexpected pumping costs 
connected with the drought, according to district officials. Only water pumped 
from the San Juan River south of town is being added to the system at the 
present time.</p> 
<p>That water is being pumped to the San Juan water treatment plant located at 
the district's Vista subdivision complex. Involved are two pumping systems, 
each capable of moving one million gallons of water per day. Water in each of 
the conduit systems is propelled by three electric pumps.</p> 
<p>District officials envisioned the diversion as a means of augmenting the 
system already in place. As such, they anticipated running the pumps about six 
hours a day and budgeted about $35,000 for that purpose this year.</p> 
<p>Early in the year it became apparent the reservoirs supplying the existing 
water treatment system were low, presenting the possibility of running dry 
before the end of the year. To hedge against that possibility, the district 
began running the south San Juan diversion pumps 24 hours a day, seven days a 
week. When the diversion water wasn't going into the new treatment plant at 
Vista to supply day-to-day needs, it was, and is, pumped into Lake Forest where 
it is retained for future consumption.</p> 
<p>The cost for electricity to power the 75-horsepower motors driving the 
pumps is about $500 per day for around-the-clock operation.</p> 
<p>In addition, the district is in the process of purchasing and installing a 
third conduit system between the southerly San Juan diversion point and the San 
Juan treatment plant. That system will require three additional pumps, will 
increase pumping capacity at that point to three million gallons per day, and 
will add to the $500 per day pumping cost.</p> 
<p>The cost of pumping water from the south San Juan diversion point to the 
treatment plant and Lake Forest will exceed the budgeted line item for that 
purpose by more than $200,000, according to water district officials. Also 
included are anticipated costs for operating new pumps to send water to Hatcher 
Lake and from Lake Forest to the San Juan treatment plant. The extra pumping 
costs are the reason for the $5.25 surcharge. Pumping costs connected with this 
calculation were provided by La Plata Electric, according to Carrie Campbell, 
the water district general manager.</p> 
<p>Calculating the timing when users have to start paying Level 2 extra 
consumption increases is a little less obvious, according to Campbell. Through 
it all, Level 2 restrictions took effect Monday.</p> 
<p>Water bills mailed out the first part of July will increase, but it won't 
be because of Level 2 increased consumption charges. July's residential bill 
will contain the standard $13.50 per month user fee plus the temporary $5.25 
surcharge. On top of that amount, the fee for consumption above 10,000 gallons 
will be added.</p> 
<p>Effective July 1 with the July/August billing cycle, the amount of 
residential consumption used as a basis for the $13.50 per month charged drops 
from 10,000 gallons per month to 8,000 gallons per month. New fees based on 
these changes will show up on the August bill. The district action creating 
this change took place April 2 and has nothing to do with Level 2 water 
rationing.</p> 
<p>These extra consumption charges are: 8,001 gallons to 20,000 gallons - 
$3.50 per 1,000 gallons; over 20,001 gallons - $4.50 per 1,000 gallons.</p> 
<p>The September bill will reflect Level 2 water rationing charges for 
consumption above 8,000 gallons per month. These charges are: 8,001 gallons to 
20,000 gallons - $14 per 1,000 gallons; 20,001 to 30,000 gallons - $22.50 per 
1,000 gallons; 30,001 to 40,000 gallons - $27 per 1,000 gallons; 40,001 to 
50,000 gallons - $31.50 per thousand gallons; and usage above 50,001 gallons - 
$90 per thousand gallons.</p> 
<p>Underlying the timing for water consumption is the timing for meter 
reading. Water meters are read between the 19th and the 26th of each month. 
Most readings are completed around the 20th of the month. Water bills contain 
consumption after the 20th of any month and up to the 20th of the succeeding 
month. For example, the July bill covers consumption from about May 20 through 
June 20.</p> 
<p>The district has initiated several short-range actions designed to mitigate 
the current drought. These steps involve the purchase of about $150,000 worth 
of electrical pumps, appurtenances, and making electrical connections. One set 
of pumps will be used to increase the flow from the San Juan River to the 
treatment plant from 2 million to 3 million gallons per day.</p> 
<p>Another pump will be used to move water from the Vista site to the Hatcher 
Lake water distribution system, thereby saving the water remaining in Hatcher 
for future consumption. A pump will be installed to move water from Lake Forest 
to the Vista treatment plant in case the San Juan River runs dry.</p> 
<p>If the San Juan River runs dry, water from the Vista plant may be supplying 
all users, including the town of Pagosa Springs.</p> 
<p>Several long-range measures designed to mitigate drought conditions are 
being considered.</p> 
<p>The first of these is the encasement of Dutton Ditch. Dutton Ditch supplies 
raw water to Hatcher Lake and Stevens Reservoir, supply basins for the Hatcher 
and Stevens water treatment plants. Encasing Dutton Ditch will allow additional 
time to replace water in these reservoirs. In addition, losses due to ditch 
bank blowout will be avoided. Future enlargement of Stevens Reservoir is 
anticipated. Plans are also being stepped up to make better use of all of the 
Pagosa Lakes lakes as storage reservoirs.</p> 
<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p> 
<p><b>Level 2 water schedule</b></p> 
<p>The following Level 2 water schedule was enacted by PAWS with a July 1 
effective date. Watering is allowed only one day a week between 8 p.m. and 
midnight on the appropriate day. The appropriate day is determined from the 
house addresses as follows:</p> 
<p>Sunday 1 through 99</p> 
<p>Monday 100 through 199</p> 
<p>Tuesday 200 through 299</p> 
<p>Wednesday 300 through 399</p> 
<p>Thursday 400 through 499</p> 
<p>Friday 500 through 599 </p> 
<p>Saturday 600 and up</p> 
<p>Penalties for violating water restrictions are: initial offense - warning; 
first citation - $100; second citation - $250; third and subsequent citations - 
$500.</p> 
<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p> <b>County keeps building at a record pace despite drought
</b> 
<p></p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>By John M. Motter</p> 
<p>Staff Writer</p> 
<p>New homes are going up at an unprecedented pace in Archuleta County, 
according to a report just released by the county building department.</p> 
<p>According to figures collected up to May 31, this year leads all others in 
total number of permits issued - 242 - followed by 2000 with 240. Next in line 
are 1999 and 2001 when a total of 197 permits were issued each year.</p> 
<p>The department issued 150 single-family residential permits by June 1 this 
year, topping the previous high of 146 such permits issued by June of 2000, 
according to the report.</p> 
<p>&quot;I'm not sure what caused the April and May jump,&quot; said Julie 
Rodriguez, supervisor of the building permit department. &quot;It might have 
been the fee change process Pagosa Area Water and Sanitation District went 
through earlier this year. Maybe some of the builders were getting started 
before PAWs fees went up.&quot;</p> 
<p>The district's new capital investment fee became effective April 2, 
according to Carrie Campbell, district general manager, therefore no one 
purchasing a building permit during April or May could have avoided it.</p> 
<p>The building surge nevertheless seems to be making an impact on the 
district. &quot;We're issuing at least two new connects a day,&quot; Campbell 
said. &quot;We're scheduled up to mid-August on new connections. It looks to me 
as if this could be a record year for new connections.&quot;</p> 
<p>Campbell speculated that unusually mild weather experienced in Archuleta 
County over the past few years may be encouraging the building boom.</p> 
<p>A lot of so-called &quot;spec houses&quot; are being built, according to 
Rodriguez. Spec houses are houses built, then put on the market for sale, as 
opposed to homes built to order for a particular customer. &quot;One builder 
from Grand Junction has obtained permits for 13 spec houses this year,&quot; 
she said.</p> 
<p>The square footage of homes is increasing this year, Rodriguez said. 
&quot;I mean the square footage of average homes. We are getting a few huge, 
multi-million dollar homes, but the size of average homes seems to be going 
over 3,000 square feet.&quot;</p> 
<p>The number of mobile homes permits issued this year is 18, considerably 
fewer than the 23 mobile homes permits issued by June 1, 2000. Modular homes of 
various types are included in the single family residential category, and not 
in the mobile home category.</p> 
<p>Commercial building permits to date this year also trail 2000. Only three 
commercial permits have been issued this year. That total was five in 2000.</p> 
<p>In the other category, 71 permits have been issued this year, compared with 
59 other permits during the first five months of 2000. Other permits is a 
catch-all category including adding rooms, carports, porches, patios, and other 
major improvements to existing buildings.</p> 
<p>Timeshares, the final category, received no new permits this year. During 
2000, seven timeshare permits were issued through May 31.</p> 
<p> </p> <b>County keeps building at a record pace despite drought</b> 
<p></p> 
<p>By John M. Motter</p> 
<p>Staff Writer</p> 
<p>A request for an exception to subdivision regulations because of 
&quot;these extraordinary times,&quot; prompted the Archuleta County 
commissioners to arrange a meeting involving representatives of the land 
development community and county planning staff.</p> 
<p>The request for special treatment was made during the regular Tuesday 
morning meeting of county commissioners. On the table was an agenda item titled 
&quot;Improvements agreement for Colorado Timber Ridge Phase IV.&quot;</p> 
<p>Early in the discussion concerning Timber Ridge, the commissioners 
unanimously approved an improvements agreement and a security bond amounting to 
$791,057, and gave conditional approval to the final plat for Timber Ridge 
Phase IV.</p> 
<p>The commissioners then listened to a request that the developer be allowed 
to sell lots in Phase IV, even though the improvements have not been completed 
to allow the final plat to be filed with the county clerk and recorder.</p> 
<p>County subdivision regulations do not allow developers to sell lots until a 
final plat of the development is recorded. The final plat cannot be recorded 
until all improvements are completed.</p> 
<p>Colorado Timber Ridge Ranch is a California Limited Partnership owned by 
Joseph Machock. Representing Machock before the commissioners was Richard 
Gustafson of Gustafson Consulting. Included in the packet of documents 
concerning the Timber Ridge proposal was a letter from Mike Mitchell, managing 
broker for the developer, urging the commissioners to allow sale of the lots 
immediately.</p> 
<p>Speaking directly on behalf of Timber Ridge was local attorney Jerry Venn.
</p> 
<p>&quot;These are extraordinary times that call for extraordinary 
action,&quot; Venn said.</p> 
<p>The fire on Missionary Ridge has worked a severe hardship on Timber Ridge, 
according to Venn, because road construction crews and equipment expected to 
work within the development have gone to Durango to fight the fire. So has much 
other heavy equipment from this community, Venn said.</p> 
<p>Consequently, Timber Ridge will not be able to complete road construction 
until next year, Venn said. </p> 
<p>Venn asked for a waiver, a variance, &quot;we want a variance today,&quot; 
allowing Timber Ridge to sell lots immediately. The expression for selling lots 
used by Timber Ridge, as contained in Mitchell's letter, &quot;to close 
escrows,&quot; refers to the practice of Timber Ridge and other developers of 
selling lots and holding the proceeds in escrow until the final plat is filed. 
</p> 
<p>Arguments used by Venn to encourage immediate action by the commissioners 
included: sale of the lots benefits the local economy; Timber Ridge will post 
reasonable security in whatever amount and form the commissioners require; 
Timber Ridge is reliable as evidenced by performance during the first three 
phases of the development.</p> 
<p>&quot;I believe you can grant this without going to the planning commission 
for their recommendation,&quot; Venn said. &quot;I believe this is outside of 
planning commission purview.&quot;</p> 
<p>Venn later recommended that the county use &quot;developer-to-developer 
flexibility,&quot; and that more than one standard be established for 
developers recognizing the high level of performance and financial 
responsibility shown by developers such as Timber Ridge.</p> 
<p>The commissioners spoke with one voice in denying the Timber Ridge request 
for an immediate variance. All agreed that existing regulations do not permit 
the commissioners to grant a variance without going through the variance 
process defined in county law.</p> 
<p>They divided on the next step, the step which ended with instructions to 
the county planning staff to meet tomorrow with developers in search of an 
answer to their perceived problem.</p> 
<p>Bill Downey, chairman of the board of county commissioners, agreed to look 
at arguments concerning the issue, but said he is skeptical and '&quot;will 
have to be convinced.&quot;</p> 
<p>&quot;I agree we are in extraordinary times,&quot; Downey said. &quot;We're 
in a drought the likes of which we have not seen before.&quot;</p> 
<p>The Pagosa Area Water and Sanitation District is having trouble keeping up 
with demands created by growth, Downey said. A lot of people think no more 
growth should be allowed because of the additional strains placed on the water 
supply, Downey added.</p> 
<p>After pointing out he thinks current regulations are good and workable, and 
that granting a variance to Timber Ridge will set a precedent that other 
developers will want to follow, Downey said, &quot;This board is responsible 
for protecting the county as a whole. If that places a burden on developers, so 
be it.&quot;</p> 
<p>Commissioner Alden Ecker pointed out the commissioners are responsible for 
protecting the citizens of the county, and recalled numerous instances in the 
past when that wasn't done and &quot;the people of the county are still 
paying.&quot;</p> 
<p>Ecker agreed that current county rules cannot be ignored and that approval 
of the variance is not possible unless the rules are changed.</p> 
<p>&quot;I don't know if we have double jeopardy here or not,&quot; Ecker 
pointed out. He then said he is not opposed to reviewing the law and did not 
see why sufficient bond would not be adequate.</p> 
<p>&quot;I agree with the other two commissioners,&quot; said Commissioner 
Gene Crabtree. &quot;We can't go against the existing laws. I propose that the 
developers sit down with planning staff as soon as possible, maybe Thursday, 
and work something out.&quot; </p> 
<p>Crabtree then asked other developers in the audience to speak up. Jim 
Mudroch of Elk Park Meadows and Nancy Ray of Fairfield Communities, Inc., spoke 
in favor of discussing changes to subdivision laws.</p> 
<p>When Crabtree asked if anyone in the audience wanted to speak against 
changing the law, no one answered.</p> 
<p>Bonding agent Tim Blanchard also spoke in favor of changing the law.</p> 
<p>&quot;You're talking about private land,&quot; Blanchard said to the 
commissioners. &quot;What do you care if someone half finishes a subdivision, 
then leaves without finishing.&quot; </p> 
<p>Machock, the Timber Ridge owner, observed that if he could have 30 minutes 
Friday with Director of County Development Greg Comstock, an agreement could be 
worked out. </p> 
<p>When Downey suggested that planning staff will have to abandon other 
projects if they switch to this one, Machock said it had been his experience 
that developers sometimes pay overtime expenses incurred by staff.</p> 
<p>Without taking a vote, apparently by silent agreement among the 
commissioners, county planning staff was instructed to meet with the developers 
Friday to see what might be worked out.</p> 
<p>At issue will be the contention by some developers that county subdivision 
requirements concerning the completion of improvements are overly restrictive.
</p> 
<p>Among the improvements required by the county are roads, sidewalks and 
utilities. An improvements agreement is a contract between the developer and 
the county wherein the developer agrees to complete specified improvements 
according to county law, usually within two years of signing the improvements 
agreement. As additional surety, the developer is required to post a 
performance bond or other guarantee acceptable to the county that will be 
forfeited to the county should the improvements not be completed as agreed upon.
</p> 
<p>In addition to the agreement and the performance bond, the county requires 
all improvements be completed and accepted by the county before the final plat 
of the development is officially recorded by the county clerk and recorder.</p> 
<p>Finally, title cannot be transferred from the developer to a buyer until 
the final plat is recorded. </p> 
<p>The county has argued that county laws on this issue are necessary. The 
bond is necessary, officials said, in case the developer goes broke or for some 
other reason leaves without completing all of the improvements. In that event, 
the county can cash in the forfeited security and use the proceeds to complete 
the improvements. A second county option is to use the bond proceeds to restore 
the property to its original state.</p> 
<p>Collection of bond money could require some time, even years. A lawsuit 
with a bonding company could develop. To this point in time, the county has 
insisted on the ultimate guarantee, that the work be completed before title to 
property is transferred.</p>

<p></p> 
<p>By John M. Motter</p> 
<p>Staff Writer</p> 
<p>A $4.2 million bid for upgrading the Vista wastewater treatment plant was 
accepted by the Pagosa Area Water and Sanitation District board of directors 
Tuesday night.</p> 
<p>Southwest Contracting of Cortez was low bidder in competition with four 
other firms, Bradbury Stamm Construction of Albuquerque, FCI Construction of 
Durango, Triad Western of Cortez, and Weaver General Construction of Englewood. 
The losing bids ranged between $5.3 and $5.8 million.</p> 
<p>The bids were reviewed for the district by the engineering firm of Kamp 
Dresser and McKee. That firm's engineering cost estimate was $5.4 million.</p> 
<p>&quot;Work should begin by Aug. 1,&quot; said Gene Tautges, district 
assistant manager. &quot;We have some paper work and some prep details to get 
out of the way first.&quot;</p> 
<p>Work on the facility should be completed during the summer of 2003, 
according to Tautges.</p> 
<p>When completed, plant capacity will be increased from today's 1.1 million 
gallons per day to 3.9 mgd. </p> 
<p>Even though an ultra-modern, ultraviolet disinfectant process will be 
installed, the plant's discharge quality limits will continue to be 30 
milligrams per liter of total dissolved solids and a maximum of 45 milligrams 
per liter of biodegradable oxygen. The biodegradable oxygen demand average 
limit is 30 milligrams per liter. The plant's effluent is discharged into 
Stollsteimer Creek and ultimately reaches the Piedra River. </p> 
<p>The project contemplates renovating the old plant, as well as making new 
additions. The additions will be completed first, enabling continuous operation 
while the old plant is shut down for renovation.</p> 
<p>Financing for the project comes from the $5 million general obligation bond 
approved by voters in May. Bond sales should be completed within the next two 
weeks.</p> 
<p>A countywide ban on fireworks and open fires could delay some blasting 
connected with the project.</p> 
<p>Upgrading of the sewage treatment plant is one of the projects consulting 
engineers recommend under the district's 20-year capital improvement plan.</p> 
<p> </p> <b>Road to Recovery - pride in community service</b> 
<p></p> 
<p>By Patricia Waters</p> 
<p>Special to The SUN</p> 
<p>Pagosa Springs has had a Road to Recovery program for approximately four 
years and it provides cancer patients in the community with rides to Durango 
for their treatments. The Road to Recovery Volunteer Driver Program is a 
national program affiliated with the American Cancer Society.</p> 
<p>The local program was organized after two events. When Patty Sterling 
returned to Pagosa Springs after cancer surgery in Dallas she was prescribed 
six weeks of radiation treatments. With the closest center located in Durango, 
Patty and her husband, Lee, were about to undertake many miles of driving. </p> 
<p>To help, Patty's good friend, Judy Wood, contacted mutual friends to assist 
with the driving. This was so successful that Lee had to wait 10 days for his 
turn to drive.</p> 
<p>Subsequently, Lee had to undergo radiation treatment. Patty called friends, 
and again the community responded. Lee had drivers for each treatment day. 
During this time, Lee contacted Jean Bruscia of the American Cancer Society and 
learned there was a national program, and she encouraged him to start a program 
here in Pagosa Springs.</p> 
<p>Lee advises that the community, including the Chamber of Commerce, KWUF 
radio, the mayor, sheriff and the fire district, fully supported the venture 
and in no time they had approximately 35 enthusiastic volunteers.</p> 
<p>Lee ran this program for several years. After he suffered a heart attack he 
passed the reins to Mamie Lynch. Lee and Patty continue their involvement in 
the program as drivers.</p> 
<p>On July 1 Gerda Witkamp and Patricia Waters took over coordinating the 
program from Mamie Lynch who, after running the program for the past several

<p> </p> <b>Letters</b> <b>Inverted siphons</b> 
<p>Dear Editor:</p> 
<p>Now it's pay-up time for not planning ahead. A suggestion was made to the 
water officials in the '80s that they needed to construct inverted siphons to 
stop the sliding problem with the city water line on U.S. 160 and other places.
</p> 
<p>But the water manager (being smarter than the average bear) said it would 
not work. The agriculture industries use inverted siphons all over southwestern 
Colorado to get their irrigation water. An inverted siphon takes water from one 
side of the valley to the other side in an underground pipeline.</p> 
<p>Now PAWS is pumping water at $500 a day when it could have had gravity flow 
from the San Juan to the lake system.</p> 
<p>And, with a little planning, more dams could have been built (which is a 
bad word).</p> 
<p>PAWS also keeps adding more area to its system to satisfy all the 
developers. Folks, there is a limit to water and land being cut up for more 
people. The problem is just a start because there are subdivided lots with no 
houses yet.</p> 
<p>Anyway, to all the enviros, wherever you live; be happy as you eat 
agricultural products, sleep in wood houses and drink water.</p>

<p><b>Bears on welfare</b></p> 
<p>Dear Editor:</p> 
<p>Yee-Ha! Here come the Democrats. Mothers, lock up your sons and hide your 
Bibles. They brought us Bill and Hillary, Al Gore, Gary Condit, Al Sharpton, 
Cynthia McKinney, Barbara Boxer, Barney Franks and a host of other 
embarrassments to themselves and this nation.</p> 
<p>Now comes the libelous Dr. Parker, who apparently wants to put the bears on 
welfare.</p> 
<p>That's some pretty innovative thinking from a bunch that hasn't had a new 
idea in over 40 years. But before the good doctor and his chums invest too much 
energy in this enterprise, someone should remind him that, unlike the Demo's 
other bought and paid for constituencies, bears can't vote.</p> 
<p>N. G. Constan</p> 
<p><b>Self sufficiency</b></p> 
<p>Dear Editor:</p> 
<p>The charge by Dr. Herbert Parker in his letter &quot;Zoning for bears&quot; 
that Democrats would prefer to feed bears while Republicans would not because 
of economic issues is one of the most preposterous and outrageous statements I 
have ever had the misfortune to read.</p> 
<p>I don't think Dr. Parker, or those who think like he, have a clue about 
wildlife management, controlling overpopulation and keeping disease and 
starvation to a minimum whether it be among bears or any other form of 
wildlife. As untasteful as it may seem, it is absolutely necessary to keep from 
feeding wild animals who are having difficulty scavenging for food.</p> 
<p>It is even said that feeding wild birds causes dependency on handouts, 
resulting in an inability to find natural food sources and leading to 
starvation for many. In cases of wildlife overpopulation, it may even be 
necessary to allow hunters and Division of Wildlife personnel to shoot excess 
animals to keep the surviving population as free from starvation and disease as 
possible. A quick death from a bullet is certainly more humane than a slow 
death from disease or starvation.</p> 
<p>There are educated, trained experts who know how best to deal with these 
problems just as there are experts in the management of our national forests. 
It is those who think like Dr. Parker who create bigger problems than they 
think they are qualified to solve.</p> 
<p>For example, consider the current terrible fires in our western forests. 
The state of Arizona spends, I am told, 43 percent of it's budget fighting 
environmentalists' lawsuits filed to prevent any cleanup of the forest floor, 
i.e., removal of brush, downed trees, small conifers.</p> 
<p>We are now reaping the harvest of such ignorance.</p> 
<p>As usual, the solution for the hand wringing, bleeding heart, &quot;touchy 
feely&quot; crowd is for the government to step in, locate these animals and 
feed them so they don't starve. Never mind that this would make these animals 
dependent on handouts and unable to fend for themselves as well as likely cause 
a population explosion.</p> 
<p>Is there a parallel with &quot;government solutions&quot; for humans in our 
society or what?</p> 
<p>Those who think like Dr. Parker seem to measure their success by how many 
people (or in this case animals) they can get onto government relief rolls. 
Those who think oppositely measure theirs by how many can be gotten off the 
rolls and into self sufficiency. Charles Darwin long ago pointed out how living 
things become strong, viable survivors through natural selection, 
&quot;survival of the fittest.&quot;</p> 
<p>I don't know what Dr. Parker's doctorate comprises, but it can't be one 
related to mine. If he is an MD, he ought to stick to his expertise. He and 
others like him should take time to educate themselves in ecology, biology, 
zoology, geology, botany, oceanography, meteorology and such. Maybe then their 
ideas will gain credibility. And maybe they will learn something.</p>

<p><b>A few questions</b></p> 
<p>Dear Editor:</p> 
<p>This is an open letter to the county commissioners and the Pagosa Area 
Water and Sanitation District directors.</p> 
<p>When Ralph Eaton started the (Pagosa Lakes) developments west of town, what 
do records show as to his estimate of people who could be served with water?</p>
<p>If all lots as now platted in the water district are built, how many people 
would have to be served?</p> 
<p>What do your projections show as the population of Archuleta County in the 
next 10 years?</p> 
<p>When the number of lots which can be served is exceeded, do you put a 
moratorium on building permits?</p> 
<p>What are current plans for building lake storage?</p> 
<p>Would your boards consider a Town Hall meeting to let the public know what 
your plans are for water for the foreseeable future?</p> 
<p>A couple of years after we moved to Pagosa in 1975, they did cloud seeding 
in the Pagosa area and it produced 800 inches of snow at Wolf Creek. Does the 
district still have authority to seed clouds?</p> 
<p>Does the District have the option of drilling deep wells to get water?</p> 
<p>The cities of Farmington, Albuquerque and Phoenix do not have water 
rationing while Pagosa, which is closer to the mountains and water supply, has 
a severe water shortage. Is this because we have not provided for storage?</p> 
<p>We would all feel much better if we knew you have the answers to these 
questions. We also know you cannot control the rain and snow, but you can start 
taking steps to store water.</p> 
<p>I know what a tough job you have and this letter is not written as a way of 
criticism, but only to find out what the plans are for the years ahead.</p> 
<p>Respectfully,</p> 
<p>Earl E. Hoover.</p> 
<p><b>Cloud seeding</b></p> 
<p>Dear Editor:</p> 
<p>Why are we not utilizing our resident cloud seeder to help relieve the fire 
danger?</p> 
<p>Why do the powers that be continue to make excuses?</p> 
<p>Action now is called for!</p> 
<p>Surely everyone in Archuleta County would be willing to say &quot;seed the 
clouds&quot; at any cost if it will save our forests and homes.</p> 
<p>Lightning strikes can happen any time. Careless and thoughtless people are 
here all the time. As a result, fires can happen any time.</p> 
<p>Cloud seeding has been done elsewhere in Colorado with great success.</p> 
<p>Expense? It's time to think outside the dollar bill and get some moisture 
into our forests before it's too late. Talk to our commissioners and let them 
know how important it is to you.</p> 
<p>They know who to talk to.</p>

<p><b>Chipper needed</b></p> 
<p>Dear Editor:</p>

limbs to the landfill. My neighbor has also hauled two loads.</p> 
<p>This is such a waste.</p> 
<p>The county should purchase a shredder/chipper and turn this brush into 
useful mulch for people to come and get. I know the county has a recycling 
program for Christmas trees, but isn't this more important?</p> 
<p>I would have gladly hauled my tree limbs to a recycling center rather than

<p><b>For this country</b></p> 
<p>Dear Editor:</p> 
<p>&quot;The natural progress of things is for liberty to yield and government 
to gain ground.&quot; When Thomas Jefferson offered that warning, he could not 
have known how much ground government would gain over the next two centuries.
</p> 
<p>As America celebrates 226 years of independence Thursday, the lessons of 
the founding Fathers bear remembering - lessons of limited government and 
individual liberty.</p> 
<p>No need to sour the holiday mood by pointing out how long the average 
American has to work to pay his taxes. And we won't even discuss the nearly $2 
trillion federal budget.</p> 
<p>But we will remember the men who wrote the Declaration of Independence. 
They were men of conviction who understood freedom and its costs. By signing 
that document, they subjected themselves to the revenge of the British 
government.</p> 
<p>Some of the 56 signers were captured by the British. They were tortured 
before they died. The British destroyed the homes of many others. Some fought 
and died in the war; a few lost sons to the cause.</p> 
<p>They took risks so they could enjoy their freedom and leave ours to us. We 
argue today about &quot;risky&quot; tax cuts and presidential legacies. We 
should remember that the founders made these arguments possible.</p> 
<p>The men who founded this nation and wrote our Constitution were indeed 
among the most brilliant who've ever lived. And were it not for the setting up 
of this nation with their recognition that freedom is the natural yearning of 
the created human spirit, created by God - not something granted by government 
- had it not been for that, then this experiment would not have worked. The 
founders understood - and this cannot be overemphasized - that freedom is not 
something granted by a government or by a sovereign. Freedom is granted by God.
</p> 
<p>The Founders said: Man's desire to speak freely is something with which he 
is created, and we are simply going to codify it. We are not establishing it, 
we are not creating it, we're not inventing, we're recognizing it.</p> 
<p>The brilliance of the men who founded this country, and the moral character 
of, especially, the early presidents - George Washington, John Adams and Thomas 
Jefferson - enabled America to be born in liberty. It's amazing when you stop 
to think about it, how precariously balanced this freedom is; how precariously 
balanced this country was in its early days; how precariously balanced it 
remains, in order for our national greatness to be the envy of the world.</p> 
<p>The Founders limited the role of the government in order for the people's 
dreams to be unlimited. The first 10 Amendments restrict the freedom of the 
government; they do not limit the freedom of the people. They protect God-given 
freedom, the secret of American greatness.</p> 
<p>Independence Day should be a solemn occasion to remember the risk and 
rewards inherent to freedom. Such reflection just might slow that natural 
progress of which Jefferson spoke so elegantly.</p> 
<p>Time to reflect America; it is your Independence Day.</p>

<p><b>Use ash trays</b></p> 
<p>Dear Editor:</p> 
<p>While driving along Park Avenue about 8:12 p.m. last Tuesday, we noticed a 
burning cigarette (Marlboro) lying on the pavement at the corner of Park and 
Talisman approximately 12 inches from some dry grass. My question to the idiot 
who was responsible for this act of stupidity: &quot;What were you 
thinking?&quot;</p> 
<p>Obviously you were not thinking. Based on the area where the cigarette was 
found, it's possible that the guilty party was someone from out of the area who 
is staying in one of the timeshares. However, as reported in this newspaper, it 
appears many of our locals are committing the same unconscionable act. Half of 
our beautiful state is on fire, and yet we still have people with an obvious IQ 
of 1 throwing their cigarettes out the windows of their vehicles.</p> 
<p>Ever wonder what the ash tray in your vehicle is for? With irresponsible 
acts such as this, our beautiful community could be the next Hayman or Durango 
fire. Citizens of Pagosa, be vigilant for people committing this act of 
stupidity and report them to authorities at once ... location, time, vehicle 
make, and license number.</p> 
<p>Gary Waples</p> 
<p><b>Saving water</b></p> 
<p>Dear Editor:</p> 
<p>With the ever worsening water shortage why don't all the restaurants in 
Pagosa Springs adopt the practice of serving water only on request? We have 
seen this practice in effect in other parts of the country when drought 
conditions exist. This may not make a huge difference in our current situation, 
but every little bit helps.</p> 
<p>In our home, we are also trying to do our &quot;bit.&quot; We are recycling 
water from our dishwasher and washing machine, collecting the cold water in the 
shower before it becomes warm, also using a bowl in the kitchen sink. All this 
saved water will be used to water our perennials and shrubs planted last year.
</p> 
<p>Our recycling efforts, however, do not provide enough to water our lawn, 
and in this time of extreme drought, when water should be saved, anyone using 
drinking quality water to keep a beautiful green lawn should be ashamed.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>  &nbsp; <b>Editorials</b> <b>Interdependence Day</b> 
<p></p> 
<p>Tomorrow, we celebrate Independence Day, recognizing the signing of the 
Declaration of Independence - a document establishing the separation of 
colonies from the British colonial power, signaling the intent to create a 
separate nation. The Fourth of July holiday gives us a chance to ponder the 
concept of independence, to wax poetic about its meaning and significance. It 
is an appropriate time for a certain amount of exaggeration and 
oversimplification; it is also a time for thoughtful sentiment, for renewed 
resolve.</p> 
<p>Independence Day this year occurs amid distinctly different circumstances 
than did recent Fourth of July holidays. During the last year, for the first 
time in a very long while, we were attacked on our own soil. We now find 
ourselves engaged in a war of an unprecedented kind, global in nature, in 
combat with enemies who are hard to locate, difficult to identify: lethal 
enemies, dedicated to our destruction.</p> 
<p>This year, we find many of our institutions under attack from within. We 
find the majority transformed into the minority, the basic standards by which 
many of us try to live weakened by political and economic self-interest, by 
judicial technicalities, by groups with revisionist agendas, by corporations 
whose officers lie, demolish the futures of stockholders and employees, and 
walk away with millions of unearned dollars.</p> 
<p>This is not a year for a pat reaction to our independence, for hollow 
propaganda.</p> 
<p>We have the privilege of living in the most prosperous, freest of cultures, 
of living at a level of comfort unknown by the ordinary people of history. The 
conditions that permit that existence are in jeopardy. We are in a battle with 
forces, internal and external, that seek to put an end to this wonderful nation 
and it is not in our collective interest to ignore this fact.</p> 
<p>The concept of independence, while reassuring to contemplate, is not enough 
to carry us to a successful conclusion in this fight.</p> 
<p>The Merriam Webster dictionary defines independence as &quot;not affiliated 
with a larger controlling unit, not regulated or relying on someone or 
something else ... not easily influenced, showing self-sufficiency and personal 
freedom.&quot;</p> 
<p>With this definition in mind, it is clear we are not independent as a 
nation and it is clear we cannot be purely independent as individuals if we 
desire to preserve our way of life.</p> 
<p>Our nation is affected by what happens in the rest of the world - 
economically and militarily. We cannot afford to sever our relationships with 
our friends and cannot hope to exist peacefully without allies. This involves 
compromise. We cannot exist without engaging and defeating our enemies. The 
activities of others help shape our actions. We do not live in a vacuum, 
independent.</p> 
<p>As individuals, if we learn from our nation's history, we cannot avoid 
reliance on, and trust in others of like mind. The personal freedoms we cherish 
are exercised in consort with our friends and neighbors, modulated in deference 
to common values keyed to the goals of self and national preservation. We 
cannot survive economically, spiritually or culturally without this reliance.
</p> 
<p>As we stand on the parade route tomorrow, watching Old Glory pass, we will 
give thanks that brave individuals signed a document to establish our nation in 
the face of oppression, to declare our nation's independence. We should also 
recognize, if we wish to flourish as a nation and thereby continue to exercise 
our freedoms as individuals, that July 4 is a time to be realistic, to accept 
the diverse backgrounds, characters and influences that come together under an 
umbrella of common principles in this wonderful experiment we call the United 
States of America. We should ask how we can strengthen ourselves, how we can 
work together to be honest and fair, to remain great and strong as a people, to 
nourish the ideas of freedom and responsibility, to preserve what we know and 
love.</p> 
<p>Tomorrow is Independence Day. It is also Interdependence Day. </p> 
<p>If we recognize this, the Fourth of July will be celebrated for generations 
to come.</p>

<p>SUN Columnist</p> 
<p>In honor of Independence Day, the Pagosa Lakes recreation center will be 
closed. Take a day off from your regular routine and spend the time supporting 
the many local events: the colorful parade which starts at 10 a.m., the all-day 
arts and crafts (and food) fair in Town and Centennial parks, and the 
traditional gathering of family and friends to share the evening meal, be it in 
your own backyard or elsewhere.</p> 
<p>Enjoy the day, celebrate our freedom, but be safe. No open fires, no 
firecrackers, no smoking outside ... in short, think before you do anything 
that could cause a fire in these dangerously dry and windy conditions.</p> 
<p>Lauren Lee asked that I thank the volunteers again for coming out on the 
morning of June 17 to help with the newsletter assembling and mailing to 
18,000-plus property owners who belong to PLPOA. Lauren deeply appreciated the 
help, especially since she had to leave that same afternoon to fly to New York 
for her beloved grandmothers' funeral.</p> 
<p>Looking for a fun new way to tone the abs, back, buttocks and thighs? 
Exercises done with a physio ball (also sometimes known as exercise ball, Swiss 
ball or fit-ball) represent a new twist in exercise technology. The secret is 
that since you are automatically balancing while exercising on the ball, your 
muscle activity is increased dramatically, leading to quicker results. I cannot 
speak to the quicker results, but I can tell you that is a lot of fun. It's 
challenging and it's good for a few laughs.</p> 
<p>Shonny Vanlandingham, our own world-class mountain biker, finds the physio 
ball a valuable tool to hone her already superb sense of balance. She kneels on 
the ball and catches a tennis ball that she bounces off the wall. Try it and 
have someone you trust videotape your attempts. If after months of hard work 
your balance still needs fine-tuning and you are sick of that squishy ball, you 
can then try to market that video clip to America's Funniest Videos.</p> 
<p>June Marquez is a certified aerobics instructor and she's very serious 
about this ball stuff. After 13 years of teaching people how to move various 
body parts to music, she's developed a full body workout on the physio ball 
that includes dumbbell training, stretching, toning, balancing and, oh yes, 
breathing techniques.</p> 
<p>People tend to forget to breathe when they are concentrating on not falling 
off the ball while pumping a set of dumbbells. Don't be intimidated. The class 
culture is such that you do what you can, knowing the body will become more 
cooperative as time goes by. Classes will begin, or more correctly, resume, 
after the July 4 shindigs, at 6:30 a.m. July 8 in the recreation center. Call

<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p> <b>Veterans Corner</b> <b>10 percent of county in veteran 
database</b> 
<p></p> 
<p><b>By Andy Fautheree</b></p> 
<p><b>SUN Columnist</b></p> 
<p>The Archuleta County Veterans Service Office reached a milestone last week. 
At least I think it is a milestone.</p> 
<p>As of last week, I now have over 1,000 Archuleta County veterans in the 
Veterans Service Office database. Considering that our county population is 
about 10,000, this represents 10 percent of the entire population as veterans 
that we know about. We don't know how many total veterans we have locally, but 
you can rest assured I will continue to do everything possible to make contact 
with them. Most of our veterans are eligible for VA benefits, in particular VA 
Health Care. Obviously the word is getting out.</p> 
<p>As I reported recently, this office averages contact with more than one new 
local veteran every day. Last week, for example I interviewed nine new 
veterans. The 1,000 veterans in the database include all veterans who have ever 
contacted this office in its entire history. When I took over the office the 
local veteran database count was about 745, as I recall. So this represents a 
25-percent growth in new veteran contacts.</p> 
<p>Another milestone reached this past week is that, as near as I can 
determine, we now have over 500 veterans enrolled in VA Health Care. This is 
according to the actual numbers supplied by Albuquerque VA Health Care system 
and the Grand Junction VA Care system. Considering the 1,000 veterans in the 
database include those who are deceased or have moved away, this means the 500 
veterans in the system from Archuleta County could represent much more than 50 
percent enrollment. The actual ratio is impossible to determine. Veterans move 
away frequently in our changing population and do not advise this office of the 
move.</p> 
<p>DD214 registration</p> 
<p>On another note, there are some new Colorado state regulations governing 
registration of veterans' DD214s with the county clerk. The military always 
recommends a discharged veteran record DD214 discharge papers with the local 
county clerk's office, in case the original is lost or destroyed. A copy of the 
DD214 is required for nearly all veteran benefits.</p> 
<p>I met with Archuleta County Clerk June Madrid last week and she advised me 
there are new regulations effective July 1 this year that address security 
concerns of Social Security numbers.</p> 
<p>Discharge papers usually show the veteran's Social Security number. When 
these documents are recorded with the county clerk's office, they are part of 
public information. It has been feared these Social Security numbers might be 
stolen for purposes other than those by the rightful possessor of that number.
</p> 
<p>Apparently, military DD214s are the only document recorded in the county 
clerk's records that contain Social Security numbers. With the new system and 
controls DD214s will no longer be available for public viewing. DD214 
information or copies will only be given to the veteran with proper 
identification or in the case of death, by the veteran's recognized next of kin.
</p> 
<p>The Veterans Service Office frequently takes care of this process of 
recording DD214s for the veteran. I keep a log of every DD214 when it goes out 
to the clerk's office and when it comes back to me, and when I send it out to 
the veteran, or when the veteran picks it up from this office. There is never a 
charge for any service to the veteran by this office.</p> 
<p>For information on these and other veteran benefits please call or stop by 
the Veterans Service Office located on the lower floor of the county 
courthouse. The office number is 264-2304, the fax number is 264-5949, and 
e-mail is afautheree@archuletacounty.org. The office is open 8 a.m.-4 p.m. 
Monday through Thursday, and Friday by appointment. Bring your DD Form 214 
(Discharge) for registration with the county, application for VA programs, and 
for filing in the VSO office.</p>

<p><b>Full slate of Fourth fun</b></p> 
<p><b>By Sally Hameister</b></p> 
<p>Since the real thing is out of the question this year, we have created our 
own fireworks with musicians and activities. Music just doesn't get any better 
than the Pagosa Hot Strings followed by Rio Jazz, and that is exactly what we 
are offering you in the way of our July 4 Concert.</p> 
<p>We are so honored and excited to have Pagosa's finest musicians joining us 
on this auspicious occasion, and we are sure that you won't want to miss a 
minute of this free concert beginning at 6 and ending sometime around 9:30-10 
p.m. We'll also provide an awesome surprise during the Hot Strings performance 
right around 7 p.m. that you simply won't want to miss.</p> 
<p>The party at Pagosa Lodge begins at 4:30 with games and events for every 
member of your family. There will be a contest for the most patriotic costumes 
in four age categories, so be sure to wear the red, white and blue.</p> 
<p>The Lodge will begin serving a picnic dinner with beef barbecue brisket, 
sausages, corn on the cob, potato salad, baked beans, cole slaw, cookies and 
brownies at around 5. Adults are $8.50, seniors $7.50 and kids 10 and under eat 
free. I would say that these are extremely friendly family prices. Also 
available will be iced tea, sodas, beer, bottled water and wine coolers.</p> 
<p>Games will be going on from 4:30 and will include a watermelon 
seed-spitting contest, volleyball, croquet, a three-legged race, sack race, 
bobbing for apples, egg toss and, rumor has it, you can catch a tethered 
balloon ride or even a canoe ride. It promises to be a real All-American family 
July 4 celebration at Pagosa Lodge, so please join us for all the fun and games.
</p> 
<p>Please check out the full-page ad in this issue of The SUN for all the July 
4 events starting with the ever-popular Rotary Parade beginning at 10 a.m. with 
over 100 entries showing their stuff beginning at South 8th Street and ending 
at 2nd Street. Grab your space real early because the streets are packed with 
patriots awaiting the parade.</p> 
<p>The Park to Park Arts and Crafts Festival will be the place to go right 
after the parade to check out around 100 vendors and their unique, handmade 
merchandise. There will also be plenty of food to give you the strength to 
visit each and every booth. For the first time ever, the Pagosa Springs Humane 
Society will be there with a beer booth in case you develop a hankerin' for a 
brew. The vendors will be there for four days, July 4-7, so you will have 
plenty of time to shop and munch in both Town Park and Centennial Park.</p> 
<p>You'll also want to see all the wonderful things the Pagosa Piecemakers 
will offer at the Mamie Lynch Gymnasium July 4-6.</p> 
<p>And, of course, be sure to make a trip to the Red Ryder Roundup for regular 
rodeo performances July 4-6 and a newly-added roping event July 7.</p> 
<p>It promises to be a fabulous Fourth and I'm guessing that with the great 
party we have planned out at Pagosa Lodge, no one will much miss the fireworks.
</p> 
<p>Join us for a wonderful day.</p> 
<p>Firefighter shirts</p> 
<p>Todd Shelton of Century 21 fame has come up with a fabulous idea to benefit 
all the local and regional firefighters who are working daily keep us all out 
of harm's way.</p> 
<p>He has ordered special T-shirts that will go on sale July 4 prior to, 
during and after the parade. Todd will have his helpers moving through the 
crowds wearing these shirts and selling them for a $15 donation, (or more, if 
you choose) and we will also have them available at a table in Town Park after 
the parade and at the picnic and concert at Pagosa Lodge that afternoon.</p> 
<p>We encourage everyone to wear these shirts throughout the day to show our 
collective support to these wonderful people who put their lives on the line 
every day for us. Should we run out of shirts, we will have order forms 
available for those who would like them.</p> 
<p>These shirts have an amazing picture of two firefighters on the back with 
&quot;In Our Firefighters We Trust!&quot; One of the sleeves will sport an 
American flag with &quot;Pagosa Springs, Colorado - 2002&quot;.</p> 
<p>Proceeds from shirt sales will go into a special fund set up at the Bank of 
the San Juans to support our local firefighters in their efforts to control the 
wildfires which have affected our area.</p> 
<p>Please help Todd and Pagosa Springs support our firefighters with your 
donations and wearin' of the shirt. Anyone who would like to make a donation is 
welcome to do so at the Chamber of Commerce. We will also be happy to take 
orders for more shirts, and you can always call us at 264-2360 with questions. 
I applaud Todd for taking such positive measure to honor those who must be so 
exhausted by now, but continue to protect us every day.</p> 
<p>Steinberg reception</p> 
<p>Jeff Laydon at Pagosa Photography invites you to join him for a July 5

<p>Membership</p> 
<p>We are delighted to welcome three new members this week and one truly 
demented renewal. We're happy to have even the demented ones, you know.</p> 
<p>How nice to welcome Jose from Durango who brings us Tequila's Mexican 
Restaurant soon to open in a newly renovated location at 439 San Juan St. 
(formerly the Riverside Restaurant.) Tequila's also enjoys a Durango location, 
and is known far and wide for its authentic Mexican food. The restaurant will 
be open Monday through Thursday 11 a.m.-10 p.m., Friday and Saturday 11-11, and 
Sundays from 11-10. After opening, you will be able to call them at 264-9989. 
We are grateful to member Todd Shelton for recruiting these fine folks and will 
see to it that there is a little something extra in his stocking at Christmas.
</p> 
<p>Our old friends Henry and Sheila Ford join us next with Colorado Provision 
Company located at 482 Swiss Village Drive. Henry, Sheila and I graduated from 
the same high school in Fort Lauderdale and there just aren't too many people 
in Pagosa who graduated from Stranahan. The Colorado Provision Company offers 
crafts, delicious packaged gourmet foods and music. We're happy to welcome them 
and invite you to give them a call at 264-9038 for more information about 
Colorado Provision Company.</p> 
<p>Our third new member this week is Cindy Plate who brings us Galles Fine 
Properties located at 468 Lewis St. Galles Fine Properties specializes in 
marketing distinctive sporting properties and estates around the world. Cindy 
invites you to give her a call at 264-6551 to learn more about how she can help 
you with acquiring distinctive properties.</p> 
<p>Our demented renewal this week is none other than the Sir Laurence Olivier 
of Pagosa Springs, Lee Sterling. He was recruited by the Trowbridge's treasured 
Labrador Retriever, Winston, and I won't even begin to touch his description of 
services. Our sympathy, as always, goes out to Lee's wonderful wife, Patty. (As 
you all know very well, this is all in jest - truth be known, we love Lee more 
than life itself.)</p>

<p>&quot;Internet Blue Pages: the Guide to Federal Government Web Sites,&quot;

own comprehensive list of government Web sites. And there are very few 
government search engines that will search all sites for occurrences of terms. 
The government is printing less and less important information for our

without access to important documents.</p>

<p>Nancy McInerney ordered a number of xeriscape books to help us during this 
drought. &quot;The Xeriscape Color Guide,&quot; by David Winger of the Denver 
Water Department, tells of 100 waterwise plants for landscaping. It is easy to 
read, with vividly illustrated charts showing the colors of flowers, fruit, 
bark and foliage during each season for the years. In addition, information is 
given concerning the plant's structure, its land use, as well as light and 
water requirements.</p> 
<p>&quot;Dry-Land Gardening: a Xeriscaping Guide for Dry-Summer, Cold-Winter 
Climates,&quot; by Jennifer Bennett, deals with invasive plants and trees under 
stress among other subjects.</p> 
<p>&quot;The Xeriscape Handbook: a How-To Guide to Natural Resource-wise 
Gardening,&quot; by Gayle Weinstein, offers a practical approach to maintaining 
a landscape in tune with the environment. Weinstein is a naturalist for the 
city and county of Denver. She also teaches at the University of Colorado at 
Denver. She is the cofounder of the Xeriscape Clinics at the Denver Water 
Department.</p> 
<p>Who runs the country?</p> 
<p>Someone brought us this explanation, author unknown: &quot;The Wall Street 
Journal is read by people who run the country. The New York Times is read by 
people who think they run the country. The Washington Post is read by people 
who think they should run the country. USA Today is ready by people who think 
they ought to run the country but don't really understand the Washington Post. 
They do, however, like their smog statistics shown in pie charts. The Los 
Angeles Times is read by people who wouldn't mind running the country if they 
could spare the time and didn't have to leave L.A. to do it. The Boston Globe 
is read by people whose parents used to run the country and think they did a 
far superior job of it. The San Francisco Chronicle is read by people who 
aren't sure there is a country or that anyone is running it, but in any case 
they oppose all that they stand for unless they are handicapped or Democrats. 
The Miami Herald is read by people who are running another country but need the 
baseball scores.&quot;</p>
