<p><b>Devil Mountain Fire ruled</b></p> 
<p><b>controlled; cause probed </b></p> 
<p><b>By Tess Noel Baker</b></p> 
<p><b>Staff Writer</b></p> 
<p>The 60-acre Devil Mountain Fire burning about two miles northeast of 
Chimney Rock is completely contained.</p> 
<p>Laurie Robison, fire information officer for San Juan Public Lands, said 
100 percent containment was achieved by Wednesday morning after three days of 
firefighting.</p> 
<p>&quot;We expect to call it controlled later today,&quot; she said at about 
8:30 a.m. Wednesday. Cause of the fire is still under investigtion.</p> 
<p>The fire started one mile north of U.S. 160 near Devil Mountain Road about 
4 p.m. Sunday and burned in ponderosa, pine and oak. Isolated trees were 
torched.</p> 
<p>Six engines, two water tenders and two helicopters along with fixed-wing 
aircraft and firefighters from the San Juan National Forest, Southern Ute 
Agency, the Pagosa Fire Protection District and Upper the Pine River Fire 
District responded.</p> 
<p>Pagosa Fire Chief Warren Grams said two trucks and four people from his 
district responded to the fire Sunday night for structure protection duties. 
Two tankers and two people from Pagosa remained on the fire Monday and Tuesday 
to assist with water supply.</p> 
<p>Devil Mountain Incident Commander Steve Hentschell said Monday crews worked 
to keep the fire east of Devil Mountain Road and west of Little Devil Creek. 
The forest service road was temporarily closed to the public, but U.S. 160 was 
not impacted, although huge clouds of smoke had drivers alert to nearby danger.
</p> 
<p>Firefighters completed a fireline around the perimeter of the blaze Monday. 
However, some spotting of embers across the line continued through Tuesday when 
three 20-person crews, two helicopters, three engines and two water tenders 
continued to work on mop up and attacking any additional hot spots.</p> 
<p>While crews worked the Devil Mountain Fire, lightning started several more 
small blazes throughout the Durango Interagency Dispatch Center, including nine 
Monday afternoon. All of those remained under a quarter of an acre.</p> 
<p>It was the first major forest fire in the county this year. Others nearby 
have been in Mineral and Hinsdale counties. One in southeastern Archuleta was 
allowed to burn out.<b> </b></p>

<p><b>Pagosa Lakes seeks air pollution gauges, road dusts targeted</b></p> 
<p><b>By Richard Walter</b></p> 
<p><b>Staff Writer</b></p> 
<p>It is an issue that just won't go away, no matter how much discussion, how 
much action or how much verbal retribution.</p> 
<p>Roads and the maintenance or lack thereof, keep coming back to the Pagosa 
Lakes Property Owners Association board of directors.</p> 
<p>And regularly, board members point out they have no jurisdiction over the 
traffic conduits, that they are in fact county responsibility.</p> 
<p>All that background came bouncing over the potholes to the board again July 
8 - in several different forms.</p> 
<p>The newest of those elements, introduced by Michael Piper, chairman of the 
association's Lakes, Fisheries and Parks Committee, won board endorsement 
pending specific wording decisions.</p> 
<p>It calls for the state's Environmental Protection Agency to install air 
pollution monitoring devices in the Pagosa Lakes communities to determine the 
levels of dust pollution and whether the county is meeting health standards for 
air quality.</p> 
<p>Besides the perceived health issue, Piper told the board, &quot;we might be 
able to use the empirical data collected to pressure the county for improved 
road controls.&quot;</p> 
<p>&quot;We could submit photos and testimony from individuals in conjunction 
with monitoring reports, to back up the need for road improvements,&quot; he 
added.</p> 
<p>He and members of the board cited the experience of the Town of Pagosa 
Springs which had to meet an EPA mandate to pave roads in order to reduce air 
pollution which was considered a health threat.</p> 
<p>Piper said the town still must meet those conditions imposed by EPA and 
&quot;there is no reason to believe the county should not have to meet the same 
conditions in heavily populated areas.&quot;</p> 
<p>Piper said he began researching the idea last year and has consulted health 
officials and environmental officials at regional and state levels and 
&quot;all showed an inclination to want as much data as we are able to 
supply.&quot;</p> 
<p>An individual cannot start the process, he said, it has to be a 
governmental agency or a major representative of the community at large.</p> 
<p>&quot;This board, as representative of the second largest property owners 
association in the nation, certainly fills that role,&quot; he said.</p> 
<p>After members read the proposed statement to EPA, they agreed the idea is a 
good one and voted unanimously for Piper and Walt Lukasik, general manager, to 
work out the wording and directed Lukasik to sign on behalf of the board.</p> 
<p>Specifically excluded from the draft proposal, by the board action, was any 
reference to cost-sharing, without specifics not yet known.</p> 
<p>Piper told the board he is convinced from his research and conversations 
&quot;that the state will fund such a project without fiscal restraints. The 
San Juan Basin Health Department's environmental division strongly advocates 
such action,&quot; Piper told the board.</p> 
<p>Director Fred Ebeling told his compatriots, &quot;I think it's very 
worthwhile and we should pursue it.&quot;</p> 
<p>Asked what cost figures might be involved, Piper said he's been told each 
filter test would run about $15.</p> 
<p>From the audience, Mojie Adler said, &quot;I'll kick in for 100 tests at 
that price. I've personally complained to EPA and have exchanged letters 
several times. But I never got any action.&quot;</p> 
<p>Piper said La Plata County has been doing similar testing for years and 
each time a new proposal is made there is resistance.</p> 
<p>Ebeling said, &quot;Many of our roads are just as bad today as the town's 
were when the EPA forced it to take action. We should be able to produce 
evidence that we deserve the same type of action.&quot;</p> 
<p>In answer to another board question, Piper said his impression is that it 
would take at least a year for such testing to establish a statistical base for 
potential action by the EPA against the county.</p> 
<p>&quot;We don't want the road thing to go on forever,&quot; Piper said. </p> 
<p>On a unanimous vote, the board (with two members absent) approved the idea.
</p> 
<p>But that wasn't the only road issue to arise during the meeting and 
Sweetwater Drive, along with Twin Creek Circle, was the prime target, again.</p>
<p>Property owner Jerry Baier told the board he drives both roads daily and 
that &quot;they are a disgrace.&quot;</p> 
<p>Seemingly unaware of the previous complaints to the board and by the board 
to the county, Baier lambasted directors for not living up to their 
responsibility.</p> 
<p>&quot;You were elected to represent the members of this community, to solve 
its problems. You should be able to do more to get action from a county which 
doesn't seem to care about long-range problems.&quot;</p> 
<p>He was referred to a SUN page one article published that day detailing 
plans the county is developing to put a mill levy increase specifically for 
road upgrade and maintenance on the fall ballot.</p> 
<p>Director Gerry Smith took on his attack with a brief outline of all the 
attempts by the association in the last four years to &quot;interface with the 
county. We've tried to get every road categorized and designated for specific 
type of maintenance.&quot;</p> 
<p>Baier was not appeased.</p> 
<p>&quot;You have a special obligation because your represent the greater part 
of greater Pagosa Springs and the greatest percentage of voters in the county. 
On their part, you need to be more aggressive.&quot;</p> 
<p>Director David Bohl, board president trying mollify the resident, pointed 
out there is insufficient tax base in the county for maintenance of all roads. 
&quot;Take a ride on some of the other county roads - Fourmile, Snowball, 
Trujillo, and you'll find similar problems.&quot;</p> 
<p>&quot;A metro district is potentially the answer,&quot; Bohl said, 
&quot;but it is not something we as a board can do. We are prohibited from such 
action by state law. Yet we are confronted regularly by people who insist we 
should do something we are not allowed to do. People need to know that if they 
want something they have to follow the rules and work for it. Too many who come 
here don't want to back up their complaint with effort.&quot;</p> 
<p>Maier, still adamant, argued, &quot;the county has failed to maintain roads 
at any reasonable level. We have the votes here to force action and we should 
use them.&quot;</p> 
<p>Adler suggested the Pagoa Lakes community &quot;pays 67 percent of the 
taxes collected in the county and thus should get 67 percent of the services 
financed by those taxes.&quot;</p> 
<p>That moved Bohl to halt the discussion.</p>

<p><b>Friendly elk proves axiom:</b></p> 
<p><b>Don't mess with nature</b></p> 
<p><b>By Tom Carosello</b></p> 
<p><b>Staff Writer</b></p> 
<p>Due to the abundance of wildlife in Pagosa Country, interaction with 
members of local elk and deer herds is sometimes unavoidable.</p> 
<p>However, area residents are reminded to consider one simple notion when 
faced with a potential wildlife encounter: No matter how tempting, it's usually 
best not to mess with Mother Nature.</p> 
<p>It's a suggestion that is especially relevant in light of recent events 
involving the Colorado Division of Wildlife's relocation of a 2-year-old female 
elk from the Upper Blanco area to Fort Collins.</p> 
<p>Although the animal's story does not end on a sad note, per se, the elk's 
fate is nevertheless not what nature intended.</p> 
<p>&quot;It was a calf that someone in the neighborhood thought had been 
abandoned by its mother and was then bottle-fed,&quot; explained Doug Purcell, 
DOW district wildlife manager for the Pagosa area.</p> 
<p>The supposed spring orphan soon became accustomed to human company, said 
Purcell, and spent the proceeding summer and fall sampling feed intended for 
livestock while other elk in the area eventually moved on to traditional winter 
feeding grounds.</p> 
<p>&quot;It basically stayed in the area because it was constantly being fed 
and had plenty of food available,&quot; said Purcell.</p> 
<p>When the local herd returned the following spring, the yearling was 
strongly encouraged to rejoin the group, but was apparently looked upon as an 
outcast whenever it attempted to mingle with its own kind.</p> 
<p>The same pattern held true through this spring as well, said Purcell, and 
the young elk grew &quot;less wild&quot; with the passing of each week as it 
continued to lose its inherent fear of humans.</p> 
<p>&quot;She was pretty confused,&quot; said Purcell. &quot;She would go 
around elk and get beat up, then go around people and get petted and get 
treats. So she decided to hang out with people.&quot;</p> 
<p>The elk became especially fond of men and boys, said Purcell, but took to 
disliking the fairer sex - rearing up and chasing various local females, 
including a 3-year-old girl, on numerous occasions.</p> 
<p>With the elk now posing a threat to human safety, &quot;We decided we 
didn't want this situation to go any further and tried to get people to scare 
the animal off,&quot; said Purcell.</p> 
<p>Despite the efforts, the animal returned again and again to receive 
handouts from people who, when asked by Purcell why they continued the 
practice, responded with, &quot;I just can't help it.&quot;</p> 
<p>The situation now left the DOW with only two options for the animal: 
destruction or relocation.</p> 
<p>&quot;And we chose to relocate the animal,&quot; said Purcell, indicating 
the elk was relocated last week to join a captive herd at a research center in 
Fort Collins consisting of various paddocks within an area of several hundred 
acres.</p> 
<p>How &quot;tame&quot; was the animal when Purcell got the call to travel to 
the neighborhood with a horse trailer and load her?</p> 
<p>&quot;It wasn't difficult; I just walked her in,&quot; he explained.</p> 
<p>Feeding and nourishment studies are the main undertakings of the Fort 
Collins facility, said Purcell, noting the animal will not be subjected to 
experiments involving the study of Chronic Wasting Disease.</p> 
<p>According to Purcell, the nourishment studies help the DOW determine the 
best formula for feeding the state's wild elk herds in times when severe winter 
conditions make natural food sources scarce.</p> 
<p>&quot;The treatment of the animal was a concern of many residents,&quot; 
said Purcell. &quot;But the truth is, most of the elk at this facility end up 
dying of old age.</p> 
<p>&quot;It's the best situation in this case,&quot; he added. &quot;She's not 
free-roaming as she ought to be, but she could have ended up worse off.&quot;
</p> 
<p>As for the lesson to be learned, &quot;We advise people to leave wildlife 
babies alone,&quot; concluded Purcell. </p> 
<p>&quot;Often the mother is not far off and will return to care for its young 
if given enough time.&quot;</p>

<p><b>Safety warning for pass project </b></p> 
<p><b>By Tess Noel Baker</b></p> 
<p><b>Staff Writer</b></p> 
<p>Asphalt-paving on U.S. 160 near Treasure Falls will begin the week of July 
21. Motorists should expect to experience 20-minute delays.</p> 
<p>Employees at Nielson's Skanska, the contractors on the project, ask that 
anyone traveling through the project follow the directions of traffic control 
personnel and posted speed limits at all times. This is for the safety of the 
public as well as those working on the project.</p> 
<p>The public should also realize that a worker's line of sight can be 
obstructed when operating large pieces of construction equipment. It is not 
always easy to see what is going on around them. Also, during the paving 
portion of the project, additional construction workers will be walking the 
project, doing their job. Anyone not in the proper lane could be a hazard.</p> 
<p>The Treasure Falls project extends from mile marker 158.5 to mile marker 
163.9.</p> 
<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p> 
<p><b>Overnight closures back on Wolf Creek </b></p> 
<p>Overnight closures have returned to Wolf Creek Pass.</p> 
<p>Until the end of the year, construction crews will be working along U.S. 
160 between mile markers 179 and 182 on the east side of the pass west of South 
Fork.</p> 
<p>Through the rest of this month, overnight closures will be in effect 10 
p.m.-5 a.m. Mondays through Thursdays July 19-22 and July 26-29.</p> 
<p>During these closures, overnight traffic traveling to the east side of Wolf 
Creek Pass should choose as an alternate route U.S. 84 south to Chama, N.M., 
then north on Route 17 to U.S. 285. Westbound traffic can follow the same route 
in reverse.</p> 
<p>Weekday traffic stops also are still in effect and motorists should expect 
delays to exceed 30 minutes while construction crews work in the area.</p> 
<p>There are currently no weekend traffic impacts.</p> 
<p>The project includes highway widening and construction of uphill and 
downhill retaining walls. It began Feb. 17 and is scheduled for completion in 
late 2004.</p>

<p><b>Eyesore charge spurs discussion of how PLPOA dues are spent </b></p> 
<p><b>By Richard Walter</b></p> 
<p><b>Staff Writer</b></p> 
<p>&quot;Where does the money go that we pay into Pagosa Lakes Property Owners 
Association on a yearly basis?&quot; a member of the audience asked association 
directors July 8.</p> 
<p>Dr. Ray Adams, who initially was demanding action to correct &quot;a 
residential eyesore&quot; near his new home and within site of association 
offices, was the questioner.</p> 
<p>His question came after the board indicated it has initiated one action 
against the property owner in question but that other complaints about 
materials in the yard do not fall within subdivision regulations.</p> 
<p>Adams' complaint was supported by residents Gary Waples and Mojie Adler.</p>
<p>Waples told the board, &quot;You all have beautiful homes. If that mess was 
next to me, I'd be appalled. If I tried to change the color of my home without 
a permit I'd be targeted, but this disgraceful mess is allowed to exist.&quot;
</p> 
<p>Adler said she supports Adams' statements. &quot;It has bugged me for a 
long time. That yard is an eyesore and it puts a negative image on PLPOA 
offices just a block away.&quot;</p> 
<p>That brought the money question from Adams.</p> 
<p>He was told the budget is always available for inspection and on a visit to 
the office he can get a line-by-line breakdown.</p> 
<p>Adler, however, argued, &quot;I have a copy of the budget and we're not 
getting what we're paying for. We commit $5,000 annually to the health district 
and pay for a lot of other silly stuff. That money could be more beneficially 
spent in other areas.&quot;</p> 
<p>Adams wondered what happened to the money formerly spent on the Pagosa 
Lakes Public Service Office.</p> 
<p>Director David Bohl, board president, made note of the fact the association 
&quot;went from deficit to a fully-funded reserve&quot; in the wake of PSO 
dissolution.</p> 
<p>Director Gerry Smith went to a statistical review to disclose exact amounts 
budgeted from $1.16 million in dues received: $189,600 covers operation 
expenses; $345,000 plus to property and environment management; $316,000 plus 
to payroll being the largest figures.</p> 
<p>&quot;Take a look at the data available to you,&quot; he said. &quot;You'll 
get a dollar by dollar line on your dues uses.&quot;</p> 
<p>Bohl noted, &quot;We have been consistently below budgeted amount on our 
actual expenses.&quot;</p> 
<p>Adler said the $189,000 for covenant compliance is a lot when &quot;it is 
not being done right in view of the office across the parking lot outside.&quot;
</p> 
<p>Bohl disagreed. &quot;Every month we have reports filed for review on 
actions taken and fines levied,&quot; he said.</p> 
<p>And Walt Lukasik, general manager, pointed out the four member commission 
processed 101 applications and issued 111 permits in June alone. They also 
issued 56 first notices of violation, 35 second notices and issued four formal 
notices of violation, closed 46 cases and has 138 issues pending.</p>

<p><b>Staff Writer</b></p> 
<p>Some new folks will be walking Pagosa streets this summer.</p> 
<p>Market researchers.</p> 
<p>The Mayor's Council for the Future of Pagosa Springs and the Town of Pagosa 
Springs have commissioned a market research study to focus on the behavior and 
attitudes of visitors to the area.</p> 
<p>The goal is to gain understanding of the market segments that comprise the 
visitor base. Specific issues covered in the surveys include: demographics, 
geographic origin, vacation patterns, reasons for coming to Pagosa Springs and 
a comparison of Pagosa with other destinations.</p> 
<p>Research will go on throughout the summer at various locations in Pagosa 
Springs and will utilize a scientific random sampling methodology to ensure 
reliable results. As part of the process, trained interviewers will be 
contacting visitors in key locations around town, including: the River Center, 
Downtown, the Visitor Center, Hot Springs Boulevard and Pagosa Country Center. 
Surveys take between three and five minutes to complete.</p> 
<p>Information gleaned from the study will be make available to the community 
upon completion and will help in shaping ongoing master planning and marketing 
efforts.</p>

<p><b>New federal plan could aid local ambulance operations </b></p> 
<p><b>By Tess Noel Baker</b></p> 
<p><b>Staff Writer</b></p> 
<p>Adoption of a temporary regional ambulance fee schedule as part of the 
Medicare modernization act may allow the Upper San Juan Health Service District 
to receive more reimbursement on certain ambulance call fees.</p> 
<p>According to a release from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, 
the new law, or interim final rule, will increase Medicare payments to 
ambulance services by $840 million between July 2004 and Dec. 31, 2009, the 
length of the interim rule. This is an attempt to offer additional funding to 
ambulance services as they transition to a national fee schedule that took 
effect April 1, 2002.</p> 
<p>Allen Hughes, interim business manager for the district, said it currently 
receives about $187 in reimbursement from Medicare for a basic life support 
trip to Durango that is billed at about $600.</p> 
<p>Any additional reimbursement would be &quot;exciting stuff,&quot; Hughes 
said. &quot;It would help us recover some of the operating costs we're now 
getting hit hard on.&quot;</p> 
<p>Under the new rule, rural ambulance services will receive a 2-percent 
increase in payments for Medicare clients for services furnished between July 
1, 2004 and Dec. 31, 2006. In addition, for services rendered between July 1, 
2004 and Dec. 31, 2008, both urban and rural ambulances will receive a 
25-percent increase in their milage rates for all miles greater than the 50th 
mile while carrying a beneficiary.</p> 
<p>Besides that, the rule implements a &quot;super-rural bonus,&quot; that 
expressly benefits the most rural areas for services furnished between July 1, 
2004 and Dec. 31, 2009. This bonus will increase the base rate by 22.6 percent 
where the ambulance transport originates in a rural area determined by the 
secretary to be in the lowest 25th percentile of all rural populations arrayed 
by population density.</p> 
<p>&quot;This new rule improves payments for all ground ambulance services, 
and it's especially important for ensuring the continued viability of ambulance 
services in rural areas as they make the transition to the national fee 
schedule,&quot; said CMS Administrator Mark McClellen.</p> 
<p>Hughes said it is possible Pagosa could qualify under the &quot;super-rural 
bonus.&quot;</p> 
<p>&quot;We're very low density, very rural,&quot; he said. &quot;There are 
some places in the county that in my mind should be considered frontier.&quot;
</p> 
<p>The problem, he said, is getting any reimbursement at all.</p> 
<p>The district received a notice June 30 from Centers for Medicare and 
Medicaid Services requesting the return of $2,909.06 in overpayments for 
transports made to physician's offices in 2002. According to a letter from CMS, 
Medicare does not cover transport to a physician's office, only to a hospital, 
critical access hospital, skilled nursing facility or dialysis facility.</p> 
<p>Currently, Hughes said, none of the local health care facilities, including 
the Dr. Mary Fisher Medical Center, qualify. The medical center is licensed as 
an Emergency Care Center by the state, but that qualification is not recognized 
federally. Hughes is researching options for qualifying the Mary Fisher Medical 
Center under Medicare's options. Until then, he said, service will continue for 
all patients. Bills for patients covered by Medicare or Medicaid that terminate 
at the Dr. Mary Fisher Medical Center will be held until a solution is reached.
</p> 
<p>Hughes said transports that end at Mercy Medical Center in Durango or 
another hospital facility are not a problem and can be billed as normal.</p>

<p><b>PLPOA owner survey tabled pending result of workshop session</b></p> 
<p><b>By Richard Walter</b></p> 
<p><b>Staff Writer</b></p> 
<p>A proposal to embark on a major survey of what residents in Pagosa Lakes 
subdivisions want the area to be like 15-20 years down the road is on temporary 
hold.</p> 
<p>Proposed in June by Director Gerry Smith, the idea was tabled July 8 for a 
full-board work session sometime prior to the annual meeting July 31.</p> 
<p>Smith, who was prepared to offer six motions backing his plan, distributed 
copies of them to board members in attendance and after a brief time for them 
to be read, made the first motion, to review all covenants and declarations for 
determination of what can and cannot be enforced and what should be amended.</p>
<p>That brought opposition from Director Fred Ebeling who said insufficient 
time was given for considering the motions and determining for one's self the 
merits.</p> 
<p>Director Hugh Bundy who had initially seconded the motion, moved to 
withdraw his action.</p> 
<p>Ebeling then moved for the work session and with Smith's assent the board 
agreed unanimously. The other motions proposed were never read for the public.
</p> 
<p>Director David Bohl, board president, said many residents have suggested 
&quot;it is time for our Declarations to be rewritten, that some are no longer 
compatible, and that some actually violate federal law.&quot;</p> 
<p>&quot;We need to consider legality and fairness in any future studies, no 
matter how they are conducted.&quot;</p> 
<p>Ebeling suggested the results of a telephone survey two years ago should 
help formulate questions for now, or, &quot;even negate the need for another 
full survey.&quot;</p> 
<p>When Smith suggested his plan would have people from each subdivision on 
the committee, Ebeling argued the proposal might mean 3-7 from each subdivision 
and there about 27 subdivisions. &quot;That means a committee of 75-200, and 
that won't work.&quot;</p> 
<p>Smith denied it would be that big, but agreed to the workshop. </p> 
<p>Walt Lukasik, general manager, reported to the board that a portion of the 
Lake Pagosa dam spillway had collapsed and was being repaired.</p> 
<p>Larry Lynch, the PLPOA property and environment manager, explained the 
first evidence of the damage was a sinkhole developing.</p> 
<p>He said the problem was repaired by Kinder Morgan. A gas firm contractor 
apparently clipped an overflow culvert about two years ago and the damage was 
not seen.</p> 
<p>When the sink hole developed it was reported and the repair work ordered.
</p> 
<p>In other action, the board:</p> 
<p>- learned the bids for the North Pagosa Trail project came in about $5,000 
over budget of $40,000 and the county has been asked to release funds from the 
trail escrow account to meet the overrun;</p> 
<p>- were told the 18,150 newsletters mailed out with ballots for the annual 
election have resulted in about 2,500 returns so far, about two thirds from 
time shares;</p> 
<p>- was informed CenturyTel is embarking on a 5-year area update and will 
start in Twin Creek Village with trenching and will notify residents when and 
where that work will be in progress;</p> 
<p>- heard that in addition to the bear pictured on the front page of The SUN 
that day, formal reports of bears have been received from Vista, Martinez II, 
Twin Creek Village and one other area;</p> 
<p>- were told Deacon Tom Bomkamp of Immaculate Heart of Mary Church has been 
invited to deliver the invocation at the annual meeting;</p> 
<p>- approved Lukasik's request to secure a retail sales license for the 
Association for use at the recreation center.</p>

<p>Action to change the meeting came at a 6 a.m. executive session held June 
29 on what was called &quot;a confidential matter.&quot;</p> 
<p>Though records indicate a notice of the executive session was sent to The 
SUN, it was not seen.</p>

<p><b>Fire district audit excellent; 20-year plan urged </b></p> 
<p><b>By Tess Noel Baker</b></p> 
<p><b>Staff Writer</b></p> 
<p>The Pagosa Fire Protection District received a clean bill of health from 
its auditor Tuesday.</p> 
<p>&quot;You have a great staff and you're a great board to work with,&quot; 
auditor Frankie White, CPA said, going over two letters she prepared for the 
district.</p> 
<p>&quot;We noted no matters involving the internal control and its operation 
that we consider to be a reportable condition under standards established by 
the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants,&quot; she said.</p> 
<p>According to the 2003 audit, as of Dec. 31 the district had total revenues 
of $1,253,682 compared to $911,847 in 2002. Total expenditures for last year 
were $978,412 compared to $737,314 in 2002. The pension trust fund grew from 
$2,112,479 to $2,365,147 over the year.</p> 
<p>Later in the meeting, Director Dusty Pierce said the board should be 
looking ahead to the 2005 budget and the idea of establishing a reserve fund 
for truck replacement.</p> 
<p>At one time, he said, the district's goal was to have no vehicles more than 
30 years old in service. Now, with support from the voters in 2002, that's 
happened. It's time to start thinking of the future when perhaps the rule is, 
&quot;no trucks more than 20 years old.&quot;</p> 
<p>&quot;I just wanted to plant the seed tonight,&quot; Pierce said. He 
suggested possibly keeping three months of operating expenses in the current 
reserve fund and placing anything in excess of that in a fund for truck 
replacement so that the district would have to ask the voters to pass a bond 
issue when trucks get old again.</p> 
<p>The board agreed it was a good idea.</p> 
<p>&quot;We'll just have to decide how much on an annual basis to put in 
it,&quot; Board Chairman Dick Moseley said.</p> 
<p>Meanwhile, Fire Chief Warren Grams said he would continue to research the 
best use for a final piece or two of old equipment replaced when the district 
purchased six new vehicles in 2003.</p> 
<p>The old equipment has been for sale for 14 months. Several pieces have been 
sold, Grams said, including a tanker last month for $27,600. The remaining 
pieces need to move, he said, or will begin to fail from nonuse and exposure to 
the elements.</p> 
<p>&quot;I would almost suggest to the board if there were some fire 
department in the state who could really use this equipment, maybe we give it 
to them,&quot; Grams said.</p> 
<p>&quot;What about further expansion of the district?&quot; Director Ronnie 
Maez asked.</p> 
<p>Grams said some interest had been expressed in a small expansion in the 
Hidden Valley area where some of the equipment might be used, but nothing was 
definite.</p> 
<p>&quot;We can sit on them for two more months and see what happens,&quot; he 
said.</p> 
<p>The board directed Grams to check on both the expansion and possible 
donation of the trucks.</p> 
<p>&quot;Before winter they need to be inside,&quot; Moseley said.</p>

<p><b>New state funding made available for grasslands reserve program </b></p> 
<p>Allen Green, state conservationist of the Natural Resources Conservation 
Service (NRCS), and Lewis Frank, state executive director of the Farm Service 
Agency (FSA), have announced the availability of $1.45 million for the 
Grassland Reserve Program (GRP) in Colorado.</p> 
<p>The GRP is designed to help landowners protect grasslands from conversion 
to other uses and to support continued stewardship on viable, working ranch 
lands. Applications received through July 23 will be considered for the limited 
2004 funding.</p> 
<p>&quot;Land eligibility is fairly straightforward,&quot; says Dennis 
Alexander, assistant state conservationist for programs. &quot;Land to be 
enrolled in the program must be grassland, contain forbs or shrubland, or be 
land that historically has been dominated by grassland, forbs, or shrubs.&quot;
</p> 
<p>Production crops (other than hay), fruit trees, vineyards, or any activity 
that requires breaking the soil surface, except for appropriate land 
management, are not eligible and are prohibited.</p> 
<p>&quot;The program is designed to protect our very vulnerable and fragile 
grasslands and their native species,&quot; Alexander goes on to say. 
&quot;Given our limited funding, we anticipate that competition for enrollment 
will be intense.&quot;</p> 
<p>Landowners have several enrollment options including easements and 
agreements. One can enroll in a permanent or 30-year easement or choose to 
enroll in a 10, 15, 20, or 30-year agreement.</p> 
<p>Two separate funding pools will be used for easements and for agreements. 
Each pool will receive 50 percent of the total GRP allocation. Landowners 
should consult their local conservation district, NRCS, or FSA office for 
further details regarding the differences between easement and agreement 
payments.</p> 
<p>&quot;Funds will be targeted to native, natural grasslands that support 
certain plant communities and habitat types. Offers most likely to be funded 
will be part of a sustainable, working ranch unit and consist entirely of 
natural and native grassland that are in good condition and that have never 
been plowed or cropped.&quot; Alexander further states.</p> 
<p>Other priorities for funding will be the existence of adequate fencing and 
watering facilities as well as evidence of sustainable grazing management.</p> 
<p>Four plant communities will be targeted in 2004 including Shortgrass 
Prairie, Sand Sage, Sagebrush Steppe, and Sagebrush/Wet Meadow Complex.</p> 
<p>Alexander concluded, &quot;We have designed this program to be as 
responsive to the needs of Colorado's land users as possible by permitting 
grazing that maintains viability of the grassland, as well as haying, mowing, 
and harvesting for seed production which is subject to certain restrictions 
during the nesting season.&quot;</p> 
<p>In Colorado, GRP will target lands that are under some threat of conversion 
to rural residential development, as well as land that is threatened to be 
converted to cropland or other agricultural uses.</p> 
<p>To apply for this program and for additional information regarding it, 
landowners are encouraged to contact their local conservation district office 
or the local NRCS or FSA office that services their county. These are located 
in USDA Service Centers across the state.</p>

<p><b>Road work zone safety campaign is launched </b></p> 
<p>Colorado Department of Transportation is working in partnership this summer 
with Colorado State Patrol on a public awareness program targeting unsafe 
driving in work zones.</p> 
<p>The Transportation Department has adopted a new campaign entitled 
&quot;Slow for the Cone Zone&quot; in an effort to improve unsafe driving 
practices and reduce accidents and fatalities in highway construction zones.</p>
<p>In 2002 (the most recent statistics available), 133,700 accidents occurred 
in Colorado construction zones resulting in 1,238 injuries and 20 deaths. The 
number of injuries and deaths caused by work zone accidents has doubled in the 
past year, officials said.</p> 
<p>Nationally, over 53,000 people were injured and 1,181 killed in work zone 
crashes in 2002. Statistics indicate there are one work zone fatality every 
seven hours and one work zone injury every 15 minutes on the nation's roadways.
</p> 
<p>Through the end of summer, the Department will be running a combination of 
outdoor advertising and radio traffic announcements with the media mix expected 
to reach motorists in their vehicles to create immediate awareness of 
&quot;Slow for the Cone Zone.&quot;</p> 
<p>Project cost is just over $250,000.</p> 
<p>Safety enforcement activity will be increased through the following highway 
projects in the Pagosa Springs area:</p> 
<p>- U.S. 160 Wolf Creek Tunnel, east of pass summit;</p> 
<p>- U.S. 160 West Side Wolf Creek resurfacing from Treasure Falls to east 
side of summit.</p> 
<p>&quot;Our partnership on this campaign is intended to help focus attention 
on the many lives lost on our highways each year,&quot; said Stacey Stegman, 
CDOT public relations director. &quot;Just last month two CDOT highway workers 
were killed as a result of someone carelessly crashing through a work zone. We 
hope this campaign will serve as a constant reminder to motorists that when 
driving in a cone zone, you must focus on the roadway, slow down and drive with 
care.&quot;</p>

<p><b>Summit Academy expanding focus in new school year </b></p> 
<p>Summit Christian Academy of Pagosa Springs is expanding focus and outlook 
for the 2004-2005 school year.</p> 
<p>A K-12 school which began operation in 1997, Summit has primarily focused 
on teaching those with learning style differences with the motto 
&quot;Assisting Smart, but Struggling Students.&quot;</p> 
<p>The school has a small student-teacher ratio and utilizes visual, auditory 
and kinesthetic teaching methods in an interactive, hands-on creative classroom 
setting. Students receive individualized attention in an encouraging and 
nurturing environment which focuses on unique learning styles and gifts.</p> 
<p>With provable success in that area, it was recently determined by the 
school board that Summit should begin offering classes for more traditional and 
gifted students as well.</p> 
<p>The school belies it has a program that can help all students regardless of 
need or scholastic achievement.</p> 
<p>Summit will continue focusing on the academic, emotional, spiritual and 
physical development of each student using the best techniques available.</p> 
<p>The school philosophy is best summed up in the Cynthia Tobias statement, 
&quot;If children don't learn the way we teach, we must teach the way they 
learn.&quot;</p> 
<p>Traditional junior and high school classes are offered on the block system 
and several electives such as art, drama, Spanish I, keyboarding and wood shop 
with moral character and high standards woven into the curriculum.</p>

<p><b>'La Reyna Madre' title given</b></p> 
<p><b>Fiesta's Beatrice Espinosa </b></p> 
<p>The Pagosa Springs Spanish Fiesta Club has issued a new title for a member 
of its Royal Court.</p> 
<p>Beatrice Mary Espinosa will be the 2004 Spanish Fiesta &quot;La Reyna 
Madre.&quot; This honorary position is awarded Bea in recognition of her 
efforts to promote and continue the Hispanic traditions of the community.</p> 
<p>Bea was born in Chama, N.M. to Fidel and Amalia Herrera. She had five 
brothers and five sisters. As with most who lived in this area, her struggles 
were many but perseverance and hark work kept her spirit strong.</p> 
<p>She married George Espinosa in 1949 and they moved to the family ranch on 
Cat Creek Road in Archuleta County in 1951. There they raised five sons and 
three daughters. She was housewife to the large family and the rancher 
housewife had to be an especially strong woman. Raising cattle and sheep on the 
ranch was not easy.</p> 
<p>After 27 years of marriage George's death left Bea and her children with 
more than they could handle. With what seemed the worst of circumstances, Bea 
maintained a spirit that could not be broken. She raised the children with lots 
of love and a strong sense of heritage.</p> 
<p>Song and dance softened the hardships and struggles she went through and 
she has always loved to dance. She has been teaching her grandchildren 
Folklorico dancing and helps them with their costumes.</p> 
<p>Her cooking has brought the family together with friends on many occasions 
and for many celebrations.</p> 
<p>Bea continues to enrich the lives of so many through her experience, good 
food, song, and dance.</p> 
<p>Now, when asked how many grandkids she has, she will tell you, &quot;38, 
but everybody calls me grandma.&quot;</p> 
<p>Be sure to congratulate Be when you see her at Fiesta.</p>

<p><b>James Martin named fair's Super Volunteer </b></p> 
<p>The Archuleta County Fair Board is establishing a &quot;Super Volunteer 
Award&quot; this year.</p> 
<p>The fair could not exist, now or ever, without the many hours many people 
devote to planning, executing, organizing and providing physical labor to the 
efforts that make the fair what it is.</p> 
<p>While we have so many people to thank and recognize, this award is our way 
to salute one person annually for their over-the-top efforts on behalf of the 
Fair Board.</p> 
<p>Jim Martin has been a fixture in the 4-H program and the fair since he and 
his family moved to Pagosa Springs 11 years ago. His wife, Pam, calls Jim the 
&quot;ultimate handyman&quot; who has developed great knowledge and know-how in 
everything from automotive maintenance to computers to construction. She says 
he's very handy to have around.</p> 
<p>The Fair Board would echo these sentiments and Jim is our man of each and 
every day with the electrical knowledge and know-how that he brings to the 
fairgrounds.</p> 
<p>While Jim and Pam did not participate in 4-H until they moved here, Jim was 
a member of Future Farmers of America while he was in high school in California 
and enjoyed raising lambs as his FFA project.</p> 
<p>Jim and Pam became immersed in 4-H when they moved to Pagosa Springs and 
their three children became fascinated with the thought of showing a steer.</p> 
<p>From that time on, Michelle, Jacob and Mitchell were heavily involved in 
4-H and Jim and Pam followed as dutiful parents. It wasn't long before they 
were asked to assist behind the scenes at the livestock auction, which they 
still do today.</p> 
<p>The Fair Board is indebted to Jim for his tireless electrical work that 
enables the fair to be what it is today.</p>

<p><b>Dawn, dusk now offer best angling odds </b></p> 
<p><b>By Tom Carosello</b></p> 
<p><b>Staff Writer </b></p> 
<p>Midday stream fishing in Pagosa Country has slowed a bit due to falling 
flows and higher water temperatures.</p> 
<p>Anglers casting to shaded flats, pockets behind midstream boulders and to 
undercut banks will likely encounter a few fish during the heat of the day, but 
most fish are waiting until the cooler hours of early morning and late 
afternoon to feed aggressively.</p> 
<p>Another advantage to fishing near dawn and dusk is stealth - the potential 
for more strikes rises since trout are now easily spooked by even the slightest 
shadow that falls across a likely lie during daylight hours.</p> 
<p>Area reservoirs are also warming and algae blooms and subsurface plant 
growth in some of the area's shallow lakes is beginning to make shoreline 
fishing difficult.</p> 
<p>Lakes at higher elevations are currently the best bet for steady shoreline 
action since they are not affected as much by plant growth as lower, warmer 
bodies of water.</p> 
<p>The following is a breakdown of conditions at some regional fishing hot 
spots:</p> 
<p>- San Juan River (through town) - Stocked recently by the Colorado Division 
of Wildlife. Flow is clear and is averaging roughly 120 cubic feet per second. 
Anglers using spinners, flies, marabou jigs and streamers are reporting decent 
catches of rainbows along with a few browns. From junction of U.S. 160 and U.S. 
84 through town to Apache St., daily bag limit for trout is two fish.</p> 
<p>- Echo Lake - Aquatic vegetation growth is hindering shoreline anglers, but 
largemouth bass, crappie, sunfish and perch are being taken on live bait, 
ultralight jigs and small plastics. Trout are holding deep mid-day, but hitting 
early and late on attractor flies, bright marabou jigs, spinners, flatfish, 
salmon eggs, nightcrawlers and PowerBait. All bass between 12-15 inches must be 
released immediately; daily bag for yellow perch is unlimited, statewide limits 
apply to all other species.</p> 
<p>- Williams Creek Reservoir - Fishing for rainbow, cutthroat and brook trout 
is best in the early morning and late afternoon with live bait, jigs in orange 
and red, and spinners in gold, silver and fluorescents. Surface bite picks up 
near dusk, especially along the west shore. Kokanee salmon are deep, but some 
anglers are reporting occasional success near the inlet.</p> 
<p>- Navajo Reservoir - Lake elevation is holding at just under 6,032 feet and 
water temperature is 70 degrees in the main channel, with higher readings in 
the canyon portions of the lake. Catfish and Northern Pike are biting well at 
Windsurf Beach and Arboles Point. Some trout are being caught with silver and 
green-colored lures.</p> 
<p>- Big Meadows Reservoir - Fishing for rainbow and brook trout is best in 
8-10 feet of water near the inlets and slower in the main lake body. Successful 
anglers are using rainbow pattern Fin-S-Fish, marabou jigs in red and orange, 
PowerBait, flies and flashy spinners.</p> 
<p>- Piedra River - Flow is clear and averaging 110 cubic feet per second. 
Browns and rainbows are the predominant catch and are hitting flies, streamers 
and metallic spinners. Fishing is restricted to the use of artificial flies and 
lures only; daily bag limit and possession limit for trout is two fish.</p> 
<p>- Fourmile Creek - Flow is clear and falling. Brook trout and cutthroat are 
the main catch in the upper stream, while rainbows and browns are hitting 
attractor-pattern flies and lightweight spinners in the lower stretch.</p> 
<p>- Williams Creek - Water near the campgrounds continues to see heavy 
pressure but the creek is clear and fishing well along its entirety, especially 
in canyon stretches. Flies and small spinners are working well for brookies, 
cutthroats, browns and rainbows near the dam. Browns and rainbows are the main 
catch farther downstream.</p> 
<p>- East Fork of San Juan - Flow is clear, but falling. Recently stocked by 
DOW. Fishing for pan-sized rainbows and browns is fair in deeper runs in the 
early morning and toward evening.<b> </b></p>

<p><b>Renewing old angler kinships</b></p> 
<p><b>with serious trout searches</b></p> 
<p><b>By Chuck McGuire</b></p> 
<p><b>SUN Columnist</b></p> 
<p>I love trout. Or, perhaps more appropriately, I revere trout.</p> 
<p>To say I love them might imply I enjoy eating them, when I really don't. In 
fact, as much as I do enjoy a fresh fish dinner now and then, trout are not 
among my favorite entrees, like walleye, catfish, or sockeye salmon. Although, 
if I were compelled to eat a trout, it would likely be a batter-fried brookie 
cooked next to some eggs, in a pan of sizzling bacon grease.</p> 
<p>I do &#138; like trout though. As vibrant living creatures, I like most 
everything about them, and I've learned a great deal from them over the years.
</p> 
<p>I was probably 7 or 8 years old when I caught my first trout. I can't say 
exactly what kind it was, or even what I caught it on, but I remember taking it 
from a small stream in central Iowa, while camping with my mother, father, and 
older brother.</p> 
<p>We had pitched an old green canvas tent in a state park campground for a 
few days, and spent much of our time hiking trails through the hardwood forest, 
swimming the nearby lake, and occasionally fishing the narrow creek meandering 
through the park.</p> 
<p>Of course, trout are a cold water species, and streams flowing through 
central Iowa are typically quite warm. As a result, the park stream could not 
support a self-sustaining trout population, and its fish were regularly stocked 
as part of a &quot;put-and-take&quot; program.</p> 
<p>But that didn't matter much to me as a young angler just learning to fish 
creeks, particularly when a state hatchery truck came twice a week and dumped 
dozens of silvery shimmering fish into select pools, just for the taking. As I 
recall, within a day or two, most were quickly harvested by folks who'd 
memorized the stocking schedule, and competition was sometimes fierce, but I 
did finally manage to catch one.</p> 
<p>Another 15 years passed before I discovered the magic (and mystery) of wild 
trout fishing in the cold, gin-clear streams of northeastern Wisconsin. As a 
young adult, I had three good friends who loved to camp and fish, and a few 
times each year, we'd pack our spinning rods into two VW camper vans and head 
north to Hayward in the northwest corner of the state. We always stayed at the 
same small resort, and after a few days of lake fishing for bass, pike, and 
walleye, we'd head east to the Nicolet National Forest northeast of Rhinelander.
</p> 
<p>Several small, brush-choked streams flow through the forest, and each is 
home to a good population of brook trout. Their overhanging banks are soft and 
spongy, and the water, while relatively deep, is so clear, that a careful and 
deliberate approach is essential to avoid being seen by the wary little 
creatures.</p> 
<p>Unfortunately, as accomplished lake fishermen, we struggled with proper 
lure selection, and even throwing the right spinners in such tight quarters was 
never easy. When we did manage a decent cast, our approach often spooked the 
fish before our offerings ever hit the water. Only rarely could we hook one, 
and most were too small to keep, but the few we did catch were incredibly 
colorful. Naturally, much larger fish were plainly visible at times, we just 
couldn't outsmart them.</p> 
<p>A few years later I took a new direction in life, and moved west to the 
Colorado mountains where high alpine summits, sprawling aspen and conifer 
forests, and 22 million acres of public lands beckoned. Having left the 
sometimes hot, sometimes bitter cold, and always humid midwestern flatlands 
behind, I was completely enthralled with my new surroundings. The sky was such 
a deep blue, the cool air so pure and fresh, and the rivers and creeks were 
icy-cold and crystal-clear. Aside from the boundless winter skiing, summer 
camping, and year-round hiking prospects, I knew I had arrived in genuine trout 
country.</p> 
<p>Living in a virtual outdoor nirvana, it wasn't long before I met and 
befriended a couple of serious trout fisherman. Bobby was an ardent angler with 
an incredible talent for taking trout from fast-moving streams with an 
ultra-light rod and small spinner. Glenn, on the other hand, was an avid 
flyfisherman and seasonal back-country guide.</p> 
<p>I had never cast a flyrod before, much less caught anything on one, so I 
was naturally drawn to Bobby and his Diawa rod with the open-faced Shimano 
reel. Not long after acquiring a similar outfit of my own (my Midwestern tackle 
was too heavy), Bobby and I became fast friends, and set out to catch every 
trout in the high country. In the process, we explored many miles of 
innumerable rivers and small streams, and I learned volumes on trout behavior 
and reading water.</p> 
<p>Meanwhile, Glenn was a part-time mountain resident, content with spending 
winters basking in the Florida sunshine. Consequently, it took a little longer 
for our friendship to blossom, but as it did, he suggested I try flyfishing.</p>
<p>Glenn was originally from New England, and had flyfished for many years. 
But with the movie, &quot;A River Runs Through It,&quot; still years from 
release, the eventual nationwide flyfishing &quot;craze&quot; hadn't yet begun, 
and my exposure to the sport had, until his suggestion, been fairly limited. 
Nevertheless, when Glenn offered to teach me the basics, I was more than mildly 
intrigued.</p> 
<p>I lived in an apartment on the banks of the Eagle River at the time, and 
worked four nights a week in a popular local nightclub. With my days free and a 
three-day weekend every week, I fished emphatically, and caught on rather fast. 
By my second season, Glenn had me guiding part-time, and eventually I developed 
my own full-time outfitting business.</p> 
<p>I have developed other outdoor interests over the years, and still guide on 
occasion, but many of my idle summer days are now devoted to casually renewing 
old kinships with my friends, the cutthroat, brown, rainbow, and brook trout of 
the Rocky Mountains. I don't fish with the deliberation I once did, and am 
mostly content to see if any are willing to rise to a dry fly. To facilitate a 
safe release, I always fish barbless hooks, and never seem able to keep even a 
brook trout for the breakfast table anymore. I guess my growing admiration and 
affection for them all have made it impossible to decide who lives and who has 
to die on any given day.</p> 
<p>Trout are beautiful creatures. While strong and vibrant and perfectly 
suited to a sensitive environment, their distinct features and vivid coloring 
make them a joy to behold. But it is their perceived innocence after having 
been caught, that almost fearful expression as they appear to wonder what is 
next, that has taught me kindness, compassion, and love for all living things.
</p> 
<p>Trout fishing has tempered my judgment over the years, and it has made me a 
better human being. And, as Robert Traver once wrote, &quot;trout do not lie or 
cheat and cannot be bought or bribed or impressed by power, but respond only to 
quietude and humility and endless patience.&quot;</p> 
<p>I do love trout.</p>

<p><b>LA deputy enters guilty plea in Bayfield poaching </b></p> 
<p>A recently resolved court case involving the Colorado Division of Wildlife 
(DOW) highlights the serious nature of illegally killing big game animals.</p> 
<p>The case demonstrates the efforts of wildlife officers, prosecutors, and 
judges in attempting to stop the practice of illegally killing Colorado's big 
game animals.</p> 
<p>The killing of a deer north of Bayfield in October resulted in a lengthy 
investigation for the DOW. The case started with the alleged after-dark, 
spotlight shooting of a mule deer buck on private property Oct. 21.</p> 
<p>Witnesses informed wildlife officers they heard several shots come from the 
area of a county road near the Coolwater Ranch property. When witnesses 
investigated they came across several men near a truck with California license 
plates. The suspects left the area when witnesses went to contact law 
enforcement.</p> 
<p>District Wildlife Manager Cary Carron responded and returned to search the 
area the following morning. He discovered the dead deer on private property 
bordering La Plata County Road 501. Evidence was collected at the scene.</p> 
<p>Several wildlife officers, led by Carron, found the suspect vehicle at a 
hunting camp in the Saul's Creek area. In all, 10 suspects were interviewed, 
but all denied any involvement in, or knowledge of, the killing of the deer. 
Officers questioned the suspects and collected evidence at the camp, including 
seizing the pickup truck identified by witnesses.</p> 
<p>For the next six months, DOW officers continued to pursue leads, 
re-interview suspects, analyze and compile evidence, and, eventually, gain 
arrest warrants for the suspects.</p> 
<p>The investigation determined that Frank G. Bowne III, a Los Angeles County 
sheriff's deputy, was the person who illegally shot the deer. Two other parties 
also were charged. Because of the hard work of those investigating this case, 
guilty pleas were entered by the following parties:</p> 
<p>- Frank G. Bowne III, Lancaster, Calif.; illegal take of one deer; fines 
and court costs of $4,199;</p> 
<p>- Rodney Ludington Jr., Aztec, N.M.; second- degree criminal trespass; fine 
of $159; 10 days in jail (suspended); and 24 hours useful public service;</p> 
<p>- Sig Hall IV, Queen Creek, Ariz.; second-degree criminal trespass; fine of 
$159; 10 days in jail (suspended); and 24 hours useful public service.</p> 
<p>Credit for this successful prosecution goes to Carron and other officers 
from the DOW office in Durango.</p> 
<p>Assistance in the case was provided by the Colorado Bureau of 
Investigations; the La Plata County Sheriff's Office; the district attorney's 
office; the New Mexico Department of Game and Fish; the California Department 
of Fish and Game; and the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department.</p> 
<p>Bighorn ram slain</p> 
<p>In a separate case, wildlife officer Bailey Franklin was notified that a 
bighorn sheep ram had been seen in the Axial Basin area south of Craig. This 
was a significant sighting because the area is not near any significant bighorn 
sheep populations.</p> 
<p>Approximately a week after learning about the existence of the sheep, 
Franklin was contacted regarding the illegal killing of the animal. Franklin 
began an investigation and through numerous interviews developed a list of 
suspects in the case.</p> 
<p>An interview with suspected poacher Shane Baker led to a confession about 
the bighorn's killing and the whereabouts of the evidence. Baker stated he had 
been hunting cow elk with his two cousins in the Axial Basin area Dec. 6 when 
they spotted the bighorn ram. Baker said one of his cousins, Seth Campbell, 
shot and wounded that sheep, and that Baker had &quot;finished the animal 
off&quot; with his rifle.</p> 
<p>The cousins loaded the dead animal into a pickup truck and transported it 
to the home of Shane Baker's father, who lives north of Craig. Baker confessed 
that his father was very angry that the illegal animal had been brought on his 
property.</p> 
<p>Now frightened about the illegal killing, the cousins went about cutting up 
the ram in an effort to destroy the evidence. According to Baker, pieces of the 
ram were disposed of in the Moffat County landfill, while the ram's horns and 
skull were cut up with a saw, crushed, and scattered along a county road. After 
several hours of searching for evidence through deep snow along the county road 
where Baker stated that he had disposed of the horns and skull, wildlife 
officers found pieces of the bighorn sheep.</p> 
<p>Charges were filed against Shane Baker and Seth Campbell in January. On May 
26 Baker and Campbell appeared in Moffat County District Court to accept a plea 
bargain agreement and were sentenced on the following charges:</p> 
<p>- CRS 33-6-109(1) - Illegal possession of wildlife;</p> 
<p>- CRS 33-6-119(2) - Waste of wildlife;</p> 
<p>- 33-6-107(3) - Hunting without a proper and valid license;</p> 
<p>- 18-8-610(1)(a) - Tampering/destruction of evidence.</p> 
<p>Baker and Campbell were assessed fines of $15,599 each and may still face a 
lengthy loss of hunting privileges, at the discretion of the Colorado Wildlife 
Commission.</p>

<p><b>Sage-grouse status comment period extended to July 30 </b></p> 
<p>The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service announced it published a notice in the 
Federal Register July 9 to extend the deadline for submitting information and 
comments regarding the status of the greater sage-grouse until Friday, July 30.
</p> 
<p>Information and comments related to this status review previously provided 
need not be resubmitted.</p> 
<p>The Service determined in a positive 90-day finding released April 16 that 
three petitions to list the species provided substantial biological information 
warranting a more in-depth examination of the status of greater sage-grouse, 
and this review is now underway.</p> 
<p>Greater sage-grouse are found in Colorado, Washington, Oregon, Idaho, 
Montana, North Dakota, eastern California, Nevada, Utah, South Dakota and 
Wyoming. They are also found in the Canadian province of Alberta and 
Saskatchewan.</p> 
<p>&quot;A key part of this status review is gathering the best available 
scientific information related to the status of the greater sage-grouse and its 
habitat,&quot; said Steve Williams Fish and Wildlife Service director. &quot;We 
are taking this step today in an effort to provide as much opportunity for 
public input as possible while at the same time allowing us to meet our 
statutory deadline for making a final decision on the petitions. We will 
continue to monitor the situation.&quot;</p> 
<p>Anyone wishing to submit information regarding the greater sage-grouse may 
do so by writing to the Field Supervisor, Wyoming Ecological Services Office, 
Suite 4000, Airport Parkway, Cheyenne, Wyoming, 82001 or by e-mail to 
&lt;fw6_sagegrouse@fws.gov&gt;.</p> 
<p>This status review will determine whether the greater sage-grouse warrants 
a subsequent Service proposal to list the species as threatened or endangered. 
To ensure this status review is comprehensive, the Service is soliciting 
information from state and federal natural resource agencies and all interested 
parties regarding the greater sage-grouse and its sagebrush habitat.</p>

<p><b>Navajo State Park wins Starburst Award</b></p> 
<p>Navajo State Park near Arboles was one of the winners of the 2004 Regional 
Starburst Awards announced at a ceremony at Hyland Hills Water World in Federal 
Heights this month. The park was recognized for excellence in the use of 
Colorado Lottery proceeds for parks and recreation projects. Those dollars come 
from the sale of Powerball, Lotto, Cash 5 and Scratch tickets.</p> 
<p>Starburst Awards were presented in five geographic regions and five 
different categories, based on the total cost of the project. The criteria for 
awards are creative and cost-efficient use of Lottery funds, the economic and 
social impact of the project and community participation. The Navajo State Park 
Rehabilitation was the western region winner for projects over $1 million.</p> 
<p>This 40 year-old amenity in southwestern Colorado was due for an overhaul. 
The facilities - all constructed in the late 1960s -were inadequate to meet the 
needs of today's outdoor enthusiasts. Areas that had been designated for 
camping when visitation was light, were later deemed to be environmentally 
sensitive, and not adequate to meet the increased park usage of the 21st 
century.</p> 
<p>New facilities at the park include three campground areas with 119 
designated campsites, electrical hookups, water and sewer hookups, wheelchair 
accessible facilities, heated camper service buildings with showers and three 
rental cabins. The park also now offers group picnic areas, five miles of 
trail, a fish cleaning station, and a new visitor center with a conference room 
and interpretive displays.</p> 
<p>The renovation of the park was part of an effort by Colorado State Parks to 
rehabilitate its amenities on the Western Slope, in partnership with the U.S. 
Bureau of Reclamation, which paid for half of the $7 million project costs. The 
other half was paid by Lottery proceeds through Colorado State Parks and GOCO.
</p> 
<p>Winners of the regional awards received a plaque. Winners of the statewide 
awards will be announced at the Colorado Park and Recreation Association (CPRA) 
Annual Conference in Breckenridge on September 23, 2004.</p> 
<p>The regional winners today also received signage for their award-winning 
facilities, designating them as having won a Starburst Award.</p> 
<p>Judges for the 2004 Starburst Awards were CPRA Board President Mary Colton 
of Highlands Ranch Metropolitan Districts Parks and Open Space, Lakewood 
Community Resources Director Kathy Hodgson who is currently serving as the 
chairman of the CPRA Directors Section, and Metro State College Leisure 
Services faculty member Mary Ann Loeffler.</p>

<p><b>Voter registration</b></p> 
<p>Dear Editor,</p> 
<p>There seems to be a local misconception regarding the meaning of being 
registered as an unaffiliated voter or an independent voter. Perhaps, this 
results from the fact the State of Colorado doesn't recognize the Independent 
Party as a party, as some other states do.</p> 
<p>Therefore, there are no &quot;independent&quot; voters in this state.</p> 
<p>You are either unaffiliated or affiliated with one of the recognized 
parties, such as Democrat, Republican, Green, etc. As this awareness spreads, 
we can, hopefully, eliminate the confusion by choosing to use the 
&quot;unaffiliated&quot; term.</p> 
<p>Some great news for unaffiliated voters is the &quot;extra&quot; 
opportunity you get to voice your opinions - an invitation to vote in the 
primary election of your choice. I say &quot;invitation&quot; because once you 
arrive at the polling place to vote, you must actually affiliate with the party 
in order to cast a vote. All you need to do after Election Day has passed is go 
to the county clerk's office and re-register as unaffiliated, if you choose to 
keep that status for the general elections (or peace of mind). You might give 
the clerk's office a couple days after Election Day to finish up the election 
and avoid a possible trip back to their office.</p> 
<p>Another voter opportunity is early primary voting at the county clerk's 
office, in the courthouse, 8 a.m.-4 p.m. Aug. 2-6. The county clerk is hopeful 
to offer early voting on July 30, too, so you can check on this as the date 
approaches.</p> 
<p>Voters should make sure to bring a valid photo ID card to the polls, as new 
voting rules apply to elections this year.</p> 
<p>Voters may also apply for absentee ballots, leaving little reason for not 
casting your critical votes. Absentee ballot applications are available now 
from the county clerk's office. The last day to request absentee ballots to be 
mailed to local addresses is 4 p.m. Aug. 3. The last day to physically pick up 
an absentee ballot is 4 p.m. Aug. 6. If you are requesting an absentee ballot, 
be advised that the completed ballot must be back in the clerk's office by 7 
p.m. Aug.10, the primary election day, to be counted.</p> 
<p>If you're not registered to vote, it's a simple process, and the staff at 
the county clerk's office can assist you in filling out the forms. Social 
Security numbers need not be disclosed. It is not too late to register to vote 
in the November election. Deadline to register to vote for the general election 
is Oct. 4.</p> 
<p>If you are now more confused than ever, the best bet is to contact the 
county clerk's office at 264-8350 and have them explain the details to your 
satisfaction.</p> 
<p>Mark your calendars for the League of Women Voters' candidates' forum 7 
p.m., Monday, July 26. Meet the county commissioner candidates at 6:30 p.m.</p> 
<p>Please vote - your future depends on it!</p>

<p><b>Patriotism belongs </b></p> 
<p>Dear Editor:</p> 
<p>In response to Kate Terry's Local Chatter column regarding criticism of too 
much little flag waving and floats with too much red white and blue colors I 
have to say that those who don't want to see patriotism in our parade should 
stay at home.</p> 
<p>Let's not forget what Independence Day is all about. This is not the Rose 
Bowl parade after all. I was told that Durango's 4th of July parade was not 
nearly as nice as ours, which I thought was great.</p> 
<p>The crowd turnout was fantastic. I have one criticism about the fact that 
there were absolutely no lights turned on at the high school grounds when the 
fireworks were over. People were stumbling their way through the dark, trying 
to find the door opening in the fenced-in area.</p> 
<p>Some folks brought flashlights, but most never thought they would be needed.
</p> 
<p>Paula Bain</p> 
<p><b>Level the field</b></p> 
<p>This letter is first a plea to the hierarchy of the Archuleta County 
Republican Party to level the field of competition for the &quot;primary 
election&quot; in August. The treatment of the two well-qualified candidates 
who petitioned to be placed on the primary ballot for the two open commissioner 
seats, is a slap in the face to those &quot;Republicans&quot; who had enough 
interest in getting the best possible candidates to sign the petitions.</p> 
<p>The choice to protect the two incumbents to the exclusion of any other 
willing Republican candidate leaves some serious questions.</p> 
<p>At a time when the question of maintenance of county roads may be the most 
expensive faced by the taxpayers, it should not be forgotten that both 
incumbents were in office when the Pagosa Lakes road problems came to a head. 
Further it should not be forgotten that when the incumbents were advised of the 
road project problems and the fact that there was a contractor's bond in the 
amount of $5.2 million still available, they failed to act. (Now a new tax levy 
is proposed to remedy past failures of construction and maintenance of roads).
</p> 
<p>Subsequent litigation against the county for failure to supervise the road 
project was dismissed by the courts for procedural reasons based on the two 
agreements between the commissioners and PLPOA that had excluded the 
taxpayer/property owners as beneficiaries of the project.</p> 
<p>It should be noted that the courts never addressed the merits of the case 
and that the county never denied the allegations of failure to manage the 
project.</p> 
<p>The county taxpayers, left without a judicial remedy have only one way to 
be heard. That is the &quot;election&quot; process. It is the only way that 
incumbents who have not served the best interest of the taxpayers and property 
owners can be removed.</p> 
<p>Should the Republican electorate of Archuleta County not have the 
opportunity to determine who really is the best candidate?</p> 
<p>Glenn Bergmann</p> 
<p><b>Gas well foe</b></p> 
<p>Dear Editor:</p> 
<p>I would like to take this opportunity to express the concern I have for the 
proposed drilling of gas wells in the HD Mountains and the devastating impact 
it will have on pristine roadless areas in the San Juan National Forest in 
Archuleta County.</p> 
<p>It appears the National Forest Service is willing to disregard existing 
environmental protections and bow to the greed of the oil companies who, with 
the unyielding support of the White House, have a fast track to approval.</p> 
<p>Rather than protect the very essence of their being the NFS is ensuring the 
destruction of virgin, uncut, old growth forests. By the development of some 36 
miles of roads in an area of approximately 12,700 acres the very existence of 
archaeological ruins dating back more than 1,000 years, hangs in the balance.
</p> 
<p>During this long term drought water is far more important to our future 
survival in the desert southwest than the petty amount of gas that will be 
extracted from these wells during their brief 10-plus years of productivity. 
For this short-term gain, the NFS is willing to sacrifice the quality of the 
water wells of all residents and ranchers in the area by submitting to the 
pressure our current president and his administration are applying for the 
development of these gas wells.</p> 
<p>To put into perspective the magnitude of the impact to our public lands the 
drilling will create, I have accumulated these facts:</p> 
<p>The Roadless Area, which is in the crosshairs of this development where 36 
miles of road will be cut into virgin, uncut forest, is approximately 12,700 
acres (19.8 square miles). The city of Durango is 9.6 square miles with 68 
miles of roads. Can you imagine how forever changed the forest will be with 
road density more than a quarter of that of a city.</p> 
<p>The impact of this development will be felt personally, too. The DOW game 
management unit in which I hunt will be turned into a noisy, polluted, almost 
completely deforested wasteland. A piece of heaven on earth turned into another 
dump at the hands of our government.</p> 
<p>Thank you very much for giving your time to hear my voice.</p>

<p><b>In response</b></p> 
<p>Dear Editor:</p> 
<p>In response to Mr. McVean's letter in the July 8 SUN:</p> 
<p>As you know, some countries use the comma in place of a period. It would 
appear Mr. McVean's homeland is one of those countries. Had Mr. McVean read 
past the comma in the sentence containing my quote, he would have realized the 
obvious connection is that of death.</p> 
<p>Further, the immediately preceding paragraph stated the all elusive 
&quot;fact&quot; - I do not believe government should make decisions for its 
people, when those people are capable and willing to make decisions for 
themselves. Realizing this, to many people, is an alien thought, I understand 
McVean's unwillingness to recognize or acknowledge the concept. Being unable to 
believe any person, with a reasonable command of the English language, could 
not comprehend Mrs. Baker's clearly written article, I leave open the 
possibility that someone is just jerking my chain.</p> 
<p>If that's not the case: Mr. McVean, until and unless you have a firm grasp 
of the issue, you should, as I have been correctly advised many times, sit 
silent, and appear ignorant, rather than speak and remove all doubt.</p> 
<p>As to your characterization of my comment being childlike: Why don't you go 
eat worms?</p>

<p><b>Not debatable</b></p> 
<p>Dear Editor:</p> 
<p>The controversy occurring in the country over same-sex marriage, shouldn't 
even be debatable. A constitutional amendment banning something like this is 
preposterous.</p> 
<p>The Constitution and the Bill of Rights were created to give all Americans 
rights, not take them away. These rights (should) apply to everyone, regardless 
of race, religion, sex, or sexuality. Among these rights is the &quot;pursuit 
of happiness&quot;.</p> 
<p>Banning same-sex marriage is a violation of these unalienable rights. If 
two people want to get married, it doesn't hurt or even concern the public. We, 
as Americans, live by certain laws and rights that shouldn't be affected by the 
opinions of one or two powerful people.</p> 
<p>Please consider this before our government amends the Constitution and 
strips American citizens of their birthrights.</p>

<p>Dear Editor:</p> 
<p>The Pagosa Springs Music Boosters have made history right here in Trujillo

<p><b>Parade points</b></p> 
<p>Dear Editor:</p> 
<p>I enjoyed Kate Terry's Local Chatter comments about our 4th of July Parade, 
and ways to improve it next year.</p> 
<p>It is a fact that ten people could be asked, and there would be ten 
different opinions about what to add and what to delete from future parades.</p>
<p>There is so much planning, hard work, thought and expense that goes into 
the numerous floats and entries of other kinds. We have always loved the parade 
and look forward to it each year. We would never plan to be gone on the 4th!</p>
<p>I mostly agree with Kate and her ideas, with a little modification here and 
there. I love the older automobiles that travel to Pagosa from far and near, 
showing us that the past is still here with the sound of loud pipes and wheels 
that spin and burn rubber. I loved it then, and now! The louder the better.</p> 
<p>Fourth of July means having fun, and not in a quiet way.</p> 
<p>We have enjoyed this parade for 12 years, and from the beginning I have 
wished for more music. Hurrah for the floats that have music and dancing! There 
needs to be music all through the parade, not just in three spurts. I also like 
my music loud and lively.</p> 
<p>Hats off to those who organize the parade and dedicate so much time to it 
all year long.</p> 
<p>As for the political entries, I usually ignore those and vote for the ones 
who choose to watch the parade instead.</p> 
<p>Keep up the great tradition, and thanks again for all the years it has been 
a great success.</p>

<p><b>Rebutting rebuttal</b></p> 
<p>Dear Editor:</p> 
<p>I do not want to start a dialog with either Tom DeRossett Jr. or Eugene 
Witkowski but I would appreciate the opportunity to reply to their letters in 
the July 8 SUN that were, in turn, directed at my letter of July 1.</p> 
<p>To summarize my letter, I mentioned two statements that the president and 
other administration officials have made that did much to convince the American 
people and Congress to support the invasion of Iraq. These, on the evidence, 
were knowingly false. I then compared these actions to President Clinton's lies 
for which impeachment proceedings were brought, and asked why, when the 
consequences of the actions of the two presidents were compared, Clinton should 
be impeached and Bush reelected.</p> 
<p>I thought that any responses would be directed to the assumptions and ideas 
in my letter. In fact, neither one addresses these points, most specifically, 
why Bush should be reelected if Clinton's actions called for impeachment. Early 
on Tom writes &quot;... Ted can find no 'clear' al-Queda connection to Saddam's 
oppressive government.&quot; I neither said nor implied any such idea. What I 
did say was that there was no evidence that Saddam had been involved in the 
tragedy of Sept. 11, 2001. These are completely different concepts. He then 
accuses me of comparing &quot;... Clinton's sexual immorality to the immorality 
surrounding war in general and throws President Bush into the middle of it. A 
long jump Ted.&quot; I did not compare Clinton's actions to war in general but, 
specifically, to Bush's actions that were similar to Clinton's. I would say, 
Tom, that you made a spectacular leap. He then discusses a number of other 
unrelated topics and ascribes to me other rationalizations and implications 
that have no basis in anything I wrote. Nowhere does he address the thesis of 
my letter.</p> 
<p>Mr. Witkowski, on the other hand, spends most of his letter discussing the 
evidence for weapons of mass destruction (WMD). If he will reread my letter, he 
will notice that the only time these weapons were even obliquely referred to 
was the misinformation that Saddam was trying to buy uranium from Niger.</p> 
<p>It might surprise Mr. Witkowski that I believe there was much information 
supporting the idea that Iraq had WMD. There also was other information 
questioning this conclusion. Unfortunately, we won't know if the contrary view 
reached the administration before the war until after the upcoming election. No 
matter, whether Bush did or did not believe that WMD were or were not likely to 
be found, he was not justified in repeatedly giving false information to the 
country to further his cause. Again, as with Tom's reply, no effort has been 
made to rebut the &quot;facts&quot; in my letter or to answer the question.</p>

<p><b>Royalty abounds</b></p> 
<p>Dear Editor:</p> 
<p>This letter is in response to Kate Terry's column, &quot;Local 
Chatter.&quot; Specifically regarding the importance she places on our local 
royalty.</p> 
<p>I love her idea for the Red Ryder Royalty to follow the Grand Marshal in 
the 4th of July Parade.&nbsp; Because I am on the County Fair Board, I also 
want to give kudos to our royalty, as well as the Spanish Fiesta Royalty.&nbsp; 
All girls work exceptionally hard all year and represent Pagosa Springs with 
class and grace.&nbsp; They all should be recognized and congratulated.</p> 
<p>On behalf of the entire fair board, I would like to congratulate the 2004 
Red Ryder royalty, Chelsea Montroy and Keyton Nash-Putnam.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Congratulations also goes to Spanish Fiesta Royalty, Victoria Espinosa, 
Wendy Webster, and Alyssa Laydon.&nbsp; And finally, congrats to the County 
Fair royalty, Brea Thompson, Allison Laverty, and Leslie Baughman.&nbsp; Way to 
go girls.&nbsp; It would be terrific if all the girls, from all three of our 
local royalty could follow the Grand Marshal in the Parade.&nbsp; Great Idea!

<p><b>Pagosa's young shooters in Pennsylvania event </b></p> 
<p><b>By Kate Terry </b></p> 
<p><b>SUN Columnist</b></p> 
<p>The kids in Pagosa Springs do get around!</p> 
<p>Five of them will be in Mansfield, Pennsylvania, July 26-30, attending the 
International Youth Hunter Education Challenge sponsored by the National Rifle 
Challenge sponsored by the National Rifle Association of America.</p> 
<p>The qualifying attendees are: Dusty Bauer, Zane and Cole Kraetsch and 
Benellen and Allison Laverty.</p> 
<p>Judd Cooney and Mike Kraetsch are accompanying them as coaches. </p> 
<p>The event will last four days. All are staying in dormitories on the campus 
of Mansfield University. Mansfield is located in Tioga County in the very north 
center of Pennsylvania.</p> 
<p>This international event is a fantastic opportunity to display learned 
skills and to acquire new ones. And of course, they are making new friends.</p> 
<p>The agenda calls for two categories: one having to do with responsibilities 
and the other field events. Those having to do with responsibilities include: 
Wild Life Identification; Hunter Safety Trail; Hunter Responsibility 
Examination; and orienteering (maps and campers studies).</p> 
<p>Field activities include: the use of three guns - rifles, muzzleloaders and 
shotguns, and one archery activity.</p> 
<p>To help finance the trip, the Pagosa Bow Club held a benefit shoot on the 
Laverty Ranch and raised $14,000. People have been most generous. The kids are 
going to have a great time.</p> 
<p><b>Fun on the run</b></p> 
<p>A farmer finally decided to buy a TV. The store assured him that its 
personnel would install the antenna and TV the next day.</p> 
<p>The next evening the farmer turned on his new TV and found only political 
ads on every channel. The next morning he turned the TV on and found only 
political ads again.</p> 
<p>When he came in to eat lunch he tried the TV again, but still only found 
political ads.</p> 
<p>The next day - when he still found only political ads - he called the store 
to complain. The owner said that it was impossible for every channel to only 
have political ads, but agreed to send a repairman to check the TV.</p> 
<p>When the TV repairman turned on the TV he found that the farmer was right. 
After looking at the TV for a while he went outside to check the antenna. In a 
few minutes he returned and told the farmer he had found the problem. The 
antenna had been installed on top of the windmill and grounded to the manure 
spreader.</p>

<p><b>Picnic in the Park is this week, not next </b></p> 
<p><b>By Laura Bedard</b></p> 
<p><b>SUN Columnist</b></p> 
<p>It's time for Picnic in the Park this week, despite what I said last week!
</p> 
<p>This month we will be serving lunch in Town Park at noon Friday. Dawnie and 
her staff always serve a great meal and the Mountain Harmony Choir will be 
entertaining us as well. Be sure to eat with us in the park and enjoy good 
food, fresh air, fine friends and music.</p> 
<p>There is a lot going on this Saturday as well. Our group is going to Creede 
Repertory theatre for a noon production of &quot;Ladder to the Moon.&quot; We 
will be going to Creede again Aug. 7 for the production of 
&quot;Spitfire.&quot; We get group discounts and we try to carpool to save 
money, so if you are interested in going next month, we will start a sign up 
list the end of this month. Don't miss out on Creede.</p> 
<p>We will also have a Star Party in the community center parking lot 
Saturday. We will meet about 8:30 p.m. and set up our telescopes. (Feel free to 
bring your own if you have one). We ask you to bring a chair, warm clothing and 
an interest in astronomy. Our own Sam Matthews has a telescope and some 
knowledge to share, so join us in becoming &quot;starry eyed.&quot;</p> 
<p>We will have Ronnie Doctor here at noon July 19 to encourage people to 
volunteer at the Archuleta County Fair. This is a great way to meet new people 
and have some fun as well. Be sure to have lunch with us and sign up to 
volunteer at the fair.</p> 
<p>We will be going to Sky Ute Casino July 20. If you wish to join us, please 
sign up in the dining room. The ride down and back doesn't cost anything and 
they give you some freebies as well, so you have no excuse not to have some fun.
</p> 
<p>Enza Bomkamp will be here at 1 p.m. July 20 to explain hospice to us. Find 
out how you can be involved in hospice or how hospice might be able to help you.
</p> 
<p>If you are interested in obtaining a stairway chair lift, we might be able 
to help. Anna O'Reilly has a used Excel chair lift that works on a 12-foot 
stairway. It is an oatmeal colored chair and is in excellent condition. Anna is 
asking for $1,800 OBO. Call her at 731-2727 for more information.</p> 
<p>Don't forget Game Day July 22. People were shy about coming in last month, 
although we had a bunch of prizes designated for Bingo, and a number of other 
board and card games available. Come in for lunch and stay for an afternoon of 
game playing.</p> 
<p>Our free Movie Day is July 23. This month's feature is &quot;In 
America.&quot; This is supposed to be a light hearted look at immigrants trying 
to make a go of it in this country. Show starts at 1 p.m. in the lounge and 
popcorn is only 25 cents.</p> 
<p><b>Benefits of walking</b></p> 
<p>If a daily fitness walk could be put in a pill, it would be one of the most 
popular prescriptions in the world. It has so many health benefits. Walking can 
reduce the risk of many diseases - from heart attack and stroke to hip fracture 
and glaucoma. These may sound like claims on a bottle of snake oil, but they're 
backed by major research. Walking requires no prescription, the risk of side 
effects is very low, and the benefits are numerous:</p> 
<p>- Managing your weight. Keeping your weight within healthy limits can lower 
your risks of type 2 diabetes, heart disease, stroke, cancer, sleep apnea and 
osteoarthritis.</p> 
<p>- Controlling your blood pressure. Physical activity strengthens the heart 
so it can pump more blood with less effort. Staying fit is just as effective as 
some medications in keeping down blood pressure levels.</p> 
<p>- Decreasing your risk of heart attack. Brisk walking for three hours a 
week - or just half an hour a day, is associated with a 30-40 percent lower 
risk of heart disease in women.</p> 
<p>- Reducing your risk of breast cancer and Type 2 diabetes. People at high 
risk of diabetes can cut their risk in half by combining consistent exercise 
like walking with lower fat intake and only a 5-7 percent weight loss.</p> 
<p>Regular exercise can avoid your need for gallstone surgery and protect 
against hip fracture. It can also prevent depression, lower stress levels, 
improve sleep and lengthen lifespan.</p> 
<p>A steady routine is the most important factor in getting the most out of 
your exercise regimen. Walking for 30 minutes five times a week is recommended.

<p>The wood card catalog must go in the next few weeks. You are invited to 
make a silent bid on it. Come in the library and look it over. The numerous 
drawers can be used for many purposes. It is a good looking piece of furniture.
</p> 
<p>If you are interested, please put the amount you bid in a sealed envelope

<p><b>Quilt show</b></p> 
<p>I want to thank members of the Piecemakers for selling more bookmarks at 
their elegant quilt show over the Fourth of July weekend. We are now at the 
stage when we find out how much we still have to raise. We will be announcing 
some major challenge grants soon. Every bit helps, and the Piecemakers continue

the Civic Club Bazaar this November.</p>

<p>We are just weeks away from our groundbreaking ceremonies. The plans are in

await the go-ahead to put that first shovel in the ground.</p> 
<p>The contractor is estimating the project will take five months. If we get 
going soon we can be dried in before bad weather. The plan is to do as much on 
the new addition as possible before having to disrupt the current library 
services.</p> 
<p>We will keep you posted as to the schedule and time line as we learn it. 
For those of you who use the library computers, we are trying to locate all of 
the places you may go for that service. The community center and WolfTracks are

and this Saturday you can cash in on all that affection at our Annual 
Membership Appreciation Car Wash from 11 a.m. until 2 p.m. in the Visitor 
Center parking lot. </p> 
<p>Yep, the Chamber staff and Board of Directors (and some lucky spouses) will 
wash your vehicle for nada, zippo, nothing at all just to show our undying 
gratitude for your membership. I will caution you that if you are not a member, 
that same wash will ding you $10 - membership does indeed have its privileges, 
you know.</p> 
<p>Please come by and say hello and enjoy the supreme and rare pleasure of 
watching all of us actually working, sweating and having a whale of a good time 
helping everyone shine just a little brighter. Well, to be perfectly honest, I 
must confess that it will most likely not be the best car wash you've ever had, 
but it could be the most enjoyable because we're just so doggoned cute and ever 
so much fun to be around.</p> 
<p>If you so choose, please bring $5 to buy the opportunity to win a year's

in the hat. At any rate, please stop by to say hello on Saturday and leave with 
a cleaner car than you brought in. Come to think of it, that's pretty much the 
only promise we've ever made: You are sure to leave with a cleaner car than the 
one you drove in. I know it's not much, but what can I tell you about a bunch 
of novice car washers? Hope to see you all on Saturday at the Visitor Center.

<p></p> <b>Veteran's Corner</b> 
<p></p> 
<p><b>Veterans records center is making access easier </b></p> 
<p><b>By Andy Fautheree</b></p> 
<p><b>SUN Columnist</b></p> 
<p>The National Personnel Records Center (NPRC) is working to make it easier 
for veterans with Internet access to obtain copies of documents from their 
military files.</p> 
<p>Military veterans, and the next of kin of deceased former service members, 
can use a new online military personnel records system to request documents. 
Others who need documents must still complete the Standard Form 180 (SF180), 
which can be downloaded from the National Archives and Records Administration 
(NARA) Web site www.archives.gov/research_room/vetrecs/index.html. Or, I have 
these forms here at the Archuleta County Veterans Service Office and will be 
happy to assist you in filling out the proper form.</p> 
<p><b>Better service</b></p> 
<p>The new Web-based application was designed to provide better service on 
these requests by eliminating the records center's mailroom processing time. 
Also, because the requester will be asked to supply all information essential 
for NPRC to process the request, delays that normally occur when NPRC has to 
ask veterans for additional information will be minimized. </p> 
<p>Veterans and next of kin may access this application and find more 
information from the NARA Web site. </p> 
<p><b>DD214 for benefits</b></p> 
<p>The most common military record required for most VA benefits or claims is 
the DD214. This document was issued to all discharged veterans by the late 
1940's. Prior to that time and during WWII the document was called a WD AGO 
Form 53-55. However, if you request a DD214 for any period of service, the NPRC 
will send a copy of the correct military record, if it is available.</p> 
<p>What's this &quot;if available&quot;? Doesn't the NPRC keep all military 
records forever? Unfortunately there was a fire at the NPRC July 12, 1973 that 
destroyed part or all of certain records of about 80 percent of the Army 
personnel discharged between Nov. 1, 1912, and January 1, 1960, and about 75 
percent of the records for Air Force personnel with surnames from 
&quot;Hubbard&quot; through &quot;Z&quot; discharged between Sept. 25, 1947, 
and Jan. 1, 1964.</p> 
<p><b>Records still available</b></p> 
<p>Millions of records, especially medical records, had been withdrawn from 
those groups and loaned to the VA before the fire. The fact that one's records 
are not in NPRC files at a particular time does not mean the records were 
destroyed in the fire. The records can often be rebuilt from the VA if they 
have possession of them.</p> 
<p>If a veteran learns his or her records may have been lost in the fire, they 
may send photocopies of any documents they possess, especially separation 
documents to the NPRC. The NPRC will add those documents to the computerized 
index and file them permanently.</p> 
<p><b>Certified copies</b></p> 
<p>Records sent from NPRC are pressure stamped with a seal that certifies they 
are copies of originals, and will meet all requirements for VA and SSA 
benefits, or any other benefit requiring proof of military service.</p> 
<p><b>Durango VA Clinic</b></p> 
<p>The Durango VA Outpatient Clinic is at 400 S. Camino Del Rio, Suite G, 
Durango, CO, 81301. Phone is 247-2214.</p> 
<p><b>For further information</b></p> 
<p>For information on these and other veterans' benefits please call or stop

county courthouse. The office number is 264-8375, the FAX number is 264-8376,

<p><b>Unitarians will hear Waldorf schooling talk </b></p> 
<p>This Sunday, July 18, The Pagosah Unitarian Universalist Fellowship will 
hold a service describing and explaining Waldorf Schooling, which stresses 
educating the body, soul and spirit of children.</p> 
<p>Edward Norman, doctor of oriental medicine and licensed acupuncturist, will 
the present a program about this form of education, which incorporates the 
research and teachings of Rudolph Steiner, the father of anthroposophy.</p> 
<p>Norman points out the growth and maturation of a human being is a deeply 
complex matter. From a Waldorf perspective, the evolution of a child's 
consciousness is nourished by meeting each developmental state with specific 
support for &quot;inner&quot; processes. These include art, craft, recitation, 
movement, fairy tales, and later - literature, music, mathematics, and 
teacher/role models.</p> 
<p>The curriculum is a tool to gradually reveal the child to him or her self, 
and eventually make each one available to the world, fully empowered. This 
compassionate form of education will soon be coming to Pagosa Springs.</p> 
<p>The service and children's program begins at 4:30 p.m.</p> 
<p>The Fellowship is now meeting in its new permanent home in Unit 15, 
Greenbriar Plaza, on Greenbriar Drive, off North Pagosa Boulevard. Unit 15 is 
on the east (back) side of the commercial plaza. Turn east on Greenbriar Drive 
off of North Pagosa by the Fire Station, then left into the parking lot and 
look for the big new sign. All are welcome.</p> 
<p>On July 25, at 11 a.m., the President of the national Unitarian 
Universalist Association, The Reverend William Sinkford, will speak to the 
combined Unitarian Universalist Fellowships of the Four Corners region. This 
outstanding event, sponsored by the Durango UU Fellowship, will be held in the 
Smiley Building Auditorium, 1305 Third Ave, Durango. As always, everyone is 
invited to attend.</p> 
<p>There will be no service at the Fellowship Hall in Pagosa Springs on July

<p><b>By Karen Carpenter</b></p> 
<p><b>Special to The PREVIEW</b></p> 
<p>We have been cooking, playing volleyball, learning card tricks and the 
magic Chinese linking rings.</p> 
<p>This keeps our hand-eye coordination and math skills from dulling over the 
summer. Some of the teens are quite skilled and are overcoming the dreaded 
&quot;audience factor.&quot;</p> 
<p>Preparations for the upcoming July 30 dance are in the works. Moe and Shan 
Webb will be our DJs. The dance will be our main focus in the weeks ahead.</p> 
<p>We have had many visitors this past week, just checking the Teen Center 
out. I hope they will become part of our Teen Center family.</p> 
<p>It was great to see &quot;The Hills are Alive ...&quot; in support of all 
the cast whom worked so hard over the summer to bring us this musical tribute.

<p><b>Creede readies its third annual rock, mineral show </b></p> 
<p>Creede will host its third annual Mineral County Rock and Mineral Show, 
Saturday and Sunday, Aug. 7 -8, at the Underground Mining Museum.</p> 
<p>The public is invited to attend and admission is free.</p> 
<p>Rock hounds and collectors of all ages can find exhibits of gems, geodes, 
fossils, silver ore, turquoise nuggets, Australian opals, beads, jewelry, and 
stone carvings plus rock and mineral specimens from around the world. This 
year's show features a meteorite specialist, stone cutting demonstrations, gold 
panning, and grab bags filled with intriguing rock specimens.</p> 
<p>At 7 p.m. Saturday, Aug. 7, Charles Downing, one of Creede's foremost rock 
hounds, presents &quot;A Geologic History of Creede&quot; with local rock 
specimens and a hands-on geology demonstration. Downing spent many years 
teaching Creede's youth about earths sciences including the volcanic origins of 
the landscape surrounding their hometown.</p> 
<p>Mineral County holds a wide variety of unusual features like volcanic dikes 
and vents, the famous Wheeler Geologic Area (a classic ash deposit), and the 
Creede Fossil Formation.</p> 
<p>The county's geology has kindled a long legacy of interest and fascination 
from early day prospectors and surveyors to modern mining engineers and 
mineralogists.</p> 
<p>The La Garita Caldera, one of the world's largest calderas, gave birth to 
many formations that serve as landmarks within the Upper Rio Grande Valley. The 
smaller Creede caldera created unusually rich ore deposits that eventually 
fueled the silver boom of the Creede mining district. Millions of dollars worth 
of silver, gold, lead and zinc were extracted annually before the last mine, 
the Homestake, closed in 1988.</p> 
<p>Creede survived fires, floods, mining depressions, and mine closures to 
become known as the &quot;little town that would not die.&quot; The spectacular 
Pillars of Hercules, remnants of an ancient rhyolite wall, frame the town's 
bustling Victorian-era business district which now houses gift shops, 
restaurants, galleries, the Creede Repertory Theatre, and quaint B&amp;Bs. 
Creede recently was cited as one of six outstanding small art communities by 
Artist's magazine.</p> 
<p>Proceeds from exhibitors' fees for the Rock and Mineral Show benefit the 
Creede Underground Community Center. The tunnels and caverns that form the 
center, mining museum, and fire station were blasted into the solid rock walls 
of Willow Creek Canyon by three miners and volunteer helpers after the last 
mine closed. The community project was completed in 1992.</p> 
<p>Creede is a haven for amateur and professional geologists or anyone who 
just enjoys unusual rocks. The 17-mile Bachelor Loop Tour passes old town 
sites, mine buildings, and other relics of Mineral County's silver boom legacy. 
The Underground Mining Museum and the Creede Historical Museum are open from 10 
a.m.-4 p.m. daily. The Last Chance Mine offers on-site tours and rock hounding 
opportunities during the summer weekends.</p>

<p></p> <b>Food for Thought</b> 
<p></p> 
<p><b>It's delicious, but there are too many consonants</b></p> 
<p><b>By Karl Isberg</b></p> 
<p><b>SUN Columnist</b></p> 
<p>Look Ma, I'm Polish!</p> 
<p>So, here's how it went down: my rapid immersion in eastern European picnic 
fare - my conversion.</p> 
<p>It started with a mess of Pieczen Rzymska, sealed in a large plastic 
Ziplock bag.</p> 
<p>We took the bag out of the refrigerator, opened it and we each wadded up 
quite a bit of the stuff.</p> 
<p>And ate it. Pieczen Rzymska.</p> 
<p>Also in the fridge was a similar sealed bag, filled with Cyganska Szynka. 
Sliced.</p> 
<p>Each of us pulled off four or five of the thin slices, rolled them into 
tubes.</p> 
<p>And ate them. Cyganska Szynka.</p> 
<p>Quite nice, if impossible to pronounce. Where do they find all those 
consonants?</p> 
<p>With that, we were ready for the big show, the West Slavic main event.</p> 
<p>Kurt opened the cupboard and pulled out the large jar of Kapusta Kwaszona 
and popped the top.</p> 
<p>&quot;This, brother, is not made by human hands. No, this is otherworldly; 
no mere mortal could have fashioned this. Perfection is beyond the reach of we 
tragically flawed humans. &quot;This&quot; - he held the jar up to the golden 
late afternoon light flooding through the kitchen window - &quot;is the result 
of divine intervention. It's the only explanation. I realize it defies reason, 
but go with your instinct here, bro. Make a leap of faith.&quot;</p> 
<p>I had to admit: It was the darned finest looking Kapusta Kwaszona I had 
seen in a long time.</p> 
<p>If it tasted half as good as it looked, we were in for a transformative 
experience.</p> 
<p>Kurt is my brother. Among other things, he is an oenological whiz and, like 
me, he was infected long ago by the food virus. He is an accomplished and 
daring cook, capable of setting you back in your chair, your troubled mind 
cleared and buffed to a high sheen by an unexpected combination of flavors and 
textures. He knows few peers at the grill and saut&eacute;s with the best of 
them. His food interests, experiences and accomplishments span the culinary 
globe. He is completely at home in the kitchen or the well-stocked cellar.</p> 
<p>What Kurt does best, however, is find obscure sources for rare foods. He 
has prowled everything from the high-end luxury stores, to dingy little holes 
in the wall at the end of ominous alleyways. He has searched out foods and 
recipes on four continents. He can tell you where to find the best paillards in 
Paris, exotic spices in Thailand.</p> 
<p>And, as of last weekend, he can guide you to a source for a jar of killer 
Kapusta Kwazona.</p> 
<p>Kurt was here during the recent Fourth of July holiday weekend. He came 
bearing his family, and gifts.</p> 
<p>Pieczen Rzymska.</p> 
<p>Cyganska Szynka. Sliced.</p> 
<p>Kapusta Kwaszona.</p> 
<p>Two kinds of sausages whose names are so foreign I hesitate to spell them.
</p> 
<p>Foreign, as in Polish.</p> 
<p>Pieczen Siekana (almost like the Dsiadek the old-timers used to make) and 
Parowki something or other.</p> 
<p>&quot;It's an unobtrusive joint called SAWA,&quot; he said, describing his 
supplier. &quot;There's a place where I get the tires on the van changed and to 
get there, you have to drive past this crummy shopette, circa 1960. SAWA moved 
in recently and, at first, the owners didn't identify what SAWA was. Then, when 
I went across town to get the snow tires taken off the van and my summer tires 
put on, I saw added information. The sign read 'SAWA Market - Meats.' I pulled 
a U and found myself in a paradise of sorts: A dimly lit little storefront with 
a meat counter and shelves along the walls.&quot;</p> 
<p>He glowed as he spoke. It was that &quot;I've been to Lourdes&quot; kind of 
glow. The face of someone who has spied a stunning image in a burned tortilla.
</p> 
<p>Kurt launched into a minutely detailed description of the contents of the 
meat counter - a treasure trove of smoked meats and sausages.</p> 
<p>&quot;Polish hams, Karl, three or four deep. And the sausages - so many 
sausages.&quot; At first I was paralyzed. When I finally turned from the meat 
counter to gather my thoughts, I saw a refrigerated case and, next to it, a 
freezer case. The cases were full of pierogi, every kind imaginable. I was 
starting to short out, my circuits were snapping. I turned again and there was 
a bank of shelving and &#138;&quot;</p> 
<p>He got a dreamy look in his eyes and hesitated. For a minute I thought he 
was suffering a flashback, the consequence of a rash moment in the early '70s 
when he thought he knew a whole lot more about native mushrooms than he really 
did.</p> 
<p>Then, I wondered if he was suffering one of those odd ischemic events he's 
prone to. As a young man, he was one of the best hockey players around and paid 
the price with a series of nasty head injuries. You're never quite the same, 
you know.</p> 
<p>But, no. He was recollecting a moment of bliss. Kurt savors the memory of a 
blissful food shopping moment the way he does a gaudily expensive wine - with 
all his soul.</p> 
<p>&quot;The shelves contained the best display of jars of Polish sauerkraut 
I've seen since I went on a sauerkraut safari in Chicago back in 1982,&quot; he 
said. &quot;There were so many jars, I seized up. I knew I had to buy 
something, but I &#138; just &#138; couldn't &#138; do &#138; it. There was a 
young woman sitting on the floor, stocking the lower shelves. I doubted she 
spoke English because she and the man behind the meat counter were yakking 
incessantly in Polish, but I took a chance and asked her: 'Excuse me, miss; I 
know you can answer this question. Which sauerkraut is the best? Tell me.' She 
didn't say a word, she didn't look away from her business on the bottom shelf. 
She simply reached up, extending her arm above her head to the third shelf and 
brought her index finger to rest on top of this jar.&quot;</p> 
<p>Kapusta Kwaszona. Manufactured in Poland by Prezetwory Babuni. No fat, no 
carbs, Recommended serving: 100 grams. Two-hundred milligrams of sodium per 
serving - enough to shred a vein in the heartiest of men come the fourth of 
fifth serving.</p> 
<p>&quot;Here,&quot; said Kurt, handing me a fork. &quot;Try it.&quot;</p> 
<p>I took a bite.</p> 
<p>&quot;Is that superb?&quot; he asked.</p> 
<p>I was crunching away, but I nodded my head up and down. It wasn't overly 
salty, it wasn't heavy or mushy. It was crisp, and light. The essence of 
cabbage.</p> 
<p>&quot;I've eaten three jars of it in the last week,&quot; said Kurt as he 
inhaled a mass of the kraut. &quot;Plus, I whipped up a batch of soup using the 
juice as a base. I had a bit of a problem with gas at first and had to sleep on 
the couch, but I'm over it.&quot;</p> 
<p>&quot;And the sausages?&quot; I asked.</p> 
<p>&quot;There's no way I could try every kind the market offers before I came 
here, but I've sampled about ten types so far.&quot;</p> 
<p>&quot;And?&quot;</p> 
<p>&quot;They make them on site, at SAWA, and these beauties reek of love. I 
have four or five favorites so far, and I've used an entire tank of propane 
firing up the grill to cook them. I brought the top two for you to sample.&quot;
</p> 
<p>Kurt opened the fridge and withdrew a large package from the bottom drawer, 
cradling the white paper-wrapped contents like a baby.</p> 
<p>&quot;This one is terrific,&quot; he said, opening the package like a 
diamond courier opens his case. &quot;This one the guy behind the counter at 
the market calls a 'barbecue sausage.' It's pork and beef, smoked lightly, 
loaded with garlic, spiced with a bit of marjoram and mustard seed if I'm not 
mistaken. It's like the best kielbasa you've ever had, but meatier, more dense. 
No resemblance to the commercial crud in the supermarkets. Look here.&quot; He 
pointed at the center of one of the links where a congealed wad of meat had 
broken to daylight through the natural lamb casing. &quot; Analyze this 
blowout; look at the texture. Amazing.&quot;</p> 
<p>&quot;And the other?&quot; I asked.</p> 
<p>Again, he reached into the bottom drawer and carefully removed a package.
</p> 
<p>&quot;Veal and pork, finely ground,&quot; he said, taking out one of the 
6-inch links of sausage and turning it in front of my eyes. It was thick, 
nearly white, blimp-like. &quot;The refined cousin of a bratwurst, delicate, 
ready to split open, to offer itself to you when cooked to perfection.&quot;</p>
<p>I darted to what is left of my deck and ripped the cover off the grill. 
Fifteen minutes later, with the burners cranking max BTUs, all was ready. In 
the meantime, we made a salad and whisked up a coarse mustard/garlic/extra 
virgin olive oil/lemon dressing.</p> 
<p>On to the grill went the meaty treats, with the heat turned down to medium 
high. I oiled up three of four bunches of green onions and put them on the top 
rack of the grill, above the sausages, then I closed the lid.</p> 
<p>Oh, the odors emanating from that hot box. A pack of dogs gathered in the 
street in front of the house. They didn't blink.</p> 
<p>When the sausages were ready, we devoured them slathered with plenty of 
coarse Dijon, and ate the kraut cold. As an extra treat, Kurt broke out a 
bottle of another of Przetwory Babuni's masterpieces: Buraczki Z Chrzanem.</p> 
<p>I don't need to tell you what that is, do I?</p> 
<p>Oh.</p> 
<p>According to it's Made in Poland label, it is &quot;Healthy Food.&quot; Red 
beets with horseradish - beet root, horseradish, spices , sugar, salt and 
vinegar amalgamated into a-Slavic salsa.</p> 
<p>At first we dipped and dabbed bits of sausage alternately into mustard and 
Buraczki Z Chrzanem. Then, we gave up all pretense of civility and ate the 
darned beet and horseradish mix with spoons.</p> 
<p>It was a rollicking good time. By meal's end, I swear I heard accordion 
music in the distance. The dogs were still prowling the street.</p> 
<p>Kurt and family have gone home, Daughter Ivy is back in LA. Kathy and I are 
back to our routine. Everything is back to normal.</p> 
<p>Except, I've been Slavicised.</p> 
<p>I'm uuzsicng xtrcza conzsnecnantcz n vry wrzsd.</p> 
<p>And I'm breaking out the Porkert Fleischacker 10 to make some of that 
Cyganska Szynka.</p> 
<p>I'll grind equal amounts of beef and pork, then run them together through 
increasingly finer blades until they are nearly a paste. The last two grinds or 
so, I'll add some kidney fat (you can get that around here, can't you?) and 
some salt pork. Into the final grind will go egg yolks, onion, savory and salt 
and pepper. I'll form the mix in a loaf pan and bake for an hour or so in a 
bain marie at about 350.</p> 
<p>Once its done, I'll cool it and slice a bit, for a taste test. </p> 
<p>Then, as we say around the Sczbrg house: Letzcs z eyytt!</p>

<p> </p> <b>Cruising with Cruse</b> 
<p></p> 
<p><b>Taking a step back in time to Rendezvous</b></p> 
<p><b>By Katherine Cruse</b></p> 
<p><b>SUN Columnist</b></p> 
<p>Up on Reservoir Hill, on a warm Thursday morning in late June, the 
Rendezvous, a reenactment of the mountain man era, was just getting started. 
The first thing I noticed was the clothing. People were walking around in 
old-time garments.</p> 
<p>A lot of the men had on leather pants, loose cotton shirts, leather 
jackets, and moccasins. There was a lot of fringe, and a lot of beadwork. There 
were hats trimmed with feathers and fur.</p> 
<p>Women wore long calico print skirts and moccasins. I met one woman wearing 
a pink cotton shirt and skirt, very 20th century. She told me, &quot;There's 
some leeway. We have to wear natural fibers, cotton and linen and wool. And our 
clothes have to be 'in the style' of the period.&quot;</p> 
<p>Three young girls walked by with a puppy on a leash. They wore long-ish 
skirts and white blouses. Of the period.</p> 
<p>The period is pre-1840. The place is the mountain West. One man, all in 
leather and beads, said the original mountain men started out with European 
style clothes and gradually replaced them with whatever was available.</p> 
<p>I asked him if these re-enacters portrayed specific historical figures. He 
said, &quot;It's more fun to create your own character.&quot;</p> 
<p>At the original rendezvous camps, the trappers brought in their beaver 
pelts and the companies they had contracted with brought in supplies of flour, 
coffee, liquor - whatever the men needed to get them through another season of 
trapping beaver.</p> 
<p>The man in charge of a rendezvous is called the booshway, a corruption from 
the French word bourgeois, which originally meant someone who was in between 
peasants and landowners. I guess that would be an administrator.</p> 
<p>At the registration cabin, a large sign spelled out the rules for visitors. 
We were advised the tents were people's homes and we should respect their 
privacy. If the flap was closed, you should call out and see if anyone was home 
and if they wanted visitors.</p> 
<p>The mountain men's tents were either tepees or straight-sided tents, all of 
them made of white canvas. Campsites had chairs made of two boards attached 
together to form a modified X. Water was kept in a small barrel on a wooden 
frame. Iron pots stood beside rock lined fire pits and metal stirring spoons 
hanging on lines strung among the trees. But because of the fire danger, all 
cooking had to be done on propane stoves. They looked incongruous among all the 
period equipment.</p> 
<p>One man invited me to look in his tepee and showed me the bending motion 
you needed to get through the entrance gracefully. Inside, a metal pot with 
three legs welded onto it sat on a base of stone. That was his heating system. 
There was a low bed, covered with a fur spread. More furs and boxes were placed 
around the edge.</p> 
<p>&quot;What do you do if it rains?&quot; You close the flaps. Some water 
runs down the wooden poles.</p> 
<p>At another campsite a man sat reading a book. A small bird clung to his 
shirt collar, pecking at his hair. &quot;This is Clyde,&quot; the man told me. 
Clyde is a young starling. The night before, Clyde had disappeared, flown the 
coop. The man's wife found him by accident. When she went to soak in the 
springs, people warned her about &quot;this crazy bird.&quot; While he told me 
this story, Clyde flew over to land on my hat.</p> 
<p>At the merchandise tents you could buy knives and guns and tomahawks, which 
everyone seemed to call hawks. You could buy calico skirts and leather shirts 
and leather bags of all sizes, or a pair of moccasins.</p> 
<p>I spoke to a young woman who was sitting by a table selling moccasins she'd 
made herself, along with 19th century reproduction scissors. She looked to be 
about 16. &quot;How long have you been coming to these Rendezvous events?&quot; 
I asked. &quot;Eleven years,&quot; she said proudly. &quot;Do you like 
it?&quot; I asked, thinking maybe she felt dragged along by her parents. 
&quot;Oh, yes.&quot;</p> 
<p>In a roped-off area a young woman in a long leather skirt was engaged in 
target practice, hurling first a knife and then a hawk (the kind with a blade, 
not feathers) at a wooden target. The knife blade was about 6 inches long. It's 
best to have a leather handle on your knife, not a wooden one. The leather 
handle stands up to the stress better. The hawk blades came in a variety of 
shapes. You can get a hawk from a guy in Ignacio who makes them, if you know 
how to reach him.</p> 
<p>The shooting practice was delayed that morning, as hikers were spotted on 
the trails behind the shooting area. Someone left to alert the authorities. Two 
Parks and Rec staffers cleared the trails and put up warning signs, and the 
shooting commenced.</p> 
<p>At the shooting site, a large poster listed the rules. Two men were loading 
their rifles at a table, pouring in the powder and tamping down the small piece 
of fabric known as a patch, walking to the firing line &quot;with muzzles 
pointing up.&quot; They took aim at paper targets pinned to a long black wall. 
One gun made a small flash of light and a &quot;Poof&quot; sound.</p> 
<p>Durango Dave, the range master, said that was a flash in the pan. He 
explained the intricacies of black powder shooting to me. He showed me the pan, 
the frizzen, the flint. He had me watch to see where the patch flew as a gun 
fired.</p> 
<p>Clyde's owner showed up with a rifle and a pistol. Clyde had fallen asleep 
and was back at the campsite in his cage.</p> 
<p>At the shooting range there are some concessions to 20th century 
technology. People wore plastic ear plugs. Several of the men wore glasses. 
Dave said he didn't think mountain men with bad eyesight would have lasted very 
long.</p> 
<p>The two men shooting finished their timed practice, and the range master 
announced, &quot;The firing range is closed.&quot;</p> 
<p>My time at the Rendezvous had also come to an end, so I said good-bye. 
Durango Dave invited me to attend the monthly black powder shoot held in 
Durango. I said I'd think about it.</p>

<p></p> <b>Pagosa Lakes News</b> 
<p></p> 
<p><b>Season change makes existence 'bearly' visible </b></p> 
<p><b>By Ming Steen</b></p> 
<p><b>SUN Columnist</b></p> 
<p>Along with the change in seasons comes the change in type of nocturnal 
visitors.</p> 
<p>During this time of year Margaret Gallegos, manager of the PLPOA Department 
of Covenant Compliance, and her staff receive calls from property owners who 
have been visited by bears.</p> 
<p>According to Gallegos, &quot;garbage can attack first took place in Pagosa 
Vista, followed by Martinez Mountain I, Twincreek Village, and Lake Pagosa Park 
... reports were also received in the north, from Pagosa Highlands.&quot;</p> 
<p>Since animals think with their stomachs, they follow their noses. Your 
garbage poly-cart, fondly dubbed as &quot;deli-cart&quot; by the Division of 
Wildlife employees, is a huge magnet for bears. To eliminate the temptation, 
store your garbage poly-cart, dog and cat food inside your garage - out of 
sight and smell.</p> 
<p>Some of our local bears have already associated with humans with a reliable 
and varied food source. Stop that association immediately by taking steps to 
ensure that your trash is not available to them. Morning walkers and runners 
witness bear carnage on a daily basis. The sight is often sickeningly messy 
with the crows and magpies adding to the problem of scattering the trash 
further afield. I've seen bear scats loaded with bits and pieces of plastic and 
foil in Martinez Canyon. (My friends make fun of my scatological interest).</p> 
<p>One a bear finds a good, dependable food source, it will keep returning. 
You can, however, take the necessary steps to disinvite it for dinner. Here are 
some do's from Gallegos:</p> 
<p>- empty garbage cans regularly;</p> 
<p>- periodically clean garbage cans to reduce odor that attracts animals, 
using hot water and bleach;</p> 
<p>- place garbage for pickup outside just before collection and not the night 
before;</p> 
<p>- store trash in a closed garage or shed;</p> 
<p>- tightly secure your containers;</p> 
<p>- talk to your neighbors and remind one another to take care of the trash - 
offer to help if they're to be out of towns on pick-up day.</p> 
<p>That which gives us great joy (like close and abundant wildlife) can also 
give us headaches (like trash-eating bears. Let's take care of the headache and 
move on to enjoy the abundant ducks and ducklings on the lakes, especially 
Vista Lake (next to the PLPOA administrative building) and Lake Forest. There 
is quite a variety of waterfowl to observe.</p> 
<p>Boat owners who have their boats left by the shores of Lake Hatcher, Lake 
Pagosa and Lake Forest must lock up the vessel to the posts provided. Please do

<p>The xeriscape project at the recreation center is currently in progress. 
Work will be undertaken in phases and this summer's effort will be primarily 
focused around the entrance. In a couple of weeks we hope to have a variety of

<p>By Debra Stowe</p> 
<p>Now four years since your passing</p> 
<p>I wonder how that can be.</p> 
<p>It seems like only yesterday</p> 
<p>Those big brown eyes looked up at me.</p> 
<p>I know you keep watch over us.</p> 
<p>I've felt you by my side,</p> 
<p>Seeing &quot;your boys&quot; accomplishments</p> 
<p>And knowing you beamed with pride.</p> 
<p>Though time continues its march,</p> 
<p>My thoughts return to days gone by.</p> 
<p>So sweet daughter,</p> 
<p>Allow me these moments of sorrow</p> 
<p>And of asking again, God, why?</p> 
<p>Then I'll go back to my life today,</p> 
<p>With strength and faith anew</p> 
<p>And humbly I'll thank the Lord</p> 
<p>For the years we had with you.</p> 
<p>You blessed our lives with your laughter.</p> 
<p>How I ache to see your smile;</p> 
<p>But I wipe away these tears</p> 
<p>And plod onward for awhile.</p> 
<p>The journey may be a long one.</p> 
<p>At times I just don't care ...</p> 
<p>Trusting God's mercy to the end</p> 
<p>I know that you wait for us there</p>

<p><b>SUN Columnist</b></p> 
<p>What started out as a short conference call with Southwest Youth Corps 
administrators has turned out to be quite beneficial for the town of Pagosa 
Springs, especially, Reservoir Hill Park.</p> 
<p>Preliminary talks included discussion of having a work force come work on 
trails, water bars, mulching, and general maintenance. We finalized the 
contract with a $15,000 grant award from the United States Forest Service and 
Bureau of Land Management.</p> 
<p>The Southwest Youth Corps (SYC) mission statement says: &quot;It is the 
mission of SYC to provide young men and women of the Four Corners region with 
structured, safe, and challenging work and education opportunities through 
employment projects that promote personal growth, the development of social 
skills, and an ethic of natural resource stewardship.&quot;</p> 
<p>The Corps is one of more than 120 programs established in the nation, based 
on a model originated in the 1930's with the development of the Civilian 
Conservation Corps (CCC).</p> 
<p>The SWC has worked on many projects in the San Juan Basin area doing 
revegetation, trail construction/maintenance, landscaping, campground 
improvement, wetland rehabilitation, fire fuels reduction, and removal of 
invasive weeds.</p> 
<p>The 2004 Pagosa project includes water bar repair, pruning, and building a 
new trail. The crew is the most qualified of all the SYC groups, known as the 
&quot;leadership Crew,&quot; and we will be getting seven workers for a total 
of 10 days. The crew will be camping on Reservoir Hill starting July 19.</p> 
<p>Construction will take place on Trails 2 and 13. Trail 2 historically has 
gone through the gate on the very east end of the park. We are working with the 
owners of the property to get the gate unlocked. We will sign an easement or 
possibly try to purchase enough property to allow the trail to go on through to 
the San Juan Overlook site.</p> 
<p>The temporary fix for this problem will be to have SYC build/merge Trails 2 
and 13 to go around the gate.</p> 
<p>We look forward to seeing progress on the trails and making our little 
piece of wilderness improved for our enjoyment.</p> 
<p><b>Spanish Fiesta</b> </p> 
<p>The 24th Annual Spanish Fiesta will be held this weekend in Town Park. Come 
enjoy the Hispanic Heritage by attending the parade, purchasing some good food, 
and enjoying entertainment. All proceeds go to provide scholarships for the 
local youth of our community. Support all the hard work this group has put 
forth, to carrying on this annual event that benefits so many.</p> 
<p><b>Soccer sign-ups</b></p> 
<p>Sign-ups for the 2004 Youth Soccer League season will take place July 
19-Aug. 13. Cost per player is $20 ($10 for each additional child)</p> 
<p>Age divisions for the league are: 5-6, 7-8, 9-10, 11-12-13 (Child's age by

<p></p> 
<p><b>Cosby comments apply here </b></p> 
<p>Several weeks ago, Bill Cosby, one of the nation's most renowned 
entertainment industry personalities, sent a shock wave through the African 
American community with comments about cultural standards and habits - remarks 
some interpreted as overly harsh. Others went so far as to accuse Cosby of 
feeding the racist stereotypes used by others against African Americans. Cosby 
made statements in May that received similar responses.</p> 
<p>In brief, Cosby has criticized segments of the black community for the 
perpetuation of low standards regarding education and grammar, reminding them 
of the economic and social consequences of their behavior and accusing some 
members of the community of wasting the gains made by the civil rights movement.
</p> 
<p>Cosby continued by citing the effects of certain kinds of entertainment on 
youngsters and holding parents responsible for creating environments that work 
contrary to their children's best interests.</p> 
<p>The most interesting thing about Cosby's comments is that the concern he 
exhibits holds true for all racial, social and economic groups in the U.S. His 
points ring as true here in Pagosa Springs as they do in neighborhoods in 
Chicago, Newark or Los Angeles. The difference is merely one of style. The 
problems he highlights, and their consequences, are the same.</p> 
<p>Children here are as prey to the abusive, violent and maudlin text of much 
of contemporary entertainment as any. Too much of the television programming, 
movies and music directed to youngsters are delivered without conscience. Too 
many youngsters are permitted access to entertainment meant for adults.</p> 
<p>A child here who comes from a broken family or whose environment is stained 
by violence that results from the thwarted ambition and frustrations of parents 
can be damaged. </p> 
<p>The increasing trend in aggressive parental behavior directed toward school 
systems, administrators and teachers - in reaction to academic and behavioral 
demands made by the institutions - does incredible damage to youngsters. The 
rise of self-congratulatory bumper sticker education - &quot;My child is an 
honor student at &#138;&quot; - while parental pressures erode standards at 
schools is of no benefit to our children's future. The toleration and excusing 
of behaviors by parents who either do not have the fortitude to deal with a 
child at home or whose self images are so fragile they cannot tolerate 
criticism of them or their child is ultimately negative.</p> 
<p>Children here, as much as anywhere, witness unreasonable behavior from 
parents at athletic events, listen to derogatory dialogue at home that demeans 
people and situations deserving of respect, and we expect what kind of behavior 
out of a child? When schools, the law, our system of values and traditions are 
ridiculed, what chance does a child have of succeeding once he or she is no 
longer with mommy and daddy? What kind of table is being set? What barriers are 
being erected?</p> 
<p>Adults everywhere have to remember that what they do to and around children 
counts. We need to remember that being involved in a child's life does not mean 
excusing a child, intervening to shield them from accountability. We should 
promote a child's independence hand in hand with nurturing and reinforcing the 
concept of responsibility.</p> 
<p>If adults do not take care to create and support environments wherein 
children can be genuinely tested and rewarded - ones in which the child can, 
when warranted, actually fail - we will have done our kids a disservice.</p> 
<p>If adults cannot distinguish what is fit for adults from what is fit for 
youngsters, they will harm their children.</p> 
<p>If parents immerse their children in a cauldron of domestic abuse and 
violence, the child will be burned.</p> 
<p>Let's move Cosby's comments to a broader context. The essence of what he 
says is correct. Everywhere. </p>

<p><b>A taxing means of existence</b></p> 
<p><b>By Richard Walter</b></p> 
<p><b>Staff Writer</b></p> 
<p>I'm relieved.</p> 
<p>The big date in every jobholder's year has passed - and I'm happy to have 
played my role.</p> 
<p>July 4 and its glowing celebration? </p> 
<p>No, July 8 is the key date here. </p> 
<p>That was the date when, according to Americans for Tax Reform, the average 
American wage earner has accumulated enough gross income to pay his or her 
share of all local, state and federal government taxes plus the cost of 
regulation. They call it Cost of Government Day.</p> 
<p>The reporting group noted &quot;working people must toil on average 189 
days out of the year just to meet all the costs imposed by government.&quot;</p>
<p>What the group doesn't say is that its calculations indicate you were 
unable to keep anything for yourself in those first 189 days.</p> 
<p>Rent, mortgage, car payment, medical bills, utilities all went unpaid for 
189 days in this scenario. Perhaps more importantly, your family didn't eat, 
buy school clothes, purchase laundry supplies or even buy a boom box.</p> 
<p>U.S. Rep. Joel Hefley of Colorado said, &quot;If you're exhausted from 
work, but don't feel as though you're making a significant dent in your 
personal and household bills, it could be because of all the money you're 
spending to cover your very own personal share of the cost of running your 
government.&quot;</p> 
<p>That said, the solon gave the rate of federal spending his &quot;Porker of 
the Week&quot; Award.</p> 
<p>One statistic he cited is even more frightening than those alluded to 
earlier. &quot;It is absurd,&quot; he said, &quot;that the cost of government 
consumes 51.6 percent of national income levels, and is proof that we still 
have a tremendous amount of work to do to reduce the nation's tax levels and 
prevent government spending from growing out of control.&quot;</p> 
<p>I'd think most people would believe that having Uncle Sam (and his local 
and state nephews) take more than half your annual income means spending 
already is out of control.</p> 
<p>In the old days you might have found a grocer who'd carry your tab for over 
six months during bad times, feeling pretty sure you'd pay it off when times 
improved. I defy you to find that kind of arrangement today.</p> 
<p>The difference is that the government entities actually take all that money 
without you ever getting to hold it in your palm and admire the pictures of 
presidents. </p> 
<p>Withholding tax, it's called. And if not enough is detoured from your bank 
account, you're responsible at the end of the year for paying up, meeting the 
level the venerable politicians have decided is yours.</p> 
<p>It's sort of like the Medicaid fiasco perpetrated on families after 1996 in 
Colorado.</p> 
<p>The federal program administered by the state was used by many elderly 
people as a means of paying for drugs and some forms of care they couldn't 
otherwise afford. Most beneficiaries and their families thought the costs came 
out of taxes paid in the years they worked.</p> 
<p>Not so. When the beneficiaries passed away, the heirs were - and still are 
- billed for every cent spent after that date. A surprise making Cost of 
Government Day itself obsolete.</p>

<p><b>Beaver Biology: Slate of summer programs educate, entertain </b></p> 
<p><b>By Tess Noel Baker</b></p> 
<p><b>Staff Writer</b></p> 
<p>&quot;A fat rodent with big teeth and webbed feet.&quot;</p> 
<p>That's how wildlife biologist Skip Fisher, of the Columbine Ranger District 
introduced his topic for the morning: beavers.</p> 
<p>Eight people followed signs down Snowball Road to Forest Service Road 646 
Friday for a free program on beaver biology offered by Fisher and the San Juan 
National Forest as part of the summer's Interpretive Alliance programming.</p> 
<p>He aimed the talk at the younger set, Tyler and Drew Newton, two boys from 
Georgia visiting Pagosa for a month, and took questions from everyone else as 
he went along.</p> 
<p>&quot;A beaver is an interesting animal because it actually comes into an 
area and makes it the way it wants it,&quot; he said, pointing to an area of 
Snowball Creek that had been dammed and, on the bank, several huge trees felled 
in the area by beavers. </p> 
<p>Their instinct, he said, is to search out the sound of running water, and 
when they find it, to begin building a dam to back up the water, provide safety 
and a nutrient-rich area for food.</p> 
<p>&quot;Now, do you suppose beavers with their really short legs are good at 
running around on land or swimming?&quot; Fisher asked.</p> 
<p>&quot;Swimming,&quot; the boys responded, the right answer.</p> 
<p>To protect themselves, Fisher said, the beavers build a dam to back up the 
water as deep as possible, allowing them escape from predators like cougar or 
coyote. They generally build their lodges a little farther upstream with an 
entrance below the waterline.</p> 
<p>&quot;A beaver can go about 15 minutes underwater without breathing,&quot; 
Fisher said, and move like a torpedo, other adaptations for escaping predators. 
Generally, they prefer a bank den to a lodge when possible. They dig the 
entrance underwater and then dig up to a dry place for their home. Sticks are 
piled on top of the lodge to prevent predators from digging in. A small hole 
remains to allow carbon monoxide to escape the den.</p> 
<p>When a bank den isn't a possibility, the beavers will construct a lodge 
from scratch. They will begin by carting sticks to a spot and poking them into 
the mud. Around and on top of this, mud is piled to create the floor of the 
den. More crosshatched sticks chinked with mud over the living space completes 
the lodge, which generally has two exits, one of which will be underwater.</p> 
<p>Fisher said a large female beaver will be between 55 and 60 pounds. Beavers 
are monogamous - meaning the same pair will stay together for life. Their 
mating strategy is a little unusual.</p> 
<p>&quot;The male and female get together and, from what we can tell, it 
appears they shove each other around,&quot; he said. &quot;Guess who has to win 
for them to stay together?&quot;</p> 
<p>&quot;The female,&quot; was the correct answer. </p> 
<p>&quot;However,&quot; Fisher said, &quot;if one of them dies, it's not like 
with human beings where a lot of tears are shed. Beavers will just go get 
another spouse.&quot;</p> 
<p>Kits, beaver offspring, are usually born in the early summer and will stay 
with their parents until they are about a year and a half old. Fisher said 
litters range between four and nine kits depending on food availability and 
elevation. Once they're old enough to survive on their own, the parents kick 
them out of the den, and the may disperse over many miles.</p> 
<p>&quot;They'll go as far as their parents chase them,&quot; Fisher said.</p> 
<p>As Fisher talked, he showed the group examples of beaver activity along 
Snowball creek, including a dam and the location of an old bank den discovered 
on a short walk. Apparently, the den was abandoned when the dam blew out in a 
storm or during spring runoff.</p> 
<p>&quot;Mother nature wrecks their plans a lot of the time,&quot; he said. 
</p> 
<p>Beavers eat willow, aspen and sometimes grass, depending on availability. 
In the winter, they will actually store some food underwater to conserve energy 
in cold temperatures. They must keep up their chewing, not only to eat, but to 
control the growth of their teeth.</p> 
<p>&quot;It's not like us where if we don't take care of our teeth, we'll lose 
them,&quot; Fisher said. &quot;They're always growing new teeth.&quot;</p> 
<p>&quot;How ideal,&quot; Kristen Newton, a participant, said.</p> 
<p>&quot;You would actually have to eat,&quot; Phyllis Decker replied, with a 
smile.</p> 
<p>Fisher said because of the beaver's inclination to build a home whereever 
they hear running water, they can become a problem for landowners, damming 
water near a road culvert or in some other unwanted area. When that happens, 
three options are available. The beavers can be lethally trapped or shot, they 
can be trapped and moved or a beaver baffler can be maintained to try to direct 
their construction efforts to a different area.</p> 
<p>The beaver biology program was part of the summer's Interpretive Alliance 
series, a calendar of educational programs for visitors and locals alike, most 
of which are free. Partners in the alliance, include: Chimney Rock Interpretive 
Association, Colorado Division of Wildlife, Navajo State Park, Friends of 
Native Cultures, Friends of Navajo State Park, Pagosa Springs Area Chamber of 
Commerce, Pagosa Springs Arts Council, Pagosa Springs Historical Preservation 
Board, San Juan Mountains Association, San Juan Historical Society, San Juan 
National Forest, Southern Ute Indian Cultural Center and TARA (Tiffany, 
Allison, Rosa, Arboles Historical Society).</p> 
<p>For more information on future programs, refer to Kate's Calendar in the 
PREVIEW section of this newspaper or contact, Phyllis Decker at the Pagosa 
Ranger District, 264-1528. Anyone considering one of the outdoor programs 
should be prepared for any kind of weather. Bring water, hat, sunscreen, rain 
gear and appropriate shoes. For outdoor evening programs, bring a chair, 
blanket and flashlight.</p>

<p></p> 
<p><b>Pioneering the San Juans was an unending struggle</b></p> 
<p><b>John M. Motter</b></p> 
<p><b>Staff Writer </b></p> 
<p>Story after story has been passed down telling us how those first pioneers 
in the San Juan Basin made it. Just as in the rest of the nation, pioneering in 
the San Juan Basin required a great deal of grit, perseverance, and plain old 
sweat.</p> 
<p>A story written by Carrie Craig Dyer in 1950 well illustrates the obstacles 
faced and how they were overcome. Dyer's story is contained in &quot;Pioneers 
of the San Juan Country,&quot; Vol. IV.</p> 
<p>Mrs. Dyer's father, William H. Craig, was one of six boys born in Reading, 
Pa. Her grandfather, Andrew Vanderbeck Craig, convinced a farm was the place to 
raise boys, homesteaded a farm in Winthrop, Iowa. His diary written during the 
years 1858-1870 told how land was cleared, neighbors met to raise log cabins, 
every penny was saved to pay property taxes, produce was traded for supplies, a 
wash tub of eggs traded for a bolt of cloth from which the grandmother made the 
boy's shirts and her own dresses and aprons. There being no schools, the 
teachers stayed with various families and taught the youngsters in exchange for 
board.</p> 
<p>Schools were built when more families came. William Craig talked to his 
daughter of singing schools and spelling bees, and riding in a bobsled filled 
with hay, warm stones at their feet and covered with blankets.</p> 
<p>At the close of the Civil War, (about 1866) the two older boys came west. 
One who had fibbed about his age and enlisted as a drummer went to California. 
Mrs. Dyer's father, Bill, settled in Denver. Later he became a contractor and 
hotel keeper. While operating the Windsor Hotel in Denver, he married Mrs. 
Dyer's mother, a visiting Pennsylvania girl.</p> 
<p>When gold was discovered in Cripple Creek on the west side of Pike's Peak, 
he moved his family there with the hope of making his stake. After several 
years of prospecting, he decided a ranch was the proper place for his boys. 
When the Ute Reservation was thrown open for settlement in 1898, he homesteaded 
what became the family home place.</p> 
<p>Homesteading in the San Juan Basin was as much of a problem as it had been 
in Iowa. There was land to clear, sagebrush to grub, a house to build, and 
fences to put in. </p> 
<p>After filing his claim, Bill returned to Cripple Creek, loaded his family 
on a covered wagon, and returned to his new homestead on the Ute Strip. His 
story does not disclose the route he took, but the 10-day journey provided 
wonderful memories for the family.</p> 
<p>&quot;You'll never know why they are called the Rocky Mountains until you 
cross the divide by wagon,&quot; Mrs. Dyer's mother said. The trip was made in 
early fall when wild strawberries and raspberries were plentiful and the 
scenery beautiful. The boys hunted and fished and had a wonderful time.</p> 
<p>While getting started, a house was rented. The house was six miles from 
school in Durango and the children rode to school horseback down the old Indian 
trail. It wasn't long before a house was built and a ranch in operation.</p> 
<p>The old Indian trail crossed the ranch and the Indians often stopped for a 
hand-out. Dad always had something for them. Mother was afraid of them. One 
time when she had gone to Denver on a visit, they stopped and asked dad where 
mother was. Dad said, &quot;White squaw vamoose.&quot; After that, he had a 
hard time convincing them she hadn't gone to the Happy Hunting Ground. Mrs. 
Dyer still has a beaded purse and belt they brought her mother on one of their 
visits.</p> 
<p>Bill started in the cattle business by purchasing 25 dairy calves for $100. 
That fall he and mother went to Aztec for fruit and came home with a Hereford 
calf they bought from a passing herd for $2. He sired the bunch and started the 
Dyer herd. Ponds were built for stock water, but drinking water was hauled from 
nearby springs.</p> 
<p>Everyone said a well would not work, but dad got water at 85 feet and the 
well still works. The first corrals built with cedar posts are still in use.</p>
<p>More next week on pioneering in the San Juan Basin.</p>

<p>It's here.</p> 
<p>Well, at least on its way.</p> 
<p>Since the National Weather Service office in Tucson officially declared the 
start of monsoon season last Thursday, southwest Colorado forecasters have been 
looking for signs the seasonal wind shift is gaining strength here.</p> 
<p>&quot;And it looks like we're starting to see the beginning effects of 
monsoon, now,&quot; says Brian Avery, a forecaster with the NWS office in Grand 
Junction.</p> 
<p>&quot;We've got much more moisture moving into the state than we did a week 
ago,&quot; added Avery. &quot;The odds are rising for increased thunderstorm 
activity.&quot;</p> 
<p>The chance for afternoon and evening showers is best from today through 
Saturday morning, said Avery, although the possibility exists for showers on a 
daily basis through the middle of next week.</p> 
<p>&quot;It looks as if things could dry out a bit by Sunday, but there still 
could be widespread activity into the evening hours each day,&quot; concluded 
Avery.</p> 
<p>According to Avery, spotty clouds this morning will yield to overcast skies 
by this afternoon.</p> 
<p>Chance for afternoon thunderstorms is listed at 50 percent. High 
temperatures should climb into the mid-80s, with lows falling to around 50.</p> 
<p>Friday's weather pattern should be similar, with a 30-percent rain chance, 
highs in the 80s and lows in the 45-55 range.</p> 
<p>The forecasts for Saturday through Monday predict partly-cloudy skies, a 
20-percent chance for afternoon and evening showers, highs in the 80s and lows 
in the upper 40s.</p> 
<p>Tuesday calls for partly-cloudy conditions, a lesser chance for rain, highs 
in the upper 70s and lows around 45.</p> 
<p>Wednesday's forecast includes a 20-percent chance for isolated 
thunderstorms, highs topping 80 degrees and lows in the 40s.</p> 
<p>The average high temperature recorded last week in Pagosa Springs was 84 
degrees. The average low was 46. Moisture totals for the week, in town, 
amounted to zero.</p> 
<p>The Pagosa Ranger District rates the area fire danger as &quot;high.&quot; 
</p> 
<p>Fire restrictions went into effect June 21 in Zone 1, the lower-elevation 
zone, of the San Juan Public Lands.</p> 
<p>The restrictions are Stage 1 restrictions which mean:</p> 
<p>- campfires are limited to permanent fire rings or grates within developed 
campgrounds;</p> 
<p>- smoking is limited to vehicles, buildings, or 3-ft wide areas cleared of 
vegetation;</p> 
<p>- chain saws and other internal-combustion engines must have approved, 
working spark arresters;</p> 
<p>- acetylene and other torches with an open flame may not be used; and,</p> 
<p>- the use of explosives is prohibited.</p> 
<p>For updates on federal fire restrictions, call the Pagosa Ranger District 
office at 264-2268.</p> 
<p>San Juan River flow through town ranged from approximately 170 cubic feet 
per second to 90 cubic feet per second last week. The river's historic median 
flow for the week of July 15 is roughly 210 cubic feet per second.</p>

<p><b>Stage set for start of Pagosa Country monsoon </b></p>

<p>&quot;Monsoon.&quot;</p> 
<p>For many, the word entails heavy rainfall, but according to the National 
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the term is derived from the Arabic 
word &quot;mausim,&quot; which means &quot;wind shift&quot; or 
&quot;season.&quot;</p> 
<p>Such terminology is more accurate, says the NOAA, because the word 
&quot;monsoon&quot; is intended to describe a large-scale change in wind 
direction that may - or may not - result in daily periods of heavy 
precipitation.</p> 
<p>During an average year, a massive ridge of high pressure seated over the 
eastern Pacific Ocean will move eastward as the summer progresses.</p> 
<p>Across the Southwest, the result of such movement is a shift in winds to a 
more southerly direction, which allows increased moisture to track northward 
from the Pacific Ocean and Gulf of California.</p> 
<p>These shifts are most often referred to as the &quot;Mexican Monsoon&quot; 
or &quot;North American Monsoon.&quot; The resulting changes in weather 
patterns are usually observed from early to mid-July through the end of August, 
but will sometimes last until October.</p> 
<p>Such effects are described by the NOAA as a &quot;pattern of bursts and 
breaks.&quot; According to the NOAA, bursts generally bring about rainfall 
while breaks tend to stabilize the atmosphere.</p> 
<p>Bursts are movements of weak troughs in the upper-level, westerly wind into 
the Southwest that spread upper-level, cold air into the region.</p> 
<p>In the lower levels of the atmosphere, strong surface heating and southerly 
winds will then transport moisture into the region, leading to widespread 
thunderstorm activity.</p> 
<p>Breaks occur when enhanced ridges of Pacific subtropical high pressure move 
inland and cut off the moisture flow, temporarily stemming thunderstorm 
outbreaks.</p> 
<p>So when will Pagosa Country see the start of monsoon?</p> 
<p>Chris Cuoco, lead forecaster with the National Weather Service office in 
Grand Junction, says the official monsoon declaration is made by forecasters in 
Tucson, Ariz., though effects may not be seen farther north until the pattern 
gains strength.</p> 
<p>&quot;We refer to them to declare the monsoon when the criteria have been 
met,&quot; said Cuoco, indicating the monsoon is declared in Tucson when the 
daily dewpoint average is 54 degrees or greater for three consecutive days.</p> 
<p>&quot;If they say it's started, that's what we accept,&quot; added Cuoco. 
</p> 
<p>And, according to John Glueck, a forecaster with the NWS Tucson office, the 
monsoon has indeed started - at least in southeast Arizona.</p> 
<p>&quot;We declared it for southeast Arizona last Thursday,&quot; said 
Glueck, &quot;but we only make that determination according to our forecast 
area.&quot;</p> 
<p>Nevertheless, the effects of the monsoon should begin shortly in the Four 
Corners region as moisture continues to push north.</p> 
<p>While most residents welcome its arrival, with the monsoon season come 
hazards.</p> 
<p>While heavy rains will definitely benefit southwestern Colorado, 
back-country travelers and city dwellers alike should be aware of the 
possibility of flash floods during monsoon thunderstorms.</p> 
<p>Areas recently scorched by wildfire and terrain that has received previous 
heavy amounts of rain are especially subject to flash floods.</p> 
<p>When outdoors during thunderstorm activity, hikers and fishermen should 
avoid steep, narrow canyons that can fill rapidly with water at the onset of a 
storm.</p> 
<p>Motorists should avoid driving vehicles into any flooded areas if they are 
unsure of the water depth - a flow depth of two feet is enough to sweep most 
vehicles downstream.</p>
