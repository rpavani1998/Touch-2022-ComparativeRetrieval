<br>
<b>Does sunlight cause skin cancer?</b>
<p> </p>
<p>There is convincing evidence that sunlight causes skin cancer. Skin cancer 
can be treated and cured without serious consequences. However, in some cases 
the condition can be life-threatening if not diagnosed in time.</p> 
<p>Skin cancer is an occupational concern for people who work under the sun. 
The risk however, may be reduced through awareness of the problem, and by 
taking measures to prevent exposure to sunlight.</p> <br>
<b>Are there 
different types of radiation in sunlight?</b>
<p> </p>
<p>Yes. The types of radiation include </p> 
<ul> 
<li>visible light, which gives us the colours we see</li> 
<li>infrared radiation which gives us the warmth we feel</li> 
<li>ultraviolet (UV) radiation</li> </ul> 
<p>Except in extreme situations, neither visible light nor infrared radiation 
from sunlight causes health problems. However, ultraviolet (UV) radiation can 
cause harmful effects to the skin.</p> 
<p>There are three basic types of ultraviolet radiation: </p> 
<ul> 
<li>UVA (long-wave UV)</li> 
<li>UVB (sunburn UV)</li> 
<li>UVC (short-wave UV)</li> </ul>
<p>Table 1 summarizes the general features of each type. </p> <strong>Table 1
</strong> <br>
<strong>Types of Ultraviolet Radiation and Their Features
</strong> <br>
<strong>Ultraviolet Radiation Type</strong> <strong>General 
Features</strong> <br>
Ultraviolet A radiation <br>
 (UVA, long-wave UV) -not 
filtered out in the atmosphere<br>
 -passes through glass <br>
 -produces some 
tanning<br>
 -once considered harmless but now believed harmful over the long 
term<br>
 -levels remain relatively constant throughout the day <br>

Ultraviolet B radiation<br>
 (UVB, sunburn radiation) -some filtered out in the 
atmosphere by the ozone layer<br>
 -does not pass through glass <br>
 -causes 
sunburn, tanning, wrinkling, aging of the skin and skin cancer<br>
 -highest 
intensity at noontime <br>
Ultraviolet C radiation <br>
 (UVC, short-wave UV) 
-filtered out in the atmosphere by the ozone layer before reaching earth<br>
 
-major artificial sources are germicidal lamps<br>
 -burns the skin and causes 
skin cancer <br>
<br>
<br>
<b>How does sunlight affect the skin?</b>
<p></p>
<p>When ultraviolet radiation reaches the skin, some radiation is reflected 
away from the surface. The remaining radiation is scattered into the tissues 
just beneath the skin's surface. A fraction of this radiation is absorbed by 
the skin's living cells.</p> 
<p>Ultraviolet radiation absorbed by living cells damages sensitive substances 
that influence the skin's normal growth and appearance. Damage can result in:
</p> 
<ul> 
<li>sunburn</li> 
<li>increased rate of aging of the skin</li> 
<li>skin cancer</li> </ul> <strong>Sunburn</strong> 
<p>Sunburn is the most familiar and immediate effect of ultraviolet radiation 
on the skin. It is an inflammation caused by an increase in blood-flow beneath 
the skin. The reaction is not normally instantaneous, but reaches a bright red 
colour within 15 to 20 hours. The condition can be very painful and sometimes 
causes peeling of the skin.</p> 
<p>Brief intense exposure can cause severe sunburn in people who are not 
accustomed to strong sunlight. There is evidence that this type of exposure, as 
well as long-term exposures, might be linked to serious forms of skin cancer 
later in life.</p> <strong>Increased Rate of Aging of the Skin</strong> 
<p>Repeated exposure to the sun's ultraviolet radiation eventually causes skin 
damage similar to the aging process. Patches of skin become thin and less 
elastic, and develop blemishes, sun freckles, and wrinkles. These changes may 
take many years of exposure but when they occur, the damage is irreversible.</p>
<strong>Skin Cancer</strong> 
<p>If exposure to sunlight continues for several years, the damaged skin has 
an increased chance of developing one of the forms of skin cancer. Exposure to 
ultraviolet radiation increases the risk of developing these cancers (although 
it may not be the only cause of the disease). While the exact relationship is 
not 100% defined, it appears that intermittent (occasional) exposure and 
exposure during childhood and adolescence are likely important predictors for 
basal cell carcinoma, and cutaneous malignant melanoma. High levels of chronic 
exposure, such as working outdoors, is more often associated with squamous cell 
tumours.</p> 
<p>The following facts also link sunlight exposure to skin cancer: </p> 
<ul> 
<li>Most skin cancer occurs in areas of skin most heavily exposed to sunlight 
(ears, forehead, arms, etc).</li> 
<li>Skin cancer among people who are sensitive to sunlight is more common in 
regions with stronger sunlight.</li> 
<li>People with genetic diseases that make them more sensitive to sunlight 
have a greater chance of developing skin cancer.</li> 
<li>Studies show that ultraviolet radiation similar to sunlight causes skin 
cancer in animals.</li> </ul> <br>
<b>What types of skin cancer are linked to 
sunlight exposure?</b>
<p> </p>
<p>Three different types of skin cancer are linked to sunlight exposure: </p> 
<ul> 
<li>basal cell cancer</li> 
<li>squamous cell cancer</li> 
<li>malignant melanoma</li> </ul>
<p><strong>Basal Cell Cancer</strong></p>
<p>Basal cell cancer is the most common of all cancers in North America and 
Europe. It is usually found in areas of the skin exposed to sunlight, but 
sometimes occurs in other areas as well. This type of skin cancer appears as a 
raised, hard, red or red-grey, pearly wound often found on the forehead, 
eyelids, cheeks, nose, and lips. Although there is always a chance it could 
become serious, basal cell cancer usually does not spread. Most cases are 
easily treated and cured.</p><strong>Squamous Cell Cancer</strong> 
<p>Squamous cell cancer occurs most frequently on the skin exposed to sunlight 
over long periods of time. As such, this type of skin cancer tends to develop 
where maximum exposure to radiation occurs - forehead, cheeks, nose, lower lip, 
and tops of the ears. It also usually develops in areas where the skin has been 
damaged by the sun - areas with blemishes or sun freckles. The blemishes 
develop into rough, scaly patches with small areas of open wound that do not 
heal. They eventually grow into larger wounds with crusts. This type of cancer 
can be removed with a good chance of total cure, if caught in time. It is most 
dangerous if it occurs on mucous membranes such as on the lip.</p> <strong>
Malignant Melanoma</strong> 
<p>Malignant melanoma, although rarer, is the most serious of the skin 
cancers. It often shows itself as a mole or pigment spot that begins to bleed, 
grow, or change its colour, shape or texture. It usually spreads if not treated 
in the early stage. The exact nature of the relationship between malignant 
melanoma and sun light is not completely clear. However, brief intense exposure 
(intermittent exposure) to strong sunlight appears to increase the risk of 
malignant melanoma in people who are not used to strong sunlight. If caught 
early, malignant melanoma can be treated and cured. If treatment is delayed, it 
is often fatal.</p> <br>
<b>What factors affect a person's risk?</b>
<p> </p>
<p>Four main factors influence the risk of skin cancer: </p> 
<ul> 
<li>skin pigment and ability to tan</li> 
<li>heredity</li> 
<li>exposure to chemicals</li> 
<li>amount of exposure to sunlight</li> </ul>
<p><strong>Skin Pigment and Ability to Tan</strong></p>
<p>Ultraviolet radiation from sunlight affects everybody's skin to some 
extent, but the skin's response varies widely from person to person. Peoples' 
sensitivity to the sun varies according to the amount of pigment in the skin 
and the skin's ability to tan.</p>
<p>Ultraviolet radiation causes tanning in two different ways: by immediate 
tanning and by delayed tanning. Immediate tanning causes the skin to darken in 
response to UVA. This darkening begins during the period of exposure, but fades 
within a few hours or days. The amount of tanning increases according to the 
skin's natural darkness and previous amount of tanning.</p> 
<p>Delayed tanning occurs two to three days after exposure to either UVA or 
UVB. It lasts from several weeks to months, and is maintained by repeated 
exposure to sunlight. With delayed tanning, the skin increases its production 
and distribution of dark pigment. The skin also becomes thicker. These changes 
can follow sunburning or develop gradually over a long period of repeated brief 
exposures to sunlight.</p>
<p>Some people burn easily after the first hour of sun exposure following 
winter or any period away from the sun. Other people, especially those with 
dark skin, never burn. This difference in reaction makes it possible to 
classify skin into one of six different types (see Table 2).</p> <b>Table 2</b> 
<br> <strong>Classification of Skin Types</strong> <br>
<strong>Skin Type
</strong> <b>Hair</b> <b>Complexion</b> <b>Freckles</b> <b>Sun Reaction</b> <b>
Tanning</b> <br>
I Red or Blond very fair +++ always burns never tans <br>
II 
Blond fair ++ often burns tans lightly <br>
III Blond or Light Brown fair to 
medium + to 0 sometimes burns tans progressively <br>
IV Brown Olive 0 rarely 
burns tans easily <br>
V Brown to Black dark 0 rarely burns tans deeply <br>
VI 
Black very dark 0 never burns tans deeply <br>
<br>

<p>The risk of skin cancer from the sun generally follows the same pattern. 
Darker skinned people have lower risk of sun-induced skin cancer. The person 
most prone to skin cancer caused by sunlight tans poorly and suffers sunburn 
easily. Frequent and/or intense sunburn in children with fair skin and freckles 
has been linked to malignant melanoma later in life.</p><strong>Heredity
</strong> 
<p>For reasons not completely understood, people with Celtic heritage (Irish, 
Scottish or Northern European) have increased risk of skin cancer from the sun. 
Genetic diseases that affect the skin can also increase the risk. For example, 
albinism, a genetic condition which prevents the production of normal skin 
pigments, makes the skin sensitive to ultraviolet light.</p> <strong>Exposure 
to Chemicals</strong> 
<p>Exposure to certain chemicals can increase the skin's sensitivity to 
ultraviolet light through a process called photosensitization. Examples of such 
chemicals include:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>coal tar pitch and petroleum products containing polycyclic aromatic 
hydrocarbons (PAHs)</li> 
<li>certain printing chemicals used in photosensitive printing processes</li> 
<li>certain drugs and antibiotics such as tetracyclines, sulfonamides, 
thiazide diuretics, chlorpromazine, oral contraceptives</li> 
<li>chemicals called psoralens found naturally in certain plants, fruits and 
vegetables</li> </ul> 
<p>Antibiotics must be taken internally before the skin becomes sensitive to 
sunlight. (Check with your physician or pharmacist is you suspect abnormal or 
severe reaction to sun exposure after taking new medication.) However, simple 
skin contact with psoralens, which are found in figs, parsnips, citrus plants, 
or mouldy celery, can make the skin more susceptible to sunburns in some 
individuals.</p> 
<p>Experimental studies show that chemicals called &quot;promoters&quot; can 
increase the cancer-causing ability of ultraviolet radiation. On the other 
hand, ultraviolet radiation itself can act as a promoter. In particular, 
ultraviolet radiation (UVR) can increase the cancer-causing ability of 
chemicals from coal tar and pitch.</p> <strong>Amount of Exposure to Sunlight
</strong> 
<p>The damaging effects of ultraviolet radiation accumulate over the years. In 
general, the risk of developing skin cancer increases with the amount of time 
spent under the sun and the intensity of radiation. The intensity of radiation 
varies according to the season of the year, time of day, geographic location 
(latitude), elevation above sea level, reflection from surfaces (e.g., white 
sand or concrete, water, snow), stratospheric ozone, clouds, and air pollution.
</p> 
<p>Recent studies have focused on the effects of intermittent (short-term, 
occasional) sun exposure in comparison to chronic (long-term) exposure. It 
appears that the type of exposure may influence the type of cancer that 
develops. For example, intermittent solar exposure may be an important factor 
leading to the onset of basal cell carcinoma of the skin. Childhood sun 
exposure may also play an important part in the development of these cancers 
later in adult life. The pattern for cutaneous melanoma is similar to that for 
basal cell carcinoma.</p> 
<p>In contrast, the relationship between squamous cell carcinoma and solar UVR 
appears to be quite different. For squamous cell tumours, high levels of 
chronic occupational sunlight exposure, especially in the 10 years prior to 
diagnosis, results in an elevated risk for this cancer in the highest exposure 
group.</p> <br>
<b>What is the UV Index?</b>
<p> </p>
<p>In order to address the growing concern by Canadians regarding changes in 
UVR resulting from ozone depletion, Environment Canada rates the UV intensity 
as UV Index on a scale of 0 (when there is no sunlight) to 11+ (extreme). It 
can go to the mid-teens at midday in the tropics. In Canada the UV Index is 
categorized into low (2 or less), moderate (between 3 and 5), high (between 6 
and 7), very high (between 8 and 10) and extreme (greater than 11).</p>
<p>The human health effects and precautions relating to the UV Index are 
summarized in the following table.</p> 
<p><strong>Table 3</strong></p> <br>
<strong>UV Index</strong> <strong>
Description</strong> <strong>Sun Protection Actions</strong> <br>

<ul> 
<li>Minimal sun protection required for normal activity</li> 
<li>Wear sunglasses on bright days. If outside for more than one hour, cover 
up and use sunscreen</li> 
<li>Reflection off snow can nearly double UV strength. Wear sunglasses and 
apply sunscreen</li> </ul> <br>
3 - 5 Moderate 
<ul> 
<li>Take precautions - cover up, wear a hat, sunglasses and sunscreen

<b>How can I reduce the risk of skin cancer from 
sunlight?</b>
<p> </p>
<p>Skin cancer is the result of decades of exposure to the sun. It is 
important to be aware of the risks and take precautions while under the sun 
from as early in life as possible. Approaches to prevent skin cancer include:
</p> 
<ul> 
<li>reducing exposure to sunlight</li> 
<li>wearing protective clothing</li> 
<li>using sunscreens on exposed skin</li> 
<li>examining the skin regularly for suspicious spots</li> </ul> 
<p>In the winter time, it may be advisable to the above precautions when 
exposed to sun for prolonged periods, especially in the presence of snow or at 
high altitudes.</p> <strong>Reducing Exposure</strong> 
<p>Workers should avoid unnecessary exposure to the sun, especially to the 
intense midday rays between 11:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m. during the summer. If 
possible, people should plan outdoor work for early morning or late afternoon, 
and work in the shade as much as possible. Umbrellas, buildings, trees, 
canopies, etc., can protect against the direct rays from the sun. Work, and 
take breaks in the shade when ever possible. Set up shade structures when shade 
is not available. In addition, water, white sand or concrete, snow, and ice can 
reflect from around 10 percent to 85 percent of the sun's ultraviolet 
radiation. Skin may require extra protection against these indirect, reflected 
rays.</p>
<p>Workplaces can also rotate workers between site locations to help reduce UV 
exposure.</p><strong>Wearing Protective Clothing and Sunglasses</strong> 
<p>The use of wide brim hats and clothes made from close-knit fabric can 
protect the skin and scalp from ultraviolet radiation. Although long-sleeved 
shirts and long-legged pants may not be comfortable in extremely hot weather, 
they do help protect the skin. Not all clothing offers the same protection. For 
example, a white cotton T-shirt may have an SPF of 7 while a long-sleaved denim 
shirt has an estimated SPF&nbsp;of 1700. And some fabrics like cotton lose 
about 50% of their SPF&nbsp;rating when they get wet. Workers should be 
informed about different fabric characteristics that effect the transmission of 
sunlight. Also wear wrap-around sunglasses that absorb UVA and UVB radiation.
</p> <strong>Using Protective Sunscreens</strong> 
<p>Workers should liberally apply protective sunscreen on exposed skin 20 
minutes before working in the sun, then reapply it during the periods they 
spend under the sun, as directed by the manufacturer's instructions (usually 
every two hours). Most sunscreens are colourless, invisible, and cosmetically 
acceptable provided they do not stain clothing or produce adverse skin 
reactions.</p> 
<p>Sunscreens should be used in addition to, not instead of, working in shade 
and wearing suitable clothing, hats, and sunglasses. Sunscreens are not 
intended to extend the exposure time to sunlight, but rather to reduce the 
effects of sunlight when people have to be in the sun. The level of protection 
depends greatly on how the sunscreen is applied.</p> 
<p>A wide variety of sunscreens are available. They all contain chemical 
ingredients that weaken (but do not eliminate) the effects of ultraviolet 
radiation. The most widely used protective chemicals are PABA 
(para-aminobenzoic acid) and closely related chemicals such as cinnamates, 
salicylates, benzophenones, or anthranilates. Some sunscreens contain only one 
of these protective chemicals while others may have two or more for greater 
reliability. Products such as baby oil, cocoa butter, or skin oils that do not 
have protective chemicals, do not protect against sunburn, skin aging, or skin 
cancer.</p> 
<p>Manufacturers label sunscreens with a sun protection factor (SPF). The 
higher the factor, the greater the protection from the sun.</p> 
<blockquote> * SPF 15 sunscreen may absorb more than 92 percent of UVB 
radiation.</blockquote> 
<blockquote> * SPF 30 sunscreen may absorb 96.7 percent. </blockquote> 
<blockquote> * SPF 40 sunscreen may absorb 97.5 percent of UVB radiation. 
</blockquote> 
<p>People with skin sensitive to sunlight should use a sunscreen with a high 
SPF. A sunscreen's effectiveness also depends upon its ability to withstand 
heat, humidity and sweat. Most sunscreens are not water-resistant and people 
need to reapply them after perspiring or getting wet.</p>
<p>Sunscreens should be applied 20 minutes before going outdoors, and 
reapplied every two hours, or more often if perspiring.</p>
<p>It is important to try a variety of different types of sunscreen to find 
out which one best suits a particular skin type and activity. The Canadian 
Dermatology Association recommends using sunscreen products with a minimum SPF 
30 or higher (UVA and UVB protection). Use a broad spectrum lip balm with an 
SPF of 30 or higher as well.</p><strong>Examining Skin Regularly</strong>
<p>People who work under the sun should examine their skin regularly for any 
unusual changes. The danger signs include any wound, sore, or patch of skin 
that won't heal or constantly scales. Also examine for any growing lump, 
particularly if brown or bluish in colour. It is important to get medical care 
for anything that looks suspicious rather than wait until the problem becomes 
untreatable.</p>
