<p> </p> <b>Red chokeberry (Aronia arbutifolia, Photinia pyrifolia)</b> <br>

dry to moist soil zones 5-9 <br>
 This is a quietly handsome shrub that thrives 
in a wide range of conditions. It has clusters of white flowers in the spring, 
followed by bright red berries that attract birds. Its brilliant red fall 
foliage ends the year with a bang. 5-10' tall. UConn Plant Database. <br>
&nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br>
<br>
<b>Sweet pepperbush (Clethra alnifolia)</b> <br>

average to moist soil zones 3-9 <br>
 With fragrant white flowers in 
mid-summer, sweet pepperbush is a valuable addition to the landscape. The 
flowers are a magnet for butterflies and bees. 6-9' tall. Prefers acidic soil; 
tolerates ocean spray and road salt. UConn Plant Database. <br>
&nbsp; <br>
<b>
Winterberry holly (Ilex verticillata)</b> <br>
moist to wet soil zones 4-9 <br>

 The glory of this shrub is its berries. They turn red in early fall and 
continue to provide cheer through most of the winter. An ideal shrub for 
pond-side plantings; winterberry loves wet soil, and it looks beautiful 
reflected on the water. Both male and female bushes are needed to get berries; 
one male is enough for half-a-dozen females. Unlike most hollies, winterberry 
is deciduous. Typically 6-10'. UConn Plant Database. <br>
<br>
<b>Mountain 
laurel (Kalmia latifolia)</b> <br>
average to moist soil zones 5-9 <br>
 
Mountain laurel is Connecticut's state flower. In spring, its pale pink flowers 
attract hummingbirds. The leaves stay green all winter; the shrub looks good 
even in very cold weather (unlike evergreen rhododendrons, which curl up their 
leaves and look like they're shivering). Mountain laurel will grow in full sun 
if it has consistently moist soil. In full shade, its form is tall and loose; 
the bare, contorted branches are picturesque. 5-12' tall.UConn Plant Database. 
<br> &nbsp; <br>
<br>
<b>Bayberry (Morella pensylvanica, syn. Myrica 
pensylvanica)</b> <br>
dry to moist soil zones 3-7 <br>
 Bayberry is a tough 
shrub. It grows in nearly any soil, from heavy clay to infertile sand. It 
tolerates salt, making it good for seaside and heavily-salted roadside. Its 
leaves and berries are aromatic. The gray, waxy berries (used in bayberry 
candles) are attractive in winter, and they provide food for birds. Bayberry 
has fine-textured foliage and an interesting branch structure. 6-10'.UConn 
Plant Database. <br>
&nbsp; <br>
<b>Rosebay, Great Laurel (Rhododendron maximum)
</b> <br>
moist soil zones 4-9 <br>
 With large clusters of pink or lavender 
flowers, rosebay is one of our showiest native shrubs. The large, oval leaves 
are evergreen. The twisty branches provide another ornamental feature. Rosebay 
dislikes hot, dry locations; it does best in morning sun and afternoon shade. 
6-15'.UConn Plant Database. <br>
&nbsp; <br>
<b>Pinxterbloom azalea 
(Rhododendron periclymenoides, syn. Rhododendron nudiflorum)</b> <br>
dry to 
moist soil zones 4-9 <br>
 In spring, the pinxterbloom azalea puts out fragrant 
flowers in pink, lavender, or white. The trumpet-shaped flowers have long 
stamens, giving them a festive look. Pinxterbloom is a tolerant shrub -- unlike 
most members of the Rhododendron genus, it will grow in sandy, rocky, or dry 
soil. Typically 4-6'. UConn Plant Database. <br>
&nbsp; <br>
<b>Swamp azalea 
(Rhododendron viscosum)</b> <br>
moist to wet soil zones 4-9 <br>
 In summer, 
the swamp azalea has white flowers with a delightful, spicy fragrance. The 
flowers attract hummingbirds. True to its name, swamp azalea enjoys a soggy 
spot -- probably the only azalea that does. 3-7' tall. <br>
<br>
<b>Fragrant 
Sumac (Rhus aromatica)</b> <br>
dry to average zones 4-9 <br>
 Fragrant sumac 
thrives in poor soil and hot, dry locations. It spreads by suckers and by 
stolons, so it can form a large colony. These traits make it an excellent 
choice for preventing erosion on steep banks. The leaves are aromatic; they 
turn a good red in fall. 3-6' tall. UConn Plant Database. <br>
&nbsp; <br>
<b>
Highbush blueberry (Vaccinium corymbosum)</b> <br>
average to moist zones 3-8 
<br>  Highbush blueberry is used in commercial blueberry farming. It's a good 
addition to the yard, and not just for its delicious fruit. In early summer, it 
has urn-shaped flowers in pale pink or white. In fall, its foliage presents a 
range of colors, from yellow to red to burgundy. During the growing season, its 
dense, rounded shape and fine-textured foliage are attractive; in winter its 
rusty red or yellow-green bark becomes prominent. 6-10' tall. UConn Plant 
Database. <br>
&nbsp; <br>
<b>American highbush cranberry (Viburnum trilobum, 
syn. Viburnum opulus var. americanum)</b> <br>
average to wet zones 2-7 <br>
 
American highbush cranberry is a very easy-to-grow shrub that is decorative for 
most of the year. In late spring, it has flat clusters of white flowers. In 
late summer, the red berries appear; they can persist through the winter. The 
berries are edible to birds and humans -- they make good preserves. The fall 
foliage is yellow, red, or red-purple. American highbush cranberry ought to be 
more widely planted; it is both prettier and more adaptable than the commoner 
European highbush cranberry (Viburnum opulus var. opulus). 8-12' tall. All of 
Connecticut's native Viburnums are good landscape shrubs: mapleleaf viburnum 
(Viburnum acerifolium), hobblebush (V. alnifolium), nannyberry (V. lentago), 
possum haw (V. nudum), black haw (V. prunifolium), arrowwood (V. dentatum), and 
downy arrowwood (V. rafinesquianum).UConn Plant Database. <br>

relevant page.
<p> </p> <b>Red maple (Acer rubrum)</b> <br>
dry to wet zones 4-9 <br>
 Red 
maple makes a beautiful shade tree or street tree. This maple has red flowers 
in early spring, and brilliant, clear red foliage in fall. The silvery bark is 
handsome year-round. Red maple is a fairly fast-growing tree. 40-70' tall. 
UConn Plant Database. <br>
&nbsp; <br>
<b>Downy servicebery, downy juneberry 
(Amelanchier arborea)</b> <br>
dry to moist zones 4-9 <br>
 Downy serviceberry 
is a graceful small tree or large shrub. It has clusters white flowers in 
spring. Its edible fruits taste a bit like blueberries; they are loved by 
birds. Beautiful fall foliage in shades of yellow, orange, and red. The 
slender, curving trunks with light-gray bark are attractive in winter. 20-25' 
tall. UConn Plant Database. <br>
&nbsp; <br>
<b>River birch, black birch 
(Betula nigra)</b> <br>
average to wet zones 4-9 <br>
 River birch is an 
excellent large landscape tree. The bark ranges from tan to cinnamon brown in 
color; its habit of peeling in sheets is attractive. Like many other birches, 
river birch often has several trunks, forming a handsome clump. Unlike the more 
commonly-planted white birch, river birch is seldom troubled by insect pests, 
and it tolerates summer heat well. 40-70'.UConn Plant Database. <br>
&nbsp; <br>
<b>American hornbeam, ironwood (Carpinus caroliniana)</b> <br>
average to wet 
zones 3-9 <br>
 American hornbeam is a pleasing small tree, with attractive 
blue-green foliage and good fall color. The trunk has subtle ripples, as if 
there were muscles bulging beneath the bark; the tree is sometimes called 
musclewood. In the wild, it usually grows along rivers or streams, and it will 
tolerate occasional flooding. Birds enjoy the fruit. 20-40' tall. UConn Plant 
Database. <br>
&nbsp; <br>
<b>Hackberry, sugarberry (Celtis occidentalis)</b> 
<br> very dry to moist zones 4-9 <br>
 Hackberry is a fast-growing shade tree 
that is exceptionally tolerant of adverse conditions. It withstands soggy soil 
or extreme drought, clay or sandy soil, urban pollution, and strong wind. Its 
roots grow deep; the absence of shallow roots mean it can be planted next to 
walkways and not cause heaving. The edible berries are said to taste like 
dates; they are relished by birds. 40-60'. UConn Plant Database. <br>
&nbsp; 
<br> <b>Redbud (Cercis canadensis)</b> <br>
average to moist zones 4-9 <br>
 
Redbud is valued for its showy, deep-pink flowers, which appear in spring 
before the tree leafs out. It blooms heavily from a young age. The broad, 
heart-shaped leaves are also pleasing. Redbud makes an effective companion for 
flowering dogwood, as it blooms at the same time and enjoys the same growing 
conditions. (Redbud is, however, somewhat more adaptable than dogwood to 
less-than-perfect conditions.) 25-30'. UConn Plant Database. <br>
&nbsp; <br>

<b>Pagoda dogwood, green osier (Cornus alternifolia)</b> <br>
moist zones 5-9 
<br>  The pagoda dogwood gets its name from its horizontal branching habit, 
which gives the tree a tiered look. This distinctive form makes the pagoda 
dogwood a good specimen tree; it can also add variety to mixed plantings or 
woods. Its flowers aren't as showy as those of the flowering dogwood, but the 
fruit is ornamental. As it ripens, the fruit turns first red then blue-black; 
the stalks are coral-colored. The fruit is popular with birds (which 
unfortunately means that it doesn't stay on the tree very long). Pagoda dogwood 
has fairly nice fall foliage in red to purple-red. The tree does not like hot 
dry spots, though it tolerates full sun if the soil is reliably moist. Mulching 
will help keep the soil cool and moist. 15-25'. UConn Plant Database. <br>

&nbsp; <br>
<b>Flowering dogwood (Cornus florida)</b> <br>
moist zones 5-8 <br>

 Flowering dogwood is an exceptionally ornamental tree year-round. In spring, 
it has large white flowers with four distinctively notched, petal-like bracts. 
The leaves are a nice dark green in summer, and a beautiful red to purple in 
fall; flowering dogwood holds its fall color for a long period. The shiny red 
fruit is also attractive, and it provides important winter food for wildlife. 
In winter, the tree shows off its lovely structure -- low, gracefully curved 
branches with light-colored bark. While flowering dogwood is susceptible to 
anthracnose and borers, proper growing conditions minimize the risk. Wet leaves 
are more vulnerable to anthracnose infection, so a sunny location with good air 
circulation is best. Consistently moist soil is important, especially for trees 
growing in full sun. (Mulching the soil is an easy way to maintain soil 
moisture.) Slightly acidic soil high in organic matter is preferred. Read more 
about anthracnose and other plant diseases inCornell University factsheets.  
20-30'.UConn Plant Database. <br>
&nbsp; <br>
<b>Sour gum, black gum (Nyssa 
sylvatica)</b> <br>
average to wet zones 5-9 <br>
 Sour gum is one of the very 
best trees for fall color. The show starts as early as mid-summer, with a few 
leaves turning orange or red. By fall the whole tree is a blazing mix of warm 
colors, and the color lasts a long time. In summer the foliage is glossy dark 
green. Sour gum grows fastest if it has fertile, slightly acidic, moist soil, 
but it will grow in anything except alkaline or extremely dry soil. Salt 
tolerant. 40-60'. UConn Plant Database. <br>
&nbsp; <br>
<b>American hop 
hornbeam, ironwood (Ostrya virginiana)</b> <br>
dry to moist zones 4-9 <br>
 
American hop hornbeam is a graceful medium-small tree. Mature trees have a 
pleasing rounded shape, with drooping lower branches. The name comes from the 
decorative, papery fruits, which resemble hops. Hophornbeam is an excellent 
choice for a dry woodland; once established, it is highly drought-tolerant. 
30-40'. UConn Plant Database. <br>
&nbsp; <br>
<b>Fire cherry, pin cherry 
(Prunus pensylvanica)</b> <br>
dry to moist zones 4-8 <br>
 Fire cherry is one 
of the first trees to appear after a forest fire, as its seeds resist burning 
and the tree tolerates the harsh, exposed conditions of burned land. In the 
landscape, it does well in sunny locations, where it will tolerate poor soil, 
dry soil, and strong winds. It's a fast-growing small tree with delicate white 
flowers in spring, followed by bright red fruit. The smooth, red-brown bark is 
appealing. Fall color is yellow to red. 25-35'. <br>
&nbsp; <br>
<b>White oak 
(Quercus alba)</b> <br>
dry to average zones 4-9 <br>
 Connecticut's state 
tree, white oak is a beautiful and majestic tree. White oaks planted in the 
open develop a broad crown, with many branches nearly horizontal. The foliage 
is dark red to reddish-purple for a long period in fall. White oaks can live 
for centuries; planting one is an easy way to earn the gratitude of future 
generations. Oaks in general are excellent trees for wildlife -- they attract 
not just squirrels, but also foxes, deer, porcupines, rabbits, and many species 
of birds. 50-80'. UConn Plant Database. <br>
&nbsp; <br>
<b>Staghorn sumac 
(Rhus typhina)</b> <br>
dry to average zones 4-8 <br>
 Staghorn sumac is a 
resilient small tree with many ornamental attributes. Its large compound leaves 
bring a tropical effect to the landscape. Fall color is a brilliant red, almost 
pink. Female plants have attractive clusters of fuzzy, dark red berries through 
fall and winter. Spreading by root suckers allows staghorn sumac to form a 
pleasing clump; cut off wayward shoots to maintain the desired clump size. 
Staghorn sumac is widely planted as an ornamental in Europe; it should be 
better appreciated in its homeland. It tolerates heat, drought, pollution, and 
very infertile soil -- virtually anything except soggy soil. 15-25'. UConn 
Plant Database. <br>
