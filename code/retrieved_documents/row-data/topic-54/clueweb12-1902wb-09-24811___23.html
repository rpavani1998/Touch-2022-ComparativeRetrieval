<p><b><i>Chokeberry: (Aronia melanocarpa &lsquo;Autumn Magic&rsquo;)&nbsp;<b>
Full sun to part shade&nbsp;Hardy in zones 3-7&nbsp;Flowering shrub.&nbsp;</b>A 
large shrub with glossy green foliage that turns fire red in autumn.&nbsp;White 
scented flower clusters in spring are followed by large edible berries that 
mature over summer.&nbsp;Upright growth reaches 5 feet and 3-5 feet 
wide.&nbsp;Chokeberry prefers full sun for best flowering and is very drought 
tolerant.&nbsp;Adapts easily to a variety of soils as long as it is well

<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><b><i>Daphne:</i></b> <b>Full sun to part shade&nbsp;Hardy in zones 4-7
&nbsp;Flowering shrub.&nbsp;</b>The striking <b>'Carol Mackie'</b> is easy to 
grow in ordinary soil up to zone 4. The dense rounded flowering shrub has 
unusually variegated leaves, with a golden yellow band around each edge.&nbsp; 
Abundant star shaped pale pink flowers in May and June are richly 
fragrant.&nbsp;Reblooming may occur, and tiny red fruits replace the blooms in 
fall.&nbsp;&lsquo;Carol Mackie&rsquo; Daphne requires well drained soil and 
prefers neutral to slightly acidic soil.&nbsp;Preferring dry soil conditions, 
Daphne is drought resistant.&nbsp;Grows slowly but reliably, reaching a rounded 
3&rsquo; high and ups to 4 - 6&rsquo; wide.&nbsp;Evergreen in mild 
regions.&nbsp;Deer resistance is a bonus.&nbsp;Daphne requires little or no
pruning and little or no fertilizer.&nbsp;Hardiness is generally listed as up 
to zone 5, but it has proven to be hardy in zone 4, down to 30 degrees below 
F.&nbsp;Hard pruning after a killing frost is suggested where snow cover is 
heavy to prevent branch damage by heavy wet snows.&nbsp;The plant usually 
rebounds quickly the following spring.&nbsp;Note that Daphne foliage and fruit 
are poisonous if ingested.&nbsp;Daphne is also known to inexplicably die, for 
no apparent reason.&nbsp;Do avoid disturbing the roots and do not attempt 
transplant.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><b>'Briggs Moonlight' </b>foliage is a reverse variegated version of the 
'Carol Mackie'. The leaves have creamy yellow centers with green 
margins.&nbsp;Pink buds open to pale pink to white blooms that attract 
butterflies.&nbsp;The compact, rounded shrub&nbsp;grows only to a 2 foot mound. 
Prefers full sun, neutral sandy soil, minimal watering, and will benefit from 
winter protection even in zone 4.&nbsp;Daphne is generally hardy to zone 
4.&nbsp; Soil must be well drained.&nbsp;Should not be pruned unless necessary 
or transplanted.&nbsp;Like other Daphnes, &lsquo;Briggs Moonlight&rsquo; may 
die for no apparent reason.&nbsp;Many gardeners are so enamored by the gorgeous 
foliage, that they will plant it over and over nonetheless.&nbsp;All parts of 
the plant are poisonous.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&lsquo;<b>Aureomarginata&rsquo; </b>is a bit more adaptable and easier to 
grow than other daphnes.&nbsp;It is the most aromatic.&nbsp;In early spring, 
purple buds open to pale pink to white blooms&nbsp;in April and May.&nbsp;Long 
narrow leaves are dark green with bright gold margins.&nbsp;A rounded form is 
well branched and upright and grows fairly quickly to 4 or 5 feet tall and 
spreads to 5 or 6&rsquo; wide.&nbsp;Plant in a cool moist location with rich, 
well drained soil.&nbsp;Often referred to as winter daphne, gardners in mild 
regions have found success with this daphne when grown in light to part 
shade.&nbsp;It is not fond of hot, midday 
sun.&nbsp;&lsquo;Aureomarginata&rsquo; prefers light shade and is only hardy to 
zone 7, as are several other varieties of Daphne.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><b>&lsquo;Retusa&rsquo;</b>&nbsp;grows densely mounded reaching only 2 to 3 
feet high and wide.&nbsp;The blooms are fragrant borne in dense clusters of 
pink with pink tinged centers.&nbsp;Foliage is leathery and shiny dark 
green.&nbsp;This is a very easy to grow daphne requiring full sun to part shade 
and moist well drained soil.&nbsp;Bright red drupes attract birds.&nbsp;Hardy 
in zones 6 to 9.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><b>&lsquo;Lawrence Crocker&rsquo;</b> is a dense, compact shrub reaching 
only about 12&rdquo; tall and wide.&nbsp;Blooms are sweetly fragranced and 
vivid pink, blooming from spring through summer.&nbsp;Plant in sun to part 
shade in enriched moist soil, providing regular watering to ensure good 
health.&nbsp;Mulch year round to retain moisture and keep roots cool in 
summer.&nbsp;Thick leaves are textured bright green.&nbsp;This is an excellent 
daphne for rock gardens or the front of a shrub border or foundation 
planting.&nbsp;Although hardy to zone 6, &lsquo;Lawrence Crocker&rsquo; should 
be protected from harsh winter exposure.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><b><i>Dogwood:</i></b> <i>(Cornus) <b>Full sun to shade&nbsp;Hardy in zones 
2-8&nbsp;Flowering shrub.&nbsp;</b></i>A staple of the northern landscapes, 
there is a versatile variety of hardy shrub and tree form available for 
northern climates.<b><i>C.alba 'Elegantissima' </i>i</b>s probably the most 
common in the north as a property corner anchor or screen due to it's large 
size (up to 10 feet). This red twigged dogwood has variegated leaves, providing 
summer and winter interest and texture. It displays the best fall color in full 
sun, with shades of gold, apricot and rose, but will do well in part shade. 
Bright red bark in winter is a bright spot in the landscape. Also tolerates 
damp soil very well and is hardy to zone 2,</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><i>C. amomum <b>&lsquo;Silky Dogwood&rsquo;</b></i> is another large 
dogwood that is excellent for screening, windbreaks and stabilizing stream 
banks.&nbsp;For some reason it loves the Great Lake states, but doesn&rsquo;t 
do as well outside the area other than some areas of the southeast&nbsp;Dark 
green leaves with white flowers grows in an upright, rounded habit, reaching 
6-10 feet tall.&nbsp;&nbsp;It loves moist, poorly drained and slightly acidic 
soils.&nbsp;Branches that come in contact with the ground will root and form a 
thicket.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><i>C. sericia </i><b><i>&lsquo;Red Osier&rsquo;</i> </b>dogwoods are also 
hardy to zone 2, reaching 7-10 feet high and wide.&nbsp;You will find many<i>C. 
sericia</i> with many different names, including the <i>&lsquo;Red 
Osier&rsquo;, &lsquo;Red Twig&rsquo;, &lsquo;American&rsquo;, 
&lsquo;Western&rsquo;</i>and<i> &lsquo;Red Stem&rsquo;.&nbsp;</i>They are all 
nearly the same plant, perhaps with minor differences.&nbsp;Most of the 
&lsquo;Red Osiers&rsquo; are fast growing.&nbsp;&lsquo;Isanti&rsquo; has bright 
red winter stems, the most colorful of the<i>Red Osiers,</i> and is 5-7 feet 
tall.&nbsp;It is slow growing and dense with red twigs.&nbsp;Fruits heavily to 
attract birds.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><i>C. canadensis </i>'<b>Bunchberry, Dwarf Cornel'</b> is a creeping 
species, actually a subshrub that spreads by 
rhizomes.&nbsp;&lsquo;Bunchberry&rsquo; requires shade to be at its&rsquo; 
best, and prefers moist, well drained, acidic soil.&nbsp;Soil must be cool, 65 
degrees or less.&nbsp; It is only 2-8&rdquo; tall.&nbsp;White flowers in June 
or July are followed by edible berries.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><i>C. alternifoilia</i><b><i> </i>'Golden Shadows' </b>displays the 
graceful habit of a Pogoda, with lime green leaves edged in gold. &lsquo;Golden 
Shadows&rsquo; is a large enough shrub to be trimmed into an ornamental 
tree.&nbsp;Fragrant white flowers in June are followed by dark blue fruit.</p> 
<p>Most dogwoods do not like a lot of sun, plant in shade to part 
shade.&nbsp;Most are also quite tolerant of diverse conditions and are easy to 
grow with little care required.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><i>C. alba &lsquo;Elegantissima&rsquo;</i> <b>Silverleaf Dogwood </b>is 
very commonly grown in the North and Midwest because it is so hardy and 
adaptable.&nbsp;Lovely variegated foliage is green with creamy white 
edges.&nbsp;Red purple branches stand out against the snow in 
winter.&nbsp;Silverleaf will growwell in su n, pa rt sh ad e or shade and is 
hardy to zone 2.&nbsp;This is a large shrub, reaching easily 7 feet high and 5 
feet wide.&nbsp;Size is easily controlled by regular pruning</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><b><i>Elderberry:&nbsp;(Sambucus )&nbsp;European Elderberry are quite large 
shrubs, larger than our American nativeSambucus canadensis, that produce large 
flat cluster of flowers in spring, and large clusters of black berries in 
fall.&nbsp;In general, they like moist, well drained soils, but will tolerate 
both wet and dry, as well as alkaline soils.&nbsp;They will also tolerate windy 
sites.&nbsp;Elderberry may tend to sucker, and may need occasional pruning to 
hold a good form.&nbsp;Aphids problems are common, and occasionally may have 
trouble with borers, cankers and mildew.</i></b></p> 
<p><b><i>Sambucus nigra &lsquo;Eva&rsquo; (Black Lace Elderberry)</i>&nbsp;<b>
Full sun to part shade&nbsp;Hardy in zones 4-7&nbsp;Flowering shrub.&nbsp;</b>
&lsquo;Black Lace&rsquo; has deep dark purple foliage that is lacy and finely 
cut.&nbsp;The effect is a similarity to Japanese Maple. Leaves hold their color 
well even in the extreme heat of the southern zones.&nbsp;Pink buds open to 
lacy white blooms May through June.&nbsp;Mature size is 8-10 feet tall and 
wide, or larger in ideal conditions.&nbsp;Makes an excellent specimen plant, 
and contrasts pale or bright foliage beautifully.</b></p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><b><i>Sambucus &lsquo;Sutherland Gold&rsquo; </i>Full Sun&nbsp;Hardy in 
zones 3-8&nbsp;Flowering shrub.&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;Foliage is bright golden, with 
deeply cut leaves with a fern-like effect.&nbsp;New growth starts out bright 
coppery red, then to golden yellow, and finally mellows to a lime 
green.&nbsp;Masses of creamy white star shaped flowers develop into red fruit 
clusters that attract birds.&nbsp;This tough plant does well on a southern 
exposure, standing up well to all day sun and heat.&nbsp;But it does enjoy some 
sun protection to avoid leaf scorch in more southern zones.&nbsp;Deer 
Resistant.&nbsp;Mature size is 12 feet high and 8 feet wide.&nbsp;Growth can be 
restrained with regular pruning.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><b><i>Forsythia: Full sun&nbsp;Hardy in zones 4-8 Flowering shrub.&nbsp;</i>
</b>This shrub is best known for its' showy brilliant yellow flowers in early 
spring. They need some space, as they can grow quite large, with long arching 
branches sprawling wildly.&nbsp;They will prune well to keep in check, but 
remember never to prune until after they have flowered.&nbsp;Prune out the 
oldest wood down to the ground.&nbsp;Forsythia blooms on old wood, so 
don&rsquo;t remove too many branches each pruning to preserve blooms.&nbsp;Will 
tolerate severe renewal pruning if necessary.&nbsp;Forsythia thrives in 
ordinary soil in full sun or light shade.&nbsp;Will tolerate alkaline soils, 
and prefers moist, well drained.&nbsp; The hybrids are generally hardy to zone 
3 or 4.&nbsp;'Spring Glory'<i>(F. x intermedia)</i> explodes in pale yellow 
blooms in April, reaching 6-8 feet tall and wide, and is<b>hardy to zone 3.</b> 
Form is upright with slightly arching branches.&nbsp;&lsquo;Spring Glory&rsquo; 
is rust resistant.&nbsp;'Gold Tide' is a dwarf that only reaches 2-3 feet, 
spreading to 4 feet - excellent for a slope or trailing over a wall. It is 
compact with a ground hugging habit and is excellent for mass 
plantings.&nbsp;Yellow blooms appear in early spring.&nbsp;It is not tolerant 
of dry soils and needs good snow cover for consistent spring bloom.&nbsp;<b>
Hardy to zone 4</b>. &lsquo;Northern Gold&rsquo; was developed in Canada and is 
truly northern hardy.&nbsp;Flower buds are cold hardy andreaches 6-8 feet tall 
and wide, with an upright habit.&nbsp;<b>Hardy to zone 4, hardy in zone 3 other 
than perhaps the most severe winters, and will hold up well even in zone 2 with 
shelter and adequate snow cover.</b>&nbsp;&lsquo;Kumson&rsquo; is a unique 
Korean cultivar that has interesting dark green leaves with silver veins, 
providing season long interest unusual to forsythia.&nbsp;The leaf patterns are 
most pronounced on new growth, so frequent pruning will encourage more foliage 
interest but reduce the flowering.&nbsp;Yellow flowers appear in early spring 
like all cultivars.&nbsp;Will do fine in sun, but does best in shade to part 
shade.&nbsp;It grows well in most soils and is drought resistant once 
established.&nbsp;&lsquo;Kumson&rsquo; reaches 8-10&rsquo; tall and 7-9&rsquo; 
wide, and is<b>hardy to zone 4.</b>&nbsp;Forsythia <i>ovata</i> varieties are 
hardy to zone 5.<i>Ovata </i>is known as the Early Forsythia, and grows to 4-6 
feet.&nbsp;For best flowering for all forsythia,&nbsp;severely prune old wood 
immediately after bloom.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><b><i>Fothergilla:&nbsp;(Fothergilla gardenia)&nbsp;&lsquo;Dwarf&rsquo;<b>
Full to part sun&nbsp;Flowering shrub&nbsp;Hardy in zones 5-8, perhaps 4.</b>
&nbsp;This is a small dense shrub with unusual 1-2&rdquo; bottlebrush flowers 
that are creamy white and fragrant.&nbsp;The multi-stemmed suckering bush is 
compact and rounded to upright oval.&nbsp;Foliage is blue green with pale green 
undersides.&nbsp;Fall color is inconsistent but generally excellent, ranging 
from yellow-orange to red-purple.&nbsp;Fothergilla prefers an acidic, cool, 
well drained soil.&nbsp;Mature size is 2-3&rsquo; high and wide.</i></b></p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><b><i>(Fothergilla major) &lsquo;Mount Airy&rsquo;</i> is a much larger 
shrub, reaching 5-6&rsquo; high and 4-5&rsquo; wide, but is know to grow even 
larger in good conditions.&nbsp;&lsquo;Mount Airy&rsquo; prefers<b>full sun</b>
, it will tolerate light shade but will not flower as prolifically or produce 
good fall color.&nbsp;White bottlebrush blooms in May are somewhat 
fragrant.&nbsp;Foliage is dark green and underside is a grayed white.&nbsp;Fall 
color is a superior orange to red.&nbsp;&lsquo;Mount Airy&rsquo; is most 
flattered by a dark evergreen background.&nbsp;Wonderful alternative to 
smokebush, used as a foundation planting, shrub border or in open 
&ldquo;natural&rdquo; areas.</b></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><b><i>Harry Lauder&rsquo;s Walking Stick:&nbsp;(Corylus avellana contorta)
&nbsp;</i>Full sun to part shade&nbsp;Hardy in zones 4-8.<i> If you are looking 
for something REALLY unusual, this is it.&nbsp;Unbelievably contorted branches 
that go way beyond the term winter interest.&nbsp;Striking accent especially in 
a contemporary or oriental landscape.&nbsp;&nbsp;Spring produces showy yellow 
2-3 inch catkins, and inconspicuous red flowers on female plants.&nbsp;Rarely 
produces a fruit, but may produce nuts.&nbsp;Cut branches are a great accent to 
your fresh, or silk arrangements.&nbsp;Does well in sun or shade, southern 
exposure may be best, in average well drained soil.&nbsp;Will benefit from 
protection from the hottest afternoon sun.&nbsp;&nbsp;Can reach 8-10 feet 
tall.&nbsp;Thinning will increase the summer interest by exposing more of the 
contorted branches.&nbsp;This is the only necessary pruning other than removing 
suckers if you want to retain the natural beauty of this shrub.&nbsp;Dry the 
thinned out branches to use in floral arrangements.&nbsp;Although the plant 
seems to be pretty hardy, do try to buy own root in case of die back. They are 
generally grafted toCorylus colurna, and tends to grow suckers which must be 
pruned out.&nbsp;Also known as Corkscrew Hazel and Contorted Filbert.</i></b>

<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><b><i>Heavenly Bamboo (nandina domestica)&nbsp;<b>Full sun to part 
shade&nbsp;Hardy in zones 6-9&nbsp;Flowering shrub.</b>&nbsp;Although 
completely unrelated to bamboo, the fine lacy foliage growing on cane like 
stalks does resemble bamboo.&nbsp;&lsquo;Nandina&rsquo; is not fully hardy in 
the north and midwest, as the canes will die back at around -10 degrees, but 
does grow back vigorously each spring.&nbsp;The interesting and colorful 
foliage provides wonderful color and texture to the garden, with the color 
becoming most intense in full sun.&nbsp;More southern climates should plant in 
late day shade to give it some protection from the most intense heat.&nbsp;Also 
protect from harsh winds.&nbsp;This shrub is very tough and adaptable but does 
prefer a rich acid soil and moist conditions.&nbsp;Short periods of drought can 
be tolerated.&nbsp;&nbsp;Foliage emerges in spring bronzey red followed by 6 - 
12 inch panicles of creamy flowers.&nbsp;The foliage matures to blue green and 
finally fades to green.&nbsp;If left unpruned, berry clusters develop and ripen 
to bright red.&nbsp;Foliage color changes to pink and red in autumn, ending in 
a bright red with the red berries.&nbsp;The shrub can become quite large in 
warmer climates reaching up to 8 feet and 4 - 6 feet wide.&nbsp;Where winter 
causes die back the shrub remains smaller.&nbsp;Size is easily controlled by 
pruning.&nbsp;Left unpruned, Heavenly Bamboo will create a lovely screen or 
hedge, attracting bees with it&rsquo;s blooms and birds with its&rsquo; 
berries.&nbsp; Prune in spring to control size and increase density.&nbsp;Renew 
by pruning the oldest branches and weak growth at ground level.</i></b></p> 
<p><i></i>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><i><b>Hibiscus: </b>(syriacus)&nbsp;</i><b>Full sun to part shade&nbsp;
Hardy in zones 5-8&nbsp;Flowering shrub.&nbsp;</b>Here, referring to the woody 
shrub, is only hardy to zone 5. Also known as the Rose of Sharon, 'Sanchoyo' 
with deep rose-pink double flowers, or 'Blue Bird', with huge single blue 
blooms, are absolutely stunning and bloom all summer. They are both a tall, 
narrow shrub (7-12 feet high and 3-5 feet wide) that is hard to find for 
filling corners or landscaping with all summer blooms.&nbsp;There are several 
cultivars including &lsquo;Diana&rsquo; with pure white flowers; &lsquo;Jeanne 
d&rsquo;Arc&rsquo; with double white flowers; and &lsquo;Lucy&rsquo; with 
double red flowers. None are successful in zone 4 without protection.&nbsp;<i>
Hibiscus</i>and<i> &lsquo;Rose of Sharon&rsquo;</i> should be heavily mulched 
in zone 5 to ensure the roots are protected.&nbsp;In regions that drop below 
-38 degrees, further protection is advised, treating the plant almost like a 
hybrid tea rose.&nbsp;Mound several inches of soil at the base of the plant, 
and mulch heavily.&nbsp;Hibiscus prefers moist well drained soils and is 
tolerant of alkaline soil.&nbsp;Annual pruning in early spring will improve 
flowering.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><b><i>Honeysuckle Bush, dwarf:&nbsp;(Diervilla Lonicera)&nbsp;</i>Full sun 
tofull shade&nbsp;Hardy in zones 3-7&nbsp;Flowering shrub.&nbsp;</b>This is one 
tough little shrub.&nbsp;Excellent for difficult sites such as slopes, or 
naturalizing and mass planting, or along a wood&rsquo;s edge.&nbsp;Foliage is 
bronze-green.&nbsp;Small yellow flowers are produced in late spring.&nbsp;Bees, 
butterflies and birds are attracted to the blooms.&nbsp;Tolerates 
shade.&nbsp;Fall foliage is red.&nbsp;Grows to 4&rsquo; high and wide.<i>
Diervilla sessillifolia &lsquo;Butterfly&rsquo;</i>&nbsp;is similar, with a 
compact growth habit.&nbsp;Bright green foliage and early summer yellow 
flowers, prefers full to part sun.&nbsp;Will adapt to dry shade.&nbsp;Reaches 
about 3-5&rsquo; high and wide, and is<b>hardy in zones 4-7.</b>&nbsp; <i>
Lonicera &lsquo;Honeyrose&rsquo;</i> was introduced by the University of 
Minnesota, a testament to its&rsquo; hardiness, and has rosy red flowers in 
early tomidsummer.&nbsp;Foliage is deep blue-green and is resistant to 
Honeysuckle witches broom aphid.&nbsp;It makes a wonderful informal hedge or 
screen.&nbsp;Good for difficult sites and windbreaks.&nbsp;Grows well in full 
sun to part shade, reaching 10&rsquo; high and 8-10&rsquo; wide.&nbsp;<b>Hardy 
in zones 4-7.</b></p>

<p><b><i>Hydrangea: Full sun to part shade&nbsp;Hardiness 
varies&nbsp;Flowering shrub.&nbsp;</i></b>It seems not that long ago that 
hydrangea were only found in grandma's garden. With so many new varieties, they 
are widely used in foundation plantings, landscaping and gardens. They are 
wonderful singly or in masses, most doing best in shade to part-shade.&nbsp;But 
not dense shade, if the grass won&rsquo;t grow, neither will your 
hydrangea.&nbsp;If your hydrangea should fail to flower, it could be due to 
winter kill of the buds, pruning at the wrong time, too much shade for the 
variety or excess nitrogen.</p> 
<p>'Annabelle' <i>(Hydrangea arborescens)</i> produces enormous white 
&quot;snowballs&quot; in summer, keeping a mounded shape at about 4 feet. It 
does best in part to full shade, but will tolerate full sun if it receives 
enough water.&nbsp;Unlike the macrophylla hydrangeas, arborescens will bloom 
every year even after winter dieback (which will happen in the north zones) or 
severe pruning, because &lsquo;Annabelle&rsquo; blooms on new wood. Normally, 
prune only sparingly to encourage stems to grow sturdy enough to support the 
heavy blooms and to encourage more, but just slightly smaller 
blooms.&nbsp;Grows to 4-5&rsquo; high and 3-5&rsquo; wide.<b>Hardy to zone 3, 
perhaps even 2</b>, but will often die back to the ground.&nbsp;This does not 
affect flowering since it flowers on new growth. An occassional 
&lsquo;Annabelle&rsquo; is not a good bloomer, so buy yours in bloom to make 
sure you get one that is not skimpy.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;<i>Macrophyllas</i> are the &ldquo;mophead&rdquo; hydrangeas.&nbsp;<i>
Hydrangea macrophylla</i>include the &ldquo;colored flower&rdquo; cultivars; 
Endless Summer and Nikko Blue.&nbsp;They are really only hardy to zone 6 and 
typically may not flower in zone 5.&nbsp;Varieties that flower on old wood - 
since they often die back to the ground in zones 4 and 5, they will not 
flower.&nbsp;Zone 5 hardy<i>Hydrangea</i> should be heavily mulched to ensure 
the roots are protected.&nbsp;In regions that drop below -38 degrees, further 
protection is advised, treating the plant almost like a hybrid tea 
rose.&nbsp;Mound several inches of soil at the base of the plant, and mulch 
heavily may improve the chances of a successful bloom in spring.&nbsp;The 
hydrangea with blue and pink flower heads require close attention to soil pH to 
retain their color.&nbsp;If you do not have acid soil (pH of&nbsp;6 or less), 
it is easiest to control in a container with aluminum sulphate, which is 
commonly found in gardens centers for the colored hydrangeas.&nbsp;Mopheads 
struggle in sandy soils and dry conditions.&nbsp;Mopheads never need pruning 
other than to remove dead branches.&nbsp;They bloom in June or July on old 
wood, forming their flower buds just afterward in August or 
September.&nbsp;(&lsquo;Endless Summer&rsquo; is an exception, it will bloom on 
old AND new wood).&nbsp;Pruning of 1/3 or more of the branch length to reduce 
size should be done immediately after blooms fade to preserve next years&rsquo; 
bloom, but the shrub grows back so quickly that the pruning is nearly 
useless.&nbsp;Simply removing the dead flowerheads (deadheading) can be done at 
any time.&nbsp;Up to one third of the old stems may be removed to the ground to 
rejuvenate an old plant.</p> 
<p>&lsquo;<b>Blushing Bride&rsquo; </b><i>(Hydrangea macrophylia)</i> produces 
4-8&rsquo; flowers with dark green foliage.&nbsp;It is common to see a broad 
range of bloom colors on a single plant, from pink blush, to deep 
pink.&nbsp;Blooms open pure white and mature to blush pink or deep blue 
depending on soil pH.&nbsp;It blooms on old and new wood.&nbsp;Strong stems and 
branches keep the blooms upright, and perfect for cutting.&nbsp;Grows to 
3-6&rsquo; tall and wide.&nbsp;Does not like full sun.&nbsp;<b>Hardy in zones 
5-9.</b></p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><b>&lsquo;Endless Summer&rsquo; </b><i>(Hydrangea macrophylia 
&lsquo;Bailmer&rsquo;)&nbsp;</i>This showy mophead blooms on old and new wood, 
producing blooms even after winter dieback.&nbsp;However the plant has not been 
found to be highly reliable in zone 4.&nbsp;Complete dieback after a zone 4 
winter can take the better part of zone 4&rsquo;s short growing season to 
regrow.&nbsp;Blooms come so late that the first frost may be right around the 
corner.&nbsp;&nbsp;Try in a container to bring indoors for the winter, or in a 
very protected microclimate.&nbsp;In the south, &lsquo;Endless Summer&rsquo; 
will produce two full bloom periods.&nbsp;Flowers tend to pink but will turn 
blue in acid conditions (pH of 6 or less).&nbsp;Grows to 3&rsquo; high and 
wide.&nbsp;<b>Hardy in zones 4-9.</b></p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><b>&lsquo;Nikko Blue&rsquo; </b>will produce pink blooms in alkaline soil, 
blue blooms in acid soil (pH of 6 or less) in July and August.&nbsp;Aluminum 
sulphate added to the soil in late autumn or early spring will make the blooms 
bluer, lime will make them pink.&nbsp;&lsquo;Nikko Blue&rsquo; blooms on old 
wood.&nbsp;It prefers medium moisture, well drained soil in part shade.&nbsp;If 
grown in full sun it requires constant moisture.&nbsp;Reaches 4-6&rsquo; tall 
and wide.&nbsp;<b>Hardy in zones 6-9.</b></p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><i>Macrophylla normalis</i> are the &ldquo;Lacecap&rdquo; hydrangeas, and 
are grown and cared for exactly the same as the mopheads. They are not quite as 
showy, but can be quite graceful and magnificent in a more subtle way. Lacecaps 
never need pruning other than to remove dead branches.&nbsp;They bloom in June 
or July on old wood, forming their flower buds just afterward in August or 
September.&nbsp;Pruning of 1/3 or more of the branch lengths to reduce size 
should be done immediately after blooms fade to preserve next years&rsquo; 
bloom, but the shrub grows back so quickly that the pruning is nearly 
useless.&nbsp;Simply removing the dead flowerheads (deadheading) can be done at 
any time&nbsp;Up to one third of the old stems may be removed to the ground to 
rejuvenate an old plant.</p> 
<p>Hydrangea &lsquo;<b>Light O Day&rsquo; </b>is interesting when out of 
bloom, with bold variegated leaves.&nbsp;It is a more reliable bloomer among 
the variegated varieties.&nbsp;Inner blooms can be pink or blue, surrounded by 
white.&nbsp;It is a lacecap mutation of Endless Summer, but will not 
rebloom.&nbsp;For best bloom production, plant in lightn shade, dappled shade, 
or morning sun with afternoon shade.&nbsp;<b>Hardy in zones 5-9.</b></p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><b>&lsquo;Tokyo Delight&rsquo;</b> will produce pink blooms in alkaline 
soil, blue blooms in acid soil (pH of 6 or less) in July and August.&nbsp;Faded 
blooms begin to turn shades of burgundy in autumn.&nbsp;Blooms on old 
wood.&nbsp;Prefers part shade in moist, well drained soil.&nbsp;Grows to 
3-6&rsquo; high and wide.&nbsp;<b>Hardy in zones 6-9, perhaps in zone 5.</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&lsquo;<b>Mariesii Variegated&rsquo;</b>&nbsp;has cream edged foliage and 
is long blooming in early to midsummer.&nbsp;The cream variegation is not 
stable, and will sometimes revert to all green.&nbsp;Bluish white florets 
surround bright blue florets.&nbsp;Grows best in part shade in zones 8 and 9, 
full sun more north.&nbsp;Reaches 5&rsquo; high and wide, growing in a dome 
shape.&nbsp;Pruning should be done right after the blooms fade, as it sets new 
blooms immediately after flowering.&nbsp;Blooms best in zones 8 and 9, bloom 
buds may freeze off in colder zones.&nbsp;<b>Hardy in zones 5-9.</b></p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><i>Hydrangea quercifolia, &ldquo;</i>Oakleaf&rdquo;, are white blooming and 
are winter hardy further north than the<i>arborescens. </i>The leaves are 
shaped like oak leaves.&nbsp;It blooms best where summers are hot, but is hardy 
further north than the mopheads.&nbsp;They can survive in dry conditions and 
with little attention.&nbsp;They do not like wet feet and must have excellent 
drainage to avoid root rot.&nbsp;Oakleaf never need pruning other than to 
remove dead branches.&nbsp;They bloom in June or July on old wood, forming 
their flower buds just afterward in August or September.&nbsp;Pruning of 1/3 or 
more of the branch lengths to reduce size should be done immediately after 
blooms fade to preserve next years&rsquo; bloom, but the shrub grows back so 
quickly that the pruning is nearly useless.&nbsp;Simply removing the dead 
flowerheads (deadheading) can be done at any time&nbsp;Up to one third of the 
old stems may be removed to the ground to rejuvenate an old plant.</p> 
<p><b>&lsquo;Snow Queen&rsquo; </b>is considered one of the finer shrubs for 
the landscape and garden.&nbsp;Large dark green leathery leaves and 12 to 
15&rdquo; pure white upright panicles of blooms make a striking 
presentation.&nbsp;Foliage turns burgundy in fall.&nbsp;It is highly pest and 
disease resistant, and grows well in either full sun or part shade&nbsp;Planted 
5 feet apart, &lsquo;Snow Queen&rsquo; forms a wall of white 
blooms.&nbsp;Reaches 10-12&rsquo; high and wide.&nbsp;<b>Hardy in zones 5-8.</b>
</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The elegant '<b>Pee Wee' </b>produces 10&rdquo; elongated flower heads of 
white that turn pale pink by fall. &lsquo;Pee Wee&rsquo; is a 
dwarf&nbsp;&lsquo;Snow Queen&rsquo; which will do well in full sun to part 
shade. Leaves turn burgundy-brown in fall, beautiful with the dried flower 
heads. Grows to 4 feet high and 3 feet wide.&nbsp;<b>Hardy in zones 5-9</b>
&nbsp;&lsquo;Sikes Dwarf&rsquo; is similar, but will do quite well in mostly 
shade.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;<i>Paniculata</i> are the &ldquo;PeeGee&rdquo; hydrangeas. Panicle 
Hydrangeas<i>(Hydrangea paniculata)</i> is a much larger shrub, 10-15 feet high 
and wide, and produces pyramid shaped flowerheads that turn from white, to 
pinkish, finally to brown in fall.&nbsp;Panicle hydrangea bloom on the current 
year&rsquo;s growth, so they can be pruned in fall, winter or 
spring.&nbsp;However they do not need pruning every year.&nbsp;Prune out only 
crossing branches and as needed to achieve desired form.&nbsp;PeeGee hydrangeas 
need more sun than the mopheads, several hours a day.&nbsp;They are also hardy 
to zone 3.</p> 
<p>&lsquo;Grandiflora&rsquo; is the famous <b>&lsquo;PeeGee&rsquo;</b>
.&nbsp;It is an upright mounded shrub, but is also grown as a small ornamental 
tree. The pure white conical flowers appear in July and August, and they mature 
to pinky bronze in fall.&nbsp;The dried flowerheads are beautiful in 
arrangements.&nbsp;Grows to 8&rsquo; high and 10-15&rsquo; wide.&nbsp;Full sun 
to part shade.&nbsp;<b>Hardy in zones 3-8.</b></p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><b>&lsquo;Limelight&rsquo; </b>is a new variety of hydrangea.&nbsp;It has 
unique bright lime green flowers that form a rounded 
panicle.&nbsp;&lsquo;Limelight&rsquo; blooms profusely on new wood in 
midsummer.&nbsp;Grows well in full sun to light shade, the lime color will be 
more pronounced in some shade.&nbsp;Particularily in more southern zones, will 
benefit from some light shade.&nbsp;Reaches 6-8&rsquo; tall and wide.&nbsp;<b>
Hardy in zones 3-8.</b></p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&lsquo;<b>Pink Diamond&rsquo; </b>develops huge 10 inch pink flower buds 
that open to white in late summer, then the pink intensifies as the blooms 
age.&nbsp;Hot weather and sun may diminish the bloom color.&nbsp;This hydrangea 
makes a stunning statement as a specimen plant.&nbsp; Does best in sun to part 
shade, and grows to 6-8&rsquo; high and wide.&nbsp;<b>Hardy in zones 3-8.</b>
</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><b>&lsquo;Tardiva&rsquo; </b>is similar to &lsquo;PeeGee&rsquo; but blooms 
later, in mid August, with larger flower panicles held on thick 
stems.&nbsp;With a loose, shrubby growing habit, &lsquo;Tardiva&rsquo; reaches 
6-8&rsquo; high and 8-10&rsquo; wide.&nbsp;Grows well in full sun to part 
shade.&nbsp;<b>Hardy in zones 3-8.</b></p>
