<strong>Banana Trees</strong> <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<strong>Arizona Bananas.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>This 
is a perfect example of how&nbsp;bananas DO grow in the desert!&nbsp; These 
Rajapuri bananas are&nbsp;the best for Arizona's hot winds,&nbsp;extreme heat 
and cold temps, however,&nbsp;each year these banana trees die back due to our 
short lived frost&nbsp;and&nbsp;return each Spring,&nbsp;even 
larger.&nbsp;&nbsp;These bananas pictured are planted&nbsp;on an East facing 
side of the property, where the morning and early afternoon sun kisses 
them.&nbsp; They feed off the nearby pond&nbsp;which contribute to the their 
success.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, they really do produce fruit! <br>
<br>

<p>Alright, everybody knows what a banana is.&nbsp;But here's some info you 
might find interesting!&nbsp;The banana family, thought to have originated in 
Asia, but commonly found in South America, is a large paddle-shaped leafed 
plant with clusters of edible fruits. Zoned 8-10 outdoors. They grow tall in 
full sun in these zones outdoors, yet they are ideal as houseplants with warm 
bright light year round.</p> 
<p>Bananas are small to large herbaceous (soft leaved) tree-like plants with 
leaves held at the top of what appears to be a trunk, but what is actually a 
tightly woven packed bunch of leaf sheaths and leaf stalks that emerge from an 
underground stem called a raceme. A banana starts as a bulb (or corm. That's 
right, C-O-R-M....Not Corn). Roots grow from the lower surface of the corm and 
the banana leaves form from the top surface of the bulb's stem called a 
raceme.&nbsp; You can start these plants&nbsp;from seeds, but it is a little 
more difficult and much more time consuming to do.&nbsp;Many seeds can take 6 
to 8 months to show growth or healthy germination, and&nbsp;most seeds must be 
scored before&nbsp;this&nbsp;can be attempted.&nbsp;There is no guarantee on 
seeds, if you want a guaranteed plant, simply buy the &nbsp;plant.</p> <br>
<br>
<br> 
<p>Over a short period of time, beautiful paddle-shaped leaves expand out of 
this stalk or raceme. Over a longer period of time, a drooping, flowering stem 
emerges as a final structure which flowers and gives way to fruits, which 
develop in groups on this last stem. Each group is called a hand, and 
individual bananas in the hand are called fingers. Once your banana has 
fruited, you may cut it back to the top of the soil level; by the time your 
banana has fruited, your banana will have already sent up sucker plants from 
the corm, fruit, and then die back successively!<br>
<br>
<strong>Due to 
weather delays, there may be periodic delays on specific varieties of 
bananas.&nbsp; Thank you for your patience.</strong></p> <br>

<p><strong>Banana Plant Care</strong></p>
<p>When we ship your banana tree to you, we generally cut all of the leaves 
off because they will die off anyway when you replant it. The stump you get can 
range in size from about a foot to 3 feet tall. It will grow new leaves very 
quickly in warm and humid weather, much slower in colder climates. It is very 
exciting to get your first few leaves! Keep soil moist but not saturated. 
Fertilize with a mild fertilizer (13-5-13 is ideal) at every watering. You can 
use stronger fertilizers like Peter&rsquo;s, Schultz&rsquo;s, Miracle Grow, 
even Steer Manure and it generally will NOT harm the plant.<strong>A good rule 
of thumb is: if you get less than 1 leaf per week, you are not fertilizing 
enough!</strong>It&rsquo;s hard to burn a banana with fertilizers. Use 
organically rich soil, in warm to very warm and humid conditions. Protect from 
strong winds if planted outdoors. Bananas shriveled to the ground by cold will 
re-sprout from the underground corm when temperatures warm up. We now sell 
banana SEEDS for one variety. Enjoy growing your banana tree from just a seed. 
What a rewarding way to grow a plant, and at a fraction of the cost. Banana 
plants and banana seeds also make a marvelous and ingenious gift idea!</p>
<p><br>
A banana plant can grow from 5' to 35' in as little as one year 
depending on variety and growing environment. Of course a banana's growth will 
slow if temperatures drop into the 50's. Even though your banana may look like 
a dead stump in the ground in the Winter, do not remove it, unless you live in 
a part of the country where the ground freezes solid. Instead, we suggest that 
you purchase some burlap from any hardware store, and wrap the trunk of the 
tree down to the ground, only allowing the leaves to be exposed. Of course, do 
this before first frost appears. Leave the burlap on until all fear of frost is 
gone. In Arizona, we would wrap our trees just before Thanksgiving and unwrap 
around mid-March. You may want to refrain from too much water or fertilizer 
during these colder months. If you are in a colder region, you may just want to 
dig up your stump, including some surrounding soil and keep it in a warmer 
place out of the elements, like a garage, or basement, until warmer weather is 
near. Folks in the East may even want to consider planting the banana in a 
moveable pot with a saucer in the first place, keep it as a houseplant, and 
when it&rsquo;s warm and humid out, move the plant outside. Thank you for your 
purchase and enjoy!</p>
