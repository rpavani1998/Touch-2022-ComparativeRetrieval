<p>In Australia, the fruit picking season peaks during summer, between the 
months of December and May. Due to different weather patterns, regions such as 
Manjimup, Pemberton, and Bunbury in Western Australia hold their apple harvest 
a bit later between March and May.</p> 
<p>In general, becoming a fruit picker requires no experience and most farms 
and orchards are eager to hire physically fit persons, but be aware it is hard 
labour.Most fruit pickers start early in the morning and finish before the peak 
of the summer sunshine later in the afternoon. Therefore, being physically fit 
and having good stamina helps, and here are some other essentials:</p> 
<p> Sunglasses - the sun can be very bright <br>
 Gloves - protection from 
spikes, thorns<br>
 Sunscreen - protection from the sun<br>
 Hat - protrect 
your headl<br>
 Hardy boots/shoes - protection from snakes and bullants <br>
 
Big drink container - it's thirsty work<br>
<br>
 Payment depends on a number 
of issues, such as how good the harvest is, and what the particular fruit or 
produce is.For example, some land owners prefer to pay pickers by the hour 
(anything above $10 an hour is good), such as vineyards and grape growers, 
because they want the fruit to remain in pristine condition. Bruising is not an 
option.Most places, however, pay per bucket, bin or box filled rather than by 
the hour. </p> 
<p>There are many different fruits and vegetables grown in Australia (commonly 
referred to as just 'fruit' by farmers and pickers). They fall into two fruit 
picking categories:</p> <strong>Ground fruit</strong> Fruit grows on or under 
the ground. This type of picking can be back breaking as it involves continual 
bending over to pick the fruit. <br>
<strong>Tree fruit</strong> Fruit is 
picked from the branches of a tree or plant. Often involves the use of ladders 
to pick fruit or use of a mechanical boom to pick fruit. <br>
<br>

<p>The following table shows what fruits are ground or tree fruits:</p> 
<strong>Ground Fruit or vegetables</strong> Asparagus, Barley, Beans, Berries, 
Broccoli, Cabbage, Capsicums, Cauliflower, Cucumber, Corn, Cotton, Chillies, 
Egg plant, Grapes, Honeydew, Lettuce , Oats, Onions, Potatoes, Pumpkins, Rock 
melons, Strawberries, Sugarcane, Tobacco, Watermelons, Wheat, Wild flowers, 
Zucchinis <br>
<strong>Tree fruits</strong> Avocado, Apricots, Apples, Bananas, 
Cherries, Lemons, Macadamia nuts, Mandarins, Mangos, Nectarines, Oranges, 
Pears, Peaches, Plums, <br>
<br>

<p>There are various methods used to pick fruit by the farmers:</p> <strong>
Size picking</strong> The farmer is looking to pick a particular size of fruit. 
Usually, picking fruit by size is conducted at the start of the season. <br>

<strong>Colour picking</strong> Sometimes, a certain coloured fruit is required 
by retailers. e.g. green or red tomatoes or capsicums <br>
<strong>Strip picking
</strong> Usually involves removing all the fruit or vegetables from the plant. 
<br> <br>

<p><b>What are the Wages for Fruit Picking</b><br>
<br>
 The money that can be 
earned by a fruit picker depends on the energy and enthusiasm of the fruit 
picker. You will either be paid an hourly rate (wages) or paid for the amount 
of fruit you pick (contract work)</p> <strong>Wages</strong> You will be paid 
an hourly rate to pick fruit. Wages are based on the Australia Standard wage 
rate for casual farm workers <br>
<strong>Contract</strong> Based on the amount 
of fruit picked by individual pickers. Usually involves collecting fruit in 
'buckets' (or bins) and recording the number of buckets picked each day. You 
determine the hours worked based on the number of buckets you wish to pick. <br>
<br> 
<p>If you are a good picker, contract work is usually the best way to make a 
good casual wage !</p>
