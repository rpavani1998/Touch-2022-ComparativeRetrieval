<p> Bio</p> We often think about the Full Moon as having an effect on us. This 
is obvious as we can see its influence on the tides, which are higher. We can 
also feel its effect on us . When I was a teacher, children were always more 
hyper around the Full Moon. Even my pets seem to have been more needy at this 
time of the month; and of course we know that some Police Forces have admitted 
to having more officers on duty at the time of the Full Moon because 
statistically they can see that there are more incidents aroud this time.<br>

<br> However, the Moon is linked with the earth all the time, so its energy 
does affect us all the time. Since having an allotment, I have developed an 
interest in biodynamics. This is a way of gardening that takes into account the 
place of the Moon when doing different tasks in the garden. It also involves 
caring for the soil with the preparation of natural feed and ways of 
controlling pests. Many of you interested in organic gardening will be familiar 
with some of the principles placing emphasis on the health of the soil. But 
biodynamic preparations also have some links with homeopathic principles.<br>

<br> In addition to my usual blog about Astrological events, on this page I am 
writing about my experiences as a biodynamic gardener in a special blog. I am 
also providing a gardening calendar each week so that you can plan your 
gardening week. Happy Gardening!!!<br>

<br>
 The Moon is 
in Scorpio and this is a water sign. So I'm watering my houseplants but I'm 
also checking the garden. Before the snow, I noticed that some of my pots 
outdoors were dry. It's easy to think that the garden doesn't need watering in 
the winter but if you have pots with plants against walls, they may not be 
getting the rain. The snow has now melted, but I'm going to check whether 
anything is still dry.<br>
<br>
 12/02/12<br>
<br>
 Snow, and another week of 
my intensitve Hypnotherapy course have kept me off the allotment. I'm looking 
forward to being back there again tomorrow. At least before freezing 
temperatures return. In the meantime, there are seeds to order- so today is a 
day for reading seed catalogues. It's like being in a sweet shop!<br>
<br>
 
3/02/12<br>
<br>
 A waxing Moon in Gemini means that it's a flower day, so this 
afternoon was all about cauliflowers. Back in the autumn I sowed a batch of 
seed. I've been meaning to prick them out and put them in more comfortable 
quarters- that's bigger pots, since December. But everytime the Moon was right, 
I was too busy and ran out of time. Happily, today Moon and time coincided so I 
spent a good part of the afternoon looking after them. It's a very cold day and 
a job like this doesn't involve a lot of movement. Being outdoors was not an 
option. For once I worked in comfort on a portable table in my hallway. It was 
like having a potting shed, but warmer. A very pleasant hour was spent and 
they're now comfortably sheltered in my mini-greenhouse.<br>
<br>
 31/01/12<br>

<br> One of the wonderful things about allotments is the fact that there's 
always someone on hand who can tell you what you need to know.<br>
<br>
 Being 
rather a novice compost maker, yesterday with the Moon in the Earth sign of 
Taurus, I invited my neighbour to come and look at my compost bin. Happily, it 
all looks as though it's rotting nicely. She then looked at my gigantic compost 
heap and told me that much of it could be burnt. This surprised me as I though 
it would be too wet. But she then told me that I could borrow her wheelbarrow 
and take all the burnable material to where she was creating a heap for a 
bonfire.<br>
<br>
 What a relief! My compost heap has been so big that I'd had 
to start another one. My site isn't that big and I was getting concerned about 
losing one of my beeds for growing food to another gigantic heap. Now my 
original heap is smaller, and I know that I can burn more material from it. 
This will then create potash which will feed my strawberry beds and apple 
trees. More recycling, the rest will continue to rot down to create beautiful 
compost that will make the clay soil more friendly to young plants.<br>
<br>
 
29/01/12<br>
<br>
 With the Moon in Aries, the focus has been on fruit. 
Although thre isn't much of it at this time of year, I'm looking ahead. My 
strawberry patch was a joy last year but plants were growing too close together 
by the end of the season. So the job has been to clear up the dead leaves. This 
way I can get a sense of how many plants are in the bed and I can thin out 
those that are too tightly packed. This is important as it will help air 
circulate between the plants and minimise the development and subsequent 
spreading of fungus. It will also allow fruit to be more exposed to the sun 
during the ripening stage.<br>
<br>
 25/01/12<br>
<br>
 A Waxing Moon in Pisces 
means that today is an easy day. Water Moons are related to foliage plants and 
these are best delt with on a Waning Moon. So today, I'll water the house 
plants that need it and do some more tidying up.<br>
<br>
 24/01/12<br>
<br>
 
The Moon is now Waxing again and it's in Aquarius. This isn't a Moon associated 
with gardening so I usually use this time for enjoying the garden, 
contemplating changes that need to be made or tidying up. That's exactly what I 
did yesterday. One of my beds needed some attention, clearing weeds, etc. My 
mini greenhouse also need to to be prepared for the start of the growing season 
as it's about to get very busy indeed.<br>
<br>
 The fact that the Moon is in 
an air sign and waxing also made me think of my cauliflower seedlings. Ideally 
they'd be planted when the Moon goes into Gemini, but actually they're growing 
quickly and are desperate for more roomy pots. So I'll prick them out today and 
put them in the mini-greenhouse. Actually, that will only happen if the rain 
stops. So I'm comforting myself in the knowledge that the earth is drinkingly 
deeply and keeping my fingers crossed for a break in the weather for the sake 
of my cauliflowers!<br>
<br>
 21/01/12<br>
<br>
 A holiday and then the need to 
catch up with work have kept me off the allotment. The most I've done is water 
the house plants. I'm itching to go back on Monday. Still, at least I'm not 
worrying about everything becoming overgrown, drying out or overcome with 
weeds. This is the joy of winter. As much as I'm looking forward to the start 
of the growing season, there is such comfort in the slow pace of this season. 
When I get there on Monday, I know I'll be enjoying how quiet and peaceful it 
all looks!<br>
<br>
 10/01/12<br>
<br>
 The Moon is now Waning in the sign of 
Leo so it's time to do some pruning. There are some suckers on my peach tree 
which need to be removed. Suckers appear on the original root stock or trees 
that are grafted. If you have a fruit tree, chances are that it's grafted as 
this is done to provide a more vigorous or dwarf tree, depending on what's 
required. Suckers need to be removed as they drain the tree from its energy.<br>
<br> Other fruit family in need of pruning at this time of year, is the currant 
family. Blacurrants need the oldest and weakest branches removed. The same goes 
for all currants and gooseberries. This is also the time to cut back Autumn 
flowering raspberries. Take care to only removed branches that have fruited or 
you'll reduce the fruit yield for later in the year.<br>
<br>
 6/01/12<br>
<br>

 Today the Moon has been in Gemini. Air sign days are flower days, so my 
thoughts turned to the tulip bulbs which I found on the top shelf of my shed. 
Tulips are expensive but unreliable. Consequently Gardeners often recommend 
that they be treated as annual plants and bought every year. I think this is a 
waste and there is a better way of dealing with them. You can plant them very 
deep and this increases their reliability, but I find the best thing to do is 
to lift the bulbs when the foliage has died down, store them in a dark and 
ventilated place, planting them in November or December.<br>
<br>
 It is now 
January so you will notice that I am late. I planted my last batch in November 
but ran out of time. I then planned to plant them last month but last month, I 
had no time for gardening. So today was the day. It's fine, they'll just be a 
little late. In fact they had begun to sprout on their own. I can look forward 
to a beautiful display in the containers in my garden.<br>
<br>
 2/01/12<br>

<br> Today the Moon has been in Aries. Aries is a Fire sign and so the focus 
was on fruit.&nbsp; A few jobs needed doing that were overdue with last month 
having been taken up with hypnotherapy, nursing a cold and Christmas. So it was 
that I found myself picking olives. It's not a large crop, half a jar, but it's 
the largest ever and an unexpected bonus. The mild weather so far has meant 
that they weren't killed by frost before I got to them. They have now been 
marinated in olive oil, a splash of vinegar, garlic, oregano and salt. It's the 
first time I've done this so I'm looking forward to the results. Olives are too 
bitter to be eaten fresh. Time mellows them.<br>
<br>
 The mild weather has 
also brought on the start of blossom on my nectarine tree. I had hoped to have 
this covered and protected from the rain by the end of November but didn't get 
round to it. Today was the day. I may be too late to prevent peach leaf curl 
later this season, but at least the blossom will be protected from future 
frosts. Fingers crossed, I'll have my first harvest this year!<br>
 1/01/12<br>

<br> The beginning of the New has put me in a thoughtful mood. Last year my 
greatest success were the strawberries. I harvested from the middle of May to 
the middle of July and then to my great surprise I started to pick them again 
in September and carried on into early November. Wow!<br>
<br>
 The greatest 
disappointments were all due to losses brought about by voracious slugs and 
snails. So if I were to have a New Year's resolution for the garden, it's to be 
far more clever and ruthless when it comes to the slimy brigade!!!<br>
<br>
 In 
the meantime, I've started the New Year eating figs from my small tree which is 
taking refuge from the winter indoors. This is a most unexpected and welcome 
surprise!<br>
<br>
 May your harvest this year be abundant and bring you great 
joy!<br>
<br>
 30/12/11<br>
<br>
 A bad Migraine has kept me indoors since 
yesterday. Although it's better today, I've still needed quiet. I have, 
however, been thinking and planning. I've kept a diagram of all the beds on the 
allotment and what's been planted in them from the start (the last two years). 
This makes it easier to plan crop rotation.<br>
<br>
 Crop rotation is very 
necessary as it prevents a build up of pests and diseases associated with 
certain crops from building up in the soil. So for example, garlic and onions 
should be planted on different beds each year.<br>
<br>
 Today I've been 
planning where everything will be grown next year.&nbsp; A very simple, 
necessary and satisfying&nbsp; job that can be done even with a migraine.<br>

<br> 26/12/11<br>
<br>
 It's now been three weeks since I was on the allotment. 
Christmas got in the way last week. There has been some gardening though. While 
I was sick in bed, my apricot tree arrived with three small blueberry bushes. 
The tree is a bare root tree and it remained in its package until Christmas 
Eve. It was the first chance I got to deal with it. I wasn't worried though as 
it's dormant, I knew it would survive a little while. So I soaked the roots in 
a bucket to rehydrate it and then a couple of hours later, it was planted in a 
container. It's staying indoors for the winter to stop it from being exposed to 
cold rain as this will mean that it won't get peach tree wilt.<br>
<br>
 Today 
I also attended to something that got put off while I was sick. I finally got 
the chance to plant my garlic. The Moon was still in Capricorn this morning so 
I knew I was just in time to make the most of a very young Moon in an Earth 
sign. Garlic needs exposure to about three weeks of very cold weather, 
preferably with frost. If it doesn't get this, you will get a very fat bulb 
without division into separate cloves. Thankfully, I think I'll be in time for 
the next cold spell.<br>
 16/12/11<br>
<br>
 It's been two weeks since I was on 
the allotment. Last week I was doing the second part of an intensive 
hypnotherapy course. I was teaching on Sunday and then came down with a 
terrible cold. It's very frustrating!!! I had hoped to have had everything in 
order before Christmas. For one thing, the garlic needs planting and today 
would have been the perfect day.<br>
<br>
 Enough moaning. If you have garlic 
that needs planting, today and tomorrow will be the right days for it. If you 
still have any potatoes in the ground, bring them in.<br>
<br>
 If like me, you 
are house bound, Virgo is a good sign for planting. My seed catalogue arrived 
today. I think I'll be spending a happy hour deciding what to order for next 
year.<br>
<br>
 2/12/11<br>
<br>
 With the days getting shorter, it's harder to 
get the time to be on the allotment. Happily, there is less to do at this time 
of year. So today, I watered my house plants and took a walk in the 
countryside. Two beautiful ponies are currently being used to graze some 
overgrown fields. We became great friends and I felt connected with nature once 
again.<br>
<br>
 30/11/11<br>
<br>
 Today the Moon is in Aquarius. This is an 
air sign so it's a day for flowers. This Moon is the only chance I have to deal 
with flowers while the Moon is Waxing this month, so although Aquarius isn't 
the best gardening Moon, I attended to my cauliflowers. I sowed the seeds last 
month and they're doing well. So today they were pricked out- planted into 
small pots and given some protection- as much from slugs as from the weather. 
I'm looking forward to having them in the early spring.<br>
<br>
 28/11/11<br>

<br> Last year I battled through wind, rain and mud to harvest in winter. That 
taught me the value of having some produce in store so that I don't have to go 
out everyday regardless of the weather. So the potatoes have all been harvested 
which means that they are clean, safe from the attention of slugs, eelworm and 
easily accessable. They are fairly easy to store as long as they are kept cool 
and in the dark, otherwise they begin to go green which makes them poisonous.
<br> <br>
 So I am now turning to the Salsify. With the Moon in Capricorn, an 
Earth sign, roots are the focus. The trouble is that salsify is not a common 
vegetable and no one has been able to tell me whether it's possible to store 
them in the same way that I store potatoes. I feel an experiement coming on. 
I'll let you know the results in due course.<br>
<br>
 25/11/11<br>
<br>
 With 
the Moon in Sagittarius (a Fire Sign), my thoughts turned to fruit. 
Specifically, I needed to check on my peach and nectarine trees. These need 
protection, not from frost but from cold rain. So once the leaves have fallen, 
I'll need to cover them with clear plastic so that they don't get wet but still 
have light. This is a tricky operation as they are in pots. They need to be 
measured so that I could create a kind of tent shelter around them. Tricky and 
fiddly but worth it if I'm to avoid peach leaf curl next year. This is a fungus 
which affects fruit of this family causing leaves to distort and fall in 
summer. Definately something to avoid.<br>
<br>
 24/11/11<br>
<br>
 If you're 
wondering how you can grow salad leaves in winter, then all you need is a 
window sill. You can grow bean sprouts, alfalfa and lettuce. Have a go and 
you'll be healthier throug the winter.<br>
<br>
 23/11/11<br>
<br>
 The Moon is 
now in Scorpio. This is a Water Sign, so it's time to think about leaves and 
herbs. My houseplants got a drink today and I was filled with pride when a 
client complemented me on their healthy appearance.<br>
<br>
 At this time of 
year, although it's still warm in the house, the days are shorter. This means 
that house plants are not growing as actively as they might otherwise. 
Consequently, they need less water and I stop feeding them. Before watering 
them on a Water Moon, I check whether they actually need it.<br>
<br>
 Central 
heating can also be a problem for some plants, so check whether you need to 
spray them so as to increase humidity. If you do so, try to do it early in the 
day so that they aren't wet at night if the heating goes off. Also remember 
that plants with furry foliage are prone to rotting if their leaves are wet.<br>
<br> One final tip- if you have plants on the windowsill, and you close the 
curtains at night, be sure to bring them into the room. If you don't you're 
leaving them exposed to the cold air coming in through the glass, especially if 
you don't have double glazing and you're depriving them of the heat in the room 
because the curtains act like a barrier. I can hear them shivering already!<br>

 22/11/11<br>
<br>
 The Moon is still in Libra and flowers continued to be the 
focus today. One of my allotment neighbours gave me a clump of Crocosmia 
Crocosmiflora, otherwise known and Monbretia. These are beautiful, a much more 
simple version of Gladioli. They grow in clumps of corms, similar to those of 
crocus.<br>
<br>
 They were given to me back in the summer and I haven't had 
the time to do much with them. They came with Couch Grass attached. Today's job 
was to get rid of the grass. In the process some of the clumps of corms broke 
away, thus creating new plants. Although I'd have preferred&nbsp; to have done 
this job on a Waxing Moon, the fact that I was working with the roots of the 
plant, means that the plants can still benefit from the Waning Moon. Very 
satisfying.<br>
<br>
 21/11/11<br>
<br>
 The Moon is now in the Air sign Libra. 
If you have any flower shrubs needing pruning at this time of year, tomorrow 
will be a good day to do it. As the Moon is Waning, there isn't much else to be 
done. There is, however, always weeding. At this time of year, seeds are still 
germinating and although the weeds have slowed down, there is still enough to 
keep me busy. I'm looking forward to some colder weather just so that I can 
feel that I'm on top of things. One thing that has helped is that I've let 
grass grow over my paths. At least now I'm only weeding the beds!<br>
<br>
 
20/11/11<br>
<br>
 With the Moon in the Earth sign Virgo, my thoughts are with 
Compost. I'm often asked what goes into my compost bin. The anser is a 
combination of weeds, grass cuttings, prunings, vegetable peels, fruit peels. 
This includes citrus peels as long as these are free of juice, they're not that 
acid so they're ok. I also include herbal tea bags. Normal tea has too much 
tannin which would acidify the compost.<br>
<br>
 Actually the important thing 
is also to remember not to put in cooked food, meat or dairy products as these 
would attract mice and rats.<br>
<br>
 14/11/11<br>
<br>
 Finally- some time on 
the allotment!&nbsp; Today the Moon has been in Cancer. This being a Waning 
Water Moon, it was time to think of leaves. So I tidied up my Sorrel. This 
means that I took away dead leaves and noticed that I had some rust on other 
leaves. These were immediately removed.<br>
<br>
 I then checked the Spinach 
Beet and Swiss Chard. These are great. Last year they survived our coldest 
winter and the snow, so it's worth looking after them as they provide a ready 
supply of greens through the winter. Like the Sorrel, some of the leaves looked 
a bit tatty. These were removed. Some also had rust on them. These too were 
removed. Now what's left is healthy and in great shape to see me through the 
winter.<br>
<br>
 If you have Sorrel, tomorrow will be a good day to increase 
your supply. You can do this by roughly pulling outone of the stems, ensuring 
that there's a bit of root attached to it. Then plant it and you'll find a new 
plant growing soon. Alternatively, you might find that when you pull on an old 
stem, there is a little shoot of a new plant attached to it. You could also 
divide the plant by simply putting a fork through the middle of it and then 
pulling the two plants apart. This is quite a tough plant that can withstand 
some rough treatment. It's a great alternative to spinach in soups, and sauces. 
But take care that you don't use too much&nbsp; in one meal as it's it's high 
in Oxalic Acid.<br>
<br>
 13/11/11<br>
<br>
 I haven't had any time for the 
allotment the last few days. This is because of the shorter days. The allotment 
is still being enjoyed through the food I'm eating. Pumpkin soup has proved to 
be delicious and popular with all my students! Tomorrow is my day off. The Moon 
will be in Cancer so I'll be checking on my herbs. I think I'll be harvesting 
fennel.<br>
<br>

 It's a Full Moon in Taurus and the Sun is 
shining. I have a half hour window to bring in the last of my potatoes. Then 
that will be it for the winter. At least I know I won't be having to go out to 
harvest them in the wind and rain like last year. That was a real test to my 
commitment to eat my own produce!!!<br>
<br>

 Those who read 
this blog on a regular basis will remember that this year, my biggest battle 
has been with slugs and snails. For this reason, I had to resow my leeks much 
later than I should. They are now a small size but doing well. With the Moon in 
a Water sign, I decided to thin them in the hope that they will grow nice and 
fat in the early spring. This will come in handy as it's likely that my store 
of onions will be dwindling by then.<br>
<br>

<br>
 Early spring 
often is holds a hungry gap. That is to say, it's too early for all the early 
summer crops and the winter crops are done. So with the Moon in Aquarius, and 
it being a day to think about flowers, I turned my thoughts to spring. The 
perfect crop to sow today was cauliflower. With a little protection from the 
worst of the winter weather, I should have at least one crop in the early 
spring.<br>
<br>
 2/11/11<br>
<br>
 The Moon is in Aquarius. Aquarius is not 
the best sign for any gardening activity, but at the moment it is the only Air 
Sign in which the Moon is in the Waxing phase. This means that it was my only 
chance this month to plant my tulip bulbs. They are an indulgence wich will 
provide cut flowers for the house in the spring. I'm very excited about this as 
I've never had the space to grow flowers specifically for the house. I'm loving 
the Autumn but I'm also looking forward to spring!<br>
<br>
 1/11/11<br>
<br>
 
The Moon has been in Capricorn today. This is an earth sign so I focused on 
earthy matters. I turned the material in my compost bin and was delighted to 
find that towards the bottom things are decomposing into something that will 
hopefully be fryable by next spring! This is very exciting as I've never made 
compost before!<br>
<br>
 I also harvested more potatoes. Just one more row to 
bring in. Jackets are in the oven as I write. Yum!<br>
<br>
 27/10/11<br>
<br>
 
With the Moon in Scorpio, the focus is on herbs and leaf vegetables. Today's 
job is to split the peppermint. To do this, I'm going to simply cut the plant 
in half and pot up both pieces. This means that I can have a continuous supply 
of peppermint tea next year. I'm also bringing in more of my herbs for drying. 
Of course to do this, I need to ensure that the leaves are dry when I bring 
them in. With all the rain we've been having, I'm not sure this will be 
possible.<br>
<br>
 26/10/11<br>
<br>
 The Moon is now in Scorpio. This is a 
sign of renewal. Although it feels like everything is dying, I'm planning for 
next year. There wasn't any time for gardening so I'm looking through the 
catalogues getting ready to order garlic and onions.<br>
<br>
 25/10/11<br>
<br>
 Autumn is the time in which we lay the groundwork for next year. With the Moon 
in Libra, it's a good time to collect next year's flower seeds. As it's a 
Waning Moon, you might want to divide your herbacious perennials so as to 
increase your stock next year. This is the ideal day to do it as the Waning 
Moon will promote good root growth. Plan now for next year's beauty!<br>
<br>

 It's been a while since I've had the time to write this 
blog.&nbsp; A couple of weeks ago I was doing an intense hypnotherapy course 
which meant that there was no time for gardening. Wonderful as my course was, I 
missed my allotment!!<br>
<br>
 Last week was spent bringing in the last of the 
harvest. Anything that was prone to frost came in as there were a few very cold 
nights. So it was that I picked the last of my runner beans, French beans and 
borlotti beans. The courgettes came in too. Although I did leave an undersized 
one which not only has survived the cold nights but is growing well!<br>
<br>
 
There have been a few surprises but none greater than the fact that I'm still 
picking strawberries and raspberries.<br>
<br>
 The aubergines in the 
Greenhouse are thriving with fruit developing well. However, the two that are 
on the allotment were beginning to show signs of stress. I dug them up and put 
them in the greenhouse. I think I may have been too late but time will tell.<br>
<br> Other harvests were the green peppers and my first ever bunch of&nbsp; 
grapes!!!! Delicious.<br>
<br>
 More potatoes were harvested and I've been 
drying basil for the winter. the last of the apples were picked and tomatoes 
were also brought in. The green ones are ripening on a widow sill.&nbsp; It 
feels like I'm ready for winter. This is a new feeling for me but brought on by 
ritual of the harves and the laying in of stores. A very new feeling and a very 
enjoyable one!<br>
<br>
 7/10/11<br>
<br>
 The Moon was still in Aquarius. I 
decided to collect seed from my Cornflowers and found that they had already 
self seeded. Little seedlings cropping up all around their bed. Job done!!!<br>

<br> 6/10/11<br>
<br>
 The Moon is in Aquarius today. Aquarius is not a great 
day for gardening so it's a time to enjoy the garden. On the other hand, it 
might be time to tidy things up a little.<br>
<br>
 You might enjoy a little 
video clip that was taken on Tuesday when the Moon was still in Capricorn.

<br> With the Moon in Capricorn, the emphasis has been on roots. I harvested 
more potatoes, some of which are massive.<br>
<br>
 I've also been checking the 
turnips and oriental radishes that I planted last month. The problem is that 
they look so similar that I'm finding it difficult to determine which are which!
<br> <br>
 2/10/11<br>
<br>
 The Moon is still in Sagittarius and today I 
continued my focus on fruit. The recent heat has stimulated my courgettes into 
very fast growth. Today I harvested one that was more like a marrow. A couple 
of days ago it was much smaller!<br>
<br>
 I'm looking at everything and 
thinking that I had better start winding things down before the frosts come. I 
find it hard to believe that we're not in for a shock, given the current summer 
weather. So I'm planning to harvest all the peppers and the runner beans this 
coming week. The peppers can ripen on the window sill. The beans I plan to 
blanche and then freeze. It feels nice to be storing for the harder times to 
come.<br>
<br>
 1/10/11<br>
<br>
 The Moon is now in Sagittarius. This is a 
fruit day. I haven't been on the allotment today but did get to enjoy 
yesterday's harvest- a punnet of strawberries- in October? Delicious but 
confusing!!! Still- I'm not complaining!<br>
<br>
 30/09/11<br>
<br>
 Moon in 
Scorpio is meant to be a good Moon for dealing with Pests. As&nbsp; you have 
read, time and again I've written about my losing battle with slugs and snails. 
Every gardener I know has complained about their over-abundance this year. This 
of course has been due to the wet and cool summer. Now, we're enjoying a hot 
dry spell, we have a reprieve. Actually I'm looking at becoming more efficient 
in weed control next year so that they have less places to hide. Using clear 
plastic bottles with their bottoms cut off as miniature greenhouses has also 
been effective.<br>
 So next year there are a variety of plans which mean that 
whatever the weather, life won't be so easy for the ravenous molluscs!<br>
<br>

 29/09/11<br>
<br>
 I think it was some time in mid-August when I last watered 
the allotment. The heat in the last couple of days has changed everything. With 
the Moon in Scorpio, my thoughts turned to water and a good soak was delivered. 
I had even put my hosepipe away in the back of the shed. What a lovely 
surprise! My grapes may well be edible soon!<br>
<br>
 28/09/11<br>
<br>
 The 
Moon is in Libra today and the sun is shining. It feels like summer and yet 
it's autumn and time to be planning for spring.<br>
<br>
 A Waxing Moon in 
Libra is just right for planting flowers and at this time of year that means 
daffodils and hyacinths.<br>
<br>
 I'm also going to be sowing some annual 
seeds. It stands to reason that these could be sown now if we consider that 
annuals will be shedding their seed now to germinate in the spring. This is 
what happened to my pot marigold, borage and chamomile. This year's wonderful 
crop were self seeded.<br>
<br>
 So I'm taking a leaf out of nature's book and 
sowing some now and some in spring. Those going in now will mean an earlier 
display. The wonderful thing about gardening is that I'm always looking forward 
to something in the future!<br>
<br>
 17/09/11<br>
<br>
 The Moon has been in 
Cancer today. I finally planted my leeks. They are late but as they are winter 
hardy, I'm looking forward to harvesting them in the spring. I find this to be 
the perfect time for them as by the spring, I have run out of onions. Leek and 
chicken pie- yum!<br>
<br>
 16/09/11<br>
<br>
 Today the Moon is in Taurus. My 
thoughts have turned to earthy matters. I'll be harvesting more potatoes, 
checking on the turnips and radishes I planted last month and starting a new 
compost heap. Well this is very necessary as I now have to stand on my tippy 
toes to reach the top which is above my head!<br>
<br>
 15/09/11<br>
<br>
 The 
Moon has still been in Aries through the day and I would normally have been 
feeding my fruit. But, things are beginning to wind down now. The only fruit 
trees that I'm still feeding are the olive and the fig tree. Tomatoes have 
blight due to the lack of sun and excess rain. I've been picking the unaffected 
fruit and some are ripening on the window sill.<br>
<br>
 There are some last 
vestiges of summer as I'm still picking strawberries and raspberries. The beans 
are going strong too and there is that feeling of abundance we get just as we 
approach the end of summer.<br>
<br>
 My breakfasts are changing, and 
reflecting the end of the season too. Gone are the bowls of yoghurt with 
blackcurrant, strawberry or gooseberry sauce. Instead it's porridge with apples 
and cinnamon. Actually with the colder mornings, this is very welcome and 
soothing.<br>
<br>
 14/09/11<br>
<br>
 Raspberries can be tricky to prune. But 
there is a simple rule. Summer fruiting raspberries fruit on the previous 
year's growth so they're best left at the moment or you'll lose next year's 
fruit.<br>
<br>
 Autumn fruiting raspberries fruit on the current year's 
growth. Mine are still fruiting so I'm leaving them for the time being. If 
they've finished when the Moon goes into Leo, I'll prune them then. Otherwise 
I'll wait for the waning Moon next month.<br>
<br>
 It's nice to be picking 
strawberries and raspberries in September, but the real stars of the month are 
the apples. They are making delicious apples tarts!!!<br>
 &nbsp;<br>
 07/09/11
<br> <br>
 The Moon is in Capricorn so I'm turning my attention to potatoes 
today. There is a great crop ready to be harvested and I'm just about to head 
out.<br>
<br>
 My thoughts have also been on Composting. As a Biodynamic 
gardener, I'm supposed to make a special preparation and put it in a cow's horn 
to then bury it. So it was that last week, when the Moon was in another earth 
sign, Virgo, I found myself at a farm shop asking them whether their cattle had 
horns. After quizzical looks, I explained my dilemma. They would look around 
they said and let me know. Sadly, my hunt continues. Biodynamic gardening has 
turned into quite an adventure.<br>
<br>
 3/09/11<br>
<br>
 It was wonderful to 
have a couple of days of sunshine, but it's a pity it didn't last longer! 
Friday's heat was so welcome that my pumpkins actually started to change colour 
and ripen for the first time. Sadly the burst of heat was short lived and the 
rain is back!!! I'm actually planning to be up before 7 tomorrow, on my day off 
so that I can have some time gardening before the rain! I'm getting a bit 
desperate. I miss it when I can't get out there!<br>
<br>
 Today the Moon is in 
Sagittarius as I've been working I haven't been able to do much, and anyway it 
was raining. It was still a fruit day as I made an apple tart for my students 
with apples harvested yesterday. One of my students brought me a bag of apples 
from her tree and some apple chutney! It may not feel like summer but it still 
feels like a time of great abundance!<br>
<br>
 2/09/11<br>
<br>
 The Moon is 
now in Scorpio and the Sun is shining. I'm looking forward to a little time on 
the allotment- well about half an hour. This is enough time to take some 
cuttings from mint and peppermint. I'll also be feeding my Japanese Laurel. 
It's very large and in a container in the garden. Of late it's leaves have been 
losing their vivid green colour. It's been looking a bit anaemic, so to speak. 
So it's lacking in something, probably iron. The same feed that I use for the 
Camellia and Magnolia should help.<br>
<br>
 1/09/11<br>
<br>
 The Moon was 
still in Libra this afternoon. I picked some chamomile flowers, blended them 
together with oatmeal and put the mixture in a muslin bag. This is ideal for 
putting in the bath but I like to use it to wash my face.<br>
<br>
 Borage 
flowers were also picked. These are painted with an Arabic powder and Rose 
Water paste to be crystallised and used for cake decorations.<br>
<br>
 As it's 
a Waxing Moon, I also sowed some Hollyhocks and Foxgloves. It was lovely to do 
so in warm sunshine for a change!<br>
<br>
 31/08/11<br>
<br>
 The Moon is in 
Libra today. Libra is an air sign and air signs are linked with flowers, so 
today is a flower day. I didn't deadhead my lilies earlier in the season and so 
they are producing seed. This isn't ideal as it means that energy has gone into 
seed production rather than into the bulbs for next year's flowers. However, 
there is a silver lining. I'm going to harvest the seed to sow. It will take a 
few years to produce a bulb large enough to flower but I'll enjoy trying.<br>

<br> Other seeds ripe for collection are those of my foxgloves and my 
hollyhocks. I'm going to sow some on the allotment to ensure that there's a 
good supply of pollen for bees.<br>
<br>
 On another note, I'm also going to 
plant a honeysuckle against my shed. It too will feed the bees, and provide me 
with wonderful scent when I'm working. It makes me look forward to next year 
already!<br>
<br>
 28/08/11<br>
<br>
 Rain and work have continued to keep me 
away from the allotment but with the Moon in Leo, it's been about feeding my 
fruit. So tomatoes, cucumbers, aubergines, olives and figs have had some 
attention in between showers, doing a radio show and teaching today! I think 
I'll put my feet up now!<br>
<br>
 26/08/11<br>
<br>
 Rain and work have kept 
me from the allotment for the last few days. I miss it!!!!<br>
<br>
 In the 
meantime, I've been dealing with some of the harvest. My bramley apples are 
enourmous. Last week I made apple sauce. This week I'm making mincemeat for the 
mince pies and Christmas pudding which will be made later in the autumn. It's 
all very exciting!<br>
<br>
 22/08/11<br>
<br>
 The Moon is now in Gemini. This 
is a flower day, so my attention turned to my Magnolia and Camellia. These are 
very large and growing in containers. Consequently, they need special care. 
Manolias and Camellias develop their flower buds during August so it's 
important that they are fed and kept well watered during this period. They need 
acid soil so you need to ensure that what you feed is appropriate for them.<br>

<br> I also collected some marigolds to add to the gel from my aloe vera plant. 
Together with a few drops of lavender oil, I now have a gel in the freezer to 
help with burns.<br>
<br>
 21/08/11<br>
<br>
 With the Moon still in Taurus, I 
continued to focus on root vegetables. This time I planted turnips, an oriental 
radish variety as well as more beetroot and carrots. I also sowed some more 
spring onion seeds. It's nice to still be sowing seeds at this time of year.<br>
<br> 20/08/11<br>
<br>
 The Moon has been in Taurus today. Being an Earth sign, 
Taurus meant that it was time to deal with root vegetables. I planted more 
parsnips (very late due slugs devouring previous plantings), beetroot, carrots, 
celeriac and spring onions.<br>
<br>
 I also harvested the first lot of onions. 
They are massive! I think there will be caramelised onion tarts and French 
Onion soups in the coming months!<br>
<br>
 19/08/11<br>
<br>
 With the Moon 
still in Aries this morning, I continued to focus on fruit. I fed the tomatoes, 
figs, olives, cucumbers and aubergines.<br>
<br>
 On the subject of tomatoes, 
at the RHS Wisley gardens this afternoon, I noticed that their tomatoes were 
just beginning to ripen. It just goes to show what poor light levels we've had.
<br> <br>
 Happily though, this morning was delightfully sunny so I started to 
work on my tomatoes to ensure that they got as much exposure to the sun as 
possible. To do this, I removed all leaves that were stopping them from getting 
the sun. This is a job I normally do towards the end of September when I want 
them to ripen before the frosts. Removing the leaves at this point doesn't 
worry me as I want the focus to shift from growth to ripening. With any luck 
this and a bit of sunshine should do the trick.<br>
<br>
 18/08/11<br>

<p>I love this time of year. Abundance is everywhere! The Moon has been in 
Aries today, so my attention was on fruit. My strawberries are threatening to 
take over my plot so I've been lifting runners and giving them to fellow 
allotment holders. A few of them will have strawberries descended from mine 
next year. In fact one of them got so many plants from me that she's going to 
share them with her daughter.</p> 
<p>If you like strawberries and have a little space for them, now is a great 
time of year to buy a few or ask a friend who has some to give you some 
runners. Runners are the way in which strawberries propagate themselves. They 
throw out what looks like a chord with baby strawberry plants on it. When these 
touch the soil, they form roots. You can then cut the chord and you have a new 
plant. It's a very easy way to propagate strawberries and at this time of year 
they are very busy multiplying. That's why it's a good time to start now for 
delicious sensations next year!</p> 
<p>Tomatoes though seem to be slow to ripen this year. Low light levels are to 
blame. We've been getting a mix of sun and cloud everyday but they really need 
a few days of clear skies and sunshine!!!</p> Blackberries are in abundance 
now. Today I made blackberry jam. If you have access to blackberries, enjoy 
them now. You know they are at their sweetest when you can pick them easily. If 
you pull and there is resistance, they are not yet fully ripe. Enjoy!<br>
<br>
 
10/08/11<br>
<br>
 I'm so grateful for my allotment! In the last few days with 
tensions running so high, I've taken refuge there. Whatever happens outside, 
nature just goes on oblivious to our madness.<br>
<br>
 Today with the Moon in 
Capricorn, I turned to look at my root vegetables. Happily my shallots are 
ready to be lifted. It's harvest time!<br>
<br>
 09/08/11<br>
<br>
<br>
 My 
strawberries are flowering again! A second, albeit lesser crop is coming. I 
can't believe my luck! They too deserved a feed.<br>
<br>
 Finally the bramble 
bush, which I left on site because the thought of free blackberries was too 
appealing, was beginning to get out of control. Although pruning is normally 
done on a waning Moon, this could easily become an uncontrollable thug so I 
pruned it today in the hope of reducing its vigour. The fruit has been worth it!
<br> <br>
 08/08/11<br>
<br>
 The Moon is in Sagittarius. My attention was 
turned to fruit. The tomatoes have been fed, as have the olives.<br>
<br>
 The 
currant bushes fruited well this year and needed a little attention. I weeded 
around them and applied a dressing of compost. It was a very satisfying thing 
to do a way of saying a big thank-you. Thanks to them, my breakfasts continue 
to be delicious!<br>
<br>
 6/08/11<br>
<br>
 With the Moon still in Scorpio, I 
have been watering and feeding my houseplants.<br>
<br>
 I also spent some time 
looking after my cabbages. I have yet to net them, so they have had little 
protection from pigeons and cabbage white butterflies. I covered them with 
plastic bottles just to protect them until I have time to create a netted cage 
around them.<br>
<br>
 Weeding around the lettuces and spinach beet has 
revealed that they are in great shape and that I'll soon be having great salads 
and stir fries.<br>
<br>
 I love the way a little heat has brought everything 
on. I was away for four days and returned to growth that might have been 
expected after two weeks!<br>
<br>
 Dinner includes courgettes, peas and 
mangetout- yum!!!!<br>
<br>
 5/08/11<br>
<br>
 The Moon is now in Scorpio. 
Scorpio being a water sign, it's a day for dealing with leaf vegetables. 
Actually, I decided to have a look at the comfrey concoction that I made a few 
weeks ago. To say that it stinks is a gross understatement! I'm so glad that I 
openedthe bucket in the open air instead of in the shed!!!!<br>
<br>
 I diluted 
it about half the watering can to half water and proceeded to feed leaf 
vegetables and herbs. If the smell is indicative of the good it will do them, 
they should thrive!!!<br>
<br>
 I then cut back the comfrey once again and used 
its leaves to make another batch.<br>
<br>
 It's my first time doing all of 
this. It's an exciting experiement.<br>
<br>
 2/08/11<br>
<br>
 With the Moon 
in Virgo, I've turned my attention to roots- actually my potatoes. I got an 
early harvest from a few last week. I wasn't expecting any for another month. 
But I noticed while watering the other day that some potatoes were peeking up 
above the soil. This is not good news as when exposed to light, they go green 
which is poisonous. Also I noticed that they are producing seed. Interestingly, 
last year this didn't happen. Looking back, I remember accidently cutting back 
the flowers- no flowers, no seed. The seeds look very much like tomatoes, as 
they are from the same family. Seeds are not good news as the plant will then 
put all its energy into producing seed instead of continuing to grow and 
producing tubers (potatoes). I removed them and then earthed up the visible 
potatoes. One of my very experienced allotment neighbours reassured me that if 
I did that now, they'd still be ok. She also said that even if the tops go 
green, I could remove the green part and enjoy the rest safely. Hurray!<br>
<br>
 31/07/11<br>
<br>
 It's been a hot day and it was wonderful to be outdoors. 
Leo Moons are a good time to do some weeding. In fact the idea is that if 
you're clearing land, you do so when the Moon is in Capricorn to start, then 
you do it again when the Moon is in Leo. The idea is that between the Moon in 
Capricorn and the Moon in Leo, seeds will have germinated. Then you clear it 
again and more will germinate in time to clear a third time when the Moon is in 
Capricorn.<br>
<br>
 Sadly for me, due to the fact that it's my second year on 
an allotment that had been abandoned for three years, weeding happens on a 
daily basis.<br>
 &nbsp;<br>
 Having spent all summer last year clearing 
brambles, bindweed and couch grass, this year I've been dealing with the weeds 
that were dormant on the plot. I think it's reducing in the more established 
parts of the plot so there is hope! In the meantime my compost heap is more 
like a hill!<br>
<br>
 30/07/11<br>
<br>
 The Moon is in Leo, whilst still 
Waning, I decided to cut back some of the foliage of my tomatoes. I also tied 
back some floppy branches. I now smell of tomatoes. Thankfully this is a smell 
I really like.<br>
<br>
 I also fed other fruit like figs and the olives. It's 
worth feeding the olives, I know that I get better results when I have done so 
in the past. As for the figs, I'm helping them to swell to a bigger size before 
they ripen.<br>
<br>
 I can't quite believe that I'm going to enjoy a second 
crop of figs this year without even leaving the UK! As for the olives, they're 
a bonus.<br>
<br>
 29/07/11<br>
<br>
 It's been a while since my last blog, but 
I have continued to work on my allotment. Yesterday with the Moon in Cancer, I 
sowed some chickory seeds and planted more spinach beet, swiss chard, lettuce 
and radiccio. The battle with slugs continues. I have been bringing young 
plants in at night and forgot. Having been up late, I found myself at one in 
the morning remembering that plants hadn't been brought in. Half not believing 
what I was doing, I found myself getting up to bring them in from the garden. 
Just as well, I found three snails munching through my parsnips and five on 
their way to young carrots! As this is my last chance to have these this year, 
I think it was worth getting out of bed. Two lost parsnips, minimal losses. 
Success! Mind you I think I'll be better at remembering to bring them in, in 
future.<br>
<br>
 20/07/11<br>
<br>
 Rain, rain and more rain. Remember doing a 
rain dance? Well I think it's time we did a sun dance!!!<br>
<br>
 Today Iraced 
to do some planting while the Moon was still in Pisces. This means that I was 
planting in the rain. I was wearing a rain coat and surprisingly enjoyed the 
experience as the rain was quite soft. What I didn't enjoy was the slugs, which 
believe that the plot is theirs in this weather. Well a few of them met their 
maker this afternoon. They were making their way to my courgettes, an offense 
payable by death!<br>
<br>
 I planted cabbages, swiss chard, spinach beat and 
celery. I hope they survive the night!<br>
<br>
 19/07/11<br>
<br>
 The Moon is 
in Pisces and Waning. So this afternoon was spent dodging showers and pricking 
out lettuce, chervil, coriander, spinach beet and swiss chard, radicchio. I'm 
so delighted that my coriander has actually survived the slugs. It's only 
because I have taken to covering it at night. I'll continue to do so for a bit 
longer. I want it to get bigger before planting it. Still at last there is hope!
<br> <br>
 15/07/11<br>
<br>
 The Moon in Capricorn is now Waning so it's a 
good time to sow more carrots, beetroot and radishes. I'm also sowing some 
turnips.<br>
<br>
 The fight with the slugs is continuing and to avoid further 
losses of celeriac and parsnips I've been sowing in seed trays and waiting for 
the plants to be big enough to plant in the allotment. So today I'm pricking 
out last month's sowings. It's time consuming but at least it helps. In fact, 
I've resorted to bringing seedtrays in at night!<br>
 With the Moon in the 
Earth sign of Virgo, yesterday and today, the focus has been on compost. As you 
might imagine transforming my plot from a wilderness into a well tended garden 
has created large compost heaps. In fact there were four. One of them is so 
high that it's at eye level and looks very much like a wall! Thankfully, it has 
already begun to shrink. I was beginning to worry that it would collapse in the 
high winds and rain that we had in June.<br>
<br>
 The oldest of the heaps is 
about 7 months old and is taking up space which is very much needed for the 
planting of purple sprouting broccoli and cauliflower that I'm planning when 
the Moon goes into Libra. Happily, it has shrunk and most of the matter has 
decomposed. So yesterday I began the process of removing any uncomposted 
material to add to the other heaps for further composting. I then began to dig 
the new compost into the area. It's quite a job as it covers about 2 square 
metres but very satisfying. Today I plan to finish the job. The bonus yesterday 
was finding a tiny brown lizard. In the UK, I've only ever seen these on TV. I 
gently carried him to the other compost heap and hope that he's busy devouring 
slugs!!!!<br>

 The soft fruit is all in. Jam, jellies, 
tonics, and sauces have been made. Good job I had some time off this last week. 
The Waning Moon was just what I needed. I'm still harvesting some strawberries 
but with less regularity. What a bonus. To come are the blackberries. I left a 
bramble to grow on the edge of my plot so as to keep the delicious fruit, 
although of course I know for its sweetness, it's actually a thug with world 
domination as its aim. So I have to keep it in check and then enjoy the fruit.
<br> <br>
 The Moon is in Leo and it's Waxing now. So it's time to feed fruit 
like tomatoes, aubergines, cucumbers, peppers, courgettes, pumpkins and 
squashes. Beans and peas could use a boost too. Liquid seaweed or if you're 
close enough to collect seaweed, you can put it on your beds. Ideally you would 
have done that earlier in the season though. So liquid feeds are best at this 
time.<br>
<br>
 I think I'll sow some more French Beans that will extend the 
season.<br>
<br>
 1/07/11<br>
<br>
 My gooseberries were wonderful and have 
been turned into a sauce which will be used to flavour cakes and desserts.<br>

<br> However wonderful the gooseberry harvest was though, it pales into 
insignificance compared to the redcurrant harvest of today! My redcurrant bush 
was dripping with fruit and the bowl I brought for harvesting was really 
nowhere near enough. I ended up filling a shopping bag as well! Redcurrant 
jelly next!<br>
<br>
 The Moon is now waxing so the shift will be to fruit and 
flowers for the next couple of weeks.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
 30/06/11<br>
<br>
 
Today's harvest was gooseberries. I have probably left them on the bush a bit 
longer than I should but I've been so busy with the strawberries that 
everything else had to wait. Actually, I found that I prefer them a little 
riper. They taste sweeter like a cross between a melon and a grape.<br>
<br>
 
I've been making the most of the remaining hours of the Waning Moon to make my 
preserves. So today, it was gooseberry sauce and tomorrow it will be gooseberry 
jam. The sauce can again be used with yoghurt and desserts as well as being 
frozen.<br>
<br>
 This is such an improvement on last year when I had four 
gooseberries and two of them were had by the pigeons!<br>
<br>
 27/06/11<br>

<br> It's been a very hot day, so I found myself watering everything very 
thoroughly again today. Rain had been expected but it didn't arrive and with 
young seedlings, and the heat, I didn't want to risk waiting to see if rain 
would arrive tonight.<br>
<br>
 I thought about pricking out some carrot and 
fennel seedlings but decided to wait for the Moon in Capricorn as they still 
look quite young. You may wonder why I haven't just sown the seed straight into 
the ground, but I haven't yet had much success with this due to the large slug 
population so the tried and trusted method is preferred.<br>
<br>
 The 
strawberries are slowing down now, but along with raspberries, there's still 
enough for breakfast. Today the triumph was the blackcurrants though. I 
harvested enough to make plenty of blackcurrant tonic. As blackcurrants are 
rich in Vitamin C, I freeze some of this tonic to have in winter and the 
smallest sign of colds. The rest is enjoyed through the summer with yoghurt for 
breakfast. My mouth is already watering!<br>
<br>
 26/06/11<br>
<br>
 Jupiter 
is a planet of abundance and today the Moon has been very close to it. After 
teaching, I went over to the allotment and was given more squashes and 
courgettes by a friend. I gave her some strawberry runners and salsify. It 
certainly felt abundant.<br>
 &nbsp;<br>
 I also planted salsify and some more 
red onions, which are late and I don't expect to harves before next spring. I 
wonder if they'll grow extra large having been planted on a Moon Jupiter 
Conjunction!<br>
<br>
 25/06/11<br>
<br>
 In preparation for the Moon in Taurus 
tomorrow, and the planting of a new bed, my partner kindly got me some more 
compost from the recycling centre. 9 very heavy bags of &quot;the good 
stuff&quot; as one of my fellow allotment holders called it. And good stuff it 
is- soft crumbly and a rich dark colour for salsify, carrots, parsnips and 
other rooty delights.<br>
<br>
 In order to put this on the plot, I went to the 
centre of the allotment where wheelbarrows are kept and shared. It was an 
opportunity to admire everyone's plots which look wonderful! After putting the 
wheelbarrow away, I stopped to have a chat with the proud holders of a plot 
which is without a doubt the prettiest and best kept on the whole site. In fact 
it wins awards every year. She came and visited my site and I proudly showed 
her a cleared plot. She was so excited for me as she remembered a wilderness! 
This reminded me of how far I've come. The bonus came when we were chatting 
about the season, and I told her about the loss of my pumpkins and squashes to 
the onslaught of slugs and snails. Replacements were promptly and generously 
offered as she said she had too many. This is the other reason why I love being 
on my allotment. It's one of the few places where we still find community 
spirit. Yesterday I gave strawberry runners to someone else.<br>
 Happily all 
of this exchanging of fruit happened on a Fire Moon.<br>
<br>
 23/06/11<br>
<br>
 The Moon has been in Aries today, but as it's waning, this is a quiet time in 
the garden. So time was spent tidying up and enjoying what's there. I noticed 
my cucumbers are doing well and look forward to my first salad with them.<br>

<br> 22/06/11<br>
<br>
 The Moon is still in Pisces and it was so wet earlier 
that a fish might have had a good time! Nevertheless, I did manage to get out 
into the garden to plant some Basil and a Lemon Verbena.<br>
<br>
 The slugs 
and snails are thriving in this wet weather and of course they regard my 
plantings as their personal supermarket! So I sowed more lettuce, swiss chard, 
spinach beet, radiccio and - coriander! This time I've put them somewhere safe- 
indoors and here they will remain until they are big enough to contend with 
molluscs!<br>
<br>
 21/06/11<br>

The Moon has been in Pisces today. It is still waning so it was a good day to 
cut back my comfrey and to make comfrey soup. This is for the benefit of my 
plants not my dinner. I filled a bucket with comfrey leaves and then filled it 
with water. I then covered it. I will leave it for a while and then when it is 
suitably stinky, it will provide a very nutritious feed for my plants. I think 
my strawberries will be the first to be fed. They will be weaker having 
produced so much fruit. I'll also provide some for my cherry tree for the same 
reason.<br>
<br>
 This year's cherry harvest has been very limited compared to 
last year. I think that it may be that when it was in blossom we had some very 
bad windy and wet weather, so it's possible that there weren't as many insects 
around to pollinate fully.<br>
<br>
 Still on the subject of fruit, I had my 
first figs today! They were like honey and for a few moments, I was on holiday 
in Spain! I only have two more left ripening on the tree. This is only the 
first year, but what a great sign of things to come.<br>
<br>
 Being a Water 
Moon, and therefore a leaf day, I also planted some rhubarb, oregano and 
coriander today. This is my third attempt at coriander this year, the slugs 
have had every plant so far. This one is bigger so I think I'm in with a 
chance. Fingers crossed once again.<br>
<br>
 20/06/11<br>
<br>
 The Moon is 
Waning once again. Waning Moons are good for harvesting and preserving. At the 
moment, I'm harvesting soft fruit. The abundance of strawberries means that 
there is enough to make strawberry jam. I'm also planning to make a strawberry 
sauce that I could freeze and then use to flavour yoghurts, ice cream, cakes, 
etc.<br>
<br>
 Blackcurrants will be turned into a tonic and jam. Redcurrants 
will be turned into a jelly and I'm still thinking about what to do with the 
whitecurrants and the gooseberries.<br>
 It's going to be a busy few days. But 
the Moon in Aquarius which is not a great Moon for any gardening, has allowed 
me the time to plan the next few days to deal with surplus fruit.<br>
 &nbsp;
<br> 15/06/11<br>
<br>
 It's been a very busy few days. On Monday, my day off, 
not much time was given to rest. In fact I spent 7 hours in total clearing the 
rest of my allotment. I was completely shattered but the efforts were very 
worthwhile as I can now just enjoy gardening without having to clear and dig! 
It's been a long time coming and the final push took a lot of determination but 
I wanted to be free!<br>
<br>
 The final push also meant that yesterday I was 
able to make use of the Moon in a Waxing Fire sign (Sagittarius) and finish 
planting all fruit. So my beans and two more varieties of squashes went in. I 
also sowed another variety of peas.<br>
<br>
 There has been a big shift with 
the quality of my strawberries. The recent wet weather has made them more prone 
to rot and I have had to remove many. The other difference is that during the 
sunny weather, I could smell them while I was working on the allotment. Also 
when there were bowls in the fridge and&nbsp; the fridge was opened, you were 
hit by the smell of strawberries. This is no longer the case and this means 
that they're no longer as sweet as they were. Yesterday, with the sunny 
weather, the old fragrance was back and so was the smell!<br>
<br>
 Happily the 
harvest has been very generous and although the weather has made a difference, 
the flavour is still good and I am very spoiled. Strawberries for breakfast 
every morning and today there were raspberries too!! Heaven!<br>
<br>
 10/06/11
<br> The Moon has been in Libra today so the focus has been on flowers and 
flowering vegetables. I've planted broccoli, more Aquilegias, Statice and 
Pinks. I've also pricked out Sunflowers, and the few Larkspur and Nicotiana 
seedlings left by the slugs!<br>
<br>
 This year the focus has been on getting 
the allotments in order whilst planting. This is nearly done. The next project 
is going to focus on soil and SLUG&nbsp; CONTROL!!!!<br>
<br>

 Virgo is a very forgiving sign 
in the garden. The sign associated with harvest, it is very helpful for 
biodymanic gardeners. So when the Moon is in Virgo, we can do things that we 
haven't had the chance to do because of very busy lives. So it was that despite 
the fact that the Moon is Waxing and root vegetables are best planted on Waning 
Moons, I planted some forgotten red onion sets. They are very late but I figure 
that the worst that can happen is that I'll have some early onions next year.
<br> <br>
 I also sowed some parsnip and celeriac seeds. They are late but 
previous attention from slugs and snails have left me with one parsnip plant! I 
think I might just be in time. Again, I'm thinking the harvest for both will 
just be delayed and as the packet of seeds' viability was only guaranteed for 
this year, I had nothing to lose.<br>
<br>
 7/06/11<br>
<br>
 Yesterday, my day 
off, was exceptionally busy! The calendar will give a clue as to the reason for 
this burst of activity. A waxing Moon in a fire sign means it's a planting day. 
So I potted my cucumbers on. They are doing really well with baby cucumbers 
already visible. I have a plastic mini greenhouse which my partner has screwed 
to the back of my shed to stop it blowing away. It has been full of seedlings. 
I've decided to keep growing my cucumbers in it, as they seem to do so well 
there. So I've now got them in big pots and as I clear it from other plants, 
they will have a dedicated space. I did plant one outdoors though just to see 
how it does.<br>
<br>
 Next, I saw to the tomatoes. These are easily grown in 
containers. Growing them on the allotment made them prone to blight. My garden 
is small, but it is walled. I have never had blight there and have managed to 
pick tomatoes in November due to the shelter from the walls. So this year, I've 
decided to grow them in large containers in the garden again. It means that 
watering and feeding is crucial, but it also makes for a longer growing season 
so it's well worth the effort!<br>
<br>
 Sweet corn, courgettes and peppers 
were planted on the allotment. As for aubergines, I was undecided. Last year 
they didn't do very well on the allotment but that may be because they were 
growing next to some large cape gooseberries which meant that there was hardly 
any light available for them. So I decided to plant half in the green house 
with the cucumbers and the other half out on the allotment. I say half, it 
sounds like large numbers but actually there were only four plants!<br>
<br>
 
Cape gooseberries/ Physallis, did very well last year. That is they grew into 
sizeable bushes and did flower but never actually set fruit. I think they need 
a longer growing season. So I planted a few in pots also in the mini green 
house. I had some left over and put them on the allotment again, just in case 
we get an Indian Summer. That's it for the mini greenhouse! It's now very full 
again!<br>
<br>
 I am still off today, thankfully as I have pumpkins and more 
peas to put in. Also there are beans and squashes that need pricking out. I'd 
better get started.<br>
<br>
 4/06/11<br>
<br>
 Yesterday morning the Moon went 
into the sign of Cancer and it will remain ther until around 4pm tomorrow. This 
means that it's in a water sign on a Waxing Moon. This is not the best time for 
planting leaf vegetables or herbs, so rather than spend time gardening, I went 
to the RHS gardens at Wisley. These are simply wonderful and there are few 
pleasures that compare to walking barefoot on a cool lawn, on a hot summer's 
day! The lawned path along the avenue with herbacious borders on either side, 
gives you the opportunity to do just that.<br>
<br>
 Then there is the rose 
garden which at this time of year is filled with scent. I drank the scent of 
some roses and then decided that it was time to head home. Not without visiting 
the shop first, of course! I can never leave without a new addition for the 
garden. Yesterday it was rhubarb, oregano as mine died in the hard winter, and 
some coriander as slugs keep eating my seedlings. I also bought one of my 
favourite herbs of all time- lemon verbena. Look out for it, the smell is 
simply delicious.<br>
<br>
 I will now wait for the Waning Moon in Pisces to 
plant my new treasures.<br>
<br>
 In the meantime, today was spent preparing 
yet another bead for the all the planting that I'll be doing with the Moon in 
Leo. That's coming tomorrow afternoon. I think I'm just ready!<br>
<br>
 2/06/11
<br> <br>
 The Moon is now Waxing and today it has been in the sign of Gemini. 
As this is an Air sign, it was a day for flowers. So I planted some Aquilegias, 
also known as Columbines. I sowed these seeds last year and they're now ready 
to plant in a border. I've planted them in a nursery bed on the allotment with 
a view to have some to cut and bring indoors, but also to then find room for 
them in the front garden. Plants benefit from being in a nursery bed for a 
while as they have less competition than in border with lots of grown up and 
competing plants.<br>
<br>
 I had planned to plant cauliflower and purple 
sprouting broccoli today but the recycling centre was out of compost and the 
clay soil on a newly dug bed is just too harsh for young seedlings. I'll wait 
for the compost to come in and then plant them next week when the Moon goes 
into Libra. That's the great thing about biodynamics, there's usually another 
day!<br>
<br>
 1/06/11<br>
<br>
 Today was a quiet day in gardening terms. The 
Moon was still Waning in an Air Moon. Air Moons are flower days but as the Moon 
was waning, I decided to wait for tomorrow to start planting. Flowers need a 
Waxing Moon which is what we'll have tomorrow. In the meantime, I prepared a 
bed to plant the cauliflowers and purple sprouting broccoli tomorrow.<br>
<br>
 
Of course, I also picked strawberries. Heaven!!!<br>
<br>
 31/05/11<br>

<p>Carrots and parsnips like soft, friable soil; soil that they can grow 
through without much resistance. Otherwise they develop into odd, contorted 
shapes. Last year, my priority was to tame the wilderness that was my allotment 
and plant it. Time was not on my side as digging down a meter in some places is 
slow, gruelling work. This meant that my attempts to improve my sticky, clay 
soil were limited. In fact, I did mix in compost that my partner got from the 
local recycling centre but as you can appreciate, with 125sq metres, I had to 
make it stretch a little. This meant that my parsnips in particular looked like 
something out of a parsnip horror movie!</p> 
<p>Like a parent unwilling to give up on her unpromising child, I defended my 
misshapen parsnips on the grounds that looks don&rsquo;t matter and that nobody 
would know what they looked like, once they&rsquo;d been cut. Indeed this was 
the case, and they were absolutely delicious. Sweet and creamy beyond any 
parsnips I&rsquo;ve had anywhere else. However, there was a fly in the 
ointment. Vegetables don&rsquo;t come clean and prepared from the plot. In 
winter, root vegetables are muddy, especially if grown in clay! And so it was 
that each parsnip, due to its many contortions took twenty minutes to wash in 
the garden, be scrubbed in the kitchen and then finally cut, with all the 
little crevices cleaned. Having always loved parsnips, I planted many- so you 
can imagine how much time they took to prepare! Everyone who ate them, loved 
them, but no one knew what a labour of love was sitting on their plate! </p> 
<p>Having fallen out of love with cleaning parsnips, I determined that this 
year, things will be different. To this end, I spent the better part of 
yesterday afternoon digging a bed for them. My partner went back to the 
recycling centre and brought bags of beautiful compost. This morning I planted 
carrots, parsnips, beetroot and celeriac. I do hope the carrots and parsnips 
will be straight this time!</p> 29/05/11<br>
<br>
 The Moon went into Taurus 
this afternoon and it was nice to have unlimited time on my allotment for a 
change. Being an earth Moon, I spent time earthing up my potatoes. This seemed 
such a mysterious process when I first did it last year.<br>
<br>
 Potatoes, 
that is the tubers that we plant, need to be kept from light. If they peep 
above the ground, then they are exposed to the light andwill go green. They 
then become poisonous. So as the leaves start to develop, we need to at least 
part cover them with earth. It seems counter-intuitive to bury a growing plant, 
but it it necessary. If you are growing potatoes in containers, this is easy to 
do. If you are growing them in the ground, it's easier to do it, if you have 
grown them in rows.<br>
<br>
 Another windy afternoon, but the sun came out and 
it was very pleasant indeed.<br>
<br>
 28/05/11<br>
<br>
 The Moon is still in 
Aries. This morning I picked more wonderful strawberries! I think I found 
heaven!<br>
<br>
 My apple trees are laden with little apples. Although this 
appears like a good thing, actually they need thinning out. June is the month 
when apple trees often shed excess fruit. This enables the tree to concentrate 
its resources on the remaining fruit, producing bigger apples. If it doesn't 
shed enough, then next month, while the Moon is still waning in Aries, I'll do 
some thinning myself.<br>
<br>
 Cherries often do the same thing. This year's 
crop looks a little thinner than last year's so I'm hoping the cherries will be 
bigger!<br>
 27/05/11<br>
<br>
 The Moon is in Aries. That means that this is a 
fruit day. But planting my beans will have to wait as it's a Waning Moon. So 
it's time to prune and feed. I've noticed a few small branches on my peach 
which are dead, so they'll be coming off. My cherries are doing well but could 
use a feed.&nbsp; I've also noticed that my olive tree is in bloom. I'll start 
to feed it and keep my fingers crossed. I seem to cross my fingers frequently 
when gardening!<br>
<br>
 25/05/11<br>
<br>
 Today the Moon is in Pisces. Being 
a Waning water Moon means that the focus has been on leafy vegetables. The link 
between water moons and leaves is due to the fact that the actual body of a 
plant is largely made up of water. So today I planted cabbages, lettuce, 
spinach beet, swiss chard, coriander, thyme and chamomile.<br>
<br>
 Slugs seem 
to love coriander. They've already decimated my first sowing. This is my 
second. I do have a third just in case, but it would be really nice if they 
would leave this batch to me!!!<br>
<br>
 It is possible to get nemetodes that 
predate on slugs. I think I'll try to get a hold of some.<br>
<br>
 24/05/11<br>
<br> Being on holiday is wonderful, but coming home is always a delight for me. 
This time it was especially so as I returned to ripe strawberries. Picking them 
in the sunshine was heavenly.<br>
<br>
 We've had some rain in the South East 
at the weekend but not enough. Driving into the South East from Wales, I became 
very aware of how parched everything looks compared to the West. It would be 
good to get some significant rain before the New Moon. Does anyone know a rain 
dance?<br>
<br>
 17/05/11<br>
<br>
 The Moon is Waning once again. During this 
period the focus shifts from fruit and flowers to roots and leaf plants. But it 
is also a good time to prune, and feed. Perhaps pruning could wait until next 
week when the Moon's cycle will be further from the Full Moon. The ground is 
more absorbant during a Waning Moon, so this is a good time to water and feed. 
Rain would now be most welcome!<br>
<br>
 13/05/11<br>
<br>
 Virgo is a sign 
associated with harvest. Yesterday, I picked my first ripe strawberry. I shared 
it with my partner and it was delicious!!!! If that's a sign of things to come, 
I will be having a very good strawberry season indeed.<br>
<br>
 This afternoon 
the Moon will go into Libra. It's all about flowers, including broccoli. I have 
larkspur, sunflowers, nicotiana ( a little late for these) and some nigella. 
Actually self sown Nigella (Love in a Mist) are already in full bloom and 
looking lovely. I love the old name (Love in a Mist), it's so romantic!<br>
<br>
 12/05/11<br>
<br>
 Last year I was too busy taming the jungle that was my 
overgrown allotment, to have time to attend to things like netting fruit. 
Consequently I was left with two gooseberries and a handful of redcurrants. 
Well the jungle is now tame enough for me to attend to details. With today's 
Moon in Virgo, a sign most associated with detail, I created two fruit cages. 
This year's crop is mine.<br>
<br>
 11/05/11<br>
<br>
 Next week, I'll be 
unable to attend to any gardening due to a very busy schedule. Thankfully, with 
the Moon in Virgo there are many jobs which can be done. Virgo is the most 
useful sign for gardeners. This is a sign of descending energy, so although the 
Moon is still Waxing, I felt it was good enough to plant the rest of my 
shallots and onions. Happily the beds alloted for my onions, were already 
prepared a couple of months ago so there was no battle to be done with couch 
grass. Just a bit of weeding and they settled in nicely.<br>
<br>
 Keeping on 
top of the weeds at this time of year is crucial. My plot was a jungle of 
brambles, bindweed and couch grass only a year ago. It's hard to believe now, 
but I'm constantly reminded of this by bindweed and bramble shoots poking out 
their heads all over. They don't stand a chance!!!<br>
<br>
 10/05/11<br>
<br>
 
Well I knew the Moon in Leo was going to be busy... I didn't manage to get 
everything done yesterday so today saw me spend a very long time on my 
allotment planting peas. This is not a difficult job, albeit fiddly because of 
having to provide steaks for each plant. However, the beds in which I planted 
my peas were over-run with one of the many banes of an allotment holder' s 
life- couch grass. This meant that I had to spend rather a long time digging it 
out before planting. Happily it's all done and I look forward to a crop- maybe 
in a month's time.<br>
<br>
 9/05/11<br>
<br>
 This is going to be a busy day. 
Fire moons are good for dealing with fruit and this is a Waxing Moon so good 
for planting. I'm sowing more peas, beans, squashes and trying out watermelons 
too. Last year didn't work out for watermelons so my fingers are crossed this 
year!<br>
<br>
 I'm also pricking out sweet corn and more tomatoes. Last year I 
was too late planting sweetcorn to get a good crop so again I'm really hoping 
things will be different this year. As for my beans, well they're looking like 
I had Jack's magic bean. If they reach the sky, I hope there isn't a giant up 
there!<br>
<br>
 I'm also going to give my fig a new home today. It has 
outgrown its pot. I meant to do that when the Moon was last in Leo but ran out 
of time. I need to do the same for my cranberry. So a very busy day ahead! The 
nice thing is, that if I run out of time, there's also tomorrow!<br>
<br>
 
7/05/11<br>
<br>
 Watering the garden needs to be carefully judged. Water too 
much and plants become dependant on water on the surface. They don't develop 
deep roots which makes them more vulnerable during droughts. So a happy medium 
is needed. Watering on Waning Water Moons is usually enough if necessary. 
However, during dry periods, I also water on Waxing Moons. This means that 
everything is soaked about once a week. However, care is needed with young 
seedlings like peas and beans which do not yet have developed root systems. 
These may need watering more frequently if the weather is dry.<br>
<br>
 So 
today has been a day for watering the allotment, all container plants, 
seedlings and house plants. Happily it did rain this morning, but not enough. 
With any luck we will get some more so all will be well for another week.<br>

<br> 6/05/11<br>
<br>
It has been one of those days with too much to do in too 
little time. Pricking out seedlings is an act of real patience as rushing means 
delicate seedlings are lost. So I had to forget the clock ticking as I pricked 
out Aquilegias, Cauliflower, Purple Sprouting Broccoli, Statice, Pinks, 
Chamomile, Alyssum, and Borage. An easier job was the planting of Sweet Cicely. 
I've never grown this before but it is supposed to have lots of useful 
qualities which I look forward to experimenting with. My Angelica is massive! 
The winds actually blew it over, but I've staked it now and it is still very 
statuesque. I didn't get the chance to cut its stems to crystallising but will 
try to do that when the Moon is Waning in Aquarius as that will be a better 
time to do it anyway. Sadly the clock's ticking meant that I didn't get to sow 
any of the seeds I wanted to sow today. But happily the Moon will still be 
Waxing when it goes into Libra next week. There's usually a second chance for 
most things.<br>

 One of my compost bins has been 
sitting in the shed for about two months. You may wonder why, but that is 
because in high winds, it has been taking flight and landing in neighbouring 
allotments. Today, with the Moon in Taurus, I decided to turn my attention to 
compost. This meant clearing the patch where it belonged of weeds, and then 
digging a small circle into which to push it and secure it. The thing is that 
today is especially windy again and so this proved to be a challenging job. 
Still it is done and already half full of weeds!!!<br>
<br>
 I also sowed more 
parsnips, carrots, salsify, beetroot, celeriac and spring onions. I do hope the 
slugs leave some parsnips for me this time!<br>
<br>
1/05/11<br>
<br>
As the 
Moon is still Waning and in Aries, today I fed the cherry, pear, apple, peach, 
nectarine and plum trees. The strawberries got a feed too as did the 
raspberries, the blueberries and cranberries. Any fruit trees or shrubs which 
are either in blossom or which have flowered and are now forming fruit, now 
need a feed. There is still a little daylight left, so if you haven't done it 
yet, there's still time.<br>
<br>
 30/04/11<br>
<br>
The Moon is now in Aries. 
This is a Fire sign and so there is a link with fruit. However as the Moon is 
waning, the best job will be pruning. So once again, I noticed that some of my 
raspberries have dead wood which I pruned out. The new canes are also quite 
tall now and needed staking. So all in all a quiet day in terms of gardening, 
but these days are just right for enjoyment!<br>
<br>
 29/04/11<br>
<br>
More 
seed sowing today. Dill as my first batch succombed to scorching from the Sun 
in the greenhouse which I forgot to ventilate. Oops! More lettuce, coriander 
and cabbages. I decided not to prick out the seedlings I planted when the Moon 
was in Scorpio as they were too small.<br>
<br>
 I tried to water the allotment 
today but found that rodents had chewed through my hose pipe! I found it in 
three pieces!<br>
<br>
 26/04/11<br>
<br>
Today the Moon is in Pisces. First 
job on the list is to water the garden, the houseplants and the allotment. This 
is all I have time for today. Tomorrow there will be more seed sowing.<br>
<br>

 25/04/11<br>

Aquarius, is not a sign for gardening, so usually this is a 
Moon for enjoying the garden. Today though, I took advantage of the fact that 
the Moon is waning in an Air Sign. So I deadheaded my bulbs- tulips, daffodils, 
hyacinths and Irises. But I also did another important job. My fuchsias were 
hit hard by the winter. They were over ten years old, so I guess they were more 
vulnerable. In fact I was surprised that they survived the previous winter's 
harsh spell. I've lost two, and I removed their twiggy remains; but I was very 
happy to notice new growth coming from the base of the third. So I cut off the 
dead branches to allow the new life to come through. This is truly what spring 
is all about!!<br>
<br>

Thunderstorms yesterday evening meant 
that my potatoes had to wait until this morning to be planted. True to 
Capricorn rather than having a lazy Easter morning in bed, I was planting my 
potatoes. I also planted more shallots and onions. It was lovely to be in the 
sunshine doing this. I remember last year, planting onions one afternoon after 
work, being very cold and looking anxiously at a sky threatening to pour with 
rain. Today was much more pleasant. And I was rewarded when I got home, with 
some blossom on my Nectarine tree! It turned out to be the perfect Easter 
morning!<br>
<br>
 22/04/11<br>
<br>
It was great to be on Jeni Barnett's show 
on Radio London. Thought it was hilarious to be called a 'fierce Astrologer' 
and later to be referred to as the 'lunar lady'! Such fun!<br>
<br>
 Coming 
home was less fun though as I had to dig over a large area of the allotment 
again in very hot sun. Still it's all ready for the last of the potatoes which 
didn't get to go in last time. A Moon in Capricorn is perfect- an Earth Moon 
for roots and a Waning Moon also good for roots! I ran out of time today but 
tomorrow the Moon will still be in Capricorn. The hardest part is done. Of 
course there is another Capricorn link to this and that is that this is the 
sign most associated with hard work!<br>
<br>
21/04/11<br>
<br>
Like most 
people, I've been cooped up indoors all day but am now looking forward to some 
time on the allotment. Not allot that needs to be done as the Moon is Waning 
and in Sagittarius. This is not the best time to deal with fruit. But I missed 
a raspberry bush when I was pruning and it has some dead wood on it, so I'll 
attend to that today. Then I think I'll net some more of the fruit to keep the 
birds away. Quiet days in the garden are good days to do little jobs. Then 
again I might just sit and listen to the birds!<br>
<br>
 20/04/11<br>
<br>
The 
sun is shining again today. I don't remember an April like this for a very long 
time. Winter arrived early last year. Frosts in October and snow by the end of 
November. It feels as though summer has begun very early too. Although last 
night I dreamt that I'd woken up to snow in July. I still feel my profound 
shock! Thank God it was a dream. Having said that, it clearly shows my unease 
over unseasonal weather, even though the sun is shining, with the weirdness of 
our weather, we could yet see frosts before June!<br>
<br>
 On a much more 
cheerful note, the Moon today is in Sagittarius which means that it's a day for 
focusing on fruit. As it's a Waning Moon though, there isn't much to do. Waning 
Moons are good for pruning, so if there is any fruit pruning to be done, today 
and tomorrow are good days for it. I'm going to feed my apples, strawberries, 
pear, peach and cherry trees. Waning Moons are good for feeding as they ground 
is more absorbant. One of my students kindly brought some woodash he's 
collected from his wood burning stove, so I can use that to feed the fruit on 
the allotment.<br>
<br>
 I'm now happier about my Nectarine tree too. It's 
leaves are finally beginning to unfurl. I had begun to grow impatient and a 
little worried that it might be dead! The peach already has tiny peaches 
forming and this one has only just begun to wake from its winter slumber. I 
don't think there will be any nectarines though as there is no blossom. It's 
only its first year so I'm ok with that. I'm just glad it's alive. The Moon is 
indeed in Sagittarius, things are looking up!<br>
<br>
 19/04/11<br>
<br>
The 
Moon is now waning. During this phase, the earth is more absorbant. So I took 
advantage of the fact that the Moon has been in Scorpio today and watered the 
Allotment. Spring has been very dry here and the ground is hard. So I've 
watered again today. I won't be watering again until next week. If it rains, I 
won't need to.<br>
<br>
 Lots of seed was sown, coriander, dill and other herbs 
as well as cabbage. I'll need to keep the slugs off. They seem to love cabbage 
and coriander! So I've got them covered with mini cloches.<br>
<br>
<br>
 
18/04/11<br>
<br>
A beautiful day today but there is a price to pay for this 
glorious spring we've been enjoying. The ground is very hard and so today for 
the first time, I've watered the garden and allotment. The deluge will 
undoubtedly be with us soon- probably just in time for my birthday!<br>
<br>
 
16/04/11<br>
<br>
I had planned to plant my honeysuckle today but ran out of 
time. The good thing is that tomorrow the Moon will still be Waxing in Libra, 
so if like me you didn't get the chance to work in the garden, there's always 
tomorrow.<br>
 A waxing Moon in Libra is perfect for sowing flower seeds, 
pricking out flower seedlings and planting flowers. Remember that this includes 
flowering vegetables too.<br>
 This is something to look forward to tomorrow.
<br> <br>
 15/04/11<br>
<br>
If you've finished all your jobs for the Moon in 
Virgo, yesterday, today is a day to enjoy the garden. Although, Virgo being a 
working sign, I'm sure you'll find something that needs doing.<br>
<br>
 
14/01/11<br>
<br>
The Moon has gone into Virgo today. It is waxing so it's not 
an ideal time for dealing with your root vegetables. But Virgo is a forgiving 
Moon for gardeners. All manner of jobs work out well during this Moon, so I'm 
chancing putting in my potatoes, onions and shallots. The latter were started 
off in trays and just need to be put into the ground. This way they are big 
enough to resist the attention of the pigeon population. The potatoes are more 
than ready to go in, having been chitted and I really don't think they could 
wait for the Waning Moon in Capricorn. So in they will go, with my fingers 
firmly crossed.<br>
<br>
 13/01/11<br>
<br>
 More fruit went in today. I sowed 
courgettes, french, borlotti and runner beans as well as pumpkins and cobnut 
squash. These are all indoors of course as it's still too cold at night for 
them to be out. If you've missed this chance, don't worry, there is still 
plenty of time as you can sow the seeds in May. By then even the beans can be 
sown outdoors. Just look out for the next Moon in Leo, as it will be waxing in 
fire.<br>
<br>
 The apple blossom is exquisite. The cherry and pear have 
finished so now they need feeding as they are in containers. The peach is still 
indoors and that needed a feed too. you can already see the little peaches 
forming on it. I just cant wait!!!<br>
<br>
 12/04/11<br>
<br>
A busy gardening 
day today.&nbsp; This is a Waxing Moon in Leo. So perfect for dealing with all 
fruit matters. Broadbeans are to be planted. They're looking big and healthy so 
should be able to cope with attention from the slug population.<br>
<br>
 
Tomatoes, sweet pepper and okra, pea seedlings are looking big enough to be 
pricked out.<br>
<br>
 I'll be sowing more tomato seeds along with more peas. 
<br> <br>
 I also have a fig and a cranberry that need to be potted on.<br>
<br>
 So much to do that I'd better get started. I'm glad it's sunny.<br>
<br>
 
11/04/11<br>
<br>
Today is a good day to enjoy the garden. Water Moons are 
foliage days which means leaf vegetables like lettuce and herbs but it's a 
waxing Moon, so there is not a lot to do. Water your house plants and any 
container plants in the garden that might be in need. Seedlings in pots could 
also use a drink.<br>
<br>
 9/04/11<br>
<br>
What do snails prefer parsnips or 
carrots? During a trial in my garden ( a trial that I did not give consent to) 
the favourite appears to be parsnips. A seed tray containing half parsnips and 
half carrots, has all the carrots left and all the parsnips gone!!! They know 
what they like!<br>
<br>
 I know what I like too and took advantage of the Moon 
in Gemini to plant some Lavender and a couple of Japonese Anemones.<br>
&nbsp;
<br> 7/04/11<br>
<br>
Another glorious day!!! This time though the Moon has 
been in Gemini. As it's a Waxing Moon in an Air sign it's a good day to attend 
to flowers. The twelve signs also have another property- they are Ascending or 
Descending in energy. This relates to the time of year. Winter signs, signs 
related to the time after the winter solstice and before the summer solstice 
are signs of Ascending energy. Gemini is approaching the Summer Solstice so is 
considered to have Descending energy. This is useful as it encourages strong 
root growth. So the Waxing properties of the Moon encourage growth above ground 
and the Descending energy encourages healthy roots. This made it an ideal day 
to sow flower seeds. This included purple sprouting broccoli and cauliflower. 
Although we think of these as vegetables what we eat are the plants flowers. 
Other sowings included hardy annual- statice and alyssum as well as hardy 
perennial- dianthus. I can't wait to pick the flowers and have that sweet scent 
in the house.<br>
<br>
6/04/11<br>
<br>
What a glorious sunny day!!! The Moon 
is still in Taurus so it's a good day to tend to the compost. I'll just check 
to see all is as it should be. Then I'll start to prepare the bed for the 
potatoes which will go in when the Moon's in Virgo. That will be quite enough 
for today.<br>
<br>
 5/04/11<br>
<br>
The rain is keeping me off the allotment 
this morning but there is a little job that needs doing. Ideally, I would have 
done it when the Moon was last in Capricorn but I missed my chance. I would 
normally wait for the next time the Moon is waning on an Earth Moon but I'm 
concerned that I'll be too late. So as the Moon is in Taurus, (an Earth sign), 
today is the day. I think it will be ok because the aim of chitting is for the 
potatoes to start developing buds and I think a Waxing Moon may actually speed 
this up. Given that I'm late, this could be a good thing. Planting will be done 
at a more ideal time. Fingers crossed it will all be well!<br>
<br>
4/04/11<br>

Yesterday was the New Moon so the Moon is now waxing. The rule is that when the 
Moon is waxing we deal with plants above ground, the exception being leaf 
vegetables. Waxing Moons encourage fast growth and vigour which is why we deal 
with leaf vegetables and herbs on a Waning Moon. The prevents them from growing 
so fast that they bolt (produce flowers too quickly and go to seed).<br>
 As 
the Moon is in Aries and is now Waxing, this is a good day to attend to your 
fruit. I've noticed that all my current bushes are now flowering and have 
decided that this will be a good day to net them to prevent bird damage. Last 
year I was too busy to do this and lost all my blackcurrants to the birds. The 
annoying thing is that my neighbour's currant bushes were left intact. Mine 
were obviously tastier!!! <br>
