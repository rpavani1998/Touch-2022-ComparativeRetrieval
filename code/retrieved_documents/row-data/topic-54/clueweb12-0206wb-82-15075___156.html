<p><b>Town's sanitation standard slips; improvement mandated</b></p> 
<p><b>By Tess Noel Baker</b></p> 
<p><b>Staff Writer</b></p> 
<p>The Pagosa Springs General Sanitation District faces a rather expensive 
future - a future that will require compliance to stricter standards for 
wastewater treatment and necessitate several improvements to the treatment 
plant.</p> 
<p>That means a rate study that covers the needs of the district for now and 
the future.</p> 
<p>Tuesday, the district board, made up of the same members as the Town 
Council, reviewed a &quot;notice of significant noncompliance,&quot; received 
from the state March 6.</p> 
<p>According to the notice, monthly testing from February 2003 to November 
2003 revealed the district had reported 10 results that exceeded permit 
conditions. These involved outflow limitations for ammonia, total residual 
chlorine, dissolved oxygen and fecal coliform.</p> 
<p>Town Administrator Mark Garcia said because each violation was addressed 
with the state as it came up, the letter came as a bit of a surprise 
-&nbsp;especially the part on enforcement. That section reads, &quot;Should 
enforcement action be pursued, it will include the imposition of civil 
penalties of up to $10,000 per day of violation.&quot;</p> 
<p>The town was required to respond by March 20 detailing how violations would 
be prevented in the future. That deadline was extended to April 7.</p> 
<p>Garcia said Patrick O'Brien of Briliam Engineering had been retained to 
help the town with a two-phase plan for compliance. The first phase, to be 
completed by October, would focus on improvements to the aeration system. In 
the second phase, the plant's chlorination system would be upgraded to use 
ultraviolet light.</p> 
<p>Garcia said the plant has never been able to secure a permanent permit from 
the state. For six years, it has operated under an amended temporary permit, 
and a permanent one may have to wait until new standards for treatment take 
effect. </p> 
<p>But the bottom line is the issue. To complete these projects and others 
lists on a five-year capital improvement plan, the district will need more 
money. And that will probably mean a rate hike.</p> 
<p>Even with grants, Garcia said, which could come from either state or 
federal sources, matching funds will be needed.</p> 
<p>&quot;The 160 east project really put a dent in our revenues,&quot; he 
said. That project, extending the sewer line three miles east of downtown, was 
completed last year.</p> 
<p>The board voted Tuesday to hire a consulting firm to complete a rate study. 
Several board members directed Garcia to ensure the study covers not only what 
other sanitation districts are charging, but how much will be needed to 
complete the capital improvement projects necessary to bring the district into 
compliance.</p> 
<p>&quot;It seems to me we need to start with the costs and work back from 
there,&quot; board member Darrel Cotton said, adding that the district needs a 
10-year plan, not a rate study to tell them what the neighbors were up too.</p> 
<p>Garcia and district supervisor Phil Starks said the consultants will do 
just that.</p> 
<p>The five-year capital improvement plan presented to the sanitation district 
board outlined an estimated $1.7 million in projects. This includes three 
sections of line replacements as well as upgrades to the treatment plant.</p> 
<p>Garcia said figures are rough estimates. Actual costs may differ.</p> 
<p>Right now, town staff is focused on finding funding for the immediate 
concern - a better aeration system. The equipment alone runs $138,000. Add in 
the cost of labor and installation and it will probably rise near $200,000.</p>

<p><b>County faces $2.58 million airport crisis</b></p> 
<p><b>By Tom Carosello</b></p> 
<p><b>Staff Writer </b></p> 
<p>&quot;I'm sick to my stomach about this.&quot; </p> 
<p>Such were the sentiments of Mamie Lynch, chairman of the Archuleta County 
Board of Commissioners, after reviewing documents Tuesday indicating the county 
faces a potential $2.58 million funding shortfall for the continuance of 
improvements to Stevens Field.</p> 
<p>Lynch's comment came on the heels of a presentation by Ken Fox, who was 
hired to oversee operations at Stevens Field on a temporary basis after former 
airport manager Tim Smith departed in late February to accept a similar 
position in Fort Collins.</p> 
<p>Reiterating information provided in a cost-estimate memo to the board, Fox 
outlined the county's responsibility for construction of a new, fixed-base 
operations facility and relocation/replacement of eight box hangars and several 
fuel-related structures.</p> 
<p>The issue Tuesday concerned which aspects of those requirements were 
anticipated - financially - and which were not.</p> 
<p>Apparently, many were not.</p> 
<p>However, the fulfillment of the obligations, said Fox, is necessary under 
contract agreements struck between the county and Federal Aviation 
Administration - contracts that have provided over $9 million in federal grant 
funding for a series of upgrades to Stevens Field that were initiated in the 
'90s. </p> 
<p>In summary, the county must comply with the provisions and general 
timelines in the agreements or risk forfeiting eligibility for future funding, 
and, perhaps, the payback of millions in resulting funds and revenues.</p> 
<p>According to Fox, under previously approved contracts, the development of 
the midfield terminal area is the next step in the improvement process.</p> 
<p>As stated in Fox's memo, &quot;this means that midfield infrastructure, the 
hangar construction and the relocation of the fuel farm must be completed by 
the time the runway is completed ... estimated by October this year ... only 
six months from now.&quot;</p> 
<p>Preliminary cost estimates for the slate of tasks amount to just over $3.2 
million, though roughly $640,000 of that amount could be carried by FAA 
&quot;match funding.&quot;</p> 
<p>The balance, however, falls to the county -&nbsp;costs that could be 
adjusted downward, but expenses that were apparently unexpected until recently, 
and therefore not considered in this year's budget.</p> 
<p>The bulk of the price tag relates to providing a new structure to house 
fixed-base operations, a notion that dominated the majority of discussion this 
week.</p> 
<p>Questions concerning the fate of the current fixed-base facility, Nick's 
Hangar, have existed since at least the fall of 2002.</p> 
<p>According to the minutes of the Oct. 1 board meeting that year, Energy and 
Engine Technology, a corporation pursuing a fixed-base operation contract with 
the county, &quot;wanted assurance the county would pay for relocation costs 
should it become necessary to move or tear down Nick's Hangar.&quot;</p> 
<p>Furthermore, &quot;A part of Nick's Hangar protruded into the object-free 
zone, which the (FAA) guidelines prohibit. The options of relocation and 
reconstruction of a new building were discussed along with provisions for 
renegotiation of lease terms should the county construct a new building.&quot;
</p> 
<p>Speculation surrounding a pending FAA decision on such options at that time 
included the possibility of razing Nick's Hangar and building a new one, moving 
it, or grandfathering it in at it's present location and building an additional 
new hangar.</p> 
<p>Where the specifics of the FAA's eventual decision and corresponding 
language in subsequent contacts became lost in translation, at this point, 
remains somewhat unclear. </p> 
<p>Nevertheless, while details were not given Tuesday concerning exactly how 
the current situation came to be, some degree of insight was offered.</p> 
<p>To that effect, &quot;Much of this came about from a leap of faith ... that 
we could use the existing building as the terminal,&quot; said Commissioner 
Bill Downey after indicating he is &quot;very disappointed in having the 
additional expenditures.&quot; </p> 
<p>Likewise, &quot;This is an expense we weren't counting on,&quot; added 
Commissioner Alden Ecker.</p> 
<p>Though she indicated she believes the project will benefit the public in 
the long run, &quot;I have to feel the taxpayers of the county have been 
cheated,&quot; said Lynch.</p> 
<p>&quot;Because they're the ones that have to pay this bill back,&quot; she 
added. &quot;But I feel there is no choice; we have to do it.&quot;</p> 
<p>In response, &quot;Everything is happening at once, I recognize that and I 
apologize for that,&quot; said Bill Steele, county administrator. &quot;But we 
have to proceed.&quot;</p> 
<p>As a result, the board unanimously passed a three-part motion aimed at 
keeping the project on track.</p> 
<p>The first part of the motion authorized the pursuit of a $2.5 million loan 
from the State Infrastructure Bank - a loan, if granted, that is expected to be 
paid back over a 10-year span at roughly 4-percent interest.</p> 
<p>The second portion of the motion authorized administration to pursue the 
acquisition of a steel building that will serve as the new, fixed-base 
operation facility.</p> 
<p>The last part of the motion authorized an expenditure from the General Fund 
- not to exceed $90,000 - to cover down payments on the acquisition of steel 
for construction of the fixed-base facility and new fuel storage structures.</p>
<p>Cathie Wilson, county finance director, explained that an expenditure from 
the General Fund is necessary in this case because, &quot;The Airport Fund 
doesn't have the cash, I can tell you right now.&quot;</p> 
<p>In response to board questions regarding how the expenditure will affect 
the county's bottom line, &quot;I can't answer that solid, right now,&quot; 
said Wilson, though she added county revenue collections through the early part 
of this year are the highest since 1998 and &quot;look much better than they 
have been.&quot;</p> 
<p>Further discussion conducted during the public-comment portion of the 
meeting included the possibility of resurrecting an &quot;airport advisory 
committee.&quot;</p> 
<p>The reestablishment of such a committee, said one member of the public in 
attendance, may help prevent similar obstacles.</p> 
<p>The board acknowledged the notion might be a worthwhile addition to future 
agendas, though Steele stated he is generally against the concept, indicating 
the current predicament, in part, is the result &quot;of actions taken&quot; by 
the former airport advisory.</p> 
<p>Known as the Airport Authority, the committee was created in 1991 and 
eventually dissolved after a unanimous vote by the commissioners in late 2002.
</p> 
<p>In response to some final questions, Steele said the recent developments, 
specifically those related to Nick's Hangar, are &quot;a very, very complex 
topic.&quot;</p> 
<p>In addition, &quot;It's been a hard animal to chase, sometimes,&quot; said 
Steele, adding the hangar will be retained, but, according to FAA regulations, 
cannot be utilized as a hangar or fixed-base facility.</p> 
<p>With regard to whether or not the county was aware of its potential 
responsibility for other arrangements, &quot;Did we recognize that before - yes 
- but I don't think we were necessarily sure we had to do that,&quot; said 
Steele.</p> 
<p>&quot;Now, we know we do,&quot; he concluded. </p>

<p><b>EMS accreditation process outlined</b></p> 
<p><b>By Tess Noel Baker</b></p> 
<p><b>Staff Writer</b></p> 
<p>&quot;I feel like the board is defensive about this and this is not 
something we need to be defensive about.&quot; </p> 
<p>That was one of the comments made by Upper San Juan Health Service District 
Director Ken Morrison following the approval of an outline of standard 
operating procedure to be written for EMS.</p> 
<p>The outline was approved unanimously, but only after many questions from 
the board and the public. It was one of several topics met with a barrage of 
questions at the regular board meeting March 25.</p> 
<p>Earlier in the meeting, an audience member observed that the board and 
administration seemed to be setting up a series of &quot;smoke screens.&quot;
</p> 
<p>Morrison agreed, saying it was time for the board and the staff to focus on 
explaining issues more clearly and providing information further in advance of 
a vote to give board members a chance to understand what was before them.</p> 
<p>District Executive Director Dee Jackson said the list of index topics 
submitted for approval came from requirements necessary to meet the Commission 
on Accreditation for Ambulance Service standards.</p> 
<p>Kathy Saley, public relations coordinator, said the district has been 
working diligently to put the necessary procedures in place to achieve 
accreditation because acceptance would mean the district had met the &quot;gold 
standard&quot; of patient care. </p> 
<p>&quot;Who oversees the final draft of the procedures?&quot; board member 
Dean Sanna asked.</p> 
<p>&quot;I do,&quot; Jackson said, adding that it is the job of the board to 
set policy, whereas it is her job to write the procedures to put policy into 
effect. After several more questions, Jackson said her role in approving the 
final copy would be more of an editing function. The three paramedic shift 
supervisors and physician advisor Dr. Dan Hepburn would be tasked with writing 
the procedures.</p> 
<p>Larry Escude, a staff-member at EMS, asked if the EMTs would have a chance 
to review the standard operating procedures prior to approval.</p> 
<p>District Chairman Charles Hawkins said that would be determined by the 
supervisors and Hepburn.</p> 
<p>Saley said the accreditation procedure required buy-in by all of the EMTs 
before approval could be given.</p> 
<p>Other questions related to the accreditation agency, out of Glenview, Ill.
</p> 
<p>According to the group's Web site, the Commission on Accreditation of 
Ambulance Services was incorporated in 1990. It offers a three-year 
accreditation based on performance in an on-site review and an off-site review. 
A panel of commissioners, representing health care, law and business, 
determines whether an organization can be accredited.</p> 
<p>The CAAS board of directors includes representatives from: the American 
Ambulance Association, American College of Emergency Physicians, International 
Association of Fire Chiefs, National Association of EMS Physicians, National 
Association of EMTs and the National Association of State EMS Directors. The 
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is an additional liaison.</p> 
<p>Nationwide, 87 ambulance services have received accreditation by CAAS, 
including three in Colorado - American Medical Response in Colorado Springs, 
Eagle County Ambulance District, Edwards and Northglenn Ambulances, Inc. The 
Albuquerque Ambulance Service is also CAAS accredited.</p> 
<p>According to the Web site information, cost for the accreditation is $100 
for the application package, plus $3,500 for an ambulance service the size of 
Pagosa's. Another $5,000-$6,000 deposit is due at the time of application for 
reviewer fees. This includes travel and per diem for the on-site review.</p> 
<p>The index of standard operating procedures, which ended up being passed 
unanimously, is part of the district's preparation for application.</p> 
<p>Jackson said the policies are being written now using a template provided 
by an already CAAS-accredited agency in Colorado. About half have been 
completed. The goal is to have site reviewers come out in May for a preliminary 
review.</p> 
<p>Because the district's policies are so new, she said, the accreditation 
company might only issue provisional approval and then return after a year to 
make sure the district is following its policies and it's quality assurance 
program. </p>

<p><b>A record 210,819 utilized slopes of Wolf Creek Ski Area this season</b>
</p> 
<p><b>By Tom Carosello</b></p> 
<p><b>Staff Writer </b></p> 
<p>Did big winter snows across Pagosa Country equate to big numbers for the 
2003-2004 ski season?</p> 
<p>The answer, according to statistics provided by Wolf Creek Ski Area, is a 
definite &quot;yes.&quot;</p> 
<p>In short, &quot;Basically, we had our best year ever,&quot; said Roseanne 
Haidorfer-Pitcher, Wolf Creek sales and marketing manager.</p> 
<p>According to Haidorfer-Pitcher, a record 210,819 skiers tested Wolf Creek's 
1,600 acres of terrain between Nov. 7 (opening day) and Sunday, the area's 
final day of spring operation.</p> 
<p>That figure eclipses the area's previous high mark of 202,053 recorded 
during the 1998-1999 ski season, and reflects an increase of over 14 percent 
when compared to last year's total of 183,907.</p> 
<p>In addition to tallying a new all-time high in season totals, said 
Haidorfer-Pitcher, Wolf Creek set single-day attendance records on consecutive 
days in mid-March.</p> 
<p>&quot;Spring break started out a little slower than we anticipated - still 
good, but fewer numbers than last year,&quot; said Haidorfer-Pitcher.</p> 
<p>&quot;Then came the third week of March and it seemed like everybody 
decided to come up to the mountain at once,&quot; she added.</p> 
<p>Despite unseasonably high temperatures during that week, 5,586 skiers 
flocked to the slopes March 15, narrowly breaking the area's prior, single-day 
attendance record of 5,585 by a margin of one.</p> 
<p>The benchmark was short-lived; the following day's total of 5,647 surpassed 
the mark to claim the top spot in the record books.</p> 
<p>Although the area was in the midst of a dry spell with respect to snowfall, 
Haidorfer-Pitcher said springlike conditions during the two-day span enabled 
the record crowds to move about the area with little congestion.</p> 
<p>&quot;Normally everyone is kind of confined to the inside areas, but we had 
people eating outside on the picnic tables and we even opened a burger stand on 
the Alberta Lift,&quot; said Pitcher. &quot;The warm weather actually helped us 
accommodate everyone.&quot;</p> 
<p>Lastly, said Haidorfer-Pitcher, though nine inches of new snow recently 
boosted Wolf Creek's summit depth to 109 inches, Sunday's closing date is not 
viewed as premature since many people are already beginning to focus on summer 
activities. </p> 
<p>&quot;With all the warm weather we've been having, people just aren't 
thinking about skiing as much,&quot; said Pitcher, adding the area drew a 
combined total of roughly 1,600 people over the weekend.</p> 
<p>&quot;There's still a lot of snow, just not enough people to justify 
staying open, from an economic standpoint,&quot; said Haidorfer-Pitcher.</p> 
<p>&quot;But nobody's complaining,&quot; she concluded. &quot;We had 
outstanding support this season, and we owe a lot to our customers and 
employees for making this just a great all-around year.&quot;</p>

<p><b>April 30 deadline for heating aid applications</b></p> 
<p>Archuleta County residents wishing to receive heating assistance from the 
Low-income Energy Assistance Program (LEAP) must act quickly to meet the April 
30 deadline.</p> 
<p>If eligible, applicant households could receive up to $700 annually to help 
pay home heating bills.</p> 
<p>According to the county's Department of Social Services, which administers 
LEAP, over 350 households in the county have been approved this season for an 
average benefit of nearly $636.</p> 
<p>Households not approved since Nov. 1, 2003, may still receive a full 
2003-04 benefit, but they must apply and present proof of eligibility before 
the deadline.</p> 
<p>Households with gross incomes below 185 percent of the federal poverty 
level are eligible if they meet other program requirements.</p> 
<p>For example, a family of four grossing $2,836 during the month of March 
would meet the income requirement. The maximum allowable gross monthly income 
is determined by the number of household members, ranging from $1,384 for a 
single-person household to $4,773 for a household of eight.</p> 
<p>Anyone interested may call social services at 264-2182 for specific income 
guidelines or to request an application. Application forms and brochures 
explaining requirements are also available at the social services office at 551 
Hot Springs Blvd., 8 a.m.-4 p.m. Monday through Friday.</p> 
<p>Eligibility can only be determined after a competed application is 
submitted with proof of income and other information. Both homeowners and 
renters may qualify if they pay for heat, either directly to a utility company 
or as part of their rent.</p> 
<p>LEAP is a federally funded program receiving supplemental funding from the 
nonprofit Colorado Energy Assistance Foundation which, in turn, receives 
contributions from energy companies and utility customers which help protect 
the program from funding shortfalls when actual need exceeds projected costs.

<p><b>Pagosan violates probation, sentenced to six years</b></p> 
<p><b>By Tom Carosello</b></p> 
<p><b>Staff Writer </b></p> 
<p>A Pagosa Springs man convicted of sexual assault last year was resentenced 
to six years in prison Monday for an apparent parole violation.</p> 
<p>Scott Firth, 53, was handed the sentence after a March 26 probation 
revocation hearing in which Sixth District Court Judge Gregory Lyman ruled 
Firth had violated the conditions of his parole.</p> 
<p>Sixty days in the Archuleta County Jail, registration as a sex offender and 
electronic home monitoring were stipulations included as part of the probation 
given Firth last May after he pleaded guilty to an amended count of sexual 
assault on a child by one in a position of trust, a Class 4 felony.</p> 
<p>The case dates back nearly two years; Firth was arrested and booked on 
those charges July 19, 2002, after an arrest warrant was issued for him the 
previous day.</p> 
<p>According to court records, Firth's six-year sentence, which includes 
credit for 98 days served, is &quot;indeterminate,&quot; meaning he will be 
subject to reevaluation at the end of his sentence to determine if further 
incarceration is necessary.</p>

<p><b>Parallel parking approved for parts of Hot Springs Boulevard</b></p> 
<p><b>By Tess Noel Baker</b></p> 
<p><b>Staff Writer</b></p> 
<p>Three road projects are on the table in the Town of Pagosa Springs this 
year - Hot Springs Boulevard, Cemetery Road and upgrades on Talisman and 
Village drives and Pi&ntilde;on Causeway.</p> 
<p>Town Administrator Mark Garcia said the advertisement for bids on final 
curb, gutter and asphalt work on Hot Springs Boulevard are ready to go with one 
detail remaining.</p> 
<p>The striping.</p> 
<p>Garcia said the road width of the project was designed to accommodate 
either a center turn lane or on-street parallel parking slots. The council was 
tasked Tuesday with deciding how to dress the road to start.</p> 
<p>Their answer was to give both options a chance. The road will be striped 
for parallel parking on both sides from Spring Street south, adding 
approximately 70 spaces. The northern half of the road will keep the center 
turn lane configuration.</p>

parking at the Pagosa Springs Community Center,&quot; council member Stan Holt 
said, advocating the parallel parking on that portion.</p> 
<p>Council member Tony Simmons, sworn in along with Bill Whitbred and Holt 
earlier in the meeting, asked if parallel parking on Hot Springs Boulevard 
would lead to added congestion.</p> 
<p>Garcia said traffic on the road generally clears out once the Post Office 
closes for the evening, reducing the chances of congestion during evening 
events at the community center.</p> 
<p>The other two road improvements are joint town and county projects.</p> 
<p>Garcia said work on reconstruction of Talisman and Village drives and 
Pi&ntilde;on Causeway has resumed although the contractor has not been given an 
official notice to proceed. That will happen in the next several days depending 
on the weather patterns.</p> 
<p>Once they are given the notice, Garcia said, they will have 46 days to 
complete the project.</p> 
<p>The asphalt project planned for Cemetery Road, which was set to include 
resurfacing on the portion from 5th Street to Hilltop Cemetery, and paving the 
remainder of road to Bienvenido Circle, may have to be completed in two phases. 
Garcia said the design is complete, but utility, right of way and environmental 
agreements are pending on the non-paved portion.</p> 
<p>This project is funded in part by a state air quality grant.</p> 
<p>In other business, the council:</p> 
<p>-&nbsp;approved a letter outlining concerns and comments regarding the 
Village at Wolf Creek Subdivision, a proposal for a 2,000 unit residential and 
commercial project planned at the top of Wolf Creek Pass. The letter included 
requests for detailed economic and social impact studies, a traffic impact 
analysis for U.S. 160 and U.S. 84, the needs for affordable housing for 
employees of such a development and adequate engineering.</p> 
<p>Council members requested the letter be sent to Mineral County, Rio Grande 
County and the U.S. Forest Service.</p> 
<p>- approved $10,000 to retain consultants for a vision committee. The town 
has applied for a $60,000 Energy Impact Grant to help fund a comprehensive 
plan. The comprehensive plan is a requirement under the town's Home Rule 
Charter passed last year. Garcia estimated it would take about 18 months to put 
a comprehensive plan in place.</p> 
<p>- reviewed a draft ordinance of a smoking ban for public buildings within 
the Town of Pagosa Springs. The ordinance was provided, along with information 
on bans in other parts of the state, for information purposes only.</p> 
<p>A copy of the draft is available at www.townofpagosasprings.com. </p> 
<p>A public hearing will be scheduled May 4 to give business owners and 
residents a chance to voice their opinions on the issue.</p>

<p><b>Circus, rummage sale support center credo of family fun </b></p> 
<p><b>By Pauline Benetti</b></p> 
<p><b>Special to The SUN</b></p> 
<p>What could a rummage sale and a circus possibly have in common? </p> 
<p>Well, in Pagosa they have the community center in common. Both these events 
are coming up this month and both are sponsored by the community center. In 
addition, both are consistent with the mission of the community center - to 
offer the community useful services and family fun events.</p> 
<p>What could be more fun for the family than a circus? The fun and excitement 
begins early (8 a.m.) on April 15 with the set-up of the Big Top, accomplished 
with the strength of the great circus elephants.</p> 
<p>Later in the day the Carson &amp; Barnes Circus will offer two 
performances, 4:30 and 7:30 p.m. Spectators will be treated to a spectacular 
parade, acrobats and trapeze artists, clowns and performers from around the 
world along with lots of performing elephants, lions, camels, dogs and horses 
in five different rings.</p> 
<p>Advance tickets are $5 for kids 2-11 and $10 for adults. They can be bought 
at any bank in town plus the Shell Station, Shang-Hai Restaurant, Corner Store, 
Chamber of Commerce and the community center.</p> 
<p>Rummage sale</p> 
<p>Now the other part of the mission - offering useful services. What could be 
more useful than an indoor yard sale?</p> 
<p>This event gives us a good reason to open windows, shake out dust, clean 
out cupboards and closets, and just get rid of &quot;stuff&quot; that has been 
taking up space.</p> 
<p>Get rid of it by taking it down to the community center April 17 and 
putting a price tag on it. Chances are someone will find their treasure among 
your discards.</p> 
<p>For $10 you can have a table ($20 for two) upon which to display your wares 
10 a.m.-4 p.m. Come to the community center right away and reserve one (or two) 
of the best spots.</p> 
<p>For further information call the community center at 264-4152, Monday to 
Friday, 8 a.m.-5 p.m.</p>

<p><b>Hispanics a key part of the circus family</b></p> 
<p>With approximately 100 Hispanic employees from various countries, including 
Peru, Mexico, Argentina, Colombia and Brazil the Carson &amp; Barnes 5-Ring 
Circus is proud to honor their contribution to the 2004 edition.</p> 
<p>Hispanic performers, technicians, office workers and department heads 
provide the unique skills and talents vital to success of this unusual business.
</p> 
<p>Both Traci and Krystin Byrd, daughters of the circus owners, Barbara and 
Geary Byrd, have merged by marriage into this great Hispanic culture. Traci is 
married to Julio Cavallini, from a sixth-generation circus family from Peru and 
Kristin married Gustavo Parra from Mexico.</p> 
<p>Together, they represent the next generation of circus management. </p> 
<p>Various departments have long-term Hispanic employees in charge. </p> 
<p>Jaime Garcia from Mexico has been with Carson &amp; Barnes for more than 30 
years. As superintendent, Jaime makes sure the big show moves and the world's 
largest big top goes up on schedule.</p> 
<p>&quot;Many people say that it's the most amazing act of the show,&quot; 
Jaime says with a smile.</p> 
<p>Wardrobe manager Hernando &quot;Fichi&quot; Reyes from Colombia, is 
responsible for the hundreds of exotic and colorful costumes for the performers 
and animals. This year's edition will feature Spanish costumes in the opening 
aerial ballet and mid-show spectacular parade.</p> 
<p>Properties manager Luis Soto and his crew ensure that all props and 
equipment are in the right place at the right time - in the circus, lives 
depend on it.</p> 
<p>Martin Rivera and Yamina Huaman, cookhouse managers, are natives of Peru 
and responsible for feeding the crew of this international company.</p> 
<p>&quot;Catering to their tastes is a challenge I enjoy,&quot; Rivera said. 
&quot;It makes my job interesting and very rewarding.&quot;</p> 
<p>The circus is a small town that not only moves daily, but also generates 
its own electricity.</p> 
<p>Andrew Huaman of Peru is head of the electrical department.</p> 
<p>Carson &amp; Barnes Circus features more than 30 Hispanic performers, many 
of them following in family footsteps with generation after generation of 
circus performers.</p> 
<p>The cast of highly talented artists also includes performers from other 
countries around the globe and over 100 animals.</p> 
<p>Carson &amp; Barnes Circus will present two performances in Pagosa 
Springs&nbsp;- 4:30 and 7:30 p.m. - April 15 in a fund-raiser for the Pagosa 
Springs Community Center.</p> 
<p>Advance general admission tickets are available at the Shell Station, Bank 
of Colorado, The Corner Store, Wells Fargo Bank, the Chamber of Commerce, Bank 
of the San Juans, Pagosa Springs Community Center and Citizens Bank. Special 
prices are being offered or you may choose to go online and get your tickets at 
www.carsonbarnes circus.com.</p> 
<p>On circus day, advance general admission tickets can be upgraded to 
preferred seating for an additional charge.</p> 
<p>The circus will be presented in the open area between the community center 
and hot spring.</p>

<p><b>'Believe, Talk, Act' during Sexual Assault Awareness Month</b></p> 
<p><b>By Carmen Hubbs</b></p> 
<p><b>Special to The SUN</b></p> 
<p>Pagosa Springs Mayor Ross Aragon, with Archuleta County Commissioner Mamie 
Lynch, declared April Sexual Assault Awareness Month in Archuleta County and 
Pagosa Springs at a ceremony held April 1.</p> 
<p>To increase public attention of sexual assault and to encourage community 
member involvement, the Archuleta County Victim Assistance Program held the 
kickoff event in downtown Pagosa Springs.</p> 
<p>The mayor read a proclamation saying sexual assault affects everyone and 
that many citizens of Archuleta County are working to provide support for 
victims; citing the importance of raising awareness through education and 
prevention; and making a request for &quot;public support ... to work toward a 
society where all women, children and men can live in peace, free from violence 
and exploitation.&quot;</p> 
<p>As the proclamation ended, Commissioner Lynch raised an awareness flag 
encouraging all who read it to &quot;believe, talk, act&quot; to &quot;work to 
end sexual violence in our community - to believe that sexual assault is a 
communitywide problem; to talk about the issue in our homes, with friends, and 
in social groups; and to actively become a part of ending sexual violence.&quot;
</p> 
<p>Next, three students from Pagosa Springs High School displayed 72 smaller 
flags, representing 72 sexual assault victims served in Archuleta County during 
2003. The flags displayed images of children, women and men, demonstrating the 
many faces of victims.</p> 
<p>The flags were then &quot;planted&quot; around the Bell Tower Park to be 
flown throughout the month, honoring victims, while increasing awareness of the 
extent of sexual assault that exists in our community.</p> 
<p>As the ceremony ended, people lingered, humbled by the impact of the event. 
It is the hope that each day, as people see the many faces of victims, and are 
encouraged to &quot;Believe, Talk, Act&quot;, that the honoring of victims 
continues and personal awareness arises.</p> 
<p>April is Sexual Assault Awareness Month. What will you do?</p> 
<p>For more information on how you can get involved, contact the victim 
assistance program at 264-9075.</p>

<p><b>Few amendments made it into the Long Bill </b></p> 
<p><b>Rep. Larson's Report</b></p> 
<p>In even numbered years the budget bill (aka The Long Bill) is introduced in 
the House of Representatives first. HB04-1422 was distributed to the members 
March 30, and we were given the afternoon off (well most of us were, because 
one committee met) to dig into this 607-page document with its accompanying 217 
page narrative.</p> 
<p>Generally each caucus will meet and painstakingly pour over the budget 
looking for vulnerable funding that can be shifted to a program that a 
legislator particularly likes and perceives to be underfunded or at risk of 
being eliminated. This year the Republican caucus did things differently.</p> 
<p>On March 31 the Republicans met in their caucus, listened to our Joint 
Budget Committee (JBC) members explain the many nuances that led them to their 
revenue and spending assumptions and then we closed the budget ... all within a 
couple hours. One Western Slope member moved to close the budget explaining 
that after her eight years in the Legislature and years of sitting for 10-14 
hours dissecting every line item, headnote and footnote that we needed to do 
things differently. She said that through discussions with their colleagues and 
constituents members knew what they were looking for and could seek out the 
guidance of any of our excellent JBC staff if they have questions.</p> 
<p>An overwhelming &quot;sense of the caucus&quot; (under law caucuses cannot 
be binding) majority vote confirmed agreement. Leadership allowed a few more 
questions that were focused on understanding the overall picture and then we 
adjourned. Simple as that.</p> 
<p>The Democrat caucus continued to scour the budget all day Tuesday and part 
of Wednesday. When the house convened on Thursday afternoon to work on the 
budget in second reading, 65 amendments had been drafted for offering.</p> 
<p>Much to my surprise, the elimination of the derri&egrave;re and 
mind-numbing budget caucus process did not significantly impact the outcome. 
Members still drafted their amendments, we still debated them on the floor 
(some were debated ad nauseum) and the JBC members still fought to protect 
their good work. At the end of the day, few amendments made it into the Long 
Bill. The JBC's countless hours of work had essentially withstood any 
significant challenges and the bill is now on its way to the Senate.</p> 
<p>K-12 education, Medicaid caseload growth and prison growth eat up all 
revenue increases. But improved revenue projections and a one-time 
redistribution of tobacco funds (resulting in a $40 million transfer to the 
general fund) meant that with a few exceptions, most programs were allowed to 
receive at least last years funding level. Unfortunately two exceptions will 
particularly impact our region.</p> 
<p>Senior programs that provide meals, transportation and other services was 
cut by $2.5 million. This is on top of previous year cuts of $1.5 million. 
These cuts will directly impact our seniors by cutting already strapped 
nutrition programs. The house was only able to restore $500,000 to this line 
item.</p> 
<p>Field administrators in the Department of Human Services provide an 
important liaison connection to the counties. Elimination of these positions 
means reduced efficiencies, training and a host of other valuable services.</p> 
<p>It is now up to the Senate to try to restore funding. Sen. Isgar and I have 
suggested cuts to the governors office line items since the governor is sitting 
on approximately $22 million in federal flexible funds and he could use this 
&quot;slush&quot; fund to backfill the cuts. It would have been nice for those 
funds to have flowed to the Legislature for us to appropriate as stipulated 
under the law.</p> 
<p>Citizens should call the governor's office (303)866-2471 and ask the 
governor to fund these critical senior programs and not sit on that money in 
these critical times.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><b>As policy 'morphs,' solutions cause new problems </b></p> 
<p><b>Sen. Isgar's Report</b></p> 
<p>Even though this is my third year in the state Senate, I still find it 
remarkable how public policy can morph under political pressure.</p> 
<p>Such was the case last week with Senate Bill 189, which purportedly offered 
a solution to Colorado's funding crisis in higher education.</p> 
<p>I've addressed higher ed in previous columns and argued that the 
constitutional constraints imposed by TABOR and Amendment 23 have led us to 
balance our budget on the backs of our colleges and universities.</p> 
<p>This result has reflected poorly on our state's commitment to higher 
education and, in my view, undermined the state's economic recovery.</p> 
<p>The most immediate problem facing Colorado colleges is the insufficiency of 
state funding coupled with the inability to raise revenue.</p> 
<p>Under the state constitution, there is a limit to the amount of money state 
schools can bring in without it counting toward a TABOR refund. Hence, schools 
like the University of Colorado have lobbied for a way to exempt tuition 
increases from TABOR so they can maintain their institutions in times of 
declining state general fund support.</p> 
<p>Last year, the Legislature passed a bill to grant CU enterprise status to 
do just this, but it met the governor's veto. Reintroduced this year, SB 189 
also combines enterprise status for CU with a new voucher program for higher ed 
funding.</p> 
<p>The principle behind the voucher plan is to give TABOR the slip on a 
technicality. Instead, the argument goes, of funding state institutions of 
higher education, Colorado would provide stipends directly to in-state 
students, which they could use toward the cost of their education.</p> 
<p>In effect, the bill provides no new money, but only shifts the mechanism 
through which it is distributed in the hope that rerouting the money will 
exempt the schools from TABOR.</p> 
<p>However, the problem with this premise is the flimsiness of the link 
between the vouchers and the students. Students never see a check, and are only 
made aware of their stipend when it's counted toward their bill.</p> 
<p>There are already fears that Doug Bruce may sue the state to challenge the 
bill's constitutionality. In addition, there are objections to the fact that 
selected private schools will receive tax dollars at a time when we are having 
trouble funding our public schools.</p> 
<p>Ironically, if the vouchers are constitutional, we might make things worse 
for public higher education by creating a feeding frenzy among private schools. 
For example, affirming the idea that higher ed vouchers really aren't 
subsidizing state schools indirectly, there's no reason why a student shouldn't 
have a choice between any accredited school public or private. In other words, 
we are welcoming a challenge from any number of private schools that weren't 
earmarked for vouchers. Where do we draw the line?</p> 
<p>But more importantly, simply allowing schools to raise tuition only hurts 
the smaller colleges in our area when we start pricing potential students out 
of the market.</p> 
<p>If our goal is to provide any meaningful relief to higher education, the 
solution will have to come from a constitutional reform on the November ballot. 
I feel that anything else that doesn't create new money, or remove our 
structural fiscal problems, only sends the message that we're still thinking in 
the short-term and aren't putting enough energy into finding a solution with 
the voters.</p> 
<p>In the end, however, SB 189 passed the Senate 22-13 with my vote in 
opposition. The bill will now move on to the House.</p> 
<p>This week, the Senate will start work on the budget.</p> 
<p>My hope is to offer several amendments to reallocate some of the federal 
flexible funds and restore programs that were cut close to home. With any luck, 
we'll find some money for things like our area senior programs and local field 
administration for the Department of Human Services.</p>

<p><b>'Prepare Colorado' is Red Cross challenge to boost state safety</b></p> 
<p>The Colorado Chapter of the American Red Cross has released statistics from 
a random telephone survey conducted with 400 state households.</p> 
<p>According to a previous survey conducted by the Red Cross national office, 
60 percent of Americans are unprepared for a disaster of any description. 
However, nearly 90 percent of respondents to the Colorado survey find it 
imperative to know how to handle an emergency situation.</p> 
<p>Eighty percent of Coloradans also think it is important to have an 
emergency evacuation plan including an out-of-area contact and a place to meet 
away from home. However, only 50 percent reportedly have such a plan and only 
42 percent have emergency kits in their homes.</p> 
<p>The statistics for emergency preparedness are more positive for households 
with children that are found to be better prepared and more informed. 
Surprisingly enough, less than 20 percent of Coloradans reported they have been 
involved in any community effort related to disaster preparedness in the past 
few years.</p> 
<p>And, although many employers have created disaster plans and hired safety 
and security officers, only half of all Colorado employees are aware of a 
disaster plan at their workplace.</p> 
<p>The Colorado Red Cross survey further states that nearly a quarter of the 
state's households do not have anyone who is trained in first aid, CPR or other 
lifesaving skills. According to the survey, the American Red Cross comes to 
mind first and most often when Coloradans (i.e. families) think of 
organizations that help save lives and provide information on preparing for 
emergencies.</p> 
<p>&quot;The statistics are concerning,&quot; said Christine Benero, chief 
executive officer for the Mile High Chapter of the Red Cross. &quot;With some 
training, a little planning and preparation, we feel anyone can be better 
prepared for whatever emergency might arise.</p> 
<p>&quot;By following a few simple steps to be prepared, Coloradans can make 
Colorado the most prepared state in the nation for all types of emergencies 
from a near drowning or a heart attack to a home fire, major snow storm or the 
threat of wildfire.&quot;</p> 
<p>The Red Cross commissioned the survey as the preliminary step of the 
&quot;Prepare Colorado&quot; campaign being launched this month. It encourages 
individuals, families, businesses and communities to take five simple steps: 1, 
build a kit; 2, make a plan; 3, get trained; 4, volunteer; and 5, give blood.
</p> 
<p>Health and safety training coupled with disaster education including a line 
of emergency products make up &quot;Prepare Colorado.&quot;</p> 
<p>&quot;Our mission is to help people prevent, prepare for and respond to 
emergencies,&quot; said Benero. &quot;Many people are familiar with the 
reactive nature of our mission, responding to care for people impacted by 
disaster. With &quot;Prepare Colorado,&quot; we are hoping to show Coloradans 
that by being prepared and completing these five simple steps, everyone can 
minimize the potential destruction to property as well as injury and loss of 
life often associated with the smallest personal emergency to the largest 
communitywide disaster.&quot;</p>

<p><b>Exploring metaphors of Easter message</b></p> 
<p>At 10:30 a.m. April 11, program facilitator Mike Greene will lead a special 
Easter Sunday Meditation Service for the Pagosah Unitarian Universalist 
Fellowship.</p> 
<p>He will explore metaphors of Easter's message of renewal with four short 
meditative exercises from the sandbox of stress reduction modalities:</p> 
<p>- Progressive relaxation (experiencing physical tension and release)</p> 
<p>- Autogenics (working with the mind-body connection)</p> 
<p>- Open focus (opening the narrow doors of attention and perception)</p> 
<p>- Releasing (letting go of felt demands for control and change). </p> 
<p>The Fellowship is now meeting in its new permanent home in Unit 15, 
Greenbriar Plaza, on Greenbriar Drive, off North Pagosa Boulevard. Unit 15 is 
on the east (back) side of the commercial plaza.</p> 
<p>Turn east on Greenbriar Drive off North Pagosa by the fire station, then 
left into the parking lot and look for the big new sign.</p> 
<p>All are welcome.</p>

<p><b>Special to The PREVIEW </b></p> 
<p>All are invited to an Easter Breakfast 9-10:30 a.m. Sunday at Our Savior 
Lutheran Church and School, 56 Meadows Drive.</p> 
<p>The youth group will fix breakfast burritos - plain or smothered in your 
choice of red or green chile. The meal will be served in the school gym, which 
is adjacent to the church, and shares the same parking lot. Donations are 
welcome but not required.</p> 
<p>Holy Week services include a Maundy Thursday service at 7 p.m. today and a 
Good Friday service at 8 p.m. Friday.</p> 
<p>Maundy Thursday commemorates the night when Jesus instituted the Lord's 
Supper, with his disciples, immediately before his betrayal and trials by the 
Sanhedrin and the Roman authorities.</p> 
<p>The Good Friday service this year will once again be the traditional 
Tenebrae, the Service of Darkness. It is a time to reflect on His sacrifice and 
death in the stillness and quiet darkness.</p> 
<p>Due to daylight saving time, the service will be held at 8 p.m. to take 
advantage of the full darkness of that hour.</p> 
<p>The service ends with the church bell tolling 33 times, one time for each 
year of our Lord's life on earth.</p> 
<p>Holy Week concludes with two services on Easter morning, at 8 and 10:45 am 
(with the breakfast held between services). All are welcome as we join in 
celebrating the resurrection of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><b>Good Friday service slated</b></p> 
<p>The public is invited to a Holy Friday worship service led by youth at 
Community United Methodist Church at 8 p.m. April 9.</p> 
<p>Through drama, scripture and special music, the youth and adults will 
recount Christ's final hours prior to his triumphant resurrection. Music 
Director Melinda Baum said, &quot;Our hope is that by reminding ourselves of 
Christ's suffering, we will be more prepared for Sunday's joyous Easter 
celebration.&quot;</p> 
<p>Community United Methodist Church is located downtown one block North of

<p>Featured will be a stone soup supper, communion and time for personal and 
group prayer in the garden.</p> 
<p>Good Friday service will be at 8 p.m. with church youth presenting Christ's 
final hours. Although it will not be of the magnitude of &quot;The 
Passion,&quot; they will use drama, scripture and music in depiction of this 
event.</p> 
<p>A non-traditional worship service will be held in the church 8:15 a.m.

<p><b>Noted archeologist will address new Chimney Rock Interpretive Association
</b></p> 
<p><b>By Dahrl Henley</b></p> 
<p><b>Special to The PREVIEW</b></p> 
<p>Dr. Steven Lekson, curator of anthropology at the University Museum of 
Natural History in Boulder, will speak April 19 on the topic &quot;The Place of 
Chimney Rock in the larger Chaco World.&quot;</p> 
<p>Hosting his presentation will be the newly formed Chimney Rock Interpretive 
Association. The public is invited to the 7 p.m. meeting in the Parish Hall on 
Lewis Street.</p> 
<p>Dr. Lekson received his Ph.D. from the University of New Mexico and is a 
southwestern archaeologist who has led 18 expeditions in the Four Corners area. 
He is the author of two dozen books, and a frequent contributor to Archaeology 
and other magazines.</p> 
<p>The association, a nonprofit partner with Forest Service, operates the 
Chimney Rock Interpretive Program. Formerly the San Juan Mountains Association 
in Durango governed this program. Now the same volunteers operate the program 
from Pagosa Springs.</p> 
<p>&quot;The local volunteers in Pagosa Springs have always been the driving 
force, and provided the majority of the volunteer services that have made the 
program so successful,&quot; said long-time volunteer Ann Van Fossen.</p> 
<p>&quot;The only difference is that now we have the opportunity to make 
decisions locally in a way that will benefit the community as well as the 
association,&quot; she said. &quot;It is by far the most interesting and 
rewarding volunteer work I have ever done.&quot;</p> 
<p>The association serves nearly 11,000 visitors from all over the world each 
season on four two-hour walking tours each day, seven days a week from May 
through September. They also greet another 4,000 visitors at the visitor 
center. The program's operating funds come from tour fees, donations and sales 
at the gift shop.</p> 
<p>Each season the association provides free tours to local schools. Between 
300 and 500 elementary, middle, high and home school students, as well as 
scouting, other youth groups, and Indian cultural group students from northern 
New Mexico and southern Colorado communities visit each year.</p> 
<p>The association also hosts many special events including the Pueblo Indian 
dances, &quot;Life at Chimney Rock: A Festival of Crafts and Culture,&quot; 
full moon programs, and sunrise programs at the summer solstice and the 
autumnal equinox.</p> 
<p>&quot;Obviously it takes a large number of volunteers to make a program 
such as this a success. We will welcome anyone with an interest in southwest 
archaeology, and specifically Chimney Rock, to join us,&quot; said Dave 
Jackman, president of the association's governing board.</p>

<p><b>Six of 37 planned lynx releases made</b></p> 
<p>The Colorado Division of Wildlife released six lynx last weekend in 
southwest Colorado as part of the agency's long-term effort to restore the 
native cat to the state.</p> 
<p>According to Todd Malmsbury, chief spokesman for the Division, three males 
and three females were released at a remote location northwest of Creede.</p> 
<p>&quot;All of the animals were in excellent condition,&quot; said Malmsbury. 
&quot;The release went off without a hitch.&quot;</p> 
<p>The Division's reintroduction program began in 1999 with the release of 41 
lynx, followed by 55 more in 2000 and 33 in 2003. Up to 50 more lynx will be 
released in 2005, and another 15 may be released in 2006 and 2007.</p> 
<p>Colorado, said Malmsbury, &quot;is literally writing the textbook with 
respect to lynx in the lower 48; something like this has never been done 
before.&quot;</p> 
<p>Optimism for lynx recovery in the state has been increasing each year as 
the Division continues to learn more about the cats, said Malmsbury, but the 
effort still faces great challenges.</p> 
<p>&quot;We really want to emphasize that while it appears to be going well, 
we still have a long way to go before we can call it a success,&quot; said 
Malmsbury, citing mortality rates that have greatly improved since seven lynx 
succumbed to starvation in the first year of reintroduction.</p> 
<p>&quot;In 1999 we were advised to perform what are called 'hard releases,' 
or releasing the animals as soon as they arrived here in the state,&quot; said 
Malmsbury.</p> 
<p>&quot;But we've since learned to hold them longer and release them when we 
are certain they are in top condition,&quot; he added. As a result, &quot;We've 
had only two deaths related to starvation since that first year, and none 
recently.&quot;</p> 
<p>According to Malmsbury, while starvation is a factor among even established 
populations, the leading causes of lynx mortality in Colorado are human-related.
</p> 
<p>Of the 129 lynx released between 1999-2003, 51 have died, said Malmsbury, 
with 11 mortalities confirmed or &quot;strongly suspected&quot; as the result 
of shooting.</p> 
<p>In addition, at least eight lynx have died after being hit by vehicles, 
said Malmsbury.</p> 
<p>However, Malmsbury indicated only four of the 33 cats released last year 
have died, and stated work on measures that will potentially reduce mortality 
rates further is continuing.</p> 
<p>For example, the Division is developing a vaccine that will protect the 
lynx from plague, an affliction that has claimed at least four cats since the 
reintroduction began.</p> 
<p>&quot;The ultimate goal is to have the number of births exceed the number 
of deaths, but we're certainly not at that point yet,&quot; concluded Malmsbury.
</p> 
<p>This year's release efforts are expected to help bolster the chances for 
such a ratio - a total of 37 lynx will be released into the high-alpine forests 
of the San Juan Mountains before the end of April.</p> 
<p>&quot;These lynx will go into the core reintroduction area where previous 
releases have occurred,&quot; said Rick Kahn, coordinator of the agency's lynx 
reintroduction program. &quot;The lynx released this year will find habitat 
that's already occupied by animals we released in previous years, increasing 
the likelihood that they'll adapt and establish territories.</p> 
<p>&quot;Our goal is to have a high enough population density to allow a 
self-sustaining population of lynx to become established in Colorado,&quot; 
Kahn explained. &quot;If the density is too low, it makes it much less likely 
there will be sufficient reproduction to allow the population to become 
established.&quot;</p> 
<p>Division tracking crews confirmed the birth of at least 16 kittens to six 
lynx mothers last spring, the first time reproduction has been documented. The 
births marked an important milestone for the reintroduction effort. Wildlife 
managers had previously confirmed other important milestones including lynx 
establishing territories and finding ample prey.</p> 
<p>This winter, tracking crews led by researcher Tanya Shenk confirmed that at 
least six of the kittens have made it through the winter and are already 
hunting on their own.</p> 
<p>Crews have also seen tracks and other evidence suggesting that female lynx 
that can no longer be tracked because their radio collars have failed may have 
had kittens as well.</p> 
<p>&quot;We have confirmed that four of the six females that had kittens last 
spring were still with the kittens later this winter,&quot; Shenk said.</p> 
<p>&quot;We are already seeing breeding behavior with at least 11 pairs of 
males and females, and we could see kittens this year from mid-May through 
mid-June,&quot; she said. &quot;Some of these are the same pairs that produced 
kittens last year.&quot;</p> 
<p>The lynx to be released this month were captured earlier this year in 
Quebec and British Columbia, said Scott Wait, the Division's area biologist in 
Durango who coordinated with Canadian officials.</p> 
<p>&quot;We had hoped to have as many as 50 lynx to release, but extreme cold 
in Manitoba didn't allow them to capture any lynx this year,&quot; Wait said.
</p> 
<p>Prior to their release, the lynx are housed at a private facility near the 
San Luis Valley where they are fed and examined to be sure they are in peak 
condition when they are released into the wild.</p> 
<p>Releases occur in April to provide enough time to ensure the lynx are in 
top condition and to coincide with the spring emergence of prey species that 
increase the chances for lynx to survive.</p> 
<p>Lynx once inhabited much of Colorado's high country, but human activity and 
habitat changes lead to the extirpation of the species around the state in the 
late 19th and early 20th centuries.</p> 
<p>The last confirmed lynx was illegally trapped near Vail in 1972. </p>

<p><b>Spring turkey hunt opens April 10</b></p> 
<p>Turkey hunting is more popular than ever in Colorado largely due to ongoing 
efforts by the Colorado Division of Wildlife to introduce more birds to the 
state and effectively manage native populations.</p> 
<p>After years of careful species management, Colorado is now home to thriving 
populations of Rio Grande and Merriam's wild turkeys. Both subspecies will 
offer sportsmen and women ample hunting opportunities when this year's spring 
turkey hunting season begins April 10.</p> 
<p>&quot;Whether they are hunters, or people who just enjoy watching wildlife, 
folks are very passionate about the turkey,&quot; said Rick Hoffman, avian 
researcher for the DOW. &quot;Maybe it is because of their secretive nature or 
their size - they are basically the largest land bird in North America - there 
is a kind of mystique to turkeys.</p> 
<p>&quot;People really seem to enjoy them. From a hunting perspective, the 
turkey is really the small game version of an elk. Hunters enjoy the challenge 
of calling them. The spring season offers opportunity to hunt where there 
aren't a lot of other competing seasons, plus the spring is a great time to be 
outdoors,&quot; Hoffman said.</p> 
<p>DOW statistics illustrate how much wild turkey hunting has risen in 
popularity over the past three decades. There were only 1,301 turkey hunters in 
the Colorado in 1973. By 2002, however, the number of people buying Colorado 
turkey hunting licenses had risen to 12,367. Most of Colorado's turkey hunters 
are residents, with a mere 4 percent of them traveling from other states. DOW 
biologists attribute the trend to higher turkey populations and more suitable 
turkey habitat in neighboring states.</p> 
<p>Colorado's total wild turkey population stands at an estimated 25,000, 
outnumbering hunters by a ratio of 2-to-1 and providing plenty of opportunities 
for both sportsmen and wildlife watchers to hunt for them or observe them in 
their habitats. Two subspecies of wild turkeys call Colorado home, including 
the Merriam's, which typically resides in higher altitudes along the Front 
Range and Western Slope, and Rio Grandes, which live in habitats bordering 
riparian areas on the Eastern Plains.</p> 
<p>Turkeys were nearly eradicated from much of their occupied range in the 
United States as pioneer settlement progressed westward. Due to nationwide 
management efforts, turkey numbers have rebounded across the country, making 
the wild turkey one of the most successful species conservation stories in U.S. 
history.</p> 
<p>Wild turkey management efforts continue today. The DOW, with the help of 
the National Wild Turkey Federation, has conducted three transplant operations 
this year alone. Merriam's turkeys have been transplanted to the Colorado River 
near Grand Junction, and to the Hayman burn site near Divide. Rio Grande 
turkeys have been transplanted to Bijou Creek in Adams County.</p> 
<p>&quot;Normally, when we put these birds out, they reproduce their first 
year,&quot; said Ed Gorman, small game manager for the DOW. &quot;A lot of that 
depends on the quality of habitat that we put them into as well as weather 
patterns. What you see with released turkey populations is when the habitat is 
right and the weather is appropriate, turkeys do really well. They should 
expand quickly if the habitat is correct.&quot;</p> 
<p>Typically, transplanted birds are both trapped from and released into areas 
temporarily closed to hunting. Therefore, neither hunters nor the transplanted 
birds are interfered with and the hope is that additional hunting opportunities 
in these areas will be available in the future once there is a solid population 
of birds.</p> 
<p>Colorado offers hunters two wild turkey seasons, including one in the 
spring and another in the fall. However, 70 percent of the state's turkey 
harvest occurs in the spring. Hunters have an advantage during the spring 
because male turkeys, or toms, are vulnerable to decoys and calling while they 
search for mates during the spring.</p> 
<p>Hoffman said several counties in southwest Colorado provide hunters who buy 
over-the-counter licenses with good hunting odds. They include: Archuleta, 
Montrose, La Plata and Montezuma.</p> 
<p>&quot;Simply put, these areas tend to be the best because there are more 
turkeys on public land,&quot; Hoffman said.</p> 
<p>While Las Animas County produced the highest number of turkeys harvested in 
2003, hunters should keep in mind that most of the land in the county is 
private and gaining access can be difficult.</p> 
<p>Colorado has both limited and over-the-counter turkey tags for certain 
portions of the state. The average harvest success rate for the entire state is 
23 percent, while the success rates for the more coveted limited license areas, 
with higher density turkey populations, averages 53 percent, state biologists 
said.</p> 
<p>The spring turkey season for over-the-counter licenses is April 10-May 23. 
Closing dates vary for limited licenses. Resident turkey licenses cost $10.25. 
Nonresident over-the-counter turkey licenses cost $75.25.</p> 
<p>During the spring season, hunters who draw a limited license are also 
allowed to buy an unlimited over-the-counter license. Hunters with two spring 
licenses can take two bearded turkeys if one of the turkeys is harvested in a 
limited license area and the other is harvested in an unlimited license area. 
Hunters are also allowed to harvest one turkey of either sex during the fall 
season as long as they did not harvest two birds in the spring.</p> 
<p>Those who are heading out into the field this spring to hunt turkeys will 
find the Spring Turkey Outlook for 2004 a useful tool. DOW biologists give a 
region-by-region break down that will educate hunters about what to expect 
throughout the state. The document can be found by visiting

<p><b>Big game hunts getting safer in Colorado</b></p> 
<p>Colorado had one of the safest hunting seasons on record in 2003, according 
to state wildlife officials.</p> 
<p>Unfortunately, seven accidents did occur, including two deaths, 
underscoring the importance of taking the basic, essential steps necessary for 
a safe hunt.</p> 
<p>Last year, the Colorado Division of Wildlife (DOW) sold more than 560,000 
hunting licenses, resulting in millions of hunter recreation days across the 
state. Wildlife officers said fewer and fewer hunting incidents occur each 
year, which is a strong indication that the state's hunter education program is 
working.</p> 
<p>&quot;While we hate to see any incidents at all, when you compare the 
number of hunters and the amount of time they spend in the field with the seven 
incidents, it tells us that we are getting through to hunters with our safety 
message,&quot; said Mark Cousins, acting hunter education coordinator for the 
DOW. &quot;Because of the quality of our program, we are confident that the 
trend of fewer incidents will continue into the future.&quot;</p> 
<p>Cousins noted that three of the five non-fatal incidents involved people 
who had not received hunter education.</p> 
<p>In 1970, the Colorado Legislature mandated hunter education classes for all 
hunters born on or after Jan. 1, 1949. Since then, the number of hunting 
accidents has decreased steadily. In the 1960s, before mandatory hunter 
education, Colorado averaged 10.1 fatal hunting accidents and 24.2 non-fatal 
accidents every year. However, those figures had dropped to 1.3 fatal accidents 
and 11.1 non-fatal accidents by the 1990s.</p> 
<p>Six of last year's incidents occurred while the parties were hunting for 
big game; the other involved small game hunters. One of the deaths and four of 
the injuries were self-inflicted, and the other two involved individuals in the 
same vehicle or hunting party. Some of the incidents were the result of illegal 
behavior, including possession of a loaded firearm in a vehicle or hunting in a 
careless manner.</p> 
<p>Both fatalities occurred during big game hunts. In one instance, an archery 
hunter fell on one of his broadhead arrows, which cut his femoral artery and 
caused him to bleed to death. In the other, a hunter shot a member of his own 
hunting party with a muzzleloader, apparently mistaking him for an elk. 
Authorities said the incident was the result of the hunter failing to identify 
his target.</p> 
<p>A third fatality was recorded last year, too, though it did not involve 
firearms or archery equipment and was not classified as a hunting mishap. A 
waterfowl hunter died after he fell through the ice and drowned while 
attempting to rescue his dog.</p> 
<p>&quot;When hunters head into the field, they need to remember that a moment 
of carelessness can result in a lifetime of consequences,&quot; Cousins said.

<p><b>Wide-ranging conditions in Colorado's life zones</b></p> 
<p><b>By Chuck McGuire</b></p> 
<p><b>SUN Columnist</b></p> 
<p>As an eternal optimist, I believe life is always good, but as an emphatic 
outdoorsman, I believe life in Colorado's high country is truly grand.</p> 
<p>Sure, there's winter, with snow and sub-zero temperatures, to contend with. 
The inevitable spring thaw and mud season seem to last forever, and even long 
summer days under a blistering hot sun wear me down after awhile. But as far as 
I'm concerned, seasonal change is part of the real beauty of mountain living. 
Then again, it certainly helps to have one of the most diverse landscapes in 
the entire United States.</p> 
<p>Colorado is just far enough north, and with a low point of 3,300 feet above 
sea level, that one can never quite escape winter entirely. But if winter is 
unavoidable, at least lower-elevation temperatures are relatively moderate, and 
ample sunshine allows for many comfortable afternoons hiking or horseback 
riding in canyon country. For those of us who enjoy cold and snow, there are 
high alpine ski areas with beautiful forests and lots of light fluffy powder.
</p> 
<p>Needless to say, winters aren't like that everywhere.</p> 
<p>I vividly recall, as a child growing up in the Midwest, my joy and 
astonishment watching the annual Tournament of Roses Parade on television. 
Naturally, it was New Year's Day, and as participants and spectators basked in 
the warm California sun, most wore only short-sleeved shirts. Lawns were green 
and neatly groomed, Coconut palms swayed lazily in the temperate breeze, and 
fruit trees appeared heavy with ripening citrus.</p> 
<p>Meanwhile, the air temperature outside my window was seldom more than 10 or 
15 degrees, and even if the sun was shining, the ever-present windchill quickly 
nullified any warming affects it might offer.</p> 
<p>I can't say how old I was back then, but I remember thinking it odd that 
two totally different climates could exist in the same country at the same time.
</p> 
<p>As a young adult, I moved to a Colorado ski resort, and soon discovered 
wide-ranging conditions existing in a variety of life zones, depending 
primarily on elevation.</p> 
<p>For instance, it's April now, and here at 7,000 feet, spring has gained a 
fairly solid foothold. The sun is out, and through moderating temperatures, the 
once heavy valley snow pack has quickly vanished. Grassy meadows are now that 
illustrious green, unveiling renewed life after a season of dormancy. The 
aspens and Narrowleaf Cottonwoods bear new buds that will soon unfurl into a 
thick canopy of green, providing shade for a lush understory of sprouting 
grasses and shrubs. Robins and Mountain Bluebirds are back after a long winter 
hiatus. Meanwhile, Gunnison's prairie dogs have emerged from their burrows, and 
await the arrival of a new generation of offspring.</p> 
<p>No doubt it's still possible, if not probable, that more wintry weather 
will befall us before I'm completely comfortable digging out the camping gear. 
Then again, should the impulse become too great, I can head for lower 
elevations. By now, regular daytime highs in the western canyons are reaching 
into the 70s and low 80s.</p> 
<p>The canyons and mesas of western Colorado are part of the vast Colorado 
Plateau, a high-elevation tableland of sedimentary rock formations and 
sagebrush flats. Other than narrow bands of willows and a few cottonwoods along 
the Colorado River and its many tributaries, no trees grow in the arid 
landscape, which averages less than 10 inches of precipitation a year.</p> 
<p>Towering escarpments, boulder fields, sagebrush and prickly pear cactus 
provide cover for a variety of snakes, small lizards, Jackrabbits and Sage 
grouse. Golden eagles and the occasional Ferruginous hawk will ride the mid-day 
thermals, watching for the slightest movement below. Meanwhile, nocturnal 
predators like the Great Horned owl and bobcat find an assortment of small 
rodents easy prey.</p> 
<p>With sub-zero temperatures on the coldest winter nights, and daytime highs 
hovering around 100 in July, the canyon country is a land of extremes. Between 
winter, with its short days and chilly nights, and the long hot summer, camping 
season is relatively brief. More often than not, I'll limit my visits to day 
trips for a few hours of hiking, or jeeping the back roads.</p> 
<p>Between 5,000 and 7,000 feet in elevation, the sagebrush flats are lost, 
and the pi&ntilde;on-juniper woodlands appear. This transition zone, called the 
upper Sonoran, is really the beginning of the &quot;high country.&quot; While 
the region is still very dry, slow-growing Pi&ntilde;on pines and Juniper 
cedars will eventually attain a height of about 30 feet. To conserve moisture, 
they're typically widely-spaced, often allowing the dense Juniper to live 2,000 
years or more.</p> 
<p>A wide array of birds, squirrels and other mammals live in the upper 
Sonoran zone, with the highly nutritional pi&ntilde;on nut making up an 
important part of their diets. I've never actually harvested one, but according 
to those who know, it's larger and heavier than most other pine nuts, while 
supposedly containing as many calories as chocolate, and as much protein as 
beef.</p> 
<p>Drought is always a concern in the semi-arid West, and over the past few 
years, it has taken its toll on vast stands of coniferous forests throughout 
the high country. In the upper Sonoran zone, as well as the higher Montane and 
Subalpine zones, various beetle infestations have decimated thousands of acres 
of Pi&ntilde;on, Ponderosa pine, Lodgepole pine, and Engelmann spruce. In some 
regions of southwest and north-central Colorado, Pi&ntilde;on and Lodgepole 
forests stand brown and lifeless, adding significantly to the threat of fires.
</p> 
<p>Beetles are always present, but adequate moisture usually allows trees to 
produce sufficient sap to fend them off. In the Montane zone, between 6,000 and 
9,500 feet, 15 to 25 inches of annual precipitation generally fall as snow. 
Here, Ponderosa pines cover the dryer south-facing slopes, with Douglas firs 
dominating the shaded north-facing slopes. In disturbed areas, where avalanches 
or fires have raged, faster-growing Lodgepole pine or groves of aspen fill in.
</p> 
<p>Higher still, the Subalpine fir and Engelmann spruce dominate the cool 
Subalpine zone between 9,000 feet and timberline at 11,500 feet. With frequent 
high winds and cold, moist conditions, the growing season is only about two 
months long. Nevertheless, the slow-growing spruce and fir tolerate the harsh 
climate well, where at higher elevations, a spruce with a trunk a few inches in 
diameter might be several hundred years old.</p> 
<p>The Montane and Subalpine zones make up much of the Rocky Mountain timber 
belt. With moderate summertime temperatures and sufficient moisture in the form 
of heavy winter snows, conditions are well-suited to sustaining immense forests 
and a wide variety of wildlife. Everything from small reptiles and amphibians 
to bears, mountain lions and moose inhabit the region.</p> 
<p>The Alpine Tundra is the highest of Colorado's life zones, easily 
recognized by its lack of trees. With its thin atmosphere and harsh cold, 
winter is the dominant season at elevations reaching as high as 14,433 feet 
(Mount Elbert), and summer may sometimes last only a few weeks. Strong winds 
are the primary factor in the vegetation makeup of the tundra, where any trees 
or shrubs not insulated by a blanket of snow are freeze-dried by gusts that can 
exceed 200 miles an hour.</p> 
<p>During winter, wildlife is scarce above tree line. Ptarmigan and pikas 
remain active, but except for the wind, the land is almost silent. In contrast, 
the tundra comes alive during its short summer. The greatest diversity of 
Colorado's 300 species of wildflowers are found here, and bighorn sheep, 
mountain goats, elk, other mammals and many birds move onto the tundra to 
forage and escape pesky insects found at lower elevations.</p> 
<p>I've gained a few years since my childhood fascination with seasonal 
diversity, but today, I still marvel at the broad range of climates, flora, and 
fauna found in the Colorado high country. With such multiplicity always 
available to an emphatic outdoorsman, life is truly grand.</p> <b>&nbsp;Letters

<p><b>Nest box time</b></p> 
<p>Dear Editor:</p> 
<p>The bluebirds have arrived and it is time to check out those nest boxes 
that are already hanging for mice, etc. Any old nests should be cleaned out. 
Also it is time to put new boxes in place.</p> 
<p>The Western and Mountain Bluebirds require a nest box hole of at least 1 
9/16 inches. It is best to place boxes approximately 300 feet apart as these 
birds are territorial. My preference is to have the boxes mounted on a seven 
foot metal or PVC pole that is slippery so as to deter varmints and cats. Other 
birds such as chickadees like to use the boxes as well. Good luck on your 
bluebird sightings!</p>

<p><b>More information</b></p> 
<p>Dear Editor:</p> 
<p>It was with great difficulty that I resisted a response to the ridiculous 
remarks found in the SUN's letters, titled &quot;Saddam Sharon?&quot; I am 
pleased now I did not, as Mr. Boutwell and Mr. Gross did a fine job on behalf 
of all thinking individuals who don't just automatically fall for the bigoted 
anti-Israel propaganda from the left. I would like to add some other 
information as reported by the Haaretz News Service out of Israel.</p> 
<p>Since Arafat declared intifada, &quot;war&quot; against Israel, after he 
refused to accept 97 percent of his own demands, there have been 29 
Palestinians under the age of 18 who have carried out &quot;suicide 
attacks&quot; and 22 others under 18 who have carried out &quot;sacrificial 
attacks&quot; in which the attacker opens fire and then is killed by I.D.F. 
soldiers. Forty others under 18, have been arrested under suspicion of 
intending to carrying out attacks.</p> 
<p>Last week soldiers found an explosive charge on a cart being pushed by a 
pre-teen Palestinian boy, and by now every one is aware of another boy who was 
stopped before he was able to detonate his explosive vest. As reported by 
Haaretz, the 14-year-old boy, Hussan Abdu, said he was &quot;tempted by the 
promise of having sexual relations&quot; with 72 virgins. He was said to have 
been bullied by fellow Palestinian students for having bad grades in school and 
wanted to &quot;prove himself a hero.&quot; A 17-year-old girl who was caught 
committing fornication was offered, &quot;martyrdom&quot; or stoning. She chose 
to die for Allah.</p> 
<p>I once had the privilege to stay in a Roman Catholic home in Belfast, 
Northern Ireland. The first night after arriving, a terrorist bomb was 
detonated nearby. I asked my host when the violence in Northern Ireland would 
end. His response was simple: &quot;When the radicals leave the young people 
alone.&quot;</p> 
<p>Another time, while staying with friends in London, another bomb went off 
less than a mile away. For over 50 years the I.R.A. and other splinter groups 
continue the violence and the indoctrination of youth on both sides, continues.
</p> 
<p>Former Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir said the violence in the Middle 
East would end when the &quot;Arab's love for their children was greater than 
their hatred for the Jews.&quot; There are no greater cowards than so-called 
&quot;victims&quot; who sacrifice children rather than take up the fight 
themselves.</p> 
<p>The left, including John Kerry, if allowed to change the balance of power, 
will embrace the brutal dictators of the Arab world in order to appease their 
threats of continued terror, and will desert the Israelis who at least enlist 
adult males as opposed to children to fight their battles.</p> 
<p>Something to think about, come November.</p>

<p><b>Wrong man</b></p> 
<p>Dear Editor:</p> 
<p>In the March 30 Denver Post, Bill Husted reported on a penthouse gourmet 
dinner and strategy meeting that took place with Ken Salazar and 20 backers.</p>
<p>A March 31 headline referred to how much money these fat cats have put up 
in order to win the election. All this money and attention for a candidate who 
has yet to state what he believes or what he hopes to accomplish in office.</p> 
<p>When President Bush's father was campaigning for his own reelection we 
heard complaints that he could not explain why he wanted to be president. Could 
the same be said of Ken Salazar and his bid for the Senate seat? Does Salazar 
know why he is running or has he been enticed to sing someone else's song in 
exchange for a lucrative U.S. Senate seat? Why is he asking us to support him 
on the basis of his name alone? Where does he stand on issues of health care, 
foreign policy, alternative energy, job creation and education?</p> 
<p>Several of my friends say they support Salazar because he can win. No one 
can question his record as attorney general. It is superb. Salazar knows 
Colorado like the back of his hand. But what value is this expertise in 
Washington? We need to send someone to the Senate who understands foreign 
policy, has military and counter-terrorism experience, knows how to improve 
education and will stand up to special interests to ensure the health of our 
citizens and the environment.</p> 
<p>Better to give this kind of candidate, a candidate like Mike Miles, the 
nomination than to elect one based solely on name recognition. This is shallow. 
It lacks principle. Like the rah-rah Little League parent whose interest is not 
in the game but whether or not his kid wins - and winning is everything.</p>

<p><b>Road negligence</b></p> 
<p>Dear Editor:</p> 
<p>Due to negligence on the Village Drive project, I am appalled by the lack 
of upkeep and the way this road has been put off due to weather.</p> 
<p>Why was it torn up in October, knowing that bad weather was on the way? 
Mark Garcia, the town administrator, told us at Fairfield Activities they would 
start paving as soon as we had four consecutive days of weather over 50 degrees.
</p> 
<p>We had that weather for over a month, but they're just now getting to it, 
and they are doing things that could have been done when it was still chilly 
out. Things like digging trenches for water run off; and the bike path that was 
put in by the town last year is now in danger of being destroyed by this 
construction.</p> 
<p>After asking the construction workers how long this project would take, I 
was told &quot;by the end of the summer.&quot; How is it that Highway 84 can be 
paved from the New Mexico state line to U.S. 160 in a couple of months, yet it 
is going to take five months to do less than a quarter mile here? Taxpayers 
should be outraged.</p> 
<p>A day after my first letter to the editor all that was done was a Slow sign 
was put up and then a few days later the road was graded. Damages to peoples' 
vehicles have been overlooked and no compassion has been shown.</p> 
<p>James E. (Rick) Harvey</p> 
<p>Editor's note: Since workers hired by a contractor are not always the best 
source of information concerning contract specifics and project schedules, it 
is best to refer to this week's article about the town council and the update 
on the paving.</p> 
<p><b>Ambulance taxi</b></p> 
<p>Dear Editor:</p> 
<p>An ambulance with two uniformed district employees arrived at the South 
Pagosa Park on 8th Street Saturday morning. A medical emergency or trauma 
injury? No. Taxi service.</p> 
<p>A passenger stepped out of the back of the ambulance. To the astonishment 
of onlookers, he came to remove a campaign sign. A campaign sign listing 
&quot;independent&quot; candidates.</p> 
<p>The ambulance was stopped (by Pat Curtis) and the driver was asked the name 
of the man he had delivered. This question apparently caused distress as the 
driver hesitated to answer, looked to the other crew member, then identified 
the passenger delivered by the ambulance as Neil Dennis.</p> 
<p>Was he sent by district officials by ambulance to move the sign of the 
&quot;independent&quot; candidates? No, no, can't be any connection.</p> 
<p>He probably just hitched a ride with an ambulance on the way to the Health 
Fair - except the ambulance turned around and went in the opposite direction.
</p> 
<p>Is this a legitimate use of tax-supported resources? Money? Manpower?</p> 
<p>Just how &quot;independent&quot; are these candidates?</p> 
<p>Who is at the wheel of their campaign?</p> 
<p>Are your tax dollars being spent on a campaign?</p> 
<p>Leading up to this event: the South Pagosa Park was reserved for a 
neighborhood cookout during the Health Fair by the ProHealth Coalition, which 
is running six candidates for the upcoming USJHSD board election. When I and 
other volunteers arrived that morning to prepare for the event, there stood the 
13-foot sign on a trailer promoting the &quot;Independents.&quot; Apparently, 
supporters had parked the truck on the town park property earlier and left.</p> 
<p>Since the ProHealth group had reserved the park in advance, dispatch was 
called to inquire if that group had also reserved space in the park.</p> 
<p>Why was the sign a problem, you ask? Town officials determined that no 
money was paid and no permission sought or given for the sign to be there. The 
officials decided there was no provision in the sign code to issue a permit for 
campaign signs on public property so they asked that the sign be removed.</p> 
<p>A short time later, the ambulance arrived.</p>

<p><b>Bad swap</b></p> 
<p>Dear Editor:</p> 
<p>Do we want a duplication of the fiasco at the Wolf Creek Ski Area? </p> 
<p>I would like to point out to the citizens of Pagosa Springs that you now 
have to opportunity to try to prevent the Forest Service from consummating 
another land exchange that threatens our wildlife, our way of life and our 
choice of leisure time activities.</p> 
<p>Just like the Wolf Creek property exchange, discussion is now in the works 
to exchange Forest Service land in our town with a developer. The approximately 
320-acre Job Corps site, four miles up Piedra Road, is a haven for deer, elk, 
grouse, wild turkey, bear and fox. I have even run into a lynx on one of my 
hikes.</p> 
<p>This site is also a recreation area for Pagosans who like to hunt, ride 
horses, cross country ski and hike. In addition to aesthetic arguments, it is 
outrageous that the Forest Service would even consider such an inequitable 
exchange.</p> 
<p>The area proposed for the exchange, 102 acres known as Kenney Flats and 
Laughlin Park, has a questionable commercial value. The asking price for an 
acre in a subdivision just two miles up Piedra Road from the Job Corps site is 
over $50,000 an acre, making the Job Corps site worth about $16 million 
commercially.</p> 
<p>Make your opinions known. Let the Forest Service know your feelings about 
taking this land away from us. Remember, the Forest Service works for us, the 
taxpayers.</p> 
<p>Bryant W. Lemon Sr.</p> 
<p><b>Block easements</b></p> 
<p>Dear Editor:</p> 
<p>Most of your readers have heard by now that there is a proposed development 
adjacent to Wolf Creek Ski area to be called &quot;The Village at Wolf 
Creek&quot; (you have covered this possibility in recent issues). It is to be 
located at the foot of the Alberta lift on 286 acres of private land inside the 
Forest Service boundary. The developer has requested from the Forest Service 
certain easements for access and utility systems to serve the development.</p> 
<p>Unfortunately, preliminary plat approval of the development by Mineral 
County has been granted. The development is unreasonable in many respects and 
the Forest Service should not grant any easements beyond those already in 
existence. The scheduled EIS will show the extent of negative impacts, 
including physical and socioeconomic, which would result if the requested 
access to the proposed development is granted.</p> 
<p>At this stage, it appears the only way to limit or deny the development is 
for the Forest Service to refuse augmented access and easements for utilities 
through federal property.</p> 
<p>It is evident that the addition of more than 4,000 beds on site would far 
exceed the capacity of the ski area facilities which are already taxed by 
attendance levels near 5,000 on peak days. This alone should be reason enough 
to restrict access to the &quot;Village&quot; site to limit drastically, if not 
prevent the development.</p> 
<p>It is unjust that negative socioeconomic impacts of any development at Wolf 
Creek are almost imperceptible as far as Mineral County is concerned, but the 
county would be the beneficiary of any tax base generated by development.</p> 
<p>Archuleta and Rio Grande counties would bear the costs of government 
services for occupants of a developed site and for the work force and its 
families located in Pagosa Springs and South Fork. Yet, these entities have had 
no say in the approval process.</p> 
<p>It is the public obligation of the Forest Service to prevent these 
inequities and deny the requested easements for access and utility systems. If 
you should choose to print this letter, reader comments should be directed to:

<p><b>You're welcome</b></p> 
<p>Dear Editor:</p> 
<p>I am a graduate of Pagosa Springs High School, Class of 2003. After 
graduation I decided I wanted to join the Marine Corps and am currently with 
the 1st Marine Division, 9th Comm. at Camp Pendleton, Calif.</p> 
<p>The other day I called home and was talking with my parents and we got on 
the subject of the current situation in Iraq. During this conversation, they 
told me a certain individual wrote in condemning what we are doing there.</p> 
<p>They read me her letter and the more they read to me, the madder I got.</p> 
<p>I signed up because I thought I had a debt to pay to all of my fellow 
Marines who have paid the ultimate price for this great nation. Not only have 
Marines died, but also members of the Army, Navy, Air Force and Coast Guard.</p>
<p>Whenever I hear of people such as this lady, I can't help but say, 
&quot;you're welcome.&quot; I will continue to go in harm's way for you. Let's 
not mention the countless tears that are shed by American servicemen and women, 
the loneliness and having to say good-bye to our loved ones.</p> 
<p>I guess she has also forgotten the ages of these American servicemen and 
women - 17, 18, 19 and 20, mostly. Yes, they are the ones who are going into 
harm's way daily so those like her can criticize the American military.</p> 
<p>Did you ever stop to think that if it wasn't for the American military your 
children would have had to live on a daily basis wondering if they would see 
tomorrow?</p> 
<p>If you think we should have left the Iraqi dictator in power, maybe you 
should have lived over there for a few years getting to see little children 
and, yes, babies, being gassed and killed.</p> 
<p>Just be thankful you have young men and women who are willing to die so you 
can stand back and enjoy the freedom you have daily. The next time you 
criticize the American military, stop and think of the blood and tears shed, 
the loneliness and having to see your comrades die, comrades you spend 365 days 
a year with.</p> 
<p>In closing, all I have to say is, &quot;You're Welcome!&quot; And the next 
time the need for our assistance to defend freedom arises, I will answer it 
willingly.</p> 
<p>Enjoy your freedom of speech, freedom to worship who you want, and being 
able to not live in fear.</p> 
<p>May God bless this nation.</p>

<p><b>Stop litter - now</b></p> 
<p>Dear Editor:</p> 
<p>The litter in Pagosa Springs has to end. In the past, letters have been 
written in a cooperative spirit pleading for support, but to no avail.</p> 
<p>So now, this message will be a little more to the point. When asked about 
the overabundance of litter, people say, &quot;Well, it is because the snow is 
melting.&quot; Some say it is the fault of tourists and vacationers.</p> 
<p>These answers can no longer be used as an excuse. The litter was here 
before the snow and has been on the ground for weeks since the snow has been 
gone.</p> 
<p>Humans are the reason for the litter. The same litter will sit in spots for 
weeks until a caring person picks it up. We need to educate those who are 
littering our beautiful Pagosa Springs. We need to advertise the importance of 
keeping our county clean.</p> 
<p>Many towns have signs urging &quot;Please Keep Our Town Clean.&quot; Our 
radio station and newspaper need to start campaigns for the litter to stop. I 
understand there are community service programs and certain days for community 
litter pickup, but it is not enough.</p> 
<p>It is not solely the job of the town employees. Each member of the 
community needs to help stop the litter. Each property owner/manager needs to 
be responsible for their litter. Simply get a bag and clean up your property.
</p> 
<p>Myself and others try to pick up as much litter as possible but we can only 
do so much. People need to stop overfilling their trash cans, trash trucks and 
Dumpsters. The poor animals have to swim right alongside plastic bags, boxes 
and trash of all sorts. I consistently see birds eating plastic.</p> 
<p>As Harvey Schwartz mentioned, the most commonly littered garbages are 
cigarette butts, cans, bottles, bags and wrappers. Packing materials are also a 
major concern. Materials such as the little white Styrofoam pieces and shredded 
paper used for packing are scattered everywhere and makes for time consuming 
cleanup.</p> 
<p>Some areas do not have restrictions on their litter, but it should be 
illegal for the trash to blow onto my property.</p> 
<p>We need to come up with a new plan for litter because the current plan is 
not working. I stress the education part of the plan, not only for the young, 
but for the adults as well.</p> 
<p>Everyone needs to work together. I am asking for the help of the community, 
business owners, real estate firms, radio stations, newspapers, and others who 
feel this is an important issue.</p>

<p>&quot;Do you remember Rocky Mountain Conference? The other day I was 
remembering the old Rocky Mountain Conference. If you lived in Colorado years 
ago you probably do too.</p> 
<p>&quot;I recall most of the teams that played in it. There was Colorado 
University (CU) and Denver University (DU). Those two teams had a big game on 
Thanksgiving. It was a great game and was played in the new DU stadium, which 
was a fantastic thing to most people in those days. Another team was the 
Colorado School of Mines which was often the champion of the league. There was 
Colorado Teachers College in Greeley, Western State in Gunnison, Colorado State 
in Fort Collins and Colorado College in Colorado Springs. I believe Wyoming and 
Montana were members and there was Utah which was a perennial champion.</p> 
<p>&quot;I remember very well how we often talked about the day when a 
Colorado team would beat Utah! Regis College in Denver was a perennial power 
but they belonged to the Catholic Conference. While they did not play in the 
same conference, they often played practice games against the Rocky Mountain 
Conference teams. That Rocky Mountain Conference was replaced by the Big 8 and 
then by the Big 12 of today. Do you remember?&quot;</p> 
<p>We are pleased by the number of people who enjoy George's contribution to

<p><b>Prevention tips</b></p> 
<p>Do not give important numbers (credit card, bank account, calling card or 
Social Security) over the phone, unless you have done business with your 
contact in the past and know of their reputation.</p> 
<p>Check out a company before you do business over the phone. Wait for the

<p>If you do make a purchase over the phone, get the company's telephone 
number, address and name of sales agent.</p> 
<p>If you've never done business with a company that contacts you, request 
written information from them.</p>

spaces available and all have been claimed but one. The price for participation 
in this display is $50 per month, and the Chamber pays all the quarterly 
invoices and invoices the other investors. If you are interested in this 
opportunity, give us a call at 264-2360.</p> 
<p><b>Cinco de Mayo</b></p> 
<p>The Pagosa Springs Spanish Fiesta Club will host a Cinco de Mayo 
celebration 5-7 p.m. Saturday, May 8 at the Vista Center. This is a family 
affair with games and prizes provided by nonprofits and hot dogs and 
refreshments served by the Spanish Fiesta Club.</p> 
<p>The entertainment for the evening will be provided by Grupo Espinosa, a 
local family of talented young Folklorico Dancers. Under the instruction of 
Hispanic Cultural Educator, Gloria Lopez, this troupe has danced to the delight 
of many audiences.</p> 
<p>The 2004 Fiesta Grand Marshall will be announced and the coronation of 
Spanish Fiesta Royalty will take place at 6 p.m. Applications are available at 
the Chamber of Commerce or you can call Natalie Ortega at 264-4604. Nominations 
for Grand Marshall are welcome at P.O. Box 71 in Pagosa, 81147.</p> 
<p>At 7 p.m. the clubhouse will be cleared out and doors will reopen at 7:30 
for the dance featuring local Spanish band, Variety Express. Cost for the dance 
is $10 and it will begin at 8. The Guadalupana Society will offer delicious 
posole and tortillas, and the Fiesta Club will serve other refreshments. You 
can purchase a slice of Cinco de Mayo cake from the Grupo Espinosa dancers with 
proceeds benefiting each organization. Door prizes have been donated by several 
Pagosa individuals and businesses, and the best dancers of the evening will be 
rewarded with prizes.</p> 
<p>If you would like to volunteer for this event or are interested in being a 
part of the Spanish Fiesta taking place June 19, call Jeff Laydon, 264-3686, or 
Lucy Gonzales at 264-4791. You are also invited to attend the next Spanish 
Fiesta Club meeting, 5:30 p.m. Tuesday, April 13 in the Chamber of Commerce 
boardroom. Viva la Fiesta.</p> 
<p><b>Ross tournament</b></p> 
<p>I talked with Cody Ross just this morning and he said everything is moving 
along right on target with their ninth annual Dirk and Colt Ross Memorial 
Basketball Tournament to be held on April 15-18 here in Pagosa. The proceeds 
from this terrific event will go to a scholarship fund to benefit local youths 
of Pagosa and Ignacio. College competition is expected along with quality 
referees and a special memorial presentation. I am truly delighted to hear that 
all is going well with an event that has become yet another Pagosa tradition 
and certainly encourage everyone out there to support it.</p> 
<p>There will be the three divisions: Open, 6 Feet and Under and 35 and Over 
with a $200 fee per team. Prizes will be awarded to first, second, third and 
fourth place teams, an All-Tournament Team, Tournament MVP, Mr. Defense, Mr. 
Hustle, Slam-Dunk Contest, 3-Point Shootout and many door prizes. For more 
information, please call Troy Ross at 264-5265.</p> 
<p><b>Still time</b></p> 
<p>You still have time to submit your favorite family classics and maybe 
not-so-classic recipes for an upcoming cookbook which will boast the &quot;best 
of Pagosa Springs&quot; in appetizers, beverages, soups and salads, vegetables 
and side dishes, main dishes, breads and rolls, desserts, cookies and candy, 
&quot;this and that&quot; and pet treats.</p> 
<p>The Humane Society of Pagosa Springs is about the business of collecting 
recipes from local cooks to be published in a cookbook that should be available 
for purchase around the middle of July. As always, you can count on some 
absolutely scrumptious dishes (after all, who in their right mind would submit 
a bad recipe to this kind of project?) and a potentially great gift item for 
friends and family.</p> 
<p>If you have recipes that have been passed down through your family for many 
generations or just some irresistible, taste-tempting treat you would like to 
share with others, please pick up a recipe submittal form at the Humane Society 
Thrift Store, Moonlight Books or the Chamber of Commerce. </p> 
<p>Because the book will include only about 250 recipes, there is no guarantee 
that all submitted recipes will be used. Please submit no more than two recipes 
and include your name, address and phone number in case the HS folks have 
questions. You may submit your recipe(s) electronically if you wish at 
hspscook@earthlink.net.</p> 
<p>The deadline for submission is April 15 and you may return them in person 
to the Thrift Store or mail them to P.O. Box 146, Chromo, CO 81128. If you have 
questions, call Lynn Constan at 264-5451.</p> 
<p><b>5-Ring Circus</b></p> 
<p>Last Friday afternoon a local woman came in to purchase tickets for herself 
and her children and could barely contain her excitement at the prospect of 
attending a real-live circus. On Thursday, April 15, we will all have the 
opportunity to attend the Carson &amp; Barnes 5-Ring Circus right here in 
Pagosa Springs for either a 4:30 or 7:30 p.m. show with acrobats, clowns, 
trapeze artists and performing elephants, lions, camels, dogs and horses.</p> 
<p>Performers from around the world will be there as well as 
&quot;Jennie&quot; the star baby elephant. If you would like, you are invited 
to come early in the day between 8-10 a.m. to watch the elephants raise the Big 
Top and see the circus come alive. I think this is a fabulous chance for all of 
us to become kids again and enjoy the wonders of a circus.</p> 
<p>Advance tickets (must be purchased before April 15) for this event are 
available on the west side of Pagosa at the Shell Station, Bank of Colorado, 
Shang Hai Restaurant, The Corner Store (FINA Station) and Wells Fargo Bank. In 
town you can purchase tickets at Citizens Bank, Vectra Bank, Chamber of 
Commerce, Bank of the San Juans and the Pagosa Springs Community Center.</p> 
<p>Advance tickets are $10 for adults and $5 for kids. Box office prices will 
be $14 and $7, so obviously you will save a considerable amount of dough by 
buying your tickets in advance. The circus will take place on Hot Springs 
Boulevard in the field between the Bank of the San Juans and the community 
center.</p> 
<p><b>Music in the Mountains</b></p> 
<p>For those of you who were so upset last year when you couldn't purchase 
tickets for sold-out Music in the Mountains performances, I offer a word or two 
of caution: We will most assuredly sell out again this year well before the 
concert dates, so I would suggest that you head on down to the Chamber and buy 
them as soon as possible. I say this not only from a historical perspective, 
but from the current reality that we have already sold around two hundred 
tickets for performances that don't even begin until July. Please don't 
procrastinate and become a very disappointed classical music lover.</p> 
<p>On July 23, a real Pagosa favorite, pianist Aviram Reichert will perform 
the works of Schumann with several members of the Dallas and Baltimore 
symphonies. Another crowd-pleaser, Antonio Pompa-Baldi, will appear on July 30 
with a solo performance and a performance with his wife, Emanuela Friscioni, an 
award-winner in her own right. On Aug. 6, we will welcome Anne-Marie McDermott 
on piano and Philippe Quint on violin playing Martinu's Madrigals and Brahms' 
Piano Quintet.</p> 
<p>If you would like to get on the mailing list for these and all future Music 
in the Mountains events, please call 385-6820 and specify that you want to be 
on the Pagosa Springs mailing list.</p> 
<p><b>Open house</b></p> 
<p>We are always especially delighted to announce anniversary celebrations for 
our members because it, of course, speaks to the success of yet another year in 
business. This time we congratulate the good folks at Monograms Plus, Mike and 
Martha McMullin, on not only completing a year with Monograms but on the recent 
expansion and renovation of their facilities. They invited me to tour the 
&quot;new look&quot; and I was most impressed with the additions.</p> 
<p>The McMullins are combining forces with Marla Hubbard who has relocated 
right next door to Monograms with her alterations and custom sewing business, 
Let 'er Rip, to host the open house. Please join Martha, Marla and Mike 11 
a.m.-2 p.m. Saturday, April 17, at 510 San Juan from for free hot dogs, chicken 
legs and drinks. There will be drawings for all kinds of cool &quot;stuff&quot; 
like clothes and alterations, so don't miss it.</p> 
<p><b>Membership</b></p> 
<p>We are happy to introduce two new members this week along with seven 
renewals, certainly one of the more pleasant aspects of our Chamber activities.
</p> 
<p>An existing member, Wade Duncan with Genesis Mortgage, joins us with a 
second business, Rocky Mountain Home and Leisure. Wade offers retail sales of 
Jacuzzi Premium and Nordic Spas, billiards equipment, deck and patio furniture 
and bars and barbecue islands. All of this sounds like a party in the making to 
me with the summer months rapidly approaching, and I'm sure Wade will be able 
to fill you in on all the details about each and every one of these offerings. 
You can give him a call at 264-1717 to learn more about Rocky Mountain Home and 
Leisure.</p> 
<p>Our second new member this week is Cindy Gowing who brings us A Beautiful 
Memory Photography with offices in her home. Cindy reminds us that one of the 
ways we can cherish our memories for many years to come is with photographs. 
Cindy is the one to call for professional photography of families, children, 
pets and special events. She brings with her 18 years experience and will be 
happy to answer any questions you might have about A Beautiful Memory 
Photography at 731-3563.</p> 
<p>Our renewals this week include Arthur (Hank) Anstine Jr. with Wolf Creek 
Outfitters, Inc.; Mike and Martha McMullin with Monograms Plus; Petra Joy with 
Joy Automotive at their excellent new location downtown; Duane Noggle, 
superintendent of Archuleta School District 50 Joint; Mike and Lisa Kraetsch 
with The Liberty Theatre; Linda Gundelach with Coolheads, Inc. and Elsa Lucero 
with Bank of the San Juans. We sincerely thank each and every one of you.</p>

<p><b>Many resources on health issues</b></p> 
<p><b>By Lenore Bright</b></p> 
<p><b>SUN Columnist</b></p> 
<p>Congratulations to Sharee Grazda and the many volunteers who put on this 
year's health fair.</p> 
<p>We thank the generous community organizations and leaders that help with 
financial needs as well as provide warm bodies to keep this fair operating for 
the public good.</p> 
<p>The library had a booth telling about the many information resources we 
have about health issues.</p> 
<p>One item is called the &quot;Nidus Report,&quot; that covers more than 75 
diseases and problems. The report is updated quarterly and has excellent 
background pieces.</p> 
<p>Please ask for help in accessing these reports if you want information on 
any specific health problem. We have many books on general medical subjects as 
well. We can also help with Web site addresses on a variety of health subjects.
</p> 
<p><b>Colorado hospitals</b> </p> 
<p>Just received a CD from the Colorado Health and Hospital Association that 
is the annual reference guide to financial data about all the hospitals in the 
state. If you are contemplating hospitalization, you might want to look at the 
CD. You may look at it on our computer.</p> 
<p><b>New books</b></p> 
<p>&quot;George and Laura: Portrait of an American Marriage,&quot; by 
Christopher Andersen is a compelling look at a unique partnership, and the 
courage, grace and humor that defines it. Not since Franklin Delano Roosevelt 
has a president faced a surprise attack on American soil. And not since Eleanor 
Roosevelt has a first lady been called upon to be a strong ally during such a 
crisis. This book is the story of what shaped the Bushes as individuals and 
prepared them to play the important historical roles forced upon them by 9/11.
</p> 
<p>Andersen paints a vivid, sometimes startling portrait of the couple. 
Andersen is author of 23 books and a former editor of Time and People.</p> 
<p>&quot;Ultimate Weight Solution: The 7 keys to weight loss freedom,&quot; by 
Dr. Phil McGraw, is the latest in a long list of diet books. He has cut through 
the confusion of fad diets with clinically supported information and action 
plans for lasting weight management. There is even a chapter on &quot;weight 
loss resistant people.&quot; Dr. Phil hands you the keys so you can finally be 
in control of your weight. You get to make the right decisions.</p> 
<p>Dr. Phil is one of the world's foremost experts in the field of human 
functioning.</p> 
<p>&quot;Creative Play Activities for Children With Disabilities: a Resource 
Book for Teachers and Parents,&quot; by Lisa Rappaport Morris and Linda Schulz, 
covers 250 games and activities designed to help infants to 8-year-olds with 
all types of disabilities grow through play.</p> 
<p>Each chapter focuses on a particular activity theme including exploring the 
world of the senses. Each activity has complete direction and a list of the 
equipment needed.</p> 
<p>These are wonderful activities for all children caregivers. They were 
developed in conjunction with the Joseph P. Kennedy Jr. Foundation. The book 
has an excellent resources index of associations and agencies dedicated to 
helping children with disabilities.</p>

<p> </p> <b>Veteran's Corner</b> 
<p><b>Many veterans utilized 9Health Fair opportunity</b></p> 
<p><b>By Andy Fautheree</b></p> 
<p><b>SUN Columnist</b></p> 
<p>It was great pleasure to meet so many veterans attending the 9Health Fair 
Saturday at the high school. This was the third year I have had a table at the 
fair.</p> 
<p>Sharing my table were representatives from Homelake Veterans Home in Monte 
Vista. Vickie Olson, admissions director, and Juan Gomez, member of Homelake 
Board of Directors, were on hand to advise veterans and their families about 
Homelake. It is the nearest full-service Veterans' Home, offering assisted 
living and full 24/7 patient care for veterans and their qualified family 
members.</p> 
<p><b>Many veterans attend</b> </p> 
<p>I lost track of how many veterans I was able to visit with. </p> 
<p>There were several new veterans I had not met before who stopped by. Others 
stopped by with information to update their VA Health Care eligibility. Others 
just stopped by to say hi. Seems like I was so busy with interviews I noticed 
several just waved hi and went on with their 9Health Care screenings. </p> 
<p>I was able to fill out VA health care applications right on the spot with 
my trusty laptop computer. For others, we filled out their annual financial 
&quot;Means Test&quot; to keep them up to date in the VA health care system.</p>
<p><b>Taking care of health</b></p> 
<p>It is so gratifying to see our citizens, especially our veterans, take 
advantage of this very important community program of providing health care 
screenings. Many are enrolled in VA health care and receive good care through 
that benefit, but it never hurts to also obtain assistance and information at 
9Health Fair. The cost certainly is very affordable for most people.</p> 
<p><b>VSO spring training</b> </p> 
<p>April 19-23 I will be attending the annual Colorado Division of Veterans 
Affairs spring training conference. The Archuleta County Veterans' Service 
Office will be closed during this period.</p> 
<p>I will have the opportunity at the conference to learn about the latest VA 
benefits and claims processes, new regulations and the latest procedures.</p> 
<p>It's always a lot of information to absorb, but certainly very important to 
keep abreast of the latest information so that I can provide the best 
assistance to our veterans and their families.</p> 
<p>For information on these and other veterans' benefits please call or stop 
by the Archuleta County Veterans' Service Office on the lower floor of the 
county courthouse. The office number is 264-8375, the fax number is 264-8376, 
and e-mail is afautheree@archuletacounty.org. The office is open 8 a.m.-4 p.m., 
Monday through Thursday, Friday by appointment. Bring your DD Form 214 
(Discharge) for registration with the county, application for VA programs, and 
for filing in the VSO office.</p>

<p> </p> <b>Arts Line</b> 
<p><b>Rail veterans have works on display</b></p> 
<p><b>By Leanne Goebel</b></p> 
<p><b>PREVIEW Columnist</b></p> 
<p>Jeff Ellingson and John Coker create detailed watercolor canvases of 
quaking aspen leaves, roaring mountain streams, snow-capped San Juan peaks - 
and trains, steam engines belching billowing clouds of black smoke while 
pulling passenger cars, lumber, ore and bright red locomotives.</p> 
<p>Jay Wimer captures in photographs the last run of Engine 488, the grizzled 
faces of conductors and engineers after a long day on the rails, or a train 
crossing a trellis somewhere on Cumbres Pass.</p> 
<p>Ellingson, a Durango resident since 1970, attended Ft. Lewis College before 
finishing his art degree in Interior Design at the Colorado Institute of Art in 
Denver. He returned to Durango and worked as a graphic artist and ran the sign 
shop for Art Works. In 1981 he designed the logo for the Durango &amp; 
Silverton Narrow Gauge Railroad which adorns T-shirts, caps, brochures and all 
railroad advertising materials. In 1983, Ellingson designed the poster for the 
Telluride Bluegrass Festival.</p> 
<p>It is Ellingson's 20 years with the D&amp;SNG that shaped his art career 
the most. Today he is a man of all trades: conductor, brakeman, fireman, museum 
manager, restoration artist. That interior design degree comes in handy when he 
is restoring passenger cars and private cars like the No. 37 owned by Al 
Harper. Ellingson not only designs the cars, but he gets in there and hangs 
wallpaper and lighting fixtures and paints the lettering on the outside of cars 
and engines.</p> 
<p>In 1997 the D&amp;SNG opened a museum in the building across the railroad 
tracks from the depot. Filled with artifacts and memorabilia, including the 
pale green boxcar used in the film Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, the 
museum traces the history of the narrow gauge railroad. Ellingson manages this 
museum and the one in Silverton. Several of Ellingson's original watercolor 
paintings, owned by the railroad, are on display at the museum.</p> 
<p>Ellingson paints meticulous and accurate renderings of historical trains. 
He completes four paintings a year and is currently working two years out on 
seven commissions for private collectors. It's a rare treat to see his work 
outside of the D&amp;SNG museums or a private home. Two unframed Ellingson 
prints are available for purchase for $39.95 each</p> 
<p>John Coker spent 30 years as a brakeman, fireman and engineer for the 
Cumbres &amp; Toltec Scenic Railroad and the Durango &amp; Silverton Narrow 
Gauge Railroad. During the long winter layoffs he developed his artistic 
talents painting the trains, the mountains and scenery through which he 
traveled during the summer.</p> 
<p>Coker is animated as he discusses his original paintings and the technique 
he uses to get those quaking aspen leaves to come alive on the canvas. He works 
from photographs to create his canvases, occasionally combining two photos into 
one detailed painting.</p> 
<p>Coker's work is widely exhibited and collected in Colorado, California and 
New Mexico. Several original paintings plus numerous framed signed and numbered 
prints of Coker's work are available for purchase during this exhibit.</p> 
<p>Wimer has dedicated the past four years of his life to preserving the 
Cumbres &amp; Toltec Railroad that runs from Chama, New Mexico to Antonito, 
Colorado. He credits the team of shop crews and operations staff for helping 
him create his photographs.</p> 
<p>Ellingson, Coker and Wimer are the featured artists in an exhibit which 
opened April 1 at the Pagosa Springs Arts Council Gallery in Town Park. The 
exhibit will remain on display until April 28.</p> 
<p>Call the council at 264-5020 for hours or Richard Goebel at 731-1841 to 
schedule a viewing appointment. </p> 
<p><b>Acting workshop</b></p> 
<p>Felicia Lansbury Meyer will instruct a three-week acting workshop for teens.
</p> 
<p>Lansbury-Meyer is a Los Angeles performer and filmmaker who has worked on 
stage in New York, Los Angeles and Europe and has appeared in numerous 
television roles. She received her MFA in Directing from the American Film 
Institute, where she directed the award-winning short film &quot;Desert 
Snow.&quot; She has taught previous acting workshops in Pagosa Springs and Sun 
Valley, Idaho, and directed &quot;An Evening of Shorts - Revelations&quot; for 
FoPA in Pagosa Springs last year.</p> 
<p>In her youth workshops, she emphasizes fostering individuality and 
leadership, as well as teaching the skills necessary to listen, communicate and 
collaborate.</p> 
<p>This workshop will focus on aspects of creating character, using 
objectives, being present, listening, memorization and blocking in a 
contemporary scene. There will be an informal presentation of scenes at the end 
of the session. </p> 
<p>The workshop will run June 7-25, Mon-Wed-Fri, 3-5:30 p.m., in the community 
center. Cost is $125. Class size is limited.</p> 
<p>For more information, contact Pagosa Springs Arts Council, 264-5020 or

<p><b>Symphony sets final concerts in series</b></p> 
<p>Concluding on a high note, the San Juan Symphony brings its Blazing Trails 
series to an end April 17-18.</p> 
<p>The orchestra climaxes its season with Farmington and Durango performances.
</p> 
<p>These concerts include music by visionary composers, works that have blazed 
trails through the course of music history.</p> 
<p>The program opens with Beethoven's &quot;Coriolan Overture,&quot; probably 
the first piece of concert music intended to tell a detailed story without 
words. The composer was inspired by the arguments concerning justice, freedom 
and democracy that often moved him.</p> 
<p>After moving the crowd with Beethoven's great spirit, the audience will be 
treated to the work of Igor Stravinsky, controversial in his day. While rioting 
in the streets no longer accompanies Stravinsky music, listeners will be 
treated to his &quot;The Fair&quot; from the &quot;Petrouchka&quot; ballet. 
There is little in musical history equaling the innovation of Stravinsky's 
ballets.</p> 
<p>The program's first half concludes with a groundbreaker in the series theme 
- John Adams' minimalist &quot;Lollapalooza.&quot; And it's just that, an 
orchestral treat. This American word suggests something large, outlandish, not 
unduly refined.</p> 
<p>Following intermission, audiences will hear one of the region's favorite 
pianists, Norman Krieger, playing the massive Brahms' &quot;Concerto No. 
2.&quot;</p> 
<p>Durango concert goers are directed to FLC Community Concert Hall 7:30 p.m. 
April 17. A few single reserved seats range from $5 for children to $25 for 
adults. Call the box office at 247-7657 for tickets.</p> 
<p>Good seats are available in the Farmington Civic Center 3 p.m. April 18. 
Prices range from $5 for children/students to $20 for adults. For Farmington 
tickets call (505) 599-1148.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><b>Springfest for kids features full slate of fun activities</b></p>

<p><b>Writers' workshop planned April 18</b></p> 
<p>Local writers are invited to join C. J. Hannah for a writer's workshop at 
noon April 18.</p> 
<p>Each writer is given 20-30 minutes to read aloud and then 30 minutes is 
spent hearing feedback from other writers that focuses on the craft of writing 
only, i.e., characterization, plot, setting.</p> 
<p>The basic philosophy of Hannah's workshop is &quot;How can I help make this 
better?&quot; He's fine-tuned his workshop method over many years and is an 
amazing and on-target critic.</p> 
<p>Writer Susan Vreeland, who dedicated her current book &quot;The Forest 
Lover&quot; to Hannah, sums it up on her Web site.</p> 
<p>&quot;My real learning came when I joined the Asilomar Writers' Consortium, 
a serious fiction critique group led by C. Jerry Hannah. This was not one of 
those pat-ourselves-on-the-back hobbyist groups. Here was criticism I could 
depend on, a disciplined format of reading our work aloud without defending it, 
but listening to an ordered and insightful response by writers who had the best 
interest of the work at heart. Working with this group for a dozen years has 
provided a sound alternative for an academic program.&quot;</p> 
<p>If you are interested in participating in this opportunity, contact Leanne 
Goebel at 731-1841 for more information and directions to the workshop.</p>

<p><b>High school cast prepares its version of 'Fame, The Musical'</b></p> 
<p><b>By Lisa Hartley</b></p> 
<p><b>Special to the PREVIEW</b></p> 
<p>Pagosa Springs High School will present &quot;Fame, The Musical&quot; April 
22-24.</p> 
<p>&quot;Fame The Musical,&quot; which follows two successful predecessors - 
the hit movie and the television series - focuses on the last class to graduate 
from New York's High School of the Performing Arts on 46th Street before the 
school relocated to Lincoln Center.</p> 
<p>&quot;Fame, The Musical,&quot; with book by Jose Fernandez, and a score by 
composer Steven Margoshes and lyricist Jacques Levy, tells an insightful and 
exciting story about the passions and dedication shared by a group of young 
people with exceptional artistic gifts.</p> 
<p>The show documents the prayers, hopes and ambitions of a group of committed 
and talented streetwise students as they work to develop their unique talents 
with the encouragement of a supportive faculty. We learn about the temptations 
facing these aspiring dancers, actors and musicians, their need for values and 
the importance of discipline in their lives as they confront issues ranging 
from illiteracy to drug abuse.</p> 
<p>We stay with them through four years of intense involvement with their art, 
following their frustrations and their triumphs from the first day of their 
freshman year until graduation. &quot;Fame&quot; had its world premiere at the 
Coconut Grove Playhouse in Miami in 1989.</p> 
<p>The show will start at 7 p.m. Thursday, Friday and Saturday with a 1 p.m. 
matinee Saturday. Advance ticket sales are available in the high school office 
and at the Plaid Pony. Ticket prices are $6 for adults and $4 for students, 
elementary through high school.</p> 
<p>Principal actors include: Brandon Samples as Nick; Hattie Mayne as Serena; 
Tim McAlister as Joe; Jesse Morris as Tyrone; Amber Farnham as Carmen; Cindy 
Neder as Iris; Randi Andersen as Mabel; Chris Baum as Schlomo; Veronica Zeiler 
as Lambchops; Joe Quick as Goody; Danae Holloman as Miss Sherman; Christine 
Morrison as Ms. Bell; Michael Spitler as Mr. Myers; and Ryan Versaw as Mr. 
Scheinkopf.</p> 
<p>Dancers in the performance include: Katie Vowles, Liesl Jackson, Matt 
DeWinter, Taryn Burnett, Tiffany Mayne, Ben DeVoti, Havi Kornhaber, Chelsea 
Taylor, Anna Hershey, Kelly Johnson, Angelica Leslie, Jenna Finney, Esther 
Gordon, David Smith and Darran Garcia.</p> 
<p>The musicians include: Kyle Peterzen, Heather Hooper, Kelly Crow, Sara 
Baum, Shiloh Baker, Shanti Johnson and Shannon Baker.</p>

<p> </p> <b>Education News</b> 
<p><b>Half, full-day kindergarten sign-ups set</b></p> 
<p>Beginning next school year both half-day and full-day kindergarten classes 
will be offered at Pagosa Springs Elementary School, pending school board 
approval.</p> 
<p>Because funding by the state is available only for the half-day classes, 
full-day sessions will be on a tuition basis, but at half tuition level because 
of a special grant.</p> 
<p>The tuition price is $150 a month and there are 40 slots open. If there is 
higher demand, the slots will be filled by lottery drawing.</p> 
<p>Kindergarten registration will begin April 26 and continue through May 21. 
Please bring a copy of a child's birth certificate, immunization records and 
his/her Social Security number. Parents will not be able to register their 
child without these items.</p> 
<p>Parents may request full day or half day (morning or afternoon) at this 
time.</p> 
<p>The morning and afternoon slots will be filled as students are registered. 
There will be waiting lists for any slots filled. For the full- day class, a 
$100 deposit is required at registration.</p> 
<p>School officials say a half-day schedule can be a low stress way to ease a 
child into the school routine, noting a student may be away from home for the 
first time and a half-day experience could be the best.</p> 
<p>Parents, they added, may not be ready to send their child to school for a 
full day, preferring to spend extra time with the child for one final year.</p> 
<p>And, a student may still need a nap or later wake up time at this age. Each 
child is unique.</p> 
<p>A full-day kindergarten schedule allows for additional activities to enrich 
the variety and depth of the younger child's education experience.</p> 
<p>There is more time to give individualized attention to students. A full-day 
schedule helps parents manage their day between family and work.</p> 
<p>And, in the full-day concept, students have additional time to process the 
concepts being taught.</p>

<p><b>Students speak at annual ed center luncheon</b></p> 
<p><b>The By Livia Cloman Lynch</b></p> 
<p><b>SUN Columnist</b></p> 
<p>The Archuleta County Education Center would like to say thank you to the 
student speakers at our annual Making A Difference Luncheon held recently at 
the First Baptist Church..</p> 
<p>Crystal Snow and Luke Brinton, both seniors at our alternative high school, 
the Archuleta County High School (ACHS), shared their personal insights.</p> 
<p>Crystal shared stories about how the flexibility in the program allows many 
students to successfully complete either a high school diploma or GED. She 
talked about the opportunities for students to take day or evening classes, 
work-study combinations or to do independent study. Some of the students' needs 
that she highlighted in her talk were students who are also parents or are 
living on their own.</p> 
<p>The second student speaker, Luke Brinton, transferred to ACHS this past 
fall from Pagosa Springs High School.</p> 
<p>Luke shared his personal educational experiences during the past 12 years. 
Luke spoke about how everyone learns differently and that there should be 
educational opportunities for everyone regardless of their learning styles. 
Luke shared how ACHS provides individualized programs to meet each student's 
needs.</p> 
<p>Rosalie Martinez was our third speaker at the fund-raising event. Rosalie 
is a student in our Adult Education program and she shared her personal 
experiences after returning to school this past fall to complete her GED.</p> 
<p>Rosalie's heartfelt talk was an inspiration to all who had the privilege of 
hearing her speak.</p> 
<p>Thank you Rosalie, Luke and Crystal for representing all of our 1,046 
students at the Making A Difference Luncheon.</p> 
<p>The Archuleta County Education Center has been making a difference in 
Archuleta County since 1989. We see lives changing and doors of opportunity 
opening for our students. Give us a call at 264-2835 or stop by and see us at 
Lewis and 4th streets for more information about any of our education programs.

<p> </p> <b>Cruising with Cruse</b> 
<p><b>Daffodils, Easter eggs and don't forget the candy</b></p> 
<p><b>By Katherine Cruse</b></p> 
<p><b>SUN Columnist</b></p> 
<p>Spring is springing, jerkily. The weather is jerky. Last weekend it didn't 
know whether to rain or snow. It's hard to decide what to do, ski or raft.</p> 
<p>As I drove east with my skis I passed a vehicle heading west with kayaks 
mounted on top.</p> 
<p>Here in Pagosa Country, we can really appreciate the little signs of spring.
</p> 
<p>Daffodils. New tiny leaves on the potentilla. Bluebirds checking out the 
boxes. Horses shedding their winter coats and nibbling tiny new grass shoots. 
Any month now the tips of the scrub oak twigs will be swelling with new growth.
</p> 
<p>After four years living here, last fall Hotshot and I planted daffodils 
around the S Bar S place. I was inspired by the acre or so of yellow blooms I 
once saw under the aspen trees near the late Betty Feazel's home on At Last 
Ranch.</p> 
<p>I've put off planting flowers, shrubs, anything that needs water or 
attention. Out here in the meadows the color and movement of the dryland 
grasses are beautiful enough, and flower beds seemed superfluous. When we moved 
here I told Hotshot, &quot;No flower beds.&quot; He said, &quot;Okay, that's 
fine. But, could we have a little color around the place?&quot; It was just a 
little failure to communicate.</p> 
<p>Another deterrent to planting, besides my laziness, has been the deer. Why 
move into deer habitat and plant things they like to eat, just so you can get 
angry at the deer for eating them? Things like roses. And tulips. And they can 
eat some of those in a hurry. A friend back in Tennessee went out one bright 
noontime to walk down her long driveway and collect the mail. On the way she 
paused to admire a row of tulips that were newly opened.</p> 
<p>By the time she came back from the mailbox, a passing deer had admired the 
same tulips and neatly plucked the heads off every stalk.</p> 
<p>You probably have similar stories.</p> 
<p>But daffodils are safe, we've been told. Deerproof.</p> 
<p>We started small, with a bag of 30 bulbs. I planted half under the scrub 
oak around the base of a birdhouse. Hotshot planted the other half between the 
shrubs that he put in beside the house. Guess what? They're coming up. They're 
blooming. Bright bold bits of yellow in an otherwise brown landscape.</p> 
<p>I'm astounded.</p> 
<p>My gardening friends in lower and warmer climes tell me that their crocuses 
came up weeks ago. All the spring bulbs are just about finished. They're about 
to start major planting projects, like one friend who bought 50 - count 'em, 50 
- asparagus plants. They'll soon be shifting into summer, and we're just 
starting to see the end of winter.</p> 
<p>And since next Sunday is Easter, some of us will be purchasing extra 
cartons of eggs and packages of dye. We'll be getting the candy ready for those 
baskets. Well, I won't, but you might. We'll be checking out the chocolate 
bunnies and the sugar eggs, the kind with the window in the end and the tiny 
scene inside.</p> 
<p>How was the Easter basket situation handled in your family? At my house, 
the basket contained candy. The eggs were hidden around the house, tucked in 
shoes, reclining in bookcases. However, they were not in little individual 
grass nests, like someone else recalled for me. Hotshot says that in his family 
the eggs were already in the decorated baskets. No hunting required.</p> 
<p>A few years ago we attended a reunion of old college friends. It happened 
to be over Easter weekend. &quot;Are we going to dye eggs?&quot; I asked the 
person hosting us. I meant it as a joke. &quot;Of course,&quot; she said. And 
all that Saturday, as we gathered at the house, she insisted that everyone dye 
at least a couple of eggs. Then came Easter morning, after the late night 
partying.</p> 
<p>Someone hid the eggs around the back yard. Having no baskets, we went out 
with assorted bowls, pots, a colander. I think someone used a hat. We squealed 
like children at each find. We jealously counted each other's eggs.</p> 
<p>We had a great time.</p> 
<p>One of my persistent Easter memories is of being at my grandfather's farm 
one year, when my cousin and I tiptoed out of the house early in the morning 
and went to check out the rabbits in their hutches. One of the does had brand 
new babies. True Easter bunnies. We were enthralled. We were stroking their 
tiny hairless bodies, marveling at the new life, when suddenly our grandfather 
yelled at us, &quot;Get away from there! Leave those rabbits alone.&quot;</p> 
<p>Okay, it's not a perfect memory. But here's the big question: how did 
bunnies and eggs and candy come to be associated with the religious holiday of 
Easter?</p> 
<p>Rabbits and hares are associated with spring, and with new life, with 
fertility, around the world. Eggs are another obvious symbol of new life.</p> 
<p>Long before the Common Era dyed and decorated eggs were given as a 
celebration of spring.</p> 
<p>And how did they get together? Why do we have this myth of a big ol'&#146; 
bunny bringing baskets filled with candy and eggs and, in the old days, baby 
chicks? Just who laid those eggs, anyway? I'm pretty sure it's not the rabbit.
</p> 
<p>The association of eggs with the Easter Bunny is apparently pretty recent, 
starting maybe 100 years ago. It seems to be the result of efforts by European 
candy makers to advertise their product. They matched up two traditional 
symbols and sweetened the pot, or the basket, with candy.</p> 
<p>And that's why the Easter Bunny brings you a basket of dyed eggs. And candy.
</p> 
<p>Don't forget the candy.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p> </p> <b>Local Chatter</b> 
<p><b>Turkey hunting on the Bluebonnet Trail</b></p> 
<p><b>By Kate Terry</b></p> 
<p><b>SUN Columnist</b></p> 
<p>A relative told me that another relative was going turkey hunting in Texas 
and needed company on the trip.</p> 
<p>I didn't pass up that invite because I like Mason. It's where my brother 
and his wife winter - on a ranch complete with a yard full of cardinals and 
white tail deer who come from the surrounding woods every evening to feed on 
corn.</p> 
<p>Mason is called the Gem of the Hill Country, a good description for this 
charming community of 3,000 people.</p> 
<p>The Texas Hill Country is an area loosely defined as that between San 
Angelo, Austin and San Antonio. The rolling hills are noted for bluebonnets, 
flowers that bloom between the middle of March and most of April. To see a 
field blanketed with bluebonnets and a road edged with them is a spectacular 
sight. People make annual pilgrimages to the Hill Country to travel the 
Bluebonnet Trail.</p> 
<p>Mason's history is far from boring. It was settled by English and Germans 
who had their differences - something to do with cattle rustling that resulted 
in the famous Hoo Doo Wars, 1875-1876, a time when Mason had more murders than 
any other county in the state. It is rumored that to this day there are still 
more unsolved murders than any other Texas county.</p> 
<p>And with tongue in cheek I report another war.</p> 
<p>First of all, a new version of &quot;The Alamo&quot; is hitting the movie 
theaters. John Lee Hancock's version differs from John Wayne's romantic 
version, if you would believe the reviews.</p> 
<p>Anyway, apparently some woman wrote a letter to the San Antonio 
Express-News saying, &quot;Anglos in the Alamo were illegal aliens breaking the 
law.&quot; Now I didn't see the letter but did see some of those who fired back.
</p> 
<p>The newspaper described the letters as &quot;Readers disagree whether the 
Alamo defenders were thieves or fighters.&quot;</p> 
<p>A sign on the kitchen wall of this ranch house where I'm staying says, 
&quot;I only have a kitchen 'cause it came with the house.&quot; So it's time 
to go home - so I think!</p> 
<p><b>Around town</b></p> 
<p>Just a reminder that tickets are now on sale at the Chamber of Commerce 
Visitor Center for this summer's three Music in the Mountains classical music 
concerts. All tickets are $35, the same price as last summer - a wonderful 
bargain when you consider what it costs to go to a similar event in Boston, 
Houston or New York.</p> 
<p>The concerts will take place Friday evenings at 7 p.m. at BootJack Ranch on 
U.S. 160 east of Pagosa Springs, thanks to the generosity of David and Carol 
Brown, owners of the ranch.</p> 
<p>July 23 pianist Aviram Reichert will perform works including Schumann's 
Piano Quintet with several members of the Dallas and Baltimore symphonies. July 
30 Antonio Pompa-Baldi will perform solo and then join his wife Emanuela 
Friscioni, also an award-winning pianist, in piano for four-hands selections. 
Aug. 6 we'll hear Anne-Marie McDermott on piano and Philippe Quint playing the 
violin.</p> 
<p>In past years, the concerts have sold out well before the event, so I 
recommend that you buy your tickets as soon as possible.</p> 
<p><b>Fun on the run</b></p> 
<p>More test results from high school students.</p> 
<p>&quot;Writing at the same time as Shakespeare was Miguel Cervantes. He 
wrote Donkey Hote. The next great author was John Milton. Milton wrote Paradise 
Lost. Since then no one ever found it.&quot;</p> 
<p>&quot;Delegates from the original 13 states formed the Contented Congress. 
Thomas Jefferson, a Virgin and Benjamin Franklin were singers of the 
Declaration of Independence. Franklin discovered electricity by rubbing two 
cats backward and also declared, 'A horse divided against itself cannot stand.' 
He was a naturalist for sure. Franklin died in 1790 and is still dead.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Abraham Lincoln became America's greatest Precedent. Lincoln's mother 
died in infancy, and he was born in a log cabin which he built with his own 
hands. Abraham Lincoln freed the slaves by signing the Emasculation 
Proclamation. On the night of April 14, 1865, Lincoln went to the theater and 
got shot in his seat by one of the actors in a moving picture show. They 
believe the assinator was John Wilkes Booth, a supposingly insane actor. This 
ruined Booth's career.&quot;</p> 
<p>&quot;Johann Bach wrote a great many musical compositions and had a large 
number of children. In between he practiced on the old spinster which he kept 
up in his attic. Bach died from 1750 to the present. Bach was the most famous 
composer in the world and so was Handel. Handel was half German, half Italian 
and half English. He was very large.&quot;</p> 
<p>&quot;Beethoven wrote music even though he was deaf. He was so deaf that he 
wrote loud music and became the father of rock and roll. He took long walks in 
the forest even when everyone was calling for him. Beethoven expired in 1827 
and later died for this.&quot;</p>

<p><b>WNV vaccination</b></p> 
<p>While some speculate the Western Slope may be hardest hit this year by West 
Nile Virus, one thing remains clear: horse owners across the state should 
vaccinate their animals.</p> 
<p>&quot;Last year alone, Colorado led the nation with 604 horses testing 
positive for the disease,&quot; stated Colorado State Veterinarian Wayne 
Cunningham. &quot;Vaccination and controlling mosquito populations are still 
the most effective tools in preventing West Nile Virus in horses, but owners 
with questions should discuss it with their local veterinarians.&quot;</p> 
<p>Horses that have been vaccinated in past years will need an annual booster 
shot this spring. However, if an owner did not vaccinate their animal in 
previous years, the horse will need the two-shot vaccination series within a 
three- to six-week period. Statistics show that of the unvaccinated horses 
exhibiting clinical signs from the infection, one in three will most likely die.
</p> 
<p>Humans, horses and companion animals will benefit if owners control 
mosquito populations on their property. Officials recommend eliminating 
standing pools of water where mosquitoes breed and using mosquito larvicide 
products. Owners should also keep their animals inside during the morning and 
evening hours when mosquitoes are most likely to be active.</p> 
<p>&quot;Unfortunately, there is no WNV vaccination at this time for companion 
animals such as cats and dogs,&quot; said Cunningham. &quot;They are also 
susceptible to the disease and concerned owners should consult with their 
veterinarians if their pets are exhibiting unusual symptoms.&quot;</p> 
<p>West Nile Virus can cause an inflammation of the brain and spinal cord and 
was first discovered in the United States in September of 1999 in a dead bird.
</p> 
<p>Mosquitoes transmit the disease and infected horses may display symptoms 
including head tilt, muscle tremors, stumbling, lack of coordination, weakness 
of the limbs or partial paralysis.</p> 
<p>The department's Rocky Mountain Regional Animal Health Laboratory can test 
equine serum for West Nile Virus. The fee is $5.75 per sample with results 
within 48 hours. Samples must be sent to CDA-RMRAHL, 2331 W. 31st Ave., Denver, 
CO 80211.</p>

<p> </p> <b>Food for Thought</b> 
<p><b>No reward for Mr. Nice Guy</b></p> 
<p><b>By Karl Isberg</b></p> 
<p><b>SUN Columnist</b></p> 
<p>I'm the nicest person I've ever known.</p> 
<p>I've been this way for a three and a half weeks.</p> 
<p>It's almost a month since Kathy had surgery. Rotator cuff. Painful, 
incapacitating stuff.</p> 
<p>Before she went under the knife, I took a hard look at what a jerk I am and 
resolved to change in order to facilitate my wife's recovery.</p> 
<p>And change I did. Overnight, I became Karl Isberg, nurse and saint: The 
Florence Nightingale of the southern San Juans. The nicest person I've ever 
known.</p> 
<p>I plunged into my new duties with max enthusiasm.</p> 
<p>The new me ferried Kathy to and from the hospital for pre-op work; I was 
there for the surgery and in the recovery room. I took her to doctor's 
appointments, I gave her pain medication, I tended to her every need.</p> 
<p>Each day, I tidied her up and dressed her; I dosed her with pain 
medication. I made ice packs for her; I helped her in and out of the sling for 
her arm; I scurried up and down stairs fetching and toting; I cooked soup and 
procured gelatin dessert treats. I dosed her with pain medication. I did the 
laundry, washed the dishes.</p> 
<p>The first two weeks, I changed her bandages twice daily, swathing her 
shoulder, protecting my precious love bunny from infection. I was 
hyperdiligent; there was so much gauze and tape on Kathy she looked like she 
was auditioning for a part in a revival of &quot;The Mummy.&quot;</p> 
<p>I fetched potions and teas, dosed her with pain medication, did all the 
household chores, came home from work to make lunch, took care of Arnie. When 
it came time to cart Kathy to physical therapy, I did it. At the end of each 
day, after I dosed her with pain medication, I was exhausted, but satisfied.</p>
<p>Not only was I helping my wife in a time of great need, I was a good person 
as well. The nicest I've ever known.</p> 
<p>I was selfless. And that's saying something: An egomaniac has to be very 
careful of creating a void. Nature abhors a vacuum.</p> 
<p>The third week after surgery, Kathy was making tremendous progress.</p> 
<p>I went to the pharmacy to refill her prescription for pain medication.</p> 
<p>Her therapist, Mark, was super-optimistic; he told Kathy she was way ahead 
of schedule, she could return to work. He told me, in a well-practiced 
professional way, that using $30 worth of gauze and tape each day on Kathy's 
wounds was unnecessary.</p> 
<p>So, she went back to work. I made Kathy her breakfast every morning, dosed 
her with pain medication, helped her get ready, loaded her stuff (including 
some pain medication) in a rolling suitcase and delivered her to the high 
school.</p> 
<p>I was the nicest person I've ever known.</p> 
<p>Then, as the fourth week of the process neared an end, it happened. It was 
inevitable, I suppose, but I never saw it coming. That's the problem with being 
extra nice - you're oblivious to reality.</p> 
<p>Kathy started to feel better. Not well enough to do everything for herself, 
and not well enough to drive herself around. Oh no, I was still needed.</p> 
<p>But she was more energetic. In a nutshell - she - didn't want the pain 
meds, and she was ready to take account of how to live a better life.</p> 
<p>This is an old story, isn't it? A person undergoes a trauma, begins the 
healing process, takes stock of things. How can I live my life in a more 
healthy, productive way, they ask, what dramatic changes can I make?</p> 
<p>It's the next step I should have seen coming.</p> 
<p>And how, asked Kathy, can Karl live his life in a more healthy and 
productive way as well?</p> 
<p>I suppose I deserved it.</p> 
<p>While Kathy was feeling poorly and under the influence of massive amounts 
of pain medication, she was a real lamb peach. I admit I liked her that way and 
I got away with murder. After I dosed Kathy with the meds, I cooked and ate all 
sorts of things she would normally object to and, in her semi-delirious state, 
she ate and enjoyed them: macaroni with four cheeses, medium rare meats nearly 
every night, puddings, chile in darned near everything, tons of butter, cream. 
As an added bonus, she was too far gone to notice what I watched on TV. I 
enjoyed an entire Cops marathon and four solid hours of Cheaters and not once 
did she utter as much as a peep. After a couple caplets I even got her to agree 
that Paris Hilton is the most talented actress to hit the scene in decades. I 
used the credit card to order the video.</p> 
<p>The healing gets underway, her head clears, no more meds: Paradise lost.</p>
<p>Oh, I'm still toting stuff, driving places I don't want to go, fetching 
cold packs and helping with the sling and the garments. I'm rubbing Kathy's 
back and applying lotion to dry skin. I'm changing the bandages. But now, 
instead of &quot;Karlahmmpfeerringtbeh &#138;&quot; I hear &quot; Turn the 
channel, that noise is bothering me, I hate the sound of sirens. No more meat 
this week, we've eaten too much red meat. Oh, and no more cheese, no more dairy 
products - I'm starting to experience severe congestion. Tonight, we're going 
vegetarian and I want you to make that ratatouille-like stuff with brown rice. 
In fact, let's try to stay vegetarian for the foreseeable future. We need to 
cleanse our systems.&quot;</p> 
<p>I comply. I am a nice person. Cleansing is an excellent idea, isn't it?</p> 
<p>I cook up a batch of brown rice and set it off to cool.</p> 
<p>I sweat rough-chopped white onion, minced shallot, and chopped red and 
green peppers in olive oil. When they're soft, I remove them from the pan. I 
add more oil and saut&eacute; cubed eggplant, adding chopped zucchini when the 
eggplant begins to soften. I chuck in some oregano, basil, a bit of thyme and 
several seeded, chopped Roma tomatoes. As everything melds, I throw in a batch 
of minced garlic and add the onion and pepper mix. I cheat on the vegetarian 
program by splashing in a bit of chicken stock and I pour in some tomato juice. 
I cook the mess for a while, adding salt, fresh ground black pepper and a bit 
of freshly squeezed lemon juice and a smidge of honey. I taste, add a touch of 
chile powder, a bit more of the herbs and spices and extra-virgin olive oil as 
needed. When most of the liquid has reduced to a syrupy consistency, I turn in 
a blob of the cooked brown rice - not too much, just enough to make the grain's 
presence known. The mix sits over low heat for a few minutes and, voila, its 
cleansing time.</p> 
<p>Since Kathy is on the anti-dairy warpath, I omit a desirable ingredient: 
freshly grated parmigiano-reggiano or a bit of grated asiago (if one is in a 
tart mood). For an instant, I consider crushing a few pain pills into Kathy's 
rice, but &#138;</p> 
<p>The dish goes well with a simple green salad and crusty bread. </p> 
<p>But the good times are over for Florence Nightingale.</p> 
<p>As she recuperated, Kathy finished a book she ordered from the 
Deprive-Yourself-and-Live-Longer Book Club. The title is something like 
&quot;Cool down Your Brain, You're Way Too Hot.&quot; She has ideas.</p> 
<p>I finish doing the dishes and sweep the dog hair from the living room 
floor. I replace the cold pack on Kathy's shoulder and tie her shoes. I 
collapse on the couch to watch an episode of South Park when Kathy pipes up.</p>
<p>&quot;You know, I've been looking at you the last couple weeks and I sensed 
there's something different about you,&quot; she says. &quot;At first, I 
couldn't put my finger on it, probably because of the huge doses of pain 
medication you were giving me every few hours. But once I stopped taking the 
pills, all of a sudden it was clear. I saw you in profile and realized you're 
growing a fourth chin; the other three are completely full. Plus, how many days 
have you worn the same shirt and socks? And I can tell from your incredibly bad 
breath that you have another sinus infection. We need to do something about 
this, and right now, buster. Turn the sound off; you're taking a test.&quot;</p>
<p>She whips out her book about hot brains.</p> 
<p>She's baaaaaaaaack! And, Mr. Nice has no defenses. It's that void I 
referred to earlier.</p> 
<p>&quot;There are 150 questions here,&quot; she says. &quot;If the statement 
does not apply to your life at all, give it zero points. If it applies 
sometimes, give it one point. If it applies most of the time, give it two 
points. Answer honestly. At the end, I add up the points and figure out what 
supplements you need to take and which diet regimen you need to follow, 
depending on whether your brain is too hot or too cold.&quot;</p> 
<p>We slog through the list of questions: &quot;Do you have a family history 
of mania and/or high blood pressure?&quot; &quot;Would you rather sleep in a 
cold bedroom?&quot; &quot;Do you prefer large dogs or small?&quot; and the like.
</p> 
<p>I answer each one and Kathy changes my answers.</p> 
<p>I end up with a 59 in the hot brain category. I need adjustments, pronto. 
Kathy spells out the program.</p> 
<p>I do some quick math: The supplements will cost approximately $250 per 
month for at least eight months. The organic foods must be ordered from a 
special source in Palo Alto, California, and delivered by next-day courier. By 
my reckoning, once I am out of the starvation phase of the process, costs could 
total well over $2,000 per month. If I wasn't so nice, I would resist.</p> 
<p>&quot;As soon as I'm able to drive myself around town,&quot; says my 
sweetheart, &quot;you can get a part-time job on the graveyard shift at the 
convenience store. That fourth chin will be gone in no time, your sinuses will 
be clean as a whistle, and you'll have your energy back. Once we deal with your 
brain temperature, you'll be like new. Now that I'm not taking those pills, 
things are crystal clear. I'll manage everything. And, since you are a new 
person, you'll do everything I say, won't you?</p> 
<p>Yep.</p> 
<p>I need to change the sheets on the bed and put Kathy's special surgery-girl 
shirts in the washing machine. Then I have to mix up another isopropyl alcohol 
and water cold pack. I'll go to the store before it closes to buy a loaf of 
spelt bread so I can make toast for Kathy's breakfast.</p> 
<p>Kathy is well on the road to recovery. I'm still the nicest person I've 
ever known, but I've got four chins and I'm way too hot.</p> 
<p>I wonder if pain medication would help?</p>

<p><b>Running in the jungle alone: Not a good idea, but ... </b></p> 
<p><b>By Ming Steen</b></p> 
<p><b>SUN Columnist</b></p> 
<p>&quot;Did you just run through there alone?&quot;</p> 
<p>The Indonesian maid looked at me as if I were very dim. Tuti is a large 
woman of 38, very strong and very bold. She hails from the islands of East 
Timor, Indonesia, and has contracted to care for my mother.</p> 
<p>I was in Raub, in the central highland of Malaysia, visiting my mother. 
This small finger of land is surrounded by the South China Sea on one coast and 
the Indian Ocean on the other coast. White sand rings the peninsula, but the 
central highland is pure jungle. It wasn't uncommon for me to hear the crashing 
waddle of a 7-foot long monitor lizard escaping into the thick undergrowth when 
I ventured along the game trails for my early morning run.</p> 
<p>&quot;Yeah,&quot; I told Tuti, aware that sweat was flowing from my body as 
if I were a cloudburst unto myself. Malaysia is just a couple degrees north of 
the equator. The heat and humidity are off the charts. &quot;I like to run by 
myself.&quot;</p> 
<p>&quot;You shouldn't do that.&quot;</p> 
<p>&quot;I like to run alone. It helps clear my head.&quot;</p> 
<p>The run had lasted an hour. After leaving my mother's house, I picked up 
another trail, barely discernible, that went uphill through a portal into the 
jungle's thick shade. I'd established a loose rhythm and slowly increased my 
pace. The trails were spongy, except for the Banyan roots. The air was thick 
and wet, with the aromas of rot and growth combining for a fresh scent reeking 
of life itself. Too much life, maybe, for I could never totally relax. I kept 
my eyes glued to the trail, searching for the black cobra.</p> 
<p>A leaf touched my shoulder. It was a very small leaf, and its touch was no 
more than a slight tickle. But my senses were so heightened that I leapt in the 
air and anxiously brushed the imagined snake back into the bush.</p> 
<p>That's when I decided to head back. All in all, however, the run had been 
very calming. There's something primal about running through a jungle that 
centers me.</p> 
<p>&quot;It's not a good idea,&quot; Tuti insisted.</p> 
<p>&quot;Yeah, I know, but ...&quot;</p> 
<p>&quot;You see, the pythons that live in these jungles grow to be 30 feet 
long and as big around as this.&quot; Tuti held up two strong hands six inches 
apart, as if clutching an imaginary basketball. &quot;They only eat once a 
month, but when they get hungry, they go to a tree branch above the trails. 
When they hear an animal coming they drop ...&quot;</p> 
<p>Yes, they drop onto their prey. As if I don't know. I grew up in this part 
of the country. Did she think I was some dumb tourist?</p> 
<p>Since the pythons weigh about 300 pounds, the python wraps it up, chokes it 
to death, then swallows it.</p> 
<p>In a nutshell, that's the Malaysian jungle running experience: a little 
danger, a little paradise, a little common sense. Running there is a slow 
confrontation of personal fears.</p> 
<p>I only hope the jungle will always be there. Green and thick and beckoning, 
laced with leeches and cobras and those monstrous pythons. Huge sections of 
these panoramas of trees and vines and insects and noise are being cleared to 
make room for progress. A ridiculously misplaced Swiss theme retreat already 
hangs on one slope of the jungle.</p> 
<p>Last Saturday's Eggstravaganza wasn't graced by little girls in pretty 
pastel-colored dresses. Last Saturday's Easter egg hunt was well attended by 
kids in Arctic-style coats, a gloves, caps and runny noses. That's spring for 
you in the Rockies.</p> 
<p>The PLPOA employees who organized the egg hunt would like to thank the fire 
protection district, Flame the clown and her buddy &quot;Frisky&quot; (who 
likes to frisk), the Archuleta County Sheriff's Department, the bunny, and 70 
tough kids for making it all worthwhile.</p> 
<p>May the joy of renewed life be yours this Easter.</p>

<p><b>Pirates break scoring drought, rip Ignacio 8-1 for first victory </b></p>
<p><b>By Richard Walter</b></p> 
<p><b>Staff Writer</b></p> 
<p>&quot;We'll hold back, no more helter-skelter attacks. We'll set the field 
for team attack and we'll create space, looking for open lanes.&quot;</p> 
<p>That was Coach Lindsey Kurt-Mason's pre-game prediction before his squad 
took the field Tuesday and surged to an 8-1 Pagosa Springs soccer victory over 
Ignacio at Golden Peaks Stadium.</p> 
<p>And the team fulfilled all the conditions he outlined ahead of time.</p> 
<p>In fact, after the game he was amazed by how well the team reacted to his 
game plan.</p> 
<p>&quot;They used their heads, not just offensively, but by playing smart and 
knowing ahead of time where the next pass should go,&quot; he said.</p> 
<p>The key to Pirate soccer success has always been teamwork and he got plenty 
of that Tuesday.</p> 
<p>It wasn't just the veterans who played well, he pointed out, but the huge 
corps of underclassmen performed as if they'd been in the program for years.</p>
<p>Still playing without veteran defender Kyrie Beye, cleared to practice 
while recovering from a broken bone in her leg but not yet ready for action, 
Kurt-Mason also had to add veteran Brett Garman to the injury list with a back 
muscle strain. </p> 
<p>The youth connection was evident early when freshman left wing Iris Frye 
broke containment, outraced a defender to the goal mouth, but missed the shot 
wide right less than three minutes into the contest.</p> 
<p>The Pirates got their initial score of the season at 6:58 with young Alaina 
Garman registering her first varsity marker.</p> 
<p>It came on an assist by senior attacker Melissa Diller who drove off a fake 
right and delivered a crossing pass with the left foot to the wide open Garman.
</p> 
<p>Ignacio, also a team in a rebuilding program under coach Duane Odoms, 
evened the score at 14:10 on a free kick by Emily Sanford from 14 yards after a 
Pirate handball in the box.</p> 
<p>It was to be the last major Ignacio threat.</p> 
<p>The Pirate teamwork mode espoused by Kurt-Mason soon became evident.</p> 
<p>Time and again one-touch-and-pass to the open player was the routine and 
after two misfires on offensive thrusts, freshman Laurel Reinhardt took a 
45-degree crossing pass from Frye all the way to the net for a 2-1 Pagosa lead 
at 26:08. A lead they would not surrender.</p> 
<p>Ignacio wasn't going to roll over and play dead for the Pirates and the 
Bobcats thwarted several Pagosa attacks, keeper Jamie Lucero stopping Diller 
twice and blanking Reinhardt on a breakaway.</p> 
<p>Then came the play which exhibited best the Pirate teamwork ethic in the 
game.</p> 
<p>It started innocently enough when Pirate sweeper Jenna Finney recorded her 
fifth block-takeaway of the game, looked downfield and saw Reinhardt breaking 
free.</p> 
<p>Her looping pass over the midfield grouping was right on target to the 
freshman. She bore down on Lucero from the right, faked a shot and then dropped 
a pass to the flying Diller who had Lucero out of position for the third Pagosa 
goal at 38:15. </p> 
<p>Less than two minutes later and just 15 seconds before the half ended, 
Reinhardt had another breakaway but Lucero made a great stop on a dive to her 
right to rob the freshman.</p> 
<p>But, just before the three-minute mark of the second half, Reinhardt got 
even, hiking the Pirate lead to 4-1 at 44:34 scoring unassisted on a steal and 
broken field jaunt through the defense to beat Lucero high to her left.</p> 
<p>Sanford, who had scored Ignacio's early tying goal, had an opportunity to 
hit the scoring column again at 51:40 but Pirate keeper Sierra Fleenor had the 
shot under control all the way.</p> 
<p>Just over three minutes later, Pirate junior Brittany Corcoran was wide 
right on a lead from senior Amy Tautges. The Ignacio outlet was intercepted by 
sophomore midfielder Caitlin Forrest and her crossing pass to Corcoran lifted 
the Pirate lead to 5-1 at 52:01.</p> 
<p>Less than two minutes later the crowd roared when Tautges' reverse kick 
from 30 yards appeared on target. But at the last minute it hooked just outside 
the pipes to the left. </p> 
<p>The lead went to 6-1 at 63:50 when Diller picked off a Bobcat lead just 
inside the midfield stripe. She cut left and 18 yards out reversed her field 
and went directly at Lucero for the goal.</p> 
<p>After Ignacio's Janelle Matthews had a shot go wide right just a minute 
later, Reinhardt scored again, on another three-person teamwork effort for 
Pagosa.</p> 
<p>This one began at midfield when junior Roxanne Lattin lifted a perfect 
looping lead to Diller cutting toward the left wing. Two touches and a crossing 
pass later, she had Reinhardt wide open at the goal mouth for the freshman's 
third goal, the team's seventh, at 72:32.</p> 
<p>But Reinhardt wasn't done.</p> 
<p>Four minutes later she was on the attack again, breaking right wing 
defense, but after faking the shot hit Jennifer Hilsabeck with an in-stride 
crossing pass and it was drilled in for the final goal of the game at 76:20.</p>
<p>The balance of the contest was the Fleenor show. The senior keeper 
withstood a spirited Ignacio flurry with a stop on a free kick from 20 yards, a 
diving catch of Sanford's bid for her second goal, and a stop of Annie Lucero's 
blast from 30 on a free kick.</p> 
<p>And Coach Kurt-Mason's game plan had been proven.</p> 
<p>Summary</p> 
<p>Scoring: 6:58, P-A. Garman, assist, Diller; 14:10, I-Sanford free kick; 
26:08, P-Reinhardt, assist Frye; 38:15, P-Diller, assists Reinhardt and Finney;

<p>The 2004 adult basketball leagues are beginning the playoff push this week. 
</p> 
<p>Round-robin play has ended and seeding for playoffs has been determined in 
all leagues with the exception of our men's competitive league which has one 
more regular season game on the schedule.</p> 
<p>The women's league semifinals began April 6 with Car Quest taking on 
Tequila's. The game was followed by the second semifinal contest, matching 
Jewell-Caroll Mortgage and Concrete Connection.</p> 
<p>The women's league championship will be played at 7 p.m. today in the 
upstairs gym at Pagosa Springs Junior High School.</p> 
<p>Last night, the men's competitive league playoffs began with quarter-final 
action at 6:30 p.m. followed by the second quarter-final at 7:45. Both games 
were played at the junior high school.</p> 
<p>Our men's recreation league playoff featuring three games begins tonight 
with a 6 p.m. encounter between S. C. &amp; C. and Citizen's Bank. The 7 p.m. 
game will feature Shot Callers against the Ruff Ryders ending with the 8 p.m. 
quarterfinal, American Legion against Lord's/Ponderosa/AYD. These games will 
also take place at Pagosa Springs Junior High School.</p> 
<p>The recreation department is looking forward to some spirited and 
sportsmanship-filled games. All teams are excited to begin playoffs and are set 
for their championship runs.</p> 
<p><b>Tee-ball program</b> </p> 
<p>Tee-ball is off and running with seven teams and over 60 participants ages 
5 and 6. Opening day was April 3 with all teams participating in spirited games.
</p> 
<p>Amazingly, all games ended in a tie, with every child celebrating with 
snacks and juice. Ah, wouldn't it be great if all recreation games were played 
in this manner. </p> 
<p>Also, the weather was not a deterrent for our Tee-ball league as we have 
set up games during the first part of our season in Pagosa Stadium (the gym in 
the community center). Everyone stayed dry and had a wonderful time.</p> 
<p>Tee-ball continues throughout the month of April with games scheduled 
outdoors as the weather allows. </p> 
<p><b>Baseball registration</b></p> 
<p>Registration began April 5 and will run through April 16. Applications were 
made available through all of the schools in Pagosa Springs with additional 
applications at Town Hall.</p> 
<p>Call Myles Gabel at 264-4151 Ext. 232 with any questions. Tentative start 
dates should be in early May. </p> 
<p><b>Girl's softball</b></p> 
<p>If you are interested in helping to develop girl's softball leagues in 
Pagosa Springs, please contact Myles Gabel at 264-4151 Ext. 232.</p> 
<p>We will have a meeting to discuss all options available for this exciting 
girl's youth league.</p> 
<p><b>Event planning</b></p> 
<p>Each year about this time we are faced with a rush of people planning and 
scheduling special events in town parks during the summer.</p> 
<p>You must reserve a town park if you need it for your event.</p> 
<p>We charge a user fee and collect a deposit, with all money collected going 
into the general fund to help us with maintenance and upkeep on our parks.</p> 
<p>Park rentals for weekend use in the summer are going fast so think ahead 
and call Parks and Recreation Director Joe Lister Jr. for availability. The 
number is 264-4151.</p> 
<p><b>We need volunteers</b> </p> 
<p>With the 2004 fireworks show being held at the Sports Complex this year, we 
are in need of all kinds of volunteers. Help with parking, entertainment, 
fireworks, food and security are needed. You can volunteer by calling 264-4151. 
</p> 
<p>Nonprofit service groups have a chance to make some money at the event; 
call to find out the details. </p> 
<p><b>New sports complex</b> </p> 
<p>We will know if we are recipients of a GoCo grant by June 3. We will start 
preparing the site with as much in-kind help as possible, and if we are lucky 
enough to receive the grant we will hit the ground running.</p> 
<p>Clean top soil and good fill dirt are needed for the new Sports Complex.

<p> </p> <b>Editorial</b> 
<p><b>A storm offshore</b> </p> 
<p>It was not long ago Rep. Mark Larson warned us that &quot;The Perfect </p> 
<p>Storm that everyone has been reading about has begun.&quot; At the </p> 
<p>time, Larson warned of impending, severe budget cuts that would adversely 
affect juvenile programs, state parks, higher education, and other areas. He 
saw the storm coming against the backdrop of two years of serious budget 
surgery and laid blame squarely on TABOR and Amendment 23.</p> 
<p>Well, the storm did not crash ashore with the ferocity expected and, no 
doubt, there are those who will castigate the naysayers, chide the doomsayers. 
The problem is they will most likely be wrong if they do so. Hurricanes have 
been known to change course before they come ashore to blow away the shanty.</p>
<p>Last week, the House approved a proposed $14 billion-plus budget and, on 
the surface, the waters seemed relatively calm. Supporters of TABOR will note 
nearly all state departments, with the exception of higher ed, experienced 
budget increases. In a way, that is true: The overall budget calls for a 4.4 
percent increase in spending. Departments will see funding equal to 2001-2002 
levels.</p> 
<p>The storm was avoided with smoke and mirrors. In order to return most state 
departments to 2001-2002 levels, the state has to borrow money from the 
education fund and use a one-time addition of $40 million from a tobacco 
lawsuit settlement.</p> 
<p>Most of us have not yet felt the wind pick up; cuts made during the past 
two years and the funding proposed this year have not yet had a profound 
effect. What has happened thus far in Pagosa Country will be felt by some of 
our local seniors. The local senior program could experience a cut of $14,000. 
The program is changing its meal delivery program, terminating paid personnel 
who deliver meals to the elderly and seeking volunteers to make deliveries. 
Senior bus hours have been reduced by one hour per day. The bus is used to 
transport seniors to stores and to medical appointments. Senior Center director 
Musetta Wollenweber gamely says &quot;We're surviving,&quot; but she awaits 
final word on possible cuts, worries that senior meal services could be changed 
in the future and plans fund-raisers as a cushion.</p> 
<p>The storm waits off shore, ready to hit other programs. With TABOR imposing 
restraints and Amendment 23 gobbling mandated revenue increases, with Medicaid 
costs going through the roof, with a high percentage of the state population 
reaching retirement age, with prison costs escalating and human services costs 
doing the same, the clock is ticking.</p> 
<p>Part of the solution is to demand lawmakers be fiscally responsible and 
restrained.</p> 
<p>A second way to deal with the problem should come in November, if citizens 
of the state vote on reasonable modifications to TABOR and Amendment 23.</p> 
<p>Last week, state Treasurer Mike Coffman advanced a plan to deal with the 
amendments. Coffman proposes creation of a rainy day fund to handle shortfalls 
when the economy turns down again - and it will. Second, ground lost during the 
last few years (if the economy holds) would be made up over three years with 
money due to be returned to taxpayers under TABOR.</p> 
<p>Coffman also proposes suspending the 1 percent annual funding increase to 
K-12 education required by Amendment 23. Other legislative leaders and Gov. 
Owens suggest relaxation of the requirements of both amendments for a set 
period of time.</p> 
<p>No doubt, other ideas will surface as the House sets to work on the problem 
this week.</p> 
<p>They have to: We need proposals on the ballot, we need to make a decision.
</p> 
<p>The storm is still brewing.</p>

<p><b>We may be our worst enemy</b></p> 
<p><b>By Richard Walter</b></p> 
<p><b>Staff Writer</b></p> 
<p>&quot;But now is Christ risen from the dead, and become the first fruits of 
them that slept.</p> 
<p>&quot;For since by man came death, by man also came the resurrection of the 
dead.</p> 
<p>&quot;For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made 
alive.&quot;</p> 
<p>- I Corinthians 15:20-22</p> 
<p>As Christendom prepares to celebrate the persecution and resurrection of 
the Son of God, Americans are again mired in the chaos of seeking a meaning in 
life.</p> 
<p>The Biblical message above should quickly supply that meaning.</p> 
<p>As the advocates of martyrdom pursue their eternal reward in promised 
physical pleasures, the Christian sees the ultimate as eternity with Christ and 
the Father.</p> 
<p>The doubting Thomases among the civilizations of the world invariably want 
to know how they can be sure, how they can trust the word of a man they never 
saw, how the story of Salvation born in death on a cross can possibly relate to 
their search for truth today.</p> 
<p>It is a matter of belief, trust and reliance. Believe the word which 
outlines the story of Jesus of Nazareth; trust the veracity of the translations 
and the changes which have been made through the years; rely on the sustenance 
of the Holy Spirit (again unseen) to carry you through.</p> 
<p>Taking a different approach, one might look to the cartoonist Walt Kelly 
who stunned the world with his 1970 Pogo strip in which Pogo acknowledged, 
&quot;We have met the enemy and he is us.&quot;</p> 
<p>While it was the line which started a comedic series of responses, we need 
look father back, to Kelly's 1953 &quot;The Pogo Papers&quot; for the original 
which read: &quot;We shall meet the enemy and not only may he be ours, he may 
be us.&quot;</p> 
<p>Who is the enemy of the people of America today?</p> 
<p>Is it the Saddam Husseins and Osama bin Ladens of the world? The terrorist 
hijacking an airplane to crash it into a structure which is the epitome of 
worship of money and stature? The foreign soldiers on the battlefields of the 
world who have no idea what the freedoms of America can offer?</p> 
<p>It is all those and, it is as Pogo said, ourselves.</p> 
<p>As Christ's death on the cross and his subsequent resurrection proved to 
the believers, we have within us the strengths to meet the challenges of 
untruth, the wavering spirit of modern doubters, and the fear of death from the 
unknown. </p> 
<p>In the First Epistle of John, Chapter 2, verses 1 and 2, we find the 
explanation:</p> 
<p>&quot;If any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the 
righteous.</p> 
<p>&quot;And he is the propitiation for our sins; and not for ours only, but 
also for the sins of the whole world.&quot;</p> 
<p>Tomorrow is Good Friday, the date marking the crucifixion, the raising of 
Christ onto the Cross.</p> 
<p>Perhaps, just perhaps, we can use it and the celebration of Christ's 
resurrection on Easter Sunday as bases for a resurrection of our own lives and 
those of the ones we see as enemies.</p> 
<p>Even if that enemy is in fact - US. </p>

<p>The town authorities should take the initiative in the rebuilding of the 
grandstand at the ball grounds. The heavy snows the past winter have made it a 
total wreck. So long as the ball boys contribute their time for the public's

outgrowing its quarters in the Town Hall and additional space will soon be 
necessary. The group met to discuss the possibility of joint action in 
construction of a new building.</p>

<p><b>Unitarians hold forums on alcohol abuse</b></p> 
<p><b>By Tess Noel Baker</b></p> 
<p><b>Staff Writer</b></p> 
<p>&quot;What does a six-pack cost?&quot;</p> 
<p>That was the question Archuleta County Court Judge Jim Denvir asked a group 
of about 20 at a Pagosah Unitarian Universalist Fellowship forum.</p> 
<p>The answer: $10,572.50. That's his estimate of the cost of a first-time 
offense for a driver found guilty of driving under the influence with no 
aggravating circumstances.</p> 
<p>All Denvir's figures were laid out on a one-page worksheet handed out to 
the group as part of the forum, one of four planned monthly through June to 
address local issues of alcohol abuse and rehabilitation in Archuleta County. 
It was a worksheet he asked members of the group to pass on to their friends 
and family. To pass on to those who might consider one night, after consuming a 
six-pack in three hours, whether or not to get behind the wheel of a car.</p> 
<p>A six-pack. In three hours. That was the basis for Denvir's example, 
&quot;Joe Driver.&quot; Driver weighed around 160 pounds and drank the six pack 
while watching football with his buddies. While driving home, he loses control 
of the car, drives off the road, and crashes through a fence. After a 
Breathalyzer test, he is ticketed for driving under the influence, driving with 
excessive alcohol content and careless driving.</p> 
<p>The first costs come from the tow truck, posting bail and the first court 
appearance for which he must take two hours off work. His job is construction 
and he earns $16 an hour.</p> 
<p>The attorney fees pile up, as do the hours he must take off work. Joe 
decides to take the case to a jury. The jury finds him guilty of DUI.</p> 
<p>Of course, Denvir said, those who can't afford to pay an attorney can be 
represented by a public defender. Still, the dollars and cents add up. And 
Denvir said, the estimate of six beers over three hours was fairly conservative.
</p> 
<p>According to the handout, &quot;if he had been drinking malt liquor or had 
three more beers, he'd be at .18 blood alcohol content. He would receive two 
nights in jail at that BAC and the accident.&quot;</p> 
<p>Sentencing at the lower BAC would include costs for the alcohol evaluation, 
restitution for the damage to the fence in the accident, time away from work 
for 48 hours of public service, the victim impact panel and alcohol education 
and therapy.</p> 
<p>As far as what part of that sentencing regimen works, Denvir said different 
things affect different people. It's also about timing, and has as much to do 
with what is going on in a person's life outside the courtroom as in it.</p> 
<p>The Victim Impact Panel is one option. This is a presentation done by the 
state patrol for those convicted of alcohol-related crimes and puts the 
offenders face-to-face with some of the victims of drinking and driving 
accidents. Sometimes, Denvir, said he will also require offenders to attend 
Alcoholics Anonymous meetings. Jail time is generally not given to first-time 
offenders, but is as the offenses worsen or multiply.</p> 
<p>According to studies, he said, the greatest impact a jail sentence has on 
recidivism, or the chance of a person repeating the offense, is on a first-time 
offender spending a couple night behind bars - perhaps for the first time in 
their lives. </p> 
<p>Others may be sentenced to receive random Breathalyzer testing, or 
Antabuse, a drug that makes people ill if they consume alcohol.</p> 
<p>Even with all the tools of sentencing, Denvir said, alcohol abuse is not a 
problem that can be addressed in court. Alcohol abuse is a societal problem.</p>
<p>&quot;Our children are growing up in a situation where drinking is a 
positive thing, in a situation where drinking to excess is a positive 
thing,&quot; he said. It is a situation where the advertising message is that 
drinking alcohol brings a person everything they might want in the way of fun 
and social acceptance.</p> 
<p>And what if the price is even higher? What if can't be paid off?</p> 
<p>That was the question Police Chief Don Volger addressed.</p> 
<p>What if the cost was a life? A father? Brother? Sister? Daughter? A 
teen-ager?</p> 
<p>Of the more than 40,000 deaths in motor vehicle accidents in 2000, over 
17,000 involved alcohol. During the Vietnam War, more lives were lost on the 
country's highways than in the war. Lots more. Deaths on the battlefield 
numbered 58,000. Deaths on the roads numbered 228,000.</p> 
<p>Volger said the drinking and driving deaths are devastatingly violent and 
equally unintentional.</p> 
<p>In Archuleta County, he added, about 18-20 percent of accidents involving 
injury also involve alcohol. About 1 percent of those involve a death.</p> 
<p>&quot;We have about one death a year in Archuleta County that involves 
drinking and driving,&quot; Volger said.</p> 
<p>Still, that's one too many.</p> 
<p>To try to address the problem, both county and town law enforcement 
participate in the Law Enforcement Assistance Fund program, a state grant 
program providing matching funds for overtime saturation patrols and DUI 
checkpoints. Both the sheriff's department and the Pagosa Springs police 
participate in this program, receiving about $27,000 for such patrols this year.
</p> 
<p>It's helped, Volger said.</p> 
<p>In 1981, when the LEAF program started, the number of motor vehicle deaths 
in Colorado was 756,425 of those were alcohol related. In 2002, the last year 
statistics were available, 742 died on Colorado roads in motor vehicle 
accidents, 249 of those involved alcohol.</p> 
<p>The question the Unitarians have posed is, &quot;Could the community do 
more?&quot;</p> 
<p>Ilene Haykus, program committee chair for the group, said as Unitarians, 
proactive community action is part of their faith. Addressing the issue of 
drinking and driving is simply their latest attempt to mobilize the community 
to address a social concern.</p> 
<p>Haykus said DUI arrests and convictions seem to have an all-too constant 
slot on the town's police blotter, a fact that drove the program committee to 
set up this series of forums as a first step toward addressing the issue as a 
community. Three forums remain.</p> 
<p>&quot;Once we have all the information we'll have had three or four months 
to digest it, and maybe by then we'll have the resources to implement 
something,&quot; she said, suggesting that a mentoring program brought up 
during the question and answer session March 29 might be a place to start. 
Alone, she added, the Unitarians do not have enough resources to adequately 
address the problem. As a community, we just might.</p> 
<p>The forums on alcohol abuse continue April 25, with speaker Alice Kelly who 
will address court-appointed rehabilitation programs. May 23, Ken Puhler, of 
Durango, will speak on resources for alcohol abuse prevention and education in 
the Durango area, and June 27, Mary Jo Rakowski, president of the Southwest 
Chapter of Mothers Against Drunk Driving, will take center stage to talk about 
the activities of that group. A question and answer period follows all speakers.
</p> 
<p>Presentations are given during the Unitarian's regular Sunday services at 
10:30 a.m. The universalists meet in Unit 15 of Greenbriar Plaza. Unit 15 is on 
the east side of the commercial plaza. Turn east on Greenbriar Drive off of 
North Pagosa, then left into the parking lot. Look for the fellowship's sign.

<p><b>We've forgotten what it is to be hungry</b></p>

<p><b>Staff Writer </b></p> 
<p>Travel is so easy these days, continent to continent in a few hours. </p> 
<p>Of course we all know it wasn't always so. Not so long ago, not much more 
than 125 years, about the time our great-grandparents were born, travel was an 
ordeal at best, even for a Baptist minister.</p> 
<p>The family of the Reverend Dan Bartholomew, a Baptist minister, came west 
from Minnesota about the year 1877.</p> 
<p>During late 1877 or early 1878, Pagosa Springs was birthed. But Pagosa 
Springs was not the destination for this family. They were bound for the Pine 
River area around Bayfield. Bayfield wasn't named until around 1900, but 
settlers homesteaded in the area during the mid- to late 1870s.</p> 
<p>According to a descendant, the chosen means of transportation for this 
family was a covered wagon pulled by ox team. We don't know if they had a red 
rooster and an old yeller dog, as the song goes. They did have many harrowing 
experiences along the way with Indians, drought, and the great grasshopper 
plague in Kansas and Nebraska. The railroad tracks were so covered with 
grasshoppers, the trains could not move. The cattle's tongues hung from their 
mouths for the lack of water. People starved and died during this plague; the 
land was stripped, not a leaf or blade of grass was left.</p> 
<p>One incident told as truth, not fiction, is that a starving family was fed 
by its cat which brought in a rabbit each day.</p> 
<p>One day while traveling they met a man walking. A little later, they met a 
woman walking. Then the man and woman started walking together. After about a 
week, you guessed it, the Rev. Dan performed a wedding ceremony for the couple. 
It was one of two weddings he performed while traveling west. Upon entering the 
San Juans, the family first went to Lake City, then on to the Pine River Valley.
</p> 
<p>An average day's travel was 10 or 15 miles. At that rate, it would have 
taken a week to go from Pagosa Springs to Durango.</p> 
<p>The family reached the vicinity of Bayfield and Ignacio after being on the 
road from Minnesota three or four months.</p> 
<p>Railroads had not yet reached this part of Colorado. Almost everything for 
their livelihood as well as the mail had to be brought across the mountains 
afoot or by horseback. </p> 
<p>Flour was $25 a hundred pounds and sugar $1 a pound. Meat and meat products 
were either raised or shot wild. For as long as three or four months at a time, 
there was nothing on the dinner table but potatoes and pork. Many times the 
family did not have enough to eat.</p> 
<p>The Bartholomews first took up land on Florida Mesa near the east end of 
Horse Gulch. Mr. Bartholomew helped T.C. Graden haul freight from Alamosa. 
Later, they homesteaded east of Pine River.</p> 
<p>Mrs. Dan Bartholomew (Minerva) was a fine seamstress, a lady tailor in her 
day. There were times they had only the clothes on their backs that she had 
made, sometimes from grain sacks. When they were able to get flour, she spent 
many nights baking bread and making clothing by candlelight.</p> 
<p>The Rev. Dan was the first minister of the gospel stationed in the Pine 
River Valley. He did not believe in delivering a sermon for a salary. His 
congregation paid in food, a sack of potatoes, a little pork, and a few 
vegetables. In the summer they picked chokecherries and berries from the 
mountainsides to make jams and jellies.</p> 
<p>There were many Indian scares after settling in the valley. One time the 
whites were preparing for war, boarding up their homes and making a stockade, 
as there was a rumor of Indian attack. They waited and waited and nothing 
happened. So they finally sent a white scout to talk to the chief and found out 
that the Indians were doing the same, expecting a white attack. The chief said, 
&quot;Indians do not attack, but the whites would.&quot;</p> 
<p>The story just told was written by Harriet Gladys Schiller Jackson, the 
granddaughter of the Rev. Dan. It may be found in &quot;Pioneers of the San 
Juan Country,&quot; Volume IV.</p>

<p><b>Wet weather expected to linger through weekend </b></p>

<p>Keep an umbrella handy.</p> 
<p>The recent chain of wet weather moving through Pagosa Country may continue 
into the weekend, according to the latest forecasts for the Four Corners region.
</p> 
<p>After an arid March that brought only trace levels of precipitation to 
southwest Colorado, area lawns and gardens are greening once more due to last 
week's steady schedule of afternoon showers.</p> 
<p>More of the same is on the way, says Brian Avery, a forecaster with the 
National Weather Service Office in Grand Junction.</p> 
<p>&quot;It looks like chances are pretty good for things to stay on the wet 
side through Saturday,&quot; said Avery.</p> 
<p>&quot;We're looking at scattered rain showers and thunderstorms during the 
day, with the possibility of snow flurries during the night,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>&quot;Low temperatures around 20 can be expected through Sunday night, then 
things should start to warm up and dry out by Monday,&quot; concluded Avery.</p>
<p>According to Avery, mostly-cloudy skies, scattered rain showers and 
isolated thunderstorms are expected today, especially during the afternoon 
hours.</p> 
<p>Highs are predicted in the 45-55 range; lows should dip into the upper 20s.
</p> 
<p>The forecasts for Friday through Sunday include a 30-percent chance for 
rain and snow showers, highs in the upper 40s and lows in the upper teens to 
low 20s.</p> 
<p>Monday calls for variable skies, highs near 50 and lows in the 20s.</p> 
<p>Mostly-sunny skies are expected for Tuesday and Wednesday, along with highs 
in the upper 50s and lows around 30.</p> 
<p>According to information obtained from The Weather Channel, the average 
high temperature recorded last week in Pagosa Springs was 40 degrees. The 
average low was 23. Moisture totals for the week were not available at press 
time.</p> 
<p>The Colorado Avalanche Information Center reports the current avalanche 
danger in the southern San Juan Mountains is &quot;low&quot; with pockets of 
&quot;moderate.&quot;</p> 
<p>The Pagosa Ranger District rates the current area fire danger as 
&quot;low.&quot; Conditions are subject to change rapidly this time of year; 
for updates, call the district office at 264-2268.</p> 
<p>According to the latest SNOTEL data, the snowpack level for the Upper San 
Juan River Basin is 91 percent of average.</p> 
<p>San Juan River flow south of town ranged from approximately 550 cubic feet 
per second to 720 cubic feet per second last week. The river's historic median 
flow for the week of April 1 equals roughly 290 cubic feet per second.</p>
