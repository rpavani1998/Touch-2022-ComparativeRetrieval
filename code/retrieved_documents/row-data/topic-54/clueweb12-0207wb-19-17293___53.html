<p><b>Health district's financial turnaround cited</b></p> 
<p><b>By Tess Noel Baker</b></p> 
<p><b>Staff Writer</b></p> 
<p>&quot;Remarkable,&quot; and &quot;superior&quot; were just two of the 
adjectives an auditor used Tuesday to describe the financial turnaround in the 
Upper San Juan Health Service District books.</p> 
<p>In just one year, Mike Branch, a certified public accountant, said the 
district went from an overall $434,771 loss to having revenues top expenses by 
$591,321 - a net turnaround of $1,026,092. Of that, $350,290 was a result of 
the mill levy increase passed in November of 2001. The rest was a result of 
better accounting, an increase in revenues, a decrease in expenses, and 
much-improved collection efforts, he said.</p> 
<p>Net operating revenue for the district increased by $165,000. Expenses 
dropped by $421,542, in part due to a decrease in bad debts from $220,508 to 
$50,459. The district's cash balance went from being overdrawn by $36,443 to 
$201,786 in the bank at the end of 2002.</p> 
<p>It's also the first year since Branch started auditing the books in the 
mid-1990s that the Dr. Mary Fisher Medical Center has shown a profit based 
solely on operations. In the past, he said, when the center showed revenues in 
excess of expenditures it was donations that pushed them over the top. </p> 
<p>From beginning to end, it's a much different report than he's made the last 
two years.</p> 
<p>&quot;This has been a pleasure,&quot; he said. &quot;I hate worse than 
anything to come in and call a board a bunch of swamp rabbits and tell them if 
they're not careful, the ship could run aground.&quot;</p> 
<p>Back in 2001, he reported the district had problems based on the 2000 
audit. A plan to cut expenditures by 10 percent and increase revenues by the 
same amount was put in place. However, the numbers never came through. In fact, 
expenses increased 24 percent.</p> 
<p>Then, in April of 2002, he told the board that based on the 2001 audit 
report they would have to cut $200,000 from the 2002 budget - $65,000 to break 
even and another $135,000 to pay overdue bills. They had eight months to do it.
</p> 
<p>&quot;The year 2001 actually turned out worse than I expected,&quot; he 
wrote in that report to the board. &quot;Total revenue was down almost $100,000 
from 2000 and expenditures were up $355,823. The district had expenses in 
excess of revenues of $434,771. Even with an increase of $371,719 in potential 
tax revenues this year, the district will not break even if operating results 
do not improve.&quot;</p> 
<p>By cutting back on salaries, leaving some positions unfilled, reducing 
equipment purchases and making a decision to stop paying employee dependent 
health care costs, the district managed to reach those goals and get &quot;back 
to black.&quot; Apparently, they did that and a lot more.</p> 
<p>&quot;The quality of the accounting for the district has improved 
significantly,&quot; said Branch. &quot;This district has gone from probably 
the governmental entity with the worst accounting to one of the best.&quot; He 
gave a lot of credit to the district for hiring a professional accountant to 
oversee the books rather than depending on part-time staff to get to the books 
when the other work was done.</p> 
<p>Board member Wayne Wilson and Chairman Charles Hawkins both thanked the 
clinic staff, the Emergency Medical Services staff and administrative staff for 
their hard work in making the changes necessary to turn the district around 
financially. </p> 
<p>&quot;It wasn't the board that did this, it was the efforts of everybody 
involved,&quot; Wilson said.</p>

<p><b>Lightning sparks 12 fires Tuesday</b></p> 
<p><b>By Tess Noel Baker</b></p> 
<p><b>Staff Writer</b></p> 
<p>It's easy to applaud recent rains, but accompanying lightning causes its 
own problems.</p> 
<p>Lightning strikes during Tuesday's afternoon thunderstorm caused at least 
12 separate fires sending members of the fire protection district and the 
forest service scrambling. </p> 
<p>Fire Chief Warren Grams said members of the Pagosa Fire Protection District 
responded to six separate lightning-caused fires Tuesday.</p> 
<p>&quot;We were running around like crazy,&quot; he said. They responded to 
fires in Timber Ridge, near North Lake, in Hidden Valley, on Reservoir Hill and 
on Park Avenue.</p> 
<p>Grams said the strike on Park Avenue hit a home, burning up the telephone, 
setting off smoke alarms and knocking out the electricity. Otherwise, the fires 
were held under an acre and were contained.</p> 
<p>Marty Adell, acting assistant fire management officer for the Pagosa Ranger 
District, said forest service fire crews responded to five lightning-caused 
fires in Cabezon Canyon and one in the Blanco Basin area Tuesday. Again, all 
fires were kept under an acre in size.</p> 
<p>&quot;The fire crews did an excellent job of getting to them and containing 
them,&quot; he said. Helicopters were used to fly some of the crews to the site 
of the blazes.</p> 
<p>Wednesday morning, crews were returning to the site of the fire in the 
Blanco Basin for final cleanup. The sites of the other fires were being 
rechecked to make sure any hot spots had been extinguished.</p>

<p><b>Recall sought for five on health board</b></p> 
<p><b>By Tess Noel Baker</b></p> 
<p><b>Staff Writer</b></p> 
<p>The petition effort to recall the five remaining elected members of the 
Upper San Juan Hospital District continues.</p> 
<p>On June 13, three days before the deadline, the group leading the drive 
turned in recall petitions for Wayne Wilson, Patty Tillerson, Sue Walan, Martha 
Garcia and Ken Morrison to the county clerk for certification.</p> 
<p>The progress made toward finding a solution to employee concerns and 
district morale problems simply hasn't been enough, fast enough, said Pam 
Ferrell, one of those involved in the drive.</p> 
<p>&quot;They've been looking at a solution for a long time, and they're still 
losing staff,&quot; she said. &quot;I think they're sugar-coating things. We 
felt that we really need a change. We want everything to move forward.&quot;</p>
<p>Each of the petitions submitted to the clerk was attached to 105 pages of 
signature forms with space for 15 signatures per page. Of course, she said, 
each of those pages didn't necessarily have 15 signatures, but, still, she 
added, there should be plenty to reach the 300-signature minimum needed to move 
forward with an election.</p> 
<p>Now, it's up to Archuleta County Clerk June Madrid to determine whether or 
not that's officially true. She has 10 days in which to certify the petitions 
one way or another. By Wednesday morning, she said, her staff was still working 
on the first two petitions and they had closed their doors to focus solely on 
the job.</p> 
<p>District board chairman Charles Hawkins said the board had no comment on 
the possibility of a recall election at this time. It's just too early to 
determine what, if anything, will need to be done.</p> 
<p>&quot;This board will follow the statute as it reads,&quot; he said. 
&quot;We're bound by the law and we're going to follow the law.&quot;</p> 
<p>If a recall election is necessary, Madrid said, it will be up to the 
district board to set the election date.</p> 
<p>Board directors took no action on the report.</p>

<p><b>Deadlines established for Fairfield settlement </b></p> 
<p><b>By Richard Walter</b></p> 
<p><b>Staff Writer</b></p> 
<p>A 20-year confrontation over assessment of annual fees for upkeep of 
recreational facilities has reached the &quot;Proposed Settlement 
Agreement&quot; phase in District Court of Archuleta County.</p> 
<p>At issue is the fee levied since 1983 by Fairfield Resorts Inc., and its 
predecessors, against certain property owners in 27 separate subdivisions which 
make up the bulk of the properties in what is commonly known as Pagosa Lakes.
</p> 
<p>A legal notice running elsewhere in this issue spells out which 
subdivisions are covered and gives a specific listing of actual deadlines for 
action.</p> 
<p>Since the proposed settlement results from a class action suit against the 
original Fairfield developers and all subsequent divisions thereof, property 
owners must decide whether they want to opt out of the proposed settlement or 
if they want to be a party to the action.</p> 
<p>Deadline for opting out, submitting fee disputes to a hearing officer and 
to comment on or object to the settlement agreement is July 24. The deadline 
for filing to enter an appearance in court is July 30. A settlement fairness 
hearing is scheduled Aug. 6.</p> 
<p>Under the proposed settlement:</p> 
<p>(1) Fairfield Resorts Inc., would agree, effective retroactively to Dec. 
31, 2002, to terminate its rights to collect the fee charged for upkeep of 
recreational amenities at the Pagosa Development from all members of the 
settlement class. </p> 
<p>(2) All current owners of property interests in the Pagosa Development who 
do not opt out of the settlement class would be required to pay all outstanding 
fees and other amounts assessed against their properties for periods prior to 
Dec. 31, 2002.</p> 
<p>(3) Fairfield Resorts would offer certain discounts to the current owners 
who, prior to Dec. 1, 2003, pay all amounts deemed owed to Fairfield Resorts.
</p> 
<p>(4) All claims that members of the settlement class may have against 
Fairfield Resorts relating to the fee, the supplemental declarations of 
restrictions, or the case will be fully and finally released, and the action 
will be dismissed with prejudice.</p> 
<p>(5) Fairfield Resorts would reserve its rights to pursue any and all claims 
for fees, interest, penalties, costs and attorneys' fees against those persons 
or entities who opt out of the settlement class; and</p> 
<p>(6) Those persons or entities who opt out of the settlement class will lose 
all benefits of the settlement agreement, and their properties will remain 
subject to the supplemental declarations of restrictions.</p> 
<p>Class members for purpose of the proposed settlement are any persons or 
entities that currently own or formerly owned an interest in a residential lot, 
townhouse, or condominium located within the Pagosa Development; and which lot, 
townhouse or condominium was (1) sold or otherwise conveyed by Fairfield 
Resorts after March 1, 1983 or (2) subject to the supplemental declaration of 
restrictions recorded with the County Clerk and Recorder of Archuleta County by 
Fairfield Resorts on Aug. 2, 1983.</p> 
<p>The suit was originally brought by Lorie Church individually and as 
representative of a class consisting of all owning interests in Pagosa 
Development properties sold by Fairfield after March 1, 1983.</p> 
<p>If you are a member of the settlement class so-described, you can support, 
object to or opt out of or participate in the proposed settlement.</p> 
<p>If you do not request exclusion, you may also enter an appearance through 
counsel. Further, failure to opt out of the settlement class in a timely manner 
may entitle you to certain benefits, subject you to certain obligations, or 
both.</p> 
<p>Any final judgment, whether favorable or not, will include all members of 
the settlement class who do not request exclusion.</p> 
<p>Fairfield Resorts Inc. filed the supplemental declaration of restrictions 
with the county clerk on Aug. 2, 1983 imposing obligations on lots in Pagosa 
Development remaining unsold at the time.</p> 
<p>Among other things, the document authorized Fairfield to assess the fee, 
charge interest on all past due fees at the highest rate allowed by law, and to 
recover attorneys' fees and costs of collection associated with any actions to 
collect such fees.</p> 
<p>In this case, the named plaintiffs, on behalf of themselves and members of 
the settlement class, have alleged Fairfield acted improperly in filing the 
declaration of restrictions and in assessing and collecting the fee.</p> 
<p>The Archuleta County District Court already has ruled on merits in four 
cases involving the same issues and found the named plaintiffs in those cases 
were required to pay the fee and ordered them to pay Fairfield over $500,000 in 
attorneys' fees associated with those cases.</p> 
<p>Fairfield, its representative say, is confident it would prevail in this 
case for the same reasons it was successful in the prior cases.</p> 
<p>Because these issues have been pending in the district court for over 10 
years, however, all parties have concluded it is desirable the suits be settled.
</p> 
<p>The settlement agreement does not apply to timeshare units; any lots 
conveyed to Archuleta County in 1992 and 1993 pursuant to Fairfield's 
reorganization for all debtors approved by U.S. Bankruptcy Court and later sold 
at auction by Archuleta County; Fairfield Resorts Inc., its subsidiaries and 
affiliates, and any corporations, trusts, or entities controlled by or 
affiliated with fairfield; or any person who opts out of the settlement class 
in a timely manner.</p>

<p><b>Scattered thunderstorms expected through weekend</b></p> 
<p><b>By Tom Carosello</b></p> 
<p><b>Staff Writer</b></p> 
<p>Higher elevations across Pagosa Country received sporadic, heavy rainfall 
during the past week while areas closer to town were relatively shortchanged by 
a continuing pattern of scattered afternoon thunderstorms.</p> 
<p>According to forecasters, that trend will continue through the weekend, 
although the latest batch of thunderstorms is expected to be dryer and shorter 
in duration than those of previous weeks.</p> 
<p>&quot;Unfortunately, there is a heightened degree of fire danger associated 
with the outbreak of thunderstorm activity in the area during the next few days 
due to the likelihood of dry lightning strikes,&quot; said Jim Daniels, a 
forecaster with the National Weather Service Office in Grand Junction.</p> 
<p>&quot;We're showing a trend toward a dryer, somewhat breezy southwest flow 
through Saturday and into Sunday, but weak disturbances and afternoon warming 
will spawn a few brief storms across the mountains,&quot; said Daniels.</p> 
<p>&quot;Otherwise, it looks as if the chance for rain will dissipate heading 
into next week,&quot; added Daniels. </p> 
<p>According to Daniels, increasing clouds throughout this morning and into 
this afternoon will result in the chance for an isolated thunderstorm before 
evening.</p> 
<p>High temperatures will range from 75 to 85, and lows should register in the 
40s.</p> 
<p>The same cloud pattern and a 20-percent chance for rain is included with 
Friday's forecast. Highs should peak in the low 80s, and lows should fall into 
the upper 30s.</p> 
<p>Saturday and Sunday call for partly-cloudy to mostly-cloudy skies and a 
minimal chance for afternoon thunderstorms. Highs should approach 80 while lows 
should dip into the 40s.</p> 
<p>The forecasts for Monday and Tuesday predict mostly-sunny skies, a 
negligible chance for rain, highs in the upper 70s to mid-80s and lows in the 
40s.</p> 
<p>Wednesday's forecast includes a 20-percent chance for afternoon 
thunderstorms across higher elevations. Highs should hover around 80; lows 
should settle into the mid-40s. </p> 
<p>The average high temperature recorded last week at Stevens Field was 79 
degrees. The week's average low was 37. Precipitation measured at Stevens Field 
amounted to approximately one-tenth of an inch.</p> 
<p>The Pagosa Ranger District rates the current area fire danger as 
&quot;high.&quot; Conditions are subject to change rapidly this time of year; 
for updates, call the district office at 264-2268.</p> 
<p>The National Allergy Bureau rates area pollen counts as &quot;low to 
moderate&quot; and lists oak and grass as the current dominant pollens.</p> 
<p>San Juan River flow ranged between approximately 360-680 cubic feet per 
second last week. The river's historic median flow for the week of June 19 is 
roughly 1,300 cubic feet per second.</p>

<p><b>20th annual Blowout Softball Tournament Aug. 2-3</b></p> 
<p><b>By Richard Walter</b></p> 
<p><b>Staff Writer</b></p> 
<p>The 20th annual Blowout Softball Tournament will be played Aug. 2 and 3 at 
the sports complex adjacent to Golden Peaks Stadium.</p> 
<p>Traditionally, the tournament draws up to 30 teams from all across the 
Southwest.</p> 
<p>And, also traditionally, the proceeds go to improve some aspect of the high 
school sports program in the community.</p> 
<p>This year, the funds will be used for a new net backstop for the baseball 
field reaching much higher and with an overhang to prevent fouls going back 
into other playing areas. </p> 
<p>That project will be in addition to remodeling of the baseball field press 
box with a glassed observation area for both voice and print media.</p> 
<p>In the past, the tournament has provided wrestling equipment, including 
portable timers and mats, and various equipment for other athletic endeavors.
</p> 
<p>To qualify for entry in the men's open, the fee is $225 and two blue dot 
balls; in women's open, the fee's the same, with two green dot balls.</p> 
<p>A $100 deposit is required and it guarantees placement in the respective 
tournament bracket.</p> 
<p>Registration deadline is Tuesday, July 29.</p> 
<p>All entries should be mailed to Sue Jones Softball Tournament, PO Box 1075, 
Pagosa Springs, CO 81147. </p> 
<p>For more information, call Jones at 264-2642 or on cell at 970-946-1439.</p>
<p>Certified umpires will be provided for all games in both male and female 
brackets.</p> 
<p>And, Jones hopes, this will not be a repeat of the 2002 mud bowl which 
resulted after the first measurable rains in weeks.</p>

<p><b>Mountain Express gets upgrade, may expand service to Saturdays</b></p> 
<p><b>By Tom Carosello</b></p> 
<p><b>Staff Writer</b></p> 
<p>Honoring a request from Dave Sedgwick, county transportation director, 
Archuleta County commissioners voted Tuesday to approve the purchase of a new 
bus to upgrade the Mountain Express public transit service.</p> 
<p>The new vehicle, to be purchased from a Colorado Springs-based bus sales 
company known as Startrans, will replace an older bus currently used in the 
county fleet and should be ready for delivery in 60-90 days.</p> 
<p>&quot;It is a longer, larger vehicle,&quot; said Sedgwick, indicating the 
purchase will raise the current seating capacity from 14 to 18 and improve 
drivers' range of vision and passenger safety measures.</p> 
<p>While the county will pay approximately $47,000 for the bus up front, 
Sedgwick indicated those funds &quot;will be reimbursed the same day&quot; 
under provisions of the federal Job Access Reverse Commute Grant program.</p> 
<p>Funds from the program, which are also known as JARC grants, are primarily 
aimed at improving a community's ability to provide residents with 
transportation to and from job sites.</p> 
<p>&quot;We're trying to get the workforce moving,&quot; said Sedgwick, adding 
that roughly 50 percent of those who use Mountain Express are exclusively 
riding back and forth between home and work.</p> 
<p>Sedgwick also informed the board of the rising need for Mountain Express to 
add Saturday service to its schedule, and while they took no action on the 
proposal, the commissioners voiced &quot;conceptual agreement.&quot;</p> 
<p>&quot;I agree that it's necessary,&quot; said Commissioner Mamie Lynch, 
&quot;It's just that our ducks are not in a row, and I like ducks in a 
row.&quot;</p> 
<p>The main reason for a delay on any decision to expand service relates to 
budgetary concerns.</p> 
<p>According to Sedgwick, a minor budget amendment to the tune of roughly 
$4,400 would be required if the board decides to adopt the suggestion to 
implement the weekend service from Aug. 2 through the end of the year.</p> 
<p>If approved, Sedgwick said the extended service will definitely fill a void 
and could be evaluated on a regular basis and adjusted (or eliminated) 
accordingly.</p> 
<p>&quot;I feel it's a feather in the county's cap,&quot; concluded Sedgwick. 
</p> 
<p>In other business the board:</p> 
<p>- accepted Lynn Constan's resignation from the Upper San Juan Regional 
Planning Commission, effective July 1 (Constan is leaving the commission to 
assume a director's position within her church)</p> 
<p>- approved a request from Bill Steele, county administrator, to file for a 
30-day (deadline) extension with the state auditor's office for completion of 
the 2002 county audit</p> 
<p>- approved licensing for the Upper San Juan Health Service District to 
provide ambulance service, contingent upon compliance certification letters 
being signed by the district manager and an inspector's signature on 
corresponding, appropriate forms</p> 
<p>- gave final approval to phase I improvements for A-Affordable Mini-storage 
and approved release of the corresponding letter of credit</p> 
<p>-&nbsp;adopted a resolution allowing an easement that begins at County Road 
335 and serves the Rio Blanco Valley re-subdivision of Unit II to be named 
&quot;Jones Bend Court&quot;</p> 
<p>- granted a request from the planning department to accept an improvements 
agreement and escrow account funding for San Juan Veterinary Services' 
conditional use permit</p> 
<p>- approved various social services contracts which allow for the 
continuation of child care, family counseling, transportation and employment 
service efforts.</p>

<p><b>Grad student aims to fill county's agricultural history gaps</b></p> 
<p><b>By Tom Carosello</b></p> 
<p><b>Staff Writer </b></p> 
<p>If you're a native or longtime resident of Pagosa Country, don't be 
surprised if you get a knock on the door or a phone call this summer from a 
young man identifying himself as Sean Pummill.</p> 
<p>Pummill, a graduate student pursuing a master's degree in geography at the 
University of Montana, has chosen Archuleta County as the subject for his 
required thesis and, in the coming months, will be requesting interviews with 
anyone who can offer information on the county's &quot;good ol' days.&quot;</p> 
<p>Appearing before the county commissioners Tuesday morning to seek 
assistance and explain his intent, Pummill supplied the board with a letter 
outlining the scope of his plans to augment the area's historical data.</p> 
<p>&quot;I examine the relationships between humans and the natural 
environment in an attempt to better understand the reasons and patterns 
associated (with) our existence,&quot; read Pummill's letter to the board, 
&quot;In short, I study what places are like.&quot;</p> 
<p>Pummill, who refers to himself as a &quot;historical and regional 
geographer,&quot; told the board his interest is in the agricultural landscape 
of the county, specifically &quot;the changing role of agriculture&quot; from 
the late 1800s to present.</p> 
<p>Pummill then informed the board that he became enamored with the area after 
spending a short vacation hiking the backcountry near Fourmile Creek and 
visiting with local business owners.</p> 
<p>Pummill explained in order to complete his study, he will need to obtain a 
multitude of maps and other information sources from the county planning 
department, and requested a waiver for the fees associated with the use of such 
documents.</p> 
<p>Pummill told the board he felt his effort will benefit the county because 
he will be &quot;capturing the history of this place from a unique standpoint 
... offering little snapshots from the past.&quot;</p> 
<p>Marcus Baker, associate county planner, echoed those sentiments, telling 
the board, &quot;We have a gap in historical data I think his study can help 
fill. I think whatever he does is going to be a benefit in some way.&quot;</p> 
<p>Although the amount of time the planning department can set aside to assist 
Pummill is limited, said Baker, the end result will likely prove worthwhile for 
both parties.</p> 
<p>&quot;If we hired a consultant to perform a similar study, I don't think 
it's a stretch to say the cost would run into the thousands or even tens of 
thousands of dollars,&quot; said Baker. &quot;This way, both sides get 
something out of the deal for a reasonable exchange.&quot;</p> 
<p>The board reached a consensus in support of Pummill's request a short time 
later, and unanimously carried a motion to waive the corresponding research 
fees.</p> 
<p>Alden Ecker, board chairman, summarized the commissioners' support by 
stating, &quot;I think we should always do our best to put the (historical) 
bits and pieces together for the benefit of the county.&quot;</p> 
<p>After thanking the board for its cooperation, Pummill said he will return 
to the county in August to initiate his study and will provide the board with a 
copy of his thesis upon its completion.</p>

<p><b>Bats struck out during rec center construction</b></p> 
<p><b>By Richard Walter</b></p> 
<p><b>Staff Writer</b></p> 
<p>You've all heard the term &quot;bats in his belfry.&quot;</p> 
<p>It tends to indicate a bit of lunacy. </p> 
<p>The Ralph Eaton Recreation Center at Pagosa Lakes is undergoing 
refurbishing and expansion and it has been known for some time to have a bat 
problem.</p> 
<p>Workmen involved in the remodeling found the reason.</p> 
<p>As they worked on reroofing portions of the structure, they found a covey 
of 40-50 bats huddled in a rotting piece of subroofing.</p> 
<p>The intruders were evacuated and the area sealed to prevent reentry.</p> 
<p>Workers also found roof venting with no screening, another apparent point 
of entry for the nighttime marauders. Those, too, were corrected.</p> 
<p>Now, said Walt Lukasik, general manager, &quot;We think we have 95 percent 
of the bat problem struck out.&quot;</p> 
<p>As for the modernization project itself, he told the board of directors 
June 12, everything is on schedule though there have been some unexpected 
glitches.</p> 
<p>Roofing is 90 percent complete, the new front entry has been framed, stone 
work is done and stucco application is nearly ready to start, new shower 
installation has been completed, a 4x4 foot vent has been added at the back of 
the structure to aid in circulation of interior air, a nursery wall has been 
removed and replaced with a half wall and new walls are up in the redesigned 
interior.</p> 
<p>Lukasik told the board several work order changes have been initiated as 
crews find new problems.</p> 
<p>Included was replacement of front porch supports when it was found there 
were no footings or caissons under the original construction; replacement of 
the front concrete slab which had no frost barriers or drainage system and had 
settled four inches from level; and restructuring a ground drain so that it 
went to ground 25 feet from the building and drained into a wetland rather than 
falling directly at the base of the structure.</p> 
<p>Center director Ming Steen and her center team, he said, have done a 
tremendous job of keeping the center open during all the construction work.</p> 
<p>But, he added, the center will have to be closed temporarily when the epoxy 
flooring is poured in locker rooms because fumes will be very strong and the 
building will have to be thoroughly vented during that period.</p>

<p><b>Postal Service eliminating cluster box supply service </b></p> 
<p><b>By Richard Walter</b></p> 
<p><b>Staff Writer</b></p> 
<p>The U.S. Postal Service will no longer provide, install and maintain 
cluster box units for newly developing rural areas.</p> 
<p>It will, however, continue deliveries to existing cluster boxes and will 
deliver to new clusters that are properly installed and maintained by the 
residents of the area.</p> 
<p>That message was delivered June 12 to the board of directors of Pagosa 
Lakes Property Owners Association by Walt Lukasik, general manager.</p> 
<p>He said the notice of change had been received earlier in the week.</p> 
<p>Such units, he said, generally cost between $1,100 and $1,250 plus $200 for 
site preparation and pedestal.</p> 
<p>Once a cluster is properly installed, it is the property of the owners in 
the area but the postal service retains keys and accessibility rights.</p> 
<p>&quot;I don't see how we could pay for them,&quot; said director Fred 
Ebeling.</p> 
<p>&quot;It's a moot point, anyway,&quot; said director Tom Cruse, board 
president, &quot;until we get property owners coming in and talking about 
it.&quot;</p> 
<p>In other action the board:</p> 
<p>- joined Cruse in expressing condolences to the family of Brian Kirsop who 
drowned in a recent accident on Lake Forest</p> 
<p>- learned there is a problem with fish (crappie) in Lake Forest but not one 
involving disease. &quot;A study shows they are stressed but not 
diseased,&quot; said Lukasik and the problem is under study</p> 
<p>- learned the noxious weed spraying program apparently is have desired 
effects and is to be continued. The number is nowhere near as serious as last 
year, directors were told</p> 
<p>- reappointed Pierre Mion to the environmental control committee and voted 
to continue advertising for additional members</p> 
<p>- announced foreclosure on a lot in Highlands and agreed to have it listed 
at $6,000</p> 
<p>- agreed to postpone the regularly scheduled July 10 meeting in deference 
to the annual meeting July 26 - unless an emergency situation arises</p> 
<p>- learned the Long Range Planning Committee has completed its study of 
water needs and supply prospects and will have a report ready next month</p> 
<p>- received a statistical report on the sheriff's department animal control 
patrol for May showing 4,885 minutes of patrol time, 1,599 miles driven, nine 
reports taken, seven dogs impounded, two cats impounded, five cruelty to animal 
cases, 11 verbal warnings issued, three written warnings given and two summons

<p><b>Lake Forest residents will be polled on fund use ideas</b></p> 
<p><b>By Richard Walter</b></p> 
<p><b>Staff Writer</b></p> 
<p>The issue of errors in the original survey of the Lake Forest area of 
Pagosa Lakes is nowhere near as bad as it may have seemed.</p> 
<p>In fact, the Pagosa Lakes Property Owners Association has concluded that if 
one owner objects to a resurvey, none of the subdivision can be done.</p> 
<p>Director Tom Cruse, board president, asked if there are any serious 
discrepancies in the subdivision. </p> 
<p>Walt Lukasik, general manager, said six lots are basically involved and the 
greatest error is 35 feet in the owner's favor. All the rest are measured in 
distances from a few inches to four feet.</p> 
<p>Director Fred Ebeling said, &quot;We can survey, but we can't replat. The 
remaining money in the Fairfield settlement can be used for the property 
owners.&quot;</p> 
<p>Director David Bohl said there is currently $153,660 available in the fund 
and moved that Lukasik be directed by the board to poll property owners to get 
a consensus of opinion on how that money would best be used.</p> 
<p>&quot;I'm am an owner there,&quot; said Bohl, &quot;and personally, I'd 
like to see those funds used to complete the roads there.&quot;</p> 
<p>Director Pat Payne suggested the poll should include several possible uses. 
&quot;If we don't do that,&quot; she said, &quot;we'll get a myriad of 
opinions.&quot;</p> 
<p>Bohl said he is sure other residents will have other ideas, like possibly 
fire control measures.</p> 
<p>Hugh Bundy, the newest director, asked if the board would be bound by the 
poll and was told, &quot;No, it will just be advisory.&quot;</p> 
<p>Lukasik said the poll will be done but &quot;it will take some time.&quot;

<p><b>Plan to restructure clinic practice goes to health district board</b></p>
<p><b>By Tess Noel Baker</b></p> 
<p><b>Staff Writer</b></p> 
<p>Twenty years ago, the hospital district was formed to provide quality 
health care availability and stability to the local community, Dr. Mark 
Wienpahl told the Upper San Juan Health Service District board. Now, in order 
to continue that mandate, it's time for a change.</p> 
<p>Wienpahl, along with community member J.R. Ford and providers Dr. Bob Brown 
and nurse practitioner Susan Kuhns, presented the board a proposal Tuesday to 
privatize their medical practice, giving the community two private medical 
practices with close, collaborative ties to each other.</p> 
<p>&quot;We feel that this would give the community the most fiscally 
responsible approach,&quot; Wienpahl said.</p> 
<p>According to the five-page proposal, the new private clinic would be called 
Pagosa Health and Wellness. Hours would be Monday through Saturday from 9 
a.m.-6 p.m.</p> 
<p>During the hours the clinic is closed, staff would be on call for emergency 
care. They would also like to take on oversight and management of the urgent 
care facility.</p> 
<p>According to the proposal, &quot;Urgent care can be most efficiently and 
effectively managed by Pagosa Health and Wellness due to the designed proximity 
of facilities and the depth of service overlay between the family practice 
clinic and urgent care.&quot;</p> 
<p>They also propose managing current and future diagnostic equipment to allow 
physicians at both family practice clinics to use the equipment and bill for 
its use, thereby reducing competition among the two.</p> 
<p>Pagosa Health and Wellness would continue to operate out of the Dr. Mary 
Fisher Medical Center building on South Pagosa Boulevard. The proposal suggests 
starting with a five-year lease at a rate of $6,000 per month - discounted to 
$5,000 per month for the first six months.</p> 
<p>Should the practice outgrow the clinic building, or the building be needed 
for other health care operations, the proposal asks the district to give the 
private clinic a nine-month notice and agree to enter into a land-lease for 
adjacent property to keep the goal of a &quot;medical campus,&quot; in that 
area intact.</p> 
<p>The agreement also addresses continuous call coverage. Physicians at the 
newly-formed Pagosa Health and Wellness would agree to be on call three nights 
per week and three weekends per month. The remaining weekend and weeknights 
would be covered under a separate agreement with other physicians. The district 
would then reimburse on-call physicians at a rate of $250 per weekday/night or 
$500 per weekend day or night.</p> 
<p>Wienpahl said if the board approved the proposal it would take a minimum 60 
days to make the transition providing all contracts could be agreed upon.</p> 
<p>District board chairman Charles Hawkins thanked Ford and the providers for 
their hard work putting the proposal together. He invited the group to meet 
with the district's budget and finance committee and the district's attorney 
over the next couple weeks.</p> 
<p>At the same time, a consultant, Bob Bohlmann, recently hired by the 
district, will take a look at the plans being presented to the board, consider 
the organizational structure and mission of the district and present a report 
&quot;of opinions and strategic recommendations oriented to the achievement of 
optimum results given the realities of economic and legal limitations,&quot; 
according to his consulting contract.</p> 
<p>Hawkins said Bohlmann's work is expected to be finished shortly after July 
7 at which time a special meeting will be scheduled to make a decision on the 
future of the Dr. Mary Fisher Medical Center and its staff.</p>

<p><b>Fire danger increasing but</b></p> 
<p><b>not as serious as last year </b></p> 
<p>Public lands managers say fire danger is on the increase as temperatures 
continue to climb, rain continues to elude the area, and afternoon winds dry 
out the vegetation. </p> 
<p>However, due to the spring green-up that occurred, the conditions are 
different from last year, said Ron Klatt, fire management officer for the 
Columbine Public Lands Office.</p> 
<p>&quot;In 2002, there was very little green-up and a fire could, and did, 
start most anywhere. This year, with the good green-up, fires haven't spread as 
quickly and have been much easier to control,&quot; said Klatt. &quot;But there 
are patches of very dry vegetation where we are seeing quick and intense 
flare-ups.&quot; </p> 
<p>These flare-ups are occurring in what fire managers call the 1,000-hour 
fuels, or heavy fuels. These fuels, which are the 3-8 inch diameter branches 
and logs in the forest, haven't yet recovered from four years of drought.</p> 
<p>The moisture content in these logs are about 12 percent in the ponderosa 
pine forests and 5 percent in the pinon-juniper forests, both considered 
critical thresholds for fire intensity.</p> 
<p>Fuel moistures of both live and dead vegetation are gathered once a week 
from seven designated sites on public lands in southwest Colorado that reflect 
different types of vegetation at different elevations. The results are used to 
determine fire danger. The information can also help officials keep 
firefighters out of dangerous situations because, when fuel moisture levels are 
very low, wildfires can act in an unpredictable, erratic manner.</p> 
<p>Live fuel-moisture levels are derived by testing green leaves, needles and 
grass. The results help to determine how easily a fire would spread and how 
intensely it might burn.</p> 
<p>The moisture levels of grass, pine needles and oak leaves are measured 
using a moisture analyzer, which records the initial weight, cooks the 
materials, and re-measures the oven-dried weight. Moisture percentages are 
calculated by taking the difference between the two. The information is then 
entered into a database so conditions can be compared to previous years. </p> 
<p>The average current moisture content of perennial grasses and Gambel oak is 
about normal for this time of year. Ponderosa pine needles, however, are 
extremely low in moisture content and would be considered at a critical 
threshold for tree torching and crown-fire initiation.</p> 
<p>High moisture content in live vegetation would suppress a fire's ability to 
grow; low moisture content would make a fire grow faster. &quot;The lower the 
moisture, the faster the vegetation absorbs heat,&quot; said Klatt.</p> 
<p>While the moisture content of live fuels acts as either a fire retardant or 
stimulator, moisture levels of dead fuels - such as grass, sticks, branches and 
logs - determine the conditions under which a fire would start.</p> 
<p>Dead fuel-moisture levels are monitored in our area by nine Remote Auto 
Weather System Stations, which automatically compute the moisture levels of dry 
sticks. This data reflects the amount of time differently sized dead materials 
need to reflect surrounding environmental conditions.</p> 
<p>In addition, actual measurements are taken by hand in many locations to 
verify the calculated values. </p> 
<p>Other environmental factors, including wind, temperature and relative 
humidity, are monitored on an ongoing basis. These factors, in combination with 
the fuel moistures, provide managers with indices that project how likely a 
fire is to start and how fast it might burn, and helps them determine fire 
danger and the possible need for fire restrictions.</p> 
<p>This summer, federal fire managers will be sharing these indices with fire 
chiefs and state and county officials on a weekly basis.</p> 
<p>There is also a subjective side to assessing fire danger and the need for 
fire restrictions. &quot;We're reluctant to impose fire restrictions when the 
occurrence of human-caused fires is minimal,&quot; said Mark Lauer, fire 
management officer for the San Juan Public Lands in Durango. &quot;This year 
only six out of 65 fires have been human caused. At this time last year, 29 of 
the 42 fires were caused by humans.&quot;</p> 
<p>The Interagency Fire Dispatch Center has ensured quick response to fires in 
the five-county area, with positioning of the Type I airtanker, helicopters, 
the Colorado State Forest Service single-engine airtanker stationed in Cortez, 
and crews.</p> 
<p>First and foremost, land managers must consider public and firefighter 
safety. And when the indices are showing the potential for very high to extreme 
fire danger, managers must often impose restrictions regardless of the lack of 
human-caused fires.</p> 
<p>&quot;Fire restrictions will go into effect on lower elevations of the San 
Juan Public Lands the week of June 23 if southwest Colorado does not see some 
significant moisture before then,&quot; said Lauer.</p>

<p><b>Good fishing abounds in Pagosa Country </b></p> 
<p><b>By Tom Carosello</b></p> 
<p><b>Staff Writer </b></p> 
<p>A few area streams and rivers have reached maximum clarity as a result of 
subsiding runoff, but optimal fishing conditions and prime water clarity are 
still a few days away for most.</p> 
<p>Nevertheless, all Pagosa Country tributaries are currently fishable and 
steadily yielding a variety of colorful species to anglers in search of feisty, 
high-country trout. </p> 
<p>High-country reservoirs are benefitting from occasional afternoon 
thunderstorms and continue to fish well. Warm-water species are active 
throughout the day, while trout are seeking cooler/deeper water midday and 
stalking the shallows in the early morning hours and late afternoon.</p> 
<p>The following is a breakdown of conditions at some regional fishing 
hotspots:</p> 
<p>- Echo Lake - Lake continues to warm and largemouth bass, crappie, sunfish 
and perch are being taken regularly on live bait, ultralight jigs and small 
plastics. Trout are hitting flies, marabou jigs, spinners in gold and silver, 
fluorescent Z-Rays, salmon eggs, nightcrawlers and PowerBait.</p> 
<p>- Williams Creek Reservoir - Fishing for rainbow, cutthroat and brook trout 
is good in the early morning and late afternoon with live bait, light jigs in 
orange and yellow, and spinners in gold, silver and bright fluorescents. 
Kokanee salmon are holding deep, but some anglers are reporting occasional 
success near the inlet with flashy spoons and pop gear.</p> 
<p>- Navajo Reservoir - Water level and temperature are slowly rising and 
catfish are regularly being caught day and night on blood/stink baits near the 
river inlets and in the shallows. Smallmouth bass are hitting Yamamoto grubs 
and similar soft plastics, and crappie are being caught near rocky outcroppings 
and underwater brush using vertical jigging methods. Northern pike are 
reportedly most active in the afternoon and are hitting reflective spoons and 
plugs.</p> 
<p>- Piedra River - Clear water above the confluence with Williams Creek 
(unless affected by afternoon thunderstorms), but still a bit off color in the 
lower reaches. Browns and rainbows are the predominant catch and are hitting 
flies, streamers and flashy spinners.</p> 
<p>- Middle Fork, Piedra River - Running clear and cold. Small browns and 
rainbows are being taken on flies and small jigs and spinners in the side 
eddies and plunge pools. </p> 
<p>- Fourmile Creek - Flow is swift, clear and cold. Brook trout, cutthroat 
and a few rainbows and browns are hitting attractor-pattern flies and 
lightweight spinners.</p> 
<p>- Williams Creek - Fishing well along the entire stretch of creek and 
clarity has improved considerably in the past few days. Flies and small 
spinners are working well for brookies, cutthroats, browns and rainbows near 
the dam, while mainly browns and rainbows are being taken near the lower 
campgrounds.</p> 
<p>- San Juan River (through town) - River continues to fall and is nearly 
clear. Anglers using spinners, flies, marabou jigs and streamers are reporting 
good catches of rainbows along with a few browns. River will be stocked next 
week.</p>

<p><b>School board election coming; details listed</b></p> 
<p><b>By Richard Walter</b></p> 
<p><b>Staff Writer</b></p> 
<p>The time is drawing near for prospective candidates to signal their intent 
to run for the board of education of Archuleta School District 50 Joint.</p> 
<p>A school board election will take place in conjunction with the general 
election, by mail, on Nov. 4. </p> 
<p>Two board seats will be on the election block, the representatives for 
District 2 and District 3.</p> 
<p>Currently holding the District 2 seat is Mike Haynes who was appointed to 
replace Russel Lee who resigned and moved from the district.</p> 
<p>Haynes has indicated he will run for a full term in the seat.</p> 
<p>Holding the District 3 seat is Randall Davis, current board president and a 
veteran of 27 years on the board. He is ineligible to run for re-election under 
recent term limit legislation in Colorado.</p> 
<p>Candidates wishing to seek a school board seat must have lived in their 
district for 12 consecutive months before the election and be a registered 
elector themselves. </p> 
<p>A person is not eligible to run for school director if he or she has been 
convicted of committing a sexual offense against a child.</p> 
<p>Any person intending to run must file a written Notice of Intention to be a 
candidate and a nomination petition in accordance with the law.</p> 
<p>Petitions may be circulated only between Aug. 6 and Aug. 29 and require 50 
signatures. Only those signatures of registered voters, registered at least 30 
days before the election, will be considered valid and they may be obtained 
at-large, throughout the district.</p> 
<p>Petitions are to be submitted to the Archuleta County Clerk and Recorder's 
office, as designated election official, no later than 4 p.m. Aug. 29.</p> 
<p>Necessary forms will be available in the clerk's office at 449 San Juan St. 
in the Archuleta County Courthouse, after July 10, and are to be returned there.
</p> 
<p>Superintendent Duane Noggle told the board of education June 10 that he was 
&quot;well pleased&quot; with the way June Madrid, county clerk, &quot;ran the 
election process last year. </p> 
<p>&quot;She and her staff did a great job,&quot; he said, &quot;and I expect 
the same to be true this year.&quot;</p>

<p><b>Internet problems interrupt school district operations</b></p> 
<p><b>By Richard Walter</b></p> 
<p><b>Staff Writer</b></p> 
<p>From June 3 through June 10, service provided to Pagosa Springs schools 
through a regional provider was unavailable to staff.</p> 
<p>This lack of service proved to be disruptive to school administrative 
operations. Several important software applications used by the district are 
Web-based, which made it impossible to perform many of the common functions of 
district operations.</p> 
<p>In addition, interested individuals were unable to connect to the district 
Web site at www. pagosa. k12.co.us and employees on summer break were unable to 
log on to their e-mail from remote locations.</p> 
<p>The lack of service was a frustration to both employees of the district and 
other interested parties. </p> 
<p>Apparently for reasons unknown at this time, the T1 line from Durango to 
Pagosa Springs was disconnected, thereby cutting off services to the school 
district.</p> 
<p>To receive Internet service requires a coordinated effort of several 
different entities including the Internet provider, the telephone company and 
other communications firms.</p> 
<p>It is the district's understanding that the provider, Frontier Internet, 
was in the process of upgrading its connections and Qwest was reconfiguring the 
T-1 which serves Pagosa Springs .</p> 
<p>Internet service was restored to the district at 4:50 p.m. June 10 through 
a coordinated effort of CenturyTel, Frontier Internet and district employees.
</p> 
<p>The district expressed its appreciation to John Kennedy, David Feazel and 
Hanna Bachtel for taking time out of their summer vacations to help resolve the 
problem, and gave special thanks to Bill Donner of CenturyTel for working so 
hard to resolve the problem.</p> 
<p>If you have any question regarding the recent problem and are concerned 
transmissions were not received, call the district administration office at 
264-2228.</p>

<p><b>Clinic disservice</b></p> 
<p>Dear Editor:</p> 
<p>Talk of this town's need for better health care services deserves our 
attention.</p> 
<p>We all wish the Dr. Mary Fisher Clinic a balanced and sustainable 
resolution to their recent woes. However, when the Pagosa Springs Family 
Medicine Clinic is included in discussions of the town's health care 
inadequacies, I believe the town's residents and visitors are done a disservice.
</p> 
<p>My wife and I moved our family here from a major urban center to which 
people from around the globe travel for world class health care. One of our 
selection criteria for choosing a new community was health care that was 
competent and personal. We just recently had a second child and feel that the 
care available right here in our friendly Pagosa Springs is on a par with that 
of the area we moved from. While the birth was at Mercy in Durango we chose PS 
Family Medicine for pediatric care with the confidence gained by our previous 
experiences there.</p> 
<p>Certainly if treating larger health concerns, Pagosa Springs is the wrong 
place. But to suggest that this town needs a family practice physician with 
&quot;up-to-date training&quot; offends me and I believe many of the happy, 
well served patients of the Pagosa Springs Family Medicine Clinic. Already 
practicing there, are two dedicated physicians one currently Board Certified 
and the other formerly Board Certified in Family Medicine. Advanced Cardiac and 
Trauma Life Support are other areas of training and service they provide our 
community. It bears stating that these services are provided with no cost to 
the tax rolls of Pagosa Springs.</p> 
<p>These are challenging times for the medical community of Pagosa Springs. 
Let's start by seeing things the way they are. We are small town and like it or 
not this is the wrong place to live if your health concerns will likely 
necessitate regular and or urgent advanced care. If you live here, you have 
made that choice. Let's give credit and appreciation to the dedicated and 
professional health care providers already serving our community. They deserve 
our respect, for they certainly could be elsewhere making more money. Perhaps 
respect for our health care providers will result in even better and broader 
health care.</p>

<p><b>Prime need</b></p> 
<p>Dear Editor:</p> 
<p>In response to Patty Tillerson's letter in the SUN June 5, I wish to reply 
that option 3 may be the closest to a need for our community.</p> 
<p>That option is an urgent care center open weekends to both local and 
tourist walk-in emergencies, and ambulance service with doctor available after 
hours.</p> 
<p>This seems to be the issue that was asked for by the community and there is 
still a need.</p> 
<p>I appreciate your letter to the editor and hope people will respond to what 
their needs are.</p> 
<p>As far as needing to be specific with health care for locals and tourists, 
I think, especially with emergency health care, it should be extended to 
everyone. As a nurse, I don't think I would ask a person hurt on the street if 
he or she is a local or a tourist. And, as far as urgent care needing its own 
ambulance, I do not believe that is necessary.</p> 
<p>We are a small community. On that note, volunteers are hard to come by, no 
matter where one lives.</p> 
<p>I do question if a permanent advisory committee is needed, especially if we 
continue to hear from the district board.</p> 
<p>Pam Morrow</p> 
<p><b>Angel in shorts</b></p> 
<p>Dear Editor:</p> 
<p>Living here in Pagosa Springs, we are accustomed to hearing about the great 
people who live here, how helpful everyone is in a time of need, all those 
kudos that make us feel good about those who share living in this beautiful 
community. Well, here's another.</p> 
<p>On Sunday, my daughter and I decided to take a short walk in the forest off 
Turkey Springs Road. Equipped with three dogs on leashes, 8 ounces of water and 
12 ounces of tea, we headed out. After about two hours of walking, we thought 
we might be on the wrong road, but surely we would come to it soon.</p> 
<p>After three hours, heavy rain, thunder, lightning and some hail, we 
admitted we were in serious trouble. As we walked and prayed for some kind of 
help, the sharp realities became clear. No one knew where we had gone, we had 
no jackets, no food, our water was nearly gone, and we were wet, cold and lost.
</p> 
<p>As we came out of the tall trees and crossed into an open field, we 
suddenly spotted a lone runner. Our guardian angel in running shorts! My 
daughter called out to him for help and he stopped to wait for us, a wet, 
bedraggled muddy sight we must have been. His name was Reed. He told us where 
we were, gave us directions and said after his run, he would meet us at the 
gate at the end of the trail. As he ran off, we headed up the trail, thanking 
God for sending him, but also praying that he would meet us at the gate.</p> 
<p>True to his word, ahead on the path was Reed. He had gone home to collect 
water, jackets and power bars for us. He walked with us to make sure we didn't 
miss the gate and then loaded the entire muddy troop into his very clean car 
and drove us back to where we had left our car. He even waited to make sure the 
car keys hadn't been lost during our 4 1/2 hour walk and if the car would 
start. Then, with a final wave, he drove off into the sunset.</p> 
<p>We just want to thank Reed for his kindness and to warn others about 
wandering off into the forest unprepared, even for a short Sunday walk. We know 
how blessed we are to be able to tell the story.</p> 
<p>Thanks again, Reed, for everything you did for us. We're proud to say you 
lived up to the Pagosa tradition of helping others.</p>

<p><b>Fix it</b></p> 
<p>Dear Editor:</p> 
<p>Gene Cortright's letter of expos&eacute; in the June 12 SUN pinpointing 
some of the &quot;Commissioner Watchers&quot; concerns hit the nail right on 
top of the old, but still infamous &quot;Three Amigos&quot; sombreros.</p> 
<p>Somehow, I seriously doubt that the taxpaying voter of Archuleta County 
would be terribly surprised that the previous two-vote board of Amigos would 
quietly eliminate then-existing regulations requiring two separate public 
hearings before a permit could be issued to build an industrial facility in the 
county.</p> 
<p>So how have these astute county voters demonstrated that they are keenly 
aware of previous Amigo board tactics? Easy answer: They were smart enough to 
send one of the Amigos packing in the last election for county commissioner by 
a large majority just so there would be no more concrete batch plant fiascos, 
etc., erected in the county.</p> 
<p>So, what did the old two-vote Amigos do to vainly attempt keeping 
industrial facility approval alive and well while keeping the heat and work off 
themselves?</p> 
<p>Well, they cleverly placed all the work load and decision making directly 
on the planning commission so no one in the future could point fingers in their 
direction. Guess what? It ain't gonna work. The ruse has now been publicly 
identified.</p> 
<p>I would now hope that with the new commissioner board in place and one of 
the two-vote Amigos being eliminated, that the currently seated commissioners 
would accept their responsibilities to the local voter by correcting the 
problem.</p> 
<p>Should the commissioners choose not to accept this mission, they will 
surely dive into self-destruct mode and I'd bet be held accountable by the 
voters in future commissioner elections. They will be rudely roused and 
expeditiously ousted.</p> 
<p>County commissioners are getting paid over $45,000 a year plus magnificent 
benefits. Archuleta County voters want the buck to stop at your desks - not the 
planning commissioners who receive zero bucks.</p> 
<p>So get to work, fix it - now!</p> 
<p>Jim Sawicki</p> 
<p><b>Plan language</b></p> 
<p>Dear Editor:</p> 
<p>Your comment on the recent asphalt plant permit by Planning Office 
personnel and the need for additional regulations prompts this letter.</p> 
<p>As a former planning commissioner, I was one of those who helped develop 
the language for the Conditional Use Permit and its predecessor PUD 
counterpart. After implementation, it became apparent that the provisions were 
too inclusive for many applications - thus the revision that allowed for 
approval by the planning office.</p> 
<p>I specifically remember the case involving a boat storage operation on 
Navajo Reservoir. The owner wished to add storage for a few more boats. The use 
would not change; there would be no impact on the area, the traffic, or the 
community, so there seemed no real need for more than planning office review.
</p> 
<p>After lengthy study and review, the planning office and the planning 
commission, in conjunction with the county attorney, added new language to the 
subdivision regulations to address this specific type of situation, and it was 
approved by the county commissioners.</p> 
<p>At no time did anyone suggest that the language could be interpreted such 
that it would allow a gravel operation to be replaced by an asphalt plant, or 
that an extension of any use previously required to cease on a given date could 
be given with only planning office approval.</p> 
<p>One tends to suspect that the proponent's attorney decided to justify his 
fee by nitpicking the regulations to the detriment of all involved, including 
the proponent and the public.</p> 
<p>It has been my experience that by being open and involving the public, most 
issues can be resolved in a positive manner. This did not happen.</p> 
<p>If the subdivision regulations are at fault, then revision at the earliest 
opportunity should be undertaken.</p>

<p><b>Evaluate care</b></p> 
<p>Dear Editor:</p> 
<p>To those citizens who elected me to serve on the Upper San Juan Health 
Services District Board of Directors:</p> 
<p>I became interested in serving on this board because of concerns regarding 
honesty and integrity throughout our health care services.</p> 
<p>My volunteer activities in this community have spanned a variety of 
interests - early childhood education, health of our senior citizens, 
assistance to folks in crisis, and activities of our local service clubs.</p> 
<p>My only agenda with anything I do is and always has been focused on making 
things better for individuals and our community as a whole.</p> 
<p>Now that a recall petition has been submitted to the county clerk, it will 
be for you to observe the activities and accomplishments of the current 
directors of our health services board over the coming months - and then you 
will make a decision as to whether these volunteers are meeting the basic 
health care needs of all our citizens, regardless of income; and if you are 
pleased with the care you receive when an emergency occurs for you or someone 
in your family.</p> 
<p>I am proud to have sponsored Charles Hawkins' membership on this board and 
in turn, his election as chairman. Charles is a good listener to all views, 
shares information with board members for their ideas and operates in an open, 
honest manner with all parties.</p> 
<p>I may be criticized, as I have been by some, for my letters to the public; 
however, the last time I looked, this is America and I believe I have an 
obligation to let the public know not just my views but those expressed to me 
by others.</p> 
<p>Regardless of assessment of my volunteer efforts on this board, please know 
that I will have no regrets from my service, as I intend to &quot;give it my 
all&quot; so long as I serve.</p>

some interesting watergun fights last year) as well as a hearty appetite, as 
Dawnie always cooks a lot of food.</p> 
<p>Cost is a suggested donation of $2.50 for those 60-plus and a firm $4.50 
for those under 60.</p> 
<p>On June 21, we will have a group head up to Creede to attend &quot;A Tuna

<p><b>VA health care back to being income based</b></p> 
<p><b>By Andy Fautheree</b></p> 
<p><b>SUN Columnist</b></p> 
<p>Over the past two years I have enrolled hundreds of Archuleta County 
veterans in VA Health Care.</p> 
<p>It has proven to be very beneficial to these veterans in receiving quality 
health care at a very reasonable cost.</p> 
<p>For many, it was a godsend for low-priced prescription drugs through the VA 
mail order pharmacy program. </p> 
<p>Situations of VA health care availability have changed directions several 
times during these two years. </p> 
<p>As many of you know, a new VA Health Care priority system was initiated 
Jan. 17, 2003. Some veterans were affected by these rule changes. Basically, VA 
health care is now back to being income based. However, if you were already 
enrolled prior to that date, you are &quot;grandfathered&quot; in the system, 
and can continue to receive the same health care.</p> 
<p>If you are a new enrollee and your income is above a certain level and you 
do not have any service-connected disabilities you will not be able to obtain 
VA health care at this time, though I believe this could change in the near 
future. </p> 
<p><b>VAHC locations</b></p> 
<p>Two years ago, the Farmington VA Clinic was taking new patients. The 
Durango VA Clinic was not yet in existence. A contract clinic in Chama was able 
to see VA patients under a special VA contract agreement. Grand Junction VA 
Medical Center was still taking new patients.</p> 
<p>Now, however, the Farmington VA Clinic is no longer accepting new patients 
unless they meet the new, very high VA priority rating.</p> 
<p>Durango Clinic is now in full operation and providing excellent care. </p> 
<p>Grand Junction VA Medical Center is no longer able to take new patients 
except with a high VA priority rating like Farmington.</p> 
<p>The clinic in Chama, under the Health Care Centers of Northern New Mexico, 
is still in ongoing negotiations for the past year to ink a new contract, which 
may or may not happen.</p> 
<p><b>We have options</b></p> 
<p>So, where does that leave our local veterans? </p> 
<p>Fortunately, located where we are we have options available to us. Veterans 
living in large metro areas such as Albuquerque or Denver do not have these 
options. For the most part, they can't get into the overcrowded VA medical 
facilities unless they have that very high priority rating mentioned earlier, 
or are placed on some very, very long waiting list.</p> 
<p>I am currently recommending Archuleta County veterans transfer their health 
care to the Durango VA Clinic. I have recently visited this facility and met 
with the staff there, and am very impressed with the personal, quality level of 
health care they provide.</p> 
<p>Dr. Daniel Hepburn is the physician. Janice Short is the nurse. Paula Jones 
is the office manager.</p> 
<p>As I was meeting with this staff the Qwest phone company was busy 
installing additional phone lines to meet the increased demand for 
communication. Communications with the Durango office should be much improved 
almost immediately, which had been a frequent complaint in the past. Also, some 
of the issues recently raised by the clinic staff in a Durango news story are 
being resolved.</p> 
<p>There are some obvious and not so obvious reasons for recommending this 
change of VA health care providers.</p> 
<p><b>Transfer to Durango</b> </p> 
<p>Durango is able to provide the quality care and see new patients on a 
relatively short appointment schedule.</p> 
<p>Farmington is quite a bit further away than Durango for our veterans to 
travel. Farmington clinic used to be able to authorize low-income veterans from 
Archuleta County for travel reimbursement. However, it is no longer able to do 
that. The policy in effect, as Farmington explained to me, is - since the 
veteran from here has the option to go to Durango - that's where they should go 
and Farmington no longer pays the travel allowance.</p> 
<p>The rule of thumb for travel allowance pay is the veteran has to drive over 
100 miles for VA health care services, to the nearest VA health care facility.
</p> 
<p>There is really no need for our veterans to continue to travel to Grand 
Junction for their health care services. The same care can be provided now to 
VA facilities much closer to home. And, they do not pay any travel allowance 
that I am aware of.</p> 
<p><b>Chama VA patients</b> </p> 
<p>The Chama community clinic providing VA health care under their special 
contract situation may not always be able to provide that care.</p> 
<p>Also, the Chama clinic frequently changes physicians, or has temporary 
medical care providers, who sometimes are not too familiar with the VA health 
care system. There have been numerous billing errors to our veterans through 
the Chama office.</p> 
<p>Since the Durango Clinic can see these same clients, it may be a good 
opportunity to transfer to Durango. The &quot;Chama connection&quot; was 
established back in the days in between when Farmington was closed to new 
patients and Durango was not open yet. The situation has changed, and I would 
recommend these veteran patients transfer their VA health care to Durango VA 
Clinic. </p> 
<p>If you are already in the VA health care system you can transfer to the 
Durango clinic by calling 247-2214. They will be happy to assist you in setting 
up your first appointment with them.</p> 
<p>Once that appointment is made, your VA medical records will be transferred 
to the Durango office. You will still go to Albuquerque VA Medical Center for 
higher-level specialist care. Of course new VAHC applications are automatically 
enrolled for Durango.</p> 
<p><b>Financial means test</b> </p> 
<p>On another important note, most veterans enrolled in VA health care need to 
provide a financial &quot;means test&quot; report every year.</p> 
<p>This is done on the standard VA 1010EZ form. I have noticed recently that 
some of our veterans have experienced appointment problems if they have not 
completed this financial report in over a year. Originally, veterans could 
waive this information and just agree to pay the co-pays. This has changed, and 
these same veterans must now provide the financial information to remain in VA 
health care.</p> 
<p>I would urge you to stop by my office with your financial information 
including wage earnings, pension or compensation income, out of pocket medical 
expenses, owned real estate values, investments and the like.</p> 
<p>I will assist you in preparing the form and then keep it on file here, so 
that each year in the future we can update the form and I can fax it to the VA 
for you. The form does require a signature. All VA record keeping information 
is confidential.</p> 
<p>For information on these and other veterans benefits please call or stop by 
the Veterans Service Office located on the lower floor of the county 
courthouse. The office number is 264-2304, the fax number is 264-5949, and 
e-mail is afautheree@archuletacounty.org. The office is open 8 a.m.-4 p.m., 
Monday through Thursday, Friday by appointment. Bring your DD Form 214 
(Discharge) for registration with the county, application for VA programs, and 
for filing in the VSO office.</p>

<p><b>Going to 'Nunsense II'?</b></p> 
<p><b>One trip won't be enough</b></p> 
<p><b>By Sally Hameister</b></p> 
<p>&quot;Nunsense II, The Second Coming&quot; premieres this weekend, and I 
can't wait.</p> 
<p>I'm sure those Little Hoboken Sisters have been saving up all their antics 
the past couple of years since we were regaled with their outrageous 
shenanigans in the original production of &quot;Nunsense.&quot; If I'm not 
mistaken, that one set some attendance records as well as sent the laugh meter 
right off the charts.</p> 
<p>Anyone who attended could pretty much describe Mary McKeehan's (Sister Mary 
Regina) unforgettable, bruise-inducing episode with a stool as well as Joan 
Hageman's (Sister Amnesia), well, amnesia. I think I only missed one 
performance last time and may have to miss one this time, but count on seeing 
me for most performances.</p> 
<p>&quot;Nunsense II, The Second Coming&quot; is presented by the Pagosa 
Springs Music Boosters with Michael DeWinter directing, Lisa Hartley as musical 
director and Dale Morris handling the choreography.</p> 
<p>Shows will be presented at 7:30 p.m. in the Pagosa Springs High School 
auditorium June 20, 21, 26, 27 and 28 with a 3 p.m. matinee June 22.</p> 
<p>Reserved seating tickets may be purchased at The Plaid Pony and at 
Moonlight Books. Adult tickets are $12, seniors are $10, and children and 
students are $6.</p> 
<p>Please call 731-5262 for more information. I assure you that one 
performance simply won't be enough.</p> 
<p><b>Hanging baskets</b></p> 
<p>For those 100 folks who ordered the Chamber hanging baskets, expect a 
visitor tomorrow with your delivery, barring no unforeseen disasters.</p> 
<p>You lucky devils will receive a gorgeous basket (or the appropriate numbers 
ordered) delivered by a real, live board director or staff member. Good grief, 
does it get it get any better than that?</p> 
<p>We are delighted with the enthusiastic response we've received this year 
and hopefully will offer this opportunity every year. Thank you all for 
supporting the &quot;Pretty Up Pagosa Project.&quot;</p> 
<p><b>Dining Guide</b></p> 
<p>One final reminder to all our restaurant members that the Dining Guide will 
go to the printer tomorrow, and you just don't want to be left out of this 
important publication.</p> 
<p>We print thousands of them at a time, and it is our experience that just 
about everyone who walks through the Visitor Center door wants to eat.</p> 
<p>Not everyone is planning to stay overnight or for any length of time, but 
most are very interested in food - where to find it, how much it costs, anon, 
anon. All of that is covered in the Dining Guide which generally falls into the 
hands of 35,000 to 45,000 hungry guests each year.</p> 
<p>It simply doesn't make sense for any eating establishment not to appear in 
our guide because, frankly, if you are not a Chamber member our Diplomats 
cannot and will not recommend you to the thousands who visit us every year.</p> 
<p>Please give Morna a call at 264-2360 right away if you want to be included 
in this year's guide and she can fax you something post haste.</p> 
<p>Remember, too, that the Chamber works for you regardless of where you are 
in Pagosa Springs. All of our marketing efforts are for each and every member 
and have nothing at all to do with whether you are in town, west of town or 
east of town. We sell the collective Pagosa Springs' businesses and try with 
all our might to help every business member as much as possible. </p> 
<p><b>Alive and well</b></p> 
<p>This has already been an extremely challenging summer for all the merchants 
and businesses located on Hot Springs Boulevard, and I'm afraid it's not over 
and won't be for awhile.</p> 
<p>We want to assure you that everyone is open for business and would welcome 
your visit to their establishment even though it may be a little challenging to 
reach them from time to time.</p> 
<p>Just so you know, the member businesses located in the Chamberhood are 
Seeds of Learning, Dr. Chen's San Juan Acupuncture Clinic, SW Colorado Mental 
Health Center, The Spa at Pagosa Springs, The Springs Resort, The Spring Inn, 
Juan's Mountain Sports, Astara Clothing and Jewelry, Harmony Works, Massage at 
the Springs, Best Western Oak Ridge Lodge and Squirrel's Pub and Pantry, Bank 
of the San Juans and, of course, the local U.S. Post Office.</p> 
<p>We all appreciate that the results of the road construction will be 
awesome, but sometimes progress can be a painful process especially with the 
loss of business.</p> 
<p>We always encourage you to &quot;Shop Pagosa First&quot; from the far west 
of town to the far east, but just want to remind you about the ones suffering 
in the &quot;war zones.&quot;</p> 
<p><b>Fly like an eagle</b> </p> 
<p>Wind Dancer Aviation Services, in cooperation with EAA Aviation Foundation 
Young Eagles program, is offering the &quot;Thrill of Flight&quot; this 
Saturday to youngsters between the ages of 8 and 17 at the Stevens Field 
Airport located at 777 Piedra Road.</p> 
<p>Beginning at 7 a.m., breakfast will be served for $4 prior to taking off 
into the wild blue yonder. These lucky young people will experience the thrill 
of a free flight with a local pilot and receive an official certificate as 
evidence of your flight to share with family and friends.</p> 
<p>To learn more about what promises to be an exciting day in the life of your 
child, please call the folks at Wind Dancer at 731-2127.</p> 
<p><b>Movin' members</b></p> 
<p>We are delighted to announce that two of our member businesses are trading 
places and moving up in the world.</p> 
<p>After more than five years at 140 Country Center, the Log Park Trading 
Company is moving downtown to the current location of Galles Properties - 
which, in turn is moving to the Log Park location in the Country Center. How's 
that for an entertaining &quot;teaberry shuffle?&quot;</p> 
<p><b>Membership</b></p> 
<p>We have three new members to introduce to you, one name change and eight 
renewals. It's a beautiful day in the neighborhood.</p> 
<p>We are very excited to announce this first new member because we've all 
watched its creation with great anticipation. Just in time for all kinds of 
summer fun is Bogey's Mini Golf brought to us by John Voden who resides in 
Conifer. You will find this unique establishment on the north side of Put Hill 
at 83 Pike Drive and for sure won't confuse it with any other business in 
Pagosa. It looks like pure family entertainment to me, and you can be sure I 
will try it out for myself at my earliest opportunity. This should be a great 
addition to our summer family entertainment services in Pagosa which can only 
help all of us in the end. You can reach these folks by phone at 264-5858. We 
thank Chamber board director Angie Gayhart for recruiting John to our 
membership and reward that good girl with a SunDowner pass (yep, even directors 
pay at the door).</p> 
<p>We next welcome yet another business designed for kids age 9 to 99: 
K.I.D.S. with Horses brought to us by Kristi Sweney at 109 Lisa's Court. 
K.I.D.S. offers natural horsemanship programs with a focus on building a 
relationship with horses based on love and respect. Kids from 9-99 are invited 
to join Kristi with their own horse or with one of hers. To learn more about 
K.I.D.S., please give Kristi a call at 731-1944.</p> 
<p>Our third new member is the Aspen Springs Metro District with a mailing 
address at PO Box 488 and phone contact at 731-3061.</p> 
<p>Our next members have renewed but with a name change that we are happy to 
share with you. Halina and Jacek Mrowca join us with Pagosa Springs Inn and 
Suites. This establishment was formerly the Red Lion Inn.</p> 
<p>Our other renewals this week include Kim Griffin with C's Deli and Ice 
Cream Parlor (previously the Juice 'n Scoop); Joyce Hopkins with Log Park 
Trading Company; Harold R. Thompson, D.M.D., P.C.; Paul Hansen with Mulch 
Factory; Kirsten Sheehan and Kathey Keyes with the Pagosa Baking Company; 
Sherry MacVeigh with Fire Ready of Pagosa Springs; James and John with JJ's 
Upstream Restaurant; and Pat Myers with Durango Credit and Collection Company, 
Inc. Many thanks to one and all for your continued support.</p>

<p><b>Librarians struggle for time to read for themselves </b></p> 
<p><b>By Lenore Bright</b></p> 
<p><b>SUN Columnist</b></p> 
<p>People assume that just because one works in a library, one gets to read a 
lot.</p> 
<p>Wrong.</p> 
<p>We get to skim, browse and jealously watch as the good new books go out. 
</p> 
<p>I finally got my hands on &quot;Forever,&quot; by Pete Hamill. (I had to 
borrow it from Joan Rohwer.)</p> 
<p>I may have written about this epic before, but I'm so taken with it, I must 
suggest it again to anyone interested in New York City history and/or the Irish 
immigrants.</p> 
<p>This is a story that begins in the 1700s and continues until today. The 
hero, Cormac O'Connor's life is intertwined with the secrets of Manhattan. His 
story is unforgettable drama.</p> 
<p>Another inspirational book I had the pleasure of reading is &quot;A Life 
Larger Than Pain &#151; The Pathway From Resignation to Renewal&quot; by Erv 
Hinds, M.D. It was donated by Kate Terry in memory of John Schoenborn.</p> 
<p>Dr. Hinds is a specialist in pain management and anesthesiology. He is a 
member of the International Spinal Injection Society. He is also the founder of 
the New Mexico Pain and Spine Center at Presbyterian Hospital in Albuquerque.
</p> 
<p>Dr. Hinds' book has become required reading for many physicians. One 
reviewer wrote, &quot; &#138; his audience is everyone, those hurting, those 
who remember hurting and those who worry about hurting in the future.&quot; The 
book relates spirituality and medical procedures with integrity. I can 
recommend it from personal experience.</p> 
<p>One paragraph reads, &quot;Our technical age has bred in us a preoccupation 
with technique and created the illusion that we are in control of our lives. It 
has fed our sense of entitlement to long life and physical beauty. Ancient 
wisdom recognized the shortcomings of such a perspective.&quot;</p> 
<p>Dr. Hinds reminds us that &quot;Loss has a way of forcing us to give up our 
personal agendas. When we stop making demands for what we want, we will have 
room to acknowledge what we have.&quot;</p>

<p><b>Community walks to support, remember </b></p> 
<p><b>and find a cure</b></p> 
<p><b>By Tess Noel Baker</b></p> 
<p><b>Staff Writer</b></p> 
<p>Cancer.</p> 
<p>To not be touched by this disease is almost impossible. </p> 
<p>Open a church bulletin and turn to the list of prayer requests, it'll be 
there.</p> 
<p>Call family, friends, and community members and eventually that six-letter 
word comes up. It can inspire any range of emotions - anger, pain, despair and 
hope.</p> 
<p>It is that hope that is the focus of Relay for Life, a fund-raiser for the 
American Cancer Society and its search for a cure, coming to Pagosa Springs 
Friday and Saturday.</p> 
<p>Twenty-four relay teams will walk from 6 p.m. Friday into the morning hours 
Saturday to remind people cancer never sleeps.</p> 
<p>Along the journey, teams will engage in several hilarious games and a 
little good-natured competition. Luminaria in support of or in memory of 
someone's courage in the battle with the disease will line the path through 
Town Park. A variety of yummy treats will fuel the walker's feet and push them 
on to dawn.</p> 
<p>It's one night of inspiration to fuel the fires to battle, to accept, to 
encourage, to help in the war against cancer.</p> 
<p>But it's just one way to spread hope to a cancer patient. Many more exist: 
providing transportation to and from treatment locations; phoning devastated 
relatives a half a continent away. A heartfelt prayer.</p> 
<p>Pagosan Doug Trowbridge has taken the phone call several times. Two words 
that signal the start of battle.</p> 
<p>&quot;It's cancer.&quot; </p> 
<p>His wife's brother-in-law. Two uncles. Most recently, his sister-in-law. 
All of them struggling a great distance away.</p> 
<p>&quot;It's very frustrating to try to provide support from here rather than 
being there in person,&quot; he said. </p> 
<p>&quot;Thank goodness for cell phones,&quot; his wife, Morna, added. 
Currently, the phone rings back and forth from New Jersey at least once a week, 
sometimes more, as the Trowbridges keep track of Doug's sister-in-law's 
condition and keep tabs on her husband.</p> 
<p>&quot;When he first called to tell us about it, I was as afraid for him as 
I was for her,&quot; said Doug. &quot;You could just tell in his voice, he was 
terrified.&quot;</p> 
<p>Since then, they have kept up the phone calls, sent cards, e-mailed some 
research information. Doug even flew to the East Coast in May to be there in 
person - at least for a little while - to offer his support.</p> 
<p>He also offered his own head. At least his scalp. As a little surprise, 
Trowbridge shaved his head bald to show solidarity with his sister-in-law. The 
cancer treatment had already robbed her of her hair and she had refused to show 
her bald scalp to anyone.</p> 
<p>&quot;Her hair was very special to her, it was down to her waist,&quot; he 
said. &quot;No one has seen her without her hair. I didn't know if this would 
be a catalyst for her to feel comfortable with that or just an opportunity to 
show support.&quot;</p> 
<p>In the end, it might not have been a catalyst, but it did provide some good 
laughs.</p> 
<p>&quot;She thought it was hilarious,&quot; Trowbridge said. Not only that, 
but the patient had a good week, and was able to enjoy the family gathered 
around her.</p> 
<p>That's what it's all about - creating joy, creating smiles, creating hope.
</p> 
<p>Susan and Tom Thorpe faced the disease for the first time three years ago 
while living in Cincinnati when routine testing revealed Tom had prostate 
cancer.</p> 
<p>&quot;This was the first experience with cancer for both of us,&quot; Sue 
said. &quot;Tom had not had any symptoms. There was no family history of 
cancer.&quot;</p> 
<p>To get through it, they leaned, first, on each other.</p> 
<p>&quot;Tom was the biggest support,&quot; Susan said. &quot;He decided we're 
going to take a good hard look and try to make the best of it.&quot;</p> 
<p>As for Susan, Tom said, she often gave him the perspective he needed to 
make decisions and helped him reassert control over his life. They also 
received support from friends, family and coworkers. Sometimes it was just a 
telephone call that helped. Other times it was information from people who had 
&quot;been there, done that.&quot;</p> 
<p>In the end, Tom decided on surgery, the most radical of the treatment 
options, and endured a long recovery process to give himself the best chance to 
beat the disease.</p> 
<p>&quot;The biggest challenge was getting to the point of being able to say 
the word cancer to people in public and own that and know that we were going to 
do everything we could to make that bug as miserable as possible,&quot; he said.
</p> 
<p>Following Tom's recovery, the couple moved to Pagosa Springs believing they 
had indeed beat the bug. Then tests showed otherwise. Radiation treatment would 
be necessary. </p> 
<p>Initially, the thought of enduring a new medical challenge in a brand new 
place was daunting, but the community came through. Their church placed him on 
the prayer list. They began to meet other survivors. And then there was the 
Road to Recovery program. For seven weeks, Tom said, these volunteers drove him 
to and from treatment, taking a load off Susan's mind and opening the door to 
meeting more new people.</p> 
<p>&quot;Those folks were just great,&quot; he said. &quot;They were 
empathetic and willing to help in any way they could.&quot;</p> 
<p>&quot;He got to meet just the most wonderful, supportive people,&quot; 
Susan added.</p> 
<p>Some of the other survivors were among the most important.</p> 
<p>&quot;As the caregiver,&quot; she said, &quot;There was a certain degree of 
feeling a little left out of this because I didn't have cancer - not in a 
negative way by any means - but I couldn't understand what Tom was going 
through spiritually and emotionally because it wasn't me that had cancer. I 
remember a number of times when I felt grateful he had other survivors to bond 
with. Likewise, I found a great deal of support as I got to know other 
caregivers.&quot;</p> 
<p>In the end, Tom said, it's all the little pieces of support put together 
that really matter. Anyone can help.</p> 
<p>The American Cancer Society Web site lists several ideas for people looking 
for ways to support friends, family and cancer patients. These include helping 
a patient organize the details of life, providing emotional support, becoming a 
patient advocate or becoming a cancer activist. It also lists several more 
concrete options. For instance, a person could:</p> 
<p>- offer to do research for the patient </p> 
<p>- send a meal or schedule meal deliveries for a patient and family </p> 
<p>- offer to help with childcare or schedule pickups and drop-offs at day care
</p> 
<p>- transport the patient to health care appointments </p> 
<p>- help run errands </p> 
<p>- offer to take phone calls for an afternoon if the patient is tired and 
needs rest</p> 
<p>- Coordinate visitors or sending cards, flowers or gifts to the patient </p>
<p>- contribute to related charities in the friend's name </p> 
<p>- plan a party when treatment is concluded or an anniversary milestone 
reached.</p> 
<p>Or shave that head and get on an airplane. Trowbridge said his haircut 
turned more than his family's heads.</p> 
<p>&quot;It's kind of funny,&quot; Trowbridge said. &quot;A lot of people are 
laughing and saying, 'Nice summer haircut.'&quot;</p> 
<p>Others simply struggle to come up with the words. They think he might be 
the one with cancer. Their friend. Their neighbor. &quot;They come up to me and 
they're doing everything not to ask. I tell them why I did it and they're so 
relieved.&quot; Some have even handed him money for the Relay once they hear 
his explanation.</p> 
<p>After all, everything helps in this war.</p> 
<p>For more information or ideas, stop by Town Park between 6 p.m. Friday and 
9 a.m. Saturday. Browse through the booths under the Big Top. Talk to a 
survivor, or just absorb the atmosphere and walk away with hope.</p> 
<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p> <b>Pagosa's Past</b> 
<p></p> 
<p><b>History awaits in a tour of nearby northern New Mexico</b></p> 
<p><b>By John M. Motter</b></p> 
<p><b>PREVIEW Columnist</b></p> 
<p>Diversity. A good, accurate one-word description of the people and 
landscape our pioneer forefathers encountered when settling the San Juan region 
of Colorado, New Mexico and Utah.</p> 
<p>As to landscape, consider driving for about one hour from Arboles in the 
southwestern corner of Archuleta to the summit of Wolf Creek Pass in Mineral 
County. Arboles is at best a semi-desert region with less than 10 inches a year 
of annual rainfall. Remove the irrigating ditches connected with Vallecito 
Reservoir and the area is arid, mostly unfit for agriculture. </p> 
<p>Still, Arboles has at least one major advantage over the otherwise 
well-watered, lush-by-comparison Wolf Creek Pass. Arboles has about a month 
longer growing season because it's elevation is about 5-6,000 feet, Wolf Creek 
above 10,000 feet.</p> 
<p>The point is, the first settlers had a wide range of diverse geography to 
figure out, much of the figuring done by trial and error.</p> 
<p>The problem was: How do we make a living here? At the time of settlement, 
roughly between 1860 and 1885, most people in this nation earned a living by 
growing crops or raising animals, or both. Geography and available resources 
provided the answer.</p> 
<p>Hard rock mining took care of itself. Naturally, the miners lived in towns 
near the mines, often at elevations as high as Wolf Creek Pass, towns such as 
Silverton and Summitville. And, just as naturally, the food to feed the miners 
had to be grown at lower elevations.</p> 
<p>And so, as the miners dug ore and built towns at high elevations, other 
settlers searched lower elevations for good agricultural land that could be 
irrigated. Agricultural communities sprang up along the Pine River near 
Bayfield and along the San Juan River in the vicinities of today's Farmington 
and Aztec.</p> 
<p>The farming communities along the lower San Juan River found themselves in 
direct competition with ranchers. Those first ranchers were cattle barons 
scattered throughout the San Juan Basin, but concentrated in the western part. 
In those early years before overgrazing, grass was abundant. Even at elevations 
above 10,000 feet with the very short summer season, grass grows knee deep. 
Cattle moved up and down the mountains taking advantage of seasonal grass 
productivity, just as the elk still do.</p> 
<p>Other communities popped up along the supply routes between the mines and 
the agricultural areas. One of those communities was Pagosa Springs.</p> 
<p>Pagosa Springs had no mineral deposits such as gold or silver or lead. It 
was not a mining town. Pagosa was also too high in elevation to be a major 
agricultural area. Pagosa did have good grass and supported a lively cattle and 
sheep industry. Certain root crops such as potatoes did well. And grains such 
as oats, wheat, and barley did well.</p> 
<p>But mainly, Pagosa was located along one of the main roads leading to the 
San Juan Basin and the mining communities around Silverton on the upper Animas 
River.</p> 
<p>While people were figuring out how to make a living in the upper and 
western part of the San Juan Basin, one settlement of communities, La Tierra 
Amarilla, already existed in the upper Chama River Valley of New Mexico 
Territory.</p> 
<p>La Tierra Amarilla was located on the main road connecting Santa Fe with 
the San Juan gold fields, the only passable road during the winter. 
Consequently, many of those first pioneers obtained their supplies from La 
Tierra Amarilla.</p> 
<p>Today, the best known community there called Tierra Amarilla is the Rio 
Arriba county seat. During first settlement of the San Juans, Tierra Amarilla 
was better known as Las Nutritas. La Tierra Amarilla described an area 
containing many communities.</p> 
<p>The oldest settlement may have been attempted in 1832 at a place called 
Ca&ntilde;ones, north of Brazos. Apparently the Utes discouraged that effort.
</p> 
<p>Other unsuccessful settlement attempts may have been made before permanent 
settlement was accomplished in 1860. Prior to 1860, settlement of La Tierra 
Amarilla may have been seasonal and &quot;whenever the Indians were quiet.&quot;
</p> 
<p>The earliest permanent settlements were at Los Brazos, La Puente, Los Ojos, 
Ca&ntilde;ones, Ensenada and Las Nutritas. Los Ojos appears to have been the 
principal commercial center during those early years.</p> 
<p>Those first settlers were mostly Hispanics from the Abiquiu area. A number 
of Anglos were included, however, including Thomas Burns who operated the 
general store in Los Ojos and later in Las Nutritas. Early San Juan Basin 
pioneers would likely have purchased supplies from Burns. He did supply hay and 
grain to Fort Lewis when it located in Pagosa Springs in 1878. Burns was the 
founder of Burns National Bank in Durango.</p> 
<p>Along about 1871, a new colony was established on the Tierra Amarilla near 
the abandoned El Barranco site north of Los Brazos. The New Mexico Stock and 
Agricultural Association of Chicago laid out a site for the town of Park View. 
Lots and a city hall location were staked out and a group of Swedish immigrants 
induced to settle there. The population reached as high as 75, but the effort 
proved to be a fraud and the inhabitants moved on to Colorado.</p> 
<p>Somehow, the nearby, but older community of Los Ojos became known as Park 
View, a mistake that was not corrected until 1972 when the community regained 
its original name.</p> 
<p>Tierra Amarilla is interesting for more than its historic function as a 
supply point for exploration and settlement of the San Juan Basin.</p> 
<p>Systematic architectural, historic and archeological surveys have been 
conducted in the area by the New Mexico State Historic Preservation Division 
since 1970. A large number of buildings typical of various phases of New Mexico 
Hispanic construction have been identified.</p> 
<p>A book titled &quot;La Tierra Amarilla, Its History, Architecture, and 
Cultural Landscape&quot; identifies and describes each of these buildings. Maps 
are included so that anyone can locate the buildings. In addition, much history 
is included telling about who built and occupied the buildings. Authored by 
Chris Wilson and David Kammer, the book was printed by the Museum of New Mexico 
Press, P.O. Box 2087, Santa Fe, N.M. 87504-2087.</p> 
<p>The book's foreward was written by Robert J. Torrez, State Historian, New 
Mexico Records Center and Archives. Torrez grew up in the area.</p> 
<p>Another good source of information about the area is &quot;La Tierra 
Amarilla: The People of the Chama Valley,&quot; edited by Anselmo F. Arellano 
and published by Chama Valley Independent Schools, District 19, Tierra 
Amarilla. Torrez also wrote the introduction for this book.</p> 
<p>Anyone living in Pagosa Country with an interest in history and an eye for 
Hispanic architecture would enjoy visiting the area. The five communities 
mentioned along with 21 structures and seven acequias, or irrigation systems, 
are included on the New Mexico Register of Cultural Properties and the National 
Register of Historic Places.</p> 
<p>The drive from Pagosa Springs to the area requires less than an hour. 
Several decent eating establishments are available, especially for those with 
palates craving Southwest cooking. While Chama is not included in the subject 
area, Chama is an old railroad town with more commercial establishments, gift 
shops, motels, and restaurants. Chama could be included on the tour. </p>

<p></p> 
<p><b>It's all in the giving</b></p> 
<p>It is not unusual to hear the remark: &quot;Every time you turn around, </p>
<p>someone comes at you with their hand out, looking for a dona-</p> 
<p>tion.&quot; It is not unusual to hear someone note an increase of people 
and organizations seeking contributions from the residents of Pagosa Country.
</p> 
<p>It's true.</p> 
<p>As is the assertion that government cannot and should not attempt to meet 
every need of every citizen: government is too clumsy, too rule-bound, too 
inefficient to do so.</p> 
<p>It is the private sector that serves to fill the holes in the social fabric.
</p> 
<p>There are many causes and needs to be served. Rather than being 
distressing, this realization illuminates things about us that are bracing, 
that inspire confidence. </p> 
<p>Our response to requests for charity defines our character and heart as a 
community - and we look quite healthy.</p> 
<p>In a time when news too often concerns greed, selfishness, corruption, 
dishonesty and mean-spirited discourse, it is refreshing to realize we are, 
despite it all, a generous and caring people. It is comforting to know that we 
continue, in the face of increasing demand, to be so.</p> 
<p>The residents of Pagosa Country have remained generous, amping up their 
efforts in direct proportion to our overall economic success.</p> 
<p>We lend our support, year in and year out to causes that vary widely in 
terms of their goals.</p> 
<p>For example, tomorrow night, the annual Relay for Life starts in Town Park. 
Pagosa residents, their families and friends, will gather to walk the course, 
to raise money for the American Cancer Society. Participants and donors make 
their marks in this event in memory of those who have fought, and at times 
lost, battles to cancer and devote their energy to helping fund research that 
could someday find cures for the disease. The participants engage in the effort 
with great, good humor, and vitality. Every year, they do a fine job. And those 
who give do a fine job as well.</p> 
<p>Serving an entirely different end, the local high school booster club is 
currently raising funds to support extracurricular activities. There are also 
several private sport clubs in the area that raise funds and provide programs 
for youngsters. There are church groups that serve our youth, funded by 
generous patrons. They do so for the indigent and elderly as well.</p> 
<p>Habitat for Humanity builds homes, helped by donated funds and volunteer 
labor</p> 
<p>Civic organizations raise funds with charity nights, golf tournaments, 
dinners, donations of sales commissions, to provide money for scholarship 
funds. It would be a task to figure the number of local graduates who have 
benefited from the work of these organizations, the number of young people 
whose educations beyond high school have been boosted by fellow Pagosans.</p> 
<p>The same holds true for the many people, victims of accidents and disease, 
whose medical expenses have been eased because their neighbors pitched in to 
help them.</p> 
<p>Even the animals benefit from our generosity. Much of the local humane 
society's work is funded with donations.</p> 
<p>Yes, there are more hands held out. And, with ongoing state budget woes, 
there will be more hands joining the crowd soon asking for our help keeping 
valuable efforts alive. </p> 
<p>Many of us, newcomers and old-timers alike, express a desire to &quot;get 
involved.&quot;</p> 
<p>The best kind of involvement is participation in one of the many charitable 
organizations and events in this community. To get to know who we really are 
and what we are about, there is no better way than to lend a hand where it is 
most needed.</p>

<p><b>Obsolesence or personal touch? </b></p> 
<p><b>By Richard Walter</b></p> 
<p>Engineered obsolescence has hit the Walter family.</p> 
<p>Within weeks after the seven-year car warranty on the family buggy expired, 
the spectre of having it fall apart loomed.</p> 
<p>It seemed like just a minor repair would be needed at first.</p> 
<p>But, let me set the scenario, one that might have been funny had it not 
been so rattling.</p> 
<p>Driving east on Pagosa Street, I signalled for a right turn onto 2nd Street.
</p> 
<p>I knew something was wrong when the signal lever was still in my hand after 
the turn.</p> 
<p>Modern vehicles have every conceivable control element built into one 
central, handy area, like the turn signal lever.</p> 
<p>Imagine my chagrin as the windshield washer solvent kept pumping away until 
the container was empty.</p> 
<p>The turn signal was still blinking and there appeared no way to turn it off.
</p> 
<p>The wipers, after the washer fluid was gone, reverted to delay mode, making 
one swipe every 30 seconds or so.</p> 
<p>I got home and examined the situation. The lever appeared to be a plug in 
apparatus with a plastic shield which now had one side missing.</p> 
<p>I tried plugging it back in and succeeded in getting the turn signal to 
stop blinking - perhaps, as it turned out, permanently. But, when I turned the 
headlights on, they were on high beam and the signal lever would not kick them 
down to low. </p> 
<p>I took the car to Scott, who has done wonders for me before, and was told 
it needed to go to someone more experienced, someone with the right tools, 
someone, I guess, who wouldn't laugh.</p> 
<p>Wasn't what I wanted to hear.</p> 
<p>I found myself trying to remember to open the window to signal for right 
and left turns and sat trying to squirm out of sight, hiding from recognition, 
my arm out the window and the wiper blades sweeping periodically at every stop 
light.</p> 
<p>Not a cloud in the sky, no sign of rain, and here's some nut with his 
windshield wipers on, trying as hard as he can to stay incognito.</p> 
<p>On second thought, maybe it's not planned obsolescence, maybe just the 
curse of the personal touch.</p> 
<p>After all, my recent experience with a semi-new lawnmower still under 
warranty was just as mysterious.</p> 
<p>Used only four times during from purchase through the year of drought, I 
planned to get my yard back to respectability this year. Got a new blade and 
had Plumber put it on.</p> 
<p>Worked like a charm, for about half of the yard. And then the engine 
stopped. Electrical short? Bad cord? Nope. Indicator light shows power reaching 
the machine but it just doesn't run.</p> 
<p>As this is being written it is still out for repair on warranty. Nearly 
new, brightly polished, and inoperable. I never even got to use the handy, 
dandy side bag grass catcher. </p> 
<p>Just got a callback from Cody saying replacement of the signal-remote unit 
master control arm is complete.</p> 
<p>If you're one of those who laughed, your time has run out - and I can sit 
up in the seat again.</p>

<p>Taken from Pagosa Springs New Era files of June 20, 1913</p> 
<p>Many of the trees in the park are apparently dying owing it is believed to 
the roots and bases of the trees being covered deeply in sand by the big 1911 
flood.</p> 
<p>The deaf and dumb lady who was not deaf and dumb, the lady who smiled 
engagingly from under costly willow plumes got away with about $60 of the 
moneys of Pagosa's chivalrous male population before the marshal gave her a 
scare that caused her to quit the town without waiting for the train.</p> 
<p>Marshal McConnel informs us that the deaf and dumb lady, her affinity and 
the bull terrier were taken into custody in Chama. The railroad town apparently 
got a tip of what was headed its way.</p> 
<p><b>75 years ago</b></p> 
<p>Taken from SUN files of June 22, 1928</p> 
<p>A &quot;baker's dozen&quot; of men gathered at the H.A. Bryant ranch north 
of town Tuesday to participate in an old-fashioned &quot;barn raising.&quot; 
They spent a good day at labor, in which much effective work was accomplished, 
and also participated in a mammoth dinner, prepared by Mrs. Bryant.</p> 
<p>A fire completely destroyed the former Houser Lumber Manufacturing Company 
planing mill, located near the depot about two o'clock Wednesday morning. It 
had made such headway when discovered that little could be done toward 
extinguishing the enormous blaze. Light, power and telephone lines went out of 
commission because of the fire, but were again put in repair on Wednesday.</p> 
<p><b>50 years ago</b></p> 
<p>Taken from SUN files of June 19, 1953</p> 
<p>The building around town continues and several new projects have been 
started. The Chevron Station is being completely rebuilt and new tanks being 
put in. The dirt from the excavation is being dumped over the bank on main 
street and will eventually widen the street for more parking space. The Basin 
Court is practically completed, as are the additions at Vic's Service Station. 
All in all there appears to be more building than othe</p> 
<p>r years in and around town.</p> 
<p>Sunday will see hot rod auto races at the Red Ryder Round-Up grounds. It 
appears that even more thrills are in store for those who attend than were 
present at the last race. It is expected that about 1,000 new seats will be in 
readiness giving the fans a better view of the races.</p> 
<p><b>25 years ago</b></p> 
<p>Taken from SUN files of June 22, 1978</p> 
<p>State Highway Department crews have completed the overlay of the highway 
through town and it is a very decided improvement. Painting of center lines and 
crosswalks remains to be done, but the new oil coat has improved the appearance 
and surface of the highway about 100 percent.</p> 
<p>It has been hot and dry in these parts the past week with the mercury 
hitting a sweltering 82 degrees one day this week. The San Juan River is 
starting to recede and the peak of the spring runoff is past. There has been no 
precipitation and the fire danger is mounting. Campers, hikers, and others in 
the outdoors are urged to use caution when building fires.</p>
