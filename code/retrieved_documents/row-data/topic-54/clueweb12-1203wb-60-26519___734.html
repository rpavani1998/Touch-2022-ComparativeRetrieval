</p> 
<p>The circumstances of the South Sea Islanders, their habits, institutions, 
ceremonies, &amp;c., described in the preceding volume, represent the state of 
the inhabitants of Tahiti and the adjacent isles at the time of their 
discovery, and during a period antecedent to this, the extent of which it is 
not easy to ascertain. Such, also, was their state, without any other 
alteration than a knowledge of the use of fire-arms produced, for a number of 
years after the visits of Wallis, Cook, and Bligh. Accident, so far as Captain 
Wallis was concerned, made us acquainted with their existence. The advancement 
of knowledge, the benefit of those interested in scientific research&#150; 2 
&#150; in Britain and Europe, not the communication of the light of science to 
the uninformed inhabitants, prompted the successive visits which Captain Cook 
paid to their shores. The improvement of our West India colonies, by 
transplanting thither the most valuable indigenous productions of Tahiti, 
rather than a desire to impart to the inhabitants a knowledge of the arts and 
comforts of civilized life, led Captain Bligh to their shores; and purposes of 
justice, his successors. The improvement of native society, and, above all, the 
communication of the Christian religion to the people, does not appear to have 
been thought of, either by those who directed or performed the early voyages to 
the South Sea Islands. These visits were, however, in the arrangements of Him 
who ordereth all things after the counsel of his own will, preparing the way 
for this, in a manner which those by whom they were made neither designed nor 
anticipated.<br>
<br>
 Without admitting the existence of a power, alike at 
variance with common sense and religion, in virtue of which the pope authorized 
the commanders from Spain and Portugal to seize any country they might 
discover, for the purpose of bringing its plundered inhabitants within the pale 
of Christendom, or approving the proceedings of those who acted upon such 
authority; their object, the conversion of the idolaters, was one that must 
commend itself to every enlightened Christian; and their ardour was frequently 
proportioned to the importance they attached to the enterprise. This was 
conspicuous in the conduct of many of the voyagers of the sixteenth century, 
and presents them in striking contrast with their successors. Papists have 
often adduced the indifference of Protestants&#150; 3 &#150; to the propagation 
of their faith, as a proof of their heresy: yet supposing that many of the 
Portuguese and Spanish discoverers, who were Catholics, to have believed that 
their own was the true faith; while we commend their zeal, we cannot but 
condemn the violence and absurdity of their proceedings, in forcing what they 
called Christianity upon the tribes they discovered.27</p> 
<p>The published accounts of the voyages from Britain to the South Seas, in 
the latter part of the eighteenth century, produced a strong feeling of wonder 
and delight, and excited considerable interest in behalf of the inhabitants of 
the remote and isolated regions. Among those whose regards for the people were 
awakened, the late excellent.</p> 
<p>&#150; 4 &#150;</p> 
<p>Countess Dowager of Huntingdon was exceedingly solicitous that efforts 
should be made to convey to them a knowledge of the Christian religion. So 
strong was her desire on this subject, that she is said to have left it with 
the late Dr. Haweis as her dying charge, that he would attempt to accomplish 
it. About the same time, the publication of Letters on Missions, by the Rev. 
Melville Horne, directed the attention of British Christians to this subject; 
and, in 1795, a society, including among its founders and supporters liberal 
and enlightened ministers of the established church and dissenters, was formed, 
under the designation of the Missionary Society: its object was to send the 
gospel to heathen and other unenlightened nations. At the earnest 
recommendation of the late Rev. Dr. Haweis and others, the then 
newly-discovered islands of the South Sea were selected as the first scene of 
its exertions; and thirty individuals, who had volunteered their services, 
engaged to attempt the establishment of Missionary settlements in the 
Marquesian, Society, and Friendly Islands.<br>
<br>
 On the 10th of August, 
1796, they embarked in the Thames on board the Duff, a vessel which had been 
purchased to convey them to their destinations. This ship was under the command 
of Capt. James Wilson, who had retired, after a perilous and honourable career 
in the service of the Hon. East India Company, but who now generously offered 
to conduct the distant and adventurous voyage. On the 23d of September 
following, they took their final departure from Portsmouth. Their voyage, 
though protracted, was safe, and not unpleasant; and on the 4th of March, 1797, 
they had the satisfaction of beholding the high land of Tahiti in the distant 
horizon.</p> 
<p>&#150; 5 &#150;</p> 
<p>On the 7th of March, 1797, the Missionaries went on shore, and were met on 
the beach by the late Pomare and his queen, then called Otoo and Tetua; by them 
they were kindly welcomed, as well as by Paitia, an aged chief of the district. 
They were conducted to a large, oval-shaped native house, which had been but 
recently finished for Capt. Bligh, whom the natives expected to return. This 
building, the king and chiefs presented to the strangers as their dwelling: it 
was pleasantly situated on the western side of the river, near the extremity of 
Point Venus. To reclaim the inhabitants from superstition, to impart to them 
the truths of revelation, and to improve their present condition, were the 
objects that had brought them to Tahiti. How little such an event had been 
anticipated by Captain Wilson's predecessors, we may learn from the testimony 
of Captain Cook. Speaking of the departure of the Spanish Missionaries, and the 
prospect of any future European establishment in the islands, he observes, 
&#147;It is very unlikely that any measure of this kind should ever be 
seriously thought of, as it can neither serve the purpose of public ambition, 
nor private avarice; and without such inducements, I may pronounce that it will 
never be undertaken.&#148;28&#151;The natives were delighted to behold 
foreigners coming to take up their permanent residence among them; as those 
they had heretofore seen had been transient visitors, with the exception of the 
Spanish Missionaries and their attendants, and a Spaniard, who had saved his 
life by escaping from Langara's ship, while it was lying at anchor off Vaiarua, 
in Taiarabu, in March, 1773; at which time three of his shipmates were executed.
</p> 
<p>&#150; 6 &#150;</p> 
<p>From a Spanish account of Chiloe, &amp;c. published in 1791, it appears 
that, in 1772, two ships, sent by the Viceroy of Peru to survey the islands of 
the Pacific, visited Tahiti, and conveyed to Peru two natives, who were 
baptized there, and sent back, in 1774, with two Roman Catholic Missionaries. A 
house of wood was erected for these Missionaries, near the shore of Vaitapeha 
Bay, in Taiarapu. &#147;Before the ships departed, the Spanish commander called 
a meeting of the chiefs, who had taken the Missionaries under their protection, 
described the grandeur of his sovereign, and in formed them of his right to all 
the islands. The natives, (the account says,) demonstrated much complaisance, 
and, by acclamation, acknowledged the king of Spain, king of Otaheite and all 
the islands.&#148; In January, 1775, the ships returned, taking two other 
natives with them.29 The Missionaries do not seem to have held much, if any, 
intercourse with the people; they remained about ten months in the island, when 
the ships, in which they had arrived, returned, and they embarked for Lima. 
When Captain Cook visited Taiarapu, in 1777, he saw the house which they had 
left; it was divided into two rooms; loop-holes &#147;were cut all around, 
which served as air-holes, and, perhaps, might be meant to fire from with 
muskets.&#148;30 A wooden cross, inscribed with &#147;Christus vincit, et 
Carolus III. imperat, 1774,&#148; stood in front of the house, and near it was 
the grave of the commander of one of the ships, who died in 1774. The Spaniards 
left hogs, goats, and dogs, on the island; and, so far as these have proved 
serviceable to the people, their mission was beneficial.</p> 
<p>&#150; 7 &#150; When the Missionaries from England, who had now arrived, 
landed from the Duff, the chiefs and people were not satisfied with giving them 
the large and commodious Fare Beritani (British House,) as they called the one 
they had built for Bligh, but readily and cheerfully ceded to Captain Wilson 
and the Missionaries, in an official and formal manner, the whole district of 
Matavai, in which their habitation was situated. The late Pomare and his queen, 
with Otoo his father, and Idia his mother, and his most influential persons in 
the nation, were present, and Haamanemane, an aged chief of Raiatea, and high 
priest of Tahiti, was the principal agent for the natives on the occasion. The 
frontispiece, representing this singular transaction, is taken from an original 
painting in the possession of Mrs. Wilson, relict of the late Captain Wilson. 
It exhibits, not only the rich luxuriance of the scenery, but the complexion, 
expression, dress, and tautauing of the natives, with remarkable fidelity and 
spirit. The two figures on men's shoulders are the late king and queen. Near 
the queen, on the right, stands Peter the Swede, their interpreter, and behind 
him stands Idia, the mother of the king. The person seated on the right hand is 
Paitia, the chief of the district; behind him stand Mr. and Mrs. Henry, Mr. 
Jefferson, and others. The principal person on this side is Capt. Wilson; 
between him and his nephew, Mr. W. Wilson, stands a child of Mr. Hassel; Mrs. 
Hassel with an infant is before them. On the left, next to the king, stands his 
father Pomare, the upper part of his body uncovered in homage to his son, and 
behind him is Hapai, the king's grandfather. Haamanemane, the high-priest, 
appears in a crouching&#150; 8 &#150; position, addressing Captain Wilson, and 
surrendering the district.&#151;Haamanemane was also the taio, or friend, of 
Captain Wilson; and rendered him considerable service, in procuring supplies, 
facilitating the settlement of the Mission, and accomplishing other objects of 
his visit.<br>
<br>
 Presentations of this kind were not uncommon among the 
islanders, as a compliment, or matter of courtesy, to a visitor; and were 
regulated by the rank and means of the donors, or the dignity of the guests. 
Houses, plantations, districts, and even whole islands, were sometimes 
presented; still, those who thus received them, never thought of appropriating 
them to their own use, and excluding their original proprietors, any more than 
a visitor in England, who should be told by his host to make himself perfectly 
at home, and to do as he would if he were in his own house, would, from this 
declaration, think of altering the apartments of the house, or removing from it 
any part of its furniture. It is, however, probable, that such was their 
estimate of the advantages that would result from the residence of the Mission 
families among them, that, in order to afford every facility for the 
accomplishment of an object so desirable, and impart confidence to the 
Missionaries, as to their support, they were sincere in thus ceding the 
district. They might wish them to reside in it, exercise the office of chiefs 
over the whole, cultivate as much of it as they desired, and receive tribute 
from those who might occupy the remaining parts; but by no means perpetually to 
alienate it from the king, or chief, to whom it originally belonged. This they 
knew could not be done without their permission, and that permission they could 
at any time withhold. In 1801, when the Royal Admiral&#150; 9 &#150; arrived, 
Pomare was asked, when the Missionaries were introduced to him, if they were 
still to consider the district as theirs; and though he replied in the 
affirmative, and even asked if they wished the inhabitants to remove, it 
afterwards appeared that the natives considered them only as tenants at will. 
All that the settlers ever desired was, the permanent occupation of the ground 
on which their dwellings and gardens were situated; yet, in writing to the 
Society, in 1804, they remark, in reference to the district, &#147;The 
inhabitants do not consider the district, nor any part of it, as belonging to 
us, except the small sandy spot we occupy with our dwellings and gardens; and 
even as to that, there are persons who claim the ground as theirs.&#148; 
Whatever advantages the king or chiefs might expect to derive from this 
settlement on the island, they were not influenced by any desire to receive 
general or religious instruction. This was evident, from a speech once made by 
Haamanemane, who said that they gave the people plenty of the parau (word) talk 
and prayer, but very few knives, axes, scissors, or cloth. These, however, were 
soon afterwards amply supplied. A wish to possess such property, and to receive 
the assistance of the Europeans in the exercise of the mechanic arts, or in 
their wars, was probably the motive by which the natives were most strongly 
influenced.<br>
<br>
 Captain Wilson was, however, happy to find the king, 
chiefs, and people, so willing to receive the Missionaries, and so friendly 
towards them; and the latter being now settled with seeming comfort in their 
new sphere of labour, the Duff sailed for the Friendly Islands on the 26th of 
March.<br>
<br>
 Having landed ten Missionaries at Tongatabu, in the Friendly 
Islands, Captain Wilson visited and&#150; 10 &#150; surveyed several of the 
Marquesan Islands, and left Mr. Crook a Missionary there; he then returned to 
Tahiti, and on the 6th of July the Duff again anchored in Matavai Bay. The 
health of the Missionaries had not been affected by the climate. The conduct of 
the natives during his absence had been friendly and respectful; and supplies 
in abundance had been furnished. While the ship remained at Tahiti, Mr. W. 
Wilson made the tour of the island; the iron, tools, and other supplies for the 
Mission, were landed: the Missionaries, and their friends on board, having 
spent a month in agreeable intercourse, now affectionately bade each other 
farewell. Dr. Gilham having intimated to the Captain his wish to return to 
England, was taken on board, and the Duff finally sailed from Matavai on the 
4th of August, 1797.<br>
<br>
 The Missionaries returning from the ship, as 
well as those on shore, watched her course as she slowly receded from their 
view, under no ordinary sensations. They now felt that they were cut off from 
all but Divine guidance, protection, and support, and had parted with those by 
whose counsels and presence they had been assisted in entering upon their 
labours, but whom on earth they did not expect to meet again. Captain Wilson 
coasted along the south and western shores of Huahine, and then sailed to 
Tongatabu; where, after spending twenty days with the Missionaries, who 
appeared comfortably settled, he sailed for Canton, where he received a cargo, 
with which he returned to England, and arrived safely in the Thames; having 
completed his perilous voyage, under circumstances adapted to afford the 
highest satisfaction, and to excite the sincerest gratitude from all&#150; 11 
&#150; who were interested in the success of the important enterprise.<br>
<br>

 The departure of the Duff did not occasion any diminution in the attention of 
the natives to the Missionaries in Tahiti. Pomare, Otu, Haamanemane, Paitia, 
and other chiefs, continued to manifest the truest friendship, and liberally 
supplied them with such articles as the island afforded. As soon, therefore, as 
they had made the habitation furnished by the people for their accommodation in 
any degree comfortable, they commenced with energy their important work.<br>

<br> Their acquaintance with the most useful of the mechanic arts, not only 
delighted the natives, but raised the Missionaries in their estimation, and led 
them to desire their friendship. This was strikingly evinced on several 
occasions, when they beheld them use their carpenters' tools, cut with a saw a 
number of boards out of a tree, which they had never thought it possible to 
split into more than two, and make, with these, chests, and articles of 
furniture. They beheld with pleasure and surprise the daily progress in the 
building of a boat, upwards of twenty feet long, and six tons burden, which was 
ultimately finished; but when the blacksmith's shop was erected, and the forge 
and anvil were first employed on their shores, they were filled with 
astonishment. They had long been acquainted with the properties and uses of 
iron, having procured some from the natives of a neighbouring island,31 where a 
Dutch vessel, the African Galley,&#150; 12 &#150; belonging to Roggewein's 
squadron, had been wrecked, in 1722, upwards of forty years before they were 
visited by Captain Wallis. When the heated iron was hammered on the anvil, and 
the sparks flew among them, they fancied it was spitting at them, and were 
frightened, as they also were with the hissing occasioned by immersing it in 
water; yet they were delighted to see the facility with which a bar of iron was 
thus converted into hatchets, adzes, fish-spears, and fish-hooks, &amp;c. 
Pomare, entering one day when the blacksmith was employed, after gazing a few 
minutes at the work, was so transported at what he saw, that he caught up the 
smith in his arms, and, unmindful of the dirt and perspiration inseparable from 
his occupation, most cordially embraced him, and saluted him, according to the 
custom of his country, by touching noses. Iron tools they considered the most 
valuable articles they could possess; and a circumstance that occurred during 
the second visit of the Duff, will decisively shew the comparative value they 
placed upon gold and iron. The ship's cook had lost his axe, and Captain Wilson 
gave him ten guineas to try to purchase one from the natives, supposing that 
the intercourse already had with Europeans, would enable them to form some 
estimate of the value of a guinea, and the number of articles they could 
procure with it from any other ship that might visit the island; but, although 
the cook kept the guineas more than a week, he could meet with no individual 
among the natives who would part with an axe, or even a hatchet, in exchange 
for them.</p> 
<p>While some of the Missionaries were employed in the exercise of those arts 
which were adapted to make the most powerful impression upon the&#150; 13 &#150;
minds of the natives, others were equally diligent in exploring the adjacent 
country, planting the seeds they had brought with them from Europe and Brazil, 
and studiously endeavouring to gain an acquaintance with the native language, 
which they considered essential to the accomplishment of their objects. In this 
opinion they were correct; for whatever qualification a man may possess, unless 
he manifests application and ability sufficient to acquire the language of 
those among whom he labours, he will make but a very inefficient teacher.<br>

<br> The language was altogether oral; consequently, neither alphabet, 
spelling-book, grammar, nor dictionary existed, and its acquisition was a most 
laborious and tedious undertaking. On their arrival, they found two Swedes, 
Peter Hagersteine, and Andrew Cornelius Lind; the former had been wrecked in 
the Matilda, and the latter had been left by Captain New of the D&aelig;dalus, 
only a few years before the Missionaries arrived. Peter had a slight knowledge 
of the colloquial language of the natives; and in all their early 
communications with the chiefs and people, the Missionaries were glad to avail 
themselves of his aid as interpreter. He was a man of low education, and bad 
principles; and if he did not intentionally misrepresent the communications of 
the Missionaries, his statements must often have conveyed to the minds of the 
natives very erroneous impressions of their sentiments and wishes. From him, as 
an instructor, they derived no advantage; as he seldom came near them, 
excepting when he bore some message from the king, or the chief with whom he 
resided. The remarks of former voyagers, and the specimens of the language they 
had given, were of little service, as they could only be the names of&#150; 14 
&#150; the principal persons and things that had come under the notice of such 
individuals, and even in the representation of these, the orthography was as 
various as the writers had been numerous. In reference to their attempts to 
acquire the knowledge of Tahitian, they remarked, that they found all 
Europeans, who had visited Tahiti, had mistaken the language as to spelling, 
pronunciation, and ease of acquisition. In addition to the printed specimens, 
they had a small vocabulary, compiled by one of the officers of the mutineers 
in the Bounty, who had resided some months in Tahiti, prior to the arrival of 
the Pandora; when he was arrested, and brought a prisoner to England, where he 
was executed at Portsmouth. This vocabulary he left with the worthy clergyman 
who attended him in his confinement, and by him it was kindly given to the 
Missionaries; who found it more useful than every aid besides. On their voyage, 
they had carefully studied it, but though they were thus put in possession of a 
number of words, in their proper collocation they discovered that they had 
every thing to learn. They had arranged a number of words in sentences 
according to the English idiom, which they supposed would be serviceable on 
landing; but the use of which they soon found it necessary to discontinue. One 
of these sentences,<i> Mity po tuaana</i>, often afterwards amused the king, 
when he came to know what they intended by it. M<i>aitai</i> is good, <i>po</i> 
is night, and<i>tuaana</i> brother. Good-night, brother, was the sentiment 
intended; but if the natives understood the English word mighty, it would mean, 
Mighty night, brother; or, if they understood<i>mity</i> as their word <i>maitai
</i>, the phrase would be an assertion to this effect, Good (is the) night, 
brother.</p> 
<p>&#150; 15 &#150; The simple declaration, Good-night, brother, would be 
unintelligible to the Tahitians, though the language were correct; a 
corresponding wish among them would be,<i>Ia ora na oe i teie nei po</i>, 
&#147;May you have peace or life this night.&#148; This circumstance shews the 
difficulties they had to contend with, even when they had acquired the meaning 
of many of the substantives and adjectives in the language.<br>
<br>
 In these 
embarrassments they had no elementary books to consult, no preceptors to whom 
they could apply, but were frequently obliged, by gestures, signs, and other 
contrivances, to seek the desired information from the natives; who often 
misunderstood the purport of their questions, and whose answers must, as often, 
have been unintelligible to the Missionaries. A knowledge of the language was, 
however, indispensable; and many of the Missionaries employed much of their 
time in making excursions through the neighbouring districts, spending several 
days together with the chiefs at their own habitations, for the purpose of 
observing their customs, and obtaining an acquaintance with the words which 
they employed in social intercourse. This was the more necessary, as the 
natives who reside in those parts visited by shipping, soon pick up a few of 
the most common English phrases, which they assimilate as much as possible to 
the native idiom, and apply almost indiscriminately, supposing they are thereby 
better understood, than they would be if they used only native words; yet these 
words are so changed in a native's mouth, who cannot sound any sibilant, or 
many of our consonants, and who must also introduce a vowel between every 
double consonant, that no Englishman would&#150; 16 &#150; recognize them as 
his own, but would write them down as native words. Pickaninny is a specimen of 
this kind.<br>
<br>
 It was not in words only, but also in their application, 
that the most ludicrous mistakes were made by the people. &#147;Oli mani,&#148; 
a corruption of the English words &#147;old man,&#148; is the common term for 
any thing old; hence, a blunt, broken knife, and a threadbare or ragged dress, 
is called &#147;oli mani.&#148; A captain of a ship, at anchor in one of the 
harbours, was once inquiring of a native something about his wife, who was 
sitting by. The man readily answered his question, and concluded by saying, 
&#147;Oli mani hoi,&#148; she is &#147;also an old man.&#148;<br>
<br>
 Part of 
each day was by several devoted to the study of the language, while once a 
week, the whole met together for conversation and mutual aid. The only means 
they had of obtaining it was, by observing carefully the native sounds of 
words, and then writing down the characters by which they were expressed. In 
this they found great difficulty, from what generally proves a source of 
perplexity to a learner, in his first attempt at understanding a foreign 
tongue, viz. the rapidity with which the natives appeared to speak, and the 
want of divisions between the words. The singular fact of most of their 
syllables consisting of a consonant and a vowel, and a vowel always terminating 
both their syllables and their words, increased their embarrassment in this 
respect.<br>
<br>
 It was circumstance highly advantageous to the Missionaries, 
that the Tahitians were remarkably loquacious, often spending hours in 
conversation, however trivial its topics, patiently listening &#150; 17 &#150; 
to inquiries, and anxious to make themselves intelligible. Although among 
themselves accustomed to hear critically, and to ridicule, with great effect, 
any of their own countrymen who should use a wrong word mispronounce or place 
the accent erroneously on the one they used, yet they seldom laughed at the 
mistakes of the newly arrived residents. On the contrary, they endeavoured to 
correct them in the most friendly manner, and were evidently desirous that the 
foreigners should be able to understand their language, and convey their own 
ideas to them with distinctness and perspicuity.<br>
<br>
 When the 
Missionaries heard the natives make use of a word or sentence with which they 
were not already acquainted, they wrote it down, and repeated distinctly 
several times what they had written. If the natives affirmed that the word or 
sentence was correctly pronounced by the Missionary, it was left for more 
careful and deliberate investigation.<br>
<br>
 Sometimes they endeavoured to 
find out words, by presenting to the natives different combinations of the 
letters of their alphabet: thus they would pronounce the letters a a, and say, 
&#147;What is that?&#148; The natives would answer by pointing to the fibrous 
roots of a tree, or the matted fibres round the cocoa-nut stalk, which are 
called<i>aa</i>. They would then pronounce others, as a i, and ask what it 
meant; the natives, putting their hand to the back of the neck, and repeating<i>
ai</i>, told them that that part of the body was thus called. By this means 
they sometimes discovered the meaning of a variety of words, which they did not 
before know were even parts of the language. In speaking of their progress, 
shortly after they had commenced&#150; 18 &#150; this department of labour, 
they observe, &#147;We have already joined some thousands of words together, 
and believe some thousands yet remain.&#148; Still their progress was but slow, 
and one of them, who has perhaps made himself most familiar with the native 
tongue, has frequently assured me, he was ten years on the island, before he 
knew the meaning of the word<i>ahiri</i>, corresponding to the English word if, 
used only in connexion with the past tense of the verb to have, as, &#147;If I 
had seen,&#148; &amp;c.<br>
<br>
 While the Missionaries were thus employed, 
the chiefs continued friendly and attentive; the people, however, began to 
manifest that propensity to theft, which they evinced even on the first visits 
they received. This obliged the Europeans to watch very narrowly their 
property. Clothing and iron tools appeared to be most earnestly sought; and, 
not-withstanding the measures of security which they adopted, their 
blacksmith's shop was robbed by a native, who dug two or three feet into the 
ground on the outside, and, burrowing his way under the wall or side of the 
house, came up through the earthen floor within, and stole several valuable 
articles.<br>
<br>
 Their increased acquaintance with the people had awakened 
their deepest commiseration, when they beheld them, not only wholly given to 
idolatry, and mad after their idols, but sunk to the lowest state of moral 
degradation and consequent wretchedness. This furnished a powerful incentive to 
energetic perseverance in the acquisition of the language, that they might 
speedily instruct them in the principles of Christianity, and thereby elevate 
their moral character, and improve their present circumstances.</p> 
<p>&#150; 19 &#150;</p> 
<p>The Tahitian was the first Polynesian language reduced to writing. In 
acquiring a knowledge of its character and peculiarities, and reducing it to a 
regular system, the Missionaries had to proceed alone. In adapting letters to 
its sounds, forming its orthography, and exhibiting the vernacular tongue in 
writing to the people, presenting to the eye that which had before been applied 
only to the ear, and thus furnishing a vehicle by which light and knowledge 
might be conveyed through a new avenue to the mind, they were unaided by the 
labours of any who had preceded them, and were therefore the pioneers of those 
who might follow. That their difficulties were great, must be already obvious. 
They advanced with deliberation and care; and though the Tahitian dialect, as 
written by them, is doubtless imperfect, and susceptible of great improvement, 
the circumstance of its having formed the basis of those subsequently written, 
the ease with which it is acquired, and the facility with which it is used by 
the natives themselves, are evidences of its accuracy and its utility.<br>
<br>

 The Missionaries have been charged with affectation in their orthography, 
&amp;c. but so far from this, they have studied nothing with more attention 
than simplicity and perspicuity. The declaration and the pronunciation of the 
natives formed their only rule in fixing the spelling of proper names, as well 
as other parts of the language. They aimed at precision, and having adopted the 
English character, affixed to each letter a distinct and invariable sound. The 
letters of each word constitute the word, so that a person pronouncing the 
letters used in spelling a word, would, in fact, pronounce the word itself. 
Pursuing this plan,&#150; 20 &#150; they were under the necessity of presenting 
to the natives a mode of spelling different from that which had been given to 
Europeans in the narratives of early voyagers. They did this reluctantly. Their 
early associations and strongest predilections were all in favour of Otaheite, 
Ulitea, Otahaa, &amp;c. names which English voyagers had given to the scenes 
and persons they describe, and it was only from the firm conviction that such 
were not their native designations, that they adopted others. The orthography 
of Bougainville, who visited Tahiti in 1768, about twelve months after its 
discovery by Wallis, they found approximate nearer the native sounds than that 
which Captain Cook and his companions afterwards followed. The principal island 
Bougainville called Taiti, and his designations of other islands greatly 
resemble those given them by the people. In adjusting the spelling they have 
adopted, they did not follow any former visitors, but, having fixed their 
alphabet, they have invariably endeavoured, as accurately as possible, to 
express the names the natives use.<br>
<br>
 The Missionaries sought an early 
opportunity to unfold to the rulers of the nation the objects of their Mission, 
and, after several disappointments, held a public interview with Pomare, Otu, 
and other principal chiefs, in which they stated, as distinctly as possible, 
through the medium of Peter Hagerstien, as interpreter, their design in coming 
to reside amongst them;<i>viz</i>. to instruct them in useful arts, teach them 
reading and writing, and make known to them the only true God, and the way to 
happiness in a future state; urging the discontinuance of human sacrifices, and 
the abolition of infanticide. As an inducement to compliance with this last 
request, they offered to build a house &#150; 21 &#150; for the accommodation 
of the children that might be spared, whom they promised to nurse with 
attention equal to that which they paid to their own. The chiefs and people 
listened attentively to their proposal, appeared pleased, and said no more 
children should be murdered. It was, however, only a promise.<br>
<br>
 The 
distressing circumstances under which this unnatural and revolting crime was 
practised, and the awful extent to which it prevailed, was one of the first of 
the many horrid cruelties filling these &#147;dark places&#148; of paganism, 
that deeply affected them. More than once having received intimation of the 
murderous purpose of the parents, they had, when the period of childbirth drew 
nigh, used all their influence to dissuade them from its execution, offering, 
as a reward for this act of common humanity, articles highly valued by them. 
When these had failed to move the parents' hearts, and they could obtain no 
promise from either the father or mother, that they would spare the child, the 
wives of the Missionaries have, as a last resort, begged that the infant, 
instead of being destroyed, might be committed to their care. But the people 
were so much under the slavish influence of custom, that, with one or two 
exceptions, their efforts were unavailing, and the guilty murderers have in a 
few days presented themselves at the Missionary dwellings, not only with most 
affecting insensibility, but apparently with all the impudence of guilty 
exultation.<br>
<br>
 The persons and the habitations of the Missionaries had 
hitherto been secure, excepting from petty thefts; they were, however, 
occasionally alarmed by rumours of war. Haamanemane had formerly requested 
their aid in a descent he intended&#150; 22 &#150; to make upon Raiatea, for 
the recovery of his authority there; but this they had firmly declined. The 
pilfering habits of the people rendered it necessary for them to watch their 
property during the night; and the unsettled state of political affairs in the 
island indicating their exposure to the consequences of actual war, led them to 
consider the line of conduct it would be their duty under such circumstances to 
pursue. They were in the possession of fire-arms, which they had brought on 
shore solely with a view to intimidate the natives, and deter any, who, 
unrestrained by the influence of the chiefs who had guarantied their 
protection, might be disposed to attack them. The propriety of their using 
fire-arms was, however, questioned by some, and discussed by the whole body; 
who publicly agreed that it was not their duty even to inflict punishment upon 
those that might be detected in stealing their property, but to complain to 
their chiefs; and that they could take no part even with their friends, in any 
of their wars. They resolved that their arms should be used for defence only, 
in the event of an attack being made upon their habitations; and not even then, 
until every means of avoiding it had been employed. Some of the Missionaries 
carried their principles of forbearance so far, as to declare that, but for the 
exposure of the females even then it would not be right to have recourse to 
arms. Such were the views of the Missionaries, and the circumstances of the 
people, when an event transpired which altogether altered the aspect of affairs 
in reference to the Mission.</p>

<br>
 On the 6th of 
March 1798, exactly twelve months from the day on which the Duff first anchored 
in Matavai bay, a vessel arrived at Tahiti; which, being the first they had 
seen since the departure of Captain Wilson, excited considerable interest. She 
was boarded by three of the Missionaries at the mouth of the harbour, and found 
to be the Nautilus from Macao, commanded by Captain Bishop, and originally 
bound to the north-west coast of America for furs. Being driven by a heavy gale 
to Kamtschatka, and unable to pursue her intended voyage, she had altered her 
course for Massuefero, near the South American coast, but had been compelled by 
stress of weather to steer for Tahiti. The ship was in great distress, the crew 
in want of most of the necessaries of life, and the captain had nothing to 
barter with the natives for supplies, but muskets and powder.</p> 
<p>&#150; 24 &#150;</p> 
<p>These indeed were formerly the only articles of trade, with the exception 
of ardent spirits, that many adventurers ever thought of giving to uncivilized 
nations, in exchange for the produce of their countries! The natives crowded 
the ship; and Pomare, who was on board, beheld with expressions of contempt the 
poverty of the vessel, and the distress of her crew. In the minds of the 
Missionaries their circumstances awakened compassion, and they readily offered 
to furnish the captain, so far as their means admitted, with such supplies as 
the island afforded, and to assist him in procuring water.<br>
<br>
 The 
Nautilus had touched at the Sandwich Islands, and had brought away some of the 
natives: while the vessel remained, five of these absconded; one was brought 
back, but escaped again. The vessel remained five days at Tahiti, procured such 
supplies as the crew were most in need of, and ultimately sailed, leaving the 
five Sandwich Islanders on shore.<br>
<br>
 Exactly a fortnight after her 
departure, this vessel again entered Matavai Bay, much to the surprise of the 
Missionaries, who were informed by the captain and supercargo, that, in 
consequence of a severe gale off Huahine, she was unfitted for her voyage to 
Massuefero, and that they intended to proceed to Port Jackson, when they had 
increased their supplies. In the course of the night, two seamen absconded with 
the ship's boat; and the next morning the captain and supercargo addressed a 
letter to the Missionaries, acquainting them with the desertion of the men; and 
their determination, in consequence of their deficiency of hands, to recover 
them, cost what it would; soliciting, at the same time, aid in effecting their
&#150; 25 &#150; apprehension. The Missionaries recovered the boat on the 
following day; and, anxious to afford the captain and supercargo of the 
Nautilus every assistance in their power, agreed to use their influence with 
the king, and two of the principal chiefs, to induce them to send the seamen on 
board. Four of the Missionaries went on this errand to the district of Pare, 
where the king and chiefs were residing. After walking between two and three 
hours, they reached the residence of Otu, the young king. The Sandwich 
Islanders were among his attendants, and they had reason to suspect that he had 
favoured the concealment of the seamen.<br>
<br>
 Desirous of disclosing their 
business to the chiefs when together, they remained near the residence of Otu 
some time, expecting the arrival of Pomare, for whom they had sent. The king 
was sullen and taciturn; and, after remaining nearly half an hour expecting 
Pomare, the Missionaries departed, to wait on him personally, at his own 
dwelling.<br>
<br>
 As they passed along, the natives tendered their usual 
salutations, and about thirty accompanied them. They had, however, scarcely 
proceeded a mile on their way, when, on approaching the margin of a river, they 
were each suddenly seized by a number of natives, who stripped them, dragged 
two of them through the river, attempted to drown them, and, after other 
ill-treatment, threatened them with murder. After recovering from the struggle, 
they were in a most pitiable state, deprived of their clothing, and some of 
them severely bruised. Several of the natives now came forward, and expressed 
their pity for the Missionaries, gave them a few strips of cloth, and, at their 
request, &#150; 26 &#150; conducted them to Pomare and Idia, whose tent was at 
some distance. These individuals beheld them with great concern; and, 
expressing no ordinary sympathy in their distress, immediately furnished them 
with native apparel and refreshment; and, when they had rested about an hour, 
accompanied them on their return to Matavai.&#151;When they reached Otu's 
dwelling, Pomare called the king, his son, into the outer court, and questioned 
him as to the treatment the Missionaries had received. He said but little; yet 
there was reason to suppose, that if the assault had not been made by his 
direction, he was privy to it. Bent on the conquest of the whole island, and 
desirous, in conjunction with those attached to his interests, of depriving his 
father and younger brother of all authority in Tahiti, muskets and powder were 
articles in greatest demand, and the aid of Europeans was most earnestly 
desired. The Missionaries, by furnishing supplies to the vessel, had prevented 
his obtaining the former; and in order to be revenged on them for this act of 
friendship to those on board, he had allowed some of his men to follow and to 
plunder them. They had not communicated to him their business, but their having 
applied for the return of the Sandwich Islanders, who had before absconded from 
the vessel, led him to suspect their business on the present occasion. The 
seamen, who had deserted from the Nautilus, were under the protection of the 
king, and appeared among his attendants. The Missionaries did not disclose the 
object of their visit; but Pomare insisted on the deserters being delivered up, 
assuring them they should be carried on board the next day. The seamen 
expressed their determination to remain; and one of&#150; 27 &#150; them said, 
&#147;If they take me on board again, they shall take me on board dead.&#148; 
The conduct of Pomare, the king's father, with that of his queen, Idia, was 
highly commendable; several of the articles of dress, which had been taken from 
the Missionaries, were restored, and the people in general appeared to 
compassionate them; though two of them heard the natives, who were stripping 
them, remark, that, as they had four of them in their possession, they would go 
and take the fourteen remaining at Matavai. In the evening the Missionaries 
arrived at their dwelling, having been furnished by Pomare with a double canoe, 
for their conveyance.<br>
<br>
 The impression this unpleasant occurrence 
produced upon the society at Matavai, was such, that eleven Missionaries, 
including four who were married, judged a removal from the island to be 
necessary; and as the captain and supercargo of the Nautilus offered a passage 
to any who were desirous of returning to Port Jackson, they prepared for their 
departure. Two days after the plunder of the Missionaries, Pomare, anxious to 
remove all apprehension from their mind, sent the chief priest of the island 
with a fowl as an atonement, and a young plantain as a peace-offering, and on 
the following day hastened to their dwelling.<br>
<br>
 The report of the 
departure of the Missionaries soon spread through the island, and appeared to 
be regretted by many of the people. Pomare, who had ever been most friendly, 
manifested unusual sorrow, and used extraordinary efforts to persuade them to 
stay. He went through every room in their house, and every birth on board, and 
addressed each individual by name, with earnest entreaties to remain, and 
assurances of protection.</p> 
<p>&#150; 28 &#150; <i>Noti, eiaha e haere</i>, Mr. Nott, don't go, was his 
language to that individual; and such was also used to others. His evident 
satisfaction was proportionate, when he perceived that Mr. and Mrs. Eyre, and 
five of the single Missionaries, resolved to continue in Tahiti.<br>
<br>
 On 
the 29th of March, those Missionaries who intended to leave, bade their 
companions farewell; and, during the night of the 30th, sailed from Matavai, 
and proceeded to New South Wales. It is worthy of remark, that this event, so 
destructive to the strength of the mission, crippling the efforts of its 
members, and spreading a cloud over their future prospects, resulted not from 
opposition to the efforts of the Missionaries, nor from any dispute between 
them and the priests or people, on subjects connected with the idolatry of the 
latter, but from their benevolent endeavours to serve those, whom purposes of 
commerce had brought to their shores, and whom adverse weather had reduced to 
circumstances of distress&#151;a class of individuals whom the Missionaries, in 
those seas, have ever been ready to succour, but who, with some gratifying 
exceptions, have not always honourably requited that kindness, to which, in 
some instances, they have owed their own preservation.<br>
<br>
 The decision 
of those who left Tahiti, may to some, perhaps, appear premature, but it is not 
easy to form a correct estimate of the dangers to which they were exposed. They 
were well aware of many; but there were others, actually existing, of which 
they were then unconscious. Otu, called Pomare since his father's death, has 
often, during the latter years of his life, told Mr. Nott, that after the 
departure of the Duff, frequently, when he has been carried on men's shoulders 
round the&#150; 29 &#150; residence of the Missionaries, Peter the Swede, who 
has been with him, has said, when the Missionaries were kneeling down in 
prayer, at their morning or evening family worship, &#147;See they are all down 
on their knees, quite defenceless; how easily your people might rush upon them, 
and kill them all, and then their property would be yours.&#148; And it is a 
melancholy fact, that the influence of unprincipled and profligate foreigners 
has been more fatal to the Missionaries, more demoralizing to the natives, more 
inimical to the introduction of Christianity, and more opposed to its 
establishment, than all the prejudices of the people in favour of idolatry, and 
all the attachment of the priests to the interests of their gods.<br>
<br>
 
However much those who remained might have been affected by the departure of so 
many of their companions, they felt no disposition to abandon the field, or 
relax their endeavours for the benefit of the people. Pomare had not only sent 
an atonement and a peace-offering, but, even before the Missionaries sailed, 
had made war upon the district, and had killed two of the men who had been 
engaged in assaulting them. This was, indeed, a matter of regret to the 
Missionaries; but it was also an evidence of his displeasure at the treatment 
they had received. On his assurances of protection, those who remained reposed 
the most entire confidence; which, during his subsequent life, his conduct 
uniformly warranted. Committing their persons to the merciful and watchful 
providence of God, and, under him, to the friendly chiefs who had manifested so 
much concern for their safety; they had sent all the fire-arms, ammunition, and 
other weapons, possessed by the Society, on board the Nautilus, excepting two 
muskets, which they&#150; 30 &#150; presented to Pomare and Idia. To the former 
they gave up their public stores, and all the property they possessed, together 
with the smith's shop, and the tools. They also offered Pomare their private 
property, but he refused to take it; informing them, that so long as they 
remained, every thing in the store-room should be at their command; but that, 
in the event of their leaving the island, he should consider whatever remained 
as his own. On a subsequent occasion, when he feared, that on account of a 
destructive war then prevailing, they might leave, he directed them to take 
their property with them; hereby evincing the most disinterested friendship, 
and a desire to alleviate, rather than profit by, their distresses. Their 
situation was critical, but in a letter which they forwarded on this occasion 
to the Society, they express firm confidence in God, unabated attachment to 
their work, and contentment with such means of support as the country afforded.
<br> <br>
 Not long after the departure of the Nautilus, it was reported, that 
in order to avenge the death of the two men he had killed, the people of Pare 
had declared war against Pomare. He applied to the Missionaries for assistance, 
and, entering the room in which they were assembled, inquired how many of them 
knew how to make war. Mr. Nott replied, &#147;We know nothing of war.&#148; 
Pomare withdrew, and they afterwards agreed not to resort to the use of arms, 
either for offence or defence. Their determination was made known to their 
friends; and, as no dissatisfaction appeared, they were led to hope that they 
should be permitted peaceably to prosecute their labours, without any further 
solicitation on the subject. A native who had assisted in the smith's shop was 
enabled, after&#150; 31 &#150; the departure of the Missionaries, who had used 
the forge, to make fish-hooks, adzes, and a number of useful iron articles; but 
the skill he had acquired, instead of being employed to promote the industry, 
civilization, and comfort of his countrymen, was soon applied to purposes of 
barbarity and murder; and the Missionaries beheld with regret that he was often 
employed, not in manufacturing useful tools, but weapons for battle.<br>
<br>
 
Pomare subsequently made war upon the inhabitants of Pare, where the Europeans 
had been plundered: the people were defeated, fourteen of them killed, and 
forty or fifty of their houses burnt.<br>
<br>
 Five months after the departure 
of the Missionaries in the Nautilus, two large vessels were seen standing 
towards Matavai bay. As soon as they hoisted English colours, the natives were 
thrown into the greatest consternation, and, packing up whatever they could 
carry away, abandoned their houses, and were seen in every direction flying 
towards the mountains. Being asked their reasons for such a proceeding, they 
answered, that seeing two large English ships, they apprehended they were come 
to revenge the assault upon the Missionaries. After many assurances to the 
contrary, their fears seemed to be removed. When the Captains came on shore in 
the evening, they were welcomed by the Missionaries, and introduced to the 
chiefs, whose familiarity and cheerfulness soon evinced that every feeling of 
suspicion had subsided. These vessels were the Cornwall and the Sally of 
London, South Sea whalers. As the ships were in repair, and the crews in 
health, they remained only three days in the harbour, and sailed from the 
island on the 27th of August;&#150; 32 &#150; having made a number of presents 
to the chiefs, they did not leave any of their crews on shore, which was a 
matter of great satisfaction to the Missionaries, who had beheld with regret 
the baneful influence of unprincipled seamen, on the minds and habits of the 
people.<br>
<br>
 From one of these ships, Oripaia, a chief of Papara, and a 
rival of Pomare, had received a large quantity of gunpowder as a present. The 
powder being coarser in the grain than what the natives had been accustomed to 
receive, they imagined either that it was not powder, or that it was a very 
inferior kind. In order to satisfy themselves, Oripaia proposed to one of his 
attendants to try it. A pistol was loaded, and fired over the whole heap of 
powder they had received, and around which the chief and his attendants were 
sitting. A spark fell from the pistol, and the whole of the powder instantly 
exploded. As soon as the natives had recovered from the shock, perceiving the 
powder adhering to their limbs, they attempted to rub it off, but found the 
skin peel off with it; they then plunged into an adjacent river. Six of the 
natives were severely injured, and Oripaia with one of his attendants died. As 
soon as Pomare was acquainted with the accident, he begged Mr. Broomhall to 
visit the house in which the accident had occurred, and endeavour to relieve 
the sufferers. The chief appeared in a most affecting state, dreadfully 
scorched with the powder; Mr. Broomhall employed such applications as he 
supposed likely to alleviate his sufferings; these, however, increased, and 
both the chief and his wife attributed his pains, not to the effects of the 
explosion, but to the remedies applied, or rather to the poison imagined to be 
infused into the application by the&#150; 33 &#150;god of the foreigners. This 
not only aroused the jealousy of the chief, and the rage of Otu, but having 
nearly cost Mr. Broomhall and his companions their lives, it made the 
Missionaries extremely cautious in administering medicine to any of the chiefs. 
Native remedies were now applied, to relieve the sufferings of Oripaia, but 
they were unavailing, and, after languishing for some time in the greatest 
agony, he expired. The body of the deceased chief was embalmed by a process 
peculiar to the inhabitants of the South Sea Islands, and already described. It 
was placed on a kind of platform; and a number of superstitious ceremonies were 
observed. During the performance of these rites, Pomare's orator, and some of 
the inhabitants of Matavai, used insulting expressions in reference to the 
corpse; which so incensed Otu, that, aided by the chief priest, he immediately 
made war upon the district of Matavai. Late in the evening, the Missionaries 
and people had some intimation of his intention: before daylight the next 
morning, the attack was commenced at one end of the district; the inhabitants 
fled before the assailants; and by sunrise, the warriors of Otu had scoured the 
district from one end to the other, driving before them every inhabitant, 
excepting a few in the immediate vicinity of the Missionary dwellings. Several 
warriors, with clubs and spears, surrounded the Missionary house, but its 
inmates remained unmolested; and in the course of the day, Haamanemane arrived, 
and assured the Mission family no evil was designed against them. In the 
evening they were also visited in an amicable manner by Otu and his queen.<br>

<br> In connexion with this attack upon the district of Matavai, which belonged 
to Pomare, Otu and&#150; 34 &#150; Haamanemane declared that Pomare was 
deprived of all authority in the larger peninsula. The districts on the west 
and south side declared for Otu, and those on the western were threatened with 
invasion in the event of refusal. In the division of the territory thus seized, 
the chief priest received the eastern part of Matavai; but he did not long 
enjoy it; he was murdered, at the instance of Pomare, very shortly afterwards.
<br> <br>
 Haamanemane, the old priest, having been Captain Wilson's <i>taio</i>
, or friend, was frequently with the Missionaries, and uniformly kind to them. 
He was evidently a shrewd and enterprising man; yet I should think sometimes 
rather eccentric. When arrayed in a favourite dress, which was a glazed hat, 
and a black coat fringed round the edges with red feathers, his appearance must 
have been somewhat ludicrous, although this was probably his sacerdotal habit, 
as red feathers were always considered emblematical of their deities. He had 
formerly been a principal chief in Raiatea, and still possessed great influence 
over the natives, especially in the adjacent island of Eimeo, where, with a 
little assistance from the European workmen, he had built a schooner, in which 
he came over to see his friend Captain Wilson, during the second visit of the 
Duff to Tahiti. This vessel, considering it as their first effort at 
ship-building, was an astonishing performance. To him, the Missionaries had 
frequent opportunities of speaking, though apparently with but little good 
effect, against many of the sanguinary features of their idolatry, especially 
the offering of human sacrifices, in which they knew he had been more than once 
engaged since their arrival. Sometimes, however,&#150; 35 &#150; he spoke as if 
he officiated, in these horrid rites, more from necessity than choice.<br>
<br>

 He was remarkably active and vigorous, and, though far advanced in years and 
nearly blind, indulged, without restraint, in all the degrading vices of his 
country. Moral character, and virtuous conduct, were never considered 
requisite, even in those whose office was most sacred. As a priest, he 
practised every species of extortion and cruelty; neither was he less familiar 
with intrigue, nor free from ambition, as a politician. His supposed influence 
with the gods, his deep skill in the mysteries of their worship, and the 
constant dread of his displeasure, which would probably have doomed the 
individual, by whom it was incurred, to immolation on the altar of his idol, 
favoured, in no small degree, his assumption and exercise of civil power, both 
in Eimeo and Tahiti. A jealousy appeared to exist between him and Pomare, the 
father of Otu, who was king of the Island; and during the absence of the 
former, on a visit to a neighbouring island, availing himself of the offence 
Pomare's orator and people had given to Otu, he formed a league with the young 
king, to deprive Pomare of all authority in Tahiti. Having offered a human 
victim to his idol, he invaded the district of the absent chieftain, and 
brought war to the very doors of the Mission-house, in less than seventeen 
months after the departure of the Duff. The attack, as already stated, was made 
at daybreak, in the western border of Matavai: four individuals were killed, 
and afterwards offered by the priest to his deity. The inhabitants, unable to 
withstand the young king and his ally, abandoned their plantations and their 
dwellings, and fled for their lives. The invaders&#150; 36 &#150; divided the 
district, and the priest, taking possession of the eastern side, revelled in 
all the profligacy and insolence of plunder and destruction. His triumph, 
however, was but short. Pomare sent privately to Idia directions for his 
assassination. After two or three solicitations from his mother, Otu, the young 
king, though in closest alliance with him, consented to his death, and he was 
murdered by one of Idia's men, at the foot of One-tree Hill, as he was on his 
way to Pare, on the 3d of December 1798, ten days after the invasion of Matavai.
<br> <br>
 This event gave a new aspect to political affairs in the island, and 
appeared to unite in one interest Otu and Pomare his father. The inhabitants of 
Matavai left their places of retreat, and, having presented their 
peace-offering, re-occupied their lands. The Missionaries resumed their 
attempts to instruct the natives, but found the acquisition of the language so 
difficult, and the insensibility of the people so great, that they were 
exceedingly discouraged. Some of the natives, however, were led to inquire how 
it was that Cook, Vancouver, Bligh, and other early visitors, had never told 
them any of those things which they heard from the teachers now residing with 
them.<br>
<br>
 Towards the close of the year 1799, the Missionaries were 
called to the melancholy duty of conveying to the silent grave, under very 
distressing circumstances, Mr. Lewis, one of their number, and the first 
Missionary who had terminated his life on the shores of Tahiti. He landed from 
the ship Duff in 1797, continued to labour with his companions, respected and 
useful, until about three months after the departure of the Nautilus&#150; 37 
&#150; to Port Jackson, when he left the Mission-house, and took up his 
residence with a<i>taio</i>, or friend, in the eastern part of the district. 
Three weeks afterwards, he intimated to his companions his intention of uniting 
in marriage with a native of the island, solemnly purposing to abide faithful 
towards her until death. Considering her an idolatress, the Missionaries deemed 
this an inconsistent and unlawful act, and not only declined to sanction the 
proceeding, but endeavoured by every means to dissuade him from it; but Mr. 
Lewis, persevering in his determination, they dissolved the connexion that had 
subsisted between him and themselves, as members of a Christian church or 
society, and discontinued all religious and social intercourse with him. He was 
still constant in attendance on public worship, industrious in the culture of 
his garden, and in working for the king and principal chiefs, who were 
evidently much attached to him. On the 23d of November, the Missionaries heard 
that he had died on the preceding evening. They hastened to his house, and 
found the corpse lying on a bed; the forehead and face considerably disfigured 
with wounds, apparently inflicted with a stone and a sharp instrument. The 
female with whom he had lived as his wife, informed them that he went out of 
the house on the preceding evening, and that hearing a noise shortly 
afterwards, she hastened to the spot whence it proceeded, and saw him on the 
pavement in front of the house, beating his head against the stones. On looking 
at that part of the pavement where he had fallen, one or two of the stones were 
stained with blood. Some of the natives said that he had acted as if insane; 
others, that the evil spirit had entered into him; but, from several 
expressions that were&#150; 38 &#150; used, there was reason to apprehend he 
had been murdered.<br>
<br>
 Assisted by two or three natives, Mr. Bicknell and 
Mr. Nott dug a grave in a spot near their dwelling on the north side of Matavai 
bay, which had been selected as a place of interment. On the evening of the 
29th of November, 1799, Mr. Nott, Mr. Jefferson, Mr. Eyre, and Mr. Bicknell, 
bore his remains to the grave, where Mr. Harris read the xcth Psalm, and 
offered up an appropriate prayer to Almighty God. The circumstances of his 
death were truly affecting, and the feelings of the Missionaries such as it 
would be in vain to attempt to describe. They have since learned that he was 
murdered; and some of them have also regretted, that, after his separation, 
kindness and friendly intercourse were not continued, which might perhaps, 
without compromise of character, have been consistently maintained. Pomare, 
considering himself the protector of the Missionaries, though he did not appear 
to think he had been murdered, yet proposed, if it appeared to the survivors 
that such had been the fact, to destroy the inhabitants of the district; and so 
much did many of the latter fear such an event, that they fled to the 
mountains. The Missionaries, considering that in such retaliation the innocent 
would suffer with the guilty, interposed, and prevailed upon the king to spare 
the district, but to punish the guilty whenever they might be discovered.<br>

<br> Scarcely were the remains of Mr. Lewis consigned to the silent grave, when 
an event occurred, which again reduced the number of this already weakened 
band. The Betsy of London, a letter of marque, arrived with a Spanish brig her 
prize, &#150; 39 &#150; with which she was proceeding from South America to 
Port Jackson. The commander of the Betsy having intimated his intention of 
returning in five or six months, Mr. Harris proposed to his companions to visit 
New South Wales; and on the 1st of January 1800, he sailed from Matavai bay, 
intending to return when the ship should revisit the islands. By this 
conveyance, the remaining Missionaries wrote an account of their circumstances 
and their prospects to the directors in London, stating, that although they had 
not acquired a sufficient knowledge of the language to enable them publicly to 
preach the gospel, they had observed, whenever they had conversed with the 
natives, that though they could perceive the difference between Christianity 
and paganism, their attachement to the abominations of the latter was too 
strong to be removed by any other influence than that of the Spirit of the Most 
High.<br>
<br>
 Anxious to avoid unnecessary expenditure of those funds which 
British benevolence furnished, they had on a former occasion written, to 
prevent the Society's incurring and further expense on their account, as their 
remaining on the island was uncertain; but now, as there was a prospect of 
peaceable continuance, and the liberal supply they had taken out in the Duff, 
being, by plunder, presents, &amp;c. nearly expended, they found it necessary 
to solicit a few articles for their own use, and others for presents to the 
chiefs, whom they described as daily visiting their dwellings, and treating 
them with kindness.<br>
<br>
 Five days after the departure of the Betsy, the 
Missionaries had the satisfaction to welcome again to their Society, Mr. and 
Mrs. Henry; who returned from Port Jackson in the Eliza, a South&#150; 40 &#150;
 Sea whaler. Mr. Henry was the only one of the number who had left, that 
resumed his labours in Tahiti. By him they also unexpectedly received the 
pleasing intelligence of the Duff's second destination to Tahiti, and were led 
to hope, on her arrival, a reinforcement of labourers, and the various supplies 
of which they stood so much in need. Having repaired the vessel and recruited 
his stores, the captain sailed from Tahiti on the 14th of January, leaving on 
the island three of his seamen, whose influence among the inhabitants in 
general was soon found to be most unfavourable.<br>
<br>
 Hitherto, the public 
worship of God had been performed in one of the apartments of the 
Mission-house, but as it appeared expedient to erect a place for this specific 
object, to which also the natives might have access for the purpose of 
religious instruction, a spot was selected near the grave of Mr. Lewis; and on 
the 5th of March 1797, with the assistance of a number of Pomare's men, they 
commenced the erection of their chapel. The chiefs procured most of the 
materials, and when it was nearly finished, Pomare sent a fish as an offering 
to Jesus Christ, requesting that it might be hung up in their new chapel. This 
was the first building ever erected on the South Sea Islands, for the worship 
of the living God. But although the Missionaries were cheered with the hope of 
often beholding it filled with attentive hearers or Christian worshippers, they 
were obliged to pull it down early in the year 1802, to prevent its affording 
shelter to their enemies, or being set on fire by the rebels, by which their 
own dwelling might have been destroyed.<br>
<br>
 The pleasing anticipations 
which the Missionaries&#150; 41 &#150; had been led to indulge, in connexion 
with the second visit of the Duff, were destroyed by the arrival of the Albion 
in Matavai bay, on the 27th of December in the same year. Her commander, 
Captain Bunker, brought them no letters from England, but conveyed the 
melancholy tidings of the capture of the Duff by a French privateer. He also 
delivered from Mr. Harris, who was settled in Norfolk Island, a letter 
acquainting them with the murder of three of the Missionaries in the Friendly 
Islands, the departure of one, the flight of the rest to Port Jackson, and the 
total destruction of the Tonga Mission. Their own circumstances were by no 
means prosperous: they had heard but once from England; they were expecting 
every day the arrival of the Duff with cheering tidings and additional aid; but 
the intelligence now received, not only disappointed their hopes, but depressed 
their spirits, and darkened their prospects. In the letter sent at this time to 
the directors, they express their anxiety to hear from England, their 
conviction of the facilities that would be afforded towards the establishing 
the gospel in Tahiti and the neighbouring islands, if they were joined by a 
body of Missionaries and an experienced director, and recommended that a 
surgeon and several mechanics should be included in the number of those who 
might be sent.<br>
<br>
 The Albion had scarcely sailed, when large fleets of 
canoes, filled with fighting men, arrived, and the island was agitated with the 
apprehension of hostilities between the king and chiefs. The removal of Oro, 
the national idol, from Pare to Atehuru, was the cause of the threatened 
conflict: ammunition was prepared; a large assembly of chiefs and warriors met 
at Pare; and it was daily&#150; 42 &#150; expected that the long concealed 
elements of war would there explode, and plunge the nation in anarchy and 
bloodshed. At this critical period, his majesty's ship Porpoise arrived in 
Matavai bay. The letter and presents Pomare received by this conveyance from 
the governor of New South Wales, and the attentions paid to him by the 
commander of the vessel, tended, in no small degree, to confirm Otu in his 
government, and to intimidate his enemies.<br>
<br>
 The governors of the 
colony of New South Wales have uniformly manifested the most friendly concern 
for the safety of the Missionaries, and the success of the several Missions in 
the South Seas. On the present occasion, Governor King, in a letter to Pomare, 
remarked, that he could &#147;not too strongly recommend to his kind 
protection, the society of Missionaries whom he had taken under his care;&#148; 
and that, &#147;such protection could not fail to excite the gratitude of the 
Missionaries, and the friendship of King George.&#148; Governor Macquarie, his 
successor, manifested the same kindness towards the Missionaries, and an equal 
regard for the welfare and security of the natives. In order to protect the 
inhabitants of New Zealand and the South Sea Islands from the oppression, 
violence, and murder, of unprincipled and lawless Europeans, he issued, in 
December, 1813, an Order, alike creditable to the enlightened policy of his 
administration, and the benevolence of his heart. A copy was brought to the 
Society Islands, and is here inserted.</p> 
<p><i>Government and General Orders, dated December 1, 1813</i></p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>&#147;No ship or vessel shall clear out from any of the ports within this 
territory, (New South Wales,) for New&#150; 43 &#150; Zealand, or any other 
island in the South Pacific, unless the Master, if of British or Indian, or the 
Master and Owners, if of Plantation registry, shall enter into bonds with the 
Naval Officer, under &pound;1000 penalty, that themselves and crew shall 
properly demean themselves towards the natives; and not commit acts of trespass 
on their gardens, lands, habitations, burial grounds, tombs, or properties, and 
not make war, or at all interfere in their quarrels, or excite any animosities 
among them, but leave them to the free enjoyment of their rites and ceremonies; 
and not take from the islands any male native, without his own and his chief's 
and parents' consent; and shall not take from thence any female native, without 
the like consent&#151;or, in case of shipping any male natives, as mariners, 
divers, &amp;c. then, at their own request at any time, to discharge them, 
first paying them all wages, &amp;c. And, the natives of all the said islands 
being under His Majesty's protection, all acts of rapine, plunder, piracy, 
murders, or other outrages against their persons or property, will, upon 
conviction, be severely punished.&#148;</p> </blockquote> 
<p>In reference to another Order resembling this, and issued November 19, 
1814, it is declared, that&#151;</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>&#147;Any neglect or disobedience of these Orders, will subject the 
offenders to be proceeded against with the utmost rigour of the law, on their 
return thither, (viz. New South Wales;) and, those who shall return to England, 
without first resorting to this place, will be reported to His Majesty's 
Secretary of State for the Colonies, and such documents transmitted, as will 
warrant their being equally proceeded against and punished.&#148;</p> 
</blockquote> 
<p>Although the justice and humanity of the governor of New South Wales were 
so distinctly manifested in the foregoing Orders, these regulations were found 
insufficient to prevent outrage upon the natives, from the masters and crews of 
vessels visiting the islands: an act was therefore passed in the British 
parliament, in the month of June, 1817, entitled, &#147;An Act of the 57th of 
the King,&#150; 44 &#150; for the more effectual punishment of Murders and 
Manslaughters committed in places not within His Majesty's dominions.&#148; As 
it is a document important to the peace and security of the inhabitants of 
Polynesia, I deem no apology necessary, for inserting it nearly entire. In the 
preamble of the bill, it is stated&#151;</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>&#147;That grievous murders and manslaughters had been committed in the 
South Pacific Ocean, as well on the high seas, as on land, in the islands of 
New Zealand and Otaheite, and in other islands, countries, and places, not 
within His Majesty's dominions, by the masters and crews of British ships, and 
other persons, who have, for the most part, deserted from, or left their ships, 
and have continued to live and reside amongst the inhabitants of these islands; 
whereby great violence has been done, and a general scandal and prejudice 
raised against the name and character of British and other European traders: 
And whereas such crimes and offences do escape unpunished, by reason of the 
difficulty of bringing to trial the persons guilty thereof: For remedy whereof, 
be it enacted by the King's most excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and

<p>By the Porpoise, the Missionaries received the agreeable intelligence that 
a ship, with a reinforcement of their number, and necessary supplies from 
England, was on her way to the islands. In the afternoon of the 10th of July, 
1801, the Royal Admiral, commanded by Captain W. Wilson, anchored in the bay, 
having a number of Missionaries on board, together with supplies and letters 
from their friends and the directors, from whom they had heard only once, 
during the four years they had dwelt on the island. Mr. Shelly, one of the 
Missionaries who had been stationed in the Friendly Islands, but had escaped to 
New South Wales, returned to Tahiti in this ship, and was cordially welcomed by 
his friends, along with those who had arrived from England.<br>
<br>
 On the 
13th of July, 1801, Captain Wilson, and the eight Missionaries from England, 
landed near Point Venus, and were introduced to Otu, Pomare, and other 
principal chiefs, by whom they were welcomed to Tahiti. Pomare said he was 
pleased with their arrival, and expressed his willingness that others should 
join them. The gratification he expressed on their landing, however, did not 
arise from any desire after religious instruction, for in this interview he 
spoke of their engaging in war with him, and probably rejoiced in their arrival 
only as a means of increasing the extent of his influence, and the stability of 
his government. After remaining about three weeks at Tahiti, and assisting the 
society in their regulations by his counsel, and in the preparation of their 
houses by the carpenters of the ship,&#150; 46 &#150; Captain Wilson sailed 
from Matavai on the 31st of July. With him, Mr. Broomhall left Tahiti for China 
or India. He had been above five years on the island, having arrived in the 
Duff in 1797. He was an intelligent, active young man, 24 years of age, had 
been highly serviceable to the Mission, and was respected by the natives, until 
about tweleve months prior to the arrival of the Royal Admiral, when he 
intimated his doubts as to the reality of Divine influence on the mind, and the 
immortality of the soul. His companions endeavoured to remove his scepticism; 
but failing in their efforts, he was separated from their communion, having on 
several occasions publicly declared his sentiments to be deistical. He then 
lived some time with a native female, as his wife, but was soon left by her; 
and, on the arrival of Captain Wilson, requested permission to leave the island 
in his ship. His departure from the island under such circumstances, although 
desirable on account of the influence of his principles and conduct on the 
minds of the inhabitants, could not but be peculiarly distressing to those he 
left behind. They followed him with their compassionate regard and their 
prayers, and, after a number of years, learned that he had been engaged in a 
vessel trading in the Indian seas; that he had at length made himself known to 
the Baptist Missionaries at Serampore, from whom they heard that he had 
renounced his erroneous sentiments, and professed his belief in the truth of 
the Christian revelation.<br>
<br>
 The circumstances which follow relative to 
the penitence of this unhappy man, are taken from the &#145;Circular 
Letters&#146; published by the Baptist Missionary Society. In one of these, 
dated Calcutta, May 8, 1809, the writer says&#151;</p> 
<p>&#150; 47 &#150;</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>&#147;We have lately seen the gracious hand of God stretched out in a most 
remarkable manner, in the recovery of a backsliding Missionary, after nine 
years of wandering from God. This person had been chosen with others for an 
arduous undertaking; had been set apart to the great work, and had engaged in 
it to a considerable extent; having acquired a tolerable knowledge of the 
language in which he was to preach to the heathen. At this period, he fell into 
open iniquity; and embraced a gloomy state of infidelity, the frequent 
consequence of backsliding from God.&#148;</p> </blockquote> 
<p>Having left the Mission and gone to sea, several alarming incidents, 
particularly the breaking of a limb at Madras, and a severe illness in 
Calcutta, tended to arouse him to a sense of his danger. But, although he held 
a correspondence with several serious persons, he studiously concealed his 
previous character and his name. At length, after writing a long letter, in 
which he described the anguish of his mind with dreadful minuteness, he 
obtained a private interview with Dr. Marshman and Mr. Ward, of which the 
following is the result.</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>&#147;At the time appointed, he called on brother Marshman, at brother 
Carey's house, and, after a little conversation on the state of his soul, he 
added, &#145;You now behold an apostate Missionary. I am &#151;&#151;, who left 
his brethren nine years ago. Is it possible you can behold me without despising 
me?&#146;&#151;The effect which this discovery of Divine mercy, displayed to a 
backslider, had on brother Marshman's mind, can better be conceived than 
described. It for the moment took away the anguish occasioned by a note that 
instant received from Serampore, saying, that brother Carey was at the point of 
death! Brother Marshman entreated this returning prodigal to be assured of the 
utmost love on our part; encouraged him in his determination to return to his 
Missionary brethren; and promised to intercede on his behalf, both with his 
brethren, and those who sent him out.&#148;</p> </blockquote> 
<p>&#150; 48 &#150;</p> 
<p>Soon after the above interview, Mr. Broomhall embarked on another voyage to 
some port in India, purposing, on his return, to dispose of his vessel, and 
devote the remainder of his days to the advancement of that cause which he had 
abandoned, but from that voyage he never returned: neither Mr. Broomhall nor 
his vessel was ever afterwards heard of,&#151;it is supposed that the vessel 
foundered, and all on board perished.</p>

<br>
 Anxious to increase 
the resources of the islands, those who had arrived in the Royal Admiral had 
brought with them a variety of useful seeds from Port Jackson, with plants of 
the vine, the fig, and the peach-tree, which were planted in the Mission 
garden. Many of the seeds grew, and the vegetables produced added an agreeable 
variety to the indigenous productions of the country. The vine, the peach, and 
the fig, appeared to thrive well; but in the war which broke out shortly after, 
the fences were broken down, the plants torn up or trodden under foot, and the 
garden was entirely destroyed. Pineapples and water melons, of&#150; 50 &#150; 
which the natives seemed remarkably fond, were preserved amidst the general 
devastation. The pineapple grew luxuriantly in several parts of Tahiti; and 
though the natives were told it was palatable food, they were so mistaken in 
the nature of the fruit, that they baked numbers of them in their native ovens, 
before they attempted to eat any undressed. Had they exercised a little more 
patience, the vine also might perhaps have been spared; for it is stated, that 
as soon as the young grapes appeared, they eagerly plucked and tasted them, 
but, finding them exceedingly sour, they became indignant, and, regarding the 
plant as useless, destroyed it.<br>
<br>
 The Missionaries who had arrived in 
the Duff, had now acquired so much of the language as to be able to preach to 
the natives in their own tongue, and to engage in the catechetical instruction 
of the children. In these exercises they did not confine themselves to the 
inhabitants of their own vicinity, but visited the adjacent districts; and, in 
the month of March, 1802, Mr. Nott, accompanied by Mr. Elder, made the first 
Missionary tour of Tahiti. They were in general, hospitably entertained, and 
had many opportunities of speaking to the people, who frequently listened with 
attention, and often made inquiries, either while the preacher was speaking, or 
after the address was ended. They seemed interested in the account of the 
creation, and deeply affected with the exhibition of Jesus Christ, as the true 
atonement for sin; instead of pearls, or pigs, or other offerings, which they 
had been accustomed to consider as the best means of propitiating their 
deities. Some said they desired to pray to the true God, but were afraid the 
gods of Tahiti would&#150; 51 &#150; destroy them if they did: others remarked, 
that the Duff came last among the ships, but that, if the gospel had been 
conveyed by the first ship, the gods of feathers, as they denominated their 
idols, would long ago have been destroyed: and one of the principal chiefs, at 
whose residence they spent the night, observed to the natives around, that he 
believed the Missionaries possessed the true foundation of knowledge.<br>
<br>
 
On their return home, they travelled through the district of Atehuru, and found 
the king, Pomare, and all the chiefs and warriors of the land, assembled at the 
great<i>marae</i>, where a number of ceremonies were performing in honour of 
Oro, the great national idol. As they passed the<i>marae</i>, they saw a number 
of hogs on the altar, and several human sacrifices placed in the trees around; 
and when they reached the spot where the chiefs were assembled, they found 
Pomare offering five or six large pigs to Oro, on board a sacred canoe, in 
which the ark, or residence of the idol, was placed. Notwithstanding his being 
thus engaged, they told him Jehovah alone was God, that pigs were not 
acceptable to him as offerings, that Jesus Christ was the true atonement for 
sin, and that God was offended with them for killing men. The chief at first 
seemed unwilling to listen, but at last said he would attend to their religion.
<br> <br>
 On the following day, when the king, chiefs, and people, were 
assembled within the temple, Otu and his father, pretending to have received 
intimation that Oro wished to be conveyed to Tautira, in Taiarabu, Pomare 
addressed the chiefs of Atehuru, requesting them to give him up; but the 
orators of the Atehuruan chiefs resisted.</p> 
<p>&#150; 52 &#150;</p> 
<p>Otu then demanded him, but the chiefs still refused compliance. Pomare then 
recommended his son, the king, to allow the Atehuruan chiefs to retain the idol 
until a certain ceremony had been performed. This the king declined, and again 
insisted that Oro should be given up. This was still refused; and, having asked 
for some time without effect, he rose in anger, and ordered his party to 
withdraw. A number of his attendants rushed upon the canoes, other seized the 
god by force, tore him away from the people of Atehuru, and bore him towards 
the sea. This was not only the signal for war, but the commencement of 
hostilities. The Atehuruans fled to the valley, and the king and Pomare set 
sail with their fleet to the place of rendezvous; and, lest Oro should feel 
indignant at the treatment he had received, a human sacrifice was ordered; but 
as they had no captives with them, one of Pomare's own servants was murdered, 
and offered, as soon as the king reached the shore. The next morning, the fleet 
sailed with the idol for Tautira, and the Missionaries returned to their 
companions, with the tidings of the threatening events, of which they had been 
the melancholy spectators. When the fleet reached Papara, Pomare sent them word 
that it was probable the Atehuruans would attack them, and advised them to be 
upon their guard. Ten days after, they heard that the inhabitants of Atehuru 
had invaded the district of Faa, murdered those who had not escaped by flight, 
burnt the houses, and continued their murderous and desolating course into the 
district of Pare, which joins Matavai on the south. Here they drove out the 
inhabitants, burnt their habitations, and then returned to their own territory; 
not, however,&#150; 53 &#150; without threatening to enter the district of 
Matavai, and assault and plunder the Missionaries.<br>
<br>
 This rebellion, 
called in the annals of Tahiti, Te tamai ia Rua, The war of Rua, (Rua being the 
name of the principal leader of the rebellion,) was the most powerful and 
alarming that had yet taken place; and the circumstances by which God 
providentially preserved the Missionaries from its rage, and from inevitable 
ruin, were remarkable. About six weeks before Mr. Nott commenced his tour of 
Tahiti, the Norfolk, an armed brig from Port Jackson, arrived at Matavai, and 
brought Mr. and Mrs. Shelly to join the Mission. About a week after the arrival 
of the Norfolk, the Venus, another colonial vessel, came into the bay, and left 
on shore Captain Bishop and six seamen, to purchase pigs and salt pork for Port 
Jackson, while Captain Bass pursued his voyage to the Sandwich Islands, on the 
same errand. About the 30th of March the Norfolk was wrecked in Matavai bay, 
having been driven on shore by a heavy gale of wind. The hull was destroyed, 
but all the stores were preserved. Seventeen Englishmen were thus cast ashore, 
and added to the number of those already residing there. These, together with 
Captain Bishop and his men, exposed to one common enemy, united with the 
Missionaries for mutual defence; and to them, under God, the Missionaries owed 
their preservation. Two or three hundred warriors came from Eimeo to Pomare's 
aid. They encamped in the northern part of Pare, where they were joined by a 
number of the inhabitants of those districts, favourable to his cause; but they 
were attacked, and driven in confusion before the rebels towards Matavai, which 
had now become the frontier district.</p> 
<p>&#150; 54 &#150;</p> 
<p>On the day of the engagement, Captain Bishop, with a strong party, occupied 
the pass on the top of One-tree Hill, arrested the progress of the victors, and 
favoured the retreat of the vanquished, whose courage appeared to have forsaken 
them, under the conviction that the god Oro, fighting with their enemies, 
rendered them invincible. The rebels did not attempt to enter the district, but 
sent a messenger with proposals of alliance, offering the English the 
government of Matavai, and the two districts to the southward, which they had 
already ravaged. If this was not agreed to, they demanded permission to march 
through the district to attack their enemies beyond Matavai, and, in the event 
of refusal, declared their intention of forcing a passage with the club and the 
spear. The refugees from the conquered districts had already sheltered 
themselves under the protection of the Missionaries and their companions, and 
they would have fallen a sacrifice to the cruelty of their enemies, had these 
been allowed to pass through the district. The English, therefore, acceded to 
the first proposition. The Atehuruans ratified the treaty, returned to their 
own land, and thus afforded the foreigners at Matavai, and those under their 
protection, a short respite from the dread of immediate attack. Had the 
Missionaries been the only Englishmen residing on the island at the time, it is 
most probable the victors would not have been checked by them in their career 
of conquest. They would have prosecuted their march of destruction; and, as the 
Missionaries remark, they must have retreated, or fallen a sacrifice to their 
fury.<br>
<br>
 Flushed with success, and animated with the belief that the god 
fought with them, the rebels,&#150; 55 &#150; having offered in sacrifice the 
bodies of the slain, and united in their confederacy the districts of Papara, 
and the whole of the south-west side of the larger peninsula, crossed the 
isthmus, marched at once to Tautira, and attacked the king and Pomare; who, 
ever since their arrival with the idol they had seized in Atehuru, had been 
engaged in offering human sacrificed, and by other acts of worship, 
propitiating the favour of Oro. The rebels conducted their expedition with so 
much secrecy and despatch, that the king was taken by surprise. Notwithstanding 
this, the assailants were, in their first onset, repulsed; but, renewing their 
attack in the night, although; Pomare's party had forty muskets, and those in 
the hands of the rebels were not more than fourteen, they threw the king's 
forces into confusion, killed a chief of influence, a near relative of 
Pomare's, and, driving his warriors to their canoes, retook the object of their 
murderous contention, the image of Oro, and remained masters of the whole of 
Tairabu, as well as of the south and western side of the large peninsula.<br>

<br> Pomare, with his vanquished forces, pursued their voyage to Matavai, where 
he and his son were received with respect by Captain Bishop and his companions. 
His affairs appeared desperate, and he entertained no thoughts of security, but 
by flight to Eimeo. When, however, he beheld the manner in which the English 
had prepared to defend themselves, if attacked; and was assured by Captain 
Bishop and his companions, that if he was conquered, they were not; and that 
they would support him in the present critical state of the nation, and assist 
in the restoration of his government, his prospects brightened, and he again
&#150; 56 &#150;indulged a hope that his affairs might be retrieved.<br>
<br>
 
The rebels were now masters of the greater part of the island; and, as the 
Missionaries had every reason to believe they would attempt the conquest of the 
remainder, and knew that their establishment was the only point where they were 
likely to meet with the slightest resistance, they neglected no means of 
defence. The Mission-house was converted into a garrison. The enclosures of the 
garden were destroyed, the bread-fruit and cocoanut trees cut down, to prevent 
their affording shelter to the enemy, and the means of annoyance from their 
muskets or their slings. Their chapel was also pulled down, lest the enemy 
should occupy it or burn it, and from it set fire to their own dwelling. A 
strong paling, or stockade, was planted round the house; boards, covered with 
nails, were sunk in the paths leading to it; and thither the Missionaries, 
Captain Bishop, Captain House, commander of the vessel that had been wrecked, 
and the seamen under their orders, now retired, as they daily received the most 
alarming accounts of the intention of the rebels to make their next attack upon 
them. The veranda in front of their dwelling was protected by chests, bedding, 
and other articles, so as to afford a secure defence from musket-balls; and the 
sides of the house, which were only boarded, were fortified with similar 
materials. Four brass cannon, which had been saved from the wreck of the 
Norfolk, were fixed in two of the upper rooms, and the inmates of the dwelling 
were placed under arms, as far as the number of muskets would admit. The 
Missionaries, as well as the seamen, stood sentinels in turn, night and day, in 
order to prevent surprise.</p> 
<p>&#150; 57 &#150;</p> 
<p>Their situation at this time must have been most distressing. Independently 
of the desolation that surrounded them, and the confusion and disquietude that 
must necessarily have attended their being all confined in one house, together 
with the two captains and their seamen, they were daily expecting an attack. 
Sometimes they heard that the rebels were entering Matavai from the east, at 
other times from the west, and sometimes they received intelligence that they 
had divided their forces, and intended to commence the attack from two opposite 
points at the same time.<br>
<br>
 Pomare erected some works on One-tree Hill, 
to arrest their progress, should they attempt the district in that direction; 
and, hearing they were still ravaging the peninsula of Tairabu, sent a strong 
party to<i>tabu-te ohua</i>, strike their encampment at home. His party reached 
Atehuru, without molestation, late at night; and, after a short concealment, 
falling upon the unconscious and defenceless victims, under the cover of the 
darkness of midnight, in two hours destroyed nearly two hundred men, women, and 
children. The men who remained at home, in times of war, were generally either 
aged or sick, and incapable of bearing arms. This unprovoked act of cruelty, on 
the part of Pomare, heightened to such a degree the rage of the rebels, that 
they vowed the entire destruction of the reigning family.<br>
<br>
 While the 
affairs of the island remained in this unsettled state, the Nautilus arrived, 
and Pomare prevailing on the captain to furnish him with a boat manned by 
British seamen armed, went to Atehuru to present a costly offering to Oro, 
whose favour he still considered to be the only means of restoring his 
authority. Although that idol was now in&#150; 58 &#150; the hands of his 
enemies, yet, as his errand was of a sacred character, the Atehuruans, 
notwithstanding they would not admit him to the temple, allowed him to present 
his offerings, which he deposited on a part of the beach near the temple, and 
peaceably retired.<br>
<br>
 When Pomare returned, he solicited from the 
captains, men and arms to go against the insurgents; and on the 3d of July, 
Captain Bishop and the mate of the Nautilus, with twenty-three Europeans, well 
supplied with ammunition, arms, and a four-pound cannon, accompanied Pomare's 
forces to the attack. All the Missionaries remained at Matavai, excepting one, 
who accompanied Captain Bishop as surgeon. On reaching Atehuru, they found the 
rebels had taken refuge in their Pare or natural fortress, about four miles and 
a half from the beach. This retreat was rendered by nature almost impregnable 
to the native warriors, and the only avenues leading to it being defended by 
the barriers its occupants had thrown up, it appeared difficult, if not 
impossible, to take it by storm, even with the foreign aid by which the king 
was supported. After spending the day in almost harmless firing at the enemy, 
the English and the natives were on the point of embarking to return, when the 
rebels having been decoyed from their encampment by the daring and challenges 
of an active and courageous young man, who had assumed the name of To-morrow 
Morning, chased him and his companions down to the sea-side. Here they were 
checked by Pomare's musketeers, and retreated a few moments, when they halted, 
and faced their pursuers; but on the arrival of the English, they were seized 
with a panic, and fled. Seventeen of the rebel warriors, including Rua, one of 
their leaders, were taken, and killed on the&#150; 59 &#150; spot by Pomare; 
whose followers, according to their savage rules of war, treated their bodies 
with the most wanton brutality.<br>
<br>
 Pomare and his English allies marched 
the next morning to the strong-hold of the natives, and were much disappointed 
at finding it filled with men determined to defend it to the last. A female was 
sent, as a herald, with a flag of truce to the warriors in the fortress, 
informing them of the number slain, and proposing to them the king's terms of 
peace. Taatahee, the remaining chief of the rebels, who was related to Pomare, 
directed her to tell him, that when they had done to him, as they had done to 
Rua the slain chief, then, and not till then, there would be peace. As it 
appeared improbable that the place could be attacked with advantage to the 
assailants, and equally improbable that its occupants would accept any terms of 
capitulation that the king would offer, Captain Bishop returned to Matavai, and 
on the day following Pomare sailed about twelve miles towards Pare. Here he 
fixed his encampment; and, although peace was not concluded, hostilities appear 
to have been for some time suspended.<br>
<br>
 Soon after the return of 
Captain Bishop, the Nautilus sailed; and the Venus having revisited Tahiti, on 
the 19th of the following month Capt. Bishop with his men left the island.<br>

<br> Dreadful and alarming as these superstitious and bloody contests had been, 
and though still exposed to the horrors of savage war, the Missionaries, 
protected in their work by the care of Providence, felt that they were</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>&#147;&#133;&#133; devote to God and truth, <br>
 And sworn to man's 
eternal weal, beyond<br>
 Repentance sworn, or thought of turning back,&#148;
</p> </blockquote> 
<p>&#150; 60 &#150; and determined, in dependence on Divine protection and 
support, to maintain their station; diligently to labour, and patiently to wait 
for the reward of their toil. They beheld, with deepest distress, their gardens 
destroyed, their trees cut down, the fences they had reared with so much care 
demolished, the country around a desolate wilderness, and the inhabitants 
reduced to a state of destitution and wretchedness; yet they could not 
contemplate the remarkable interposition of Providence, in affording them the 
means of perfect security amidst the surrounding destruction, without mingled 
emotions of admiration and gratitude.<br>
<br>
 The cessation of hostilities 
afforded the Missionaries a respite from anxious watching, and allowed them to 
pursue their former avocations. Their gardens were again enclosed, and such 
seeds as they had preserved were committed to the ground. The study of the 
language, which, under the guidance and assistance of Mr. Nott, had been 
regularly pursued one or two evenings every week, was resumed. In the 
instruction of the children, the greatest difficulties had been experienced 
from their restless and unrestrained dispositions and habits; for, having been 
unaccustomed to any steady application, or to the least control, they seldom 
attended to their lessons long enough to derive any advantage from the efforts 
of their teachers; yet, as opportunity offered, the Missionaries continued to 
catechize them, and to preach to the adults. The natives, however, persevered 
in their depredations on the little remaining property of the mission; and, in 
order to deter others, one of them, who had been detected, was publicly flogged 
by the king's order.<br>
<br>
 Towards the close of the year 1802, Mr. Jefferson
&#150; 61 &#150; and Mr. Scott made the tour of Tahiti, for the purpose of 
preaching to the people. In most of the places they were hospitably 
entertained, though, on one occasion, the chief refused them lodging, because a 
former Missionary had not rewarded him for his accommodations. In some 
instances, the natives appeared to listen with attention and interest to their 
message, but they frequently found great difficulty in inducing them to attend, 
and often observed with pain, that their instructions were received with 
indifference or with ridicule. At on place, though the people on their first 
arrival welcomed them cordially, yet when they understood the object of their 
visit, a marked, and by no means pleasing change, appeared in their behaviour.
<br> <br>
 For many years, the first Missionaries were variously annoyed in 
almost all their attempts to preach the gospel. Sometimes, when they had gone 
to every house in a village, and the people promising to attend, had left their 
houses, they often found, on reaching the appointed place, that only two or 
three had arrived there; at other times, they either talked all the while about 
their dress, complexion, or features, and endeavoured to irritate the 
foreigners by false insinuations as to the objects of their visit; or to excite 
the mirth of their own companions by ludicrous gestures, or low witticisms on 
the statements that were made. Brainard remarks, that while he was preaching, 
the Indians sometimes played with his dog: but the first teachers in Tahiti 
were often disturbed by a number of natives bringing their dogs, and setting 
them to fight on the outside of the circle they were addressing; or they would 
bring their fighting-cocks, and set them at each other, so as completely&#150; 
62 &#150; to divert the audience, who would at once turn with a vidity from the 
Missionary, to the birds or the dogs. On some occasions, while they have been 
preaching, a number of Areois, or strolling players, passing by, have commenced 
their pantomime or their dance, and drawn away every one of the hearers. At 
such times, those who had stood round the Missionary only to insult him by 
their insinuations, ridicule him by their vulgar wit, or afflict his mind by 
their death-like indifference to the important truths he had declared, have 
instantly formed a ring around the Areois, and gazed on their exhibitions of 
folly and of vice with interest and pleasure.<br>
<br>
 In addition to these 
sources of disturbance, they were sometimes charged with being the authors of 
all the disasters and suffering of the people, in consequence of praying to 
their God, whom the natives called a bad God when compared with Oro. Under 
these circumstances, it required no small degree of forbearance and 
self-possession, as well as patient toil, to persevere in preaching the gospel 
among a people whose spirit and conduct afforded so little encouragement to 
hope it would ver be by them received.<br>
<br>
 Hitherto their labours had 
been confined to Tahiti; but in December, 1802, Mr. Bicknell, accompanied by 
Mr. Wilson, made a voyage to Eimeo, and, travelling round it, preached 
&#147;the unsearchable riches of Christ&#148; to its inhabitants, many of whom 
appeared to listen with earnestness, and desired to be more fully instructed.
<br> <br>
 The same year, in the month of November, Teu, an aged and respected 
chief, the father of Pomare, and the grandfather of the king, died at his 
habitation not far from the Mission-house.</p> 
<p>&#150; 63 &#150;</p> 
<p>He was remarkably venerable in his appearance, being tall and well made, 
his countenance open and mild, his forehead high, his hair blanched with age, 
and his beard as white as silver, hanging down upon his breast.32 He had led a 
quiet and peaceful life ever since the commencement of the Mission, was 
probably the oldest man in the island, and, what is rather unusual, died 
apparently from the exhaustion of nature, or old age. He was esteemed by the 
natives, and supposed to be a favourite with the gods. But whenever the 
Missionaries had endeavoured to pour into his benighted mind the light of 
truth, as revealed in the sacred volume, it was a circumstance deeply regretted 
by them, that he had generally manifested indifference or insensibility.<br>

<br> The family at Matavai were exposed to trials not only from the evils of 
war, and the opposition of the heathen to their instructions, but also from the 
false reports which were circulated against them. An instance of this occurred 
early in the following year, 1803, when the Unicorn, a London ship, arrived, on 
her return from the north-west coast of America. Otu, the king, suddenly left 
Matavai, and repaired to his dwelling in Pare, incensed against some of the 
Missionaries, who, he was informed, had been endeavouring to prejudice the 
captain against him, that he might not receive any presents, and had actually 
prevented the captain from giving the natives the price they had asked for 
their pigs. This report was most unfounded, and it was hoped the effects were 
soon removed.</p> 
<p>&#150; 64 &#150;</p> 
<p>About this time the Margaret, in which Captain Byers and Mr. Turnbull had 
visited the islands for purposes of commerce, was wrecked on a reef about 200 
miles distant; Mr. Turnbull had remained in Tahiti; Captain Byers, his 
officers, and crew, consisting of sixteen individuals, with the mate's wife and 
child, safely reached that island in a long kind of chest, or boat, which they 
had built with the fragments of the wreck.<br>
<br>
 Towards the close of the 
last year, Otu's brother Teariinavahoroa, the young prince of Tairabu, removed 
from the smaller peninsula in consequence of the increase of his disorder, 
which appeared to be consumption. Pomare, his mother, Idia, his brother and 
sister, and the chiefs, paid him every attention; human sacrifices were 
offered; and both Pomare and Otu frequently invoked their gods in his favour, 
and presented the most costly offerings. For a number of days no fires were 
allowed to be lighted, in order that these might be effectual: but all were 
unavailing; the young chief, who had scarcely arrived at the age of manhood, 
died in the district of Pare on the 19th of June, 1803. The Missionaries 
frequently visited him after his arrival in Pare, and, as far as their scanty 
means would allow, administered cordials suited to his languid state. They 
were, however, most anxious to direct his mind to the great Physician of souls, 
and to lead him to apply for those remedies that would heal his spiritual 
maladies, and prepare him for his approaching dissolution. On this subject, 
they noticed with distress not only the unwillingness of his friends that any 
thing should be said, but also the insensibility of the young chieftain 
himself. It was supposed by the people, that his illness and death&#150; 65 
&#150; were occasioned by the incantations of Metia, a priest of Oro, a famous 
wrestler and sorcerer, whose influence, ceremonies, and prayers, had induced 
the evil spirits to enter into the young prince, and destroy him. 
Counter-ceremonies were performed; prayers, called<i>faatere</i>, were offered, 
to drive the evil spirits from him, and these, it was imagined, would all be 
unavailing, should the Europeans direct his mind to any other source, or offer 
on his behalf prayers to any other god, and hence in part might have proceeded 
the aversion of his friends to the presence and efforts of the Missionaries.<br>
<br> Another large meeting of chiefs, priests, and warriors, was held during 
the summer of 1803 at Atehuru, and rumours of war were again spread through the 
land. Here Otu once more demanded the body or image or the great god Oro, which 
the chiefs agreed ultimately to give up to the custody of the king, but which 
they were not so ready at once to surrender.<br>
<br>
 The state of the people 
was at this time most affecting. Diseases, introduced by Europeans, were 
spreading, unmitigated, their destructive ravages, and some members of almost 
every family were languishing under the influence of foreign maladies, or dying 
in the midst of their days. The survivors, jealous of the Missionaries, viewed 
them as the murderers of their countrymen, under the supposition that these 
multiplied evils were brought upon them by the influence of the foreigners with 
their God. They did not scruple to tell them that He was killing the people; 
but that by and by, when Oro gained the ascendancy, they should feel the 
effects of his vengeance. In addition to the diseases resulting from their 
immorality, &#150; 66 &#150; <br>
 there were others of a contagious and often 
fatal character, to which the natives were formerly strangers. These, whether 
they had been conveyed to the islands by the visits of ships, or the desertion 
of seamen afflicted with them, produced the most distressing sickness and 
mortality among the people; and, although nothing could be more absurdly 
imagined, yet, according to their ideas of the causes of disease and death, 
that they originated in the displeasure of some offended deity, or were 
inflicted in answer to the prayers of some malignant enemy, they were, from the 
representations of some, and the conjectures of others, led to suppose that 
these diseases were sent by the God of the Missionaries, in answer to their 
prayers, and because they would not reject Oro, and join in their worship.<br>

<br> At this time an event transpired, which threatened at first a revival of 
all the confusion and desolation of war. This was the demise of Pomare, the 
father of Otu the king. His death was sudden; he had taken his dinner, and was 
proceeding with two of his attendants in a single canoe towards the Dart, a 
vessel on the point of sailing from the bay. While advancing towards the ship, 
he felt a pain in his back, which occasioned him involuntarily to start in his 
seat; and, placing his hand on the part affected, he fell forward in the canoe, 
and instantly expired. The suddenness and circumstances of his death, taken in 
connexion with the troubles in which he had recently been engaged with the 
greater part of the people of the island, on account of his violent seizure of 
the idol of Atehuru, strengthened in no small degree the idolatrous veneration 
with which the natives regarded their god; and the anger of &#150; 67 &#150; 
Oro was by them supposed to be the direct cause of Pomare's death.<br>
<br>
 In 
person, Pomare, like most of the chiefs of the South Sea Islands, was tall and 
stout; in stature he was six feet four inches high, his limbs active and 
well-proportioned, his whole from and gait imposing. He was often seen at 
Matavai, walking with firm steady step, and using with ease as a walking-stick 
a club of polished ironwood, that would have been almost sufficient for an 
ordinary native to have carried. His countenance was open and prepossessing, 
his conversation affable, though his manner was grave and dignified. He was 
originally only a chief of the district of Pare, but his natural enterprise and 
ambition, together with the attention shewn him by the commanders of British 
vessels, their presents of fire-arms and ammunition, and the aid of European 
seamen, especially the mutineers of the Bounty, had enabled him to assume and 
maintain the supreme authority in Tahiti. Though not possessed of the greatest 
personal courage, he was a good politician, and a man of unusual activity and 
perseverance. He laboured diligently to multiply the resources of the island, 
and improve the condition of the people, and his adherents were always well 
furnished with all that the island afforded. The uncultivated sides of the 
mountains, and the low flat sandy parts of the shore, seldom tilled by the 
natives, were reclaimed by his industry; and many extensive groves of cocoa-nut 
trees in Tahiti and Eimeo, which the inhabitants say were planted by Pomare, 
remain as monuments of his patriotism, and yield no small emolument to their 
present proprietors. In all these labours he endeavoured to infuse his own 
spirit into the bosom of his followers,&#150; 68 &#150; and to animate them by 
his example, usually labouring with his people, and planting with his own hands 
many of the trees.<br>
<br>
 To the mission families he was uniformly kind. 
Shortly before his death, he recommended them to the protection of his son; 
though the more he understood the chief object of their pursuit, the greater 
aversion he seemed to manifest to it. To the favour of the gods he considered 
himself indebted for the aggrandisement of his person and family; and if the 
Missionaries would have allowed the claims of Oro or Tane to have received an 
equal degree of attention to that which they required for Jehovah, or Jesus 
Christ, Pomare would readily have admitted them; but when required to renounce 
his dependence upon the idols of his ancestors, and to acknowledge Jehovah 
alone as the true God, he at once rejected their message. He was justly 
considered as the principal support of the idolatry of his country. In 
patronizing the idols, and adhering to all the requirements of the priests, 
&amp;c. he appears to have been influenced by the constant apprehension of the 
anger of his gods. Teu, his father, was a Tahitian prince; his mother was a 
native of Raiatea; he was born in the district of Pare; and at the time of his 
death, which took place on the 3d of September, 1803, was between fifty and 
sixty years of age.<br>
<br>
 In the circumstances attending the formation of 
his character, and in the commencement, progress, and result of his public 
career, there was a striking resemblance between Pomare, the first king of that 
name in Tahiti, and his contemporary, Tamehameha, the first king of the 
Sandwich Islands. Both rose from a comparatively humble station in society, to 
the supreme authority; both owed their&#150; 69 &#150; elevation principally to 
their own energies, and the aid they derived from their intercourse with 
foreigners; both appeared the main pillars of the idolatry of their respective 
countries; and both left to their heirs the undisputed government of the 
islands they had conquered. Each appeared to have possessed natural endowments 
of a high order, and both were probably influenced by ambition. Pomare was 
distiguished by laborious and patient perseverance; Tamehameha, by bold and 
daring enterprise. The characters of their immediate descendants were in some 
respects similar to each other, though both were very different persons from 
their respective predecessors.<br>
<br>
 Otu the king was at Atehuru at the 
time of his father's death. He sent several messengers to Pare, commanding the 
body to be brought to him; but to this the<i>raatiras</i>, or resident chiefs, 
objected. When the Missionaries paid a visit of condolence, Idia requested them 
to tell her son it was her wish that the body should remain at Pare; and to 
this the king consented.<br>
<br>
 The death of Pomare did not alter the 
political state of Tahiti; its only influence on the people was such as tended 
to confirm them in their superstition; for, on the occasion of a religious 
ceremony, wherein his spirit was invoked, and which took place shortly after 
his decease, it was declared that he was seen by Idia, and one of the priests. 
To the latter it was said he appeared, above the waters of the sea, having the 
upper part of his person bound with many folds of finely braided cinet. From 
this circumstance his favourite wife assumed the name of Tane rurua, from Tane, 
a husband, and rurua, bound round, or bound repeatedly.</p> 
<p>&#150; 70 &#150; Towards the middle of the year 1804, the king went over to 
Eimeo, talking with him the great idol Oro, to propitiate whom, so many of the 
inhabitants had been sacrificed. About the same time, Mr. Caw, a shipwright 
from England, joined the mission. Otu now assumed the name of Pomare, which has 
ever since been the regal name in Tahiti. Its assumption by his father was, as 
many names are among the Tahitians, perfectly accidental. He was travelling, 
with a number of his followers, in a mountainous part of Tahiti, where it was 
necessary to spend the night in a temporary encampment. The chiefs' tent was 
pitched in an exposed situation; a heavy dew fell among the mountains; he took 
cold, and the next morning was affected with a cough; this led some of his 
companions to designate the preceding night by the appellation of<i>po-mare</i>
, night of cough, from<i>po</i>, night, and <i>mare</i>, cough. The chief was 
pleased with the sound of the words thus associated, adopted them as his name, 
and was ever afterwards called Po-ma-re. With the name he also associated the 
title of majesty, styling himself, and receiving the appellation of, &#147;His 
Majesty Pomare.&#148;<br>
<br>
 Peace continued during the remainder of the 
year, and the Missionaries were enabled to persevere in their labours, although 
they were cheerless, and apparently useless. Great attention had, during the 
last year, been paid to the instruction of the children in the short catechism, 
in which the first principles of Christianity were familiarly exhibited to the 
minds of the young people. Mr. Davies, in particular, had devoted much of his 
time to this work; and although it had hitherto been found impracticable to 
teach the children letters, a number had committed the&#150; 71 &#150; 
catechism to memory. The gospel was preached, not only in the immediate 
neighbourhood of Matavai, but in every district in Tahiti and Eimeo; yet the 
people seemed more than ever disposed to neglect or ridicule it. Sometimes they 
said, We will hear our own gods; at other times they scoffingly asked the 
Missionaries, if the people of Matavai had attended to their word; if the king, 
or any of his family, had cast away Oro; declaring, that when the king and 
chiefs heard the word of Jehovah, then they would also.<br>
<br>
 Early in 
January, 1805, the Missionaries prepared a larger catechism; and, on the 6th of 
March, they adopted their Tahitian alphabet. In forming this, the Roman 
characters were preferred; sounds in the Tahitian language attached to them; 
and, for the purpose of facilitating the introduction of letters among the 
people, a native name was affixed to each. It was, however, a long time before 
any, among the native inhabitants of Tahiti could be induced to learn the 
letters of the alphabet; yet the Missionaries continued their labours in 
preaching to the people, and teaching the catechism to the children. One or two 
vessels arrived, but brought no letters or supplies; and, towards the close of 
the year, they experienced a heavy loss, in the destruction of a large and 
flourishing plantation.<br>
<br>
 Three of the Missionaries had cleared, 
enclosed, and cultivated it; and had rendered it, as far as the productions of 
the island were available, subservient to their interests. They had stocked it 
with cocoa-nuts, oranges, limes, and citrons, of which, not fewer than six 
hundred plants, with other productions, were growing remarkably well. In one 
hour, however, the whole of the fence was&#150; 72 &#150; burnt to the ground, 
and the plantation destroyed, or the few plants that remained were so much 
injured as to be nearly useless. Great as was the loss experienced on this 
occasion, they had reason to fear it was caused by some of their neighbours, 
who had designedly set fire to the long dry grass immediately to windward of 
the plantation. This was probably done from motives of jealousy, lest, by 
cultivating the land, and reaping the fruits of it, the foreigners should 
suppose it had become theirs, and the natives cease to be its proprietors. On 
this account, much as they suffered by its destruction, they deemed it 
inexpedient to complain to the king.<br>
<br>
 In the month of January, 1806, 
Pomare returned from Eimeo, bringing with him the idol Oro, which was kept in 
his sacred canoe; while the human sacrifices, offered on his arrival, were 
suspended on the trees around. The Missionaries paid a visit to the king, soon 
after his return; and, as he had become remarkably fond of using his pen, he 
intimated his wish that they should build him a small plastered house, near 
their own, in which he could attend to his writing without the interruptions he 
experienced in his own dwelling.<br>
<br>
 Early in the year 1806, the Mission 
was again weakened by the departure of Mr. Shelly, with his family. He 
relinquished Missionary pursuits, and sailed for Port Jackson on the ninth of 
March.<br>
<br>
 In the month of July, following, the queen of Tahiti died, in 
the district of Pare, after an illness of nearly eight weeks. About the time 
that her indisposition commenced, she had become the mother of a still-born 
child; the sickness that followed, and the fatal termination to which it led,
&#150; 73 &#150; were supposed to be the results of a cruel and unnatural 
practice, that cannot be described&#151;a species of infanticide, often 
resorted to by females of high rank in the island, although not unfrequently 
issuing, as was imagined on the present occasion, in the death of the 
perpetrator. Pomare had offered his prayers to the gods of his family, and many 
ceremonies had been performed, but to no purpose. The queen was in person about 
the middle stature; mild and affable in her behaviour; addicted to all the 
vices of her country; and was cut off in the prime of life, being about 
twenty-four years of age at the time of her death. The king and his mother 
appeared affected with their loss; and the grief of his relatives was severe, 
as the death of so many members of Pomare's family threatened, at no very 
remote period, its total extinction. Pomare was left a widower and childless, 
all the children of the late queen having been destroyed.<br>
<br>
 Although 
reports of war were heard during the year, there was no actual hostility; and, 
under discouragements every day increasing, the Missionaries were enabled to 
prosecute their labours, Having found it difficult to engage the attention of 
the children, while attempting to teach them in the presence of the adults, who 
ridiculed the idea of their learning letters, they opened a school in a part of 
their own dwelling. In October, Mr. Davies proposed to begin with the boys 
attached to their own houses, and met them three nights in the week for the 
purpose of instructing them in the catechism, and teaching them to read those 
few specimens of writing they had been able to prepare. At the same time, 
Messrs. Nott and Davies were requested to draw up a brief summary of the&#150; 
74 &#150;leading events, and a short account of the principal persons mentioned 
in the Old Testament, in the form of a scripture history, for the use of these 
scholars. In the course of the following year, a spelling-book, which Mr. 
Davies had composed and used, was sent to England. Here it was printed, and 
afterwards transmitted to the islands, for the use of the schools.<br>
<br>
 No 
long period had elapsed since the first establishment of the Mission, without a 
vessel's touching at Tahiti. By many of these the Missionaries had been able to 
write to the directors and to their friends in England, and from several they 
had secured a small supply of such articles as they most needed. But since the 
arrival of the Royal Admiral, in July, 1801, although the directors had 
repeatedly sent out articles to Port Jackson for Tahiti, yet the Missionaries 
had received neither supplies nor letters from England. Many vessels had sailed 
from Port Jackson, where the supplies were lying, and had afterwards touched at 
the island; but the captains, having no intention of doing so when they sailed, 
had refused to take the goods on board. Of tea and sugar, and many other 
comforts, they had long been destitute; and their apparel was scarcely such as 
to enable them to appear respectable in the company of any of their countrymen 
who might visit the island. Several of them were some years with only one pair 
of shoes; and often, in their journeys undertaken for the purpose of preaching, 
and instructing the natives, they had travelled barefoot. In addition to these 
privations, the gloom and discouragement that depressed their spirits, on 
account of the total want of success attending their labours, must have been 
increased, in a&#150; 75 &#150; great degree, by the uncertainty and anxiety of 
remaining, at that remote distance from home, five years, without even once 
hearing by letter from their native country, or their friends. From this 
distressing state of feeling, they were in a great measure relieved by the 
arrival of the Hawkesbury, a colonial vessel, which anchored in Matavai bay on 
the 25th of November, 1806.<br>
<br>
 Since the year 1804, the Society in 
England had authorized Mr. Marsden to expend annually, for the support of the 
Missionaries, two hundred pounds, and had also sent out supplies. Unable to 
meet, in Port Jackson, with any vessel proceeding to Tahiti, Mr. Marsden had at 
length engaged the Hawkesbury, a small sloop of about twenty tons burden, to 
take out the letters and articles that had been so long delayed. The 
communications from England conveyed to the Missionaries the welcome and the 
needed assurance that they were not forgotten by their friends at home; but 
most of the articles, especially those of clothing, from the length of time 
they had been lying at Port Jackson, and the wretched state of the vessel in 
which they were sent, were so injured as to be almost useless; the packages 
were wet with the sea-water, and their contents consequently spoiled.<br>
<br>
 
The repeated trials with which the Missionaries were exercised, the privations 
they endured, and the painful and protracted discouragements by which, at this 
period, they were depressed, were of no ordinary character. Few among modern 
Missionaries have been called to endure such afflictions; and it is matter of 
devout acknowledgment, that, notwithstanding the darkness of their prospects 
and the destitution of their circumstances, they were still enabled to 
persevere, and leave &#150; 76 &#150; the event with Him, at whose command they 
had entered on their work.<br>
<br>
 Peace continuing in the island during the 
close of 1806, and the beginning of 1807, allowed the teachers to pursue 
uninterruptedly their endeavours to plant Christianity among the inhabitants, 
although at that time with little prospect of success.<br>
<br>
 The ravages of 
diseases originating in licentiousness, or nurtured by the vicious habits of 
the people, and those first brought among them by European vessels, appeared to 
be fast hastening the total desolation of Tahiti. The survivors of such as were 
carried off by these means, feeling the incipient effects of disease 
themselves, and beholding their relatives languishing under maladies of foreign 
origin, inflicted, as they supposed, by the God of the foreigners, were led to 
view the Missionaries as in some degree the cause of their suffering; and 
frequently, not only rejected their message, but charged them with being the 
authors of their misery, by praying against them to their God. When the 
Missionaries spoke to them on the subject of religion, the deformed and 
diseased were sometimes brought out and ranged before them, as evidences of the 
efficacy of their prayers, and the destructive power of their God. The feelings 
of the people on this subject were frequently so strong, and their language so 
violent, that the Missionaries have been obliged to hasten from places where 
they had intended to address the people. Instead of listening with attention, 
the natives seemed only irritated by being, as they said, mocked with promises 
of advantage from a God, by whom, as they imagined, so much suffering had been 
inflicted. Under these circumstances,&#150; 77 &#150; their distresses were 
somewhat relieved by the arrival of Mr. Warner; who, after the ordinary 
preparation, had been sent from England in the capacity of surgeon to the 
Mission, which he joined on the 12th of May, 1807. The strength, however, which 
his arrival added to their establishment, was partially counterbalanced by the 
removal of Mr. Youl, one of those who had arrived in the Royal Admiral, and who 
departed in the vessel that conveyed Mr. Warner to Tahiti.<br>
<br>
 In the 
month of June, the flame of war was rekindled in Taiarabu, and the district of 
Atehuru, where the king's party suddenly attacked the inhabitants; and, after 
killing upwards of one hundred, including their principal chiefs, covered the 
country with all the murder and desolation that usually attended the march of 
the infuriated bands through the territories of those who were too weak to 
oppose their progress. Having driven to the mountains such as had escaped the 
slaughter in the assault, plundered their houses, and afterwards reduced them 
to ashes, the king took the bodies of the slain on board his fleet; and, 
sailing to Taurtira, offered them in sacrifice to Oro.<br>
<br>
 Towards the 
close of the year, the Mission sustained a heavy loss in the death of Mr. 
Jefferson. He was one of those Missionaries that arrived in the ship Duff; he 
had borne &#147;the heat and burden of the day,&#148; and finished his course 
on the 25th of September, 1807. He was a man of intelligence and ability, 
possessing extraordinary devotedness and parient zeal. He had laboured 
unremittingly for ten anxious years; filling, with credit to himself and 
advantage to the Mission, the most important station among his brethren, by 
whom he was highly and justly respected. He&#150; 78 &#150; maintained an 
arduous post among the pioneers of the little army of Christian Missionaries, 
who, &#147;unarmed with bow and sword,&#148; had ventured to attack idolatry in 
its strongest holds among these distant islands; and,</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>&#147;High on the pagan hills, where Satan sat <br>
 Encamped, and o'er the 
subject kingdoms threw<br>
 Perpetual night, to plant Immanuel's cross, <br>
 
The ensign of the gospel, blazing round<br>
 Immortal truth.&#148;</p> 
</blockquote> 
<p>And, though he fell upon the field before he heard or uttered the shout of 
victory, his end was peaceful, and his hopes were firm. On a visit to Matavai, 
in the early part of 1821, conducted by Mr. Nott, I made a pilgrimage to his 
grave. I stood beside the rustic hillock on which the tall grass waved in the 
breeze, and gazed upon the plain stone that marks the spot where his head 
reposes, with feelings of veneration for his character. I felt, also, in 
connexion with the change that has since taken place, that he had indeed 
desired to see the things that I beheld, but he had died, without witnessing, 
on earth, the gladdening sight; and that, in reference to his unremitted 
exertions, I and my junior companions had entered into his labours, and were 
reaping the harvest for which he had toiled.<br>
<br>
 Shortly after Mr. 
Jefferson's death, Mr. Nott, accompanied by Mr. Hayward, visited the islands of 
Huahine, Raiatea, and Borabora; travelled round each, preaching and teaching 
the people; and thus, for the first time, published among their inhabitants the 
great truths of Christianity. Many of the natives listened with attention and 
apparent interest. The illness of the king terminated, for a time, the war 
which he had commenced against the&#150; 79 &#150; people of Atehuru, and 
allowed the Missionaries uninterruptedly to pursue their labours in Tahiti.<br>

<br> Early in 1808, Mr. Elder left this island for Port Jackson. Peace at that 
period every where prevailed, but it was of short duration. The dissatisfaction 
of the farmers, inferior chiefs, and lower orders of the people, with Pomare's 
conduct, was daily increasing, and his recent massacre of the Atehuruans had 
greatly strengthened their determination to destroy his authority, and revive 
the ancient aristocratical form of government. In the month of October, the 
Missionaries received a note from the king, informing them of the probability 
of war, recommending them to be upon their guard, and not to be deceived or 
taken by surprise. In consequence of this intimation, and the increasing signs 
of approaching hostilities, they established a strict nightly watch, and seldom 
went far from their dwelling. The preparations for battle were continued on 
both sides; every morning it was expected that hostilities would commence 
before the close of the day, and every night it was apprehended that an attack 
would be made before morning. In this state of distressing anxiety, without any 
means of flying from the gathering storm, all the families continued till the 
25th of October, when a vessel from Port Jackson providentially anchored in the 
bay, and, by ensuring a safe retreat in the event of sudden assault, afforded 
no small alleviation to their minds.<br>
<br>
 On the Sabbath-day, the 6th of 
November, the district of Matavai was thrown into great confusion, and numbers 
of men appeared in arms. The king, who was on board the ship at the time, 
hastened on shore, and was only restrained from commencing an immediate attack 
by the counsel of his&#150; 80 &#150; uncle, who urged the necessity of 
invoking the favour of the gods before commencing hostilities. This afforded 
the people of Matavai time to retire, and encamp in the adjoining district with 
the people of Apaiano. Proposals of peace were sent by the king, but the 
rebels, being reinforced from districts to the estward, refused to meet Pomare, 
or negociate with him; and war appeared inevitable.<br>
<br>
 The king, 
expecting that his camp, which was at Matavai, would be immediately attacked, 
recommended that the wives and children of the Missionaries should take shelter 
in the vessel. They embarked on the 7th amid much confusion, but with the 
sincerest gratitude to God for the refuge so seasonably provided. The night 
passed without any attack; several leading chiefs, whom the rebels expected, 
had not arrived, and the Europeans were thus permitted to pack up a few 
articles for their use on board. The next morning a letter was addressed to the 
captain, requesting him to delay his departure forty-eight hours, that they 
might deliberate on the steps necessary to be taken. On the following day, the 
Missionaries Nott and Scott, as messengers of peace, went alone, unarmed, to 
the rebel camp at Apaiano, and invited the leaders to an interview with Pomare. 
The chiefs treated them with every mark of friendship, regretted that their 
establishment should suffer from the quarrel between them and the king, and 
requested them not to leave the island. The leaders of the rebels refused, 
however, to meet Pomare except in battle, and every hope of accommodation now 
vanished.<br>
<br>
 This disastrous war is called, in the Tahitian traditions, 
the Tamai rahi ia Arahuraia, The great war of Arahuraia. It was headed by Taute,
&#150; 81 &#150; who had long been the king's prime-minister, and who was one 
of the most powerful chiefs and successful warriors on the islands. His name 
inspired terror through the ranks of his enemies; and when the king heard that 
he had joined the rebels, he was so much affected, that he burst into tears. 
Pomare advised the married Missionaries to leave the island. They were 
unanimous in opinion, that there was no prospect of safety or usefulness, even 
should the rebel chiefs prove their friends; and this, together with the 
consideration of the little success that had attended the labours of so many 
years, occasioned their determination to remove. Four of the unmarried 
Missionaries offered to remain with the king, that they might be upon the spot, 
should any favourable change take place; the others, with most of the Europeans 
on the island, sailed from Tahiti on the 10th of November, 1808, and arrived 
the following day at the island of Huahine. Here they were hospitably received 
by the chiefs and people.<br>
<br>
 The affairs of Tahiti continued in the same 
state until the 22d of December; when the king, influenced by Metia, the 
prophet of Oro, attacked the rebels; who were not only superior in numbers, but 
favoured in the conflict by the occupation of an advantageous position. 
Notwithstanding the prophet's prediction of victory, Pomare was defeated, and 
fled with precipitation to Pare; leaving a number of muskets in the hands of 
his enemies, and several principal warriors among the slain. Convinced, that 
though the chiefs of the victorious army might be friendly to them, yet that 
they could not restrain their followers, who, in time of war, threw off all 
subordination; and expecting that the victors, after this success, would 
instantly&#150; 82 &#150; attack their dwelling, and that their lives were no 
longer secure, the Missionaries remaining at Tahiti fled to Eimeo, where they 
were shortly after joined by the king. Some months afterwards, three of them 
were compelled to follow their companions to Huahine. During their residence 
here, some had made the tour of the island, and endeavoured, with but little 
prospect of success, to instruct the inhabitants.<br>
<br>
 The melancholy 
aspect of affairs, their expulsion from Tahiti, the total destruction of the 
settlement, and the little probability of a restoration of peace, induced them 
to determine on removing by the first opportunity to Port Jackson. This 
occurred in the course of the year; and on the 26th of October, 1809, they all 
sailed from the islands, excepting Mr. Hayward, who remained in Huahine, and 
Mr. Nott, who still resided in Eimeo with the king.<br>
<br>
 After the victory 
of the 22d of December 1808, the rebels plundered the district of Matavai and 
Pare, and, devoting to destruction every house and plantation, reduced the 
whole country to a state of the wildest desolation and ruin. The mission houses 
were ransacked and burnt, and whatever the insurgents were unable to carry away 
was destroyed. Every implement of iron was converted into a weapon of war. The 
most valuable books were either committed to the flames, or distributed among 
the warriors for the purpose of making cartridge papers, and the printing types 
were melted into musket balls.<br>
<br>
 During such seasons, it was not merely 
apprehension, but actual danger, to which all the Europeans were exposed. On 
one occasion, Mr. Nott, returning from a visit to the king, was resting in a 
&#150; 83 &#150; native house, when a party of the rebels approached the spot; 
his native companion, one of Pomare's warriors, observing them, touched him on 
the shoulder, and urged him to fly to the canoe lying on the beach: he and his 
fellow-traveller had scarcely pushed off from the shore, when the men came up, 
and, finding they had escaped, invited them to land, or requested the native to 
allow the foreigner to walk. Mr. Nott's companion assured him, however, that if 
he landed, his life would certainly be taken, merely because he was a friend to 
the king. The natives followed the canoe for some miles, but Mr. Nott was 
mercifully preserved, and reached Matavai in safety, indebted, under God, to 
the vigilance and promptitude of his Tahitian friend, for his life. Before this 
time, a musket, ball, aimed at a native who had taken shelter in his house, was 
fired through the window of the room in which he was sitting; and during 
another war, the spear of one of the king's enemies was already poised, and 
would in all probability have inflicted a fatal wound in his body, had not the 
interference of one of Mr. Nott's friends, at the moment, saved him from the 
deadly thrust.<br>
<br>
 It is not easy to form an accurate idea of the 
distress of the last Missionaries who reluctantly left Tahiti, when they beheld 
their gardens demolished, their houses plundered and burnt, their pupils 
engaged in all the barbarity of a savage war; and the people, among whom they 
had hoped to introduce order, and peace, and happiness, doomed to the 
complicated miseries attending anarchy, idolatry, and the varied horrors of 
cruelty and vice. The enterprise in which they had embarked, had at its 
commencement united, in bonds of disinterested philanthropy, parties before but 
seldom&#150; 84 &#150; associated; and had, by a vigorous and combined 
movement, in force and magnitude surpassing any thing that had been hitherto 
attempted by British Christians, introduced a new era in the Missionary efforts 
of modern times. It had excited among all classes the liveliest interest, 
called forth splendid efforts of sacred eloquence, and noble deeds of Christian 
benevolence; but, painful and deeply humiliating as it was, it now appeared to 
those devoted servants of God, who had, amidst protracted and severe 
privations, maintained their ground till life was no longer secure&#151;after 
having engaged the prayers of the people of God, and waited in vain for the 
results of patient and self-denying toil, during twelve eventful 
years&#151;that the scene of their labour must be abandoned.<br>
<br>
 Their 
enemies at home became bold in denouncing the enterprise as the wild project of 
extravagance and folly, and stamping upon its projectors and conductors the 
impress of the blindest fanaticism. Even those who, though they had not 
condemned the scheme as Utopian and visionary, had withheld their sanction and 
their aid, now pointed to the deserted field as a demonstration of the 
soundness of their judgment, and an explanation of their conduct. There were 
others also, who, whatever might be their opinion of the measure itself, and 
however they might approve or disapprove of the choice of those with whom it 
originated, in the selection of the most distant, isolated, and, as it regarded 
the moral character of its inhabitants, the most unpromising parts of the 
world, for the first field of their labours, considered its projectors as 
influenced in a great degree by self-confidence, and a desire of aggrandisement 
or applause. It has sometimes been unwarrantably&#150; 85 &#150; insinuated, 
that the founders of the Missionary Society expected to convert the heathen to 
Christianity by their own energy; and the allegation has been occasionally 
repeated since those days,&#151;perhaps, in some instances, to increase the 
impression produced by the accounts of the recent changes which have taken 
place in those islands, contrasting the former and latter results of Missionary 
labours, and representing them as demonstrations of the impotency of man, and 
the power of the Most High. The lively feeling that attended the establishment 
of the Missionary Society, the liberality of the principles recognized as its 
basis, and the combination of different parties in its support, were at that 
time adapted to excite in minds of a cautious and deliberative habit, and 
fearful of innovation, the apprehension that it had originated in a desire, on 
the part of its projectors, to signalize themselves, and secure a name and 
influence in the Christian world, to which they were not otherwise entitled. 
Individuals, whose minds were deeply imbued with the subject, who had 
identified themselves with its progress and its results, and had embarked not 
only their influence, but much of their property, in the undertaking, might, 
and probably did, under the ardour of their feelings, indulge on some occasions 
in a splendour of imagery, and a richness of description, that exceeded the 
sober realities of fact: but they never imagined that they could subvert any 
system of idolatry by their own agency; or, that their efforts would be in any 
degree effectual for the conversion of the people, but as they were attended by 
the influence of the Holy Spirit. There might be, and perhaps was, a more 
confident hope of the speedy accomplishment of the object than now prevails;
&#150; 86 &#150; but the appeals and addresses, delivered at that period, 
manifest a deep conviction of human insufficiency, and breathe a spirit of 
entire dependence upon the blessing of God.<br>
<br>
 But although Tahiti was, 
by the departure of the Missionaries, surrendered, for a season, as a prey to 
the spoiler, and subjected to the rule of ignorance, barbarism, and idolatry, 
it was not abandoned by Him, in obedience, to whose command to &#147;go and 
teach all nations,&#148; the Mission had been undertaken. He had still 
&#147;thoughts of mercy&#148; towards its inhabitants, and was, by this 
distressing event, teaching those who had undertaken the work&#151;and 
instructing his church, in regard to all their future efforts to extend his 
gospel&#151;that singleness of aim, purity of motive, and patient diligence in 
labour, were of themselves insufficient for the work; that it was by His Spirit 
that the heathen were to be converted; and without His blessing, Paul might 
plant, and Apollos might water, in vain.</p>

<br>
 The rebels were no sooner masters 
of the island, than they resolved to pursue the most efficacious methods of 
establishing and perpetuating their power: arms and ammunition, they regarded 
as the best means of accomplishing this; and in order to secure these, as well 
as extend their conquests, they determined to murder the captain and officers, 
and to seize the first vessel that should arrive. The Missionaries, aware of 
this, wrote a letter of precaution, which they gave to a native, to hand to the 
master of the first ship that might touch there. The Venus schooner, however, 
arrived, and was seized by the people, before the native could deliver his 
letter: the master and seamen were not murdered, but kept prisoners, to be 
offered in sacrifice to Oro. The Hibernia, Captain&#150; 88 &#150; Campbell, 
also arrived shortly afterwards; but Captain Campbell, receiving the letter, 
was warned of his danger, and not only secured his own vessel, but succeeded in 
rescuing the schooner and her crew.<br>
<br>
 In the year 1809, Mr. Nott alone 
remained with the king and the people in the island of Eimeo; the other 
Missionaries, with the exception of Mr. Hayward, removed from Huahine to Port 
Jackson. Although the gospel had been faithfully and constantly preached, for 
some years in Tahiti, occasionally in most of the other islands, and many of 
the people had imbibed a tolerably clear speculative knowledge of the leading 
doctrines taught in the sacred volume, yet there was no individual on whom they 
could look, as having been benefited by their instructions&#151;no one whose 
mind was savingly enlightened, or whose heart had experienced any moral change. 
Discouraging as these circumstances were, the Missionaries would not have 
abandoned their station, but for the destruction with which the civil war, and 
the defeat of the king, seriously threatened them; and, in addition to this 
darkened aspect of affairs, as it regarded the success of their enterprise, the 
state of feeling, bordering on hopeless despair, under which they departed from 
the islands, greatly augmented their distress. On their arrival in New South 
Wales, they were received with kindness by their friends, and a feeling of 
compassion at their disasters, and sympathy in their distress, was manifested 
by the governor, the Rev. S. Marsden, the principal chaplain, and other friends 
of the Mission.<br>
<br>
 While in Port Jackson, they received affectionate and 
encouraging letters from the Society, and their friends in England, and 
communications of a&#150; 89 &#150; most touching, yet confident kind, from the 
king, who invited their return.<br>
<br>
 The way being thus opened for the 
resumption of their work, and depending on the blessing of God, they again 
embarked, in the autumn of 1811, for the islands. During their absence, Pomare 
had remained excluded from his hereditary dominions, and in exile on the island 
of Eimeo. Whether the melancholy reverses he had experienced, and the 
depression of spirits consequent upon the dissolution of his government, and 
the desolation of his family, led him to doubt the truth of that system of 
idol-worship to which he had been devoted, and on which he had invariably 
relied for success in every enterprise&#151;or whether the leisure it afforded 
for contemplation and inquiry, under the influence of these feelings, inclined 
him to reflect more seriously on the truth of those declarations he had often 
heard respecting the true God, and to consider his present condition as the 
chastening of that Being whom he had refused to acknowledge&#151;it is 
impossible to determine; but these disastrous events had evidently subdued his 
spirit, and softened his heart.<br>
<br>
 When the Missionaries who returned 
from Port Jackson landed in Eimeo, the king received them with the warmest 
demonstrations of joy. Mr. and Mrs. Bicknell, the first who arrived, resided 
some time in the same house with him. He spent much of his time in reading and 
writing, in conversation, and in earnest inquiry about God, and the way of 
acceptance with Him, through Jesus Christ,&#151;and sometimes spoke in terms 
astonishing even to the Missionaries themselves. One or two other natives 
appeared also favourably impressed in regard to the religion of the Bible. 
Under these auspicious appearances,&#150; 90 &#150; although prevented by the 
unsettled state of Tahiti from resuming their station in Matavai, the 
Missionaries were enabled to commence their labours in the island of Eimeo. 
They also indulged a hope of establishing a Mission in Raiatea, one of the 
Leeward or Society Islands, when a series of domestic trials frustrated their 
plans of extended usefulness, and confined them for several years to this 
island.<br>
<br>
 On the 28th of July, 1812, Mrs. Henry finished her earthly 
career. She had accompanied her husband from her native country in the ship 
Duff, with the first Missionaries who landed in Tahiti. In all the trials of 
the Mission she had sustained her part; and, with unwavering devotedness to its 
interests, had endeavoured to perform with efficiency and cheerfulness the 
duties of her station, until her life fell a sacrifice to the privations and 
toils of her eventful and perilous career. It was, however, a sacrifice 
cheerfully offered on her part. Her memory was greatly esteemed by those who 
had borne with her the burden of the day, and survived her in the field. In a 
letter to the Directors of the London Missionary Society, under the date of 
June 24, 1813, the Rev. S. Marsden thus wrote of Mrs. Henry&#151;&#147;No 
woman, in my opinion, could be more sincere, and more devoted to the work, than 
she was. Her natural disposition was amiable, her piety unaffected, and her 
love for the poor heathens unfeigned. I trust she is now resting from her 
labours in Abraham's bosom; and that some poor heathens, amongst whom she has 
lived, have gone before, and that some will follow after, to glory.&#148; This 
afflictive bereavement was followed by another equally painful, namely, the 
death of&#150; 91 &#150; Mrs. Davies,&#151;which took place on the fourth of 
the following September. Her disconsolate partner had scarcely received the 
sympathies of his companions in exile and labour, when the newly closed grave 
of the mother was opened again, to receive the remains of an infant daughter, 
who survived its parent but three short weeks. In one week more, Mrs. Hayward 
terminated in death her sufferings, and was buried by the side of her departed 
sisters. Hence, the letters which conveyed to England the animating tidings of 
the first dawning of a brighter day on Tahiti, conveyed also the sad recital of 
these inroads of death; and well might the Missionaries on that occasion 
&#147;sing of mercy and of judgment.&#148;<br>
<br>
 When death enters a 
family, and removes a wife and a mother from the domestic circle, though every 
alleviation which society, friendship, and religion can impart are available, 
there is a chasm left, and a wound inflicted on the survivors, which must be 
felt in order to be understood: when death repeatedly enters in this way a 
family connexion, the distress is proportionably augmented; but it is 
impossible to form an adequate idea of the desolateness of the Mission family, 
(for such it might be called,) at this time, and the cheerless solitude of 
those thus bereft of the partners of their days, and the mothers of their 
children. They were left to sustain alone the toils, sorrows, and privations of 
their remote and isolated station, and privations of their remote and isolated 
station, and to pursue in solitary pilgrimage the arduous and rugged track in 
which the providence of God had called them to walk, far from the sympathy of 
the kindred and friends of the departed. They were equally remote from all the 
kind attentions of tenderest friendship, the rich consolations of Christian
&#150; 92 &#150; intercourse, and the public ordinances of that religion, which 
is alone adapted to impart effectual consolation. Cut off also from the 
endearments of home, the pleasures of society in civilized life, the 
satisfaction derived from books, and the reciprocal interchange of all the 
offices of friendship, the only earthly solace a Missionary enjoys among an 
uncivilized people, except what he derives from his work, is found in the 
social endearments of the domestic circle. However remote from the land of his 
nativity may be its locality, however humble its structure, however rude its 
appendages, or limited its sources of comfort, compared with what in other 
parts may be enjoyed,&#151;around his rustic hearth, and in the bosom of his 
family, he finds the scene of his richest earthly felicity. In any situation, 
bereavements such as those which befel the little band at Eimeo at this time, 
would have been distressing: to the Missionaries they were peculiarly so. The 
channels of comfort were dried up, and though they had free access to the 
Fountain of all blessedness and consolation, and were enabled to say, &#147;He 
hath done all things well,&#148; yet their trial must have been peculiarly 
poignant and oppressive. It is remarkable, that at a period of such 
unparalleled domestic distress, the most encouraging appearances of the Divine 
favour towards the nation around them, should have been afforded; and it is 
probable that the very cheering prospects under which they were at this time 
called upon to pursue their Missionary engagements, greatly alleviated their 
sorrow.<br>
<br>
 They had established public worship; Mr. Davies had opened a 
school; an increased and pleasing attention had been manifested, by several, to 
the&#150; 93 &#150; instructions communicated; and only ten days before the 
death of Mrs. Henry, Pomare, the king of Tahiti, publicly professed his belief 
in Jehovah the true God, and his determination to serve him. He also requested 
to be baptized, and to become one of the disciples of the Lord Jesus Christ, 
assuring the Missionaries that his resolution to give himself up to God, was 
the result of long and increasing conviction of the truth and superiority of 
the religion of the Bible, expressing at the same time his desire to be more 
fully instructed in the matters to which it referred.<br>
<br>
 Pomare had for 
some time past shewn his contempt for the idols of his ancestors, and his 
desire to be taught a more excellent way, that he might obtain the favour of 
the true God. The natives had watched the change in his mind with the most 
fearful apprehension, as to its results upon the minds of his subjects. They 
were powerfully affected on one occasion when a present was brought him of a 
turtle, which had always been held sacred, and dressed with sacred fire within 
the precincts of the temple, part of it being invariably offered to the idol. 
The attendants were proceeding with the turtle to the<i>marae</i>, when Pomare 
called them back, and told them to prepare an oven, to bake it in his own 
kitchen, and serve it up, without offering it to the idol. The people around 
were astonished, and could hardly believe the king was in a state of sanity, or 
was really in earnest. The king repeated his direction; a fire was made, the 
turtle baked, and served up at the next repast. The people of the king's 
household stood, in mute expectation of some fearful visitation of the god's 
anger, as soon as he should touch a morsel of the fish; by which he had, in 
this instance, committed, as they&#150; 94 &#150; imagined, an act of daring 
impiety. The king cut up the turtle, and began to eat it, inviting some that 
sat at meat with him to do the same; but no one could be induced to touch it, 
as they expected every moment to see him either expire, or writhe in strong 
convulsions. The king endeavoured to convince his companions that their idea of 
the power of the gods was altogether imaginary, and that they had been the 
subjects of complete delusion; but the people could not believe him: and 
although the meal was finished without any evil result, they carried away the 
dishes with many expressions of astonishment, confidently expecting some 
judgment would overtake him before the morrow, for they could not believe that 
an act of sacrilege, such as he had been guilty of, could be committed with 
impunity.<br>
<br>
 The conduct and conversation of Pomare in reference to the 
gods, on this and similar occasions, must necessarily have weakened the 
influence of idolatry on the minds of those by those by whom he was attended; 
and if it produced no immediate and salutary effect on them, it doubtless 
confirmed his own belief in the vanity of idols, and the folly of indulging 
either hope or fear respecting them. A number of the principal chiefs of the 
Leeward Islands, as well as the adherents to his cause, and the friends of his 
family in Tahiti, constantly resided with the king, after his expulsion from 
the island of his ancestors, and accompanied him on his return to resume his 
former government. He spared no efforts, favourably to impress them in regard 
to Christianity; but to no purpose for a long time. When he offered himself for 
baptism, he stated that he had endeavoured to persuade Tamatoa, his 
father-in-law, and Tapoa, the king and&#150; 95 &#150; principal chief of 
Raiatea, to renounce idolatry, and become the disciples of Jesus Christ; but 
they had assured him, whatever he might do, they would adhere to Oro. Others 
expressed the same determination; and Pomare came forward alone, requesting 
baptism, and desiring to hear and obey the word of God, as he said &#147;he 
desired to be happy after death, and to be saved at the day of judgment.&#148; 
He did not confine his efforts to private conversation, but in public council 
urged upon Tamatoa and Mahine, the chiefs of Raiatea and Huahine, the adoption 
of the Christian religion; hereby publicly evincing his own determination to 
adhere to the choice he had made.<br>
<br>
 The Missionaries had every reason 
to believe that the king was sincere in his desires to become a Christian; but 
as they then deemed only those who were true converts to Christianity, proper 
subjects for the rite of baptism, and feared that his mind might not be 
sufficiently informed on the nature and design of that ordinance, and that he 
was rather an earnest inquirer after divine truth, than an actual possessor of 
its moral principle and spiritual influence, they proposed to him to defer his 
baptism until he had received more ample instruction. They were also desirous 
to receive additional evidence of his sincerity, and of the uprightness and the 
purity of his conduct, during a longer period than they had yet observed it. 
The king acquiesced in their proposal, and requested their instructions.<br>

<br> At the same time that the king thus publicly desired to profess 
Christianity, he proposed to erect a large and substantial building for the 
worship of the true God. His own affairs remained unsettled and discouraging; 
he was still in exile;&#150; 96 &#150; and rumours of war not only prevailed in 
Tahiti, but invasion threatened Eimeo. This island the Missionaries considered 
only as a temporary residence, till they should be able to resume their labours 
in Tahiti, or establish a mission in the Leeward Islands, and therefore 
recommended him to defer it. But he replied, &#147;No, let us not mind these 
things, let it be built.&#148;<br>
<br>
 Shortly after this important event, 
which may justly be considered as the dawning of that day, and the first ray of 
that light, which has since shed such lustre, and beamed with such power, upon 
these isles of the sea, two chiefs arrived from Tahiti, inviting Pomare to 
return, and resume his government, promising an amicable adjustment of their 
differences. The interests of his kingdom appeared to require his concurrence 
with their proposal; and, on the thirteenth of August, in less than a month 
after the pleasing event referred to, he sailed with them from Eimeo, followed 
by the chiefs and people from the Leeward Islands, and most of the inhabitants 
of Papetoai and its vicinity. His departure, in his critical state of mind, was 
much to be regretted, as it deprived him of the instructions of his teachers, 
exposed him to many temptations, and much persecution.<br>
<br>
 Pomare, in 
infancy, had been rocked in the cradle of paganism, and trained under its 
influence through subsequent life. His father Pomare, and his mother Idia, were 
probably more infatuated with idolatry, and more uniformly attached to the 
idols, and every institution connected with their worship, than even the 
priests, or perhaps any other individuals in the islands. He had been early 
initiated in all the mysteries of falsehood and abomination connected with the 
system, and had&#150; 97 &#150; engaged with avidity in the bloody and 
murderous rites of idol worship. In addition to this, he had been nurtured amid 
the debasing and polluting immorality, for which his country, ever since its 
discovery, had been distinguished; and although his ideas of the moral 
perfections of the true God might be but indistinct, and his views of the 
purity required by the gospel but partial, yet it might naturally be expected, 
that the convictions of guilt in such an individual, when first awakened to a 
sense of the nature and consequence of sin, would be deep and severe. That this 
was actually the case, appears from several letters which he wrote to the 
Missionaries soon after his arrival in Tahiti, as well as from the conversation 
they had with him on the subject.<br>
<br>
 In a letter, dated Tahiti, 
September 25, 1812, he thus expresses himself: &#147;May the anger of Jehovah 
be appeased towards me, who am a wicked man, guilty of accumulated 
crimes,&#151;of regardlessness and ignorance of the true God, and of an 
obstinate perseverance in wickedness! May Jehovah also pardon my foolishness, 
unbelief, and rejection of the truth! May Jehovah give me his good Spirit to 
sanctify my heart, that I may love what is good, and that I may be enabled to 
put away all my evil customs, and become one of his people, and be saved 
through Jesus Christ, our only Saviour! I am a wicked man, and my sins are 
great and accumulated. But O that we may all be saved, through Jesus 
Christ.&#148; Referring to his illness about this time, he said, &#147;My 
affliction is great; but if I can only obtain God's favour before I die, I 
shall count myself well. But Oh! should I die with my sins unpardoned, it will 
be ill indeed with me. O ! may my sins be pardoned,&#150; 98 &#150; and my soul 
saved, through Jesus Christ! May Jehovah regard me before I die, and then I 
shall rejoice, because I have obtained favour of Jehovah.&#148;<br>
<br>
 In 
another letter, written about a fortnight afterwards, he observes, &#147;I 
continue to pray to God without ceasing. Regardless of other things, I am 
concerned only that my soul may be saved by Jesus Christ! It is my earnest 
desire, that I may become one of Jehovah's people; and that God may turn away 
his anger from me, which I deserve, for my wickedness, my ignorance of him, and 
my accumulated crimes!&#148; In February, 1813, he wrote to the following 
effect. &#147;The Almighty can (or will) make me good. I venture with my guilt, 
(or evil deeds) to Jesus Christ, though I am not equalled in wickedness, not 
equalled in guilt, not equalled in obstinate disobedience, and rejection of the 
truth, hoping that this very wicked man may be saved by Jehovah Jesus 
Christ.&#148;<br>
<br>
 Such was the interesting state of Pomare's mind, at the 
close of the year 1812, and the commencement of 1813. At the same time that 
this event shed such light upon the prospects of the Missionaries, other 
circumstances concurred, to confirm them in the conviction, that God was about 
to favour in a signal manner their enterprise, to follow their labours with his 
blessing, and with still greater success. Of one or two other natives they had 
every reason to hope most favourably, while one, who died about this time, left 
a pleasing testimony behind, of repentance, and reliance on the pardoning mercy 
of God.<br>
<br>
 The king's visit to Tahiti did not succeed so well as the 
messengers had promised, or his friends&#150; 99 &#150; had anticipated: 
rumours of war prevailed in the western and southern parts of the island, and 
many of the chiefs sent professions of subjection; but the continuance of such 
acknowledgment was uncertain. Some of his ablest allies, especially Tapoa the 
chief of Raiatea, was removed by death, and the others prepared to return to 
their own islands. Early in the following year, the district of Matavai was 
surrendered to Pomare, but he was justly doubtful of the sincerity of the 
surrender. Amidst all these unfavourable circumstances, he continued bold and 
uncompromising in his renunciation of the idols, and every rite of idolatry; 
observing the sabbath, and, on every suitable occasion, exhibiting the truth 
and excellency of the religion of Jesus Christ. Although this honourable 
conduct produced a surprising effect upon the minds of many of the inhabitants 
of Tahiti and Eimeo, who considered the king better acquainted both with the 
religion of the natives, and that of the foreigners, than any other person in 
the islands; it procured him many enemies, and exposed him to no ordinary 
degree of ridicule and persecution, or contempt, not only from his idolatrous 
rivals, but from his allies, and the members of his household and family. These 
attributed all his reverses to the respect he had shewn the Missionaries, and 
the inclination he had indulged towards their God; and declared that he need 
not expect his affairs to be retrieved, since he had forsaken the gods of his 
ancestors, and insulted those to whom his family was indebted for the elevated 
distinction to which it had been raised in Tahiti, and the neighbouring 
islands. Pomare, however, was uninfluenced by any of these representations, 
and, notwithstanding the embarrassed state of his&#150; 100 &#150; affairs, and 
the uncertainty of the result, to which the present agitation, and the 
approaching national assembly of chiefs and people, might lead; and though his 
friends added insult and reproach to his misfortunes, he remained stedfast.<br>

<br> The communications between Tahiti and Eimeo were now frequent, and the 
repeated accounts of Pomare's persevering and laudable endeavours to enlighten 
the minds of his subjects, were not the only cheering tidings they received. 
Mr. Bicknell went over in a vessel bound to the Pearl Islands, and in a few 
days returned, with the pleasing report that a spirit of inquiry had been 
awakened among some of the inhabitants of that island, and that two of those 
they had formerly instructed, had occasionally met to pray to God. In order to 
ascertain the nature and extent of the desire which had been excited, and to 
confer with the individuals under its influence, Messrs. Scott and Hayward, 
having been deputed by their companions to visit Tahiti, sailed over from 
Eimeo, on the 15th of June, 1813. Although the king was residing in Matavai, 
they landed in the district of Pare, and, proceeding to the valley of Hautaua, 
they learned that the report was correct, and that in the neighbourhood there 
were some who had renounced idolatry, and professed to believe in Jehovah, the 
true God.<br>
<br>
 On the following morning, according to the usual practice 
when travelling among the people, they retired to the bushes near their 
lodgings, for meditation and secret prayer. The houses of the natives, however 
large they might be, never contained more than one room; and were generally so 
crowded with people, that retirement was altogether unattainable. While seeking 
this, about&#150; 101 &#150; the dawn of the day, on the morning after their 
arrival, Mr. Scott heard a voice at no great distance from his retreat. It was 
not a few detached sentences that were spoken, but a continued address; not in 
the lively tone of conversation, but solemn, as devotion; or pathetic, as the 
voice of lamentation and supplication.<br>
<br>
 A variety of feelings led him 
to approach the spot whence these sounds proceeded, in order to hear more 
distinctly. O, what hallowed music must have broken on his listening ear, and 
what rapture must have thrilled his soul, when he distinctly recognized the 
voice of prayer, and heard a native, in the accents of his mother-tongue, with 
an ardour that proved his sincerity, addressing petitions and thanksgivings to 
the throne of mercy. It was the first time he knew that a native on Tahiti had 
prayed to any but his idols; it was the first native voice in praise and 
prayer, that he had ever heard, and he listened almost entranced with the 
appropriate and glowing language of devotion, then employed, until his feelings 
could be restrained no longer. Tears of joy started from his gladdened eye, and 
rolled in swift succession down his cheeks, while he could scarcely forbear 
rushing to the spot, and clasping in his arms the unconscious author of his 
ecstacy. He stood transfixed as it were to the earth, till the native retired; 
when he bowed his knees, and, screened from human observation by the verdant 
shrubs, offered up, under the canopy of heaven, his grateful adoration to the 
Most High, under all the melting of soul, and the excitement of spirit, which 
the unprecedented, unexpected, though long-desired events of the morning had 
inspired. When the Missionaries met at the house in which&#150; 102 &#150; they 
had lodged, the good tidings were communicated; the individual was sought out; 
and they were cheered with the simple yet affecting account he gave of what God 
had done for his own soul, and of the serious impressions then operating on the 
minds of several of his countrymen.<br>
<br>
 His name was then Oito, though it 
is now Petero; he had formerly been an inmate of the Mission family at Matavai, 
and had received instructions there. He had occasionally been with the king 
since his return to Tahiti, and some remarks from Pomare had awakened 
convictions of sin in his conscience. Anxious to obtain direction and relief, 
yet having no one to whom he could unburden his mind with hopes of suitable 
guidance, he applied to Tuahine, who had for a long time lived with the 
Missionaries; hence Oito inferred he would be able to direct him aright. 
Tuahine has since rendered the most important services to the Mission, by 
aiding Mr. Nott in the translations. When the Gospel by John, and the Acts of 
the Apostles, were finished, and Mr. Nott left Huahine, in July 1819, he 
removed to Raiatea, his native island, where he has since been not only a 
useful member of society, and an ornament to the religion he professes, but an 
officer in the Christian church in Raiatea.<br>
<br>
 Tuahine's mind, on the 
subject of the Christian religion, was at this period in a state resembling 
that of Oito's. Their conversation deepened their impressions; they frequently 
met afterwards for this purpose, and often retired to the privacy of the 
sequestered valleys or verdant shrubberies adjacent to their dwellings, for 
conversion and prayer. The singularity of their conduct, together with the 
report of the change in the sentiments of the king, soon&#150; 103 &#150; 
attracted observation: many derided them, but several young men and boys 
attached themselves to Oito and Tuahine, and this little band, without any 
Missionary to teach them, or even before any one was acquainted with the 
circumstance, agreed to refrain from worshipping the idols&#151;from the evil 
practices of their country&#151;to observe the Sabbath-day,&#151;and to worship 
Jehovah alone. They had established among themselves a meeting for prayer, 
which they held on the Sabbath, and often assembled at other times for social 
worship.<br>
<br>
 This intelligence was like life from the dead to the 
Missionaries; they thanked God, and took courage; but, before commencing their 
journey round Tahiti, they wrote to their brethren in Eimeo an account of what 
they had seen and heard: declaring all that they had heard was true, that God 
had &#147;also granted to the Gentiles repentance unto life,&#148; that some 
had cast away their idols, and were stretching out their hands in prayer to 
God, &amp;c. The effect of their letter was scarcely less on the minds of the 
Missionaries in Eimeo, than the recital had been to themselves in Tahiti. They 
were deeply affected, even unto tears. I have often heard Mr. Nott speak, with 
evident indications of strong feeling, of the emotions with which this letter 
was read. And when we consider the long and cheerless years, which he and some 
of his associates had spent in fruitless, hopeless toil, on that unpromising 
field, the reasonable prospect of an ultimate harvest, which these facts 
certainly warranted, was adapted to produce unusual and exalted 
joys,&#151;emphatically a Missionary's own,&#151;joys &#147;that a stranger 
intermeddleth not with.&#148;<br>
<br>
 Messrs. Scott and Hayward made the tour 
of Tahiti, preaching to the people whenever they&#150; 104 &#150; could collect 
a congregation, and then returned to Eimeo with Tuahine, Oito, and their 
companions,&#151;who accompanied them, in order to attend the school, and 
receive more ample instruction in those things, respecting which, though 
formerly so indifferent, they were now most anxious to be informed.<br>
<br>
 
Tuahine was born in the island of Raiatea, but had been some time residing in 
the inland parts of the district of Pare. Oito was an inhabitant, if not a 
native, of Hautaua, and in this lovely, verdant, and sequestered valley, the 
first native meeting for prayer was held, and the first associated vows were 
paid to Heaven.<br>
<br>
 I was personally acquainted with Oito while he 
resided in Eimeo, and have often passed along the mouth or opening of this 
valley, but regret that I never had an opportunity of traversing its interior, 
and visiting the abode of Oito, or the sites of the rural oratories of the 
first Christiains in Tahiti. Hautaua valley is an interesting spot, not only on 
account of the events connected spot, not only on account of the events 
connected with the early history of Christianity, which transpired within its 
borders, but also from the peculiarity of its scenery.</p>

<br>

 Soon after the return of Messrs Scott and Hayward from Tahiti, indications of 
the same convictions and inquiry were occasionally manifested in Eimeo; and on 
the 25th of July, 1813, which was the Sabbath, the first place for public 
worship erected in the island of Eimeo was opened. It was also the first 
building in the islands ever used by the natives for this sacred purpose. The 
exercises of the day were highly interesting both to the Missionaries and their 
little band of followers. At the close of the evening service Mr. Davies gave 
notice, according to previous arrangements, that on the following morning a 
public meeting would be held; when all who had sincerely renounced their false 
gods, who had desired also to relinquish their evil customs, to receive Jehovah 
for their God, and to be instructed in his word, were invited to&#150; 106 
&#150; attend. Forty natives came at the time appointed; the design of the 
meeting was explained by Mr. Nott. It was, to urge those who were decided, and 
wished to become sincere disciples of Jesus Christ, to make their desires 
known&#151;that the Missionaries might pay them special attention, and give 
them suitable instructions: they listened attentively, and many appeared deeply 
affected. They were afterwards individually interrogated as to their desires in 
reference to these important matters: during this inquiry thirty-one declared 
that they had renounced the idols, their worship, and every practice connected 
with idolatry; wishing to abandon every thing contrary to the word of God. 
These thirty-one requested to have their names written down, as those who 
desired to worship God, and to become disciples of Christ. Others said they 
intended to cast away their idols, but did not wish to have their names written 
down at that time. All who felt inclined to come were invited, but none were 
urged. The names of these thirty-one were written down; and among the first of 
them, Oito and Tuahine's were to be seen. In writing down the names of those 
who thus publicly professed Christianity, the Missionaries were influenced by a 
desire, not only to instruct them more fully, but to become personally 
acquainted with them, and to exercise over them a guardian care, which they 
could not do without knowing their names, places of abode, &amp;c. To their 
number, eleven more were soon added; and with these they afterwards held 
frequent meetings, for the purpose of informing their minds, and encouraging 
them to faithfulness in their attachment to the Redeemer. Among the last number 
was Taaroarii, the young chief of Huahine and Sir Charles&#150; 107 &#150; 
Sanders' Island, and Matapuupuu, a principal Areoi, and chief priest of 
Huahine, who had long been one of the main pillars of idolatry in the island to 
which he belonged.<br>
<br>
 On the 28th of July, 1813, a number of Areois 
visited Taaroarii's encampment at Teataebua, five miles from Papetoai, the 
Missionary settlement; prepared an entertainment, invited him to attend, and, 
before it commened, were about to perform some heathen rites connected with the 
food they were to eat, and to deliver an oration, in which his rank, descent, 
and connexion with the gods by origin and family, and his future place among 
them, were to have been detailed. This, Taaroarii strictly prohibited; 
declaring that he intended no longer to acknowledge the gods of Tahiti, which 
were no gods; that no more ceremonies should be performed on his account, as he 
purposed to worship Jehovah, He was anxious to know more respecting God, and 
wished them also to hear about Him; and, therefore, sent a message to Mr. Nott, 
requesting him to come down, and preach to the people at his place of abode.<br>
<br> Mr. Nott gladly complied with his request, and, accompanied by Mr. 
Hayward, repaired a few days afterwards to his encampment. When they arrived at 
Tiataebua, Puru, the king of Huahine, and the chief of Eimeo, received them 
cordially; said his son Taaroarii wished to be instructed in the word of God, 
to learn about Jehovah and Jesus Christ, of whom he had so frequently heard 
Pomare speak. The chief added, that although he had no desire after these 
things himself, he did not wish to oppose his son, or prevent his hearing 
whatever Mr. Nott might have to communicate. The hand of the Almighty was 
strikingly exhibited,&#150; 108 &#150; in the door thus effectually opened for 
the preaching of the gospel. Puru and his adherents had not been much with the 
Missionaries. The people of Huahine and their chief were certainly among the 
most superstitious and idolatrous tribes of the Pacific. Pomare, and not the 
Missionary, had on this occasion been employed as the agent, under God, in 
influencing the mind of the young chief, who was likely to become the king of 
Huahine and Eimeo, and in a way which at once demonstrated that it was the 
purpose of God that he he should be made acquainted with divine truth. Hence he 
was induced to prohibit an acknowledgement to the gods of his ancestors, and to 
invite the teachers of Christianity to his camp, to speak unto him and his 
adherents words whereby they might be saved. While the Missionaries admired the 
means by which God had thus shewn them that the work was His, and not theirs, 
and thus deprived them of attributing any thing to their own influence, they 
rejoiced in the opportunity now afforded of proclaiming the glad tidings of 
mercy from the most High. Mr. Nott conversed a long time with them, and 
preached an instructive and affecting discourse from<i>Isa</i>. xlix. 6,7. I 
have often heard the young man's mother-in-law, and other members of the 
household, speak of this discourse as having deeply impressed their minds. When 
Mr. Nott left them, he invited the chief and his adherents to visit the station 
on the Sabbath, and cultivate an intercourse with other Christian chiefs.<br>

<br> On the following Sabbath, Taaroarii attended; his father also became, a 
few months afterwards, a sincere convert. They accompanied us to Huahine in 
1818. Taaroarii died rather suddenly&#150; 109 &#150; in 1821. His father is 
the venerable king of Huahine; and has, ever since his return, proved not only 
a father to the people, but a uniform and bright ornament to the religion of 
the Cross.<br>
<br>
 Besides these regular periods of instructions and times of 
public worship, the Missionaries frequently held special meetings with those 
whose names they had written down, for the purpose of unfolding more fully the 
sublime doctrines of revelation, and uniting with them in social worship. They 
had the delightful satisfaction of hearing some of the new converts engage in 
prayer, and were surprised and gratified, in a high degree, with their fluency 
and fervour, as well as the appropriateness of their language, when officiating 
in this sacred duty. They also learned with pleasure, that they were accustomed 
to retire morning and evening for secret prayer.<br>
<br>
 In one of the visits 
which Mr. Nott made to the residence of Taaroarii, for the purpose of preaching 
to this people, he was followed by Patii, the priest of the temple in Papetoai, 
the district in which the Missionaries resided. This individual appeared to 
listen most attentively to what was said; and after the conclusion of the 
service, he and Mr. Nott, proceeded together along the beach towards the 
settlement. As they walked, Patii fully disclosed the fellings of his mind to 
Mr. Nott, and assured him that on the morrow, at a certain hour, he would bring 
out the idols under his care, and publicly burn them. The declaration was 
astounding; it was too decisive and important in its nature, and promised 
results almost too momentous to be true. Mr. Nott replied, &#147;I fear you are 
jesting with me, and stating what you think we wish, rather than what you 
intend. I can scarcely&#150; 110 &#150; allow myself to believe what you 
say.&#148; &#147;Don't be unbelieving,&#148; replied Patii, &#147;wait till 
tomorrow, and you shall see.&#148; The religion of Jesus Christ was the topic 
of conversation until they reached the settlement; when Patii took his leave, 
and Mr. Nott informed his colleagues of the success of his visit to the young 
chief of Huahine, and the determination which the priest of the district had 
made known to him. The impression which the intelligence of these events 
produced upon their minds, was that of mingled admiration, gratitude, and hope, 
to a degree that may be better imagined than expressed.<br>
<br>
 The arrival 
of the evening of the following day was awaited with an unusual agitation and 
excitement of feeling. Hope and fear alternately pervaded the minds of the 
Missionaries and their pupils, with regard to the burning of the idols, and the 
consequent tumult, devastation, and bloodshed that might follow. The public 
adherents of Christianity were but few, (less than fifty,) and surrounded by 
jealous and cruel idolaters&#151;who already began to wonder &#147;whereunto 
this thing might grow.&#148; Patii, however, was faithful to his word. He, with 
his friends, had collected a quantity of fuel near the sea-beach; and, in the 
afternoon, the wood was split, and piled on a point of land in the western part 
of Papetoai, near the large national<i>marae</i>, or temple, in which he had 
officiated. The report of his intention had spread among the people of the 
district, and multitudes assembled to witness this daring act of impiety, or 
the sudden vengeance which they expected would fall upon the sacrilegious 
criminal. The Missionaries and their friends also attended. The varied emotions 
of hope and fear, of dread and expectation, with a&#150; 111 &#150; strange air 
of mysterious foreboding, agitating the bosoms of the multitude, were strongly 
marked in the countenances of the spectators; resembling, perhaps in no small 
degree, the feeling depicted in the visages of the assembled Israelites, when 
the prophet Elijah summoned them to prove the power of Baal, or to acknowledge 
the omnipotence of the Lord God of Israel. A short time before sun-set, Patii 
appeared, and ordered his attendants to apply fire to the pile. This being 
done, he hastened to the sacred depository of his gods, brought them out, not 
indeed as he had been on some occasions accustomed to do, that they might 
receive the blind homage of the waiting populace,&#151;but to convince the 
deluded multitude of the impotency and the vanity of the objects of their 
adoration and their dread. When he approached&#150; 112 &#150; the burning 
pile, he laid them down on the ground. They were small carved wooden images, 
rude imitations of the human figure; or shapeless logs of wood, covered with 
finely braided and curiously wrought cinet of cocoa-nut fibres, and ornamented 
with red feathers. The representations in the preceding page will convey some 
idea of the shape and appearance of the former kind.<br>
<br>
<br>
 Patii tore 
off the sacred cloth in which they were enveloped, to be safe from the gaze of 
vulgar eyes; stripped them of their ornaments, which he cast into the fire; and 
then one by one threw the idols themselves into the crackling 
flames&#151;sometimes pronouncing the name and pedigree of the idol, and 
expressing his own regret at having worshipped it&#151;at others, calling upon 
the spectators to behold their inability even to help themselves. Thus were the 
idols which Patii, who was a powerful priest in Eimeo, had worshipped, publicly 
destroyed. The flames became extinct, and the sun cast his last beams, as he 
sunk behind the western wave, upon the expiring embers of that fire, which had 
already mingled with the earth upon which had been kindled, the ashes of some 
of the once obeyed and dreaded idols of Eimeo.<br>
<br>
 Patii on this occasion 
was not prompted by a spirit of daring bravado, but by the conviction of truth, 
deeply impressed upon his heart, and a desire to undeceive his deluded 
countrymen; probably considering, that as his conduct and instruction had 
heretofore done much to extend and propagate the influence of idolatry, so his 
thus publicly abandoning it, and exposing himself to all the consequences of 
their dreaded ire, would most effectually weaken their confidence in the gods, 
and lead them to desire instruction concerning&#150; 113 &#150; that Being, 
who, he was convinced, was the only living and true God,&#151;who was a spirit, 
and was to be worshipped, not with human or other sacrifices, save those of a 
broken heart and a contrite spirit, or the sacrifices of thanksgiving and of 
praise.<br>
<br>
 Although many of the spectators undoubtedly viewed Patii with 
feelings analogous to those with which the Melitians viewed the apostle Paul 
when the viper fastened on his hand, and were, many of them, evidently 
disappointed when they saw no evil befal him, they did not attempt to rescue 
the gods, when insulted, and perhaps riven by the axe, or stripped to be cast 
into the flames. No tumult followed, and no one came forward to revenge the 
insult offered to the tutelar deities of their country. Probably, 
Gamaliel-like, they thought it best not to interfere at that time, as their 
belief in the power of the gods had hitherto remained unshaken, and they 
doubtless expected that, in their own way, the gods would take signal vengeance 
on those by whom, in the sight of the nation, they had been thus dishonoured.
<br> <br>
 The watchful providence of God, over His infant cause in these 
islands, was remarkably conspicuous in preserving Patii and his friends, and 
allowing them, after the events of the evening, safely and peacefully to 
retire. There were many present, who were indignant at the insult, and filled 
with rage at the impiety of the act, as well as convinced, that if this conduct 
should be imitated by others, not only would their craft and their emoluments 
be endangered, but they would no longer be able to exercise that unquestioned 
influence over the people, to which they had hitherto been accustomed; nor to 
indulge their&#150; 114 &#150; base propensities, and live in the luxurious 
ease they then enjoyed. Had any popular tumult followed this heroic act, the 
idolaters were so numerous and powerful, and the Christians so weak, that their 
destruction would have been inevitable; and even the lives of the Missionaries, 
who would have been considered as the cause of all the disturbances, might not 
have been secure. God, however, preserved them, and they returned, to render to 
him the thanks and the glory due unto his name.<br>
<br>
 The conduct of Patii, 
when it became more extensively known, produced the most decisive effects on 
priests and people. Numbers in Tahiti and Eimeo were emboldened, by his 
example&#151;not only in burning their idols, but demolishing their<i>maraes</i>
 or temples; their altars were also stripped and overthrown, and the wood 
employed in their construction converted into fuel, and used in the native 
kitchens.<br>
<br>
 Patii became a pupil of the Missionaries, and a constant 
worshipper of the true God, persevering amidst much ridicule and persecution. 
Whether his mind had at this time undergone a divine and decisive change, it is 
not necessary now to inquire; every evidence that could be required, has since 
been given, of the sincerity of his profession of Christianity, and the 
influence of its principles on his heart. His conduct, from this period, has 
been uniformly moral and upright, his mind humble, his disposition affectionate 
and mild, and his habits of life reformed and industrious. The influence of his 
character in Papetoai, where he is best known, has occasioned his election to 
an important office in the Christian church. He is a valuable and steady 
friend, and an assistant, in&#150; 115 &#150; whom the Missionaries can repose 
confidence. Although not a chief of the highest rank, he had been raised by the 
king and people to the office of a magistrate, in his own district. His conduct 
on the above occasion gave idolatry a stab more deadly than any which it had 
before received, and inflicted a wound, from which, with all the energy 
subsequently manifested, it never could recover.<br>
<br>
 On the 5th of 
October, 1813, the native Christians engaged for the first time with their 
teachers, in the monthly meetings for prayer for the spreading of the gospel. 
On the 2nd of December, in the same year, Mui, one of the early scholars, and 
one whose name had been written among the first that professed Christianity, 
departed to the world of spirits, under the consolation that pure religion 
imparts in the hour of death. He was often heard to say, while confined to his 
couch, when he saw his former companions going to the school, or the place of 
worship, &#147;My feet cannot follow, but my heart goes with you.&#148; He did 
not pretend to know much, but he knew that he was a sinner, and that Jesus 
Christ came into the world to save sinners, and this knowledge removed from his 
mind the fear of death.<br>
<br>
 Early in the same year, the number of pupils, 
and of those who professed Christianity in Eimeo, was considerably increased, 
and favourable intelligence continued to arrive from the adjacent island.<br>

<br> The report of the increase of the Christians, and their advancement in 
knowledge, &amp;c. had already circulated throughout Tahiti; the minds of many 
were unsettled, and numbers were halting between two opinions. Upaparu, a chief 
of rank and influence&#150; 116 &#150; in the eastern part of Tahiti, with his 
wife, and twelve or thirteen of his people, came over to Eimeo, in order to 
receive instruction. The inhabitants of the Leeward Islands, whose encampment 
he passed when on his way to Papetoai, strongly persuaded him to join their 
party, and carry the flag of the gods to Raiatea, entreating him to adhere to 
the religion of his fathers, and to beware of Matapuupuu, a man of influence, 
an Areoi, and a high-priest, from Huabine, who had recently joined the 
Christian converts, and Utami, a well-informed and enterprising man, chief in 
the island of Tahaa, who, with his wife, had also attached himself to their 
number.<br>
<br>
 Fifty had now given in their names, as having renounced 
idolatry, desiring to acknowledge Jehovah alone as God, and to be instructed in 
the obedience his word required. Others attended in such numbers, that it was 
found necessary to enlarge the first place of worship they had ever used in the 
islands. The converts were punctual and regular in their observance of the 
outward ordinances of religion, in frequent social meetings for prayer, and 
seasons of retirement for private devotion. Their whole moral conduct seemed 
changed; the things they once delighted in, they now abhorred, and found 
enjoyment in what had formerly been a source of ridicule or aversion. Their 
habit of invariably asking a blessing, and returning thanks at their meals, and 
their frequent attention to prayer, attracted the notice of their countrymen, 
and procured for them, as a term of reproach from their enemies, the 
designation of Bure Atua, literally, Prayers to God; from Bure, to pray, and 
Atua, God; the meaning of which was, the people who prayed to God, or the 
praying people. Bure&#150; 117 &#150; Atua is a designation in no respect 
dishonourable to those to whom it was applied, and of which they have never 
been ashamed, though considered as an epithet of contempt or opprobrium, and 
applied in a manner similar to that in which the term Saint or Methodist is 
used in the present day, or the designation of Nazarene or Christian was given 
to the first disciples. Since the profession of Christianity has become 
general, it has been much less used than formerly.<i>Haapii parau</i>, 
learners, or brethren, friends, and disciples, are the terms most frequently 
employed by the converts themselves.<br>
<br>
 On the 16th of January, 1814, 
Idia, the king's mother, died. Like her husband, she had been uniformly 
friendly to the Missionaries, but continued to the last an enemy to the 
Christian faith. Two months afterwards Mr. Nott, accompanied by Mr. Hayward, 
visited Huahine, Raiatea, and Tahaa, the principal of the Society Islands, 
conversing with the inhabitants, travelling round the islands, and preaching to 
the people wherever it was convenient. In every place they were welcomed and 
entertained with hospitality. The inhabitants frequently assembled to hear 
their instructions as soon as they knew of their arrival in a district or 
village; whereas, on every former occasion, it had required much time and 
labour, by personal application, to assemble the smallest congregations. Many 
appeared to listen with earnestness and satisfaction to the message they 
delivered, called God, the good Spirit, and scrupled not to designate their own 
gods as<i>varua maamaa</i>, and <i>varua ino</i>, foolish spirits, and evil 
spirits.<br>
<br>
 In the autumn of the same year, Mr. Wilson went on board a 
vessel at Eimeo, which was driven&#150; 118 &#150; to the Leeward Islands, 
where contrary winds detained him and his companions for three months. During 
this period he was much among the people, preached to attentive congregations 
on the Sabbath and other days, and was happy to find that those whose names had 
been written down at Tahiti continued stedfast. He also added to their number 
thirty-nine others, whose names, at their own desire, were recorded as the 
professed worshippers of the true God. When he left them, they expressed the 
deepest regret, and requested that one of the Missionaries would come and 
reside among them. Pomare was also on board the same vessel when it was driven 
from the shores of Eimeo, and exerted his influence to persuade the people of 
the Leeward Islands to embrace the Christian religion.<br>
<br>
 Before Mr Nott 
visited the Society Islands, he finished the translation of the Gospel of Luke; 
and, in the course of the same year, the Missionaries sent a copy of their 
catechism to New South Wales, to be printed there. They were exceedingly 
anxious to obtain a supply of elementary books, as the spelling books from 
England were expended, and the desire for instruction had increased to such a 
degree, that upwards of two hundred scholars attended their school at Papetoai.
<br> <br>
 About this time, several of the chiefs of Raiatea, &amp;c. and many 
of their adherents, who had come up in 1811 to assist Pomare in the recovery of 
his government and authority in Tahiti, returned to their own islands; not, 
however, without most earnestly requesting the Missionaries to send them 
teachers and books.<br>
<br>
 Tamatoa and his brother, with other chiefs, had 
been residing for some time at the Missionary&#150; 119 &#150; station in 
Eimeo; they had attended the school and public instruction in the place of 
worship; and several, among the most promising of whom was Paumoana, at present 
a valuable native Missionary in the Hervey islands, appeared to be under the 
decisive influence of Christian principles.<br>
<br>
 After an absence of two 
years, during which he had resided in Tahiti, vainly expecting the restoration 
of his government, and endeavouring to recover his authority in his hereditary 
dominions, Pomare returned to Eimeo in the autumn of 1814, accompanied by a 
large train of adherents and dependants, all professors, at least, of 
Christianity. These regularly attended the school, and increased the 
congregation to such a degree, that it was necessary again to enlarge the place 
of worship. The king had been unable to withstand the temptation with which he 
had been assailed at Tahiti, to use ardent spirits; and although not addicted 
to entire intoxication, yet it induced the Missionaries to fear that he, like 
Agrippa, was but almost a Christian. They could not but indulge unfavourable 
apprehensions on his account; yet, considering his previous habits, that 
intemperance had ever been the vice to which he was most addicted, and the 
peculiar temptations to which his residence in Tahiti had exposed him, they 
could not readily relinquish the hopes they had entertained respecting him.<br>

<br> The numerous attendance and increasing earnestness of the people, induced 
the Missionaries to meet them for Divine worship twice on the Lord's day, and 
once during the week. In addition to these public instructions, they held a 
meeting every Sabbath evening with those whose names had been written down as 
the disciples of Christ, and spent much time in more private endeavours to 
direct&#150; 120 &#150; the views, and confirm the belief, of those who were 
desirous to be added to their number. These sacred exercises were enlivened by 
the natives, who united with their teachers in celebrating the praises of 
Jehovah, a number of the natives having been taught to sing hymns that had been 
composed in the native language. The Missionaries had often, with mingled 
feelings of horror and pity, heard their songs of licentiousness or of war, as 
well as the cantillations of their heathen worship, and their songs in honour 
of their idols; and it is scarcely possible to form an adequate idea of the 
delightful transport with which, at first, they must have heard the high 
praises of the Almighty preferred by native voices.<br>
<br>
 Upaparu, a 
principal chief in the eastern part of Tahiti, came over to Eimeo for the 
express purpose of seeking Christian instruction, and attending the assemblies 
for public worship. He was accompanied by his wife, Maihota, and twelve of his 
people, equally anxious with himself, to know more respecting these important 
matters. On the 15th of April they reached the Missionary station. The 
following day was the Sabbath. They attended public worship in the forenoon; 
and when they saw the congregation stand up, and heard them sing the praises of 
Jehovah in their native tongue, they were for some time mute with astonishment, 
and some of them so deeply affected, as to be unable to refrain from tears. An 
excellent discourse was afterwards delivered by Mr. Scott, to which they 
listened with mingled feelings of wonder and delight.<br>
<br>
 A variety of 
events occurred at this time, to confirm the attachment of those who had 
professed themselves favourable to Christianity, and to induce those who were 
undecided to join&#150; 121 &#150; them. On one occasion, a family in Eimeo 
were plunged into great distress, on account of the sufferings of one of its 
members, and the prospect of a fatal issue. A priest was sent for, who implored 
the assistance of his god; but, continuing his intercession for a long time, 
without any apparent relief to the sufferer, he desisted, and left the family 
in hopeless disappointment. A native, who was a worshipper of Jehovah, was 
among the attending friends. He kneeled down, and offered up a fervent prayer 
to the true God. While he was thus engaged, relief was afforded, and the 
weeping and forebodings of the family turned into grateful wonder, and joyous 
gratulations.32a I simply state the fact, as it is recorded by the Missionary 
in the island at the time, without making any comment; which, indeed, it 
neither requires nor admits. On the minds of the family, and the inhabitants of 
the place, it produced a powerful impression. They hastened to the idol temple 
of the district, which they demolished, breaking down the altars, and bringing 
forth their gods, which they execrated as false, and publicly committed to the 
flames.<br>
<br>
 A similar instance occurred early in this year. One of the 
scholars, the wife of an Areoi, who had for some time, with her husband's 
consent, attended the school, was suddenly taken ill. The members of the family 
were alarmed; and, accustomed to attribute every calamity to the anger of&#150; 
122 &#150; the gods, immediately concluded that her illness was occasioned by 
their displeasure, which she had probably incurred by attending the school and 
the Christian worship of the Missionaries. Patii, the priest of the district, 
was instantly sent for. On his arrival, a small pig and a young plantain were 
procured, and handed to Patii; who, in offering them to his god, thus addressed 
him:<i>O Satani! eiaha oe e riri, faaora, faaora, Teie te hapa, ua faarue ia 
oe, ua haavarehia e te papaa, Teie te buaa, eiaha e riri</i>; &#147;O Satan ! 
be not angry, restore, restore; this is the sin, deceived by the foreigners 
(she) has forsaken you. Here is a pig (as an atonement,) be not angry.&#148; In 
this address it is singular to notice the application of the term Satan to the 
god Patii invoked. It was introduced by the Missionaries, and at this time 
adopted by the Christians, when speaking of any of the idols of Tahiti. 
Although dangerously ill at the time these efforts were made, the woman 
recovered, and, notwithstanding all the fearful representation of consequences, 
made by her friends, attended the school again, so soon as her strength 
admitted. Her infatuation, as they conceived it to be in this respect, not only 
encouraged her school-fellows, but, with other circumstances which occurred 
about the same time, made a considerable impression on the minds of the 
idolaters, and occasioned some of the priests publicly to declare their 
conviction &#147;that the religion of the foreigners would prevail, in spite of 
all opposition.&#148;<br>
<br>
 The progress of Divine truth was so rapid among 
the natives, that, in the close of 1814, not fewer than 300 hearers regularly 
attended the preaching of the gospel. Upwards of 200 had given in their names, 
as professors of Christianity. Three hundred&#150; 123 &#150; scholars attended 
the means of instruction in Eimeo; besides which, there were a number in Sir 
Charles Sander's Island, Huahine, and Raiatea; so that, at this time there is 
reason to believe that between five and six hundred had renounced idolworship.
<br> <br>
 These encouraging appearances, in regard to the affairs of the 
Christians, only appeared to arouse the anger of their idolatrous enemies, who 
were no longer satisfied with simply ridiculing, and treating with contempt, 
the objects of their hatred, but proceeded to more alarming plans of resistance 
against the progress of the new principles which were daily gaining ground 
among the people. It was by no means an uncontested triumph, nor an undisputed 
possession, that Christianity acquired in those islands; every inch was 
reluctantly surrendered; and, at several periods, persecution raged, amid the 
Elysian bowers of Tahiti and Eimeo, as much as ever it had done in the valleys 
of Piedmont, or the metropolis of the Roman empire. Many, in Tahiti especially, 
were plundered of their property, banished from their homes and their 
possessions; their houses were burnt, and they themselves hunted for sacrifices 
to be offered to Oro, merely because they were Bure Atua, prayers to God. In 
some places, the persecutions were so inveterate as to produce remonstrances, 
even from several of the inferior chiefs, who were themselves idolaters.<br>

<br> The commencement of the year 1815 is distinguished, in the annals of 
Tahiti, by changes in society, affecting deeply, not only the religious, but 
the domestic condition of the people, especially of the females. Idolatry had 
exerted all its withering and deadly influence, not only over every&#150; 124 
&#150; moment of their earthly existence, but every department of life, 
destroying, by its debasing and unsocial dictates, every tender feeling, and 
all the enjoyments of domestic intercourse.<br>
<br>
 To this cheerless 
humiliation, the female sex had been for ages subject, from the direct 
injunctions of their false system of religion; and as its cumbrous fabric began 
to give way, this barbarous and arbitrary imposition was proportionably 
disregarded. Not only were the sacred materials with which the altars, and the 
appendages of the temple, had been constructed, converted into fuel; but the 
food, considered sacred, was esteemed so no longer, the invidious and debasing 
distinctions attached to the females were removed, and both sexes, among those 
who professed Christianity, sat down together to their cheerful meal.<br>
<br>
 
Under the influence of these encouraging prospects, although enfeebled by 
frequent indisposition, the Missionaries prosecuted their work; their scholars 
increased in the same degree that the profession of Christianity prevailed, and 
a supply of four hundred copies of their abridgment of the New Testament, and a 
thousand copies of small elementary books, which had been printed in New South 
Wales, arrived very opportunely about this time; spelling books they were still 
much in want of, as those formerly printed in England had long been expended.
<br> <br>
 Such was the pleasing state of things in the commencement of 1815. 
The importance and advantages of education appeared to be more extensively 
appreciated, and between forty and fifty, principally adults, regularly 
attended the Mission school. The agents of vice, idolatry, and cruelty, were 
not inactive. The struggle between&#150; 125 &#150; light and darkness, truth 
and error, order and anarchy, benevolence and barbarism, had never appeared 
more intense and conspicuous than at this time. The little band of scholars in 
the Mission school, and worshippers in the chapel, unwilling to enjoy their 
privileges alone, employed every proper and persuasive means to induce their 
friends and relatives to attend to these things; at least to make a trial of 
the school, and to hear what was said about the true God. The latter, however, 
frequently became indignant at the very proposal, charging the God of the 
foreigners with all the maladies under which they suffered, and the 
disturbances that agitated the country; accusing them also of bringing down the 
vengeance of their own gods upon the family, by deserting their altars, and 
worshipping with the strangers. Frequently, however, they answered their 
entreaties only with ridicule and scorn, tauntingly inquiring, Where is the 
good of which you speak so much&#151;the salvation of which you tell us? the 
foreigners themselves die, their pupils die, or suffer the same pain that we 
do; and what good have you derived from going to their schools? Let us 
see&#151;if you go this week, and bring home a good bundle of cloth, or 
scissors, or knives, or any thing else worth having, then we will go too; if 
not, we will have nothing to do with such profitless work. The state of things 
resembled greatly that described by the Saviour, when speaking of the results 
that should follow the promulgation of his gospel. In many a family, the 
husband was an idolater, and the wife a Christian,&#151;or the reverse; the 
parents addicted to the gods of their ancestors, and the child a disciple of 
Jesus Christ; and many a wife was beaten by her husband, and &#150; 126 &#150; 
many a child driven from the parental roof, solely on account of their 
attachment to the new religion. In Tahiti, the idolaters proceeded to the 
greatest acts of lawless violence and horrid murder.<br>
<br>
 More than once, 
individuals were selected to be offered in sacrifice to the gods, only because 
they were Christians. Mr. Davies, in his journey round Tahiti, in 1816, met 
with the murderer of the young man who was offered in sacrifice by the people 
of Taiarabu, to insure success in their last attack upon the people of Atehuru 
and Papara, and whose tragical death, he justly considered, ought to be 
recorded, because it is hoped it was &#147;the last human sacrifice offered in 
Tahiti,&#148; and because the victim was selected &#147;on account of his 
attachment to Christianity.&#148;<br>
<br>
 Aberahama, an interesting and 
intelligent young man, who was a pupil in our school at Eimeo, was marked out 
as a victim; and, when the servants of the priests came to take him, being 
obliged to fly for his life, he was pursued by the murderers, shot at, wounded, 
and but narrowly escaped. When he received the ball, he fell, and, unable to 
save himself by flight, crawled among the bushes, and hid himself so 
completely, as to elude the vigilant search of his enemies, although it was 
continued for some time, and they often passed near his retreat. Under cover of 
the darkness of night, he crept down to the dwelling of his friends, who 
dressed his wound, and conveyed him to a place of safety. But, although he 
recovered from the shot, and lives, not only to enjoy the blessings of the 
gospel in this world, and to be useful in imparting its benefits to others, he 
will, to adopt the language of Mr. Davies, &#147;carry the honourable scar to 
his grave.&#148;</p> 
<p>&#150; 127 &#150;</p> 
<p>An immolation, equally affecting, was related to me by Mr. Nott. A fine, 
intelligent young man, on becoming a disciple of Christ, and a public 
worshipper of Jehovah, was ridiculed by his family; this proving ineffectual, 
flattering promises were made of temporal advantages, if he would again unite 
with those who had been his former associates in idol worship; these he also 
declined. He then was threatened with all their weight of vengeance; and, still 
remaining firm to his determination, he was banished from his father's house, 
and forced to leave the neighbourhood. Not satisfied with this, that rage and 
malignant hatred of Christianity, which is gendered by ignorance and idolatry, 
and cherished by satanic infatuation, pursued him still. A heathen ceremony was 
at hand, for which a human victim was required, and this young man was selected 
by his persecutors, because he professed to be a worshipper of the true God. A 
more acceptable sacrifice they thought they could not offer, as the revenge 
they should thereby wreak upon him, would not only gratify their own insatiate 
malice, but be so acceptable to the gods whom he had rejected, as certainly to 
render them propitious. It is probable they also expected, by this summary 
vengeance, to deter others from following his example. On the evening of the 
day preceding that on which the ceremony was to take place, the young man, as 
his custom was, had retired to the brow of a hill that overlooked the valley 
where he dwelt; and there, seated beneath the embowering shade of an elegant 
clump of trees, was absorbed in meditation, previous to offering up his evening 
supplications to his God. While thus engaged, his seclusion was invaded, and 
his solitude disturbed, by the&#150; 128 &#150; appearance of a band, similar, 
in some respects, to that which broke in upon the Saviour's retirement in 
Gethsemane. A number of the servants of the priests and chiefs approached the 
young man, and told him that the king had arrived, and, wishing to see him, had 
sent them to invite him down. He knew of the approaching ceremony, that a human 
sacrifice was then to be offered,&#151;and he no sooner saw them advancing to 
his retreat, than a sudden thought, like a flash of lightning, darted through 
his mind, intimating that he was to be the victim. He received it as a 
premonition of his doom; and, in reply to the request, told them, calmly, that 
he did not think the king had arrived, and that, therefore, it was unnecessary 
for him to go down. They then told him that the priest, or some of his friends, 
wished to see him, and again invited him to descend. &#147;Why,&#148; said he, 
&#147;do you thus seek to deceive me? The priest, or friends, may wish to see 
me, but it is under very different circumstances from what your message would 
imply: I know a ceremony approaches, that a human victim is then to be 
offered&#151;something within tells me I am to be that victim, and your 
appearance and your message confirms my conviction. Jesus Christ is my keeper, 
without his permission you cannot harm me; you may be permitted to kill my 
body, but I am not afraid to die! My soul you cannot hurt; that is safe in the 
hands of Jesus Christ, by whom it will be kept beyond your power.&#148; 
Perceiving there was but little prospect of inducing him, by falsehood, to 
accompany them towards the beach, and irritated, probably, by his heroical 
reply, they rushed upon him, wounded, and murdered him, and then, in a long 
basket made with the leaves of the overshadowing cocoanut&#150; 129 &#150; 
tree, bore his body to the temple, where, with exultation, it was offered in 
sacrifice to their god They had, perhaps, beheld, with fiend-like joy, his 
writhing agonies in death, and listened with equal delight to his expiring 
groans. The unconscious earth had been saturated with his blood; and, when they 
placed his body on the rude altar, or suspended it from the sacred tree, in the 
presence of their god, they not only supposed they offered a sacrifice at once 
acceptable and efficacious, but, doubtless, viewed the immolation as one by 
which they had achieved for idolatry a triumph over humanity and Christian 
principle. Before, however, these feelings could be exercised, and the earth 
had drunk up his blood, or his insulted corpse was deposited on their altar, 
his liberated and ransomed spirit had winged its way to the realms of 
blessedness, had joined &#147;the noble army of martyrs;&#148; and united in 
ascriptions of grateful homage unto Him who had loved him, and not only made 
him faithful to the end, but triumphant over death. Those who heard the young 
man's dying words, and witnessed his calm unshaken firmness in the moment of 
trial, with many, among whom the report circulated, were probably led to think 
differently of the religion he professed, than they had done before. The blood 
of the martyrs has ever been the seed of the church; and, from an exhibition of 
principles so unequivocal in their nature, and so happy in their effects, it is 
not too much to presume that it proved so on the present occasion.</p>

</i> <br>
 The anarchy, crime, and wretchedness, which now 
desolated Tahiti, were increased by intemperance, which at this time prevailed 
to an awful and unprecedented degree. By the Sandwich Islanders, who had 
arrived some years before, the natives had been taught to distil ardent spirits 
from the saccharine<i>ti</i> root, which they now practised to a great extent; 
and exhibited, in a proportionate degree, all the demoralizing and debasing 
influence of drunkenness.<br>
<br>
 Whole districts frequently united, to erect 
what might be termed a public still. It was a rude, unsightly machine, yet it 
answered but too well the purpose for which it was made. It generally consisted 
of a large fragment of rock, hollowed in a rough manner, and fixed firmly upon 
a solid pile of stones, leaving a space underneath for a fire-place.</p> 
<p>&#150; 131 &#150; The but-end of a tree was then hollowed out, and placed 
upon the rough stone boiler for a cap. The baked<i>ti</i> root, called <i>
Dracan&aelig; terminalis</i>, macerated in water, and already in a state of 
fermentation, was then put into the hollow stone, and covered with the unwieldy 
cap. The fire was kindled underneath; a hole was made in the wooden cap of the 
still, into which a long, small, bamboo cane, placed in a trough of cold water, 
was inserted at one end, and, when the process of distillation was commenced, 
the spirit flowed from the other into a calabash, cocoa-nut shell, or other 
vessel, placed underneath to receive it.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>When the materials were prepared, the man and boys of the district 
assembled in a kind of temporary house, erected over the still, in order to 
drink theava, as they called the spirit. The first that issued from the still 
being the strongest, they called the<i>ao</i>; it was carefully received, and 
given to the chief: that subsequently procured, was drunk by &#150; 132 &#150; 
the people in general. In this employment they were sometimes engaged for 
several days together, drinking the spirit as it issued from the still, sinking 
into a state of indescribable wretchedness, and often practising the most 
ferocious barbarities.<br>
<br>
 Travellers among the natives experienced 
greater inconvenience from these district stills than from any other cause, for 
when the people were either preparing one, or engaged in drinking, it was 
impossible to obtain either their attention, or the common offices of 
hospitality. Under the unrestrained influence of their intoxicating draught, in 
their appearance and actions they resembled demons more than human beings.<br>

<br> Sometimes, in a deserted still-house might be seen the fragments of the 
rude boiler, and the other appendages of the still, scattered in confusion on 
the ground; and among them the dead and mangled bodies of those who had been 
murdered with axes or billets of wood in the quarrels that had terminated their 
debauch.<br>
<br>
 It was not only among themselves that their unbridled 
passions led to such enormities. One or two European vessels were seized, and 
the crews inhumanly murdered. The first was the Queen Charlotte, of Port 
Jackson, the vessel by which we arrived in the islands.<br>
<br>
 Towards the 
autumn of 1813, Mr. Shelly, formerly a Missionary in Tongatabu, and 
subsequently in Matavai, arrived as master of the Queen Charlotte, at Eimeo, on 
his way to the Paumotu, or Pearl Islands. These lie to the eastward of Tahiti, 
and form what is denominated the Dangerous Archipelago. The vessel was but 
imperfectly manned, and a number of natives, of Raiatea and Tahiti, were taken 
on board, to dive among the lagoon&#150; 133 &#150; islands for the pearl 
oyster. They proceeded to their destination, but had scarcely commenced their 
pearl-fishing, when the natives attacked the crew, barbarously murdered the 
first and second officers, who were men of fine stature and benevolent 
dispositions; and killing one of the seamen, took possession of the ship. Mr. 
Shelly's life was threatened, and only spared at the instance of two Tahitians, 
who, anxious to save him, requested that he might be kept, to navigate the 
vessel to Tahiti, whither they intended to return. One of these natives was 
Upaparu, a chief of rank, present secretary to the government of Tahiti, and a 
steady friend to foreigners. When the vessel arrived at Tahiti, Pomare 
succeeded in securing to Mr. Shelly its restoration, though most of the 
property had been plundered. Matting was procured for sails, and the vessel, 
pursuing her homeward voyage, reached Port Jackson in safety.<br>
<br>
 Flushed 
with the success that had attended the savage and daring effort of the 
Raiateans, the Tahitians, whom Captain Fodger had employed on board his vessel 
the Daphne, for the purpose of diving among the pearl islands, rose upon the 
ship's company, murdered the captain and some of the men, took possession of 
the vessel, and brought her to Tahiti. Mr. G. Bicknell, a nephew of Mr. 
Bicknell, was on board at the time, but his life was spared, amidst the general 
carnage that attended the assault. The mutinous natives returned to their own 
island, but were met as they were about to enter the harbour by Capt. Walker of 
the Endeavour, who succeeded in retaking the vessel, and thus deprived them of 
their plunder.<br>
<br>
 These acts of daring outrage and appalling crime, on 
the one side, and of increasing and&#150; 134 &#150; decided attachment to the 
principles of order, humanity, and religion, on the other, seemed to indicate 
that matters in Tahiti were fast verging to an important issue, and that, 
before long, some violent convulsion in society must follow. The Missionaries 
could not view these things with in sensibility, as they saw what they had to 
except, should they fall into the hands of those who had been guilty of such 
wanton cruelty; their support was, however, derived from the conviction, that 
their God was governor among the nations, and that the Lord omnipotent reigned.
<br> <br>
 In the close of 1814, Pomare-vahine, the daughter of the king of 
Raiatea, and the sister of Pomare's queen, paid a visit to Eimeo, from the 
Leeward Islands, and in the month of May, 1815, made a voyage to Tahiti, in 
company with her sister the queen, and a numerous train of companions and 
attendants, most of whom professed to be Christians. Their object was to make 
the tour of Tahiti, with the visitor from the Leeward Islands. Previously, 
however, to their embarkation, a signal triumph was achieved in favour of 
Christianity, at a public festival, in which they were the most conspicuous 
party.<br>
<br>
 It has ever been considered a mark of respect due to every 
distinguished visitor, to prepare, soon after the arrival of such an 
individual, a sumptuous feast, termed by the natives a<i>faamuraa</i>, or 
feeding; not, however, by furnishing a rich and splendid entertainment at the 
habitation of the proprietors, and inviting as guests the parties in honour of 
whom it was prepared, but by cooking a number of whole pigs, fowls, and fish, 
with a proportionate accompaniment of vegetables, puddings, and what may be 
called their made-dishes, and&#150; 135 &#150; carrying the whole to the 
encampment of the visitor, with a considerable addition of the choicest fruits 
the season may afford.<br>
<br>
 An expensive and sumptuous entertainment of 
this kind was furnished by the chiefs of Eimeo for the queen's sister. A large 
quantity of every valuable kind of food was dressed and presented, together 
with several bundles of native cloth. On such occasions, it was customary for a 
priest or priests to attend; and before any of it was eaten, to offer the whole 
to the gods, by taking parts of the animals, and particular kinds of the fruit, 
to the temple, and depositing them upon the altar. The king and his friends 
were desirous on this occasion to prevent such an acknowledgment. When, 
therefore, the food was presented to Pomare-vahine, before any article was 
touched by the attendants, and while the spectators were expecting the priests 
to select the customary offerings to the idols, one of her principal men, who 
was a Christian, came forward, uncovered his head, and, looking up to heaven, 
offered in an audible voice their acknowledgments and thanksgivings to Jehovah, 
who liberally gave them food and raiment and every earthly blessing. The 
assembled multitude were confounded and astonished; and the food being, by this 
act, offered as they considered to Jehovah, no one dared to take any part of it 
to the idol temple.<br>
<br>
 When the party reached Tahiti, they landed in 
Pare, the hereditary district of Pomare's family, where they were welcomed by 
the friends of the king, and the guardian of Aimata, his only child, who with 
her nurse resided here.<br>
<br>
 From the few Christians in the neighbourhood, 
they were happy to learn that the inhabitants of&#150; 136 &#150; large 
sections of Pare, and the adjacent district of Matavai, the former residence of 
their teachers, had renounced idolatry, and were desirous to receive Christian 
instruction.<br>
<br>
 By the queen, or her sister, the king sent over a new 
book to Aimata, his infant daughter, which being considered as an indication of 
his purpose that she should be trained up in the new religion, was a source of 
great encouragement to the converts, and of corresponding dissatisfaction to 
the idolaters, who already began to meditate on the means of effecting the 
destruction of the Christians.<br>
<br>
 It was not in Pare and Matavai alone 
that the professed worshippers of God were to be found. Some openly avowed 
their attachment to the new order of things, maintaining, in the midst of the 
heathen around them, daily worship in their families, and morning and evening 
devotion in private; others, for fear of giving offence to their chiefs or 
neighbours, maintained secretly their profession, and at the hour of midnight 
met together, as the persecuted Christians in England have often formerly done, 
in the depths of the woods, or the retired glens of the valleys, for conference 
or social prayer.<br>
<br>
 The state of affairs in Tahiti was such, as to 
prevent the queen and her sister from proceeding on their intended tour of the 
island; but while they remained at Pare, a circumstance occurred similar to 
that which had transpired in Eimeo, though probably more decisive and important 
in its immediate result.<br>
<br>
 When a present of food and cloth was brought 
to the visitors by some of the chiefs of Tahiti, the priests also attended, 
and, observing the party disinclined to acknowledge or render the customary
&#150; 137 &#150; homage to the gods, began to expatiate on the power of the 
gods, and, pointing to some bunches of<i>uru</i>, or red feathers, which were 
always considered emblematical of their deities, employed insulting language, 
and threatened with vengeance the queen's companions. One of Pomare-vahine's 
men, the individual who had offered their acknowledgments to God, on the 
presentation of food in Eimeo, hearing this, and pointing to the feathers, 
said, &#147;Are those the mighty things you so extol, and with whose anger you 
threaten us? If so, I will soon convince you of their inability even to 
preserve themselves.&#148; Running at the same time to the spot where they were 
fixed, he seized the bunches of feathers, and cast them into a large fire close 
by, where they were instantly consumed. The people stood aghast, and uttered 
exclamations of horror at the sacrilegious deed; and it is probable that this 
act increased the hatred already rankling in the bosoms of the idolatrous party.
<br> <br>
 The individual who acted so heroic and conspicuous a part on these 
occasions was Farefau, a native of Borabora, but attached to the household of 
Pomare-vahine, with whom he had arrived from the Leeward Islands in 1814. When 
he reached Eimeo, he was an idolater, but soon became a pupil in the school; 
and, in the close of the same year, desired that this name might be recorded 
among the converts. He occupied a prominent station in all the struggles 
between paganism and Christianity; maintaining an unblemished character, and an 
unwavering profession, through the varied scenes of that unsettled period. He 
engaged with diligence in teaching the inhabitants of the remote and rocky 
parts of Taiarabu the catechism&#150; 138 &#150; and the art of reading; and 
after a lingering illness, during which he enjoyed the presence and support 
which true religion alone can impart, delivered, as he expressed himself on the 
last day of his life, from the fear of death, and having his hopes fixed or 
relying on the Son of God as the only Saviour, he died in peace, at our 
Missionary station in Afareaitu, on the 29th of July, 1817, nearly two years 
after the total overthrow of idolatry in 1815.<br>
<br>
 He was a man of 
decision and daring enterprise; and though, on the occasion in Tahiti above 
referred to, he may have acted with a degree of zeal somewhat imprudent, it was 
a zeal resulting, not from ignorant rashness, but enlightened principle, and 
holy indignation against the boasting threatening and lying vanities of the 
priests of idolatry; to whose arts of deception he had formerly been no 
stranger.<br>
<br>
 The influence of the Bure Atua in the nation, from the rank 
many of them held, and the confidence with which they maintained the 
superiority of their religion, together with the accessions that were daily 
made to their numbers from various parts of the island, not only increased the 
latent enmity against Christianity which the idolaters had always cherished, 
but awakened the first emotion of apprehension lest this new word should 
ultimately prevail, and the gods, their temples, and their worship, be 
altogether disregarded. To avoid this, they determined on the destruction, the 
total annihilation, of every one in Tahiti who was known to pray to Jehovah.<br>
<br> A project was formed by the pagan chiefs of Pare, Matavai, and Apaiano, to 
assassinate, in one night, every individual of the Bure Atua.</p> 
<p>&#150; 139 &#150; The persecuted party was already formidable in point of 
numbers and rank, and the idolaters, in order to ensure success in their 
murderous design, invited the chiefs of Atchuru and Papara to join them. The 
time was fixed for the perpetration of this bloody deed. At the hour of 
midnight they were to be attacked, their property plundered, their houses 
burnt, and every prisoner secured, to be slaughtered on the spot. The parties, 
who for a long time had been inveterate enemies to each other, readily agreeing 
to the proposed confederation, were made friends on the occasion, and cordially 
united in the plan of destroying the Christians. The intended victims of this 
treachery were unconscious of their danger, until the evening of the 7th of 
July; when, a few hours only before the horrid massacre was to have commenced, 
they received secret intelligence of the ruin that was ready to burst upon them.
<br> <br>
 Circumstances, unforeseen and uncontrollable by their enemies, had 
prevented the different parties from arriving punctually at their respective 
points of rendezvous; otherwise, even now escape would have been impracticable, 
and destruction inevitable, as the Porionu, inhabitants of Pare, Matavai, and 
Apaiano, would have been on the one side, and in their rear, and the party from 
Atehuru and Papara on the other. The delay in the arrival of some of these, 
afforded the only hope of deliverance.<br>
<br>
 At this remarkably critical 
period, the whole of the party having to attend a meeting either for public 
worship, or for some other general purpose, assembled in the evening near the 
sea. No time was to be lost. Their canoes were lying on the beach. They were 
instantly launched; and, hurrying&#150; 140 &#150; away what few things they 
could take, they embarked soon after sunset, and reached Eimeo in safety on the 
following morning, grateful for the happy and surprising deliverance they had 
experienced. The different parties, as they arrived towards midnight, learned, 
with no ordinary remorse and disappointment, that their prey had been alarmed, 
and had escaped.<br>
<br>
 A large body of armed and lawless warriors, 
belonging to different and rival chieftains, thus brought together under 
irritated feelings, and perhaps mutually accusing each other as the cause of 
their disappointment, were not long without a pretext for commencing the work 
of death among themselves. Ancient animosities, restrained only for the purpose 
of crushing what they considered a common enemy, were soon revived, and led to 
an open declaration of war between the tribes assembled. The inhabitants of 
Atehuru and Papara, who had been invited by the Porionu to join them in 
destroying the Bure Atua, attacked the Porionu; and, in the battle that 
followed, obtained a complete victory over them, killing one of their principal 
chiefs, and obliging the vanquished to seek their safety in flight.<br>
<br>
 
After this affair, the people of Taiarabu joined the victors. The whole island 
was again involved in war, and the conquering party scoured the coast from 
Atehuru to the eastern side of the isthmus, burning every house, destroying 
every plantation, plundering every article of property, and reducing the 
verdant and beautiful districts of Pare, Faaa, the romantic valleys of Hautaua, 
Matavai, and Apaiano, and the whole of the north-eastern part of the island, to 
a state of barrenness and desolation.<br>
<br>
 Success did not bring peace or 
rest to the victorious&#150; 141 &#150; party. Proud of their triumph, insolent 
in crime, and impatient of control, the Atehuruans and natives of Papara 
quarrelled with the Taiarabuans, who had joined them in destroying the Porionu. 
A battle followed. The natives of Taiarabu were defeated, and fled to their 
fortresses in the mountains of their craggy peninsula, leaving the Oropaa 
masters of the island.<br>
<br>
 Numbers of the vanquished fled to Eimeo, where 
they were received by the king, or protected by the chiefs, who had taken no 
part whatever in the wars that were now desolating Tahiti, and who determined 
to observe the strictest neutrality; or, if they acted at all, to do so only on 
the defensive, should invasion be attempted.<br>
<br>
 Besides the refugees, 
who in consequence of defeat in Tahiti had taken shelter in Eimeo, numbers who 
had secretly embraced Christianity, and feared ultimate destruction from the 
idolaters, although religion appeared to have no influence in the present 
commotion, came over to Eimeo, and joined the Christians. The aggregate of 
those whose names were written down as such, amounted at this period to nearly 
four hundred, and the pupils in the school were between six and seven hundred. 
Want of books alone prevented its being considerably enlarged.<br>
<br>
 
Notwithstanding the Bure Atua had escaped the machinations of their enemies, 
and the murderous counsel of the idolaters had issued in their own defeat, yet 
it was impossible, that, amidst the agitation which prevailed in Tahiti, the 
adjacent island of Eimeo should remain free from apprehension and disquiet; and 
although the king had sent repeated messages of a peaceable tendency to the 
conquerors, and had received assurances that&#150; 142 &#150; there was no 
feeling of hostility towards him and his adherents, yet they knew, by past 
experience, that no reliance was to be placed on such professions.<br>
<br>
 
When the queen went over to Tahiti, Pomare undertook a journey round Eimeo, 
purposing, by conversation with the chiefs of the different districts, to 
inform them of the nature of Christianity, endeavour to induce them to receive 
it, and recommend it to the people. He was at first ridiculed in this 
undertaking; for many of the chiefs and landed proprietors in Eimeo were not 
strongly attached to his family; they were, moreover, at that time the firm 
supporters of idolatry, and considered his neglect of the gods as the cause of 
his own troubles, and the war then desolating Tahiti. By some of the natives, 
this journey has been regarded as a measure of policy adopted by the king, to 
prevent the chiefs of the eastern part of Eimeo joining his enemies in Tahiti, 
and to attach them to his own interest. It has also been stated, that in his 
reception and treatment of the refugees, he was not acting more from the 
dictates of his own generosity, than from the suggestions of the chief heathen 
prophet of the nation, who had engaged, provided his advice was followed, to 
restore to him the dominion in Tahiti. This priest, it is stated by some of the 
natives, proposed to go to Tahiti to excite persecution against the Christians, 
and procure their banishment; then to stir up war among the idolatrous 
insurgents themselves, until their numbers should be so diminished as to render 
them unable to withstand the force which Pomare, by uniting the refugees with 
his adherents in Eimeo, and his auxiliaries from the Leeward Islands, might 
bring against them. By&#150; 143 &#150; whatever political considerations he 
may have been actuated, and whatever may have been the influence of Christian 
principles on his own mind, in this or subsequent periods of his life, Pomare 
certainly was convinced of the excellency of Christianity, and desirous to 
introduce it among his people, and was employed by the Almighty as an 
instrument most effectually to promote the important process, which was at this 
time changing altogether the moral and religious aspect of the nation. The 
success that attended his endeavours appears from a letter which he addressed 
to the Missionaries while in the district of Maatea. In this letter, he stated 
his delight in beholding the chiefs inclined to obey the word of God; which, he 
said, Jehovah himself was causing to grow, so that it prospered exceedingly. 
Thirty-four or thirty-six, in one district, had, to use his own expression, 
&#147;laid hold of the word of God.&#148;<br>
<br>
 At Maatea, the district 
from which the king wrote, ninety-six renounced idolatry while he was there, in 
addition to others who had done so before. The change appeared to be general 
here. The chiefs, priests, and people, publicly committed their idols to the 
flames, and attended public worship.<br>
<br>
 The Bure Atua had hitherto 
escaped the ruin intended for them by their enemies; and though these were 
masters of Tahiti, in Eimeo, and secretly in Tahiti, the number of those who 
had joined the Christians was greatly increased.</p>

<br>
 In the 
commencement of the year 1815, the affairs of Tahiti and Eimeo, in reference to 
the supremacy of Christianity or idolatry, were evidently tending to a crisis; 
and although the converts had carefully avoided all interference in the late 
wars which had desolated the larger island, they were convinced that the time 
was not very remote, when their faith and principles must rise pre-eminent 
above the power and influence of that system of delusion and crime, of which 
they had so long been the slaves, or plunge them in the deepest distress, and 
perhaps inevitable ruin. To maintain the Christian faith, and enjoy a 
continuance of their present peace and comfort, they foresaw would be 
impossible. Under the influence of these impressions, the 14th of July, 1815, 
was set apart&#150; 145 &#150; as a day of solemn fasting and prayer to God, 
whose guidance and protection was implored. A chastened and dependent frame of 
mind was very generally experienced at this period by the Christians, which led 
them to be prepared for whatever in the course of Divine providence might 
transpire.<br>
<br>
 Soon after this event, the pagan chiefs of Tahiti sent 
messengers to the refugees in Eimeo, inviting them to return, and re-occupy the 
lands they had deserted. This invitation they accepted; and, as the presence of 
the king was necessary in several of the usages and ceremonies observed on such 
occasions, Pomare went over about the same time, formally to reinstate them in 
their hereditary possessions. A large number of Pomare's adherents, who were 
professors of Christianity, and inhabitants of Huahine, Raiatea, Borabora, and 
Eimeo, with Pomare-vahine and Mahine, the chief of Eimeo and Huahine, 
accompanied the king and the refugees to Tahiti. When they approached the 
shores of this island, the idolatrous party appeared in considerable force on 
the beach, assumed a hostile attitude, prohibited their landing, and repeatedly 
fired upon the king's party. Instead of returning the fire, the king sent a 
flag of truce and a proposal of peace. Several messages were exchanged, and the 
negociations appeared to terminate in confidence and friendship. The king and 
his followers were allowed to land, and several of the people returned 
unmolested to their respective districts and plantations. Negociations for the 
adjustment of the differences that had existed between the king and his 
friends, and the idolatours chiefs, were for a time carried on, and at length 
arranged, apparently to the satisfaction&#150; 146 &#150; of the respective 
parties. The king, and those attached to his interest, were not however without 
suspicion, that it was only an apparent satisfaction; and they were not 
mistaken. The idolaters had indeed joined with them in binding the wreath of 
amity and peace, while they were at the same time secretly and actively 
concerting measures for their destruction.<br>
<br>
 The 12th of November, 
1815, was the most eventful day that had yet occurred in the history of Tahiti. 
It was the Sabbath. In the forenoon, Pomare, and the people who had come over 
from Eimeo, probably about eight hundred, assembled for public worship at a 
place called Narii, near the village of Bunaau&iuml;a, in the district of 
Atehuru. At distant points of the district, they stationed piquets; and when 
divine service was about to commence, and the individual who was to officiate 
stood up to read the first hymn, a firing of muskets was heard; and, looking 
out of the building in which they were assembled, a large body of armed men, 
preceded and attended by the flag of the gods, and the varied emblems of 
idolatry, were seen marching round a distant point of land, and advancing 
towards the place where they were assembled. It is war! It is war! was the cry 
which re-echoed through the place; as the approaching army were seen from 
different parts of the building. Many, agreeably to the precautions of the 
Missionaries, had met for worship under arms; others, who had not, were 
preparing to return to their tents, and arm for the battle. Some degree of 
confusion consequently prevailed. Pomare arose, and requested them all to 
remain quietly in their places; stating, that they were under the special 
protection of Jehovah, and had&#150; 147 &#150; met together for his worship, 
which was not to be forsaken or disturbed even by the approach of an enemy. 
Auna, formerly an Areoi and a warrior, now a Christian teacher, who was my 
informant on these points, then read the hymn, and the congregation sang it. A 
portion of scripture was read, a prayer offered to the Almighty, and the 
service closed. Those who were unarmed, now repaired to their tents, and 
procured their weapons.<br>
<br>
 In assuming the posture of defence, the 
king's friends formed themselves into two or three columns, one on the 
sea-beach, and the other at a short distance towards the mountains. Attached to 
Pomare's camp, was a number of refugees, who had, during the late commotions in 
Tahiti, taken shelter under his protection, but had not embraced Christianity; 
on these the king and his adherents placed no reliance, but stationed them in 
the centre, or the rear. The Bure Atua requested to form the<i>viro</i> or 
front line, advanced guard; and the<i>apoa viri</i>, or cheek of their forces; 
while the people of Eimeo, immediately in the rear, formed what they called the
<i>tapono</i>, or shoulder, of their army. In the front of the line, Auna, 
Upaparu, Hitote, and others equally distinguished for their steady adherence to 
the system they had adopted, took their station on this occasion, and shewed 
their readiness to lay down their lives rather than relinquish the Christian 
faith, and the privileges it conferred. Mahine, the king of Huahine, and 
Pomare-vahine, the heroic daughter of the king of Raiatea, with those of their 
people who had professed Christianity, arranged themselves in battle-array 
immediately behind the people of Eimeo, forming the main body of&#150; 148 
&#150; the army. Mahine on this occasion wore a curious helmet, covered on the 
outside with plates of the beautifully spotted cowrie, or tiger shell, so 
abundant in the islands; and ornamented with a plume of the tropic, or 
man-of-war bird's feathers. The queen's sister, like a daughter of Pallas, 
tall, and rather masculine in her stature and features, walked and fought by 
Mahine's side; clothed in a kind of armour, or defence, made with strongly 
twisted cords of<i>romaha</i>, or native flax, and armed with a musket and a 
spear. She was supported on one side by Farefau, her steady and courageous 
friend, who acted as her squire or champion; while Mahine was supported on the 
other by Patini, a fine, tall, manly chief, a relative of Mahine's family; and 
one who, with his wife and two children, has long enjoyed the parental and 
domestic happiness resulting from Christianity,&#151;but whose wife, prior to 
their renunciation of idolatry, had murdered twelve or fourteen children.<br>

<br> Pomare took his station in a canoe with a number of musketeers, and 
annoyed the flank of his enemy nearest the sea. A swivel mounted in the stern 
of another canoe, which was commanded by an Englishman, called Joe by the 
natives, and who came up from Raiatea, did considerable execution during the 
engagement.<br>
<br>
 Before the king's friends had properly formed themselves 
for regular defence, the idolatrous army arrived, and the battle commenced. The 
impetuous attack of the idolaters, attended with all the fury, imprecations, 
and boasting shouts practised by the savage when rushing to the onset, produced 
by its shock a temporary confusion in the advanced guard of the Christian army: 
some were slain, others wounded, and Upaparu, one of Pomare's&#150; 149 &#150; 
leading men, saved his life only by rushing into the sea, and leaving part of 
his dress in the hands of the antagonis33 with whom he had grappled. 
Notwithstanding this, the assailants met with steady and determined resistance.
</p> 
<p>Overpowered, however, by numbers, the <i>viro</i> or front ranks were 
obliged to give way. A kind of running fight commenced, and the parties 
intermingled in all the confusion of barbarous warfare.</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>&#147;Here might the hideous face of war be seen, <br>
 Stript of all pomp, 
adornment, and disguise.&#148;</p> </blockquote> 
<p>The ground on which they now fought, excepting that near the sea-beach, was 
partially covered with trees and bushes; which at times separated the 
contending parties, and intercepted their view of each other. Under these 
circumstances it was, that the Christians, when not actually engaged with their 
enemies, often kneeled down on the grass, either singly or two or three 
together, and offered up an ejaculatory prayer to God&#151;that he would cover 
their heads in the day of battle, and, if agreeable to his will, preserve them, 
but especially prepare them for the results of the day, whether victory or 
defeat, life or death.<br>
<br>
 The battle continued to rage with fierceness; 
several were killed on both sides; the idolaters still pursued their way, and 
victory seemed to attend their desolating march, until they came to the 
position occupied by Mahine, Pomare-vahine, and their companions in arms. The 
advanced ranks&#150; 150 &#150; of these united bands met, and arrested the 
progress of the hitherto victorious idolaters. One of Mahine's men, Raveae,34 
pierced the body of Upufara, the chief of Papara, and the commander-in-chief of 
the idolatrous forces. The wounded warrior fell, and shortly afterwards 
expired. As he sat gasping on the sand, his friends gathered round, and 
endeavoured to stop the bleeding of the wound, and afford every assistance his 
circumstances appeared to require. &#147;Leave me,&#148; said the dying 
warrior; &#147;mark yonder man, in front of Mahine's ranks; he inflicted this 
wound; on him revenge my death.&#148; Two or three athletic men instantly set 
off for that purpose. Raveae was retiring towards the main body of Mahine's 
men, when one of the idolaters, who had outrun his companions, sprang upon him 
before he was aware of his approach. Unable to throw him on the sand, he cast 
his arms around his neck, and en devoured to strangle, or at least to secure 
his prey, until some of his companions should arrive, and despatch him. Raveae 
was armed with a short musket, which he had reloaded since wounding the chief; 
of this, it is supposed, the man who held him was unconscious. Extending his 
arms forward, Raveae passed the muzzle of his musket under his own arm, 
suddenly turned his body on one side, and, pulling the trigger of his piece at 
the same instant, shot his antagonist through the body, who immediately lost 
hold of his prey, and fell dying to the ground.</p> 
<p>The idolatrous army continued to fight with obstinate fury, but were unable 
to advance, or make any impression on Mahine and Pomarevahine's &#150; 151 
&#150;forces. These not only maintained their ground, but forced their 
adversaries back; and the scale of victory now appeared to hang in doubtful 
suspense over the contending parties. Tino, the idolatrous priest, and his 
companions, had, in the name of Oro, promised their adherents a certain and an 
easy triumph. This inspired, them for the conflict, and made them more 
confident and obstinate in battle than they would otherwise have been; but the 
tide of conquest, which had rolled with them in the onset, and during the early 
part of the engagement, was already turned against them, and as the tidings of 
their leader's death became more extensively known, they spread a panic through 
the ranks he had commanded. The pagan army now gave way before their opponents, 
and soon fled precipitately from the field, seeking shelter in their<i>pari's
</i>, strong-holds, or hiding-places, in the mountains; leaving Pomare, Mahine, 
and the princess from Raiatea, in undisputed possession of the field.<br>
<br>
 
Flushed with success, in the moment of victory, the king's warriors were, 
according to former usage, preparing to pursue the flying enemy. Pomare 
approached, and exclaimed, Atira! It is enough! &#151;and strictly prohibited 
any of his warriors from pursuing those who had fled from the field of battle; 
forbidding them also to repair to the villages of the vanquished, to plunder 
their property, or murder their helpless wives and children.<br>
<br>
 While, 
however, the king refused to allow his men to pursue their conquered enemies, 
or to take the spoils of victory, he called a chosen band, among which was 
Farefau, who had offered up the public thanksgiving at the festival in Eimeo 
and Patini, a near relative of Mahine, who had been&#150; 152 &#150; his 
champion on that day, and sent them to Tautia, where the temple stood in which 
the great national idol, Oro, was deposited. He gave them orders to destroy the 
temple, altars, and idols with every appendage of idolatry they might find.<br>

<br> In the evening of the day, when the confusion of battle had in some degree 
subsided, Pomare and the chiefs invited the Christians to assemble, probably in 
the place in which they had been during the morning disturbed&#151;there to 
render thanks to God, for the protection he had, on that eventful day, so 
mercifully afforded. Their feelings on this occasion must have been of no 
common order. From the peaceful exercise of sacred worship, they had been that 
morning hurried into all the confusion and turmoil of murderous conflict with 
enemies, whose numbers, equipment, implacable hatred, and superstitious 
infatuation from the prediction of their prophets, had rendered them unusually 
formidable in appearance, and terrible in combat. Defeat and death had, as 
several of them have more than once declared, appeared, during several periods 
of the engagement, almost certain; and, in connexion with the anticipated 
extirpation of the Christian faith in their country, the captivity of those who 
might be allowed to live, the momentous realities of eternity, upon which, ere 
the close of the day, it appeared to themselves by no means improbable they 
would enter; had combined to produce a state of agitation, unknown in the 
ordinary course of human affairs, and seldom perhaps experienced even in the 
field of battle. They now celebrated the subversion of idolatry, under 
circumstances that, but a few hours before, had threatened their own 
extermination, with the overthrow of the religion they had espoused, and on 
&#150; 153 &#150; account of which their destruction had been sought. The Lord 
of hosts had been with them, the God of Jacob was their helper, and to him they 
rendered the glory and the praise for the protection he had bestowed, and the 
victory they had obtained. In this sacred act they were joined by numbers, who 
heretofore had worshipped only the idols of their country, but who now desired 
to acknowledge Jehovah as God alone.<br>
<br>
 The noble magnanimity of the 
king and chiefs in the hour of conquest, when under all the intoxicating 
influence of recent victory and conscious power, were no less honourable to the 
principles which they professed, and the best feelings of their hearts, than 
conducive to the cause of Christianity. This generous temper did not terminate 
with the command issued on the field of contest, but it was a prominent feature 
in all their subsequent conduct.<br>
<br>
 When the king despatched a select 
band to demolish the idol temple, he said, &#147;God not to the little island, 
where the women and children have been left for security; turn not aside to the 
villages or plantations; neither enter into the houses, nor destroy any of the 
property you may see; but go straight along the high road, through all your 
late enemy's districts.&#148; His directions were attended to; no individual 
was injured, no fence broken down, no house burned, no article of property 
taken. The bodies of the slain were not wantonly mangled, nor left exposed to 
the elements, or to be devoured by the wild dogs from the mountains, and the 
swine that formerly would have fed upon them; but were all decently buried by 
the victors, and the body of the fallen chief, Upufara, was conveyed to his own
&#150; 154 &#150;district, to be interred among the tombs of his forefathers.
<br> <br>
 Upufara, the late chief of Papara, was an intelligent and 
interesting man; his death was deeply regretted by Tati, his near relative, and 
successor in the government of the district. His mind had been for a long time 
wavering, and he was, almost to the morning of the battle, undetermined whether 
he should renounce the idols, or still continue their votary. One of his 
intimate companions informed me, that a short time before his death, he had a 
dream which somewhat alarmed him. He thought he saw an immense oven (such as 
that used in preparing<i>opio</i>) intensely heated, and in the midst of the 
fire a large fish writhing in apparent agony, unable to get out, and yet 
unconsumed, living and suffering in the midst of the fire. An impression at 
this time fixed itself on his mind, that perhaps this suffering was designed to 
shew the intensity of the torments which the wicked would endure in the place 
of punishment. He awoke in a state of great agitation of mind, with profuse 
perspiration covering his body, and was so affected, that he could not sleep 
again that night. The same individual who resided with Upufara stated also, 
that only a day or two before the battle, he said to some one, with whom he was 
conversing, &#147;Perhaps we are wrong: let us send a message to the king and 
Tati, and ask for peace; and also for books, that we may know what this new 
word, or this new religion, is.&#148; But the priests resisted his proposal, 
and assured the chiefs, that Oro would deliver the Bure Atua into their hands, 
and the<i>hau</i> and <i>mana</i>, government and power, would be with the gods 
of Tahiti. In addition to this, and any latent conviction that still might 
linger in his mind, of&#150; 155 &#150; the power of Oro, and the result of his 
anger should he draw back, he stood pledged to the cause of the gods, and 
probably might feel a degree of pride influencing his adherence to their 
interest, lest he should be charged with cowardice in wishing to avoid the war, 
on which the chiefs, who were united to suppress Christianity, had determined.
<br> <br>
 The party sent by the king to the national temple at Tautira, in 
Taiarabu, proceeded directly to their place of destination. It was apprehended 
that, notwithstanding what had befallen the adherents of idolatry in battle, 
the inhabitants of Taiarabu, who were at that time more zealous for the idols 
than those of any other part of the island, who considered it an honour to be 
entrusted with the custody of Oro, and also regarded his presence among them as 
the palladium of their safety, might, perhaps, rise en masse, to protect his 
person from insults, and his temple from spoliation. No attempt of this kind, 
however, was made. The soldiers of Pomare, soon after reaching the district, 
proceeded to the temple, acquainted the inhabitants of the place, and keepers 
of the temple, with the events of the war, and the purpose of their visit. No 
remonstrance was made, no opposition offered&#151; they entered the depository 
of Tahiti's former god; the priests and people stood round in silent 
expectation; even the soldiers paused a moment; and a scene was exhibited, 
probably strikingly analogous to that which was witnessed in the temple of 
Serapis in Alexandria, when the tutelar deity of that city was destroyed by the 
Roman soldiers. At length they brought out the idol, stripped him of his sacred 
coverings and highly-valued ornaments and threw his body contemptuously on the 
ground.</p> 
<p>&#150; 156 &#150; It was a rude, uncarved log of aito wood, <i>casuarina 
equisatifolia</i>, about six feet long. The altars were then broken down, the 
temples demolished, and the sacred houses of the gods, together with their 
covering, ornaments, and all the appendages of their worship, committed to the 
flames. The temples, altars, and idols, all round Tahiti, were shortly after 
destroyed in the same way. The log of wood, called by the natives the body of 
Oro, into which they imagined the god at times entered, and through which his 
influence was exerted, Pomare's party bore away on their shoulders, and, on 
returning to the camp, laid in triumph at their sovereign's feet. It was 
subsequently fixed up as a post in the king's kitchen, and used in a most 
contemptuous manner, by having baskets of food suspended from it; and, finally, 
it was riven up for fuel. This was the end of the principal idol of the 
Tahitians, on whom they had long been so deluded as to suppose their destinies 
depended; whose favour, kings, and chiefs, and warriors, had sought; whose 
anger all had deprecated; and who had been the occasion of more bloody and 
desolating wars, for the preceding thirty years, than all other causes 
combined. Their most zealous devotees were in general now convinced of their 
delusion, and the people united in declaring that the gods had deceived them, 
were unworthy of their confidence, and should no longer be objects of respect 
or trust.<br>
<br>
 Thus was idolatry abolished in Tahiti and Eimeo; the idols 
hurled from the thrones they had for ages occupied; and the remnant of the 
people liberated from the slavery and delusion in which, by the cunningly 
devised fables of the priests, and the &#147;doctrines of devils,&#148; they 
had been for ages<br>
&#150; 157 &#150; held as in fetters of iron. It is 
impossible to contemplate the mighty deliverance thus effected, without 
exclaiming, &#147;What hath God wrought!&#148; and desiring, with regard to 
other parts of the world, the arrival of that promised and auspicious era, when 
&#147;the gods that have not made the heavens and the earth, even they shall 
perish from the earth, and from under these heavens,&#148;35 &#147;and the 
idols he shall utterly abolish.&#148;36</p> 
<p>The total overthrow of idolatry, splendid and important as it appeared, was 
but the beginning of the amazing work that has since advanced progressively in 
those islands. It resembled the dismantling of some dark and gloomy fortress, 
or the razing to its very foundation of some horrid prison of despotism and 
cruelty, with the materials of which, when cut and polished and adorned, a fair 
and noble structure was, on its very ruins, to be erected, rising in grandeur, 
symmetry, and beauty, to the honour of its proprietor, and the admiration of 
every beholder. The work was but commenced, and the abolition of idolatry was 
but one of the great preliminaries in those designs of mercy which were daily 
unfolded, with increasing interest and importance, in their influence on the 
destiny of the people.<br>
<br>
 The conduct of the victors, on the memorable 
12th of November, had an astonishing effect on the minds of the vanquished, who 
had sought shelter in the mountains. Under cover of the darkness of night, they 
sent spies from the retreats to their habitations, and to the places of 
security in which they had left their aged and helpless relatives, their 
children, and their wives. These found all remaining as they had been left on 
the morning&#150; 158 &#150; of the battle, and were informed, by the wives and 
relatives of the defeated warriors, that Pomare and the chiefs had, without any 
exception, sent assurances of security to all who had fled. This intelligence, 
when conveyed to those who had taken refuge in the mountains, appeared to them 
incredible. After waiting, however, some days in their hiding-places, they 
ventured forth, and singly, or in small parties, returned to their dwellings; 
and when they found their plantations uninjured, their property secure, their 
wives and children safe, they were astonished. From the king they received 
assurances of pardon, and were not backward in unitedly tendering submission to 
his authority, and imploring his forgiveness for having appeared in arms 
against him.<br>
<br>
 Pomare was now, by the unanimous will of the people, 
reinstated on the throne of his father, and raised to the supreme authority in 
his dominions. His clemency in the late victory still continued to be matter of 
surprise to all the parties who had been his opponents. &#147;Where,&#148; said 
they, &#147;can the king and the Bure Atua have imbibed these new principles of 
humanity and forbearance? We have done every thing in our power, by treachery, 
stratagem, and open force, to destroy him and his adherents; and yet, when the 
power was placed in his hand, victory on his side, we at his mercy, and his 
feet upon our necks, he has not only spared our lives, and the lives of our 
families, but has respected our houses and our property!&#148; While making 
these inquiries, many of them, doubtless, recollected the conduct of his 
father, in sending one night, when the warriors of Atehuru had gone over to 
Tautira, a body of men, who at midnight fell upon their defenceless victims, 
the aged relations,&#150; 159 &#150; wives, and children of the Atehuruans, and 
in cold blood cruelly murdered upwards of one hundred helpless individuals; and 
this probably made the conduct of Pomare II. appear more remarkable. At length, 
they concluded that it must be from the new religion, as they termed 
Christianity; and hence they unanimously declared their determination to 
embrace it, and to place themselves and their families under the direction of 
its precepts.<br>
<br>
 The family and district temples and altars, as well as 
those that were national, were demolished, the idols destroyed by the very 
individuals who had but recently been so zealous for their preservation, and in 
a very short time there was not one professed idolater remaining. Messengers 
were sent by those who had hitherto been pagans, to the king and chiefs, 
requesting that some of their men might be sent to teach them to read, and to 
instruct them concerning the true God, and the order of his worship. Those who 
sent them expressed at the same time their determination to renounce every evil 
practice connected with their former idolatrous life, and their desire to 
become altogether a Christian people. Schools were built, and places for public 
worship erected; the Sabbath was observed; divine service performed; 
child-murder, and the gross abominations of idolatry, were discontinued.<br>

<br> What an astonishing and happy change must have taken place in the views, 
feelings, and pursuits of the inhabitants of Tahiti, in the course of a few 
weeks, from the battle of Narii, or Bunaau&iuml;a! A flood of light, like the 
rays of the morning, had broken in upon the intellectual and spiritual night, 
which, like a funeral pall, had long been spread &#150; 160 &#150; over the 
inhabitants of the valleys and hills of Tahiti, and had rendered their abodes, 
though naturally verdant and lovely as the bowers of Eden, yet morally 
cheerless and desolate as the region of the shadow of death!<br>
<br>
 If the 
spirits of departed prophets, from their seats of bliss, look down upon our 
globe; how must Judah's royal bard have bent with rapture, to behold the 
accomplishment of triumphs, which, while he swept the hallowed harp of 
prophecy, he had foretold&#151;the multitude of the isles made glad37 under 
Jehovah's reign, and the kings of the isles bringing presents38 to his Son!</p> 
<p>With equal transport, and with greater sympathy, those happy disembodied 
spirits of just men made perfect, who have more recently entered on their 
everlasting rest, if they have a knowledge of what passes on earth, must have 
viewed the change! And if angels, who have none of those sympathies which the 
redeemed must feel, experience an addition to their joy, in every sinner that 
by penitence returns to God, it seems an inference not unwarranted by 
revelation, that the spirits of departed believers may have a knowledge of 
events and moral changes, which transpire in our world, especially with those 
relating to the progress of the Messiah's reign among mankind. Then with what 
augmented joy must that honoured and distinguished saint,39 in strict obedience 
to whose last bequest and dying charge the South Sea Mission was attempted, 
with those holy and devoted men who first matured, and subsequently aided so 
nobly, the plan of sending the &#150; 161 &#150; gospel to Tahiti, have viewed 
the pleasing change. Those patient labourers also, who had toiled in the field, 
but had been called away before the first waive-sheaf was gathered in, must 
have felt their joy increased, as the enlarged spiritual perceptions which they 
possess enabled them to look not only on the outward change in circumstances 
and in conduct, but on that more delightful transformation of character, which 
every day unfolded some new and lovely features. And with what ecstatic songs 
of gratitude and praise, must they have welcomed, to the realms of happiness, 
the first arrivals from those clustering isles, of redeemed and purified 
spirits, who had been made partakers of the grace of life, and heirs with them 
of immortality.<br>
<br>
 The knowledge of the spiritual nature of 
Christianity, possessed by many of the new converts, was doubtless but 
imperfect, their acquaintance with the will of God but partial, and probably on 
many points of first erroneous, but still there was a warmth of feeling, and 
undisguised sincerity, and an ardour of desire, (in scripture called &#147;the 
first-love,&#148;) that has never been exceeded. Aged chiefs, and priests, and 
warriors, with their spelling-books in their hands, might be seen sitting, on 
the benches in the schools, by the side, perhaps, of some smiling little boy or 
girl, by whom they were now taught the use of letters. Others might be often 
seen employed in pulling down the houses of their idols, and erecting temples 
for the worship of the Prince of peace, working in companionship and harmony 
with those whom they had met so recently upon the field of battle.<br>
<br>
 
Their Sabbaths must have presented spectacles on which angels might look down 
with joy.</p> 
<p>&#150; 162 &#150;</p> 
<p>Crowds, who never had before attended any worship but that of their demon 
gods, might now be seen repairing to the rustic and lowly temple erected for 
Jehovah's praise; amidst their throng, mothers, wives, sisters, and daughters, 
who never were before allowed to join the other sex in any acts of worship. Few 
remained behind; all the inhabitants of the district or village, who were able, 
attended public worship. It is true, there was no Missionary to preach the 
gospel to them, or to lead their public service, yet it was performed with 
earnestness, propriety, and devotional feeling.<br>
<br>
 The more intelligent 
among the natives, who had been longest under instruction at Eimeo, usually 
presided. They sung a hymn; a portion of their scripture history, which was 
entirely composed of scripture extracts, was read; and prayer, in simplicity of 
language but sincerity of heart, was offered up to God. Those who had not 
printed books, wrote out portions of scripture for these occasions, and 
sometimes the prayers they used. these were often remarkably simple, 
expressive, and appropriate: I have one of Pomare's by me, in his own 
hand-writing, furnished by Mr. Nott. There is no date affixed to it, but from 
the evident frequency with which it has been used, and the portion of scripture 
written on the preceding pages of the same sheet of paper, I am inclined to 
think it was written about this period. The prayer is excellent, and the 
translation, which I also received from Mr. Nott, will require from the 
Christian reader no apology for its insertion, as a specimen of the style and 
sentiments employed by the natives of Tahiti in their devotional services. It 
is as follows:&#151;</p> 
<p>&#150; 163 &#150;</p> 
<p>&#147;Jehovah, thou God of our salvation, hear our prayers, pardon thou our 
sins, and save our souls. Our sins are great, and more in number than the fishes
40 in the sea, and our obstinacy has been very great, and without parallel. 
Turn thou us to thyself, and enable us to cast off every evil way. Lead us to 
Jesus Christ, and let our sins be cleansed in his blood. Grant us thy good 
Spirit to be our sanctifier. Save us from hypocrisy. Suffer us not to come to 
thine house with carelessness, and return to our own houses and commit sin. 
Unless thou have mercy upon us, we perish. Unless thou save us, unless we are 
prepared and made meet for thy habitation in heaven, we are banished to the 
fire, we die; but let us not be banished to that unknown world of fire. Save 
thou us through Jesus Christ, thy Son, the prince of life; yea, let us obtain 
salvation through him. Bless all the inhabitants of these islands, all the 
families thereof; let every one stretch out his hands unto God, and say, Lord, 
save me, Lord, save me. Let all these islands, Tahiti with all the people of 
Moorea, and of Huahine, and of Raiatea, and of the little islands around, 
partake of thy salvation. Blees Britain, and every country in the world. Let 
thy word grow with speed in the world, so as to exceed the progress of evil. Be 
merciful to us and bless us, for Jesus Christ's sake. Amen.</p> 
<p>While these delightful changes were advancing in Tahiti, the king and his 
friends were not unmindful&#150; 164 &#150; of those who had been left behind 
in a state of painful uncertainty at Eimeo. As soon as possible after the 
battle, a canoe was despatched by Mahine, king of Eimeo and Huahine, with the 
tidings of its result. Matapuupuu, or, as he is now called, Taua, was the 
bearer of the gladdening intelligence, and was a very suitable person to be 
sent on such an errand. He was a native of Huahine, where he had been chief 
priest since the death of his elder brother, who had sustained that office 
before him. He came up from Huahine to Pomare's assistance in 1811; early in 
the year 1813, he had made a profession of Christianity, and was among the 
first whose names were written down at Eimeo. He was not only a priest, but an 
Areoi, and a warrior of no ordinary prowess. When his canoe approached the 
shore of Eimeo, the teachers and their pupils hastened to the beach, under the 
conflicting emotions of hope and fear. The warrior was seen standing on the 
prow of his light skiff, that seemed impatiently dashing through the spray, and 
rushing along the tops of the waves towards the shore, which its keel scarcely 
touched, when, with his light mat around his loins, his scarf hanging loosely 
over his shoulder, and his spear in his hand, he leaped upon the sandy beach. 
Before they had time to ask a single question, he exclaimed, &#147;Ua pau! Ua 
pau! i te bure anae;&#148; Vanquished ! vanquished ! by prayer alone ! His 
words at first seemed but as words of irony or jest; but the earnestness of his 
manner, the details he gave, and the intelligence he brought from the king and 
some of the chiefs, confirmed the declaration.<br>
<br>
 The Missionaries were 
almost overcome with surprise, and hastened to render their acknowledgment
&#150; 165 &#150; of grateful praise to the Most High, under feelings that it 
would be impossible to describe. It was, indeed, a joy unspeakable, the joy of 
harvest. In that one year they reaped the harvest of sixteen laborious 
seed-times, sixteen dreary and anxious winters, and sixteen unproductive 
summers. They now enjoyed the unexpected but exhilarating satisfaction 
resulting from the pleasure of the Lord prospering in their hands, in a degree 
and under circumstances that few are privileged to experience.<br>
<br>
 As 
soon as possible, Mr. Nott was despatched by his companions to Tahiti. On 
reaching the shores of this island, from which five years before he had been 
obliged to flee for his life, he found it was all true that had been told them, 
that the people were in that interesting state described by the prophet, when, 
enraptured by the visions of Messiah's future glories, he exclaimed, &#147;The 
isles shall wait for his law.&#148; In this delightful situation, as he 
travelled round the islands, he literally found them not merely willing to be 
instructed, but anxious to hear; meeting together of their own accord, and 
often spending the hours of night in conversation and inquiry on the important 
matters connected with the religion of Jesus Christ. When he returned, Mr. 
Bicknell went over on the same errand; and observed every where the most 
encouraging attention, on the part of the people, to the instructions he 
communicated. The school at Papetoai was greatly increased; and hundreds, who 
had been early scholars there, were now stationed as teachers among the 
adjacent islands, imparting to others the knowledge they had received.<br>
<br>

 Not fewer than three thousand persons at this&#150; 166 &#150; time possessed 
a knowledge of the books in their native language, which were in daily use. 
Besides eight hundred copies of the Abridgment of Scripture, and many copies of 
part of the Gospel of St. Luke in manuscript, about two thousand seven hundred 
spelling-books had already been distributed among the pupils at Eimeo, or sent 
over to Tahiti; still they were unable to meet the daily increasing demands of 
the people.</p>

<br>
 The mighty 
workings of the Spirit of God, in producing this remarkable change, were not 
confined to Tahiti, Eimeo, and the adjacent islands, forming the Georgian 
group, it extended also to the Leeward or Society Islands. A simultaneous 
movement appears to have taken place among the rulers of the people, to throw 
off the yoke of pagan priestcraft, to rend asunder their fetters, and remove 
from the eyes of the nation, in its remote extremities, the veil of delusion by 
which they had so long been blinded. Tamatoa, the king of Raiatea, shortly 
after his return from Tahiti, publicly renounced idol-worship, and declared 
himself a believer in Jehovah and Jesus Christ. Many of the chiefs, and a 
number of the people, followed his example.<br>
<br>
 The prince of darkness, 
the author of paganism, whose sway had been unrivalled, and whose seat&#150; 
168 &#150;and stronghold had long been here, as well as in the other islands, 
did not tamely surrender his dominions. The idolatrous chiefs and inhabitants 
took up arms, to defend the cause of the gods, and revenge the insult offered 
by the king Their efforts, however, were but as the ragings of an expiring 
monster, whose fangs were broken, and whose heart had been pierced. The 
idolaters were defeated, and afterwards treated with the same clemency and 
Jenient conduct which the Christian conquerors in Tahiti had manifested, and 
Christianity was firmly established. The vanquished, however, though spared and 
liberated by the generosity of Tamatoa, shewed themselves unworthy of the 
kindness with which they had been treated, by still talking of war on behalf of 
the idols. But as their numbers were few, their influence small, and as the 
great body of the people were doubtless favourable to the new order of things, 
hopes of success were comparatively faint, and no further attempt was made.<br>

<br> The chiefs and greater part of the population of Tahaa, an island included 
in the same reef with Raiatea, imitated the example of Tamatoa and the Raiatean 
Christians, and destroyed their idols.<br>
<br>
 The intelligent and 
enterprising chiefs of Borabora, Mai, and Tefaaora, were remarkably active in 
weakening the influence of the gods on the minds of the people under their 
government, undermining and subverting every species of idol-worship that 
prevailed in the islands. They succeeded, at length, in inducing the 
inhabitants, by their example and persuasion, to seek an acquaintance with that 
more excellent way revealed in the word of God, for whose worship they erected 
a convenient and respectable building.</p> 
<p>&#150; 169 &#150;</p> 
<p>Mahine sent a special message to Huahine, and the same change took place in 
that island; which was perhaps, for its size and population, more attached to 
its idols than any other. Idol-worship, with all its attendant cruelty and 
moral degradation, was discontinued. The temples were demolished, and the gods 
committed to the flames. Thus, in one year, the system of false worship, which 
had, from the earliest antiquity of its population, prevailed in these islands, 
was happily abolished&#151;it is hoped, to be revived no more.<br>
<br>
 In the 
course of the following year, the loss sustained by the death of Mr. Scott was 
repaired by the arrival of Mr. Crook from New South Wales; he reached the 
islands in the month of May, and rendered important service in the prosecution 
of the common enterprise.<br>
<br>
 During the same year, the profession of 
Christianity became general throughout the whole of the Society Islands. By 
universal consent the infamous Areoi society was destroyed at the same time. 
Its own members appear to have made no efforts to preserve, and no class of the 
community even solicited, its continuance. The entire dissolution of this 
association, and the abolition of its cruel and abominable practices, on the 
introduction of Christianity, is one of the most powerful demonstrations God 
has given to his church and to the world, of the irresistible operation of 
those means which he has appointed for the complete demolition of the very 
strong holds of paganism, and the universal extension of virtue and of 
happiness among the most profligate and debased of mankind. It is a matter of 
devout acknowledgment to the Almighty, by whose power alone the means employed 
have been rendered efficacious in its&#150; 170 &#150; annihilation, and 
furnishes a cause of hallowed triumph to the friends of moral order, humanity, 
and religion.<br>
<br>
 No sooner did these deluded, polluted, and cruel 
people, receive the gospel of Christ, the elevated sentiments, sacred purity, 
and humane tendency of which, convinced them that it must have originated in a 
source as opposite to that whence idolatry had sprung, as light is to darkness, 
than the spell in which they had been for ages bound was dissolved, and the 
chains of their captivity were burst asunder. They were astonished at 
themselves, and were a wonder to all who beheld them. The fabled legends by 
which, as by enchantment, they had been deceived, were banished from their 
recollections; the abominations and the bloodshed to which they had been 
addicted, ceased; and they became moral, virtuous, affectionate, devout, and 
upright members of a Christian community. There is reason to believe that many, 
even of the Areois, have been purified from their moral defilement, in that 
blood which cleanseth from all sin, and that the language addressed by the 
apostle to the Corinthians41 may with propriety be applied to them.<br>
<br>
 
The astonishing and gratifying change which has taken place among them, nothing 
but Christian principles could have effected. Numbers of the Areois early 
embraced Christianity, and some from the highest orders were among the first 
converts. With few exceptions, they have been distinguished by ardour of zeal, 
and steady adherence to the religion of the Bible. Many of them have been its 
most regular and laborious teachers in our schools, and the most efficient and 
successful&#150; 171 &#150; native Missionaries. Among this class, also, as 
might naturally be expected, have been experienced the most distressing 
apprehensions of the consequences of sin, and the greatest compunction of mind 
on account of it. Many of them immediately changed their names, and others 
would be happy to obliterate every mark of that fraternity, the badges of which 
they once considered an honourable distinction. I have heard several wish they 
could remove from their bodies the marks tataued upon them, but these figures 
remain too deeply fixed to be obliterated, and perpetually remind them of what 
they once were. It is satisfactory to know, that not a few have enjoyed a sense 
of the pardoning mercy of God, and though some have been distressed in the 
prospect of death, others have been happy in the cheering hope, not of a pagan 
elysium, or a sensual sort of Turkish paradise, but of a holy and peaceful rest 
in the regions of blessedness.<br>
<br>
 One of these, whose name was Manu, 
bird, resided at Bunaau&iuml;a, in the district of Atehuru. His age and bodily 
infirmities were such as to prevent his learning to read, yet he constantly 
attended the school, and, from listening to others, was able to repeat with 
correctness large portions of the scriptures, which were regularly read by the 
pupils. From meditation on these, he derived the highest consolation and 
support. He was an early convert to Christianity; his deportment was uniformly 
upright; his character respected by all who knew him; and for several years 
before his death, he was a member of the Christian church at Burder's Point. 
The recollection of the abominations and iniquity of which he had been guilty 
while a member of the Areoi institution, though not greater&#150; 172 &#150; 
than those of his companions in crime, often filled his mind with horror and 
dismay. Whenever he alluded to that society, or to the crimes committed by its 
members, it was always with evident feelings of the deepest distress. From 
these it was his mercy to find relief, through faith in the atonement of 
Christ. This was his only ground of hope for pardon from the Most High; and 
when, by thus looking to the great means of purity and peace, he was enabled to 
rest in hope, and his mind became calm and peaceful, tears of contrition were 
often seen, while he gratefully remembered the amazing love of God. Towards the 
latter part of his life, his pastor had the pleasure of observing the greatest 
circumspection and moral purity in his whole conduct, with a high and 
increasing degree of spirituality of mind and tranquil joy. How striking the 
contrast which the evening of his days must have presented, to the early part 
of his life, spent among the impure, degraded, and wretched members of that 
infamous association to which he belonged! It is not surprising that his own 
mind should have been so deeply affected; but from all the moral pollution and 
guilt then contracted, he was washed and renewed, and prepared for the society 
of the blessed in the abode of purity and happiness. He died suddenly on the 
5th of March, 1823; and, to use the language of the Missionary who watched his 
progress and his end with the deepest interest, we doubt not that he is gone to 
be with that Saviour, &#147;whom he loved with all his heart.&#148;<br>
<br>
 
Soon after the abolition of idolatry by the inhabitants of Huahine, Raiatea, 
and the adjacent islands, several of the chiefs and the people of Borabora and 
Raiatea visited Maurua, the most westerly of&#150; 173 &#150; the Leeward 
Islands, and succeeded in persuading the chiefs and people to demolish their 
temples and idols, and receive Christian instruction. The most pleasing results 
continued also to attend the efforts of the new converts in Tahiti.<br>
<br>
 
In the beginning of 1816, Pomare sent most of his own family idols to the 
Missionaries, that, as he observed in a letter accompanying them, dated 
February 19th, &#147;they might either commit them to the flames, or send them 
to England.&#148; These idols I saw at Port Jackson; they are now deposited in 
the Missionary Museum, Austin Friars. It is impossible to behold them without 
sympathizing in the feelings of Pomare, when he calls them &#147;Tahiti's 
foolish gods.&#148; The following is a translation of the letter which he sent 
with them. Its interesting contents will justify its insertion.</p> 
<p>Friends,</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>May you be saved by Jehovah, and Jesus Christ our Saviour. This is my 
speech to you, my friends. I wish you to send those idols to Britane for the 
Missionary Society, that they may know the likeness of the gods that Tahiti 
worshipped. Those were my own idols, belonging to our family from the time of 
Taaroamanahune even to Vairaatoa: and when he died he left them with me. And 
now, having been made acquainted with the true God, with Jehovah, He is my God, 
and when this body of mine shall be dissolved in death, may the Three-One save 
me! And this is my shelter, my close hiding-place, even from the anger of 
Jehovah. When he looks upon me, I will hide me at the feet of Jesus Christ the 
Saviour, that I may escape. I feel pleasure and satisfaction in my mind; I 
rejoice, I praise Jehovah, that he hath made known his word unto me. I should 
have gone to destruction if Jehovah had not interposed. Many have died, and are 
gone to destruction, kings and common people; they died without knowing any 
thing of the true God; and now, when it came to the small remainder of the 
people, Jehovah hath been pleased to make known his word, and we are made&#150; 
174 &#150; acquainted with his good word, made acquainted with the deception of 
the false gods, with all that is evil and false. The true God Jehovah, it was 
he that made us acquainted with these things. It was you that taught us; but 
the words, the knowledge, was from Jehovah. It is because of this that I 
rejoice, and I pray to Jehovah, that he may increase my abhorrence of every 
evil way. The Three-One, He it is that can make the love of sin to cease; we 
cannot effect it; it is the work of God to cause evil things to be cast off, 
and the love of them to cease.<br>
 I am going a journey around Tahiti, to 
acquaint the Raatiras with the word of God, and to cause them to be vigilant 
about good things. The word of God does grow in Tahiti, and the Raatiras are 
diligent about setting up houses for worship, they are also diligent in seeking 
instruction, and now it is well with Tahiti.<br>
 That principal idol, that has 
the red fathers of the Otuu, is Temeharo, that is his name, look you; you may 
know it by the red feathers; that was Vairaatoa's own god, and those feathers 
were from the ship of Lieutenant Watts;42 it was Vairaatoa that set them 
himself about the idol. If you think proper, you may burn them all in the fire; 
or, if you like, send them to your country, for the inspection of the people of 
Europe, that they may satisfy their curiosity, and know Tahiti's foolish gods!
<br> This also in one thing that I want to inquire of you: when I go round 
Tahiti: it may be that the Raatiras and others will ask me to put down their 
names; what shall I do then? Will it be proper to write down their names? It is 
with you&#151;you are our teachers, and you are to direct us. We have had our 
prayer-meeting the beginning of this month, February; it was at Homai-au-Vahi; 
the Raatiras, and all the people of the district assembled, leaving their 
houses without people. They said to me, &#145;Write down our names.&#146; I 
answered, &#145;It is agreed.&#146; Those names are in the enclosed paper, 
which I have sent for your inspection. Have I done wrong in this? Perhaps I 
have: let me, my friends, know the whole of your mind in respect of this matter.
<br> May my friends be saved by Jehovah the true God! I have written to Mahine 
for a house for the use of the Missionaries, when they arrive; you will let 
Mahine know where the house is to be, and he will get the people to remove it 
there. Let it be at Uaeva, near you.</p> </blockquote> 
<p>&#150; 175 &#150;</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>It is reported here, that there is a ship at Morea, and I was thinking it 
might be the ship with the Missionaries; but it may be that it is only an idle 
report. However, should the Missionaries arrive at Morea, write to me quickly, 
that I may know. Let me know also, what news there may be from Europe and from 
Port Jackson. Perhaps King George may be dead, let me know. I shall not go 
around Tahiti before the month of March.<br>
 May you be saved, my friends, by 
Jehovah, and Jesus Christ, the only Saviour by whom we sinners can be saved.</p>
<p>Pomare, King of Tahiti, &amp;c. &amp;c. Tahiti Motu Ta, Feb. 19, 1816.</p> 
</blockquote> 
<p>It was shortly after these events had transpired, that we reached the 
islands. Previous to our embarkation from England, we had heard that a 
favourable change, in regard to Christianity, had taken place in the minds of 
the king of Tahiti, and a few of the people. On our arrival in Port Jackson, 
this intelligence was confirmed, and we were also encouraged by the accounts we 
received of the abolition of idolatry by the whole of the inhabitants of the 
Georgian or Windward Islands.<br>
<br>
 When we arrived, we found, not only 
that the reports we had heard were correct, but that the change had 
progressively advanced, becoming daily more extensive in its influence and 
decisive in its character, and that the whole of the inhabitants were no longer 
idolaters, but either professors of Christianity, or desirous to receive 
religious instruction.<br>
<br>
 It was naturally a matter of the deepest 
interest to a Missionary, important in all its bearings on the object nearest 
to his heart, and first in the aims and the purposes of his life.<br>
<br>
 The 
accounts given by the Missionaries, on my first arrival, and the many 
interesting facts which subsequently came to my knowledge, when I had&#150; 176 
&#150; acquired such an acquaintance with the language of the people, as to be 
able to pursue my inquiries among them, have made an impression on my own mind 
that will never be effaced, and not only excited the highest delight, but 
convinced me, that, in the circumstances under which the change occurred, the 
agency by which it was accomplished, and the continuance of its effects, it is 
altogether one of the most remarkable displays of Divine power that has 
occurred in the history of mankind, and is, perhaps, unparalleled since the 
days of the apostles. Detached notices of this event have been transmitted to 
England in the letters of the Missionaries, and in the different publications 
of the Missionary Society. No connected and regular account has, however, yet 
been furnished; but in reviewing all that has been recorded, it may be 
confidently affirmed, in the language of the deputation sent by the Society to 
the South Seas, that &#147;God has indeed done great things here.&#148;<br>
<br>
 It is much to be regretted, that the Missionaries on the spot&#151;who were 
intimately acquainted with every indication of the moral and spiritual process 
that was going on, even in its incipient stages, and every event which marked 
its gradual development, until, in the language of the natives on another but 
similar occasion, it burst upon them like the light of the morning&#151;did 
not, at the time, prepare a full and particular account of the work which, 
under God, they had been instrumental in effecting: but their motto always was, 
to &#147;say too little rather than too much,&#148; to persevere in labour, 
rather than employ their time in detailing their engagements; and to exercise 
the greatest caution and brevity in speaking of any thing connected&#150; 177 
&#150;with themselves, or the people around them, lest subsequent events should 
disappoint the anticipations which existing favourable appearances might 
originate. This prudential reserve, on some accounts, cannot be too highly 
commended; yet, it is possible to carry it too far; and, in the present 
instance, however honourable to the individuals who maintained it, it cannot be 
doubted that the world has been thereby deprived of a full record of events, 
intimately connected with the destinies of the of the people among whom they 
transpired, and with the propagation of the gospel in the most distant parts of 
the world, during every future age of the Christian church.<br>
<br>
 I have 
endeavoured to present an outline of this great change. I would, however, only 
offer it as a substitute for the more explicit statement which my predecessors 
in the islands might render; and if, by attracting their attention to the 
subject, I should induce them to furnish such a desideratum, my attempts will 
not have been altogether in vain. Should this be elicited, they will confer no 
ordinary benefit on the cause of Missions, and afford great satisfaction to the 
Christian world.<br>
<br>
 A number of interesting and important inquiries is 
naturally suggested by this amazing change; and we are anxious to be made 
acquainted with every fact, in the application of those means which induced its 
commencement, and sustained its progress. In all its departments, and under 
every circumstance, it bears the impress, and exhibits, in the clearest manner, 
the sovereignty and the power, of the Almighty, in regard alike to the time of 
its commencement, the circumstances of its progress, and the means of its 
accomplishment.<br>
<br>
 In regard to the time of its occurrence. During 
&#150; 178 &#150; no period in the history of the Mission, could &#147;the time 
to favour&#148; the nation have appeared more unlikely than the present. The 
king's mind appears to have been first seriously exercised in reference to the 
declaration which he subsequently made, after the dispersion of the 
Missionaries, and their departure from the islands, when only one (viz. Mr. 
Nott) remained with him; and when, in consequence of the state of perpetual 
alarm and agitation in which the people were kept by the war, none could be 
induced to attend preaching or instruction. It is probable that at that period 
public ordinances were altogether discontinued. The first public or open 
indications of the change, were given at a time which, according to human 
probabilities, was but little favourable to such events. The Missionaries had 
but recently returned from their banishment, and the work of instruction had 
scarcely been resumed; it was the beginning, and but the beginning, of a second 
attempt to plant the gospel in those islands. The Missionaries, considering the 
whole of the twelve years spent in Tahiti as so much time lost, were commencing 
afresh their endeavours on another island, and could hardly expect that at this 
time, after such a protracted delay, God would at once prosper their enterprise.
<br> <br>
 The circumstances of the nation, and of the Mission, were by no 
means favourable to such a change. It was not a time of peace and leisure, but 
of protracted, obstinate, and barbarous war&#151;the king and his adherents 
were in exile, alternately agitated by the entreaties of their auxiliaries to 
attempt to retrieve their affairs by a descent upon Tahiti, or expecting their 
retreat to be invaded by their audacious and rebellious&#150; 179 &#150; 
conquerors. It was a period of humiliation, darkness, and distress; while the 
population of Tahiti itself was torn by factions, and desolated by wars, that 
threatened its extinction. Their teachers were not much more favourably 
circumstanced. Few in number, compared with what they had been when they 
maintained their former station in Matavai, and suffering under the heaviest 
domestic bereavements; prevented by personal indisposition, and other 
circumstances, from engaging, either very frequently or extensively, in the 
main work of instructing the people; their exertions, greatly to their own 
regret, were exceedingly circumscribed. In addition to these discouragements, 
the prejudices of many of the king's most warm and valuable friends were 
unusually strong, as they considered the continuance of his misfortunes to 
result, in part, from the countenance he gave, and the inclination he 
manifested towards, the religion of the foreigners.<br>
<br>
 In the means 
employed there was nothing extraordinary. It is recorded, in the history of the 
Greenland Missions, that the Moravian brethren, for five or seven years, 
laboured patiently and diligently in teaching their hearers what are termed the 
first principles of religion&#151;inculcating the doctrines of the being and 
attributes of God, and the requirements of his law&#151;without making the 
least favourable impression upon them, or being, in many instances, able to 
secure the attention of the people to their instructions. The first instance of 
decisive and salutary effect from their teaching, was, we are informed, what 
would, in general, be termed accidental, and occasioned by their reading to 
some native visitors an account of the sufferings and death of the Saviour, 
which they&#150; 180 &#150; were translating into the vernacular tongue. The 
attention of one of the party was arrested, his heart deeply affected, and 
ultimately his character entirely changed. This circumstance led to a complete 
alteration in the instructions they gave. The incarnation, the life, especially 
the sufferings and death, of the Lord Jesus Christ, were, from this time, the 
principal subjects brought before the minds of their hearers; and the results 
were such as to shew the propriety of the alteration. Where they had before 
been unable to make the least impression, they now beheld numbers deeply 
affected, on whom these truths appeared to produce an entire change of 
character and deportment. I do not, however, suppose we are to infer from the 
account that is given of this amazing work in Greenland, that, during the first 
five or seven years of their labours there, the being and character of God, 
&amp;c. were inculcated, to the exclusion or neglect of the way of salvation 
through Jesus Christ. Their teaching would, in that case, have been more 
defective than I am willing to suppose it was. Nor do I think we are to 
conclude, that, after the change in their instruction, the doctrine of the 
Saviour's advent, sufferings, and death, were insisted on, to the exclusion of 
the former; this mode of exhibiting scripture truth would have been almost as 
defective as the other: but I suppose that, during the earliest years of their 
labours, the first principles of religion were more frequent and prominent in 
their instructions, than the doctrines peculiar to the gospel, and that, 
subsequently, these points received that more frequent attention, which the 
character, being, and law of God, had formerly obtained. No alteration, even of 
this kind, however,&#150; 181 &#150; appears to have taken place in the kind of 
doctrines inculcated by the Missionaries among the Tahitians. From the time of 
my arrival in the islands, I had always a great desire to know whether any 
change had been made by the early preachers in their discourses, and other 
means employed at this period: but I have not been able to learn that there was 
any thing extraordinary; they do not appear in any respect to have varied the 
manner, or the matter, of their instructions. I have often asked Mr. Nott, and 
others who were on the spot, if there was any alteration in the mode of 
instruction, or the nature of their addresses, as to the prominency of any of 
the doctrines of the gospel, which had not been so fully exhibited before; but 
I have invariably learned, that they were not aware of the least difference in 
the kind of instruction, or the manner of representing the truths taught at 
this period, and those inculcated during their former residence in Tahiti.<br>

<br> Their aim had always been to exhibit fully, and with the greatest possible 
simplicity, the grand doctrines and precepts taught in the Bible, giving each 
that share of attention which it appeared to have obtained in the volume of 
revelation. God, they had always endeavoured to represent as a powerful, 
benevolent, and holy Being, justly requiring the grateful homage, and willing 
obedience, of his creatures. Man, they had represented as the Scripture 
described him, and their own observation represented him to be, a sinner 
against his Maker, and exposed to the consequences of his guilt;&#151;the love 
of God, in the gift of his only begotten Son, as a propitiation for sin, and 
the only medium and ground of reconciliation with God,&#150; 182 &#150; 
restoration to the enjoyment of his favour, and the blessing of immortality. 
The death of Christ in the place of the sinner, and faith in this atonement, as 
the sinner's justification before God, were truths most frequently exhibited. 
The doctrine of Divine benevolence, thus displayed, was altogether new to the 
Tahitians; nothing analogous to it had ever entered into any part of their 
mythology. Its impression on their minds was at this time proportionate. The 
necessity also of Divine influences, to make the declaration of these truths 
effectual to conversion, and to meeten those who believed, for the heavenly 
state, had ever been inculcated in the catechetical and other exercises of the 
school, in the meetings for reading the Scriptures and conversation, and in the 
discourses delivered in their assemblies for public worship.43</p> 
<p>It is not, however, my object now to remark on the toasts, nor even the 
speech of Dr. Carpenter, excepting so far as the speech regards the 
instructions given to the Tahitians. It is not necessary that I should offer 
any vindication of what Mr. Ward and his companions taught the Hindoos. His 
sermon on the love of Christ, besides other public records which he has left, 
prevent its being questionable whether he taught Unitarianism or not. And I 
cannot but regret, that by Dr. Carpenter, towards whom I entertain no other 
feelings than those of respect, and desire to use no other language than that 
which courtesy would dictate, any statement in these volumes should have been 
so misunderstood as to have occasioned the declaration to which I have felt it 
needful to refer. It is somewhat singular, that my companions and myself, 
though in each instance we have inculcated the same sentiments, should have 
been represented by one class of readers as, &#147;by my own account,&#148; 
usually choosing, for subjects of address, &#147;the immaculate conception, the 
Trinity, and the Holy Ghost, and other mysterious doctrinal points;&#148; and 
by another class, as teaching &#147;the simple principles of Unitarianism.&#148;
<br> <br>
 It is difficult to suppose that, when this latter assertion was 
made, it simply meant, that, in connexion with other great doctrines of 
revelation, the Missionaries taught that, in opposition to the &#147;lords 
many, and the gods many,&#148; the gods of wood, and stone, and feathers, the 
works of their own hands which the heathen worshipped, there was One living and 
true God. By &#147;other great doctrines of revelation,&#148; I refer, in 
addition to the existence, perfections, and character of the true God, to the 
doctrine of the fall of man from his original state of rectitude and happiness; 
and, in consequence of this, to an inherent disposition to prefer and practise 
evil, and an exposedness to its penalty; to the Messiah, the divinely appointed 
and only means of deliverance; to the divinity of Christ; to the atonement by 
his death; to faith in him as the sinner's justification before God; and to the 
divinity of the Holy Spirit, and the necessity of his influence to render the 
declaration of the gospel effectual to those to whom it was proclaimed.<br>
<br>
 If Dr. Carpenter meant that, with these doctrines as parts of a revelation, to 
the completeness of which they were essential, and in the full declaration of 
which their own fidelity was to be proved, the Missionaries inculcated a belief 
in one God; he must have known, that the term Unitarianism, when used as 
descriptive of such teaching, was inapplicable to the sentiments of those who 
have designated themselves Unitarians. But if, when Dr. Carpenter stated that 
in the South Sea Islands &#147;the simple principles of Unitarianism are 
essentially taught,&#148; he meant that the Missionaries instructed the natives 
in the belief of one God, to the exclusion or neglect of the other great 
doctrines of revelation above stated, viz. that they taught what those whom he 
addressed considered as the essential principles of Unitarianism&#151;then the 
assertion appears entirely gratuitous.<br>
<br>
 There is not, and there has 
not been, a single Missionary there, since their first establishment, now 
four-and-thirty years ago, who, had he inculcated what Unitarians themselves 
call Unitarianism, would not have been regarded, by his companions, as having 
renounced his faith, and forsaken his Lord. The command of Christ to teach all 
nations, in obedience to which the Missionary had devoted his life to the 
labour of preaching the gospel, directed him to baptize every proselyte in the 
name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, and thus explicitly 
enjoined the exhibition of the doctrine of the Trinity, which every Unitarian 
professes to deny: and, so far as Polynesian Researches is concerned, the 
affirmation appears without the least foundation.<br>
<br>
 In confirmation of 
this, it is unnecessary to do more than refer to the work itself. The passage, 
in connexion with which these remarks are introduced, together with every 
other, in which the sentiments held or taught by the Missionaries are stated, 
are sufficient to shew that they have not promulgated a mutilated 
gospel&#151;the vast accession of enjoyment to all classes, shews that is not a 
melancholy system&#151;while the opinions expressed by the converts themselves, 
shew that their faith is not what is usually denominated Unitarian. This is 
abundantly proved by the statements made in seasons when men are most likely to 
be sincere&#151;the near approach to the unseen world, and the direct appeal to 
the Most High in prayer. Illustration of this remark may be found in Pomare's 
prayer, recorded in page 163; his letter, page 173; the experience of the dying 
Areoi, page 172; the conduct of the astonished native, on hearing the 3d 
Chapter of St. John's Gospel, as given in page 187 of the present volume; and 
other places, which it is needless to enumerate. On the tenets of Unitarians, 
their adaptation to the circumstances of ignorance, depravity, guilt, and 
wretchedness, inseparable from paganism, even in its most favourable 
circumstances, I make no remarks.<br>
<br>
 The foregoing statement of the 
teaching of the Missionaries in the South Sea Islands, I have deemed not less 
just to them than due to my readers.</p> 
<p>&#150; 183 &#150;</p> 
<p>The wonderful change that now seemed to be wrought in the minds and hearts 
of many, did not appear to be more the immediate result of instructions given 
at the time, than the remote but certain effect of truth imparted, and precious 
seed, which, having been scattered years before, was now revived with a power, 
that the individuals themselves could not comprehend, nor on ordinary 
principles explain. This circumstance should never be lost sight of; it is a 
wonderful manifestation of the faithfulness of God, who has declared&#150; 184 
&#150; that his word shall not return unto him void, but shall be found even 
after many days; and it is remarkably adapted to cheer the hearts of all who 
are called to labour and wait patiently, sowing season after season in hope, 
without reaping the wished-for harvest.<br>
<br>
 The universal, and in many 
instances decisive moral and religious change, that has been effected in the 
South Sea Islands, (of the commencement, and more important parts of which, a 
regular, though necessarily brief account, has now been&#150; 185 &#150; 
given,) appears, in whatever view we can possibly contemplate either its nature 
or its results, nothing less than a moral miracle. A change so important in its 
character, so rapid in its progress, so decisive in its influence, sublime 
almost in proportion to the feebleness of the agency by which it was, under 
God, accomplished, although effected on but a small tribe or people, is perhaps 
not exceeded in the history of nations, or the revolutions of empires, that 
have so often altered the moral and<br>
&#150; 186 &#150; civil aspect of our 
world. This great and important event, confirmed in its results, and 
strengthened in its character, by the extension of its influence, and the 
increasing power of the principles it implanted, during the last fourteen 
years, already occupies no inferior place among the modern evidences of 
Christianity, and the demonstrations of its legitimate tendency to ameliorate 
the condition, and elevate the moral and intellectual character, of the most 
wretched and depraved among mankind.</p> 
<p>&#150; 187 &#150;</p> 
<p>Emotions of astonishment, admiration, and gratitude, involuntarily arise in 
every mind in the least degree susceptible of humanity or religion; while 
increasing convictions of the divine origin of revelation must fasten on the 
understanding, and additional encouragement strengthen the hopes, of every 
individual who, according to the promise of God, is anticipating the arrival of 
a period, when a transformation, equally decisive and lovely, shall change the 
moral deserts of the earth into regions of order and beauty, and the wilderness 
shall become as the garden of the Lord.<br>
<br>
 In order more fully to 
illustrate the kind of scripture truth that appears, in connexion with others, 
to have affected deeply the minds of the people, one single instance, among 
many that might be adduced, will shew, that in the mild and verdant islands of 
the south, as well as the frozen and barren regions of the north, in Tahiti as 
well as in Greenland, the attractions of the Cross move and melt the human 
heart. It was the custom of the Missionaries, not only to instruct the natives 
in the school, preach to them in the chapel, and itinerate through the 
villages, but to assemble them for the purpose of reading, from manuscript, 
such portions of the scripture as were deemed suitable to their circumstances. 
On one of these occasions, Mr. Nott was reading the first portions of the 
Gospel of St. John to a number of the natives. When he had finished the 
sixteenth verse of the third chapter, a native, who had listened with avidity 
and joy to the words, interrupted him; and said, &#147;What words were those 
you read? what sounds were those I heard? let me hear those words again.&#148; 
Mr. Nott read again the verse, &#147;God so loved,&#148; &amp;c. when the 
native rose from his seat,&nbsp;&#150; 188 &#150; and said, Is that true? can 
that be true? God love the world, when the world not love him! God so loved the 
world as to give his Son to die, that man might not die! Can that be true? Mr. 
Nott again read the verse, &#147;God so loved the world,&#148; &amp;c. told him 
it was true, and that it was the message God had sent to them, and that 
whosoever believed in him, would not perish, but be happy after death. The 
overwhelming feelings of the wondering native were too powerful for expression 
or restraint. He burst into tears, and as these chased each other down his 
countenance, he retired to meditate in private on the amazing love of God, 
which had that day reached his soul; and there is every reason to believe he 
was afterwards raised to share the peace and happiness resulting from the love 
of God shed abroad in his heart.<br>
<br>
 Connected with the means employed in 
the accomplishment of this important work, a few remarks on the agents who, 
under God, were instrumental in effecting it, may not be inappropriate. In 
common with the Missionaries in other parts of the world, they have been 
described, by the enemies of religion, as ignorant and dogmatical fanatics; 
more intent on the inculcation of the peculiarities of their sect or party, 
than promoting the wellbeing of the people; holding out no inducement, by 
precept or example, to industrious habits, &amp;c. The present state of the 
islands in which they have spent so many years, compared with what it was at 
the time of their arrival, and during several subsequent years, is a sufficient 
refutation to every charge of this kind.<br>
<br>
 But there are individuals, 
from whose general habits of observation, and principles of judgment,&#150; 189 
&#150; it might have been supposed a more just conclusion would have been 
formed, who have occasionally described them as the most unsuitable agents that 
could have been employed. This mode of representation, although I do not regard 
the Missionaries or their proceedings as perfect, I consider to be far from 
just. It is not my intention to eulogize their labours, or to lavish panegyric 
upon their achievements. But in the estimate of their character, 
qualifications, and exertions, a variety of considerations ought to have a 
greater influence on the minds of those by whom they are thus represented, than 
they are sometimes allowed to exert. Missionary effort, on the extended scale 
and in the distant and comparatively unexplored field in which they attempted 
it, was an event as new among the British churches, as the broad, catholic 
principles, upon which it was undertaken, were unparalleled.<br>
<br>
 The 
authentic information possessed by many who combined in arranging the plan, as 
well as by those who attempted its execution, was not only exceedingly limited, 
but received through a medium44 that necessarily imparted a higher glow of 
colouring, than those channels through which more accurate accounts have since 
been transmitted. Many, no doubt, embarked in the enterprise, as subsequent 
events fully proved, with incorrect ideas of the work, or mistaken views of the 
qualifications necessary for its accomplishment. It is not, however, to those 
who abandoned the talks, that I refer so much, as to those who (except when 
driven from it by the approaching desolations of murderous war) maintained 
their post, and died in the field; or who, after having sustained the privation
&#150; 190 &#150; and toil of thirty years of exile from country and from home, 
are still willing to end their days among the people with whose interests and 
destiny they have identified themselves.</p> 
<p>Their family connexions may not indeed have been of the highest class, 
neither may the individuals themselves have enjoyed the advantages of a very 
liberal education, nor possessed any very extensive acquaintance with the 
world. It is only in comparatively recent times that individuals of this class 
have, by embarking personally on the arduous and self-denying work of 
propagating Christianity amongst pagan nations, exhibited some noble examples 
of Christian devotedness. Many of the first Missionaries to the South Sea 
Islands were acquainted with the most useful of the mechanic arts, which were 
adapted to produce a favourable impression upon the minds of the people. They 
had obtained a creditable English, if not a classical, education, a due 
knowledge of the scriptures, and an experimental acquaintance with the 
principles of Christianity; while some, with great mental vigour combined no 
small degree of intellectual culture. Their own improvement, and the 
preparation for instructing the people, was prosecuted contemporaneously with 
their efforts to teach the people; and the numerous and respectable 
philological and other manuscripts which these have transmitted to England, 
although never published, shew that they were far from being unqualified for 
their work.<br>
<br>
 Had the first Mission to the South Seas been composed 
entirely of individuals eminent for their scientific knowledge and classical 
attainments, they would probably have been less suitable agents than those who 
actually went; as, it may be presumed,&#150; 191 &#150; their previous habits 
of life would not have furnished the best preparatives for the privations and 
difficulties to which they would have been exposed. Yet it would undoubtedly 
have been highly advantageous to the Mission, had some such gifted individuals 
been included among its members. Such were not, however, at that time so ready, 
as they have subsequently been, to engage in the enterprise; individuals of 
this class do not appear to have understood that the highest attainments, and 
noblest powers, are best employed, and their Author most honoured, when they 
are exerted in a cause which, of all others, presents the strongest claims, and 
affords the most suitable sphere, for their successful operation. The service, 
therefore, necessarily devolved on those who were willing, under every 
accompanying disadvantage, to undertake it. They were not perhaps distinguished 
by brilliancy of genius, or loftiness of intellect; but in uncompromising 
sternness of principle, unaffected piety, ardour of devotedness, uncomplaining 
endurance of privations, (not easily comprehended by those who have always 
remained at home, or visited only civilized portions of foreign climes,) in 
undeviating perseverance, in exertion under discouragements the most protracted 
and depressing, and in plain and honest detail of their endeavours and success, 
they have been inferior to few who have been honoured to labour in the 
Missionary field. I have known some of these devoted men, who, though not 
insensible to the endearments of kindred and home, and the comforts of 
civilized life, have for years been deprived of what most would deem the 
necessaries of life. These self-denying individuals have been so destitute of a 
change of apparel, that they could not,&#150; 192 &#150; without some sacrifice 
of feeling, meet any of their own countrymen by whom the island might be 
visited; and, often rising in the morning from the rustic bed, without knowing 
whence the supplies of even native food for the day were to be derived, they 
have sent out a native servant-boy to seek for bread-fruit in the mountains, or 
to solicit a supply from the trees of some friendly chief in the neighbourhood, 
while they have repaired to the school, and pursued their daily instruction, 
cheered and encouraged only by the progress of their scholars.<br>
<br>
 Such 
are the men who have long laboured in these islands; and though others may have 
been associated with them, who have turned back, or proved themselves unequal 
to the station, where many, who stand firm at their post at home, would perhaps 
have fainted, or have fallen under the discouragements inseparable from 
it&#151;they have been faithful. They seek not the praise that cometh from man, 
but the testimony of their consciences, and the approval of Heaven; and, 
irrespective of the honour God has put upon them, they are entitled, from their 
steady and successful course, to be &#147;highly esteemed for their works' 
sake.&#148;</p>

<br>
 In the interesting state described in the preceding 
chapter, we found the inhabitants on our arrival in the early part of 1817.<br>

<br> In the afternoon of the 4th of February we sailed from Tubuai; but, in 
consequence of unfavourable winds, did not reach Tahiti till the 10th. As we 
approached its southern shore, a canoe came off with some natives, who brought 
a pig and vegetables for sale; but the wind blowing fresh, we soon passed by, 
and had little more than a glance at the people. About sunset we found 
ourselves a short distance to the northward of Point Venus, having sailed along 
the east and northern shores of Tahiti, charmed with the rich and varied 
scenery of the island, justly denominated the queen of the&#150; 194 &#150; 
Pacific, whose landscapes, though circumscribed in extent, are</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>&#147;So lovely, so adorned <br>
 With hill, and dale, and lawn, and 
winding vale,<br>
 Woodland, and stream, and lake, and rolling seas,&#148;</p> 
</blockquote> 
<p>that they are seldom surpassed, even in the fairest portions of the world.
<br> <br>
 On the morning of the 16th of February, 1817, as the light of the 
day broke upon us, we discovered that during the night we had drifted to a 
considerable distance from the island; the canoes of the natives, however, soon 
surrounded our vessel; numbers of the people were admitted on board, and we had 
the long desired satisfaction of intercourse with them, through the medium of 
an interpreter. They were not altogether so prepossessing in person, as, from 
the different accounts I had read, I had been led to anticipate. The impression 
produced by our first interview was, notwithstanding, far from being 
unfavourable; we were at once gratified with their vivacity, and soon after 
with the simple indications of the piety which several exhibited. A 
good-looking native, about forty years of age, who said his name was Maine, and 
who came on board as a pilot, we invited to our breakfast. We had nearly 
finished, when he took his seat at the table; yet, before tasting his food, he 
modestly bent his head, and, shading his brow with his hand, implored the 
Divine blessing on the provision before him. Several of the officers were much 
affected at his seriousness; and though one attempted to raise a smile at his 
expense, it only elicited from him an expression of compassion. To me it was 
the most pleasing sight I had yet beheld, and imparted a higher zest to the 
enjoyment&#150; 195 &#150; I experienced in gazing on the island, as we sailed 
along its shores.<br>
<br>
 Midday was past before we entered Matavai bay. As 
we sailed into the harbour, we passed near the coral reef, on which Captain 
Wallis struck on the 19th of June, 1767, when he first entered the bay. His 
ship remained stationary nearly an hour; and, in consequence of this 
circumstance, the reef has received the name of the Dolphin rock. As we passed 
by it, we felt grateful that the winds were fair and the weather calm, and that 
we had reached our anchorage in safety.<br>
<br>
 Matavai is rather an open 
bay, and although screened from the prevailing trade winds, is exposed to the 
southern and westerly gales, and also to a considerable swell from the sea. The 
long flat neck of land which forms its northern boundary, was the spot on which 
Captain Cook erected his tents, and fixed his instruments for observing the 
transit of Venus; on which account, it has ever since been called Point Venus. 
Excepting those parts enclosed as gardens or plantations, the land near the 
shore is covered with long grass, or a species of convolvulus, called by the 
natives pohue; numerous clumps of trees, and waving cocoa - nuts, add much to 
the beauty of its appearance. A fine stream, rising in the interior mountains, 
winds through the sinuosities of the head of the valley, and, fertilizing the 
district of Matavai, flows through the centre of this long neck of land, into 
the sea.<br>
<br>
 Such, without much alteration, in all probability, was the 
appearance of this beautiful bay, when discovered by Captain Wallis, in 1767; 
and two years after, when first visited by Captain Cook; or when Captain Bligh, 
in the Bounty, spent six&#150; 196 &#150; months at anchor here in 1788 and 
1789; when Captain Vancouver arrived in 1792; Captain New, of the 
D&aelig;dalus, in 1793; and Captain Wilson, in the Duff, who anchored in the 
same bay on the 6th of March, 1797.<br>
<br>
 It was on the northern shores of 
this bay, that eighteen of the Missionaries, who left England in the Duff, 
first landed, upwards of thirty years ago.<br>
<br>
 And, although the scene 
before me was now one of loveliness and quietude, cheerful, yet placid as the 
smooth waters of the bay, that scarcely rippled by the vessel's side, it has 
often worn a very different aspect. Here the first Missionaries frequently 
heard the song accompanying the licentious Areois dance, the deafening noise of 
idol worship, and saw the human victim carried by for sacrifice: here, too, 
they often heard the startling cry of war, and saw their frighted neighbours 
fly before the murderous spear and plundering hand of lawless power. The 
invaders torch reduced the native hut to ashes, while the lurid flame seared 
the green foliage of the trees, and clouds of smoke, rising up among their 
groves, darkened for a time surrounding objects. On such occasions, and they 
were not infrequent, the contrast between the country and the inhabitants must 
have been most affecting, appearing as if the demons of darkness had lighted up 
infernal fires, even in the bowers of paradise.<br>
<br>
 Most of the islanders 
who had boarded us in the morning continued in the ship, others arrived as we 
approached the bay; and long before we anchored, our decks were crowded with 
natives. Our prepossessions in their favour continued to increase, and we 
viewed them with no ordinary&#150; 197 &#150; interest, as those among whom we 
were to spend the remainder of our days. Many of them wore some article of 
European dress, and all were attired in native cloth, though several had only a
<i>maro</i>, or broad girdle, round the waist. There was a degree of openness 
in their countenances, and vivacity in their manners, which was not unpleasing.
<br> <br>
 We had not been long at anchor, before Pomare sent us a large <i>
albicore</i>, and a variety of provisions, and shortly after came on board. I 
was struck with his tall and almost gigantic appearance; he was upwards of six 
feet high, and seemed about forty years of age. His forehead was rather 
prominent and high, his eyebrows narrow, well defined, and nearly straight; his 
hair, which was combed back from his forehead, and the sides of his face, was 
of a glossy black colour, slightly curled behind; his eyes were small, 
sometimes appearing remarkably keen, at others rather heavy; his nose was 
straight, and the nostrils by no means large, his lips were thick, and his chin 
projecting. He was arrayed in a handsome tiputa, of native manufacture. His 
body was stout, but not disproportioned to his height; and his limbs, though 
well formed, were not firm and muscular. He welcomed me to Tahiti; but, at the 
same time, appeared disappointed when he learned that only one Missionary had 
arrived, having been led to expect several. His acquaintance with English was 
very partial, and mine with Tahitian much more so; our conversation was, 
consequently, neither free nor animated. He inquired after King George, 
Governor Macquarrie, and Mr. Marsden; the time of our departure from New 
Holland; the nature of our voyage, &amp;c. These&#150; 198 &#150; inquiries I 
answered, and handed him a number of small presents which I had brought from 
England, adding a curious penknife of my own, which he had appeared desirous to 
possess. He had a small English Bible, and, at his request, I read to him one 
or two chapters. He appeared to understand, in some degree, the English 
language, although unable to speak it. After spending some time in the cabin, 
the king went to see the cattle we had brought from New South Wales, and 
particularly a horse, which the owners of the ship had sent him as a present.
<br> <br>
 Pomare was greatly delighted with the horse; and, in the course of 
the afternoon, the poor animal, after having been hung in slings, and unable to 
lie down during the greater part of the voyage, was hoisted out of the hold, to 
be taken ashore in a large pair of canoes which the king had ordered alongside 
for that purpose. During this transition, while the horse was suspended midway 
between the gangway and the yard-arm, some of the bandages gave way; when the 
animal, after hanging some time by the neck and fore-legs, to the great terror 
both of Pomare and the captain, slipped through the slings, and, clearing the 
ship's side, fell into the sea. He instantly rose to the surface; and, 
snorting, as if glad, even under these circumstances, to gain his freedom, swam 
towards the shore; but the natives no sooner saw him at liberty, than they 
plunged into the water, and followed like a shoal of sharks or porpoises after 
him. Some seizing his mane, others his tail, endeavoured to hold him, till the 
terrified creature appeared in great danger of a watery grave. The captain 
lowered down the boat; the king shouting, directed the natives to leave the 
horse to himself; but&#150; 199 &#150; his voice was lost amid the din and 
clamour of the crowds that accompanied the exhausted and frightened animal to 
the land. At length he reached the beach in safety; and, as he rose out of the 
water, the natives on the shore fled with precipitation, climbing the trees, or 
crouching behind the rocks and the bushes for security. When, however, they saw 
one of the seamen, who had landed with the captain from the ship, take hold of 
the halter that was on his neck, they returned, to gratify their curiosity. 
Most of them had heard of horses, and some of them had, perhaps, seen those 
belonging to Mai, (Omai,) landed on the island by Captain Cook, forty years 
before; but it was undoubtedly the first animal of the kind the greater part of 
them had ever seen.<br>
<br>
 The king had not been long on board, when the 
queen arrived, and was ushered into the cabin. Her person was about the middle 
stature; her complexion fairer than any other native I have seen; her form 
elegant, and her whole appearance prepossessing. Her voice, however, was by no 
means soft, and her manners were less engaging than those of several of her 
companions. She was habited in a light loose and flowing dress of beautifully 
white native cloth, tastefully fastened on the left shoulder, and reaching to 
the ankle: her hair was rather lighter than that of the natives in general; and 
on her head she wore a light and elegant native bonnet, of green and yellow 
cocoa-nut leaves; each ear was perforated, and in the perforation two or three 
flowers of the fragrant<i>Cape jessamine</i> were inserted. She was accompanied 
by her sister, Pomare-vahine. Aimata, the young princess, only daughter of 
Pomare and the queen, who appeared about six years of age, was brought by her 
nurse, and followed&#150; 200 &#150; by her attendants into the cabin. We 
delivered the few presents we had brought for them, regretting that we could 
not enter into conversation. They spent about two hours on board; and then, 
followed by their numerous retinue, returned to the shore.<br>
<br>
 Soon after 
sunrise the next morning, our vessel was surrounded with canoes, and provisions 
in abundance were offered for barter. Pomare also sent us a present.<br>
<br>
 
About nine o'clock, I saw crowds of natives repairing towards the place where 
the horse had been tied up, in charge of one of Pomare's favourite chiefs; and 
shortly afterwards he was led out, while the multitude gazed at him with great 
astonishment. Soon after breakfast, our captain landed with the saddle and 
bridle, and other presents, which Mr. Birnie, of Sydney, had sent out with the 
horse. They were delivered to Pomare, who requested that the saddle and bridle 
might be put on the horse, and that the captain would ride him. His wishes were 
complied with, and the multitude appeared highly delighted when they saw the 
animal walking and running along the beach, with the captain on his back. They 
called him<i>buaa-horo-fenua</i> and <i>buaa-afai-taata</i>; land-running pig, 
and man-carrying pig. About midday the captain returned to the ship; and we 
shortly afterwards weighed anchor, and sailed for the island of Eimeo.</p> 
<p>We enjoyed a most delightful sail along the northern part of Eimeo the next 
morning, and soon after twelve o'clock anchored in the spacious and charming 
bay of Opunohu, or, as it is usually called by foreigners, The harbour to Taloo.
<br> <br>
 Long before we anchored, Messrs. Bicknell, &#150; 201 &#150; Wilson, 
Henry, and Davies, came on board, followed by the other members of the Mission, 
who greeted our arrival with satisfaction. We accompanied them to the shore, 
and landed on the western side of the bay, in the afternoon of the 13th of 
February, 1817, happy, under circumstances of health and comfort, to enter upon 
our field of future labour, and grateful for the merciful providence by which 
we had been conducted in safety to the end of our long and eventful voyage.<br>

<br> On reaching the habitations of the Missionaries, we were cordially 
welcomed to their society, and were rejoiced to behold them cheered by the 
intelligence we had brought, and the prospect of receiving a still greater 
accession to their numbers. The evening passed pleasantly and rapidly away; 
many of the pious inhabitants and chiefs, in the neighbourhood, came to greet 
our arrival, with evident emotions of delight; among them was one, whose 
salutation I shall never forget: &#147;<i>Ia ora na oe i te Atua, Ia ora oe i 
te haere raa mai io nei, no te Aroha o te Atua ce i tae mai ai</i>;' 
&#147;Blessing on you from God, peace to you in coming here, on account of the 
love of God are you come.&#148; These were his words. His person was tall and 
commanding, his hair black and curling, his eyes benignant, and his whole 
countenance beamed with a joy that declared his tongue only obeyed the dictates 
of his heart. His name was AUNA, a native of Raiatea, formerly an Areoi and a 
warrior, who had arrived, with numbers of his countrymen, to the support of 
Pomare, after his expulsion from Tahiti, but whose heart had been changed by 
the power of the gospel of Christ. He was afterwards associated&#150; 202 &#150;
 with us at Huahine, subsequently became my fellow-labourer in the Sandwich 
Islands, and was, when I last heard from the islands, about to be ordained 
pastor of a Christian church in Sir Charles Sander's Island.<br>
<br>
 At a 
late hour we retired to rest, but not to sleep. We needed and sought repose, 
but the incidents of the day had produced a degree of excitement that did not 
speedily subside; in addition to which, the constant and loud roaring of the 
surf kept us awake till nearly daybreak. The house in which we lodged was near 
the shore; and the long heavy billows of the sea rolling in successive surges 
over the coral reefs that surround the island, kept up, through the night, a 
hollow and heavy sound, resembling that produced by the rumbling of carriages 
in a vast city, heard at a distance in the stillness of evening. The wall, or 
outside of the dwelling, was composed only of large sticks, or poles, placed 
perpendicularly from the floor to the roof, two or three inches apart, so that 
we could see the ocean on one side, and the dark outline of the inland 
mountains on the other; while looking up through the roof, which was, in this 
respect, like Ossian's ghost, we discerned the stars twinkling in a blue and 
cloudless sky. We did not, however, feel the air too cool; and our lodging was 
quite as good as that in which the Missionaries to the Sandwich Islands passed 
their first night in Honoruru; and much better than Mr. Marsden, and his 
companion, procured in New Zealand. The first night he passed on shore, he 
slept on the earthen floor, by the side of a warrior, the murder of the crew of 
the Boyd, and a cannibal; and the spot on which he lay was encircled by native 
spears fixed in the ground.</p> 
<p>&#150; 203 &#150;</p> 
<p>In the morning we arose somewhat refreshed; and, in the course of the day, 
landed our goods from the vessel. A house had been prepared, by the king, for 
the expected Missionaries; but, as it was damp, and our residence at Papetoai 
was not likely to be permanent, we took up our abode in a dwelling already 
occupied in part by Mr. Crook and his family.<br>
<br>
 I was astonished at the 
accounts I now received, of the change that had taken place among the people. 
The profession of Christianity was general, many had learned to read, and were 
teaching others; all were regular in their exercises of devotion; and, in many 
of the small gardens attached to the native houses, it was pleasing to see the 
little<i>fare bure huna</i>, house for hidden prayer. The Missionaries, who, in 
1812, had returned from Port Jackson, were joined in 1816 by Mr. Crook, who had 
been formerly stationed by Captain Wilson in the Marquesas. They had visited 
Tahiti, for the purpose of preaching to the inhabitants, but they had not been 
able to re-establish the Mission in their original station, and were, 
consequently, all residing at Eimeo when we arrived.<br>
<br>
 The chiefs of 
the district, and island, soon visited us, received a few articles as presents, 
and appeared highly gratified with what they saw, especially with some 
engravings of natural history. They sent us a present of food; or, as they call 
it, &#147;faaamua,&#148; a feeding; consisting of two or three large pigs, 
which were dragged along by force, squalling all the way, and tied to a stick 
near the door; a number of bunches of plantains, bananas, cocoa-nuts, and 
bread-fruit, were also brought, and piled up in three heaps on the sand, near 
the pigs. I was then called out, and a native repeated&#150; 204 &#150; the 
names of the chiefs who had sent us the food; and, pointing to the heaps of 
fruit and the pigs, said one was for me, and another for Mrs. Ellis, and the 
third for our infant daughter. He then directed the native servants of the 
house to take care of it, and departed.<br>
<br>
 Soon after my arrival, I 
visited the school, and was greatly delighted to behold numbers of adults, as 
well as children, under the direction of Messrs. Davies and Tessier, learning 
their alphabet and their spelling, or reading with distinctness their lessons, 
which were principally extracts from Scripture.<br>
<br>
 The building, in 
which they were taught, stood near the sea-beach, under the shade of a clump of 
cocoa-nut trees. Though of no very durable kind, it appeared well adapted for 
the purpose to which it was appropriated. It was upwards of sixty feet long, 
but rather narrow. The thatch was composed of the leaves of the<i>pandanus</i>, 
neatly fastened on rafters of<i>purau</i> or hibiscus, and the walls, or sides 
and ends, were formed with straight branches resembling the rafters, and 
planted in the ground about two inches asunder. There was a door at each end; 
windows were altogether unnecessary in such a building, as the space between 
the poles, forming the outside, admitted light and air in abundance; and wind, 
with rain, sometimes in larger quantities than was quite agreeable. The floor, 
which was of sand, was covered with long dry grass. A rustic sort of table, or 
desk, between three and four feet high, stood on one side, equally distant from 
each end, and the whole of the building was filled with low forms, on which the 
natives were sitting; while on one side I saw one or two forms longer and&#150; 
205 &#150; broader than the rest, with small ledges on the sides, filled with 
sand, for the purpose of teaching writing after the manner of the national 
schools in England. A number of pillars in the centre supported the ridge-pole, 
or rather the different ridge-poles, which unitedly sustained the roof. The 
different joints in these, and the narrow horizontal boards supporting the 
bottoms of the rafters, presented a kind of chronological index to the history 
of the place. It was first erected by the liberality of a gentleman in London. 
He presented to Tapioi, the Marquesan youth who accompanied Mr. Bicknell to 
England, the articles with which the natives were hired to build this first 
school and chapel in Eimeo. It was then much more compact, and the width better 
proportioned than it now appeared. It had always been employed, not only as a 
school, but also as a chapel. When the number of scholars and worshippers of 
the true God increased, so as to render accommodation difficult, one of the 
ends had been taken down, a new piece of timber joined to the ridgepole, the 
building lengthened about twelve or fifteen feet, and the end then closed up. 
When the place became again too small, a similar enlargement had been made; 
and, as the new piece which supported the roof, was laid upon the former 
ridge-pole, it distinctly marked the increase of Christian worshippers at the 
place within the last four or five years.<br>
<br>
 The first Sabbath I spent 
in the islands, was a day of deep and delightful interest. The Missionaries 
were accustomed to meet for prayer at sunrise, on the morning of the Sabbath. 
This service I attended, and was also gratified to find, that not fewer than 
four of five hundred of the natives,&#150; 206 &#150; imitating their teachers 
in this respect, met for the purpose of praise and supplication to the true 
God, during the interval of public worship, which was held early in the 
morning, and at four in the afternoon.<br>
<br>
 About a quarter before nine in 
the morning, I accompanied Mr. Crook to the public worship of the natives, held 
in the same house in which I had visited the school a day or two before. It 
was, indeed, a rude and perishable building, totally destitute of every thing 
imposing in effect, or exquisite in workmanship; yet I beheld it with emotions 
of pleasure, as the first roof under which the natives of Tahiti had assembled, 
in any number, to receive the elements of useful knowledge, to listen with 
attention and satisfaction to the word of God, and to render publicly unto Him 
their grateful praise; for,</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>&#147;Though gilded domes, and splendid fanes, <br>
 And costly robes, and 
choral strains,<br>
 And altars richly dress'd; <br>
 And sculptur'd saints, 
and sparkling gems,<br>
 And mitred priests, and diadems, <br>
 Inspire with 
awe the breast:</p> 
<p>&#147;'Tis not the pageantry of show <br>
 That can impart devotion's glow, 
<br> Nor sanctify a prayer. <br>
 The soul enlarged, devout, sincere, <br>
 
With equal piety draws near<br>
 The holy house of God, <br>
 That rudely rears 
its rustic head,<br>
 Scarce higher than the Indian's shed; <br>
 By Indians 
only trod.&#148;</p> </blockquote> 
<p>The place was thronged with people, and numbers were standing or sitting 
round the doors and the outside of the building. When we arrived, they readily 
made way for us to enter; when a scene,&#150; 207 &#150; destitute indeed of 
magnificence and splendour as to the structure itself, or the richness in 
personal adornment of its inmates, but certainly the most delightful and 
affecting I had ever beheld, appeared before me. Between five and six hundred 
native Christians were there assembled, to worship the true God. Their persons 
were cleanly, their apparel neat, their countenances either thoughtful, or 
beaming with serenity and gladness. The heads of the men were uncovered, their 
hair cut and combed, and their beards shaven. Their dress was generally a<i>
pareu</i> round the waist; and a native <i>tiputa</i> over their shoulders, 
which covered the upper part of the body, excepting the arms. The appearance of 
the females was equally interesting; most of them wore a neat and tasteful 
bonnet, made with the rich yellow-tinted cocoa-nut leaf. Their countenances 
were open and lively; many had a small bunch of the fragrant and delicately 
white gradenia, or<i>Cape jessamine</i> flowers, in their hair; in addition to 
which, several of their chief women wore two or three fine native pearls 
fastened together with finely braided human hair, and hanging pendent from one 
of their ears, while the other was adorned with a native flower. Their dress 
was remarkably modest and becoming, being generally what they term<i>ahu bu</i>
, which consists of large quantities of beautifully white native cloth, wound 
round the body, then passed under one arm, and fastened on the other shoulder, 
leaving uncovered only the neck and face, and part of one arm.<br>
<br>
 The 
assembly maintained the most perfect silence, until Mr. Davies, who officiated 
on the occasion, and was seated behind the table, which answered the double 
purpose of a desk for the schoolmaster,&#150; 208 &#150; and a pulpit for the 
minister, rose, and gave out a hymn in the native language. The whole 
congregation now stood, and many of them joined in the singing. A prayer was 
then offered, during which the congregation remained standing; another hymn was 
sung; the people then sat down, and listened attentively to a discourse, 
delivered by the Missionary standing on the ground behind the desk. When this 
was ended, a short prayer was offered, the benediction pronounced, and the 
service closed. The assembly dispersed with the utmost propriety and order; 
many of them, as they passed by, cordially shook me by the hand, and expressed 
their joy at seeing me among them. My joy, and excitement of feeling, was not 
less than theirs. There was something so pleasing and novel in their 
appearance, so peculiar in their voices when singing, and in their native 
language, both during the prayers and sermon, and something so solemn and 
earnest in their attention, with such an air of sincerity and devotion during 
the whole service, that it deeply affected my heart. I was desirous of speaking 
to them in return, and expressing the grateful satisfaction with which I had 
beheld their worship; but the scene before me had taken such a powerful hold of 
my feelings, that I returned home in silence, filled with astonishment at the 
change that had taken place, and deeply impressed with the evidence it afforded 
of the efficacy of the gospel, and the power of the Almighty. At eleven o'clock 
I attended public worship in the English language.<br>
<br>
 At four in the 
afternoon the natives again assembled, and I attended at their worship. Though 
I could not understand their language, I was pleased with the large attendance, 
and the serious and&#150; 209 &#150; earnest manner in which the people 
listened to an animated discourse delivered by Mr. Nott. In the evening several 
of the Missionaries met for social worship, and with this sacred exercise we 
closed our first Sabbath in the Society Islands, under a deep impression of the 
advantages of Christianity, and the pleasing effects, which we had that day 
witnessed, of Divine influence over the hearts of the most profligate idolaters.
<br> <br>
 In the afternoon of the succeeding Sabbaths, I visited a number of 
Christian chiefs at their own houses. We usually found them either reading 
together, conversing on the contents of their books, or some other religious 
subject. At Hitoti's dwelling, which I visited on the second Sabbath after my 
arrival, the household were about to kneel down for prayer when we entered; we 
joined them, and several of the petitions which the chief offered up to God, 
appeared, when interpreted by my companion, remarkably appropriate and 
expressive.<br>
<br>
 In the course of my first week on shore, I made several 
excursions in different parts of the district. The soil, in all the level part 
of the valley, was a rich vegetable mould, with a small portion of alluvial, 
washed down from the surrounding hills, which are generally covered with a 
stiff kind of loam or brownish-red ochre. Several large plantations were well 
stocked with the different productions of the island; but a large portion of 
the valleys adjacent to the settlement, were uncultivated, and covered with 
grass or brush-wood, growing with all the rank luxuriance that a humid 
atmosphere, a tropical sun, and a fertile soil, would combine to produce.<br>

<br> I also accompanied one of the Missionaries on &#150; 210 &#150; voyage to 
the opposite side of the island, about twenty miles distant from the settlement 
at Papetoai. Two natives paddled our light single canoe along the smooth water 
within the reefs, till we reached Moru, where we landed, to take some 
refreshment at the house of a friendly chief. This was the first native meal I 
had sat down to, and it was served up in true Tahitian style. When the food was 
ready, we were requested to seat ourselves on the dry grass that covered the 
floor of the house. A number of the broad leaves of the purau, hibiscus 
tileaceus, having the stalks plucked off close to the leaf, were then spread on 
the ground, in two or three successive layers, with the downy or under side 
upwards, and two or three were handed by a servant to each individual, instead 
of a plate. By the side of these vegetable plates, a small cocoa-nut shell of 
salt water was placed for each person. Quantities of fine large bread-fruit, 
roasted on hot stones, were now peeled and brought in, and a number of fish 
that had been wrapped in plantain leaves, and broiled on the embers, were 
placed beside them. A bread-fruit and a fish was handed to each individual, 
and, having implored a blessing, we began to eat, dipping every mouthful of 
bread-fruit or fish into the small vessel of salt water,&#151;without which, to 
the natives, it would have been unsavoury and tasteless. I opened the leaves, 
and found the fish nicely broiled; and, imitating the practice of those around 
me, dipped several of the first pieces I took into the dish placed by my side: 
but there was a bitterness in the sea water which rendered it rather 
unpalatable, I therefore dispensed with the further use of it, and finished my 
meal with the bread-fruit and fish.</p> 
<p>&#150; 211 &#150;</p> 
<p>About two o'clock in the afternoon we resumed our journey; travelling 
sometimes along the seabeach, and at other times availing ourselves of the 
canoe until near sunset, when we reached Afareaitu, and created by our arrival 
no small stir among the people.<br>
<br>
 The next morning we examined the 
district, and were delighted with its fertility, extent, and resource. 
Afareaitu is on the eastern side of Eimeo, opposite the district of Atehuru in 
Tahiti, and is certainly one of the finest districts in the island. It 
comprises two valleys, or rather one large valley partially divided by a narrow 
hilly ridge extending from the mountains in the interior, towards the shore. 
The soil of the bottom of the valley is rich and fertile, well stocked with 
cocoa-nuts and breadfruit trees. The surrounding hills are clothed with shrubs 
or grass, and the lofty and romantic mountains, forming the central boundary, 
are adorned with trees or bushes even to their summits. Several broad cascades 
flowed in silvery streams down the sides of the mountain, and, broken 
occasionally by a jutting rock, presented their sparkling waters in beautiful 
contrast with the rich and dark foliage of the stately trees, and the flowering 
shrubs that bordered their progress. A number of streams originating in these 
water-falls pursued their course through the valley, and one, receiving in its 
way the tributary waters of a number of sequestered streamlets, swelled at 
times into what in these islands might be called a river, and flowed along the 
most fertile portions of the district to the sea.<br>
<br>
 A small bay was 
formed by an elliptical indentation of the coast; an opening in the reef 
opposite the bay admitted small vessels to enter, and a picturesque little 
coral island, adorned with two or&#150; 212 &#150; three clumps of hibiscus and 
cocoa-nut trees, added greatly to the beauty of its appearance. There was no 
swamp or marshy land between the shore and the mountains; the ground was high, 
and the whole district not only remarkably beautiful, but apparently dry and 
healthy. The abundance of natural productions, the apparent salubrity of the 
air, the convenience of the stream of water, the facility of the harbour, 
combined to recommend it as an eligible spot for at least the temporary 
residence of a part of the Missionaries. We therefore waited on the principal 
chiefs, one of whom had accompanied us from Papetoai, and inquired if it would 
be agreeable to them for us to come and reside there. They expressed themselves 
pleased with the prospect of such an event, and promised every assistance in 
the erection of our houses, &amp;c. Having accomplished the object of our 
visit, we left Afareaitu, and returned to Papetoai the same evening.<br>
<br>
 
The circumstances of the inhabitants of the windward and leeward islands, most 
of whom had renounced idolatry, and their earnest desire to receive religious 
instruction, rendered it exceedingly desirable that the Missionaries should no 
longer remain altogether at Papetoai, but establish themselves in the different 
islands; but the vessel which they had commenced building in 1813, being still 
unfinished, and the anticipation of a considerable accession to their numbers, 
induced them to defer forming any new station, until such reinforcement should 
arrive.<br>
<br>
 The natives in the several islands were in want, not only of 
teachers, but also of books. I had taken out a printing-press and types, and 
having, at the request of the Directors, learned the art of&#150; 213 &#150; 
printing in England, it was proposed, that, as a temporary measure, to supply 
the existing demand for books, the press should be set up at Afareaitu. By this 
arrangement two stations would be formed in Eimeo, and the whole of the 
inhabitants be brought more fully under religious instruction. In order to 
carry these plans into effect, we left Papetoai on the 25th of March, with Mr. 
Davies, Mr. and Mrs. Crook, and family. Mrs. Ellis, and myself, with an infant 
and her nurse, set out in a native canoe, having most of our goods and luggage 
on board. Mr. Crook and family preceded us in a fine large double canoe, called 
Tiaitoerau, literally, &#147;wait for the west wind,&#148; from<i>tiai</i> to 
wait, and<i>toerau</i> west wind.<br>
<br>
 The wind was contrary when we 
started; and, after proceeding only five miles, we landed at Tiataepuaa, the 
usual residence of the chiefs of Eimeo. Here we found Mr. Crook and his family 
waiting our arrival, to join in partaking of the breakfast they had prepared.
<br> <br>
 As soon as our men had refreshed themselves, we embarked in our 
respective canoes, and, resuming our voyage, proceeded along the smooth surface 
of the sea between the reefs and the shore. The wind died away, and a perfect 
calm succeeded. The heat of the sun was intense, and its scorching effect on 
our faces was increased by the reflection of the sea. This considerably 
diminished the pleasure we derived from watching, through the perfectly 
transparent waters, the playful movement of the shoals of small and variegated 
rockfish, of every rich and glowing hue, which often shone in brilliant 
contrast with the novel and beautiful groves of many-coloured coral, that 
rendered the sandy bottom of the sea, though frequently &#150; 214 &#150; 
several fathoms beneath us, in appearance at least, an extensive and charming 
submarine shrubbery, or flower-garden. The corallines were spread out with all 
the endless variety and wild independence exhibited in the verdant landscape of 
the adjacent shore.<br>
<br>
 The heat of the sun, and the oppressiveness of 
the atmosphere, with the labour of rowing with their paddles our heavily laden 
canoes every inch of the way, had so fatigued our men, that when we reached 
A-ti-ma-ha, fifteen miles from the place whence we started in the morning, we 
deemed in expedient to land for the night.<br>
<br>
 I took a ramble through 
the district a short time before sunset, and was delighted with the wild and 
romantic beauty of the surrounding scenery,&#151;the luxuriant groves of trees, 
and the shrubs, that now covered the fertile parts of this almost uninhabited 
district. In every part I met with sections of pavement, and other vestiges of 
former inhabitants; and was deeply affected, witnessing the depopulation thus 
indicated, and which is found to have taken place throughout the island.<br>

<br> Notwithstanding the total absence of every thing resembling accommodation 
in our lodging, where we spread our bed upon the ground, we should probably 
have enjoyed a night of refreshing sleep, but for the mosquitoes. In these 
thinly peopled, damp, and woody districts, they are exceedingly numerous and 
annoying, especially to those who have recently arrived; and although during my 
subsequent residence in the island, I was less incommoded by them, I was on 
this occasion glad to escape their noise, &amp;c. by leaving the house soon 
after midnight, and walking along the shore, or sitting on the beach until 
day-break.</p> 
<p>&#150; 215 &#150; Heavy showers detained us at Atimaha until ten o'clock in 
the forenoon, when we pursued our voyage. At Maatea I landed about twelve 
o'clock, and walked through the district of Haume to Afareaitu. The wind was 
contrary throughout the day, and it was near sunset before Mrs. Ellis and our 
little girl, with her nurse, arrived in the canoe. We had suffered much from 
exposure to the sun, and from the fatigue of our tedious voyage; we were, 
however, thankful to have reached our destination in safety. The natives 
cheerfully gave up a large oval-shaped house for our accommodation: Mr. and 
Mrs. Crook occupied one end of it, and we took up our abode in the other. The 
floor was of earth; upon this we spread some clean white sand, which was 
covered over with plaited leaves of the cocoa-nut tree. There were no 
partitions; but by hanging up some mats and native cloth, we soon succeeded in 
partitioning off a comfortable bed-room, sitting-room, and store-room. Our 
kitchen was the open yard behind the dwelling; and its only fixtures were a 
couple of a large stones placed in the ground, parallel to each other, and 
about six inches apart. This was our stove, or fire-place, and, during the dry 
season, answered tolerably well.<br>
<br>
 With the study of the language, the 
erection of a printing-office and a dwelling-house now demanded my attention. A 
spot near the principal stream was selected for their site; the inhabitants of 
the district undertook ot build the printing-office, while the king's people, 
and the inhabitants of Maatea, agreed to put up the frame of my dwelling-house. 
The acquisition of the language I commenced with Mr. Crook, and was happy to 
avail myself of the aid of Mr. Davies, who was&#150; 216 &#150; well acquainted 
with it, and willing to render us every assistance which his other avocations 
would admit.<br>
<br>
 The natives of Afareaitu, and the neighbouring 
districts, were rejoiced at our coming among them; they seemed a people 
predisposed to receive instruction. A spacious chapel was erected prior to our 
arrival, and a large school was subsequently built; multitudes from other parts 
of the island took up their abode in the settlement, the school was filled with 
scholars, and the chapel well attended.<br>
<br>
 The indigenous productions of 
the island were abundant in the neighbourhood, and were comparatively cheap, as 
this part of the island had been but little visited by foreigners. When the 
flour, and other foreign articles of provision which we had brought from Port 
Jackson, were nearly expended, we subsisted almost entirely on native food; and 
though most of it was rather unsavoury at first, it afterwards became tolerably 
palatable. Wheat is not grown in any of the islands; it has often been tried, 
but, either form the heat of the climate, the exceeding fertility of the soil, 
or the absence of regular seasons, it has always failed. No other kind of 
grain, with the exception of a small quantity of maize, or Indian corn, is 
cultivated. Flour is, consequently, now only to be obtained from vessels 
visiting the islands. It is however, frequently brought from New South Wales, 
and from South or North America, and a tolerably good supply may, in general, 
be obtained.<br>
<br>
 From the enumeration already given of the articles of 
diet procurable among the islands, it will be evident, that though neither 
wheat, oats,&#150; 217 &#150; barley, peas, and beans, nor other pulse and 
grain, are grown, yet the aborigines with a moderate degree of labour may 
obtain the necessaries, and many of what are by them esteemed the luxuries, of 
life. Their diet and modes of living are, however, still very different from 
those to which a European has been accustomed, and which he finds, even in 
their altered climate, most conducive to his health. In this respect, the first 
Missionaries endured far greater privations than those who have since joined 
them. They were often without tea and sugar, had no other animal food than that 
which they procured in common with the natives, and but seldom obtained flour. 
For some years after our arrival in the islands, the supply of this last 
article was very inadequate and uncertain; we have been months at a time 
without tasting it, either in the form of bread or any other preparation. The 
supply now procured is, however, more regular, and the introduction of goats 
furnishing milk, and the flesh of the kid, the feeding of cattle, by which 
means the residents are able to make butter, and occasionally to kill an ox, 
has greatly improved their circumstances.</p>

<br> <br>
 In a short time after our arrival at Afareaitu, the people began to 
erect the printing-office, and the frame of our dwelling. According to the 
directions of the king, and the arrangements among themselves, the work was 
divided between several parties. The people of Afareaitu erected the 
printing-office; and those of Maatea, a neighbouring district, my dwelling. The 
king wrote a letter to the chief of the district, hastening him in the 
undertaking, and in a few weeks came over himself, in order to encourage the 
parties engaged in the work, which advanced with celerity, and was in a short 
time completed.<br>
<br>
 When the printing-office was finished, as the <i>purau
</i> branches composing the walls afforded but an indifferent shelter from the 
rain and wind the&#150; 219 &#150; sides of the printing-office were boarded, 
and one or two glass windows introduced; probably the first ever seen in Eimeo. 
The floor was covered partly with the trunks of trees split in two, and partly 
paved with stone. In searching for suitable stones, we pulled down the 
remaining ruins of one or two<i>maraes</i> in the neighbourhood, and, finding 
among them a number of smooth and level-surfaced basaltic stones, we were happy 
to remove them from the temple, and fix them in the pavement of the 
printing-office floor; thus appropriating them to a purpose very different 
indeed from that for which they were primarily designed, by those who had 
evidently prepared them with considerable labour and care.<br>
<br>
 Numbers of 
the inhabitants of several parts of Tahiti and Eimeo flocked to Afareaitu, to 
attend the means of instruction, and the public ordinances of religion, as it 
was more convenient to many than Papetoai. They were also anxious to see this 
wonderful machine, the printing-press, in operation, having heard much of the 
facility with which, when once it should be established, they would be supplied 
with articles at that time more valuable, in their estimation, than any other.
<br> <br>
 A few copies of the spelling-book printed in England had been taken 
to the island in 1811. Some hundred copies of a smaller spelling-book, and a 
brief summary of the Old and New Testament, the latter containing about 
seventy-five 12mo. pages, had been printed at Port Jackson, and were in 
circulation; but many hundreds of the natives who had learned to read, were 
still destitute of a book. Others could repeat correctly, from memory, the 
whole of the books, and were anxious for fresh ones. In many families, where 
all were scholars,&#150; 220 &#150; there was but one book; while others were 
totally destitute. The inhabitants of the neighbouring islands were in still 
greater need. I have seen many who had written out the whole of the 
spelling-book on sheets of writing paper; and others who, unable to procure 
paper, had prepared pieces of native cloth with great care, and then, with a 
reed immersed in red or purple native dye, had written out the alphabet, 
spelling, and reading lessons, on these pieces of cloth, made with the bark of 
a tree. It was also truly affecting to see many of them, not with phylacteries, 
but with portions of scripture, or the texts they had heard preached from, 
written on scraps of paper, or fragments of cloth, preserved with care, and 
read till fixed in the memory of their possessors. This state of affairs, 
together with the earnest desire of the people to increase their knowledge of 
sacred truth, rendered it desirable that the press should be set to work as 
soon as possible. Within three months after our arrival at Afareaitu, every 
thing was in readiness, and, on the 10th of June, 1817, the operations 
preparatory to printing were commenced.<br>
<br>
 Pomare, who was exceedingly 
delighted when he heard of its arrival, and had furnished every assistance in 
his power, both in the erection of the building, and the removal of the press, 
types, &amp;c. from Papetoai, where they had been landed, was not less anxious 
to see it actually at work. He had for this purpose visited Afareaitu, and, on 
his return to the other side of the island, requested that he might be sent for 
whenever we should begin. A letter having been forwarded to inform him that we 
were nearly ready, he hastened to our settlement, and, in the afternoon of the 
day appointed, came to the printing-office, accompanied by a few&#150; 221 
&#150;favourite chiefs, and followed by a large concourse of people.<br>
<br>
 
Soon after his arrival, I took the composing-stick in my hand, and, observing 
Pomare looking with curious delight at the new and shining types, I asked him 
if he would like to put together the first A B, or alphabet. His countenance 
was lighted up with evident satisfaction, as he answered in the affirmative. I 
then placed the composing-stick in his hand; he took the capital letters, one 
by one, out of their respective compartments, and, fixing them, concluded the 
alphabet. He put together the small letters in the same manner; and the few 
monosyllables, composing the first page of the small spelling-book, were 
afterwards added. He was delighted when he saw the first page complete, and 
appeared desirous to have it struck off at once; but when informed that it 
would not be printed till as many were composed as would fill a sheet, he 
requested that he might be sent for whenever it was ready. He visited us almost 
daily until the 30th, when, having received intimation that it was ready for 
the press, he came, attended by only two of his favourite chiefs. They were, 
however, followed by a numerous train of his attendants, &amp;c. who had by 
some means heard that the work was about to commence. Crowds of the natives 
were already collected around the door, but they made way for him, and, after 
he and his two companions had been admitted, the door was closed, and the small 
window next the sea darkened, as he did not wish to be overlooked by the people 
on the outside. The king examined, with great minuteness and pleasure, the form 
as it lay on the press, and prepared to try to take off the first sheet ever 
printed in his dominions.</p> 
<p>&#150; 222 &#150;</p> 
<p>Having been told how it was to be done, he jocosely charged his companions 
not to look very particularly at him, and not to laugh if he should not do it 
right. I put the printer's ink-ball into his hand, and directed him to strike 
it two or three times upon the face of the letters; this he did, and then 
placing a sheet of clean paper upon the parchment, it was covered down, turned 
under the press, and the king was directed to pull the handle. He did so, and 
when the paper was removed from beneath the press, and the covering lifted up, 
the chiefs and assistants rushed towards it, to see what effect the king's 
pressure had produced. When they beheld the letters black, and large, and well 
defined, there was one simultaneous expression of wonder and delight.<br>
<br>
 
The king took up the sheet, and having looked first at the paper and then at 
the types with attentive admiration, handed it to one of his chiefs, and 
expressed a wish to take another. He printed two more; and, while he was so 
engaged, the first sheet was shewn to the crowd without, who, when they saw it, 
raised one general shout of astonishment and joy. when the king had printed 
three or four sheets, he examined the press in all its parts with great 
attention. On being asked what he thought of it, he said it was very 
surprising; but that he had supposed, notwithstanding all the descriptions 
which had been given of its operation, that the paper was laid down, and the 
letters by some means pressed upon it, instead of the paper being pressed upon 
the types. He remained attentively watching the press, and admiring the 
facility with which, by its mechanism, so many pages were printed at one time, 
until it was near sunset, when he left us; taking with him the sheets he had
&#150; 223 &#150; printed, to his encampment on the opposite side of the bay.
<br> <br>
 When the benefits which the Tahitians have already derived from 
education, and the circulation of books, are considered, with the increasing 
advantages which it is presumed future generations will derive from the 
establishment of the press, we can not but view the introduction of printing as 
an auspicious event. The 30th of June, 1817, was, on this account, an important 
day in the annals of Tahiti; and there is no act of Pomare's life, excepting 
his abolition of idolatry, his clemency after the battle of Bunaau&iuml;aa, and 
his devotedness in visiting every district in the island, inducing the chiefs 
and people to embrace Christianity, that will be remembered with more grateful 
feeling than the circumstance of his printing the first page of the first book 
published in the South Sea Islands.<br>
<br>
 The spelling-book being most 
needed, was first put to press, and an edition of 2600 copies soon finished. 
The king with his attendants passed by the printing-office every afternoon, on 
their way to his favourite bathing-place, and seldom omitted to call, and spend 
some time in watching the progress of the letters, and appeared surprised when 
he found that, in sixteen pages of the spelling-book, there were upwards of 
five thousand of the letter a. An edition of 2300 copies of the Tahitian 
Catechism, and a Collection of Texts, or Extracts from Scripture, were next 
printed; after which, St. Luke's Gospel, which had been translated by Mr. Nott, 
was put to press.<br>
<br>
 While the spelling-book was in hand, Mr. and Mrs. 
Orsmond arrived in the islands, and took up&#150; 224 &#150; their residence at 
Afareaitu; increasing thereby the enjoyment of our social hours.<br>
<br>
 The 
first sheet of St. Luke's Gospel was nearly printed, when the Active, with six 
Missionaries from England, arrived. Among them were our fellow-voyagers, Mr. 
and Mrs. Threlkeld, and our esteemed friends Mr. and Mrs. Barff; we had parted 
with them in England, and were truly rejoiced to welcome them to the distant 
shores of our future dwelling-place. By the same vessel, a supply of printing 
paper was sent from the British and Foreign Bible Society. Its arrival was most 
providential. The paper sent by the Missionary Society was only sufficient, 
after the elementary books had been finished, to enable us to print 1500 copies 
of the Gospel; but the arrival of the liberal grant from the Bible Society 
enabled us at once to double the number of copies. Although the demand has 
increased, and larger editions of the subsequent books have been necessary, the 
British and Foreign Bible Society has generously furnished the paper for every 
subsequent portion of the Scriptures that has been printed in the islands.<br>

<br> The composition and press-work of the elementary books, and of the greater 
portion of the edition of nearly 3000 copies of St. Luke's Gospel, was 
performed almost entirely by Mr. Crook and myself. In the mean time, two 
natives were instructed to perform the most laborious parts; and, before the 
books were finished, they were able, under proper superintendence, to relieve 
us from the mechanical labour of press-work,&#151;a department in which, they 
with others have been ever since employed; receiving regular payment for the 
same. In all works subsequently published,&#150; 225 &#150; the Missionaries, 
on whom the management of printing has devolved, have been in a great measure 
relieved by the aid of those instructed in that department of this useful art.
<br> <br>
 We laboured eight, and sometimes ten, hours daily, yet found that 
the work advanced but slowly. Notwithstanding all the care that had been 
exercised in selecting the printing materials and the accompanying apparatus, 
many things were either deficient or spoiled; here we could procure no proper 
supply, and the edition was not completed until the beginning of 1818. It was 
entitled, &#147;<i>Te Evanelia na Luka, iritihia ei parau Tahiti</i>,&#148; 
literally, The Gospel of Luke, taken out to be, or transferred to, the language 
of Tahiti;<i>E-parau hae-rehia te parau maitai o te hau nei e ati paa toai te 
ao nei ia ite te mau fenua atoa</i>, was the motto. &#147;This good word (or 
gospel) of the kingdom shall be published in all the world,&#148; Matt. xxiv. 
14. and the imprint was,<i>Neneihia i te nenei raa parau a te mau Misionari</i>
, 1818. Pressed at the (paper or book) presser of the Missionaries.&#151;There 
being no term in the native language answering to the word translated Gospel, 
the Greek word Euangelion was introduced, some of the consonants being omitted 
in conforming it to the native idiom.<br>
<br>
 The curiosity awakened in the 
inhabitants of Afareaitu by the establishment of the press, was not soon 
satisfied: day after day Pomare visited the printing-office; the chiefs applied 
to be admitted inside, while the people thronged the windows, doors, and every 
crevice through which they could peep, often involuntarily exclaiming,<i>
Be-ri-ta-ni-e! fenua paar</i>i: O Britain! land of skill, or knowledge. The 
press soon became a matter of universal&#150; 226 &#150; conversation; and the 
facility with which books could be multiplied, filled the minds of the people 
in general with wonderful delight. Multitudes arrived from every district of 
Eimeo, and even from other islands, to procure books, and to see this 
astonishing machine. The excitement manifested frequently resembled that with 
which the people of England would hasten to witness, for the first time, the 
ascent of a balloon, or the movement of a steam-carriage. So great was the 
influx of strangers, that for several weeks before the first portion of the 
Scriptures was finished, the district of Afareaitu resembled a public fair. The 
beach was lined with canoes from distant parts of Eimeo and other islands; the 
houses of the inhabitants were thronged, and small parties had erected their 
temporary encampments in every direction. The school during the week, and 
chapel on the Sabbath, though capable of containing 600 persons, were found too 
small for those who sought admittance. The printing-office was daily crowded by 
the strangers, who thronged the doors, &amp;c. in such numbers, as to climb 
upon each others backs or on the sides of the windows, so as frequently to 
darken the place. The house had been enclosed with a fence five or six feet 
high; but this, instead of presenting an obstacle to the gratification of their 
curiosity, was converted into the means of facilitating it: numbers were 
constantly seen sitting on the top of the railing; whereby they were able to 
look over the heads of their companions who were round the windows.<br>
<br>
 
Among the various parties in Afareaitu, at this time, were a number of the 
natives of the Paumotu, or Pearl Islands, which lie to the northeast of Tahiti, 
and constitute what is called the&#150; 227 &#150; Dangerous Archipelago. These 
numerous islands, like those of Tetuaroa to the north, are of coralline 
formation, and the most elevated parts of many of them are seldom more than two 
or three feet above high-water mark. The principal, and almost only edible 
vegetable they produce, is the fruit of the cocoa-nut: on these, with the 
numerous kinds of fishes resorting to their shores, or found among the coral 
reefs, the inhabitants entirely subsist. They appear a hardy and industrious 
race, capable of enduring great privations. The Tahitians believe them to be 
cannibals; but as to the evidence or extent of this charge, we cannot speak 
confidently. They are in general firm and muscular, but of a more spare habit 
of body than the Tahitians. Their limbs are well formed, their stature 
generally tall. The expression of their countenance, and the outline of their 
features, greatly resemble those of the Society Islanders; their manners are, 
however, more rude and uncourteous. The greater part of the body is tataued, 
sometimes in broad stripes, or large masses of black, and always without any of 
the taste and elegance frequently exhibited in the figures marked on the 
persons of the Tahitians. By the latter, the natives of the Tahitians. By the 
latter, the natives of the Pearl Islands were formerly regarded with the 
greatest contempt, as<i>taehae</i> and <i>maua</i>, savages and barbarians. It 
was some months since they had arrived from their native islands, which they 
had left for the purpose of procuring books and teachers for their countrymen. 
From the time of their landing, Pomare had taken them under his protection; and 
when he came over to Eimeo, they followed in his train.<br>
<br>
 A 
considerable party of the Aura tribe came one day to the printing-office, to 
see the press&#150; 228 &#150; When they were admitted, and beheld the native 
printer at work, their astonishment was great. They were some time before they 
would approach very near, and appeared at a loss whether to consider the press 
as an animal or a machine. As their language is strikingly analogous to that 
spoken in the Society Islands, I entered into conversation with them. They were 
very urgent to be supplied with spelling-books, which I regretted my inability 
to effect to and extent, as our edition was nearly expended. Learning that they 
had discontinued idol-worship, I asked why they had abandoned their gods. They 
replied, that they were evil spirits, and had never done them any good, but had 
caused frequent and desolating wars. Moorea,45 they said, was their teacher, 
and had instructed them concerning the true God, for whose worship in the 
island of Anaa,46 whence most of them came, they had already erected three 
chapels.</p> 
<p>But little time was allowed for the drying of the printed sheets. The 
native were in want of books, and most eager for them: the first inquiry of 
every party that arrived, usually was, &#147;When will the books be 
ready?&#148; The presses were therefore fixed, and, having acquired some 
knowledge of bookbinding as well as printing, before leaving England, I 
proceeded, as soon as the printing was finished, to binding, though but 
inadequately furnished with materials.<br>
<br>
 The first bound copy was sent 
to Papetoai, and is still, I believe, in Mr. Nott's possession; the second, 
half-bound in red morocco, was presented&#150; 229 &#150; to the king, who 
received it with high satisfaction. The queen and chiefs were next supplied, 
and preparations made for meeting the demands of the people. In order to 
preserve the books, it was deemed inexpedient to give them into the hands of 
the natives, either unbound, or merely covered as pamphlets. We had only a 
small quantity of mill-boards, and it was necessary to increase them on the 
spot; a large quantity of native cloth, made with the bark of a tree, was 
therefore purchased, and females employed to beat a number of layers or folds 
together, usually from seven to ten. These were after submitted to the action 
of a powerful screw-press, and, when gradually dried, formed a good stiff 
pasteboard. For their binding, the few sheep-skins brought from England were 
cut into slips for the backs and corners, and a large bundle of old newspapers 
dyed, for covers to the sides. In staining these papers, they were covered over 
with the juice of the stems of the mountain plantain, or<i>fei</i>. The young 
plants brought from the mountains were generally two or three inches in 
diameter at the lower end. The root was cut off above the part that had been in 
the ground, and the stem being then fixed over a vessel, half a pint sometimes 
of thick purple juice exuded from it. This was immediately spread upon the 
paper, imparting to the sheet, when dried in the sun, a rich glossy purple 
colour, which remained as long as the paper lasted. If lime-juice was sprinkled 
upon it, a beautiful and delicate pink was produced. When the juice of the<i>fei
</i> was allowed to remain till the next day, the liquor became much thinner, 
assumed a brownish red tinge, and imparted only a slight colour to the paper.
</p> 
<p>&#150; 230 &#150;</p> 
<p>The process of binding appeared to the natives much more simple than that 
of printing; yet, in addition to those whom we were endeavouring to instruct, 
each of the principal chiefs sent one of his most clever men, to learn how to 
put a book together. For some time we bound every book that was given to the 
natives; but our materials being expended long before they were supplied, and 
the people continuing impatient for the books, even in sheets&#151;rather than 
keep them destitute of the Scripture already printed, they were thus 
distributed.<br>
<br>
 Those among the natives who had earned to bind were now 
overwhelmed with business, and derived no inconsiderable emolument from their 
trade, as they required each person to bring the pasteboard necessary for his 
own books, and also a piece of skin or leather for the back, or for the whole 
cover. Many soon learned to sew the sheets together, others cut pieces of wood 
very thin, instead of pasteboard, which were fastened to the sides; the edges 
of the leaves were then cut with a knife; and the book used in this state 
daily, while the owner was searching for a skin or a piece of leather, with 
which to cover it for more effectual preservation. This was the most difficult 
article to procure, and many books were used without it for many months.<br>

<br> Leather was now the article in greatest requisition among all classes; and 
the poor animals, that had heretofore live in undisturbed ease and freedom, 
were hunted solely for their skins. The printing-office was converted into a 
tanyard; old canoes, filled with lime-water, were prepared; and all kinds of 
skins brought to have the hair extracted, and the oily matters dissipated. It 
was&#150; 231 &#150; quite amusing to see goats' dogs' and cats' skins 
collected to be prepared for book-covers. Sometimes they procured the tough 
skin of a large dog, or an old goat, with long shaggy matted hair and beard 
attached to it, or the thin skin of a wild kitten taken in the mountains. As 
soon as the natives had seen how they were prepared, which was simply by 
extracting the hair and the oil, they did this at their own houses; and in 
walking through the district at this period, no object was more common than a 
skin stretched on a frame, and suspended on the branch of a tree, to dry in the 
sun.<br>
<br>
 All the books, hitherto in circulation among the people, had 
been gratuitously distributed; but when the first portion of Scripture was 
finished, as it was a larger book than had yet been published, it was thought 
best to require a small equivalent for it, lest the people should expect that 
books afterwards printed would be given also, and lest, from the circumstance 
of their receiving them without payment, they should be induced to undervalue 
them. A small quantity of cocoa-nut oil, the article they could most easily 
procure, was therefore demanded for each book, and cheerfully paid by every 
native. This was not done with a view of deriving any profit from the sale of 
the books, but merely to teach the people their value; as no higher price was 
required than what it was supposed would cover the expense of paper and 
printing materials,&#151;and we still continued to distribute elementary books 
gratuitously.<br>
<br>
 The season occupied in the printing and binding of 
these books was one of incessant labour, which, in a tropical climate, and at a 
season when the sun was vertical, was often found exceedingly oppressive;&#150; 
232 &#150; yet it was one of the happiest periods of my life. It was cheering 
to behold the people so prepared to receive the sacred volume, and anxious to 
possess it. I have frequently seen thirty or forty canoes from distant parts of 
Eimeo, or from some other island, lying along the beach; in each of which, five 
or six persons had arrived, whose only errand was to procure copies of the 
Scriptures. For these, many waited five or six weeks, while they were printing. 
Sometimes I have seen a canoe arrive with six or ten persons for books; who, 
when they have landed, have brought a large bundle of letters, perhaps thirty 
or forty, written on plantain leaves, and rolled up like a scroll. These 
letters had been written by individuals, who were unable to come, and apply 
personally for a book, and had therefore thus sent, in order to procure a copy. 
Often, when standing at my door, which was but a short distance from the 
sea-beach, as I have gazed on the varied beauties of the rich and glowing 
landscape, and the truly picturesque appearance of the island of Tahiti, 
fourteen or eighteen miles distant, the scene has been enlivened by the light 
and nautilus-like sail of the buoyant canoe, first seen in the distant horizon 
as a small white speck, sometimes scarcely distinguishable from the crest of 
the waters, at others brilliantly reflecting the last rays of the retiring sun, 
and appearing in bold and beautiful relief before</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>&#147;The impassioned splendour of those clouds <br>
 That wait upon the 
sun at his departure.&#148;</p> </blockquote> 
<p>The effect of this magnificent scene has often been heightened by the 
impression that the voyagers, whose approaching bark became every moment more 
conspicuous among the surrounding&#150; 233 &#150; objects, were not coming in 
search of pearls or gems, but the more valuable treasure contained in the 
sacred Scriptures, deemed by them &#147;more precious than gold, yea, than much 
fine gold.&#148; One evening, about sunset, a canoe from Tahiti with five men 
arrived on this errand They landed on the beach, lowered their sail, and, 
drawing their canoes on the sand, hastened to my native dwelling. I met them at 
the door, and asked them their errand. Luka, or<i>Te Parau na Luka</i>, 
&#147;Luke, or, The Word of Luke,&#148; was the simultaneous reply, accompanied 
with the exhibition of the bamboo-canes filled with cocoa-nut oil, which they 
held up in their hands, and had brought as payment for the copies required. I 
told them I had none ready that night, but that if they would come on the 
morrow, I would give them as many as they needed; recommending them, in the 
mean time, to go and lodge with some friend in the village. Twilight in the 
tropics is always short&#151;it soon grew dark; I wished them good night, and 
afterwards retired to rest, supposing they had gone to sleep at the house of 
some friend; but, on looking out of my window about daybreak, I saw these five 
men lying along on the ground on the outside of my house, their only bed being 
some platted cocoa-nut leaves, and their only covering the large native cloth 
they usually wear over their shoulders. I hastened out, and asked them, if they 
had been there all night: they said they had; I then inquired why they did not, 
as I had directed them, go and lodge at some house, and come again. Their 
answer surprised and delighted me: they said, &#147;We were afraid that, had we 
gone away, some one might have come before us this morning, and have taken what
&#150; 234 &#150; books you had to spare, and then we should have been obliged 
to return without any; therefore, after you left us last night, we determined 
not to go away till we had procured the books.&#148; I called them into the 
printing-office, and, as soon as I could put the sheets together, gave them 
each a copy: they then requested two copies more, one for a mother, the other 
for a sister; for which they had brought payment. I gave these also. Each 
wrapped his book up in a piece of white native cloth, put it in his bosom, 
wished me good morning, and without, I believe, eating or drinking, or calling 
on any person in the settlement, hastened to the beach, launched their canoe, 
hoisted their matting sail, and steered rejoicing to their native island. This 
is only one instance among many that occurred at the time, both at Afareaitu 
and Papetoai, exhibiting the ardent desire of the people in general to possess 
the Scriptures as soon as they could be prepared for them. They frequently 
expressed their apprehensions lest the number of the books should not be 
sufficient for those who were waiting; and have more than once told us, that 
the fear of being disappointed has often deprived them of sleep.<br>
<br>
 Many 
were doubtless influenced by motives of curiosity, others by a desire to 
possess an article of property now so highly esteemed by all parties, but many 
were certainly influenced by a desire to become more fully acquainted with the 
revelation God had made to man, and to read for themselves, in their own 
language, those truths that were able to make them &#147;wise unto 
salvation.&#148; By some, after the first emotion of curiosity had subsided, 
the books were neglected; but by most they were carefully and regularly read, 
becoming&#150; 235 &#150; at once the constant companion of their possessors, 
and the source of their highest enjoyment.<br>
<br>
 When the Gospel of Luke 
was finished, an edition of Hymns in the native language was printed, partly 
original and partly translations from our most approved English compositions; 
and although the book was but small, it was acceptable to the people, who are 
exceedingly fond of metrical compositions, their history and traditions having 
been preserved in a metrical kind of ballad. This circumstance rendered the 
Hymn-book which was completed at Huahine, quite a favourite, and afforded the 
means, not only of assisting them in the matter of their praises to Almighty 
God, but enabled us to convey the most important truths of revelation in the 
manner most attractive and familiar to the native mind.<br>
<br>
 While engaged 
in these labours, the principal object besides, that occupied our attention, 
was the study of the language. Several hours every day were devoted to its 
acquisition, and twice a week we met, when we were assisted by the instructions 
of Mr. Davies, who favoured us with the use of his manuscript vocabulary, and 
the outlines of a grammar, which he had prepared several years before. In 
addition to these means, I found the composing, or setting, of the types for 
the Tahitian books, the best method of acquiring all that was printed in the 
language. Every letter in every word passing repeatedly, not only under my eye, 
but through my hand, I acquired almost mechanically the orthography. The number 
of natives by whom we were always surrounded, afforded the best opportunities 
for learning the meaning of those words which we did not understand. The 
structure of many sentences was also&#150; 236 &#150; acquired by the same 
means; and, in much less than twelve months, I could converse familiarly on any 
common subject. My acquisition of the language was thus facilitated by 
attention to printing in the native tongue.<br>
<br>
 The use of the press in 
the different islands, we naturally regard as one of the most powerful human 
agencies that can be employed in forming the mental and moral character of the 
inhabitants, imparting to their pursuits a salutary direction, and promoting 
knowledge, virtue, and happiness. It is not easy to estimate correctly the 
advantages already derived from this important engine of improvement. The 
sacred Scriptures, and the codes of laws, are the only standard works of 
importance yet printed. The whole of the New, and detached portions of the Old 
Testament, have been finished, and the remaining parts are in progress.<br>
<br>
 In the native language, they also possess Old and New Testament 
histories&#151;several large editions of spelling-books, reading lessons, and 
different catechisms&#151;a short system of arithmetic&#151;the codes of laws 
for the different islands&#151;regulations for barter, and their intercourse 
with shipping. Numerous addresses on the subject of Christian 
practice&#151;several editions of the native hymn-book&#151;the reports of 
their different Societies &#151;and, lastly, they have commenced a periodical 
publication called the Repository. I have received the first number, and most 
earnestly hope they will be able to carry it on. Every work yet printed has 
been prepared by the Missionaries, with the assistance of the most intelligent 
among the people. But we look forward, with pleasing anticipation, to the time 
when the natives themselves&#150; 237 &#150; shall become writers. In the 
investigation and illustration of many things connected with the peculiar 
genius and character of their own countrymen, they will have advantages which 
no individual, who is a foreigner, can ever possess; and we may hope that the 
time is not far distant, when they will not only have standard works by native 
authors, but that their periodical literature will circulate widely, and spread 
knowledge and piety among all classes of the people.</p>

<br>
 About a month after our departure from Papetoai, 
Mr. Orsmond, who had sailed from England about July, 1816, arrived at Eimeo, 
and, after residing some time with the Missionaries at Papetoai, he removed to 
Afareaitu, pursued harmoniously with us the study of the language, assisted in 
preparing books for the people, and in other duties of the station, and 
subsequently accompanied us to the Leeward Islands. On the 17th of November, in 
the same year, Messrs. Bourne, Darling, Platt, and Williams, with their wives, 
who had sailed from England 17th of November, 1816, reached the islands. Mr. 
and Mrs. Threlkeld, who had sailed with us from England, but had been obliged 
by domestic affliction to remain at Rio Janeiro, and Mr. and Mrs. Barff, who 
had originally left England with Mr. Orsmond, joined us by the same conveyance. 
This event was truly cheering to their predecessors, as it conveyed the 
strongest evidence&#150; 239 &#150; of the desire, on the part of the Society 
at home, to relieve them from every distressing anxiety as to their successors, 
and to afford every aid in the prosecution of their important and extending 
work. To us it was a matter of gratitude and satisfaction. With some who had 
now arrived, we had parted nearly two years before in our native land; others 
we had left among strangers on a foreign shore; but we were now, in the 
providence of God, brought together under circumstances peculiarly encouraging; 
and not only permitted to enjoy each others' society, but to combine our 
energies for the advancement of that cause to which our lives were devoted.<br>

<br> The arrival of so large a reinforcement enabled the Missionaries to make 
arrangements for re-occupying their original station in Tahiti, and 
establishing a Mission in the Society, or, as they are usually termed, when 
spoken of in connexion with Tahiti and Eimeo, the Leeward Islands. It was, 
however, thought desirable that no division of their numbers should take place 
until the vessel, the building of which had been commenced soon after the 
return from Port Jackson, should be finished, and the works prepared for the 
press were printed.<br>
<br>
 The vessel, in the building of which the 
Missionaries were engaged when we arrived, had been undertaken jointly by them 
and the king, at the recommendation of the Governor of New South Wales, and of 
the Rev. S. Marsden. The king proposed to find materials, and the Missionaries 
labour. By this means it was hoped they might be enabled to instil into the 
minds of the natives a spirit of enterprise, and induce them to build ships for 
themselves. It was intended to employ the vessel in the pearl-fishery, among 
the Paumotu Islands&#150; 240 &#150; to the eastward; to work her with native 
seamen, to take the pearls, and mother-of-pearl shell, to Port Jackson; 
bringing from that settlement tools, cutlery, and manufactured goods for the 
natives, and supplies for the Mission; thus providing a means of stimulating 
the people to habits of industry, and defraying to a certain degree the 
expenses of the Mission. Such were the views with which the vessel was 
commenced; but circumstances had arisen since that time, which left but little 
hope that these ends would ever be answered. The work was, however, already so 
far advanced, that all parties were unwilling to abandon it.<br>
<br>
 The 
vessel was about seventy tons burden, and the hull nearly completed. The 
Missionaries who had arrived undertook to finish what their predecessors had 
commenced; and although it was an undertaking of great labour, it was ready to 
be launched in a few weeks after they had landed.<br>
<br>
 The 7th of 
December, 1817, being the day fixed for the launch, crowds of the inhabitants 
assembled to witness the spectacle: when the preparations were completed, the 
wedges were removed; but as the vessel did not move, strong ropes were passed 
round her stern, and a number of the islanders on each side began pulling her 
towards the water. Pomare was present, and exerted all his influence to 
stimulate the natives employed in launching the ship. One of the king's 
orators, a short, plump, round-faced man, about fifty years of age, was perched 
upon a projecting rock by the sea-side, vociferating one of their ude, or 
songs, on the launching of their own large canoes, suiting the action to the 
word, and using at times the most violent gesticulations, as if he imagined his 
own muscular powers alone were&#150; 241 &#150; to move the vessel. They have a 
number of these kinds of songs, some of considerable length, which I have at 
different times written down. They were designed to stimulate the men who were 
drawing the canoes into the water.<br>
<br>
 The natives employed in this work 
generally laid down on the beach short logs of the cylindrical trunk of the 
cocoa-nut tree, and drew the canoes over these natural rollers into the sea. 
Some of these songs were very short, as<i>Iriti i mua, iriti i muri, e to, e to 
tau vaa ie</i>: Lift up the stem, lift up the stern, and pull, and pull, my 
strong canoe. The song employed on the present occasion appeared rather a long 
one: I tried to comprehend its import, but, notwithstanding all the 
vociferation of the orator, it was recited with such rapidity, and there was so 
much din and clamour among the people, who on such occasions only put forth 
their strength in proportion to the noise which they make, that I could only 
now and then distinguish the word pahi, a large canoe or ship. Had I been able 
to hear more distinctly, it is probable that at that time I should not have 
understood the bard, as many words not in common use are found in their songs.
<br> <br>
 At length the vessel moved towards the sea, amid the shouts of the 
assembled multitudes. Before, however, she fairly floated, an accident 
occurred, which threw a damp over the spirits of all present. As she glided 
smoothly along towards the water, Pomare, who had stationed himself by the 
sea-side for the purpose, gave the vessel her name, by throwing a bottle of 
wine at her, and exclaiming,<i>Ia ora na oe e Haweis</i>, Prosperity to you, O 
Haweis. It having been agreed to designate the first vessel of any size built 
in the islands&#150; 242 &#150; The Haweis, in honour of the late Dr. Haweis 
who was the steady friend of the South Sea Mission, and in some respects may be 
said to have been its founder.<br>
<br>
 The circumstance of the king's 
throwing the wine at the ship, the breaking of the bottle, the red wine 
spreading abroad, and the pieces of glass flying in every direction, startled 
the natives who were pulling the ropes on that side of the vessel. They 
immediately left hold of the ropes, and stood gazing in astonishment 
alternately at the king, and the place against which the bottle had been 
thrown. Those on the opposite side continued pulling with all their might, and 
soon drew the vessel on one side till she fell. One simultaneous cry, Aue te 
pahi e, Alas, the ship ! or Oh, the ship ! resounded in every direction, and 
the king seemed ot think she would never be launched. With great effort she was 
replaced, during the same afternoon, in an upright position, and subsequently 
launched upon the bosom of the Pacific, amid the exulting shouts of the 
multitudes who thronged the shores.<br>
<br>
 The Haweis was afterwards rigged, 
and employed in conveying the Missionary families to their respective stations; 
after which she made one or two very profitless voyages to New South Wales. On 
account of the heavy expenses attending every voyage, although it was of great 
importance to maintain a regular intercourse between the respective stations, 
and between the islands and the colony, it was found necessary to dispose or 
the ship, which had been built with so much cost and labour; she was sold in 
New South Wales, and is now employed in trading between Port Jackson and Van 
Diemen's Land.</p> 
<p>&#150; 243 &#150;</p> 
<p>Although finishing the vessel, and printing, required the greater number of 
the Missionaries to continue in Eimeo, these duties did not detain the whole, 
but left several at liberty to extend, in some degree, their efforts. Matavai, 
the original Missionary station, was the first that was re-occupied. Mr. 
Wilson, one of the Missionaries who first landed from the Royal Admiral in 
1801, resumed his labours here in the early part of 1818, within a quarter of a 
mile of the spot from which he had been obliged to fly when the Mission was 
broken up in the close of the year 1809, and not far from the place where Mr. 
Lewis was murdered.<br>
<br>
 Mr. Bicknell, accompanied by Mr. Tessier, formed 
a station under the auspices of Tati, in the populous district of Papara. A new 
station was also commenced by Mr. Crook and Mr. Bourne at Papaoa, in the 
district of Faa; and when the Haweis was finished, Mr. Darling joined Mr. 
Wilson at Matavai. At the urgent request of Utami, the chief of the populous 
district of Atehuru, he subsequently commenced a Mission among his people at 
Bunaau&iuml;a, or Burder's Point, whither Mr. Bourne also repaired.<br>
<br>
 
The two stations at Eimeo being on opposite sides of the island, occasioned us 
frequent journeys from Afareaitu to Papetoai. These excursions, although they 
gave us an opportunity of examining more extensively the aspect of the country 
and the state of its inhabitants, often proved fatiguing. Sometimes we walked 
along the beach to Papeare, several miles to the north of our 
abode&#151;ascended a low ridge of mountains, extending nearly to the 
sea&#151;crossed the elevated eastern range&#151;and continuing our way through 
the defiles and ravines of the interior mountains,&#150; 244 &#150; descended 
on the opposite side of the island, and approached the shore near the inland 
boundary of Opunohu bay. At other times, we travelled round in the 
neighbourhood of the shore, alternately walking on the beach, or, proceeding in 
a light canoe, paddled along the shallow water near the shore. Occasionally we 
passed through the inland village of Tamae; and although, whenever we took this 
route, we had to walk three-quarters of a mile along the margin of the lake, up 
to our knees in water, yet we have always been amply repaid, by beholding the 
neatness of the gardens, and the sequestered peace of the village, by 
experiencing the generous hospitality, and receiving unequivocal proofs of the 
simple piety, of its inhabitants. Once or twice, when approaching Tamae about 
sunrise, we have met the natives returning from the bushes, whither by the 
break of day, they had retired for mediation and secret prayer. Their 
countenance beamed with peace and delight; and,<i>Ia ora oe ia Iesu, Ia ora oe 
i te Atua</i> &#151;Peace to you from Jesus, Blessing on you from God&#151;was 
the general strain of their salutation.<br>
<br>
 More than once we had to take 
our little boy, even before he was three months old, from Afareaitu, where he 
was born, to Papetoai, for medical advice.<br>
<br>
 These journeys were 
exceedingly wearisome: returning from one of them, night overtook us many miles 
before we reached our home; we travelled part of the way in a single canoe, but 
for several miles, where there was no passage between the reef and the shore, 
and the fragile bark was exposed without shelter to the long heavy billows of 
the Pacific, we proceeded along the beach, while the natives rowed the canoe 
upon the open&#150; 245 &#150; sea. Two native female attendants alternately 
carried the child, while Mrs. Ellis and I walked on the shore, occasionally 
climbing over the rocks, or sinking up to our ankles in fragments of coral and 
sand. Wearied with our walk, we were obliged to rest before we reached the 
place where we expected to embark again. Mrs. Ellis, unable to walk any 
further, sat down upon a rock of coral, and gave our infant the breast, while I 
hailed the natives, and directed them to bring the canoe over the reef, and 
take us on board. Happily for us, the evening was fair, the moon shone 
brightly, and her mild beams, silvering the foliage of the shrubs that grew 
near the shore, and playing on the rippled and undulating wave of the ocean, 
added a charm to the singularity of the prospect, and enlivened the loneliness 
of our situation. The scene was unusually impressive. I remember distinctly my 
feelings as I stood, wearied with my walk, leaning on a light staff by the side 
of the rock on which Mrs. Ellis with our infant was sitting, and behind which 
our female attendants stood. On one side the mountains of the interior, having 
their outline edged, as it were with silver, from the rays of the moon, rose in 
lofty magnificence, while the indistinct form, rich and diversified verdure, of 
the shrubs and trees, increased the effect of the scene. On the other hand was 
the illimitable sea, rolling in solemn majesty its swelling waves over the 
rocks which defended the spot on which we stood. The most profound silence 
prevailed, and we might have fancied that we were the only beings in existence, 
for no sound was heard, excepting the gentle rustling of the leaves of the 
cocoa-nut tree, as the light breeze from the mountain swept through&#150; 246 
&#150; them, or the hollow roar of the surf, and the rolling of the foaming 
wave as it broke over the distant reef, and the splashing of the paddle of our 
canoe as it approached the shore. It was impossible, at such a season, to 
behold this scene, exhibiting impressively the grandeur of creation, and the 
insignificance of man, without experiencing emotions of adoring wonder and 
elevated devotion, and exclaiming with the psalmist, &#147;When I consider thy 
heavens, the work of thy fingers, the moon and the stars which thou hast 
ordained; what is man, that thou art mindful of him, and the son of man, that 
thou visitest him?&#148;<br>
<br>
 The canoe at length reached the shore; we 
seated ourselves in its stern, and, advancing pleasantly along for seven or 
eight miles, reached our habitation about midnight.<br>
<br>
 As soon as the 
printing was finished, we prepared to remove to the island of Huahine, the most 
windward of the group properly called the Society Islands.<br>
<br>
 The king, 
and many of the chiefs of Tahiti and Eimeo, appeared to lament the removal of 
the press; but as Mr. Bourne, who was acquainted with the art of printing, had 
a small press and types, and others had been requested from England, it was the 
less to be regretted. The principal object attempted in the establishment of a 
station at Afareaitu having been accomplished, we left our houses and gardens, 
and took a most affectionate leave of our friends, who evinced great regret at 
our departure.<br>
<br>
 The season we had spent with them had been to us a 
period of no ordinary activity and excitement, and it would probably be 
regarded by them as an era in their history. We trust some&#150; 247 &#150; 
advantage was derived from the instructions they had received; and we have 
every reason to remember, with pleasure, the hospitality and kindness we 
experienced. Once a week, the people of Maatea, a neighbouring district, 
brought our family a present of bread-fruit, and other articles of food; the 
inhabitants of Afareaitu, and the district of Teavaro, took a similar one to 
our companions. We reposed the most entire confidence in the people, and had no 
reason to regret even the exposure of our property. We were robbed by an 
English servant, whom we had taken from Port Jackson, of linen and clothing; 
but, although we had no lock, and for a long time no bolt on our door, (which, 
when fastened, a native could at any time have opened, by putting his hand 
through the sticks and pushing back the bolt, and though sometimes the door was 
left open all night,)&#151;yet we do not know that one single article was 
stolen from us by the natives, during the eighteen months we resided among them.
<br> <br>
 I have visited the district only once since; and although welcomed 
with every expression of gladness by the people, I experienced a sensation of 
melancholy interest, in walking over the garden, the fences of which had been 
taken down, and a few flourishing shrubs only remained, to mark its situation. 
Most of the valuable plants had been removed by the people to their own 
gardens, as the spot selected by me was not one which they would have 
preferred. A few cocoa-nuts which I had planted near the printing-office 
appeared to thrive, as they were protected by a light fence round each of the 
trees.<br>
<br>
 When we were prepared to remove, the Haweis came round, took 
our goods, and the articles belonging&#150; 248 &#150; to the printing-office, 
&amp;c., on board, and proceeded to Papetoai, where we shipped our cattle. On 
the eighteenth of June, 1818, Mr Davies, Mr. and Mrs. Williams, Mr. and Mrs 
Orsmond, Mrs. Ellis, and myself, accompanied by a number of the principal 
chiefs, sailed from Eimeo to the Leeward Islands. We arrived at Huahine late on 
the evening of the following day, and some of our party went on shore, but it 
was not till the morning of the 20th that we reached the anchorage in Fare 
harbour.<br>
<br>
 Here I looked abroad with new and mingled emotions on the 
scene in which I was to commence my labours, and probably to spend the 
remainder of my life. The clear sky was reflected in the unruffled waters of 
the bay, which was bordered with a fine beach strewn with shells. The luxuriant 
convolvulus, presenting its broad and shining leaves in striking contrast with 
the white coral and sand, spread its vines across the beach, even to the margin 
of the water, over which the slender shrub or the flowering tree often extended 
their verdant branches, while the groves of stately breadfruit, and the clumps 
of<i>umbrageous callophyllum</i>, or <i>tamanu</i> trees, and the tall and 
graceful waving cocoa-nuts, shaded the different parts of the shore.<br>
<br>
 
The district of Fa-re, bordering the harbour of the same name, is about a mile 
and a half, or two miles, in length, and reaches from the shore to the centre 
of the island. It is bounded on the south by a range of mountains separating it 
from the district of Haapape, and on the north by the small district of Buaoa, 
whence a long, bleak point of land, called the Faaao, extending a considerable 
distance into the sea, and covered with tall cocoanut&#150; 249 &#150; trees, 
adds much to the beauty of the shore, and the security of the harbour. A ridge 
of inferior hills divides the district in the centre, and greatly increases the 
picturesque appearance of its scenery. A small river rises on the northern side 
of this ridge, and, flowing along the boundary between the two districts, meets 
the sea exactly opposite the northern entrance. Another stream, more broad and 
rapid, rises at the head of the principal valley, and flows in a circuitous 
course to the southern part of the bay. The district is well watered and 
wooded. The lower hills, at the time of our arrival, were clothed with verdure, 
and the mountains in the centre of the island, whose summits appeared to 
penetrate the clouds, were often entirely covered with trees. All was rich and 
luxuriant in vegetation, but it was the richness and the luxuriance of a 
wilderness; scarcely a trace of human culture could be seen, yet I could but 
think the scene</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>&#147;How fair, <br>
 Were it but from sin refined: <br>
 Man how free, how 
happy here,<br>
 Were he pure as God is kind.&#148;</p> </blockquote> 
<p>A few native houses were visible: there were not probably more than ten or 
twelve in the district, and the inhabitants might be occasionally seen guiding 
the light canoe across the bay, or leisurely walking beneath the shade of the 
spreading trees. They were the rude untutored tenants of the place; their 
appearance and their actions were in perfect keeping with the scenes of 
wildness by which they were surrounded. The only clothing most of them wore was 
a girdle of cloth bound loosely round the waist, and a shade of cocoa-nut 
leaves over their foreheads. Notwithstanding this, it was&#150; 250 &#150; 
impossible to behold without emotion either the scenery or inhabitants.<br>
<br>
 The Plate which forms the frontispiece to the third volume of this work, 
exhibits an accurate representation of the outline and character of the scenery 
in the north-eastern parts of the district and harbour, though taken at a 
period subsequent to our arrival, when the landscape had been improved by 
partially clearing the ground near the shore, and erecting a number of houses.
<br> <br>
 In the forenoon of the day after we came to anchor, accompanied by 
Matapuupuu, we walked through the district, in search of a house for Mr. 
Orsmond and myself, and at length selected one on the southern side of the bay, 
belonging to Taaroarii, the young chief of the island, while Mr. and Mrs. 
Williams were accommodated with another belonging to Maau, a raatira, who 
resided near the anchorage. Towards noon, our goods were most of them landed, 
and taken into our new habitation. It was a large oval building, standing 
within ten or twelve yards of the sea, without either partitions or even sides, 
consisting simply of a large roof, supported by three pillars along the centre, 
and a number round the sides. The floor was composed of stones, sand, and clay. 
Mr. and Mrs. Orsmond occupied one end, and we took up our abode in the other.
<br> <br>
 When our goods, &amp;c. were all brought under its cover, and the 
boats had returned to the ship, we sat down to rest, and could not avoid gazing 
on the scene around us, before we began to adjust our luggage. Large fragments 
of rock were scattered at the base of the mountains that rose on one side of 
our dwelling, the sea rolled within a few yards on the other, and in each 
direction along the shore&#150; 251 &#150; there was one wild and uncultivated 
wilderness. A pair of cattle, that we had brought from New South Wales, with a 
young calf, all of which had been landed from the ship during the morning, were 
tied to an adjacent bread-fruit tree; two or three milch goats from Eimeo, 
fastened together by bands of hibiscus bark tied round their horns, had already 
taken their station on the craggy projections at the foot of the mountain, and 
were cropping the herbage that grew in the fissures of the rocks. One of our 
little ones was smiling in the lap of its native nurse, while the other was 
playing on the dried grass lying by the side of the boxes on which we were 
sitting, and the natives, under the full influence of highly excited curiosity, 
thronged around us in such numbers as to impede the circulation of the air.<br>

<br> Our first effort was to prepare some refreshment. The chiefs had sent us a 
present of bread-fruit and fish. A native youth, fourteen or fifteen years of 
age, leaving the crowd, came forward, and asked if he should cook us some 
bread-fruit. We accepted his offer; he became a faithful servant, and continued 
with us till we removed from the islands. He fixed two large stones in the 
ground for a fire-place, and, bringing a bundle of dry sticks from the adjacent 
bushes, lighted a fire between the stones, upon which he placed the tea-kettle. 
While he was employed in dressing our bread-fruit, &amp;c. we removed some of 
the boxes, piled up our luggage as compactly as we could, and, when the food 
was prepared, sat down to a pleasant repast of fried fish, bread-fruit, and 
plantains, cocoa-nut milk, and tea. As a beverage, we always preferred the 
latter, although the former is exceedingly pleasant.</p> 
<p>&#150; 252 &#150; The large island of Raiatea lies immediately to the west 
of Fare harbour, and, by the time we had finished our meal, the sun was partly 
hid behind the high and broken summits of its mountains. This admonished us to 
prepare our sleeping-place, as the twilight is short, and we were not sure of 
procuring lights for the evening. The natives cut down four stout sticks from 
the neighbouring trees; these we fixed in the earthen floor, and fastening 
sheets and native cloth from one to the other, enclosed our bed-room; a couple 
of chests were carried into it, upon which we spread our bed, making up one for 
the children by the side of our own, on some packages that lay on the floor. We 
procured cocoa-nut oil, and when it grew dark, breaking a cocoa-nut in half, 
took one end, and winding a little cotton-wool round the thin stalk of the 
leaflet of the tree, fixed it erect in the kernel of the nut. This we filled 
with the oil, and thus our lamp and oil were entirely the production of the 
cocoa-nut tree; the small piece of cotton-wick gathered from the garden in 
Eimeo, being the only article it had not supplied. These were the only kind of 
lamps we had for some years, and, though rude in appearance, they gave a good 
light, when kept steady, and sheltered from the wind. Shortly, however, after 
sunset this evening, the land-breeze came down from the mountains. As we had no 
shelter for our lamp, we found it difficult to keep it burning, and at an early 
hour retired to rest, tying our screen down with strips of bark, to prevent its 
being blown aside by the wind. Notwithstanding the novelty of our situation, 
the exposure to the air from the mountains, the roaring of the heavy surf on 
the reefs, the inroads of dogs, pigs, and natives, with no other shelter than a 
pile&#150; 253 &#150; of boxes; we passed a comfortable night, and rose 
refreshed in the morning, thankful for the kind protection we had experienced, 
gratified also to find that no article of our property had been stolen, though 
all was unavoidably exposed.<br>
<br>
 The island of Huahine had, in common 
with the others forming the leeward group, been visited by Mr. Nott, who had 
travelled round it, preaching to the inhabitants of the principal villages. The 
Missionaries who had been expelled from Tahiti in 1808, had remained here some 
months prior to their final departure for Port Jackson; but at these periods 
only a temporary impression had been made upon the minds of the people, which 
had in a great degree, if not altogether, subsided. After the abolition of 
idolatry in Tahiti and Eimeo, and the subsequent adoption of Christianity by 
their inhabitants, Mahine, the king of Huahine, had sent down Vahaivi, one of 
his principal men, with directions to the chiefs to burn the idols, demolish 
the temples, and discontinue the ceremonies and worship connected therewith. 
This commission was executed, and not only were their objects of worship 
destroyed, their temples thrown down, the houses of their idols consumed, and 
idol-worship no longer practised; but the rude stills employed in preparing 
ardent spirits from the sugarcane, and other indigenous productions, were 
either broken, or hid under ground. Intoxication, infant murder, and some of 
the more degrading vices, fostered under the sanction of their superstition, 
were also discontinued.<br>
<br>
 This change, although approved and effected 
by the principal chiefs on the islands, in conjunction with the messenger of 
the king, was nevertheless opposed. Several chiefs, of inferior influence,
&#150; 254 &#150; collecting their dependents, encamped on the borders of the 
lake near Maeva, and threatened to avenge the insult to the gods, by attacking 
the chiefs who had sanctioned their destruction. Both parties, however, after 
assuming a hostile attitude for some time, adjusted their differences, and 
returned in peace to their respective districts, mutually agreeing to embrace 
Christianity, and wait the arrival of the Missionaries, whose residence among 
them they had been led to expect. In this state we found them when we landed; 
they had, with the exception of one or two individuals, forsaken idolatry, and, 
in profession at least, had become Christians; probably without understanding 
the nature of Christianity, or feeling in any great degree its moral restraints 
or its sacred influence. A few, including two or three who had been to Eimeo, 
had acquired the elements of reading, or had learned to repeat the lessons in 
the spelling book, more from memory than acquaintance with spelling and 
reading; the rest remained nearly in the same state in which they were when 
visited in 1808 and 1809, excepting that their superstitious ceremonies were 
discontinued, and they had a building for the worship of the true God.<br>
<br>

 For a number of Sabbaths after our arrival, but few of the inhabitants 
assembled for public worship, and the schools were very thinly attended. Those 
who came were so little acquainted with the gospel, that in the lessons given 
in the school, and the addresses delivered to assemblies met for worship, it 
was found necessary to begin with the first principles of instruction, and of 
Christianity. Numbers excused themselves from attending, on account of the 
wearisomeness of learning their&#150; 255 &#150; letters, when there was every 
reason to believe that unwillingness to conform to the precepts inculcated, was 
the true cause of disinclination. They neglected public worship, because they 
said they did not know how to read; this being considered a sufficient apology 
for the non-observance of the Sabbath, or the social duties of religion. Such 
neglect was also frequently used as a cover for wickedness. When spoken to on 
the impropriety of their conduct, they would sometimes answer, &#147;We are not 
scholars,&#148; or, &#147;We are not praying people;&#148; these being the 
terms employed to designate those who made a profession of religion. Many were 
induced to keep back from the schools, and the place of public worship, from a 
desire to remain free from those restraints on their vicious practices, which 
such profession of Christianity was considered to impose.<br>
<br>
 Under these 
circumstances we acted upon the principles by which our predecessors had 
invariably regulated their endeavours to teach the inhabitants of Tahiti and 
Eimeo; and respecting which, after careful observation, I believe we are 
unanimous in our conviction that they are the true principles upon which any 
attempts to instruct a rude untutored people can be prosecuted with a prospect 
of the greatest ultimate success. We made no presents to those who were our 
scholars, more than to others from whom we had experienced an equal degree of 
hospitality; we offered no reward to any one for learning, and held out no 
prospect of personal or temporal advantage to our pupils and hearers; and 
studiously avoided presenting any other inducements to learn, than the 
advantages that would be secured to our scholars themselves, by the possession 
of that knowledge, which&#150; 256 &#150; we were not only willing but desirous 
to impart. At the same time we were most anxious, distinctly and powerfully to 
impress on their minds the desirableness and necessity of their possessing 
correct ideas of the true God&#151;the means of seeking his favour through 
Jesus Christ the only Saviour&#151;the happiness that would result there from 
in the present life, and in that state of existence after death, to which this 
was but preparative &#151;together with the increase of knowledge and enjoyment 
that would attend their being able to read the printed books,&#151;preserve 
whatever they heard that was valuable, by making it fast upon the 
paper,&#151;and corresponding by letter with their friends at a distance, as 
familiarly and distinctly as if they were present. By representations such as 
these, we endeavoured to excite in their minds a desire to hear the Scriptures 
read, and the gospel preached, in the chapels, and to attend our instructions 
in the schools.<br>
<br>
 Had our means been ample, and had we, on landing, or 
when inviting the attention of the chiefs and people to the objects of our 
proposed residence among them, liberally distributed presents of cloth, 
ironmongery, &amp;c. or even engaged in part to support the children that would 
receive our lessons, the chapel would undoubtedly have been well attended, and 
the scholars proportionably multiplied; but it would have been only from the 
desire to receive a constant supply of presents; a motive highly prejudicial to 
the individuals by whom it would have been indulged, destructive of the 
comfort, and disastrous to the future labours of the Missionary among them. So 
long as our distributions had been frequent and increasingly valuable, the 
expressions of attachment would&#150; 257 &#150; have been ardent, and the 
attendance regular; but when these had failed, their zeal, &amp;c. would have 
declined, and the chapel and the school would have been deserted. In addition 
to this, whenever a fresh supply of articles, for our own maintenance or use, 
might have arrived, if we had not been equally liberal in the distribution of 
our presents, we should have been unhesitatingly charged with keeping for 
ourselves that which was designed for them, and thus have been involved in 
unpleasant altercation.<br>
<br>
 The plans of procedure, in the commencement 
of a new Mission, must necessarily be regulated in a great degree by the 
circumstances of the people among whom it may be established; and the extreme 
poverty, or fugitive habits, of the parents, may render it desirable for the 
teachers either wholly or in part to maintain the scholars, in order to secure 
attendance. These instances are, I believe, very rare, and absolute necessity 
alone can warrant recourse to such a plan. Instruction itself will be 
undervalued; it can never be attempted but on a very limited scale, and will be 
always liable to vexatious interruptions. A system of maintenance should only 
be adopted in regard to such pupils as it is hoped are under religious 
impressions, or are training with a view to their becoming monitors or 
schoolmasters themselves. In those parts of the world where the scholars could 
not be supported while at the schools, it would be better for them to devote a 
portion of their time to such employment as would enable them to procure the 
means of subsistence themselves, than that they should receive their 
maintenance from the Mission.<br>
<br>
 These remarks apply principally to the 
commencement&#150; 258 &#150; of a Mission among an unenlightened people, where 
a school will be an essential part of such establishment; at subsequent 
periods, rewards to those who have excelled, consisting of books, penknives, 
inkstands, slates, or other articles connected with the pursuits of the school, 
may be given with a good effect, tending rather to stimulate to diligent 
enterprise, than to cherish a spirit of dependent indolence, or to excite 
expectations that never can be gratified.<br>
<br>
 In reference to presents 
made by Missionaries to chiefs, on their first settlement among an 
unenlightened people, I am disposed to think they are always injurious, when 
given with a view of gaining influence, or inducing their recipients to attend 
to religious instruction. Self-interest, or a desire for property, is the 
principle upon which the intercourse uncivilized persons have with foreigners 
visiting their country for purposes of commerce, &amp;c. is regulated; the 
estimation in which such individuals are usually held, and the influence they 
exercise, is proportioned to the extent of their property, or the portions of 
it which the natives receive. Not a few instances have occurred among the 
islands of the Pacific, in which individuals, who, while their presents were 
unsparingly lavished upon the people, were regarded as kings and chiefs among 
them, but who, when they have experienced a reverse in their circumstances, 
have been treated with marked and contemptuous neglect. An equal degree of this 
kind of influence, the means of the Missionary will never enable him to gain 
among the people, nor ought he for a moment to desire it. Discouraging indeed 
will be his prospects, if the estimation in which he is held by those among 
whom he labours be only that&#150; 259 &#150; which arises from their 
expectation of the presents he may make them. His influence must be of a higher 
order, if he desires to succeed.<br>
<br>
 The effect of a present on the mind 
of a rude or partially civilized chieftain is instantaneous, but it requires 
constant repetition, or increase, to prevent its decline. The influence which a 
Missionary will aim to possess is more difficult to attain; but when once 
possessed, is of exceedingly greater value. It is the result of a conviction in 
the minds of the people, that his ultimate aim is their welfare; that he comes 
among them to promote, not his own, but their interest; and that his efforts 
tend to increase their knowledge and their enjoyments, and are adapted to put 
them in possession of the means of multiplying their comforts in this life, and 
leading them to future blessedness.<br>
<br>
 To produce and sustain this 
conviction in the minds of the people around him, should be among the first and 
the constant endeavours of a Missionary. Until he has effected this, he can 
expect but little success; and when once, under the blessing of God, it is 
attained, one of the greatest difficulties in his way will be removed. This 
influence is not to be obtained by presents; these, the most rude and untutored 
heathen know, are seldom given unless an equivalent is expected in return; but 
it is to be gained by a full, plain, and explicit statement of his objects in 
the commencement of his work, and a uniform reference, in all his subsequent 
conduct, to the advancement of these objects. Uncivilized communities are often 
most shrewd observers of the conduct of those who enter their society, and pay 
far more regard to the actions and dispositions, than the mere declarations, of 
strangers. Singleness of aim, and purity&#150; 260 &#150; of motive, imbodied, 
before such observers, in undeviating and disinterested efforts, will in 
general be appreciated, although they may not soon yield themselves up to the 
influence of those efforts.<br>
<br>
 One of the most effectual means of 
implanting and preserving this impression is, the exhibition of uniform 
benevolence. The office and the aim of every Missionary require the exercise of 
this disposition in the highest degree; and he who would be successful, should 
by this identify himself, as far as possible, with the objects of his regard. 
Without officiously interfering with their individual or family affairs, he 
should interest himself in their welfare, and strive to share and alleviate 
their distress. Besides the deep commiseration, which their spiritual 
wretchedness will excite, he will often find their temporal afflictions and 
sorrows such as to claim his tenderest sympathy. &#147;Kindness is the key to 
the human heart;&#148; when the spirit is softened or subdued under the 
influence of sufferings, it is often most susceptible of salutary impression; 
and the exercise of Christian sympathy and kindness, in such a season, will 
seldom fail to produce, even among the most barbarous tribes, highly favourable 
results.<br>
<br>
 In mere casual visits, or journeys through the countries of 
uncivilized tribes, presents to their chiefs are necessary, and often 
desirable, even where a Missionary is a permanent resident; but they should 
always be given as a token of friendship and personal respect from the 
Missionary, or of good-will from some friends by whom they may have been sent, 
and not as a means of obtaining influence, or inducing the people to attend to 
instruction.</p>

<br>
 Shortly after our arrival 
in Huahine, a large boat belonging to Mahine, the chief of the island, two 
others belonging to Messrs. Orsmond and Williams, and a fleet of canoes, 
brought down from Eimeo a number of chiefs and people belonging to Huahine, 
Raiatea, &amp;c. They had gone to Tahiti many years before, for the purpose of 
assisting Pomare in the resumption of his authority, had witnessed and 
participated the change that had taken place, and had afterwards prolonged 
their residence, in order to enjoy the advantages of instruction, until a 
Mission should be established in their native islands. Their arrival was 
welcomed with joy, and we were happy to receive their countenance and 
co-operation in the prosecution of our work. An excitement, highly beneficial in
&#150; 262 &#150; its tendency, was awakened in the minds of the people; who, 
influenced by the example and advice of their friends from Eimeo, attended in 
great numbers daily at the schools, and were seen in the chapel, not only on 
the Sabbath, but whenever it was open for public worship. Numerous applications 
were also made for spelling-books, of which, with others of an elementary kind, 
a supply had been printed in Eimeo.<br>
<br>
 When the whole of the 
Missionaries reached Huahine, it was proposed in the first instance to form 
only one station in the Leeward Islands; and that those of us who had but 
recently arrived from England, should unitedly prosecute the study of the 
language, with such assistance as Messrs. Davies and Nott could render us, 
until we should be able to perform divine service among the people, and conduct 
the affairs of a distinct station. The acquisition of the language engaged our 
constant attention; and we not only devoted some hours every day to its study, 
but met together two or three times a week, to receive instruction, and 
facilitate our improvement.<br>
<br>
 We had not been many weeks at Fare before 
Tamatoa, the king of Raiatea, with his brother, and a number of chiefs from 
Raiatea, Tahaa, and Borabora arrived. They were exceedingly anxious that some 
of our number should at once remove to their islands. Mai, the king or chief of 
Borabora, who was alos at Huahine, had before written to the Missionaries, 
reminding them that Jesus Christ and his apostles did not confine themselves to 
one place, but visited different parts, that as many as could might receive 
their instructions. The necessities of the people were so obvious, the 
prospects of usefulness so extensive, and the request&#150; 263 &#150; of the 
chiefs so urgent, that, although unwilling to be deprived of the assistance of 
their seniors, in the acquisition of the language, Mr. Williams and Mr. 
Threlkeld felt it to be their duty to accompany Tamatoa, and the chiefs who 
were with him, to Raiatea. They purposed to attempt their civilization, the 
establishment of schools, and, with the assistance of pious and intelligent 
natives, their instruction in the use of letters, and the first principles of 
religion; while they were cultivating such an acquaintance with the language as 
would enable them more fully to unfold the great objects of their Mission. They 
represented distinctly the disadvantages under which they should commence 
public instruction, from their very partial knowledge of the language; but the 
chiefs always replied, &#147;Never mind that, you possess enough now to teach 
us more than we know, and we will make it our business to teach you our 
language.&#148; The visitors from Raiatea were supported in their application 
by a number of chiefs belonging to the same island; who, after residing some 
years in Eimeo, had now removed to Huahine, and were desirous of returning to 
their own possessions in Raiatea and Tahaa, yet did not wish to go 
unaccompanied by some of those, from whose instruction they had derived 
advantage.<br>
<br>
 It was always a matter of regret with the Missionaries, 
that the expenses of the establishment in the islands should be sustained 
altogether by the parent Society; and in order to diminish this, they had from 
time to time disposed of the fruits of their own industry, to the captains of 
vessels touching at Tahiti; or they had sent small quantities to New South 
Wales, receiving, in return, such articles as they were most in need of.</p> 
<p>&#150; 264 &#150;</p> 
<p>The greater portion of the inhabitants having now embraced Christianity, 
they availed themselves of what appeared to them the most suitable means for 
impressing the minds of the converts with the principle laid down in the 
Scriptures, that it is the duty of those who enjoy the gospel, not only to 
maintain, but also to extend it. It appeared to them that both these ends might 
be answered most appropriately and effectually, by establishing among the 
natives a Missionary Society, auxiliary to the London Society, rather than by 
calling upon them, immediately after their conversion, to support the teachers 
labouring among them. Such a measure might, while they were but partially 
acquainted with the true nature and design of Christianity, have induced some, 
who were perhaps halting between two opinions, to infer that the Missionaries 
were influenced by motives of pecuniary advantage, in their endeavours to 
induce them to receive Christian instruction.<br>
<br>
 The inhabitants of the 
islands knew that many of the supplies which the families from time to time 
received, were sent by their friends in England, and procured by the voluntary 
contributions of those there, who had first sent, and subsequently maintained, 
the Mission; and it was thought that it would be better that their 
contributions towards the support of Christianity, should be combined with 
those of the contributors to the Missionary Society; that the supplies for the 
teachers might still be drawn from this source, while at the same time the 
natives would be contributing towards the support of their own instructors, and 
yet identifying themselves with British Christians in their efforts to 
propagate Christianity throughout the world.</p> 
<p>&#150; 265 &#150; The plan was proposed to the king, and at once approved 
by him; it was also mentioned to several of the leading chiefs, by whom it was 
favourably received. Auna told me that the king one day said to him, 
&#147;Auna, do you think you could collect five bamboo canes of oil in a 
year?&#148; He answered, Yes; and the king said, &#147;Do you think you could 
appropriate so much towards sending the world of God to the heathens?&#148; 
Again he answered in the affirmative; and the king again said, &#147;Do you 
think those that value the gospel would think it a great labour to collect so 
much yearly for this purpose?&#148; Auna answered that he did not think they 
would. &#147;Then,&#148; said the king, &#147;think about it, and perhaps we 
can have a combination, or society, for this purpose.&#148; The king found 
several chiefs favourably disposed; the Missionaries also proposed it to 
others; and, as it met with general approbation, the approaching month of May 
was appointed for the establishment of the association.<br>
<br>
 Mr. Nott came 
over to Afareaitu for the purpose of completing the plan. On the 23d of April, 
in the same year, Messrs. Nott, Davies, Orsmond, and myself, held a meeting 
with the king, at our house; when the principles upon which the society should 
be formed, and the rules by which it was proposed to regulate its proceedings, 
were considered, and, on the following day, finally adjusted.<br>
<br>
 The 
13th of May, 1818, being the anniversary of the parent institution in England, 
was fixed for the establishment and organization of the native society. The 
king and chiefs met at Papetoai, and it was a delightful and interesting day to 
all who were present.</p> 
<p>&#150; 266 &#150; At sunrise we held a prayer-meeting in the English 
language. The natives held one among themselves at the same hour. The forenoon 
was appropriated to worship, in English; at which time a sermon was preached by 
Mr. Henry, one of the senior Missionaries; and in the afternoon the services 
were entirely in the native language.<br>
<br>
 The chiefs and people assembled 
from most of the districts of Eimeo, and a number of strangers from Tahiti, 
residing at Papetoai, were also present. The extension of the Redeemer's 
kingdom had been the topic of discourses in the native congregation on the 
preceding Sabbath, and had in some degree prepared the minds of the people for 
entering more fully into the subject. The public services on this occasion were 
to commence at three o'clock in the afternoon; but long before the appointed 
hour, the chapel was crowded, and a far greater number than had gained 
admission, still remained on the outside.<br>
<br>
 Three or four hundred yards 
distant from the chapel, there was a beautiful and extensive grove. To this 
spot it was proposed to adjourn, and thither the natives immediately repaired, 
seating themselves on the ground under the cocoa-nut trees. At three o'clock we 
walked to the grove, and on entering it beheld one of the most imposing and 
delightful spectacles I think I ever witnessed in the islands. The sky was 
clear, the smooth surface of the ocean rippled with the cool and stirring 
breeze. The grove, stately and rich in all the luxuriance of tropical verdure, 
extended from the beach to the very base of the mountains, whose gradual 
ascent, and rocky projections, led to the interior. The long-winged and 
interwoven leaves of the trees formed a spreading canopy, through which a 
straggling&#150; 267 &#150; sunbeam occasionally found its way, and among whose 
long and graceful leaflets the breeze from the ocean, sweeping softly, gave a 
degree of animation to the whole. The grass that grew underneath appeared like 
a rich carpet, spread by nature for the ceremony; pendulous plants, some 
verdant in foliage, others rich and variegated in blossom, hung from the 
projections of the rocks, while several species of convolvulus and climbing 
plants were twined round the trunks of the trees, ornamenting the whole with 
their large and splendid pink blossoms. Near one of the large cocoa-nut trees, 
whose cylindrical trunk appeared like a natural pillar supporting the roof, 
there was a rustic sort of stand, four or five feet above the ground, on which 
Mr. Nott took his station. Before him, in a large arm-chair provided for the 
occasion, sat Pomare, supported on the right by Tati, chief of Papara, and on 
the left by Upaparu, the king's secretary. A number of chiefs, with the queen 
and principal women of the islands, sat around; while thousands of the people, 
attired in their gay and many-coloured native or European dresses, composed the 
vast assemblage, each one having come, as to a public festival, in his best 
apparel. Pomare was dressed in a fine yellow tiputa, stamped on that part which 
covered his left breast with a rich and elegant scarlet flower, instead of a 
star. Most of the chiefs wore the native costume, and the females were arrayed 
in white native cloth, and yellow cocoa-nut-leaf shades, or bonnets with 
wreaths of sweet-scented flowers round their necks, or garlands of the same in 
their hair. The services commenced with singing, in which many of the natives 
joined. A solemn prayer was offered, after which&#150; 268 &#150; Mr. Nott 
delivered a short, animated, and suitable discourse, from the Eunuch's answer 
to Philip, Acts viii. 30, 31. As soon as this was concluded, Pomare addressed 
the multitude of his subjects around, proposing the formation of a society.<br>

<br> He began by referring them to the ages that were past, and to the system 
of false religion by which they had been so long enslaved, reminding them very 
feelingly of the rigid exactions imposed in the name of their imaginary gods, 
for they were but pieces of wood, or cocoa-nut husk. He then alluded to the 
toil they endured, and the zeal and diligence so often manifested, in the 
service of these idols. To them the first-fruits of the field, the choicest 
fish from the sea, with the most valuable productions of their labour and 
ingenuity, were offered; and to propitiate their favour, avert their 
displeasure, and death, its dreaded consequence, human victims were so often 
slain. While referring to these dark and distressing features of their 
idolatry, the general seriousness of the assembly, and the indications of 
remorse or horror in the recollection of these cruelties, appeared to accompany 
and respond confirmation to his statements. In striking contrast with them, he 
placed the mild and benevolent motives and tendency of the gospel of Jesus 
Christ, and the benefits its introduction had conferred: alluding to the very 
fact of their being assembled for the purpose which had convened them, as a 
powerful illustration of his remarks. He then stated the obligations they were 
under to God for sending them his word, and the partial manifestation of 
gratitude they had yet given. After this, he directed their attention to the 
miserable situation of those whom God had not&#150; 269 &#150; thus visited, 
and proposed that, from a sense of the value of the gospel, and a desire for 
its dissemination, they should form a Tahitian Missionary Society, to aid the 
London Society in sending the gospel to the heathen, especially those in the 
islands of the surrounding ocean; explaining the kind of remuneration given to 
the proprietors of ships, and the expensiveness even of sending Missionaries. 
&#147;The people of Africa,&#148; said he, &#147;have already done so; for 
though, like us, they have no money, they have given of their sheep, and other 
property. Let us also give of the produce of our islands,&#151;pigs, or 
arrow-root, or cocoa-nut oil. Yet it must be voluntary, let it not be by 
compulsion. He that desires the word of God to grow where it has been planted, 
and to be conveyed to countries wretched as ours was before it was brought to 
us, will contribute freely and liberally to promote its extension: he who is 
unacquainted with its influence, and insensible to its claims, will not, 
perhaps, exert himself in this work. So let it be. Let him not be reproved; 
neither let the chiefs in general, nor his superiors, be angry with him on that 
account.&#148; Pomare on this occasion seemed anxious to impress the minds of 
the people with his desire that they should act according to the dictates of 
their own judgment, and not form themselves into a society, simply because he 
had recommended it. As he drew to the close of his address, he intimated his 
wish that those who approved of the proposal he had made, should lift up their 
right hands. Two or three thousand naked arms were simultaneously elevated from 
the multitude assembled under the cocoa-nut grove, presenting a spectacle no 
less imposing and affecting, than it was picturesque and new. The&#150; 270 
&#150; regulations of the society were then read, and the treasurer and 
secretaries chosen. By this time the shades of the evening began to gather 
round us, and the sun was just hidden by the distant wave of the horizon, when 
the king rose from his chair, and the chiefs and people retired to their 
dwellings, under feelings of excitement and satisfaction. There was so much 
rural beauty and secluded quietude in the scene, and so much that was novel and 
striking in the appearance of the people, momentous and delightful in the 
object for which they had been convened, that it was altogether an interesting 
meeting.<br>
<br>
 Mahine, and the Leeward or Society Island chiefs, who had 
been present at the formation of the Tahitian Missionary Society, were desirous 
that Huahine, although it had not been equally favoured with facilities for 
receiving the gospel, should not be behind any of the Windward group in the 
efforts of its inhabitants to sustain and to propagate it. In a few months 
after their arrival, therefore, they proposed that a society, upon the plan of 
that established in Eimeo, should be formed in Huahine, in aid of the parent 
society in London. We were anxious to aid in the accomplishment of their 
design; and a day was fixed, on which a public meeting was to be held for its 
formation. In the forenoon of the 6th of October, 1818, Mahine, and the 
Missionaries of Huahine, Tamatoa, and those of Raiatea, Mai, and numbers from 
Borabora, repaired to the chapel, followed by crowds of the people. The place 
was soon filled, and a far greater number remained outside than were assembled 
under the roof. In order that as many as possible might hear, directions were 
given to take down on of the ends of the house; this&#150; 271 &#150; was soon 
done; so that those who could not gain admission, were enabled to hear.<br>
<br>
 Temporary verandas or coverings of cocoa-nut leaves had been attached to the 
side of the house next the sea, widening it five or six feet, and on the other 
side it was also thrown open. A sermon was preached in the forenoon, and in the 
afternoon the people were addressed by Mahine, Taua, and other leading chiefs, 
on the advantages they had derived from the gospel, the destitute state of 
those who had not received it, and the obligation they were under to send it; 
proposing, at the same time, that each person, so disposed, should annually 
prepare a small quantity of cocoa-nut oil, which should be collected, sent to 
England, and sold, to aid the Society, which had sent teachers to Tahiti, in 
sending them to other nations.<br>
<br>
 Those who had been at Eimeo, and many 
of the inhabitants of Huahine, appeared interested in the details that were 
given of the condition of other parts of the world, and the efforts that had 
been made by Christians in England to send them the means of instruction. The 
presence of the chiefs of the different islands, with numbers of their people, 
the former devotees of their respective national idols, and the adherents of 
the different political parties, who had often within the last twenty years met 
for battle on the shores of Huahine or Raiatea, together with the novelty of 
the object, and the excitement of feeling which such a concourse of people 
necessarily produced, rendered the meeting exceedingly interesting, though to 
us it was less so than one subsequently held in Fare, and that which we had 
attended in Eimeo.</p> 
<p>&#150; 272 &#150;</p> 
<p>The Haweis having conveyed the Missionaries to their respective stations, 
taken in cocoa-nut oil, and such other productions of the islands as were 
marketable at Port Jackson, left Tahiti, and touched at Huahine, on her way to 
the colony of New South Wales. Messrs. Williams and Threlkeld had availed 
themselves of the visit of the Active, in the month of September, to remove 
with their families to Raiatea, and form a new station in that large and 
important island. Tamaota the king, and his brother, accompanied them, while 
the rest of the chiefs and people of that island followed in their boats and 
canoes. In the Haweis, which left Huahine early in December, 1818, Mr. Hayward, 
from Eimeo, proceeded on a voyage to Port Jackson, and Mr. and Mrs. Orsmond to 
Raiatea, while Messrs. Nott, Davies, Barff, and myself, remained at Huahine.<br>
<br> Our temporary dwelling was scarcely rendered comfortable, by partitioning 
the different rooms with bamboo-canes, and covering them with Tahitian cloth, 
when it was necessary to prepare for the erection of a printing-office, the 
supply of books brought from Eimeo being found unequal to the increasing 
demand. Mr. Nott was also revising, for the press, the Gospel by John, and Mr. 
Davies had the Gospel of Matthew ready. This rendered it expedient to examine 
the district, that we might select the most eligible place for the erection of 
our permanent dwelling, to which we purposed to attach the printing-office.<br>

<br> We were desirous of securing the advantages of garden-ground and water; 
but in seeking these, we avoided obliging the natives to remove from any of 
those spots which they had already appropriated&#150; 273 &#150; to their own 
use. In this there was not much difficulty, the whole district was before us, 
and but few places, except in the vicinity of the shore, had been selected by 
the people, who were waiting till we had made our choice, that they might build 
as near our dwelling as would be convenient.<br>
<br>
 We explored the district 
carefully, but often found the brushwood, and interlaced branches of the trees, 
so impervious, that, without a hatchet, we should have penetrated but a short 
distance from the winding paths trodden by the natives. The soil was good 
throughout; and, as the people had chosen the most eligible places along the 
shore, we fixed upon a small elevation near the junction of two clear and rapid 
streamlets, about a quarter of a mile from the entrance of the valley of 
Mahamene. It was at this time a complete wilderness, overgrown with weeds and 
brushwood. We commenced preparing it for the site of our dwelling; and when 
cleared, it was a most delightful spot.<br>
<br>
 A stream rolled at the bottom 
of a steep bank, about twenty yards from our house. Two or three aged and 
stately chestnut-trees growing on the margin of this bank, extended their 
branches over the steam and the bank, casting around a grateful and an inviting 
shelter from the noontide sun.<br>
<br>
 Immediately behind this spot, 
Matoereere, a black rock, the loftiest mountain in the island, towered in 
majesty above the surrounding hills. The lower part of the mountain appears 
basaltic; the central strata are composed of a vesicular kind of volcanic rock, 
while the upper parts are a large kind of<i>breccia</i>. It is verdant to its 
summit, which is of a beautiful conic shape, supported by a perpendicular&#150; 
274 &#150; rock. The inferior hills, on one side, were not only verdant, but to 
a considerable extent clothed with shrubs or trees, while a degree of sterile 
whiteness marked the basaltic and volcanic rocks on the other. These gave a 
richness and picturesque appearance to the landscape, which was greatly 
heightened by the lofty mountain in the centre. Often have I seen the mists and 
clouds resting on its sides, or encircling its brow, while the sunbeams have 
irradiated its summit; and it has appeared, especially when seen from a 
distance,</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>&#147;As some tall cliff that lifts its awful form, <br>
 Swells from the 
vale, and midway leaves the storm.&#148;</p> </blockquote> 
<p>On the northern side of the valley, and near the foot of Matoereere, we 
proposed to erect our dwelling and the printing-house. Mr. Davies selected a 
spot between this place and the sea, on the same side; and Mr. Orsmond fixed 
upon one near the southern border of the harbour, and on the opposite side of 
the valley of Mahamene, which was spacious, fertile, well watered, and 
sufficiently high to be secure from dampness.<br>
<br>
 The people readily 
erected the frame of our house and the printing-office, which was put up much 
in the same manner as that had been which we occupied in Eimeo; but, as it was 
intended for a more permanent abode, it was finished with greater care. It had 
but one floor, excepting, that over the printing-office there was a kind of 
loft for drying the paper. The front was boarded with materials brought from 
Port Jackson. The walls at the ends and the back were plastered with excellent 
coral lime; and both the printing-house and dwelling were floored with 
bread-fruit boards,&#150; 275 &#150; split or sawn by the natives; the windows 
in the bed-rooms, sitting-rooms, study, and printing-house, were glazed; and, 
what was a new and strange thing to the natives, our kitchen, in which was a 
stone oven, fire-place, and chimney, was included under the same roof.<br>
<br>

 Cooking-houses were usually detached from the dwellings of the chiefs and 
foreigners, but we attached it to our house, that Mrs. Ellis might avoid 
exposure to the sun, and heat of the middle of the day, whenever it might be 
necessary to superintend the dressing of our food. The partitions separating 
the different apartments were framed, wattled with thin sticks, and plastered; 
and although we found the labour of building oppressive, we were amply 
compensated by the comfort we subsequently enjoyed. The house was finished 
early in 1819, became our residence shortly afterwards, and continued so until 
we embarked for the Sandwich Islands.<br>
<br>
 Building houses, and avocations 
of a similar kind, were regarded as secondary objects; our main efforts were 
directed to the acquisition of the language. Whatever besides we had been able 
to do, we considered ourselves wholly inefficient, until we were capable of 
delivering our message to the inhabitants in their own tongue. We had many 
difficulties to encounter, and were obliged to pick up the greater part of the 
language from the natives, who, unacquainted with our speech, could only 
explain to us the meaning of words and phrases by their own: thus their 
explanations often increased our perplexity. My intimate acquaintance with all 
that had been printed, afforded me great facility in prosecuting the study of 
Tahitian. In less than a year, I was able to converse with the people on&#150; 
276 &#150; common topics, and preached my first sermon in Tahitian in the month 
of November, 1818.<br>
<br>
 I was much affected on giving up myself to 
Missionary pursuits, on leaving England, and on reaching the islands, but I had 
never so deeply felt the responsibility of my situation, and my insufficiency 
for the work, as I did on the day when I delivered my first native discourse. 
The congregation was large, the chiefs and Missionaries were present; and, at 
the appointed time, I commenced the services with reading and prayer, exercises 
in which I had occasionally engaged before. I had selected for the text what 
appeared a most suitable passage with which to commence my public ministry: 
&#147;This is a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ 
Jesus came into the world to save sinners,&#148; I Tim. i. 15. I was enabled to 
conclude the service with less difficulty than I expected, and was happy to 
have an opportunity of declaring, though very imperfectly, truths that were 
able to make those to whom they were delivered, wise unto salvation, through 
faith in Christ Jesus. In continuing my labours, I found it necessary, on 
account of the peculiarities of the native language, to write out most of my 
discourses, and commit them to memory, before I could venture to address them 
to the people.<br>
<br>
 The establishment of schools, the reducing to writing, 
and a regular grammatical system, uncultivated and oral languages, and the 
translation of the sacred Scriptures, have ever been acknowledged as important, 
if not essential parts of a Missionary's duty; but the promulgation of the 
gospel by the living voice has always been considered by us as the primary, 
and, wherever&#150; 277 &#150; practicable, the best means of converting the 
heathen; and though the other departments of labour have not been neglected, 
this has been regarded as the first great duty of a Missionary&#151;according 
with his very designation, the principal design of the institution under whose 
patronage he is engaged, the practice of the apostles and first Missionaries, 
and the spirit as well as the letter of the Divine commission, whence he 
derives his highest sanction, and anticipates greatest success. Preparation for 
this service has therefore been regarded as demanding particular attention.<br>

<br> After our arrival at Huahine, in addition to the preparation of their 
dwellings, Messrs. Nott and Davies had been employed in preaching to the 
people, and preparing the Gospels of Matthew and John for the press. In the 
schools, Mr. Barff had been much engaged, and Mr. Orsmond, prior to his removal 
to Raiatea, had assisted in the instruction of the people, not only of Fare, 
but also of the adjoining districts.<br>
<br>
 The indolence of the South Sea 
Islanders has long been proverbial, and our minds were not less affected on 
beholding it, than those of other visitors had been. We were convinced that it 
was the parent of many of their crimes, infant-murder not excepted, and was 
also a perpetual source of misery. The warmth of the climate, the spontaneous 
abundance with which the earth and the sea furnished, not merely the 
necessaries of life, but what was to the inhabitants the means of luxurious 
indulgence, had, no doubt, strengthened their natural love of ease, and 
nurtured those habits of excessive indolence in which they passed the greater 
portion of their lives.<br>
<br>
 These habits, so perfectly congenial to their 
&#150; 278 &#150; uncultivated minds, to the fugitive manner of life, mirthful 
disposition, and rude state of society that prevailed among the islanders, 
appeared one of the most formidable barriers to their receiving our 
instructions, imbibing the spirit and exhibiting the moral influence of 
religion, and advancing in civilization. All classes were alike insensible to 
the gratification arising from mental improvement, and ignorant of the 
enjoyments of social and domestic life, the comforts of home, and the 
refinements and conveniences which arts and labour add to the bestowments of 
Providence. The difficulties we encountered resulted not less from the 
inveteracy of their idle habits, than from the absence of all inducements to 
labour, that were sufficiently powerful to call into action their dormant 
energies. Their wants were few, and their desires limited to the means of mere 
animal existence and enjoyment; these were supplied without much anxiety or 
effort, and, possessing these, they were satisfied.<br>
<br>
 During the early 
periods of their residence in the islands, our predecessors often endeavoured 
to rouse them from their abject and wretched modes of life, by advising them to 
build more comfortable dwellings, to wear more decent clothing, and to adopt, 
so far as circumstances would admit, the conveniences and comforts of 
Europeans. While the inhabitants continued heathens, their endeavours were 
altogether unavailing. The people frequently said, &#147;We should like some of 
these things very well, but we cannot have them without working; that we do not 
like, and therefore would rather do without them. The bananas and the 
plantains, &amp;c. ripen on the trees, and the pigs fatten on the fruits that 
are strewed beneath them,&#150; 279 &#150; even while we sleep; these are all 
we want, why therefore should we work?&#148;</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>&#147;They knew no higher, sought no happier state, <br>
 Had no fine 
instinct of superior joys.<br>
 Why should they toil to make the earth bring 
forth,<br>
 When without toil she gave them all they wanted? <br>
 The 
bread-fruit ripened, while they lay beneath<br>
 Its shadows in luxurious 
indolence;<br>
 The cocoa filled its nuts with milk and kernels; <br>
 And 
while they slumbered from their heavy meals,<br>
 In dead forgetfulness of life 
itself,<br>
 The fish were spawning in unsounded depths: <br>
 Unplanted roots 
were thriving under ground,<br>
 To spread the tables of their future 
banquets!&#148;</p> </blockquote> 
<p>They furnish a striking illustration of the sentiment, that to civilize a 
people they must first be Christianized; that to attempt the former without the 
latter, is like rearing a superstructure without a foundation. A change in 
their views and feelings had now taken place, and, learning from the 
Scriptures, that idleness, and irregular and debasing habits of life, were as 
opposed to the principles of Christianity, as to their own personal comfort; 
they were disposed to attend to the recommendations of their teachers in this, 
as well as other matters.<br>
<br>
 Industry, however, soon languishes, unless 
nurtured by more powerful motives than the effects of abstract principles upon 
partially enlightened and ill-regulated minds. To increase their wants, or to 
make some of the comforts and decencies of society as desirable as the bare 
necessaries of life, appeared to us the most probable method of furnishing 
incitements to permanent industry. It was therefore recommended to them to 
erect for themselves more comfortable dwellings, and cultivate a larger 
quantity of ground, to meet the&#150; 280 &#150; exigencies of those seasons of 
scarcity which they often experienced during the intervals between the 
bread-fruit crops. We also persuaded them to use such articles of our clothing 
as were adapted to their climate and habits, and to adopt our social and 
domestic habits of life. This not only required a considerable addition of 
personal labour, but a variety of articles that could not be supplied on the 
islands, and must be obtained through the medium of commerce with Port Jackson 
and England; and they could only procure these articles, in a degree equal to 
that in which they multiplied the productions of the soil, so as to be able to 
exchange them for the manufactured goods of civilized countries.<br>
<br>
 None 
of the spontaneous productions of the islands were available for purposes of 
barter or exportation. The sandal-wood of the Sandwich Islands, and the 
pine-timber of New Zealand, produced, without effort on the part of the 
inhabitants, being valuable commodities, and, given in exchange for the 
articles conveyed by foreign vessels to their shores, afforded great 
inducements to commercial adventure, and furnished the natives of those 
countries with facilities for increasing their resources and their comforts, of 
which the Tahitians were destitute. Whatever articles of export they could ever 
expect to furnish, must be the product of their own industry; this we were 
desirous to direct in channels the most profitable, such as were best suited to 
their means, and congenial to their previous habits. We therefore recommended 
them to direct their attention to the culture of cotton, one variety of which 
appeared to be an indigenous plant in most of the islands. Several valuable 
kinds of cotton having been at&#150; 281 &#150; different times introduced, 
were also growing remarkably well.<br>
<br>
 Soon after we reached Huahine, a 
number of those who accompanied us from Eimeo, with some of the chiefs of the 
island, united in clearing and fencing a large piece of ground, which they 
planted with the best seeds they could procure, and called<i> aua vavae</i>, 
cotton-garden. The females were the most active in this work. Whether they were 
more anxious than the other sex to obtain foreign articles of dress, and the 
conveniences and the comforts of domestic life&#151;or whether, feeling more 
peculiarly their obligations to Christianity, and desiring to take the lead in 
the introduction of those habits which they had been taught to consider as the 
necessary result of its principles, and the accompaniments of a Christian 
profession&#151;it is unnecessary to determine; but they laboured diligently 
and perseveringly, cutting down in the mountains wood for the fencing, 
employing their own servants to transport it to the shore, clearing away the 
brushwood, enclosing the ground, digging the soil, planting the seed, watching 
with constancy its growth, and carefully gathering the cotton.<br>
<br>
 In 
order to encourage and direct them by our example, Messrs. Barff, Orsmond, and 
myself, having obtained permission from the owners of the valley in which we 
resided, employed natives to clear away the trees and bushes with which it was 
overgrown, for the purpose of planting it with coffee, sugar cane, or cotton. 
On this we also bestowed personally many an hour, desirous not only to afford 
those who were inclined to follow our advice, and cultivate the earth for 
articles of commerce, the encouragement of our counsel and&#150; 282 &#150; 
direction, but to demonstrate the practicability of accomplishing, by means 
within their power, what had been proposed.<br>
<br>
 The directors of the 
Missionary Society were fully sensible of the necessity of introducing a 
regular system of industry among the islanders, in order to their assuming and 
maintaining a station amongst Christian or civilized nations; and felt that the 
interesting and peculiar circumstances of the people at this time, required 
something beyond the inculcation of the principles of Christianity, and 
instruction in the use of letters. They justly inferred, that, unless habits of 
industry were introduced, and civilization promoted, the people, if they did 
not absolutely return to all the absurdities, superstition, and cruelty of 
paganism, would develop but partially the genius and spirit of Christianity, 
and exercise very imperfectly its practical virtues. The state of feeling, 
also, that prevailed among the inhabitants at this time, predisposed them 
readily to attend to any recommendations of the kind; and the great deference 
they now paid to the counsel of their teachers, presented an opportunity more 
favourable than had ever occurred before, or was likely to occur again.<br>
<br>
 Influenced by these considerations, the Directors sent to the South Sea 
Islands Mr. Gyles, a gentleman who had been many years manager of a plantation 
in Jamaica, and who, being well acquainted with the culture of the cane, and 
the manufacture of sugar, was furnished by the Missionary Society with the 
necessary machinery and apparatus for introducing this branch of industry. Mr. 
Gyles was engaged for four years, during which time it was supposed he would be 
able, not only to commence&#150; 283 &#150; his operations, but to proceed so 
as to convince the kind and chiefs what might be done, and also to improve the 
natives in the art of cultivating cane, instruct them in the process of 
boiling, &amp;c. and leave them capable of carrying it on by themselves. He 
reached Tahiti in August, 1818, and shortly afterwards removed to Eimeo, where 
the began to erect the machinery, and enclosed a considerable tract of ground 
in the fertile and extensive valley at the head of the beautiful bay of 
Opunohu, usually called Taloo Harbour. Circumstances detained the king at 
Tahiti for many months after Mr. Gyles's arrival in Eimeo, and retarded very 
materially the progress of the undertaking. Sugarcane was, however, procured 
from the gardens of the adjacent districts, and sugar made in the presence of 
the natives, who were delighted on discovering that an article, so highly 
esteemed, could be made on their own shores, from the spontaneous product of 
their soil.<br>
<br>
 But the advantageous and expensive arrangements of the 
Directors, for the purpose of introducing these important branches of commerce 
and productive labour, although not entirely frustrated, were in the first 
instance rendered to a great degree unavailing, by the unfounded reports of 
unprincipled and interested individuals, who beheld the advancement of the 
people in knowledge and civilization with any other feelings than those of 
satisfaction.<br>
<br>
 Early in the year 1819, the captain of a vessel, the 
Indus, whom purposes of commerce led to Tahiti, informed the king that Mr. 
Gyles's errand to Tahiti was merely experimental; and that, should the attempt 
to manufacture sugar succeed, individuals from the distant countries, 
possessing influence&#150; 284 &#150; and large resources, would establish 
themselves in the islands, and, with an armed force, which he would in vain 
attempt to oppose, would either destroy the inhabitants, or reduce them to 
slavery. These alarming statements were strengthened by allusion to the present 
state of the West Indies, where Mr. Gyles had been engaged in the manufacture 
of sugar and the culture of coffee. This device was employed for a short time 
with success against the establishment of the Mission among the Sandwich 
Islands; where the king and chiefs were told, that though foreigners first went 
in a peaceable and friendly manner to the West Indies, they subsequently went 
with all the apparatus of war, attacked and defeated the inhabitants, hunted 
the fugitives with blood-hounds, finally exterminated them, and remained 
masters of the islands.<br>
<br>
 Though the inconsistency of this statement 
with the defenceless manner in which the Missionaries had come amongst them, 
would have been self-evident to an enlightened mind,&#151;being supported by an 
incontrovertible historical fact, it was remarkably adapted to operate 
powerfully upon an individual but partially informed, and exceedingly 
suspicious of every measure that might permanently alienate the smallest 
portion of territory, or lead to the establishment of foreign proprietorship, 
and consequent influence, in the islands.<br>
<br>
 This view of the enterprise 
led Pomare to decline rendering that assistance which was expected, and the 
want to which retarded the progress of the work. The necessary labour required 
from the natives was paid for at a remarkably high price, and often difficult 
to obtain on any terms.<br>
<br>
 Matters continued in this state until the 
month of May, 1819, when a national assembly of the chiefs&#150; 285 &#150; and 
people from Tahiti and Eimeo met a Papaoa, in the district of Pare. The 
Missionaries from the several stations assembled at the same period, for the 
purpose of commemorating the anniversary of the Tahitian Auxiliary Missionary 
Society.<br>
<br>
 Before they returned, the king informed them, that, 
apprehensive of unfavourable results from the reports already in circulation 
among the chiefs and people, he could not consent to the prosecution of the 
manufacture of sugar, &amp;c., excepting on a very limited scale. Pomare was 
not hasty in forming his decision on any matter of importance, and by no means 
precipitate in his measures; but on this occasion he appears to have been 
altogether uninfluenced by that temperate deliberation, and judicious policy, 
which he generally manifested in matters tending to improve the condition of 
the people, and increase the national resources.<br>
<br>
 The Missionaries 
also appear to have been so strongly influenced by the king's communication, 
that, instead of endeavouring to remove his objections, by persuading him to 
allow the trial to be fairly made, and then to act accordingly, they deemed it 
expedient, that so far as they, or the Society by which the machinery had, at 
great expense, been sent out, were concerned, it should be at once 
discontinued. Accordingly, on the 14th of May, &#147;in order to satisfy the 
king, and quiet the minds of the people,&#148; they advised Mr. Gyles &#147;to 
return to New South Wales by the first conveyance.&#148;<br>
<br>
 Shortly 
after this decision, communications from England required a general meeting of 
the Missionaries from the several stations; and Messrs. Williams, Barff, and 
myself, went up from the&#150; 286 &#150; Leeward Islands to Tahiti and Eimeo. 
By the same conveyance Mr. and Mrs. Nott removed to Tahiti, where Mr. Nott has 
since laboured in Matavai, or the adjacent district of Pare. We were detained 
there about a fortnight; during which period we received from Mr. Gyles much 
information on the culture of the plant, and the manufacture of sugar. Before 
we left, Mr. Gyles very obligingly had a quantity of cane bruised and boiled, 
that we might not only understand the theory, but witness the process of 
grinding canes, boiling the juice, and granulating the syrup, so as to 
introduce it among the inhabitants of the Leeward Islands.<br>
<br>
 Our 
business at Tahiti being finished, Messrs. Barff, Williams, and myself, with a 
number of natives, sailed from Eimeo about noon, on the 12th of August, in an 
open boat belonging to Mr. Hayward. Before the sun had set, we had nearly lost 
sight of the island; and when the night gathered round us, we found ourselves 
in the midst of the vast Pacific, in a very small and fragile bark, without 
compass or nautical instrument, or any other means of directing our way than 
the luminaries of heaven. The night, however, was cloudless, and</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>&#147;Star after star, from some unseen abyss, <br>
 Came through the sky, 
till all the firmament<br>
 Was thronged with constellations, and the sea <br>
 
Strewn with their images.&#148;</p> </blockquote> 
<p>The interval between the close of the evening and the dawn of the following 
day was pleasantly spent; and soon after sun-rise, on the morning of the 13th, 
we were gladdened by the sight of the lofty mountains in Huahine, which were 
seen&#150; 287 &#150; above the line of clouds that rested on the western 
horizon. About five in the afternoon of the same day, Mr. Barff and myself were 
restored to our families; thankful for the guidance and protection we had 
enjoyed on the voyage, and the merciful care which those we left had 
experienced during our absence.<br>
<br>
 The facility with which the 
manufacture of sugar might be carried on by the people, and the certain market 
it would always find in Port Jackson should they be able to furnish more than 
their own necessities required, induced us not only to recommend it to the 
natives, but also to plant with sugarcane the ground already cleared and 
enclosed.<br>
<br>
 The proprietors of the cotton garden watched the progress 
of the plants with care and anxiety, accompanied probably with some of those 
golden dreams of future emolument which frequently operate very powerfully on 
the minds of individuals commencing an enterprise, which, although in some 
degree uncertain as to its results, yet promises, upon the whole, an increase 
of wealth or enjoyment. Unhappily for them, the ground they had chosen was 
unsuitable, and many of the plants were not productive. The first crop, 
however, was gathered, the seeds carefully picked out, and the cotton packed in 
baskets. When a ship arrived, they were eager to dispose of it, expecting far 
more in return than the warmest encouragement in its culture had ever 
warranted. Their estimate of its value had been formed according to its bulk; 
and when it was weighed, and they saw a large basket-full weigh only two or 
three pounds, and a proportionate price offered, they were greatly 
disappointed. They brought back their&#150; 288 &#150; cotton, and hung it up 
in their houses till another ship arrived, when it was again presented for 
sale; but being again estimated by weight, little if any more was offered for 
it. Some sold what they had collected, others were so disappointed, that they 
seemed hardly to care what became of it. This circumstance, together with the 
length of time and the constant attention that a cotton plantation required, 
before any return could be received, greatly discouraged them, and prevented 
their continuing its culture. They chose rather to feed a number of pigs, or 
cultivate the vegetables in demand by the shipping, dispose of them when 
vessels might put in for refreshments, and receive at once in exchange, 
articles of cloth, &amp;c. than wait till the crops should be gathered, and 
experience so much uncertainty, or meet with such annoying disappointments in 
the amount of their returns.<br>
<br>
 Mr. Gyles, on his way to the colony of 
New South Wales in the month of August 1819, spent some time at Huahine and 
Raiatea; and we gladly availed ourselves of his visit, to make further 
inquiries relative to the object for which he had come to the islands. Some 
spare machinery and boilers, sent out by the Society, were also left at 
Huahine. Assisted by the natives, we subsequently erected a rustic mill; and, 
when the cane in our plantation was ripe, commenced our endeavours to convert 
it into sugar. The cylinders for crushing the cane were perpendicular: an ox 
was trained to draw in the mill. He was yoked to a lever on one side of the 
central roller; a number of natives, pushing at another on the opposite side, 
turned the mill, and pressed the juice from the cane. The natives were 
surprised at the&#150; 289 &#150; quantity of juice from a single cane, as they 
had never been accustomed to see it thus collected, but had generally broken it 
in small pieces, and, by masticating the cane, extracted the juice.<br>
<br>
 
After boiling it some time, we added the temper, or mixture of lime and water; 
and when we supposed the quantity had been sufficiently reduced, directed the 
natives to remove it to a suitable vessel for cooling, the progress of which we 
watched very anxiously, and, ultimately, had the satisfaction of beholding 
fine-grained crystals of sugar formed from the liquid. The natives were 
delighted and astonished; and although our surprise was not less than theirs, 
our satisfaction was more chastened; for, notwithstanding we had succeeded so 
well in our first attempt, we considered it more the result of accident than 
skill, and were by no means confident that, in a second effort, we should be 
equally successful.<br>
<br>
 We were, however, sufficiently encouraged to 
recommend the people, notwithstanding their disappointment in regard to the 
cotton, to direct their attention to the culture of sugar, since they had no 
longer any cause to doubt the practicability of procuring, from their 
respective plantations, sugar for their own use, or for barter with shipping. 
Our advice was not unheeded; several of the chiefs were induced to cultivate 
the cane; the mill we had erected became a kind of public machine, to which 
they brought their produce; and although, in some instances, we failed in 
procuring good sugar, in time the people were so well acquainted with the 
process, as to be able to boil it themselves. The Missionaries in Raiatea also 
erected a mill more efficient than the one we had constructed in Huahine, 
cultivated a quantity of&#150; 290 &#150; cane, made sugar themselves, and 
taught the inhabitants of the island to do the same.<br>
<br>
 Sugarcane grows 
spontaneously in all the South Sea islands, and more than ten varieties are 
indigenous. It has been stated, that the best canes now cultivated in the West 
Indies, are the kinds taken thither by Captain Bligh. In their native islands 
they grow remarkably fine. I have frequently seen canes as thick as a man's 
wrist, and ten or twelve feet between the root and the leaves. The<i>irimotu</i>
, a large yellow cane, and the<i>to-ura</i>, of a dark red colour, grow very 
large, and yield an abundance of juice, but the<i>patu</i>, a small light-red, 
long-jointed cane, with a thin husk or skin, contains the greatest quantity of 
saccharine matter. Some of the sugar manufactured by Mr. Gyles was of a very 
superior quality; and if hired labour were less expensive, or the people more 
industrious, it might be raised with facility in considerable quantities. The 
return, however, is distant, and the crops are less productive than many other 
articles that might be cultivated in the islands, especially unconnected with 
the distillation of rum from the refuse of the juice, or the molasses of the 
sugar. This is probably the only plan that would render it profitable; but to 
the use of rum, the present chiefs, of the Leeward or Society Islands, are 
averse; its introduction since embracing Christianity, they have been able to 
prevent; and it will be matter of deepest regret, if either they or their 
successors should favour its distillation on the islands, or its importation 
from abroad. Next to idolatry, and the diseases introduced by foreigners, it is 
the greatest scourge that has ever spread its desolations through their 
country, and we cannot deprecate in terms too strong; the&#150; 291 &#150; 
conduct of those who now visit these shores, and who, insensible to any other 
consideration than that of avarice or vice, spare no pains to introduce ardent 
spirits among the people, and promote its use.<br>
<br>
 But although these 
circumstances have hitherto operated against the general culture of the cane, 
the chiefs and some of the people make sugar for their own consumption, and 
have occasionally supplied captains of ships, who have wished to replenish 
their sea-stock. In this respect, although the attempt of the Directors to 
introduce extensively its cultivation, has failed in the first instance; the 
natives have, nevertheless, acquired, from Mr. Gyles's residence among them, an 
acquaintance with the process of manufacturing this valuable article of 
commerce, which, it is presumed, will prove to the nation an important and a 
permanent advantage.<br>
<br>
 The Haweis, in returning to the islands in the 
spring of 1819, touched at Norfolk Islands, formerly an appendage to the colony 
of New South Wales, and I believe re-occupied since that period. From this 
island the captain brought away a number of young coffee plants, which, on his 
arrival in the islands, were distributed among the different stations. The 
tender plants were once or twice removed, and all perished, excepting those in 
my garden at Huahine, which I was happy to succeed in preserving. The climate 
was favourable to their growth, and they appeared to thrive well. After four 
years, each tree bore about forty berries, which when perfectly ripe were 
gathered, and sent to the several stations. They were planted, and have since 
flourished, so that in every island the coffee plant is now growing, and it may 
be cultivated&#150; 292 &#150; to almost any extent. The chiefs are fond of 
coffee as a beverage, and, with the people, will doubtless raise it for their 
own use; and as it requires but comparatively little attention, probably it may 
be furnished in a greater abundance than either sugar or cotton.<br>
<br>
 The 
tobacco plant is another exotic, common now in all the islands: it was 
introduced by Capt. Cook, and has since been grown by the natives merely for 
their own use. Mr. Williams encouraged its cultivation to a considerable extent 
in the island of Raiatea, and the natives were taught to prepare it for the 
market of New South Wales, in a manner that rendered the Raiatean tobacco equal 
to any brought into Sydney. A lucrative branch of industry and commerce now 
appeared open to the enterprising and industrious inhabitants, when a heavy 
duty, which, according to report, in order to favour its growth in New Holland, 
was laid upon all taken into the port of Sydney, prevented their continuing its 
culture with the least expectation of profit. It was therefore in a great 
degree abandoned. The information, however, which the inhabitants received from 
the individual whom Mr. Williams employed to instruct them, not only in its 
growth, but in the methods of preparing it in the different forms under which 
it is offered in the markets, was valuable; and though no very advantageous 
results have hitherto followed, it may hereafter be productive of good.</p>

<br>
 Although the measures adopted by 
the Directors of the Missionary Society, for encouraging industry among the 
South Sea Islanders, and furnishing them with a source of productive labour in 
the manufacture of sugar, had not accomplished all that was designed, and Mr. 
Gyles had returned to England before the expiration of the period for which he 
had been engaged, the Directors still considered that it was their duty to 
endeavour to promote the temporal prosperity of the people&#151;that the 
introduction of useful mechanic arts, and other means of advancing their 
civilization, though&#150; 294 &#150; objects of only secondary importance, 
were not to be overlooked. Some stimulus to more regular employment than that 
to which the natives had been accustomed, during the indolent state of society 
from which they were emerging, was still necessary for their individual 
happiness, as well as their national prosperity.<br>
<br>
 The Directors of the 
Missionary Society were not influenced by their own choice, but by the 
necessities of the people, in making these and other secular arrangements, 
which were not contemplated in the original constitution and object of their 
association, but have resulted from the changes effected by their agents in the 
circumstances of those communities among which they have resided; and have 
sometimes involved an expense which could not always be met without difficulty. 
These collateral exertions often occasion embarrassment, and it would be highly 
gratifying, if other institutions were able to prosecute those departments of 
effort, which are rather appendages than proper parts of Missionary labour. 
Were the resources of those societies formed for the universal diffusion of 
education, and the means of the British and Foreign Bible Society such as to 
enable them to undertake entirely the instruction of the heathen, and the 
translation and circulation of the Scriptures, it would greatly facilitate the 
extension of Christianity. If, in addition to those already in existence, there 
was also an institution for the promotion of agriculture, mechanic arts, social 
order, and the general civilization of rude and barbarous tribes, such a 
society would exert a beneficial and powerful influence, and furnish an 
important agency, in conjunction with those now engaged. It would enable 
Missionary institutions&#150; 295 &#150; to follow more energetically their 
simple and primary labours, in sending forth messengers to preach the gospel to 
the heathen.<br>
<br>
 Such a society, however, did not exist. The promotion of 
industry and civil improvement were important objects, and, in order to 
accomplish them, especially in reference to the rising generation, two 
artisans, Messrs. Blossom and Armitage, were sent out with the deputation who 
visited the South Seas in 1821. The former was a carpenter, acquainted with the 
construction of machinery and wood-work in general; a department of labour 
highly advantageous to a rude, or but partially civilized people, and at this 
time in great estimation among the Tahitians. Mr. Blossom has been engaged in 
teaching native youth, and others, these arts; and though not altogether so 
successful as he desired, has nevertheless seen two or three excellent workmen 
trained under his care.<br>
<br>
 The introduction among an indolent people, of 
any art that requires constant, and sometimes heavy labour, must be gradual; 
but as building, and the use of household furniture, &amp;c., increases among 
the people, skill in these departments will be held in higher esteem, and the 
number of workmen will necessarily increase with the demand for their labour, 
and the remuneration it receives.<br>
<br>
 It was known, that with but slight 
attention the cotton-plant might be cultivated in the islands to almost any 
extent; and it was supposed, that although the smallness of the returns it had 
brought, when offered for sale in the raw state, together with the difficulties 
attending their first attempt, had deterred the people from persevering in its 
culture; yet that they might be induced to resume it, if taught on the spot to 
manufacture cotton&#150; 296 &#150; cloth. This was an article in great and 
constant demand throughout the islands. Mr. Armitage was therefore sent to 
attempt to teach the natives to spin and weave the cotton grown in their own 
gardens. He was a native of Manchester, where the members of his family still 
reside. He was well qualified for the undertaking, possessing an intimate 
acquaintance with the various processes by which raw cotton is made into cloth, 
and having been overseer or foreman of an extensive manufactory.<br>
<br>
 In 
acceding to the proposal of the Directors, and engaging in this enterprise, he 
manifested a degree of devotedness seldom excelled. He exchanged inviting 
prospects of wealth, comfort, and usefulness at home, for the toil and 
self-denial inseparable from such an attempt. The gentleman who had hitherto 
been his employer had proposed to make him his partner, had arranged for the 
advance of a very considerable sum of money; part of the materials for 
commencing the new establishment were procured, and the results in that line of 
business have since been such, as to warrant the inference, that every 
advantage the parties anticipated might have been realized. This, however, he 
relinquished, and cheerfully engaged in an attempt to promote the industry of 
the islanders, with no other remuneration than the Missionaries receive&#151;a 
bare supply of the necessaries of life.<br>
<br>
 It may, perhaps, be thought 
that I am trespassing the bounds of propriety in giving these particulars to 
the public; but, in this instance, and there are others that might also be 
adduced, I feel it due, not more to the individual than to the cause in which 
he is embarked; to the friends by whom&#150; 297 &#150; it is supported; and 
even to those who, in consequence of mistaken views, and misrepresentation, may 
sometimes be induced to suppose mercenary motives influence those who engage in 
Missionary undertakings.<br>
<br>
 In the month of September, 1821, they 
reached Tahiti. The carding machine, looms, &amp;c. were landed, and placed 
under the care of Paiti, a chief residing near the harbour of Taone; and in the 
adjacent village of Pirae, Messrs. Armitage and Blossom took up their abode.<br>
<br> Like every other undertaking that has yet been made to benefit the people, 
the cotton factory had to contend with great difficulty. At first the king and 
chiefs, under the recollection of the reported design and tendency of the sugar 
manufactory, expressed their wishes that the establishment should be formed 
near their principal residence, that all proceedings connected with it might be 
under their inspection. Subsequently, when they entered into its design, and 
began to consider that it would become a source of pecuniary advantage, 
although it was thought that Eimeo would be most eligible for its 
establishment, the chiefs of Pare and the adjoining districts refused to allow 
the machinery to be removed. In this state matters remained some 
time&#151;several of the finer parts of the iron-work were destroyed by the 
rust, and the whole greatly injured.<br>
<br>
 The deputation and the 
Missionaries, however, considering that the island of Eimeo afforded the 
greatest facilities for carrying on the work, removed it thither, and with 
great expense and labour Messrs. Armitage and Blossom erected the machinery, 
and commenced their work. Shortly after this was completed, Mr. Blossom removed 
to the&#150; 298 &#150; opposite side of the island, to take charge of the 
secular concerns of the South Sea Academy, and the work has since been carried 
on by Mr. Armitage alone.<br>
<br>
 The machinery, &amp;c. were considered as 
belonging to the Missionary Society, but at a public meeting held in Eimeo, in 
May 1824, for the purpose of arranging the principles upon which its future 
operations should be conducted, it was distinctly stated by the deputation, and 
recognized by the Missionaries, &#147;That the Society contemplates no other 
advantage in promoting the manufacture of cloth by this machinery, than the 
good of the inhabitants of these islands;&#148; &#147;That no charges by way of 
profit shall be made upon the cloth manufactured and sold to the inhabitants, 
more than is merely necessary to defray the expenses attending it,&#148; and 
&#147;That all the inhabitants of the islands connected with both the Windward 
and Leeward Missions, shall be allowed to share alike in the advantages of this 
manufactory.&#148; At the same time it was recommended, that two young men and 
two young women from each island, should be sent, to learn the art of making 
looms, spinning, weaving, &amp;c.<br>
<br>
 The work commenced with cotton 
belonging to the native Missionary Societies. Mr. Armitage taught them to card 
the cotton, and Mrs. Armitage instructed them in spinning. Their first 
attempts, as might be expected, were exceedingly awkward, and the warp they 
furnished was difficult to weave. One piece of cloth, however, fifty yards in 
length, was finished, and presented to the king. Its appearance was coarse, and 
inferior to the imported calicoes of British manufacture; it was nevertheless 
grateful to the chiefs, from the fact of its&#150; 299 &#150; being the first 
ever manufactured in their own islands.<br>
<br>
 Cotton for another piece was 
prepared, and the natives commenced spinning; but the confinement required 
being irksome, and their expectation rather lowered, as to the quality of the 
cloth they were to receive as wages for their labour,&#151;before the warp was 
ready for the loom, they simultaneously discontinued their work. When 
interrogated as to their reasons for this sudden change in their conduct, it 
was found that they had not indeed struck for higher wages, but had left off to 
think about it, and that, until their minds were made up, they could not 
return. The spinning-wheels and the loom now stood still, excepting that Mrs. 
Armitage and Mrs. Blossom, with the assistance of their own servants, spun the 
cotton, which Mr. Armitage wove into about fifty yards of cloth, for the use of 
the academy.<br>
<br>
 Notwithstanding the inferior appearance of the cloth 
manufactured in Eimeo, it was soon found to be more durable than that procured 
from the ships. Yet the disappointment which the natives had experienced 
prevented their cultivating the cotton; and but little was available for the 
establishment, excepting that subscribed by the members of the native 
Missionary Societies: the people declined coming to learn, and prospects were 
most unpromising. This, however, was not the only source of discouragement.<br>

<br> Traders, influenced by the narrow views and interested motives which too 
frequently regulate the proceedings of those who traffic with uncivilized 
nations, employed a variety of inducements to prevent the natives affording any 
encouragement to the establishment. At one time they assured them&#150; 300 
&#150; that it would be injurious to their interest, and, if successful, 
prevent their being visited by shipping, &amp;c., offering, at the same time, 
to give them for their raw cotton twice as much cloth as they could procure at 
the factory. At other times they threatened Mr. Armitage with ruin, and 
announced their determination to oppose him. Sometimes they endeavoured to 
persuade him to abandon so hopeless a project, as that of attempting to train 
the people to habits of industry.<br>
<br>
 Their threatenings to seek his 
ruin, by opposing his efforts, are rather amusing. They doubtless supposed the 
attempt was on his part a speculation for the accumulation of wealth; the only 
end which most propose, who visit those island; and which, when pursued on fair 
upright principles, is not to be condemned. These proceedings, however, must 
have originated in very contracted views of the influence of such an 
establishment, which, while it may induce and encourage habits of more regular 
employment, can never diminish the demand for British calicoes, which will be 
superior in texture, pattern, &amp;c. to any that can be made in the islands. 
It will also tend to encourage the more extensive culture of the cotton, and, 
in the raw state, the natives will never decline disposing of it to him who 
offers the best price.<br>
<br>
 Notwithstanding these and various other 
discouragements, Mr. Armitage was able to persevere; and as there was little 
prospect of the females he had taught to spin making up their minds to return, 
another party was selected. Nearly twenty girls, and eight or ten boys, engaged 
to learn to spin and weave. The conditions on which they were instructed were 
almost such as they or their friends chose to propose, both as to&#150; 301 
&#150; the time they should continue, and the hours they should labour; and 
instead of receiving a premium for teaching them, Mr. Armitage agreed to pay 
them for every ounce of cotton they should spin.<br>
<br>
 In every undertaking 
of this kind, the greatest embarrassments attend its outset, and the same 
difficulties that had suspended the instruction of the two former parties, were 
again to be overcome. The indolent habits of these young persons, their 
impatience of control, and the fugitive mode of life to which many had been 
accustomed, were not to be at once removed. Recent accounts, however, convey 
the intelligence, that the prospect of ultimately introducing this branch of 
labour extensively among the people, is more encouraging than formerly. The 
females were able to spin strong and regular thread, or yarn; one or two of the 
boys had been taught to make, all things considered, very good cloth. Mr. 
Armitage has also succeeded in dying the cloth, and thus furnishing different 
patterns and colours, which has greatly increased its value in their 
estimation. While the hands of the parties spinning or weaving are employed, 
the improvement of their minds is not neglected. Reading-lessons and passages 
of scripture are affixed to the walls and different parts of the factory.<br>

<br> The carding engine, and some of the other parts of the machinery, were 
turned by a large waterwheel, but the work has often been retarded by the 
repairs that the wheel or its appendages have required.<br>
<br>
 Several of 
the best native carpenters have, however, readily come forward to repair the 
wheel, and have received their payment in cloth made at the&#150; 302 &#150; 
factory. The derangement of the machinery suspending the work of the spinners, 
some of them requested to take the cotton home, to prepare and spin at their 
own houses. The experiment has succeeded beyond what was anticipated, and the 
natives now bring to the factory for sale the cotton-yarn spun at their own 
dwellings, and ready for the loom.<br>
<br>
 This circumstance, though 
insignificant, is interesting and important. The natives are now convinced that 
they can make cloth; others, besides those taught in the factory, we may expect 
will desire to learn; and as they can prepare and spin the cotton at their own 
dwellings, this employment, which is certainly adapted to their climate and 
habits, as they can take it up and lay it down at their convenience, will 
probably be very extensively followed through the islands. The native 
carpenters will be able to make looms, as they have made turning-lathes, which, 
though rude, will be such as to answer their purpose. The spinning-wheel will 
also become an article of furniture in their houses; and the father, the 
brother, and the son, will have the satisfaction of wearing native or home-spun 
garments, made with cotton grown in their own gardens or plantations, and spun 
by their wives' or sisters' or daughters' hands. The Tahitian, like the Indian 
weaver, may, perhaps, at some future day, be seen fixing his rude and simple 
loom under the shadow of the cocoanut or the banana tree, whilst the objects 
that often give such a charm to rural village scenery, and awaken so many ideas 
of contentment and happy simplicity in connexion with the peasantry of England, 
may be witnessed throughout the South Sea Islands. At any rate, there is reason
&#150; 303 &#150; to hope that whatever difficulties may yet be encountered, 
the efforts made to introduce this branch of labour will be advantageous to the 
natives.<br>
<br>
 In the month of December, 1818, when the Haweis sailed from 
Huahine, on her first voyage to New South Wales, Mr. and Mrs. Orsmond left us, 
as we mutually supposed, on a visit of a few months to the island of Raiatea, 
for the purpose of receiving Mr. Threlkeld's attentions at a season of domestic 
anxiety. For two or three months contrary winds prevented any intercourse 
between us, when at length Mr. Orsmond's boat arrived, with the unexpected and 
melancholy tidings of the death of Mrs. Orsmond, which had taken place on the 
6th of January, 1819. She had survived but a few hours the birth of an infant 
daughter, by whom, in the space of five short days, she was followed to the 
eternal world, and, we believe, to the abodes of holy and unending rest. The 
disconsolate partner of her days was thus left a widower and childless, far 
from all the alleviation which the sympathies and attentions of kindred and 
friends in such seasons impart. The kindness and the sympathy of his 
fellow-labourers mitigated, however, in a great degree, the poignancy of his 
distress; and the consolations of religion supported his mind under a 
bereavement, which he had sustained in circumstances unusually distressing. The 
people around were touched with a feeling of compassion; but although their 
commiseration was fully appreciated, there was not that reciprocity of feeling 
which could lessen, if any considerable degree, the burden of his grief. In the 
family of Mr. Williams he spent the greater part of his time, when not engaged 
in public&#150; 304 &#150; duties, and experienced from its members every 
attention which kindness and attachment could bestow.<br>
<br>
 Early in 1819, 
circumstances rendered it desirable for us to visit Raiatea. We were anxious, 
also, to mingle our sympathies with those of our companions there, in that 
bereavement by which all were so deeply affected. We had been acquainted with 
Mr. and Mrs. Orsmond before leaving England. We had all left our native land 
about the same period, and had spent the greater part of our time, since 
arriving in the islands, either at the same station or under one roof, and felt 
deeply the first breach now made by death, in the little circle with which we 
were more immediately connected. We therefore availed ourselves of the return 
of Mr. Orsmond's boat, to visit the station.<br>
<br>
 About nine o'clock in 
the morning, Mr. Barff and myself, accompanied by five natives, and an English 
sailor who had charge of the boat, embarked from Huahine. Though the 
settlements were about thirty miles apart, yet, as the width of the channel was 
not much more than twenty miles, the mountains, and coast of the opposite 
island, were distinctly seen. The wind being fair, we expected to reach the 
Raiatean shore in three or four hours, and to arrive at the residence of our 
friends long before the close of day. We had not, however, been an hour at sea, 
when the heavens began to gather blackness, and lowering clouds intercepted our 
view of the shore we had left, and that to which we were bound. The wind became 
unsteady and boisterous, the sea rose, and in long heavy billows, but in short, 
cross, and broken waves. We had no compass on board.</p> 
<p>&#150; 305 &#150;</p> 
<p>The dark and heavy atmosphere obscuring the sun, prevented our discerning 
the land, and rendered us unconscious of the direction in which the storm was 
driving us. We took down our large sails, leaving only a small one in the 
forepart of the boat, merely to keep it steady.<br>
<br>
 The tempest 
increasing, the natives were alarmed, and during the occasional intervals in 
which the wind abated its violence, the rain came down in tremendous torrents. 
The rain calmed in a degree the broken and agitated surface of the ocean, that 
raged with threatening violence. Our boat being but small, not above eighteen 
feet long, and her edge, when the sea had been smooth, not more than a foot or 
eighteen inches above its surface; every wave that broke near, threw its spray 
over us, and each billow, in striking our little bark, forced part of its 
foaming waters over the bow or the sides. Happily, we had a bucket on board, by 
means of which we were able to bale out the water.<br>
<br>
 In this state we 
continued, I suppose, about two hours, hoping that the clouds would disperse, 
and the winds abate; but, instead of this, the storm seemed to increase, and 
with it our danger. Most of the natives sat down in the bottom of the boat; 
and, under the influence of fear, either shut their eyes, or covered them with 
their hands, expecting every moment that the waves would close over us. We were 
not unconscious of our peril, and, as a last resort, took down our little sail 
and our mast, tied the masts, bowsprit, and oars together in a bundle, with one 
end of a strong rope, and, fastening the other end to the bow of our boat, 
threw them into the sea. The bundle of masts, oars, &amp;c., acted as a kind of 
buoy, or floating anchor; and&#150; 306 &#150; not only broke the force of the 
billows that were rolling towards the boat, but kept it tolerable steady, while 
we were dashed on the broken wave, or wafted we knew not whither by the raging 
tempest.<br>
<br>
 The rain soon abated, and the northern horizon became 
somewhat clear, but the joyful anticipation with which we viewed this change 
was soon superseded by a new train of feelings.<i>Ure ure, tia moana</i>! 
exclaimed one of the natives; and, looking in the direction to which he 
pointed, we saw a large cylindrical waterspout, extending, like a massive 
column, from the ocean to the dark and impending clouds. It was not very 
distant, and seemed moving towards our apparently devoted boat.<br>
<br>
 The 
roughness of the sea forbade our attempting to hoist a sail in order to avoid 
it; and as we had no other means of safety at command, we endeavoured calmly to 
wait its approach. The natives abandoned themselves to despair, and either 
threw themselves along in the bottom of the boat, or sat crouching on the keel, 
with their faces downwards, and their eyes covered with their hands. The sailor 
kept at the helm, Mr. Barff sat on one side of the stern, and I on the other, 
watching the alarming object before us! While thus employed, we saw two other 
waterspouts, and subsequently a third, if not more, so that we seemed almost 
surrounded with them. Some were well defined, extending in an unbroken line 
from the sea to the sky, like pillars resting on the ocean as their basis, and 
supporting the clouds; others assuming the shape of a funnel or inverted cone, 
attached to the clouds, and extending towards the waters beneath. Form the 
distinctness&#150; 307 &#150; with which we saw them, notwithstanding the 
density of the atmosphere, the farthest could not have been many miles distant. 
In some, we imagined we could trace the spiral motion of the water as it was 
drawn to the clouds, which were every moment augmenting their portentous 
darkness. The sense, however, of personal danger, and immediate destruction, if 
brought within the vortex of their influence, restrained in a great degree all 
curious, and what, in other circumstances, would have been interesting 
observation, on the wonderful phenomena around us, the mighty agitation of the 
elements, and the terrific sublimity of these wonders of the deep.<br>
<br>
 
The roaring of the tempest, and the hollow sounds that murmured on the ear, as 
the heavy billow rolled in foam, or broke in contact with opposing billows, 
seemed as if deep called unto deep; and the noise of waterspouts might almost 
be heard, while we were momentarily expecting that the mighty waves would sweep 
over us.<br>
<br>
 I had once before, when seized with the cramp while bathing 
at a distance from my companions, been, as I supposed, on the verge of 
eternity. The danger then came upon me suddenly, and my thoughts, while in 
peril, were but few. The danger now appeared more imminent, and a watery grave 
every moment more probable; yet there was leisure afforded for reflection, and 
the sensibilities and powers of the mind were roused to an unusual state of 
excitement by the conflicting elements on every side.<br>
<br>
 A retrospect of 
life, now perhaps about to close, presented all the scenes through which I had 
passed, in rapid succession and in varied colours, each&#150; 308 &#150; 
exhibiting the lights and shades by which it has been distinguished. Present 
circumstances and connexions claimed a thought. The sorrow of the people&#151; 
the dearest objects of earthly attachment, left but a few hours before in 
health and comfort on the receding shore&#151;those unconscious infants that 
would soon, perhaps, be left fatherless, and dependent on their widowed mother, 
who, in cheerless loneliness, far from friends, and home, and country, might 
remain an exile among a race emerging from the rudest barbarism;&#151;these 
reflections awakened a train of feelings not to be described. But the most 
impressive exercise of mind was that referring to the awful change approaching. 
The struggle and the gasp, as the wearied arm should attempt to resist the 
impetuous waves, the straining vision that should linger on the last ray of 
retiring light, as the deepening veil of water would gradually conceal it for 
ever, and the rolling billows heaving over the sinking and dying body, which, 
perhaps ere life should be extinct, might become the prey of voracious 
inhabitants of the deep, caused scarcely a thought, compared with the 
appearance of the disembodied spirit in the appearance of its Maker, the 
account to be rendered, and the awful and unalterable density that would await 
it there. These momentous objects absorbed all the powers of the mind, and 
produced an intensity of feeling, which for a long time rendered me almost 
insensible to the storm, or the liquid columns which threatened our destruction.
<br> <br>
 The hours that followed were some of the most solemn I have ever 
passed in my life. Although much recurred to memory that demanded deep regret 
and most sincere repentance, yet I could &#150; 309 &#150; look back upon that 
mercy that had first brought me to a knowledge of the Saviour, with a gratitude 
never perhaps exceeded. Him, and Him alone, I found to be a refuge, a rock in 
the storm of contending feelings, on which my soul could cast the anchor of its 
hope for pardon and acceptance before God; and although not visibly present, as 
with his disciples on the sea of Tiberias, we could not but hope that He was 
spiritually present, and that, should our bodies rest till the morning of the 
resurrection in the unfathomed caverns of the ocean, our souls would be by Him 
admitted to the abodes of blessedness and rest. I could not but think how awful 
would my state have been, had I in that hour been ignorant of Christ, or had I 
neglected and despised the offers of his mercy; and while this reflection 
induced thankfulness to Him through whom alone we had been made to share a hope 
of immortality, it awakened a tender sympathy for our fellow-voyagers, who sat 
in mournful silence at the helm or in the bottom of the boat, and seemed averse 
to conversation. Our prayers were offered to Him who is a present help in every 
time of danger&#151;for ourselves&#151;and those who sailed with us; and under 
these, or similar exercises, several hours passed away. The storm continued 
during the day. At intervals we beheld, through the clouds and rain, one or 
other of the waterspouts, the whole of which appeared almost stationary, until 
at length we lost sight of them altogether, when the spirits of our native 
voyagers evidently revived.<br>
<br>
 The natives of the South Sea Islands, 
although scarcely alarmed at thunder and lightning, are at sea greatly 
terrified by the appearance of waterspouts.</p> 
<p>&#150; 310 &#150; They occur more frequently in the South than in the North 
Pacific, and although often seen among the Society Islands, are more rarely met 
with in the Sandwich group. But throughout the Pacific, waterspouts of varied 
form and size are among the most frequent of the splendid phenomena, and mighty 
works of the Lord, which those behold who go down to the sea in ships, and do 
business upon the great waters. They are sublime objects of unusual interest, 
when viewed from the shore; but when beheld at sea, especially if near, and 
from a small and fragile bark, as we had seen them, it is almost impossible so 
to divest the mind of a sense of personal danger, as to contemplate with 
composure their stately movement, or the rapid internal circular eddy of the 
waters.<br>
<br>
 Nor is it easy for an individual, who has never beheld them 
in such a situation, to realize the sensation produced, when the solitary 
voyagers, from their light canoe, or deckless boat, dancing on every undulating 
wave, descry them towering from the surface of the water, uniting the ocean and 
the heavens, while the powerful agitation of the former indicates the mighty 
process by which they are sustained. Sometimes they have approached the shore, 
and although I do not recollect any instance of their actually destroying 
persons at sea, I am inclined to presume such a calamity must have occurred, or 
they would not be such objects of terror to the people.<br>
<br>
 During our 
abode in Huahine, a number of natives were on a voyage from the Leeward to the 
Windward Islands, in a boat belonging to Mr. Williams, when a waterspout 
approached them. They had heard that, when seen by navigators, they sometimes
&#150; 311 &#150; averted the threatened danger by discharging their artillery 
at the waterspout. Having a loaded musket in the boat, they at first thought of 
firing at the advancing column; but as it approached, the agitation of the 
water was so great, and the phenomenon so appalling, that their hearts failed; 
and when it was, according to their own account, within a hundred yards of 
their boat, and advancing directly upon them, they laid the musket down. The 
man at the helm now shut his eyes, and his companions threw themselves flat on 
their faces in the bottom of the boat. This is the exact position in which a 
captive, doomed to death, awaited the fatal stroke of a victor by whom he had 
been overcome in battle. After waiting in fearful suspense several minutes, the 
helmsman, hearing a rushing noise, involuntarily opened his eyes, and saw the 
column passing, with great velocity, at a distance from the stern of boat. He 
immediately called his companions, who joined not only in watching its receding 
progress, but in acknowledging the protection of the Almighty in their 
preservation.<br>
<br>
 When returning from the Sandwich Islands on board the 
ship Russell, in 1825, we experienced a happy deliverance from one of these 
wonderful and alarming objects. Our Sabbath afternoon worship on the 
quarter-deck had just terminated; Mrs. Ellis was lying on a sofa, and, 
observing unusual indications of terror in the countenance of the boy at the 
helm, she said, &#147;What is it that alarms you?&#148; He answered, in hurried 
accents, &#147;I see a whirlwind coming,&#148; pointing to a cloud a little to 
the windward of the ship. His actions attracted the notice of the officer on 
deck, who instantly sent an able seaman to the helm, and called the&#150; 312 
&#150; captain. I had taken the books down into the cabin, and was putting them 
by, when I heard the officer, in a tone of unusual earnestness, ask the captain 
to come on deck. I hastily followed, and my attention was instantly directed to 
the waterspout.<br>
<br>
 The breeze was fresh, and as the object of alarm was 
still at some distance, it was possible we might avoid coming in contact with 
it. The captain, therefore, took in none of the sails, but called all hands on 
deck, ordered them to stand by the halyards, or ropes by which the sails are 
pulled up, so that, if necessary, they might let them go in an instant, and 
thus lower down the sails. We all marked its approach with great anxiety. The 
column was well defined, extending in an unbroken line from the sea to the 
clouds, which were neither dense nor lowering. Around the outside of the liquid 
cylinder was a kind of thick mist, and, within, a substance resembling steam, 
ascending apparently with a spiral motion. We could not perceive that much 
effect was produced on the cloud attached to the upper part of the column, but 
the water at its base was considerably agitated with a whirling motion; while 
the spray, which was thrown off from the circle formed by the lower part of the 
column, rose several feet above the level of the sea. After watching in 
breathless suspense for some time its advance in a line towards our ship, we 
had the satisfaction to see it incline in its course towards the starboard 
quarter, and ultimately pass by about a mile distant from the stern. The sail 
ropes were again fastened, and we pursued our way under the influence of 
thankfulness for the deliverance we had experienced.</p> 
<p>&#150; 313 &#150;</p> 
<p>But to return to our voyage to Raiatea: the storm, which had raged with 
violence ever since an hour after our departure from Huahine, began to abate 
towards the close of the day: we did not, however, see the land, and knew not 
whither we had drifted; but soon after the setting of the sun, the clouds 
dispersed, and a streak of light lingering in the western sky, indicated the 
direction in which we ought to proceed. The rain now ceased; the wind subsided; 
and although the surface of the sea was considerably agitated, it was no longer 
that quick dashing conflict of the waves to which we had been exposed, while 
&#147;a war of mountains raged upon its surface,&#148; but a long and heavy 
sluggish sort of motion. We pulled in our bundle of masts and oars&#151;the 
natives manned the oars, and rowed towards the west.<br>
<br>
 The moon rose 
soon after the light of the sun had departed, and although she shone not at 
first in cloudless majesty through an untroubled sky, yet the night was a 
perfect contrast to the day. The light fleecy clouds that passed over the 
surface of the sky, fringed with the moon's light, gave a pleasing animation to 
the scene, and</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>&#147;With scarce inferior lustre gleamed the sea, <br>
 Whose waves were 
spangled with phosphoric fire,<br>
 As though the lightnings there had spent 
their shafts,<br>
 And left the fragments glittering on the field.&#148;</p> 
</blockquote> 
<p>After rowing some time, we heard the hoarse roaring of the surf, as it 
broke upon the coral reef surrounding the shore. To us this was a most welcome 
sound, indicating our approach to the land. Shortly afterwards we saw a small 
island with two or three cocoa-nut trees upon it, and subsequently the coral 
reef appeared in view. We now found ourselves near the Ava Moa,&#150; 314 &#150;
 Sacred Passage, leading to Opoa, the southernmost harbour in the island of 
Raiatea; and after rowing two or three miles, landed about midnight. Weary and 
famished, drenched with the rain, and suffering much from the cold occasioned 
by the wetness of our clothes, we were truly thankful, after the incidents of 
the day, to find ourselves once again on shore. The inhabitants of the dwelling 
which we entered soon rose from their beds, kindled a large fire in the centre 
of the floor, cooked us some provisions, and furnished us with warm and clean 
native cloth, to wear while our own clothes were dried. Having refreshed 
ourselves, and united in grateful thanksgiving to the Preserver of our lives, 
we lay down upon our mats, and enjoyed several hours of refreshing repose. I 
have often been overtaken with storms when at sea in European vessels, boats, 
and native canoes, but, to whatever real danger I may have been exposed, I 
never was surrounded by so much that was apparent, as during this voyage.<br>

<br> After a few hours of unbroken rest, we arose recruited the next morning, 
found our dried clothes comfortable, united with our host and his family in the 
morning devotions, and then, while they were preparing refreshments, took a 
view of the district. We found it not very extensive, though the land is rich 
and good. The gardens were large, and, at this time, well stocked with 
indigenous roots and vegetables. Raiatea is not only the most important island 
of the Leeward group, from its central situation and its geographical extent, 
but on account of its identity, in tradition, with the origin of the people, 
and their preservation in the general deluge. It has been&#150; 315 &#150; 
distinguished as the cradle of their mythology, the birth-place and residence 
of Oro, the region to which disembodied spirits resorted, the seat of their 
oracle, and the abode of those priests whose predictions for many generations 
regulated the expectations of the nation. It is also intimately connected with 
the most important matters in the traditionary history and ancient religion of 
the people. Opoa is the most remarkable place in Raiatea; of its earth, 
according to some of their traditions, the first pair were made by Tii or 
Taaroa, and on its soil they fixed their abode, Here Oro held his court. It was 
called Hawaii; and as distant colonies are said to have proceeded from it, it 
was probably the place at which some of the first inhabitants of the South Sea 
Island arrived. It has also long been a place of celebrity, not only in 
Raiatea, but throughout the whole of the Society Islands. It was the hereditary 
land of the reigning family, and the usual residence of the king and his 
household. But the most remarkable object connected with Opoa, was the large<i>
marae</i>, or temple, where the national idol worshipped, and human victims 
were sacrificed. These offerings were not only brought from the districts of 
Raiatea and the adjacent islands, but also from the windward group, and even 
from the more distant islands to the south and south-east.<br>
<br>
 The 
worship of Oro, in the<i>marae</i> here, appears to have been of the most 
sanguinary kind; human immolation was frequent, and, in addition to the bones 
and other relics of the former sacrifices, now scattered among the ruins of the 
temple, there is still a large enclosure, the walls of which are formed 
entirely of human skulls. The horrid&#150; 316 &#150; piles of skulls, in their 
various stages of decay, exhibit a ghastly spectacle. They are principally, if 
not entirely, the skulls of those who have been slain in battle. A number of 
beautiful trees grow around, especially the<i>tamanu</i>, <i>callophyllum 
inophyllum</i>, and the <i>aoa</i>, <i>ficus prolixa</i>, resembling, in its 
growth and appearance, one of the varieties of the<i>banian</i> in India.<br>

<br> In the inland part of the district there is a celebrated pare, or natural 
fortress, frequently resorted to by the inhabitants in seasons of war; and with 
a little attention it might easily be made impregnable, at least to such forces 
or machines as the natives could bring against it.<br>
<br>
 A fine quay, or 
causeway, of coral rock, had been raised along the edge of the southern side of 
the bay, on which the natives had erected the frame of a large and substantial 
place of worship. It appeared to have remained in the state in which we saw it 
for some months past. The king and chiefs, with their numerous attendants, had 
removed to the vicinity of the Missionary station on the other side of the 
island, and the district was comparatively deserted. The frame of the building 
had been prepared with great care, several of the pillars being of polished<i>
aito</i>, or <i>casuarina</i>.<br>
<br>
 Early in the afternoon we left our 
kind friends, and enjoyed a pleasant sail within the reef, along the eastern 
shore of the island; which was remarkably broken, and beautiful in mountain 
scenery, as well as rich and verdant in the foliage with which the woody parts 
of the country were clothed. We passed between Tahaa and Raiatea, and arrived 
at the new Missionary settlement on the north-west side of the latter, about
&#150; 317 &#150; noon. Here we received a cordial welcome from our friends 
Messrs. Orsmond, Williams, and Threlkeld, who were fully occupied in their new 
sphere of labour, and attached to the people; by whom they were respected, and 
among whom they had reason to believe they were usefully employed.<br>
<br>
 
Mr. Orsmond appeared to sustain his bereavement with Christian fortitude. We 
visited the grave of the first labourer that had been called from our little 
band, and (with mingled feelings of regret at her early departure from the 
field we had unitedly cultivated, and sympathy with him whom she had left 
behind,) beheld the humble mound under which her mortal remains were reposing, 
and around which a number of indigenous and exotic flowers had been 
planted.&#151;Mr. Williams and Mr. Orsmond had for some time past preached in 
the native language. They were not only anxious to instruct the people in 
religion, but to improve their present condition by encouraging them to build 
comfortable houses after our example, and to bring under cultivation a larger 
portion of the soil than they had hitherto been accustomed to enclose. While we 
remained, we visited the different parts of the district, and called upon the 
king,&#151;whom we were delighted to find in a neat plastered house,&#151;and, 
after spending two or three days with them at Va&oacute;aara, we returned to 
Huahine.<br>
<br>
 No circumstances connected with the station at Raiatea 
afforded us more satisfaction, than the favourable appearance under which the 
education of the inhabitants had been commenced.<br>
<br>
 Next to the direct 
communication of the gospel by the living voice, the schools have been 
considered&#150; 318 &#150; as the most important department of regular 
instruction. We have always superintended the schools, and generally taught the 
higher classes. In some stations, the boys and the men have been educated in 
one school, and the women and girls in another; in others, the different sexes 
have been taught at different times; and in some, they have assembled in the 
same schools. This, however, has not been general. We have been favoured, in 
most of the stations, with valuable native teachers, in both the male and 
female schools. To this method of instruction we have looked for the perpetuity 
of the work, of which we had been privileged to witness the commencement; and 
from its influence on the rising generation, we have derived encouragement in 
reference to the stability and increase of the Christian church.<br>
<br>
 In 
the island of Huahine, we had, during the latter part of our residence there, 
two district schools, one for the males and the other for the females, which we 
found more conducive to their improvement, than the method of instructing both 
sexes in the same school. After the departure of Mr. Davies in 1820, the 
superintendence of the school had devolved entirely on Mr. Barff. The female 
school in Huahine was under the management of Mrs. Barff and Mrs. Ellis; and 
those at several of the other stations were also superintended by the wives of 
the Missionaries.<br>
<br>
 The habits of the people did not allow of their 
attending school with that regularity which scholars observe in England. Many 
of the pupils being adults, had other engagements. In order, however, to ensure 
as regular and punctual an attendance as possible, the principal instruction
&#150; 319 &#150; was given at an early hour every morning, that the people 
might attend the school before engaging in their ordinary avocations. The 
natives, therefore, assembled soon after sunrise: Mr. Barff usually repaired to 
the school for the men and boys about half past six o'clock in the morning, 
and, during the latter part of our residence in Huahine, Mrs. Barff and Mrs. 
Ellis, either unitedly or alternately, visited the female school at the same 
hour. It closed in general about eight, after which the people repaired to 
their daily employments. The boys' school was open at two o'clock in the 
afternoon, but it was principally for the instruction of children. Many of the 
adults received instruction more readily than the children, and acquired a 
knowledge of reading with much greater facility than persons of the same age 
would do in England. With many, however, more advanced in life, if was a 
difficult task; and some, after two or three years', application, were unable 
to advance beyond the alphabet, or the first syllables of the spelling-book. 
Another source of perplexity resulted from the injudicious methods of the 
native teachers, who at first, in their zeal to encourage their scholars, 
repeated to them every word in the columns of spelling, and lessons, so 
frequently, that many of their pupils could repeat from memory, perhaps, the 
whole of the book, without being able to read a single line. When they took the 
book, it was only necessary for them to be told the first word or sentence in a 
chapter, in order to their repeating the whole correctly, even though the book 
should be open at some other part, or the page be placed bottom upwards. Such 
individuals did not always like to go back to the lowest classes; yet it was 
necessary.</p> 
<p>&#150; 320 &#150; In order to convince them of the propriety of this, they 
were told we should only distribute copies of the Scriptures to those who could 
read any part on looking at it.<br>
<br>
 The native teachers had fallen into 
this practice, from the influence of former habits. All their knowledge, 
traditions, songs, &amp;c. were preserved by memory; and the preceptor recited 
them to his pupil, till the latter could repeat them correctly. The matter of 
the lessons, they also thought was the great thing to be remembered; and this, 
together with a desire to facilitate the advancement of those under their care, 
led them to adopt the method of teaching the scholars to repeat lessons without 
due attention to the words of the book. It has been, however, discontinued.<br>

<br> After the conclusion of the usual school exercises, Mr. Barff appropriated 
half an hour to the instruction of the natives in the art of singing. The 
islanders in general are fond of singing, and always ready to learn. They have 
not such sweet melodious voices as the natives of Africa have, yet learn to 
sing, considering their circumstances, remarkably well. Many of the female 
voices are clear and soft, without being weak; and they usually perform parts 
appropriated to the female voice better than the men do theirs.<br>
<br>
 
Translations of the most approved psalms and hymns, with a number that are 
original, have been prepared in the native language, in almost every variety of 
metre. To these the most popular English tunes are affixed; and with most of 
those sung by ordinary congregations in England, the natives are acquainted. 
Mr. Davies, I believe, first taught them to sing, and a tune usually called 
&#147;George's&#148; was the first they learned. On our&#150; 321 &#150; 
arrival in the islands in 1817, it was in general use; and whenever we walked 
among the habitations of the people, some parts of it broken upon the ear. It 
is now, however, very seldom heard. The &#147;Old Hundredth Psalm,&#148; 
&#147;Denmark.&#148; &#147;Sicilian Mariners,&#148; and others of a more 
moderate data, are among their greatest favourites.<br>
<br>
 The Bible has 
been the basis of the greater part of the instruction given in the schools, but 
not to the exclusion of other departments of knowledge. In addition to the 
various portions of Scripture, and numerous tracts that have been printed, a 
system of arithmetic has been prepared by Mr. Davies, and a table of 
chronology, which is extensively used; and, so soon as the entire volume of 
Scripture shall be completed, other useful works will be translated. Although a 
work on geography has not yet been printed, many of the natives have a 
tolerably correct idea of the extent, population, and relative positions of the 
most important countries of the world. They are fond of calculations, and make 
themselves familiar with figures, so far as their books enable them to proceed. 
The schools are important appendages o every Missionary station, and are 
considered such by the most intelligent and influential of the people.<br>
<br>

 As it respects the spiritual improvement of the rising generation, the 
understanding of the Scriptures, and the extension of Christianity, 
Sabbath-schools are the most interesting and encouraging sections of this 
department. The scholars are the same as in the day-schools, but the mode of 
instruction pursued is different. Writing, reading, and spelling are not 
taught, but the time is devoted to the religious instruction of the children. 
Each class is under the care of a native instructor,&#150; 322 &#150; and we 
have in several of the stations been highly favoured in the co-operation of 
valuable Sabbath-school teachers. In Huahine we found able assistants among 
them, especially the teachers in the girls' school. They were not satisfied 
with attending during the hours of school, and merely imparting the ordinary 
instruction, or hearing the usual recitals, but identified themselves with the 
advancement of the children, and exercised an affectionate care over them 
during the intervals between the Sabbaths.<br>
<br>
 By this means they gained 
the confidence and love of many of their pupils, and were resorted to for 
guidance and counsel in every engagement of importance or difficulty. 
Frequently one of these teachers, in order to greater quietude, and more 
unreserved converse with the children, would take her little class to some 
retired spot in one of the valleys behind the settlement, for the purpose of 
talking in the most affectionate manner to each individually, and then uniting 
with them in prayer to the Most High. I cannot imagine a more cheering and 
affecting scene, than must often have been presented, when a native 
Sabbath-school teacher has seated herself on the grass, under the shade of a 
spreading tree, or by the side of a winding stream, and has there gathered her 
little class around her, for the purpose of unfolding, and impressing on their 
tender minds, the pure and sacred precepts of inspired truth; or has, under 
these circumstances, engaged with them in prayer to that God, who is not 
confined to temples made with hands, and who regards the sincerity of those who 
call upon him, rather than the circumstances under which their petitions are 
offered. Their delightful labours in this department of instruction&#150; 323 
&#150; have not been in vain. Several children and young persons, who have 
died, have left behind them the most consoling and satisfactory evidence, that 
they had departed to be with Christ; and others have been at an early age 
admitted members of the Christian church.<br>
<br>
 The annual examinations of 
these schools are among the most exhilarating and interesting festivities now 
observed in the islands. They are usually held in the chapel, in order to 
afford accommodation to a greater number of persons than could gain admittance 
to the schools. Sometimes the adults are examined as well as the children, but, 
in general, only the latter. Their parents attend, and witness the procedure 
with great satisfaction. An entertainment and a procession usually terminate 
the exercises of the day. The change that has taken place has not rendered the 
people unsocial or melancholy, but has introduced to their families, and more 
general intercourse, a degree of cheerfulness and reasonable enjoyment unknown 
before, especially in reference to the rising generation.<br>
<br>
 One of 
these anniversaries, held at Burder's Point, the Missionary station in the 
district of Atehuru, in the year 1824, was unusually interesting. This district 
had formerly been distinguished for the turbulent and warlike dispositions of 
its inhabitants, and the ardour of their zeal in the service of their 
idols&#151;the magnitude of the idol temples&#151;the sanguinary character of 
their worship&#151;and the presence of Oro, the war-god of the South Sea 
Islanders. Within the precincts of the Missionary station, not far from the 
place of worship, one of the great national<i>maraes</i> formerly 
stood,&#151;where the image of Oro had often&#150; 324 &#150; been kept, where 
human sacrifices were offered, where the inauguration of the last heathen king 
who reigned in Tahiti took place, and where every cruelty and every abomination 
connected with paganism had been practised for ages. After the subversion of 
idolatry, this<i>marae</i> was divested of its glory, stripped of all its 
idolatrous appendages, and robbed of its gods, while the houses they occupied 
were committed to the flames. Still the massy pile of solid stonework, 
constituting one end of the area which the<i>marae</i> included, remained in a 
state of partial dilapidation&#151;an imposing monument of the<i>hau riaria,</i>
 reign of error, as they denominated idolatry. The natives where, however, 
determined to remove even this vestige of the system of which they so long had 
been the vassals, and therefore levelled, for this occasion, the extensive 
pile, and with the materials formed a spacious solid platform, measuring three 
feet high, one hundred and ninety-four feet long, and one hundred and 
fifty-seven feet wide; the whole surrounded with a stone wall cemented with 
lime. Here a festival was held on the 11th of June, 1824. Upon this platform 
ninety tables were prepared, after the manner of preparation for a feast in 
England. Seats, usually native-made sofas or chairs, were arranged along the 
sides of the tables, and all the children in the school, about two hundred and 
forty, dined together.<br>
<br>
 The Missionaries, and many of the parents of 
the children, were present&#151;delighted to witness the cheerfulness of the 
boys and the girls, as they sat together, and unitedly partook of the bounties 
of Providence. Mr. Darling, the indefatigable Missionary of the station, 
remarks, &#147;This was on&#150; 325 &#150; the very spot where Satan's throne 
stood, and where, a few years ago, if a female had eaten but a mouthful, so 
sacred was the place considered, that she would have been put to death.&#148; 
What a spectacle of loveliness and peace must the platform have on this day 
exhibited, when compared with the scenes of abomination, absurdity, and 
cruelty, that had often been presented, when the very materials of which it was 
composed had formed part of an idolatrous temple. The children afterwards 
walked in procession through the settlement, halted at each of the extremities, 
sung a hymn, and then repaired to the chapel, where a suitable address was 
delivered to them by the pastor. These annual examinations and festivals are 
not peculiar to Bunaau&iuml;a, but are instituted in several other stations of 
the Georgian group.<br>
<br>
 In the Leeward of Society Islands the remembrance 
of these exercises are among the most pleasing recollections I retain of my 
intercourse with the people. In Huahine they are usually held at the close of 
the public services connected with the Missionary anniversaries.<br>
<br>
 On 
the 11th of May 1821, a large chapel was nearly filled with spectators. The 
school contained four or five hundred children. Several from each class were 
examined, and manifested that they had been neither indolent nor careless. I 
beheld, with no common interest, a number of fine, healthy, and 
sprightly-looking children on that occasion assembled together, and saw a 
little boy, seven or eight years of age, with a little fringed mat wound round 
his waist, and a light scarf thrown over the shoulder, stand upon a form, and 
repeat aloud two or three chapters of one of&#150; 326 &#150; the Gospels, 
answer a variety of questions, and pass through the whole of his examination 
with scarcely a single mistake. This was the case with several on that 
occasion. At the close of the examination, the children were rewarded by Mr. 
Barff, who, on delivering the presents, which were different books in the 
native language, accompanied each by a suitable remark to the favoured 
proprietor. Often, as the little boy has walked back to the seat with his 
prize&#151;perhaps a copy of one of the Gospels&#151;I have seen the mother's 
eye follow the child with all a parent's emotion beaming in her eye, while the 
tear of pleasure has sparkled there; and, in striking contrast with this, the 
childless mother might be seen weeping at the recollection of the infants, 
which, under the influence of idolatry, she had destroyed &#150; and which, but 
for her own murderous hands, might have mingled in the throng she then beheld 
before her. On the occasion above alluded to, when the examinations in the 
place of worship had terminated, the children walked, in the same order in 
which they were accustomed to proceed from the school to the chapel, to a 
rising ground in the vicinity of the governor's house. Here an entertainment 
had been provided for them by the chiefs. We followed, amid the multitude of 
their parents and friends; and, on reaching the place of assemblage, beheld 
about three hundred boys sitting in classes on the grass on the right-hand side 
of the rising ground, each teacher presiding at the head of his class. On the 
left-hand, about two hundred girls were arranged in the same manner. A 
plentiful repast had been prepared, which was carved, and handed to them as 
they sat upon the green turf. In the&#150; 327 &#150; centre, tables were 
spread for the chiefs, and the parents and friends of the children: we sat down 
with them, gratified with their hospitality, but deriving far more pleasure 
from gazing on the spectacle on either side, than in partaking of the 
provision. Before the assembly departed, I gave a short address to the parents, 
teachers, and children. When I concluded, they all stoop up; the boys formed a 
circle on one side, and the girls on the other, and sang alternately the verses 
of a hymn in the native language; after which, one of the teachers offered a 
short prayer,&#151;and we retired, under the influence of emotions of 
satisfaction; but it was not easy to say whether joy was most powerfully 
exhibited in the countenances of the children or their parents.<br>
<br>
 
Towards the evening of the day, the children walked two and two, hand in hand, 
from one end of the settlement to the other, preceded by the flag belonging to 
the schools. The best boy in school carried the flag; which was not of silk 
emblazoned with letters of gold, but of less costly materials. The banners of 
the schools attached to the different stations were various; some of white 
native cloth, with the word &#147;Hosanna&#148; impressed upon it in scarlet 
dye; another was of light, but woven cloth, with the following sentiment 
inscribed upon it,<i>Ia ora te hui arii e ia maoro teienei hau</i>, &#147;Life 
and blessing to the Reigning Family, and long be this peaceful reign!&#148; The 
one at Huahine was of blue cloth, with a white dove and olive branch in the 
centre, beneath which was inscribed the Angels' Song, as the motto of the 
school.47 Sometimes the children, as they passed along, would sing, &#150; 328 
&#150; &#147;Long be this peaceful reign,&#148; or any other motto that might 
be inscribed upon the banner. And when they walked through the district, a 
father or mother, or both, have been seen coming from the door of their 
cottages, gazing with pleasure on them as they passed by, walking beside them, 
or following them with their eye until some clump of trees, or winding in the 
road, hid them from their view.<br>
<br>
 The meeting at Raiatea in the year 
1824 was deeply affecting. It was held on a kind of pier or quay built in the 
sea. Six hundred children assembled to partake of the feast their parents had 
provided. The boys afterwards delivered public addresses. A religious service 
in the chapel closed the exercises of the day, and all retired to their 
respective homes, apparently delighted. Mr. Williams, in reference to this 
interesting spectacle, questions whether, but for the influence of 
Christianity, one-third of the children would have been in existence, and 
states his opinion, that they would not, and that &#147;the hands of their 
mothers would have been imbrued in their blood.&#148; This was not a groundless 
opinion, but an inference authorized by the most melancholy but unquestionable 
facts. At a former meeting held on the spot where the chapel stood, in which 
the children were examined, he was present. A venerable chief rose, and 
addressed the assembly, with impressive action, and strongly excited feeling. 
Comparing the past with the present state of the people, he said, &#147;I was a 
mighty chief; the spot on which we are now assembled was by me made sacred for 
myself and family; large was my family, but I alone remain; all have died in 
the service of Satan&#151;they knew not this good word&#150; 329 &#150; which I 
am spared to see; my heart is longing for them, and often says within me, Oh ! 
that they had not died so soon: great are my crimes; I am the father of 
nineteen children; all of them I have murdered&#151;now my heart longs for 
them. &#151;Had they been spared, they would have been men and 
women&#151;learning and knowing the word of the true God. But while I was thus 
destroying them, no one, not even my own cousin, (pointing to Tamatoa the king, 
who presided at the meeting,) stayed my hand, or said, Spare them. No one said, 
The good word, the true word is coming, spare your children; and now my heart 
is repenting&#151;is weeping for them!&#148;</p>

<br>
 During the first years of our 
establishment in Huahine, frequent voyages to the adjacent islands were 
necessary; and, early in 1819, circumstances rendered it expedient that we 
should revisit Raiatea. As we expected to be absent for several weeks, Mrs. 
Barff and Mrs. Ellis accompanied us; Mr. Orsmond, who had visited Huahine, was 
returning to his station, and we embarked in his boat, although it was scarcely 
large enough to contain our party and half a dozen native rowers. The morning 
on which we sailed was fine; the sea gently rippled with the freshening breeze, 
which was fair and steady, without being violent. Our voyage was pleasant; and 
soon after two in the afternoon of the same day, we entered an opening in the 
reef, a few miles to the northward of that leading to Opoa. This entrance is 
called by the &#150; 331 &#150; inhabitants Tipae mau, True, or permanent, 
landing (place.)<br>
<br>
 We landed on one of the small islets which define, 
shelter, and adorn the entrance to the harbour, partook of some refreshment 
under the shade the brushwood afforded, while our boat's crew climbed the 
trees, and afterwards made an agreeable repast on the nuts which they gathered. 
We planted, as memorials of our visit, the seeds of some large oranges, which 
we had brought with us; then launched our boat, and prosecuted our voyage 
within the reef towards the settlement on the other side of the island. This 
part of our voyage, for twelve or fourteen miles, was delightful. The beauty of 
the wooded or rocky shores now appeared more rich and varied than before; the 
stillness of the smooth waters around was only occasionally disturbed by the 
passage of a light nautilus-like canoe, with its little sail of white native 
cloth, or the rapid flight of a shoal of flying-fish, which, when the dashing 
of our oars or the progress of our boat intercepted their course or awakened 
their alarm, sprang from their native element, and darted along, three or four 
feet above the water.<br>
<br>
 Ioretea, the Ulitea of Captain Cook, or, as it 
is now more frequently called by the natives, Raiatea, is the largest of the 
Society Islands. Its form is somewhat triangular, and its circumference about 
fifty miles. The mountains are more stupendous and lofty than those of Huahine, 
and in some parts equally broken and picturesque. The northern and western 
sides are romantic; several pyramidal and conical mountains rising above the 
elevated and broken range, that stretches along in a direction nearly parallel 
with the&#150; 332 &#150; coast, and from one to three miles distant from the 
sea. Though the shore is generally a gradual and waving ascent from the water's 
edge to the mountain, it is frequently rocky and broken. At Mahapoto, about 
half way between Opoa, the site of their principal temple, the ancient 
residence of the reigning family, and Utumaoro at the north-east angle of the 
island, there is a deep indentation in the coast. The rocks rise nearly 
perpendicular in some places on both sides, and the smooth surface of the ocean 
extends a mile and a half, or two miles, towards the mountains. The shores of 
this sequestered bay are covered with sand, shells, and broken coral. At the 
openings of several of the little glens which surround it, the cottages of the 
natives are seen through the luxuriant foliage of the<i>pandanus</i>, or the <i>
purau</i>; while the cultivated plantations in various parts extend from the 
margin of the sea to the foot of the mountains. The rivers that flow along 
their rocky courses from the head of the ravines to the ocean below&#151;and 
the distant mountains, that rise in the interior&#151;combine to form, though 
on a limited scale, rich, romantic, and beautiful landscapes. The islands in 
general are well supplied with water. The mountains are sufficiently elevated 
to intercept the clouds that are wafted by the trade-winds over the Pacific; 
being clothed with verdure to their very summits, while they attract the 
moisture, they also prevent its evaporation. Most of the rivers or streams rise 
in the mountainous parts, and though, from the peculiar structure of these 
parts, and the circumscribed extent of the islands, the distance from their 
source to their union with the sea is short; yet the body of water is often 
&#150; 333 &#150; considerable, and the uneven ground through which they have 
cut their way, the rocky projections that frequently divide the streams, and 
the falls that occur between the interior and the shore, cause the rivers to 
impart a charming freshness, vivacity, and splendour to the inland scenery.<br>

<br> Next to Tahiti, Raiatea perhaps is better supplied with rivers, or streams 
of excellent water, than any other island of the group. Its lowland is 
extensive, and the valleys, capable of the highest cultivation, are spacious, 
and conveniently situated for affording to the inhabitants intercourse with 
other parts of the island. On the north-west is a small but very secure 
harbour, called Hamaniino. Most of the ships formerly visiting Raiatea anchored 
in this convenient and sequestered harbour. Such vessels usually entered the 
reefs that surround the two islands, either at the opening called Teavapiti, a 
little to the southward of Utumaora, or at that denominated Tomahahotu, 
opposite the south end of the island of Tahaa. They then proceeded within the 
reefs along the channel between the islands, to the harbour.<br>
<br>
 Water 
and wood were at all times procured with facility from the adjacent shore; and 
supplies of stock, poultry, and vegetables might generally be obtained by 
barter with the inhabitants. The mountains of the interior sheltered the bay 
from the strong eastern and southerly winds; and the wide opening in the reef, 
opposite the mouth of the valley forming the head of the bay, favoured the 
departure of vessels with the ordinary winds. A small and partially wooded 
island on the north side of the opening in the reefs opposite the harbour, 
distinctly points out the passage, and is very&#150; 334 &#150; serviceable to 
ships going to sea. A few miles beyond the harbour of Hamaniino, Va&oacute;aara 
is situated, which was the former Missionary station, the residence of the 
chiefs, and principal part of the population. There are two open bays on the 
east side of the island, Opoa and Utumaoro. They were occasionally visited by 
shipping; and the latter has, since the removal of the Missionary station, 
become the general place of anchorage. But although they are secured from heavy 
waves by the reefs of coral that stretch along the eastern shore, they are 
exposed to the prevailing winds, excepting so far as they are sheltered by the 
islands at the entrance from the sea.<br>
<br>
 There are no lakes in Raiatea 
or Tahaa, but both islands are encircled in one reef, which is in some parts 
attached to their shores, and in others rises to the water's edge, at the 
distance of two or three miles from it. The water within the reefs is as smooth 
as the surface of a lake in a pleasure-ground, though often from eighteen to 
thirty fathoms deep. The coral reefs form natural and beautiful breakwaters, 
preserving the lowland and the yielding soil of the adjacent shore from the 
force and encroachment of the heavy billows of the ocean. Numbers of verdant 
little islands, situated like those of Tipaemau, at the openings in the reef, 
are remarkably useful as sea-marks, and furnish convenient temporary residences 
for the fishermen, who resort to them during the season for taking the<i>operu
</i>, <i>scomber scomber</i> of Linneus, and other fish, periodically visiting 
their shores. Here they dry and repair their nets while watching the approach 
of the shoals, and find them remarkably advantageous in prosecuting the most 
important of their fisheries.</p> 
<p>&#150; 335 &#150;</p> 
<p>The sun had nearly set when we reached the settlement at Va&oacute;aara. As 
we approached the shore, crowds of the natives, who had recognized some of our 
party, came off to meet us, wading into the sea above their waist, in order to 
welcome our arrival. While gazing on the motley group that surrounded our boat, 
or thronged the adjacent shore, and exchanging our salutations with those 
nearest us, before we were aware of their design, upwards of twenty stout men 
actually lifted our boat out of the water, and raised it on their shoulders, 
carrying us, thus elevated in the air, amid the shouts of the bearers, and the 
acclamations of the multitude on the shore, first to the beach, and then to the 
large court-yard in front of the king's house, where, after experiencing no 
small apprehension from this unusual mode of conveyance, we were set down safe 
and dry upon the pavement. Here we experienced a hearty welcome from the chiefs 
and people. Their salutations were cordial, though unaccompanied by the 
observances that were formerly regarded as indispensable. Considering the 
islanders as an uncivilized people, they seem to have been remarkably 
ceremonious. This peculiarity appears to have accompanied them to the temples, 
to have distinguished the homage and the service they rendered to their gods, 
to have marked their affairs of state, and the carriage of the people towards 
their rulers, to have pervaded the whole of their social intercourse, and to 
have been mingled with their diversified amusements. Their salutations were 
often exceedingly ceremonious. When a chieftain from another island, or from 
any distant part, arrived, he seldom proceeded at once to the shore, but 
usually landed, in the first instance, on some of the small&#150; 336 &#150; 
islands near. The king often attended in person, to welcome his guest, or, if 
unable to do this himself, sent one of his principal chiefs.<br>
<br>
 When the 
canoes of the visitor approached the shore, the chiefs assembled on the beach. 
Long orations were pronounced by both parties before the guests stepped on the 
soil: as soon as they were landed, a kind of circle was formed by the people; 
the king or chiefs on the one side, and the strangers on the other; the latter 
brought their<i>marotai</i>, or offering, to the king and the gods, and 
accompanied its presentation with an address, expressive of the friendship 
existing between them: the priest, or orators of the king, then brought the 
presents, or<i>manufaiti</i>, bird of recognition. On some occasions, two young 
plantain-trees and two pigs, or other articles of value, were first presented 
by the strangers, one for<i>te atua</i>, the god; the other for <i>te hoa</i>, 
the friend. A plantain-tree and a pig were brought by the residents for the 
king, a similar offering for the god; this was followed by a plantain and a 
pig, for the<i>toe moe</i>, perhaps sleeping hatchet. A plantain-tree and a dog 
were then brought for the<i>taura</i>, the cord or bond of union, and then a 
plantain and a pig for the friend.48</p> 
<p>In some of their ceremonies, a plantain-tree was substituted for a man, and 
in the first plantain-trees offered in this ceremony to the god and the friend, 
they might perhaps be so regarded. Considerable ceremony attended the reception 
of a company of Areois. When they approached a village or district, the 
inhabitants came out of their doors, and, greeting them, shouted Manava, 
Manava, long before they reached the place. They usually answered,<i>Teie</i>, 
&#147;Here,&#148; and so proceeded&#150; 337 &#150; to the rendezvous 
appointed, where a present was given to the king, and a similar offering to the 
god.<br>
<br>
 Our mode of saluting by merely shaking hands, they consider 
remarkably cold and formal. They usually fell upon each others necks, and<i>
tauahi</i>, or embraced each other, and saluted by touching or rubbing noses. 
This appears to be the common mode of welcoming a friend, practised by all the 
inhabitants of the Pacific. It also prevails among the natives of Madagascar. 
During my visit to New Zealand, I was several times greeted in this manner by 
chiefs, whose tataued countenances, and ferocious appearance, were but little 
adapted to predispose for so close a contact. This method of saluting is called 
by the New Zealanders Ho-goi, Honi by the Sandwich Islanders, and Hoi by the 
Tahitians. In connexion with this, the custom of cutting themselves with 
sharks' teeth, and indulging in loud wailing, was a singular method of 
receiving a friend, or testifying gladness at his arrival; it was, however, 
very general when Europeans first arrived.<br>
<br>
 In the court-yard of the 
king we were met by our friends Messrs. Williams and Threlkeld, in whose 
society we spent about fourteen days, and who, considering the short time they 
had been among the people, had been the means of producing an astonishing 
change, not only in their habits and appearance, but even in the natural face 
of the district. A carpenter's shop had been erected, the forge was daily 
worked by the natives, neat cottages were rising in several directions, and a 
large place of worship was building. The wilderness around was cleared to a 
considerable extent; the inhabitants of other parts were repairing to 
Va&oacute;aara, and erecting their habitations, that they&#150; 338 &#150; 
might reap the advantage of instruction. A large school was in daily operation, 
and a numerous and attentive congregation met for public worship in the native 
chapel every Sabbath. Having adjusted our public arrangements, we returned to 
Huahine on the Haweis, in which Messrs. Barff, Williams, and myself, proceeded 
to Tahiti.<br>
<br>
 The change which had taken place in Tahiti and Eimeo, in 
consequence of the abolition of idol worship, had been exceedingly gratifying, 
as it regarded the general conduct of the people, their professed belief in the 
truth of revelation, and their desire to regulate their lives by its 
injunctions; but the visible change which resulted from the establishment of 
the Missions in Huahine and Raiatea, was more striking, and did not fail to 
attract the notice, and command the approbation, of the most superficial 
observer.<br>
<br>
 We did not deem what is usually termed civilisation 
essential to their receiving the forgiveness of sin, enjoying the favour of 
God, exercising faith in Christ, and being after death admitted to the heavenly 
state; yet we considered an improvement of their circumstances, and a change in 
their occupations, necessary to their consistent profession of Christianity, 
and the best means of counteracting that inveterate love of indolence to which 
from infancy they had been accustomed. Habits of application were also 
essential to the cultivation of intellect, the increase of knowledge, and 
enjoyment in the present life. This was peculiarly desirable in reference to 
the rising generation, who were to be the future population, and who would 
arrive at years of maturity under circumstances and principles as opposite as 
light and darkness to those under which their parents had&#150; 339 &#150; been 
reared. Under these impressions, those who were stationed in the Leeward 
Islands, next to religious instruction, directed their attention to the 
promotion of industry among the people and the improvement of their temporal 
condition. We had already persuaded them to extend the culture of the soil 
beyond the growth of the articles necessary for their support during the season 
when the bread-fruit yielded no supply, and to raise cotton and productions, 
which they might exchange for clothing, tools, &amp;c. We now directed them to 
the improvement of their dwellings, which, generally speaking, were temporary 
sheds, or wide unpartitioned buildings, by no means favourable to domestic 
comfort or Christian decency.<br>
<br>
 When we landed at Fare in Huahine, I do 
not think there were more than ten or twelve houses in the whole district. 
Four, besides those we occupied, were of considerable size, belonging to the 
chiefs; the others were mere huts. In the latter, the inmates took their food, 
and rested on their mats spread upon the floor, which, had it been simply of 
earth, would have been comparatively clean and comfortable. The temporary roof 
of thatch was often pervious to the rays of the sun, and the drops of the 
frequently descending shower. In these cabins, parents, children, dogs, and 
frequently pigs and fowls, passed the night, and the greater part of the day. 
The houses of the chiefs were better built, and more capacious; the roofs 
generally impervious, and the sides frequently enclosed with straight white 
poles of the hibiscus tree. Their interior, however, was but little adapted to 
promote domestic comfort. The earthen floor was usually covered with long 
grass. This&#150; 340 &#150; by being repeatedly trodden under foot, became 
dry, broken, and filled with dust, furnishing also a resort for vermin, which 
generally swarmed the floors in such numbers, as to become intolerable. In 
these houses the people took their meals, sitting in circles on the 
grass-spread floor. Here, the fresh water used in washing their hands, the 
cocoanut water which was their frequent beverage, and the sea-water in which 
they dipped their food, was often spilt. Moisture induced decay, and although 
over these parts of the floor they often spread a little fresh grass, yet many 
places in the native houses frequently resembled a stable, or a stable-yard, 
more than a suitable dwelling-place for human beings.<br>
<br>
 In the drier 
parts of the house, along each side, the inmates slept at night. However large 
the building might be, there were no partitions or skreens. Some of their 
houses were two hundred feet long; and on the floor, hundreds have, at times, 
lain down promiscuously to sleep. They slept on mats manufactured with 
palm-leaves, spread on the ground. These mats were generally rolled up like a 
sailor's hammock in the morning, and spread out at night. The chief and his 
wife usually slept at one end of the house, without the least partition between 
them and the other inmates of their dwelling. Instead of a single mat, three or 
four, or even ten, were sometimes spread one upon the other, to give elevation 
and softness; and this, with the finer texture of the mats, was the only 
difference between the bed of the chief, and that on which the meanest of his 
dependents slept. Instead of being spread on the floor, the mats were sometimes 
spread on a low bedstead, raised nine or twelve inches above the floor. The 
sides and bottom of this bedstead were made&#150; 341 &#150; with the boards of 
the bread-fruit tree. Next to the chief, the members of his own family spread 
their mats on the floor, and then the friends and attendants&#151;the females 
nearest the chief, the men towards the opposite end of the building.<br>
<br>
 
I have sometimes entered the large houses in Huahine, soon after our arrival 
there, and have seen, I think, forty, fifty, or sixty sleeping places of this 
kind, in one house, consisting of a mat spread on the ground, a wooden pillow 
or bolster in the shape of a low stool, next the side or wall, and a large 
thick piece of cloth, like a counterpane or shawl, which they call<i>ahu taoto
</i>, sleeping-cloth, and which is their only covering, lying in the middle of 
each mat. There was no division or skreen between the sleeping places, but the 
whole ranged along in parallel lines from one end of the house to the other. 
What the state of morals must necessarily have been among such a community, it 
is unnecessary to shew; yet such were the modes of life that prevailed among 
many, even after they had renounced idolatry. Such we found society in Huahine, 
and such our friends in Raiatea found it there. One of the reasons which they 
gave why so many slept in a house, was, their constant apprehensions of evil 
spirits, which were supposed to wander about at night, and grasp or strangle 
the objects of their displeasure, if found alone. Great numbers passing the 
night under the same roof, removed this fear, and inspired a confidence of 
security from the attacks their idolatrous absurdities led them to expect.<br>

<br> The evils necessarily resulting from these habits were too palpable to 
allow us to delay attempting an alteration. We recommended each family to build 
distinct and comfortable cottages for themselves,&#150; 342 &#150; and the 
chiefs to partition bed-rooms in their present dwellings, in which they must 
reside while building others; even in these we recommended them to reduce the 
number of their inmates, and to erect distinct sleeping rooms for those they 
retained.<br>
<br>
 We were happy to perceive on their part a willingness to 
follow our advice. The first native improvement was made by Mai, the chief of 
Borabora, residing at that time at Fare in Huahine; and we believe this was at 
the request of his daughter. He directed his servants to clear out all the 
grass from the floor of the house he occupied; they then levelled the earth, 
procured lime, and plastered it over nearly an inch thick with mortar; this 
hardened, and formed an excellent, solid, durable, and clean floor. With this 
material we had made the floors of our own temporary dwellings, in which we had 
erected slight partitions of poles, covered with thick native cloth, to 
separate the different apartments from each other. In this also we soon 
perceived the chiefs promptly following our example. At the same time we 
commenced the erection of permanent places of residence for ourselves, and 
spared no pains to induce the people to do the same. Our first effort was to 
build a lime-kiln, on which we bestowed considerable labour, though it did not 
ultimately answer. The natives prepared their lime by burning it in a large 
pit, in a manner resembling that in which they had prepared their ovens for 
opio. This was done with greater facility than they could burn it in the kiln 
they had built, though with less economy in fuel.<br>
<br>
 Specimens of 
fibrous limestone, and small fragments of calcareous rock, have been 
occasionally&#150; 343 &#150; found in some of the islands, but not in quantity 
or kind to be available in the preparation of lime for building. Shells might 
be procured in tolerable abundance; but the white coral rock, of which the 
extensive reefs surrounding these islands are composed, and which appears 
inexhaustible, is used in the manufacture of lime.<br>
<br>
 The natives dive 
into the sea, sometimes several fathoms deep, in order to procure the solid or 
sponge-shaped coral, which for this purpose is better than the forked or 
branching kinds. They also prefer that which is attached to the main reef, and 
growing, or as they sometimes call it, live coral, to that which is broken off 
and hardened or dead. The large fragments or blocks of coral, sometimes three 
or four feet in diameter, are conveyed on rafts to the shore, where they are 
broken into small pieces. A capacious hole is then dug, wherein fuel in immense 
logs is piled up till it assumes the appearance of a mound four or five feet 
high. On the outside of this, the pieces of coral are placed, twelve or 
eighteen inches thick. The pile is then kindled, the fuel consumed, and the 
lime, thus burnt, sinks into the pit. They are generally so impatient to see 
whether it is well burnt, that they throw water upon it often before the fire 
is extinct; and if they find it crumble and become pulverized, they cover it 
over with cocoanut leaves, and use it as occasion requires.<br>
<br>
 The coral 
rock makes excellent lime, not perhaps so strong as that made from 
rock-limestone, but fine, beautifully white, and durable. It may be obtained in 
any quantity, but the labour of procuring the fuel necessary for preparing it 
on the present plan, is exceedingly irksome. Could they be induced to erect 
kilns, and burn it after the&#150; 344 &#150; European manner, it might be 
furnished with great facility, and the fact of their being able to prepare with 
little trouble, lime from the coral rock, would encourage them in building 
comfortable houses.<br>
<br>
 Our friends in Raiatea were perhaps more urgent 
than ourselves, in their recommendation of improved dwellings. On our first 
visit to Raiatea, in January 1819, the servants of Tamatoa, the king of that 
island, were plastering a house for his residence: it was nearly finished; the 
outside was completed, and they were at work within. A day or two after our 
return to Huahine, we were delighted to see one in the district of Fare 
actually finished. It was smaller than Tamatoa's, and differently shaped, his 
being oval, and this being nearly square, with high gable-ends. It belonged to 
an ingenious and industrious young man, whose name was Navenavehia, and who, 
although an inferior chief in Huahine, had accompanied Mahine to Eimeo, where 
he had resided in the family of Mr. George Bicknell, by whom he had been taught 
the use of tools, and the art of burning lime. It is not easy, nor is it 
material, to determine which of these two houses was finished first. They were 
certainly both in hand at the same time, and the periods of their completion 
were probably not very remote from each other. A new order of architecture was 
thus introduced to the nation, and the names of Tamatoa, king of Raiatea, and 
of Navenavehia, the more humble chief in Huahine, ought not to be forgotten, in 
connexion with the introduction of a style of building which has since 
prevailed extensively among the people, augmenting their social and domestic 
comforts, changing the appearance of their villages, and improving the 
beautiful scenery of their islands.</p> 
<p>&#150; 345 &#150; These two houses were not only the first in the Leeward 
group, but they were the first of the kind ever erected, for their own abode, 
by any of the natives of the South Sea Islands.<br>
<br>
 The success of these 
individuals encouraged others, although we found great difficulty in persuading 
them to persevere in the labour this improvement required, particularly as they 
were now employed in the erection of a spacious chapel, and the frames of our 
dwellings. It was no easy task for them to build houses of this kind; there 
were no regular carpenters and masons. Every man had, in the first place, to go 
to the woods or the mountains, and cut down trees for timber, shape them into 
posts, &amp;c. and remove them to the spot where his house was to be built, 
then to erect the frame, with the doorway and windows. This being done, he must 
again repair to the woods for long branches of hibiscus for rafters, with which 
he framed the roof.<br>
<br>
 The leaves of the <i>pandanus</i> were next 
gathered, and soaked, and sewed on reeds, with which the roof was thatched. 
This formerly would have completed his dwelling, but he now had to collect, 
with great labour, a large pile of firewood, to dig a pit, to dive into the sea 
for coral rock, to burn it, to mix it with sand so as to form mortar, wattle 
the walls and partitions of his house, and plaster them with lime. He then had 
to ascend the mountains again, for trees, which he must either split or saw 
into boards for flooring his apartments, manufacturing doors, windows, 
shutters, &amp;c. This was certainly a great addition of labour; and hence many 
occupy their cottages as soon as they have finished the roof, the walls, and 
the door&#151;levelling the ground for the floor, and spreading&#150; 346 &#150;
 grass over it&#151;occupying one part, while they board or plaster the other.
<br> <br>
 In this state we found Navenavehia's house, when we paid him our 
first visit. We recommended him to persevere in completing it, and, in order to 
encourage him, promised him nails to make doors, and whatever else was wanting. 
He assured us of his intention to board the floor, and partition off their 
bed-room; but said, he thought they might as well live in it while he was doing 
this, and therefore had occupied it as soon as the walls were dry.<br>
<br>
 
The settlements in the Leeward Islands now began to assume a new aspect. 
Multitudes flocked from the different districts, to attend the means of 
instruction in the school, and on the Sabbath. The erection of a house upon the 
improved plan, regulating its size by the rank or means of the family for whom 
it was designed, became a kind of test of sincerity in professions of desire to 
be instructed; for, to embrace Christianity, with the precepts which it 
inculcated, nothing could be more at variance than the habits of indolence and 
unsightly filthiness of their former habitations.<br>
<br>
 Activity was now 
the order of the day. Frames of buildings were seen rising, with astonishing 
rapidity, in every part of the district; and houses of every size, from the 
lowly snug little cottage with a single door and window in front, to the large 
two-storied dwelling of the king or the chief. Buildings, also, in every stage 
of their progress, might be seen in a walk through the settlement: sometimes 
only a heap of spars and timber lay on the spot where the house was to be 
raised, but at other places the principal posts of the houses were erected, 
others were thatched, and some partially&#150; 347 &#150; or entirely enclosed 
with the beautiful white coral-lime plaster. Axes, hatchets, planes, chisels, 
gimlets, and saws, were, next to their books, the articles in greatest demand 
and highest esteem.<br>
<br>
 No small portion of our time was occupied in 
directing and encouraging them in their labours. We had, however, occasion to 
regret, that we were sometimes at as great a loss as the people themselves. 
They usually formed the walls of their dwellings, either by mortising upright 
posts into large trees laid on the earth, or planting the posts in the ground 
about three feet apart. The spaces between the posts, excepting those for doors 
or windows, were filled with a kind of hurdle-work, or wattling of small rods 
or sticks, of the tough<i>casuarina</i>. This they plastered with the mortar, 
forming a plain surface, and covering also the posts on the outside, but 
leaving them projecting within.<br>
<br>
 The next object was to make the doors 
and window-shutters: thus far they had been able to proceed in the erection of 
their dwellings without nails; but to make doors and shutters without these, 
brought them at first to a stand. We were glad to furnish the chiefs and others 
with these most valuable articles, so far as our stock would allow, but it was 
useless to think of supplying the wants of the entire population; we only 
regretted that we could not have more ready access to our friends in England, 
many of whom, we had no doubt, would readily have supplied them with an article 
easily procured in abundance there, but here exceedingly scarce. Nails are 
still among the most valuable manufactures they can receive.</p> 
<p>&#150; 348 &#150;</p> 
<p>Their invention and perseverance at length overcame the difficulty, and 
they constructed their doors by fastening together three upright boards, about 
six feet long, by means of three narrow pieces across, one at each end, the 
other in the middle. These latter were fastened to the long boards by strong 
wooden pegs. What the pegs wanted in strength, they determined to supply by 
numbers, and I think I have seen upwards of fifty or sixty hard pegs driven 
through one of these cross-pieces into the boards forming the door. In order to 
prevent their dropping out when the wood shrunk by the heat, they drove small 
wedges into the ends of the pegs, which frequently kept them secure. In the 
same manner they fastened most of their floors to the sleepers underneath, 
using, however, large pegs resembling the treenails in a ship's plank, more 
than the nails in a house-floor.<br>
<br>
 When the door was made, it was 
necessary to hang it; but only a few of the chiefs were, for many years, able 
to procure iron hinges. Some substituted tough pieces of fish-skin, pieces of 
the skin of other animals, or leather procured from the ships; but these soon 
broke, and many of the natives set to work to make wooden hinges. They were 
generally large, and, when attached to a light thin door, looked remarkably 
clumsy: but they were made with great industry and care, and the joints very 
neatly fitted. A man would sometimes be a fortnight in making a single pair of 
hinges. After all, they were easily broken, and made a most unpleasant noise 
every time the door was opened or shut.<br>
<br>
 In our walks through the 
native settlements, we were often amused at the state in which we found&#150; 
349 &#150; the houses occupied by their proprietors. Some appeared with only 
the walls on the outside plastered, others with both sides plastered; some 
having their doors and window-shutters fixed, others with a low fence only 
across the door-way; some with grass spread over the whole floor, while others 
had a portion boarded sufficiently large to contain their sleeping-mats at 
night. A few, whose dwellings were completely finished, inhabited them with all 
the conscious satisfaction attending the enjoyment of what had cost them great 
and persevering labour. All confessed that the new kind of houses were better 
than the old; that when the weather was warm, they could have as much air as 
was agreeable; and when the night was cold and the wind high, or the rain 
drifting, they had not, as formerly, to rise and move their beds, or secure 
their clothing from wet, but could sleep on, sheltered from the elements 
without.<br>
<br>
 This was the state of the settlement in Huahine when visited 
by Captain Gambier, of H. M. ship Dauntless, Captain Elliot, and other naval 
officers, whom I had the pleasure of meeting there. The account of the 
settlement given by the former, and the emotions excited in his own mind by his 
visit, are so interesting, that I think it would be almost unjust to deprive 
the readers of these pages of the satisfaction his description is adapted to 
afford.<br>
<br>
 In reference to Tahiti, and the change generally, Captain 
Gambier observes, &#147;The testimony is a strong one: as I had never felt any 
interest in the labours of Missionaries, I was not only not prepossessed in 
favour of them, but I was in a measure suspicious of their reports. It will 
appear as clear as light to the spiritual mind, that the account of their 
state, and the gratification experienced&#150; 350 &#150; in the contemplation 
of it, was altogether of a temporal nature; that the progress made towards 
civilization and earthly happiness, in consequence of the moral influence of 
Christianity, was the cause of that delight. The hand of a superintending 
Providence is generally acknowledged, it is true, but it is so only with 
respect to the temporal state. So true it is, that the mind itself, untaught by 
the Divine Spirit, knows nothing of the awful and overwhelming importance of 
the eternal interests of the soul over the things of this short-lived 
scene.&#148;<br>
<br>
 In reference to Huahine, and the station now described, 
though not more forward than others in the same group, Captain Gambier 
observes: &#147;At about ten o'clock on the morning of the 20th of January, 
1822, the ship being hove-to outside the reef, a party of us proceeded towards 
the village of Fare. After passing the reef of coral which forms the harbour, 
astonishment and delight kept us silent for some moments, and was succeeded by 
a burst of unqualified approbation at the scene before us. We were in an 
excellent harbour, upon whose shores industry and comfort were plainly 
perceptible; for, in every direction, white cottages, precisely English, were 
seen peeping from amongst the rich foliage, which every where clothes the 
lowland in these islands. Upon various little elevations, beyond these, were 
others, which gave extent and animation to the whole. The point on the left, in 
going in, is low, and covered with wood, with several cottages along the shore.
49 On the right, the high land of the interior slopes down with gentle gradual 
&#150; 351 &#150; descent, and terminates in an elevated point, which just out 
into the harbour, forming two little bays. The principal and largest is to the 
left, viewing them from seaward; in this, and extending up the valley, the 
village is situated. The other, which is small, has only a few houses&#151;but 
so quiet, so retired, that it seems the abode of peace and perfect content. 
Industry flourishes here. The chiefs take a pride in building their own houses, 
which are now all after the European manner; and think meanly of themselves, if 
they do not excel the lower classes in the arts necessary for the construction. 
Their wives also surpass their inferiors in making cloth. The queen and her 
daughter-in-law, dressed in the English fashion, received us in their neat 
little cottage.</p> 
<p>&#147;The furniture of her house was all made on the island, and by the 
natives with a little instruction originally from the Missionaries. It 
consisted of sofas with backs and arms, with (cinet) bottoms, really very well 
constructed; tables and bedsteads by the same artificers. There were curtains 
to the windows, made of white cloth, with dark leaves stained upon it for a 
border, which gave a cheerful and comfortable air to the rooms. The bed-rooms 
were up stairs, and were perfectly clean and neat. These comforts they prize 
exceedingly; and such is the desire for them, that a great many cottages, after 
the same plan, are rising up every where in the village.<br>
<br>
 &#147;The 
sound of industry was music to my ears. Hammers, saws, and adzes, were heard in 
every direction. Houses in frame met the eye in all parts, in different stages 
of forwardness. Many boats, after our manner, were building, and lime burning 
for cement and whitewashing.</p> 
<p>&#150; 352 &#150;</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>&#147;Upon walking through the village, we were very much pleased to see 
that a nice, dry, elevated foot-path or causeway ran through it, which must add 
to their comfort in wet weather, when going to prayers in their European 
dresses. As we stopped occasionally to speak to some of the natives standing 
near their huts, we had frequent opportunities of observing the value they set 
upon the comforts of our English style of cotage, and other things introduced 
among them of late. They said they were ashamed to invite us into their huts, 
but that their other house was building, and then they would be happy to see us 
there.<br>
 &#147;Afterwards I walked out to the point forming the division 
between the two bays. When I had reached it, I sat down to enjoy the sensations 
created by the lovely scene before me. I cannot describe it; but it possessed 
charms independent of the beautiful scenery and rich vegetation. The blessings 
of Christianity were diffused amongst the fine people who inhabited it; a taste 
for industrious employment had taken deep root; a praiseworthy emulation to 
excel in the arts which contribute to their welfare and comfort, had seized 
upon all, and, in consequence, civilization was advancing with rapid 
strides.&#148;</p> </blockquote> 
<p>The scene described by Captain Gambier is represented in the accompanying 
engraving, which exhibits the progress of the buildings along the shore at the 
time. There is something peculiarly pleasing in watching the process which 
periodically changes the face of the natural world. The swelling bud&#151;the 
opening blossom&#151;the expanding leaves&#151;the tiny fruit-formations, as 
they regularly pass under the eye of the observer, are not less interesting 
than the bough&#150; 353 &#150; bending with ripened fruit. The process which 
effects the changes marking the progress from birth to maturity in the animal 
creation, is not less curious; and at this time we beheld a work advancing, 
which was rapidly transforming the character and habits of a nation, and 
materially altering even the aspect of the habitable portions of their country. 
This gave a peculiar interest to the nondescript sort of dwelling, half native 
hut, and half European cottage, which many of the people at this time 
inhabited. They marked the steps, and developed the process, by which they were 
rising from the rude and cheerless degradation of the one, to the elevation and 
enjoyment of the other. These sensations were often heightened by our 
beholding, in the neighbourhood of these half-finished houses, the lonely and 
comfortless hut they had abandoned, and the neatly finished cottage in which 
the inmates enjoyed a degree of comfort, that, to use their own powerful 
expression, made them sometimes ready to doubt whether they were the same 
people who had been contented to inhabit their former dwellings, surrounded by 
pigs and dogs, and swarms of vermin, while the wind blew over them, and the 
rain beat upon them.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>The greater number of houses, already erected, contain only two or three 
rooms on one floor, but several of the chiefs have built spacious, and, 
considering the materials with which they are constructed, substantial 
habitations, with two stories, and a number of rooms in each, having also some 
of the windows glazed. Mahine, the king of Huahine, was, we believe, the first 
native of the South Sea Islands, who finished a house with upper rooms. When 
done, it was quite a curiosity&#150; 354 &#150; among the natives of the 
Leeward Islands, and multitudes came on purpose to see it. It was built with 
care, and, considering it as a specimen of native workmanship, was highly 
creditable to their industry, perseverance, and ingenuity. Many of the natives, 
especially those who have been native house-builders, are tolerably good 
carpenters, and handle tools with facility. They have also been taught to saw 
trees into a number of boards, instead of splitting them into two planks, which 
was their former practice.<br>
<br>
 The stone in the northern parts of the 
island is a kind of compact ancient lava, and, though rather hard, is, we 
think, adapted for buildings. We were desirous to induce some of the chiefs to 
attempt the erection of a stone house; but they had no proper tools for 
preparing the stone, and the labour was also greater than in their present 
state of civilization they were disposed to undertake. It is not, however, 
improbable that stone buildings will ultimately supersede the neat, yet, 
compared with those erected of less perishable materials, temporary dwellings 
they are now occupying. The coral rock is also more durable than the plaster; 
and although soft, and easily hewn when first taken out of the sea, it 
afterwards assumes a degree of hardness which resists the weather for a long 
series of years. A chapel has been built with this material in the island of 
Eimeo, and it will probably last longer than any other yet erected.<br>
<br>
 
When we arrived in Eimeo, Messrs. Hayward and Bicknell were residing in boarded 
dwellings with chambers, and Mr. Nott in a house, the walls of which were 
neatly plastered. The earth in some parts of the islands would probably answer
&#150; 355 &#150; for bricks; and the Missionaries formerly made one or two 
attempts to prepare them for ovens, &amp;c. but did not succeed. Individuals 
professing to understand making bricks have once or twice offered to teach the 
natives; but much as we have wished to possess permanent brick houses for 
ourselves, or to recommend the natives to prepare such, we are convinced that 
the labour would be too great, and the failures in burning them too frequent, 
to allow at present of their being made with advantage,&#151;yet we hope they 
will follow the plastered cottage, just as that now occupies the place of the 
native hut.<br>
<br>
 The timber principally employed in their buildings, is 
the wood of the bread-fruit; and although they are careful of this valuable 
tree, it is necessary frequently to urge the duty of planting, in order to 
ensure a future supply not only of timber but of food, as the large trees are 
now comparatively few, and the population is evidently in creasing.<br>
<br>
 
In the commencement of a new settlement, or the establishment of a town, like 
that rising around us at the head of Fare harbour, we were desirous that it 
should assume something like a regular form, as it regarded the public 
buildings and habitations of the chiefs and people. We sometimes advised them 
to build their houses and form their public roads in straight lines, and to 
leave equal distances between the roads and the houses, and also between each 
dwelling. Our endeavours, however, were unavailing. They could perceive nothing 
that was either desirable or advantageous in a straight road, or regularity in 
the site, or uniformity in the size or shape, of their habitations. Every one, 
therefore, followed his own&#150; 356 &#150; inclinations. The size of the 
building was regulated by the number in the family, the rank or the means of 
its proprietor, and the shape by his fancy. It was oblong or square, with high 
gable, or circular ends covered with thatch, so that the building resembled an 
oval more than any other shape.<br>
<br>
 The situations selected were either 
parts of their own ground, or such places as accorded with their taste and 
habits. Those who were frequently upon the waters, and enjoyed the gentle 
sea-breezes, or wished to excel their neighbours, built a massy pier or 
causeway in the sea, and, raising it four or five feet above high-water mark, 
covered it with smooth flat stones, and then erected their houses upon the spot 
they had thus recovered from the sea, by which it was on three sides 
surrounded. The labour required for effecting this, prevented any but chiefs 
from building in such situations. Others, actually building upon the sand, 
erected their dwelling upon the upper edge of the beach, within four or five 
yards of the rising tide.<br>
<br>
 The public road, from six to twelve feet 
wide, which led through the district, extending in a line parallel with the 
coast, presented all its curvatures. Some of the natives built their houses 
facing the sea; others, turning their fronts towards the mountain, reared them 
within five or six feet of the road; while several, of a more retiring 
disposition, built in the centre of their plantations, or under the embowering 
shade of a grove of bread-fruit trees, enclosing them within the fence that 
surrounded their dwelling. Some of the leading chiefs, in order to enjoy a more 
extensive prospect, and to breathe a purer atmosphere, left the humility and 
shade of the lowland and the valley, and built their houses on the sides of the 
verdant hills&#150; 357 &#150; that rise immediately behind the bay, and form 
the connecting link between the rocks around the beach and the high mountains 
of the interior.<br>
<br>
 A settlement thus formed could never possess any 
approximation to uniformity; yet it frequently seemed to us as if the variety 
in size and shape among the buildings, and the irregularity of their situation, 
were in perfect keeping with the wild, untrained luxuriant loveliness, and 
romantic appearance, of the rocks, the hills, the mountains, the valleys, and 
every other natural object by which the rising settlement was surrounded. The 
chiefs vied with each other in the size, elevation, or conveniences of their 
houses: some being, like Pohuetea's and Teriitaria's, built upon a pier in the 
sea; others preparing to attach verandas, by which they could remain cool under 
a meridian sun; others erected rude covered balconies, in which they might 
enjoy a more extended prospect, be shaded from the sun, and breathe purer air. 
The rustic palm-leaf thatch, and beautifully white plastered walls, of all the 
buildings, whether standing on the sea-beach, on the mountain's side, embowered 
under the bread-fruit and cocoa-nut grove, or situated in the midst of their 
plantations, with a walk strewed with fragments of coral and shells leading 
from the road to the door, appeared in delightful contrast with the thick dark 
foliage of the trees, the perpetual luxuriance of vegetation, and the 
variegated blossoms of the native flowers.<br>
<br>
 The duration of the 
buildings was in general according to the nature of the thatch; the same house 
frequently received two or three new roofs, and if the frame was well put 
together, and the timber seasoned, a plastered cottage would probably&#150; 358 
&#150; last ten or fifteen years. Many, however, from the rude and hurried 
manner in which they were built, became dilapidated in a much shorter period.
<br> <br>
 While individuals and families were thus engaged in the erection of 
their domestic habitations, the people of the island were occupied in raising a 
spacious and substantial chapel. They commenced it in the beginning of 1819, 
and completed it early in the following year. It was one hundred feet long, and 
sixty wide. The sides were fourteen or sixteen feet high, and the centre not 
less than thirty. The walls were plastered within and without. The roof was 
covered with<i>pandanus</i> leaves, the windows closed with sliding shutters, 
and the doors hung with iron hinges of native workmanship. Altogether, the 
building was finished in a manner highly creditable to their public spirit, 
skill, and industry. All classes cheerfully united in the work, and the king of 
the island&#151;assisted by his only son, a youth about seventeen years of 
age&#151;might be seen every day directing and encouraging those employed in 
the different parts of the building, or working themselves with the plane or 
the chisel, in the midst of their chiefs and subjects.<br>
<br>
 The interior 
of the roof was remarkable for the neatness of its appearance, and the 
ingenuity of its structure. The long rafters, formed with slender cocoa-nut, 
casuarina, or hibiscus trees, were perfectly straight, and polished at the 
upper end. The lower extremities were ornamented with finely-woven variegated 
matting, or curiously braided cord, stained with brilliant red or black and 
yellow native colours, ingeniously wound round the polished wood, exhibiting a 
singularly neat and&#150; 359 &#150; chequered appearance. The ornament on the 
rafter terminated in a graceful fringe or bunch of tassels.<br>
<br>
 The 
pulpit, situated at a short distance from the northern end, was hexagonal, and 
supported by six pillars of the beautiful wood of the<i>pua</i>, which 
resembles, in its grain and colour, the finest satinwood. The panels were of 
rich yellow bread-fruit, and the frame of<i>mero</i>, a fine-grained, dark, 
chestnut-coloured wood. The stairs, reading-desk, and communion table, were all 
of deep umber-coloured bread-fruit; and the whole, as a specimen of 
workmanship, was such as the native carpenters were not ashamed of. The floor 
was boarded with thick sawn planks, or split trees; and, although it exhibited 
great variety of timber and skill, was by no means contemptible.<br>
<br>
 
According to ancient usage in the erection of public buildings, the work had 
been divided among the different chiefs of the islands; these had apportioned 
their respective allotments among their peasantry or dependants, and thus each 
party had distinct portions of the wall, the roof, and the floor. The numbers 
employed rendered these allotments but small, seldom more than three of six 
feet in length, devolving on one or two families. This, when finished, they 
considered their own part of the chapel; and near the part of the wall they had 
built, and the side of the roof they had thatched, they usually fitted up their 
sittings. The principal chiefs, however, fixed their seats near the pulpit.<br>

<br> Uniformity was as deficient in the sittings of the chapel, as in the 
houses of the town, each family fitting up their own according to their 
inclination or ability. For a considerable extent around the&#150; 360 &#150; 
pulpit, the seats were in the form of low boarded pews neatly finished. Behind 
them appeared a kind of open, or trellis-work line of pews, which were followed 
by several rows of benches with backs; and, still more remote from the pulpit, 
what might be called free or unapporpriated sittings, were solid benches or 
forms, without any support for the back or arms.<br>
<br>
 The colour and the 
kind of wood, used in the interior, was as diversified as the forms in which it 
was employed; it was, nevertheless, only when empty, that its irregularity and 
grotesque variety appeared. When well filled with respectably dressed 
worshippers, as it generally was on the Sabbath, the difference in the material 
or structure of the places they occupied, was not easily noticed.<br>
<br>
 A 
remarkably ingenious and durable low fence called by the natives<i>aumoa</i>, 
was erected round it, and the area within the enclosure was covered with small 
fragments of white branching coral, called<i>anaana</i>, and found on the 
northern shores of the day.<br>
<br>
 In the month of April, 1820, it was 
finished, and on the 3d of May opened for Divine service.<br>
<br>
 A 
distressing epidemic had raged for some time among the people, and still 
confined many to their habitations, yet there were not fewer than fifteen 
hundred present. Many of them were arrayed in light European dresses, and all 
evidently appeared to feel a high degree of satisfaction in assembling for the 
public adoration of the Almighty in a building, in many respects an object of 
astonishment through the island, and which their own toil and perseverance had 
enabled them to finish.</p> 
<p>&#150; 361 &#150;</p> 
<p>Individuals in England, who have materially contributed by personal 
exertions or pecuniary aid to the erection or enlargement of a church or 
chapel, have, when the object of their solicitude and their toil has been 
accomplished, experienced emotions of satisfaction during the subsequent 
opportunities they have had of rendering divine homage there; but the 
satisfaction of the Tahitians, though the same in kind, I am disposed to 
believe, is stronger in degree, when standing on the floor, the trees 
constituting which, they cut down in the forest&#151;when skreened from the 
wind by that portion of the wall their own hands reared, and covered by that 
section of the roof which they had thatched.<br>
<br>
 While the inhabitants of 
Huahine were thus laudably engaged in providing the means of increasing their 
domestic enjoyments, and accommodating the assemblies for public worship, their 
neighbours in the adjacent island of Raiatea were not behind them in the 
rapidity of their improvement. They had erected a number of dwelling-houses, 
and a building for divine service, larger than that at Huahine, but inferior in 
elevation and breadth; being forty-two feet wide, and at the sides about ten 
feet high. It was finished a week or two earlier than the chapel in Huahine, 
and was opened on the 11th of April in the same year; when upwards of 2,400 
inhabitants of that and the adjacent islands assembled within its walls.<br>

<br> To the natives of Raiatea, this work of their own hands appeared a 
wonderful specimen of architecture; the manner in which its interior was 
finished perfectly astonished them, and appeared no less surprising to the 
natives of the other islands. It was not only furnished with a pulpit,&#150; 
362 &#150; a desk, a boarded floor throughout, constructed of the tough planks 
of the reva, and filled with pews and seats, but, by the invention and 
ingenuity of the Missionaries, it was subsequently furnished with a rustic set 
of chandeliers.<br>
<br>
 By this contrivance it could be lighted up for an 
evening congregation, while we were under the necessity of concluding all our 
public services before the sun departed. These chandeliers, as they may perhaps 
with propriety be called, were not indeed of curious workmanship of dazzling 
brilliancy, in polished metal or cut-glass, but of far more common materials, 
and simplicity of structure. The frame was of light tough wood, and the lamps, 
instead of being coloured and transparent, were opaque cocoa-nut shells. They 
were, however, the only inventions of the kind the natives had ever seen; and 
on the night when the chapel was first illuminated by their aid, as they came 
in one after another, and saw the glare of such a number of lights suspended 
from the roof in a manner that they could not at first understand, they 
involuntarily stopped to gaze as they entered the door, and few proceeded to 
their seats without an exclamation of admiration or surprise. Their 
astonishment was probably greater than would be experienced by an English 
peasant from a retired village, on beholding, for the first time, a spacious 
public building splendidly lighted up with gas.<br>
<br>
 Although we were 
pleased with the effect produced on the minds of the natives, and a thousand 
delightful associations revived in our bosoms the first time we mingled with a 
crowded evening congregation, we did not recommend our people to follow the 
example their ingenious neighbours had&#150; 363 &#150; set them. It appeared 
more desirable, in the partially organized state of society then prevailing in 
the islands, to conclude all our public meetings by daylight, rather than call 
the people from home after sunset.</p>

<br>
 As soon as the new building in Huahine was 
finished, and appropriated to the sacred use for which it had been reared, the 
original chapel was converted into a school, and was scarcely sufficient to 
accommodate the increasing number of scholars.<br>
<br>
 Two new places, upon 
the same plan as the chapel, and built with similar materials, were afterwards 
erected, one for the boys' school, and the other for the girls'; these, when 
finished, greatly facilitated the instruction of the people&#151;the 
accommodation they afforded, encouraging those to attend who had before been 
deterred.<br>
<br>
 The spot on which the old chapel and subsequent school had 
been erected, was connected with an important event in the modern history,
&#150; 365 &#150; not only of Huahine, but of the several adjacent clusters of 
islands. In September, 1773, when Captains Cook and Furneux left Huahine, the 
latter was accompanied by a native, who had intimated his desire to proceed in 
the ship on a visit to Britain. He was a Raiatean; who, after a defeat which 
his countrymen had sustained in an engagement with the daring and warlike 
natives of Borabora, had taken shelter in Huahine. His inducement to undertake 
a voyage, of the incidents and exposures of which he could form no idea, does 
not appear to have resulted so much from a wish to gratify a restless and 
ardent curiosity, as from the desire to obtain the means of avenging his 
country, and regaining the hereditary possessions of his family, which were now 
occupied by the victors.<br>
<br>
 The name of this individual was Mai, usually 
called Omai, from the circumstance of the o being prefixed in the native 
language to nouns in the nominative case. Mai is the name of the present king 
of Borabora, though I am not certain of his having descended from the same 
family. The Mai who accompanied Captain Furneux does not appear to have been 
connected by birth or rank with the regal or sacerdotal class, although, among 
other accounts circulated respecting him while in England, it was stated that 
he was a priest of the sun, an office and title unknown in his native islands. 
He represented himself as a hoa, friend or attendant, on the king. In person he 
was tall and thin, easy and engaging in his manners, and polite in his address; 
but in symmetry of form, expression of countenance, general outline of feature, 
and shade of complexion, inferior to the majority of his countrymen. His 
conversation&#150; 366 &#150; was said to be lively and facetious. He reached 
England when the interest of Captain Cook's first voyage, and the deep 
impression produced by his discoveries, were still vivid and universal, and 
anticipation was raised to the highest pitch, in reference to the developments 
expected from his second visit to that distant part of the world. Mai being the 
first native of the islands of the South Sea, brought to England, produced an 
excitement as unprecedented, in connexion with an untutored islander, as it was 
powerful and extensive, even in the most polished circles of society. Mai, on 
his arrival in London, was considered a sort of prodigy; he was introduced to 
fashionable parties, conducted to the splendid entertainments of the highest 
classes, and presented at the British court amidst a brilliant assemblage of 
all that was illustrious in rank, and dignified in station. The Tahitians in 
general are good imitators of others; this talent he possessed in an eminent 
degree, and adopted that polite, elegant, and unembarrassed address, whereby 
the class with which he associated has ever been distinguished. Naturally quick 
in his perceptions, and lively in his conversation, although the structure and 
idiom of his own language effectually prevented his speaking English with ease 
or fluency, he was soon able to make himself understood; and the embarrassment 
he occasionally felt, in giving utterance to his thoughts, perhaps added to the 
interest of those who were watching the effect which every object in a world so 
new to him must naturally occasion.<br>
<br>
 Every place of public amusement, 
and every exhibition adapted to administer pleasure, was repeatedly visited; 
and the multiplicity of spectacles&#150; 367 &#150; thus presented in rapid 
succession, kept his mind in a state of perpetual excitement and surprise. The 
impression made by one object, was obliterated by the exhibition of some new 
wonder, which prevented his paying particular regard to any. This constant 
variety deprived him of all useful knowledge, and diverted his attention from 
the important subjects that demanded his notice while residing in the 
metropolis of Britain. A most favourable opportunity was afforded for his 
acquiring that knowledge of our agriculture, arts, and manufactures, our civil 
and religious institutions, which would have enabled him to introduce the most 
salutary improvements among his countrymen. Thus he might have become a father 
to his nation; and his visit to England might have been rendered a blessing to 
its latest generations. But, as Forster, who accompanied him on his return, 
laments, &#147;no friendly Mentor ever attempted to cherish and gratify this 
wish, much less to improve his moral character, to teach him our exalted ideas 
of virtue, and the sublime principles of revealed religion.&#148; To the 
censure thus passed upon those, under whose care he spent the period of his 
residence in England, one exception at least must be made, and that in favour 
of a name that will ever be dear to every friend of humanity. Granville Sharp 
became acquainted with Mai, taught him the first principles of writing, and, so 
far as his knowledge of our language allowed, endeavoured to pour the light of 
divine truth into his ignorant and untutored mind. He made such progress in the 
use of letters, that on his voyage to the South Seas, while staying at the Cape 
of Good Hope, he wrote a letter to his friend Dr. Solander.<br>
<br>
 During 
the two years he spent in this country,&#150; 368 &#150; he was inoculated for 
the smallpox, from which he happily recovered; and, loaded with presents 
profusely furnished by his friends, he embarked for his native island at 
Plymouth, in the summer of 1776. He accompanied Captain Cook to New Zealand, 
the Friendly Islands, and Tahiti, and, after an absence of rather more than 
four years, returned to Huahine on the twelfth of October, 1777.<br>
<br>
 In 
this island Captain Cook judged it most prudent to establish his 
fellow-voyager, and consequently solicited for him a grant of land from the 
chiefs. It was readily furnished, and a spot marked out, measuring about two 
hundred yards, along the sea-shore, and extending from the beach to the 
mountain. Here a garden was enclosed, and many valuable seeds and roots, which 
had been brought from England or the Cape of Good Hope, were planted. The 
carpenters of the vessels erected for him a house in the European style, and, 
on the 26th of October, the presents with which he had been so liberally 
supplied, were landed, and he took possession of his dwelling. In addition to 
the seeds and plants, a breed of horses, goats, and other useful animals, were 
brought on shore; but the greater part of the presents was comparatively 
useless, and many were bartered to the sailors for hatchests or iron tools. It 
does not appear that there was any implement of husbandry, or useful tool, 
included in the catalogue of his presents, though he landed with a coat of 
mail, a suit of armour, musket, pistols, cartouche-box, cutlasses, powder, and 
ball! Besides these, however, he was furnished with a portable organ, an 
electrical machine, fireworks, and numerous trinkets.<br>
<br>
 The estimate 
Captain Cook formed of his cha-&#150; 369 &#150; racter was correct: he 
appeared to have derived no permanent advantage from the voyage he had made, 
the attention he had received, or the civilized society with which he had been 
associated. He soon threw off his European dress, and adopted the costume, 
uncivilized manners, and indolent life, of his countrymen. Weakness and vanity, 
together with savage pride, appear to have been the most conspicuous traits of 
character he developed in subsequent life.<br>
<br>
 The horses, included among 
his presents, appear to have been regarded by Mai as mere objects of curiosity, 
and, when occasionally ridden, it was to inspire terror or excite admiration in 
the minds of the inhabitants. His implements of war, and especially the 
fire-arms, rendered his aid and co-operation a desideratum with the king of the 
island, who, in order more effectually to secure the advantage of his influence 
and arms, gave him one of his daughters in marriage, and honoured him with the 
name of Paari, (wise or instructed,) by which name he is now always spoken of 
among the natives; several of whom still remember him. He appears to have 
passed the remainder of his life in inglorious indolence or wanton crime, to 
have become the mere instrument of the caprice or cruelty of the king of the 
island, who not only availed himself of the effects of his fire-arms in periods 
of war, but frequently ordered him to shoot at a man at a certain distance, in 
order to see how far the musket would do execution; or to despatch with his 
pistol, in the presence of the king, the ill-fated objects of his deadly anger.
<br> <br>
 The majority of those whom I have heard speak of him, generally 
mentioned his name with execration rather than respect; and though some of the
&#150; 370 &#150; chiefs consider him as a man who had seen much of the world, 
and who possessed, according to their ideas, an amazing mass of information, 
his memory is certainly very lightly esteemed by his countrymen. As he does 
not, however, seem to have evinced, either on board the vessels in which he 
sailed, or among the company with which he mingled while in England, any latent 
malignity of character, or cruelty of disposition, he might perhaps have 
returned with very different sentiments and principles, had he fallen into 
other hands during his visit here.<br>
<br>
 The spot where Mai's house stood 
is still called Beritani, or Britain, by the inhabitants of Huahine. A shaddock 
tree, which the natives say was planted by Captain Cook himself while the 
vessels lay at anchor, is still growing on what was once part of his garden. 
The animals, with the exception of the goats and pigs, have all died; and in 
this instance, the benevolent intentions of the British government, in sending 
out horses, cattle, &amp;c. proved abortive. The helmet, and some other parts 
of his armour, with several cutlasses, are still preserved, and, when we 
arrived in Huahine, were displayed on the sides of the house standing on the 
spot where Mai's dwelling was erected by Captain Cook. A few of the trinkets, 
such as a jack-in-a-box, a kind of serpent that darts out of a cylindrical case 
when the lid is removed, were preserved with care by one of the principal 
chiefs, who, when we first saw them, considered them great curiosities, and 
exhibited them, as a mark of his condescension, to particular favourites. What 
became of the organ and electrical machine, I never knew. Among the curiosities 
preserved by the young chief of Tahaa, there was an article that I was very 
glad to see; it was a large quarto English Bible, with numerous &#150; 371 
&#150; coloured engravings, which were the only objects of attraction with the 
natives. I was told it belonged to Paari, or Mai, and hope it was given him 
among the presents from England, although no mention whatever is made of a 
Bible, or any other book, among the various articles enumerated by those who 
conveyed him to his native shores.<br>
<br>
 Within the limits of the grant 
made to Captain Cook for his friend Mai, some of the Missionaries, who in 1809 
took shelter in Huahine, after their expulsion from Tahiti in 1808, erected 
their temporary habitations. A few yards distant from the spot in which Mai's 
house stood, and immediately in front of the dark and glossy-leaved 
shaddock-tree planted by Captain Cook, the first building for the worship of 
Jehovah was erected; and on the same spot the first school in Huahine was 
opened, in which the use of letters, and the principles of religion, were 
inculcated.<br>
<br>
 Nearly in front of the site of Mai's dwelling now stands 
the residence of Pohuetea and Teraimano, to whom by right of patrimony Beritani 
belongs. It was, when I was last there, in 1824, one of the most neat, 
substantial, and convenient modern houses in the settlement, containing two 
stories and eight apartments. The district around, which when we arrived was 
altogether uncultivated, and overrun with brushwood growing in wild luxuriance, 
has been cleared; the garden has been again enclosed, and planted with many 
useful vegetable productions of the tropical regions. It is cultivated by its 
proprietors, who, there is reason to hope, are decided Christians. They 
erected, within the precincts of their garden, a beautiful but rustic little 
summer-house or cottage, which they call a<i>fare bure huna</i>, or house for 
hidden&#150; 372 &#150; prayer. I one day visited this garden, a few weeks 
after it had been enclosed and stocked with the most valuable indigenous plants 
of the islands. Towering above the plantains, papaws, &amp;c., the shaddock 
planted by Captain Cook appeared, like an inhabitant of another country, in 
solitary exile; for though the climate is similar in point of temperature to 
that in which it is accustomed to thrive, its shoots are not so long and 
vigorous, its leaves are not so clear, dark, and glossy as those of the other 
plants, and the fruit, though large and abundant, falls prematurely to the 
ground. The place where it stands is rather damp, and this may, perhaps, have 
caused it to appear so sickly.<br>
<br>
 After wandering some time among the 
clustering sugar-cane, rows of pine-apples, plantains, and bananas, I 
approached this house for private devotion. A narrow path covered with sand and
<i>anaana</i>, or branches of coral, led to the entrance. An elegant hibiscus 
spread its embowering shade on its rude and lowly roof. A native palm-leaf mat 
covered the earthen floor,&#151;a rustic seat, a table standing by a little 
open window, with a portion of the Scripture, and a hymn-book in the native 
language, constituted its only furniture. The stillness of every thing around, 
the secluded retirement of the spot, and the varied objects of nature with 
which it was associated, seemed delightfully adapted to contemplation and 
devotion. The scene was one of diversified beauty, and the only sounds were 
those occasioned by the rustling among the sugar-canes, or the luxuriant and 
broad-leaved plantains, while the passing breezes swept gently through them.<br>
<br> I naturally inferred that the house was appropriated to purposes of secret 
devotion; and meeting&#150; 373 &#150; its proprietor, I asked its use. He 
informed me that it was devoted to that object, and spoke with apparent 
satisfaction of the happiness he enjoyed in the retirement it afforded.<br>
<br>
 The erection of their dwelling, culture of their garden, building the house 
for hidden prayer, &amp;c. (the labours of the present proprietors of 
Beritani,) are very different from the erection of a boarded house merely as a 
fortress, in which are deposited, as the most valued treasures of its 
inhabitant, arms and ammunition. It does not appear that Mai's house was 
designed as a model by which the natives were to be encouraged to build their 
own, but a place of security for the property, which he was recommended to 
enclose with a spacious native building: and the pursuits of its present 
occupants are in delightful contrast with the childish exhibition of fireworks, 
or the display of those trinkets, by which it was endeavoured to impress the 
minds of the natives with ideas of English superiority. The events which have 
since transpired were but little anticipated by the distinguished navigator who 
conducted this simple-hearted native from one end of the globe to the other, 
spared no pains to promote his welfare and comfort, and who, although mistaken 
in the means he employed, undoubtedly aimed at the prosperity of the 
interesting people whom he had introduced to the notice of the civilized world.
<br> <br>
 Visiting almost daily the spot, and living in habits of intercourse 
with the successors of Mai, I have been often led to compare the views and 
circumstances of the present inhabitants of Beritani with those of the resident 
originally left there by its discoverer; and in connexion with the 
circumstances of Mai after his return to his native islands,&#150; 374 &#150; 
the following beautiful and pathetic lines have often occurred to my mind; and 
though perused on the spot with sensations probably unfelt elsewhere, I have 
nevertheless supposed, that could the poet have foreseen what has since taken 
place, not only in this island, but throughout the group&#151;or had he lived 
in the present day&#151;he would never, in anticipation of their abandonment so 
soon after their discovery, have recorded such mournful anticipations:&#151;</p>
<blockquote> 
<p>&#147;These I can pity, <br>
 But far beyond the rest, and with most cause, 
<br> Thee, gentle savage, whom no love of thee <br>
 Or thine, but curiosity 
perhaps,<br>
 Or else vain-glory, prompted us to draw <br>
 Forth from the 
native bowers, to shew thee here<br>
 With what superior skill we can abuse <br>
 The gifts of Providence, and squander life.<br>
 The dream is past. And thou 
hast found again<br>
 Thy cocoas and bananas, palms and yams, <br>
 And 
homestall thatched with leaves. But hast thou found<br>
 Their former charms? 
And having seen our state,<br>
 Our palaces, our ladies, and our pomp <br>
 Of 
equipage, our gardens, and our sports,<br>
 And heard our music; and thy simple 
friends,<br>
 Thy simple fare, and all thy plain delights, <br>
 As dear to 
thee as once? And have thy joys<br>
 Lost nothing by comparison with ours? <br>

 Rude as thou art, (for we returned thee rude<br>
 And ignorant, except of 
outward show,)<br>
 I cannot think thee yet so dull of heart, <br>
 And 
spiritless, as never to regret<br>
 Sweets tasted here, and left as soon as 
known.<br>
 Methinks I see thee straying on the beach, <br>
 And asking of the 
surge that bathes thy foot,<br>
 If ever it has wash'd our distant shore. <br>
 
Thus fancy paints thee, and, though apt to err,<br>
 Perhaps errs little when 
she paints thee thus.<br>
 She tells me too, that duly ev'ry morn <br>
 Thou 
climb'st the mountain-top, with eager eye<br>
&#150; 375 &#150;<br>
 Exploring 
far and wide the wat'ry waste<br>
 For sight of ship from England. Ev'ry speck 
<br> Seen in the dim horizon turns thee pale <br>
 With conflict of contending 
hopes and fears;<br>
 But comes at last the dull and dusky eve, <br>
 And sends 
thee to thy cabin, well prepared<br>
 To dream all night of what the day denied.
<br> Alas! expect it not. We found no bait <br>
 To tempt us in thy country. 
Doing good,<br>
 Disinterested good, is not our trade. <br>
 We travel far, 
'its true, but not for nought;<br>
 And must be bribed to compass earth again 
<br> By other hopes, and richer fruits, than yours.&#148;</p> </blockquote> 
<p>In the visit of Mai, the experiment, in reference to the effect of 
refinement, civilization, and philosophy, upon the ignorant and uncivilized, 
was tried under circumstances the most favourable for producing sympathy in one 
party, and impression on the other:&#151;the result was affecting. The 
individual who had been brought from the ends of the earth, and shewn whatever 
England could furnish, suited to impress his wondering mind, returned, and 
became as rude and indolent a barbarian as before. With one solitary exception, 
the humanizing and elevating principles of the Bible do not appear to have been 
presented to his notice, and he seemed to have derived no benefit from his 
voyage. Well might the poet lament his fate.&#151; But the ship Duff had not 
sailed, and the spirit of Missionary enterprise was not aroused in the British 
churches. Institutions, the ornament and the glory of our country, had not 
arisen. The schoolmaster was not abroad in the earth, and, proceeding onward 
with the tide of commerce that rolled round the world, the progress of 
discovery and science penetrating every remote, inhospitable section of our 
globe; the Bible and the Missionary had not been sent. Had Cowper witnessed 
these&#150; 376 &#150; operations of Christian benevolence, he would have 
cheered, with his own numbers, those who had gone out from Britain, and other 
lands, not only to civilize, but to attempt the moral renovation of the heathen.
<br> <br>
 The regularly framed and plastered chapels in Huahine and Raiatea 
were the first of the kind in the Leeward or Windward Islands; they were not, 
however, the only large buildings erected for public worship. Pomare had, ever 
since our arrival, been engaged in preparing materials, and erecting a chapel, 
at Papaoa, by far the largest ever built in the islands; it had been opened 
twelve months before those in the Leeward Islands were finished.<br>
<br>
 This 
building, which is called the Royal Mission Chapel, and might, not 
inappropriately, be termed the cathedral of Tahiti, is certainly, when we 
consider the imperfect skill of the artificers, their rude tools, the amazing 
quantity of materials used, and the manner in which its workmanship is 
completed, an astonishing structure. It is seven hundred and twelve feet in 
length, and fifty-four wide. Thirty-six massy cylindrical pillars of the 
bread-fruit tree sustain the centre of the roof, and two hundred and eighty 
smaller ones, of the same material, support the wall-plate along the sides, and 
around the circular ends, of the building. The sides or walls around are 
composed of planks of the bread-fruit tree, fixed perpendicularly in square 
sleepers. The whole either smoothed with a carpenter's plane, or polished, 
according to the practice of the natives, by rubbing the timber with smooth 
coral and sand. One hundred and thirty-three windows or apertures, furnished 
with sliding shutters, admit both light and air, and twenty-nine doors afford
&#150; 377 &#150; ingress and egress to the congregation. The building was 
covered with the leaves of the<i>pandanus</i>, enclosed with a strong and neat, 
low aumoa, or boarded fence; and the area within the enclosure was filled with 
basaltic pebbles, or broken coral. The roof was too low, and the width and 
elevation of the building too disproportioned to its length, to allow of its 
appearing either stupendous or magnificent.<br>
<br>
 The interior was at once 
singular and striking. The bottom was covered, in the native fashion, with long 
grass, and, with the exception of a small space around each pulpit, was filled 
with plain, but substantial forms or benches. The rafters were bound with 
braided cord, coloured in native dyes, or covered nearly to the top of the roof 
with finely woven matting, made of the white bark of the purau, or hibiscus, 
and often presenting a chequered mixture of opposite colours, by no means 
unpleasing to the eye. The end of the matting usually hung down from the upper 
part of the rafter three, six, or nine feet, and terminated in a fine broad 
fringe or border.<br>
<br>
 The most singular circumstance, however, connected 
with the interior of the Royal Mission Chapel, is the number of pulpits. There 
are no fewer than three. They are nearly two hundred and sixty feet apart, but 
without any partition between. The east and west pulpits are about a hundred 
feet from the corresponding extremities of the chapel. They are substantially 
built, and though destitute of any thing very elegant in shape or execution, 
answer exceedingly well the purpose for which they were erected.<br>
<br>
 This 
immense building was opened for divine service on the 11th of May, 1819, when 
the encampment&#150; 378 &#150; of the multitudes assembled stretched along the 
sea-beach, on both sides of the chapel, to the extent of four miles. On this 
occasion, three distinct sermons, from different texts, were preached at the 
same time, to three distinct congregations. Each audience, consisting of 
upwards of two thousand hearers, assembled round the respective pulpits within 
the same building. The king and principal chiefs appeared at the east, which, 
contrary to the order observed in their antipodes, is considered the court end. 
The whole number of hearers, according to the nearest calculation, was about 
seven thousand; and, notwithstanding this number assembled, a space remained 
between the different congregations.<br>
<br>
 I have occasionally preached in 
the Royal Mission Chapel, but never when any other person besides was engaged; 
consequently, I cannot say what effect is produced on the ear by the delivery 
of more than one discourse at the same time. In the account the Missionaries 
give of its opening, they say, the pulpits being at so great a distance from 
each other, no confusion ensued from the speakers preaching at once in the same 
house. To an individual who could have stood at one end of the building, a 
little above the assembly, and directed his glance to the other, the three 
pulpits and preachers&#151;the seven thousand hearers assembled around in all 
the variety, and form, and colour of their different costume&#151;must have 
presented an imposing and a deeply interesting spectacle.<br>
<br>
 Although 
divested of every thing like stateliness or grandeur, the first visit I paid to 
the chapel left a strong impression on my mind. I entered from the west; and 
the perspective of a vista, extending&#150; 379 &#150; upwards of seven hundred 
feet, partially illuminated by the bright glow of strong noon-day light 
entering through the windows, which were opened at distant intervals, along the 
lengthened line of pillars that support the rafters&#151;the clean rustic 
appearance of the grass-spread floor&#151;the uniformity of the simple and rude 
forms extending throughout the whole building&#151;the pulpits raised above 
them&#151;heightened the effect of their perspective. Beside these, the 
singular novel, light, waving, and not inelegant adornments of the roof, all 
combined to increase the effect. The reflections also associated with the 
purpose for which it had been erected, and the recent events in the history of 
the people, whose first national Christian temple we were visiting, awakened a 
train of solemn and grateful emotions. How it might be when the house was 
filled, I do not know; but when empty, the human voice could be distinctly 
heard from one end to the other, without any great effort on the part of those 
who at this distance called or answered.<br>
<br>
 A long aisle or passage, 
between the forms, extends from one end to the other. In walking along this 
aisle on my first visit, I was surprised to see a watercourse five or six feet 
wide, crossing, in an oblique direction, the floor of the chapel. On inquiry of 
the people who accompanied our party, they said it was a natural watercourse 
from the mountains to the sea; and that, as they could not divert its channel 
so as to avoid the building without great additional labour, and judged it best 
to make a grating at each side under the wall, and allow it to pass in its 
accustomed course. As it was not during the rainy season that we were&#150; 380 
&#150; there, it was dry; the sides were walled, and the bottom neatly paved; 
but in the rainy season, when the water is constantly flowing through, its 
effect must be rather singular on the minds of those sitting near it during 
public worship.<br>
<br>
 One end of the building was used by the inhabitants 
for divine service every Sabbath; the other parts are only occupied at the 
annual meetings of the Tahitian Missionary Society, or on similar occasions, 
when large national assemblies are convened. In 1822, when I last visited it, 
the roof had already begun to decay. The labour of keeping so large a place in 
repair would be very great; and the occasions for its use so seldom occur, that 
no repairs have been made since the king's death; and the exposure being 
constant, it will not probably last many years longer. The texture of the 
palm-leaves composing the thatch is not such as to resist for any protracted 
period and the intense heat of the climate.<br>
<br>
 It has appeared matter of 
surprise to many, that the natives should desire, or the Missionaries 
recommend, the erection of such large places of worship; and I have often been 
asked, how we came to build such immense houses. The Royal Chapel at Papaoa, 
however, is the only one of the kind in the islands. It originated entirely 
with the king, and in its erection the Misionaries took no part. The king, 
determined in his purpose, levied a requisition for materials and labour on the 
chiefs and people of Tahiti and Eimeo, by whose combined efforts it was 
ultimately finished. The Missionaries were far from approving of the scale on 
which Pomare was proceeding; and, on more than one occasion, some of them 
expressed their regret that so much time and property should be&#150; 381 &#150;
 appropriated to the erection of a building which would be of far less general 
utility than one of smaller dimensions. But the king was not thus to be 
diverted from his original design; and however injudicious the plan he pursued 
might be, the motives by which he was influenced were certainly commendable. He 
frequently observed, that the heaviest labour and the most spacious and 
enduring buildings ever erected, were in connexion with the worship of their 
former deities, illustrating his remarks by allusion to the national<i>maraes
</i> at Atehuru, Tautira, and other parts; declaring, at the same time, his 
conviction that the religion of the Bible was so much superior to that under 
which they formerly lived, and the service of the true God so happy and 
beneficial in its influence, that they ought to erect a much better place for 
the homage of Jehovah than had ever been reared for the worship of their idols.
<br> <br>
 In this statement of his motives, we have every reason to believe 
the king was sincere, and we consequently felt less inclined to object. It is 
probable, also, that considering the Tahitians as a Christian people, he had 
some desire to emulate the conduct of Solomon in building a temple, as well as 
surpassing in knowledge the kings and chieftains of the islands. When, in the 
course of conversation, the building was mentioned, or he was asked why he 
reared one so large, he inquired whether Solomon was not a good king, and 
whether he did not erect a house for Jehovah superior to every building in 
Judea, or the surrounding countries.<br>
<br>
 Excepting its lengthened vista, 
and the singular appearance of the ornamented roof, there is nothing very 
prepossessing in the interior of the&#150; 382 &#150; Royal Mission Chapel; and 
its length is so very disproportioned to its width and elevation, that the 
exterior is neither elegant nor imposing; and although it breaks the uniformity 
and loneliness of the landscape, it can hardly be said that its introduction 
has been an improvement. Pomare, however, appeared to experience great 
satisfaction in superintending its erection, and in marking its progress. He 
was present, surrounded by not fewer than seven thousand of his subjects, when 
it was for the first time appropriated to the sacred purpose for which it had 
been built, and his feelings on that occasion were, no doubt, of a superior and 
delightful kind&#151;very different from those of his predecessors in the 
government of Tahiti, and especially of his father, who, when the Missionaries 
built their little chapel at Matavai, for which he had furnished the timber, 
sent a large fish, requesting it might be suspended in the temple of the God of 
Britain, that he might share his favour, and secure his aid, as well as that of 
the gods of Tahiti.<br>
<br>
 The first places of worship erected by the 
natives, after the subversion of idolatry, were comparatively small in size, 
and differed but little from the common native houses, excepting in the manner 
in which the interior was fitted up. This was generally done by fixing benches 
from one end to the other, and erecting a kind of desk or table equally distant 
from both extremities, and near one of the sides. These chapels were formerly 
numerous, and the inhabitants of each district had their own<i>fare bure</i>, 
or house of prayer, in which they were accustomed to assemble twice on the 
Sabbath, and once during the week, for reading the scriptures and prayer. Such 
was the rapidity&#150; 383 &#150; with which places for public worship were 
erected, that at the close of 1818, twelve months only after the battle of 
Narii, near Bunaau&iuml;a, there were sixty-six in the island of Tahiti alone.
<br> <br>
 Since the establishment of the stations in Huahine and the other 
islands, the number has been greatly diminished; the people in many parts have 
resorted to the Missionary settlement, particularly on the Sabbath; and the 
places formerly used as chapels have been converted into schools. Places now 
used for worship in the islands, although not so numerous as formerly, are much 
more convenient and substantial. The walls are either of plank or plaster, the 
floors are boarded, and the area within is fitted up with a pulpit, desk, and 
pews, or seats. Some have neat and commodious galleries; and in the island of 
Eimeo, on the site of the temple in which Patii was priest, a neat and 
substantial chapel has been built with white hewn coral.<br>
<br>
 I have not 
heard that glass windows have been introduced into the chapels of any of the 
stations. Cushions have not yet intruded into any of the pews, and only into 
one of the pulpits.<br>
<br>
 No native chapel is yet furnished with a public 
clock; and although it would be a valuable article, there is not such a thing 
in the South Sea Islands. The stations have also been hitherto but 
indifferently supplied with a far more useful appendage to their places of 
public worship than even a dial, namely, a bell. Whatever may be said of the 
inutility of bells in churches or chapels in civilized countries, where public 
clocks are numerous, and watches almost universal&#151;the same objections will 
not apply to a people destitute of these, and having no means of denoting the 
hour of the day,&#150; 384 &#150; except by mentioning the situation of the sun 
in the heavens. In the South Sea Islands they certainly are not a needless 
article, and we found it impossible to induce the people to attend the schools, 
or assemble for public worship, at any regular or appointed season, without 
some such method of calling them together. For several years there was, in all 
the islands, only one small hand-bell, not so large as that ordinarily used by 
the bellman in an English market-town.<br>
<br>
 As the number of stations 
increased, bells were sent from England, but they were either too small, badly 
made, or carelessly used, and were frequently broken a few days after their 
arrival. Various were the expedients resorted to for supplying the deficiency 
thus occasioned, and I have often been amused at beholding the singular 
substitutes employed. In the Sandwich Islands they sometimes used a bullock's 
horn, or a long tin horn resembling that used by a mail-coach guard; but, in 
general, a far more classic instrument, a beautiful marine shell, a species of 
turbo, or trumpet-shell, varying in size according to the power of the 
individual by whom it might be sounded. This, in fact, was the trumpet carried 
by the king's messenger; and I have often been delighted to see a tall and 
active man, or a lively and almost ruddy boy, with a light cloak or scarf 
thrown loosely over his shoulder, a wreath of flowers on his head, and a<i>maro
</i> or girdle around loins,&#151;a shell, suspended by a braided cord, 
carelessly hanging on his arm,&#151;going round the village, stopping at 
intervals to sound his shell, and afterwards, perhaps, inviting the listening 
throng to hasten to the school, or to attend the place of worship. I procured a 
trumpet-shell&#150; 385 &#150; actually used for these purposes in Oahu, during 
my residence there, and consider it one of the most interesting curiosities 
which I was enabled to deposit in the Missionary Museum.<br>
<br>
 At Eimeo, a 
thick hoop of iron, resembling the tier of a small carriage-wheel, suspended by 
a rope of twisted bark, and struck with an iron bolt, was substituted for a 
bell. At Huahine, during the greater part of my residence there, we had a 
square bar of iron, hanging by a cord of<i>parau</i> bark, from a high 
cocoa-nut tree that grew near the chapel; and our only means of calling the 
inhabitants of the settlement together was, by appointing a person, at the 
proper hour, to strike it several minutes with a hard stone. It had been so 
long in use, that the bar of iron was considerably battered by the blows.<br>

<br> The Missionaries at Raiatea procured what is called a pig of cast-iron 
ballast, a solid piece about three or four feet long, and six or nine inches 
square, with a hole through one end. Near the chapel they erected a low frame, 
consisting of two upright posts, and a cross-piece at the top, resembling a 
gallows, from the centre of which the pig of iron was suspended; and when used, 
struck with a stone. What the natives thought of it I do not know, but to those 
who were accustomed to associate with a gallows, and any object so attached to 
it, only ideas of an execution, or of a criminal hung in irons, its appearance 
was not adapted to awaken very gratifying feelings.<br>
<br>
 At Borabora, for 
a long time after Mr. Orsmond's settlement there, their only substitute for a 
bell was a broad carpenter's axe. The handle was taken out, a string passed 
through the eye, and when the inhabitants were to&#150; 386 &#150; assemble, a 
native boy went through the settlement, holding it up by the string with one 
hand, and striking it with a stone which he held in the other. When I last saw 
the boy going his accustomed rounds, I perceived that, in consequence of 
frequent and continued use, the side he struck had actually become concave, the 
opposite exhibiting a corresponding convexity.<br>
<br>
 But the most rude and 
simple expedient I ever beheld was at Raivavai, or High Island, where every 
implement of iron was as precious and as scarce as bells or clocks were at the 
other stations. At Raiatea, a sun-dial was erected, by which the natives, when 
the sun shone, were informed of the proper time for ringing their bell: at the 
other stations they usually applied to the Missionaries, by whose watches the 
meetings were regulated, but here they had neither dial nor watch: they 
therefore regulated their time of assembling in the school or the chapel by the 
situation of the sun. At the appointed time, the person whose office it was to 
call them together, went to the green-spreading tree, from one of whose lower 
branches their rude unpolished bell was suspended. It was a rough flat 
oval-shaped stone, about three feet long, and twelve or eighteen inches wide. A 
piece of twisted bark was tied across it, and fastened to the tree. A number of 
small round stones lay underneath, with which, when it was necessary to call 
the people together, the large one was struck. I could not imagine its use, 
until, in answer to my inquiry, the native teacher said, &#147;It is the bell 
with which we call the people to prayers.&#148; It appeared metallic to a great 
degree, as the sound produced by striking it was considerable; but not, I 
should think, such as could &#150; 387 &#150; be heard at a distance. These 
circumstances appear trivial, but they serve to shew the expedients resorted to 
in a state of society so peculiar as that now prevailing in the South Sea 
Islands.<br>
<br>
 For school the bell is rung, the shell sounded, or the bar 
of iron beaten, only once; which is about a quarter of an hour before it 
commences. For public worship it is repeated a second time&#151;once at a 
quarter before the commencement, and again immediately preceding the service; 
and indifferent as the means of giving public notice are there is no cause to 
complain of delay or interruption, from the late attendance of the people. They 
are punctual in repairing to the house of prayer after the first intimation, 
and are usually all assembled before the period for the service to commence has 
arrived. Their ready and early attendance is a circumstance cheering to their 
teachers, who often receive a message, informing them, that though it may not 
be time to ring the second bell, the house is full, and the people are waiting. 
This is not only manifested with regard to their Sabbath-day services, but 
their lecture on Wednesday evening, and their monthly Missionary 
prayer-meetings. It is true, their occupations at home are seldom very urgent, 
and they have not much to neglect; it is nevertheless encouraging to notice, 
that they do not wish to avoid a place of worship, when a public service is 
held.</p>

<br> <br>
 While the enclosure of plantations and gardens, the erection of neat 
and commodious dwellings, schools, and the spacious place of worship, after the 
European plan, were rapidly altering the aspect of the settlement, the natives 
themselves were undergoing a change of appearance in perfect harmony with this 
transformation. The females, no longer exposed to that humiliating neglect to 
which idolatry had subjected them, enjoyed the comforts of domestic life, the 
pleasure resulting from the culture of their minds, the ability to read the 
scriptures, and to write in their own language, in which several excelled the 
other sex; they also became anxious to engage in employments which are 
appropriated to their own sex in civilized and Christian communities. They were 
therefore taught to work at their needle, and soon made a pleasing proficiency.
</p> 
<p>&#150; 389 &#150;</p> 
<p>The Missionaries' wives had taught some few in Eimeo prior to our arrival; 
but, until their reception of Christianity, they considered it degrading to 
attach themselves to the household of foreigners, or to learn any of their arts 
and customs; they also thought their own manner of wearing a piece of native or 
foreign cloth, cast loosely round the body, preferable to the European mode of 
dress, and consequently had no inducement to learn needlework, or any other 
female employment. They were, however, now anxious not only to adopt the 
English style of clothing, but also to be able to make their own dresses. This 
was a kind of instruction which our wives were competent to impart, even before 
they had acquired a sufficient knowledge of the language to enable them to 
teach in the schools. Mrs. Ellis had engaged in it ever since our arrival in 
Eimeo; and, as soon as we were settled in the Leeward Islands, some were daily 
occupied in teaching the native females to sew.<br>
<br>
 In Huahine a large 
class attended every afternoon from two o'clock till five, alternately at our 
respective houses, where Mrs. Barff and Mrs. Ellis met, and spent the afternoon 
pleasantly in each other's society, and unitedly teaching the females by whom 
they were surrounded. The natives, in general, now considered it a great favour 
to be taught, though it was sometimes found that they had entertained very 
incorrect ideas of the motives by which their instructors were influenced. A 
young woman had attended very regularly for some weeks, and had learned to use 
her needle as well as could be expected in that time. One Saturday night she 
presented herself with our native domestics, and begged to be paid her wages 
for learning&#150; 390 &#150; to sew! Mrs. Ellis said, Why should I pay you ? 
in our country it is customary for those instructed to pay their teachers. The 
woman answered with some earnestness, You asked me to come and learn&#151;I 
have been here so long&#151;I have learnt. It must be in some way advantageous 
to you, or you would not have been so anxious about it; and as I have done what 
you wished me to do, you ought to pay me for it. She was told that the labour 
of teaching had been gratuitous, and the advantage resulting was all her own; 
and appeared satisfied when assured, that now she had learned, she should be 
regularly paid for the needlework she might do. This, however, at the time to 
which I now refer, 1819, was a rare occurrence; although, in the earlier 
periods of the Mission, it had been frequently manifested, not only in regard 
to needlework, but every department of instruction.<br>
<br>
 Accustomed only 
to perform those services that were for the advantage of foreigners, the 
natives had been usually paid for the same. They could not conceive, 
notwithstanding the frequent explanations given, why the Missionaries should be 
so desirous for their learning to read, &amp;c. if they were not, in some way 
or other, benefited thereby: hence, many of the early scholars expected to be 
paid for learning, and I believe some for appearing at the chapel. This, 
however, was only manifested during the time when very few could be induced to 
attend, and none perhaps came from the influence of that desire for Christian 
instruction which attended the general profession of Christianity. After this 
period, it was only shewn by those who were actuated by a desire to obtain the 
favour of their superiors.</p>

<p>European cloths, cottons in particular, had long been favourite articles of 
barter with the natives, on account of their durability compared with native 
manufacture, their adaptation to the climate, variegated and showy colours, and 
the trifling injury they sustained from wet. They no longer traded for ardent 
spirits, muskets, powder, &amp;c. and were consequently enabled to procure 
larger quantities of British woven cloth. Hitherto, however, they had generally 
worn the European cottons, &amp;c. in the native manner, either as a light<i>
tehei</i>, thrown over the shoulder, a pareu wound round the waist, or <i>ahu 
buu</i>, a kind of large scarf or shawl, loosely covering the greater part of 
the body. They were now desirous to assimilate their dresses in some degree to 
ours. Mrs. Nott and Mrs. Crook made one or two loose dressing-gowns for Pomare, 
after a pattern from us. This introduced the fashion, and many of the women 
made others for their husbands.<br>
<br>
 The first garment in general use 
among the females, was a kind of Roman tunic, usually of white or blue calico, 
these being their favourite colours. It was fastened round the neck with a 
short collar, which, if possible, was united by a bright gilt or plated button. 
The sleeves were long and loose, and buttoned at the wrists, while the lower 
parts reached nearly to the ankles. On the outside of this, they wore the<i>
pareu</i> round the waist, and reaching below the knees. The colour of these 
articles was generally in perfect contrast. When the loose European dress was 
white, the<i>pareu</i>, worn round the waist on the outside of it, was of dark 
blue; one end of it was sometimes thrown carelessly over the shoulder, or hung 
loosely on the arm, heightening the novel and not&#150; 392 &#150; unpleasing 
effect produced by their blending, in the apparel of the same individual, the 
ancient native with the modern European costume. Their dress thus indicated, 
equally with their half-native and half-foreign dwellings, the peculiar 
plastic, forming state of the nation, and the advancement of that process which 
was then constantly imparting to it some fresh impression, and developing new 
traits of character with rapid and delightful progression.<br>
<br>
 As the 
natives experienced the convenience of the new dresses, their desire for them 
increased, and the long loose dress soon became an every-day garment, while 
others of a finer texture, made after the European fashion, were procured for 
special occasions. From making plain, straight-forward garments, the more 
expert were anxious to advance still higher; and in process of time, frills 
appeared round the neck; and, ultimately, caps covered the heads, and shoes and 
stockings clothed the feet. Our assemblies now assumed quite a civilized 
appearance, every one, whose means were sufficient to procure it, dressing in a 
garment of European cloth.<br>
<br>
 These changes in the exterior of the 
people were sometimes attended with rather humorous circumstances. I shall not 
soon forget the first time the queen, and about half a dozen of the chief women 
of Huahine, appeared in public, wearing the caps which had been sent as a 
present by some ladies in England. It was some time after the adoption of the 
English dress. When they first entered with their bonnets on, much surprise was 
not excited; but when these were removed, and the cap appeared, they viewed 
each other for some time most significantly, without,&#150; 393 &#150; however, 
saying a word, yet each seeming to wonder whether her head, with its new 
appendages, resembled in appearance that of her neighbour. The attendants, and 
others who were not so distinguished, after recovering from evident 
astonishment at seeing the Huahinian ladies for the first time in European 
caps, were by no means sparing in their remarks. Some observed, they were 
perhaps designed to keep the head cool; others, to keep it warm; and others 
supposed they were to preserve it from the flies and the mosquitoes. All agreed 
that they looked very strange, and the wearers appeared to think so themselves; 
but it was supposed to be according to the usage of ladies in England,&#151;and 
to the despotism of fashion, even here, all minor considerations were rendered 
subservient.<br>
<br>
 The desire to obtain foreign clothing was now very 
great, equal to that with which they sought iron tools; and whenever they 
procured one article of it, it was worn forthwith, without waiting till the 
suit was completed. This often rendered their appearance to a European eye 
exceedingly ludicrous. There was a degree of propriety usually manifested by 
all classes of the females in their dress: they either paid more attention to 
their appearance than the other sex, or were better informed; and the only 
inconsistency we ever observed was that of a woman's sometimes wearing a coat 
or jacket belonging to her husband or brother. The men, however, were less 
scrupulous: and whether it resulted from their fondness of variety, or a 
supposition that the same clothes, worn in different ways, would appear like 
distinct articles of dress, I am not able to say; but I have seen a stocking 
sometimes on the leg, and sometimes &#150; 394 &#150; on the arm, and a pair of 
pantaloons worn one part of the day in a proper manner, and during another part 
thrown over the shoulders, the arms of the wearer stretched through the legs, 
and the waistband buttoned round the chest.<br>
<br>
 Their own dress was 
remarkably simple in its form and appearance, and was generally more or less 
suited to their vocation. When employed in agricultural pursuits, or in 
fishing, in which occupation they were as much in the sea as out of it, the men 
seldom wore any other dress than their<i>tihere</i> or <i>maro</i>, a broad 
girdle passed several times round the body. At other times they wore a<i>pareu
</i>, which reached from the waist to the calf of the leg. Over the shoulders, 
when not at work, they wore a loose<i> ahu buu</i>, a kind of scarf or mantle, 
in some degree resembling the Roman toga; or they appeared in the<i>tiputa</i>, 
an article of dress, having an aperture in the centre through which the head is 
passed, the other parts extending over the shoulders, breast, and back. The<i>
tiputa</i> was generally worn by the chiefs and all persons of respectability.
<br> <br>
 This article is common to all the South Sea Islanders, and resembles 
in every respect, excepting the material of which it is fabricated, the poncho 
worn by the aborigines of South America, inhabiting the countries adjacent to 
the Pacific. The combination of these with some parts of the men's apparel worn 
in Europe, produced an effect less pleasing than the apparel of the females. 
Appearance and convenience, however, were not much considered by the Society 
Islanders, and it was often amusing to see a native<i>sans culotte</i>, without 
waistcoat or shirt, with a<i>maro</i> or <i>pareu</i> round his waist, and a 
fashionably made black coat&#150; 395 &#150; on his back. The men are generally 
above the middle stature, and proportionably stout, so that few of the coats, 
&amp;c. belonging to the captains or officers of vessels touching at the 
islands were large enough. If, however, they could by any means thrust their 
large muscular arms through the sleeves, it was thought to fit very well. 
Notwithstanding the warmth of the climate, they are fond of wearing the coat 
buttoned; and although when thus fastened it appeared less repulsive to our 
opinions of propriety, than when, standing open, it exposed the naked breast of 
the wearer, it was often quite distressing to see the imprisoned and pinioned 
arms occasionally struggling for liberty, and the perspiration oozing from the 
pores of the skin, indicating the laborious confinement of the body it enclosed.
<br> <br>
 These were scenes witnessed immediately after the general adoption 
of European clothing. Most of those who wear it now are able to procure at 
least one complete suit, and consequently appear less singular. In the 
arrangement, however, of the different articles of a complete dress, they were 
at first equally unhappy, and not unfrequently presented an appearance which it 
was impossible to behold with gravity. A tall man was sometimes seen with a hat 
and shoes, without stockings, a long<i>surtout</i> black-cloth coat, with the 
collar turned up and buttoned close to his chin, and over his black coat a 
white frilled shirt, the collar unbuttoned, and the bosom thrown open, the 
sleeves drawn up towards the elbows, and the outline of the other parts 
appearing in strong contrast with the black coat underneath, which reached to 
his ankles. Such an appearance was more than once presented, and the reason 
assigned for it was, that the shirt&#150; 396 &#150; was so much smaller than 
the coat, that had it, instead of the coat, been put underneath, it would not 
have been seen. Although exhibited in the person of a chief, the incongruity of 
such an arrangement furnished matter of ridicule even for themselves, and is 
now never seen.<br>
<br>
 European articles of dress are in the greatest 
demand; this method of clothing being adopted by all whose means enable them to 
procure either cotton or woollen cloth; and there are few, who, by preparing 
arrow-root, feeding pigs, manufacturing cocoa-nut oil, or other labour, cannot 
purchase from the shipping a suit of foreign clothing. I have frequently been 
delighted to see families of natives going on board the vessels, or repairing 
to the market-house on shore with the produce of their labour, and when they 
have arrived at the place of barter, and the captain or the merchant has spread 
before them his attractive goods, glossy and bright in all the shining colours 
of which they are so fond, the parent's eye has often glanced over them, in 
wonder when and how they were made. They have been seen occasionally looking 
down to notice what had attracted the attention of a little boy or girl, 
standing, perhaps, beside them; and if they thought the child could not 
distinctly see the different pieces, they have lifted it up, that it might look 
over the table, and then have asked the child which it would like to have. 
Sometimes the child would smile and hang its head, and fall upon its mother's 
shoulder, as if it knew not which to choose. At other times it would point to 
one, upon which the merchant has been directed to cut off so much as would make 
a frock or gown: it has been folded up, and given to the child; and while the 
parents' eyes have&#150; 397 &#150; marked the pleasure of the child as it has 
held the new frock on its arm, the smile on their own countenances has declared 
the pleasure they experienced. In many instances I have seen a garment for the 
mother next selected; and then the father, with the remainder of their native 
produce, has purchased some articles for himself. Their first effort now is 
generally to purchase, and to learn to make light clothing for their children; 
and there are perhaps few parents in the islands who would think of purchasing 
a garment for themselves, while their little one was destitute.<br>
<br>
 It is 
a pleasing fact, which demonstrates unequivocally that the South Sea Islanders 
are not deficient in capacity, but are capable, when inducement sufficient is 
offered, of acquiring habits of close industry, that in the islands of Raiatea 
and Huahine, or any of the stations in the Leeward Islands, there was hardly an 
adult female, excepting the aged and infirm, who could not use her needle so as 
to make her own clothes, and those required by other members of the family. I 
have not had equal opportunity of knowing what progress the females in the 
Windward Islands have made, but have reason to believe it is highly creditable 
to their application.<br>
<br>
 The occupation furnished by the new order of 
things that has followed the introduction of Christianity, is one of the 
important sources of their present enjoyment. But this is not the only 
advantage resulting therefrom. It has opened a new channel for commercial 
enterprise, and has actually created a market for British manufactures, the 
consumption of which, among the islands of the Pacific that have received the 
Gospel, is already considerable. Mr. Stewart estimates that the&#150; 398 &#150;
 trade of four American merchants in the Sandwich Islands amounts to one 
hundred thousand dollars a year; this, however, is a far greater amount than 
that of all the other islands of Polynesia. The demand will increase in the 
exact proportion in which industry shall augment the produce of the islands, 
and the property of their inhabitants. This is a consideration which, though 
confessedly very inferior to many, ought not to be disregarded by those who 
take an interest in the alteration of society which is now attending Missionary 
efforts in various parts of the world, but particularly in such countries as 
Africa, Madagascar, and the islands of the Pacific.<br>
<br>
 Shoes and hats 
are not much less in demand than cottons or woollens; and these also must, for 
the present, and probably for many years to come, be supplied from England or 
America. Although the light hats, made with a fine sort of grass, or the bark 
of a tree, are, in our estimation, remarkably well adapted to the climate, most 
of the men, making any pretensions to respectability, strive to possess an 
English hat. We were for a long time surprised at the partiality of the natives 
for woollen cloth, and hardly knew how to account for it, as it does not 
altogether arise from its being more durable. At one time, no article of dress 
was more acceptable to the men than a thick shaggy great coat, which, to us, it 
was quite oppressive even to behold. Many purchased with avidity a thick 
blanket, which they would wear as an<i>ahubuu</i> over the shoulders, or a <i>
pareu</i> round the waist. Frequently, when we have been burdened with the 
lightest crape or nankeen dress, a native, by no means deficient in corpulency, 
would walk several miles with an ordinary great coat,&#150; 399 &#150; without 
seeming to experience more than usual inconvenience. I never heard them 
complain of the heat; and the cause of their apparent insensibility to its 
oppressive influence is probably to be found in their being early exposed, and 
constantly habituated, to the climate.<br>
<br>
 Early in the year 1820, 
another important change took place in the dress of the Society Islanders; 
affecting not only their appearance, but tending perhaps ultimately to alter 
their physical structure. This was the introduction of hats and bonnets. If the 
skulls of those nations that wear no covering on their heads, are thicker than 
those who do, there is reason to suppose the craniums of the Tahitians will be 
much thinner in a few generations, than they have been prior to this period; 
since, from their earliest history, they appear to have gone abroad bareheaded. 
The inhabitants formerly wore a kind of bonnet, or rather shade for the eyes, 
made of the leaves of the cocoa-nut, in a variety of forms, many of them 
tasteful and elegant. They were called<i>taupoo</i> or <i>taumata</i>, and, as 
the latter name signifies, were designed to skreen the face or eyes; it being 
composed of<i>tau</i>, to hang upon or cover, and <i>mata</i>, face or eyes. It 
was worn on the forehead immediately below the hair, and fastened by a narrow 
leaflet passing round the back of the head above each of the ears, leaving the 
whole of the back and upper part of the head entirely exposed.<br>
<br>
 The 
first native bonnet we have heard of, as manufactured in the islands, was 
finished while we resided in Afareaitu, by Mrs. Ellis. It was made for our 
infant daughter, with leaflets of the fan-leaved palm, brought from the 
Marquesas; and the first hat we ever saw that had been made&#150; 400 &#150; 
there, was one the same individual made for me at Huahine, with the same kind 
of leaves, which were platted by a sailor in Eimeo. Hats and bonnets were, 
however, introduced among the natives by our friends in Raiatea, with whom many 
valuable improvements have originated; and the first hats and bonnets ever made 
in the islands, and worn by the natives, were made by Mrs. Williams and Mrs. 
Threlkeld, in the spring of 1820. Their appearance on the heads of the natives 
of Raiatea produced no slight sensation there; and the report of their use, as 
it spread through the islands, occasioned a considerable stir.<br>
<br>
 Highly 
approving of whatever had a tendency to civilize the natives, or to furnish 
them with useful employment, we rejoiced at their introduction, and endeavoured 
to persuade the natives of Huahine to follow the example of their Raiatean 
neighbours. Whether, however, they were influenced by a feeling of pride which 
made them averse to imitate the Raiateans, or an unwillingness to increase 
their domestic employments, we do not know; but the females in general, the 
queen and chief women in particular, seemed at first determined to resist the 
innovation. The men rejoiced at the idea of making hats; and yet, 
notwithstanding this, and the repeated offers of Mrs. Barff and Mrs. Ellis to 
teach the females to plat, and to make the plat into bonnets and hats, they 
were exceedingly averse to learn. Following the example of those in Raiatea, 
their teachers made bonnets for themselves with the bark of the<i>purau</i>; 
and though the chief women acknowledged that they looked very well on them, 
they said they had not yet procured the articles necessary to form a complete 
European dress, that&#150; 401 &#150; many were still without shoes and 
stockings, and that it would be quite ridiculous for the head to be covered 
with a bonnet after the fashion of the foreigners, while the feet, like those 
of the islanders in general, were without shoes. A short time afterwards, 
several of the natives of our island sailed over to Raiatea, and returned with 
very flattering accounts of the improved appearance of those who wore hats and 
bonnets. This induced in several of the chief women, who had at least one 
complete English dress, a desire to learn to make them, and ultimately to 
substitute the European bonnet for the native<i>taumata</i>. A visit which a 
number of chiefs and their wives, from Raiatea, paid to Huahine, increased 
their eagerness for this new article of dress&#151;which, when once adopted, 
was never laid aside.<br>
<br>
 The desire now became general, and was not 
confined to those who possessed other articles of foreign dress, it being 
extended even to such as had none. Thus, wearing a hat and bonnet was the first 
advance they made towards a more civilized appearance and dress. Our houses 
were now thronged by individuals anxious to be instructed; and so soon as Mrs. 
Barff or Mrs. Ellis had taught any of the females, these immediately taught 
others; and those who excelled in the fineness of their platting, or in putting 
it together, were fully employed by the chiefs and others, and derived no small 
emolument from their new avocation. Dress making and straw-bonnet making, now 
profitable employments to a number of females, were certainly the first regular 
female occupations from civilized society being introduced into the islands. 
The hats and bonnets were at first made with the inner bark of the&#150; 402 
&#150; slender branches of the <i>purau</i>, or the leaves of a fine species of 
rush. The former was beautifully white and glossy, while the latter was of a 
yellow colour, and much more firm and durable, on which account it was 
preferred for hats. The only hats I wore in the islands during the subsequent 
years of my residence there, were made with this material; and in that climate 
I should never desire any other. The use of hats increased so rapidly, that all 
the European thread in the islands was soon expended. There were no 
haberdashers' shops at hand, whence a supply could be procured; recourse was 
therefore had to native productions. Some employed the long filaments of the 
dried plantain-stalk; and others split the thin bark of the<i>purau</i> into 
fine threads or fibres, and, though not equal in strength to the twisted 
thread, both answered remarkably well.<br>
<br>
 The bonnets were in many 
instances scarcely finished, when another difficulty met their possessors. They 
had observed that the wives and daughters of the Missionaries, however plain 
their dress, wore a riband and strings to their bonnets, and they had often 
observed a greater profusion of trimmings attached to those worn by the wives 
of the captains, or the female passengers, in any of the vessels that touched 
at the islands; they therefore imagined that in point of improvement they might 
almost as well appear without a bonnet, as with one destitute of these 
appendages. These, however, it was no easy matter to procure, and they would at 
that time, certainly, have been the last article a captain or trader would have 
thought of taking to the South Sea Islands for barter. A few of the chief women 
were furnished with an English riband, which was considered as valuable as an
&#150; 403 &#150; embroidery of gold would be in some circles of society.<br>

<br> The greater portion of the inhabitants were, however, under the necessity 
of exercising their ingenuity to provide a substitute. Those they furnished 
were various, and such perhaps as few English females would have thought of. A 
part of a black coat, or a soldier's red jacket, cut into strips about two 
inches wide, was greatly esteemed. Next to this, ribands of native cloth, dyed 
with showy colours, were employed; while others used a string of the bark from 
a branch of the<i>purau</i>, with the outer rind scraped off, the inner bark 
washed and bleached, passed round the bonnet, and tied under the chin.<br>
<br>

 Trimmings are not so scarce now as formerly, but the supply taken is still 
inadequate to the requirements of the people, among whom bonnets and hats are 
now so common, that before I left the Leeward Islands, scarcely a man, woman, 
or child was to be seen out of doors without one&#151;many of them possessing 
two, and sometimes three or four.</p> 
<p>They are made entirely by the females, who manufacture not only for 
themselves, their husbands, and their children, but, in some of the stations, 
several have formed themselves into a kind of society, for the purpose of 
making bonnets for the poor and the aged, who are unable to make for 
themselves. The bonnets are either sewn together, or woven throughout, after 
the manner of Leghorns, and are made not only with the leaves of the<i>mau</i>, 
and the bark of the<i>purau</i>, but of the fine white layers of the inside of 
the plantain stalk, the leaf of the sugar-cane, and a strong and beautiful 
species of fine grass.</p> 
<p>&#150; 404 &#150;</p> 
<p>It may perhaps be supposed, by those who are unacquainted with the 
circumstances, that the wives of the Missionaries have not acted judiciously in 
introducing and cherishing a desire for dress. It may be thought that it has a 
tendency to engender pride, occupy the head and the hands about trifles, to the 
neglect of more important matters, inducing them to devote to the adorning of 
the person that time which might with greater advantage be appropriated to the 
cultivation of morals, and the improvement of their minds. The Missionaries, 
however, have not, in any degree, introduced the love of finery; they found it 
there, and cannot be supposed to have produced any change for the worse, in the 
taste of a people, by whom a black coat fringed round the edge with red 
feathers was considered a suitable dress even for a high-priest. The most showy 
English dress they ever saw, would probably, in the estimation of every 
beholder, appear comparatively plain, when placed by the side of those the 
natives formerly wore. The splendid appearance of the loose and flowing<i>ahu 
puu</i>, or the richness of the <i>tiputa</i>, dyed in their bright and 
favourite scarlet and yellow colours, together with some of their head-dresses 
of tropicbird feathers, and garlands of the gayest flowers, gave them certainly 
an imposing appearance. The former continued to be worn after their 
renunciation of idolatry; and the Missionaries knew no reason why they should 
recommend the discontinuance of a dress to which the nation was accustomed, 
merely on account of its gay appearance.<br>
<br>
 Convinced it is not in the 
dress with which the person is invested, but in the feelings of the heart&#150; 
405 &#150; with which that dress is regarded, that the evil exists&#151;and 
that pride does not consist in the wearing of apparel superior to that to which 
an individual may have been accustomed, or to that worn by others, provided it 
be suitable to his circumstances, and the society with which he 
associates&#151;they did not disapprove of the native dresses. But considering 
the danger to arise from substituting external adornment for internal worth, 
and imaging that distinction in dress confers an advantage on its wearer, or 
entitles him to that which he would not otherwise assume&#151;the Missionaries 
were led to conclude, that a Tahitian, arrayed in a scarlet and yellow<i>tiputa
</i>, or invested in the rich fold of his <i>ahu puu</i>, was perhaps as humble 
in mind as those who appeared desirous to divest themselves of every exterior 
ornament. Their principal aim, however, was to encourage habits of industry; 
and this, from the heat of the climate, the spontaneous productions of the 
soil, and other causes, appeared likely to be done by the introduction of what 
might be called artificial wants, which should operate on the native mind with 
power sufficient to induce labour for their supply. Idleness has been a most 
fruitful source of many of their vices and sufferings; and when we have seen 
the females working with their needle, or with the straw for their bonnets, 
&amp;c. we could not but deem it an occupation far more conducive to their 
enjoyment, than indolence, or their former unprofitable and often injurious 
pastimes. It is not to be expected that a people unaccustomed to mental effort 
should be constantly engaged with their books. They did not relax in their 
attendance at the school, or&#150; 406 &#150; any of the meetings for public 
instruction; and we observed with satisfaction, their altered appearance in all 
public assemblies, as indicating an improvement in civilization, and an 
increase of industry.<br>
<br>
 Their regular and early attendance on the 
Sabbath, ever has been, and still is, remarkably conspicuous; the day is to 
them a season of holy rest and devotional enjoyment. Excepting in Tahiti and 
Eimeo, there is now no island on which more than a single Missionary resides, 
and consequently public preaching only at the station which he occupies. The 
principal families in most of the islands have removed to the settlement, for 
the benefit of regular instruction. Others, however, occupy lands which are at 
some distance; and even those who have erected their dwellings near the 
residence of their teacher, having plantations situated in a remote district, 
are often absent for several days together. Most of them, however, repair to 
the settlement for the Sabbath; and it is a spectacle that has often gladdened 
our hearts, when, on the Saturday afternoon, we have seen parties from every 
direction approaching, by land or by water, the bay, at the head of which our 
settlement was formed.<br>
<br>
 In a walk through the village, on the 
afternoon of the day preceding the Sabbath, looking along the shore, we have 
often beheld the light canoe doubling a distant point of land, and, with its 
native cloth or matting sail, wafted towards the station. Others nearer the 
shore, with their sails lowered, have been rowed by the men; while the women 
and children were sitting in the stern, screened from the sun by a temporary 
awning.</p> 
<p>&#150; 407 &#150; Along the coast, many were unloading their canoes, or 
drawing them upon the beach for security.<br>
<br>
 The shore presented a scene 
of activity. The crackling fire or the light column of smoke might be seen 
rising through the district, and the natives busily engaged in cooking their 
victuals for the Sabbath. On account of their food being dressed for the 
Sabbath on the Saturday, that day is called<i>mahana maa</i>, food-day. As the 
evening approached, multitudes were met returning from the inland streams, 
whither they had repaired, to bathe after the occupations of the day; the men 
bringing home their calabashes of water for drinking, or their<i>aanos</i> of 
water for washing the feet; while the females were carrying home bundles of the 
broad leaves of the hibiscus, which they had gathered, to serve instead of 
plates for Sabbath meals. On entering the dwellings on the Saturday evening, 
every thing would appear remarkably neat, orderly, and clean&#151;their food in 
baskets&#151;their calabashes filled with fresh water&#151;their fruit 
gathered&#151;and broad hibiscus leaves plucked and carefully piled up for 
use&#151;their clean garments were also laid out ready for the next day. The 
hours of the evening, instead of being a season of the greatest care and hurry, 
are, I believe, often seasons of preparation&#151;&#147;prelude to hours of 
holy rest.&#148;<br>
<br>
 The sacred day was not only distinguished by a total 
cessation from labour, trade or barter, amusements, and worldly 
pleasure&#151;but no visits were made, no parties of company entertained, no 
fire lighted, nor food cooked, except in cases of illness. This strict 
observance of the Sabbath, especially in regard to the latter points, whereby 
the Tahitian&#150; 408 &#150; resembled the Jewish more perhaps than the 
Christian Sabbath, was not directly inculcated by the Missionaries, but 
resulted from the desire of the natives themselves to suspend, during this day, 
their ordinary avocations, and also from their imitation of the conduct of the 
Missionaries in this respect.<br>
<br>
 We have always been accustomed to have 
our usual beverage prepared in the morning and afternoon; but this is the only 
purpose for which, in ordinary seasons, a fire has ever been lighted for any of 
the Missionary families; and when destitute of these articles, which in the 
earlier periods of the Mission was often the case, no fire was lighted on the 
Sabbath; their food was invariably dressed on the preceding day, and the warmth 
of the climate prevented their requiring fire for any other purpose. In this 
proceeding they were influenced by a desire that their domestics, and every 
member of their families, might have an opportunity of attending public worship.
<br> <br>
 The example, thus furnished by their teachers, has led to the strict 
and general observance of the Sabbath by the nation at large. Their private 
devotions are on this, as well as other mornings, usually concluded by sunrise, 
and shortly afterwards the greater part of the inhabitants assemble for their 
Sabbath morning prayer-meeting. Besides a service in English, the Missionaries 
preach twice in the native language, and visit the Sabbath school; these 
services are as many as they are able to undertake: the service at the morning 
prayer-meeting is therefore performed by the natives. We have, however, 
sometimes attended, and always with satisfaction.<br>
<br>
 It is impossible to 
conceive the emotions of&#150; 409 &#150; delight produced by witnessing six or 
eight hundred natives assembling at this hour in the respective chapels, and, 
on entering, to see a native, one who was perhaps formerly a warrior or Areoi, 
or even an idolatrous priest, stand up, and read a psalm or hymn, which the 
congregation rise, and sing. A portion of the scriptures, in the native 
language, is then read; and the thanksgivings and petitions of the assembly are 
offered to Almighty God, with a degree of fervour, appropriate use of scripture 
language, and chastened devotional feeling, that is astonishing, when it is 
considered that, but a few years before, they were ignorant and barbarous 
idolaters. A second hymn is sung, another portion of scripture read, and prayer 
offered by another individual&#151;when the service closes, and the assembly 
retires.<br>
<br>
 Soon after eight o'clock the children repair to the 
Sabbath-schools, those for the boys and girls being distinct. About four 
hundred usually attend in Fare: they are divided into classes, under native 
teachers. About a quarter before nine, the congregation begins to assemble, and 
at nine the morning service commences. I have often heard with pleasure, as I 
have passed the Sabbath-schools rather earlier perhaps than usual, the praises 
of the Saviour sung by between three and four hundred juvenile voices, who were 
thus concluding their morning exercise. The children are then conducted to the 
chapel, each class led by its respective teacher, the girls walking first, two 
abreast and hand-in-hand, clothed very generally in European dresses; wearing 
bonnets made with a fine species of grass, or the bark of a tree; each carrying 
in her hand a neat little basket, made with&#150; 410 &#150; similar materials, 
and containing a catechism, hymn-book, and testament: the little boys following 
in the same order; more frequently, however, arrayed in the native costume, 
having a little finely-platted white mat, fringed at the edges, wound round 
their loins; another of the same kind, or a light scarf, dyed with glowing 
native colours, passed across their breasts, and thrown loosely over their 
shoulders; their feet naked, and their hair often cut short, but sometimes 
hanging in ringlets over their open countenances; and their heads covered with 
a neat little grass or straw hat, made by their mothers or their sisters.<br>

<br> Before the service began, they were usually led to the seats appropriated 
for them in the chapel; and where there have been galleries, these have been 
occupied by the scholars. Frequently we have been approaching the place of 
worship at the same time that the schools have entered it, and it has often 
afforded us satisfaction to behold a father or a mother, with an infant in 
arms, standing under the shade of a tree that grew by the side of the road near 
the chapel, to see, in the line of scholars, a son or daughter pass by. When 
the object of affection has approached, a smile of pleasure has indicated the 
gratification of the child at the notice taken by the parent, and that smile 
has been reciprocated by the parent, who, in silent gladness, followed to the 
house of God.<br>
<br>
 The morning service commences with singing, during 
which the congregations stand; a portion of scripture is then read, and prayer 
offered, the congregation kneeling or standing. This is followed by singing a 
second time; a sermon is then&#150; 411 &#150; preached, after which a short 
hymn is sung, prayer presented, and the benediction given; with which the 
service closes, between half past ten and eleven o'clock.<br>
<br>
 Although 
the religious exercises are now rather longer than they were when the people 
first began to attend, they seldom exceed an hour and a half on the Sabbath, 
and little more than an hour at other times. It has always appeared preferable, 
even to multiply the services, should that be necessary, than weary the 
attention of the people by unduly protracting them. In the religious services, 
the repeated singing, the reading prayers, and preaching, afford sufficient 
variety to prevent their being irksome or dull, while there is nothing childish 
and unmeaning, or purely ceremonial. When the congregation has dispersed, the 
children are conducted to the schools in the same order in which they came to 
the chapel, and are there dismissed by one of their teachers.<br>
<br>
 In the 
afternoon they assemble in the schools, and read the scriptures, and repeat 
hymns, or portions of the catechism, and are questioned as to their 
recollection of the sermon of the forenoon. We have sometimes been surprised at 
the readiness with which the children have recited the text, divisions, and 
leading thoughts in a discourse, without having written it down. Often it has 
been most cheering to see them thus employed; exhibiting all the native 
simplicity of childhood, mingled with the indications of no careless exercise 
of mind on the important matters of religion. It is always delightful to watch 
the commencement and progress of mental improvement, and the early efforts of 
intellect; but it was peculiarly so here. In the Sabbath-schools of the South 
Sea Islands,&#150; 412 &#150; the mechanical parts of instruction (namely, 
learning to read, spell, &amp;c.) are not attended to; the time is wholly 
occupied in the religious improvement of the pupils, and is generally of a 
catechetical kind.<br>
<br>
 Many of the parents attend as spectators at the 
Sabbath-schools, and it is not easy to conceive the delight they experience in 
beholding the improvement of their children, and in attending at an exercise 
often advantageous to their own minds. The greater part of the people, however, 
spend the middle of the day in their own dwellings. Formerly they were 
accustomed to sleep, but we believe this practice is by many discontinued.<br>

<br> The public service in the evening commences, in most of the stations, 
about a quarter before four, and is performed in the same manner as that in the 
forenoon. Meetings for reading the scriptures and prayer are held at some of 
the native houses in the evening, and we usually read a sermon in the English 
language in our own families.<br>
<br>
 The attendance of the people is 
regular, and the attention seldom diverted. At first we perceived a great 
inclination to drowsiness, especially during the afternoon: at this we were not 
surprised, when we recollected that this was the manner in which they were 
accustomed to spend several hours every day, and that they were also 
unaccustomed to fixedness of attention, or exercise of thought on a particular 
subject, for any length of time. This habit, however, has, we have reason to 
believe, very greatly diminished in all the islands, and more particularly 
where congregations regularly assemble.</p> 
<p>&#150; 413 &#150;</p> 
<p>The scrupulous attention to the outward observance of the Sabbath, may 
perhaps in some degree be the result of the impression left on the minds of the 
people by the distinguishing features of their former system, in which all the 
efficacy of their services consisted in the rigid exactness with which sacred 
days were kept, and religious ceremonies performed, without the least regard to 
the motives and dispositions of the devotees. To have kindled a fire, or to 
have failed in the observance of any rite enjoined, or restriction imposed, 
during their tabu, or sacred seasons, would have been sufficient, not only to 
have neutralized all the advantages expected from the most costly offerings or 
tedious services, but would have exposed the offenders to the anger of the god, 
and perhaps to death, as its consequence.<br>
<br>
 With many, the influence of 
a system so inflexible has probably operated powerfully in producing this 
uniform attention, at least to the outward duties of the Sabbath, the only 
sacred day now recognized amongst them; with others, there is reason to believe 
it arises from the influence of example, and the respectability it was at this 
time supposed to impart to individual character; but with many it originates in 
far higher motives, and is the result of Christian principle in regard to what 
they consider a duty.<br>
<br>
 A number of instances, strikingly illustrative 
of this fact, might be adduced: I will, however, only refer to one. A man came 
to the Monday evening meeting on one occasion, and said his mind was troubled, 
as he feared he had done wrong. He was asked in what respect; when he answered 
that, on the preceding day, which was the Sabbath, when returning from public 
worship, he observed&#150; 414 &#150; that the tide, having risen higher than 
usual, had washed out to sea a large pair of double canoes, which he had left 
on the beach. At first he thought of taking a smaller canoe, fetching back the 
larger ones, and fixing them in a place of security; but while he was 
deliberating, it occurred to his recollection that it was the Sabbath, and that 
the scriptures prohibited any work. He therefore allowed the canoes to drift 
towards the reef, until they were broken on the rocks. But, he added, though he 
did not work on the Sabbath, his mind was troubled on account of the loss he 
had sustained, and that he thought was wrong. He was immediately told that he 
would have done right, had he fetched the canoes to the shore on the Sabbath. 
When, however, it was considered, that perhaps this pair of canoes had cost him 
nearly twelve months' labour, and that, before they were lost, he was 
comparatively richer than many an English merchant is in the possession of a 
five or six hundred ton vessel, it appears a remarkable instance of 
conscientious regard for the Sabbath-day.<br>
<br>
 Since the abolition of 
idolatry, no part of the conduct of the South Sea Islanders has impressed the 
minds of foreign visitants more forcibly than their attention to the observance 
of the Sabbath. I never saw any, even the most irreligious, or those unfriendly 
to Missions, who were not constrained to confess that it surpassed all they had 
heard or imagined could have been exhibited; while others, more favourably 
disposed, have publicly declared its effect on their own minds.<br>
<br>
 When 
Mr. Crook arrived in 1816, the ship reaching Tahiti on the Sabbath, no canoe 
put off, no native was seen on the beach, no smoke in any&#150; 415 &#150; part 
of the district&#151;and they began to apprehend either that the population had 
been swept off by some contagious disease, or that they had all gone to battle. 
At length their fears were removed by one of the party, who had been there 
before, observing, that it was the Sabbath, and that on that day the natives 
did not launch their canoes, or light their fires, &amp;c. In 1821, Captain 
Grimes &#147;was surprised at the regularity and good order observed; the 
children of the Sabbath-school were ushered in by their teachers in their 
different classes, with as much uniformity as we see in public schools in 
London.&#148; Several masters of South Sea whalers, captains and officers in 
his majesty's navy, have borne the most decided testimony to these facts. A 
naval officer, who was at Tahiti in 1822, stated, that he visited the islands 
under a considerable degree of prejudice against the Missionaries, and 
suspicion respecting the reported change among the people,&#151;but that his 
visit had entirely removed both. It was Friday when the vessel arrived; the 
natives thronged the ship with fowls, fruit, vegetables, &amp;c. for sale, 
manifesting considerable earnestness and address in the disposal of their 
goods. The same was continued through the second day; but on the third, to the 
great astonishment of all on board, no individual came near the ship, 
assigning, afterwards, as a reason, that it was the Sabbath. On the day 
following, however, the trade was as brisk as it had been on that of their 
arrival. Captain Gambier, who visited them in the same year, in the extracts 
from his journal, which have been published, states, in reference to the manner 
of attending the duties of the Sabbath among the young, that, &#147;The 
silence&#151;the order preserved&#151;the devotion&#150; 416 &#150; and 
attention paid to the subject, surprised and pleased me beyond measure.&#148; 
&#147;Children,&#148; he adds, &#147;are seen bringing their aged parents to 
the church, that they may partake of the pleasure they derive from the 
explanation of the Bible.&#148; The general attention to the public worship of 
God, and the exemplary Christian deportment of many of the people, have proved 
not only delightful, but beneficial, to their visitors; and we are grateful to 
know, that occasional and transient visits to the Christian islands of the 
Pacific, have been the means of advantage to the visitors; and there are 
probably many instances of good, which the revelations of the last day alone 
will disclose.<br>
<br>
 It is a privilege to visit a country, and a happiness 
to live in a community, where the Sabbaths are thus spent, and prove to 
multitudes&#151;</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>&#147;Foretastes of heaven on earth&#151;pledges of joy <br>
 Surpassing 
fancy's flights and fiction's story,<br>
 The preludes of a feast that cannot 
cloy,<br>
 And the bright out-courts of immortal glory!&#148;</p> </blockquote> 
<p>This universal observance of the Sabbath-day appears to an Englishman in 
humiliating contrast with its profanation in many favoured sections of his own 
country. The contrast is still more striking when compared with the manner in 
which it is perverted into a season of activity, business, and unwonted gaiety 
in the pursuit of pleasure, in Catholic countries&#151;but it never appears so 
surprising as when viewed in comparison with the actual state of the people 
themselves only a few years ago. No Sabbath had then dawned no happy multitudes 
met for praise and prayer, no lovely throngs of children gathered in the&#150; 
417 &#150; Sabbath-schools, no inspired page or Christian preacher directed 
their attention to the Lord of the Sabbath; but when the devotees met for 
public worship, it was under the gloom of overshadowing trees, amid the 
recesses of some rude temple, before some rustic altar, or in the presence of 
some deity of frightful form and fearful attributes, the offspring of their own 
imagination.</p>

 The religious services of a general kind, among the natives, during 
the week, are not numerous. There is one lecture, which is on Wednesday 
evening. Numbers assemble at this time, and the exercise, we have reason to 
believe, is useful in keeping alive that interest in matters of religion, which 
might be diminished by the secular engagements of the week. The following 
account of one of these meetings is given by Captain Gambier, in the extracts 
of his journal.</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>&#147;On Wednesday afternoon we attended a native divine service. It was 
begun with a hymn; then Mr. Nott, who did duty, prayed extempore for some 
length, and then read a passage from the scripture, upon which he preached with 
great&#150; 419 &#150; fluency in the Otaheitan language. The church was well 
attended, though not so full as on Sundays, when it is crowded. Almost all the 
women, young and old, were habited in the European manner. The most perfect 
order reigned the whole time of the service. The devout attention these poor 
people paid to what was going forward, and the earnestness with which they 
listened to their teacher, would shame an English congregation. I declare, I 
never saw any thing to equal it! Objects of the greatest curiosity at all other 
times, they paid no sort of attention to, during the solemnity of their 
worship. After it was over, crowds, as usual, gathered round, to look at our 
uniforms, to them so new and uncommon. I looked round very often during the 
sermon, and saw not one of the congregation flag in their attention to it. 
Every face was directed to the preacher, and each countenance strongly marked 
with sincerity and pleasure. I had heard of the success of the Missionaries 
before I came to Otaheite, and, after making great allowance for exaggeration 
in the accounts they had sent home, there remained sufficient to lead me to 
anticipate that they had done a great deal. But I now declare, their accounts 
were beyond measure modest, and, far from colouring their success, they had not 
described it equal to what I found it. It is impossible to describe the 
sensations experienced on seeing the poor natives of Otaheite walking to a 
Protestant church in the most orderly and decent manner, with their books in 
their hands, and most of them dressed in European clothes. Having just quitted 
the Marquesas, where we saw the very state the Otaheitans were in at the time 
of their first visitors, we of course&#150; 420 &#150; saw the change to great 
advantage; and the magnitude of it is so astonishing, that all has the 
appearance of a dream. When, however, fully convinced of the reality, the hand 
of an Almighty Providence is distinctly acknowledged.&#148;</p> </blockquote> 
<p>There are special meetings, held once a week, for the instruction of those 
who desire to make a public profession of the Christian faith by baptism, and 
another for the candidates for communion. In addition to these, there is a 
public meeting for general conversation, or rather for answering the questions 
of the people, held every Monday afternoon or evening.<br>
<br>
 This meeting 
originated in that held on the 26th of July, 1813, for the purpose of writing 
the names of those who were desirous of publicly professing Christianity; and 
was designed for the particular instruction of such individuals, though it has 
since assumed a more general character. This has been one of the most important 
and efficient means of promoting general and religious improvement in the 
islands. The greater part of the inhabitants of the settlement in which it is 
held, and many from remote districts, having assembled in the place of worship; 
we usually took our seats near a table at one end of the building. Soon after 
the Missionaries have entered, a native, perhaps in some distant part of the 
house, stands up, and, addressing them by name, asks a question, states a 
difficulty that may have perplexed his mind, begs an explanation of a passage 
of scripture, or makes an inquiry relative to some subject or portion of the 
sacred volume, &amp;c. Our answers generally lead to farther questions, either 
from the first inquirer, or other individuals in the assembly. The conversation 
is sometimes continued until a&#150; 421 &#150; late hour; and both the queries 
and the replies are usually listened to with attention. We always endeavoured 
to divest these meetings of all formality and reserve, and to render them 
engaging, by accompanying our replies with suitable facts, &amp;c. as 
illustrations, and encouraging in the people the most unembarrassed confidence; 
requesting them to present all their difficulties, and solicit explanations or 
directions.<br>
<br>
 This meeting has always been highly interesting and has 
generally indicated the progressive improvement of the people. The subjects 
discussed are perhaps less miscellaneous now than they were some years ago, 
when the people were totally uninformed in all the first principles of 
Christianity; and the nature of these meetings in some of the stations has, 
perhaps, undergone a slight change. They are, however, productive of important 
benefit.<br>
<br>
 Subjects of every kind were formerly discussed, and 
questions brought forward relative to the discipline of children, the forming 
of connexions, and the whole of their domestic economy, agriculture, trade, or 
barter, legislature, war and politics, history and science, as connected with 
the natural phenomena by which they were surrounded, and, occasionally, what 
might be termed the first efforts of philosophical research in their partially 
enlightened minds.<br>
<br>
 When the political questions referred to their 
foreign relations, or their intercourse with other islands, we sometimes 
allowed them to be entertained; but whenever they were connected with any civil 
proceedings, or the internal government on the island, although the person who 
introduced it was not interrupted during his speech, the&#150; 422 &#150; 
matter was always referred to the king and chiefs, for whose consideration he 
was directed to present it at a convenient season, unless the chiefs, who were 
generally present, wished it to be then discussed.<br>
<br>
 One of the most 
curious and interesting topics of conversation, frequently introduced by the 
more thinking or inquisitive among them, was, the seat of the affections, and 
the locality of intellect. Their ideas and ours were totally at variance on 
this point; and, from the very nature of the subject, it was impossible to 
demonstrate the accuracy of one or the other. No part in the system of Drs. 
Gall and Spurzheim ever obtained among them; and so far from being 
phrenologists, they did not imagine the brain to be even the seat of thought. 
The frequent eulogy pronounced by us on an oration or action, in which 
understanding and right feeling are developed, viz. &#147;that it is creditable 
alike to the head and the heart&#148; of the speaker or actor, would have been 
altogether unintelligible to them. The only exception to the prevailing 
opinion, which deprives the head or brain of all connexion with the exercise of 
the mind, is the term for headache, which is<i>tahoa</i>, and is also used to 
signify confusion of noise, and perplexity from attention to a multitude of 
objects at the same time.<br>
<br>
 The phraseology employed in speaking of the 
seat of the intellect and the affections, presents another analogy between the 
idiom of their language, and that of the ancient Hebrews. When speaking of 
mental or moral exercises, they invariably employ terms for which the English 
word &#147;bowels&#148; is perhaps the best translation: hence they say,<i> te 
manao o te obu, or i roto i te obu</i>; &#150; 423 &#150; the thought of the 
bowels, or within the bowels;<i>te hinaaro o te aau</i>, the desire of the 
bowels;<i> te riri o te aau</i>, the anger of the bowels. Although bowels is, 
perhaps, the best single word for<i>obu</i> or <i>auu</i>, in the signification 
of which we have not been able to discover any difference, it does not convey 
the full meaning of the word<i>aau</i>. In some places it might be rendered 
heart according to our idiom, as in the thoughts of the heart or mind&#151;the 
desire of the mind, or soul&#151;or, the anger of the soul. For soul and 
spirit, however, they have distinct terms,<i>varua</i>, and the ancient word <i>
vaiti</i>; but it does not appear that they were accustomed to consider the 
soul or spirit as experiencing, in conjunction with the body, either mental or 
moral sensations. All the varied passions and the mental exercises of which 
they were sensible, they spoke of as connected with the<i>aau</i> or <i>obu</i>
, a term literally signifying the whole of the ibdominal viscera&#151;for each 
separate organ in which, they have a distinct name.<br>
<br>
 To the head they 
attributed nothing in connexion with intellect, nor to the heart with regard to 
moral feeling. To the organ which in the language of anatomy would be called 
the heart, they attributed no other susceptibilities than those which are 
common to other parts of the body. This led them generally to contend that the 
thoughts were in the body, and not in the brain; stating, in proof of the 
accuracy of their opinion, that the bowels or stomach were affected or agitated 
by desire, fear, joy, sorrow, surprise, and all strong affections or exercises 
of the mind. They were, probably, confirmed in this definition by the fact of 
such being the belief of their ancestors.</p> 
<p>&#150; 424 &#150;</p> 
<p>In reply, we usually informed them, that we were accustomed to speak of the 
heart as the seat of the affections and moral principles, though by the heart 
we often meant nearly the same as they intended by the word<i>aau</i> or <i>obu
</i>, but that we considered our sensations and mental perceptions to be 
connected with the brain. It was in vain that we endeavoured to shew the 
reasonableness of this opinion, by pointing out and explaining the connexion 
between the nerves pervading the several organs of sense, and the 
brain&#151;the cessation and interruption of mental sensation and exercise, 
when the nerves of the brain were permanently injured&#151;or when the line of 
nerves extending from an organ to the brain was broken. They usually answered, 
they would believe it because we said so, but that they did not understand it: 
nor was it to be expected that they should, as their knowledge of the anatomy 
of the human frame was exceedingly limited. They had no idea even of the 
existence of nerves, and it was necessary to introduce into their language a 
word by which they might be designated. Discussions of this nature, though 
adapted to interest the people, and encourage the exercise of intellect, were 
probably more amusing than profitable; and, notwithstanding the diversified 
subjects presented, their inquiries generally referred to the new order of 
things which Christianity had introduced.<br>
<br>
 In reference to this, while 
they were sometimes trivial, and perhaps ludicrous, they were often deeply 
interesting and important, and not unfrequently difficult and perplexing. I 
wrote many of them down at the time; others have been recorded by my 
companions: a selection will convey a more correct idea of their mode of&#150; 
425 &#150;thinking and expression, than any general description.<br>
<br>
 Many 
of their questions referred to the exercise of prayer, for punctual attendance 
to which they have been uniformly distinguished. Prayer for Divine direction 
accompanied their earliest inquiries on the subject of religion; and when in 
any district even two or three were desirous of becoming the disciples of Jesus 
Christ, they were accustomed to associate together for this purpose. Private 
prayer has long been almost universal, as well as the practice of imploring a 
blessing on their food; and although they at first asked whether they must not 
learn to pray in the English language? whether God would not be angry, if they 
should use incorrect expressions in prayer? or whether, when they had retired 
to their gardens, or the bushes adjacent to their dwellings, and were there 
engaged in prayer, their attention should be diverted by an intruder, they 
should leave off or continue? Sometimes they would ask, whether engaging in 
conversation, and praying, with very wicked persons, such as had been 
murderers, &amp;c. would not appear in some degree sanctioning or extenuating 
their crimes? With more frequency, however, and greater eagerness, they often 
inquired how they could prevent evil thoughts arising in their minds during 
seasons of devotion&#151;how they could avoid repeating words of prayer 
unattended by devotional desires&#151;and how they could at all times engage 
the heart in this exercise? I recollect a father and a mother asking with 
ardent solicitude, whether it would be right to take their little boy, or girl, 
with them to the bushes or the garden, talk with it in this retirement, and 
teach it there to pray to God? Prayer&#150; 426 &#150; in their families was 
regularly observed; and among the many inquiries in reference to this subject, 
it was once asked, whether Jesus Christ had family prayer with his disciples; 
whether, in their own houses, in the event of the sickness or absence of the 
husband, the wife should not convene the family, and perform this important 
duty?<br>
<br>
 Portions of scripture history and biography were among the most 
engaging subjects of inquiry, especially those contained in the Old Testament. 
Those in the New Testament also interested them. On one occasion, they asked 
what the heavy burdens were that our Lord accused the scribes and pharisees of 
binding on men's shoulders; and what was meant by &#147;Let the dead bury their 
dead.&#148; At another time they inquired who were the scribes, so often 
mentioned by the Saviour; and asked if they were the secretaries of the 
Missionary Societies in Jerusalem? &amp;c. This arose from the circumstance of 
the word, which in English is translated scribe, being in Tahitian rendered 
writer, and the secretaries of the native Missionary societies being the only 
individuals among them thus designated.<br>
<br>
 The usages and customs 
prevailing among the ancient Jews were often topics of conversation, and more 
than once they have, with evident sincerity, inquired if their repentance would 
not be more acceptable to God, were they to rend their garments, and cover 
their heads with ashes, or gird themselves with sackcloth, than simply 
expressing their penitence. This question, with those frequently asked relative 
to the consequences of mistakes or interruption in prayer, probably arose from 
the impression left by the system of idolatry&#150; 427 &#150; they had so 
recently abandoned, whose only excellency consisted in the correctness of mere 
external form and ceremony.<br>
<br>
 In all their idol worship, however large 
or costly the sacrifices that had been offered, and however near its close the 
most protracted ceremony might be, if the priest omitted or misplaced any word 
in the prayers with which it was always accompanied, or if his attention was 
diverted by any means, so that the prayer was<i>hai</i>, or broken, the whole 
was rendered unavailable, he must prepare other victims, and repeat his prayers 
from the commencement.<br>
<br>
 The history of our first parents was 
frequently brought forward. Sometimes they wanted to know what was the colour 
of Adam and Eve's skin, or what language they spoke: with regard to the former, 
their opinions were in accordance with those of the late Bishop Heber; they 
said it was very likely they were brown or olive-coloured, and, as their 
descendants, or the descendants of Noah, travelled to hotter climates, they 
became darker; while those, whose information had removed the belief that our 
colour was the effect of disease, acknowledged the plausibility of our 
ancestors having become white from the influence of cold, and a clouded 
atmosphere, whereby they were shaded from the sun.<br>
<br>
 More important 
matters concerning them were however often the subjects of inquiry. They felt 
interested in their destiny, and asked whether, after the fall, and expulsion 
from Paradise, they had repented and obtained pardon; and at one time, when, in 
answer to this question, it had been stated that there was reason to believe 
that they had obtained forgiveness, and were now in heaven, &#150; 428 &#150; 
the native immediately inquired further, how Adam's crime could affect his 
posterity, after the guilt contracted by it had been removed even from the 
perpetrators of that crime? The origin of moral evil was sometimes introduced. 
It has been asked, at meetings where I have been present, Would Satan have 
tempted Eve, or would man have fallen, if God had not forbidden our first 
parents to eat of the fruit of the tree of knowledge? To which it was answered, 
That if God had not made that the peculiar test of their obedience, Satan would 
have found some other medium through which to tempt them to sin.<br>
<br>
 A 
man once asked, What caused the angels in heaven to sin, or Satan to become a 
wicked spirit? He was told that pride was the cause of his fall, but that how 
pride entered heaven was not revealed. Another once proposed the following 
query: You say God is a holy and a powerful being, that Satan is the cause of a 
vast increase of moral evil or wickedness in the world, by exciting or 
disposing men to sin. If Satan be only a dependent creature, and the cause of 
so much evil, which is displeasing to God, why does not God kill Satan at once, 
and thereby prevent all the evil of which he is the author? In answer, he was 
told that the facts of Satan's dependence on, or subjection to the Almighty, 
and his yet being permitted to tempt men to evil, were undeniable from the 
declarations of scripture, and the experience of every one accustomed to 
observe the operations of his own mind. Such an observer would often find 
himself exposed to an influence that could be attributed only to satanic 
agency; but that why he was permitted to exert this influence on man, was not 
made known in the Bible. We always stated plainly, that it&#150; 429 &#150; was 
the contents of that volume which we came to teach them; that the existence of 
this baneful and often fatal influence was too extensively felt to allow of its 
being questioned; that the antidote to the evil it might have already 
inflicted, and the preservative against its future effects, were pointed out; 
and that it was wiser, and far more important, to apply to those remedies, than 
to indulge in unprofitable speculations relative to its origin.<br>
<br>
 The 
duration of sufferings inflicted on the wicked in the future state, was 
occasionally introduced; and more than once I have heard them ask, if none of 
their ancestors, nor any of the former inhabitants of the islands, had gone to 
heaven? This, to us and to them, was one of the most distressing discussions 
upon which we ever entered. To them it was peculiarly so; for we may naturally 
suppose, the recollection of the individuals whom many of them had perhaps 
poisoned, murdered without provocation, slain in battle, or killed for 
sacrifice, would on these occasions forcibly recur to their minds; and at these 
times, many a parent's heart must have been rent with anguish, to us 
inconceivable, at the remembrance of those children in whose blood their hands 
had been imbrued. Besides these sources of intensely painful reflection, there 
is something overwhelming in the thought of relatives and friends removed from 
the world of hope and probation, having their doom irrevocably fixed! Hence we 
could perceive a degree of painful emotion among the people whenever the 
subject was introduced; and although less intimately affected by this inquiry 
than those around us, it was to us a most appalling subject&#151;one on which 
we could not dwell with composure. This feeling, on their parts, also, has been 
at times&#150; 430 &#150; almost overpowering, and has either suspended our 
conversation, or induced an abrupt transition to some other topic.<br>
<br>
 
This is a most distressing consideration, and is a subject often brought before 
a Missionary's mind, from the circumstances into which his engagements lead 
him, and the intimate connexion of his every effort with the future and eternal 
destinies of those around him; while it furnishes, next to the love of Christ, 
one of the most powerful incentives to devotedness and unabated effort. Well 
might one now engaged in this work exclaim, &#147;Five hundred millions of souls
50 who are represented as being unenlightened! I cannot, if I would, give up 
the idea of being a Missionary, while I reflect upon this vast number of my 
fellow-sinners, who are perishing for lack of knowledge. &#145;Five hundred 
millions!&#146; intrudes itself upon my mind wherever I go, and however I am 
employed. When I go to bed, it is the last thing that recurs to my memory; if I 
awake in the night, it is to meditate upon it alone; and in the morning, it is 
generally the first thing that occupies my thoughts.&#148;</p> 
<p>What mind, under the influence of the unequivocal declarations of the 
sacred volume, and an acquaintance with the true condition of the heathen, can 
calmly entertain the thought of the millions who remain ignorant of the gospel?
<br> <br>
 We always told those who inquired, that it was not for us to say, 
what was the actual state of the departed; that of those who died in infancy, 
we were permitted to cherish the consolatory hope of their felicity; that those 
who survived&#150; 431 &#150; infancy, had not been without the admonitions of 
conscience, which had borne a faithful testimony to the character of all their 
actions; and that on the evidence of that witness they would be acquitted or 
convicted at the bar of God. At the same time assuring them, that whatever 
crimes they might have to answer for, rejection of the gospel would not be one; 
though this would, perhaps, involve the heaviest condemnation on their 
descendants, if by them that gospel was neglected or despised.<br>
<br>
 Many 
of their inquiries related to the proper observance of the Sabbath, and under 
what circumstances it would be proper to launch a canoe or undertake a voyage? 
This resulted from the king's sister being taken ill at Afareaitu, while we 
were residing there; and the natives wishing to send word to her relations, but 
hesitating because it was the Sabbath. A man once came and said, that while he 
was attending public worship, a pig broke into his garden; that on his return, 
he saw him devouring the sweet potatoes, sugar-cane, taro, and other 
productions, in which pine-apples were probably included, but that he did not 
drive it out, because he was convinced it would immediately return, unless he 
repaired the broken fence, and that he supposed was a kind of labour prohibited 
on the Sabbath. He therefore allowed the pig to remain till he was satisfied, 
and did not mend the fence till the following morning. He, however, wished to 
know, and the people in general were evidently interested in the 
inquiry&#151;whether, in the event of a similar occurrence at any future 
period, he should do wrong in driving out the animal, and repairing the fence. 
He was told that the most secure way would be to keep the fence in good repair; 
but&#150; 432 &#150; that if pigs should break in on the Sabbath, they ought by 
all means to be driven out, and the breaches they had made, so far repaired as 
to secure the enclosure till the following day. A chief of Huahine once asked 
me, whether it would be right, supposing he were walking in his garden on that 
day, and saw ripe plantains hanging from the trees that grew by the side of the 
path, to gather and eat them? I answered, that I thought it would not be wrong. 
I felt inclined to do so, said he, last Sabbath, when walking in my garden; but 
on reflecting that I had other fruit ready plucked and prepared, I 
hesitated,&#151;not because I believed it would be in itself sinful, but lest 
my attendants should notice it, and do so too, and it should become a general 
practice with the people to go to their gardens, and gather fruit to eat on the 
Sabbath, which would be unfavourable to the proper observance of that day.<br>

<br> Their inquiries referred not only to historical, biographical, and other 
facts connected with the sacred volume, but to those relating to other nations 
of the earth. The extent of territory, number of inhabitants, colour, language, 
religion, of the different countries of whom they had heard from occasional 
visitors, were topics of conversation at these meetings, together with the 
efforts of Christians to propagate the gospel among them. But the most 
interesting of these referred to England; and although their recollections of 
Captain Cook were generally more indistinct, and very different from those 
entertained by the Sandwich Islanders, he was often alluded to; and we were 
asked, if any members of his family still survived, and whether they would ever 
come to the islands. The cities, towns, houses, carriages, dress, and&#150; 433 
&#150; manners of the English, the royal state of king George, the numbers in 
his army, the evolutions of his troops, the laws of the kingdom, the punishment 
of crimes, the principles of commerce, and the extent and variety of 
manufactures, were at different times brought forward.<br>
<br>
 Numbers of the 
natives had indeed visited England, but their observation had been so limited, 
or their accounts so contradictory and exaggerated that their countrymen knew 
not what to believe, and not unfrequently, when any of these had returned, the 
substance of their reports was brought to the questioning meeting, to receive 
our confirmation or explanation. The religious character and observances of the 
English were usually matters of great interest. The dimensions and number of 
our cathedrals, churches, and chapels, the size of the congregations, the 
proportion of the population that attended public worship, and the order of the 
services, were often topics of inquiry. The experience of those who were true 
Christians in England, was also introduced; and their remarks on this point, 
especially when they first became interested in the subject of religion 
themselves, were often rather amusing. &#147;How happy the Christians in 
England must be,&#148; they would sometimes say.&#151;&#147;So many teachers, 
so many books, the whole of the Bible in their language, and no idolatry, they 
must have little else to do but to praise God. Their crimes have never been 
like ours; they never offered human sacrifices, murdered their infants, &amp;c. 
Do they ever repent? have they any thing to repent of?&#148; It was, however, 
only those who were recently awakened to a sense of the enormity of these 
crimes, and were but very partially informed as to the true state&#150; 434 
&#150; of England, that ever asked such questions as these.<br>
<br>
 The 
doctrine of the resurrection of the body has ever appeared to them, as it did 
when announced by the apostle to the civilized philosophers of Athens, or the 
august rulers in the Roman hall of judgment, as a fact astounding or 
incredible. Of another world, and the existence of the soul in that world after 
the dissolution of the body, they appear at all times to have entertained some 
indistinct ideas; but the reanimation of the mouldering bodies of the dead, 
never seems, even in their wildest flights of imagination, to have occurred to 
them. When first declared by the Missionaries, it merely awakened astonishment, 
and was considered as one among the many novel and striking facts connected 
with the doctrines which the new religion unfolded. But as the subject was more 
frequently brought under their notice in public discourse, or in reading the 
scriptures, and their minds were more attentively exercised upon it in 
connexion with their ancestry, themselves, and their descendants, it appeared 
invested with more than ordinary difficulty; bordering, to their apprehension, 
on impossibility. On this, as well as other equally important points, their 
queries, from native simplicity and entire ignorance, were sometimes both 
puerile and amusing.<br>
<br>
 A number of the attendants on the queen's 
sister, soon after their reception of Christianity, came to the meeting, and 
stated that one of their friends had died a few days before, and that they had 
buried the corpse according to their ancient manner, not laying it straight in 
a coffin, as Christians were accustomed to do, but placing it in a sitting 
posture, with the face between the knees,&#150; 435 &#150; the hands under the 
thighs, and the whole body bound round with cords. Since the interment, (they 
added,) they had been thinking about the resurrection, and wished to know how 
the body would then appear, whether, if left in that manner, it would not rise 
deformed, and whether they had not better disinter the corpse, and deposit it 
in a straight or horizontal position. A suitable reply was of course returned. 
They were directed to let it remain undisturbed&#151;that probably long before 
the resurrection it would be so completely dissolved, and mingled with the 
surrounding earth, that no trace would be left of the form in which it had been 
deposited.<br>
<br>
 Questions of this kind were only presented during the 
first stages of their Christian progress, and they were not frequent. In 
general their inquiries were exceedingly interesting. The time when, the means 
by which, the attending circumstances, and the manner of the resurrection, the 
recognition of friends, the identity of the bodies of adults, and whether the 
souls of infants would be united to infant bodies, and whether they would be as 
inferior in the future state, as their powers and faculties appeared in this, 
often furnished matter for interesting conversation.<br>
<br>
 There were, 
however, other points of inquiry, peculiarly affecting to themselves. Many of 
their relatives or countrymen had been devoured by sharks; a limb or large 
portion of the fleshy part of the body of others, had been destroyed by these 
voracious fish. A constant attendant on these meetings at Afareaitu had, while 
we resided there, one side of his face torn off, and eaten by one. The sharks, 
that had eaten men, were perhaps afterwards caught, and became food for the 
natives,&#150; 436 &#150; who might themselves be devoured by other sharks. 
Cannibalism, though some deny its having been practised among themselves, is 
supposed to have existed in one of the islands at least, and is known, and 
universally acknowledged to prevail among those by which they are surrounded; 
and it is not considered by them improbable that some of their own countrymen 
have been eaten by the islanders among whom they have, from stress of weather, 
been cast. The men who had eaten their fellow-men, might have been, and perhaps 
often were, (as many of the cannibals inhabit the low coralline islands, and 
live by fishing,) eaten by sharks, which would sometimes be caught and eaten by 
the inhabitants of distant islands.<br>
<br>
 After urging these and 
corresponding inquiries, which had exercised their minds, they would ask, After 
all these processes of new combination, will the original parts of every human 
body be reunited at the resurrection? &amp;c. On such occasions, the truth of 
the doctrine of the resurrection was exhibited, as demonstrated by the 
resurrection of Lazarus and of Christ; the identity of our Lord's body, by his 
subsequent intercourse with the disciples, especially with Thomas; and the 
certainty of the general resurrection presented, as deduced from the numerous 
and explicit declarations of scripture, and the reasoning of the inspired 
writers. The identity of the body was stated as being consistent with the 
character and moral government of God, which appeared to require that the same 
body which had suffered for or in his cause on earth, should be glorified in 
heaven; and that the same body which in union with the soul had been employed 
in rebellion and vice, should suffer the just consequences in a&#150; 437 &#150;
 future state. The declarations of Scripture on this momentous point, always 
appeared satisfactory; and although the circumstances of the resurrection, and 
the manner by which parts of the same body would be united, &amp;c. were 
inquiries pursued with deepest interest, we generally found them terminate in 
expressions of desire that they might be prepared, rise with glorified bodies, 
and come forth from their graves &#147;to the resurrection of life.&#148;<br>

<br> Questions, similar to those started by these untutored islanders, have 
frequently been agitated among the learned, in the ethical schools of Europe; 
and our most subtle casuists have found no easy task in obviating the 
difficulties which they involve. Even the changes which the body naturally 
undergoes in its present mortal state, militate against the supposition, that 
every atom once vitally united to the common mass will be included in the body 
that shall be hereafter, and direct us to admit that the resurrection must be 
consistent with innumerable mutations. Hence, we are taught to infer, that, 
while the identity of personality is preserved, the fluctuations which take 
place in the numerical particles, and in the modification of them, in our 
present bodies, can offer no impediment to the credibility of this momentous 
doctrine.<br>
<br>
 In connexion with this subject, and others of a similar 
kind, the most important referred to what might be called their Christian 
experience&#151;the effect of texts of Scripture committed to memory, in 
stimulating to duty, and restraining from sin. Often they would ask, &#147;How 
can we attain true repentance, and a change of heart? How may we know that we 
are not deceiving ourselves? How can we be preserved from forsaking God and 
committing&#150; 438 &#150; sin? We desire genuine faith; where can we obtain 
it? Once they observed&#151;Adam fell in Paradise, and angels fell even in 
heaven itself; how then can we be preserved from sinning against God? Tell us 
how we may be safe from Satan&#151;how we may be safe for heaven, and secure of 
admission there?&#148; I refrain from comments on the numerous inquiries 
brought forward at these meetings, which have been proved essentially 
serviceable to the nation&#151;stimulating inquiry, giving a proper direction 
to their search after truth, expanding and strengthening the mind, yet 
restraining them within the limits of revelation. Their inquiries shew, if 
evidence were wanting, that their mental capabilities are not contemptible, and 
demonstrate the influence of the highest order of Christian principles upon the 
mind and the heart.</p>
