<h1><b>EXOTIC BONSAI TREES FLOWERING,FRUIT AND LEAFY</b></h1> 
<p>In the category of exotic bonsai trees the wisteria is a good choice to the 
ordinary collection of bonsai available. It is an native,after all,of 
China,Korea and Japan. These trees,in the forest,can reach 30 feet. Imagine the 
difficulty in transforming these into bonsai,the reason being is they do not 
conform to many of the common styles.</p>
<p>The flowers in these bonsai have a variety of colors such as 
blue,purple,pink and white which are beautiful in their own right. They bloom 
in the spring at which time they require large watering efforts. The 
drainage,if sufficient,well allow the wisteria to do well in full sun to 
partial shade. For best results give your trees a good supply of fertilizer in 
the spring just before flowering. This should be repeated in late summer while 
the leaves are still on the miniature plant.</p>
<h1><b>ORANGE JASMINE ANOTHER CHOICE IN BONSAI TREES</b></h1> The bonsai 
provide many choices but the orange jasmine is an additional option in 
providing beauty and is delightful in aroma. The stark white blossoms,with the 
wonderful fragrance,also produce bright red fruit. The plant should be fed 
every three to four weeks.Light watering is most adequate for most of the year 
but in the hotter season you may want to provide additional water.These trees 
seem to flourish better in filtered sun and therfore an excellent candidate for 
indoor raising.
<h1><b> MIMOSA AN EXCELLENT CHOICE IN EXOTIC BONSAI TREES</b></h1>  These 
bonsai are sometimes referred to as silk trees. This is a result of their long 
silky thread like fiber. The mimosa is as fragrant as the others discussed 
before and their very lacy foliage and puffed up flowers are also beautiful. 
The flowers of the mimosa bloom in late April to early June so moderate 
watering is in order for these trees. A word of caution here,avoid the watering 
of the flowers since they will rapidly wilt and deteriorate when wet.
<p>This will be one of the larger trees in your hobby. They grow fast with 
large leaves and are extremely difficult to maintain to a small size. They will 
require lots of space wherever this plant is displayed.</p>

<h1><b>LET'S TALK ABOUT BONSAI TREES AND FRUIT</b></h1> 
<p></p> These trees,which produce fruit,are not dwarf varieties but are 
carefully crafted miniatures of a standard tree. There are many 
cherry,orange,apple,lemon,peach and other species which will form into 
excellent trees. It is important to select the type of fruit tree that is best 
suited to the climate in which the tree naturally grows. As an example citrus 
trees do not thrive in extreme northern climates but apple trees do extremely 
well. The cherry tree does well in parts of the midwest and south where lots of 
moisture exists.
<p>However this is not to say that you could not grow the other trees in your 
climate. If you can control the conditions through the use of a greenhouse or 
atrium structures,then by all means go for a species that you would prefer to 
see flourish.</p>
<p>In the selection of miniature fruit trees,the cherry tree continues to be 
one of the best choices. The profusion of pink flowers and red fruit are both a 
visual and sense of smell delight to everyone. These do well in full sun much 
of the year and will need partial shade during the hot parts of the summer. 
This is why I mention the conditions under which you can grow these bonsai 
trees in a contolled atmosphere.</p>
<h1><b> A CHINESE PLUM IS AN EXCELLENT EXAMPLE IN BONSAI TREES</b> </h1>  This 
species of bonsai produces pink and white flowers and purple fruit. This will 
certainly enchance your collection. It is true that most bonsai plants need 
some outdoors,this one can do well indoors with adequate sunshine. A hard 
commodity to come by in parts of the north and northeast. You should give them 
full morning sun and shade in the afternoon and evening. If you enjoy plums,you 
will certainly revel in this bonsai tree.
<p>Other types of fruit that lend themselves to becoming bonsai trees are: 
Quince,grape vines,and figs. One of the most interesting type miniatures,are 
black olive trees. In the wild these trees grow over 50 feet tall. They can 
easily be trained to spread out producing a beautiful display. The bluish 
leaves of this tree can lend a darker color to some of the brighter fruit 
trees. This is if you are really into this type of art and looking for a good 
contrast.</p>

below. Just click on the flashing sign. </p>
<p>The fig tree.of course is a challenge because in the real world the ficus 
grows to enormous size as it climbs to 60 feet tall and 60 feet wide. This 
makes keeping the canopy in control a real dedication to the art.So if you are 
going to attempt this,the fruit trees themselves are sold very young with only 
a root and a small trunk. This makes it essential that you water and plant 
immediately and use a good bonsai soil mixture. For my money I think I would 
buy one as a work in progress but that is only my opinion.</p>
