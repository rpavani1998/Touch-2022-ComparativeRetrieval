<h1>How to enjoy a once-in-a-lifetime safari in Africa: witness the 
incredible, often touching interactions of inspiring wildlife; relax with 
congenial fellow travelers in exceptional camps; swap stories with guides over 
the campfire; dine on memorable cuisine; sleep under canvas snuggled in fine 
linens; repeat.</h1> 
<h2>Africa Custom Safari Overview</h2> 
<p></p> 
<p>Exclusive, low-impact, and epic all describe our custom safaris in Africa. 
Bush flights deliver you to remote wilderness camps. Experienced naturalist 
guides will introduce you to the wildlife. The game in some parts of Africa is 
so intense, it is not unusual to encounter elephants, lions, buffalo, zebras, 
and many species of antelope on your drive from airstrip to camp. Deluxe (or, 
if you choose, downright luxurious) camps await you at day's end, in scenic 
locations, featuring inventive cuisine, congenial staff, and a relaxing 
atmosphere &ndash; perfect for reconnecting with friends and family.</p> 
<p>Boundless Journeys' staff has traveled extensively through the prime game 
regions of Africa, visiting camps and meeting guides, all to insure that your 
customized safari is easy to plan, and flawless and unforgettable once you are 
there.</p> 
<p></p> 
<h2>Private Safari Suggested Itinerary</h2> 
<p><em>Please note that as this is a private safari for you and your family or 
friends, it can be tailored to your preferences. The below overview is only one 
possible suggestion in Botswana based on our experience. We also offer custom 
safaris to Namibia, South Africa, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Tanzania, Kenya, and 
beginning in 2012, the Republic of the Congo.<br>
</em></p> 
<p><strong>Days 1-7:</strong> Safari in the Okavango Delta and Linyanti 
Concession, Botswana; activities include game drives, nature walks, and<em>
mokoro</em>canoeing, all based from some of the most luxurious permanent safari 
camps in Botswana.</p> 
<p>The Okavango Delta is justifiably considered one of the most incredible 
wilderness sanctuaries in Africa. At nearly 6,000 square miles, the world's 
largest inland delta is a wonderland of water channels, lagoons, and islands in 
the midst of the arid Kalahari Desert. Each year, floodwaters flow from the 
central African highlands hundreds of miles away to create a water-world 
bursting at the seams with herds of gazelle, zebra, giraffe and elephant, 
followed by prides of lions, packs of African wild dog, and high concentrations 
of cheetah and leopard. This high concentration of wildlife combined with 
Wilderness Safaris' camps on private concessions ensure that game viewing is 
spectacular all year long.</p> 
<p><strong>Days 8-10:</strong> Victoria Falls and Livingstone, Zambia; cruise 
the Zambezi River at sunset, go on wildlife and birding drives in Mosi-oa-Tunya 
National Park, and visit the incredible Victoria Falls. Optional activities 
include an elephant back safari, helicopter flights over Victoria Falls, and 
rafting on the lower Zambezi River.<br>
<br>
One of the Seven Natural Wonders 
of the World, Victoria Falls is known locally as Mosi-oa-Tunya, &quot;the smoke 
that thunders&quot;. It is an area of great scenic beauty:&nbsp;from the falls 
themelves to the broad upstream waters of the mighty Zambezi River. Birding 
here is particularly good, and most safari-goers &ndash; even those who don't 
consider themselves birders &ndash; find themselves captivated by the wide 
variety of entertaining birdlife in this region, in addition, of course, to the 
resident African buffalo, zebra, wildebeest, impala, and even white rhino.</p>

<p>Description of Trip Ratings</p> 
<p>Adventure travel may involve exotic destinations, unusual levels of 
physical exertion, and activities that may be new to you. We want to make sure 
that you choose the adventure that's right for you from our many one-of-a-kind 
trips. Each trip is rated on a scale of 1 to 5, with 1 being the easiest, and 5 
being the most strenuous. A few of our trips have had a &ldquo;+&rdquo; added 
to the number, indicating something that falls in between. Our Trip Ratings may 
be found on the trip schedule and on our website. Our detailed itineraries 
provide additional information on what to expect on the trip you are 
considering (detailed itineraries are available by mail, fax, or e-mail; or you 
can find them on our website, www.boundlessjourneys.com).We encourage you to 
call one of our travel experts with any questions or concerns that you may 
have. We are always happy to assist you in any way that we can.</p> 
<p>EASIEST 1</p> 
<p>Our easiest trips are generally hotel-based cultural and nature journeys 
that typically offer light activity. Optional walks and hikes (approximately 2 
to 4 hours) through gentle terrain with little elevation gain or loss. Altitude 
is typically not a factor on these tours. Other activities, such as snorkeling 
or sea kayaking, are optional. Examples: Indochina, Vietnam, Egypt, Galapagos 
Islands, Botswana, Tanzania.</p> 
<p>EASY TO MODERATE 2</p> 
<p>Hotel nights and/or deluxe, safari-style camping. Walking, hiking 
(approximately 3 to 5 hours), kayaking, or other activities on most days. 
Trails and paths are through rolling countryside, with occasional steep trails 
with up to 1,000 feet of elevation gain. Many of our hotel-based walking trips 
are in this category. Examples: Tuscany &amp; Umbria, Sicily, Morocco, Palau, 
Iceland, Turkey, Festivals of Bhutan, Costa Rica.</p> 
<p>MODERATE 3</p> 
<p>Full day hikes (approximately 4 to 6 hours) most days on unpaved trails and 
paths through hilly terrain with typical elevation gains and losses of 1,000 to 
2,000 feet. There may be occasional short steep sections of trail. Examples: 
Chile, Scotland, Spain, Bhutan &amp; Nepal.</p> 
<p>MODERATE TO STRENUOUS 4</p> 
<p>Full day hikes (approximately 5 to 7 hours) through mountainous terrain 
with significant elevation gains and losses (2,000 to 3,000 feet). Terrain may 
be rugged with uneven footpaths. The average altitude is generally no more than 
12,000 feet. Options are limited. These trips typically involve some camping or 
simple accommodations. Examples: Tour du Mont Blanc, Peru Trek, Bhutan 
Chomolhari Trek..</p> 
<p>MOST STRENUOUS 5</p> 
<p>Full-day trekking (approximately 6 to 8 hours) through rugged mountainous 
terrain with steep climbs and descents and one or more of the following 
present: elevation gains and losses of as much as 4,000 feet, altitude that 
exceeds 12,000 feet, and rugged uneven footpaths. These trips typically offer 
few options and include camping.</p> 
<h2>Activity Details</h2>  Safari game drives over varied terrain, river boat 
cruises, optional mokoro canoe excursions, and optional easy safari game walks. 
Typically 5 hours of activity per day. 
<h2>Traveling to and from</h2> 
<h3>WHAT TO EXPECT</h3> 
<p><strong>Typical Trip Rating</strong><br>
 Boundless Journeys&rsquo; trips 
are designed for energetic and flexible individuals who like to be active and 
have a spirit of adventure and a positive attitude. Ultimate Private Safari is 
rated 1, easy, on a scale of 1-5 (with 5 being the most strenuous). Our primary 
activities require little aerobic fitness, but some agility for getting in and 
out of vehicles, mokoro canoes, and walking through uneven terrain. This trip 
can be enjoyed by anyone who is in reasonably good health. We will walk where 
possible but this is often determined by the local area and country 
regulations. NOTE: Walking is at your own risk, and can take you close to 
dangerous wild animals.<br>
<strong><br>
 Preparing for this Trip</strong><br>
 
If you would like to take advantage of the optional nature walks, you may wish 
to engage in easy aerobic activities for 30-45 minutes a few times a week for 
several weeks before the trip. Consult your doctor before undertaking any new 
fitness program. &nbsp;<br>
<strong><br>
 The Safari Experience</strong><br>
 A 
variety of activities are included on our Ultimate Custom Safari, but the 
primary activity is game driving. The wildlife is typically most active early 
in the morning and late in the afternoon (these times also provide the best 
light for photography), and therefore we plan our activities accordingly. 
Typically, one of the camp staff will knock at your tent door early in the 
morning, and the group will gather for a quick, light breakfast and coffee or 
tea before departing camp as the sun rises. We move slowly, and even when 
animals are not present, the landscape and sounds of the bush are entrancing. 
We spend a few hours exploring and observing animals at watering holes or on 
the move from one region to another. As we come upon groups of animals, we 
allow plenty of time to simply observe and also take photographs. Our guides 
are experienced naturalists and will add greatly to your understanding of the 
animals. We keep a respectful distance &ndash; although the same cannot always 
be said about the animals and it is not unusual to come nose-to-car with 
baboons, zebras, wildebeest, gazelles, and elephants. By mid-late morning, we 
return to camp where a delicious brunch awaits.<br>
<br>
 After brunch, we 
enjoy a few hours of down time, enjoying the amenities of camp, resting, 
birdwatching, taking photos, or perhaps reading about the region you are 
visiting.<br>
<br>
 Later on, we gather for hors d&rsquo;ouvres and drinks 
before heading out for the afternoon activity. Some days this will be another 
game drive, while other times we may board mokoros for a quiet exploration of 
the waterways near camp or explore the area on foot in the company of our guide 
and a ranger. &ldquo;Sundowners&rdquo; &ndash; a light snack and cocktails 
served in the bush, are an African safari tradition, and a great way to enjoy 
unforgettable sunsets. We then make our way back to camp, sometimes driving 
with a spotlight to look for nocturnal animals.<br>
<br>
 In the evenings, 
dinner is enjoyed as a group, and will vary from seated meals ordered from the 
daily menu, to dining in the camp &ldquo;boma&rdquo; with a feast of 
traditional African foods and entertainment by the camp staff. These are joyful 
performances where it is often difficult to tell who is having more fun &ndash; 
the staff or the camp guests!<br>
<br>
<strong>Weather</strong><br>
 Summer is 
from November to the end of March and usually brings very high temperatures. It 
is also the rainy season and cloud coverage and rain can cool things down, 
although usually for only a short period of time.<br>
 The winter season begins 
in May and ends in August. This is also the dry season when virtually no 
rainfall occurs. Winter days are invariably sunny and cool to warm; however, 
evening and night temperatures can drop below freezing point in some areas. 
Please be prepared for cold weather in the evening/night/morning and bring 
plenty of warm clothing, including a hat, gloves, long pants, a fleece/wool 
top, and a windbreaker jacket. Tents and public areas are not heated, though 
the public areas do have fire pits, and beds are warmed with hot water bottles 
on cold nights. Ponchos are available for use in the safari vehicles.<br>
 The 
in-between periods - April/early May and September/October - still tend to be 
dry, but&nbsp; in April/early May the days are cooler than in summer, whereas 
September/October is the hottest time of year.<br>

<br>
<strong>When to Go
</strong><br>
 There are excellent reasons to visit the regions on this trip at 
any time of year, each offering slightly different experiences:</p> 
<p><strong>December-March: </strong>Many ungulates have their babies at this 
time of year, when the lush landscape provides both ample nutrition for 
mothers, and protection from predators. In addition to all of the big game, 
migratory birds are present in abundance. This is an excellent time of year to 
consider extending your safari with a trip into the Kalahari Desert, which is 
at its best during the rainier summer months (ask about our Botswana: The 
Kalahari Desert trip extension).<br>
<strong><br>
 April-June:</strong> The 
summer rainy season has drawn to a close. The tall grasses are starting to 
&ldquo;lay down&rdquo;, and some trees begin to lose their foliage, allowing 
for easier game viewing. At the same time, the annual flooding of the Okavango 
Delta is on its way in from the mountains of Angola, creating abundant 
waterways of incredible beauty, and attracting a wide diversity of wildlife. 
Animals tend to be in good condition at this time of year, as the food supplies 
remain plentiful. Baby ungulates born in the summer are now adolescent, and can 
be observed testing the skills they&rsquo;ll need as adults.<br>
<strong><br>
 
July-October:</strong> The dry winter season has begun to have an impact on 
both the landscape and the wildlife. The landscape is more arid in appearance 
although the floodwaters remain high, and the animals congregate in large 
numbers near the remaining watering holes. Predator and prey are often in close 
proximity in their intense need for water, leading to some memorable encounters.
<br> <br>
 No matter when you choose to go, you will see more elephants, 
giraffes, zebras, gazelles, buffalos, hippos, and lions than you can keep track 
of. Each departure is a little different in terms of order of areas visited, 
but offers the same quality of experience.</p> 
<h2>Suggested Custom Safari Accommodations</h2> 
<p><strong>Wilderness Safaris Classic accommodation o</strong><strong>verview 
(scroll down for Wilderness Safaris Premier accommodations suggestions):
</strong> Classic camps are generally tented camps, although a few are lodges 
built from permanent structures. All of these camps offer superb facilities and 
accommodation, the bedrooms being slightly smaller than those of our Premier 
camps, but still quite spacious. Many of the Classic camps' tents are raised 
off the ground with interconnecting walkways. All tents have en-suite bathrooms.
<br> &nbsp;<br>
<strong>Nights 1 &amp; 2: Xigera Camp<br>
 Xigera Concession in 
the Okavango Delta<br>
 Botswana</strong><br>
<br>
Xigera Camp (pronounced <em>
Keejera</em>) dwells on an island in the heart of the Delta in Moremi Game 
Reserve, set in a wetland paradise, surrounded by deep channels and lush 
riverine vegetation. The camp consists of ten luxuriously furnished tented 
rooms with en-suite facilities as well as an outdoor shower. Raised on wooden 
platforms and walkways, each tent offers superb views of the seasonal 
floodplain and lagoon and a feel of living in the midst of a riverine forest. 
Meals and evening drinks are enjoyed in the lounge and dining area overlooking 
a permanently flowing channel or under the stars in a traditional African boma. 
For those hot days there is a small plunge pool in which to cool off.<br>

<strong><br>
</strong><strong>Nights 3 &amp; 4: Duba Plains Camp<br>
 Kwedi 
Concession in the Okavango Delta<br>
 Botswana</strong><br>
<br>
One of the 
Okavango Delta's most remote camps, Duba Plains is a small, intimate camp on a 
tree-filled island in a private 30,000-hectare concession known as the Kwedi 
Reserve. Accommodations include six roomy tents with an en-suite bathroom, an 
outside shower, and a veranda overlooking the floodplain. The thatch-roofed 
lounge, dining room and bar areas are raised on platforms along with a swimming 
pool, all providing beautiful views.<br>
 &nbsp;<br>
<strong>Nights 5, 6 &amp; 
7: Savuti Camp<br>
 Linyanti Concession<br>
 Botswana<br>
</strong><br>
This 
intimate camp's en-suite accommodation is in seven large walk-in tents that are 
raised off the ground and face onto the Savute Channel's grasslands. From the 
camp's thatched dining area and pub, a plunge pool and large viewing area with 
fire pit extend outwards on raised wooden decks towards the Channel, providing 
a wonderful view of the waterhole where zebra and elephant regularly come to be 
refreshed.</p> 
<p><strong>Nights 8 &amp; 9: Toka Leya Camp<br>
 Mosi-Oa-Tunya National Park
<br> Zambia</strong></p> 
<p><em><strong>Recipient of Cond&eacute; Nast's hotel &quot;Hot 
List&quot;&nbsp;award.</strong></em><br>
<br>
Overlooking the mighty Zambezi 
River and some of its islands, Toka Leya Camp consists of 12 spacious en-suite 
safari-style tents. Wooden walkways snake between the units and main area, 
limiting our footprint on this pristine area. Tent interiors boast cool wooden 
flooring, tasteful, uncluttered African decor in earthy hues, climate-control 
for a cool summer sanctuary, and expansive wooden decks. The camp&rsquo;s 
dining, lounge and bar areas offer ample space for relaxation and are 
complemented by an infinity pool, with meals served on the sundeck, the pool 
deck or dining room; all overlooking the Zambezi.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Wilderness Safaris Premier </strong><strong>accommodation o</strong>
<strong>verview:</strong> Premier camps are the highest level of camps in the 
Wilderness Safaris portfolio and comprise their most elegant and stylish 
accommodation. These camps combine luxury, superb design and many comforts of 
home. Each Premier Camp has its own individual style, as well as additional 
features such as<em>salas </em>(an outdoor private porch with comfortable 
furnishings) for a soothing midday siesta. Each tent or bedroom has an en-suite 
bathroom, often with an additional outdoor shower under the stars.<strong>NOTE 
THAT THE PRICE FOR THIS LEVEL OF ACCOMMODATION IS FROM APPROXIMATELY $1250 PER 
PERSON, PER NIGHT.</strong></p> 
<p><strong>Nights 1 &amp; 2: Jao Camp<br>
 Jao Concession, Okavango Delta<br>
 
Botswana</strong><br>
<br>
Jao Camp has nine spacious, beautiful tents, each 
individually handcrafted. These twin-bedded canvas and thatched rooms are 
situated beneath a canopy of shady trees and have en-suite facilities, as well 
as an outdoor shower for the more adventurous. Built on raised decks, each has 
a private<em>sala </em>for afternoon siestas and offers wonderful views of the 
spectacular surrounding floodplains. In addition to the lounge and dining area, 
there are two plunge pools and an outdoor<em>boma </em>for dining under the 
stars, complemented by wines from an excellent wine cellar. Jao Camp also has a 
salon where a wide range of massage therapies are offered.</p> 
<p><strong>Nights 3 &amp; 4: Vumbura Plains Camp<br>
 Kwedi Concession, 
Okavango Delta<br>
 Botswana</strong><br>
<br>
Vumbura Plains consists of two 
separate seven-roomed camps, each with its own raised dining, lounge and bar 
area tucked beneath a canopy of shady trees and with a magnificent vista across 
the floodplains. A star-gazing deck with comfortable cushions protrudes into 
the floodplain, surrounding a convivial camp fire setting.<br>
<br>
 Vumbura 
Plains breaks the expectations of a classic safari-style camp. Each large, 
luxurious room is raised off the ground on wooden decks and each comprises a 
bedroom, lounge, shower and bathroom - with indoor and outdoor shower. The 
walls are simply screened on on three sides, and the billowing curtains between 
the various areas create the sense of being aboard a yacht floating through the 
floodplains. Each room also has a private plunge pool and<em>sala &ndash;</em> 
a comfortable area to relax, watching the waving grasses of the floodplain.</p> 
<p><strong>Nights 5, 6 &amp; 7: Kings Pool<br>
 Linyanti Concession<br>
 
Botswana<br>
</strong><br>
Nine well-appointed tents of canvas and thatch each 
have a large bedroom area, lounge, private plunge pool and<em>sala. </em>The 
spacious en-suite bathrooms are tiled with double showers and hand-basins as 
well as an outdoor shower for those who wish to shower close to nature! Raised 
walkways allow animals to wander freely through the camp to and from the water. 
The lounge, dining room and pub areas are on expansive raised decks and there 
is a pool and an open-air<em>kgotla</em> for dining under the stars.</p> 
<p><strong>Nights 8 &amp; 9: The River Club<br>
 Livingstone<br>
 Zambia
</strong><br>
<br>
The River Club, with its Edwardian-style house and manicured 
lawns on the banks of the swift-flowing Zambezi River where hippo and crocodile 
float, seems to straddle the continents of Africa and Europe.<br>
<br>
 Its 
main area is a well-appointed residence, with a comfortable lounge, large 
dining room, impressive library and wide veranda on which breakfasts and teas 
are taken. Lush gardens spread out beneath the trees and a croquet court is an 
ideal venue for a Pimm's-soaked croquet game. The pool seems part of the river 
itself, while a secluded deck with hammocks and loungers provides respite. A 
wellness center houses a treatment room for manicures, pedicures, facials and 
massages as well as a sauna, Jacuzzi and mini gym.<br>
<br>
 Ten luxury chalets 
are spread out on the property, all with en-suite bathrooms. One side is 
completely open to the river, so that there is an uninterrupted vista of the 
Zambezi and its far bank from both bed and bathtub. Each room looks west into 
glorious African sunsets best viewed from the privacy of a ball and claw bath, 
brim-full with bubbles. All have a concertina screen door or window across the 
front of the bedroom and/or bathroom.</p> 
<h2>Customized Safari Sample Itinerary</h2> 
<p><em>Please note that the following is a typical safari itinerary, and 
actual activities may be customized to suit your interests, to take advantage 
of weather conditions, local events, and to allow serendipity to play a hand in 
your experience. Some activites are also seasonal.</em><em>As this is a private 
safari for you and your family or friends, it can be tailored to your 
preferences. The below overview is only one possible suggestion based on our 
experience.</em></p> 
<p><strong>DAYS 1 &amp; 2<br>
 Into the Okavango Delta<br>
<br>
</strong><em>
<strong>Game drives, guided walks, and mokoro canoe excursions &ndash; easy, 
approximate total of 5-6 hours of activities per day. (Night drives also 
available with Classic Camp option).</strong></em><br>
<br>
 Upon arrival in 
Maun, you will be met by a Boundless Journeys/Wilderness Safaris representative 
and fly by light aircraft over the shimmering waters of the Okavango Delta. 
This initial flight provides a remarkable and beautifully scenic introduction 
to one of the world&rsquo;s most unusual ecosystems. The Delta represents life 
at its most fertile: abundant water, sunlight, and rich soil combine to form a 
paradise bursting with life and a landscape of indescribable beauty.<br>
<br>
 
By early afternoon, we arrive at our home for the next two nights: a deluxe 
tented camp located on the western edge of the renowned Moremi Game Reserve. 
This region is one of the most remote in the entire Okavango Delta and offers 
an unparalleled sense of wilderness. All the Okavango big game can be found 
here &ndash;&nbsp; including excellent chances of spotting predators.<br>
<br>
 
Activities over the next two days will include mokoroing (think Africa&rsquo;s 
version of the Venice gondola), guided walks, and game drives. If you choose 
the Premier camp option, night drives are possible as well. Lion, leopard, 
cheetah, wild dog, buffalo and elephant are all found in this area, as well as 
excellent concentrations of zebra, wildebeest, giraffe, and all the plains 
animals.<br>
<em><strong>Xigera Camp or Jao Camp, Okavango Delta, Botswana
</strong></em><strong><br>
<br>
 DAYS 3 &amp; 4 &nbsp;<br>
 Okavango Delta<br>

<br> </strong><em><strong>Game driving and nature walks &ndash; easy, 
approximate total of 5-6 hours of activities per day.</strong></em><br>
<br>
 
After a final morning game drive and brunch at our camp, a late morning bush 
flight brings us to the extreme northern Okavango Delta, an area of mixed open 
plains and vibrant wetlands that comprise a private concession managed in 
partnership with neighboring communities.<br>
<br>
 While here, you&rsquo;ll 
explore this new landscape on day and night game drives in open 4 x 4 vehicles, 
as well as on bush walks. When the Okavango&rsquo;s annual flood is at its 
highest (normally May to late September), boating, fishing, and mokoro trips 
are also a possibility if you&rsquo;ve opted for Premier camps. The variety of 
surrounding habitats ensures diverse and interesting wildlife viewing, 
including elephant, lion, zebra, red lechwe, giraffe, tsessebe, wildebeest, 
kudu, impala, leopard and bushbuck.<br>
<em><strong>Duba Plains or Vumbura 
Plains, Northern Okavango Delta, Botswana</strong></em><strong><br>
<br>
 DAYS 
5-7 &nbsp;<br>
 Linyanti Wildlife Reserve<br>
</strong><em><strong><br>
 Game 
drives and nature walks &ndash; easy, approximate total of 5-6 hours of 
activities per day.</strong></em><br>
<br>
 After breakfast, we fly 
north-eastwards, departing the Okavango, to the private Linyanti Concession; 
after a short game drive we arrive at our camp for the next three nights.<br>

<br> The landscape of the Linyanti Wildlife Reserve varies from floodplains to 
open, dry savannah and forest with sweeping views, creating a paradise for a 
high diversity of wildlife and bird species. During our three days here, our 
activities will include game drives and nature walks exploring a range of 
habitats, from riverbanks to scrub and forest, which reveal a myriad of 
wildlife en route to slake their thirst at the river. In particular, large 
herds of elephants can be found in this region during the dry season 
(May-October). Impressive even in small family groups, when these animals 
gather together in large numbers, it becomes an awe-inspiring sight you 
won&rsquo;t soon forget. In addition to the elephants, seldom-seen sitatunga 
can often be spotted in the waterways, as well as rare plains game, such as 
roan and sable antelope and their predators, the lion and leopard, with the 
endangered wild dog as an incredible bonus.<br>
<em><strong>Savuti Camp or 
Kings Pool Camp, Linyanti, Botswana</strong></em><strong><br>
<br>
 DAY 8 &nbsp;
<br> Into Zambia</strong><br>
<br>
 After a short morning drive and breakfast, 
we depart by light aircraft to Zambia. Upon leaving Botswana, we fly over the 
Kazangula border, a point where the four countries of Botswana, Zambia, 
Zimbabwe and Namibia. As we approach Livingstone, it is often possible to see 
the spray of legendary Victoria Falls from miles away.<br>
<br>
 We reach our 
camp on the banks of the Zambezi in the late afternoon, in time to enjoy a 
sunset cruise on the river before dinner.<br>
<em><strong>Toka Leya Camp or The 
River Club, Livingstone, Zambia</strong></em><strong><br>
<br>
 DAY 9 &nbsp;<br>
 Exploring the Zambezi<br>
<br>
</strong><em><strong>Various activities 
available.</strong></em><br>
<br>
 Activities available from our camps include 
game drives within Mosi-Oa-Tunya National Park, river cruises, fishing 
excursions, and guided nature walks. Tours of Livingstone town and museum and 
visits to Mkuni Market and Simonga Village are all outstanding ways of learning 
about the people and culture of this part of Zambia. Your guide will discuss 
the options with you upon arrival so that you can choose what interests you 
most. Other activities available in the area at an additional charge include 
helicopter flights, micro-lighting, canoeing, jet boating, elephant-back 
safaris, and white-water rafting.<br>
<br>
 There is rich birdlife in this 
area, including several sought-after species such as African Finfoot, 
Half-collared Kingfisher, African Skimmer (seasonal), Schalow&rsquo;s Turaco, 
and Rock Pratincole (seasonal). Excellent birding can be enjoyed within the 
camp itself, on boat cruises, and out on game drives.<br>
<br>
 The Zambezi 
River offers some fishing opportunities and tiger fishing is an unforgettable 
challenge for keen anglers, with the best months being October through 
December. There are several varieties of bream (<em>tilapia</em>) which are 
also a good catch.<br>
<br>
 Tonight you&rsquo;ll enjoy a final dinner in 
celebration of an unforgettable safari in one of Africa&rsquo;s greatest 
wilderness areas.<br>
<em><strong>Toka Leya Camp or The River Club, 
Livingstone, Zambia</strong></em><strong><br>
<br>
 DAY 10<br>
 Victoria Falls 
and Departure<br>
<br>
</strong><em><strong>Walking tour of Victoria Falls 
&ndash; easy, about one hour.</strong></em><br>
<br>
 Our grand finale is a 
guided tour of the Victoria Falls, one of the seven natural wonders of the 
world. At 1,708 meters wide, it is the largest curtain of water in the world 
and drops more than 100 meters into the sheer Zambezi Gorge.<br>
<br>
 By 
mid-morning we transfer to Livingstone's Harry Mwaanga Nkumbula International 
Airport and bid farewell to our adventure in time for early afternoon flights 
homeward.</p>
