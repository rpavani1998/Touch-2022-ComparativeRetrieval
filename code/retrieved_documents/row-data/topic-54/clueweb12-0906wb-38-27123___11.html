Fruit Trees -- A<br>

<h2>Fruiting Trees, Shrubs and Herbaceous Plants -- A</h2> 
<p>++ Indicates that this is a variety or a species that is found in our 
arboretum, but not often stocked in our nursery. Inquire about availability. If 
we do not have it in stock, we can put you on our &quot;waitlist&quot; and call 
you when we have it available.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<h3>Acerola</h3> 
<p>see <em>Barbados Cherry </em>on page 9.</p> 
<h3>Antidesma</h3> 
<p>see <em>Bignay</em> on page 9.</p> 
<h3>Apple, Subtropical</h3> 
<p><em>Malus domestica</em></p> 
<p><strong>FCFS available. </strong>Low chill apples bear farther south than 
ECHO in Florida, and may be a unique addition to your yard. Attractive white 
apple blossoms will appear during Feb-March and give way to fruit (smaller than 
standard apples) in June. They remain a small tree, growing to about 15 feet. 
Apples prefer slightly acidic and well-drained soils and perform best in full 
sun. The trees will need a complete fertilizer with micronutrients and may need 
to be defoliated by hand in the fall. Prune trees lightly in late winter to 
promote new growth. Because flowering, fruit development and spring vegetative 
growth all occur during some of Florida's hottest and driest months (April - 
June), irrigation is critical for succeeding with apples. To conserve moisture, 
mulching is highly recommended as long as mulch is not in contact with the 
trunk. Low chill apples are productive in Florida, but susceptible to 
anthracnose, fire blight, and root fungus. Apples require cross-pollination 
with two different cultivars to ensure decent production. The low chill 
varieties listed below require 50 - 150 chill hours for strong flowering and 
vigorous growth. Chill units are the number of hours the temperature stays 
between 32-55&ordm; F. Most effective chilling occurs with continuing 
temperatures below 45 &ordm; F.</p> 
<p>'Anna' has red skin and is the most widely planted apple cultivar in 
Florida. The fruit of 'Anna' resembles that of 'Red Delicious' more than other 
low-chill apple cultivars. Originally from Israel, this large apple can be 
eaten green similar to 'Granny Smith,' or can be allowed to ripen to desired 
sweetness.</p> 
<p>'Dorsett Golden' looks like 'Golden Delicious' with golden skin and 
sometimes a red blush. This cultivar was discovered in the Bahamas and is crisp 
and juicy with excellent flavor.</p> ++ 'Tropic Sweet' is a newly patented 
variety from the University of Florida. This low acid, very sweet apple has 
green skin with a red blush, and flavor similar to the 'Gala' apple.<br>

<h3>Atemoya</h3> 
<p><em>Annona squamosa x A. cherimola</em></p> 
<p></p> 
<p><strong>FCFS available</strong>. The Annona family contains many fine 
tropical fruits. The atemoya is no exception. This superb dessert fruit is one 
of Dr. Price's (ECHO's director), favorite tropical fruits. The sugar apple (
<em>A. squamosa</em>)<em> </em>and the cherimoya (<em>A. cherimola</em>) were 
crossed to produce the atemoya. The cherimoya needs cooler temperatures, but 
atemoyas thrive in the lowland tropics and can take a little more cold than the 
sugar apple. The fruit has fairly thin skin and black seeds. The pulp is white, 
fairly soft, sweet, and delicious. They are usually eaten fresh, but also make 
a great milk shake and tasty sherbet. Be sure to remove all the seeds before 
putting the pulp into a blender because the seeds contain the toxic substance 
rotenone. The trees produce as early as August and as late as January. Atemoyas 
reach a height of 25-30 ft. The tree has an irregular, low spreading habit, and 
is largely deciduous losing most of its leaves in the winter. Pruning is 
recommended on young trees to develop a desirable shape and to control 
excessively long shoots. As trees age, a March pruning (while the tree is still 
without leaves) is recommended for further shaping and size control. The 
flowers are self-fertile; however, hand-pollination will enhance the fruit set. 
A June pruning will result in additional flowering and later fruit development. 
Prune long terminal branches back to 5 or 6 nodes and remove the last two 
leaves closest to the pruning cut. Flowering should occur on new growth. We 
have several trees planted in 1996 growing in our arboretum .</p> 
<p>'Bradley' is less firm than Geffner, but the flavor and texture are of 
exceptional quality. ECHO staff preferred Bradley over Geffner in a 2001 taste 
test. However, Bradley is reported to not fruit very well without 
hand-pollination.</p> 
<p>++ 'Elly' is very productive like 'Geffner' but produces earlier. It has a 
creamy pear texture softer than 'Geffner's' firmer texture.</p> 
<p>'Geffner' is a productive, well known variety. It is probably the best for 
our area and the one we recommend most to customers. Our 'Geffner' froze almost 
to the ground, but grew back and produced about a dozen large fruit the second 
summer. It has good fruit production without hand-pollination and can be seen 
in our arboretum.</p> 
<p>'Priestly' is another very large fruited cultivar. Production does not seem 
as high as Elly or Gefner. The fruit is of good quality, but does have a 
slightly grainy texture.</p> 
<p>++ 'Rosando Perez' bears later than most other varieties of atemoya. The 
fruit is elongated and of good quality. This variety has historical importance 
in being one of the first atemoya cultivars released by the USDA in the early 
1900's.</p> 
<h3>Avocado</h3> 
<p><em>Persea americana, Persea nubigena</em></p> 
<p></p> 
<p><strong>FCFS available</strong>. Avocados are native to Central America and 
Mexico. From these regions, three distinct races have been recognized: West 
Indian (WI), Guatemalan (G) and Mexican (M). These races have been crossed to 
create innumerable hybrids. The ancestry determines cold hardiness, skin 
texture, and time of fruiting, among other things. The West Indian race is the 
least hardy (24-28 &ordm;F), and Mexican strains are the most hardy (16-24 
&ordm;F), but do not always fruit well in Florida's humid climate. See<strong>
Table 1</strong>for a comparison of other features of these three avocado races.
</p> 
<p>Choosing an appropriate planting location for avocadoes is extremely 
important. The first priority is a location that is high and has no history of 
saturated or flooded soils. Avocadoes demand well-drained soils, as flooding 
for 24-48 hours can kill them. They are especially susceptible to<em>
Phytophthera</em>, a common soil-borne fungus that causes root rot in avocado, 
papaya, citrus, and other susceptible plants.<em>Phytophthera</em> and flooding 
are a deadly combination for avocado. The second priority is choosing a 
location with full sun. Much energy from the sun is needed to annually produce 
the high numbers of large-seeded and oil-rich fruits. They also typically 
exchange their leaves each year in the spring, resulting in a bare appearance 
until new growth appears. The third consideration is space. Remember that 
avocado trees become huge, easily reaching 40'. They can be pruned to control 
size (immediately after fruit is fully harvested) but their habit is to become 
large.</p> 
<p>Aside from phytophthera, the only other significant problem we encounter 
with avocados is the Avocado Lace Bug (<em>Acysta perseae</em>) that feeds on 
the underside of leaves, causing brown blotches and premature leaf drop. 
Populations are especially high in late fall and, if possible, they should be 
controlled to prevent spread to newly emerging spring growth.</p> 
<p>Avocados are of two flower types, A and B, depending on when they are 
shedding pollen. &nbsp;A-type flowers shed pollen in the afternoon, B-type 
flowers shed pollen in the morning. There are different theories about avocado 
pollination, but recent research seems to demonstrate that self-pollination is 
the norm, meaning that only one tree is necessary for fruit production.&nbsp;

<p>Gaillard and Godefroy, &quot;Avocado&quot;, <em>Tropical Agriculturalist 
Series</em>, pg. 14</p> 
<p>'Beta' July to September, mid season fruit, 1- 1 &frac12; lb fruits, highly 
recommended for commercial planting, rounded, densely foliated canopy, 
consistently high producer. However the fruit is not of excellent quality.</p> 
<p>'Brogdon' (A and B type), a M &acute; WI cross, is productive and hardy to 
22&ordm; F. It is the most cold hardy variety we commonly stock in our nursery. 
Bears small smooth black-skinned fruits (8-14 oz.), with high quality green 
flesh. For those looking for a 'California' or Mexican type similar to ones 
found in the grocery store, Brogdon is a good choice. Its strength is its cold 
hardiness and excellent, rich flavor. Drawbacks include a large seed and paper 
thin skin which makes fruit difficult to peel. Brogdon ripens July-Sept.</p> 
<p>'Choquette' (A type), a G x WI cross, is oval-shaped and large (24-40 oz.). 
Skin is glossy, smooth, and slightly leathery. The smooth flesh is of an 
excellent quality with 13% oil and a mild nutty flavor. Choquette is similar to 
Monroe in fruit size and quality; both are excellent choices for those 
interested in a very good-tasting, large 'Florida pear'. The Choquette has an 
open, spreading growth habit. Freeze damage in established trees occurs around 
26&ordm; F. Season is Nov-Jan. with heavy bearing in alternate years.</p> 
<p>++ 'Custer's Red' originated as a seedling on Pine Island in southwest 
Florida. It is very cold hardy and was not damaged in 24&ordm; F temperatures. 
The fruit is medium-sized (14-24 oz.), oval, and has a mild flavor. We rarely 
stock this variety since ECHO staff find the flesh watery tasting. Both the 
mature fruit and new foliage have an attractive red blush. Fruit is ready for 
harvest when red blush appears; pick early and let fruit ripen off the tree. 
Bears Oct-Nov.</p> 
<p>'Day' (A type) is a G x WI cross. Fruit is small (8-16 oz.), pear-shaped 
with an excellent rich, nutty taste. Skin is green and dull. The tree is very 
productive and cold hardy; Dr. Price's tree in North Ft. Myers, FL survived the 
terrible freeze in 1989 with little damage while a nearby avocado was killed. 
Bears Aug-Sept.</p> 
<p>'Donnie' (A type), a WI type, is cold sensitive. It is the earliest 
commercial variety (May - June) and bears large fruit (greater than 1 lb). They 
are extremely mild, to the point of being bland. Its popularity is due to its 
early season.</p> 
<p>'Expedition' (Unknown flower type) likely has Guatemalan heritage. The 
round fruit is medium to large (bigger than Lula), with dull, dark green skin 
and contains a large seed. David Fairchild selected this high quality cultivar 
but much remains unknown about this cultivar. Expedition bears Nov-Jan., but 
the fruit can hang on the tree through February.</p> 
<p>++ 'Fuerte' (B type) is a M&acute; G cross commercially grown in many 
regions of the world. The fruit is small (12-14 oz.) with dark green bumpy 
skin. This cultivar is better suited to drier climates- a wet summer can cause 
the fruit to rot. This variety is not recommended for Florida. Bears Nov-Dec.
</p> 
<p>++'Kampong' (B type) is a Guatemalan race with high cold tolerance, but low 
yields. It bears a green fruit (14-24 oz) from Dec 1 to March 31.</p> 
<p>'Lula' (A type), a G x WI cross, produces medium (14-24 oz.), pear-shaped 
fruit with nearly smooth skin. Lula has a large seed and is slightly sweet with 
good flavor. Formerly grown commercially, it is a good producer, but very 
susceptible to scab (a disease which only harms the appearance). Lula is hardy 
to central Florida most years, freezing at about 25&ordm; F. Bears Nov-Jan.</p> 
<p>++'Marcus Pumpkin' has very high cold tolerance, a moderate yield and a <em>
huge</em> fruit - the fruits can weigh over 3 lbs. The flavor is very mild and 
is often described as watery. Its main appeal is its very large fruits. It 
bears Oct 15 to Nov 30.</p> 
<p>'Miguel' 1 &frac12; - 2 lbs fruits, fruits August to September, is large, 
productive and of excellent eating quality.</p> 
<p>'Monroe' is a G x WI cross grown commercially in the Miami/Homestead area. 
This variety is prolific, consistently bearing large fruits that mature in the 
fall. Flesh is of very good quality lacking the watery texture often found in 
other large fruited types. Monroe's growth habit is upright, rather than 
spreading and is cold hardy to 26&ordm;F. Monroe bears Nov-Dec.</p> 
<p>++ 'Russell' (A type) a West Indies avocado, is fairly frost sensitive. The 
fruit is 12-18 inches long, club-shaped, often weighing between 16-24 oz. It 
has smooth, glossy, green skin, and a small seed. This cultivar yields well and 
is of high eating quality. Russell bears July-Aug.</p> 
<p>++ 'Tonnage' (B type) belongs to the Guatemalan race. Fruit is medium sized 
(14-24 oz.), green, and has thick, rough skin. Production is good, but flavor 
is very mild and inferior to many other varieties. Freeze damage in established 
trees occurs around 26&ordm; F. The tree is tall, upright, and in SW Florida 
bears Sep-Oct.</p> 
<p>++ 'Wurtz' (unknown flower type) is of Guatemalan race and was discovered 
in California in 1935. Fruit is small pear-shaped, with a large seed and rough 
green skin similar to California avocados. Wurtz has rich flavor and is of high 
quality. The tree is slightly dwarfed for an avocado, is cold hardy, and bears 
moderately but consistently in Nov-Dec.</p> 
<p>++'Winter Mexican' (B type) is a Mexican x West Indies cross. Fruit is 
small (12-16 oz.) and oval with dark green, rough skin. The fruit quality is 
not as good as most of the other varieties we carry, thus it is not a 
recommended variety. The tree is large, attractive, and very frost hardy (to 
22&ordm; F). Bears productively Oct-Dec.</p>
