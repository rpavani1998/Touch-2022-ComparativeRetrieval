<h2>woodsmoke, working horses and farm&nbsp;walks</h2> Posted on October 31, 
2010 | 4 Comments <br>

<p>Going on a block course, I should know by now, is something of an epic 
journey. It&rsquo;s not just the railway stations and cycle panniers and 
hastily scribbled train timetable; racing down the platform as the train pulls 
in; squinting at the road signs through the rain; fidgeting in my seat scoffing 
apple buns made the night before; scanning the hills and hedges as they unfold 
beyond the train window. It&rsquo;s more about the journey in my brain; the 
experience of being away from the farm; learning about archetypes in bones, and 
about ruminant digestion, discussing the role of the cow in the farm organism, 
sketching sheep in the rain, exploring another farm and another farmer&rsquo;s 
vision, seeing a place for working horses in a world post peak oil, rubbing 
smoke out of my eyes as I light the stove each evening that will keep us warm 
through the night.</p> 
<p>So, it&rsquo;s been quite a week. In a way, it felt very gentle. The 
timetable was pretty relaxed, and we did a lot of farm visits and farm walks. 
In between we had some very informal presentations on different farm animals, 
looked at some pictures of digestive systems, and played around with some 
bones. I kind of felt like nothing mega was happening. But then by the end of 
the week I realised I&rsquo;d really learned a lot, and came away with a 
significantly expanded understanding of farms and animals and perhaps even of 
human evolution and social history and what it means to be alive.</p> 
<p>We all slept in a big old tent, a bit like sardines. There was a little 
woodburner, and some carpet on the floor. We found a huge pile of sheep skins 
and used them to sleep on. The first night was pretty chilly; we woke up with 
all the grass outside covered in crunchy frost. But after that the weather 
changed and it was warmer but damper. I was tremendously grateful to Fee for 
suggesting that I take a hot water bottle. I not only took that hot water 
bottle to bed with me every night, but also had it stuffed up my jumper during 
most of the classroom sessions, on my lap as I ate breakfast and supper, and at 
my feet when my toes got too cold. We had compost toilets, and a woodfired 
shower that no one used all week, and a big kitchen which was essentially a 
tent with a concrete floor, a big old wood fired oven in the middle, and some 
plumbed in sinks round the edges. It could have been terrible, but actually I 
felt really grateful for the opportunity to live outside for a few days; to be 
that much closer to nature, and weather, and light and dark. I like the 
simplicity of it and the realness. I missed it straight away coming home. I 
missed comfy chairs and the aga when I was there, but then coming back I missed 
air and space and the immediacy of nature.</p> 
<p>During the week we visited four different farms. And they were very 
different. One thing I really noticed was how clearly the personalities and 
characters of the owners or farmers shaped the nature and feeling of the farms. 
I was also really interested to see how each farm came together as a farm 
organism &ndash; how the number of sheep has to balance the number of cows, how 
the number of cows dictates the amount of silage you need to produce and store, 
how the dairy herd interacts with the beef herd, the connection between pigs 
and waste veg and whey from gardens and cheese making, and so on.</p> 
<p>Wharf Farm is Judy and Bert and their goats and ducks and dogs and chickens 
on a 10 acre smallholding. On first sight it could have been a junk yard, but 
it turned out to be a diverse and integrated smallholding where nothing gets 
wasted, the animals are well cared for, Judy makes cheese, and the people are 
part of the land. It felt jolly, earthy, homey and underpinned by surprising 
knowledge.</p> 
<p>Duchy Home Farm is Prince Charles&rsquo; 1,900 acre project, managed by 
David for 25 years (and counting) as a model organic farm with dairy, beef, 
sheep, arable, 50 acres of vegetables and 1,000 apple trees. They are 
self-sufficient in fodder and bedding for the animals, experimenting with 
working horses, and they like planting trees. It felt calm, purposeful, 
spacious, thriving, visionary and yet deeply rooted, and had a certain magic 
for me.</p> 
<p>At Abbey Home Farm they have, on 1,700 acres, just about everything you can 
think of: dairy, beef, sheep, chickens for table birds and chickens for eggs, 
vegetables, arable, cheese making, farm shop, cafe, fire wood and even a couple 
of Soil Association apprentices. And plans for all sorts more. It felt like the 
farm shop and cafe were at the heart of the enterprise, with everything else 
feeding in to the centre. It was busy and driven, big but well integrated, and 
good quality.</p> 
<p>Our last visit was to Watchoak Farm at Thornbury Camphill. It&rsquo;s a 
small farm, with chickens and turkeys scratching around the farm yard, goats 
for the children to stroke, pigs rooting up the leftover potatoes, and a 
complicated breeding programme for an apparently impressive little herd of 
dairy shorthorn cows. It was great to see the garden operating as part of the 
farm. Overall, it felt cared for though somewhat haphazard and chaotic, happily 
non-commercial, enthusiastic and passionate and very organic.</p> 
<p>After fire lighting and porridge eating, and shivering strip washing in a 
bowl of warm water, each morning started with drawing. We walked up the hill to 
Gables Farm with our pencils and sketchpads, and drew pictures of the sheep, 
cows, turkeys, horses and pigs we found there. Drawing is a wonderful way to 
force you to really look at something properly. I loved both getting a feel for 
the animals I was drawing (that rounded muscly-ness of the horses, the 
paradoxical wooliness and sharp alertness of the sheep), and looking really 
carefully at, for example, exactly how the horns come out of a cows head, or 
how the hooves fit on to a horse.</p> 
<p>In the classroom sessions (with my hot water bottle) we heard each others 
presentations on different farm animals, in varied styles and varied levels of 
skill and muddle. We learned about the special place of cows; their 
all-important digestive system, their dreamy nature, their horns, and lack of 
ego and their perfectly balanced manure. We found out about working horses and 
how they appeared really only quite briefly on the farming scene in between 
oxen (used for centuries to pull primarily wooden implements until iron and 
steel became cheap in the industrial revolution) and tractors (rapidly over 
taking everything since cheap oil and wartime engineering in the 1940s). We 
discussed what actually is a domestic animal, the unspecialised and child-like 
nature of both humans and our domestic animals, and some highly unusual ideas 
about evolution. We spent an afternoon doing bone puzzles; piecing together 
vertebrae, observing patterns, looking at skulls, playing with clay, and 
thinking about the archetypal threefold Viking realms of asgard, midgard and 
nifelheim.</p> 
<p>On Wednesday we spent an afternoon with Kai&rsquo;s working horses at 
Gables Farm. Flower and Violet; half sisters. Big and strong with huge shaggy 
hooves and massive muscles and round warm-air-blowing nostrils, and endless 
patient calm. We brushed them clean and learned how to throw a whole pile of 
heavy leather straps and buckles over their backs and then sort it out in to 
harness. We watched Kai come alive as he set off behind the horses, them 
listening intently, him calling and talking, guiding them easily through their 
work. Then each of us had a go at driving the horses. I stood still there 
behind them, reins in my hands, called out &lsquo;holdfast&rsquo; as 
instructed, and screwed up my nose as I failed to make any impression on them 
whatsoever. Kai says it&rsquo;s about projecting your ego and using your will. 
Eventually they set off at a surprisingly rapid pace and suddenly I was meant 
to be steering, in control, and wasn&rsquo;t really and went too far in to the 
fodder beet, and just about managed to turn round back in to the field and then 
was already finished and I was shaking slightly. I felt like I was useless, but 
that I&rsquo;d like to be good at it. We looked at the different implements for 
the horses (so much more interesting and meaningful than they could possibly 
have been a year ago), and talked about the benefits of working with horses 
over tractors (less compaction, wider window to get on the land, less 
aggressive machines, less pollution, and so on).</p> 
<p>In between all that we drank tea and ate biscuits and toast in extended tea 
breaks, walked up and down the steps through the steep woodland and along the 
sparkling valley to the mill, ate good lunches in the Ruskin Mill cafe, and 
shared our apprenticeship stories and plans and hopes and frustrations.</p> 
<p>On Friday I came home and felt a bit lost. I got so immersed in the place 
and a different rhythm, surrounded by other friendly apprentices, living so 
much more outside, in a world of thought and ideas and heady talking and 
farming visions. On the way home I got muddled and for a moment thought I was 
going back to Chesterfield, or might somehow find myself back in a tent on the 
edge of the woods in Gloucestershire and call that home. So then it felt quite 
strange to be back here, alone in my own room, with all those people gone, and 
the talking and ideas already turning to ghosts. On Saturday morning I walked 
round the garden to see what had happened while I&rsquo;d been away. Henning 
was in the garden all week, and you can see the difference. Somehow he really 
makes things happen. He&rsquo;s been muckspreading and rotavating and fixing 
electric fencing and harvesting potatoes and putting beetroot in clamps and 
making everyone turn up for work on time.</p> 
<p>It&rsquo;s great that all that stuff has been happening, but it also makes 
me feel really frustrated and almost helpless. I struggle for weeks and weeks 
to hold the garden together and keep the people on track and it&rsquo;s a 
really big deal and I know I&rsquo;m still not really doing it good or right. 
And then Henning turns up and he can instantly make everything happen so 
easily. And I just can&rsquo;t. And I want to learn how, and sometimes 
I&rsquo;m scared I&rsquo;ll never get it. I guess I won&rsquo;t ever get it 
like Henning does, because I&rsquo;m not Henning. But I have to find a way to 
do it all and still be me.</p> 
<p>So I went to have a look round the Long Crichel garden instead, and enjoyed 
the bike ride and ate a flapjack from the bakery there. Then I have been doing 
piles of washing and eating pumpkin pie, and sorted out my photos from the week 
(have a look at them), and had my first ever official supervision session with 
Claudia, and started typing up my notes from the course and swept and mopped 
the corridor. And did some work harvesting and hoeing and planting in the 
polytunnel because at least I can surely manage to make that good.</p> 
<p>Oh dear. What a ridiculously long blog that was. I did say it was an epic 
week though.</p>

<h2>cheese and&nbsp;seeds</h2> Posted on February 22, 2010 | Leave a comment 
<br> 
<p> I&rsquo;m going to try to write a short blog this week because as 
I&rsquo;m starting it&rsquo;s already 8:20pm on Monday evening, which means 
it&rsquo;s about an hour until my bedtime and in that time I&rsquo;ve still got 
to hang up my washing and check on the chicks and make a plan for tomorrow, as 
well as writing this blog.</p> 
<p>This week I&rsquo;m kind of in charge of the garden. It&rsquo;s one of 
Henning&rsquo;s new initiatives. Each of the three of me, Caspar and Duncan are 
now taking it in turns to be the person to organise the work in the garden for 
a week. I think it is quite a good idea for us all to take turns and understand 
everything better, but I like it best when Duncan&rsquo;s in charge like normal.
</p> 
<p>Our apprentice weekend at Plaw Hatch was really good. That&rsquo;s the 
reason why I didn&rsquo;t write my blog yesterday evening; we got home at about 
6:30pm, then had supper and did the washing up and unpacked and saw to the 
chicks and by then it was somehow 10pm. Anyway, I had a great weekend learning 
about cheese and cows and milk and yoghurt and everything else dairy-related. 
We made cheese on Saturday morning. It was very interesting and I was quite 
surprised to find out that it involved being up to our elbows in a big vat of 
warm milk that, after several hours, became a vat of rubbery white curds. The 
cheese we were making will be a cheddar, so it won&rsquo;t be ready for eating 
for at least three months. We also met the cows and calves, helped out with the 
milking, drew pictures of cows, did some cheese tasting, learned about how to 
make yoghurt and butter and keffir, and ate lots of delicious food. I was very 
pleasantly surprised to discover that I can still do hand milking, which I 
learned at Monkton Wyld when I was 18. They don&rsquo;t milk by hand at Plaw 
Hatch but there was at least one cow that needed starting off by hand because 
otherwise she doesn&rsquo;t let her milk down.</p> 
<p>Back at home, the chicks are doing fine and really growing up fast. They 
are much more bird-like now; before they were yellow and fluffy, and now they 
are beak and feathers and beady eyes. They are not at all so cute but they have 
more confidence and personality and curiosity. I now step inside their pen 
quite a lot; partly because it&rsquo;s bigger than it was and I now have to 
climb in to reach the food, but also because they are big enough that I 
don&rsquo;t have to be scared of standing on them by accident. Just in the last 
few days they have started getting balls of poo stuck on their toes, so 
I&rsquo;ve spent a while sitting in with them and picking balls off their toes. 
They squawk and struggle when I pick them up but when I put them down they sit 
on my hand, try to roost on my knees and peck at my bootlaces, so they 
can&rsquo;t be too badly traumatised. I think I need to put in clean straw more 
often to keep them cleaner, and I&rsquo;ve also just today extended their house 
again, so they have a bit more space to spread out. I took some photos during 
the week, so you can have a look if you haven&rsquo;t seen them already. They 
are three weeks old now.</p> 
<p>On the vegetable front there are some important developments. Today we 
harvested the very last of our carrots from Sunny Acres, and the very first of 
our baby chard and spinach leaves from the greenhouse. And sometime last week 
we harvested the last of our brussel sprouts and the first of our forcing 
chicory. The chicory isn&rsquo;t quite as big as it should be yet, but we 
wanted to make a start on it. We have also been sowing the first of our 
tomatoes and aubergines (my aubergine calculation: we have 2.5 beds for 
aubergines in the polytunnel; each bed is 15m long, with space for two rows per 
bed; the aubergines are at 45cm spacing in the rows; we have two varieties of 
aubergine; we&rsquo;re sowing them initially in seed trays so we can prick them 
out later; we sow them at about 50 seeds per tray; in the end we need 90 plants 
of each variety, so we sowed three seed trays of black beauty to be on the safe 
side, and we&rsquo;ll do the other variety in a couple of weeks time.)</p> 
<p>We&rsquo;ve been doing a lot of sowing and planting in the past week, which 
is partly because of the time of year and partly because there were several 
leaf days, which means it&rsquo;s a good day to sow and plant all the leafy 
crops like cabbage (two varieties &ndash; Derby Day and Chateaurenard), mizuna, 
rocket, corn salad, purslane, spring onions and such like. I direct sowed three 
lines of spring onions in the polytunnel in a bit of an experiment. One and a 
half lines I sowed with a special seed sowing machine we&rsquo;ve got (the 
brand is a German one called Wolf), and the other one and half lines I sowed by 
hand. The machine is meant to make it quick and easy and, I suppose, very 
regular because the seeds should fall out at a set rate as the wheel turns. But 
it took ages to figure out how to make it work, and then when I was using it I 
had the feeling that in practice the seeds were coming out somewhat 
erratically. So it will be interesting to see how the two techniques compare. 
On the same bed we sprinkled rock phosphate, which was a new experience for me. 
It&rsquo;s red powdery stuff that is about the same consistency as flour, and 
we were sprinkling it on the soil because the soil tests showed our phosphorus 
levels are low. Ideally you mix it in to compost and then it&rsquo;s more 
likely to be stabilised and in a form the plants can use. But it&rsquo;s okay 
to just sprinkle it on the soil and rake it in as well, apparently.</p> 
<p>We have had lots of deliveries in the past week, which has added to the 
feeling that things are happening and spring is on the way. Rolls of fleece and 
boxes of seeds and new buckets and bamboo poles and thermometers have all been 
appearing in the barn extension. I also had the most wonderful thought in the 
spring-like weather last week; I was in the polytunnel and suddenly realised 
that this summer I won&rsquo;t be sitting in an office. Of course I already 
knew that, but it really hit me that it&rsquo;s actually real and I am so happy 
to know that I&rsquo;m going to be outside working on the land instead of 
plugged in to a computer. Okay, it might also be horribly hot and I&rsquo;ll 
get sunburnt and it might rain all summer, and the plants will wilt and 
I&rsquo;ll have to go to bed when it&rsquo;s still daylight, but still, I think 
it will be better than being locked up in an office.</p>

<h2>cow identification and frozen soil&nbsp;samples</h2> Posted on January 3, 
2010 | 1 Comment <br>

<p>I am nearly a proper farmer this week. My jacket smells of cows, I have 
straw stuck in all my clothes, and baler twine sprouting out of my pockets. For 
an hour or so every morning and and afternoon this year (that is, for the past 
three days) I&rsquo;ve been working on the farm. In the morning all the cows 
come in to the yard, and some of them are milked and some of them have calves 
that they feed. My special job is looking after the little calves. We have six 
of them in four pens, and I have to let the mother cows in to the pens with 
their calves, feed the mothers with grain, &lsquo;bed up&rsquo; the pens with 
extra straw, top up the water and hay as necessary, and then get the mother 
cows out of the pens when the calves have finished feeding. After that I help 
Anke put some of the cows in to other stalls.</p> 
<p>It all sounds fairly straight forward, and I pretty much know what 
I&rsquo;m doing, but there is also quite a lot of scope for unwanted 
excitement. Most of the cows have got big horns on, and every time they shake 
their heads I can&rsquo;t help feeling that they could do rather a lot of 
damage without even trying. In the morning it is quite dark still at six 
o&rsquo;clock and the yard is icy and slippery, and I have to carry buckets of 
water and grain and bales of straw through a herd of curious cows, so you can 
imagine that it&rsquo;s not quite so straight forward as it sounds at 
first&hellip;</p> 
<p>Me and Anke have cow identifcation lessons every morning and afternoon, as 
we have to put the right cows in the right pens in the right order. They all 
have various distinguishing features, but it is taking us a while to get the 
hang of it. Laura has very upright horns, Gemma has curling round horns and is 
brown, Marie Pepper is fat and a dappled pink sort of colour, Marie Louise is 
white, but then so is Luna. Fortunately Markus is very patient with us when we 
keep getting them all muddled up, and will helpfully explain, when we ask which 
one Nerys is, that she&rsquo;s got four legs and a Welsh accent.</p> 
<p>I&rsquo;m enjoying helping on the farm and it&rsquo;s good to get a feel 
for how it works. I like the cows even though they are a bit scary, and I am 
slowly learning how to deal with them.</p> 
<p>In the garden things are very quiet. Nearly every one is still away on 
holiday, and there&rsquo;s no harvesting to do because there&rsquo;s no one 
much here to eat anything. I don&rsquo;t really have to do any work, but I have 
spent a few hours planting out some trays of rocket, mizuna, corn salad, 
purslane and radish seedlings in the greenhouse and polytunnel. On 
Henning&rsquo;s recommendation I&rsquo;ve covered them with fleece (even though 
they are inside) to protect them from the cold.</p> 
<p>A few days ago I did a little experiment that I originally learned in 
primary school. You dig up a little bit of soil, put it in a jam jar, add 
water, shake it up (with a lid on) and then leave it for a few hours. The soil 
settles out in to layers, so you can see the different proportions of sand, 
silt, clay and organic matter in your soil. I took some soil samples from 
various places around the vegetable fields and set up the experiment in the 
barn extension. It didn&rsquo;t quite work first time round, because all the 
water froze solid before the layers of soil could settle. I brought the jars 
inside the next day and now they are all lined up on the kitchen table. I can 
see some fairly subtle differences&nbsp; between the different areas of the 
garden, but basically we have got lots of sand and silt and it&rsquo;s all a 
grey-yellow-brown colour. In contrast the soil from the greenhouse is black and 
much more full of humus.</p> 
<p>Apart from learning about cows and pottering around in the garden, I have 
been baking bread (it makes so much sense with an aga in the kitchen, so I am 
teaching myself how to do sourdough), making and eating a vat of soup, helping 
finish off all the mince pies and stollen and vol au vents and such like, and 
(somewhat alarmingly) buying a new laptop (my old one has died quite 
conclusively this time I think &ndash; it won&rsquo;t even switch on any more).
</p> 
<p>For New Year I didn&rsquo;t manage to stay up late but Mellanie and Johanna 
kindly woke me up at midnight so I could drink a mug of orange juice with them 
in a befuddled state without even leaving my bed and then fall straight back 
asleep. On New Year&rsquo;s day we had a big brunch, and I did some tidying and 
cleaning and sorting in my room, and a big pile of washing, to start everything 
new and fresh. Which was good.</p> 
<p>This coming week we slowly start returning to the normal routine, as 
companions and co-workers and houseparents and employees come back from 
holidays over the next few days. It has been nice to have a break and some 
extra free time and lots of food over Christmas, but I do miss having everyone 
here and I think I&rsquo;ve had enough of mince pies until next year now. 
I&rsquo;m looking forward to&nbsp; having everyone back and starting the new 
year in earnest. I&rsquo;ve got to get a new diary though &ndash; according to 
mine the world ends tonight!</p>
