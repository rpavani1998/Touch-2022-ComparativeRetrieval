<h1>AVOCADO</h1> 
<h2><i>Persea</i> species</h2> 
<h2><i>Lauraceae</i></h2> <b>Common Name:</b> Avocado, Alligator Pear 
(English); Aguacate, Palta (Spanish)
<p> <b>Origin:</b> The avocado probably originated in southern Mexico but was 
cultivated from the Rio Grande to central Peru before the arrival of Europeans.
</p> 
<p> <b>Species:</b> Guatemalan (<i>Persea nubigena</i> var. <i>guatamalensis
</i> L. Wms.), Mexican (<i>P. americana</i> var. <i>drymifolia</i> Blake), West 
Indian (<i>P. americana</i> Mill. var. <i>americana</i>). Hybrid forms exist 
between all three types.</p> 
<p> <b>Related species:</b> Coyo (<i>Persea schiedeana</i> Nees), Anay (<i>
Beilschmiedia anay</i> Kosterm) </p> 
<p> <b>Adaptation:</b> Avocados do well in the mild-winter areas of 
California, Florida and Hawaii. Some hardier varieties can be grown in the 
cooler parts of northern and inland California and along the Gulf Coast. The 
northern limits in California is approximately Cape Mendocino and Red Bluff. 
Avocados do best some distance from ocean influence but are not adapted to the 
desert interior. West Indian varieties thrive in humid, tropical climates and 
freeze at or near 32&deg;&nbsp;F. Guatemalan types are native to cool, 
high-altitude tropics and are hardy 30 - 26&deg;&nbsp;F. Mexican types are 
native to dry subtropical plateaus and thrive in a Mediterranean climate. They 
are hardy 24 - 19&deg;&nbsp;F. Avocados need some protection from high winds 
which may break the branches. There are dwarf forms of avocados suitable for 
growing in containers. Avocados have been grown in California (Santa Barbara) 
since 1871.</p> 
<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2> <b>Growth Habit:</b> The avocado is a dense, evergreen 
tree, shedding many leaves in early spring. It is fast growing and can with age 
reach 80 feet, although usually less, and generally branches to form a broad 
tree. Some cultivars are columnar, others selected for nearly prostrate form. 
One cultivar makes a good espalier. Growth is in frequent flushes during warm 
weather in southern regions with only one long flush per year in cooler areas. 
Injury to branches causes a secretion of dulcitol, a white, powdery sugar, at 
scars. Roots are coarse and greedy and will raise pavement with age. Grafted 
plants normally produce fruit within one to two years compared to 8 - 20 years 
for seedlings.
<p> <b>Foliage:</b> Avocado leaves are alternate, glossy, elliptic and dark 
green with paler veins. They normally remain on the tree for 2 to 3&nbsp;years. 
The leaves of West Indian varieties are scentless, while Guatemalan types are 
rarely anise-scented and have medicinal use. The leaves of Mexican types have a 
pronounced anise scent when crushed. The leaves are high in oils and slow to 
compost and may collect in mounds beneath trees.</p> 
<p> <b>Flowers:</b> Avocado flowers appear in January - March before the first 
seasonal growth, in terminal panicles of 200 - 300 small yellow-green blooms. 
Each panicle will produce only one to three fruits. The flowers are perfect, 
but are either receptive to pollen in the morning and shed pollen the following 
afternoon (type A), or are receptive to pollen in the afternoon, and shed 
pollen the following morning (type B). About 5% of flowers are defective in 
form and sterile. Production is best with cross-pollination between types A and 
B. The flowers attract bees and hoverflies and pollination usually good except 
during cool weather. Off-season blooms may appear during the year and often set 
fruit. Some cultivars bloom and set fruit in alternate years.</p> 
<p> <b>Fruits:</b> West Indian type avocados produce enormous, smooth round, 
glossy green fruits that are low in oil and weigh up to 2&nbsp;pounds. 
Guatemalan types produce medium ovoid or pear-shaped, pebbled green fruits that 
turn blackish-green when ripe. The fruit of Mexican varieties are small (6 - 
10&nbsp;ounces) with paper-thin skins that turn glossy green or black when 
ripe. The flesh of avocados is deep green near the skin, becoming yellowish 
nearer the single large, inedible ovoid seed. The flesh is hard when harvested 
but softens to a buttery texture. Wind-caused abrasion can scar the skin, 
forming cracks which extend into the flesh. &quot;Cukes&quot; are seedless, 
pickle-shaped fruits. Off-season fruit should not be harvested with the main 
crop, but left on the tree to mature. Seeds may sprout within an avocado when 
it is over-mature, causing internal molds and breakdown. High in monosaturates, 
the oil content of avocados is second only to olives among fruits, and 
sometimes greater. Clinical feeding studies in humans have shown that avocado 
oil can reduce blood cholesterol.</p> 
<h2>CULTURE</h2> <b>Location:</b> Avocados will grow in shade and between 
buildings, but are productive only in full sun. The roots are highly 
competitive and will choke out nearby plants. The shade under the trees is too 
dense to garden under, and the constant litter can be annoying. In cooler areas 
plant the tree where it will receive sun during the winter. Give the tree 
plenty of room--up to 20&nbsp;feet. The avocado is not suitable for hedgerow, 
but two or three trees can be planted in a single large hole to save garden 
space and enhance pollination. At the beach or in windy inland canyons, provide 
a windbreak of some sort. Once established the avocado is a fairly tough tree. 
Indoor trees need low night temperatures to induce bloom. Container plants 
should be moved outdoors with care. Whitewashing the trunk or branches will 
prevent sunburn.
<p> <b>Soil:</b> Avocado trees like loose, decomposed granite or sandy loam 
best. They will not survive in locations with poor drainage. The trees grow 
well on hillsides and should never be planted in stream beds. They are tolerant 
of acid or alkaline soil. In containers use a planting mix combined with 
topsoil. Plastic containers should be avoided. It is also useful to plant the 
tub with annual flowers to reduce excess soil moisture and temperature. 
Container plants should be leached often to reduce salts.</p> 
<p> <b>Irrigation:</b> Avocado trees may not need irrigation during the winter 
rainy season, but watch for prolonged mid-winter dry spells. Over irrigation 
can induce root which is the most common cause of avocado failure. To test to 
see if irrigation is necessary, dig a hole 9&nbsp;inches deep and test the soil 
by squeezing. If it is moist (holds together), do not irrigate; if it crumbles 
in the hand, it may be watered. Watch soil moisture carefully at the end of the 
irrigating season. Never enter winter with wet soil. Avocados tolerate some 
salts, though they will show leaf tip burn and stunting of leaves. Deep 
irrigation will leach salt accumulation.</p> 
<p> <b>Fertilization:</b> Commence feeding of young trees after one year of 
growth, using a balanced fertilizer, four times yearly. Older trees benefit 
from feeding with nitrogenous fertilizer applied in late winter and early 
summer. Yellowed leaves (chlorosis) indicate iron deficiency. This can usually 
be corrected by a chelated foliar spray of trace elements containing iron. 
Mature trees often also show a zinc deficiency.</p> 
<p> <b>Frost Protection:</b> It is important to choose a cultivar that is 
hardy in your area. Mexican types are the best choice for colder regions. Plant 
above a slope for air drainage, or near the house for added protection. In 
youth, protect with rugs, towels and such spread overhead on a frame. For 
further protection heat with light bulbs and wrap the trunk with sponge foam. 
These measures also permit tender cultivars to become established in borderline 
locations; established trees are much hardier than young ones. The upper 
branches can also be top worked with hardy Mexican types, which will protect a 
more tender cultivar on lower branches, as well as serving as a pollinator. 
Harvest fruit before the frost season begins. Cold-damaged fruit turns black. 
Avocados are often in bloom at the time of frost and the flowers are killed, 
but the tree tends to rebloom. This is especially true of Mexican types.</p> 
<p> <b>Pruning:</b> Columnar cultivars require pinching at early age to form a 
rounded tree. Others need no training. Current orchard practice avoids staking. 
The best results are obtained by fencing the tree with plastic mesh for the 
first two to three years. Container and dwarf trees will need constant staking. 
The skirts of avocado trees are sometimes trimmed to discourage rodents, 
otherwise the trees are usually never pruned. Branches exposed to sun by 
defoliation are extraordinarily susceptible to sunburn and will surely die. 
Such branches should always be whitewashed. It is better to avoid any pruning. 
Most cultivars are ill-adapted to espalier. They are too vigorous. Avocado 
fruit is self-thinning.</p> 
<p> <b>Propagation:</b> Desired clonal rootstocks can be be propagated by a 
method known as the etiolation technique. The largest seed are planted in 
gallon cans and the seedlings are then grafted to a root rot tolerant clonal 
scion. When the stem of the graft reaches about 1/4&nbsp;inch in diameter, the 
top is cut off leaving a whorl of buds just above the graft. A 4&nbsp;inch band 
of black tar paper is formed into an extension of the can and filled with 
vermiculite and placed in a dark box with high temperature and humidity. When 
growth is some 3 - 4&nbsp;inches above the vermiculite, the plant is removed 
into the light where the upper portion quickly assumes a green color. The tar 
paper collar is removed, the shoot is severed from the seed and then placed in 
flats where the cuttings are rooted in the conventional manner. Any seed may 
also be used for rootstock, but Mexican types make the strongest growth and are 
the most often used. Plant cleaned seeds as soon as they are ripe. The seedling 
plants are ready to bud the following year. Budding is done in January, when 
suitable buds are available. Larger stocks are worked by bark grafts in the 
spring. Scions are collected Dec - Jan after the buds are well-formed. Paint 
and cover the graft with a moistened plastic bag and place a vented paper bag 
over the whole.</p> 
<p> <b>Pests and diseases:</b> Rats and squirrels will strip the fruit. 
Protect with tin trunk wraps. Leaf-rolling caterpillars (<i>Tortrix</i> and <i>
Amorbia</i>) may destroy branch terminals. Avocado Brown Mite can be controlled 
by powdered sulfur. Six-spotted Mite is very harmful; even a small population 
can cause massive leaf shedding. A miticide may be required if natural 
predators are absent. Snails can be a problem in California.</p> 
<p> Two fungi and one virus cause more damage than any pests. Dothiorella (<i>
Botryosphaeria ribis</i>) canker infects the trunk, causing dead patches that 
spreads to maturing fruit, causing darkened, rancid smelling spots in the 
flesh. Flesh injury begins after harvest and is impossible to detect on 
outside. Mexican types are immune to trunk cankers but the fruit is not. The 
disease is rampant near the coast and has no economical control. Root Rot (<i>
Phytophthora cinnamomi</i>) is a soil-borne fungus that infects many plants, 
including avocados. It is a major disease problem in California. Select 
disease-free, certified plants and avoid planting where avocados once grew or 
where soil drainage is poor. The disease is easily transported by equipment, 
tools and shoes from infected soils. Once a tree is infected (signs include 
yellowing and dropping leaves), there is little that can be done other than cut 
back on water. Sun Blotch is a viral disease that causes yellowed streaking of 
young stems, mottling and crinkling of new leaves and occasional deformation of 
the fruit. It also causes rectangular cracking and checking of the trunk, as if 
sunburned. It has no insect vector but is spread by use of infected scions, 
contaminated tools and roots grafted with adjacent trees. It is important to 
use virus-free propagating wood.</p> 
<p> <b>Harvest:</b> The time of harvest depends upon the variety. Commercial 
standards requires fruit to reach 8% oil content before harvesting. Mexican 
types ripen in 6 - 8&nbsp;months from bloom while Guatemalan types usually take 
12 - 18&nbsp;months. Fruits may continue enlarging on the tree even after 
maturity. Purple cultivars should be permitted to color fully before harvest. 
Guatemalan types can be stored firm, at 40 - 50&deg;&nbsp;F. for up to six 
weeks. Mexican types discolor quickly and require immediate consumption.</p> 
<p> <b>Miscellaneous:</b> Leaf and seed extracts have been used for a variety 
of medical application, including treatment of diarrhea and dysentery and as an 
antibiotic.</p>
