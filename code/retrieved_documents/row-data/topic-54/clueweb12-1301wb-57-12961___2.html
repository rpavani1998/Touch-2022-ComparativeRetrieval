<h2>Growing a Vegetable Garden With Limited Sunlight</h2> <br>
<br>

<p>by John Yazo</p> 
<p>Growing vegetables in the shade is not impossible. Planning and picking the 
right locations for your crops can provide you with a vegetable garden that 
will do just fine in the shade. Take advantage of the few sunny areas you have, 
choose the crops you grow carefully and you can even modify the shade areas to 
fit your gardening needs. With a little careful planning you will be surprised 
what you can grow in a partial shade area.</p> 
<p>There is no doubt that full sun areas are by far the best choice for 
growing a vegetable garden. Plants need the sun for photosynthesis and to 
produce sugar.</p> 
<p>To deal with shaded areas that you have to work with, you will first need 
to study the area, figure out how much sun and when those areas get sun, if 
any. Next figure out exactly what type of area it is, a partially sun or shade 
location is an area that receives two to six hours of sun, it can be either in 
the morning or in the afternoon. It can also refer to a full day of on and off 
sunlight. Most vegetables that prefer a full sun will grow in a partial shade 
area, especially if they receive the hours of full sunlight they need in the 
morning.</p> 
<p>A garden that is considered lightly shaded is one that receives an 
intermediate amount of shade. It can be one that receives only an hour or two 
of direct sun during the day, but bright enough for the rest of the day to 
allow for a variety of crops like leafy green plants such as lettuce, spinach 
or broccoli to perform well in.</p> 
<p>Full shade is an area that is usually found under mature trees that have 
dense foliage. Trees like large oaks and maples can cast this type of shade in 
the summer months. An Area that is heavily shaded under mature evergreens is 
often an area that is usually dry. A fully shaded area is a good location for 
woodland type plants and not a great place for vegetables.</p> 
<p>A shaded area does have it's benefits. Gardening in the shade can conserve 
water and weeds don't grow as quickly. Anyone who lives in an area with a lot 
of trees knows a shady garden can be a pleasant place to spend time working in 
on a hot summer day. Whatever the type of shade area you have in your yard, you 
can make the most of it.</p> 
<p>If you have a choice, choose an area that has morning sun. Shade in the 
afternoon will be better for your crops during the hot summer months, this is 
when the sun is it's most fierce. Severe temperature changes of shade in the 
morning and the hot blazing sun in the afternoon are difficult for most plants 
to handle. A gardens that faces east can benefit from the brightness of the sun 
in the morning and the shade in the afternoon. If your garden is in a location 
that is under deciduous trees, you can give your plants a head start by 
starting the seeds indoors or sow them directly into the garden early in the 
season before the trees form there leaves. The one thing about planting under 
trees is that the root system of the tree will compete with your garden plants 
for water and nutrients. Plants that are grown where there are trees will need 
extra care to make sure they receive the proper amount of water and nutrients 
to make up for there competition.</p> 
<p>If anyway possible get your garden out past the trees drip line, this is 
where most of the trees root system will end. If that isn't possible, you may 
be better off to plant in containers under the trees to prevent your crop from 
having to compete with them.</p> 
<p>Some of the vegetables that will tolerate shade, but should be planted in 
areas that will receive the most sun include beans, peas, potatoes, pumpkin, 
summer squash and early tomatoes. Crops like corn and peppers tend to not grow 
so well and produce modestly in partial shade.</p> 
<p>Crops that are grown for there root crops and leaves will tolerate more 
shade than fruit producing crops. Beets,broccoli, carrots, celery, 
lettuce,radishes,spinach,and turnips can be quite happy in partially shaded 
areas, along with shallots,onions, garlic, chives, leeks and parsley. Plants 
that produce leaves can tolerate a partial to light shaded area because there 
leaves have a larger area to absorb the sunlight they need. Shaded areas can 
have there benefits with leaf crops. They can be more tender and succulent, 
without having the bitter taste that they tend to get when temperatures get too 
hot.</p> 
<p>The one thing that you need to avoid when planting in a shade garden is 
crowding. Plants in the shade will spread out wider that when grown in full 
sun. Plant your crops wherever they will receive the most sunlight, even if you 
have to separate your crops in more than one location. Having smaller yields to 
harvest is better than not having any at all.</p> <br>
