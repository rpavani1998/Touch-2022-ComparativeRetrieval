<h1>London wrap-up</h1> 
<h4>by eisnero in Uncategorized</h4> No Comments <br>

<p>Reflecting back on my whirlwind tour of London&rsquo;s top coffee bars, 
it&rsquo;s clear that coffee culture in the city is still evolving, as it is in 
most places around the globe. It&rsquo;s also being widely embraced, as 
evidenced by the enthusiastic responses to my queries for suggestions.</p> 
<p>What also seems clear in reflection is that London has a preferred drink, 
and a style, all its own. The flat white was easily 75%+ of what I observed 
people ordering, although i admittedly observed the action largely in the 
mornings. (My own habits tend towards brewed coffee drinks in the morning, and 
an espresso or espresso-based beverage in the afternoon.)</p> 
<p>And the style was, well, sans tattoos.</p> 
<p>I can&rsquo;t finish this note without mentioning the places that I wanted 
to visit, but didn&rsquo;t get a chance to. Two of the places were recommended 
to me,&nbsp;Fernandez &amp; Wells&nbsp;and Kaffeine, the latter featuring the 
omnipresentSquare Mile Coffee beans. &nbsp;The last one I wanted to visit 
was&nbsp;Time Out&rsquo;s top coffee bar in London: Prufrock Coffee, run by 
&ldquo;2009 World Barista Champion&rdquo; Gwilym Davies. &nbsp;I didn&rsquo;t 
even know one could be a world champion at&hellip;barista-ing, but apparently 
it&rsquo;s possible, and this is the place to experience it.</p> 
<p>I look forward to returning soon and trying more places!</p>

<h1>Monmouth Coffee</h1> 
<h4>by eisnero in Chains, Retail, Uncategorized</h4> No Comments <br>

<p>My final visit (this trip) to London&rsquo;s premier coffee places was to 
Monmouth Coffee. &nbsp;Besides being top-ranked by a number of publications, 
including theTime Out London list, two of the three trusted individuals I 
polled individually cited Monmouth as being tops. &nbsp;Interestingly, both 
experts cited different locations as providing the best coffee; one cited the 
original Covent Garden location, and the other cited the Park Street location.
</p> 
<p>My visit was to the location in Covent Garden, and I was not disappointed. 
&nbsp;Typical of the smaller locations I saw in London, the layout showed off 
the coffee while still making room for a few tables in the back. &nbsp;Racks 
for makingbrewed coffee&nbsp;were prominently featured, something not present 
in the other locations I visited. &nbsp;I began by ordering a brewed coffee, 
and the woman taking the order whispered conspiratorially, &ldquo;normally I 
wouldn&rsquo;t say this, but everyone else is waiting for espresso drinks, why 
don&rsquo;t you scoot up towards the front of the line?&rdquo; &nbsp;Turns out, 
every other person in line had ordered acappuccino, flat white, or similar 
drink. &nbsp;I was pleased to observe thebarista deftly make my drink, and by 
the time I received it, the line for other drinks had advanced maybe 3 people.
</p> 
<p>The coffee itself was impressive. &nbsp;It had a depth of flavor I have 
observed in only the top tier of brewed coffees I&rsquo;ve tasted, not quite at 
the level of Blue Bottle but up there. &nbsp;A risk of sounding like a 
completely snobby jackass, the coffee was more complex and had a couple of 
different tastes throughout the drink, like a fine wine. &nbsp;I usually drink 
my brewed coffee with milk, and was pleased to find that the milk did not 
overshadow the coffee itself.</p> 
<p>I also had a cappuccino. &nbsp;I was again pleased by the coffee, and was 
intrigued to find that the milk was less foamed than with most cappuccinos; 
intentional or not, it was closer to a latte macchiato. &nbsp;Fortunately, this 
allowed me to enjoy the coffee more. &nbsp;I was joined at this point by a 
colleague, who gave me the &ldquo;eyebrow raise/cup raise&rdquo; look of 
approval.</p> 
<p>Because of the tables in the rear, the Covent Garden location seemed decent 
for whipping out the laptop. &nbsp;(Which I did not do.) &nbsp;There are also 
the standard wooden benches out front, but I would feel uncomfortable doing any 
work on them.</p> 
<p>I had a croissant, and can report that the baked goods are top-notch.</p>

<h1>The Espresso Room</h1> 
<h4>by eisnero in Uncategorized</h4> No Comments <br>

<p>I found my way to the unprepossessing coffee bar known as The Espresso Room
, and was at first taken aback: it&rsquo;s not really a room, it&rsquo;s 
actually the size of a generous walk-in closet. &nbsp;And that&rsquo;s 
including the benches out front. &nbsp;And the planters.</p> 
<p>But I was quickly won over by the coffee. &nbsp;I had both a flat white and 
anespresso, both presumably prepared with Square Mile beans, and both were 
quite good. &nbsp;In fact, I found the flat white to be superior to the 
previous day&rsquo;s beverage atMilk Bar. &nbsp;While I didn&rsquo;t have a 
chance to sample an espresso at Milk Bar, the eponymous espresso at the 
Espresso Room did come through.</p> 
<p>Additionally, the espresso came standard with a side cup of water. 
&nbsp;While I personally have a negative view of the tradition of bringing a 
water with your beverage (it implies to me that it will leave a bad taste that 
requires cleansing the palate), I am a sucker for that type of ritual.</p> 
<p>The miniscule size essentially eliminates any possibility of laptop-based 
work being done. &nbsp;Indeed, the hard wooden benches out front don&rsquo;t 
even make working on a mobile phone all that enjoyable. &nbsp;So it 
doesn&rsquo;t score very highly on my usual rating scale, but definitely a 
coffee destination worth finding.</p>

<h1>Milk Bar</h1> 
<h4>by eisnero in London</h4> 2 Comments <br>

<p>I inaugurated my London coffee perambulations with a visit to the widely 
known Milk Bar. Located in the Soho neighborhood, this tiny shop managed to 
impress me with both its coffee and food offerings. Slightly larger than most 
of the London coffee destinations I visited, it&rsquo;s also set up in such a 
way that the 8 or so tables don&rsquo;t feel too crowded, and this was an 
altogether fine place to begin my coffee tasting.</p> 
<p>Besides the obvious attention that they pay to their milk, the coffee was 
quite fine. Milk Bar seems to rely largely on beans from one of the top-tier 
British roasters,Square Mile Coffee. (I saw Square Mile-sourced coffees turn up 
at almost every location I tried.) I initiated my tasting with a flat white, 
which I think most visitors from the US would call a latte, and was rewarded 
with one of the best examples of this beverage I can recall. Smaller than most 
American lattes, and topped with very lightly foamed milk, the flat white at 
Milk Bar was milder than most espresso-based beverages yet retained a 
distinctive coffee flavor.</p> 
<p>A word about the milk: the milk itself was quite impressive, easily the 
richest milk I had in a coffee bar in London. In fact, it almost overpowered 
the coffee. This isn&rsquo;t necessarily a bad thing, rather it&rsquo;s a 
feature of the beverage and the store, but worth pointing out.</p> 
<p>A word, too, about the food: Since I was visiting over breakfast, I had the 
greek yogurt (yoghurt?) parfait, and am happy to report that this was, easily, 
the best breakfast I had on my trip. Made from scratch by the smiling and 
friendly cashier, every aspect of the dish was top-notch.</p> 
<p>Notably, while hardly a chain, the owners apparently have another location 
named, aptly,Flat White.</p>

<h1>Coffee in London</h1> 
<h4>by eisnero in Uncategorized</h4> No Comments <br>

<p>I just got back from spending most of this past week in London. 
&nbsp;Naturally, I was excited to check out the coffee scene in the capital of 
tea drinking.</p> 
<p>I prepared for the trip by diligently checking others existing top 10 
lists, like the one published byTime Out magazine. &nbsp;(I did not, however, 
download the aptly-named &ldquo;London&rsquo;s Best Coffee&rdquo; app; 
unfortunately, I only found out about it upon my return. &nbsp;Not that it 
would have done me much good; I&rsquo;m currently a Blackberry kind of guy, 
although I expect that to change in the near future.)</p> 
<p>It was a whirlwind tour of London&rsquo;s best coffee places, and a number 
of things stood out. &nbsp;First, the similar: in London, as in all the places 
I&rsquo;ve visited in the US, the staff is drawn from the same demographic. 
&nbsp;In fact, pull the baristas from any coffee shop in London, give them some 
tattoos &mdash; well, maybe more than just &ldquo;some&rdquo; &mdash; and 
they&rsquo;d be at home in any coffee shop in the US.</p> 
<p>The primacy of the bean was another similarity: most places I visited 
featured either bins or bags of beans, artfully displayed. &nbsp;Especially 
fair trade, organic beans&hellip;</p> 
<p>And of course there was plenty of La Marzocco and Chemex equipment in 
evidence.</p> 
<p>As for the differences, well, the people spoke funny. &nbsp;And the most 
common drink I saw being ordered was theFlat White, whereas in the US brewed 
coffee andcappuccinos predominate.</p> 
<p>But that was really it. &nbsp;The coffee culture appears to be virtually 
identical in the UK and the US, and I greatly enjoyed my sampling.</p> 
<p>I&rsquo;ll be posting my reviews over the next few days. &nbsp;Please feel 
free to suggest additional spots to visit, and I&rsquo;ll try to hit them on my 
next visit.</p> <br>
