<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Looking for a photographic destination of a lifetime? Well this is it! This 
photographic safari will be conducted in the east African country of Tanzania, 
home to the Serengeti National Park, the Ngorongoro Crater and Mount 
Kilimanjaro. It will combine an exciting photography workshop in one of the 
world's most outstanding wildlife, landscape and cultural locations together 
with a luxury vacation in fascinating Tanzania.<br>
<br>
Tanzania, south of 
Kenya on the African continent's Indian Ocean coastline, lays claim to the 
title Home of the Safari, since the word itself is taken from the Swahili word 
that means &quot;journey.&quot;<br>
<br>
While Tanzania's Kenyan neighbors may 
dispute that claim, there is no doubt that Tanzania offers one of the best 
environments in the world for an enriching wildlife experience. The country's 
game viewing opportunities are considered by many to be the best in Africa. Its 
game parks are populated with many of the world's most exotic creatures, 
including all of the &quot;Big Five.&quot;</p> <br>

<p> Its lakes are huge and bountiful with fish. Its cities are relaxed and 
friendly. Yet, to a greater degree than is true of many of its neighbors, this 
sprawling county, &nbsp;the largest in East Africa, remains untouched by the 
vacationing hordes.<br>
<br>
This tour will be very informal and fun. We will 
have discussion and assistance on specialized topics such as, for example, 
wildlife observation, field craft and east African animal behavior. This tour 
is about shooting. Lots of shooting. There will be no classroom sessions, no 
lectures, no slide shows, and most importantly, no unnecessary egos. We will 
all work closely together, sharing our knowledge and experience.<br>
<br>

Because of the unique location of this workshop, and the luxury accommodations, 
this workshop adventure is open to spouses as well as photographers. Even 
non-photographers will find the locales visited and the wildlife viewing 
opportunities to be thrilling. The cost for non-photographers is the same as 
for active participants.<br>
<br>
<strong>Day 1: </strong>Upon arrival in 
Arusha, you are met by our guides and transferred to the Kigongoni Lodge. 
Kigongoni Lodge is located on an historic 70-acre coffee farm near Arusha, amid 
natural forest. Sitting on a hilltop with lush gardens, the lodge offers 
breathtaking views of Mt Kilimanjaro and Mt Meru. Tucked between the trees are 
eighteen cottages, built in traditional African styles and materials. The 
rooms, cocktail lounge, and restaurant - all with fireplaces &#150; are 
furnished in an intimate and comfortable manner, maximizing the site&#146;s 
unique views and natural features.<br>
<br>
<strong>Day 2: </strong>Arusha to 
Serengeti National Park. You will awake to a new world this morning. Leaving 
your room and walking through the lush garden is a gentle reminder that you are 
now in Africa. Exotic birdcalls fill the air and hints of freshly brewed 
Tanzanian coffee mean that breakfast awaits you. After breakfast you&#146;ll be 
transferred to the airstrip for your 8am flight to the Serengeti. As soon as 
you land, you will meet your safari guides and begin wildlife viewing en route 
to camp, where you will have lunch followed by a safari briefing.<br>
<br>
Head 
out again this afternoon to continue your exploration of this world renowned 
ecosystem. You may see gazelle, wildebeest, zebra, giraffe, lion, hippo, 
buffalo and much more.<br>
<br>
Return to camp in time to refresh before your 
first dinner in the welcoming, open-sided dining room. After a delicious meal 
this evening you will have a chance to relax around a roaring campfire and fall 
asleep to the sound of nearby animals.<br>
<br>
<strong>Day 3: </strong>
Serengeti National Park. Today is your first morning in the bush. The sounds of 
buff-bellied warblers and African doves provide your gentle wake-up call. A 
hearty breakfast prepared by experienced chefs wakens your senses and prepares 
you for a full day of wildlife viewing.<br>
<br>
 After breakfast you&#146;ll 
have a full day to journey far and wide in this immense park, allowing your 
guide&#146;s unerring instincts to lead the way. An infinite number of dramas 
play themselves out on these endless plains: predators stalk prey, animals eat, 
scavenge and graze, mothers nurture their young, birds hover and soar overhead, 
young animals frolic as older animals keep a watchful eye on them&#133; in 
short, it is a story of life and death, decay and renewal and ultimately, 
survival of the fittest.<br>
<br>
 Take a packed breakfast with you to enjoy 
while you continue to explore the park. The vast open expanses of space, the 
multitude of animals inhabiting the pristine landscape, all of this will leave 
you in awe and impress even the most seasoned wildlife enthusiast. Lunch at the 
camp before venturing out in the afternoon to return to the camp in time to 
refresh before your evening meal.<br>
<br>
<strong>Day 4: </strong>Serengeti 
National Park. Today you have the option of joining a Serengeti balloon safari 
(additional fee and advance reservations required). The experience begins with 
an early rise (about 4am) and pre-dawn drive to the balloon launch site, where 
you will be given a balloon briefing prior to take-off. As the sun rises, you 
lift gently off the ground, enjoying a bird&#146;s eye perspective as you skim 
over the tops of acacia trees, meander over the Seronera River and finally 
touch down. You&#146;ll be greeted with a champagne toast and treated to a full 
English breakfast.</p> 
<p>For those who do not join the balloon ride this morning you&#146;ll awaken 
instead to the calls of the African dove or superb starling. As you sit 
comfortably on your verandah, sipping hot drinks and watching the day break, 
you may even spot giraffe or zebra grazing in the distance. You begin your 
quest to discover abundant and fascinating animal behavior in the park. Later 
this morning you&#146;ll all regroup to continue your wildlife viewing for the 
rest of the day, going back to the camp to enjoy a lunch before returning to 
the bush for more photography.<br>
<br>
Upon your return to camp late afternoon 
you can relax in the tranquility of your tent as you reflect on today&#146;s 
activities. Few travelers ever have the privilege of seeing, &#147;the world as 
it was in the beginning.&#148;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> <br>
<br>

<p>Under your dining tent, hot soup, fresh bread, entrees and dessert await 
your evening indulgence. Retire to your comfortable camp beds after a full and 
satisfying day.<br>
<br>
<strong>Day 5: </strong>Serengeti National Park. 
Spanning nearly 6,000 square miles, the Serengeti has even more to offer you 
today. For a new perspective on the scenery, you will move to a new location in 
the park. Arrive at Ndutu Safari Lodge in time to settle in and enjoy lunch 
before returning to your trusty safari vehicles for more exploration this 
afternoon. In the river systems that flow through the park you can spot hippos, 
kingfishers, egrets, monitor lizards and some of the largest crocodiles in 
Africa.<br>
<br>
 Out on the plains, you will be looking for warthog, jackal, 
eland, kudu, reedbuck, baboon, topi, hyena, gerenuk and giraffe. You may also 
see tightly grouped herds of wildebeest, which often gather together during 
their prolific calving season. Keep an eye open for newly born calves 
frolicking on the open plains.<br>
<br>
 Return to your lodge this afternoon. 
Enjoy engaging conversation around the crackling night fire this evening. As 
you gaze up at the stars over southern hemisphere, you will feel privileged to 
have experienced this special place.<br>
<br>
<strong>Day 6: </strong>Serengeti 
National Park. More wildlife viewing is on the agenda today. Meander through 
the wildlife-rich territories of the fertile Southern Serengeti plains.<br>
<br>
 Roll down the windows, or stand up to take advantage of the customized roof 
hatch, feeling the fresh air rush past as you navigate winding paths and secret 
trails in your pursuit of interesting wildlife sightings. With this 
perspective, you have unhindered 360&ordm; views, and the possibilities for 
what lies in store are endless!<br>
<br>
 Stop for a picnic lunch at your 
leisure and later today, after a wealth of opportunities for more wildlife 
photography, you&#146;ll return to the comforts of your lodge. Dinner is sure 
to be a lively, engaging affair as guests swap stories about all that you saw. 
Continue your conversation around the campfire tonight and then head off to bed 
for a good rest.<br>
<br>
<strong>Day 7: </strong>Serengeti National Park. 
Today you&#146;ll have another full day to the Serengeti. Begin with a very 
early start, with a 5 or 5:30am wake up call. Grab some coffee and a light 
snack so you can hit the road right at 6am, when driving is permitted in the 
park. Capture some phenomenal images in the pristine morning light. Later this 
morning you&#146;ll return to your lodge for an early lunch followed by a short 
afternoon repose.<br>
<br>
You&#146;ll head out again and will stay immersed in 
the bush until the last possible moment. After a busy day and delicious evening 
meal, head off to bed early to write in your safari journal and get a good 
night&#146;s rest.<br>
<br>
<strong>Day 8: </strong>Serengeti National Park 
/&nbsp;Ngorongoro Conservation Area via Olduvai Gorge. Rise early on your final 
morning in the Serengeti. Heading east, you&#146;ll arrive at Olduvai Gorge, an 
archeological site of extraordinary importance in our understanding of the 
origins of &#147;man.&#148; Here in these desolate gullies, several generations 
of the Leakey family toiled for decades in search of prehistoric clues in the 
mystery of human evolution. The small museum details some of their most 
important finds, among them the skull of &#147;Zinjanthropus Man&#148; and the 
3.6 million year old australopithecine footprints from nearby Laetoli.<br>
<br>

 Stop to enjoy a picnic lunch around noon, and then continue your gradual 
ascent into Ngorongoro Conservation Area. Your first glimpse of the Crater 
floor is nothing short of awe-inspiring. Make your way around the southern rim 
of the crater and arrive at your Nyumba, situated amongst picturesque flat-top 
acacia trees, in time to freshen up before visiting the nearby Maasai boma of 
Irkeepusi. Here you can catch a glimpse into the lives of these famed East 
African people. Learn about their history, culture and their pastoralist lives 
tending sheep, goats, and cattle.<br>
<br>
 Enjoy dinner at camp tonight in the 
cool night time air. Temps can dip down to 40-55&ordm; F; make sure to bring a 
fleece jacket and layer clothing while staying at the Crater. Sleep soundly 
tonight.<br>
</p> 
<p></p> 
<p><strong>Day 9: </strong>Ngorongoro Crater. Rise for breakfast before you 
spend a fully day exploring the crater floor. The area is world-renowned in its 
reputation and very small in its scale, so you will see other safari goers.<br>

<br>Don&#146;t let that distract you from the beauty of the place or from the 
fact that this remains one of the only places on earth where you may see all of 
the Big Five at once: Lion, Leopard, Bull Elephant, African Buffalo and Black 
Rhino. Enjoy a special boxed lunch today.<br>
<br>
Your journey will take you 
throughout this tremendous landscape that is constantly changing as animals 
move to and fro in search of pasture, water or east prey. This evening back at 
camp you&#146;ll have time to visit with friends before sitting down to a 
hearty meal.<br>
<br>
<strong>Day 10: </strong>Ngorongoro Crater. Wake up early 
this morning so you can have a few bites to eat and a hot cup of coffee before 
departing camp at 6am for the Crater floor. Maximize the light of the early 
morning and return to camp for a hearty lunch and a brief afternoon repose. 
Then you&#146;ll head to the Crater floor once again to capture the best 
afternoon light on film. Before sunset, it is time to depart this Garden of 
Eden for the comfort of your camp, where you will have time to discuss the 
multitude of sightings today and log them in your safari journal.</p> <br>
<br>

<p><strong>Day 11: </strong>Ngorongoro Crater to Arusha to Amsterdam. After 
breakfast you&#146;ll depart by road for Arusha. Arrive in time for a farewell 
lunch at River house with your new safari friends. Day rooms are provided for 
you to rest and relax before check-in at the airport tonight.<br>

Client Comments: &nbsp;</b>&quot;The internal flights in Tanzania 
could hardly have been better - punctual and with the expected level of 
service. The planned range of habitats visited provided opportunities for good 
photography of birds, mammals and nature. The guides at Ngorongoro and 
Serengeti were excellent. Tanzania is a very beautiful country and it was good 
to have had the opportunity to visit it using the local flights as this saved 
me a lot of driving time&quot;. M.D, Kent, New Hampshire.<br>
