<p><b>Commissioner hopefuls state</b></p> 
<p><b>their positions</b></p> 
<p><b>By Tom Carosello</b></p> 
<p><b>Staff Writer</b></p> 
<p>Election day is less than two weeks away - do you know each candidate's 
stance on the issues?</p> 
<p>To better inform local voters, The SUN recently asked Archuleta County 
Board of Commissioners candidates Nan Rowe, Robin Schiro and Ronnie Zaday to 
respond to a set of questions addressing four issues relevant to this year's 
race.</p> 
<p>Schiro and Rowe are vying for the District 1 board seat. Schiro, a 
Republican, defeated Republican incumbent Bill Downey in the Aug. 10 primary 
election, earning the right to face Rowe, an unaffiliated candidate.</p> 
<p>Zaday defeated fellow Republican and incumbent Alden Ecker for the District 
2 slot in the Aug. 10 primary, and since there is no unaffiliated or Democratic 
candidate on the general election ballot, in effect Zaday is running unopposed 
as commissioner-elect from District 2, needing just one vote Nov. 2 to secure 
her board seat.</p> 
<p>All agreed to participate in The SUN's forum. The following are the 
questions and the candidates' responses to each.</p> 
<p><b>County airport</b></p> 
<p>Question: With reference to county airport issues, do you view the 
potential reestablishment of an advisory committee similar to the former 
&quot;airport authority&quot; as a worthwhile venture? Why or why not?</p> 
<p>Zaday: Establishing advisory committees for the airport and for other 
issues that affect our county is imperative.</p> 
<p>These should be committees of concerned and involved citizens that would 
research and make recommendations to the board of county commissioners (BOCC).
</p> 
<p>The former &quot;airport authority&quot; made decisions, not 
recommendations regarding the airport; the decision-making needs to be made by 
an informed BOCC.</p> 
<p>Our county is fortunate to have the resource of many very talented people; 
many of these are retirees; some local and some from other areas with a vast 
array of experience at solving problems.</p> 
<p>Rather than &quot;recreating the wheel&quot; at every aspect of our county, 
I see several committees working closely with the BOCC to give recommendations 
and finding solutions to the issues.</p> 
<p>These committees need to include people that have experience and knowledge 
of the issues, as well as concerned citizens that have differing opinions, (to 
work with roads, transfer development rights, airport, Vision and planning, to 
name just a few).</p> 
<p>At the recent workshop regarding this issue, I asked that the advisory 
committee for the airport include not just all pilots or airport enthusiasts. I 
suggested that we find a committee member that is opposed to the airport to 
serve on this committee; I feel this would help to find solutions, and to look 
at the problems from different views.</p> 
<p>I also know that a committee needs to have a task or mission that states 
what the purpose is and a time line to work toward. This allows people to get 
involved and be part of the solutions, knowing what the task is before them; as 
opposed to being appointed to a committee for a term with no direction, that 
type of committee gets old fast, members lose interest and little is 
accomplished.</p> 
<p>Schiro: I am in favor of an airport advisory board to work with the board 
of county commissioners.</p> 
<p>I think there were problems with the makeup and level of empowerment with 
the previous &quot;airport authority.&quot; I believe the new advisory board 
should include airport users, business people from the community, and at least 
one of the BOCC commissioners as an ex-officio board member.</p> 
<p>This board would provide input to the BOCC. They could be chartered to 
provide input on issues such as growth, maintenance, safety, long-range 
planning and costs.</p> 
<p>As we have seen recently, inattention to the airport issues can be 
extremely expensive to the taxpayers of Archuleta County. This must be 
prevented in the future. I believe this comes from having balanced input from 
involved parties. </p> 
<p>We must maintain close communication with the Federal Aviation 
Administration and must be able to respond with fiscal responsibility to the 
users of the airport as well as the people we put in place to administer the 
airport and ultimately the public.</p> 
<p>By doing this, the airport would become a working part of our county rather 
than a side issue with expensive surprises.</p> 
<p>Rowe: I totally support the re-creation of a county airport advisory board 
to the board of county commissioners.</p> 
<p>Such an advisory board is clearly needed to apprise the county 
commissioners of the airport's ongoing activities and business, in order to 
enable the BOCC to formulate policy concerning the airport.</p> 
<p>I grew up as both the daughter and sister of U.S. Marine Corps fighter 
pilots, so I've been exposed, to a superficial degree, to the myriad complex 
issues that surround the aviation business.</p> 
<p>That nominal level of exposure revealed just enough knowledge to me to make 
me realize that a board of non-pilots, such as the board of county 
commissioners, is not qualified to make all decisions concerning our local 
airport without regular input from those who actually fly and are actively 
engaged in the operation of the airport. Such an advisory board would be a 
great asset for the board of county commissioners.</p> 
<p>But how these advisory board members are selected is also important. I 
would hope that the process would involve the submission of applications 
directly to the board of county commissioners, not to the airport manager or to 
the county administrator.</p> 
<p>The BOCC is ultimately responsible for the smooth operation of the airport, 
so they should also be responsible for the makeup of the advisory board.</p> 
<p><b>Road maintenance</b> </p> 
<p>Question: With regard to road maintenance, are you in favor of policies 
that encourage the private formation of local improvement/metro districts to 
shift some of the financial burden for maintenance away from the county? 
Explain why, or why not.</p> 
<p>Rowe: I certainly think the incoming board of county commissioners should 
explore more fully than have their predecessors the issues surrounding the 
formation of more local improvement or metro districts to handle road 
maintenance. </p> 
<p>But, right now, it's premature for me to be able to commit toward or away 
from this option until I've had an opportunity to more thoroughly research and 
consider whether any other options might also be feasible.</p> 
<p>I hope to create a new road advisory committee of informed and committed 
citizens to provide input to the board on all possible strategies for improving 
and maintaining our county's roads.</p> 
<p>Certainly, encouraging the formation of more local improvement and metro 
districts in the county is one option.</p> 
<p>But I'm not yet prepared to conclude that that's the only possible solution 
until I've had a chance to hear from some of our county's long-standing experts 
on the issue - both from within and outside the county government.</p> 
<p>This issue will be one of the first priorities for the new board's 
attention very soon after being seated in January.</p> 
<p>Zaday: I have spent a great deal of time over the past two months meeting 
with the public works department and getting informed of the &quot;real 
road&quot; situation.</p> 
<p>Public works is working diligently to compile the information necessary for 
the BOCC to make sound decisions in this area. Huge strides have been made 
since May in the analysis and inventory of our road system.</p> 
<p>I am not sure at this time that creating a handful of metro districts is 
cost effective to the county or to the taxpayers. There are less than 100 miles 
of roads that would be removed from the current county maintenance list and 
these roads are in several different areas. Creating metro districts involves 
costs, time and cooperation. I feel that we definitely need to have a citizen's 
advisory committee immediately to research the areas that might consider metro 
districts and get the information of costs and time involved to see if it would 
be proactive to consider this option.</p> 
<p>I feel that the current task before public works is to update the inventory 
which had been neglected over many years and to project the costs of bringing 
all roads into the system.</p> 
<p>The roads are the financial responsibility of the county and we have to 
make informed decisions as to how best to protect and promote our 
infrastructure.</p> 
<p>Answers to road questions in the past: &quot;there isn't enough money&quot; 
and &quot;we need to create metro districts&quot; have not been justified by an 
analysis of the information. </p> 
<p>This is an area that again I stress the need for a citizens advisory 
committee, to assist in the research and recommendations to the BOCC as well as 
to assist in the distribution of information to the public.</p> 
<p>Schiro: I am in favor of policies that encourage the private formation of 
local improvement/metro districts, but not to shift some of the financial 
burden for maintenance away from the county.</p> 
<p>Local improvement/metro districts could be used for non-county maintained 
roads as an option for those who want improvements faster than the county can 
provide them.</p> 
<p>There is certainly evidence that they can work effectively, as can be seen 
by successful programs already within the county.</p> 
<p>The county roads are a county financial responsibility. Taxpayers within 
the county are not getting the value in regard to road maintenance and 
improvement that they are already paying for.</p> 
<p>The county first must identify what the true costs are for road maintenance 
and then reduce ineffective spending.</p> 
<p>It is ridiculous to ask for, or expect more funding of any type, without 
first knowing what is currently being spent and where we can make cost-saving 
improvements.</p> 
<p>This must include looking at administrative costs versus direct costs used 
towards road improvement and maintenance and this includes fair pay for the 
operators, mechanics and first-line supervisors.</p> 
<p>Secondly, roads need to be identified and categorized correctly (not just 
taken off of the maintenance lists), so that we can accurately report and 
receive all of the funds due to the county from the highway users tax funds 
from the state that are due to us.</p> 
<p>Finally, after these actions are taken, and input from the residents of any 
particular areas are received, it may be useful and beneficial for these groups 
to utilize local improvement/metro districts.</p> 
<p>Roads are a complex and expensive issue for Archuleta County. It will take 
a blend of approaches to provide the level of roads that county residents 
deserve.</p> 
<p>I am confident my background, education, and experience will provide the 
best solutions to this problem. </p> 
<p><b>Land-use regulations</b> </p> 
<p>Question: Which of the following aspects of land-use regulation do you 
currently believe to be a higher priority for the county, and why - policies 
that focus on the preservation of open space, or policies that focus on 
protecting private-property rights?</p> 
<p>Schiro: To me this question is like asking the emergency doctor &quot;what 
is more important, to keep the patient breathing or to keep his heart 
beating?&quot;</p> 
<p>Archuleta County is a uniquely beautiful and attractive place to live. 
That's why most of us were drawn here, whether it was two years ago, 10 years 
ago, or two generations ago.</p> 
<p>And, just because we may have been fortunate to find this heaven on earth 
earlier rather then later, it doesn't give us a right to now close and lock the 
gate.</p> 
<p>The issues of open space and private-property rights are both critical, and 
must go hand-in-hand in order to manage our growth while protecting our 
wonderful quality of life.</p> 
<p>With growth virtually unavoidable, we must strive to place policies in 
place and utilize land-use regulations that will preserve the environmental 
quality and &quot;small-town&quot; atmosphere that we love.</p> 
<p>As we grow, open space will become more and more valuable in meeting this 
important objective. I believe the county commissioners must play a role in 
ensuring that the environment, scenery and life-style are protected.</p> 
<p>On the other side, this area of Colorado and the Southwest came into 
existence thanks to the hard work and perseverance of the early families that 
settled here. Many of these families still have descendents exhibiting this 
same spirit. </p> 
<p>We must respect this great tradition. Private-property rights must also be 
protected as we grow, as well as our environment.</p> 
<p>I believe my role as county commissioner will be to work to identify and 
maintain this delicate, but crucial balance. I will not sacrifice one for the 
other.</p> 
<p>Land-use and zoning regulations must be implemented and enforced that will 
give equal importance to both of these issues that are at the heart of what 
Archuleta County is all about.</p> 
<p>Rowe: Until very recently, the higher priority of the two posed has clearly 
been the protection of private property rights in Archuleta County.</p> 
<p>And with a very sparse population in our county, that was OK.</p> 
<p>But our population has grown so much that the absolute 
&quot;protection&quot; of private property rights has been eroding what is good 
for the community as a whole. And we are, indeed, a community. And, as such, we 
need to consider, and implement, what is good for the community as a whole.</p> 
<p>The viewpoint that private property rights completely and absolutely trump 
the rights of the surrounding community is epitomized by the plan to erect a 
massive &quot;Village&quot; up at Wolf Creek.</p> 
<p>The landowner and his developer contend that they have the ultimate right 
to build whatever - and as much - as they desire, simply because the parcel of 
land in question is privately owned.</p> 
<p>I strongly disagree with their position, and I'm extremely concerned about 
both the economic and environmental consequences to our community if their 
position is allowed to prevail.</p> 
<p>In my opinion, one of the linchpins of a community plan is the 
implementation of some form of zoning. </p> 
<p>Yes, zoning regulations restrict private property rights to varying 
degrees, depending upon the specific regulations in question.</p> 
<p>But the ultimate benefits to our community as a whole, I am convinced, will 
far outweigh the disadvantages.</p> 
<p>We need zoning in Archuleta County, and we need it now.</p> 
<p>Zaday: I believe that we need to look at the priority of both open space 
and private property rights. The current land use survey that is underway is 
very important in answering the questions of where our county is heading in 
protecting open space and private property rights.</p> 
<p>The performance-based code that will be established from the results of the 
survey helps us to protect private property rights under the Transfer of 
Development Rights Program, which encourages open space.</p> 
<p>We are currently facing many changes in our county and our land use 
regulations need to be set in place, to deal with the future on a long-term 
plan not just &quot;putting out the fires.&quot;</p> 
<p>Many of us love this area because of the openness and the vast beauty 
surrounding us. We need to set our plan for the future into place and develop 
our regulations to protect areas, while planning for the needs of affordable 
housing, senior housing, health, education, law enforcement and administration 
facilities, as well as parks and recreation.</p> 
<p>By setting the performance-based plan in place now, we encourage and create 
incentives for open space, while allowing flexibility for growth. I encourage 
each of you to fill out the survey online at www.archuleta.org or contact the 
planning department at 264-5851.</p> 
<p><b>Commissioner roles</b> </p> 
<p>Question: What do you believe to be the management roles of a commissioner 
with respect to the level of administrative oversight and 
communication/cooperation between county departments?</p> 
<p>Zaday: Communication and cooperation is one of the most important parts of 
running an effective and efficient county. Our county departments all work for 
each of you and it is absolutely necessary that the BOCC has administrative 
oversight, which means just that, OVERSIGHT.</p> 
<p>I am going to be informed of what is going on in all departments; however 
the actual day to day functions are why we have department heads. I will make 
sure that the best interest of the citizens of Archuleta County is being served 
by having qualified and capable people handling the jobs they are hired for.</p>
<p>The BOCC needs to have the confidence in them to deal with the day to day 
county business, while the BOCC is preparing for tomorrow.</p> 
<p>I am not a road maintenance operator, nor a solid waste specialist, nor 
vehicle registration specialist. You will not see me out fixing roads, planning 
landfills or supervising clerks. I will be finding ways to work with all of our 
departments, employees, and elected officials to find time saving and cost 
effective solutions to our issues.</p> 
<p>I will be involved in setting up better communications within our county, 
as well as with other entities, i.e., the town of Pagosa Springs, PAWS, Upper 
San Juan Health Service District, Pagosa Fire and School Districts as well as 
La Plata, Hinsdale, Mineral and Rio Grand counties.</p> 
<p>I believe assigning the tasks and monitoring the progress through 
communication is the best way that I can serve the citizens of Archuleta 
County. I believe communication with the citizens is the only way to create and 
know the public sentiment.</p> 
<p>Quoting Abraham Lincoln, &quot;In this and like communities, public 
sentiment is everything. With public sentiment, nothing can fail; without it 
nothing can succeed.&quot;</p> 
<p>Schiro: I believe the management role of commissioners should be one of 
providing strong leadership to the county administrative functions and county 
departments.</p> 
<p>By this I mean that they should provide a well-defined vision of the 
direction of Archuleta County and how we'll get there. There must also be a 
strong strategic plan with specific actions that must take place within a 
definite time-line to make sure that vision is achieved.</p> 
<p>All departments must define goals, establish action plans, submit reports, 
and conduct periodic reviews, while administering available resources 
effectively.</p> 
<p>Commissioners should establish clear policies and guidelines that will 
assist and not inhibit administrators and department heads in performing their 
jobs. The commissioners should lead the activities of the county under the 
vision, goals, and strategic plan they put in place.</p> 
<p>I am a firm believer that one of the biggest mistakes commissioners make is 
in trying to micro-manage the day-to-day functions of the county. Commissioners 
need to ensure that well-qualified people are hired, trained and supported.</p> 
<p>Then they need to allow those employees to perform their jobs while 
encouraging them, and providing oversight without unnecessary interference.</p> 
<p>It is also important that the commissioners do not relinquish their 
leadership role in identifying, approving, and carrying out the overall county 
plans. It should not be turned over to a single individual to act in their 
place.</p> 
<p>Department heads, elected officials and the county administrator, all 
should have defined responsibilities and authority to carry out the tasks 
necessary within their areas of expertise to accomplish what is needed.</p> 
<p>When communication breakdowns occur, I believe it is the role of the 
commissioners to step in and provide the leadership to pull the different areas 
together, break down any obstacles, and provide the appropriate resources to 
get things moving in the overall defined direction.</p> 
<p>Rowe: I don't believe the appropriate role of a county commissioner is 
&quot;management.&quot; It's policy making. </p> 
<p>The only county employee that should appropriately be managed by the board 
of county commissioners is the county administrator, because the board is the 
only entity to which the county administrator is accountable.</p> 
<p>The board's job is to make policy, and the county staff's job is to 
implement that policy. In implementing policy, county employees should be 
accountable to their department managers, not directly to the board of county 
commissioners. </p> 
<p>Department managers should be accountable to the county administrator, not 
directly to the board of county commissioners.</p> 
<p>To have any commissioner(s) attempting to manage the county staff would be 
redundant, demoralizing and counterproductive to the policy-making role that is 
appropriately the responsibility of the BOCC.</p> 
<p>Having said that, I want to make clear that my door would always be open to 
hearing from any individual county employee concerning work-related concerns or 
problems. But it's not input that I would actively seek out from employees - 
managerial or not, with the exception of the county administrator.</p> 
<p>With respect to the issue of &quot;communication/cooperation between county 
departments,&quot; certainly that is to be encouraged and facilitated however 
possible. </p> 
<p>If such communication and cooperation is not actually occurring among 
departments, the problems that stem from that lack of communication will, 
eventually, percolate all the way up to the board of county commissioners, who 
should ultimately be held responsible for the consequences - by the voters.</p>

<p><b>675 flu shots given in first countywide clinic; balance available 8-10 
a.m. Friday for others</b></p> 
<p><b>By Richard Walter</b></p> 
<p><b>Staff Writer</b></p> 
<p>&quot;The public was so cooperative, no one was turned away, and the 
volunteers were great.&quot;</p> 
<p>That was Susie Kleckner, director of the Pagosa Springs office of San Juan 
Basin Health Department, describing the four-hour flu vaccine clinic conducted 
Monday in the Pagosa Springs Community Center.</p> 
<p>Approximately 675 shots were administered, Kleckner said, and vaccine also 
was distributed for the patients in Pine Ridge Extended Care Nursing Home.</p> 
<p>Kleckner said the number of doses delivered leaves a short supply on hand.
</p> 
<p>It will be offered 8-10 a.m. Friday in the department offices at 502 S. 8th 
St., Pagosa Springs.</p> 
<p>The rules for distribution will be the same as those for Monday's mass 
clinic - only the at-risk population is eligible.</p> 
<p>That includes:</p> 
<p>- children ages 6 to 23 months;</p> 
<p>- adults 65 and older;</p> 
<p>- persons ages 2-64 with underlying chronic medical conditions;</p> 
<p>- all women who will be pregnant during influenza season;</p> 
<p>- children ages 6 months to 18 years who are on chronic aspirin therapy;</p>
<p>- health care workers with direct patient care; and</p> 
<p>- childcare providers and household contacts of children under 6 months of 
age.</p> 
<p>&quot;I'm just so proud of our community,&quot; Kleckner said. &quot;There 
were long lines and very few complaints. In fact, many people complimented us 
on the organization of the vaccine distribution process and the professionalism 
of those assisting us.&quot;</p> 
<p>The clinic resulted from a nationwide shortage of vaccine occurring after 
the product of an English firm, which was to provide 48 million doses, was 
found contaminated and all the product ruled not fit for use.</p> 
<p>All pre-planned local clinics were canceled and use of the community center 
optioned to create one mass inoculation center.</p> 
<p>Volunteers came from several organizations and dozens of individuals, from 
the local Mounted Ranger Troop, and even from several individuals and groups 
who donated cookies and doughnuts so those waiting in line would have 
sustenance.</p> 
<p>&quot;That's just the kind of community Pagosa is,&quot; said Kleckner. 
&quot;Everyone pulling together for the good of all.&quot;</p> 
<p>And while the remaining supply is small, there is a possibility more 
vaccine will be available down the line.</p> 
<p>The federal government is apportioning skimpy reserves on a &quot;most 
needed&quot; basis, but there were reports this week that Aventis-Pasteur, the 
lone American producer and the one from which Pagosa's supply came, may be able 
to produce millions more doses before the flu season reaches its peak.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p><b>Survey shows Pagosans like outdoor, simple life </b></p> 
<p><b>By Tess Noel Baker</b></p> 
<p><b>Staff Writer</b></p> 
<p>And the survey says &#138; protecting natural recreational opportunities 
like the Riverwalk, Reservoir Hill and open space is most important to local 
residents.</p> 
<p>In fact, a recent community survey in Pagosa Springs showed 85 percent of 
respondents ranked protecting the river corridor tops on the list of capital 
improvements for the future.</p> 
<p>That was followed by 81 percent highlighting open space acquisitions, 76 
percent choosing to assure public access along the river and 71 percent wanting 
to optimize recreational resources on Reservoir Hill.</p> 
<p>The next most-important items dealt with enjoyment of the natural 
amenities, including trails, parks and plazas. Of least importance among 
respondents was man-made features.</p> 
<p>As a general statement, 88 percent said future development, &quot;should 
respect Pagosa's established architectural scale, small-town character and 
historic identity.&quot;</p> 
<p>Those are just a smattering of the results gleaned from a summer-long 
survey of residents and visitors alike aimed at marketing, planning and the 
local economy and presented Thursday to members of the Pagosa Vision Council, a 
group of public and private representatives working to develop a downtown 
master plan recommendation.</p> 
<p>The community survey, commissioned by the town of Pagosa Springs and the 
vision council, was prepared and conducted by RRC Associates, of Boulder. Three 
different survey instruments were used. An &quot;intercept&quot; survey allowed 
for people to be randomly surveyed on the street and at special events. A total 
of 487 responded in this manner. Locals who were randomly stopped were asked to 
complete a longer, follow-up survey. A total of 51 locals randomly sampled also 
responded to the longer version.</p> 
<p>The longer survey was also made available online or in paper copy for 
people to voluntarily complete. The sample size for these self-selected 
respondents was 321.</p> 
<p>To test the quality of the random survey, income levels and ages of 
respondents were compared to income figures in the 2000 U.S. Census. Results 
showed the two were very similar.</p> 
<p>Angela Atkinson and Chris Cares, of RRC Associates, and Andy Knudtsen, of 
EPS, an economic consultant, presented the survey findings. Atkinson is a 
resident of Pagosa Springs.</p> 
<p>According to the survey, the average full-time Pagosa Springs resident is 
older, less affluent and family-oriented. Fifty-nine percent of respondents 
were over 45 with the average age at about 47. On the other end of the scale, 
just 20 percent of respondents were under age 34. One out of three reported 
incomes of $25,000 or less and families outnumbered other marital status 
categories.</p> 
<p>Part-time residents were analyzed separately for marketing purposes. 
According to Census data, 23 percent of homes in Archuleta County are inhabited 
for &quot;seasonal, recreational or occasional use.&quot; Second-homeowners who 
responded to Pagosa's survey proved to be older and more affluent than the 
full-time population, reporting average income levels of over $116,000 compared 
to average household income of about $49,000 among full-time residents. </p> 
<p>Summertime visitors to Pagosa Springs showed an average age of 48 and an 
average household income of about $81,000, higher than residents in both 
categories. Other visitor data collected showed 30 percent of visitor traffic 
in the summer comes to Pagosa from within Colorado. Texas, New Mexico, Arizona 
and California followed. The &quot;drive-in&quot; market, those within a 
200-mile radius, account for 27 percent of visitors. Texans and Californians 
stay the longest, on average about five days. Coloradans average just about one 
night.</p> 
<p>According to those visitors surveyed, the top downtown draws are the 
&quot;friendly atmosphere,&quot; &quot;the Riverwalk&quot; and &quot;events and 
festivals.&quot; Things visitors liked least were &quot;stores do not carry 
what I need,&quot; &quot;parking inconvenient/hard to find&quot; and &quot;too 
much traffic.&quot;</p> 
<p>The survey also looked at economic indicators for the community, such as 
&quot;leakage,&quot; dollars flowing to other communities - and the &quot;big 
box&quot; issue.</p> 
<p>According to survey findings, well over half of residents' monthly 
expenditures on clothing, household furnishings, automobiles, appliances and 
children's items are spent outside of Pagosa Springs.</p> 
<p>The least leakage occurred in the areas of groceries and personal care, 
prescriptions, hardware and building supplies, and entertainment and 
restaurants. Inflow, dollars coming into Pagosa from other communities, was not 
measured in this survey.</p> 
<p>As far as big box development of superstores goes, 59 percent of 
respondents &quot;don't support big box development under any 
circumstances,&quot; while another 30 percent would support it only with some 
sort of controls. This response was fairly even over all income levels. When 
comparing marital status, opposition to big boxes was stronger among singles 
and couples without children. </p> 
<p>Respondents were also asked what type of commercial development they would 
like to see in Pagosa. Tops on the list were small, independently-owned 
restaurants, more grocery stores, a conference/performing arts center, 
educational facilities and independently-owned retail stores.</p> 
<p>Atkinson said now that the survey was complete, the key would be to make it 
a &quot;living, dynamic document,&quot; used in developing marketing 
strategies, community consensus building and as a springboard for planning 
effects. As always, she said, any marketing attempts should including tracking 
results through future research to determine if efforts are successful.</p> 
<p>Knudtsen, the economic consultant, suggested Pagosa needed to continue to 
work to increase total personal income, focus on market potential to fill holes 
currently present in downtown as far as retail, restaurants and amenities and 
look to additional fiscal revenue sources.</p> 
<p>Pagosa's real advantage in the process, he said, was that community leaders 
were in a proactive mode instead of a reactionary one where people were already 
divided.</p> 
<p>&quot;Here I think you have an excellent opportunity where the community 
can come together ahead of time and chart the course,&quot; he said. The 
challenge is to balance between preserving the small-town character and 
constructing, &quot;capital improvements necessary to improve the 
experience,&quot; especially when people say that includes natural amenities 
and access.</p>

<p><b>Exploding ammo hampers firemen in Aspen Springs </b></p> 
<p><b>By Tess Noel Baker</b></p> 
<p><b>Staff Writer</b></p> 
<p>A fire in Aspen Springs Monday evening gutted part of a single-family home 
before it could be extinguished.</p> 
<p>Fire Chief Warren Grams said firefighters were called to 207 Oakridge Drive 
around 6:30 p.m. Monday. They were able to perform an interior attack on the 
blaze that contained major damage to the kitchen, dining room and living room.
</p> 
<p>&quot;The kitchen was completely destroyed,&quot; Grams said. Firefighters 
stopped the flames in the living room and dining room, however, the rest of the 
structure sustained heavy smoke and heat damage. Ammunition left in the house 
was exploding, making extinguishing the blaze a little more complicated.</p> 
<p>A total of 22 firefighters with five tankers, two engines and two support 
vehicles were on scene. </p> 
<p>No one was injured in the fire. Grams said the residents were not home at 
the time and food left behind on a hot stove apparently caused the blaze. A 
neighbor called 9-1-1. </p>

<p><b>Special ed count down in preschool, not districtwide </b></p> 
<p>Special education numbers districtwide are not down this year, as might 
have been indicated last week in school board coverage.</p> 
<p>Superintendent Duane Noggle said his comment on a decline from nine to four 
was in preschool special education, not K-12.</p> 
<p>&quot;Because our student count is so close this year to zero growth or 
even negative growth, we are watching even the smallest student count numbers, 
special education preschool included,&quot; he said.</p> 
<p>In fact, he said, the district is &quot;concerned with the huge growth in 
the number of high-needs students and that is why we added a teacher and an 
aide at the intermediate school.&quot;</p> 
<p>There has also been an increase in the number of high-needs students in the 
high school, he said. </p>

<p><b>Land-use survey response lags, more participants needed </b></p> 
<p><b>By Tom Carosello</b></p> 
<p><b>Staff Writer</b></p> 
<p>It's getting down to crunch time. </p> 
<p>They're three weeks into the process, and they've received nearly 200 
responses - but need a whole lot more before the deadline expires at 4 p.m., 
Nov. 5.</p> 
<p>According to Archuleta County Building and Planning Department staff, 
participation in a countywide survey that will be used to aid development of 
new county land-use regulations is in need of a boost.</p> 
<p>&quot;We're grateful to everyone who has completed the survey thus far, but 
we know we need quite a bit more, &quot; said Marcus Baker, associate county 
planner. &quot;We are still well short of the numbers required to validate the 
results.&quot;</p> 
<p>The survey, which requires an estimated 35-45 minutes to complete, asks 
residents to weigh in on a variety of crucial regulation issues that will be 
used to evaluate future development proposals within five proposed county 
&quot;planning districts.&quot;</p> 
<p>Early this month, the county completed a mass mailing of &quot;postcard 
reminders&quot; to boost survey participation and awareness levels, and current 
efforts include advertisements and press releases in the local media.</p> 
<p>However, as of Wednesday, the numbers of completed surveys returned to the 
planning department from residents within each proposed district were well 
below target levels. </p> 
<p>For example, results from the &quot;Southwest District,&quot; which 
includes the Arboles area, indicated only 6 percent of the required total of 
surveys from this district had been received by the planning department - at 
least 149 completed surveys are still needed.</p> 
<p>Likewise, numbers from the &quot;Southeast District,&quot; which includes 
Chromo and the Upper and Lower Blanco areas, showed a 12-percent total, meaning 
at least 122 additional surveys are needed from this district.</p> 
<p>At least 159 additional surveys are needed from the &quot;Northwest 
District,&quot; which includes the Aspen Springs and Chimney Rock areas. 
Results from this district indicate only 14 percent of the needed surveys have 
been submitted, to date. </p> 
<p>The minimum number of surveys still needed from the &quot;Northeast 
District,&quot; which includes the Holiday Acres and Loma Linda subdivisions, 
amounts to 149. The percentage of required surveys submitted from this district 
stands at just 19 percent.</p> 
<p>Results from the &quot;Pagosa Lakes District&quot; are more favorable, 
suggesting 54 percent of the needed number of surveys have been submitted. 
However, at least 90 additional completed surveys are still needed from this 
district.</p> 
<p>If totals still fall short of what is needed by planning staff at the 
deadline, &quot;We can definitely consider extending the deadline,&quot; said 
Baker. &quot;But only if we feel we can get more surveys by doing so.&quot;</p> 
<p>Baker indicated another option would be to hold public workshops within 
each district to publicize the survey process and evaluate the survey comments 
already received. </p> 
<p>&quot;I believe we could go to each district and say, 'OK, this is what 
we've got, but we still want you to tell us what you think so we can make this 
as valid and legitimate as possible,'&quot; said Baker.</p> 
<p>A similar workshop, aimed at providing additional survey information and 
addressing related questions, is set for Oct. 28, 7 p.m. inside the county 
Extension building. </p> 
<p>A third option, according to Baker, would be to consolidate the number of 
planning districts down to three if survey participation continues to lag.</p> 
<p>&quot;We'd like to keep the number of districts at four or five,&quot; said 
Baker. &quot;But if we don't get enough surveys, consolidating in order to 
arrive at valid numbers is a distinct possibility.&quot;</p> 
<p>In any case, said Baker, survey results will be implemented into the new 
code, but unless participation reaches minimum levels, survey feedback will not 
weigh as heavily as would be the case otherwise.</p> 
<p>&quot;The bottom line is, we are still going to write a new code even if we 
don't get the numbers back we're looking for,&quot; said Baker.</p> 
<p>&quot;But we think everyone would be a lot better off if they help us 
determine how to regulate their districts and keep as much guess work as 
possible out of the process,&quot; he concluded.</p> 
<p><b>How to participate</b> </p> 
<p>The survey is available for completion and submittal online at the county's 
Web site.</p> 
<p>In order to complete and submit the survey, residents should go to

<p><b>Trash container screening </b></p> 
<p><b>tiff pits resident vs. PLPOA </b></p> 
<p><b>By Richard Walter</b></p> 
<p><b>Staff Writer</b></p> 
<p>An otherwise fairly routine session of the Pagosa Lakes Property Owners 
Association board of directors was punctuated Oct. 14 by several confrontations 
with property owner George Esterly.</p> 
<p>The first came in the public comments portion when Esterly first thanked 
members of the board for serving in that capacity and then asked them to 
reconsider the board position regarding trash can screening.</p> 
<p>As addressed in the Property Owner Involvement and Input Initiative, he 
said, the board cannot be a change agent for covenants.</p> 
<p>Rather, he asked that the board work on one such covenant (7-1) which he 
feels should never have been deleted. He told the board it is his opinion no 
court gives the board permission to remove trash can screening.</p> 
<p>And, he said, he feels the purpose of the board is to enhance property 
values and asked that it commence proper enforcement, stating he feels the 
association is doing nothing to help the situation.</p> 
<p>When the board reached the Old Business portion of the agenda, the 
discussion returned to trash receptacle screening.</p> 
<p>David Bohl, board president, reviewed Resolutions 87-7 and 87-8 which 
removed the screening requirement for trash receptacles and propane tanks in 
July 1987.</p> 
<p>Director Fred Ebeling said inspectors do enforce if trash cans are left out 
in the street and Bohl said, as a general rule, the receptacles are put away 
because most residents are well aware of the bear problem.</p> 
<p>Esterly responded, referring to information packets he had distributed to 
the board that morning, that he had talked to area fire officials and they feel 
&quot;we can meet the codes and still screen propane tanks from view.&quot;</p> 
<p>Esterly believes the code deleted in 1987 needs to be reinstated to improve 
the area. He also said he has been informed the LP tank setback enforcement is 
the jurisdiction of the Department of Covenant Control and it needs to 
vigorously enforce the statute because the tanks &quot;distract from the total 
view of the home.&quot;</p> 
<p>Ebeling and Bohl replied the tanks are a &quot;fact of life&quot; in rural 
areas and &quot;when everyone has them, they aren't a distraction.&quot;</p> 
<p>When the board reached the recurring business section of the agenda, 
discussion of the Property Owner Involvement and Input Initiative produced 
another confrontation.</p> 
<p>Director Gerald Smith took exception to what he called Esterly's 
&quot;mischaracterization of the initiative&quot; and read into the record the 
preamble and summary thereof.</p> 
<p>He said that nowhere in it does it say the board will force changes of 
covenants or rules and regulations on property owners.</p> 
<p>Rather, he said, &quot;the board is trying to ascertain what the majority 
of the property owners want and to act on their wishes.&quot;</p> 
<p>In other action, the board:</p> 
<p>- heard a presentation from Fred Schmidt and Gene Tautges of San Juan Water 
Conservancy District regarding the upcoming mill levy ballot issue for purchase 
of a new reservoir site. Schmidt told the board the levy will be tied to 
purchase of the land and therefore won't be put into place for up to 10-15 
years, or until the property owner wants to close escrow. Director Ebeling's 
motion to have the association donate $50 toward defraying costs of advertising 
the issue died for lack of a second. Several other directors said they could 
not be sure their constituencies support the issue.</p> 
<p>- received a letter from a Village Lake family regarding the controversy 
over buoy line placement which will be forwarded to legal counsel for comment. 
The proposal would move the line from the last proposed route and would have a 
lock-and-key system to allow entry for property owners only.</p> 
<p>- learned three applicants have replied to board invitations for membership 
on the Environmental Control Committee. They have been invited to attend 
committee meetings to gain first-hand knowledge of its operations and if they 
wish to pursue their actions after such attendance their names will be 
submitted to the board for interviews and possible appointment.</p> 
<p>- heard a treasurer's report indication that, as of Sept. 30, $918,000 or 
91.1 percent of the total dues assessment of $1,008,000 has been collected, the 
rate of receipt 1.2 percent ahead of 2003.</p> 
<p>- heard an animal control report for September indicating two reports 
taken; four dogs impounded; one cat impounded; five dogs returned to owners; 
nine verbal warnings issued; three written warnings given; 17 miscellaneous 
citizen contacts made; and 14 calls from dispatch to animal control for service.

<p><b>Sobriety checkpoint planned </b></p> 
<p>The Pagosa Springs Police department, in conjunction with the Archuleta 
County Sheriff's Department and Colorado State Patrol will conduct a sobriety 
checkpoint Saturday, Oct. 30.</p> 
<p>Police Chief Don Volger said the checkpoint will be in the 800 block of San 
Juan Street (U.S. 160).</p> 
<p>National studies confirm that roadside checkpoints increase the perception 
of &quot;risk of apprehension&quot; thereby reducing the number of alcohol 
related traffic crashes.</p> 
<p>Local law enforcement authorities strongly encourage motorists not to drink 
and drive.</p>

<p><b>CU regent candidate overcomes rude welcome </b></p> 
<p><b>By Karl Isberg</b></p> 
<p><b>Staff Writer</b></p> 
<p>When Steve Bosley, candidate for a seat on the University of Colorado board 
of regents, finally made it over Wolf Creek Pass Friday, he was ready to stop 
in town for some campaigning.</p> 
<p>What he got was a rock to the head, tossed through the open window of his 
truck by an unidentified local youngster.</p> 
<p>Bosley was able to pull over at a local service station. Emergency Medical 
Services responded; Bosley's wound was bandaged and he carried on, heading for 
another in a series of last-minute visits to western Colorado towns and 
newspapers. </p> 
<p>The Boulder Republican is running for an at-large seat on the board against 
Democrat Jennifer Mello, who visited Pagosa Springs last month.</p> 
<p>Bosley was president of the former Bank of Boulder for 24 years during a 
35-year career in the banking and finance industry, but his most noted claim to 
fame is his role as founder of the world-famous Bolder Boulder, the fourth 
largest foot race in the U.S. He created the event and has staged it every 
Memorial Day for 25 years.</p> 
<p>Bosley has been married to his wife, Francie, for 40 years and has five 
children and nine grandchildren. A graduate of the University of Colorado, he 
received an honorary doctorate from the institution last May.</p> 
<p>Bosley claims he has &quot;the experience, qualifications, commitment and 
passion&quot; to help lead CU. He cites his skills in collaborative leadership 
and creative problem solving and highlights that he is &quot;an 
experience-toughened businessman who has the ability to understand large 
operations, complex budgets and organizations&quot; possessing &quot;the 
toughness, determination, fairness and &#138;wisdom to help make the right 
things happen.&quot;</p> 
<p>Those &quot;right things,&quot; says Bosley, include dealing with what he 
calls the &quot;perfect storm&quot; financial crisis created by the 
&quot;convergence of TABOR and Amendment 23. We are truly in a fiscal 
crisis,&quot; he says. &quot; State funding for higher education is at a level 
that now jeopardizes CU's ability to meet its responsibilities of its essential 
future economic role in the state.&quot;</p> 
<p>Bosley says he will take a &quot;proactive&quot; role to spread the word 
about the dire state of CU's financial health and, &quot;when the state's 
elected leaders agree upon a solution, to actively campaign statewide in 
support of the solution.&quot;</p> 
<p>He also believes the university must &quot;demonstrate it is not wasting 
the taxpayer's money.&quot; This can be done, says Bosley, by establishing 
&quot;a state of mind in which the regents, the administration, faculty and 
staff look for new ways to do anything and everything better, to reduce costs 
without cutting programs, faculty and salaries.&quot;</p> 
<p>In terms of changing CU's image as a party school, Bosley see things 
&quot;in simple terms. If you embarrass CU, you can't go to school here. 
Students will be treated like adults and will be held accountable for their 
actions.&quot;</p> 
<p>Bosley stands behind CU president Hoffman. &quot;She can't change the 
university's culture without an active and supportive board of regents.&quot;
</p> 
<p>The candidate indicates he is comfortable with the current system of 
electing regents - two at-large and one from each of Colorado's seven 
congressional districts.</p> 
<p>If elected, Bosley says he will make a maximum effort to stay in touch with 
the residents of Colorado. &quot;I believe passionately in realizing the 
potential of our children,&quot; he says. &quot;I created the Bolder Boulder 
Memorial Day Road Race for the sole purpose of serving the community. Now I 
want to take that same passion to contribute again, to help lead, revitalize 
and assure CU's stable future.</p> 
<p>&quot;CU has a critical role in the future economic vitality of our state 
and makes a significant positive economic impact on Colorado. CU develops 
competitive graduates for the industries that will drive Colorado's future 
prosperity, turns one dollar of state money into sixteen dollars in gross state 
product and returns more in Colorado taxes than is invested by the state.</p> 
<p>&quot;State funding for higher eduction is at a level that now jeopardizes 
CU's ability to meet its responsibilities and fulfill its essential and future 
economic roles. On the current path, CU will not have any public funding in 
less than a decade, I will help find innovative solutions, lobby for reform and 
coalesce the university's many constituencies.&quot;</p>

<p><b>Civic education isn't just for kids </b></p> 
<p><b>By Windsor Chacey</b></p> 
<p><b>Special to The SUN</b></p> 
<p>Civic education influences how knowledgeable citizens are, how attentive 
they are to public issues, how regularly they vote, how active they are in 
politics, how engaged they are in their communities, and how tolerant they are 
of the free expression of unpopular political views.</p> 
<p>There is a vital link between education and citizenship. All citizens, 
young and old, need to understand the political process - from issues and 
governmental procedures to the positions of individual candidates - in order to 
participate effectively. Citizens also need to believe their participation can 
influence policy-making and community decisions, and they need to act on that 
belief.</p> 
<p>Many institutions help to develop and shape our civic knowledge, skills, 
character and commitments. The family religious institutions, the media and 
community groups all exert important influences.</p> 
<p>Schools, however, bear a special and historic responsibility for the 
development of civic competence and responsibility. They provide education 
about the core democratic values that are embodied in our founding documents, 
which underlie our system of government. Education in civics and government is 
essential to the preservation and improvement of American constitutional 
democracy.</p> 
<p>The goal of civic education in the K-12 curriculum today should develop a 
common bond to unite people of different regions, religions, languages, ages 
and ethnicities. Each generation needs a deep understanding of the ideas within 
the Constitution, Bill of Rights, Federalist papers, and Declaration of 
Independence as a basis to help citizens resolve differences and address 
increasing complex policy issues.</p> 
<p>Civic education also ensures that people have the necessary knowledge, 
skills and character to play an active role in society and government.</p> 
<p>These Pagosa Springs/Archuleta County organizations are helping to ensure 
civic education in our county by volunteering their members to assist Kids 
Voting students at the polls Nov. 2 in the following precincts:</p> 
<p>1 - Kiwanis; 2 - Democratic Party; 3 - Archuleta County 4-H Program; 4 - 
Arboles, Mitch Appenzeller; 5 - Aspen Springs Community; 6 - League of Women 
Voters; 7 - Rotary; and 8 - Republican Women's Club.</p> 
<p>Constitutional democracy cannot accomplish its purposes unless its citizens 
participate thoughtfully in public affairs. Traits such as public involvement, 
civility, respect for law, critical thinking, and a willingness to negotiate 
and compromise are indispensable if the American form of self-government is to 
continue to succeed. Remember, take your kids to vote Tuesday, Nov. 2.</p>

<p><b>Special District Association cites Diane Bower </b></p> 
<p>Diane Bower, district manager of the Pagosa Fire Protection District, has 
been honored with the 2004 Distinguished Manager Award by the Special District 
Association of Colorado (SDA).</p> 
<p>SDA annually presents the Distinguished Board Member Award to a special 
district board member who has demonstrated outstanding leadership, dedication 
and service to their district. The award was presented at the SDA Annual Awards 
Luncheon, attended by more than 1,100 special district board members, managers 
and spouses.</p> 
<p>Bower has been a key figure in the district for 24 years. She began her 
career with the district when it was under the management of the Pagosa Lakes 
Property Owners Association and was hired as manager when the board decided the 
district needed its own administration.</p> 
<p>She has gotten the district on sound financial footing with a healthy 
reserve and a waiting list of potential firefighters.</p> 
<p>Pagosa Fire Protection District began as a 21 square-mile area and under 
Bower's supervision has grown to include over 180 square miles, including the 
town of Pagosa Springs.</p> 
<p>Bower has helped move the district from 15 volunteer firefighters to now 
over 75. She also initiated The Firehouse newsletter to provide a tool for 
communication with the taxpayers of the district.</p>

<p><b>United Way drive off to &quot;tremendous&quot; start </b></p> 
<p>The 2004 United Way of Southwest Colorado fund-raising campaign is off to a 
tremendous start with several events and Pace Setter campaigns already 
concluded.</p> 
<p>Over $182,000 has been raised toward the goal of $560,000. If the goal is 
reached, it will be the highest amount raised in United Way's history.</p> 
<p>In Archuleta County, over $14,000 has been donated toward the county goal 
of $62,000.</p> 
<p>Donations to United Way's work in Archuleta County support 15 local 
programs for children, youth, families and the elderly who are in need. This 
year's drive is led by campaign chairs Dick Babillis and Bonnie Masters.</p> 
<p>The United Way drive has seen some early successes. This year's Pace 
Setters (local businesses that run their campaigns in advance of most others) 
have raised over $49,000 for United Way and include all City Market stores, 
UPS, Wal-Mart in Cortez and Durango, XTO Energy, Bank of Colorado, Citizens 
State Bank in Cortez, Empire Electric, McDonald's in Cortez, and every United 
Way partner agency.</p> 
<p>Special events have generated nearly $78,000 to date. The Archuleta County 
golf tournament, sponsored by BootJack Ranch, netted $9,300 and the trail ride, 
supported by Matt Poma, doubled its total to $4,126.</p> 
<p>United Way works in Archuleta, Dolores, La Plata, Montezuma and San Juan 
Counties to solve each community's human problems. Community Investment 
volunteers in each county have already determined which nonprofit groups in 
their community are most worthy of donations to this year's fund-raising drive. 
After a thorough review in April, May and June, 31 nonprofit organizations in 
Southwest Colorado passed United Way's rigorous tests and were selected as 
partner agencies for 2005. Fifteen of these agencies are helping to solve 
problems people in Archuleta County are experiencing.</p> 
<p>United Way is currently working with over 100 local businesses to ask their 
employees to make a small, per-paycheck donation. Over 99 percent of donations 
stay in our community, with less than 1 percent paying dues to United Way of 
America.</p> 
<p>United Way's overhead rate is only 16 percent. </p> 
<p>Supporting businesses in Archuleta County include La Plata Electric 
Association, School District 50 Joint, Bank of the San Juans, Wells Fargo Bank, 
Citizens Bank of Pagosa Springs, Bank of Colorado, Old West Press and several 
others. Additionally, over 600 individuals in Archuleta County have been asked 
to lend their support to United Way's efforts.</p> 
<p>Tim Walsworth, President and CEO, said, &quot;The early success of the 
annual drive indicates to me that our community trusts United Way to solve 
local problems by investing their hard earned donations in the best nonprofit 
organizations. I'm very optimistic that United Way will raise its highest 
amount ever this year for people in need in southwest Colorado.&quot;</p> 
<p>Final 2004 campaign results will be announced in February at United Way's 
Campaign Celebration event.</p>

<p><b>Good results on first season elk hunt here </b></p> 
<p>Judging by reports from Colorado Division of Wildlife (DOW) biologists 
throughout the state, Colorado's first rifle elk season seemed to provide 
success rates equal to or better than last year.</p> 
<p>The one universal piece of hunting advice that DOW biologists are telling 
hunters who are looking to be successful during the second, third and fourth 
seasons is for them to get away from the roads and the major trails.</p> 
<p>&quot;Hunters who get out on foot or wait patiently on a vantage point tend 
to have the best chance to harvest an animal,&quot; said DOW biologist Chuck 
Wagner. &quot;ATVs are very useful for getting into the back country, but 
animals can hear someone approaching from a long ways away. Hunters who don't 
get out of their vehicle or off of their ATVs are seeing the sights, but very 
little else.&quot;</p> 
<p>Hunters should keep in mind that there are different rules for ATV use 
depending upon what agency controls the land. Hunters who use ATVs are also 
asked to be courteous to other hunters regardless of the rules in the area.</p> 
<p>&quot;Most animals shy away from any roads or ATV trails,&quot; said 
Wagner. &quot;Hunters should locate promising areas ahead of time and then plan 
on arriving well before first light in the morning, or be settled in on a stand 
several hours before dusk. Of the five bulls I saw harvested on opening day, 
only one was close enough to a trail to be brought out whole. The other four 
successful hunters had walked back in a ways and were boning out their animals 
in the field or using pack animals to retrieve their elk.&quot; </p> 
<p>Hunters with either-sex licenses need to be aware of the regulations. For 
the majority of these license holders, cows, calves and four-point bulls or 
larger are legal. Elk with spike antlers are not legal, except in a few Game 
Management Units (GMUs). Hunters need to be sure to identify their target 
before they shoot.</p> 
<p>Those who followed the rules and ventured off major roads and trails 
experienced a good first season in terms of hunter success.</p> 
<p><b>San Juan Basin</b></p> 
<p>&quot;The first season was good down here,&quot; said DOW biologist Scott 
Wait. &quot;Lots of bulls were harvested and there have been some good ones. It 
is indicative of the less than average bull harvest locally last year and the 
carryover to this year.&quot;</p> 
<p>Wait went on to report that there were no access problems and that many 
hunters reported bulls still bugling.</p> 
<p><b>San Luis Valley</b></p> 
<p>DOW biologist Chuck Wagner reports good elk hunting conditions in the San 
Luis Valley during the first season with some light precipitation keeping 
vegetation moist, making for decent stalking conditions. Hunting pressure was 
spotty with some areas nearly hunter free and others with many camps.</p> 
<p>&quot;Success appears to be fair to good overall, although there are hot 
spots experiencing a lot of harvest, and other areas where hunters are not 
encountering any elk,&quot; Wagner said.</p>

<p><b>Rampant development in the wilderness a threat to nature's balance </b>
</p> 
<p><b>By Chuck McGuire</b></p> 
<p><b>SUN Columnist</b></p> 
<p>It is autumn and the winds of change are sweeping over this great land of 
ours.</p> 
<p>The leaves of vast aspen stands, once ablaze with dazzling shades of gold 
and orange, are now the newest layer of duff on the forest floor. Black bears, 
which have been feeding frenetically for weeks, are fattening and will soon den 
for their long winter sleep. Meanwhile, migratory birds and waterfowl are 
gathering for another arduous journey south as the mule deer and elk have begun 
moving to lower winter range.</p> 
<p>It is autumn, and we recognize this seasonal shift in everything natural 
that surrounds us. We understand and anticipate such transformation and, in 
fact, have come to love it as part of the true glory in mountain living. But 
there are other, less apparent, changes in the landscape, which are not 
engendered by earthly movement or inherent biological function. Rather, they 
are human-caused, and seem motivated by self-absorbed materialism and a desire 
to accumulate wealth, at whatever the cost to our natural environment.</p> 
<p>I have lived a lifetime outdoors and, throughout, have witnessed the steady 
erosion of untouched places to a rising tide of human expansion and urban 
sprawl. The woodland where I ran free as a child is, today, a housing 
development, and the vacant lot nearby, where I played ball for hours on end, 
is now a large power generating station. The small and prolific creek, which 
served as a proving ground in my evolution as a flyfisherman, is presently 
flanked by row upon row of houses, hotels and condominiums, and their 
associated parking lots and trash containers. Even today, in a broad open 
meadow across the highway from home, a new road has just been cut where, for 
months over the past several winters, a large herd of elk has spent afternoons 
and evenings scraping through the snowpack to vital forage beneath.</p> 
<p>In many regions of the world, as human populations continually increase, so 
too does the demand for additional housing, related infrastructure, energy and 
essential services. Yet, while global society fails to embrace &quot;zero 
growth&quot; as a viable alternative to rampant expansion, the consequential 
strain on the environment, and the inevitable depletion of natural resources, 
will certainly bring our industrial civilization to a grinding halt. Many great 
philosophical minds of today, and earlier generations, have warned of this, and 
all agree, that only by establishing and maintaining balance between culture 
and nature, can man hope to survive another millennium.</p> 
<p>With this in mind, an argument can be made for controlled growth and 
responsible development, when it is necessary to sustain quality of human life. 
But as the signs are increasingly clear, ill-advised growth, merely for the 
sake of conquest or personal riches, is plainly not in society's best interest.
</p> 
<p>As I write this, there is a proposal before neighboring Mineral County 
officials and the United States Forest Service (USFS) which, if approved, will 
allow Leavell-McCombs Joint Venture, headed by Texas billionaire Red McCombs, 
to establish a high-density alpine metropolis adjacent to Wolf Creek Ski Area. 
As planned, it would include 1,200 hotel rooms, 222,000 square feet of 
commercial space (or the equivalent of 10 big-box stores), 129 single-family 
lots, and 1,643 multifamily units, all on 287.5 acres of private land 
surrounded by national forest. At build-out, the development would accommodate 
10,000 largely affluent residents, or roughly two-thirds the population of 
Durango.</p> 
<p>Bob Honts, a Texas real estate developer and president of The Village at 
Wolf Creek Development Corporation, claims nearby communities will benefit 
economically from the development, suggesting, &quot;A rising tide will lift 
all boats.&quot; However, in my experience as a past 19-year resident of Vail, 
Colorado, I am more inclined to compare such ventures with a rising storm 
surge, which typically inundates local inhabitants, often drowning them, or 
leaving them crying for help. To be sure, the only ones benefiting from such 
ill-conceived ideas are those spending the money and exercising the power 
necessary to drive them through the obviously inadequate approval system of 
local and federal governments.</p> 
<p>Another misguided enterprise even closer to home would give the 
publicly-owned 350-acre Job Corps site to a Midwestern developer in exchange 
for two distant private in-holdings of virtually half the total acreage and, in 
my opinion as a real estate appraiser, far less the value. Located a little 
more than two miles up Piedra Road on the right, the site now sits in the way 
of the developer's access to substantial property he's acquired adjacent to 
Stevens Reservoir, which he hopes to subdivide into numerous high-dollar 
residential lots. Currently, &quot;historic&quot; access is through private 
land, and deed-restricts development to as few as three residential lots.</p> 
<p>Of course, if the trade proposal submitted to the USFS is granted, the 
developer will have unrestricted access to his land, and will almost certainly 
develop it and the Job Corps site as well. While this will obviously be a 
considerable loss to the general public as a practical, and easily-accessible, 
year-round recreation site, it will also serve as yet another detriment to our 
coexistence with wildlife. According to a map in the Archuleta County Land Use 
Plan, the Job Corps site is apparently part of a major migratory route and 
&quot;severe&quot; winter range for deer and elk. </p> 
<p>These, and other disconcerting schemes presently emerging in and around 
Pagosa Springs, if allowed to proceed unabated, will indubitably result in 
higher living costs for us all, while diminishing recreational opportunities 
and the otherwise tranquil quality of life we know today. As said, responsible 
growth and development are not the issue, but we can no longer afford to turn a 
blind eye to those impetuous plans by out-of-state &quot;entrepreneurs,&quot; 
solely for the sake of making them large sums of money, without genuine concern 
for the well-being of the community overall.</p> 
<p>No doubt, there is true value in real estate, and its greatest fiscal 
return most often involves utilization at its highest and best use. But there 
are also certain &quot;intangible&quot; qualities associated with the landscape 
that simply cannot be defined in monetary terms. For instance, as we gaze upon 
a lofty snow-covered mountain range glowing in the afternoon sun, we can't help 
but marvel at the various shades of light and shadow which give depth and a 
sense of enormity to the scene.</p> 
<p>Or, if we should spot a bear foraging in its natural environment, we 
delight in its antics and appreciate the rarity of such encounters.</p> 
<p>Assessing the economic value of moments like these is impossible, but each 
of us knows the intangible values inherent in those experiences which move us 
emotionally, influence our happiness, and otherwise make life worthwhile. These 
are the feelings that overwhelm us as we behold the untouched pristine places 
of our natural surroundings. These feelings bring balance to our busy lives, 
and nature is why we're here.</p> 
<p>As Sigurd Olson once said, &quot;Nature is always in a state of 
equilibrium, and only when we manipulate it for our own purposes do we 
contribute toward imbalance. This could be the key to our problems. In our 
engrossment with material things, we do not fear or listen to the idea of 
inexhaustibility, but continue to pursue the goal of more affluence.&quot;</p> 
<p>The winds of change are sweeping over this great land of ours, but if we 
can turn indifference to legitimate concern, and if we can generate sincere 
political involvement among the ranks, then we can temper the force of the 
blow, and steer it in a direction of our choosing.</p>

<p> </p> <b>Letters</b> <b>Heroine, heroes </b> 
<p>Dear Editor:</p> 
<p>I'd like to take this opportunity to thank so many of the wonderful 
citizens of Pagosa Springs for helping my friend, Pam Richmond, and I get 
through a very scary ordeal.</p> 
<p>At 5:50 p.m., Tuesday, Oct. 5, we were victims of a violent crime outside 
of Alco. Two young men jumped us, threw my friend to the ground and tried to 
rob us. Pam had a front tooth broken off at the gum line and another broken in 
half. Along with a broken watch, her face, chest, knees, arms and hands were 
badly scratched and bruised.</p> 
<p>Citizens immediately came to our rescue. Bonnie Thrasher was the first 
person on the scene. She jumped from her car while dialing 911 on her cell 
phone and managed to engage in a foot pursuit of the suspects. She risked 
bodily injury to herself in an attempt to help us. She is a heroine in the 
truest sense of the word.</p> 
<p>The response time of the ambulance and police was amazingly quick. All of 
those wonderful people were angels of mercy.</p> 
<p>A local dentist met us at the clinic Tuesday evening. While he was working 
on Pam, a pharmacist graciously met me after hours at the pharmacy to provide 
pain medication to help her get through the next few hours a little more 
comfortably.</p> 
<p>These two wonderful men went above and beyond and truly exhibited the 
spirit of Pagosa. I'd also like to offer a heart felt thank you to local 
physicians for being so attentive and thorough with Pam on Wednesday. You did 
as much for her spirit as her body. Thank you.</p> 
<p>Troubled youth are a nationwide problem. As a 30-year educator who watched 
a tiny community evolve into an overpopulated suburb, and a person who has 
lived with &quot;big city crime,&quot; it would be my sincerest wish that the 
responsible youth, church directors, schools, police, senior citizens and 
parents of Pagosa will act in tandem and recognize that Pagosa's youth may need 
more attention. Something good is happening, that was apparent from the 
wonderful response Pam and I received during our crisis.</p> 
<p>While growth is economically good for a community, unforeseen problems can 
taint the splendor of it. Growth is a multifaceted situation that has a domino 
effect on every member of the population. It truly does &quot;take a village to 
raise a child&quot; and therefore it takes effort from every citizen to avoid 
the pitfalls that can wreak havoc on its citizens. Popular after-school 
programs, updating and redefining new and more aggressive drug programs, and 
more city and church sponsored &quot;family oriented&quot; activities are just 
a few of the things that can help young people successfully navigate their way 
to adulthood.</p> 
<p>I'm hopeful that our tragedy can help to inspire more to be done to keep 
every child from getting lost to a life of crime. Our children are such a 
precious commodity.</p> 
<p>With loving support for Pagosa Springs and the new place I love to call 
&quot;home.&quot;</p>

<p><b>&nbsp;</b><b>Environment woe</b></p> 
<p>Dear Editor:</p> 
<p>We really don't know which of the presidential candidates will make America 
a safer place to live, but we have a very clear choice on the environment.</p> 
<p>Don't think the environment is important? You should. According to a recent 
report, at least 80 percent of all cancer cases are linked to environmental 
causes. These are independent of those caused by lifestyle, i.e. smoking, etc.
</p> 
<p>As president, George W. Bush has a terrible record on environmental issues. 
For instance, his &quot;clear skies&quot; initiative would allow 300 percent 
more mercury emissions into our air and water over existing rules. One in six 
women already has enough mercury in her body to risk brain damage, mental 
retardation, blindness, seizures and speech impediments in her child.</p> 
<p>John Kerry has an excellent record in the Senate on voting for the 
environment. Now I don't expect anyone's going to change their vote based on 
this letter, but if GWB is reelected you might think about writing, e-mailing 
or calling the White House and asking him to stop relaxing environmental 
standards.</p> 
<p>Other than leaving the world a safer place, what could be more important 
than leaving a cleaner, more healthy planet for our children and grandchildren?

<p>Denny Bell</p> 
<p><b>&nbsp;</b><b>Truth ignored</b></p> 
<p>Dear Editor:</p> 
<p>As a living historian, I find it fascinating how often history repeats 
itself.</p> 
<p>Today, as we watch this presidential election process unfold, it is 
interesting the similarities of one event in America's fight for independence 
to the record of one of today's presidential candidates.</p> 
<p>Let us consider the enigma of Benedict Arnold and John Kerry. Arnold who 
was an ardent patriot at the beginning of America's fight for independence, 
soon became disenchanted with the effort, as his personal ambition for power 
and success was not meeting his expectations. Brash, arrogant and brave to the 
degree that he was willing to risk not only his own life but the lives of those 
under his command, Arnold became immediately a &quot;hero&quot; with the defeat 
of the British at Fort Ticonderoga. Following successes gained him promotions 
to the rank of Major General and great favor with General George Washington.</p>
<p>But Congress and other commanders saw him as arrogant, insubordinate, and 
reckless. Arnold was given command of West Point in 1780 but immediately began 
to conspire with Lord Henry Clinton, (I'm not making it up), to hand over its 
3,000 defenders and the fort for 20,000 pounds sterling, (about $1 million in 
today's currency). His plan discovered, Arnold escaped and later led 
devastating attacks against colonial forces.</p> 
<p>Arnold, a military hero for both sides in the same war, seems to be a near 
perfect foreshadow of John Kerry.</p> 
<p>&quot;Decorated war hero,&quot; Kerry, having returned from the Vietnam, 
immediately began to conspire with the North Viet Nam Communists and Viet Cong. 
Kerry's treason was as Arnold's, not of a principled man but rather that of a 
selfish and ambitious one.</p> 
<p>Kerry has repeatedly pointed to his war record as a hero for a lost cause 
in Vietnam, but has ignored the truth that his very actions after his service 
helped to bring about the eventual defeat of American forces and the murder of 
more than one million &quot;undesirables&quot; when the Communists took over 
the south.</p> 
<p>Today, Kerry's photo is proudly displayed in the Communist war museum in Ho 
Chi Minh City, Vietnam, as a hero for the Communist cause in the war against 
America. Kerry has accomplished what Arnold did, by becoming a hero for both 
sides in the same war.</p> 
<p>One can only imagine what could happen if Kerry becomes president. 
Americans in 1780 would have rewarded the treasonous Arnold with a hangman's 
noose. Today we would have made him senator or president.</p> 
<p>God help us.</p> 
<p>William Bennett</p> 
<p><b>&nbsp;</b><b>Words distort</b></p> 
<p>Dear Editor:</p> 
<p>Those of us who watched the presidential debates witnessed how words can be 
used to evade questions and distort actual fact. Like a tennis player who tries 
to slam or spin the ball in hopes his opponent will fail to return it, words 
are used to attack or put a creative spin on reality in the hopes the speaker 
will look good and his opponent off balance and out of sync.</p> 
<p>Now, who comes to town but a slick promoter who uses words to create an 
illusion of reality. He is the ultimate medicine man pulling his wagon full of 
magic elixir that, he promises, will cure destitution, loneliness, complacency, 
isolation, economic hardship, as well as a general feeling of being out of 
touch.</p> 
<p>With buttery words from his honey tongue, he mesmerizes his audience with 
promises of wonderment. Almost hypnotized, I feel drawn closer to his wagon to 
better hear and maybe even obtain a bottle. I feel myself transported to the 
sea and being rocked gently in a boat that is rising with tide along with all 
the other boats.</p> 
<p>But then suddenly someone grabs my ear pinching hard. It hurts dreadfully 
and I'm confused. I look and see my father. I see him talking to me but I can't 
hear him. And then the sound comes loud. He's shouting, &quot;He stole those 
words from Franklin Delano Roosevelt, son. You live in the mountains, not by 
the ocean. This rising tide will flood the land and drive us from our home. 
Wake up! Wake up!&quot;</p> 
<p>I feel myself shaken, gently shaken. From far away I hear, &quot;Wake up, 
dear. Time to get up.&quot; This time I open my eyes and see my mother smiling 
at me. &quot;You must have been dreaming,&quot; she says.</p> 
<p>It's time for all of us to awake from our slumber and look with sober eyes 
on the world before us.</p> 
<p>Bob Honts is the quintessential, smooth-spoken snake oil salesman. Now is 
the time to quit with the words and drive his show wagon from our town. 
Shooting an arrow in his butt sounds revolting but I'm all for giving him a 
good old-fashioned American punch in the nose ... figuratively speaking.</p>

<p><b>&nbsp;</b><b>Reasons to vote</b></p> 
<p>Dear Editor:</p> 
<p>In 32 years of living in Archuleta County, we've known a few lucky people 
who came here for a good job. Probably all of us value job creation, a higher 
minimum wage and equal pay for equivalent job performance, but it probably 
didn't drive our decision to live in Pagosa.</p> 
<p>In those same 32 years, we know of no one who moved here for extraordinary 
health care or health care benefits. We have fine medical practitioners, but 
most of us struggle to obtain or maintain adequate catastrophic care insurance 
or a cash reserve to meet unexpected medical bills.</p> 
<p>So, why do people move to the Pagosa area? Because of the natural beauty 
and the extensive protected lands of our National Forest. If these are your 
reasons for living here, you have two compelling reasons to elect Democrats 
Nov. 2 or by voting early.</p> 
<p>No prior federal administration has gone to the extremes that the current 
one has to invade delicate public lands for the short-term benefit of oil and 
gas companies.</p> 
<p>The Bush administration has refused to reinstate the Superfund tax to make 
polluters pay for toxic waste site cleanup. It has relaxed key regulation in 
the Clean Air Act and has sought funding cuts for the Clean Water Act. It 
embraces proposals to reduce protection of federal wetlands. All this for the 
benefit of companies which don't care about the values we share in Archuleta 
County. Please consider your vote carefully. Remember why you moved here.</p>

<p>With growth of population in Pagosa and Archuleta County you are certainly 
counting climbing numbers of scurrilous and rapacious individuals. I was camped 
out at Kenney Flats and had property stolen from my camp this week.</p> 
<p>I see a lot of unlawful activity going on in town and out in far reaches of 
the county and I suppose law enforcement people are far outnumbered. I spoke 
with citizens who are discouraged with complaints of situations that allegedly 
are not being investigated or addressed.</p> 
<p>I was driving up Put Hill and slowed down a bit in the 45 mph zone because 
of construction project and had a citizen shake his fist and flip me the bird 
because, I guess, I impeded his journey. To him, 45 meant 54. I think Pagosa is 
being flooded with dyslexic people or people are coming here who are used to 
California-style driving.</p> 
<p>Yeah, I lived in California at one time, too. Arnie can have it. </p> 
<p>I don't know what it is with people driving like a bat out of you know 
where, and speeding right straight to the doctor, the mortuary, or to pay a 
fine.</p> 
<p>Whatever happened to our sleepy little town when I sat in the police car at 
3 a.m. and saw only an occasional dog out looking for something to eat or an 
occasional skunk?</p> 
<p>Progress, you say?</p> 
<p>Perhaps I write from the viewpoint of a curmudgeon because I am certainly 
one of those who has no tolerance for scurrilous behavior. I'm sure Chief 
Volger remembers I did what I did to keep our town in control and the crooks in 
jail.</p> 
<p>Curmudgery has not come easy to me or without knocks. But I have a lot of 
stories, praise and wonderful memories of the pathways and efforts of guys like 
Bill Downey, Herb Browning, Judd Cooney, Tom Richards, Roy Vega, Ernie Rivas 
and many, many other fine officers of the law who, together and cohesively, 
kept the town and county under control and the crooks on the run.</p> 
<p>For Pagosa Springs, I have this to say: God bless you and keep you safe and 
secure from the evil that is filtering in with all the good.</p>

<p><b>&nbsp;</b><b>Pillage village</b></p> 
<p>Dear Editor:</p> 
<p>How is 1,200 rooms in three hotels, 129 lots for single-family homes, 1,661 
multifamily units, 4,525 covered parking spaces, 222,000 square feet of 
commercial space - and a population of 10,000 year-round at an ultra-exclusive 
resort on 297 acres a good thing?</p> 
<p>Bob Honts' and Billy Joe &quot;Red&quot; McCombs' Village at Wolf Creek is 
more like pillage at Wolf Creek. How is destroying a rare fen wetland a good 
thing? How is a homeowners association that will not pay municipal taxes to 
support fire, police, EMTs, hospitals, trash disposal and schools a good thing? 
How is the 450,000 gallons a water a day it will take to flush the toilets at 
the Village a good thing?</p> 
<p>One minute, Honts says that this development will be for the people who 
already ski at Wolf Creek. Then he says that this development is for the 
higher-end skier, the type of people who don't already come here - the type who 
will fly in on their private planes. That he envisions the tri-county area of 
Archuleta, Rio Grande and Mineral counties to be the next Jackson Hole.</p> 
<p>Yes, our property values will increase, but so will our taxes. Crime will 
increase. Our schools will be overcrowded. People who fly in on private planes 
will not shop at our little gift shops or eat in our restaurants. They won't 
have to. The Village will have 12 restaurants and enough retail space for two 
super WalMarts.</p> 
<p>Honts envisions increased income levels and quality of life. What he really 
means is that if your income level isn't high enough you won't be able to 
afford the quality of life here. He's already stated that we are economically 
deprived. Our income levels and housing costs are not on par with the rest of 
Colorado. Good. That's why we live here. We can afford to live here. We don't 
have to deal with traffic and sprawl and we get to enjoy hiking and fishing and 
the beauty that God created.</p> 
<p>Honts said he would use &quot;every local resource we can.&quot; Yet the 
draft EIS from the Forest Service mentions an influx of 1,200 workers. When 
City Market expanded, they brought in crews to do the construction. Honts will 
bring his crews from Texas, pay them Texas wages and expect them to be able to 
afford to live here.</p> 
<p>Honts suggests there will be a &quot;tremendous interchange of money.&quot; 
For whom? Himself, Mr. McCombs, a few privileged realtors? What about our 
teachers? What about our small business owners? What about the regular people 
who live here and struggle to make ends meet?</p> 
<p>&quot;For every negative there are two positives,&quot; Honts said. We 
haven't found one positive yet.</p> 
<p>As a community, we must band together and shoot a whole lot more arrows in 
the butt of this preposterous idea. Honts, we don't want to be Jackson Hole or 
Vail or Aspen. That's why we choose to live here.</p> 
<p>Richard and Leanne Goebel</p> 
<p><b>&nbsp;</b><b>Haunting Honts</b></p> 
<p>Dear Editor:</p> 
<p>After reading comments by Bob Honts of The Village at Wolf Creek 
Development Corporation last week in The SUN, I want to thank him. He makes 
excellent arguments on why not to build this project.</p> 
<p>Honts: &quot;A rising tide will lift all boats.&quot;</p> 
<p>True, a rising tide can lift boats &#138; right out of their docks where 
they were secure. A rising tide can cause erosion of the landscape, just as the 
Village will erode the landscape of the Wolf Creek area. Obviously, Mr. Honts 
has not had much experience with rising tides. Perhaps he should visit Florida 
during the hurricane season.</p> 
<p>Honts: &quot;I think I'm doing you a good thing by bringing Red (McCombs) 
into this area.&quot;</p> 
<p>Does this sound pompous to you? Do we need Red McCombs?</p> 
<p>Honts: &quot;I see Pagosa Springs, South Fork ... the entire tri-county 
area as a Jackson Hole.&quot;</p> 
<p>How many Jackson Holes does the world need? There is only one Pagosa 
Springs, one South Fork. This area is special already. Let's not destroy its 
unique character by trying to imitate other &quot;developments.&quot;</p> 
<p>&quot;Honts &#138; is confident the village would have a positive impact on 
income levels and quality of life in surrounding communities.&quot;</p> 
<p>I see the world differently than Honts. More income does not necessarily 
lead to a higher quality of life. Our mountains, lakes, streams, meadows add 
more quality to our life than more condos will.</p> 
<p>Honts: &quot;The goal is to make the village a year-round attraction, 'the 
premiere mountain-recreation village in the world,' complete with timeshares, 
spa facilities and, eventually, a companion golf village and the possibility 
for a 'university conference center.'&quot;</p> 
<p>To develop in such a beautiful area is counterproductive: You wind up 
destroying what attracted you to the area in the first place. There are 
thousands of resorts with these amenities &#138; do we need more?</p> 
<p>Honts: &#138; stating the aim is &quot;to bring in the type of people who, 
today, don't come to the area ... the higher-end skier who will fly in 
commercially or on their own planes.&quot;</p> 
<p>Really? Does this make sense?</p> 
<p>&quot;&#138;Honts says the village could create 2,000-3,000 jobs during its 
20- to 30-year proposed build-out scenario, as well as &quot;a hundred or more 
joint venture' possibilities.&quot;</p> 
<p>Exactly! Just like a cancer, a noxious weed, or an invasive species. Will 
we let it in, let it &quot;develop&quot; and spread, or will we stop it while 
we still can?</p> 
<p>&quot;Village employees, said Honts, would more than likely reside in 
off-site 'moderate-income housing' and be bused to and from the workplace.&quot;
</p> 
<p>That's right, instead of a well-integrated community like Pagosa Springs is 
now, you will have a stratified, class society and all of its associated 
problems.</p> 
<p>Honts, describing the village as &quot;an opportunity for 'a tremendous 
interchange of money that isn't coming here today.'&quot;</p> 
<p>Ahh &#138;there's the rub &#138; money! Obviously Honts and McCombs are 
only interested in money. Such &quot;interchange&quot; of money would certainly 
degrade the quality of life we have today in this area.</p>

<p><b>&nbsp;</b><b>A tough sell</b></p> 
<p>Dear Editor:</p> 
<p>Many years ago I attended a sales training seminar sponsored by one of our 
country's largest corporations in which the facilitator stressed the point that 
if you can create enough anxiety in a person's mind you can sell him/her almost 
anything.</p> 
<p>Could it be that Jim Sawicki attended a similar seminar? Whether or not, he 
certainly applied this strategy in his letter to this column two weeks ago.</p> 
<p>We have seen this strategy used very effectively by Republicans time and 
again during the last two decades. Do you remember that while the president's 
father campaigned for a kinder, gentler America his promoters pounded away on 
the Willy Horton theme and making the world liberal profane, as though a 
liberal administration would empty the prisons making it unsafe to be anywhere 
outside your won house?</p> 
<p>After 9/11 they beautifully created the atmosphere of insecurity, 
reinforcing it with a macho pseudo-patriotism which called for us to fly the 
flag on the pickup and wear a flag lapel pin or be declared un-American, a sort 
of return to the Goldwater era slogan of &quot;America: love it (our way) or 
leave it.&quot;</p> 
<p>And now there's the Department of Homeland Security which routinely bounces 
us up and down with announcements of red, yellow and orange levels of 
insecurity, information which would be more aptly provided only to those in 
charge of maintaining &quot;security.&quot; And all the while the implied 
emphasis is that only a conservative Republican administration is able or 
willing to keep us safe in these insecure times.</p> 
<p>Mr. Sawicki suggests that only a leadership possessing the proper amount of 
testosterone can preserve America, and insinuates that Democrats don't have it 
or, at best, need to get more of it. But does Mr. Sawicki understand 
testosterone? Besides being the builder of the physical he-man attributes it is 
the fuel of male dominance and aggression, shaping attitudes of superiority 
that weaken bonds of love and attachment. Domestic violence, as well as other 
violent crimes, most often occurs where a male demonstrates a high blood level 
of testosterone, and a woman is most dangerous during the part of her cycle 
when her estrogen levels fall and testosterone effects appear. Truly, this is 
not the stuff to make a kinder, gentler America or to shape America's attitudes 
toward the rest of humanity.</p> 
<p>Having been taught that strategy long ago and now reading Mr. Sawicki's 
letter, I believe it is more important than ever to carefully examine what the 
salesman is trying to sell rather than to buy it on brand name alone or 
appearance.</p>

<p><b>&nbsp;</b><b>End of an era</b></p> 
<p>Dear Editor:</p> 
<p>Maybe five years is not an era, but it is long enough to get in comfortable 
habits. An example is searching the paper every week for &quot;Cruising with 
Cruse.&quot; Last week I did this for the last time - with regret.</p> 
<p>We readers have been treated to insights about Pagosa Country and 
self-deprecating accounts of exploits and adventures. We have learned about 
presidents, history, and various tidbits probably off the Internet. It has been 
light reading. Some of it has shed light.</p> 
<p>Anyway, I am sure this is one of many letters thanking the paper for 
running the Cruse column. Maybe it's time for another book. How about 
&quot;Five Years in The Sun&quot;?</p>

<p><b>&nbsp;</b><b>'Big Box' vision</b></p> 
<p>Dear Editor:</p> 
<p>The decision to allow a 'big box' into Pagosa Springs deserves careful 
consideration before expiration of the current moratorium. Choosing prudently 
will insure the decision reflects what is best for the future of our town.</p> 
<p>Surely, there exists analysis of a big box's impact on towns similar in 
size to Pagosa Springs. Determining if those findings match our vision of 
Pagosa's future is vital to avoid making a decision we later regret.</p> 
<p>If we need to wait until the town's vision is more clearly defined, so be 
it. Let us not be rushed into a decision whose ramifications we don't yet fully 
understand.</p> 
<p>It would be a pity to unintentionally lose the charm and many of the small 
businesses that attract us to this special place.</p>

<p><b>&nbsp;</b><b>'V.P. Gone'</b></p> 
<p>Dear Editor:</p> 
<p>During the vice presidential debate, Mr. Cheney challenged Senator Edward's 
attendance record, noting that a North Carolina newspaper called him, 
&quot;Senator Gone.&quot;</p> 
<p>To prove his point, he said that as President of the Senate, he is on 
Capitol Hill nearly every Tuesday while Congress is in session. Well, if that 
is true, he must be spending a lot of time just wandering around the Capitol. 
Records show that Mr. Cheney only presided over the Senate twice in four years.
</p> 
<p>Senator Edwards actually presided over the Senate three times during the 
same period, one more than the V.P. Then, Mr. Cheney said that he hadn't met 
Senator Edwards until the day of the debate. It turns out that there is 
indisputable evidence that the Vice President has met the Senator at least 
twice, first at the Senator's swearing in and later at a prayer breakfast where 
the two were photographed chatting.</p> 
<p>If Mr. Cheney will lie about such an insignificant issue where he can be so 
easily proven wrong, what will he do when he is shielded from exposure?</p> 
<p>Further, what does his record on the Hill say about his own engagement with 
Congress? Perhaps, we should call him &quot;V.P. Gone!&quot;</p> 
<p>John W. Porco</p> 
<p><b>&nbsp;</b><b>Detestable acts</b></p> 
<p>Dear Editor:</p> 
<p>This letter is addressed to all Kerry Democrats:</p> 
<p>Ask any recent volunteer to the armed forces who they are voting for and 
the answer will be President Bush.</p> 
<p>George W. Bush has proven he has what it takes to lead our country through 
these dark days, because he puts his trust in Jesus Christ.</p> 
<p>John Kerry, on the other hand, will never earn the respect of our troops 
because of his Vietnam record and his lack of commitment to our soldiers in 
Iraq.</p> 
<p>Kerry has stated that he will lift the bans on the hideous practices of 
partial birth abortion and embryonic stem cell research. Partial birth abortion 
is the gruesome procedure of partially delivering the baby, then killing the 
child and taking its organs for medical purposes. If the child were fully 
delivered from the birth canal, this would amount to murder under the law.</p> 
<p>What is the difference between partially delivering the child or fully 
delivering it?</p> 
<p>Embryonic stem cell research takes cells from children who are conceived in 
laboratory conditions, known as embryo farms. This procedure, of course, ends 
the life of the child. There are hundreds of thousands of these embryos that 
were brought to life during the Clinton years and are now frozen, waiting to be 
adopted.</p> 
<p>When implanted in a mom's womb, these little people can grow to be normal 
human beings, and several happy children are alive today who were conceived 
this way because someone cared about adopting a frozen embryo.</p> 
<p>President Bush supports adult stem cell research, which shows to be much 
more effective that the embryo kind, and no one has to die to obtain adult stem 
cells.</p> 
<p>I really don't know how a person could knowingly choose to vote for a 
political candidate who promotes so many detestable acts in his platform, but 
if all the Kerry-Edwards supporters were brought together and laid end to end 
around the equator of the earth, the rest of us would be much better off.</p> 
<p>Choose Jesus Christ. Choose life.</p> 
<p>James W. Sanders</p> 
<p><b>&nbsp;</b><b>Already a threat</b></p> 
<p>Dear Editor:</p> 
<p>We are Pagosa &quot;part-timers&quot; who own a home in Alpha and will move 
to Pagosa permanently next year. We suspect that we are not dissimilar from 
many &quot;newcomers&quot; to Pagosa &#138; relatively affluent and 
appreciative of a new quality of life for urban dwellers searching for respite 
from the rat race.</p> 
<p>Therefore, by nature, we oppose development that would radically alter the 
character this place. But, we are also accustomed to the retail conveniences of 
the urban setting. The town and region is growing as more folks like us arrive 
and we applaud the efforts that are now underway, particularly in reference to 
the &quot;big box&quot; issue, to manage this growth.</p> 
<p>It is curious to us that the reports in The SUN have contained little 
direct comment from the business community in Pagosa. Government can only do so 
much to control growth. Market forces, largely influenced by the response of 
the private sector, are at least as important. What is the strategy of local 
businesses to retain and increase their share of the local market?</p> 
<p>The &quot;big boxes&quot; in Durango, and even Farmington, are already a 
threat to local business, as is the Internet. Local merchants need to formulate 
a strategy to meet this competition now, not just simply oppose it coming to 
their doorstep in a last ditch effort to survive.</p> 
<p>Last summer we needed to purchase a couple of large ticket items. We 
checked out products at local stores. In both cases, the items were not in 
stock or brands we wanted not carried. We were told they could be ordered, but 
it would take at least two weeks. Our projects could not wait, so we drove to 
Durango and purchased the items at a store, in stock, from a wide selection for 
about 20 percent less than we would have paid locally.</p> 
<p>Of course, while we were there we purchased a number of other smaller items 
that we would normally buy in Pagosa, despite higher prices.</p> 
<p>Pagosa merchants need a &quot;Don't Drive to Durango&quot; campaign backed 
up by a solid service and pricing strategy. For example, they could custom buy 
over the Internet and get fast delivery as a customer service or, let us buy 
direct from them (with a built in service fee) from their own Web site 
addresses plastered all over town. We place value on buying local to support 
our community. We also value service, selection, price and convenience. Give us 
all this and we will pay a reasonable premium to buy in Pagosa.</p> 
<p>Our time, fuel and frustration are worth a lot of dollars that can be 
captured by the local economy. Local merchants can prevent Pagosa's growing, 
affluent &quot;ex-urban&quot; market from spending a day a month in Durango 
buying saws and skis and stocking up on sand paper and socks. Start doing it 
now and none of us will want a &quot;big-box.&quot; And guess what &#138; 
&quot;big-boxes&quot; won't want us either!</p> 
<p>Bryan and Mary Sickbert</p> 
<p><b>&nbsp;</b><b>Pay to write</b></p>

paying for the space that they take up in The SUN?</p> 
<p>Claudia Smith</p> 
<p><b>&nbsp;</b><b>Radicalization</b></p> 
<p>Dear Editor:</p> 
<p>In a less guarded moment President Bush conceded that you can never totally 
eliminate terrorism and Senator Kerry added that likewise prostitution and 
alcoholism can never be wiped out, but that all can be reduced to a nuisance 
rather then drive our daily lives.</p> 
<p>Sept. 11 was a horrendous shock, but that is now more then three years ago, 
and in that period no other attack occurred, homeland security gives much 
better warning and protection, and in perspective 50 times more persons were 
horribly killed in traffic accidents than died on 9/11.</p> 
<p>Unfortunately security outside of the U.S. in particular Muslim countries 
has decreased as a result of increased radicalization of the younger 
generation. This presents a problem not only for us, but just as much for the 
majority of the local clerics who want just as much peace for their people as 
does our clergy.</p> 
<p>This may open up an opportunity for discussion and possibly measures to 
reduce further radicalization, and less conflict, but it will take a different 
less confrontational approach than thus far.</p>

<p><b>Lunar eclipse event set for Oct. 27 </b></p> 
<p><b>By Jim Super</b></p> 
<p><b>Special to The PREVIEW</b></p> 
<p>The last of the spectacular celestial events for 2004 will occur Wednesday, 
Oct. 27, with the total lunar eclipse.</p> 
<p>This will be a breathtaking show if the weather cooperates and clear skies 
are in our good fortune. The total eclipse is not only a visually stunning 
display of the cosmos but an opportunity for education of the young and old 
alike. For one to appreciate what is being visualized is to truly understand 
what is occurring during this event.</p> 
<p>An eclipse of the moon only occurs during a full moon, and only when it 
passes through some portion of the earth's shadow.</p> 
<p>The shadow is comprised of two cone shaped parts, one cradled inside the 
other. The outer shadow is known as the penumbra. This is the region where 
earth blocks some (but not the entirety ) of the sun's rays. The umbral, or 
inner shadow, is the region where earth blocks all of the sun's rays from 
reflecting off the moon.</p> 
<p>The total eclipse begins with the penumbral phase, which is followed by a 
partial eclipse, then the full eclipse. The eclipse in its continuum will end 
with a partial followed by a penumbral eclipse. From start to finish, the 
eclipse will last approximately three hours and 40 minutes. This time does not 
include the penumbral phase, which is difficult to detect with an untrained eye 
and devoid of interest to most outside of the scientific community.</p> 
<p>Totality is when the moon is in full eclipse. It is estimated that the moon 
in totality will last 81 minutes during this eclipse. This is also the most 
beautiful stage for anyone who has witnessed its splendor. The moon in full 
eclipse creates its own color palette.</p> 
<p>During total eclipses, one can expect to see colors ranging from red to 
yellow, bright orange to gray. A gray or dark brown moon is indicative of 
recent volcanic activity with airborne dust or ash in the atmosphere. In 
actuality, no two eclipses are alike, and all are a marvel to witness.</p> 
<p>We can only imagine what our ancestors' thoughts were as they perceived 
this phenomenon. Lunar eclipses have been recorded in ancient history along 
with involved myths and legends to explain this lunar phenomenon. Different 
cultures at different times perceived this as a spiritual venue. Some 
ceremonies were performed to scare dragons from swallowing the moon or to ward 
off evil omens.</p> 
<p>People without scientific knowledge created stories and legends as their 
way of explaining lunar eclipses. Some of these stories continue today. One 
such legend holds that there are more births during a lunar eclipse. With no 
scientific fact to collaborate, this finding remains an urban legend.</p> 
<p>If we are lucky enough to have clear visibility during the eclipse, we are 
in for one of the universe's great shows. The total eclipse is visible to the 
naked eye; however, a good pair of binoculars will enhance your viewing 
experience. Various groups routinely form in celebration of lunar eclipses with 
festivities to celebrate one of the best shows in celesta.</p> 
<p>Pagosa is fortunate enough to be involved in one of the celebratory as well 
as educational venues.</p> 
<p>Chimney Rock Interpretive Association has invited all to a fall fund-raiser 
to view the lunar eclipse.</p> 
<p>Ron Sutcliffe, archeo-astronomer, will be the guest speaker for the night. 
Ron has been conducting research at Chimney Rock for the last two years and is 
an expert on the Northern Lunar Standstill and its relationship to the Chimney 
Rock spires. This gives the public an opportunity to learn more about lunar 
eclipse, the night sky and other related phenomenon.</p> 
<p>The fund-raising event will take place in a private residence in Pagosa. 
The program begins at 7 p.m. with the full eclipse at 9. The tickets are $30 
per person, with coffee and specialty desserts included with the price of 
admission.</p> 
<p>Reservations for this event are required and space is limited. All proceeds 
will be used to support Chimney Rock Interpretive Association, a nonprofit 
organization working in partnership with the U.S. Forest Service, San Juan 
National Forest.</p> 
<p>For further information, and to make reservations, contact Lindsay Morgan, 
program manager 264-2287 (daytime) 731-1280 (evenings). Please make all checks 
payable to Chimney Rock Interpretive Association.</p> 
<p>This is an excellent opportunity for everyone to learn and enjoy the 
wonders of our universe.</p>

gritty, country-blues-inspired songs at this week's Whistle Pig House Concert,

called Alaska home for the past 30-some years. He's worked the canneries and 
fishing boats, hunted on the Arctic tundra and lived among the many diverse 
cultures that coexist on the &quot;Last Frontier.&quot;</p> 
<p>His songs spring from those experiences, sometimes like joyful cries, 
sometimes like aching wails. Folk legend Townes Van Zandt called Buddy &quot;a 
player and a poet.&quot; EFolkMusic.com reviewer Bob Barlow, writing about 
Buddy's third album, wrote: &quot;Blinding Flash of Light&quot; is a CD poised 
so evenly on the knife-edge between hope and despair that it takes several 
listens just to determine where Buddy Tabor stands on the big questions he has 
chosen to tackle. Fortunately, it's worth every spin. Gifted with a gritty, 
honest voice and a solid grasp of country blues guitar, the Alaska-based Tabor 
plies his talents to weigh in on topics ranging from love ... to the 
exploitation of child labor ... to the nuclear annihilation of our planet ...

<p><b>Halloween party plans moving ahead </b></p> 
<p><b>By Pauline Benetti</b></p> 
<p><b>Special to The PREVIEW</b></p> 
<p>Plans for the first community center Halloween party are moving right along.
</p> 
<p>With the help of decorations borrowed from the Catholic church, community 
center staff and volunteers will transform the multipurpose room into a 
phantasmagoria of Halloween imagery to be enjoyed by all, 5-7 p.m. Oct. 29.</p> 
<p>As of Friday we had the Shady Pines 4-H club doing a bean bag toss, PLPOA 
and Heather Hunt of School within a School both doing fishing booths of 
different kinds, the Lutheran School doing a putt putt golf game, NORA doing a 
shark toss and BootJack Ranch sponsoring an inflatable house. And for the young 
ones who like to hear scary stories, Friends of the Library will be reading 
them.</p> 
<p>Those are just the games; then to frighten any loose wits about you, the 
Teen Center will host a haunted house and Sherry Smith will conduct a graveyard 
tour and the Senior Center will preside over a Mystery Box that invites you to 
put your hand inside.</p> 
<p>Anyone who wants to look ghastly can receive a face painting by the Arts 
Council or get a temporary tattoo that glows in the dark from Rotary members.
</p> 
<p>Food, you ask? The Kiwanis Club will have hot dogs and punch, SWAP is doing 
an apple bobbing event and Bonnie Nyre from Slices of Nature will bring her hot 
caramel cider and pumpkin flavored coffee. The community center will sponsor a 
Cupcake Walk. Those of you who loves to bake, we need donations of cupcakes for 
this event. We also invite other interesting ideas.</p> 
<p>The community center will sponsor a costume contest with categories as 
follows - Most Original, Most Gruesome and Most Elaborate. Start now thinking 
about how you can win a very nice prize.</p> 
<p>We are still looking for other organizations, businesses (thank you Schmidt 
Chiropractic for the monetary donation) and individuals to join with us in 
sponsoring a game or food booth or some type of appropriate activity.</p> 
<p>Here's a chance for the young and the young at heart to dress up and have 
fun. Call Mercy or Pauline at 264-5232 to take part in this fun event.</p>

<p><b>Father-daughter Purity Ball set by pregnancy center </b></p> 
<p>The Pregnancy Support Center will host a father-daughter Purity Ball 6-9 
p.m. Oct. 30 in the Pagosa Lakes Clubhouse.</p> 
<p>Purpose of the ball is for fathers to pledge commitments to protect their 
daughters while daughters pledge commitments to purity.</p> 
<p>This is a very special time between daughters and daddies.</p> 
<p>The active presence of a father in the life of his daughter is important 
for her future. Author Evelyn Bassoff, Ph.D., makes this statement in her book, 
&quot;Cherishing Our Daughters: How Parents Can Raise Girls to Become Strong 
and Loving Women.&quot;</p> 
<p>&quot;If our daughters are to flower,&quot; she says, &quot;they need 
optimal growing conditions. Almost always this means being lovingly cared for 
by mother and father. It is from her mother that a girl learns to be a woman; 
it is from her father that she learns what to expect from men in the way of 
love and respect.&quot;</p> 
<p>Dads, this is a special event for both you and your daughter. Be her hero 
as she enjoys the princess treatment. Since we want daughters to feel like 
princesses, we are asking for both dads and daughters to dress up, and 
&quot;Sunday dress&quot; is just fine.</p> 
<p>The ball is for single girls at least 11 years old or older, and feel free 
to bring all of your daughters. The center is encouraging &quot;surrogate 
dads&quot; to bring a special young lady to this event who may not have a 
father in her life.</p> 
<p>The cost is a recommended $25 per couple. If the cost is too much, come and 
enjoy the evening anyway. Music will be provided by KPCL's own Ole Blomberg and 
the center will provide desserts.</p> 
<p>RSVP by calling the center at 264-5963 or e-mail response to 
pregcntr@pagosa.net.</p>

<p>This month's meeting in the Unitarian Universalist Fellowship Hall will be 
7:30 p.m. Monday, Oct. 25, instead of the previous 7 p.m. Tuesday meeting time.
</p> 
<p>The film to be screened and discussed will be the first of Krzysztof 
Kieslowski's Polish-French trilogy &quot;Three Colors: Blue, White, and 
Red&quot; (English title).</p> 
<p>&quot;Blue,&quot; starring Juliette Binoche, is a penetrating, hypnotic 
meditation on liberty and loss, and the rehabilitation of a human spirit after 
a painful tragedy.</p> 
<p>A woman loses her family in a car crash. Following a period of emotional 
paralysis, she telephones an old friend who has always been in love with her, 
and tells him his chance has come at last. The denouement of this cold,

<p>This movie is subtitled and rated &quot;R.&quot; A suggested $3 donation 
will benefit The Friends of the Library.</p> 
<p>The UU Fellowship Hall is Unit 15, Greenbriar Plaza, which is located on

<p><b>Woman's Civic Club keeps bazaar alive </b></p> 
<p><b>By Kate Terry </b></p> 
<p><b>SUN Columnist</b></p> 
<p>The annual Holiday Bazaar, sponsored by the Woman's Civic Club of Pagosa 
Springs, is just two weeks off - Saturday, Nov. 6 - and will be held at the 
community center.</p> 
<p>For many years, the Woman's (and please notice the singular spelling of 
woman) Civic Club of Pagosa Springs has sponsored the Bazaar. The purpose has 
always been to raise money for the local library. Along the way, the place has 
changed and so has the time and date, but the past two years the Holiday Bazaar 
has been the first Saturday in November at the Pagosa Springs Community Center.
</p> 
<p>This year the Bazaar will open at 9 a.m. and close at 4 p.m. The drawing 
for the raffle will be at 4 p.m. and one doesn't have to be present to win.</p> 
<p>Raffle tickets are $1 each and 6 for $5 and can be purchased at Sisson 
Library or from Civic Club members or at the Bazaar itself. Lenore Bright and 
others always have a station at the bake sale table. And also, there by the 
table, the items to be raffled will be on display.</p> 
<p>The raffle is a good deal - 20 items or more. As in year's past, there will 
be a $50 money basket, a $50 money wreath and one of Margaret Wilson's 
handknitted stoles. And every year there is one big item. This year it's a 
good-looking quilt made and donated by the members of the Pagosa Piecemakers 
quilt club.</p> 
<p>Civic Club members man the kitchen offering chili, beans, hot dogs, etc. 
One can follow the eating pattern of starting in the kitchen and ending at the 
bake sale table.</p> 
<p>A little history: the Woman's Civic Club of Pagosa Springs was started in 
1910 to take over the actual operation of the Pagosa Springs Library with a 
collection of 202 books. It was housed in the basement of the Methodist Church. 
Today its objective is to continue to support the public library and give 
assistance to other civic projects when possible.</p>

<p>&quot;All depends,&quot; the native drawled. &quot;Do you mean by them that

<p><b>Luncheon salutes efforts of Diplomats </b></p> 
<p><b>By Doug Trowbridge</b></p> 
<p><b>SUN Columnist</b></p> 
<p>Those amazing ladies you see on the Preview cover this week are two of an 
extraordinary corps of folks affectionately referred to as Chamber Diplomats.
</p> 
<p>What is especially notable about Joan Cortright and Barbara Palmer is that 
they have been coming to work at the Chamber for over 20 years.</p> 
<p>Yep, these two have been a part of us for all those years and continue to 
come back every spring to put in more hours serving every Chamber member and 
business in this community.</p> 
<p>There are several Diplomats who have served faithfully for a number of 
years, but Joan and Barbara are the unequivocal Queens of Longevity, and we 
want to acknowledge their significant contribution to this Chamber and to 
Pagosa Springs.</p> 
<p>They have not only served, but have done so with amazing good nature, 
cheerfulness and professionalism and take this opportunity to salute them and 
thank them for their great gift to this Chamber.</p> 
<p>Here at the Chamber, we are about the business of celebrating all those 
special people in addition to Barbara and Joan who keep us afloat - our beloved 
Chamber Diplomats. This group of remarkable volunteers hosts our Visitor Center 
seven days a week during the summer months and on the weekends during the 
winter with absolutely no thought of anything in return. Mind you, they have 
been doing this for many, many years and are simply the heart and soul of our 
Visitor Center and could never, never be repaid for all they do. We will host a 
luncheon in their honor this week, and many grateful businesses have sent over 
tokens of their appreciation to put in their &quot;goody bags&quot; presented 
the day of the luncheon.</p> 
<p>Thank you, thank you, thank you Diplomats for all you do for us. Know that 
we love and appreciate you more than we could every tell you.</p> 
<p><b>Witches and goblins</b> </p> 
<p>We certainly hope you all plan to join the big Halloween party at the 
community center 5-7 p.m. Friday, Oct. 29.</p> 
<p>There will be many festivities for all the little spooks and goblins 
including a costume contest as well as the food, games and activities with 
prizes galore.</p> 
<p>As has been pointed out in the past, the safe, warm, dry environment of the 
community center is a vast improvement over the potential rain, cold and 
darkness involved in trooping the little ones around the neighborhood.</p> 
<p>The kids will love it, and you can feel sure that parents will be equally 
as pleased to hang out and watch all the fun.</p>

sponsors for the party. Please give them a call at 264-5232 if you would like 
to offer a hand that night.</p>

provided by John Graves with dancing honors performed by local ballerinas.</p>

<p><b>Volunteers needed</b> </p> 
<p>Looking for a rewarding way to spend a few free hours? The Archuleta County 
Education Center is seeking volunteer tutors for their General Education 
Development (GED) classes.</p> 
<p>In order to obtain a GED, students must pass tests in five areas of 
education: language arts reading, writing, social studies, science and 
mathematics. Tutors in each of these areas are needed to work one-on-one with 
students preparing to take their GED test.</p> 
<p>Volunteers do not need to be teachers, just have a good general knowledge 
in their chosen subject area and two to three hours per week to volunteer.</p> 
<p>The GED tutoring program operates Monday through Thursday from 1:30 to 3:30 
p.m., and Monday and Wednesday from 5 to 8 p.m. If you are interested in 
helping out, call the Education Center at 264-2835 or drop by the Center at 4th 
and Lewis streets.</p>

<p></p> <b>Veteran's Corner</b> 
<p></p> 
<p><b>Veterans served - and not just during war time </b></p> 
<p><b>By Andy Fautheree</b></p> 
<p><b>SUN Columnist</b></p> 
<p>My semiannual subject this week is, who is a veteran?</p> 
<p>I often repeat this information in this column because time and time again 
I visit with former members of the U.S. military who think they are not 
veterans because they didn't go off to war in some far corner of the world.</p> 
<p><b>Wartime not necessary</b></p> 
<p>Nothing could be further from the truth. In fact, very few VA benefits are 
limited to veterans who served during war time.</p> 
<p>Many VA benefits, including the popular VA Health Care program, are 
available to veterans who have been discharged for or released from active 
military service under other than dishonorable conditions. In some cases, for 
as little as one day of active duty service, if the veteran served before 
September 7, 1980. And, that one-day active duty service may have nothing to do 
with wartime service.</p> 
<p><b>Active service</b></p> 
<p>Most VA benefits do relate to active duty service. For instance, six months 
of military service for military reserve training purposes does not count 
toward active duty service in most cases. However, a veteran may qualify for 
benefits while in the military reserves if they were called up to active duty 
and completed the term for which they were called, and who were granted an 
other than dishonorable discharge. Veterans discharged early for a 
service-connected disability would also be exempt from active duty eligibility.
</p> 
<p>After Sept. 7, 1980, a veteran must have served for 24 continuous months of 
active military service, or have been released under special circumstances 
(under special VA or military policies and regulations).</p> 
<p><b>Eligibilities differ</b> </p> 
<p>An exception to the wartime military service requirement would be for a 
veteran's pension claim based on limited income. VA pensions are granted only 
to those veterans who served during wartime. However, the veteran did not have 
to actually be in combat, only have served during a period of wartime. For 
instance, many veterans served in Europe or here in the United States during a 
wartime period. They would still be eligible for most wartime VA benefits.</p> 
<p><b>Wartime periods</b></p> 
<p>For these purposes, wartime periods are the following:</p> 
<p>- Persian Gulf War - The period Aug. 2, 1990 through a date to be set by 
law or Presidential Proclamation. </p> 
<p>- Vietnam Era - The period Aug. 5, 1964 (Feb. 28, 1961 for veterans who 
served &quot;in country&quot; before Aug. 5, 1964) and ending May 7, 1975.</p> 
<p>- Korean Conflict - The period June 27, 1950 through Jan. 31, 1955.</p> 
<p>- World War II - The period Dec. 7, 1941 through December 31, 1946. If the 
veteran was in service on Dec. 31, 1946, continuous service before July 26, 
1947, is considered World War II service.</p> 
<p>Earlier periods are also considered wartime such as World War I, Mexican 
Border War, Spanish-American War and Indian Wars, but have very limited 
application to veterans or survivors living today.</p> 
<p><b>Reliable information</b> </p> 
<p>Certainly VA benefits for any veteran may be based on individual 
circumstances of military service, or the specific rules for the VA benefit, 
which vary from benefit to benefit. Often well-meaning fellow veterans, friends 
and family members offer advice on VA benefits for which they may not be fully 
informed. I would urge all veterans to check with this office for the latest 
and correct information.</p> 
<p><b>Durango VA Clinic</b> </p> 
<p>The Durango VA Outpatient Clinic is at 400 S. Camino Del Rio, Suite G, 
Durango, CO 81301. Phone number is 247-2214.</p> 
<p><b>Further information</b> </p> 
<p>For information on these and other veterans benefits please call or stop by

<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p> <b>Library News</b> 
<p></p> 
<p><b>We can't build until spring </b></p> 
<p><b>By Lenore Bright</b></p> 
<p><b>SUN Columnist</b></p> 
<p>Time has run out on our plan to start on the new library addition this fall.
</p> 
<p>The architect and Colorado Jaynes are in agreement that we should not rush 
the project. A series of unexpected roadblocks played havoc with our time line 
and cost estimates.</p> 
<p>The major block was the rise in building prices in the last few months. 
These costs were &quot;budget breakers,&quot; and we could not afford the 
severe hike in prices.</p> 
<p>We've gone back to the drawing board and have arrived at a design that will 
stay within our budget and provide all of the options we wanted in the original 
plan. We will start construction as soon as weather permits.</p> 
<p>While we are disappointed that the project is not under way, it has been a 
learning experience for all concerned. I am very proud of the board of 
trustees, the building committee, the architect and representatives of Colorado 
Jaynes who have all worked hard to overcome the many unexpected circumstances 
that have cropped up along the way. (The latest being a sudden lake in the 
crawl space due to the high level of ground water this year.)</p> 
<p>I especially want to thank Don Heitkamp who also volunteers his time to 
oversee the project.</p> 
<p>Because of the higher building costs, we have enough to build the structure 
but will still need to raise more money for added bookshelves, computers, 
furniture and accessories.</p> 
<p>The final push will be to raise another $50,000 for these items. We invite 
everyone with a stake in the project to help us reach this final goal.</p>

<p><b>Meatballs versus meatballs: an autumn ritual</b></p> 
<p><b>By Karl Isberg</b></p> 
<p><b>SUN Columnist</b></p> 
<p>We are well into autumn.</p> 
<p>For some, autumn is a colorful season, time for motor trips to view the 
leaves and their brilliant hues.</p> 
<p>For others, fall is a festive season. They celebrate Oktoberfest and 
Halloween. They bob for apples and gobble bratwurst.</p> 
<p>Yet others recognize it as football season. They trek happily to the local 
stadium, they tune their televisions and radios to games on the weekends.</p> 
<p>For me, it is meatball season.</p> 
<p>It is a profoundly gloomy time.</p> 
<p>Come fall, there are meatballs everywhere. Working at a newspaper gives me 
a unique perspective on the meatball phenomenon and it affects me adversely.</p>
<p>I'm not referring to the meatballs you cook and eat. I'm using the word to 
label the goofballs who turn out in greater numbers in the fall than at any 
other time of the year: pinheads, yahoos, nincompoops, featherbrains, 
mooncalves, loud simpletons of all sorts. In general, they are those fellow 
citizens whose behavior and ideas make you question the value of the human 
species.</p> 
<p>And whether you wish to remain part of it.</p> 
<p>Autumn is the meatballs' favorite time of year. They emerge from the gray 
background in overwhelming numbers and proceed to do their distressing work.</p>
<p>For the most part, that work consists of spraying a thick film of venom and 
nonsense on everything and everyone in range.</p> 
<p>Why is it, I wonder as I cradle my head in my hands, that more nonsense is 
dispensed in the fall?</p> 
<p>Two reasons jump out: Fall is the traditional political season, and fall is 
when children are sent back to school.</p> 
<p>There are no larger or more obnoxious groups of meatballs than the 
political crowd and a certain type of parent.</p> 
<p>This year is a presidential election year and, as such, it is a prime 
breeding ground for the political meatballs. We can't get away from them.</p> 
<p>If you haven't been inundated by a flood of meatball political advertising, 
you either live in a plywood shack miles from civilization or you are one of 
those effete bozos who gloats about a television-free life. The advertising 
creeps across the floor of consciousness like the backwash from a clogged sewer 
line. Given the utter lack of civility and concern for the truth exhibited in 
nearly all that advertising, affiliations aside, a plywood shack looks mighty 
appealing.</p> 
<p>Meatballs obviously run most of the ad agencies in America. They are in 
charge of most campaign organizations; they write the speeches, manipulate the 
sound bites, spin the news. They will stoop to any level to get their way, 
concoct any story that serves their purposes, distort any information as it 
suits them. They inhabit every nook and cranny of the political flophouse. It 
goes without saying most political candidates are meatballs, so the situation 
is unbearable.</p> 
<p>Read the razor-sharp political commentary in most letters columns in 
newspapers; listen to the average radio talk show. It's depressing. It's the 
Meatball Nation, alive with clich&eacute;, plagued by one-dimensional 
sloganeering, rife with a hostility antithetic to a necessary solidarity as a 
people, accompanied by the sound of people's hands patting their own backs.</p> 
<p>Listen to the promises made by candidates, at all levels. It's sad to think 
people believe them.</p> 
<p>You want a Meatball extravaganza? Take a gander at a lot of what passes for 
parenting in many families. We are experiencing an epidemic of meatballs 
raising meatballs-to-be.</p> 
<p>With the start of a new school season, the wreckage of the child-dominated 
family washes up on our cultural shore, debris produced by a terrible disaster. 
This is evidenced not only by legions of adolescent dimwits walking around with 
cell phones glued to their ears, clad in baggy pants and so empty headed they 
have no idea how to wear their hats, but by parents whose behaviors mirror an 
inability to accept their responsibilities, to admit the limitations of their 
children, to endure any criticism that strips them of the chance to live out 
their illusions through their offspring.</p> 
<p>The start of the new school year is meatball season - as a growing number 
of parents assail school teachers and administrators whenever an assessment of 
the wee one does not harmonize with their own skewed visions. It is the 
beginning of the school sports season, during which the most rabid and demented 
meatballs roll forth, spewing their warped criticism and bile, demeaning the 
efforts of coaches and of players clearly more skilled than their child.</p> 
<p>This type of parent demands a dilution of standards in the classroom, 
refusing to accept any but the highest rewards for their child's half-hearted 
efforts while, at the same time, allowing the child to indulge the garbage of 
contemporary entertainment at will. These meatballs roll on, seeking someone to 
blame, finding fault everywhere but close to home, anywhere but between their 
own ears. Autumn finds them most active, their paranoic eyes darting back and 
forth, their fevered brows knit, their fangs bared.</p> 
<p>There are meatballs everywhere you look.</p> 
<p>Fortunately, most are practically benign.</p> 
<p>A few, unfortunately, are evil - those who persistently seek to harm 
others, whose malevolence is fired by a psychotic inability to reckon with 
their own failures and limitations, who cannot scan the arid desert of their 
own lives with a clear and honest eye. These meatballs are no strangers to 
shame, but remain oblivious to its stain.</p> 
<p>I'm thinking all this as I sit in my living room on a rainy day, waiting 
for the skylight to leak.</p> 
<p>I realize I'm cruising for emotional trouble. My fixation on the meatball 
phenomenon is leading me to a dark, dark place.</p> 
<p>I take evasive action.</p> 
<p>First, some cleansing breaths (I've been watching &quot;Judy's Yoga 
Hour&quot; every morning on satellite TV). I remind myself that one's 
disappointments are not the result of what others do, but of unfair 
expectations that can't be met. I feel almost Buddhist.</p> 
<p>Next, I remember that the meatballs' nastiness, their shallow shadow play, 
is futile, of no value when compared to that which endures, to that which is 
absolutely important. Meatballs die. Better things endure. I feel like I'm 
firing right out of the Tanakh.</p> 
<p>I tell myself I should not be bothered by those who mind other peoples' 
business. I should not be disturbed by mean-spirited and aggressive behavior. I 
should care about greater things, about greater ideas and souls.</p> 
<p>After I take those breaths and distance myself from the icky mass of 
meatball humanity, I turn to self-analysis. Tend your own garden, you know? I 
realize I'm kind of a meatball myself. Not one of the malicious ones, but meaty 
at times, nonetheless. Maybe we all are.</p> 
<p>Then I remind myself most meatballs are amusing. Humor is palliative.</p> 
<p>How can meatballs not be amusing, with their transparent motives and their 
high-decibel noise? How can it not be amusing to watch the Meatball Circus of 
meatball endeavor, set off as it is against the backdrop of transience? What is 
not to enjoy about the goings on in the ego snakepit, the arena of the 
meatball's barely masked self-serving thrashing?</p> 
<p>My chain of associations takes me to bedrock.</p> 
<p>Ecce homo. I am secure again.</p> 
<p>I need food.</p> 
<p>I take my clue from Hermes Trismegistus: As above, so below.</p> 
<p>It'll be meatballs. A fine autumn dish.</p> 
<p>I stumble to the kitchen and whip a basic ball, one that can be cloaked in 
a variety of ways.</p> 
<p>I mix equal parts of finely ground beef, veal and pork. If the meat is not 
ground fine enough at the market, I run it through the teensy disk on my 
Porkert Fleischacker 10.</p> 
<p>To the meat I add half a white onion finely minced and one or two cloves of 
garlic, finely minced, then mashed. If I was in a truly &quot;fine&quot; mood 
I'd demolish the onion and garlic in the food processor, reducing the 
vegetables to a nearly liquid and highly flavorful state.</p> 
<p>Then, I add a beaten egg, a mess of breadcrumbs to bind the mix, salt and 
freshly ground black pepper, some chopped parsley, a pinch of ground nutmeg and 
a tablespoon or so of either water or milk. The ingredients get mixed by hand 
until a whisper this side of emulsified.</p> 
<p>The balls are formed. In this case, since I wish to forestall the return of 
my sour mood, the meatballs will be large, maybe two inches in diameter. I am 
going to need some real flesh bombs to soothe me. Those little cocktail pellets 
will work no magic when I'm dealing with profound ennui.</p> 
<p>I scoop up a palm full of the meat mix, shape it, then roll it into a 
uniform ball. When I have finished balling up all the meat, I put the balls in 
the fridge for a few minutes.</p> 
<p>I can brown the meatballs in a pan then finish them off in the oven but I 
am not going that route. I'll brown them in the pan, then allow them to cook 
through while they swim in some kind of sauce. I take the meatballs six at a 
time and brown them in olive oil over medium high heat in a heavy pan. When a 
batch is finished, I remove it to a paper towel on a heated plate and start on 
the next batch.</p> 
<p>When all the meatballs are browned, a choice must be made. Something else 
is needed. The cloak.</p> 
<p>A sauce, a gravy of some sort.</p> 
<p>I am not about to retreat to the tried and true tomato sauce; I have been 
dealing with the mundane to the point of exhaustion and I refuse to opt for the 
lowest common denominator.</p> 
<p>I take the pan in which the meat is browned and I toss in a bit more olive 
oil and a mire poix - finely diced onion, carrot and celery. I saute the 
vegetables for a couple minutes then I add a handful of crushed tomato, cooking 
the tomato until it darkens and emits that oh-yeah-it's-caramelizing smell.</p> 
<p>Motivated by despair, I've opened an Australian shiraz and I'm working on 
my second glass of the stuff. It is cheap but drinkable, and I use some of it 
to deglaze my pan.</p> 
<p>In goes some thyme, black pepper, a touch of oregano, a bay leaf and two 
cups of sturdy beef broth.</p> 
<p>I have a bit of glace de viand on hand. Why not? In it goes and the 
concoction is reduced by two thirds over medium heat, with the seasonings 
boosted along the way.</p> 
<p>Back in go the meatballs, out comes the bay leaf. I could be prissy and 
strain the sauce, but in my angst-riddled state I don't care enough to do it. 
The dish simmers, covered, until the balls are cooked through. The sauce is 
syrupy and coats the meatballs. I steam a couple sweet potatoes and puree them, 
adding butter, a dab of honey, salt and pepper. I steam some green beans and 
dress them with butter, freshly ground black pepper and lemon juice.</p> 
<p>I pour another glass of the shiraz. I drink it and pour another. I drink it.
</p> 
<p>It's a swell meal.</p> 
<p>It improves my attitude.</p> 
<p>There's nothing like a meatball to make you yearn for winter.</p>

<p><b>Measures recommended to control BVD in cattle </b></p> 
<p><b>By Bill Nobles</b></p> 
<p><b>SUN Columnist</b></p> 
<p>Tuesday, Oct. 26 - 4-H Council elections, Extension building, 6 p.m.</p> 
<p>Bovine Virus Diarrhea (BVD) is a disease that affects cattle of all ages. 
In Colorado, more than 20 percent of cowherds are diagnosed with BVD annually, 
which has a devastating economic impact on the cattle industry.</p> 
<p>&quot;We've established the Colorado Voluntary BVD program earlier this 
year to control the disease,&quot; said Jim Kennedy, veterinarian at the 
Veterinary Diagnostic Lab in Rocky Ford, Colo. &quot;It's a multi-level program 
that encompasses biosecurity, vaccinations and strategic testing.&quot;</p> 
<p>Kennedy's position is a joint appointment between the Colorado Department 
of Agriculture and Colorado State University Veterinary Diagnostic Lab.</p> 
<p>BVD reduces productivity and increases death loss in a cattle herd. 
Clinical signs include ulcers in the lining of the mouth and intestines, 
diarrhea, lower weight gains and diminished reproductive performance. Within a 
herd, the effect can be seen through infertility, abortions, stillborn calves, 
birth deformities and calves that are persistently infected with the disease.
</p> 
<p>The financial impact of the disease is estimated to cost the rancher $10 to 
$24 per cow. With feeder cattle, one persistently infected animal can cause a 
loss of more than $10,000 per exposed pen. In Colorado, there are 2.4 million 
cattle and calves across the state.</p> 
<p>The Colorado Voluntary BVD program has three levels. For ranchers, the 
first step is to develop a quality biosecurity program that involves good 
herdsmanship, record keeping and appropriate vaccinations.</p> 
<p>In the second step, strategic testing is used to identify animals that are 
persistently infected, which is a primary source of BVD infection. This occurs 
when pregnant cows are exposed to the virus, and the unborn calf becomes 
infected. Usually the calves don't show signs of disease, but they shed the 
virus in such large amounts that even vaccinated members of the herd become 
infected. Ranchers can choose from a variety of testing procedures and options. 
The cost of attaining a Level 2 status is less than $150 plus the fees for 
sample collection.</p> 
<p>For ranchers to attain Level 3 status, their herds must be free of all 
persistently infected cattle. In addition to completing the requirements in the 
first two levels, individual tests must be completed on all animals in the 
herd. Eventually, all seedstock producers will be expected to provide 
documentation of the BVD status of the animals they sell.</p> 
<p>&quot;Vaccinations are an integral part of any control or eradication 
program but will not control the disease alone,&quot; said Kennedy. &quot;If 
testing protocols are carefully selected with goals established before testing 
begins, the additional cost to move from Level 2 to Level 3 should be 
minimal.&quot;</p> 
<p>Owners who complete the requirements of Level 3 are certified BVD PI free. 
This certification verifies that all cattle within the herd have been tested 
and have been found negative of BVD PI with the exception of any unborn calves. 
The calves are quarantined and tested immediately after birth.</p>

<p><b>Vandals leave Lake Pagosa</b></p> 
<p><b>pier with severe damage </b></p> 
<p><b>By Ming Steen</b></p> 
<p><b>SUN Columnist</b></p> 
<p>Last Friday afternoon, Oct. 15 at around 4 p.m., a property owner called 
the PLPOA office to report that children on bicycles were vandalizing the 
association-owned fishing pier at the dam at Lake Pagosa.</p> 
<p>These kids had taken some big rocks and smashed one of the floating dock 
sections; by the time a PLPOA employee arrived they had left the scene.</p> 
<p>This is a sad situation. The fishing piers are expensive items and were 
paid for by all of the property owners in Pagosa Lakes. The vandalized pier 
will be difficult to repair and once damaged to that extent, will never be 
quite as strong.</p> 
<p>If you know anything about this criminal act, please call the association 
office at 731-5635.</p> 
<p>And if, in the future, you see any suspicious activity at the pier or 
around any of the lakes, please inform the office and association employees 
will respond in person. Also notify the sheriff's office.</p> 
<p>The lakes and amenities are maintained for all property owners and their 
guests to enjoy and any and all acts of vandalism will cost us all dearly.</p> 
<p>Vandalism is a growing national problem. Last year this senseless crime 
cost United States citizens over $1 billion. Vandalism is a problem that gets 
to everyone in some form or another. It can affect your family, friends, 
property, community and your pocketbook.</p> 
<p>Who is a vandal?</p> 
<p>Over half of all crimes associated with vandalism occur in high schools. 
However, there is no typical vandal. Vandals can be good or bad students, girls 
or boys, white or black, rich or poor.</p> 
<p>The largest age group arrested for vandalism is between 13 and 14. However, 
children as young as six and seven vandalize schools and park areas. Teen-agers 
with growing-up problems act destructively by misusing vehicles, spray-painting 
graffiti on public places, etc. Older youths often commit more serious acts 
such as damaging vehicles or machinery, burglary, arson or theft.</p> 
<p>There are so many unanswered questions for me personally, that I will be 
seeking to educate myself on this issue. This most likely will not be the last 
time you'll read about vandalism in my column.</p> 
<p>I'd like to believe that for every single misdirected young person in our 
country, there are 50 or more good kids. These are the ones who go about their 
business of growing up, schooling, athletics, etc., quietly trying their best.
</p> 
<p>The refrain &quot;there's nothing for kids to do&quot; is not true. There 
are many avenues for our young people to get involved: school-sponsored 
activities, town-sponsored programs, service organization opportunities, church 
activities, and the list goes on. It would be more accurate to say that for 
some kids, the will or desire to get involved with positive developmental 
activities is lacking. And if it is lacking, what can parents do about it?</p> 
<p>I wish to acknowledge a group of youngsters who, last Sunday, spent the 
afternoon picking up trash in and around the core area of Pagosa Lakes. My 
thanks to Del Greer, Cela White, Kelsey Anderson, Rachel Jensen, Mackenzie 
Kitson, Teale Kitson and Sydney Aragon. The parents of these kids accompanied 
them and also helped with the roadway clean-up. Thank you parents for being 
positive partners for your children.</p> 
<p>This is the time of year to watch leaves fall, feel the weather turn cold 
and get all wrapped up with school fall sports. This is also the time of year 
to work on budgets, to project, to plan and to look forward to a good coming 
year.</p> 
<p>The Pagosa Lakes Property Owners Association's annual budget meeting will 
be held 1:30 p.m. Monday, Oct. 25 at the clubhouse.</p> 
<p>This is an open meeting ... come if you are interested in the process and 
wish to stay informed.</p>

<p><b>Pirate girls capture IML cross country laurels </b></p> 
<p><b>By Tess Noel Baker</b></p> 
<p><b>Staff Writer</b></p> 
<p>The Pagosa Pirates set the tone for a successful cross country post season 
Saturday by bringing home team first-place honors.</p> 
<p>The girls outdistanced Bayfield by one point to capture the league title 
and the top finish at the Monte Vista meet which included 3A, 2A and 1A schools.
</p> 
<p>&quot;We know each other well,&quot; coach Scott Anderson said of the 
Pirates and the Wolverines. &quot;We know we're going to face them the next two 
weekends and nobody is going to raise a white flag, but we feel the competition 
is only going to make us better going into the last two races of the year.&quot;
</p> 
<p>To claim the team title, the Pirates put three runners in the top five. The 
three crossed the finish back-to-back-to-back in third through fifth place. 
Leading the trio was junior Emilie Schur who crossed the finish in 20 minutes, 
47 seconds.</p> 
<p>Sophomore Laurel Reinhardt was just 11 seconds behind, claiming fourth. Two 
seconds behind her, sophomore Jessica Lynch claimed fifth.</p> 
<p>&quot;Laurel has been running well all year,&quot; Anderson said. 
&quot;Jessica is coming back to where she needs to be following an injury. They 
both ran a good race, but we'll be trying to squeeze a little more out of them 
over the next two weekends.&quot;</p> 
<p>Pagosa's fourth runner, and the third sophomore on the varsity, Jen 
Shearston, crossed the line in 22:06, finishing 12th.</p> 
<p>Junior Heather Dahm will round out the girl's varsity team for regionals 
and state this year. She finished 18th (22:26) in regional competition.</p> 
<p>Senior Rachel Watkins captured the alternate spot to state with a 
one-second victory over teammate Drie Young. Watkins finished the day 26th, in 
23:35. Young was 27th, in 23:36.</p> 
<p>The remainder of Pagosa's runners included: freshman Dell Greer (25:57); 
sophomore Julianna Whipple (26:46); senior Pau Alves (26:59); senior Esther 
Gordon (29:43); and freshman Mackenzie Kitson (34:40).</p> 
<p>Bayfield did edge out Pagosa - and everyone else - in individual 
competition. Wolverines Sari Sunblom and Steve Flint captured Runner of the 
Year awards by hitting the tape first in their varsity races.</p> 
<p>The Pagosa boys finished sixth overall at Monte Vista's invitational and 
third in the league.</p> 
<p>Senior Otis Rand crossed the line first for Pagosa, finishing 15th in 
19:05. He was followed by junior Orion Sandoval in 29th (19:33) and Riley Lynch 
in 32nd (19:54). Freshman Isaiah Warren took the fourth spot on Pagosa's team 
with a 20:51 showing, claiming 53rd. Junior Paul Hostetter, 55th, will round 
out the varsity for post-season competition, finishing in (20:53). Freshman 
Forrest Rackham will be the alternate. He finished in 24:11.</p> 
<p>Warren's time and performance are impressive for a freshman, Anderson said. 
&quot;He's dealing with the pressure well.&quot; The result may be yet another 
trip to state for the boys.</p> 
<p>&quot;We're right there on the bubble,&quot; Anderson said. &quot;I'm 
comfortable with where we sit, but we're right on the edge. Everybody's going 
to have to turn in a good race next week.&quot;</p> 
<p>The chances for both teams to make the trip to Colorado Springs later this 
month will be decided in a second week of races at Monte Vista Saturday.</p> 
<p>Regional action Oct. 23 begins at 9:30 a.m. for the girls and 10:15 a.m. 
for the boys. All races take place on the Monte Vista Municipal Golf Course, a 
fast, flat course especially suited for spectators.</p>

<p><b>Pirate kickers blank Telluride 3-0, extend winning streak to 10</b></p> 
<p><b>By Richard Walter</b></p> 
<p><b>Staff Writer</b></p> 
<p>Ten is a very definitive number, especially when it sets the latest 
parameter of a Pagosa Pirate soccer winning streak.</p> 
<p>It was reached in action Oct. 15 in Telluride when the Pirates blanked the 
much improved Miners 3-0 in a hard-fought Southwest Mountain League contest.</p>
<p>It was not the typical Pirate action in which they score early and then 
work ball possession and strategically impose their will on the opponent.</p> 
<p>Instead, Telluride came out in a strong defensive stance and Pagosa, though 
on the attack repeatedly, was not able to establish its normal offensive 
pattern.</p> 
<p>For example, in the first four minutes Pirate shots were going everywhere 
but in the net.</p> 
<p>Caleb Ormonde, on the first possession was stopped by Miner keeper Walter 
Kvale on a shot he nubbed. Moe Webb got the rebound and Kvale stopped him, too. 
Then, Webb was wide left on a reverse from the middle.</p> 
<p>So, the Pirates tried a new attack. Shan Webb's reverse header off a Kevin 
Blue corner kick popped off Kvale's gloves where Paul Muirhead got the rebound 
but fired wide left. Moe Webb's long drive on the short field hit a house 
behind the endline and Ormonde was stopped again by Kvale.</p> 
<p>Telluride's first shot, in the 22nd minute, was a blast by Lane Smith that 
was wide right.</p> 
<p>Shan Webb was blanked again and Ormonde stopped by Kvale off a corner kick.
</p> 
<p>Finally, at 28:31, Pagosa broke the scoring drought with senior midfielder 
Keagan Smith scoring from the right wing off a crossing pass from Shan Webb.</p>
<p>Then began the familiar litany of Pirate games - solo block by Levi Gill; 
two in a row.</p> 
<p>After a blast by Webb hit the right corner of the net and Smith was wide 
left with a rebound, Gill blocked the next two Miner attacks.</p> 
<p>At the 38 minute mark, Caleb Forrest got his first save for Pagosa on 
Telluride's first chance to get to goal, a looper by Jessie Lamb.</p> 
<p>Gill turned in another solo block, Moe Webb was wide right and Kevin Blue's 
direct kick from 25 yards sailed over the net before Webb, turned defender, 
blocked another Telluride shot.</p> 
<p>The Pirate frustration extended to a new name when Chris Baum's drive off a 
corner from Blue was stopped by Kvale as the first half ended.</p> 
<p>Gill opened the second half with another solo block, Jesse Morris was wide 
right on a header off a rebound and Blue, Ormonde and Moe Webb all were stopped 
by Kvale before Pagosa broke the drought.</p> 
<p>It came on a steal in the offensive zone by Ormonde who scored unassisted 
at 49:36 to increase the Pirate lead to 2-0 with a soft looper over Kvale's 
head.</p> 
<p>On the ensuing possession, Gill intercepted and fired from 30 only to see 
it go over the net.</p> 
<p>Moe Webb was wide left with a shot and then stopped on a breakaway by 
Telluride's Walker Tatum before he could get a shot off. Ormonde's header off a 
corner kick by Thomas Martinez was wide right and Muirhead's kick off the 
rebound went wide left.</p> 
<p>Another block by Gill led to a Pirate corner kick and Ormonde's shot hit 
the crossbar with Shan Webb wide left on the rebound effort.</p> 
<p>Then came four consecutive solo blocks by Gill before Forrest was called on 
for his second save.</p> 
<p>And then, at 62:16, Pagosa hiked the lead to 3-0 when Baum found Keagan 
Smith on right wing with a reverse drop and the senior drilled his second goal 
of the game and third of the season.</p> 
<p>Shan Webb was stopped by Kvale and Gill had a block. Forrest had a save on 
a soft roller and Moe Webb was stopped by Kvale. Gill had a block and Forrest 
his toughest save on a dive to his right for a shot by Lance Kipfer.</p> 
<p>Then it was Ormonde over the top, Shan Webb wide left and a solo block by 
Gill.</p> 
<p>And, as the game wore down, Keagan Smith was stopped, Max Smith had a steal 
and Baum's bid for his second goal of the season was over the top.</p> 
<p>For Pagosa it was a regular season 10-game winning streak after five 
consecutive losses to open the year, three against state ranked teams.</p> 
<p>The 9-1 league record tied them with Crested Butte for first place, each 
having defeated the other 3-2 in overtime on the home-team's field.</p> 
<p>Playoff times, dates and foes were yet to be decided (see separate story).

<p><b>Pirates get soccer scare from Center but win ninth straight </b></p> 
<p><b>By Richard Walter</b></p> 
<p><b>Staff Writer</b></p> 
<p>The Pagosa Springs Pirate soccer team reeled off its ninth victory in a row 
Oct. 14 in Center - but it wasn't easy.</p> 
<p>In fact, it was a nailbiter for an entirely scoreless second half, the 
Pirates protecting a 2-1 first-half lead against a savage Viking attack.</p> 
<p>As have many of the recent Pirate games, this one started with an early 
Pagosa lead thanks to the Webb brothers, Moe and Shan. And, but for an mistimed 
leap by Caleb Forrest, that might have held up as the game winner.</p> 
<p>It came just 2:47 into the contest when Shan Webb stole a Viking outlet 
pass at midfield, passed to older brother Moe, and then broke on the right wing 
for a return.</p> 
<p>Center's keeper came out to face Moe, the state's leading scorer in Class 
3A going into the contest. But Moe knew where Shan was and his cross to the 
right insured the goal.</p> 
<p>What became a fierce defensive struggle then continued for more than 13 
minutes. and it featured, among other things, four of the 14 solo blocks 
recorded in the game by Pirate senior sweeper Levi Gill.</p> 
<p>It also saw the Pirates struggle offensively, getting a lone shot on goal - 
by freshman Kevin Blue - in the 12-minute stretch.</p> 
<p>The game was knotted at 15:14 when Center's Moises Jeminez, the coach's 
son, looped a high soft drive on a free kick from 30 yards.</p> 
<p>Forrest, sure he had the ball, stayed planted but somehow misjudged the 
timing on his leap and the ball sailed over his 6-8 frame and into the upper 
right corner. </p> 
<p>That sent the Viking faithful into cheers of delight and spurred the squad 
into continued pressure on the Pirates.</p> 
<p>Again, it was almost 15 minutes before offense bested defense.</p> 
<p>In the interim, a mostly midfield scrum, Blue was stopped twice. Center's 
Carlos Marino and Clemente Sandoval each was stopped on breakaways by Forrest, 
and Gill picked up another solo block.</p> 
<p>Then, at 30:07, Pagosa took the lead it would never surrender. And again, 
it was the Webb brothers producing the goal.</p> 
<p>Moe Webb came out of midfield with a cross from Chris Baum and went wide 
left, suddenly stopping and dropping a cross to Shan.</p> 
<p>With the Center keeper charging right at him, Webb flicked it over his 
head, then swept past him for an unimpeded shot and the last goal of the game.
</p> 
<p>The balance of the half featured solo blocks by Chris Nobles and Gill and a 
save by Jesse Morris for Pagosa while Baldo Aguilera was wide left on one shot 
and over the top on another.</p> 
<p>At the half, Pirate coach Lindsey Kurt-Mason warned his squad to &quot;keep 
your heads. If you don't get a call you expect, keep on playing. You can't take 
anything for granted.&quot; </p> 
<p>And, he reminded them the game plan had been to use the middle of the field 
to establish pattern, see the field and play the lanes.</p> 
<p>But the second half started with Center showing the offensive thrust. 
Aguilera was stopped by Forrest on the opening play of the half and moments 
later a Center player's (no roster was given Pagosa or the press) shot on an 
indirect kick was over the net.</p> 
<p>After a solo block by Nobles, Center lost the ball at midfield to Pirate 
sophomore Caleb Ormonde who beat three defenders for an open shot that sailed 
high.</p> 
<p>Then the irrepressible Gill was credited with consecutive solo saves before 
Forrest made a fine diving stop on a shot by Sandoval.</p> 
<p>Three more blocks by Gill and a Center shot over the net followed.</p> 
<p>But the Vikings kept the pressure on and Forrest was called on to make 
three consecutive saves, the last tipping a blistering drive to his left and 
off the post to avoid the tying score.</p> 
<p>Back-to-back steals by Paul Muirhead opened Pirate scoring drives that were 
turned aside by Viking defenders.</p> 
<p>Two consecutive Viking drives ended with wide-right shots, followed by 
another Forrest save.</p> 
<p>The Pirates best scoring chance of the second half came next and a pretty 
three-man give-and-go attack.</p> 
<p>It started with Moe Webb slashing right up the middle, taking a blow from 
behind as he passed to Ormonde. The 6-4 sophomore looped a crossing pass to 
Blue racing the left wing, but his shot was wide left. He captured the Viking 
throw-in, however, and had another shot attempt thwarted by an interference 
calls on Center.</p> 
<p>Blue was awarded a direct kick from 35 yards but it, too, sailed to the 
left.</p> 
<p>Blocks by Shan Webb and Derek Monks stymied Viking attacks and then Ormonde 
was stopped from 20 yards on a header off a Muirhead cross.</p> 
<p>Another save by Forrest, two solo blocks by Gill and a Keagan Smith shot 
wide left preceded the only penalty of the game, a yellow card to Moe Webb with 
just 2:02 remaining. </p> 
<p>For Pagosa those two minutes were a drill in ball protection. Center would 
never get another shot and neither team was able to launch an offensive drive.
</p> 
<p>The victory hiked the Pirate record to 9-5 overall, 8-1 in the Southwest 
Mountain League with just a Friday contest in Telluride remaining in the 
regular season.</p>

<p><b>Pirate soccer champs will host quarterfinal; foe, date still unknown </b>
</p> 
<p><b>By Richard Walter</b></p> 
<p><b>Staff Writer</b></p> 
<p>The first tie-breaker - goals allowed against common league opponents - 
gave Pagosa Springs the championship and No. 1 seed in Southwest Mountain 
League soccer.</p> 
<p>As a result, the Pirates draw a regional round bye and will host a 
quarterfinal playoff game next week in Golden Peaks Stadium.</p> 
<p>The foe and the playing date and time will not be known until after a 
Sunday seeding meeting involving all 3A qualifiers statewide. What is known is 
that Pagosa will be in the top eight of the Sweet 16 and as such will draw a 
foe from the lower eight.</p> 
<p>The Pirates and Crested Butte each finished with 9-1 records in the league, 
the lone loss for each being a 3-2 overtime defeat by the other.</p> 
<p>The tie-breaker decision went to Pagosa, which allowed 12 goals in the 
league to 13 surrendered by Crested Butte. The third seed from the league will 
be Center, which finished 5-5 and will be on the road for regional play.</p> 
<p>State semifinals begin Nov. 6 with finals to be played Nov. 9.</p> 
<p>Pagosa's Moe Webb was the league's leading scorer with 23 goals this 
season. His brother, Shan, was second with 16.</p> 
<p>Both also ranked high in state lists with Moe second in Class 3A to Devin 
Gendreau of Weld Central (26) and Shan fourth with 16. Statewide, Moe finished 
fifth, behind Joel Trainer of Liberty in 4A with 28, Seth Benzinger of Montrose 
in 4A with 25 and Kyle Huntstiger of Durango in 5A with 24.</p>

<p><b>Pirates beat Bayfield, stay unbeaten in league play </b></p> 
<p><b>By Karl Isberg</b></p> 
<p><b>Staff Writer</b></p> 
<p>It was a short and basically sweet experience for the Pirate volleyball 
team, with a 3-0 victory over Bayfield Tuesday at the PSHS gym.</p> 
<p>The evening would have been shorter yet, if the Pirates had not lost their 
intensity in the third game of the 25-10, 25-11, 25-20 win.</p> 
<p>The sweetness will be complete should the Pirates manage to win their final 
Intermountain League victory of the season against Ignacio on the home court 
tonight.</p> 
<p>The win over the Wolverines gave Pagosa a 7-0 IML mark (12-4 overall) and 
assured them of the top seed at the district tournament a week from Friday in 
Ignacio.</p> 
<p>The first game flew by as the Pirates attacked relentlessly at the start, 
firing out to a 6- 1 lead with a solo block by senior middle Caitlyn Jewell, 
two kills by senior outside hitter Courtney Steen and an ace from junior 
Caitlin Forrest. Bayfield managed a two-point run before the Pirates went back 
to work, running off five consecutive points. Lori Walkup tipped for a score, 
Steen put another ball down from outside and Liza Kelley dumped a ball to the 
floor off a pass.</p> 
<p>All Bayfield could do was put together a single point at a time as Pagosa 
extended the advantage to 21-6. On the way, Kelley scored with a power dink to 
an empty spot in the Bayfield defense, Jewell went outside for a kill, Walkup 
crushed an errant Wolverine pass and that was followed by a similar play from 
Jewell. Kari Faber gave the team its 21st point with a kill. </p> 
<p>With Pagosa in front 23-7, Bayfield put three points on the board, only one 
of them earned. Walkup scored to take the serve back and Forrest served up an 
ace to end the game.</p> 
<p>Before the fans were settled in their seats, the Pirates had an 8-3 lead in 
the second game, all points but two handed over on Wolverine errors. Bri Scott 
scored one earned point in the spree with a kill from the middle, Steen the 
second point from outside. Scott scored again, Forrest mauled an over-pass and 
Jewell nailed a point. The Pirates were ahead 16-7</p> 
<p>Bayfield managed two points in a row, courtesy Pirate errors, with the one 
noticeable flaw in Pagosa's game - the service error - accounting for one of 
the points. The Pirates had 10 serve errors during the match.</p> 
<p>Jewell halted any Bayfield momentum with a solo block and Forrest killed 
for a point. Bayfield provided a charity point with a hitting error and Walkup 
made it 20-10 when she went to the right side for a cross-court attack.</p> 
<p>Bayfield managed one more point on another Pagosa serve mistake. Walkup 
killed, Bayfield gave away two points with errant hits, Jewell put the ball 
down from the middle and a Bayfield player crossed the line to end the second 
game.</p> 
<p>The serve error dogged the Pirates at the outset of the third game, with 
three mistakes surrendering points as Bayfield went ahead 5-3.</p> 
<p>Walkup responded by killing off the pass and Steen put a ball out off the 
Wolverine block. Steen then stepped up to crush a ball down the line and Pagosa 
was ahead, 6-5.</p> 
<p>It didn't last. The teams tied all the way to 11-11 when the Wolverines 
surrendered a point with a ball hit out to knot the score then committed a 
second error to put the Pirates ahead. Faber then gave her team a 13-11 lead 
with a successful attack from the left side.</p> 
<p>Pagosa managed a four-point run and looked to be on the way to the win. 
Walkup scored, Forrest served an ace, Jewell and Walkup stuffed a Bayfield 
hitter and Walkup put a ball down from the right side. The Pirates led 17-12.
</p> 
<p>The teams exchanged two-point runs, then single points. Pagosa was up 
20-15, but there was no quit in the Wolverines. Bayfield scored four points in 
a row, the first on a serve error, the second on a ball hit out by the Pirates, 
the third and fourth points on aces muffed by a sluggish Pirate back row. 
Bayfield trailed by one point but could not sustain the effort: A Wolverine 
serve error gave up a point and Forrest came back with a kill.</p> 
<p>Bayfield saw its final point go up on the board when a Pirate committed a 
line violation. It appeared the Wolverines would score again as their serve hit 
the tape at the top of the net and rolled to the Pirates' side. Walkup got a 
tremendous up on the ball and Liza Kelley powered a kill to the floor on the 
Bayfield side of the net. Jewell followed with a kill to the back line and 
Kelley ended it all with an attack from the right side.</p> 
<p>&quot;We started strong,&quot; said coach Penn&eacute; Hamilton, &quot;but 
we kind of fizzled at the end. Our hitting was better tonight and we'll need it 
when we play Ignacio Thursday (tonight). Against Ignacio we've got to get our 
block up, especially on the outside. And we have to ready for any kind of ball 
coming back at us. We need to hit the ball with authority on offense.&quot;</p> 
<p>The Pirates and the Bobcats meet tonight with C team matches beginning at 7 
p.m. The Pirates finish the regular season schedule at Montrose Saturday, 
playing 4A Montrose at 9 a.m. and 3A Olathe immediately after.</p>

<p><b>Pirates take fifth IML match at Monte Vista </b></p> 
<p><b>By Karl Isberg</b></p> 
<p><b>Staff Writer</b></p> 
<p>The Pirates continued their unbeaten streak in the Intermountain League 
Friday night with a 3-0 win at Monte Vista.</p> 
<p>The only question during the match was how many earned points Monte Vista 
would put on the board before the action ended.</p> 
<p>The answer was not many, as Pagosa ended the brief affair 25-9, 25-15, 
25-18 allowing the hosts only 16 earned scores in Monte's total 42 match points.
</p> 
<p>Pagosa owned the net during the match, beating Monte with height and 
strength, allowing few direct attacks on the Pirate defense.</p> 
<p>The Pirate attack was on track much of the time, led by senior middle 
hitters Caitlyn Jewell and Bri Scott, and senior outside hitter Courtney Steen.
</p> 
<p>Scott led the way in the first game, converting effectively from the middle 
against a weak Monte Vista block. Scott scored with four kills and added 
another two points with blocks.</p> 
<p>Steen accounted for three points with two kills and a tip.</p> 
<p>Jewell crushed a Monte overpass at the start of the game then wrapped 
things up at game's end with scores on two kills and one solo block.</p> 
<p>Lori Walkup added two kills to the Pirate total; Kari Faber put a ball to 
the floor from outside. Steen served for seven points in mid game.</p> 
<p>Pagosa shot out to a 4-0 lead in the second game with Jewell beginning the 
run with a kill of an errant Monte Vista pass.</p> 
<p>Walkup ended the run with an ace. She and Jewell killed for points on the 
way to a 16-3 lead; Jewell served two aces as well.</p> 
<p>An exchange of points on mistakes and a kill by Scott gave the Pirates the 
18-4 advantage.</p> 
<p>The inevitable was delayed slightly as Pagosa surrendered a number of 
points with miscues but Jewell slid to the outside for a kill and Liza Kelley 
hit an ace to extend the Pirate lead to 23-12. Monte got points on serve and 
setting errors but gave away the last two points to Pagosa with hitting and 
passing mistakes.</p> 
<p>Pagosa took the lead 3-0 in the third game with an ace by Kari Faber 
putting one of the points on the scoreboard.</p> 
<p>Steen killed for a fourth point and the teams exchanged scores with errors 
before Faber put a ball to the floor from outside to give her team an 8-4 
advantage.</p> 
<p>Kelley stepped up for a kill, Faber tipped for a point and the Pirates were 
in front 12-7.</p> 
<p>Steen scored twice - once on a successful back-row attack - Monte continued 
to misfire on its side of the net and Pagosa was up 18-9.</p> 
<p>In their one solid run of the night, the Monte players scored three 
consecutive points with a kill, a free ball to the back line and a solo block.
</p> 
<p>Kelley cut the march short, however, dumping the ball off the pass to an 
empty spot on the floor and Scott followed up with a kill from the middle.</p> 
<p>Monte scored six more points - five unearned. For Pagosa, Steen killed from 
outside and tipped for a point; Scott came up big again and, with her team 
ahead 24-18, Walkup put a precise shot to the back corner of the court to end 
game and match.</p> 
<p>&quot;The girls came out strong and dominated the first game,&quot; said 
coach Penn&eacute; Hamilton. &quot;They pretty much shut Monte Vista down. Each 
game got a bit closer, but most of it was due to our own errors.&quot;</p> 
<p>Hamilton's concern about the low ceiling and rafters at the Monte Vista gym 
was relayed to her players before the match. &quot;I warned them about the 
ceiling,&quot; she said. &quot;In general, we handled it better than they 
did.&quot;</p> 
<p>The quality and tempo of league play is improving as the season ends and 
Monte Vista did some things in the home gym they did not do when they played at 
Pagosa.</p> 
<p>&quot;They blocked a few balls,&quot; said Hamilton of Monte Vista. 
&quot;The higher the level of our play, the deeper into the season we get, the 
more other teams will block and dig our attacks. We need to transition right 
into our offense - do something with the pass and hit at them again.&quot;</p> 
<p>The Pirates play their final IML match of the regular season tonight, Oct. 
21, against Ignacio in the PSHS gym.</p> 
<p>The action starts with C team matches at 4 p.m.</p> 
<p>Saturday, Pagosa is on the road at Montrose for a 9 a.m. match against the 
4A Indians and a match immediately after with 3A Olathe. Those contests end the 
regular season schedule.</p>

<p><b>Pirates trampled by Mean Moose in 41-19 loss </b></p> 
<p><b>By Tom Carosello</b></p> 
<p><b>Staff Writer</b></p> 
<p>Will the real Pagosa Springs Pirates please stand up?</p> 
<p>One week after looking like title contenders and playing with controlled 
rage to hand Intermountain League foe Monte Vista its first setback of the 
season, the Pirates came out as flat as the San Luis Valley Friday at Alamosa 
and got trampled by the Mean Moose in a 41-19 loss.</p> 
<p>Though little went as planned for head coach Sean O'Donnell's squad, one of 
the game's few positives is the fact the nonconference loss had no bearing on 
Pagosa's playoff hopes or grip on first place in the IML.</p> 
<p>However, as O'Donnell told his 5-2 team after the defeat, if the Pirates 
want to win the IML title outright to ensure they host a first-round game of 
the Class 2A playoffs, the snooze button must remain out of reach for the rest 
of the season.</p> 
<p>Early on, it appeared the contest would be another low-scoring affair as 
both teams struggled to find an offensive rhythm.</p> 
<p>But near the end of the scoreless first frame, sluggish coverage from 
Pagosa allowed Alamosa's Jason Espinoza to return a punt to the Mean Moose 
47-yard line, and the home team posted a 6-0 lead with two minutes gone in the 
second quarter after Espinoza took a sweep 40-yards to the end zone.</p> 
<p>Alamosa's point-after kick missed wide left, but the Pirates failed to gain 
a first down on their next possession and were back-pedaling again after 
Espinoza returned the resulting punt to the Pagosa 7.</p> 
<p>Alamosa's Sonny Yohn tiptoed into the end zone one play later, and the Mean 
Moose led 14-0 after a two-point conversion toss from Clay Garcia to Dustin 
Bolt.</p> 
<p>The Pirates briefly showed signs of life on their next possession as Josh 
Hoffman returned the Mean Moose kickoff to the Pagosa 37, then quarterback Paul 
Armijo hit wideout Jordan Shaffer for a first-down gain to the Alamosa 49.</p> 
<p>But Espinoza stepped in front of an errant pass on the next snap, returning 
it for a 50-yard touchdown and Alamosa led 21-0 after a successful point-after 
kick by Michael Gallegos with 8:30 to play in the half.</p> 
<p>Pagosa would answer with a ground attack on its next drive, and was able 
cut the lead to 21-7 on a 60-yard scoring run from Armijo followed by Daniel 
Aupperle's point-after kick at 6:24.</p> 
<p>A roughing the punter call on fourth and long enabled the Mean Moose to 
extend their next drive to the Pirate red zone, but the march ended at the 17 
when Pagosa's Juan Martinez pounced on a fumble to give the Pirates a late 
chance with 1:49 to play.</p> 
<p>The Pirates went into hurry-up mode, and Armijo carried twice to move the 
ball into Mean Moose territory, then threw to flanker Paul Przybylski racing 
down the Alamosa sideline for a 45-yard touchdown to get Pagosa back in the 
game with 49 seconds to play.</p> 
<p>Then came a delayed, curious call from the officiating crew - with both 
teams lined up for the extra-point attempt, the officials huddled momentarily 
near the 15-yard line, then littered the field with penalty flags.</p> 
<p>To the delight of Alamosa fans, Pagosa's touchdown was subsequently 
disallowed, apparently because game officials had suddenly realized Przybylski 
had been bumped out of bounds before receiving Armijo's pass, and in doing so 
became an ineligible receiver.</p> 
<p>The call led to a disheartening chain of events for Pagosa as six points 
came off the scoreboard, Pirate fans erupted in stark protest, Alamosa 
intercepted on the next play and the half ended with a crestfallen Pagosa team 
trailing by 14. </p> 
<p>Bad news for the Pirates continued early in the second half - after holding 
Pagosa to three and out, the Mean Moose took a 27-7 lead two minutes into the 
third quarter on a 15-yard touchdown pass from Garcia to Bolt.</p> 
<p>Then the Pirates got a lift when junior Bubba Martinez blocked the 
extra-point attempt, and gained further momentum when Hoffman returned the 
kickoff to the Alamosa 38. </p> 
<p>The Pirates converted a fourth and two to keep their scoring chance alive, 
Armijo hit Shaffer at the 2 to set up first and goal, and Craig Schutz snared a 
fourth-and-goal pass from Armijo to trim the lead to 27-13 at 4:20.</p> 
<p>But Alamosa's Derek Russel blocked the PAT, and the Mean Moose answered 
with a nine-play, 68-yard scoring drive capped by a 30-yard touchdown run by 
Yohn to give the home team a 34-13 lead with under a minute to play in the 
third.</p> 
<p>The final quarter was no kinder to Pagosa - Alamosa tallied its final 
points of the game with a blocked punt for a touchdown just 47 seconds in, 
Gallegos kicked the PAT and the Mean Moose led by 28.</p> 
<p>The Pirates got a touchdown with 13 seconds to play on a 62-yard pass from 
backup quarterback Adam Trujillo to Przybylski, but the game ended 41-19 in 
favor of the Mean Moose after Pagosa misfired on a two-point conversion try.</p>
<p>Armijo totaled 133 yards rushing on 14 carries in the loss, while Hoffman 
added 66 yards on 18 totes. Bubba Martinez recorded eight tackles to lead the 
defense, followed by Armijo with six and Jake Reding with five.</p> 
<p>When asked if he felt his team was physically dominated during the contest, 
&quot;I don't think we were dominated physically, but they were certainly 
prepared to play much better than we were,&quot; said O'Donnell after the game.
</p> 
<p>&quot;I take a lot of the blame for that; we were probably not as focused 
this week during practice as we should've been,&quot; he added.</p> 
<p>&quot;And when you play a good football team like Alamosa, you can't wait 
to decide the game should mean something to you, even if it's nonconference, 
then make as many mistakes as we did and expect to compete,&quot; said 
O'Donnell.</p> 
<p>With regard to his team's final two IML games of the season, &quot;The 
bottom line is, if we don't win our next two games, we're not league champs and 
we don't get to host a playoff game,&quot; said the coach.</p> 
<p>&quot;And our kids definitely know that, so hopefully we can get back to

<p><b>Seeing youth sports at purest level </b></p> 
<p><b>By Joe Lister Jr.</b></p> 
<p><b>SUN Columnist</b></p> 
<p>The rest rooms in Town Park and South Pagosa Park will close this week.</p> 
<p>Each year we blow out all the water lines to prevent freezing at the public 
facilities.</p> 
<p>We continue to offer 24-hour rest room services at the Bell Tower Park. 
This facility is geothermally heated and is in a great location for the public.
</p> 
<p><b>South Pagosa Park </b></p> 
<p>All the improvements by the park crew and volunteers has started the ball 
rolling on more improvements.</p> 
<p>We had $5,000 budgeted for resurfacing some of the boxes. We plan to finish 
this phase of the resurfacing by late October. After reviewing the 2004 budget, 
and seeing the progress and local help, we have ordered more surface material 
to cover the remaining boxes in the park.</p> 
<p>We are expecting the new materials to be delivered within the next couple 
of weeks. Anyone wishing to help set up another work day, please call me at 
264-4151, Ext. 231.</p> 
<p><b>Recreation</b></p> 
<p>The recreation department is winding down toward our annual youth soccer 
tournament. All games will be played at the elementary school fields, so come 
support youth soccer. The finals are scheduled to start at 11:30 a.m. Saturday, 
Oct. 30.</p> 
<p>I observed one of my most enjoyable weeks of soccer in Pagosa last week. It 
started Saturday at the Town Park, watching the 5- and 6-year-olds, playing the 
game in its purest form: running, laughing, waving, and sometimes even going 
the right direction.</p> 
<p>One of the teams had a lasagna lunch for the players after a season-ending 
game. Every team went undefeated this season, there were no losers.</p> 
<p>Watching the young athletes walking around with a participation medal 
around their necks brought a smile to my face.</p> 
<p>Then, up to the elementary fields to watch the older kids play. There are 
many kids who play on a traveling team. We did not have enough players to play 
the visiting Dulce team so Myles called together enough players to accommodate 
our neighbors from the south with a practice game against the children who 
didn't travel.</p> 
<p>It ended in a tie, with an overtime, and then a five-player shootout. 
Watching the kids play with no pressure, just having fun, again reminded me the 
game is for the kids, and kids will develop their level of fun if we just leave 
them alone.</p> 
<p>Then, on Monday night, I experimented with watching from far away from the 
stadium, far enough were I could not hear any of the commands given the kids by 
parents and coaches. I witnessed my son, Gabe, running, joking and just loving 
the fact that he was participating in a great sport with his friends and peers. 
It was like watching your favorite movie, with your child in a starring role.
</p> 
<p>His body language was that of a child enjoying the true nature of 
recreational sport. So, my suggestion to you is try backing off and just 
watching, maybe even put headphones on so you do not hear anything. You too 
will see your child just being a kid. It is quite rewarding.</p> 
<p><b>Complaints, suggestions</b></p> 
<p>If you are a parent, grandparent or coach and have a complaint or 
suggestion please come to our organizational meetings, or if you have 
complaints call our offices. If you need to talk to us, our doors are always 
open.</p> 
<p>Please do not complain or make a scene on the fields, in front of the 
children, where we as adults are modeling behavior for our children. We can 
learn from each other, then educate our children on the whats, ifs and whys of 
recreational sports rules and regulations.</p> 
<p>Please call 264-4151, Ext. 231, for an appointment.</p>

<p><b>Bill of Rights for young athletes</b></p> 
<p>The Bill of Rights for young athletes was developed in the 1980s by Dr. 
Vern Seefeldt, professor emeritus at the Institute for the Study of Youth 
Sports, and Dr. Rainier Martens, in response to growing concerns regarding the 
abuse of young athletes in the hope of creating guidelines to maximize the 
beneficial effects of athletic participation for all.</p> 
<p>This bill has been used by a number of national organizations as a 
guideline for administrators, coaches and parents:</p> 
<p>1. Right to participate in sports;</p> 
<p>2. Right to participate at a level commensurate with each child's maturity 
and ability;</p> 
<p>3. Right to have qualified adult leadership;</p> 
<p>4. Right to play as a child and not as an adult;</p> 
<p>5. Right of children to share in the leadership and decision-making of 
their sport participation;</p> 
<p>6. Right to participate in safe and healthy environments;</p> 
<p>7. Right to proper preparation for participation in sports;</p> 
<p>8. Right to an equal opportunity to strive for success;</p> 
<p>9. Right to be treated with dignity; and</p> 
<p>10. Right to have FUN in sports.</p>

<p> </p> <b>Editorial</b> <b>Take our time </b> 
<p>The 2004 general election is underway, with early voting taking place and 
absentee ballots being sent out. Early voting began Monday and continues at the 
county clerk's office until 4 p.m. Oct. 29. Many absentee voters have received 
their ballots and have until Nov. 2 to return them.</p> 
<p>Registered voters can request absentee ballots to be mailed to them up to 
Oct. 26 and can pick up absentee ballots at the county clerk's office until 
Oct. 29.</p> 
<p>The more the merrier. Anyone registered to vote should participate - if not 
voting early or absentee, they should show up at the polls Nov. 2. In 
particular, those young people who are registered to vote in their first 
general election, or their first presidential election, should make a point of 
exercising their right.</p> 
<p>There is plenty on the voters' plates this year.</p> 
<p>First, a contentious and apparently close presidential race. </p> 
<p>Second, a Colorado Senate seat up for grabs, fought for by Democrat Ken 
Salazar and Republican Peter Coors. </p> 
<p>Democrat John Salazar is slugging it out with Republican Greg Walcher for 
the right to represent our U.S. congressional district.</p> 
<p>Republican Robin Schiro and Independent Nan Rowe are contending for the 
Archuleta County Commission seat from District 1.</p> 
<p>County voters living within the boundaries of the San Juan Water 
Conservancy District will decide whether to provide funds to purchase land for 
a reservoir. All voters in the county will have a say on whether to retain 
District Court judges Greg Lyman and Jefferey Wilson as well as several Appeals 
Court judges.</p> 
<p>There are four initiatives proposing amendments to the Colorado 
Constitution. They are joined there by two referendums urging changes to the 
constitution. The topics range widely, from an amendment dealing with 
construction liability to an increase in tobacco tax, from a proposed change in 
the way the state's electoral votes are designated to a renewable energy 
proposal, from changes to the state personnel system to removal of obsolete 
constitutional elements.</p> 
<p>We will pick a regent for the University of Colorado.</p> 
<p>All in all, quite a load.</p> 
<p>A load that demands study in order to make informed and intelligent choices.
</p> 
<p>Many voters have probably made up their minds, picked their candidates, 
decided how they will vote on the state ballot measures. A lamentable number of 
votes flow from unexamined partisan reasons, and many of those votes will be 
cast before Nov. 2, if they have not been cast by the time you read this.</p> 
<p>We tend to agree with our colleagues at The Denver Post. In an Oct. 18 Post 
editorial, it was noted that, while the option to vote early is inviting, 
perhaps this is one election year when it is wise to wait. Until Nov. 2.</p> 
<p>The races for president, U.S. Senate and House are in a state of flux, for 
all but the blindered partisan voter. It is hard to predict what information 
might yet surface in the presidential race, what events might take place prior 
to Nov. 2 that could tempt the uncommitted voter to lean one way or the other. 
The same can be said of our Senate and House races; there is time yet for 
change in the picture. Our local race for county commissioner has the potential 
for new and surprising turns before Election Day. Those who voted early the 
first three days of this week missed our candidate interviews in this issue. 
Did one of the candidates say something that might have caused a vote to be 
changed, had the voter waited?</p> 
<p>Granted, the crush at the polling place on Election Day can be tedious. 
True, the trip demands some extra effort.</p> 
<p>But, maybe this is the year we should take our time.</p>

<p><b>I flu through the line in 2 hours</b></p> 
<p><b>By Richard Walter</b></p> 
<p><b>Staff Writer</b></p> 
<p>Oh yeah! Sure. I was going to get there early, grab a spot in the line 
before the crowd gathered, and then be back at work in 45 minutes or so.</p> 
<p>Great plan!</p> 
<p>Except that several hundred others had the same idea Monday for the one and 
only flu shot clinic to be held in Pagosa Springs - to the best of our 
knowledge.</p> 
<p>Granted, San Juan Basin Health planned well for the clinic, picking the 
most logical place, Pagosa Springs Community Center, that could handle a crowd 
that size.</p> 
<p>They even started a little early because of the huge crowd which had 
gathered and the fact many were disabled.</p> 
<p>They had seating inside for 180 people and the seats were filled all the 
time as people shuttled in and out.</p> 
<p>The health department, of course, had no control over the weather and many 
of us stood outside in the rain for up to half an hour waiting just to get 
inside the door.,</p> 
<p>Then there was another wait to get into the gymnasium where the shots were 
being administered.</p> 
<p>Now why would a pacer put himself in that kind of situation?</p> 
<p>Well, I've got to admit I have gotten flu shots as long as they've been 
available, and I've never had a case of the flu.</p> 
<p>And, much as I dislike the idea, I'm now in that group of older Americans 
who were recommended as most in need of the shots.</p> 
<p>The fact that an overseas producer shorted the U.S. 48 million doses by 
allowing its production facilities to be contaminated and causing the 
medication to be banned had nothing to do with it.</p> 
<p>I'm just having too much fun in life to want to be knocked down by some 
foreign bug with a quivering sticker.</p> 
<p>I'd never get to see the fallen leaves gather in the parks and on the 
country trails. I'd never get to see the state high school sports playoff 
action. I'd be reduced to a stay-at-home statistic if I got the flu and 
couldn't go out because I might transmit it to someone else.</p> 
<p>And, I was cognizant of the fact that Colorado was the worst hit state in 
the nation last year, per capita. I wanted no part in setting a new record.</p> 
<p>Still, standing in the rain and then waiting another 45 minutes inside 
triggered thoughts of &quot;this is a good way to get the flu.&quot;</p> 
<p>There were other factors which made it a wise decision. I got to see a 
number of old friends I don't always visit with.</p> 
<p>I got to kibitz with Sheriff Tom Richards and his wife, Wyoma, teasingly 
chastising him for referring to her as &quot;Granny,&quot; and I exchanged 
early Pagosa memories with Dewey Lattin.</p> 
<p>An older woman preceding me in line was livid that both young children and 
the older people were brought to the same place at the same time. She felt they 
should have been seen at different times.</p> 
<p>Capt. Mencor Valdez, also of the sheriff's staff, joked that neither he nor 
I could claim we were &quot;gone fishin,&quot; something we once did with 
regularity as youngsters in Pagosa Country.</p> 
<p>The quickest part of the day was the shot. </p>

<p>Last week saw the start of the big game season with probably more hunters 
in this area than in previous years. There were slightly more than 1,500 
licenses sold here in town by the first of the week. With better than a week of 
hunting season still left there will undoubtedly be more hunters arriving and 
there should be considerably more game taken. If it should snow, much of the 
game will be forced to lower altitudes and the kill will increase greatly.</p>

<p><b>The Twin Towers </b> </p> 
<p><b>Astronomers, volunteers prepare for lunar standstill at Chimney Rock </b>
</p> 
<p><b>By Tess Noel Baker</b></p> 
<p><b>Staff Writer</b></p> 
<p>The mystery of the people who inhabited Chimney Rock 1,000 years ago isn't 
going away anytime soon. </p> 
<p>It's part of the romance, the pull, the intrigue of the archeological area 
15 miles west and three miles south of Pagosa Springs and the two rock towers 
that mark its place.</p> 
<p>The people of Chimney Rock left behind no writing, no pictures, no 
libraries to help us understand their culture, only the pieces of what they 
ate, what tools they used, what clothing they wore and some of the buildings 
they constructed. They arrived sometime around 1050 A.D. and left about 100 
years later. The why is left to the imagination - and science.</p> 
<p>Starting late this year and continuing through 2008, nature will put on a 
display that forms the basis of one of the scientific theories on Chimney Rock 
- that it could have been a place of pilgrimage and of trade for the people of 
Chaco Canyon, a large community 93 miles south as the crow flies, and perhaps 
more importantly, the source of a calendar to unite a growing number of small 
outliers.</p> 
<p>Dr. Kim Malville, an astronomer with the University of Colorado-Boulder, 
who first proposed a link between Chimney Rock and important dates reflected in 
the skies above, stopped in Pagosa Springs Tuesday to talk about the connection 
he first demonstrated in 1988, the last time the moon rose between the two rock 
spires as seen only from the Great House Pueblo on the high mesa 1,000 feet 
above the valley floor.</p> 
<p>Both the moon and the sun rise at different places along the horizon 
throughout the year. These occur at regular, predictable intervals that can be 
used to create a calendar. For instance, the cycle between full moons takes 
about a month. The sun will rise at the same point on the horizon each year on 
the solstice and equinox dates, marking the longest and shortest days of the 
year.</p> 
<p>The moon also has a longer cycle. Every 18.6 years, the moon travels from 
north to south along the horizon, actually outdistancing the sun at the far 
ends. When it reaches these extremes, it pauses for several years and then 
starts the journey back the other way. The pauses are called standstills, and 
specifically, the northern standstill may have been marked by ancient people 
living at Chimney Rock.</p> 
<p>Back in 1988, Malville said, he and some graduate students climbed up the 
steep, rocky trail to see if his theory about the moon rising between the rocks 
during the northern standstill could hold true. Each had two or three cameras 
to capture the event.</p> 
<p>&quot;At about 2 a.m. I and a number of skeptical students of mine saw a 
very brilliant, diamondlike bit of light appearing between the double 
Chimneys,&quot; he said. Only one of the cameras captured a readable image. 
Still, it proved the geometry was correct, added credibility to the idea it was 
possible a thousand years ago other people could have marked the same event and 
interpreted it as important.</p> 
<p>Malville pointed to known activity on the site during the lunar cycles as 
further food for thought.</p> 
<p>According to archaeologists, agriculturalists began moving into what is now 
southwest Colorado sometime in the 1050s, probably ascending the slopes above 
Stolsteimer Creek to attempt dryland farming.</p> 
<p>In 1054, although near the end of its cycle, the moon would have still been 
rising between the two pillars as seen from the high mesa, a natural 
observatory, Malville said.</p> 
<p>Around the same time, the Taurus Supernova appeared. It was so bright, it 
could be seen in the sky during the day for almost two weeks. &quot;Next to the 
sun and the moon, it would have been the brightest thing in the sky,&quot; 
Malville said. Still the people didn't seem to take much notice. &quot;We have 
no idea whether they noted it or whether it changed their lives or not.&quot;
</p> 
<p>What evidence they might have left has been covered up. Sometime in the 
1930s, the Forest Service built a fire tower right on top of what was a fire 
pit used by long-ago people, scraping away remnants of activity there.</p> 
<p>&quot;People seemed to go on with their ordinary lives,&quot; Malville 
said, &quot;with perhaps some kind of cultural memory of the event.&quot;</p> 
<p>Then, in 1074, the moon would have appeared again between the pillars. 
Perhaps it was then, Malville said, that word of the events reached Chaco 
Canyon. At least, tree-ring dating of wood found inside the East Kiva of the 
Chacoan Great House - the largest building at Chimney Rock - which stands on 
the high mesa, puts initial construction about 1076 A.D. It also marks Chimney 
Rock as perhaps the earliest of a series of 100 to 150 outliers connected to 
the larger community at Chaco.</p> 
<p>Other dateable material shows the Great House Pueblo at Chimney Rock was 
rebuilt around 1093, at another time when the moon was rising between the 
spires.</p> 
<p>Malville said evidence in Chaco Canyon sites points to the people 
rebuilding or reconstructing their kivas or ceremonial sites about every 20 
years - &quot;or perhaps every 18.6 years,&quot; Malville said. &quot;Perhaps 
this was some sort of ceremonial or rebuilding ritual the people went 
through,&quot; he added.</p> 
<p>At any rate, the Great House Pueblo at Chimney Rock was not easy to build. 
Each stone, timber and chinking had to be carried from the valley floor. And it 
is unmistakably Chacoan in style, Malville said. It was also protected in 
someway by a second structure that would have blocked the causeway to the great 
house. People stationed there would have easily been able to control access to 
the site if ceremonies or rituals were taking place. </p> 
<p>Another mystery is a series of houses built along the winding trail to the 
top of the mesa. With steep dropoffs on both sides and constant traffic, 
&quot;this would have been no place to raise a family,&quot; Malville said. He 
suggested that perhaps these were the dwellings of the builders, the 
contractors of sorts who traveled from Chaco to Chimney Rock to set up this 
&quot;observatory.&quot;</p> 
<p>Then, around 1125, the people closed that chapter of their lives, leaving 
both Chimney Rock and Chaco Canyon for other destinations. Perhaps they left 
much behind, for the lunar ties to the heavens are just the beginning of what 
could have been happening at Chimney Rock.</p> 
<p>Archeologists also uncovered a stone basin ground into the bedrock at 
Chimney Rock. The man-made depression is located near the Great Kiva and other 
structures below the great house.</p> 
<p>&quot;This is the only bedrock basin of this sort found outside Chaco 
Canyon,&quot; Malville said. And, anyone standing at the stone basin on the 
morning of the summer solstice can see the sun come up over the north wall of 
the Great House Pueblo above. The location of the Supernova in 1054 - before 
the great house was built - is exactly in line with the south wall of the great 
house with the walls meeting at the site of the stone basin if projected that 
far.</p> 
<p>Along a nearby ridge, called Peterson Gulch Ridge or the Piedra Overlook, 
is yet another series of buildings with ties to the skies.</p> 
<p>The largest structure on that ridge, Malville said, is exactly due west of 
the two rocks. Each year, on the March 21 and September 21 equinoxes, the sun 
rises between the pillars as seen from the site of that structure. At different 
times during the year, the sun can be seen rising between the rocks from homes 
built all along that ridge. As seen from the southernmost structure, the 
chimneys line up, one on top of the other, and the sun rises above them on the 
summer solstice.</p> 
<p>Could these events have all been missed? Could it have been mere 
circumstances that aligned these buildings with the sky? Or did these people 
use their architecture to create a calendar of sorts? Was this the place that 
let people know when to travel to certain festivals, when to plant, when to 
celebrate? Was this a copy of the heavens on earth? Was it a place for people 
to ascend closer to the heavens, closer to the things that were at the 
spiritual center of their lives?</p> 
<p>It's all speculation today, part of a mystery that will most likely never 
be solved. But starting this year, people can once again see the moon rise 
between the rocks and think, even believe, the possibilities.</p> 
<p>&quot;I think it will be a remarkable experience,&quot; Malville said. 
&quot;Almost a kind of contact with the people who lived here before.&quot;</p> 
<p>Starting with the Winter Solstice Dec. 26 and 27, the moon will rise 
between the rocks in different phases, from full moon to new moon and back, a 
couple times each month for three or four years.</p> 
<p>Sometimes this will actually happen in the daylight. Other times it happen

<p><b>Tierra Amarilla land grant</b></p> 
<p><b>covered part of this county</b></p> 
<p><b>By John M. Motter</b></p> 
<p><b>SUN Columnist</b></p> 
<p>The expansion of settled territory in New Mexico prior to the 1846 U.S. 
takeover of that territory was accomplished by issuing land grants. Land grants 
were issued by Spain prior to Mexico becoming an independent nation in 1822, 
and by the Mexican government after 1822.</p> 
<p>After the U.S. occupied New Mexico by military force in 1846, and as a 
condition of governing the newly acquired territory, the U.S. agreed to 
recognize qualified land grants.</p> 
<p>The only one of those grants directly affecting Archuleta County and Pagosa 
Country was the Tierra Amarilla Land Grant. We sometimes hear talk of land 
grant property in Archuleta County other than the T.A. grant, but no such 
grants ever existed.</p> 
<p>Reams of material have been written about the T.A. grant which, by fair 
means or foul, ended up in the control of Thomas Catron, a New Mexico lawyer 
who was the largest land owner in the U.S. for some time. He was a member and 
probably headed the infamous Santa Fe Ring, a group of U.S. transplants in New 
Mexico who managed to acquire large land grant acreages following the 
Mexican-American War.</p> 
<p>A reading of Archuleta County properties recorded in the courthouse will 
reveal a large number of entries by Catron prior to 1900. All of the entries 
are connected with the T.A. grant.</p> 
<p>As originally conceived, the T.A. grant included an area bounded by the Las 
Nutritas River on the south, the Navajo River on the north, the crest of 
mountains forming the skyline on the east, and a north-south line roughly 
following today's U.S. 84 on the west.</p> 
<p>The first petition for the T.A. grant was made in 1814 by Marcial Montoya 
and others while Mexico and New Mexico were ruled by Spain. The successful 
petition was submitted by Manuel Mart&iacute;n in 1834 after Mexico had won 
independence. Using the surname Mart&iacute;nez, Mart&iacute;n filed on behalf 
of himself and 10 children he said wished to accompany him. Mart&iacute;nez 
claimed he lacked sufficient agricultural land to bequeath his children. He 
requested that access to the grant's pastures, roads, and watering places be 
limited to the grantees. This was an attempt on his part to acquire a private 
rather than a community grant.</p> 
<p>When the Committee of the Territorial Deputation consulted with the Abiquiu 
town council concerning the Mart&iacute;nez petition, the council stated that 
the lands of Tierra Amarilla were of excellent quality and could support 500 
families.</p> 
<p>The council urged rejection of Mart&iacute;nez' request for limited access, 
recommending that roads, pastures, and watering places be left open to all 
residents of the Abiquiu jurisdiction. The Territorial Deputation agreed with 
the town over Mart&iacute;nez's strenuous protests, leaving the pastures, roads 
and watering places &quot;free according to the customs prevailing in all 
settlements.&quot; The T.A. grant was to be a community grant.</p> 
<p>At the time of Mart&iacute;nez's petition, Abiquiu still dominated commerce 
in the Chama River Valley. An Anglo party enroute from Taos to Southern 
California in 1843 along the Old Spanish Trail passed through Abiquiu. They 
left the following report concerning their observations.</p> 
<p>&quot;We found these people living in a very primitive fashion, footloose 
and free, unencumbered with worldly goods and ready, at an hour's notice, to 
accompany us on our travels. I remember contracting with an able-bodied man, 
some forty years of age, agreeing to pay him all he asked, an advance of two 
dollars, and giving him, after reaching California, a hat, a shirt, and a pair 
of shoes; the negotiation, which was closed on the spot, occupied less time 
than it takes to write this paragraph.&quot;</p> 
<p>Abiquiu's importance as a trading center increased during the years of the 
Mexican Republic because Abiquiu was the eastern gateway of the Old Spanish 
Trail to California.</p> 
<p>One of the principal routes of that trail passed through what is now 
Archuleta County. The date when traders first traveled the entire route is 
uncertain, but by 1835, the trade route was well established.</p> 
<p>In that year, the son of an interpreter to the Utes, Manuel Gregorio 
Torres, of Abiquiu, offered a piece of land as security for payment for a 
captive Indian woman, promising full payment as soon as he returned from a trip 
to California.</p>

<p><b>Forecast: Old Man Winter headed this way </b></p> 
<p><b>By Tom Carosello</b></p> 
<p><b>Staff Writer</b></p> 
<p>Pagosa Country residents beware - Old Man Winter has been spotted, and he's 
heading this way.</p> 
<p>In fact, some believe him to be here already, as evidenced by the ghostly 
shroud that has draped the San Juan Mountains in a thickening layer of white 
over the past few days.</p> 
<p>Recent reports from Wolf Creek Ski Area offer further proof - telling of 
midway snow depths exceeding five inches. As of Monday, Wolf Creek's snow total 
for the month had reportedly surpassed the 11-inch mark.</p> 
<p>At lower elevations, intermittent rain has been the norm, but recent 
forecasts provided by the National Weather Service office in Grand Junction 
suggest areas closer to town may receive their first measurable snowfall of the 
season within the next few days.</p> 
<p>The latest reports indicate a wet and cold low-pressure system is expected 
to hover over the Four Corners region today and tomorrow, then begin to move 
east by Saturday afternoon.</p> 
<p>Gusty conditions are in the mix for southwest Colorado today and tomorrow 
as well, and winds are predicted to accelerate to at least 20 miles per hour by 
this afternoon.</p> 
<p>Highs today should top out in the 50s, evening lows are forecast in the 
20s. Rain and/or wet snow chances are listed at 70 percent.</p> 
<p>Friday calls for mostly-cloudy conditions, a 40-percent chance for showers, 
thunderstorms and wet snow, highs in the 40s and lows in the 15-25 range.</p> 
<p>Similar forecasts for Saturday through Tuesday predict fewer clouds, a 
20-percent chance for scattered rain or snow showers, highs in the 50s and lows 
around 20.</p> 
<p>A 30-percent chance for rain at lower elevations and snow in the mountains 
is in the forecast for Wednesday, as are highs in the 50s and lows in the upper 
20s. </p> 
<p>The average high temperature recorded last week in Pagosa Springs was 57 
degrees. The average low was 32. Moisture totals for the week amounted to just 
under .30 inches. Total rainfall for this month stands at 2.49 inches.</p> 
<p>The Pagosa Ranger District rates the area fire danger as &quot;low.&quot; 
</p> 
<p>For updates on current fire danger and federal fire restrictions, call the 
Pagosa Ranger District office at 264-2268.</p> 
<p>The U.S. Department of Agriculture describes regional drought conditions as 
&quot;moderate.&quot;</p> 
<p>San Juan River flow through town ranged from a low of about 140 cubic feet 
per second to a high of approximately 240 cubic feet per second last week.</p> 
<p>The river's historic median flow for the week of Oct. 21 is roughly 70 
cubic feet per second.</p>
