<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p> Campaign Success! Barn Roof is Up! </p> 
<p>Since September 11, life for most people has changed, especially those 
living in America. Instead of the comfortable feeling of security, fear has 
entered into the consciousness of many. Fear and the unexplainable question of, 
&quot;How can this happen?&quot; The traditional diet of Americans is steak 
(cow) and potatoes. In this issue read about the connection between 
slaughtering animals and war.</p> 
<p>The barn roof at Vrajapura Farm has been completed to provide shelter for 
the cows this winter. This is all due to the contributions of ISCOWP members 
who are knowledgeable about the value of cow protection. Thank you so much!</p> 
<p>Cow Protection is not just a sentiment. To provide cow protection 
efficiently and properly involves knowledge and training. Each newsletter issue 
provides information to broaden the reader's knowledge of cow protection.</p>

</p> 
<p> I had the amazing experience yesterday of walking past a plaque listing 
American Civil War soldiers on my way to lunch and meeting a man who asked for 
directions. who turned out to be Pete White, (Maurice E. White), who teaches 
veterinary science at Cornell University, which is considered to have one of 
the best Agriculture Schools in the country. (Kamala dasi, who took care of 
cows on many ISKCON farms went to school there.)</p> 
<p>Anyway, he told me about an online veterinary diagnostic site which he had 
set up. It is highly technical, but it may be able to give devotees practical 
information on what is the problem with their cow or bull. Please check it out.

<p> You may also be interested in some of the other links from the veterinary 
school:</p> 
<p> http://www.vet.cornell.edu/main/ </p> 
<p>Pete White was also interested in the Amish and quite interested to hear 
about old cows and oxen on Hare Krsna farms. So it was quite an exchange of 
information.</p>

<p> Dear Balabhadra Prabhu, <br>
 I was very interested to see and hear about 
the ox speed grass mower. Do they still make them. Do you have any e mail 
addresses of anybody who has some for sale, especially if they don't mind 
exporting them.<br>
 ys syamasundara dasa</p> 
<p> Dear Syamasundara Prabhu, <br>
 As far as I know they are not made 
anymore. There is a father and son about 1 hour from Gita-nagari who 
reconditions them for a living. I don't know if they would export to England. 
I'll call them and find out. The mower in question is a McCormick-Deering # 9 
High Gear. The last I checked (several years ago) they were asking $650 US for 
a completely reconditioned mower with metal or rubber tires (your choice).</p> 
<p> Have you tried to research mower makers in your part of the world. There 
is a book titled &quot;Tools for Agriculture&quot; put out by Intermediate 
Technology publications. They are the publishing arm of International 
Technology Development Group which is based at 103/105 Southampton Row, London 
WC1B 4HH, UK ISBN# 1 85339 100 X</p> 
<p> When I was in Belarus the devotees had a mower that was made in Poland. 
Maybe you can contact the farm in Poland to see if they have contacts.</p> 
<p> You may also want to place a letter of inquiry in Small Farmer's Journal 
for contacts in your part of the world. The magazine is a wealth of information 
and well worth the subscription. Their address is:<br>

<b>Neck 
Yoke Design and Fit.1992</b> -- by Richard Roosenberg <br>
 This paper gives 
more detail on how the humble neck yoke works than any source we know. It 
analyzes the importance of the draft (or drop of the hitch point below the neck 
seats) and describes the consequences of the draft on bow movement and beam 
seating on the neck. The depth of draft has varying consequences depending on 
the nature of the load. Understanding this helps readers appreciate different 
yoke styles and their best uses. Yoke dimensions common to American neck yokes 
are described relative to the bow widths. This paper includes concepts 
essential for improving yokes along with a bibliography of traditional yoke 
knowledge.</p>

<p> <b>Building an Ox Yoke</b> -- by David Kramer, 1998 <br>
 This is a 
thorough how-to guide to making an ox yoke. You will find instructions on 
selecting and curing wood, shaping the beam of the yoke, making the bows, 
forging the hardware and assembling the final product. This TechGuide offers 
good background information for using the plans and templates.</p>

<p> <b>Yoke Maker's Plan and Template Package </b> <br>
 For those who want to 
make a series of yokes for growing teams, we suggest a special package of 2 
TechGuides (Neck Yoke Design and Fit and Building an Ox Yoke), a 4&quot; full 
sized plan, and a series of templates for beams with bow widths from 4 to 11 
inches. For the package we can discount these aids that would cost $36.50 
separately.<br>

</p> 
<p><b>Yoke Plans, Traditional American </b> -- by Richard Roosenberg <br>
 
These actual sized plans can aid you in making your own yokes. They include 
front and top views and along with several cross sections. They also show bow 
shapes for oval bows as well as half round bows should your animals need ovals. 
The development of these plans is described in the Neck Yoke Design &amp; Fit 
TechGuide (item #2gnyk). Their relative dimensions are based on bow widths and 
can be extrapolated to larger layouts without buying a complete set of plans. 
Indeed, we have discontinued sizes larger than 8&quot; due to high costs of 
reproducing copies over 48 inches long.</p>

<p> <b>Yoke Templates, Traditional American</b> -- by Richard Roosenberg <br>
 
These actual-size templates of the front and top outlines guide the shaping of 
a good yoke. The larger sizes come in reversible half templates with reference 
marks to orient the flipside to a straight reference chalk line. These are an 
economical alternative to larger yoke plans.</p>

<br> A gift from the gods: bottled cow's urine <br>
 By Julian West in New Delhi
<br> (Filed: 02/09/2001) <br>
<br>
 HINDU nationalists in India have launched a 
marketing exercise to promote cow's urine as a health cure for ailments ranging 
from liver disease to obesity and even cancer.<br>
<br>
 The urine, which is 
being sold under the label &quot;Gift of the Cow&quot;, is being 
enthusiastically promoted by the government of Gujarat, one of three states in 
India dominated by Hindu nationalists.<br>
<br>
 The urine is collected daily 
from almost 600 shelters for rescued and wounded cattle set up by the Vishwa 
Hindu Parisad (VHP), or World Council of Holy men, as part of a government 
cow-protection program to save the country's sacred, but often maltreated, 
beasts.<br>
<br>
 Advertised as being &quot;sterilized and completely 
fresh&quot; it is available for 20 rupees (30p) a bottle at about 50 centers 
run by the VHP in Gujarat, from 200 of their outlets in neighboring Madhya 
Pradesh, and at fairs and religious festivals throughout India.<br>
<br>
 It 
also comes in tablets or a cream mixed with other traditional medicinal herbs. 
Demand is currently outstripping supply.<br>
<br>
 Dr Jadi Patel at the VHP's 
headquarters in Ahmedabad said: &quot;It's very popular because the results are 
very good, but we've got a shortage.&quot; He explained that the cow protection 
centers had been formed after the last grand gathering of sadhus, or holy men, 
to save cows from &quot;unofficial slaughter by Muslims&quot;.<br>
<br>
 
Killing cows is illegal in most Indian states but there are an estimated 32,000 
illegal abattoirs and 13.7 million cows are believed to be slaughtered by 
Muslims for the leather industry. Animal rights activists in India also claim 
that the doe-eyed, hump-backed white Brahma cattle that are to be found on 
almost every Indian street are subjected to various abuses, including forced 
pregnancies to produce more milk.<br>
<br>
 The cow protection commission was 
set up to protect the holy cows, and research conducted by doctors involved in 
the project revealed that the cows' urine had medicinal properties.<br>
<br>
 
The idea of using it came from the central Indian headquarters of the Rashtriya 
Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), the powerful Hindu nationalist ideologues behind the 
country's Bharata Janata Party (BJP), where five scientists are researching its 
beneficial effects.<br>
<br>
 Like all devout Hindus, RSS members believe that 
all cow products are sacred. ghee, or clarified butter, is used in Indian 
cooking and to light lamps during temple ceremonies, and milk is commonly 
poured over sacred idols as an offering. The healing properties of cow dung and 
cow's urine are also mentioned in ancient Hindu texts. The research conducted 
by doctors at the cow-protection commission indicates that the urine can cure 
anything from skin diseases, kidney and liver ailments to obesity and heart 
ailments.<br>
<br>
 Although most Indian doctors view the medicines as 
eccentric, several advocates of the treatment have come forward in Gujarat, to 
support the doctors' claims.<br>
<br>
 They include Vidhyaben Mehta, a 
65-year-old woman with a cancerous tumor on her chest who has been taking cow's 
urine for the past three years. She says she is no longer in pain and has 
survived in spite of medical predictions that she would die two years ago.<br>

<br> So enthusiastic is the Gujarat government about its cows' urine medicines 
that it has asked the Indian Institute of Management to compile a database of 
traditional cures and verify the Hindu nationalists' findings.<br>
<br>
 The 
academics have also discovered that cow's urine is an extremely effective 
pesticide and plant fertilizer and are now developing for human consumption new 
drugs that contain the &quot;gift of the cow&quot;.<br>
<br>
 Prof Anil Gupta 
at the institute said: &quot;This isn't just a religious thing. If it's useful 
we shouldn't stop it simply because we think it has religious connections.&quot;

<p><b>Anecdote of Argentine Rural Life During Economic Collapse</b></p>

 Subject: Anecdote of Argentine rural life during 
economic collapse<br>
 Date: Friday, September 21, 2001 8:59 AM </p> 
<p> I thought I'd like to share with you all an anecdote of rural life in 
Tucuman, Argentina during what can only be called an economic collapse. This 
could well be relevant to many 1st world devotees as Argentina itself was the 
6th richest country in the world only 80 years ago. Such economic misery that 
the Great Depression brought about may not be too far away. As devotees know on 
this conference, I am not a scare monger for &quot;end of the world, run to the 
hills&quot;, but when facts are facts one must respond. Whilst many of the 
details may seem to be &quot;the worst of karmis&quot;, much can be learnt from 
there life.<br>
<br>
 In the center of Argentina is found a small state called 
Tucuman. This, and the surrounding states, have temperatures of up to 50 C (110 
F) in the summer, and in the winter it will rise to between 20-30 C (70-90 F) 
in the day and 0-10 C (30-50 F). Whilst the land is arid bush, there is ample 
rain in the summer and a wide range of crops can be grown all year round. It 
lies at the end of the great Argentine pampas, over 3000 km of flat land, going 
from humid to arid zones. Then the foothills and mountains of the Andes 
cordilleras spring up.<br>
<br>
 In the rural outback live people very simply, 
devout, superstitious, traditional and simple. Whilst there a man came from 
Tucuman city to sell cleaning solutions. His face was pure anxiety. In contrast 
to the faces of the locals there was no comparison. The locals, due to bad 
education, had poor teeth, poor health and looked rough and ready, but they had 
a simplicity of contentment that knew no bounds. The city man had nothing but 
tales of economic hardship, no jobs, no money, how it was impossible to pay the 
bills and to raise his children - to eat, to have shelter for married life 
whilst protecting ones interests.<br>
<br>
 Very few people go hungry in 
Argentina, why should they it is a country a little smaller than the US with 
less than 40 million people, where as the US has almost 300 million. The land 
is rich and fertile, cows are everywhere and nourish the bodies of the locals 
(we may disagree, but that is how it is). For people looking to emigrate from 
the US, EU and other danger spots, Latin America is a very good bet, mostly if 
you are in rural areas. The air system in the northern hemisphere mix little 
with that from the south, so any nuclear or biological warfare would leave the 
south more in safety. As with Australia, the population density is very low, 
but there is a wider distribution in Argentina than many places - it used to be 
developed, and has always profited from developed-world wars.<br>
<br>
 The 
moral of the story here is that the rural people were entirely immune from the 
economic chaos engulfing the country. They owned on average 10 hectares of 
land, most of it bush, they went about the land on &quot;sirkos&quot;, one 
horse carriages, or on bareback on horses. They were connected to electricity 
and television and mobile phones, but were quite aware that they could do with 
out them, they did before, they could again. It was not too long ago. Heating 
was from a wood stove and social life was round a campfire with a guitar, 
dancing and home made brews. Food was animal (cow, chicken or pig) with home 
grown corn inter-cropped with pumpkins. Pest control was via &quot;cura 
palabra&quot;, known to us as witchcraft - taking the insect and hexing it, 
which would then remove all the insects from the area. So with just the above 
ingredients their food needs were met. Water was from a well that each 
household had.<br>
<br>
 This may all seem very familiar to many in the US or 
in other former colonies. That is why it is relevant to us, more so than India, 
because at the end of the day no matter how much we absorb other cultures we 
still harbinger the simple things that we grew up with. And at the end of the 
day, it may well be much more difficult for &quot;whities&quot; to live in 
other cultures in Asia or Arabia, or Africa; just as the corollary may be true.
<br> <br>
 Another major factor is that people are used to working hard for 
little recompense, they know how to work the land, how to build simple shelter 
and contraptions to aid in farming. They may not have a diverse farming system 
suitable for the lacto-vegetarian diet, but many stepping stones are there to 
aid. Such may not be easily found now in more developed countries where farmers 
are subsidy-agrochemical-mechanization junkies and whilst rural life may be 
simple compared to LA or New York, it is extremely complex compared to 3rd 
world rural life.<br>
<br>
 Quite a few issues are raised here, and I hope you 
enjoyed the anecdote and the lessons that we can learn from it. I have others 
too, similar but different that I may share if wanted.<br>

<br>
 In the centennial year I traveled to a 
number of villages in a Gandhi project to the east of Puna in Maharastra I saw 
much the same, these villages were having difficulty with nutrition and the 
wealthy people of the big cities was funding medical and improvements 
introduced into the villages. This improvements consisted of expanding the 
income base of each individual household. The initial activities where a change 
of milk source from goats to cows (the local cows were for draft only, Kilnar) 
the cows introduced were from a variety of breeds from neighboring areas but 
were an improvement in milk production. Each family was given a cow and a bull 
was introduced from one of the other breeds to improve the milk production of 
the local Kilnar breed, the headman was the person in charge of the bull. They 
were also introducing mulberry trees and silk worms and various other cottage 
type industries to broaden the income base of the village.<br>
</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>I'd like to share some of my experiences for what ever it may be worth. I 
was travelling in areas quite far from any cities. These people were really 
quite isolated. None had ever seen a westerner. I only saw obvious instances of 
nutritional problems and diseases in villages closer to the cities where 
various influences had compelled the villagers to deviate from the traditional 
system. For example, I sometimes saw villages in which goats or chickens were 
kept. These villagers looked terrible, physically. Mostly, I saw clean simple 
villages full of healthy, well-fed, bright-faced, smiling people who were 
clearly not under any kind of pressure and had no problem to break from their 
routine for a spiritual program at any time of the day.<br>
<br>
 These 
villages definitely depended on cows and oxen for everything. The homes and 
compound walls were all made of cow dung. All cooking was done with cow dung. 
All tilling was done with oxen. All transportation was done with oxen. 
Threshing of grains was done by oxen. Irrigation was done with oxen. Crops were 
all fertilized only with cow dung.<br>
<br>
 Fruit trees of all types grew all 
around the homes providing cool shade and abundant fruit. The yield of just one 
of these trees far exceeded the ability of even the largest family to consume, 
so lots of fruit went to market, and EVERY family had money, but not much need 
to spend. Every bit of available land was cultivated and covered with lush, 
green crops. Even steep slopes were covered with terraces and ingenious, 
earthen irrigation systems. Wells full of fresh water were everywhere unless 
there was a river, lake or pond nearby. It seems that almost anywhere you go, 
you can dig down 10 to 15 feet and hit water. Even in the most remote 
countryside, there were always wells situated at short intervals along all the 
roads. While travelling at ox-speed, we would encounter a village at a rate of 
two or three per day; roughly three or four hours apart.<br>
<br>
 When I 
arrived in a village, the villagers would all pour out of their homes and come 
running out of the fields to great us. They would make offerings of all kinds 
to us and our Gaura-Nitai deities. Everyone would chant with us and EVERY 
SINGLE family would buy a small book for one rupee. I used to go door to door 
with a basket in which there was a framed picture of Gopal Krsna. Every 
householder would fill my basket with all kinds of grains. If I came in the 
morning or evening, they would all supply fresh milk.(at those times I would 
bring a pot) In village market places, all the vendors would load me up with 
fresh produce of all kinds. The head of the village would always come out to 
receive us and make all kinds of arrangements for our comfort. Our oxen were 
all fed and watered sumptuously and their carts loaded with enough hay to feed 
them for several days. All the prominent men of the village would beg us to 
take meals at their home where we were also fed sumptuously. We always had so 
much produce donated that we would prepare feasts enough to feed the entire 
village and still have weeks worth of produce remaining. When we encountered 
temples, we would donate the excess produce to the deities there. In no case 
did we ever actually ask for anything. Most of the time I did not even have to 
use the basket. People just approached us with offerings. Our carts were loaded 
mostly with books. We also carried Gaura-Nitai and their paraphernalia., pots 
and utensils for cooking and straw mats for sitting and sleeping on and that's 
about it apart from the one set of clothing on our backs. It was great! 
Although we had practically nothing, we were never in need of anything at any 
time.<br>
<br>
 These people were not poor. They had all their necessities in 
abundance. They were well and cleanly dressed. They had plenty of food and were 
all well fed. They were not like the emaciated refugees we often see in the 
cities. They were healthy, happy and relaxed. I never saw anyone work up a 
sweat. No one was ever in a hurry. No one ever appeared to be in any kind of 
anxiety. In the morning they would enjoy a big and leisurely breakfast and 
after casually cleaning up they would shuffle off to work a rice paddy or what 
ever. They would work around their homes and in their fields in the morning 
till the heat of the day set in and then by late morning work stopped till 
afternoon when it got cooler out. When the sun set, the entire village went to 
sleep, but they were up very early. There was always lots of time for their 
puja several times a day and never a reason to neglect it. As far as I could 
see, the men were generally not putting in more than six hours a day and these 
were very leisurely hours. The women were busy most of the day, but also at a 
very relaxed pace. Additionally, the field work did not go on all year around, 
but only during the growing season which came after the rains and lasted maybe 
three to five months. In some cases the season would be stretched by 
irrigation, but mostly irrigating was done only for growing rice. Even during 
the growing season, people are busy when it's time to plant and busy when it's 
time to harvest and do very little in the fields the rest of the time. They 
don't seem to have much a problem with weeds. Hardly any come up after the oxen 
have tilled. They don't use any obvious means of pest control. They plant 
enough to feed the bugs and other critters and still have enough for themselves.
<br> <br>
 These people's minds were not disturbed by unnecessary desires 
imposed on them by outside contact. They were very content in their simple 
village life and they were EXTRAORDINARILY God conscious. They were living in 
such a way that they were always aware of their complete dependence on God for 
everything and God supplied all their needs through the agency of the land and 
the cows. To protect the cows, the land and to satisfy God by their service was 
therefore the prime necessity.</p> 
<p>A westerner might go stir crazy in such an environment. Some of us have 
become addicted to all kinds of incessant sensory stimuli. But many would find 
this setting peaceful, beautiful, and extremely pleasing. Even these villagers 
are not content simply to watch their rice grow. They have lots of festivals, 
celebrations and social gatherings and these are all done in a big, colorful 
way with lots of food, music, dance, etc. At these times, everyone is happy to 
share their opulence.<br>
<br>
 I thought these remembrances might be 
interesting for those who have no experience of this. I'm not necessarily 
trying to make a point here, but if I was, it would be that the simple life 
style Srila Prabhupada describes is not a theory, but a system which has been 
in practice for millennia and is still working nicely today for millions of 
people. Srila Prabhupada was not introducing something new and unproven. Of 
course, different parts of the world present challenges not found in India.</p>

<h3>ISCOWP UPDATE</h3> 
<p><b>Garden</b><br>
 We canned over 500 jars of produce for winter storage 
and gifts for our members. Tomato puree, tomato sauce, tomato chunks, tomato 
chutney, tomato soup, salsa, beans, bean subj, chard subj, zucchini subj, 
squash subj, applesauce, and apple chunks are the different types of produce we 
canned. We dried boxes full of sandwich bags of tomatoes, squash, zucchini, and 
lavender. Tomatoes were are largest amount of dried produce. We have stored in 
several bushel baskets potatoes, squash and sweet potatoes. All this produce is 
stored in our root cellar which is part of our house.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p> Balabhadra cutting vegetables from the garden to be canned. </p> 
<p>Just up until a few weeks ago we were still getting produce from the 
garden. Kale and brussels sprouts were still providing tasty meals. The deer 
population this year is very large and at this time of year they are very 
hungry. They ate every thing a few days ago.</p> 
<p>Next year we want to plant berry bushes to make jams, more lavender for 
sachets and other products, and more herbs for medicinal products. Also more 
eggplant, potatoes, and sweet potatoes since these crops grew well and their 
taste was so superb.</p> 
<p>In preparation for next years garden we have taken much manure from the 
barn area and placed in the garden. This is a first year garden and we did not 
put any manure in it before we planted. Balabhadra wanted to see how it would 
do without it and where the weak soil areas might be .</p> 
<p><b>Additional Teamsters</b><br>
 Gauranga Prema das is here from South 
Africa to learn the principles of Vaisnava farming. Balabhadra is teaching him 
how to utilize the oxen to collect firewood for the winter fires. The 
additional 28 acres that we acquired this year has proven to be good training 
grounds for logging with oxen. Logging by oxen requires ability and once it is 
mastered, a good foundation for other activities with the oxen is acquired.<br>

<br> Gauranga Prema exchanges his training for labor on the farm. Another 
brahmacari, Bhakta Eli, comes with him 3 days a week to do the same. This 
arrangement is proving helpful in completing many farm chores.<br>
</p> 
<p><b>Barn Roof</b><br>
 We are very pleased with how the barn is developing. 
As you know, last year we collected money to cement the barnyard since the cows 
were in deep mud. In the process of cementing, poles were installed in the 
cement with the hope they would support a roof the following year if we could 
collect enough money. This year we collected for the roof and were able to put 
a 27 gauge green tin roof up and connect it to the old barn roof. The cement 
floor in the old barn connects to the new barn floor. Now the cows have full 
covered access to both barns. Under roof, 185 feet long by 60 feet wide is now 
the size of the combined barns. The cows have access to a thirty foot width for 
eating and lounging, and the other 30 feet is for storing hay and equipment.</p>
<p> Frank Guzeck, a local resident, has been the carpenter working on the barn 
and it was his idea to connect the roofs. He has done a very creative and 
innovative job on the outside as well as the inside of the barn. The land is 
mostly hilly here, so when constructing it is more of a challenge than when the 
ground is flat. The barn has the character of an old barn but with all new 
materials.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Mike securing nailers for the new tin roof on the barn</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Frank, Butchy, and Mike screwing new green tin roof on the new barn. Great 
crew.</p> 
<p> When we first bought the property and we lived a few miles away, we took 
part of the old barn roof that had fallen due to a storm and built a shed for 
our young oxen where we were living at the time. We had to take that shed down 
and now the same materials have been put back in place to once again complete 
the original old barn roof. Frank also straightened the poles on the old barn 
to give a more symmetrical look.</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p> </p> 
<p> North facing side of the barn has 2 hanger sliding doors. We found a very 
good deal on Hickory boards and used them as siding on 3 sides of the barn. 
Hickory is a very hard wood and also has a pretty grain pattern.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p> Looking down the inside length of the new barn. </p> 
<p> </p> 
<p> The west side of the new barn has 2 large doors that open in the middle, 
one door on the feed isle and one door on the area where the cows are. This 
arrangement allows also for equipment to clean out the barn. The open part on 
the lower west side of the barn is where the cement cow path will start and 
provide the cows a walkway out to the pasture without making a mud lane.</p> 
</blockquote> 
<p> On the whole the farm is shaping up and looking more presentable. We hope 
by next winter we will have the old barn painted, our house fully painted, the 
other two residences painted, a cow path installed to the barn, the new barn 
completed, and an equipment shed for all the ox drawn machines that are rusting 
in the weather. Once this initial &quot;set up&quot; stage is over we hope to 
get more into training, using the farm as a center for preaching, and 
developing income from farm based products.</p> 
<p> We are eternally grateful to all our members who have donated to the 
construction of this barn with the purpose of giving comfort to the cows. In 
our financial report we will give thanks and recognition to all donors.</p>

<h3> GITA-NAGARI OX POWER UNIT</h3> 
<p>A manual by Paramananda das &amp; Vaisnava das <br>
 Now available through 
the courtesy of Hare Krsna dasi</p> 
<p>This unit was built in 1985 as a project of Gita- nagari's Adopt- A- Cow 
program, to demonstrate the value of working oxen using improved alternative 
technology. For about five or six years, the oxen provided all the heating 
requirements for 60 residents of the farm. Residents selectively cut trees on 
the hillsides, and oxen pulled them down to the ox power unit, where they were 
sawed to the wood-stove specifications for the temple and various homes. The 
oxen then delivered the cord wood to each location around the community. In the 
early 1990's the use of the unit was abandoned as Gita- nagari shifted its 
focus away from self- sufficiency. But the unit, well- sheltered, can still be 
inspected at Gita- nagari where the community welcomes interested visitors.</p> 
<p> If you would like to have this manual please contact us (see page 2). The 
manual is well illustrated by Sarva Siddhi Ratha das. Excerpts from the 
manual's introduction follow to give you an idea of its content.<br>
</p> 
<p>&quot;In this article we will describe how we built an ox-driven, 
sweep-powered generator. The concepts behind the design and operation of this 
unit are not new or complicated. Throughout history all over the world, man has 
used the same principles to produce power from draft animals. Traditionally, 
the mechanisms used to produce power have been made of wood, but we have 
constructed our generator from metal components, with the objective of 
maximizing the strength and efficiency of the unit. Five oxen pull the tongues 
which a circular motion. Then, the motion is geared up, and the direction of 
the rotation is changed so that we end up with a shaft spinning at 765 rpm that 
will provide 60 horse-power. By using various types of pulleys off the final 
shaft, any range of speed can be achieved to drive any type of equipment 
desired.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p> Comprehensive view of pulley arrangement, showing placement in relation to 
mastersprocket tongues and oxen.</p> 
<p> To construct a machine similar to ours, you must have access to certain 
raw materials and the facility to convert them for usage. The sizes and 
strength of the components used in this unit have been carefully engineered and 
coordi-nated, so that any reduction of the given specifications will 
undoubtedly result in failure. In our case, many of the parts we used were not 
new, but we made it a point to be sure that used components were of good 
quality. Precision is essential. At one point, we ran into a lot of trouble 
with a used 2 3/16&quot; shaft that was 4' long, but 1/10000&quot; out of round.
<br> </p> 
<p>Much of the work involved can be done with basic metal working tools, but 
there is also a lot of work that must be done by skilled machinist. We did most 
of the work ourselves with an oxy-acetylene torch, electric arc-welder, drill 
press, and similar tools. In addition you must have access to a metal lathe. We 
were lucky to have a neighbor who does this work as a second job, so we avoided 
paying the inflated prices of a specialty metal-working machine shop. What 
follows is a section-by-section description of how the unit is 
constructed.&quot;</p> 
<p> &quot;Thus, as the oxen are pulling on their individual small cables, the 
pull is transferred to the large cable, and it is immediately taken up by the 
others. We underestimated the importance of these eveners at first. However, 
after a few weeks of running our power unit, we noticed that the oxen had to 
walk a little to far forward to get a good pull. So we shortened the larger 
cable by about 18&quot; around. Thus, each of the smaller cables got pulled by 
a little. The result was astounding: our oxen were able to pull much more 
easily and much harder with half the attention by the driver. After this, one 
driver was more than able to handle the whole unit single-handedly.&quot;</p>

<h3>WHY SEPTEMBER 11? Animal Slaughter = War</h3> 
<p><i>Some of our members have called to get our understanding of the 
September 11 tragedy. The following<br>
 quotes connect animal slaughter , 
specifically cow slaughter, to war and tragedy. In reality, cow protection<br>
 
is at the forefront of preventing such incidences . The quotes are from talks 
and purports of Vedic<br>
 scriptures by His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta 
Prabhupada, Founder Acharya of the International<br>
 Society for Krsna 
Consciousness, and various religions and authors/philosophers.</i><br>
<br>
 
The Golden Rule, &quot;Do unto others as you would have others do onto 
you,&quot; Is one of the uniting principles in the world's major religious 
traditions. In Judaism, it is taught, &quot;What is hateful to you, do not to 
your fellowmen.&quot; (Talmud, Shabbat 31a) Christianity teaches, 
&quot;Whatever ye would that men should do to you, do you even so to 
them.&quot; (Matthew 7:12) The followers of Islam declare, &quot;No one of you 
is a believer until he desires for his brother that which he desires for 
himself.&quot; (Sunnah, Hadith) In Confucianism it is said, &quot;Surely it is 
the maxim of loving kindness: Do not unto others that which you would not have 
them do unto you.&quot; (Analects 15.23) Buddhism also teaches, &quot;Hurt not 
others in ways that you yourself would find hurtful.' (Udana-Varga 5.18) And 
finally, in the world's earliest religious scriptures, the Vedic literature, we 
find, &quot;This is the sum of duty: Do naught unto others which would cause 
you pain if done unto you.&quot;(Mahabharata 5.1517)<br>
<br>
 The world of 
science echoes the world's religions with its own equivalent of the Golden 
Rule. Newton's Third Law of Motion says that &quot;For every action, there is 
an equal and opposite reaction.&quot; While Newton's law applies only to 
material nature, the implications run deeper still, extending to the most 
subtle levels of existence. In the East, this is called the law of karma.<br>

<br> In a very fundamental sense, too, this law relates to our treatment of 
animals. The violence in society is at least in part the result of our 
merciless diet and abuse of the natural world around us. In karmic terms, 
violence begets violence. In dietary terms, you are what you eat.<br>
 Food for 
the Spirit, Steven Rosen<br>
<br>
 Not to hurt our humble brethren (the 
animals) is our first duty to them, but to stop there is not enough. We have a 
higher mission--to be of service to them whenever they require it... If you 
have men who will exclude any of God's creatures from the shelter of compassion 
and pity, you will have men who will deal likewise with their fellow men.<br>
 
--Saint Francis of Assisi (mystic and preacher)<br>
<br>
 Prabhupada: [...] But 
in the western country the cows are specially being killed. Now the reaction is 
war, crime, and they are now repentant. And they will have to repent more and 
more.<br>
 Jayatirtha: So the wars and the crime are a direct result of the cow 
slaughter.<br>
 Prabhupada: Oh, yes. Oh, yes. It is a wholesale reaction. All 
these crises are taking place.[...]<br>

 &quot;Until he extends the circle 
of compassion to all living things, man will not himself find peace.&quot;<br>
 
--Albert Schweitzer<br>
<br>
 In this age of Kali the propensity for mercy is 
almost nil. Consequently there is always fighting and wars between men and 
nations. Men do not understand that because they unrestrictedly kill so many 
animals, they also must be slaughtered like animals in big wars. This is very 
much evident in the Western countries. In the West, slaughterhouses are 
maintained without restriction, and therefore every fifth or tenth year there 
is a big war in which countless people are slaughtered even more cruelly than 
the animals.<br>
 SB 4.26.5 <br>
<br>
 To be nonviolent to human beings and to 
be a killer or enemy of the poor animals is Satan's philosophy. In this age 
there is enmity toward poor animals, and therefore the poor creatures are 
always anxious. The reaction of the poor animals is being forced on human 
society, and therefore there is always the strain of cold or hot war between 
men, individually, collectively or nationally.<br>
 &gt;&gt;&gt; Ref. VedaBase 
=&gt; SB 1.10.6<br>
<br>
 &quot;Until we have the courage to recognize cruelty 
for what it is--whether its victim is human or animal--we<br>
 cannot expect 
things to be much better in this world... We cannot have peace among men whose 
hearts<br>
 delight in killing any living creature. By every act that glorifies 
or even tolerates such moronic delight in<br>
 killing we set back the progress 
of humanity.&quot;<br>
 --Rachel Carson <br>
<br>
 We are the living graves of 
murdered beasts, slaughtered to satisfy our appetites. How can we hope in this 
world to attain the peace we say we are so anxious for?<br>

they will kill each other. Indeed, he who sows the seeds of murder and pain 
cannot reap joy and love.&quot;<br>

 We 
don't want to stop trade or the production of grains and vegetables and fruit. 
But we want to stop these killing houses. It is very, very sinful. That is why 
all over the world they have so many wars. Every ten or fifteen years there is 
a big war -- a wholesale slaughterhouse for humankind. But these rascals -- 
they do not see it, that by the law of karma, every action must have its 
reaction.<br>
<br>
 You are killing innocent cows and other animals -- nature 
will take revenge. Just wait. As soon as the time is right, nature will gather 
all these rascals and slaughter them. Finished. They'll fight amongst 
themselves -- Protestants and Catholics, Russia and America, this one and that 
one. It is going on. Why? That is nature's law. Tit for tat. &quot;You have 
killed. Now you kill yourselves.&quot;<br>
<br>
 They are sending animals to 
the slaughterhouse, and now they'll create their own slaughterhouse. [Imitating 
gunfire:] Tung! Tung! Kill! Kill! You see? Just take Belfast, for example. The 
Roman Catholics are killing the Protestants, and the Protestants are killing 
the Catholics. This is nature's law.<br>

<p>Slaughterhouse Civilization <br>
 As long as there are slaughterhouses,

better about ourselves and better about the animals, knowing we're not 
contributing to their pain.<br>
 --Paul and Linda McCartney </p>

<p>Kalki enjoying the warm fall weather at Vrajapura Farm</p> 
<p> Panca-gavya, the five products received from the cow, namely milk, yogurt, 
ghee, cow dung and cow urine, are required in all ritualistic ceremonies 
performed according to the Vedic directions. Cow urine and cow dung are 
uncontaminated, and since even the urine and dung of a cow are important, we 
can just imagine how important this animal is for human civilization. Therefore 
the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krsna, directly advocates go-raksya, the 
protection of cows. Civilized men who follow the system of varnasrama, 
especially those of the vaisya class, who engage in agriculture and trade, must 
give protection to the cows. Unfortunately, because people in Kali-yuga are 
mandah, all bad, and sumanda-matayah, misled by false conceptions of life, they 
are killing cows in the thousands. Therefore they are unfortunate in spiritual 
consciousness, and nature disturbs them in so many ways, especially through 
incurable diseases like cancer and through frequent wars and among nations. As 
long as human society continues to allow cows to be regularly killed in 
slaughterhouses, there cannot be any question of peace and prosperity.<br>
 
&gt;&gt; Ref. VedaBase =&gt; Srimad Bhagavatam 8.8.11<br>
<br>
 To kill cows 
means to end human civilization.<br>
 Srimad Bhagavatam 1.4.9 <br>
<br>
 The 
cow's calf not only is beautiful to look at, but also gives satisfaction to the 
cow, and so she delivers as much milk as possible. But in the Kali-yuga, the 
calves are separated from the cows as early as possible for purposes which may 
not be mentioned in these pages of Srimad Bhagavatam. The cow stands with tears 
in her eyes, the sudra milkman draws milk from the cow artificially, and when 
there is no milk the cow is sent to be slaughtered. These greatly sinful acts 
are responsible for all the troubles in present society.<br>
 Srimad Bhagavatam 
1.17.3<br>
<br>
 According to Manu, the great author of civic codes and 
religious principles, even the killer of an animal is to be considered a 
murderer because animal food is never meant for the civilized man, whose prime 
duty is to prepare himself for going back to Godhead.<br>
<br>
 He says that in 
the act of killing an animal, there is a regular conspiracy by the party of 
sinners, and all of them are liable to be punished as murderers exactly like a 
party of conspirators who kill a human being combinedly. He who gives 
permission, he who kills the animal, he who sells the slaughtered animal, he 
who cooks the animal, he who administers distribution of the foodstuff, and at 
last he who eats such cooked animal food are all murderers, and all of them are 
liable to be punished by the laws of nature.<br>

<h3>IMCA UPDATE</h3> 
<p> ISKCON Ministry for Cow Protection and Agriculture </p> 
<p> We have submitted 3 proposals for the ISKCON Governing Body Commission 
concerning cow protection for their March 2002 meetings. One proposal concerns 
a budget for the Ministry. At present there is no budget to cover the 
Ministry's services to ISKCON. The second one addresses last year's problems 
with the management of two cow protection centers in India, Mayapur and 
Vrndavan. Vrndavan has made progress in implementing steps for a solution, but 
Mayapur has not. Therefore this proposal addresses the urgency of finding 
solutions.</p> 
<p> One of the ways to support a cow protection program is to sell milk from 
the cows. If this becomes the prominent means then there is danger in falling 
into the commercial dairy pitfalls. The only way a commercial dairy makes a 
profit is to cull (kill) its unproductive animals. It is imperative that such 
programs find other prominent means of income. Cow urine and dung are also a 
means of income and can become the prominent ones. Please read the following 
correspondence.</p> 
<p> From: Nirguna To: ISCOWP (Balabhadra Dasa &amp; Chaya Dasi - USA) <br>
 
Subject: News from Lavanga. Date: Tuesday, July 31, 2001 2:30 AM</p> 
<p> Hari Bol Chayadevi Prabhu, All glories to Srila Prabhupada, Following is 
the text of a letter from Lavanga Latika that I received yesterday: &quot;A 
friend of ours who is a research scientist in Agriculture and an independent 
consultant in organic agriculture and who was at the Daund ISKCON farm for a 
few months advising them, was just visiting and he told me how he was at the 
Rajasthan Goseva Sangh working with them for 10 years. At first by selling 
their milk and raw cow dung they could barely make ends meet, but last year 
following his plan they earned 32 lakhs from cow urine medicines and selling 
composted gobar in bags. They have their own clinic for cow urine medicines. He 
can really teach a lot of valuable things for cow protection. He says of 
primary importance is cow urine, then gobar, lastly milk as a side product.</p> 
<p> In Daund he said that they grew 13 acres of wheat only on cow urine spray 
and had a wonderful crop . Now somehow I have to get the figures of how many 
tons of wheat and times of spraying from Sanat Kumar who is in charge there. 
This is very important to know how to use cow urine. For growth just 5 % in 
water is used and for pest repellent 10%. We are starting cow urine medicine 
here with our devotee farmer who is just getting over malaria with a 
temperature of 105. So there is a lot of hope for the future in cow urine and 
dung. Never mind the milk.</p> 
<p> I got in touch with Sanat Kumar and they grew 6 tons of wheat with 10% 
urine sprayed weekly on the crop. Our friends name is Manohar Kahke , he is MSC 
but did not learn anything of value in college but by practical experience in 
organic farming.&quot;</p> 
<p> The third proposal concerns the recognition of a committee to formulate 
Vaisnava Rural Development Guidelines. We have been working on these guidelines 
with the help of the COM Cow conference members. Realizing that we can not 
finish the formulation by the GBC proposal deadline for this year we are 
slating its completion for next year's deadline.</p> 
<p> Like the standards, these guidelines can be used by any group interested 
in developing a community based on Vaisnava understanding and cow based 
agriculture. Some interesting excerpts from this proposal:</p> 
<p> PROPOSAL NAME: Rural Development Land Committee </p> 
<p> PRESENTATION OF PROPOSAL: </p> 
<p> Whereas: Most ISKCON farm communities are struggling to maintain their 
land, cows and devotee families, Whereas: There is no Vaisnava Rural 
Development Guideline to guide not only the maintenance but further development 
of ISKCON farms,</p> 
<p> Whereas: To reinvigorate ISKCON farm communities in accordance with the 
wishes of His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, the ISKCON 
Ministry of Cow Protection and Agriculture and an international ISKCON Rural 
Land Development Committee are currently formulating a Vaisnava Rural 
Development Guideline,</p> 
<p>Whereas: The guideline presents sustainable principles and practices of 
land use that encourage participation in lifetime-protected cow-based 
agriculture and provides tenure security for the participants,<br>
</p> 
<p>PRESENTATION OF RESOLUTION: <br>
 Resolved, That the GBC body approves the 
ISKCON Rural Development Committee be established to formulate the Vaisnava 
Rural Development Guideline for ISKCON rural land management.<br>
</p> 
<p>EXPLANATION: <br>
 Please give answers to the following questions: <br>
 2) 
Why this proposal is important for the success of ISKCON?<br>
</p> 
<p>Cow protection is a foundation principle to the establishment of a potent 
spiritual ISKCON. Without viable ISKCON farming communities cow protection can 
not become established.</p>

<h3>REALIZATIONS OF A TEAMSTER IN TRAINING</h3> 
<p> Bt Gauranga Prema das (in training at Vrajapura Farm)</p> 
<p>Have you seen the movie called &quot;City Slickers&quot;? If you have then 
you'll have a pretty good idea of what my first experiences were like here on 
the farm. Externally, I got my foot stepped on by a cow and nearly had a team 
of oxen trample right over me (thank God they're well trained and stopped by 
voice command). While internally I realized that this service requires a whole 
lot of patience, intelligence and love.</p> 
<p>I'm from South Africa and have been living in a Hare Krsna Temple for 5 
years now. For those of you who don't know what this monastic lifestyle 
involves, I did things like cooking, cleaning, teaching, organizing, and 
managing besides your daily religious practices. Of course there's much more, 
but something I never got to look at is how I was &quot;getting things 
done.&quot; When I started working the oxen, I got to see my behavior more 
closely.</p> 
<p>First lesson I learned was that a student would like to learn from someone 
that makes learning and working an enjoyable and exciting experience. No one 
likes to learn and work with someone who is grumpy and keeps yelling and 
hitting him or her. This reminded me of my accounting teacher I had in high 
school, old Mr. Hughes. He was infamous for giving students a hard time, 
yelling, and boring uninspiring lectures. But, guess what? I'm realizing that 
for most of my life I'd been dealing with people the same way that Mr. Hughes 
had. I'm seeing a whole side of me which I never had to deal with for so much 
of the day. Anger, all bottled up inside. For me I'm seeing that if something 
didn't go my way, I'd have to &quot;FORCE IT&quot;, just like old Mr. Hughes. 
Just like if I'm lifting something that's really heavy, my next attempt is 
usually out of anger, which could easily lead to injury. If something doesn't 
go my way, maybe resists a little, the natural thing to do (at least in my 
case) is administer some pressure or force, not intelligence. The question one 
could ask is, &quot;why is this door not opening?&quot; or &quot;why doesn't it 
work?&quot; And 9 out of 10 times there will be an answer.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p> Agni and Shyam waiting for a small load of firewood. </p> 
<p>While working with Agni and Shyam (ox team) I'm learning that when 
something doesn't go &quot;MY&quot; way then it's probably my fault. That is 
something that I've not considered before, however it is something the oxen are 
aware of. For instance, while hauling firewood from the forest there are so 
many obstacles. Sometimes the oxen see a ground hog hole in the ground which I 
haven't seen, and they go left instead of my instructions to go right. There 
are so many ways one can achieve the desired result with patience and 
intelligence. I need to remind myself that Agni and Shyam have been doing this 
longer than I have. They are in the mode of goodness and I'm not. So instead of 
doing the instinctive action of applying Force, I'm learning to stop to 
re-evaluate the situation and use my God given intelligence. I know this is not 
new to many of you, but to me, I've learned an important lesson. And this is 
something I'm now trying to apply in every situation. This anger comes from 
unsatisfied lust, which comes from contemplation of the senses; at least this 
is what the Bhagavad-Gita is teaching us. &quot;When one contemplates the 
object of the senses, attachment develops and from attachment lust. And when 
lust is unsatisfied anger which leads to loss of intelligence.&quot;</p> 
<p>Of course it did happen and it may happen again that I did thrash it out 
with the boys and yell out of anger not love. And when it did happen I lost 
intelligence and just wanted to &quot;make them&quot; go my way not trying to 
find out why they stopped. You know, I realize that I have to develop a good 
loving relationship with them because I have to deal with them tomorrow and the 
day after and after. So to get them to do what I want by force and no real love 
cannot last for a long time. This will spoil our relationship. This is just 
like our relationship with Krsna (the name of the Supreme Personality of 
Godhead). He doesn't put on a show about His real position or pretend or force 
us to do anything because He knows He has to deal with us eternally. He doesn't 
fake a caring, loving relationship like we do. If we meet someone for one day 
we can be very nice to that person, but if that person is not so nice towards 
us it's very difficult to maintain that pretense. But Krsna has to always deal 
with us. So He acts out of love. And I see that I need to come up to the level 
of loving the oxen, the cows, because they can sense pretence. Just like if 
someone just wants to be your friend so that he can enjoy your wealth and keeps 
telling you nice things, this is disturbing. So the oxen also are not happy 
when I'm just praising them and speaking nicely to them so that they'll do what 
I want them too. They can sense that I am not really caring for them.</p>

<p>When we first turn to God it's out of fear, then once we develop some 
knowledge, out of duty, but ultimately we have to approach Him out of Love. 
Similarly we need to follow the same formula with these animals that are 
situated in the mode of goodness. First we may hear about the karmic reactions 
for mistreating the cows and oxen and start making better arrangements for them 
out of fear. If we want to love the cows we'll naturally want to develop 
knowledge about them. What they like and dislike and in this way try to please 
them. Because they are animals in the mode of goodness, they know how to 
reciprocate with our attempts at loving them. But the problem is that most 
times I'm not in the mode of goodness. Now I've a lot of homework to do, and it 
starts with me.</p>
