<h3>Selecting Ornamental and Shade Trees for the Eastern Plains </h3> 
<p>Landscaping with Trees </p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>Proper landscaping elements can conserve up to 25% of the energy needed to 
heat or cool a home or building. Using trees, shrubs, vines and man-made 
structures can modify the climate around any building to reduce heat gains in 
the summer and heat losses in winter. Protection from winter wind and shading 
from summer sunlight can effectively reduce energy consumption.</p> 
<p>When landscaping a home, sketch it and the lot to scale, allowing 1/8 or 
1/10 inch per linear foot. Identify north (N) with an arrow. On the plan, mark 
driveways, downspouts, utilities, fences, walkways, overhead lines and 
obstructions, doors, windows and other glass areas. Measure the height of the 
house. Observe the wind and effects of a winter storm on your building. Note 
the direction of winter winds, usually Northwest in origin, and add windbreaks 
of mostly evergreen trees to your plan to block the prevailing wind. (See
Landscaping for Energy Conservation, no.7.225)</p> 
<p>Observe the sun during different seasons of the year. Notice how the sun 
strikes the house in the early morning and late afternoon in the summer, and 
between 9 a.m. and 3 p.m. in the winter. Add deciduous shade trees to your plan 
to maximize summer shading and winter solar heating. Avoid planting evergreens 
on the south and southwest sides of a home, since they will block winter solar 
heat. Instead, plant evergreens on the north and west sides of your property to 
slow the prevailing winter winds and save on heating bills.</p> 
<p> Choose specific trees for your plan with an understanding of their mature 
height and spread. The height of the structure you want to shade or protect 
should be considered. A single story building surrounded by medium to small 
trees appears aesthetically pleasing from a design perspective. Also, the 
mature height of trees will determine the location for maximum shading. Use 
small trees under utility lines and near small buildings. Remember that 
evergreens can provide screening from unsightly views and a sound barrier from 
traffic and loud noises, as well as wind protection. Keep in mind that large 
shade trees require large planting areas for the development of healthy root 
systems and a mature canopy. Avoid planting spreading trees too close to 
structures.</p> 
<p>Use fences, windbreak plantings, and shade trees to provide a sun pocket on 
the south side of your home, creating a warm spot for outside activities during 
sunny, cool, but comfortable winter days. A sun pocket makes an excellent 
location for a patio or greenhouse.<br>
</p> </blockquote>

<p>Site Selection </p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>Choose your planting site carefully. Match the tree's desired function to 
the cultural and environmental conditions of the site. These include: soil 
conditions and pH, available light and exposure, water and adequate drainage, 
localized weather patterns, terrain and elevation and the presence of a 
microclimate (a location with climatic conditions different from the 
surrounding geographic area). Choose trees that are well adapted to Colorado's 
harsh, variable climate. Consider that some trees are more suited to partial 
shade, low moisture and drought from sprinkler system malfunctions and other 
changes that occur as a landscape planting matures.</p> </blockquote> <br>

<p>Choosing a Tree </p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>Consider the normal mature height and spread of trees for your site. Trees 
with a slow rate of growth are generally thought to be more desirable. Fast 
growing trees develop weak wood that splits and breaks easily in storms, as in 
the snowstorm of September 1995. Consider the general shape of the tree at 
maturity since upright forms can be more appropriate for narrow spaces than 
spreading types.</p> 
<p>Some trees are evaluated for insect and disease resistance. Crabapples, for 
examples, should be chosen for fire blight resistance.</p> 
<p>Consider other plant characteristics that make trees desirable, such as 
flowers, fruit, fall color of leaves, winter texture in the landscape, 
exfoliating or colorful bark, branching habit, more than one season of 
ornamental interest and attractiveness to wildlife and birds.</p> 
<p> Some characteristics make trees undesirable. Avoid planting trees with 
weak wood unless used for quick, temporary cover only. If fast growing, 
weak-wooded trees are used, plan to replace them with more suitable species as 
soon as possible. Add man-made structures, like arbors, to provide immediate 
shade. Beware of trees that are susceptible to insects and diseases or that 
require high maintenance and frequent pruning. Do not locate trees with 
excessive leaf, fruit or twig drop next to gutters, sidewalks, patios or 
parking lots. Avoid weedy species that become difficult to control in 
Colorado's environmental and social conditions, since chemical herbicides are 
usually the only effective controls. Never TOP trees to limit growth or control 
their size. Topping trees &quot;causes decay and sprout production, resulting 
in a potentially hazardous situation once the sprouts become large and 
heavy&quot; according to the International Society of Arboriculture, the 
recognized authority on tree health care.</p> 
<p>When selecting the plant in the nursery, always choose the best, healthiest 
plant. Select a reputable Colorado nursery or garden center that stocks trees 
acclimated to our growing conditions. Nursery-grown plants are superior to 
&quot;collected&quot; plants of the same species, since containerized plants 
are the least risky of all, as compared to B&amp;B stock and bare-root 
material. Choose only trees with good branch spacing and trunk taper. Leaves, 
when present, should be evenly spaced along the twigs. Avoid trees with many 
upright branches, rather than good horizontal growth. Do not purchase trees 
that have injuries to the bark or with root balls that are loose in the 
container, or have not been kept moist. Avoid trees with circling roots that 
will eventually girdle the trunk. Avoid trees with visible damage from insects 
or diseases.</p> </blockquote> <br>
