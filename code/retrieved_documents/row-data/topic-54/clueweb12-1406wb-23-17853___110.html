<h2>Report #1: 1998 NESEA American Tour de Sol - Routes, Dates, &amp; 
Highlights</h2> 
<p> Folks, It's time to start planning to coming to the 1998 NESEA American 
Tour de Sol! Below is the current schedule, lifted from www.nesea.org .&nbsp;
</p> 
<p> As in the past, I will be acting as reporter and announcer.&nbsp; </p> 
<pre> Mike Bianchi </pre> 
<p> </p> 
<p> Dates: May 8-18, 1998 </p> 
<p> Location: New York City to Washington DC with events in: </p> 
<pre> New York Morristown, Princeton and Burlington County, NJ New Castle and 
Dover, DE Sandy Point State Park, MD Washington, DC.&nbsp;</pre> 
<p> </p> 
<p> HIGHLIGHTS OF THE 1998 NESEA TOUR </p> 
<p> SAE joins NESEA for a special NYC event: May 7-8 </p> 
<pre> The Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE), the most prestigious 
automotive engineering association in the world, is joining forces with NESEA 
on a two- day mini-conference May 7-8 called &quot;Making Hybrid Electric 
Vehicles Commercially Viable&quot;.&nbsp; The event, will attract engineers 
from around the world and be the opening event for the NESEA Tour.&nbsp; NESEA 
Tour vehicles and participants will arrive Friday, and offer tours of the 
vehicles to area students and rides to conference participants and fleet 
people.&nbsp;</pre> 
<p> Tech Testing and Starting Ceremonies in New York: May 9-10 </p> 
<pre> Saturday and Sunday will include technical testing and starting 
ceremonies in the heart of downtown Manhattan.&nbsp; The New York City 
Department of Transportation has taken the lead in New York, and they will work 
with us to assure that everything runs smoothly.&nbsp;</pre> 
<p> New Jersey Rolls out the Red Carpet: May 10-11 </p> 
<pre> The New Jersey Department of Transportation, the Department of 
Environmental Protection, the Board of Public Utilities, and several rideshare 
companies and friends will roll out the red carpet in Morristown, Princeton, 
and Burlington County Institute of Technology, New Jersey.&nbsp; We have found 
an amazingly rural route through this densely populated state that is probably 
second only to California in the number of commuter trips taken each day.&nbsp; 
New Jersey boasts Power Commute, an Electric Station Car Demonstration in three 
towns, a newly created Office of Sustainability which is attracting Green 
businesses to the state, and an active Clean Cities program.&nbsp; Furthermore, 
NJ Transit will soon acquire two Orion hybrid electric buses.&nbsp;</pre> 
<p> Delaware will host the Range event: May 12 </p> 
<pre> The NESEA Tour will visit Delaware for the first time this year.&nbsp; 
The Governor and all the state agencies are working with us to make our two 
stops in Delaware very special.&nbsp; After stopping in historic New Castle, we 
will follow the coastline to Dover, the beautiful capital of this state, and 
home of the Dover Downs, a Nascar sanctioned race track.&nbsp; Dover will be 
the location for range demonstration.&nbsp;</pre> 
<p> Maryland to host Autocross event: May 13 </p> 
<pre> We will return to Sandy Point State Park for an educational event for 
school children, an Autocross event, and acceleration testing.&nbsp; We will 
again be working with the Governor and all the state agencies on this 
event.&nbsp;</pre> 
<p> Washington DC and the Legislative Connection: May 14-15 </p> 
<pre> Washington will be the final celebration of the 10th annual NESEA Tour, 
and we have a unique opportunity to showcase vehicles and educate 
decisionmakers on how far electric vehicles have come in 10 short years! We are 
working with the U.S. Department of Energy, the Environmental Protection 
Agency, the Electric Transportation Coalition, Edison Electric Institute, 
Potomac Electric, Darby Associates and more to make our visit to the U.S. 
Capital as effective as possible.&nbsp; We plan to visit both the White House 
and legislators on Capitol Hill.&nbsp; We look forward to working with each 
team to assure that all of your representatives come to meet you, and learn 
about electric vehicles! The final awards ceremony will be held on Friday, May 
15 at a NESEA hosted brunch.&nbsp;</pre> 
<p> </p>

<h2>Report #2: s `Sungo' and `Hopper EV' return to the American Tour de Sol
</h2> 
<p> The 10th NESEA American Tour de Sol attracts entrants from colleges and 
individuals around the country.&nbsp; I spoke to Tom Hopper, a teacher and team 
advisor at New Hampshire Technical Institute's (NHTI) electric vehicle racing 
team.&nbsp; Tom will also be returning as an individual entrant.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> NHTI's `Sungo' will be coming back once again with some significant 
modifications.&nbsp; `Sungo' is a two-person commuter car made from a welded 
aluminum frame with a composite body that hinges up at the front to let the 
people get in and out.&nbsp; In 1997 it one a number of prizes, including 1st 
place in the Commuter Catagory.&nbsp; Not to rest on their laurels, the team 
plans several changes aimed at improving its range and drivability.&nbsp; Major 
changes include reworking the rear battery compartment to get better packing of 
the Ovonic nickel metal hydride batteries and adding 2 extra 12-Volt modules 
making the total string 144 Volts.&nbsp; They are also improving the battery 
cooling ventilation and adding better battery monitoring.&nbsp; They hope to 
extend the range to 150 miles-per-charge.&nbsp; Structural improvements are 
being made to the front end to make it more rugged.&nbsp; While they are at it, 
they are adding 3.5 inches to the wheel base and giving the aluminum frame a 
thorough inspection, particularly looking for cracks and weakness.&nbsp; The 
dual permanent magnet motors and toothed belt drives on the rear wheels have 
been swapped out for a new pair of AC induction motors that drive the rear 
wheels through fixed-ratio planetary gear boxes.&nbsp; They'll also improve the 
seating a bit, overall `Sungo' but looks very much the same.&nbsp; &quot;We 
expect `Sungo' to be tougher, quicker and with greater range, plus fail 
safe&quot;, Tom said.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> Tom was very happy how his personal project did in the 1997 NESEA 
Tour.&nbsp; It is a larger 2-person, aluminum frame and composite body car 
known as the `Hopper EV'.&nbsp; In the autocross, it's wide stance, front sway 
bar, and low-and-center battery pack gave it excellent handling through the 
twists and turns.&nbsp; And after the awards ceremony, Tom and his co-pilot 
drove the `Hopper EV' from Portland Maine to Concord New Hampshire, using the 
diesel-fueled generator trailer.&nbsp; Since then, Tom drives it every day 
commuting to work at NHTI.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> But, as in past years, Tom has a few changes in mind.&nbsp; `Hopper EV' 
will be entered again as a series hybrid, but this time without the generator 
trailer.&nbsp; Instead, a 90 cc engine burning 85% Methanol and 15% gasoline 
(M85) will attach directly to the car.&nbsp; Loosing the trailer will lower the 
tandem weight by 450 pounds, to about 1200 pounds curb weight.&nbsp; As before, 
the engine will be under the driver's control.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> The drive train, which was also using toothed belts, is being replaced 
with the same planetary gear box that is going into `Sungo', and it will be 
driven by one of the same AC induction motors as `Sungo' uses.&nbsp; &quot;The 
problem with belts is they will break in hard acceleration and they wear the 
small pulleys.&nbsp; We are very excited about the gear boxes.&quot;</p> 
<p> On top of that, the roof is going to be raised a bit to give more head 
room, a larger rear window is going to be installed, and some acoustic sound 
deading material will be added.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p> </p> 
<p> </p> 
<h2>Report #3: Early Reports on Teams Showing Up This Year</h2> 
<p> Now it is time, once again, for the annual Reports From the North East 
Sustainable Energy Association's &quot;American Tour de Sol Electric Vehicle 
Championship.&quot; Each year at this time we present the long distance, 
out-in- the-real-world EV sporting event from the East Coast of the United 
States.&nbsp; This is the 10th anniversary of the American Tour de Sol and it 
seems it will live up to laurels.&nbsp; I had the opportunity to speak with 
Nancy Hazard, Director of the ATdS, and Sheilah Pierce, the Event Coordinator, 
while they were in Morristown NJ planning the stop here on Sunday May 
10th.&nbsp; A more detailed route and plan of events will be posted later.&nbsp;
</p> 
<p> What I wanted to report today is some of the entrants and participants who 
have signed up.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> Perennial participant Solectria will be represented by three 
vehicles.&nbsp; The Connecticut Ride Share folks will return with one of their 
Solectria `Force' passenger cars, running on Electrosource Horizon advanced 
lead acid batteries.&nbsp; Another `Force' will have a pack of Ovonics Nickel 
Metal Hydride batteries.&nbsp; And we expect to see the new Solectria `CityVan' 
package delivery vehicle.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> The New York Power Authority is coming, entering a Honda `EV Plus' with 
its long-range nickel metal hydride battery pack.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> Toyota is participating in the NESEA Tour as a Silver Sponsor.&nbsp; While 
they will not be entering any vehicles in the competition, they are bringing 
two `RAV4- EV' sport utility vehicles for public display and ride-and-drive 
demonstrations, _and_ one of their `Prius' hybrid-electric cars that are being 
sold in Japan.&nbsp; The `Prius' will act as the Pace Car of the ATdS.&nbsp;</p>
<p> &quot;We have six or seven hybrids this year,&quot; Nancy said, 
&quot;including a car from the University of California at Davis, and 
Swarthmore College will be returning.&nbsp; Tom Hopper will again have the only 
hybrid that is a personal project.&quot;</p> 
<p> Among the new entrants will be a high school in Cinnaminson New 
Jersey.&nbsp; I have not seen the details yet, but I'd expect this team to get 
a lot of local press.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> A number of one-person vehicles are promising to be present.&nbsp; The 
`Charger Bike', which provides electric assistance _only_ while the rider 
pedals, will be ridden by a high school team.&nbsp; The team known as `Project 
e-', which for years has entered a pickup-truck which was at first purely 
electric and then hybrid-electric, says they will be entering a single-person 
vehicle.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> Some others of the entrants will be familiar names.&nbsp; Team New England 
will return with their `1959 Berkeley' sports car.&nbsp; And the `Sol Survivor 
IV', the slick Solar Commuter car from the high school in Peterborough New 
Hampshire is expected to be back.&nbsp; The team from Cato-Meridian High in 
Cato New York should make it also.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> NESEA says they also have a `Citicar' entered and at least one more 
bicycle.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> And finally, one of my favorite teams, the 4th-through-8th graders from 
the Riverside School in Lyndonville Vermont (not one of them legal to drive, 
yet) will be be there.&nbsp; Last year they claimed their `Helios the Heron', 
converted from a 1971 Volkswagon microbus ran on electricity, but I think there 
was a lot of psychic energy from 40 screaming kids pushing it down the 
road.&nbsp; Regardless, they have been one of the most popular teams with the 
young people who visit the many public displays given during the NESEA 
Tour.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> As in years passed, the American Tour de Sol will be a collection that 
will prepresent the art and science of electric vehicles, from the creations of 
hobbiests to the products of major corporations.&nbsp; If you want to see real 
electric vehicles, &quot;on the hoof&quot;, I know of no finer place.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p> </p> 
<h2>Report #4: Looking for Volunteers</h2> 
<p> The 1998 NESEA American Tour de Sol starts with two days of registration 
and inspection of the entrants.&nbsp; Friday and Saturday, May 8th and 9th, the 
teams will assemble in New York City to have their vehicles scrutinized.&nbsp; 
When the cars are not actively being inspected and tested, they will be on 
display.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> The inspection and testing serves two purposes.&nbsp; First it collects 
technical data, recording the weight, acceleration, braking and other 
performance and design information.&nbsp; Secondly, as this is an event that 
occurs entirely on public streets and highways, there is a great interest in 
the safety aspects of the vehicles' design and construction.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> Another major concern is electrical safety.&nbsp; Just as you would not 
want a fuel leak in a vehicle with an internal combustion engine (and they will 
be looking for those in the Hybrid Category entrants) you do not want an 
electrical leak.&nbsp; The NESEA Tour rules require less than 1 milliamp (mA) 
of current through a 10,000 Ohm resistor when measured between the chassis and 
the most-positive and most-negative poles of the fully-charged battery.&nbsp; 
That requirement comes from the fact that 5 mA through the human body can be 
lethal and 10,000 Ohms is a ball-park value for the resistance of the body 
hand-to-hand.&nbsp; This sounds like an easy requirement to meet, but 
experience shows that sometimes it is overlooked.&nbsp; Often a small amount of 
moisture or other contamination on the battery modules, connectors or wires can 
create a leakage path that can get you in trouble.&nbsp; With battery pack 
voltages getting near 200, and in one case 340, Volts, this is a technical 
detail that requires design attention.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> Looking over the vehicles is interesting, informative and fun.&nbsp; (It 
is how I got my start.) If you have the interest and can be there Friday and 
Saturday May 8th and 9th, NESEA would love to have you volunteer.&nbsp; Those 
with knowledge and experience with cars, fuel systems, or electricity are 
particularly welcome, as they need many eyes to look all over the 
vehicles.&nbsp; They will also need folks to write down weights, measurements, 
and information, time accelerations, measure stopping distances, and the 
like.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> If you would be interested in being part of the &quot;scrutineering&quot;, 
give NESEA a call at 413-774-6051.&nbsp; FAX: 413-774-6053.&nbsp; E-mail: 
transp@nesea.org.&nbsp; I know they will be glad to hear from you.&nbsp;</p>

<pre> EVENTS </pre> 
<p> The 10th annual NESEA Tour will include ten events in eight communities 
during the week of May 8-14.&nbsp; Each community has formed a committee to 
work with NESEA to make each stopover exciting &amp; informative.&nbsp; Please 
join us in thanking the over 150 people working on these events! If you would 
like to join the fun, please contact us.&nbsp; Following are reports on events 
and committee activities.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> NEW YORK: The NESEA Tour will be returning to the South Street Seaport 
Marketplace for a gala weekend event and technical testing.&nbsp; On the Friday 
before, school groups, the automotive press, and SAE/NESEA TopTec participants 
will be invited to a special display and Ride &amp; Drive in Queens.&nbsp; The 
committee, made up of sponsor representatives, the Industrial Designer Society 
of America, the Long Island Jr.&nbsp; Solar Sprint, and the Council on the 
Environment, are working on creative ways to get their members involved.&nbsp; 
John Mlynick, musician and NESEA member, will take charge of the stage.&nbsp; 
Pre-event activities and publicity are a high priority for the committee.&nbsp; 
They are also reaching out to area bike clubs to encourage them to schedule 
biking events that include the NESEA Tour.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> NEW JERSEY: The NJ DOT's electric vehicle demonstration project, Power 
Commute, and Pat and Mike Skelly, five-year NESEA Tour volunteers, were the 
decisive factors in attracting us to New Jersey.&nbsp; New Jersey's problems 
with pollution, population density and demographics are also perfect for EVs! 
We will be stopping in three communities.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> MORRISTOWN, NJ: MCRides, the MorrisCounty rideshare company, is our host 
as well as host to the Power Commute program.&nbsp; With a Mothers' Day theme 
of &quot;Rides for Moms,&quot; we will congregate at the train station Sunday 
afternoon.&nbsp; Members of the community and Power Commute partners will offer 
rides, food &amp; music, plus lots of kids will make this a great afternoon! 
Mike Bianci, long-time announcer and chronicler of the NESEA Tour, is helping 
here in his home town.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> PRINCETON, NJ: The Princeton High School will be the setting for our 
overnight stop, and an early Monday morning event for area school 
children.&nbsp; The Greater Mercer County Metropolitan Transit Authority, a 
Power Commute partner, is taking the lead here, and will bring vehicles for 
rides!</p> 
<p> BURLINGTON COUNTY INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY (BCIT), located near another 
rideshare program, Cross County Connections, is the host for this all- day 
Monday event.&nbsp; Pat and Mike Skelly invited Joyce Goldsmith of Burlington 
County Waste Management to get involved.&nbsp; Between the three of them, and 
BCIT, they must know everyone in Burlington County, and they have gotten 
everyone involved! A morning Jr.&nbsp; Solar Sprint event, workshops for kids, 
shuttle buses from neighboring Mt. Holly, and an evening program will make this 
a fun and educational event.&nbsp; Burlington County is home to DEP 
Commissioner Shinn, who he will come and invite the governor! Entrants can 
recharge Monday afternoon, before setting out for Delaware.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> DELAWARE: This is our first trip to Delaware, and they are rolling out the 
red carpet for us.&nbsp; The Colonial School District is taking the lead on 
creating a Tuesday morning event for students in NEW CASTLE, and they are 
working hard to incorporate the technological aspects of the Tour into their 
spring semester curriculum.&nbsp; The cars will then drive down along the 
Delaware River to DOVER.&nbsp; We expect both kids and state legislators to 
join us for lunch at the beautiful Capitol Complex.&nbsp; The entrants will 
then have an opportunity to demonstrate their range capabilities.&nbsp; 
Wednesday morning we will hold an event for the students at POLYTECH-WOODSIDE, 
who are especially excited to see us, since they have a program that involves 
EV technology!</p> 
<p> MARYLAND: The NESEA Tour will return to Sandy Point State Park, which 
overlooks the Chesapeake Bay, for a mid-day Wednesday event with area 
students.&nbsp; An afternoon Autocross event will be hosted by the Greater DC 
Area Sports Car Club of America.&nbsp; The Maryland Departments of Energy 
Administration and the Department of Natural Resources are taking the lead in 
reaching out to area businesses, who will both exhibit and become sponsors of 
school buses.&nbsp; We all hope to match our success of two years ago when over 
1500 students were bussed to the NESEA Tour!</p> 
<p> WASHINGTON, DC: Pennsylvania Ave and 3rd Street, with the Capitol building 
as the backdrop, will be the site of our final celebration on Thursday.&nbsp; 
The DC Jr.&nbsp; Solar Sprint group, the Potomac Region Solar Energy 
Association, the Gas Guzzler Campaign, the Capitol Children's Museum and the 
Electric Vehicle Association of Greater Washington have taken the lead in 
attracting students to the event.&nbsp; We are working with Darby Enterprises, 
Copeland, Lowrey &amp; Jacquez, the Electric Transportation Coalition, the 
Energy and Environmental Study Institute, Edison Electric Institute, 
Transportation 2000 and others on invitations to the President, the Vice 
President, agency heads, and legislators.&nbsp; For those participating in the 
NESEA Tour, the finale will come at the Awards Ceremony to be held Friday after 
brunch.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Report #7: Winning by the Numbers</h2> 
<p> The NESEA American Tour de Sol US Electric Vehicle Championship, for 
indeed that is its name, is an event where being the first under the FINISH 
banner does not confer any particular honor.&nbsp; In fact, to be a 
&quot;winner&quot; an entrant must excel in many different ways _other_ than 
speed! There are points awarded for the design and execution of the car, the 
ease with which it passes the various inspections for structural integrity and 
safety, and a number of other factors before the rally even begins.&nbsp; Once 
underway, longest driving range becomes a much cherished prize.&nbsp; In this, 
the 10th American Tour de Sol, there are some new prizes worth noting.&nbsp;</p>
<p> For one, the Production Category has a &quot;public acceptance&quot; prize 
based on a 200 point scoring system where the category entrants are evaluated 
on how they compare with cars that run on internal combustion engines 
(ICE).&nbsp; Under this scoring, 100 would represent an Electric Vehicle (EV) 
&quot;equal to&quot; an ICE vehicle in its every day abilities.&nbsp; (Once 
again, top speed is not likely to dominate the figuring.)</p> 
<p> In the US Department of Energy Hybrid Category there will be a prize 
sponsored by the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation.&nbsp; 
The testing will be performed by Argonne National Laboratories and will look 
closely at the exhaust emissions.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> There will also be a &quot;City Drive&quot; in New York City which will 
award a prize awarded to the most energy efficiency EV in this most urban of 
urban settings.&nbsp; Two years ago in New York City, the `Solectria Force NMH' 
(Nickel Metal Hydride) and the `Solectria Sunrise' both turned in efficiencies 
of about 200 Watt-hours/mile on the city driving cycle.&nbsp; The `Sunrise' 
will not be here, but a `Force NMH' will be defending the title.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> For the past several years, the NESEA Challenge has awarded prizes based 
on the best overall oil-well-to-wheel-well vehicle efficiency.&nbsp; This prize 
answers the speculation that EVs might just move the pollution from the tail 
pipe to the power plant, and in fact may in fact increase overall pollution due 
to electric transmission losses.&nbsp; The numbers collected in past Tour de 
Sols say otherwise.&nbsp; They showed that a gallon of _crude_ oil taken from 
the ground, shipped to a refinery, made into gasoline, shipped to a gas 
station, pumped, and burned in an ICE car gets 35 miles per gallon of _crude 
oil_.&nbsp; Take the next gallon of oil from that same well, ship it to an 
electric power plant, generate the electricity, transmit it a house and into an 
EV's charger, charge the battery, and then drive an otherwise identical car and 
you will travel 65 miles per gallon of _crude oil_.&nbsp; And, of course, it is 
easier to keep a relatively few big, stationary electric generation facility 
burning oil in top condition than it is to keep millions of small, mobile 
engines burning gasoline and diesel fuel running as cleanly.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> In this year's NESEA Challenge, each EV will have two meters measuring 
energy in Watt-hours.&nbsp; One meter will be on the Alternating Current (AC) 
line that feeds the charger.&nbsp; The other will be in between the battery and 
the motor controller.&nbsp; This will allow more accurate measurement of the 
energy losses in the charger-and-battery subsystem.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p> As of April 1st, NESEA's count of registered competitors was: </p> 
<p> </p> 
<pre> Production Category 5 Commuter Category 12 USDOE Hybrid Category 10 
USDOE Solar Commuter Category 4 One Person Category 5 total 36 </pre> 
<p> There is also a new Demonstration Category for vehicles which will be on 
display and providing public ride-and-drives, but will not be awarded any 
prizes.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Report #8: The Return of Car 50 from Connecticut</h2> 
<p> ((This is a replacement for Report #8.&nbsp; Jim sent me an updated 
version.&nbsp; The changes are all in the paragraph that begins &quot;Car #50 
just received ...&quot;.))</p> 
<p> One of the joys of serving as a reporter of the American Tour de Sol (this 
will be my fifth year in that role), is that I get to know some of the regulars 
and they get to know me.&nbsp; So it wasn't too much of a surprise to get the 
following note from Jim Sime of the Connecticut DOT.&nbsp; It tells so clearly 
just how things have changed in the car they will be bringing back to the 
Commuter Category, that I'll just repeat the whole thing.&nbsp; Since I am 
mostly interested in the technology of the entrants, this speaks directly to 
me.&nbsp; I just _love_ those details.&nbsp;</p>

<pre> Connecticut Rideshare Solectria Force with Electrosource Horizon 
Batteries</pre> 
<p> David Fabricatore and I look forward to seeing you again at the 1998 
American Tour de Sol (ATdS).&nbsp; John Hudson will be driving the support van, 
as he did in 1996.&nbsp; This year my son William, age 10, will travel with the 
team and keep a journal.&nbsp; It should be both fun and educational for 
Will.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> John and I are researchers employed by the Connecticut Department of 
Transportation.&nbsp; This is the fourth year the Department has partnered with 
the Connecticut Rideshare Co. to participate in the American Tour de Sol.&nbsp;
</p> 
<p> David and I will again be the driver/navigator team.&nbsp; </p> 
<p> The ATdS is an important element in the Department's evaluation of 
production electric vehicles (EVs) as a means of improving urban air quality, 
reducing the use of petroleum per vehicle mile and dependence on foreign 
oil.&nbsp; Our evaluation with car #50 is examining the performance of a 
production electric car with an Advanced Lead Acid Battery (ALAB).&nbsp; The 
ALAB being evaluated is an 85 Amp-hour valve-regulated lead-acid 
electric-vehicle battery.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> Since last year we have upgraded the motor and belt drive system on our 
1995 Force.&nbsp; The car actually had a 1994-production year motor and 
belt-type drive train.&nbsp; The five 4-door sedans purchased by The 
Connecticut Rideshare Co. may have been the last Forces built before Solectria 
changed its standard drive train to the quieter direct-drive design.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> Car #50 just received a factory upgrade of its motor and drive train, so 
under the hood it's essentially a 1998 Force.&nbsp; A model ACgtx20 replaced 
the original Solectria motor, model ACgv20.&nbsp; This new AC induction motor 
delivers 43-45 HP and is a brushless sealed design and weighs 78 pounds 
(lbs.).&nbsp; It is compact and has extremely low electrical resistance.&nbsp; 
Nominal power of the ACgtx20 is 12 kW and nominal torque is 20 Nm, while 
maximum power and torque are 37 kW and 70 Nm, respectively.&nbsp; Nominal motor 
speed is 4,000 rpm, while maximum motor speed is 12,000 rpm.&nbsp; The motor 
has an efficiency of 92%.&nbsp; A Solectria model AT1200 gearbox with the 
standard 12:1 gear ratio replaced the belt drive assembly.&nbsp; The gearbox is 
lightweight, weighing 35 pounds.&nbsp; The factory upgrade also included 
watertight electrical connectors, an Electromagnetic Interference (EMI) sock to 
improve radio reception, and a new-design fuse box.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> The car is equipped with Electrosource Horizon advanced lead-acid 
batteries, a 220 volt charging system and the Badicheq computerized battery 
management system.&nbsp; All thirteen Electrosource horizon batteries were 
replaced with a new set of 85 Amp Hour Horizon batteries.&nbsp; A pack of 
thirteen batteries powers the car.&nbsp; The Horizon is a valve-regulated 
advanced lead acid battery.&nbsp; Inside are lead-fiberglass wire woven into 
lightweight mesh.&nbsp; The mesh is coated with an electrochemical paste.&nbsp; 
The design uses a starved electrolyte system and gas recombination.&nbsp; They 
are maintenance free, spill-proof, and can be mounted in any position.&nbsp; 
Battery attributes are: rapid recharge, high peak power (450- 500 W/kg, 30 
seconds @ 50% Depth of Discharge (DOD), terminal limited), 85 Ah capacity, 41 
Wh/kg, 90 Wh/l, 12 V, 24.9 kg per battery, and 400-cycle life at 70% DOD.&nbsp; 
[1]</p> 
<p> Gus Sfakianos at Neocon Technologies Inc. in Long Island, NY replaced the 
on- board 12 Amp, 220-Volt Mentzer battery charger with a 22 Amp, 220 Volt 
K&amp;W Charger.&nbsp; The charger is still controlled by a Badicheq 
computerized battery management system, but our Badicheq did receive a software 
upgrade.&nbsp; Also, the laptop computer and Badicheq laptop software were 
upgraded to the new Windows 95 version.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> For the past three years we ran Goodyear Invicta GL radial tires, size 
P155/80R13.&nbsp; This is a 44-psi tire with a treadwear rating of 280, 
traction rating A and temperature rating B.&nbsp; The Invicta weighs about 14.5 
lbs. and has a maximum load rating of 959 lbs. (3,836 lbs. for a set of 
four).&nbsp; For the 1998 ATdS, Goodyear sent us Intrepid radial tires, size 
175/70R13. This 44-psi tire has a rated load capacity of 1,047 lbs. (4,188 lbs. 
for four) and a treadwear rating of 380; traction rating A; and, temperature 
rating B.&nbsp; The Intrepid weighs about 1 lb. more than the Invicta.&nbsp; 
Also, the Intrepid has a 5.25-inch tire width, about 7/8-inch wider than the 
Invicta.&nbsp; However, the width of tire-to-pavement contact appears to be 
only 0.125 inch wider when the width of the &quot;rain channel&quot; is 
subtracted from the overall width of the Intrepid.&nbsp; We will pursue a 
comparison of EV efficiency with these two tire models after the ATdS.&nbsp;</p>
<p> The wider Goodyear Intrepid tire led us to purchase a wider wheel as 
well.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> We selected a 10-lb.&nbsp; Panasport 13x5.5 inch alloy wheel.&nbsp; The 
Intrepid/Panasport tire and wheel combination is 2 lbs. lighter than last 
year's Invicta mounted on a steel wheel with hubcap.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> That's about it for changes to Car #50.&nbsp; Again, we look forward to 
seeing you on May 8, 1998.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Report #9: Light Happens</h2> 
<p> The day dawned cool and gray over the New York Hall of Science in the 
Flushing area of New York City today (Friday the 8th of May).&nbsp; The weather 
report said to expect showers.&nbsp; The early arrivers were already setting up 
a couple of tents and the NESEA traveling solar array, and a couple of electric 
cars and an electric school bus were already in evidence.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> As the day progressed, the promised showers arrived, but so did more and 
more American Tour de Sol entrants, and bus load after bus load of school 
kids.&nbsp; &quot;How far does it go?&quot; &quot;What do you do when there is 
no sun?&quot; &quot;High school kids built _that_!?&quot; &quot;How much does 
it cost?&quot; &quot;Where can I get one?&quot; These were some of the 
questions heard.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> And your loyal reporter was there, sticking his microcassette recorder 
under the nose of many a team member, getting their stories and learning about 
the trucks, vans, cars, bicycles and tricycles entered by corporations, 
colleges, high schools, a middle school, and individuals.&nbsp; We expect them 
to come from as far away as Florida and Canada, Arizona, California and 
Washington State.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> We'll see the first fuel cell powered Tour de Sol vehicle, from a 
surprising source.&nbsp; We'll see one of the biggest entrants, and some of the 
smallest.&nbsp; We'll see vehicles with sophisticated computer controls, and 
vehicles with manual controls.&nbsp; We'll see a vehicle with 2 gear boxes and 
2 shift levers.&nbsp; We'll see teams that have had woeful difficulties in the 
past come back to try again, and we'll see winners defending their 
titles.&nbsp; We'll see teams trying to run as much as possible on pure sun 
light, teams that will charge from the grid, teams that will burn fuels to 
generate their own electricity, and teams that will both charge and burn a 
fuel.&nbsp; We'll even see a demonstration vehicle that gets it's electricity 
from light, but not the sun.&nbsp; We'll see the only production 
hybrid-electric car being sold to the public.&nbsp; And much more.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> So stick around.&nbsp; Over the next week or so I'll try to be your eyes 
and ears here at the electric vehicle event where the rubber hits the everyday, 
city- town-and-country roads of the north eastern United States.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> Oh.&nbsp; You want to know where the Report title &quot;Light 
Happens&quot; comes from? It's a bumper sticker on one of the entrants.&nbsp;
</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p> </p> 
<h2>Report #10: Team Profile - `Garnet One'</h2> 
<p> OK.&nbsp; I admit it.&nbsp; When I saw the entrant from Swarthmore College 
last year, I didn't hold out much hope for it completing the race (an opinion I 
kept to myself).&nbsp; It was a bit of a rats nest of wires and tubes.&nbsp; 
Not only was the electrical wiring all over the place, and none of it seemed to 
be labeled or color coded, but the tubing for the Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) 
fuel also seemed a bit distracted; not quite sure where it was going.&nbsp; But 
the team proved me wrong.&nbsp; In spite of a few problems, they kept it going 
and did quite well.&nbsp; They even won a prize: the Blue Sky Club &quot;Team 
Spirit Award&quot;, for staying happy in the face of adversity.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> Well, `Garnet One' (Number 62) returns with a new team and a very neat and 
refined look befitting the lines of the Beretta car used as a platform.&nbsp; 
And I said so when I spoke with the team members.&nbsp; &quot;That's because we 
basicly changed everything except for the major components like the DC motor 
and the internal combustion engine.&nbsp; We rewired the whole car, fixed up 
mechanical problems we had before, strengthened the battery box, replaced the 
exhaust system, fixed the cooling system, and added an instrument panel full of 
analog meters.&nbsp; Last year all the measurements were fed into a computer 
and it was a pain in the neck.&nbsp; It didn't work and it was difficult for 
the driver and passenger to know what was going on with the car.&quot; Although 
it has taken a lot of time and a few parts, there were not any major expenses 
to be paid, so funding has not been a major issue.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> The original team members, who created the car as a senior design project, 
graduated last year and are now working.&nbsp; The team this year is all new 
members, and the car has been their senior project.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> Finding CNG was a problem for the team last year, as we traveled up 
through Vermont and New Hampshire.&nbsp; They were given permission to plug in 
to charge for the portion of the route where they could not find fuel.&nbsp; 
This year they did their homework and have found fuel all along the way.&nbsp;
</p> 
<p> Most of the past 12 months the car has been in the shop being overhauled, 
but during the past two months they've put about 400 miles on it, getting it 
ready for the NESEA Tour.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Report #11: Team Profile - `Solar Tiger II'</h2> 
<p> (History Lesson - Part 1) </p> 
<pre> There is a history of electric vehicles that is not widely talked about 
or</pre> even very well known.&nbsp; During the 1960's and 1970's, there were a 
number of attempts to bring EVs to the American market that didn't quite work 
out.&nbsp; One of those was a thing known as the &quot;Zipper&quot; (Have I 
spelled that right? It may have one or three p's.), that held two people, had 3 
wheels with rear-wheel drive, an ABS plasic body, and reminds one of the little 
patrol vehicles you see today.&nbsp; Not many were built.&nbsp;
<p> (History Lesson - Part 2) </p> 
<pre> Last year the team from Union-Endicott High School worked very hard on a 
</pre> ground-up vehicle that never crossed the starting line.&nbsp; Severe 
problems with the brakes and steering kept them from passing the technical 
inspections, and so they were not allowed to race.&nbsp; They did display their 
car at each of the stops along the way, though.&nbsp;
<p> Fate smiled on the Technology Club in the person of the retired CEO of EZ 
Red Battery in Deposit NY.&nbsp; He had the only Zipper truck ever built and 
was looking to give it a home.&nbsp; It had been sitting for a while and would 
need work, but would the Club be interested?</p> 
<p> They sure were.&nbsp; They redesigned the truck bed, changed the batteries 
from 48 Volts to 72 Volts, put in a modern controller, replaced the steering, 
replaced the shocks and brakes, replaced the windshield, added a radio, and 
gave it a new paint job.&nbsp; Increasing the battery voltage also required 
reconfiguring the battery layout and adding cooling fans.&nbsp; Originally the 
battery blocks were all in the front.&nbsp; Now 8 blocks are in the front and 4 
are in the back.&nbsp; This layout has improved the handling by balancing the 
weight better.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> The car has been operational for about 2 weeks, but they have not yet 
tested the range limitations of the car.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> At the end of my interview, the Western Washington University team helped 
make a repair by doing a bit of welding to repair a shock mount that broke 
while the car was being trailed to the Tour.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> Later in the day, I found the car up on jacks again, and they were 
attempting to repair part of the steering system.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> Here's hoping they can be ready for the start on Sunday.&nbsp; </p>

<h2>Report #12: Team Profile - `Viking 23'</h2> 
<p> The group from Western Washington University keeps coming back with 
interesting vehicles.&nbsp; This time, it superficially looks like the car they 
brought to the 1996 American Tour de Sol, but Rosanne Gile, the team captain 
who was also on that rally, tells me that it is quite different.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> As before, its front wheels are driven with an electric motor and its rear 
wheels are driven with an internal combustion engine (ICE).&nbsp; &quot;We've 
replaced the 900 cc Honda racing motorcycle engine and with a 3 cylinder, 1 
liter Diahatsu burning reformulated gasoline (RFG).&nbsp; The old motorcycle 
transmission that was used in the front failed at the last competition, so 
we've mated a Suburu 4-speed to the motor.&nbsp; This means we have automotive 
transmissions both front and rear, where before we had motorcycle 
transmissions, so we have a different shifting pattern to deal with.&nbsp; We 
still have two separate shifters, although they are now on two separate shift 
levers, where before there was one lever with a gate between them.&quot; I 
notice that the shift levers have different shapes.&nbsp; I suspect that is to 
help the driver differentiate them.&nbsp; It looks confusing, &quot;but you 
just leave the electric in 3rd most of the time, so there not a problem.&quot; 
And you only have to manage the ICE when it is on.&nbsp; The general driving 
pattern is to start out in electric, and add the ICE when you need the power 
for hills or the range for cruising.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> There is no charging capability from the ICE to the batteries.&nbsp; So 
they have to both charge the batteries and add fuel.&nbsp; Oh, yes.&nbsp; And 
there is also the solar panels that cover just about every horizontal surface 
of the car.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> I asked where they intended to get the RFG fuel during the rally? &quot;We 
drove to California, picked the fuel up, and we have it.&nbsp; In California 
RFG is the standard you buy at the pump.&quot;</p> 
<p> The car is built real low to the ground, and has a long, sleek look.&nbsp; 
The body tilts up at the front to let the driver and passenger in to very laid 
back seats.&nbsp; The ICE engine sits across the back of the vehicle so there 
is no rear window.&nbsp; Which means there is no rear-view mirror.&nbsp; 
Instead a black-and-white TV camera is built into the tail and a small monitor 
on the dash board shows the driver what's following her.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> This rework of `Viking 23' was done by a team of five people, Rosanne 
said, taking majors in Vehicle Design and Manufacturing Engineering 
Technology.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Report #13: Demonstration Vehicle - `Viking 29'</h2> 
<p> The Western Washington University Vehicle Research Institute (VRI) has 
brought another car along, for display, and while it looks somewhat like its 
stable mate, `Viking 23', there is a difference.&nbsp; It runs on light, but 
not sunlight.&nbsp; Instead it is powered by a Thermophotovoltaic (TPV) 
generator, also referred to as Midnight Sun(R), developed by the VRI and JX 
Crystals of Issaquah WA.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> Picture a canister a bit smaller than a 1 gallon paint can.&nbsp; Up the 
middle of that can, place a ceramic tube.&nbsp; On the inside wall of the can 
place solar cells.&nbsp; Burn a fuel inside the ceramic tube, making it hot and 
therefore it glows.&nbsp; The solar cells in turn use the light from the 
glowing tube to make electricity.&nbsp; The fuel burns continuously, making the 
combustion complete, clean, and quiet.&nbsp; Since the solar cells are very 
close to the glowing tube, the illumination is much brighter than solar cells 
on the roof of a car.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> The silicon carbide ceramic tube glows brightly in the infrared light 
spectrum, at a wave length of about 0.8 to 1.8 microns, and part of the design 
challenge is to match the brightest part of the glowing tube spectrum to most 
sensitive wavelengths of the photovoltaic cells.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> In `Viking 29', there are 8 such canisters, burning Compressed Natural Gas 
(CNG) illuminating gallium antimonide photovoltaic cells at 1700 degrees 
Kelvin.&nbsp; The 10 kiloWatts produced is stored in a 10 kiloWatt-hour, 260 
Volt pack of Saft NiCad batteries.&nbsp; That drives a Unique Mobility 75 kW 
motor connected through a 4-speed, wide ratio transaxle to the rear 
wheels.&nbsp; The canisters are surrounded by a water jacket which takes the 
heat to a large radiator.&nbsp; All this is surrounded by a body of composite 
materials in a vinyl- ester matrix.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> A car of the future? Michael Seal, director of the VRI thinks it might be 
but it is be too early to tell.&nbsp; The car was finished just before they 
left to come to the Tour, and so only has about 20 miles on it.&nbsp; &quot;The 
car was built for the Department of Energy, and the TPVs were built for the 
Department of Defense.&nbsp; The car is going to Washington to be shown the 
sponsors.&quot;</p> 
<p> What is the overall efficiency of producing electricity this way? 
&quot;It's still very early days in this technology.&nbsp; Right now our best 
is about 8 percent.&nbsp; We guess that 30%, or even more, is obtainable.&nbsp; 
Our chief competitor is the fuel cell, which has an in-built advantage that it 
is inherently more efficient than TPV, but it has to run on hydrogen.&quot; But 
if you add in the cost of producing, storing, and transporting hydrogen then 
TPV can compete.&nbsp; Plus TPV can run on any available fuel.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> The Midnight Sun generators have been developed in the past 3 years.&nbsp; 
The first commercial applications are likely to be co-generation for mountain 
cabins, motor homes and yachts, where the waste heat can be used for other 
purposes.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Report #15: Team Profile - `Ed'</h2> 
<p> Last year, a team I most wanted to see was the one from Lawrence Tech in 
Michigan.&nbsp; They had built a car name `Hyades' that, after participating in 
the FutureCar Challenge in Michigan, drove all the way to Chicago.&nbsp; Would 
they drive to and from the American Tour de Sol? Well, they didn't.&nbsp; And 
when they got here they had many problems with bursting hydraulic lines, and so 
did not do very well at all.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> But, undaunted, they have returned with a rework of the same base vehicle 
that they have much greater hopes for: `Ed' (which stands for Electric 
Diesel).&nbsp; Becky Steketee is the team leader and told me what else, besides 
the name, has changed.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> `Ed' uses a parallel hybrid design, with both the diesel engine and the 
electric motor connected to the transmission.&nbsp; A toothed belt from the 
electric motor passes through a hole in the bell-housing of the transmission so 
either the engine, or the motor, or both can drive the car.&nbsp; The 
transmission is a manual, but it is shifted by a computer, so the car is driven 
as if it had a traditional automatic transmission.&nbsp; The normal driving 
strategy implemented by the computer is that the car starts off in electric 
mode.&nbsp; At about 16 kilometers per hour the diesel gets clutched in and 
pretty much takes over.&nbsp; The electric is brought back in when there is a 
need for extra power for acceleration or hill climbing.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> Unlike some, this car needs both fuel and electric charging, referred to 
as a &quot;charge depletion strategy&quot;.&nbsp; There is no ability for 
recharging the batteries from the engine.&nbsp; (Surprising to me, since the 
car has regenerative brakes based on the wheels driving the electric motor 
operating as a generator.&nbsp; It would seem to be a natural thing to have the 
diesel engine also drive the motor as a generator.)</p> 
<p> Royce Brown told me that the Nickel Metal Hydride (NiMH) battery pack has 
a sophisticated monitoring system.&nbsp; It watches the temperature and voltage 
of each battery module, reported on a LCD panel on the dashboard.&nbsp; If any 
module (made up of 11 cells) shows a high temperature or an unusual voltage, an 
alarm is raised.&nbsp; (Such a system is pretty much a necessity on advanced 
battery systems, in my opinion.&nbsp; The high energy density of these 
chemistries do not seem to tolerate over charge or over discharge at all.&nbsp; 
Last year, the car from Chico State University in California suffered a 
catastrophic overheating of their NiMH pack during an overnight charge.&nbsp; 
Their monitoring system was out of the car at the time, being bench 
tested.&nbsp; As they say, it ruined their whole day.)</p> 
<p> The solar panel on the roof automatically control a pair of fans on the 
rear roof pillars, one blowing into the cabin and the other blowing out.&nbsp; 
When the cabin temperature gets above 85 degrees F, the fans turn on to exhaust 
the hot air.&nbsp; It also recharges the accessory battery.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> One thing you don't notice about the car until you try to get into it is 
that there are no door handles.&nbsp; I don't mean that they are recessed into 
the body, or built into the door jamb (as in the Chevy Beretta used by `Garnet 
One').&nbsp; I mean there is no door handles.&nbsp; A button on a key fob 
causes the door to pop open a couple of inches.&nbsp; You then just grab the 
door jamb.&nbsp; (I think there could be a safety issue here.&nbsp; What if a 
person outside is pulling on the door jamb just as a person outside is pulling 
the door closed? Those fingers are going to get caught! Oooch!)</p>

<h2>Report #16: Demonstration Vehicle - `Ford Electric Ranger'</h2> 
<p> Tracy Lanciano, a Vehicle Engineer, and Bill Royle, Sales Manager for 
Alternative Fuel Vehicles, from Ford were in Flushing with an Electric 
Ranger.&nbsp; Whenever I see someone from one of the major car companies I 
always ask the same question.&nbsp; If I want to be an early adaptor of EV 
technology, and I am not a fleet owner, can I purchase one of these?</p> 
<p> &quot;Yes, you can,&quot; said Bill.&nbsp; &quot;It's $35,000, unless you 
want to lease it at $633 per month.&nbsp; You can have one today.&nbsp; We have 
a toll-free number, 1-800-ALT-FUEL (258-3835), which will answer questions 
about any of the eleven alternate fuel vehicles Ford builds.&nbsp; That 
includes literature, where's my closest dealer, or where can I get one.&nbsp; 
The trucks are not readily available everywhere, by design.&nbsp; 50 of the 
4500 Ford dealers are authorized to sell the Electric Rangers.&nbsp; Those 
dealers are in Alabama, Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, 
Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Jersey, New 
York, Ohio, Oklahoma, and Washington.&quot;</p> 
<p> The Electric Ranger will be on display in New York City and Washington DC 
only.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Report #17: Team Profile - `Slipstream'</h2> 
<p> In the past, the Cornell team has arrived with vehicles named after bad 
weather: things like `Tusnami', `Vortex', `Blizzard' and `Tempest'.&nbsp; So 
`Slipstream' (Number 14) sounds less ominous.&nbsp; Barkley Hershey and Peter 
Kung told me about it.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> The design is similar to ones they have used before.&nbsp; There are two 
motors driving the rear wheels, an AC induction motor for efficiency and a 
brushed DC motor for hill climbing and hard acceleration.&nbsp; On top of that, 
there is a Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) fueled engine for generating 
electricity to give the car about 300 miles range.&nbsp; The DC motor has a 
clutch on it, to avoid it presenting a load when it is not being powered or the 
car is backing up.&nbsp; The AC induction motor is directly connected, and can 
be driven backwards when the car needs to back up.&nbsp; The AC motor also 
provides regenerative braking.&nbsp; &quot;We only use the DC motor for 20 to 
30 seconds max.&quot; It all adds up to quite a package.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> The choices between AC vs.&nbsp; DC are under computer control, as is the 
decision to start the engine.&nbsp; The &quot;vehicle automation system&quot; 
provides the interface between the accelerator pedal and the two electric motor 
controllers.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> The electric part has been working since February.&nbsp; The CNG engine 
has been working since March.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> The 30 Watt Solar panel charges the 12 Volt battery that is used for 
lights, horn, radio and such.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> The team has half mechanical engineers and half electrical engineers.&nbsp;
</p> 
<p> Cornell was having some difficulties.&nbsp; During technical inspection, 
the safety people were not happy with the materials used for the fuel lines and 
clamps.&nbsp; They were able to get suitable replacements.&nbsp; They were also 
have trouble with one of their E-Meters (which measure the motors energy 
usages) which was resetting every time the car went into regenerative 
braking.&nbsp; They hoped to have that repaired soon.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Report #18: Team Profile - `Helios the Heron V'</h2> 
<p> I've been doing these Reports for five years now, and each of those years 
there has been a `Helios the Heron' built by the 4th through 8th grade students 
of the Riverside School in Lyndonville Vermont.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> This year they are back again with the same VW microbus they had last 
year, and a group of kids just bubbling over with energy and enthusiasm for 
what they have done.&nbsp; The van itself sports many improvements.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> What are those improvements? I didn't have to ask twice.&nbsp; &quot;We 
have 5 new solar panels on the side of the bus.&nbsp; We have regenerative 
braking hooked up.&nbsp; We have a two new charges.&nbsp; We have nine new 
batteries.&nbsp; We have a new battery monitoring system.&quot;</p> 
<p> A battery monitoring system? That's something the college teams are 
claiming.&nbsp; &quot;We connected telephone wires to each battery terminal, so 
we don't have to open up the box&quot; to read each battery's voltage.&nbsp; 
&quot;You plug a telephone cord plug into the panel for each battery (module), 
connect the voltmeter, and it gives you the reading.&quot; Last year they 
opened the battery boxes each morning and read the module voltages by touching 
each pair of terminals.&nbsp; This should make the process much easier and 
safer.&nbsp; (Some of the other teams should consider such a system.) They also 
added a &quot;little computer chip kinda thing for each battery&quot; that 
lights a lamp when the battery is full.&nbsp; It then passes &quot;the energy 
will go to the other batteries to make them full.&quot;</p> 
<p> The new solar panels, donated by University of Vermont Montpelier, add 65 
Volts to the 160 Volt panel already on the roof used to help recharge the main 
battery pack.&nbsp; They also added a diode to the solar panels so they don't 
present a load to the system when they are in the dark.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> The regenerative braking is driving an alternator that is connected to a 
charger that is fed back into the battery box.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> When the van was not at the Tour de Sol, it was used to take the kids to 
various local events and sports.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> Not everything went smoothly getting ready for the Tour.&nbsp; 
&quot;Wednesday, when we came to work on Helios, it didn't move.&nbsp; We 
didn't know what was wrong, and when we traced it, we thought it was the 
controller.&quot; They got a new controller from a source 2 hours away.&nbsp; 
&quot;We installed the (new) controller, and still it didn't work.&nbsp; That 
was last night at about 8 o'clock.&nbsp; So we were still looking for what was 
wrong.&quot; They kept looking and finally saw that the plug between the 
controller and the motor where not quite plugged in all the way.&nbsp; &quot;It 
took about 5 minutes to fix and that was all that was really wrong.&quot;</p> 
<p> They also had a ground fault, that proved to be a wire out of place.&nbsp; 
It was easily corrected.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> &quot;Also on Tuesday we were working on the E-Meter which tells us how 
much further we can run.&nbsp; And we were rewiring it, and it short circuited 
and it blew up.&nbsp; A $300 meter.&nbsp; But we got another one and got it 
installed.&quot;</p>

<h2>Report #19: Friday and Saturday: Registration, Display and Testing</h2> 
<p> No, there is no truth to the rumor that we plan to change the name of the 
event to The American Tour de Nimbus.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> Friday and Saturday, May 8th and 9th, were the first two days of the 
American Tour de Sol, and it rained quite a bit both days.&nbsp; People and 
cars were wet but spirits were not dampened.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> On Friday, at the New York Hall of Science in the Flushing neighborhood of 
New York City, the teams gathered, registered, hosted scores of school tours, 
and also met with attendees of the SAE/NESEA TOPTEC on Hybrid Vehicles at a 
picnic lunch hosted by Ford Motor Company.&nbsp; As I spoke to the teams, 
gathering the information for these reports, I could hear the pride in what 
they were accomplishing.&nbsp; For some, the old hands at this who have been 
involved with the NESEA Tour and similar events, this was getting to be a 
comfortable routine.&nbsp; For others, especially the first-time school teams, 
to whom this is all new, the Wow Factor was coming into play.&nbsp; They were 
not the only ones who did this, who had to learn the ways of electric vehicles, 
sometimes with emotionally painful (and we hope not physically painful) 
experience.&nbsp; There were lots of others who were doing similar things.&nbsp;
</p> 
<p> Saturday was the Day of Inspection at the South Street Sea Port in 
Manhattan.&nbsp; The overhead Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive afforded considerable 
protection from the rain for the teams and the visiting public.&nbsp; Here the 
vehicles get weighed, and measured, and tested to ensure that they meet the 
safety requirements.&nbsp; A small horde of volunteers scrutinize, looking for 
things like structural strength, brake effectiveness, and electrical, 
hydraulic, and fuel system soundness.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> Of particular concern is the dreaded ground fault, where electricity from 
the main battery pack leaks onto the car frame where it could give a nasty 
shock.&nbsp; Finding these things can be tricky and time consuming, especially 
if the wiring is messy or too well hidden inside a metal car frame.&nbsp; Even 
an &quot;all composite&quot; car like `Viking 23' can have such a problem, and 
they did.&nbsp; A dirty battery top and dried electrolyte spill on the frame 
can present enough of a current path to give you a tingle.&nbsp; A quick clean 
up solved the problem.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> In addition to the basic safety tests, the vehicle handling around traffic 
cones, acceleration, ability to start on a hill, engineering elegance, 
practicality, and educational display and team appearance are awarded points 
called &quot;Tour Miles&quot;.&nbsp; Extra miles are awarded for passing the 
technical requirements readily.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> The Saturday New York Times ran a piece on the ATdS feature a picture of 
cars lined up in Flushing, and one of the `Helios the Heron V' team standing by 
their pride and joy.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> On Sunday at 1 PM, the movable feast will start to move in earnest, from 
South Street Sea Port to the train station in Morristown NJ.&nbsp; Then at 5 
PM, we move on to the Princeton NJ High School.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p> </p> 
<h2>Report #20: Team Profile - `Project e- 2'</h2> 
<p> The team from Mount Everett Regional High School in Sheffield MA has been 
at the ATdS for the past five years with an electric, and then a 
hybrid-electric pick-up truck known as `Project e-' (pronounced &quot;E 
Minus&quot;).&nbsp; Not this year.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> They are back with something different.&nbsp; Very different! A recumbent 
tricycle, which puts it in the One Person Category, with an H-Power hydrogen 
fuel cell, which makes it a Hybrid!!</p> 
<p> So the first fuel-cell powered vehicle brought to the American Tour de Sol 
comes from a high school team.&nbsp; Is there any doubt that these people are 
helping to invent the future?</p> 
<p> Josh Brooks and Jason Cross told me that they just got the fuel cell on 
Tuesday night, and they just got the brakes working on Thursday.&nbsp; 
&quot;With just the electric power we can go about 20 miles per hour and do 
about 30 miles.&quot; With pedaling and with the fuel they see themselves going 
much further.&nbsp; &quot;It is really easy (to ride).&nbsp; Once you get it up 
to speed and into high gear, it's minimal effort to keep it going 30 miles per 
hour.&quot;</p> 
<p> The trike is very low to the ground, with one wheel out in front on a long 
bar, and a pair of wheels with the seat, battery, fuel cell, and solar panel 
between them.&nbsp; It is steered with a pair of vertical levers, one on either 
side of the rider, who sits with his elbows at his side.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> Push on one lever, pull on the other, and push rod turns the front 
wheel.&nbsp; Controls for the motor and horn are on the left hand, brake lights 
are on the right hand.&nbsp; Normal bicycle squeeze handles control the front 
and rear brakes.&nbsp; Switches on a panel below the rider's left elbow control 
head lights and system power.&nbsp; The pedal crank is mounted a bit rear of 
the front wheel, with a gear and chain that brings the human power back to the 
rear wheels.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> The fuel cell itself is just an aluminum cube, maybe a foot on a side, 
with an on-off switch.&nbsp; Inside a door are a number (4? I couldn't quite 
see) of small, black pressure vessels which store the hydrogen in metal 
hydride.&nbsp; They are filled from an external tank via a gas 
connection.&nbsp; That process takes two or three hours.&nbsp; The battery is 
also plugged in every night.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Report #21: Team Profile - `Kineticar III'</h2> 
<p> Another team with a long and distinguished history at the NESEA Tour goes 
by the tongue-twister CSERT-NVCTC.&nbsp; In English, that's Connecticut Solar 
Electric Race Team - Naugatuck Valley Community Technical College.&nbsp; Eric 
Rabuse says this is their eighth year with us and they are quite proud that 
they have always completed all of their legs and never had to tow.&nbsp;</p>

lever-and-vacuum-actuator arrangement connects the accelerator pedal to both 
the engine throttle and the motor controller potentiometer.&nbsp; When the 
engine is not running or has not yet started sufficiently to develop power, the 
actuator keeps the throttle from flooding the engine.&nbsp; Once the engine is 
well and truly running, the engine vacuum causes the actuator to change the 
lever arrangement so the pedal input is also connected to the throttle.&nbsp; 
The result is the engine can be started while underway and it integrates its 
contribution of power automatically.&nbsp; The clutch isolates the engine when 
in pure-electric mode.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> This year the team replaced the clutch between the engine and motor with a 
Maxitorq donated by Carlyle Johnson.&nbsp; They find that it is much more 
reliable.&nbsp; &quot;We have driven 450 miles before the race, and started to 
develop some good drivers.&quot; (This strikes me as a good plan.&nbsp; Too 
many teams have their drivers getting familiar with their vehicles as the go 
under the Start banner.)</p> 
<p> Between races, the truck has a community service mission.&nbsp; &quot;We 
use it for demonstrations on Earth Day, and go to schools to show the kids what 
could they be doing in college and what the learning curve is like when you are 
on a design team making a vehicle.&nbsp; I didn't know anything about propane, 
carburization, clutches, hybrid configurations, batteries or motors.&nbsp; 
After this project I find I'm on the forefront of this stuff.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> &quot;I've been following the team since I was a sophomore in high 
school.&nbsp; I saw Kineticar I (which was a Ford Escort conversion).&nbsp; 
This was when the range was under 60 miles.&nbsp; That got me hooked.&nbsp; I 
started a Hybrid Club in school, but we didn't develop a vehicle.&nbsp; When I 
got to college, I joined the team.&nbsp; With an advisor like Don Narducci, who 
has been doing this since the beginning we have accomplished a lot.&quot;</p>

<h2>Report #23: Day 1 Race Summary</h2> 
<p> Sunday, May 10th was much the same as Saturday.&nbsp; It rained and rained 
and rained.&nbsp; Much of the time it was a drizzle with a light breeze, but 
occasionally it was much more with high winds.&nbsp; But the Tour de Sol goes 
on.&nbsp; After all the mission is to show that electric and hybrid-electric 
vehicles can be practical transportation, and that doesn't mean just when the 
sun shines.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> So the vehicles left South Street Sea Port, on the eastern shore of 
Manhattan, drove across town to the Lincoln Tunnel on the western shore, and 
then through New Jersey to Morristown, a trip of about 30 miles.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> The Hybrids took a longer route, up to the George Washington Bridge, and 
then across the Hudson River and over to Morristown.&nbsp; The Hybrids had to 
do this because there are restrictions on taking bottled Liquid Petroleum Gas 
through the tunnels.&nbsp; To keep the rally fair within the Hybrid category, 
all the entrants drove the same 48 mile route.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> Even so, the first cars under the Finish banner were #8 `Electric Lion' 
from Pennsylvania State University and #7 `TU ParaDyne' from the University of 
Tulsa Oklahoma.&nbsp; It took them just under an hour and a half, and they 
averaged about 35 miles per hour.&nbsp; This is not unusual when the Tour goes 
through metropolitan areas, as the routes tend to be off the major 
highways.&nbsp; Heavy weather and the fact that this was Mother's Day probably 
added to the times.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> #10 the `Honda EV Plus' add the best time on the shorter route, averaging 
just under 20 miles per hour.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> So here are the results, taken off the Day 1 data sheet compiled by 
NESEA.&nbsp; As always, these results are subject to change and the final 
results are not final until NESEA publishes them.&nbsp; Your humble reporter is 
doing the best he can here, but ...&nbsp;</p> 
<p> The teams marked (Not Here) are ones I have not seen and suspect had to 
drop out before they got here.&nbsp; However, we have had teams join the rally 
mid-route, so again this is what I know, not necessarily truth.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Report #24: Team Profile - `The Olympian'</h2> 
<p> Ben Fratto spoke with me about the car known as `The Olympian' from 
Cinnaminson NJ High School.&nbsp; &quot;The car was started two years ago by 
Michelle and Jesse, as it says on the car.&nbsp; It's powered by 12 Horizon 
blocks, in series for 144 Volts, and a range extending pack of 10 Yellow Top 
Optimas for 120 Volts.&quot; The Horizons occupy what used to be the back seat 
area and some of the trunk, and the Optimas are under the hood and at the back 
of the trunk.&nbsp; &quot;When (the Horizon pack) goes down to maybe 80 
percent, you just change the batteries.&nbsp; We use the emergency disconnect, 
next to the driver.&quot; Pulling on a red handle separates the big Anderson 
connectors from the main pack to the controller.&nbsp; The connector from the 
spare pack can then be inserted in its place.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> Horizon batteries are pretty sophisticated and expensive batteries for a 
high school team.&nbsp; I asked how that came about.&nbsp; &quot;We sent a 
picture of our team and a request for some support.&nbsp; They decided to 
support us and provided 12 blocks worth about $5000.&nbsp; We were not sure we 
could make the 70 miles required by the Tour, so we decided to add the $1000 
worth of Optimas.&quot;</p> 
<p> There are two chargers.&nbsp; &quot;For the Horizons, its a K&amp;W BC250 
prototype at 144 Volts.&nbsp; For the Optimas, since the BC250 cannot change 
voltages, we are using a Lester and hoping they don't get damaged during the 
week.&nbsp; We sort of bought the Optimas for the week.&nbsp; I know its a 
$1000 wasted, but if it gets us through ...&quot;</p>

<h2>Report #25: Team Profile - CitiVan</h2> 
<p> In the first American Tour de Sol, there was a team from MIT.&nbsp; In 
that team was a young man named James Worden, who had built his first electric 
car in high school, and who went on to found the Solectria Corporation, which 
still builds electric cars.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> Along the way, Solectria has been the first to champion controversial 
causes.&nbsp; They were early believers in AC induction motors and regenerative 
braking.&nbsp; Now all the electric vehicles from the major auto manufacturers 
use AC induction motors (or their first cousin, the permanent magnet brushless 
DC motor) and regen braking.&nbsp; Solectria built an EV pickup truck based on 
the Chevy S-10.&nbsp; Now Chevy makes an Electric S-10.&nbsp; Solectria put 
Ovonic Nickel Metal Hydride (NiMH) batteries in their Force car.&nbsp; Now 
Honda and Toyota use NiMH and most of the rest are saying they will.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> So what's a little company to do? How about a big electric delivery 
van.&nbsp; I spoke with Beth Silverman, Marketing Manager at Solectria.&nbsp;
</p> 
<p> &quot;We started the CitiVan project almost exactly a year ago.&nbsp; So 
far we have delivered three vans and we've got purchase orders for about 
half-a-dozen.&nbsp; And there are more customers that are `hot'.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> &quot;The vehicles are being built in Wilmington MA, right now, but we're 
hoping that they'll be big enough that we'll have to move (production) to 
another location in Massachusetts.&quot; (I have heard a periodic rumor that 
Solectria would put a shop in South Boston.&nbsp; Beth neither confirmed nor 
denied that one.)</p> 
<p> The base price is $49,950, with lead acid batteries.&nbsp; It will do 40 
to 45 miles per charge.&nbsp; Cabin heat is provided by a gasoline or diesel 
heater where 5 gallons will last about a week and, of course, heat from fuel 
doesn't reduce the vehicle range.&nbsp; Our customers are power companies, 
inner-city delivery companies.&nbsp; There is a big interest for recycling 
routes.&nbsp; The types of applications we think would be very good are 
military bases, college campuses, and small, campus-type contained 
routes.&nbsp; Federal Express and UPS talk about `vertical delivery routes' 
where a truck goes from the depot to a skyscraper and the guys go up and down 
all day.&nbsp; They may only drive 10 or 20 miles.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> Delivery vehicles may go through 100 starts a day and replacing starter 
motors is a big maintenance item for those fleets.&nbsp; These don't have 
starter motors.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> General Motors supplies the glider chassis, which includes things like the 
steering wheel, axles, and brakes, but no engine.&nbsp; Union City Body 
Company, in Indiana, puts the bodies on.&nbsp; The completed, unpowered van is 
then shipped to Massachusetts where Solectria does the electrification.&nbsp;

<h2>Report #26: Day 2 Race Summary</h2> 
<p> Here are the numbers from Tuesday morning.&nbsp; Day 1 was Sunday and was 
the trip from Manhattan to Princeton, New Jersey.&nbsp; Day 2 was Monday and 
was the trip from Princeton to New Castle, Deleware.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> A few words about American Tour de Sol scoring are in order.&nbsp; First, 
all points are awarded in units of Miles, even for things that have nothing to 
do with distance.&nbsp; So, before the rally even started, most teams had Miles 
awarded during the technical inspections.&nbsp; They are not shown here.&nbsp;
</p> 
<p> Then there are Miles awarded for traveling from point-to-point during the 
rally.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> And finally, demerits for various infractions are subtracted as 
Miles.&nbsp; Most of the penalties this year are Unfinished Leg or Late 
Finish.&nbsp; Others include Late for Display or Start and Late 
Registration.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> Below, &quot;Total Miles&quot; represent the distance traveled, and 
&quot;Tour Miles&quot; refer to awarded Miles after adjustments (usually 
subtracted penalty Miles).&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Report #27: Team Profile - `The Electrifly'</h2> 
<p> Monte Gisborne, of Peterborough, Ontario Canada, returns with his red 2 
seat convertible known as `The Electrifly', and his family support team.&nbsp; 
Monte's mother and father serve either as navigator or driver of the motor home 
they are using as their support vehicle during the Tour.&nbsp; The base vehicle 
is a Pontiac Firefly, first cousin of a Geo Metro convertible.&nbsp; When not 
at the race, the car is used by Monte's wife &quot;for what it's really 
designed for, a commuter vehicle in an urban setting.&nbsp; She does about 30 
to 40 kilometers (20 to 30 miles) per day.&nbsp; She prefers the electric, so 
we are robbing it from her for the Tour de Sol.&quot;</p> 
<p> The goal this year was to &quot;improve the performance in terms of range 
and speed.&nbsp; The vehicle has been upgraded to 120 Volts.&nbsp; To save 
weight I got rid of the battery used to power the E-Meter and use a chip 
instead that allows me to use the auxiliary battery.&nbsp; I removed things 
that were not necessary, a piece of sheet metal here and there.&nbsp; I also 
now use an offboard charging system; a much more powerful 208 Volt, 3-phase, 30 
Amp system.&nbsp; We refer to it as `the refrigerator'.&nbsp; I should be able 
to get a complete charge in 3 to 4 hours.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> The team name is &quot;Enviromotive&quot;, so I asked Monte if he is 
getting into the business of EVs.&nbsp; &quot;Yes, though I'm not quitting my 
day job.&nbsp; We had a baby in August, so there is another mouth to 
feed.&nbsp; I approached the Canadian federal government and they are offering 
me a grant to do a pre-production prototype electric vehicle of my own 
design.&nbsp; The National Research Council had heard about this car, wanted to 
see it, and I took them for a test drive.&nbsp; I think what sold them was when 
I took them to the bottom of a relatively steep hill in Peterborough.&nbsp; I 
put it into 2nd gear, just matted it, and we went like a rocket up that 
hill.&nbsp; The guy was impressed by the torque electric motors can put 
out.&nbsp; The route I want to take is to build a purpose-built EV, as opposed 
to a conversion.&quot;</p> 
<p> &quot;This vehicle is sold and will be going to its new owner after the 
Tour de Sol.&nbsp; That will generate some funds to help my next venture.&quot;

<h2>Report #28: Janet's Fund</h2> 
<p> Paul O'Brien, advisor to the Project E- team, told me a story about one of 
his former students, Janet Thieriot.&nbsp; About 10 years ago, while she was a 
student at Mt Everett Regional, Janet died of cancer.&nbsp; Her parents sued 
the health maintenance organization involved for misdiagnosis and recently won 
a large settlement.&nbsp; They said, &quot;this is not our money.&nbsp; It 
belongs to Janet.&quot; So they decided to do something they thought their 
daughter would approve.&nbsp; Thus the &quot;Janet's Fund&quot; endowment was 
born.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> Once a year a board of governors reviews fund requests from Mt Everett 
students for projects.&nbsp; They then award Janet's Fund grants to the ones 
they consider best.&nbsp; `Project e- 2' was one of two proposals awarded in 
this, the first year.&nbsp; So on the side of the vehicle you will see a logo 
for &quot;Janet's Fund&quot;.&nbsp;</p>

<p> </p> 
<h2>Report #29: Demonstration Vehicle - `Toyota Prius'</h2> 
<p> The `Toyota Prius' is the pace car for the Tour de Sol this year.&nbsp; 
Although it is not competing, it travels on all the same legs as the 
entrants.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> The drive system in this car is unusual in that it can fairly be called 
both series and parallel at the same time.&nbsp; The 4 cylinder engine is 
coupled through a clever planetary gear system to both a generator and the 
front wheels.&nbsp; And a separate electric motor also connects to the front 
wheels.&nbsp; The result is that the gasoline engine can drive the wheels 
and/or the generator at the same time that the electric motor is driving the 
wheels.&nbsp; A computer controls all of it.&nbsp; The result is that the 
engine is in one of two modes: running at near-peak torque or off.&nbsp; Toyota 
claims it gets 66 miles per gallon.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> The Nickel Metal Hydride battery pack is much smaller than in a pure 
electric.&nbsp; It has 40 blocks, each made of stacks of six D-cells, placed 
behind the back seat.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> The `Prius' threw down the gauntlet to all of those who said hybrid 
electric vehicles would not work.&nbsp; It is on sale to the general public in 
Japan, for an admittedly money-loosing price of under $18,000.&nbsp; I was able 
to drive one in December and I can tell you it operates very much the way I 
think an electric car should; quiet and smooth, without &quot;shift 
points&quot; in the driving.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> So, as I walked past the `Prius' on display in Manhattan I wondered, out 
loud, when I could get one? Jeremy Barnes of Toyota Motor Sales had an 
answer.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> &quot;We will have a hybrid powered vehicle on sale in United States prior 
to the turn of the century.&nbsp; Whether it will be the `Prius' or some other 
body style is yet to be decided, but it will be a hybrid powered vehicle.&nbsp;
</p> 
<p> &quot;The `Prius' you see here is a purpose-built vehicle for the Toyota 
Hybrid System.&nbsp; The way everything is packaged under the hood is 
specifically for the Japan market, and that's one of the reasons there will be 
a delay.&quot;</p> 
<p> At the beginning of May the production rate was raised from 1000 to 2000 
units per month.&nbsp; That still puts them about three months behind on 
delivery.&nbsp; &quot;When the vehicle went on sale in December, we were hoping 
to sell 1000 per month.&nbsp; We had 3500 orders the first day and we have been 
behind ever since.&nbsp; The big three have purchased a number of them.&nbsp; 
They are interested and/or concerned, your choice.&quot;</p> 
<p> I pointed out that Toyota was taking a bath selling the `Prius'.&nbsp; 
Each one costs about twice what they are selling it for.&nbsp; How long can 
they bleed like that?</p> 
<p> &quot;Your term is bleeding.&nbsp; Our term is seeding the market.&nbsp; 
It's an investment in the technology and an investment in the future.&quot; 
Since Toyota is the 3rd largest car manufacturer in the world, it was able to 
afford the in-house development program and then to sell the result at a price 
consumers can afford.&nbsp;</p>

<p> As we have been traveling along the route, the `Prius' is attracting a lot 
of attention.&nbsp; After it finishes each leg, it often goes out giving 
demonstration rides.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p> </p> 
<h2>Report #30: Demonstration Vehicle - `Toyota RAV4-EV'</h2> 
<p> The last time we started the NESEA Tour in New York City, 1996, there was 
a RAV4-EV on display here.&nbsp; Then, in the 1997 American Tour de Sol, Toyota 
entered a one in the Production Category.&nbsp; This year they have two serving 
as demonstration vehicles, and a gasoline RAV-4 running as a comparison 
vehicle.&nbsp; Since both the electric and gasoline versions both are traveling 
the same routes, in the same (lousy) weather, NESEA will be able to do 
apple-to-apple comparisons of engine vs. electric energy efficiency.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> (NESEA is also comparing a Geo Metro to a Solectria Force, and a Penski 
panel van to a Solectria CitiVan.)</p> 
<p> Is the vehicle being shipped today markedly different from what we saw in 
1996? According to Jeremy Barnes of Toyota Motor Sales, &quot;It has two more 
(passenger) doors.&nbsp; The development has been more in 
ease-of-operation.&quot;</p> 
<p> They have delivered about 165 vehicles in California, Georgia, 
Massachusetts, and New York, with lease commitments for about that many 
more.&nbsp; They are being built at the rate of 1.5 vehicles per day in Japan 
and then shipped to the US.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> When will the RAV4-EV be sold outside the fleet market? &quot;About a year 
or so from now is realistic.&nbsp; But don't hold your breath.&nbsp; A lot will 
depend on the outcome of the mandates in New York and California.&nbsp; We will 
put it on sale when we think the product is ready and when we think the 
consumer is ready for the product.&nbsp; We don't think either of those are 
right now.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> &quot;There are a lot of drawbacks to battery power.&nbsp; The cost, and 
the battery life which we still don't know.&nbsp; We expect ours to last about 
5 years, maybe less, maybe more.&quot;</p> 
<p> And of course pure EVs have advantages in terms of cleanliness, quiet, and 
high torque at start.&nbsp; So they are perfect for some uses, but not perfect 
for lots of uses.&nbsp; Jeremy believes there is going to be a mix of EVs, 
hybrids like the `Prius' and traditional vehicles for some time to come.&nbsp;

Maryland.&nbsp; The event is a timed run around a parking lot set up with 
traffic cones.&nbsp; This year's course included a tight 540 degree left-hand

<h2>Report #34: Purring into Washington DC</h2> 
<p> With the sun bright over head, the 10th NESEA American Tour de Sol arrived 
a bit before noon today, Thursday May 14, 1998, into downtown Washington 
DC.&nbsp; About 40 electric and hybrid electric vehicles (EVs) were displayed 
on Pennsylvania Avenue between 3rd and 4th Streets, NW.&nbsp; The bicycles, 
tricycles, cars, trucks and vans represented everything from corporate 
demonstration vehicles, through current commercial offerings, to school and 
private projects.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> Energy Secretary Federico Pen~a addressed the crowd, and especially 
&quot;the young people who ... are going to be the designers, builders and 
drivers of these vehicles.&nbsp; You are the ones who will be putting America 
firmly on the road to a cleaner environment, a stronger economy and a new edge 
in the global marketplace.&quot;</p> 
<p> Next Georgia Congressman Micheal &quot;Mac&quot; Collins announced the 
introduction of the Electric Vehicle Consumer Incentive Tax Act of 1998.&nbsp; 
The bill, introduced today in Congress, removes restrictions that formerly made 
it impossible for state and local governments to use tax credits to expand 
their electric transit and fleet vehicles.&nbsp; The bill amends the nation's 
tax laws to make a $4000 tax credit available for the purchase of EVs.&nbsp; It 
also makes large electric trucks, vans and buses eligible for $50,000 clean 
fuel vehicle tax deductions.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> After these announcements, Dr.&nbsp; Rob Wills, Technical Director and 
co-founder of the American Tour de Sol, announced prizes in each of the rally's 
categories.&nbsp; Before he did so, he pointed out that even on this sunny day, 
the sky around the capital dome behind him was not blue, it was gray.&nbsp; The 
reason it was gray, he said, was the photoactive chemicals that come from car 
exhaust.&nbsp; He predicted that over the next ten years, as we drive more and 
more electric cars, the sky will get more and more blue.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> Then he and Secretary Pen~a distributed the silver trophies to: </p>

<h2>Report #35: The Rally is Over - The Reports Continue</h2> 
<p> The 1998 NESEA American Tour de Sol United States Electric Vehicle 
Championship concludes this afternoon, Friday May 15th, with an awards ceremony 
at the Crystal City Marriott, near Washington DC.&nbsp; Your Humble Reporter 
(YHR) will be the Master of Ceremonies (MC) and will have a Report listing the 
awards as soon as I can after I return home, probably sometime on Saturday 
(RltaasaIcaIrh,psoS).&nbsp;</p> 
<p> But the Reports will continue for the next couple of weeks.&nbsp; I have 
at least 3 more hours of taped interviews, and it takes 2 hours to reduce each 
hour to these Reports.&nbsp; So stay tuned as the adventure continues.&nbsp;</p>
<p> </p> 
<p> </p> 
<h2>Report #36: Final Results Are Delayed</h2> 
<p> There was some confusion about the final scoring in the Production 
Category in the American Tour de Sol, and I missed some of the details.&nbsp; 
To ensure that I have it right, I am delaying my posting the results until 
NESEA has had a chance to review them.&nbsp; As things stand now, that will 
probably happen Monday or Tuesday.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p> </p> 
<h2>Report #37: Team Profile - `Comuta-Car'</h2> 
<p> We have two classic electric cars from more than 20 years ago here.&nbsp; 
The Zzipper (correct spelling) which is the basis of the `Solar Tiger II' and a 
`Comuta-Car', here from the Hudson Valley Community College (HVCC) in Troy 
NY.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> The Comuta-Car was originally produced in the late 1970s and early '80s, 
as a response to the oil crisis.&nbsp; The first version was the CitiCar, and a 
later, more refined version was known as the Comuta-Car.&nbsp; Both could be 
described as 2 passenger, golf-cart like vehicles, but fully enclosed and with 
bumpers.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> The HVCC `Comuta-Car' entry was built in 1981 and was still owned by Ken 
Goewey, Sr, advisor to the team, who had been a dealer.&nbsp; Because it was 
garaged, the frame and body was actually in pretty good shape when they got it 
about 2 months ago.&nbsp; It still had the 3 sets of contacts that put the 
batteries in parallel or series, changing the voltage and thus the speed.&nbsp; 
They removed that, and installed a Curtis controller, an Advanced DC motor, and 
72 Volts worth of batteries.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> The team is all seniors at the school, in the Automotives program, and 
this vehicle is a senior project.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> After the NESEA Tour, it will be used in the Alternative Fuels course at 
HVCC.&nbsp; As Mr.&nbsp; Goewey said, &quot;It's all right to mandate 2 percent 
of sales, but someone has to service these vehicles.&nbsp; They have to know 
what their doing.&nbsp; The average trainee is very proficient with gasoline 
powered vehicles, but don't have any knowledge of electrical power.&nbsp; The 
purpose is to get them interested in electrically powered vehicles.&quot;</p>

<h2>Report #38: Team Profile - `Porche 914 Electric Bull'</h2> 
<p> Another car we saw two years ago is the Porche 914, converted by a high 
school team, known as the `Electric Bull'.&nbsp; Last time it was a deep blue 
color.&nbsp; This year it's yellow and purple.&nbsp; Under the hood and in the 
trunk, everything is inclosed in boxes painted black-with-white-speckles.&nbsp; 
It looks like someone threw a cherry bomb in a can of white paint.&nbsp; I 
asked Tony Esposito to describe the car and what else is new and 
different.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> The brushed DC motor is bolted to the original 5-speed transmission in the 
rear.&nbsp; 20 6-Volt batteries power a Curtis controller.&nbsp; &quot;We redid 
the interior, put this jazzy paint job on it and drive it around every 
day.&nbsp; The mission of the car is to see how far we can go and show the 
American man that we can use electric vehicles in every-day driving.&nbsp; You 
get an electric vehicle that can go 90 miles, and the average person does 30-40 
miles per day.&nbsp; Why can't we show people and open their eyes and help the 
world.&nbsp; We only have this world once.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> &quot;This is our rally car.&nbsp; We do 5 or 6 electric races a year, a 
couple of races in California, and then the Tour de Sol every-other-year.&nbsp; 
Mainly it is driven by our leader, Michael Golden.&nbsp; He drives it to work 
and school and shopping.&quot;</p>

<h2>Report #39: Team Profile - `Hopper EV'</h2> 
<p> Each of the 6 years that I have been to the American Tour de Sol, there 
has been a `Hopper EV' and it has never been the same twice.&nbsp; In 1996 and 
'97 it was a hybrid, with a trailer carrying a diesel generator.&nbsp; In 1996 
it was burning soybean oil, aka &quot;biodiesel&quot; and the exhaust smelled 
like French fries.&nbsp; In 1997 it was burning straight petroleum diesel.&nbsp;
</p> 
<p> This year #94 it returns, but the generator set is burning so-called M85, 
85 percent methanol and 15 percent gasoline (to ease starting), and the new, 
much, much lighter (about 100 pound) generator set is mounted on what I will 
describe as a &quot;bumper mount&quot; on the rear.&nbsp; It is still removable 
with 4 bolts, so the car can run pure-electric, but when configured as a 
hybrid, there is no trailer to manage.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> But Tom Hopper was unable to continue his record as the only NESEA Tour 
vehicle to from home, to the start, through the race, and back home 
again.&nbsp; He tried, but &quot;the engine is underpowered.&nbsp; We did a 
load test and got it up to 8 horsepower (hp) at 8000 rpm, but I interprolated 
and thought that at 5000 rpm I would have about 5 hp.&nbsp; Well, I got 3, so I 
go into deficit very quickly, pushing out 15 Amps, tops and that's not enough 
to keep going.&quot; Does he expect to have trouble? &quot;I'm going to be 
limping in each day.&nbsp; I'll driving very conservatively and see if I can be 
efficient.&quot; This is quite a change from two years ago when the race rules 
penalized those that drove faster than the speed limit.&nbsp; Tom 
&quot;protested&quot; by just driving with traffic and coming in well ahead of 
the others.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> Last year, Tom widened `Hopper EV', changing it from one passenger to two, 
but he was not happy with the appearance, nor the size of the rear 
window.&nbsp; &quot;I wanted to get back to the tear-drop look I had 
originally.&quot; So he cut up the body, again, and reworked it closer to his 
satisfaction.&nbsp; &quot;I've now got more headroom, a shape I like, and a 
rear window I can see out of.&quot; The tail lights are also new, taken off a 
Saturn.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> He has also replaced the toothed-belt drive and put in a direct-drive 
gearbox, which he expects will be much more rugged.&nbsp; He also replaced the 
Optima Yellow Top batteries last year, which did not do at all well, with Deka 
Dominators, but only 3 kiloWatt-hours worth.&nbsp; That's enough for his pure 
electric commuting at home, but not nearly enough to make the long runs needed 
in the rally without enough generator capacity.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Report #40: Demonstration Vehicle - `Lectra'</h2> 
<p> Larry Dussault of the GLobal Elecric Auto Association (GLEAA) is coming on 
the entire tour demonstrating the `Lectra' VR24 motor bike, manufactured by 
Electric Motor Bike (EMB) of Sebastopol CA.&nbsp; At first glance, it looks 
like a motor cycle, until you realize that it does not have a kick start, nor a 
shift lever near your toe.&nbsp; But it does have a twist throttle on the right 
handle, so, &quot;give it a twist and before you know it your doing 40 miles 
per hour.&quot; It is sized between a scooter and a motorcycle with a 52 inch 
wheel base, weighs 340 pounds, and has a range of about 30 miles.&nbsp; 
Performance is quoted as 0-30 in 5 seconds, and a top speed of 45 mph.&nbsp;</p>
<p> The motor is a 2-phase, air cooled, variable reluctance type, described as 
compact, highly efficient and brushless.&nbsp; A 5-to-1 helical gear set 
reduces the motor speed to the chain drive.&nbsp; The controller for the motor 
is EMB's own design with a variety of safety interlock controls.&nbsp; It also 
incorporates regenerative braking with anti-lock features.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> The battery is wired in two 24 Volt, parallel strings of sealed valve 
regulated lead-acid blocks designed for more than 9000 miles with proper 
care.&nbsp; The charger is able to plug into almost any outlet; 90-264 Volts 
AC, 47-63 Hertz.&nbsp; Recharge time is 4.25 hours, or 1.5 hours with a Super 
Fast Charger.&nbsp; A 5-light display shows the state of charge.&nbsp; If it 
gets very low on energy, a &quot;reserve fuel mode&quot; can be used to get to 
the next outlet.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> The drive and battery systems are sealed against the weather and dirt, and 
maintenance is described as &quot;ultra low&quot;.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Report #41: Team Profile - `Maryland's Saturn HEV'</h2> 
<p> Sporting a colorful red-and-yellow paint job is #22, which according to 
the registration papers has a pretty mundane name.&nbsp; But Greg Magno 
confirmed that it's called &quot;The Maryland Saturn HEV&quot;.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> The 4-door sedan is now a parallel drive hybrid, with Nickel Cadmium 
batteries in the trunk, and a 1 liter, 3 cylinder, fuel injected engine and 20 
horsepower electric motor in the front.&nbsp; &quot;The electric motor assists 
the engine.&nbsp; When the engine is not working as hard as it could, we use 
the motor (as a generator) to feed energy back into the batteries.&nbsp; We get 
EPA fuel efficiency ratings of approximately 70 miles per gallon on the 
highway, 43 in the city; substantial improvements over the original car.&nbsp;
</p> 
<p> &quot;The engine feeds into a Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT) 
from Suburu.&nbsp; The motor connects with a belt to an overrunning clutch so 
we can cut the engine off and just run on pure electric.&quot; If the engine is 
running faster, then it feeds torque into the transmission.&nbsp; Otherwise, 
with engine idling or off, the electric motor take over.&nbsp; &quot;Because 
the transmission has no discrete gears, it is more efficient.&nbsp; The whole 
car is drive-by-wire.&nbsp; The computer controls the engine and motor 
automatically.&nbsp; It looks at look-up tables about 10 times a second, 
decides if the engine is loafing or needs help.&nbsp; We then use the motor to 
either regen or assist.&nbsp; The engine thus runs at a constant power level 
where it runs most efficiently.&quot; The driver sees the car as an automatic, 
without obvious shift points, which is the beauty of CVTs.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> The car has been rebuilt a number of times.&nbsp; In 1993 they gutted and 
rebuilt it for the Department of Energy's 1994 HEV Challenge.&nbsp; It was then 
torn apart and rebuilt again for the summer of 1995.&nbsp; And since then it 
has been a research vehicle, seeing a substantial amount of modification.&nbsp; 
It has seen about 3000 miles as a hybrid.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> &quot;The top speed is 105 miles per hour.&nbsp; No, I was not in the car 
when that was performed.&quot;</p>

<h2>Report #42: Team Profile - `TU ParaDyne'</h2> 
<p> The `Tu ParaDyne' is a parallel hybrid built into a Geo Metro Hatchback, 
where they have managed to keep the rear seat.&nbsp; Matt Norris described the 
car they brought from Oklahoma.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> &quot;It can operate with just the internal combustion engine, or just the 
electric motor, or we can combine them.&nbsp; They are coupled with a belt 
housing and an overrunning clutch.&quot; The engine and transmission are the 
originals for the Geo Metro.&nbsp; &quot;We kept them because they get 57 miles 
per gallon, which is the most fuel efficient production engine that we've been 
able to find.&nbsp; By coupling it with some EV technology, we can produce a 
very efficient car.&nbsp; We've had to take the whole power train out of the 
car 5 times during the past semester, but we think we finally have the 
overrunning clutch working and working efficiently.&quot; The engine and motor 
and a few batteries pretty much fill up under the hood, so the motor controller 
is in the back, along with the rest of the batteries.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> &quot;Right now, all the systems are under driver control.&quot; The 
driver accelerates electrically from zero to 30, and then use the internal 
combustion engine at the higher speeds.&nbsp; &quot;The electric motor is very 
good at low speeds, and the engine gets more efficient at the higher 
speeds.&quot;</p> 
<p> The vehicle has been together about a year and a half, and has about 300 
miles of road testing on it.&nbsp; Its been to several shows and Society of 
Automotive Engineers conferences.&nbsp; &quot;But this is the vehicle's first 
major competition.&quot;</p>

<h2>Report #43: Team Profile - `Sol Survivor IV'</h2> 
<p> `Sol Survivor IV' returns for its third appearance in the NESEA Tour, and 
what an appearance.&nbsp; Bright, bright yellow, this car has no angles; just 
sweeping curves.&nbsp; The solar panel wing integrates neatly on the back of 
the car, as do the rear wheel farings.&nbsp; The passenger sits directly behind 
the driver, and both enter the vehicle on the right through a gull-wing 
door.&nbsp; This is a very refined ground-up vehicle, built by a high school 
team with a history of building refined vehicles.&nbsp; Brian Perry and Corey 
Bangs spoke with me.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> The club that built the previous Sol Survivors used to be associated with 
the Conval High School, but now it's a private club of high schoolers and 
adults, organized by Paul Waterman.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> Since last year, the car has acquired new batteries.&nbsp; &quot;They are 
liquid acid this year.&nbsp; Last year we used gelled packs, but they didn't 
really hold up,&quot;</p> 
<p> They have replaced the terminal strips in the passenger compartment, that 
let them measure battery voltage with a hand-held meter, with a fully installed 
meter and arrangement system that lets them see the individual battery block 
voltages quickly and easily, just by twisting a knob.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> The motor has a switch mounted on it that can select between the wye and 
delta windings.&nbsp; One gives better power, the other better speed.&nbsp; It 
is not accessible when the car is underway, but the switch can be changed to 
adjust between hilly and flat terrain.&nbsp; They tend to run the car in the 
speed setting.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> Last June, this car climbed Mount Washington, in a little over 20 
minutes.&nbsp; The fact that it has regenerative braking, makes the trip down 
the mountain much less of an adventure than it is for ordinary cars, whose 
brakes get quite hot.&nbsp; &quot;Coming down, I didn't use the foot brake at 
all, just regen.&quot;</p> 
<p> In addition to visiting schools, the car goes to many events raising funds 
to support their racing activities.&nbsp; It also visits the sponsors 
often.&nbsp; &quot;We try to give back to them.&quot;</p>

<p> We last saw `Spyder Juice', the bright yellow, low sports car racer at the 
NESEA Tour in 1996.&nbsp; I asked Al Simpler, the driver, what is different 
since then.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> &quot;We changed the battery pack from the GNB G1 to the G2.&nbsp; The 
suspension has been beefed up since we have been autocrossing it.&nbsp; 
Different wheels, different tires, different gauges, just lots of little 
things.&quot;</p> 
<p> They like to race this street-legal car whenever they can.&nbsp; 
&quot;It's last race was the 6th annual SunDay Challenge (in Florida) where it 
won the Commuter category for the 3rd year in a row.&quot; The SunDay Challenge 
uses the same rules and regulations as the Tour de Sol, and this time went from 
Cocoa Beach to Disney World, where they displayed at the EPCOT Center for three 
days.&nbsp; The entrants included a fuel-cell powered John Deere Tractor, and a 
vehicle burning hydrogen.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> &quot;We are going to try to break that 1995 distance record, which is 143 
miles for lead-acid, held by Bolton High School.&quot; They are also looking to

<h2>Report #45: Interview - Rob Wills, Technical Director</h2> 
<p> Dr.&nbsp; Rob Wills founded the American Tour de Sol in 1989, and has 
served as its Technical Director ever since.&nbsp; In real life he designs 
solar electric systems.&nbsp; He became interested in the original Swiss Tours 
de Sol in the late 1980s.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> The American Tour &quot;started with four solar cars, and when I reflect 
back on the differences, they are astounding.&nbsp; I think the level of 
technical excitement is the same or a little more now.&quot;</p> 
<p> So what does Rob see when he looks back 10 years? </p> 
<p> &quot;When I think about the vehicles in that first race, the winner and 
clearly most technically elegant was `Solectria 5' which was an open-wheel 
solar racing car.&nbsp; There was also Dartmouth's `Sunvox' and New Hampshire 
Tech's vehicle.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> &quot;The fourth one (whose team I don't remember) was constructed from a 
plastic paddle boat as its core frame, and the rest was made out of plastic 
plumbing pipe.&nbsp; It was a little rough on the control side, with maybe two 
speed steps.&nbsp; It had a habit, when going over the start line, of doing a 
little wheel stand, which pleased the crowd.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> &quot;It also didn't have enough power, and had difficulty making the 30 
mile legs that we had in those days.&nbsp; It kept coming in about 5 hours 
late.&nbsp; We got so tired of waiting around for them that on the last day we 
let them start early.&nbsp; So, would you believe it, they actually made it 
without breaking down or stopping.&nbsp; Because we let start an hour early 
they came over the line at MIT first.&nbsp; Standing there was a New York Times 
reporter, who interviewed them and then left.&nbsp; So as far as the Times was 
concerned, the first American Tour de Sol was won by a plastic paddle 
boat!&quot;</p> 
<p> Another story from that time involves New Hampshire Tech.&nbsp; &quot;The 
ran their first car for quite a while before they got their solar array.&nbsp; 
They had taken a run from Concord NH, up the side of the Merrimack Valley, to 
Canterbury and back, and done quite well.&nbsp; When they put their solar array 
on they tried it again and found that their range was less with the array than 
without.&nbsp; You might think it was because of the (added aerodynamic) drag 
(of the array panel).&nbsp; But it was because they had wired the array in 
backwards and it was discharging the batteries.&quot;</p> 
<p> The whole point of the race back then was to do it all on solar 
power.&nbsp; You were heavily penalized for having to charge.&nbsp; That wasn't 
as severe as the original Swiss rules.&nbsp; &quot;If you didn't make it on 
solar power alone you got what was known as the Black Spot, and you were out of 
the race.&quot;</p> 
<p> Things certainly have changed from then to now.&nbsp; </p> 
<p> &quot;This year there are a few vehicles that jump out and I find 
extremely exciting.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> &quot;The top of the list has to be the tricycle with the fuel cell 
(`Project e- 2').&nbsp; I've been wanting the fuel cell for the last seven 
years and we have to thank Mt Everett, a high school team, for coming through 
with that.&nbsp; Not only is it a fuel cell, but it is also hydride storage, 
neatly packaged, and inherently safe.&nbsp; It points to an interesting future 
for personal transportation.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> &quot;I really support things like bicycles and one-seat vehicles, am 
curious if we can solve the dilemma of the big, heavy American car sharing the 
road with what makes sense for personal transportation, which is something 
small, light, possibly strong, and very efficient.&nbsp; Maybe in time we will 
end up with light and heavy vehicle lanes.&nbsp; We might tax the heck out of 
heavy vehicles and people might migrate to one-seaters.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> &quot;Another exciting vehicle is the Toyota Prius on display.&nbsp; It is 
just a marvel of engineering, beautifully integrated, and shows that you can 
achieve the sorts of things (the American Tour de Sol) is talking about with 
current engineering inside a reasonable cost budget.&nbsp; Toyota says that if 
they get to about 200,000 production they will start to break even on it.&nbsp; 
That's not too hard to do!</p> 
<p> &quot;And the third one ...&nbsp; Well, I used to say that the (E-type?) 
Jaguar was my favorite body design, but I think I have just fallen totally for 
Mike Seal's `Viking 29', strictly on body lines, and then you have to add the 
technology.&nbsp; Thermophotovoltaics are very, very interesting.&nbsp; That's 
a practical hybrid vehicle running on (natural) gas, with very low 
emissions.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> &quot;It's always worth following all of the technologies in parallel, and 
we hope that the fuel cell can make it, but ultimately this could be a simpler 
alternative since you don't have to reform a liquid (to extract the 
hydrogen).&quot;</p> 
<p> After our interview on Saturday afternoon, Rob went back to managing the 
technical testing.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p> </p> 
<h2>Report #46: Team Profile - `Sunpacer'</h2> 
<p> The basic structure of `Sunpacer' has not changed in the five years I've 
been reporting the ATdS.&nbsp; Over the years it has gotten more refined, but 
the changes have been mostly below the surface.&nbsp; The exterior remains very 
familiar.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> #92's body is an aluminum wedge, with the thin edge at the rear.&nbsp; The 
front is rounded with a large plastic windshield that gives the driver a pretty 
commanding view of what is ahead.&nbsp; The front opens up on a hinge to let 
the driver enter.&nbsp; A large, rectangular solar panel is on top of the flat 
rear slope of the wedge.&nbsp; It has 3 wheels; the rear is the driven 
one.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> Travis Smith described the few differences from last year.&nbsp; The rear 
tire is new, as is the hydraulic rear braking system replacing the mechanical 
one that had been there.&nbsp; The front wheels brake reservoir is now larger, 
so they don't have to double-pump the front brakes in severe braking.&nbsp;</p>

has 2 Hondas and 12 `Toyota RAV4-EVs' in the state.&nbsp; NYPA is also 
co-funding the lease of 35 RAV4-EVs for the city's fleet.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> The `EV Plus' is a two door, four seat car that sits very high, because 
the batteries are under the seats.&nbsp; It is front wheel drive, with the 
motor and liquid-cooled Electronic Power Control System also up front.&nbsp; I 
drove the `EV Plus' last December, and the designers have gone a long way to 
make the experience very much like an automatic transmission car.&nbsp; There 
is a Start position on the key, and the car creeps forward when you take your 
foot off the brake.&nbsp; These are both attributes of gasoline vehicles that 
are preserved so people don't feel the difference.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> So what is it like living with one day-in and day-out? &quot;I would get 
one for myself if it wasn't so expensive.&nbsp; It's like a dream car.&nbsp; 
It's very comfortable, very responsive, it accelerates beautifully and has very 
good braking.&nbsp; It is very stable.&nbsp; I love it.&nbsp; I love the way it 
drives, the quietness, and its cleanness.&quot;</p> 
<p> Ms.&nbsp; King made the point that she hoped that pure-electrics would 
always have a place in the future.&nbsp; There are some that believe that, to 
get the long range, engine-dominated electric drive trains will displace the 
vehicles that plug in.&nbsp; She hoped that would not be the case because the 
much lower pollution and the much quieter operation were very important to 
her.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Report #48: Interview - Nancy Hazard, ATdS Director</h2> 
<p> Nancy told me that the Swiss and American Tours de Sol were both started 
by people interested in promoting the idea of solar energy, not for cars, but 
for buildings.&nbsp; But buildings don't generate any excitement, and they 
don't move.&nbsp; So the idea of having racing cars run on sunlight was not to 
suggest that it would ever really work for transportation, but to promote solar 
as a sustainable, and potentially commercial, energy source.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> &quot;When, in 1990, the Clean Air Act was passed the Californians decided 
that the only way they could meet those requirements was to have zero emission 
vehicles.&nbsp; When they said that out loud, and we at NESEA heard that, our 
brains started churning.&nbsp; The Tour de Sol demonstrates the idea of using 
solar energy, but unless hundreds of thousands of people use these things, 
there will be no impact and they will remain just toys.&nbsp; To make a 
difference you have to have electric vehicles that are practical for everyday 
use.&nbsp; That changed the mission of the NESEA Tour completely after that 
first year.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> &quot;Some of our NESEA members were really angry at that switch in 
philosophy, thinking that NESEA had sold out.&quot; The perception was that 
promoting electric vehicles was playing into the hands of the nuclear power 
industry and big industry, and giving up on the purity of the sustainable 
energy message.&nbsp; &quot;For a number of years, it was very difficult for us 
to make the point that there was a connection between electric vehicles and 
renewable energy.&nbsp; We do a much better job of that now, but in fact I 
still think there is a long way to go.&quot;</p> 
<p> &quot;We struggle a lot at the NESEA Tour to do real-world data 
collection.&nbsp; Our message to the public today is that electric vehicles are 
much more efficient, especially in the urban environment.&nbsp; This year we 
have four gasoline-to- electric comparisons.&nbsp; We have the `Honda EV Plus' 
and a Honda, and the Geo Metro and two `Solectria Forces', one lead-acid, one 
nickel metal hydride.&nbsp; We also have a gasoline Toyota RAV-4 and a 
`RAV4-EV'.&nbsp; And we have the `Solectria CitiVan' which we'll be comparing 
to a Penski truck.&nbsp; These numbers will be added to the spreadsheet that 
Argonne National Labs is developing, and from that we will be able to see the 
amount of greenhouse gas production avoided by using EVs, plus the amount of 
fossil fuel consumption avoided, and the amount of petroleum consumption 
avoided by using electrics.&quot;</p> 
<p> And the presence of the very refined vehicles made by Solectria, Toyota, 
Honda, Chrysler, and Ford here at the rally shows that electrics can be 
satisfying to own and drive.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> The NESEA Tour is indeed &quot;Celebrating 10 Years of Progress.&quot; </p>

<h2>Report #51: Technical Testing Scores</h2> 
<p> Here are the results of the technical testing, mostly performed on 
Saturday, May 9th.&nbsp; The scores are in Tour Miles (TM), with maximum listed 
at the top of most columns.&nbsp; Unlike in past years, these evaluation scores 
were added into the team scores.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> The Production Category vehicles are not included here.&nbsp; They had 
their own scoring, which will be in the next Report.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> The Cone Test is a classic maneuverability test around traffic cones.&nbsp;
</p> 
<p> The Standing Start 50 feet test is an acceleration test, aimed at ensuring 
safety in traffic.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> The Standing Start Quarter Mile is more like a drag race against the 
clock.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> The Hill Start test is another safety check to ensure the cars can start 
up hill.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> The Practicality score is an evaluation of the vehicle's usability.&nbsp; 
</p> 
<p> The Brake Deceleration test is a safety check.&nbsp; </p> 
<p> The Engineering Elegance score is a subjective award.&nbsp; </p> 
<p> The Passing Technical Testing on the 1st Try acknowledges those teams that 
come to the event with everything in good working order.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> The Passing Ground Fault on the 1st Try acknowledges those that pass this 
critical safety test immediately.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> The Technical Specification Form Completed On Time similarly acknowledges 
early completion of documentation.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> A subjective Educational Display Board and Team Appearance award (5 Tour 
Miles) was not listed.&nbsp; I suspect the difficulties of dealing with the 
rain simply dropped this from consideration.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Report #52: Technical Testing - Production Category</h2> 
<p> For the first time this year, the Production Category Vehicles have a 
totally different scoring system from the other four Categories.&nbsp; First of 
all, the system is based on points instead of Tour Miles.&nbsp; The goal was to 
measure the Production vehicles against the standards of other production cars 
and trucks in the automotive world, rather than against each other.&nbsp; So, 
while the test data is collected in technical terms, the Final Test Score 
points are awarded according to how the technical measures compare with 
comparable internal combustion engine vehicles.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> First, here are the raw data ...&nbsp; </p> 
<p> The Slalom Test is the same as the Cone Test in the other Categories.&nbsp;
</p> 
<p> The Standing Start 50 feet acceleration test is measured as Miles Per Hour 
at the end of the run.&nbsp; It is used to calculate the Acceleration in the 
following column in feet per second-squared.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> Next is the Standing Quarter Mile acceleration test.&nbsp; </p> 
<p> The Practicality is a subjective measure.&nbsp; </p> 
<p> The Braking data is Velocity, Distance, and calculated Deceleration.&nbsp; 
</p> 
<p> The Autocross is the time through the course, in seconds, plus two points 
for each knocked over cone.&nbsp; (None of these runs had touched any cones.)
</p> 
<p> The Fuel Economy is calculated in Miles Per Gallon Equivalent of 
gasoline.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> The Range on Day 3 is the total miles driven on Tuesday, New Castle 
Delaware to Dover Delaware, plus laps.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> The Refueling OnBoard Charger Power is measured in kiloWatts.&nbsp; </p> 
<p> Vehicle Efficiency is in kiloWatt-hours per mile.&nbsp; </p> 
<p> The Miles per Hour-of-Charge score is the Onboard Charger Power divided by 
the Vehicle Efficiency.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> Quick Charge ability and Regenerative Braking each are awarded points, as 
is the ability to Charge in less than 8 hours.&nbsp;</p>

<p> Here are the criteria used to award points.&nbsp; </p> 
<p> Acceleration points are normalized against comparable ICE vehicles: </p> 
<pre> 50 foot acceleration test (0-10 points) 1/4 mile acceleration test (0-10 
points)</pre> 
<p> Braking points are normalized against comparable ICE vehicles: </p> 
<pre> Brake Pedal (0-10 points) Emergency Brake (0-10 points) </pre> 
<p> Handling points points are normalized against comparable ICE vehicles: </p>
<pre> Slalom (aka Cone) Test (0-10 points) Autocross Standing (0-10 points) 
</pre> 
<p> The Reliability score awarded 5 points per leg completed on time and 
without breakdown; 7 legs.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> Fuel economy points points are normalized against comparable ICE vehicles: 
</p> 
<pre> 10 points were awarded during the city drive in NYC, 10 during highway 
driving, 10 during secondary road driving.&nbsp;</pre> 
<p> Range is normalized against a benchmark of 225 miles per charge over a 
combination of highway and secondary roads.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> Consumer Acceptability (25 points) is a combination of measured and 
subjective scores covering:</p> 
<pre> Road Noise (meter used) Ease of Access (getting in and out) Driving 
Position (head/leg room, road visibility) Front/Rear Seat Comfort Cargo Area 
(size, utility) Climate Control System (heat, air conditioning) Safety 
Features: ABS brakes, air bags, battery acid, etc.&nbsp; Costs and checkups: 
running and maintenance Ease of charging and/or refueling Meets the mission the 
vehicle is designed for Styling Fun to Drive? Overall feeling of consumer 
acceptability</pre> 
<p> Refueling is based on: </p> 
<pre> Onboard charging ability (0-6 points) Ability to quick charge (0-4 
points) Regenerative Braking (0-4 points) Full Charge in 8 hours (0-6 points)
</pre> 
<p> Finally, the grand Total is the sum of all those scores.&nbsp; The 
Production Category Prizes were based on the Total.&nbsp; (The Total was called 
the &quot;Consumer Acceptability Prize for Production Vehicles&quot; in the 
NESEA literature.&nbsp; I find that confusing since there is a &quot;Consumer 
Acceptability&quot; score that makes up a fraction of the Total.)</p> 
<p> (The maximum Total should be 200 according to the information above, but 
the table below has a maximum of 190.&nbsp; That is because the Fuel Economy is 
listed as being a maximum of 20 points below.&nbsp; I assume that is because 
they were unable to develop one of the three Fuel sub-scores.)</p>

<h2>Report #53: Demonstration Vehicle - `Chrysler Epic'</h2> 
<p> Chrysler is displaying a number of vehicles with the NESEA Tour, including 
the electric `Epic' 4-door minivan, the Dodge `Intrepid ES X2' diesel-electric 
hybrid concept car, The `Plymouth Prowler' aluminum body roadster, the `Pronto 
Spyder' 2-door roadster concept car, and a `Composite Concept Vehicle' made 
mostly of PETE plastic (the same as used in soda bottles, Recycle Code 1), 
which makes it both affordable and ultimately recyclable.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> Anne Smith told me that the 1999 Nickel Metal Hydride `Epic' electric 
minivan will be built on the regular Windsor Ontario assembly line.&nbsp; As 
the van goes down the line, when it comes time to put in the drive train, those 
that will be getting electric simply turn off the normal line and go down a 
special electric drive assembly line.&nbsp; There the electric drive train gets 
bolted into the same mount points and uses much of the same wiring harnesses 
used by the engine powered vans.&nbsp; When finished, the van rejoins the 
regular line for finishing, and drives off.&nbsp; &quot;It takes a bit longer, 
but being at a major assembly plant you get all your gear quality benefits, 
volume production and costs benefits.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> The `Intrepid ES X2' is primarily a fuel-engined vehicle with an electric 
boost for acceleration.&nbsp; The literature claims 70 miles per gallon from a 
3-cylinder direct-injected diesel engine on a 5-speed electronically shifted 
transmission combined with a 133 pound lead-acid battery and motor (not 
described).&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Report #54: Team Profile - `Shocker III'</h2> 
<p> The high school students from North Carolina with #10B (yes, that `B' 
belongs there, and is on the car) are rightfully proud of their electric racing 
car.&nbsp; Brooks Williams told me that, &quot;the car is called `Shocker III' 
and the Team is NEAT, Northampton Electric Auto Team.&nbsp; Shocker I is a Ford 
Escort and Shocker II is a Geo Metro.&nbsp; Shocker III is also an Escort and 
has been running for two years.&quot; The car is configured for serious track 
racing, with full roll bars, deep bucket racing seat with 5 point harness, and 
clip pins on the hood and doors.&nbsp; &quot;It has been to the EV Grand Prix 
in Richmond VA, the APS Electrics in Phoenix AZ, and also the EVIC in Florida 
where we won first place.&nbsp; When we are not racing we go to the elementary 
schools in our county and tell them about it.&nbsp; We also go to the middle 
schools and try to recruit the upcoming freshmen for our programs.&nbsp; We are 
in a class that we take every day for an hour and a half.&quot; The class 
covers automotive engineering, electric wiring, and a little bit of 
everything.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Report #55: Getting the Details Right, Saturday Testing</h2> 
<p> (These notes taken under the FDR Drive on the east side of Manhattan at 
the South Street Sea Port.&nbsp; The overhead roadway provided protection from 
the nearly constant rain.&nbsp; Most of the testing was accomplished under this 
shelter.&nbsp; The exceptions, as you would expect, were the acceleration and 
braking tests performed on a stretch of blocked-off road nearby.)</p> 
<p> In theory, and in demonstrated fact, an electric car can be much simpler 
than a one with an internal combustion engine (ICE), if only because the number 
of moving parts are much, much fewer.&nbsp; But for an ICE Hybrid Electric 
Vehicle (HEV), the numbers tend to work against you.&nbsp; You have all the 
complexity of an engine, plus the lesser complexity of the electric drive, plus 
the complexity of controlling both.&nbsp; The result is there is much more to 
worry about.&nbsp; And as the NESEA Tour has matured, the safety requirements 
have gotten more stringent, also, requiring closer attention to the 
details.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> On Saturday, the Cornell team found that out going through their technical 
inspection.&nbsp; #14 `Slipstream' had essentially the same fuel system as last 
year's entry.&nbsp; But this year it was bounced.&nbsp; I spoke with Jeremy 
Kowalczyk on Saturday morning.&nbsp; &quot;A lot of our fuel system seems to be 
out of spec, so the Tour de Sol not really happy about it.&nbsp; We have to 
change a lot of fittings and tubes before they'll let us compete as an 
HEV.&nbsp; We have rubber tubes for our CNG (Compressed Natural Gas fuel) and 
they want steel-rated tubes.&nbsp; As a compromise they will let us use double 
camps and different fittings.&nbsp; Our CNG is stored at 3000 pounds per square 
inch in the tank.&nbsp; We have a bunch of regulators to bring the pressure 
down for the engine.&nbsp; These are a lot of the same fittings as we used last 
year and they didn't complain then, but they are this year.&quot;</p> 
<p> Later, Peter Kung said they had the fuel system worked out to everyone's 
satisfaction.&nbsp; Now they were working on getting their E-Meter, which 
measures energy usage from the battery to the controller and motor, to stop 
resetting every time they went into regenerative braking.&nbsp; They had the 
dashboard off, so I could see what is normally hidden.&nbsp; There were lots of 
electrical wires, but most went to terminal strips or to plugs.&nbsp; I was 
told that pulling or replacing the dashboard was relatively easy, because all 
the connections to instruments were on plugs and jacks.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> - - - - - - - - - - </p> 
<p> #37 `Solar Tiger 2', the high school team from Endicott NY, was also 
learning about getting the details right.&nbsp; On Friday, in Flushing, the 
folks from Western Washington University were helping helping them out by 
welding the top of one of their aluminum shock towers back on using a TIG 
welder.&nbsp; No sooner was that done than, while taking the car off the 
trailer, the tie rod to the steering broke.&nbsp; &quot;We were able to 
scrounge up some flat metal and get it welded on, and it seems to be running 
OK,&quot; said Scott Brazinski.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> - - - - - - - - - - </p> 
<p> Western Washington U's `Viking 23' was not without its difficulties.&nbsp; 
&quot;We've had a ground fault,&quot; said Roseanne Gile, &quot;and we're going 
through and trying to find it.&nbsp; We had some (dried) electrolyte on the 
carbon (fiber) chassis.&quot; They were cleaning and drying everything in 
sight.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p> </p> 
<h2>Report #56: Team Profile - `Solar Commuter Car'</h2> 
<p> Villanova has been listed in the programs for the last few Tour de Sols, 
but never showed up.&nbsp; In Morristown NJ, at the end of the first leg of the 
first day, Bill Lambing told me that, &quot;over the past couple of years we've 
had problems with final exams or getting the car ready.&nbsp; It was always one 
little thing.&nbsp; We would have the car 90 percent done, but that last 10 
percent would keep us from passing inspections.&quot;</p> 
<p> But finals ended last Friday and they are here, inspected and driving down 
the road.&nbsp; &quot;The first leg felt very good.&nbsp; We didn't have too 
much of a chance to charge on Saturday because we took the car home to my house 
(in Wayne NJ) and worked on it all night.&nbsp; I didn't like the $16 in tolls 
to cross the George Washington bridge, but ...&nbsp; She ran strong, 
considering they were the first real miles we put on her.&quot;</p> 
<p> #69 has a Sebring Fiberglas body, made in the early 1980s, on a VW Beetle 
chassis, painted white.&nbsp; The top over the driver and passenger are on a 
hinge mechanism that lifts up and forward for getting in and out.&nbsp; Solar 
cells totaling 500 Watts cover most of the horizontal surfaces, on the hood, 
roof, trunk, down the roof pillars either side of the windshield, and even on 
top of the rally light bar above the windshield.&nbsp; The 96 Volts of battery 
drive a brushless DC motor.&nbsp; &quot;We went through 5 inches of water today 
and didn't have a problem.&quot; The big Lester charger is offboard, &quot;and 
just because it has handles does not mean it is portable.&quot;</p> 
<p> &quot;Villanova has had the car for about seven years now.&nbsp; The car 
belongs to a club of mechanical and electrical engineers who have free time on 
their hands once in a while.&nbsp; We get some funding from the College of 
Engineering, plus we beg and borrow from local companies for funding and 
parts.&nbsp; It is used in local parades and publicity events around 
campus.&quot;</p>

<h2>Report #57: Team Profile - `Mach .1'</h2> 
<p> Three years ago, a cyclist named Mhyee (pronounced &quot;Me&quot;) was at 
the NESEA Tour on an electrically-assisted bike.&nbsp; Is he a professional 
cyclist? &quot;If you have to get paid to do this, then no.&nbsp; But if it is 
all you do, then yes.&quot; His mission is to promote sustainable 
transportation with a human-power component.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> He is back again, this time on a pair of vehicles.&nbsp; The Judges have 
allowed him to switch off between them during the rally.&nbsp; One is a 
two-wheeled bike with a thin faring that makes it look like a vertical 
wing.&nbsp; The rear of the faring has flexible solar panels on either side, 
which certainly have not generated much energy in all this rain.&nbsp; This is 
Mhyee's own bike, and he'll get to keep it after the event.&nbsp; &quot;Other 
teams have vehicles that demonstrate getting their controller, motor, or 
battery across the finish line.&nbsp; To me the whole idea is to get the human 
body across the finish line.&nbsp; And if it is sitting the chair, it might as 
well be pedaling.&quot; The chair is made of a webbed material, mounted low 
between the wheels, supported with shock cords and with a lumbar curve in the 
back.&nbsp; &quot;Very comfortable.&quot;</p> 
<p> The bike has two derailers and a hub transmission between the pedal crank 
up front and the rear wheel.&nbsp; &quot;It has 105 speeds.&nbsp; In front is a 
triple crank, just like a mountain bike.&nbsp; In the middle is a 5-speed 
cassette.&nbsp; And the rear is a 7-speed internal hub.&quot; The electric 
system adds about 50 pounds, so it better do something to make it worth all 
that weight.&nbsp; It has 14 pounds of nickel metal hydride batteries.&nbsp; 
The motor is below the seat.&nbsp; It is tied into the last drive train and 
thus adds to the human power driving the rear wheel.&nbsp; &quot;It adds about 
another human's effort while your pedaling along for a couple of hours.&quot;
</p> 
<p> The motor, which is another point of entering the vehicle in the NESEA 
Tour, is a &quot;Smart Wheels&quot; brushless DC, pancake motor, weighing about 
8 pounds.&nbsp; The design uses 8 pole, 3 phase windings, ceramic permanent 
magnets, and ball bearings on all shafts.&nbsp; Jim Dunn, with the Center for 
Technology Commercialization that cosponsored the `Mach .1' entry, later showed 
me how the controller was built into the motor.&nbsp; In its bicycle form, the 
motor replaces the hub, taking the wheel spokes.&nbsp; Two pairs of wires come 
from the center of the axle shaft.&nbsp; One pair goes to the batteries and the 
other goes to the throttle, thus the wiring is about as simple as you can 
get.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> The other vehicle Mhyee is riding is a two-in-front/one-in-the-rear 
tricycle.&nbsp; This one also uses the Smart Wheels motor, on the rear wheel, 
but is without farings or aerodynamic enhancement.&nbsp; Mhyee rode the trike 
over several legs of the race, but I never got around to getting the 
details.&nbsp; (I suspect the bicycle with faring was very difficult to handle 
during the rain storms, especially given some of the winds we have seen.&nbsp; 
The trike is much more stable, although it offers no protection from the 
elements.)</p>

<h2>Report #58: Team Profile - `Ovonic Electric Scooter'</h2> 
<p> On Monday morning Ben Ovshinsky was standing by #3, a very small motor 
scooter, reminiscent of a baby Vespa.&nbsp; &quot;It has less than 3 
kiloWatt-hours of energy on board, which will carry it about 100 miles on one 
charge.&nbsp; It actually has better top speed, acceleration and power than the 
conventional internal combustion engine it replaced.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> &quot;The scooter itself is from Taiwan, where this is a very popular mode 
of transport.&nbsp; We have seen a family of seven on a somewhat larger 
scooter.&nbsp; There is a tremendous pollution and noise problem with 
two-stroke engines in the East.&nbsp; This is really the solution.&nbsp; Just a 
nominal amount of electricity and you can go a hundred miles.&quot;</p> 
<p> There is a Continuously Variable Transmission between the motor and the 
toothed rubber belt that drives the rear wheel.&nbsp; With the tremendous 
torque of the electric motor it easily out performs the conventional scooter it 
replaces.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> &quot;Ovonic has partnerships with Formosa Plastic and Walson in Taiwan, 
focused on two- and three-wheeled vehicles.&nbsp; We also have a partnership in 
Italy with Piaggio (sp?) who make the Vespa.&nbsp; In the USA the two-wheeled 
vehicle is a recreational and novelty item, but in the rest of the world it's 
essential transportation.&quot;</p>

<p> Whenever I catch someone from an advanced battery company, I try to get 
their sense of when the production levels will get high enough so the 
production costs can get low enough to make the batteries affordable to the 
general public.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> Ben said, &quot;that volume is pretty nominal.&nbsp; It's about 20,000 to 
30,000 units per year.&nbsp; Obviously, there is not that kind of demand this 
year.&nbsp; We have increased production an order of magnitude over this past 
year.&nbsp; GM-Ovonic is now capable of making 300 or 400 packs (suitable for 
an EV1 electric car, about 30 kiloWatt-hours) per year.&nbsp; And soon, within 
months, we'll open the doors on another order-of-magnitude increase.&nbsp; In a 
year or so, the price will come down even further.&quot;</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p> </p> 
<h2>Report #59: Team Profile - `NFA Sol Machine'</h2> 
<p> Last year, #58 rallied in the One Person Category, but this year they have 
switched to the Solar Commuter Category.&nbsp; To do this, they had to add a 
second seat.&nbsp; After all, a commuter car, even a solar commuter car, must 
be able to car pool, according to the NESEA rules.&nbsp; The second person sits 
behind and considerably higher than the driver.&nbsp; They had to remove two 
sections of solar panel so the passenger can get out of the car within the 
15-second rule.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> In addition to the extra seat, the welding class built an extension frame 
that moved the rear wheel swing arm further to the rear.&nbsp; &quot;We changed 
from a chain driver to a belt drive and put disk brakes on.&nbsp; It was 
supposed to really help us but the new rear wheel is hurting our efficiency a 
little bit because it's more efficient at high speeds than we normally run the 
car.&quot;</p> 
<p> They have 3 interchangeable strings of batteries, that can be switched by 
changing which Anderson connector is plugged into the controller.&nbsp; One is 
a string of Interstate car batteries, and the other two strings are Hawker 
motorcycle batteries.&nbsp; Since the connectors are only accessible from the 
outside of the car they have to stop to change between strings.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> The vehicle is mostly covered in transparent plastic, so the team and the 
public can see the structure, components, and wiring.&nbsp; It makes it a 
particularly good vehicle to show to the school kids that visit the Tour 
displays.&nbsp; They can relate more readily to just what the car is and the 
fact that it was built by high school students.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> Between Tour de Sols, the car &quot;parks in front of Wal-Mart and we ask 
people for money.&quot; They also do parades and competed in the last SunDay 
Challenge in Florida where they beat everyone in their category.&nbsp; They 
also are continually trying to make the car lighter and better.&nbsp;</p>

cargo planes.&nbsp; They could help us out by flying the car down there for 
us.&quot;</p>

<h2>Report #60: Team Profile - `Sungo'</h2> 
<p> I first fell in love with the `Sungo' at my first or second Tour de 
Sol.&nbsp; It is a low, two person commuter vehicle that just looks like an 
small electric commuter car should, in my opinion.&nbsp; It has always been a 
favorite with the public.&nbsp; The composite body hinges at the front, lifting 
up to let the driver and passenger get in.&nbsp; It is very short, so that two 
could fit in a single parking space, sideways.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> It has always had a separate motor for each of the rear wheels, but this 
year it turned in its toothed belts and brushless DC motors for a fixed-ratio 
gear box and an AC induction motor on each.&nbsp; A special circuit balances 
the drive signals to the motors, serving the function of a differential when 
the car turns.&nbsp; The car is also built very low to the ground, which has 
helped it do well in the Autocross events in past years.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Report #61: City Driving, Country Driving, Overnight Charging</h2> 
<p> Day 2 of the Tour de Sol started in Princeton New Jersey in a 
drizzle.&nbsp; School groups visited the display of cars outside Princeton High 
School.&nbsp; Meanwhile, I spoke with a few teams before they lined up for the 
start.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> - - - - - - - - - - </p> 
<p> The nature of the American Tour de Sol is to drive in the real world, as 
we find it.&nbsp; But the real world means different things to different 
people, as Jonita Dunn of #10b `Shocker III' found out.&nbsp; &quot;Sunday we 
got off to a slow start coming from New York City to New Jersey.&nbsp; There 
was a lot of traffic and traffic lights, which slowed us down a lot.&nbsp; It 
was terrible with people in the street, people pulling out in front of 
you.&nbsp; Yesterday afternoon going from Morristown to Princeton was real 
wet.&nbsp; I drove (that leg) and we averaged between 25 and 35 miles per hour 
through beautiful countryside, like I'm used to at home.&quot; Home is 
Northampton County North Carolina, right where Interstate 95 crosses into 
Virginia.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> Bob Clark, physics teacher and co-instructor for the Northampton Electric 
Auto Team (NEAT), said, &quot;I drove in New York because we were in the 
city.&nbsp; When I drove, I got 3.3 miles per kiloWatt hour.&nbsp; When Jonita, 
a student, drove she got 4.4 miles per kiloWatt hour.&nbsp; Driving skill has a 
lot to do with how the car performs.&quot;</p> 
<p> The `Shocker III' team were real happy when they got the datasheets 
showing their performance on Sunday.&nbsp; They tied for first place in the 
Commuter Category, at 69.4 Tour Miles, with #16 `The Olympian'.&nbsp; They were 
enthusiasticly vocal, to say the least.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> - - - - - - - - - - </p> 
<p> Monte Gisborne of #13 `The Electrifly' ran into a few problems that 
resulted in having to tow into Princeton.&nbsp; &quot;My car is the only one 
that needs three-phase electricity to charge.&nbsp; We were guaranteed 
three-phase in Morristown, but it wasn't there.&nbsp; So I McGivered a single 
phase charger, but only got about 5 Amps.&nbsp; Then we got lost by taking a 
wrong turn.&nbsp; Our chase vehicle passed us and went on to Princeton.&quot; 
By the time they found each other and got to the charging trailer, it was 11 
pm.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> - - - - - - - - - - </p> 
<p> Nina Berryman of #93 `Helios the Heron V' said they did not get a good 
charge Sunday night.&nbsp; &quot;In my opinion, it's something wrong with one 
of the connections and not the chargers, because we have really good Solectria 
chargers.&nbsp; We know we didn't get enough because we drove in with about 120 
on our E-Meter and this morning we had 126.&nbsp; A full charge would be about 
140.&quot;</p> 
<p> - - - - - - - - - - </p> 
<p> Even the people setting up the charging trailer had some 
difficulties.&nbsp; On Sunday, when the power company threw the last switch to 
activate the trailer, two of the electric phases were crossed.&nbsp; &quot;I 
was about 5 feet from the pipe where it comes down to the trailer,&quot; said 
Steve Kurkoski.&nbsp; &quot;The electrician making the connection was 
straddling the pipe.&nbsp; From 5 feet away I could feel the ground vibrate and 
hear the wires rattling in the pipe.&nbsp; That was kind of exciting.&quot; 
They had two leads for each leg of a Wye-service, and because one of the leads 
was mislabeled, they had a phase-to-phase dead-short.&nbsp; The power company 
figured out the problem, and that they had made the mistake, fixed it, and got 
the charging trailer on line.&nbsp; &quot;It didn't delay the start of 
charging, but did give us an extra hour of work to do, so we didn't get our 
usual nap between setup and start-of-charging.&quot;</p> 
<p> - - - - - - - - - - </p> 
<p> Cornell's #14 `Slipstream' came through the first day just fine, although 
they didn't get their E-meter to work.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> - - - - - - - - - - </p> 
<p> Tom Hopper was very concerned that he would not be able to coach #94 
`Hopper EV' all the way through these long legs because his methanol burning 
generator set was just not putting out enough Watts.&nbsp; But he managed to 
get all the way to Morristown, plugged in, and then got all the way to 
Princeton.&nbsp; He credited conservative driving with helping him go the 
distance.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> - - - - - - - - - - </p> 
<p> #83 `Sol Survivor IV' was not able to go under the Start banner in New 
York City on Sunday.&nbsp; &quot;We had difficulty with the rain.&nbsp; It was 
shorting out the accelerator pedal to the controller and we had no control over 
the motor.&nbsp; We dried it out last night with a hair drier and covered the 
controller and sealed it all up,&quot; said Corey Bangs.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> - - - - - - - - - - </p> 
<p> #7 `TU ParaDyne' made a wrong turn on Sunday, and wound up on the highway, 
but managed to get back onto the route.&nbsp; &quot;The drive was real 
pretty,&quot; according to Matt Norris.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> - - - - - - - - - - </p> 
<p> According to Jillian Golden, #32 `Porche 914 Electric Bull' also went a 
little astray on Sunday.&nbsp; &quot;We fixed all our little kinks, like our 
driver and navigator are going to communicate more and be sure that they know 
the route, so they don't miss the turns.&nbsp; The car is doing exactly what we 
want it to do.&quot;</p> 
<p> - - - - - - - - - - </p> 
<p> Nicole Smith told me that on Sunday #72 `Sungo' &quot;encountered a huge 
puddle, got water in the battery box and ended up with a ground fault.&quot; 
The driver got a little tingle, but was not injured.&nbsp; Sunday night they 
opened up the car, dried out the battery box and put it back together.&nbsp; 
Other than that, &quot;it's doing well when we don't take it swimming.&quot;</p>
<p> - - - - - - - - - - </p> 
<p> #76 `Ovonic Solectria Force' was parked on the grass overnight, and, in 
the rain, sank down into the mud and got stuck.&nbsp; They were able to get it 
out on Monday morning before the start.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> - - - - - - - - - - </p> 
<p> James Worden of Solectria told me that because several customers have 
upgraded their older `Force' cars to more modern, more powerful drive systems, 
the used motors and controllers being removed are going to good homes.&nbsp; 
For example, the motors and controllers in #72 `Sungo' were used, and the ones 
taken from #50 `95 Solectria/Horizon' is going to a girl's high school in 
Connecticut for their Tour de Sol entry next year.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> He also said that Solectria is now making a Watt-hour meter that can be 
plugged into their vehicles.&nbsp; There are a couple here; one is on #3 and 
the other on #50.&nbsp; &quot;You can just plug it right into the harness so 
you don't have to put another current shunt in.&quot;</p> 
<p> I asked James why the `Sunrise', Solectria's all composite car that holds 
a Tour de Sol range record, was entered this year.&nbsp; &quot;We are not 
racing it here because it is not a product yet.&nbsp; We still need a 
partner.&quot; There is some interest in New Jersey to build the Sunrise in 
that state, so they will soon have a Sunrise to promote that idea.&nbsp; 
&quot;(The Sunrise) is quite refined now, and all the tooling is ready.&nbsp; 
If we can sell 5,000 a year, then we can make money.&nbsp; 20,000 a year is 
what we really want to sell, so investors can make money.&quot;</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p> </p> 
<h2>Report #62: Team Profile - `Charger Bike'</h2> 
<p> #12, the `Charger Bike' returns again this year with its own unique take 
on the theme of human-electric hybrid vehicle.&nbsp; Unlike most electric 
bikes, this one _will not_ put any electric power to the wheel _unless_ the 
rider is also pedaling.&nbsp; It only increases the value of the human effort; 
it never substitutes electric power for muscle power.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> This year Team Charger is six guys from Branford High School, near New 
Haven Connecticut, taking turns riding the NESEA Tour.&nbsp; The Branford 
students have also built and raced an electric tricycle that was all about 
speed, rather than range, but it isn't here.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> Mike Anzel said that this Charger Bike has been modified from a stock 
version.&nbsp; It has a faring over the spokes of the rear wheel, and a motor 
geared up for higher speeds than on a standard Charger.&nbsp; &quot;The 
modification makes it so, instead of going up to 25 miles per hour, you can go 
up to 35 miles per hour.&quot; They say in dry weather the gear ratio should 
support 45 miles per hour.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> A sensor detects the human-power torque and then adds a percentage 
more.&nbsp; That percentage is selected with four buttons on the power pack 
mounted below the step-over bar between the seat and handle bars.&nbsp; A 
7-gear rear hub is controlled by the rider, and the gearing is such that the 
motor is always operating in the same gear as the rider, providing 
hill-climbing assistance in low gears and speed assistance in high gears.&nbsp; 
The single module that contains the controller, charger and battery pack is 
removable so the batteries can easily be recharged without having to bring the 
whole bicycle to the plug.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Report #63: Stopping Midway From Princeton to New Castle</h2> 
<p> Did I mention that it was wet for much of the Tour de Sol? </p> 
<p> Monday's started with a 37 mile trip from Princeton NJ to the Burlington 
County Institute of Technology (BCIT), a long display with an opportunity to 
charge, and then a 64 mile run to New Castle Delaware.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> The folks at BCIT had big plans for what they called the Eco Living 
Festival.&nbsp; There was music, provided by the Springfield Elementary School 
Band and then a disc jockey, and lunches served by the students in the Food 
Services program, and many school buses bringing students for tours of the 
electric vehicles.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> But it also rained much of the time we were there, sometimes very 
hard.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> - - - - - - - - - </p> 
<p> Kathryn (Kate) Skelly is the daughter of Michael Skelly who is a member of 
the NESEA Board of Directors.&nbsp; She has been to many Tour de Sols, often 
helping out.&nbsp; This year, at the Burlington County (NJ) Institute of 
Technology she helped run the Eco Living Festival's &quot;Junior Solar 
Sprint&quot; races.&nbsp; For this event school kids are given a solar panel 
and a motor.&nbsp; And from these and whatever materials they can come up with, 
they are to devise a vehicle that will carry an empty soda can from the start 
line to the finish line following a guide wire.&nbsp; Normally this is done 
outside, in the sunlight.&nbsp; However, since it was pouring rain much of the 
day, they had a backup plan.&nbsp; &quot;We covered the solar panel with a 
piece of foam core board rubber banded over it.&nbsp; Then we used two AA 
batteries to drive each of the cars.&quot; About 20 to 25 teams competed.&nbsp;
</p> 
<p> &quot;A lot of cars did very well, but a few did not even move.&quot; </p> 
<p> Which was the coolest car? &quot;One, called the `The Blue Lightning 
Bolt', had a blue cover which was completely removable.&nbsp; About 30 small 
pieces of wood were glued together to make the chassis.&nbsp; The soda can sat 
inside, the cover went over that, and the solar panel, foam core, and battery 
pack went on top of that.&nbsp; It was cool because it didn't wobble, and it 
was like complicated, but like really simple.&quot; Sophisticated? 
&quot;Sophisticated! I knew it was one of those words.&nbsp; I think it won for 
design.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> &quot;There was another one that was just the solar panel, a piece of 
wood, a few wheels, and it went like _really_ fast and always got to the finish 
line like zooooom!&quot;</p> 
<p> Kate didn't have a car of her own, because she was helping run the 
event.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> - - - - - - - - - </p> 
<p> #97 `Project e- 2' suffered a blowout on the right (rear) tire when they 
ran over some &quot;rail-road sized rocks&quot;.&nbsp; Replacing the tube and 
tire took about half an hour.&nbsp; &quot;After that, it was pretty clear 
sailing,&quot; said Robert Martin.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> It struck me that handling a Human-Electric Hybrid such as the `Project e- 
2' tricycle takes a bit of practice.&nbsp; On top of pedaling and steering, and 
two hand brakes, there is a button for a brake light, and a throttle 
control.&nbsp; So do you just pedal and add power, or just use power and pedal 
once in a while, or what? &quot;You pedal and add power by turning on the 
throttle.&nbsp; It gives you an extra boost of energy and pushes you along a 
little faster.&nbsp; I got up to 28 or 30 miles per hour.&nbsp; I didn't really 
want to go too much faster than that (in this weather) for safety reasons.&quot;
</p> 
<p> The trike rides very low, maybe 2 1/2 feet off the ground at the highest 
point.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> - - - - - - - - - </p> 
<p> Monte Gisborne said that #13 `The Electrifly' is operating on Plan B, 
using a 7 1/2 Amp charger instead of the refrigerator-sized 3-phase charger he 
had hoped to use.&nbsp; 7 1/2 amps is just not enough to get a full charge in 
the 12 hours normally allotted, but Monte may ask the NESEA Tour Jury if he can 
take a penalty and start charging early and get off the plug late so he can at 
least drive the legs.&nbsp; The Jury is much more interested in vehicles moving 
under their own power, which is why the Solar Commuter vehicles can plug 
in.&nbsp; What's the point of towing a car from display to display because 
there is no sun, and what's the point of towing a car because the backup 
charger isn't strong enough?</p> 
<p> - - - - - - - - - </p> 
<p> The charging trailer has seen been seeing a lot of ground faults in all 
the rain.&nbsp; Sometimes its for something as simple as a plug sitting on the 
ground and slowly getting wet.&nbsp; #94 `Hopper EV' had that problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p> Other times it was more subtle.&nbsp; #10b, `Shocker III' rediscovered 
that having two Ground Fault Interrupters (GFIs) in the same circuit can cause 
one to keep tripping.&nbsp; The charging trailer has a GFI on each plug, and 
then some chargers have a GFI built in.&nbsp; The result is the one in the 
charging trailer will have a tendency to trip.&nbsp; Because it took them too 
long to figure this all out, they did not get a good recharge at BCIT, and thus 
lost their tie-for-first in the Commuter Category with #16 `The Olympian'.&nbsp;

<h2>Report #64: Stories From New Castle and Dover Deleware</h2> 
<p> New Castle Deleware, Monday night: </p> 
<p> </p> 
<p> The driver of #23 `Viking 23' wound up plowing through the mud Monday 
evening in New Castle, Roseanne Gile told me.&nbsp; &quot;Coming on to the Air 
Force base, our driver overshot the turn but tried to make it anyway.&nbsp; He 
full-locked the wheels, but it didn't help.&nbsp; He slid right into the median 
and off into this ditch full of standing water.&nbsp; But before we could get 
to him to try and push him out, he just drove out using the rear (engine 
driven) wheels.&nbsp; We have 4- wheel drive capability, but we didn't need to 
use it.&nbsp; I was amazed.&nbsp; I didn't think we could do it.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> &quot;The car weighs 2009 pounds without the driver and passenger.&nbsp; 
The carbon fiber chassis without any of the suspension or any components 
attached to it is 80 pounds.&nbsp; The chassis was built in 1993 and 
1994.&quot; And it is not showing any signs of cracking or delamination.&nbsp;
</p> 
<p> - - - - - - - - - </p> 
<p> It seems the Lawrence Tech folk pulled an all-nighter.&nbsp; On Tuesday 
afternoon in Dover Nick Brancik said, &quot;We were working on the car until 4 
o'clock this morning in the trailer.&quot; #4 had a problem with the belt that 
goes from the electric motor into the transmission housing on the back of the 
diesel engine.&nbsp; They got that resolved, but were only able to drive 12 
miles on Monday and 36 miles on Tuesday.&nbsp; ((The challenge of a hybrid is 
that you have the complexity of each of two very different drive systems, plus 
the complexity of making them work together.&nbsp; A weakness anywhere can bite 
in ways that are hard to find and, because the complexity also eats up all 
available room under the hood and elsewhere, hard to get to.))</p> 
<p> - - - - - - - - - </p> 
<p> Dover Deleware, Tuesday afternoon and evening: </p> 
<p> </p> 
<p> Scott Isgar raced in the 1994 Tour de Sol with his VW Vanagan EV known as 
`Solar Delivery'.&nbsp; This year he is with us driving a 37 foot long, 10 
person Recreational Vehicle which NESEA is using as a moving office.&nbsp; It 
has 16 Siemens 53 Watt solar panels on the roof with a Trace 5548 inverter and 
a Pulse control panel.&nbsp; The battery pack is made up of 16 Trojan T-145 
blocks, which may be increased to 24 blocks.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> The vehicle will be rented to the Manhattan movie, advertising, and 
commercial industries as an on-site shooting makeup and dressing rooms.&nbsp; 
When finished it will have two air conditioners, plus many, many mirrors and 
makeup and dressing lights.&nbsp; &quot;Hopefully, in the middle of the summer, 
it should be able to run for 10 or 12 hours.&nbsp; That remains to be seen, but 
that is our goal.&nbsp; It will be rented daily to production companies, 
commercial companies, advertising agencies, and anyone who wants to go on site, 
out of the elements.&quot; It can be configured for office, wardrobe/makeup, or 
semi-sleeping.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> The company is `Solar Delivery' at 718 816-1126.&nbsp; </p> 
<p> - - - - - - - - - </p> 
<p> Ben Hall of #62 `Garnet One' said their one problem so far was being low 
on transmission fluid, which was easily fixed.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> - - - - - - - - - </p> 
<p> On Monday #93 `Helios the Heron V' was having trouble getting a good 
charge.&nbsp; But on Tuesday they made it to Dover with no difficulty.&nbsp; 
What made the difference? Teacher and technical advisor Topher Waring told me 
that they had found, &quot;a bad connection that we fixed.&nbsp; We have about 
114 Volts left, which is pretty good.&nbsp; Dead is just about 100 Volts.&nbsp; 
We are not going to push our batteries, because we need to use them all 
winter.&quot;</p> 
<p> While I was talking with the Helios group, Ashley Roslund showed me their 
Battery Monitoring Panel.&nbsp; Inside a shallow wooden box are ten RJ-11 
telephone jacks.&nbsp; Each jack is like the one on the wall at home that you 
plug your phone into.&nbsp; An RJ-11 plug, like the one on the end of your 
phone cord, is connected to a set of color coded screws: red, green, black, and 
yellow.&nbsp; &quot;Each phone jack is hooked up to two batteries.&nbsp; When 
we plug into, say, number 10 like it is right now, we can take a small battery 
tester and hook it up to colored screws, and that lets us read the 
batteries.&nbsp; Yellow and green go to negative and black and red go to 
positive.&quot;</p> 
<p> I also wanted to see the &quot;computer thingy with the light 
bulbs&quot;.&nbsp; &quot;When we are charging, these make sure that we don't 
over charge the batteries, because if we do that we can kill a battery.&nbsp; 
Each computer chip has its own battery.&nbsp; We hook the positive and negative 
terminals on the computer chip to the positive and negative terminals on the 
battery.&nbsp; When the battery is fully charged, the light bulb will flash to 
use up the (excess) energy.&quot; I happen to know that the &quot;computer 
chips&quot; are sold under the name Rudman Regulators.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> - - - - - - - - - </p> 
<p> #37 `Solar Tiger II' has been having some difficulties.&nbsp; &quot;Our Z2 
charger went.&nbsp; It worked once and never worked again.&nbsp; So the `Sungo' 
team let us borrow a Solectria charger, and the Solectria folks set it up on 
the computer to charge us.&nbsp; But they didn't set it up for enough because 
they were not sure how much we could handle.&nbsp; So tonight they are going to 
charge at an even higher rate.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> &quot;Otherwise the car has been doing fine.&nbsp; The steering hasn't 
done anything bad and the brakes work.&quot;</p> 
<p> Teams helping out other teams is a sign of the friendships that develop 
during the week.&nbsp; Helping out a team, even one racing in the same category 
as you are, goes on all the time.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> - - - - - - - - - </p> 
<p> Tony Krabowski told me that the string of bad luck that has hit #4 `Ed' 
continues.&nbsp; The original problem was that the hardened metal spline on the 
electric motor wore away the aluminum insert on the pulley that took the belt 
into the transmission housing.&nbsp; &quot;We were using an aluminum pulley on 
the motor to try and save some weight and inertia.&nbsp; For the last three 
years, everything has been just fine, but this one crept up on us.&nbsp; We 
were up to one in the morning fixing that one.&quot;</p> 
<p> Then today (Tuesday), after making good time for about 36 miles, they 
believe they shorted out their motor controller.&nbsp; Unique Mobility is going 
to FedEx a replacement.&nbsp; &quot;Hopefully that will get us back into the 
race.&quot;</p> 
<p> &quot;One of the things we are trying to do on the Tour de Sol is to get 
some running time on the car, so when we go to the FutureCar competition in 
early June we will have a car that is pretty much bullet-proof.&quot;</p> 
<p> - - - - - - - - - </p> 
<p> `Viking 23', while doing laps to build up their range record, broke the 
clutch cable to the rear engine.&nbsp; Because the rear engine has an 
over-running clutch that free-wheels to reduce the drag, the driver has been 
shifting without the clutch for some time.&nbsp; It was starting from full stop 
that proved to be the real pain of not having a clutch.&nbsp; They found that 
they could just stop the engine, glide to a stop, put it into first gear, and 
then just hit the starter when it was time to go.&nbsp; &quot;It doesn't really 
like it but it works.&quot; Why not start in electric mode? &quot;Our electric 
controller has been swamped a couple of times.&nbsp; We are hoping to dry it 
out tonight and get running on electric again.&nbsp; The rear-view camera is 
working again, after getting flooded a couple of times.&quot;</p> 
<p> `Viking 23' is very low to the ground, with the people reclining pretty 
steeply.&nbsp; Some of the deeper puddles have come up pretty high on the 
car.&nbsp; Since it isn't designed to be water proof, the water gets into the 
passenger compartment pretty easily.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p> </p> 
<p> </p> 
<h2>Report #65: Team Profile - `Re-Chargers'</h2> 
<p> The University of New Haven returns with their #66 `Re-Chargers' pickup 
truck.&nbsp; On the outside, it looked much like last year's entry.&nbsp; But 
under the truck bed it is quite different.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> Where you would expect to see a differential between the rear wheels you 
instead see a transmission, with half-axles going to the wheels.&nbsp; Mounted 
on the bell housing, which is facing toward the rear, is an Advanced DC 9-inch 
motor.&nbsp; Off the &quot;front&quot; of the transmission is a metal rod that 
goes to the gear-shift lever in the cab.&nbsp; &quot;This is off an old 
Volkswagen &quot;bug&quot; we found in the woods.&nbsp; We chopped the back of 
it off, so that is the transaxle and transmission.&nbsp; We custom built the 
mounting plates and suspension.&nbsp; It has 4- wheel independent 
suspension.&nbsp; It handles beautifully.&nbsp; We put a lot of work into 
it.&quot;</p> 
<p> Normally they would be running 160 Volts worth of batteries, but they had 
a problem with one of their batteries, which they took out, and on Tuesday they 
did much, much better.&nbsp; They are now running 154 Volts.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> A V-belt off the tail-shaft of the drive motor goes to an alternator to 
provide regenerative braking.&nbsp; The recovered energy recharges two of the 
traction batteries.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> There are two E-Meters on the dash board.&nbsp; &quot;The second one is 
for our 24 Volt booster pack.&nbsp; We use it to help us climb hills, 
accelerate a little better, and to get a little extra speed on the 
autocross.&quot; Wouldn't that require some heavy duty contactors to add 24 
Volts to the string? &quot;Yeah, you flip a switch and, blam!, you're up 24 
Volts!&quot; And the controller and motor are able to keep up with that.&nbsp;
</p> 
<p> And they have electric heat (which many of the built-for-racing vehicles 
do not), but they have not been using it during the Tour, although I dare say 
they have been tempted.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Report #66: Team Profile - `59 Berkeley'</h2> 
<p> Olaf Bleck has returned with the `59 Berkeley' with a new paint job and 
&quot;some structural improvements.&nbsp; Convertibles are notoriously weak 
between the front half and the back half of the car because there is no roof 
frame.&nbsp; We added a bunch of carbon fiber components, two beams next to the 
seats, all bonded in.&nbsp; The car is solid now.&nbsp; We are not afraid of 
the front and back separating if we hit a big bump.&nbsp; We also tuned the 
suspension up a bit more.&quot;</p> 
<p> The car is bright red, small, and cute and gets lots of crowd 
attention.&nbsp; It looks like a sports car, and moves like a sports car, but 
doesn't sound anything like a sports car.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> The drive system and gear box is the same as last year, and is holding up 
well.&nbsp; They did suffer a battery module failure, which they wired 
around.&nbsp; &quot;We are now running on five-sixths of our original 
capacity.&nbsp; But it is still doing alright.&nbsp; In our rush to get down 
here we forgot to bring the spare modules.&quot;</p>

<h2>Report #67: Team Profile - `Electric Lion'</h2> 
<p> This is Bart Bartholomew's first year with Penn State's hybrid #8 
`Electric Lion', although I know it was at the NESEA Tour in 1996 and 
1997.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> The car has two AC induction motors and controllers, each driving one of 
the front wheels independently.&nbsp; This has the potential to completely 
control each of those wheels to the point that one could be braked while the 
other is powered.&nbsp; Two years ago, at the Tour de Sol Autocross, this 
independent control strategy was very apparent.&nbsp; In very hard turns, the 
inside front wheel on most front-wheel drive cars would lift off the ground and 
that wheel would spin up as the differential transferred power from the motor 
to the unloaded wheel.&nbsp; When the wheel touched the ground again, the 
driver had a hard time keeping the car on track as the car suddenly leaped 
ahead on that side.&nbsp; But on the `Electric Lion', the inside wheel always 
turned at the appropriate rate.&nbsp; When the unloaded wheel once again 
touched the ground, the car was kept on track with ease.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> This year the anti-lock brakes and traction control are operational, but 
the planned yaw control (described in last year's Tour de Sol Reports) is still 
not fully functional.&nbsp; The yaw control is supposed to provide the last 
word in handling performance in demanding conditions.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> &quot;We've got greater control over the fuel carburization on our 
two-cylinder LPG (Liquid Petroleum Gas, aka propane) engine.&nbsp; We had some 
difficulty matching a proper carburetor to it, and we still intend to go to 
injection.&quot;</p> 
<p> Over the summer and fall they intend to work on the car and also take it 
to the local drag strip, about a half-hour away, racing against whoever shows 
up.&nbsp; &quot;We line up and get some weird looks.&quot; Still, they do very 
well.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Report #68: Notes from Wednesday</h2> 
<p> These are a few more quick interviews from Wednesday morning, in Dover 
Deleware, and early afternoon in Sandy Point State Park, near Anapolis 
Maryland.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p> The `CitiVan' has been turning in 60-to-70 mile ranges, considerably more 
than its 40-to-45 mile advertised range.&nbsp; I asked Andrew Heafitz of 
Solectria, a principle designer of the electric delivery truck, why that might 
be true.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> &quot;The Tour de Sol is fairly rural, steady speed driving and the 
`CitiVan' is designed for city driving: heavy stop-and-go, lead-footed 
driving.&nbsp; For example, in New York City we compared the `CitiVan' to 
another truck of similar size and found it did about ten times better as far as 
fuel costs.&nbsp; We used 35 cents, they used 4 gallons.&nbsp; We never got 
above 15 miles an hour on that run.&nbsp; It took about two hours driving about 
12 miles, and I'm told that is fast because it was a Saturday.&nbsp; I've heard 
the average for a United Parcel Service driver in New York is 12 miles because 
they get to a building and spend the time going up and down.&quot;</p> 
<p> I asked what sort of interesting problems did Andrew find in designing the 
`CitiVan'?</p> 
<p> &quot;One interesting thing is the weight doesn't really matter.&nbsp; 
When we were designing solar cars, we were always very conscious of 
weight.&nbsp; But a hundred pounds here, a hundred pounds there out of an 
eleven thousand pound vehicle doesn't make a whole lot of difference.&nbsp; And 
then there's about thirtyfive hundred pounds of payload.&quot;</p> 
<p> - - - - - - - - - </p> 
<p> Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company has been both a sponsor and a presence at 
the Tour de Sol for a number of years now.&nbsp; They have brought along a 
shop-trailer equipped to help the teams with any wheel and tire concerns they 
might have.&nbsp; I spoke with Mike Sellers about that.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> &quot;We have dismounted, mounted and them set up for them.&nbsp; We've 
fixed a few flats, including one with a big, long nail in it.&nbsp; We've even 
given out Band Aides and loaned our squeegee to a few people.&quot;</p> 
<p> The trailer is also often used for formal and informal meetings, or just 
shelter from the storm.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> But main purpose of the trailer is tires, and it is prepared to a complete 
mount and balance the latest wheels.&nbsp; &quot;These are all the latest 
rim-clamp machines, designed for the aluminum machines, and a high-speed 
balancer.&nbsp; And there's a compressor for filling up air bottles.&quot;</p> 
<p> Goodyear has been generous supplying several of the teams with their 
tires, including two sets delivered since they got to the rally.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> - - - - - - - - - </p> 
<p> Lynn Darnel of #72 `Sungo' told me why they didn't make the Dover to Sandy 
Point State Park run.&nbsp; &quot;Murphy got a hold of us again.&nbsp; We were 
very careful to plug in at 7 o'clock.&nbsp; We checked and double checked that 
the charger had ramped up to the right charging speed.&nbsp; Then, as the 
individual who had hooked it up stepped out of the car he evidently stepped on 
the connector and disconnected the charger.&nbsp; At 5 o'clock am we checked to 
make sure it wasn't over charged.&nbsp; It wasn't over charged.&nbsp; So we 
only got about an hour and a half of charging.&quot;</p> 
<p> Lynn also told me another story from technical testing on Saturday.&nbsp; 
They broke their parking brake cable early in testing.&nbsp; They were calling 
all over New York City looking for someone who would make a custom cable or 
braise the fitting on the end again.&nbsp; No luck.&nbsp; So they rode up into 
the jeweler's district looking for someone who could silver-soldier a 
repair.&nbsp; No one in the area would even talk to them.&nbsp; Finally, they 
found someone willing to do the work, and who used the last of his oxygen 
finishing the job.&nbsp; `Sungo' was able to pass tech testing and get into the 
rally.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> - - - - - - - - - </p> 
<p> Count on the kids from `Helios the Heron' teams to come up with 
interesting ideas.&nbsp; Karen Budde, Helios' driver told me, &quot;In the 
Holland Tunnel, my navigator says, `If we all drove electric vehicles, the 
Holland Tunnel would smell sweet.' Later, another pipes up, `If we all drove 
electric vehicles, we could get some sleep in New York City instead of 
listening to traffic noise all night.'</p> 
<p> &quot;Last night we calculated that `Helios' was getting 120 miles per 
gallon equivalence.&nbsp; And yesterday we were more efficient than 
Villanova.&quot;</p>

<p> The team shirts for `Spyder Juice' (black with yellow trim and lettering) 
read, &quot;Spyder Juice - You _Know_ You Want Some&quot;.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p> </p> 
<h2>Report #69: An Advisor to a Winning Team</h2> 
<p> Norman Joyner, Jr. is a teacher at Northampton High West in Northampton 
County, North Carolina, and an advisor to #10b `Shocker III'.&nbsp; He spoke 
with me on Thursday morning before we left Sandy Point State Park to drive to 
Washington DC.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> The NEAT (Northampton Electric Auto Team) drivers had to practice driving 
their car on roads.&nbsp; All the other events they've entered have been held 
on closed race tracks.&nbsp; They also had to modify the car to meet the 
requirements of road racing, which meant undoing things designed for track 
racing.&nbsp; For instance, the pins on the outsides of the doors, required for 
the track, had to be replaced with latches that would allow the driver and 
passenger to be able to get out in 10 seconds.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> Putting the money together to finance their competing is a year long 
event.&nbsp; &quot;We have Pig Pickings (where they barbecue hogs), sell 
doughnuts, car washes, what ever, because the school system at West doesn't 
support this.&nbsp; We have to come up with all our own funds and 
sponsorships.&quot; A local machine shop has been a tremendous help, donating 
the construction of the three adaptor plates that mounts the motors on the 
transmissions.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> They started in 1993, when the local power company, Virginia Power, 
sponsored them for one year.&nbsp; After that NEAT had to be self-sufficient 
and the company went on to sponsor other schools for a year to get them 
started.&nbsp; (Virginia Power has since split, and the local company is now 
North Carolina Power.) The second year, NEAT assisted a sponsored school in the 
next county in building a truck, and they have been competing ever since in the 
electric race in Richmond VA.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> But the program is not really about racing.&nbsp; It is about getting 
students interested in learning and working.&nbsp; &quot;They run the entire 
operation and it's like a job.&nbsp; They get credit, we call it pay, according 
to the way they work.&nbsp; If a day goes by and a kid has a headache or 
something, they don't get as many points.&nbsp; On this trip we have had no 
problems.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> In fact, Norman thinks the bad weather has helped them focus on the job of 
getting through the day and down the road.&nbsp; &quot;When it's fair, they 
want to play a lot.&nbsp; But when it was raining, they were focused on the car 
operating well in the water.&quot;</p> 
<p> Norman retired from the military 22 years ago, and has been teaching in 
the federal and public schools most of the time since.&nbsp; He currently 
teaches electrical trades, electronics, and carpentry.&nbsp; He expects to 
retire in about one year.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p> </p> 
<h2>Report #70: Team Profile - `Ovonic-Solectria Force'</h2> 
<p> James Worden tells me that the white 1997 Solectria Force running as #76 
this year is identical to last year, with the same Nickel Metal Hydride battery 
pack that is now a year and a half old.&nbsp; This is the standard Force, based 
on a Geo Metro Sedan, that Solectria has been selling for a number of years 
now.&nbsp; (My 1995 Solectria Force is practically identical, except that mine 
runs on the sealed lead-acid batteries that are still much, much less expensive 
than Nickel Metal Hydride.)</p> 
<p> &quot;We did add an easier-to-read energy gauge, which we thought would be 
good for consumer acceptability (a new scoring parameter in the Production 
Category this year), and a radio.&quot; Where there used to be a dual-needle 
battery Amps and Volts meter there is now a single-needle gauge, labeled 
&quot;Fuel&quot; with a battery icon on it, that reads from &quot;F&quot; to 
&quot;E&quot;.&nbsp; &quot;It is connected to the Amp-Hour meter and a low-cost 
data acquisition thing that's part of the Ovonic pack.&quot; It counts down the 
number of Amp-Hours the battery pack is rated for, &quot;with corrections for 
how fast you do it and stuff.&quot;</p> 
<p> On Tuesday, when the teams went for their range records, #76 drove 224.5 
miles on a single charge.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Report #71: Onward to the Capital</h2> 
<p> Thursday is the fifth day of the American Tour de Sol on the road, and it 
is this day that we leave Sandy Point State Park, outside Annapolis Maryland, 
and drive to Pennsylvania Avenue NW, between 3rd and 4th, in Washington 
DC.&nbsp; The trip is actually more complicated than that.&nbsp; Everyone 
travels at their own pace to Arlington Virginia, just across the Potomac River 
from DC, regroup, and then form a police-escorted parade back to the display 
site.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p> Wednesday afternoon had been fairly sunny, and Thursday dawned sunny and 
warm.&nbsp; It finally felt like the Tour de Sol.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> These are notes and comments from Thursday morning.&nbsp; </p> 
<p> - - - - - - - - - - </p> 
<p> I noticed that #10b `Shocker III' has a double row of red and black banana 
plug jacks on the dash board, each pair wired to a battery block.&nbsp; This 
allows the passenger to take individual block readings as they are going down 
the road.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> - - - - - - - - - - </p> 
<p> The team with #58 `NFA Sol Machine' felt like they were ready.&nbsp; They 
had been gathering photons Wednesday afternoon, and were doing it again this 
morning.&nbsp; &quot;We're getting a good charge; one of the best we have 
gotten so far.&quot; Their solar array tilts on a hinge down the side of the 
car so they can position it perpendicular to the sun's rays.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p> #83 `Sol Survivor IV' also thinks they got &quot;good sun&quot; yesterday 
afternoon and this morning.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p> The Solar Commuter cars get extra credit for the portion of energy they 
derive from sunlight and that often makes the difference when the prizes in 
this category are handed out.&nbsp; The teams in this category really are the 
sun worshipers during the Tour.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> - - - - - - - - - - </p> 
<p> #37 `Solar Tiger II' got their best charge of the week last night.&nbsp; 
&quot;We started time and didn't trip out overnight.&nbsp; We also weren't as 
far down last night when we plugged in.&nbsp; The sun yesterday helped a 
lot.&quot; They went 36 miles yesterday before they had to give up; a personal 
best.&nbsp; Today's run is about 45 miles, so they are going to try and take it 
nice and easy.&nbsp; With luck they'll make it all the way through.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> - - - - - - - - - - </p> 
<p> Jim Dunn told me a bit more about the Smart Wheels motors featured on the 
two bikes entered as #21 `Mach .1', riden by Myhee.&nbsp; It is a 400 Watt 
brushless DC 3-phase motor, that peaks at 750 Watts, transmission, and a 
controller all in a 6-inch diameter hub that is 3.3 inches thick that weighs 6 
pounds.&nbsp; &quot;We make it up into a wheel that can be put on any bike, 
making it an electric bike.&nbsp; It will be a product that will sell for $399 
dollars for a complete Smart Wheel, ready to go.&nbsp; With a throttle, 24 Volt 
battery pack, and charger it will be $549.&quot; The wiring could not be much 
simpler.&nbsp; Out of the axle comes two pairs of wires.&nbsp; One pair goes to 
the battery pack, the other to the throttle.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> Does it really make sense to have all that spinning weight? &quot;It 
really isn't that much extra weight.&nbsp; The wheel ends up being 4 pounds 
heavier than most regular wheels.&nbsp; Last year we ran in the Tour de Sol 
with same technology weighing sixteen and a half pounds and had no 
problems.&nbsp; This year we've reduced down to under six.&nbsp; The difference 
is that is smaller, simpler, and much more compact.&nbsp; It can be used on the 
front or rear wheel, and its a pretty awesome product and you should get one 
for yourself.&quot;</p>

<p> Monte Gisborne's #13 `The Electrifly' is now getting a full charge.&nbsp; 
They finally figured out that his refrigerator-sized charger was not getting 3- 
phase AC before.&nbsp; When it got hooked up correctly, it worked just 
fine.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> - - - - - - - - - - </p> 
<p> Tony Osgood gets sent everywhere to ride the #3 `Ovonic Scooter'.&nbsp; 
&quot;I get send to India, Taiwan, Japan, and get to play with all these fun 
things.&nbsp; I've had a ball driving this down from New York.&nbsp; The rain 
has made it a little tough, but riding across (the Bay Bridge into Sandy Point 
State Park) made up for it.&nbsp; I wouldn't want anyone else me to do 
it.&nbsp; It handles very well It doesn't feel heavy.&nbsp; The center of 
gravity is very low.&nbsp; It's very responsive.&nbsp; We have almost 5 
kiloWatts of peak power in this thing with 100 Newton-meters of torque at the 
rear wheel.&quot;</p> 
<p> - - - - - - - - - - </p> 
<p> Bob Thomas with the #14 `Slipstream' team, told me that they were trying 
to weld on the half-shafts onto the new differential they bought 
yesterday.&nbsp; &quot;The splines were not right.&nbsp; They were ground off 
and now we're trying to weld them on.&quot;</p> 
<p> - - - - - - - - - - </p> 
<p> I've learned, from years gone past, that it is not at all unusual to see a 
member from one team riding as navigator in another team's car during the 
rally.&nbsp; This morning I observed one of the `Helios the Heron V' kids 
riding shotgun for the Toyota `Prius', the pace car of the NESEA Tour and 
someone from #72 `Sungo' was navigating in #94 `Hopper EV'.&nbsp; Also young 
volunteer Mike Skelly was riding in #59 `59 Berkeley', and his younger sister 
Kate Skelly was in #10 `Honda EV Plus'.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> - - - - - - - - - - </p> 
<p> Speaking of Helios, I have a question for Karen Budde (Helios' driver and 
Latin teacher at Riverside School): would a single team member be referred to 
as a Helium?</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p> - - - - - - - - - - </p> 
<p> </p> 
<p> And, finally, some notes from the awards presentations and display on 
Pennsylvania Avenue.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p> The podium was set up with the Capital Dome in the background.&nbsp; 
Surrounding the dome was the gray haze we have come to expect as part of an 
urban skyline.&nbsp; Given that it had just been raining for eleven days, 
almost non-stop until the day before, it took no time at all for the Washington 
DC air to revert to its normal state.&nbsp; Could there be a more pointed 
reminder of the underlying purpose of the Tour de Sol?</p> 
<p> - - - - - - - - - - </p> 
<p> Before the Tour de Sol cars arrived at the display, a Junior Solar Sprints 
event was being held.&nbsp; Morgan Turner of Holy Cross Elementary in Deerpark 
Maryland, had a car that was tearing up the asphalt.&nbsp; &quot;It's a really 
simple design.&nbsp; We put a gear on the motor and a gear on the axle and 
connected it.&nbsp; There are three wheels, one on the axle on the front and 
two on the axle on the back.&nbsp; To keep the solar panel up we formed a 
triangle shape with pieces of cardboard and held it together with masking 
tape.&quot; A couple of clip leads connected the motor to the panel.&nbsp; 
There was also a battery holder, in case there wasn't enough sunlight.&nbsp; 
But there was plenty of sunlight, and some of the cars, such as Morgan's, were 
really hauling.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> Holy Cross had 13 cars in the Solar Sprint race, and there a bunch of 
schools.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> - - - - - - - - - - </p> 
<p> A pick-up group of Washington staffers from Congress, the Coast Guard, the 
Environmental Protection Agency, and the Department of Energy formed a 
Dixieland and Swing Band playing at the display area.&nbsp; The NESEA solar 
panel was there providing power for the public address amplification and their 
electric piano.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> They didn't have a name, so the members and I came up with &quot;The Solar 
Swing Band&quot;.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> - - - - - - - - - - </p> 
<p> The luck with the #4 `Ed' just has not been good.&nbsp; The parade coming 
over from the staging area moved so slowly that they boiled their clutch fluid 
and the car just did not quite make it.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> - - - - - - - - - - </p> 
<p> I heard, by the grapevine, that #94 `Hopper EV' somehow damaged it's gear 
box and thus was unable to get to the display.&nbsp; And Tom was so certain 
that the gear box was going to be much more reliable than the toothed belts he 
had been using.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> In the past two years, including the last time the Tour finished in DC, 
Tom was able to drive from his home in Concord NH to the rally start, through 
the event, and then home again.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p> </p> 
<h2>Report #72: A Reporter's Final Thoughts</h2> 
<p> Through most of these Reports, I attempt to keep an objective mind.&nbsp; 
I'm sure it becomes obvious to some readers that I develop favorite teams as I 
go, but I try not to let that influence the reporting.&nbsp; However in this 
piece I'll take off the Reporter's Hat and allow myself to be more 
opinionated.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> I come to the NESEA American Tour de Sol to see some of what is happening 
with EVs in the real world, and over the past six years I have not been 
disappointed.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> This has been the wettest Tour de Sol I've attended, but it was not the 
first one where the teams had to deal with bad-to-miserable weather.&nbsp; But 
hey, that _is_ the real world, and the Tour de Sol mission is to show that EVs 
have a place in the real world.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> The cars and truck in the Production category showed that they can operate 
in a world of traffic and weather and accomplish their goals.&nbsp; They 
completed each day's run effortlessly and with style.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> The `Honda EV Plus' (#10) especially presents an image of a comfortable 
and capable vehicle.&nbsp; The `Solectria CitiVan' (#77), as a work-horse, sits 
at the other end of the aesthetics scale, with what I am sure had to be the 
worse aerodynamics of all the Tour vehicles.&nbsp; Still it ran the entire 
course and met or beat it's advertised range every day.&nbsp; The market niche 
it is trying to enter may well be ready for an electric delivery van, 
especially if it can fulfill the promise of much lower maintenance and 
operation costs.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> The Commuter Category was led by a pair of high school teams.&nbsp; #32 
`Porche 914 Electric Bull' from Shadow Mountain High in Phoenix AZ drove more 
miles than all but one of the Production vehicles! Close behind was `The 
Olympian' from the team in Cinnaminson NJ.&nbsp; Here the educational purposes 
of the Tour de Sol shine through as the `kids' show that they are ready to take 
their places as adults in the EV world.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> In the DOE Hybrid Category, four college teams carried the flag for the 
idea that hybrid electric vehicles belong in the equation for reducing 
emissions.&nbsp; And even as these four teams tended to be among the first 
under the FINISH banner, they were accompanied by the `Toyota Prius' hybrid 
acting as the Tour's pace car.&nbsp; We need to remember some of the technical 
ideas explored and risks taken by the these and previous hybrids foreshadowed 
the corporate announcements of the past year.&nbsp; The hybrid idea was 
explored at the NESEA Tour half-a-decade before we started to hear about the 
concept vehicles and commercial offerings of the auto manufacturers.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> For those in the DOE Solar Commuter Category, it felt more like the Tour 
de Sog.&nbsp; With very little sunlight until the fourth day, it was easy to 
imagine these teams would fell nothing but discouragement.&nbsp; Still, they 
pushed on, using plug-in juice, managing to generate public interest with their 
imaginative designs (#69 `Solar Commuter Car', # 63 `Sol Survivor IV' and #58 
`NFA Sol Machine') and pure enthusiasm (#93 `Helios the Heron V').&nbsp;</p> 
<p> The One Person Category sported another example of a vehicle that can make 
a difference soon.&nbsp; Even though it delivered 60-to-70 mile-per-charge 
runs, the `Ovonic Electric Scooter' (#3) may be just a novelty in the wide open 
United States.&nbsp; But in those smoggy and noisy cities around the world, 
choking on the exhaust of two-stroke engines, it could be an important part of 
making them more hospitable for their inhabitants.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> And the theme of the human-electric hybrid (HEH) was explored by three 
entrants in the One Person Category.&nbsp; Is there any concept more bizarre 
than driving a car and taking an elevator to go to a gym to ride a stationary 
bicycle and use a stair machine? It seems to me that using the HEH to amplify 
muscle effort thus making personal transportation practical in more 
environments is an idea with legs.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> I also think it is important to remember those who suffered repeated 
technical disappointments and were exasperated by the weather, but stuck with 
it and kept pushing to get back in the rally.&nbsp; They deserve our thanks and 
wishes for a better tomorrow.&nbsp; In a culture obsessed on `who is best' it 
is important to remember those who fill the frame behind the winner's 
circle.&nbsp; They provide the field from which the best rise and to which they 
return when others take their place.&nbsp; The non-best are to be congratulated 
also for having accomplished much, especially in an area where many simply 
choose not to compete.&nbsp; How much better for us, and them, that they tried 
and failed.&nbsp; Let us not follow the all-too- human habit of saying that 
they didn't accomplish anything.&nbsp; Instead, let us say that they showed us 
that they had the courage it takes to improve the world.&nbsp; Their colleagues 
may have been luckier, better prepared, or even smarter, but they were no more 
brave.&nbsp; And when today's disappointment plants the seed of tomorrow's 
insight, then they will try again and the rest of us will all be the better for 
it.&nbsp;</p>

<p> So, that's it folks; The 1998 Northeast Sustainable Energy Association's 
American Tour de Sol United States Electric Vehicle Championship, as seen 
through the eyes of yours truly.&nbsp; Dozen's of people volunteer their time 
and talents all through the year to make this happen, and I thank them for 
letting me be part of their event.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> I hope I've given you the opportunity to understand a little better what 
it is like to push the edge in electric vehicle technology and that these 
Reports will encourage you to seek out more information on how the ideas of 
electric- powered transportation and sustainable energy usage can move from 
novelty to reality.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> Maybe we'll meet in person at the next Tour de Sol, in 1999.&nbsp; If not, 
I hope you and I will return here next May.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> It's been fun.&nbsp; </p>
