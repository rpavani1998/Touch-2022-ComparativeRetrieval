<h1>Walking Tree Vineyard</h1> 
<h1><b>Walking Tree</b> Vineyard</h1> <b>The small, beautifully situated 
Walking Tree Vineyard</b> is a newly developed site on a steep slope directly 
above the winery estate, planted as part of Winemaker Jaeson Mackura's ongoing 
effort to seek out more hillside Cabernet Sauvignon vines in Alexander Valley. 
During the clearing of the site in 2001, our vineyard crew was struck by a 
remarkable tree which, over a period of months, &quot;walked&quot; from the 
vineyard's summit down the steep grade, while remaining completely upright. 
Thus, the vineyard seemed to name itself. The Geyser Peak Winery viticulture 
team has been able to control every aspect of this site's development. Under 
the direction of Viticulturist Mike Stutler, the choice of row direction, 
trellising, clones, rootstock and all other vineyard practices are in keeping 
with the development of a world-class hillside Cabernet site. The very lean 
soil and substantial rock in the vineyard's upper horizon lessen fertility and 
keep fruit and berry clusters small, while sun exposure and microclimate 
provide ideal ripening conditions.<br>
<br>
<b>This ripe, full bodied wine 
reflects the unique topography and microclimate</b> of Walking Tree vineyard, 
with its morning sun influence and mid-valley elevation. Comprised of 12 
pristine acres near the Geyser Peak Winery in the heart of Alexander Valley, 
Walking Tree's eastern facing rows bask in bright sunshine during the morning 
and are protected from direct sun during the hot afternoon. This balanced sun 
exposure promotes slow, steady ripening and ideal flavor development
<p>&nbsp;</p> &nbsp; <strong>High elevation, </strong>with rocky soils drain 
quickly on this steep slope. <br>
