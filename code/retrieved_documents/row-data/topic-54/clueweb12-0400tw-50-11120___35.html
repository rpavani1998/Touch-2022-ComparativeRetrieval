<p>Some time in the next few hours (it is now 3:40 p.m., local time), the 
100,000th visitor will have been to the virtual orchard, according to Sitemeter.
</p> 
<p>Congratulations to whoever you are. Not that there is much reward, but 
someone has to be the one who turns the counter to such a nice round number. If 
no. 100,000 is ever at the real orchard, I will offer him or her some free<em>
fruits</em>. (I have no <em>votes</em> to give away. I have done enough of that 
over the years: I used to vote for Democrats.)</p> 
<p>Also an update on local conditions: Air much better today, Sky blue, other 
than a few high clouds. The air was still a little bluish this morning when 
there was fog. Breathing better, but still feeling the effects (including 
occasional rather violent coughing). Spent most of the day sweeping and 
dusting. Amazing that even indoors, in a building that was mostly closed up 
during the worst, there could be so much dust and fine ash from the fires.</p> 
<p>Blogging activity will remain minimal while catching up on work and 
recovering from the physical and emotional stress of the preceding week.</p>

 28 October 2007 Locals: What&rsquo;s the smoke 
like? <br>

<p></p>  Planted by MSS <br>

<p><em>Revised and extended (as they say on Capitol Hill).</em></p> 
<p>I hope some readers in San Diego and nearby counties can report what the 
smoke is like in their areas today.</p> 
<p>It is really bad here today. A blue-grey haze. Much worse than yesterday, 
when we actually had high clouds and some light rain showers, after which it 
actually got clear. It is not clear (so to speak) to me whether this is just 
localized in the canyons areas, of all over.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>Compare the above photo with the one from 23 October. Bad as it has been 
today, it could be worse!</p> 
<p>Friday night it was clear enough that the (just past full) moon actually 
was a pure white again. Last night too. Earlier in the week, it had been a 
rather unpleasant orangish color due to all the smoke in the sky.</p> 
<p>I don&rsquo;t have any moonshots to post (surprising, I know), but here is 
what the<em>sun</em> looked like on 24 October.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>And the next photo shows the sky yesterday afternoon. There were lots of 
clouds and even some light rain. It is amazing that any rain could fall given 
how dry the atmosphere has been. We still have had ground-level humidity barely 
go above 50% at any point in the past week except early Saturday morning, when 
it was briefly in the 80s.</p> 
<p>Even when the light rain was falling, the humidity was quite low (30% 
range). We were out in the afternoon and passed through Escondido during a 
surprisingly good (but brief) rain shower. Even under the cloud cover, we could 
see a thick column of smoke still rising from a fire in the distant northeast, 
near Palomar Mountain. (No camera handy then, unfortunately; it was quite an 
impressive sight.)</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>The photo above also gives some idea of the ash fall here at the finca. The 
grime and dirt you see on the sidewalk here is actually mostly ash.</p> 
<p>Today it is hot again. 92 at last check,with 17% humidity. But winds have 
been light and mostly from the southwest.</p> 
<p><strong>Update:</strong> After about 1:00 p.m. it has become a good deal 
clearer here.</p>

Argentine elections today <br>

<p></p>  Planted by MSS <br>
 Planted in: Argentina <br>

<p>I am rather too preoccupied with the smoke and ash around the finca to have 
much to say here, but&hellip;</p> 
<p>Elections for president and congress in Argentina are today.</p> 
<p>The president is elected by qualified plurality: 45% suffices for a 
first-round victory, as does a plurality of between 40% and 45%, as long as the 
runner-up trails by at least 10 percentage points. There is probably no doubt 
that the next president will be the wife of the current Peronist one 
(Kirchner). Is there any chance of a runoff? Doubtful, I think. (There has not 
been a runoff since the current rules replaced an electoral college in 1995, 
though there should have been once: In 2003, the Peronists split and presented 
several candidates, but the number two candidate, former president Carlos Menem 
withdrew, and the runoff was never held. Nestor Kirchner became president on 
around a quarter of the votes.)</p> 
<p>Argentina is the only country in the world to have staggered terms for its 
lower house (as far as I am aware). In each province, half the deputies will be 
elected today (plus or minus one in the case of odd numbers). Closed-list PR.
</p> 
<p>There are also elections for federal senators in some (half?) of the 
provinces. Closed-list plurality with limited nominations (i.e. two candidates 
nominated per party, with the plurality electing both and the second party 
electing its first-ranked candidate).</p> 
<p>I hope some readers can fill in details or offer corrections in the 
comments. This is all off the top of my rather hazy head.</p>

 26 October 2007 Google Earth view of fires <br>
<p></p>  Planted by MSS <br>
 Planted in: Wildfire &amp; Earthquakes <br>

<p>If you have Google Earth (and if you do not, why not?) and want to see 
where the fires burned, theSD County Emergency website now has maps that 
overlay theapproximate fire perimeters on the satellite maps of the county. 
(Clicking that link will download a kml file.)</p> 
<p>When you open the file in Google Earth, the fire areas first appear as big 
green blotches. It took me a while to notice that one can make them transparent 
and thus see what is underneath.1</p> 
<p>Warning: It is sickening. The resolution of Google Earth images is such 
that you can make out not only houses, but features of people&rsquo;s yards. 
You really get a sense of what was burned2, and the images are very hard to 
look at. For some reason, I find this almost more difficult than what&rsquo;s 
shown on TV from ground level.</p> 
<ol> 
<li>Presumably most F&amp;V readers are savvy enough that they would figure 
that out faster than I did, but just in case&hellip; [&#8617;]</li> 
<li>Of course, not everything you see is destroyed. Many structures in the 
burn areas will have survived due to the dedication of firefighters on scene 
and the efforts of homebuilders and homeowners to make homes capable of 
withstanding wildfire. In fact, I am able to identify a street within the 
depicted fire perimeter and on which one friend lives, and I know her house 
survived (but neighbors&rsquo; homes were lost). [&#8617;]</li> </ol>

 25 October 2007 Inside the Rockies&rsquo; 
(former) run <br>

<p></p>  Planted by MSS <br>
 Planted in: The Ballyard <br>

<p>It&rsquo;s great to be back in the old ballyard!</p> 
<p>The other day, while lying around wondering if we were going to be 
evacuated or not (can&rsquo;t do any real work, nor sleep, in such 
circumstances) I added up the runs scored and allowed by the Rockies in their 
incredible 21-1 run from 16 Sept. through the NLCS.</p> 
<p>The result is, well, incredible.</p> 
<p>Through the end of the regular season, 102-52.</p> 
<p>Through the postseason sweeps of Philadelphia and Arizona: 34-16.</p> 
<p>Full period from 16 Sept. to 15 Oct.: 136-68.</p> 
<p>Any time you are doubling up your opponent&rsquo;s runs on a regular basis, 
you are doing pretty well.</p> 
<p>Then came game 1 of the World Series: 1-13. Ouch. Reality sets in. The 
Rockiesprobably really were the best in the NL over the full season&ndash;even 
if it took an incredible run with much good fortune to make it happen. 
According to the Bill James Pythagorean Baseball Theorem&ndash;that is, 
expected W-L based on runs scored and allowed&ndash;the Rockies actually 
slightly<em>under</em>-achieved during the season. They should have been 92-71 
(in 163 games, though in this hypothetical world, they would have played just 
162), a record with which they would have won the west by a game or two over 
relatively easy &ldquo;shoulda-been&rdquo; wild-card winner, San Diego. So, 
their run after 16 Sept. was nothing but a &ldquo;late-course 
correction,&rdquo; albeit probably the most implausible one of all time given 
how time was running out on the season.1</p> 
<p>Now the NL&rsquo;s best is up against clearly the best team2 in a far 
superior league. The AL champion just demolished a very good Cleveland team, 
which is certainly much superior to the Rockies. Oh, sure, that series went the 
full seven and the Red Sox trailed, 3 games to 1, after the first four. But 
while the Indians made the series interesting, in the end the series only 
showed what a dominant team the Red Sox are. They outscored the Indians, 51-32. 
Any time you are outscoring your opponent by a factor of almost 1.6, you are 
doing pretty well.3</p> 
<p>Is continuing to be on the wrong end of a 13:1 scoring ratio in the 
Rockies&rsquo; near-term future? Surely not. But they would have to have 
considerable good fortune to win this series, given that the AL&rsquo;s 
continuing superiority has again guaranteed its champion up to four home games. 
Both teams have remarkably strong home-field advantages, based on home records 
during the regular season (51-30 for Boston, 51-31 for Colorado). Yet the Red 
Sox were a far better road team (45-36) during the season than were the Rockies 
(a mere 39-42), and the latter team obviously must win at least one game in 
Boston to have any hope in this series. Given that Josh Beckett, as dominant as 
he is right now, is not likely to be too adversely affected in his Game 5 start 
in Denver (if the series even goes that far), a Colorado sweep of its home 
games seems unlikely. In that case, they need two wins in Boston. Tall order.
</p> 
<p>It would be foolish to predict a sweep, so I will not. And if the Rockies 
somehow win tonight, the Series will at least be interesting. From a 
fan-interest perspective, it is a shame that game 7 of the ALCS was effectively 
over as early as was game 1 of the current series, because it was probably the 
last game 7 baseball fans will see for a year. If the Red Sox do not win this 
in five or six, it will be quite an upset. A sweep would be less than a shock. 
But I won&rsquo;t predict one. That would be foolish.</p> 
<p>So, when do pitchers and catchers report?</p> 
<ol> 
<li>At the start of play that day the Rockies were 76-72, which was three 
games worse than their then-expected W-L, or the same deficit of reality from 
expectation that they would have at the end. How much did they over-achieve 
during their 21-1 run? At such a small number of games, the Pythagorean 
estimates are not going to tell us as much, but a team with their runs scored 
and allowed during those 22 games should go about 18 and 4. So, they were only 
3 games above expectation. That&rsquo;s how good they were during this run. For 
those final 14 regular-season games, excluding the extra playoff to break the 
wild-card tie with the Padres, they would be expected to have been about 11-3. 
Of course, given how they had underachieved through 16 Sept. and how the 
Diamondbacks (who should have ended up 79-83) over-achieved all season, the 
Rockies needed every one of those excess wins! And their one loss in the final 
14 games of the 162-game season almost cost them their well deserved postseason 
berth. [&#8617;]</li> 
<li>The Red Sox scored 867-657 during the season, which would translate into 
an expected<strong>103-59</strong>! They were &ldquo;only&rdquo; 96-66, same as 
the Indians (whose expected W-L was just 92-70). Under-achievers, those Sox! As 
more testament to how good the AL East is, all the teams except Baltimore 
actually underplayed their expectations, and Baltimore was only 1 game better 
than expected. The Yankees ought to have been 99-63. [&#8617;]</li> 
<li>Of course, outscoring your opponent, even by a very wide margin, is no 
guarantee of winning a series. Just ask the1960 Yankees! [&#8617;]</li> </ol>

Instinct and error <br>

<p></p>  Planted by MSS <br>
 Planted in: Wildfire &amp; Earthquakes <br>

<p>We humans have a well placed instinct to fear fire. We also all have a 
tendency to err. We had quite an experience with both instinct and error this 
week. But first, a little background.</p> 
<p>We have lived at the property we affectionately call the finca, Ladera 
Frutal, since the summer of 2002. It is located inBonsall, south of state route 
76 and west of interstate 15. I felt this area was as safe as any semi-rural 
part of this dangerous county could be, and that&rsquo;s one of the reasons we 
chose to move here, rather than Fallbrook, Coronado Hills (San Marcos), or 
Harmony Grove. Those were all places we seriously considered, to the point of 
looking closely at minute details of property history and legal issues in some 
cases. Those are all places that were evacuated and seriously threatened or 
even burned this week.</p> 
<p>Our own little corner of Bonsall is fairly well protected. Instinct tells 
me that a fire is a fairly low risk here. We have many acres of avocado groves 
all around us. For example, see the banner photo above, where you can see that 
the whole area above our house is covered with groves. (This view is almost due 
north, from the canyon bottom below, and you can see that most of south and 
eastern slopes of Mt. Ararat are indeed covered with avocado trees.) Avocado 
trees will burn, of course, but they burn rather slowly, because they have 
thick leathery leaves and healthy avo trees are full of water (as I am reminded 
every time the monthly water bill comes in). The Santa Ana winds&ndash;those 
fierce, drying winds that come mainly the northeast and mainly in fall and 
winter&ndash;blow less strongly here than most of the canyon areas of southern 
California, because the canyon we are in is one of the few in the area that 
drains from the southeast and then runs due west. Winds can be so strong up 
near highway 76 (which runs in the San Luis Rey river canyon, which in turn 
drains from northeast to southwest) that you can barely stand up, while here 
they will be much weaker. (Parts of Fallbrook this week had 50+ MPH gusts, 
while our greatest was 21.) Between us and the most at-risk areas, there are 
not only lots of avocado trees, but also wetlands. So, of course a fire could 
come and devastate this area. It is in San Diego County, and the whole county 
is at risk. But instinctively, I feel this area is pretty safe&ndash;for a 
semi-rural portion of this region. Yet this week, there was good reason to 
doubt one&rsquo;s sense of safety, to feel a fire was unlikely here was to 
engaged in complacency.</p> 
<p>With the &lsquo;Rice&rsquo; fire&ndash;named after the beautiful and lush 
north-south canyon with&ldquo;one of the least improved through roads in the 
county&rdquo; to our northeast  where arcing power lines ignited dry brush 1
&ndash;quite close and with our finca downwind of it, we were getting fairly 
concerned by Monday afternoon. The most worrisome news up to this point was the 
burning of parts of thePala Mesa Resort, which is about 4.5 miles northeast of 
us.</p> 
<p>At least one of us was up through the night both Monday and Tuesday. 
Finally, at 1:00 onWednesday morning, Merry woke me and told me that the TV had 
listed Bonsall as under mandatory evacuation. I went to the SD emergency 
website and it showed an order for Bonsall<em>north of 76</em>. We are south, 
so we appeared not to be under threat from a fire burning about 3 miles north 
but moving west, nor under orders to get out. Instinct said we were safe. And 
there were stars in the sky and a beautifully clear view of the moon, and 
absolutely no wind. All common sense said that, despite ash floating in the 
air, there was no fire close enough to be an imminent threat and no weather 
conditions that would allow one to rip through the wide and wet riverbed and 
many thousands of avocado trees between the Rice fire and us.</p> 
<p>But conditions can change rapidly, and there were some occasional wind 
gusts on an otherwise calm night. I stayed at the computer, monitoring a 
discussion forum at theNorth County Times website (which includes good maps of 
the fires). This on-line forum was a great resource, a real community service 
by this newspaper. There was notice there about evacuation for all of Bonsall 
posted by their reporter who was moderating the discussion. I asked if he had 
information regarding an evacuation order other than the SD emergency news 
release and he said no, apologizing that he misread the statement regarding 
parts of Bonsall, rather than all of it. (By area, if not by population, by far 
most of Bonsall is south of 76, but the only indications of 
&ldquo;Bonsall&rdquo; on the Thomas Bros. maps &ndash;the standard map resource 
in these parts&ndash;are on the north side, so the error is easy to make.)</p> 
<p>Then shortly after 3:00 a.m., two people posted that there were reverse 911 
calls2 going to areas very close to us and that 211 (the county&rsquo;s 
fire-information hot line) was telling people that all of Bonsall was being 
evacuated, as the fire had jumped Hwy 76 at Gird Road (more or less due north, 
and barely over 2 miles away).</p> 
<p>It was no longer difficult to imagine that winds could pick up around 
sunrise (as the forecast at the time suggested) and that the fire could race up 
the southern wall of the San Luis Rey valley, which has many areas of high 
brush. Because fire naturally burns faster uphill than down, it would not even 
take significant winds for it to advance this way. If it did that, it could 
come up any of the several small canyons that have brush in them and that would 
channel winds, including the winds made by the fire itself. The northern and 
western sides of Mt. Ararat are less irrigated and planted, and have a lot of 
brush. Such a fire would still have to get through a lot of groves&ndash;the 
closest of which was being irrigated all that night&ndash;before it would get 
to us. But by the time it reached the crest of Ararat it would be only about 
half a mile away. Narrow canyons leading down from there could cut off escape 
routes even sooner than the fire could reach us. The disaster scenario was now 
seeming quite real.</p> 
<p>I called 211 shortly after 4:00 and identified my location as south of 76, 
and the operator said that we were required to have been out hours ago! So, we 
got belongings together (really essential things had been in the car since 
Monday, in case something happened without notice), caged four of the five cats3
, and were out by 5:00.</p> 
<p>Only later did I realize that by 4:30, everyone on the NCT on-line 
discussion forum was aware that the reverse 911 calls, the report of the fire 
crossing 76, and the info that all of Bonsall was ordered to evacuate were all 
in error. We never had to get out. My instinct was right all along that there 
was no real risk here from this event. But there had been the risk that we were 
being complacent, and there was the instinctive fear of fire and the fear that 
it was I, and not the emergency operators, who was in error. It is certainly 
better to evacuate unnecessarily than to wait till it might be too late.</p> 
<p>The eight of us (three humans and five felines) went to my 
mother-in-law&rsquo;s place in Vista&ndash;only about 20 minutes away but in an 
area with no threat&ndash;for several hours after 5:00 a.m. Wednesday. We are 
back home safe now. There was no fire here. And there is currently no risk to 
any of Bonsall. The Rice fire is still mostly un-contained, but is burning now 
only on the north and east side of Fallbrook, mostly in unpopulated areas of the
rugged and wild Santa Margarita River valley (where the first railroad to San 
Diego once ran). The ash and sooty grime are unbelievable for an area that did 
not have its own fire&ndash;far worse than in 2003. And the air quality is 
awful, but not as bad as it was Tuesday, nor has it been as bad as it was for 
two days in 2003. It has been a miserable week. But it has not been nearly as 
bad for us as for a half million or so others in the county who evacuated, nor 
for those whose homes were among the hundreds destroyed (and others still 
threatened). We are fortunate to have avoided real danger.</p> 
<p>Thanks to the many colleagues, friends, family and those I 
&ldquo;know&rdquo; only because you read this blog for your expressions of 
concern. I am sorry for the extended absence here. I did not reconnect the 
computer till today, being simply too exhausted and overwhelmed with the 
experience to do much of anything. Fortunately, there is the World Series to 
help get back to normal, and last night it got off to pretty much exactly the 
start I expected. Welcome, Rockies, to the big leagues!!</p> 
<ol> 
<li>I saw an interview with the head firefighter for the region, in which he 
said it was downed power lines that sparked the fire. But later, the SD 
emergency website posted a notice that the Rice fire was &ldquo;human 
caused,&rdquo; but that there were no further details yet. [&#8617;]</li> 
<li>We would learn shortly that such a call&ndash;which we worriedly were 
awaiting&ndash;does not go to unlisted numbers unless you have taken the 
initiative to register your number with the county emergency office. Who knew? 
Perhaps everyone but us. [&#8617;]</li> 
<li>The fifth had to be loose in the car; we&rsquo;ll have to be sure to get a 
fifth carrier just in case this happens again. We hadn&rsquo;t really prepared 
for the &ldquo;finca feline&rdquo; who came with the property, stays outdoors 
other than during freeze or current smoke conditions, and would not even let us 
near her for almost four years before finally warming up to us and revealing 
what a nice cat she is after all. [&#8617;]</li> </ol>

<p>The good news is that the wind has died down. The bad news is that the wind 
has died down.</p> 
<p>This is the view to the southeast (over the persimmons) to the southeast at 
about 7:40 this morning.1 </p> 
<p>That&rsquo;s not fog. That&rsquo;s smoke. Bad day if you need to breathe.
</p> 
<p>When the winds were blowing, we were a rare island of blue sky in a day of 
fires raging to our north, south, and southeast. Once the winds stopped, the 
smoke settled in. This is less fog-like than it was in 2003, when for much of 
the first day after the wind settled, we could not see across the canyon. (As I 
am typing this, however, the visibility is getting worse.)</p> 
<p>With winds blowing up till very early morning, it was warm overnight. It 
was 72 at midnight, and the humidity was only 11%. As the winds calmed down, 
the temperature dropped, but the humidity was still only 25% at its highest. 
Temp dropped only to 63 up the hill, but all the way to 55 down below.2 That 
temperature range shows the impact of slope, calmness, and dryness that 
normally (i.e. other than the freeze of January, 2007) means no freeze up above 
despite winter chill down below.</p> 
<p>I do not think we are out of fire danger yet, but the risk has lessened a 
lot. The most active part of the fire at Fallbrook is the northwest side, where 
there is a lot of open land. Apparently there remains some theat to downtown 
Fallbrook from this fire. Major threats remain to populated areas farther 
south, even all the way to the coast. The region remains under a red-flag 
warning, which has been extended until Wednesday afternoon. Winds forecast to 
pick up again briefly, temperatures could approach 100 today (though the smoke 
clouds could prevent that much heating) and very low humidity will persist.<br>

<br> <br>

<p></p> 
<p>This is the view to the southeast from the finca at around 6:30 this 
morning, right before sunrise.</p> 
<p>For now, the finca should be safe. The winds are blowing out of the 
northeast, so the danger areas are south and southwest of us. But there are 
reports of other, smaller fires to our northeast. Overnight humidity got only 
as high as 21% here, and it was as low as 6% yesterday afternoon. Expected to 
be lower today. And hotter both today and tomorrow&ndash;could reach 100 
tomorrow. Ridiculous for October. And very dangerous.</p> 
<p>This is too much like 2003 again. Very worrisome. Large areas of the 
northern San Diego suburbs are being evacuated.</p> 
<p>Any of my students reading this who have not seen the intranet 
announcement: No class today.<br>
<br>
</p> 
<p><strong>Update (10:53 a.m.):</strong> Still OK here at Ladera Frutal, but 
getting essential items together, just in case. The humidity is down to 7% and 
falling. 84 degrees. No wind here now, which is good. Reports indicate high 
winds elsewhere in the region.</p> 
<p>County emergency officials say this is much worse than the Cedar Fire of 
2003. Hard to imagine. They also say the fire currently burning from east of 
Ramona west to Rancho Santa Fe is highly likely to reach the coast before it 
burns out. That would sever the transportation links between here and the city.
</p> 
<p><strong>Update (1:18 p.m.):</strong> Now the winds are getting stronger (up 
to 16 MPH, much less than many other areas). Temp 87, humidity 5%. Evacuation 
underway in eastern Fallbrook, about 3 miles from here. Still no immediate risk 
here, but with the wind&hellip;</p> 
<p>UCSD has canceled classes for Tuesday.</p> 
<p><strong>Update (3:44 p.m.):</strong> Now, apparently all of Fallbrook is 
being evacuated. That is only a few miles north, but we are currently out of 
the wind-driven path of the smoke (and thus the fire). No advisories have been 
issued here. I can see smoke to the northwest (from the fire in eastern 
Fallbrook, the location of which is more or less due north.) The wind has been 
up above 20 MPH, still far less than elsewhere, but threatening some trees and 
fruit. Still pure blue sky in our immediate area and about 85 degrees and 
humidity marginally up (6%). Ready to go, if necessary, but nothing imminent. 
Looks like a sleepless night or two ahead.</p>

 21 October 2007 Polish parliamentary election 
<br> 
<p></p>  Planted by MSS <br>
 Planted in: Poland; VOTES <br>

<p>In addition to Switzerland, today will also see general parliamentary 
elections in Poland. These elections were called early when the governing 
coalition, in power since shortly after theelections of September, 2005, 
collapsed.</p> 
<p>Given the outcome of Poland&rsquo;s parliamentary and presidential 
elections of 2005&ndash;the first year in which both institutions had been 
elected in close proximity&ndash;Poland has not only the dual executive that 
defines its semi-presidential regime type, but atwin executive.</p> 
<p>Today&rsquo;s election is expected to be close. It is by no means certain 
that the party of the Kaczynski twins, the conservative-nationalist Law and 
Justice (PiS), can retain the premiership. The other main contender is the 
Civic Platform (CO), usually described as a &ldquo;liberal&rdquo; (in the 
European sense) party. The Polish party system is highly fragmented.In 2005, 
the PiS was the largest party with 27% of the vote and 155 of the 460 seats. 
The PO was second with 24.1% and 133. The next largest parties had around 11%. 
The electoral system is districted open-list PR (in 40 districts).</p> 
<p>Under Poland&rsquo;s constitution, the presidency is one of the most 
powerful in (non-XSSR) Europe&ndash;for instance it has a veto that needs 3/5 
to override1 &ndash;but the president&rsquo;s ability to appoint the cabinet is 
limited. The president has discretion to nominate a candidate to be premier, 
and here&rsquo;s betting he will choose his twin brother. However, the premier 
cannot take office until he and the proposed cabinet obtain a vote of 
investiture (and, of course, once appointed, the cabinet depends on the ongoing 
confidence of the lower house).</p> 
<p>EuroTrib will be a good place to follow the elections and the results, as 
they come in.</p>

Swiss election Sunday <br>

<p></p>  Planted by MSS <br>
 Planted in: VOTES <br>

<p>Switzerland&rsquo;s general parliamentary election is 21 October. </p> 
<p>From the <em>Tribune de Gen&egrave;ve</em>:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>Swiss voters go to the polls Sunday to decide who will sit in parliament 
after an uncharacteristically fractious election campaign. Polls show the Swiss 
People&acirc;&euro;&trade;s Party (UDC) with the highest level of support at 27 
percent, followed by the center-left Social Democrats with about 22 per cent. 
Center-right parties are jostling for the balance of power. It is unclear how 
much significant change will happen in the parliament. A system of proportional 
representation system offers several parties an opportunity to gain seats in 
the 200-seat house of representatives, while the 46-seat senate provides 
regional representation for each canton.</p> 
<p>Concern about the environment could improve the chances of the Green party, 
which has strong support in cities such as Geneva, Lausanne and Zurich. But the 
campaign has been dominated by debate around issues framed by the UDC, whose 
anti-immigration policies sparked recent riots in Bern and Lausanne. The 
lightning rod for protest has been Christoph Blocher, the Zurich-based 
billionaire industrialist and UDC cabinet minister. His 
party&acirc;&euro;&trade;s campaign poster showing white sheep booting a black 
one out of the country caused a backlash in some quarters but it 
hasn&acirc;&euro;&trade;t hurt the party&acirc;&euro;&trade;s support.</p>

 19 October 2007 Chips and vetoes <br>

<p></p>  Planted by MSS <br>
 Planted in: AMERICAN POLITICAL REFORM; Vetoes 
&amp; Signing Statements &amp; other (ab)uses of prerogative <br>

<p>As expected, Thursday the House of Representatives voted again, by a large 
majority, in favor the State Children&rsquo;s Health Insurance Program. The 
vote was 273-156. That&rsquo;s more that three-fifths of the House membership, 
and the vote included 44 members of the minority party.</p> 
<p>In most democracies, such a vote, combined with the 69 votes the bill 
previously received in the Senate, would be sufficient to approve this bill and 
make it law. But not in the USA. Thursday&rsquo;s vote was to attempt an 
override of President Bush&rsquo;s earlier veto of the bill. And that, of 
course, requires two thirds of each house to succeed.</p> 
<p>Americans take the veto for granted, and given how hard it is to amend the 
constitution, there is little chance it could be changed. But it might at least 
be a good lesson on democracy if we debated this question:<em>Should we allow 
presidents a veto, subject to override only by a super-majority?</em></p> 
<p>Few Americans would ever think to ask this question. That&rsquo;s a shame. 
The ultimate answer might come down either way, but the important thing is to 
think about the consequences of institutions, and political settlements made 
over 200 years ago, and whether we might do better. Just over a month ago, it 
wasConstitution Day, which marked the day, in 1787, of the final meeting of the 
Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia. There were some low-key celebrations 
of the event, but most of them were more about patting ourselves on the back 
that we have such a great Constitution. Few were about how we might make it 
better. We do have a great constitution. Yet we might make it better, more 
democratic. And the veto provision would be one good place to start.</p> 
<p>We should not fear reform, or shrink from even 
&acirc;&euro;&oelig;radical&acirc;&euro;&#157; ideas for improvement in our 
democracy. Thomas Jefferson, in a letter to Samuel Kercheval, July 12, 1810, 
and in words that are literally carved in stone in theJefferson Memorial, said:
</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>I am certainly not an advocate for frequent and untried changes in laws and 
constitutions&acirc;&euro;&brvbar; But I know also, that laws and institutions 
must go hand in hand with the progress of the human mind. As that becomes more 
developed, more enlightened, as new discoveries are made, new truths disclosed, 
and manners and opinions change with the change of circumstances, institutions 
must advance also, and keep pace with the times. We might as well require a man 
to wear still the same coat which fitted him when a boy, as civilized society 
to remain ever under the regimen of their barbarous ancestors.</p> </blockquote>
<p>Even more, Jefferson warned against what he referred to as 
&acirc;&euro;&oelig;sanctimonious reverence&acirc;&euro;&#157; for the 
Constitution and its founders.</p> 
<p>So, now that we have a veto of a bill to expand children&rsquo;s health 
care, supported by wide bipartisan majorities in both houses, we should ask 
ourselves: Does the veto provision of the constitution still &ldquo;go hand in 
hand with the progress of the human mind&rdquo;?</p> 
<p>Before answering that, we might want to go back and think about what the 
founders themselves felt about the veto. Why do we even have it?</p> 
<p>The primary justification for the veto given in the <em>Federalist Papers
</em> is to protect the executive from encroachments on its authority. For 
instance, Madison in Federalist 51, in a passage immediately after offering his 
defense of bicameralism:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>As the weight of the legislative authority requires that it should be thus 
divided, the weakness of the executive may require, on the other hand, that it 
should be fortified.</p> </blockquote> 
<p>Hamilton elaborates the institutional argument for the veto in Federalist 
73:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>The propensity of the legislative department to intrude upon the rights and 
to absorb the powers of the other departments&hellip;; the insufficiency of 
mere parchment deliniation of the boundaries of each&hellip;; and the necessity 
of furnishing each with constitutional arms for its defense&hellip; From these 
clear and indubitable principles results the propriety of the negative, either 
absolute or qualified, in the executive, upon the acts of the legislative 
branches. Without one or the other the former would be absolutely unable to 
defend himself against the depredations of the latter.</p> </blockquote> 
<p>Independent institutions, in Madison&rsquo;s and Hamilton&rsquo;s logic, 
will have an incentive to cooperate with one another, and to respect each 
other&rsquo;s domains, only to the extent that they also have overlapping 
powers. That is, separation of powers also requires sharing of powers. Through 
such sharing of powers between separate institutions, two (or more) branches 
are induced to transact with one another, i.e., to exchange and cooperate to 
accomplish their respective functions.</p> 
<p>That is to say that the founders&rsquo; justification for the presidential 
veto is an entirely<em>institutional</em> one. The reader of the Federalist 
papers or other works of the founders of the US Constitution would be hard 
pressed to find a<em>political</em> justification, by which I mean one that 
speaks to the electoral and policy-making consequences of the veto.</p> 
<p><em>I am aware of no normative justification for the veto that says it 
should be used to defend the interests of an ideological minority against the 
democratic expression of a majority.</em> Nonetheless, defend an ideological 
minority is just what Bush has done with this veto. In hisveto message, he said:
</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>This bill would shift SCHIP away from its original purpose and turn it into 
a program that would cover children from some families of four earning almost 
$83,000 a year. In addition, under this bill, government coverage would 
displace private health insurance for many children. [...]</p> 
<p>Because the Congress has chosen to send me a bill that moves our health 
care system in the wrong direction, I must veto it.</p> </blockquote> 
<p>Maybe Bush has a point. Maybe this is a bad decision by Congress. If so, 
score one for Hamilton: The President has used his discretion to save us from 
moving policy in the &ldquo;wrong direction.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>But, of course, all these issues were debated in Congress. And the 
President&rsquo;s position was defeated. It obtained only around 40% of the 
votes.</p> 
<p>Hamilton and Madison, in making the institutional logic for why the veto is 
in our constitution, did not contemplate the possibility that the President 
would simply represent another minority faction, and use his veto to enforce 
the will of that minority against the majority. (Madison did not even want a 
strong veto; he proposed a president elected by Congress and with no ability to 
block what a majority wanted. He also did not want a Senate as we know it. His 
so-calledVirginia Plan was quite a radical, majority-rule document!)</p> 
<p>Do we still want a veto? Maybe, maybe not. But we ought to at least be 
willing to ask the question! We should be willing to have a debate about how 
democratic our constitution&rsquo;s lawmaking process is, and let the chips 
fall where they may.</p> 
<p>____<br>
 Some of this planting draws on a similar critique of Bush&rsquo;s 
first veto, ofthe stem-cell bill, in July, 2006. There, I contrast Bush&rsquo;s 
veto message on that bill with one issued by Madison himself, when he was 
President. The difference are striking!</p>

Election in Canada? <br>

<p></p>  Planted by MSS <br>
 Planted in: Canada; VOTES <br>

<p>On Wednesday night the Governor General of Canada delivered the Throne 
Speech, by which the agenda of the government for the coming parliamentary 
session is formally made public. Given that the current government, headed by 
Prime Minister Stephen Harper and the Conservative Party, has only a plurality 
of seats in the House of Commons, election speculation is rife.</p> 
<p>A vote on the Throne Speech is a confidence matter. However, the current 
indication is that most members of the Liberal party will abstain, which would 
be good enough for Harper to remain in office.</p> 
<p>Votes on the individual bills are another matter. The government needs the 
support (or abstention) of at least one other party to pass its bills (and they 
also require support of the Senate). Many of these will be confidence matters, 
too, starting with thecrime bill.</p> 
<p>I wonder what those closer to the unfolding events think. From my vantage 
point, I can&rsquo;t decide whether Harper is hoping for an election. It 
certainly looks as though the Liberals fear one. I can&rsquo;t think of a 
reason why either the NDP or the Bloc would want an election soon. So, my guess 
is an election is not coming soon, as Harper needs some high-profile defeat to 
get one, and the other parties like the current situation more than they like 
the idea of taking a chance on a Conservative majority&ndash;or even a larger 
Conservative minority (which might be the most likely outcome if an election 
were held this fall). The other parties can always let bills pass passively, by 
abstaining or just not having all their members show up. But if the government 
decides it wants an election, it could get more aggressive with the policy 
content of its bills, thereby compelling the opposition parties to vote no.</p> 
<p>See Paulitics for an aggregation of polling trends: The Conservatives 
currently are about five percentage points ahead, though this is may be overly 
sensitive to what looks like an outlier near the end of the current sequence. 
Perhaps more to the point, the three largest parties&rsquo; current standings 
are not much different from what their national vote percentages were at the
January, 2006, election.</p>

<p> If by my laws you walk, and my commands you keep, and observe them,<br>
 
then I will give-forth your rains in their set-time,<br>
 so that the earth 
gives-forth its yield<br>
 and the trees of the field give-forth their fruit.

<p> <strong>F&amp;V time:</strong> This blog's date function is so set as to 
start a new day at approximately local sunset. (Why, if we have &quot;day&quot; 
and &quot;night,&quot; should a new &quot;day&quot; start in the middle of the 
night?)</p> 
<p> <strong>FRUITS:</strong> Support your local, organic growers; and, plant 
vines and fig trees and pomegranates for the generations to come...</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p> <strong>VOTES:</strong> For democratization and full representation, for 
environmental sustainability, social justice, and peace, always sincerely...</p>
