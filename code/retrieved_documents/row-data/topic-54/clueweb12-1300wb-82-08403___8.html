<h1>Italians study light &amp; shading</h1> 
<h3>Blue hail nets result in better bud break than other colors of net, but it 
might not be the best choice.</h3>  Melissa Hansen

<p>The worldwide transformation of tree fruit orchards from low to high 
densities and from wide to narrow canopies marked a major revolution in orchard 
systems. But future improvements to orchard systems likely will be made through 
fine-tuning techniques instead of radical changes, says Italy&rsquo;s Dr. Luca 
Corelli.</p> 
<p>Previous scientific studies have helped growers understand the importance 
that light plays in fruit production, said Corelli, plant physiologist in the 
horticultural department of the University of Bologna. Growers responded in the 
last few decades by adopting vertical and V-type training systems that better 
intercept light.</p> 
<p>With the major tree-training changes already implemented by growers, 
Corelli believes that improving size and quality in the future will be through 
small steps that result in only incremental changes.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;The orchard today is a highly technological enterprise,&rdquo; he 
said, likening the orchardist to a racecar technician who must expertly keep 
the car at peak performance. &ldquo;If you miss the fine-tuning by one-quarter 
of a turn of a screw, you miss your chance of winning.&rdquo;</p> 
<h3>Managing competition</h3> 
<p>The process that turns light into fruit, is complex and fraught with 
chances of mistakes. If all goes well, Corelli explains, light is used for 
photosynthesis and carbohydrates are partitioned throughout the plant in the 
fruit, leaves, trunk and shoots, and roots. Dry matter partitioning is a highly 
competitive phenomenon, and growers must learn to manage the partitioning if 
they want the tree to produce large fruit, which goes against the tree&rsquo;s 
natural instinct of producing lots of small fruit.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;If we manage this competition properly, you can shift some 
percentage points in the dry matter partitioning to fruit growth,&rdquo; he 
said, adding that growers must understand that on the road of turning light 
into fruit, the tree can&rsquo;t make up lost time.</p> 
<p>For example, he noted that Fuji apples in the Bologna area grow about two 
grams per day. &ldquo;If you make a mistake with irrigation and it&rsquo;s off 
for ten days in a row, you can&rsquo;t make up that twenty grams unless you 
remove plant material.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;Be aware that a day lost is a day lost. We cannot &shy;accelerate 
above the influential rate of light from the sun.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Corelli, who spent time at Cornell University and has collaborated with 
Cornell&rsquo;s Dr. Alan Lakso on light interception and fruit development, is 
studying how different aspects of light interception (shading, row orientation, 
and hail net color) affect fruit production. He shared the details of his 
research projects with an international group of tree fruit growers who visited 
the University of Bologna last fall.</p> 
<p>One experiment involves using shading as a way to thin the crop load, 
&ldquo;shocking&rdquo; the fruit to make it fall off without chemical thinning. 
European Union growers can no longer use carbaryl for chemical thinning, and 
Corelli is worried about the long-term future in Europe for other chemical 
thinners. Most Italian growers already use hail nets, so the structures to 
install shade cloths are already in place.</p> 
<p>He is using Lakso&rsquo;s apple thinning model that was developed to help 
growers factor in weather data, the carbohydrate supply, and the demand of 
apple trees when deciding how aggressive their chemical thinning efforts should 
be. Corelli said the model should help them avoid excessive fruit drop, as well 
as to know when to remove the nets.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;In our shading trials, we know we can cause fruit to drop, but we 
don&rsquo;t want excessive thinning. Already, he&rsquo;s observed that peaches 
are more sensitive to shading than apples. &ldquo;We wiped out a peach crop 
from one week of shading,&rdquo; he said, noting that three days of shading in 
peaches can cause fruit drop. However, it took five to seven days of shading to 
show effects in Pink Lady and Golden Delicious apples.<br>
Corelli also thinks 
shading could have thinning applications for self-fertile varieties of sweet 
cherries, though he hasn&rsquo;t studied cherries.</p> 
<h3>Rainbow of nets</h3> 
<p>Italian scientists are also looking at the effects of different hail net 
colors on other aspects of fruit production. Some of the interest in netting 
color comes from attempts by local governments in the South Tyrol region to 
mandate specific net colors to minimize the landscape blight that officials 
believe has a negative impact on tourism.</p> 
<p>Corelli said that some believe that the extensive use of dark gray hail 
nets in the tourist region is ruining the view. &ldquo;The environmentalists 
want hail nets to be green, but that is the one color to avoid because it 
depresses &shy;photosynthesis.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Initial research shows that blue hail nets result in more buds breaking 
than some of the other colors, he said. &ldquo;If you go to Zurich, the color 
of choice for hail nets on tree fruit and grapes is blue. It&rsquo;s a nice 
color because it fits in well with the lake region, but is it the best choice 
in terms of fruit production? I have strong reservations that it is not.&rdquo;
</p> 
<p>As scientists learn more about how the plant uses different light 
frequencies, including ultraviolet and infrared, he envisions orchards in the 
future that would use three or four different colors of netting material, at 
different times. The colored nets could be layered in the appropriate order 
needed.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d see one color used for bud break, another color if you 
want to make shoot growth be shorter, and the top layer may reflect the sky to 
make the net disappear for environmental impact.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Moreover, Corelli sees a future when growers might plant rows at specific 
angles, such as a northeast to southwest orientation or northwest to southeast, 
with trees angled to the east or west, to maximize light interception and 
photosynthesis while minimizing damage from too much light.</p> 
<p>He has a trial with trees planted in different directions and angles, and 
is measuring photosynthesis by putting plastic bags over whole trees. In 
addition, he is studying the interaction of plant stress and the timing of 
irrigation to learn if fruit size can be influenced by irrigating in the 
afternoon rather than the morning.&ensp;</p> <br>
