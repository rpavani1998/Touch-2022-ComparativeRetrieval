A record of a 
sailing trip around the world on the Norweigan built 1935 Gaff ketch 
&quot;Lista Light&quot; during 2004-2006<br>
<br>
<br>
 The journey so far&#133;
<br><br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Lista light was built in 1935 in Flekefjord, 
Norway. Prevously a schooner, she is now (since 2001) a ketch with a gaff rig 
and topmast, measuring 15m LOA with an additional 3.8m bowsprit. She is 5.1m in 
the beam, draws 2m and weighs 35 tonnes. The original owners were Norweigan and 
used the boat as a fish transporter until 1972 when she was bought and 
converted into a cruising boat by Noel Bevan. She was converted to a Gaff Ketch 
by her last owner, Jay James, who took over from 1986. She now has to guide 
Dave and Katharine to new shores astride her ample hips! We are the privileged 
custodians of a boat who has only enjoyed 4 owners in her 73 years. She has 
completed several atlantic crossings and a full circumnavigation under previous 
ownership and has attended the Brest / Douarnenez wooden boat festival since 
1988. This year a new chapter in her life begins.....<br>
<br>
<b>Hull</b> <br>

<br> Pitch pine on pitch pine in true working tradition, with more recent 
planking replaced in larch. She is massively constructed with principal timbers 
measuring as follows:<br>
Frames 6&quot; x 9&quot; at 18&quot; centres<br>

Stringers 18&quot; x 2&quot;<br>
Deck beams 6&quot; x 6&quot;<br>
 Beam shelf 
12&quot; x 3&quot;<br>
 Decking 2&quot; x 3.5&quot;<br>
<br>
 She is a double 
ended vessel, distinguished from a Colin Archer (for which she is often 
mistaken) by being plumb in the stem rather than cut away in the forefoot. She 
is of carvel construction, with planking fastened by juniper and more recently 
green oak tree nails of up to 30mm diameter. Planking is also fastened with 
6&quot; galvanised dumps along stem, stern, garboard and the butt ends of 
planks.<br>
<br>
<b>Engine and Drive</b> <br>
<br>
The original single cylinder 
Wichmann semi diesel engine was replaced in 1988 by a conventionally aspirated 
Perkins 6.345 inline 6 cylinder engine, which drives a Borg Warner 2.9:1 Velvet 
Drive transmission, coupled via an R&amp;D coupling to a 2.5&quot; stainless 
propshaft and stern tube with a conventional stuffing box and cutless bearing 
to 3-bladed prop measuring 20&quot; x 30&quot;. Both the engine and gearbox are 
operated by Morse controls mounted near the wheel.<br>
<br>
Lista Light carries 
258 gallons (1173 litres) of diesel in 2 stainless tanks and consumes 
approximately 1.3 gallons per hour at 6 Knots (1500rpm) giving a range under 
engine of some 1200 miles. The tanks can be drawn from separately or together 
and are fed to the engine via 8mm copper pipe, through separate sediment bowls, 
water traps and inline fuel filters. Both tanks have separate water drains at 
their bases. The engine is situated in the centre of the engine room enclosed 
in an easily accessible insulated slot sided box which also acts as a work 
bench. Cooling is conventional via a sea water cooled heat exchanger and wet 
exhaust.<br>
<br>
<b>Electrical and Water Systems</b><br>
<br>
The electrical 
system is 24v using 5 pairs of 12v batteries and a single 12v battery. One pair 
is dedicated to the anchor winch and the other pair to engine starting, though 
both are parallelled together for resilience. The third bank of three pairs are 
deep cycle domestic batteries for all other power needs which include the 
fridge, lighting, navigation lights and equipment, interior lighting, radar, 
etc. The 12v standalone battery operates the Lister generator starter.<br>
<br>

Battery charging facilities include a 24v 60A Motorola alternator driven by the 
Perkins diesel, a mains operated battery changer, and solar power cells, all of 
which charge either a single battery set or multiple battery sets via a 
parallelling relay. The 12v standalone Lister start battery is charged via a 
12v inverter driven from the 24V domestic system and from the Lister Generator 
alternator.The Lister generator also provides 5kVA mains 240c AC power for 
running the 50A @ 24v mains intelligent battery charger or other items when 
under sail.<br>
<br>
The entire boat was rewired in 2001, although many items 
have been added since. An instrument and switch panel in the engine room 
consists of VDO instruments for engine oil pressure, gearbox oil pressure, 
tachometer, amps, engine temperature, and engine hours, plus a drive gear alarm 
a light and engine starter switch. There are also fused switches for port 
interior lights, starboard interior lights, navigation lights, navigation 
equipment, mast head light, voltage converter, galley tap pressure pumps, bilge 
pumps, and water transfer pump. The radar system is a Raymarine SL72 with a 2kW 
dome mounted on the mizzen, with the output screen positioned near the chart 
table. Near the steering position there is an electronic compass, log and depth 
sensor readout.<br>
<br>
In the bilge there are 2 x 12v Jabsco 1500 submersible 
pumps wired in series. The galley water delivery system consists of pressure 
operated diaphragm pumps to pressurise the Paloma gas water heater for the 
galley hot tap and also one on the cold side. The hot and cold water at the 
galley sink draw from a 100 gallon header tank on the port side, which in turn 
draws from either aft tank (62 gal), starboard tank (55gal), or collapsible 
starboard tank (52 gal) via a Jabsco lift pump or whale hand alternative. All 
the plumbing is run in semi-rigid plastic.<br>
<br>
In the interests of economy 
of water there is no running hot in the heads, but only a cold fed by its own 
45 gallon tank. The total water capacity is about 250 gallons. The shower is 
also devised in the interests of economy, fed via a can carried from the sink 
to the heads where the shower is operated by a foot pump.<br>
<br>
The fridge 
is a five cubic feet insulated, top opening, welded, polythene box. It is 
cooled by equipment constantly running from the domestic 24v system, venting 
heat to the sea via an externally mounted heatsink.<br>
<br>
The anchor winch, 
also fitted in 1988 is a 24v 1500w Lofrans. It is supplied by its own set of 
batteries in the forecastle and operated by a pendant on the end of a long 
cable which allows the operator to see over the side of the boat whilst 
operating the winch. The pendant operates one of two 24v relays which supply 
the winch via a 120A thermal fuse. There is 100 metres of 1/2&quot; chain 
shackled to a further 50 metres of regalvanised chain. The anchor normally used 
is a 75lb CQR but there is also a 180lb fisherman for occasional use and a 45lb 
Plastimo CQR used for a kedge/stern anchor.<br>
<br>
<b>Navigation</b><br>
<br>

Navigation items include the following:<br>
 An exterior mounted GPS near the 
wheel with world basemap and interior repeater<br>
 A hydraulic autopilot with 
dedicated fluxgate compass and NMEA links to boat GPS system<br>
 Standalone 
fluxgate compass and speed / log / depth readout<br>
 Navtex weather bulletin 
reciever<br>
<br>
<b>Balast</b><br>
<br>
The balast carried consists of 4 1/2 
tons of lead ingots with a little scrap lead for packing. It is mainly situated 
under the saloon floor, though there is some under the engine room floor.<br>

<br>Lista Light is named after the Lista lighthouse, in Farsund, Norway (see 
red circle on map below)<br>
<br>
It is the last lighthouse in Norway before 
the North Sea, near to the southernmost point of Norway.<br>
<br>
Lista 
Lighthouse was originally built in 1853, and was lit in November, 1836.<br>
 In 
1850, it was suggested that the revolving light at Lista should be replaced by 
three permanent lights for easier identification. Between 1851 and 1852 two 
additional towers identical to the original one were erected.<br>
 At the 
reorganization in 1873, the northernmost tower was kept, while the other two 
were torn down.<br>
 In 1911, the wick lamps were exchanged with petroleum 
incandescent lamps. The lighthouse stands 34 m (112 ft) tall and is 39.5 m (130 
ft) above sea level. Its light reaches 17.5 nautical miles out to sea<br>
<br>

Not that much of interest here, since unfortunately I didn&#146;t get to scan 
many photos from the last 20 years of current ownership, where there were two 
previous trans-atlantic voyages and numerous shorter voyages to France, in 
particular the Brest/Douarnenez festival.<br>

<br>
Before 
the voyage there was a considerable amount of work to be done to get Lista 
Light up to scratch.<br>
 Lista is held together by big dowels of wood which go 
through the planks and into the frames inside, however 70 years on a lot had 
rotted and developed leaks. Plagued by lots of leaky rotted treenails on our 
previous voyage it was decided that it was priority to renew all treenails, 
which involved getting the boat out of the water and drilling and pegging some 
1000 holes.<br>
 Lista Light on the slipway in Bristol Docks<br>
<br>
First the 
treenails needed to be found under the paint<br>
<br>
Then drill out to 32mm<br>
<br>Bash the peg in and use a wedge to open the end out<br>
<br>
A completed 
treenail, ready to be sawn flush, sanded and painted<br>
<br>
 2/3 of one side 
done<br>
<br>
But, a slight drilling error meant removal of the gearbox to get 
the engine exhaust box out to get a hole mended.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, all sorts 
of other things going on - new radar system<br>
<br>
After the treenail holes 
were filled, lots of painting went on - 2 coats everywhere (above the waterline 
undercoat and topcoat, under the water a thick bitumen paint and anti-fouling 
paint to repel worms, barnacles and clingons.<br>
<br>
Paint job complete, 
about to return to the water.<br>
<br>
Only one or two leaky holes (which were 
bodged with half a tube of sticky stuff) - not bad out of 1000 holes.<br>
<br>

The most important job - a touched up nameplate<br>
<br>
Weeks of perpetual 
sanding and varnishing - here the cockpit is getting the treatment<br>
<br>

..and all the floorboards taken out, sanded and varnished<br>
<br>
Finishing 
touches to a new gaff<br>
<br>
The 4.5 tonnes of lead ballast ingots neatly 
stowed in the bottom of the boat, (together with a lot of sweat)<br>
<br>
Our 
posh new sails arrived - and fitted beautifully<br>
<br>

box of tricks<br>
<br>
Then with only 3 weeks to go we decide that the foredeck 
really has to be replaced since it is rotten and leaks like a sieve<br>
<br>
A 
big hole &#133;.<br>
<br>
And the slow process of putting it all back again<br>

<br>Then Jay caulked for hours and Merryn poured pitch on top to seal the seams
<br><br>
A last minute plank and a half replaced - here John is spileing the 
dimensions<br>
<br>
And then we were off ! Everything chucked on deck and 
covered with a tarpaulin in the mad scramble to make it away&#133;.<br>

This website will be a chronicle 
of the adventures of David Lowrie and Katharine Lowrie (nee Land) and their 
lives aboard the good ship Lista Light. Lista Light sails the sea with winds in 
her sails. Solar power, tow generators and wind turbines top up batteries. If 
you would like to contact Dave or Katharine in the meantime, please email us 
and we will respond when next at port!<br>

<br>
<b>GREENING UP OUR 
SHIP!!!</b> <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
This section chronicles our task in preparing a 
tried and tested 50&#146; Wooden Gaff Ketch for the trials of Ocean passages 
and the rigmaroles of sustaining our ethical stance. Everything from canned 
food to engine oil has a strict set of criteria to meet, and where compromises 
have been made it has always been done with a grave heart but an unending 
interest in finding a &#147;better&#148; way. If you have any thoughts or 
suggestions as you read through then please do drop us an email/call &#150; we 
are learning all the time in our approach to the new world of boat living, 
there is no manual.<br>
<br>
<br>
 Our priority is to travel in a sustainable 
and respectful way whilst keeping using a mix of old and new technology to meet 
this goal, safety coming near second, of course. In fact our crew react to a 
mix of astonishment, foreboding and disbelief as Katharine takes new members of 
the crew through the strict recycling procedure well before I have ever 
considered to share the man-over-board drill!<br>
<br>
 As detailed in the 
history section, Lista Light, at a ripe old 70 plus, has seen plenty of action 
in her time and is well equipped already for the voyage. Our task is more 
provisioning and &quot;Greening Up&quot; our ship ready for new adventures and 
keeping the old girl in good condition so she continues to return the favour!
<br><br>
<br>
<b>1. STEAM </b> <br>
<br>
 Diesel. Dirty old diesel. The art of 
sailing in todays crowded waters and busy schedules has been revolutionised by 
the advent of Auxiliary power commonplace in sailing vessels from the 1930s 
onwards. An Engine. It means entering a harbour in any wind condition is 
possible, you can buck the Corryvreken, burry your nose into a storm or press 
on to your favoured destination to meet crew and a pint by 6pm. For this 
convenience there is an obvious environmental cost - the &#147;Iron 
Topsail&#148; on Lista Light is a 6-cyclinder Perkins. With an ample 35 tonnes 
to shift, she drinks a reasonable volume of diesel and that gives us something 
to think about.<br>
<br>
 It seems there are two approaches &#150; abandon the 
engine altogether and return to sails only, or to use the engine in a measured 
and restricted way. Harbours are more crowded these days and it is no 
coincidence that less ships are lost with the ability to avoid tricky rocks, 
so, we decided to take the hit of carrying an engine. To justify this choice 
its worth bearing in mind that the average RNLI Trent lifeboat consumes 500 
litres per hour, one callout and our well meaning gesture would have been 
thoroughly outweighed.<br>
<br>
 Lista Light is not easy to manoeuvre under 
engine in a tight spot never-mind sail. So we minimise its use instead. And for 
that comes frustration but an easy conscience. We spent 4 hours off the Isle of 
Jura doing 0.4kts; 6 hours off Cardigan bay at 1.4kts; high pressure over the 
UK for 4 days meant we stayed in port at Fishguard and got into all sorts of 
trouble with a wee drink instead . . . We look forward to the trade winds!<br>

<br><br>
<br>
With the old Gaffers bible, &quot;Hand, reef and Steer&quot;, by 
Tom Cunliffe in the oil skin pocket, we are starting to master the art of close 
quarters sailing in a very heavy bath tub.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>2. POWER</b> 
<br><br>
 On board power is a major consideration for Lista Light as she has 
grown up from an age of the sextant and the Walker Log to the modern day in 
which Navigational equipments hums, purrs and beeps all around the helm and nav 
station. Gone too are the days of Paraffin navigation lights and saloon 
ambience to the ever-ready supply of electric lighting. The old wooden lathe 
replaced by Mr De Walt. We have brought back the old plane, but we do need 
power to fill the 12 Tractor Batteries on board and whilst we can and 
occasionally do lift the 4okg CQR Anchor up by hand, it&#146;s nice to have the 
odd AMP of helping hand too. Lista needed an upgrade in this respect. She made 
most power via diesel in a handy 5KVA Lister Generator drawing from the diesel 
tanks but with a plethora of micro renewable on offer we went to the drawing 
board with her production capabilities.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Options in the 
Marketplace:<br>
 a. SOLAR<br>
 b. WIND<br>
 c. HYDRO<br>
<br>
<br>
 Most 
modern craft will opt for either wind or solar, we wanted to have a broad 
capability of power production to meet all weather conditions, and to have 
experience of all methods in order to talk and write with authority on this 
topic close to our hearts. So in the end we went for all of it.<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>SOLAR: Recently wedded, we received an extra 20Watt Solar panel from the 
John and Laurie Lowries of the family (oracles on this topic and all others to 
do with life on boats of the vegetative variety &quot; Masters and Commanders 
&quot;Dolphin&quot; of Leith, Scotland) which we have married up with another 
identical panel delivered to Oban, Scotland, to meet our 24v system. With this 
additional 40Watts, and our current 2*30Watts we have 100Watt of solar. Useful, 
as I write today with a cloud laden sky blanketing the beautiful Tobermory, 
Isle of Mull, Scotland. Oh well, head south &#145;til the butter melts as they 
say....<br>
<br>
<br>
WIND/HYDRO: We have good friends Jake and Ruari in the 
wind trade and so getting facts and advice on this was easy. Wherever there is 
sailing there is wind, so its just a matter of selecting the type. Immediately 
it makes sense. Lista Light is a traditional ship and to saddle her with a 
permanent fixture atop the mizzen mast would cause her original builders to 
choke on their rollmops and anything lower makes the device very nickable. We 
instead opted for a temporary structure deployable in the right conditions. So 
we ended up talking to a company called Boost Energy Systems, providers of 
Aquair 100, a generator which can be temporarily suspended up the rigging to 
provide the benefits of elevation whilst mounted in a bracket.<br>
<br>
<br>

<br><br>
 And the real joy of this system was that it could also be deployed as 
a Tow Generator too, which means that on passage we can harness the strong pull 
of Lista Light through the water (with minimal additional drag given her 
sizable dimensions anyway). The Suppliers have put up with my considerable 
interrogation so far and with some parts en route with Lowrie parents, we will 
have a highly adaptable system. Each of the parts are on separate Ammeter 
readers and so we will demonstrate the fact behind the relative contribution of 
the two solar banks and the wind/water generator.<br>
<br>
 I think that the 
Hydro component will prove to be the real provider &#150; hydraulic power being 
far superior to pneumatic. Every modern boat has a propeller that, depending on 
gearbox, can be allowed to serve whilst the boat is in motion, driven by the 
pull through the water. The Aquair 100 systems comes with its own propeller but 
in fact, I believe, could be mounted aside the prop shaft without a significant 
reengineering project.<br>
<br>
<br>
d) THIRD GENERATOR<br>
 We have the Lister 
Generator, the Aquair 100 Generator - Our plan is to harness the third 
generator on board, the Homo Sapiens, lounging on her decks both on passage and 
in the harbour! We have acquired a second hand rowing machine from the our 
Devon mates the Bloomfields and we will rig up a mounting to drive the 
generator to charge the batteries, ridding passengers of pent up energy and 
giving us all a good anaerobic workout!<br>
<br>
<br>
The generator lends 
itself more to a cycle enhancement (we have two bikes on board awaiting 
adaption) but for a full body workout our mission is to link up the rowing 
machine...<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<b> 3. USE LESS </b> <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Use 
Less, not useless. Frugality is king on board all closed systems - a boat is a 
good example of this (as is the world, arguably). Much less sexy than dealing 
with the production side, reducing consumption of limited resources is an 
experience all people should share to understand the impact of their existence. 
I have long been a proponent of helping people understand their consumption 
better in their homes and workplaces- all the technology exists today.<br>
<br>

 a) LEDs for Lighting (Nav lights and reduces Wattage from 20 to 2.6 in some 
cases)<br>
<br>
<br>
b) Hand Pumps for shifting water through our water tanks, 
instead of the MaxiPuppy electric pump, which has rather conveniently died 
anyway. It&#146;s also a fairly strenuous experience which all crew are 
encouraged to undergo to feel the impact of their consumption!<br>
<br>
 c) Hot 
water Solar shower. (Our onboard shower can also be used, but requires filling 
a canister and transporting to the shower rather than plumbing in the shower, 
in the name of economy).<br>
<br>
 d) 24v System instead of 12v &#150; reduces 
the wastage in transporting energy around the boat<br>
<br>
 e) Jumpers. We 
have a diesel gravity fed heater but we do not use this at all, just throw on a 
jumper!!<br>
<br>
 f) Water - no longer a free resource and certainly an energy 
cost in its purification and transport. We have the capacity to take on over 
1000 litres. That lasts us a month with 8 people, which equates to 5 
litres/day/person. Basically, shower when the garlic laced meals require it, a 
teaspoon of water for tooth brushing, mix sea water 30% for boiling soluble 
food stuffs (pasta/rice) and 100% in veg. Oh, and save a bit in case the wind 
doesn&#146;t blow . . . .<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>4. SPA TREATMENT </b> <br>
<br>
<br>

<br>Sadly for the crew, not that type. Anyway - to manage the foredeck you 
can&#146;t mess about with soft hands - bear claws are required, and the dogged 
determination of a dung beetle. This section summarises the changes we are 
planning to the upkeep of the 30 odd tonnes of wet wood we call home. Water in 
wood and wire shortens its lifespan and so mariners for centuries have sought 
ways to protect their steeds from any form of ingress. Traditional methods of 
preservation involved boiling Linseed oil to create a varnish, boiled tar 
(Stockholm Tar) to serve rigging and using naturally tarred Pitch Pine timber 
for construction in the Scandinavian quarters of the world.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
 
Spar Treatment and Rigging slushes have moved on considerably since that time, 
to products that will last several times longer. The problem is that we do not 
know the impact of these products nor the solvents required to thin them that 
we readily fill our harbours with. Our approach is to use naturally occurring 
cures (yes, the old ones) unless in specific treatments, where the structure of 
the boat is in jeopardy (masts, frames). We know there are challenges around 
large scale manufacture of even naturally occurring crops but Linseed seems to 
provide a reasonable sustainable solution and doesn&#146;t suffer from the 
problems of scale that Biofuels do. Any thinking/advice in this respect would 
be appreciated.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>5.PROVISIONING</b> <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

Organismic veg and transporting with pedal power and trailer. Provisioning for 
moving one&#146;s life into a 15m wooden box is a big task. Kat and I left 
ourselves 10 days total. There were high points, the fairly stiff farewell 
drinks and there was the despair of it all at times!<br>
<br>
 Much of the 
transportation was under pedal power including a particularly fraught journey 
across London carrying oars and 100kg of provisions.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
 
Kath and I sourced all of our perishable stocks from local suppliers who have 
become good friends too. These are people who understand sustainable produce 
with respect for the environment and nature. In some cases, contacts Katharine 
has made through RSPB work with Devon&#146;s most progressive farmers in Land 
Management. We left with enough local fruit , veg and meat to keep us going for 
a month or two and with some books on preservation to tackle the ravage of time.
<br><br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
 One of a trio of boxes from Gord the 
Greengrocer&#146;s grapefruits- to stave off the scurvy reported by the Laurie 
Lowries on their voyage to South Africa. It has been interesting to note that 
the organic veg has lasted a lot longer than the usual nasty tasteless 
supermarket carrots people buy! You can find links to their websites in the 
Links section.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>6.WATER CAPTURE</b> <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

Given the number of crew we have to beg, borrow and steal to crash Lista Light 
through the highest of seas on long crossings, we need to seek out constant 
replenishment for our water supplies. We have rigged up a large tarpaulin with 
a hole in the middle, probably 15sqm which acts as an enormous bra and allows 
us to harvest the skies when at harbour. It&#146;s not pretty but it does a 
job. It&#146;s important to let the premier cru go, as the first presse of a 
tarp can be somewhat rich!<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>7.WASHING AND GREENFLY</b> <br>
<br><br>
<br>
Everyone knows the deal with washing liquids, leaching into the 
Norfolk Broads and destroying habitat. We know the damage they can do, but yet 
still they do work superbly well and so they become our guilty pleasures. The 
difference between a house and a boat is that there is no settlement tanks and 
processing between source and water coarse. Katharine is the engine room in 
this respect and I follow her steer. She is fully stocked in Ecover which, 
despite not managing to kill greenfly in a old pest control recipe, seems to do 
an ok job on clothes and dishes. (She gave up with disbelief on the fourth 
attempt at killing greenfly on a plant, borrowed some Ferry Liquid from a 
neighbour and the lot were nuked in an instant!)<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
 (David- 
the renegade, Toad of Toad Hall as he flees prison, disguised as a 
washer-woman). We have a washing machine on board which runs on 30 litres of 
reclaimed solar heated water and then some inverted 240v power which will be 
supplied by the renewable above mentioned. We are a long chalk from going nude 
so this really is the best we can do...!<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>8.GREENING THE 
TENDER</b> <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
We have oars, good old oars! A teaspoon of oil 
can cover a football field on water so using a 2-stroke outboard, where you mix 
the oil into the fuel and discharge the resulting exhaust and sludge 
doesn&#146;t seem like a good idea. We do have a 4-stroke 2HP Honda, but 
it&#146;s just for high winds when our inflatable gets blown around.<br>
<br>

<br><br>
<br>
 We are planning to get a tender capable of making the trips to 
do bird surveys under sail - once I have learned the Spanish for that.<br>
<br>

<br><b>9.COOKING and GAS</b> <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
We are from the northern 
hemisphere and as such have not only a liking for hot food, but also a need to 
break down our hardy fibres in potatoes, parsnips and other such lovelies into 
something slightly more digestible. So we need to cook, and therefore use gas 
on the boat (We do have a BBQ but we do not have many spare dry planks!) . So 
frugality seems the best approach.<br>
<br>
 As always - necessity is the 
mother of all providers as she has been in this case. Having just started to 
get to grips with our own, highly parochial UK system of Propane supply (Flogas 
and Calorgas - homogenous product, same bottle, but never shall the twine meet 
in terms of filling up each others bottles), we landed in the Isle of Man. Manx 
Gas. Same gas, different coloured bottle this time, but no chance of a fill up. 
Ireland - different bottle, same colour, same gas but no way they would fill us 
up. And as the story continued into Spain, except in spain they actually have 
different gas! Butane. &quot;Propano?!&quot;, exclaims costos, crazy English 
people he thinks, &quot;No , solo Butan.&quot;, oh dear. Having exhausted all 
possibilities in Galicia involving our crew trailing gas bottles around in the 
bike trailer, smoking incessantly to test the nerve of passers-by, we have 
opted to fill our existing bottles with butane and live to see if there is any 
material difference except for a few millibars of pressure here or there.<br>

<br><br>
<br>
During this process the realization that we would exhaust our 
supply has led to some good behaviors to take forward. We can use the pressure 
cooker to minimize time (and also preserve) and to date hasn&#146;t quite 
destroyed the veg in a way I&#146;m sure my grandmothers used to. It can also 
withstand a Force 7 without so much as a drip. We have a myriad of recipes for 
cous cous which only requires a quick soak, and I have invested much time in 
trying to find a low wattage cooker to run of the inverted Renewables power but 
so far even the meekest one-slice sandwich toaster takes 750w, in excess of our 
capacity.<br>
 So whatever the weather, wherever in the world, the crew of 
Lista Light still eat well, even if they don&#146;t always sleep well!<br>
<br>

<br><br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
 As mentioned we are starting out on this well 
intentioned voyage to see what alterations we can make to our lives to live in 
a less impactful way. Some of these ideas will be easy to work with and 
implement, others will lead us back to the drawing board but with more 
experience and having had some fun along the way! If you have any old 
wive&#146;s tales or proven wisdom you would like to add to this section then 
please to let us know - we will try almost anything!<br>

<br>
The journey begins with locking out 
of Bristol at 12:40, lots of people waving us off. Through the lock &#133;<br>

<br>An hour down the Avon into the Bristol Channel and wind against tide as 
usual leads to a bumpy beginning with the bowsprit dipping into the water many 
times and sees Josh spending some time dicharging over the rail.<br>
<br>

Arrive at Lundy the next morning to do a few rigging and maintenance jobs and a 
brisk walk up the hill for lunch in the pub. Off again that afternoon having 
set the new sails for the first time for an overnight sail, seeing lots of 
puffins and a school of dolphins swimming along with us for a while. Arriving 
St Marys in the Scillies Monday 12th at 2pm after good progress at up to 7 
knots with the new sails working beautifully..<br>
<br>
 A quick shower in the 
local hotel, a walk around town and a few pints in the Mermaid of course.<br>

<br>Back to the boat for tea and off at 8 headed for France. Usual joy of lots 
of fishing boats and big ships in the shipping lanes at night, and it starts to 
rain a little with some mist obscuring visibility, all thankful for the 
reassurance of our new radar! All is much better in the morning after a good 
breakfast.<br>
<br>
Arrive at Brest after motoring the whole way with no wind 
and a flat sea, just in time for a huge fireworks display.<br>
<br>
Loads of 
pretty boats to look at all around us<br>
<br>
Our first outside crew meal in 
the cockpit<br>
<br>
Last day of the Brest festival (16th July) and the big 
sail-through to Douarnenez, a much smaller and better part of the festival. 
Thousands of boats all around us as we all pile through.<br>
<br>
We managed to 
get the main topsail up for the first time too - and had a day's sailing 
practice the day after tacking and hoisting the sails up and down in some sort 
of order ! Rob was discharged in the dingy for a picture opportunity.<br>
<br>

After leaving our anchorage we decided to go up the river on the other side of 
Douarnenez, where it is a little quieter and we wouldn't need to ferry back and 
forth to shore in the dingy.<br>
<br>
Jay, Noel and Jo returned to the UK to 
complete sorting their lives out, taking with them the injector pump for the 
main engine which had started leaking diesel, and the alternator which was also 
not behaving correctly despite being reconditioned before we left. Rob Merryn 
and Josh had (we thought!) several days to concentrate on the long list of 
outstanding tasks which included a full fuel filter, oil and oil filter change 
for both engines in preparation for the onward journey straight out from 
Douarnenez across Biscay to La Coruna, Spain with our next guest Guy. Jay 
returned bringing the parts back mended a week later, which allowed the engine 
to be started, and we moved out of the precious museum area in the Douarnenez 
river after many threats to 'have us moved' by the officious patron. Despite 
moving only 50 metres, Rob's boat driving skills were not quite up to scratch 
yet and so the journey involved another near bowsprit and wall collision, plus 
about half an hour of attempting to reverse park into a rather large space. In 
the meantime Josh had gone on to Spain with a new aquaintance David sailing on 
his 30ft boat, and Kieth, the boat spider, had began to show signs of wear in 
the sun as his insides started to make an appearance.<br>
<br>
Since Noel and 
Jo were not back now for another week, the multitude of jobs continued, which 
included completion of repainting the heads and fitting a couple of new 
shelves, and fitting of the new GPS near the steering position and many coats 
of varnish on pretty much everything wooden.<br>
<br>
We left Douarnenez on Sat 
7th August for 4 day sail down France across the Bay of Biscay to La Coruna, 
Spain, but there was little wind for a sail as we motored out of the bay - 
something that was due to drastically change over our crossing of the notorious 
Biscay Bay! Guy seemed to be settling in well and got straight on with the job.
<br><br>
Due to the light wind, we put up everything we had, which included the 
first outing of the new mizzen topsail, which went up on a yard which took some 
figuring out!<br>
<br>
Unfortunately the wind was pretty much coming from 
exactly the wrong direction (bang on the nose) when we turned around the corner 
and pointed at La Coruna 286 miles off so we knew that the journey would not be 
easy. After about a day trying to translate the French radio forecasts and 
systematically missing the English versions we managed to get the forecast for 
some strong winds, so we knew we were in for a bumpy ride. The wind and sea 
slowly got up and up and up until we were beating into 10 meter breaking waves 
and force 6-7 winds. Guy started to look a bit green and rushed to the rail 
several times but showed resilience and continued to be useful.<br>
<br>
Click 
on the link below to see a short video which gives some impression of what we 
had for 3 days solid!<br>
<br>
At the height of the storm sereral metal fatigue 
problems confronted us - the cransiron holding the mizzen boom up broke which 
made the boom flap about, with Guy heroically holding onto the sheet rope and 
being dragged along the deck. Everyone rushed out onto deck to get the sail 
down, and after getting everything under control we realised that Noel hadn't 
had time to get his trousers on and had been rushing about the deck in the rain 
and spray in his pants and socks!<br>
<br>
The bowsprit gammon iron holding the 
bowsprit in place also broke, and a G-clamp helped stop the bowsprit bumping 
about for a while, plus a main sheet block fell apart, but all disasters were 
taken in our stride.<br>
<br>
We had been trailing out a fishing line the whole 
way and despite several false catches of sea weed and plastic bags, we finally 
caught a tuna, perfect size for six ! (Thanks for the new fishing gear Merlin!)
<br><br>
We finally made La Coruna at about 1am, and after re-anchoring a 
couple of times finally got some quiet rest, switching the engine off after 90 
hours solid running. It had been a very wearying four days, but the boat and us 
as a team had stood up to everything nature had thrown at us and all was well. 
A good solid breakfast the next morning and we thankfully hit the showers in La 
Coruna.<br>
<br>
After wandering around for a while we decided beer and tapas 
was required, so we all took full advantage of the Spanish hospitality. 
Unfortunately though, Noel ran into his old friend swampy and christened the 
boat that evening as a result. Josh had also joined us to spend a last night on 
board to pick up the rest of his stuff and head for Europe, having decided that 
the sea-faring life was not for him after feeling sick the entire way down to 
Spain in considerably nicer weather the week before.<br>
<br>
After a relaxing 
day recovering from the night before and getting some washing and shopping done 
we left La Coruna the next morning, headed south down the Spanish Rias for a 
series of relaxed day sails in 6 hour hops. First stop was Lage where we spent 
at least five attempts to anchor, dragging the anchor through just about the 
entire anchorage and waking everyone up on the neighbouring boats. Finally we 
held and settled down for the night.<br>
<br>
Next morning an early start on 
towards Ria de Muros, and we finally had some wind that wasn&#146;t coming 
straight at us, so a nice sail ensued around Cape Finnistere and we arrived at 
Muros and put ashore in time to enjoy some Tapas. We realised that we were 
extremely low on diesel, but it was a Saturday and the nearby bunkering station 
wasn&#146;t open until 3pm Monday, which seemed to typify the Spanish&#146;s 
relaxed attitude to work! We used the last dregs of diesel to go on a little 
excursion up the other side of the Ria and then visited Noya, a town supposedly 
dubbed &#145;Spanish Florence&#146; but a slight disappointment except for a 
couple of nice buildings.<br>
<br>
Having taken on water and 1100 litres of 
fuel the next afternoon (showing that the fair Northerly winds expected at this 
time of year to help us sail from France were not necessarily to be relied 
upon) we set off towards Isla Salvora where we stayed the night. After having 
many problems anchoring in the dark we realised that the anchor was badly bent, 
and so had to heft the 180lb fisherman&#146;s anchor overboard instead, an 
enjoyable task to be repeated many times in the next week. After a windy night 
we set off early towards the Isles Cies, some lovely islands to the west of 
Vigo. On the way we were assaulted by rain and very high winds and seas, so 
decided to pull in to Bueu which gave us some welcome shelter and a chance to 
enjoy a quantity of beer in a local bar, followed by a slightly drunken 
shopping trip.<br>
<br>
Next day we arrived at Isla Agudo, the main island of 
the Isles Cies and put ashore for a nice walk around the island along the 
beach. During the walk we spotted a less crowded anchorage off one of the 
smaller islands, Isla St. Martin, and motored around and anchored close to the 
beach in lovely clear water.<br>
<br>
Spotting a rocky hill that looked like it 
needed conquering, we all set off early the next morning before breakfast for a 
two hour climb through brambles and gorse and arrived at the top of the hill 
somewhat scratched and sweaty.<br>
<br>
We spent the rest of the day lazing 
around and had an excellent sail into Vigo, arriving about 6pm and straight off 
to the local bars (after a shower) to celebrate Guy&#146;s last night. Guy 
valiantly finished off the last of the Stella after a fine meal and lots of 
strange alcoholic drinks served from a barrel in jugs and from unlabelled 
bottles in the fridge &#150; luckily none of us were blind the next morning, 
although we did experience some bad headaches and Guy almost missed his train.
<br><br>
Following a recommendation from a chat Jay had with someone at the 
quayside, we set off the following day (after having a day recovering from our 
hangovers, getting some washing and block maintenance done, and finding someone 
to weld up the broken gammon iron) to find &#147;Manolo&#148; at a fishing port 
on the other side of the Ria, who we were told could straighten and reinforce 
our anchor. After little hassle finding the right place, he had a look and 
asked us to return a couple of days later, so we headed off back to the Isles 
Cies to enjoy some beach activity while we waited &#150; the weather had been 
steadily improving over the last day or two and we now had very warm sunny 
weather ahead of us for quite some time.<br>
<br>
After putting in some rock 
climbing, scuba diving, sunbathing and snorkelling and having a generally 
relaxing time it was up at 6am a couple of days later to head back to Manolo 
for the anchor repair, which seemed to go OK.<br>
<br>
We then headed off 
south, keen to get further down and into Portugal towards Lisbon, from where 
Noel and Jo were due to fly back home for a bit for Noel to complete sorting 
his life out and for Jo to do her last month at work.<br>
<br>
Next stop after 
a day&#146;s sail was Viana de Castillo, a very pretty small town where we tied 
up along the harbour wall for the evening and went out to dinner, then another 
day&#146;s sail to Porto which was also very pretty, although time to explore 
the city was limited.<br>
<br>
We were able again to stop on the harbour wall 
after travelling 4 miles up the river, although the entrance to the river was 
quite a ride as the Atlantic swell rose up over a sand bar and threw us about a 
bit, so we headed out at lunchtime the next day at high water and had a much 
better departure. We had several of the fairly frequent but still exciting 
encounters with dolphins, swimming alongside us and around the bow.<br>
<br>
We 
were headed for Aveiro, but ended up doing an all-nighter and arrived in Lisbon 
late Wednesday 26th August, managing to find a spot in the marina where we 
moored on a pontoon and had the benefit of electricity and water nearby. We all 
then had several days of sightseeing in Lisbon and carried on with some of the 
inevitable repairs/jobs to be done; Noel and Jo leave and then there is only 
three!<br>
<br>
Another sad departure from the boat was Keith, whose skin had 
finally given up the fight and had been discharging his stuffing all over the 
place. He was laid to rest in a comfortable looking bin.<br>
<br>
Departing 
Lisbon after a few more days, we headed round the bottom of Portugal and into 
the Algarve, planning to meet Noel at Gibraltar a few weeks later. Although the 
boat is fine to handle with three people, there is obviously less time between 
watches (steering the boat, usually an hour each in turn during the day) and 
not much point in trying to sail overnight, since for safety we usually do 
watches in pairs.<br>
 First anchorage was Sesimbra, then the next evening 
after trying to sail in the light wind with all the sails up we stopped at 
Sines, where we moored up and made use of the washing machine at the marina.<br>
 Next morning we left not long after dawn since we had a fair way to go to the 
next available stopping point, and managed to just catch a thorough soaking 
from a thunderstorm as it rolled over the harbour and followed us out to sea. A 
little while later as the dark clouds cleared and the morning sun came through, 
it gave us a nice chance for some photos, and an idea for a new page on the 
website!<br>
<br>
After escaping the thunderstorm we later rounded the St 
Vincent Cape on the bottom corner of Portugal and anchored off a lovely beach 
at Sagres for that evening and the next day, visiting the fort on the headland 
and even trying some surfing on the beach.<br>
<br>
That night, there was a 
lovely sunset over the Cape that we rounded earlier at the corner of Portugal. 
The little rock off the end is called 'Gigantica'.<br>
<br>
The next couple of 
days saw daytime journeys to Portimao (full of rowdy pink British tourists) and 
on to Faro, having a rare lovely sail with a flat sea and strong but steady 
wind on the beam (from the side). We anchored up the tidal river at Faro where 
there was a large amount of birds on the estuary wetlands, also a nice sunset.
<br><br>
We woke up to loads of fishermen in their little boats fishing all 
around us, and nearly managed to run one of them over on our way out of the 
river - we realised afterwards that he wasn&#146;t suicidal, he was just 
practically blind judging from the thickness of his glasses. As soon as we got 
outside the river, we were straight into sea fog, our first really thick patch 
since leaving Britain. Since fog usually burns off fairly quickly in the 
morning, we carried on thankful to the radar system that we fitted before 
leaving!<br>
After the fog eventually cleared after lunch, the wind and sea 
remained calm so we just motored on to outside El Rompido where we stayed that 
evening, and motored through the next calm day into the mouth of the 
Guadalquivir river where we anchored in the riverbank.<br>
<br>
The run up the 
river, some 55 miles, could be accomplished with the help of the tide in about 
6 hours if caught right, so we went off with the tide in the morning, through 
very hot, still weather all day and arrived outside Seville in late afternoon. 
Used to the usual sea breeze, we were hot in Seville as the weather reached 40 
degrees!<br>
<br>
Having made it through the big lock into the Seville docks 
and dodged the container ships we came to a swing bridge which as far as we 
were aware, would lift up to let us go underneath. In the end we had to wait 
two and a half hours for it to open, since it only opened at a certain time 
every two days&#133;eventually we moored at the Seville yacht club, where we 
stayed for five days mostly due to the three swimming pools to choose from!<br>

Unfortunately, certain crew members were not allowed ashore before they tidied 
their bunks&#133;.<br>
<br>
The usual mixture of maintaining the boat and 
sightseeing ensued - Merryn painted the side of the boat, Jay repainted and 
cleaned the F'castle and Rob put on the guard rails, useful in stopping people 
falling over the side.<br>
 There are things that you have to see in Seville - 
the massive cathedral and the Alcazar, a beautiful tiled palace with extensive 
grounds.<br>
<br>
We finally pulled ourselves away from the swimming pools and 
set off back down the river from Seville, going out through the bridge at the 
only available time of 8pm. We thought it might be a good idea to go on through 
the lock and anchor in the river in order to get an early start the next day, 
but light was failing and we ended up having a few close shaves with the 
sharply sloping river bank in the dark, actually getting stuck aground for a 
while, and having to pull ourselves off with the anchor (which was dropped into 
the middle of the channel by dinghy); we had to do this before the tide went 
down any further and left us high and dry!<br>
We finally anchored safely back 
near the lock three hours later.<br>
The next morning we were up early to catch 
the tide down the river, spotting some flamingos feeding in the mud on the way, 
and stopping again near the nature reserve at the bottom in the afternoon. We 
went ashore to try to spot the infamous feral camels, but all we saw were wild 
horses, some deer and lots of mosquitoes that decided to eat us alive. We had a 
barbeque on deck that evening, hoping that the smoke would keep them at bay.<br>
The next morning we were off again in a South Easterly direction down the coast 
towards Gibraltar, unfortunately we were lacking a small scale chart of this 
particular area past Cadiz, so we stayed well off shore just in case, making 
our journey a little longer. Going round Cape Trafalgar towards Barbate, our 
scheduled stop for the night, the sea was extremely bumpy, reminding us of our 
Biscay crossing, although once round the cape, we headed into Barbate in 
slightly calmer sea.<br>
<br>
After a few beers and a decent night&#146;s sleep 
we headed for Tarifa and on the way had our first sight of the Atlas mountains 
on the North African coast. A &#145;Levanter&#146; is the gale that sometimes 
blows out of the Mediterranean Sea through the Gibraltar Strait and with our 
usual luck we found ourselves beating into both some version of this wind and a 
strong current flowing against us &#150; so the easy twenty miles ended up 
taking us six hours, with the engine going full tilt!<br>
<br>
When we left 
Tarifa the next morning, this time trying to time our departure with the 
current, there was a beautiful sunrise over the African coast.<br>
<br>
We 
arrived in Gibraltar that early afternoon after dodging the huge cruise ships 
and tankers in the busy bay, and settled into a berth at one of the marinas 
after visiting the customs dock (back to British red tape.) It was strange to 
see British road signs, Marks &amp; Sparks, bobbies on the beat, etc. but to 
have lovely hot weather at the same time. We were even more pleased to see 
cheap duty free booze and fags and to visit Tesco&#146;s and re-discover the 
special British items such as Marmite &amp; Coffee Mate that we hadn&#146;t 
seen for some time..<br>
 Rob was also most pleased to find that the harbour 
had a broadband wireless internet connection, so he could sit in the cockpit 
and do the website update (geek!)<br>
<br>
The day after our arrival saw the 
return of Noel back on the scene after flying in to Malaga and getting a bus on 
to Gibraltar. A few days of the usual wandering about trying to find parts and 
the purchase of a couple of new batteries, a 'Navtex' weather forecast receiver 
amongst other things, and the fitting of a new gearbox coupling brought from 
England with Noel, which then required several mornings' work making and 
fitting shims to align the engine properly with the prop shaft.<br>
 We decided 
to spend the next day climbing the Gibraltar rock, and enjoyed the views from 
the top of the harbour that we were in.<br>
<br>
Having reached the top after a 
few hours of climbing we enjoyed watching the famous monkeys &#133;<br>
<br>

and walked along the ridge, with the cloud billowing over the top from the 
Mediterranean side of the rock.<br>
<br>
Since it was Jay's birthday, ice 
creams (the larger the better) were in order.<br>
<br>
A few days later Jay 
left to fly back to England for a couple of weeks, planning to meet us back at 
Faro at the same time as Jo to continue on to Madeira. Having carried on with 
the boat maintenance jobs for a couple of days, we decided to leave the marina 
and go to anchor outside, a much cheaper option - unfortunately in the meantime 
the marina staff had decided that our boat was longer than we had said (there 
are several ways to state the length of a boat) and had doubled the price 
without telling us to &pound;20 a day. A large argument ensued, but to no avail 
since we had already paid by mistake so there was nothing to do but express our 
dissatisfaction with their underhand tactics as we left.<br>
 Maurice had 
decided to pop out for a week to sail with us round to Faro, so after he flew 
in the next day, we left Gibraltar the day after and had a good sail around 
back to Tarifa, with the 'Levanter' wind blowing the right way this time. 
Maurice took to the helm quickly, as good as any single-handed sailor!<br>
<br>

We went to anchor off the leeward side of Tarifa as we had done last time, 
although the wind was blowing off shore, the waves were travelling down the 
coast and driving onshore, so we went back around and into the small harbour 
and tied up alongside. By the morning the wind was very strong, gusting through 
the relatively protected harbour, so we gingerly nosed out of the harbour into 
a blast of wind and high waves - this time though the waves and the wind were 
both going our way so with just a double-reefed mainsail we managed a speedy 
9.5 knots !<br>
<br>
We made such good progress that we decided to carry on 
around Cape Trafalgar and up to Cadiz that day - rounding Cape Trafalgar was 
very different zooming along with the wind and sea, rather than beating against 
it as we had done last time. By the time we reached Cadiz it was about 10pm and 
we finally arrived in the fairly industrial looking port as recommended by our 
pilot book, and tied up alongside a disused looking rusty boat. Half way 
through cooking a belated supper we heard a shout, and a maritime police boat 
was alongside, with its occupant telling us that we could not moor there since 
the area was private, and that we had to go five miles across the bay to Porto 
Sherry where there was a marina. We finally arrived there at 11:30 and stayed 
the night, leaving the next morning onwards again to the mouth of the 
Guadalquivir river. Lacking any favourable wind, we motored along all day, our 
path crossed by some scary looking destroyers.<br>
<br>
We anchored a couple of 
miles up the river mouth, leaving plenty of time for a small wander in the 
reserve, again missing a sighting of the illusive feral camels, although we did 
get shooed off by a very important ranger in a jeep waving his finger at us, 
and we saw some fisherman waiting for the ferry across to the town on the other 
side of the river.<br>
<br>
The bay near the river mouth has a wreck of a huge 
boat, torn in half, as a stark reminder of the dangers to shipping.<br>
<br>
We 
rounded the evening off with a barbie in the dark on deck.<br>
<br>
The next 
day we had wind on the nose again so we motored all the way to Santo Antonio, 
at the mouth of the Gaudiana river (at the Spain / Portugal border), and 
anchored off the beach. We went ashore and wandered around the pleasant little 
town, having a very good seafood meal at a restaurant. The next morning we 
returned to town and spent some time on the beach and had a swim, while Noel 
did some maintenance.<br>
<br>
After re-shimming the engine for the fourth time 
and finally getting the alignment right, we left mid afternoon for the Faro 
river, arriving at the river mouth at about 7:30 in the dark. We thought it 
looked a bit bumpy but as we tried to go through the river entrance we were 
assautled by a vast torrent of current coming out and making all sorts of weird 
eddies and standing waves up to siz foot tall. At one point it took us and 
swept us along sideways despite full lock on the rudder, but judicious 
application of full blast from the trusty Perkins main engine sorted us out and 
got us through. We then carried on a bit up the river and anchored outside the 
channel, feeling sorry for the much smaller sailing boat that came in behind us 
and got stuck in the entrance being thrown about for about 10 minutes, lacking 
the engine power to make much progress.<br>
 The next morning we carried on up 
the river and anchored near the town, spotting our 'twin' boat (well, hull 
shape at least) on the way.<br>
<br>
Since Maurice was to leave from Faro 
airport that evening, we went into town and checked out the bus times, pausing 
for lunch in the town and a small walk to the older part of town.<br>
<br>

Having said farewell to Maurice that evening, we weighed anchor the next 
morning and made our way around to Villamoura, where we had previously been 
able to get gas. Our four gas propane cylinders that we keep on deck for the 
cooker and the boiler were almost spent, and various problems with different 
cylinder owners and fittings in each country mean that rather than just 
swapping cylinders, we have to have our own cylinders sent away to be refilled 
for us, which cannot be done in many places. After a smooth run down the river 
and out to sea, we arrived at Villamoura that afternoon and moored up alongside 
a pontoon in the large marina. The next couple of days were spent finshing off 
a load of jobs and getting the boat ready for the next part of the voyage, 
these included amongst other things the sanding and varnishing of the rubbing 
strake that was fitted in a bit of a hurry just before we left, and finally 
getting around to installing the Navtex weather receiver bought in Gibraltar.
<br><br>
The 6th October saw Jay arrive bringing Ian, and Jo arriving later on 
in the evening. Unfortunately departure the next morning was delayed until the 
afternoon after some repairs to the top of the main mast were carried out, a 
problem only noticed the day before, but when we got out to sea we had a good 
run back to Sagres, arriving just after dark and anchoring off the beach.<br>

<br>During the night the sea and wind got up considerably and so at first light 
we went around the headland into Baleira, a protected anchorage where we 
were'nt going to be swept onto the shore, and waited the day out until the next 
morning until the weather was a little better. Meanwhile, there was some time 
to try being battered by the 8-foot waves every ten seconds on the beach.<br>

<br>The next morning we headed out into the still strong but much less 
dangerous wind and sea off towards Porto Santo, allowing us to sail well for 
the first day or two, but the wind gradually died, leaving us motoring for a 
day, but picked up again on the fourth day and we sailed up to Porto Santo on 
the morning of the 13th.<br>
<br>
We stayed in the harbour at anchor in Porto 
Santo for a couple of days, giving us time to go for a walk around the island, 
spend some time on the beach and go out for a meal on both nights as a treat.
<br><br>
 On Friday 15th we upped the hook and went across to Madeira, covering 
the 30 miles mostly under engine since despite a good try, the sails would not 
fill in the light breeze. We anchored right at the North end of the island in a 
little bay, with wonderful rock formations to look at.<br>
<br>
We had a lovely 
home-made coffee and walnut cake as a treat, expertly made by Noel and Jo which 
went down a treat after a brisk swim to the shore and back.<br>
<br>
The next 
day we left just after lunchtime to go round to a marina in Funchal, the 
capital of Madeira, leaving just enough time to go for a walk on the bare rocky 
hills surrounding the anchorage.<br>
<br>
Funchal was only a few hours sail 
away so we arrived well before nightfall at the harbour, which is a fairly 
large commercial port with a small and very well filled marina. Having been 
shooed away by someone in the marina after hovering for a while in the entrance 
looking in vain for a suitable space, we went outside the marina to anchor and 
went into town to sample some of the local flavours.<br>
<br>
The next day we 
went off to do a 'Lavada' walk in the hills (a lavada is a water channel cut 
into the side of the hills to collect and transport rainwater to the towns). 
Despite a few wrong turns at the start which led to over an hours' walking in 
the wrong direction (the 15-year old guide book that we had was no longer the 
most accurate) we walked most of the day following the lavada paths and taking 
in the wonderful scenery.<br>
<br>
As the day wore on the weather deteriorated 
and we returned back to the boat in torrential rain. The wind got up and with 
the Navtex warning a force 8 and the boat rolling around in the anchorage which 
was not too well protected we went over and tied up alongside the wall in the 
commercial port, assisting some tired Germans who had just arrived after a 
nasty voyage from Porto Santo by letting them tie up alongside us. In the 
morning we were predictably moved on by the port authority who gave us the 
option of paying 400 euros to stay there another day, which we politely 
declined, and we re-anchored where we had been before. The weather was still 
pretty ugly and each time we went ashore we were drenched by the rain, and we 
had a bumpy night with the boat rolling around all over the place.<br>
<br>
The 
next evening Jo's brother Chris was arriving as a surprise to sail with us to 
the Canaries, so Jo was very pleased to see him, and since no-one could be 
bothered to cook another bar meal ensued. Due to leave the next morning, the 
wind was still blowing hard and the waves looked huge, so we sensibly decided 
to wait until conditions were more pleasant to leave for the Canaries. We 
discovered that the Lister generator had managed to flood itself with sea water 
so Rob had the enjoyable task of several hours oily work clearing out the sump 
and the engine and replacing the oil, but all was OK afterwards. Merryn made a 
'tingle' (a copper patch) to cover a rotten part of planking which was letting 
in water and Noel, Chris and Jo fixed it on the side. Meanwhile the hapless 
Germans, who had been forced out into the less protected end of the anchorage 
by the port authority moaning that there was not enough room for the big cargo 
boats to get past everyone, had been dragging their anchor and picked up a 
mooring buoy, but in the meantime had got another mooring buoy rope stuck 
around their propellor, and so were pretty much stuck where they were until the 
weather improved.<br>
<br>
The weather had abated a bit by the evening and so 
we prepared that night to leave at first light the next morning by putting a 
couple of reefs in the sails. 6:30am saw us all about and we weighed anchor for 
Santa Cruz de Tenerife at about 7.<br>
<br>
Even though the wind had abated to 
a good sailing strength of 5-6 the waves were still pretty large and we had a 
bumpy ride for the first day. After a promising start the waves took their toll 
on Chris' stomach and his lunch was spotted more than once.<br>
<br>
During the 
night the wind decreased even more, eventually requiring some help from the 
engine. The waves followed suit during the course of the next day, and by the 
afternoon the swell was no longer choppy and the water took on a smooth 
appearance. Chris, now fully recovered, slung his tree hammock under the 
bowsprit and releaxed in the gentle swinging motion.<br>
<br>
The relaxed 
atmosphere finally allowed the sextant to come out and Jay and Ian took several 
measurements, followed by several hours of calculation, and finally announced 
that they had worked out our position to within some ten miles, which was 
surprisingly accurate.<br>
<br>
Since we were going fairly slowly, Noel and 
Chris decided that it was time for a swim and jumped into the ocean, with a few 
km of water below them. They then tied a rope onto the boat and enjoyed being 
pulled along for a while behind us.<br>
<br>
We even caught a fish, and here 
Noel demonstrates the headless catch, body builder style.<br>
<br>
The next 
morning we neared Tenerife and pulled into a small bay off the east coast, and 
spent a relaxed day swimming and snorkelling around the boat.<br>
<br>
Jo, Noel 
and Chris took the dingy and went to explore some caves on the side of the bay, 
managing to find a way through to the other side.<br>
<br>
Later on that 
afternoon, Merryn and Rob had a small incident trying to get the dingy off the 
beach and give a lift to someone back to their boat, which involved in some 
injuries to the passenger who couldn&#146;t get into the boat quickly enough to 
get clear of the waves in time. We ended up towing him back to his boat on the 
surfboard ! After the entertainment at the beach, we left the bay and went back 
towards Santa Maria, the capital of Tenerife and arrived at the marina a few 
hours later. Since it was both Chris' and Ians' last night, we went out for a 
meal together.<br>
<br>
Having seen Chris and Ian off to return home, Rob and 
Merryn began to have an idea about escaping for a week and popping back to 
Blighty to say hello to the chaps, and went to the airport and found a flight 
for the next day (you need a holiday even when on holiday!). Meanwhile Caren, 
Jo's mother, arrived the next day and after a night on board, the reduced party 
of four set off towards Gomera, one of the smaller Canary Islands.<br>
<br>

After an eventful start to the journey (lifting the neighbour's anchor with 
ours!) we had little luck with the wind, which was predictably on the nose as 
we headed south.The sun was going down as we arrived in the anchorage at Los 
Cristianos, when the next anchor event happened. In trying to pull up on our 
dragging anchor we got the dinghy painter round the prop! Noel jumped in and 
cut it free quickly, hoping not many others had seen our schoolboy error. All 
turned out fine, and we enjoyed a calm evening under the stars with a bright 
full moon.<br>
<br>
The following day we set off for San Sebastian marina on La 
Gomera. We had a lovely sail for 5 miles in slightly the wrong direction, then 
had to tack back towards the island.<br>
<br>
We were very excited to come 
across a small pod of pilot whales, who swam towards and under the boat.<br>

<br>After an easy set down against a wall in the marina, we had a relaxed 
evening. The next day we explored the pretty town of San Sebastian, which has 
close links with Columbus, who said Mass in the Church of Our Lady of the 
Assumption before setting off from here to discover the Americas.<br>
<br>
The 
island is said to be one of the prettiest of the Canaries, and exploring inland 
is a must. We hired a car and headed towards the almost central peak, which is 
surrounded by national park. The continuous hairpin bends climb up through 
constantly changing scenery, offering stunning views (if you dare take your 
eyes off the road!). Impressive Mt Teide on Tenerife provides the backdrop most 
of the way.<br>
<br>
We had to set off back to Tenerife the next day, although 
we could have enjoyed Gomera for longer but we needed meet Rob and Merryn on 
their return, and get Caren to the airport. We were able to sail nicely under 
the main with 2 reefs for a couple of hours, the wind then dropped and was 
right on the nose as we turned the corner to head up Tenerife east coast to 
Santa Cruz. Luckily we had another encounter with pilot whales, who cruised 
beside us for a while. It made for a long day, beating into the oncoming sea 
but we got into Santa Cruz late evening.<br>
Rob and Merryn returned safely the 
next day and Caren was sad to have to catch her flight the following day.<br>

<br>Final preparations were then under way for the 10 day trip to Cape Verdes, 
including meeting our new crew member Bernardo and the slightly later addition 
of Cezar. Everyone was looking forward to the change in culture and getting a 
taste of Africa.<br>
<br>
It takes a surprising amount of food and beer to feed 
seven people for a couple of weeks. In fact, it took us over &pound;500 worth 
of shopping! When the fresh meat runs out after three or four days (we have a 
fridge but no freezer) , with the salad and veg not that long after we have to 
get a bit more creative with our cooking, but things like cheese and vacuum 
packed meats last for several months in the fridge which makes our diet not 
quite vegetarian. There is of course also fresh fish, when we are lucky enough 
to catch some.<br>
 Although there is local fresh African type veg and some 
meats available in the Cape Verde Islands for a final fresh stock up before the 
main Atlantic crossing, we weren't too sure about the selection of other foods 
such as tinned ingredients that would be available - there was not much ten 
years ago the last time Lista Light visited. Food in general is also more 
expensive in the Caribbean, so it is worth buying as much as you can whilst 
still in Europe. We hired a car for the day, and did three trips to a massive 
supermarket - below is the result of the first trip laid out ready to be stowed 
away - some fresh juice and a few tins.<br>
<br>
The new lads were roped in and 
helped prepare the boat and get everything ready - Bernardo is a Portuguese 
musician who has done some sailing before, but on more modern boats, and Cesar, 
a Spaniard, is a learner by sailing standards. Since, by day sailing standards 
(with a new place to stop most nights) a long voyage is fairly boring from a 
narrative point of view, the next part is in the vague format of a diary.<br>

<br><b>6th November</b><br>
At 1pm we untied the boat, hauled up the anchor and 
headed off out of the Santa Cruz de Tenerife harbour and down the side of the 
island, before we could turn and head for the Cape Verde islands. Although the 
wind was light and blowing from the South (our course was SSW when we turned 
the corner after Tenerife) we put the staysail and mainsail up mostly for 
entertainment and to show the new crew the ropes. As the wind slowly died 
overnight, we took the sails down and motored onwards. The lights of El Hiero, 
the last Canary Isle on the way south, refused to go out and were still visible 
by dawn the next morning way astern.<br>
<br>
<b>7th November</b><br>
 At 
lunchtime the wind picked up a bit and so up went all the sails, unfortunately 
there was still not enough wind to turn the engine off, although we reduced the 
revs to a fast tickover just to help us make progress through the water; if 
there is not enough speed then steering becomes difficult and the boat tends to 
roll around in the waves. The prevailing Trade Winds in this area should be a 
northeasterly at this time of year, perfect for pushing us in a southwesterly 
direction, but our bad luck continued with the wind blowing from the south 
south west which was pretty much right where we wanted to go. After some light 
showers late that afternoon the sky cleared and the stars were out in force, 
which makes a night sail much more interesting.<br>
 When sailing 24 hours a 
day, we split the watches so that everyone does various 'shifts' with various 
people. With seven people, our watch system works out as follows: 21h-01h : 3 
people. 01h-04h : 2 people. 04h-07h : 2 people. The remaining 14 hours of 
daylight are split equally between everyone i.e.. 2 hours each.<br>
So, a 
typical rota for someone would be steering 5-6pm, off until woken up at 1am, 
then on watch for 3 hours (sharing steering with a partner) until 4am, then 
back to bed until next slot at 10-11am, then another slot in the afternoon 
2-3pm. What with at least two square meals a day to cook and wash up after, and 
often an amount of pulling of ropes in between, it's amazing how quickly time 
goes.<br>
<br>
<b>8th November</b><br>
 Still sailing into the wind, 
unfortunately often at right angles to the direction that we want to go in 
since Lista doesn't sail very close to the wind. Although the wind is quite 
strong, we are only going about 3-4 knots since we are tacking into it, with a 
good heel over which makes moving about and cooking pretty interesting.<br>
<br>
That evening, we shortened sail for the night since the wind strength was 
rising, by putting up a smaller jib and reefing the main and mizzen sails. At 
about 11pm it was decided that the mainsail needed to come down since there was 
really quite a lot of wind, which is a fairly entertaining thing to wrestle 
with at night, but all went well. When sailing at night we all wear safety 
harnesses with a fairly short lanyard that clips into a rail so that we can 
move around up and down the deck, but still be tied on safely.<br>
 Both 
Bernardo and Cesar turned out to willing and enthusiastic both on the boat in 
general but also in the galley, and readily joined in with the healthy 
competition of the daily cooking chores, bringing a tasty Portuguese and 
Spanish touch!<br>
<br>
<b>9th November</b><br>
 By the morning rain had 
settled in and we were fairly wet and miserable by the time dawn broke, and the 
sky was overcast and showery all day. We managed, through our tacking about, to 
go over Endeavor Bank, an underwater mountain that rises from the 3500m deep 
plain to just 150m, which resulted in some very confused and choppy seas and a 
fair bit of being thrown about for a short time. Towards the end of the day the 
wind dropped again, and the engine helped drive us onwards.<br>
<br>
<b>10th 
November</b><br>
 We finally gave up trying to tack into the wind (since for 
every 20 miles covered we were making only a couple in the right direction) and 
took the sails down, motoring along and making good progress towards our 
destination. After battering into the sea with all the sails up we were making 
a little more water than normal so we investigated under the floor and 
discovered a few leaks where the force of the sea had opened some seams up 
between planks. We made a few running repairs by attaching some tingles to the 
worst three leaks from the inside, which stemmed the flow.<br>
<br>
It was also 
a good day for fishing - we managed to catch two Dorado, which made for a 
lovely Portuguese peasant fish dish cooked by Bernardo.<br>
<br>
<b>11th 
November</b><br>
 Passed the Tropic of Cancer 09:50am, and a sacrificial 
offering of some flowers to Neptune in the vain hope of some favourable wind, 
although we were to see none that day, and motored on as usual; even the wind 
against us died and all was calm.<br>
<br>
We suddenly spotted a pod of whales 
(we think they were pilot whales since they were fairly small) and slowly 
approached them to have a look, and a pod of dolphins also arrived to join in 
the fun. Unfortunately the whales only lifted the odd fin out of the water, so 
no good pictures, but the dolphins as usual came much closer.<br>
<br>
Lacking 
any good wind, we continued motoring the rest of the day and all through the 
night.<br>
<b>12th November</b><br>
 Having stopped the engine in the morning 
to change the engine oil, we finally had a chance to turn it off for several 
hours in the afternoon, as a good strength wind picked up from astern, and we 
got all the sails up - we had a four hours of beautiful sailing at 7 knots 
before the wind died again, and the engine had to be switched on that evening.
<br><br>
<b>13th November</b><br>
The day dawned still and hot, and by 
lunchtime we all needed a dip in the ocean (which had climbed to a beautifully 
warm 28 degrees centigrade) so we dragged a rope behind us and most of us 
jumped in and got pulled along by the rope. Many attempts were made to use the 
surfboard as a water ski, but only Noel managed to stand up and do some slow 
motion water ski-ing.<br>
<br>
<b>14th November</b><br>
 The final full day of 
our voyage, and finally we get a good trade wind behind us, and sailed well all 
day. The sea was also fair to us - we reeled in another Dorado for supper, and 
as night fell, we could see the glow of lights off the Cape Verde islands, but 
had a beautiful sunset first.<br>
<br>
<b>15th November</b><br>
 We arrived at 
Mindela harbour, on the island of Sao Vincente at about 10:30am, and anchored.
<br><br>
The island had changed a lot since Lista last visited ten years ago, 
but most of the changes were for the better as people seemed less 
poverty-stricken. We had a pleasant time sampling the local sugar cane spirit 
called 'Grogue', shopping in the market and relaxing on the beach, although 
Noel and Jay spent a couple of days diving under the hull and searching for and 
repairing leaks.<br>
<br>
Wer'e planning to leave on Saturday 20th to cross the 
Atlantic, hope to be in Antingua around the 6th December.<br>
<br>
The beach 
activity continued in Cape Verde, and we made an excursion to San Pedro, where 
there was reported to be some surf. When we arrived, the beach was pleasant and 
deserted, but the waves were breaking very near the shore; however there was a 
good wind and the boys had fun being dragged along the beach by Rob&#146;s 
kite. Bernardo, however, managed to catch a few waves perilously close to the 
rocks and showed Rob what he should be doing with his surfboard.<br>
<br>
After 
the usual entertainment of filling up with diesel and water, the haggling over 
fresh fruit and veg prices in the Cape Verde markets (helped no end by the 
Portuguese language capabilities of our new crew members), plus the lugging of 
all the provisions and ten cases of lager to the boat in the heat, much was 
prepared by the evening of Friday 19th for our departure the next day, and an 
attempt was made to finish the last of our Cape Verde money off on a meal and a 
few beers at the Club Nautico, where a band was playing.<br>
<br>
<b>20th 
November</b><br>
 We paid off our &#145;boat boy&#146; Orlando with some spare 
rope, some second hand clothes and a little cash for his doubtful services in 
&#145;looking after our dingy while we were ashore&#146;, picked up 50 rolls of 
fresh bread, stowed everything in it&#146;s proper place, hauled the dingy 
aboard and weighed anchor at midday, saying goodbye to the Cape Verde islands, 
headed for Antigua some 2050 miles distant due west. By this time of year the 
north westerly trade winds should be fairly well established and reliable, so 
we hoped to have a good run most of the way there with the wind behind us.<br>

<br>We made good progress that afternoon until the wind died was not enough to 
keep the sails filled as the boat rolled, so down they came and on went the 
engine that evening. We had started to blame the ship&#146;s parrot (who is 
purported to be the source of the ship&#146;s luck) for the continuous 
unfortunate wind that we were experiencing.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>21st November</b>
<br> Whilst at the helm overnight, Merryn was lucky enough to be hit in the 
back of the head by a flying fish which is a fairly scary event when half 
asleep &#150; Noel came up from the chart table having heard several screams 
thinking Merryn had fallen overboard. The fishy theme to the day continued with 
Noel bagging a fairly large Dorado early morning, so it was fresh fish cooked 
in lemon and garlic for lunch.<br>
The other marine event of the day was 
passing a massive turtle, almost 2 metres long, which seemed just as interested 
in us as we were in it when we turned around for a look.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>22nd 
November</b><br>
 A big day &#150; not only Jo&#146;s birthday but Merryn and 
Rob&#146;s 6 month wedding anniversary, and a full year since England won the 
rugby world cup final. Noel provided a celebratory drink of champagne and 
orange juice with breakfast, and Jo was given a variety of presents, some that 
Noel had hidden since Gibraltar, and some that he had made onboard, like this 
hair grip.<br>
<br>
Merryn cooked a special chocolate brownie cake which was 
enjoyed by all.<br>
<br>
We were very successful on the fishing front, catching 
a total of five Dorado, unfortunately they were all quite small so back they 
went.<br>
<b>23rd November</b><br>
The morning started with the biggest catch 
yet, reeled in by Cesar and Noel.<br>
<br>
Noel enjoyed himself for a while 
playing around with fishy bits.<br>
<br>
As it was so hot, we jumped into the 
sea to cool down and grabbed onto a rope to get pulled along behind. Cesar 
suddenly spotted a fin in the water which he thought looked like a shark, and 
there has never been such a quick exit by all from the water! Luckily the 
visitors were dolphins, and we had a lovely time swimming around with them for 
half an hour, Rob even managing to touch a couple of them by leaning off the 
bow of the boat under the bowsprit, and Cesar had a good go but wasn&#146;t 
lucky.<br>
<br>
We were still motoring along since the wind had died the night 
after leaving the Cape Verdes, with nothing but very light wind from astern 
which was not enough to fill the sails properly as the boat rolled. The first 
of several inventive sail plans was put up &#150; a bermudan triangular sail in 
place of the usual gaff mainsail, which flapped around less than the usual gaff 
mainsail, but was still not enough to turn the engine off.<br>
<br>
 The Dorado 
caught earlier made a lovely Portuguese fish dish cooked by Bernardo.<br>
<b>
24th November</b><br>
 Still no wind to speak of, but a slight freshening from 
the north helped us along a little faster with the engine turned right down. 
The calm environment and smooth sea gave plenty of opportunity for relaxation 
and guitar practice.<br>
<br>
The fishing run of ten Dorado in a row was broken 
by Rob catching a fish we later identified as a Wahoo, although he was quite 
small (not exactly the 2 metres in length that they can grow up to) so he went 
back in. Whilst the decision was made to not keep him for dinner, Rob held onto 
his tail - watch the rivetingly exciting action in this small clip.<br>
<br>

<br><b>25th November</b><br>
Despite a slight improvement during the night, 
there was nothing but the lightest of zephyrs in the morning, which encouraged 
the next sail configuration &#150; a squaresail hoisted on a yard. 
Unfortunately it looked very ugly and makeshift (which it was) and didn&#146;t 
do a thing. Here Jay is proudly standing in front of her creation.<br>
<br>
The 
lack of good sailing (or indeed anything else vaguely interesting to report for 
the day) allowed us to concentrate even more on our stomachs than usual &#150; 
Spanish omelette and Portuguese fisherman&#146;s bread for lunch followed by 
vegetable massala curry and home-made chapattis for dinner.<br>
<br>
Merryn 
dealt with a bag of chillies so that they would hang up and dry out, and stop 
going mouldy.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>26th November</b><br>
At last, our prayers were 
answered and we were able to turn the engine off for the first time in five 
days and sail well all day, making very good progress at up to 7 knots.<br>
<br>
Of course, there is always a balance and the wind got stronger and stronger all 
day until we had to reduce sail by the evening, still making 6-7 knots under 
double reefed mainsail. We had the rare pleasure of seeing another sailing boat 
that night, who came up behind us and overtook us about a mile off. Jay chatted 
to them on the VHF radio, and asked him for any news on the weather.<br>
<b>
27th November</b><br>
 The weather took a turn for the worse, with a good 
quantity of lightening and rain showers in the morning, finally culminating in 
the wind veering round to ahead of us, a which point after trying to make some 
progress, we took the sails down and motored straight into the weather for the 
best part of the day. The wind then backed around to the south, and by 9pm we 
had the engine off again and were going along nicely, which is how it stayed 
for the night, illuminated brightly by the full moon.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>28th 
November</b><br>
A good days sailing, a steady 5 knots all day with a good bit 
of sunshine and nothing whatsoever of interest to report.<br>
<br>
Rob got down 
to work and spent a portion of the day writing this very internet update &#150; 
after a complaint that there were no photos to use, Noel took this particularly 
arty shot (almost worthy of the &#145;arty pictures&#146; section!) through a 
porthole<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>29th November</b><br>
 The day started with squalls, 
torrential rain and gusts of wind, followed by dead calm which was to be the 
weather recipe for the next few days. In a particularly wet moment after 
daybreak most of us had a &#145;shower&#146; on deck, with the clouds providing 
the warm water. Having passed the halfway point (1025 miles done, 1025 miles to 
go) at 09:30, we had a fantastic afternoon of sailing despite the rain, and we 
made over 7 knots for several hours.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>30th November</b><br>

Continuing the strange and variable weather of the day before, we again made 
very good progress at up to 8 knots in the strong wind. Just before lunch we 
heard an exhaling sound and realised that a pod of whales about ten metres long 
had come to see us, and they swam around and under the boat for ten minutes, 
occasionally breaking the surface to breathe, although they didn&#146;t perform 
for the camera.. The good sailing didn&#146;t last too long though, and it was 
back to dead calm and the engine on that evening.<br>
<b>1st December</b><br>

We managed to run for some of the day with twin headsails, something we had 
intended for most of the journey if the trade winds had blown correctly!<br>

<br><br>
<b>2nd-5th December</b><br>
Unsettled weather was the constant 
entertainment for most of the time over the remainder of the trip, with fierce 
squalls bringing strong winds and heavy rain, followed by dead calms. We lost 
count of the times that we put some sails up, went like the clappers, then 
pulled them all down again and put the engine on when the wind died and the 
rolling waves made the sails slap lifelessly. The squalls could be seen coming 
in the day as a dark cloud with a shadow of rain under it.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>6th 
December</b><br>
 Merryn&#146;s birthday, and some good weather and fair wind 
for the day, which was a relief for everyone. Merryn had lots of home-made 
presents, and Jay spent a large part of the day cooking various things 
including chocolate brownies and a big curry with the last of the slightly 
shrivelled fresh veg on board.<br>
<br>
There was of course plenty of booze 
involved, with beers during morning present opening, champagne with lunch, and 
cocktails in the afternoon followed by lots more beer.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>7th 
December</b><br>
 Less than 200 miles to go, and finally a wonderful sail all 
afternoon, part of the first 24 hour period of continuous sailing yet. The 
miles seem finally to be clocking down rapidly as we near our target. Since we 
hadn&#146;t changed our boat time three hours forward yet to Caribbean time, 
the evenings had slowly opened out so that we were now able to eat evening meal 
outside, and there was even enough time for some evening guitar playing before 
dark.<br>
<br>
Just around dark we turned down for our final run downwind to 
Antigua.<br>
<b>8th December</b><br>
 The last night was unfortunately one 
where there was not a lot of sleep &#150; a downwind run is always a little 
rolley, but it felt like we were almost thrown out of our bunks for most of the 
night, but he sight of land increasing in size on the horizon helped to raise 
spirits. We approached land around 9am, and skirted round the island&#133;.<br>

<br>&#133;and a couple of hours later were anchored in English Harbour, in a 
beautiful anchorage with a lovely beach and clean water to swim in. 2050 miles 
done in 18 days &#150; a long way on a small boat in a big ocean, and everyone 
glad to be back on dry land again!<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Antigua is certainly a 
beautifully green island, mostly due to the large amount of rain that they have 
had this year. We stayed at anchor off Galleon beach, near English Harbour, for 
over a week, enjoying a relaxing time and wandering about the island. English 
Harbour has some lovely old buildings built in Nelson's era and is home to lots 
of boats, some of which are quite impressive.<br>
<br>
We had the good luck to 
meet a friend from home, Nico, who is out here working on a huge super yacht 
'Rebecca' (130ft long!) - the boat is a luxury floating hotel with all the 
comforts of home.<br>
<br>
Sadly we said goodbye to first Cesar, who was 
rushing home to be with his family for Christmas, and then Bernardo, who was 
continuing his travels down through Brazil. We had to have a few drinks with 
them first of course to see them on their way; we were very lucky to have found 
such a good pair of crew that we enjoyed having on board.<br>
<br>
The local 
tradition is to go to Shirley Heights, which overlooks where we were anchored, 
on Sunday night to see the steel band, watch the sunset over Monserrat and 
enjoy the barbeque.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately on the way down the path in the dark 
Jo managed to crack her wrist, which put her arm in plaster for 6 weeks and 
obviously made swimming difficult.<br>
 The relaxed time snorkelling off the 
boat in the anchorage and enjoying the local hospitality unfortunately had to 
come to and end since we needed to get the leaks fixed and to re-paint the 
bottom of the boat, so we went off to Jolly Harbour, a few hour's sail around 
the coast, to come out of the water to get the boat in good condition for the 
remainder of the trip.<br>
<br>
After looking at the seams between the planks, 
some of which were fairly poor and had caused our leaks, we decided that all 
the seams needed caulking and filling, and Mr Cochrane and his crew (Mannie, 
Llewellyn and Winston) were roped in to do the work for us since there were 
only 7 days to Christmas and it would have probably taken us months on our own!
<br><br>
Mr Cochraine urged me to point out that they did a good, fast and high 
quality job, are available for work on wooden boats anywhere in the world and 
that his phone number is 4628011 for anyone with a wooden boat visiting 
Antigua, and were certainly glad of their help to get us fixed up and back in 
the water.<br>
 Having spent the first night on the boat we were all attacked 
visciously by mosquitos which made a miserable time intolerable, so we got 
ourselves an apartment and stayed there at night during the work, which was a 
lovely break. There is usually some breeze and less mosquitos when anchored off 
the land, but temperature and mosquitos increase hugely when up on the land, 
plus the fridge and heads don't work and there is sanding dust everywhere, all 
making for an unpleasant time!<br>
While the work was done on the bottom of the 
boat, the topsides were sanded and repainted. Life was made 100% easier by 
having the use of a car to get all the bits and pieces that we need, that was 
lent to us by Barbara, it also helped with taking various friends and family to 
and from the airport.<br>
<br>
&#133; and the last of the treenails left over 
from Bristol where we could not get at them were drilled out and replaced.<br>

<br>After the newly caulked seams were filled with epoxy&#133;<br>
<br>
then 
came the job of painting the hull with bitchumen and antifouling, which is 
always a nice job breathing in lots of paint fumes under the boat, but a very 
necessary task to stop tropical worms eating the wood away. We were extremely 
relieved to have the boat back in the water late morning on Christmas Eve, and 
despite a small leak that initially caused concern but later stopped as the 
wood moistened and swelled, there were no other problems and we ran back round 
to galleon beach for Christmas, with Lista looking good in a new coat of paint.
<br><br>
Christmas day is a slightly different affair in the Carribean, the 
standard cold weather and roast turkey exchanged for a lovely warm and sunny 
day, an outside party in the dockyard with a live reggae band and a barbeque 
for dinner, all washed down by copious amounts of champagne provided mostly by 
Si and Debs at 11am.<br>
<br>
Then it was back to the boat for a succession of 
nice eats and of course lots more booze as the party faded towards twilight.<br>
 After several days of recovery and general running about Guy returned to spend 
a week with us on the 28th, bringing Phil with him at the same time. We had 
also managed to pick up Zoe in the meantime; having completed her time on the 
boat she had helped deliver across the Atlantic she needed somewhere to sleep 
whilst looking for another boating job.<br>
<br>
To show Guy, Phil and Zoe at 
least one day of sailing we went off around the west side of the island to 
Green Island, where we stayed for a few days enjoying the beautiful 
surroundings, snorkelling and scuba diving on the various reefs, although for 
some reason Guy was blamed for the cloudy and rainy weather which seems to 
follow him around the earth. On our return on New Year's Eve it was time to say 
goodbye to Jay for six weeks and it was off again to Nelson's dockyard for the 
New Year's Eve festivities which included a small fireworks display and some 
more music. Unfortunately some people took the festivities too far, the list of 
thoroughly wetted casualties for the night was three mobile phones, one digital 
camera and one bed, incidentally the first of two swampy visits that week. 
Anyhow after some recovery and little activity on the 1st Jan, 2005, the 2nd 
Jan heralded Maurice's second visit to the boat, and a fleeting visit by Merlin 
and Ann, who happened to be on holiday on Antigua. The evening involved another 
Shirley Heights visit, this time with no injuries on the way back down, and the 
next morning we were off again for a sail to Hawksbill Bay of the east side of 
the island, and stayed the night in a bay banked by mangroves and beaches.<br>

<br>Another surprise visit the next day was to see the Daws, long standing 
family friends, since they had come to Antigua for Alex to get married. We 
managed to gatecrash the ceremony itself a few days later and had a thoroughly 
good time.<br>
<br>
Having said a fond goodbye to all on Antigua, and seen Guy 
off back to England, we left towards St Lucia on 8th Jan, held up slightly by 
the recurrance of an issue at the top of the mast, which we had to have 
re-welded and strengthened.<br>
<br>
Crew was now down to five - Noel and Jo, 
Rob and Merryn and Maurice on board, and we made good progress down to St Lucia 
in three days in order to meet our next set of friends due to arrive on the 
11th.<br>
 After waving goodbye to Si and Phil in Antigua we headed out of 
English Harbour towards Guadeloupe, making good progress under just staysail 
and main, which we soon reefed as the wind increased and then reefed again at 
lunchtime. A happy event for Jo was the removal of her plaster cast after six 
weeks, with Noel playing doctor using a hacksaw blade.<br>
<br>
We arrived in 
Deshais, Guadeloupe before 4pm, anchoring off the beach and venturing into town 
to find a good feed in a French restaurant, finding it strange to be back using 
Euros and speaking French.<br>
<br>
The next morning it was another early start 
headed onwards to Dominica, starting off with all the sails up whilst behind 
the wind shadow of the island, but getting going well between the islands, 
managing a consistent 7-8 knots and up to 8.4 knots at one point, although we 
all got thoroughly wet in heavy showers.<br>
<br>
 We arrived in Castaways Bay, 
Dominica at around 5pm and stayed aboard that night, since we planned to get up 
early the next day - and we watched a spectacular sunset from the boat.<br>
<br>
As we headed off for Martinique the next morning under full sail, we had an 
escort of small dolphins for a while, and again the wind picked up as we got 
out from behind the island, sending us along at 6-7 knots until after lunch, 
when we went behind Martinique and had light variable winds again. We motored 
into Fort de France, which is in a huge bay, and anchored close to the old fort.
<br><br>
A thoroughly unsuccessful evening ensued, first being boarded by 
customs for an hour, which involved form filling and lots of poking around the 
boat, then having finally got ashore after a heavy shower, we wandered the 
streets for about an hour looking for a nice place to have a drink, but somehow 
we were unable to find anything apart from a run down and dirty bar full of 
strange old people. Having endured a quick beer, we finally found somewhere 
slightly better, but we certainly missed the main night life area ! Back on 
board for a late dinner, then up early again the next morning for the final run 
down to St Lucia, where we arrived between the Pitons by lunchtime.<br>
<br>

After delivering Maurice safely to Mary in her hotel at the Pitons, off we went 
to pick up our next guests - Ben, Jason and Lucy from the airport and that 
evening enjoyed a fabulous meal at the Jalousie Hilton hotel near to where we 
were moored.<br>
<br>
After some time spent relaxing on the boat and 
snorkelling in the beautifully clear water in the deep natural harbour, we went 
to Soufriere for the night and then on to Rodney Bay, where after anchoring in 
the usual way we headed ashore, only to be pulled out of the bar a little while 
later since the boat had dragged the anchor in the gusty wind and had actually 
hit another boat! Luckily all was well in the end and damage was very slight to 
all parties, nothing that a bottle of rum and many apologies couldn't mend.<br>

<br>After a somewhat sheepish exit from Rodney Bay we stopped in again at the 
Pitons to say goodbye to Maurice and Mary, and were headed off again towards St 
Vincent when about 15 minutes into the journey, there was a POP! and the engine 
room was suddenly full of smoke! After some frantic running about a burst 
exhaust box was diagnosed, caused by a cooling failure melting the box. We 
limped back into Soufriere with the boat billowing exhaust fumes, and spent the 
next day removing the offending exhaust, which unfortunately involved removing 
the gearbox first. A day spent running about trying to get it fixed eventually 
culminated in getting someone to make up a new one in fiberglass, which 
wouldn't melt in the event of another cooling failure, but would take 2 days to 
make, followed by another day refitting it - meanwhile we enjoyed the quality 
snorkelling off the reef right next to the boat, and made friends with the 
local sea ranger Norbert, who demonstrated how to drink two thirds of a bottle 
of vodka in an hour and still make sense.<br>
<br>
Our extended stay in St 
Lucia also allowed us to go for a walk to see the waterfalls take the dingy on 
a trip to a local deserted beach and take a local boat ride close in to the 
coast to see all the local villages, and enjoy several good sunsets from the 
deck.<br>
<br>
Having only a few days left with Ben, Jason and Lucy and having 
been unable to do much sailing due to our mechanical problems, we set off to do 
a three day round trip to Bequia, Mustique and St Vincent, returning to St 
Lucia in time to catch their flights. We went out in Bequia, where Lista Light 
had spent some 15 years with a previous owner, and ended up in a local bar 
where the lady kept complaining that she wanted to go home every time that we 
bought another round of drinks. There was plenty of pool playing with a few 
locals, one of whom claimed to have been one of the pirates in 'Pirates of the 
Carribean', since the film was shot in Bequia and St Vincent. We were also very 
pleasantly surprised to see a boat very similar to Lista Light, and when we 
went to speak to them the Norweigan boat builder on board said that his cutter 
was built in pretty much exactly the same place in Norway, a few years later.
<br><br>
Assisted by a good strong breeze, which turned into a downpour, we 
made Mustique just before dark.<br>
<br>
Mustique, home of the rich and famous, 
was certainly different from the other islands with its manicured lawns and 
facilities, but would not be completely seen without a quick visit to Basil's 
Bar in the evening.<br>
<br>
Beating into the sea on the way back to St 
Vincent, Ben was ecstatic to finally catch a fish, which rapidly became two in 
the space of ten minutes.<br>
<br>
We decided to have a 'Carribean evening' 
that night since it was Jason's last night when we reached Cumberland Bay, St 
Vincent. After finally managing to get rid of the locals selling grapefruits, 
coconuts and necklaces who couldn&#146;t wait for us to get anchored first and 
got completely in the way in their various craft, we tucked into the Pina 
Coladas. We had agreed to visit both of the small bars on the beach front, but 
we were disappointed to discover that they were all shut and everyone had gone 
home when we ventured out at 9pm, but luckily we had vast supplies of alchohol 
on board.<br>
<br>
Jason was slightly worse for wear as we beat back into the 
wind and sea the next morning, spending his last day mostly asleep below until 
we waved him off at the airport in the evening, having anchored for the night 
off Vieux Fort, St Lucia, close to the airport. We spent the next day and night 
at Laborie, the next bay down, which had a few reefs in and which required a 
look out for shallow water as we crept in.<br>
<br>
Noel was slightly put out 
by a policeman who told us we couldn't scuba dive without a local guide just as 
Noel, Jo and Rob had got fully kitted up and were just getting into the water 
off the beach, but after relaxing on the beach for a while we ordered food at 
the small beachside hotel for the evening and returned to the boat. Some pretty 
poor and generally unsucessful attempts at surfing the break on a reef near the 
boat were made by Ben and Rob before we headed ashore for supper, only to be 
told that the maid that we had ordered from had forgotten that the kitchen was 
closed that evening; we made amends by finding a local bar and having beer for 
dinner.<br>
 Back up to Vieux Fort the next morning so that we could drop Ben 
and Lucy at the airport, but not before an excellent lobster dinner - five 
lobster for &pound;8 bought from a local fisherman who came alongside in his 
boat.<br>
<br>
And then there were four again, and we left the next day and 
sailed back to Bequia, passing St Vincent again.<br>
<br>
We relaxed in Bequia 
for a few days, filled up with water and did some laundry, and walked to the 
other side of the island to a village called Spring.<br>
<br>
Next stop was 
Cariacou to meet Noel and Jo's new boat, since their time on Lista Light had 
come to an end. Due to a bad knot tying incident, the Grenada courtesy flag had 
come lose, so Merryn was forced to go up the mast for the first time to remedy 
the situation.<br>
<br>
After meeting Noel and Jo's new boat and making various 
arrangements for meeting up at the end of February, we headed back up the 
islands, first stopping at Union Island,<br>
<br>
then Canouan Island a short 
distance away, where we went for a lovely walk only to find that the entire 
other end of the island had been developed into a huge hotel complex and golf 
course, a bit disappointing since there was a lovely church on the top of the 
hill which we were no longer allowed to see unless we bought an 'all inclusive 
day pass'!<br>
<br>
After a quiet night, it was back of to Bequia again on the 
first February so that Jo could do a five day dive course. Whilst there Rob and 
Noel concentrated on some mainenance tasks and we saw another lovely boat, this 
time the english cutter 'Marguerite'<br>
<br>
The 'Prince William' also came 
into Bequia, and discharged a huge amount of teenagers all over the place.<br>

<br>Leaving Bequia again we headed back to St Lucia in time for the next family 
visit, picking up Art and Becky as hitchhikers for the journey and having a 
good sail with all the sails, including topsail, up and pulling us along at a 
steady 7 knots. We arrived back in Soufriere on the evening of the 6th, which 
happened to be Bob Marley's birthday, a good excuse for everyone to listen to 
even more Bob Marley, sung by an extremely loud open air band.<br>
<br>
We then 
carried on to Rodney Bay the next day to finally pick up the water pump repair 
kit for the generator, which had been out of action for almost a month. Rob set 
to work mending it straight away, and started on an insulated box to enclose 
the noisy engine in. We said goodbye to Art and Becky and after a troublesome 
time scuba diving trying to find our stern anchor which had snapped off the 
rope holding it and was lost in 6m of murky water, we went back to the now very 
familiar Soufriere. Noel and Jo set about finding themselves somewhere to stay 
in the town until they flew out to meet their new boat, and Merryn and Rob 
busied themselves tidying up the boat a little in preparation for the arrival 
of Jenny and Jules (Rob's mum and sister) and Jay.<br>
<br>
Staying at 
Soufriere few days with our new crew, we went and did the tourist thing and 
walked around the Botanical gardens, and saw the volcano and it's sulphur 
springs.<br>
<br>
Then it was off to Marigot Bay, and Jenny and Jules had a 
chance to steer the boat, although we had no wind at all!<br>
<br>
We spent a 
relaxing afternoon swimming and going to the local shop for some more food and 
beer, and Jenny was persuaded by the local palm weaver (who called himself 
'Special Effects') to buy a sun hat.<br>
<br>
A short trip down from Marigot 
the next day to pick up a mooring between The Pitons, and due to a good breeze 
the next day, we went out for a quick sail into the bay, to finally show Jenny 
and Jules what sailing was really like !<br>
<br>
The next event was Maurice 
and Mary getting married St Lucia style at the hotel there, a very relaxed and 
enjoyable event.<br>
<br>
The last day of Jenny and Jule's visit flew by, and 
before we knew it they were back to the snow in England. Merryn and Rob had 
been having kiteboarding lessons, and Rob finshed his off and managed to stand 
up on the board for at least 2 seconds.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile Craig and Katarina 
had come aboard as passengers for our third trip to Bequia, from where we plan 
to carry on down to Grenada and the ABC islands, and Panama by the end of March.
<br><br>
Not for the first time we were leaving St Lucia, but this time was the 
last; we headed off from a very roley anchorage between The Pitons with 
Katarina wondering whether she was going to feel unwell or not. We had a lovely 
sail down the windward side of St Vincent and in to Admiralty Bay for a few 
sundowners, after spending an hour hoping from unsuitable mooring to unsuitable 
mooring until the man who was offering them to us got so angry he put us on the 
biggest mooring in the bay, suitable for supertankers!<br>
<br>
The following 
morning was Katarinas Birthday so after opening a few cards and pressies we got 
ready to head over to Petit Nevis for the day. In the meantime Stuart, a friend 
that Jay had met on her first visit to the Caribbean in 1989 popped over, his 
initial couple of years away had turned into 16! Much of his time had been 
spent in the Pacific and New Zealand so he gave us lot of tips for places we 
couldn&#146;t miss. We climbed the hill behind the boat for a bit of exercise, 
which gave us a lovely view of the boat below.<br>
<br>
We found the anchorage 
all to ourselves that evening, and cooked home made burgers and marinated 
chicken on the barbeque.<br>
<br>
The next afternoon it was back to Bequia to 
drop Craig and Katarina off for their plane back home the next morning, having 
the good luck to see Endeavor, a beautiful 'J' class boat, zoom past us and 
anchor in Bequia.<br>
<br>
 The next day it was off again, this time for 
Tyrrell Bay, Carriacou after a short customs stop at Union Island on the way. 
Just before we entered the bay, we caught our first Barracuda which made a 
lovely meal that evening, and was enough for fishcakes for lunch the day after 
too!<br>
<br>
In Carriacou we met up again with Nick, whose boat had been 
caught in the hurricane at Grenada and badly damaged, who told us about a local 
boat launching happening the next day, which shouldn't be missed. After several 
hours and a lot of shouting, the boat was finally in the water.<br>
<br>
After 
the rest of the day relaxing, we headed down to Grenada, again a good sail with 
Endeavor steaming past us (Si, we knew you'd like another picture!)<br>
<br>
As 
we sailed down the side of Grenada, we found it strange that lots of houses had 
blue roofs, but as we got closer and used our tiny brains we realised that they 
were all blue tarpaulins and that many of the roofs were missing. We anchored 
in St George, the main port, and had a stroll around the town; most of the 
essential amenities were restored, but there was still a huge backlog of 
repairs to be done, and there were people rebuilding all over the place. 
Unfortunately the camera battery was flat so there are no pictures of the 
roofless churches, etc, but we did manage to get it working long enough to take 
a shot of the lovely colurs in the water in Grand Anse bay.<br>
<br>
After a 
couple of days relaxing and finding boat parts in Prickly Bay, just around the 
bottom of Grenada, we headed for the islands off the coast of Venezuela, with 
Merryn worrying after hearing stories about pirates and armed robbers attacking 
boats along the Venezuelan and Columbian coast. We sailed overnight, arriving 
in Los Testigos at midday, and were very pleasantly surprised to find a 
friendly and chatty young man where we reported in to immigration, rather than 
the usual aloof and rude Caribbean official. Los Testigos (which means The 
Witnesses) is a group of five or six islands with about 150 inhabitants who 
fish for a living, and keep themselves to themselves - a pleasant surprise was 
the lack of people hassling us for money or anything else while we were there!
<br> We went across the channel from where we checked in to stay the first 
night, and anchored off the beach behind a small island and reef which 
protected us from the swell.<br>
<br>
After a relaxing day snorkeling and 
climbing the sand dunes up the coast, we headed round to another small bay, 
where there were quite a few other boats, most of whom were French. There was a 
small spit of sand separating the windward side of the island from the leeward 
side, with waves breaking over it, which made for a strange beach, with waves 
coming at you from both sides!<br>
<br>
The sailors in the anchorage had 
befriended a local old fisherman who lives at the side of beach, and they used 
a lean-to at the side of his shack as a kind of social area in the evening, the 
arrangement being that in return, the old guy got a good helping of booze 
brought along by everyone! After chatting for a while, it turned out that the 
fisherman was off spear fishing the next day on his boat, and had invited 
everyone along, which was good fun, a few people getting lucky and catching a 
lobster or two.<br>
 We did another overnight sail with Merryn still panicking 
about pirates, and we arrived at Isla Blanquilla, a small island 90 miles west 
of Los Testigos which is only 60 ft high at its highest point, and has a few 
small settlements.<br>
<br>
Before we left again the next afternoon, we took a 
short dingy trip to Americano Bay, named after the American who built a house 
there, which is now ruined. The lovely small bay with beautifully coloured 
water and white sand was made even more interesting by a natural arch near the 
entrance.<br>
<br>
Keeping on moving towards our appointment with a few more 
crew in Bonaire on the 15th March, we left after lunch headed 120 miles west to 
Los Roques. The situation was made fairly desperate by the fact that we had run 
out of beer, white wine, tobacco and coffee, and there was reputed to be two 
supermarkets in the Los Roques! We motor-sailed overnight with jib and staysail 
poled out, since there was not enough wind to keep the mainsail filled as we 
rolled about in the waves, headed directly downwind.<br>
<br>
In the morning 
the wind was a bit stronger, so we had a better sail with the mainsail up, and 
arrived at the Los Roques islands about midday. There is a narrow southern 
entrance between a reef and the land, then a ten-mile sail up alongside a reef, 
with beautiful iridescent turquoise, green and blue coloured water, which made 
it fairly easy to see where the water was deep, although a watch from higher up 
made it obvious where we needed to steer. Unfortunately the photos don't really 
do the colours justice.<br>
<br>
After anchoring off Le Grand Roc, the main 
island in the group, we went ashore for some shopping, managing to get some 
beer and a few other items, although the shops were fairly small. The island is 
basically a Venezuelan holiday resort, with most of the buildings smart holiday 
homes, and lots of restaurants and bars. The whole town had an almost twee 
look, since it was so nicely maintained, with brightly coloured buildings and 
sandy streets.<br>
 Pelicans were everywhere on and around the water, and were 
considered a pest by the local fisherman!<br>
<br>
After a welcome night's 
sleep at anchor rather than on the go, we had a morning stroll up the hill to 
the old lighthouse, before it got too hot. There were fabulous views all around 
of the outlying islands and reefs, which the camera again didn&#146;t do 
justice to.<br>
<br>
We carried on ten miles west to a beautiful small island 
and reef where we stayed the night, and next morning before we left an old 
fisherman came up to us in his boat with his tame heron sitting on the side. He 
asked if we wanted any fish, and knowing that we had no Bolivar to pay him with 
didn't stop him throwing 3 fish on board. We ended up giving him with a roll of 
insulation tape, which he was extremely pleased with, and we enjoyed the fish 
fried for supper that night!<br>
<br>
The next stop, a leisurely half day's 
sail, was to Las Aves (which means the birds) , which are two deserted islands 
and reefs, but this time with covered by mangrove trees inhabited by thousands 
of sea birds. We spent the evening in complete desertion, except for the 
raucous sound of hundreds of birds roosting in the trees.<br>
<br>
The next hop 
was a long one so we were up at first light, surprised that the birds hadn't 
woken us up already. After following our course threading back out between the 
reefs in the half-light, we went past the second Las Aves island and headed for 
Bonaire, the next island along. Bonaire is part of the Dutch Antillies, which 
are owned by the Dutch, so we were officially leaving Venezuela.<br>
 We 
arrived in good time that afternoon, picking up a mooring just in front of 
Karel's bar along the main front of Kralendijk, which is the capital of 
Bonaire. Bonaire is very cautious of reef destruction and so keen on it's 
thriving diving tourist industry that anchoring is not allowed anywhere around 
the island ! We anchored next to a bright yellow aussie boat called Neliandrah 
('butterfly' in aboriginal - that&#146;s for Maurice) who we had a lot of fun 
and many drinks with, rarely has Jay been known to down so many rum and cokes!!
<br><br>
A few days of the usual running about trying to find bits for the 
boat, and getting down to the outstanding jobs followed, with Jay getting 
completely covered in paint again and repainting vast areas of the inside of 
the boat.<br>
We had noticed for a while that the end of one of the planks in 
the side of the boat had started to spring out, and had not got round to 
refixing it, the result being that it had slowly got worse. We decided that it 
was finally time to tackle it and tied up alongside a dock in a nearby marina 
for the day, where Rob was able to drill a few holes and attach some threaded 
bar to wind the end of the plank back in (sorry no photos of this exciting 
repair). We also took the chance to change the engine oil, fill the tanks up 
with water and went back to our mooring that evening near the bar (which we had 
got fairly tired with since it played extremely loud music until 3am several 
evenings a week). Right in the middle of all the mending, with half the 
interior of the boat also in piles from the painting, Mike (the first new crew 
member we had found through crewing websites on the internet) turned up - we 
wouldn't have blamed him for turning round and running off straight away after 
one look at the mess but he stayed, and pitched in with the boat maintenance 
over the next few days.<br>
 We had heard about some very cheap, small and 
plastic twin tub washing machines available in Bonaire, and we ended up buying 
one and getting it back to the boat in a hired jeep. No more hunting for a 
launderette!! Merryn got to work straight away at the backlog and spent most of 
the day testing the new machine out, which is light enough to carry up onto 
deck to do washing, and small enough to stow away in the engine room when not 
in use, and hopefully won't rust into a pile within months!<br>
<br>
We made 
full use of the jeep and used it to go provisioning at a warehouse cash and 
carry, and then went for a three hour drive around the island, sometimes 
finding our way along dirt roads and getting generally lost seeing some 
beautiful bays with light blue water. We did see a couple of flamingoes, but 
didn&#146;t go right down to the south where the salt lagoons are and there are 
flocks of them.<br>
<br>
We waited just one more day for Stuart to turn up (our 
second new crew member, a Kiwi, who we had met in Grenada and had followed us 
to Bonaire on another boat) and then spent another day getting everything back 
in its proper place and organised, and did a final trip to the supermarket for 
fresh produce, then set off for Curacao on the morning of 19th March with a 
fresh 15-20 knots breeze, putting all the sails up to show Mike and Stuart the 
ropes, and practicing reefing the main amongst other things.<br>
<br>
 We had a 
great sail all the way across, making 6-7 knots and with the current helping 
too. We arrived outside Willemstad, the capital of Curacao at about 4pm, then 
realised that Rob hadn't been paying attention to where we were supposed to be 
going and no-one had checked - we were supposed to be going to Spanish Water, a 
lagoon we had sailed past an hour ago! We turned around and beat back into the 
wind and sea with the engine on full blast, and managed to find our way up the 
narrow channel into the lagoon and drop the anchor just before dark.<br>
<br>

After a quick shower at the local marina the next morning (made slightly more 
difficult since the door was locked and we all had to climb over it), we set 
off for our passage to Panama, some 760 miles (about 6-7 days). The forecast 
was for Easterly wind, 20-25 knots (force 5-6) which is pretty much perfect 
strong breeze to get 35 tons of Lista Light ploughing through the water. We 
made near to 150 miles in each 24-hour period for the first three days, which 
much be close to a record for consistency over a long period of time! The waves 
were big, but since we were going in the same direction as them, we were fine, 
although Merryn managed to get drenched by a particularly huge wave breaking 
over the stern whilst she was steering.<br>
<br>
During the night of the third 
day, the wind increased until we had only the main up with all three reefs in, 
and we were still going a consistent 6.5 - 7 knots, and up to 12 knots surfing 
down waves as they broke behind us. Reefing the main, always a struggle even 
with five or six people across the Atlantic, was made much easier (and a two 
man job) by reefing tackle that Rob had rigged up before leaving Grenada, since 
there had been only three on board.<br>
<br>
All good things come to an end, 
and throughout the fourth day the wind and sea dropped steadily and we shook 
the reefs out and put up more sails but to no avail - by the evening, there was 
no wind and the engine was back on, which is how it stayed for the next few 
days until we reached the Sanblas Islands, off the East coast of Panama. During 
the voyage, we had decided to stop in at the islands, which are reported to be 
unmissable, even though we had concerns about the time it would take to make 
the Panama canal arrangements - some rumours suggested a two-week wait.<br>
 
The Sanblas are an archipelago of several hundred small islands and reefs 
stretching along the Panama coast, inhabited by the Kuna people, who are the 
second shortest race on earth - even Merryn towered over some of the ladies!<br>
<br>We were instantly surrounded by Kuna in their dugout canoes, trying to sell 
us their 'molas' which are detailed appliqu&eacute;d cloth made up of many 
layers of different material.<br>
<br>
Jay couldn't resist herself and bought 
half their stock, and we finally got rid of them all and had a chance to relax 
a couple of hours, and have a well earned swim after five days at sea. After 
lunch we popped over to see customs and immigration on a nearby main island, 
where the small runway is (we managed to anchor in the flight path first time, 
and got shouted at to move.)<br>
 As we hadn't really been keeping track of 
dates, we were dubious about the overtime payments they asked for, making it a 
total of $150 for a three month cruising permit (the smallest available) and 
immigration, until we finally realised that it was Easter Friday. It was also 
Rob's birthday, so we went for a meal at a hotel on a nearby island, and drunk 
far too much rum late into the morning.<br>
<br>
After a very slow start the 
next morning, we headed off for another island called Gunboat island, and 
stayed there for the night, and did lots of snorkeling on the reef and we saw 
our first big rays. There were a couple of other boats there from Austria, who 
invited us to a barbeque over a large fire on the shore that evening.<br>
<br>

Our fifth stop was back to the East to Hollandaise Cays, which was highly 
recommended by people we had met - there was a boat whose owners had found the 
place so lovely that they had stayed there for five years! The entry to the 
sheltered lagoon (called the Swimming Pool because the water was such a pale 
blue) involved weaving in and out of several reefs, so a careful look-out was 
required to get in.<br>
<br>
After several unsuccessful attempts at spear 
fishing that afternoon, even getting the scuba gear on for a higher chance of 
success, we returned empty handed, but still had an excellent crab and crayfish 
dinner that we had bought earlier from local fisherman.<br>
 Leaving the next 
morning as the sun rose over the island for the last part of the trip to 
Panama, we were cautious with the engine since we had run very low on diesel, 
and tried to make the best of the light wind coming from ahead of us.<br>
<br>

As the day wore on, the wind increased and even though we were close hauled, we 
were managing 5-6 knots by the afternoon, with a full set of sails up which is 
probably another record, since Lista Light's windward performance is not 
usually much to write home about.<br>
<br>
We were still sailing nicely to 
windward when we arrived at our overnight stop in Punta Playa Chichita, a small 
village along the coast of Panama. We had a gap in our paper charts of the 
area, and so the journey along the Panama coast had been done using electronic 
charts from Rob's laptop, which had proved invaluable, and a good trial of the 
backup technology.<br>
<br>
Up early the next morning, we continued to Panama 
with a fair wind all the way, and we started to see more and more large boat 
traffic leaving and approaching the canal as the afternoon wore on.<br>
<br>
We 
entered the harbour area about 4pm and were anchored outside the Panama Canal 
Yacht Club, just off Colon, by 5pm. Having heard so many different reports of 
the waiting time, we got straight down to the paperwork the next morning, 
enlisting the help of one of the taxi drivers to do immigration, Panama visas 
for the entire crew and going to see the Panama Canal admeasurement office, 
which is the first step in the procedure - to get someone to come out and 
measure the boat, which decides how much you have to pay.<br>
We rushed about 
getting the bowsprit in before the admeasurer arrived the next day, since 
without the bowsprit we are very nearly 50 foot, which puts us in the cheaper 
category (600US instead of 850US). It all went successfully and we were 
measured at 49 foot something, which was very kind of the measurer! Having gone 
through that, we had to pay the money into the bank and phone for our transit 
date that evening - which turned out to be the 21st April, almost three weeks 
away, which was a little disappointing.<br>
 In the meantime we had met up with 
Noel and Jo, who had arrived before us on their boat, and they told us that 
dates were being moved forward all the time, so we were hopeful of actually 
getting through much sooner, probably at least 1 week earlier.<br>
 Meanwhile a 
long time to wait - but luckily there is always something to be done on Lista 
Light; we also found a man selling cheap diesel (as long as you don't ask where 
it comes from) which we took a long time siphoning out of drums that he 
delivered to the deck, and generally getting the deck and ourselves covered in 
diesel. It was also time to get shopping, since most things are expensive on 
remote Pacific islands - we tried to shop for the next 3-6 months, and so ended 
up with a big pile of shopping to be slotted in all over the boat.<br>
<br>
So 
a waiting game until we get a better canal date, but we have a few tricks up 
our sleeve which might succeed, so we may get through very soon.<br>
There is a 
Panama Canal web cam, so when we know our transit date and rough time I'll send 
out an email.<br>
<br>
After much wheeling and dealing, which involved having 
the boat re-measured (with the bowsprit this time), taking us into the 65+ foot 
category, which meant that we had a free pilot and so got through much quicker, 
we finally had our transit date, the 7th April. We had spent 10 days in Colon, 
which lived up to its name of being as close to the arse end of anywhere we've 
been so far, with the guides recommending taking a taxi and not walking 
anywhere. Rob and Mike were lucky enough to drive through the middle of a riot 
whilst on their way to get some bread - there were burning tyres in the street, 
to the left a load of protesters, to the right lines of police with riot 
shields; the taxi driver simply swerved around people beeping his horn. The 
riots were due to the huge disproportion between wages - anyone that has 
anything to do with The Panama Canal or the government earns a fortune and 
everyone else sees very little of the $500 million annual profit from the canal 
(Panamax freighters can pay in excess of $100,000 each to cross the canal).<br>

 During the wait, to get a feel for what was needed when we went through the 
canal, Merryn and Rob went line handling on Endelig (the boat that Noel and Jo 
joined.)<br>
<br>
In the meantime we were joined again by Ian, and also by 
Robin (Jay's friend from Canada) who had come for the trip through the canal 
and down to the Galapagos Islands.<br>
At 4am on the morning of 7th April, 
after yet another sleepless mosquito-filled night, our pilot Milo came on board 
and we set off for the first lock of the canal in the darkness. We followed a 
huge ship into the lock and tied up behind it, suspended in the centre of the 
chamber by four long ropes to the walls above.<br>
<br>
The Gatun lock consists 
of three consecutive lock chambers which together lift boats 26 metres above 
sea level to the Gatun Lake. The water came in to the lock and lifted us up 
slowly, boiling around us and pushing us all over the place. The line handlers 
at each corner had to make sure that the ropes were tight as we rose up, as 
once a line becomes slack the boat can surge in that direction and risks 
hitting the wall. We were glad that we had recruited a big Aussie friend Roger 
who had to help Merryn on her corner!<br>
<br>
As the large ship in front of us 
moved between the chambers its propeller caused a lot of turbulence which made 
it very difficult to keep the boat moving in a straight line as we followed it. 
As a result of the turbulence our entry into the second chamber wasn't quite 
straight, and by the time the ropes were attached we had started to move 
rapidly to one side. Unfortunately it became apparent that one of the special 
ropes that we had hired was too short as the end of it vanished over the side 
of the boat, and some panic ensued, but luckily the pilot knew his stuff and 
helped Rob bring the boat back under control and we regained the line.<br>
<br>

Through the third lock and now at the level of Gatun lake, we motored 50Km 
across the lake which was very beautiful, although it was a steamy overcast 
day. The lake has crocodiles in it and noisy monkeys in the rainforest at the 
waters edge. There are lots of little islands and submerged villages in the 
lake which was flooded in order to create the canal.<br>
<br>
After following 
the passage through the lake we arrived at the Pedro Miguel lock which is the 
first lock taking boats back down towards the Pacific and into the Miraflores 
lake. On each side of the lock there are shiny locomotives which help pull the 
tankers through with big cables, and ensure that they don't hit the sides.<br>

<br>We arrived at the final Miraflores lock and were able to go through tied up 
next to a big Quicksilver surf tour boat and with some friends on a kiwi boat 
tied up outside us, which meant that we didn&#146;t have the hassle of line 
handling which was good.<br>
<br>
Despite our early arrival, Jules managed to 
catch us in the lock on the webcam. We are the middle boat of the three.<br>

<br>We finally made it through at 2pm which meant that we were on the web cam 
several hours earlier than expected, again it was a bit hairy leaving the final 
lock as when the salt water meets the fresh water the different densities cause 
a big current, we had to motor out at full speed to stop ourselves being pulled 
over to the side. Exactly at the time the lock gates opened there came a 
torrential downpour to welcome us into the Pacific - however we'd made it and 
celebrations ensued even though we were absolutely knackered!<br>
<br>
We then 
anchored for the night near Flamenco Island a few miles out of the canal and 
cleared out of customs that afternoon, ready for departure to the Las Perlas 
islands the next morning, and then on to the Galapagos Islands.<br>
<br>
The 
next morning we finally left Panama and carried on towards the Las Perlas 
islands, which are about 40 miles off the Panama coast. The weather was 
absolutely scorching, with not a breath of wind and a flat sea to motor over. 
As we overheated buckets of water were thrown here and there in an attempt to 
keep cool!<br>
We caught a Bonito, probably the largest fish by weight so far, 
and landing it was made much easier by the new gaff that Mike had made.<br>
<br>
Jay, Mike and Ian were playing with sextants during the later part of the 
afternoon when Mike complained that there was something wrong with his sextant, 
since the shape of the sun had gone strange - then we remembered that the canal 
pilot had told us that there was the extremely rare occasion of an 
annular-total eclipse occurring on the 8th. We watched as the black disc slowly 
spread over the sun and everything went dark - apparently Panama was the best 
place to see this, and luckily we were there.<br>
<br>
As the day got lighter 
again, we approached the anchorage in the Las Perlas islands and after some 
reef dodging (made more confusing with different charts telling us that 
different reefs and rocks were in different places) we anchored near 'Marie 
Tomasia', the boat that had been alongside us when we came out of the canal.<br>
 After a delicious barbie with the fat Bonito on it we had a few beers with our 
neighbours.<br>
 The next morning it was departure for Galapagos, but not 
before a walk ashore, where Robin did some quiet bird watching after he got rid 
of everyone else clambering about.<br>
<br>
The vegetation was a huge 
difference to the tropical coconut palms that we were used to - the trees on 
the island looked more like something that would be seen in a British autumn, 
although that could probably be blamed on the fact that the island was very 
rocky, and that water was scarce in the dry season.<br>
<br>
Then it was off to 
the Galapagos, 850 miles (approx 8-9 days depending on the wind), straight into 
a favourable but light breeze which allowed us to make 5 knots with just a 
small amount of engine help, with all sails up. The wildlife was extraordinary 
- the catalogue of sea animals seen for the day was: more than 15 turtles, 2 
sharks, 2 schools of dolphins, a huge manta ray about 8 foot square that we 
nearly hit, and 2 five foot swordfish jumping out of the water.<br>
<br>
As the 
day progressed the wind died to nothing and we baked in the sun again, but all 
at once at about 5pm the wind got up again nicely and we could turn the engine 
off and sail along well. Towards midnight we went around the point at the edge 
of Panama bay, and with the current making the sea lumpy around the point, the 
number of large ships about requiring dodging (we counted 8 at one point), and 
the wind dying slightly we had to take everything down again and we motored on 
through the night.<br>
 The next day (10th April) was more overcast and a 
welcome relief from the heat and sun (we were down to 32C from 34C), but the 
wind refused to do anything except blow gently from precisely ahead of us.<br>

<br>We continued motoring into the wind throughout the whole day on the 11th, 
and due to lack of inspiration on the sailing front there was much achieved. 
Rob fitted the new inverter that Ian had brought out from England, and Ian set 
to work carving a new lizard. Merryn and Rob both managed to fit a couple of 
exercises into the busy regime!<br>
<br>
Gradually the sea became more and more 
lumpy due to wind and current against us - this didn&#146;t fair too favourably 
with Jay or Robin's stomachs, and slowed us down considerably.<br>
<br>
12th 
April, and the wind slowly came round to port, and we managed to sail close 
hauled on a port tack with the job, staysail, main and mizzen up, but 
unfortunately the wind wasn't strong enough to turn the engine off, and down 
came the sails that evening when the wind came back round too far for us to use 
it. We kept expecting the current to change from being against us - the 
Equatorial counter current would at some point change into the Equatorial 
current that would help our progress, but it seemed to have disappeared! We 
were caught between a rock and a hard place, unable to use the wind to sail 
north since we wouldn't get out of the counter current, and unable to sail 
south since we couldn't sail close enough to the wind to make it worth it.<br>

The night of the 14th it got extremely cold, just to add to all the other 
oddities we thought that being 1degree from the equator it would be getting 
really hot. Our only conclusion, drawn from the fact that the water temperature 
dropped 4 degrees C, is that the favourable Humboldt current that travels north 
up the Peruvian coast bringing cold water from the southern ocean was bringing 
cold air with it. By the morning we were eating porridge as if we were 
experiencing an English winter!<br>
<br>
The only consolation was that the wind 
had finally moved enough after 3 days of motoring dead into the wind, and we 
were able to raise all the sails and make some progress close hauled, although 
the wind wasn't quite strong enough to turn the engine off. Robin was also 
finally feeling a lot better after 3 days of nil by mouth!<br>
<br>
A few days 
more of the same, but with the current against us finally slowly turning into a 
slight push from behind. Mike cooked a hearty British bangers, mash and beans 
meal which kept spirits up!<br>
<br>
As we neared the Galapagos we approached 
and crossed the equator, a had a glass or two of champagne to celebrate.<br>

<br>The next morning as dawn broke we had our first views of the Galapagos 
Islands as we approached from the North, and on the way in we circled Kicker 
Rock, a huge vertical-sided rock sticking out of the water.<br>
<br>
We dropped 
anchor in Wreck Bay, island of San Cristobal at about 11am and munched our way 
through a hearty fry-up before going ashore to have a look around. Seals were 
everywhere, laying on boats, rocks and just about anywhere they could have a 
good nap, and some were playing on the small slipway as we approached the town. 
We had heard many rumours about difficulties about cruising around and entering 
the Galapagos, since the Port Captains can be quite strict about permits and 
allowing sufficient time and freedom to see the islands. When we registered, 
the Port Captain in San Cristobal told us that we weren't allowed to visit any 
of the other islands and had to go straight to the Marquesas from there!<br>

<br>Despite our instructions, our route through the islands was as follows :<br>
<br>The next day, Rob and Mike got into the water and played with a couple of 
seals for a while around the boat. They were surprisingly tame and seemed to 
enjoy rolling around in the water with humans!<br>
<br>
Noel and Jo arrived not 
long after us, so a few beers were necessary after a slightly misleading meal 
in a local restaurant, which was nonetheless very good and cheap.<br>
<br>
It 
was time to explore and so Jay, Robin, Ian, Stu and Merryn took an all-day taxi 
and did the rounds over the island, whilst Mike and Rob did some admin in town. 
The explorers were pretty pleased with themselves, having managed to get a 
taxi-pickup to drive them to all of the places of interest at a quarter of the 
price of a 'tour' being touted by the local conman, whilst Rob wasn't pleased 
by the website which took pretty much all day to get to work after the Panama 
Canal update went a bit wrong.<br>
 The explorers took the taxi to a turtle 
sanctuary where the San Cristobal Giant Tortoise could be found, and then they 
walked a mile to the coast on a cinder track.<br>
<br>
After a quick dip in the 
breakers, it was picnic time, which the tiny Darwinian finches seemed to enjoy, 
then it was back to the taxi to get to El Junco, the main volcano on San 
Cristobal. The climb up it took less than an hour, and the cooling mist was 
quite a relief!<br>
<br>
Meanwhile various seals had taken up residency in the 
dingy, and they looked so sweet that we didn&#146;t have the heart to throw 
them out, except when we needed to use it. They didn&#146;t make that much 
mess, only a few hairs and the odd bit of mucus to clean up!<br>
<br>
For the 
next couple of days Robin, Jay and Ian went for a few more walks, we filled up 
with diesel and some water, Rob changed the engine oil and fuel filters and 
then went for a regrettable surf which unfortunately involved ending up being 
washed up forcibly on some rocks, and resulted in several days of limping. We 
did however see some marine iguanas, although we only caught a relatively small 
one on camera.<br>
<br>
Having said goodbye to Ian as he flew back home via 
Equador, we went off to another small island, Florentina, where the port 
captain there was pleased to see us, and was happy to let us stay several days. 
Stuart went off for a huge walk 8km inland to climb the biggest volcano in the 
morning, with the intention of meeting us when we arrived up there later on in 
a local truck to see the only island water source - unfortunately the truck had 
a burst tyre and was unable to take us up there, so Jay and Robin had to walk 
up to find him and bring him back down! Meanwhile Rob, Merryn and Mike walked 
around the edge of the island and found a small island separated from the 
mainland at high tide, where there were several seals playing in the surf, and 
some nicely breaking waves.<br>
<br>
The next morning we took a panga, a local 
fishing boat, and went off to see the sights of the island -<br>
<br>
First 
stop was Post Office Bay, where since 1792 people have left letters in a barrel 
for visitors to take back to their own countries and post for them. Lately, 
visiting yachts have carved small wooden plaques and left them there too, 
creating a bit of a random sign post effect - this is said to be the only 
acceptable graffiti in the islands.<br>
<br>
Further up the hill there is a 
lava tube, which is a hollow tube formed by the top solidifying over a lava 
flow, and then the lava flowing out into the sea. We climbed down into it and 
followed it down to sea level in the dark, until the beautifully cold water 
reached over our knees.<br>
<br>
Getting back into the panga, we headed off up 
to the top corner of the island, and walked up to a lagoon with flamingoes in 
it, then carried on to the other side and had a paddle in the water at the 
beach. Merryn was very impressed by the colourful crabs climbing the rocks on 
the shore.<br>
<br>
The final visit was to 'Devil's Crown', an old volcano cone 
in the sea, which had good snorkeling around the side and inside the cone.<br>

<br>After a quick lunch on board, we were off again in the back of a Landrover 
to see the pirate caves near the only water source on the island, where water 
drips out of a rock layer about 8km inland. There was also a tortoise pen, 
where we saw yet more big tortoises.<br>
<br>
The next day we weighed anchor 
early in the morning, headed off to Isabella, the largest island in the group. 
Unfortunately, there was no wind al all, so we motored the whole way in the 
strong sunshine, but we saw a few whales nearby and a school of dolphins.<br>

<br>We arrived in Porto Villamil, Isla Isabella, that afternoon and anchored 
near lots of other boats in a small lagoon.<br>
<br>
After exploring the town 
the next day, which had sandy streets and lots of nice houses on the outskirts, 
we went to a tortoise sanctuary where hundreds of tortoises, from tiny 
hatchlings to huge old ones a hundred years old, were kept.<br>
<br>
On the way 
back we couldn't resist a picture of a large marine iguana sunning itself on a 
wall near the beach.<br>
<br>
The next trip, starting early the next morning, 
was a ride in a pickup truck half way up the largest volcano, followed by a 
horse ride for an hour, then a walk down through the lava fields to the most 
recently erupted volcano. Jay, Mike and Stuart chose the horse option, whilst 
the rest of us walked a round trip of 12km each, but the cool breeze up the 
volcano made it less arduous.<br>
<br>
The horse ride took us up to and along 
the rim of the largest crater, the second biggest in the world, at six miles 
across - a wonderful view.<br>
<br>
After a rest and a quick lunch, came the 
walk through the lava to the site of the most recent eruption, which luckily 
was 25 years ago.<br>
<br>
The view over the numerous craters and back down to 
the sea was fantastic, and after another two hours of walking we were back down 
at the truck to take us home.<br>
<br>
The next morning Rob, Merryn and Robin 
took the boat across to Santa Cruz, the capital of the Galapagos. Robin was 
flying out back to Quito and then on to Canada; Rob and Merryn went to get the 
all important passport exit stamp, and to withdraw some money for everyone, 
since Isabella has no banks!<br>
 We plan to spend the next week filling to the 
brim with diesel and water, buying our last stock of fresh fruit and veg, and 
finding last minute essentials before our longest sea leg of the journey, the 
30 day sail to the Marquesas. There is little wind reported, although the trade 
winds and current should help us to a fair degree in our crossing. Hopefully, 
if we don't go mad during 30 continuous days at sea, we should arrive in Fatu 
Hiva sometime around the first week of June.<br>
<br>
We finally extracted 
ourselves and our fully laden boat from the Galapagos islands at 4pm, Monday 
2nd May and set off on our voyage to the Marquesas, with 2915 miles to go. We 
had spent the last few days fetching and carrying water and diesel in drums, 
sacks of vegetables, fresh produce and meat to the boat; all tanks were full to 
the brim and vegetables were stacked everywhere, including two entire banana 
stalks in the shower, which was the only place we could find to keep them 
safely!<br>
<br>
We headed out around the bottom of Isabella aided by a light 
breeze and jib, main and staysail up, until we were clear to set course 
directly for the Marquesas, just as the sun went down over the last land that 
we would see for a month.<br>
<br>
The sea was beautifully flat and despite the 
light wind, we managed to make 5 knots with a bit of help from the current, 
though by 10pm the mainsail was down due to too much flapping around and the 
engine was on. Just after 1am, with Merryn and Rob on watch, there was suddenly 
a great big thud and a clang, and something broke the surface of the water on 
the starboard side, off the stern. We never knew what we hit, despite looking 
for it with a light soon after, but whatever it was was reasonably solid and 
sounded like it had hit the propeller as well as the hull. We didn&#146;t 
spring any leaks and the prop didn&#146;t seem to make any more vibration than 
usual, so we presumed all was OK, though we will only be able to tell when we 
have a look underneath when we are at anchor.<br>
 3rd May<br>
The next scare 
the next morning during breakfast was when the engine suddenly started to peter 
out, but it was only Rob who had been equalizing the diesel between the two 
tanks and had managed to turn off the wrong stop tap, so there was no problem. 
Just after lunch we had our first whale visitor of the voyage, identified as a 
Short-finned Pilot Whale, who stayed with us only a few minutes before 
disappearing.<br>
<br>
 During the day the wind increased nicely and we ended 
up sailing well in the late morning through to just before midnight, when the 
wind died as it had the night before and it was back on with the engine went 
back on. By the next morning there was a chance to turn the engine off again as 
the wind picked up, and we tried the mizzen with poled staysail and jib, which 
gave us 4 knots, but felt a bit strange and made the boat roll around all over 
the place. By midday we had had enough of the experiment and we headed off 20 
degrees for a broad reach, with all sails up we managed 6&frac12; knots VMG 
which was much better and more comfortable. Continuing the after-lunch whale 
theme, the day's visitor was a huge 40 foot long Bryde's Whale who swam around 
and under us for about ten minutes.<br>
<br>
During the course of the day our 
speed steadily increased under the influence of the Equatorial counter current, 
which seemed to be helping us along at between 1&frac12; and 1&frac34; knots, 
until we were reaching a healthy consistent speed of over seven knots. There 
followed many days of fantastic sailing, clocking up 162 miles, 190 miles, 181 
miles, 170 miles in four consecutive 24-hour periods, breaking all records for 
Lista Light! The wind was consistent F4-5 which sent us along beautifully, 
although as the wind rose and fell we needed many adjustments and reefs in and 
out, smaller and bigger jibs up and down to keep going as fast as we dared 
without snapping the mast! The only downside to all this wind was pretty large 
waves after a few days, but we had enough speed to cut through them and enough 
pressure from the wind to stay heeled over a little and not roll about much, so 
it wasn't too uncomfortable.<br>
<br>
We soon realised that the bananas were 
ripening (most of them at the same time) so it was bananas for breakfast and 
snacks, banana milkshake in the afternoon, and fried banana for desert!<br>
<br>
We had a good run in the fishing department, clocking up 8 Dorado in four days, 
four of them within an hour! Most of our success was due to our new squid lure 
which we put out after finding lots of small squids washed up on the deck in 
the mornings (which made a change from flying fish); these are obviously the 
Dorado's favourite lunch.<br>
<br>
Despite steering the boat and the usual 
galley tasks, there is plenty of time to get lots of jobs done. Merryn was 
finally forced in front of the sewing machine and did some repairs to several 
pairs of tatty looking shorts, and Rob scarfed and lashed a crack in the 
whisker pole, and had a second go at mending a persistent leak in the floor of 
the dinghy, this time reading the patch kit instructions first.<br>
<br>
Day 
eight, and Stu cuts up the last of the fresh meat, so it's vegetarian menu from 
now on, except for some vacuum packed meats in the fridge, but we have sack 
loads of onions, potatoes and oranges, and lots of cabbage and marrows left, 
and of course whatever the sea provides.<br>
<br>
Even more bananas are ready, 
and starting to go black and smelly, and we realise that we may have 
over-stocked on them slightly. Merryn gets in the shower to harvest them all, 
and Jay makes more banana milkshake, some lovely banana bread, and slices up 
some banana to dry in the sun and make banana crisps.<br>
<br>
Mike caught our 
biggest Dorado yet, and made Cerviche with it - raw fish filleted and marinated 
in lemon/lime juice. Lovely! Unfortunately, this was the last fish we were to 
catch, sod's law of course since the meat had run out!<br>
<br>
By day 11 (12th 
May) we reached our halfway stage, with 1457 miles left to go. After the 
all-time record of 190 miles in a day on the second day when the wind and the 
current was strongest, we had been slowly decreasing our daily total towards 
150 miles, which is still remarkable for us, sailing along very well at 6-7 
knots most of the time. Unfortunately the favourable current had pretty much 
deserted us, with now sometimes &frac12; knot at best, which had also 
contributed to the reduction in our progress. At about 6am, Stuart suddenly had 
difficulty steering - one of the steering cables had snapped! We rushed to find 
the bit of scaffolding pole that we carry as an emergency tiller to stick 
through the top of the rudder, since we were under full sail and we could have 
ended up pointing in any direction. After it got light, Rob unearthed the 
backup cables that we had taken off in Seville, and fitted the replacement 
cable from the dingy, whilst we were hove to. As the wind abated slowly there 
were some periods during the previous day, during the lulls, when the sails 
slammed about as we rolled around until finally we tried turning and running 
downwind, with the engine helping to keep us going through the water. This was 
a chance for Mike to try out his spinnaker ideas using a huge heavy old sail we 
had, but unfortunately we didn't have much success since the wind wasn't strong 
enough to hold the heavy fabric filled, so we ended up running for several days 
under poled jib and poled staysail with the engine helping us along slowly, our 
usual set-up for very light following winds.<br>
<br>
The day's bad luck with 
equipment ended with the engine alternator not charging late that evening, 
though this was remedied by Rob taking it apart the next morning and releasing 
a stuck brush, and all worked OK. The next morning Rob was again working away 
in the engine room, this time changing the gearbox oil since it was well 
overdue for a change. As the wind grew slightly stronger, we were able to sail 
goose winged under main and poled staysail which gave us a slow rolling motion, 
which was almost relaxing!<br>
<br>
Towards nightfall, the wind had died a bit 
so it was back on with the engine, but the next morning minds were active and 
we finally solved the problems we had - by inventing a load of new flying sails 
which could take the rolling sea and the light airs we were having. Starting 
with the poled jib we had had up all night, we added a mizzen staysail using 
our intermediate jib, then flew a fisherman's by hoisting another old jib 
upside down between the top of the mizzen and the main topmast. We finished off 
our creation by putting up a double reefed mizzen, and it all gave us an 
extremely comfortable 4-4&frac12; knots !<br>
<br>
Various incarnations of 
these sails did us very well for many days, and provided a much more relaxed 
rig than usual, able to accommodate the choppy seas and variable following 
winds that we experienced. During this time, there came an addition from Jay, 
since Rob was struggling for things of interest to put on the site, as not much 
changes from day to day.<br>
People often ask what kind of things we eat on an 
ocean passage and the truth is food becomes a very important part of the day 
with lots of preparation leading up to consumption. On this trip there has been 
the &#145;before the fresh meat ran out&#146; and the &#145;after&#146;. It has 
been an advantage having a trained butcher on board, Stuart, as he selected the 
fresh meat from the market and kept it going for ten days &#150; six days 
longer then we usually carry fresh meat in the fridge. During that time, we had 
stir fry x2, Bolognese, Goulash, Chilli Con Carne, pork with roasted 
vegetables, Boeuf Bourguignon, Kofte kebab burgers and finally Schnitzels 
&#150; tender beef pockets enclosing blue cheese filling, all absolutely 
delicious!<br>
 Those were some of the easy meals &#150; we were also catching 
a lot of Dorado so lunches were often fish salad, fish stew or Cerviche, 
supplemented by tinned pilchards or tuna if we had been unsuccessful. Since the 
meat ran out we have had Psychie&#146;s marrow, one of our favourites and a 
Merryn speciality, pasta and pesto, potato and onion curry with chapattis, 
curry pasties (Mikes first and highly successful attempt at pastry), eggs in 
coconut curry sauce; lunches have been various salads, marrow soup, tomato 
soup, cumber and cream cheese mouse, this all interspersed with banana 
milkshake, banana fritters, banana in caramel sauce, banana bread, banana and 
chocolate chip muffins, banana crisps, flapjacks, date and walnut loaf, and 
fruit salads, pineapple, melon, banana, oranges and watermelon. The passion 
fruit all had to be made into juice after about four days worth of fruit salads 
but the wonderfully juicy Galapagos oranges are still going strong even though 
we&#146;ve had freshly squeezed orange juice every day &#150; the big sack we 
brought should last us to Fatu Hiva.<br>
I haven&#146;t mentioned the breads 
&#150; Mike&#146;s olive bread, Rob&#146;s now perfected fisherman&#146;s bread 
(spongy half-brown half-white bread previously cooked in a pan but now more 
successfully in the oven), brown rolls, white baps, white plaited bread, 
wholemeal loaf and plenty of pancakes, Stu&#146;s speciality. Unfortunately the 
bananas are virtually past it, maybe one more day&#146;s worth of squashy ones, 
and the rest will be fish food but we still have grapefruit, watermelon, 
oranges and lemons before we have to supplement with tins of fruit.<br>

I&#146;m planning a vegetable mousakka for tonight with marrow/pumpkin slices 
instead of aubergine, with cabbage, onions, beans and tomato as a sauce, plus a 
packet of mushroom soup instead of the B&eacute;chamel sauce &#150; we&#146;ll 
see how it turns out! We still have the lentil rissoles, enchiladas with 
refried beans and Rob&#146;s popular Aloo Saag to anticipate and no doubt other 
inspirations.<br>
 Needless to say that since we ran out of meat we 
haven&#146;t caught a single fish &#150; the line is still trawled every day 
with our selection of trusty lures, all now proven (except the most expensive 
and largest fish one, which has attracted two monster strikes, but lost both of 
them), the blue rattling squid, Ian&#146;s red squid and the 
&#145;Tormentor&#146; have all done some serious business.<br>
 There has also 
been a selection of breakfasts &#150; fruit salads and hot rolls, toast, 
scrambled eggs on toast, French toast with bacon, full English &#150; sausage, 
bacon, eggs, baked beans, tomatoes, mushrooms (I can&#146;t remember what 
we&#146;d done to deserve that one), pancakes with lemon, maple syrup and 
sugar; omelette with bacon, pepper an onion and home made muesli (oats soaked 
overnight with dried fruit).<br>
If you think we (or I, corrects Merryn) sound 
rather food orientated you are probably right but you know what they say &#150; 
an army marches on it&#146;s stomach &#150; well so too does a boat crew 
crossing the Pacific!<br>
<br>
The pumpkins were becoming a bit like the banana 
situation, since the small chunk out of the pictured pumpkin did one meal, and 
we had four whole pumpkins - there followed the usual pumpkin soup, roasted 
Mediterranean pumpkin, pumpkin lasagne, etc for a while. Merryn managed to find 
a bag of flour that had been invaded by a load of wriggly weevils, which we 
considered briefly for their protein, but decided to sift them out of the flour 
before using it for bread.<br>
<br>
The next few days saw much sail work as the 
winds became squally and unreliable and we spent large portions of days and 
nights putting up and taking down sails, until we got bored, stuck out a few 
small ones that would not flap when the wind was light, and stuck the engine 
on! Rob and Mike made use of one particularly torrential squall early one 
morning for an alfresco shower, but generally the rain wasn't too welcome.<br>

<br>The mileage was now rapidly decreasing below 1000 miles to go, and we 
changed our clock back for the second time in the journey, to GMT-9 (the same 
as Alaska). The last five days were mostly very light winds, so most of the 
work was done under engine, and were much the same, with occasional drizzle 
here and there, and occasional bursts of wind that made us hopeful, before they 
died away again.<br>
 The only event during the last part of the journey was 
Rob and Merryn's first wedding anniversary, which Jay somehow found a whole 
load of nice nibbles to make a very good lunch for !<br>
<br>
With two days to 
do we maintained a slightly slower speed that would get us into Fatu Hiva early 
morning, rather than in the middle of the night, and so at 03:20am on the 25th 
May, Merryn spotted a large lump twenty miles in front of us in the bright 
moonlight, which we watched getting larger and brighter as the sun came up.<br>

<br>To get up to Hanavave Bay where we were going to anchor, we skirted around 
the bottom of the island, and went up most of the west side, watching the 
beautiful scenery reveal itself as the sun rose.<br>
<br>
We reached the Bay of 
Virgins (apparently renamed by horrified missionaries from the Bay of Phalli, 
due to the shape of the rock columns) and after a couple of circuits around the 
crowded anchorage (14 boats!) we dropped anchor just after 10am. We had made 
our run of over 3000 miles in 23 days, which was almost a week sooner than we 
thought we would make it, and had been blessed with fantastic winds for almost 
half of the run! Here is a very interesting graph of our daily progress (there 
wasn't much to do!!)<br>
<br>
Hanavave Bay lived up to its reputation, with 
breathtaking views of massive steep sided valleys and overhanging rock 
pinnacles balanced over the town. The locals were very friendly, but it was 
strange to hear everyone speaking French again, especially since everyone 
looked more like Maoris than Frenchmen!<br>
<br>
After a stroll around the 
town, Jay and Stuart found the shop and a friendly local who brought us a huge 
sack of fresh fruit. We finally got some butter (which we had ran out of a week 
before) and a couple of other essential items at the tiny town shop, but since 
we had no French Polynesian Francs, we bartered a couple of boxes of cheap 
wine, which everyone was happy with. The next morning a local called Philippe 
took us to Omoa Bay, the main town on the island in his boat, an outrigger 
canoe, passing a big crack in some rock on the way.<br>
<br>
We had read about 
a walk from Omoa to Hanavave, which goes over the top of the mountain ranges, 
and is a distance of 10 miles, so we intended to walk back that way - a good 
way to see the best of the scenery and stretch our legs a little after three 
weeks on the boat. After a wander around the town, where we found some Brie, 
French bread and Pate for our lunch, we started off on the climb at about 
eleven, steeply ascending the valley wall above the town.<br>
<br>
The track of 
beaten earth went steeply up and up and up until we had to stop for lunch and a 
rest several hours later, not yet at the top, but with a fantastic view over 
the sea.<br>
<br>
It had become fairly obvious that we had not brought enough 
water with us, since we had drunk all that we had in the sweltering heat, so we 
had to wait several hours until we finally found a muddy trickle and were able 
to fill up the water bottles.<br>
<br>
The walk back down to Hanavave was no 
less tiring, since it was fairly steep and the road deteriorated, but the views 
as we went back into the deep valley were amazing, and once we were able to see 
the boat from way up high.<br>
<br>
The next day there was not much movement, 
since our legs hurt, but Merryn was at the washing machine most of the day, and 
various other boat maintenance occurred. We had heard that, the next morning, 
there was a special Mother's Day dance at the primary school, and so we went 
along to see the kids perform.<br>
<br>
Stuart went off with some young 
American guys who had sailed here on a 26-foot boat for a hike through the 
jungle, and Mike went off in search of the various statues and skulls reputed 
to lie about the jungle according to some of the books we had read, although he 
was not successful. The next day, Rob, Merryn and Jay went off to find the 
waterfall that Mike had reached, and had a lovely swim and wash in the cool 
water.<br>
<br>
Another day of relaxation, then it was good bye to the Bay of 
Virgins, and off towards Hiva Ova, the largest island in the southern group, 
not before an hour of battling with the anchor winch which had decided to 
misbehave and keep jamming the anchor chain around it. This is a map of our 
progress through the islands over the following few weeks.<br>
<br>
We made 
reasonable progress with all sails up, until we were suddenly hit by a big 
squall coming over one of the islands. We had expected torrential rain, but not 
the amount of wind it contained, and all of a sudden we were tearing along at 9 
knots, at which point we soon after thought it a good idea to somewhat 
belatedly take down our biggest jib before something bad happened to the mast! 
With such assistance, we made it to Atuona, the main town on Hiva Ova, just 
before dark and anchored in the small bay full of other sailing boats.<br>
<br>

That night the French Navy patrol boat moored in the bay generously invited 
everyone in the anchorage to a barbeque, where they provided free food and red 
wine, and we had a good time chatting to them and the other boat people, and 
even had a tour around the patrol boat by the captain. Making our way to the 
town the next morning we were pleased to find facilities such as a bank and 
shops, although we were a bit horrified by the prices - gone were the stupidly 
cheap Ecuadorian prices and here to stay until New Zealand were the island 
prices, often about 5 times more!<br>
 The town also had a tohua, a traditional 
meeting place with carved pillars in the centre.<br>
<br>
We were tired of the 
hideously rolly anchorage with dirty water, so we left late the next morning to 
find ourselves a nice secluded beach on the far side of Tahuata island, after 
stocking up on some fresh vegetables and other essentials, and trying again to 
do immigration at the Gendarmerie, which had decided not to open that morning.
<br> Three hours later, and we had anchored in a beautiful small bay complete 
with lovely sandy beach and palm trees, and a relaxing afternoon was spent 
swimming in the clear water, followed by a barbeque with good French sausage.
<br><br>
It was off again the next morning, only a few miles South to Hanatefau 
Bay, near the village of Hapatoni, where Noel and Co. had spent a few days and 
had recommended.<br>
<br>
Here we met Richard, who has a hut in the bay, who 
showed us around the village and the restored pae pae, the ancient stone 
foundations in the centre of the village, and a petroglyph.<br>
<br>
There was 
a 3-day fete to raise money for the church on at the village, which we were 
invited to. The fete seemed to generally involve lots of eating and sitting 
around, playing of boules, and lots of practice for a music and drama show put 
on by each village attending the event.<br>
<br>
We ended up staying for five 
days in the end, several more than we had expected, since it was such a 
pleasant quiet spot for Jay to devour several books, Mike to spend most of his 
time spear fishing and for us all to get to know Richard and a few of his 
friends, Frederick and Timau. In fact, Stuart got on so well with them that he 
decided to stay for a few months, and left the boat !<br>
<br>
While Merryn and 
Rob took a walk to the neighbouring village, which didn&#146;t look far but 
ended up being a tough and sweaty climb up the steep road for half the day, 
Mike speared his biggest catch yet, a Trevelly fish that was to feed us for 
several days!<br>
<br>
We finally left Hanatefau as four crew on the 5th June 
for an overnight sail to Nuku Hiva, waving goodbye to Stuart, left to live in 
Richard's hut in the bay.<br>
<br>
The next morning, after a windless night 
under engine, uneventful except for a few dawn showers to wake us up, we 
arrived in Taiohae Bay, the main town on Nuku Hiva. Over the course of our four 
day stay, we all (even Jay!) finally used the internet for the first time in 
over a month, had a good look around town and stocked up on fresh provisions. 
Rob ended up spending the best part of two days inside in the internet 
caf&eacute; uploading the website data for the update, which is usually 
complete in half a day - the internet was not fast, but better than nothing! We 
also had cause to buy more beer - our huge stock from Panama finally ended, and 
so it was back to normal prices for beer - a great shame, but certainly nothing 
to discourage consumption. We also realised that we had been a bit unsociable 
lately, and invited people of a few boats over for before dinner drinks which 
somehow turned into drinks instead of dinner. We left Taiohae Bay for a more 
remote anchorage on the North East side of the island the next morning, sailing 
in tandem with Richard on his boat Shamaal who took Jay on board as crew for 
the day.<br>
<br>
The anchorage was beautifully protected and smooth, the views 
wonderful, and there were just the two of us there to enjoy it. Early the next 
morning Jay, Richard, Merryn and Mike set off on a walk to see what we had been 
told were the best ancient remains on the Marquesas, climbing over the saddle 
into the next bay which afforded a good view of our boats.<br>
<br>
Both Rob 
and Mike had been feeling a little strange over the last week, with between the 
two of them - muscle fatigue, tingling feet and lips, upset stomach and 
strange, painful and long lasting leg aches bad enough to interrupt sleep, and 
so Rob didn't feel that his legs were up to the walk. We wondered whether they 
had both eaten enough of the large Trevelly fish to catch a mild version of 
fish poisoning, the bad cases of which result in paralysis and death, but were 
unsure since the symptoms had not occurred immediately after eating the fish!
<br> Back on the walk, the restored sites of Hikokua, Kanuihei and Tahakia were 
impressive, with statues (tiki) and foundation stones (paepae) on a large scale.
<br><br>
After a quick stop at the ice cream shop in Hatihee village, it was 
back over the hill to the boats.<br>
<br>
For another few days we passed the 
time mostly relaxing and eating, having Richard on board as dinner guest most 
evenings. For those of you who mentioned that Rob was long overdue for a 
haircut, you will be pleased to note that Merryn finally got to it and gave it 
the chop.<br>
<br>
Since we had last filled up our tanks in the Galapagos, we 
were running very low on drinking water, even though we had made it last a 
little longer by filling up jerry cans with non-drinkable water for washing in 
Fatu Hiva. We had been unable to find water of drinking quality on a wharf to 
easily fill our tanks, so we had to finally concede that it was hauling water 
by dingy and jerry can, and since this part of the island was mostly 
uninhabited, the water available from a standpipe near the beach tasted good. 
Mike and Rob set to work and seven round trips and half a day later, each time 
with five jerry cans, all tanks were full and Mike and Rob's arms were 
considerably longer!<br>
 Before departure the next morning, Merryn and Rob 
went for a walk over the saddle the other side of the bay, finding a nice beach 
but not having any luck in locating the oldest remains in the Marquesas, which 
were supposed to be around somewhere.<br>
<br>
Jay accompanied Richard in 
Shamaal again, and the remaining Lista Light crew followed a few hours later, 
making it into Daniel's Bay back on the south side by nightfall, after a scenic 
route around the remote northern side of the island.<br>
<br>
We were up bright 
and early for yet another walk, this time to see the third largest waterfall in 
the world, which can be reached after a two hour hike through the forest. The 
best view was from about half way there, but the bottom part of the waterfall 
was obscured by rock formations, in a similar way that most of the waterfall 
was obscured when we arrived there.<br>
<br>
A quick cooling dip in the water, 
and a power shower for Mike, Richard and Jay, then lunch shared with Daniel's 
dog Makaka who had been an excellent tour guide and showed us the way. After 
returning to the boat, we did another water run to top up all tanks, then Mike 
cooked a beautiful pie with roast potatoes that went down very well - Richard 
was heard to comment that he hadn't had roast potatoes that good since his 
mother died twelve years ago!!<br>
<br>
The next morning back round to Taiohae 
Bay, where we took on some extra diesel to make sure we could make it through 
to Tahiti on what we had, then anchored up again in the bay. After internet and 
provisioning, we left a few days later for the Tuamotu island/atol of Manihi, 
followed by Ahe and Rangiroa, spending around a month before arriving in 
Tahiti, next update whenever possible!!<br>
<br>
Before leaving the Marquesas, 
we got a weather forecast (for once!) both from Richard via his SSB radio, and 
the internet, and both showed favourable (Easterly to South-Easterly) strongish 
wind (15-20 knots) for the 4-5 days of our passage, which was good to know and 
exactly what gets Lista Light going along well. We weighed anchor early on the 
17th June and headed out of Tahiohae Bay, immediately feeling the wind as we 
cleared the land and raising the mainsail, staysail, mizzen and medium jib for 
a broad reach which gave us a comfortable 6-7 knots. The wind was fairly 
constant and the sailing good until around dawn the next morning, when it eased 
off to the point where the engine was required for a while, but a few hours 
later we were off again at 5-6 knots, which is where it stayed for 48 hours.<br>
 It was slightly more effort with just four of us, our overnight watches being 
2 people on for 4 hours, off for 4 hours, but it wasn't uncomfortable with some 
extra sleep top-up during the day as we went. We also changed our normal one 
hour on, three off rotating day steering rota to a two hour shift, which gave 
us six hours off in the day and a bit more time to get things done between 
watches.<br>
 Following the recent hair chop theme, Merryn got her scissors out 
again and attacked Jay, and Rob busied himself with his grooming, in keeping 
with his posh new look.<br>
<br>
The weather stayed clear and sunny, and the 
wind kept on blowing - perfect sailing weather, but by the 20th we realised 
that we were making time too well, and that we would arrive early for the 
correct tide state for entry into the lagoon through the pass. The wind 
freshened a little and we ended up running under double reefed mainsail alone, 
trying to slow our progress! The fresher wind also carried squalls and some 
heavy rain too, and we started to think that the sea would be too big to 
attempt the passage into the lagoon at all, and changed course for Ahe, where 
the pass is more protected and the sea would hopefully be calmer by the time we 
arrived there. We also had one minor disruption of another steering cable 
snapping whilst Merryn was on night watch, fortunately Rob had crafted a 
slightly better emergency tiller than the one we had previously used whilst 
crossing the Pacific as the seas were a lot bigger. The decision was made to 
fix it there and then so that we could make it to the atoll at the right tide 
window, and because steering 35 tons worth of boat isn't that easy with a 
tiller, so Rob hung over the side harnessed on whilst Jay fed the new cable 
through and Mike and Merryn took it in turns to steer. Merryn commented that it 
would not be the type of task you would like to undertake with a hernia (as one 
of our friends had done previously on their boat) but as consolation was very 
excited about the six pack that she would be parading the next day - 
unfortunately it never transpired and all there was to show was a few bruises!
<br><br>
Apart from the steering cable mishap, all in all it was another good 
(and lucky) sail for Lista Light; boats who had left a week before hadn't had a 
breath of wind, and boats who left the week before that had 50mph gales in the 
Tuamotus!<br>
The Tuamotus consist of about 77 atolls and islands stretching 
over 1000 miles, an atoll being a low lying fringing coral reef built on the 
remains of a volcano with a salt water lagoon in the middle; the Tuamotu atols 
range in size from a few miles across to over 50 miles long. The low lying 
landscape was a sharp contrast to the steep rocky terrain of the Marquesas; in 
time, as the Marquesan mountains erode and the coral reef around them grows, 
the relatively young Marquesas will end up being atols similar to the Tuamotus.
<br><br>
There are usually one or more 'passes' in this coral reef that enables 
boats to enter into the lagoon where it is more sheltered from the ocean waves 
and there is some amazing coral. The main industry of these atolls is the 
farming of black pearls from odd little sheds on stilts, with trails of rope 
holding pearls criss-crossing the lagoon.<br>
<br>
There are very strong 
currents and rips that flow out of the passes in the lagoons depending on both 
the state of the tide and how rough the seas are outside the lagoon - if the 
sea is rough the waves spill over the reef in some places filling the lagoon 
and the easiest way out for the extra water is to rush through the pass. 
Despite our running repairs and deviations due to the weather, we still managed 
to arrive slightly before what we had worked out to be the correct time of day 
to enter the pass, although unfortunately it was also spring tides, which means 
that the outflow from the lagoon is at its strongest and the seas were also 
relatively large due to constant 20 knots of wind for the previous 3 or 4 days 
that we had enjoyed. This meant for a pretty hairy entry into the lagoon - of 
course this is the highlight of the day for the locals who spectate from the 
edge of the pass as the novice yachties get swirled around and fight the 
outflow of the lagoon! We had our trusty engine up at full blast as we inched 
forward against 6 knots of outflow at the narrowest point, and once through the 
pass, which is about 500m long, we had to quickly reduce speed to prevent 
ourselves piling into one of the numerous coral heads.<br>
<br>
The little bits 
of 'land' around the outside of the lagoon are called Motu's and these are 
joined by patches of awash coral, together making the outside of the atol.<br>

<br>We carried on around to the south side of the lagoon, and anchored in calm 
lagoon water behind a large motu for protection, which was a lovely change from 
the bumpy sea of the last few days.<br>
<br>
After a day or two of complete 
relaxation and solitude, Merryn and Rob ventured to town to have a look around. 
Although the town itself wasn't anything to write home about, we were very 
pleased to find a lettuce (the first one for ages!!) in the shop, and we 
enjoyed watching the local boats zooming through the pass with the ebb current. 
Shopping in remote Pacific islands isn't like going to Tesco's - there is a 
severe lack of anything remotely fresh or vegetable or salad-like, and what 
there is has been frozen, costs the earth and goes off instantly!<br>
<br>

There was a large smart hotel on one side of the lagoon, where our guide book 
said bikes could be hired for a 6km ride along a track; however when we asked 
at the hotel we were informed that the bikes were now for guests only, so that 
put paid to that idea!<br>
<br>
Several days later of doing not much at all, 
and we were ready to depart for our next stop, Ahe. After much tidal 
calculation we decided to leave at 8am, but unfortunately the anchor chain had 
got badly stuck around some coral heads and despite lots of manoeuvring in a 
vain attempt to unwind ourselves, Rob ended up getting the scuba gear on and 
directing movement from 20m below! All this shenanigans made us over an hour 
late for slack water at the pass, but there was an outflow which actually made 
the exit from the pass easier, carrying us along smoothly out to sea.<br>
<br>

The day's sail was rather showery, windless and gloomy, but we made it under 
engine only to Ahe by 3pm and enjoyed a smooth entry with 1 knot of tidal flow, 
and carried on down through the lagoon to the anchorage near the village of 
Taukapara.<br>
<br>
There were only three other boats anchored there, which was 
surprising considering it's reputation as a popular stop by yachties, and after 
a walk around town and a snorkel near the boat, we decided to push on the next 
day to the relative civilisation of Rangiroa, the quiet anchorage in Ahe being 
pretty similar to Manihi. Meanwhile, Rob took advantage of the quiet water of 
the lagoon to do a quick job at the top of the topmast whilst he wasn't flung 
around like a pendulum.<br>
<br>
Weighing anchor late that afternoon and 
raising staysail and main for a sail up the lagoon, we exited the pass against 
3 knots of inflow, the sails helping to steady the boat and give a little extra 
push against the current. The overnight sail of 80 miles to Rangiroa was 
largely uneventful, the light following wind requiring a night of engine 
assistance to make enough headway to arrive at Rangiroa's Tiputa pass by 8am, 
where we had 3 knots of inflow current driving us comfortably through the pass. 
We anchored off the Kia Ora hotel in beautiful turquoise water, a popular 
anchorage with some fiveteen other boats already there.<br>
<br>
The main 
inhabited part of Rangiroa consists of two villages at either end of the 6km 
spit of land between the two main passes into the lagoon. Pensions, pearl shops 
and snack bars and restaurants abound along the road between the two villages, 
which we negotiated with bikes hired for the day, which was a bit of a shock to 
the muscles! We had a well earned sundowner at the Kia Ora hotel, with a 
beautiful view of the sunset over the lagoon, and some excellent food at a 
local restaurant.<br>
<br>
After a slow day relaxing and getting some laundry 
done, Mike and Rob braved the current in the pass the next morning and did a 
drift snorkel through from the reef outside into the lagoon, during which Rob 
was happy to finally see his first shark at close quarters - it was only a 
five-foot reef shark but Rob was happy anyway!<br>
<br>
Leaving beautiful 
Rangiroa was a bit of a wrench, but we had decided to visit Moorea first before 
turning back to Tahiti, so that we had more time when we left Tahiti to explore 
the other Society Islands. One last photo of the bay&#133;<br>
<br>
&#133; and 
we weighed anchor late in the afternoon of the 29th June, and headed out to the 
pass. We waited for another boat to come in through the pass, just making it in 
under full sail against the current, and then zoomed out with 4 knots of flow 
pushing us along. There were some standing waves and chop where the outflow 
from the lagoon met the sea, but since we were being carried along with the 
current it was all relatively smooth and we were duly spat out of the lagoon 
without any problems.<br>
<br>
 It immediately started to rain torrentially, 
which was never far away in the next 24 hours, everyone getting a thorough 
soaking at various points in the crossing to Moorea. The wind was reasonable 
most of the time, although it wasn't consistent enough with the rain squalls 
around to sail properly overnight without attention, so a few small sails were 
employed with engine help. We managed all of five hours without engine during 
the next day, until the wind eased off again in the afternoon, the sky 
remaining overcast the entire time.<br>
<br>
Running all night under mizzen and 
medium jib, with engine assistance, we caught our first view of Tahiti and 
Moorea as dawn broke, passing Tahiti to Port, we carried on to Cook's Bay, 
Moorea.<br>
<br>
This is a map of the Society islands, with our completed 
journey so far, and the intended route through the rest of the islands.<br>
<br>
We were anchored by lunchtime, among another eight boats, and after a wander 
around being delighted by the availability of supermarkets containing fresh veg 
and other forgotten items, managed to find a wonky palm tree just in time for 
sunset.<br>
<br>
The next morning Rob and Merryn set off in a 'Bugxster' for an 
around-the-island drive, Merryn though seemed a little more interested in the 
shops that the scenery - in fact both Merryn and Jay were finally able to buy 
new bikinis that morning, a matter which had obviously been disturbing them 
both for some time. The road tour led to some pretty spectacular views - Tahiti 
and most of the Society islands have both mountains and fringing coral reefs, a 
little like the Marquesas and the Tuamotus put together; this allows a good 
perspective over the beautiful colours in the water!<br>
<br>
The road around 
the island takes no more than several hours, but with a stop at a lookout point 
in the mountains and a stop at most shops that we passed, Merryn and Rob 
returned to the boat tired and slightly shaken from the go-kart's suspension.
<br><br>
Mike had threatened to go hiking in the mountains, but was still on 
board the boat, having made a u-turn and stayed in bed most of the day instead, 
although the day after he took to the hills and walked all over the island on 
mountain tracks.<br>
<br>
After 4 days we decided that it was time for a change 
of scenery, so we motored around the North East corner of the island and 
anchored inside the reef on the East side, in beautiful light blue water.<br>

<br>At this point the camera, which had been rather temperamental for the 
previous few weeks (causing us to miss most good pictures, hence the worse than 
usual quality of our pictures) decided to break once and for all - electronic 
items do not fare very well in salty corrosive sea air, and the inevitable 
finally happened. Luckily we were able to steal photos off a variety of people 
to finish off this section!<br>
 We spent a few more uneventful days on Moorea, 
snorkelling over the nearby reef and with Mike and Jay walking to see a 
waterfall, and then carried on to Pape'ete, Tahiti, a short ten mile journey 
across the channel. Unfortunately the wind had got up to a reasonable F4-5 that 
morning, and so we motored directly into the wind and waves, the two-hour 
journey ending up taking almost double the time. As we were about to enter the 
main pass into Pape'ete harbour, the fishing line went - we had caught a 
massive 4-foot long Dorado, which Mike struggled aboard - no picture of our 
biggest fish by far though, due to the camera problems. It was extremely good 
eating, doing five people three meals when wastefully filleted!<br>
 After all 
the excitement and the fish was finally subdued we headed down past the airport 
inside the reef and anchored near the marina, and took a bus up to town to have 
a look around. The excitement of being near a large city ended up to be too 
much, and so the next morning we moved up to the dock in the centre of town, 
very convenient for all the shops and exploring the city, and just like home, 
next to a main road!<br>
<br>
Tahiti has a month-long festival during June and 
July, and so there were many cultural events going on during our stay, mostly 
dancing and music based, but also sports such as rowing and stone lifting, 
which were entertaining to watch, although it was sometimes difficult to work 
out what was happening and who had won!<br>
<br>
Jay left for her 3-week 
holiday in England after a few days in Pape'ete, and several days later saw the 
disreputable sailing vessel Skardu turn up ( www.skardu.net ) , who we had met 
in the Marquesas for a few drinks. Alcohol consumption on a dangerous scale 
ensued, mostly due to the lethal house cocktail, resulting in many ridiculous 
antics which included Merryn falling into the dock, and Noel and Jo sleeping in 
a building site on the way home with Noel's good friend Swampy.<br>
<br>
There 
was plenty of time to try out the famous Tahiti surf; Rob and Morton from 
Blaatur ( www.blaatur.net ) had a good time in Papara, an hour's hitch away, 
but hardly got to professional status!<br>
<br>
Before running around the 
island to leave the boat in Port Phaeton, a protected bay on the south side of 
the island, we finally invited the entire crew of Endelig, the boat that Noel 
and Jo are on, round to dinner.<br>
<br>
Now Merryn and Rob's turn to leave for 
the UK for wedding attendance, we motored around to the protected bay on the 
south side, leaving Mike in charge for the duration of our stay in England.<br>

 Upon our return, Mike had been very busy and sanded and varnished the entire 
cockpit, which looked lovely; unfortunately, this also made everything else 
look awful, so a few days later Jay got to work sanding the rail, only slightly 
interrupted at times by torrential rain.<br>
<br>
Port Phaeton is certainly the 
wetter side of the island, but the smooth still water is lovely and calm as an 
anchorage, and creates beautiful reflections of the sunrise.<br>
<br>
After 
four or five days of boat maintenance by all, with Rob fitting all of the 
difficult to obtain parts that he had brought back from England, we retraced 
our course back to Pape'ete and anchored off the marina near the airport, ready 
for our next set of guests - Ian, Matt and Polly due to arrive a few days later.
<br> In the meantime Mike had decided that it was time to move onto other 
things, so he left the boat just before Ian, Matt and Polly arrived early the 
next morning. Although the weather was bad overnight, with strong wind and 
rain, by the next morning it was bright again, although the wind was still very 
strong, and we were grateful to be tied up safely to the wall of the marina!<br>
<br>We took a few days to get everyone settled in, and after stocking up with 
beer and food, and showing the new crew around the now familiar sights of 
Pape'ete, such as the colourful market, we sailed across to Moorea.<br>
<br>
We 
anchored at the mouth of Cook's Bay in shallow tuquiose water, where we were 
able to take a short dingy ride to the reef or just look out for rays gliding 
past the boat.<br>
<br>
Some light exercise and a climb up the nearby mountain 
Rotui turned into a sweaty scramble up steep and slippery paths and walks along 
razor-back ridges, but gave fantastic views over the reef and other mountains 
of Moorea.<br>
<br>
We were forced to turn back without making it to the top, 
and slid back down to a nice cool drink at the Sheritan hotel at the bottom.<br>
 After another day relaxing we set sail in the evening for Huahine, making 
fairly slow progress with light breeze overnight, skirting around the bottom of 
the island and sailing well for the last hour with a stiff land breeze.<br>
<br>
We followed the channel between the reef and the land down to the bottom corner 
of the island, where we anchored in a quiet bay with a few other boats, and 
went out to a local bar for a few drinks that evening.<br>
<br>
Off again the 
next morning we travelled up to the main town on Huahine for a different 
anchorage at the side of the northern pass, and after a good snorkel took a 
walk into the forest that afternoon to find some vanilla plants, which Huahine 
is famous for. After a good climb into the jungle we still hadn't found 
anything, so we hurried back down to the town to catch happy hour at the 
dockside bar, which soon turned into several more drinks as we waited out some 
heavy rain.<br>
<br>
Soon after dawn the following morning we were motoring out 
of the pass towards Raiatea; we raised mizzen, staysail, jib and double reefed 
main (due to light wind flapping rather than strong wind) and made it across in 
less than three hours. After entering through pass Iriru, we followed Noel's 
reccomendation and anchored behind a lovely little motu, anchoring stern-to the 
shore and running a line to a palm tree since the beach was steeply shelving.
<br><br>
There was much lazing about and exploring of the motu, and that 
evening Matt and Rob made a huge fire, which cooked sausages and home-made 
burgers, all washed down by a few beers.<br>
<br>
The stiff breeze that had 
fanned the flames of the beach fire the night before disappeared during next 
morning, and so swarms of mosquitos and tiny flies made the short journey to 
the boat, hastening our departure just after breakfast to follow the channel 
all the way up around the top of Raiatea, and then up the west side of Tahaa to 
anchor in Bay Hurepiti, narrowly missing going aground on a shelf at the head 
of the bay by some sharp looking-out and a rather hastily applied full astern.
<br> Ian, Matt, Merryn and Rob took a 4km walk over the steep hill to the other 
side of the island to find some fresh food for the night's meal, giving a good 
view of the bays either side of the island.<br>
<br>
Off at the crack of dawn 
the next morning, we motor sailed across to Bora Bora, around the bottom and up 
to the pass on the west side, admiring the view of the reef and the mountain 
behind.<br>
<br>
The route to the out-of-the-way south-eastern anchorage took 
us all the way round the top and back down the other side of Bora Bora, through 
some scarilly shallow channels at only 0.8m depth below us at one point, but 
more beautiful colours in the shallow waters.<br>
<br>
We eventually found our 
way to the anchorage, where Rob finally got to practice kite surfing again with 
Morten (sadly the last time we will see him) and we were able to practice our 
Sambucca drinking skills with Noel, Jo and Morten that evening, which as usual 
turned out to be a very bad idea the next day.<br>
<br>
Time was pressing so we 
were off again that afternoon, back along the shallow channel around Bora Bora 
and anchored off the reef just before sunset.<br>
<br>
We were up with the dawn 
the next morning, and having completed the journey to the main town, Vitape, we 
were anchored and had set off by 8am to climb the Bora Bora mountain.<br>
 The 
first part of the climb was an arduous hour-long steep climb through the 
forest&#133;<br>
<br>
&#133;followed by scrambling along narrow paths and up 
steep sections where helpful people had strung ropes for support, with 
occasional glimpses of the view through the trees.<br>
<br>
We finally arrived 
at the first summit, hot and sweaty, after an hour and a half of solid 
climbing, and had a short rest&#133;<br>
<br>
&#133;before carrying on along 
the ridge to the top of the climbable part of the mountain.<br>
<br>
The views 
from the top were amazing, and we managed to get a few photos in just before a 
cloud rolled in and blanketed us and the view.<br>
<br>
We could just about 
make out Lista Light, at full camera zoom, anchored below us in the bay.<br>

<br>After our mountain climb, and Matt and Polly's day-long bike ride around 
the island, there was call for refreshment that evening, so we moved a few 
miles down to the south end of the island, and anchored near Bloody Mary's Bar. 
It was a bit cheesy, with boards naming all the famous guests that had ate 
there, but the barbequed fish was extremely good eating and we all enjoyed our 
dinner immensely.<br>
<br>
A late start the next morning (especially by Matt!) 
and taking on of water and diesel through the day set us up for an evening 
departure towards Raratonga, 535 miles away.<br>
<br>
We started our 535 mile 
trip to Rarotonga, Cook Islands, by motoring straight into the sunset and a 
light breeze, enjoying the view of Bora Bora, our last stop in French 
Polynesia, recede as the sun set.<br>
<br>
By 3am the next morning the wind had 
come around enough for a few sails close hauled, but we still needed engine 
help to make good progress until the evening when with all sails up, the engine 
went off and we managed to make a respectable 5-6 knots on course.<br>
<br>
As 
usual, the window for perfect sailing is small, and by 3am Rob was running 
around the deck in his boxer shorts easing sheets as we were hit by a few 
stronger spells of wind taking us up to 8 knots. By lunchtime the next day the 
wind was consistently force 5, and we took down the jib and reefed the 
mainsail, and by the evening we were zooming along under force 6 winds, with 
just storm jib and double reefed main. Polly was not seen for a considerable 
amount of time, having taken refuge from the sight of the big waves down below!
<br><br>
We made very good progress over the five days of good wind, and had 
gone so well that we were going to arrive at night, so we were forced to slow 
down for the last part of the journey, just running along under the staysail 
and rolling around uncomfortably at low speed in the big swell. After several 
rain showers in the early morning, we arrived at Rarotonga and entered the 
harbour at about 10am, and moored stern-to along the dock. The harbour was 
packed full of boats, and so we ended up next to a cargo ship that was noisily 
loading up, which was due to go fairly soon, and had hit a yacht whilst 
manouvering on the way in!<br>
 Luckilly the cargo boat was delayed, and the 
next morning most of the boats left to carry on their journey, leaving plenty 
of room for the few boats remaining to moor well out of the way.<br>
<br>
 Ian, 
Polly and Matt wanted a quick look at the island before flying out that 
evening, so they rented a car and everyone except Rob (who stayed to look after 
the boat) went on a tour around Rarotonga, stopping at a waterfall on the way.
<br><br>
We took the opportunity of just the three of us on board to have a day 
cleaning the entire boat out, and Jay doing huge amounts of laundry. After 
working the whole day, we decided a drink was in order, so we invited some 
friends from neighbouring boats over for a drink or two.<br>
<br>
We spent a 
few more days relaxing, and a couple of nights socialising on other boats, 
including a rugby night, where we all went to a local bar and watched New 
Zealand play Australia. Sunday came and everything was closed, so we decided a 
long walk was required, and we headed off on the cross-island walk with Jack 
and Anna from a boat next to us.<br>
<br>
The 'walk' as usual consisted of 
scrambling up mountainsides clinging onto roots and trees &#133;<br>
<br>

&#133; but luckily we managed to acquire a friendly dog who seemed to know the 
way, and who was grateful for some of our food when we arrived at the waterfall 
on the other side of the island.<br>
<br>
We had been on the look-out for extra 
crew since Bora Bora, as we knew we would be down to 3 at Rarotonga; as luck 
would have it Jack, from the boat Dolittle next to us, needed to change boats 
since visitors were arriving, so he joined us just before we left Rarotonga.<br>
 It was then the usual rush to buy enough food for the next trip and fill up 
with water and fuel, before we left on the morning of the 6th September, headed 
for Niue, then the Vavau group, Tonga.<br>
<br>
We left Avatiu harbour, 
Rarotonga at lunchtime on the 6th September, after a last minute purchase of 
ten duty free cases of VB and other provisions for our 600 mile journey to 
Niue, assisted by our new crew Jack.<br>
<br>
Sailing was good for the first 
day, and we made good progress on a broad reach, but the wind died down 
slightly the next day and by the following evening some engine help was 
required. Just as dusk fell and Rob was winding in a fishing line, he realised 
that there was a fish on it and without any struggle from the fish landed it on 
board - a lovely yellow fin tuna, nice and plump!<br>
<br>
The tuna fed all of 
us steaks the first night, went in a fish stew the second night and was enough 
to feed nine people fish curry on the third night - a good catch! A large 
flying fish had also landed on deck the previous night and although small, was 
tasty after Merryn marinaded it in balsamic vinegar and soy sauce.<br>
<br>
We 
had decided, weather permitting, to stop at Beveridge reef, a tiny reef three 
miles across which is just off the direct track to Niue for a rest and a swim 
on the way. As we approached on the morning of the 10th September, the weather 
didn&#146;t look promising since it was overcast and showery, but we decided a 
good rest would be nice and went in anyway, joined a little later by Jack's 
previous boat, Dolittle.<br>
 We invited the Dolittle crew and the crew from 
another boat already at Beverdige reef over for beer and curry, and were 
entertained by stories of a shark bite a few years ago at Beveridge reef which 
required sixty stitches.<br>
<br>
Despite the shark story (backed up by Alan 
showing us the scar) we decided that a dive was a good idea the next morning, 
and set off out over the reef and into the water.<br>
<br>
Whilst the coral 
wasn't wonderful, since a hurricane hit last year, there was plenty of life, 
including a couple of white-tipped sharks to pester with Cees' underwater 
camera.<br>
<br>
After the morning dive, it was up anchor by noon and off to 
cover the remaining 130 miles to Niue, an excellent sail at 6-7 knots all 
afternoon and evening, although as usual it all failed at 2am and we had to 
take most of the sails down and continue under engine, with poled jib and 
reefed mizzen helping slightly, though mostly flapping in the light breeze. We 
motored around the bottom of Niue and up the west side to Alofi, where we 
picked up a mooring about an hour before dark.<br>
<br>
Niue is a 
self-governing island with links to New Zealand - it is low and flat, rising to 
only about 100m high, and has lots of caves and chasms around the coast. It 
suffered a devastating direct hit from hurricane Heta last year, and so pretty 
much everything is new, since the island was flattened during the storm, with 
waves climbing up 40m of cliff and sweeping over the land 10m high!<br>
<br>
As 
Jack and Merryn were exploring one end of town, they came across a motorbike 
rental shop, and came up with the plan of cruising around the island looking at 
all the beauty spots by bike. That evening the idea gathered momentum and 
people from several other boats wanted to join in, and the next morning we all 
ended up on six motorbikes zooming around the roads.<br>
<br>
First stop was a 
small pool and a cave&#133;<br>
<br>
...swiftly followed by a second and then a 
third pool at different stops, where we cooled off and had a quick snorkel.<br>

<br>The third pool was in a deep chasm, and the boys had fun climbing up the 
sides and jumping off into the water. We then walked for half an hour around to 
another small bay, where there were some amazing rock arches and we stopped for 
lunch.<br>
<br>
Cees (pictured above) was the second crewmember from Dolittle 
due to join us, and instead of waiting until Tonga he moved on board in Niue.
<br> After lunch we went right around to the other side of the island, Noel 
getting the prize for most careless riding by going over one village's central 
green after failing to navigate a sharp bend, and Cees winning the most 
dangerous under and over taking manouvre prize - somehow no-one was hurt and 
after a short walk, we were staring out over the sea on the jagged windward 
side of the island.<br>
<br>
The journey back to the main village was 
uneventful except for some large ice creams, then a sundowner at the Crazy Uga 
caf&eacute;.<br>
<br>
A day later, we slipped our mooring buoy, now a crew of 
six (five permanent members and also a hitch hiker from Niue Yacht Club to 
Tonga). The wind got up nicely as we left the shadow of the island, and a few 
miles out we put up main, mizzen, staysail and big jib and were going along 
very nicely at 6-7 kn, with Cees (pronounced like &quot;case&quot;) trying out 
the steering.<br>
<br>
Noel and the Endelig crew left a little after us, and 
after a few hours caught up with us for a photo session - requiring the topsail 
to be hoisted of course, and resulting in loads of excellent pictures of Lista 
Light sailing well.<br>
<br>
Phil from Niue Yacht Club wasn't having the best 
voyage, spending most of his time comatosed or sick, but the rest of us were 
enjoying the good sailing, until the wind died that evening and we continued 
for the night and the next day under goosewinged mizzen and staysail, with the 
engine assisting. The next morning, the dawn brought the first views of Tonga, 
and we caught up with another boat, Sanuk, for some more mutual picture-taking.
<br><br>
As we sailed around the north coast, we were lucky to have a sighting 
of a hump-backed whale and calf swimming the other way between us and the coast.
<br><br>
We carried on around to the west side, and then into the maze of small 
islands, inlets and reefs that is the Vava'u group, and up to Neiafu, the main 
town. Here we had to tie alongside the wharf until customs, quarrantine and 
immigration formalities were done, then we picked up a mooring buoy and headed 
off to Mermaids, the local bar.<br>
The next morning we explored the town and 
picked up some provisions; we went to the market for some fresh fruit and veg, 
and to &quot;Pete the Meat&quot; for some steaks and sausages for the barbie.
<br><br>
The Vava'u group is ideal for easy and relaxed cruising by boat, with 
lots of small islands all in an area about 30 miles across, which means more 
than 50 places to anchor all within an hour or two of each other. We left 
Neiafu that afternoon, and went to our first anchorage behind an island about 
an hour from the town. The next day Cees got his kiteboarding gear out, and had 
a good day zooming about, and was a lot more successful than our attempts at 
spearfishing which resulted in a net amount of zero fish.<br>
<br>
We were 
enticed to the hotel bar on the island by Happy hour, which ended up being a 
very late night, with lots of dancing and drinking, all helped along by the 
hospitality of the owner, who used to be the bass player in The Cure.<br>
<br>

The next afternoon, after a very slow start, we sailed around to our next 
anchorage, a short one hour journey, where we were joined by lots of other 
boats to celebrate Jay's birthday. Rob and Cees built a huge fire on the beach 
during the afternoon, and lit it just before sunset.<br>
<br>
A few hours later 
the fire had consumed vast amounts of fuel, and had died down enough to cook 
on; we all feasted on pan-fried fish and salads brought by all, and of course a 
few celebratory drinks. We were even gate-crashed by some local Tongans who 
were very helpful in keeping the fire burning, and climbed a tree to fetch and 
open us some coconuts when we ran out of mixer.<br>
<br>
The next day, after a 
quick clear-up on the beach, we motored the strenuous distance of a mile to the 
next anchorage, settling off a small beach off the end of a motu. Cees took 
advantage of the wind and beach combination in getting his kite out, and had a 
good afternoon session, while the rest of us enjoyed the sea life from the 
surface.<br>
<br>
Moving on again the next day, we were encouraged to a 
particular spot by an invitation to a hog roast - some people that we knew had 
bought an entire small pig from 'Pete the meat' and were roasting it on a spit. 
The usual yachtie rules applied - everyone bring a salad or something and we 
all dig in eating each other's food, often a welcome change from tired 
recipies! Unfortunately no-one remembered their cameras, so no pictures of the 
pig on the fire.<br>
 During the evening and overnight the weather 
deteriorated, and ended up cloudy and windy by the next day with some showers - 
we had been taking good weather for granted near the equator, and had to expect 
more changeable weather from now on, especially as we went down to New Zealand.
<br><br>
The next morning we went to a good snorkelling spot half an hour away 
in the dingy - called the Coral Gardens, it was once spectacular but was 
damaged in a cyclone in 1990 and has partially re-established itself. We were 
very excited to hear whalesong while we paddled about, and lots of blue 
starfish amongst the coral.<br>
<br>
Encouraged by the whalesongs that we had 
heared, we went on a three-hour roundabout sail to the next anchorage (which 
was 15 minutes away!), hoping to run into some whales on the way. The wind was 
strong, at least 25 knots (F6) so we had a good sail at times, although since 
we were going in a circle, we were beating into the wind and waves at times. We 
cicled around countless small islets and bigger patches of land, but 
unfortunately were not lucky, and missed the whales.<br>
<br>
After a pleasant 
night stop, luckilly helped out by being invited to Dolittle for dinner since 
we had practically nothing left on board to eat, we sailed around back up to 
the main port, Neiafu, getting absolutely drenched in the process by torrential 
rain. Luckily Cees had his trendy wet-weather gear and his waterproof hat to 
hand, and was slightly less wet than the rest of us.<br>
<br>
That night was 
the obligatory stop at The Mermaid for fish and chips and beer, and the next 
day was taken up with provisioning, internet, haircutting, checking out through 
customs and immigration, taking on water and clothes washing, all ready for a 
quick stay at an island on the west side of the Vava'u group, then on to Fiji, 
a four day sail.<br>
<br>
Map of the stopps taken so far in Tonga, and the way 
out towards Fiji<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
En route to our overnight stop to the west 
of the Vavau group, we first stopped off at the famous Mariner's cave - a cave 
entered by swimming down a few meters and along five meters into a rock face. 
The phenomenon created by the variations of pressure when waves hit the rocks 
is that a mist forms around you&#133;<br>
<br>
... then completely vanishes as 
the pressure changes - all very strange !<br>
<br>
The blue light coming into 
the cave through the underwater passage was impressive, from both on top of the 
water and underneath.<br>
<br>
After our small caving trip, we carried on to 
the island of Hunga, where we went through a small pass into the lagoon there - 
unfortunately the remainder of the afternoon and the next morning were overcast 
and rainy, but we went for an enjoyable snorkel in the lagoon pass the next 
morning, still hunting for the elusive whale experience!<br>
 By 3pm the tide 
was high enough to attempt leaving the lagoon, and we set off towards Fiji with 
a light following wind which was just enough to carry us along at a fair speed 
for an hour or two after we had left the wind shadow of the island.<br>
 We had 
got a weather forecast from a friend, and we were expecting SE wind, F5 to 
arrive, followed by less wind for a day, then NE F6 following a day or so later 
- the perfect amount of wind to get us sailing along nicely. However, just 
after midnight the wind swung around a few times, then suddenly got up, and 
carried on getting up, until we were bowling along with F8 winds, gusting up to 
40 knots, with enormous waves and spray everywhere. We had a reef in the main 
already, but we didn't have time to take any more, since we were trying to gybe 
as the wind got up and having problems with a caught running backstay - so we 
had to run under only one reef in the main, which was a lot more canvas than we 
needed, and a lot to attempt to pull down. A few tired looking birds had landed 
on deck a little earlier, which is not a common occurrence - we should have 
taken the hint that there was some bad weather coming ! By 3am, the wind had 
abated slightly, to F7, but we were left with a big sea and lots of rain, and 
we were still doing 7 knots with reefed mainsail only.<br>
<br>
The high winds, 
at least F5, stayed with us all day, together with lots of rain and cloud - we 
all got thoroughly wet and cold !<br>
<br>
The next evening we had more strong 
winds, up to F7 this time, and zoomed along over big waves again - this time we 
were more prepared for it and took three reefs in the main before things got 
too bad. By the next morning, things were looking better and by lunchtime we 
were going along nicely, with manageable wind and clear, sunny skies. That 
afternoon we passed through a passage in the reef between Tonga and Fiji, and 
were helped along by up to two knots of current. The sea had calmed down enough 
for the fish to see our lures, and we caught a large Mahi-Mahi which was 
delicious eating for several days.<br>
<br>
By midnight the wind had died 
enough to require engine, and the next day was hot and sunny, with very little 
wind - it was so hot the boys had to jump into the sea and act as shark-bait on 
a rope.<br>
<br>
The other entertainment of the day was passing the 
international date line (or where it should be anyway - 180 degrees West/East). 
This meant that we had travelled exactly half-way around the world since 
leaving England, taking 15 months and travelling somewhere in the region of 
15,000 miles at an average of 5-6 mph! Although we felt Neptune didn&#146;t 
deserve much in the way of offerings after the weather we'd had a few days 
before, we gave him a can of beer over the side to show willing, and then 
carried on with the arduous tasks of the day.<br>
<br>
The last night of the 
passage was fairly dull and windless, with the odd squall and torrential rain 
to keep us on our toes. The GPS, which is mounted outside near the wheel so 
that we can use it to aid steering, finally gave in to the heavy rain and got 
waterlogged, which spelt the end for the display screen, although it can still 
get a position and we can read it out from the repeater below.<br>
 We arrived 
outside Suva harbour just as dawn broke, and came in to anchor near the Yacht 
Club by 7:30am.<br>
<br>
Suva, the busiest Pacific port so far encountered, 
hardly boasted clear water for swimming, and was jammed full of fishing and 
cargo ships - the only consolation was that the murky water completely killed 
all the travelling weed that had grown on the side of the boat!<br>
<br>
Rob 
embarked on the usual entertainment of checking into the country, this time 
assisted by Cees, and was particularly pleased to award Fiji first place for 
paperwork required, overtaking Panama as the previous winner. There was Customs 
to see, requiring five forms to be filled in (all in triplicate with carbon 
paper of course), requiring full details of crew and the boat, often with the 
same details required on different forms. Quarantine then arrived, requiring 
another form and $30, followed by Health and their form; the quirk being that 
in order to pay for the 'health inspection' a taxi ride was required to a 
building out of town which was two minutes walk from the address given to us so 
that a receipt could be obtained, the number from this receipt was then 
required in a different office on the other side of town. Immigration was then 
visited, in an unmarked portacabin inside a warehouse, requiring all crew 
details yet again, both on separate forms and a joint boat form. Then came the 
enjoyment of obtaining a cruising permit, and a taxi ride to another suburb of 
Suva, where an unlabelled No.17 Richards road was eventually found after asking 
two people and two trips up and down the road, the difficulty being that the 
numbers jumped around with gaps of thirty or more between neighbouring houses. 
Having finally found the correct place, we were told that the office of Fijian 
Affairs had moved to a new office building three weeks previously, so back to 
town to finally get the cruising permit, and another form to be filled in. For 
good measure, on the way back through the Yacht club, we had another form to 
fill in to register, and all this only took 5 hours from 9am until 2pm. The 
various officials were left with a large pile of paper, and we retained just 9 
items for our file!<br>
<br>
Foreseeing the usual complications of five people 
wanting to go ashore at different times and only one dingy to do it in, we 
decided it would be easier to tie up on the outside of the marina so we could 
come and go as we pleased; later on in the afternoon, when the tide was high 
enough to get in, we brought the boat in, just in time to go for a sundowner at 
the yacht club.<br>
<br>
The famous fish and chips had run out, so we headed 
into town for an amazingly cheap curry, canteen style. Fiji has a big Indian 
contingent, about half of the population, which means good cheap curry, 
although Merryn was disappointed by the amount of cockroaches scurrying around 
near the kitchen!<br>
<br>
The next morning, after a quick haircut, it was time 
to explore the town,<br>
<br>
the market,<br>
<br>
and the museum, with their 
displays of traditional Fijian cannibals' human flesh forks!<br>
<br>
The next 
morning Rob and Merryn hired a car (complete with flat tyre and complimentary 
cockroaches) to drive down the coast for a night away, but first we all piled 
in to visit the rainforest just outside Suva for the morning. After some 
discussion of the best route,<br>
<br>
we walked through the forest paths, 
finding waterfalls, pools, a rope swing and picnic tables as we went.<br>
<br>

By the time we got out of the forest, the packed lunch had long been devoured 
and appetites had been enhanced by all the activities, so Jay, Jack and Cees 
went off to a nearby lodge for a relaxed lunch and return to Suva by bus,<br>

<br>and Rob and Merryn carried on down the coast, eventually finding a secluded 
resort and their own small<i>bure</i> (Fijian style thatched dwelling) for the 
night.<br>
<br>
After a hurried drive back from the south coast the next 
morning, passing more roadside houses hidden in the lush Fijian vegetation 
growing on the wet East side of the island,<br>
<br>
Rob and Merryn got back to 
the boat to find the tide falling faster than expected, and everyone else still 
out in town shopping, so took the boat back out to anchor in the bay before the 
depth wasn't enough to actually get out of the marina. There then followed 
another hour of paperwork to check out of Suva, one of the forms being exactly 
the same as the form required on the way in, then we were off again, headed to 
the Mamanuca islands off the south west corner of Viti Levu, via two overnight 
stops, one of which was a lovely sandy bay.<br>
<br>
Arriving at the Mamanucca 
group of islands, and passing through Wilkes passage in the outlying reef, we 
headed straight for Musket Cove, a resort that welcomes yachties and where 
people gather before heading down to New Zealand or Australia.<br>
<br>

Anchored off the resort gave us plenty of opportunity to enjoy the bars and 
restaurant, and the snorkelling off a small sand cay just outside the 
anchorage. Merryn hunted out the lilo that Polly kindly left behind and did her 
own version of snorkelling, relaxed style.<br>
<br>
After a few days we went 
for a cruise to nearby Castaway Island, picking a path through the reefs and 
coral areas, with Jack and Cees posted at the bow checking we weren't about to 
plough into something.<br>
<br>
After a stop for lunch, a good snorkel and a 
walk on the shore at the behind Castaway Island &#133;<br>
<br>
&#133; we 
returned to Musket Cove, leaving again a few days later to go to a dive spot 
near Musket Cove in the morning, which was a couple of large pinnacles off the 
end of the reef, and loads of fish, including one very large fat puffer fish.
<br><br>
After motoring most of the day, in very light winds, we arrived at 
Bounty Island just as the light was starting to fade, and managed to catch a 
lovely big fish for supper just before we anchored - it was a 'narrow barred 
Spanish mackerel' and is one of the few fish with the four star rating in our 
fish book.<br>
<br>
We felt it right that the fish needed a barbeque to do it 
justice, and during the lighting process Rob came up with the best tool so far 
for getting the blaze going - his diving flipper (try it!)<br>
<br>
After an 
early night due to stuffing ourselves so full of delicious fish we 
couldn&#146;t move, we all got in the water and snorkelled over the nearby 
reef, which had good coral pinnacles in the deep water near the boat. Merryn 
and Rob walked around the island in less than an hour - beach all the way!<br>

<br>We then headed off to Vuda Point Marina after lunch, our land base for a 
few days whilst exploring the west coast, and fitted snugly into a gap between 
two other boats in the hurricane hole harbour.<br>
<br>
As patrons of the 
marina we found ourselves to be guests of the adjioining resort with use of 
their swimming pool, a bonus which competed against the heat, no wind, 
mosquitos all night and being unable to jump over the side into the sea to cool 
off!<br>
 First town to visit was Nadi (pronounced Na<b>n</b>di), a fairly 
touristy town with lots of clothing shops and a large temple at one end.<br>

<br>We had made our way through the supplies of beer and spirits from 
Rarotonga, so Merryn and Rob returned home from Nadi duty free shops with a few 
cases of beer, and Jack brought home a bottle of whisky; unfortunately the 
latter was emptied, very much to the detriment of all the next morning, 
especially Rob!<br>
<br>
Lautoka the next day was a much more industrial town, 
with the smell and smoke of sugar cane factories filling the air, and lots of 
narrow guage railways with sugar cane trains and lorries piled high with sugar 
cane taking the crop to the factories.<br>
<br>
Rob had to go through the 
entire checking in and out procedure for immigration and customs again which is 
never a nice prospect with a hangover, while Jay and Jack went to the local 
market for provisions, and then went to the &quot;Garden of the Sleeping 
Giant&quot; with Cees on the way home, a mountain garden filled with orchids.
<br><br>
Meanwhile Merryn and Rob spent the rest of the day attempting to find 
an internet caf&eacute; that was good enough for the website update, and then 
went to the supermarket for a big shop of stores needed for the journey to New 
Zealand.<br>
<br>
The next day, our last day on the mainland, Jay had arranged 
a pick-up truck to take us to see a village in the hills where we could see 
native Fijian life, and go for a hike in the hills.<br>
<br>
After an hour of 
bum-numbing transport over tracks in the hills we finally arrived at the 
village and went on a three hour hike over the hills, taking in the obligatory 
waterfall and good views all the way to the sea, followed by a cooling swim in 
the river.<br>
<br>
Back at the village we were going to say hello to the chief 
but unfortunately this was the wrong time so we couldn&#146;t. Fijian culture 
has a lot of tradition about arriving at a village, where you mustn't enter 
until you are met, and then you take the chief a gift of<i> Kava</i>, the root 
of a pepper plant, which is ground and mixed into a mildly anasthetic drink and 
is drunk as part of a ceremony. Unfortunately the kava drink is muddy and vile 
tasting, and from the first time we tried it in Tonga were not too interested 
in drinking it again (except Jack, who had it several times in the interim and 
was nominated the kava expert).<br>
 Almost relieved to be saved from having to 
drink Kava when our lift arrived, we left the collection of huts with woven 
Pandanus sides and went back to the boat.<br>
<br>
Burning out of the marina at 
full blast we headed towards Beachcomber island, apparently notorious for 
having an active nightlife, hoping to arrive and anchor before dark. 
Unfortunately the light faded quickly and after a close encounter with the reef 
surrounding the island we turned back to the previous island (Treasure Island) 
which had an easier approach and was more sheltered.<br>
<br>
Despite the 
different venue we had a good time that evening at the resort bar on Treasure 
Island dancing to the band, and after a lunchtime stop for Rob and Cees to go 
diving looking for a wreck of a plane on the sea floor the next day (which they 
didn&#146;t find) we returned once again to Musket Cove for our final night in 
Fiji.<br>
 We left early the next afternoon for Opua, New Zealand, a trip of 
about 1100 miles, and the final passage of the journey.<br>
<br>
By lunchtime 
on Monday 17th October we were ready for the off, having completed all last 
minute tasks on shore such as buying fresh veg and bread, and having one last 
stationary shower. This time we also made sure that all items on deck were well 
tied down, and got out the storm staysail and refreshed our memory of how it 
fitted - the passage to New Zealand has a certain reputation, especially for a 
gale from the South West, so it was not a remote possibility that we would need 
to heave to in heavy weather at some point on the journey.<br>
 Having said our 
farewells we headed out of Musket Cove for the last time, and having navigated 
out of Wilkes Passage in the surrounding reef, we put up all we had and sailed 
close hauled to the southerly wind.<br>
<br>
We were headed for a vague point 
about 750 miles away north of the Northern tip of New Zealand, with the 
intention of then making a dog-leg back to the south east, apparently the best 
way taking into account the normal weather conditions.<br>
<br>
The fair wind 
stayed with us, even coming round more to the east so that we could steer our 
south westerly course until early in the morning of the third day, when it 
became light and variable, and we carried on under engine power. The only 
interruptions were a rip that appeared overnight in the staysail, which we took 
off and Jay sewed up, and a surprising double catch of Tuna on both of our 
fishing lines at the same time just after dawn one morning.<br>
<br>
After 
motoring the whole day and night, the wind returned on the other tack and we 
sailed well again for another 24 hours, zooming past the Tropic of Capricorn at 
six knots - goodbye to the sunny warm tropics!<br>
<br>
It was also time to say 
goodbye to something else - our faithful Aloe Vera plant, who had accompanied 
us all the way from England and despite many upsets and long periods of neglect 
without water, and dousings of salt water, was still alive and rendering 
assistance to sunburt skin. New Zealand has lots of quarrantine rules, one of 
which is no living plants allowed - so after trimming all the succulent leaves 
off to make a hideously healthy drink which tasted so bad it took her four days 
to drink, Merryn threw the poor plant overboard.<br>
<br>
Going down to storm 
jib and double reefed main at one point with force 6 winds overnight, we were 
nevertheless disappointed when the wind left us and ended up being a light 
breeze out of the south. We were all missing the tropics that we had been 
spoiled with for over a year - the sea temp had gone down from the usual 26 
degrees C to a chilly 19 degrees in just four days, and the southerly wind was 
not a warm one, everyone wrapping up well and trying to keep warm on the wheel.
<br><br>
Some of us, however, took the cold thing a bit far and were not 
spotted for days wearing less than a full kit of three fleeces, gloves, wet 
weather trousers, etc. There were even mutterings about lighting the diesel 
stove in the saloon, which hadn't been used since Northern Spain !<br>
<br>
Two 
days of motoring directly into the light wind, and finally something we could 
use, this time from the North East, and we put up all the sails and were making 
a reasonable 5-6 knots when there was suddenly a loud pop and the mainmast 
running backstay popped ! (This basically holds most of the force put on the 
main mast by the jib and mainsail, ie. pretty vital in stopping the mast 
snapping). We immediately luffed up into the wind and dropped the jib and 
mainsail, then hove to while Rob climbed up the mast and replaced it, getting a 
good beating from swinging around against the mast in the process.<br>
<br>

Backstay mended, we carried on merrily as before, with the fair wind staying 
with us until early the next morning, when it again disappeared as we spent the 
day in squalls of rain and variable winds.<br>
<br>
Late afternoon, and the 
wind swung around to South East, where it stayed for the remaining 3 days of 
our journey, and we sailed close hauled into the wind and sea, most of the time 
with the engine helping a little, sometimes with quite big waves coming at us. 
We cursed (as usual) the weather forecast which had turned out wrong; we would 
have been much better off if we had gone directly for New Zealand from Fiji, 
rather than heading out to the west as advised.<br>
 The bumpy sea took its 
toll on Cees, and he found the best place for him was outside on the coach 
house roof, despite the frequent spray over the side from the waves.<br>
<br>

Jack was having no problems coping with the bumpy sea, and even made some 
delicious apricot muffins one afternoon.<br>
<br>
The only other event was the 
catching of a fat tuna just as darkness fell the night before we arrived, 
something that would have been slightly more welcome a few days earlier!<br>

<br>As morning arrived, we sighted land from underneath lots of dark rain 
clouds which we travelled through, getting a thorough soaking, much the same as 
the previous several days of squally and rainy weather.<br>
<br>
Turning 
slightly so that the wind was on the beam, we had an excellent sail into and 
across the Bay of Islands, a fitting end to Cees and Jack's voyage on Lista 
Light.<br>
<br>
Arriving at Opua at around 5pm, we caught the customs and 
quarrantine before they went home, and so after being checked into New Zealand 
and getting our passports stamped, and having all remaining vegetable and dairy 
products, plus any dried beans that had any remote possibility of sprouting 
(even including some popcorn!) taken away to be destroyed, we set about 
clebrating our arrival at the Opua Yacht Club.<br>
 The next morning, some 
people looked a bit pale &#133;<br>
<br>
and rumour has it that they may have 
over-celebrated their arrival.<br>
 A few days of hanging around and exploring 
the local towns and enjoying the odd cliff walk, and it was mass exodus - Jack 
and Cees left for good, headed to Whangarei and Auckland in Cees's hire car; 
Merryn and Rob caught the bus the next day to Auckland to hunt for a camper van 
to continue their travels.<br>
 They all found Auckland's centre to be 
surprisingly small, everyone independently managing to find backpacker 
accomodation within a two minute walk of each other - this of course led to us 
all meeting up at a local bar for Halloween.<br>
<br>
Merryn and Rob returned 
empty-handed a few days later after walking along endless streets in search of 
garages and camper vans, but having climbed the Sky Tower and seen a few other 
Auckland sights.<br>
<br>
All was not lost though, since they had seen a camper 
van in a local town before going to Auckland, which they now realised looked 
like a better bet - the next day saw a deal struck, and wheels acquired.<br>

<br>After only a few short days of van ownership, Rob and Merryn had to leave 
their new pride and joy Dory behind (we were told that was the van's name by 
the previous owners) while the three remaining crew (Jay, Merryn, Rob) took the 
boat down to Whangarei, a larger and more accessible town, with a travel lift 
large enough to accommodate Lista Light's beamy size and 35-ton weight.<br>
 
Not quite managing to sail close hauled out of the bay, we skirted the famous 
'hole in the rock' rock at the head of the bay &#133;<br>
<br>
&#133;then 
carried on down to Whangamumu, a deep sheltered bay, for the night, where Rob 
and Merryn climbed a hill, only to find it very hard going with a strange 
springy grass carpet up to their knees to tradge through - the view was worth 
it though!<br>
<br>
Another day's sailing the next day, this time anything 
between 3 and 7 knots into a gusty and variable wind, as we made our way down 
the coast, stopping overnight at Tutukaka harbour and then off again the next 
morning for Whangarei river, this time motoring straight into the wind - there 
was much more interest in a soduku puzzle rather than steering!<br>
<br>
Rather 
than try to get up the river against the tide that afternoon, we decided to 
anchor at the bottom of the river in a bay for the night, and go up the 20 mile 
river the next morning with a fair tide - saving the small amount of diesel 
that we had, and having less chance of running aground in the narrow channel at 
the top of the river.<br>
<br>
Once safely up the river with the tide the next 
day, we tied up alongside a pontoon in preparation for being lifted out of the 
water the next morning.<br>
<br>
Then, it was up,<br>
<br>
up,<br>
<br>
and away
<br><br>
A bit of a clean on the bottom<br>
<br>
then she was propped up and 
left to be re-painted.<br>
 We were amazed at the good condition of the bottom 
of the boat - especially after eleven months at sea, nearly all the seams 
between the planks were still good and there was still a good layer of paint 
over most of the bottom. The success of the epoxy holding all the seams 
together, that we had done in Antigua, was immediately obvious.<br>
 Jay got to 
work sanding and re-painting the topsides whilst Rob and Merryn prepared the 
van for their voyage off around New Zealand and re-painted the bottom of the 
boat with anti-fouling paint.<br>
<br>
Merryn and Rob returned after a test run 
cruising around the North coast, in time to fit a new bottom rudder hinge to 
replace the rather worn out 1935 item,<br>
<br>
and help complete the other 
important tasks, such as touching up the name boards.<br>
<br>
All painting on 
the sides finished (including the bullwarks) in two weeks, and then it was back 
into the water and around up into Whangarei town basin to sit for a few months 
while we all do our separate things.<br>
<br>
And so, Lista Light sits awaiting 
an uncertain fate, regrettably for sale after 20 years of ownership; here too 
ends the commentary of our trip, and the updates to the Lista Light website. I 
hope that you have all enjoyed living our voyage with us, it has certainly been 
a memorable year and a half that we will enjoy looking back on.<br>
<br>
<br>
 
PS. Anyone interested in buying Lista Light, please contact Jay -<br>
via Tel. 
00447803 598122 or email jay@listalight.co.uk<br>
<br>
It was decided that 
Lista Light would make the long voyage back home. Jay flew back out to New 
Zealand on the 17th of March where Noel had already hauled the boat out of the 
water. Then the work started in earnest, which included getting the mast out 
and fitting the new hydraulic steering. The main mast was still in good 
condition, but the top mast, which had been suspected of having some rot for 
some time, needed to be replaced.<br>
<br>
After conferring with Rob, Noel 
decided that it would be wise to fashion a new spectacle fitting for the top 
mast.<br>
<br>
Jack, who was part of the crew on the Pacific crossing, was 
still travelling around New Zealand and travelled up from Wellington to join 
the boat and become a crew man again. His first assignment was to purchase a 
new fishing rod, as the last one lost a fight with a big dorado. R.I.P. 
faithful crewman. He returned triumphantly a few hours later with the latest 
addition to the crew.<br>
<br>
As the mast was down Jay decided to attack the 
finials which were definitely not looking their original colour. But several 
hours hard graft later had them returned to their former glory.<br>
<br>
After 
a hard days work there is nothing better than a good dinner - which Noel 
decided to follow up with his favourite dessert, Tallow.<br>
<br>
During this 
time Noel was still actively searching for crew. An engineer called Martin got 
in contact with the boat and was signed on as crew. There was also a guy called 
Nils who was working aboard a boat that was close by who was eager to get back 
to Europe. He came over for a chat and was also signed on as crew.<br>
<br>

There was a number of unforeseen delays with the fitting of the auto-pilot, 
much to Noel and Jay's frustration - however there was plenty of maintenance 
work that kept everyone busy from dawn till dusk, which included antifouling, 
some painting, and the painstaking job of trying to service the old blocks 
which averaged four hours per piece.<br>
<br>
Finally Lista Light was returned 
to water and the mast was put back in with a crane. The return went very well 
and it was evident from the smile on the skippers face that he was relieved to 
be back in the water.<br>
<br>
After Lista Light was deposited back in the 
water we returned to the town basin where we were put onto the pilings and a 
few days later we were allowed to come alongside the dock.<br>
<br>
The date 
for us to leave Whangarei was almost upon us and the last preparations were 
under way. The bulk provisioning took six trolleys to transport it to the boat 
and it took five people the better part of three hours to stow it all away. 
Then there was the fresh vegetables that were purchased from the farmers market 
at the crack of dawn one morning. We left the dock the morning before our 
departure to give our new auto-pilot a test and to reconfigure its compass 
which involved doing four or five turns and a general run around. The system 
performed well, but the real test will be when we hit the open sea. The actual 
hydraulic ram is mounted on the stern of the boat underneath the helmsman's 
seat, where the ram extends through the wood to where the end is mounted around 
a ball socket which in turn is mounted on the rudder post. The hydraulic pump 
is situated below deck just above the chart table in the engine room where we 
hope it will be slightly more protected.<br>
<br>
The night before our 
departure we thought that in proper sailing tradition we would have a few 
friends around for a drink or two. Mark and Quentin from the yacht Skaardu 
arrived armed with a bottle of champagne along with strict instructions that it 
was not to be opened until we reached the Mediterranean. Also the party animal 
Alan came over, who turned out to be a very bad influence on Jay who ended up 
staying up till past 2:00am exchanging stories and drinking red wine. An almost 
unheard of occurrence.<br>
<br>
Despite being up late the previous evening we 
left Whangarei on the morning tide and started our run to Tutakaka a sheltered 
bay further up the coast. The crew list stood at six people - going from left 
to right on the picture below we have Martin, Nils, Julian, Noel and Jay.<br>

<br>and Jack..<br>
<br>
We had quite a bumpy ride on the way up to Tutakaka 
with a couple of the crew men suffering from sea sickness. But everyone felt 
much better when we got into the sheltered anchorage and even plucked up the 
courage to indulge in a couple of cold beers.<br>
<br>
The next morning we 
headed for Opua, the Bay of Islands where we would clear out and our first blue 
water passage of the trip will begin. There wasn't quite enough wind for a sail 
up there so we helped out the motor with a single reefed main and the staysail. 
We went past the legendary hole in the rock and began our run through the 
beautiful Bay of Islands.<br>
<br>
On arrival to Opua we were put onto a wharf 
that we shared with another old boat R.Tucker Thompson. Needless to say when we 
got there the beer lantern was lit and everyone relaxed. A crew member from R. 
Tucker Thompson came over for a look around and was encouraged to stay for a 
beverage. We were also joined by an American friend of Noel's, Joby, who is 
currently a crew man aboard a nearby boat and after a little encouragement they 
were persuaded to stay for dinner as well.<br>
<br>
Noel seemed particularly 
pleased with his crew and couldn't help showing his affection over dinner that 
evening.<br>
<br>
We had one day spare before we left just to get in some fresh 
food, and enjoy the local facilities that we would sorely miss when we were on 
passage. Every one did their own thing either heading for the local town or 
ringing friends and family. We cleared out the next morning and headed for the 
open sea. Everyone took the opportunity to get used to helming the boat in 
preparation for harder times.<br>
<br>
After motoring for the first day and a 
bit we were all very pleased when the wind picked up enough to carry the number 
one jib, staysail, full main and one reef in the mizzen. We rounded that day 
off beautifully with our first fish of the passage, which was a small dorado.
<br><br>
There was a minor panic when a plank of wood was noticed, still half 
attached to the boat, banging against the rudder and the prop. Noel quickly 
realized that it was part of the sacrificial keel and climbed down onto the 
quadrant to pull it off and cast it adrift.<br>
<br>
The hydraulic steering was 
also playing up with air bubbles in the line. So when the sea had settled down 
a bit more we whipped off the wheel and bleed the line whilst steering with the 
emergency tiller.<br>
<br>
The wind has been constantly changing on us all the 
way so far until it went light and came straight from behind us. After trying 
the main and the medium jib for a while we changed to the mizzen and the same 
jib just to have it flogging all the time as well. Not wishing to give up Noel 
bought out his new toy, a spinnaker. Having anticipated these kind of 
conditions at some point in the trip Noel went on the hunt for a spinnaker 
before we left New Zealand. As luck would have it a yacht in the town basin was 
selling one the right size. After a bit of trial and error we decided that it 
was best to haul it up on the jib halyard in preference to the topsail halyard.
<br><br>
It went very well for the couple of hours that we flew it before it 
got dark and we had to call the fun to an end and motor into the night instead. 
The top speed that we reached with the spinnaker was five and a half knots but 
the wind would lull from time to time and we could drop to as little three 
knots.<br>
<br>
Early morning on the seventh day we caught first sight of the 
lights of New Caledonia, and by first light we caught our first sight of New 
Caledonia.<br>
<br>
After defining the leading lights for the Boulari pass we 
effortlessly motored through and anchored off the island Amedee for a snorkel. 
It turned out to be a beautiful snorkel with lots of things to see. Everyone 
got the chance to relax and cool off for a couple of hours before we tackled 
the fourteen mile leg to Noumea.<br>
<br>
As we reluctantly weighed anchor and 
left for Noumea we had a fish hit our lure. Noel was first to the rod and after 
a spirited fight we landed a small Wahoo.<br>
<br>
Fourteen miles of flat calm 
motoring towards Noumea later and we were tied up alongside the dock awaiting 
the final clearance to go and explore the town.<br>
<br>
After doing all the 
formalities we were free to explore the town. But the general preference of the 
crew veered more to testing the shower facilities and a good dinner which 
warranted the barbeque coming out for the landfall dinner. Sometime after 
dinner Nils, Noel, Julian and Martin decided to check out the local watering 
holes. Forgetting that New Caledonian time is an hour behind New Zealand's' 
they only managed one beer before the bar closed and they had to return to the 
boat where Jack and Jay had already retired to their beds. The next morning was 
a mass washing day with Jay in charge of the washing machine. Whilst this was 
going on Noel, Nils, Julian and Martin headed for town in search of the 
hardware that we realized we needed after leaving New Zealand, and Jack headed 
for the local internet caf&eacute;. That evening we headed for the town square 
where a local band was meant to be playing, stopping at a bar en-route where we 
had received a free drinks card.<br>
<br>
We arrived a little late at the 
square but still got enjoy a few reggae songs. There was also a number of 
stalls there selling food, plants and local wares in general. As we had no hard 
liquor on board Martin and Julian decided to test the local rum by purchasing a 
bottle each. Back at the boat we decided to sample the first bottle by mixing 
it with some sliced fresh lime and a little brown sugar.<br>
<br>
As the first 
bottle went down so well we decided just to try the second one, despite people 
getting rosier in the check and the conversation getting more animated.<br>
<br>
After polishing off half the second bottle as well we decided that it would be 
wise to turn in for the evening as we had a lot to do the next morning.<br>
<br>
Despite some people feeling slightly the worse for wear the next morning we all 
trooped off to the local market where we would provision for the next leg of 
the voyage.<br>
<br>
After about an hour we had bought everything that we 
thought we would need and carried it back to the boat with the help of the 
washing basket.<br>
<br>
As Noel had already cleared us out earlier that 
morning we all had a couple of hours to wander the town and do some last minute 
interneting. Come midday we headed for the fuel dock where we replenished our 
diesel supply and headed out to anchor at the island of Ilot Ti Non for the 
night.<br>
<br>
Noel decided to take the opportunity to put a sycaflex and sand 
mixture, that was recommended by some locals, on the hole that the sacrificial 
keel left to ensure it was protected from the elements. Despite both Martin and 
Noel donning their diving gear and trying to forcefully keep it there it was to 
no avail and it just broke up and floated away<br>
<br>
Whilst Noel and Martin 
were under the boat Julian and Nils headed off to the nearby reef where Julian 
had his first shark encounter.<br>
<br>
The next morning we weighed anchor and 
headed for the pass. Once we cleared the pass we came onto our course for 
Torres Strait. We started off with a moderate amount of wind up to about ten 
knots, so we put up the number one jib, staysail, single reefed main and a 
single reefed mizzen, the sails were not generating enough power to be left on 
their own so the motor was just ticking over to keep everything full and happy. 
By nightfall we had lost the wind altogether, so down came the sails and it was 
all up to the motor. By the next morning we had a little bit of wind from 
behind us which was just enough to waft the diesel fumes over the boat. Most 
unpleasant. Since we left the days have just been getting hotter and hotter so 
we decided that a swim was in order for the day. So after throwing a rope out 
the back we took it in turns to jump in and act as shark bait.<br>
<br>
After 
everyone had cooled off a bit we decided that we should try the secret weapon. 
So the spinnaker came out to give us an average of three knots. As the wind 
picked up a bit more we reached the six knot mark with some careful fine tuning 
on the tack and sheet.<br>
<br>
The sea state so far has been beautifully calm 
so everyone took the opportunity to get up to date with the general chores. 
Nils and Julian have been working on some ratlines for the main mast, the plan 
is for them to reach the spreaders and while the sea state was calm they got 
well on their way up the shrouds.<br>
<br>
Later that day when we were still 
flying our spinnaker we had two humpback whales swim alongside us much to the 
excitement of everyone on board. They stayed with us for about ten minutes 
before swimming off (you can just make out its dorsal fin in the middle of the 
picture).<br>
<br>
So far we have done extremely well on the fishing front 
catching four tuna in five days. Surprisingly they were all Albacore tuna, 
which we marinated in either soy sauce with garlic or chilli. The first and 
biggest Albacore was caught by Nils on the morning watch which was also the 
first fish he caught whilst being on board.<br>
<br>
After flying the spinnaker 
on a number of occasions we thought that ''Sails'' (Jay) would need to have a 
look at tightening up the bluff a bit stop it flapping virtually all the time, 
so the old and faithful sewing machine came out and, after a bit of a service, 
the modification was under way.<br>
<br>
Annoyingly just as we were about to 
host the spinnaker again after its birthday Noel discovered that where it had 
been patched previously it had broken again, so it was back to ''Sails'' for a 
repair job. Unfortunately this time the sewing machine had conked out and it 
had to be repaired by hand.<br>
<br>
Whilst the sea state was still very calm 
Jay started to teach people how to navigate with a sextant. This involves at 
least an hours hard work of taking two sights with the sextant then looking up 
the relevant numbers in a nautical almanac and either adding or subtracting it 
to your sight.<br>
<br>
There was a big disturbance one morning when someone 
spotted a stranger on the foredeck, but the panic was over when we recognized 
it to be Julian who had just had a shave.<br>
<br>
So far we have snaked around 
the rum line trying to keep the wind in a more workable direction, at one stage 
we were seventy two miles off of our course. Quite often the wind would just 
drop off to nothing and the Perkins would have to be used. We hit one bad 
squall one evening and as luck would have it we had everything up with a single 
reef in the mizzen. The off watch people were dozing in the saloon waiting for 
the wind to dye so we could reef, while Lista was roaring along at speeds of up 
to ten knots. As soon as the wind slackened a bit, we charged onto the deck and 
replaced the big jib for the medium one and put a reef in the main. Twenty 
minutes later it was still raining but the wind had died off and we were 
slopping around in the aftermath. We have started baking bread on a regular 
basis now, we get through approximately two loaves a day, and if someone is 
feeling motivated enough, there are fresh cakes for afternoon tea as well.<br>

<br>As we were nearing our first way point the wind died on us and we were 
motoring along and somehow losing up to two knots. As there had been no reports 
of currents anywhere near this strong Noel jumped in the water to check that we 
were not dragging something. The rest of the crew grabbed the opportunity of a 
cool down session and promptly followed him over the side. It turned out that 
we were not dragging anything, so we just have to put up with our low speed. 
After threatening for several weeks Noel decided that it was haircut time and 
Jay very kindly offered to do the honours. Half an hour later and our captain 
was looking very presentable.<br>
<br>
We have arrived at the beginning of 
Torres Strait after three days of motoring and just as we started our run the 
wind picked to a useable strength. So with everything up and making between six 
and seven knots we entered the Strait with the morning light. Our spirits were 
slightly dampened however when it started raining in earnest and didn't let up 
until late that evening, but the arrival of Neptune's messengers (some 
dolphins) was a welcome distraction from the downpour<br>
<br>
By mid afternoon 
the next day we entered the Prince of Whales channel which was the narrowest 
part of the Strait and was the last major part of the Strait as well. So it was 
not without a slightly regretful air that we put our back to land and started 
on our course for Darwin.<br>
<br>
We were still sailing beautifully the next 
day with a full main, single reefed mizzen, staysail and the number one jib. We 
hit a bad squall later that night with rain slashing down and we were hitting 
speeds of up to ten knots. With the deck bouncing around beneath our feet we 
changed to the medium jib, staysail, single reefed main, and double reefed 
mizzen. With our sail area better suited to the wind speed we trucked on 
towards our destination. A couple of days later we had our fishing lines out 
when we had a screaming take on the rod. After nearly an hours battle with this 
monster from the deep we got it along side to see a beautiful sailfish on the 
end. There was a great deal of excitement as we strained to get it on board. It 
was two point three metres in length and we estimated its weight to be in 
excess of sixty pounds.<br>
<br>
The next morning we made our turn into the 
beginning of the Clarence Strait, with a three reefed main, a double reefed 
mizzen, the medium jib and staysail up we sailed close hauled up the Strait. We 
were making about five knots from the sails, but we also had the tide with us 
so we were shooting along at speeds of between ten and eleven knots. As luck 
would have it our run up the Strait coincided nicely with the tide and this 
made it possible for us to reach the anchorage in Fannie Bay that same evening. 
After we had successfully dropped the anchor we all relaxed with a cold beer. 
The next morning we moved onto the dock so that immigration and customs could 
clear us in. We had to stay on the dock for that day and night but the next day 
we went through a lock and into the marina.<br>
<br>
We unfortunately had to 
say goodbye to Nils here as he chose to leave the boat, so now we are back on 
the lookout for crew.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
As usual when we get to land there is 
mad rush for a long hot shower which is normally followed by an ice cream, the 
combination of which led to everyone looking and feeling far more human. After 
the immediate needs were taken care of most people headed for town which was 
about a twenty minute walk away. Jay headed for the flight centre to confirm 
her flight and Martin and Jack headed off in different directions to get a 
general feel for the town. Julian stayed on the boat to reassemble his bike 
before heading off to town and Noel took the opportunity to catch up on some 
maintenance work.<br>
<br>
It was early evening before the first of the crew 
began to appear and as the sun started to dip below the horizon a beer call was 
heard and there was no objections from anyone. After dinner Jack produced a 
bottle of whisky much to the delight of everyone, and the toast was to Lista 
for the safe voyage.<br>
<br>
The next day we headed for the supermarket to get 
the majority of the provisioning done before Jay left. Three and a half hours 
later we returned to the boat to start stowing the provisions.<br>
<br>
There 
was of course a bit of maintenance to catch up with whilst we were in the 
marina. This included Julian being hoisted up the mast to give the shrouds a 
coat of Stockholm tar and Jack giving the main mast gaff a birthday in the way 
of a sanding and several coats of French polish.<br>
<br>
Before we started off 
on the long run across the Indian ocean Noel and Martin decided to give the 
gear box a quick check over and make sure that it was aligned properly.<br>
<br>
As Jay and Julian are leaving the boat here in Darwin there will only be three 
of us left. So we decided to post some adverts for crew around the local 
backpackers and in the marina. A couple of days later a young man called Gareth 
popped by the boat enquiring about the vacancy. After a bit of a chat with Noel 
he decided to take on a crew position and will be moving onto the boat the next 
day. We had also just got in contact with Amiria whom we had met in Opua and 
had just sailed to Fiji, and she agreed to fly out here and join us. There was 
still considerable interest in the positions and there was a regular stream of 
people enquiring about the vacancies. We however decided that five was an 
optimum number and had to turn the others away.<br>
<br>
In order to get to 
know Gareth better we decided to all go and have a drink with him that same 
evening. So after a quick one for the road aboard ship we headed off to meet 
Gareth and Noel who were already in town.<br>
<br>
As can so often happen with 
good company one round lead to another and one bar lead to another until it was 
the early hours and we were all slightly the worse for wear. It was a very slow 
start the next morning with more than one person nursing a heavy head. Still as 
work is supposed to be the best cure for a hangover we all put our shoulders to 
the grindstone and by mid morning the hangover was a distant memory. Martin had 
been thinking of investing in a guitar for several days now and much to 
everyone's surprise he returned to the boat one afternoon with a big smile on 
his face and a new guitar under his arm.<br>
<br>
The day for us to leave 
Darwin was set for Sunday. As the diesel station, which was just outside the 
marina lock, did not operate on the weekend we went through the lock on the 
Friday to fill up with diesel and then went back into the marina till Sunday.
<br><br>
Amiria, who had flown into Darwin in the early hours of Friday morning 
accompanied Noel and Jack to the first of two markets on Saturday morning. We 
bought a large majority of the basic items with the intention of picking up the 
rest from the Sunday market before we leave. Having finished the beer that we 
had bought in New Zealand we also did a booze run later that day, purchasing 
our mandatory ten cases of beer and a few litres of wine that filled the booze 
locker near to bursting.<br>
<br>
The next day Jack, Amiria, and Gareth headed 
for the market to pick the last of the fruit and vegetables while Noel and 
Martin finished of the last of the maintenance before we put to sea. At ten 
o'clock sharp we headed for the lock and the open ocean.<br>
<br>
Once we were 
out through the lock it was just a case of running the bowsprit back out and 
tightening up the relevant stays. Then we worked our way around the many shoals 
that lay around Darwin and started on our course for Christmas Island.<br>
<br>

Amiria and Gareth started off getting to know Lista Light by taking a trick at 
the helm where they could get a general feel for the boat and also be able to 
see the ropes and sails in active service. We started the first night off with 
a single reefed mizzen and a poled out staysail. Amiria and Jack who were first 
on watch had a close shave with a fishing boat who ignored our running lights 
and repeated calls on the VHF, and had to turn sharply to avoid him as he 
passed on the wrong side of us. The next morning we had a double reefed main up 
with the storm jib to balance us out a bit more.<br>
<br>
Martin was now 
playing his guitar on a regular basis and was even heard to be muttering things 
about starting his own band aboard ship. Everyone admitted that he was 
improving dramatically by the day and it wouldn't be long before he would be 
called upon to entertain the crew on a regular basis. That same morning we had 
the rod scream off with a beautiful yellow fin tuna on the end, much to the 
delight of everyone.<br>
<br>
The third day out we had a man over board drill. 
It took us three turns around the fender before we picked it up, despite Jack 
launching himself over the side with a rope attached to him and attempting to 
swim to it. He unfortunately ran out of rope before he reached it and had to 
drag himself back aboard the boat. After we retrieved the fender we came back 
on our course and had a beautiful sail for the remainder of the day with 
everything up bar a reef in the mizzen and the staysail. By the next day the 
wind started turning on us and we and to turn with it in order keep the sails 
full. We dropped the sails in the early hours of the morning and turned the 
engine on, as soon as it was light we hoisted the spinnaker and had a good days 
run.<br>
<br>
We took the spinnaker down just before last light and motored on 
into the night with twin headsails and the engine ticking over. The next 
morning we had enough wind to raise the mizzen and the spinnaker. It had been 
very quiet on the fish front since we caught that tuna but the lull was broken 
when we had a take on the rod which resulted in a good sized Wahoo being landed.
<br><br>
The conditions stayed pretty much the same for the next couple of days 
with everyone keeping themselves busy with boat chores or little projects that 
they have taken upon themselves. Gareth started sanding and varnishing the 
heads hatch. Amiria started working on some protective leather sheaves for the 
topmast shroud, Jack restarted the work on the ratlines and Noel and Martin 
were on block maintenance duty. Noel and Martin were still doing their sextant 
homework on a regular basis and getting better by the day.<br>
<br>
A couple of 
days later we were sailing along when a tanker came over the horizon and looked 
set to pass over our bow. After we hailed him on the V.H.F. he gave us a 
weather report and confirmed his intention to pass in front of us. Our fears 
thus allayed we settled back and waited for him to pass in front of us. A 
couple of minutes passed by and he was still on a collision course with us 
until we decided to take things into our own hands and turned sharply to come 
behind him. It was a mad rush to make sure that Jack was lowered down from the 
shrouds and everything was stowed before the boat was violently thrown around 
from his wake. After the danger was past Noel got onto the radio to ask what 
exactly his plan was, his reply to this was, ''just popped over for a closer 
look, have fun at Christmas Island.'' The most annoyed person from the 
encounter was Gareth who had had his tea spilt due to the boat being thrown 
around.<br>
<br>
After a good squirt of adrenalin all around from our near 
miss, we all took a deep breath and settled back into the relaxed daily routine 
that we have all learned love. The wind stayed fairly constant from the North 
East so we flew the spinnaker through the day and twin headsails through the 
night, occasionally we had the mizzen up as well. We were all very happy as the 
wind stayed constant and we chewed through the miles. One morning, however, 
Jack was walking around the deck when he was accosted by what appeared to be a 
pirate, but later turned out to be Gareth who had taken to wearing some 
slightly unusual sun protection.<br>
<br>
The fishing had been a bit slow 
really with only one yellow fin tuna, and one Wahoo so far. Not so good 
compared to the last passage where the only days that we didn't catch something 
were the days that we didn't put the lures out. So everyone was really looking 
forward to the next strike, it wasn't until the second day out of Christmas 
Island that we had a hit on the hand line. Gareth was the first one to it and 
he hauled in a beautiful sailfish to the absolute astonishment of everyone.<br>

<br>Jack and Amiria were still baking on a fairly regular basis with Jack 
baking the always popular banana muffins and Amiria making some absolutely 
beautiful carrot cake.<br>
<br>
Martin was still playing his guitar on a 
regular basis and his hobby seemed to be rubbing off on people as Amiria took 
to playing it on occasion as well.<br>
<br>
Pretty much most of the voyage was 
a down wind sail which meant we went into most nights with twin head sails 
poled out either side and the mizzen as well if it would hold. As we only had 
one roving lizard we would waste a good five minutes every sail change moving 
them around and re-roving the sheets, so Noel took it upon himself to make 
another with the help of Amiria. A little while later and after a good bit of 
swearing, he triumphantly displayed his masterpiece.<br>
<br>
As Murphy's law 
dictates one day out of Christmas Island some grey clouds came over and it 
rained on and off throughout the night. But the sight of land the next morning 
cheered everyone up.<br>
<br>
It was gone midday before we brought the sails 
down and motored into the bay. After Noel had had a quick chat with customs and 
the harbour master we picked up a mooring and everyone breathed a sigh of 
relief. Five minutes hadn't gone by before everyone had launched themselves 
over the side into the crystal clear water.<br>
<br>
After the mandatory post 
arrival swim we all relaxed in the cockpit armed with a cold beer to await the 
customs boys.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately from the provisioning side of things we 
arrived early morning Friday, so as soon as we had sorted out the clearing in 
formalities we hit the town to re-supply. It was an extremely overloaded dinghy 
that ventured fourth from Lista Light in search of propane gas, diesel and 
fresh food.<br>
<br>
We found the locals to be an extremely friendly bunch and 
this was demonstrated when the owner of the diesel pump lent us his truck to do 
ferry runs down to the dock with some jerry cans of diesel. He also very kindly 
allowed us to take our full gas bottle and our shopping back to the dock as 
well.<br>
<br>
After the urgent chores were done everyone got a bit of time to 
explore the Island. Gareth and Martin were very kindly shown around the island 
by a local guy called Ben. Their tour did include climbing down some absolutely 
pristine caves, which they enjoyed so much that they encouraged Amiria, Noel 
and Jack to explore the next morning.<br>
<br>
Noel did manage to drag himself 
away from the constant maintenance that Lista Light requires to take a dive 
among the Coral on a point. Amiria and Jack went with him with their snorkels, 
the snorkelling opportunity being to good a one to miss.<br>
<br>
Noel did take 
the opportunity to chase his roots as his grandfather ran the island, and Jay 
was lucky enough to have spent a good part of her early years growing up here. 
After determining which house his family used to live in, he trekked off up the 
hill to photograph the old house.<br>
<br>
We had an extremely frustrating time 
trying to keep the boat clean as there was always a freighter nearby loading up 
with phosphate, which kept up a constant shower of fine dust that coated 
everything above deck.<br>
<br>
The day of departure has come upon us again and 
it is not without a little reluctance that we leave the friendly Christmas 
Island and carry on with our voyage towards Cocos Keeling. After casting off 
the mooring we motored out of Flying Fish Cove and came onto our course. We had 
stocked up with fresh vegetables before we left, but we had no fresh meat 
aboard so the fishing lines went out with a hopeful air. Unfortunately there 
were an awful lot of birds around and one managed to tangle itself in the line. 
We quickly dragged it aboard and untangled it, releasing it moments later none 
the worse for its encounter. We had almost written off the chances of a catch 
as the afternoon drew on, but just as we were losing the light we had a take on 
the rod. Noel was the first to the rod and hauled in a beautiful Dorado.<br>

<br>We had started the voyage off motor sailing with a single reefed mizzen and 
the number one jib. At first light the next day we hoisted the spinnaker in 
place of the big jib, and once again enjoyed the oh so hard life of downwind 
sailing.<br>
<br>
As the evening drew near we brought down the spinnaker and 
replaced it with the mizzen and a poled out staysail. The next morning as the 
wind hadn't changed much we re-hoisted the spinnaker. About midday, just as we 
were about to serve lunch, we spotted a squall on the horizon and as the wind 
was increasing we prepared to drop the spinnaker. While preparing the halyard 
for the change we misjudged the strength of the sail and halyard went screaming 
out and the spinnaker was dropped in the drink. The motor was quickly cut and 
the spinnaker eased out of the water. Thankfully it only had a very small tear 
in the corner of the sail which ''Sails the Second'' got onto repairing.<br>

<br>After this minor mishap we flew the mizzen, the big jib and the staysail 
poled out the other side. It was very frustrating sailing with the wind 
constantly shifting and changing the sails frequently to compensate for the 
indecisive wind. The third day out of Christmas Island the wind picked to a 
usable strength and Noel made the decision to try and push to get in within our 
four day target. Unfortunately as the wind increased it brought the rain with 
it, and Noel and Amiria getting a torrential downpour all the ay through their 
watch. But as we were sailing at speeds of up to eight knots no one was 
complaining. We even hit eleven point nine knots surfing down a wave.<br>
<br>

We were still doing six knots the next morning with just a three reefed mizzen 
and staysail as Cocos Keeling hoved into view.<br>
<br>
As we motored into the 
atoll Jack was by the chart table keeping an eye on our progress on C-Map, 
Amiria was up the ratlines, and Gareth and Martin had binoculars in the bow 
ensuring that we got safely through the pass.<br>
<br>
With the help of a 
fellow yachtie who was already in the anchorage we negotiated the bommies in a 
very poorly marked channel and dropped anchor. Sitting on the boat with our 
anchor safely in the sand we really could not fault the view which was a 
picturesque beach with palm trees littering the shore line.<br>
<br>
At the 
first opportunity Martin, Jack and Gareth went ashore to check out the island. 
Discovering a shack that was covered with messages from other boats. Among the 
messages was a throne put together out of a tree stump and some drift wood.<br>

<br>We got a very nice surprise the next day when the ferry came to where we 
were anchored and Ben whom we had meet in Christmas Island was on board with 
his fianc&eacute;. As soon as we realized that it was him we popped over to say 
Hi. We bought him and his fianc&eacute;, Mel aboard the boat for a cup of tea, 
and while he was there he told us about this small pass called the rip that was 
on the other side of the Island. Never wanting to be seen to pass up on a good 
opportunity Gareth, Martin and Jack headed back to the Island to take on the 
rip, accompanied by Ben and Mel. The basic idea of the rip is that you start at 
the top of the pass, swim like crazy to keep yourself in the middle of the 
channel and then catch yourself on the rope at the end.<br>
<br>
It was an 
extremely exhausting exercise but it was well worth the effort. After 
snorkelling and relaxing the rest of the day we greeted the sunset with a 
beautiful cocktail of rum and fresh coconut milk freshly gathered from the 
island.<br>
<br>
The next day Noel took his spear gun out and speared five good 
parrot fish that we took ashore and cooked on a fire with bake potatoes and 
kumara.<br>
<br>
We headed for Home Island the next morning in order to fill up 
with petrol and to order some fresh fruit for the morning as we intend to leave 
the next day. After we had visited the shops and had a look around Gareth, 
Martin and Jack headed for West Island on the ferry which was the largest and 
most inhabited island of the group. Once there we meet Ben and Mel again who 
very kindly showed us around the island in their truck.<br>
<br>
We 
unfortunately ran out of time and had to say goodbye to Ben and Mel as we 
headed for the ferry. Tomorrow we are going head back to West Island to pick up 
some last minute supplies and then we intend to leave by mid morning for the 
Chagos Archipelago.<br>
<br>
It was Gareths' birthday on the twentieth of June 
and in order to let the entire lagoon know Noel hoisted the relevant flags to 
say HAPPY BIRTHDAY GARETH. Unfortunately we ran out flags so we had to settle 
for HAPPY BDAY GRY.<br>
<br>
Noel and Martin, after working hard all morning 
headed off towards the outer reef for a dive later that day. Jack and Gareth 
accompanied them to provide support and to do a bit of snorkelling at the same 
time. It was a very pleasant day for it with plenty of different fish. 
Unfortunately towards the end of the dive two large grey reef sharks started 
circling the four of us, so we decided to call it a day and head back to the 
boat.<br>
<br>
It was later that day when we decided to leave our mark on Cocos 
Keeling by drawing up a Lista Light pennant. Gareth and Amiria were the main 
brains behind the operation, doing half each, but everyone else was only to 
happy to give plenty of helpful advice on the project. Later that day the 
master piece was finished and we all trooped ashore to help display it. After a 
few acrobatics we had it securely fastened to the roof of the shack, and we all 
proudly posed under it.<br>
<br>
After a beautiful birthday dinner of pumpkin 
soup and Yorkshire puddings a la Martin, Amiria surprised Gareth by bringing 
out the birthday cake that she had been secretly baking throughout the day. 
After a resounding chorus of happy birthday he blew out the candles and cut his 
cake.<br>
<br>
Early the next morning we raised the anchor and motored out 
through the passage and started on our fifteen hundred mile course for Chagos. 
Once we cleared the atoll we hoisted a single reefed mizzen and the spinnaker 
to give us a speed of between five and six knots. The spinnaker has done us 
proud so far and saved us many a litre of diesel in the process, so due to his 
tough nature and hardiness, even surviving being dropped in the drink on two 
occasions, we officially recognized him as a proven member of the Lista Light 
crew and christened him Brutus. As the evening drew in we hauled Brutus down 
and replaced him with a single reefed main and the big jib leaving the mizzen 
up as well. The next morning despite the large sea we had a double Dorado hit 
on the lines much to the delight of Amiria and Noel who were on watch at the 
time.<br>
<br>
The forecastle hatch had one half of it sanded and varnished 
before we got to Cocos Keeling and now that we were back at sea Gareth and Noel 
decided to continue the task.<br>
<br>
The sea was still quite big with the 
auto-pilot working hard to keep us on course. The pump itself does get quite 
hot from its vigorous work, but all in all it is has proven to be an extremely 
useful and brilliant member of the crew, freeing up an extra pair of hands and 
generally making life so much easier.<br>
<br>
Later that evening we had a pair 
of boobies land on the rail showing absolutely no interest in us what so ever 
they promptly went to sleep. They did stay there for most of the night until 
about three the next morning when one of them fell off the rail and landed on 
the deck. After much squawking and running around we picked him a dropped him 
over the side to leave us in peace. About an hour later the other one fell off 
the rail as well but not to be so easily deterred he took off and landed again 
on the mizzen boom where he spent all of the next day as well.<br>
<br>
With 
our stowaway fast asleep we travelled on with a single reefed mizzen and the 
number one jib.<br>
<br>
As evening drew upon us we exchanged the number one 
jib for the medium jib and with a far more relaxed motion we sailed into the 
night. We still had quite a bumpy sea and it was making the auto-pilot work 
very hard so we gave it a break by hand steering through most of the night. The 
next day saw us catching a small Dorado on the hand line, with the credit for 
the catch going to Amiria.<br>
<br>
The fresh fruit supplies are still doing 
well and when ever one of the papayas shows a sign of turning we either make a 
smoothie or a fruit salad, the latter of which is a favourite of Noels.<br>
<br>
So far the weather has been quite kind to us with the odd cloudy day. 
Unfortunately on day seven it started raining late afternoon and quickly turned 
into a downpour. Martin, Jack and Noel quickly took advantage of this and went 
up on deck for an open air shower. It rained on and off for most of the night 
and by the next morning with the buckets full and with the need for the rain 
gone everyone was heartily sick of it.<br>
<br>
The rain finally relented about 
mid morning and it took with it what little wind we had. So the motor came on 
to be complimented by a poled out staysail and the number one jib. With the 
Perkins rumbling on it was beginning to turn into a very slow and lazy 
afternoon when the calm was shattered by a shout from Garth as he hauled in a 
good sized Albacore tuna.<br>
<br>
The next day turned into a beautiful sunny 
day which gave us the opportunity to dry our wet weather gear and anything else 
that got damp. After being cooped up inside for over a day we all spent most of 
the day on deck soaking up the sunshine and doing maintenance work and small 
projects. One such project was a bamboo tankard that Gareth was working on.<br>

<br>With the wind relatively stable and no call for hands on deck, Jack took 
this as an opportunity to spend a few hours performing updates for the Lista 
Light website.<br>
<br>
After a very steady nights progress, that included 
plenty of stargazing but not many miles covered, we launched Brutus at first 
light giving us an acceptable four to five knots. With Brutus giving us an 
extremely comfortable ride there was a hive of activity with everyone doing 
maintenance work or small projects that they have taken upon themselves to do.
<br><br>
The time had also come for the Perkins to have its filter change with 
Martin, assisted by Noel, tackling the task. From day one the Perkins and the 
Lister have both benefited dramatically from Martin's care and expertise and it 
must be said that we all greatly appreciate the fact that he is using his 
professional marine engineering skills to help us out. Martin also devotes a 
large chunk of his time when we are on land either overhauling and checking the 
Perkins and Lister or chasing down oil and parts that are necessary for the 
running of the boat.<br>
<br>
We headed into the evening with a single reefed 
mizzen and the number one jib but by eight o'clock we had dropped them both and 
were steadily motoring into the night. At about seven o'clock the next morning 
we launched Brutus again and prepared ourselves for another strenuous day of 
down wind sailing. Around mid morning disaster struck when our newest coffee 
plunger had a fall and cracked himself down one side. Fortunately for everyone 
Martin got on the case and by the next day it was working beautifully again.<br>
<br>It is now day twelve and we have the mizzen and the staysail goose winged 
to give us a good speed of six knots through the water. Unfortunately we appear 
to be pushing about a knot to a knot and a half of current so what should be 
six knots is only a very disappointing four and a half. The wind direction did 
change slightly for us enabling us to fly the number one jib and take the pole 
off the staysail as well. We all cheered up when Noel caught an extremely large 
albacore tuna on the hand line. Gareth also hooked a similar size tuna on the 
rod, but after fifteen minutes of hard fighting he unfortunately lost it right 
at the boat. Needless to say he was slightly disappointed.<br>
<br>
With a 
hundred and forty miles to go to Chagos we knew that we would not get there at 
our current speed. So we decided to press the Perkins into active service and 
try and get there for midday tomorrow. By nine o'clock the next morning we had 
our first sight of Chagos.<br>
<br>
It was about midday by the time we reached 
the pass and dropped the sails. All the books that we have warned about the 
charts being unreliable so Martin went up the ratlines to eye us in and Amiria 
and Gareth kept lookout on the bow while Jack kept an eye on our progress on 
C-Map.<br>
<br>
Even with C-Map out we made our way across the Atoll with 
relative ease and dropped the anchor off Ile Fouquet. Noel and Amiria were the 
first to swim over to the island closely followed by Jack, Gareth, and Martin 
in the dinghy. We all meet up where two islands were separated by a strip of 
water that had a very fast current gushing into the Atoll.<br>
<br>
After a bit 
of deliberation we decided to walk along the shore a bit more then swim out 
into the pass and let the current take us, then swim for shore when we got to 
the end. We all swam out into the pass at more or less the same time but we 
were very quickly separated. There was an abundance of fish life there which 
included a large moray eel.<br>
<br>
After doing the pass we decided that it 
was defiantly time to head back to the boat and the cold beer that was waiting 
in the fridge. Gareth and Martin took the dinghy back to the boat and Noel, 
Amiria and Jack decided to swim it. Once we were all back aboard the boat with 
a cold beer clasped in our hands we took a moment to enjoy the sunset and 
remember just how lucky we all are.<br>
<br>
After we had all enjoyed a good 
nights sleep we decided that one of the biggest priorities was to get all our 
dirty washing done. So after Jack, Gareth and Martin had done a water run to 
the well on the next Island the washing machine was set up and the mammoth task 
got underway with Gareth as the officer in charge.<br>
<br>
Whilst the washing 
mission was underway Amiria got on with her sanding work on the main wheel, and 
Martin and Noel started caulking the deck near the coach house and Jack was up 
the shrouds taking advantage of the calm anchorage to put up another ratline.
<br><br>
It was late afternoon before the washing was finished and we all 
settled down to enjoy a well earned sun downer. We all spent the next morning 
doing boat maintenance. After lunch however Jack, Martin and Gareth headed over 
to the larger of the two nearer Islands where they snorkelled the pass again 
from the other side seeing their first Chagos turtle and then spent the rest of 
the afternoon exploring the Island.<br>
<br>
Due to the exceedingly warm 
weather most people had taken to sleeping on deck, unfortunately the weather 
can be a little unreliable with it normally raining for two or three minutes 
most nights. We did however get a couple of good nights sleep under the stars.
<br><br>
As we sailed in we spotted a wreck on the outer reef, so the next day 
Jack, Martin and Gareth set off again to have a look at the wreck. It was 
incredibly hard work wading through chest deep water for about a kilometre 
after swimming to the first island, across the pass to the second island and 
walking the length of the second island before heading off across the shallows.
<br><br>
On the way back to the boat we decided to snorkel over the nearby 
wreck of a yacht that had sunk on the reef. In typical yachtie fashion it had 
been stripped of all stainless steel and anything that was salvageable but it 
still made a very interesting snorkel.<br>
<br>
It was three extremely tired 
crew men that boarded Lista that evening. They were greeted by the equally 
tired Noel and Amiria who had spent the day tying and replacing reef lines, and 
giving the mizzen gaff a good birthday.<br>
<br>
Everyone was busy for most of 
the next morning. About mid afternoon we all trooped ashore to have a barbeque 
lunch and a game of volleyball with a couple of people from the surrounding 
boats. It was a thoroughly enjoyable afternoon with some very close games. Jack 
had suffered several small cuts to his left foot and by the next morning it had 
swelled up and was painful enough to make walking difficult. After some 
deliberation Amiria bandaged it up with plenty of her mother's tea tree oil on 
the wound and gave strict orders that he should stay out of the water.<br>
<br>

Leaving Jack on the boat to rest his foot everyone headed off for an afternoon 
of spear fishing and snorkelling. It was a really beautiful snorkel having seen 
a turtle, a black tip reef shark, a lion fish and loads of other tropical fish 
and coral. Noel even managed to bag a good sized grouper with his spear gun.<br>
<br>The next morning we raised the anchor and headed for Peros Bahnos, which is 
another Atoll in the Archipelago. As we motored out of the pass we had a double 
bonito hit on the lines. Martin was first to the rod and after a spirited 
struggle he hauled a good sized bonito onto the boat.<br>
<br>
After we had 
dealt with the fish and cleared the pass we had just enough wind to sail the 
thirty miles close hauled to Peros Bahnos. As the sea was so calm and we had 
the dinghy blown up on deck we decided to launch it and get some action photos 
of Lista Light sailing. Gareth and Martin got in the dinghy and circled around 
us a few times getting loads of great photos.<br>
<br>
We arrived at the Atoll 
of Peros Bahnos at about midday and anchored off Ile de Coin. Ile de Coin is 
one of the few of the islands that has evidence of civilization. The people of 
Chagos were moved away to Thailand in the late sixties, but they do return from 
time to time to visit the graves of their ancestors. All in all the Chagos 
Archipelago is a very isolated place only visited by yachties.<br>
<br>

Everyone trooped ashore to go exploring, except for Noel who stayed on the 
boat. There was rumoured to be some citrus trees on the Island, but after 
searching the length and breadth of the Island we were still fruitless. We did 
however get to see the ruins of the houses and church.<br>
<br>
The next 
morning we headed out to the pass where we anchored for about an hour, so Noel 
and Martin could do a dive.<br>
<br>
Once the dive was over and they were 
safely back on board we raised the anchor and headed out the pass and onto our 
course for the Seychelles. As we came onto our course we had the wind on our 
beam, so we put everything up except for a single reef in the mizzen to give us 
a good speed of five and a half knots. We were still pushing about half a knot 
of current though. We kept trucking along our course for the next three days, 
averaging about five knots, with the same sails. It was mid morning on the 
third day when we had our first fish hit of the passage which was a beautiful 
Dorado. It wasn't until the sixth day that we had a serious sail change to do. 
We dropped the main and jibed the mizzen and jib, only for the wind to change 
and force us to steer miles off of our line. So we jibed it back again and 
settled nicely back onto our course. The lack of sail changes did mean that we 
could get a lot of maintenance work done, or we kept busy by doing small 
projects as usual.<br>
<br>
The current has been getting stronger the closer we 
get to the Seychelles and we are now pushing nearly two knots. The wind did 
pickup on the eighth morning so we raised the main with a single reef in, and 
the staysail to compliment the number one jib and single reef mizzen that we 
already had up. This gave us a very pleasing seven knots through the water but 
we only averaged five knots over the ground. So the Perkins came on to help the 
sails and ensure that we arrive by our first way point early enough to make 
landfall that same day. With the wind came the rain as well, but it was only in 
small showers and they were few and far between. As one small rain cloud went 
in front of us we had a beautiful rainbow that appeared to enter the water 
right in front of us.<br>
<br>
After a frustrating final last night at sea 
where we were constantly either speeding up or slowing down to keep our arrival 
time for the next day. At first light we had our first glimpse of the 
Seychelles.<br>
<br>
It was mid morning by the time we reached the main Island 
called Mahe, unfortunately the beautiful island was obscured by the rain and 
heavy clouds. After a quick conversation with the Port master we tied up to the 
emergency dock to await the customs and immigration. Within an hour the customs 
and quarantine had arrived. They turned out to be very friendly and one of them 
even had a quick play on Martin's guitar, much to everyone's enjoyment.<br>
<br>
Once we had cleared in and done all the formalities we had to leave the 
emergency dock and anchor inside the harbour which was already full of yachts 
and the holding was not very good. After about an hour of messing around we 
finally got the anchor to hold and retired out of the rain to enjoy a good 
hearty lunch and a cold beer.<br>
<br>
After a spot of lunch we inflated the 
dinghy and everyone headed for the shore. The customs guys had recommended a 
local bar called the Pirates Arms as the best place in town so after agreeing 
to meet there we all went our separate ways to explore the town. As the sun 
went down we all laid a course for the bar and settled down to enjoy the first 
draught lager to pass our lips since Darwin. After an hour or so we got talking 
to some local guys that were at another table and they recommended that we move 
on as the beer prices were quite high. Not really sure where we were being led 
he took us to his Salon via the liquor store.<br>
<br>
The owner of the Salon, 
called Ralph, had purchased a large box of beer at the liquor store and 
insisted that we all help him drink it. So with the beer flowing again we 
relaxed in his Salon with some local music. Unfortunately some of us relaxed a 
little bit to much and fell asleep.<br>
<br>
The near constant flow of beer 
started to show some of its effects when Noel decided to test out some of the 
Salon's equipment.<br>
<br>
It was the early hours of the morning when we 
decided that we had better head back to the boat. After leaving Amiria with 
Ralph, who wanted to prolong the evening, we headed back to the boat where we 
realized that we had completely forgotten about dinner. So after a round of 
cheese sandwiches followed by cheese crackers when the bread supply was 
exhausted we collapsed into our bunks. The next morning, despite some of us 
suffering the effects of the previous nights session, we headed into the town 
to do some exploring. The first port of call for most of us was the internet 
caf&eacute; as we had not been near a phone line since Cocos Keeling. We all 
meet at the boat later that evening and we decided that we should visit the 
late night market that was on the other side of town.<br>
<br>
The market was 
full of food stalls and the odd person was there selling fresh fruit and 
vegetables. Martin even chanced upon a stand that was selling Ice Cream much to 
his delight.<br>
<br>
After we had gorged ourselves on the local food we 
retired to the nearby bar and settled down to a cold beer.<br>
<br>
As we were 
nearly out of gas we decided to fill all the canisters at one go so grabbing 
one gas bottle each we headed off to the local gas plant. After quite a walk 
around the complex we finally made it to the bottle filling station where an 
employee filled them for us. Whilst we were waiting for the bottles to be 
filled Gareth decided to test out his latest fashion statement.<br>
<br>
That 
evening we decided to go out for dinner to a pizza restaurant that was on the 
other side of the Island and came recommended by a fellow yachtie. After we had 
all met at the bus stop we jumped on a bus and headed for the restaurant, then 
it was back to town and the Pirates Arms which was a much more lively venue.<br>
<br>Unfortunately as we had all eaten so much pizza we could only manage a 
couple of drinks before retiring back to the boat. Once we were back on the 
boat we did find that we could squeeze in just a couple of whiskies as a night 
cap.<br>
<br>
The next morning, which was Friday, Noel decided to go for a hike 
on the other side of the Island. He stopped at the Internet caf&eacute; on the 
way past and after spending nearly an hour online and not much to show for it 
due to some problems with their computers he left the caf&eacute; in disgust 
and headed for the hills. After rounding a few headlands he came to a beach 
that completely changed his opinion of the Seychelles - it was a piece of 
paradise in paradise.<br>
<br>
On Saturday evening we decided to invite Ralph 
over for a meal aboard Lista to repay his kindness, he very kindly insisted to 
cook a local specialty for us which was absolutely delicious.<br>
<br>
After a 
beautiful dinner we headed for the bar, with the intention of heading for an 
out of town disco, that we had seen advertisements for all week, later on in 
the evening. When we arrived at the club it looked very promising, 
unfortunately when we got inside it turned out there was about fifteen other 
people. We decided to give it a couple of hours to see if it would pick up a 
bit more. Annoyingly it remained quiet, so quiet in fact that Martin fell 
asleep again on one of the sofas.<br>
<br>
Despite the poor turn out the Lista 
Light crew were still seen to be on the dance floor making the best of the 
situation<br>
<br>
After getting thoroughly bored of watching each other dance 
we decided to head back into town where we hoped that it would be a little more 
lively. Unfortunately due to the upcoming elections there had been a bit of a 
riot at the other venue and we decided to pass on going in there. Gareth and 
Martin headed off to get themselves something to eat while Noel and Jack headed 
back to the dinghy. Whilst Gareth and Martin were eating there was another riot 
just next to where they were with tear gas rockets and full riot control police 
as well. Not needing to be told twice they headed back to the dinghy where Jack 
and Noel were already asleep. We had left Amiria in the first night club with 
Ralph where she kept her night alive long after we were all asleep on the boat. 
The next day Gareth, Martin and Jack decided that exercise was the best cure 
for a hangover and headed off for a hike over the hills on the other side of 
the island.<br>
<br>
It was a beautifully hot day for it and when we got to the 
waters edge we could not resist the temptation to go for a swim.<br>
<br>
After 
we had cooled off we decided to walk most of the way back in preference to 
taking the bus. About half way along the beach we decided to stop at a hotel 
bar for a refreshing beverage.<br>
<br>
When we finally dragged ourselves away 
from the beautiful beach and headed back into town we found there was another 
Raleigh going on in town. So after spending a few hours there we grabbed a bite 
to eat and headed back to the boat. The next morning was a rush to do the last 
few things before we left Mahe and headed to the island of Praslin. At about 
eight o'clock Amiria turned up again having spent the weekend with Ralph. As we 
motored out of Port Victoria and headed for the island of Praslin we had a 
Bonito hit the fishing line with Gareth doing battle with the beast.<br>
<br>

We arrived at the anchorage in Praslin with no difficulties and anchored near 
to where all the other yachts were. We spent the afternoon snorkelling and 
exploring the beach before retiring to the boat for some dinner and a glass of 
wine. As you could only buy bottled beer in the Seychelles we stocked up with a 
few litres of wine instead.<br>
<br>
The next day we planned to leave at about 
midday so most of us headed for the shore to do a bit of exploring. Amiria 
headed off over the hills on a bush trek, and Jack and Gareth headed down the 
main road.<br>
<br>
By midday we had all returned to the boat, so the anchor 
was raised and we headed back to the open ocean. It was a fairly uneventful 
first day with Brutus flying for a few hours before evening when we replaced 
him with the mizzen, the number one jib and the staysail poled out on the 
opposite side. As we brought Brutus down he suffered a small rip so Noel got to 
work patching it up the next morning and as soon as it was done Brutus was 
flying again.<br>
<br>
We went into the night with the staysail and the mizzen 
helped out by the Perkins. By morning the wind had picked up enough for a 
double reefed main to hold without engine assistance, so peace reigned on Lista 
again. Jack has turned his hand to making his own fishing lures and having just 
finished one he put it on the rod to prove its worth. Unfortunately it worked a 
little bit to well when a large shark hit it, which nearly emptied the spool of 
line before the cogs overheated and jammed causing the line to snap. It was our 
third night at sea when we crossed the equator at about one thirty in the 
morning. So after a glass of wine to celebrate Lista's return to the Northern 
hemisphere, and one for Neptune of course, we trucked on through the night.<br>

<br>Due to the unsociable our of our equator crossing we decided to have our 
equator party at lunch the following day. In the spirit of the occasion we 
decided that a little bit of fancy dress was required so a quick change later 
and we all posed for a picture.<br>
<br>
After we had crossed the equator we 
pretty much stayed in the doldrums for the next couple of days with the engine 
being actively used a lot of the time which was normally backed up with the 
mizzen and the number one jib. Despite all of the books telling us that that we 
should encounter a current that runs up the African coast it wasn't until day 
five that we noticed we had a knot of current with us. Annoyingly by day six we 
started pushing a current of up to a knot. We were all slightly disheartened by 
this, but it was quickly forgotten when we were called down for dinner by 
Martin who had been working on a Spanish themed dinner.<br>
<br>
By the next 
day we were managing to do about six knots through the water, but due to the 
current that had gone up to three knots against us and combined with the 
confused sea state we only made an average of three knots at best. So with a 
single reefed mizzen and the number one jib helped out by the Perkins to help 
us cut through the confused sea we plodded on. As there was no mention of 
current against us in any of the pilot books that we have we were justifiable 
concerned. So one evening Noel decided to get in touch with he who knows best, 
which consisted of sharing a dram of scotch with Neptune and asking very nicely 
if he could have a look at our counter current problem. The next morning the 
current had changed with us in a matter of ten minutes and we had an Albacore 
tuna strike on the rod. Noel was so pleased with our change of luck that he 
couldn't stop smiling for hours after.<br>
<br>
With the wind just off of our 
port quarter we raced along with a single reefed mizzen, the number one jib and 
the staysail. As there wasn't quite enough wind for the main Noel decided to 
test out his tri-sail idea that he had working on. So we attached the medium 
jib to the main throat halyard and we used the top sail sheet for the sheet. So 
with fingers crossed we hoisted away and stood back to admire our handiwork. In 
all truth we couldn't have asked for any better, so with Lizzie powering on at 
speeds of up to eight knots beneath us we settled back to enjoy the relaxed 
motion.<br>
<br>
The next day the wind kept picking up so we changed the big 
jib for the storm jib and bought the tri-sail down, we also put all three reefs 
in the mizzen. The wind kept picking up throughout the day and we bought down 
the sails accordingly, until we only had a three reefed mizzen and the storm 
staysail which still gave us a speed of nearly seven knots in the thirty five 
to forty knot winds. The sea had come up with it with the odd big wave breaking 
over us.<br>
<br>
The next day brought little respite from the big sea and the 
wind. We even estimated the wave size at around the eight metre mark. Whenever 
a particularly big wave came through and crashed into our quarter the spray 
would regularly reach halfway up the mizzen mast. Despite the unpleasant and 
tiring conditions life went on aboard Lista with some real heart warming 
dinners being made and the bread making was taken to new extremes with everyone 
competing for the Hovis challenge.<br>
<br>
Fortunately as we neared our way 
point of the conditions moderated enough for us to come onto our new course 
which brought the sea onto our beam. With the wind at a more useable speed we 
hoisted the tri-sail to compliment the staysail, a single reefed mizzen and the 
storm jib. With the sea now on our beam we were rocked about even more with 
large waves coming over the side on a regular basis. As we approached the next 
waypoint we had turn even tighter to the wind in order to follow our course 
around Suqutra we had the Perkins helping on and off as the wind varied. Once 
we were clear of Suqutra we came onto our course for Aden occasionally managing 
to sail without assistance but the majority of the time the Perkins was helping 
out as well. We did have a coalition warship come and circle us a few times. We 
had a quick chat with him on the V.H.F. and he confirmed that he had just had a 
safe run down from Aden.<br>
<br>
On the morning of day fifteen we had a hit on 
the rod. As Jack was the only person on deck at the time he hauled it in 
himself unfortunately as he got it on board it flapped towards him stabbing him 
in the leg with the second hook that was sticking out of its mouth. Amiria 
hearing the commotion rushed up on deck and quickly cut the trace so Jack and 
the Dorado were no longer attached. With the aid of a scalpel and a pair of 
pliers he cut the skin around the hook and pulled the barb out through his 
flesh before cutting off the barb and removing it completely.<br>
<br>
We had 
been pushing about a knot of current for the last few days now and it has just 
picked up to about three knots. Our instruments were giving us conflicting 
information in regards to our heading and distance covered so we put out the 
trailing log to give us yet another opinion.<br>
<br>
After putting all of our 
readings together we realized that we were getting pushed about thirty degrees 
off of our line by a North Easterly current. As we were only making about two 
knots with the engine on at a thousand revs diesel, we realized, was going to 
be an issue. Noel spent the next couple of hours checking the charts trying to 
work out what our other options were. He decided in the end to head to Mukalla 
where we hoped to be able to fill with diesel. As we came onto our new course 
we were able to hoist the mizzen, the tri-sail and the number one jib and with 
this combination we were able to give the Perkins a well earned rest. We lost 
the wind at about midnight and had to motor through the night. The next morning 
brought our first sight of Yemen with it and we had anchored off Mukalla by 
eight o'clock to await the customs and immigration.<br>
<br>
At about midday we 
were allowed to go into the main harbour where we tied up to a fishing boat. We 
were greeted at the dock by a friendly bloke who introduced himself as an agent 
and offered to help us out with diesel and water. Once we had finished with the 
formalities we headed into town where we got some local currency and some fresh 
fruit. We were duly surprised by the size of the town and the fact that they 
had an ATM machine and an innumerable amount of local shops as the pilot book 
described it as a dusty little town with only a couple of shops. After kicking 
our heels for a few hours whilst waiting for a fishing boat to move away from 
the dock so we could take his place and fill up with diesel, we got a call from 
the harbour master who said we could just tie up alongside him and fill up that 
way. Once we had finished filling up with diesel and water and deck loaded 
seven more jerry cans it was dark but we decided to head out anyway so with 
full tanks and dinner on the stove we headed back to the open sea. It was a 
fairly non-eventful run to Aden after that. We took the rum line directly to 
Aden which was basically a motor job. The wind would die at about nine o'clock 
in the evening and it would stay flat calm all through the night until about 
ten in the morning when it would pick up until the sea got some chop to it and 
we were averaging just under a knot. We got our first glimpse of Aden late 
afternoon on our third day from Mukalla. After carefully weaving our way 
through the channel we eventually arrived in the anchorage and got the anchor 
down just after mid night. In traditional Lista fashion we decided to polish 
off the last of a white wine cask and a few glasses of rum before retiring to 
bed.<br>
<br>
Despite the fairly late arrival in Aden we were all up early the 
next morning and we got our first look at the town. After we had all eaten and 
made ourselves presentable we headed for the town to clear customs and 
immigration.<br>
<br>
After we had been to see all of the officials we were 
issued with shore passes and allowed to go and explore the town. Aden is a 
sprawled out, dusty town which has an incredible amount of history in it. 
Contrary to what we were told in Mukalla we found everyone in Aden to be very 
friendly and welcoming without expecting anything in return. We were also 
pleased to see that there were plenty of shops and street stalls selling a wide 
variety of fresh food and other basics.<br>
<br>
Just after we had left Mukalla 
we found that the alternator had died which meant that we had to run the Lista 
instead of relying on the Perkins. So the first priority for Noel was to 
investigate the possibility of getting it repaired or getting a replacement.<br>
<br>It was fairly late in the evening by the time we had all met back at the 
boat and as everyone was tired we decided to head into town for a feed. After 
picking a restaurant we sat down and moments later we had a plate of Spanish 
omelette each and a plate of mixed bean stew each and as many chapattis as we 
could eat. After we had devoured all of this and were feeling exceedingly full 
we got the bill which was the equivalent of two US dollars for all of us. After 
settling up Noel concluded that this was his type of restaurant. On the way 
back we chanced upon some kids playing with a table football game. Not being 
able to resist the temptation Gareth and Martin challenged them to a game.<br>

<br>After an exceedingly embarrassing defeat of one goal to four we decided to 
leave them to their game and retire to the boat. The next morning we all took 
the opportunity to catch up on the long job list that we had. Noel and Amiria 
resumed the alternator mission, Gareth toured the local shops to try and buy 
some of the harder to find items on the ''to get'' list, Martin stayed on the 
boat servicing the engine, and Jack started on the website update mission. Dusk 
had fallen again by the time the last crew member had arrived back on Lista and 
the vote was unanimous for dinner ashore again. The next day we amassed our 
mountain of washing and ferried it ashore to where our local agent come taxi 
driver, Omah, was waiting for us. After we had dropped off the washing we 
headed for the supermarket in Omah's car where we got the majority of our 
provisioning done.<br>
<br>
The next couple of days we spent running around 
trying to get everything done on our lists. Noel and Martin spent a lot of time 
on the boat catching up with maintenance jobs and servicing the faithful 
Perkins. One of these jobs included refitting and resealing the saloon windows 
which had burst open when an exceedingly large wave hit us on the way here.<br>

<br>Whilst Noel and Martin were on the boat Gareth, Jack and Amiria did the 
fresh fruit and vegetable provisioning at the local market.<br>
<br>
We had 
decided that we wanted to leave on the fourth day fairly late in the evening as 
we still had stuff that we wanted to do through the day. As the evening drew in 
we decided that we would go ashore for dinner before leaving as the local food 
was so good and the price made it taste all the better.<br>
<br>
After another 
beautiful dinner we popped past the immigration and picked up our passports 
before returning to the boat to make ready for sea. Annoyingly as we brought 
the anchor in it snagged on something pretty solid and despite our best 
attempts it wouldn't budge. So Noel and Jack donned their masks and snorkels 
before jumping in to see what they could do about it.<br>
<br>
After a number 
of duck dives they found the anchor and saw that it was wrapped around a big 
mooring chain. After about twenty minutes of struggle they finally freed the 
anchor and we set off on our way out of the harbour. Once we had got clear of 
the channel we started on our course for Bab El Mandeb and the beginning of the 
Red Sea with the intention of stopping at Safaga in Egypt to refuel and 
provision for the final run up the Gulf of Suez. The next day bought a hazy 
morning with plenty of other ships for company. We were still making good 
progress with an almost flat calm sea. At seven o'clock on the second day we 
came through Bab El Mandeb and into the Red Sea. To celebrate Noel decided that 
a hair cut was the order of the day with Amiria very kindly offering to do the 
job.<br>
<br>
Our entrance to the Red Sea was made even better when we had a 
hit on the rod which resulted in a fair sized barracuda being landed. Everyone 
was delighted with the capture as it was our first fish of the passage.<br>
<br>
Later that day we were motoring along on a calm sea when we spotted a whole 
load of yellow jerry cans in front of us. We soon realized that they were 
fishing floats from the local fishing boats that were scattered around the 
place. So we took evasive action and avoided the first set of floats only to 
notice another set a little further on. This carried on for the whole afternoon 
with the odd fishing boat coming over to check us out as we went past.<br>
<br>

The next day brought pretty much the same hot sweaty conditions with 
temperatures reaching thirty seven degrees below decks with the sea temperature 
being the same. It was mid-morning and everyone was trying their best to keep 
cool under the sun shades when Gareth spotted some very large fins in the water 
in front of us. Everyone rushed to the bow and as they drew closer we 
recognized them to be whale sharks.<br>
<br>
After staring at them mesmerized 
for a few seconds there was a mad rush for the masks and snorkels and Noel, 
Jack and Martin threw themselves over the side to go and make friends with 
these gentle giants.<br>
<br>
After twenty minutes Noel went back to the boat, 
the minute he was back aboard Gareth and Amiria had jumped in to join the fun. 
In total we had a full forty minutes with six of these beautiful creatures 
circling us. They did not seem to mind us at all and we would regularly get 
within arms reach of them. Eventually of course we did drag ourselves away to 
resume our course and leave the sharks to their relaxed feeding. Even our swim 
in the sea brought little respite from the heat as the temperature of the water 
was thirty seven degrees. After getting heartily sick of the heat Gareth 
decided to try a new approach and got people to repeatedly throw buckets of 
water over him whenever they were wetting the decks.<br>
<br>
Over the past few 
days we had seen quite a lot of different birds landing on deck. This included 
a trio of swifts who showed absolutely no fear of us and enjoyed a free run of 
the boat. One was even seen to have a particular liking for Gareth, much to the 
amusement of everyone else.<br>
<br>
Over the next few days dolphins were a 
regular sight with pods of up to fifty of them swimming around the boat at one 
time. No matter how many times we saw them we could not get over the sheer 
beauty and grace that they portrayed.<br>
<br>
As Murphy's law dictates when we 
were one day away from Suakin off the coast of Sudan the wind picked and the 
sea state came up with it causing regular waves to come over the bow. This 
upset everyone's attempts to sleep on their usual patch on deck and the near 
thirty five degree heat down below had to be endured. Mid-morning the next day 
saw our first sight of the Sudanese coast and by mid afternoon we were motoring 
into the entrance of the harbour. As we entered the harbour we left a small 
island in the channel to our port side which was covered in beautiful old 
ruined buildings and mosques.<br>
<br>
Once we had anchored we got onto the 
harbour control who phoned an agent who came out to us on a boat and ran 
through the formalities with us. After we had arranged with him to deliver six 
hundred litres of diesel to us the next morning. Unfortunately as none of us 
had any money and Noel had spent the last of his money on the diesel we had 
nothing left with which to buy a shore pass, but after a quick chat with our 
friend he said it was alright for us to visit the island with the ruin on it as 
long as we didn't go across the bridge to the mainland. Gareth and Amiria swam 
over to the Island followed by Martin and Jack a few minutes later in the 
dinghy and they set off to explore the Island which was meant to be the last 
city to stop trading in slaves.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately before we had finished 
exploring the island we chanced upon a group of men who beckoned us over and 
explained that you had to buy a ticket to be allowed on the island. Not needing 
to be told twice we apologized and headed for the dinghy. The next day we were 
expecting the diesel at eight o'clock but not holding our breath we started on 
the job list now that we were not moving. Noel, Gareth and Martin did some 
recaulking work around some of the stanchions where the pitch was looking a bit 
tired and Jack and Amiria busied themselves with other jobs that needed doing.
<br><br>
At about eleven thirty our diesel finally turned up so we started the 
job of siphoning it into our jerry cans and tanks. Annoyingly when we were 
decanting the first container into our jerry cans we noticed there was water in 
it. After pouring the rest of a container into a bucket to see the amount of 
water in the diesel and to prove to our agent that there was water in it we put 
it to one side to await the painstaking task of skimming the diesel off of the 
top.<br>
<br>
Fortunately the rest of the diesel was good and clean. It was 
late afternoon by the time we had finished the caulking and cleaning up after 
the diesel. Instead of staying here for another night and not being able to go 
ashore we decided to head back to sea, so with more that one backward glance we 
motored out of the channel and back onto our old course that would get us clear 
of the land. With the wind just off of our port side we decided to raise the 
staysail accompanied by the tri-sail and with this configuration we sailed into 
the evening. By midnight we had cleared the land and brought our sails down so 
we could come onto our course for Safaga again with the wind on our nose just 
for a change. The next morning the sweltering heat returned again with the sun 
rise and we raised the most used canvas on our Red Sea passage.<br>
<br>
So 
after our brief interlude at Suakin we resumed our daily trudge on towards 
Safaga. On the second of August we crossed the Tropic of Cancer and officially 
said good bye to the Tropics and we are looking forward to some slightly more 
temperate climates.<br>
<br>
As we got closer to Safaga the sea state began to 
pick up along with the wind and our speed began to drop off with it. The next 
day just to add insult to injury the current turned against us and our speed 
dropped off till we were doing less than one knot..<br>
<br>
So after some 
consideration Noel decided to try doing a couple of tacks with the plan that 
the last tack would take us into Safaga itself. So after hoisting the storm 
jib, staysail, tri-sail and the mizzen we sailed off in a Northerly direction 
helped out as ever by the trusty Perkins. Just as we started to lose the light 
that evening we tacked again and came onto our course for Safaga. We had 
recently noticed a small weak point on the staysail where some of the stitching 
has come undone but thought that it would last until we got to Safaga. 
Unfortunately that night when Amiria and Jack where on watch it ripped with the 
sound of a gun going off. As soon as they realized what had happened they 
rushed up the deck and hauled it down before it flogged itself to death.<br>

<br>Once we got the staysail down and took it off of the stay we replaced it 
with the storm staysail and with our speed slightly reduced we sailed onwards. 
It was three o'clock that morning when we reached our waypoint and brought the 
sails down and motored through the many reefs present around Safaga. We got 
through the channel with no problems and anchored in a bay where all of the 
dive boats stay on moorings. It was now five in the morning so we all collapsed 
into our bunks. The next morning when we emerged from our bunks we were greeted 
by Egypt's beautiful landscape.<br>
<br>
Despite the early arrival we all 
mustered ourselves and headed for the shore to clear in and arrange for our 
cruising permit and visas. After we had hauled the dinghy up the beach next to 
a dive center we hailed one of the many mini-buses that run between the hotels 
and town and headed for the bank and town. After spending all morning and most 
of the afternoon going from person to person we finally had our visas and 
cleared the rest of the formalities. After a spot of lunch at a local 
caf&eacute; we headed downtown to have a look around and get a feel for the 
place.<br>
<br>
There were plenty of shops all over the place and the locals 
were a friendly bunch but after visiting a few of the shops and purchasing some 
fresh vegetables we headed back to the hotel strip. Once we were back there 
Gareth, Martin and Jack headed for an internet caf&eacute; in the hotel while 
Noel and Amiria headed off to enquire about the facilities that were on offer. 
While the boys were in the internet caf&eacute; Gareth spotted a fridge that 
held cold beer. So with the first cold beer to grace our lips since the 
Seychelles firmly grasped in our paws we settled down in front of our computers 
to let everyone know of our long awaited arrival. Once we had finished at the 
internet caf&eacute; we headed off to the dive center where we met Noel and 
Amiria at the bar there. After a few more beers there with one of the local 
dive instructors, we headed back to the boat for dinner. After dinner the call 
of the beer was to strong to resist so Gareth, Noel, Jack and Martin headed 
back to the bar where met our friend again and enjoyed another cold beer and a 
local shisha pipe of apple tobacco.<br>
<br>
After a few rounds at the bar, and 
despite Jack falling asleep for the first half an hour, we decided to head for 
a local night club. On arrival with everyone's second wind going strong the 
beer call was swiftly answered with a chorus of delighted shouts.<br>
<br>
With 
a few more rounds under our belt the temptation soon became to much to resist 
and the Lista Light crew was seen to grace the dance floor pulling moves that 
only a Mother could love.<br>
<br>
On our way back our friend insisted that we 
stop past another club that was on the way and despite a few objections we were 
ushered into the next club. After several more beers that we had pressed upon 
us by our friend we hit the dance floor once again until the early hours.<br>

<br>Despite a fairly late start we spent the day doing boat chores and working 
through the ever present to do list. About mid-afternoon Noel, Gareth and 
Amiria headed off into town in search of an internet caf&eacute; among other 
things, leaving Jack and Martin on the boat finishing their own chores. Whilst 
ashore Gareth and Noel decided to push the boat out and have a bath 
unfortunately they forgot a vital element, water.<br>
<br>
The next day Martin, 
Noel, and Amiria started the diesel mission with the help of our agent Hanjib. 
It took three runs with an extremely overloaded dinghy to transfer the six 
hundred litres of diesel in jerry cans to Lista and back.<br>
<br>
Whilst this 
was going on Gareth and Jack had headed into town to start on the provisioning. 
After touring a large majority of the shops they purchased most of what was 
needed. After heading back to the boat to off load their purchases they 
returned to do the fresh fruit and vegetable shop accompanied this time by 
Martin.<br>
<br>
Martin and Noel had arranged to do a dive the next day so they 
hit the sack early that evening promptly followed by everyone else. Noel and 
Martin headed off on a dive boat early the next morning and everyone else did 
their own thing for the day.<br>
<br>
It was late afternoon before everyone met 
at the dive center where Noel and Martin were enjoying a refreshment after 
their dive.<br>
<br>
We spent the next day doing the last few bits that needed 
doing with the intention of going to sea that evening. It was late afternoon by 
the time we were ready so the anchor came up and we headed back out to the open 
sea to tackle the last two hundred miles of the Red Sea rumoured to be the 
hardest part due to the shipping lanes and the multitude of oil rigs.<br>
<br>

By the next morning we had settled back into the now familiar routine of 
slogging into the wind, except now we were entering the bottle neck near the 
Suez where we were never lacking the company of some large ship or another.<br>

<br>Unfortunately due to the large sea and the wind knocking our nose around 
the auto-pilot just couldn't cope so we had to resort to hand steering her 
again.<br>
<br>
We spent the next few days keeping just outside the shipping 
lane passing plenty of oil rigs that would light the night sky with their 
burners. It was day four from when we left Safaga when we crossed the shipping 
lane and headed for an anchorage on the other side where we could decant some 
of our jerry cans into our tanks. After negotiating the entrance we dropped the 
anchor in the bay where we were sheltered from the swell but the reef gave us 
little protection from the wind. It was early evening by the time we had 
finished filling the tanks and we decided to stay for the night and carry on 
first thing in the morning. After a beautiful mixed vegetable stir fry and 
noodle dinner, Martin surprised us all by producing a beautiful treacle tart 
complimented by a huge pot of custard, needless to say it did not last the 
night.<br>
<br>
After a fairly early start we headed back onto our course 
dodging the many fishing boats on the way. We were greeted by our first glimpse 
of Suez in the early hours of the next day. It was about six o'clock by the 
time we had scrabbled our way up the channel and after some vague instructions 
from the harbour master we finally found our anchorage and anchored to await 
our agent. Within half an hour our agent was on board and we were allowed to 
proceed onto the yacht club. We were given the use of their hose their with 
which we proceeded to fill our tanks. Once the tanks were full we turned our 
attention to the rest of boat and washed the encrusted salt out of all the 
ropes and sails and gave Lizzie an all round fresh water birthday.<br>
<br>

After a quick chat with some of the blokes on the shore we arranged for some 
diesel and beer to be delivered to the boat. As it was going to take a couple 
of hours we moved onto the moorings that were provided. A couple of hours 
later, as promised, the diesel boys turned up and we soon had our tanks full 
again.<br>
<br>
With the two most pressing jobs out of the way we headed for 
the town to see what it had to offer, with Martin opting to stay on the boat as 
he had jobs he wanted to do.<br>
<br>
After having scoped out a few of the 
stores in town and spent an hour or so online we returned to the boat to await 
the beer delivery. Noel had very kindly arranged for everyone to take a trip to 
Cairo the next day as it would be the only chance before we went through the 
canal the day after. With this in mind we rationed ourselves to only a couple 
of beers to toast our landfall with. The next day we set off to Cairo with our 
guide. It was an hour and a half drive to the centre of Cairo where we were 
first dropped off at the Museum. It was a fair sized museum that was absolutely 
cram packed with artefacts, and we also got to see the Royal Mummies. We 
unfortunately could not get any pictures of the museum as camera's were banned. 
On the way to the Pyramids we requested a lunch stop at one of the local cafes 
instead of the far more expensive tourist restaurant by the pyramids. After an 
interesting lunch we spotted a smoothie shop across the road. Being unable to 
resist we popped over for a smoothie for dessert.<br>
<br>
Once we had finished 
what we had concluded to be the best smoothie that we had bought (Gareth's 
smoothies still remaining the number one.), we clambered back into the van with 
the next stop being the Pyramids. On arrival we decided to hire some camels for 
the trek up to the Sphinx and the Pyramids.<br>
<br>
The first stop was at the 
Sphinx.<br>
<br>
Once we had alighted from our camels we went off to explore 
the temple next to the Sphinx before climbing up the walls to get a picture or 
two.<br>
<br>
The next stop was by the largest pyramid where we were allowed to 
climb up the first few levels for another picture of the Lista Light crew.<br>

<br>We then took the camels up one of the nearby dunes where could see all of 
the pyramids below us. It was truly a magnificent sight and we were all held 
spell bound by this wonder of the world.<br>
<br>
After we had returned we had 
a few hours to spare before the sound and light show started in front of the 
pyramids, so we decided to explore Cairo a bit before the show. After touring 
some of the local shops and generally making friends with the locals we headed 
off for the show. The show consisted of the pyramids and the sphinx being lit 
up with multi-coloured lights and a talk about its history.<br>
<br>
Once the 
show had finished we headed back to the boat all heartily exhausted. This 
however did not stop us enjoying a few cold beers on arrival at the boat. The 
next morning we were all up early to await the arrival of the pilot. While we 
were waiting there was a steady stream of container boats coming past us on 
their way up the canal. Never one to pass up on a photo opportunity Gareth 
jumped over the side with Jack's marine camera case and swam to another boat to 
capture the moment.<br>
<br>
About ten minutes later we had the pilot come 
aboard and we motored into the canal. It was fairly straight forward run with 
not much to see part from plenty of container ships overtaking us and there was 
a lot of military presence all along the shore.<br>
<br>
On arrival at the lake 
in the middle of the canal our pilot jumped off we then cast off the lines 
again and picked up a mooring. As we had already cleared out of Egypt we were 
not allowed to go and explore the town, but we were free to go and explore the 
yacht club and have dinner there. So after a very satisfying dinner ashore we 
retired to the boat and our bunks in anticipation of an early start the next 
day. We were all up early doors the next day but much to our annoyance the 
pilot turned up five hours late. As soon as we had him on board we headed 
straight back into the canal and on our way.<br>
<br>
The second leg was pretty 
similar to the first apart from this time we had lots of local fishing boats 
for company. The locals would row their way against the wind up the canal 
fishing as they went and at the end of the day they would put up a jury rigged 
mast and square sail to sail back down the canal.<br>
<br>
Noel and Gareth did 
give themselves a quick workout when they hauled Jack up the mast to get a 
birds eye picture of the canal.<br>
<br>
It was dark by the time we arrived in 
Port Said and after discharging our pilot we motored out through the channel 
and into the long awaited Mediterranean Sea. The next day at lunch we opened 
the bottle of Champagne that we had been given by Mark and Quintin S.V. Skardu 
in New Zealand and used it to toast our latest milestone - many thanks Skardu!
<br><br>
As the Champagne was so nice we drank the lot on our own completely 
forgetting about Neptune. To make up for it we gave him a generous measure of 
the whisky that we had picked up in Suez.<br>
<br>
It seems that Neptune was 
duly pleased with the alternative as we landed a large big eye tuna the next 
day. Our first, and hopefully not the last.<br>
<br>
On the twenty second, 
Jay's Birthday, we baked a cake specially for the occasion, unfortunately we 
had nothing to toast her health with so settled for a cup of tea and a second 
piece of cake to make up for it. Happy Birthday Jay and all the best from the 
Lista Light crew.<br>
<br>
The next day Noel made the decision to head for 
Crete as our diesel situation was not good after five days of constant 
motoring. This change of course gave us a slightly better wind angle to work 
with so we put up the number one jib, staysail, single reefed main and a single 
reefed mizzen. We still had to motor sail it as we were to close hauled to make 
our course without help. The next morning as we got closer we raised our Crete 
courtesy flag that Amiria had made and strained our eyes for our first glimpse 
of Crete.<br>
<br>
Most of the way there Crete was covered in clouds but once 
we got closer it cleared up and we had our first glimpse of the harbour that we 
were heading for.<br>
<br>
By two thirty that afternoon we had entered the 
harbour and tied up alongside the breakwater. On arrival a fellow yachts men 
had come over and very kindly said he would phone the diesel man for us. A 
brief phone call later and we had our diesel delivery scheduled for early the 
next morning.<br>
<br>
With our biggest job out of the way we decided to head 
into the village for an exploration mission. After a walk around the village we 
found a Jazz and Blues bar run by a very friendly British guy, after ordering a 
round of drinks we settled back to take in the relaxed and friendly community 
atmosphere of the village.<br>
<br>
After a couple more of the local beers, we 
decided to sample some of the local Ouzo. Unfortunately in Crete there is no 
such thing as a measure, so the large glasses that we were presented with we 
assumed were single measures topped up with water. A few hours later and 
several more rounds of beer and Ouzo we found out the hard way that they were 
in fact triple measures. Being more than slightly the worse for wear we decided 
that it would be a good idea to head back to the boat where we all collapsed to 
sleep it off. Despite our heavy evening we were all up to greet the diesel man 
who arrived at eight, after we had filled up our tanks we all dispersed to go 
and do our own thing. Noel donned his dive gear and went over the side to 
scrape the barnacles, while everyone else busied themselves either with the 
provisioning or other maintenance jobs. It was late afternoon before we had 
finished everything and were ready for sea, so with more than one reluctant 
look over our shoulder we headed back out into the open sea.<br>
<br>
It was 
our second day out of Crete and we were motor sailing along nicely with the 
number three jib, staysail, triple reefed main and a double reefed mizzen, when 
the weather changed and we had plenty of big squally clouds come over the 
horizon. We dodged most of the clouds but there was one at about mid afternoon 
that was on a collision course for us. So in preparation for it we brought the 
main down and kept on going. As it got closer it just looked like there would 
be a load of rain but nothing much else. All of a sudden we were hammered by 
winds of up to forty knots and slashing rain. We all rushed to claw down the 
sails as Lizzie roared on beneath us. Once we had the sails down and the 
running backstays in position we all took a breath and Jack grabbed the 
opportunity to get his camera and take some pictures.<br>
<br>
We motored the 
rest of the day as the wind was variable and there were still plenty of ugly 
looking clouds around. By midday the next day we caught our first glimpse of 
Malta and as we had no pilot books to help us out we called up the harbour 
master, who finally recommended that we head for the Grand Harbour Marina. As 
we closed in on the entrance to the harbour we were met by a zodiac and they 
very kindly led us through the meandering channel towards the marina. As we 
came into the harbour we were greeted by the beautiful architecture that Malta 
has.<br>
<br>
Once we had passed through the channel and dodged the tanker that 
was manoeuvring out of it, we came to the Marina and tied up to the pontoon.<br>
<br>We were all extremely relieved to reach Malta at last and we had a cup of 
tea to celebrate as it was still early in the afternoon. After it was finished 
we all headed off to complete the formalities, once it was done we all headed 
off to explore the town and admire the beautiful architecture that we got a 
glimpse of as we entered the harbour.<br>
<br>
We all spent the last of the 
daylight hours exploring the many passage ways that seemed to go on forever. 
There was something to see at every corner and the pictures that we took can 
barely portray the beauty of the streets of Malta.<br>
<br>
We all met back at 
the boat as the evening drew in and after a good hearty dinner Martin, Noel, 
Jack and Gareth headed off to one of the local bars before hitting the main 
clubs in town. After a fun filled night on the town with many clubs being 
visited we retired to the boat. The next day everybody mooched around doing 
their own thing which consisted of some time on the internet and plenty of 
exploring.<br>
<br>
Early Monday morning Gareth, Martin and Jack headed off to 
do the dry goods provisioning. After speaking to the local information desk we 
headed off to the biggest supermarket in the immediate vicinity. On arrival we 
discovered almost forgotten luxuries like English mustard and Marmite. Once we 
had stowed our purchases Gareth headed back out to start on the fresh vegetable 
side leaving Jack to start on the website update.<br>
<br>
After enquiring 
about laundry services we discovered them to be extremely expensive so Gareth, 
Jack and Noel spent most of the next day working their way through a massive 
washing pile.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately Martin has decided to leave the boat here 
as we are taking longer than we initially planned and he wanted to get his 
yacht master certificate before they stopped the courses for the winter. So 
after looking around a bit he got himself a flight for the next morning. As it 
was going to be Martin's last night on Lista we took him out for a meal and a 
few drinks, followed by a few drinks on Lista before we retired. We roused 
ourselves the next morning to give him a Lista send off, and we look forward to 
the reunion with him in Bristol. As we were intending on leaving today Noel 
spent an hour or so in the engine room giving everything a once over. 
Everything looked good until he checked our fresh water filter which was 
clogged up with sand from the dirty water we had picked up in Yemen.<br>
<br>

By mid afternoon we had settled up our bill with the marina and we motored out 
of the harbour. Once we were out there we decided to try our luck with the 
fickle breeze and all the sails went up with one reef in the mizzen and the 
main. Even with all of our toys out we still needed the ever faithful Perkins 
to keep our momentum going. By evening we had lost the wind completely and the 
sails came down. It was a clear night and we experienced our first quite cold 
night for a long time. So cold in fact that people were even seen to be doing 
their night watch in their full wet weather gear.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately by the 
next morning the wind had picked up again and surprise, surprise it was dead on 
the nose. We were now picking up weather reports on the V.H.F. and one was 
heard to say that there was a force eight gale coming our way. Being heartily 
sick of the short sea and not looking forward to it getting any worse we 
decided to head for a harbour in nearby Sicily to weather the gale over before 
venturing out again. Two short tacks later saw us heading for the harbour.<br>

<br>Unfortunately directly in our path were two fishing trawlers that forced us 
to bear away to pass them causing us to completely lose the ground that we had 
slogged into the short sea for much to annoyance of everyone. We kept going as 
close to the wind as we could until we were in the lee of the island and then 
we motored onto our chosen harbour that we just got into as the sunset behind 
us.<br>
<br>
After a quick chat with customs on the VHF we were given 
permission to tie up on the fishing wharf for the night and after a quick visit 
from the officials we were free to do as we liked. So after a good hearty 
dinner and a glass of very acceptable white wine we decided to go and see what 
the town had to offer. We did chance upon a bar where some locals were enjoying 
a beer. After enjoying a couple of beers with them, tiredness saw us retiring 
to the boat shortly after. We were greeted with a beautifully calm day the next 
morning so after we had picked up a few things from the chandlery and decanted 
some of our jerry cans into our tanks we left Sicily's fair shores and motored 
onwards with the staysail up as our mandatory piece of canvas and a stowaway in 
the form of a Robin on board.<br>
<br>
On leaving the harbour we hugged the 
shore line as close as we dared and enjoyed a nice flat sea and no wind. Once 
we came out of the lee of Sicily we found the wind coming out of the North West 
again, so we raised the number one jib, staysail, single reefed main and single 
reefed mizzen and we motor sailed just off of our course with a fair turn of 
speed. By the next morning however we were to far off of our track so down came 
the sails and we motored into the wind. Over the next few days we caught plenty 
of small Dorado, our best being four in one day, but most of them were returned 
to fight another day with us only keeping two of the larger ones.<br>
<br>
Over 
the next couple of days the wind started coming more out of the North so all 
the sails went up and we motored sailed for a while. Unfortunately the wind 
died down to an unusable amount, but we were very glad to see the sea had 
calmed down with it as we motored along at an average of five and a half knots. 
As the sea was so calm there were many maintenance jobs being done which 
included Gareth finishing his lizard, which he was very proud to see doing a 
good job the next day when it was put into active service.<br>
<br>
Jack and 
Noel were on watch one morning when there was an absolutely screaming take on 
the rod. Noel took up the challenge and after ten minutes of hand numbing 
struggle we landed a huge yellow fin tuna. Noel's delight was clear to see as 
he rushed around waking people up to see his prize.<br>
<br>
It was day nine 
when we crossed the Meridian Line. Needless to say a sign was made for the 
occasion and the Lista Light crew gave their best pose for the camera.<br>
<br>

Later the wind moved around behind and we greeted it with a poled out staysail 
and tri-sail. The wind stayed steady through out the night and when morning 
came we suddenly remembered our secret weapon. So we unearthed Brutus and gave 
him a dust down. Soon he was up and flying with all of his former glory. To 
celebrate the occasion we launched the dinghy and Gareth and Jack got in and 
circled the boat several times getting some fantastic pictures of the legendary 
Brutus.<br>
<br>
After a fun filled day of watching the legend fly and calling 
back all of the old spinnaker flying skills, we hauled him down for the 
evening. Annoyingly as we got close the current who's company we had enjoyed 
for the past two days turned against us which pushed our arrival time way into 
the early hours of the morning. As we drew closer to Gibraltar we were greeted 
with an abundance of light from the oil refinery and the town. After creeping 
in around the many tankers and other small freighters that were anchored in the 
bay we dropped our anchor next to the other yachts that were already there and 
we toasted Lizzies latest accomplishment with a cold beer before retiring to 
our bunks.<br>
<br>
The first light of the morning saw everyone up to have a 
look at our surroundings. In typical English fashion it was a grey day and the 
world famous Gibraltar rock was covered in grey clouds.<br>
<br>
After a chat 
with the marina we pulled up the anchor and headed down there. The strong gusts 
of wind did not make our life easy coming into the marina, but we got in there 
with more than one compliment from the neighbouring boats. As we had to come in 
bow first we rigged up a rope ladder from the bowsprit which was a cause of 
jealousy from everyone.<br>
<br>
As we only intend to stay in Gibraltar for one 
more night we all headed off into to town for a quick bite to eat and to do 
some interneting. Before we knew it the afternoon was gone and we decided to 
head over the border to Spain for dinner. After a beautiful Tapas dinner we 
retired to the boat. It was a hectic morning the next day as we attempted to 
get everything done before our twelve o'clock departure.<br>
<br>
As we readied 
the boat for sea Noel went to settle up the marina bill. He came back in a 
filthy mood and he was absolutely disgusted with every aspect of the marina. 
Trying not to let this bad experience affect our mood we motored out of the bay 
and started off on our way to Ceuta. A couple of hours later we came into 
Ceuta's main harbour and tied up in the marina, assisted by the very friendly 
and helpful marina staff.<br>
<br>
We decided to stay in the marina for two 
nights giving everyone the chance to visit nearby Morocco the next day. So 
after doing the fresh vegetable provisioning early in the morning Jack, Gareth 
and Amiria headed off to the border by bus. After getting through the border 
control we sought out a taxi that would take us to the nearest main town. After 
turning down a dozen stupidly high offers a local policeman helped us a find a 
taxi that we shared with four other people and it was a fifth of the price the 
others were asking. Once we arrived we were met by a seemingly friendly local 
who insisted on showing us a market. It was a bustling town with small alleys 
everywhere with hundreds of small shops.<br>
<br>
We were know thoroughly 
annoyed with our follower, who would not take a hint, even when we were verging 
on being rude. Eventually we had had enough and told him that we wanted to 
carry on on our own then two of his mates turned and started shouting all sorts 
of threats at us demanding money, despite us telling him in the beginning that 
we wouldn't give him any. Eventually we decided to give them a handful of 
change and we departed with the help of a friendly local who showed us out of 
the maze of alleys and back into the open market. After this unpleasant 
experience we lost interest in Morocco and as it was late in the day we headed 
back to the border now wiser and less trusting for our experience. We left the 
marina about mid-morning the next day with the plan of catching the tide to 
take us through the Gibraltar Strait.<br>
<br>
Once we were in the shipping 
lane we found out much to our annoyance that we had the tide against us. Noel 
quickly dashed down to work out what was wrong and soon realized that we had 
forgotten to work out the tides into local time. So despite our best laid plan 
we ended plugging the tide and even getting pushed backwards for a while.<br>

<br>We spent the night plugging away with the Perkins covering a fair bit of 
ground until morning when the wind picked up enough for us to hold the mizzen, 
staysail and storm jib. As the day went on the wind backed around even more 
until we were sailing beautifully with the Perkins on just to help keep our 
momentum up.<br>
<br>
The conditions stayed pretty even for the next day with a 
few furious rain squalls that brought little wind but absolutely drenched 
whoever was unfortunate enough to be on watch at the time. Jack has actually 
been christened the Rain Man for his ability to get it to rain on him when ever 
he goes on watch, much to his annoyance I might add. We have been sailing quite 
conservatively so far due to this coastline being particularly notorious for 
bad weather this time of year. We do have the luxury of having a biro graph as 
well as a regular barometer which draws a line on its paper to show us the 
trend. Noel always makes sure that it is regularly serviced to keep it running 
smoothly.<br>
<br>
Noel decided to stop in a small harbour called Cabo Sao 
Vincente just to give everything a quite check over and replace the bobstay 
rope and end to end the main peak halyard.<br>
<br>
Our intention was to leave 
the same day but as it was dark by the time we had finished we decided to stay 
for the night and leave the next morning. For the first time this trip we lit 
the diesel stove which saw us all bare-chested from the heat and after the 
massive dinner that Amiria made we retired to our beds in preparation for the 
early start the next day.<br>
<br>
We were all up bright and early the next 
morning and we motored out of the harbour with first light. There was barely 
enough wind to hold the staysail but it went up none the less.<br>
<br>
By mid 
afternoon we had all the sails up and pulling well and peace reigned aboard the 
Lista again as the Perkins was put to sleep.<br>
<br>
As we have not flown the 
main sail for quite a while it gave us the chance to have a good look at all 
the rigging on it. Noel was delighted to find that it was all still in very 
good condition and was performing well.<br>
<br>
Through out the night the wind 
had been going up and down and we were getting the sails down accordingly and 
by morning we were just left with the staysail and plenty of rain clouds. Even 
with Jack's unlucky trend showing true there wasn't anyone who got away without 
getting a soaking.<br>
<br>
By about eight o'clock the wind had picked up so we 
met it with a double reefed mizzen and the storm jib. The third reef went in 
the mizzen early afternoon with the wind at a force six. The wind stayed fairly 
steady all night but by morning it started picking up again with it at a steady 
force seven gusting up to a force eight. As the wind increased its direction 
changed with it until it was West North West and some rather large waves were 
now hitting us on our beam.<br>
<br>
Noel decided that he would prefer a 
weather forecast before we round Cape Finnistere so we headed for Vigo on the 
Spanish coast. As we crossed the continental shelf the waves increased in size 
so much that we had to resort to hand steering the boat as the auto-pilot 
couldn't cope. The now much heavier seas required a quick hand on the wheel and 
you could not stop concentrating for a moment.<br>
<br>
All of the sails were 
doing extremely well pushing us along at a good speed and we were very pleased 
to see that the shroud protectors that we put on in New Caledonia were still 
doing a superb job.<br>
<br>
Once we had battled our way in behind the Isla 
Cies we dropped the anchor to await the morning and hopefully better 
conditions. The tiredness showed on everyone's face having done battle with a 
good force seven/eight and the big seas that went with it.<br>
<br>
After a big 
Cuban rice dinner made by Gareth who was assisted by Noel we sat back and 
relaxed with a bottle of wine, toasting Lizzie for taking care of us once again.
<br><br>
Having enjoyed a good nights sleep we emerged early in the morning to 
see what changes the night had brought to us. The wind had actually picked up 
to about a force nine so we decided to give it an hour or so to see if it would 
moderate. To pass the time Amiria decided to go for a swim despite being called 
mad by everyone. To say that there was a scream as she hit the water would be 
an understatement!<br>
<br>
After a couple of hours had passed the wind had 
actually picked up to what we estimated to be at least a force ten. So we 
hauled the anchor up and made our way up the river towards the main marina. The 
wind was so strong that the tops were blown off the waves and the spray was 
carried well over a hundred metres. Even the Lista Light with bare poles was 
heeled over to a good twenty degrees at times.<br>
<br>
After we had clawed our 
way up the river to the marina we gratefully tied up to the breakwater as it 
was quite a small marina. With our most pressing priority being to check the 
weather for the next few days most of us trooped off to the internet 
caf&eacute;. Vigo had a myriad of beautiful small old streets that we explored 
in the search of a restaurant for our evening meal.<br>
<br>
After a beautiful 
dinner which we followed with a few shots of a home brewed tequila we retired 
to the boat in preparation for an early start the next morning.<br>
<br>
We 
were all up bright and early the next morning and we headed out of the marina 
and off towards the open sea. Despite it blowing a force eight the sea had not 
built up to an unmanageable proportion so we came onto our course for the 
Scilly Isles. The sea was just big enough to make it hard for the auto-pilot so 
we hand steered with just a poled out staysail.<br>
<br>
By evening however the 
sea had calmed down and we were still making a fantastic speed. By midday the 
next day we had lost the wind all together and were motoring along in a calm 
sea.<br>
<br>
As it was still really calm there was a hive of cleaning activity 
aboard Lista which included much scrubbing and polishing.<br>
<br>
The calm 
weather also gave us the opportunity to make sure that all the rigging was 
still well balanced and we were all very pleased to see that everything was 
still performing well.<br>
<br>
It was our fifth day out of Vigo before we came 
into the Isles of Scilly in the early hours of the morning. We stopped 
alongside the dock to pick up a couple of hundred litres of diesel before going 
and picking up a mooring.<br>
<br>
After dealing the most pressing priorities 
on the to do list we all trooped ashore to have a look around and a swift pint 
in the pub before we left for Lundy Island mid afternoon with the tide. It was 
a fairly tiring night as there was a thick fog giving us a visibility of as 
little as a mile at times but we were greeted by the warming sight of Lundy 
Island the next morning.<br>
<br>
After a good hearty fried breakfast, English 
style, we jumped into the dinghy and headed ashore for an explore.<br>

As 
we hauled the dinghy up the slip we saw some of the resident seals watching us 
with mild curiosity. We decided against risking hypothermia and swimming with 
them even though some people did give it some serious consideration.<br>
<br>

We did a quick tour of the Island which included climbing the Light House 
before heading to the pub for lunch.<br>
<br>
After lunch we headed back to the 
boat stopping for a quick Kodak moment on the way.<br>
<br>
We left the Lundy 
with the wind dead behind us and to greet this almost forgotten feeling we 
raised a double reefed mizzen accompanied by the staysail. With the tide with 
us as well we were making a very comfortable six knots. The only downside of 
this was the wind was bitterly cold causing everyone to wear several layers 
accompanied by our now mandatory full wet weather gear.<br>
<br>
Fortunately 
for us by the time we had negotiated the Bristol channel and entered the mouth 
of the Avon river the autumn sun was out in all of its glory bringing a smile 
to everyone's face.<br>
<br>
As we were slightly early we crept up the river 
with only the tide pushing us along until we were back on schedule, and then 
Lizzie, with the ever faithful Perkins purring beneath us, rounded the corner 
in all her glory to be greeted by our friends and family as we entered the lock.
<br><br>
Once we had got to the top of the lock all of our welcoming committee, 
including the B.B.C. television reporter, got on board and it was smiles all 
around as we motored through the Bristol docks.<br>
<br>
Once we had tied up 
alongside the dock the champagne was brought out of the fridge and the Lista 
Light crew toasted Lizzie for her strength and fortitude in the face of 
adversity and for all the challenges that she has met head on and emerged 
triumphant.<br>
<br>
Soon the Champagne was in full flow and everyone had a 
hundred stories to tell to their friends and family and there were smiles all 
around as people who have been apart for ages were re-united.<br>
<br>
The 
occasion even saw Jack firing up his celebratory cigar much to everyone's 
amusement.<br>
<br>
Once the champagne supply was exhausted the beer was 
cracked open, with Noel enjoying not one but two of his favourites at the same 
time.<br>
<br>
The celebrations carried on late into the night and there were 
some people who were suffering slightly the next morning, but most of us were 
still up bright and early. Over the next few days people have been making their 
own plans and slowly everyone has started gathering their possessions and 
leaving the boat that they have grown to love with a hundred stories that will 
ensure that their friends and family will be entertained for many years.<br>

<br>Lista Light who is now back home where she belongs and with an entire 
circumnavigation under her belt she is going to get the tender loving care that 
she deserves. Though the future for the Lista may be a little hazy, I feel that 
there will always be someone who will love and cherish her and she is 
immortalized in the memories of all the hundreds of people who's lives have 
been changed by her for ever.<br>
<br>
It is just left for me to say thank you 
to Rob for without his support and knowledge I would not have been able to keep 
this website updated. I hope you have all enjoyed living our trip with us and I 
am very proud to have been the person to help this happen.<br>
<br>
Jack.<br>
