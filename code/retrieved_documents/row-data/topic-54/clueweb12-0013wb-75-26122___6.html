<p>Hydrangeas have been a garden favorite in Arkansas for many years.&nbsp; 
They produce large showy pink or blue flowers are gracing many landscapes. Not 
all hydrangeas are the same. Flower color varies by species, with some white, 
pink or blue, some even green. Some will tolerate more sun than others, and 
pruning needs vary by species. With increasing popularity, and new varieties 
emerging every season, there should be a hydrangea for almost every landscape.
</p> 
<p>Choosing the right hydrangea for your yard can be a daunting task. There 
are 23 species of hydrangeas, but five that are commonly available and commonly 
grown. The most common hydrangea grown in our gardens is<i>Hydrangea macrophylla
</i>&#151;the big leaf hydrangea. This hydrangea is the one that produces the 
large pink or blue flowers (depending on pH of the soil) in either mophead form 
or lacecap form. Acidic soils produce blue flowers, while alkaline soils 
produce pink. Aluminum sulfate fertilizer will keep them blue, while lime will 
make them pink. In the neutral zone we have purple blooms.</p> 
<p>Another common hydrangea for woodland gardens is the Oakleaf hydrangea, <i>
Hydrangea quercifolia</i>. This plant has large oak-shaped leaves and panicles 
of white flowers in early summer, which fade to dusty rose and then tan. In 
addition to spectacular flowers, the leaves turn brilliant shades of red in the 
fall landscape.</p> 
<p>The old-fashioned &#145;Annabelle&#146; hydrangea is one of the smooth 
hydrangeas,<i>Hydrangea arborescens</i>. Most smooth hydrangeas have white 
flowers that bloom on the new growth and &#145;Annabelle&#146; blooms are 
fairly large and showy. A new introduction &#145;Invincibelle Spirit&#146; 
produces large pink flowers. Support for the stems is sometimes needed to hold 
the large flower heads.</p> 
<p>Another old fashioned white bloomer is the panicle or PeeGee hydrangea, <i>
Hydrangea paniculata</i>. These plants can grow quite large and are often 
tree-formed. Like the smooth hydrangea, they bloom on the new growth. 
&#145;Pink Diamond&#146; will take full sun and the &#145;Limelight&#146; form 
has greenish white blossoms. Of the hydrangeas, panicle forms will take the 
most sunlight.</p> 
<p>And last, but not least is the climbing hydrangea&#151;a totally different 
form of plant.<i>Hydrangea anomala</i> is a vine that can grow in deep shade 
and still bloom. While it can be slow to get established and start blooming, 
once it does, the lovely white flowers are quite showy.</p> 
<p>All members of the hydrangea family like a rich soil with plenty of 
moisture. Except for the climbing hydrangea, they need some sunlight in order 
to set flowers. Full morning sun or filtered sun with protection from the hot 
afternoon sun is best for most; however, the H. paniculata &#145;Pink 
Diamond&#146; can grow in full sun. Direct afternoon sun on the big leaf 
hydrangea will give you a wilted plant every afternoon regardless of how much 
water they have. Hydrangeas are not drought tolerant plants, needing ample 
moisture to thrive. Fertilize with a slow release fertilizer in early spring 
after all frost has ended. A light application following the first flush of 
flowers can also be used.</p> 
<p>The season of pruning is not the same for all hydrangeas. Some plants bloom 
on the new growth&#151;<i>Hydrangea paniculata</i> and <i>H. arborescens</i>, 
so can be pruned before growth begins in early spring or as they are going 
dormant in the fall. I prefer to prune before new growth so there is at least 
some structure in the winter garden. Hydrangea<i> macrophylla</i> and <i>H. 
quercifolia</i> bloom on the old growth, so should be pruned immediately after 
flowering if needed.<i> Hydrangea macrophylla</i> typically blooms in early 
summer. It sets its flower buds for the next season on the old wood, after it 
blooms, in late summer to early fall as the days get shorter and temperatures 
cool off. The ideal time to prune&#151;if needed, is immediately as the flowers 
begin to fade. Try to have all pruning done by August. The later they are 
pruned the smaller your flowers will be the next season. Often the earlier you 
get it done after bloom, the quicker the recovery and the more blooms next 
season. There are a few varieties of<i>H. macrophylla</i> that are remontant 
&#150; which means they are capable of having more than one bloom cycle. Two of 
the varieties getting a lot of press now are &#145;Endless Summer&#146; and 
&#145;Blushing Bride.&#146; These<i>H. macrophylla</i> will bloom throughout 
the summer, and will bloom on new growth even if the old growth is winter 
damaged. For remontant types, deadhead the spent flowers throughout the growing 
season, just like you would your perennial flowers. This will encourage them to 
set more flowers. They actually bloom on both the old and the new wood. Try to 
plant your hydrangeas in a location where maximum size can be utilized, and 
this can cut down on your pruning chores. When they do need pruning, remove up 
to one third of the old canes at the soil line either after the first bloom or 
before growth begins in the spring.</p> 
<p>Some gardeners prune a few canes each season, while others wait until the 
plants have overgrown their location, or when the flowers become smaller and 
less showy. If the plant gets old and woody, it can often produce smaller 
blooms. Since hydrangeas produce multiple trunks or canes, pruning cuts should 
remove canes at the soil line. Top-pruning hydrangea canes, will result in 
branching. On Annabelles and PeeGee hydrangeas that works, but<i>H. macrophylla
</i> produces large terminal flower buds on the end of each branch and 
multi-stalked canes can bend over under the weight of multiple flowers. When 
pruning big leaf hydrangeas, cut the older canes out as close to the soil line 
as possible. This should reduce the overall size and height of the plant, while 
leaving ample remaining stems for showy blooms the next season.</p> 
<p>Keep in mind that most hydrangeas are not the most attractive plants in the 
winter. They usually look like a bunch of dead sticks&#151;so don&#146;t have 
them in the most prominent part of your winter landscape. Some gardeners 
erroneously think their big leaf hydrangeas are dead sticks, and prune them to 
the ground each winter. They rarely see a flower on their plants. Protect the 
plants as much as possible in the winter.<i>H. macrophylla</i>, the big leaf 
hydrangea tends to be one of the first plants to begin growing, often in the 
dead of winter. If the terminal bud begins to sprout, (which often happens when 
we have a warm spell in the winter), a following hard freeze can kill the bud. 
When this happens, there are usually smaller flower buds further down on the 
stem which can take their place and bloom in the summer. The flowers produced 
from these smaller buds will not be as large and showy as those from a terminal 
bud, but they are still quite nice. If there is a really hard winter, the 
entire bigleaf hydrangea plant can be killed to the ground. The plant will 
re-grow from the root system, but you will usually have few, if any, blooms 
that growing season, unless you are growing the reblooming types like 
&#145;Endless Summer&#146; and &#145;Blushing Bride.&#146; Oakleaf hydrangeas 
tend to stay dormant longer and rarely have any winter injury. They also can be 
somewhat attractive during the winter, with their shaggy, peeling bark. Smooth 
and panicle hydrangeas are usually immune to winter damage, and even if it 
occurs, since they bloom on the new growth, they still will bloom this growing 
season.</p> 
<p>Deadheading is a process where spent flowers are removed. There are several 
schools of thought about this. Some gardeners like the look of the dried blooms 
on their plants, and even consider it an extra form of winter protection for 
their flower buds. They clip off the spent blooms as the buds begin to emerge 
in the spring. Others find the spent flowers an eyesore and remove them as the 
flower color fades. Either option is fine, just be careful about how much stem 
is cut when you do deadhead. The earlier you prune them off, the longer the 
stem can be. The later you deadhead, make sure you are simply just removing the 
flower head with very little stem. You don&#146;t want to damage any flower 
buds which may have already formed.</p> 
<p><i>Hydrangea quercifolia</i>, the oak leaf hydrangea usually doesn&#146;t 
require as much pruning, provided it has ample room to grow. If pruning is 
needed, follow the same guidelines as for<i>H. macrophylla</i>.</p> 
<p><i>Hydrangea paniculata (</i>panicle hydrangea<i>)</i> and <i>H. arborescens
</i>(smooth hydrangea) require a totally different method of pruning and are 
both much more forgiving if pruning is not done at a certain time. Other than 
pruning when flower buds are opening, you really can&#146;t mess these up too 
easily. The panicle (PeeGee) hydrangea can be formed into a tree, with very 
little pruning other than shaping done each year before growth begins in the 
spring. It can be pruned hard if needed, but do so before it begins to leaf out 
in the spring.<i>H. arborescens</i> or the smooth hydrangea (Annabelle) may or 
may not be pruned hard before growth begins. The smooth hydrangea will produce 
much larger blooms if pruned hard each year, but many gardeners opt for smaller 
blooms on sturdier stems. Annabelle&#146;s branches often fall over under the 
weight of their blooms, especially after irrigation or a good rain. Pruning 
crossover branches and pruning for structure and support by cutting stems to a 
heading of 18 &#150; 24 inches can give you a sturdier branch to support the 
blooms, but even then you may need some additional plant supports to keep the 
branches upright.</p> 
<p>Today nurseries and garden centers carry a wide array of hydrangeas. Make 
sure you choose a variety that will suit your landscape needs, as well as the 
site. Most of them like some water, and most prefer a little protection from 
the hot afternoon sun&#151;especially in the south, but there are exceptions to 
every rule. With good choices, and correct timing with pruning, your hydrangeas 
can stop traffic every year when in bloom.</p>
