<p>How would you like it if I told you there was a way to eat pretty much 
anything and everything you wanted to eat and still maintain your health? Or 
better yet, what if I told you that you could eat pretty much anything and 
everything you wanted and even improve your health? Would you be interested? I 
figured as much.</p> 
<p>There is a way to reduce blood sugar, improve insulin sensitivity, reduce 
blood pressure, increase HDL levels, get rid of diabetes, live a lot longer, 
and still be able to lose a little weight. All without giving up the foods you 
love. And without having to eat those foods in tiny amounts. Sounds like a 
late-night infomercial gimmick, but it isn&rsquo;t.</p> 
<p>Before I get to the real nitty gritty of how such a thing can be done, 
let&rsquo;s look at a method that has been proven in countless research 
institutions to bring about all the above-mentioned good things. It&rsquo;s 
called caloric restriction.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>When researchers restrict the caloric intake of a group of lab animals to 
about 30 to 40 percent of that of their ad libitum (all they want to eat) fed 
counterparts, they find that the calorically restricted animals live 30 percent 
or so longer, don&rsquo;t develop cancers, diabetes, heart disease, or obesity. 
These calorically restricted (CR) animals have low blood sugar levels, low 
insulin levels, good insulin sensitivity, low blood pressure and are, in 
general, much healthier than the ad lib fed animals.</p> 
<p>Most of the work in caloric restriction has been done on rodents, but there 
is a long term study on Rhesus monkeys (17 years at this point) that appears to 
confirm the rodent data on longevity and health with CR in primates. There are 
no human longevity studies, but there are a number of human studies on CR and 
health that show that human subjects under CR conditions reduce blood sugar, 
improve insulin sensitivity, reduce blood pressure, etc., so it stands to 
reason that if humans reduced their caloric intake by 30-40 percent for their 
entire lives, they would also live longer.</p> 
<p>Caloric restriction is a terrific way to lose weight and get healthy; 
problem is, it&rsquo;s not much fun. When rats live out their little ratty 
lives calorically restricted in their cages they seem to show signs of 
depression and irritability. Primates do for sure. If primates don&rsquo;t get 
enough cholesterol, they can actually become violent. But, if you&rsquo;re 
willing to put up with a little irritability, hostility and depression, it 
might be worth cutting your calories by 30 percent for the rest of your long, 
healthy miserable life.</p> 
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t sound so cheery? You&rsquo;re not ready to sign up yet?</p> 
<p>Well, there is a better way.</p> 
<p>A number of different research teams have studied a method by which rodents 
can get all the health and longevity benefits of caloric restriction without 
calorically restricting. And the method has been studied in humans and seems to 
achieve the same health benefits and, if an old Spanish study can be believed, 
maybe even an increase in lifespan.</p> 
<p>What is this magic method?</p> 
<p>Intermittent fasting.</p> 
<p>In regular fasting one goes entirely without food, which is caloric 
restriction carried to the extreme. Going entirely without food in the short 
term leads to improvement in health, but also leads to an extremely short life 
unless the fast is aborted.</p> 
<p>Intermittent fasting (IF) is just as its name implies: a period of fasting 
alternated with a period of eating.</p> 
<p>But isn&rsquo;t that what we do anyway? We eat breakfast, then fast until 
lunch. Then, after lunch, we fast until supper. Then we fast all night. Uh, not 
exactly.</p> 
<p>In research settings animals that are intermittently fasted are fed every 
other day, so they eat whatever they want for a day, then they are denied food 
for a day. Interestingly, on feeding days most of the animals eat a almost 
double the amount that their ad lib fed mates do. Thus the IF animals eat about 
the same number of calories overall that the ad lib fed animals eat, but, and 
this is a huge &lsquo;but,&rsquo; the IF animals enjoy all the health 
advantages that the CR animals do, and, in fact, are even healthier than the CR 
animals.</p> 
<p>Like caloric restriction, intermittent fasting reduces oxidative stress, 
makes the animals more resistant to acute stress in general, reduces blood 
pressure, reduces blood sugar, improves insulin sensitivity, reduces the 
incidence of cancer, diabetes, and heart disease, and improves cognitive 
ability. But IF does even more. Animals that are intermittently fasted greatly 
increase the amount of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) relative to CR 
animals. CR animals don&rsquo;t produce much more BDNF than do ad libitum fed 
animals.</p> 
<p>What&rsquo;s BDNF? (The Wikipedia definition is actually pretty good)</p> 
<p>BDNF, as its name implies, is a substance that increases the growth of new 
nerve cells in the brain, but it does much more than that. BDNF is 
neuroprotective against stress and toxic insults to the brain and is 
somehow&ndash;no one yet knows how, exactly&ndash;involved in the insulin 
sensitivity/glucose regulating mechanism. Infusing BDNF into animals increases 
their insulin sensitivity and makes them lose weight. Humans with greater 
levels of BDNF have lower levels of depression. BDNF given to depressed humans 
reduces their depression. And Increased levels of BDNF improves cognitive 
ability. In short, you want as much BDNF as you can get., and with IF you can 
get a lot.</p> 
<p>But, who wants to go all day every other day without food?</p> 
<p>Well, you don&rsquo;t have to. MD and I, using ourselves (selflessly, I 
might add) as subjects have worked it out.</p> 
<p>Most rodents feed throughout the day and night, so restricting them for 24 
hours does just that: it restricts them for 24 hours. In humans, however, the 
situation is different. We humans, for the most part, eat only during our 
waking hours. So if we fast for a day, we end up fasting for about 34 hours and 
eating for 14, which isn&rsquo;t the same as 24 on, 24 off.</p> 
<p>Let me show you what I mean.</p> 
<p>Let&rsquo;s say you pick a day to start. You eat all day, then go to bed, 
wake up in the morning and fast all day, then go to bed. You wake up the next 
morning and eat all day, then go to bed and start again. So, assuming you eat 
until 10 PM on your eat day, once you quit eating you don&rsquo;t eat again 
until 8 AM 34 hours later. If you eat from 8 AM that day until 10 PM, 
you&rsquo;ve eaten for 14 hours. so, you&rsquo;re on (eating) for 14 hours and 
off (fasting) for 34. MD and I spent a couple of weeks doing it that way, and 
I&rsquo;m here to tell you, it&rsquo;s no fun. At least not on the fast days. 
The eating days were a different story; they were great, but we would spend the 
entire day dreading the fast day coming up.</p> 
<p>We fooled around with a number of different eat-fast-eat regimens and came 
up with something that works pretty well. We set up our cutoff time as 6 PM. On 
the day we started, we ate until 6 PM, then fasted until 6 PM the next day. On 
the next day we ate supper right after 6 PM and ate breakfast and lunch (and a 
few snacks) the next day until 6 PM when we started fasting again.</p> 
<p>The advantage of this regimen is that we were able to eat every day. One 
day we would get supper&ndash;the next day we would get breakfast and lunch. On 
no days would we go entirely without food. This schedule worked the best for us.
</p> 
<p>On the times during the day that we ate, we didn&rsquo;t stick with our 
normal low-carb fare; we ate pretty much whatever we wanted, including a fare 
amount of higher carb stuff. We stuck with the regimen for a few weeks just to 
see if we could tolerated it, which we did just fine. We ultimately drifted 
back to our normal low-carb diet, however, just because it seemed to work 
better with our schedules. We could have been happy on the intermittent fasting 
regimen for the long term.</p> 
<p>I would think that the optimal way to go would be to follow an intermittent 
fast using low-carb foods during the eating periods. One would get the best of 
all worlds healthwise this way.</p> 
<p>Over the period that we followed the various IF regimens we lost a little 
weight because, unlike the rodents, we couldn&rsquo;t eat twice as much during 
the eating days as we would have eaten were we not fasting. We didn&rsquo;t 
check any lab work to see if any values had changed. We weren&rsquo;t doing a 
hard core study; we were simply evaluating IF as a practical means for humans 
to use to improve their health.</p> 
<p>In thinking about the process I came to the conclusion that IF was probably 
the way Paleolithic man ate. We modern humans have become acculturated to the 
three square meals per day regimen. Animals in the wild, particularly 
carnivorous animals, don&rsquo;t eat thrice per day; they eat when they make a 
kill. I would imagine that Paleolithic man did the same. If I had to make an 
intelligent guess, I would say that Paleolithic man probably ate once per day 
or maybe even twice every three days. In data gathered from humans still living 
in non-Westernized cultures in the last century, it appears that they would 
gorge after a kill and sleep and lay around doing not much of anything for the 
next day or so. When these folks got hungry, they went out and hunted and 
started the cycle again.</p> 
<p>If you buy into the idea that the Paleolithic diet is the optimal diet for 
us today because it is the diet we were molded by the forces of natural 
selection to perform best on, then you should probably also buy into the idea 
that a meal timing schedule more like that of Paleolithic mean would provide 
benefit as well.</p> 
<p>One of the things MD and I took away from our IF experience is the idea 
that we don&rsquo;t have to eat three meals per day. We now often skip lunch 
and don&rsquo;t seem any the worse for it. Sometimes we get up and get going 
with all our projects and don&rsquo;t eat breakfast. We try to skip a meal here 
and there because figure it&rsquo;s probably good for us. When you get used to 
it, you don&rsquo;t really even think about it. And it&rsquo;s good for you. 
Don&rsquo;t take my word for it&ndash;look at the medical literature.</p> 
<p>There have been a few human studies on IF, and all have shown a marked 
improvement in virtually every parameter tested. None of the subjects in any of 
these studies has done the full 24 on-24 off that MD and I did. Most fasted 
until 5 or 6 PM on the fast days, then ate, then ate regularly on the eat days. 
Even with this wimpy IF schedule the subjects did better.</p> 
<p>One of the recent papers published on the less rigid IF schedules caught my 
eye because one of the authors was Don Laub, who used to be the chairman of the 
plastic surgery department at Stanford. When I was in medical school I thought 
I wanted to be a plastic surgeon so I went to Stanford during a part of my 
senior year and worked with Dr. Laub as my mentor.</p> 
<p>In this study, published in the journal <em>Medical Hypothesis</em> in 
March of this year, Dr. Laub along with two other physicians (neither of whom I 
know) underwent their version of and intermittent fast. The three of them have 
since May 2003 been on a version of the IF in which they consume about 20-50 
percent of their estimated daily energy requirements on the fast day and eat 
whatever they want on the non-fast days.</p> 
<p>Since starting their regimen they have</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>observed health benefits starting in as little as two weeks, in insulin 
resistance, asthma, seasonal allergies, infectious diseases of viral, bacterial 
and fungal origin (viral URI, recurrent bacterial tonsillitis, chronic 
sinusitis, periodontal disease), autoimmune disorder (rheumatoid arthritis), 
osteoarthritis, symptoms due to CNS inflammatory lesions (Tourette&rsquo;s, 
Meniere&rsquo;s) cardiac arrhythmias (PVCs, atrial fibrillation), menopause 
related hot flashes.</p> </blockquote> 
<p>In their paper these researchers discuss a 1957 paper from the Spanish 
medical literature.</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>&hellip;the subjects were eating, on alternate days, either 900 calories or 
2300 calories, averaging 1600, and that body weight was maintained. Thus they 
consumed either 56% or 144% of daily caloric requirement. The subjects were in 
a residence for old people, and all were in perfect health and over 65. Over 
three years, there were 6 deaths among 60 study subjects and 13 deaths among 60 
ad lib-fed controls, non-significant difference. Study subjects were in 
hospital 123 days, controls 219, highly significant difference. We believe 
widespread use of this pattern of eating could impact influenza epidemics and 
other communicable diseases by improving resistance to infection. In addition 
to the health effects, this pattern of eating has proven to be a good method of 
weight control, and we are continuing to study the process in conjunction with 
the NIH.</p> </blockquote> 
<p>There is much more to the IF story that I will continue in another post. I 
would do it in this one, but I (actually my web guy) upgraded my blogging 
software and somehow the little buttons that let me link to other sites are 
AWOL. I can&rsquo;t italicize or set off quotes or do any of the things I 
normally do in the course of posting. I&rsquo;m hoping that I will get this 
straightened out soon. When I do, I&rsquo;ll go into the subject in a little 
more detail and show a chart that demonstrates the difference between CR and 
IF. (Note: the problem is solved; all links are working.)</p> 
<p>In the meantime, if any of the readers of this blog would like to undertake 
an intermittent fast, I would love to hear the results of the experience.

<p>That&rsquo;s very interesting. Just yesterday it got to be close to 9:30 AM 
and I realized I had forgotten to eat breakfast (usually have it around 7). I 
went ahead and had some because I had a quiz coming up at 11 in a class 
I&rsquo;m taking and was worried if I didn&rsquo;t eat I wouldn&rsquo;t be able 
to concentrate. We are so strongly programmed to eat 3 times a day. But in the 
last few weeks there have been half a dozen or more times when I thought 
&ldquo;do I really have to eat?&rdquo; or have nearly forgotten it&rsquo;s time 
for a meal. I&rsquo;ll think about giving IF a try. &ndash;Anne</p> 
<p>Hi Anne&ndash;</p> 
<p>I&rsquo;ve often noticed the same thing: I&rsquo;m not particularly hungry 
yet I eat just because it&rsquo;s time to eat. If I had to go out and run some 
game to earth, would I be hungry enough to do so? I doubt it.</p> 
<p>Good luck on your IF. Keep me posted.</p>

<p>OK Mike &ndash; I didn&rsquo;t expect to read this one this morning. So a 
couple of questions spring to mind&hellip;</p> 
<p>1. How might IF affect muscle mass? If you are not getting your BCAAs from 
your food your body will cannibalize itself for the stuff. How long CAN a 
person refrain from protein and not sacrifice what you have? Any data on this? 
I feel if I undertook an IF regimen I&rsquo;d lose lean tissue. I certainly 
don&rsquo;t think an IF diet is conducive to anabolism but hey&hellip;</p> 
<p>2. Are not these IF studies done on unhealthy, overfat subjects? I can 
easily see why IF would help overfat and out of shape Mary Smith or Junk food 
gorging Joe Anderson, but taking me for example, someone with near perfect 
internal health markers and bodyfat composition for a 45 year young male, could 
IF be detrimental?</p> 
<p>Thanks Mike! And BTW my blog address is http://www.slowburn.typepad.com</p> 
<p>Hi Fred&ndash;</p> 
<p>I don&rsquo;t think IF would affect muscle mass much at all. If you go 
without food for a long period of time, say, several days, your metabolic 
system goes after your muscle mass to convert the protein stored there into the 
glucose you need to keep your blood glucose normal. This doesn&rsquo;t happen 
in the short term. All the protein structures in the body draw from and add to 
the amino acid pool. When muscle breaks down the individual amino acids go into 
the pool from where they&rsquo;re harvested by the system that converts them to 
glucose. When new muscle is made, the amino acids used to construct the muscle 
protein are drawn from the amino acid pool. One of the contributors to the AA 
pool is enzymes that are no longer needed and junk proteins that the body is 
cleansing from the cells. When one is fasting, one of the group of enzymes not 
really needed is the group of digestive enzymes that would otherwise be 
employed in digesting food. These enzymes break down and their amino acids 
enter the AA pool where the muscle can pick them up as needed. Also, during an 
IF, the body goes into ketosis. I posted a few months back on how ketosis 
stimulates the process of cellular cleansing by removing junk proteins from the 
cells. The amino acids from these proteins also enter the AA pool where they 
can be recycled by the muscle mass. So, even though new protein isn&rsquo;t 
coming into the body minute by minute from the diet, there is plenty of 
substrate there in the AA pool to last until the next meal, which is, at most, 
only 24 hours away.</p> 
<p>Second, although many of these studies were done using unhealthy subjects, 
a number were performed on people, both healthy and unhealthy, who were fasting 
for religious reasons. In all cases all healthy parameters evaluated improved.

<p>IF will not effect muscle mass. It takes about 3 days before your body will 
eat its on muscle for energy. You may appear a bit flatter which will make you 
believe you are losing muscle during IF this is water loss and will be 
replenished on feed days giving you a pumped and vascular look if you are 
already lean the results will be even greater.</p> Reply <br>

<p>I can attest, Mike, it does work, exactly as you said. I don&rsquo;t do the 
day on, day off &mdash; I found that a bit too disruptive. For close to a year, 
I&rsquo;ve eaten just once a day, usually something like a meal and a half 
between 6-8 pm, fully low-carb, and eating nothing the rest of the time. 
Benefits are as you mentioned &mdash; nuisance health issues go away, zero 
colds/flu, weight dropped to a comfortable lean zone, and oddly, energy 
actually INCREASES during the non-eating time. Sure, I get stomach-grumbling 
hungry late in the day, but it&rsquo;s easy to take, since I know I&rsquo;ll be 
eating later. (Oddly, the feeling isn&rsquo;t all that unpleasant after a while 
&mdash; somehow makes you feel more alive and tuned.)</p> 
<p>I notice coming up on dinner time, I actually get a surge of energy and 
almost fidgetiness, which I sometimes need to burn off with some exercise. 
(Which is, I suppose, how Paleo man had the energy to make a kill, even when he 
hadn&rsquo;t eaten in a while.)</p> 
<p>I know Loren Cordain seemed to be intrigued by the idea of once-a-day meal 
frequency, as he covered in one of his recent newsletters.</p> 
<p>There&rsquo;s clearly some value to going long(er) periods without food 
&mdash; some sort of metabolic grooving or run-out that the body seems to love. 
Grazing never worked like that for me.</p> 
<p>There&rsquo;s also a huge psychological benefit here, too: Every day has a 
great ending. Something you can look forward to.</p> 
<p>After the day&rsquo;s labors, you get to sit down to a &lsquo;feast&rsquo; 
of sorts, and loll about in delicious laziness afterword, guilt-free. 
There&rsquo;s a more natural biological rhythm to that, at least for me.</p> 
<p>Also, you get to experience the exquisite pleasure of eating well, when 
you&rsquo;re truly deep-down hollow hungry. Which we hardly ever experience any 
more.</p> 
<p>Hi Walt&ndash;</p> 
<p>You&rsquo;re right on all counts. The hunger is exquisite and the food much 
more tasty and fulfilling after waiting for it for a while and really looking 
forward to it. Most of us don&rsquo;t experience real hunger anymore; we just 
think we do.</p> 
<p>The French don&rsquo;t like to snack between meals because they feel that 
the snack diminishes their hunger and prevents them from fully experiencing the 
meal. I think they&rsquo;re right.</p> 
<p>Loren Cordain and I have had many, many conversations about meal timing. I 
got him started on the idea a couple of years back. He, too, believes it is the 
Paleolithic way and that meal timing could be equal in importance to meal 
composition.</p>

<p>Is it me, or is about everyone in the Paleo movement ripping Ori 
Hofmekler/Warrior Diet off&hellip;</p> 
<p>I gotta say Mike your post was almost verbatim Warriior Diet.. heck, the 
whole IF upstart of recent is on the heels of Ori/Warrior Diet, which has been 
out for 6+ years&hellip;</p> 
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t have no much problem with it, esp. among professionals 
like you who seem to be coasting on a bit of sucess from others, would give 
Hofmekler his due credit when these discussions/debates/postings come

<p>I don&rsquo;t see how this looks like the Warrior Diet. Someone above 
posted they were doing what looks like the Warrior Diet. Don&rsquo;t eat all 
day and have just one big meal. Mike was alternating days not eating. One day

<p>WAltk,<br>
 What you did is called restricted feeding, and has a slightly 
different mechanism&hellip; you were &ldquo;lucky&rdquo; because as long as I 
understand, Restricted Feeding only works like IF when the eating is doing 
almost in the night time, because cheats the circadian rhythm of your body and 
&ldquo;reset&rdquo; the cycle, so it could be adjusted to the feeding pattern, 
without de-synchronize the clock of your organs and tissues and the clock of 
hypothalamus.</p> 
<p>I might add, that the IF system that Mike made up, might be a combination 
of both&hellip;<br>

<p>Oh, and on CR:</p> 
<p>Mike, I always wondered about energy expenditure among the CRers. If 
you&rsquo;re only eating, say 1600 calories per day, you can only be burning 
1600 (if you&rsquo;re weight-stable).</p> 
<p>Which means, you can&rsquo;t be very physically active; no one-on-one 
basketball in the driveway, no running. Not too many workouts with weights.</p> 
<p>I&rsquo;m guessing CR&rsquo;d animals and humans tend to get a bit quiet 
and sedate &mdash; and miss the benefits of vigorous exercise. Unless of 
course, CR makes up for it in some way.</p> 
<p>(Didn&rsquo;t mean to monopolize.)</p> 
<p>No problem. I don&rsquo;t remember if any of the CR studies discuss the 
activity levels of the animals. I&rsquo;ll go back and check. I wouldn&rsquo;t 
bet my life on it, but it seems like the CR ones were actually a little more 
active.</p>

<p>This article sounds much like something Art Devany would recommend. He is 
writing a book called Evolutionary Fitness, training and eating like a human 
did hundreds of years ago. Fasting is part of the regime. He has a website,
http://www.arthurdevany.com/. Your take on food is very similar to his.<br>
 My 
wife and I embarked on a fasting program just a few weeks ago, going without 
food for a good part of the day, and then eating dinner. We do use juice (have 
a juicer), maybe a glass or two of a vegetable or fruit juice, with lots of 
water, no coffee. So far we find that we feel a bit ill while we detox, but 
feel better overall after a day or two. One other note, eating only when hungry 
is the way to go. How many people are &ldquo;programmed&rdquo; to eat at work 
breaks or social events (where the food is usually bad) because that&rsquo;s 
what you do? If you are not hungry, don&rsquo;t eat!</p> 
<p>Hi Audley&ndash;</p> 
<p>Well said. If you&rsquo;re not hungry, don&rsquo;t eat. Seems pretty 
simple, but it&rsquo;s amazing how many people eat at set times whether hungry 
or not.</p>

<p>There is a diet that uses IF: The Warrior Diet. Its not alternate day 
fasting however. One basically confines all their eating to a 4 hour window, so 
you&rsquo;re fasting 20 hours/day or so.</p> 
<p>The author is not a fan of low carb per se, but is a big advocate of whole 
foods, etc.</p> 
<p>Hi VikingDan&ndash;</p> 
<p>Some time in my dim and distant past I think I read The Warrior Diet. 
Wasn&rsquo;t it written by an Israeli commando guy? If I remember correctly, he 
did bad mouth low carb, but recommended eating a big meal once per day as he 
believed the warriors of times past had done.</p> 
<p>The nice thing about IF is that one can get the benefits from it without 
sticking to a strict low-carb diet, although I suspect it works even better 
with a low-carb diet.</p>

<p>This sounds really interesting, and I think I might give it a try. </p> 
<p>What was your experience with exercise while you did your experiment, and 
with your current intermittent meal skipping? I would guess it would still be 
workable, depending on how you schedule your workouts.</p> 
<p>Cathy</p> 
<p>Hi Cathy&ndash;</p> 
<p>I didn&rsquo;t change my workout schedule at all. It didn&rsquo;t seem to 
make a big difference when I worked out relative to when I was fasting.</p> 
<p>The scheduling problem we did have was with social engagements. If we were 
invited to a dinner somewhere that was set for an evening when we were supposed 
to be fasting, we simply moved our time to start fasting until after the 
dinner. For example, if we were supposed to start fasting at 6 PM as per our 
regular schedule but instead had a dinner engagement that evening fat 7:30 PM, 
we ate the dinner, started fasting at 8:30 (or whenever the dinner was over) 
and fasted until 8:30 the next evening. Then we ate from 8:30 PM until 6 PM the 
next evening and got back on schedule.</p>

<p>Wow. This post sounds great. I haven&rsquo;t read the whole thing but 
definitely will. I am aware of some of the research on calorie restriction 
diets and I think it&rsquo;s all quite fascinating. I would include exercise as 
another way to induce a sort of caloric restriction as well.</p>

<p>don&rsquo;t you get unbearably hungry during the fasting periods? I 
couldn&rsquo;t imagine getting thru a day at work without any breakfast or 
lunch, and I have a fairly low stress job.</p> 
<p>anyway, if I did try this, I imagine I would try it with a low carb diet, 
why not have the best of both worlds?</p> 
<p>Hi mrfreddy&ndash;</p> 
<p>Surprisingly, you don&rsquo;t really get all that hungry during the day. 
And it&rsquo;s nice to know that a big, fat juicy meal is awaiting you at 6 PM.

<p>Yep, you&rsquo;ll be really hungry the first time you try IF. However, each 
time you do it you will feel hunger later in your fast and less intensely.</p> 
<p>I have done several 36-hour fasts this year. I&rsquo;m not a true IFer, but 
I try to do a 36 hour fast once a week (sometimes twice). I have found that 
each one is a little easier than the previous one.</p> 
<p>Now my desire for food when I fast is more taste-based. It is kind of 
ikelike wanting some desert after having a meal. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not really 
hungry, but I REALLY want some mango. &rdquo;</p> 
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe that this is because I&rsquo;ve built up more will 
power. (Maybe that accounts for a little bit of the lack of hunger.)</p> 
<p>My paradigm is that even the thinnest of us have a lot of fat and other 
tissue that can be converted into energy. However, the enzymes and other 
resources necessary to convert those potential energy sources need to be built 
up or we will experience hunger long before those reserves are used up.</p> 
<p>When you fast regularly, you build up your ability to convert fats into 
energy (and in so doing get rid of the toxins that are stored with the fats, 
you also generate growth hormone, resveratrol and BDNF).</p> 
<p>It is sort of like what would happen if we decided to move away from 
gasoline to some other fuel. Even if that fuel was abundant, we would still 
experience &ldquo;hunger&rdquo; until we built enough refineries that could 
convert that new fuel into a usable form.</p> Reply <br>

<p>I could just weep. I would often do this naturally as a child&ndash;or I 
should say, I would try, and then get disciplined by my parents.<br>
 I think 
that many parents, working with the bad cultural info that&rsquo;s available, 
often completely screw up their children&rsquo;s instincts. Of course, 
it&rsquo;s done out of concern and love, which makes it so sad.<br>
 If you 
have read anything on the history of childrearing customs throughout the past 
few centuries in Western cultures, you know it&rsquo;s been pretty appalling 
anyway.<br>
 When I look back on what was required of me and many of my 
childhood friends I can understand why so many of us have ended up obese.<br>
 
I think I will try the IF starting today. I&rsquo;ve had my rare steak for 
breakfast, so I will eat till 6 pm tonight, and then start after 6 pm tomorrow.
<br> A few questions &mdash; do coffee and tea count as food, or must it be 
strictly water&ndash;could club soda be used on the fast? Does this change at 
all how any exercise is scheduled? What about supplements on the morning of the 
fast? I&rsquo;m assuming that very low carb can still be used on eating days, I 
can just have more of whatever it is I&rsquo;m eating.</p> 
<p>Hi LCforevah&ndash;</p> 
<p>I&rsquo;m in total agreement with you about the child rearing issues. How 
many of us have been told that we couldn&rsquo;t do this or that or 
couldn&rsquo;t leave the table until we cleaned up our plate, that children in 
China were starving, etc. Kids, before this kind of programming, eat when 
they&rsquo;re hungry. It is kind of sad that the adults in their lives try to 
break them of their natural instinct.</p> 
<p>As to your questions&hellip;</p> 
<p>No, coffee, tea, diet drinks, etc. don&rsquo;t count. At least they 
didn&rsquo;t for us. I would drink away.</p> 
<p>We didn&rsquo;t change our exercise schedules, so I don&rsquo;t really have 
a recommendation there. It didn&rsquo;t seem to matter to us.</p> 
<p>We did take our supplements on fasting days, we just took them during the 
period during the day when we were eating, i.e., before 6 PM or after 6 PM 
depending on the day.</p> 
<p>You can indeed follow low-carb during the eating periods and eat all you 
want. The dinner meal at 6 PM is wonderful.</p> 
<p>Best of luck on the IF regimen. Keep me posted; I&rsquo;m really interested 
to hear how it works for you.</p>

<p>My day never feels quite complete without a Eades Blog update, so today is 
starting very well.</p> 
<p>This is very fascinating. I&rsquo;ve been reading quite a lot about CR 
since there is an avid, practicing CRON person posting on the low carb forum I 
frequent. One of his fellow CRONies has had good luck controling Lupus with the 
diet.</p> 
<p>Also, amongst ankylosing spondylitis patients I talk to (me being one) they 
sometimes use fasts to get out of a flare. Many also seem to have some luck 
with a No-Starch Diet. I&rsquo;ll have to post a link to your article on 
kickas.org message forum and perhaps the IF might be something that could help.
</p> 
<p>Considering the enormous amount of Pad Thai I had last night&hellip; I 
should IF today.</p> 
<p>Hi Nancy&ndash;</p> 
<p>Thanks for the nice words about the blog; I really appreciate it. 
I&rsquo;ll try to be more diligent in my posting, so that more of your days 
will be complete.</p> 
<p>There exists a fair amount of data that low-starch diets (and low-carb 
diets) work to prevent flare ups of all kinds of autoimmune disorders. Fasting 
itself gives the GI tract time to heal. It helps the healing process, whether 
fasting or not, to take 4-10 grams of l-glutamine per day.</p> 
<p>If you do decide to give IF a try, be sure to let me know how it works for 
you.</p>

<p>You might already know that twice-a-week IF is the norm for (traditional) 
Orthodox Christians. The Wed &amp; Fri fasts start after dinner on Tue or Thu 
&ndash; and no meals are eaten until after 3 pm on Wed &amp; Fri &ndash; and 
those are one or two small, vegan-no-oil meals. And of course, nothing by mouth 
after dinner on Saturday until after Liturgy on Sunday &ndash; usually around 
noon.</p> 
<p>this is year-round &ndash; there are of course other times when the 
vegan-no-oil diet is followed for up to 40 days at a time (Great Lent, Nativity 
Fast, etc).</p> 
<p>Hi Lisa&ndash;</p> 
<p>Many religions have incorporated fasting for various lengths into their 
customs. A number of scientific articles have been generated from data 
collected from religious groups undertaking these fasts. In all cases (at least 
all the studies I&rsquo;ve read) most health parameters improved during the 
fasting period.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m very interested &mdash; excited, even &mdash; about this! This is 
the way I used to eat back when I was a student. (Way too many years ago.) It 
was the way I felt best and had the best energy to meet all the demands of 
working full time, going to school, hiking all over campus, etc. I had 
discovered it was the best way to avoid hypoglycemia problems &mdash; no 
problem at all if I just ate once a day, at dinner. It was also very 
convenient. It&rsquo;s amazing how much time and effort goes into planning our 
next feed! Much easier if it&rsquo;s just once a day.</p> 
<p>Eventually over the years I have succumbed to all advice that not eating 
several times a day could cause weight gain (starvation mode, etc.). Even 
though that really doesn&rsquo;t make sense if you think it&rsquo;s at all wise 
to try to eat like our ancestors.</p> 
<p>Yesterday I exercised after not having eaten for quite a while &mdash; and 
felt much stronger than usual.</p> 
<p>Hmmmmm&hellip;. I think I&rsquo;ll try my old eating schedule. Do you think 
black coffee would mess up the fasting times?</p> 
<p>Hi PeggyJo&ndash;</p> 
<p>No, black coffee won&rsquo;t mess it up. Go for it. I had black coffee 
throughout the entire time I was fasting. Same holds for tea or any other

<p>hmmmm, this sounds very familiar to how the Hellers started their

<p>I believe it was Mrs Heller that would fast until evening and then allow

the Carb Addict revolution began&hellip;.so IF in another incarnation, eat once

<p>Hi Deb&ndash;</p> 
<p>Actually followers of the Carbohydrate Addicts Diet ate very low carb 
throughout the day, then had a &lsquo;reward meal&rsquo; at night, which was, 
basically, as much food as they could cram in their mouths over a one hour 
period. Since these folks were eating all day, they weren&rsquo;t really on an 
IF.</p>

<p>I do remember Mrs. Heller writing her story about how the diet came about 
just as the above poster mentioned. She had some medical tests that required 
fasting, and did not eat all day then ate a huge meal at night. She lost 2 
pounds so did the same thing the next&hellip;and the next. She lost 150 pounds. 
SHE was fasting&hellip;.but the diet does not require you to.</p>

<p>Another great blog entry Michael. Thanks..<br>
 Like some others mentioned, 
I used to eat like this all the time. However, back then I would eat only once 
or twice every day and overeat on carbs. Lowering carbs would have made a world 
of difference.</p> 
<p>I had pretty decent results with a PSMF-like approach and eating only 1000 
kcals one day and overeating another day. However, my workouts would always be 
scheduled on the overeating days.<br>
 Back then I hadn&rsquo;t thought of 
IF-regimen and tried to stick to 4-5 meals/day in the bb-fashion. This method 
would be tons easier.</p> 
<p>The method seemed a bit confusing at first. To summarize :<br>
 day 1 : eat 
bf &amp; lunch = eat before 6 pm<br>
 day 2: eat dinner = start eating after 6 
pm<br>
 day 3: eat bf &amp; lunch = eat before 6 pm<br>
 day 4: like day 
2&hellip; rinse &amp; repeat.<br>
 basically dinner-lunch-bf / &ndash; -

<p>I&rsquo;m trying to integrate this into my thinking and have a few 
questions.</p> 
<p>I&rsquo;ve been reading Dr. Berstein&rsquo;s &ldquo;Diabetes 
Solution&rdquo; book and he talks about how overeating, even no carb food, can 
cause the body to release excess insulin and glucagon, due to the upper small 
intestine getting stretched. This makes sense from a paleo POV, since you would 
want to put on some fat every time you ate, even if you were gorging on 
mastadon meat.</p> 
<p>It seems like gorging one day and then fasting the next would play havoc 
with BG over time in a modern world, where we can&rsquo;t loll about after 
gorging ourselves. Could you not get a similar effect by eating small amounts 
ONLY when physically hungry?</p> 
<p>I&rsquo;ve lost weight in the past (and am losing some more now) this way. 
I eat enough to not be hungry and make sure I don&rsquo;t stretch my stomach. 
If I&rsquo;m only hungry once during the day, I only eat once. If I&rsquo;m 
working hard, I may be hungry 4-5 times a day.</p> 
<p>It seems like that would give you similar results without the insulin 
response. My blood pressure has gone down a lot since I started eating this way 
and my fasting BG has gone down (I&rsquo;m not diabetic; I just monitor it). My 
BG has been very stable too.</p> 
<p>What do you think?</p> 
<p>BTW, food tastes MUCH better when you are physically hungry. You can even 
tell when you start to cross over into overeating, because the food starts to 
change flavor. You, of course, have to pay attention and not read or watch TV 
while eating.</p> 
<p>Thanks for the great blog!</p> 
<p>Hi Ryan&ndash;</p> 
<p>The &lsquo;stretch&rsquo; reflex could conceivably cause a problem, but in 
all the studies I&rsquo;ve read, glucose levels and insulin sensitivity 
improve. Apparently something corrective happens during the 24 hours in which 
one isn&rsquo;t eating.</p> 
<p>If you are a type II diabetic I would be most interested in learning how an 
If regimen works for you.</p>

<p>OK, the health benefits seem to be a given. My practical mind jumps to 
other, non-health related pluses. This would have to have a positive impact on 
the grocery bill as I doubt you would eat twice as much on non fasting days. If 
you aren&rsquo;t restricting carbs as much, you could also eat more of cheaper 
higher carb veggies and whole grains. I love the idea of only having to do food 
prep and kitchen clean up every 2nd day. Think of what other worthwhile 
activities could take up that time!<br>
 Back to the health issues, after 3 
years low carb, DH has much improved his health parameters, but would really 
like to get the weight and blood pressure down just a little more. Maybe this 
will do the trick, if I can convince him to give it a try.</p> 
<p>Hi Sue&ndash;</p> 
<p>I hadn&rsquo;t considered the other virtues of every other day eating such 
as only having to clean the kitchen half as much.</p>

<p>Hi Dr. Eades,</p> 
<p>Gotta totally agree with you on this one. I&rsquo;m on a zero carb diet 
(only eating from the animal kingdom, no veggies, starches, sugars, low-carb 
products, etc.) and I often go extended periods without anything to eat, 
without even tying really, especially if I happen to be busy. I&rsquo;ve easily 
gone 24 hours without eating, up to 36 hours as well and I could easily go 
48hrs if need be.</p> 
<p>There&rsquo;s only one reason to be hungry and that&rsquo;s because of 
carbs in the diet and it&rsquo;s fluctuations in your blood sugar, even minimal 
ones. No carbs=steady blood sugar levels=no hunger.</p> 
<p>Hi Rob&ndash;</p> 
<p>I think you&rsquo;re right on the money. People who have never been on such 
a regimen don&rsquo;t believe how unhungry they really are when they 
don&rsquo;t eat carbs.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been really interested in this for quite some time. And I do 
believe there is a recent study done on humans over a 1 month period where they 
were fasted every other day, for the entire day and was shown to be beneficial 
healthwise though they didn&rsquo;t get over the discomfort and crankiness on 
fasting days. At work now, see if I can pull it up later.</p> 
<p>What about for someone that is into bodybuilding and maintaining or 
building an above average amount of muscle. Some research shows that a fairly 
steady supply of aminos need to be ingested regularly to build and/or maintain 
muscle while dieting. For example the fat police study showed that casein was 
better than whey, since casein was slower digested than whey, keeping a steady 
level of blood amino acids. The casein group lost more fat and built more 
muscle than the whey group because of this. Another study on boxers eating 2 
vs. 6 meals a day showed more muscle maintenance on 6 meals, although protein 
intake was abysmally low and the study had some shortcomings, such as a poor 
measure of body comp.</p>

<p>Hi Dr. Eades,</p> 
<p>When I was younger (high school age), I naturally did a sort of IF. I would 
go to school without breakfast, not eat lunch, and then gorge myself silly from 
3-5PM when I came home. After that I was usually too busy with 
homework/activities to eat again before bed, so this cycle amounted to eating 
once a day. I have to say that during this period I was very slim, had good 
energy, no teenage acne, etc. My senior year I began eating lunch during the 
day and immediately gained weight and developed some acne.</p> 
<p>I would be very interested in starting an IF regimen again, and have 
actually been toying with the idea for some time&hellip;I studied anthropology 
in college, so have been aware of IF for a few years now. The only obstacle is 
convincing my husband that I&rsquo;m not crazy.</p> 
<p>Thanks for all your insightful commentary on this post and others. If I do 
start IF I will take notes to share.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m so hard to convince sometimes and I admit that it sounds 
intriguing. Now, I may have missed it but what about water? Even if paleo-men 
didn&rsquo;t have anything to eat and were &lsquo;forced&rsquo; to fast 
intermittently, are we to also assume that they didn&rsquo;t visit a water hole 
at all during their &lsquo;no-eating&rsquo; periods? Or maybe we are also like 
animals that hibernate (bears come to mind), which don&rsquo;t really need 
water since it&rsquo;s produced from continuous fat oxidation.</p> 
<p>Just as a side note, a few years back there was a scientist that showed 
that he could extend the lifespan of the fruit fly up to 20 generations or so. 
Yeah, I know&hellip; flies aren&rsquo;t men&hellip; but neither are rodents! 
Caloric restriction wasn&rsquo;t what cause such extension of lifespan. 
Amazingly, at least in the case of the flies, what made them &lsquo;not 
die&rsquo; was the removal of their eggs right after the females laid them. It 
seemed that the only purpose in the flies&rsquo; life was to procreate and 
preserve their kind. So, no eggs, no progeny&hellip; bad idea to die! The 
scientist then noticed that once they left the eggs, the flies actually died 
when they were expected too.</p> 
<p>Although seemingly unrelated, I always remember this account when reading 
about life extension&hellip; particularly because I still haven&rsquo;t seen 
studies in which caloric restriction added pieces to the telomeres (the tips of 
the human chromosome arms&hellip; I know you know these but for those who 
don&rsquo;t I offer this visual) or, which is after all where &lsquo;life 
span&rsquo; resides (of course in the genetic sense).</p> 
<p>Perhaps when the diet is modified in some way, for example by going back to 
what has worked for us humans for millennia, doesn&rsquo;t really expand 
anything in the true sense, but restores the rate at which we are suppose to 
age. It may sound just as semantics, but somehow, living longer and aging

<p>No, you didn&rsquo;t miss anything about water; I didn&rsquo;t mention it. 
When MD and I did our version of IF we drank water whenever we were thirsty and 
drank coffee and other non-caloric beverages as per our taste.</p> 
<p>I would like to see the fruit fly study you wrote about. I&rsquo;ve looked 
at a lot of longevity studies (including a lot using fruit flies) and 
I&rsquo;ve never seen that one. Are you sure it was 20 generations?</p>

<p>Hi Doctor,</p> 
<p>I enjoy reading your posts. I especially like how you picked apart Jane 
Brody&rsquo;s article.</p> 
<p>I tried IF for a few months earlier this year and I can attest to its 
efficacy. But I found it mentally unsustainable. I allowed myself weekends 
&ldquo;off&rdquo; but I still couldn&rsquo;t maintain Mon-Fri, eating only 
dinner.</p> 
<p>I&rsquo;m definitely going to give your schedule a try. I&rsquo;ve also 
jumped on the low-carb bandwagon, at least for lunch anyway. I can&rsquo;t 
convince my wife to let me go all the way for dinner too!</p> 
<p>Michael </p> 
<p>PS I did allow myself coffee with honey and cream during my fasting days. 
It didn&rsquo;t seem to adversely affect my weight loss, though I suspect the 
fat would come off a little quicker if I could stomach my coffee black.</p> 
<p>Hi Michael&ndash;</p> 
<p>I suspect that the IF regimen as we worked it out will be a lot more 
tolerable than the one meal per day IF that you did a while back. I would 
imagine that eating only once per day, everyday, would be a little tough.</p> 
<p>Good luck in bringing your wife around. Keep me posted.</p>

<p>Hi Mike,</p> 
<p>Interesting post! But a question . . . Somewhere in Protein Power you 
advise against skipping meals since fasting stimulates insulin. Doesn&rsquo;t 
that apply here as well?</p> 
<p>In general, the idea of doing Yom Kippur every other day is a little too 
post-dilettante for me. I would want more information on what are the benefits 
of IF beyond my current strategy of filling up my 50-60 gm/day carb allotment 
with nutrient dense vegetables and fruit.</p> 
<p>Hi Chuck&ndash;</p> 
<p>I would like to see the quote from Protein Power where we wrote that 
fasting stimulates the insulin response. If you can dig it up, send it my way. 
If I wrote it, I was wrong. Fasting definitely reduces insulin levels.</p> 
<p>As I say to anyone who asks, if you&rsquo;re doing fine on whatever regimen 
you are currently following, why change? I think going without food from time 
to time-whether it&rsquo;s every other day or once a week or so&ndash;is a good 
thing and provides health benefits.</p>

<p>i have read a lot about this and have always wanted to try it but because i 
have tended toward hypoglycemia, i have hesitated.</p> 
<p>my question is, if i should start to feel the manic ravenous crazy state 
that i can sometimes fall into, is it best to break the fast and try another 
day or gut it out. will the hypoglycemic body eventually adapt to the fasting. 
it sounds like this way of eating should eventually improve such a condition.
</p> 
<p>great article, the 6PM thing is genius, never occurred to me and makes it a 
lot easier. i will probably pick 8PM because i like to eat and watch my tv 
show. susan</p> 
<p>Hi Susan&ndash;</p> 
<p>I would probably try to gut it out until dinner on the fasting days. The 
hypoglycemic state should respond nicely. One of the most potent stimuli to 
feed is a rapid drop in blood sugar. If you&rsquo;re not eating, the body makes 
plenty of blood sugar keeping levels from falling rapidly. So, once you get 
started you should do okay.</p> 
<p>8 PM until 8 PM is fine if that works for you. I hope the TV show 
you&rsquo;re watching is Low Carb CookwoRx </p>

<p>I was thrilled to find this discussion and, as a Type 2, would be just as 
thrilled to see how IF would influence my BG readings. I&rsquo;ve been reading 
on fasting in general and I firmly believe that the human body has a tremendous 
capacity to heal if it is given the chance. However, I am constantly seeing 
admonitions against diabetics fasting.</p> 
<p>I have recently made quite a few lifestyle changes in an effort to get my 
BG under control, including a low carb diet, stopping smoking and exercise. I 
think I&rsquo;ll give all of these changes a chance to &ldquo;settle 
down&rdquo; and will make the IF routine my fourth challenge.</p>

<p>Mike its timely that you wrote this article. About three months ago I had a 
little Brain flash after reading about calorie restriction. Can&rsquo;t 
remember who wrote it but the suggestion was that calorie restriction itself 
might not be generating the health benefits but perhaps it was the fact that 
caloric restriction makes you hungry and the being hungry sets of beneficial 
processes. For the last two months I have avoided breakfast altogether (black 
coffee only) and eaten only a very small lunch. A few slices of cold meat and 
maybe a kiwi fruit.(the equivalent of plucking a few berries or nuts) In the 
evenings I graze constantly. I have felt more energetic, sleep better, and have 
more time in the morning! It occurred to met that in paleo times no one was 
mucking around in the morning preparing food. Hunters were up and away just at 
dawn to take advantage of that time of day when nocturnal feeders and day 
feeders were about at the same time, thus increasing the opportunity for a 
kill. Much the same way we modern hunters hunt game! Not rocket science really. 
It is logical that our ancestors ate in the evening after dark when there was 
little else to do other than sleep and well&hellip;..<br>

<p>Here in south eastern Mass. we have a wonderful family owned breakfast 
restaurant called &ldquo;Percy&rsquo;s.&rdquo; Yankee Magazine calls it 
&ldquo;Heaven on Earth,&rdquo; and I agree. As my wife and I are the only 
lowcarbers we keep Percy&rsquo;s a special occasion place. When we do go, we 
eat like the above mentioned Paleolithic hunters. We fill up on pancakes, 
omelet, corn beef hash, and it just goes on. We usually wont eat again until 
the next day, maybe a bit of cheese around 10pm. The next day, however, we are 
out of ketosis and we are constantly hungry, so keeping it lowcarb sounds right 
to me.</p> 
<p>I can&rsquo;t imagine going so long with out eating like on an IF plan. I 
LOVE eating lowcarb, I LOVE cooking lowcarb. I would miss eating like I would 
miss my wife if she was absent for 24 hours. IF might work, but I will gladly 
read about the results. Also, please post more often if you can. I can&rsquo;t

<p>Dr Eades, there&rsquo;s a little group of us who&rsquo;ve been toying with 
intermittent fasting for the past year or so, based on Dr Mattson&rsquo;s 
research and ideas.</p> 
<p>We generally eat either 1 large meal per day (usually Paleo), or compress 
all our meals into a 4-6 hour window.</p> 
<p>Certainly works&hellip;I didn&rsquo;t have any weight issues to begin with 
as I was already eating Paleo, but decided to start eating that way on a 6 week 
ICU rotation where we were severely understaffed (made life a lot easier). 
Despite already being lean, I became even leaner despite no longer having time 
for exercise, without losing any significant muscle mass.</p> 
<p>There&rsquo;s been a lot of discussion about the topic over the past year 
or so on the nutrition board athttp://www.crossfit.com. One of the main 
contributors, Rob Wolff from crossfit norcal has written a lot about this way 
of eating, and could certainly provide you with feedback based on his and many 
others&rsquo; experience. I think he may have even worked with Cordain at some 
point. DeVany has also beein toying with the idea, but he emphasizes random 
fasts much more, which would be more in line with his ideas on the benefits of 
power laws in energy and metabolism patterns.</p> 
<p>On an unrelated but similarly interesting issue, you were asked about 
whether cold water dips worked via the principle of hormesis (from your 
&ldquo;Cordain picnic&rdquo; post). There is in fact some evidence that they 
do. I have a paper that shows increased levels of superoxide dismutase, 
catalase, and glutathione peroxidase in cold water swimmers compared to 
controls. There&rsquo;s more out there, though in obscure and difficult to find 
papers. Let me know if you&rsquo;re interested, I think I have some of the 
articles hidden somewhere in my laptop.</p> 
<p>D</p> 
<p>PS: If you have any of the references about heat-shock proteins and 
cold-water dips, I&rsquo;d love to read them.</p> 
<p>Hi David&ndash;</p> 
<p>Glad to hear you&rsquo;ve been doing so well on the IF regimen; most people 
I&rsquo;ve encountered who have followed such a regimen really get into it and 
have the same experience you did.</p> 
<p>As to the hormesis issue&hellip;hormesis is the situation in which a small 
dose of something (usually toxic; radiation, for example) prevents an untoward 
response from a larger dose. Animals given small doses of gamma radiation are 
later protected against larger doses of gamma radiation, i.e., they don&rsquo;t 
develop cancers at as great a rate as those animals that weren&rsquo;t given 
the initial small dose.</p> 
<p>In terms of the cold water hormesis would mean that a small dose of cold 
water would protect one from the damaging effects of a prolonged stay in frigid 
water. I don&rsquo;t know if that&rsquo;s the case. What a sudden blast of cold 
water (or any extreme temperature change) does is increase the body&rsquo;s 
production of heat shock proteins, which act as chaperones in the development 
of new protein. Increasing heat shock protein levels increases the body&rsquo;s 
ability to deal with stress.</p> 
<p>I would indeed be interested in seeing the articles on cold water immersion 
and increased endogenous anti oxidant production.</p>

<p>I have to tell you a story. Back in College (SUNY Stony Brook, 
Anthropology), I worked as a baker, baking donuts for a chain donut shop. My 
schedule was erratic, as I&rsquo;d start work at 9 pm, work until 7 am, take a 
nap, commute to college in the afternoon, take another nap and so on. Around 
midnight, I&rsquo;d go snitch some portions of meat. Bacon, ham, tuna, roast 
Beef, whatever. I didn&rsquo;t realize it at the time, but I was eating very 
low carb. The fasting part occurred because if I thought I&rsquo;d gained some 
weight I wouldn&rsquo;t eat at all for one or two days.</p> 
<p>For five years, I kept myself at 105 pounds by doing this. Looked great, 
felt great. The only thing I ever consumed at campus was coffee.</p> 
<p>The funny thing is that if I succumbed to the temptation of a freshly fried 
doughnut, I was a mess for the rest of the night.</p> 
<p>One of my favorite (off topic) stories is when an elderly couple came into 
the shop and asked about the &ldquo;98% Fat Free&rdquo; doughnuts. They had 
&ldquo;a heart condition&rdquo;. I told them that the donuts are fried in 
partially hydrogenated vegetable oil, and at the time (1986?), I had learned 
from my bio professor (Dr. Bob Love, great professor) that partially 
hydrogenated fats were just as &lsquo;bad&rsquo; as saturated fats. That was 
the extent of the knowledge then, and I told them doughnuts were not good food. 
The couple left, and my boss popped up and told me he&rsquo;d fire me if I ever 
turned away a customer like that again.</p> 
<p>Now, after eating low carb for 2.5 years, I can honestly say that 
I&rsquo;ve gotten most of that eating pattern back. Maybe I&rsquo;ll have a can 
of sardines for brunch, but not much else until dinner. I am beginning to truly 
believe that Homo sapien sapien can exist on meat and fat alone.</p> 
<p>Hi Karen&ndash;</p> 
<p>Thanks for the stories of your life as a baker. I fear that I would have 
succumbed to the freshly baked donuts way more often than you did.</p> 
<p>Like you, I believe that we humans can do just fine (better than fine, 
actually) on a diet of meat and fat alone.</p>

<p>What about Vitamin C???</p> Reply <br>

<ul> 
<li>  mm, December 18, 2010 at 1:29 pm <br>
<br>

<p>The much-villainized and misunderstood uric acid is upregulated and 
replaces nearly all of vitamin C (ascorbic acid)&rsquo;s job when vitamin C is 
low, and very, very little vitamin C is lost on a no-carb, no-plant diet (some 
plants have a lot of vitamin C, but plant anti-nutrients and high carb intake 
depletes your vitamin C reserves quickly).</p> 
<p>The small amounts of vitamin C in muscle meat and liver, combined with 
increased uric acid secretion, seems to be adequate enough. Tribes like the 
Masai and Inuit have diets which are almost/completely devoid of plants, and 
yet they seem to be fine.<br>
 (funny thing is this also *might* be true of 
manganese, mostly found in plants but replaced by magnesium in cases of 
deficiencies&hellip; )</p> 
<p>We didn&rsquo;t evolve to not produce our own vitamin C and then survive 
millions of years of low/zero-carbing for no reason you know&hellip;<br>
 At 
worst, there are always supplements.</p> 
<p>Just don&rsquo;t eat high-carb &amp; low-vit.C at the same time; 
you&rsquo;ll get scurvy</p> Reply <br>

<p>Great post!</p> 
<p>I&rsquo;ve been Paleo for over a year, and I&rsquo;m a recent zero-carber. 
Since going carnivore, I&rsquo;ve found I naturally eat less often &ndash; 
usually brunch around noon and then dinner around 8 or 9. Prior to this I was 
eating (low-carb) every few hours to fight hypoglycemia, but since zero carb 
I&rsquo;ve had zero hypoglycemic symptoms, terrific energy, etc.</p> 
<p>Anyway, I&rsquo;m lucky enough to have a very flexible schedule, so 
I&rsquo;m thinking I could make this even easier by shifting the magic hour to 
2pm. That way on the &lsquo;eat after 2pm&rsquo; days, a decent sleep-in until 
noon would have that day not feel like a fast day at all, and on &lsquo;eat 
before 2pm&rsquo; days, breakfast and lunch would be eaten. I&rsquo;d still 
have to skip that dinner, but since I&rsquo;m already naturally lasting from 
noon til 8 or 9pm, eating at 2pm would probably see me through until I was 
asleep, dreaming about my 2pm brunch!</p> 
<p>If I try it, I&rsquo;ll let you know how it goes. : )</p>

<p>Hi Dr. Eades,<br>
 What about introducing more randomness to it? ie putting 
about 1-3 fasting days (no eating from 7am-7am) randomly into a week, or even 
just one fasting day randomly in a week? Another idea would be to do yours and 
MD&rsquo;s schedule randomly, ie 3 days on, 3 days off, 2 days on, 1 day off, 4 
days on, 5 days off, etc, etc. This sort of random eating pattern is something 
Art Devany is a big fan of, as it is likely most closely related to how our 
paleo ancestors ate.</p> 
<p>I think I will try that (especially if my wife agrees) and I&rsquo;ll let 
you know how it goes. I&rsquo;ve never skipped more than one meal in my whole 
life. I&rsquo;m an avid exerciser and can have about 4% body fat, carbs or no 
carbs, without a whole lot of effort, so I&rsquo;ve always been a little afraid 
not to eat.</p> 
<p>Anways, we&rsquo;ll see how it goes&hellip;.By the way, I&rsquo;m glad to 
have read some of the above posts. I have a three year old, and have been known 
to do the old &ldquo;You can get down from the table after you finish 
eating&rdquo; thing before. It&rsquo;s tough, if there ever was a wannabe 
vegan, it&rsquo;s him. He&rsquo;d prefer to just eat mango 3 times a day.</p> 
<p>Daniel</p> 
<p>Hi Daniel&ndash;</p> 
<p>I don&rsquo;t see any reason that the random approach wouldn&rsquo;t work. 
In fact, it probably is more in keeping with our Paleolithic past.</p> 
<p>Let me know how you do. And don&rsquo;t worry about you&rsquo;re kid. I did 
the old &ldquo;you can&rsquo;t leave until you&rsquo;ve cleaned your 
plate&rdquo; myself and they don&rsquo;t seem to be any the worse for wear. 
I&rsquo;m going to revise my stance with the grandchildren, however.</p>

<p>Thanks for the insightful blog post Dr Eades</p> 
<p>I eat only one low carb meal during the day during the week. On weekends I 
eat both days low carb.</p> 
<p>I have been doing this on and off for a few years and whenever I do, I lose 
weight and I have more energy (in fact, I did the &lsquo;eat one meal a 
day&rsquo; regimen eating non low carb a few years ago and also lost weight and 
had more energy).</p> 
<p>Unfortunately I haven&rsquo;t noticed that it has an effect on my eczema 
(which is rather chronic). I am curious to know if there low carb foods that I 
should avoid to lessen inflammation? I eat mostly meats, fish, eggs, spinach, 
broccoli and cauliflower. Cheese, cream and milk are present but not in huge 
quantities.</p> 
<p>Hi Sam&ndash;</p> 
<p>Glad to hear that you&rsquo;ve done well on the IF regimen.</p> 
<p>As to the eczema&hellip;I&rsquo;ve read a couple of studies in which 
researchers have put people with allergic problems on a diet of meat only for a 
while. You might want to try that for a week or so to see if the eczema gets 
better. If it does, then start adding one food at a time back in until you get 
a flare up and you will know what caused it. If going on the full meat diet 
doesn&rsquo;t help, then you&rsquo;ve probably got an eczema of non-allergic 
origin.</p>

<p>Dr. Eades, this subject more than any other in your blog has piqued my 
interest. I&rsquo;m going to show it to my husband and let him read it and see 
how he feels about partaking of this regimen. It really sounds doable. You 
mentioned that drinking water, coffee, et al is OK during the IF regimen, but 
what&rsquo;s you&rsquo;re opinion if one were to partake of whey protein 
drinks/shakes during the fast part of the schedule? Would this be considered a 
meal or as a liquid? Would drinking a protein shake during the fasting portion 
(say, during the BF or Lunch) defeat the whole purpose of this exercise?</p> 
<p>Hi Marlene&ndash;</p> 
<p>The only things you can eat (or drink) during the fast portion of the day 
are food without caloric content. If you eat calories, whether they be from 
whey or anything else, you really aren&rsquo;t on a fast; you would be 
following a low calorie diet. What apparently makes this regimen work is the 
period of time one goes without food. Adding a little food during those periods 
would defeat the purpose.</p>

<p>Perhaps I missed it.<br>
 I know you mentioned coffee as a beverage, and 
realize, if I remember reading correctly (previously) that you don&rsquo;t 
eliminate caffeine, so I am wondering if a person could make a beverage by 
freezing coffee in ice cube trays, and then shredding it in a blender &ndash; 
having a sort of iced coffee/frappichino (sp?) effect, with no particularly 
adverse consequences. This, of course, would still involve it remaining black, 
unsweetened, but would give variety.</p> 
<p>I guess perhaps the question should be more directed to temperature &ndash; 
is there a benefit to hot or cold, or is it a personal preference?</p> 
<p>Hi Constance&ndash;</p> 
<p>I think the hot or cold is a personal preference. If there are no calories 
it doesn&rsquo;t matter if it&rsquo;s boiling hot or freezing cold.</p>

blog, have decided to give IF a try. Some of us have already posted comments 
here. We started a support thread (
http://forum.lowcarber.org/showthread.php?t=309675&amp;page=1&amp;pp=15), where 
you or anyone else interested, can follow our progress, if you are so inclined.

<p>I lost 85 of 100 lbs using a variant of the techniques outlined here. 
(I&rsquo;m 5&rsquo;10&Prime;)</p> 
<p>Basically, I controlled caloric intake so each day was +/-200 calories of a 
1200 calorie baseline. (ie, Day 1 = 1200 cal, Day 2 = 1000 cal, Day 3 = 1400 
cal.) I went from 255 lbs to 170 lbs over a 1.5 year timespan w/a slight 
increase in exercise. The loss occurred between age 17 and 19. I&rsquo;m now 
age 52 and my weight has varied +/- 5 lbs over that period until recently. (I 
lost another 15 lbs switching to a lower carb regime over the last 2 years due 
to IGT dx. Total loss is 100 lbs.)</p> 
<p>I&rsquo;ve been accepted to the National Weightloss Registry and am happily 
filling out a whole bunch of surveys. </p> 
<p>Hi Steve&ndash;</p> 
<p>Make sure to tell the bozos at the National Weightloss Registry that your 
maintaining on a low-carb diet. They&rsquo;ll hate it.</p>

<p>Dr. Eades,</p> 
<p>Art Devany has mentioned several times that 15 hours with no food is all it 
takes to get the benefits of intermittent fasting. I&rsquo;ve looked but 
can&rsquo;t find anything in the literature that supports that time period. In 
your next article on fasting could you address this? I&rsquo;ve tried it and 
it&rsquo;s really not that hard to do. I eat dinner on one day and then just 
skip breakfast the next day and I don&rsquo;t eat anything in between.</p> 
<p>Thanks,<br>
 David</p> 
<p>Hi David&ndash;</p> 
<p>I don&rsquo;t know where Art DeVany got his info on the 15 hours; maybe 
from a paper I haven&rsquo;t read. The authors of the study I quoted in the 
post didn&rsquo;t really even IF; they simply consumed fewer calories on 
alternate days. I don&rsquo;t know if 24 hours is a magic number or not, but it 
seems pretty easy to schedule that way.</p>

<p>Dr. Eades,</p> 
<p>My question regarding this topic:</p> 
<p>I see on many low carb boards the topic of &ldquo;starvation mode.&rdquo; 
There are a lot of opinions out there that your body shifts into this mode if 
you don&rsquo;t eat regularly. I have also seen lots of eating plans that want 
you to eat small meals throughout the day. I think this is just one of those 
thoughts that is repeated over and over and people begin to think it is a fact.
</p> 
<p>What is your opinion?</p> 
<p>Hi Amy&ndash;</p> 
<p>I posted on this sometime in the past. There is a &lsquo;starvation 
response&rsquo; that kicks in after one goes without eating for a day or so. 
Insulin goes down, glucagon goes up, fat is converted to ketone bodies, which 
are burned for energy in many tissues in place of blood sugar, protein is 
converted to glucose to be used by those tissues that can&rsquo;t use ketone 
bodies. That, in a nutshell, is the starvation response. Everything that 
happens is good. Insulin goes down: good. Blood sugar levels go down and 
stabilize: good. Many tissues turn to fat and ketone bodies for energy: good. 
The only bad thing that happens in the starvation response is the loss of 
protein (often from muscle) to make glucose.</p> 
<p>The studies I posted on previously showed that the starvation response can 
be initiated by restricting carbohydrates. It&rsquo;s not the lack of food in 
general that initiates the response; it&rsquo;s the lack of carbohydrate. So, 
if one reduces carbohydrate intake all the good parts of the starvation 
response kick in while the protein in the diet serves to be the substrate for 
the conversion to glucose, leaving the muscle and other protein structures 
intact.</p> 
<p>Hope this helps.</p>

 If I have it correct the timing you used was:<br>
 Day 1: eat 
until 6:00 pm<br>
 Day 2: eat nothing but dinner around 6:00 pm<br>
 Day 3: eat 
breakfast and lunch nothing past 6:00 pm (if your lunch was at noon you could 
stop there as well?)<br>
 Day 4: fast until 6:00 pm<br>
 repeat etc..<br>

<p>I made it 24 hours just fine! It wasn&rsquo;t that hard. For the last 6 
weeks, I&rsquo;ve been eating near purist level PP and &lt; 30g carbs. 
I&rsquo;ve lost 12 pounds (with 85 to go). I did 1hr weight training this 
morning and then ate breakfast after that.</p> 
<p>I will try the suggested rotation over the next week or so. I have a blog 
about my weightloss journey so I will keep that updated. I&rsquo;m a type 2

<p>I just reread your answer to my comment about supplements and realized that 
it doesn&rsquo;t take into account the mag citrate that I take every night 
before retiring. Since it&rsquo;s just one mineral and no calories, will it 
interfere with the fast?</p>

<p>As an avid weightlifter and general physical preparedness buff I have 
always been concerned about not getting enough fuel for the fire. At the same 
time, while strong and aerobically fit, I do not have my body fat where I want 
it. I&rsquo;m starting this IF today with your parameters doc (6 pm to 6 pm). I 
just realized what hurts me is when I try and get food every two hours every 
day is that I tend to overdo it especially if I down a few too many carbs. I 
actually do well during periods of non eating. I feel more alert and less 
cranky. Mentally if I know I can eat at some point, even if is within a window, 
I can hold on. Well here I go, I&rsquo;ll keep you posted, especially with 
regards to my strength training progress and body weight. I&rsquo;m currently 
230 lbs with about 16% BF using those home calipers&hellip;<br>

<p>i&rsquo;m starting tonight! one more question:<br>
 on your eating day, do 
you eat all day long or eat a couple very high calorie meals -or does it matter?
</p> 
<p>it&rsquo;s hard for me to eat that much at one time. is it important to get 
double the calories in, i mean, if one ends up not eating that much more than 
they regularly do on an eating day, is that going to reduce the benefits. is 
the feasting part as important as the fasting?</p> 
<p>Hi Susan&ndash;</p> 
<p>You can eat however you want on your eating days. Lots of little meals or a 
few big meals or big meals interspersed with little meals. You don&rsquo;t have 
to try to eat two days worth of calories in the one day&ndash;just eat until 
you&rsquo;re not hungry and leave it at that. What&rsquo;s more important than 
how many meals you eat on eating days is that you NOT eat any meals on fasting 
days. That&rsquo;s what makes the process work.</p>

<p>Wow, lots of comments on this one! I&rsquo;m going to give it a try. Back 
in my young and skinny days when I lived by myself, I kind of did a variation 
of this. Never ate dinner except when going out during the weekends and that 
more or less might have been my only meal of the day. What changed for me was 
getting married to a guy who is firmly entrenched in the concept of three meals 
a day and believes that some sort of dessert should be a part of at least two 
of them. Strangely enough, I never really noticed the weight I was gaining and 
when I think back then to my complaints of my clothes mysteriously shrinking, I 
have to wonder what universe I was living in that I didn&rsquo;t see what was 
going on. What brought it all to a grinding halt was when about two years later 
in a space of a week, three different people asked me when the baby was due and 
I wasn&rsquo;t pregnant. Heh, that&rsquo;s when the mist cleared from my eyes 
and I realized I was fat. I started exercising, cut out all the desserts, ate 
the usual low-fat crud and did lose a decent amount of weight but then I got 
stuck about 10 pounds away from my goal and nothing changed that for several 
years. Then one day I stumbled onto a LC website which in turn led me to Gary 
Taubs&rsquo; Fat Lie article which then led me to several other sites and 
articles and then ultimately to &ldquo;Protein Power&rdquo; and the rest is 
history. Giving IF a try seems like the next logical step for me to take.</p> 
<p>I do have one question, though. I only drink one cup of coffee a day in the 
morning and it has cream in it as I simply cannot stomach the stuff straight 
(same goes for black tea.) Is this ok or should I look for an alternative 
source of caffeine on those off mornings? Thanks!</p> 
<p>Hi Esther&ndash;</p> 
<p>Well, I would tell you to just buck up and be a man and drink the coffee 
black. Except for the fact that MD is the same way; she can&rsquo;t 
(won&rsquo;t) drink her coffee without cream. I&rsquo;ve tried without success 
for years to get her to see the light. When we did the IF, she drank her coffee 
with cream on her fasting days, so even if I won&rsquo;t, she will give you 
dispensation to do the same. (She drank one or sometimes two cups of coffee 
with cream in the morning, but no more than that.)</p> 
<p>Good luck. Keep me posted.</p>

<p>Hi Mike, this first part of my comment is off topic, and I hope you and 
everyone else forgives me for doing this.</p> 
<p>PPLP was my introduction to diet and autoimmune response. From there, 
I&rsquo;ve devoted a lot of time to investigating autoimmune disorders and the 
association it has with gluten and casein intolerance.</p> 
<p>For the person with ankylosing spondylitis, and the person with chronic 
eczema, totally eliminating gluten from my husband&rsquo;s diet caused total 
remission of his ankylosing spondylitis. He&rsquo;s been flare-up free for 6 
years, and his systemic inflammation is gone. He also had chronic eczema 
associated with his AS disorder. He hasn&rsquo;t had eczema now for the same 
length of time. He also hasn&rsquo;t had a migraine headache since he stopped 
eating gluten. I have corresponded with many people that have also experienced 
remission of their autoimmune disorders when they eliminated gluten from their 
diet. Some people have had to also eliminate casein from their diet to 
experience remission from their autoimmune disorders.</p> 
<p>There has to always be one in the crowd that has to be different&hellip;.I 
think I have already been doing IF. I&rsquo;ve happily eaten only one meal a 
day (dinner) for the past 4-5 years, after switching to strict low carb over 7 
years ago. But it hasn&rsquo;t helped in weight loss or improvement of insulin 
resistance or Phase 1 insulin response. According to my fasting glucose 
numbers, I&rsquo;m still heading down the road to diabetes. I do have PCOS. I 
am not diabetic yet, but it seems I can&rsquo;t stop the progression to 
diabetes. And, I have acquired serious difficulties in cognitive function 
(memory loss and inability to concentrate and focus) and my energy level has 
dropped tremendously. These symptoms suggest hypothyroidism, but according to 
my thyroid tests, my thyroid function is normal.</p> 
<p>For me, I don&rsquo;t see how doing &ldquo;IF&rdquo; is going to do 
anything different to improve my health if only eating once a day for the past 
4-5 years hasn&rsquo;t helped! I certainly don&rsquo;t know yet if eating one 
meal a day for 4-5 years has increased my longevity&hellip;..</p> 
<p>I don&rsquo;t mean to be a cynic or be negative about it all. It&rsquo;s 
just that my experience with low carb and IF (if one meal a day is considered 
to be IF) hasn&rsquo;t produced the expected &ldquo;benefits&rdquo; for me. 
Going back to high carb low fat isn&rsquo;t the answer either, as that will 
greatly hasten the progression to diabetes!</p> 
<p>Perhaps IF only benefits those people that do not do low carb in the first 
place, and those that still eat grains and gluten.</p> 
<p>Hi Georgette&ndash;</p> 
<p>Thanks for the discourse on anti-inflammatory disorders and gluten and 
casein. It is very true that both of these substances can (and often do) cause 
serious autoimmune problems through the process of molecular mimicry.</p> 
<p>As to your weight-loss and diabetic history, I find it all very puzzling. 
The low-carb diet, especially a low-carb diet taken in IF structure, is the 
gold standard for treatment of diabetes and obesity in a system that is 
operating properly. (It would seem to be obvious if someone has diabetes or 
obesity that the system isn&rsquo;t operating properly, but that isn&rsquo;t 
the case. Diabetes and/or obesity are responses of a properly operating system 
to the incorrect diet) If the regimen doesn&rsquo;t work, then the system must 
be malfunctioning. Were I you, I would seek out a competent endocrinologist for 
a thorough evaluation. In reading your history a number of problems come to 
mind&ndash;cyclical Cushing&rsquo;s, pituitary adenoma, a glucagon-secreting 
tumor (usually benign), multiple endocrine adenopathy (MEA), just to name a 
few&ndash;all of which can be tracked down and treated by someone who knows 
what he or she is doing.</p> 
<p>I hope you ferret out the problem. Keep me posted.</p>

<p>Hi Dr. Eades,</p> 
<p>I will pass along your good luck wishes on our thread. Several people have 
successfully made it through their first fasting day.</p> 
<p>I started my fasting tonight, so I hope tomorrow I can manage to make it 
through the remaining 24 hr. I was planning on making a batch of Power Muffins 
(cranberry, after reading MD&rsquo;s blog the other day) this weekend. Now I 
know I will have to wait until the fast is done before I attempt this. I think 
they would be too difficult to resist after smelling them baking.</p> 
<p>One question about supplements. I have decided to take all my supplements 
at night now (before the fasting begins or just after it ends), instead of 
taking some in the morning and some at night. The reason for this is that the 
cod liver oil (was 1 tsp 2x day, which is 90 calories total) and krill oil (2 
capsules in am), have calories. I&rsquo;m not sure if the vitamin E has 
calories. Does this make sense, in terms of not having any calories during the 
fasting period?</p> 
<p>Thanks again,<br>
 Cathy</p> 
<p>Hi Cathy&ndash;</p> 
<p>I don&rsquo;t think the minuscule number of calories in fish oil/krill oil 
is going to foul anything up with the IF. Were I you, I would take them 
whenever most convenient. When MD and I did our various versions of the IF it 
never occurred to us to change our supplement regimen.</p>

<p>In a previous blog, you suggest eating less than 100 grams of carb a day to 
stay in some degree of ketosis.</p> 
<p>http://www.proteinpower.com/drmike/archives/2006/02/in_going_throug.html</p>
<p>If you eat every other 24 hours, would that suggested maximum carb intake 
stay the same (100 grams during the non-fasting period, 0 during the fasting)?
</p> 
<p>Along the same lines, if I eat a multivitamin that&rsquo;s meant to be 
taken twice a day, should I double the dose during the fasting period, or keep 
the doses the same?</p> 
<p>Hi imsovain&ndash;</p> 
<p>The virtue of IF is that one doesn&rsquo;t have to worry so much about 
counting carbs, calories or anything else. The every other day nature of the 
thing obviates all that. If you want to stay on the same low-carb regimen as 
usual, just stick with the 100 grams per day. You won&rsquo;t have to worry 
about whether or not you&rsquo;re in ketosis on the fast days&ndash;you will be.
</p> 
<p>Take the supplements on your regular schedule as if you weren&rsquo;t IFing.

<p>she drank her coffee with cream on her fasting days, so even if I 
won&rsquo;t, she will give you dispensation to do the same.</p> 
<p>That one had me laughing out loud. I&rsquo;m weird with my coffee, viz. add 
lots of stuff like hazelnut butter and/or shredded coconut.</p> 
<p>But now a few more questions. You&rsquo;ve already addressed the muscle 
loss Q. Yet, from the literature I&rsquo;ve read, I vividly remember that 2 
meals are very important. 1. breakfast for starting up metabolism and make one 
lose fat more easily. 2. dinner for retaining muscle mass. So, I&rsquo;m 
hesitant to cut out either one of them, will start with 2 meals/day every 12 
hrs at 10 am /10pm first to &lsquo;test&rsquo; the waters.</p> 
<p>Second Q: how much does metabolism slow down?<br>
 From my private 
experience I know that I&rsquo;d lose weight very rapidly in the first week of 
cutting out calories and then I&rsquo;d stall completely.<br>
 From the various 
bodybuilding-related literature a 20% calorie restriction seems to be the only 
real sustainable one to produce ongoing fat loss. Fasting for 24 hrs would make 
it harder to eat enough, isn&rsquo;t it. Eating several meals/day on the 
non-fasting days would indeed make things more easy.</p> 
<p>Third Q: I&rsquo;d assume/presume that it&rsquo;d be the best strategy to 
work out after having had 2 meals like working out after breakfast rather than 
at the end of a fast? Why would some people do it before? Growth hormone output 
as suggested in Natural Hormone Enhancement by Faigin doesn&rsquo;t seem to be 
as important as it is said to be.</p> 
<p>Hi Yvana&ndash;</p> 
<p>Metabolic rate is more correlated to body weight than anything else. A 
number of studies have been done with subjects in metabolic chambers, and just 
about all have shown that the subject&rsquo;s weight pretty much established 
their metabolic rates, not other factors such as meal timing, etc. So, if you 
lose weight, you decrease metabolic rate.</p> 
<p>There is a thermic effect of food. In other words foods require energy from 
the body to deal with them. One of the nice things about the IF is that 
calories can stay pretty much the same&ndash;providing the same thermic effect 
of food&ndash;and still allow weight loss and improvement in all kinds of 
health parameters. Cutting calories by eating less on a daily basis 
wouldn&rsquo;t necessarily do the same, and you would lose the thermic effect 
of the calories that aren&rsquo;t consumed.</p> 
<p>Good luck.</p>

<p>Mike,</p> 
<p>OK last one &ndash; what about all the supposed dangers of skipping meals? 
Dr. Schwarzbein as well as many other &lsquo;experts&rsquo; talk about this in 
their books. She claims that skipping meals is very bad for hormonal tone and 
further damages one&rsquo;s metabolism. True or false?</p> 
<p>Hi Fred&ndash;</p> 
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe it is true. When I posted on IF I simply summarized 
the research data out there, which shows many, many benefits in animal models 
and in the few human studies that have been done. This isn&rsquo;t a matter of 
opinion; this is what the research shows. Why does it work this way? Who knows? 
The fact is that it does. Someday someone will probably get around to figuring 
out why. My bet is that it will have something to do with our genome that was 
created over millennia of natural selection to operate optimally on low-carb, 
high-fat, high-protein diets taken in on a variable timing pattern.</p>

<p>Just wanted to say good luck to all those that try IF regime. I personally 
do Calorie Restriction and have done for 2 years, with amazing results that 
puts me at very low risk of many diseases (have had lots of tests done). I am 
sure that IF will have similar benefit&rsquo;s for you, and may exceed CR in 
some areas. If you do carry this out long term you could also be significantly 
extending your lifespan also.</p> 
<p>I&rsquo;d also be very interested if anyone here could monitor their health 
by getting a baseline blood test done now, and then one later on sometime.</p> 
<p>I am well aware of the benefits of CR as I&rsquo;ve read many published 
papers on human, rodent and non-human primate studies, but am unsure about what 
effects IF has in terms of glucose, insulin, cholesterol, CRP, blood pressure, 
temperature and so on.</p> 
<p>Matt</p> 
<p>Hi Matt&ndash;</p> 
<p>Thanks for the update on your CR experience. Not many people have what it 
takes to do such a thing over the long term.</p> 
<p>The studies on IF pretty much universally show that all the benefits of CR 
plus some can be had without calorically restricting as long as food is taken 
in every other day.</p>

<p>Dr. Mike,</p> 
<p>I very much appreciate your comments. I am truly at my wit&rsquo;s end with 
what I&rsquo;ve been experiencing. I do believe I have something going on, but 
I don&rsquo;t know of any doctor in my rural area that I can trust, especially 
considering the major clinic is an HMO, and that&rsquo;s where my health 
insurance is through.</p> 
<p>I have wondered for the past year about Cushing&rsquo;s, as I have many 
symptoms that match it. And, a pituitary adenoma could be a factor, since that 
can cause Cushing&rsquo;s, too. No one else in my family has symptoms of it.</p>
<p>Do you know of any good doctors in the Spokane, WA area? I&rsquo;d even 
consider going to a doctor in the Seattle area or even Portland, Oregon, if I 
could actually get help with what&rsquo;s happening with me.</p> 
<p>Again, thank you for your comments. I will be happy to keep you posted. I 
just don&rsquo;t know when this will all be resolved!</p> 
<p>OK&hellip;back to the regular scheduled programming&hellip;.. </p> 
<p>Hi Georgette&ndash;</p> 
<p>I do happen to know of someone in Spokane who could help you. My former 
nurse, Debbie Judd, is in Spokane and has a metabolic clinic along with her 
physician husband. I checked with her and they would be happy to hear from you.

<p>Sir away with you..are you serious you don&rsquo;t know what a Yurt is ?<br>
 Surely you&rsquo;ve seen piccies ?<br>
 Originated in..well there&rsquo;s much 
debate but they are still the preferred shelter in Mongolia.<br>
 One makes a 
crown (or tono in Mongolian) out of whatever wood&hellip;its circular, made of 
8 1/4 pieces staggered for strength 3 inches depth and 6 wide with 52 equally 
spaced holes drilled at 33 degrees on the outer surface(diff designs of course 
have diff configs ) it also has circular bridges from/to all 4 points.<br>
 One 
then makes 110 6ft batons( routed edges, so nice and smooth) all drilled 
differently. One makes 4 lattice work frames by affixing said baton with 4mm 
cord(trad leather or twine&hellip;.the self supporting structure is basically 
unchanged in design for 2500-3000 yrs)<br>
 One makes roof poles to fit in the 
holes and sit atop the lattice work drilled with a loop of cord thats fits over 
one &lsquo;v&rsquo; of the lattice.<br>
 One then makes a cover out of rain 
proof and fire retardent canvas. One lines it with felt if Wintering in it 
(good apparently trad down to -50 in Mongolia)<br>
 Takes about 1 hr top erect 
and a reasonably made frame is suggested to last 100 years if moved a few times 
per year..one moved say once weekly good for 20 plus years. Trad given as 
wedding gift.<br>
 Am halfway thru the lattice work having finished the crown. 
Not being a wood worker this has been quite the learning curve and the crown 
being the hardest part is what i tackled first.<br>
 Since living in Africa and 
the years afore where i trudged around the world with tent i really adore being 
outside and Ger is wonderful.Spacious, light, deeply relaxing blah blah<br>
 
Ours is 16ft diameter, doug fir. The crown is a bit of a bollocks-up as its a 
bit chunky(christened McTono!) but am told by master Ger makers that its fine 
as the extra weight is needed anyways to puch down on the roof poles and eq. 
distribute the weight on the lattice work.<br>
 Add one Yak pulled cart with 
almost circular wheels and you&rsquo;re good to go.</p> 
<p>So there you go !</p>

<p>Hi Doc!</p> 
<p>I read through the posts and noticed a few questions we have had some 
experience with. The state of ketosis is intimately tied to insulin 
sensitivity&hellip;if one is insulin resistant ketosis may be difficult or 
impossible to reach. It is interesting to note that ketosis, even under short 
term caloric restriction, shows a potent protein sparing effect. Some of the 
work by Matson shows a pronounced increase in IGF (insulin like growth 
factors&hellip;at least in mice) AND significant increases in pulsitile growth 
hormone release. We have several athletes who have endeavored to eat a caloric 
excess in conjunction with 16-20hr fast and have increased lean muscle mass and 
performance in both anaerobic and aerobic activities. Intermittent Fasting 
shows many of the same characteristics as anaerobic sprint intervals with 
regards to preference for fat as a fuel source and acute adrenal cortical 
stress response which appears to underlie much of the favorable adaptations. 
Our athletes have used a cyclic low carb diet with primarily 
&ldquo;paleo&rdquo; foods. This appears to be of benefit not only to endurance 
athletes but power athletes as well. Very interesting stuff.<br>

<p>Well, I made it through the first 24 hours. Longest I have gone without 
food my entire life. One thing it did was clue me in to how often I tend to 
eat, even small amounts, and how much I focus on food..too much. Other than 
that it was not too bad. I seemed more alert during the day.<br>
 When it was 
time for my 6 pm feed I was at work (I&rsquo;m a police officer) so I had a 
blimpie turkey sandwich. More carbs than I usually would, but Dr. Eades said it 
was ok from what I was reading. It was the best sandwich I&rsquo;ve ever 
tasted..I ate it fast and was still hungry. I just got home from work at 2 am, 
will sleep and wake up to attack breakfast and lunch and whatever else for the 
feed day. Thats my first day of IF&hellip;went ok, I survived&hellip;and feel 
pretty good.</p>

I am VERY interested in trying this IF plan for myself to see if I can drop 
another 15-20 pounds after my 180-pound weight loss on low-carb in 2004.</p> 
<p>My question is regarding my workout schedule. I usually get in a 30-45 
minute cardio workout on the elliptical machine during my lunch hour at work. 
I&rsquo;m concerned on the days when I don&rsquo;t eat until suppertime that I 
will not have the energy to exercise.</p>

<p>I gained a tremendous amount of weight in my 40s &ndash; during a time of 
trauma/stress and overwork. I was told it was because I was on the &ldquo;sumo 
wrestler&rdquo; diet &ndash; not eating anything all day and then collapsing in 
the evening and eating way too much. Granted, there were lots of carbs! I 
haven&rsquo;t had any success losing weight on any plan &ndash; low cal, low 
carb &ndash; I just seem to lose and gain the same 15 pounds every year. I am 
now inching towards type 2. I&rsquo;ve struggled to get into the habit of 
eating breakfast &ndash; especially a high protein breakfast &ndash; and on a 
positive note I now exercise regularly and take good supplements. Would someone 
who gained weight on this schedule before possibly benefit from adopting it in 
a different way? Because I always feel so much conflict when I eat, it would be 
a blessing to just let it go 24 hours at a time.</p> 
<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>Hi Patricia&ndash;</p> 
<p>What have you got to lose. Give it a whirl and see what happens. If going 
without food for 24 hours holds no terrors for you, it might be just the 
regimen that works. If I were in your shoes and doing the program I would eat 
low-carb during my eat days.</p>

<p>No response required if you&rsquo;re busy doctor; I can&rsquo;t believe the 
effort you put into this. I&rsquo;m a blogger (a lousy one at 
consistency)&hellip; I know. Perhaps at your convenience you could address this 
in the future if busy now.</p> 
<p>What about people who are just starting out on lowcarb. I did a brief 
(&gt;1 month) lowcarb years ago. Given it essentially changed my life (about 10 
major health issues cleared up miraculously after 10 days &mdash; probably from 
ditching all gluten and milk during the period) I can&rsquo;t explain why I 
went off it aside from &ldquo;sheer laziness and working 120 hours a week while 
single mom-ing a small child&rdquo; just made having to worry about planning 
and cooking too big a pain. Now I&rsquo;m going back on it. I&rsquo;m severely 
obese (still) and just starting out here, so I&rsquo;m wondering &ndash;</p> 
<p>1. Would your IF idea be any kind of a problem during an Atkins-like 
induction period, do you think? Would this situation change your feelings on 
it? Most the commenters here (and you and the missus) sound like you&rsquo;ve 
been doing LC for eons.</p> 
<p>2. I gained well over 200 lbs in less than 2 years, many many years ago. 
Actually my whole family (females only for some reason) tend to do this in the 
mid-20&prime;s; I denied it and it happened anyway. (I wonder if insulin 
resistance can kick in at a certain age genetically?) The weight gain period 
was eating mostly 1 meal a day, of megacarbs before collapsing into my 4 hours 
of sleep. Always sitting, super high stress, but I attributed this mass gain in 
part to the only eating once a day thing and my metabolism just shutting down. 
So it&rsquo;s been fascinating to read your comments (and the comments of 
others) in favor of 1 meal a day.</p> 
<p>I still tend to eat once a day (around dinnertime), though I grant junk, 
and I don&rsquo;t lose weight&ndash;but at 467 as of today, you&rsquo;d think 
I&rsquo;d have to eat a refrigerator a day to maintain that, sheesh. I am 
guessing that &ldquo;it must be relatively lowcarb&rdquo; is the entire 
difference!</p> 
<p>I love fasting. I used to do it just for fun (obviously insane at a young 
age) when in my teens (really amps up the &lsquo;esoteric awareness&rsquo; 
bit). Can I incorporate your IF ideas into my induction, which is going to 
last&hellip; oh, at this weight, the rest of my natural life probably&hellip; 
without it being a problem?</p> 
<p>Best. PJ</p> 
<p>Hi PJ</p> 
<p>I have seen no published studies showing how the IF would work for someone 
weighing 467 lbs. That doesn&rsquo;t mean that it won&rsquo;t work (I figure it 
probably would); it just means that as far as I know there is no collected data.
</p> 
<p>I (and many other physicians using LC diets) have had a number of patients 
with weights in that range who have done very well on Protein Power-style 
low-carb diets. I would caution you, however, before starting such a regimen 
that if you are on any medications or have any secondary health issues, you 
must see a physician skilled in the use of low-carb diets. These diets are 
extremely potent therapeutic tools for weight loss and health improvement, but 
they often require early medication adjustments.</p> 
<p>Good luck. Keep me posted. Find a capable doc.</p>

<p>This sounds very interesting. When I was a child my mother used to freak 
out because I wouldn&rsquo;t want to eat breakfast and often went without; as 
an adult while trying to &ldquo;eat healthy&rdquo; I have to force myself to 
eat breakfast. I&rsquo;m just not hungry in the mornings. I recently came 
across some of my old journals from the mid-nineties when I was extremely poor, 
and I was only eating once a day &hellip; but I was in pretty good health and 
the thinnest I&rsquo;ve ever been and I don&rsquo;t remember being particularly 
hungry. I think a lot of us forget what real hunger feels like in this era of 
24-hour food on demand. I know I have. A schedule like you and Mary Dan have 
set up sounds doable, and I&rsquo;m going to try it.</p>

<p>Dr. Eades:<br>
 A most interesting subject indeed. I too am an avid reader 
of your blog, but this is my first post.<br>
 Reading about IF, I just realized 
that I was most successful losing weight on what seems to be a variant of IF, 
though it was not done purposefully.<br>
 What triggered my thoughts was the 
discussion about length of fast-was 15 hours enough.<br>
 Here is what happened 
with me. I was following a strict Protein Power low carb plan, and would 
routinely go from after dinner[at around 630pm] till close to noon next day 
without any calorie intake, so had a 16 to 20 hour window each day without any 
calories. I lost weight rapidly and felt very energized. My wife continued to 
eat three meals a day, also PP, and struggled mightily with weight loss.<br>
 
Do you think that eating pattern was close enough to IF to have pushed the 
results I had? [70 pound loss in 11 months]<br>
 I am definitely starting a 
real IF today.</p>

<p>Hi John&ndash;</p> 
<p>Keep me posted on your progress. I don&rsquo;t know if 24 hours is the 
magic number or not. Could be 15 could be 30. Until a number of studies are 
done, I guess we won&rsquo;t know for sure. MD and I settled on the regimen 
that we did because it breaks up the day nicely and gave us something to eat 
every day.</p>

<p>Hi Jimmy&ndash;</p> 
<p>Since and Atkins shake contains calories, if you took it in you would not 
be fasting. Many people don&rsquo;t realize that caloric liquids&ndash;as far 
as the metabolic system is concerned&ndash;are no different that solid foods. 
One of the jobs of your teeth and your stomach acid is to convert solid foods 
into liquid foods. So it doesn&rsquo;t matter whether it&rsquo;s a protein 
shake or a rib-eye steak when it goes in your mouth, by the time it reaches 
your small intestine where it is absorbed and kicks off all the metabolic 
processes it is a liquid.</p>

<p>A couple of questions for you Dr. Mike&hellip;.</p> 
<p>First, if it&rsquo;s not too personal a question, do you mind sharing why 
you and your wife stopped doing IF given all the benefits you list? Was it just 
too inconvenient in the long run?</p> 
<p>Second, I thought one of the greatest benefits of the CRON lifestyle was 
the extended lifespan, but unless I missed it, I see no mention of that as a 
benefit of IF. Has that possible benefit not been studied or just not found to 
be a benefit in the studies done?</p> 
<p>And to end, may I just add my voice to the chorus thanking you for such an 
interesting and provocative article and an overall interesting blog.</p> 
<p>Valerie</p> 
<p>Hi Valerie&ndash;</p> 
<p>Thanks for the kind words about the blog. MD and I tried the IF for a while 
just to see if it were truly a practical regimen that could be followed easily. 
We found that it indeed is. We didn&rsquo;t really go off of it completely. We 
only eat a couple of times per day most days and often go for long stretches 
where we don&rsquo;t eat at all. We found that worked better for us than 
setting a more strict regimen.</p> 
<p>As to the life extension qualities of IF, I think I mentioned that in the 
blog, but didn&rsquo;t really stress it. Thanks for bringing it up. One of the 
main advantages of IF is that it provides the same longevity benefits as CR, 
but without the caloric restriction. The animals that were on the IF regimen 
ended up eating as much as the animals that were fed ad lib (they ate twice as 
much on feeding days to make up for not eating on fasting days), but lived as 
long as the animals on 30-40% caloric restriction.</p> 
<p>Hope this helps.</p>

<p>I started with only eating breakfast and lunch on Sep. 14 as soon as I 
finished reading your blog. So far I have to say it is not really easy but 
quite possible. I have now finished my 5th day with only breakfast and lunch 
again (tomorrow it will be dinner only and of course a snack at bedtime). I am 
still waiting to see if I have benefits. I only weigh 128 pounds so if I do 
lose it will be slowly, I&rsquo;m sure. I would like to lose the 8 pounds that 
have crept on in the last year and a half. I have been low carbing for years 
and I do not lose on low carb if I don&rsquo;t restrict calories as well but I 
find it impossible to restrict calories when I don&rsquo;t low carb. I bought 
your &ldquo;Protein Power&rdquo; book as soon as it came out (and loved it) I 
also have &ldquo;Thin So Fast&rdquo; and I want to thank you for writing them

<p>I think I still have the same question regarding, or rather comparing a 
well followed protein-adequate/carbohydrate-controlled approach like Protein 
Power with an intermittent fast. Since my definition of life extension is a 
little different, I only look at the benefits and quite frankly, I don&rsquo;t 
find IF superior than say Protein Power. Even compared to plain caloric 
restriction, carbohydrate control (as you wrote it once), is perhaps the most 
clever way to reduce calories for those who still buy into the standard calorie 
rule.</p> 
<p>Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I don&rsquo;t argue the reported benefits 
attributed to IF, but so far, and this is just a personal comment before I get 
jumped at, I don&rsquo;t see the need of dealing with the practicalities of 
having to set a particular time to eat (which may or not fit into my life, 
which tends to be full of unexpected events), plus dealing with the apparent 
constant thought of how much I&rsquo;m going to enjoy f&rsquo;east-day&rsquo;. 
Of course we get used to almost everything, even to not eating or not sleeping 
enough, and I wonder how much of that is true effect of IF and how much comes 
from our minds shutting down feelings of hunger as a coping mechanism. 
Anecdotically, even before I heard of Protein Power, I &lsquo;got used 
to&rsquo; not eating breakfast and I didn&rsquo;t feel hungry at all until 
lunch time, but that didn&rsquo;t mean it was doing me any good. Anyway, just 
pondering ideas here. I suppose the message I take is that if the circumstances 
so demand it, at least I know that there is benefit in a little fasting but 
only if the circumstances so demand it.</p> 
<p>This fascinating topic has generated a lot of posts on the Protein Power 
board, which is good. However, there seems to be a bit of confusion with 
&ldquo;what is the way to go now&hellip; Dr. Mike now says we need to fast to 
get better health&hellip; whatever happened to Protein Power then?&rdquo; 
[that's the current perception from some of the participants]</p> 
<p>To me it&rsquo;s still clear Mike, but would you mind clarifying your 
position just a tad for those who are new to Protein Power but are now 
wondering what exactly is your advice regarding a comprehensive, sustainable 
and beneficial nutritional plan? Thanks a lot in advance.</p> 
<p>Hi Gabe&ndash;</p> 
<p>Thanks for all you help with the board and your concern. See today&rsquo;s

<p>Hi Simon&ndash;</p> 
<p>I know that cancer cells can&rsquo;t use ketones for energy and must turn 
to glucose to grow and reproduce. Which, in my opinion, makes it almost 
criminal to put patients with cancer on low-fat, high-carbohydrate diets.</p>

<p>Dear Dr. Mike,</p> 
<p>I&rsquo;ve been on IF for 48 hours now and I&rsquo;m gonna be honest with 
you&ndash;I HATE IT! </p> 
<p>While I knew I would be quite hungry after my first fast day, when 6:00PM 
rolled around I felt like I couldn&rsquo;t stop eating. In fact, I ate four 
times in that first hour and I was STILL hungry.</p> 
<p>And in Day 2, something really strange happened to me when I went to 
workout. Despite the fact that I could eat during the daytime, I had to back 
off on both the intensity and resistance of the elliptical machine I use 
because I didn&rsquo;t have the energy to exercise as I have daily for the past 
three years.</p> 
<p>While I can certainly appreciate what IF is supposed to do to help people 
reduce their caloric intake, I couldn&rsquo;t see myself doing this again after 
this first week unless it gets a whole lot better in the next day or so.</p> 
<p>But, I&rsquo;m not a quitter and since I committed to doing it for at least 
a week, I will see it through to the end. Please make the pain go away! </p>

<p>Be careful you are drinking plenty of water. When we don&rsquo;t eat we 
often don&rsquo;t have much desire to drink, but we need to. Have a little salt 
with it. I found when I tried to exercise my first day doing this I 
couldn&rsquo;t because I was dehydrated. When I drink water, I can exercise.</p>

<p>Hi, Dr. E. -</p> 
<p>Stumbled upon your blog and found it fascinating.</p> 
<p>I&rsquo;m wondering if you have suggestions for adapting IF for children. 
</p> 
<p>My son is ten, overweight by about 30 pounds, and I fear he will become 
diabetic. (His birthmother was obese and diabetic at a young age.)</p> 
<p>He&rsquo;s quite active, has an excellent lower-carb diet and doesn&rsquo;t 
eat massive quantities of food. He&rsquo;s homeschooled, so I prepare all his 
meals and snacks. Yet he gains weight at the drop of a hat.</p> 
<p>His bio half-brother, whom we also adopted, eats almost exactly the same 
stuff and same amounts and is skinny as rail.</p> 
<p>He has been checked out by endocrinologists and so on and no physical cause 
for his weight issues have been identified. The doctors just say, &ldquo;make 
him eat less.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>As you can imagine, it is not easy to put a child on a calorie-restricted 
diet, for a variety of reasons.</p> 
<p>He constantly claims he is &ldquo;starving,&rdquo; and this is on a regular 
diet!</p> 
<p>Even if it were appropriate (and in his case I do believe a somewhat 
aggressive approach is justified), he could never handle even the modified IF 
schedule you propose.</p> 
<p>I am wondering, though, if you think there would be any benefit to trying 
the schedule used in the study you cited&mdash;50% on one day, 144% on the next.
</p> 
<p>Then, I&rsquo;m wondering if there are any suggestions on how one might 
&ldquo;disguise&rdquo; the 50% day. First, I&rsquo;m thinking, of course, with 
activities and other distractions. But as for the meals&mdash;what is your view 
of diet sodas, loading meals with low-calorie foods so as to meet the 50% goal, 
etc.?</p> 
<p>Any help you can give would be very appreciated. </p> 
<p>Hi Nellie&ndash;</p> 
<p>I understand your frustration. I&rsquo;ve had no experience with children 
on the IF, so I can&rsquo;t really make a recommendation. I would recommend, 
however, that you maybe get your son reevaluated by another endocrinologist, 
maybe one more attuned to weight issues.</p> 
<p>Good luck.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m a Insulin dependant type 2 diabetic RN&hellip;yep&hellip;I knew 
better.<br>
 I&rsquo;ve been able to cut my insulin in 1/2 by controlling 
carbs, adding in exercise every day and now doing the IF.<br>
 It&rsquo;s 
working..my fastings are lower&hellip;I feel pretty good. I love the feeling of 
freedom from always thinking about food and with less injected insulin 
I&rsquo;m getting away from the &ldquo;feed the insulin&rdquo; feeling that it 
can cause.<br>
 My question is more on timing. I have been limiting myself to 
one meal a day&hellip;.timing depends on schedule and one snack as a meal a 
day&hellip;.something like a low carb soup. What I am enjoying is the 
anticipation of my meal and the fun in preparing it and the feeling of being 
satisfied after that meal. Is the timing the main criteria? I&rsquo;ll be less 
scheduled when I get off insulin completely but to do that more weight loss has 
to occur. Once that occurs then I can be more flexible.</p>

<p>Mike&hellip;My friend who was an avid LC&rsquo;er along with me has been 
going to a trainer at a gym. He has him eating 5 large chicken and veggie meals 
a day (no fat) and told him if he didn&rsquo;t eat 5 meals a day his metabolism 
would die and he would not build muscle. I have heard that if you skip a meal 
esp breakfast that it will hurt your metabolism and it scares me as even though 
I have strictly followed a LC diet for 4 years (I am very educated in LC I had 
two brick and morter LC stores and now have a websitehttp://www.kickthecarbz.com
 since I had to close my stores) I still have 25 stubborn lbs to lose. I know 
Dr. Atkins said do not eat unless you are hungry even breakfast. I am never 
every hungry in the morn or really most of the day. My husband and I wish 
actually they had a pill you could take and just skip food altogether lol. I 
would like to try this but again will it kill my metabolism? I&rsquo;m sorry I 
can not remember his name but the guy who started &ldquo;Curves&rdquo; wrote a 
book and had an interesting fasting concept in it. This is off of the subject 
but I wish you would do some research into bio identical hormones and thyroid 
and how the problems leading up to needing these meds affect an older 
women&rsquo;s weight and how LC can fight into her life. I would bet you would 
sell a ton of books on the subject esp since all of the women in the WHI flow 
fat study were post meno..</p> 
<p>Hi Linda&ndash;</p> 
<p>The portion of metabolism affected by diet is relatively small. The main 
part of your metabolic rate is set by your weight. Based on the studies 
I&rsquo;ve read, I don&rsquo;t think the IF is going to do much of anything to 
your metabolic rate: it certainly won&rsquo;t &lsquo;die.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Thanks again for covering this topic on your blog. You have been quite 
generous with your time in responding to everyone&rsquo;s comments and 
questions!</p> 
<p>You asked for us to let you know how IF is going for us.</p> 
<p>Since you indicated there isn&rsquo;t enough research to determine the 
&ldquo;magic&rdquo; number of hours or perfect schedule, I selected what would 
work for me long term. I&rsquo;m eating between 5 and 10 p.m. every day, 
fasting the rest of the time.</p> 
<p>Here&rsquo;s my experience so far, after doing my version of IF for 5 days 
(today is the 6th). (I&rsquo;m eating how I normally do when I&rsquo;m being 
&ldquo;good&rdquo; about carbs &mdash; somewhere between 50 and 100 g per day. 
I have been convinced since way before you published PP that LC is the way to 
go, since I&rsquo;ve struggled with reactive hypoglycemia for many years. I am 
even more convinced about LC/adequate protein since reading your books.)</p> 
<p>The main benefit of this IF experiment for me so far is the fact that this 
way of eating fits in with what has always just &ldquo;felt right&rdquo; to me. 
The freedom from being required to follow rules of eating &ldquo;three squares 
at 7 a.m., noon, and 6 p.m., plus snacks&rdquo; is worth the price of admission 
for me. (I&rsquo;m delighted that there is evidence that I&rsquo;m not harming 
myself eating the way I prefer.)</p> 
<p>Other benefits of note so far:</p> 
<p>I feel fantastic physically. No energy drops during the day. Noticeably 
improved endurance when working out. I&rsquo;m working out 1 to 3 hours prior 
to my first meal, so approximately 15 hours after last eating. (I&rsquo;d 
estimate at least a 50% improvement in endurance here; subjective, I know.)</p> 
<p>I feel great mentally/emotionally &mdash; good mental energy and focus, 
even keel with emotions.</p> 
<p>I had taken measurements a couple of days before starting the IF. I took 
them again yesterday &mdash; 5 days after changing to this way of eating. I 
have lost 5 inches spread out over 5 measurements on the torso (chest, bust, 
under bust, waist, and hips). In the same period of time I have gained half a 
pound (which I take to mean I basically weigh the same).</p> 
<p>I had blood lipids measured a couple of weeks ago (I tend to have higher 
numbers than I&rsquo;d like.) I have an appointment to have those checked again 
next month some time. I plan on staying with the IF until after my next blood 
tests and doctor&rsquo;s appointment in October. I&rsquo;m also tracking my 
blood pressure (just one reading a day), so I&rsquo;ll be able to see if there 
is any trend there.</p> 
<p>Certainly not statistically significant with a sample size of 1 and no 
control, but enough good stuff happening here to keep me interested and 
motivated to continue for a while.</p> 
<p>Hi Peggyjo&ndash;</p> 
<p>Thank you very much for taking the time to give such a complete update. 
It&rsquo;s interesting that you seem to have more endurance while others report 
less.</p> 
<p>Please keep me posted as you go along, especially about the blood tests.</p>

<p>Today is one week on the program, and I have neither gained or lost any 
weight at all (128 pounds) but my waist measurement at the naval has gone up 
nearly 1 3/4 inches. I am afraid that may mean excess cortisol production from 
stress and since the only stress I can think of is from the IF diet I do wonder 
about it. Do you have any suggestions of any thing else it could be? Other than 
that I feel OK and am not finding it too hard. I certainly look forward to 
dinner after skipping three meals, and it it does taste good.</p> 
<p>Ruth</p> 
<p>Hi Ruth&ndash;</p> 
<p>I doubt that your increase in abdominal girth is from excess cortisol. It 
just doesn&rsquo;t work that quickly. Without a detailed history I would be 
hesitant to make a diagnosis over the Internet. One thing to consider would be 
fluid retention as a function of carb intake. If you have previously been on a 
strict low-carb diet then started an IF with a lot of carbs, you could have a 
short term fluid retention that could both increase your abdominal 
circumference and mask a real weight loss.</p>

98 to 85 within 2 days and I lost 3 pounds. I felt very strong on my weight 
training and bike ride even on and empty stomach at the end of the fast. I got 
a burst of energy. I&rsquo;m going off the 24hr on off and do will it more 
sporadically for a while. My brain tingled. Must be new nerve cells getting

breaking the fast.</p>

<p>Hi Dr. Mike! I decided to check in at the end of the week. I was waiting 
for Dr MD to weigh in on IF, guess she saw the monster you created and decided 
to steer clear. I lost 2 3/4 lbs and most likely would have lost more but fell 
prey to a jar of peanut butter. I know better than to buy it but every time I 
tell myself I can control this obsession I have, Oh well it is gone now,( The 
peanut butter, not the obsession with it) but I digress. I felt perfectly 
normal.I walked 2 miles twice a day(3 mph) and worked out at Curves 3 times. I 
always have worked out on an empty stomach because I read somewhere you then 
burn the fat that is stored rather than using the energy you just ingested, or 
something to that effect. I have a problem with hunger tho. If I waited to eat 
until my tummy said eat It could be days.I know at no time did I truly feel 
hungry not even after the 24 hour fast. I learned a lot about food too. I have 
always eaten several small meals. Like the gorilla I eat all the time. It was 
all I ever heard, The AOE is most likely responsible for that, I felt a great 
deal of freedom not having to think about food and saved a bunch of money. I 
think I will give the IF another week. This is the most I have lost in 1 week 
in over 2 years. Once I got most of the weight off I seemed to quit losing, or 
slowed to near stop, 1 lb a month is as near a stop as I can tell. Sorry about 
the length of this, I write like I talk, fast and alot.Wishing good heath to

<p>If it has worked before, go for it. As I&rsquo;ve said in reply to a number

Even with only two meals a day, I find I&rsquo;m having to stop before I really

<p>Thank you so much for your prompt reply. It must be water retention, but I 
am still low carbing. Not as low as induction but low. I have not kept strict 
numbers on calories or carbs since starting this thinking it was unnecessary, 
but maybe I had better. I am still waiting for relief from allergy symptoms and 
hoping desperately for memory improvement, and longevity if possible. I&rsquo;m

<p>I realize this isn&rsquo;t a diet per se but I was wondering if it is 
possible to lose weight with the 24 on 24 off fasting plan? Or does it put your 
body into survival mode and not let it lose any fat or weight? I have only been 
trying this for a few days but it is fairly easy to stick to and if I reap the 
other benefits then it is well worth it. But I would like to lose 5 or so 
pounds and am hoping this would help me do that. Thanks.</p> 
<p>Hi Misty&ndash;</p> 
<p>A lot depends on how much you eat during the &lsquo;eat&rsquo; days. If you 
eat double what you would normally eat, you probably won&rsquo;t lost much. The 
lab animals that did the IF and ate double on eat days got all the health and 
longevity benefits that the animals did on caloric restriction, but they 
didn&rsquo;t lose a lot of weight. If you eat about what you normally eat or 
even a little more when you&rsquo;re non-fasting on your &lsquo;eat&rsquo; day, 
you should lose weight.</p>

<p>Ok, I used to do this about 25 years ago. I was very overweight and wanted 
to diet but it was easier for me to eschew food completely for the day rather 
than have small portions. I fasted on Mon, Wed &amp; Fridays every week and 
allowed myself anything I wanted on the other 4 days. I don&rsquo;t have any 
bloodwork from then, but I did lose a lot of weight and after a bit I actually 
enjoyed the fasting. Once I went for 3 days without eating just for yuks and it 
was totally fine with me.</p> 
<p>BUT! The late Dr. Atkins claimed that you had to stoke your metabolic

His opinion has prevented me from skipping meals. The idea being to keep your 
blood sugar on an even keel and not spiky.</p>

<p>Hi Laurel&ndash;</p> 
<p>The idea that you have to keep your metabolic furnace stoked is a myth. 
Look back over the last few comments as I discussed more fully what happens to 
blood sugar during a fast and how the metabolic rate is set.</p>

<p>Thanks for the post, Dr Eades, and thanks for answering so many emails. If 
you have stopped doing so before getting to this my feelings won&rsquo;t be 
hurt, but in case you still are, I have a question about water weight. I 
started IF (after the pattern you suggested) on Monday&ndash;didn&rsquo;t weigh 
until Tuesday morning. Since then I&rsquo;m down about three pounds, which is 
surprising, since I&rsquo;m certain that in my case this has resulted in a 
great decrease in calories. (Also in a significant decrease in carbs, although 
I was going from low-carb TO low-carb.) Normally I would expect a larger 
initial weight loss from such a change (due to water loss), and was curious to 
know if the body might react differently to caloric/carb reductions with THIS 
pattern of eating as opposed to similar reductions with &ldquo;regular&rdquo; 
eating. (By the way, I had a murderous problem with late night binging, even on 
low carb&ndash;it was as if a false bottom dropped out of stomach between 8 and 
10 PM&ndash;and that problem is instant history.)</p> 
<p>Hi Michael&ndash;</p> 
<p>If you had been on a low-carb diet previously for any length of time, then 
I would imagine that your insulin sensitivity had already improved. It&rsquo;s 
the almost immediate increase in insulin sensitivity when switching to a 
low-carb diet from a high-carb diet that causes the water loss. A switch from a 
low-carb to a little lower probably won&rsquo;t make the same difference.</p> 
<p>I&rsquo;m glad you&rsquo;ve conquered the late night binge demon.</p>

<p>Dr. Mike,<br>
 I&rsquo;ve read your article, and some of the posts 
following the article. I&rsquo;m thinking of giving this a try, with a 
(hopefully) minor variation. Here&rsquo;s the schedule I came up with:</p> 
<p>Weekly schedule:<br>
 Saturday: LC lifestyle, eat 3 LC meals<br>
 Sunday: 
IF lifestyle, no food after 8 pm (eat Bfast, Lunch, Dinner before 8pm)<br>
 
Monday: IF lifestyle, no food before 6 pm (eat Dinner after 6pm)<br>
 Tuesday: 
IF lifestyle, no food after 8 pm (eat Bfast, Lunch, Dinner)<br>
 Wednesday: IF 
lifestyle, no food before 6 pm (eat Dinner)<br>
 Thursday: IF lifestyle, no 
food after 8 pm (eat Bfast, Lunch, Dinner)<br>
 Friday: IF lifestyle, no food 
before 6 pm (eat Dinner)</p> 
<p>The reason the &ldquo;no food&rdquo; IF days end at 6 pm instead of 8 pm is 
to allow a family dinner with the little one before her bedtime. Basically, 
this schedule allows our family to maintain a 6 to 6:30 &ldquo;dinner 
time&rdquo; every day. And by making Saturday a LC day I don&rsquo;t disrupt 
the families meals then either (we&rsquo;re already used to me eating LC while 
other family members have whatever). I also like this because my IFing fast 
days are all work days (M, W, F) when I&rsquo;ll be mentally engaged in other 
activities and therefore (maybe?) not so focused on the fact that I&rsquo;m not 
eating.</p> 
<p>I&rsquo;m going to start this tomorrow (Saturday), and I&rsquo;d appreciate 
any comments, guidance, or good jokes you may have.</p> 
<p>And a couple of specific question:<br>
 1) What would you say to a glass of 
wine during my &ldquo;no food&rdquo; evenings? I&rsquo;ve found I can sip on a 
single glass for several hours in the evening.<br>
 2) What about chai tea made 
with either cream or 1% milk? Same thing in that I can sip on a large mug of 
hot chai for several hours. (Sweetened with Stevia).</p> 
<p>Both seem to eliminate my evening snacking problem quite effectively. </p> 
<p>Thanks and regards,<br>
 Dan</p> 
<p>Hi Dan&ndash;</p> 
<p>Since there are no rigidly set rules, you can pretty much set it up however 
works best with your lifestyle. The important thing is to have a single, long 
period of time without food intake. I don&rsquo;t know how the wine or Chai 
would fit in. The best thing to do it try it both ways and let us all know how 
it works for you.</p>

<p>This came from Dr. Hymans&rsquo;s &ldquo;Ultrametabolism&rdquo; Book. It is 
the oposite of what you are stating and what we hear most of the time. Although 
when I eat breakfast it is like opening the flood gates and I am starving all 
day lone. Linda</p> 
<p> It&rsquo;s Dr. Hyman again with your next installment of the mini-<br>
 
course titled:</p> 
<p> &ldquo;How To Reset Your Metabolism to Lose The Weight and Keep It<br>
 
Off For Life&rdquo;</p> 
<p> Today, I&rsquo;ll explain how sumo wrestlers gain so much<br>
 
weight&hellip; And I&rsquo;ll show you why you may be on the VERY SAME<br>
 
diet that sumo wrestlers use to gain hundreds of pounds!</p> 
<p> And of course, most importantly, what you can do to stop<br>
 eating like 
a sumo wrestler and start eating what your body<br>
 was designed to eat.</p> 
<p> ==&gt; The Sumo Wrestler Myth</p> 
<p> Have you ever wondered how sumo wrestlers gain so much<br>
 weight?</p> 
<p> To understand how they do it, you need to first understand<br>
 how they 
live: They skip breakfast, exercise for about 5<br>
 hours, eat a huge meal, 
and then take a long nap.</p> 
<p> What&rsquo;s wrong with this picture?</p> 
<p> Nothing, if you&rsquo;re a sumo wrestler.</p> 
<p> The problem is, you&rsquo;re not, but you might be living like<br>
 one.
</p> 
<p> The typical routine of most Americans is startlingly similar<br>
 to that 
of a sumo wrestler: they skip breakfast, work all<br>
 day, come home to fill 
up on a big meal, and hit the sack<br>
 soon after.</p> 
<p> No wonder so many Americans are overweight or obese!</p> 
<p> There are two key behaviors in this routine that ensure that<br>
 
you&rsquo;ll gain weight, just like the Sumos:</p> 
<p> 1. When you skip breakfast, your body automatically goes<br>
 into 
starvation mode (which I explained in an earlier<br>
 lesson). This makes your 
body store as much fat as<br>
 possible, instead of burning it. And it also 
keeps you<br>
 hungry, so you gorge on as much food as possible later in<br>
 
the day. That adds up to more food than you would have eaten<br>
 if you had 3 
or 4 smaller meals.</p> 
<p> 2. You eat too close to bedtime. Eating right before you<br>
 sleep 
practically guarantees that you&rsquo;ll gain weight because<br>
 when you go 
to sleep with food still in your stomach, your<br>
 body automatically stores 
the food as fat and burns less of<br>
 it.</p> 
<p> What&rsquo;s the message here? Don&rsquo;t eat within 3 hours of your<br>
 
bedtime.</p> 
<p> Here are other tips for avoiding sumo-size weight gain:</p> 
<p> &ndash; Eat breakfast. Make hearty, healthy breakfasts a habit.<br>
 
Filling up early helps keep your appetite in check all day<br>
 long and revs 
up your resting metabolic rate, so you burn<br>
 fat all day long.</p> 
<p> &ndash; Eat 3 or 4 more times during the day. Eating small,<br>
 healthy 
meals more frequently continues to keep your<br>
 appetite under control, and 
gives you the energy you need to<br>
 motor through your day.</p> 
<p> &ndash; Avoid eating within a few hours before bedtime. Leaving<br>
 time 
for your body to digest ensures that the food you eat<br>
 will be burned 
rather than stored as fat.</p> 
<p> (You&rsquo;ll find more details on the Sumo Wrestler Myth in<br>
 Chapter 
5 of UltraMetabolism.)</p>

<p>Hi Linda&ndash;</p> 
<p>Dr. Hyman needs to do a little more research on the Sumo wrestlers before 
he makes the ignorant pronouncements that he does.</p> 
<p>Here is a link to the PDF of an American Journal of Clinical Nutrition 
article written by Japanese researchers on the diet of Sumo wrestlers.</p> 
<p>http://www.ajcn.org/cgi/reprint/29/10/1167</p> 
<p>If you read it you will find the the class of Sumo wrestlers in training 
for the big time eat over 5000 kcal per day composed of over 1000 grams of 
carbohydrate and only 50 grams of fat. These wrestlers eat huge high-carb meals 
twice per day. Doesn&rsquo;t look like much of an IF to me.</p>

<p>I have fiddled with the low carb idea (and practice) since the early 
sixties when chance led me to a book presentation in London by Dr. Richard 
Mackarness. It opened my eyes and I have rarely strayed from the basic premise 
of Banting&rsquo;s regimen (Eat Fat, Grow Slim)</p> 
<p>Having been educated in the Fatherland, I was also exposed to various 
natural &ldquo;cures&rdquo; such as fasting. So, it came quite naturally that I 
would experiment with the two in tandem.</p> 
<p>I plan to do a strict one day fasting, next day low carb eating for 12 
weeks just to see what it will do and lose the few pounds that I recently put 
on as a result of a major stress (no, not illness).I also run long distance 
including marathons (all on bare feet, incidentally) and do fine with the very 
low carb intake.</p> 
<p>I have no results as yet but will let you know if anyone is interested.</p>

<p>Hi Dr. Mike,<br>
 I&rsquo;ve been practicing IF for six weeks, after a 
friend on my master&rsquo;s swim team mentioned he&rsquo;d been doing it for 
three years (he&rsquo;d read about the rat study and just decided to try it to 
prevent his aging bio-markers from going up). I fast every other day, for a 
total of 36 hours. So far, I&rsquo;ve lost 11 pounds and my BMI is 22. The 
hardest part for me is going to bed hungry so I sometimes break the fast a 
little before bed by eating a handful of raw almonds or a bit of cheese or half 
of an avocado, something low carb of approx. 250 calories. This helps me sleep; 
otherwise, I toss and turn. I exercise 6 mornings a week (4 days of 90-min. 
swimming and 2 days of 90-min weights) and have found no difference in 
performance, though sometimes I feel a bit weaker on the morning after a 
fasting day (I do eat before working out but it takes a while for the food to 
give me some energy, I can actually feel it kicking in about half way through a 
workout).</p> 
<p>I have really enjoyed the self-knowledge I&rsquo;ve gained from going 
without food several days a week. I have learned how I use food to cope with 
stress and emotions. I&rsquo;ve learned what hunger really feels like and how 
to delay gratification and it&rsquo;s been eye-opening to find out how much 
time I spend planning meals, preparing them, eating them, etc&hellip; On my 
fasting days, I have so much more time. It has been a powerful series of 
lessons; in fact, empowered is a great way to describe how I view myself now.
</p> 
<p>There have been physical benefits, as well. In addition to losing the 
weight (I&rsquo;d like to lose about 8 more pounds), on my fasting days I 
often, but not always, have increased mental clarity and well-being. I feel 
less anxious, more centered, calmer and much more detail-oriented. My focus is 
greatly improved in the late afternoon. I also immediately noticed after 
starting this eating plan that I had improved sensory perceptions, including a 
greatly increased sense of smell and hearing. Colors also look brighter and 
more vivid, though, alas, I still need my contact lenses. I find myself 
completely turned off by television; something about the flashing, flickering 
screen and the noise is now unappealing. My skin has a healthy glow and it 
sometimes feels on fasting days like I have a slight fever, as if my body were 
cleaning house. These feelings carry over to my eating days. I&rsquo;ve never 
been on anti-depression drugs or Attention Deficit medication, but it really 
almost feels almost like combination of what those two drugs would do.</p> 
<p>Anyway, thanks for your information. It&rsquo;s been interesting reading 
people&rsquo;s responses. I will probably continue the 36-hour fasting until I 
hit my goal weight and then switch to 24-hour fasting every other day (eating 
dinner every night).</p>

<p>I started this later than some, last weekend, and am easing in gently with 
the &ldquo;wimpy&rdquo; approach Laub et al described: 20-50% cals one day 
(eating one, two or three times, depending on my day), ad lib the other. So far 
I&rsquo;ve felt pretty hungry on the low cal days, but not impossibly so. I 
suspect I&rsquo;m not quite eating enough to compensate on the ad lib days 
&ndash; but it&rsquo;s been less than a week so although my weight is down a 
tad, it&rsquo;s too soon to say if that&rsquo;s real. I don&rsquo;t want to 
lose weight (I&rsquo;m about 22% BF and quite happy there), so I&rsquo;d like 
to keep the cals up. It feels as if my allergic rhinitis is slightly less on 
the low cal days, but not on the ad lib ones so far.</p>

<p>I have seen no data on the IF used in pregnant women. I wouldn&rsquo;t 
think it would be a problem while you&rsquo;re trying, but once you are

<p>Count me in as one trying this approach with a slight modification. 
I&rsquo;m eating a full meal at or before 6 pm on my non-fasting days. That may 
change soon depending on my results, but so far, I&rsquo;ve dropped from 202 
lbs to 195, and I hadn&rsquo;t been able to make the scale budge in several 
weeks previously.</p> 
<p>I just happened to stumble onto this because I was fasting out of 
frustration with my digestive problems last week. Once I read this article and 
some others like it, I broke my fast at 32 hours and went this direction. 
I&rsquo;m experiencing reduced allergy and digestive problems using IF, and 
I&rsquo;m not experiencing any major energy problems other than a desire to 
sleep earlier than normal on my fasting days.</p>

<p>Hi Lisa&ndash;</p> 
<p>I have never treated a patient with Dercum&rsquo;s disease, so have no 
experience as to whether a low-carb diet or an IF regimen would help. Since it 
is the fatty tissue that is painful in this disorder, it would seem to make 
sense to reduce the amount of such tissue. Also, I can&rsquo;t imagine there 
not being an inflammatory component, and, since the IF (and the LC diet too, 
for that matter) reduce inflammation, it may help in that regard. If you do 
choose to try the IF, please let me know how it goes.</p>

<p>Hi Dr. Eades,<br>
 I was wondering if you have any information on IF and 
metabolism? I have always heard that eating 5 or so small meals a day would 
keep your metabolism high and that skipping meals would slow it down. I have 
never tried the 5 meals a day approach, actually my metabolism always seemed 
pretty good &ndash; I was able to eat basically what I wanted and if I needed 
to lose a little weight it wasn&rsquo;t very hard until I turned 40 or 
thereabouts I noticed it wasn&rsquo;t as easy to lose that extra weight. I 
started IF two weeks ago not really to lose weight but more for the health 
benefits that I have read about &ndash; but I was hoping to drop 5 or so 
pounds. I don&rsquo;t think I am eating double the amount of calories on my eat 
days but I have not lost any weight &ndash; I have not gained any weight 
&ndash; just maintained. I am not overweight by standards that I have seen 
(5&rsquo;3&Prime;, 114 pds.) but like everyone I have a particular image that I 
would like to obtain. I work out approx. 4 days a week and eat what I consider 
a healthy diet. Do people sometimes reach a certain weight and no matter what 
you do it won&rsquo;t change? Anyway I was wondering if IF could be effecting 
my metabolism. Thanks in advance for your information. I very much enjoy 
reading this blog.</p> 
<p>Hi Misty&ndash;</p> 
<p>Metabolic rate is primarily a function of body weight. The contributions 
made by activity level and the thermic effect of food add to the total, but the 
largest component is determined by body weight alone. It makes no difference 
metabolically whether you eat many small meals or one large meal. What does 
make a difference is the composition of the meals. There are some interesting 
studies showing that, in women, at least, increased protein intake brought 
about significant weight loss. I don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re eating when 
you eat, but you might want to crank up your protein intake a bit.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m experimenting with IF (by eating an early supper and then 
skipping breakfast, so I&rsquo;m going 18 hours without eating). I find that 
when I do eat, I don&rsquo;t eat more than usual to make up for my skipped 
breakfast. I&rsquo;m also more aware of eating only when hungry. This is a big 
realization for me. I would eat because it was mealtime.</p> 
<p>It seems to me that if you do IF, you end up doing some CR also. when you 
do IF, do you end up eating the same number of calories overall? I don&rsquo;t.
</p> 
<p>When you become a 2nd Initiate in the religion I belong to, it is 
recommended that you fast on Fridays &ndash; a full fast, a partial fast or a 
mental fast. I was doing the mental fasts but decided to do a food fast. I was 
thinking of eating at 6 pm but wasn&rsquo;t that hungry and I couldn&rsquo;t 
decide what to eat so I decided to just skip supper and wait until the next 
morning to eat. I had difficulty sleeping that night. is this common?</p> 
<p>If one just eats 2 meals/day instead of 3 meals/day, without those 2 meals 
being larger than before, you&rsquo;ve just cut your calories by one third. 
Seems like an easy way to do CR. Eating very LC (which I do) makes it easier to 
skip meals and/or to fast.</p> 
<p>Hi Carolyn&ndash;</p> 
<p>Unless one doubles up on caloric intake on eat days, one definitely does 
CR. No question about it.</p> 
<p>As I&rsquo;ve mentioned before, I don&rsquo;t think there is any magic 
number in terms of how long between eating, no one size fits all. But I do 
think that since the non-eating interval is what makes the thing work, it needs 
to be of significant length.</p>

<p>Today starts my third week of IF. I&rsquo;m doing it Warrior style so far, 
skipping BF and lunch. I have a two-hour eating window in the evening, and 
stick to relatively low carb eating. That gives me about 22 hours of fasting 
every day. I take one day off per week on the weekend, and eat lunch and 
dinner. (BF is never a good idea for me.)</p> 
<p>From day one, I have felt excellent! Lots of energy, clearer thinking, more 
focus, better stamina. A condition of numbness in my arms and hands has pretty 
much disappeared, and my neck, which has hurt for years, hurts much less and I 
can turn my head further.</p> 
<p>I love the freedom! Less planning, shopping, and preparing of food. Thus 
money, time, and effort savings. Also, I can go to work empty-handed, not 
packing food, and have my lunch break free to walk, read, knit, meditate, rest.
</p> 
<p>I&rsquo;m looking at IF as a permanent way of life. Can&rsquo;t think of 
any reason not to stick with it indefinitely.</p> 
<p>Oh &hellip; and I&rsquo;ve lost 7 lbs. in 2 weeks! I may just get to my 
goal weight yet!</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been practicing IF for about a month with good results &mdash; 
fasting BG is down about 10 pts. overall and the spikes are not as high. Thanks 
for the &ldquo;push&rdquo; to get going on this. Wanted to let you know about a 
great article in today&rsquo;s Timesonline, if you haven&rsquo;t seen it &mdash;
http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,8126-1707912_1,00.html It doesn&rsquo;t 
name the WOE as IF, but that&rsquo;s what it really is.</p>

<p>Dr. Eades,</p> 
<p>Have been doing IF for about a month now with good results, but have just 
found out that I have laryngeal edema, probably caused by laryngopharyngeal 
(acid) reflux. Several inconvenient things are supposed to be bad for this 
condition, including large meals, high protein, and high fat. (Although the ENT 
doctor I saw did not touch on any of those items.) Do you know of anything 
about IF research that would indicate that it MIGHT have any ADVANTAGES for 
this condition, and do you have any suggestions on what avenues I might go down 
to research it? (I&rsquo;ve been prescribed Nexium, for which I subbed Prilosec 
on account of &ldquo;poverty.&rdquo; Many thanks again for your blog and for 
your many replies to all of us.</p> 
<p>Hi Michael&ndash;</p> 
<p>Take a look at this post on gastroesophageal reflux I wrote about a year 
ago. It should answer a lot of your questions.I</p> 
<p>don&rsquo;t have any experience with patients on IF regimens and GERD, but 
I do have a ton of experience with patients on low-carb diets, which work like 
a charm.</p>

<p>a group of Finnish low carbers have tested IF for a while. Do you have 
questions that you would like me to ask in a questionnaire?</p>

 hoover</p> 
<p>Hi Hoover&ndash;</p> 
<p>Yes, please.&nbsp; Ask how much weight was lost on average and when.&nbsp; 
Did most people lose early on and then slow down as the IF progressed or did 
they lose about the same throughout or not much at first, then more later on?
</p> 
<p>Also ask what were the main problems, if any, that people experienced.</p> 
<p>How long was the IF?</p> 
<p>Did people follow a low-carb diet on their eating days?</p> 
<p>Did people following the IF think (or know if) they ate fewer calories 
overall during the IF?</p> 
<p>How did people do the IF?&nbsp; Fast every other day? Fast 6 PM until 6 PM 
the next day?&nbsp; Did they eat anything at all on the fast days?</p> 
<p>I will be extremely curious to hear the answers.&nbsp; Thanks for helping.

<p>Greetings Dr. Meades,<br>
 I did alot of researching CR/IF over the summer 
by reading as much as I could on the web. The first of Sept &rsquo;06 I started 
my own version of the IF diet. On my fast day I allow myself all the fruit or 
vegetables (low glycemic) I want and keep my calorie intake below 500. I often 
don&rsquo;t eat at all but, if I want, I will have steamed broccoli and a few 
apples if I need something. Even a soy burger patty or small glass of skim milk 
for protein. As long as my calorie intake stays at or below 500 I consider it a 
fast day. On my eat days I tend to still eat fairly lightly but will eat pretty 
much whatever I want. I also will allow myself dinners on Friday &amp; Sat 
nites and fast during the daytime. My wife &amp; I enjoy fine dining and often 
go out on the weekends. I just watch what I order and don&rsquo;t overeat. I 
don&rsquo;t try to make up for my fast day and I don&rsquo;t allow myself to 
get stuffed. I&rsquo;ve lost 17 pounds since I started (202 down to 185)and 
have an amazing amount of energy. I&rsquo;m 46 and an ex-weightlifter (all 
natural, no drugs) so dieting is no stranger to me. I had to give up 
heavy-lifting due to some ulnar nerve damage. I ended up gaining weight and 
feeling lousy. Now I lift lighter and run 4 days a week along with the above 
diet and feel great. It&rsquo;s the easiest diet plan I&rsquo;ve ever done cos 
I eat whatever I want on my eat day&hellip;if I want cake, I&rsquo;ll have a 
piece and it makes no difference. I think I&rsquo;d have still lost a fair 
amount of weight even if I wasn&rsquo;t running. Thanks for sharing your ideas

<p>I have been fasting one day a week for the past two years because I know 
it&rsquo;s good for the body. And then I read about the intermittent fasting 
and started yesterday! I lost 3 lbs overnight drinking nothing but black coffee 
and water. (this surprised me as I am 5&rsquo;1 and 119 lbs but would like to 
get back down to 107) I am going to continue doing this to see how it goes and 
my husband will be joining me in this journey as well. Will this fasting 
&ndash; mixed with eating days of low carb and weight training for an hour 3 x 
a week and doing cardio for an hour 3x a week &ndash; help get rid of excess 
skin by any chance?</p> 
<p>Hi Sheyla&ndash;</p> 
<p>Glad to hear of your rapid success on the IF.&nbsp; Nothing like a little

<p>For those who are wondering about exercise and having energy while on a 
fasting day, let me tell you this:</p> 
<p>Today is my fasting day. I stopped eating at 4:45 last night &ndash; I 
don&rsquo;t like to eat too late at night. So after going without food for 16 
hours and drinking nothing but water and black coffee, I weight trained for an 
hour and I walked for 40 minutes (approx. 2 1/2 miles) with no problem and no 
energy crashes. Usually, weight training increaes my appetite. But this time 
there was no appetite. And I feel energized and rejuvenated after that workout! 
And this is with NO FOOD.</p> 
<p>On a side note, yesterday was my eating day. I ate approx. 75 g of carbs 
(which is high for me) and yet I maintained my 3 lb weight loss from Sunday 
into Monday.</p> 
<p>Wow. This is just amazing! I WISH I would have heard about this sooner. 
Thank God for low carb websites!</p>

<p>For the last year and a half, my wife and I have been encouraging people to 
try the &ldquo;primitive&rdquo; model of eating we call Fast-5 (A zero-calorie 
fast for 19 hours, then eat as desired for a 5 hour window, and one can go 
low-carb or not). I&rsquo;ve used this model on-and-off since 1996 and given 
the growing obesity crisis, wanted to share it. We have seen impressive 
results, including anti-inflammatory effects, and hope that the increasing 
familiarity with IF will eventually overwhelm current custom and cultural 
pressure to eat 3x a day. The biggest obstacles to once-daily eating are the 
social pressure to eat and the deeply ingrained dogma about breakfast (aka 
&ldquo;the breakfast myth&rdquo;) that appears to be the result of successful 
marketing tactics. Since some people like a book to go with their diet, I wrote 
one, but it&rsquo;s just as simple as you&rsquo;ve said. One of the nicest 
changes is that money goes into the dieter&rsquo;s pocket instead of some 
corporation&rsquo;s.<br>
 Whether one calls it Paleo, Warrior, Fast-5, or just 
&ldquo;once-a-day,&rdquo; the growing body of experience with it has to 
eventually overwhelm the uninformed &ldquo;it can&rsquo;t be healthy&rdquo; 
mainstream opinion.<br>
 It&rsquo;s still a bit of mystery to me why some form 
of IF hasn&rsquo;t shown up in big media outlets, such as on the &ldquo;Biggest 
Loser&rdquo; show. Even if it only spreads by word of mouth, it works so well 
for weight loss and weight maintenance, it will eventually be well-known.</p> 
<p>Hi Bert&ndash;</p> 
<p>Thanks for your input. It&rsquo;s great to hear from folks who have been 
following such a lifestyle for some time, and who have put their own twist on 
it.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m glad it&rsquo;s working for you.</p> 
<p>Let&rsquo;s hope that the growing body of experience ultimately overwhelms 
the uninformed mainstream opinion, but I&rsquo;m not holding my breath.</p>

that I am less and less hungry &ndash; on both eating and fasting days &ndash; 
as time goes by. I am making sure to keep my protein intake high on eating days.

<p>I started low carb 2.5 years ago in order to get my ravenous appetite under 
control and quit gaining weight (losing 60# has been a nice side benefit). I 
noticed recently that my appetite has again become an issue, although I only 
eat very low carb. I would force myself to eat within 30 min. of waking as I 
have read so many times suggested even though I was never particularly hungry, 
it seemed this would only stimulate my appetite and by evening I was on the 
constant prowl for food. I started not eating til 6pm and I have cut my daily 
quantity in half (or more) and I am no longer ravenous in the evening. I eat 
lots of eggs as a cheap easy protein source. Before I was eating 2 omelets a 
day, avocado/mayo/celery, ground flaxseed with 2 eggs &amp; cream cheese, can 
of sardines and go to bed hungry; now I eat 1 omelet at 6pm &amp; 
avocado/mayo/celery at 9pm and am satisfied. I have only been doing this for a 
week though.</p>

<p>Actually, to clarify, my concern is too much protein. I&rsquo;ve never had 
a concern about getting enough on a low carb diet. My concern is getting too 
much protein. I was reading a few articles yesterday that touched on Inuit 
societies and theirlargely fat-based diet&hellip;</p> 
<p>A related article (that I can&rsquo;t find now) warned against getting too 
much protein, and had suggestions for fat to protein ratios. It would be easier 
not to have to worry about too much. I can handle, &ldquo;eat a lot of 
that&rdquo;, but &ldquo;eat some of that, then eat something else with more fat 
because there&rsquo;s too much protein on that&hellip;&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t 
work well with me.</p> 
<p>It shouldn&rsquo;t be too hard, as I like fatty cuts of beef, for example. 
Just need to know if there is something to be concerned about, and if so, how 
much is too much.</p> 
<p>Hi Kevin&ndash;</p> 
<p>No, you don&rsquo;t need to worry about too much protein as long as you 
have normal kidney function.&nbsp; There are certain technical issues having to 
do with getting rid of urea, a product of protein metabolism, that supposedly 
sets the protein ceiling at 250 or so grams per day.&nbsp; Many bodybuilders 
consume way more than that day after day with no ill effects.&nbsp; The idea 
that we have to worry about getting too much protein is, in my opinion, a 
myth.&nbsp; As long as we eat whole food diets containing plenty of good 
quality fats, there shouldn&rsquo;t be a problem.</p>

<p>How many carbs do you recommend on eating days? And how many carbs or 
calories do you recommend when you break your 24 hour fast? And what do you 
recommend breaking the fast with-protein or vegetables? I&rsquo;ve always been 
told to break it with something on the light side. Is this really a necessity? 
It seems I could get away with eating higher carbs on eating days if I am doing 
24 on, 24 off -as long as it averages out to the right amount of carbs for me 
to be able to maintain my weight.</p> 
<p>Hi Australya&ndash;</p> 
<p>We&rsquo;re not talking about a major fast here; we&rsquo;re talking about 
24 hours.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t think it matters what you break it with.</p> 
<p>As to carbs and proteins, I don&rsquo;t have any recommendations for them 
on the IF other than to get plenty of protein on eating days.&nbsp; Plenty of 
protein is at least 0.6 gms per pound of body weight for someone with normal 
activity levels.&nbsp; The reason I posted on the IF is that it is a method 
that permits more carb consumption yet provides many of the benefits of carb 
restriction.&nbsp; Optimally, one would continue to restrict carbs to under 50 
gms per day on eating days, but it&rsquo;s not necessary to get plenty of 
benefit from the program.</p>

<p>Forgive me if this ? was already asked and answered but I didn&rsquo;t see 
it anywhere or I missed it.</p> 
<p>On fasting days, how many calories and carbs should you allow yourself when 
you break the fast? I know it shouldn&rsquo;t be an all out feast, but is there 
a limit to how much so you don&rsquo;t lose any of the benefits of the 24 hours 
of fasting?</p> 
<p>Hi Sheyla&ndash;</p> 
<p>There isn&rsquo;t a limit.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s the point of the intermittent 
fast.&nbsp; If you go without for one day, you can make up for it on the 
next.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s the long period of having no food that provides the 
health benefits.&nbsp; If you want to maximize the good gained from the IF, I 
would recommend that on the eat days a low-carb diet be followed.&nbsp; But 
don&rsquo;t worry about the calories.</p>

<p>I also advocate the Warrior Diet ideal, though I fully fast through the 
day, drinking coffee or water as wanted. And while Hokmekler(of the WD) did not 
advocate the low-carb approach, his diet does say to restrict the 
&ldquo;bad&rdquo; carbs, like flour(so he is pro quality carb and foods). But I 
write here today, because I wanted to say that in the diet book &ldquo;The 
Carbohydrate Addicts Diet&rdquo; by Rachael Heller, and her husband Richard, in 
Rachael&rsquo;s introduction, she states she lost all her excess weight, over 
100 lbs, by fasting all day, and eating what she wanted in the evening, as her 
dinner meal. This idea of daily fasting, is also supported by Dr. 
Mericle&rsquo;s site, about the need to be in the glucagon state to lose 
weight, and how fasting is actually the increasing of metabolism. Interesting 
stuff.</p>

<p>Dr. Eades,</p> 
<p>I&rsquo;ve just finished my first 5 weeks on IF, doing a Warrior Diet-style 
approach where I eat every night in a 2-4-hour window, then fast until the 
following evening.</p> 
<p>I&rsquo;ve lost pretty consistently, averaging about 1.5 lbs per week for a 
total of 7.5 lbs so far. After the first week where I was pretty ravenous by 
the time dinner came each night, I now have to work hard to get ENOUGH calories 
and protein (using nutrition-tracking software), since I&rsquo;m satisfied with 
just a normal meal for dinner.</p> 
<p>Of course it&rsquo;s nice not having to think about food during the day, or 
having to spend $7 or $8 or more on lunch out every day, and while the weight 
loss is nice as well, I was also losing when just following Protein Power 
normally (I still restrict my carbs and make sure I get my minimum protein 
according to PP every day while on IF). But what I&rsquo;ve found is most 
striking is that my energy has increased tremendously. I would credit this 
somewhat to weight loss, but even after a couple of weeks and a couple of lbs, 
I had a lot more energy.</p> 
<p>In all, it&rsquo;s been a great experience and I thank you for bringing it 
to my (and many other readers&rsquo;) attention!</p>

<p>Dr. Eades,</p> 
<p>when I do an IF I find that I need a lot of coffee to get me through the 
fasting portion of things. Is this something to be worried about? My concern is 
the insulin resistance that comes along with chronic use of caffeine.</p> 
<p>When I break the fast I generally have a heavy resistancing training 
session and then have a meal of mixed pro/carbs/fat all whole foods and then I 
go back to low-carbs meals for the remaining eat phase till the 6pm fast. If 
I&rsquo;m insulin resist from all the caffeine I&rsquo;m wondering if the carbs 
port workout are going to be stored as fat versus filling up my muscles and 
aiding in my recovery from the heavy lifting.</p> 
<p>Finally your IF setup calls for eating till 6pm but most of the posters 
seem to discuss eating dinner/breakfast/lunch. I&rsquo;ve been doing:</p> 
<p>[dinner|breakfast|lunch|small dinner just b4 6pm|fast till 6pm next day]</p>
<p>this Ok from your point of view?</p> 
<p>thanks!</p> 
<p><em>Hi Fred&ndash;</em></p> 
<p><em>There is no evidence that I&rsquo;m aware of that implicates coffee as 
a cause of insulin resistance.&nbsp; In fact, the preponderance of the data 
seems to indicate that coffee is protective against diabetes, insulin 
resistance and all the rest of the so-called diseases of civilization.&nbsp; I 
drink loads of it all the time, so if that&rsquo;s what it takes to get you 
through the fasting days, I would say that the data says, go for it.&nbsp; And 
don&rsquo;t worry about it with resistance training.&nbsp; Some studies have 
shown that coffee even improves that.<br>

<p>This article might be of interest to the fasters.</p> 
<p>We&rsquo;re on Day 4 of our program, where we just skip breakfast and lunch 
every other day (KISS ). The second fast day was much easier than the first. I 
got a little sketchy around lunch, but was otherwise fine. We used the time 
that otherwise would have been spent on meals to hit the gym.</p> 
<p>I&rsquo;ve noticed a couple of things, and will be curious to see if they 
continue. First and foremost, when we do eat, we eat a LOT less and feel 
stuffed. I&rsquo;m probably eating 75% or less of what I would typically have 
for dinner, and today (which is an eating day) felt no urge to eat lunch. My 
wife reports that on fast days, she can have a very small snack (like a slice 
of salami) and get through till dinner with flying colors. After dinner on the 
fast days, I got a massive surge of energy.</p> 
<p>I&rsquo;ve also lost 4 pounds, though I suspect that&rsquo;s mostly holiday 
carb binge induced water weight.</p>

<p>IF is something I&rsquo;ve been interested in for a while, and I&rsquo;ve 
followed this blog discussion since it began. I should also say that PP and 
PPLP did a lot to convince me that the single most important thing that most of 
us can do for our health is to achieve insulin control. Carb restriction is the 
most intuitive way to achieve this, but it does seem that IF is a serious rival.
</p> 
<p>As I see it, every diet involves some kind of restriction or, if you 
prefer, *change* from the eating habits that feel spontaneous to us, and which 
made us fat. Maintaining the restriction, whatever form it takes, requires a 
kind of mental vigilance. If it&rsquo;s LC dieting, then one must be vigilant 
about carbs. IF requires vigilance about the *timing* of meals, rather than the 
amounts of food eaten or the ingredients.</p> 
<p>Long-term success depends upon what form of vigilance one can sustain. In 
this respect, IF has certain advantages. Mainly, there is this: There is (for 
me, anyway), a kind of psychological satisfaction that comes from having a meal 
that is *in no way* restricted, in terms of its actual content. The only 
restriction is in when you get to have it. But I realize that for some, there 
is more satisfaction in being able to eat *whenever* they want, even if what 
and how much they eat are restricted.</p> 
<p>A couple of comments and questions&hellip;</p> 
<p>1. Concerning &ldquo;metabolic slowdown&rdquo; you&rsquo;ve said that the 
main determinant of metabolic rate is lean body mass, I believe, since muscle 
is metabolically active tissue. This is true, but isn&rsquo;t it also true that 
the process of digestion itself, involving the hard-working smooth muscles of 
the GI tract, is pretty metabolically intensive? So during the 24 hours of 
fasting, these muscles would be getting more rest than usual, and that *would* 
amount to a somewhat reduced metabolic rate. The gut is &ldquo;expensive 
tissue,&rdquo; after all.</p> 
<p>2. During the fasting intervals, one would use stored glycogen and, 
eventually, glucose from amino acids for those tissues that need glucose. The 
chemical that the body uses to liberate glycogen and to initiate 
gluconeogenesis is the stress hormone cortisol, I think. So wouldn&rsquo;t IF 
tend to promote higher than usual cortisol levels during the fasting intervals, 
and is this a good thing?</p> 
<p><em>Hi Todd&ndash;</em></p> 
<p><em>Interesting point about different people having a 
&lsquo;preferred&rsquo; vigilance.&nbsp; Makes sense.&nbsp; Unfortunately, my 
vigilance is always greener on the other side of the fence.&nbsp; If I&rsquo;m 
fasting, I want to eat all the time, but restrict my carbs.&nbsp; If I&rsquo;m 
low-carbing, I want to fast every other day and eat whatever I want.&nbsp; Most 
of the time, I just suck up and stick with the low-carb regimen, but I often go 
a long time between meals.&nbsp; And I never, ever eat between meals.</em></p> 
<p><em>As to your questions, first, metabolic rate isn&rsquo;t just muscle 
tissue, it is all tissue.&nbsp; The brain represents about 20% of the metabolic 
rate irrespective of whether one is eating or not.&nbsp; Most of the 
organs&ndash;liver, kidney, lungs, heart, and all the rest&ndash;work on doing 
their jobs no matter what the state of eating is.&nbsp; Even during fasting 
times, the GI tract has to deal with the food that was eaten earlier, and even 
if no food is there, the GI tract deals with the vast biomass of bacteria that 
live there and work with us synergistically.&nbsp; The GI tract itself is not 
particularly &lsquo;expensive tissue.&rsquo; Current thinking is that during 
evolutionary times the size of the GI tract was sacrificed to release energy 
for the much more &lsquo;expensive&rsquo; large human brain.</em></p> 
<p><em>An old researcher named Max Kleiber who wrote a famous book called 
&lsquo;The Fire of Life&rsquo; back in the 60s figured out that metabolic rates 
throughout and within species was a function of body weight.&nbsp; A sheep that 
weighs as much as a human has pretty much the same metabolic rate.&nbsp; If you 
break that metabolic rate down to the individual metabolic rates of all the 
body components, you find that the sheep heart and the human heart both consume 
about the same energy.&nbsp; Same for the kidneys and most of the other 
organs.&nbsp; The difference is found in the brains and GI tracts.&nbsp; Sheep 
have extremely large, complex GI tracts that consume a lot of energy and small 
brains that don&rsquo;t use much.&nbsp; Humans are just the opposite.&nbsp; The 
thinking is that as we evolved larger brains something had to give, and what 
gave was the GI tract, which became smaller.&nbsp; A smaller, less complex GI 
tract needs foods (meat, for example) that is nutritionally dense and easily 
digestible.</em></p> 
<p><em>I don&rsquo;t know why I got launched off into all that, but the short 
answer is that fasting doesn&rsquo;t particularly cause a metabolic slowdown.
</em></p> 
<p><em>Second, most of the time during fasting, the hormone glucagon,which is 
the counter-regulatory hormone to insulin, drives gluconeogenesis, not the 
stress hormone cortisol.&nbsp;</em></p> 
<p><em>Hopes this answers your questions.</em></p>

<p>Thanks for the clarifications. It was precisely the Aiello/Wheeler 
&ldquo;expensive tissue hypothesis&rdquo; that I was thinking of, and the idea 
that the brain and gut in some sense were in &ldquo;competition&rdquo; for 
energy.</p> 
<p>Like others, I&rsquo;m interested in whether there will turn out to be much 
difference between daily IF (like thehttp://www.fast-5.com program), with a 4 
or 5 hour eating window, and the alternate-day (ADIF) system you describe. 
Another option is one meal a a day, consumed within a single hour. On one meal 
a day, one is fasting 23 out of every 24 hours, so the duration of fasting is 
similar to ADIF, but the total time fasting, over a period of a week, would be 
much greater.</p> 
<p>Let&rsquo;s see&hellip;there are 168 hours in a week. On ADIF there would 
be 4 intervals of 24-hour fasting, totalling 96 hours. With one meal a day 
there would be 7 hours of eating and the remaining 161 would be fasting. Of 
course, even on ADIF there are the sleep intervals, but since they are 
relatively short I don&rsquo;t count them as true fasting intervals.</p> 
<p>The question is: Is an hour a day of eating enough? It would have to be 
true gorging, a Falstaffian meal of calorically dense food. But that seems 
doable. In a previous life (okay, a month ago), I could easily eat an entire 
pizza all by myself. I&rsquo;m not suggesting that this would be the way to do 
IF, but just as a demo: A single slice of Pizza Hut Sicilian Lasagne Pizza is 
310 kcals. Eight slices, the whole pie, would then be 2480 kcals. That would do 
it. A better option would be based on fatty meat, etc.</p> 
<p>Thus, on this plan, the length of any given fast would be just an hour less 
than on the ADIF plan, but the number of fasts would be greater.</p>

<p>I have only tried IF a handful of times over the past 2 years. I can handle 
the on/off eating requirement. The only problem I constantly encounter are the 
friends and family members that think I am crazy for doing this. I try to 
explain all the benefits and have only recently started sending them URLs like 
this web page and abstracts from PubMed.</p> 
<p>I have had to repeat myself many times that it is not open for debate but 
many people in my life they seem to think that it will only make me 
malnourished and unhealthy.</p> 
<p>They can&rsquo;t dispute the years of positive data in the mice studies but 
again they think I am crazy assuming it will also work in humans.</p> 
<p>The point of me writing to you is how can I easily make this life change 
when everyone else in the world lives with the concept that 3 meals per day is 
the only way.</p> 
<p>People feel as if I am forcing a new religion down their throats.</p> 
<p>Any advice is appreciated,<br>

<p>A few things here.</p> 
<p>A whole Pizza Hut Sicilian Lasagna Pizza? I can&rsquo;t even imagine eating 
a whole pizza hut pie. I find as mentioned above that I feel full a lot sooner 
than I would otherwise. But now that you&rsquo;ve mentioned PH, I&rsquo;m 
really in the mood.</p> 
<p>As for the rest of the world, I tend not to tell them much either. I spent 
a week with the parents over the holidays. I was doing &ldquo;dinner 
only&rdquo; style of IF. I just sort of avoided the early meals. Talked a bit 
about the concept with my roommate, who runs triathlons. Promptly got the 
assault of, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s dangerous, have you tried eating 6 small meals? 
That&rsquo;s anorexia, yada yada&rdquo;.</p> 
<p>Researching this topic has demonstrated, even more than when I started a 
low carb style of eating, that people develop very strong dietary beliefs, will 
argue them to exhaustion, and rarely have any scientific basis for those 
beliefs. Myself included. Every few days I find myself trolling google to make 
sure my muscles aren&rsquo;t going to disappear.</p> 
<p>Thanks for the personal replies. Much appreciated. Also glad I&rsquo;m not 
the only one who guzzles coffee.</p> 
<p>Speaking of coffee, I find while fasting I need to cut back. The effect is 
stronger. While this makes logical sense, I&rsquo;m wondering if anybody had 
the same reaction?</p>

<p>Hello Doctor,</p> 
<p>I think that it is great that you get around to answering questions and 
responding to comments here. Thank you very much for your time.</p> 
<p>Anyway, I have been reading a lot of the comments here although I have only 
got around to about half of them. So I don&rsquo;t know if anyone has asked 
this question or if you have discussed it, I apologize for being redundant if 
you have. But how do you feel about extended periods of fasting? I would love 
to start an IF program but I&rsquo;m just looking for a jumpstart. I like 
instant gratification (as do most people) and I have a significant amount of 
weight to lose. I know that fasting has been a good way to jumpstart my weight 
loss. I am thinking about 20 days of a juice fast and then getting into a 
regular IF routine. ????</p> 
<p>By the way, I already know that the IFing would work for me. When I was at 
my thinnest, I was doing a form of it without even realizing. I would either 
eat once or sometimes twice a day but pretty small meals and I&rsquo;d never 
snack. I always knew that was what worked for me. But I ignored that fact as I 
got older and took dieting advice from others. Of course, it was all the same- 
eat 5 or 6 small meals a day. It never worked! Go figure.</p> 
<p>Thank you for your time</p> 
<p><em>Hi Vanessa&ndash;</em></p> 
<p><em>I would not recommend a 20 day juice fast because juice contains no 
protein and a whole lot of sugar.&nbsp; You would lose weight, but much of it 
would be lean body mass, which you really don&rsquo;t want to lose.&nbsp; And, 
the sugar in the juice would continue to stimulate insulin release.&nbsp; If 
you undertook the IF and chose to eat extremely low-carb on your eating days, I 
think you would have more success.</em></p>

<p>Ok. Thank you for the response! I am quite stubborn and may do a little 
juice fasting despite your advice but I will certainly let you know how things 
go once I start my IF routine. One thing that may pose a problem with the low 
carbing- I don&rsquo;t care to eat much meat. Is it possible to do a low 
carb/high protein diet by using mostly fruits and vegetables (low glycemic of 
course)? Also, I definitely would enjoy drinking calorie free soda and drinks 
on my fasting days. However, isn&rsquo;t it true that artificial sweetners are 
metabolized in the same way that pure sugar is? That would therefore negate 
some of the positive effects of fasting, no?</p> 
<p>One last thing: I have a friend that suffers from IBS. Would IF help her at 
all with her condition? I don&rsquo;t know what all IBS entails but it seems 
like IF has helped with many other problems, I was just curious on what she may 
be able to do.</p> 
<p>Thanks again so much!</p>

<p>Intermittent fasting is the way to go. I work a busy schedule and have 
always been health conscious. I began calorie restricion about 10 years ago, 
about the same time I heard about Dr. Roy Walford and the failed Biosphere 
experiment. I was fascinated, and over the the years had become very calorie 
restrictive, but I was eating every day. Then early last year I went through a 
difficult period in my life, I just fell off the wagon, food-wise. I began 
binging at all-u-can-eat buffets and really let myself go physically. It was 
just so hard to eat restrictive every day for me after, I&rsquo;d start good 
then by the end of the day I gorged. I put on the pounds too and lost my 
&ldquo;washboard&rdquo; abs. Then I read about intermittent fasting, the QOD 
Diet, the Warrior Diet, etc&hellip; I started eating every 3 days, the only 
nourishment I gave myself was post resistance training in the morning, a scoop 
of multi-purpose protein, a tablespoon of dextrose, a tablespoon of unsweetened 
cocoa powder, a taplespoon of coffee grinds and a tablespoon of cinnamon. This 
I would bascially drink down immediately after my workout. All I can say is 
this &ndash; I feel better than I ever have in my short (33 years) life. I have 
more energy on fasting days, I have my 8-pack abs back and did not lose very 
much muscle either, which surprised me a great deal because whenever dieting I 
would always lose a significant amount of muscle mass. I am 5&prime; 10&Prime;, 
weight 175 lbs, I carry between 4 &ndash; 6% body fat and am often mistaken for 
being much younger. I get the &ldquo;do you go to college&rdquo; question all 
the time. I attribute my youthful appearance and physical health to calorie 
restriction and a very heavy dependance on vitamin and nutrititional 
supplements. You name it, I take it. I spend about $3-4K per year on 
anti-oxidants, phyto-chemicals, resveratol supplements, coral calcium, 
b-complex, hyaluronic acid, etc&hellip; Often when I discuss my lifestyle with 
people they criticze it and tell me I may be hurting myself. Well if my annual 
physical has any relevance, let me let it be known EVERYTHING always comes back 
perfect, I get a very excellent grade by my doctor. I never discuss my 
lifestyle with him because I don&rsquo;t want to scare him I work out with 
weights every morning, only taking Sunday off (Sabbath), I swim laps Monday and 
Wednesday nights and bike, treamdil, or some other physical activity on Friday 
and Sunday (softball after church Sunday). The people who generally criticize 
me and make the biggest deal are usually the people who are the most unfit, 
smokers, obese people, etc. I don&rsquo;t care what anyone says, it works for 
me and I hope I live to be 150! At this rate, I believe I&rsquo;m on the 
correct path to doing just that :}~</p>

<p>Hello,<br>
 Just a quick comment: I have been doing 18 or 20 hr fasting for 
a couple years. I started with the WD then went to Lunch and dinner in a 6 hr 
window. Recently I switched to a small breakfast and a larger lunch and skip 
the dinner. My question is whether or not there is any advantage to the body in 
terms of eating at a certain time of the day? I have always heard that eating 
your larger meal early in the day was more healthful&hellip;is there any truth 
to that, or is it another myth??<br>
 I changed to breakfast and lunch because 
I have more of a tendency to cheat on carbs at the end of a stressful day! (I 
am a medical student and have a family to boot!)</p>

<p>I just came across this idea a couple days ago. I have done two days of the 
24 hour fast every other day. I find this easy to do which shocks me.</p> 
<p>I am diabetic on Byetta (unable to tolerate Glucophage) I have always had 
great luck reducing blood sugars with low carb but the uric acid kidney stones 
has made it more difficult.</p> 
<p>Today&rsquo;s after supper blood sugar is 130, great results for me. I hope 
to continue the intermittent fasting and make it part of my overall plan. 
Spending every other day drinking without eating, I hope, will help decrease 
overall kidney stone risk along with the alkalizers I use.</p> 
<p>I have also been interested in using one of Dr. Bernstein&rsquo;s 
ideas&hellip;I read his article on his website regarding weekly rotation of 
various appetite suppressants herbal and/or prescription.

<p>Above, for shortened eating periods (e.g., eating only between 5 pm and 10 
pm), you advised getting at least 80 grams of protein, but I&#146;ve read that 
the body can only handle (for muscle and organ maintenance) about 15 to 20 
grams in a four-hour period. Does the latter rule not apply for a fasting

<p>Hello,</p> 
<p>Thank you for the wonderful description and explanation of this scientific 
fact.</p> 
<p>My husband and myself are on this kind of IF for already several months 
after several years on the Banta Diet. We were very successful on Banta but 
started being worried about missing many essential nutrients. So, after 
researching pretty much the same set of CR and IF articles and reviews, we 
worked out a simple eating schedule that suits us perfectly: one meal a day at 
7 PM.</p> 
<p>During this meal, we eat all we want quantitatively but we exclude refined 
carbohydrates and limit saturated fat though recent findings revealed that 
their bad role is overestimated. We exclude them just to be able to put in 
ourselves enough good protein and fats like fish, nuts, olive oil and tree nut 
oils.</p> 
<p>I calculated that we have negative calorie balance around 500 to 900 kcal a 
day but though we exercise at least 45 min. daily, walking, swimming, and 
working out with free weights, my stopped losing weight and I continue losing 
extremely slowly but weight loss is now not our major goal. I now manage my 
fibromyalgia very well and my husband is on his way to weaning from his anti 
seizure medication.</p> 
<p>This is just my 2 cents. Maybe somebody can benefit from our experience.</p>

<p>I would just like to say &ndash; for those who seemed to still be worried 
about your metabolism slowing down &ndash; it doesn&rsquo;t! Not for me anyway! 
When I first started fasting, I was lucky to lose even one pound in a day 
(that&rsquo;s how sluggish my metabolism was) And all I would consume on those 
days was black coffee and water. 2 years later, I can go on a fast of nothing 
but water and black coffee and I will drop 4 lbs overnight. Fasting sped up my 
metabolism- it didn&rsquo;t slow it down.</p>

<p>Above, during the fasting intervals you allow taking fish oil supplements. 
Is this because oil doesn&#146;t stimulate insulin production (although it 
might compete slightly with stored body fact as an energy source)? Two capsules 
= 40 calories.</p> 
<p>What about supplement fillers that include small amounts of carbs? Some of 
mine contain rice powder, for example, although no caloric content is indicated 
on the label. Should these be avoided during the fasting intervals?</p> 
<p>I&#146;m currently eating only during a five-hour window, from 5 pm to 10 
pm (a.k.a. &#147;Fast-five Diet&#148;). I eat a small meal at 5 pm just before 
leaving work. Dinner includes main course meat and fish or other animal protein 
in the salad. After increasing the protein as you recommend above, feel 
stronger and quicker by the day (do the PPLP sprints or squat-jumps some 
mornings).</p> 
<p>I also tried and liked alternate-day, 24-hour fasting, but figure my 
current protocol is more paleo-like. Your own low-carb, high-protein diet with 
sporadic skipped meals probably achieves equal effects. I personally like to 
include a few more carbs and regular IF may allow this. IF may seem a little 
less challenging to me as I did a couple Paavo Airola seven-day fasts a long 
time ago (Loren Cordain is familiar with Airola, the vegetarian health food 
advocate who died mysteriously.)</p> 
<p>Regarding the current drive (ignoring social encouragement) to eat several 
times during the day, for hunter-gatherers hunger probably would not have 
normally led to immediate food consumption, but rather to hunting or gathering, 
with built-in food consumption delays measured in hours or even days. So as 
regards the admonition to &ldquo;eat only when hungry&rdquo;, I add &ldquo;but

<p>One body-builder explained to a writer why he never switched to a high-carb 
diet back in the eighties as all of his weight-lifting friends did. For one 
thing, he knew that his grandparents ate all of the full-fat animal products on 
their farm and lived into their nineties. Also, their farmhand, one Indian Joe, 
ate only meat, intestines, and organs, was built like a body-builder, and only 
looked 40 when he was 70 years old.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m 70 yrs old, heavy the last 30yrs. &amp; decided it&rsquo;s time 
to scale down &amp; tone up because my weight was starting to bother me at 
275-lbs. Like Oprah Winfrey &amp; others have said , &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t eat 
after 7:00 pm. I started 01/16/2007 not eating anything after 6:00 pm but water 
&amp; Daily Pills. Approx.-into 20 days I lost 12-lbs &amp; the next 23 days 
3-lbs. I average 14 to 16 hours a night without eating &amp; drink very little 
water, maybe a glass a night sometimes.During the day I eat anything I want up 
to 6:00 pm. My daily appetite is getting less of an urge as in the previous 
readings in this article , I&rsquo;m not hungry in the morning so I have a 
slice of toast &amp; peanut butter with my coffee in the am . Later I have a 
banana for a snack ,sometimes a sandwitch &amp; coffee or milk at noon, little 
treats during the day &amp; a good dinner at 5:00 to 5:30 pm. Getting the 
feeling to skip breakfast or lunch lately . Before this nightly fasting I would 
Binge on treats all evening that got to where I was hooked. After these 43 days 
I feel comfortable &amp; satisfied with no urge to snack in the 
evening.Can&rsquo;t say I don&rsquo;t think about some Ice Cream now &amp; then 
.I&rsquo;m at 260 lbs &amp; holding until I see where this goes.</p>

<p>Have been using SLD/ Shangri-La Diet (not a diet, but a theoritic method 
for lowering the set point, which also suppresses appetite since December 2, 
2007, and on February 1, 2007, combined it with JUDDDD/ Johnson UpDayDownDay 
Diet (one of the researchers with Laub, I believe). I&rsquo;m doing very well 
on the combination. Have lost 30 lbs since October 9, 2007, when I began 
reducing/restricting my caloric intake. Since December, SLD has reduced 
appetite to a normal level (no great hunger, no cravings), and I can eat very 
little (about 450-500 calories) on my &ldquo;down&rdquo; or calorie restricted 
days without hunger, cravings, etc. I enjoy eating now, for the flavor and 
because I need food to live, and do not feel compulsions to eat, and my desires 
are geared toward healthy, fresh, nutritiously packed foods.</p> 
<p>I have had myocarditis (evidently viral) since at least 1998, resulting in 
heart failure/decreased ejection fraction, etc., but am doing excellently (I 
had ECP therapy from October &ndash; December 2006). With the CR IF (JUDDDD), 
SLD, continuous, gradual weight reduction, exercise, specific nutritional 
supplementation (Cellfood, StemEnhance, Oxegen BP, Idebenone, Fo-ti (like 
Resveratrol/Japanese Knotweed), Magnesium, Hawthorne Berry etc., etc., since 2 
weeks into ECP and ever since, I feel better than I have in 10 yrs&hellip;as 
energetic and healthy as if I didn&rsquo;t have CHF&hellip;full energy, full 
breath, etc. My bloodwork profile (done in the 3rd week of December 2006, 
before IF &ndash; JUDDDD, but after first 3 weeks of SLD) is excellent &mdash; 
all numbers in normal and excellent range. I expect with IF of JUDDDD, the next 
tests will be even better. I beleive that my heart will benefit, not only from 
the continuing, gradual weight loss and good nutrition, but from the other 
healthful effects of IF / CR, which may include increased elasticity of heart 
tissue and more&hellip;</p>

<p>Recently, I&#146;ve been trying the JUDDD diet (ADCR) by Dr. Johnson and he 
includes the following study (by Johnson, Laub, and others) on his JUDDDD 
website:</p> 
<p>
http://www.johnsonupdaydowndaydiet.samsbiz.com/content/00/01/53/97/83/userimages/ADCR%20article.pdf
</p> 
<p>One thing I noticed was that the study gives a different appraisal than do 
you regarding BDNF, which was lowered during the ADCR diet. The authors infer 
that this was a good thing, and refer to BDNF as a marker for inflammation, 
whereas you consider IF-diet heightened BDNF levels beneficial to the brain. 
Are both views correct?</p> 
<p>I&#146;ve tried a few IF diets, but the JUDDDD really works for me for 
weight-loss. That&#146;s with eating about 480 calories on the down days.</p> 
<p><em>Hi athelstan&ndash;</em></p>

<p>Hello Dr. Eades,</p> 
<p>I enjoy your informative blogs and have just begun reading them since the 
2006 winter holidays. Fasting, could that be why I have put on the 20 lbs that 
I lost? I began taking chromium 2 years ago.I did not change my low carb eating 
habits of 3 square meals a day. I took chromuim faithfully and began gaining 
weight.I have been able to maintain my weight but it is frustrating to not be 
able to lose it again. Should I have eaten less when I started using chromium? 
I will be fifty in a few days and I am tying peri-menopause and into the weight 
gain mix.</p> 
<p>I will let you know how it goes Dr. Mike,<br>
 Mary T</p> 
<p>I always considered fasting as being an unhealthy practice. Now I am 
beginning to see the reasonableness of it.In my college history class, I 
learned that the British considered the Natives as being lazy and unable of 
taking care of themselves. Why? They were thin &ldquo;poorly&rdquo; clothed and 
they were not big eaters. As a matter of fact they went many days without 
eating, especially, during the winter months.In retrospect, after reading 
increasingly more about the foods of these earlier cultures, I know this helped 
them to achieve outstanding health. Certainly the frequency of eating should 
also take credit. You do so much outstanding digging for facts.If you told me 
down was up, I would believe you! I am going to begin doing the fasting and let 
you know what happens to me. I must admit, I am afraid because I prefer eating 
over weightloss.I don&rsquo;t want to be miserable but this will answer some 
questions for me. I worry more with breakfast because I work early in the 
morning. My job is somewhat physically demanding and I want to have energy for 
this job. However, I have been known to start the day without my A.M. fuel up 
and I survived just fine. So, I am going to do this and let you know what I 
discovered. I wish that I had done this the same time that I started adding 
chromium.</p> 
<p><em>Hi Mary&ndash;</em></p>

<p>Hmm gorging yourself on a meal then sleeping or laying around until it was 
time for the next meal, sounds like a great lifestyle to me. I know that I am 
not doing this right but I have been eating 2 meals a day. I don&rsquo;t eat 
until lunch. I have had big low carb lunches. Yesterday, after a 14 hour fast, 
I had steak, salad and zucchini. Dinner was a beef patty, mustard greens and 
sliced avocados. I ate 14 hours later, perhaps not a long enough fast but it 
really kills me. I had a chicken, spinach, cheese omelet and a sliver of dark 
chocolate birthday cake with sliced strawberries. I made a huge omelet and 
filled up easily.I couldn&rsquo;t finish it but I plan to eat the remains 
throughout the day if I get any hunger pangs until dinner.</p> 
<p>I am thinking that it is probably not to even say breakfast lunch or 
dinner. Instead I should say my meal or my daily meal.I will let you know more 
about my experiment over the next few weeks.</p> 
<p>The biggest challenge will be figuring this out when I go back to a regular 
work schedule next week.</p>

<p>How does this eating method fit into an active lifestyle? I workout 6 days

20 minute 3 miles, have a 36&Prime; vertical leap and am training for my first 
marathon, I&rsquo;ve been able to achieve this eating 6 times a day. I notice 
significant drop offs in ability if I do not eat pre and post workouts&hellip;

<p>One thing that I am very observant of is menses. I think that I am noticing 
a bigger difference in this more than anything else. I am peri-menopausal and 
was experiencing longer than normal cycles. Now my last cycle was about a day 
shorter. Now my cycle was due about 3 days ago but has not yet started. I hope 
I&rsquo;m not pregnant . My weight always increases at this time, which it has 
done but nothing has started yet. I will post more as information comes in.</p>

<p>Hi<br>
 Have been following an IF regime for a few months which works very 
well.</p> 
<p>My rationale being that in paleo times there was variation in what was 
eaten and when eating occurred and it would tend to be a few hours after 
getting up each day.</p> 
<p>Basically, I dont eat till after 12pm (ie no breakfast). I eat basically 
paleo- whats in season and try and eat game (mainly kangaroo) or pasture fed 
meat.</p> 
<p>If i&rsquo;m busy during day (usually 1-3 D/wk) I miss lunch or just have 
100g tuna or similar. Dinner is my main meal and except for weekends I try to 
ensure I cease eating within a couple of hours after dark.</p> 
<p>At the weekends, no breakfast but have lunch and dinner as dictated by 
social requirements but I try and dodge dairy, grain and sugar.</p> 
<p>This works very well and I find easy to maintain. Im slowly losing weight 
(current BMI is 24- and will keep an eye on this side so I don&rsquo;t go below 
21)</p> 
<p>I think the timing and variation is a key area for diet exercise sleep etc 
when trying to mimic paleo &ldquo;life style&rdquo; to get the health benefits.
</p> 
<p>It would be of interest to hear your views on sleep (especially duration), 
climatic exposure (eg dowsing\cold showers etc) in the blog at some point.</p> 
<p>I use your basic antioxidant elements ala protein power lifeplan although a 
little lower in amounts if I can. Have looked for data comparing wild and 
feedlot style meat and composition of coq10, lipoic acid etc and have not found 
any. I wonder if you or a reader may have some knowledge of it.</p> 
<p>Thanks for writing your books and the blog.</p>

<p>Hello Mike I ran upon this site and read about all the health benefits you 
say come from an IF style diet.</p> 
<p>I for one have been running an IF diet for the last few weeks tailored 
around my workouts and body recomposition. I fast for 16 hours and re-feed for 
8 every day eg. on a workout day I will fast for 16 hours prior to my WO and 
upon finishing I will re-feed from 4PM till midnight with complex carbs and 
protein to help the starved muscle. Taking in appx BMR +25%. I will then go to 
sleep and fast the next day till 4PM which is a non WO day and I will simply 
keep calories restricted to appx. 50% BMR with low carb high protein moderate 
fat.And then repeat.. I have notices an increase in muscle fullness and fat 
free mass weight has stayed stable but with a loss in bf%. I must say that I 
will get a bit of stomach grumbling during the hours my body was used to 
getting food before the diet but it last maybe 5 minutes and dissipates. 
I&rsquo;m very happy with the results and think I will make this a long term 
way of eating.</p>

<p>In your 9/19/06 post- #89, you said &ldquo;cancer cells can&#146;t use 
ketones for energy and must turn to glucose to grow and reproduce. Which, in my 
opinion, makes it almost criminal to put patients with cancer on low-fat, 
high-carbohydrate diets&rdquo;.</p> 
<p>Do you rule out the Pritikin diet as a healthy choice for I.F. adherents 
with cancer? As you know, it IS low fat&hellip; but the carbohydrates are 
complex, not simple.</p> 
<p>By the way, I am very impressed by the attention you give to this site. 
Thank you.</p> 
<p><em>Hi Matt&ndash;</em></p> 
<p><em>No, I don&rsquo;t think Pritikin is a particularly healthy choice, 
although if used on an IF basis wouldn&rsquo;t be as bad.&nbsp; Still, 
it&rsquo;s pretty marginal in protein and totally deficient in good quality 
fat, both essential for optimal immune response.&nbsp; And it is the immune 
system that is the first line of defense against cancer.</em></p> 
<p><em>Studies have shown that a ketogenic diet helps in the treatment of 
malignant brain cancers, which makes sense in view of the fact that cancer 
cells, unlike normal cells which can use fat, glucose and ketones, can use only 
glucose.&nbsp; Keep the glucose low, starve the cancer.<br>
</em></p> 
<p><em>The fact that blood sugar is so essential for cancers to grow has led 
to a type of cancer treatment called Insulin Potentiation Therapy (IPT), a 
controversial treatment involving a combination of insulin and standard 
chemotherapeutic agents.&nbsp; The insulin is administered knocking the blood 
sugar down and basically starving the cancer, making it much more susceptible 
to the chemotherapy drugs.&nbsp; In fact, the doses of the chemotherapy drugs 
are about 10 to 15 percent of what they are in standard chemotherapy, which 
means that most of the horrible side effects &ndash; nausea, hair loss, 
tremendous fatigue, etc. &ndash; are eliminated with IPT.</em></p>

<p>I asked if you would consider the Pritikin diet acceptible for a cancer 
patient wanting to practice I.F. (i.e. eating Pritikin on the ON days), since 
it IS low in fat and high in (COMPLEX) carbohydrates. By cancer patient, I mean 
someone who has been treated for cancer and is now trying to eat well and

<p>A number of people on the Yahoo Intermittent Fasting group

the fact that they have very slightly elevated fasting glucose levels.

<p>I REALLY want to try I.F. But I am stopped dead in my tracks when I read

become aware of the fact that they have very slightly elevated fasting glucose 
levels. It&#146;s causing some to doubt the safety of long term I.F.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>I think this is a function of &ldquo;Dawn Phenomenon&rdquo; possibly an

night before my blood test then FBS is higher.</p>

<p>that 24 hour thing &hellip;.</p> 
<p>You write that most of the research starves the rats for 24 hours, then 
work and experiment diligently to design 24 hours for people.</p> 
<p>But surely 24 ratty[*] hours translates into much more than 24 for humans?
</p> 
<p>[*]yes, it&rsquo;s a Python reference</p> 
<p><em>24 ratty hours does indeed translate into more for humans &ndash; 
probably at least a couple of days.&nbsp; But it would be difficult to get 
humans to go that long without eating.</em></p>

<p>Dr. Eades: I am a 55 year old male, in good health, and reasonably active 
(I jog 4 miles 4 to 5 days per week). I have currently been fasting on 
Saturdays (36 hours, Fri.pm till Sun.am). I am a semi-vegetarian. (I 
occasionally eat meat, but prefer veggies and particularly fruit. I would like 
to start the IF lifestyle, to lose a few pounds (3 to 5), but mostly to 
increase health and quality of life. My question is, since you primarily 
recommend LC eating, what do you think about my eating style and should I 
change it when starting the IF? If I need extra protein, as you have 
recommended so often, is there a way to do it without eating so much meat? 
Thank you for your time and expertise. Randy M.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been alternate day fasting now since May 13/07, and have found 
it pretty easy. Not a single slip-up. I find it gets easier as I go along too, 
to the point where I&rsquo;m kind of indifferent to whether it&rsquo;s an 
eating day or a fasting day.</p> 
<p>I go a full day without eating (so I&rsquo;m fasting 36 hours, and eating 
no more than 12).</p> 
<p>To better imitate the ratty day in the experiments I could fast two days, 
and eat for two. I&rsquo;d fast for exactly the same amount of days per year so 
calorically it would be the same as I&rsquo;m doing now.</p> 
<p>Subject to my being able to do it are there any downsides that occur to 
you? Do you think that this would be a better approximation of the rats&rsquo; 
experimental conditions (with perhaps more likelihood of receiving similar 
benefits)?</p> 
<p><em>Hi Ross&ndash;</em></p> 
<p><em>I don&rsquo;t see any problems with your regimen as long as you get

<p>On second thought&hellip; I think that 20 human days would be closer to the 
rat&rsquo;s day as a percentage of their lifespan.</p> 
<p>I&rsquo;m doubtful that 20 human days alternating would be equivalent 
&mdash; the rats wouldn&rsquo;t be starving in their 24 hour fasting period, 
just hungry.</p> 
<p>So perhaps trying to match the rat&rsquo;s day as a percentage of lifespan 
isn&rsquo;t critical, although it seems likely that there is some optimal 
period between 24 hours and 20 days.<br>
 Would two, or even three days fasting 
be better than one I wonder?</p> 
<p>I don&rsquo;t know the answer to that question.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s probably 
difficult enough for most people to fast just one day, let alone two or three.

<p>During my fasting hours I am going to try and avoid preparing food, cooking 
or messing about the kitchen<br>
 I hope having hot coffee or tea doesn&rsquo;t 
affect it.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;The autonomic innervation of islets plays an important role in the 
modulation of insulin release from the islet cells of Langherhans. Insulin is 
secreted at the smell, sight and expectation of food. This is known as the 
cephalic phase of insulin secretion and is due to the 
hypothalamo-entero-insular axis which is mediated by vagal nerve[1]</p>

<p>Yes, just working on fractional time equivalents is not great, but 
it&rsquo;s far easier than the ideal, which would be to find which genes and 
gene groups are involved, and how long of a fast it would take to appropriately 
affect expression or suppression .</p> 
<p>Almost certainly there would also be &ldquo;diminishing returns&rdquo;, (I 
would expect exponentially diminishing, if pure chemistry is involved without 
genetic &ldquo;threshold&rdquo; effects), whereby a 1 day fast might provide 
40% of the benefit (number pulled out of thin air), 2 days 65%, 3 days 75% and 
so forth</p> 
<p>&gt;&gt; So perhaps trying to match the rat&#146;s day as a percentage of 
lifespan isn&#146;t critical,</p> 
<p><em>Hi Sam&ndash;</em></p>

<p>Hi Doctor,</p> 
<p>A question about eating QOD.</p> 
<p>I have been a vegetarian since 16 (no fish no meat) currently I am 29. Up 
to a few years ago I had the good habit of fasting on Fridays.<br>
 I starting 
eating QOD 3 weeks ago to get rid of ~8kg (I have no P.M.History whatsoever) 
and it works great so far. I feel great on the fasting days, and I can feel a 
nice spiritual effect too.<br>
 However, as I am a nurse my mind keeps 
questioning, as I am not eating for ~ 34 h every other day (which, again, I 
have no problem with). &ndash;</p> 
<p>Am I not putting too much stress on the pancreas on the off days to produce 
an increased amt of glucagon every second day?</p> 
<p>I would give this diet full credit as a wt loss solution for a short time, 
as long as I can go the fasting day with no surrogates. I do not want to eat 
dinner on fast days, I do not like the idea of &lsquo;diet wafers&rsquo; for 
the blood glucose either. In Christianity and other religions there have been 
numerous hermits who exalt the virtues of even longer fasting periods and 
allegedly results are amazing.</p> 
<p>For example, I know of a Christian priest who was seriously ill in his 
early 60s, DVT and pain in legs due to long distances on foot, got cured 
through long fasts and addopted regular longer fasting periods afterwards. Some 
of the spectacular results he achieved were previously brittle nails became 
strong, having a head full of hair back again (which turned from white to grey) 
up until the end of his life in his 90s, and being in full strength &mdash; in 
his mid-90s he was still crossing part of the Danube river swimming&hellip; a 
river which is pretty large&hellip; He attributed the radical changes on his 
body to fasting.</p> 
<p>Many mystics were enjoying long fasts seemingly not concerned about medical 
details, and they regarded it as an effective panacea, which they put into 
practice, allegedly with great effects.</p> 
<p>However, the nagging question for me still remains &mdash; any possible 
stress on the pancreas re: increased glucagon, can that be a pre-ambule for any 
later pancreas condition etc.</p> 
<p>Thanks&hellip;</p> 
<p><em>Hi Rudra&ndash;</em></p> 
<p><em>I don&rsquo;t think you have anything to worry about.&nbsp; Fasting 
doesn&rsquo;t put nearly the stress on the alpha cells &ndash; those pancreatic 
cells that produce glucagon &ndash; as eating large amounts of carb puts on the 
beta cells &ndash; the pancreatic cells producing insulin.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve 
never heard of alpha cells failing as do beta cells from over 
stimulation.&nbsp; Since periodic fasting &ndash; not by choice, but by 
necessity &ndash; was a common occurrence during our development as a species, 
I&rsquo;m pretty sure the alpha cells have evolved to handle making the amounts 
of glucagon required without a problem.</em></p>

<p>Hi Michael,</p> 
<p>This blog is so active I couldn&rsquo;t find a clear answer to my question, 
so sorry if you&rsquo;ve already addressed it. If I eat once/day and eat all of 
my protein in one big lump is it all utilized as protein or will some be 
converted via gluconeogenesis? Would eating a moderate amount in the 
&ldquo;main&rdquo; meal and then having a small protein meal a few hours later 
within the IF window work better as far as using that protein goes?</p> 
<p>Thanks!</p> 
<p><em>Hi Iris&ndash;</em></p> 
<p><em>You don&rsquo;t force gluconeogenesis by eating protein.&nbsp; You only 
undergo gluconeogenesis if your blood sugar levels start to drop too low.&nbsp; 
Protein is broken down into its constituent amino acids, which are then used or 
stored.</em></p>

<p>I do the warrior diet every day which is intermittent fasting with one meal 
a day at dinner. Ori Hofmekler, the author of the diet, says that during the 
fast you are allowed to have a couple pieces of whole fruit like an apple, 
since fruit goes straight through the stomach and doesn&rsquo;t put any strain 
on the digestive system and increases the effect of the detoxification process 
during the fast. Do you think though that eating fruit would make the fast less 
effective?</p> 
<p>Probably not.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t buy the idea that fruit goes straight 
through the stomach and doesn&rsquo;t put a strain on the digestive system 
&ndash; fruit is digested just like everything else.&nbsp; And I don&rsquo;t 
believe that there is any special detoxifying properties of fruit.&nbsp; But, 
having said all that, I doubt that it will make the fast less effective.&nbsp; 
What will make the fast less effective is snacking during fasting times, but 
then it wouldn&rsquo;t be a fast.</p> Reply <br>

<p>Dr. Eades,<br>
 Can you tell me how IF will affect your gallbladder? I know 
that if you don&rsquo;t eat enough fat, your gallbladder is not doing 
it&rsquo;s job. I&rsquo;ve heard that&rsquo;s why many anorexics, low fatters 
have their gallbladders fail. Will fasting for 24 hours mess up your 
gallbladder?</p> 
<p>Kim</p> 
<p><em>Hi Kim&ndash;</em></p> <em> 
<p>IF shouldn&rsquo;t affect your gall bladder at all as long as you eat some 
fat on your eat days. The gall bladder concentrates cholesterol as part of the 
bile salts that are squirted out of the gall bladder and mixed in with the fat 
going down the digestive tract. The cholesterol helps to make the fat better 
able to be absorbed. With very-low-fat diets, the gall bladder doesn&rsquo;t 
squirt its contents out because there is no fat going down the digestive tract. 
If the very-low-fat diet goes on for a while the cholesterol that is sitting in 
the stagnant fluid in the gall bladder can begin to form into stones. These 
stones usually stay in the gall bladder, but sometimes when someone who has 
been on a low-fat diet for a long time decides to go out and blow it out on 
pizza or burgers or some other high fat food the trouble can start. What 
happens is that when this fat comes down the digestive tract the gall bladder 
squirts out its bile salts to help absorb the fat. But if there are small 
stones in the gall bladder, these stones can be forced down into the gall 
bladder ducts, precipitating the agonizing pain of a gall bladder attack, a 
situation that typically requires surgical intervention. It can all be avoided 
by eating fat and keeping the gall bladder from letting it&rsquo;s contents 
become stagnant.</p> 
<p>Hope this answers your question.</p> </em>

 Somewhere in your book &ldquo;Protein Power Lifeplan&rdquo; you

<p>It is true though, is it not?<br>
 The digestive system jumps into action 
the minute we swallow anything?<br>
 And once started, it anticipates more to 
come. Making us feel more hungry than we would otherwise feel while fasting.<br>
 So a good case for IF is that we give the body a vacation from the work of 
digesting.</p> Reply <br>

to eat? I&rsquo;m sure you know that when in college you don&rsquo;t know what 
your doing at the same time every day. If I happen to be away from my apartment 
and miss that time period, would it do any damage to continue fasting all the 
way to the next eating period? Or would it be more beneficial to just eat when 
I had the chance and go back to my original time period?</p>

<p>Hi&hellip;</p> 
<p>I started the warrior diet(20/4) about 4 months ago. I have gone from 206 
pounds to 167 pounds. At first it was hard&hellip;. I tryed the 24 hours 
on&hellip;. 24 hours off and didn&rsquo;t seem to be able to do that, but the 
20/4 got easier as I did it. I now can even go out for an hour walk everyday 
before dinner.</p> 
<p>Now my 2 hour glucose test wasn&rsquo;t all that good. It was 145&hellip;. 
where last year it was 74. I&rsquo;m not happy about that, but I am hoping the 
results are because I am losing so much weight.</p> 
<p>I am a participant in the Diabetic Prevention Program Outcome Study and 
will go back for bloodwork in February and hoping for better numbers.</p>

<p>In both this forum and in the Yahoo intermittent fasting group, I see 
numerous instances of people reporting that their fasting glucose levels have 
increased while practicing E.O.D. fasting. And time and again, these reports 
seem to be doubted, dismissed out of hand or minimized as a legitimate cause 
for concern. To me, elevated glucose levels seem a MAJOR cause for concern. And 
they DO seem to be a not uncommon side effect of intermittent fasting. Am I 
missing something?</p>

Anyone who gets blood drawn to check fasting blood sugar ought to have a HgbA1c 
measure included to see if the increase in fasting blood sugar is just a 
strange blip or is a measure of an overall rise in blood sugar over time.</p>

<p>Hi&hellip; I&rsquo;m vegetarian and the only fat I eat is my 6 grams of 
fish oil(which technically makes me not very vegetarian, but I read somewhere 
that this help to burn fat with exercise) and maybe a table spoon of grape seed 
oil or olive olive when I cook onions and peppers. I think it was Dr. Fuhrman 
that said in his book &ldquo;Eat2Live&rdquo; that when you lost weight it was 
like you were on a high fat diet or something like that&hellip; LOL Oh and I do 
eat an occasional avocado on my salad.</p> 
<p>I was thinking the fish oil and walking an hour a day would raise my HDL, 
but it didn&rsquo;t. Now I only went from 54 to 47.</p> 
<p>Oh by the way I just got your book &ldquo;The Protein Power Lifeplan&rdquo; 
from the library. I&rsquo;m hoping I will have non meat options. LOL I actually 
wandered onto this website because I google Dr. Mattson&rsquo;s Study on

<p>Hello MR and MD<br>
 I wonder why dietary and nutrition websites dance 
around the subject of &#147;food addiction&#148;.<br>
 When it comes right down 
to it, those of us who love food, love to eat, and sometimes eat to excess, 
have an addiction to food.<br>
 I am thin and healthy, but I have found that IF 
gives me great relief from this &#147;addiction&#148;.<br>
 Rather than torture 
myself with three small restricted meals per day, I can eat whatever I want 
(Protein Power + the occasional bread and dessert when dining out), and leave 
the table truly satisfied. The only caveat is that it is only once a day. But, 
that one meal is well worth waiting for.<br>
 Support or suggestions on-line, 
seem to be only offered by wackos selling snake oil or scary religious based 
sites (also selling snake oil).<br>
 Why can it not simply be treated as a fact 
of life. Many (many many) people simply love to eat&hellip;to excess.</p> 
<p><em>I don&rsquo;t have any doubt that some people are food addicted. For 
them, I think the intermittent fast is probably the best thing going for all 
the reasons you mention.</em></p> <em>

<p>Is there a book to read that would explain all this? I waited until 5:00pm 
to eat today and it was easy. I eat a high-fat, low carb diet. I ate twice. 
Once at 5:00 and again at 7:00. I think I ate about 1400 calories&hellip; maybe 
1500. Does that seem reasonable? And then I am supposed to eat again in the 
morning and at lunch&ndash;stopping at 5:00? I think I could easily do this, 
but is it certain that I won&rsquo;t further damage my metabolism or insulin 
mechanism? I am so sick of making big mistakes with my health and ending up 
fatter! Where can I learn more?</p>

<p>Hi Mike,</p> 
<p>I thought I&rsquo;d give you a quick update. I&rsquo;ve fasted since last 
November, so 11.5 months in all. Unfortunately though, I&rsquo;ve just decided 
to stop. Most of my experience has been positive, but the one negative seems to 
coincide with what I&rsquo;ve seen in a study as the main/only downside to IF 
&ndash; increased BP. I&rsquo;ve had slightly elevated BP before IF&rsquo;ing, 
but since IF&rsquo;ing, it&rsquo;s been much higher. I&rsquo;ve tried keeping 
it under control by eliminating sodium (replacing it with potassium), trying to 
stay hydrated, consuming cinnamon, doing isometric hand-grip exercises and 
doing biofeedback breathing exercises. In other words, everything short of 
drugs. Oh, and I guess short of exercise too, since my schedule has made all 
but a lunch-time walk a few times a week difficult. I may yet come back to IF, 
but I think for now it&rsquo;s more important to get BP under control, and my 
fitness level up. I&rsquo;m eating reasonable quantities now and this is easy 
because I now get to eat throughout the day! I figure I may try my hand at CR 
at some point, but for now just trying to eat reasonable amounts of food and of 
course get adequate amounts of protein and keep my carb intake to PP levels. 
It&rsquo;s been an interesting year to say the least!</p> 
<p><em>Hi Levi&ndash;</em></p> <em> 
<p>It bumfuzzles me why your blood pressure has gone up. (Or why 
anyone&rsquo;s would go up.) Are you following a low-carb diet during your 
eating days or are you eating a lot of carbs? I&rsquo;m curious because one of 
the virtues of the IF is that it gives people a little more leeway carbwise in 
their diet. Have you lost weight since starting the IF?</p>

<p>hello Dr Eades. i have asked for comments on this subject from my 
lowcarbfriends but i need more information. you state that no calorie beverages 
are okay, my question: since coffee, for example, has an effect on pretty much 
every organ in the body, is the benefit of the fast lost or lessened by 
drinking it? benefits like GH secretion just for one. this would also include 
diet sodas and other concoctions. i developed digestive disorders when i was 
vegetarian and after years of lc, i conquered IBS but heart burn has not 
improved at all. IF sounds like the way to go but i may have to do just water 
throughout the day which, as you know, makes it more difficult. the other 
problem i see is (believe it or not) weight loss!! i cannot possibly consume my 
day&rsquo;s calories in a short time. my tummy would never allow it. i truly 
need to get a handle on this digestive stuff, though. it truly makes me 
miserable. IF sounds like it could heal my problem. thanks for the blog!

<p><em>Hi Judith&ndash;</em></p> <em> 
<p>I think the coffee is fine as long as you don&rsquo;t sweeten it with sugar 
or put loads of cream in it. When I IF I drink coffee all the time. I 
don&rsquo;t drink diet sodas because I don&rsquo;t particularly like them, but 
they should be fine also. Except sometimes the sweetness of the artificial 
sweetener can stimulate a little insulin squirt that runs your blood sugar down 
and makes you hungry. If you don&rsquo;t have a problem with that, the diet 
sodas should be okay.</p> 
<p>Keep me posted as to how your heartburn does on the IF. I&rsquo;m curious.

<p>Whew, so much has been observed and experimented on this subject. I think 
that IF has become the most significant piece of dietary information since I 
began the low carb trek. I know that I did make comments on this and I hope 
that I am not repeating myself. I know that I had posted that I was able to go 
14 hours without eating. I have since expanded that to my goal of fasting for 
20 hours and eating within a 4 hour window. On Thanksgiving, I plan on forgoing 
food until dinner time. I may have some mashed potatoes but, for the most part, 
the day will be low carb including desserts.</p> 
<p>I have not lost hoards of weight but one thing I have noticed is that my 
weight is more responsive to exercise. Before, even though I was low carbing, I 
was gaining weight. I was eating 3-4 meals a day. These meals were spaced well, 
they were just too often. It was evident that my insulin wasn&rsquo;t well 
controlled because I was hungry all the time. Mind you, I was not nearly as 
ravenous as I was in my pre-low carb days. Now that I have included IF in my 
daily regimen, I am seeing some positive changes namely appetite control. I go 
to work without eating.To comment on some other concerns stated throughout this 
blog, I exercise towards the end of my fasting period and I put off eating for 
an hour following exercise. Or, I will postpone my workout for 3 hours after 
eating and eat an hour following the workout. In retrospect, I do everything on 
an empty stomach now. I do not know what my glucose is but I am not having any 
detectable insulin spikes. I began doing this after reading about regulating 
the human growth hormone in Wikipedia and other studies ( including the one in 
PP ). I am nowhere near being athletic but exercise in some form has always 
been important to me. I notice that I am developing muscles in my arms. My 
waist is losing its girth. My body&rsquo;s mass is decreasing regardless of 
what the scale says. I really want to stick with this religiously for a year 
just to see how far I can go. I want to share this information with my family 
and friends but i don&rsquo;t let them know what i am doing yet. They will say 
I am becoming anorexic, which is miles from the truth. I love food, that is not 
the problem. Food hurts me when I do it too often.</p> 
<p>Dr. Mike, I also read your blog in the anti-inflammatory properties of IF. 
Low carb has helped greatly with joint pain, but it improved even more after 
beginning IF.My son is having problems with his sciatic nerve. Not the nerve 
actually, but the muscle around it. If I understand correctly, the muscle is 
rubbing against the nerve. He will need to go PT again soon but I am trying to 
encourage him to do IF and to add coconut oil to his diet. His diet is very low 
in carbs, naturally. He is not a big carb eater but he could stand to lower 
them a little more. So as you can see my low carb/IF saga has a long way to go.

<p>Hey Mike,</p> 
<p>Just to answer your questions, yes, I&rsquo;ve generally kept to lc diet as 
described in Protein Power. I&rsquo;ve not been perfect, of course, but I think 
I&rsquo;ve probably kept consistant 80-90% of the time. My family has a history 
of heart disease, although I&rsquo;m not sure about BP except I know that my 
half-brother, who is not significantly overweight, has been put on medication 
for it. The relatively new study I saw by Mattson which mentions BP increase is 
in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition. For your readers here&rsquo;s a 
link to the abstract:</p> 
<p>
http://www.ars.usda.gov/research/publications/Publications.htm?seq_no_115=200159
</p> 
<p>I could not get access to the full study, but I&rsquo;m not sure that would 
help much given the fact that I&rsquo;m a layman without much technical 
background in nutrition, medicine, etc.</p> 
<p>Since I started eating 3 meals per day again, I do feel better, but I 
haven&rsquo;t checked BP yet since I figured a few days could not really change 
much&hellip;</p>

<p>Wondering if anyone has any updates on IF and weightloss. I have been 
looking into fasting and came across IF. Its definitely something that has been 
of interest to me in trying to live a healthier lifestyle, but I wont say that 
I also need to lose 15-20 lbs. from having two children in the past two years. 
I&rsquo;m hoping that IF gives me both the lifestyle I&rsquo;m looking for but 
aides me in losing this weight.</p> 
<p>Can anyone provide some weight loss stories and IF</p>

<p><em>Hi Jaime&ndash;</em></p> <em> 
<p>I&rsquo;ll throw it out for the group to comment on. It&rsquo;s been my 
experience that IF works okay for weight loss, but probably not as well as a 
good low-carb diet. The advantage of IF is that on eating days one can eat 
foods that one can&rsquo;t eat on a good low-carb diet and still lose some 
weight.</p>

<p>Hello Jaime,</p> 
<p>i am on IF since Mid-March this year and lost about 10kg (BTW, i am 48 
years old). I suspect that i could have lost more if i exercised more and 
continuously. But given the fact that i have a quite sedentary job and 
lifestyle altogether, i guess it&rsquo;s not too bad a result.<br>
 I started 
with a eat-everything-you-want approach but noticed that within my 3-4 h eating 
window i tended to eat too much junk carbs (chocolate, potatoe chips etc.) 
which, as i felt it, slowed down the weigh loss considerably. As i became more 
and more convinced that low-carb is a healthier dietary lifestyle i switched 
over and now have the impression that weight loss accelerates again.<br>
 When 
my wife (not too sportive either) was sure that this is not just one of my 
temporary spleens she joined me IFing and is quite satisfied wit the results 
(even though she loses weight slower than me, which is, AFAIK, overall, typical 
for females.)<br>
 One nice side effect of this way of eating is that i have 
now a tremendously more precise feeling how much food i *really* need to eat. 
Which is, btw, considerably less than one would expect. To use an image that 
Gary Taubes deploys somewhere: As i &ldquo;live as a tailor&rdquo; i finally 
&ldquo;eat as a tailor&rdquo;. If i switch to &ldquo;living as a 
lumberjack&rdquo; (= exercise intensely) i am now quite sure that i will eat 
appropriately (but not more). Hope this helps.</p> Reply <br>

<p>Hello Dr MRE,<br>
 Thanks for keeping up with this post, it continues to 
provide useful information. I&rsquo;d like to share something brief about my 
experience with IF, and ask for your insight: I do not eat bread, pasta, 
potatoes, etc. Occasionally do eat dessert. I&rsquo;m very active, and 
train/exercise 4-5 times a week. My bodyweight is 228 lbs, and I do not know my 
bf%.<br>
 Using a 20 hour fast/4 hour feeding window (in 8 weeks), I have lost 
a few lbs. However, the weight loss stalled there. I have not yet had any 
bloodwork done to compare my lipid values with pre-IF, but have been feeling 
good. The clarity and self-control have been great bonuses to IF.<br>
 Why has 
my weight loss stopped, do you think? This week switched to a 24 on/24 off 
program a la your experience above, and am hoping to see an increase in fat 
loss due to the extra 4 hours of fasting.<br>
 Does your experience offer any 
insight?<br>
 Thanks! </p>

<p>It&rsquo;s hard to say what the problem is. You could be re-composing in

<p>it seems exercise in the morning during IF might augment Growth Hormone

<p>My partner Cherie and I have been doing intermittent fasting since Janury 
1st, and so far I am down 12lbs. I feel great, and this is the easiest diet I 
have ever tried.</p> 
<p>I blogged about my experiences here: 
http://radven.livejournal.com/116689.html</p> 
<p>We haven&rsquo;t been doing a true fast, and I think that helps. We eat 
whatever we want from 6:30pm one day to 6:30pm the next. Then for our 24 hours 
of fasting, we limit ourselves to 400 calories spread out over the day &ndash; 
usually a small yogurt and some veggies.</p>

<p>When I first read this I was worried about the whole yo-yo low-calorie diet 
thing which most people face when they try to reduce the calorie intake.<br>
 
For some reason, we have all been told that we MUST MUST MUST eat breakfast. 
And I&rsquo;ve never been able to work out why beyond the fact that it starts 
your body burning food.</p> 
<p>However, the more I thought about it, the more it made sense to skip 
meals&hellip; After all, one of the biggest energy consumptions of our body 
comes from digesting food. So when we have those big breakfasts we are actually 
stealing all this energy that our brain could be using.</p> 
<p>I think this may be why the IF approach increases BDNF in the brain &ndash; 
because during fasting it is getting a stable input of energy from the body, 
rather the continuously fluxing which comes from digesting food.</p> 
<p>Fasting towards the end of the day might even help because you are more 
tired by the time you sleep, which allows more prolonged bouts of REM.</p> 
<p>Who knows? The point is that the advice that has been shoved down our 
throats for so long may not really be so great after all. Even if it was 
&lsquo;scientifically deduced&rsquo;.</p>

<p>I agree with Chris above &ndash; I have never been able to wake up at 6 and 
eat a bite before 9am&hellip; It has been like this for me since my childhood 
days and I stopped eating breakfast at age 12. I get so nauseus if I eat before 
8am but when I eat after 9am I am fine. If I haven&rsquo;t eaten by ten I get a 
so-called hollow feeling on my stomach and then I have to eat.</p> 
<p>Digestion takes up a lot of energy and I am definately not a morning 
person&hellip; I only wake up (mentally) after 9am. I am a little overweight by 
about 10kg (don&rsquo;t know how many lbs) and have an underactive thyriod 
gland (but taking thyroxine pill 0,1mg every day) which results in me having a 
slower metabolism (according to gp) although I can feel that I can&rsquo;t have 
such a slow metabolism as I tend to eat at least 4/5 times a day because I eat 
when I feel hungry (the hollow feeling on my stomach)</p> 
<p>My question is that if I go on a low carb eating plan combined with the IF 
&ndash; will I still slow my metabolism and gain even more weight?</p> 
<p>Thanks for the post &ndash; It is great and please keep up the good work!

protein and drink too little water because of the kidneys failing.<br>
 Is this 
true?</p> 
<p>Please advise?</p>

<p>This is my first time visiting this site. I have read the book Protein 
Power twice and constantly refer back to it with questions. My husband and I 
started the diet sometime in January. I have lost 10lbs and my husband has lost 
15lbs. Our main goal of this diet was for me to lose weight and to bring down 
my husbands cholesterol. His cholesterol has been bad since he first had it 
checked at age 25. We were thrilled when my very slightly elevated cholesterol 
and triglycerides returned to normal range after being on the diet for only 5 
weeks. We anxiously awaited his test results only to find they are worse.<br>
 
total- 227<br>
 HDL- 35<br>
 LDL- 175<br>
 The one area where we saw huge 
improvement was with his triglycerides. They fell from 207 to 87.<br>
 The Dr 
has recommended medication. We are staying on the diet and trying to add some 
exercise. If you have any thoughts or recommendations we would be very 
appreciative.</p> 
<p><em>I can&rsquo;t really make medical recommendations over the internet. I 
don&rsquo;t know what your husband&rsquo;s earlier labs were, but I do know 
that a drop in triglycerides from 207 to 87 is a good thing and indicates that 
the LDL particle size has probably shifted to the larger, better kind. You need 
to work through these issues with your physician. If you don&rsquo;t trust 
his/her advice, find a physician in whom you have more confidence.</em></p> <em>

<p>Dr. Eades,<br>
 I&rsquo;ve been doing IF since I first read this blog three 
weeks ago. It hasn&rsquo;t been a problem to not eat for 24 hours, so I&rsquo;m 
sure I can stick with it forever. But to see how much good the regime is doing, 
and also to make sure it is doing no harm, I would very much appreciate it if 
you could list the tests you recommend getting, how often, and what to look for 
in those tests.<br>
 Here in Mexico it&rsquo;s possible to order tests directly 
at the lab, and I would prefer to keep an eye on the imporant parameters 
myself, rather than rely on a doctor.<br>
 Thanks!<br>

<p>Are there any new stories on weight loss from intermittent fasting? Has 
anyone tried IF and not lose weight?</p> 
<p>Doctor, has there been any new research on IF? Has it been definitely 
linked to increased blood pressure?</p>

<p>Hi Mike,</p> 
<p>Fascinating stuff. I&rsquo;ve done the Warrior Diet in the past, so I 
understand the basic concept (and I do kinda miss the old WD days). I may have 
to give this a try, especially for the anti-depression benefit (I&rsquo;ve been 
on anti-depressants twice in the past and I want it to go away for good).</p> 
<p>I&rsquo;ve been reading through the posts and wanted to ask if anyone who 
is highly active has done IF and reported their results? I do martial arts and 
heavy weight-training and would not want to compromise performance or gains in 
either case.</p> 
<p>I&rsquo;ve read that supplementing with l-glutamine can help stave off some 
muscle loss in the case of CR or very low-carb diets; would it be beneficial 
during IF? What about branched chain amino acid supplementation?</p> 
<p><em>I think that both l-glutamine and BCAA supplementation would be helpful.

<p>hi dr. eades,</p> 
<p>i am begining my 2nd week of intermittent fasting and i&rsquo;m amazed at 
how easy and great it feels! i eat between 5pm-9pm but consume unlimited water 
and decaf black coffee and tea during the day, so i&rsquo;m getting a 20 hour 
fast in every day. i keep my meals to naturally low carb whole foods (grass-fed 
pasture finished meats, ocean fish, non starchy vegetables, eggs, butter and 
olive oil and very small amounts of berries/melon) but plan on trying some 
portion controlled higher carb whole foods soon. so far, i&rsquo;ve experienced 
deeper more restful sleep, more energy for exercise and have much greater 
clarity of thought. but the biggest plus is simply being really hungry by the 
time my eating window rolls around..i find that i actually eat much less than 
before! i think it&rsquo;s because since i&rsquo;m eating when i&rsquo;m really 
hungry, it&rsquo;s very easy to recognize when my hunger is satisfied and i 
stop eating when i&rsquo;ve really had enough. i&rsquo;ve experiemented with 
lots of different eating styles in my day (vegan, low fat, low calorie, 
traditional low carb, only produce a la joel fuhrman etc) and NONE have felt 
more natural than IF coupled with low carb. thanks for posting&hellip;i never 
would have heard about this without your delightful blog!</p> 
<p><em>High Ida&ndash;</em></p> <em> 
<p>Glad to hear you&rsquo;re doing so well. I, too, found the same phenomenon 
when I was IFing. I expected that when eat time rolled around I would consume 
everything in sight, but I ended up not eating all that much more than if I 
hadn&rsquo;t fasted for the previous 24 hours.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been intermittent fasting for about 1.6 years now. I also do at 
least a couple longer fast (15 days) yearly. I eat every 36 hours, mostly 
carrot / apple juice, oranges and sometimes toast. I have just recently changed 
to eating on every 3rd Day now. So I eat about every 80 hours now. I exercise 
daily and have a busy day job protecting assets of a large Oil &amp; Gas 
company. I maintain a good weight and well toned muscle mass. Intermittent 
fasting has allowed my body to completely overhaul itself. I love life and 
enjoy food, however I have food and my body under my control, this is a 
wonderful feeling.<br>

<p>Hello,</p> 
<p>Do you see any problem with a younger person trying this? I&rsquo;m 15 and 
overweight, and figure it&rsquo;s about time I do something about it. I also 
plan on doing some exercise, so I was thinking that on the days I&rsquo;m 
eating, I will lift weights and do some sit-ups (or if you have any other 
exercises that might help me lose weight and build muscle mass). Does that 
sound okay? Great post, by the way.</p> 
<p><em>Hi Will&ndash;</em></p> <em> 
<p>I don&rsquo;t see any reason an overweight young person shouldn&rsquo;t 
give this a whirl. But I don&rsquo;t know you and your specific medical

<p>I tried IF this fall and I found on my fasting days, by early afternoon, I 
could not concentrate, I was pretty spacey, zoned out and clumsy. For years I 
used to have a binge day and then for the next couple of days I&rsquo;d limit 
myself to about 900 kcal. Since I was eating small amounts frequently I did not 
experience the effects of low blood sugar very often. Although this was 
observed to be poor eating behaviour I suppose it wasn&rsquo;t as bad as it was 
made out to be.</p> 
<p><em>I&rsquo;ve encountered a number of people with this response. Some of 
the practitioners who use IF actually encourage the intake of a smaller number 
of calories on the &lsquo;fasting&rsquo; days for this very reason.</em></p>

<p>I just want to post an update on my experience. I continue to IF ( I have 
been doing it for over a year now ), combined with healthy low carb eating. I 
exercise, although I have never been athletic, I have also managed to build a 
liittle muscle. . I exercise while I am in my fasting mode and I do not eat for 
atleast an hour following exercise. My body is responding better to exercise 
than in the past. Generally I fast for 20 hours and then consume my meals I eat 
within a 4 hour window. This usually consists of my fast breaking meal and 
supper. However, with Spring concerts, my schedule has been a little whacko so 
I have been eating mostly once a day. I am just fine.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve just started 24-36 hour fasting, thanks to a new article I found 
tucked away in the latest issue of Men&rsquo;s Health Magazine. Then I came 
across your blog here while looking for more info.</p> 
<p>I&rsquo;ve done 3 fasts, and can honestly say it has been easier than 
expected, and I do feel great during, and especially right after a fast. I am 
totally sold.</p> 
<p>Questions though&hellip;<br>
 1. You mention coffee as being OK on the 
fast, which I have been drinking. But I use splenda and a little 2% 
milk&hellip; is that killing my results?<br>
 2. I have religiously taken a 
multivitamin every morning for 6 years, and don&rsquo;t feel right about 
skipping this regimen. Is that ok (or very recommended) while mid-fast, or am I 
sabotaging my fasting process?</p> 
<p>Thanks for all the research and reporting!!</p> 
<p><em>I don&rsquo;t think coffee is a problem, even with a touch of 2% milk.

<p>I am thoroughly convinced that intermittant fasting is a better way health 
maintainence. I have been doing it for almost 2 decades. I became pregnant for 
the first time in 1998 when i told the doctor my eating schedule he insisted i 
eat according to us guidelines for my babys health and i gained almost 80 lbs 
in 9 months and had pregnancy complications. I lost the weight quickly by 
resuming my one meal a day and i fasted on mondays. I became pregnant again in 
2002 and this time i stayed on my one meal a day (no fasting) and i gained 20 
pounds and had a perfectly healthy pregnancy. When i explained to my doctor my 
eating routine he told me it was not normal and suggested the same 3-5 meals a 
day and NO fasting. all i know is that when i eat 3 to 5 meals a day with 6-11 
carb servings i became a house and i know that i have been healthy and 
energetic and i am more active than a lot of my 20 year old neighbors because i 
do what feels right for my body. My fast begins after Sundays meal and that is 
usually around 4 pm. I then eat nothing all day Monday and I usually have my 
first meal on Tuesday morning earlier to break the fast. My eating schedule is 
a result of my past work schedule. 20 years ago i was deliviering papers at 3 
in the morning and then i went straight to college where I stayed all day and 
then drove to my evening job. I was so poor i did not have money for fast food 
or to eat out and i found that the only time i had to eat was when i can home 
at night. After 4 years of this i found that going back to three meals a day 
just didnt work for me. Especially having quit my morning paper delivery which 
had me running over 100 flights of stairs wieghted down with papers, it was 
hard for me to feel like i should be eating 3 carb meals a day.<br>
 I have 
read you book and readily tell people about it. I appreciate your extensive 
research and willingness to examine all sides of subject before drawing the 
conclusion.<br>

<p>I have been IFing for a week now and I am delighted with living this 
way&hellip; I have gained 60 lbs over the last five years; never had a weight 
issue until this time. I have tried all kinds of diets but I always found that 
once I start eating, it becomes difficult to stop. I find it much easier to not 
eat as in the IF program and then to eat what I want. My experience so far has 
been that on eating days, I am able to detect satiety whereas in the past I 
have not been able to do so. I have lost 5lbs in one week. I also enjoy the 
freedom from worrying, measuring, counting points/calories etc. It is nice not 
to be concerned with food for 24 hour intervals. Thank you so 
much&hellip;another thing i noticed is that my taste buds have 
returned&hellip;.my eating habits were so messed up that I could no longer 
taste food&hellip;.it is a gift to be able to relish and meal&hellip;I am 
forty-eight years old and I assume the weight gain I experienced over the last 
five years is partly the result of aging but I am confident I will continue to 
lose weight&hellip;thanks again, Natalie</p>

<p>Dr. Mike, I was doing my regular fast yesterday and had a headache 2 hours 
before it was time to break my fast. I was going to eat earlier than usual 
because of that but I took the ketogenic cocktail in Dr. McCleary&rsquo;s book

<p>Hi Dr. Mike -<br>
 Thanks for the informative website, posting and 
information, as well as &ldquo;Protein Power,&rdquo; all of which have been so 
helpful in my ongoing quest for health and a thin, lean body!<br>
 I&rsquo;ve 
been experimenting with various forms of intermittent fasting consistently 
since June 1 (2008). My goal is to lose 5 pounds and keep it off, which seems 
like it should be easy, but I&rsquo;ve tried many approaches over the last few 
years and none have worked. I maintained my ideal weight (5-8 pounds less than 
I am now, more toward the bottom of a healthy BMI for me) for 4 years just 
prior to this so I know it can be done!<br>
 I was really hoping IF would be 
the answer but so far I haven&rsquo;t lost any weight at all. Overall, whether 
fasting or not, my routine tends to be this: very low calorie, low carb 
(between 500 and 1200 calories depending on whether I am fasting) Mon -Thurs, 
and 5-6 days a week of intense exercise. I do tend to eat much more (and more 
carbs) on Saturdays and Sundays. But my average daily caloric intake over the 
last 2 months has been no more than 1500 calories. According to every 
&ldquo;formula&rdquo; I should be losing weight, but I&rsquo;ve learned to 
discount the formulas and do what works for my body. The problem is I 
can&rsquo;t figure out what works.<br>
 Do you have any advice? I&rsquo;ve 
thought about doing 1-2 36 hour fasts each week as a way to further reduce my 
weekly caloric intake, because I find that easier than trying to stick to a 
1200 calorie a day diet 7 days a a week. Eating is a big part of my social life 
on the weekends and it is VERY difficult to stick to 1200 calories a day when 
eating out, going to social events, celebrating holidays etc. But I find it 
very easy to greatly restrict calories during the week.<br>
 I am concerned 
however about slowing my metabolism. I&rsquo;ve read (Eat Stop Eat, Brad Pilon) 
that this is not the case.<br>
 I would be grateful for any thoughts you have, 
whenever you have time.<br>
 Thank you!<br>
 RLW</p> 
<p><em>I suspect your problem is arising from your weekend eating pattern. Our 
bodies (including our brains) are sort of giant computers that keep track of 
all the dieting we have done. If we&rsquo;ve never dieted, almost anything 
works in helping us lose weight. Once we&rsquo;ve dieted a bit, however, things 
change. The body isn&rsquo;t so easily fooled. If we eat anything and 
everything we want at all times, our bodies go into blow-off-excess-energy 
mode. If then we curtail our food intake, our bodies continue to inefficiently 
burn calories and we lose weight like crazy. For a while. But then our bodies 
get smart and start using calories more efficiently and hanging onto weight, 
and our loss slows or even stops. If, as in your case, the intelligence of the 
body and brain have figured out that all it has to do is hang on until the 
weekend when it will again be fed, it will hold on to the weight and wait you 
out. I fear you&rsquo;re going to have to suck it up and diet through a few 
weekends to get the weight-loss wheels turning. Or simply be content with 
trading the extra five pounds for the benefits being able to eat what you want 
on the weekends brings you.</em></p> Reply <br>

<p>Dear Dr. Eades,</p> 
<p>I had been aware of the calorie restriction research of McCay in the 1930s 
since my medical school when I took an elective course (~1959). I followed that 
literature somewhat and stayed current with the workings of genes so was 
galvanized in May 2003 when I learned that a gene was activated by the calorie 
restriction, learning that intermittant fasting might produce the same results 
as calorie restriction in rodents. Plus resveratrol also turned on that gene. 
So I began weekly day-long fasts (supper of day one, no eating except for 
coffee and wine on day 2 and commenced eating breakfast on day three) and did 
this until August 2004 when I returned from Europe heavier than I wished. I 
reasoned then that since it was so easy to do this once weekly I could do it 
more often and then did from two to three days per week for over a year. 
I&rsquo;ve lost track of exactly then I shifted from that regimen to alternate 
day fasting, to what I read that you and MD did for a few weeks. I allowed 
myself somewhat greater flexibility in order to suit social events, as follows:
</p> 
<p>Sometimes it&rsquo;s an early dinner with a later one 24 or more hours 
later, but typically it&rsquo;s an early breakfast (I and my wife note the 
time) and then a later one 24 or more hours later. The regimen is that I 
commence a 24 hour fast almost every day. Thus, as today when I eat with a 
friend at lunch, I&rsquo;ll commence my fast today and it&rsquo;ll go through 
tomorrow afternoon. I tolerate it better because I sip coffee all the time, 
caffeinated in the morning and decaf in the afternoon. I drink a glass or two 
of wine, a beer, or even scotch in the evening (after I&rsquo;ve done my 
driving for the day!), this alcohol my only calories in the 24 hours.</p> 
<p>I try for one hour of strenuous exercise per day, as at the gym once or 
twice a week, which includes weight work, cross trainer and treadmill. Other 
days I do an hour walk or a total of an hour on nordic track. As an artist now 
who puts up lots of shows, I sometimes spend many hours doing less extensive 
exercise that nevertheless &ldquo;counts.&rdquo; One day/week I allow myself to 
not do it.</p> 
<p>My motives entail health, weight control (I&rsquo;m 20 lb lighter now than 
Aug 04) and energy (calorie restricted animals can go longer in running wheel 
conditions before they drop), and less on the longevity itself. If I have 
health and energy, then longer life&rsquo;s ok; I&rsquo;ll take it. I read a 
factoid somewhere that the CR animals tend to drop over dead without the toll 
of chronic disease. My internist is happy with my regimen as my lipid indices 
look good. I have great energy and enjoy health and many interests.</p> 
<p>I tend to eat freely on eating days, and as you pointed out, it tastes very 
good then! Someone cracked that there is no spice like appetite! So true.</p> 
<p>One of the correspondents mentioned social pressure to eat as others do. I 
have no trouble on that score in that I&rsquo;m willing to let folks think me 
weird. I&rsquo;m an artist after all after a career as an academic physician 
who no longer sees patients but contributes to the scientific literature 
(Indeed, on completion and submission of this, I need to get back to work on a 
paper that has a deadline!) Some colleagues/friends would have their family 
life disrupted. Being 70 and living away from my adult children and 
grandchildren, I find them tolerant and admiring even. My wife does not also 
fast, but feels relieved at the lessened meal preparation (she does our cooking 
and this constitutes my way of contributing to the household efforts in 
addition to cleaning dishes). She is thin and exercises so we together have a 
high energy life style. We eat out a lot.</p> 
<p>Both of us for approximately the past year have been persuaded by Colin 
Campbell&rsquo;s plant based diet ideas and are more or less vegan. I never 
cheat on the fasting but do take fish oil tablets for their omega-3 content, do 
eat butter as well as an occasional bacon side order and otherwise do a less 
fanatic vegan diet of no animal proteins or animal-derived proteins. Not for 
religious reasons such as sympathy for animals but for health reasons. 
I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;re familiar with the China Study book. On the occasion 
I&rsquo;ve done a protein feast and then felt nauseous afterwards for a reason 
that I reason may have to do with my gall bladder being less active.</p> 
<p>In summary I have done at least once weekly day-long fasting for over five 
years and this extended to alternate day 24-hour fasting for approximately 2 or 
3 years. So far my goals of health, weight control and good energy have been 
realized along with no social or family negative consequences. I do not feel 
hungry on fasting days and simply forget that I&rsquo;m doing it, with projects 
filling in mealtimes. My wife spends more time with her twin sister often while 
I can remain at the studio with my projects.</p> Reply <br>

 I have been reading a lot 
about this IF method, but failed to find a good explanation on why it is a 
healthy practice? I understand that when it comes to the amount of calories 
consumed, the average number is what matters, but why is it healthy? And why is 
it considered a method that helps people loss weight?</p> 
<p><em>No one really knows. My guess is that it allows the liver (the 
metabolic master organ) have a chance to rest and rehabilitate. Plus it brings 
about the state of ketosis on fasting days, and more and more it is beginning 
to be realized that ketones provide better fuel than most anything else. Veech 
(a major ketone researcher) has shown that the heart runs 29 percent more 
efficienty on ketones. Plus, ketones reduce reductive stress (a difficult 
concept to grasp, but one I need to post on someday), which will increase 
longevity.</em></p> Reply <br>

<p>Curious as to why reference to SIRT1 genes that produce sirtuin proteins 
omitted in your response on September 6. These activate with resveratrol as 
well as with calorie restriction to cause the body to assume, metaphorically 
described, a thrift economy rather than a wastral-affluent economy. Does 
intermitttant fasting stimulate these genes too? I&rsquo;m betting on it but in 
the meantime, whether or not it does, the side benefit of reduced weight that I 
seen as a likely result of simply eating less with the every other day diet 
feels good as do my improved lipid levels.</p> 
<p>Discussion of ketones as fuel reminds me of the natural gas vs oil/gasoline 
debates! Funny</p> 
<p><em>I&rsquo;m sure the SIRT1 genes are involved, and I would bet that IF 
stimulates them. Thanks for bringing it up. I just didn&rsquo;t want my answer

<p>So I am trying to lose weight. I am 165, 22 Female, and only 
5&rsquo;2&rdquo;. I am trying to get back to 125. I love food, and get very 
moody and pissed off at the world (just like those rats! ha ha!) because 
I&rsquo;m stuck eating a little bit of food every 3 hours. Its such a relief on 
my cheat day to just relax and not have to keep looking at the clock to see if 
its been 3 hours. Anyway, I have been aiming at a very low 1300 calories day to 
lose weight, it works, but I HATE it. So in two days I would consume 2600 
calories.</p> 
<p>So if I tried IF, am I correct to think I would only consume say 800 or 
maybe a little less one day, then 1800 the next, and so on? Would this work 
too? What do you say? Or should I just do it the way you did it and fast a day 
until 6 pm, have dinner, wake up, eat breakfast, eat lunch, snack and eat 
dinner, then fast and not eat until 6 pm the next day?</p> 
<p>Let me know! Thanks!</p>

<p>Dr. Eades, </p> 
<p>Perhaps this was already addressed years ago (literally) but in your post 
(I found it through IronOnline) you wrote, &ldquo;When researchers restrict the 
caloric intake of a group of lab animals to about 30 to 40 percent of that of 
their ad libitum (all they want to eat) fed counterparts &hellip; &rdquo; the 
CR animals lived 30 percent longer.</p> 
<p>In the next paragraph you wrote, &ldquo;it stands to reason that if humans 
reduced their caloric intake by 30-40 percent for their entire lives, they 
would also live longer.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>But the way you wrote the post, they didn&rsquo;t restrict it 30 to 40 
percent &#151; they restricted it TO 30 to 40 percent of the total &hellip; 
meaning they restricted it by 60 to 70 percent. Did you mean all the numbers to 
be 30 to 40 percent:</p> 
<p>* 30 to 40 percent fewer calories (the study)<br>
 * 30 to 40 percent 
longer life (for the thusly CRed animals)<br>
 * 30 to 40 percent fewer 
calories (for human) would lead to longer life</p> 
<p>?</p> 
<p>Thank,</p>

<p><em>I meant restricted by 30-40 percent. It would mean they would consume 
60-70 percent of their former ad lib diet. Sorry for the confusion.</em></p>

<p>44 year-old male here. My experience &ndash; all positive &ndash; so far.
</p> 
<p>I started intemittent fasting in August 2005, so at time of typing, 
I&rsquo;ve been doing it for</p> 
<p>THREE YEARS, FOUR MONTHS</p> 
<p>The regime is simple &ndash; eat one day, NOTHING the next, so including 
sleeping hours, it works out at 14/34 in terms of hours eating/hours fasting 
for every 48 hour period. The only things I consume during fasting days are 
water, tea and coffee (no sugar!) with a tiny bit of milk.</p> 
<p>I also excercise, burning off 1000 calories in 55 minutes on a lateral 
trainer, on fasting or eating days, there&rsquo;s no effect on my ability to do 
so. At the moment, I&rsquo;ve slipped to just once a week, but I also briskly 
walk a minimum of twenty miles each week.</p> 
<p>Benefits:</p> 
<p>Weight: Lost 30 lbs during the first year, nothing after, but if I up the 
exercise, I do lose more. My weight is therefore remarkably stable for someone 
who has in the past fluctuated quite a bit when not exercising.</p> 
<p>Pulse: Has been down to 47, usually averages 60.</p> 
<p>Blood Pressure: 120/70 &ndash; not that impressive, one study showed an 
average for this diet of 100/60.</p> 
<p>Blood Sugar: Low.</p> 
<p>Food: You really appreciate it more. Eating daily, you just take it for 
granted.</p> 
<p>Time: An extra two to three hours spare time on fasting days.</p> 
<p>Illness: NONE. Colds &ndash; NONE. Flues &ndash; NONE. Coughs &ndash; NONE.
</p> 
<p>The last seems to be the most remarkable benefit of this regime. And 
you&rsquo;ll only be hungry for the first seven or eight months. After that, 
it&rsquo;s a breeze.</p> 
<p><em>Thanks for the dietary history. It&rsquo;s nice to see how different

<p>Dr. Eads, I am confused.</p> 
<p>I read with great interest you post above and people&rsquo;s great 
experiences with IF. However, when I followed the link to you article on this 
site:
http://www.fourhourworkweek.com/blog/2008/03/03/real-life-extension-caloric-restriction-or-intermittent-fasting-part-2/
</p> 
<p>I found the following at the end of Part II:</p> 
<p>&ldquo;It&#146;s looking like the intermittent fast is another of those 
ideas in science that looks good in animal studies then not so good in human 
studies, proving once again that rats and mice aren&#146;t simply furry little 
humans. And it appears &ndash; for humans, at least &ndash; that the 
intermittent fast is indeed beginning to look like the reality of a late-night 
gimmicky infomercial: long on promises, short on delivery. I suspect that it is 
also a cautionary tale about the applicability of caloric restriction studies 
to humans.</p> 
<p>Sorry to be the bearer of bad news, but that&#146;s the way science 
sometimes works. Lab results and reality are often two different animals.&rdquo;
</p> 
<p>So, what is your current recommendation on IF? Is it worthy or the result 
of human study which you mention (&ldquo;Papers appeared showing that subjects 
IFing, or even regularly skipping a couple of meals per day, were developing 
insulin resistance, impaired glucose tolerance, elevated blood pressure, and 
decreased thermogenesis&rdquo;) negate the value of IFing?</p> 
<p>I&rsquo;d appreciate your clarification</p> 
<p><em>The jury is still out on the subject. I&rsquo;m going to do another 
post on IF soon, so I&rsquo;ll give you an update then.</em></p> Reply <br>

<p>Following the warrior diet for two weeks now. Fantastic results. Trememdous 
energy, fat loss, mental clarity, breathing better. I have a lot of weight to 
lose, but will not weigh to avoid moood swings and since the benefits of this 
is so much more than weight loss. One pecular note is, for years I have had 
very brief, very clotty, very painful periods. This month the cramps and all 
the other symptoms were greatly relieved, and my period is light and clot free, 
but it seems to be going on much longer. Im use to a three day period, this one 
has lasted almost two weeks. This morning it seems its stopping finally. Can 
this possibly be to the fact that I have been insulin resistant for so long and 
now Im stirring things up? Ive had tremendous stress over the last six months, 
storm related displacement, job loss, friends scattered. May be stress and then 
the diet has things changing.</p>

<p>Just a note to report that today, for the first time in my 39 years, I 
comfortably did sprints throughout my 45 minute walk. I have been over weight 
and energy compromised ever since childhood. Running with freedom and energy 
instead of pain and dread is something I&rsquo;ve literally dreamed about, but 
never experienced until today. To have this kind of phycial development a few 
months before you turn 40 is truly mind boggling. Words fail me in trying to 
express my gratfulness to the warrior diet, and all the outspoken people who go 
out on a limb and state their reality, no matter how much it goes against the 
grain of the current beliefs. Thanks everyone!!!</p> Reply <br>

<p>Hi doc!</p> 
<p>Thanks for your interesting blog. We are very much interested in IF, but a 
few worries remain:</p> 
<p>1 How will it affect someone who is already underweight? I definitely do 
not want my husband to loose any more weight, he is 60 kg and 1.84 m tall. 
There are no known health problems.</p> 
<p>2 Personally I want to stick to my diet of fruits, steamed vegetables, 
salads, nuts and seeds. I am looking at the volume of the needed food every 
alternate day, which seems too much, I already feel it is high volume even when 
not doing IF. Do you know of people who have done this? Do you have any 
recommendations?</p> 
<p>Eagerly awaiting your reply!<br>
 Thank you!</p>

<p>Here is an update on my progress. This is how I now define my eating 
lifestyle&hellip;my dietary lifestyle is low carb all the way. Intermittent 
fasting is how I control my meal frequencies and it is what I use to keep my 
weight at healthy levels. I began IF in 2007 to lose my regained weight. I knew 
that it would be slow going because of my age and the the character of my body. 
Now, I can say that the results are astounding. I went from 166 lbs to 136 lbs 
( on good days ). What I love the most about IF is when it is time to eat I 
literally pig-out. I don&rsquo;t think about portion control, I have increased 
the amount of fats in my food. I drink heavy cream in my coffee. I also drink 
coconut milk smoothies in which I add whey protein powder and mct oil. I have 
plenty of energy to get me through the day and I am pleasant at work. I caught 
my reflection in the window today at work and I really liked what I saw. I have 
had no illnesses ( no colds or flu ). My gums are pink. I am African-American 
and read where it is normal for &ldquo;us&rdquo; to have dark gums. My gums had 
flecks of black or blue throughout my mouth. Now they are totally pink. That 
was something I had not expected at all so I am not sure if it is due to the 
dietary lifestyle, the fats or my braces. I don&rsquo;t know but I am being 
transformed.</p> 
<p>I am planning to work up to a 5K run just to see if it can be done. I also 
want to compare it to my other runs.</p> 
<p>That&rsquo;s it for now,<br>

<p>Don&rsquo;t mean to hog the blog , but had a pretty big event today. Did my 
usual sprinting at my walking session. Felt stronger than ever. Later, before I 
broke my fast, I decided to do a few minutes trying out some kettlebell moves. 
Very heavy weight 12kg. wellllllllll The exercise itself was exhilarating. I 
punched it out as hard as I possibly could, felt great. Collapsed on the 
couch,,,,,very pleased with myself, then started tingling in my extremities, 
even my lips and tongue. No SOB, no chest pain, maybe a little light headed 
later after I started to freak out over the tingling. Just got online and can 
see that it could have been low blood sugar, low calcium. Feeling much better 
now, but may forgo the more intense weight training until I develop more 
endurance??</p> 
<p><em>My bet would be low-blood sugar. Working out intensely requires a lot 
of blood sugar, since most such workouts are anaerobic. Blood sugar can fall in 
a hurry, sometimes more quickly than your liver can replace it. And you 
experience the symptoms you described. As you do such exercises more, you 
should grease the skids of your metabolism so that this doesn&rsquo;t happen as 
often or as severely.</em></p> Reply <br>

<p>Is there any reason to be concerned about vitamin/mineral intake problems 
with the addition of fasting days? The traditional notion is that we need a 
certain amount of vitamins and minerals each DAY in order to maintain strong 
health. Would you say that this is perhaps an oversimplification and that the 
body can function healthily with a more random scheduling of vitamin/mineral 
intake? Or, on the other hand, should an IFer reasonably be concerned about 
negatively impacting their intake?</p> 
<p><em>Many IFers take daily vitamins. Since these are non-caloric, they

<p>I have a question! I have been IFing since Jan 1st. I&#146;m eating once a 
day between 2-3 pm. I am eating what I normally would during this time. 
Chicken, pasta, turkey burgers&#133; any type of turkey dishes (turkey 
meatballs w. spaghetti), one night i had tacos.. with turkey instead of beef. I 
don&#146;t eat any sweets because I&#146;m usually full once I&#146;m finished 
eating my meal. I also work out for 40 minutes 5 days a week. I started at 
125lbs and so far I&#146;ve only lost 1lb! Does anyone have any good advice on 
what more I could be doing to increase my weight loss?? I feel alot better 
since I&#146;ve began but I&#146;d like to see a little more weight loss. 
Please help, and thanks!</p>

<p>We have been doing IF for 7 days now. It is an experiment. We will see 
where it will take us!<br>
 Now we have a question. Does it make sense to have 
fasting and eating days on fixed days of the week? That would involve either 4 
fasting and 3 eating days &lsquo;every&rsquo; week, or 3 fasting and 4 eat days 
&lsquo;every&rsquo; week. Do you see the point? Rather than a scheme which 
involves 2 weeks. It would be much more practical for us to have our fixed 
fasting days, but since that involves eating for 2 days in a row once a week, 
does that disturb the body in any way? Does it matter? I can imagine when the 
body is expecting a fast, and then you eat, that it does not take that nicely. 
What do you think?</p>

<p>Dr. Mike,</p> 
<p>Something that I have been pondering is- if the body is in ketosis, and 
ketosis is as efficient as you say, wouldn&rsquo;t the body be better equipped 
to absorb nutrients ? For one, the cells are not clogged with an over abundance 
of glucose plus ketones are aplenty. The organs are functioning at their peak 
performance. It just seems to me that ketosis would increase one&rsquo;s 
ability to absorb nutrients.</p> 
<p>Mary</p> 
<p><em>There is a difference between absorbing nutrients and absorbing 
calories. If all systems are working better &ndash; including the digestive 
tract &ndash; nutrients would be more likely to be better absorbed. Calories 
would also be absorbed, but would get burned off more easily during ketogenesis.

<p>lost 15lbs in one month of IF&rsquo;ing~ body composition is much changed 
so Im sure this is a fat loss as opposed to my former losses of 
water/muscle/fat. lowering intensity of resistance training has decreased my 
post workout tingling sensation to the bottoms of my feet, so the blood sugar 
theory was spot on. will keep intensity lower until my body adjusts in few 
weeks/months. took a break in week four, took two days of random junkfood to 
get back to pre warrior diet lethargy, cravings, and foggy thinking. took two 
more days of IT&rsquo;ing to get back to the &ldquo;runners high&rdquo; 
&ldquo;fatty acid flush&rdquo; energy levels i had gotten used to. Ive decided 
that for me, the best way to cheat and enjoy pleasure foods from now on is to 
eat them in my window at night. eating during the day is simply too disturbing

<p>tangent question: since in all my readings you seem to be the most 
intelligent, with fewer ideologies, ill ask you this, if you deplete your 
glycogen stores in a couple of weeks of IT&rsquo;ing, and then the body 
switches to a different fuel source ie fatty acids and ketones, will you stop 
using ketones if you eat more than 100 carbs a day? i do eat more than 100 
carbs a day. i am a recovering carb junky and don&rsquo;t feel a need to be in 
ketosis for my primary goals. do you see any extra benefits from keeping your 
carb count so low?</p> 
<p><em>You sure know how to butter a guy up. </em></p> <em> </em> 
<p><em>You may or may not stop producing a lot of ketones at 100 g carbs per 
day. Most people, even if they are on a higher carb diet (unless they graze all 
the time) will be producing some ketones at times throughout the day. If you 
are doing okay moving toward your primary goal (whatever that may be) I 
don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s all that necessary to be in ketosis all day long.

<p>Dear Dr. Eades, </p> 
<p>After 10 months of strict alternate fasting (24hrs eating, 24hrs fasting) 
my metabolic profile does not look like it is improving.</p> 
<p>As I understand it, the reason why alternate fasting is thought to make 
people live longer and better is because it positively affects the metabolic 
profile. Since that is not changing I wonder if you&#146;d be so kind as to 
tell me whether you would recommend sticking with intermittent fasting for 
another while or trying something else, such as caloric restriction?</p>

<p>Here is something that I have noticed. Back when I was weighing 142 lbs. My 
waistline hovered between 30&rdquo; and 32&rdquo;. I gained about 24 lbs within 
a 2 year period. I began to implement IF and I last weighed in at 145 lbs ( my 
weight fluctuates a lot ). But my waist is 29 inches. Also, when I began IF I 
was low carbing&hellip;I will always be a low carber. I believe that my carbs 
are around 30 grams/day plus I increased my fats. I add fats to my diet every

<p>It is interesting to consider that our current &lsquo;educated&rsquo; 
society is one of the only times throughout history where fasting of any kind 
is shunned.</p> 
<p>In most societies, both eastern and western, periods of fasting where 
common. Generally it was one day of fasting per week.</p> 
<p>It is hard to say the effects of this, and whether this stems from 
religion, a lack of food or a health benefit is anyones guess. (Religions for 
some reason have always encouraged fasting?)</p> 
<p>As usual, I&rsquo;m keen to try this, but I can just imagine the reaction 
of other people. My family would go on about how it is &ldquo;unhealthy&rdquo; 
until I finally eat something just to shut them up.<br>

feed, i will do the eatstopeat approach and do a overt fast. workouts on both 
days went fantastic. no low blood sugar symptoms, energy levels high. my body 
must be adjusting quickly to the program im on, a combination of fast 
five/warrior principles. im so impressed with my results ive decided to 
incorporate this weekly fast permenately. ive read visceral fat release is more 
responsive to calorie restriction than exercise, so this my expedite my belly 
lose. i would much rather fast a day or two a week than eat light meals. just 
my weakness.</p> Reply <br>

<p>Hi! Great blog. I have read every single comment and I want to try this but 
I am still very curious about the &ldquo;technical stuff.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>I was wondering- does the process of muscle wasting only occur after all 
fat stores are used up or is there a specific point (varied, I assume, from 
person to person) after which fasting for so many hours/days where muscle is 
used for energy? If so, would it then be more effective to fast to this point 
and then begin re-feeding so that fat stores have dissolved and lean muscle 
mass remains intact?</p> 
<p>So much of what I have read says that fasting, at any length past 3 hours 
to maybe 24 it seems, means that your next meal, regardless of what it is 
comprised of fat/carb/protein, will be stored as fat&hellip; or something along 
the lines of- your body is more sensitive post-fast to calories somehow and 
shifts to &ldquo;fat storing mode&rdquo; in response to the fast.</p> 
<p>I have also read that anorexics (And yes, I understand this is a different 
thing than IF all together) can start out with a normal BMI and become severely 
underweight but that during recovery they gain back the weight very quickly, 
usually in the form of fat. Is this because of the types of food that they are 
required to eat in a re-feeding plan? Or does it have to do with the 
body&rsquo;s own response (being more sensitive) to storing calories as fat 
after a long period of under-eating? I was curious about what you have to say 
about that.</p> 
<p>It seems that the IF approach combined with LC eating on the non fast days 
would be optimal when it comes to the burning of stored fat. I am already an LC 
eater and am eager to add IF to my routine. How long can this usually be done 
before a plateau occurs or will a person continue to lose weight consistently 
and perhaps reach an unhealthy underweight state? If anything, I assume this 
varies from person to person&hellip; so I guess I&rsquo;ll give it a go and see 
what happens with my own bod.</p> 
<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>Muscle loss doesn&rsquo;t occur after the loss of fat stores, but after the 
loss of glycogen stores. Muscle is the repository of amino acids, which are 
converted to glucose in the gluconeogenic process. If you are IFing, you 
shouldn&rsquo;t lose much &ndash; if any &ndash; muscle mass, and any you might 
lose will get picked back up the next day.</p> </em> 
<p><em>It is not true that if you fast for any length of time, whatever you 
regain will all fat. When people do go on long-term severely restricted diets 
(anorexics, for example), they drop their metabolic rates. When they refeed, 
they tend to put more on as fat simply because they have adapted to the 
lower-caloric intake. The nice thing about IFing is that typically people eat 
enough on the eat days to prevent their metabolic rate from plummeting.</em></p>

<p>Fascinating stuff. I already eat very healthily (Vegan) but this could

<p>Too much fruit sugar I guess, I never eat processed stuff apart from rye

<p>I just started IF this week. Today would be my 2nd fast day and so far no 
problem. I do have a question though, is it okay to eat sugar-free gum or candy 
during fast days. And what other beverages could be consumed during fast days 
besides water?</p>

so with the sugar-free candy. I would leave it alone. Any non-caloric beverage

<p>Quick question! Do you believe there could be any benefit to drinking green 
tea during the fasting phase, purely to relieve any of the metabolism slow-down 
of which we are constantly warned?</p>

<p>Sorry to blog on a forum but: Wow! I did two weeks of every other day 
fasting, along with my nightly eating window. The window of eating has been the 
key to maintaining any ground Ive gained on my overt water fasts. It was 
aggressive and it was challenging, but Im so happy to report that the two weeks 
of intermittent water fasting has totally knocked out my almost constant pms 
cramps. The estrogen dumping must have been amped up considerably. The tingly 
low blood sugar/pressure (?) has been totally alleviated even though I keep 
uping the intensity of my exercise. Im dealing with a little nausea in the am, 
and some mucus expelling from the lungs, bowels, but its all detox and I 
welcome it. Eating in my window every night for the last week has simply 
continued the cleansing process to a deeper level. The first half of my window 
is all raw, fruits/veggies. I marvel at how much cleansing and healing can take 
place without overt fasting for days and weeks on end. Truly awesome!</p>

<p>Hi There,</p> 
<p>I&rsquo;ve read a lot of your posts and really like to give this a try. One 
of my vice&rsquo;s is diet cola drinks.<br>
 I see that you say non caloric 
drinks are fine but I&rsquo;ve recently read how sweeteners (aspartame, etc.) 
slow down the fat burning process as they over work the liver etc and you 
don&rsquo;t get rid of the fat. What are your thoughts?</p> 
<p>Thanks</p> 
<p><em>I don&rsquo;t drink diet drinks with aspartame, but not because they 
prevent fat burning. I prefer those made with Splenda, but any non-caloric 
beverage shouldn&rsquo;t cause a problem with the IF.</em></p> Reply <br>

<p>Here is something that I have been doing&hellip;I add about a tablespoon of 
MCT oil to my morning coffee. Although it does have calories it goes directly 
to the liver causing a rapid ketone increase. If I am not mistaken, isn&rsquo;t 
this unique to other caloric sources? I have a sustained energy boost 
throughout the day and my mind is clear.</p>

<p>I was introduced to IF as &ldquo;Daily IF&rdquo;, being &ndash; eating 
everyday, but in a shorter window. The ultimate goal being eating everyday but 
all calories in a 4-6 hour window. Therefore I have been on a few days of 
eating only between 3pm and 7pm. I&rsquo;m quite certain my caloric intake is 
somewhat below what it would be if I were eating regularly everyday, however 
energy is fine so far. I train in crossfit everyday and haven&rsquo;t yet 
noticed a decrease in performance. I would be interested in your comments on 
Daily IF as opposed to &ldquo;day on day off&rdquo;..</p>

<p>I read about this on Monday of this week and thought I&rsquo;d give it a 
try starting Tuesday (I fasted on Tuesday). I&rsquo;m 13st, 6,2&Prime;, male, 
under 25, and not very active (I work from home, on my computer, and get very 
little exercise as I&rsquo;m not involved in team sport / enrolled to the local 
gym).<br>
 I&rsquo;ve been drinking sugar-free squash (checked the nutritional 
label, only contains trace amounts of anything) and water on fasting days, and 
as you mentioned in your article (this had only vaguely occurred to me) 
I&rsquo;ve been fasting for over 24 hours at a time.<br>
 I was somewhat 
relieved to read your answer regarding protein; I too was under the impression 
that if I were to do this long-term, on fasting days my body would gradually 
eat away at lean tissue, leaving fat tissue.<br>
 On Tuesday I felt a little 
lightheaded and at one point, nauseous, but not at all hungry. For most of the 
afternoon I had a headache, but it wasn&rsquo;t bad enough that it stopped me 
from working, nor disturbed my sleep (I still had it as I fell to sleep). I 
didn&rsquo;t take anything for it because I didn&rsquo;t know if paracetamol 
might be harmful on an empty stomach!<br>
 I say I wasn&rsquo;t hungry at all, 
I didn&rsquo;t have a stomach ache, but it was very mild, and entirely 
tolerable.<br>
 On Wednesday I ate Subway for breakfast, fried mushrooms bacon 
x2 and eggs x2 for lunch (cooked in a non-stick frying pan so I didn&rsquo;t 
add any oil) and half a large seasoned rotisserie chicken (from the 
supermarket; already cooked and still hot) with about 130g of salad (I&rsquo;m 
lazy, so I buy bags of salad). And several slices of granary bread. Apologies 
for the excessive detail!<br>
 Today I&rsquo;ve eaten nothing, experienced no 
lightheadedness (is that a word&hellip;) or nausea or headaches, and although 
my stomach feels a little hungry, not particularly. Incidentally, I&rsquo;ve 
been drinking about 3 litres of water a day; some of that from green tea but 
none from carbonated/caffeinated beverages. Ordinarily I drink perhaps one 
litre a day, so this is a marked improvement. I&rsquo;m not particularly health 
conscious; I&rsquo;m doing this in aid of the prospective increase in cognitive 
ability, and reduction in the effects of stress, both of which would be greatly 
beneficial!<br>

<p>Hi. I&rsquo;ve combined daily IF with skipping eating windows 
occassionally. so far so great. just takes it a step further. if you skip 
eating window to eating window, you basically have about a forty to forty three 
hour fast. it was very effective for me. but only did it for two weeks. now im 
back to eating everynight for now. daily fast have done wonderfuls for me, and 
that may be optimal for someone so atheletic. you just have to try things out 
and see how you personal respond. i was quite tired the day after i skipped my 
window, but im not a big trainer, so no harm for me.</p> Reply <br>

<p>Back again.. on week two of intermittent fasting. I have to say, I am blown 
away by how much food I was eating before. I hate to say, but mindlessly 
eating, or eating because the clock said 8:00 am 12 noon and 5pm oh and those 
&ldquo;snacks&rdquo; your supposed to get in to make up the 5-6 smaller meals a 
day. I have not been hungry and so not eating until physically felt hungry. 
Easily able to sustain until 2-3 pm in the afternoon and then eating a good 
paleo meal and snacks for 4 or 5 hours. I&rsquo;m full going to bed, not waking 
hungry and have found a few extra hours of time during the day because morning 
isn&rsquo;t held up by making breakfast, and lunch isn&rsquo;t an hour long 
break anymore. I&rsquo;ve definately noticed a shift in body shape, a little 
lighter and never bloated! It&rsquo;s so easily tweaked too, if the day calls 
for a certain lunch appointment I just start at noon and end at 4 or 5, of if I 
have to go out for a later dinner, just start later in the day&hellip;. so easy 
and effective.</p> Reply <br>

<p>Hi Dr. Eades,</p> 
<p>I have been reading your blog &amp; every single comment for the past 2 
days &amp; nights. I just discovered IF after many, what some might call failed 
attempts to complete 10 days on the Master Cleanse (the most I could ever do if 
7 days) but the mental part of it kills me every time! I just become a basket 
case.</p> 
<p>On March 1st 09, I decided to do my own version of IF where I drink 1 
&ndash; 3 glasses of the MC lemonade (1 tbsp organic maple syrup or blackstrap 
molasses or agave nectur, 2 tbsp lemon juice &amp; a pinch of cayenne pepper) 
and/or fruit juice on 2 1/2 fasting days (totally about 150cals) and eat 
whatever I want for dinner on the 3rd day. So far, as of this morning, I have 
lost pounds 3.8 pounds</p> 
<p>I noticed a huge low carb following here and that you only drank water 
&amp; black coffee on your fasting days. I don&rsquo;t plan on staying with the 
MC lemonade part of it once I reach my goal weight but the 2 cups of fruit 
juice a day on fasting days I would like to be a staple.</p> 
<p>Do you think me having the sugar from the syrup or blackstrap molasses or 
juice poses a problem for my future success?</p> 
<p><em>It all depends upon what you&rsquo;re eating overall. I don&rsquo;t 
think whatever minuscule benefits you might get from the tiny amount of 
vitamins and minerals in the syrup or molasses is more than offset by the sugar.

<p>Hi again Dr. Eades -</p> 
<p>I wrote to you back in August and you posted a great reply, thank you. 
I&rsquo;m still finding the whole topic of IF and this blog so interesting.</p> 
<p>I wanted to provide an update and ask further questions. I&rsquo;ve been 
experimenting with various forms of IF and calorie reduction since August 2008. 
My goal has been and continues to be losing 5 pounds and keeping it off. I 
suppose I should mention that I weigh 115, and I know you&rsquo;ll say that 
because my weight is already low, it may be hard for me to lose weight. 
However, I&rsquo;m only 5&Prime;2&Prime; and weighed no more than 110 for 
years, which felt like the best weight for me.</p> 
<p>Last fall after I wrote you, and also read some new information about the 
appropriate number of calories I should be consuming to lose weight (pretty low 
given my size), I adjusted my formula to further lower my average weekly 
caloric intake. I find it relatively easy to fast and eat very low calorie 
during the week, so that I can enjoy &ldquo;normal&rdquo; eating on the 
weekends. Not pigging out mind you, but enjoying some wine, bread and 
occasional dessert. It seemed to work &ndash; right before the holidays I 
finally lost those 5 pounds.</p> 
<p>Well I put it back on during the holidays (so much work and time to get it 
off, so fast to put it back on), so in January I started back up on my regimen. 
It&rsquo;s now been nearly 8 weeks and I haven&rsquo;t lost a pound. (It took 
about 8 weeks in the fall to lose 4 pounds).</p> 
<p>I re-read your comments from August and am thinking my body must be on to 
my routine &ndash; and maybe it won&rsquo;t work as well now. But my question 
is this: how is what I&rsquo;m doing different from the success so many people 
have with IF? If your body doesn&rsquo;t &ldquo;hang on to fat&rdquo; during 
IF, why would mine be holding out knowing it will get &ldquo;fed&rdquo; on 
weekends? Isn&rsquo;t it simply a matter of calories in and calories out? If my 
caloric weekly average is 1350 shouldn&rsquo;t I be losing weight &ndash; it 
worked last fall. And, before I started this regimen, I was able to maintain 
115 while eating quite a bit more calories during the week, so it just 
doesn&rsquo;t make sense that I&rsquo;m not losing now.</p> 
<p>I&rsquo;m nearing the point of just accepting this weight for the trade off 
of being able to have some treats on the weekends, but I&rsquo;m not quite 
there yet. I really want to understand the science of this &ndash; it just 
isn&rsquo;t making sense to me.</p> 
<p>I am hell bent to figure this out, and come up with a healthy plan I can 
live with long term. If you have time for new thoughts that would be great!</p> 
<p>Thank you.</p> 
<p><em>It&rsquo;s difficult for me to make an intelligent suggestion because I 
don&rsquo;t know what your low-calorie diet is composed of. It makes a 
difference if it is a low-carb, low-calorie diet or a high-carb, low-calorie 
diet. If it&rsquo;s the latter, I&rsquo;m not surprised your having difficulty. 
It it&rsquo;s the former, I would try to change the regimen around a little. 
And I might be very good for one weekend instead of easing off just to see what 
happens. It might be that you would drop several pounds.</em></p> Reply <br>

<p>Dr. Eades,</p> 
<p>I have been following this lifestyle for a month now and love it; I am 
planning on making it permanent!</p> 
<p>The only question I had regarding my fasting state (8pm-12pm) are BCAA 
allowed? I like to do fasted state cardio in the mornings, but the amino acids 
ensure that no muscle is lost.</p> 
<p>Also, does my plan look okay to you?</p> 
<p>I then break the fast around noon with a protein shake, apple, piece of 
whole wheat bread (10g carbs per slice) w/ a thin layer of peanut butter for 
taste (maybe a teaspoon)</p> 
<p>I workout from 1:30-2:30 and @ 3pm I have my largest meal of the day (~700 
calories) composed of mainly protein/carbs/ and only a small amount of fat. 
Then I have a light dinner around 8.</p>

<p>I would like to include the fact that I donated blood to my husband for an 
upcoming surgery. Everything was fine. What surprised me was my iron was good 
despite the fact that I was on my monthly. Also I was not dehydrated despite 
the fact that I am not very thirsty and drink very little water. I drank a 
little more because of the blood draw but it was not much more than my usual 
intake. As of this weekend I have been doing intermittent fasting for 2 years.

<p>My roommate and I researched the calorie restriction diet about a year and 
a half ago. It sounds wonderful, and we tried it for a few weeks, but it was so 
much work! tracking every bite we ate, tracking all the micro nutrients, even 
trying to figure out when and how much to eat. the benefits seem fabulous, but 
it isn&rsquo;t a practical diet.<br>
 then a few months ago, my brother did 
EAT-STOP-EAT, a diet ebook published by a nutritionist. he lost 12 lbs over a 
few weeks and said it was really easy, but he only fasted ONCE A WEEK for 24 
hours (the same thing dinner to dinner). I was looking for something a bit more 
rigorous &ndash; i actually need to lose a bit more than 20lbs. I think you and 
your friend&rsquo;s plan is exactly what I&rsquo;m looking for Thanks so much, 
I&rsquo;m going to start tomorrow!!! I&rsquo;ll let you know how it goes and if 
i lose the weight (and how quickly).</p> Reply <br>

<p>Hi Dr. E:</p> 
<p>I absolutely love the idea of the IF; it is right up my alley and seems to 
be very sound! However, my lifestyle doesn&rsquo;t allow for an exact program 
of eating times due to &ldquo;required&rdquo; eating schedule. I was wondering 
if you think the follow system would work:</p> 
<p>Sunday: Eat as per normal<br>
 Monday: Fast (first 24 hour fast)<br>
 
Tuesday: Eat as per normal until 4:30 PM<br>
 Wednesday: East as per normal 
AFTER 4:30 PM (completion of 2nd 24 hour fast)<br>
 Thursday: Fast (3rd 24 hour 
fast)<br>
 Friday: Eat as per normal after 4:30 PM (I&rsquo;m guaranteed to eat 
a LOT on Friday nights, so I extended the previous fast to cover it)<br>
 
Saturday: Eat as per normal.</p> 
<p>So it has 3 24 hour fasts in a week, but a 48 hour periods without fasting. 
Should this still work?</p> 
<p><em>It should. Best thing to do is give it a try to see how it works for 
you.</em></p> Reply <br>

<p>hello dr. eades!</p> 
<p>after reading your updated ideas on IFing, i thought i would add that, 
after IFing for months on end (six to date), im finding it a wonderful 
lifestyle. diet plan not so much. i&rsquo;ve shrunk my eating window from 4-6hr 
to 1-3hrs most weekdays, and incorporated longer, more carb based cheats on the 
weekends. ive lost several pant sizes and continue to lose body fat, but not as 
fast now. it feels to me, that longterm IFing with no overt calorie restriction 
has improved my health and energy levels greatly and is changing the shape of 
my body consistently on a week to week basis. but dreams of drastic reduction 
is short amounts of time have not happened longterm for me. i just love to eat. 
im doing 5oish carbs a night , so ive adopted the more low carb approach. 
thanks for the your blog as it intially helped motivate me in many ways to get 
started. my continued experiment is being documented at<br>

<p>You said in a previous post, &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t force gluconeogenesis 
by eating protein. You only undergo gluconeogenesis if your blood sugar levels 
start to drop too low.&rdquo; Yet, I experience a much higher than usual rise 
in my BG when I eat much more meat than is typical for me on my LC diet &mdash; 
I monitor my BG regularly as diabetes runs in my family. I take no medications 
of any sort and have no health problems.</p> 
<p>I typically eat 1 to 4 oz. meat or other protein per meal or sometimes a 
snack. My pre-meal is usually in the 80s and my post can be up to 105. However, 
if I eat much more than 6 oz meat at a meal, it will easily be 115. This is one 
problem I am trying to work out while doing the IF and even doing the Protein 
Power by the way. With the IF, I know I won&rsquo;t be able to eat all I want 
when the fast is over because it will raise my BG too high even if it is LC. By 
the way, I am 58, female, 5&rsquo;3&Prime;, 130 lbs, very small framed and need 
to lose about 20 pounds from my middle mostly. I am going to start the Slow 
Burn if I can work all this out and do it all in a healthy fashion.</p>

Insulin Resistance related factors cause gluconeogenesis prematurely when a 
certain amount of meat is eaten? It&rsquo;s only when I eat well over 5 oz. 
that my BG rises too high. What can I do to get enough protein without causing 
this reaction? How can I get enough protein if I do the IF?</p>

<p>Hi Dr. Eades,<br>
 Fantastic study! I am a personal trainer and so I am 
always experimenting on myself with various things, just to get a feel and 
understand different things. I am currently trying my most extreme experiment 
which is water fasting for five days (I&rsquo;m done tomorrow). I have been 
reading all i can about fasting and really like the idea of intermittent 
fasting, that will be my next experiment, once my body recovers from this food 
drought I put myself through.<br>
 Looking back I realize I did this a lot of 
IF when I was younger, some days not eating much if anything other days eating 
normally and enjoyed fantastic health. It wasn&rsquo;t until I began to worry 
about weight and what I was eating, how often each day etc that I begin to 
struggle to keep that level of health&ndash;interesting!</p> 
<p>I will let you know what I discover, I am going to try fasting 24 hrs. once 
a week for the next month (5pm til 5pm next day) and then once I feel steady 
after this prolonged fast I&rsquo;m currently on. I&rsquo;ll try it two times a 
week. Do you want me to keep you posted? This is incredibly interesting. 
I&rsquo;m still young and healthy so I think this should be fun.</p> Reply <br>

<p>I am very interesting in IFing. I have been following CAD. I have noticed 
that I am not hungry for the 2 LC meals, only the RM at dinner time. Dr. 
Rachael Heller only ate one meal per day before the book was written and that 
is how she lost over 100 lbs. Later when the Hellers&rsquo; wrote the 
Carbohydrates Addicts Diet book, they found that they could eat the LC meals 
too. The diet is based on the insulin released for the first 2 LC meals. 
Because of the small amount of insulin released on the 2 LC meals, insulin is 
released in a small amount at the Reward Meal (written now that it should be 
balanced but you are allowed carbs) within the first 60 minutes. I do have 2 
questions. If this is true, will only having the RM make me more insulin 
resistant? Should I have the same effect of low amounts of insulin release at 
the RM? or is it just less calories? My second question is I have a trainer 
that works me out now 3 times per week and I don&rsquo;t eat until everyday at 
8 pm, will no food give me less energy or hurt me at all in my workouts? Thank 
you very much for all the information that I have read so far. I really have no 
appetite during the day now and really enjoy regular amounts of food at dinner 
and have no cravings for junky food.</p> 
<p><em>I think it is untrue that if insulin is low during the day, the RM 
won&rsquo;t provoke a large insulin response. It has to. The body has to deal 
with the sugar contained in the meal. If it doesn&rsquo;t the hugely elevated 
blood sugar levels would be harmful and create enormous problems on their own. 
So, yes, the RM does provoke an insulin response large enough to deal with the 
carbs eaten. And a large insulin response can indeed worsen insulin resistance 
in one already afflicted with the problem.</em></p> <em> </em>

of a caloric deficit for weight loss and you get all the other benefits of 
fasting as well. Make sure you keep working, preserve your lean muscle and

<p>I don&rsquo;t think intermittent fasting should be used as an excuse to eat 
junk food. The SIRT1 gene is great, but why make it work so much harder by 
eating food that&rsquo;s bad for us? I wrote about this on my intermittent 
fasting blog at

<p>I have really enjoyed reading all these post.</p> 
<p>I would like to see some studies on how IF and a ketogenic diet (what I am 
doing) will work together. Like some here I have a problem with the whole IF 
and eat 200gms of carbs at a time, common sense says that it is WORSE, all the 
poison at one time. I would think one is asking for messed up metabolic profile.

<p>Keto Jim, I keep my diet truly ketogenic. I rarely eat more than 20 grams 
of carbs a day. Albeit there are some days when I consume more but it is rare. 
If you noticed any of my posts here, I also do a 20 hour fast with a 4 hour 
eating window. However, I sometimes eat only once a day. If you are doing a 
keto-type diet it is more important to eat more fats since that is where 
ketones come from and that is your energy source. My metabolism has responded 
quite well to the combination of low carbing and IF. To me, perhaps it is 
because I have done this for so long, but it is common sense that the 
metabolism would improve this way. Afterall, it has to work harder, therefore 
it gets stronger and it becomes more efficient at burning fat and calories. 
Just my way of thinking the whole picture. I had a check up and blood work in 
June and I did quite well. The only thing I find odd is my iron levels were low 
but my energy was high. Is it possible that my body doesn&rsquo;t need as much 
iron/oxygen? I am taking supplements until I visit my doctor again. But I 
wonder if they are really necessary. I look forward to your comments Dr. Eades

<p>I&rsquo;m really interested in the idea of intermittent fasting, and I was 
just wondering, is it okay to drink tea on the fasting days? I have a ginger 
lemon tea and a blueberry tea and I figured with the ginger lemon at the very 
least, it would help the detox process. It states that the tea is 0 calories as 
well, but I was just wondering if it could interfere with the fasting process 
at all. As a note it is also caffeine free, not sure if that makes a 
difference. Thanks so much for this interesting article and information! I 
think I might actually put my person results in the offtopic section of my

<p>It&rsquo;s really weird; I just started fasting (I&rsquo;m in my 2nd week) 
on Monday&rsquo;s, Wednesday, and Friday&rsquo;s. I had no idea that there were 
others who actually do this as a way of life until I started finding reasons 
why I shouldn&rsquo;t be doing this. I started doing this because for the last 
3.5 years I have been working out almost daily and haven&rsquo;t lost any 
weight. I would run 6 days per week, 3-5 miles and I typically work out 1.5 to 
2 hours on the days I work out and they&rsquo;re always tough workouts. I have 
always thought that working out as hard I have was actually causing me to keep 
my extra weight on. My problem is with food. I am a sugar addict. I love 
sweets, not starchy food like pasta, breads, potatoes; just homemade baked 
goods. If you take out the daily dose of sweets, I eat a very healthy diet, 
closer to a stone age type diet. So far I have to say that fasting 
intermittently seems to be working for me. I feel like I have much better 
mental clarity, I&rsquo;m not even thinking about baking cookies or eating ice 
cream, my appetite seems more controllable, my belly is flattening, and I have 
energy. I am not working out; I think I&rsquo;m going to concentrate on my 
eating habits and when I get to my desired weight, then I will exercise for 
maintenance.</p> 
<p>The only problem I am experiencing is I feel constantly dehydrated. Would 
that be related to fasting?</p> Reply <br>

<p>Hello,</p> 
<p>I am a female 5&rsquo;4 around 140 size 6. I carry my weight well I assume 
because I exercise regularly and eat fairly healthy. I would however like to 
lose about 10 lbs of fat. I have a long history with weight issues, mostly 
psychological. I think I am very near whatever my body thinks is its &lsquo;set 
weight&rdquo; because it is very difficult for me to lose weight. Except when I 
was starving myself, which I don&rsquo;t want ever to do again. But I&rsquo;m 
becoming very anxious about wanting to lose this weight. My question is, do you 
think intermittent fasting would benefit me if I am close to a healthy/goal 
weight? Or does it seem to work best with people with significant weight to 
lose?</p> 
<p>Also, for the past two months are so I&rsquo;ve been eating low carb, which 
I like as a lifestyle. I don&rsquo;t know if I have actually lost weight, no 
scale, but I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve gained weight. See for a while after 
I wasn&rsquo;t eating enough I was gaining weight when I began eating enough. 
This seemed to stop with low carb.</p>

<p>Hi Dr.</p> 
<p>My first post here  Just found your website. I read your first book many 
years ago (and wish that I had stuck with your recommendations back then.)</p> 
<p>Earlier this week, Monday, for the Yom Kippur holiday, I fasted. I thought 
about fasting in general, and about IF, and found this blog post while doing 
some research. I was sold. I did a 8pm to 8pm again on Weds and it went really 
well. Anyways, later on, as I continued my research, I found that you wrote a 
second post saying that the IF thing wasn&rsquo;t all that great after all and 
it seemed that your recommendation had changed. I read it on Tim 
Ferriss&rsquo;s blog, here:
http://www.fourhourworkweek.com/blog/2008/03/03/real-life-extension-caloric-restriction-or-intermittent-fasting-part-2/
 .</p> 
<p>Anyways, it would have been really nice to see part 2 of your post together 
with part one. I think it&rsquo;d be really nice if this post linked over to 
part 2, which does provide a significantly different view in regards to the 
subject matter.</p> 
<p>Thank&rsquo;s for all the work you do on your site, by the way.

 noon to 8 each day and fasting 16 
hours. I have heard things like 15-18 hours of fasting provides all the same 
benefits as alternate day. I&rsquo;ve also gotten a bunch of info from<br>
 
Robb Wolf and the Crossfit community. I&rsquo;m concerned with health and 
performance and am interested to know if anything has come up about 16 hours 
vs. 20 hours vs. 24 hours etc.</p> Reply <br>

<p>Hi Dr. Eades,</p> 
<p>I started the IF regime 4 weeks ago &ndash; I stop eating one day at 6pm 
and start eating again 24 hours later at 6pm throughout the week. I was prone 
before to getting low blood sugar swings &ndash; feeling light-headed, sweating 
and shaking &ndash; at certain times of the day &ndash; and suffering too with 
digestive problems. These have all disappeared. I do tend to over-eat at the 
end of each fast &ndash; the consequence of this is my belly feels like it has 
a brick inside it &ndash; but this soon passes. During the first 2 weeks I 
found it impossible on the fasting days to drink black coffee so I was cheating 
and drinking coffee with a small amount of milk. I have now started leaving out 
the milk and feel like I&rsquo;m achieving more. My stomach is now totally flat 
and my eating habits are more under control. I have learnt that most of my 
eating previously was based on eating whatever and whenever I liked, often to 
counter-act stress or just something to do. The amount of times I walked 
automatically towards the fridge door or the bread bin was quite scary. Now I 
have more self&rsquo;-control. On the mornings of my fast days I have boundless 
energy , especially when I do my exercises. Is it normal to &lsquo;go 
off&rsquo; alcohol ? I have developed a lack of taste for alcohol &ndash; 
it&rsquo;s like a physical aversion. And that&rsquo;s going from drinking a 
bottle of wine most nights. Is this common to go off alcohol ?</p> Reply <br>

<p>Hi doc,<br>
 Quick question on peri-workout nutrition. I generally train 
from 11am-12pm. 35 mins prior to lifting i take a preworkout supplement 
containing about 100 cals, almost all comming from carbs. Post workout i drink 
16 oz of chocolate milk. Would this peri-workout nutrition be permissable 
during the fast? As a side note I am not doing 24 hour fasts. I do 16/8. I 
generally fast from midnight until 4pm, with the exception of the epri-workout 
nutrition. Is this advisable or am I messing up the benefits of fasting? thank 
you<br>

<p>Dear Dr. Mike,</p> 
<p>I read your post with much interest. </p> 
<p>I would like to give the IF a go but am concerned about weight loss. 
I&rsquo;m 5&rsquo;9&Prime; and weigh around 143 lbs.. I have a very 
active-oriented job &ndash; on the move a lot &ndash; and I work out quite 
vigorously 4 times per week. My appetite is often voracious! What would you 
suggest?</p> 
<p>The other thing, I take a fair amount of fish oil (Carlson&rsquo;s Med 
Omega) on a daily basis along with pancreatic enzymes, curcumin, and green tea 
(in capsules). Given the calorie issue on fast days, I presume that it would be 
best to forego the fish oil on during fasting days.</p> 
<p>What would you suggest? Again, my primary hesitation is weight loss. One 
thought would be to fast every 3rd or 4th day.</p>

<p>addressing Bob&rsquo;s comments:</p> 
<p>I&rsquo;ve IF-ed since May 2003, doing a 24-hour fast that commences every 
other day routine for over five years. It&rsquo;s gone well and I maintain my 
weight without any problem. I have two exceptions to the no-calorie routine: a 
glass of red wine and the fish oil. I doubt that any benefits would vanish with 
these two &ldquo;indulgences&rdquo; &mdash; red wine contains resveratrol that 
activates sirtuin activity and fish oil omega 3s seem most important.</p> 
<p>I typically exercise vigorously one hour/day. I also eat often voraciously 
on eating days &ldquo;there is no spice like appetite&rdquo;</p> 
<p>I also take a resveratrol tablet (for about six months now)</p> 
<p>I&rsquo;m 71 now, have to watch my salt and take a diuretic for high blood 
pressure issues, have some mild osteoarthritis, but otherwise am very alert, 
energetic, and healthy.</p> 
<p>Of course we don&rsquo;t know what these personal experiments will have as 
outcomes, but I doubt much cancer. I sense that any IF is better than none and 
that the most one can tolerate is best. I like my present regime and the social 
connections so often a bar to IF are all accommodated in my family. I do have a 
policy of &ldquo;sociality trumps schedule&rdquo; so rarely I will eat at 23 or 
23 and a half hours if the situation would be best doing that.</p>

<p>I read this entry a couple of years ago in researching low carb diets and, 
though intrigued by the idea, didn&rsquo;t think I possessed the temperance to 
hang with it. That all changed this year when I participated in a 21 day juice 
fast with my wife. Beginning in early January, my wife and I ate no solid 
foods, but we did allow ourselves to have a few protein shakes every now and 
then, along with some pureed vegetable soups.</p> 
<p>Long story&ndash;short, I ended up losing 17 lbs, but that&rsquo;s not the 
best part. I have very stubborn hypertension. It&rsquo;s hereditary and started 
when I was 18 years old. Although I was 165 lbs and running 4 miles a day, my 
BP ran 160/112 at times. This has persisted throughout my life, and it only 
succumbs to quite strong medicine. My doctor has changed my meds a number of 
times trying to get it under control, especially now that I&rsquo;m 33 and 
overweight. Well, the fast did what my medicines have been unable to do.</p> 
<p>About a week and a half into the fast, my wife suggested that I check my 
BP. I told her that it was unlikely to be elevated, seeing that we hadn&rsquo;t 
been gorging ourselves. She wisely responded, &ldquo;Well, what if it&rsquo;s 
too low for you to be taking your medicine?&rdquo; That, folks, is called a 
Woman&rsquo;s intuition, the Hand of God, or whatever other form of divine 
intervention that you want to ascribe to it. My BP was at 90/65 with a pulse 
rate of 65. If I had taken my meds&hellip; No telling.</p> 
<p>Anyway, I kept checking my BP throughout the fast to make sure that it 
wasn&rsquo;t a fluke, and sure enough, it remained well below 120/80. With this 
new-found temperance&ndash;and encouraged by my terrific BP&ndash;I decided to 
break the fast by starting a regimen of IF, which led me back to this blog post.
</p> 
<p>I was curious as to whether my BP and HR would stay at my fasting levels 
after I started adding food back into the equation. Sure enough, a week into 
IF, my BP is averaging a very safe 110/75 and my HR barely gets above 72. I 
haven&rsquo;t taken BP meds in over three weeks now, and it&rsquo;s the best 
it&rsquo;s ever been. I plan to continue to monitor it closely, especially 
since I&rsquo;m off my meds, but in my limited experience, IF is a miracle. 
I&rsquo;m so thankful that I read Dr. Eades&rsquo;s post!</p> Reply <br>

<p>Hmm, I&rsquo;m not quite sure about this. I used to skip meals and by 
dinner I was ravenous and would pig out, then experience what I think was 
reactive hypoglycemia. I believe I experienced low blood sugar throughout the 
day as well and would CRAVE carbs to the point that I would binge and then 
purge. Yes, I developed an eating disorder, not to mention the fact I was 
constantly thinking about food. A doctor told me I needed to eat protein every 
3 hours. Moreover, I ultimately wasn&rsquo;t eating enough calories, which made 
my body think it was starving and shut down my t4 to t3 conversion. Following 
the doctor&rsquo;s advice worked and believe me, I was VERY hesitant to eat 
that much food! But it worked. All my food cravings disappeared along with my 
eating disorder and my unhealthy obsession with food. I am not sure IF can work 
for everyone. Any thoughts greatly appreciated!</p> Reply <br>

<p>There is a wrong way and a right way to do IF in my opinion. I would never 
fast if I had not had a hearty pre-fast meal, first. I enjoy eating alot of low 
carb/protein/ with added fats such as butter and coconut oil. I do indeed 
pig-out if I have the need.This kind of meal makes it easy for me to got 20-22 
hours in a fasted satate. I also consume fats during my fast by adding coconut 
oil or MCT oil to my coffee. Many people don&rsquo;t consider this as fasting 
but when you consider that fasting is ketogenic then I conclude that fats are a 
plus not a negative. My food is nutritious I rarely ever eat anything 
&ldquo;bad&rdquo; . No cakes, cookies, breads, potatoes. I have had blood work 
done and it is exemplary.</p>

<p>I do 24 hour fasts every other day x 5 years at least and do not experience 
ketosis (though I do drink a glass of wine and consume salmon oil capsules as 
my sole calories). I believe the liver has a 24 hour supply of potential 
glucose in the form of easily mobilized glycogen (that contrasts to muscle 
glycogen that&rsquo;s less easily mobilized). When in my early phases prior to 
a 24 hour fast commenced every other day, I fasted from dinner offset through 
the whole next day to breakfast on day 3. My wife then did notice ketone bodies 
on my breath (I did wine and oil capsules for omega 3s back then too). So I 
tend to believe (for me) that the liver has that 24 hour supply.</p> Reply <br>

<p>I have been reading a lot on the Internet about IF and decided to give it a 
try. I had just had blood work done so I know where I am starting from and will 
know if this is working for lowering cholesterol etc. I have been on this plan 
for a week doing 24 hour fast three days a week. I have lost 6 pounds so far. I 
have for years done low-carb only to end up causing a kidney stone (and not 
losing much weight at all), so cannot do that anymore. So I have switched to 
more veggies, fruit and low-fat proteins. I have high hopes for IF&hellip;my 
main reason for doing this is weight loss and to see if the health claims are 
for real!</p> Reply <br>

<p>Well, I have been just about a month and the bad news is that I 
haven&rsquo;t lost another pound. So, I am going off the IF and going to try 
and figure out just what I need to do. I have found that being Hypothyroid

<p>Thanks for the encouragement&hellip;I guess I get discouraged 
easily&hellip;I have tried so many things and over the years the weight keeps 
going up&hellip;I will give it another try&hellip;especially if it is good for 
my health. I know that fasting gives the body a chance to heal and 
&lsquo;clean&rsquo; itself so just that makes it worth it I guess. Thanks again!

<p>I am indeed healthier now than I was 3 years ago. It is easy to stick to 
eating healthy foods without cheating. I think that is because after developing 
the habit of eating within a scheduled window, you don&rsquo;t want to waste 
that time eating cookies and/or chips. I make healthier eating decisions. I am 
by-no-means an athlete but I walk everyday while I am fasting. Fasting enhances 
the success of excercise.</p> 
<p>Gloria, I had to work up to fasting. I didn&rsquo;t just wake up and said, 
&lsquo;I&rsquo;m going to start fasting&rdquo;. I began by eating breakfast and 
hour later each day. For example: If I eat breakfast one day at, 6:00 AM, after 
a few days, breakfast would be at 7:00 AM then 8:00 etc. I did this 
progressively until I was able to go until 3:00 PM before breaking my fast. 
That alone, took a month. Most importantly I feast when I break my fast. I 
enjoy large healthy meals without feeling the need to watch my portions. One 
thing I learned when I was considering using fasting was this isn&rsquo;t about 
reducing calories, it is about reducing meal frequencies. Fasting allows the 
gut to complete the job of digestion and gives it time to rest.</p> 
<p>What I liked about that was I could feel myself getting stronger physically 
and mentally.</p> Reply <br>

<p>Hi Dr. Eades,</p> 
<p>I haven&rsquo;t read this entire thread (it&rsquo;s very long!), but I see 
you&rsquo;re still responding to posts here so I thought I&rsquo;d ask my 
question:</p> 
<p>When you describe the eating pattern do you eat supper on the full eating 
days or are you eating breakfast lunch one day, and only dinner the next?</p> 
<p>I.e. is the pattern:<br>
 day one eat: breakfast lunch dinner<br>
 day two 
eat: dinner<br>
 with the last bite of food say 6:00pm day one and the next 
bite of food 6:00 pm day two (so a 24 hour period between bites)</p> 
<p>or is it:<br>
 day one eat: breakfast lunch<br>
 day two eat: dinner<br>
 
with the last bite being at lunch on day one and the next bite being dinner on 
day two (so around 28 hours between bites of food for the fasting period)</p> 
<p>Also, I&rsquo;ve read comments elsewhere (in the proteinpower.com forum) 
that you are not convinced there is any health benefit to the IF eating pattern 
&hellip; is that true? I&rsquo;m still interested in trying it just because it 
seems like, if tolerable, it would be a good way to reduce my overall caloric 
intake (there&rsquo;s a guy pushing a diet book based around that scheme).</p> 
<p>Thanks for any info you can provide.</p>

<p>Our regimen when we IF is the second of the two you described. We do it a 
little differently, however. We ate breakfast and usually a late lunch (circa 
3-4 PM) on day one, then didn&rsquo;t eat again until about 6 PM on day two.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been back and forth on the IF issue. The more data that comes in 
&ndash; especially human data &ndash; the more I&rsquo;m convinced it is a 
healthful way to live. Especially if what you want to eat is high-carb stuff. 
If you follow a good low-carb diet rigorously, you probably won&rsquo;t gain as 
much of an advantage with an IF as you would otherwise.</p> Reply <br>

<p>I was thinking this for an IF schedule with a lean towards low-carb 
dieting: what if you eat breakfast, then a late lunch/early dinner (at a time 
maybe in between you would eat the normal lunch and dinner), and then the next 
day either ate breakfast like normal or eat lunch at a more normal time?</p> 
<p>Example A<br>
 Day 1: Breakfast, late lunch/early dinner (same concept, 
just depends on how you&rsquo;d phrase it), sleep<br>
 Day 2: Breakfast, lunch, 
dinner, sleep (i.e., a normal day)</p> 
<p>Example B<br>
 Day 1: Breakfast, late lunch, sleep<br>
 Day 2: Normal-timed 
lunch, dinner, sleep<br>
 Day 3: Normal day</p> 
<p>Which example would you lean more towards doing as a low-card eater doing 
IF?</p>

<p>Sorry Mike, I made a comment about the Warrior Diet/IF parallel and how 
people weren&rsquo;t giving credit to Ori Hofmekler in a fair way, since IF is 
on the back essentially of the Warrior Diet putting the fasting/eating method 
into the more public mindset in the fitness/health community, but now see that 
this blog activity was way back in 2006&hellip;</p>

<p>FInally, I am four lbs away from my goal weight. I must say, however, that 
I had been stuck for the longest time at 148 lbs.I began losing again early 
January, after adding vitamin D 3 to my diet. I am now at 139 lbs and I 
continue to do low carb intermittent fasting. My dietary lifestyle has 
contributed to my healthy regimen and I intend to keep it way up.<br>

<p>Hi, my IF pattern is really flexible. I target for one meal a day and that 
works fine for me. Hence my fasting period is sometimes longer than 24 hours 
and sometimes shorter. On average, I do the 24-hour fasting three to four times 
a week. It&rsquo;s been my 5th year of IF.</p>

<p>Hello,</p> 
<p> I just got the results of recent blood work. My glucose level has gone up 
from 95 mg/dL in November last year to 103 on March 3rd 2010. It was 87 in 
2008. I&rsquo;m getting concerned given my diet, which may not be good enough 
after all.</p> 
<p>I do eat oatmeal frequently for breakfast (3 times per week) and eat a 
couple slices of Manna Bread from Julian Bakery a day. My whey powder has 
stevia in it. Other that those things, my diet consists of vegetables, a few 
blueberries, fish, and eggs. My Omega 3 to 6 ratio is excellent.</p> 
<p>Now, my fasting insulin level (through Quest Diagnostics) came back &lt; 2.
</p> 
<p>I am 56 years old and concerned that I may have early stage diabetes 1. </p>
<p>I was advised by a nutritional researcher against IF due to my weight. I'm 
5' 9&quot; and weigh about 142 pounds. I have resumed exercising regularly 
after a break of about a month due to family issues that needed addressing.</p> 
<p>Any insights would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>Both the oatmeal and the bread will drive blood sugars up. I&rsquo;m not 
sure if that&rsquo;s causing your problem or not because I don&rsquo;t have all 
the specifics of your situation. I don&rsquo;t think your body size precludes 
you from following an IF as long as you consume plenty of good quality calories 
during the time you do eat.</p> Reply <br>

<p>Hi Mike. </p> 
<p>This is so interesting to me. I&rsquo;m about 5&rsquo;7&Prime; and 135 
pounds. I am certainly not claiming to be obese at all but would love to get a 
little leaner. I&rsquo;m wondering if this is my answer? I work out daily 
(running 4 miles on cardio days and weights every other day) but haven&rsquo;t 
been able to drop about the 8 pounds I&rsquo;d like to. I&rsquo;ve been told 
I&rsquo;m not eating enough but then my husband told me one of his friends who 
is a trainer does IF and swears by it. This is the best trail of posts 
I&rsquo;ve found so I&rsquo;m very interested to try this out. I&rsquo;m in 
great health (I have mandatory blood work done every year for my insurance 
coverage) so I&rsquo;m not concerned with it being detrimental to my body.</p> 
<p>My question is&hellip;I assume this needs to be a lifestyle change. Is it 
possible to reprogram myself permanently?</p> Reply <br>

<p>Bob, I am pre-diabetic. One thing that I have learned is that IFers tend to 
have higher FBG levels but their levesl throughout the day tend to be quite 
normal. I avoid foods that are high in carbohydrates namely oratmeal and bread. 
my doctor&rsquo;s advise is to watch my carbs. He is aware that I fast on a 
daily basis.</p> 
<p>Also, I began taking some good vitamin D supplements and I was surprised at 
how much my glucose levels went down.<br>
 They continue to slip into the 
normal range. I monitor my blood glucose on a daily basis. I don&rsquo;t waste 
time eating poor quality food. I always , always eat healthy low carb meals. I 
also walk for 40 minutes to an hour daily.</p> 
<p>I hope this is helpful.</p> Reply <br>

<p>I experimented with IM about a year ago as a way to lose weight. I was able 
to lose about 2 lbs a week by fasting 3 times/week. Each fast was pretty much 
as you described &ndash; about 23 hours between meals. I started a new regime 
earlier this week, one that is much more restrictive. I don&rsquo;t eat Monday, 
Wednesday or Friday. I never eat breakfast, never have. So my fasts are about 
40 hrs in length. I have lost about 7 lbs this week. I feel great. I 
don&rsquo;t feel especially hungry during the fast and my energy levels are 
fine. I plan to lose almost 50 lbs this way. I have no portion control&hellip; 
I find that it is much easier for me to either eat or not eat. Controlling how 
much I eat is difficult. Once my weight is down, I&rsquo;ll switch to one day 
of fasting per week.</p> Reply <br>

<p>Hi!<br>
 Almost every other website says that our body goes into 
&ldquo;starvation mode&rdquo; if we eat only once a day. If I eat only one meal 
a day (so fasting for about 20 hrs), would my metabolism slow down? There is so 
much contradictory information everywhere that I don&rsquo;t know what to do!
</p> 
<p>Also, I live in South Korea where every meal is with white rice or 
noodles&hellip;.would I still be able to reap the benefits and lose weight even 
with eating carbs all the time?</p> Reply <br>

<ul> 
<li> Johnny Wolf, August 26, 2010 at 11:13 am <br>
<br>

<p>1. No, your metabolism won&rsquo;t slow down.<br>
 2. It doesn&rsquo;t 
matter that much what you eat when you are fasting and rice isn&rsquo;t the 
worst of carbs. Noodles I would avoid though.<br>
 3. You need to keep overall 
calorie restriction to lose weight, regardless of how you eat. It&rsquo;s 
easier to do this when you fast, but just keep that in mind.</p> Reply <br>

<p>Hi,<br>
 I haven&rsquo;t read the entire thread but thought I&rsquo;d add 
my comments and read later. I have been engaged in various forms of IF for 31 
years ranging form long fasts to fasting one day a week. I started when I was 
about 19 and I am now 50. In the late 70&prime;s and early 80&prime;s my 
husband and I did some radical fasting- 30 days on juices. Neither of us were 
the least bit overweight, we did it to cleanse.<br>
 At this point I am pretty 
much known for my impeccable health and youthful appearance and demeanor. I 
feel great and almost never tire. No gray hair. No wrinkles. No medications. 
I&rsquo;m at a healthy weight after having 5 kids. People say to me &rdquo; I 
knew a lady 20 years ago that sold baskets and flowers, was that your mother? 
Can&rsquo;t be you because you look the same.&rdquo;<br>
 Yes I have a healthy 
lifestyle and good genes. I live in the country, have a peaceful happy life and 
my gardens overflow with unlimited organic produce 10 months a year. I&rsquo;ve 
been a vegetarian for 30 years. But I have wonder if fasting intermittently for 
3 decades is a factor in my good health.</p> Reply <br>

<p>Dear Dr Eades,<br>
 About 5 years ago I lost 70 lbs. by eating one small 
meal a day. I had an extreme amount of weight to lose. in 2005 I had 2 mini 
strokes that were attributed to Atrial Fibrillation. I have been cardio verted 
twice,the heart meds no longer keep me in rythem, so my heartbeat remains 
irregular. I have had a cardiac catherization with no results as to what is 
causing my A Fib. BTW I also regained the weight plus 10 additional LBS.<br>
 
What are your thoughts regarding IF in relation to A Fib ?<br>
 I have been 
eating one meal a day for the past week and I feel great. Hungry in the AM but 
with a glass of water it disappears, I have my meal between noon and 2 
o&rsquo;clock and it is LC &hellip;no grains. I have more energy,and my joint 
pains have disappeared. I also fill up fast when I eat and have lost my craving 
for sugar. I have a considerable amt. of wt. to lose &gt;125 lbs. Have dropped 
4 lbs. this past week which makes me feel I am going in the right direction.</p>

 I love the idea of the IF program, although i don&rsquo;t 
really suffer from to many health problems my biggest concern is my weight, i 
weigh about 215lb I have been this heavy for years and have been tring so many 
things but i still feld. If the IF program can help me loose some weight I will

<p>Hi,</p> 
<p> I&rsquo;m trying intermittent fasting because I feel so frustrated with my 
weight right now. I gained about 100 lbs. in less than a year in 2008-2009 due 
to a terrible combo of psychiatric drugs which gave me a thyroid problem and 
really exacerbated the horrible varicose veins in my legs. As soon as I began 
weaning off those drugs, I got so much better mentally and got a second opinion 
and counseling. Great, I&rsquo;d wasted 2 years seeing a psychiatrist for a 
condition I didn&rsquo;t even have.</p> 
<p>Well, I was feeling great mentally, but was a physical wreck. I was able to 
stop the weight gain, but after a year of having 1 bowl of mini wheats for 
breakfast and lunch and watching my dinners and cutting back almost entirely on 
baking (which I love), my weight just sat there and then I even gained 10 lbs 
after 2 car trips that really made my leg swell up. I can&rsquo;t even get my 
doctor to call me back to talk about IF, but I&rsquo;m doing it.</p> Reply <br>

<p>I have been doing intermittent fasting for 2 years straight the way Brad 
Pilon recommends in the book &ldquo;Eat Stop Eat&rdquo;.</p> 
<p>Here is a quick outline:</p> 
<p>* eat normal 5 days per week<br>
 * fast 2 times per week until dinner<br>
 
* for that dinner meal, eat a normal size dinner (not a day&rsquo;s worth of 
calories)</p> 
<p>What I have found is that this is a way to reduce your weekly total 
calories and can create a nice weekly calorie deficit.</p> 
<p>There are other nice advantages as fasting has shown to boost HGH, but to 
me the whole calorie deficit created is what really makes the difference.</p> 
<p>It is simply a great way to eat less, without feeling like you are dieting 
hard most of the time. Once you get used to fasting it is really easy as well.

<p>Hi there,</p> 
<p>Thanks for the excellent read. I have been most interested in the subject 
and tried it off and on for a few days over the past 6 months. I finally 
realized it is a system that must be implemented whole-heartedly in order to 
maximize results and benefits. Thus I started the 24 hour on, 24 hour off, 
program last week. Lost 7.5 lbs in one week, I understand that much of that is 
water loss, understanding that the caloric restrictions that would imply. 
However, I adhere to teh 24 hour fast, combining that with a full 1 hour 
workout every morning that incorporates heavy lifting and high interval cardio 
within the rest periods of my excercise. This maximizes my workout efficiency. 
I have not seemed to lose any musce-mass, but have managed to lose inches. I 
hope to lose some 40 lbs to get to 200 lbs. I am a 43 year old male, quite 
muscular. I have noted a reduced appetite and am working on lowering my blood 
pressure. I&rsquo;ve implemented a supplementation program to minimize 
inflamation including axtazanthin, garlic caps, fish oil, multivitamin and a 
morning shake on my eating mornings composed of almond milk, flax seed, frozen 
berries, protein whey.</p> 
<p>I wonder, have you had a chance to post or read any further breakthrough 
research on the subject of IF. I scan the net regularly, but have not found 
anything relatively new on the subject. Also, at which point in the fast would 
a body go into ketosis, readings vary, I believe my utilization of a high 
interval training session in mornings would aid me on fast days to use up my 
glycogen stores more quickly.</p> 
<p>Thank you for your post and your time &ndash; I shall keep you updated.</p>

<p>thanks for a great read. I have tried IF for the last 4 or so months, 
moslty grazing on fruit (a couple of apples and bananas, almonds) through the 
day and then eating a couple of big meals at nite. Based around what I first 
read about the warrior diet.</p> 
<p>My questions is this, do all the people on here who IF this way still eat 
small amounts of food during the day? I really find it hard to go all day with 
out eating a single thing (still drink water obviously). I know it is possible 
but man I get really hungry!!</p> 
<p>Also I&rsquo;m just beggining to do strength training 4 mornings a week 
after nearly a years break, so I like to have a couple of eggs straight after 
for breakfast. I&rsquo;ve always been told to eat good protein immediatly after 
training. Would it be wise to lift heavey and then fast the rest of the day and 
then eat a few large meals at night?</p>

<p>The world&rsquo;s oldest man, 114-year-old Breuning may have accidentally 
practiced intermittent fasting for the last 35 years. He eats breakfast and 
lunch but no dinner. That leaves ~19 hours of intermittent fasting, not that 
different from 24 hours of intermittent fasting in the research papers. Also 
his comment that he felt much better right away after starting this habit is 
telling. One might have assumed that he would have felt worse right away until 
he got used to missing dinner.</p> 
<p>A great advantage of intermittent fasting is that it is eminently doable 
for the average person as evidenced by Breuning himself. All you have to do is 
skip dinner. And that would be a time saver too.</p> 
<p>http://www.greatfallstribune.com/article/20100919/NEWS01/9190301</p> 
<p>&ldquo;As it turns out, longevity runs in much of Breuning&rsquo;s<br>
 
family, although his parents died at ages 50 and 46.<br>
 His paternal 
grandparents lived into their 90s, and<br>
 three siblings lived to ages 85, 91 
and 100. Another<br>
 brother died at age 78.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>(therefore, siblings averaged just 88 years&ndash;he is now 26 years older 
than this&ndash; and his parents averaged only 48 years; no information on his 
maternal grandparents but assume they died at 78; summing all of his first 
degree relatives up with proper weighting factors, Breuning should have lived 
to age 76)</p> 
<p>Did he reveal his &ldquo;secrets&rdquo; last year at 113?</p> 
<p>1) &ldquo;I think you should push back from the table when you&rsquo;re 
still hungry&rdquo; (Famously long-lived Okinawans do the same thing, Hara 
Bachi Bu&ndash; eat until you are 80% full:
http://www.okinawa-diet.com/okinawa_diet/hara_hachi_bu.html )</p> 
<p>2) &ldquo;Every day I exercise. Every morning I do all my exercises.&rdquo; 
</p> 
<p>3) For the last 35 years, he has eaten just two meals per day, breakfast 
and lunch; he skips dinner and &ldquo;feels much better for it.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>4) No medications; a baby aspirin per day is the only pill he takes, </p> 
<p>5) drinks lots of water, eats lots of fruits &amp; vegetables and has 2 1/2 
cups of coffee per day. His breakfast is eggs, toast or pancakes.</p> 
<p>Looks pretty good for 113 and he is still completely lucid (see birthday 
speech URL embedded in article).</p>

<p>Hi there!<br>
 I really enjoyed reading this and I&rsquo;m definatly going 
to try this out! I don&rsquo;t normally eat much in a day if anything, so it 
isn&rsquo;t going to be very difficult to change my eating habits &ndash; but I 
do have a question.<br>
 On the fasting 24 hours can you not have any food at 
all? For example would the process still work if I ate some celery which 
doesn&rsquo;t contain any calories? Celery is my snack of choice if I&rsquo;m 
starving hungry on the go and I&rsquo;d like to know if it&rsquo;s off limits 
during fasts.<br>
 Thankyou very much!</p> Reply <br>

<p>I started IF without knowing what it was. I had to fast two days for a 
colonoscopy. Turned out to be easy the first day so I started fasting two days 
a week with the fast days lasting 32 hours. They are separated by one eating 
day. Then I get to eat 4 days before doing it again.</p> 
<p>After 11 weeks I am down 15 pounds but more importantly my blood pressure 
is down from 140/80 to 115/68! I can&rsquo;t wait to get a physical next 
February to see what my other numbers are like.</p> 
<p>I like this way of eating so much that I don&rsquo;t see ever changing. I 
get a little hungry and have had a 100-200 calorie snack a couple of times but 
generally It goes well and I know I can eat what I want in only a few hours in 
most cases.</p> 
<p>If there were ever a holy grail to getting fit and healthy this is it. I 
get lite exercise but will start walking a couple of evenings each week to 
juice things up a bit.</p> 
<p>Everything else you read is right on. More energy on fasting day. Sometimes 
I am amazed by it. Easy to control yourself, no tracking meals and calories. 
Just a great experience.</p> Reply <br>

<p>I started low carbing three years ago, because I was desperate for help 
with chronic headaches and migraines. It has helped a lot, but has not 
eliminated the migraines. One thing I have figured out in the last year, is 
that is my head doesn&rsquo;t feel too good, if I just STOP EATING until it 
feels better (this usually means skipping one or two meals) I can avoid taking 
a triptan. In the old carb days I would never have been able to do that because 
a drop in blood sugar was a major headache trigger.</p> 
<p>I would love to try a longer fast, to see if it might &ldquo;cure&rdquo; 
something in my head, but I&rsquo;ve never been overweight, and I&rsquo;m 
afraid I might lose too much weight.</p> Reply <br>

<p>I have been doing intermittent fasting for several years now. You 
don&rsquo;t really &ldquo;drop&rdquo; pounds on IF. As a matter of fact I 
recently put on a few pounds.</p> 
<p>My migraines stopped after doing LC but the auras remained. owever once I 
began doing IF, my auras also vanished. I discovered that I had a magnesium 
deficiency which contributed to regular run of the mill headaches. Actually I 
began taking magnesium instead of otc meds for my headaches which worked just 
as well. Later I realized that low manesium also contributed to my pre-diabetes 
so I began taking magnesium regularly and I have experienced healthier blood 
glucose levels.</p> 
<p>So, Kate, I would add magnesium along with IF.</p> Reply <br>

<p>I am a 26 year old mother of a 20 month old, and I hadn&rsquo;t lost the 
extra weight I gained from having my son. So, I decided to try the intermittent 
fasting. For 5 days now, I have been drinking only water until 6 p.m. every 
day. At 6 p.m. I usually have a dinner consisting of a baked chicken breast 
with mixed greens &amp; carrots. I find that the meal is more delicious than 
the junk I used to eat and it fills me up completely. The first couple of days 
were very difficult, but now it just seems normal. My skin has cleared up and I 
have already lost 8 lbs! I feel clear headed and surprisingly energized. I 
fully recommend this diet to anyone who needs to slim down and just feel 
healthier!</p> Reply <br>

<p>Hi&hellip; I started IF today. It was such a difficult day, but then at 8pm 
I came across your post with its different IF schedule and I hurrayed and 
hurried off to the kitchen to fix myself a pizza. I will stop eating at 6pm

<p>I do have a question: I am curious about insulin-dependent diabetics. Do 
you think they&rsquo;d be able to adjust their insulin regimen to fit around 
IF? If they don&rsquo;t snack with every insulin shot they&rsquo;ll get 
hypoglycaemia&hellip; so can they go completely without insulin (or lower dose) 
on fasting days?</p> Reply <br>

diligence.</p> Reply <br>

<p>I am 58 years old and think I have finally found a plan that I can live 
with. I have been successful with other diets but have always fallen off the 
wagon and gained it back. I work out with weights, and do moderate cardio, but 
now need to lose about 60 lbs. I think I can do it with IF. I started several 
days ago and it has been a breeze. I am doing 19 hours fasting and eating in a 
5 hour window. I do not think I am overeating in the window so far and I am 
going to try to do as much low carb as possible. I do like carbs though, but I 
so far notice I fill up rather quickly when I end the fast.<br>
 I will keep 
you posted, but so far I think it is going well. I am so far doing the IF 
daily, but may relax some on the weekends (to do family stuff if you know what 
I mean). Any tips or help is greatly appreciated. Thanks.</p> Reply <br>

<p>I am an insulin dependent diabetic and do the IF from time to time. It is 
just a matter of dosing your insulin to match your liver output. If you are 
using a slow acting insulin like Humulin N or other 12 to 24 hour product, you 
can just use this during the fasting periods. Save the quick acting for your 
meals. It is not difficult to manage.</p> Reply <br>

<p>Would this work for a compulsive overeater? Assuming I can control myself 
enough to fast for the required 24 hours, would all of the work be undone if I 
were to consume something like 4,000 calories in the 24 hours i was able to eat?

<p>It would work much better than consuming the 4000 kcal every day. The 
beauty of the program is that you can chow down to your heart&rsquo;s content 
on the eating days as long you don&rsquo;t eat on the fast day.</p> Reply <br>

<p>does eating a huge amount of calories (overeating) in one sitting spike 
insulin levels? also, isn&rsquo;t is hard on the body and digestive system? 
i&rsquo;ve been reading a lot about IF lately and there are 2 methods that many 
people seem to be using &ndash; Eat Stop Eat by brad pilon and the warrior diet 
by ori hofmekler. ori eats like his whole day&rsquo;s worth of calories pretty

<p>That&rsquo;s what I really love about IF. I eat without worrying about over 
eating. I keep my menus low carb&hellip;very low carb and eat to my 
heart&rsquo;s content. I have never gotten to that &ldquo;I&rsquo;m gonna 
burst&rdquo; feeling eaither. Once I begin to feel satiated, I stop eating 
because I don&rsquo;t want any more food. There are days when I feel like I am 
just &ldquo;starving&rdquo; and I am full after a few bites. So some days I eat 
more than on others. ALso, when I began doing IF I began by eating breakfast 
progressively later each day. Eventually I was able to go until 3:00 PM before 
breaking my fast.</p> Reply <br>

<p>I just started your program suggested in the blog for IF this past thursday 
since because of living overseas right now and not having my own way to control 
my whole meal plan at the moment. It has been going very well and I am already 
down 2 kilos and have been able exercise just fine while fasting. I am excited 
because I have a lot of weight to lose and I can&rsquo;t seem to stick to any 
other diet at the moment either. I have a primary health concern that I wanted 
to ask about. I really want to have more children but my FSH has gone up to 15 
this year. I want to know if IF and or low carb can help me to improve FSH 
levels and or fertility-many have suggested lowfat vegan diets for this but I 
can&rsquo;t stick to it and my depression and irritability go way up on that 
diet. Any info would be greatly appreciated as I have already failed IVF and am 
out of ways to help myself as acupuncture, wheatgrass or Chinese herbs are not 
available here.</p> Reply <br>

<p>Don&rsquo;t know if low-carbing or IF will help your particular situation, 
but I can&rsquo;t tell you how many patients I&rsquo;ve lost to pregnancy. 
These are women who had become infertile because of their obesity and 
weren&rsquo;t practicing birth control as a consequence. They started the 
low-carb diet and got pregnant within a couple of months. I never checked FSH 
levels on these ladies, so I don&rsquo;t know what the levels did on the diet.

<p>I have been looking into fasting for some time now for both health and 
religious benefits. I have done a fair number of 1 day, 3 day and one 9 day 
fast. I hope to do a 40 day fast someday.</p> 
<p>The one thing about the 3 day fasts is how much better your digestion feels 
after getting &lsquo;cleared out&rsquo;. I am going to start IF but to begin 
with I will do twice a week (Tuesday/Friday) going from 6PM-6PM. I&rsquo;ll be

<p>I began doing IF three weeks ago by fasting for two 40 hour fasts on 
Tuesdays and Fridays. I would stop eating around 6pm the prior evening and not 
eat again until Wednesday a.m. and Saturday a.m. I did this 3 times and was 
beginning to make a little progress, noticing that my clothes were a bit looser 
and my skin looked better when I stumbled across this website and read about 
the 6pm to 6pm (24 hr. fast) so I decided (against my better judgment) to try 
it by doing 2 fast per week at 6pm to 6pm even though in my younger days, I 
could go all day without eating and then eat a large meal at night and GAIN 
weight, but as long as I did all my eating by 1:00 pm, I lost. That was back 
when I was young and still had my girlish figure and metabolism. I&rsquo;m 46 
now and struggling to get my figure back. I&rsquo;m about 30-40 lbs overweight 
at 5&rsquo;8&Prime;. Anyway, I found that doing the 6pm to 6pm 24 hr fast 
caused me to obsess and plan all day long about the meal I would get to eat at 
6pm and when the time finally arrived, I was STARVING like a ravenous dog!! I 
know it&rsquo;s probably mostly psychological, but nonetheless, it is Friday 
and I&rsquo;m doing my 40 hour fast again after having done two 6pm to 6pm 
fasts and have gained back whatever I lost and then some judging by the way my 
clothes are fitting today. It is so discouraging because I love to eat but I 
hate being overweight. Life is truly not fair in this aspect since when I was 
younger, up to my 30&prime;s, I could pretty much eat whatever I wanted, and if 
I put on a few pounds, I&rsquo;d go to Walmart and get some Metabolife 356 with 
ephedra and drop the weight in no time. Since the corrupt Fatal Drugs Allowed 
(FDA) took that off the market while leaving hundreds of dangerous, side 
effect, death causing pharmaceuticals), I haven&rsquo;t been able to keep the 
weight off. Anyway, just wanted to get this off my chest. I&rsquo;m feeling 
down and discouraged today and am starting over on my Tuesday and Friday 40 
hour fasts, hoping to see progress again. It&rsquo;s easier for me just to put 
food out of my mind and go all day long until the next day than to try an 
&ldquo;eating window&rdquo; during the day because I will eat like a 7 foot 
tall lumberjack during the &ldquo;window&rdquo;. At least my skin looks better 
but I don&rsquo;t know it&rsquo;s the fasting or the Resveretrol supplements 
I&rsquo;ve been taking for the past month starting to kick in. I&rsquo;ll come 
back in a couple of weeks and let you know if the 40 hour fasts twice per week 
are working.</p> Reply <br>

<p>This sounds great. I see lots of meat eating going on in this low-carb 
IFing. Would it be a reasonable plan for someone who does not eat meat but 
wants to still go low carb? Seems like the meat protein is what is allowing you 
to feel full for long periods of time. Could you-or some non-eat meaters doing 
IF- recommend non-meat proteins that work similarly. Also, I see lots of people 
taking supplements while IFing. As a 37 year old female carrying 30-40 extra 
pounds who has never taken supplements (though Dr. said I could definitely use 
an Iron supplement) can you recommend supplements I may want to be taking while 
following a non-meat, low-carb IF lifestyle.</p> Reply <br>

<p>I&rsquo;ve learned for a term &lsquo;intermittent fast&rsquo; an hour ago. 
However, this is exactly how I lost 100 pounds about two years ago.</p> 
<p>My story is typical. I&rsquo;ve started dieting 15 years ago, at first to 
lose 5 pounds and gradually, through those years, 5 pounds turned to 100. In 
summer 2008 I discovered fasting. For me fasting was first &lsquo;diet&rsquo; 
ever, that worked more than 3 days in a row. I fasted 20 days without any 
problems. However, when one has 100 pounds to loose, fasting is not an option. 
Once you finish 20-30 days fast you find yourself on the uncharted territory 
again and through re-feeding time, regardless how carefully you eat, pounds 
mercilessly come back as fast as they were off. At least, that was my 
experience.</p> 
<p>So, I &lsquo;invented&rsquo; my system. I was eating once every third 
night, usually, a dinner around 7 pm. On the several occasions, I broke that 
3-day &lsquo;chain&rsquo;, primarily due to social events but the point is that 
I lost all my weight in 4 1/2 months.</p> 
<p>Now I have to admit, I&rsquo;m and always have been vegetarian, or 
better&ndash;quasi vegetarian, i.e. I do not eat white or red meat but I eat 
seafood. So my dinners were based on &lsquo;eat what you want&rsquo; concept 
except for meat and sugar. Usually, that meant some fish, salads, veggie 
sprouts, beans, occasionally eggs, a lot of fruits. In the beginning those 
meals looked like binging feasts but as my stomach became smaller my meals 
became smaller too. It happened very effortlessly and naturally.</p> 
<p>Now, two years later I&rsquo;m still 125, 5&rsquo;7&Prime; tall, 45 years 
old and very happy the way I look. I eat everything except meat, sugar and high 
carbs, but only once a day, in the late afternoon or evening.</p> 
<p>I really thought that I&rsquo;m alone. Two years ago, fasting experts on 
the several internet sites and my naturopath-physician, scolded my &lsquo;diet 
plan&rsquo; and warned me about all that protein that I will lose, over and 
over again. Short, repetitive fasts, they said are extremely dangerous, I may 
lose all my muscle and I will not get any fasting benefits. I can&rsquo;t say 
that I was not concerned but I&rsquo;m glad I didn&rsquo;t listen.</p> 
<p>During those 4 months I never measured my ketons but occasional hunger 
attacks were so short and mild that I strongly believe my &lsquo;diet&rsquo; 
was heavily keton-supported. Obviously, once they are produced, they 
don&rsquo;t just disappear overnight.</p> 
<p>I don&rsquo;t know whether I lost any muscle as I was told, but after an 
hour in gym everything hurts &hellip; So I guess, some muscle is still there. 
And I can swim and run faster than when I was 20.</p> 
<p>I&rsquo;m glad that I am (finally) able to share my story and that 3-day 
fasting program is not as ridiculous as I was once told it is. And I hope that 
someone else, may find out that as well.</p> 
<p>Congrats on excellent blog!</p>

<p>I did IF for more than 2 years and I stopped for reasons I&rsquo;ll explain 
below.</p> 
<p>I only ate every other day. The first few days weren&rsquo;t easy but I 
soon got very comfortable doing it.</p> 
<p>The first few months that worked really well and I got to a very low 
bodyfat level without changing my diet. After a while my body learned to 
compensate and I got to my normal weight again. I ate _a lot_ of carbs on the 
days that I did eat. I didn&rsquo;t know about low carb diets at the time, 
basically I considered IF an easy way to stay healthy while still being able to 
eat yummy cookies and whatever else I wanted.</p> 
<p>After a few months it became hard to keep doing this from a social 
standpoint, since the days I ate flipped every week and having social dinner on 
the right day was difficult.</p> 
<p>The days that I fasted I never felt the energy boost that is reported for 
fasting, and I often felt very cold. I assume my body compensated for the lack 
of available fuel.</p> 
<p>After two years of this I started to develop what I now recognize as 
insulin resistance &ndash; probably due to my very high carb intake on the days 
I did eat.</p> 
<p>Eventually I stopped doing IF. It didn&rsquo;t improve the way I felt of 
course, since I didn&rsquo;t change my diet. Luckily I now feel great on a 
paleo 2.0 diet &ndash; so far </p> 
<p>In conclusion I can say that fasting every other day is quite easy mentally 
and physiologically, but social factors make it hard, and if you eat low carb I 
don&rsquo;t really see the point of doing IF very much. I get the same low

<p>Dr. Eades, have been on a VLCD since Nov last year, lost 65 lbs, but still 
having headaches I know to be from blood sugar. I have Insulin Resistance. I 
saw your post about Salt, and Potassium, and Copper, but these haven&rsquo;t 
seemed to help. Any thoughts/suggestions? Can&rsquo;t think well at work with 
them and I know that I am all out of whack, and trying to reverse this thing. 
Thanks!</p> Reply <br>

<p>It is really nice to read some positive words about intermittent fasting. 
It is truly the only method I ever tried that resulted in significant weight 
loss and lasting weight control. I practiced it for several years quite some 
time ago with spectacular results. As I began to build muscle from my daily 
workouts I slowly regained some weight but it was muscle and my clothes still 
fit. Then I started listening to old &ldquo;parent tapes&rdquo; in my head 
about &ldquo;starving myself&rdquo; when in fact intermittent fasting is 
voluntary and starvation is not. I forgot that &ldquo;breakfast is the most 
important meal of the day&rdquo; only for General Mills (sorry, any GM folks in 
the room). All I did was gain weight. Well, I&rsquo;m getting on in years now 
and have had a few health problems. Now that I&rsquo;m minus my gallbladder I 
decided to try intermittent fasting again. I fast three 24-periods per week, 
6PM Sunday to 6PM Monday; 6PM Tuesday to 6PM Wedesday; and, 6PM Thursday to 6PM 
Friday. I don&rsquo;t eat on any particular schedule at all over the week-ends, 
as eating by the clock is what got me in this fix in the first place. I have 
lost 10 pounds since 11 April. I expect the weight loss to slow down eventually 
but I&rsquo;m certainly not going to fret about it. I always hated counting 
calories and now I don&rsquo;t do that anymore. Like many others who have 
posted comments, I find that on the fasting days I am curiously energetic and 
of a buoyant mood. For me, intermittent fasting just feels better. Good luck, 
everybody. How about let&rsquo;s stick it to the &ldquo;diet industry.&rdquo;

<p>Since December 28th I have fasted twice a week (Tuesday/Friday &ndash; and 
changing it to Monday/Thursday a month ago for 24 hours. 6PM/6PM is my goal but 
I just run a timer from my last meal). I have missed three days in all that 
time. I have to say I love doing it. It has totally changed my view on food and 
my weight is steady. (I do not keep losing weight) For me it has never been 
about losing weight but clearing out the digestive tract and having discipline. 
I will say, right off, there is never a good day to fast because there are 
always good meals to be eaten but with the Eat Stop Eat you never go a full day 
without eating. I highly recommend it.</p> Reply <br>

<p>I tried this for a couple days, for a trial run last week&hellip; I 
experienced lack of a real hunger, interestingly. I typically work out from 
10:30-midnight, after which I&rsquo;ll go have a protein shake before bed. 
I&rsquo;ll fast from then until about 5:00 the next day, and I&rsquo;ll eat 
eggs, ground beef or ground italian sausage, and salad. I might have a protein 
shake around 7:30, then my postworkout shake. Anything here that you would

<p>Blood glucose went from 102 (last years reading) to 95.</p> 
<p>Cholesterol went from 238 (last yr) to 194.<br>
 LDL went from 168 to 135

<p>I was intrigued, so I began IF on April 30, and have been successfully 
fasting every other 24 hour period since. I feel good, even better on the 
fasting days, but I haven&rsquo;t had the blood work done to show changes. I 
think a natural result of intermittent fasting is caloric reduction (who wants 
to suffer through a day of no food and then blow it with a lot of garbage?), 
and I have as a result lost about 6 pounds. I plan to continue into the fall, 
and see how it&rsquo;s going in another 3 months&hellip;</p> Reply <br>

<p>Very interesting read, I&rsquo;ve recently tested positive for HLA-B27 
which is a blood marker for Ankylosing Spondylitis, I&rsquo;ve suffered 
lower/upper back pain not to mention hip pain for the past 18yrs,(i&rsquo;m 40 
now), now since i&rsquo;m a muslim part of my faith is fast for 30days once a 
year, from dawn till dusk(you eat NOTHING at all, not even a drink of water,not 
even chewing gum). Fasting happens various times of the year and this year 
(2011) it will happen around Aug 1st till 31st. So as you can see the fasting 
month has been occuring when the days are long. What I realised my pains in my 
back and not to mention my fatigue had gone. I thought it was something to do 
with what i was eating and most evidence points to starch as being bad for AS 
suffers. So i can only conclude my conditon improved cause i was starving my 
body of starch.<br>
 When i&rsquo;ve fasted when the days were shorter, eg in 
winter months, i didnt notice any pain relief ,non whatsoever, i believe 
because i was not starving my body long enough. My point being i guess fasting 
does have some real health benefits when doing it for a long period of time say 
16-17hrs a day.</p> Reply <br>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been fasting 3 days a week for almost a year, and two days a 
week a year before that. I decided on three days as that puts me at about 40% 
reduction of cals. I combine Monday and Tuesday into one fast, eat lightly on 
Wednesday, and fast again thursday. I know I&rsquo;ve lost some wt. but not 
lots~~still kinda chubby&mdash;BUT I DO FEEL GREAT! have not had blood tests or 
any such thing, so I have no idea how much my overall health has been effected. 
I do know, I look forward to my Monday/Tuesday fast, I feel there is a detox 
component to 60 hour weekly fast&mdash; I mega dose on vitamin C during the 
detox (about 15 grams powdered) for a powerful &ldquo;evacuation&rdquo; on all 
days. I can&rsquo;t begin to tell you how good I feel on Tues and Wednesday 
morning (I honestly don&rsquo;t want to ruin the feeling with food&mdash; but 
ya gotta eat&hellip;)My thursday fast is just a prelude to the inevitable 
Friday night out, and having people over on Saturday and all the drinking that 
goes with that. Sunday, I usually wish I had fasted Friday and Saturday, but I 
know Monday is coming&mdash; my great day of re-booting!</p> Reply <br>

<p>I do one 24 hr fast a week and have really relaxed my meal schedule on the 
fed days, usually skipping breakfast with the exception of the occasional post 
workout shake. I have never found it easier to stay below 10% bodyfat and at 40 
yrs old I&rsquo;m quite happy about that. Even when I put on a couple pounds 
over the weekend, they come right off after the fast. I eat healthy by choice 
but I don&rsquo;t have to obsess over what I eat and even eat my fun foods with 
no worry.</p> 
<p>I have also found that my seasonal allergies are almost non existent since 
I started fasting and generally eating less often. I recommend it to everyone.

<p>Hi folks &ndash; great post, great replies. I read them all, every last 
one, over the last week or so. Now I have a question about my weight loss 
during Intermittent Fasting (IF).</p> 
<p>I&#146;m a 51 year old male, 5&#146;11&#148;, and this year I used the low 
carb way of eating to drop from a BMI of 27.5 to 23 over the last several 
months. My goal is BMI 22, or 158 lbs &ndash; basically college weight.</p> 
<p>I hit a plateau for several weeks &amp; wasn&#146;t dropping any more 
weight while continuing to eat induction levels of carbs, so I started IF just 
a couple of weeks ago. I do two 36-hour fasts (e.g. fast from Mon dinner to Wed 
breakfast) per week and I&#146;ve completed four of these.</p> 
<p>My fast is as honest a fast as I can make it &ndash; just coffee (no sugar 
or cream), iced tea, water, and chicken broth with a little extra pepper on 
fasting days. I drink a good amount of water (at least 3 liters) because I 
realize that caffeine is a diuretic.</p> 
<p>My records show I&#146;m losing about 2.5lbs during the fast and regaining 
1.0 to 1.5lbs after each fast, so during each of these two weeks I&#146;ve been 
fasting, I&#146;ve lost a little over two pounds a week.</p> 
<p>Now of course I don&#146;t subscribe completely to the &#147;3500 calories 
equals one pound&#148; equation because I know the body plays games with the 
metabolism when given too many or too few calories. But what I wonder is this 
&ndash; if my typical diet is 2000 to 2500 calories and I&#146;m only skipping 
one day of feeding, how am I averaging a full pound of real loss with each fast?
</p> 
<p>I love it but it seems impossible.</p> Reply <br>

<p>Wow, this is absolutely fascinating about BDNF. </p> 
<p>This is of particular interest for me because I&rsquo;m currently reading 
The Brain That Changes Itself (great book on neuroplasticity),and now this get 
me thinking that IF is like putting our brain&rsquo;s on natural steroids. 
Awesome!!!</p> 
<p>From personal experience, I&rsquo;ve been doing daily 16 hours fasts for 10 
days now, and my performance on Brain Training games at luminosity.com has 
risen significantly. I&rsquo;ve also noticed that I feel sharp even on when I 
don&rsquo;t sleep enough, which is totally new to me.</p> 
<p>I started fasting to improve my physical performance in the upcoming 
Anaconda Race (world&rsquo;s largest adventure race)- you can read the story at

<p>Hi there. Nice writeup </p> 
<p>I especially liked and thought about the part with allergies. I&rsquo;m 
allergic myself (pollen, mainly), and during puberty I had enormous problems 
with it. Ofcourse, during puberty, a tall growing lad has to eat a huge amount 
of calories just to keep up with the basic metabolic rate, and eating that many 
calories requires either eating until you almost throw up or eating 5-8 times 
per day (which I did). I was told that &ldquo;allergies are usually worst 
during puberty and sometimes even go away completely at the age of 
18-20&Prime;. So far, this still seems to be the widely observed fact.</p> 
<p>I still have some spurious problems with it, but mainly only around 
midsummer now (a very much observed holiday in sweden, with tons of food served 
many times per day). That&rsquo;s quite interesting, since midsummer is usually 
a bit too early for fir and grass to be blooming fully where I live, but during 
the pollen peaks I generally have very little problems at all.</p> 
<p>Do you think the less frequent eating patterns of adults compared to 
teenage guys could affect this? If so, just skipping food every other day, or 
even just skipping breakfast, might be a very good way of alleviating allergic 
problems. I&rsquo;d be interested in your thoughts on the matter.</p> 
<p>Thanks again for a good article.</p> Reply <br>

<p>I find it interesting that there are so many women reporting weight loss 
success with IF when on lots of the other threads there are so many women 
wondering why they can&rsquo;t lose weight. I accidentally IFed last Wednesday, 
eating nothing after breakfast until breakfast on Thursday. I ate dinner on 
Thursday and then ate nothing except coffee with cream until dinner on Friday. 
I finally have seen some weight loss after 6 weeks of low carb and seeing 
nothing. I&rsquo;m going to see if I can continue, at least every Wednesday 
since that is easiest for me, and hopefully a second day whenever possible.</p>

<p>I have been doing the daily fasts (i.e. eat between 4 pm and 8 pm every 
day). Sometimes i add low carb in and I tend to lose more weight but most of 
the time I still eat whatever i want.</p> 
<p>With my last pregnancy I was gestational diabetic and my doctor told me 
that I would be for every pregnancy after that. It took be 2 years to conceive 
that pregnancy. After 6 months of IF I lost 37 pounds. I didn&rsquo;t feel 
hungry during the day any more and my energy is increased.</p> 
<p>We decided start trying to have another baby, expecting it to be a couple 
of years before I would get conceive. I got pregnant on the first try and I was 
NOT gestational diabetic with this baby. By the way, no, I did not IF while 
pregnant. I stopped when I found out but I was more intune with my hunger and I 
only ate when I hungry. I know that once I am done breast feeding and get back 
on IF, my baby weight will fly off of me. Not to mention that I only gained 20 
pounds during the pregnancy because IF taught me how to eat!</p> Reply <br>

<p>I have been doing a form of this for about 8 months, and lately have been 
backsliding a little. I&rsquo;m trying to get myself back on track.<br>
 My 
question is, if I slip a little and eat something, should I just bag it for the 
day, or do I still get some benefit if I stop it right there and continue to 
&ldquo;fast.&rdquo; (I&rsquo;m using an eating window of 5 hours every evening).

<p>The China Study is something to consider with this. I do IF as a 
practicality, but I&rsquo;m also completely vegan. I have fluxuated from a vege 
to vegan diet the last few years. A couple years back I did the master cleanse, 
and followed up with disciplined eating schedules. My HGH went through the roof 
and I saw remarkable strength gains. I also became more tolerant to cold water 
and intense summer heat.<br>
 I really believe that finishing the evening meal 
while the sun is still bright is congruent with natural cycles. Ever tried 
lighting a fire in the dark?<br>
 You&rsquo;ll feel fatigued at first if 
you&rsquo;re used to high meat intake, switching to a plant based diet. Stick 
with it and you will add years to your life. Get plenty of saturated fat, 
coconut oil is great. If you have to have animal based fat, make sure 
it&rsquo;s grass fed at least.</p> Reply <br>

<p>I have had adrenal fatigue.. it is much better now. I used to be so bad 
that I could hardly do much at all. Anyway, I don&rsquo;t think IF is very good 
for when your adrenals are compromised. I found, doing IF, that at first I lost 
weight and felt really good, but after a while I stopped losing weight and 
started to get tired a lot again and having to take naps (it is almost 
involuntary, I HAVE to sleep, not normal tiredness) so I stopped doing it. 
Since then, I have done better eating low glycemic (got a blood sugar monitor 
and found I&rsquo;m borderline diabetic- I didn&rsquo;t think I could have real 
insulin problems because I work physically hard and ate decent but that&rsquo;s 
apparently no guarantee!) and smaller meals more often. I don&rsquo;t buy that 
idea of it keeping your metabolism up, but I think the reason it helps some 
lose weight is because they don&rsquo;t ever spike their blood sugar. I think 
the reason I liked IF so much was because my body so craved having a high blood 
sugar that I only seemed to get from a large meal (I didn&rsquo;t care for 
sweets a whole lot for the most part, not like you would think) so it was worth 
it not to eat in order to get to eat a real meal. I had a hard time feeling 
satisfied from food. Since going low glycemic (plenty of protein and fat, good 
fat that is), I have lost about 8 lbs. They have come off slow about a lb a 
week but all of it&rsquo;s been from my belly. Also, my lower back pain is 
going away as have my stomach problems (the main thing is when I would run it 
would sometimes throw my stomach into unbearable cramps- I&rsquo;ve had 
pancreatitis before and I&rsquo;d say these are comparable, they&rsquo;re that 
painful, also my stomach would overract to herbal laxatives). Now that 
I&rsquo;ve done just low GI for a couple months, I think throwing a fast in 
here and there would be ok, but doing it too often was probably too hard on my 
adrenals much as I hate to admit it.</p> Reply <br>

1.0 to 1.5lbs after each fast, so during each of these two weeks I&#146;ve been 
fasting, I&#146;ve lost a little over two pounds a week.</p> 
<p>Now of course I don&#146;t subscribe completely to the &#147;3500 calories

</p> 
<p>I love it but it seems impossible.</p> 
<p>[ Update on Dec 29 2011 ]</p> 
<p>I&rsquo;ve completed 14 of these 36-hour fasts and also have been doing 
shorter fasts where I just skip breakfast and lunch. I&#146;m just a pound or 
two away from my goal weight now &ndash; the fasting has helped me shed over 10 
pounds since my plateau in October.</p> 
<p>Overall I&rsquo;m very happy with the results &ndash; I may not be losing a 
full pound from a single day of fasting, but I&rsquo;m still finding 
intermittent fasting to be much easier to handle psychologically than trying to 
use portion control to reduce calorie intake. Although I haven&rsquo;t really 
experienced a &ldquo;euphoria&rdquo; that some folks report while fasting, I do 
feel mentally sharper and I certainly get a euphoric kick out of the first meal 
I use to break my fast!</p> 
<p>I&rsquo;ll continue to use the 24-hour fast (skipping bkfst and lunch only) 
for maintenance in 2012. Happy New Year to everyone!</p> Reply <br>

<p>Geez Jim, I&rsquo;ve pretty much do what you do, only 2- 36 hour fasts a 
week&ndash; been doing it for at least two years at that pace, I&rsquo;m only 
about 10 pounds lighter than I was two years ago in the fall. I&rsquo;m 57 
5&rsquo;4&rdquo; about 190 lbs, I was about 200 back then. I&rsquo;m a chubby 
little fella. There are so many postive testimonies here to the efficacy of IF, 
maybe it&rsquo;s helpful to hear of someone that struggles in it? I don&rsquo;t 
really struggle, cuz I like the way I feel doing it, and, I&rsquo;d be 500 lbs 
if I didn&rsquo;t. But it&rsquo;s so odd that everyone looses significant wt. 
in such a short time and I&rsquo;m still and chubbly little guy over two years 
of doing If?</p> Reply <br>

<p>Sounds interesting. I am 51 and 6 foot tall. I weighed 195 pounds 6 months 
ago and lost 25 pounds on caloric restriction. Now I weigh 170 pounds. Even 
though my weight is ideal for my height my wife says I look too skinny. Perhaps 
I can use intermittent fasting and get the benefits without losing further 
weight.</p> Reply <br>

<p>Hello Doc  I love this IF thing!<br>
 I just think maybe am not doing 
enough as I can&rsquo;t stand coffee without cream and just having tea and 
water I get a little sick. I am VERY insulin resitant; I don&rsquo;t know if I 
am hypoglycemic or that is what I am feeling. I do know if I eat breakfast skip 
lunch ugh really sick.<br>
 My question is am I am doing a little mostly 
harmless cheating (I do the fast every other day till 6PM thing three days a 
week) or am I ruining all my efforts? The most important thing is to have good 
blood sugar levels although I need to lose weight too. I do eat healthy, by 
preference. Thank you thank you!</p> Reply <br>

<p>@mory &ndash; you said &rdquo; it&#146;s so odd that everyone looses [sic] 
significant wt.&rdquo;. Dr. Eades doesn&rsquo;t suggest significant weight loss 
is obtained with IF; you just get a number of health benefits from it. He 
mentioned losing &ldquo;a little&rdquo; weight because he &amp; his wife 
&ldquo;couldn&#146;t eat twice as much during the eating days as we would have 
eaten were we not fasting&rdquo;. At your BMI=33 (comfortably into the obese 
range) I&rsquo;d wager you&rsquo;d find the weight loss you&rsquo;re looking 
for with a strict low carb approach. IF is an idea to consider when 
you&rsquo;re at normal weight &amp; considering ways to maintain that new 
weight.</p> 
<p>@eran &ndash; Clearly 170lbs on a 6&rsquo;0&Prime; adult frame isn&rsquo;t 
&ldquo;too skinny&rdquo; no matter what chart you might consult. At BMI=23 
you&rsquo;re in the middle of the normal range. Maybe you&rsquo;re wife is just 
worried about the looks you&rsquo;re getting from the other chicks </p> 
<p>@Anne &ndash; If you&rsquo;re saying that you&rsquo;re 
&ldquo;cheating&rdquo; with a little cream in your coffee, it shouldn&rsquo;t 
be too much of problem. I n a reply he made to a September 15, 2006 post by 
Esther Hoff (above), Dr. Mike said Dr. Mary does the same thing while 
IF&rsquo;ing. I do kind of agree with him when he suggests folks should 
&ldquo;buck up&rdquo; and drink it black. Personally any food I label as 
something I can&rsquo;t live without is one I should strongly consider living 
without &ndash; are you really a slave to a specific substance like *cream*? Oh 
wait, double standard, I can&rsquo;t live without black coffee myself </p> 
<p>I did want to add one more thing about IF to folks who aren&rsquo;t already 
low-carbing it. Before I started low-carbing, I couldn&rsquo;t imagine skipping 
a meal. If a meal was even an hour late, I always felt desperately hungry, 
fatigued, and very cranking. I&rsquo;m pretty sure now that it was the blood 
sugar spikes &amp; valleys caused by consuming carbs while being borderline 
insulin resistant &ndash; just like most Americans in middle age. So my strong 
suggestion for anyone overweight is to try a strict low-carb regimen first, and 
then consider IF only when you&rsquo;ve reached normal weight. It&rsquo;s the 
only way I could have done it.</p>

<p>Good luck everyone &amp; keep this post alive!</p> Reply <br>
