<p><strong>The Olive Industry under siege in Palestine</strong><br>
 David's 
Reports, BostontoPalestine, October 8 - 20, 2004</p> 
<p> <strong>Olive Groves in Disrepair</strong></p> 
<p>Today we worked in the olive groves of the village of Hares. It was a 
revelation to find out what well-tended olive groves look like. All the groves 
I had seen before today belonged to the farmers of Mas-Ha and were beyond the 
Annexation Fence (a &quot;Security Fence&quot; if you're Israeli!). They were 
overgrown with thistles and weeds, and the terrace walls and boundary walls 
were in a poor state of repair. It made the work of picking the olives much 
more arduous and dangerous.</p> 
<p>In my ignorance I had just assumed that Palestinians don't pay a great deal 
of attention to these things, after all it's not unusual for farmers anywhere 
in the world to allow groves and orchards to grow quite wild. It seemed a 
little strange though, since at some point in the past they had obviously taken 
the trouble of building the walls, but having no way to find out more I was 
left with my assumptions.</p> 
<p>The olive groves of Hares revealed not only my ignorance of how much the 
farmers care for their land, but also my lack of understanding of the impact of 
the Annexation Boundary Fence on the farmers of Mas-Ha. The groves of Hares are 
those classically beautiful terraced groves, rambling down the hillside, with 
lovely sandstone terrace and boundary walls, and ploughed and weeded dry earth. 
They look so tidy in a very organic and ancient way. They have been here, 
looking like this since antiquity. Omar, the man we were working with today, 
said that his fields had been in his family for generations, and the trees we 
were picking were at least one hundred years old.</p> 
<p> The farmers of Hares do not have to contend with the Annexation Fence, so 
they can access and tend their land more often than the farmers of Mas-Ha, who 
before this week hadn't been allowed to get to their land for nine months. The 
farmers of Hares who have land near the settlement of Revava still cannot get 
to it as often as they would like. Omar, the farmer we worked with today, said 
that he had only been on his land twice this year, once to plough and repair 
walls, and the second time was now - to harvest. His land abuts the settlement 
boundary fence. Well, actually the settlement has been built on his land and 
the land of other farmers of Hares - stolen from them by the settlers with the 
complicity and assistance of the Israeli government.more.. </p>

<p> The Bethlehem Arab Women's Union (BAWU) has a long history of community 
service, dating back to 1947 when it was founded as a first aid center to care 
for refugees from the first Arab-Israeli war. Located in the Old City of 
Bethlehem, the Union strives to meet the needs of the Bethlehemites of all 
ages, organizing luncheons for senior citizens, activities for youth, and 
income-generation projects for women through food and craft production. It also 
runs the Bethlehem Museum, where one can learn about local cultural heritage.
</p> 
<p>The Union&rsquo;s embroidery project aims for the preservation and revival 
of Bethlehem heritage and for meeting the economic needs of women in the area. 
When the embroidery project was established in 1968 to respond to worsening 
life conditions with the beginning of the Israeli occupation, the women began 
by collecting old dresses and studying the local embroidery tradition.</p> 
<p>According to Elen Eloussie, who runs the embroidery project, the Christian 
and Muslim women in Bethlehem historically shared the common heritage of 
embroidery. Women identified themselves by their village of origin rather than 
the religion, by wearing an embroidered dress with the distinct patterns and 
colors of each village.more.. &nbsp; </p> <b>More about Products from our

<strong>When it is illegal to use your front door: Freedom of 
movement in Al Khalil</strong> <br>
Andreas, International Solidarity 
Movement&nbsp;2/23/2012<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Al-Khalil (Hebron) 
is a divided city. As a result of the Oslo agreements negotiated in the 1990s 
&#150; the people of Al Khalil became familiar with two new terms &#150; H1 and 
H2. H1 refers to 80% of the city, which is officially under control of the 
Palestinian Authority, while H2 makes up the remaining 20% and falls under full 
Israeli military control. In area H2 Palestinians are daily exposed to human 
rights violations to an extent that can hardly be overestated. Israel severely 
restricts Palestinian freedom of movement in H2 in the name of 
&#148;separation,&#148; but in practice this is a policy of segregation.<br>
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Passing through Checkpoint 56, one of eleven permantly 
staffed checkpoints betweeen H1 and H2, the consequences of this policy can be 
heard, seen, and smelled. Passing through the checkpoint, the scents, sounds 
and sights of the vibrant commercial city center give way to a deserted area 
where the only people to be seen are a few settlers strolling down emptied 
streets and Israeli soldiers posted on rooftoops and street corners.<br>
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Punishing the victims<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
According to the latest UN report on freedom of movement in the West Bank, 
there are 90 different closure obstacles in the H2-area, that all interfere 
with freedom of movement for the Palestinians living in or having errands in 
H2. Closure obstacles can be staffed checkpoints, roadblocks, electric fences 
with barbed wire, and more. Along with these closures, Israel has imposed a ban 
on all Palestinian vehicular traffic on Shuhada street, which was once the 
vibrant main street &#150; connecting the North with West of Al-Khalil. In 
large sections of Shuhada Street, the Israeli army also enforces a ban on 
pedestrian traffic.<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Oslo Agreement gave 
Israel the chance to normalize and justify military emergency conditions and 
zones, already in place since 1994. That year a known member of the settler 
community of Khalil, Baruch Goldstein, walked fully armed into the Ibrahami 
Mosque and killed 29 people &#150; injuring a over 100.... -- See also:When it

<strong>Where is the &#145;inevitable&#146; 
Bedouin Intifada Israel guaranteed?</strong> <br>
Mya Guarnieri, +972 
Magazine&nbsp;2/9/2012<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 2004, Israeli 
officials were up in arms about an impending Bedouin Intifada. But the Bedouin 
didn&#146;t rebel and now, despite plans to expel tens of thousands of them 
from their homes in the West Bank and the Negev, things remain relatively 
quiet. Why?<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As Israel steps up its expansionist 
policies both inside and outside the Green Line, the Bedouin community has come 
under particularly intense pressure.<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Inside 
Israel, the state seeks to Judaize the Negev (Naqab) desert. This 
&#147;development&#148; includes last year&#146;s Prawer plan, which recommends 
that Israel relocate between 30,000 and 40,000 Bedouin citizens, ripping them 
from their villages and sticking them in impoverished townships, to clear the 
area for Jewish-only settlements.<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the 
Israeli cabinet passed the Prawer plan in September 2011, Adalah Legal Center 
for Arab Minority Rights in Israel likened it to &#147;a declaration of 
war.&#148;<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Al Arakib could be considered an 
opening battle. The state first demolished the unrecognized village in July 
2010&#151;destroying homes and tearing olive trees from the ground to make way 
for a forest to be planted by the Keren Kayemeth LeIsrael-Jewish National Fund 
(KKL-JNF). After the Bedouin residents of Al Arakib rebuilt their village, 
Israeli forces returned and destroyed it again. Since then, Al Arakib has been 
demolished and rebuilt over 30 times.<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Israel&#146;s policies are just as inhumane on the other side of the Green 
Line, where the so-called &#147;Civil Administration&#148; seeks to remove 
27,000 Bedouin from Area C in order to expand illegal Israeli settlements. The 
Civil Administration&#146;s plans will be carried out over the next three to 
six years. more.. e-mail<br>

<strong>A new stage for 
West Bank popular resistance</strong> <br>
Dylan Collins, Palestine 
Monitor&nbsp;1/28/2012<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In a hazy room, 
clouded with cigarette smoke and steam from hot syrup-sweat tea, residents of 
Kafr ad-Dik&nbsp;and its neighboring villages, along with Palestinian, Israeli, 
and international activists, excitedly gathered together waiting for the midday 
prayer to finish. The twenty-seventh of January marked the fourth Friday during 
which the village of Kafr ad-Dik has staged a nonviolent protest against the 
annexation of its agricultural land by the Israeli Occupation Authority (IOA).
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The village of Kafr ad-Dik, and the greater 
Salfit District, is located on top of the largest water table in the West Bank, 
thus providing it with some of the most fertile land in the region. Home to 
generations upon generations of farmers, Kafr ad-Dik, and the neighboring 
villages of Rafat, Balut, and Bruqin, have had the majority of their 
agricultural land stripped away from them in the last ten years by the IOA. In 
turn unemployment and poverty rates in the farming-based community have 
skyrocketed.<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In a village of which 99% of the 
inhabitants are olive farmers, the IOA&#146;s annexation of the majority Kafr 
ad-Dik&#146;s groves has been devastating.<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Approximately 4,000 dunams of vital agricultural land, shared by the four 
villages, has been appropriated by the IOA over the past ten years. Last month, 
the IOA significantly increased its total of annexed land in the area when it 
earmarked an additional 1,000 dunums for the alleged expansion of the nearby 
illegal Israeli outost, Ale Zahav. Kafr ad-Dik residents, however, are 
convinced this latest annexation of land will be allocated to the construction 
of an entirely new outpost.<br>

<strong>In Palestine, to Exist Is to Resist
</strong> <br>
Melinda Tuhus, In These Times&nbsp;1/24/2012<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Behind the headlines, Palestinians are using 
nonviolent direct action to protest the status quo.</i><br>
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Few readers of mainstream media are aware of 
Palestinians' longstanding creative efforts to use non-violent direct action in 
their struggle for self-determination.<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; WEST BANK, 
PALESTINE &#150; On November 15, Mazin Qumsiyeh and other Palestinian activists 
boarded public bus number 148, an Israelis-only bus that normally takes Jews 
from the Israeli West Bank settlement of Ariel to Jerusalem. The bus took the 
group to the Hizma checkpoint, just outside the northern entrance of Jerusalem, 
where activists resisted authorities&#146; efforts to remove them. Eventually, 
as a camera broadcast the action online, eight people were pulled from the bus 
and arrested. They were charged with &#147;illegal entry to Jerusalem&#148; and 
&#147;obstructing police business.&#148;<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Qumsiyeh 
hopes this recent &#147;freedom ride&#148; &#150; possible because a bus driver 
let them ride by mistake, he said &#150; will spark the same kind of response 
that its namesake did across the United States in the early 1960s, when 
interstate bus trips helped end racial segregation in the South. Qumsiyeh, 
author of Popular Resistance in Palestine: A History of Hope and Empowerment, 
says other examples of nonviolent resistance include protests of the separation 
barrier (which many Palestinians call an &#147;apartheid wall&#148;) that has 
effectively turned 10 percent of Palestinian land into Israeli land since its 
construction began in 2002; school girls holding class in the street when they 
can&#146;t get to their schools because of Israeli interference; and farmers 
braving Israeli intimidation to harvest olives. &#147;For us to exist on this 
land is to resist,&#148; says Qumsiyeh, who teaches at Bethlehem and Birzeit 
universities.<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most readers of mainstream media in 
the United States think of the First Intifada (1987-92) as the stone-throwing 
uprising and the Second Intifada (2000-2004) as the attack of the suicide 
bombers.... more.. e-mail<br>

<strong>Israeli 
army fails to protect Palestinian children</strong> <br>
Operation Dove, 
Alternative Information Center&nbsp;1/19/2012<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; According to a new report released by Operation 
Dove, Israeli authorities have been increasingly intransigent in their 
obligation to protect Palestinian children from settler violence in the South 
Hebron Hills this school year. The mandatory Israeli military escort that is 
supposed to ensure that Palestinian children arrive to school safely failed to 
walk with the children 95% of the time since the school year began in 
September. Soldiers and police also behaved aggressively towards Palestinians, 
forcing a pregnant women to spend 30 minutes at a flying checkpoint, for 
example, and aided settler harassment of Palestinians.<br>
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The month of December was characterized by increased 
Israeli military and police actions against the Palestinian communities of the 
South Hebron Hills. Several demolition orders were delivered to the community 
of Susya, including against a school, water tanks and trees. During a 
non-violent demonstration in the same village, a Palestinian male child was 
arrested. In some cases, as in the village of At- Tuwani, soldiers harassed 
local Palestinians, threatening and prohibiting them from calling the 
international volunteers of Operation Dove. There were random checkpoints and 
inspections, sometimes in the middle of the night, such as occurred in Umm 
Fagarah. In one case, soldiers stopped a car carrying a pregnant woman and sick 
child at a flying checkpoint outside of At-Tuwani; soldiers forced the family 
to remain there for more than thirty minutes. This month also saw Israeli 
settlers perpetrate violence against Palestinian property, destroying six olive 
trees.<br>

school children from Tuba and Maghayr Al-Abeed<br>

the military escort arrived on time, only in a few cases did the soldiers walk

Al Jab'a: &rsquo;If the judge is your enemy, who are you going to complain 
to&rsquo;</strong> <br>
Sarah Morand, International Solidarity 
Movement&nbsp;12/28/2011<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At first sight Al 
Jab&#146;a appears as an idyllic Palestinian village, and sitting in a lovely 
garden under big olive trees, this seems like a perfect escape to the country 
side: white houses, friendly people, nice nature, and a splendid view until you 
glance just 500 meters from the village&#146;s border.<br>
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Al Jab&#146;a is surrounded by illegal settlements, a 
soldier camp, one major checkpoint, the construction of the separation wall as 
well as one permanent roadblock which blocks access to Jab&#146;a&#146;s land 
and the neighboring village of Surif. Since Al Jab&#146;a only has about 1000 
inhabitants and lacks a hospital, markets, and high school, the restriction of 
movement means that everyone has to go two to three kilometers by foot in order 
to do their basic shopping and to reach school, work and healthcare. Sometimes 
even that is impossible.<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#147;When my wife was 
pregnant and was about to give birth, they didn&#146;t let us cross the 
checkpoint. They forced us to go back and my wife had to give birth at 
home,&#148; Naser, a senior of the village, said.<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
As Naser guided ISM volunteers through his village, the roadblock obstructing 
the village from free movement was visible. One women explained that since her 
husband is sick and she does not want to leave her children alone, she has to 
walk with them every 4th day to do the basic shopping and to buy milk for her 
baby.<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The restriction on movement should also be 
seen in context of everyday Israeli harassment which aim at making life 
unbearable in order to make people leave the village. Many houses have a 
demolition order as do its trees, plants, fences, walls and mailboxes. The big 
sign which welcomes visitors at the entrance has one and so do the two small 
plants that are put next to it. -- See also:ISM: More about Al Jab'a more..

<strong>Open letter from Gaza: Three years after the massacre,

Besieged Gaza, Occupied Palestine, 
International Solidarity Movement&nbsp;12/27/2011<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We, Palestinians of Gaza, 3 years on from the 
22-day long massacre in Israel&#146;s operation &#145;Cast Lead&#146;, are 
calling on international civil society to make 2012 the year when solidarity 
with us in Palestine captures the spark of the revolutions around the Arab 
world and never looks back. On this anniversary we demand an international 
liberation movement that eventually leads to just that, liberation for us 
Palestinians from 63 years of brutal military occupation and ethnic cleansing 
that pours shame on any organisation or government claiming to endorse 
universal human rights.<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We will never forget the 
hurt of 3 years ago, the criminal onslaught that we lived through, the blood of 
over 1400 murdered men, women and hundreds of children running through the 
streets of Gaza, between the rubble, soaking our beds and etched on our minds. 
We will never forget. For they are still dead, and thousands more are still 
maimed.[1]<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We will never forget the last 63 years 
during which our land, homes, olive groves, lemon trees and cherished way of 
life was taken away from us, while Israeli soldiers held our fathers&#146; 
faces in the sands, imprisoned them, or shot them in front of us. We will not 
forget the sickening cowardice of the international community that has allowed 
and enabled this ethnic cleansing of our people, subjecting us to Israel&#146;s 
racist Zionist vision that defines us, the indigenous people of Palestine, as 
the undesired &#145;ethnic group&#146; for the region.<br>
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The US continues to &#145;reward&#146; Israel with 6 
billion dollars of tax-payers money while the EU increases its trade and 
diplomatic relations. For the Israeli apartheid regime this translates as the 
green light to unleash the 4th most powerful military on us to &#145;do its 
worst&#146; against our civilian population, of which over half in Gaza are 
children and over 2 thirds are UN registered refugees. more.. e-mail<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One need not be an 
agronomist to know that its been a long time since the farmers of 
Khuza&quot;&#153;a, Gaza have tended to their land near the border.&nbsp; When 
we arrived on Friday, the densely packed soil formed small hills with alien, 
ridged, patterns: Israeli tanks had roamed here, dozens of them. It was hard to 
imagine how anything ever grew on this brown, barren soil, much less the 
hundreds of olive, orange and grapefruit trees the Qudaih family reminisced 
about.<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But those groves and the greenhouses too,

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Khaled Mahmood Suleiman Qudaih called us a few days 
before, asking us if we would accompany his family to his father&#146;s fields 
so that they could sow wheat. We met them inside a small tent and they 
explained to us the situation. The Qudiahs and many other farmers were afraid 
that the Israeli army would shoot them if the attempted to reach their land 
near the buffer zone. We informed them that we could not guarantee their 
safety, that the Israeli army had killed foreign civilians too.<br>
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Alas, our presence and our video cameras was all the 
impetus they needed to risk life and limb.<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On 
Friday, we arrived to the south Gaza village early, drank two cups of sugary 
tea with sage, jumped on a cart pulled by a white donkey, and were on our way. 
We slowly rode down the main street locals waving as we passed by. Then we head 
east out to the farmland, passing between giant slabs of concrete placed at the 
outskirts of the village in an attempt to protect children playing in the 
streets from Israeli army gunfire. -- See also:Notes from Behind the Blockade

Meanwhile in Gaza</strong> <br>
Radhika S, Notes from Behind the 
Blockade&nbsp;11/15/2011<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I awoke today with 
the news that the NYPD was clearing out Occupy Wall Street and that Israeli 
tanks were shelling &#147;northern Gaza.&#148; In the West Bank, Palestinian 
Freedom Riders, inspired by the US freedom riders of the 1960s, were getting 
ready to board segregated buses to occupied East Jerusalem.<br>
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here in Gaza, we head to Beit Hanoun for their weekly 
nonviolent protest in the buffer zone. For three years, Palestinians in the 
north have been marching into the barren, no-man&#146;s land which encircles 
the inside of the narrow strip like a slowly-tightening noose.<br>
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We arrived around 11 a.m. and gathered in front of a 
bombed-out house down a dusty road leading to the border. This was my second 
buffer zone protest. At my first, two weeks ago, the Israeli army had fired a 
few shots from the military towers at the border. I wondered what would happen 
today. As a foreigner, I was to don a reflective fluorescent yellow vest and 
walk in front of the Palestinians, which seemed to provide them a degree of 
solace. They seem to think that the Israelis were less likely to use lethal 
violence when Americans, Italians, and Brits walked with them.<br>
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was not so sure.<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; About 
two dozen people waving Palestinian flags marched down the dusty path towards 
the buffer zone. The landscape reminded me of home, of California, with its 
thorny tumbleweeds and cactus. It was hard to believe that only ten years ago 
fruit orchards and olive trees filled this area. But Israel had bulldozed it 
all, claiming it needed 300 kilometers of Gaza&#146;s most fertile land, but in 
reality taking more. more.. e-mail<br>

Remembering Arafat -- letter from a Palestinian diplomat</strong> <br>
Saadi 
Salama, Ma&rsquo;an News Agency&nbsp;11/10/2011<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr President, the first time I met you 30 years 
ago, I was studying at Hanoi University in Vietnam; that was only a few days 
after the assassination of Egyptian president Anwar Sadat in Cairo and the 
assassination in Rome of your brother-in-arms Majed Abo Sharar. I realized then 
that one might disagree with you but no one can refute you.<br>
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You are the father of Palestine, President Yasser 
Arafat. A supervisor, a freedom fighter, a peacemaker, a leader of compassion; 
you stood your ground and held on with a tight grip to both the olive branch 
and the freedom fighter's pistol.<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It has been 
exactly seven years since you departed, leaving bereft and orphaned a nation of 
stateless Palestinians whose cause you personified and promoted as no one else 
could.<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shortly before your death, you were asked 
by a journalist what you thought was your greatest achievement, and flashing 
your trademark face-splitting grin, you replied: &quot;We have made the 
Palestinian cause the biggest issue in the world &#133; 107 years after the 
Basel Conference, 90 years after the Sykes Picot Agreement, all conspiracies 
have failed to wipe us out.<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;We are here, in 
Palestine, facing them. We are not Red Indians.&quot;<br>
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seven years after your death, the Palestinian cause 
remains one of the biggest problems in the world, and despite their receding 
hopes of viable statehood in the West Bank and Gaza, Palestinians still 
consider a man, Abu Ammar, to have been the person responsible for making it so.

<strong>Israeli military 
profiling and assaulting international observers in Hebron</strong> <br>

International Solidarity Movement&nbsp;11/8/2011<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Novermber 5<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For 
over a week now, ISM activists have been continually harassed, and on one 
occasion assaulted, by Israeli soldiers who have frequently demanded that 
internationals to hand over possessions of their passports. This ongoing 
situation has occurred within the &#145;H2&#146; zone in the city of Hebron, 
which is notorious for its intense and illegal Israeli military presence due to 
a small number of Israeli citizens who have illegally invaded and occupied a 
historically significant part of the city.<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
According to Israeli law, soldiers have limited jurisdiction over 
internationals as internationals are governed by civil law (unlike the 
Palestinians who suffer under unjust military rule) and therefore only the 
Israeli police have the legal authority to demand an international or Israeli 
citizen to provide their passport for inspection. Despite this, the soldiers 
have continued to attempt to abuse their power, generally using tactics of 
intimidation and threats, in a vain hope that they will force the 
internationals to submit to their inflated sense of power.<br>
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This recent change of approach from the Israeli 
military towards internationals appears to have coincided with a strong 
international presence at a olive harvest within the &#145;H2&#146; zone during 
which Israeli soldiers refused Palestinians&#146; their inherent right to 
harvest their own land. It also appears that the arrival of a new commander, 
who infamously boasted, &#147;I am the law, I am god&#148; has also contributed 
to what incredibly may be a deterioration in the treatment Palestinians and 
internationals. In his short period in charge the commander has revoked a long 
established agreement that teachers; pregnant women and others with health 
issues do not have to pass through the radiation emitting checkpoint and must 
instead submit to being searched every time. It appears this commander has 
ambitions of promotion beyond the rank of, &#147;god&#148; and recognises that 
the path to this within the Israeli army is inhumane treatment of Palestinians 
and any who dare support them. more.. e-mail<br>

<strong>Palestinians Resist 
Settler Violence during Olive Harvest</strong><br>
Palestine Chronicle: 7 Nov 
2011 - By Ben Lorber, ISM, West Bank As this year's olive harvest sends 
Palestinian families across all of historic Palestine out to their olive trees, 
a new nonviolent resistance group called Refusing to Die In Silence is 
patrolling the West Bank, protecting harvesters from increased settler 
violence. The 2011 olive harvest, which began in early October, has seen a 
troubling rise in settler attacks. On October 20, OXFAM reported that Israeli 
settlers have already cost West Bank Palestinian farmers $500,000 this year in 
destroyed olive trees. In September alone, 2,500 olive trees were destroyed, 
out of 7,500 destroyed so far this year (and a conservative estimate of 800,000 
destroyed since Israel&rsquo;s annexation of the West Bank in 1967). This is 
particularly damaging because this year&rsquo;s olive harvest is expected to 
yield only half the oil of last year&rsquo;s harvest, making each tree all the 
more valuable more farmers. An interactive map...more<br>
<strong>We are here 
because we exist. The story of a shoemaker living in Hebron's H2</strong><br>

Stop The Wall - We are here because we exist. The story of a shoemaker living 
in Hebron's H2 Tamir: &quot;... they want to scare and despire us, they want us 
to leave the are, that is why they do this. But we are not leaving. We are here 
because we exist...&quot; Tamir or Abu Taleeb (The Father of Taleeb) is 
shoemaker and lives in the H2 are of Hebron's Old City. I met Tamir and his 
family the day when a group of young Palestinia and forigner volnteers met in 
his lands to harves olives. This group of volunteers went to help Tamir and his 
family because they practicaly live surrounded by Israeli stettlers. The old 
City of Hebron was divided in two areas: H1 under Palestinian control and H2 
under Israeli contro. This is the only Palestinian city where the stettlers are 
actualy inside the city and not in the near by settlements. Both zones are 
divided by a military check-point, which must be corssed by anyone willing to 
enter to the H2 area. Currently there 400 settlers living in the H2 area, who 
are protected by between 2,500 to 3,000 soldiers; and also about 30,000 
Palestinians live in that area. This has aroused tension in the are and for 
Tamir the work of harvesitng olives has turned very complicated, beyond the 
physical effort it may require. Tamir has to face the attaks of the settlers 
who are protected by the Israeli police and soldiers. To harvest olives takes 
time, as each one of the olives must be cut from the tree with the hands one by 
one, so that is why this year Tamir was helped by a group of volunteers. 
Harvesting olive that day was not easy, all the work was done while the 
volunteers were completely surronded by Israeli soldiers, policemen and 
settlers, who constantly provked the Palestinian and foreign volunteers. Tamir 
told me that in previous years when he and his family harvested the olives they 
were frequently attaked by th settlers who threw them stones while they were 
farming. The settlers also steal their olives, but Tamir explains me that the 
attack of the settlers does not only ocurre during the olive harvesting season, 
but it occure at any time at any moment at any places. The soldiers frequently 
arrived in Tamir's house to raid at, usually they arrived late night during 
wokrking days. &quot;They enter in the house and mess everything, they brake 
things and they do not let my children slepp when they have school at the 
following day, they also stand in the fernature. They enter in my house and 
make us go to one room. Whenever this happens at the following day my children 
are always scare of going out and run into the settlers,&quot; Tamir said. 
However, Tamir and his family not only have to face the soldiers, but also the 
settlers, he said that when his wife makes laundry, the settlers would come and 
make it dirty again. Last year, the Israeli authorites gave Tamir a permit to 
harvest his olives, only for one day and a couple of hours, for him not to be 
attacked by the settlers when doing it. Of course the times was not enough, so 
he continued harvesting the olives out of the permit time, untill he was 
arrested. Tamir was arrested for harvesting olives out of time. Luaghing, Tamir 
told me that at the moment when he was arrested, he was carrying a bucket full 
of olives, which untill know continues at the same place when he was arrested, 
as nbody can touch it according to the soldiers' orders. Tamir knows that he 
and his family cannot harvest all the olives in one day, so they need the help 
of volunteers, however, he told me that the presence of volunteers does not 
solve everything, because the olives can be harvested in one day, but in the 
other hand there is more tenssion, because the presnece of the soldiers and 
settlers near his house, increases. They just go to provoke the volunteers 
looking for clahses, he said. &quot;When there is a lot of people near by 
house, the presence of the stettlers increases, as well as the atacks,&quot; 
Tamir said. Tamir said that whenever his children leave house to go to school 
or other place he is worried, because the settlers can attack them. Tamir used 
to live in another house in the north of Hebron, however Israel confiscted 30 
dunums of his land and then the soldiers and the settlers pushed him to leave. 
The house where he lives now is rented. Tamir decided to live in the H2 are, 
for two reasons, as he said: the economic reason, which is important, but not 
the most important; and because he considered that if Palestinians give up, the 
settlers will occupy more Palestinian houses untill arrives the moment when 
there will not be one Palestinian in the H2 area. &quot;I live here to confirm 
my existance and prove that we are going to solve our presence in this 
land,&quot; Tamir said. &quot;The settlers want to scare us and be despair, 
they want us to leave this area, that is why they do all this. But we are not 
leaving. That is why we are here, because we exist and we are not going to 
allow them to kick us from our lands. This is our land and we ae not going to 
give up,&quot; Tamir said. Tamir also said that he know he is half alone in 
this struggle, and he asked me: &quot;Where are all those large international 
organization of Human Rights, the UN? We have 40 years of occupation and where 
are they? what are they doing?&quot; Finaly, Tamir told me that he dreams on 
the day when the Palestinians can live safe in their land and the settlers 
leave.<br>

<strong>Hebron copes with self deifying Israeli military and its settlers
</strong> <br>
Alistair George, International Solidarity Movement&nbsp;11/4/2011
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The streets of Tel Rumeida are locked-down 
and divided; physically occupied by a forceful Israeli military. For the 
Palestinian community living in this part of H2, Israeli-controlled Hebron, 
military occupation is an inescapable intrusion into everyday reality. The 
existence of an estimated 500 Israeli settlers is facilitated by up to 4000 
Israeli soldiers stations in Hebron. Grey, austere watchtowers gaze over 
streets in which Israeli soldiers and military vehicles are stationed at 
regular intervals, frequently stopping Palestinians as they walk through their 
own neighbourhood to demand they prove their identity. Those wishing to travel 
into H2 from Palestinian-controlled H1 must pass through metal detectors and 
checkpoints, where they may be arbitrarily harassed or detained by bored 
Israeli soldiers.<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Movement around H2 is severely 
restricted. In some streets Palestinians are allowed to walk but not drive, 
forcing them to manually lug heavy supplies such as gas canisters and food. 
Even ambulances are not allowed to drive through certain areas. Palestinians 
are forbidden from passing through some streets by car or by foot; the main 
street linking north and south Hebron has been closed to Palestinians; turning 
a 5 minute journey into a 45 min trek through alternative roads.<br>
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, despite the enduring hardship in Tel Rumeida, 
resistance to the Israeli occupation remains strong. The &#145;Study and 
Challenge Centre&#146; is located on Palestinian land that is surrounded by 
four Israeli settlements &#150; the closest of which is only metres from the 
rear of the building. It faces south Hebron, overlooking steep, dusty terraces, 
planted with olive trees and cratered by old archaeological digs of excavated 
Roman artifacts. The centre is a hub of nonviolent resistance and its existence 
is a testament to the spirit that exists in a beleaguered community under 
occupation.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Notes and Stories from the Olive Harvest: 
Palestinian farmers tell stories of intimidation, vandalism and violence from 
settler neighbors, as they attempt to harvest their olives.</i><br>
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Israeli settler violence against Palestinian farmers 
during the olive season is not an exception. It is the norm. It is the norm 
encouraged by the settler leadership, which, in turn is supported by the 
government. This violence ranges from the blows delivered from masked, 
rod-wielding youth accompanied by an armed guard in Jalud last week, to the 
violent mob outside of Anatot last month, to scores of instances of tree 
burning or uprooting. For Palestinian farmers, settler violence against them or 
their property is a practically a daily occurrence.<br>
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And yet, much of Israeli society is either unaware of 
the extent of the violence, or unwilling to call it anything other than 
&#147;the random actions of a few fanatics.&#148;<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
But it is much deeper and more disturbing than simply &#147;the random actions 
of a few fanatics.&#148;<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is policy.<br>
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, the acts of violence themselves are generally 
carried out by a &#147;few fanatics.&#148; But the actions of these few 
fanatics correspond directly to settler policy, which, while not explicitly 
declared, is certainly normatively inscribed. Rabbi Yitzhak Shapira&#146;s 
Torat HaMelekh was not an aberration. It was simply a codification of the 
&#147;religiously&#148; framed devaluation of all non-Jewish life that is 
rampant throughout the settlements. Moreover, Rabbi Shapira&#146;s Yeshiva in 
the settlement of Yitzhar has received substantial government funding. more..

<strong>Jerusalem Day, 2011</strong> <br>
Christopher J. Lee, 
Jerusalem Quarterly File&nbsp;10/29/2011<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Autumn, 2011<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The story is one that has become 
engrained in the history of the city. On June 7, 1967, Israeli paratroopers 
invaded the Old City of Jerusalem, fighting their way from the Mount of Olives 
to enter through the Lions&#146; Gate, eventually reaching the Western 
Wall&#151;the most sacred religious site for Jews around the world. The capture 
of Jerusalem during the Six-Day War (June 5-10, 1967) between Israel, Egypt, 
Jordan, and Syria was not fully anticipated, given the United Nations presence 
in the city and the accords that had been reached through the 1949 Armistice 
Agreements following the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. Israel started the Six-Day War 
through a surprise air strike on Egyptian air force bases. However, 
Jordan&#146;s alliance with Egypt and Syria and its consequent attack on 
Israeli positions in West Jerusalem provided a pretext for the Israeli assault, 
one that fulfilled long-standing Zionist ambitions for the city and led to the 
Israeli occupation of the entire West Bank&#151;a legacy that continues to this 
day.<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jerusalem Day commemorates this event for 
Israelis. First established in 1968 and made a national holiday in 1998, it 
marks an annual occasion to celebrate the repossession of the Western Wall and 
the unification of Jerusalem under Israeli control more generally. With support 
from the Israeli government, it has also become an attraction specifically for 
Zionist youth groups from the United States, Europe, and other nations to come 
and fulfill the Passover Seder prayer of &#147;Next year in Jerusalem.&#148; 
But from a different political standpoint, this holiday has also reinforced the 
Israeli occupation for Palestinians, with Zionist youth and families 
re-enacting the 1967 entry into the Old City by rallying and chanting 
nationalist slogans as they proceed to the Western Wall. Instead of entering at 
the Lions&#146; Gate, the Damascus Gate has also served as the point of entry 
for the annual parade, encouraging participants to march through the historic 
Muslim Quarter in waves lasting from early afternoon to early evening. For a 
city whose complex history embodies so many religious, national, and ethnic 
narratives, Jerusalem Day marks a more exclusive and contested story of this 
city.... more.. e-mail<br>

<strong>The Olive and the F-16: Autumn in Gaza</strong> <br>
Radhika 
S, Notes from Behind the Blockade&nbsp;10/28/2011<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today completes another week of olive picking in 
Gaza. Another week of pausing, breaths held, as Israeli tanks the color of sand 
moved nearby along the buffer zone, another week of children frightened at the 
sound of roaring F-16s, another week below the watchful eye of the drone.<br>
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Together with the Beit Hanoun Local Initiative, 
International Solidarity Movement (ISM) volunteers picked olives with families 
near the buffer zone in the village of Burej and in two different locations in 
Beit Hanoun this week.<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#147;We&#146;re here to 
harvest olives and be with the land because this is our land and we don&#146;t 
want to abandon it,&#148; said 27-year-old Randa Hilou a local student to came 
to pick in solidarity with the farmers in Beit Hanoun.<br>
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On Wednesday, dozens of local children joined in the 
picking. I asked the children why they had come. &#147;I&#146;m here to pick 
olives,&#148; declared 9-year-old Mahmoud, taking a break from dumping olives 
into a blue plastic crate. &#147;We love olives,&#148; added other children, 
who gathered around.<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At one point in the day, the 
sound of Israeli F-16s could be heard overhead. &#147;I went picking with my 
mother and father,&#148; added Bursa, also 9-years-old. &#147;I am not 
afraid.&#148;<br>

<strong>VIDEO - Olive harvest brings settler 
violence in West Bank</strong> <br>
Joseph Dana, +972 Magazine&nbsp;10/21/2011
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the outskirts of the northern West Bank 
village of Qasra, a 19-year-old resident recently told me that settlers are not 
going to stop attacking Palestinians, simply because they don&#146;t have too. 
According to the man, settlers live in a world of no consequence as if removed 
from the normal social contract of Western societies. One look at this 
year&#146;s olive harvest, taking place throughout the West Bank over the next 
two weeks, proves the statement to be correct.<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
This morning (Friday), a group of armed settlers from the illegal outpost of 
Ash Kodesh (Sacred/Holy Light) approached a group of Palestinians picking 
olives, accompanied by Israeli and international activists. The Palestinians 
were from the nearby village of Jalud and had been picking olives in peace 
until settlers descended from their outpost. The settlers claim that the 
Palestinians &#147;provoked&#148; them by throwing stones, a claim denied by 
the Palestinians and activists. Settlers also noted that the Palestinians did 
not get permission from the proverbial master of the land &#150; the Israeli 
army &#150; to have an olive harvest. You can read their fantastic 
understanding of how the events unfolded on Ynet.<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Palestinians claim that the settler attack was driven by pure malice. As you 
can see in the embedded video, many settlers had covered their faces with 
masks, with some carrying metal poles in addition to several firearms. Had the 
settlers only been defending themselves, one wonders why they would cover their 
faces&#151;a practice popular among setters engaged in wanton violent attacks 
on Palestinian civilians and their supporters.<br>

<strong>The Real Enemy of the Palestinians
</strong> <br>
Dr. Elias Akleh, Intifada-Palestine&nbsp;10/15/2011<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I was young I perceived the Zionist 
Israelis to be the Palestinians, and my, only enemy. The Zionist terrorist 
gangs had forcefully occupied my country, razed about 400 Palestinian towns, 
perpetrated many massacres against their Palestinian residents, and evicted 
many hundreds of thousands others out of the country into refugee camps. Among 
them was my family, whose property; home and ranch planted with citrus and 
olive trees and vineyards, were seized by Israeli terrorists.<br>
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Researching deep in the history and nature of the 
Arab/Israeli conflict, watching the unfoldment of the Palestinian struggle for 
freedom and independence against the savage Israeli oppression and territorial 
expansion, and examining the Western political policies towards the conflict I 
came to a new different realization. Israelis, themselves, are as victims as 
the Palestinians although to a very lesser extents. Those Israelis are being 
misguided, mass-brainwashed, and militarily driven by deliberately distorted 
and misinterpreted theology, political Rabbis, and Western Zionist imperialist 
powers to execute the colonial Zionist project of establishing Greater Israel 
in the heart of the Middle East.<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It has become 
obvious to all, by now, that Israel could not have been created nor could it 
continue to exist as a viable state without the assistance of the West 
especially the USA. Israel is a military subsidiary of the US; a 
forward-deployed American military base in the Middle East, who is totally 
dependent on American funds. Since its creation, 63 years ago, Israel received 
more American tax money, $3 Trillions as reported by Army War College in 2003, 
than any other country on earth. This money is used to cover the expenses of 
hoarding to Israel, housing, re-socializing, and absorbing every Zionist Jewish 
immigrant. It subsidizes homes for every Israeli citizen. It pays for free 
education of every Israeli child from elementary school until university 
graduation. It is used to create industries and jobs in Israel. It pays for 
complete medical coverage and for hefty monthly social security payment for 
every Israeli senior citizen. Even during the current economic crisis, when 
American tax-paying citizens are losing their jobs, losing their homes, the 
majority are without medical benefits.... -- See also:The Costs to American

<strong>Israel urged to clamp down on Jewish terror
</strong> <br>
Al-Ahram Weekly&nbsp;10/13/2011<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Desecration of graveyards and destruction of 
olive groves are just two manifestations of violence Palestinians -- on the 
West Bank and inside Israel -- face daily from Israeli society<br>
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Palestinian Authority (PA) as well as Arab leaders 
in Israel have urged the Israeli government to &quot;swiftly and decisively 
clamp down on spiralling Jewish terror and vandalism against Palestinian 
targets, including mosques and Islamic as well as Christian cemeteries&quot;, 
writes Khaled Amayreh in occupied Jerusalem.<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The 
latest call came after suspected Jewish terrorists vandalised and defaced 
Muslim and Christian graves at the main cemetery of Jaffa. Some of the graves 
there date back several centuries.<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Other Muslim 
leaders, including some Knesset members, reminded Jews in Israel and abroad 
that, &quot;This is how the holocaust started.&quot;<br>
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He accused &quot;powerful political circles&quot; 
within the Israeli government, army and police of &quot;treating with extreme 
leniency the perpetrators of such crimes.&acirc;--&ecirc;&#156;I believe that 
the government of Binyamin Netanyahu, which is the most extreme government in 
Israel's history, lacks both the will and determination to stem the tide of 
Jewish terror. Therefore, I expect this worrying phenomenon to continue and 
even escalate.&quot;<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Last week, unidentified 
Jewish saboteurs, believed to be affiliated with an underground Jewish terror 
group in the West Bank, set the local mosque at the Israeli Palestinian village 
of Tuba Zangariya on fire. The fire gutted the interior of the mosque, burning 
Quranic texts and other sacred objects. The attack was widely condemned by the 
Arab community throughout Israel and the occupied territories. more.. e-mail<br>

<strong>The CIA and the Iran Caper</strong> <br>
Ray Mcgovern, 
CounterPunch&nbsp;10/14/2011<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Which 
other government in the Middle East would like nothing better than to see 
relations between Iran and the United States take a big step toward military 
confrontation?&quot;<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Washington Post columnist 
David Ignatius, in his accustomed role as unofficial surrogate CIA spokesman, 
has thrown light on how the CIA under its new director, David Petraeus, helped 
craft the screenplay for this week&#146;s White House spy feature: the 
Iranian-American-used-car-salesman-Mexican-drug-cartel plot to assassinate the 
Saudi ambassador to the U.S.<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Thursday&#146;s 
column, Ignatius notes that, initially, White House and Justice Department 
officials found the story &#147;implausible.&#148; It was. But the Petraeus 
team soon leapt to the rescue, reflecting the 
four-star-general-turned-intelligence-chief&#146;s deep-seated animus toward 
Iran.<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before Ignatius&#146;s article, I had seen 
no one allude to the fact that much about this crime-stopper tale had come from 
the CIA. In public, the FBI had taken the lead role, presumably because the key 
informant inside a Mexican drug cartel worked for U.S. law enforcement via the 
Drug Enforcement Administration.<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, 
according to Ignatius, &#147;One big reason [top U.S. officials became 
convinced the plot was real] is that CIA and other intelligence agencies 
gathered information corroborating the informant&#146;s juicy allegations and 
showing that the plot had support from the top leadership of the elite Quds 
Force of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps, the covert action arm of the 
Iranian government.&#148;<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ....But it IS as 
implausible as it sounds, says every professional intelligence officer I have 
talked with since the &#147;plot&#148; was somberly announced on Tuesday. more..

Ramzy Baroud, Al-Ahram Weekly&nbsp;9/8/2011<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Documenting a misguided congresswoman's war on 
the UN.</i><br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From an Israeli point of view, Ileana 
Ros-Lehtinen is the ideal American politician. Although many in the US 
government aspire to her level of commitment to Israel, few can measure up to a 
dedication that extends so far beyond the interests of her own country. 
&quot;Lawless extremists infest Congress like crabgrass besets lawns. House 
Foreign Affairs Committee Chairwoman Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (R. FL) is one of the 
worst,&quot; writes US columnist Stephen Lendman.<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Ros-Lehtinen's r&eacute;sum&eacute; is a distressing read. The congresswoman 
&quot;endorses US imperial wars, police state laws, corporate empowerment, tax 
cuts for the rich, laying waste to Libya, perhaps a second Bay of Pigs, and 
Israeli lawlessness, while, at the same, opposing Palestinian statehood,&quot; 
according to Lendman.<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is, in fact, 
&quot;Israeli lawlessness&quot; and her opposition to a Palestinian statehood 
that has made her a darling to Israel and its lobby. Unsurprisingly, 
Ros-Lehtinen has been rewarded handsomely for her die-hard support of Israel by 
some of the most powerful pro-Israeli individuals and lobby groups in the 
United States.<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of these individuals is Irving 
Moskowitz, the well-known American Jewish millionaire, who made his fortune as 
a &quot;casino magnate&quot;. &quot;The benefactor of a controversial Jewish 
development in eastern Jerusalem is a major donor to US Representative Ileana 
Ros-Lehtinen,&quot; reported the Jewish Telegraph Agency on 11 January, shortly 
after the congresswoman claimed her new post. A high proportion of the revenue 
he made from the gambling industry has been used to demolish Palestinian homes, 
raze ancient olive trees and fund Jewish settlements. It has also been used to 
finance Ros-Lehtinen's campaigns. more.. e-mail<br>

ancient olive trees. The demonstrators succeeded in halting the razing of 
Palestinian land for approximately one hour before soldiers violently broke up 
the protest arresting one Palestinian and one Israeli activist.<br>
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On September 5th bulldozers protected by dozens of 
soldiers arrived at 4 AM and uprooted 50 olive trees that date back at least 
100 years. The bulldozers also destroyed 18 almond trees, 27 pine trees, and 8 
fruit trees. The destruction took place in an area of over 1 square mile and 
was declared a closed military zone, prohibiting media coverage of the 
devastating operation.<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mohammed Al-Atrash (Abu 
Wajih), the elderly farmer who owned the trees, will receive no compensation 
for his loss.<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the aftermath residents of Al

destruction carried out by the Israeli government. At approximately 10am on 
Tuesday several residents from the village, joined by ISM and other activists, 
walked down to the site of the olive grove, which is now a wasteland. Upon 
arriving they stood in front of the construction machines and forced them to 
halt their work.<br>

<strong>Making the Humanitarian 
Primitive: Time and Violence on the Eternal Frontier</strong> <br>
Peter 
Lagerquist, Jerusalem Quarterly File&nbsp;8/26/2011<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Summer<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Along the 
route of the West Bank&#146;s main north-west trunk road there is a passage of 
road some 20 minutes south of Hebron where the country&#146;s roiling sweep of 
silver olive groves begins to thin out, and the land grows noticeably more 
arid. As you descend the penultimate ridgeline before the southern border the 
concrete carapace of an army post floats by, tight up on a hardscrabble village 
where dusty farmer&#146;s children scatter fearfully on sighting a car with 
yellow Israeli license plates. At this point clusters of shacks and tents begin 
to appear on the surrounding slopes, some nearly two kilometers adrift adrift 
of the shoulder. As you progress past turnoffs for thinly spaced Israeli 
settlements, red- tiled roofs and agro-industrial cowsheds poised on the 
surrounding hilltops, these shacks slide in and out of view behind folds of 
scrubland, until a left turn past the settlement of Susyia takes you up to the 
edge of the frontier in the southern West Bank.<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Israel&#146;s Barrier snakes out of the western horizon here, fence and tarmac 
separating a last cluster of settler tract housing from a welter of native 
sheds, before finally dead- ending in a small terminal, comprising two booths 
straddling the road and a clump of concrete barracks. Looking east across 
unfenced hills rolling clear down to the Dead Sea one may have the feeling of 
peering over the brink of another world, and if you read power only in what it 
constructs, in concrete and steel, you might briefly have the impression that 
the hold of the occupation somehow attenuates here. If so, you would be advised 
to recall those encampments now long vanished from view, bereft of a single 
place sign, or exit road.<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One way to describe the 
hills wedged in between Route 317 and the West Bank&#146;s southern border is 
to say that they cover approximately four square kilometers, yet can take as 
long as two hours to traverse.... more.. e-mail<br>

<strong>Fresh olives and the sound of bombs</strong> <br>
Umaymah 
Hewitt, Middle East Monitor (MEMO)&nbsp;8/19/2011<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gaza is under fresh attack from Israel following 
an incident near Eilat in which seven Israelis were killed and 40 injured. 
Although those responsible &quot;crossed the border from Sinai&quot;, the 
Israeli government claims that it was carried out by &quot;terrorists from 
Gaza&quot;. As usual, swift &quot;full force retaliation&quot; took place, 
leaving six Palestinians dead in the first wave early on Friday morning, 19 
August.<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is the disconnected, disaffected 
news I have seen in Britain. Up until a month ago, I would have responded in 
the standard manner on hearing it, with somewhat feeble exclamations of protest 
and a few Facebook and Twitter posts. I would have perhaps even signed a 
petition or two.<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But now I have visited Gaza. I 
have crossed the Rafah border, walked upon the Holy Land in the Holy Month of 
Ramadan, dug my toes into the soft sand, trailed my fingers through the warm 
sea, touched the olive trees, befriended my Palestinian brothers and sisters, 
and left my heart there.<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I knew then, instantly, 
that my entire outlook on the Palestinian issue has changed: it is no longer 
simply a 'situation' faced by the Palestinian people, on my laptop screen, 
safely distant, thousands of miles away. It is now scarily real and deeply 
personal. I've always proclaimed my support for Palestine; but now, I am 
genuinely terrified by the horrific prospect of my friends and their families 
being harmed and killed.<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I find it hard to 
describe the Palestinian girls and young women I met in Gaza. The words 
'strong', 'courageous', 'resilient' just aren't enough. My Gazan sisters are 
inspirational. Their radiant smiles, warm hugs and bright laughter belie the 
staggeringly awful times they've had to endure, and are still going through. 
They are beautiful, in every single sense of the word. more.. e-mail<br>

I was then out on one of my long weekend walks. Muhammad came towards me, 
pointed towards the olive grove and presented me to the long gray dragon that 
was approaching his house. At the time he did not know whether the wall would 
go east of the house and let him belong to Jerusalem with all the practical 
benefits, or if it would go west of the house, and forever shut him out of 
Jerusalem. It was a lottery with a winning ticket and a loosing ticket. Bu he 
could not even pick his own lottery ticket. Some other people decided over his 
future. Then he spoke about the dragon that was approaching, the dead...more<br>

provoking, illuminating, enlightening, informative&hellip;.most importantly 
Fast Times in Palestine highlights the essential humanity of Palestinians and 
their struggle with the constant oppression of Israeli society that surrounds 
all facets of their lives. In the face of overwhelming power, the message that 
underlies this story is the very idea of Palestinian existence. Not just base 
existence, but existence of a culture, a distinct society, that dares to live 
and breathe within the confines of walls, and razor wire, bombs and bullets, 
and any and all daily harassments that few in the western world face. That 
culture is alive and well in spite of it all, and perhaps healthier than many

Frogs and dragonflies live in harmony with all creatures and man. A reddish sun

Bali, like no other in the world reveals the forces of nature. The magic of 
Bali is the night time encounter of the divine in the form of moon, mountain, 
sea and trees with the worshipping faithful. It is the magic of Bali at it's 
highest. As light turns from red to orange to deepest blue, as mountain fades 
into darkness, I think of my Palestine imprisoned in the paranoid face of

<strong>Israeli 
Settler Violence Report: March and April 2011</strong> <br>
Ahmad Jaradat, 
Alternative Information Center&nbsp;6/12/2011<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Israeli settler violence against Palestinians in 
the North and South West Bank increased in March and April 2011. The brutal 
aggressions against lands, homes and residents are part of an obvious 
systematic project to render the life of Palestinian residents virtually 
impossible.<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Settlers announced their &#147;price 
tag&#148; plan after the Israeli army dismantled mobile homes in some West Bank 
outposts and settlements. This &#147;price tag&#148; strategy is carried out 
through land confiscations, physical attacks using stones, guns and knives, the 
uprooting of olive trees and attacks on homes.<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 
most of the settler attacks in March and April 2011, the connection between 
settlers and Israeli soldiers is evident. The army collaborates with the 
violent settler aggression against Palestinian residents; proof of this link 
includes military harassments against Palestinian farmers and residents who are 
trying to defend their villages and lands against settler attacks.<br>
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Both in the northern and southern West Bank, the army 
intervenes to facilitate settler violence, instead of stopping it. Soldiers are 
involved in cruel episodes of violence, arresting Palestinians who denounce 
settler aggressions or even pushing them out of their own lands. Police 
officers and military officials often deny Palestinian complaints against 
settlers: As commander of the Israeli military police, Meir Ohana, admitted 
last month, only 6-9% of complaints by Palestinian residents are taken into 
consideration. The rest are totally ignored, and hundreds of cases of abuse and 
attacks are closed.<br>

<strong>Walking to the Buffer Zone
</strong> <br>
Johnny Barber, CounterPunch&nbsp;6/10/2011<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Inside the Jail of Gaza<br>
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We marched to the buffer zone with about 20 others 
including members of the Beit Hanoun Local Initiative who have been organizing 
non-violent demonstrations for the past three years, as well as several members 
of GYBO (Gaza Youth Break Out). Carrying flags and alternately chanting, 
singing and walking in silence we approached the Israeli border. This is a no 
go zone for Palestinians. Israel has deemed that 300 meters from the wall is a 
buffer zone, so Palestinian farmland is taken away.<br>
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Waving flags and chanting we reached the edge of the 
buffer zone and continued walking. Almost immediately, dust kicked up just 
ahead of us, a warning shot rang out. We stopped, daring to go no further. 
Climbing a small embankment we waved our Palestinian flags and chanted to the

neck, turned, and ran back in the direction we had come. He had been hit with

 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That effectively ended the 
demonstration; we turned and headed back toward the village. I was stunned that 
two dozen people could pose such a threat to Israel that the army would resort 
to using live rounds of ammunition against us. Of course, we were not a 
physical threat, I imagine the Israeli soldiers laughed at us as we turned and 
headed back. But non-violent demonstrations do cause a threat, especially when 
people walk to the wall and demand access to their land, their olive trees, 
their resources, and their homes. Israel has only one method to disperse 
non-violent demonstrators and that is through violent repression.<br>

<strong>Commemorating Naksa: Report on 
Weekend Anti-Occupation Protests</strong> <br>
Dolev Rahat, Alternative

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>When 
demonstrators understood that the fire was aimed directly at their bodies, they 
began to run. The shooting, however, did not stop...</i><br>
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This past weekend&#146;s demonstrations (3-4 June) 
against the Israeli occupation, settlements and apartheid walls were conducted 
in the West Bank villages of Bil&#146;in, Na&#146;alin, Nabi Saleh, al Masara 
and Beit Ummar. In Budrus a demonstration was held against an Israeli quarry 
located on land of Palestinian villages.<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The 
weekly demonstration against the Separation Wall in the Ramallah-area village 
of Bil&#146;in commemorated the 44th anniversary of the Naksa, the beginning of 
Israel&#146;s 1967 occupation of the West Bank, East Jerusalem, Gaza Strip and 
the Syrian Golan. Demonstrators carried two huge maps of Palestine that noted 
the Palestinian land lost in 1948 and 1967. When demonstrators reached the 
Separation Wall, Israeli soldiers shot tear gas and skunk water at them. 
Journalist Haled Manasara was injured in his leg from a tear gas canister. 
However, demonstrators did manage to reach the Wall (which in this area is a 
barbed wire fence) and removed tens of metres of it.<br>
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tear gas canisters resulted in the setting of several 
small fires and burning of numerous olive trees. Soldiers continued shooting 
toward the olive groves with the goal of setting trees on fire, even after the 
demonstration ended and protesters returned to the village.<br>
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the Ramallah-area village of Na&#146;alin the 
weekly demonstration commemorated the second anniversary of the death of Aqel 
Srur, who was shot in the chest with live fire in the village in June 2009. 
This week the military also chose to oppress the Na&#146;alin demonstration 
using live ammunition. -- See also:AlJazeera video: Violence marks 'Naksa' in

<strong>Amidst long hours waiting to pass to Jerusalem
</strong> <br>
Shahd Abusalma, International Solidarity Movement&nbsp;5/25/2011
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Last night, I went to bed at 11 pm, much 
earlier than I&#146;m used to. I forced myself to stay under my blanket. The 
room was very dark and no sound could be heard but the sound of me moving in 
bed continually. I wanted to sleep so that 7 am today would come quickly, but 
all my attempts failed. Daydreaming in darkness conquered my mind. I dreamt 
about my travel to Jerusalem, the smell of its air, the view of its nature, its 
streets, and its people. My excitement to reach it kept me awake and I only 
managed to sleep at 4:30 am, then woke up again an hour and a half later.<br>
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Amidst this chaos and all the people around me who are 
chatting as an attempt to make time pass faster, I&#146;m putting my headphones 
in my ears and listening to Fairoz, trying to live in my own world. I&#146;m 
writing now from Beit Hanoun border or the so called Erez border. I&#146;m 
sitting in a hall among lots of people, many of them patients and traders. 
Everybody has an excuse to go to Jerusalem and waiting to get permission to 
pass. My eyes are confused; one eye on the people around me and another on the 
fences that surround me from all destinations, laughing and sarcastically 
pitying the situation. Isn&#146;t it funny that all of us here are waiting for 
hours to have a pass to go to our capital, Jerusalem? It&#146;s not fair at all 
that I need an excuse to go there!<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now I&#146;ve 
completed two hours of waiting and I don&#146;t know for how much longer 
I&#146;ll have to wait. While I was writing nonstop, an old woman sat next to 
me. Her traditional Palestinian dress lined by red embroidery attracted my 
eyes. The wrinkles of her face looked like she was bearing so many burdens that 
I thought she was older than only 66 years old. &#147;Are you a refugee?&#148; 
she asked. I smiled at her, nodding my head to confirm that. Then she said that 
she is too a refugee. That was the start of a very interesting conversation 
about our lands, which all Palestinian refugees were cleansed from in 1948. She 
was only three years old when her family was expelled from her original 
village, Acre.... more.. e-mail<br>

Post&nbsp;5/23/2011<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>A recent trip to the 
weekly demonstration in Nabi Saleh shed a new light on the IDF and its 
operations.</i><br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For months I have been hearing 
about disproportionate use of force by the army against weekly demonstrations 
in Nabi Saleh &#150; a small pastoral Palestinian village northwest of 
Ramallah. Last week, I watched several YouTube videos filmed by activists in 
the village, providing vivid visual images of the forceful arrests of 
protesters by the army. I was disturbed because all of the clips showed how the 
demonstrations ended; none showed how they began. I was convinced that there 
must have been stone-throwing by the shabab in the village which provoked the 
violent army responses. So I decided I had to see for myself.<br>
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I contacted the Israeli activists who regularly 
participate in the Nabi Saleh demonstrations, I was warned that it was 
dangerous and that there was no way to know in advance when we would get home. 
They also warned that there was a high possibility we would be arrested. I am 
55 years old, and have been demonstrating since the age of 12. I have been in 
dangerous situations before, and was prepared for another one.<br>
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ON FRIDAY morning I was picked up from French Hill at 
10:30. We drove on 443 until the Shilat junction, and turned toward the West 
Bank. We drove off the beaten settlers&#146; track through the Palestinian 
villages in the area. We then turned off the road and parked in an olive grove. 
From there, we began a trek of about an hour through the hills, finally 
arriving, after a steep climb, at the edge of the village. Every Friday morning 
the army seals off the area and prevents entry and exit for all. The 500 
residents of Nabi Saleh, all from the Tamimi family, are demonstrating against 
the continuous encroachment of the Helamish settlement on their land. Since 
2009, Nabi Saleh has been demonstrating every Friday. more.. e-mail<br>

<strong>Do you 
see that land? That land is mine and I cannot go there</strong> <br>

International Solidarity Movement&nbsp;5/14/2011<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On May 8, 9, and 10th the farmers of 
Khuza&#146;a harvested their wheat. Khuza&#146;a is a village near the Israeli 
border in the southern Gaza Strip. For three days they visited the fields, 
starting very early in the morning and picking the fruits of their land. For 
three days the Israeli occupation forces fired from their automated turret 
while the farmers continued to harvest their grain. However, they did not allow 
the Israeli Occupation Force to prevent them from going to their land.<br>
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The area where the farmers, along with three 
international ISM activists and five Palestinian activists traveled to, is 
about 450 meters from the border. Before the second intifada melons were grown 
there, along with other fruit trees and olive trees. &#147;We came here to do 
barbecue, party and relax&#133; the Israeli jeeps used to pass in the distance 
but did not bother us, they used to leave us in peace.&#148; Ahmed said. Today 
the trees have been uprooted, the plants destroyed. The only thing that can be 
grown, because it does not require constant attention, is wheat. But the wheat 
needs several hours to be collected, and snipers have fun terrorizing the 
farmers during those hours.<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On May 8th in 
addition to the activists there were eight farmers in the fields, mostly women, 
but also a child of 13 years and a girl of seven, all brothers and sisters of 
the AnNajjar family which resides in Khuza&#146;a. They were on 10 dunams of 
their land, collecting the golden-yellow wheat in bundles and they thought that 
the presence of activists (foreign and not) could protect them at work, and 
decided to go farther than usual to collect plants to feed their animals. Where 
the wheat fields end the land is crossed by sand dunes caused by Israeli 
bulldozers; here grows thorn bushes and small trees that seem dry, but are a 
good food for donkeys and sheep. A man bends down to pull up some plants, 
extends his arm and points his finger at a dune a few tens of meters away, 
&#147;You see that land? That land is mine and I can not go there.&#148; -- See

Catrina 
Stewart, The Independent&nbsp;4/30/2011<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>
Catrina Stewart visits an abandoned settlement, frozen in time 63 years ago, 
that may soon become a luxury housing development.</i><br>
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Walking through the abandoned Palestinian village of 
Lifta, Yacoub Odeh is transported back to a time more than 63 years ago when as 
a child he would play in these streets before his carefree existence came to an 
abrupt end.<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As he points out the old mosque and 
olive press, names come tumbling back, events, memories &#150; a life before 
1948, the fateful year that hundreds of thousands of Palestinians fled their 
ancestral homes during Israel's war of independence, most of them never to 
return.<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All that remains of this once-prosperous 
village are the shells of dozens of houses dotted throughout the valley, their 
outer walls largely intact but now overgrown with wildflowers and weeds.<br>
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How much longer the village will remain in this state 
is anyone's guess. It is at the centre of a wrangle over whether it should be 
preserved in its current state as a reminder of the Palestinian dispossession 
or redeveloped into luxury housing. The Israel Land Administration, now the 
legal owner of the land, is marketing plots to developers to construct an 
upscale neighbourhood based on the buildings that already exist.<br>
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;They [the Jews] did not destroy Lifta in time of 
war, so they should not destroy it when Israel is talking about peace,&quot; 
says Mr Odeh, a Palestinian in his early 70s who spent his early childhood 
there. -- See also:Call to Save the History, Culture and Heritage of Lifta

Where are those who would survey the scrubgrass And the pales horse And the 
winter moon And the olive trees Planted a thousand new suns ago By those who 
are no longer But whose sweat lingers in the soil Are there no Israeli poets? 
Are they afraid? Of looking inward On a barren moonlit landscape While

<strong>Murdering Babies is 'Permissible' When 
They&#146;re Palestinian</strong> <br>
Alison Weir, Counterpunch, 
Intifada-Palestine&nbsp;3/18/2011<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; US media 
have been widely and repeatedly reporting on the awful March 11 murder of three 
small Israeli children and their parents. While no one yet knows who committed 
this act, reports presume that the murderers were Palestinian, and for this 
reason the incident is receiving major attention. Various heads of state, 
including President Obama, have condemned it.<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If 
it turns out that the murderer or murderers were Israeli, as some previously 
presumed &#147;terrorists&#148; have turned out to be, or a foreign worker who 
had previously threatened the family over unpaid wages, as some reports from 
the area suggest, it is likely that coverage of the incident will quickly 
vanish from U.S. headlines.<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For now, however, 
American news reports continue to provide excruciating details about the 
atrocity. Given the amount of reportage, it is surprising how much significant 
information is omitted.<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For example, none of 
these reports mention that the location of the murders, Itamar (near Nablus), 
is an illegal Jewish-only settlement on stolen Palestinian land in the midst of 
refugees whom Israel pushed off their ancestral land through massacres and 
ruthless military actions.<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor do reports mention 
the frequency with which Israeli settlers beat, occasionally torture, and 
sometimes murder Palestinians of all ages, burn their crops, and hack down 
their groves of olive trees, the livelihood of many Palestinian villagers; 
hundreds, at least, of these trees, have been destroyed by rampaging Israeli 
settlers. -- See also:Source more.. e-mail<br>

<strong>Call to Save the History, Culture and Heritage of Lifta Village</strong>
<br>Sons of Lifta Society, Alternative Information Center&nbsp;3/14/2011<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Few Palestinian villages capture the tragedy of 
1948 like Lifta. Refugees from Lifta appeal to the international community to 
halt the final destruction of their village; Israel should not be allowed to 
continue justifying its annexation practices and denial of Palestinian rights 
in order to build luxury apartments exclusively for Jews.<br>
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Background<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Few villages 
capture the tragedy of the Nakba (the 1948 dispossession of the Palestinian 
people) quite like Lifta. Situated on the north-west edge of Jerusalem, the 
village is divided by the 1949 Armistice green line, which leaves part of it in 
West Jerusalem and part in East Jerusalem. The village has been continuously 
inhabited for well over 2,000 years, long before the establishment of the state 
of Israel. Official records indicate that in 1931, the number of houses stood 
at 410, most of which were built by Lifta's Palestinian residents using the 
famous Jerusalem stone from nearby quarries. During the 1940s and leading up to 
the end of the British Mandate in Palestine in 1948, Lifta expanded markedly 
eastward and northward, linking with the buildings of the Rumayma neighbourhood 
just west of Jerusalem. Its economic ties with Jerusalem became strong as 
nearly half of Lifta's cultivated land was planted with cereal, wheat, barley, 
olives and various fruits. As the village expanded, the villagers built new 
stores, established a social club and opened two coffee houses. But they also 
took care to preserve the older sites, both sacred and secular.<br>
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During the 1948 war, one of the goals of the Jewish 
armed forces was securing the western exit of the city. In order to achieve 
this the Israeli forces launched a series of military and militia attacks on 
the village including the burning of the Mukhtar&#146;s (head of the village) 
house on the 11th of January 1948, and two days later 20 houses close to the 
entry of the city (KhalitTarha) were blown up.... -- See also:Help the campaign

Declaration of Independence</strong><br>
Palestine Monitor: 14 Mar 2011 - 
Renouncing violence and terrorism, recognizing Israel, accepting United Nations 
Resolutions 242 and 338 and negotiations leading to a two-state solution, 
Mahmoud Darwish's crafted Declaration of Independence is a foundational 
document for the Palestinian struggle for freedom and independence. From it's 
release in 1988 in Algiers until today, it's lessons continue to be relevant. 
Preamble In the name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful, Palestine, the 
land of the three monotheistic faiths, is where the Palestinian Arab people was 
born, on which it grew, developed and excelled. Thus the Palestinian Arab 
people ensured for itself an everlasting union between itself, its land, and 
its history. Resolute throughout that history, the Palestinian Arab people 
forged its national identity, rising even to unimagined levels in its defense, 
as invasion, the design of others, and the appeal special to Palestine's 
ancient and luminous place on the eminence where powers and civilizations are 
joined. All...more<br>
<strong>Recognizing Palestine: Estonia's Iceland Moment

Palestine Chronicle: 13 Mar 2011 - By Oliver Loode Estonia will 
mark the 20th anniversary of the restoration of its independence in August of

the European Capital of Culture to Tallinn and the euro to Estonia. It will 
also be an occasion for numerous speeches and newspaper articles on how our 
independence was won back, whether this is &quot;the Estonia that we 
wanted,&quot; and what it means for Estonia to be an independent country in a 
globalized world. To a large extent, the anniversary will be a rather 
Esto-centric, self-congratulatory affair. I, however, offer a proposal to use 
it for something even more meaningful &ndash; as an opportunity to show

it was in 1991 &ndash; by recognizing the independence of Palestine. There are

the gentle slopes of cypress-covered hills near the West Bank city of Hebron is 
an anomaly, a stinking garbage dump that is workplace and home to dozens of men 
and boys.<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The quiet that hangs over neighboring 
olive groves, in the far south of the West Bank, is broken here by the shouts 
of workers, many of them children, and the grinding of a bulldozer covering the 
picked-over trash with sand and dirt.<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Overhead 
the sky is clear and the sun beats down, heating up the detritus of modern life 
-- vegetable scraps, washing liquid bottles, old clothes, cans with dregs of 
soda in them.<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The smell produced is overpowering 
at times, a sickly-sweet stench of rotting organic matter and chemical 
effluvia, which sticks to clothes and hair despite the light breezes that sweep 
over the hilltop.<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the far end of the hill, 
created entirely from layers of garbage ploughed over with sand, are makeshift 
residences -- planks of wood with tarpaulin or rubbish bags strapped over them 
to provide shelter.<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For many of those working 
here, these shacks act as their home during the week, a place they can sleep at 
night rather than going back to the village of Yatta. And it also means they 
are on hand to sort out any rubbish that comes in after dark.<br>
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is unpleasant, tiring work, but is a rare source of 
income in the West Bank, where unemployment stands around 15.2 percent. more..

<strong>Palestine Papers under the 
spotlight</strong> <br>
Samira Quraishy, Middle East Monitor 
(MEMO)&nbsp;2/25/2011<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A seminar planned to 
put the &quot;Palestine Papers under the spotlight&quot; has been held in the 
Senate House of the University of London. Organised by the Middle East Monitor 
(MEMO) in conjunction with the Federation of Students Islamic Societies 
(FOSIS), the event sought to draw attention back to the important documents 
leaked to and published by Al Jazeera and the Guardian newspaper; the 
publication of the papers was overshadowed by the turbulent political situation 
in Egypt and elsewhere across the Middle East.<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Under the capable chairmanship of lawyer and Liberal Democrat peer, Lord Andrew 
Phillips, the seminar was divided into two sessions: the first was an 
opportunity for political analysts and Middle East experts to share their 
insights and thoughts on the Palestine Papers, as the leaked documents are now 
called; former CIA analyst and author Kathleen Christison, Britain's former 
ambassador to Iran Sir Richard Dalton and Director and Co-Founder of the 
community empowerment charity Forward Thinking, Oliver McTernan, led the way. 
In the second session, Al Jazeera Executive Producer and author Clayton Swisher 
was joined by former BBC Middle East correspondent Tim Llewellyn. Mr. Swisher 
is head of the Transparency Unit at Al Jazeera which published the papers. The 
evening ended with a panel of the speakers taking questions from the audience 
of more than 200 people.<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Opening the seminar, 
Lord Phillips asked the audience to stand for a minute's silence in solidarity 
with those who were struggling for their rights across the Middle East, before 
introducing the Director of MEMO, Dr. Daud Abdullah, who provided a brief 
insight into the significance of the Palestine Papers. The documents, he said, 
exposed the main players in the Israel-Palestine peace process negotiations, 
primarily the state of Israel, the Palestinian Authority and the United States; 
the British government and intelligence services, the French and other Western 
states were also mentioned in the papers.... more.. e-mail<br>

</i><br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A few weeks ago I was in al-Nabi Salih, a 
Palestinian village northwest of Ramallah in the occupied West Bank. It 
wasn&#146;t so easy to get there; the Israeli army had closed off the area on 
every side, and we literally had to crawl through the olive groves, just 
beneath one of the army&#146;s roadblocks, before we managed to reach the 
village. Al-Nabi Salih is a troubled place. The large Israeli settlement of 
Halamish nearby has taken over nearly half of the village lands, including a 
precious freshwater spring. Most Fridays there are dramatic confrontations 
between the soldiers and the villagers protesting this land grab and the other 
difficulties of life under occupation.<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet the 
first thing I saw in al-Nabi Salih was a huge sign in Arabic and English: 
&#147;We Believe in Non-Violence. Do You?&#148; It was World Peace Day, and 
speaker after speaker reaffirmed a commitment to peace and to nonviolent 
resistance to the occupation. Particularly eloquent was Ali Abu Awwad, a young 
activist who runs a new organization, the Palestinian Movement for Non-Violent 
Resistance, with its offices in Bethlehem and growing influence throughout the 
occupied territories. &#147;Peace itself is the way to peace,&#148; he said, 
&#147;and there is no peace without freedom.&#148;1<br>
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All of this is, in some ways, rather new in Palestine,

Israeli Settlers Violence Report: November, December 2010</strong> <br>
Ahmad 
Jaradat, Alternative Information Center&nbsp;1/18/2011<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Alternative Information Center monitored and 
recorded Israeli settler attacks and violations during the final two months of 
2010.<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Introduction<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
As will be demonstrated, settler attacks continued during this period and were 
concentrated in the north of the West Bank, especially in the Nablus District. 
Trees were the most common target, with burnings and land confiscations, 
especially land close to settlements, which serve the aim of expanding 
settlements and providing strategic points for attacks on Palestinian residents 
traveling by road.<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Several of the attacks were 
done with full cooperation of the Israeli army and in plain sight of soldiers, 
who did nothing to prevent the settlers from attacking and burning trees.<br>
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hebron and South West Bank Region<br>
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At midday on 11 November, settlers from the Takoa 
settlement to the southeast of Bethlehem threw stones at the students of the 
girls school in the Tako&#146;a village. Students from the school were engaged 
in a demonstration against the soldiers who had stopped in front of the school, 
which is located near the main road. Settlers who were travelling on the road 
stopped their cars and threw stones at the students.<br>
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On 11 November, settlers from the Beitar Illit 
settlement, west of the Bethlehem District, opened the pipes of the 
settlement&#146;s sewage onto the land of the Hosan village to the east of the

<strong>Gaza doctor 
Izzeldin Abuelaish: 'We saved lives,' I told the children. 'Your sisters&rsquo; 
blood wasn&rsquo;t wasted&rsquo;&rsquo;</strong> <br>
Rachel Cooke, The 
Observer, The Guardian&nbsp;1/16/2011<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Two 
years ago, Israeli shells fell on Dr Abuelaish's family home in Gaza, killing 
three of his young daughters and their cousin. The horror was caught live on 
Israeli TV when the doctor phoned his broadcaster friend. Amazingly, the loss 
did not embitter Izzeldin Abuelaish. Instead he decided his girls' deaths must 
not be in vain &#150; and slowly he has turned his family tragedy into a force 
for peace</i><br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On 12 December 2008, Izzeldin 
Abuelaish, a doctor from Gaza, took his six daughters and two sons on a day 
out. The family rose early, packed a picnic and, at 7am, climbed into his old 
Subaru and headed out. Gaza is not big &#150; just 25 miles long, and nine 
miles across at its widest &#150; but the situation being what it is, it can 
take time to move around and Abuelaish was determined that they make the most 
of the hours ahead. Twelve weeks earlier, Nadia, his wife of 21 years, had died 
suddenly of leukaemia and ever since, every day had dawned black. It was his 
intention, that sunny winter morning, to shine a little light on them, to give 
his brood some respite, however brief, from their grief.<br>
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Their first stop was a surprise. Unbeknown to his 
family, Abuelaish had recently bought a small olive grove, about an acre in 
size. Separated from the urban sprawl by a 10ft-high fence, it was &quot;a 
utopia, a little piece of Shangri-La&quot;. The smaller ones, delighted to 
discover this new place, ran among the olive, fig and apricot trees, before 
finally settling down to eat their falafel sandwiches beneath a bower of vines. 
As they did so, the family talked. Abuelaish had been offered a job in Toronto, 
Canada, and he wanted to know how the children, who had never known anywhere 
other than Gaza, would feel about this. (Good, as it turned out. &quot;I want 
to fly, daddy,&quot; said his daughter, Aya.) The family discussion over, they 
headed to the beach, where the children dashed over the dunes, chased the surf, 
and wrote their names in the sand. Abuelaish cherished their laughter, the way 
they mimicked and teased one another. For the first time in many days, his 
spirits lifted. &quot;We are getting there,&quot; he remembers thinking. 
&quot;They will be okay. Together, we can do this.&quot; more.. e-mail<br>

<strong>The day after Zionism</strong> <br>
Hannah Mermelstein, Ma&rsquo;an 
News Agency&nbsp;1/16/2011<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As we trudge 
through the terraced land, ducking under branches of olive trees and trying to 
avoid prickly bushes, I think about landscape, consciousness, and memory.<br>
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are walking through the land because Israeli 
soldiers are blocking the road ahead. They are blocking the road ahead so as 
not to allow people to arrive in the Palestinian village of Bil&#146;in. We are 
going to Bil&#146;in in order to protest the confiscation of the village&#146;s 
land for settlement and wall construction.<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At 
Bil'in's demonstration a week earlier, 36-year-old Jawaher Abu Rahmah inhaled a 
lethal dose of tear gas. Her brother Bassem was shot and killed by an Israeli 
soldier at a protest in the village just under two years ago.<br>
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So we traipse through the olive groves, only slightly 
out of view of the soldiers on the road, and a line by Palestinian poet Mahmoud 
Darwish comes to mind: &quot;If the olive trees knew the hands that planted 
them, their oil would become tears.&quot;<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Bil&#146;in has become a battleground, the surrounding landscape a stage for a 
risky game of cat and mouse. What kind of consciousness does the land have? 
What would it say if it could? The wall is often described as a scar through 
Palestine, but right now it is more of a fresh wound. When the wall falls, will 
the scar left be permanent?<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two days before this 
protest, our group wakes up at the Yafa Cultural Center in Balata refugee camp, 
Nablus. We eat breakfast, thank our hosts, and get in a bus with the right 
color license plate, driven by a driver with the right color ID card, and head 
towards the city of Yafa. more.. e-mail<br>

Palestine Monitor: 4 Jan 2011 - 
Jawahur Abu Rahmah died on the first day of 2011 after suffering intense 
teargas inhalation at the end of year anti-wall protest in Bil'in. Her death 
leaves a hole in her family that will be hard to fill. The Abu Rahmahs have 
suffered much under the occupation. They were drawn into the fight permanently 
when in 2004 their land was annexed by Israel following the construction of the 
apartheid wall. They were cut off from their olive trees and left without a 
source of income. Since then, their objections to this injustice have been met 
with terrifying force. In 2008, brother Ashraf was arrested, blindfolded and 
shot in the leg. The attack was captured on film and uploaded to the internet.

<strong>Christmas Story - 
Mary and Joseph in Palestine 2010</strong> <br>
James Petras, &nbsp;12/12/2010
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>How would Mary and Joseph, two Jews from 
Nazareth, have fared in the context of present-day Palestine where the Romans 
have been replaced by Jewish occupiers? A caustic exercise in realistic 
imagination offered by James Petras.</i><br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Times 
were tough for Joseph and Mary. The real estate bubble crashed. Unemployment 
soared among construction workers. There was no work, not even for a skilled 
carpenter.<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The settlements were still being 
built, financed mostly by Jewish money from America, contributions from Wall 
Street speculators and owners of gambling dens.<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&#147;Good thing&#148;, Joseph thought, &#147;we have a few sheep and olive 
trees and Mary keeps some chickens. But Joseph worried, &#147;cheese and olives 
are not enough to feed a growing boy. Mary is due to deliver our son any 
day&#148;. His dreams foretold of a sturdy son working alongside of 
him&#133;multiplying loaves and fish.<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The 
settlers looked down on Joseph. He rarely attended shul, and on the high 
holidays, he would show up late to avoid the tithe. Their simple cottage was 
located in a nearby ravine with water from a stream, which flowed year round. 
It was choice real estate for any settlement expansion. So when Joseph fell 
behind on his property tax, the settlers took over their home, forcibly evicted 
Joseph and Mary and offered them a one-way bus ticket to Jerusalem.<br>
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Joseph, born and raised in the arid hills, fought back 
and bloodied not a few settlers with his labor-hardened fists. But in the end 
he sat, battered on their bridal bed under the olive tree, in black despair.

<strong>Insisting on humanity</strong> <br>

Ramzy Baroud, Ma&rsquo;an News Agency&nbsp;12/18/2010<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When a copy of William A. Cook&#146;s latest 
book, The Plight of the Palestinians arrived in my mailbox, I initially felt a 
little worried. The volume, featuring the work of over 30 accomplished writers, 
is the most articulate treatise on the collective victimization of Palestinians 
to date. From Cook&#146;s own introduction, &#145;The Untold Story of the 
Zionist Intent to Turn Palestine into a Jewish State&#146; to Francis 
Boyle&#146;s summation of &#145;Israel&#146;s Crimes against the 
Palestinians&#146;, it takes the reader through an exhaustive journey, charting 
the course of Palestinian history prior to and since the Nakba, the Catastrophe 
of 1947-48.<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Still, I feared that something might 
be missing in this noble and monumental undertaking: Palestinian people&#146;s 
own responses to the cruelties they&#146;ve suffered. Would Palestinians be 
presented yet again as merely poster-child victims, eager for handouts?<br>
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The photograph on the cover was telling: a kindly old 
man with a white beard, who could have been any Palestinian or Middle-Eastern 
grandpa, is lovingly touching the hair of a toddler. The two are crouching 
before a small, stained tent. The Nakba was still recent, and the two 
Palestinians, separated by two generations appear tired and haggard as they are 
caught in this hopeless scene. Yet, somehow the grandfather insists on 
preserving his right to love his grandson. This insistence on one&#146;s 
humanity has been the key strength which has allowed the Palestinian people to 
preserve their struggle and resistance before the wicked arm of occupation and 
oppression for nearly 63 years.<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do most academics 
know this? Do they truly comprehend what it is that makes an old man from a 
West Bank village face the brutality of Jewish settlers, year after year, as he 
returns to harvest his few remaining olive trees? Or a Palestinian woman from 
Gaza who keeps coming back to hold a vigil before the Red Cross office with a

<strong>Israeli Settlers&#146; 
Violence Report &#150; September and October 2010</strong> <br>
Ahmad Jaradat, 
Alicia Isani, AIC, Alternative Information Center&nbsp;11/18/2010<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Introduction<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The 
following report highlights a drastic change in Israeli settler attacks against 
Palestinians, not only because of the increasing number of aggressions but also 
because of the evolution of the violence itself.<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
In September and October 2009, only a few aggressions against Palestinian 
farmers &#150; related to harvest, land and farming equipment &#150; were 
reported. Yet approximately 22 incidents of this kind were reported this year 
for the same period. Even if this time of year is particularly violent in the 
West Bank due to the olive harvesting season, other notable changes can be 
observed this year.<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One explanation for the 
violent evolution that took place over the past two months is the end of 
Israel&#146;s ten month partial settlement freeze on 26 September 2010. On 26 
September, settlers and their supporters publicly celebrated the beginning of a 
new wave of illegal construction in the West Bank, a celebration they had been 
preparing since the beginning of September. The month of October was thus 
particularly characterized by a new wave of violence, land grabbing and 
destruction due to the construction of new outposts and the expansion of 
existing settlements. This decision &#150; along with the inability of 
international leaders to force Israel to apply a new settlement freeze so that 
negotiations could continue &#150; was largely perceived by the settlers and 
their leaders as recognition of their presence in the West Bank and as 
encouragement to go ahead with their colonization. According to a report 
written by the Israeli organization Peace Now, 1,126 construction sites have 
been opened in the West Bank since the end of the settlement freeze. more..

Gil Zohar, Common Ground News Service&nbsp;11/25/2010<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; JERUSALEM - Driving east from Jerusalem on the 
winding Jordanian-built road that once led down from the Mount of Olives to the 
Dead Sea, one passes through a series of Arab suburbs and soon comes to a dead 
end in front of the grotesque West Bank barrier.<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Called Geder ha-Hafrada (separation fence) in Hebrew and jidar al-fasl 
al-&#145;unsuri (Apartheid wall) in Arabic, the insurmountable (if still 
incomplete) barrier has no doubt contributed to a reduction in terror and car 
theft. However, my objection to it is more existential: like some of those in 
West Berlin who spray-painted their protest for freedom on the Bundesrepublik 
side of die Mauer even as armed GDR guards used deadly force to prevent anyone 
from approaching the Wall&#146;s eastern side, I believe all walls must fall.
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is a metaphor that has repeated itself from 
Joshua&#146;s encircling of Jericho, to the Berlin Wall and its remaining East 
Side gallery, to Garth Hewitt&#146;s ballad: &#147;They&#146;ve Cancelled 
Christmas in Bethlehem&#148; - about the stranglehold the wall has placed on 
both day-to-day life and religious pilgrimage in the place where Jesus the 
Prince of Peace was born 2,000 years ago.<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The 
world today is caught between two conflicting ideologies: The growing trend of 
some democratic countries to join in unions with open borders, joint legal 
systems, and a common currency, of which the European Union - notwithstanding 
its problems - is a great success. Then, there is the trend of other countries 
- many repressive and undemocratic - to defend their borders with minefields 
and walls. Like John Lennon, I prefer the first vision - of a growing global 
union without barriers. Imagine that. more.. e-mail<br>

2010 - By Philip Giraldi President Barack Obama's speech in Indonesia in which

pathetic performances by an American president in recent years but for the fact 
that there have been so many awful performances to choose from. The 
president&rsquo;s grammar and syntax were perfect and the speech was cleverly 
crafted, exactly what we have come to expect. It was replete with carefully 
designed pauses, Indonesian words and phrases, and some self deprecating humor, 
but it was characteristically bloodless and completely tone deaf. One almost 
longed to see Bill Clinton choking up and shedding a tear or two. Obama&rsquo;s 
spin team made a heroic effort to turn a sow&rsquo;s ear into a silk purse.

 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When was the last 
time you thought about death?<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Was there a time 
when you felt you were so close to losing your own life? Have you ever 
experienced that scary feeling-except maybe in the movie theatres? &#133;have 
you ever felt like not actually living, you&#146;re still breathing &#133; but 
you&#146;re living as dead?<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most people live 
their lives never thinking about nor contemplating death. It is human nature. 
We were born to live and think about how to best enjoy our life while we are 
still alive. It is in our genes of survival. Something inside us drive us away 
not from death but from pondering at death. Maybe because death is the only 
concrete and dreadful fact we are sure of. But in some places and with some 
people death sometimes can be seen as their shadow on the ground.<br>
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When you can&#146;t eat, drink, move freely, watch TV, 
have access to internet, have a decent job and home and send your kids to 
schools then DEATH could be a liberating thought.<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&#133;And when the world is celebrating the rescue of 33 Chilean miners trapped 
underground- whom we all are glad to see brought back to life again- but at the 
same time the world is playing deaf and blind to the 1.5 million Gazans- 
virtually buried above ground and besieged like animals- then something is 
terribly wrong with the morality of the international community.<br>
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gaza, this narrow strip of land - the aching remnant 
of Palestine - where the orange and olive trees have been growing for hundreds 
of years has lately turned into death fields and a hunting ground for the 
people who planted and watered those evergreen trees generation after

<strong>Civil resistance to bring 
down the Walls</strong> <br>
Ayed Morrar, Huffington Post, International 
Solidarity Movement&nbsp;11/1/2010<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Budrus, a 
documentary film now debuting across the US, tells the story of a successful 
protest campaign by unarmed Palestinian civilians against Israel&#146;s 
military occupation in my small West Bank village. Our struggle&#146;s success 
and the consequent expansion of civil resistance to other West Bank communities 
may provide hope to viewers desperate for positive news from the Middle East, 
but today an Israeli crackdown on unarmed Palestinian protesters is threatening 
this growing movement. For our movement to thrive and serve as a true 
alternative to violence, we need Americans&#146; to demand that Israel, a close 
US ally, end this repression.<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Budrus depicts our 
ten month campaign of protest marches in 2003-2004, which included 
participation by men, women and children, and by representatives from all 
Palestinian political factions, along with Israeli and international activists, 
to resist the construction of Israel&#146;s Separation Barrier on our lands. 
Young women, led by my 15-year-old daughter Iltezam, ran past armed Israeli 
soldiers and jumped In front of the bulldozers that were uprooting our ancient 
olive trees. The soldiers regularly met us with clubs, rubber-coated bullets, 
curfews, arrests and even live ammunition. But we won in the end. The Israeli 
military rerouted the barrier in Budrus, allowing us access to almost all of 
our land.<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The film ends with Palestinian and 
Israeli activists heading to the neighboring village of Ni&#146;ilin where the 
struggle to save Palestinian land continues today. But following Budrus&#146;s 
success and faced by a growing numbers of civilians protesting the confiscation 
of their lands, Israel has responded with military might, attempting to quell 
this new movement. Twenty Palestinians have since been killed during unarmed 
demonstrations against the construction of the Separation Barrier.<br>
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Ni&#146;ilin, in the dark of night, Israeli 
soldiers have staged hundreds of military raids and arrests of civilians from 
the village; hundreds more were injured &#151; forty by live ammunition, and 
five, including a ten year old, were shot dead. Today, a horrid 25 foot 
concrete wall stands in Ni&#146;ilin, behind which lie 620 acres of village 
lands taken for the expansion of illegal Israeli settlements. -- See also:Source

<strong>Israeli Settlers' Terror</strong><br>
Palestine 
Chronicle: 1 Nov 2010 - By Dr. Elias Akleh Palestinians in the Israeli occupied

destruction of all types of properties, burning civilian structures, crops and 
trees, shooting livestock, poisoning wells, and theft of crops and cutting

bathhouses, and antique stores have long-established their place in the heart

witnessed the attack. &quot;He tried to protect his family, but it bit him and

<strong>On the boat to Gaza</strong> <br>

Glyn Secker, Ma&rsquo;an News Agency&nbsp;10/1/2010<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i> The following is an excerpt from the written 
testimony of Glyn Secker, captain of the Irene, the latest boat to attempt the 
breaking of Israel's blockade of the Gaza Strip.</i><br>
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The weather was still very kind to us and we made 
better progress than expected. Not wanting to time the encounter with the 
Israeli navy in the dark we slowed down and when the morning had warmed up I 
suggested that a good way to de-stress would be to stop the boat and for us all 
take a swim in the sparkling deep blue water.<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We 
put out a long line with a fender on the end and in we all plunged &#150; a 
swim to remember. Reuvan, our 82-year-old holocaust survivor, was amazing, 
confidently swimming away from the boat and me trying to keep him within reach 
of the safety line! I think I was the only one who had any breakfast &#150; 
home made muesli (wonderful almond nuts).<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And 
then finally after all these days and weeks of anticipation we identified a 
frigate on the horizon. It shadowed us for some considerable time, keeping on 
our port side about five miles off. Then we saw a number of smaller craft lined 
up and realized that the encounter was approaching. We rehearsed our strategies 
and waited, with adrenalin levels slowly rising. Shortly there came a call on 
Ch 16 over the VHF from the frigate asking us our intentions and the flag of 
the boat. I informed them that we were heading for Gaza port, that we were in 
international waters and had no intention of entering Israeli waters. They 
replied that Gaza was within a prohibited area and that we should change our 
course.<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I responded by stating that that did not 
accord with international law, that we were unarmed, had no materials which 
could be put to military use, that we carried a consignment of aid for Gaza and 
that we expected safe passage. They then warned us that they would intercept 
us, that this could be dangerous for the crew and damaging for the boat. more..

<strong>Why I support the Olympia Co-op boycott</strong> 
<br>Rabbi Lynn Gottlieb, Mondowiess, Israeli Occupation Archive&nbsp;8/4/2010
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dear friends,<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
The Olympia Food Co-op boycott of Israeli products (except for fair trade olive 
oil) has generated much controversy and emotion. I do pray for healing and 
understanding among those who support and those who oppose such a boycott in 
the community of Olympia, Washington and around the world. All of us must stand 
together and mourn the loss of life generated by this conflict. May their 
memories be a blessing.<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Food Co-op and many 
concerned citizens around the world have asked the question: How do we 
transform the Israeli-Palestinian conflict through the use of nonviolence? What 
is meaningful action?<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While negotiations, 
lobbying and dialogue occur, those who have been directly impacted by 
occupation, the Palestinians, have called upon the world to engage in 
meaningful nonviolent action to apply pressure upon Israel so that Israel 
cannot conduct the business of occupation as usual. Have we all not seen and 
read about life in Palestine under occupation? The Goldstone report, 
B&#146;tselem, Gisha and many other organizations and individuals have 
documented the systematic violation of Palestinian human rights in the past 
several years. How do we both construct peace and engage in non-cooperation 
with policies that systematically violate human rights on a daily basis?<br>
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Boycott is a time honored method which was the 
catalyst that ended legal segregation in the United States. Boycott is the 
primary tool of those engaged in nonviolent resistance to systematic injustice. 
Boycott targets unjust policies. It is not about &#145;the right to 
exist&#146;; Everyone has the right to &#145;exist&#146;.... -- See also:Source

Neve Gordon, Redress&nbsp;7/29/2010
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Neve Gordon recounts his experience of 
visiting the Israeli Arab village of Al-Arakib moments after it had been razed 
to the ground by the Israeli authorities, in the latest example of ethnic 
cleansing in the Negev desert.</i><br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A menacing 
convoy of bulldozers was heading back to Be&rsquo;er Sheva as I drove towards 
al-Arakib, a Bedouin village located not more than 10 minutes from the city. 
Once I entered the dirt road leading to the village I saw scores of vans with 
heavily armed policemen getting ready to leave. Their mission, it seems, had 
been accomplished.<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The signs of destruction were 
immediately evident. I first noticed the chickens and geese running loose near 
a bulldozed house, and then saw another house and then another one, all of them 
in rubble. A few children were trying to find a shaded spot to hide from the 
scorching desert sun, while behind them a stream of black smoke rose from the 
burning hay. The sheep, goats and the cattle were nowhere to be seen &#150; 
perhaps because the police had confiscated them. &#147;A whole village 
comprising between 40 and 45 houses had been completely razed in less than 
three hours.&#148;<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Scores of Bedouin men were 
standing on a yellow hill, sharing their experiences from the early morning 
hours, while all around them uprooted olive trees lay on the ground. A whole 
village comprising between 40 and 45 houses had been completely razed in less 
than three hours.<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I suddenly experienced deja vu: 
an image of myself walking in the rubbles of a destroyed village somewhere on 
the outskirts of the Lebanese city of Sidon emerged. It was over 25 years ago, 
during my service in the Israeli paratroopers. But in Lebanon the residents had 
all fled long before my platoon came, and we simply walked in the debris.... --

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Around 300 Bedouins living in Israel&#146;s 
Negev desert have been made homeless after police raided their village and 
razed their homes.<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Israeli activists said 1,500 
police arrived in Al-Arakib village at dawn.<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They 
destroyed 30 to 40 makeshift homes and uprooted hundreds of olive trees 
belonging to the villagers, they said.<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Police 
spokesman Mickey Rosenfeld said the homes had been &#147;illegally built&#148; 
and were destroyed in line with a court ruling issued 11 years ago.<br>
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#147;Several hundred people were taken back to the

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Robin Yassin-Kassab: You did your national service in

kidnappings and bannings discouraged you?<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; David 
Hirst: Yes, I was one of the last generation of British 18-year-olds obliged to 
do two years of military service. Politically speaking, it had virtually no 
effect on me; I was an immature youth from a thoroughly apolitical middle class 
background, and knew next to nothing about international affairs, and hardly 
knew, for example, the difference between Arabs and Israelis. But -- unusually 
for a mere private soldier -- I sought and secured permission to use a 
fortnight&rsquo;s leave to travel round Syria, Iraq, Jordan and Lebanon. I 
enjoyed the experience. After three years at Oxford, I could not think of a 
career to embark on. Remembering the American University of Beirut, I wrote and 
asked them if there were any kind of introductory course about the Middle East 
that I could follow there. There was. With a vague idea of staying there for a 
couple of years or so, I found myself drifting into journalism, and, taking to 
it, I ended up staying fifty.<br>

<strong>The black kites of Palestine</strong> <br>
Lynn Jones, Ma&#146;an News 
Agency&nbsp;7/8/2010<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most kids love kites. 
There&#146;s just something about those colorful swooping colors, long, 
trailing ribbons, and the sensation of controlling a thing that can soar high 
above it all.<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The kids here in the West Bank love 
their kites too, just as much as any other child in the world. I watch them 
sometimes, holding the string, eyes trained aloft, an open-mouthed smile 
plastered on their sun-darkened faces.<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like all 
kids, their imaginations take them up with those kites, and I know that while 
they fly them they, too, are up there&#151;free. Still, I must tell you that 
the kites are different here in a way that is quite striking to the outsider, a 
difference that sets them apart from the ones kids fly back home in America. 
You see, here the kites are black.<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most people 
don&#146;t know that the Holy Land is a windy place. That the wind courses in 
from the shores of the Mediterranean and over the low hills, scrubbing the 
stones white, rustling through the olive trees, and whistling through the 
cracks in the windows&#151;begging to lift aloft the dreams of the blessed, 
cursed souls who must live here.<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Without a doubt, 
the wind in Gaza is stronger than the West Bank; maybe because it must work so 
much harder to keep dreams in the sky. But the kids in the West Bank need a 
certain strength too. Sure, there is no official siege on Bethlehem, Hebron or 
Ramallah, and for the most part, West Bank kids sleep without the images of 
carnage burnt into the memories, and in some cases, the bodies of Gaza&#146;s 
children.<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But West Bank kids have their own 
bitter reminders of occupation: raids and curfews, tear gas grenades that come 
crashing through bedroom windows, and soldiers&#151;sometimes not much older 
than kids, themselves&#151;who stop them from reaching their schools, 
hospitals, family members and friends.... more.. e-mail<br>

Palestine Chronicle: 18 Jun

generations. On the edge of the village you own a plot of land on which you 
raise olives and grow vegetables to feed your family. You remember your 
grandfather working that land, and smile. He was a good man who loved his 
family and you miss him. One day you return from your olive grove carrying a 
sack filled with olives that your wife will press. You have saved out a couple 
dozen of the best for your wife and children to eat in the evening, before 
retiring for the night. As you turn the corner and start toward your home you

<br> <strong>Free Gaza</strong> <br>
The Editors, The Nation&nbsp;6/4/2010<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>June 21 edition</i><br>
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Israeli commando raid on what has become known as 
the Freedom Flotilla is shocking on a number of levels. What could have driven 
Israel to order its navy to attack, in international waters, a flotilla of 
ships full of human rights activists, MPs from governments around the world, a 
Nobel Prize winner and two former US diplomats? What was there to gain from 
killing civilians&#151;at least nine are dead, along with several dozen 
injured&#151;attempting to deliver desperately needed humanitarian aid for the 
1.5 million people of Gaza suffering under an Israeli blockade? Ha&rsquo;aretz, 
Israel&rsquo;s leading daily, said, &quot;The decision makers&rsquo; negligence 
is threatening the security of Israelis, and Israel&rsquo;s global status.&quot;
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Condemnation of the raid was immediate and 
overwhelming, with the shameful exception of the US government, whose UN 
representative merely expressed &quot;regrets&quot; at the loss of life. 
Demonstrations broke out in cities worldwide, including New York. Many 
countries condemned the attack&#151;notably Turkey, until recently a key 
Israeli ally and regional power broker with whom relations may now be 
irreparably damaged because so many of its nationals were in the flotilla. The 
UN Security Council demanded an end to the Gaza blockade, although Washington 
successfully watered down the official statement and forestalled calls for an 
independent investigation. Without such an inquiry, it&rsquo;s unlikely that 
those responsible for this assault will be held accountable.<br>
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The attack on the Freedom Flotilla is the culmination 
of more than four years of failed policy, in which a siege has been imposed on 
the entire population of Gaza in an attempt to weaken and isolate Hamas after 
its victory in the 2006 parliamentary elections. Israel does not bear sole 
responsibility for an unjust blockade that also undermines its own long-term 
security; indeed, the policy was jointly crafted and executed with the United 
States and has enjoyed the collusion of the European Union, Egypt and even the 
Fatah wing of the Palestinian Authority. more.. e-mail<br>

<strong>Norway supports Palestinian 
economy</strong> <br>
Lars-Kare Legernes, Ma&#146;an News Agency&nbsp;6/3/2010
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some weeks ago [I vistied] the West Bank. 
During that visit I saw with my own eyes the fact that Israel does not want 
peace with Palestine.<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I visited Hebron, Jericho, 
Ramallah and Bethlehem after the Oslo Chamber of Commerce was approached by a 
Palestinian company that hopes to do business with Norway.<br>
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During my visit I saw shoe factories and olive oil 
presses, I met Palestinian businessmen who, just like me, want to have a decent 
life for themselves and their families. I discovered that life under military 
occupation does not offer many opportunities for a decent life, however.<br>
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From permission to import, export, travel, move and 
order goods, excessive inspections, increased tariffs for passage and 
documentation for official to even a hard time getting paid for products 
because the money was coming to Palestinians.<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I 
met a farmer who had an order for tomatoes from Germany. He tried to ship out 
his tomatoes through Jordan after getting all the necessary permits from 
Israel, but when the cargo came to the border, it took the Israelis 3 days to 
check the container for explosives. The tomatoes spoiled and the man lost both 
his customer and his cargo.<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The difficulties I 
observed did not just stem from the reality of a military occupation, but of a 
planned and calculated policy to make life in the West Bank difficult - too 
difficult - for Palestinians in what I believe to be an effort leaning toward 
expulsion.<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I met the Mayor of Hebron and he told 
me 6 million Palestinians live abroad, he said those Palestinians were 
prohibiting from sending more than 2,000 US dollars a year home to their 
families and Palestinian charities. Israel fears that the money can be used for 
terrorism. more.. e-mail<br>

Humanitarian Flotilla Versus Zionist Navy</strong> <br>
Gilad Atzmon, Dissident 
Voice&nbsp;5/27/2010<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Haaretz reports that 
Israel will attempt to block the humanitarian Freedom Flotilla heading toward 
Gaza. However, according to the Israeli paper, the humanitarian cargo would 
then be unloaded, inspected and sent to Gaza overland via the United Nations.
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Typical for Israel, it tries to win a lost 
battle. On the one hand, by stopping the flotilla Israel attempts to maintain 
its regional status as an omnipotent super power that controls the land, the 
air and the sea. On the other hand, the Jewish state pathetically also wants to 
evoke sympathy for being &#145;sensitive&#146; to humanitarian issues and the 
Palestinian plight.<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Israeli government fails 
to gather that the tide has changed. We see through them. We all know what the 
Jewish state stands for. We all know about the devastation in Gaza, we know 
about the siege, the destruction and the crimes against humanity. We all watch 
the Israeli separation wall cutting through Palestinian family&#146;s houses 
and olive orchards. We also follow the racist ethnic cleansing in East 
Jerusalem. The Israelis better save us from their spins and manipulations.<br>
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In case the Israelis still fail to see it, they are 
dealing this time with an international flotilla that is sailing under Turkish 
and Greek flags, a fleet that carries 800 enthusiast activists from all over 
the world. The Israelis are dealing with peace lovers who are determined to 
break through the siege and deliver medical aid, cement, paper and food. On the 
deck we have 35 European parliamentarians who must have decided to say NO to 
Zionist fund raisers. This flotilla is a clear signal to Israel that the game 
is over. Israel is now all but officially isolated. All that is left for Israel 
is to come to terms with its true nature: a shameless racist, murderous and 
terrorist state.<br>

Mamilla Cemetery &#150; What to do with the graves?</strong> <br>
Nir Hasson, 
Haaertz, Israeli Occupation Archive&nbsp;5/20/2010<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Skeletons should not be sanctified &#150; but 
replacing Muslim graves with an ostentatious building dedicated to tolerance 
will only serve as a provocation<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Haaretz&#146;s 
investigative reporting on the eve of Shavuot about the removal of skeletons 
from the Mamilla Muslim cemetery so the Museum of Tolerance can be built there 
rightly prompted questions from the people at the Simon Wiesenthal Center, 
which had initiated the museum project. The questions went something like this: 
&#147;So what now? Let&#146;s assume we drop the project. Will we reestablish 
the cemetery on a site that served as a parking lot for 40 years? After all, if 
we start putting back cemeteries that have disappeared, the country will 
quickly fill up with gravestones and there will be no space for the living. So 
it&#146;s patently absurd.&#148;<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It&#146;s no 
small wonder, however, that a similar case exists not far from Mamilla. Just as 
the large, important, ancient Muslim cemetery in Mamilla is in the heart of 
Jewish-Israeli Jerusalem, the large, important, ancient Jewish cemetery on the 
Mount of Olives is in the heart of the Muslim-Palestinian city. The two 
cemeteries can be seen as mirror images of each other.<br>
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Each of them passed into the hands of opposing sides 
during the War of Independence. In the 1960s, Israel destroyed part of the 
Mamilla cemetery and built a parking lot on it. During those same years, the 
Jordanians destroyed part of the Jewish cemetery to build a gas station. Over 
the past decade, workmen have returned to both sites. On the Mount of Olives, a 
major project is underway to restore the part of the cemetery that was 
destroyed. At Mamilla, excavations have been undertaken to remove skeletons to 
make room for the Museum of Tolerance. Both moves are a mistake.<br>
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The gravestones on the Mount of Olives are a fiction. 
They are actually a theater set of a cemetery because no one really knows where 
the people are buried; fragments of their headstones lay in piles left by the 
Jordanian bulldozers..... -- See also:Source more.. e-mail<br>

<strong>A Cloud over Jerusalem</strong> <br>
Uri Avnery, Dissident 
Voice&nbsp;5/1/2010<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Everyone has the right 
to change his or her mind. Even Danny Tirzeh.<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Colonel Tirzeh was responsible for planning the wall that &#147;envelopes&#148; 
Jerusalem &#150; the one that cuts the city off from the West Bank in order to 
turn it into the United Capital Of Israel For All Eternity.<br>
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And now, suddenly, Tirzeh pops up as the main opponent 
of the wall he himself planned. He wants to move it, so as to leave the lands 
of al-Walaja village on the &#147;Israeli&#148; side.<br>
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Colonel has ceased acting on behalf of the Israeli 
army and now represents private entrepreneurs who want to build 14 thousand 
housing units for 45 thousand Jewish souls. All this, of course, for the 
greater good of Zionism, the Jewish people, Israel&#146;s Eternal Capital, and 
many tens of millions of shekels.<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Colonel Tirzeh 
is not just anybody. He is a symbol.<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For years I 
kept meeting him in the halls of the Supreme Court. He had become almost a 
fixture: the star witness, the expert and the moving spirit in scores of 
hearings dealing with the Separation and Annexation Wall.<br>
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He knows everything. Every kilometer of the Wall and 
the Fence. Every hill, every stone. He always carries with him a large bundle 
of maps which he lays before the judges, earnestly explaining why the Wall must 
pass here and not there, why the security of the state demands that the 
Palestinian villages be separated from their land, why leaving an olive grove 
in the hands of its owner would expose Israeli soldiers to mortal danger. more..

<strong>Outpost settlers uproot 30 olive trees east of Qalqiliya

4/30/2010 - Qalqiliya - Ma'an -Kafr Qaddum village residents said 
they woke up to settlers from the Hifat Gilad outpost of the illegal Qedumin 
settlement bloc tearing up some 30 olive trees on private lands. The trees, 
part of the agricultural land belonging to Saleh Shtewi and his brothers, were 
torn up at the south-eastern end of the village, abutting the settlement. 
Fields in the area had previously been declared a closed military zone, locals 
said, keeping farmers from planting or harvesting their crops. Some were able 
to secure special permits during harvest seasons from Israeli authorities, 
however this did not always guarantee access to groves and orchards if settlers 
were present in the area.<br>

pressing in the occupied Palestinian territories was considerably lower in 
2009, compared with previous years. Almost 19,860 tons of olives were pressed 
in 2009, extracting 4,771 tons of olive oil -- a decline in olive press output, 
which in 2008 saw 17,584 tons of oil extracted from 76,388 tons of pressed 
olives in 2008, the PCBS statistics indicated, revealing a poor olive harvest 
in 2009. The highest quantity of extracted oil in 2009 was 1,585 tons from 
6,304 of olive pressed in Jenin and Tubas governorates, while the lowest 
quantity of extracted oil was 103 tons from 389 tons of pressed olive in

<strong>PA ministry seizes fake olive oil</strong><br>
4/12/2010 - 
Nablus - Ma'an - The Ramallah-based Ministry of Agriculture confiscated 
considerable quantities of sub-par olive oil on Monday in occupied East 
Jerusalem and Hebron. The tainted olive oil, sold at 110 shekels per bottle, 
was a mixture of low-grade olive and cooking oils and likely originated from 
Israel, the ministry's undersecretary Azzam Tubeleh said. Tubeleh said the 
confiscation was undertaken in coordination with PA security forces, after he 
was informed by a colleague that a Nablus shop was selling the counterfeit 
olive oil, which was labeled as originating from the Palestinian Al-Mansha 
town. Following an investigation, the ministry and forces seized the goods in 
two warehouses in Ezzariya, East Jerusalem, and Hebron. The ministry is 
currently testing the produce to verify the olive oil's source and will release 
its findings once the investigation is complete, Tubeleh added, further. . .<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>A short description and a 7 minute video on a 
two-day trip to the Galilee, North Palestine.</i> It was strangely uplifting to 
spend two nights and three days in the Galilee, North Palestine. We visited 
good friends, made new friends, saw 3000 year old olive trees, walked in the 
ruins depopulated villages, and shopped and ate in Palestinian towns which 
survived 62 years of colonial apartheid. We crossed from Bethlehem to occupied 
East Jerusalem with a wave of an Israeli soldier&rsquo;s hand (who did not 
bother to check papers of an Israeli car. A few minutes later we crossed the 
Green line (borders before 1967) that is neither marked or guarded. The 
imaginary green line had long disappeared since Israeli colonies go deep into 
the occupied West Bank. But in the areas of West Jerusalem, we could still see 
many signs of the three dozen Palestinian villages depopulated since 1948. Then 
taking &quot;route 6&quot; north. This highway was built on newly confiscated 
Palestinian village lands. Over 530 Palestinian towns and villages were 
depopulated. The remaining 130 villages and towns had most of their land taken 
and now the remaining Palestinians who comprise 20% of the Israeli population 
live on about 2% of the land while the Jewish population controls the rest 
(which is mostly Palestinian property). When we take the whole of Palestine 
(West Bank and Gaza included), we see that Palestinians who remained (some 50% 
of the population is restricted to less than 10% of historic Palestine. Thus 
access to land is nearly 9 folds more to the Jewish population (most of it not 
native) even without the return of refugees. We visited devastated Palestinian 
villages like Iqrit (a catholic christian community of which only the church 
remains), Al-Zeeb (a fishing muslim community where the mosque and the few 
remaining buildings are converted for recreation of Israelis), and Al_Bassa

<strong>Ramallah 
is not Palestine</strong> <br>
Sandy Toalan, Le Monde Diplomatique, Israeli 
Occupation Archive&nbsp;4/1/2010<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Despite 
condemnation over Jerusalem and Gaza, Israel has boasted of improved conditions 
in parts of the West Bank. Yet Ramallah, with its coffee bars and restaurants, 
is far away from Area C, with its refugee camps, roadblocks, military patrols 
and harassment, where nothing much has changed<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 
Ramallah, on a sliver of land inside the occupied West Bank, it&#146;s possible 
to imagine what Palestinian freedom might feel like. Major Israeli roadblocks 
and checkpoints are down or unmanned, allowing drivers who used to be stalled, 
fuming, to travel nearly unimpeded from Jericho, up the ancient hills to 
Ramallah, and on to Nablus in northern Palestine. Inside this fragment of a 
fragment of land, the economy is picking up, as shipments of soap, olive oil, 
vegetables, soft drinks and even local beer move smoothly to their West Bank 
destinations. Bloomberg has noticed that the area shows an annual growth rate 
of 7%.<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here, in the political and commercial 
centre of the West Bank, a relative sense of ease and prosperity has emerged as 
new shops and bars serve well-educated and discerning customers. 
&#147;World-class vibrant beats in the evenings and fine-dining at all 
times,&#148; reads the Facebook page for Orjuwan, a popular Ramallah lounge.

to Liberty Enclave, where residents experience a taste of prosperity and rising 
quality of life in this small but significant part of Palestinian West Bank

arbitrary decisions of teenaged soldiers, these Palestinians can now enjoy a 
modicum of freedom to move about and do business.... more.. e-mail<br>

Budrus marks Land Day with olive tree planting and nonviolent resistance
</strong><br>
4/1/2010 - International Solidarity Movement - 31 March - Nearly 
100 residents of Budrus, Israli activist and internationals comemorated Land 
Day with a nonviolent march and tree planting action. The IOF used tear gas, 
sound bombs and rubber-coated steel bullets to violently repress the 
commemoration. Less than ten villagers were hit with rubber-coated steel 
bullets resulting in no serious injuries. About fifteen demonstrators were 
treated on-site for severe tear gas inhalation. There were no arrests made. As 
the IOF soldiers made their hasty retreat, the demonstrators happened upon the 
remnants of Israel's vain attempt to suppress the nonviolent popular 
resistance. Three barrels of tear gas canisters had been left during the 
soldiers haphazard exit from the village. Each once housed 400 tear gas 
canisters and the evidence they had been filled to the brim was scatted about 
the farmfield.<br>

3/31/2010 - Hebron - Ma'an - Representatives of 
the European Union, French and Spanish offices in Jerusalem will attend the 
court appearance of a PLO Executive Committee member detained on Palm Sunday 
during Bethlehem protests, the official's aides said. The court appearance was 
set for Wednesday, when Abbas Zaki will stand on as yet unannounced charges for 
his role in a non-violent protest against the Israeli decision to refuse entry 
of West Bank Christian worshipers to Jerusalem for the Palm Sunday march from 
the Mount of Olives into the Old City. A representative of the French Foreign 
Ministry told reporters Tuesday that the ongoing detention of Zaki and 11 other 
Palestinians who participated in the non-violent protest was illegal, and their 
release was demanded. According to a statement from Zaki's office, non-violent 
popular rallies will continue across Palestine demanding his release.<br>

Sheikh Jarrah garden reclaimed in Land Day celebration</strong><br>
3/31/2010 - 
International Solidarity Movement - In honor of Land Day, an upbeat group of 
local residents and school children gathered on Wednesday in front of the 
half-occupied Al Kurd home in Sheikh Jarrah. Neighbors, friends and supporters 
cleaned up the garden and planted olive trees. The conspicuous and unusual 
absence of both settlers and police contributed greatly to the positive mood of 
the day, although the ongoing threat of further evictions looms over the whole 
neighborhood. The al-Kurd family live in the back half of their home, but were 
evicted from the newly built front partition in December 2009. The day's 
actions were seen by many present as a sign of defiance against the illegal 
presence of Israeli settlers in the front part of the house, and against the 
imminent court proceedings which may be used to force them from the back half.

<strong>Israel prevents Christian pilgrims from 
visiting Bethlehem</strong> <br>
Palestine Note&nbsp;3/31/2010<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In a response to a totally nonviolent protest by 
Palestinian Christians and Muslims demanding their freedom of movement the 
Israeli army has effectively banned entry of Christian pilgrims and tourists 
from visiting the birth place of Christ.<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The 
protest on March 28th focused on the Israeli restrictions to Palestinians from 
Bethlehem from participating in the Palm Sunday events in the holy city of 
Jerusalem, a mere 8 miles away. For centuries Christians from around the world 
have reenacted the triumphant entry of Jesus to Jerusalem from the Mount of 
Olives one week before his crucifixion, burial and resurrection.<br>
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Protesters marched from the Nativity Church in 
Bethlehem towards the checkpoint near Rachel&rsquo;s Tomb. In addition to 
Palestinians, the protest included members of international solidarity groups 
as well as a number of Israeli peace activists.<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Additionally, and in keeping with the biblical story of the entry of Jesus to 
Jerusalem, the marchers waving palms and olive branches were led by a man 
riding a donkey.<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the protesters arrived at 
the checkpoint they appear to have caught the Israelis totally off guard even 
though the march that was sponsored by the Palestinian NGO Holy Land Trust was 
publicized using local media for the past week. The private security company 
hired to man the checkpoint escaped leaving the protesters the ability to pass 
through the checkpoint without restrictions. No soldiers appeared to stop them, 
no one declared the area a military zone and so the protesters which included a 
senior member of the Fatah movement continued their march.... -- See also:

<strong>Israel's

Electronic Intifada: 29 Mar 2010 - Every year, 
consumers the world over unwittingly spend billions of dollars on diamonds 
crafted in Israel, thereby helping to fund one of the world's most protracted 
and contentious conflicts. Most people are unaware that Israel is one of the 
world's leading producers of cut and polished diamonds. As diamonds are 
normally not hallmarked, consumers cannot distinguish an Israeli diamond from 
one crafted in India, Belgium, South Africa or elsewhere. The global diamond 
industry and aligned governments, including the EU, have hoodwinked consumers 
into believing the diamond trade has been cleansed of diamonds that fund human 
rights abuses, but the facts are startlingly different. Se&aacute;n Clinton

and attempted to take their cameras before throwing tear-gas canisters and stun 
grenades, Swidan said. In a statement, Nablus Deputy Governor Anan Al-Atira,

<strong>Report: Israeli settlers uproot 25 olive trees near Nablus</strong><br>

3/19/2010 - Nablus - Ma'an - Settlers from Israel's Eli area uprooted 25 olive 
trees from the Al-Batshisha neighborhood of Qaryut village in the northern West 
Bank, an official said Friday. Residents discovered the destruction Thursday 
morning, when they arrived at the agricultural lands approximately 600 meters 
away from the Eli settlement. Ghassan Daghlas, who holds the settlement file 
for the northern West Bank, reported the incident, which followed on the heels 
of the destruction of at least 40 fruit trees just north of the area the week 
before. Qaryut village council head Abed An-Naser Al-Qaryuti said &quot;this is 
the second time the settlers had uprooted and chopped olive trees of the 
village only within a week. &quot; Al-Qaryuti said the trees were on land 
belonging to Mohammad Jaber,Ahmad Jaber, Abed Al-Aziz Al-Mardawi and Yaser 
Hasen.<br>

3/19/2010 - International Solidarity 
Movement - The smell of tear gas hung over the villages of Ni'lin and Bil'in 
today. The shouts demanded an end to apartheid and access to farmlands. The odd 
and surreal status quo was maintained this Friday. The attempts to squash the 
nonviolent popular resistance have been in vain. Like the rocky, Palestinian 
landscape, dotted with olive trees, this resistance is fertile. As these olive 
trees have been uprooted or burned, the state of Israel has attempted to sow 
these popular demonstrations with salt. It has been to no avail. Last week's 
orders posted in Bil'in and Ni'lin declaring the villages closed military zones 
for all of Friday had no effect on the demonstrators or village-life in 
general. Butchers displayed their wares, children laughed and kicked their 
footballs about and the cries for freedom echoed off the walls. The midnight 
raids did nothing to deter the groundswell of the popular struggle.<br>

Israeli military unsuccessfully attempt to invade Iraq Burin: repeat tomorrow?
</strong><br>
3/15/2010 - International Solidarity Movement - 14th March - The 
Israeli military sent eight jeep loads of soldiers to Iraq Burin, near Nablus, 
on Saturday to prevent villagers from accessing their farmland. Violent settler 
attacks on previous Saturdays leave the villagers and their land threatened. 
The military's solution to these attacks has not been to protect the 
Palestinians, but rather to deny them access to their land. As the men of Iraq 
Burin sat peacefully at the edge of their village, watching soldiers and 
settlers on their terraces and in their olive groves on the opposite hillside, 
another group of soldiers approached from the hill immediately above the 
village. With no apparent provocation or reason, soldiers fired volleys of tear 
gas and percussion grenades at the assembled villagers, then seized houses at 
the edge of the village to fire rubber bullets and more tear gas into the 
street. Despite this barrage of weaponry, villagers refused to run and hide, 
and the soldiers ultimately retreated at dusk.<br>

<strong>Olive 
Oil And Tears</strong> <br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>&quot;If the olive tree knew the suffering of 
its owner, its oil would turn into tears&quot;</i>-- Palestinian poet, Mahmoud 
Darwish<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The olive young leaves and flower sprouts 
are denser than ever before. It promises a great season not only of bountiful 
agricultural harvest but of bountiful harvest on the activism front. It is true 
that, as the Palestinian poet stated, if the olive tree knew the suffering of 
its owner, its oil would turn into tears. The Israeli apartheid forces have 
been uprooting olive trees in Beit Jala the last few days. They have also 
intensified their repression and attempts at intimidation of activists (with 
help from Palestinian collaborators). But it is also true that the apartheid 
system is facing grassroots activists everywhere despite all these tactics. 
Today we joined the demonstration in Beit Jala as we did not have a competing 
event at Ush Ghrab. The lack of an event here in Beit Sahour happened because 
the popular committee decided collectively (over 15 people) to put the actions 
before the local forces to decide on how (and if?) to support the popular 
resistance. Yet, we did go to Ush Ghrab in the morning and an Ashkenazi white 
man wearing a blue shirt entered as we were meeting and drinking coffee, 
fiddled with his backpack, for a few minutes, then left. Later, as we were 
leaving, we notice the Israeli army on the hill and the same man with the blue 
shirt &#147;briefing&#148; them.<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soldiers

<strong>America to the rescue, 
(not) again</strong> <br>
Sam Bahour, Ma&#146;an News Agency&nbsp;3/12/2010<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are told that US President Barack Obama has 
taken a leap of political faith in trying to bridge a final peace settlement 
between Palestinians and Israelis. America&rsquo;s weapon of choice is 
&quot;proximity talks,&quot; with the threat that if either side fails to meet 
American expectations, the US will squarely and publicly lay blame. If this was 
a sitcom it would be the opportune time to crack up laughing; regretfully this 
is not the case.<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Real people - whole generations 
- of Palestinians are on the verge of being locked into another decade of 
protracted and violent military occupation. Many Israeli lives and hopes are at 
stake as well.<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It has been reported in the 
Israeli newspaper Ha&rsquo;aretz, that President Obama submitted a letter of 
commitment to the Palestinian side to get these indirect &quot;proximity 
talks&quot; off the ground. The letter notes, &quot;Our core remains a viable, 
independent and sovereign Palestinian State with contiguous territory that ends 
the occupation that began in 1967.&quot;<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is 
not the first time a US administration has used its creativity in crafting new 
terminology to deal with the conflict instead of relying on the time-tested 
body of international law that provides the keys to real progress. In the past, 
in place of &quot;independent state&quot; the US has attached such adjectives 
to the word &quot;state&quot; as &quot;contiguous,&quot; &quot;viable,&quot; 
&quot;economically viable,&quot; &quot;territorial continuity,&quot; and the 
like. In his use of words, President Obama has just picked up where the 
failures of past administrations left off.<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
International law clearly defines what an independent state is and any attempt 
to redefine it is an act of bad faith.<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Israeli 
failed state<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The timing of the US move toward new 
talks is rather conspicuous as well. Israel is proving itself to be a 
&#145;failed state;&#146; a &#145;rogue state&#146; which has become a 
liability to its allies. How are its leaders greeting this latest move? more..

armed only with pick axes and hoes, flattened out the bulldozer tracks and deep 
holes left from uprooted trees, reset two swing sets, and brought in sand by 
the bucket for the new playground. Young olive trees were replanted in place of 
the mature trees that were destroyed during the first days of uprooting last 
week. The playground is used by many of the neighborhood children, and the 
family who owns the land welcomes people to enjoy the shade next to their home 
in the heat of the summer. As people worked in the sun today, army jeeps made 
rounds on the road above the home, and stood watch from the road on the 
opposing side of the highway. One jeep came down to the playground, but people 
continued their work as soldiers took pictures and asked for the Palestinian 
participants identification cards.<br>

<strong>Journalists, residents hurt in Beit Jala anti-wall rally</strong><br>

3/7/2010 - Bethlehem - Ma'an - Three journalists and several demonstrators were 
injured by Israeli forces at a protest against Israel's construction of the 
separation wall in the town of Beit Jala, north of Bethlehem, on Sunday. Some 
200 local protestors attended the rally, with residents attempting to plant 30 
olive tree seedlings on land overturned by Israeli bulldozers. They were 
prevented by Israeli soldiers and border guards deployed in the area. Clashes 
ensued when young Palestinian men began hurling stones toward Israeli forces, 
who responded by firing rubber-coated bullets and tear-gas canisters. The march 
began from the city center on the road toward the Cremisan monestary, where 
Israeli bulldozers began overturning land to make way for the separation wall. 
Palestinian Legislative Council members Mustafa Barghouthi and Fayez As-Saqa 
joined the protest, as well as members of the Beit Jala. . .<br>

caretaker Prime Minister Salam Fayyad Saturday, as he met with members of the 
popular committee against the wall in Beit Jala, Bethlehem. Fayyad spoke with 
international activists and Palestinian committee members at the site of wall's 
latest construction in Beit Jala, condemning the Israeli annexation of land and 
uprooting of olive trees to build the separation wall. &quot;Deep in the roots 
of these olive trees, there is something that reminds us that our people lived 
here from the beginning and will continue to the end,&quot; he told the 
gathered crowds of protestors. &quot; We will continue to work and build in all 
Palestinian territories occupied in 1967, paying no attention to the unjust

Activists work to stop wall construction and uprooting of olive trees in Beit

3/5/2010 - International Solidarity Movement - Beit Jala 
Popular Committee, 4 March - In the early morning on March 2, 2010, Israeli 
bulldozers started uprooting ancient olive trees in the garden of a Palestinian 
family in the town of Beit Jala, North-West of Bethlehem, in order to make room 
for the construction of yet another section of the Apartheid Wall. Wednesday 
morning, the family, which had already lost a significant portion of its lands 
when Israel seized them to build the&nbsp;&quot;by-pass road&quot; 60 that 
connects the equally illegal settlements, found the little playground for the 
children in the garden destroyed and three olive trees directly in front of the 
house chopped off. A red cross was painted two meters away from the 
front&nbsp;door to signal where the Wall is designed to pass. The remaining 
olive trees had been marked with yellow-tags, to be uprooted another day.<br>

<strong>Israeli bulldozers return to Beit Jala</strong><br>
3/3/2010 - 
Bethlehem - Ma'an - Dozens of Palestinians and foreign solidarity activists 
rallied near Bethlehem on Wednesday, in protest of the bulldozing of olive 
trees near a section of Israel's wall, which weaves through the occupied West 
Bank. Witnesses said Israeli forces used limited force against protesters who 
attempted to prevent the bulldozers from approaching the trees, planted in Beit 
Jala. Several demonstrators were dragged on the ground as they refused to 
leave, but no serious injuries were reported. Marwan Sha'ban of the local 
Popular Committee Against Settlements in Bethlehem said &quot;we came here with 
our solidarity friends to say: stop attacking the land, uprooting trees, and 
forcing people out of their houses. &quot;Sha'ban termed any construction on 
privately owned land as illegal, but said the Beit Jala construction flaunted 
the law, noting previous remarks by Fayyad Nasser, a lawyer who represents the 
Beit Jala municipality.<br>
<strong>Israeli bulldozers enter Beit Jala for wall 
construction</strong><br>
3/3/2010 - Bethlehem - Ma'an - Israeli forces 
enforced a closed military zone in Beit Jala, Bethlehem, on Tuesday, to assist 
bulldozers in overturning land in the area to make way for further construction 
of the separation wall, witnesses said. The bulldozers began operating on lands 
near the Cremisan Monastery road, said Leila Awad, whose home is the only one 
in the area. Awad told Ma'an she was surprised to see Israeli bulldozers, 
accompanied by police, enter her land and begin uprooting olive, walnut and 
lemontrees. Israeli forces previously confiscated one and half dunums of her 
land, Awad said, to build a tunnel connecting Jerusalem settlement blocs with 
the Kfar Etzion settlement in Bethlehem. The remainder of her land was 
confiscated to build the rest of the separation wall, only five meters from her 
home, she added. Awad said her family of nine is threatened with eviction. 
Journalists and cameramen were prohibited from accessing the area, as Israeli 
forces enforced a closed military zone. . . . .<br>

King Solomon Undermines Silwan Refugees</strong><br>
Palestine Monitor: 24 Feb 
2010 - A recent flurry of demolition orders in Silwan have raised fresh

Approximately 200 trees were planted as part of the ongoing popular resistance

Palestine 
Chronicle: 23 Feb 2010 - By Robin Yassin-Kassab Footnotes in Gaza: A Graphic 
Novel. Joe Sacco. Metropolitan Books, 2009. This is not what you expect: an 
accomplished and self-reflective work of history enclosed within a layer of war 
reportage &ndash; in comic book form. But Joe Sacco's &quot;Footnotes in 
Gaza&quot; is just that, an unusually effective treatment of Palestinian 
history which may appeal to people who would never read a &lsquo;normal 
book&rsquo; on the subject. The writing, however, is at least as good as 
you&rsquo;d expect from a high quality prose work. Here, for instance, is page 
nine: &ldquo;History can do without its footnotes. Footnotes are inessential at 
best; at worst they trip up the greater narrative. From time to time, as 
bolder, more streamlined editions appear, history shakes off some footnotes 
altogether. And you can see why&hellip; History has its hands full. It 
can&rsquo;t help producing pages by the hour, by the minute. History chokes on 
fresh episodes and swallows whatever old ones it can.&rdquo; The pictures 
&ndash; aerial shots, action shots, urban still lifes, crafted but realist 
character studies &ndash; work as hard as the words. Sacco depicts fear, 
humiliation and anger very well indeed, and often achieves far more with one 
picture than he could in an entire newspaper column. The cranes at work on a 
Jerusalem skyline are worth a paragraph or two of background. So is the fact 
that almost every Palestinian male has a cigarette in his mouth. And when

Eva Bartlett, Inter Press Service, 14 January - &quot;If we had money we'd get 
married right away,&quot; says Samir*, 23. He has found his bride, but not the 
money to hold the wedding. The Israeli siege imposed shortly after Hamas's 
election in early 2006 has ruled out marriage for many. Palestinians 
traditionally marry young, between 18 and 25, but more and more now pass their 
mid-twenties single. With unemployment levels above 45 percent, and the price 
of most goods doubled or more, living, and marrying, are becoming unaffordable. 
Worsening living conditions under the siege are changing relationship patterns. 
While salaried work has traditionally been the man's role, many women have been 
adding to the family's income &ndash; or have sometimes been the sole provider 
&ndash; by selling hand-stitched embroidery. Groups such as Oxfam, the 
Palestinian Agricultural Relief Committee, and other social organisations have 
provided some of the poorest women with small gardens, sheep, rabbits or 
chickens to tend for food and for income.<br>

olive trees in Shaer's plot near the village of Jit in the West Bank's Nablus 
region are almost bare. There will be hardly any olives for his family this 
year, let alone any for sale. &quot;We will pray for rain and wait,&quot; he 
said. He reckoned this year's crop would be less than a quarter of last year's 
&quot;and last year it was not good at all. &quot; Ahmed, an olive farmer form 
the Qalqiliya region, about 30 minutes drive from Tel Aviv, said the meager 
crop was not worth harvesting. &quot;I can only hope for the future,&quot; he 
said. Palestinian olive farmers have been hit by a third consecutive bad or 
poor harvest. Normally, in this region, you get a good crop one year followed 
by a smaller yield the next year, but the two-year cycle appears to have been 
broken - exacerbated by a dry winter in 2008-2009, according to some experts.

prison in Haifa today in protest against the arrest and imprisonment of 
grassroots activist Wa'el Al Faqeeh Abu As Sabe. Demonstrators planted olive

for the release of Palestinian political prisoners. The night that the army 
arrested Wa'el Al Faqeeh, they also arrested 8 other grassroot activists from 
Nablus and surrounding areas. 15km out of Haifa sits the notorious Jelemeh 
prison, known for its interrogation and ill-treatment of Palestinian political 
prisoners. International and Israeli activists gathered under grey skies 
outside the prison yesterday, beating drums and chanting pro-Palestinian 
slogans. Activists planted three olive trees outside the gates of the prison,

11/1/2009 - This Week in Palestine - 
November 2009 - Compiled by the Palestinian Grassroots - Immatin is a small 
village of nearly 2,500 people that is nestled in the hills east of Qalqilia. 
Like so many other villages in Qalqilia, Immatin&#146;s recent history is 
marred by stories of confiscated lands, uprooted olive trees, and the approach 
of the Wall, which threatens to isolate 10,000 of the village&#146;s 27,000 
dunums. To make matters worse, the people of Immatin have the misfortune of 
living just south of the Qedumim settlement. Founded by the religious 
settlement movement Gush Emunim in 1975, Qedumim is populated by settlers 
infamous for their violence, which inevitably increases during the olive 
harvest. These settlers were responsible for nearly a dozen attacks during last 
year&#146;s harvest, when they burned and blocked access to fields and attacked 
farmers with sticks and stones. In just two weeks last October, Qedumim 
settlers perpetrated three attacks in Immatin. -- Links:This Week in Palestine

in 2000 as reaction to Israeli policies and long occupation. The Israeli army

situations, arson was suspected, but a formal investigation has not been opened 
yet. In the Kiryat Ata forest and in the olive groves belonging to Kibbutz 
Yochanan, 60 dunams were ruined. Arson is suspected because of an ongoing

 31 Oct 
2006 -- Olives, a centuries-old mainstay of the Palestinian economy, are in 
peak season for harvest from the middle of October to the beginning of 
November. Forty-five percent of Palestinian agricultural land (228,560 
acres/914,235 dunums) is planted with olive trees. This year&rsquo;s olive 
harvest is a source of hope for a community with over 2/3 of its population 
living in poverty (less than $2. 7/day). As a bumper crop year, the olive 
industry promises to contribute over 118 million USD (based on 2003/4 figures) 
to the fragile West Bank economy - 22 percent of total agricultural 
production.... Israeli movement restrictions, like the closures and the 
Barrier, which Israel has stated are meant to protect Israeli citizens, raise 
concerns over the ability of Palestinian farmers to complete this cycle....

olive farmers</strong><br>

 Qalqiliya - 
Welcome rain continued to fall in the northern West Bank on Thursday following 
storms on Wednesday. Following the rain, local farmers in the Qalqiliya 
governorate were optimistic about the current olive harvest, hoping that the 
price of olive oil would rise in response. They said that they hoped that the 
price of one kilogram of olive oil would be between US $3. 5 and $ 4. 5 this 
year. For most Palestinians farmers, the olive harvest is their primary source 
of income for the year and the price of olive oil has a significant impact on 
their livelihood for the whole year. [end] <br>
