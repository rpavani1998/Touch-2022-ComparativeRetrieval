Interesting observations, I'll add a few more. My property is 
surrounded by oak trees, and I've pushed the envelope by growing fruit trees 
right up to the canopy. In general, the apples that get Morning sun until noon 
seem to fruit prolifically, whereas the apples that get no Morning sun, but 
afternoon sun seem to fruit a lot less, much more biennially. What's 
interesting is that for example stone fruits like peaches are much less 
sensitive, fruiting like crazy in the same locations.<br>
<br>
As a whole, I've 
noticed much more open growth near the oak trees. The more the noon sun is 
blocked, the leggier and less productive the trees are. So noon time sun seems 
the most critical. I've not seen any issues with northern spy, mine gets sun 
from AM until about 1PM and is loaded with fruit. </blockquote> <br>

Harvestman, my northern spy is not under the oaks, but next to 
them with East facing sun until 1 or 2PM. I think it gets enough overhead light 
to really fruit well. I don't think this invalidates what you observed. From 
the sounds of it, yours is actually under canopy of other trees. I've found 
that apples don't like to have overhead canopy of any sorts. Adjacent is ok, 
but directly overhead even if only half of the tree is covered is detrimental 
to any apple tree. </blockquote> <br>
<br>
Im in the situation where I get low 
angle sun thru trees in the morning for about an hour from 9AM to about 10AM 
then slight shade until about 10:30AM. Intense sun 10:30 until around 3:30 then 
again sun thru trees until about 5:30.<br>
<br>
My apples: Jonamac, Kidds 
Orange Red, Orleans Reinette. The KOR and OR are British and French, and I 
figured since those regions get much less sun (about 30% less) than I do here 
in NY, my situation may work well for them. During the peak summer months, I 
will get about 6 hours of this intense open aired sun.<br>
<br>
Have you found 
intense noon time sun for 4-5 hours and light sun outside of that frame to work 
well on these types of apples?<br>
<br>
Since you're in SoCal, I thought maybe 
you had some european varieties that would need some shade in your area to make 
it to harvest without crumbling on the tree.<br>
<br>
Let me know if you can 
expand on your experiences with less than all day sun<br>
<br>
Thanks man, nice 
work on the site.<br>

Eric, you shouldn't 
have to worry about what apples you can grow based on the amount of shade your 
apples are getting. You will only be limited by the length of your season, 
which means you should try to grow apples that do well in NY. Other than that, 
don't worry about the shade they're getting.<br>
<br>
Let's get some facts 
straight first, my garden is in Central California, not Southern California, we 
get a lot of fog in the hills right above santa Cruz, for example my cox orange 
pippin will get foggy Mornings with sun from maybe noon-4PM, after which it's 
shaded from the oaks. I've not seen any issues from that. I did notice that 
apples closer to the oaks that provide Western shade delay the harvest by about 
3-4 weeks. For example, my cox orange pippin ripens in early October while the 
one up the hill where there is more sun ripens early September. So in NY you 
would probably just want to make sure your apples ripen before the onset of 
extended periods of sub-freezing weather. (Most Winter apples can tolerate 
short exposures to 20F, the types of frosts that might be common in the Fall.)

Cox's Orange Pippin grows at an 
orchard close to here (40 min away), and they're ripe early/mid September as 
well. My season isnt exceptionally long like yours, but blossoms here are 
usually 2nd week in May, typically we dont get a strong freeze until around 2nd 
or 3rd week in November at the earliest.<br>

For Kidd's 
Orange Red there is an orchard about 90 minutes south of me that has it, I've 
never been there but they record &quot;Early October&quot; as the harvest date. 
Orleans Reinette, I've seen Late September and Early October. So if your 
situation with less sun holds true for me, Im looking at a tight harvest every 
year contending with the first freeze.<br>
<br>
I guess you really dont know 
until you put the tree in the ground.<br>
Its going to be interesting, and I 
hope I didnt make a mistake by choosing these 2 varieties. The sun angle is 
getting higher and higher now, clearing the trees more and more so it may not 
have as much of an effect as I'm thinking. Anything past October 1st however 
gets dramatically less sun, like 4-5 hours worth a day, mostly late morning to 
mid afternoon.<br>
<br>
Its a very odd situation, different native climates 
between me and England, I get more sun, but im simulating their climate with 
some shade. Who knows what will happen, I remember 1 quote though: 
&quot;Remember, the biggest mistake about planting a fruit tree is not to do 
it!&quot;<br>
<br>
We'll see if &quot;Morning sun, afternoon shade&quot; is 
good enough.<br>
For fun, I've attached my climate data as well as Orleans 
France and Southampton England, places known to grow these varieties.

<dd> <strong>Climate Zone:</strong> sunset 15/USDA 9b </dd> </dl> Eric, with 
full sun from 10:30AM to 3:30PM I can't see that you would get that much of a 
delay, if any at all. The trees that have that much delay are right next to the 
oaks, almost under them, so that they get shaded after about 1PM. My Kidds 
Orange red ripens when expected and it looses sun about 3:30PM.<br>
<br>
I 
seriously doubt you have anything to worry about. If anything, your apples may 
even be better quality with the extra chill in the late Fall from the extra 
shade you will get after Sept. 21st. I also don't think you have to pick 
varieties from cool climates like England. You need to select varieties that 
are good for NY. I think it's a crime that you don't have a MacIntosh, given 
that the best macs come out of NY. Top <br>

Thats great to hear! <br>
That 
makes me feel a lot better about my situation.<br>
Thank you. <br>

I dont 
think its a crime, because I can go to any orchard and pick/buy them, but I 
wouldnt anyway. I only have room in my yard for these 3 trees. Macs off the 
tree here are very bitter and sour. Maybe I've had so many that I've been 
turned off. If you like Macs, try a Jonamac. I have a few scions from 
yesterday's clippings if you want some, free of charge for you (Contact me via 
PM). They're exceptional eaters and superior to Macs IMO. Its the crispness and 
juiciness of a Mac but with the spicy undertones of a very ripe Jonathan.<br>

<br>Thanks again for your wisdom and this great community. <br>
Im so new to 
this, I dont know where to turn for answers sometimes.<br>
