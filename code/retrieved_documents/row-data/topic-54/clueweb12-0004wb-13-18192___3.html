<p>Hostas are shade plants, right? Not necessarily. Hostas are usually termed 
'shade-tolerant' plants, meaning they will grow in shade or partial shade. But 
shade might not be their ideal growing condition. Some hostas need a period of
full sun to look and perform their best. </p> 
<p>It is not recommended that any Hosta be in full sun all the time, but many 
Hostas are more vigorous and display their most vibrant colors if given at 
least some sun exposure.</p> 
<h3><br>
A Quick Rule of Thumb</h3> Hostas with yellow leaves or fragrant 
flowers can stand more sun than Hostas with green, blue or white leaves.
<p>There are, of course, always exceptions and you may know of a Hosta that is 
basking and thriving in full sun, but that is not rule.</p> 
<h3><br>
Hostas for Full Sun: Yellow and Fragrant Hostas.</h3> 
<p>In general, yellow hostas need to be planted in a sunny location to keep 
their yellow color vibrant. Without at least a couple of hours of full sun, the 
yellow color will fade to green, or worse, look like a green leaf that is 
yellowing.</p> 
<p>Similarly, fragrant hostas, those in the species H. plantaginea, need 
exposure to sun to develop their flowers. H. plantaginea is one of the most 
heat tolerant Hosta species.</p> 
<p>Keep in mind, the heat experienced in a full sun location can vary from 
area to area and even during different times of the day. Full sun in the 
morning hours will not be as intense as full sun at noon. While yellow and 
fragrant hostas need some sun exposure, they do not like to bake or fry in the 
sun. So if your site is extremely hot or dry, you will need to keep any hostas 
sitting in full sun well watered.</p> 
<h3><br>
Hostas for Partial Shade: Green, Blue and White</h3> 
<p>No Hosta is going to thrive in deep shade. They all need some sunlight to 
photosynthesize. The shade tolerant varieties seem to do best in an exposure of 
morning sun and afternoon shade Too much sun exposure will result in burned 
leaves, starting from the edges inward. They will look brown and dry, like the 
leaves in the photo to the right.</p> 
<p>Blue hostas require the most protection from the sun. This is because the 
blue color is actually a waxy coating on the leaves. The leaves themselves are 
a shade of green. The waxy coating gives them a blue tint. In full, hot sun, 
this waxy coating melts and exposes the green leaf underneath, changing the 
color of your plant from blue to green. It could also expose the leaves to 
burning. Spraying the leaves with a pesticide or fertilizer can also cause the 
waxy coating to melt.</p> 
<h3><br>
Special Consideration: White Hostas</h3> Unfortunately, only trial 
and error can tell you which Hostas with white variegation can tolerate full 
sun without burning. The thicker the leaves, the more tolerant they will be of 
full sun. White variegated Hostas with thin leaves, like 'White Christmas', 
should be confined to partial shade to maintain their best appearance.
<p>Another problem with white variegated hostas is that the leaves are white 
because they have minimal amounts of chlorophyll. In full sun, the chlorophyll 
levels can increase and cause the leaves to pick up a green cast and look less 
variegated. So only morning sun is recommended for white variegated hostas and 
the thinner the leaves, the less sun.</p> 
<h3><br>
Let Your Hosta Tell You When It&rsquo;s Had Too Much Sun</h3> You can 
follow the rules and choose the recommend plants and still not have success. 
The only real gage for how sun tolerant a plant is, is how it is performing. 
There are two clear signs that tell you your Hosta is getting too much sun:
<ol> 
<li>Browning on the tips or outside edges of leaves
<p> </p></li> 
<li>Dull color or faded spots on leaves </li> </ol> 
<p>If your Hosta plants aren&rsquo;t doing as well as you would like, 
don&rsquo;t be afraid to move them. Hostas are strong plants ad can withstand 
digging and replanting.</p>
