<p>BigBunny says:<br>
 Yoda wins?! he ran away to Dagobah cause he knew he 
couldn&rsquo;t beat Anakin, Vader wins easy \m/</p> 
<p>He ran away cause he couldnt beat palpatine, besides indiana jones would 
have been slaughtered by wolverine so i guess none of it is true is it</p> </li>
<li> April 10th, 2012 at 2:33 pm Ken Benobi says: 
<p>Yoda trained Luke, who had Vader beat. Therefore, Yoda could beat Vader. 
Cmon, he&rsquo;s a Muppet with a lightsaber! How could he NOT win?</p> </li> 
<li> April 10th, 2012 at 10:24 am R2Q5 says: 
<p>Yoda turned Vader! Why not? It happened twice already!</p> </li> 
<li> April 10th, 2012 at 7:11 am R. says: 
<p>Are you serious? Was this a favorite character contest or a who would win 
contest? I whish I could see some of these battles&hellip;</p> </li> 
<li> April 10th, 2012 at 1:13 am BigBunny says: 
<p>Yoda wins?! he ran away to Dagobah cause he knew he couldn&rsquo;t beat 
Anakin, Vader wins easy \m/</p> </li> 
<li> April 9th, 2012 at 7:12 pm Ralphie says: 
<p>Yoda?Truth is we all know this Battle really took place in a Universe Far 
Far away from the DC Universe.And the Accounting Firm of Price 
Waterhouse/Sideshow who Tallied the Secret Votes must have been High on the 
Spice Melange&rsquo; the whole Battle.Because Guild 3rd Stage Navigators from 
Arakis were seen arriving and leaving SS Headquarters the whole time and now 
are nowhere to be found.And now everybody at Sideshow&rsquo;s Eyes have a Blue 
Tinge.</p> </li> 
<li> April 6th, 2012 at 10:55 am Paulie says: 
<p>Vader is the poster child for Star Wars and the greatest fictional villain 
of all time.</p> 
<p>I&rsquo;m really hoping he wins this</p> </li> 
<li> April 6th, 2012 at 10:40 am scribe_well says: 
<p>Can I vote for Galactus?</p> </li> 
<li> April 6th, 2012 at 6:28 am Ben says: 
<p>Should have been Batman all the way. Least Vader has a similar color scheme
</p> </li> 
<li> April 6th, 2012 at 2:46 am Eric says: 
<p>yes..yes.. The Emperor seemed to have the upper hand, Dooku fled.. to be 
saved the disgrace of being defeated.. but Vader is just the underling of the 
Emperor, and we all know that Vader has a weakness for good.. MUAHAHAHA.. Good 
shall triumph!</p> </li> 
<li> April 5th, 2012 at 11:06 pm Gabriel Gaucher says: 
<p>c&rsquo;mon! freddy krueger cut them all! he can be beat! is a freaking 
nightmare how darth vader can beat him! freddy can do whatever he want to! damn!
</p> </li> 
<li> April 5th, 2012 at 7:08 pm MARILYN TAYLOR says: 
<p>win yoda will hmmmmmmm&hellip;&hellip;</p> </li> 
<li> April 5th, 2012 at 7:05 pm Scott says: 
<p>The dark lord of the Sith has totally got this. Watch it happen.</p> </li> 
<li> April 5th, 2012 at 4:56 pm Daff says: 
<p>Yoda will banish Vader &ndash; the Dark Side will not overcome</p> </li> 
<li> April 5th, 2012 at 12:50 pm JediJones says: 
<p>Evil will always triumph because good is dumb!</p> </li> 
<li> April 5th, 2012 at 12:06 pm Ralphie says: 
<p>Dooku laughed the entire time he was kicking Yoda&rsquo;s little green 
Butt.Palpatine tossed Yoda around like a Beach Ball.No way Yoda should win this 
final Battle.The only possibility is for Yoda to use the Force to turn into 
Satele Shan.</p> </li> 
<li> April 5th, 2012 at 12:05 pm Kixxo says: 
<p>Vader is going down. The only thing Yoda ever lost was his hair!</p> 
<p>Little Green Jedi Masters Rule!!!!!<br>
 &hellip;and R2-D2</p> </li> 
<li> April 5th, 2012 at 11:26 am Travis says: 
<p>Yoda will win this one finally.</p> </li> 
<li> April 5th, 2012 at 11:23 am GhostWolf says: 
<p>Oh come on&hellip;Vader is way WAY cooler compared to Yoda.</p> </li> 
<li> April 5th, 2012 at 11:11 am don howard says: 
<p>should be yoda. nice bracket game</p> </li> 
<li> April 5th, 2012 at 11:09 am Gravitz says: 
<p>The new trilogy didn&rsquo;t help out poor Vader, conversely&hellip;</p> 
</li> 
<li> April 5th, 2012 at 11:03 am Tony Provenzano says: 
<p>Vader did outlive Yoda in the original trilogy&hellip;</p> </li> 
<li> April 5th, 2012 at 10:39 am EnShinNoi says: 
<p>Yoda because Hayden ruined Vader.</p> </li> 
<li> April 5th, 2012 at 10:16 am tomandshell says: 
<p>Yoda is a great character, but he failed to defeat both Count Dooku and 
Palpatine before retreating and going into hiding. He is a better teacher than 
fighter, but I&rsquo;m voting for him anyway.</p> </li> 
<li> April 5th, 2012 at 9:46 am CraxyD says: 
<p>Yoda all the way. He&rsquo;s faster and has tons more experience. Old age 
and treachery will most always overcome youth and skill</p> </li> 
<li> April 4th, 2012 at 7:01 pm Trooper says: 
<p>No daring, last minute rescues this time Mr. Jones.</p> </li> 
<li> April 4th, 2012 at 10:19 am Kevin says: 
<p>VADER all the way. Yoda is good but you cant beat the empire!</p> </li> 
<li> April 4th, 2012 at 9:13 am GhostWolf says: 
<p>Is Indy really catching up to Yoda right now&hellip;?</p> </li> 
<li> April 4th, 2012 at 3:17 am BigBunny says: 
<p>Vader for the win! still think Gandalf should&rsquo;ve been in this \m/</p> 
</li> 
<li> April 3rd, 2012 at 9:16 am R E Daffron says: 
<p>Yoda all the way</p> </li> 
<li> April 3rd, 2012 at 8:58 am R2Q5 says: 
<p>Indy found out who Batman is and used the whip on him while dressed as 
Bruce Wayne. Indy caught him by surprise since he was dressed in a suit and 
they were just having dinner. Wayne was hiring Indy to find a lost relic.</p> 
</li> 
<li> April 3rd, 2012 at 7:21 am Erik Pe&ntilde;a says: 
<p>VADER VS YODA YYYEEEEAAHHHH</p> </li> 
<li> April 3rd, 2012 at 1:15 am don howard says: 
<p>well would have loved to see this on the big screen</p> </li> 
<li> April 2nd, 2012 at 11:40 pm Legolas says: 
<p>Come now, really? Should have known it will be 2 Star Wars characters in 
the final. People are so predictable.</p> </li> 
<li> April 2nd, 2012 at 11:22 pm Darren says: 
<p>Star Wars all the way to the Final Dual!</p> </li> 
<li> April 2nd, 2012 at 10:12 pm rbravo23 says: 
<p>yes!!!!! the epic battle!!!<br>
 Yoda vs darkvader</p> </li> 
<li> April 2nd, 2012 at 7:12 pm ZF says: 
<p>Really&hellip;&hellip;.Indy beats Batman??? Very well then, Yoda VS Vader 
it is&hellip;</p> </li> 
<li> April 2nd, 2012 at 6:38 pm Goblin King says: 
<p>Ok, so I guess the conspiracy was to make sure that Darth Vader and Yoda 
ended up in the finals. I can&rsquo;t disagree with that, though Indiana Jones

<p>Go Indy!!!! Unfortunately Yoda is the master so&hellip;.<br>
 And Freddy? 
Vader is your worst nightmare&hellip;.. </p>

<p>it was Vader vs Yoda all along. *sigh*</p> 
<p>I&rsquo;m here for the prize anyways.</p> </li>

<p>The final battle seems pretty cut and dry. Surprise surprise&hellip; way 
too many Star Wars fans out there not to let it happen.</p> </li> 
<li> April 2nd, 2012 at 1:39 pm ftrez says: 
<p>I&rsquo;m disappointed in that final 4. I guess this means that movies are 
more popular than comics in the collectibles community.</p> 
<p>But c&rsquo;mon, guys! Indy over Batman??? Really??</p> </li>

<p>How can anyone beat Freddy? He basically is a zombie! So zombies will just 
ignore him. Even Vader has living flesh. Come on people!</p> </li> 
<li> April 2nd, 2012 at 1:06 pm Hank says:

<li> April 2nd, 2012 at 12:57 pm JediJones says:

<p>This poll is a sham of autobot voting as I voted for Batman (who would 
never lose to Jones) where Batman was leading the vote at 50.45% &amp; returned 
to the poll a second later and he was down to 48.48%. Really now, how does that 
happen!!!</p> </li>

<p>Look at the results for the Wolverine vs Indiana fight. It turned out 50/50 
from what I saw today. I guess it went by some computer program weighting 
system? Of course, those are percentages so the tenths place could have pushed 
it over for Indie. Either way, it was close so Wolvie went down swing&hellip; 
Indie&hellip; Wolvie&hellip; Didn&rsquo;t see that coming.</p> </li>

<p>Indiana Jones climbing these rankings is ridiculous. He is an archaeologist

love Indy, but WTF?</p> 
<p>And Freddy Krueger and the Red Skull in the Final Four? What are these 
voters smoking?</p> </li> 
<li> March 28th, 2012 at 12:29 pm Jay says: 
<p>Yes it looks to be a popularity contest, but it&rsquo;s still fun to watch

<p>I&rsquo;m guessing a Yoda VS Vader matchup. Who would have thought that 
Superman would get eliminated in the 1st round?!?</p> </li> 
<li> March 28th, 2012 at 8:52 am sprig says: 
<p>This has gone from a &ldquo;who would honestly win&rdquo; to a popularity 
contest. Like, for example, Indiana Jones would be able to beat Wolverine in a 
fight. At this point, it&rsquo;s going to probably be Yoda vs Darth Vader in 
the finale.</p> </li>

<li> March 27th, 2012 at 2:04 pm Ralphie says: 
<p>Lets face it this is not a Heroes/Villians super power contest..or all the 
remaining would have been eliminated already.While Zod is on Earth no Light 
Saber,Web,Steel Claws,Batarang or Whip can touch him.So now it&rsquo;s up to 
The Force to see how ridiculous this contest turns out Batman.</p> </li>

<p>Well what is happening here, is people vote their favorite hero/villain to 
win not taking in consideration that certain powers, outweigh others.. like obi 
wan would use the force on batman and thou I am a big batman fan, I fear the 
force would smack batman sideways.. and clearly not all voters look at it the 
same way&hellip;</p> </li>

<p>Indy actually COULD defeat Wonder Woman pretty easily. WW loses her powers 
when tied up by a man (hey, don&rsquo;t look at me, I don&rsquo;t make the 
rules). All Indy would have to do is lasso her with his whip (as he does Willie 
at the end of TEMPLE OF DOOM) and she&rsquo;s instantly helpless. And if he 
REALLY pisses her off, he could always hide out in a lead-lined 1950s fridge 
(sorry, I really hated CRYSTAL SKULL&hellip;)</p> </li>

but zi wouldnt want to see either destroyed!</p> </li> 
<li> March 25th, 2012 at 10:15 am Joe G says: 
<p>It has clearly become a popularity contest, but it is actually about who 
would survive longer in a zombie apocalypse, so it should neither be a battle 
between the two nor a popularity contest, if you actually read what the contest 
is about. Popularity contests are BORING and vs battles have been done to 
death. Come on people!</p> </li> 
<li> March 24th, 2012 at 7:35 pm Goblin King says: 
<p>1st round was a wash, most the winners are ridiculous. Sauron, Optimus 
Prime, Superman, and Wonder Woman were very clear winners in their round one 
brackets. Does anybody on this forum know who Red Skull is? A strong Pokemon 
would beat him&hellip;</p> </li>

<p>It is unfortunate that some (probably more) view this and vote as if it 
were a popularity contest. Unfortunately, that&rsquo;s what it is. But make no 
doubt about it, by no means is this contest&rsquo;s intention to be a 
popularity contest. Look at the top of the page and you&rsquo;ll read, 
&ldquo;Which iconic character has the stuff to defeat the Agents of Armageddon 
predicted to descend upon us this year?&rdquo; What it&rsquo;s not saying is, 
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s discover which character would win a geeky beauty contest 
just before the world ended in 2012!&rdquo; It&rsquo;s a &ldquo;versus,&rdquo; 
not a pageant. These are fun, yes, but they are the fun hypotheticals of 
&ldquo;who would win in a fight&rdquo; that you&rsquo;d normally have with your 
buddy. This one happens to be on a larger scale.</p> 
<p>And clearly Batman&rsquo;s got this.</p> </li>

<p>Exactly how are we supposed to judge this then? What criteria are we 
supposed to use?</p> 
<p>If it is NOT by how we know the characters and what they are capable of, 
but rather this &lsquo;fun&rsquo; element, what point is there?</p> 
<p>You could pit and ant against SUPERMAN and have the ant win..it would make 
just as much sense as some of the results we are seeing here.</p> </li> 
<li> March 23rd, 2012 at 4:53 pm tank0211 says: 
<p>This is not about who &lsquo;should&rsquo; technically win people! 
It&rsquo;s a fun popularity contest to go along w/ the NCAA tourney. So for all 
you over-charged nerds screaming &lsquo;NO WAY&rsquo; get over it already &amp; 
have some fun voting for your favorite characters!</p> </li>

<p>How can Indy beat Wonder Woman and now be winning against Wolverine? Indy 
would not last one second in an apocalyptic zombie infected world, he&rsquo;s 
afraid of snakes. Indy VS Wolverine now come on lets be real, Wolverine would 
take care of him in less than a second. To all X-men fans lets do what is 
right. Wolverine is the man.</p> </li> 
<li> March 23rd, 2012 at 8:31 am Queso6p4 says: 
<p>Some of these winners don&rsquo;t make any sense. Indy won against Wonder 
Woman? Really? Darth Maul against Lord Voldermort? As much as I like Maul I 
doubt his lightsaber can repel spells. That being said, it&rsquo;s all in fun 
and I look forward to seeing who wins.</p> </li> 
<li> March 23rd, 2012 at 1:12 am Daron Woodward says: 
<p>It&rsquo;s a great shame that there has been no small amount of deliberate 
&lsquo;spoiling&rsquo; going on.</p> 
<p>ANY normal human against a SUPERHUMAN is going to lose, easy as, no matter 
how wiley or well tooled-up that human&rsquo;s belt might be (and this from an 
mad BATMAN fan), or handy with a whip they are.</p> 
<p>Shame.</p> </li>

<p>How Indy beat Wonder Woman to begin with is ridiculous enough, but 
Wolverine?! Hey, I like Indy as much as anyone, but at some point logic has to 
be applied, yes? Same thing with Ripley vs. Spidey. How does any normal human 
female have even the slightest of chances against a person who has super 
agility, &ldquo;spider sense&rdquo;, web shooters, AND can lift 10 tons? 
That&rsquo;s right. None.</p> </li>

 Deadpool said it best in response to Cain

which he retorts, &ldquo;Nothing? Plenty stops the Juggernaut! The X-Men, the 
Hulk, Spider-Man&hellip;twice!&rdquo;</p> </li> 
<li> March 20th, 2012 at 10:00 pm Scott says: 
<p>Would Superman totally trash Megatron in a fight? The correct answer is: 
Yes, within seconds. Now that the obvious has been established, Gen.Zod would 
do the *exact* same thing. Probably faster due to the ruthless factor. Sorry,
