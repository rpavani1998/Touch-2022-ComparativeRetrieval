<title>Great Comic Book Quotables</title>

 &nbsp; <br>
<i>I originally posted this piece at the webzine, PopCultureShock 
-- where it proved remarkably popular. In fact, months after it was first 
posted, it was still getting more hits per week than some newer articles and 
reviews! So I've decided to re-present it here, slightly modified. Some new 
quotes have been added, older ones given greater context, and a few pics have 
been added...</i> 
<p><i>Added maybe a dozen quotes throughout the various categories -&nbsp; 
April 2010</i> </p> 
<p><b><i>Great Comic Book Quotables</i></b> <br>
<b><i>- quotes, quotations, 
and bon mots</i></b> </p> 
<p>&quot;To be or not to be...&quot;, &quot;It was the best of times...&quot;, 
&quot;This boy is Ignorance. This girl is Want...&quot;, &quot;The problems of 
three people don't amount to a hill of beans in this crazy world...&quot; and 
so on. When people quote books, movies and TV, it's a form of legitimization. 
If it's worth repeating, it must be worth knowing in the first place. But what 
of comics?</p> 
<p>To consider the respectability, and value, of comics, let's delve whole 
heartedly into that epitomy of pop intellectualism...the quote (or quotes). 
What wisdom can be milked from comics, that most maligned of mediums? I first 
posted this a few years ago (adding to it over time) and recently was looking 
over some similiar pages and message boards where others compiled their own 
favourite four colour sayings. But often these were the &quot;cool&quot; lines, 
or the witty quip, and sometimes lines which, I'll confess, seemed to have 
little resonance if you didn't know the character and the scene to begin with. 
I've certainly included some of those myself here, but what I was more 
interested in was the powerful quote, the provocative musing.</p> 
<p>I broke the list up into categories, just to make it more digestible. But, 
let's face it, the placing can be pretty arbitrary in some cases (I've moved 
quotes from one section to another -- and back -- unsure where it best 
belonged).</p> 
<p>So, without further ado, may I present Great Quotations of Western Thought 
-- the Funnybooks Version:</p> 
<p> </p> <br>
<b>_______Responsibility</b> 
<p>With great power there must also come -- great responsibility! (perhaps the 
most famous phrase of the Silver Age of comics, and, arguably, it redefined the 
narrative focus of the entire genre...or, as actor Nicholas Cage said, when 
presenting Stan Lee with a lifetime achievement award, it's a phrase that can 
raise an ordinary man up to the level of a hero...or bring a hero down to the 
level of an ordinary man.&nbsp; It was first expressed in a narrative caption 
(not by his uncle as it was in the movie) in Spider-Man's debut in<i>Amazing 
Fantasy</i> #15, Stan Lee) </p> 
<p>****** <br>
<br>
&quot;We are responsible for each other. That's part of 
being human -- isn't it?&quot; (Robin re-iterating a similar &quot;brother's 
keeper&quot; theme, though on a more personal level, after Batman denies 
responsibility for Catwoman's nervous breakdown -- a sentiment Batman would 
come to recognize by issue's end -- &quot;Never Scratch a Cat&quot;<i>Batman</i>
 #355, Gerry Conway)</p> 
<p>****** </p> 
<p>&quot;You've been so full of vindictive, self-righteous wrath that you've 
forgotten one little thing; you killed this man's wife and child! If Fate is 
insane, if &quot;Sunshine&quot; is dead -- it's your fault!&quot; (Super hero 
Devil Slayer was a reformed mob hit man, but when Fate, a man whose wife and 
child Devil-Slayer had inadvertently killed, comes after him for revenge, it's 
the people around Devil-Slayer who suffer -- including a junkie Devil Slayer 
had been trying to rehabilitate named &quot;Sunshine&quot;. It took guest star 
Wonder Man, in the above dialogue, to remind Devil-Slayer that culpability 
doesn't end just 'cause we want it to -- &quot;Yesterday Never Dies!&quot;<i>
The Defenders</i>, 1st series, #104, J.M. DeMatteis) </p> 
<p> </p> <br>
<b>________War &amp; Consequences</b> <br>
&nbsp;

aftermath of a conflict between the Green Lantern Corps and the Weaponers of 
Qward -- &quot;Battleground: Oa!&quot;<i>Green Lantern</i>, 1st Silver Age 
series, #127, Denny O'Neil)</p> 
<p>***** </p> 
<p>&quot;No good has ever come of a Holy War, and never will!&quot; (Superman 
chastising some Christian and Jewish kids fighting over religious differences 
-- though the kids make up by agreeing to aall go off and watch A Christmas 
Carol together, suggesting the writer may've missed the nuances of the conflict 
himself! -- &quot;The War for Peace&quot;,<i>Action Comics</i> #517, Gerry 
Conway)</p> 
<p> <br>
****** </p> 
<p>&quot;I got a look at some of our Japanese-American relocation centers, 
back during the Big One. Saw what they do to men -- on both sides of the barbed 
wire.&quot; (Nick Fury explaining why he allowed traitor-by-association, the 
alien Captain Marvel, to escape -- &quot;All Things Must End!&quot;<i>Avengers

<p>***** </p> 
<p>&quot;We didn't mean it! We never mean it! But what good does that 
do...&quot; (Vietnam veteran Flash Thompson, having second thoughts about the 
war in Southeast Asia and its impact on the Vietnemese -- &quot;Enter: Dr. 
Strange!&quot;<i>Amazing Spider-Man</i>, 1st series, #109, Stan Lee) </p> 
<p>***** </p> 
<p>&quot;I'll never forget the Death Star...but I'll never forget the day 
after it, either.&quot; (Luke Skywalker battles a storm trooper in the 
aftermath of the destruction of the Death Star, only to discover that, beneath 
the impersonal mask, lies a boy no older than himself.&nbsp; Not a radical 
scene, but it spoke more about&nbsp; the reality of war in a single comicbook 
than in any of George Lucas' multi-billion dollar grossing motion pictures -- 
&quot;The Day After the Death Star&quot;<i>Star Wars, Marvel Illustrated Book
</i>, vol. 1, Archie Goodwin) <br>
&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp; </p> 
<p> </p> <br>
<b>________Right &amp; Wrong</b> 
<p>&quot;In this world, there is right and there is wrong, and that 
distinction is not difficult to make.&quot;(Superman making, arguably, an 
oversimplification...but, damn!, it makes sense --<i>Kingdom Come</i> #3, Mark 
Waid, but paraphrasing a phrase written by Elliot S! Maggin in the novel 
Superman, The Last Son of Krypton...and maybe elsewhere)</p> 
<p>****** </p>

<p>****** </p> 
<p>&quot;What you say is reasonable, logical, justifiable. But does that make

lethal force...and you can bet Marvel doesn't O.K. such critiques of their 
feral cash cow<i>these</i> days -- &quot;Rage&quot; <i>Uncanny X-Men</i> #140, 
1st series, Chris Claremont)</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p><b>________Truth</b> <br>
&nbsp; </p> 
<p>&quot;(Truth) is a subjective concept, one to be accepted or rejected 
depending on the viewer's prejudices&quot; (villain Thanos -- &quot;How Strange 
My Destiny&quot;<i>Warlock, 1st series,</i> #11, Jim Starlin) </p> 
<p>****** </p>

is right. When the time's done, you're back where you started -- alone.&quot;(A 
philosophical member oof the conspiracy -- &quot;A Little Dream of Me&quot;<i>
The X-Files</i>, Topps series, #3, Stefan Petrucha) </p> 
<p>****** </p> 
<p>&quot;The news isn't there to tell you what happened. It's there to tell 
you what it wants you to hear, or what it thinks you want to hear. They already 
have their stories worked out. They just wait for events to fill in the blanks. 
When they don't fit, they get sidelined or twisted till they do.&quot;(Cyclops 
-- &quot;Dangerous, Chap. 1&quot;<i>Astonishing X-Men</i> #7, Joss Whedon) </p>

<p>&quot;Are arbitrary labels more important than the way we live our lives, 
what we're supposed to be more important than what we actually are?&quot; 
(Cyclops in the graphic novel<i>X-Men: God Loves, Man Kills</i>, Chris 
Claremont)</p> 
<p>****** </p> 
<p>&quot;We paid our fare just like anyone else!&quot; (mutant Cyclops again, 
responding to the dirty looks the X-Men are receiving from fellow, human, 
commuters on a subway; it's the very mundanity of the scene that makes it as 
chillingly pointed as any of the high end, hysterical &quot;mutant 
prejudice&quot; scenes the X-Men face these days -- &quot;Trapped: One 
X-Man!&quot;<i>X-Men</i>, 1st series, #5, Stan Lee) </p> 
<p>****** </p> 
<p>&quot;I been readin' about you...how you work for the Blue Skins...and how 
on a planet someplace you helped out the Orange Skins...and you've done 
considerable for the Purple Skins! Only there's skins you never bothered with

Lantern, as DC Comics tried to grown up with the times...and maybe acknowledge 
that sometimes &quot;metaphors&quot; like orange skinned aliens have to give 
way to literal issues -- &quot;No Evil Shall Escape My Sight!&quot;,<i>Green 
Lantern</i>, 1st Silver Age series, #76, Denny O'Neil) <br>
&nbsp; </p> 
<p> </p> <br>
<b>________Philosophy in a Nut Shell</b> 
<p>&quot;Do you suppose they finally understood...that a man who can inspire 
laughter...and joy...is the holiest man of all?&quot; (guest star Ayla, in what 
could be an eulogy for entertainers everywhere; actually I could literally 
quote almost the entire issue, it's<i>that </i>good -- &quot;And Then I 
Died&quot;<i>Man-Thing</i>, 1st series, #6, Steve Gerber) </p>

<p>&quot;Every time a man raises his hand against his neighbour in the name of

<p>****** </p> 
<p>&quot;..that is the decision all lovers must make -- whether their

<p>&quot;Maybe it was just you, all the time!&quot; (I was never much 
impressed with this gritty story wherein the Joker attempts to prove anyone can 
be driven insane -- as he was -- by the right circumstances...and fails. But I

life is more authentic than anyone else's -- <i>Batman: The 
Killing Joke</i>, Alan Moore) </p>

left!&quot; (Superman responding to the question as to whether hate is all his 
foe -- and childhood friend -- Lex Luthor ever had? -- And I probably shouldn't 
include it as a comic book quote, since writer Elliot S! Maggin was borrowing

<p>&quot;Life is cruel, Nick. It feeds on your ambitions and enthusiasms -- 
and uses them to destroy you.&quot;(SScorpio, a <i>very</i> depressed 
super-villain, contemplating life's iniquities in a powerful, brilliant closing 
scene -- &quot;Scorpio Must Die!&quot;<i>The Defenders</i>, 1st series, #50,

<p>..and... </p> 
<p>&quot;All my life, every time I've ever believed in anything, or had faith 
the future would get better for me, I've had that false hope knocked out of 
me...and found myself back on my knees in despair.&quot;(Scorpio again, same 
scene, same issue; a word to aspiring comic writers, or to pros who want to 
better themselves: read the final, two page scene of this issue. That's all I 
can say. Just<i>read</i> it. In fact, the whole Who Remembers Scorpio story 
line is discussed in myThey Ain't Trade Paperbacks section -- <i>The Defenders
</i> #50) </p>

<p>&quot;The people who had custody of the American dream had abused both it 
and us. There was no way I could keep calling myself &quot;Captain 
America&quot;, because the others who acted in America's name were every bit as 
bad...as...the...Red...Skull!&quot;(Captain America deals with the Watergate 
Scandal (metaphorically) in his comic, renouncing his identity for a time, 
becoming &quot;Nomad&quot; instead: here he explains why -- &quot;Nomad: No

<p>..and... </p> 
<p>&quot;Whatever the threat -- wherever it originates -- I won't be blind 
again!&quot;(Captain America, same scene, same issue, realizing that evil must 
be confronted, even when it exists in places you'd rather not find it, like 
cherished institutions; Cap's entire closing monologue is worth reading, but it 
would take most of this article to repeat it --<i>Captain America</i> #183,

<p>So there you go, a very informal, highly selective, conspicuously biased 
sampling of quotes. So what've we learned? That underneath the hitting and 
smashing, a theme of super hero comics is responsibility, for your own actions, 
and to your fellow man (so pick up some canned goods next time you're grocery 
shopping and drop 'em off in the Food Bank bin). Wars may not always be 
avoidable, but they sure suck. Prejudice sucks, too.</p> 
<p>I've omitted lots of great quotes and great writers but, hey, I've got 
deadlines. Still, any of the above worth studying in English class? Anything 
worth putting on a T-Shirt? Who knows?</p>
