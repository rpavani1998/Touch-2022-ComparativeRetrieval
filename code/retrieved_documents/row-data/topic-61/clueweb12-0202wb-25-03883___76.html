<p>Is this Protoss race the ones that fought the elite zealots? I don&rsquo;t 
know much about either, but I assume that since the elders are from WH40k 
they&rsquo;ll most likely win. Everything from WH40k is overpowered.</p> </li>

<p>considering eldar can summon avatars of war and the like they should win in 
groundbattle &hellip; otherwise it should somewhat even &hellip; protoss have 
nearly every unit with shileding and strong psykers &hellip; eldar have very 
specialised units and psykers on ther own</p> </li>

<p>Whoo hoo first post on factpile.Will the protoss get their new units in 
heart of the swarm in the battle eg, the tempest,the replicant and the 
oracle?And if the protoss get those units will they get to keep the mothership 
and the carrier?</p> </li>

<p>&ldquo;For this battle, the Protoss are at the height of their power,

 -<br>
 The thing about this is that 
what counts as Protoss at the height of their power?<br>
 -<br>
 Is it before 
the Dark Templars split off?<br>
 -<br>
 Is it just prior to Starcraft 1, 
before they had suffered major losses to the Zerg?<br>
 -<br>
 Or is it the 
most recent incarnation where they arguably have far better tech?</p> </li>

<p>Don&rsquo;t be so quick to count the Protoss out in ground combat. The 
basic grunt Protoss infantry unit is a power armor wearing telepathic precog 
with psi-blades and psichically powered personal plasma shields rated at above 
58 Mj at the low end, and above 388 Mj at the high end (a full clip of Terran 
marine C-14 rounds doesn&rsquo;t take it down, the calcs are for the smaller 
250 round clip and mach 5 rounds for the low end, and the larger 500 round clip 
and mach 10 rounds for the high end). These Zealots are also capable of 
momentarily turn their body into pure energy, allowing them brief bursts of 
literal &ldquo;lightning speed&rdquo; they use to close the distance to their 
opponents-<br>
<i>&ldquo;For more than a thousand years, the Protoss of the 
Templar caste have defended their people, dedicating their long lives to the 
pursuit of martial perfection. Zealots are peerless warriors who have yet to 
ascend to the uppermost ranks of the Khala. Ever eager for advancement, they 
train for decades in hand-to-hand combat, tactics, pain tolerance, and martial 
discipline. Their formidable physiques are further enhanced by cybernetic 
implants and power suits. Zealots use their substantial psionic abilities to 
create blades of pure energy that serve as their primary melee weapons.&rdquo;
</i><br>
 -http://eu.battle.net/sc2/en/game/unit/zealot<br>
 .<br>
 High 
Templars would also prove problematic on the battlefield- their regular combat 
capabilities are greater than those of Zealots (as the High Templars rise from 
the Zealot&rsquo;s ranks), and their psichic powers are sufficient so that in 
fluff just one of their number was able to bring down a squadron of Terran 
Battlecruisers with a psichic storm-<br>
<i>&ldquo;The High Templar are the 
most seasoned warriors of the Protoss armies, an elite cadre who have advanced 
far beyond the Zealots to attain an even higher plane of martial focus. 
Although they excel in physical combat, High Templar prefer to use psionic 
attacks that they have developed through intensive training. The Protoss have 
such powerful psionic abilities that their presence inadvertently disrupts 
other life-forms. With careful guidance, High Templar can learn to augment this 
effect, creating storms of raw psionic energy that can tear apart the minds of 
lesser species.&rdquo;</i><br>
 
-http://eu.battle.net/sc2/en/game/unit/high-templar<br>
 .<br>
 And of course, 
the Dark Templars-<br>
<i>&ldquo;The Dark Templar are powerful psionic warriors 
whose ancestors resettled on the planet Shakuras after they were exiled from 
the Protoss homeworld of Aiur for refusing to join the emerging Khala, the 
communal mind link shared by the entire race. In place of the Khala&rsquo;s 
bright energies, the Dark Templar learned to manipulate the darker powers of 
the Void, which gave the Dark Templar the ability to become invisible at will. 
Armed with their potent Warp Blades, the Dark Templar are deadly and relentless 
foes capable of devastating conventional forces. Now that Aiur has fallen and 
its refugees have fled to Shakuras, the Dark Templar have joined their 
considerable strength to the Protoss&rsquo; numbers.&rdquo;</i><br>
 
-http://eu.battle.net/sc2/en/game/unit/dark-templar<br>
 .<br>
 Keep in mind 
that Starcraft Psionics completely ignore tensile strength, affecting neosteel 
just as well as it affects glass.<br>
 .<br>
 If the situation becomes 
particularly dire, two or more High Templars could join to form Archons, 
who&rsquo;s psichic power&rsquo;s are orders of magnitude greater, if short 
lived-<br>
<i>&ldquo;Although their abilities are already impressive, High 
Templar and Dark Templar can wield even greater might by laying down their 
lives to merge their souls and form Archons. These unified Protoss spirits 
radiate incalculable power, unleashing psionic barrages against cowering enemy 
forces both in the air and on the ground. With the reunification of the Protoss 
race, any pair of High Templar or Dark Templar, or even one of each, can be 
fused together. The Protoss are loath to sacrifice their loyal warriors, but 
those who make this final commitment are forever honored in the memories of 
their people.&rdquo;</i><br>
 -http://eu.battle.net/sc2/en/game/unit/archon<br>

 .<br>
 The Protoss also possess powerful robotic war machines- the Colossi. 
These towering machines can carve through even Protoss armies with frighting 
ease- in fluff each sweep of their thermal lances vaporizes anything in 
it&rsquo;s path without slowing down, be it Dark Templars, Zealots or even 
entire structures-<br>
<i>&ldquo;The towering Colossus is a Protoss robot 
design dating back to the bloody conflicts of the Kalath Intercession. It 
strides across the battlefield on four tall, slender legs that allow it to 
cross steep elevations with ease. The Colossus&rsquo; heavily armored hull 
carries two powerful Thermal Lances, with one on each side of its body. The 
robot&rsquo;s beam attack cuts a broad swath across its targets, making the 
Colossus an ideal anti-infantry weapon. Unlike most other Protoss robots, the 
Colossus was created purely for destruction. Manufacturing Colossi has been 
outlawed for centuries, but the increasingly desperate war against the Zerg has 
forced the Protoss to revive the line.&rdquo;</i><br>
 
-http://eu.battle.net/sc2/en/game/unit/colossus<br>
 .<br>
 Height of power for 
the Protoss would be back when they were sending out their great fleets 
everywhere, led by their motherships-<br>
<i>&ldquo;During the golden age of 
Protoss expansion, Motherships led vast armadas throughout deep space. In the 
centuries since, these primary command ships had departed the field of battle 
and become holy shrines, venerated by mystics and historians. But the loss of 
Aiur has convinced the Protoss to resurrect their oldest and most powerful 
weapons. All Motherships hold a huge khaydarin crystal infused with enough 
psionic energy to distort the very fabric of time and space. When wielding this 
force, these vessels can instantly destroy squadrons of enemy ships or even 
entire planets.&rdquo;</i><br>
 
-http://eu.battle.net/sc2/en/game/unit/mothership<br>
 .<br>
 Their fleets 
themselves are made up mostly of carriers-<br>
<i>&ldquo;The massive Carriers 
serve as operation centers for leaders of the Protoss fleet. Heavily armored 
and shielded, Carriers can punch their way through enemy blockades by 
unleashing flights of robotic Interceptors. Interceptors are maneuverable, 
computer-guided crafts that can tear through flight formations and relentlessly 
strafe slower ground targets with their plasma charges. Interceptors are 
automatically manufactured and serviced inside of the Carriers&rsquo; bays, and 
a number of prepped Interceptors can be launched in rapid succession. In 
battle, Carriers appear to be virtual hornet&rsquo;s nests of activity as their 
small allies dart swiftly in and out, alternating between attacking enemies and 
repairing damage. &ldquo;</i><br>
 
-http://eu.battle.net/sc2/en/game/unit/carrier<br>
 .<br>
 Not all carriers 
rely solely on their interceptor fleets however. Many of these massive vessels 
are armed with powerful beam weapons, and a fleet of Protoss carriers can 
employ said beam weapons to eradicate all life on the face of an Earthlike 
planet in seconds- cracking open it&rsquo;s mantle like an egg and allowing 
oceans of magma to drown it&rsquo;s surface and evicting it&rsquo;s atmosphere 
with the force of the blasts.<br>
 .<br>
 The Protoss population is fairly 
small, stated to be in the billions spread over an interstellar empire, but not 
elaborated on beyond that. However, the size of the Protoss industrial capacity 
and military are far beyond what could be expected from their population thanks 
the the complete automation of their industry, their ability to teleport whole 
structures across interstellar distances, their reliance on robotic labor and 
war machines and the low crew requirements of their ships.<br>
 .<br>
 The 
Protoss also tend to suffer very few casualties in battle, as their suits 
automatically teleport them to the nearest medical facility upon critical 
injury or system failure.<br>

<p>Protoss armour and shields can likely laugh off Eldar Shuriken rounds. Most 
everyone else can after all. However, as we get to the bigger weapons, 
there&rsquo;s a marked increase in power output and destructive potential.</p> 
<p>D-Cannons particularly don&rsquo;t rely on armour penetration, so much as 
tearing a hole in space and letting the gravitational pull of a warp rift tear 
their foes into pieces, or else suck them into a different realm.</p> 
<p>I&rsquo;m hoping someone with &ldquo;Path of the Warrior &rdquo; will turn 
up and drop some calculatable feats for us, because the Eldar are woefully 
under-represented.</p> 
<p>Honestly, my first instinct is to say the Protoss take this. Their 
psychicness is much more offensively devastating, at least from what i&rsquo;ve 
seen thus far.</p> </li>

<p>Jwlynas makes a good point. Nearly all Eldar basic &lsquo;projectile&rsquo; 
weapons are based on very, very sharp things moving very fast. As dangerous as 
that is, against shields it doesn&rsquo;t matter how sharp the object is. 
Unless the shurikans (and these monofilimant things the Dark Reapers shoot) 
have a large enough mass that sharpness will be useless against Protoss shields 
to a very large degree.<br>

 Though I would ask you Galorian if you know 
how big the Protoss empire actually is? And how they travel through space?</p>

far(among other 40K factions barring the likes of the IoM, Forces of Chaos or 
the Nids, since those 3 factions are too big on their own to fight off!)

entire crew. &ldquo;We need to land the ship. Now!&rdquo;<br>
 Zoraya 
accelerated into the asteroid field, swerving expertly to avoid numerous 
meteors and planetoids. The proximity beacon began to flash enthusiastically on 
the viewscreen as the ship&rsquo;s destination, a hollowed tooth of an 
asteroid, spun closer into view. With a swift corkscrew spin, Zoraya drove the 
vessel toward the center of the rock and stopped just above the surface. She 
was readying the landing gear when a sudden observation made her pause.&rdquo;

<p>I&rsquo;m not sure that the Warp Drives are &ldquo;light-years away&rdquo; 
as opposed to &ldquo;instant travel.&rdquo; In the Dark Templar saga, the ships 
made &ldquo;jumps&rdquo; or something like that. I&rsquo;ll find a quote if I 
can, but if someone else could mention it, that&rsquo;d be great.</p> </li>

<p>So what kind of firepower does the Eldar posses in space? Because as most 
of you know, Protoss ship firepower is easily in the teraton or higher range 
judging from screenshots of how they &lsquo;purify&rsquo; planets.</p> </li>

 Since Elder ships have to fight off Imperium ships, which are 
said to pack petaton per volley and shields of similar strength, I would think 
its somewhere in that range for the Elders.</p>

<br> That is true, but I&rsquo;m pretty sure the attacks they have to glass a 
planet are different than ship-to-ship weapons. I could be wrong, but my point 
is that ship-to-ship is never shown in the range of the planet-busters.</p>

 The quotes I saw for Protoss say there weapons go through the 
crust and cause all the magma to come up and burn the planet, or something like 
that. I&rsquo;ll go over the Tau vs Protoss thread and find the quote.</p> </li>

Protoss are preparing to glass a planet.<br>
 -<br>
 &ldquo;There is a Protoss 
fleet in orbit and they are charging up their main weapons.&rsquo;<br>
 -<br>
 
Unless we are assuming they only use their &lsquo;main weapon&rsquo; for 
purification. It&rsquo;s not something like a technobabble exterminatus weapon.

<p>I think most Eldar ships only manage to fight Imperial ships because 
they&rsquo;re so fast and difficult to target because of their holofields, not 
to mention their maneuverability can keep them out of most Imperial ship firing 
arcs during a fight.</p> </li>

 Well, that&rsquo;s handy. I would 
doubt, however, that after the first volley the main weapons would be close to 
the planet-glassing level, seeing as they had a charge-up time for such 
strength.</p> </li>

 &ldquo;Maneuvering

That&rsquo;s fast.&rdquo;<br>
 -<br>
 Doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean so.<br>
 -
<br> I read the previous few pages and the next few to get some context for 
that and it is clear that whoever wrote that has no understanding of science 
whatsoever.<br>
 -<br>
 1.) The previous page, 6, the sun is decribed as nearly 
being depleted and only able to emit a thin red light. If the sun was nearly 
depleted it would either be massive and red (still emiting large amounts of red 
light), gone supernova or shrunken into a brown dwarf or a neutron star.<br>
 -
<br> 2.) Meteors don&rsquo;t exist in asteroid fields. Meteoroids do. 
It&rsquo;s only a semantic difference but it all points towards ignorance.<br>
 
-<br>
 3.) Planetoids are hundreds of kilometres wide. You do not swerve to 
avoid them, you plot a course that avoids them well in advance, it&rsquo;s not 
like they sneak up on you.<br>
 -<br>
 Also no time frame or distances are 
given, so trying to draw solid conclusions from that error ridden segment is 
hopeless.</p> </li>

 Even if that were so, fluff plainly states

<br> .<br>
 The maneuvering took place while the guy was holding off a bunch of 
Zerg inside the ship. It had to be a matter of seconds. Distances are indeed 
too vague, but this still speaks of very high velocities and maneuverability, 
as well as piloting skill and reaction time, to do that without plotting a 
pre-calculated course.</p> </li>

<p>Heres that quote about the planet &ldquo;glassing&rdquo;</p> 
<p>&ldquo;The aliens laid down a withering barrage against the planet beneath.
<br> Where the energy beams struck, they burned. The sky itself curdled as the 
beams pierced through the atmospheric envelope. Air itself was torn away from 
the planet by the force of the blows.<br>
 And where the beams struck the 
surface, they erupted, boiling the ground where they struck, uprooting both the 
creep-infested lands and those that had not yet been infected. Deadly rainbow 
radiation, more brilliant than Mike had ever seen, spiraled out from the impact 
points, churning earth and water mercilessly, distorting the matter of the 
planet itself.<br>
 Then other ships began firing thinner beams with surgical 
accuracy, adding to the barrage in places. The cities, Mike realized. They were 
targeting the cities and making sure that nothing could survive there. Any 
place of human settlement. Including, he knew, the Jacobs Installation itself.
<br> They had cut their timing very close indeed, he thought, and his stomach 
gave an uneasy lurch.<br>
 One of the pulsing beams punched through the crust 
itself, and the ground erupted in a volcanic upwelling. Magma pushed to the 
surface, consuming everything that had been uprooted by the energy beams. Most 
of the world&rsquo;s atmosphere was burning now, torn away from the orb in a 
veil that trailed it in orbit, and what was left spiraled in hurricanes and 
tornadoes, until destroyed by more beams.<br>
 Now red volcanic glows covered 
the northern hemisphere of Mar Sara like welts. The remainder of the land 
heaved in a deadly rainbow. Nothing could survive the assault, human or 
otherwise.<br>
 &ldquo;Exterminators,&rdquo; said Mike softly. 
&ldquo;They&rsquo;re cosmic exterminators.&rdquo;<br>

 I would like the Protoss to win this one. 
What I am trying to avoid, though, is a load of wank. If all of these claims 
are true, I am fine with that. I am just trying to make sure they ARE true.</p>

<p>The Protoss may win this.<br>
 At their current state of power the Eldar 
are a shattered empire. While their ships and mechs a freaky fast and strong 
and their specialty troops are good, there is not really a lot of them left, 
and most of their gods are shattered(like Khaine) or destroyed (like Asuryan) 
or relatively weak(like the Laughing God).<br>
 It&rsquo;s one empire at 
it&rsquo;s height against another at it&rsquo;s lowest possible point.</p> </li>

 I don&rsquo;t know much about the Elder, but I think when they 
were made they were meant to defeat Chaos, so I figured that Elder at the 
height of their power would just ROFL stomp the Protoss, current seemed more 
fair.</p>

 Most of the eldar&rsquo;s gods are dead or missing at this 
point.Besides the eldar created one of the four primary chaos god during their 
downfall meaning that not only will the eldar have the deal with the protoss 
but they will have to deal with Slaanesh at the same time.</p> </li>

 A few things are wrong in his analysis-<br>
 .<br>
 1) 
First off, the Dominion officially switched over to depleted uranium spikes, as 
opposed to the less conformed Confederacy era C-14 ammo. Even before that DU 
was stated to be the most popular variant. The rounds are stated to be neosteel 
tipped however, which could confuse some people.<br>
 .<br>
 2) The dimensions 
he used for the rounds are far shorter than the magazine implies. Judging by 
the size of the mags each spike is around 150mm long (which is consistent with 
the length/width ratio of modern day sabot rounds and with the fact that the 
spikes are said to nail Zerg to walls).<br>
 .<br>
 3) The C-14 is designed to 
over-penetrate and everything is made of future-metals, so trying to gauge 
it&rsquo;s power from it&rsquo;s performance is pointless.</p> </li>

<p>&ldquo;How about these Elder gods, how useful would they be?&rdquo;<br>
 
-The two in my immediate memory are Khaine who is the god behind the Avatars of 
Khaine, because he was shattered when he pissed off the King of the Eldar 
gods(who is now dead, killed by the Chaos Gods). And The Laughing God is the 
Loki of the Eldar Gods, and is represented by the Harlequin Troupes (shadow 
seers, death jesters, etc.). Over all they are fairly strong, however 
Khaine&rsquo;s useless outside of his Avatars, And the LG is just a trickster. 
The LG is the reason Khaine is in pieces.</p> </li>

<p>&ldquo;Unless we are assuming they only use their &lsquo;main weapon&rsquo; 
for purification. It&rsquo;s not something like a technobabble exterminatus 
weapon.&rdquo;<br>
 -<br>
 If a fleet in orbit must charge the weapons, we 
either assume for some reason it&rsquo;s not part of the Protoss standard 
operations to charge before arriving at a battle zone, or it takes them a long 
time to charge their weapons. Either way it also sounds like they probably 
engage in battle with out charging their weapons up to this point regularly. 
It&rsquo;d be a good idea to find out how long it takes the Protoss to charge 
up. They probably can use their planet glassing technique on other ships but 
the time it takes to be able to do this makes it so that their ships would be 
more like tank destroyers trying to fight tanks due to the lack of grace in 
this fighting style. Taking time of arrival to how long until they fire seems 
to be the best route, with Zero Seconds = Zero Energy and X level of seconds 
having passed til they fire = Glassing a planet. You can simply divide to find 
a direct percentage to figure out how long it would take them to charge up to 
the level needed to hurt an Eldar ship.</p> </li>

 &ldquo;powering weapons&rdquo; is a standard 
sci-fi description for meaning business, it doesn&rsquo;t really imply anything.
<br> .<br>
 This makes sense actually- no one goes around with a chambered 
round in his weapon unless he&rsquo;s in a combat situation, and the same goes 
for any other weapon out there (save some kinds of missile tubes). Doing 
otherwise is just an accident waiting to happen.<br>
 .<br>
 Furthermore, 
Prepping a weapon for fire is done differently in a combat situation that 
it&rsquo;s done under safer conditions- My battalion can prep and fire an 
artillery round very quickly during an emergency or when simulating combat 
using dud ammo, but when not pressed and dealing with live ammunition (such as 
when preforming live fire during an exercise) the safety checks alone can take 
hours. Hell, we once had to cancel a live fire exercise because by the time the 
safety checks were done it was dark and the higher-ups preferred not to risk 
it&hellip;<br>
 .<br>
 Same principle applies to any other weapon to varying 
degrees. In the case of the Protoss ship mounted directed energy weapons 
they&rsquo;d probably give them greater safety margins on the charge up 
sequence, double check everything, wait for the entire fleet to be ready and 
finally stand by for the Executor&rsquo;s express fire command before pushing 
the big red button. After all, that was a coordinated fleet action and the 
planet wasn&rsquo;t going anywhere&hellip;</p> </li>

mainly refugees.<br>

 I can&rsquo;t say much about either side&rsquo;s

that seems mainly &ldquo;united&rdquo; is better than a bunch of refugees. Did

<p>Protoss tech is crazy advanced. Their crystals are both their computers and 
their power source, and are amazing in both respects.<br>
 .<br>
 During Wings 
of Liberty your science guy has you collect fragments of such crystals 
throughout the game and studies them over time. Over the course of the campaign 
the crystal in the lab gradually repairs itself and &ldquo;evolves&rdquo;-<br>
 
.<br>
<i>&ldquo;&rdquo;Protoss &ldquo;crystal&rdquo; sample recovered by 
Raynor&rsquo;s Raiders, 10.7.2504.<br>
 .<br>
 I placed the crystal in saline 
solution for storage. Its density has increased 533% in the last twelve hours. 
Where does it get energy or raw materials for that? I have a terrible suspicion 
that it&rsquo;s&hellip; connecting to the ship somehow. If Swann suspects, 
he&rsquo;ll drop it out the airlock, and that would be a tragedy. This sample 
could lead to huge breakthroughs for the Raiders.<br>
 I Just have to be 
careful, and if there&rsquo;s any sign that it will harm the Hyperion, 
I&rsquo;ll destroy the crystal myself.&rdquo;</i><br>
 -1st Research note<br>
 .
<br> <i>&ldquo;The crystal is growing, and it appears to have 
something&ndash;some sort of&hellip; anti-matter? Gravitational anomaly? 
Non-standard phenomenon?&ndash;hovering over it. I&rsquo;m now convinced that 
the crystal is drawing power from the ship, but in ways so subtle as to be 
undetectable.<br>
 .<br>
 It is non-organic but has a molecular structure as 
diverse and complex as any organism&rsquo;s. It&rsquo;s developed an intricate 
matrix that makes it tough and surprisingly flexible. An alloy based on this 
crystal would have impressive damage mitigation. The structure of this matrix 
also suggests some sort of energy-storage system. There might be something to 
this.<br>
 The protoss are so far beyond us. We must seem amoeboid to 
them.&rdquo;</i><br>
 -2nd Research note<br>
 .<br>
<i>&ldquo;The protoss 
crystal continues to grow. I no longer think it is drawing power from the ship. 
It&rsquo;s getting pure energy from that sphere above it, which presents a new 
worry. What&rsquo;s it doing with all of that power? Is it going to release it 
explosively? I have to keep Swann away from that sample; he will definitely 
shoot it out the airlock. With me strapped to it.<br>
 .<br>
 I tried scraping 
smaller samples, but all my tools broke. Luckily, I found some cast-off chips 
floating in the tank. Wonder how they came off? In any case, the chips revealed 
more of the matrix. It&rsquo;s keeping the energy in a vortex. How does it move 
energy so fast? It may be the fabled protoss warp technology. For all its 
complexity, the matrix is as solid as the strongest structure. Hm, I wonder if 
I could apply these dynamics to our own structures? Make a note.<br>
 I&rsquo;m 
learning so much from this crystal, but I can&rsquo;t help feeling as if 
it&rsquo;s learning from me, if that makes sense. Late. Tired. Sleep now.&rdquo;
</i><br>
 -3rd Research note<br>
 .<br>
<i>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been staring at 
that anomalous sphere above the crystal. It&rsquo;s obviously an energy 
emitter, but it has such strong containment that the crystal can slowly draw 
power from it via some method I don&rsquo;t understand. That gives me an idea: 
using our own containment technology, I could modify our SCV manufacturing 
process to double capacity with no increased risk. I think.<br>
 .<br>
 
Breakthrough! The energy in this crystal is not kept in a vortex pattern. It 
was warping the energy around so fast that I couldn&rsquo;t detect it. In an 
odd coincidence, the warping slowed just enough for my sensors to pick it up. 
Not sure how or why. Everytime I reach my wits&rsquo; end with this sample, 
something happens by&hellip; chance&hellip; and I get a breakthrough.<br>
 Is 
it helping me? Clearly I&rsquo;ve been working too many hours. I&rsquo;m going 
to go lose some more credits on Lost Viking.&rdquo;</i><br>
 -4th Research note
<br> .<br>
<i>&ldquo;Okay, I may be exceeding the boundaries of good science, 
but I am now sure this crystal has some sort of&hellip; if not sentience, at 
least&hellip; direction. I put a broken nano-fabricator in the tank last night, 
and today it&rsquo;s fixed. And it can accomplish things it shouldn&rsquo;t. If 
I can reverse engineer this fabricator, I could do amazing things with 
automated repair, or even near-instant manufacturing of advanced AI weaponry. 
Possibilities are limitless. On the less upbeat end of things, the level of 
energy stored in the crystal&rsquo;s matrix has not increased at all, despite 
the fact that the crystal continues to grow. So it must be emitting that energy 
somehow, some&hellip; where.&rdquo;</i><br>
 -5th Research note<br>
 .<br>
<i>
&ldquo;All of the containment and reinforced structural integrity theorems 
I&rsquo;ve developed from studying this crystal are starting to&hellip; 
well&hellip; crystallize. I think we might be able to contain energies that 
once required huge machines. Or even manufacture structures capable of hot 
landings from orbital origins with acceptable stresses.<br>
 .<br>
 I&rsquo;m a 
sham. I haven&rsquo;t truly learned anything from this crystal. I&rsquo;ve just 
observed the smallest details from it and somehow wrangled a few tidbits when 
the crystal&hellip; helped me. I don&rsquo;t understand how the protoss can 
possess technology of this magnitude and not rule the known universe. Perhaps 
they simply don&rsquo;t want to?<br>
 Last entry on this sample. I figured out 
where it is putting all that excess energy. It&rsquo;s feeding the Hyperion. 
Subtly helping to power the ship, balancing out some of the more ragged 
systems. It&rsquo;s giving of itself, and has been since it got here. Swann is 
excited that the ship is running so well, but he has no idea why. And I&rsquo;m 
not going to tell him.</i><br>

Webway teleport in behind a Protoss ship, empty a broadside and be gone when 
the ship turns comes around to fire back, then reteleport in behind the ship

 &lsquo;Can you show some examples of them 
using it?&rsquo;<br>

<br> But here&rsquo;s and example from Fulgrim.<br>
 -<br>
 
&ldquo;&lsquo;Something&rsquo;s happening below!&rsquo; shouted Saul Tarvitz. 
Marius scrambled to the edge of the ruins with Julius beside him and looked 
down at the strange alien gateway. Marius supposed it must lead to the 
craftworld above,which explained why they had not detected any ships leaving 
the craftworld, and how the Eldar reached the surface of Tarsis first.<br>
 A 
gathering of warriors surrounded the light, which flickered and danced like a 
candle flame. Their weapons were upraised, and they were chantingin a language 
that sounded more like song than communication.<br>
 &lsquo;What do you suppose 
they&rsquo;re doing?&rsquo; asked Tarvitz.<br>
 Julius shook his head. &lsquo;I 
don&rsquo;t know, but it can&rsquo;t be good for us.&rsquo;<br>
 Suddenly the 
light flared and its edges erupted in flames, as though a mighty fire forced 
its way through it. A shape began to form in the light, massive and dark, its 
outline humanoid, but surely too large for an Eldar warrior. Marius wondered if 
they would have to face another of the wraithlords.<br>
 A mighty spear tip 
emerged first, blazing runic symbols writhing on its wide blade, followed by a 
brazen arm that bled molten light into the air. The limb groaned like hot iron 
as it flexed and the body it belonged to emerged from the gateway.&rdquo;<br>

be heard over the shriek of the gun is the mocking laughter of the Death Jester 
as he eviscerates his foe&rdquo;.-GW<br>
 -<br>
 Then normal Harlequins-For the 
warrior dancers of the Harlequins, there is no distinction between art and war. 
Followers of the cunning deity known as the Laughing God, they are the 
strangest and most inscrutable of all the Eldar. Armed with a variety of 
weapons including the devastating fusion pistol and the vicious Harlequins 
Kiss. Sometimes accompanied by a Troupe Master, Shadowseer and a Death Jester, 
the Harlequins are a force to be reckoned with on the battlefield.-GW<br>
 -<br>
 Then Phoenix Lords who are the best at whatever their aspect is. 
Example-http://www.games-workshop.com/MEDIA_CustomProductCatalog/m1241344_99060104005_Maughanramain_445x319.jpg
<br> -Eldar Phoenix Lord Maugan Ra, The Harvester of Souls<br>
 Phoenix Lord 
Maugan-Ra, first of the Dark Reapers and Harvester of Souls. Maugan-Ra reaps a 
high toll of blood from those who oppose the Eldar.-GW<br>
 -<br>
 Then their 
Armor:<br>
 -Storm Serpent-The Storm Serpent carries a Wraithgate Webway 
portal, making it a heavily armoured and mobile Wraithgate; no one expects 
troops to spew forth from the belly of a Super Heavy Tank, let alone whole 
Warhosts!-GW<br>
 -<br>
 -Warlock Titan-A Warlock Titan contains within 
it&rsquo;s wraithbone core. the spirits of mighty Eldar Seers and Warlocks. As 
they were powerful psykers in life, so too are they in death. The psychic 
strength of these dead spirits, focused and amplified by the titan&rsquo;s 
wraithbone structure is phenomenal, far outstripping the powers of the 
living.-GW<br>
 -<br>
 -Phantom Titans-Built around a wraithbone core, Phantom 
titans are very different from other races titan&rsquo;s, because not only do 
they benefit from the experience of their crew who are raised with the Titan 
from birth, but also from the collective consciousness of spirit stones 
contained within the titan.-GW<br>
 -<br>
 Revenant Titans-The smallest of the 
Eldar Titans, the Revenant&rsquo;s compact size allows it to move with a 
swiftness and smoothness quite simply impossible for the war machines of other 
races. Equipped with Jump Jets, Pulse Lasers and Missile Launchers, the 
Revenant Titans&rsquo;s hunt in packs making lightning quick raids before 
dissapearing with the same terrifying speed.-GW<br>
 -<br>
 
Wraithlords-Towering over its foes, the Wraith lord is controlled by the 
essence of one of the craftworld&rsquo;s mightiest warriors. Able to be 
equipped with a wide variety of Heavy Weapons, Assault Weapons and even a close 
combat weapon the Wraithlord is an extremely versatile component in the Eldar 
battleplan.-GW<br>
 -<br>
 And Wraithguard- Constructed from wraithbone, 
Wraithguard are not living warriors, they are constructs which house a spirit 
stone containing the soul of an Eldar warrior. Armed with Wraithcannons these 
giants are fearsome opponents.-GW</p> </li>

<p>List of the Phoenix Kings, and correcting myself they are the first of 
their aspects and generally the best. All from GW<br>
 -<br>
 -Eldar Phoenix 
Lord Asurmen The Hand of Asur-<br>
 The Eldar Believe that Asurmen was the 
first of the Phoenix Lords. He was the founder of the Shrine of Asur, which has 
grown into the most widespread of all Aspects &ndash; The Dire Avengers.<br>
 -
<br> -Eldar Phoenix Lord Baharroth- The Cry of the Wind<br>
 Baharroth is 
believed to be the finest pupil of Asurmen. He was the winged Phoenix and 
founder of the Swooping Hawk Aspect.<br>
 -<br>
 -Eldar Phoenix Lord Fuegan The 
Burning Lance-<br>
 Fuegan is the founder of the Fire Dragon Shrine, teaching 
the art of death trough flame and fire. Like all Phoenix Lords Fuegan has been 
re-born many times giving him thousands of years of experience.<br>
 -<br>
 
-Eldar Phoenix Lord Jain Zar The Storm of Silence<br>
 Jain Zar is the Phoenix 
Lord of the Howling Banshee Aspect warriors. She is the most swift and 
ferocious of the Phoenix Lords. Jain Zar has travelled widely across the 
webway, and so it is that the Howling Banshees can be found on all but the 
remotest craftworld.<br>
 -<br>
 -Eldar Phoenix Lord Karandras, The Shadow 
Hunter<br>
 Karandras is one of the Eldar Phoenix Lords. Each Phoenix Lord is 
the master of one of the Aspect Temples. No one knows where Karandras 
originally came from, but it is known that he was not the first Exarch of the 
Striking Scorpions.<br>
 -<br>
 -Eldar Phoenix Lord Maugan Ra, The Harvester of 
Souls<br>
 Phoenix Lord Maugan-Ra, first of the Dark Reapers and Harvester of 
Souls. Maugan-Ra reaps a high toll of blood from those who oppose the Eldar.</p>

<p>The Eldar are not as outnumbered as most would think. It&rsquo;s true that 
their numbers are small, but that&rsquo;s in comparison to the Orks and 
Imperium whos numbers are in the trillions. The Eldar mostly live on 
Craftworlds and there could be hundreds of those.The Eldar would be in this 
battle with 9-10 Craftworlds. Craftworlds are between 10-100 km depending on 
their population (They grow and shrink based on the eb of psychic energy/souls).
</p> 
<p>Except from &lsquo;Doom of the Eldar&rsquo; BFG supplement pdf:</p> 
<p>&ldquo;Craftworlds, though spacecraft, are vast beyond comprehension. They 
are not merely huge capital ships ploughing through space with a surrounding 
escort of smaller vessels. they are not even akin to vast cities, as some of 
the largest star forts of the Imperium might be considered, but rather are 
immense spacefaring worlds accompanied by vast armadas, the likes of which 
might otherwise be set aside to defend an entire system or even sub-sector. 
Whole battlefleets cluster around key points and stations all across the 
thousands of miles of the craftworld&rsquo;s exterior as smaller, nimbler craft 
rush and surge across its surface in a constant shimmering patrol. &rdquo;</p> 
<p>Most powerful Craftworlds:<br>
 Ulthwe<br>
 Iyanden<br>
 Alaitoc<br>
 
Saim-hann<br>
 Biel-tan</p> 
<p>Lesser Craftworlds:<br>
 Lugganath<br>
 Iybraesil<br>
 Yme-loc<br>
 Altansar
<br> Il-Kaithe<br>
 Kaelor</p> 
<p>Obscure Craftworlds:<br>
 Dorhai (they think all other Eldar are corrupted 
by Slaanesh, Codex Imperialis)<br>
 Dolthe (Gaunt&rsquo;s Ghosts)<br>
 Ctho 
(&ldquo;Lost World&rdquo;, Codex Imperialis)<br>
 Meros (&ldquo;Doomed 
World&rdquo;, ibidem)<br>
 Bel-Shammon (destroyed by the Imperium, Shadow Point
<br> Kher-Ys (destroyed by a Keeper of Secrets, Codex: Daemons)<br>
 Telennar 
(has many Rangers, allied to Alaitoc, Index Xenos: Rangers)<br>
 Idharae 
(destroyed by Invaders Space Marines, Codex: Space Marines)<br>
 Zandros (site 
of Karandras vs Ahra duel, Rulebook 5e<br>
 Vassiera (mentioned in a Medusa V 
report, &ldquo;canonized&rdquo; army of some fan)<br>
 Ava-nile (Dawn of War)
<br> Menaan (DoW:SS)<br>
 Reia-Hal-<br>
 Tyriande-</p> 
<p>The largest Craftworld had mountain ranges and oceans within it. The 
Imperial Navy attacked a Craftworld and lost their entire sector fleet.</p> 
<p>And there ground forces are no joke either:</p> 
<p>&ldquo;There is a story of a mere handful of Eldar warriors so inspiring 
and poignant that it has already entered the realm of legend. On the ice-fields 
of Articus a million-strong swarm of Tyranids poured down the ice-plains 
towards the chasms that held the last of the open webway portals. The rangers 
of Alaitoc alerted the forces stationed below of there approach, but the 
perimiter forces left to protect the Farseers had become so thin that there was 
no real hope. A few score Dire Avenger Aspect Warriors took up position in the 
narrowest part of the chasm leading towards the webway gate. As the ice turned 
dark with the sheer number of vile, scuttling beasts coming for them, the Dire 
Avengers began to kill. They unleashed storm after storm of sliver-thin blades, 
and the bodies of the alien killer-beasts piled high. Though they fell, 
one-by-one, the Dire Avengers slaughtered thousands of the beasts in the space 
of an hour. The chitinous bodies of alien organisms became a mountain that the 
Dire Avengers scaled step-by-step, raining down a curtain of fire upon those 
that tried to clamber up the bodies of their kin. The foe was still without 
number, and here an there an alien talon would bypass the defences of the 
Exarch and take another Eldar life. But, as the final Dire Avenger bled their 
last, the Tyranids broke into dissaray, scattering to the four winds. The only 
alien taint to reach the Farseers was the river of stinking, black blood that 
flowed down into the chasm.&rdquo; -Medusa V report</p> 
<p>As we all know, Dire Avengers, Rangers and Guardians are the 
&lsquo;regular&rsquo; infantry units. Their elite units, Striking Scorpions, 
Dark Reapers, Warp Spiders, Howling Banshees, Swooping Hawks, etc, would be 
able to counter just about anything the Protos can through at them. I dont know 
how fast the Protoss are, but in &lsquo;Path of the Warrior&rdquo; a Striking 
Scorpion watches a SM bolter round moving like it&rsquo;s in slow motion.</p> 
<p>And they have a weapon for every threat: 
[url]http://i6.photobucket.com/albums/y246/BranDoom21/721px-Eldar_Weapons.jpg[/url]
</p> 
<p>As far as the Eldar Heavy weapons, the Eldar Cobra uses distortion cannon 
which tears reality apart and sucks everything around it into the warp. So even 
if a target was invincible, the Eldar do not need to destroy it they can just 
make it go away.</p> 
<p>Also don&rsquo;t forget about Titans.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>#67</strong> <br>

<p>@Galorian, thank you very much for the quotes, everyone else too.<br>
 .<br>
 Anyway, by the Eldar (battle scenario fails, calling them Eldars and Elders) 
does that include Dark Eldar, Harlequins, Exodites, etc? Or just Craftworld 
Eldar? Makes a big difference.<br>
 .<br>
 Anyway, I will start assuming that 
we are talking about just the Craftworld Eldar.<br>
 .<br>
 Their firepower is 
in fact higher than the Imperium&rsquo;s firepower, but their ships are much 
more fragile, but still able to tank the petaton blasts from the Imperium.<br>
 
.<br>
 They are much faster than Imperial ships, usually flying literal circles 
around them, and the Imperial ships fly around .75c at combat speed.<br>
 .<br>

 They also use holofields, which makes it nigh impossible to hit them unless 
you put out enough firepower to blanket the entire area of space they might 
occupy.<br>
 .<br>
 However, their strongest assets are the Craftworlds 
(assuming just Craftworld Eldar). They are nigh unassailable, even Imperial 
fleets are crushed against them, they are planet or even star sized in certain 
cases, and can easily drive by and bombard a planet to cinders with exotic 
weapons, including dark matter guns.<br>
 .<br>
 I would include ground 
battles, but they will be almost irrelevant, however, Exarchs are not to be 
trifled with.</p> </li>

 Also you don&rsquo;t necessarily have to

shown to be able to banish Ghosts(since Phantoon&rsquo;s a Ghost, then 
regardless of whether or not the thing&rsquo;s even alive, elemental 
compatibility rules will affect that thing!) from the Battle of the Labyrinth, 
because if they don&rsquo;t work, i&rsquo;m gunna have to go for broke and get

<p>@Tau</p> 
<p>Haven&rsquo;t gotten around to mentioning that fact, either.<br>
 Methinks 
gut hunch says you have a bold plan or two in store, if/when the facts are 
mentioned, right?<br>
 If so, get there, see if you can help with the quotes 
for the earlier novels, list out the feats from T.L.O and i&rsquo;ll see if i 
can do the rest, alright?</p> </li>

<p>&ldquo;You still got the other C.H.B novels from 1st series, though?&rdquo;
<br> -I don&rsquo;t have &ldquo;Titan&rsquo;s Curse&rdquo; at the moment sadly. 
But I do have Labyrinth, Thief, and Sea of Monsters.</p> </li>

<p>I have the Titan&rsquo;s Curse and T.L.O&rsquo;s at where i live, now are 
we ready to assemble the other unlisted quotes worth of feats to note, back at 
the group fight thread i mentioned?</p> 
<p>Also are we ready to address the Protoss to see whether or not they can 
hold their own against the Eldar, in the meantime?</p> </li>

<p>Well for some reason he was saying &ldquo;-If they are still Eldar and not 
Dark I&rsquo;m counting them.&rdquo; So I thought that he was deciding or 
another name for SgCombine.<br>
 .<br>
 Apologies, so SgCombine, what Eldar are 
included?</p> </li>

<p>Hmmm, I stated current incarnation, which is just the Craftworld Eldar 
right, since the Dark Eldar are with Chaos if I&rsquo;m not mistaken. So 
we&rsquo;ll go with that.</p> </li>

<p>Ok &hellip; what about the Warp Spiders &hellip; with their warp gen jump 
packs &hellip; whats stopping them from warping into the ships placing charges 
and warping out &hellip; Not to mention their use in ground fighting to do 
similar guerilla warfare tactics</p> </li>

<p>@SgCombine the Dark Eldar aren&rsquo;t with Chaos, they are separate, but 
do have occasional demonic things happen, but alright, assuming they are out it 
is Craftworld Eldar, Exodites, Harlequins. Which will be plenty for taking out 
the Protoss.</p> </li>

<p>@Skalkorik, Warp Spiders make small jumps, maybe a few killometers or 
shorter at a time. I&rsquo;ve never read about them jumping hundred of 
killometers.</p> 
<p>Also, to clear up some things:</p> 
<p>Warp gates- WGs are more like relay beacons than gates. As long as a WG is 
near by the Eldar can transport themselves and ships to that area. For 
instance, if there is a WG on a moon, the Eldar can warp onto the planet or if 
the WG is in good condition and strong enough (Many of the gates have become 
weak over the eons) then they can transport their fleets around the moon.</p> 
<p>FTL- The Eldar cannot use the warp for more than a few small puddle jumps 
since they do not have the equivalent of an Astropath like the Imperium. 
Craftworlds cannot use the warp at all, but they can use the WG.</p> 
<p>The Avatar of Khaine- You cant just mass produce these guys. It requires 
days of prayer and the sacrifice of a great warrior. But Khaine&rsquo;s real 
benefit to the Eldar is the psychic effect. When the Eldar fight with the 
Avatar their can shrug off damage they normally wouldn&rsquo;t, they are much 
faster, stronger and are almost as blood seeking as a Berserker. They become 
pretty viscous.</p> </li> </ol> 1 2 3 &hellip; 6 Next &raquo; <br>
