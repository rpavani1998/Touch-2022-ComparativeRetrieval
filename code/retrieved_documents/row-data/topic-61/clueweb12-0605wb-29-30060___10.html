<h1>Superman vs. Hulk: Who Would Win in a Fight</h1> <em>Hulk Smash Krypton

 Superman vs. Hulk: Who Would Win in a Fight<br>
&copy; 
Bob Trate <br>

<p>&nbsp;</p> Bruce Banner, on the run from the law and undercover, eventually 
makes his way to Metropolis.&nbsp;Working as a medic at a homeless shelter, he 
runs into trouble when Lex Luthor decides to demolish the shelter to make way 
for a LexCorp subsidiary or secret laboratory of some sort.&nbsp;It 
doesn&rsquo;t really matter; the bottom line is that Luthor won&rsquo;t like 
Dr. Banner when he&rsquo;s angry.&nbsp;Gamma-powered blood begins to flow, 
pulse pounds and heart rate increases&hellip; next thing you know, we&rsquo;ve 
got an eight-foot, 1,400 lb rampaging behemoth tearing up 
Metropolis.&nbsp;Looks like a job for Superman! <br>
<b>The Tale of the Tape</b>
<p></p> <b>Superman&rsquo;s Strengths (or Why Kal-El could KO Hulk)</b> <br>

Well, Superman sort of has a reputation for being the most powerful being on 
the planet earth.&nbsp;Not only that, he&rsquo;s smart&ndash;not smarter than 
Dr. Bruce Banner, but definitely smarter than the Hulk.&nbsp;If Superman is 
going to win this battle, he&rsquo;s going to have to rely on brains over 
brawn, which shouldn&rsquo;t be too hard, considering the Hulk&rsquo;s 
intelligence level is on par with the average 5-year old. <br>
While the Hulk 
is just a big, strong monster, Superman is faster than a speeding bullet and 
more powerful than a locomotive.&nbsp;Even a nuclear explosion can&rsquo;t put 
him down for the count, so he could definitely go toe-to-toe with the Hulk and 
give ol&rsquo; jade jaws a run for his money.&nbsp;But wait, there&rsquo;s 
more!&nbsp;Superman possesses a smorgasbord of abilities far beyond those of 
mortal men.&nbsp;He could use his super breath to freeze the Hulk.&nbsp;He 
could bore a hole into the earth at super speed and bury the Hulk in 
it.&nbsp;He could use his microscopic vision to&hellip; OK; maybe that one 
wouldn&rsquo;t be of much use. <br>

<p></p> <b>Hulk&rsquo;s Strengths (or Why Hulk Could Knock Supes for a Loop)
</b> <br>
The Incredible Hulk definitely lives up to his name.&nbsp;His level 
of strength, endurance and healing ability is determined by his emotional 
state.&nbsp;Or to put it more simply, the madder Hulk gets, the stronger Hulk 
gets.&nbsp;When the Hulk goes on a rampage, the best we can hope for is that he 
eventually gets bored and leaves.&nbsp;He has withstood temperatures equivalent 
of those found in the sun&rsquo;s core, been hit with a nuclear bomb and 
survived planet-splitting impacts.&nbsp;Heck, he&rsquo;s gone 12 rounds with 
the God of Thunder and was barely breathing heavy.&nbsp;He took on the entire 
Marvel Universe a couple of years ago in a story entitled &ldquo;World War 
Hulk.&rdquo; <br>
And you think a little solar-powered Kryptonian is gonna be 
able to beat him? <br>

<p></p> <b>The Weaknesses</b> <br>
As far as weaknesses go, the Hulk has 
really only got one, but it&rsquo;s a doozy: He&rsquo;s as dumb as a box of 
rocks.&nbsp;If you can figure out a way to outthink the Hulk, you might be able 
to beat him. <br>
Superman&rsquo;s got a few weaknesses, but since the Hulk 
isn&rsquo;t magical and he&rsquo;s not likely carrying a chunk of Kryptonite in 
those ripped-up purple pants, there&rsquo;s really only one flaw left for him 
to exploit: Superman&rsquo;s heart.&nbsp;Superman might possess enough power to 
actually kill the Hulk, but would he do it?&nbsp;Unlikely.&nbsp;Add to that the 
distraction of saving the lives of innocents caught in the midst of the battle 
and Superman is gonna have his hands full.&nbsp;It might be just enough to give 
the Hulk the upper hand. <br>

<p></p> <b>Historical Matchups</b> <br>
Perhaps the best way to compare these 
two combatants is to take a look at some of the more notable bouts 
they&rsquo;ve had in the past.&nbsp;By taking a look at the caliber of their 
old rivals and their win/loss records, we can better determine who will come 
out on top. <br>
<b>The Last Son of Krypton has had his share of notable 
enemies, among them:</b> Bizarro&ndash;an imperfect clone of the Man of 
Steel.&nbsp;He&rsquo;s all the brawn with half the brains.&nbsp;Superman has 
handed Bizarro his ass on many occasions. <br>
General Zoda Kryptonian villain 
who possesses all of Superman&rsquo;s powers but none of his morals.&nbsp;The 
Son of Jor-El has narrowly defeated this villain by trapping him in the Phantom 
Zone.&nbsp;It&rsquo;s sort of like the superhero equivalent of hitting a guy 
with a loaded glove. <br>
Doomsday&ndash;a genetically modified Kryptonian 
engine of destruction, Doomday is a lot like Clubber Lang in<i>Rocky III</i>, 
or more appropriately, Ivan Drago in<i>Rocky IV</i>.&nbsp;He&rsquo;s not only 
defeated Superman, he killed him! <br>
<b>The Incredible Hulk has fought a 
number of heavy-hitting bruisers as well&hellip;</b> Abomination&ndash;sort of 
the Bizarro-Hulk, Abomination has gamma-powered muscles and a scientists&rsquo; 
brain.&nbsp;He&rsquo;s one of the few folks who has actually managed to KO the 
Hulk! <br>
Absorbing Man&ndash;Crusher Creel possesses the ability to take on 
the characteristics of whatever he touches: steel, rock, etc.&nbsp;He&rsquo;s 
turned into stone and been smashed to pieces by the Hulk more times than we can 
count. <br>
The Leader&ndash;gamma radiation gave this guy a big ol&rsquo; 
brain instead of muscles.&nbsp;Despite his impressive intellect, he&rsquo;s 
never been able to get the Hulk down for the count, proving that sometimes might
<i>does</i> make right! <br>

<p></p> <b>The Outcome</b> <br>
So who wins?&nbsp;The way we see it, it goes 
down like this&hellip; <br>
After doing a number on Metropolis and laying waste 
to the Science Police and a few minor heroes, the Hulk finally comes 
face-to-face with the toughest battle of his life: Superman.&nbsp;The two lock 
horns and create massive amounts of property damage.&nbsp;No matter how hard 
Hulk hits Supes, the Big Blue Boy Scout just won&rsquo;t stay down, a fact that 
only serves to further enrage the Hulk.&nbsp;The adrenaline starts flowing and 
the Hulk &ldquo;Hulks out,&rdquo; to use a popular phrase.&nbsp; <br>
Hulk 
could care less about the puny humans who get in his way but Superman is 
determined to make sure there will be no collateral damage in this 
fight.&nbsp;This distraction allows the Hulk to get in a few cheap shots, 
weakening the Man of Steel.&nbsp;Just as it&rsquo;s looking like we&rsquo;re 
going to see another Doomsday scenario, Kal-El whisks the Hulk off to the 
Arctic Circle where the only ones in danger are a few penguins and a polar bear.
<br> The battle rages on but before it&rsquo;s too late, Superman manages to 
get inside the Fortress of Solitude and nail the Hulk with the Phantom Zone 
projector, sending the gamma-spawned behemoth to that netherworld between 
worlds.&nbsp;It&rsquo;s a victory for the Man of Steel, but in the process, 
Hulk laid waste to Metropolis and trashed the Fortress of Solitude, destroying 
many of Superman&rsquo;s personal items, historical Kryptonian artifacts and 
his prized stamp collection. <br>

<p>I&nbsp;hate Superman but admit, he'd win because he's neigh invunerable, 
which is one reason that I hate him and the movies he's been in. &nbsp;As a kid 
I didn't but now that&nbsp;I'm all grown-up I can't stand them.&nbsp; All he 
would have to do - though - like you said - is throw him into the sun or 
something.&nbsp; Your idead about the Negative Zone is a good one.&nbsp; 
Probably the only one that - in relation to the Superman's ethics - could 
possibly come out.&nbsp; Though didn't Doomsday kill Superman and he wasn't 
magic or made of Kryptonite either.&nbsp; I dunno.</p> <br>

<p>Superman would use his heat vision at a long range attack luring the Hulk 
away from Metropolis. Once clear of the city Supes would use his super breath 
to freeze the Hulk. While only a temporary solution it's just long enough for 
Supes to toss the Hulk like a salad into outter space. The Hulk while in orbit 
explodes from his icey prison only to float helplessly in zero gravity. 
Superman then proceeds to give the Hulk a stern lecture about anger managment. 
After several minutes of Superman's corny speech the Hulk becomes bored and his 
anger disapates. He reverts back to Dr. Bruce Banner and before Supes can react 
he suffocates in the cold vacume of space.<em><strong>SUPERMAN B-I-T-C-H-E-S!!!

<p><em>Scenario #2</em></p> 
<p>Superman wants to use his heat vision to lure the Hulk away from Metropolis 
but can't due to the amount of civilians caught in the cross fire.&nbsp; Forced 
to close the distance Supes flys too close. The Hulk who screams &quot;Bad Blue 
Boy&quot; does a super jump snatching Supes in mid air sticking him in a rear 
naked choke MMA style. Hulk then jumps to about 30,000 feet holding Supes like 
a rag doll and colides with Oceanic flight 815. Supes cape gets caught in the 
turbine ripping off as a stunned Hurley remarks, &quot;Dude&quot;. Free falling 
back to earth the Hulk atomic pile drives Superman's head straight into the 
roof of Lexcorp. Crashing through 100 floors before landing in a seceret 
labratory at the basement level. A stunned Lex Luthor looks up from his work 
bench tinkering with a bomb that apears to be laced with kryptonite. Hulk 
punches Superman's face into a bloody pulp infront of a giddy Lex.<strong><em>

<p>HULK WINS!&nbsp; He gets stronger the madder he gets.&nbsp; If Doomsday can 
do in Superman then surely Hulk would have no problem.&nbsp; Come to think of 
it let Hulk take on Doomsday and Superman at the same time.....he he</p> <br>

KillerTomato 9/17/2009 5:23:36 AM <br>

<p>This fight has bothered me since Marvel vs DC back in the day.&nbsp; First 
off I've always disliked Superman...but I really try not be bias in my 
opinion.&nbsp; Okay, so Superman has like every major power known to man and 
&quot;super&quot;man alike, and the Incredible Hulk...well he's big, green, 
dumb, and persistent.&nbsp; The thing is Superman definitely has the advantage 
because of all his powers, so as long as Hulk never actually got his hands on 
Supes, Superman could win.&nbsp; Though the minute Hulk got in a good hit, well 
that's when things change.&nbsp; Superman has a peak strength, the Hulk 
doesn't...the madder Hulk gets, the stronger he gets...so every time Superman 
scored some pavement busting punches Hulk would slowly be getting 
stronger...eventually he'd be a raging green behemoth...and as long as Superman 
doesn't get to use his vast plethora of powers...in a knock-down, drag-out 
fight...Hulk beats Superman to a red-blue blur.</p> <br>

<p>MRJAW..superman died when he was fighting doomsday becasue he allowed 
himself to die..he gave up because he knew if they kept fighting more and more 
innocent people would die. But im with you on SUPERMAN, although i like the 
movies. I dont like the fact that he is all powerfull and pretty much 
invulnerable. The Hulk is bad ass just because his powers are dictated by his 
state of mind. Well the level of his power that is.</p> 
<p>I really need to get the trade paperback of world war hulk..will look for 
it at comic con in town this weekend :)</p> <br>
Matador 9/17/2009 5:41:44 AM

<p>Agree with Killer Tomato.&nbsp; Supes is at his highest peak from the 
begining since he does need recharge from the sun. A long drag out battle will 
eventually weaken supes of his energy but at that time while Supes is wiping 
Hulk around he is&nbsp;only getting madder &amp; stonger. As we all know Hulk 
can and will adabt to his foes and evironment so he may act like he got rocks 
up in&nbsp;his head&nbsp;but its a matter of time before he polishes'em.</p> 
<p>Hulk could pull it off; his had allot more training fighting brusiers than 
Supes.</p> <br>
Cabal 9/17/2009 5:56:38 AM <br>

<p>I'm going to ignore the whole business of Superman vs. the Hulk, and 
confine myself to saying, penguins in the<em>Arctic</em>? I'm sorry -- my 
suspension of disbelief can easily handle a solar-powered alien and a 
gamma-irradiated human having an enormous battle, but penguins in the Arctic is 
simply too much.</p> <br>
goldeneyez 9/17/2009 6:04:46 AM <br>

<p>Superman wins.&nbsp; This really isn't a fair fight, Superman is too 
powerful.&nbsp; Superspeed at times rivaling the Flash, Superstregnth on par 
with the Hulk, Heat vision, Cold Breath, Flight, Invulnerability... Plus, he is 
smart, has access to Kryptonian technology.</p> 
<p>People keep talking about Superman is at his peak power... so.&nbsp; Piss 
Superman off &amp; see if he doesn't unleash.&nbsp; On top of that how long 
would it take to get mad enough to be at Superman's strenght level? The way I 
look at it, Sups probably holds back most of the time he fights because he 
could pinky kill most folks.&nbsp; If he were to unleash wel...</p> 
<p>Ultimately, all&nbsp;Superman&nbsp;has to do is throw him into orbit wait 
for him to black out from lack of oxygen, &amp; go up and save him at 
superspeed... Spiderman actually did this back in the Super-Spiderman days of 
the 90s.</p> 
<p>I love both characters, but about the only way Hulk could win is with 
outside help (Luthor exposes the Hulk to&nbsp;green Kryptonite 
radiation)&nbsp;or Superman not being on his A game.</p> <br>

<p>this article goes under the assumption that supes has already fought dooms 
and learned from it each time. also, there's many different hulks. so let's say 
this was supes, no doomsday fight. and this was rampaging hulk, no world war, 
no banner. supes would stand no chance if it was a straight up one-on-one.</p>
