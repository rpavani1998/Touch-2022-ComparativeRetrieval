<h2>Top 10 Must Read Comic Stories of All Time</h2> 
<p> Posted 2:10 PM Aug 5, 2011 by Odinson &middot; No Comments <br>

Comics </p> 
<p>Greetings from the Odinson,<br>
<br>
I love super heroes.&nbsp; Many have 
said they are the mythology of our time.&nbsp; Like mighty Hercules or noble 
King Arthur, the super heroes of the modern world inspire the readers to be 
better than they thought they could be and arouse their imaginations.&nbsp; I 
love reading about brave men and women who are faster than a speeding bullet 
and able to leap tall buildings in a single bound.&nbsp; I love to read about 
unparalleled detectives that can solve riddles that would turn an ordinary 
man&rsquo;s brain to cream cheese.&nbsp; I love to read about extraordinary 
people in extraordinary circumstances, good vs. evil in exotic locales and far 
off worlds that excite my imagination.&nbsp; I read comic books because of 
super heroes.&nbsp; The following list is comprised of the tales that I keep 
coming back to over and over again.&nbsp; These are the reasons why I love 
comics so much.&nbsp; These are&hellip;<br>
<br>
<strong>Top 10 Must Read Comic 
Stories of All Time</strong><br>
<br>
<strong>Watchmen</strong> &ndash; To say 
that Watchmen is a must read story is an enormous understatement.&nbsp; This is 
quite possibly the best executed visual storytelling ever put to paper.&nbsp; 
Artist Dave Gibbons is a master storyteller and Alan Moore&rsquo;s script is 
mesmerizing, haunting, and unforgettable.&nbsp; So influential is this tale 
that the industry, as a whole, has been trying to capture that same 
lightning-in-a-bottle for over twenty-five years since Watchmen came out.&nbsp; 
Set against the backdrop of a real world setting, Watchmen is a murder mystery 
where the last remaining masked crime-fighters assemble to save the world, and 
themselves.&nbsp; Moore and Gibbons use juxtaposition and symbolism to explore 
politics, morals, and the human condition.&nbsp; Watchmen is a cautionary tale, 
a beautiful piece of literature and art, and it stars super heroes.&nbsp; 
Unprecedented&hellip;unparalleled&hellip;often imitated, but never 
duplicated&hellip;Watchmen is a masterpiece of modern literature and is one of 
the must read comic book stories of all time.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<strong>Wolverine: 
The Japan Adventure</strong> &ndash; In Hollywood the phrase 
&ldquo;star-making-role&rdquo; is used a lot.&nbsp; Well, this was a 
star-making story of the feral X-Man known as Wolverine.&nbsp; For years he was 
the stand-out character in the All-New, All-Different X-Men, which debuted in
Giant-Size X-Men #1.&nbsp; He was the surly little tough guy that questioned 
authority, but always seemed to come through for his teammates in the 
end.&nbsp; Wolverine was popular, but The Japan Adventure made him a star, an 
A-Lister.&nbsp; Before this story, Wolverine was walking a thin line with a 
personality bordering on unlikable.&nbsp; This tale, however, pulls the veil 
back a bit and allows the reader to see Logan in a different light, a 
vulnerable one.&nbsp; Longtime X-Men scribe Chris Claremont explores 
Logan&rsquo;s complex personality from all angles &ndash; feral berserker, 
noble samurai, and mutant hero.&nbsp; And artist Frank Miller creates a 
definitive look for Wolverine and a style that is still being emulated to this 
day.&nbsp; If they ever do another Wolverine movie (a good one anyway), this 
comic book tale should be used for the 
storyboards.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<strong>Thor: Alone 
against the Celestials</strong> &ndash; This three-issue arc from Thor 
(1962-1996 1st Series) #387-389 beautifully shows why we love super 
heroes.&nbsp; How does a writer challenge a hero as powerful as the mighty 
Thor?&nbsp; He is the god of thunder, wielder of invincible Mjolnir and the 
Prince of fabled Asgard for crying out loud.&nbsp; Easy, put him up against the 
Celestials.&nbsp; If you are unfamiliar or need to be reminded of just how 
immeasurably powerful these space-gods are, check outThe Eternals Saga.&nbsp; 
Thor arrives on a far off world ruled by pirates.&nbsp; This is a vile planet 
where thieves, cutthroats and evil men reign supreme.&nbsp; Their planet will 
now be judged by the Celestials.&nbsp; Even though this is a world of evil, 
there are lives at stake and Thor will do everything in his power to save 
it.&nbsp; That is what a hero does, no matter what the odds.&nbsp; This tale 
allows the reader to see Thor&rsquo;s incredible power unleashed like very few 
times in the history of comics and witness one of the greatest displays of 
courage ever.&nbsp; As the reader turns each page he is treated to a spectacle 
of wonderment rarely captured on the four color page.&nbsp; This tale 
unquestionably and firmly establishes the hierarchy of power in the Marvel 
Universe and, without a doubt, shows the mighty Odinson at his 
finest.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<strong>New Teen Titans: The 
Judas Contract</strong> &ndash; A super villain knowing a super hero&rsquo;s 
secret identity is one of the worst possible things that can happen, and that 
is exactly what happens in this instant classic by the great Marv Wolfman and 
George Perez.&nbsp;Deathstroke the Terminator blames the Teen Titans for the 
death of his son,Ravager, and plots the teen heroes&rsquo; downfall.&nbsp; 
Betrayed by one of their own, the next generation of heroes is systematically 
and utterly defeated by one of the most dangerous men alive.&nbsp; In this tale 
the reader sees the death of a Titan, the debut of a new member, and watches as 
Dick Grayson makes the transition fromBoy Wonder to the adult hero known as 
Nightwing.&nbsp; The Judas Contract is just super hero comics at their very 
best.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<strong>All-Star Superman</strong> 
&ndash; Grant Morrison and Frank Quitely unite to tell quite frankly the 
greatest Superman story of all time.&nbsp; This is an awe-inspiring, 
mind-blowing adventure that grabs hold of the reader&rsquo;s imagination and 
never lets go.&nbsp; All the elements are here &ndash;Lois Lane, Jimmy Olsen, 
Lex Luthor, Bizarro, the Daily Planet, the Fortress of Solitude, the Kent Farm, 
Kryptonite, Clark Kent ripping open his shirt to reveal the unmistakable S 
shield of Superman!&nbsp; This tale explores Superman&rsquo;s mythos in a way 
rarely seen in comics and beautifully illustrates why the Man of Steel is the 
greatest super hero of all time.&nbsp; One minute the reader is gasping, the 
next he is laughing out loud, and the next he is cheering.&nbsp; All-Star 
Superman is a perfect comic book and a definite must read.<br>
<br>
<strong>The 
Dark Knight Returns</strong> &ndash; This is the story that defined the Caped 
Crusader for a whole generation of comic readers.&nbsp; Set in the not too 
distant future, Dark Knight Returns shows a world without super heroes.&nbsp; 
Crime is at an all time high, the United States is on the brink of nuclear war 
with Russia, and there seems to be no hope in sight.&nbsp; Vicious gangs have 
taken over the streets of Gotham City and the police are powerless to stop 
them.&nbsp; It is at this moment that Bruce Wayne, now an old man, decides that 
he has had enough.&nbsp; Batman returns after a ten year hiatus, and he sets 
out to take back the night with a vengeance.&nbsp; As storyteller Frank Miller 
puts it &ldquo;&hellip;this is the story that gave Batman his [cojones] 
back.&rdquo;&nbsp; This is the story that inspired Tim Burton&rsquo;s take on
Batman and set the stage for the character-defining Batman: The Animated Series
.&nbsp; Featuring the ultimate Batman/Superman showdown, Dark Knight Returns 
also went a long way in establishing the relationship between these two icons 
for the next two decades.&nbsp; Before this story, Batman was already an A-List 
super hero, but this tale made Batman a legend.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<strong>Preacher
</strong> &ndash; Preacher is a bold, in-your-face, and unapologetic epic that 
resonates with the reader long after the final page is turned.&nbsp; It is the 
ultimate road trip story of one man&rsquo;s literal search for God.&nbsp; How 
can I possibly describe a tale with vampires, angels, demons, clandestine 
paramilitary secret empires, gun-toting girlfriends, two-fisted heroes, 
underground Goth societies, voodoo, evil racist business men, super cops, 
serial killers, religious zealots, Texas Rangers, a war in the sun, the Word of 
God and last stands at the Alamo and possibly do it justice.&nbsp; Writer Garth 
Ennis is at his wicked best and artist Steve Dillon visually delivers a story 
for the ages.&nbsp; Be warned, this is not for the kids or faint of 
heart.&nbsp; Preacher is an over-the-top action/adventure that makes a Quentin 
Tarantino movie seem tame by comparison.&nbsp; Why this guilty pleasure has not 
been turned into a movie trilogy or HBO TV series is beyond me.&nbsp;Preacher 
is a tale the Odinson revisits at least once a year and the best adult comic 
book story produced sinceWatchmen.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
<br>
<strong>X-Men: The 
Dark Phoenix Saga</strong> &ndash; The Dark Phoenix Saga is a great example of 
two creators at the height of their powers.&nbsp; Chris Claremont and John 
Byrne orchestrate the ultimate super hero story.&nbsp; The 
character-to-character interactions, the drama, the eye-popping action 
sequences, the mind-blowing displays of power and destruction make this tale 
unforgettable.&nbsp; They say that power corrupts and absolute power corrupts 
absolutely.&nbsp; This is the challenge the Children of the Atom must face when 
Jean Grey, due in no small part to the manipulations of the vileHellfire Club, 
loses control of her cosmic power known as thePhoenix.&nbsp; The heroes 
struggle with the dilemma of saving the universe at the cost of their beloved 
friend&rsquo;s life.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a tale of ultimate sacrifice that does 
not talk down to its readers but rather invites them to experience the drama 
along with the X-Men as this modern day tragedy unfolds.&nbsp; I am not a big 
X-Men fan but this is, without a doubt, one of the must read comic book stories 
of all time.&nbsp;<strong>NOTE</strong>: It also doesn&rsquo;t hurt that the 
wonderfulKitty Pryde makes her debut in this story as well.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>

<br><strong>Marvel Super-Heroes Secret Wars</strong> &ndash; Long before Fear 
Itself, Civil War, or House of M, long before big company crossovers and big 
event storylines became everyday humdrum in the comic industry, there wasMarvel 
Super Heroes Secret Wars.&nbsp; This twelve issue maxi-series featured the 
world&rsquo;s greatest heroes (theAvengers, Fantastic Four, X-Men, Spider-Man 
and theHulk) as they are kidnapped by a being of ultimate power and whisked to 
the far side of the cosmos to engage in mortal combat against a small army of 
the Marvel U&rsquo;s most dangerous super villains.&nbsp; Not only was Secret 
Wars one of the first Big Event stories but with its long lasting effects on 
the Marvel Universe, it encapsulated everything a Big Event should be.&nbsp; The
Thing quits the FF and the She-Hulk joins the team, the next year for the Hulk 
is set-up,Colossus ends his romantic relationship with Kitty Pryde, we are 
introduced to a new hero (Spider-Woman) and new villains (Volcana and Titania), 
theAbsorbing Man gets a girlfriend whom he is with to this very day, Magneto 
sides with the White Hats, andSpider-Man gets his black costume which later 
joins with Eddie Brock to becomeVenom.&nbsp; One of my favorite things about 
this story is the character-to-character interactions.&nbsp; This was at a time 
in Marvel&rsquo;s history when the Marvel Age was still young enough where all 
the heroes didn&rsquo;t know each other inside and out and quite frankly 
didn&rsquo;t necessarily get along.&nbsp; Friendships and bonds that exist 
today can be traced back to this original ultimate 
team-up.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<strong>Crisis on Infinite 
Earths</strong> &ndash; Crisis is the biggest, best, most influential Big Event 
to ever be produced.&nbsp; It literally changed the landscape of the DC 
Universe.&nbsp; Heroes died, whole galaxies crumbled, and the DCU has never 
been the same since.&nbsp; When an unstoppable force starts to rip through the 
multiverse and destroy everything in its path, every single hero and villain on 
every single remaining parallel Earth in every single time era, from the dawn 
of mankind to the far-flung future, must unite to save all reality.&nbsp; Marv 
Wolfman and George Perez deliver the most epic super hero story ever 
told.&nbsp; And by the end of it, the DCU re-launched stronger and better than 
ever.&nbsp; For the next twenty-five years this would be known as the 
Post-Crisis DCU.&nbsp; Much like DC Comics is doing now with the New 52,Superman
,Wonder Woman, SHAZAM, Aquaman, Flash and the Justice League all restarted from 
number one and reintroduced and revamped their characters for a whole new 
generation, my generation.&nbsp;Batman: Year One told the tale of how a young 
rooftop vigilante outlaw became a hero.&nbsp; And it was all set up by the 
mega-event that isCrisis on Infinite Earths.&nbsp; Crisis features the greatest 
super heroes in the world fighting against the greatest threat the world has 
ever seen.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s just epic and a classic comic book story that 
absolutely must be read.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Other tales of great note include: Rom 
the Spaceknight, Avengers: Under Siege, JLA: Rock of Ages, The Sinestro Corps 
War, and Annihilation.<br>
<br>
As I said, these are the tales that the Odinson 
revisits time and time again.&nbsp; They are the tales that inspire and thrill 
me to no end.&nbsp; Whether you are a new reader or a longtime fan, these are 
the Top 10 Must Read Comic Stories of All Time!<br>
<br>
This is Odinson 
bidding thee farewell&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
