<p>Despite this whole thing being in the universe of make believe,given what 
we know of these two titans there's no way in hell that&nbsp;a&nbsp;gamma-ray 
mutation but still&nbsp;mortal&nbsp;Hulk could even come close to taking a 
super advanced,near god-like,alien being like&nbsp;Superman. There is a limit 
to how angry someone gets...even the Hulk and even at his angriest he wouldn't 
be as strong as Superman. No one really knows how strong the man of steel is 
and perhaps neither does he!&nbsp;Many&nbsp;wrongly think that just because 
Hulk is bigger and looks stronger&nbsp;than it means he is stronger. Superman 
can move planets...need I say more! Others believe Hulk would win because 
they're likely Marvel fan boys. Superman has&nbsp;defeated powerful opponents 
like Darkseid,Mongrel,Parasite,Doomsday,and General Zod;several of whom could 
likely take Hulk! Superman has more varied powers and because he's smarter 
can&nbsp;be more resourceful in using them. Speaking of intelligence,how the 
hell can anyone think that Superman isn't smarter than a human,even one as 
brilliant as Dr.Bruce Banner. Superman/Kal-El is not only the son of 
Jor-El,Krypton's most brilliant scientist,but he's outsmarted&nbsp;Lex 
Luthor(one of the smartest people on earth)and Brainiac(the smartest artificial 
being ever created)so yes I think he's smarter than Banner. Even if Hulk 
retained Banner's great intellect,he would still lose because Superman is still 
way smarter and stronger. If the Abomination can knock out Hulk then Superman 
certainly could and in less time!&nbsp;Superman does have tremendous skill in 
combat and wouldn't have defeated&nbsp;extremely skilled opponents like 
Mongrel,Doomsday,and General Zod if he wasn't.&nbsp;He has the 
knowlege&nbsp;the Kryptonian&nbsp;people and that includes their 
advanced&nbsp;combat techniques. Superman is also way the hell faster and would 
be able to easily dodge&nbsp;the strikes of Hulk. I agree with goldeneyez and 
lancedenier among others,Superman would win and it wouldn't be nearly as close 
as&nbsp;many would think.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <br>

<p>I'm going to take that one step farther Keith, though no one will even read 
this probably. But I agree with you in a sense. Sure WISE is completely correct 
that there are numerous types of media out there now compared to in the past, 
but that doesn't mean there wasn't more to do. There were just different things 
to do back then. Either way I suppose you can't compare, but to say there 
wasn't TV or DVD or video games and therefore less things to do isn't entirely 
acurate. Though obviously there is a loss of income for those who have decided 
that movie theaters have become more annoying than rewarding due to moronic 
individuals who only think of themselves and distract you from the movie 
experience and therefore they wait for the DVD. I suppose there were people 
back then that simply avoided the movie experience all together for that same 
reason and just never saw the movie. There would be no way to prove it, but it 
seems logical.</p> 
<p>And Wise you know I think you are Wise so don't think I'm ripping on your 
opinion, if it is your opinion or if you took someone else's opinion and made 
it your own as Evilbeagle might have pointed out, but I'm more or less trying 
to play the devil here and say that I agree that money isn't a way to prove 
which movie is the most successful, but rather the number of people that saw 
it, and maybe more importantly the number of people who saw it and loved it. 
GWTW was voted Paople's choice awards greatest movie of all time, but that was 
in the eighties, the older it gets the less viewers will be around that have 
actually scene it, so I guess things change with time regardless.</p> 
<p>Just a thought. I for one think GWTW is a better movie, but that doesn't 
mean I would chose to watch it over the other.<br>
