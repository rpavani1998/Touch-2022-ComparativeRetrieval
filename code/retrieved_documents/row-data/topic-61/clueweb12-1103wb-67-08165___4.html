 Everyone is good, but NO one can match 
Goku's power! With Spirit bomb, fusion, and his super sayian forms, he is 
unstoppable! Reply<b></b> <br>

 Superman- Definatly, not a contest <br>
Wolverine 
- Has a kickass weapon, but he can't contend against the HULK all by himself.
<br>Megatron - idk <br>
Doomsday - idk <br>
Goku - A Kamehameha wave might 
defeat the HULK Or maybe turning into a Super Saiyan would outmatch the HULK.
<br>Mewtwo - interesting, but idk <br>
Shadow the Hedgehog - He might win with 
his speed<br>
Sonic the Hedgehog - He might win with his speed <br>
Hercules - 
Hard to say here<br>

 Superman- 100% on that. <br>
Wolverine- True: 
Together, The X-Men can defeat the Hulk,especially with Colossus as an 
equalizer.<br>
Megatron- Depending on which version.However, Megatron's more 
clever than he appears to be.<br>
Doomsday- If he can beat the s**t out of 
Superman,Doomsday can beat Hulk without fear due to his immortality(?).<br>

Goku- 100% on that.<br>
Mewtwo- He'll use Psychic on Hulk in a click. <br>

Shadow &amp; Sonic- Speed,Super form,and Chaos Control.<br>
Hercules- Not 
sure,but he'll find a way.<br>

<br>  I think Goku would win, dunno why I think that, just my crazy head logic 
at work. Reply<b></b> <br>

 In his SS4 
form,Goku could pound the Hulk into pudding.<br>
