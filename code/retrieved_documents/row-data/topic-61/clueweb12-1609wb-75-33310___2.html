<p>BEN GRIMM aka THE THING</p> 
<p>Heroic literature exhibits no shortage of strong men. Can I get away with 
calling comic books &quot;heroic literature?&quot; You're reading this at an 
e-zine devoted to fandom, so I don't think I need to persuade you that they 
are. At any rate, throughout the history of comics, no strong man has a 
stronger heart than The Fantastic Four's Ben Grimm a.k.a 'The Thing'.</p> 
<p>Mountainous in stature and covered in hard, orange rock, Ben Grimm, 
Manhattan native, can punch his way through steel just as easily as his 
contemporaries: 'The Hulk', Juggernaut, Hercules or Superman. At one time or 
another he's gone toe to toe with just about everybody - and usually come out 
looking the worse for wear. The Thing falls into that category of superhero 
known to many as &quot;the brick,&quot; the hard, muscle-bound guy (or gal) 
that keeps their feet on the ground punching out robot-tanks and such while his 
cohorts - &quot;the brain,&quot; &quot;the blaster,&quot; etc. - swirl, swoop 
and fly around him. Historical examples include Gawain to Lancelot, Little John 
to Robin Hood. Certainly, the stocky sidekick archetype is Ben Grimm to a T.</p>
<p>As part of the Fantastic Four, Ben's job is to run back up or absorb blows 
for Reed Richards, the elastic Mr. Fantastic (the brain); Johnny Storm, the 
Human Torch (the blaster); and Sue Storm/Richards, Invisible Girl (a kind of 
handy but by no means underestimated accessory and den mother). He's also the 
voice of the proletariat in this otherwise white-collar, middle-class club. 
Misshapen and &quot;ugly&quot; where his teammates are handsome. Ben is the 
&quot;Yancy Streeter&quot; with the &quot;New Yawk&quot; accent that counters 
Reed's Princeton lab-speak. &quot;Put it in plain English to me, Stretch!&quot; 
he complains, confronted with Dr. Doom's latest machine of destruction. 
&quot;Whatta we gotta do ta stop this thingummy?!&quot;</p> 
<p>Ben Grimm always comes off as much the FF's servant as their friend. Even 
before the space encounter that transformed them from ordinary astronauts this 
was so; of all the roles on the ship, Ben was the pilot. The chauffeur. Indeed, 
Ben's gutter talk was intended to provide comic relief - his verbal sparring 
with Johnny an ongoing joke all the more poignant on those occasions when 
Johnny's high-flying antics would have to pull Ben out of the fire, so to 
speak. But Ben's usefulness to the FF saga runs much deeper than that.</p> 
<p>In fact, he took center-stage shortly after The Fantastic Four launched in 
the early 60s, overtaking Johnny as the fan favorite and eventually earning his 
own series. What makes The Thing such an enduring character is his appeal to 
the common people. Don't let his wisecracks fool you - he is not indifferent to 
his ugliness, his sense of other. He spends a great deal of his time lamenting 
the fact that he must remain unadored while babe-alicious blond Storm counts 
devotees by the score and the Richards' have each other. He feels like a 
monster that, unlike the Hulk, can never change back. Only a romance with blind 
sculptress Alicia Masters helps him break through this feeling of ugliness and 
otherness. The sensitive heart that beats within the orange chest - a heart 
that is not unlike our own in that it feels deeply the wounds of a society that 
actively seeks to ostracize the different or the &quot;unattractive&quot; - is 
what gives the Thing his cathartic appeal.</p> 
<p>For who has not felt like Ben at one time or another? Who has not been 
taunted, pushed out, ignored? And who among us has not wished that somehow in 
our otherness we were empowered, like The Thing was empowered? That the 
compensation for our lack of beauty included enormous physical strength and 
toughness? That the fact that we were called &quot;four eyes&quot; or 
&quot;fatty&quot; did not entitle us to powerful arms and a resilient hide, 
hands to crush and X-ray eyes to burn?</p> 
<p>It is his humanity that pushes Ben further than the other traditional 
bricks. The Hulk is rage personified - he burns out, confused, returns to 
earth, and is never quite in control of himself. The X-Men's Colossus is 
eloquent, shiny, malleable, and a chrome Adonis. Superman? Perfection. Forget 
it, he has no place among the troglodytes of this world. Only The Thing really 
suffers, and out of this suffering is born his greatest strengths, like the 
boxer that is outclassed from the first bell but fights valiantly and 
hopelessly all the way to the twelfth - which The Thing has done time and time 
again, against Hulk, against Juggernaut, against himself.</p> 
<p>Some bricks are stronger and some more eloquent; certainly many are more 
powerful, more popular. Few are more enduring, and more sympathetic, than The 
Thing. Even less are more &quot;like us folks&quot; than this multifaceted man 
and his complicated web of feelings. With such trademark quips as &quot;You 
couldn't out punch my aunt Petunia&quot; and the immortal &quot;It's clobberin' 
time!&quot; Ben Grimm has secured his place in the sagas as handily as he has 
secured his place in our hearts, as brutally as he once toppled Galactus! The 
&quot;ever-lovin', blue-eyed Thing.&quot;</p> 
<p>The Character Dossier series of columns is an ongoing examination of 
characters we love, from comics, film, literature, television or other, and why 
we love them.</p> <br>
