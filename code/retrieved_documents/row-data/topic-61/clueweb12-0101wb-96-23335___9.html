<p><b></b></p> <b>Why Doesn't Green Lantern Eliminate Evil?<br>
 (2/6/94)</b> 
<p></p> 
<p> I posted the following messages in CompuServe's Comics Forum beginning in 
February 1994. As I recall, the occasion was the destruction of Coast City, Hal 
Jordan's subsequent killing spree, and the introduction of Kyle Rayner. I used 
the occasion to start some conversations about whether the Green Lantern 
concept worked and how to fix it.</p> 
<p>I saved some of my correspondents' messages, but not all of them. Their 
short comments are in brackets; their longer comments are indented. Mine are in 
italics or the regular font. If something isn't clear, I've tried to annotate 
it to make it clearer.</p> 
<p></p>  ***** 
<p></p> 
<p><i>First, on Hal Jordan's killing people.</i></p> 
<p>The point is that anything in comic books, including death and more, can be 
reversed, so I wouldn't worry<i>too</i> much. Which is not to say that I agree 
with every change. I don't believe that Clark Kent, Hal Jordan, Steve Rogers, 
or Peter Parker&#151;i.e., any true hero&#151;would go off the deep end for any 
reason. But then, I've never seen my city destroyed, so that's a bit beyond my 
comprehension, too.</p> 
<p>Just to be contrary, I must say that Green Lantern has never struck me as 
the most exciting or meaningful book in the past. I enjoyed the stories where 
Englehart et al. destroyed and then rebuilt the GL Corps. Maybe this will turn 
out well, too.</p> 
<p></p>  ***** 
<p></p> 
<p><i>Why has the second GL series failed?</i></p> 
<p>I think it's because GL is a tough character to make interesting and 
appealing. Basically, if he has or uses enough will power, he can do anything. 
He could alter everyone's brains and make them happy (or at least not mentally 
disturbed), teleport any opponent into a jail cell, etc. Writers have to 
&quot;dumb down&quot; his stories and put artificial limitations on his 
intelligence and abilities, just as they did with the pre-Crisis Superman. Then 
the stories become bland and unbelievable and have to be spiced up by 
sensational stunts and gimmicks.</p> 
<p>IMHO, it's easier to write about human characters like Batman or Wolverine 
than about demigods like Superman, GL, Thor, or Silver Surfer.</p> 
<p></p>  ***** 
<p></p> 
<p><i>When, if ever, did the GL series work?</i></p> 
<p>Well, I'd have to favor the Adams years, myself. I'd say GL <i>really</i> 
needs the humanizing influence of Green Arrow, John Stewart, Guy Gardner, the 
rest of the Corps, or even Itty. I just don't think he works as a solo 
character.</p> 
<p>From GL to the New Gods to &quot;Star Wars,&quot; there haven't been many 
successful sci-fi/space opera comic books, have there? I think it's because 
these series inevitably favor plot and action over characterization.</p> 
<p>Anyway, a temporary insanity plea will cure this phase. Check back in about 
five years. Or how about this: The green power has a corrupting 
element/influence that drives anyone who uses it insane. Look at John Stewart 
in &quot;Cosmic Odyssey,&quot; Guy Gardner, Sinestro, the Old Timer, or the 
Guardians themselves. Once this impurity is removed, everyone's healthy again 
and no one is blamed for his actions &quot;under the influence.&quot;</p> 
<p></p>  ***** 
<p></p> 
<p>GREEN LANTERN #50 upheld<br>
 Okay, I'll stick foot in mouth and invite a 
horde of ring-slingers....</p> 
<p>I agree with this statement in the letters page of GL #50: &quot;In all the 
years that Hal has been in existence, there has been little change, if any, to 
the character.&quot; So where's the beef?</p> 
<p>That Hal went crazy? People, Hal's been a lackey all his life. The 
Guardians have told him when to jump, and he's asked how high. He's been 
ordered to ignore personal responsibilities to attend to crises. He's been 
exiled to space for a year. He's had his power stripped. Face it, he's been 
used...toyed with...manipulated to extremes.</p> 
<p>Now Clark Kent or Barry Allen might have tolerated this, but Bruce Wayne or 
Oliver Queen never would have. In other words, a stronger character would have 
rebelled long ago. Part of being a hero is saying no. Hal destroyed seven 
million dollars' worth of planes when one man died (GL #89, original series); 
how should he react to the death of a city? He's been pushed too far, and now 
he's rebelling.</p> 
<p>That Hal killed? Superman killed the Phantom Zone criminals a few years 
back. Don't ask when, but I suspect Batman, Green Arrow, Hawkman, Wonder Woman, 
and other DC heroes have killed before, if only by letting people die through 
inaction. If one favors capitol punishment, one could argue that Sinestro 
deserved it.</p> 
<p>As for Kilowog, that <i>does</i> seem inexcusable and unnecessary. But Hal 
said he had left enough power for the others whom he had attacked to survive. 
Do we know for a fact that Kilowog's race can't regenerate from a smidgen of 
protoplasm? Do we know that Hal didn't blast him just for dramatic effect, then 
restore him off-panel? No death is irreversible if a writer doesn't want it to 
be.</p> 
<p>Besides, Hal was clearly spaced out, demented, not in control of his 
faculties. He was ranting like a fool at one point. A good lawyer could easily 
get him acquitted on the grounds of temporary insanity. And, of course, he 
could have contracted &quot;green power ring disease,&quot; for all we know.</p>
<p>That Hal is no longer Green Lantern? Tell it to Barry Allen, Bruce Wayne, 
and Dick Grayson. That he has a new costume? So does Batman, Hawkman, Alan 
Scott/GL, and Green Arrow. A new name? Okay, &quot;Green Flame&quot; (?) is 
mediocre, but how about Nightwing, Valor, the Legionnaires, and Arsenal 
(Speedy)? It happens, people; it's not the end of the world.</p> 
<p>GREEN LANTERN needs a drastic change, IMHO. The changes in the past have 
not been enough, and subsequent writers have mostly undone them. The Guardians 
of the Galaxy are an inhibiting and almost unworkable concept: If they exist, 
GL should spend 99% of his time patrolling his sector, and the GL Corps should 
intervene every time Mongul, the Dominators, the Missile Men, or whoever 
invades the Earth.</p> 
<p>Hal Jordan is arguably the senior statesman of DC heroes; therefore, 
doesn't he deserve to be more than just one of a group? Doesn't he deserve to 
be unique? His book often teeters on the edge of cancelation; doesn't that 
suggest it's time to do something different? Change is usually good for a book. 
Superman proposed to Lois; Robin, the Titans, and the Legion grew up; 
Supergirl, Flash, Karate Kid, and Jericho died. We're all still here.</p> 
<p>Sometimes characters need to get stronger and nastier (Guy Gardner, 
Hawkman, Doc Magnus, Storm, Hulk, Invisible Woman). Sometimes they need to get 
weaker and more vulnerable (Superman, Batman/Bruce Wayne, Flash/Wally West, 
Wolverine). Change has worked for years at Marvel (look at almost any book). DC 
is finally catching up.</p> 
<p>The Guardians have claimed in the past that they know the future of the 
universe, that everything is part of their master plan. Perhaps this is, 
too&#151;especially since it seems established that a GL Corps will exist 
sometime in the future. I, for one, am not going to burn my entire comic book 
collection in front of DC's headquarters. I'll keep reading.</p> 
<p>(You understand that this is all idle rhetoric, I hope. Please don't send 
me hate mail. I liked the old GL, and I'll watch the new one with curiosity.)
</p> 
<p></p>  ***** 
<p></p> 
<p>Is the ring limited or unlimited?<br>
 I wish the ring <i>were</i> limited 
in power, as it would make for more dramatic stories. GL can travel faster than 
light with it, which is akin to teleportation. He shrank himself to atomic size 
and slipped between the molecules of a gold casing once. He communicates with 
the ring and with other races telepathically, so mind control seems eminently 
possible. As I said, the character has always been too inherently powerful his 
own good, IMHO. Same with Superman&#151;with his super-speed, he could put 
almost any villain out of commission before the bad guy could blink. And note 
that GL can also travel at super-speed, though no one ever employs that aspect 
of his power.</p> 
<p></p>  ***** 
<p></p> 
<p><i>Should DC try something radical with GL?</i></p> 
<p>They already partnered GL with a mere mortal, gave his ring to someone 
else, destroyed and rebuilt the GL Corps, etc. Isn't it time for something 
radical? (Or maybe it's simply time for a top writer. I'm sure Alan Moore or 
someone like him could do wonders with the GL concept.)</p> 
<p></p>  ***** 
<p></p> 
<p><i>What would *I* do if DC put me in charge?</i></p> 
<p>Well, now, <i>that's</i> a tough, and open-ended, question. I don't know if 
there's enough time in the day to tackle it. But perhaps together we can come 
up with anything.</p> 
<p>First, since the Corps and rings are going through so many changes, I don't 
think you have to violate or ignore past stories. Simply say that GL has wasted 
or leaked some of the green energy away, and the rings will no longer do what 
they could before.</p> 
<p>How about this? Let's say that the ring should only be able to create solid 
objects&#151;i.e., shapes that have physical substance, hardness, density, or 
whatever. That's primarily what Hal Jordan has used it for, anyway (others have 
used it differently, pointing out Hal's lack of imagination). In this case, the 
ring could create a protective bubble, but not a magnetic field. It could cause 
a fire by rubbing two sticks together, but not by generating heat directly. GL 
could travel through space by creating a space vehicle, but not by willing 
himself to go faster than light.</p> 
<p>This would remove GL's ability to change matter directly and to generate 
various forms of energy (including telepathic waves). We might also leave the 
ring the ability to &quot;think&quot; independently, so it could supply 
information or translate speech. It would act much like a sophisticated 
computer, and have just that much ability.</p> 
<p>Now it's your turn. I might add that Quasar, whom I consider Marvel's GL, 
has the same problem. But at least his writer, Mark Gruenwald, has written a 
whole treatise on what Quasar's quantum bands can and can't do.</p> 
<p></p>  ***** 
<p></p> 
<p>I think if a character sucks, and lesser remedies have been tried, radical 
changes are necessary. I'd argue that DC's Flash, GL, Hawkman, Atom, Aquaman, 
and quite a few other characters sucked and were in need of surgery. Does 
anybody recall the Terminator's battles with GL, Superman, et al.? There was a 
real character, with pain, blood, and flaws, dealing with cardboard cutouts.</p>
<p></p>  ***** 
<p></p> 
<p>Is Kilowog dead?<br>
<i>A message written soon after Hal Jordan 
&quot;killed&quot; Kilowog and other Green Lanterns.</i></p> 
<p>I still wouldn't count Kilowog out. Surgery will take care of Boodikka just 
fine. The Guardians have acted confused before, only to claim later that it was 
part of the plan. (Call it a continuity glitch if you wish, but there you have 
it.)</p> 
<p>As I said, I don't know if this change will work, either. I would have 
tried something less daring myself, if I had been in charge. Or simply put a 
better writer on the job. (When O'Neil and Adams were on the team, I had no 
doubts about GL's viability.) But I won't blame DC for trying something 
radical, only for doing it in an apparently tactless or unfair (to Gerald 
Jones) way.</p> 
<p></p>  ***** 
<p></p> 
<p><i>More on the 24-hour limitation.</i></p> 
<p>I think we could live without the 24-hour charge, as it only serves to give 
GL a chance to recite his oath dramatically. But I don't mind it. I liken the 
ring to a computer because it performs certain functions automatically or upon 
orders but doesn't think independently.</p> 
<p>As I said in another message, I would suggest limiting the power of the 
ring further to increase the dramatic possibilities of Green Lantern.</p> 
<p></p>  ***** 
<p></p> 
<p><i>More on how the ring works.</i></p> 
<p>Knowledge of how to do something obviously isn't necessary, unless Hal 
Jordan has taken classes in celestial navigation, warp creation, or 
faster-than-light travel. You give the ring a goal; it figures out how to do 
it. Sometimes, that is. A flaw of the &quot;limitless ring,&quot; IMHO.</p> 
<p></p>  ***** 
<p></p> 
<p>As I said in another reply, I would cut down on the ring's main capability, 
rather than imposing artificial limitations. I don't know what &quot;they&quot; 
will do in the series. Both those limitations do seem artificial to me when I 
think about them. Couldn't GL program his ring to teleport him back to his 
power battery, say, after 23 hours? And, as he's done once in a while (i.e., 
inconsistently), can't GL always coat a yellow object with soot, dust, or dirt 
and thus change its color?</p> 
<p></p>  ***** 
<p></p> 
<p>Hal Jordan has done any number of effects that can't be explained by his 
&quot;knowledge.&quot; I'm sure he's willed up planes, cars, skyscrapers, 
bulldozers, blast furnaces, and acetylane torches, none of which he presumably 
knows how to construct. Furthermore, he's shrunk himself, built force fields, 
etc. He doesn't &quot;know&quot; any of this; he thinks &quot;car&quot; or 
&quot;force field&quot; and the ring supplies the knowledge, the energy, and 
the mechanics. So, since the ring can &quot;do anything,&quot; how much more 
far-fetched is it for the ring to cure disease (by destroying microorganisms), 
wipe a mind (by rewiring brain cells), or eliminate someone's immortality (by 
eliminating whatever the immortality factor is in the subject's cells)?</p> 
<p></p>  ***** 
<p></p> 
<p>Shades of the old Iron &quot;I only have three ergs of energy left&quot; 
Man! Thor's one minute, Aquaman's one hour...I don't think<i>any</i> of these 
artificial limits has ever worked. Can anyone give an example of one that has?
</p> 
<p></p>  ***** 
<p></p> 
<p>Those comic-book gimmicks<br>
 I don't mind those limitations either, but I 
have a vague sense that they've never really worked well. Haven't latter-day 
writers striven to do away with the time limits on Thor and Aquaman, as well as 
Iron Man's heart attacks, the Surfer's being bound to Earth, and even 
Superman's kryptonite? I suggest that a character should be compromised by his 
own fear and ignorance, not by some plot device.</p> 
<p></p>  ***** 
<p></p> 
<p>What about those times when GL does something other than create a solid 
object, though? Like the time he shrunk himself&#151;does he have to know how 
to do it, or does he just give the order and let the ring figure it out? If the 
latter, then I think you're on<i>really</i> shaky ground. Why couldn't he dream 
up an anti-crime or an anti-poverty machine and let it do its stuff? He 
wouldn't have to know how it worked, according to you, just what the result 
was. The same with the suggestion about a GL's eliminating someone's 
immortality&#151;does he have to understand the mechanics of immortality to do 
away with it, or simply the desired result? Could he will himself to be 
immortal, just by thinking it? Could he bring someone back to life? (Life is a 
chemical process, after all, so if GL doesn't have to know the exact mechanics 
of it, he ought to be able to will it into existence.)</p> 
<p>As for &quot;rewiring brain cells,&quot; that was supposed to be a pretty 
nonscientific explanation. Okay, could GL change the serotonin levels of 
certain synaptic receptors in the hypothalamus region...? IMO, the details 
don't matter, but brain activity is a electrochemical function, and therefore 
GL's ring should be able to affect it.</p> 
<p>And we know it can, because he's made people forget unpleasant things many 
times. Why not make them (heck, the world) &quot;forget&quot; how to commit 
crimes permanently?</p> 
<p>Comment (5/24/02): &nbsp;Kevin Smith's recent GREEN ARROW only cements the 
point. Green Lantern/Parallax either brought Green Arrow back to life or 
created a new Green Arrow, depending how you look at it. So why not bring some 
or all of Coast City's residents back to life the same way? Bring them back to 
life, undone all the wrongs done, and erase the &quot;evil&quot; from your 
mind? Hal doesn't have to lament the past, since he can recreate it.</p> 
<p>Similarly, why not end death for some or all of humanity? If someone dies 
and GL deems the person worthy enough, he brings the person back to life just 
as he did Green Arrow. Viol&aacute;...GL has undone God's handiwork. God kills, 
GL reanimates.</p> 
<p>Kevin Smith has made the implicit explicit. Green Lantern literally can be 
a god if he musters enough willpower. But is a comic about God foiling a bank 
robbery likely to make sense? Or to sell well? No to both questions.</p> 
<p></p>  ***** 
<p></p> 
<p><i>How lame is the ring's yellow weakness?</i></p> 
<p>Good comment about &quot;yellow pigment.&quot; Really, in addition to 
covering any yellow object with dust motes, GL can either darken a room or 
place a green filter between the light source and the yellow object. Voila, no 
more yellow object! As Metamorpho said in his battle with Guy Gardner, there's 
any number of ways to stop a yellow character. (Too bad Guy was too stupid to 
think of any of them.)</p> 
<p></p>  ***** 
<p></p> 
<p>So you think the brain is too delicate for a ring to &quot;operate&quot; 
on? But, again, if GL doesn't have to know the methodology, just the result, it 
would be up to the ring to manage the intricacies. GL wouldn't have to think 
about it on a conscious level.</p> 
<p></p>  ***** 
<p></p> 
<p><i>Hal Jordan/Parallax's new oath</i></p> 
<p>In brightest day, in blackest night,<br>
 No GL shall escape my sight.<br>
 
Let those who worship lantern's light,<br>
 Beware my power: Hal Jordan's might.
</p> 
<p></p>  ***** 
<p></p> 
<p>Customized GLs?<br>
 I'd like to see something that a few GL writers have 
hinted at&#151;namely, that each ring acts according to the philosophy/world 
view of the bearer. Only I would make that a limitation, the<i>only</i> thing 
the ring could do.</p> 
<p>For instance, Hal Jordan is a pragmatist and thinks in terms of things he 
can see and touch. I would go with this and limit him<i>only</i> to creating 
solid objects. No heat beams, magnetic beams, telepathic beams, etc. Kilowog, 
who I believe was a physicist, would be just the opposite. His ring could 
create or negate heat, magnetism, gravity, etc. but could<i>not</i> create 
solid objects. A GL who was a poet, OTOH, wouldn't be able to do either of 
these things; instead she could create abstract patterns of green light that 
could alter one's emotions, perceptions, and thought processes. And so forth.
</p> 
<p>Under this scheme, each GL would be (somewhat) unique and each would have 
some limitation on his power. It would work best with about 12 GLs, each with a 
different approach. Seeing how each GL solved a problem would become a 
fascinating exercise rather than a predictable bore.</p> 
<p></p>  ***** 
<p></p> 
<p>I don't mind a character who grows weaker after using his power, but I 
think the minute or hour cutoffs are poor. &quot;Ohmithundergod, is Thor going 
to turn into Don Blake and die?&quot; Well, probably not. Whereas if a 
character, especially a team character, grows weak, it allows other characters 
to move to the fore. I imagine this is how it would actually be in a team 
effort.</p> 
<p>Chris Claremont did great things with characters whose powers initially 
&quot;wore out,&quot; giving them training so they gradaully and realistically 
extended the scope of their abilities.</p> 
<p>The Mimic I would accept because employing his power required continuing 
strategy&#151;stay in touch with one hero or switch to another. Same reason I 
think Ultra Boy is a &quot;good&quot; superhero&#151;his power requires thought 
and planning to be used to best effect. Having to pop a pill, spin a dial, or 
jump back into the water doesn't strike me as analogous. It's a do-or-die, 
no-brainer choice, not a continuing catalyst for strategizing. &quot;Gotta find 
water, gotta find water&quot;...and next time, it's &quot;Gotta find water, 
gotta find water&quot; again.</p> 
<p></p>  ***** 
<p></p> 
<p><i>Moving on to March 1994's messages. At some point I discussed an Alan 
Scott story in which he willed the ring to &quot;remove evil.&quot; It removed 
every person from earth. I suggested this dodged the issue and a clever GL 
really could eliminate evil.</i></p> 
<p><i>That raised a firestorm of protest. A correspondent suggested GL has to 
know exactly what he's doing before he does it. So he couldn't just alter 
people's thought processes.</i></p> 
<p>So you assume that some GL in the past knew the actual physical means of 
shrinking oneself, and has passed it on? That's certainly possible, but it's 
also possible that Hal Jordan invented the strategm, that (if some writer says 
so) the ring can do it just because Hal wills it. How do we know?</p> 
<p>As for the human psyche, it <i>is</i> subject to will power, isn't it? It's 
also subject to chemical manipulation (drugs), which is not beyond the power of 
GL's ring. He once emitted kryptonite rays, which are nothing but a series of 
subatomic particles. Why not serotonin molecules as well? In fact, the human 
psyche<i>is</i> subject to mechanical means; surgeons sometimes remove part of 
the brain and alter a person's personality, which a GL ring could do also. And 
psyches are subject to electrical stimulation, as in electro-shock therapy, 
which a GL ring could certainly duplicate.</p> 
<p></p>  ***** 
<p></p> 
<p>GL ring needs rules<br>
<i>Someone thinks I've digressed from my own 
subject.</i></p> 
<p>I'm discussing everything the ring can or can't do, which is not merely 
limited to creating physical objects. The questions I'm responding to asked 
what people thought were the canonical abilities of the ring and if/how they 
should change. No one limited the discussion to physical objects, least of all 
me.</p> 
<p>My contention is that without strict definitions, any other contention 
about GL's powers is flawed. If he could create a defibrillator, whose 
mechanics he probably doesn't understand, why not any other machine whose 
mechanics he doesn't understand as well? Could he create Orion's Mother Box? 
Omac's Brother Eye? The Legion's Miracle Machine? I don't see why not, since 
he's created spaceships that must be almost as complex.</p> 
<p>And are you insisting that he is limited to physical objects, when he has 
obviously emitted light, heat, and other forms of energy from his ring? All 
biological and chemical processes involve matter and energy, and he can clearly 
manipulate both.</p> 
<p></p>  ***** 
<p></p> 
<p><i>Someone again suggests that GL's will isn't enough. &quot;He may have 
the will to create the Miracle Machine and so forth, but the skill is another 
matter.&quot; Or words to that effect.</i></p> 
<p>&quot;Having the skill&quot; is <i>not</i> another matter, IMHO. He doesn't 
have the skill to do most of the things he does, unless you contend that Hal 
has advanced degrees in physics, engineering, geology, architecture, munitions, 
navigation, etc. The ring supplies the skills in many if not most cases. As in 
the Alan Scott story about removing evil from Earth, Scott had no idea how to 
remove evil himself. The ring interpreted the command and executed the wish, 
removing all the people from Earth. So what if Alan Scott had said, &quot;No, 
stupid ring, leave the people on Earth, but remove those parts of their brains 
that are causing the negative thoughts&quot;? I assume the ring could do it.</p>
<p></p>  ***** 
<p></p> 
<p><i>More on customized GLs.</i></p> 
<p>&quot;My&quot; idea is based partly on the Alan Moore story about the 
female GL who intervened on a totally dark world. Since light couldn't 
penetrate there, the ring was useless, but she made it into a Green Bell that 
emitted sound waves rather than light. Just think, we could have a Green 
Lantern, Green Bell, Green Pepper, Green Jeans....</p> 
<p></p>  ***** 
<p></p> 
<p><i>Again someone thinks GL needs precise knowledge of what he's doing.</i>
</p> 
<p>To create the illusion of a working car, fan, or something that just moves, 
you make a copy and move it. To create a copy of an energy effect, you have to 
know how the energy works (within reason&#151;heat and light are somewhat 
simple, and are probably understood by the ring).</p> 
<p>So to create a ring-powered machine to destroy evil, you have to know how 
to destroy evil. Therefore, it isn't done.</p> 
<p>If GL doesn't have to create a working car, if he doesn't even have to know 
how it works, if he merely creates a shell made of energy, then why couldn't he 
construct an anti-evil machine (i.e., a Miracle Machine&#151;in other words, 
such a machine<i>is</i> possible in the DC universe) and power it with his 
will? I don't see the difference between that and a car; they're both machines. 
What it all seems to boil down to is that Hal<i>could</i> do as I've suggested 
if he had enough will; there are no physical limitations.</p> 
<p></p>  ***** 
<p></p> 
<p><i>Kyle Rayner's oath</i></p> 
<p>In, uh, day, evening, night,<br>
 How 'bout Green Lantern's light?<br>
 
Dude, let's do it right,<br>
 You know, fight, fight, fight!</p> 
<p></p>  ***** 
<p></p> 
<p>Limited heroes = good idea<br>
<i>Someone suggests many IRON MAN and THOR 
stories didn't overuse the characters' physical limitations.</i></p> 
<p>Dang, I must have read all the bad IRON MAN and THOR stories and missed all 
the good ones.</p> 
<p>I agree with you completely about the value of &quot;limited&quot; 
superheroes&#151;the few I've created and the ones I'd like to write would be 
all like that. That's my problem with characters like GL or Thor&#151;they're 
basically unlimited in power. I just don't think the arbitrary limitations work 
as well as what I'd call &quot;organic&quot; or &quot;natural&quot; 
limitations. Saying the Flash can run at Mach 5 (or whatever) is a natural 
limitation to me. Saying he couldn't run on yellow brick roads would be 
arbitrary.</p> 
<p>For instance, if we limited Hal Jordan to creating physical objects only, 
he'd have to think of new and inventive ways to overcome problems all the time. 
In contrast, the 24-hour limit imposes the<i>same</i> storytelling problem 
every time: He's got to run away and recharge. Of course a good writer can 
think of clever variations on the time-limit problem, but I think you'd find, 
as time went by, that you'd use up your 24-hour-limit stories and start 
ignoring the device. Because that's what it seems to me, a device.</p> 
<p></p>  ***** 
<p></p> 
<p>I think you articulated the problem well. It doesn't exactly drive me up a 
tree, but I think it weakens the character. You never know whether he'll take 
charge in any situation or &quot;forget&quot; all the wonderful tricks he can 
do and thus get himself hurt or captured. When the reader can outthink the 
hero, come up with better solutions, it interrupts the suspension of belief. 
It's much like the 24-hour limit. Anytime the writer wants, he can say, 
&quot;Whoops, 24 hours are almost up. GL's in trouble.&quot; And he can also 
say, &quot;All GL can do is hammers, tongs, and flyswatters. Looks like the bad 
guy's got him beat.&quot;</p> 
<p>When the same guy can beat Mongul and lose to Deathstroke the Terminator, 
something's wrong, IMHO.</p> 
<p></p>  ***** 
<p></p> 
<p><i>Another correspondent tries again to explain GL's ring.</i></p> 
<p>GL knows what a defibrillator does, even if he doesn't understand the 
process by which it does it: It sends an electric shock to the heart muscle.</p>
<p>He DOESN'T have the slightest idea what the full abilities of the Mother 
Box are, or Brother Eye, or the Miracle Machine. He might be able to duplicate 
any function or set of functions he has seen them perform, but not duplicate 
the entire range of functions.</p> 
<p>Unless, of course, he has&#151;in the past&#151;asked the ring to analyze 
and store the inner workings of such devices, and then asks the ring to 
duplicate them in toto.</p> 
<p>But GL has created spaceships before, hasn't he? He just happens to know 
the physical principles of faster-than-light travel? And Allan Lappin has said 
he creates only the shell of a car, for instance, not a true working car. So is 
GL creating a working defibrillator, or a shell of a defibrillator (i.e., is he 
shocking someone with his ring directly, but simply making it look like a 
defibrillator is acting for some arbitrary reason)?</p> 
<p>Comment (5/24/02): &nbsp;These correspondents need to get their stories 
straight. Then they need to rethink them. We all agree GL can create a 
modern-day machine: a car, a jet, or a television. Does he have to know exactly 
how television works? Does he have to know roughly how it works (machines 
deassemble a picture, transmit it, and reassemble it)? Is it enough to create a 
&quot;shell&quot; of a television and let the ring fill in the technological 
details? Or can he simply think &quot;television&quot; and let the ring do the 
rest?</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>Our correspondents don't agree. If they did agree, their answer would be 
wrong, since GL has created things when he didn't know how they worked. He's 
created animals such as elephants and lions, as well as energy duplicates of 
himself, for example. Does he know an elephant's biochemistry? Its anatomy and 
musculature? Of course not...yet the power-ring elephants behave just like 
actual elephants. That's because he imagines a result and the ring fills in the 
details.</p> 
<p>GL also has done things that are flatly impossible, such as shrinking 
himself to subatomic size. It doesn't matter whether he knows how to do this or 
tells the ring to produce the final result, since the task violates the laws of 
physics. Physicists are at least talking about wormholes and time travel being 
theoretically possible, which makes them more possible than shrinking. Yet GL 
can shrink himself even though he can't know the unknowable mechanics of 
shrinking.</p> 
<p>Upshot: GL doesn't have to know how a defibrillator, a Mother Box, or a 
time machine works. If a ring can create a space warp or telepathic waves, it 
can create anything he can imagine. The evidence seems pretty clear on that 
point. (If nothing else, GL could order his ring to scan Mister Miracle's 
Mother Box and create a duplicate of it.)</p> 
<p></p>  ***** 
<p></p> 
<p>How would GL eliminate evil?<br>
<i>Someone asks exactly how GL would 
remove evil.</i></p> 
<p>How? The brain doesn't function like that. There isn't an &quot;evil&quot; 
cortex ala Doc Savage; you can't remove a specific ganglia and leave the person 
alive with skills and memory intact, but the personality altered so that he'll 
never look at the woman next door with lust in his heart again.</p> 
<p>Worse, how do you define evil? Is killing a man who was trying to strangle 
your wife to death evil? Is eating meat on Fridays during Lent evil? *That* was 
the beauty of the Alan Scott story.</p> 
<p>I don't know about &quot;evil,&quot; but think of it as a metaphor for 
other things. Doctors<i>have</i> cured someone (perhaps accidentally) of 
violent tendencies by removing part of the brain. Doctors treat depression by 
directing chemicals to a particular part of the brain. These actions<i>may</i> 
affect the person's skills and memories or they may not. I don't expect a ring 
to literally excise every &quot;evil cell&quot; and leave every &quot;good 
cell&quot; intact. But I imagine a ring could affect those parts of the brain 
that cause sad, negative, or violent thoughts and dampen them enough so a 
person would become functional.</p> 
<p>Comment (5/24/02): &nbsp;The so-called beauty of the Alan Scott story is 
stupid if you think about. So it's tough to define &quot;evil&quot;...so? The 
ring defined it by removing the entire person, implying they were evil through 
and through.</p> 
<p>Is a newborn baby evil? Yes, according to some Christians, but not 
according to others. How about an unborn fetus? An unfertilized egg? A 
chimpanzee clever enough to disobey a human master's rule? How about a dog? A 
trained parakeet? Trained fish? Trained flea? Etc. Evil, or not?</p> 
<p>No good answer is possible, but I'd love to hear someone try. The Alan 
Scott story failed to address the issue in any meaningful way. A better 
solution might've been for the ring to explode or implode&#151;because the 
definition of &quot;evil&quot; was so paradoxical the ring couldn't handle it.
</p> 
<p>Tell me how GL communicates telepathically with Oa or travels faster than 
light and I'll tell you how he removes evil. By magical fiat, that's how. If 
that's not sufficient, the ring excises whichever brain cells and chemicals 
that create the thoughts and feelings that Alan Scott deems &quot;evil.&quot; 
End of story.</p>

<p>&gt;&gt; Did Hal really create kryptonite radiation with his ring. What 
issue was this. Under what circumstances did he do it? &lt;&lt;</p> 
<p>ACTION #437. An evil magician was blackmailing Superman into doing his 
bidding, and summoned GL and Flash for &quot;sport.&quot; Superman won in the 
end.</p> 
<p>Interestingly, Supes determined that GL's kryptonite radiation was 
&quot;artificial,&quot; and thus could be blocked by his yellow &quot;S&quot; 
emblem. That seems to raise as many questions as it answers. Could a yellow 
wall (or sheet of paper) block artificial magnetism from GL's ring? Artificial 
heat?</p>

<p>Power ring facts<br>
 Here are some things a Green Lantern can do with his 
power ring. He can:</p> 
<li>read someone's mind;</li> <br>

<li>have his ring search a city for someone he has only a (mental) picture of;
</li> <br>

<li>make his body nebulous enough for solid objects to pass through;</li> <br>

<li>shrink himself;</li> <br>

<li>transmit matter into other matter (his clothes, for instance) or create 
matter out of thin air;</li> <br>

<li>control people's minds and tell them what to do;</li> <br>

<li>trace gravity and other energy waves to their source;</li> <br>

<li>distinguish a single person's footsteps from all other vibrations;</li> 
<br> 
<li>emit kryptonite rays;</li> <br>

<li>stop a world's core from blowing up.
<p></p> 
<p>All this courtesy of GL (original series) #60, #67, and a few other 
selected issues.</p> 
<p>Given this, I submit that GL can do literally anything he wants if he has 
enough will power. Hal Jordan, for instance, has no physical or mental idea of 
how to accomplish the above tasks. He simply &quot;wishes&quot; for a result 
and the ring does it without Hal's having the slightest clue how. (Indeed, most 
of these actions are beyond human understanding.)</p> 
<p>Therefore, there is no reason Hal couldn't order a single person, if not 
the entire world, not to commit an evil act again (&quot;evil&quot; being as 
Hal defined it). There is no reason he couldn't create food for everyone or 
eradicate all disease. I don't think there's any reason he couldn't bring 
someone back to life or will himself to be immortal, either. None of these seem 
inherently more difficult than transmuting matter or preventing a world from 
exploding.</p>

<p><i>Rob introduces a contest about GL's ring, 3/12/94.</i></p> 
<p>&quot;How does Green Lantern escape?&quot;</p> 
<p>You are Green Lantern. You've been very, very naughty (perhaps you've wiped 
out most of the GL Corps). You are imprisoned in a cell in interstellar space 
beyond the gravitational field of any solar system. The cell is a solid cube 
with a hollowed-out interior and walls at least a foot thick, colored a 
luminescent yellow inside and out. Your ring has a 24-hour charge but you have 
only 12 hours of air left. What do you do?</p> 
<p>(Hint: There are at least <i>ten</i> different ways for GL to escape this 
cell. Good luck!)</p> 
<p></p>  ***** 
<p></p> 
<p>Answers begin coming in<br>
 &gt;&gt; Hmmm, how about you use your power 
ring to slash your wrists and splash your blood around your cell. This turns 
the cell's interior into a different color (red) and then you use your power 
ring to bust out (If you have any blood left!) &lt;&lt;</p> 
<p>Yes, that is solution #1! It includes all the obvious alternatives such as 
using his hair, skin, feces (ugh), costume, or boot (a little less messy, 
IMHO). I'd also point out that he could collect dust particles from the air and 
plaster them against the wall, or even change the color of the air molecules 
themselves before plastering<i>them</i> against the wall. I consider all these 
variants of solution #1&#151;and that's only one solution! (Think how many 
there'd be if we counted them separately!)</p> 
<p></p>  ***** 
<p></p> 
<p><i>A thoughtful correspondent comes up with many of my answers.</i></p> 
<p>1) Time travel back in time before it was built/moved to that spot.</p> 
<p>2) Shrink down into the subatomic level and go thru the wall.</p> 
<p>3) Transmute the air inside into antimatter and explode the walls, while 
safe in a force field.</p> 
<p>4) Take off part of costume, put it on floor/wall, then hit it with 
something to break thru.</p> 
<p>5) Turn himself intangible, then walk thru the walls.</p> 
<p>6) Use the hard surface of the ring to scrape the yellow surface off the 
walls, then blast out.</p> 
<p>7) Go into another dimension (Qward?) and then move a few feet then come 
back outside the cell.</p> 
<p>8) Expand the molecule of the air in the cell and have it burst the cell 
open.</p> 
<p>9) Transmute the air into microblackhole and have it tunnel its way out, 
then shrink yourself down and go out the resulting hole.</p> 
<p>10) Open up a spacewarp to another place in the universe.</p> 
<p>Thats as many as I can come up with off the top of my head. What answers do 
you have?</p> 
<p>I'm withholding my answers, such as they are, until this thread matures a 
little (it<i>is</i> supposed to be a quiz, after all). But you got most of them 
and thought of one or two not on my list. Some comments:</p> 
<p>I'm not certain that GL can do either your 1) or 5), but that's part of the 
fun of this quiz, IMHO.</p> 
<p>I'm assuming this cell is made of a yellow material down to the molecular 
level (it's not just painted yellow), so I'm discounting your 6).</p> 
<p>I would argue that your 7) and 10) are variations on the same answer, since 
we don't know if a space warp proceeds through another dimension, hyper- or 
sub-space, or what.</p> 
<p>Your costume idea is similar to Lucio Perez's blood bath.</p> 
<p>I like your 3) and 9) especially. I hadn't crystallized my thinking on how 
GL could use a black hole yet.</p> 
<p>I'll give you credit for eight answers.</p>

<i>Someone suggests GL creates a miniature sun to 
superheat the air and explode the walls...a black hole to implode the 
walls...or dual black holes to form a wormhole through which he can escape.</i>
</p> 
<p>The expanding air theory I buy. Could GL suck in the walls of the prison 
without collapsing it upon himself, though? And the dual black-hole theory, 
while creative, seems like another variation of the space warp principle to me.

<p><i>Someone suggests GL creates a radio and calls for help.</i></p> 
<p>A radio! That's so simple I forgot to think of it! Of course, one could 
question whether GL can create matter out of thin air, but I can accept this as 
another valid answer.</p> 
<p></p>  ***** 
<p></p> 
<p><i>Someone objects that a green energy-imbued phantom couldn't pass through 
yellow walls.</i></p> 
<p>But does the green energy come in contact with the yellow walls/molecules, 
or go between them? Or does becoming a phantom mean removing oneself to another 
plane beyond our material one?</p> 
<p></p>  ***** 
<p></p> 
<p><i>Someone agrees GL can create a radio.</i></p> 
<p>I suspect you're right. GL has been depicted creating both green-energy and 
non-green-energy constructs (i.e., matter made out of one of the 105+ 
elements). I think it falls under &quot;the ring can do anything&quot; category.

<p></p>  ***** 
<p></p> 
<p><i>The meaning of &quot;yellow&quot; is questioned.</i></p> 
<p>&gt;&gt; My biggest question is are yellow things really yellow? In other 
words, our sun looks yellow to us because of the limited range of our vision. 
If a being with a much wider range of vision looked at it (or for safety's sake 
a picture of it &lt;g&gt;) it might see it as *&amp;%*&amp;% (whatever word it 
uses for ultraviolet). So what I'm really asking is, does the ring only not 
work on what the wearer PERCEIVES as yellow? Would a blind GL have any yellow 
problems? &lt;&lt;</p> 
<p></p>  ***** 
<p></p> 
<p>What is &quot;yellow,&quot; anyway?<br>
<i>Someone else responds to the 
previous correspondent.</i></p> 
<p>It depends on what you mean by &quot;yellow,&quot; I suppose, Phil.</p> 
<p>An object looks yellow either because it absorbs all other frequencies of 
visible light and reflects only the yellow frequencies, or because it radiates 
mostly in the yellow portion of the visible spectrum.</p> 
<p>Obviously, a creature unable to perceive light in the yellow portion of the 
spectrum would see such an object differently. If its perception were otherwise 
identical to our own, it would view the reflective object as black, just as we 
see an object that absorbs ALL visible light as being black. If its perception 
were otherwise WIDER than our own, it might well perceive the ultra-violet or 
infrared radiation the object reflects.</p> 
<p>I'm not as certain what would happen with the radiating object. Certainly, 
in the case of the being with wider perception, either UV or IR would come into 
play, but I'm not sure about the being with our perception minus the ability to 
see yellow. Since there would probably be some residual radiation in the rest 
of the visible spectrum, he might pick it up as one of the other colors, but 
more dimly than we see it, since yellow is the predominant frequency being 
radiated.</p> 
<p>If &quot;yellow&quot; means from the bearer's perspective, then 
yes&#151;those objects would not be &quot;yellow&quot; to those bearers. But if 
it means the scientifically quantifiable property of reflecting or radiating in 
the yellow portion of the electromagnetic spectrum, then the object is still 
&quot;yellow,&quot; no matter how the bearer perceives it.</p> 
<p></p>  ***** 
<p></p> 
<p><i>Someone suggests we overlooked the obvious. I'm not sure what the 
&quot;obvious&quot; was&#151;either that the cell would be dark, or that GL 
could close his eyes and not &quot;see&quot; the yellow, then do his standard 
tricks. The basic claim was that yellow is a function of perception.</i></p> 
<p>I think I said this cell has <i>luminescent</i> yellow walls, which means 
they supply their own yellow light without any outside interference or power 
source. So the room is lit &quot;normally,&quot; approximately the same as if 
it had a big yellow light bulb in it. If it were dark, your analysis would 
apply.</p> 
<p>Color is a phenomenon of perception and not matter? If a tree glows yellow 
in a forest and no one is there to see it, it isn't really yellow? Seems to me 
color has as much &quot;objective&quot; reality as any other property of 
matter, but I'll leave that question to the more physically- or 
philosophically-minded among us.</p> 
<p>The more interesting point you raise is: the yellow limit is based on GL's 
subconscious?!? So if he's not consciously aware of it, it effectively doesn't 
exist? If he's led unknowingly (e.g., blindfolded) to a yellow wall, he can 
punch right through it? That's a new one on me, so I'd love to hear what all 
you GL scholars out there think about it.</p> 
<p>Note to a previous respondent: Oops, I was wrong to suggest that GL's 
creating a radio was a valid way to escape. He's trapped in interstellar space, 
which means any radio signal would take several years to reach the nearest 
civilization. GL would be a corpse long before then. Nor do I accept that 
&quot;sub-space radio,&quot; as on Star Trek, exists in the GL continuity. But 
(hint) &quot;radio&quot; suggests other possible means of escape.</p> 
<p></p>  ***** 
<p></p> 
<p>Yellow limitation = subconscious?<br>
 The subconscious theory is 
interesting, but it would seem to change things. A person or an alien race that 
couldn't perceive yellow (e.g., someone color-blind) would have no weakness!</p>
<p>Comment (5/24/02): &nbsp;Actually, a GL story&#151;maybe one of the backup 
stories in FLASH&#151;established that the Guardians added a physical yellow 
impurity to the physical substance of which they made the rings. They did this 
intentionally to limit the Green Lanterns' power. Otherwise, the Lanterns might 
become too big for their britches. According to the canon, therefore, the 
yellow limitation was physical, not mental.</p> 
<p></p>  ***** 
<p></p> 
<p>&gt;&gt; GL's limited approach to eradicating evil doesn't show how limited 
*comic books* are. They demonstrate how limited an idea an omnipotent power 
ring is, or perhaps how limited some of GL's writers have been, but there's 
nothing about the limitations of a story idea which indicts the comic book 
medium. &lt;&lt;</p> 
<p>Okay, they show how limited the writers are, and also how limited comic 
books are in the<i>real world</i> of publishing. By that I mean that unless you 
mortgage yourself to put out your own comic book, you have to bow to the wishes 
of the publisher and the marketplace. And, as we all can probably imagine, a 
big-time publisher wouldn't be too happy with Superman or the Avengers fighting 
poverty or helping famine victims most of the time. Even though that's what 
superheroes would do in the &quot;real&quot; world, IMHO. In other words, I 
wasn't solely addressing comic books as an art form, but also as a commercial 
product.</p> 
<p></p>  ***** 
<p></p> 
<p><i>A response to &quot;If you were GL, would you sleep soundly?&quot;</i>
</p> 
<p>Knowing that I defended the weak, maintained order, and promoted good, I'd 
sleep the sleep of the just.</p> 
<p><i>&quot;If it were me, I'd be up nights thinking of ways I could eradicate 
evil, poverty, hunger, etc.&quot;</i></p> 
<p>Well, you seem to eschew the notion of free-will, thinking of sentient 
beings as meat robots that can be reprogrammed. You similiarly have very naive 
notions about the causes of poverty, hunger and injustice, and failed to 
consider the impact of any of your proposed changes.</p> 
<p><i>&quot;That GL has barely addressed these possibilities shows how limited 
comic books are, IMHO.&quot;</i></p> 
<p>Here's Hal Jordan, confronted with the reality of the universe, and the 
knowledge that a race of incredibly wise, utterly powerful, ancient immortals 
and millions, perhaps *billions* of members of the GLC haven't been able to do 
this. How should he be able to do what they couldn't?</p> 
<p>You really should consider renting a life, with an option to buy.</p> 
<p>Rob needs a life?<br>
 No need to get nasty, Allan. I thought we were all 
friends here. Where you get any idea about what I consider to be the causes of 
poverty, hunger, or injustice, or what I would do to address them, I don't 
know. Certainly you've gone way beyond the text of my messages.</p> 
<p>Seems to me there's been enough GL stories in recent years portraying the 
Guardians as shortsighted, biased, and just plain stupid that we can no longer 
consider them omniscient. That Hal Jordan has taken so long to open his eyes 
and see the Guardians' limitations, which Green Arrow and others saw in a 
flash, has been an ongoing theme for decades. You didn't miss any of those 
stories, did you?</p> 
<p>About the only story I can recall discussing the Guardians' attitude toward 
social causes is the one where GL stopped to clean up a pollution spill rather 
than rush off into outer space. The Guardian claimed that using the ring for 
one planet rather than for the entire universe was selfish. This<i>suggests</i> 
that the Guardians might oppose social tampering on a large scale, but the 
issue hasn't been addressed, to my knowledge.</p> 
<p>Since I've read the newspaper cover to cover for the last 25 years or so, 
plus numerous books and magazines, I'm willing to match my knowledge of current 
events to that of anyone on this forum. I'm extremely aware of the possible 
effects of such social tampering. If, for example, GL eradicated malaria with a 
power ring wish (which I believe he could do), more people would live, leading 
to increased overcrowding, hunger, resource depletion, etc. So? GL's dealing 
with the consequences of his actions, perhaps learning ultimately that he 
shouldn't have acted, would make a fine story&#151;an epic unmatched in comic 
book annals, IMHO.</p> 
<p>Comic books such as WATCHMEN, MIRACLEMAN, and SQAUDRON SUPREME have tried 
to deal with these issues. I've written my own comic book epic (unpublished, of 
course) that also deals with them. That no one who has edited or written GL 
(with the exception of rare individuals such as Denny O'Neil) has ever even 
considered these issues (in print) shows their naivete and shortsightedness, 
not mine.</p> 
<p>Comment (5/24/02): &nbsp;Since this posting will be available to 
generations of Hal &quot;Green Lantern&quot; Jordan fans, and since it 
addresses my beliefs about how juvenile most comics are, I consider it a worthy 
use of my time.</p> 
<p>In GL #76, Oliver Queen pointed out how blind and self-serving Hal Jordan 
was to ignore the world's problems and &quot;sleep soundly&quot; instead. His 
critique of the GL mentality remains spot-on. Indeed, every hero who ignores 
&quot;real-world&quot; problems is guilty of GL's moral lapses.</p> 
<p>In reality, a conscientious superhero would be like Samaritan in ASTRO 
CITY. He'd race from calamity to calamity 24 hours a day, with a bare minimum 
of time spent eating and sleeping and no &quot;down time&quot; or personal 
life. Kurt Busiek showed the folly of most superheroes with that creation, IMHO.
</p> 
<p></p>  ***** 
<p></p> 
<p><i>More on the nature of color.</i></p> 
<p>Okay, so color is both an objective and subjective phenomenon. I believe 
GL's ring is powerless against anything that is objectively yellow, regardless 
of his subjective perception of it. (In other words, if an object is emitting 
photons of a certain electromagnetic wavelength, his ring won't work against 
it.) What do you think?</p> 
<p></p>  ***** 
<p></p> 
<p>I have to assume that the Guardians established a certain span of 
electromagnetic wavelengths as the yellow weakness and that it applies equally 
to all GLs. But I don't know, of course. If the Guardians instead attuned each 
ring to each individual's perception of yellow, that's a whole other can of 
worms. In that case, two GLs whose rings didn't work against<i>what they 
perceived as</i> yellow could switch rings and both rings would work. It's an 
interesting idea and, unfortunately, something GL writers have never been brave 
or bold enough to address.</p> 
<p></p>  ***** 
<p></p> 
<p>Rob supplies the missing answers<br>
 And now...more GL quiz answers, to 
stir up your blood!</p> 
<p>1) Nobody mentioned one obvious trick, that GL could create a torch or emit 
pure heat and melt through the cell. If you agree GL can create matter out of 
nothing (which I don't, necessarily), he could similarly douse the walls with 
ring-created acid (or whatever chemicals the wall would react with). If you 
don't believe GL can create matter from nothing, you still might concede that 
he could draw enough atoms from the air and his body to create a viable 
chemical. (This all assumes the walls aren't made of inertron or something 
similar.)</p> 
<p>Likewise, GL could create a diamond drill (either from the carbon dioxide 
in the air or from nothing) and bore his way out. If you believe he can create 
something from nothing, he could create any number of machines to drill/dig/cut 
himself out, in fact.</p> 
<p></p>  ***** 
<p></p> 
<p>But wait, there's more!</p> 
<p>2) Just as the transporter on Star Trek does, GL could teleport himself 
outside the cell. This would involve him transmitting his atoms<i>through</i> 
the atoms of the walls. It would thus be different than either forming a space 
warp or turning himself into a phantom (though one could argue about the 
mechanics of phantomization, obviously).</p> 
<p></p>  ***** 
<p></p> 
<p>And more!</p> 
<p>3) GL could transmit radio waves, or any other wave of the electromagnetic 
spectrum that could pass through solid matter, but they wouldn't reach any 
civilization in time. He could, however, send a telepathic message to the 
nearest rescuer with translight capability and order him to come at translight 
speed. If you want to argue that the yellow walls would block telepathic waves, 
I submit that as far as we know, they're no different than radio waves (i.e., 
able to pass through solid matter). It's true, however, that GL might not have 
the will to send a telepathic message, even at &quot;the speed of 
thought,&quot; far enough or fast enough to reach a potential rescuer before 
his time was up. It's not the solution I would try first, therefore.</p> 
<p>4) I also suggest that GL could simply send a beam through the yellow 
wall&#151;either by converting the green energy to x-rays or some other 
wavelength of the electromagnetic spectrum, or by willing the beam to narrow 
itself to the thickness of a single particle/wave. Once outside, the beam could 
fulfill GL's request to find the nearest rescuer and bring him back pronto. Or, 
if you want to get really outlandish, the beam, once outside the cell, could 
form a space warp around the cell (without touching it) and deposit the cell 
somewhere else&#151;say, on Oa or in JLI headquarters.</p> 
<p></p>  ***** 
<p></p> 
<p>And yet more!</p> 
<p>5) Finally, I submit that GL could simply change the walls from yellow to 
some other color. How? By bombarding them with either energy or matter (perhaps 
high-velocity subatomic particles) from his ring. As in a cyclotron, the right 
combination of matter and energy would strike the walls and add or subtract 
protons or electrons until the wall transmuted into a different substance, one 
that was not yellow. GL could then use any other method to burst through that 
non-yellow portion of the wall.</p> 
<p>My conclusion? A GL is pretty much omnipotent, even against the color 
yellow. The next time you see a GL battling a Daxamite, Mongul, or Darkseid, 
ask yourself: Why doesn't GL just zip a tiny black hole into his brain, or push 
him through a space warp, or turn him into a phantom, or send him back through 
time? And next time you see GL square off against someone like Goldface, you 
can laugh yourselves silly. Let's see: How many ways can GL defeat a person in 
a yellow costume...?</p> 
<p>Comment (6/5/02): &nbsp;Something is yellow because it absorbs light of 
every wavelength except the yellow wavelength. GL could defeat a yellow villain 
by filtering the sunlight before it struck the villain. That would change the 
villain to another color, perhaps green, and then GL could ring him.</p>

<p></p> 
<p>Correspondent thinks GL stories didn't happen<br>
<i>&quot;...there's been 
enough GL stories in recent years portraying the Guardians as shortsighted, 
biased, and just plain stupid that we can no longer consider them 
omniscient.&quot;</i></p> 
<p>And every one of those stories&#151;including the so-called classic GL/GA 
stories in, IMO, dead wrong. As dead wrong as any story that portrays Superman 
as less than a Boy Scout. As dead wrong as any story that portrays Batman as 
carrying a gun.</p> 
<p>The point is, Robert, that a lot of us really OLD Green Lantern fans do not 
accept the idea that the Guardians are a bunch of shortsighted and 
mean-spirited busybodies.</p> 
<p>And, while the story ideas you cite are good ones, once they've been done, 
then what? Where would GL go from there? Sounds like a recipe for creating a 
character who, having been defeated on the big issues, sees little use in 
fighting the small ones.</p> 
<p>Where would GL go after fighting my prospective storyline? Depends on the 
conclusion: whether it was positive or negative, whether political bodies such 
as the UN or other superpowered groups (e.g., the JLI or even L.E.G.I.O.N. or 
the Darkstars) got involved, etc. Where does GL go<i>now</i> after a fight? He 
flies airplanes/sells toys/sells insurance, saves the universe from exploding, 
then goes back to flying/selling as if he hasn't had the slightest shred of 
emotion or thought about anything. If I wanted to read cardboard, I'd stick to 
my Cheerios box.</p> 
<p>Comment (5/24/02): &nbsp;The only thing dead wrong here, friend, is your 
insistence that we should regard only the most simpleminded GL stories as 
canonical. I suggest you stick to Archie or Disney or DC's ADVENTURES series if 
you want stories that are figuratively black and white.</p> 
<p>If anything, we should write the simple-Simon (and Kirby) stories of the 
'40s, '50s, and '60s out of the canon. In fact, that's what we've (partly) done.

<p>&gt;&gt; Teleportation would require alteration of his molecules in some 
way by the green energy of the ring, probably investing them with some of it. 
Since the green energy can't pass through the yellow walls, I'd doubt his 
energy-imbued/altered molecules could, either. &lt;&lt;</p> 
<p>I imagine he could construct a transporter-type mechanism in the middle of 
the cell, then use it to &quot;beam&quot; his unirradiated molecules just like 
any other object in a teleporation machine. But I do believe that yellow is an 
attribute of the wall's molecules, not the space between the molecules, which 
makes them permeable to green energy (if a ring-wielder is smart enough).</p> 
<p></p>  ***** 
<p></p> 
<p>Critic tries to poke holes in solutions<br>
</p> 
<p>#3 assumes telepathy works at translight speeds and at interstellar 
distances. There is no evidence of that, I believe, in the DC Universe as 
currently constructed.</p> 
<p>#4 assumes that either a) the beam can change its own nature or b) that the 
material of the walls of the cell is not so dense as to prevent even a 
particle-sized beam from penetrating it. &lt;&lt;</p> 
<p>#5 also assumes that a substance that is transformed into another substance 
by green energy is not somehow still imbued with the green energy. I recall 
instances in which GL could not do almost exactly what you propose&#151;because 
the green energy would cease to have effect once the object hit the yellow wall.
</p> 
<p>As for why GL doesn't do any of the things you suggest:</p> 
<p>Well, putting a black hole through someone's brain will probably kill them. 
Most GLs have not been depicted as murderers. And, in the heat of battle, how 
likely are YOU to remember all these nifty ideas? If somebody's coming at me 
with a sledgehammer, chances are my first instinct is to protect myself from 
the hammer, not think of ways to send my opponent to the other side of the 
universe.</p> 
<p>Yes, well, most of these solutions assume something. If the walls are made 
of something stronger and more dense than GL's will, many of the solutions will 
fail (that's why it's good to have backups!).</p> 
<p>I believe GL has received telepathic transmissions from Oa and across 
interstellar space. Presumably they were happening in real-time since the 
crisis hadn't been over for a hundred or thousand years by the time GL arrived.
</p> 
<p>GL has changed his green energy to heat, magnetism, x-rays, kryptonite 
radiation, and so forth, so I'm not sure what you mean by the beam's 
&quot;changing its own nature.&quot;</p> 
<p>The cyclotronic concept presupposes only that GL can create such a device 
and use it to shoot normal, nonirradiated molecules (from the air, etc.) at the 
wall. If you're saying that anything GL's energy creates or touches is imbued 
with the green energy during the contact...or<i>after</i> the contact...I don't 
think so.</p> 
<p>Okay, how about a black hole in the foot to cripple someone like Mongul 
when he's about to squish your brains? I think that would fall within the GL 
rules. And if I were GL, I would practice regularly against super-demons and 
attack squads in yellow uniforms, maybe in some sort of &quot;danger 
room&quot;&#151;naw, that's a silly idea.</p> 
<p>Comment (5/24/02): &nbsp;If someone's coming at you with a sledgehammer, <i>
you</i> go ahead and hit him with a power-ringed boxing glove. I hope that's 
enough to keep him from caving in your skull. Meanwhile, I'll teleport him to a 
jail or, better yet, excise his sledgehammering thoughts instantly and make him 
a productive member of society. You and Hal Jordan may not have the will to do 
these things, but I do.</p> 
<p>I gave several solutions besides putting a black hole through someone's 
brain. The other solutions were nonlethal, which is probably why you didn't 
address them. Apparently you didn't get my general point: that GL can do 
anything a writer says he can.</p> 
<p></p>  ***** 
<p></p> 
<p><i>Again someone questions the contest's purpose. My response:</i></p> 
<p>It seems like a good thing to explore. I'm not of the school that says we 
should accept these little miracles and coincidences just because they 
originated in the Golden or Silver Age. A good explanation or elaboration can 
make an old story point richer without invalidating it.</p> 
<p></p>  ***** 
<p></p> 
<p>More on telepathy<br>
 &gt;&gt; In one Flash/Green Lantern story they had 
someone make some duplicates of Hal, who then attacked him. All of the Hal's 
got arrested and taken to the police building where Barry Allen worked. He 
walked in and saw them and then got a telepathic message from the real Hal. 
(But he could only tell which one had sent the message by the fact that the 
real Hal's ring glowed while he sent it. Thats the only time I can recall Hal 
using telepathy. &lt;&lt;</p> 
<p>Aren't most of the messages from the Guardians telepathic? The dialogs in 
outer space? I'm no GL scholar, but I can point to GL #67 off the top of my 
head, in which a criminal usurped the ring's power to order people to commit 
crimes. That would have to be telepathic unless he rewired their brain 
chemistry, which seems unlikely.</p> 
<p>Comment (5/24/02): &nbsp;In either case, the story proves my point. If a 
ring-wielder can order someone to commit crimes, he can order someone<i>not</i> 
to commit crimes. He doesn't have to know the definition of &quot;evil&quot; to 
do so. He doesn't have to know why people commit crimes on a philosophical or 
biological level. He can order the ring to scan and digest the country's laws, 
then &quot;order&quot; people not to break those laws. Again, end of story.</p> 
<p>Not only can he stop people from committing crimes by filling their heads 
with an inviolable command to obey the law, he can prevent any crime at the 
source. Bank robbery? He transmits an impregnable green-energy vault to every 
bank in the world. Wife-beating? He gives every woman a personal energy shield 
she can activate at will. Plane-jacking? He has the airlines retrofit their 
jets with a panic signal his ring monitors constantly. Etc.</p> 
<p>For any crime, you could come up with a dozen proactive solutions that 
would prevent it from ever occurring again. Really, individual solutions aren't 
even necessary. GL simply could order his ring to monitor every activity in the 
entire world simultaneously. If someone robbed a bank, struck a woman, or 
hijacked a plane, he'd order the ring to respond. The ring would freeze the 
criminal in place and summon the authorities&#151;without GL's knowing anything 
about human philosophy or biochemistry. End of crime worldwide, permanently.</p>
<p>Instead, your typical GL responds to crimes after the fact. Your typical GL 
is stupid. Fearless, perhaps, but a blithering idiot when it comes to creative 
thinking.</p> 
<p>Saying GL has to know how &quot;evil&quot; works is a complete dodge of the 
real issue. Namely, that GL as written is either immoral or incompetent because 
he doesn't use his power wisely. The same could be said of his writers, 
editors, and publishers.</p> 
<p></p>  ***** 
<p></p> 
<p><i>A silly comment.</i></p> 
<p>&gt;&gt; Ha! You claim to be well informed, but you are not! You think GL 
could eradicate malaria? Never! It's *yellow* fever! &lt;&lt;</p> 
<p>Yes, and GL probably couldn't cure jaundice or anything else that turns the 
skin yellowish. Or &quot;gold fever&quot; or &quot;yellow journalism,&quot; 
either.</p> 
<p></p>  ***** 
<p></p> 
<p><i>Someone concedes my point.</i></p> 
<p>&gt;&gt; The Power Ring and Lantern is limitless power. &lt;&lt;</p> 
<p>If that were true, then the Guardians would simply use that limitless power 
to accomplish whatever ultimate purpose they had in mind, without use of a 
&quot;corps.&quot;</p> 
<p>Comment (5/24/02): &nbsp;GL's power is limitless when it serves the story, 
limited otherwise. If he needs the energy to keep a planet from blowing up, 
he's got it. If he needs the energy to knock out Solomon Grundy, and the story 
still has a ways to go, he doesn't have it.</p> 
<p>In short, the concept of GL's ring is tragically flawed. It needs a 
definition and limitations to even begin to work, story-wise. The lack of 
definition is a big reason why GL has never succeeded as a character. And why 
most adults don't read comics.</p> 
<p></p>  ***** 
<p></p> 
<p><i>Someone makes a good point.</i></p> 
<p>Good point! Why didn't those goofy Guardians simply will the universe's 
problems out of existence, rather than create a Corps, etc.?</p> 
<p>The contest, 2002 version<br>
 In Spring 2002, I wrote to Captain Comics 
(Andrew Smith) and suggested he run the Green Lantern contest as part of his 
column in Comic Buyer's Guide. He did. Some additional thoughts on Green 
Lantern and his ring:</p> 
<p>Comment (7/2/02): &nbsp;DC's powers-that-be may have offered explanations 
for how Green Lantern's ring works, but all such explanations are suspect. 
Consider:</p> </li> 
<li>GL has to know the &quot;principles&quot; of the things he creates or 
does. This is clearly false. Take the most basic GL operations: making himself 
lighter than air...creating force shields...generating life-support in outer 
space...creating constructs such as blowtorches or monkeys. Although a few 
people could construct a blowtorch from scratch, I doubt many of them could 
construct a monkey. Our most advanced biochemists barely understand how to 
clone an egg cell; they haven't a clue how to construct a working adult animal.
</li> 
<p>And the other tasks are simply beyond human knowledge. Neither Hal Jordan 
nor any other human knows how to do these things. At best Hal is doing what 
Kyle supposedly does: visualizing the result and letting the ring figure out 
how to do it.</p> 
<li>GL can do anything he can visualize. This is again clearly false. Think of 
a GL doing something like keeping a planet from blowing up. What exactly is he 
visualizing? A planetary explosion must involve a near-infinite number of 
physical and chemical processes. A human can't even comprehend these processes, 
much less visualize solutions to them.</li> 
<p>If the answer is he's visualizing the planet as a whole, not as a gazillion 
components...well, that applies to creating objects like motorcycles and 
blowtorches too. If he doesn't have to know how a planet &quot;works&quot; to 
keep it from blowing up, he doesn't have to know how a motorcycle works to 
create one. At best Kyle is imagining (not visualizing) a result and letting 
the ring figure out how to do it.</p> 
<p>We're back to where we started. The ring can do anything the wearer (and 
writer) imagines. If DC wants to stick with the visualization claim...well, 
Green Che Guevara and I can visualize food and medicine appearing before each 
of the world's six billion people. We can visualize ourselves shrinking, 
teleporting across the galaxy, or traveling through time. So let's see it 
happen.</p> 
<p>A more limited explanation for how the ring works would make GL a more 
plausible character, but I haven't heard a workable explanation. Any such 
explanation will have unintended consequences&#151;eliminating stunts we've 
seen GL do thousands of times. That's okay by me, but I doubt DC will let 
itself be bound by the hobgoblin of consistency.</p>
