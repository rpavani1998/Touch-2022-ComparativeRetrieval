 &quot;I recieved the belt 
buckle here in CT within 2 days. The belt buckle was even BETTER than the way 
it looked in the ad ! I also called 2bhip customer service line with a question 
and spoke with a very friendly girl who answered all my questions. I wish I had 
such a store to deal with here in CT. 2bhip is #1 in my book and they have me 
as a customer for LIFE!&quot;- Eric Steiner <br>
 Though synonymous with belt 
buckles, cowboys historically used suspenders instead of belts. Western belt 
buckles actually came into use and grew in popularity when the Western film 
movement first depicted cowboys with the huge, shiny, take-no-prisoners belt 
buckles that we now associate directly with the old West. <br>

<br>
 A classic 
Jekyll and Hyde story, the Hulk is the alter-ego of the scientist Bruce Banner. 
When Bruce experiences extreme stress, he becomes the Hulk, a green walking 
tank of a beast that will smash through anyone and anything until it's anger is 
satiated. It's a raw and aggressive series, where the madder Hulk gets, the 
stronger Hulk gets. Symbolic of runaway emotion, his indiscriminate rampages 
are a perfect example of the anti-hero concept that Marvel offers. Show off 
your fierce inner beast withIncredible Hulk belt buckles , and check out the 
rest of ourMarvel Comics belt buckles . <br>
