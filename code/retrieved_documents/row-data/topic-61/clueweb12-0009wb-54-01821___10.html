 &quot;He was perched with one knee drawn up, chin resting on his 
arms.&nbsp; He looked totally relaxed...and I suddenly realized this was how 
Superman would sit.&nbsp; He wouldn't puff out his chest or posture heroically, 
he would be totally chilled.&nbsp; If nothing can hurt you, you can afford to 
be cool.&nbsp; A man like Superman would never have to tense against the cold; 
never have to flinch in the face of a blow.&nbsp; He would be completely laid 
back, un-tense.&nbsp; With this image of Superman relaxing on a cloud looking 
out for us all in my head, I rushed back to my hotel room and filled dozens of 
pages of my notebook with notes and drawings.&quot;

<i>  All-Star: The concept behind All-Stars is to get the hottest, 
fan-friendliest writers and artists to do their interpretations of classic DC 
characters in their classic scenarios, free of the restraints of current 
post-Crisis continuities.&nbsp; If you haven't read DC books in years, you'll 
immediately feel comfortable with All-Star books.&nbsp; At the same time, these 
books will look and feel like 2005 publications.</i> <br>

 All-Star is not about continuity&mdash;it's about about 
telling new stories for a very different audience we've got now because they're 
reading manga and adults are looking at superhero movies.
<p> Frank and I are keeping modern sensibilities in mind while trying to make 
sure that each of our stories addresses some basic human fear or need in a big, 
colorful, comic book way.&nbsp; We hope to produce a collection of science 
fiction folk tales with Superman at the heart of them.&nbsp; I like to think of 
these stories as 'relevant' to the human condition although not necessarily 
relevant to the current headlines, if you see what I mean.&nbsp; The All-Star 
Superman is intended to appeal to a wide audience of diverse people for a long 
time, like the Greek myths.</p> 
<p> We're using the leeway the All-Star concept gives us to take the best 
elements from every era of Superman and use them to build a whole new world and 
direction for the character.&nbsp; I'm certainly looking at this as my 
definitive statement.&nbsp; After Superman, I have no mainstream comics work 
lined up.</p> 
<p> Dan wanted this to be 'Original' Superman, 'Classic' Superman 
basically&mdash;more like a movie or the animated version where the set-ups are 
the familiar ones most people know&mdash;i.e. Lois doesn't realize Clark is 
Superman, Jimmy Olsen is a cub reporter etc.&nbsp; Back in 1999, however, one 
of the lynchpins of mySuperman 2000 pitch was to make the married Superman 
scenario work as well as the previous Lois/Clark/Superman triangle had.&nbsp;
Mark Waid and I argued over this at length, believe me, with Waid&mdash;that 
arch iconcoclast&mdash;coming down, for a change, on the side of 
tradition.&nbsp; With<i>All-Star Superman</i>, I think I've come up with a 
whole new approach to the Lois, Clark and Superman too relationship, so I'll 
leave it at that until you see how it plays out in the books.</p> 
<p> We deal with the entire origin sequence using four panels on page one of 
our first issue, in a way I think fans will find amusing.&nbsp; My only rule 
with Superman is that he<i>does not kill.</i>&nbsp; That's the essential 
core.&nbsp; He always finds a way to solve every single problem without anyone 
being hurt.</p> 
<p> There are a few little bits and pieces left over from the aborted Superman 
2000 pitch which I came up with but this is something new and most of this 
material was put together over the last two years.&nbsp; My comics tend to be 
inspired by whatever's going on in my life and in the world at the time and 
Superman is no exception.</p> 
<p> Comic books have changed and my ideas are constantly evolving and changing 
with the times.&nbsp; The best Superman idea I ever had, I gave to Mark Millar 
for the conclusion ofRed Son, so I've been forced to try even harder to do 
something even better here.</p> 
<p> The first issue &quot;Faster...&quot; starts with Superman attempting to 
rescue the first manned spaced mission to the sun.&nbsp; Some astronauts have 
tried to land, so he has to go rescue them.&nbsp; His solar cells become super 
charged by an overdose of solar radiation.&nbsp; They're designed to absorb 
solar radiation, but this time, because of the amount and the proximity, he's 
overdone it.&nbsp; There is a fatal chain reaction in his cell structure and 
his cells begin to self-destruct.&nbsp; He finds out he has a year to live. 
P.R.O.J.E.C.T. specialists race to create a new Superman.</p> 
<p>The whole thing starts with Superman: &quot;Okay, what do I do 
now&quot;?&nbsp; It's a big science fiction story about Superman's death and 
what he'd do if he thought he was dying.&nbsp; It's also Luthor's biggest 
scheme&mdash;he's in prison in the first issue, and that's exactly where he 
wants to be.&nbsp; It's all worked out, there are lots of twists and turns.</p> 
<p>The first issue ends with Superman revealing his identity to Lois and the 
second one has this take on the Lois and Clark relationship that no one has 
ever done before.</p> 
<p> Issue #2 is the 'Lois-Lane-in-the-Fortress' issue of <em>All-Star</em>
.&nbsp; It's the Lois we all love&mdash;shrewd, witty, romantic, tough...and 
obsessively trying to crack the secrets of Superman's civilian identity.&nbsp; 
The Fortress is stuffed with a ton of new toys and gets haunted by the bandaged 
ghost of the Unknown Superman of 4500&nbsp;AD.&nbsp; The Kandorians finally get 
out of that bottle.&nbsp; Superman gets a new power.&nbsp;</p>
<p> Issue #3 is 'Lois Lane--Superwoman!' so dig it.&nbsp; Lois is a complex 
and fascinating character, that's all I'll say until the book comes out.</p>
<p> Clark Kent winds up sharing a prison cell with Lex Luthor in issue 
#5.&nbsp; The Bizarro Cube Earth invades our world in an epic 2-part adventure 
(no 'decompression' here!) and we're recasting the Bizarros as a frightening, 
unstoppable zombie-plague style menace.&nbsp; The Bizarros are a lot more 
predatory in<em>All-Star</em> and their touch is infectious.&nbsp; It's a 
'zombie apocalypse' approach to the Bizarro concept and the idea of an 
unstopable plague of backwards-talking idiocy sweeping across the globe seems 
ironically amusing right now.&nbsp; Bizarro Jor-El and the Bizarro JLA turn up 
in the second part of that story too.&nbsp; What else?&nbsp; We meet Earth's 
replacement Superman and Clark Kent takes on a new superhero identity... Ten of 
the 12 issues are complete short stories in 22 pages, so lots of stuff 
happens.&nbsp; And it all links together as a maxi-arc or whatever they call 
them these days, entitled 'The 12 Labors of Superman'.</p>
<p> In <em>All-Star</em>, Superman doesn't talk much.&nbsp; He just shows up 
and saves the day and then leaves.&nbsp; He's more like the early Superman in 
that sense.&nbsp; He saves the day and doesn't give speeches on what's right 
and wrong.&nbsp; To me, he's a big folk hero.&nbsp; He's been around 
forever.&nbsp; He's like Paul Bunyan or Johnny Appleseed and here I'm allowed 
to tell new stories of these amazing folk heroes.&nbsp; You've got to make 
Superman about a few things.&nbsp; It's got to be about big emotions and big 
human feelings like death and loss and bereavement and grief and joy.&nbsp; 
Then you weave those weird sci-fi stories around those themes.&nbsp; I think 
those are the best Superman stories&mdash;the ones about human feelings but on 
a huge, cosmic, ridiculous, superhero canvas.</p>
<p></p>
<p> We're changing his costume slightly...the symbol slightly.&nbsp; And for a 
small part of it, he won't have those red trunks on.&nbsp; I mean, we all want 
to see it.&nbsp; We all want to know, &quot;Would he look really cool without 
the trunks?&quot;</p>
<p> </p>  No one has ever done Clark Kent to Superman; showing the difference 
between these two guys. And Frank can do it. He can do the body language in a 
way you've never seen it. You'll actually see his whole posture change and his 
paunch disappear and his three chins disappear.&nbsp; This is a complete 
transformation.&nbsp; This is like Jekyll and Hyde. We've never seen it before 
in 70 years of Superman.
<p></p>
<p> Ma &amp; Pa Kent&mdash;one dead.&nbsp; We're going with the version where 
Pa Kent has died.&nbsp; That's the day Superboy becomes a man.</p>
<p> We've got a very different version of Lois.&nbsp; This is a Lois who's 
been through a lot.&nbsp; Superman's been lying to her for years.&nbsp; When 
she gets the real story in the first issue, she doesn't necessarily believe 
what he tells her.&nbsp; It's clearly a different dynamic.&nbsp; Lois and Clark 
are kind of seen as Katherine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy.&nbsp; Lois likes Clark 
because he's smart and witty.&nbsp; Even though he's a big farm boy, he knows 
things; she can talk to him. There are really two Clark Kents.&nbsp; There's 
Clark on the farm and then Clark acting in Metropolis.&nbsp; The Clark I like 
is middle-America values and he applies those to morality.&nbsp; There's the 
new Clark Kent; he's interesting.&nbsp; He's the one I like.&nbsp; The bumbling 
Clark Kent is Superman acting.&nbsp; Every time he knocks something over he's 
doing it to save somebody.</p> 
<p> Superman's pal has to be the coolest guy on Earth.&nbsp; We're doing Olsen 
as the guy every teenage boy wants to be&mdash;smart, fearless, funny, a big 
hit with the girls, a good loser, a great fighter, an action correspondent on 
the sexiest newspaper in town and best friend of Superman!</p>
<p> Luthor is the part of us that's the most evil, the most human, and the 
most brilliant.&nbsp; He's never managed to get rid of Superman because deep 
down he knows that when he does, he'll be forced to prove himself to the 
world...and be found wanting.&nbsp; This is the subconscious engine that drives 
his hatred of his nemesis.</p>
<p> The rest of Superman's Rogues Gallery is pretty weak, so I've tried to add 
some characters I think might enhance the mix.&nbsp; Solaris, the Tyrant Sun 
from the<i>DC 1 Million</i> series gets a makeover and a return visit, and I 
figured Superman could use a 'Subhuman' counterpart, so I've created Krull, an 
evolved dinosaur dictator who rules a monstrous civilization at the center of 
the earth.&nbsp; He's only in the story for a few pages but the concept is 
strong and feels like one that could be used again.&nbsp; Then there's the 
Abominable Snowman, a tragic scientist who's a bit like a refrigerated 
Incredible Hulk and turns up for a couple of pages.&nbsp; Superman needs some 
good tough monsters to fight, so I've tried to think along those lines.&nbsp; 
In most cases, the villains only get walk-on roles in this one, however.&nbsp; 
Overall, the series is more about Superman's relationships with his friends and 
with the world than anything else.</p> 
<p> People know my stuff and I'm sure they can guess what to expect.&nbsp; 
It's going to be big, bold sci-fi Superman for 12 issues.</p>
