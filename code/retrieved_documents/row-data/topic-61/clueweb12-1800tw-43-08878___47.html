<p>Earlier this year, beneath the wind-whipped tarpaulin of a catering tent in 
Gloucester, I was working on a film with the actor Malcolm Sinclair. Over 
scrambled eggs at an ungodly hour, he told me something I had not previously 
known: when Christopher Reeve was young, barely out of Juilliard, he was 
roundly mocked by his peers on Broadway for accepting the role of Superman. It 
was considered an ignoble thing for a classical actor to do.</p>

<li>Avengers Assemble</li> 
<li><b>Production year:</b> 2012</li> 
<li><b>Country:</b> USA</li> 
<li><b>Cert (UK):</b> 12A</li> 
<li><b>Runtime:</b> 142 mins</li> 
<li><b>Directors:</b> Joss Whedon</li> 
<li><b>Cast:</b> Chris Evans, Chris Hemsworth, Cobie Smulders, Gwyneth 
Paltrow, Jeremy Renner, Mark Ruffalo, Robert Downey Jr., Samuel L Jackson, 
Scarlett Johansson, Stellan Skarsgard, Tom Hiddleston</li> 
<li>More on this film</li> </ol> 
<p>I grew up watching Superman. As a child, when I first learned to dive into 
a swimming pool, I wasn't diving, I was flying, like Superman. I used to dream 
of rescuing a girl I had a crush on (my Lois Lane) from a playground bully 
(General Zod). Reeve, to my mind, was&nbsp;the first real superhero.</p> 
<p>Since then some of the greatest actors have turned superheroes into a 
serious business: Michael Keaton andJack Nicholson in Batman; Ian McKellen and 
Patrick Stewart, the first venerable knights of the X-Men, who have now passed 
the baton to Michael Fassbender and James McAvoy. In spite of 20 years of 
mercurial work in the likes of Chaplin and Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, it was his 
rock-star-charismatic yet somehow humble Tony Stark in Iron Man that helped 
wider audiences finally embrace the enormous talent ofRobert Downey Jr. And 
Heath Ledger's performance in The Dark Knight quite simply changed the game. He 
raised the bar not just for actors in superhero films, but young actors 
everywhere; for me. His performance was dark, anarchic, dizzying, free, and 
totally, thrillingly, dangerous.</p>  Tom Hiddleston as Loki in Avengers

<p>Actors in any capacity, artists of any stripe, are inspired by their 
curiosity, by their desire to explore all quarters of life, in light and in 
dark, and reflect what they find in their work. Artists instinctively want to 
reflect humanity, their own and each other's, in all its intermittent virtue 
and vitality, frailty and fallibility.</p> 
<p>I have never been more inspired than when I watched Harold Pinter speak in 
a direct address to camera in his Nobel lecture in 2005. &quot;Truth in drama 
is forever elusive. You never quite find it but the search for it is 
compulsive. The search is clearly what drives the endeavour. The search is your 
task. More often than not you stumble upon the truth in the dark, colliding 
with it or just glimpsing an image or a shape which seems to correspond with 
the truth, often without realising that you have done so. But the real truth is 
that there never is any such thing as one truth to be found in dramatic art. 
There are many. These truths challenge each other, recoil from each other, 
reflect each other, ignore each other, tease each other, are blind to each 
other. Some times you feel you have the truth of a moment in your hand, then it 
slips through your fingers and is lost.&quot;</p> 
<p>Big talk for someone in a silly superhero film, I hear you say. But 
superhero films offer a shared, faithless, modern mythology, through which 
these truths can be explored. In our increasingly secular society, with so many 
disparate gods and different faiths, superhero films present a unique canvas 
upon which our shared hopes, dreams and apocalyptic nightmares can be projected 
and played out. Ancient societies had anthropomorphic gods: a huge pantheon 
expanding into centuries of dynastic drama; fathers and sons, martyred heroes, 
star-crossed lovers, the deaths of kings &ndash; stories that taught us of the 
danger of hubris and the primacy of humility. It's the everyday stuff of every 
man's life, and we love it. It sounds cliched, but superheroes can be lonely, 
vain, arrogant and proud. Often they overcome these human frailties for the 
greater good. The possibility of redemption is right around the corner, but we 
have to earn it.</p> 
<p>The Hulk is the perfect metaphor for our fear of anger; its destructive 
consequences, its consuming fire. There's not a soul on this earth who hasn't 
wanted to &quot;Hulk smash&quot; something in their lives. And when the heat of 
rage cools, all that we are left with is shame and regret. Bruce Banner, the 
Hulk's humble alter ego, is as appalled by his anger as we are. That other 
superhero Bruce &ndash; Wayne &ndash; is the superhero-Hamlet: a brooding soul, 
misunderstood, alone, for ever condemned to avenge the unjust murder of his 
parents. Captain America is a poster boy for martial heroism in military 
combat: the natural leader, the war hero. Spider-Man is the eternal adolescent 
&ndash; Peter Parker's arachnid counterpart is an embodiment of his best-kept 
secret &ndash; his independent thought and power.</p> 
<p>Superhero movies also represent the pinnacle of cinema as &quot;motion 
picture&quot;. I'd like to think that the Lumi&egrave;re brothers would thrill 
at the cat-and-mouse chase through the netherworld streets of Gotham in The 
Dark Knight, with helicopters tripping on high-tensile wires and falling from 
the sky, and a huge Joker-driven triple-length truck upending 180 degrees like 
a Russian acrobat. I hope that they would cheer and delight at the 
rollercoaster ride through the skies of Manhattan at the end ofAvengers Assemble
. These scenes are the result of a creative engine set in motion when the 
Lumi&egrave;res shotL'Arriv&eacute;e d'un Train en Gare de la Ciotat in 1895. 
The trains just move a lot faster these days.&nbsp;And not just trains; trucks, 
bikes, bat-mobiles and men in flying, shining iron suits. The spectacle is part 
of the fun &ndash; part of the art, part of our shared joy.</p> 
<p>How far I hope we have come since the judgment of Christopher Reeve's 
peers. Maybe playing superheroes isn't such an ignoble undertaking after all. 
&quot;I still believe in heroes,&quot; says Samuel L Jackson's Nick Fury in 
Avengers Assemble. So do I, sir. So do I.</p> 
<p>&bull;&nbsp;Avengers Assemble is released in the UK on 26 April.</p>

<p>I don't think the Lumerie brothers would marvel at comic book films. Film 
for them was about capturing and documenting the world. Not this.</p> 
<p>Otherwise a good article, I hope the Avengers movie is actually good.</p>

<p>I reckon the Lumi&egrave;re brothers would be pretty darn astonished by 
superhero films. Film isn't about capturing the reality of the world, it's 
about capturing the truth of it.</p> </li>

<p>there's huge goodwill among the fans for these characters, devotion even, 
nay love - it's great that the films have been cast so well, and that everyone 
involved has understood that at some level 'it matters', and like Tom given 
their all. It could all have turned out so much for the worse, instead....looks 
like The Avengers (assemble whatever ) will be rather excellent</p> </li>

<p>I can remember going to the theatre with my dad and seeing Superman, then 
Superman II. I was 8, then 10. I thought he was amazing and I BELIEVED. I 
believed that there could be someone so good, honest, true, with ethics and a 
depth of feeling for his fellow man that was impermeable. It has stuck with me 
all my life, and into my own career as a social service worker. Call it trite, 
call it sentimental, but it is the truth.</p> 
<p>While I do think that superheroes and supervillains are best portrayed by 
classically trained actors, Reeve was something else beyond this, someone who 
truly believed in the calling - and indeed in his own life, became a real 
superhero in the fight for his health and for the health of others with spinal 
injuries.</p> 
<p>Other than Heath Ledger and maybe Robert Downey, Jr. and possibly James 
McAvoy, I don't think anyone has come quite close enough yet to what he 
achieved in portrayal of superheroes/supervillains. However, Tom, I believe, 
has taken on board what we both felt watching Reeve and in doing so, has 
created a supervillain with solidity and depth. I look forward to Avengers 
(Assemble) in the hopes that Joss Whedon will do wonders with it.</p> 
<p>One can only hope, and Reeve's precedent demands it.</p> </li>

<p>I am in such awe of the incredible, imaginative vulnerability of the 
Superhero sub-genre. I truly think it represents the best and worst of each of 
us...in an amplified state. I believe that's why so many of us are drawn 
towards Superman, Captain America, Thor...and even those considered the 
villains in our divisional mindset of 'Good vs Evil' - brilliant characters 
such as Loki, Doc Ock, Lex, etc...</p> 
<p>From the comics and books to the silver screen, I think we are so fortunate 
to have such incredible characters come to life - who all, really, come from 
many shades of grey who have chosen their paths shaped by their interactions in 
life. When they fly, they soar. When they fall, they fall so incredibly far.</p>
<p>I realize that they are fictional; however, in reality, aren't we doing the 
exact same thing? Though, not in leather and metal, spandex and cloaks...mind 
you, but...these stories, movies, characters and ideas really allow us to think 
and embrace ourselves as who we are...super. Stan, Jack, Joe, etc: they were 
onto something...marvelous.</p> 
<p>Wonderful article, Tom. Thank you for your insight and passion.</p>

<p>Nah. Superman, Spiderman, Batman, and all the other caped and masked 
crusaders, are a bunch of one-dimensional vigilante wankmag material for 
adolescent American teenage males.</p> 
<p>America produced Captain America, without hint of irony. Britain produced 
Judge Dredd, with nothing except irony. America gave us Superman, supporting 
the state at all costs. Britain gave us V for Vendetta, destroying the state at 
all costs. America gave us Batman, the billionaire scientist Olympian who 
spends his time hitting muggers. Britain gave us the Watchmen, where the masked 
crusaders were a gang of hooligans and hypocrites. America gave us Spiderman, 
where getting bitten by a spider stops you getting bullied at school. Britain 
gave us the Invisibles, which handily informs us strong drugs and kinky sex are 
pretty much peak human experiences.</p> 
<p>I love big action movies me. But give me a Robocop, laden with irony and an 
aggressive subtext ,over an Iron Man, laden with nothing except the egos 
involved in the production.</p> </li>

<p>In a previous thread I just saw you proclaim the superiority of the UK to 
the US because you had a female prime minister before the US had a black 
president.</p> 
<p>Now in this thread you once again feel the need to proclaim the superiority 
of British comic book characters to the US version.</p> 
<p>You clearly suffer from an inferiority complex to the US and need to make 
up for it by highlighting minor differences that make you feel better. You know 
I'm right.</p> 
<p>Tell you what. You also have better tea. Now run along with the rest of the 
2nd tier.</p> </li>

<p>Well put, sir.</p> 
<p>Heroes are fascinating. The possibility that there can be individuals who 
epitomize such polar extremes of character &ndash; virtues such as courage, 
honor, love even, as well as the incredibly illuminating traits of fear, anger, 
hopelessness, doubt &ndash; to the point of such rarity that they inspire art 
and literature in multiple forms&hellip; it&rsquo;s ridiculously thrilling! I 
suppose you could take a good many literary characters and fit them into those 
parameters, but the other half of the effect is how those characters, with all 
their various gifts and flaws, are able to connect with the intended audience. 
This is where superhero stories are brilliant; they use themes and situations 
that have enthralled humanity for centuries, and then they twist them just so 
as to touch a certain cord, a nerve that could affect the way someone sees and 
confronts the world.</p> 
<p>And then there is the factor of what I like to call the Don Quixote 
Syndrome. One cannot discuss the influence that heroes have on people for very 
long without bringing up Don Quixote, so here he is. Don Quixote is a<i>genius
</i>. He absorbs all these beautiful stories of daring and bravery and heroic 
adventure, and then decides that he is not living up to the sort of person he 
believes he could be, so he goes out and literally becomes the author, the 
creator of his own life, his own adventures! How Brilliant is that?!! The 
entire theory of The Quest, (as exemplified in the song The Impossible Dream 
from the musical version,) is something that ought to be on the first page of 
the handbook for any hero, fictional or not.</p> 
<p>If The Avengers movie possesses even one of these compelling and 
fascinating characteristics, then the ongoing Quest of all Heroes has been more 
than fulfilled, and will continue to be incredibly inspiring. Now excuse me 
while I go all Don Quixote-ish on everyone and run off to sword fight a pine 
tree. (Pine tree? What pine tree? It&rsquo;s obviously a dragon.:)</p> 
<p><i>(Side note: I just realized that when drawing parallels between the 
Avengers and Don Quixote, your character turns into a windmill or something. 
Congratulations. :)</i></p> </li>

<p>Nah, your examples of British comics are all excellent of course, but 
Watchmen, the Invisibles, and even the second half of V for Vendetta where paid 
for by the American industry you so despise. And let's face it, Watchmen was 
riffing off established Charlston Comics heros, and Invisibles similarly riffed 
off DCs Superscouts (and went on to become Best.Comic.Ever, partly because it 
taught me enough chaos magic to conjour up my beloved sports car... But that's 
another story)</p> 
<p>And it took (American financed again) Robocop to be the best &quot;Judge 
Dredd&quot; movie so far made, but Iron Man has a more sophisticated wit and 
irony than Verhoven's classic (except for the last dreadful battle with Iron 
Monger, which almost ruins the film).</p> </li>

<p>I'd say movies - and especially superhero movies - are more about escapism 
than truth.</p> 
<p>Although sometimes I think I might just be a bit contrary. Dark Knight is 
about the most over-rated film ever, by the way...</p> </li>

<p>Most super hero films have a simple mantra, might is right. It maybe 
dressed up in soul searching and angst, but in the end, if we can punch you 
harder, we win, you lose.</p> 
<p>These films never have shades of grey. The Dark Knight, might do dark 
things, but the audience knows he&rsquo;s the good guy, there for its fine for 
him to use torture or anything necessary to win the day.</p> 
<p>And even though I enjoy the odd superhero film, so many are formulaic 
it&rsquo;s untrue. The Iron man and Incredible Hulk plots are exactly the same, 
ending with them fighting an evil version of themselves. Also see Spiderman 3, 
any film with Wolverine in, etc.</p> 
<p>But here&rsquo;s the flaw with Super Hero films, it&rsquo;s the fact the 
Guys, (and rarely women) are SUPER. They are invincible. There is a lack of 
dramatic tension, because at the end of the day, they win, and at worst 
they&rsquo;ve dirtied up their spandex.</p> 
<p>It&rsquo;s the bad guys that hold any interest. They are flawed, damaged 
and ultimately more human, even if that is monstrously human, than the good 
guy, hand on nipple, god bless America types.</p> 
<p>In the end all super hero films have the same conclusion. Bad guys evil 
plan, no matter how good, how brilliant, how ingenious, will be thwarted, 
usually by a guy in a costume, punching him or by an act of physical 
superiority. The message of the films, all problems can be solved via violence 
and being stronger. Brawn beats brain.</p> </li>

<p>ok, i admit, in my youtube zomboid phase, i watched all the avengers 
movies...well a whole slew of them...thor being the first, and how clever of 
the marvel production to leave the films on, in preparation for what i assume 
is the one you are promoting.</p> 
<p>having no love lost nor lovelorn for the genre, i appreciate a populist 
movie that is well made just as much an auteur's work. it is what the creative 
minds bring to the screen both by shaping it on and off the screen.</p> 
<p>i was amazed how much like the movies, thor was much better than captain 
america and finally comes iron man (imo). credit HAS to be given to the 
production house thats brings in a branagh to do the film...and his involvement 
clearly rises the bar all around for that film...the acting was very well 
done...and you in particular mr. hiddleston, have NOTHING to apologize for 
being a part of that film. it is rather telling that you do, considering you 
have written this article...logic being if there was nothing to apologize for, 
why write something telling everyone that there is nothing to apologize for?</p>
<p>and the actor, helmsworth i think, who played thor did a wonderful job as 
well...modulating the transition between cockiness (may be a little too well 
done there) to humility and effortless sacrifice...i do love watching good 
performances and well made movies that are not pretentious.</p> 
<p>there, so please take back my appreciation to your cast and crew, and i am 
as far from the programmed audience of teenage american boys as you can get: an 
adult international woman of not unrefined tastes.</p> </li>

<p>now i feel a bit guilty at not having mentioned the others who did very 
well as well. mr, or is it sir anthony was a fantastic casting, and nothing 
need be said about his acting here that he is not already laureled for. the 
female lead, sorry i am forgetting her name, i find her more than a bit 
annoying (in general, sorry, it happens) but here, it worked...she managed to 
not annoy me at all. natalie.....?</p> 
<p>i even liked the characterizations of minor players, like her assistant and 
the shield person...there was intelligence and humanity that runs all through 
this film, that i am glad in more than one ways...not being able to sit through 
more than a part of the vile transformers thing (also on said youtube zomboid 
phase) i can only be grateful that intelligent and smart, and more importantly 
humane alternatives appear in that field of blockbustering.</p> 
<p>you should be really proud of your participation and your work in the film 
- i know i would be (and trust me that is saying a lot, considering my haughty 
disdain, hardly healthy i know, nevertheless, that kept me firmly back on the 
new york off-off stage as a demented sacramental theatre artiste...)</p> </li>

<p>20 April 2012 10:38AM</p> 
<p>Great article. Makes me feel compelled to chime in with my 2 cents, for 
what it's worth.</p> 
<p>First has to be props for Christopher Reeve and Richard Donner, who set the 
template for all superhero movie right out of the gate. And with regard to the 
Superman films I'd have to disagree with an earlier poster that these films 
have a mantra of &quot;might is right&quot;.</p> 
<p>3 things from the first 2 Superman movies will always stay with me:</p> 
<p>First is Christopher Reeves' grief stricken roar at finding Louis Lane 
dead. That acting moment alone always completely sells me on the arguably 
bobbins deus ex machina of changing the earth's rotational spin to turn back 
time. (And I'll admit to fanwanking this into him travelling faster than the 
speed of light so that things appear to be travelling backwards in time, but 
that's just my fannish bent).</p> 
<p>Second is the little character moment in the 1st film at the end of the 
helicopter/skyscraper scene - the first out and out &quot;This is 
Superman!&quot; bit of the movie. After saving Louis, saving the pilot and 
bringing the helicopter safely to the ground amongst a group of astonished and 
cheering onlookers the first thing out of Superman's mouth is &quot;This man 
needs help&quot;. That's the perfect characterisation of Superman right there. 
That's his introduction to the people of Metropolis.</p> 
<p>Finally, in Superman 2, when Louis guesses his secret. With nothing more 
than a change in posture Reeves transforms before our eyes from Clark Kent into 
Superman, with no whizz-bang or special effects. The veil drops and he seems to 
grow six inches and suddenly Superman is standing in front of Louis. It's a 
wonderful moment of screen magic, a wonderful piece of acting from both 
parties, and we are privvy to this invulnerable impossibly good man at his most 
vulnerable.</p> 
<p>I'd like to imagine that Reeves' peers, who gave him stick for taking the 
role, realised the error of their judgement once they saw the product. 
Especially the final shot of the first movie. How the hell did they manage to 
pull off something as cheesy - on paper - as Supes breaking the 4th wall and 
waving to the audience. Maybe the score helped, but it certainly sent me out of 
the theatre with a massive goofy grin on my face. Wonderful stuff.</p> </li>

<p>Thank you for a piece that knows that at heart every story is about the 
character. It doesn't matter if the story is about superheroes or a damaged boy 
named Kevin or a retired spy named George, if you can't be brought to care 
about these people then the film will be just another piece of popcorn fluff.

<p>Comics are something that has stayed with me my entire life since reading 
my first Spiderman comic when I was 6. As Hiddleston refers to, as a child you 
referred your life to the incidents you had read about or seen on the screen. 
Marvel comics allowed me to having a reading age of 12 when I was 7. I devoured 
them, I learnt from them, I saw things I would never have seen through them. 
Comics made me the reader I am today. They got me into learning, to loving the 
medium of literature and I guess that's the same for a lot of adults today. Yet 
we frown on them, calling them childish, immature, whilst watching the same 
generic crap on TV every day of the week.</p> 
<p>As for films, Superman I &amp; II stood out as the only good examples of 
the genre that made it to the screen prior to Burton bringing Batman to us in 
1989. The game changed from Batman Returns, one of the few examples of a sequel 
being far superior to the film it followed. I don't however like DC Comics much 
at all, I have always found them rather trite. Characters like the Green 
Lantern, The Flash, Wonder Woman have always left me completely cold. Superman 
as I grew up became my least favourite hero ever, because he was so perfect.</p>
<p>As technology has finally caught up with the medium, it has allowed 
generations of fans to finally see our heroes on the screen as we imagined they 
would look like, act like, the massive destruction of these heroes and villains 
in front of our very eyes. I have thoroughly enjoyed the latest raft, purely 
because The Avengers has always been my favourite comic in Marvel's canon. The 
team ethic, the triumph over insurmountable odds, the gigantic fights, the 
divorces, the marriages, the losses the team has endured of the decades. The 
pulling together of a group of people from consistently different backgrounds 
to work together has always been the DNA that holds the Avengers together.</p> 
<p>@SpartacusMars clearly doesn't like anything American, preferring to big up 
the British end of comics, but as another poster has pointed out, Moore's work 
could only have appeared if it was for American comics money. We have a whole 
raft of fantastic writers and artists working in the medium now, many have 
passed through the 2000AD academy as it were, to prove themselves in America. 
Watchmen is a DC comic, but you then slate American comics whilst then using an 
American film as a great example. Robocop is nothing like Judge Dredd at all. 
Murphy's humanity is something Dredd would probably shoot himself over. Joe has 
no capacity to see outside of the law, Murphy is the exact opposite. Other than 
the violence, it has no resemblance to Judge Dredd whatsoever. The characters 
are polar opposites of each other. The Invisibles isn't very good at all but 
here it fits pre-defined prejudices clearly. Moore has written several of my 
favourite stories ever, V for Vendetta, Watchmen, From Hell, League Of 
Extraordinary Gentleman I, II, III and IV but he's produced some utter bollocks 
as well. Or do we discount those because he's British?</p> 
<p>Ellis, Millar, Ennis, Moore, Grant are giants in the field because of the 
opportunity Marvel &amp; DC gave them and long may it continue. Comics like 
Preacher, The Authority, Transmetropolitan would never have been printed in 
this country at all. The American publishers should be thanked for letting our 
guys unleash their warped minds on their readers.</p> 
<p>I cannot wait to see the Avengers next week. I've waited 33 years to see 
something like this.</p> </li>

<p>Chris Reeve as Superman is, and always shall be, the definitive Superhero 
performance in any comic book film. No other Superman can ever match up to him, 
and no other actor has ever conveyed the same hope as any other superhero.</p> 
<p>Shame that Hiddleston constantly references The Dark Knight, aside from 
Ledger's powerful performance it's the most overrated film for years. Give me

<p>Love your acting and passion, Tom. However, I disagree on your take on the 
superhero genre in Hollywood. I agree mostly with SpartacusMars. (Thor was a 
little different; felt the family drama dimension made it a bit more 
interesting). Another thing about the cult of the hero (Joseph Cambell etc) is 
that it has thrown us back in the arms of Gods and Destiny (John Ralston Saul) 
in our civic lives. I think as much as popular culture has had a tangible 
influence on how we live our lives s as participating individuals, it has been 
to our detriment. Heroism in pop culture may have something interesting to 
contribute to self-examination and self-realisation; however, it has little 
positive effect on how to live as a participating, responsible individual in 
society.</p> </li>

<p>Oh dear, now I love Tom Hiddleston even more. Very well-written article and 
spoken like a true former student of the classics. In years to come superheroes 
will be looked on as the enduring mythology of our time. They've certainly 
always been something that fascinates me.</p> 
<p>It's about time that comics and the films that are adapted from them stop 
being dismissed as pointless fluff. A good superhero film (which The Avengers 
is - I've seen it) is an exciting, immersive, moving experience and they - and 
the people involved in making them - should be celebrated.</p> </li>

<p>nothing wrong with the idea of superhero films. but they have to be done 
well (which by all accounts this latest one is). the majority are terribly 
done. that's ok, the majority of films are terribly done. but if it's good, 
that's what counts. not what genre it is. no superhero film is automatically 
good or bad, in the same way no film is automatically good or bad. it's all in 
the execution.</p> </li>

<p>Hardly a fair comparison. All of the British examples you have used where 
created 30-40 years after the American ones you compared them too. Over which 
time the genre had evolved significantly. Comparing a character first created 
in WW2 (Captain America) with one created in the late 70&rsquo;s (Judge Dredd) 
is totally inappropriate.</p> </li>

<p>Reeve set the benchmark undoubtedly, and (in my humble) he set the bar so 
high it's never been touched.</p> 
<p>I love Michael Keaton's Bruce Wayne.</p> 
<p>I think the fight between spidey and Doc Oc in Spiderman 2 that ranges from 
skyscrapers to the train is to date the single most spectacular superhero 
action scene ever.</p> 
<p>I adore Christopher Nolan's take on Batman - can't wait for his final 
outing later in the year - and Ledger's Joker was something else entriely. He's 
the high water mark of &quot;super villains&quot;. It's one of the few film 
performances I've seen where (again in my humble) the actor is invisible from 
start to finish. That's the goddamn Joker up there on the screen! And the first 
time I watched it - especially after the &quot;magic trick&quot; - I realised 
that the game had changed. This wasn't villainy by rote - this character could 
do the unexpected at almost every term. Real threat. Real unpredictability. I 
groaned when he gave his origin story....but later when he gave an alternate 
origin I grinned like the Cheshire Cat.</p>

<p>Er, @Scrunge, on behalf of the legions of fans of the recent Marvel films, 
let me assure you that many of the most hardcore are female.</p> 
<p>Loki, in fact, is one of the best written and most complex characters I 
have seen in film in the last year and Tom portrayed him so sympathetically 
that - with absolutely no disrespect to Chris - I felt greater empathy toward 
Loki than I did Thor. And before assumptions are made, while Tom is a very 
handsome chap, this is not a matter influenced by my ovaries.</p> 
<p>In recent times, the only films I can honestly say that I have found truly 
enjoyable have been comic adaptions or Simon Pegg/Nick Frost projects. 
Everything else appears to be over-hyped American comedies in which the cast 
are perpetually drunk off their tits, action targeting those with a lower IQ 
than their packet of popcorn, overly-grotesque slasher horror (bonus facepalm 
points for found footage), or Terribly, Terribly British, haw-haw comedy-drama 
or Look At the Rich People.</p> 
<p>The majority of films these days tend to fall into the brackets of utterly 
mindless or overly 'poignant' and dreary. Good superhero films combine the best 
elements of action, human identity, perceptions of morality, aspirational 
fantasty and humour. Dismissing that as being &quot;for the fanboys&quot; is 
laughably pretentious.</p> </li>

<p><br>
I'm not really a fan of Nolan's take on Batman, the need to make it 
ultra realistic, to me, makes them less fun. They make for decent thrillers but 
to me Batman is about gothic detective action and at times horror. Ledger was a 
great Joker but I want to see the truly psychopathic Joker from the comics, the 
one who killed Jason Todd and crippled Barbara Gordon just for the hell of it.

<p>The problem with the superhero films is they've lost their freshness. The 
1978 Superman film had real heart to it and there's been a decline ever since. 
Even Superman jumped the shark with the 3rd and 4th sequels. With the odd 
exception most superhero films have been utterly wooden or gormless or both. 
Iron Man 2 and Captain America were truly terrible and Avengers looks like more 
of the same.</p> </li>

which these truths can be explored. In our increasingly secular society...</p> 
</blockquote> 
<p>They offer a popular mythology, yes. Does it really reflect truths we all 
agree on? These are American made products, which aggressively push an American 
agenda. Not only American - right wing.</p> 
<p>Superhero comics grew up after the banning of the EC horror comics, 
remember. Superheroes were always the stories that got the approval of the 
Comics Code authority, unlike the horror and true crime tales that came before 
them. The supervillians are more interesting, becuase they are the monsters 
from the horror comics redressed.</p> 
<p>Superhoeroes are easy to love and enjoy, but to the European reader, they 
will always be problematic becuase of their unironic right wing agenda, .</p> 
<p>While America gives us Batman, embodiment of the trickle down theory, 
Europe comes back with master criminal superhero Diabolik. The League of 
Extrordinary Gentlemen basicaly points outt hat all the superhero characters 
are stolen from classic and pulp literature, redressed slightly and copyrighted.
</p> 
<p>Superheroes are fun, and they do present a mythology. But it's one we 
beware of embracing uncritically.</p> </li>

&quot;In the end all super hero films have the same conclusion. 
Bad guys evil plan, no matter how good, how brilliant, how ingenious, will be 
thwarted, usually by a guy in a costume, punching him or by an act of physical 
superiority. The message of the films, all problems can be solved via violence 
and being stronger. Brawn beats brain.&quot;</p> 
<p>You obviously haven't been watching closely enough - almost all superhero 
films involve the hero fighting a physically stronger enemy. Ironmonger, 
Abomination, Sabretooth are all bigger and physically stronger than Ironman, 
Hulk and Wolverine. The villain often uses their brains to become stronger than 
the hero, or handicap the hero (eg Kryptonite Island in the Superman reboot). 
The heroes always beat them by using their brains or cunning. Likewise 
Spiderman is usually weaker than whatever villain he is fighting, but usually 
wins through science.</p> </li>

<p>I don't think anyone does scorn superhero films any more, do they? Once Tim 
Burton's Batman and, later on, Bryan Singer's X-Men proved that it was possible 
to make a well-crafted film based around a comic book source, they've been 
accepted as a valid, not-automatically-trashy, genre.</p> </li>

<p>Is this what the morality of superheroes has taught thee?</p> 
<p>Superheroes like any media genre will cater (and pander) to a diverse group 
of people.<br>
Some are looking for drama (<br>
Some action with powers 
(Superman)<br>
Some action with sleuthing (Batman)<br>
Some action with humour 
(spiderman)<br>
Some action with soap opera and hookups(X-Men)<br>
Some action 
with a touch of Romance (Various)</p> 
<p>And some (not me though) enjoy ogling at tasty Superpowered underdressed 
babes<br>

<p>They're fantastic tales with protagonists sporting greek-god type powers</p>
<p>The movies, however, can be stupendous or they can be rank.<br>

<p><b>You misread that thread entirely</b>. I do not claim any national 
superiority. The response was to a (seeming) Republican claiming superiority of 
the US over the UK for having elected a black president. I responded that the 
Americas have had black people for hundreds of years longer than Britain, but 
that the longer-term immigrants to Britain, the Jewish community, has seen both 
Prime Ministers and other other party leaders. It was not intended to assert 
superiority so much as simply inform of the facts.</p> 
<p>I do see a difference between the characters of 2000AD and the characters 
from the Marvel studios. If you do not you do not. If you do not see the 
difference between (say) Jack Snyder and Paul Vehooven (the very non-English 
Dutchman whose film I also quoted) then you simply do not.</p> </li>

<p>The seemingly endless conveyor belt of formulaic comic book films is more 
evidence of how culturally bankrupt Hollywood really is. I bet they're glad 
that there's enough mainstream simpleton 'geeks' lapping up their ideas deficit.

<p>&quot;I think the fight between spidey and Doc Oc in Spiderman 2 that 
ranges from skyscrapers to the train is to date the single most spectacular 
superhero action scene ever.&quot;</p> 
<p>It's also incredibly moving when the people on the subway come to Spidey's 
aid.<br>

<p>Very geeky but... When considering superheroes, you can't ignore arguably 
the first real (in my opinion and knowledge, which is minimal), 'favoured by 
the gods' superhero - Odysseus in the Odyssey. The Odyssey was infuriatingly 
simplistic - 'good' people could do horrific things (Telemachus' slaying of 
Penelope's suitors etc etc) but it was irrelevant because they were chosen by 
the gods. I'm aware that is over-simplifying everything a lot, but I think it's 
an interesting contrast between the treatment of heroes in two pieces (the 
Iliad and the Odyssey) that arise in the same period of history.</p> 
<p>Geek-out over. Sorry about that...</p> </li>

<p>Exploring truths doesn't mean embracing a mythology uncritically - the very 
opposite in fact.</p> 
<p>Every mythology is rooted in some sort of political outlook, and American 
superhero stories don't have a monopoly on reactionary politics (Tolkien, 
anyone?). The morality behind Greek mythology appears positively alien to us in 
the 21st Century, but we can still enagage with its heroes and Gods.</p> 
<p>If anything, engaging with a mythology whose ideals we don't agree with is 
a great way of thinking about which values we believe are actually worthwhile.

<p>These films are just simplistic - albeit sometimes entertaining - nonsense.
</p> 
<p>Moreover, the 'good' guys always win, which is nothing like the real world. 
This is damaging, because it acts as a kind of displacement or compensation for

<p>Yeah, like the end of The Dark Knight where a corrupted Harvey Dent dies 
and Batman takes responsibility for his crimes post mortem in order to keep the 
ideal that Dent turned his back on alive. The Dark Knight condemed and hunted 
so that the idea of a White Knight could remain untainted. Bam! Pow! Might is 
Right! I don't buy it...</p> </li>
