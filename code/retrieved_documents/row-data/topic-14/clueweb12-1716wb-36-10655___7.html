 Amore, Morphea, Tulip and Crystal are 
always excited to have visitors. As you approach them, they jump and turn in 
little circles, and once you're close enough, they strain to stick their faces 
through the chicken-wire fence, because they want to sniff your hands and gnaw 
on your sleeves. These girls are curious, friendly and almost eerily smart. A 
hand-painted sign above their pen proudly declares where you are: The Goat 
Co-Op.<br>
<br>
 The Goat Co-Op -- which is also known as Miel y Leche -- is 
about a year and a half old and located off West Alameda, on land past Siler 
Road where property lines become unclear and farm-animal sightings more common. 
Miel y Leche is the second goat collective off of West Alameda, and joins an 
established co-op known as The West Alameda Goat Milkers, just a short drive up 
the road. The two co-ops aren't affiliated, but they share a love of goats and 
local food.<br>
<br>
 The Goat Milkers have been around for 15 years and house 
three goats: Itsy, Reba and Souffl&eacute;. On a recent weekday afternoon, Goat 
Milkers member and local lawyer Cordelia Friedman walked up to the pen where 
the goats live. Everyone was happy to see one another. &quot;Like all modern 
animals, they know the sound of a plastic bag,&quot; Friedman said as she 
readied treats for the animals. &quot;Come see why carrots are the crack 
cocaine of the goat world,&quot; she joked. Itsy, Souffl&eacute; and Reba 
crowded against one another and strained their necks to gobble carrot sticks 
from Friedman's outstretched hands. &quot;Reba is especially naughty because 
she's a teenager,&quot; Friedman said as she stroked Reba's head.<br>
<br>
 
&quot;I didn't know anything about goats when we got started, but I was willing 
to try,&quot; said Mike Nestor, a founding member of Miel y Leche who lives on 
the co-op property with his wife and two children. The learning curve has been 
steep, he said, but enjoyable, too.<br>
<br>
 Nestor is a builder and led 
construction of the goats' living quarters. At both co-ops, the goats live 
alongside flocks of chickens, and at Miel y Leche, a turkey, too. &quot;Goats 
are strong animals, they're active, and they're smart and social,&quot; Nestor 
said. &quot;The design of the pens needs to be tight. It's really interesting 
to watch them together; they have complex relationships.&quot;<br>
<br>
 Amore 
is Tulip's mother, and Morphea is Crystal's, and the design of the pens 
reflects these relationships. Generally, the two younger goats are kept 
together in one pen while their mothers are in another. This arrangement 
discourages nursing, although each kid can be paired with an older goat that's 
not its mother -- goats don't allow kids who aren't their offspring to nurse.
<br> <br>
 Miel y Leche and Goat Milkers each have about 10 members, made up of 
individuals and families. At both co-ops, members share the costs of owning 
goats, which include feed (grain if they're lactating or pregnant, hay if 
they're not) vet visits and stud fees. (At Goat Milkers, Souffl&eacute; is 
pregnant, and Miel y Leche hopes that both Tulip and Crystal are, too.)<br>
<br>
 Decision-making is a group process, and deliberations vary widely: from what 
kind of feed to use, whether to opt for homeopathy or Western medicine when the 
goats get sick, and what to do when a male goat is born. &quot;[Members] don't 
have to be like-minded, but you do have to figure out how you're going to deal 
with these things,&quot; Nestor said.<br>
<br>
 Members of both co-ops take on 
different responsibilities that suit their skills and interests. Everyone 
contributes to tasks like mucking the pens, maintaining fencing and structures, 
and making sure all members are up to date on everything goaty, whether in a 
written logbook or a Google Group.<br>
<br>
 Nobody joins a co-op for a cheap 
goat-milk fix. &quot;For sure, it's much easier to go to the store and buy 
goat's milk,&quot; said Alessandra Haines, who, along with her husband, Steve, 
is a member of Miel y Leche. &quot;But part of the experience is taking care of 
them and learning about them.&quot;<br>
<br>
 &quot;People say goat cheese is 
so expensive, and you're like, have you ever milked a goat?&quot; Friedman 
said. Milking is tricky at first (really -- it's not as easy as it looks) and 
Friedman said new co-op members practice air-milking to build up hand strength.
<br> <br>
 Many goat experiences are learn-as-you-go. Haines, for instance, is 
in charge of trimming the goats' hooves. &quot;My friend the farrier taught me 
how,&quot; she said, and lifted Morphea's leg to demonstrate how to trim excess 
growth along the edge of the hoof with garden shears.<br>
<br>
 The benefits of 
belonging to a cooperative are at once obvious and hard-to-define. There's the 
physical product, about a half-gallon of milk per goat per day. Goats are 
milked twice daily, in the early morning and in the evening. Members drink the 
milk -- especially if they have young children -- and can choose to pasteurize 
it or not. Many people make cheese, kefir and yogurt. Nestor said his summer 
plans include experimenting with ice cream. Belonging to a co-op has benefits 
beyond the milk, too, like control over what goes into the goats, learning new 
skills and the ultimate in localized production: making food from start to 
finish by yourself.<br>
<br>
 &quot;Building and maintaining relationships with 
your food is weirdly rewarding,&quot; Haines said. &quot;Whether it's a garden 
or chickens or goats, the ongoing process of taking care of and investing 
energy in food production heightens appreciation of our interdependent 
relationships with animals and plants. And everything tastes better!&quot;<br>

<br> Goat co-ops are DIY in action, farmyard experiential learning, started by 
adventurous folks who are willing to try something new. But raising goats isn't 
always easy. One of Goat Milkers' newborn kids died last year, and Tulip, one 
of Miel y Leche's younger goats, has long, sharp -- and potentially dangerous 
-- horns because they weren't cauterized early enough.<br>
<br>
 &quot;It's not 
about us and how cute we think they are,&quot; Friedman said. &quot;We've 
learned a lot -- you get a little less starry-eyed about husbandry. It doesn't 
always comport with your ideas about how you think things should go.&quot;<br>

<br> Nestor echoed this statement. &quot;Animal husbandry can be pretty 
harsh,&quot; he said. &quot;There's a certain number of people who get into 
co-ops that aren't ready for that. For instance, you need to cauterize the nubs 
that their horns grow from pretty early on. I was holding Crystal when the vet 
did it; it's like being next to a barbecue. [The animal] is in a ton of pain, 
the vet's going through layers of flesh to get to the skull. But then the goat 
doesn't get horns.&quot;<br>
<br>
 Despite setbacks and unknowns, each co-op is 
thriving. Baby goats are expected this summer, and members are committed both 
to the goats (which they love) and to thinking carefully about local food 
sources.<br>
<br>
 &quot;Once you get to know the goats and care for them, you 
get a sense of responsibility, and that's appropriate,&quot; Friedman said. 
&quot;You can't let the goats go unmilked or unfed. Everyone has to chip in 
during the hardest times. It takes a lot to keep them happy and healthy.&quot;
<br> <br>
 Belonging to a co-op indicates a deliberate, deep engagement in 
community and with food. &quot;I like good food, but I'm not a moralist about 
it,&quot; Nestor said. &quot;But, I do think it's good for us all to know more 
about what we eat, and to enjoy it more. One way to do this is to produce your 
own.&quot;<br>
<br>
 Of course, goat love is hardly a side-benefit of co-op 
membership. Watching Souffl&eacute;, Itsy and Reba frolic in the sun, Friedman 
leaned in conspiratorially. &quot;People do get very smitten with the 
goats,&quot; she said.<br>
