<h1>Traditional Medicine in Contemporary China</h1> 
<p><i>Traditional Chinese Medicine enjoys high status in China, which is good 
for the health of the nation. Dr. Mae-Wan Ho reports.</i></p>

<p>Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) is fully institutionalised and supported 
by the Chinese government, and very much a part of the contemporary Chinese 
healthcare system.</p> 
<p>It delivers almost 40% of total healthcare services, and like western 
biomedicine, is predominantly based in hospitals. There are almost 3000 
dedicated hospitals for TCM, and over 95% of western medical hospitals also 
have fully-fledged Chinese medicine wards and outpatient departments.</p> 
<p> TCM is practiced in its own right, integrated with western medicine, or 
used to enhance the effectiveness of western medical treatments. In practice, 
however, the distinction among the three ways of delivering TCM is blurred. 
Western biomedical concepts and ideas have been assimilated into Chinese 
medicine, and western drugs are routinely prescribed in Chinese-medicine wards 
and outpatients departments. TCM physicians, for their part, face pressure from 
hospitals to use revenue-generating biomedical diagnostic facilities such as 
ultrasound and computed tomography.</p> 
<p> TCM is also used by the China to promote Chinese culture. It is defined as 
a &#145;national treasure&#146;, which might have further insulated it from 
debate as a science. Though such a debate should include a thorough critique on 
the conceptual and practical deficiencies of the mainstream scientific model 
itself, which is not what the majority who wants a debate has in mind.</p> 
<p>The need to promote positive perceptions of TCM abroad is forcing internal 
changes, nevertheless. For example, there are efforts to prohibit the use of 
endangered species in preparation of TCM drugs, and to use research methods 
acceptable to the dominant international drugs market, although this may not be 
appropriate in many cases, and reflects an unquestioned acceptance of the 
dominant reductionist medical model (see Globalisation Chinese medicine, this 
series).</p> 
<p> It could be argued that the strongest proof of the efficacy of TCM is the 
high level of public support in China. A familiar sight that has remained 
unchanged over the years of turmoil in China is the morning<i>qigong</i> 
exercises practiced in the streets by millions of Chinese people.</p> 
<p>More importantly, self-prescribed, ready-made Chinese medicines are an 
important part of the people&#146;s therapeutic regime. This includes a 
bewildering array of &#145;quick dissolve&#146; herbal health drinks for 
treating or preventing a range of diseases, from cancer and diabetes to 
inflammation, influenza and toxicity; or else, like ginseng, they simply 
&#145;regulate the body&#146; to promote a general state of health. The 
ingredients are typically a mixture of well-known herbs and flowers or food 
items.</p> 
<p>Chinese people take responsibility for their own health most seriously, and 
the use of medicine and disease prevention forms a continuum with food and 
nutrition. Although most Chinese people may believe in the superior diagnostic 
powers of western biomedicine, many prefer TCM treatments particularly for 
chronic diseases where the side effects of western biomedicine are seen, 
rightly, to often far outweigh the benefits.</p> 
<p> The Chinese government is pressing hard for the systematisation of TCM 
disease categories, diagnostic standards, and therapeutic techniques, and to 
enforce a more stringent evaluation of therapeutic outcomes. At the same time, 
however, the scientific status of TCM is not being doubted, it is decreed<i>a 
priori</i> by the state. </p> 
<p>One must remember, however, that TCM has thousands of years of accumulated 
experience and knowledge behind it, and the government&#146;s support for it is 
crucial to prevent the kind of inter-professional struggles with the dominant 
western biomedical model that have impeded the wide adoption of traditional 
medicines in other countries such as Malaysia and India.</p> 
<p> The World Health Organisation unveiled its first Global Strategy for 
Traditional and Complementary Alternative Medicine in January 2002, to promote 
integrating traditional medicine into national health systems globally. This is 
an opportunity to build safe, affordable and effective national health systems, 
especially for Third World countries rich in both medicinal plant resources and 
traditional knowledge. China will be closely watched as an example, for better 
or for worse, as she is actively pushing for global acceptance of her 
traditional remedies and competing in the global drugs market.</p>
