<h3>Dr. Moran Weighs In</h3> 
<p>In last week&rsquo;s post, I dubbed Dr. Peter Moran the 
&ldquo;conscience&rdquo; of SBM, citing his commitment to doing what&rsquo;s 
best for individual patients even if, in theory at least, that may involve some 
manner of benign but fanciful treatments. I countered with my own opinion that 
honesty and integrity are necessary parts&nbsp;of any discussion with a 
patient, and that they, in turn, must not conflict with science and reason.* I 
added passages from a couple of key medical ethics treatises to support my 
assertion. Dr. Moran&rsquo;sresponse, thoughtful and provocative as always, was 
buried in the midst of other commenters&rsquo; tangential arguments about the 
theory of evolution. Rather than continue its exile there, I reprint it here to 
give it the exposure that it deserves:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>A blatant appeal to authority, but one that I mostly agree with. The 
difference between us is that I insist that medicine is about an infinite 
number of individual contexts and I see many examples where ethical absolutes 
(actually these are ethical guidelines rather than directives) do not apply or 
don&rsquo;t seem to apply very well.</p> 
<p>We scientists are ever-so cautious when making scientific judgments about 
complex matters; let&rsquo;s not pretend that arriving at absolutes in medical 
ethics is a piece of cake, especially when it is not quite clear how anything 
done with the undiluted welfare of the individual patient in mind can be 
entirely unethical. I mean, why are we obliged to consider the impact of our 
decisions upon the fate of the planets (or whatever) when THIS patient needs 
help? In fact, at least one medical ethicist has gone so far as to state that 
it is not unethical for a doctor to prescribe a placebo treatment, so long as 
the doctor believes it will benefit the patient. I don&rsquo;t quite agree with 
that bald statement &mdash; there should be a rider specifying that this may 
apply to *some* contexts where there is no obviously superior evidence-based 
method.</p> 
<p>Here are some examples of the intellectual minefield we have to negotiate.
</p> 
<p>1. All the doctors I know would be prepared to call in the witch-doctor if 
it would help assuage the fears, or help in the management, of a seriously ill 
primitive tribesman. It seems we are prepared to pander to the superstitions of 
SOME cultures while despising any similar inclinations in our own.</p> 
<p>2. I have previously asked this question which has to do with public policy 
in relation to safe &ldquo;alternatives&rdquo;. Take my word for it that every 
pharmacy in Europe displays &ldquo;Homeopathie&rdquo; (or language equivalents) 
in large letters outside. Would skeptics prefer those using such remedies for 
their minor and self-limiting complaints to be using NSAIDs or antibiotics or 
antidepressants instead, treatments that will often in such contexts themselves 
perform no better than placebo, but at substantially greater risks? Behind the 
usual healthfraud position there is both an exaggeration of the capacity of 
modern medicine and insufficient recognition of the harm that it can do. We 
definitely do not yet have entirely safe and 100% effective solutions to all of 
mankind&rsquo;s ills, and certain imperfections of everyday medical practice 
can heighten the risks of the use of unnecessarily powerful pharmaceuticals. So 
what is the safest and most pragmatically realistic position here?</p> 
<p>3. Following on from that &mdash; what is the evidence-based answer to 
non-specific tiredness and unhappiness? If people feel better for taking a 
multivitamin or an innocuous herb, why should we care? We keep on offering the 
public temporary answers to these things, prescribing (historically) 
amphetamines, cocaine, opiates, barbiturates and phenothiazines in massive 
quantities, only to take them away when problems such as addiction ensue. Is it 
right to then turn around and say, well you didn&rsquo;t really need these 
things anyway, even denying them any relief that they may derive from 
&ldquo;pretend medicines&rdquo;. The science that matters will be argued out in 
other arenas.</p> 
<p>That&rsquo;s to give you some idea of the kind of thing that I am on about. 
You seem to think I am talking about doctors promoting CAM or placebo treatment 
as a matter of policy. I am not prepared to go that far, although I think I 
understand why some doctors might do that.</p> </blockquote> 
<p>I agree that &ldquo;medicine is about an infinite number of individual 
contexts and&nbsp;[there are]&nbsp;many examples where ethical absolutes do not 
apply or don&rsquo;t seem to apply very well.&rdquo; Nor did I really think 
that Dr. Moran was &ldquo;talking aboutdoctors promoting &lsquo;CAM&rsquo; or 
placebo treatments as a matter of policy.&rdquo; We disagree&nbsp;elsewhere, 
but&nbsp;he makes some interesting points.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>The most compelling, in my opinion, is his point about &ldquo;calling in 
witch doctors.&rdquo; Yes, I would not be the first exception to that 
rule.&nbsp;I do have a response, however, and it&nbsp;has to do with 
the&nbsp;differences between&nbsp;some cultures and our own: the fallacy is 
that there are &ldquo;similar inclinations.&rdquo;&nbsp;There is a vast 
difference between the traditional, deeply held opinions of a primitive 
tribesman and his witch doctor, on the one hand, and the addled opinions of a 
born, raised, and (partially) educated&nbsp;American or European or Australian 
patient and hissnake oil peddling quack on the other.&nbsp;Those in our 
culture, with occasional exceptions, were not brought up to believe in 
&ldquo;CAM.&rdquo; Many quacks are themselves physicians with no acceptable 
excuse, who until recently were kept in check by strong professional and 
governmental pressures, only to have found themselves reborn in a new &ldquo;
golden age of quackery.&rdquo;&nbsp;Quacks who are not physicians have also 
been kept in check, until recently,&nbsp;by governmental pressures. Their 
newfoundendorsement by governmental edict is no more justified than would be a 
similar endorsement of tribal witch doctors.</p> 
<p>My major objection, as I&rsquo;ve written&nbsp;in my bio and&nbsp;elsewhere 
on SBM, is to &ldquo;implausible claims being promoted, tacitly or otherwise, by
medical schools and government&rdquo; and by physicians. Patients are not the 
problem; they are, if you&rsquo;ll excuse the drama, the victims. Even 
seemingly benign practices, if implausible, can be harmful (&ldquo;first, do no 
harm&rdquo;), particularly&nbsp;when promoted by someone who should know 
better. This isn&rsquo;t the setting for a complete discussion, but it will 
surely come on SBM. In the meantime, there is the unnecessary expense, a 
patient later feeling betrayed by her physician when the treatment 
doesn&rsquo;t work or the &ldquo;placebo effect&rdquo; wears off and she 
realizes that&nbsp;it was&nbsp;only a &ldquo;pretend medicine&rdquo; all along, 
other patients&nbsp;orphysicians concluding that the treatments have validity 
(and possiblybeing convinced to forgo rational treatment), people in general 
losing&nbsp;confidence in&nbsp;modern medicine when it appears that many
physicians can&rsquo;t distinguishbetween the rational and the bogus, wasted 
research funds, human subjects unnecessarily duped and endangered, a befuddled 
media, a befuddled public, befuddled leglislators endorsing quacks to a 
befuddled public, and more.</p> 
<p>Yes, it is true that THIS patient needs help, but if physicians held 
exclusively to that ethic they wouldn&rsquo;t have to concern themselves 
with&nbsp;antibiotic resistance, universal immunizations, judicious use of 
expensive&nbsp;but very low yield tests that are physically harmless and paid 
for with pooled money, or other cost-containment issues that don&rsquo;t 
immediately affect THIS patient, would they?&nbsp;It&rsquo;s true 
that&nbsp;there are many examples where ethical absolutes don&rsquo;t seem to 
apply very well.</p> 
<p>Moving on to number 2: every pharmacy in Europe that advertises 
&ldquo;Homeopathie&rdquo; is committing fraud, plain and simple. If physicians 
were more attentive to science and ethics and to explaining things to patients, 
politicians, and the media, more people would know that. The alternatives to 
homeopathy for minor or self-limiting complaints, moreover, need not be 
&ldquo;NSAIDs or antibiotics or antidepressants&rdquo; unless there is a good 
reason for one of them. The alternative is to explain to the patient that the 
complaint is minor or self-limiting! Why should honesty and integrity be so 
difficult? That some modern physicians prescribe potent drugs solely for 
placebo effects (and to get patients out of their offices) is an indictment of 
that practice, not an argument for &ldquo;CAM.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>There are, moreover, plenty of rational, nonpharmacological treatments for 
all manner of minor or self-limiting complaints (and even for not so 
self-limiting complaints, such as chronic pain), e.g., gargling with hot water 
or sipping hot tea, time, avoiding environmental allergens, smoking cessation, 
weight loss, ice packs or heat packs, rest, exercise, massage (to make muscles 
feel better, not to &ldquo;remove toxins&rdquo;), pain management, physical 
therapy, eating more fibre, &ldquo;sleep hygiene,&rdquo; and many more.</p> 
<p>The answer to point 3 is the same as the answer to point 2, and I certainly 
don&rsquo;t mind if &ldquo;people feel better for taking a multivitamin or an 
innocuous herb&rdquo; (if that were the extent of &ldquo;CAM&rdquo; we&rsquo;d 
hardly be wasting our time here). I just don&rsquo;t think that physicians 
should make false claims. Point 3 also brings psychotherapy to mind. It need 
not be introduced in an unjustified or insulting way, i.e., by implying that 
the patient&rsquo;s symptoms are &ldquo;all in her head&rdquo; or are 
&ldquo;functional&rdquo; or whatever. Rather, the honest physician will admit 
to not being able to explain the symptoms, but acknowledge that they must be 
distressing and suggest that it might be helpful to discuss how they impinge on 
the patient&rsquo;s life and how she might better cope with them.</p> 
<p>There are plenty of modern physicians&nbsp;whose&nbsp;patients are not 
disposed to look elsewhere, even if those patients have &ldquo;nonspecific 
tiredness and unhappiness&rdquo; and even if those physicians don&rsquo;t 
suggest woo. Many patients, perhaps most, expect&nbsp;honesty and integrity, 
and have a pretty good sense of when they see it and when they don&rsquo;t.</p> 
<p>Dr. Moran also added another comment, reproduced in part here:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>The ethical objection to ALL use of CAM, as presented by KA, is problematic 
because of the unspoken assumptions &ndash;</p> </blockquote> 
<blockquote> 
<p>1. That conventional medicine has adequate answers to all health problems 
and the public should be content with what it offers. This applies fairly well 
to some illnesses but not many others.</p> 
<p>2. That &ldquo;alternative&rdquo; methods do nothing worthwhile for those 
using them, anyway. This view is also context sensitive since considerable 
scientific evidence suggests the likelihood of symptom relief by the placebo 
medicines of CAM and from interactions with CAM practitioners.</p> 
<p>3. That science provides a clear discrimination between what works and what 
doesn&rsquo;t. Over the long haul that is true. But what do we mean by 
&ldquo;works&rdquo;? Where does the placebo complex of influences fit in?</p> 
</blockquote> 
<p>Point number 1 is simply incorrect. I have not assumed, nor is the 
assumption&nbsp;inherent in ethical objections to&nbsp;physicians 
promoting&nbsp;&rdquo;CAM,&rdquo; that &ldquo;conventional medicine has 
adequate answers to all health problems.&rdquo; I reject, as I hope I made 
clear above, the false dichotomy that for each health problem there is either a 
proven treatment or there is &ldquo;CAM.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Regarding points 2&nbsp;and 3, I agree&nbsp;that the only 
&ldquo;value&rdquo; of almost all &ldquo;CAM&rdquo; treatments&nbsp;is in their 
&ldquo;placebo effects.&rdquo;&nbsp;But if a physician&rsquo;s quest to elicit 
a placebo effect from an implausible treatment means pretending that the 
treatment has some other effect, specific to the patient&rsquo;s 
problem,&nbsp;then that is a lie. So far, I&rsquo;ve seen nothing to justify 
such a lie.</p> 
<p>There is a potential&nbsp;placebo effect involved in every 
patient-practitioner interaction, and it needn&rsquo;t require woo. The most 
important elements are that the practitioner be attentive and appear to give a 
damn. Many patients will experience dramatic improvements in symptoms just by 
finding out that whatever is causing them isn&rsquo;t cancer or some other 
serious illness&mdash;which reflects an underappreciated reality about the goal 
of a diagnostic &ldquo;workup&rdquo;: not necessarily to&nbsp;determine what 
something is, but always to&nbsp;determine what it<em>isn&rsquo;t.</em> The 
refusal of some physicians and patients to accept that truth is, in my 
opinion,&nbsp;an important&nbsp;basis for a &ldquo;CAM&rdquo; subset, &ldquo;
fad diagnoses&rdquo; (perhaps a topic for another time).</p> 
<p>As a patient, I have experienced two memorable examples of what I think of 
as &ldquo;placebo effects.&rdquo; The first occurred at the age of 18 
when,&nbsp;plagued by&nbsp;adolescent angst, I visited a psychiatrist exactly 
once who told me, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re not crazy and you&rsquo;re not going to 
go crazy.&rdquo; I&nbsp;remained an&nbsp;adolescent for some time,&nbsp;but I 
sure felt a hell of a lot better. The second occurred&nbsp;many 
years&nbsp;later and was heralded not by a conversation, but by a diagnostic 
test: after a couple of months of excruciating neck pain, I had a magnetic 
resonance&nbsp;imaging (MRI) study that showed that my cervical spine was 
normal. As I read the report the pain abated, never to return to its previous 
degree of severity.</p> 
<p>I am glad that Dr. Moran has described his views on this topic as 
&ldquo;tentative positions that I am exploring.&rdquo; Such candor serves to 
maintain my view of him as our &ldquo;conscience,&rdquo; even as it&nbsp;makes 
me optimistic&nbsp;that&nbsp;we might&nbsp;dissuade him from making those 
positions permanent. </p> 
<h3>The Physician as Expert Consultant</h3> 
<p>Philosophers Clark Glymour and Douglas Stalker wrote an article 25 years 
ago for the New England Journal of Medicine&nbsp;titled &ldquo;Engineers, 
cranks, physicians, magicians.&rdquo; It was later reprinted as the first 
chapter of a book edited by the same authors,<em>Examining Holistic Medicine
</em><em>,</em> which deserves to be on the shelf of anyone interested in the 
topic. At the time the article was written, the terms &ldquo;Complementary and 
Alternative Medicine&rdquo; (&ldquo;CAM&rdquo;) and &ldquo;Evidence-Based 
Medicine&rdquo; (EBM) had yet to enter the lexicon. Other than 
that&nbsp;it&nbsp;is as timely now as it was then, and is also pertinent to 
much of the discussion here (note to Dr. Moran:&nbsp;this is no 
longer&nbsp;directed at you; I know that you&nbsp;are aware of these 
things).&nbsp;Because the article is not available online I&rsquo;ve reproduced 
several passages:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>Medicine in industrialized nations is scientific medicine. The claim 
tacitly made by American or European physicians, and tacitly relied on by their 
patients, is that their palliatives and procedures have been shown by science 
to be effective. Although the physician&rsquo;s medical practice is not itself 
science, it is based on science and on training that is supposed to teach 
physicians to apply scientific knowledge to people in a rational way.</p> 
</blockquote> 
<blockquote> 
<p>The practice of medicine in the United States and in other industrialized 
nations is a form of consultant engineering. The subjects are people rather 
than bridges, but in many respects the professions of medicine and engineering 
are alike. We expect skilled engineers to be able to learn from experience and 
to get better at building bridges, because we believe that their training has 
subjected them to a rational discipline that has made them good learners about 
such matters. Sometimes, of course, we are disappointed. It is entirely the 
same with physicians, who must apply both explicit scientific principles and 
also a great deal of tacit knowledge to the treatment of their patients. 
Medical training is supposed to make physicians good at applying scientific 
knowledge to sickness, and it is also supposed to make medical doctors good at 
acquiring through practice an abundance of tacit knowledge useful to their 
craft.</p> 
<p>There is no reason, either historically or logically, to conceive of the 
science used by physician engineers as necessarily physical science. Engineers 
need not care in principle whether the generalizations on which they rely are 
psychological, physical, or psychophysical; what they care about is that the 
generalizations be applicable and that their reliability be scientifically 
demonstrated. A great deal of what physicians learn consists of biologic and 
biochemical generalizations, broadly construed, but they also learn a 
substantial body of psychophysical generalizations which can be regarded as 
bridging the crevasse between mind and body. For example, generalizations 
concerning the effects of drugs, correlating the location of pain with other 
physical symptoms of disease, and positing the causal factors in dizziness and 
senility connect the mental with the physical and are thus useful for medical 
engineering. If physicians learn relatively fewer generalizations that are 
entirely psychological or social in nature or that posit psychological 
mechanisms for physical effects, the reason is not that such generalizations 
are alien to the &ldquo;medical model&rdquo; but that relatively few of them 
are applicable and scientifically warranted.</p> 
<p>There are alternative conceptions of the physician. Some of them play a 
dominant part in the understanding of medicine in other societies, and some 
serve to qualify the conception of the physician as engineer even in our own 
society. One such conception is that physicians are consolers. Another is that 
they are magicians who exercise occult powers to bring about healing. As 
magicians, they possess magical powers either because of the occult knowledge 
they possess or simply because of who they are&mdash;for example, because they 
stand in some special relation to gods or demons. Again, the physician may be 
understood to be someone who applies a reliable body of knowledge that is not 
warranted by science or by magic but is simply known and, so far as the 
community is concerned, always has been known. The warrant behind this 
conception of the healer is tradition and &ldquo;common knowledge.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>These distinctions are more logical than sociological, and a society may 
combine several of them in the roles it assigns to healers. A medicine man can 
combine traditional therapies with magical claims, and both with a bit of 
consolation. A physician engineer can act as consoler; nothing in either logic 
or social psychology forbids it. But certain combinations are impossible or 
extraordinarily unlikely. A physician engineer cannot honestly claim powers of 
magic or occult knowledge. The principles governing scientific reasoning and 
belief are negative as well as positive, and they imply that occult doctrines 
are not worthy of belief. Moreover, physician engineers have no immunity to 
moral or ethical constraints. On the contrary, they are by training and by 
culture enmeshed in a tradition of rational thought about the obligations and 
responsibilities of their profession.</p> 
<p>Is there another, holistic, conception of medicine distinct from those 
described above? Certainly, many people seem to think so. In 1978, a group of 
medical and osteopathic physicians formed the American Holistic Medicine 
Association, which now publishes a journal and whose meetings have been 
recognized for education purposes by the American Medical Association. Popular 
bookstores are filled with works on &ldquo;holistic medicine,&rdquo; many 
edited by medical doctors and some recommended by such political eminences as 
Edward Kennedy and George McGovern. The same shelves boast best-selling books 
on holistic medicine authored by professors at distinguished medal schools and, 
in at least one case, by a physician administrator at the National Institutes 
of Health. The therapies described and recommended in a typical book of the 
genre include biofeedback, hypnosis, psychic healing, chiropractic, tai chi, 
iridology, homeopathy, acupuncture, clairvoyant diagnosis, human auras, and 
Rolfing. One of the larger books of this kind was even subsidized by the 
National Institute of Mental Health.</p> 
<p>What ties together the diverse practices&hellip;? In part, a banal rhetoric 
about the physician as consoler;&hellip; In part, familiar and rather useless 
admonitions about not overlooking the abundance of circumstances that may 
contribute to one condition or another. Such banalities are often true and no 
doubt sometimes ignored, with disastrous consequences, but they scarcely amount 
to a distinctive conception of medicine. Holist therapies can be divided into 
those that are adaptations of traditional medical practices in other 
societies&mdash;Chinese, Navajo, and so forth&mdash;and those that were 
invented, so to speak, the week before last by some relatively successful crank.
</p> 
<p>Insofar as it extends beyond banality, the holistic medical movement 
constitutes both a deliberate attempt to substitute a magical for an 
engineering conception of the physician and an attack on scientific 
understanding and reasoning. Although the holistic movement does not contain a 
conception of medicine distinct from those we have discussed, it does contain a 
reactionary impetus to return the practice of medicine to the practice of magic 
and to replace logic and method with occultism and obfuscation.</p> 
<p>Several conceptions of &ldquo;holism&rdquo; have been developed in the 
writings of holistic practitioners and their advocates. Most of them are 
vacuous; they are banalities of orthodox medicine, or they have no medical 
content and no applicability to any possible practice of medicine; they merely 
sound nice. Some are patently false. A much-repeated and trivial thesis, and 
moreover one that is said to characterize the sense in which holistic medicine 
is&nbsp;&ldquo;holistic,&rdquo; amounts to no more than this: mental and 
physical properties are interdependent. Mental states affect physical states 
and physical states affect mental states. No one doubts it. To make such a 
claim seem somehow profound, holistic writers invariably conjoin it with a 
discussion of Cartesian dualism, insinuating that modern medicine follow 
Descartes in postulating an impassable chasm between the mind and the body. 
Modern medicine does no such thing, and could not even if it wanted to, since 
Descartes held no such view.</p> 
<p>Another doctrine said to be holistic is that one&rsquo;s state of health is 
affected by everything. Whatever this means, it has nothing to do with any 
possible practice of medicine, for no one can attend to everything. If 
physicians cannot distinguish relevant from irrelevant factors, important from 
unimportant causes, then they can do nothing. A variation of this doctrine is 
not vacuous but merely vapid: &ldquo;Fundamental to holistic medicine is the 
recognition that each state of health and disease requires a consideration of 
all contributing factors: psychological, psychosocial, environmental, and 
spiritual.&rdquo; [Pelletier 1979] This is not a new revelation about medicine. 
Insofar as such multiple factors are known and believed to be important, they 
are routinely addressed in conventional medicine practice. Patients who suffer 
from coronary heart disease may be treated with beta blockers and antiplatelet 
drugs, and they may also be advised to change their work, their diet, their 
smoking habits, their exercise habits, and their living conditions.</p> 
</blockquote> 
<p>The essay discusses assertions that &ldquo; &lsquo;all states of health and 
all disorders are considered to be psychosomatic&rsquo; [Pelletier 1977]&ldquo; 
and that &ldquo;the entire body (and psyche) can be treated or diagnosed 
through the treatment or observations of a special part of the anatomy.&rdquo; 
Because of such notions,</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>&hellip;holistic practitioners&hellip;are under no obligation, they 
believe, to reconcile their claims about therapy with what is known about the 
causal pathways of the body.</p> 
<p>The holistic practitioner sees the body in much the same way that magicians 
of old viewed the universe. The body becomes the last bastion of magic.</p> 
</blockquote> 
<p>The authors&nbsp;expose the fallacy of the&nbsp;argument that 
&ldquo;holistic medicine has not really been investigated, that funds ought to 
be made available for conducting tests of holistic practices, and that 
meanwhile we should keep our minds open about holistic techniques.&rdquo; 
Although they couldn&rsquo;t have foreseen thescientific blind spot that would 
soon&nbsp;hamper academic medicine in the form of &ldquo;evidence-based 
medicine,&rdquo;&nbsp;the authors&nbsp;portend discussions ofPrior Probability:
</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>Although it might be interesting to know more about the physiological 
pathways that are correlated with such processes as the placebo effect, this 
has nothing do with taking seriously the claims advanced by iridologists or 
zone therapists or even chiropractors. The claim to diagnose by examining the 
eye or to cure by massaging the foot is completely bogus; we know more than 
enough about the workings of the body to be reasonably certain that geometric 
features of the iris, for instance, do not provide the specific information 
about disorders that iridologists claim they do&hellip;.Of course, it is 
conceivable that the beliefs of scientific medicine are in error about one or 
another of these matters, but that is no reason for using public funds to 
investigate holistic claims. One cannot justify spending other people&rsquo;s 
money simply because one can imagine something to be true. The mere fact that 
holistic medicine is widespread and enduring is no reason to take its claims 
seriously; superstition, self-deception, stupidity, and fraud are ubiquitous 
and always have been.</p> </blockquote> 
<p>The authors refute the charge that &ldquo;the lack of evidence concerning 
the specific curative powers of holistic therapies is the result of a 
conspiracy of disinterest.&rdquo; They dispense with cultural 
relativism,&nbsp;another favorite refuge of IMC advocates, and demolish 
the&nbsp;&rdquo;differing paradigms of Thomas Kuhn&rdquo; contrivance:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>Holistic advocates repeatedly cite Kuhn and claim that holistic medicine is 
an alternative paradigm with its own standards, one that cannot be understood 
or assessed by the practitioners of orthodox medicine. If the claim were valid, 
holistic practice would have to constitute a scientific tradition, albeit one 
in competition with the tradition of orthodox medicine. However, holistic 
medicine is not a scientific tradition. It has no paradigmatic work, no 
recognized set of problems, and no shared standards for what constitutes a 
solution to those problems; it also lacks the critical exchange among its 
practitioners that is characteristic of the sciences. Cranks have been common 
throughout the history of science, as Kuhn, a distinguished historian of 
science, knew well. The work of cranks does not constitute a scientific 
revolution, and no cranks appear among Kuhn&rsquo;s many examples.</p> 
</blockquote> 
<p>Glymour and Stalker were prescient in their conclusion:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>If holistic-health advocates were content with encouraging sensible 
preventive medicine or with criticizing the economic organization of American 
medicine, we might be enthusiastic, but they are not. If the movement were 
without influence on American life, we would be indifferent, but it is not. 
Holistic medicine is a pablum of common sense and nonsense offered by cranks 
and quacks and failed pedants who share an attachment to magic and an animosity 
toward reason. Too many people seem willing to swallow the rhetoric&mdash;even 
too many medical doctors&mdash;and the results will not be benign. At times, 
physicians may find themselves in sympathy with the holistic movement, because 
some fragment of the rhetoric rings true, because of certain practices and 
attitudes they encounter in their daily work with colleagues and patients, or 
because of dissatisfaction with the economic and social organization of 
medicine. One hopes they will speak bluntly, but it does no good to join forces 
with cranks and quacks, magicians and madmen.</p> </blockquote>

<p>Dr. Moran&rsquo;s hypothetical about witch doctors struck me as 
provocative, but after further consideration, I&rsquo;m not sure it teaches us 
anything new.</p> 
<p>If an MD agreed to a tribesman&rsquo;s request for a witch doctor, and the 
witch doctor&rsquo;s role was just to assuage the tribesman&rsquo;s fears, 
isn&rsquo;t that equivalent to having the hospital chaplain stop by to comfort 
a seriously ill patient? I don&rsquo;t mean to suggest that religion is 
equivalent to shamanism, only that the MD is responding to the patient&rsquo;s 
request for psycological/spiritual/cultural support from someone the patient 
trusts. I see nothing wrong with that, even if the MD disbelieves in both 
shamanism and religion.</p> 
<p>Alternatively, if an MD called in the witch doctor on his own initiative, 
that&rsquo;s more problematic. Just as it would be problematic to ask a priest 
to visit a hospital patient who might be Jewish (or atheist).</p> 
<p>What about treatments by the witch doctor (e.g. some potion)? If the 
tribesman wants it, and if the MD judges that it&rsquo;s safe and won&rsquo;t 
interfere with the &lsquo;real&rsquo; treatments, it&rsquo;s pretty much 
analogous to a patient who wants to take homeopathy in addition to his 
&lsquo;real&rsquo; medicines. Depending on the circumstances, it may or may not 
be appropriate for the MD to tell the tribesman/patient that the 
potion/homeopathy is almost certainly worthless.</p> 
<p>What if the MD thinks the witch doctor&rsquo;s potion is potentially 
harmful? In that case, wouldn&rsquo;t he have a duty to advise against it? Just 
as he would have a duty to advise against going to a laetrile clinic. 
Ultimately, though, it&rsquo;s still the tribesman&rsquo;s/patient&rsquo;s 
decision.</p> 
<p>Finally, I&rsquo;d argue that in neither case should an MD actively solicit 
interventions that he knows to be useless, whether they be a witch 
doctor&rsquo;s potions or homeopathic remedies.</p> 
<p>I recognize that the proper ethical course won&rsquo;t always be easy or 
obvious. But contrary to my initial impression, I don&rsquo;t think the witch 
doctor example reveals anything new. The only real reason I can see for 
treating the witch doctor/tribesman situation differently is that the 
tribesman&rsquo;s knowledge may be more limited. This will certainly affect any 
efforts to advise him regarding useless or potentially harmful potions. But the 
same thing applies to &lsquo;modern&rsquo; patients. They&rsquo;ll tend to be 
more knowledgable on average than the tribesman, but it&rsquo;s a difference of 
degree, not kind.</p> </li>

<blockquote> 
<p>If an MD agreed to a tribesman&rsquo;s request for a witch doctor, and the 
witch doctor&rsquo;s role was just to assuage the tribesman&rsquo;s fears, 
isn&rsquo;t that equivalent to having the hospital chaplain stop by to comfort 
a seriously ill patient?</p> </blockquote> 
<p>Yes, it is.</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>I don&rsquo;t mean to suggest that religion is equivalent to shamanism, 
only that the MD is responding to the patient&rsquo;s request for 
psycological/spiritual/cultural support from someone the patient trusts.</p> 
</blockquote> 
<p>Actually, religion is more or less equivalent to shamanism. Shamans derive 
their influence from playing, in essence, the same role as ministers or priests 
in their society. The key is that the patient has to request it and be of the 
same faith. As you point out, you wouldn&rsquo;t call in a priest to minister 
to a Jewish patient or an atheist, nor would you call in a rabbi to minister to 
a Catholic. If the patient shares the shaman&rsquo;s religious beliefs and 
views him/her as a priest in his religion, then calling in the shaman is quite 
equivalent to calling in a priest to comfort the patient.</p> </li>

<p>Dr. A. quoted:</p> 
<p>&ldquo;the holistic medical movement constitutes both a deliberate attempt 
to substitute a magical for an engineering conception of the physical and an 
attack on scientific understanding and reasoning [...it's] a reactionary 
impetus to return the practice of medicine to the practice of magic and to 
replace logic and method with occultism and obfuscation.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>I hugely agree.</p> 
<p>I&rsquo;ve been know to say a thing or two about the irrationality of 
naturopathy &mdash; overall, what I call an &lsquo;unethical sectarian 
pseudoscience&rsquo; &mdash; which also uses the &lsquo;holistic&rsquo; label, 
and is quite a subterfuge (some new skeptical blog scribblings are here,
http://naturocrit.blogspot.com/ ). </p> 
<p>But, what I find interesting this year as regards &lsquo;such anachronistic 
irrationality&rsquo; &mdash; as relates to this specific post by Dr. A. &mdash; 
is that there is now a &lsquo;holistic partnership&rsquo;:</p> 
<p>the AANP [North American 'Federally accredited' naturopathy] has joined 
forces with the AHMA [American Holistic Medical Association] for their annual 
convention &ldquo;Embody Nature / Redefine Health&rdquo; (see

<p>Thank-you for putting in the reference to psychotherapy. I think that one 
of the down-sides to playing shaman and giving a placebo is that true 
alternatives such as psychotherapy or a good exercise program are missed and 
the person then ends up remaining tired and dragged out rather than making the 
life-style changes that they need or participating in evidence-based 
cognitive-behavioural therapy.</p> </li>

<p>In 1995 I read the following article in the NY Times.<br>
 The Experiments 
of Dr. Oz<br>
 By CHIP BROWN;<br>
 Published: July 30, 1995<br>
 It is about 
Mehmet Oz, MD, a cardiac surgeon the author says is highly regarded in his 
field at NY&rsquo;s Columbia-Presbyterian. Dr. Oz now appears frequently on 
Oprah. Oz brought &ldquo;healers&rdquo; who use a &ldquo;therapy&rdquo; similar 
to TT into the operating room to &ldquo;treat&rdquo; his patient during 
surgery. When I read this, I thought that the doctor had a lot of very 
frightened, nervous patients who he didn&rsquo;t want to deal with so he called 
in the &ldquo;healers&rdquo; to calm them for him. Oh, how I&rsquo;d love to 
read a follow up!</p> 
<p>Recently I accessed the article on the NY Times archives site and suggest 
that you do the same because it pertains to the discussion Drs. K &amp; M are 
having here.</p> 
<p>Some EXCERPTS:</p> 
<p>At Columbia-Presbyterian the presence of hands-on healers in an operating 
room is only the most dramatic example of a new willingness to venture into the 
terra incognita of healing.</p> 
<p>Controversy or none, the Rosenthal center brought a lot of doctors with an 
interest in unorthodox therapies out of the closet, Mehmet Oz among them. In 
his training and skill Oz personified the prowess of Western medical science; 
in his experience he understood its limitations. He could sew bypass grafts and 
implant new hearts, but he was hard pressed to change the habits that put his 
patients on the operating table or to grapple with the emotional and 
psychological factors that might hasten their healing. Depression, for 
instance, has emerged as one of the major risk factors in the recovery of heart 
patients after surgery.</p> 
<p>If there were new approaches that might improve the quality of life of 
cardiac patients, Oz was willing to raise some eyebrows to evaluate them and do 
what he could to nudge a major medical center in new directions. More than 
willing &mdash; he felt ethically obliged.</p> 
<p>As Oz and others point out, many benefits arise from being able to reduce 
pain without medication: patients are spared side effects like constipation and 
stomach bleeding; they feel empowered having participated in their own 
recovery; they can leave the hospital sooner.</p> 
<p>Like all medical schools, Columbia&rsquo;s is grappling with the high cost 
of specialized medical treatment. (This month the hospital announced that it 
was seeking a merger with another hospital to help ease its growing financial 
difficulties.) In part, this means putting more emphasis on preventive and 
primary-care medicine.<br>
 END EXCERPTS</p> 
<p>Three things stand out to me. First, if it can be shown that something 
works to improve the outcome of surgery, Oz will use it without regard to why 
it works. Second, Oz either believes that emotional and psychological factors 
affect the outcome of surgery or else wants to test that hypothesis, and, 
third, the med. school needs money and is looking for 
&ldquo;alternatives&rdquo; to bring it in. That means pleasing customers.</p> 
</li> 
<li> # Harriet Hall <em>on 01 Aug 2008 at 6:14 pm </em> 
<p>The book &ldquo;Hands of Life&rdquo; describes how intuitive energy healer 
Julie Motz was accepted into Dr. Oz&rsquo;s operating rooms as part of his 
cardiac surgery team.</p> 
<p>I&rsquo;m not aware that Oz has even &ldquo;tried&rdquo; to do any 
controlled studies to show whether these alleged effects are real.</p> 
<p>I lost all respect for Oz when he fell for an old carnival trick and 
suggested that John of God was doing something to stimulate the pituitary when 
he stuck forceps up a patient&rsquo;s nose. That&rsquo;s anatomically 
impossible &ndash; there&rsquo;s a layer of bone in the way.</p> 
<p>Someone needs to investigate these psychological factors, but a gullible 
believer in woo like Dr. Oz is not the one to do it.</p> </li> 
<li> # rjstan@together.net <em>on 01 Aug 2008 at 6:45 pm </em> 
<p>Dr. A, &ldquo;Those in our culture, with occasional exceptions, were not 
brought up to believe in &ldquo;CAM.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>No, but a huge % of those in our culture, perhaps the majority, were 
brought up to believe in nonsense. There is a whole segment of the media that 
has fed them that for decades. Some doctors who use CAM recognize this and try 
to use it to benefit the patient. (I am not going to get into the value or 
ethics of this here. I only wish to state it because I don&rsquo;t think it is 
accurate to use a broad brush to describe all MDs who practice CAM.)</p> 
<p>Dr. A, &ldquo;Patients are not the problem; they are, if you&rsquo;ll 
excuse the drama, the victims.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>I disagree. I think that it is the general public that has gotten 
politicians, doctors and scientific institutions to offer CAM and that it was 
the marketers in the dietary supplement industry that got the public to do that.
</p> 
<p>Dr. A, &ldquo;every pharmacy in Europe that advertises 
&ldquo;Homeopathie&rdquo; is committing fraud, plain and simple.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>They are only committing fraud if they tell people that there is evidence 
that homeo &ldquo;remedies&rdquo; work or that they contain active ingredients. 
They can explain that they contain nothing but water, alcohol or sugar till the 
cows come home, but there will still be many people who will believe that they 
work and will want to buy them. It is like stores that sell cigarettes. Unless 
they tell customers that they are safe, they aren&rsquo;t committing fraud.</p> 
<p>Dr. A, &ldquo;Point 3 also brings psychotherapy to mind.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>IMO, CAM developed because of the failure of psychotherapy or perhaps 
because it offered people high expectations and failed to deliver.</p> 
<p>Dr. A, &ldquo;There are plenty of modern 
physicians&nbsp;whose&nbsp;patients are not disposed to look elsewhere&rdquo;
</p> 
<p>If that were true, there wouldn&rsquo;t be a billion $$ supplement 
industry. People are self medicating.</p> 
<p>I am a strong believer in evidence based medicine and I have great respect 
for the authors on this site for their incredible knowledge, intelligence, 
talent and high ethical standards, but i think there is a very nasty epidemic 
out there called CAM affecting the majority of people in many industrialized 
countries. I don&rsquo;t think you understand where these people are coming 
from or speak their language. You are very rational. You are logicians. Most 
people and even many MDs are not. Until you understand the general public and 
speak their language you will not be able to educate them or do much to stop 
CAM from taking over the world. You will only be talking to each other.</p>

<p>[...] Science, Reason, Ethics, and Modern Medicine, Part 4: Is 
&ldquo;CAM&rdquo; the only alternative? -This is an interesting ethical debate 
within the medical community worth checking out. [...]</p> </li> 
<li> # rjstan@together.net <em>on 02 Aug 2008 at 7:41 am </em> 
<p>I assume that homeopathy is traditional in many European countries like 
Germany, France, Belgium and England where even the Queen is said to carry her 
little black box of homeo &ldquo;remedies&rdquo; when she travels. Peter? Ama? 
(Although I&rsquo;ve lived in Italy, Spain and German, I never remember going 
into a pharmacy in Europe.) If homeo &ldquo;remedies&rdquo; are traditional 
there, I assume the public knows the theory behind them. In the US almost no 
one heard of homeopathy until a few years ago and very few now know the 
theories behind it. Most people believe that Americans are over regulated so 
that when homeo products are sold in pharmacies and stores next to the OTCs, 
they assume they are the same when that isn&rsquo;t true. That is deceptive and 
since there is not a tradition of use here, I doubt that many in the general 
public would buy them if they knew the truth about them.</p> 
<p>If a surgeon doing a high risk operation suspects that having a wacky woman 
wave her hands over the patient during the proceedure will calm the patient and 
seriously decrease the amount of depression she experiences afterwards, 
something he suspects will improve her chances of a good outcome, and invites 
the wacky woman to proceed, is that very different than a doctor at his wits 
end with a seriously ill person trying something he believes can&rsquo;t 
possibly help, but using it because he has heard stories that it does? Is it 
very different than the surgeon who in 1984 tried very hard to talk me into 
agreeing to have a masectomy to treat stage 1 breast CA because in spite of the 
big study just published showing that a lumpectomy and radiation are just as 
effective, he couldn&rsquo;t believe it yet and wanted more studies to confirm 
that at least in his own mind?</p> 
<p>I&rsquo;m not excusing surgeons for asking a person to perform 
&ldquo;healing touch&rdquo; or anything so silly and implausible on a patient. 
All I&rsquo;m trying to do is point out that the picture is much bigger than 
&ldquo;woo&rdquo; and that the danger of snake oil is far greater than 
accepting irrational beliefs. We have to know why people are using silly 
therapies and the reasons are many. They include fraud, ignorance and 
desperation as well as a love and belief in magic and an inability to face 
reality. If you think CAM is only about woo, IMO you are very wrong, and you 
won&rsquo;t be able to do a lot to combat quackery and snake oil because very 
few people besides Skeptics will listen to you. If you don&rsquo;t care, if it 
really is woo that you want to focus on, that is your privilege, but I 
personally am concerned about the bigger picture, about nonsense being served 
up and charged for in scientific institutions as if it were supported by solid 
evidence as well as about the terrific harm snake oil does to real people. As 
far as I&rsquo;m concerned people and doctors can do what they want to 
themselves and consenting adults but they have to be honest about it. What 
bothers me is the fraud used to sell it and I think that focusing on that we 
can help a lot of people. To each his own.</p> </li>

background in cardiac surgery but none in critical thinking, is doing: 
&ldquo;return[ing] the practice of medicine to the practice of magic 
and&hellip;replac[ing] logic and method with occultism and obfuscation.&rdquo; 
If he wants to test the hypothesis that emotional and psychological factors 
affect the outcome of surgery, then he should test that hypothesis, not bring a 
ditzy magical thinker into the operating room to violate the privacy of the 
patient and to distract and embarrass the many other practitioners involved (if 
I were an anesthesiologist in such a situation, I&rsquo;d refuse if asked and

<p>But Rosemary, you yourself are an example of a patient who was a victim! By 
your own description, there was no &ldquo;dietary supplement industry&rdquo; as 
it now exists when your doctor treated you with silver. Sure, there is one now, 
and it&rsquo;s undoubtedly an important part of the problem of irrational 
medical claims, but it&rsquo;s not the only part and it&rsquo;s not the part 
that I, for one, either know much about or can do much about. I know a lot 
about the claims themselves, about how to evaluate them, and about medical 
ethics and professionalism and what it takes to maintain them in the face of 
contradicting pressures. That&rsquo;s why I write what I write; I, like every 
other activist, make the contribution that I&rsquo;m good at making.</p> 
<p>The &ldquo;general public&rdquo; is not synonymous with 
&ldquo;patients,&rdquo; even if the latter are drawn from the former, but even 
if patients are victimized by themselves, it&rsquo;s still up to an ethical 
physician to point that out.</p>

<p>No. The &ldquo;Homeopathie&rdquo; in the window is a de facto claim about 
efficacy. Nor do the stores explain anything, at least in writing, about the 
&ldquo;remedies&rdquo; containing nothing. Pharmacies selling cigarettes 
perhaps should be embarrassing to pharmacists, but at least every customer 
knows what they are. Not so with homeo.</p>

<p>A nonsequitur. There could be one person spending billions on supplements

between, but that doesn&rsquo;t refute my assertion.</p> 
<p>I agree with you that there is &ldquo;a very nasty epidemic out there

with Dr. Moran that even a little &ldquo;CAM&rdquo; is harmless. I don&rsquo;t 
agree that &ldquo;CAM&rdquo; affects the majority of people in the sense that

<p>Dr. Atwood, perhaps I sound contradictory because you see things as black 
or white and I see several shades of gray in between.</p> 
<p>Am I for or against Oz bringing a &ldquo;healer&rdquo; into the OR? If I 
were the patient, I&rsquo;d be angry as a hornet if he even suggested such a 
thing. However, I cannot judge what he did without knowing why he did it.</p> 
<p>You said, &ldquo;If he wants to test the hypothesis that emotional and 
psychological factors affect the outcome of surgery, then he should test that 
hypothesis, not bring a ditzy magical thinker into the operating room to 
violate the privacy of the patient&hellip;&rdquo;</p> 
<p>First, if the article reported correctly, the patient was very pleased with 
the &ldquo;ditzy magical thinker&rdquo;. Second, I think that if Oz is the 
talented surgeon claimed and if he enjoys doing surgery, that that is what he 
should do. I don&rsquo;t think he should be asked to do research certainly not 
on the outcomes of psychological interventions.</p> 
<p>Because many patients become the victims of quackery does not negate the 
fact that the epidemic of CAM we are now experiencing started with the general 
public and worked its way up to scientific institutions. And please remember 
that many victims of quackery were not injured by bad practitioners of 
scientific medicine. Many were injured by supplements they bought after reading 
fraudulent ads.</p> 
<p>Of course I agree that &ldquo;pleasing customers&rdquo; is not a reason to 
deceive patients. However, I also believe that to refuse to acknolwedge and 
appreciate the huge pressure put on individual practitioners and institutions 
by patients deceived by marketing geniuses indicates a failure to see a big 
aspect of the problem. It keeps you from understanding the depth of the problem 
and all the forces involved.</p> 
<p>When i speak of your broad brush, I am referring to &ldquo;woo&rdquo;. Am I 
misunderstanding what you say? Everything I hear you and several of your 
colleagues say sounds like you are horrified by woo and think that CAM = woo, 
that CAM is caused by woo and that if only all MDs were &ldquo;critical 
thinkers&rdquo; woo would vanish at least from scientific institutions. If that 
is what you think, I believe it is very simplistic and inaccurate. I think that 
in addition to irrational beliefs there are psychological, emotional and 
financial reasons why patients and MDs resort to unscientific medicine.</p> 
<p>You state, &ldquo;The &ldquo;Homeopathie&rdquo; in the window is a de facto 
claim about efficacy.&rdquo; Do you actually know this is true in the various 
European cultures Dr. Moran referred to?</p> 
<p>My point about the failure of psychotherapy is that human beings have 
emotional and psychological needs that aren&rsquo;t being met in today&rsquo;s 
society although I don&rsquo;t really know that they were ever met and I 
certainly don&rsquo;t think that we should expect medicine to meet those needs, 
but i do think we should expect practitioners of scientific medicine to realize 
that humans have emotional and psychological needs, many of which are not being 
met. I realize that that may sound contradictory to you, but it isn&rsquo;t to 
me.</p> 
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe in God and assume that most of you don&rsquo;t 
either. But surely you can understand how emotionally comforting it must be for 
people, especially terminally ill people and their loved ones, to believe they 
are going to &ldquo;heaven&rdquo; forever. I think for many people living today 
psychotherapy replaced religion but it didn&rsquo;t help many with their 
psychological and emotional needs and now many are looking to medicine to do 
that, and of course, they will be disappointed again.</p> 
<p>All the studies I&rsquo;ve seen show that a huge number of people is 
spending a huge amount of money on supplements which they believe or hope offer 
health benefits. Perhaps in the rarifed air of Aristotlian (sp?) logic one 
cannot conclude that that means that they are taking advise about medicine from 
people other than their physicians and leaving out their MDs, but I think that 
if anyone did a serious study, they would find that that is exactly what it 
indicates.</p> 
<p>If you are saying that you don&rsquo;t think that the majority of people 
are using CAM treatments, are you saying that you don&rsquo;t consider 
&ldquo;dietary supplements&rdquo; CAM? As I&rsquo;ve said repeatedly, 
supplements are the fuel that runs the entire alt. industry.</p> </li>

able to convince large numbers of people to stop using silly therapies, but 
that&rsquo;s a tall order. Much taller than trying to convince modern 
physicians to stop encouraging the use of silly therapies. Modern physicians, 
unlike people in general, have an ethical and scientific mandate to act 
rationally. From Glymour and Stalker:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>The principles governing scientific reasoning and belief are negative as 
well as positive, and they imply that occult doctrines are not worthy of 
belief. Moreover, physician engineers have no immunity to moral or ethical 
constraints. On the contrary, they are by training and by culture enmeshed in a 
tradition of rational thought about the obligations and responsibilities of 
their profession.</p> </blockquote> 
<p>Back to you, R:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>&hellip;and the reasons are many. They include fraud, ignorance and 
desperation as well as a love and belief in magic and an inability to face 
reality.</p> </blockquote> 
<p>I agree completely.</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>If you think CAM is only about woo, IMO you are very wrong, and you 
won&rsquo;t be able to do a lot to combat quackery and snake oil because very 
few people besides Skeptics will listen to you.</p> </blockquote> 
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure what you mean by this. I don&rsquo;t think that 
&ldquo;CAM&rdquo; is only about woo; I think that &ldquo;CAM&rdquo;<em>is </em>
woo.</p>

<p>If you don&rsquo;t care, if it really is woo that you want to focus on, 
that is your privilege, but I personally am concerned about the bigger picture, 
about nonsense being served up and charged for in scientific institutions as if 
it were supported by solid evidence as well as about the terrific harm snake 
oil does to real people.</p> </blockquote> 
<p>So am I, as I&rsquo;ve written countless times. It&rsquo;s the scientific 
institutions (and medical schools and governmental endorsements) that I&rsquo;m

<p>Dr. Atwood, &ldquo;But Rosemary, you yourself are an example of a patient 
who was a victim!&rdquo;</p> 
<p>I was not the victim of the MD. I was the victim of the drug company that 
published fraudulent ads. I don&rsquo;t feel I can judge the doctor with 
today&rsquo;s yardstick. He was definitely naive in that he believed the ads in 
an era when drug companies were not strictly regulated, but according to my 
definition, he was not a quack. He did not sell the drug he prescribed. My 
mother bought it at the pharmacy. The claims were not irrational. They were 
fraudulent. I was born in 1942 and have articles from med journals older than I 
am lying about the safety and efficacy of silver drugs, articles older than I 
am warning doctors about the fraud and fraudulent ads older than I am.</p> 
<p>Dr. A, &ldquo;By your own description, there was no &ldquo;dietary 
supplement industry&rdquo; as it now exists when your doctor treated you with 
silver. Sure, there is one now, and it&rsquo;s undoubtedly an important part of 
the problem of irrational medical claims, but it&rsquo;s not the only part and 
it&rsquo;s not the part that I, for one, either know much about or can do much 
about.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Supplements are not the only part of CAM but they are the common 
denominator, the fuel that runs the industry, the billion $$ money maker. 
Irrational beliefs are easy to target. False information requires a lot of 
investigation. Supplement promoters, especially botanical promoters, are often 
brilliant, rational and know some science. They cut and paste bad study after 
bad study showing efficacy and tear apart good ones showing none and laugh all 
the way to the bank which is exactly what they are paid to do, deceive people 
to make money.</p> 
<p>Far more people are concerned about and can recognize fraud than irrational 
beliefs. If you limit your exposes to irrational beliefs you will have a much 
narrower audience and much smaller impact than if you expose fraud. IMO, the 
only way that we can really have a major impact and protect the public is to 
have many people actually learn enough about supplements to recognize fraud 
when it occurs and expose it.</p> </li>

<p>Rosemary,</p> 
<p>First, excuse me for not having read your latest comment before posting my 
own. I had to write mine piecemeal, and couldn&rsquo;t look to see if you had 
answered without losing mine.</p> 
<p>It seems that your argument, distilled, is that it&rsquo;s the dietary 
supplement industry, with its advertising and its financial incentives to 
pushers, that is at the bottom of the current &ldquo;CAM&rdquo; fad. By not 
addressing that, you argue, we SBMers don&rsquo;t have a chance to make much 
difference. No?</p> 
<p>I agree that this is an important issue. It is far from the only one. There 
are numerous quackademics at prestigious medical schools and elsewhere whose 
original motivations had nothing to do with dietary supplements, although in 
some cases those became part of their &ldquo;programs&rdquo; later, for obvious 
reasons. Examples:here, here, and here. There are others who have pushed 
&ldquo;CAM&rdquo; drugs that are not &ldquo;supplements&rdquo; and that have no 
financial backing or marketing efforts by their manufacturers. A huge example, 
which is the basis for several of the most pernicious organizations of 
&ldquo;CAM&rdquo; physicians and of the most expensive and largest trial yet 
funded by the NCCAM, is discussed at lengthhere.</p> 
<p>I have already written in opposition to practitioners pushing 
&ldquo;natural remedies&rdquo;or drugs of whatever ilk. Some of us (not me, 
because I find it boring) have written in opposition to the 1994 DSHEA law, 
which as you know opened the marketing floodgates for 
&ldquo;supplements.&rdquo; It would be great if that law were repealed, and 
I&rsquo;m sure we&rsquo;d all be for it.</p> 
<p>It might even happen. If Congress is actually successful in giving the FDA 
the power to regulate tobacco(a terrible idea, in my opinion, but for reasons 
that have nothing to do with this discussion), &ldquo;supplement&rdquo; 
companies and advocates won&rsquo;t have a leg to stand on. Sure, they have 
money, but so does &ldquo;Big Tobacco.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rjstan said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think he should be asked to do research 
certainly not on the outcomes of psychological interventions. &rdquo;</p> 
<p>OK, but if he&rsquo;s not going to do research and is not using any control 
group, he has no right to make the claims he is making for the efficacy of the 
woo. In Julie Motz&rsquo;s book she says Oz credited her with the success when 
a transplanted heart started beating, saying he didn&rsquo;t know what she did 
in there, but he&rsquo;d never seen a heart come back so fast. He made Motz 
part of his team and allowed her to introduce a macrobiotic diet, acupuncture, 
hypnosis, aromatherapy, changing light from fluorescent to incandescent, and 
cleaning the floors only with natural cleansers. He allows Motz to tell 
patients they are responsible for their own illness, and she makes them act out 
the anger and relieve emotions that were going on in their life at the time 
their illness began. She tells them they are bringing treatments such as 
surgery into their lives in order to relive their traumas, including prenatal 
traumas. I simply can&rsquo;t believe all that is in the patients&rsquo; best 
interests.</p> 
<p>And it&rsquo;s not a matter of patients asking for woo; the energy healer 
is officially part of Dr. Oz&rsquo;s team: surely that influences patients. If 
you are about to have major surgery, you may acquiesce to anything you think 
the surgeon approves of.</p> </li>

<p>I think we all understand that. And like Peter, I have no objection to 
patients using unscientific treatments as long as they can give informed

supported by evidence when it really isn&rsquo;t. Or attributing its effects to

<p>Dr. Atwood, since i&rsquo;m sure if people are reading this that I am 
driving them crazy, I will try hard to make this my last comment on this topic.
</p> 
<p>You said, &ldquo;I think that &ldquo;CAM&rdquo; is woo.&rdquo; If by that 
you mean that you think that all CAM is irrational, you are wrong. Not all of 
it is. A huge part of it is fraud. I will use silver as an example. i will not 
pull files. I will do it from memory. (Some is on my webpage with citations.)
</p> 
<p>When I heard that silver was being sold as a supplement, I asked the 
salesmen how they knew it was safe and effective. Many mentioned Henry Crookes, 
MD. There were ads that made it look as if he were alive and well and working 
today. I eventually found he was writing for journals in England and selling 
&ldquo;collodial silver&rdquo; there and in the US in the early 1900s. I 
located his articles that included photos of petri dishes with silver 
supposedly killing bacteria. There were articles praising his products in the 
Lancet and the British Medical J among others by several different doctors.</p> 
<p>JAMA called old Henry a quack in 1919. I found several articles by the 
agency, the name escapes me, that preceeded the FDA. They had a column in JAMA 
reporting their investigations and warned about Henry and his buddies and their 
articles several times. Yet today&rsquo;s silver quacks are still citing the 
old quack articles.</p> 
<p>They also constantly quoted Robert O. Becker, MD and his popular books. I 
read one and it didn&rsquo;t say anything about drinking silver. Eventually, I 
located Dr. B. He is a reputable silver researcher horrified by the way silver 
quacks cite his work to promote supplements. He gave up trying to stop them. 
He&rsquo;d contact a site, they&rsquo;d remove the reference and two more sites 
would pop up using it. He had me post a disclaimer on my site.</p> 
<p>I could give you many more examples, but will limit myself to one more 
often offered as a reference by today&rsquo;s silver quacks, Robert J. Harman. 
I got a copy of his book which looks to me like a reputable textbook on colloid 
chemistry published in 1938. Hartman appears to have been a chemist at an 
Indiana university. His last chapter is on colloids in medicine. It contains 
pictures of the petri dishes that look just like those Crookes showed in his 
articles because they are. He credits the photos and the information to the 
Crookes Laboratory. Like my doctor, he believed them and never tried to verify 
their claims. The silver quacks quote p. 538 of Hartman&rsquo;s book where he 
says something like silver has been found safe enough to put into the eyes and 
nose. On the bottom of the same page, something the silver quacks never 
mention, he says that colloidal lead, another Crookes product, has been 
successfully intecjed into cancerous tumors. (I don&rsquo;t have the book 
opened and know I&rsquo;m not getting the wording correct, but you get the 
idea.)</p> 
<p>When I tried to file a complaint with the FTC, I said to the lady, 
&ldquo;They are quoting old quacks as if they were reputable researchers 
working today!&rdquo; She laughed and said, &ldquo;They all do that.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>This is fraud. It is lying to make a buck. And the good quacks could easily 
fool the best critical thinker if he didn&rsquo;t begin by checking the facts, 
a task that can get overwhelming very quickly and which is the main reason why 
the person making the claim has to substantiate it.</p> </li> 
<li> # Kimball Atwood <em>on 02 Aug 2008 at 10:37 pm </em> 
<p>Rosemary,</p> 
<p>Once again we are cross-posting, but no matter. Woo and fraud are not 
mutually exclusive. Almost all &ldquo;dietary supplement&rdquo; marketing 
claims are woo, in that they are not backed by anything close to reasonable 
evidence. Their sales are thus fraudulent. Colloidal silver, by no stretch of 
the imagination a dietary supplement, is also both woo and fraud. Perhaps you 
noticed that a few weeks ago I cited the naturopath&rsquo;s bible, the Textbook 
of Natural Medicine (2nd edition, Pizzorno and Murray Eds, Edinburgh, Churchill 
Livingstone, 1999) for having plugged colloidal silver, administered orally, as 
a treatment for opportunistic infections in HIV+ patients (p. 1292). The basis 
for that recommendation was a single report of silver used as a preservative.
</p> 
<p>That recommendation is woo, and its fulfillment would be fraud.</p>

<li> # Jules <em>on 03 Aug 2008 at 2:04 am </em> 
<p>I have to wonder if:</p> 
<p>&ldquo;introduc[ing] a macrobiotic diet, acupuncture, hypnosis, 
aromatherapy, channging light from fluorescent to incandescent, and cleaning 
the floors of with only natural cleansers&rdquo;</p> 
<p>is that bad. I mean, honestly? If you found that washing soda and water 
worked just as well as your average floor cleaner with seventeen chemicals (and 
it does&ndash;I use it on our floors), is it really that terrible to change? If 
having a room smell of lavender and bergamot oil makes you calm (smell is very 
closely tied to emotion), wouldn&rsquo;t it be better than having you stressed 
out by the hospital environment? And light can affect a person&rsquo;s mood, 
too.</p> 
<p>The rest of the stuff (the psychobabble) is pure crap. As much as I hate 
playing the &ldquo;you&rsquo;re sick because society made you sick&rdquo; card, 
I would never tell someone that they&rsquo;re sick because they somehow brought 
it upon themselves. They probably realize it already, and that&rsquo;s just not 
going to help. And &ldquo;prenatal trauma&rdquo;? I subscribe to a lot of CAM 
stuff*, admittedly, but that&rsquo;s going too far.</p> 
<p>*The CAM stuff I subscribe to is that which falls under the range of 
&ldquo;scientifically possible, though not yet proven&rdquo;. They are, mostly, 
the herbal medications and dietary recommendations that I&rsquo;ve tried on 
myself and found effective, as well as yoga. I use honey instead of neosporin 
on my cuts, and eat a largely vegetarian diet&ndash;not because I think 
it&rsquo;s healthier (which I do), but because I just happen to not like the 
taste of meat. Aromatherapy&ndash;okay, smelling nice things does make one 
happy, but beyond that I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s actually effective as 
medicine.</p> 
<p>On the other hand, being happy is a MAJOR component of 
recovery&ndash;I&rsquo;ve lapsed on my reading on how the nervous system 
affects the immune system, but as of 2005 (the last year that I followed this 
closely) the studies seemed to to be pointing towards stress actually lowering 
immune cell counts and other objective measurements of immune function. The 
science seems to be indicating that if we let patients have their way with 
otherwise harmless things like crystals and incense (obviously not for an 
asthmatic!) then they might just recover faster. I don&rsquo;t know if 
there&rsquo;s any way to make a rule on how far we should go.</p> </li>

<p>Am I really the only one who sees a magnitude of difference between the 
recommendation of the use of a supplement based on the single report of its use 
as a preservative and the publication of &ldquo;lab&rdquo; reports showing in 
vitro activity when there was no such activity? Am I the only one who sees how 
almost all MDs and educated laypeople would laugh at the first and conclude 
that the NDs were idiots but could possibly be fooled by the second?</p> 
<p>Am I the only one who thinks it is criminal, not irrational, to claim your 
product contains an element like silver, something so easy to know for sure, 
when it doesn&rsquo;t?</p> 
<p>Am I really the only one who sees a huge difference between lying to make 
money, even when you know that your lie can result in harming people, and 
promoting nonsense that you actually truly believe in like &ldquo;energy 
medicine&rdquo; or prayer for the prevention and cure of disease?</p> 
<p>Am I the only one who sees a difference in the role of a prosecutor and a 
scientist, the FTC and the FDA?</p> 
<p>Am I the only one who thinks that when exposing quackery you should give a 
lot more weight and spend a lot more time and effort on fraudulent, made up, 
deliberately invented reports of benefits than on things as utterly silly as 
with wacky people, often very nice wacky people telling others to drink 
something to cure a disease like AIDS because there is one study that showed it 
worked as a preservative, or because the fairies told you that it worked or 
maybe the stars indicate that it does?</p> 
<p>Sorry. I know I promised to drop the subject. I&rsquo;ll try again, but 
before I do&hellip;</p> 
<p>Harriet, if what you claim Motz wrote is true, my opinions of Oz would be 
very different. I would not give him the benefit of the doubt. I don&rsquo;t 
have the time to investigate. If I did, I&rsquo;d get a copy of Motz&rsquo;s 
book and contact Columbia to see if her statements are true. I would also try 
hard to find out what Oz is doing there now and what he has done since the 
article I cited was published in 1995.</p> 
<p>What I&rsquo;m trying unsuccessfully to bring out is that I feel completely 
disconnected with the majority of you because of your tone. I get the 
impression you weigh all silly, nonsense equally. I do not. I laugh at most of 
it, but I don&rsquo;t laugh at fraud. Fraud infuriates me and I am not going to 
split hairs with definitions of fraud and irrational beliefs. When discussing 
quackery, I hate the Skeptic&rsquo;s use of the word woo because I think that 
the people you should be trying to reach don&rsquo;t understand it and when 
they do they will think you are talking down your noses at them. I am talking 
about feelings and perceptions here, things I get the impression Skeptics have 
difficulty dealing with, things I think have to be used to communicate with the 
general public.</p> </li>

<p>Rosemary,</p> 
<p>&ldquo;Woo&rdquo; means &ldquo;bullshit.&rdquo; I use &ldquo;woo&rdquo; as 
a shorthand for implausible medical claims (IMC). Perhaps I should be more 
formal. My writing is aimed not at every person who dabbles in 
&ldquo;supplements,&rdquo; but at People Who Should Know Better, such as some 
physicians, some medical school deans and other administrators, some scientists 
at the NIH, and some legislators. If they feel talked down to (assuming any of 
them even reads this stuff), that&rsquo;s fine with me. They know what we mean 
when we write &ldquo;woo,&rdquo; and they ought to feel the sting of the 
insult. It is they who have embarrassed science and medicine, and who have 
violated the public trust.</p> 
<p>The selling of woo, whether for financial gain or not, is fraud. The 
intentions of the seller are irrelevant and often unknowable.</p>

<p>We have reached that point where the urge to respond to every comment can 
expand verbiage exponentially and tiresomely. I will try instead to move 
discussion on.</p> 
<p>The standard healthfraud position is that even if CAM may sometimes be 
helpful to people, it is a bad thing regarding which there can be no compromise.
</p> 
<p>It is a bad thing because, to quote KA, &ldquo;implausible claims being 
promoted, tacitly or otherwise&rdquo; leads to &rdquo; unnecessary expense, a 
patient later feeling betrayed by her physician when the treatment 
doesn&rsquo;t work or the &ldquo;placebo effect&rdquo; wears off and she 
realizes that&nbsp;it was&nbsp;only a &ldquo;pretend medicine&rdquo; all along, 
other patients&nbsp;or physicians concluding that the treatments have validity 
(and possibly being convinced to forgo rational treatment), people in general 
losing&nbsp;confidence in&nbsp;modern medicine when it appears that many 
physicians can&rsquo;t distinguish between the rational and the bogus, wasted 
research funds, human subjects unnecessarily duped and endangered, a befuddled 
media a befuddled public befuddled leglislators endorsing quacks to a befuddled 
public.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Superficially this is a powerful line of argument, because we can fairly 
easily find instances where such predictions are fulfilled. Yet I have 
suggested that healthfrauders routinely exaggerate the risks of CAM, that some 
potential dangers are not realized much in practice, and it again needs to be 
said that the medical risks depend very much upon the specific 
&ldquo;quack&rdquo; claim. Also, some of these outcomes, if as truly awful as 
implied, may be thought of as mainly exposing a puzzling lack of reach for more 
rational voices. This is the very reason why I have an interest in examining 
the kind of messages we are putting out.</p> 
<p>And there is considerable evidence against some of the above. Surveys 
routinely show that the majority of CAM-using patients express great 
satisfaction with them. Despite this, nearly all also use conventional methods, 
and are satisfied with that. Even in this heyday of CAM, very few of the public 
use CAM exclusively.</p> 
<p>The Scots are an interesting case study. They don&rsquo;t seem to be vastly 
worse off health-wise or science-wise, or even exceptionally befuddled, yet 50% 
of their doctors prescribe homeopathic remedies and a further 10% use herbs.
http://www.scienceagogo.com/news/20061027232826data_trunc_sys.shtml .</p> 
<p>What this adds up to is that the public may not be (generally) as 
indiscriminate in their use of alternative methods and as in need of protection 
from unscientific concepts as we healthfrauders like to think. Maybe we 
skeptics encounter a disproportionate amount of the dangerous and nutty 
extremes of &ldquo;alternative&rdquo; medicine because we go looking for it and 
we hang about on forums that gather it. We are also fairly obviously more 
deeply offended by it than most, which can lead to confirmation bias.</p> 
<p>Which brings me to this: in science-based medicine we are quite accustomed 
to evaluating medical options in terms of benefits vs risks. We normally try to 
quantify them so that we can reach a reasonable balance. An example is studies 
designed to determine the optimum dose of a noxious chemotherapeutic agent, so 
that cancer remissions are produced at acceptable risk. These days such studies 
even often include quality-adjusted life year (QALY) measurements so that all 
aspects of patient life can bear upon a precise, measurement-based, final 
judgment.</p> 
<p>That&rsquo;s how we normally operate. Not so, apparently, when it comes to 
CAM.. In relation to that we adopt the meanest, least flexible possible 
position, even while lacking any clear evidence-based handle on the medical or 
psychosocial benefits or the social functions of unconventional and folk 
medical activity, or their risks. All we know, having completely dismissed all 
the anecdotal evidence, is that they usually don&rsquo;t work obviously better 
than placebo when put to the test in the banal environment of the typical 
controlled trial. We don&rsquo;t care that they may be being used mainly when 
there is no entirely satisfactory evidence-based treatments for the complaint, 
nor that some of the methods may simply have not yet been subjected to 
sufficient study to be quite sure whether they have intrinsic medical activity 
or not. It&rsquo;s all one, if it is seen to be &ldquo;alternative&rdquo;.</p> 
<p>Is the resort to ethical argument about the use of placebo medicines a lazy 
way of justifying such a globally rigid approach? The ethical card has some 
force, even when set against other primary ethical obligations of doctors 
towards their patients, but in reality it can only apply to that select few who 
have a clear enough grasp of the scientific evidence to be as certain as can be 
that any given CAM treatment IS a placebo. But Healthfraud has to also deal 
with what a lot of other practitioners think and what our patients are often 
trying out on their own initiative. It is a waste of time talking ethics to 
those who don&rsquo;t share quite the same scientific convictions, and that 
applies to almost everyone.</p> 
<p>KA seems to help my argument with personal medical experiences that are 
reminiscent of some of stories of &ldquo;alternative&rdquo; testimonial. I was 
quite struck by them, for I have had very similar personal experiences and 
observed them in many patients. They illustrate how there can be a complete 
disconnection between the benefits of medical interactions and their scientific 
content, and, indeed. any treatment content .</p> 
<p>We have no basis on which to assume that similar benefits are not regularly 
occurring within CAM, especially when a lot of people are telling us so. In 
fact, KA elsewhere is arguing the reverse, that while CAM may be offering 
placebo and other non-specific medical benefits these can equally well occur 
within the 5-15 minute hurly-burly of the typical present day medical practice, 
I am sure they can, with good doctors, but I would love to be quite sure about 
the &ldquo;equally&rdquo;. Depending on the condition, and with as much 
reluctance and regret as anyone here, my money would be on the practitioner who 
is not hamstrung by what science says, and in consequence has a confident 
explanation for everything and never runs out of remedies. Sure, some of his 
clients may eventually realize that he is actually a nutcase, but even most of 
those will probably find ways in which they think he has helped them.</p> 
<p>The reason I am being a bit stubborn about these matters is that I have 
what is as yet merely a vague inkling that they are important &mdash; that they 
may, despite initial appearances, help rather than damage our purposes.</p> 
<p>Those who we might wish to influence in various ways may not have 
sufficient familiarity with science and medicine to be able to articulate the 
line of argument I am developing (it is difficult enough for me and I know I 
have a long haul ahead of me even if I am entirely right), but one of the 
reasons for our distressing inability to have the influence we desire may well 
be that people of ordinary intelligence and experience can nevertheless almost 
instinctively sense the weaknesses and exaggerations in some of our habitual 
arguments. They switch off. We may be able to do better with a change of tack 
if that that might actually be more in touch with medical realities.</p> 
<p>Be reassured that looking at CAM methods in strict cost/risk/benefit terms 
will definitely not change most of our judgments concerning CAM. The main 
difference would be in the emphasis of argument and some of the rhetoric. We 
would still be able to describe Hulda Clark as a dangerous and severely deluded 
cancer quack, or, if you prefer, an unspeakable criminal fraud.</p> </li>

<p>While I appreciate this thoughtful discussion (and the website in general), 
I must take issue with the adjective &ldquo;primitive&rdquo; as used to 
describe a hypothetical patient with shamanistic beliefs. I believe this word 
was intended to describe a person not educated in &lsquo;Western&rsquo; science 
or medicine, and the challenges involved in communicating with such a person 
might certainly be daunting. However, many shamanistic cultures have incredibly 
complex social networks and family structures (for example) that are by no 
means &lsquo;primitive&rsquo;. Please find a different, less perjorative word 
to describe other cultures!</p> </li> 
<li> # pmoran <em>on 05 Aug 2008 at 5:21 pm </em> 
<p>I&rsquo;ll try and find a better word than &ldquo;primitive&rdquo; but just 
about any word I can think of seems likely to be regarded as pejorative by 
those who see much to prize in the medical beliefs of ancient cultures.</p> 
<p>While on this subject, why do you use the word &ldquo;Western&rdquo; to 
distinguish science-and-technology-based medicine from that built upon religion 
or old superstitions? That expression clearly originated as an attempt to bring 
an extremely effective approach to medicine down to the same level as a pack of 
others that have been tried throughout the history of mankind.</p> </li> 
<li> # l_s_olabisi <em>on 06 Aug 2008 at 3:20 pm </em> 
<p>For Dr. Moran and others, let me clarify my remark. I was objecting to the 
use of the term &lsquo;primitive&rsquo; to refer to a *person* (the 
hypothetical tribesman, in this case), rather than to a belief. I suppose that 
describing someone&rsquo;s lack of knowledge of science-based medicine, or 
belief in shamanism, as &lsquo;primitive&rsquo; might be acceptable, although I 
still think a better choice of words might be &lsquo;non-scientific belief 
system&rsquo; or some such, as clunky as that is. I hope you&rsquo;ll agree 
with me that describing a person as &lsquo;primitive&rsquo; (or 
&lsquo;advanced&rsquo;, for that matter) is not a medical or scientific 
judgment, but a value judgment.<br>
 I agree that describing science-based 
medicine as &lsquo;Western&rsquo; was poor phrasing; it was force of habit on 
my part (although I was unaware that others have used this phrase to denigrate 
the scientific approach to medicine).</p> </li> 
<li> # rjstan@together.net <em>on 06 Aug 2008 at 7:28 pm </em> 
<p>How about pre-scientific medicine? If that is too clumsy, I have no problem 
with primitive medicine. The reason is that it really doesn&rsquo;t 
discriminate if you remember that till not much more than 100 years ago 
everyone including all the ancestors of everyone living today used primitive or 
pre-scientific medicine and crude non-standardized remedies, some of which were 
utterly useless, some dangerous and some just very unreliable.</p> 
<p>Presently, scientific medicine is used by all major and probably most minor 
cultures. While it may have started in Europe, the benefits of scientific 
medicine were quickly realized by people all over the world. I suspect that if 
you look at the names of the researchers in most major scientific institutions 
and journals, you will find that a great many come from non-western cultures.
</p> 
<p>I use the term &ldquo;unscientific medicine&rdquo; for what is presently 
often called alternative, holistic, natural, integrative or complementary. 
Ironically enough unscientific medicine originated or at least entered its 
Golden Age in Europe and English speaking countries although proponents of 
unscientific medicine sometimes seem to like to think that it is a 
reincarnation of primitive medicine. IMO, it is more like a belief in the myth 
of the &ldquo;good old days&rdquo; when everything was simple and wonderful.</p>
<p>Proponents of unscientific medicine often erroneously claim that scientific 
medicine is based on a system of cultural beliefs held by arrogant, nasty, 
prejudiced, Euro-centric, white men who favor white coats, ties and 
stethoscopes. To help convey that picture to the general public they sometimes 
call scientific medicine Western medicine. IMO, claiming that scientific 
medicine is the sole province of white males and the West is about as 
prejudiced as you can get since it implies that the rest of us are too dumb to 
recognize and embrace the great benefits scientific medicine has offered the 
world and the great promise it still offers it.</p> </li>

<p>Dr Ben Goldacre&rsquo;s placebo series on BBC Radio 4, part 2 and part 1 
touched on this issue but didn&rsquo;t explore it. Many of the commenters 
enthused about the possibilities of placebo but demurred at the ethics of using 
it. Plus, there was the usual strand that considered whether the placebo 
response of CAM might justify its use if it might be implemented in an ethical 
manner. There was no discussion as to whether this might be a gateway for 
introducing an acceptance of &lsquo;magic&rsquo; or woo in medicine, and how we 
might establish the firm boundaries around when it might be appropriate or not.
