<h1>Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine</h1> 
<p>Core De Vie also offers acupuncture, Shiatsu Massage, and more.&nbsp; 
Acupuncture, Tui Na Medical Massage,Shiatsu Massage, and Chinese herbal 
medicine are recognized forms of medical treatment. They are overseen by the 
Massachusetts Board of Medicine and are becoming widely accepted in the US. 
Many health insurance plans now cover these practices. </p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The National Institute of Health has confirmed that acupuncture is 
effective in treating a broad range of ailments from arthritis pain and 
migraine headache to fertility and menopause concerns.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Acupuncture, Tui Na, and Chinese herbal medicine promote natural 
healing.&nbsp; They adjust and stimulate&nbsp; the body's immune system.&nbsp; 
Oriental Medicine is a complete system of health care and can address many 
health concerns including:&nbsp; back and neck pain, arthritis pain,migraine

<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Tui Na is a style of massage originating in China which utilizes the 
acupuncture points and the meridian system in the body to eliminate pain, 
realign joints and muscles, nourish the organ system and increase the energy 
flow within the body to create overall health and balance.&nbsp; Click to learn

<h2><strong>Women&rsquo;s Health Acupuncture Program</strong></h2> 
<p>Acupuncture, Tui Na and Chinese herbal medicine offer many benefits to 
women as they transition through the various stages of their lives. Core De 
Vie&rsquo;s Acupuncture and Asian Medicine program empowers and supports women 
in recognizing their innate healing abilities while honoring their bodies, 
minds, and spirits.</p> 
<h3><br>
</h3> 
<h3><strong>Menopause </strong>can be a bumpy ride, complete with hot flashes, 
sleep disturbances and mood swings. Many women &ldquo;just feel off&rdquo; as 
they transition. Bring your body back into balance with a series of customized 
treatments and feel your best self again.</h3> 
<h3><br>
</h3> 
<h3><strong>Fertility concerns </strong>have become a major concern for many 
women and couples. Acupuncture is widely accepted by the western medical 
community in aiding in conception. ManyIVF centers now encourage patients to 
receive acupuncture treatments to increase their chances at a healthy 
pregnancy. Clinically, we have seen acupuncture help with pregnancy after 
rounds of IVF have failed. Acupuncture is a great place to start if you would 
prefer to try a less invasive approach or can be used in combination with 
western fertility treatments. Seeing both partners increases success, as Asian 
Medicine also affects male fertility factors. </h3> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Menstruation </strong>should occur regularly without pain or other 
complications. If you suffer from amenorrhea (lack of periods), dysmenorrhea 
(painful periods), irregular periods,PMS or Polycystic Ovary Syndrome, we can 
help regulate your cycle and allow you to get on with your life.&nbsp; The 
Transitions Acupuncture Program may begin with bi-weekly to weekly visits, 
based on your state of health. Most patients can expect to see marked results 
within 5-10 visits.</p>

<h3><strong>Healthy Pregnancy, Healthy Birth Acupuncture Program</strong></h3> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Pregnancy and Post partum care, including labor induction: Oriental 
medicine offers an ideal, drug-free approach to a multitude of issues that can 
arise during pregnancy. It effectively alleviates common issues such as nausea, 
hip pain, and back pain, while improving wellness and preventing other 
conditions from becoming more serious. Acupuncture and Tui Na are helpful to 
induce labor and also relieve pain during labor. Herbs and acupuncture promote 
lactation and a healthy recovery from the labor process. Recent studies show 
that regular acupuncture treatments provide for an easier labor and delivery. 
Your practitioner will evaluate your case and create an acupuncture treatment 
plan specific to your needs.</p>

<h3><strong>Cancer Care Acupuncture Program</strong></h3> 
<p>A cancer diagnosis has lasting impacts on patients and loved ones. 
Acupuncture holds a unique place in complementary cancer care in its ability to 
help lessen physical pain and treatment-induced side effects, while easing 
anxiety and stress. Acupuncture treatments are not only compatible with 
standard western medical interventions, but can also help patients better 
tolerate their western treatment plans. Research shows that acupuncture 
treatments can:</p> 
<p>&middot; improve post-op wound healing</p> 
<p>&middot; reduce side effects, such as hot flashes and nausea</p> 
<p>&middot; reduce the need for pain medications</p> 
<p>&middot; promote deep relaxation</p> 
<p>&middot; improve clinical outcomes</p>

<h3>What to Expect</h3> 
<p>First and foremost, Acupuncture is considered a medical treatment. The 
practitioner will meet with you and gather information about your case. 
Treatment will be based on the discussion and answers that are provided in the 
first session.&nbsp; Your practitioner will create a treatment plan to address 
your needs and make recommendations so you can effectively reach your health 
goals.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The needles used for acupuncture are hair thin.&nbsp; Most people don't 
feel anything more than a slight pressure. The FDA sets the guidelines for the 
instruments and each needle is sterile, individually packed, and used only 
once. Many people rest deeply during their treatments and leave feeling 
peaceful and centered.</p>
