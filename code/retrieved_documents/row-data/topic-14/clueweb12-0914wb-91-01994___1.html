<h3>Description</h3> 
<p>The field of pain research is rapidly expanding in both human and 
veterinary medicine, and has helped increase our understanding of acupuncture. 
However, many are still highly sceptical about the use of acupuncture and 
prefer for it to remain far from orthodox veterinary practice.<br>
<br>
 This 
book seeks to challenge common misgivings by showing how veterinary acupuncture 
works (for small and large animals), and why it should be established as an 
orthodox form of treatment.<br>
<br>
 Written from a Western approach, rather 
than a traditional Chinese Medicine approach, it explains the background and 
history of acupuncture and includes key information on safety aspects, 
understanding pain and how acupuncture can help, practical aspects such as 
types of needles and methods of restraint, and related techniques.<br>
<br>
 
Not intended as a techniques manual, this book is a preparatory text for those 
considering taking an acupuncture course and those wishing to gain a solid 
understanding of the subject.</p>
