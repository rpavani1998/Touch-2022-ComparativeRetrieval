<h1>Gram's Recipe Box: Molasses Crinkles</h1>  December18 2008 
&ldquo;Co-o-o-o-o-o-kie!!&rdquo;... I can&rsquo;t help but hear the voice of my 
favorite Muppet  character in my head around this time of year when the baking 
pans come out and every available space (including chairs, mantels and ironing 
boards) is made into an impromptu board for cooling cookies, cakes or bread.<br>
<br>This year especially most of our gifts for family and friends is going to 
come from the kitchen &mdash; economize, economize! Some recipes are perennial 
favorites, and are stored in a folder cleverly labelled &ldquo;Holiday 
Recipes&rdquo; in my filing cabinet (yes, they&rsquo;re actually on paper!). 
Others are new, or as this year, newly-found old favorites.<br>
<br>
<br>
An 
example of the latter are these Molasses Cookies, which came from a recipe I 
got from T&rsquo;s grandmother over Thanksgiving weekend. Actually, Grandma 
Steff lent me one of her recipe boxes so I could scan in all her recipes! If 
you&rsquo;ve followed this site at all, you know this was a gift of gold as far 
as I&rsquo;m concerned. I couldn&rsquo;t wait to try something from her 
collection, and the molasses cookies are the first. I borrowed the idea of 
adding raw, or turbinado, sugar to the tops from other molasses cookie recipes 
&mdash; it adds a little holiday sparkle.<br>
<br>
Tomorrow is Grandma 
Stephanie&rsquo;s birthday, so we&rsquo;ll have to send her some of these to 
help her celebrate her day.<br>
<br>
<br>
This platter of Molasses Crinkles, 
Dark Chocolate Biscotti, Pecan Crescents and Almond-Anise Biscotti is going to 
join the party at Food Blogga&rsquo;s  &ldquo;Eat Christmas Cookies&rdquo; 
event. She&rsquo;s accepting entries until the 21st, but there are already a  
wealth of recipes with photos  on the site if you need some inspiration for 
this weekend&rsquo;s blast of holiday baking. And if that&rsquo;s not enough to 
get you going, all cookie lovers who submit an entry are eligible to win a 
cookie field guide. <em>A party with door prizes &mdash; how can you pass up an 
invitation like that?!</em> <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
GRAM&rsquo;S GINGER 
MOLASSES COOKIES<br>
(In Gram&rsquo;s files, these are labelled 
&ldquo;Christmas Cookies&rdquo;)<br>
Makes 4-6 dozen cookies, depending on size
<br> <em>Dough requires chilling for 2 or more hours before baking</em> <br>

<br>1 cup shortening (used butter)<br>
1 cup sugar (used raw sugar)<br>
1 cup 
molasses (used blackstrap)<br>
1 egg, beaten<br>
1 tsp. baking soda dissolved 
in 1/2 cup hot water<br>
5 cups flour<br>
1 tsp salt<br>
1/2 tsp cloves<br>
1 
tsp nutmeg<br>
1 tsp cinnamon<br>
1 tsp ground ginger<br>
<br>
Cream 
shortening, then add sugar gradually, then molasses and beaten egg. Add 
dissolved baking soda to mixture.<br>
<br>
Sift together flour, salt and 
spices. Add to creamed mixture and blend thoroughly. Chill in refrigerator for 
at least 2 hours.<br>
<br>
Preheat oven to 350F.<br>
<br>
Here is where I 
diverge from Gram&rsquo;s directions. She rolls out the dough and cuts out 
shapes. I made 1&rdquo; balls, laid them on an ungreased cookie sheet, 
flattened them with the bottom of a drinking glass, and sprinkled raw sugar on 
top. Some recipes say to dip the balls in sugar then flatten with a glass, but 
I discovered after the first batch that the sugar crystals flatten out too much 
and don&rsquo;t look as attractive.<br>
<br>
If making cut-outs, Gram 
recommends baking for 8-10 minutes. For the thicker cookie crinkles, bake for 
13-15 minutes.<br>
<br>
Cool on sheet for a moment, then remove to wire racks 
to cool completely.<br>

<p><br>
</p> 
<p>These are equally great with your morning coffee, Gl&uuml;hwein, or with a 
warm apple cider.<br>
<br>
Happy Baking!<br>

<h1>Reiki ... Re-Gifted?</h1>  December17 2008 I can&rsquo;t tell you how much 
I&rsquo;ve enjoyed making friends and hearing from the many souls who have 
stopped by this site, even if only once, to share a comment or send an email. 
Your wisdom, your thoughtfulness, your many kindnesses, and of course your 
wonderful recipes and stories have enriched and expanded my world in ways I 
could not have dreamed when I began this site last fall. You have invited me 
into your lives, shared your joys and heartache, and have both challenged and 
listened. Each of you has left your mark, and I am the richer for it.<br>
<br>

Last year at this time I offered to any and all who visit this site the gift of 
Reiki healing at the start of the new year. The idea was to give us all a 
chance to start the year with a hope for peace and healing for ourselves and 
for this fragile world we all share. On the one hand, it&rsquo;s hard to 
believe that the year is now almost ended. On the other, so much has happened 
and changed in our world &mdash; and so quickly &mdash; that both anxiety and 
hope seem to vie for pole position in our hearts. ( <em>Or is that just me?</em>
)<br>
<br>
Is it considered &ldquo;re-gifting&rdquo; if you give the same gift 
you gave the year before? Well, even if it is, recycling is supposed to be 
trendy this year &mdash; so whether you consider this &ldquo;Reiki 
Re-gifted&rdquo; or &ldquo;Reiki Redux,&rdquo; I hope you will accept another 
gift for Reiki healing on New Year&rsquo;s Eve. For me, this is an exercise in 
gratitude for the many blessings both bitter and sweet that have visited our 
family this year.<br>
<br>
If you would like to join in, please leave the 
following information in the Conversation/Comment section below:<br>
<br>
1. 
Your first and last name (Only your first name will appear in the comment)<br>

2. Where you will be on December 31, 2008, at 0900 GMT/UTC (0400, Eastern 
Standard Time) &mdash; if you will be vacationing or visiting somewhere other 
than your hometown at that hour, that&rsquo;s what I need to send your gift to 
the right place!<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<h3>What is Reiki?</h3>  In short, Reiki is a form of energy healing developed 
in Japan. &ldquo;Rei&rdquo; (pronounced RAY) means &ldquo;universal.&rdquo; 
&ldquo;Ki&rdquo; (pronounced KEE) is the same as the Chinese &ldquo;Qi&rdquo; 
(CHEE), which means &ldquo;life energy or life force.&rdquo; Reiki allows the 
movement of healing energy to situations and persons in need of it. Simple as 
that. Reiki practitioners who have been initiated into the first degree will do 
healing with persons they are in direct contact with. Second degree 
practitioners can practice Reiki at a distance.<br>
<br>

<h3>What does Reiki feel like?</h3>  People I&rsquo;ve worked with describe it 
as a warm heat that is very relaxing. That is usually how I experience it, too, 
when I receive Reiki, but I have also felt cool pulsating waves from certain 
Reiki practitioners. Some people will not feel a physical sensation like heat, 
but may experience a sense of well-being and lightness in their mood; others, a 
lessening of their physical complaint (an asthmatic person described feeling a 
puff of air filling her lungs).<br>
<br>

<h3>What do you have to do?</h3>  Nothing, really, except to keep your heart 
open to the possibilities that will present themselves to forgive yourself or 
those around you, or to extend a blatant act of kindness to a stranger. Oh, and 
smile. Smile in the mirror. Then carry your smile out the door.<br>
<br>

<h1>&quot;Rim of Fire&quot; Paella </h1>  December16 2008 
<p><br>
</p> 
<p>Anyone who has lived on the West Coast of the Americas, the eastern shores 
of Asia and Australia/New Zealand, Indonesia, and Guam will know the term 
&ldquo;Rim of Fire&rdquo; to describe thechain of volcanoes that bubble beneath 
the surface of the Pacific Ocean&rsquo;s edges. This subterranean activity 
sometimes finds its way to the surface in places like Kilauea on Hawaii Island, 
Ubinas in Peru, Mt. St. Helens on the U.S. West Coast, and Pinatubo in the 
Philippines. Other times its power is more felt than seen, except in its 
aftermath, as in the frequent earthquakes that trouble all areas of the Pacific.
<br><br>
This dish was designed to &ldquo;shake up&rdquo; the palate and 
imagination with a Pacific take on an Iberian classic, the lovely paella. In 
our version, carnaroli &mdash; an Italian rice variety used for risotto &mdash; 
is simmered with a saffron sofrito spiked with sake, then studded with Manila 
clams, Hawaiian-style Portuguese sausage,Kauai shrimp, and edamame for Pacific 
flair. If we had hadabalone from the Big Island, we would have put those in 
too! Red and yellow pepper strips add color and sweetness, and a squeeze of 
tangy calamansi at the end brings this dish firmly into the Pacific rim. This 
was made early last summer when we were still on Oahu and all these wonderful 
ingredients were still our &ldquo;local.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Now the challenge will 
be to make a new local version with foods from this corner of the world.<br>

<br></p> <br>
<br>
&ldquo;RIM OF FIRE&rdquo; PAELLA <br>
Serves 4 persons <br>

<br>1/2 of one Hawaiian Portuguese sausage <br>
1 TBL+ 2 TBL + 1 TBL olive oil 
<br>1 Cornish game hen, cut into serving pieces <br>
sea salt and ground black 
pepper<br>
6-8 cups vegetable or chicken broth (amount will depend on type of 
rice used, carnaroli will need more liquid)<br>
1 small onion, diced <br>
2 
cloves garlic, minced<br>
1/2 cup seeded, diced tomato (about 1 large tomato) 
<br>small handful fresh cilantro sprigs, washed, dried and minced <br>
pinch of 
saffron, soaked in warm water<br>
1/2 lb. carnaroli or arborio rice <br>
1/2 
cup (120 ml) Japanese sake or Okinawan awamori<br>
<br>
1 lb. (455g) Manila 
clams, scrubbed and cleaned<br>
1/2 lb. (225g) sweet Kauai shrimp, peeled and 
deveined<br>
1/2 red bell pepper, seeds removed and cut into thin strips <br>
1 
cup (150g) shelled edamame (fresh green soy beans)<br>
<br>
Calamansi limes, 
for garnish and seasoning<br>
<br>
Cut sausage lengthwise, then crosswise in 
1/2 inch pieces to form half-moons. Season game hen pieces well with sea salt 
and ground black pepper.<br>
<br>
Pre-heat oven to 350F/180C. <br>
<br>
Heat 
broth in saucepan to boiling, then reduce to simmer and keep at simmer near 
paella pan. Have a ladle ready nearby too.<br>
<em>Note: It&rsquo;s important 
to add hot broth to the rice as you cook, so I usually have more liquid than I 
anticipate I might need. Adding cold or cool liquid to the rice will cool the 
rice and the pan and the liquid will not absorb properly into the rice grains.
</em> <br>
<br>
Heat paella pan, or other shallow wide pan, over medium heat, 
add 1 TBL olive oil, and gently fry sausage pieces until browned and cooked 
through, about 3-4 minutes each side. Remove all pieces to paper towel and set 
aside.<br>
<br>
In same pan (without washing), brown all pieces of the game 
hen, and remove to oiled oven-safe pan. Cover and put in pre-warmed oven.<br>

<br>Still using the same pan, add 2 TBL olive oil and onions. Cook until onion 
just start to turn transparent, about 4-5 minutes, then add garlic, cilantro 
and tomatoes. Cook until tomatoes start to turn a darker red color, another 3-4 
minutes. Move ingredients to the sides of the pan, and add last TBL oil to the 
center, then rice. Stir to coat rice evenly in oil and sofrito (the 
onion-tomato mixture). Increase heat to medium high, and continue to stir and 
toast the rice for another 3-5 minutes, or until the rice begins to crackle and 
pop.<br>
<br>
Just before the rice threatens to singe, pour the sake over the 
rice and stir through. You will hear a hiss of steam, which risotto guru 
Valentina Harris, author of &ldquo;Risotto! Risotto!&rdquo; calls<em> il sospiro
</em>, the sigh. Allow the rice grains to fully absorb the wine, stirring 
constantly, before adding a ladle of hot broth. Continue stirring until the 
liquid is again absorbed, then add another ladle. This method of allowing one 
ladle of broth to be fully absorbed before the next is added, allows the rice 
grains to swell slowly and cook properly, and helps to avoid the dreaded 
&ldquo;uncooked kernel&rdquo; that can haunt rushed risotti.<br>
<br>
Continue 
adding broth one ladle at a time, until rice grains start to look shiny and to 
stick together. Add the saffron and another ladle of broth, then turn heat down 
to medium, and add pepper strips and edamame to rice, and stir through. Add 
another ladle of broth if rice has absorbed most of the liquid, then add clams, 
cooked sausage and game hen pieces, another ladle of broth, and stir, then 
cover and allow to steam for 5 minutes. Add another one or two ladles of broth 
(depending on whether you prefer a dry or soupy texture), then shrimp, and 
cover again for another 5 minutes. Keep covered and remove from heat.<br>
<br>

Serve in shallow bowls or plates, garnish with calamansi to keep with the 
Pacific theme. A New Zealand or Australian sauvignon blanc is the perfect wine 
for this meal. Enjoy!<br>
<br>

<h1>Gl&uuml;hwein</h1>  December12 2008 Mulled or spiced wines are 
understandably popular when the weather turns cooler, and almost every country 
has its own version of mulled wine, wassail, or glogg. I confess I was never a 
fan until I spent my first winter in Germany &mdash; or rather, my first 
Christmas season. <em>Gl&uuml;hwein (GLOO - vine)</em> , roughly translated as 
&quot;glow wine,&quot; is the official beverage of the German <em>
Christkindlm&auml;rkte (KRIST-kin-del-merk-tuh)</em>  or <em>
Weihnachtsm&auml;rkte (VY-nahkts-merk-tuh)</em> , the world-renown Christmas 
markets!<br>
<br>
Gl&uuml;hwein  is both light-bodied and lightly spiced, which 
makes it eminently drinkable by the mugful as one wanders outdoors through the 
colorful stalls and festive displays of the markets. And when you're at a 
Christmas market, you will want to drink Gl&uuml;hwein by the mugful, not only 
because it's delicious, but also because it's winter in Germany and it's darn 
cold wandering through those markets!<br>
<br>
<br>
It is the lightness in both 
body and spice that distinguishes Gl&uuml;hwein from other mulled wines I've 
tried, and it's this same quality that made me such a fan. Unlike many other 
mulled wine recipes which are 100% wine, sweetened and spiced, Gl&uuml;hwein 
can be one-third to one-half water. This is what makes Gl&uuml;hwein both 
quaffable in large sips to keep warm, and quaffable without getting too tipsy 
throughout the long winter day and night as one revels in the festive spirit of 
the Christmas market. The amounts of each spice used in Gl&uuml;hwein are also 
generally less than in other mulled wines, so the finished drink is as easy on 
the palate as it is on the liver.<br>
<br>
There is something that seems just 
plain wrong about drinking Gl&uuml;hwein indoors. I can't remember ever seeing 
anyone drinking Gl&uuml;hwein inside a restaurant in Germany, although it might 
be on the menu. Having said all that, once it turned really cold here, we 
longed for a friendly mug of Gl&uuml;hwein to chase away the chill, even if we 
were drinking it at home. At least it was still cool in the house, unlike last 
winter when we made a batch of Gl&uuml;hwein in Hawaii! (Now <em>that</em>  was 
just wrong, and we couldn't really enjoy our drink when it was still 70F 
outside!)<br>
<br>
When making Gl&uuml;hwein, choose a cheap dry jug wine, such 
as a California Burgundy. No need for a pricey bottle here &mdash; not only are 
you going to add fruit and spices, but you're going to cut it with water, too. 
If you want to make this for a party, prepare the Base in triple or quadruple 
quantities, and divide the Base accordingly (into 3 or 4 batches). Then make 
each batch of<br>
<br>
Gl&uuml;hwein as needed by adding a bottle of wine to 
the Base, and heating gently. If you make a big batch at once and leave it 
simmering too long, the alcohol can cook out and the spices become bitter.<br>

<br> You can fortify and personalize your Gl&uuml;hwein by adding shots of your 
favorite liquor or liqueur to your mug. My favorite addition is amaretto, a 
combination that is sold as &quot;Heisse Liebe&quot; (Hot Love) at the 
Heidelberg Christmas market (seen here) where I first tried it. Even if we only 
have our memories of Germany's Christkindlm&auml;rkte now, at least we can 
still make a hot mug of Gl&uuml;hwein to keep us warm. <br>
<br>
<em>Now if 
only I could figure out where my Zimtwaffeleisen is ...</em> <br>
<br>

GL&uuml;HWEIN<br>
<br>
<br>
BASE:<br>
500 ml/ 2 cups water<br>
one orange, 
washed well, and sliced crosswise<br>
Peel from one lemon<br>
1 stick of 
cinnamon<br>
3 whole cloves <br>
3 tablespoons of raw sugar (only 2 TBL of 
regular sugar)<br>
3-4 whole green cardamom pods<br>
8-10 whole coriander seeds
<br> 1 vanilla bean<br>
<br>
Note: If you can only find decorticated ground 
cardamom (inner seeds removed from the pod and ground) at the supermarket, put 
about 1/4 tsp. together with the cloves and coriander seeds, in a tea ball or 
tie them up in a coffee filter, and boil with the other spices and fruits. 
Remove bag after wine has been added and warmed through.<br>
<br>
1 bottle 
(750ml) dry red wine<br>
Rum, brandy, amaretto, or other liqueur, if desired<br>
<br>Bring water to boil. Add orange slices, lemon peel, cinnamon, cloves, 
sugar, cardamom, coriander and vanilla bean. Return to boil, then turn heat 
down to medium high and cook for 25 minutes.<br>
<br>
The base can be prepared 
in advance, or in large quantities and kept refrigerated until needed. Re-heat 
Gl&uuml;hwein Base to boiling before adding wine.<br>
<br>
Add bottle of wine 
and turn heat down to simmer &ndash; DO NOT BOIL. Keep at simmer for 15 minutes.
<br> <br>
Pour into mugs, being careful not to pour in any of the whole spices. 
Add shots of rum, brandy, vodka, amaretto, hazelnut liqueur or sambuco as 
desired. Enjoy with spice cookies, such as Spekulaatis, Pfeffernusse, Molasses 
Crinkles , or Zimtwaffeln. <em>Zum Wohl!</em> <br>

<h1>Healthy Oceans, Healthy Choices: Kabocha Salmon Patties</h1>  December03 
2008 One of the things that often gets lost in our busy lives is time &mdash; 
time to listen, to read, to watch, to learn. We barely have enough time to do 
what needs to be done in 24 hours &mdash; forget researching things that may or 
may not directly affect us, our families, our health.<br>
<br>
If you have 
7-1/2 minutes to spare today, pour yourself a cup of tea or coffee while you 
check out this video from Oceana , a global non-profit organization committed 
to healthy oceans and sustainable fishing. It&rsquo;s about the mercury lurking 
in some of our seafood and some of the warning signs of mercury poisoning we 
may be feeling in ourselves or seeing in our loved ones without realizing what 
they mean. Fatigued? Problems concentrating? It may not just be stress.<br>
<br>
The point here is not to scare you off from seafood and fish &mdash; it&rsquo;s 
important to include these in your diet on a regular basis. It&rsquo;s equally 
important, though, to know what types of fish may pose a hazard to you or your 
family. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Last spring, we highlighted the convenience of the 
Monterey Bay Aquarium&rsquo;s Seafood Watch fish guides . These guides are 
tailored for each distinct region in the U.S., so we recently ordered the 
guides for our new area. (Guides are also available for other countries in 
Europe and Asia, see earlier post for more information ) If you have a mobile 
phone, you can save a tree and download the guides directly to your phone! The 
Seafood Watch guides provide at-a-glance, easy-to-decipher information about 
which species are farmed or fished in a sustainable manner (green is good, 
yellow is acceptable, red is bad), and which ones are known to have high levels 
of mercury (flagged).<br>
<br>
<br>
Now we&rsquo;d like to point you to another 
useful resource, Oceana&rsquo;s &ldquo;Green List&rdquo;  of national 
supermarket and warehouse chains that provide the FDA Advisory on mercury 
contamination at their fish counter. The stores on the List (including 
Shoppers, Safeway, Costco, Harris Teeter and Trader Joe&rsquo;s here in the DC 
metro area) voluntarily post the FDA Advisory at their fish counters and canned 
seafood aisles (called point-of-sale advisories) to remind consumers which fish 
may be at risk for mercury contamination, and what the safe limits are for 
consuming some at-risk fish.<br>
<br>
<em>Why is this important?</em>  Because 
it provides a reminder for you and all shoppers that some varieties of fish 
(including swordfish, tuna, king mackerel and tilefish) are known to have high 
levels of mercury in their flesh, and that people at-risk (including children, 
older people, pregnant women) should limit how much they eat of these 
varieties, or avoid them. But that leaves many other wonderful fish varieties 
to choose from! The point of sale advisories help you as a consumer so you 
don&rsquo;t have to struggle to remember which varieties are at-risk when 
you&rsquo;re standing in the grocery.<br>
<br>
Is the grocery chain where you 
shop on the Green List? Find out by following this link , which will also show 
you the Red List (which includes Giant and Super Fresh in our area) that do NOT 
post the Advisory.<br>
<br>
Another cool tool on the Oceana website is an 
interactive grocery store map  that allows you to input your area code, and 
click &ldquo;Find My Grocer!&rdquo; &mdash; a Google Map pops open with 
color-coded points showing you all the Green List and Red List grocery stores 
in your area. If you click on the colored point, the name and address of the 
store will appear. Finding your closest Green List grocer is just a click away!
<br><br>
<em>Note to Hawaii consumers, the Oceana Lists only include national 
chains. The Hawaiian Islands have unique grocery store chains that are not on 
these lists. I used to check the seafood counters at Don Quijote, Star Market 
and Foodland on Oahu regularly and found no FDA advisories and only sporadic 
country of origin notices. Both Monterey Bay Aquarium and Oceana have campaigns 
that allow you to bring your concerns to the store management&rsquo;s 
attention. Join the MBA&rsquo;s campaign on</em> <em>labelling fish and seafood 
with country of origin</em> <em> and/or Oceana&rsquo;s campaign on the</em> <em>
 FDA warning about mercury at the point of sale</em> <em>.<br>
</em> <br>

Following recommendations from both MBA and Oceana, we see that Alaskan wild 
salmon remain one of the best fish choices for the table. Both the fresh filets 
and canned varieties have healthy amounts of omega-3 fatty acids that reduce 
blood pressure and cholesterol and are fished in commercially sustainable ways.
<br><br>
Salmon patties made with canned Alaskan salmon and mashed potatoes are 
a delicious and economical way to eat healthy and stretch your budget dollar, 
too. The basic recipe is made with leftover mashed potatoes, but if you let 
your imagination roam, other interesting alternatives will come to mind. How 
about mashed tofu, if you want to cut down on the carbohydrates in your meal? 
Or sweet potatoes or yams, instead of russets? We especially like the sweet 
potato substitution with spicy notes like curry powder, garam masala, or jerk 
spices.<br>
<br>
<br>
Here&rsquo;s one version we did over the summer with 
leftover roasted kabocha and wasabi peas, and served with wasabi cocktail 
sauce. The crunchy peas add some texture to an otherwise very uniform patty, 
but the wasabi flavor was very mild &mdash; hence the need for the extra spicy 
cocktail sauce! Use fresh or frozen peas when wasabi peas are not available 
&mdash; they&rsquo;ll add color and extra nutrition, if not texture.<br>
<br>

Substitute any roasted or cooked hard squash in season for the kabocha: 
buttercup, butternut, Hubbard, blue and acorn are all in season now! Even 
pumpkin would be a nice medium for salmon patties.<br>
<br>
*Note: Wasabi peas 
are a Japanese snack food of fried or freeze-dried green peas coated with 
crunchy wasabi-flavored rice flour. Look for them in Asian groceries and Trader 
Joe&rsquo;s.<br>
<br>
KABOCHA SALMON PATTY with WASABI PEAS<br>
2 cups (360g) 
mashed roasted kabocha<br>
1/2 medium onion, minced (optional)<br>
1 large egg, 
beaten<br>
sea salt and ground black pepper<br>
1 small can (7.5 oz, 215g) 
Alaskan red salmon, drained and mashed<br>
1 cup (120g) wasabi peas<br>
1 
quantity Wasabi Cocktail Sauce (below)<br>
<br>
Add egg and onion to mashed 
sweet potatoes. Season well, and blend thoroughly. Add salmon, and roughly 
combine (we like to leave chunks of salmon noticeable in the patty, but you can 
combine to a smooth consistency if you prefer). Make a well in the center of 
the mixture, and add wasabi peas. Combine well. Shape into 2 large patties.<br>

<br> Preheat oven to 350F/180C, and preheat cast iron or other heavy oven-proof 
skillet over medium-high heat on the stove. Add about 1 TBL olive oil to the 
pan, and add patties to pan, pressing lightly. Turn heat to medium, and brown 
well, about 1-2 minutes. (Note: kabocha and sweet potatoes have more sugar than 
regular potatoes, and may darken and even burn more easily) Flip patty over, 
press lightly again, and move pan to pre-heated oven. Bake for 10-12 minutes, 
or until patties are firm to the touch. Meanwhile prepare cocktail sauce.<br>

<br>Serve hot with cocktail sauce, salad or your favorite cooked greens, and 
rice or rolls.<br>
If you serve this with some type of corn &mdash; cornbread, 
polenta, succotash, corn chowder , etc. you would have a wonderful meal 
combining the &ldquo;Three Sisters.&rdquo; More on that soon.<br>
<br>
WASABI 
COCKTAIL SAUCE<br>
1 TBL prepared wasabi paste<br>
1 TBL lemon juice<br>
1/4 
cup ketchup<br>
dash Tabasco<br>
2-3 TBL capers, drained and rinsed<br>
<br>

Combine all ingredients. Set aside.<br>

<h1>On the Move with Cats, Part 2</h1>  November24 2008  This is the second in 
a two-part post about travelling, especially during a permanent relocation, 
with cats.Part 1  covered 2 natural therapies we have used to keep the cats 
calm, and offered tips about non-traditional places to stay during your move. 
This part touches on kennel-training and insights about using U.S. carriers 
when your pets travel as cargo. Everything in this series is based on our 
personal experience with the three cats we have travelled with, and is not 
intended to substitute for the advice of your own veterinarian.<br>
<br>
<br>

<br> KENNEL-TRAINING<br>
We have a sign that says, &ldquo;Dogs have masters; 
Cats have staff.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s usually the case that cats are better at 
training their humans than we are at training them, but one instance when 
training can be really important is preparing your cat to be in a kennel or 
travel crate for long periods of time if she has to fly. If your cat has never 
been in a kennel or has only spent a short time travelling to or from the vet 
or groomer, then it will help your pet to practice being in a kennel for the 
same amount of time it will have to travel. For instance, if you&rsquo;re 
putting your cat on a 3-hour flight and have to check her in 2 hours before 
departure, that&rsquo;s at least a 5-hour time frame (more like 6 or 7) she 
will be in the kennel.<br>
<br>
Kennel training does several things for your 
friend. One, it allows her to slowly get used to being in a kennel while 
she&rsquo;s still in a familiar environment, her own home. Two, the timed 
training period will give her a sense that there&rsquo;s a light at the end of 
this tunnel, and that she will see you again and maybe get a treat and a 
cuddle. Three, it gives her a chance to make the kennel her own &mdash; it will 
have her smell in it, and will become familiar and safe.<br>
<br>
Begin 
kennel-training as far in advance of your travel as time will allow.<br>
1. Use 
the actual kennel in which the cat will be travelling &mdash; put water and 
food dishes in place, too. Also use an absorbent lining for the floor of the 
kennel, and maybe a shirt or small towel that has your scent on it (this will 
also help to keep your cat calm). Most airlines will not allow any toys in the 
kennel, so don&rsquo;t put any toys that she won&rsquo;t be able to take on the 
trip. The point is the kennel will look and smell the same as it will on the 
day of travel.<br>
<br>
2. Prepare the kennel with Feliway or Comfort Zone, if 
using: spray around the corners of the kennel 30 minutes before the cat goes 
in. (See Part 1  for information about these natural alternatives to keep your 
cat calm)<br>
<br>
3. Start with short time periods similar to a trip to the 
vet (10-20 minutes), and increase the time by 20-30 minute increments each day. 
As the time periods increase to hours, put food and water in the dishes so the 
cat is used to eating and drinking from them. The airlines won&rsquo;t allow 
food in the kennels during the flight, but they will put food and water in the 
dishes during layovers if you provide the food. Check with your airline&rsquo;s 
policy for pets travelling as cargo.<br>
<br>
4. If at all possible, try to 
make the experience a pleasant one. Don&rsquo;t chase the cat and throw her in 
the kennel every day because obviously she&rsquo;ll be suspicious and 
traumatized by then. Once she&rsquo;s in the crate, spend a few minutes 
assuring her she&rsquo;s OK, but don&rsquo;t stay too close the whole time 
&mdash; the point of the exercise is to get her used to being alone and to 
learn that you will come back for her. Then at the end, offer her a favorite 
treat &mdash; for our cats, it&rsquo;s usually a cuddle and a good scratch 
around the ears &mdash; but catnip, treats, or whatever she considers special 
will work. One cat we knew loved broccoli!<br>
<br>
Three weeks before their 
flight, we started kennel-training Kio. This would be his first plane trip. We 
figured Haiku had been through so many moves and long car trips that she 
didn&rsquo;t need the practice, but Kio hated kennels and he would soil his 
kennel even in the short 7-minute trip from home to the vet!<br>
<br>
After a 
couple of days, Kio had stopped soiling the kennel but was still mewing and 
letting everyone know he was not a happy camper. Then it occurred to T that 
maybe the process seemed like a punishment since Kio was singled out for this 
treatment, while Haiku was left roaming around. He was right &mdash; as soon as 
Haiku joined the routine, Kio settled down. Haiku lay down and went to sleep 
once she realized she wasn&rsquo;t going to the vet; and by the second time 
they trained together, Kio actually walked into his kennel, lay down and fell 
asleep, too! By the end of the training period, he would remain asleep in his 
kennel even after the door was opened. When we dropped them off at the cargo 
office for their flight, Kio was noticeably anxious but he didn&rsquo;t claw or 
cry. When Mike picked them up in D.C. 18 hours later, he called to say that Kio 
walked out of his clean kennel, plopped on a rug and made himself quite at 
home. (Mike had the Comfort Zone diffuser  plugged in at his home, too.) <br>

<br> <br>
FLYING IN THE U.S. WITH PETS<br>
<em>(This only applies to pets that 
are NOT travelling in the passenger cabin with you)</em> <br>
Travelling with 
pets on a U.S. carrier presents some challenges. Going from Hawaii to D.C. was 
the first time we tried to do this. What we learned is that only one  U.S. 
airline will guarantee travel with pets as cargo (our cats are too big to 
travel under the seat in the passenger cabin). What this means is that the 
other airlines will allow you to make reservations, BUT they can still refuse 
to accept your pet on the travel day if any stop in their itinerary is too hot 
or too cold. Translation: if you&rsquo;re planning to have your pets travel in 
cargo on the same flight with you, you might find out that the airline will NOT 
let your pet be checked-in on the day you have reserved for them. The airlines 
can even call passengers AFTER the pets have been checked in (in some cases the 
passengers might already be passed security and waiting at the boarding gate) 
and tell them it has been determined that it will be too hot or too cold for 
the pet to travel in cargo. What does the passenger do then? The agents we 
talked to on the phone at Delta and United basically said: Not our problem.<br>

<br>We would have liked to travel on the same flight with the cats on this 
trip, but unfortunately our flight was arranged and paid by T&rsquo;s employer 
who did not have travel contracts with the only airline that will guarantee pet 
travel reservations. We were travelling in August and were being routed through 
the Southeast, so it was a good bet that the airline we were flying with would 
cancel the cats&rsquo; reservations at the last minute and this was a stress we 
did not want or need. So we opted to have them fly out earlier on a different 
airline &mdash; the only one that would guarantee a travel day. We were also 
fortunate to have a kind person on the other end who offered to pick them up 
and take care of them until we got to D.C.<br>
<br>
The only U.S. carrier that 
guarantees reserved travel for your pet (as cargo) is Continental Airlines  
&mdash; they are the only airline that has temperature-controlled holding areas 
for animals at all their major hubs. This might mean that you will not have the 
same itinerary as your pet, or that you will have to pay more for your flight 
if you want to match your pet&rsquo;s itinerary, but at least you can count on 
your pet leaving when promised. The folks at the Continental cargo center in 
Honolulu told us that they often see frantic travellers at their counter who 
are trying to get their pet on a cargo flight an hour before their own flight 
is scheduled to leave because their airline refused to accept the pets at the 
last minute. Of course, trying to re-book at the last minute doesn&rsquo;t 
always work out (and if someone can&rsquo;t pick up your pet at the airport, 
the animal shelter will be called in) or people have to pay a premium price 
because they don&rsquo;t have a reservation.<br>
<br>
If you are not travelling 
on the same flight with or same itinerary as your pet, Continental allows you 
to track your pet&rsquo;s flight and offers updates on their arrival at each 
stop. It also offers an extra service for pets whose itinerary goes through 
their Houston hub and whose layover is more than 3 hours long. For an 
additional fee per pet, you can have your pet&rsquo;s kennel cleaned and your 
pet exercised, groomed, fed and given water. The amount of the fee will depend 
on the type and size of the animal; for cats it was an additional $75 for the 
first cat, and $50 for the second. Haiku and Kio had a 5-hour flight from 
Honolulu, a 5-hour layover in Houston, and another 3-hour flight to D.C., so it 
seemed like a worthwhile investment this time. If you don&rsquo;t want the 
extra service, Continental will still give your pet water and any food you 
provide (dry food in a ziploc pouch taped to the kennel) during their layover, 
but the pet will not be allowed out of the kennel, and food and water will only 
be given through the locked door.<br>
<br>
From the moment you know you have to 
re-locate until a few months after everything is unpacked and in its new place, 
there will be some stress and tension in the pets in your life. Think about how 
stressed you feel &mdash; and you know what&rsquo;s going on and are (mostly) 
in control! Your pet has no idea why or to where you are moving, or even if 
they will be going with you. They may become clingy, talkative (mewing a lot), 
combative or depressed; or they may overeat or stop eating. Take a little time 
to reassure and comfort, and take to heart the Girl Scout motto and help them 
&ldquo;Be Prepared&rdquo; for the journey ahead. And when your pet invites you 
to play, accept the invitation &mdash; it will have a calming effect on you, 
too!<br>

<h1>On the Move with Cats</h1>  November24 2008 <br>
The American Psychiatric 
Association recognizes relocating, or moving, as one of the most stressful 
challenges we can face. It&rsquo;s right behind death of a spouse or family 
member, and divorce and losing/changing jobs. But there are things we humans 
can do to prepare and to take care of ourselves throughout the moving process. 
We understand what&rsquo;s happening &mdash; and even with children, we can 
talk to them and help them process what they&rsquo;re feeling and what to 
expect in their new home.<br>
<br>
Not so with our four-legged furry friends. 
What our pets see is that their people are stressing, and one day all their 
furniture and other stuff with their smell on it is taken away. Then it&rsquo;s 
a series of strange places to stay, maybe a long car ride (or worse, a crate 
and dark plane ride for a long, long time), and finally another strange house 
with all their stuff in unfamiliar places. <em>Hey, what gives?!</em>  I 
suspect dogs may have an easier time with this adjustment &mdash; we 
haven&rsquo;t made any moves with dogs, so I can&rsquo;t say for sure.<br>
<br>

<br> But cats, especially indoor-only cats, are all about The Routine: <em>I 
wake up when I feel like it, but My Bowls are filled at This Time, twice a day, 
even if I have to walk across someone&rsquo;s pillow or tickle someone with my 
whiskers; I sit by This Window to watch the birds, and that Other Window at 
exactly That Hour when the sunny spot hits me just so; my people come home at 
This Hour and I spend half an hour letting them brush me and pay me the 
Attention I deserve...</em>  So what happens when The Routine is interrupted 
and Things Change?... Acting out (spraying, fighting, scratching furniture), 
loss of appetite or overeating, clinginess, depression, just about any reaction 
you can expect from a human... (See Cat's-Eye View: When Our Pets Decide To 
Move Without Consulting Us) <br>
<br>
In the last 11 years we&rsquo;ve moved 
five times, twice literally across the world, with two cats. Unquestionably our 
toughest move in terms of pet travel was going from Germany to Hawaii because 
of Hawaii&rsquo;s strict quarantine laws. Because Hawaii is rabies-free, they 
understandably want to keep it that way and so there is a long-standing 4-month 
quarantine on incoming animals (same is true in the U.K. and Guam, both also 
rabies-free). Fortunately for us, just a year or so before we moved there, the 
quarantine regulations were loosened to allow the pets to fulfill the 
quarantine period BEFORE you get to the Islands. It&rsquo;s a very strict 
protocol, with numerous steps and expensive tests and fees. But if you&rsquo;re 
considering bringing your pets with you when you move to Hawaii, it&rsquo;s 
considerably better for your pet to follow this protocol than to allow them to 
languish in quarantine for 4 months.<br>
<br>
WHERE TO STAY<br>
What we 
didn&rsquo;t realize when we moved to Hawaii, until it was almost too late, was 
that if you successfully by-pass the quarantine for your pets, there are no 
hotels &mdash; on Oahu, at least &mdash; that will allow you to keep pets with 
you! Actually when we moved in 2005, there was one hotel and one short-term 
apartment rental that did allow pets, but they have both changed their rules. 
So unless you have family or friends in Hawaii willing to house your pet, you 
might have to kennel your pets while you house-hunt &mdash; which defeats one 
of the purposes of avoiding quarantine.<br>
<br>
One alternative we found on 
Oahu is to find advertised private vacation rentals that will allow you to keep 
your pets with you (we used <em>craigslist</em> ). On this latest move, we 
found a high-rise 1-bedroom condo in the heart of Waikiki that was less 
expensive per night than any hotel, even those with special local or military 
rates. Make sure pets are okay, and that payment is made through some kind of 
system with guarantees (we used Paypal) so your money doesn&rsquo;t disappear 
before you get a set of keys. You may be asked to pay a deposit, in our case 
the deposit was refundable once the Lessor knew there was no damage from the 
pets.<br>
<br>
In Germany we have also booked with pet-friendly private 
vacation rentals, called <em>Ferienwohnungen (or FeWo, for short)</em> , when 
entering or leaving the country. These are usually fully furnished private 
apartments, many of which include breakfast or at least Brotchen delivery 
service in the mornings. They too are usually cheaper than hotels, and provide 
all the amenities of home, including cable or satellite internet connections, 
washer and dryer in the unit, linens, and fully equipped kitchens. In general, 
it is much easier to travel with pets in Europe, especially Germany, than in 
the U.S. but your pet is expected to be well-behaved and clean. And it helps to 
know what to expect: many FeWo are attached to the landlord&rsquo;s home, are 
located outside the main city or town, and the landlord usually speaks a 
smattering of English (but which was always much better than our German).<br>

<br> In the U.S., you can find lists of &ldquo;pet-friendly&rdquo; hotels and 
motels , but call directly to the hotel you&rsquo;re planning to stay in 
&mdash; rather than the hotel chain&rsquo;s 800-number &mdash; because these 
policies can change very quickly ( <em>&ldquo;One bad apple&rdquo; </em> <em>can
</em> <em> spoil the whole bunch, Girl&quot;</em> ). If you&rsquo;re planning 
to bring more than one animal, ask if it&rsquo;s okay before you get there 
&mdash; some places only allow one pet per room. And get the okay about pets in 
writing in your confirmation email. By the same token, some places that 
advertise only one pet per room may let you keep more than one cat or smaller 
dogs if they do not disturb other guests. But consider, hotels that accept pets 
(not counting premium 3 and 4 star properties, of course) are generally not 
centrally located and often require deposits or charge extra fees.<br>
<br>

NATURAL THERAPIES<br>
To prepare your cat for any stressful situation (vet 
visit, boarding, relocation) there are 2 products we highly recommend &mdash; 
one can be used by humans as well as pets, but the other is specific to cats. 
The first is &ldquo;Dr. Bach&rsquo;s Rescue Remedy&rdquo;, a British 
homeopathic formula that includes over a dozen flower essences &mdash; it is 
sold in dropper bottles or sprays. I discovered Dr. B&rsquo;s on the 
recommendation of the house mother I lived with in London when I was studying 
at Leith&rsquo;s &mdash; a few drops in your tea or under the tongue helps to 
calm nerves in just a few minutes. A few drops in your cat&rsquo;s drinking 
water does the same for your pet. When we know a stressful situation is coming 
up, we&rsquo;ll begin adding the drops to the cats&rsquo; water every day for 2 
weeks before the event. In cases like a relocation, we&rsquo;ll add it to their 
water or put one drop in soft food throughout the process. Dr. Bach&rsquo;s 
($10-17) is available in the U.S. at many health food stores, Whole Foods 
markets, and on Oahu, at Star Market.<br>
<br>
<br>
The other product is called 
Feliway spray &mdash; which is available by that brand name, or as a component 
in &ldquo;Comfort Zone&rdquo; spray in the U.S. As its name implies, Feliway is 
designed for cats. It&rsquo;s a pheromone-based spray that calms felines. It 
was first prescribed by our German vets when Haiku and Laika were flying from 
Germany to Boston. The spray is used on your cat&rsquo;s kennel, bedding, toys 
or other objects that the cat is around &mdash; don&rsquo;t spray the cat 
itself! A newer product is the Comfort Zone plug-in room diffuser, which uses 
the same technology as those plug-ins that release fragrances into a room, 
except these have no fragrance (at least we don&rsquo;t smell anything). This 
was particularly helpful when Haiku and Kio spent a week at our friend 
Mike&rsquo;s home in DC before we joined them, and then in the series of hotels 
we all endured over the next 3 weeks, and finally our new home. One diffuser 
lasted about one month. You can find both CZ spray ($20 and up) and diffuser 
($35-50) at PetSmart and Feliway ($13-25) on-line from Ashley's Animal Ark . 
Once you have a diffuser you can buy just the refills. We&rsquo;ve seen 
Feliway/CZ lessen stress activities such as constant mewing, clawing at kennel 
doors and floors, and &ldquo;spraying.&quot; But it also works in other stress 
situations &mdash; fighting among household pets or introducing new animals (or 
babies) to the family.<br>
<br>
But just like catnip (25% of cats are not 
affected by catnip), one or both of these products may not work on all cats. We 
just wanted to share our experiences in case other people are looking for 
non-pharmaceutical alternatives to travelling with their feline friends. 
Everything in this series is based on our personal experience with the three 
cats we have travelled with, and is not intended to substitute for the advice 
of your own veterinarian.<br>

<h1>Lamb Shanks with Preserved Lemons and Gremolata</h1>  November19 2008 <br>

<br> This is something we actually made while still in Hawaii during the middle 
of our move. Although it takes some initial prep to trim and brown the lamb 
shanks, most of the cooking can be done in a slow cooker while you tend to the 
rest of your life. This recipe was devised to put to use two key ingredients we 
had in the pantry: lamb shanks and preserved lemons. This is an incredibly 
hearty meal better suited for cold winter months &mdash; guess we&rsquo;ll have 
to make it again once our newest batch of preserved lemons is ready in 4 weeks.
<br><br>
Lemons and red wine may sound like a strange combination for braising 
meat, but they marry together beautifully in this dish. The recipe is adapted 
from one we&rsquo;ve used before using fresh lemons ( original recipe ). The 
preserved lemons keep a true lemon flavor even after long cooking, while the 
gremolata brightens the flavors as you savor every mouthful. We found the 
combination really exquisite, and this will be our go-to recipe from here on 
out.<br>
<br>
Gremolata is a classic Italian garnish for osso bucco, and is 
just a quick mince of fresh parsley, garlic and lemon peel. This is best done 
just before serving to keep the flavors of the garlic and lemon peel fresh. It 
is an unbeatable way to brighten flavors of long-simmered stews or braised 
meats.<br>
<br>
LAMB SHANKS WITH PRESERVED LEMONS AND GREMOLATA <br>
Serves 2 
persons<br>
<em>To prepare 4 shanks, double everything except the 2 TBL oil for 
browning (keep same amount), and the balsamic vinegar (use 1/3 cup)</em> <br>

<br> Lamb Shanks <br>
1 large onions, thinly sliced<br>
2 bay leaves<br>
3 TBL 
olive oil + 2 TBL olive oil for browning<br>
2 lamb shanks<br>
1 cup dry red 
wine<br>
4 cloves garlic, minced<br>
4-6 pieces of preserved lemon , to equal 1 
lemon<br>
 remove pulp and thinly slice rind<br>
6-8 sprigs fresh oregano, or 1 
tsp dried<br>
1/4 cup balsamic vinegar<br>
1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes<br>
 sea salt and fresh ground black pepper<br>
<br>
Pour 3 TBL. of oil into bottom 
of slow cooker, layer with onions and bay leaves. Turn heat on slow cooker to 
LOW, cover and trim lamb.<br>
<br>
Trim lamb shanks by removing excess fat and 
membrane surrounding meat. Then cut (update 11/24/08: <em>but do not remove</em>
) the tendon that connects meat to top of the bone &mdash; it&rsquo;s easier to 
trim the fat and membrane while the tendon is still attached, so leave the 
tendon for last.<br>
<br>
<br>
Brown the shanks well in a heavy bottomed 
skillet, then transfer them to slow cooker as they finish browning. Pour off 
the fat, add garlic and cook just until garlic are fragrant, about 1 minute. 
Turn the heat up to high, and immediately pour red wine into the skillet to 
de-glaze. Stir to bring up the browned bits in the pan. Boil for about 1 
minute, then pour deglazing liquid over lamb.<br>
<br>
Sprinkle lemons and 
oregano over and around shanks, then pour balsamic vinegar and diced tomatoes. 
Season well with salt and pepper.<br>
<br>
Cover and leave on LOW for 7-8 hours 
or until meal is fall-off-the -bone tender. Or you can layer everything instead 
in a heavy dutch oven and place in the preheated oven (325F/160C) to cook for 3 
hours.<br>
<br>
Before serving, remove shanks from sauce and keep warm. Cook 
sauce on HIGH in slow cooker with no cover to reduce sauce while you prepare 
the Gremolata and polenta.<br>
<br>
Gremolata<br>
1 small bunch of flat-leaf 
parsley, washed well and dried<br>
Peel from one fresh lemon<br>
1-2 cloves 
garlic, peeled and sliced<br>
<br>
With a very sharp knife, finely mince 
parsley and place in a bowl. Combine lemon peel and sliced garlic on cutting 
board, and mince together. Add minced lemon-garlic to parsley and mix well. 
Serve with lamb shanks.<br>
<br>
To serve, spoon creamy polenta onto plate. 
Place one shank over polenta, spoon sauce over lamb, and sprinkle gremolata 
over. Serve extra gremolata at the table.<br>

<h1>Learning from Our Friends: Going Meatless with Kitchiri</h1>  November17 
2008 <br>
<br>
<br>
Finally, we&rsquo;re back in real time on this 
site...It&rsquo;s been a long haul and we&rsquo;re still not 100% settled. This 
is by far the most difficult move we&rsquo;ve had to make, and glad it&rsquo;s 
almost over. One of the things that starts to signal a return to normalcy is 
when familiar things show up in the pantry again &mdash; old friends like these
preserved lemons! This is a jar I just started 5 days ago and topped up with 
olive oil this morning. As we know by now, it&rsquo;ll be 4+ weeks before this 
batch is ready to use. That&rsquo;s okay, it&rsquo;s worth the wait.<br>
<br>

Preparing these lemons was bittersweet, too. It was a reminder of thepreserved 
lemon torta we prepared last summer and sent as part of the appeal to raise 
money for our fellow blogger, Briana Brownlow at<em>Figs with Bri.</em> The 
appeal was to help Bri pay for the costs of her treatments in her second battle 
with breast cancer. During our hiatus, we learned from the fundraiser&rsquo;s 
organizers atJugalbandi that Bri died on October 26, 2008, at the too young age 
of 32. I will always think of the sunny optimism Bri&rsquo;s site and her 
personality inspired, and associate that with the bright yellow and sunny 
flavor of lemons. Our deepest condolences and prayers go to Marc and all 
Bri&rsquo;s family and friends. Thank you for allowing us to share in her 
warmth and optimism.<br>
<br>
One of the things that Bri, as well as Bee and 
Jai, Shilpa and Dhivya, and other vegetarian bloggers continue to teach us is 
that modern vegetarian cooking is incredibly diverse and imaginative. 
It&rsquo;s not all tofu and brown rice! And while we haven&rsquo;t made the 
leap to vegetarianism ourselves, we continue to strive for 2-3 meatless meals 
each week. Kitchiri or Khichdi, the basis for the British dish called Kedgeree, 
is one of our favorites: usually a mix of lentils or split peas with rice in a 
spice-laden porridge, this is one of the most versatile and tasty dishes around 
(Shilpa even has a version withtapioca and potatoes that is on our to-try list).
<br> <br>
<br>
After sampling many different versions from the Web and from 
cookbooks since April, we&rsquo;ve evolved a version of our own that can be 
thrown together without reference to a recipe (<em>aahhh, The Way of Cooking 
continues</em>): using 3 parts pulses (dried split peas or lentils) to 2 parts 
rice cooked with turmeric and ground cumin, a seasoned oil topping (the tadka 
or tarka), and usually grated coconut (it&rsquo;s not only yummy, it&rsquo;s 
supposed to be helpful with T&rsquo;s thyroid condition) and a mix of other 
vegetables (squash, hard or summer; corn; greens; even breadfruit). Although 
the basics are the same from week to week, changing the type of pea or lentil 
used, and the availability of seasonal vegetables keeps us from getting bored 
with this wonderful dish. Choose a split pea or lentil for faster cooking and 
Even in Hawaii&rsquo;s hot summer months, kitchiri was a warm and welcome meal 
at the end of the day, but it&rsquo;s especially beloved now as the days get 
shorter and the evenings colder here in metro DC. It also makes a hearty and 
filling alternative to oatmeal or other hot cereal in the morning &mdash; we 
often have the previous night&rsquo;s leftovers for breakfast. Add a little 
broth or water when you re-heat the kitchiri, as it will thicken as it sits.<br>
<br> <br>
BASIC GUIDELINES FOR KITCHIRI OR KEDGEREE <br>
Serves 4-6 persons <br>
<br>1-1/2 cups split lentils or peas <br>
1 cup rice, medium or long grain <br>

2 tsp. turmeric<br>
1 tsp. ground cumin <br>
6 cups water <br>
1 tsp. sea salt 
<br> <br>
Wash well and check for small pebbles in lentils or peas. Separately 
wash and rinse rice. Combine pulses, rice and water in large dutch oven. Bring 
to boil over high heat, removing foam as it rises to surface. When water 
reaches a boil, turn heat down to medium, add turmeric, cumin, and salt, and 
allow to simmer 20-30 minutes, or until pulses just begin to soften. Meanwhile, 
prepare the tarka.<br>
<br>
Tarka <br>
The tarka, or seasoned oil, is another 
area where you can be creative about what combination of spices you use. But if 
you&rsquo;ve never tried popped brown or black mustard seeds, I urge you to 
search them out at an Indian or Asian grocer &mdash; I&rsquo;ve even found them 
in Chinese markets. The aroma and flavor of popped mustard seeds does not 
really have an equal in the culinary world, and adds a wonderful dimension to 
this and many other dishes (see alsoChaat Potatoes for another great use of 
this ingredient). Whatever combination of spices you choose, cooking them in 
oil with the onions and garlic will add another depth to the flavors you are 
creating. As for the asafoetida, it also has a flavor that can&rsquo;t be 
substituted, and it has the added benefit of reducing the &ldquo;gassy&rdquo; 
effects of the pulses &mdash; Leave it out at your own peril!<br>
<br>
2 TBL. 
olive oil, or other light-tasting oil<br>
1 TBL. brown mustard seed <br>
1 
medium onion, diced fine<br>
2 cloves garlic, minced <br>
5-6 curry leaves 
(optional)<br>
1 tsp. ground coriander <br>
1/2 tsp. amchur, ground green mango 
powder<br>
1/4 tsp. ground asafoetida <br>
1 tsp. garam masala <br>
2&rdquo; 
stick cinnamon<br>
1-3 serrano peppers, seeded and sliced (optional, we have to 
leave this out on the advice of our acupuncturist)<br>
<br>
Heat oil over 
medium-high heat. Add brown mustard seeds to oil, and as soon as they start 
popping and releasing their popcorn-like aroma (which is usually immediately), 
add onions and garlic. Turn heat down to medium, cover, and cook until onions 
are translucent and soft, about 10 minutes.<br>
<br>
Add curry leaves, 
coriander powder, amchur, asafoetida, garam masala, and cinnamon stick. Stir 
together and cook until spices are fragrant, about 2-3 minutes. Add tarka to 
simmering pulses and rice. Check water level, you may need to add 1/2 cup to 1 
cup more water (will depend on type of lentil/peas used). Stir spices through, 
cover and continue cooking over medium heat for 10 minutes.<br>
<br>
To Finish: 
<br>Sea salt, to taste <br>
4 oz. frozen or fresh grated coconut <br>
8 oz. 
roasted or cooked kabocha, butternut, acorn, or other hard squash<br>
or any 
combination of summer squashes (zucchini, yellow), corn, upo or other gourd, 
fresh green beans or peas, or raw or flash-cooked greens (seeFlash-cooked 
Chinese mustard greensor Watercress). We&rsquo;ve also used roasted breadfruit, 
edamame, frozen spinach, and lima beans &mdash; let your imagination and 
seasonal vegetables be your guide! This may also be a way to sneak in 
vegetables people THINK they don&rsquo;t like... sneaky, yes, but sometimes 
necessary. (Note to my MIL and FIL: I would NEVER do this to you guys! Everyone 
else takes their chances in my kitchen...)<br>
<br>
Taste mixture, and season 
with salt as necessary.<br>
Add a mix of vegetables from the list above to the 
pot, and continue cooking until pulses are cooked soft, about another 20-30 
minutes, check water level after 15 minutes, and add more as needed.<br>
<br>

Garnish with minced cilantro or green onion, and serve with naan, roti or other 
flatbread, and maybe a yogurt raita.<br>

<h1>Spicy Seafood Stew w/Kauai Shrimp &amp; Hawaii Abalone</h1>  October13 2008
November 14, 2008<br>
Another post that has been back-logged... The biggest 
stumbling block was finding time and the will to process and edit the photos to 
go with these last two posts.<br>
<br>
A look back at our last few nights on 
Oahu and some of incredible local seafood: Shrimp from Kauai and Abalone from 
the Big Island.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
In the midst of the rush to leave Oahu, 
there were so-o-o-o many things to do and so many decisions to be made: what to 
take, what to leave behind, how will the cats fly across country &mdash; with 
us or alone. One thing was a no-brainer: that we were going to do justice to 
the stock of Hawaii seafood, natural grass-fed beef, and produce we had in the 
pantry and freezer &mdash; we weren&rsquo;t going to give them away or just 
cook them for the sake of finishing them off, we were going to savor and enjoy 
them... No matter what... Even if we had to eat 5 meals a day...<br>
<br>
This 
is easier said than done because Life Happens &mdash; meals take time to plan 
and prepare and often the days were too short and after a day of packing, 
cleaning, and dealing with bureaucratic details, our energy level was pretty 
much ZERO. So it wasn&rsquo;t until we had moved out of our rental house and 
into a vacation condo in Waikiki, shipped the car, and sent the cats safely on 
their way to Washington that we had the time and energy to return to 
meal-planning for some of the more prized treasures in the freezer &mdash; 
succulent, sweet shrimp from Kauai and plump and luxurious abalone from the Big 
Island.<br>
<br>
I have only had fresh abalone once before, almost 20 years 
earlier &mdash; it was the large meaty California abalone that can be found in 
the cold deep waters north of San Francisco. Those dessert plate-sized 
shellfish had been harvested by a friend&rsquo;s family, and then sliced thin 
and lightly pan-fried with garlic and wine. Sweet, tender but with a chew 
&mdash; absolutely divine. I was also familiar with the abalone-like shellfish 
that is sold canned in many Asian markets &mdash; much more chewy and salty, 
often cooked in an oyster sauce with mushrooms and other vegetables. The 
Hawaii-grown abalone were miniature and cute &mdash; the largest not much 
bigger than a half-dollar. They&rsquo;re sold under wrap on styroform trays, 
and even when defrosted smelled of the ocean, and appeared to have lost no 
moisture while frozen. We removed them from the shell and added them to the 
seafood stew below. After their brief bath in the spicy broth, they came out 
tasty and tender, with a slight chew reminiscent of chopped littleneck clams.
<br> <br>
<br>
Oahu has a shrimp farm or two on its North Shore, in and around 
Kahuku, and we were great fans of sweet Kahuku shrimp, both fresh and cooked 
from the many &ldquo;shrimp trucks&rdquo; that dot Kahuku, Haleiwa, and even 
downtown Waikiki. But earlier this summer Rowena&rsquo;s post about the Taste 
of Hawaii  featured large Kauai prawns as one of the entrees, and this sent us 
on a quest to find Kauai prawns on Oahu. Expecting to find Kauai prawns in the 
fresh seafood case, we were disappointed in our search until one day Don 
Quijote supermarket had a special on Kauai shrimp...in the frozen food aisle. 
Hmmmm... didn&rsquo;t sound too promising... frozen shrimp &mdash; not prawns 
&mdash; in a 2 lb. bag. But we tried it. And loved it. Wow! To call these 
shrimp &ldquo;sweet&rdquo; is an understatement. They are morsels of sea-sweet 
succulence.<br>
<br>
Our first hint that these shrimp were going to be 
different from other commercial frozen shrimp came when we first opened the bag 
to use the shrimp to garnish the Ewa sweet corn soup . Most frozen shrimp smell 
like nothing (if you&rsquo;re lucky), or they smell fishy and should be thrown 
out. These shrimp from the Garden Isle smelled of the ocean &mdash; fresh, 
briny and clean. It was already a delight, and the shrimp weren&rsquo;t even 
cooked yet! By the time we were safely ensconced in Waikiki, we still had over 
a pound of shrimp left, as well as the abalone, 2 grass-fed sirloin steaks from 
the North Shore, and one last bottle of Pommard hand-carried from Bourgogne. We 
were going to eat well for our last few days on Oahu...<br>
<br>
<br>
The 
shrimp was divided into 2 meals. First, garlic-butter shrimp  ala Gilroy was 
part of a meal of appetizers, or pupus, which also included prosciutto-parmesan 
bread sticks, methi-potato frittata, locally grown cherry tomatoes, extra-sharp 
Tillamook cheddar, pickled mango from Haleiwa, and purchased futomaki sushi. 
Washed down with ice-cold California sparkling wine and with the sunset from 
our 11th story perch, this was a lazy meal to sit back and reflect on all the 
things that had happened during our 3+ years in Hawaii. The next night the 
shrimp was part of a spicy seafood stew (recipe below) &mdash; paired with a 
sourdough loaf and our favorite Zinfandel from Folie a Deux winery, it was our 
last home-cooked meal on Oahu. The sweet shrimp, spicy Portuguese sausage and 
tender abalone married well together in the fennel and orange broth.<br>
<br>

The Kauai shrimp, like their Kahuku cousins, have a very thin shell that is 
difficult to remove in one piece &mdash; in fact, in dishes like garlic shrimp 
and this stew, we just pinch off the legs and munch through the shell (similar 
to eating soft-shell crab), leaving only the taill! I think you can only do 
this with really thin-shelled shrimp &mdash; I wouldn&rsquo;t try eating 
through the shell of a black tiger shrimp. Even if you don&rsquo;t like the 
idea of munching through the shells, I recommend cooking the shrimp in their 
shells even though this makes for a messy meal &mdash; it keeps the shrimp from 
losing their distinct sea flavor and sweetness. Just keep a moist towel for 
each diner on hand.<br>
<br>
For our last night in paradise, I hung up my apron 
and we took our cue from Tasty Island&rsquo;s  Pomai and booked a seaside table 
at the Ocean House restaurant, Outrigger Hotel-Kalia, for a most memorable 
sunset dinner featuring pan-seared Kona Kampachi, another locally farmed fish 
only available in restaurants in Hawaii. It was a delicious meal, and the view 
of Diamond Head only a couple of miles away in one direction, and the red 
setting sun in the other made it unforgettable. (Follow the link to <em>Tasty 
Island</em> for the photos and write-up that made this a must-do for us before 
we left.) <em>Thanks for the recommendation, Pomai, it made our bittersweet 
last evening on Oahu much more sweet than bitter...<br>
</em> <br>
<br>
SPICY 
SEAFOOD STEW W/ KAUAI SHRIMP &amp; HAWAII ABALONE<br>
Serves 2<br>
<br>
<em>We 
used locally grown shrimp and abalone, and Hawaiian Portuguese sausage in this 
version to highlight the flavors of the Islands we love &mdash; and now miss 
&mdash; so much. But we first discovered this recipe while living in Europe 
where we used the fish, seafoods and sausages we found there. Use whatever 
combination of seafoods and spicy sausage are local to you.</em> <br>
<br>
3/4 
lb. Kauai shrimp, with shell on<br>
(For hints on how to clean and de-vein 
shrimp with shell on, see Garlic Shrimp post )<br>
8-12 Big Island miniature 
abalone, cleaned and removed from their shells<br>
Options: also add 1/2 lb. of 
flaky fish fillets, such as snapper, salmon, cod or halibut, cut into 2&rdquo; 
pieces<br>
<br>
4 TBL. olive oil<br>
1 large onion, diced<br>
1 leek, cleaned 
and sliced<br>
1 TBL. fennel seed<br>
1/2 tsp. ground cinnamon<br>
1/2 tsp. 
ground allspicee, or 6 whole seeds<br>
1 tsp. ground cumin<br>
large pinch of 
saffron diluted in 1/4 cup hot water<br>
1 28 oz. can whole tomatoes, diced, 
reserve juice<br>
1 bottle dry white wine, reserve 1/2 cup<br>
1 cup clam juice 
or fish broth<br>
sea salt<br>
1 tsp. chili/garlic paste (Sriracha)<br>
1 blood 
orange or other orange, scrubbed well and sliced<br>
2 TBL. thyme<br>
2 sweet 
Italian sausages, or chouricos, sliced on the diagonal (we used half of one 
Hawaiian Portuguese sausage)<br>
6 firm waxy potatoes, boiled and sliced 
(optional)<br>
 (We opted out of the potatoes this time.)<br>
<br>
In a large 
Dutch oven, saute onions and leeks in oil over medium heat until onions are 
translucent, about 10-15 minutes. Add spices and turn heat up to medium-high. 
Fry together until spices are fragrant. Add saffron water and stir in.<br>
<br>

Add tomatoes, stir well, and cook together for 15-20 minutes, or until tomatoes 
darken in color. Add wine, broth, salt, chili/garlic paste, orange slices, 
thyme, and reserved tomato juice. Cover reduce heat to low, and simmer for 20 
minutes while you brown sausages.<br>
<br>
In separate skillet, brown sausage 
pieces, and add to simmering sauce as you remove them from the pan. Deglaze pan 
with reserved 1/2 cup wine, and add deglazing liquid to sauce. Simmer another 
15 minutes. (You can make the sauce up to this point and refrigerate for up to 
2 days. Like many sauces, it improves with time. Bring to a boil, then simmer 
for 15 minutes before finishing with the seafood or fish.)<br>
<br>
Just before 
serving, re-heat sauce and add shrimp and abalone. Cover and let simmer another 
5 minutes, or until shrimp is cooked through. Remove from heat immediately so 
abalone and shrimp don&rsquo;t overcook.<br>
<br>
If using potatoes, lay warm 
potatoes in serving dish, and cover with stew. Garnish with minced parsley or 
cilantro. Serve with lots of crusty bread to soak up the sauce.<br>

<h1>From Pupu to Pupusa...</h1>  September29 2008  November 13, 2008 <br>
This 
has been in the queue since the end of September... Getting back into the swing 
of preparing posts has been a challenge, but things are finally falling in 
place. Many thanks to everyone for your support and concern. One more belated 
post to come before we get up-to-date... Thanks for your patience...<br>
<br>
- 
Manju<br>
&ldquo;Cook food, but serve Love&rdquo; <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

&ldquo;Aloha Kakou&rdquo; from the beautiful, if muggy, Washington DC metro 
area! While no one guessed the actual place we are moving to, Laurie from 
Alaska guessed the closest city (she guessed Baltimore) and was named thewinner 
of the &ldquo;Three Tastes of Hawaii&rdquo; package. <br>
<br>
Yes, we&rsquo;ve 
finally landed and are still in the midst of finding a place to live, but we 
managed to sneak away for one day of sightseeing at the National Mall and the 
monuments, including the Washington Monument (seen here). It&rsquo;s been a 
long series of hotels and other temporary housing since mid-August, and that 
has been tiring, to say the least. The upside, of course, is we&rsquo;ve been 
planted in the midst of another landscape with wholly new (for us) culture and 
cuisines.<br>
<br>
But Washington DC is no ordinary metropolitan area &mdash; 
as the U.S. capital, it&rsquo;s the epicenter of transglobal palates and 
preferences, and we&rsquo;ve seen a little of that already.<br>
<br>
<br>
Here 
in the northern DC metro area we&rsquo;ve been introduced to 
&ldquo;Pupusa&rdquo; (seen at left, bottom of photo) &mdash; a flat cornmeal 
pocket filled with cheese, beans, meat or any combination of the three, that is 
a popular snack or side dish introduced by the large and thriving Salvodorean 
community here. &ldquo;Pupu,&rdquo; of course, is the word in Hawaiian for 
appetizers or hors d&rsquo;oeuvres, and we had our fair share ofpoke, sashimi, 
musubi, grilled sausage &amp; pineapple, and other island-style pupu during our 
time on Oahu.<br>
<br>
But we&rsquo;re not completely done with exploring 
Hawaii and her cuisine just because we&rsquo;re away &mdash; already 
we&rsquo;ve discovered Hawaiian-made Okinawan soba noodles, Hawaii shave ice, 
and Maui Tacos right here in this far, far corner away from the Islands. And 
because our notice to leave Oahu came rather abruptly, we still have a backlog 
of recipes using Hawaii local produce and ingredients yet to post. We also 
learned that the first U.S. franchise for that venerable piri-piri chicken 
empire,Nando&rsquo;s Chicken, has recently opened in downtown DC &amp;mdash 
(but they spell it<em>per-peri</em>); is it as good as the one we remember from 
London&rsquo;s Earl&rsquo;s Court? How does ourhomemade Piri-piri Chicken recipe
 stack up against its famous cousin? And how do they both fare against Peruvian 
rotisserie chicken? And speaking of more things from south of the border, there 
are no less than four types of South American soured cream in the grocery 
shelves around here &mdash; Salvadorean, Honduran, Mexican and Guatemalan 
&mdash; what&rsquo;s the difference and how do you use them? Can&rsquo;t wait 
to find out!<br>
<br>
We&rsquo;ve also seen that it will be much easier to 
refresh our pantry with Persian, South Asian, Middle Eastern and Mediterranean 
ingredients from local and specialty grocers in the area: sumac, Spanish and 
kalamata olives, sheep&rsquo;s milk cheeses, fresh methi leaves, apricot 
leather, pomegranate molasses, fufu... We&rsquo;ve also found a half dozen 
full-size or larger Korean supermarkets that are well-stocked with South 
American and South Asian ingredients, as well as Korean, Filipino and Japanese 
ingredients. What we can&rsquo;t seem to find is a well-stocked Japanese market 
&mdash; I&rsquo;m hoping for something akin toUwajimaya in the Pacific 
Northwest.<br>
<br>
As for our travel buddies, Haiku and Kiowea weathered their 
flight from Hawaii to DC (via Houston) well. For Haiku, it was old hat &mdash; 
in fact, she has now completely circumnavigated the globe! She and Laika lived 
with us in Boston, then flew across the Atlantic to Germany, then across Asia 
to Hawaii, and now Haiku has flown across the U.S. back to the East Coast! But 
for 3-year-old Kio, who was adopted in Hawaii, plane travel was quite a new 
experience! He seemed to have taken his cues from Haiku, though, and since she 
reacted calmly at the cargo center, he didn&rsquo;t panic when we dropped them 
off. Nor does he appear traumatized since we re-joined them here (they flew 1 
week before we did). In a later post, we&rsquo;ll talk about what steps we took 
to prepare them for their trip &mdash; both with homeopathic treatments and 
behavior training (yes, you can train a cat! ... in some things ...) We also 
have some tips for folks travelling to or from Hawaii with pets (we&rsquo;ve 
done both) &mdash; where you can stay with your pets, what airline will 
guarantee travel dates for your pets, etc.<br>
<br>
So many thanks to everyone 
who has checked in with us and let us know we&rsquo;re missed. I hope you bear 
with us through this hiatus, we&rsquo;ll be back soon...<br>

<h1>What we will miss...</h1>  August23 2008  There is an expression here, 
&ldquo;You lucky you live Hawaii&rdquo; &mdash; and it&rsquo;s true. And though 
we don&rsquo;t get to live here permanently, we know we are lucky to have spent 
so much time in Hawaii. And as that time draw to a close, we&rsquo;ve been 
thinking back on all the wonderful things we are already missing. Here are a 
few...<br>
<br>
<br>
Flowers blooming 365 days a year, but we&rsquo;ll 
especially miss the varieties of plumeria...<br>
<br>
<br>
View of the Koolaus 
and Diamond Head across Pearl Harbor<br>
<br>
<br>
View of the Waianaes when 
the morning sun highlights its ridges<br>
<br>
<br>
The brilliant colors of the 
sunrise...<br>
<br>
<br>
and sunsets... <br>
<br>
<br>
Rainbows <br>
<br>
<br>

Hiking through rainforests...<br>
<br>
<br>
...and along the knife edge ridges 
of the mountains (this is for T, I don&rsquo;t do heights)<br>
<br>
<br>

Hanging with some of the natives &mdash; these are monk seals, but also the 
honu (sea turtles)<br>
<br>
<br>
The incredible blue of the Pacific Ocean... 
<br> <br>
<br>
The oasis that is Foster Gardens in the middle hectic Honolulu 
<br> <br>
<br>
All the great fests, especially those at Kapiolani Park <br>
<br>
<br>Perfect shave ice with li ling powder on top and ice cream on the bottom at 
our local shop on Ewa<br>
<br>
<br>
Two of our neighbors: Friendly chirping 
house geckos, and this bulbul who adopted us and whom T nicknamed 
&ldquo;Bento&rdquo;<br>
<br>
<br>
All the lovely FRESH LOCAL PRODUCE.... <br>

<br> <br>
... and fresh, locally caught fish; as well as local beef, pork, 
eggs, milk, noodles, tofu, kamaboko,<br>
<br>
Everything talked about in the 
Hawaii Food Primer, but especially ramen, andagi, pickled li hing mango from 
Haleiwa, manapua, crack seed, poi, laulau, and Zippy&rsquo;s chili<br>
<br>

Some things we don&rsquo;t have photos of:<br>
<br>
- waking to the chatter of 
mynah birds, cardinals, bulbuls, half a dozen variety of finches, and doves at 
5:30 in the morning<br>
<br>
- watching the weekly procession of cattle egrets 
stalking a riding lawn mower (they eat the bugs the mower churns up) &mdash; 
the scene always reminds me of the fable of the &ldquo;Pied Piper of 
Hamelin&rdquo; with the mower in the lead, and wherever it drives, 12-20 large 
white egrets follow just behind!<br>
<br>
- the view of Kaneohe Bay as you come 
out of the tunnel on H-3 with the na pali on your left and that sheer drop off 
below the freeway (you feel like you&rsquo;re flying!)<br>
<br>
- and the view 
of Waialua and Haleiwa as you come over the crest on the Kam Highway, just 
before the road drops and your stomach falls before the rest of you catches up
<br> <br>
- the smell of barbecued meat in the air...at 7 in the morning! <br>

<br>- driving to the North Shore on Kunia Road, between corn fields, pineapple 
plantations and other farmland<br>
<br>
- being able to buy 20 lb. bags of rice 
at any grocery<br>
<br>
- bringing breakfast to the lagoons at Ko&rsquo;Olina 
to whale watch, spot turtles or seals, and spend a quiet morning<br>
<br>
- 
walking to the beach from home...<br>
<br>

<h1>A Crabby Meal</h1>  August19 2008 You might expect this to be about a meal 
of crabs &mdash; Dungeness or Snow, perhaps. Instead you&rsquo;re spying on 
this sand crab with me as he munches on his morning meal. He&rsquo;s only about 
4 inches long (or should I say, wide) and almost exactly the color of the 
surrounding sand. He sat just beyond my reach yesterday morning as I took our 
penultimate photo of the sunrise from this vantage point. When I realized he 
was eating, I turned my camera from the sunrise to him. He didn&rsquo;t seem to 
mind, as long as I didn&rsquo;t make any sudden movements. I dubbed him 
&ldquo;Kani-san&rdquo; (which is very un-original, it means Mr. Crab in 
Japanese).<br>
<br>
<br>
He is eating a small pod from one of the many shade 
trees around this beach park. I didn&rsquo;t even know crabs ate pods. Anyway, 
at first I assumed he was just carrying the pod somewhere until I noticed that 
he was making slicing motions with his claw along the length of the pod, not 
unlike a chef slicing fish...<br>
<br>
<br>
Then he would feed himself with one 
claw then the other...<br>
<br>
<br>
He even repositions the pod to reach 
deeper for the &ldquo;good stuff&rdquo; (I&rsquo;m guessing...)<br>
<br>
<br>

Then lowers the pod back to feed on the goodies, all the while keeping a wary 
eye on this rude intruder who is staring at him during his private time...<br>

<br> <br>
Mmmm.... more good stuff....<br>
<br>
<br>
This time he repositions 
himself instead of his food...<br>
<br>
<br>
Yeah, that&rsquo;s the gooey 
middle...<br>
<br>
<br>
After he slipped back into his hole, I couldn&rsquo;t 
resist taking a closer look at what he was eating (hey, maybe he was on to 
something, you know?). Yep, it&rsquo;s a pod... Do you think it might have any 
culinary value? Someone had to eat that first artichoke, right? (I did return 
it to Kani-san&rsquo;s hole after taking this picture)<br>
<br>

<p><br>
And this is the view he and I were enjoying &mdash; I with my coffee, 
<br>and Kani-san with his tree pod...<br>

<h1>Our Omnivore's 100</h1>  August18 2008 
<p><br>
Two of the Omnivore&rsquo;s 100: Sauerkraut and Saumagen <br>
(German 
version of Haggis, the pink patty on the right)<br>
</p> 
<p></p> <br>
I saw this today on Lulu&rsquo;s site at Mama&rsquo;s Taverna  as 
I made the rounds &mdash; it&rsquo;s a list of 100 things Andrew at Very Good 
Taste  thinks every omnivore should try at least once. It&rsquo;s a fun read 
and sort of a game: you post the list and highlight what you&rsquo;ve tried. 
Since we&rsquo;re in a holding pattern until we get where we&rsquo;re going 
next, this was a fun exercise. Brought back a lot of fond memories for us...<br>
<br> Andrew has a few rules if you want to join the fun:<br>
<br>
1) Copy this 
list into your blog or journal, including these instructions.<br>
2) Bold all 
the items you&rsquo;ve eaten.<br>
3) Cross out any items that you would never 
consider eating.<br>
4) Optional extra: Post a comment at 
www.verygoodtaste.co.uk linking to your results.<br>
<br>
You learn a lot about 
yourself and others in thinking about what you would or would not eat. One of 
my college psychology books said that all appetites are the same: intellectual, 
sexual, and gustatory! So what does this list tell you about your appetites??
<br> <br>
If you could add one thing to the list, what would it be? Mine would 
be Kombu , prepared the Okinawan way, of course!<br>

<h1>Random Musings...</h1>  August17 2008 <br>
<br>
It isn&rsquo;t called the 
Rainbow State for nothing... On the beach this morning to photograph the 
sunrise for the Sunrise Project , I turned away from the barely risen sun over 
the Koolau mountain range to find this intense spot of color to the west. Along 
with the two green sea turtles I saw bobbing around near shore in the choppy 
waters, this seemed an auspicious start for the day despite the rain. ( <em>
Happy Birthday, Mom!</em> )<br>
<br>

<h2>And the winner is...</h2> <br>
<br>
Laurie in Anchorage, Alaska! No one 
guessed the city exactly, but Laurie&rsquo;s guess came closest to our new 
destination. So the above goodies are on their way to Anchorage. Thanks to 
everyone who visited and who played along! And thanks to GL at Maine Musing! , 
who shares her adventures living in Maine on her site, for adding to the fun by 
throwing in extra prizes if any of her readers were the winner here!<br>
<br>

And speaking of Alaska, look who&rsquo;s back from his Alaskan summer vacation? 
Our part-year neighbor, this golden plover, or kolea, returned to our backyard 
on Thursday! He left in April and we weren&rsquo;t sure we would be here to see 
his return this fall. In April we took his photo just before he began his long 
flight north, knowing he would be leaving soon. The tell-tale sign is that his 
breast feathers become black ( see photo ) &mdash; then we know he will soon be 
on his way.<br>
<br>

<h2>What do you need?</h2> <br>
This week 98% of our household goods were 
packed and whisked away and we will not see them again until early October. For 
our last 2 weeks here and the next 6 on the other end, we will only have what 
will fit in 4 suitcases and about a dozen boxes we send via post. We will be 
staying in short-term rentals during this time, until we find something more 
permanent.<br>
<br>
So the question is: if you have to live for 2 months with 
only what you will carry with you, what do you bring to see your family through 
such a transition? What traditions or routines would be important to maintain? 
Assume you do not have family or other support on the other end, and you are 
limited to what you will bring with you.<br>
<br>
I was talking about this with 
a friend who lives in the U.K., and as I listed some of the things I had put 
aside, she listened quietly until I mentioned the rice cooker. &ldquo;Of 
course,&rdquo; she said, a smile in her voice &ldquo;the rice cooker.&rdquo; 
&ldquo;Yes, of course. Can&rsquo;t live without a rice cooker... but this is 
our transitional rice cooker, it only makes 3 cups of rice at a time. Our REAL 
rice cooker makes 10.&rdquo; Peals of laughter over the phone. <em>(Hi, Sophie!)
</em> <br>
<br>
Other must-brings include an electric water kettle (a habit I 
picked up in the U.K.), metal teapot and cups, coffee-drip filter and travel 
mugs, melamine (unbreakable) ramen bowls and plates, kitchen tongs, large 
skillet, 2-quart saucepan, small cast iron pan, wooden spoons ( <em>Kochloeffeln
</em> ), knives and sharpener, kitchen shears, can opener, corkscrew (actually, 
we just realized we did forget to pack this!), pillow, Dr. Bach&rsquo;s Rescue 
Remedy, large quantities of dark chocolate.<br>
<br>
I know many of you are or 
have been expats (living outside your country of birth) or spend a lot of time 
in other countries, so I&rsquo;m wondering what things were important to you to 
remind you of home, or to help you make the transition?<br>

<h1>Calamansi Margarita</h1>  August13 2008 
<p> <br>
</p> 
<p>It&rsquo;s another CLICK! event, and this time the theme is Citrus. The 
Jugalbandits are accepting entries until August 30th, so get out your cameras 
and join the citrus-scented fun...<br>
</p> <br>

<p></p> 
<p><br>
</p> 
<p>It&rsquo;s the King of Limes, in my book &mdash; Calamansi &mdash; also 
known as Kalamansi or Calamondin (<em>Citrofortunella microcarpa</em>). <br>

</p> <br>
<br>
It&rsquo;s flavor: a cross between lime and maybe a Seville 
orange, and as distinct as Key Lime or Wild Lime Leaves. If you&rsquo;ve never 
tried it, I&rsquo;m sorry. Really. You don&rsquo;t yet know what you&rsquo;re 
missing. It looks like a small round lime, but with the thin peel of a 
tangerine. In markets it may range in size from a Pfennig (smaller than a 
penny) to a half-dollar, and in color from mottled greens to pure orange, 
though its pulp is always a dark orange. The more orange the rind, the sweeter 
the juice will be; but it&rsquo;s never as sweet as its eponymously named 
cousins. We prefer the greener ones &mdash; after all, we want to take 
advantage of its lime-ier qualities.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Native to southeast 
Asia, calamansi trees can be found as popular ornamental trees far from their 
native lands. When we lived in Europe we had this potted tree to remind me of 
home, and from which we could pick fresh calamansi most of the year. They are a 
popular tree in the nurseries and garden shops (labelled 
&ldquo;Calamondin&rdquo;) in Europe, and they&rsquo;re raised in Tuscany (talk 
about being a long way from home!). I often wondered if anyone else buying 
these trees in Germany actually used the fruit as well. The glorious fragrance 
of both the fruit and leaves is extremely addictive, so be warned &mdash; try 
it once and you&rsquo;ll be hooked. I used to love to crush the leaves and 
place them in a bowl, especially in winter, for a hint of the coming spring.<br>
<br> <br>
Calamansi are ubiquitous in Philippine cuisine &mdash; and for me, 
<em>arroz caldo,</em> <em>pancit bihon</em>  and <em>bistek</em>  are just not 
the same without this distinctive flavor. Calamansi also makes the best limeade 
in the world &mdash; no, the universe! You can find a frozen limeade 
concentrate from the Philippines in some Asian markets &mdash; availability is 
spotty on Oahu, even at Pacific Supermarket, a dedicated Philippine supermart. 
Surprisingly, it was regularly available at the military commissary when we 
lived in Germany, so if you have access to an Air Force commissary (Army ones 
didn&rsquo;t always carry it), look in that frozen juice shelf more carefully.
<br><br>
Marvin at Burnt Lumpia  is doing some interesting experiments of his 
own using calamansi, and his infused vodka  inspired me to try my hand with my 
preferred poison (tequila, hold the worm) to make the ultimate limeade &mdash; 
a Calamansi Margarita. So after a long long long day of sorting, cleaning and 
packing, there&rsquo;s nothing better than a cool margarita on the beach to 
help one de-stress... and be thankful.<br>
<br>
<em>Bee, I have one for you, 
too, if you&rsquo;d care to join us... I&rsquo;d offer Jai one as well, but I 
don&rsquo;t want to be accused of bribing a judge!</em> <br>
<br>
<br>

CALAMANSI MARGARITA<br>
(adapted from epicurious.com )<br>
<br>
2 oz. Cuervo 
1800 Tequila<br>
1 oz. fresh calamansi juice<br>
splash Triple Sec<br>
1 tsp. 
raw sugar<br>
clear ice cubes<br>
coarse salt and calamansi for garnish<br>
<br>
Prep glass by rubbing rim with cut calamansi, then dipping edge in salt. Keep 
aside.<br>
<br>
Go to beach. Set up your beach chair. <br>
<br>
Shake all drink 
ingredients together. Fill glass with fresh ice. Pour cocktail into glass.<br>

<br>Enjoy with setting sun casting long shadows on Diamond Head in backdrop...

<h1>Lychee Sake Pork Stir-fry</h1>  August09 2008 
<p><br>
(Click on logo to learn more about the Buy Local campaign on the CTAHR 
site)<br>
</p> 
<p></p> <br>

<p></p> 
<p><br>
</p> 
<p>This dish came out of the happy chance of finding fresh local lychee just 
after we had opened a bottle of lychee-flavored sake from California to sample. 
I couldn&rsquo;t resist the temptation to put them together with locally 
produced pork loin and Chinese flat chives... and the result was unbelievably 
delicious. The pork is marinated briefly with garlic and rice vinegar to 
provide some punch to the dish, while the fresh fruit and sake lend their 
sweetness and a touch of elegance to the whole.<br>
</p> <br>
<br>
The lychee 
sake was interesting. It makes a nice after-dinner digestif, but it&rsquo;s not 
something we would want to drink with a meal. In this dish, it carried the 
lychee flavor to the meat during cooking and the overall effect was really 
quite charming. We found this sake at Don Quijote on Oahu, and would buy it 
again if we ever come across it in future.<br>
<br>
<br>
Lychee have a very 
mild but distinctive flavor. Although canned lychee are sweet and retain their 
fruit flavor, fresh lychee have a subtle but intense flavor that hits your 
palate before the more familiar regular lychee flavor settles in. If you can 
find fresh lychee, it&rsquo;s worth the minimal effort to peel and de-seed 
them! In a pinch, though, canned lychee can be used too.<br>
<br>
Although 
it&rsquo;s not local there, Germany was the place I first tried fresh lychee so 
I know it&rsquo;s available all around the Continent. So this is going out to 
Dhanggit at Dhanggit&rsquo;s Kitchen  for her little girl&rsquo;s first 
birthday event, Perfect Party Dishes . This recipe easily doubles or triples if 
you&rsquo;re making this for a crowd, but do each batch separately so the 
stir-fry doesn&rsquo;t &ldquo;steam&rdquo; &mdash; which is the rookie mistake 
I made this time around. You can also use regular sake, but you might want to 
add a bit of sugar, as the lychee sake has the mild sweetness of the fruit.<br>

<br>Addendum: Speaking of celebrations, just after I hit &ldquo;Publish&rdquo; 
we received word that a good friend of ours just made full colonel in the Air 
Force! As he and his wife are part-owners of a pork ranch (?... farm?) in Iowa, 
and they and their 2 boys are gourmands all, we have to include them in this 
dedication, too. Congratulations, Colonel designate Lindsey! We hope 
we&rsquo;ll be sharing meals like this with you all again soon...<br>
<br>
<br>

LYCHEE SAKE PORK STIR-FRY<br>
serves 4 <br>
Marinade for pork:<br>
1 lb. pork 
loin, cut into 1&rdquo; slices<br>
2 cloves garlic, minced<br>
2 tsp. rice 
vinegar<br>
sea salt<br>
ground black pepper<br>
<br>
Combine all ingredients, 
and set aside while you peel and seed lychees, or for at least 30 minutes.<br>

<br>2 lbs. fresh lychee (or 2 cans lychee)<br>
<br>
Peel and de-seed lychee, or 
drain cans well.<br>
<br>
To finish:<br>
2 TBL. peanut oil<br>
small handful of 
Chinese flat chives, garlic chives or ramps (Baerlauch)<br>
chili pepper 
flakes, to taste (optional)<br>
1/2 cup lychee sake (or regular sake + 1/2 tsp. 
sugar)<br>
dash of soy sauce<br>
<br>
Heat wok or large skillet over high heat 
to just below smoke point. Add oil, swirl, and immediately chives until their 
color darkens to bright green, about 30 seconds. Add chili flakes, if using, 
and pork and cook until pork browns.<br>
<br>
Move pork from center of pan, and 
add peeled lychee and sake. Fry together to warm fruit through and bring 
alcohol to a boil, about 1 minute. Add a splash of soy sauce, stir through and 
turn off heat. Taste and correct seasoning.<br>
<br>
We had this with steamed 
long-grain glutinous rice (malagkit), but it would also compliment the flavor 
of jasmine rice as well.<br>

<h1>Tequila &amp; Calamansi Marinated Flank Steak</h1>  August07 2008 
<p><br>
(Click on logo to learn more about the Buy Local campaign on the CTAHR 
site)<br>
</p> 
<p></p> <br>

<p></p> 
<p><br>
</p> 
<p>Among the many local produce and products that surprised us when we moved 
to Hawaii, local grass-fed, hormone-free, antibiotic-free beef was one of the 
best. With all the concern about the chemicals and pharmaceuticals that are 
pumped into commercially produced meats in the U.S., it is such a relief to 
find high quality beef raised right here in the Islands.<br>
<br>
Truth to 
tell, we were introduced first to Big Island beef on a visit there. We had 
heard that beef was raised on Oahu and the Big Island of Hawaii, but we 
didn&rsquo;t see it on market shelves. The only retail source seemed to be the 
Saturday Farmers&rsquo; Market near Diamond Head &mdash; and we had only been 
there once (it&rsquo;s a long haul from where we live). Anyway, on our second 
visit to the Big Island, we chanced upon a loco moco (rice topped with beef 
patty and egg, smothered in brown gravy...mmmm) that was made with Big Island 
grass-fed beef patties. OMG! The difference in flavor between beef we had known 
and grass-fed beef is the difference between fresh tuna and canned tuna &mdash; 
seriously, it is that much of a difference!<br>
<br>
We actually hand-carried 
several pounds of steaks and ground beef back to Oahu from that trip! Now that 
we were converted, we started looking more intently for grass-fed beef on Oahu, 
too. Happily we finally found a retail source closer to home &mdash; 
Tamura&rsquo;s Market in Wahiawa carries Oahu&rsquo;sNorth Shore Cattle Company 
grass-fed beef. A closer inspection of the frozen meat section of other 
retailers uncovered Big Island-produced Kulana Foods (couldn&rsquo;t find a URL 
for them) grass-fed beef at the Kokua Market co-op near the University.<br>
<br>
Why local beef? If the incredible flavor is not enough to win you over, 
consider the health benefits as well. Hawaii&rsquo;s local beef is leaner per 
pound, so less fat ends up on your plate and hips. And the cattle are not given 
hormones or antibiotics &mdash; both of which are absorbed and stored in the 
body.<br>
<br>
Lastly, Oahu-produced North Shore beef is not treated with 
carbon monoxide (aka &ldquo;tasteless smoke&rdquo;) &mdash; a color 
preservative used to keep meats and fish artificially &ldquo;red&rdquo; and 
&ldquo;fresh-looking.&rdquo; Carbon monoxide is intended to make meats look 
fresh and safe to eat long after some of the most harmful bacteria making the 
news today may be present, including<em>Clostridium botulinum, Salmonella, 
Campylobacter, and E-coli 0157:H7</em>. It&rsquo;s one of the reasons the use 
of carbon monoxide for meats and seafood is banned in the European Union, 
Japan, Canada and Singapore (read full article here).<br>
<br>
We received 
confirmation from North Shore Cattle Co. that they do not use carbon monoxide, 
and from what I remember of the Big Island beef, it does not look like it is 
treated either (if someone knows for sure, please comment or email us). So 
let&rsquo;s support local island producers who provide such high-quality 
additve-free meats. How can you tell whether carbon monoxide is used? The 
treated meat or fish (sadly, carbon monoxide is used a lot in ahi too) is 
bright mauve-red or cherry-red. Still unsure? Ask the butcher!<br>
<br>
OK, 
enough of the blah, blah, blah...<em>where&rsquo;s the beef?!</em> <br>
<br>
We 
recently grilled a Tequila and Calamansi Marinated Flank Steak made with North 
Shore beef and it was out of this world. The first thing I noticed about the 
flank steak when I took it out of the package is that it was so beautifully 
trimmed &mdash; very little to no &ldquo;silverskin&rdquo; (that thin membrane 
that surrounds the tissue in flank steak that will cause it to shrink and curl 
on itself when cooked). Also, flank is a notoriously &ldquo;un-tender&rdquo; 
piece of beef that requires either long marination and/or cutting across the 
grain to break it down to palatable chewiness, and so we did both. But when the 
meat was sliced after grilling, we marveled at how easily the meat cut compared 
to other flanks &mdash; it was smooth and tender. In fact, at the table we 
ended up cutting our beef with a fork instead a knife!<br>
</p> <br>
<br>

Whether or not you can find grass-fed beef, this marinade will put some sizzle 
into your next grill. Calamansi is a lime native to southeast Asia with a very 
distinct and addictive flavor that marries especially well with beef ( learn 
more ). In this marinade, calamansi and tequila not only infuse the steak with 
loads of rich flavor, they help tenderize it too. We are sending this, too, to 
Sig at Live to Eat , our host for the &ldquo;Grill It!&rdquo;  Monthly Mingle 
begun by Meeta at What&rsquo;s for Lunch, Honey . Although we didn&rsquo;t 
serve them together this time, this steak would pair well with our other entry 
for the &ldquo;Grill It!&rdquo; event, the Guam-style Grilled Eggplant Salad 
with Coconut Milk .<br>
<br>
<br>
TEQUILA &amp; CALAMANSI MARINATED FLANK STEAK
<br>This should serve 4-5 people<br>
<br>
(Marinate one day before grilling)<br>
1-1.25 lb (455-570g) flank steak<br>
3-5 cloves garlic, sliced lengthwise<br>
1 
oz. (30 ml or 2 TBL.) tequila<br>
1/4 cup (60ml) fresh calamansi juice<br>
1 
tsp. soy sauce, preferably Kikkoman<br>
1/2 tsp. sea salt (omit if using Aloha 
shoyu)<br>
1 tsp. ground black pepper<br>
<br>
Remove silverskin from flank 
steak, if necessary.<br>
<br>
<br>
Cut small slits across the grain on one side 
of steak. Insert slivers of garlic in each slit. Lay steak in glass or other 
non-metallic pan, or use a large recloseable plastic bag.<br>
<br>
Combine 
remaining ingredients, and pour over steak. Refrigerate ovenight.<br>
<br>
The 
next day, prepare your grill for direct heat cooking.<br>
<br>
Remove steak 
from fridge while grill is pre-heating. Take steak out of marinade and pat dry. 
Just before steak goes on the grill, sprinkle with sea salt, preferably alaea 
sea salt (red clay salt).<br>
<br>
Grill over high heat to desired doneness. 
Allow steak to rest for 5 minutes before cutting. Slice across the grain to 
serve. We served this with Salsa Rice and sauteed peppers and red onions.<br>

<p></p> 
<p><br>
You can see the marinated and cooked garlic slivers <br>
still 
embedded in the steak slices (we arm wrestle for these pieces!)<br>

<h1>On the road again...</h1>  August03 2008 UPDATE 08/17/08: The contest is 
now closed, and the winner has been sent an email requesting a mailing address. 
Many thanks to everyone for playing along, it was fun to track the guesses in 
the midst of all the chaos going on around here now.<br>
<br>
We&rsquo;re about 
to lose our internet connection and will be left to the whims of the internet 
gods for the remainder of our time here. We&rsquo;ll post when possible.<br>

<br>UPDATE 08/06/08: The prize package is on view here .<br>
<br>
Well, I guess 
reality is finally catching up with us and now it&rsquo;s time to share with 
everyone that we&rsquo;ll be on the move again. Three weeks from today 
we&rsquo;ll be on a plane to ...... ????? This is the question I&rdquo;m 
putting to you, &ldquo;Can you guess where we&rsquo;ll land next?&rdquo; In the 
last 11 years we&rsquo;ve lived in Germany twice, Boston once, and now Hawaii, 
but where is fickle Fate sending us next?<br>
<br>
To make this somewhat 
interesting (and, let&rsquo;s face it, less depressing for me), we&rsquo;re 
running a contest for the next 10 days. The first person to correctly guess our 
next destination will receive a tasting sample featuring some of our favorite 
flavors of Hawaii &mdash; l et&rsquo;s call it the &ldquo;Three Tastes of 
Hawaii&rdquo; (shameless self-promotion snuck in there!) sample pack.  Full 
details will follow when the package is assembled. If no one guesses correctly, 
the person who comes the closest will be deemed the winner (Google Earth/Maps 
is the arbiter; all decisions are final).<br>
<br>
A few hints: <br>
<br>
One, 
I can tell you that the place we&rsquo;re headed is somewhere between the 35th 
and 45th parallells North latitude. That&rsquo;s what the business with the 
maps is all about &mdash; the area between the shaky black lines is the area in 
play (you can see why cake decorating is not my thing!). If you&rsquo;re like 
me and you could use more concrete examples, check out the list on Wikipedia of 
world cities listed by their latitude . The city we&rsquo;re going to may or 
may not be on this list, but it might give you some places to start guessing.
<br> <br>
Two, I&rsquo;ll mention that this city is renown for a body of water 
located nearby and its many outdoor attractions.<br>
<br>
Three, I&rsquo;ll 
also mention that the reason we&rsquo;re moving is because of T&rsquo;s new job 
in this location and not because we plan to buy a house (as we had hoped) in 
this location.<br>
<br>
OK, that&rsquo;s enough to start the guessing. <br>
<br>
Now a few rules.<br>
<br>
1. Residents of Hawaii are not eligible &mdash; 
anyway, why would you want a sampling package of Hawaii, right?<br>
<br>
2. If 
you actually know where we&rsquo;re headed, please disqualify yourself &mdash; 
Sorry again, but that would be &ldquo;insider guessing.&rdquo; (Passing insider 
information will be frowned on too)<br>
<br>
3. Leave a comment below with your 
guess &mdash; emailed guesses will not count toward the contest.<br>
<br>
4. 
Please include an active email address in the comment form &mdash; we need it 
to contact you by August 17th if you&rsquo;re the winner. Because time will be 
of the essence, please reply to the email within 24 hours or we will be forced 
to move on to the next closest guesser.<br>
<br>
6. Only one entry per person 
please!<br>
<br>
If more than one person guesses correctly, only the first 
person with the correct guess will be deemed the winner so get your guess in 
early.<br>
<br>
Anyone outside the Hawaiian Islands with a valid postal address 
is encouraged to play. The tasting package will not be heavy so I&rsquo;m 
willing to mail it anywhere in the world that the U.S. postal system will 
accept (sorry, DHL and UPS are not in my budget).<br>
<br>
The winner will be 
contacted via email and the package sent before we leave, and our new hometown 
will be announced once we&rsquo;re on the ground there.<br>
<br>
I&rdquo;m 
having fun putting the sampler prize package together, and will post its 
contents soon.<br>
<br>
Good luck, Everyone! 0 Comments <br>

<h1>Creamy Ewa Sweet Corn Soup with Kauai Shrimp</h1>  July31 2008 
<p><br>
(Click on logo to learn more about the Buy Local campaign on the CTAHR 
site)<br>
</p> <br>
<br>
When you hear the words &ldquo;fresh corn,&rdquo; do 
you picture flat miles and miles of dark green stands of cornstalks in Iowa or 
Nebraska? I know we did, before we came to Hawaii. Now when someone mentions 
fresh corn, my mind immediately jumps to Ewa sweet corn, grown right down the 
road in the fertile Ewa Plains.<br>
<br>
Corn in Hawaii? I know, this was a 
complete surprise to us too. But your first taste of these tender sweet kernels 
will make you a believer too. And yes, the corn is grown by the same folks at 
Aloun Farms who also grow those wonderfulsweet onions and melons we&rsquo;ve 
looked at earlier. If you can believe it, there is a second corn grower on this 
small island &mdash; in Kahuku, on Oahu&rsquo;s North Shore (of surfing fame). 
Kahuku corn are also tender and sweet and, most importantly for Oahu, local 
fresh!<br>
<br>
When produce is this sweet and fresh, we don&rsquo;t usually 
mess with it too much &mdash; steam it or grill it, and eat it. They 
don&rsquo;t even need butter or salt. The key with sweet corn is that it must 
be cooked or frozen as soon as you get it home. A corn grower in California 
once told me that the sugars in corn begin to convert to starch as soon as they 
are picked from the stalk. Sugar = tender and sweet; Starch = chewy and kind of 
bland.<br>
<br>
At home, remove the husks and silk, then soak the corn cobs in 
a vinegar-water solution (2 TBL white vinegar for every 1 liter/quart of 
water), and rinse. Actually, for grilling you may want to keep some of the 
husks intact to use as protection from the flames (instead of wrapping in 
aluminum foil) or as a handle to pick up the corn. Just peel back the outer 
layers of the jusk (like peeling a banana) and leave them attached at the stem 
end. Remove the interior husks and the silks, then wash and rinse corn in their 
husks. Pull husks back over the corn (you can season the corn before 
re-husking), and they&rsquo;re ready for the grill!<br>

<p></p> 
<p><br>
An alternative method, popular in Japan and here in the Islands, is to 
grill the corn directly over the flame, seasoning with salt, pepper and a brush 
of soy sauce in the last minute of grilling. Delicious! You get sweet smoke 
with that hint of salty shoyu. This is a favorite festival food, but easy to 
recreate at home, too!<br>
<br>
We are fortunate to have more than one season 
for fresh corn on Oahu, and one of those seasons is going on now. With our 
fourth or fifth bag of corn this season, I finally decided to make something 
other than grilled or steamed corn. This is a thick and creamy soup that has no 
cream or milk &mdash; I really wanted the sweet flavor of the corn to be the 
star here. Its co-star is an equally sweet shrimp from a Neighbor Island 
&mdash; their flavors complemented each other perfectly.<br>
<br>
Fellow 
blogger Pomai atTasty Island commented on an earlier post that the use of place 
names (e.g., Ewa cantaloupe) not only promotes the freshness of the produce, 
but also increases the cachet of the final recipe to either impress one&rsquo;s 
guests or (if you&rsquo;re in the business) charge a fortune! He&rsquo;s 
absolutely right, of course. Wouldn&rsquo;t you pay $30 for thatLinguine with 
Ewa Cantaloupe Sauce in a Waikiki hotel?!<br>
<br>
So what did we do with the 
corn? Here I present you with Creamy Ewa Sweet Corn Soup with Kauai Shrimp (
more on the shrimp in a later post). That should fetch at least $20 as a first 
course, don&rsquo;t you think? The sea salad adds texture and another ocean 
element to the soup &mdash; we liked it a lot. The only thing I would say is 
next time I would cut the greens into smaller spoon-size pieces before 
garnishing.<br>

<br>
CREAMY EWA SWEET CORN SOUP WITH KAUAI SHRIMP<br>

Serves 4 as a first course<br>
<br>
6 ears Ewa (or Kahuku) sweet corn, washed 
as outlined above, some husk kept intact<br>
</p> <br>
<br>
Peel husk back from 
cleaned corn to use as a handle when cutting kernels from cob. Place top of 
corn ear into a deep wide bowl to catch the kernels. Using a sharp knife, cut 
down and away from you, into the bowl. Turn ear and continue cutting until all 
kernels are cut from cob. Remove husks and place in large dutch oven. Repeat 
with all cobs. Reserve kernels (you should have 5-6 cups kernels).<br>
<br>

Cover cobs with water, and bring to a boil. Boil for 20 minutes, and allow to 
cool completely.<br>
<br>
(Optional step: I was taught to extract as much 
flavor from my ingedients as possible, but some people will omit this step.) 
When cobs are cool enough to handle, remove from water. Place one cob end in 
water and using the BLUNT end of a knife, press down along the length of the 
cob into the water to release the last bits of corn. Repeat over the whole cob, 
and repeat for each cob. Pour &ldquo;broth&rdquo; into a measuring cup, and add 
water to measure 8 cups of liquid. Reserve corn broth/water.<br>
<br>
To finish 
soup:<br>
2 TBL. olive oil or butter (use butter if corn is frozen or starchy) 
<br>1 small onion, minced <br>
1/2 tsp. dried chervil <br>
1/4 cup mirin or sake
<br>sea salt, to taste <br>
ground white pepper, to taste <br>
1 lb. Kauai (or 
Kahuku) sweet shrimp, peeled and chopped (optional - reserve 1 tail per serving 
for garnish)<br>
sea salad (chopped) or marinated sea asparagus for garnish <br>
<br>Melt butter in dutch oven over medium heat. Add onion and cook until 
translucent, about 6-7 minutes. Add corn kernels and stir to coat with butter. 
Cover and cook for another 5-6 minutes. Add chervil, mirin, salt and white 
pepper, and stir through. Cook together 10 minutes. Remove 1/4 to 1/3 of the 
kernels (depending on how chunky you want the final soup to be &mdash; or leave 
them all in if you want a smooth soup).<br>
<br>
Add corn broth/water, and 
increase heat to high. Bring to a boil, then simmer for 15 minutes (add 
reserved shrimp tails to soup in the last 5 minutes, if using, and remove to 
separate plate to cool before blending soup). Taste and correct seasoning 
before pureeing.<br>
<br>
Use an immersion blender to puree soup. If you have 
to use a countertop blender, first cool the soup, then puree, and re-heat. HOT 
FOODS in a covered blender can &ldquo;explode&rdquo; from accumulated steam and 
heat. I don&rsquo;t recommend using a covered blender for any hot foods or 
drink.<br>
<br>
Return reserved kernels to soup and return to boil. Add chopped 
shrimp, lower heat to simmer, and cook for 2-3 minues, or until all shrimp turn 
pink and firm. Ladle into serving bowls, garnish with purchased sea salad and 
reserved shrimp tails.<br>

<h1>Sweet &amp; Tangy Beetgreens Sauce for Pasta</h1>  July30 2008 <br>
<br>

Whole fresh bunches of beets are a fleeting treat, so when we saw them 
recently, they were immediately snapped up. As much as we love beetroot, the 
greens and stalk stems are wonderful vegetables on their own. Granted, the 
stems lend more color and crunch than flavor to a meal, but they do readily 
take on strong flavors and hold them deeply. Usually I simply slice the stems 
on the diagonal and throw them in the wok, but this summer I&rsquo;ve been 
inspired by the ingenious and creative ways that Helen, at Food Storeies, has 
with vegetables! The woman handles a vegetable peeler with the skilled finesse 
of a sushi chef. Anyway, I opted to attempt to julienne the stalks, but found 
them very stringy and fibrous &mdash; this is why they are usually cut along 
the width, to cut the fibers down to edible size. But undaunted, and 45 long 
minutes later, the stalks were finally &ldquo;de-veined&rdquo; and julienned 
&mdash; they made quite a pretty picture with their deep burgundy color. But 
you can definitely skip this step and do the diagonal slices instead!<br>
<br>

<br> Beet greens are a mild, quick-cooking green that is suitable for 
stir-frying or simple flash-cooking, similar to spinach. They do have a slight 
musky quality that allows them to stand up to strong flavors, such as the 
vinegar and garlic in this pasta &mdash; which is actually derived from a 
southern Italian style pasta that features cauliflower. The combination of 
currants, garlic, and red wine vinegar with the vegetables will give you a 
sweet and tangy (sour) sauce. The addition of pork is my own twist, but 
certainly leave it out and you will have a fresh and colorful vegetarian pasta.
<br><br>
I&rsquo;ve been neglecting Dad&rsquo;s Gout Diet Challenge lately, but 
the vegetarian version of this recipe (no pork) with its healthy doses of 
greens, vinegar and garlic would be a nice change of addition to Dad&rsquo;s 
repetoire of gout-friendly recipes. So this will be included in the GDC .<br>

<br>SWEET &amp; TANGY BEETGREEN SAUCE FOR PASTA<br>
For 2 persons<br>
<br>

Stalks and greens from 6 beets<br>
<br>
Wash and rinse stalks and greens. Cut 
along both sides of each stalk to separate the greens. Roll the greens 
lengthwise and cut along the width into 1-inch pieces. Either slice the stalks 
in thin slices on the diagonal, or cut into 4-inch lengths, then de-vein each 
length (similar to cleaning celery fibers). Slice each length into 5-6 long 
pieces.<br>
<br>
3-4 cloves garlic, sliced<br>
2 TBL. + 1 TBL. olive oil<br>
3 
oz. (85g) lean pork, cut into slivers 1-inch long (optional)<br>
1/2 tsp. sea 
salt<br>
1/4 cup (40g) currants<br>
1 tsp. raw sugar<br>
1/3 cup (80ml) red 
wine vinegar<br>
12 oz. dried pasta<br>
<br>
Start water for pasta.<br>
<br>

Heat first 2 TBL. oil in large skillet (large enough to hold pasta too) over 
medium heat. Add garlic, and cook until fragrant and lightly browned. Add pork, 
if using, and cook until browned, about 4-5 minutes. Add beet stalks and salt, 
and stir well to coat with oil. Cover pan and allow to cook until stalks begin 
to wilt, about 3 minutes. Increase hat to medium-high, and add beet greens and 
1 TBL oil, cover and cook for 5 minutes. Remove cover and sprinkle sugar and 
currants over greens, stir through. Make a hole in the center of the greens, 
and pour vinegar in hole. Stir everything through, and allow to cook for 
another 8-10 minutes or until greens are bright green and softened. Taste and 
correct seasoning, and keep sauce warm until pasta is cooked.<br>
<br>
Salt 
water and add pasta &mdash; cook to al dente. Drain well but do not rinse. Add 
pasta to sauce. Increase heat under skillet to medium-high, and stir through to 
combine pasta and sauce ingredients. Serve in warmed bowls/plates, garnish with 
squeeze of lemon, if desired.<br>

<h1>Okra &amp; Corn Stew with Jerk Salmon</h1>  July28 2008 <br>
Okra. 
It&rsquo;s one of those &ldquo;bright line&rdquo; foods &mdash; you either love 
it or you really, re-e-ally don&rsquo;t. I only crossed over to the &ldquo;love 
it&rdquo; camp as an adult, and now I&rsquo;m firmly entrenched there. In 
Hawaii we&rsquo;re lucky to find fresh okra most of the year, but because 
it&rsquo;s a vegetable that doesn&rsquo;t hold well when fresh, we still often 
have a bag of frozen okra in the freezer so we can make this ultra-easy Okra 
&amp; Corn Stew.<br>
<br>
<br>
In fact, it was this stew that bridged the way 
for me to cross into the okra-loving camp. A friend in college whipped this up 
in seconds from frozen and canned components and then let it simmer for an hour 
or so while we worked with our study group. At the end of the hour, a purchased 
bucket of fried chicken and biscuits rounded out our meal and four hungry, 
harried students were happily sated. To be honest, at first I balked at the 
sight of okra with the corn and tomatoes, but my friend dared me to &ldquo;just 
one taste.&rdquo; I&rsquo;ve been hooked ever since, and when I make this stew, 
it&rsquo;s always exactly as she told me how to do it.<br>
<br>
As much as we 
advocate fresh local produce, there is still a place for frozen produce in our 
pantry too. Vegetables that have been minimally processed and left 
&ldquo;naked&rdquo; (no seasonings or other ingredients added) are frozen 
staples that allow us to prepare dishes we love when time is a premium. The 
okra in this photo is of thawed frozen okra.<br>
<br>
Another favorite dish at 
our house in which okra plays a prominent role is a Filipino vegetable stew 
called <em>pinakbet</em> , but for some reason, we couldn&rsquo;t imagine 
making that dish with frozen okra. For some reason that dish seems to require 
fresh okra pods, especially smaller ones. But I digress...<br>
<br>
Here Okra 
&amp; Corn Stew is paired with jerked fish fillets, made with a purchased jerk 
seasoning and frozen Alaskan sockeye salmon. The salmon are just browned in a 
separate pan, then added to the stew to finish cooking. The spicy fish fillets 
contrast with the sweetness of the stew for a satisfying, no-fuss meal. Of 
course, my favorite pairing with this stew will always be fried chicken!<br>

<br> <em>For Cari</em> <br>
<br>
<br>
OKRA &amp; CORN STEW WITH JERK SALMON<br>

for 4 persons<br>
For the fish:<br>
4 4-6oz. (113 - 170g) fillets of Alaskan 
sockeye salmon (or halibut, or snapper)<br>
Purchased jerk seasoning powdered 
rub<br>
Juice of 1 lime<br>
sea salt<br>
<br>
Pat fillets dry. Sprinkle with 
lime juice, then coat both sides of fish with jerk rub. Allow to marinate while 
you start the stew.<br>
<br>
For the stew:<br>
1 bag frozen cut okra (1 lb/450g)
<br>1 bag frozen sweet corn (1 lb/450g)<br>
1 15oz (425g) can diced tomatoes 
(we use Muir organic from Costco)<br>
1/2 tsp. dried oregano<br>
1/2 cup 
(120ml) water or broth<br>
sea salt, to taste<br>
ground black pepper, to taste
<br><br>
Combine all ingredients in a skillet (large enough to hold all the 
fish fillets too). Bring stew to a boil, then cover and reduce heat to a 
simmer. Allow to simmer for 45 minutes to 1 hour, depending on how well you 
like your okra done.<br>
<br>
After the stew has simmered for 30 minutes, 
pre-heat a second skillet for the fish. Season fish fillets with salt to taste 
(remember the stew has salt too). Add oil, then fish to the pan and allow the 
seasonings to brown (it will look like Cajun blackened fish), about 2 minutes. 
Brown the other side of the fillets (they will not be cooked through).<br>
<br>

Check stew and correct seasoning, adding a little water or broth if it looks 
dry. Add fish on top, just below the surface of the stew. Cover and cook for 
the last 10 minutes.<br>
<br>
Serve with biscuits or garlic bread. <br>

<h1>Grilled Eggplant Salad in Coconut Milk</h1>  July27 2008 
<p><br>
(click on logo to learn more on the CTAHR site)<br>
<br>
</p> <br>
<br>
During our celebration of Guam&rsquo;s Liberation Day last week, our fiesta 
plate with Red Rice and Guam BBQ Chicken  was served with this grilled salad of 
eggplant in a spicy lemon and coconut marinade, called <em>Finadene Birenghenas
</em>  in Guam&rsquo;s native language, Chamorro (from <em>Leblon Finatinas 
para Guam</em>  [Guam Cookbook]). The best eggplant for this salad are the long 
thin Oriental eggplant seen here. These can be found in abundance in the 
Islands most of the year. Off-island, Asian markets will usually carry them.<br>
<br>When we lived overseas, I often longed for these thin-skinned and quick 
cooking eggplants, which do not require skinning or salting as their round 
Continental cousins might. Our favorite way to prepare them is to grill them. 
Whenever we grill, T will also throw on 5-6 of these beauties even when they 
will not be part of that day&rsquo;s meal. Once cooled, the eggplants are 
peeled and ready in the fridge for a variety of future salads and meals. When 
peeling, avoid the temptation to rinse the eggplants under running water 
&mdash; rinsing will wash out much of the prized smoke flavor in the vegetable. 
This is true for all grilled or char-broiled vegetables you peel before using, 
such as bell peppers or tomatoes.<br>
<br>
I think of this dish as a salad, but 
it&rsquo;s not the kind of salad you would want to eat alone. Usually this is 
served as part of rice meal with barbecued or roasted meats and seafood, 
although I love it with just a big scoop of red rice and finadene sauce, too. 
The smoky flavor of the grilled eggplant is first tamed with the sweet coconut 
milk, then lifted with the lemon juice and peppers. It is surprisingly 
light-tasting and refreshing, despite its seemingly heavy ingredients. If you 
already like the smoky, meaty flavor of eggplants in <em>baba ghanoush, </em> 
you might enjoy the variation on that flavor which this salad will bring to 
your table <em>.</em> <br>
<br>

<p></p> 
<p><br>
This recipe is going out to the award-winning Sig at Live to Eat, who 
is hosting the&ldquo;Grill It!&rdquo; event for the Monthly Mingle begun by 
Meeta atWhat&rsquo;s for Lunch, Honey? Grill fever can&rsquo;t help but sweep 
the northern Hemisphere while the short weeks of summer are in full swing, and 
I hope this delicious salad will too!<br>
<br>
GRILLED EGGPLANT SALAD IN 
COCONUT MILK (<em>FINADENE BIRENGHENAS</em>)<br>
Adapted from <em>Leblon 
Finatinas para Guam</em> [Guam Cookbook]<br>
For 3-4 servings<br>
<br>
6-7 
large thin eggplants (about 1.5 lbs/680g)<br>
oil to coat eggplant<br>
<br>

Pre-heat grill.<br>
<br>
With a sharp knife, pierce skin of each eggplant in 
4-5 places to prevent the eggplants from bursting while on the grill. Lightly 
coat each eggplant with olive oil.<br>
<br>
Place eggplants over high heat to 
char, and cook until eggplant is completely soft, with no spongy areas (spongy 
= still not cooked through). Time will depend on the size of the vegetables. 
Remove from heat and allow to cool enough to handle. Holding the stem end, 
remove peel by pulling downwards &mdash; peel should come away easily, leaving 
the vegetable flesh intact. Once eggplants are peeled, they can be refrigerated 
3-4 days for later use.<br>
<br>
To finish salad:<br>
1/2 to 1 onion, sliced 
thinly<br>
Juice of 1 lemon<br>
sea salt to taste<br>
ground black pepper, to 
taste<br>
1-3 donne peppers, aka Thai bird chilies (optional)<br>
1/2 cup 
coconut milk<br>
scallions for garnish<br>
<br>
Combine onions, lemon, salt, 
peppers, and coconut milk. Allow to sit for 30 minutes while you prepare 
eggplants.<br>
<br>
Cut peeled eggplants crosswise into bite-size chunks. Taste 
coconut milk mixture and correct for salt, if necessary &mdash; it sould be 
lemony and slightly sweet. Add eggplants and gently combine to distribute 
flavors. Garnish with green onion rings.<br>
<br>
Serve with roasted or grilled 
meats and seafood, and rice. (Serve withRed Rice and Guam BBQ Chicken for a 
real Guam fiesta experience.)<br>

<h1>5-A-Day: Choi Sum </h1>  July23 2008 
<p><br>
(Click on the logo for another choi sum recipe)<br>
</p> 
<p></p> <br>
It&rsquo;s no secret that we&rsquo;re big fans of all the local 
greens around here &mdash;watercress , Chinese mustard cabbage (gai choy) , and 
 fiddleheads (warabi)  have been touched on earlier. Two other versatile and 
highly nutritious locally grown vegetables are choi sum (Brassica 
parachinensis) and Chinese broccoli, or gai lan (Brassica oleracea), both also 
members of the cabbage family.<br>
<br>
At the markets these two are sometimes 
confused for the other &mdash; shoppers looking for Chinese broccoli will pick 
up choi sum, and vice versa. Both vegetables have long stems with large 
lobe-shaped leaves and flowers at the end. The trick to telling them apart is 
that Chinese broccoli has thick, waxy-looking stems and leaves, and white 
flowers (right); while choi sum stems and leaves look more tender, and it has 
dark yellow flowers (left). When the flowering tip of Chinese broccoli is 
tightly closed, it can also be confused with its Continental cousin, broccoli 
rabe or <em>rapini </em> &mdash; but broccoli rabe has serrated leaf edges ( 
photo on Wikipedia ).<br>
<br>
Chinese broccoli stems and flowers are similar 
in flavor to western broccoli; but it has the added nutritional value of having 
edible leaves as well. Chinese broccoli requires some peeling and sorting 
(stems from leaves) after washing, and so requires some extra prep work before 
cooking. We&rsquo;ll take a closer look at it soon.<br>
<br>
For now, 
let&rsquo;s just focus on choi sum. Every part of choi sum is edible, and the 
stems are relatively soft and fast-cooking so whether you separate the stems 
from the leaves or leave it whole will depend on what you want to do with the 
vegetable. One of the easiest and most versatile ways to prepare choi sum is to 
simply steam the entire bunch. Once steamed, the vegetable can be kept in the 
fridge for 3-4 days until needed. It can be served cold with a sesame  or other 
dressing, or re-heated with pan sauce such as the Spicy Garlic Sauce below.<br>

<br>We also like to use choi sum greens in fried noodle dishes, including 
Japanese yakisoba and Korean chap chae. In this case, separate the leaves from 
the stems/flowers. Now you can julienne the leaves for the noodles and steam 
the stems whole for a separate vegetable dish. We recently made chap chae using 
choi sum leaves already steamed in a bunch &mdash; the cooked leaves were 
simply separated, then added after the meat and other vegetables were cooked 
too.<br>
<br>
Choi sum is a very mild-tasting green when cooked (similar to 
spinach), and easily absorbs dressings, sauces and aromatics around it. It has 
none of the bitterness that watercress, mustard cabbage or other similar greens 
have, so it&rsquo;s a good choice for someone who might be exploring Asian 
greens for the first time. It is also easy to clean and prep, and cooks fast 
which also make it a great candidate as a &ldquo;gateway vegetable.&rdquo;<br>

<br>As with any vegetable, organic or not, a good bath in a vinegar-water 
solution (2 TBL. vinegar for every 1 quart/liter water) and several rinses with 
cool water is a good way to start. Trim any discolored or questionable parts, 
then lay in a prepared steamer once the steam is at its peak (careful not to 
burn yourself). Cover and allow to steam for about 4-5 minutes, then 
immediately remove from steamer onto a large plate to cool &mdash; spread stems 
into a single layer on the plate. It should be a dark vibrant green, and the 
stems almost translucent. Once the greens are cool enough to handle, bring into 
a bunch and gently squeeze out excess moisture &mdash; you don&rsquo;t want to 
wring it dry, just keep it from being dripping wet. These photos show the 
cooked vegetable after cooling, but before (left) and after (right) squeezing.
<br> <br>
Now you&rsquo;re ready to have your way with them! Cut into 
chopstick-friendly pieces, they can grace the top of your saimin/ramen soup; 
drizzled with sesame or citrus dressing it&rsquo;s a quick and delicious side 
dish to any meal; chopped up and scrambled with eggs or quiche it&rsquo;s a 
nice change from spinach; or top it off with this spicy garlic-rich sauce if 
you really want to kick it up a notch!<br>
<br>

Fresh&rdquo; campaign also have a soup recipe using fresh choi sum, just click

SPICY GARLIC SAUCE FOR 
GREENS<br>
For one pound of choi sum, watercress, or warabi (or any hearty 
green)<br>
<br>
4-5 cloves of garlic, chopped<br>
2 TBL. olive oil<br>
1 tsp. 
raw sugar<br>
1-3 tsp. sriracha chili sauce<br>
1-1/2 TBL. fermented soy beans 
(dao jiao), mashed with a fork<br>
1 TBL. soy sauce<br>
2 TBL. Thai-style fish 
sauce (or patis, less if using a Vietnamese brand)<br>
2 TBL. rice, coconut or 
apple cider vinegar<br>
1/2 cup water<br>
1 TBL. cornstarch dissolved in 1/4 
cup water<br>
ground black pepper<br>
<br>
1 lb. of cooked choi sum or other 
green<br>
<br>
In a wok or large skillet, cook garlic in oil over medium heat 
until garlic is fragrant. Sprinkle with sugar and mix through. Add sriracha, 
mashed soy beans, soy sauce, fish sauce, vinegar, and water, and mix well to 
combine. Increase heat to medium high and allow mixture to come to a boil. Turn 
heat back down to medium, add cooked greens, and simmer for 5 minutes.<br>
<br>

Make a hole in the center of wok/pan, and add dissolved cornstarch to center. 
Cook until sauce thickens, and coat greens with sauce.<br>
<br>
Remove greens 
to serving plate, and pour sauce over. We had this as a side dish with the 
Kasu-marinated Butterfish  last month.<br>

<h1>Guam Fiesta Plate: Red Rice, BBQ Chicken &amp; Finadene</h1>  July21 2008 
<p><br>
</p> 
<p>Happy Liberation Day, Everyone! Yes, today is a territorial holiday in my 
hometown &mdash; marking the day in 1944 when Marine troops stormed the shores 
of Asan beach and began the liberation of Guam from Japanese occupiers during 
World War II. It&rsquo;s a day of parades and, of course, barbecues everywhere 
&mdash; and I don&rsquo;t just mean on Guam. The Guam diaspora has spread these 
flavors all over the world. At one point, the largest community of Guamanians 
outside of Guam was in Germany &mdash; no kidding! (Check out thecoverage of 
this year&rsquo;s festivities here from Guam&rsquo;s own <em>Pacific Daily News
</em>.) <br>
</p> <br>
<br>
And barbecues on Guam feature some uniquely 
prepared foods &mdash; most notably Red Rice, lemon-shoyu BBQ Chicken (short 
ribs and pork spare ribs too if you&rsquo;re feeding a gang), and a condiment 
called <em>Finadene</em>  (fin-ah-DEN-ee). A typical fiesta barbecue plate is 
shown here with a eggplant salad in coconut milk  (in bowl) and pickled 
cucmbers.<br>
<br>
Guam&rsquo;s red rice is truly unique. Whereas other 
red-colored rice dishes will get their color and flavor from tomatoes (fresh or 
paste), or even beets, this red rice is flavored and colored with achiote seeds 
(also called annatto or atsuete). The seeds are soaked in water, and the 
strained soaking liquid is used to cook the rice. Many people will add a tiny 
bit of salt and oil, as well, but after that everyone will have their own 
variations of what else, if anything, will be included &mdash; onions, peas, 
bacon or broth are some of the most common additions.<br>
<br>
I&rsquo;ve never 
seen any other cuisine use achiote water to cook rice &mdash; it lends a unique 
and ineffable flavor. Yestereday T and I tried to think of a way to describe 
the flavor of achiote-flavored rice to someone who was unfamiliar with achiote. 
&ldquo;Earthy&rdquo; &ldquo;Smoky&rdquo; &ldquo;Meaty&rdquo; &ldquo;Like beans 
that have been pureed&rdquo; was the closest we could come, but none really 
hits the mark (that last one was T&rsquo;s &mdash; pretty creative description, 
I thought). One thing I can tell you, I&rsquo;ve never met a person who tried 
it and didn&rsquo;t like it. Usually when you tell someone you&rsquo;re from 
Guam, if they&rsquo;ve known someone from Guam before, they will either ask you 
for your finadene, red rice and/or chicken recipe. That&rsquo;s how these 
recipes are &mdash; you try them once and they stick with you and make you 
crave your next taste of it.<br>
<br>
The recipes below are for what might be 
considered the holy trinity &mdash; the absolute basics &mdash; of a Guam 
barbecue (aka fiesta) plate. You&rsquo;ll want to make all three if 
you&rsquo;re going to make one. Trust me, these flavors were born to go 
together. The chicken marinade seems ridiculously simple, and it is &mdash; you 
just can&rsquo;t believe how good this basic recipe is until you smell it on 
the grill. Charcoal is best, but even a gas grill will work (that&rsquo;s what 
we have.... *she ducks as coconuts are thrown from Guam*).<br>
<br>
And the 
best thing is that there are no especially hard-to-find ingredients. The 
achiote seeds may not be part of your pantry staples, but on Oahu, you can find 
seeds in the Asian (Filipino) or Hispanic section of most supermarkets. 
Elsewhere in the U.S. and the world, look in Hispanic markets and Asian 
groceries for the whole seeds.<br>
<br>
At a real Guam fiesta, you will see 
many, many, many, MANY more dishes than these three, but these are your 
building blocks. And no, you don&rsquo;t have to wait for the next Liberation 
Day festivities to try this. You can bring the flavors of Latitude 13 North to 
where you live any time (that&rsquo;s where the island is, Folks, it&rsquo;s 
not in the south Pacific)! For another take on these recipes, check out the 
Betty Shimabukuro&rsquo;s full-page spread on Guam cuisine  in last week&rsquo;s
<em>Honolulu Star-Bulletin</em> .<br>
<br>
If you know Red Rice, how would you 
describe its flavor to someone who had never tried it??<br>
<br>
<br>
RED RICE
<br>for 4 persons<br>
<br>
1/2 cup achiote seeds<br>
2 cups water<br>
<br>
Soak 
achiote seeds in water for 2 hours.<br>
<br>
Wash hands well, then use hands to 
rub seeds together to release more color from the seeds. Water will be a dark 
red, muddy color. So will your hand. Achiote is used as a dye and food coloring 
agent (guess what colors your Cheddar cheese?) so it stains easily and deeply. 
I&rsquo;ve taken to using a latex glove when rubbing achiote seeds for this 
dish &mdash; wash your hands WITH the glove on to rid the glove of its powder 
coating before handling seeds.<br>
<br>
Strain water to catch all the seeds 
(the seeds don&rsquo;t dissolve when cooked... ha ha... inside joke) into a 
measuring cup. Top up with water, if necessary, to measure 2 cups. Set aside 
until needed.<br>
<br>
1 medium onion, diced<br>
3 TBL. olive oil<br>
<br>
Cook 
onions in oil over low heat, until translucent and sweet, about 10-12 minutes.
<br><br>
2 cups medium-grain Calrose rice, washed and rinsed until water is 
clear<br>
1 tsp. salt<br>
<br>
Place washed rice in rice cooker. Add salt, and 
cooked onions, including oil. Add achiote water, and gently stir through. Allow 
to sit for 10 minutes.<br>
<br>
Turn on rice cooker. When cooker turns itself 
off, do not open lid for at least 15 minutes.<br>
<br>
Using a rice paddle or 
wooden spoon, turn rice over to distribute the cooked contents evenly. Bring 
paddle down to the bottom of the pot, and turn the contents over so the rice on 
the bottom (it will be darker colored than the rest) is on top. Gently break up 
this chunk of rice, releasing steam. (The motion is similar to folding egg 
whites into a batter &mdash; cut, turn and gently distribute.) Continue this 
motion all around the pot until the everything is evenly mixed through and the 
steam realeased.<br>
<br>
<br>
GUAM-STYLE BBQ CHICKEN<br>
for 4 persons<br>
<br>
1 large whole chicken, cut into quarters<br>
2 whole lemons<br>
1 cup soy sauce
<br>1 tsp. sea salt<br>
1 tsp. ground black pepper<br>
1 medium onions, sliced 
(optional)<br>
<br>
Place chicken, skin-side down in large non-reactive bowl. 
Combine other ingredients and pour over chicken. Marinate overnight in fridge.
<br><br>
Prepare your grill or charcoal barbecue. An hour before it goes on the 
grill, remove chicken from fridge and allow to come to room temperature.<br>

<br>Place chicken skin-side down on grill. After 20 minutes, turn over and cook 
another 20-30 minutes, depending on the cut &mdash; breast pieces will take 
longer. Test by cutting near the joint to make certain the juices run clear. 
Cut into serving pieces and serve with red rice and finadene.<br>
<br>
<br>

FINADENE<br>
Everyone will have their preferred proportions of lemon juice to 
soy sauce &mdash; we like a really strong lemon flavor over soy. We 
didn&rsquo;t have cherry tomatoes this time, but usually we put those in our 
finadene too.<br>
<br>
Juice of 2 lemons<br>
1/2 medium onion, sliced thin<br>

3 stalks of green onion, sliced (optional)<br>
6-10 cherry tomatoes, halved 
(optional)<br>
1/2 cup soy sauce<br>
1/2 tsp. sea salt, or to taste 
(you&rsquo;ll need less if you use more soy sauce than we do)<br>
1-5 <em>donne 
peppers</em> , aka Thai bird chiles, sliced or left whole depending on your 
heat tolerance<br>
<br>
Combine all ingredients, and let stand at least 2 hours 
before serving. Use on all kinds of meats and grilled vegetables. This is not 
for barbecues only &mdash; finadene is a staple condiment that will spice up 
any meal.<br>

<h1>New Worlds of Flavor Learned from You</h1>  July14 2008 My husband calls 
me a &ldquo;food evangelist&rdquo; because whenever I find a truly delicious 
new food, I want the whole world to share the love. Lately we&rsquo;ve been 
sampling quite a few great recipes from fellow food bloggers, and the three 
featured below have all been sampled more than once and added to our 
&ldquo;Keeper&rdquo; recipe file.<br>
<br>
All we ardent food lovers can fall 
into the &ldquo;rut&rdquo; of reading our fellow bloggers&rsquo; recipes and 
thinking, &ldquo;That sounds like this or that other recipe I&rsquo;ve 
tried&rdquo; and perhaps not venture to actually sample what has been offered. 
I know I do that, too. But sometimes someone&rsquo;s description or method or 
humor captures our attention. We try the recipe. We&rsquo;re surprised. And 
delighted. We&rsquo;ve learned something new. A nuance has been added, a 
revelation is internalized.<br>
<br>
<br>

<h2>CHICKEN INASAL</h2> <br>

<p><br>
</p> 
<p>The first time I saw coconut vinegar on the shelves at the Philippine 
supermarket here, I considered getting a bottle but we already had 10 different 
vinegars in the pantry so I actually passed it over. For three years. Then I 
saw what Marvin over atBurnt Lumpia made with coconut vinegar. He took the 
ubiquitous beer-can chicken and made it his own with his Chicken Inasal 
marinade and basting oil. We had never heard of &mdash; much less tasted 
&mdash; the regular chicken inasal, a marinade of coconut vinegar, calamansi 
juice, brown sugar, lemongrass, garlic, and ginger popular in the Philippines. 
And so the coconut vinegar finally made it&rsquo;s way into the shopping cart.
<br><br>
Marv&rsquo;s chicken inasal marinade creates an incredible melange of 
flavors, especially when the whole thing is basted with achiote (aka achuete or 
annatto) oil! The coconut vinegar is mildly acidic &mdash; on par with rice 
wine or balsamic vinegars &mdash; but it gives the chicken a definite tang that 
you know right away is not plain vinegar. I don&rsquo;t know if you could 
substitute a different vinegar and get the same sweetness and bite, so for this 
recipe, coconut vinegar will be a pantry staple too.<br>
<br>
We used 
Marv&rsquo;s marinade with chicken parts, rather than a whole chicken as he did 
in the grilled beer-can chicken fashion. We&rsquo;ve used this recipe 3 times 
already; the last time we made it, the chicken was broiled in the toaster oven 
(photo) rather than grilled. Still tasted great with sticky rice and Evil 
Jungle Prince style veggies! For hisrecipe and photos of beer-can chicken (for 
the uninitiated), check it out here.<br>
<br>
<br>
</p> 
<h2>METHI PAKODAS</h2> <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Having fallen in love with the 
smoky, resinous flavor of dried methi, or fenugreek, leaves when we tried 
Fingerling Potatoes with Fenugreek  at Easter, I&rsquo;ve had my radar up for 
other recipes with methi leaves. Mansi at Food and Fun  shared a recipe for her 
pakodas with fresh methi leaves. I asked her if I could use the dried leaves, 
since our grocer was often out of fresh, but she recommended frozen leaves 
instead. Never knew it was an option &mdash; but sure enough, they were there.
<br><br>
Pakodas (sometimes also spelled pakoras) are the Indian equivalent of 
Japanese tempura, but made with a highly seasoned batter made of chickpea 
flour, or <em>besan</em> . It&rsquo;s one of our favorite first courses when 
we&rsquo;re lucky enough to be in an Indian restaurant. Usually, vegetables 
such as cauliflower, mushrooms, carrots, or an assortment are dipped in batter 
and fried. This version produces a more dumpling-like pakoda, as tablespoonsful 
of brilliantly-speckled batter are fried until golden brown.<br>
<br>
The 
&ldquo;fresh&rdquo; methi leaves really do taste different than when 
they&rsquo;re dried &mdash; the pakodas had a fresh, almost minty flavor. We 
couldn&rsquo;t quite place what the flavor reminded us of, until we were into 
our second fritter &mdash; it was eucalyptus! There&rsquo;s a suggestion of 
fresh eucalyptus leaves in the aroma. Served with a tamarind chutney, it makes 
a great appetizer. Or part of a appetizer grazing meal, paired with the next 
recipe &mdash; which is what we did. Get Mansi&rsquo;s recipe and instructions 
here .<br>
<br>
<br>

<h2>KEFTEDES</h2> <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Don&rsquo;t make the mistake of thinking 
these are mere meatballs because they&rsquo;re anything but. A more fitting tem 
would be &ldquo;meat pillows&rdquo; because that&rsquo;s exactly what came to 
mind when I first bit into these hot little cuties. It was Lulu&rsquo;s, at 
Mama&rsquo;s Taverna , description of Keftedes that was so intriguing:<br>

<blockquote> 
<p>&ldquo;These weren&rsquo;t meatballs so much as they were fluffy meat 
clouds with a crispy crust that released a minty oregano-scented steam when 
pierced. You may think this hyperbole; if so, just try them.&rdquo;</p> 
</blockquote> <br>
Mint? Steam? Crust? In a meatball? Yes &mdash; seriously, 
this is not like any meatball we&rsquo;d ever met.<br>
<br>
Lulu shares her 
Greek mentor&rsquo;s recipe for these highly unusual treats with precise 
instructions juxtaposed with her tongue planted firmly in her cheek. The recipe 
calls for almost equal amounts (by weight) of ground meat and a combination of 
soaked bread, onions, ouzo (or wine, we used wine) and eggs; and also includes 
parsley, oregano and mint. I have to admit that I was sorely tempted to mess 
with this recipe, especially when I saw the proportion of meat to &ldquo;other 
stuff&rdquo; and how wet the mixture was once it was combined. I don&rsquo;t 
care for doughy, mushy meatballs or meatballs that are more filler than meat 
&mdash; you know the ones: leaden and blah. I was afraid these were going to be 
like that.<br>
<br>
Lucky for us, before I came across the Keftedes recipe I 
had read Lulu&rsquo;s About page wherein she recounts her first experiences 
with Mama&rsquo;s (friend Zoe&rsquo;s mother) recipes and how she battled her 
own inclination to mess with Mama&rsquo;s recipes. She describes Mama&rsquo;s 
passion for keeping true to her recipes and that is something I respect so I, 
too, followed the recipe to a &ldquo;T&rdquo; &mdash; and boy, am I glad I did.
<br><br>
We&rsquo;ve had these at 2 different times now, and I still marvel at 
how they are both meaty AND crisp and light at the same time. There is nothing 
doughy or heavy about these keftedes. Still not sure what black magic happens 
once these simple ingredients are combined in just the manner Lulu describes, 
but hey, I&rsquo;m not gonna tinker with it.<br>
<br>
This is an incredibly 
frugal recipe, too &mdash; with just 1 pound of ground meat we got about 36-38 
medium-sized Keftedes (I kind of lost track the second time b/c we were pretty 
much eating them as they came out of the oil). Lulu provides a Keftedes 
size-graphic with the recipe so you&rsquo;ll see what I mean by 
&ldquo;medium.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Actually we&rsquo;ve only made one batch of the 
meat mixture, and froze half of it to use at a later time. Last week when we 
tried the pakodas recipe above, we thawed the remaining keftedes mixture, 
shaped &amp; floured them, and fried them after the pakodas were done. The 
keftedes made from the frozen mixture tasted as fresh, meaty and light as the 
original batch so if you&rsquo;re cooking for one or two, freezing the uncooked 
meat mixture works well. Unlike other meatball recipes where we would cook up 
the whole batch at the beginning, this recipe is at its crispy best when eaten 
hot and fresh. Find Lulu&rsquo;s post on this recipe here .<br>
<br>
So our 
thanks to Marv, Mansi and Lulu for taking us along with them on a culinary 
globe trot. It was a great ride!

<h1>Date &amp; Tamarind Cake</h1>  July13 2008 
<p><br>
</p> 
<p>I liked everyone&rsquo;s ideas for making use of the tamarind nectar and 
chopped dates I found in the pantry &mdash; all of them were much healthier 
suggestions than what I had come up with: a cake.<br>
<br>
The cake idea was 
first inspired by a recipe I&rsquo;ve been meaning to try for a cake with dates 
and chocolate from<em>Death By Chocolate</em><em>, </em>by Marcel Desaulniers. 
But when I found the tamarind nectar, too, my mind wandered to the 
tamarind-date chutney we had just sampled. Tangy tamarind and sweet dates in a 
cake? What would that taste like?<br>
<br>
Of course, when making chutney one 
would use tamarind pods or paste instead of nectar, but I only wanted to borrow 
some of the flavor components from tamarind-date chutney: cumin and coriander. 
Cayenne, or red chili powder, was the third key flavor in the chutney, but I 
thought that was going too far in a cake!<br>
<br>
The proportions and method 
for making the cake, including the chocolate and nut topping on half the cake, 
came from the book.<br>
<br>
I didn&rsquo;t get much feedback on the cake 
except through the grapevine. It seemed the consensus was that the cake with 
the chocolate and nuts was too sweet, although I cut back 1/4 cup of sugar from 
the original recipe and was using less-sweet raw sugar. The topless version of 
the cake was lightly sweet and moist, with a hint of exotic from the cumin 
&mdash; probably one of the last spices you might expect in a cake! I think it 
makes a wonderful snack cake, especially with dark coffee.<br>
<br>
If I were 
making this only for our family, I would not have put the chocolate and nuts on 
the cake because we are not big consumers of sweets. But I have to confess that 
a sliver of cake with the topping was trimmed during slicing and saved as a 
&ldquo;chef&rsquo;s perk&rdquo; for later. That evening we were enjoying 
another pantry item that needed to be consumed &mdash; port wine, and we were 
delighted to find that the combination of port with the nuts, chocolate and 
spices in the cake was a real winner!<br>
<br>
We will make this cake again, 
probably without the topping unless we&rsquo;re expecting to share it again. I 
would like to try the plain cake again with nuts mixed into the batter, too.<br>
<br>Thanks again to everyone who played along!<br>
<br>
DATE &amp; TAMARIND CAKE
<br>(inspired by a chutney and a recipe from <em>Death By Chocolate (1992)</em>
, Marcel Desaulniers)<br>
<br>
1 1/2 cups tamarind nectar<br>
2 cups (225g) 
chopped dates<br>
1 cup (225g) unsalted butter<br>
2 cups (200g) whole wheat 
flour<br>
1/2 tsp. salt<br>
1 tsp. baking soda<br>
1 tsp. cinnamon<br>
1/2 tsp. 
cumin powder<br>
2 tsp. coriander powder <br>
1-1/4 cup (220g) raw sugar, 
(240g) regular sugar<br>
2 large eggs<br>
1 tsp. vanilla extract<br>
<br>

Optional Topping: (See 2d set of baking instructions)<br>
3 cups dark chocolate 
chips or chunks<br>
1 cup chopped macadamia or walnuts<br>
<br>
Grease and 
flour 9x13 inch pan. (I don&rsquo;t have a 9x13 pan so I used a 9&rdquo; square 
cake pan and a 6-muffin tin.)<br>
<br>
Heat tamarind nectar to just boiling. 
Pour over dates. Let cool completely and set aside until needed.<br>
<br>

Combine flour, baking soda, salt and spices. Sift to combine.<br>
<br>
Cream 
together butter and sugar until light.<br>
<br>
Add eggs, one at a time and 
beat on high until completely combined each time (about 15 seconds). Scrape 
down bowl. Beat on high for 20 seconds.<br>
<br>
Add vanilla, and beat again 
for 15 seconds. Scrape down, then add flour mixture. Stir to combine, then beat 
on low for 15 seconds.<br>
<br>
Add cooled date-tamarind mixture, and beat on 
medium speed for 20 seconds to combine. With rubber spatula, finish combining, 
then pour into prepared pan.<br>
</p> <br>
<br>
Bake in middle rack of 
pre-heated oven for 10 40-45 minutes, or until toothpick inserted in center 
comes out clean.<br>
<br>
Let cool on rack 30-40 minutes before turning out to 
cool completely.<br>
<br>
If using optional topping: Bake in middle rack of 
pre-heated oven for 20 minutes, then sprinkle chocolate and nuts over cake and 
return to oven for another 20-25 minutes, or until toothpick inserted in center 
comes out clean.<br>
<br>
Let cool on rack 30-40 minutes, then place in fridge 
for at least 20 minutes to firm up (but not harden) chocolate before slicing.
<br> <br>
If cake chills completely in fridge (so that chocolate hardens), 
leave out for 30 minutes before attempting to slice the cake, or the dark 
chocolate will be almost impossible to cut through, even with a serrated knife. 
I managed to mangle the first piece when I tried to saw through the chocolate 
topping when the cake was still cold. It may not be so difficult to cut the 
cake when it&rsquo;s cold if you opt for milk chocolate or semi-sweet chips 
instead.<br>

<h1>Piccata-style Pork Cutlets</h1>  July10 2008 
<p><br>
</p> 
<p>Capers, capers, and more capers! This is probably at least twice, but more 
likely three times, more capers than sane people use when making piccata, 
especially with the classic veal or chicken which are both very mild meats. But 
since we just bought a Costco-sized bottle of capers in brine, why not indulge 
in caper happiness? ...Who are we kidding? We buy capers in Costco-sized jars 
BECAUSE we&rsquo;re caper-happy.<br>
<br>
These Piccata-style Pork Cutlets were 
our second-course following that onoPasta with Cantaloupe Sauce we had earlier. 
Because the pasta was both creamy and slightly sweet, we knew we couldn&rsquo;t 
have that as a sole entree, so we opted to eat in courses. The pasta was our 
first course, and this dish followed with some bruschetta with garlic. We will 
probably want that cantaloupe sauce again while melons are in high season here, 
and next time we may follow it with a piccata-style fish.<br>
</p> <br>
<br>

Before we moved to Germany, I always used chicken breasts to make piccata, but 
while we lived there I tried using pork cutlets because it was a very popular 
cut in the markets and Metzgerei. Likewise in the shops around Hawaii you can 
find thinly sliced pork loin cutlets, cut for Japanese <em>tonkatsu</em>  
(panko-crusted, deep-fried pork cutlets). This saves the step of having to 
butterfly chicken breasts before pounding to the desired thin-ness. Now we can 
go straight to the pounding! Rolling pins ready?? Let&rsquo;s go!<br>
<br>
I 
have to say that this causes quite a racket. Our poor cat Kiowea went scurrying 
to hide when I started with the whacking. He doesn&rsquo;t like loud noises 
anyway, but this really through him for a loop. Poor dear!<br>
<br>
<br>
These 
two cutlets at top show the 1/4-inch tonkatsu cut &mdash; already beautifully 
cut and so-o-o lean. In the bottom half of the photo, one cutlet has been 
pounded to the desired paper-thin slip for piccata, or for Vietnamese-style BBQ 
pork , or very small Schnitzel. LOL<br>
<br>
Lay a good measure of wax paper on 
a large cutting board, then place your cutlets about 6-7 inches apart from each 
other. Be generous &mdash; they will need some space to spread when you start 
pounding. I&rsquo;ve found it helpful when pounding meat to start with a good 
whack in the center of the piece, then to continue pounding while moving to one 
edge, then back from the center to the other edge. Think of it like the action 
of rolling out a pie crust &mdash; from the center, to the edge.<br>
<br>

Whether chicken, pork or fish, we prefer piccata-style dishes without the 
breading on the meat. It saves on calories and prep time, as well as just 
letting the flavors of the meat and piquant gravy shine.<br>
<br>
Another plus 
for this preparation is that it cooks so quickly that even with the time you 
will spend pounding the cutlets, dinner can be on the table in 30-40 minutes. 
And it is so flavorful &mdash; chock full of garlic, butter, wine, lemon, and 
yes, capers &mdash; that even simple undressed pasta will shine beside it! Put 
the water for the pasta on to boil before you start pounding meat, and the 
whole thing will finish about the same time. You can even remove the finished 
meat and sauce from the pan, and add the drained cooked pasta to the same pan 
to gather up the last bits of flavor in the pan. It&rsquo;s not pretty, true, 
but you&rsquo;ll have yourself a great meal nonetheless!<br>
<br>
PICCATA-STYLE 
PORK FILLETS<br>
for 2 persons<br>
<br>
3 cloves garlic, sliced thinly<br>
2 
TBL. olive oil<br>
1/3 lb. pork loin cutlets for tonkatsu or Schnitzel, about 6 
pieces for tonkatsu, 2 Schnitzel<br>
 (pounded to desired thin-ness, see above)
<br>sea salt<br>
ground black pepper<br>
1/4 cup very dry white wine (Pinot 
Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc or even dry Vermouth)<br>
2 TBL. capers, rinsed if 
desired (the photos on this page show more like 6 TBL. capers)<br>
1-1/2 TBL. 
unsalted butter<br>
Juice of half a lemon<br>
<br>
Over medium high heat, 
lightly brown garlic in oil, then remove from pan and save.<br>
<br>
Lightly 
season pounded cutlets with sea salt and ground black pepper, then place in 
single layer in pan to lightly brown each side (do in batches). This will take 
about 90 seconds or so per side. Remove to warmed platter while doing second 
batch.<br>
<br>
<br>
When all cutlets are browned, de-glaze pan with wine, 
scraping up all the browned bits at the bottom, and allow to cook until reduced 
by half (about a full minute). Add capers and butter, and swirl through pan. 
When the liquid starts bubbling (about 1 minute), return meat and browned 
garlic to pan and cook for another minute, or until meat is heated through. 
Turn off heat and squeeze lemon over. Taste to correct for salt.<br>
<br>
Serve 
with your favorite pasta, or even simple cooked noodles with the pan gravy on 
top. A salad and the same dry white wine you poured for the recipe will round 
out your meal. Pictured: Piccata pork with simple linguine noodles and 
courgettes.<br>

<h1>Island Fresh: Melons</h1>  July07 2008 
<p><br>
(click on logo to learn more about the Buy Local campaign on the CTAHR 
site)<br>
</p> <br>
<br>

<p></p> 
<p>One of the things we&rsquo;ve always been passionate about is eating local 
produce as much as possible. Yes, we&rsquo;re tempted away sometimes by 
beautiful Brussel sprouts or white asparagus that have travelled from farther 
than the Neighbor Islands, and some staples like our beloved rice and even 
russet potatoes are just not grown around here.<br>
<br>
But living in Hawaii 
you almost have to work NOT to eat local produce daily. A wide array of 
gorgeous locally grown produce is available seasonally all year round &mdash; 
from asparagus to zucchini, and just about everything in between.<br>
<br>
The 
&ldquo;Island Fresh: Buy Fresh, Buy Local&rdquo; campaign is in its third year 
now. Sponsored jointly by the Hawaii Farm Bureau, the state&rsquo;s Department 
of Agriculture, and the UH-College of Tropical Agriculture and Human Resources 
(CTAHR), the promotion of &ldquo;Island Fresh&rdquo; has enjoyed new vigor in 
the last few months, especially with the wave of food scares this year in the 
U.S. Most recently, it&rsquo;s E. coli bacteria causing food poisonings; the 
primary suspect, tomatoes. Hawaii is one of the few states that has not 
reported cases in this latest scare.<br>
<br>
Download a poster from CTAHR 
showingfruit and vegetable seasonal availability in Hawaii throughout the year, 
and never miss a season!<br>
<br>
Summer time is melon time, and there are few 
things more refreshing than a chilled slice of melon in the midst of summer 
heat. We&rsquo;re fortunate to have one of the best producers of sweet, 
true-tasting melons just down the road between Ewa and Kapolei. Aloun Farms 
grows these honeydew, cantaloupe and miniature Thai watermelons, as well as a 
wealth of other produce, including the Ewa sweet onions we used in theFour 
Allii Tart earlier. We&rsquo;ve found melons from Aloun at almost all the 
supermarkets, as well as farmers&rsquo; markets, festivals, and the fresh 
produce stand outside the Farm on Farrington Highway on the way to Kapolei. We 
especially love the tiny Thai watermelons, which are slightly larger than a 
cantaloupe, with few seeds, and a deep watermelon flavor. It&rsquo;s also the 
perfect size for our two-person household.<br>
</p> <br>
<br>
We look for 
melons that are heavy for their size, and for honeydew and cantaloupe that are 
fragrant at the stem end. If you aren&rsquo;t going to serve them right away, 
we&rsquo;ve found it helpful in Hawaii to wrap the fruit in newspaper to keep 
the inevitable bugs away. When ready to use, wash the melons well before 
slicing in a solution of 2 tablespoons of vinegar for every 1 quart/liter of 
cool water. Although you may not eat the melon rind, it&rsquo;s important to 
wash the outside because bacteria and other cooties on the outside rind can be 
transported into the flesh by your own knife action while slicing the melon.<br>
<br> And if you need any more incentive to eat melons, especially watermelon 
&mdash; did you catch the news making headlines last week that watermelon 
&ldquo; is richer than experts believed in an amino acid called citrulline, 
which relaxes and dilates blood vessels much like Viagra &rdquo; (see full 
article on <em>WebMD</em> ). Although scientists are still not entirely sure 
just how much watermelon a person would have to consume to experience 
Viagra-like effects, they agree that it is still a nutrient-rich, low-calorie 
snack full of potassium, lycopene and carotene. Traditional Chinese Medicine 
(TCM) views these 3 melons as cool and sweet in nature, meaning they clear heat 
from the body and have properties that tonify the kidneys with their high water 
content.<br>
<br>
There are few better ways to eat melons than simply peeled 
and cooled, although many cultures in tropical climates also dip or sprinkle 
salt and hot sauce on fruits, including melons, pineapples, mangoes, and 
papayas. Growing up, I often opted for the salt and hot sauce, but more often 
now it&rsquo;s just the pure fruit.<br>
<br>
<br>
However, a couple of weeks 
ago we did try this novel Pasta with Cantaloupe Sauce  we saw on Rowena&rsquo;s 
site. A sweet pasta sauce? &mdash; sounds pretty wild, doesn&rsquo;t it? You 
can&rsquo;t believe how incredible the combination is until you taste it for 
yourself &mdash; sweet cantaloupe with savory ingredients like parmesan, grape 
tomatoes (from Oahu&rsquo;s North Shore in Kahuku), cream and butter!<br>
<br>

Rowena&rsquo;s version highlights the musky flavors of the Tuscan melons she 
finds in the Italian Alps, but we can testify that Ewa cantaloupes shine in 
this unique treatment as well. In fact, it&rsquo;s on the menu again this week! 
The key to this recipe is the freshness and natural sweetness of the melon, so 
use whatever is local in your region. In fact, when I went shopping with this 
cantaloupe sauce in mind, the market was carrying muskmelons similar to the 
Tuscan melons, but these were not local. The far-travelled muskmelons had no 
fragrance at all, and experience hard-learned (and at great expense) taught 
that this would probably taste bland and watery despite their price tag more 
than double the local melons.<br>
<br>
<br>
The cantaloupe sauce comes out this 
gorgeous deep orange hue, with the most gratifying juxtaposition of mint and 
umami-rich fresh-grated parmesan. We halved the original recipe to serve this 
as a first course (rather than a whole meal), followed by a piquant 
piccata-style pork. It was the perfect point and counter-point, especially with 
a crisp California pinot gris. We recommend this to everyone during this summer 
melon season.<br>
<br>
Get the recipe at Rubber Slippers in Italy  then go get 
you a melon!<br>

<h1>Double Mango Wholewheat Quickbread</h1>  July01 2008 July 7, 2008: 
It&rsquo;s been a hectic last couple of weeks. Sorry, I thought this actually 
got posted last week... <br>
<br>

<p><br>
</p> 
<p>Mango season is in full swing in the Islands! We were gifted recently with 
a bag of home-picked beauties, and after having our fill of mango<em>au naturel
</em>, the rest were peeled and put to good use. First up was a whole wheat 
mango bread using both fresh and dried mangoes. The fresh Hayden mangoes 
provide yummy mango deliciousness and moisture, while the dried mangoes add 
extra mango tanginess and texture.<br>
<br>
DOUBLE MANGO WHOLE WHEAT QUICKBREAD
<br>Enough for 2 loaves: 8-1/2 in. x 4-1/2 in. each (or 18 muffins or 1 bundt 
cake)<br>
<br>
2-1/2 cups (325g) whole wheat flour <br>
2 tsp bkg soda<br>
1 
tsp salt<br>
1 cup (230g) unsalted butter, room temp.<br>
2 cups (350g) raw 
brown sugar<br>
4 large mangoes, peeled and chopped (about half-pound or 225g)
<br>4 large eggs<br>
1 package (100g) dried mango, chopped <br>
1 cup chopped 
nuts (115g) (optional)<br>
<br>
<br>
Preheat oven 350F/180C. Grease and flour 
loaf pans.<br>
<br>
Combine flour, baking soda, and salt. Set aside. <br>
<br>

In large bowl, beat butter and sugar together until well combined. Beat in 
mango pulp, then eggs until completely mixed. Mixture may look curdled &mdash; 
don&rsquo;t worry, that&rsquo;s normal.<br>
<br>
Stir in dried mango and nuts 
(if using). Lastly, add dry ingredients and stir just until blended &mdash; 
don&rsquo;t overmix.<br>
<br>
Immediately spread in prepared pans and bake 
55-60 minutes, or until thin wooden skewer comes clean.<br>
(For muffins, bake 
22-25 minutes; Bundt pan, 60-70 minutes).<br>
<br>
Cool in pan 10 minutes, then 
turn out to wire rack to cool completely.<br>

<h1>Rafute: Melts in your mouth, not on your hashi</h1>  June25 2008 <br>
<br>

There are few things that bring home Okinawan cooking to me more than <em>Rafute
</em> , a meltingly tender and succulent braised pork belly that my dad calls 
&ldquo;Okinawan bacon&rdquo; (he&rsquo;s Filipino, mom&rsquo;s from Okinawa). 
He calls it that because 40-odd years ago his mother-in-law &mdash; unsure what 
to feed the new &ldquo;foreign&rdquo; son-in-law living in her tiny house in 
Shuri &mdash; used to make it for him for breakfast. With eggs and rice, of 
course.<br>
<br>
Now, the uninitiated may look at pork belly and think, 
&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t eat that, it&rsquo;s nothing but fat!&rdquo; Aahh, but 
looks can be deceiving. In the case of rafute, the pork belly is first simmered 
for a long while in a seasoned bath of ginger, awamori or other alcohol, and 
water. The bath serves a dual purpose. First, to par-cook and remove the strong 
flavors of raw pork, thanks to the ginger and alcohol. Second, to remove a lot 
of the fat, which melts into the liquid and out of the pork. The pork can then 
be sliced and simmered again in a savory braising liquid that infuses flavor 
into the meat, and in the end glazes it and brings it to quivering tenderness. 
You think I exaggerate, but that&rsquo;s only because you haven&rsquo;t tried 
this yet.<br>
<br>
Once fullly cooked and seasoned, rafute is a handy thing to 
have in the fridge to top those wonderful Okinawan soba noodles (photo bottom) 
you can find in Hawaii (or Okinawa, lucky you!), for yakisoba, as a side dish 
with tofu champuru &mdash; or yes, you can eat them for breakfast! (Uwajimaya 
in WA/OR carries Hawaii-made Okinawan style soba the last time we were in that 
area.) I also use rafute when making Abura Miso , but that&rsquo;s a story for 
another day...<br>
<br>
Rafute freezes well, too, if you can vacuum seal it 
somehow. Then you can whip up an Okinawan-style soba/ramen any time! After the 
pork belly is removed from the first simmering broth, chilling the broth will 
make it easier to discard the layer of lard that forms on the surface. (If you 
are more enterprising than I, you can put this pure pork lard aside for other 
cooking purposes, too.)<br>
<br>
<br>
From &ldquo;Okinawan Cookery and 
Culture&rdquo; (1984), a wondertful spiral-bound collection of recipes and 
cultural anecdotes from members of Hawaii&rsquo;s large Okinawan community, 
there are notes to several recipes that it&rsquo;s the large proportion of 
alcohol that gives rafute its distinctive melting quality. I never had <em>
awamori,</em> an Okinawan distilled spirit made from Thai-style long grain rice 
<em>,</em>  to play with until we came to Oahu. Growing up, my mother used 
sake. Until now, I used whiskey or bourbon. But Don Quijote on Oahu carries 
small bottles of awamori that are cheap enough ($5 for 375ml) that we can cook 
with it quite liberally for now.<br>
<br>
BTW, <em>hashi</em>  are chopsticks.
<br><br>
RAFUTE<br>
To Par-boil:<br>
3 lb. not too lean pork belly<br>
2-inch 
length of ginger, peeled and sliced<br>
1/2 cup (120ml) awamori or whiskey or 
sake<br>
<br>
Gently bruise sliced ginger with the heel of your knife. Place 
pork belly and ginger in a heavy-bottomed pan. Add awamori or other alcohol, 
then cover meat with water by at least 1 inch. Over medium heat, bring just to 
a boil, then cover and immediately reduce heat to a simmer. (Don&rsquo;t let 
the pot stay at a hard boil or the pork will &ldquo;seize&rdquo; and toughen 
the lean parts of the meat.) Simmer for 1 hour, checking occasionally to make 
sure water hasn&rsquo;t boiled and left meat dry, and topping off with hot 
water to keep meat covered.<br>

<p><br>
<br>
</p> 
<p>Remove pork from liquid. Chill broth and remove layer of lard on surface. 
When just cool enough to handle, slice pork 2-1/2 inches across and about 1/2 
inch thick.<br>
</p> 
<p><br>
<br>
</p> 
<p>Initial Braising Liquid:<br>
1 cup (240ml) broth from Par-cooking stage, or 
plain water<br>
1 cup (240ml) awamori or sake<br>
3/4 cup (160g) raw sugar<br>

1 slice of ginger (optional)<br>
<br>
Combine all ingredients in a 
heavy-bottomed pan and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat to medium, 
and add sliced pork. When heat returns to bubbling, reduce to barely a simmer, 
cover and cook for about 25 minutes.<br>
</p> 
<p><br>
<br>
</p> 
<p>Turn slices over, cover again and simmer another 20 minutes.<br>
</p> 
<p><br>
<br>
</p> 
<p>Add 1/4 cup shoyu and stir through to combine evenly with rest of braising 
liquid. Cook 15 minutes at the lowest simmer with no cover to allow the liquid 
to start evaporating. Turn slices over and continue cooking without a cover for 
another 15 minutes or so. Check texture, you should be able to cut through the 
meat, &ldquo;fat,&rdquo; and skin with a spoon. It should be akin to room 
temperature butter. If everything except the meat part is soft, it probably 
means the meat remained at a boil too long in the par-cooking stage and 
toughened &mdash; just continue on to the next step. If even the 
&ldquo;fat&rdquo; and skin give resistance, add 1/4 cup mirin-water mix, cover 
again and let simmer for 15-20 minutes, then check again.<br>
</p> 
<p><br>
<br>
</p> 
<p>Now the braising liquid is turning into a sticky glaze. Continue cooking 
without a cover for another 20-30 minutes, turning meat over every 5-7 minutes, 
depending on how quickly the glaze is forming. Before the glaze dries off 
completely, turn heat off, cover pan and let meat cool in glaze. Will keep in 
fridge for at least a week, months in the freezer if you can protect it from 
freezer burn.<br>
</p> 
<p><br>
</p> 
<p>To re-heat rafute, heat in an oiled skillet over medium heat until hot. 
Microwave re-heating can be tricky, and cause &ldquo;burned&rdquo; spots where 
the skin or areas near the skin turn into chicharrone (aka crackling) &mdash; a 
lesson learned the hard way. After spending such a long time to make these 
beauties, I prefer the pan for re-heating.<br>
<br>
Our favorite way to use 
rafute &mdash; with Okinawan soba noodles and broth, and garnished with ginger, 
pre-cookedwatercress, gai choy or choi sum, and way too many braised shiitake.

<h1>Kasu-Marinated Butterfish</h1>  June20 2008 <br>
<br>
No arm-twisting was 
required to convince us to try this different take on the Miso Butterfish  we 
love so much &mdash; Butterfish marinated with <em>Kasu</em> , or sake lees. 
Happily, butterfish (a.k.a. sablefish or black cod) is a &ldquo;Best&rdquo; 
(from Alaska) or &ldquo;Good&rdquo; (from U.S. West Coast) choice on the 
Seafood Watch  list. (Read more about choosing safe fish and shellfish  for 
Hawaii, the US, and around the world.)<br>
<br>
I&rsquo;ve had kasu on my list 
of things to try for well over a year now, but with no luck finding it in the 
shops. A month or so ago, I spotted a new package on the top shelf of the 
Japanese refrigerated goods section at DQ (not the ice cream place, the former 
Daiei). I recognized the brand symbol on the cover as a sake brand, so that 
bode well. Sure enough, it contained sheets of sake lees. Yes, sheets &mdash; 
flat, compressed and heavenly-scented sheets. Not what I was expecting either 
&mdash; I had been looking for a paste-like product resembling packaged miso.
<br> <br>
<br>
As soon as I could get my hands on a few butterfish fillets, 
we&rsquo;d be set. The store I was in does not usually carry fresh butterfish 
so I made a mental note to look in Chinatown on our next visit. But when I 
wandered over to the fresh fish displays, there they were &mdash; butterfish 
steaks! And they were on sale that week. It was definitely a sign. Fillets 
would have been nice, but butterfish does not have many small pins or bones, so 
I left the steaks whole.<br>
<br>
What exactly are sake lees? 
&ldquo;Lees&rdquo; is a nice word for the silty precipitate of dead yeast 
&mdash; and, in the case of sake, rice &mdash; that settles out from wine in 
the production process. It sounds much more palatable than &ldquo;dregs,&rdquo; 
doesn&rsquo;t it? Sake lees, or kasu, have an incredibly intoxicating aroma. It 
is easy to see why sake vintners would be loath to simply discard the fragrant 
paste. Besides its use as a culinary ingredient, kasu can be further 
commercially processed to make a distilled liquor and a vinegar.<br>
<br>
We 
have now tried both the marinated fish and a heady soup in which kasu was the 
star ingredient. Both were delicious and thoroughly addictive. (We&rsquo;ll 
share more about the soup during soup season.) You can also try your hand at 
making pickled vegetables with kasu at home, but the most intriguing home use 
for kasu I found is as a moisturizing face masque ! It is supposed to leave 
your skin baby-soft. And delicious smelling, too, no doubt! Kasu keeps for a 
long time, so buy it when you see it and tuck it away in the fridge until you 
need it.<br>
<br>
This particular recipe requires long planning &mdash; 10 days 
of marination. There are a slew of recipes with much shorter marinating times, 
but most of them also include miso paste, sake or mirin, shoyu and other 
ingredients. I wanted to let the pure kasu flavor through so I devised this one 
after much reading. If you&rsquo;d like a more subtle kasu flavor, I&rsquo;ve 
had this recipe  from the <em>Honolulu Star-Bulletin</em>  bookmarked for 
months to try in future.<br>
<br>
You can cook this after 4 days, but patience 
will be rewarded (here&rsquo;s looking at you, Italy).<br>
<br>
KASU-MARINATED 
BUTTERFISH<br>
(inspired by an artice on esake.com )<br>
1 TBL. sea salt<br>

1/2 cup kasu paste, about 2 sheets<br>
3 TBL. raw sugar<br>
1/3 cup water<br>
2 
butterfish steaks or fillets with skin on, about 6-8oz. each<br>
<br>
Combine 
kasu, salt, sugar and water, and stir to make a thick paste. Place half of 
paste in the bottom of a glass or other non-reactive pan.<br>
<br>
Wash and pat 
dry the butterfish, and place on the kasu mixture. Cover fish with remaining 
kasu mixture. Cover tightly and put away in a corner of the fridge for 10 days.
<br> <br>
When ready to cook, remove fish from refrigerator and bring to room 
temperature. Remove fish from kasu, and with a paper towel, gently wipe away 
most of the paste.<br>
<br>
Pre-heat skillet over medium heat. Add 2 TBL. oil 
to pan. Season fish with salt (I used alaea salt, that&rsquo;s the pink grains 
you can see past the water drop on my lens), then add to skillet, salted side 
down. Season the second side of the fish. Cook, uncovered, for 4-5 minutes 
&mdash; fillets will cook quicker than steaks. Turn over and cook another 5-6 
minutes, or until fish is cooked through (will flake with a fork).<br>

<p><br>
Serve with rice, pickled ginger, and flash-cooked greens dressed with 
sesameor ponzu dressing.<br>

<h1>Piri-piri Chicken</h1>  June18 2008 <br>
<br>
Have you tried Piri-piri 
Chicken? If not, you&rsquo;re in for a treat. There is a chicken franchise in 
the U.S. called El Pollo Loco that prepares chicken in a similar way &mdash; 
marinaded in citrus and spices for a few days, then grilled low and slow, and 
basted with more flavor. I was a big fan. Then we moved overseas, and I tried 
to duplicate the flavors of EPL chicken at home, but with no luck.<br>
<br>
One 
day I happened upon a Nando&rsquo;s chicken restaurant in London (at 
Earl&rsquo;s Court) and fell in love all over again. Nando&rsquo;s is a South 
African restaurant franchise that serves a <em>Portuguese-style piri-piri 
chicken BBQ</em> (I know, it&rsquo;s confusing &mdash; it has to do with 
historical migration patterns but never mind that now) <em>.</em>  Piri-piri ( 
Nando&rsquo;s spells it differently ) is a zestier, tastier and more succulent 
BBQ chicken than even EPL, so the urgency to grill chicken at home was 
temporarily quashed &mdash; I could just nip over to Nando&rsquo;s for a 
grilled chicken fix! When we later moved to Boston, we were treated to even 
better home-style piri-piri chicken in some of the small Portuguese-run 
eateries around Cambridge, the best was at a tiny 6-table cafe in Inman Square.
<br> <br>
<br>
Since that long ago time we&rsquo;ve found a primo marinade 
recipe to make at home because we&rsquo;ve lived the last 6 years out of reach 
of ready-made piri-piri chicken. The name piri-piri comes from the sauce made 
with small red chile peppers, called <em>malagueta</em> , that are the key 
flavor ingredient in the marinade. Finding the right pepper sauce, also called 
<em>molho de malagueta</em> , is the first and hardest part of making this 
recipe. Look for it in Brazilian or Portuguese markets in your area &mdash; it 
is a thick, deep red sauce usually sold in a tapered bottle. There is also a 
clear vinegar sauce with whole peppers floating in the bottle that is also 
labelled <em>molha de malagueta</em>  or piri-piri sauce, but that&rsquo;s not 
what we use.<br>
<br>
Also, the mala gueta chile pepper used in this sauce is 
not  the same as the mele gueta pepper, also known as &ldquo;grains of 
paradise.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
The original recipe from which this is adapted says 
you can substitute Tabasco (brand) sauce for the real thing, but the chicken 
will taste very different when made with Tabasco (and by different, I mean 
&ldquo;wrong&rdquo;). The Portuguese sauce is much thicker than Tabasco, and 
has a wholly different flavor. If you don&rsquo;t care for very 
&ldquo;hot&rdquo; foods, don&rsquo;t worry. The cooked chicken does not enflame 
your mouth with pepper-heat &mdash; the piri-piri sauce is primarily a 
flavoring agent. You can, of course, increase the heat by adding larger amounts 
of piri-piri sauce to the marinade.<br>
<br>
This recipe is more like the 
home-spun piri-piri chickens we enjoyed around Cambridge than the commercial 
versions. Plan to prepare the marinade at least 24 hours before you intend to 
start grilling. If you can give it a 2-day headstart, you will be richly 
rewarded.<br>
<br>
Warning: once you do try this chicken, you may become as 
obsessed with its addictive flavor as we have!<br>
<br>
PIRI-PIRI CHICKEN<br>

Adapted from <em>The Barbecue! Bible (1998)</em>  by Steven Raichlen<br>
<br>

For the Marinade:<br>
1/4 cup olive oil<br>
4 TBL. unsalted butter<br>
1 whole 
lemon, juiced and rind cut into 10 pieces<br>
1 TBL. red wine vinegar<br>
2-3 
TBL. Piri-piri sauce (use minimum 2 TBL. to get the piri-piri flavor)<br>
2 
tsp. sweet paprika<br>
3/4 tsp. ground coriander seed<br>
3 cloves garlic, 
peeled and chopped<br>
2 scallions, washed and thinly sliced<br>
3 sprigs 
flat-leaf parsley, washed and leaves separated from stems<br>
1&rdquo; piece of 
ginger, peeled and slivered<br>
2 bay leaves<br>
1/2 tsp. sea salt<br>
1/2 tsp. 
ground black pepper<br>
<br>
Place all marinade ingredients  except lemon rinds 
 into a blender or food processor. Puree until smooth. Taste and correct for 
salt, especially if using larger quantity of piri-piri sauce. Put half of 
marinade and the lemon rinds into a non-reactive bowl, or a large plastic 
zipper bag.<br>
<br>
1 whole chicken (3.5-4lbs/1.5-1.8kg), cleaned, backbone 
removed, and cut into quarters<br>
<br>
Cut partially through the leg joints 
where the the drum and thigh meet. Carefully slide a finger under the skin and 
loosen skin from flesh. Add leg portions to marinade, and insinuate some 
marinade between skin and flesh.<br>
<br>
Cut partially through the joint 
between wing and breast. Carefully separate skin and flesh around the breast, 
and make a pocket between the tenderloin and the top of breast. Add to 
marinade, and also incorporate marinade under skin and next to tenderloin. Add 
remaining marinade, cover and let marinate in fridge for at leat 24 hours. 48 
is better. The best we&rsquo;ve made at home was marinated for 60.<br>
<br>

Prepare your BBQ or grill for cooking with indirect heat. ( Learn how from the 
master himself at Steve Raichlen&rsquo;s site ) <br>
<br>
Oil your grate well. 
Add chicken pieces to the grill, skin-side up. Baste with remaining marinade, 
cover grill and cook for 30 minutes. Uncover and baste again with marinade. 
Discard any remaining marinade. (Do not use marinade to baste in the last 10 
minutes of grilling.) Cover grill and cook another 20-40 minutes, or until the 
juices run clear in the thickest part of the thigh and breast (instant-read 
thrermometer will show 180F). Leg joints may cook faster than breast quarters, 
so start checking them first.<br>
<br>
If you want to crisp up the skin, cook 
over direct heat for the last 5-8 minutes of grilling time.<br>

<p><br>
</p> 
<p>Cut into serving pieces. In every restaurant we&rsquo;ve ever had piri-piri 
chicken, it is served with fried or roasted potatoes, but at home we prefer 
rice! Offer extra piri-piri sauce and lemon wedges on the side.<br>

<h1>Baked Monchong with Hummous Crust</h1>  June16 2008 
<p><br>
</p> 
<p>When it comes to food from the deep and the reef, the waters have gotten 
very murky lately, literally and figuratively. Literally, since it seems every 
week there is a report identifying another fish species as having dangerously 
high levels of mercury, PCBs, and other toxins from fertilizer run-offs and 
other pollutants in the nation&rsquo;s oceans and rivers; and figuratively 
when, along with the warnings, health advocates encourage consumers to 
incorporate more fish &mdash; rich in omega-3 fatty acids and lean protein 
&mdash; into their diet. And as if this weren&rsquo;t confusing enough, 
environmentalists want consumers to be aware of the dangers of over-fishing and 
poor fisheries management both at home and abroad, too! It&rsquo;s enough to 
paralyze even the most want-to-be-informed consumer.<br>
<br>
Finally, 
there&rsquo;s help. A pocket-sized take-along guide for your wallet or purse 
identifying safe fish choices for both you and the environment from theMonterey 
Bay Aquarium&rsquo;s Seafood Watch website. Separate guides are available for 
eachregion in the U.S. (West Coast, Northeast, Hawaii, Southeast, Central, and 
Southwest) and they are color-coded to red-flag fish species that are currently 
found to carry unacceptably high toxin levels, and to highlight non-toxic 
species that are sustainably managed. The charts are available in English or 
Spanish for the U.S. There is also a searchable on-line database for different 
fish varieties that provides all the necessary information to assist you in 
making an informed choice about your seafood, and also offers alternatives if 
your first choice is either unhealthy or unsustainable.<br>
<br>
Seafood Watch 
(SFW) also provides links to similar charts prepared by the World Wildlife Fund 
or an environmental organization in the respective country forItaly, Germany, 
Canada, the UK, Indonesia, Hong Kong, Australia, France, South Africa, and New 
Zealand. From similar sites, here are also links to fish guides for Finland, 
the Netherlands, Poland, Norway, and Switzerland (available in 3 languages). 
(The guides forSpain seem to have been removed from that country&rsquo;s WWF 
website.) Most of these sites have a printable color guide that you can carry 
in your purse or wallet that make it easy to find non-toxic, sustainable 
choices in seafood; most also have a searchable database of fish varieties; 
some however, provide only an on-line database but no take-along guide.<br>
<br>
Lastly, SFW has also teamed up with the Environmental Defense Fund in producing 
a searchable national database and take-along guide for your mobile phone! 
Check it out on theEDF&rsquo;s site here.<br>
<br>
So whether you live in the 
US or one of these llisted countries, or are planning a visit to them, take 
along a portable guide to help you make wise choices for your health and the 
health of the environment.<br>
</p> <br>
<br>
And if all this reading has made 
you hungry, here&rsquo;s an exceptionally flavorful and easy way to bake fish 
that will help keep it moist and infuse flavor. Monchong, or sickle pomfret, 
(see top photo and left) is listed as a &ldquo;Good Alternative&rdquo; in the 
SFW database, and it is a meaty, mild-tasting fish that readily compliments 
strong flavors. We all know hummous (bottom, right in photo) as a thick, savory 
dip of pureed chickpeas, sesame paste (tahini), lemon juice, olive oil and salt.
<br> <br>
<br>
Usually eaten with pita or vegetables as part of a Middle 
Eastern mezze table, here hummous pulls double-duty as a crust for the baked 
fish. You can use a commercially prepared dip, but hummous, like the preserved 
lemons , costs a mere fraction of the commercial product AND is so easy to make 
at home. Try this recipe and you&rsquo;ll never want to buy a pre-made product 
again. It&rsquo;s worth the effort to boil your chickpeas from dried beans, and 
keep them frozen with some of the cooking liquid until you need them. But 
canned low-salt chickpeas are a good pantry staple for whipping up quick 
weeknight meals like this or when you&rsquo;re asked to bring a dip to 
tomorrow&rsquo;s function at work, and you don&rsquo;t have time to soak beans 
overnight. Of course, you can substitute any of the other firm, white or oily 
flesh fish in the SFW &ldquo;Best&rdquo; or &ldquo;Good Alternative&rdquo; list 
for the monchong &mdash; the first time we tried this hummous crust on fish 9 
years ago, it was with salmon and that was especially ono.<br>
<br>
<br>
BAKED 
MONCHONG WITH HUMMOUS CRUST<br>
<br>
For the Hummous:<br>
1 cup of dried 
chickpeas, soaked in water to cover at least 8 hours<br>
<br>
Drain chickpeas, 
place in 4-quart or larger saucepan, and cover with by the least 2&rdquo; of 
clean water. Bring to a boil, then lower heat to a simmer and cook for 1 hour. 
Add 1/2 tsp. of sea salt, and cook for another 30 minutes or until beans are 
easily pierced with a toothpick but not mushy (cooking time will depend on the 
hardness of your water). Turn off heat, cover and let cool in pan.<br>
<br>
2 
TBL. liquid reserved from cooking chickpeas (if using canned chickpeas, use 
plain water, not the liquid in the cans)<br>
1/2 tsp. sea salt<br>
2-4 cloves 
garlic, minced<br>
5 TBL lemon juice<br>
4 TBL olive oil<br>
1/3 cup tahini, 
a.k.a. sesame butter/paste, stirred well before measuring<br>
<br>
Place 
ingredients in the order listed above into food processor or blender. Last, add 
drained cooked chickpeas or 2 15 oz. canned low-salt chickpeas. If you prefer 
your hummous with a little texture, reserve a 1/4 cup of chickpeas. Puree the 
mix until smooth. If using a blender and the mixture is too thick, taste a 
little and see if it needs more lemon juice or water, and add accordingly. If 
you&rsquo;ve reserved some chickpeas, add them in and pulse briefly to break 
them up a bit. Taste again and correct for salt, lemon juice or olive oil. Set 
aside for at least an hour if using as a dip.<br>
<br>
For the Fish:<br>
2 6 
oz. filets of monchong, cleaned and patted dry<br>
sea salt<br>
ground black 
pepper<br>
<br>
<br>
To coat fish, season fish fillet with sea salt and ground 
black pepper. Layer a generous amount of hummous to one side of the fish. 
Measure the thickness of the fillets at the thickest point. Set aside for at 
least 30 minutes while oven and pan pre-heat.<br>
<br>
Pre-heat oven and 
oven-proof skillet or baking dish to 450F/230C.<br>
<br>
Add 2 TBL. olive oil 
to heated skillet or baking dish, and place fillets, hummous-side up, on the 
skillet or dish. Place in pre-heated oven and bake for 10 minutes for every 
1&rdquo; of fish. If top crust has not sufficiently browned by the time fish is 
cooked, set oven to broil for a minute to brown the hummous crust. Garnish with 
a pinch of paprika or chili (red pepper) powder, if desired. Serve with your 
choice of starch and vegetable.<br>

<h1>Al Fresco: Linguine with Clams</h1>  June12 2008 <br>
Fresh ingredients, 
lightly cooked, eaten ooutdoors. Pour the Soave, let&rsquo;s eat.<br>
<br>
<br>

LINGUINE WITH CLAMS<br>
(Adapted from <em>Marcella&rsquo;s Italian Kitchen</em> 
 by Marcella Hazan)<br>
for 2 people<br>
<br>
Warm 2 plates in the toaster oven 
set to 200F/95C.<br>
<br>
12 live Manila clams<br>
Scrub clam shells with 
brush. Discard any clams that do not close during cleaning.<br>
<br>
9 oz. 
(255g) dried linguine (12 oz./340g, fresh)<br>
Bring water for pasta to boil, 
while you start the sauce.<br>
<br>
3 TBL. extra virgin olive oil<br>
3 cloves 
garlic, minced<br>
4 oz (100g) sugar snap peas<br>
sea salt<br>
ground black 
pepper<br>
1/2 cup dry white wine<br>
few sprigs flat-leaf parsley, minced<br>

<br>Put garlic and oil in large skillet or wok &mdash; something that will be 
large enough to hold both the sauce and pasta. Heat pan over medium flame, and 
saute garlic until it softens and becomes aromatic. Add peas, salt and pepper, 
stir to coat with oil, and cook for 2-3 minutes, or until peas become bright 
green. Increase heat to high, and quickly add cleaned clams and wine, and 
immediately cover the pan. Cook for 4-5 minutes with cover closed, shaking pan 
occasionally.<br>
<br>
Add a good handful of coarse salt to boiling water for 
pasta, and add linguine. Return to boil and cook until barely firm to the bite, 
maybe 5 minutes for dried, and 2 for fresh. I try to slightly undercook it at 
this stage, because the pasta will still cook with the sauce.<br>
<br>
Check 
sauce. Turn heat down to medium, and remove peas and any clams that are opened 
to a warmed plate, and keep covered (this will keep them from over-cooking). 
Continue to remove clams as they open. When all clams are opened (or after 
another 4-5 minutes, discard any clams that don&rsquo;t open), add parsley to 
sauce. Drain pasta but do not rinse. Add pasta to pan, and stir well to combine 
with sauce. Return peas and clams to pan, cover, turn off heat and let pan sit 
for 3-4 minutes while wine is poured and outside table is set.<br>
<br>
Divide 
pasta and clams between two warmed bowls, garnish with more parsley, a grind of 
pepper and a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil. Carry bowls outside. Mangia!<br>
<p><br>
</p> 
<p>We actually had this meal 2 weekends ago, and afterwards I was craving a 
cake, which I rarely do. In fact, the cake I was craving was a polenta torta so 
the next day I made the version with preserved lemon and almondhere. Unlike 
many lemon desserts, the preserved lemon cake is well-suited to a rich cup of 
coffee!<br>

<h1>Acupuncture, Part III: Brewing Teas at Home </h1>  June11 2008 
<p><br>
</p> 
<p>For the last in the series about the experience of receiving acupuncture in 
the traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) setting, a brief look at how treatment 
carries over from the acupuncture clinic to your kitchen and home. You can 
choose to supplement acupuncture treatments with herbal &ldquo;teas&rdquo; 
&mdash; more properly called<em>decoctions</em>, but even the herbalists call 
them teas so we&rsquo;ll continue using that term too. Of course, you can also 
opt to skip acupuncture entirely, and get a consultation for herbal therapies 
only. It will take longer to resolve any imbalances, but you might decide 
acupuncture is not for you. As we left the clinic in the second part of the 
series, the clinic&rsquo;s herbalist had weighed and mixed batches of herbs for 
us to boil and drink at home.<br>
<br>
A closer inspection at home reveals that 
the term &ldquo;herbal&rdquo; is not really descriptive either, since grains, 
fruit, bark, and even what appears to be chalk, has been included in some of 
our mixes. Dr. Wong has explained that it&rsquo;s not enough to know that 
certain plants are beneficial for treating imbalances or illness, but also that 
the different parts of a plant (roots, stems, flower, fruit, leaves, inner or 
outer bark) are used for different illnesses. Even the time of day or the 
season for harvesting can affect a plant&rsquo;s medicinal properties. Further 
processing &mdash; such as drying, fermenting, cooking, and glazing with honey 
&mdash; will alter healing properties even more. Whew! Well, all we have to 
know is how to boil the mixes and when to drink them.<br>
<br>
Many cultures 
around the world have long traditions of using local herbs and other materials 
for healing. Perhaps what sets this therapy apart in China is a written record 
begun over 2000 years ago, and which now includes almost 6000 herbal 
&ldquo;prescriptions&rdquo; for various illnesses. But again, illness is 
perceived differently in TCM than in Western medicine &mdash; TCM focuses on 
the cause of illness (imbalances in the meridians) more than the manifest 
symptoms and condition (e.g., gout or migraines).<br>
</p> <br>
<br>
Boiling 
the teas requires a stainless steel or other non-reactive (i.e., not aluminum 
or copper) pot large enough to contain the herbs and at least 5-7 cups of 
water. You can also choose a ceramic teapot designed for this purpose (photo, 
left top). After several months of using the asparagus steamer (photo, left, 
bottom &mdash; hey, we believe in tools doing double duty whenever possible!) 
to boil our teas, we finally looked in to getting the special teapot. (Also, 
it&rsquo;s asparagus season now, so we needed that steamer back.)<br>
<br>
<br>

<br> It was surprisingly affordable &mdash; this 8 cup size was less than $10, 
and there are both smaller and larger sizes, as well as unglazed models. The 
first thing we did after washing the pot was to test it for lead. A simple swab 
test kit is available at City Mill, but other hardware stores might carry it 
too. Be certain to check the unglazed areas (the lid and rim of our pot, for 
instance), as well as the interior. With my suspicious nature, I even checked 
it twice. All was copacetic.<br>
<br>
To make our teas, we tip the contents of 
one bag into the pot, add the requisite amount of water and let everything 
re-hydrate for about 20 minutes. Then bring to a boil (we have to pay attention 
here because once it comes to a boil, the heat has to be turned right down) and 
let simmer until the liquid is reduced as noted in your instructions from the 
herbalist (this can take 60-90 minutes). Once the proper reduction is reached, 
we pour off the tea through a strainer (to catch any stray grains, seeds or 
twigs), then return the contents of the strainer to the pot, add more water 
(amount included in herbalist&rsquo;s notes) and boil at full boil for 20 
minutes again. The second pour is cooled to drink later or the next day.<br>

<br>These teas should be drunk on an empty stomach, and at least warm, if not 
hot. In TCM, cold liquids in general are frowned upon since it is thought they 
&ldquo;cool the stomach&rsquo;s fire&rdquo; (i.e., that they make digestion and 
absorption of nutrients more difficult). This is especially true for my 
condition which is characterized as caused by damp &mdash; I&rdquo;ve had to 
cut back on food and drinks that are physically cold (like ice cream and iced 
teas) or that have cool or cold chi properties (such as water chestnuts or 
bamboo). But, I admit, they&rsquo;ve not been eliminated ... I love ice cream. 
But I digress...<br>
<br>
We find the aroma of the teas simmering very 
pleasant, but that may have to do with the particular mixes we get, too. Not 
only are T&rsquo;s mixes very different from mine, but the combinations we get 
will change with almost every visit, too. The changes in the herbal mix reflect 
not only the progress we may or may not be making with the acupuncture, but 
also additional stresses or factors that may have come into play since the last 
clinic visit, or even changes in weather patterns! As the Islands moved from 
their wet to dry season, T&rsquo;s mixture changed at one point because the 
strong winds to which his condition is susceptible had died down.<br>
<br>
<br>

How do the teas taste? Like you would expect a medicinal decoction that&rsquo;s 
supposed to be good for you to taste &mdash; like a medicine. Unfortunately for 
him, T&rsquo;s original condition required the addition of bitter tastes to 
balance his chi, and so at first his teas were really quite hard to swallow ( 
<em>sorry for the pun</em> ). (Yes, even tastes &mdash; bitter, sweet, salty, 
sour, and spicy &mdash; affect the flow of chi in the meridians.) Our 
&ldquo;prescriptions&rdquo; always come with a handful of <em>chan pui mui</em> 
 (a 5-spice flavored dried plum that is enjoyed as a snack in many parts of 
Asia as well as here in Hawaii) to counter the bitterness or other unpleasant 
flavors that may be in the teas. &ldquo;Hold your nose, drink, then chew on a 
mui&rdquo; was his routine for a while.<br>
<br>
<br>
As his condition has 
improved, I&rsquo;ve noticed that his teas now include some kind of 
honey-dipped root or bark (the dark flat pieces that look like slate in this 
photo) that go a long way to making the teas more palatable. My condition 
requires the addition of naturally sweet things, so I&rsquo;ve been lucky to 
have some kind of sweetener like the honey bark or dried fruit as part of my 
teas. (But that doesn&rsquo;t mean I pass up on the mui afterwards!) *wink*<br>

<br>If the mui is not enough to make the tea palatable, it&rsquo;s important to 
discuss options with the herbalist. Sweetening the tea itself is not advised 
because, as with T&rsquo;s original condition, the sweetener may acutally work 
against your health objectives. And because in TCM different sweeteners also 
have different properties (brown sugar is considered warming, while honey is 
neutral), it&rsquo;s best to let your doctor or herbalist recommend 
alternatives to complement your condition.<br>
<br>
So, not your everyday sort 
of &ldquo;cuppa.&rdquo; But it can grow to be a comfortable part of a 
week&rsquo;s routine, and definitely merits satisfaction in the knowledge that 
it is a cup as unique as you are. <em>Malama pono, Everyone</em> !<br>
<br>

<p></p> 
<p><br>
<br>
</p> 
<p>And now that we&rsquo;ve shared our experiences &ldquo;under the 
needle&rdquo; and by the cupful with you, we&rsquo;d love to hear about your 
experiences with acupuncture or herbal remedies &mdash; Chinese, Ayurvedic, 
Kampo, or Grandma/Lola/Oma/Nana/Bubbie&rsquo;s time-tested home-cure for colic! 
&mdash; we&rsquo;re interested in them all!<br>

<p>We love a good fish patty. This is playing with your food in the best way 
&mdash; you can use fresh, dried or canned fish; potatoes, rice or tofu to 
bind; and any number of herb and spice combinations to evoke flavors of Asia, 
the Americas, Africa, Europe, wherever you wish! One of our favorites is a 
deep-fried fish patty, bright with the tangy flavors of wild lime and 
lemongrass. In an effort to make them healthier so we could have them more 
often, I pan-fried them with olive oil instead of deep-frying. Still tasty, but 
honestly, it wasn&rsquo;t soul-satisfying the way the deep-fried version is. 
So, I guess, like so many things, you have to choose your poison ...<br>
</p> 
<br> <br>
This recipe starts with fresh fish (this time we used frozen mahi), 
but if saltcod were not so expensive here, I would love to try this again with 
that. The two mostprominent aromatics in this &mdash; the wild lime leaves and 
lemongrass &mdash; are available in many groceries now (as well as ethnic 
markets), and they freeze very well. So buy them when you see them, and freeze 
until needed. Just wash and dry the leaves, and store in a zippered plastic bag 
in the freezer. The lemongrass can be washed, and the tough outer leaves 
removed and trimmed, then zippered and frozen.<br>
<br>
The double-lobed wild 
lime, or makrut, (in top photo) is more widely known by the unfortunate 
moniker, &ldquo;kaffir&rdquo; &mdash; which evidently carries quite a bit of 
historical baggage as a derogatory and offensive term for black Africans, or to 
denote something as inferior. From <em> The Oxford Companion to Food, 
University Press, 1999. page 424:</em> <br>

<blockquote> 
<p>&ldquo;Kaffir: an epithet which has been used, especially in southern 
Africa, of certain plant foods, for which it is now preferable to use names 
less likely to cause offense... In southern Africa the term came to mean what 
would now be called &lsquo;black African&rsquo;, sometimes applying to a 
particular group and sometimes in a general sense. In most contexts it now has 
a pejorative sense, to such an extent that its use can be actionable in S. 
Africa ... Since the fruit in question is of some importance in a number of SE 
Asian cuisines, it is in books about them that one is most apt to find 
references to it ... it would be a reasonable assumption that the term has its 
origin in southern Africa and may have reached Malaysia and Indonesia from 
there through the Cape Malays, and then travelled westwards to Thailand.&rdquo;
</p> </blockquote> <br>
The description of the the lime itself is listed in the 
OCF under &ldquo;Makrut Lime.&rdquo; We use the term &ldquo;wild lime,&rdquo; 
borrowed from Alford &amp; Duguid&rsquo;s <em>Hot Sour Salty Sweet.</em> <em>
<br></em> <br>
Whenever we want to have these or any type of fish patty, 
I&rsquo;ve always had to plan to have mashed potatoes around, which can be a 
hindrance if you don&rsquo;t want to take the extra step of mashing potatoes 
just for this. On a whim once, I substituted cold cooked rice for the potatoes 
and the results were really good. I prefer the potatoes because I like the 
creamy texture they provide, but T prefers the rice texture, which was firmer. 
These are a bite-size version that make a great buffet dish or appetizer. You 
can shape them larger, for an entree- or bun-sized patty; but for a 
&ldquo;burger&rdquo; size, I would add 2-3 teaspoons of the sweet chili sauce 
(used as a dip here) into the mix before shaping and cooking. <em><br>
</em> 
<br> <em><br>
</em> MAHIMAHI PATTIES W/ LEMONGRASS &amp; LIME LEAF<br>
Makes 
24-30 appetizer patties<br>
<br>
1 lb. (455g) mahi fillets, or any firm white 
fish, bones and pins removed<br>
small handful (about 4 oz/110g) of snow peas, 
de-veined and julienned<br>
1/2 small carrot, peeled and finely grated 
(optional)<br>
1 stalk lemongrass, peeled and minced<br>
1 wild lime leaf (2 
lobes), de-veined and minced<br>
1 bird&rsquo;s eye chili (donne or boonie 
pepper), seeded and minced<br>
1/4-1/2 tsp. raw sugar (will depend if fish 
sauce used already contains sugar, check label)<br>
<br>
Roughly chop 3/4 of 
fish, and place in small food processor bowl. Chop remaining 1/4 of fish into 
pieces no larger than 1/2 inch. Add half of snow peas and carrots, and all of 
lemongrass, lime leaf and chili to processor, and very briefly pulse to 
combine. Remove contents of processor to mixing bowl, and add remaining finely 
chopped fish and vegetables.<br>
<br>
1-2 TBL. fish sauce (will depend on brand 
and country of origin, Vietnamese brands are saltier and more pungent than 
Thai, Filipino or other brands)<br>
few sprigs of cilantro, finely minced 
(about 1 TBL)<br>
1 cup (210g) mashed potatoes, or cooled cooked rice <br>
1 
large egg, beaten<br>
<br>
Add fish sauce and cilantro to mixed fish, and knead 
well to combine flavors. Add mashed potato and egg, and knead through again. 
Set aside for at least 30 minutes.<br>
<br>
Preheat skillet over medium-high 
heat. Pre-heat toaster oven to 300F.<br>
<br>
Shape mixture into 2&rdquo; oval 
patties. Add 2-3 TBL. olive oil to coat pan well, and fry patties about 3-4 
minutes on each side. Keep warm in toaster oven until all patties are cooked.
<br><br>
You can also deep-fry these patties, but dust them with corn or potato 
starch before frying.<br>
<br>
Serve with fresh lime and sweet chili sauce 
(available commercially, or try this version  from Recipezaar). With potatoes 
in the mixture, these do not freeze well since the potatoes develop a mealy 
texture when thawed. Haven&rsquo;t tried freezing the version with rice yet...

<h1>Going Naked: Crustless Quiche w/Asparagus, Cress &amp; Surimi</h1>  June06 
2008 
<p><br>
</p> 
<p>A summer brunch dish that tastes naughty, but is nicer to your figure and 
heart than its pastry-enrobed sibling. Quiche by its nature is not a 
dieter&rsquo;s friend &mdash; flaky pastry, butter, heavy cream, eggs, and 
cheese can wreak havoc on the waist and the cholesterol count. But here&rsquo;s 
the thing: we like eggs, we like cream, and we lo-o-ve cheese, but don&rsquo;t 
like the &ldquo;fat-free&rdquo; versions of anything. I even begrudge low-fat 
versions.<br>
<br>
But there are choices we can make that allow us to indulge 
in a Sunday treat like this without resorting to fat-free products &mdash; 
eliminating the crust, using egg whites in place of some of the whole eggs in 
the recipe, using light cream and yogurt instead of heavy cream, and using half 
the amount of cheese and twice the amount of vegetables. I&rsquo;m not a 
dietician, and I don&rsquo;t know if we can call this &ldquo;healthy&rdquo; but 
it&rsquo;s at least healthi<em>er.</em> <br>
</p> <br>
<br>
For this quiche we 
used surimi, more widely known, unfortunately, as &ldquo;fake crab.&rdquo; I 
guess I had surimi on the brain because I just received a monthly update from a 
well-known cooking magazine, wherein surimi was roundly rejected as a poor 
substitute for crabmeat. Of course. It&rsquo;s <em>not</em>  crabmeat, 
it&rsquo;s fishcake. One reason I dislike the term &ldquo;fake crab&rdquo; is 
that the term implies that surimi can be used interchangeably with real 
crabmeat, and of course, it can&rsquo;t. The magazine article reviewed surimi 
as a substitute for crab in making crabcakes! Are you kidding me, <em>
crabcakes?!</em>  Honestly, reading this gave me a headache. There was no 
mention of a proper use of surimi, or it&rsquo;s use for hundreds of years in 
China, Japan, Korea and all over Asia. Nothing. Just, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t use it 
to make crabcakes.&rdquo; Okay, thanks. Noted. Once I stopped hyperventilating 
and huffing around the kitchen, I refelcted on the poor examples of surimi 
being used as if it actually <em>were</em>  a substitue for crab &mdash; you 
know them, too, the pasta salads, omelets, sandwiches, and sushi touted as 
&ldquo;crab,&rdquo; without the the quotation marks.<br>
<br>
<br>
So what, 
exactly, is surimi? It&rsquo;s the name for both the raw fish paste that is 
used to make a variety of different fishcakes, and the red-and-white stick 
fishcake with that unhelpful &ldquo;fake crab (or lobster)&rdquo; label. Surimi 
paste is seasoned and shaped according to different cultural preferences across 
Asia. In Japan, products made from surimi are called <em>Kamaboko </em> 
(kah-mah-BO-ko), and the variety of shapes, colors, additional ingredients are 
many &mdash; tubes, sticks, half moons, patties; stuffed, hollow, plain, with 
vegetables; brown, white, neon pink or green. The other day we tried a 
wonderful kamaboko from Japan with actual pieces of snow crabmeat in it; it was 
the perfect complement to the homemade broth, fresh noodles and vegetables in 
our ramen lunch. The stick surimi used in this quiche has a distinctive 
bundled-threadlike appearance. It pulls apart easily in long strips the way 
string cheese does (photo above). I remember having to do this as a kid to help 
my mom prepare omelets or somen salads. Whenever I use the stick surimi, I 
still immediately shred it like this. Habit, I guess.<br>
<br>
Whether you 
chunk it or shred it, I hope you give surimi a chance, and use it for what it 
is &mdash; a tasty fishcake that can lighten and liven up your meals in its own 
right. Hawaii is lucky to have several kamaboko manufacturers, and we know of 
one local purveyor of Taiwanese-style fishballs that (they advertise) is made 
fresh daily from kajiki (aka blue marlin; most commercial fishcake in the U.S. 
is made of pollock or whiting) (see Chinatown Buys ). But save those goodies 
for the stews , soups and fried noodles, for this recipe you&rsquo;ll need the 
shredding kind.<br>
<br>
CRUSTLESS QUICHE w/ASPARAGUS, CRESS &amp; SURIMI<br>

<em>The key to making a creamy quiche is &ldquo;low and slow&rdquo; &mdash; 
it&rsquo;s basically a savory custard, so treat it with the same gentleness of 
whisk and heat with which you pamper a flan, bread pudding, or creme anglaise.
</em> <br>
(Serves 2)<br>
<br>
Pre-heat oven to 350F/180C.<br>
<br>
For the 
custard:<br>
handful of garlic chives (about 20g), chopped fine<br>
1 TBL. 
unsalted butter<br>
<br>
Saute the chives in butter over medium heat until they 
just become fragrant. Keep aside.<br>
<br>
6 large eggs (3 whole and 3 egg 
whites only)<br>
1/2 cup (120ml) light cream or half-and-half<br>
3 TBL. plain 
yogurt<br>
2 TBL. mirin (seasoned rice wine for cooking), or dry sherry<br>
1/2 
tsp. dried chervil<br>
sea salt<br>
white pepper<br>
one pass of nutmeg on a 
grater (over custard)<br>
<br>
Whisk together the egg whites and whole eggs 
until thoroughly blended. Add cream, <em>yogurt</em>  and mirin, and whisk 
again, being careful not to incorporate too much air. Add sauteed chives, 
chervil and seasonings, to taste. Grate nutmeg over custard. Stir to 
incorporate.<br>
<br>
For the filling:<br>
12 stalks of cooked asparagus, 
preferably grilled, cut into 1&rdquo; pieces (can keep a few whole to decorate 
the top)<br>
 (I used steamed asparagus, and even after a gentle squeeze and 
paper toweling, they still gave off liquid as the quiche cooked and left the 
filling looking like soft-cooked eggs even though the egg is cooked through)<br>
1/2 cup flash-cooked watercress, squeezed dry and chopped<br>
4 sticks of 
surimi, pat dry and pulled into shreds<br>
1/2 cup (55g) grated mozzarella<br>

<br><br>
Fill a 4-cup/1L baking dish with the vegetables and surimi, 
distributing them evenly in the dish. Add cheese. Slowly pour custard over 
fillings, lifting ingredients at the bottom slightly to make certain the 
custard gets all the way down to the bottom and covers the vegetables. Gently 
tap dish on counter to release bubbles and settle the custard.<br>
<br>
REDUCE 
HEAT to 325F/160C. Place baking pan in oven and cook for 40-45 minutes, or 
until top is pale golden and a knife inserted in the middle comes out moist, 
but with no film of egg on it. Remove quiche from oven, cover and allow to set 
for at least 20 minutes in the pan before slicing. Custard will continue to 
cook as it sets.<br>
<br>
Note: Cooking time is for a 4-cup/1L baking dish. If 
using a larger baking vessel (where the custard spreads out more), check the 
quiche after 30 minutes. If it still needs time, cover lightly with foil and 
keep checking at 5 minute intervals. If using a smaller baking dish (filling is 
more than 3&rdquo; deep), keep temperature at 325F/160C, lightly cover top of 
quiche with foil after 30 minutes, and cook for a total of 50 minutes to 1 
hour. Test with knife, as above.<br>

<h1>Preserved Lemon &amp; Almond Polenta Torta</h1>  June02 2008 <br>

They&rsquo;re ready, at last. The lemons have transformed and are ready to play 
with. But how? We&rsquo;ve seen them in a savory dish,Chicken with Preserved 
Lemons &amp; Olives, but how do they fare in sweets? <br>
<br>
I went on a 
search for a lemon almond polenta torta many years ago after reading about a 
production of the play, &ldquo;Dinner with Friends,&rdquo; in which this cake 
plays a starring role. The play (now also a movie) is about a food-writing 
couple, just returned from vacationing in Italy, who want to re-create some of 
the wonderful meals they enjoyed during their travels with their two closest 
friends, another couple. During the dessert course, trouble ensues. Anyway, the 
director in the review I was reading raves about the authentic lemon almond 
polenta cake he baked for his cast, but doesn&rsquo;t actually offer a recipe, 
and so I searched.<br>
<br>
I came across this dense Italian version in the <em>
Boston Globe, f</em>eatured in a story that was actually about olive oil, and 
using olive oil in place of butter in baking sweets. It was a novel concept to 
me at the time, but one I&rsquo;ve since adopted for much of our cake baking. 
But this was the recipe that started it all. It was intriguing in so many ways, 
it contained no flour, no butter, and used an entire lemon &mdash; pith, pulp 
and peel! The final result is bright, lemony, dense and decadent cake.The <em>
Globe</em>  article quotes American-born pastry chef, Faith Willinger saying, 
&ldquo;People use olive oil because it is healthier [than the alternatives], 
and it lets the genuine flavors stand up for what they are. Butter coats the 
whole palate and makes everything sweeter. Olive oil complements, rather than 
hides, flavor.&quot; Chef Willinger has taught cooking classes and writes about 
food for over 25 years from her home base in Florence.<br>
<br>
To celebrate 
the end of our five weeks of patience, it seemed appropriate to use these 
precious lemons for a cake. By the way, last week I found preserved lemons in a 
local supermarket: it was over $10 a bottle for 2 small lemons! It&rsquo;s so 
easy to make at home, I hope more people try this themselves. (Learn how) <br>

<br>Since the lemons are preserved in salt, I simply elminated the salt in the 
original recipe. I also used some of the olive oil that was sealing the lemon 
brine to make up part of the olive oil used in the recipe (and topped off the 
lemon jar with additional oil), but that&rsquo;s optional. I did use the almond 
extract this time, as I had done with the original raw lemon version, but I 
would not use it again if using preservd lemons. With the raw lemon, the 
extract blended well with the bright citrus in the lemon; but the preserved 
lemon gave the cake a rounder lemon flavor, still intense but without the 
acidity, and the extract is noticeably distinct and remains apart from the 
lemon. The biggest difference for me is this: I can enjoy the preserved lemon 
version with coffee, something I couldn&rsquo;t do with the original. Again, 
it&rsquo;s the acidity. I have to admit that I don&rsquo;t like the combination 
of coffee and citrus &mdash; the citrus changes the taste of my lovely coffee 
(black, no sugar so other flavors really affect it). However, with the volatile 
oils softened after 5 weeks in brine, I can enjoy the lemon flavor in the cake 
and still savor my coffee. The two versions are different enough that I would 
consider serving them at different times, different occasions &mdash; the 
original for a Sunday brunch, served with iced or hot tea, and maybe a shot of 
Limoncello, or even a lemonade; the preserved version after dinner, with coffee 
and later a digestif.<br>
<br>
<br>
That&rsquo;s what food always comes back 
to, isn&rsquo;t it &mdash; creating your best for family and friends. And with 
that thought, this cake goes with our love and prayers to Briana Brownlow at
Figs with Bri, via Jugalbandi&rsquo;s special CLICK event for June &mdash; a 
yellow culinary theme that doubles as a fundraiser to help Bri meet her costs 
for medical treatments. Normally Bri creates with and writes about organic 
foods on her site, but understandably is focusing her considerable energy on 
this<strong><em>second</em></strong> bout with breast cancer that has 
mestatasized into her lungs and lymph nodes.Jugalbandi&rsquo;s bee and Jai have 
organized an account payable directly to Bri to allow her to explore medical 
options that her insurance company refuses to cover. They are asking for $25 
donations from 500 people to help Bri cover these costs. If you would like to 
help, and to learn more about Bri&rsquo;s fight, visitJugalbandi or Figs with 
Bri. <br>
<br>
Take care, dear Bri, and God Bless! <br>

PRESERVED 
LEMON &amp; ALMOND POLENTA TORTA<br>
(adapted from the <em>Boston Globe</em> , 
Oct. 15, 2003) <br>
4-6 pieces of preserved lemon, enough to equal one whole 
lemon<br>
1/2 cup (85g) cornmeal <br>
2 tsp baking powder <br>
1-1/4 cups 
(250g) blanched almonds<br>
1 + 1/4 (190g + 48g) cups raw sugar (coarse 
granulated or demerara)<br>
1/2 cup (120ml) fruity olive oil (optional: use 
some from the top of the preserved lemons)<br>
1/2 cup (120ml) evaporated milk 
<br>2 large eggs <br>
1/2 teaspoon almond extract (optional) <br>

Confectioners' sugar, for garnish<br>
Drained full-fat yogurt, for garnish <br>

<br>Pre-heat oven tp 350F/180C. <br>
<br>
Oil a 9-inch round cake pan, line 
with wax or parchment paper cut to fit, and oil the paper.<br>
<br>
In a bowl 
mix together the cornmeal and baking powder.<br>
<br>
In a food processor, 
pulse the almonds with<strong>1 cup</strong> of sugar to make a slightly coarse 
mixture.<br>
<br>
Cut each preserved lemon piece in half, and remove any 
remaining seeds. Add to the ground almond mixture. Pulse again until the 
mixture forms a heavy puree. Taste for sweetness and add the remaining 1/4 cup 
of sugar, if necessary. Add the oil, milk, eggs, and (if using) almond extract. 
Process for 1 to 2 minutes or until just combined. Add the cornmeal mixture and 
pulse just briefly to combine.<br>
<br>
Pour batter into the prepared pan and 
bake for 55 to 60 minutes or until golden brown and slightly moist in the 
center.<br>
<br>
Transfer to a wire rack to cool. Run a knife around the cake, 
invert it onto a cake plate, then invert back onto another plate so the baked 
side is on top. Dust with confectioners' sugar. Serve with drained yogurt and 
fresh fruit, if desired. The original is served with ricotta cream, see<em>
Boston Globe</em> article for recipe. <br>

<h1>Green Tea Shortbread</h1>  May29 2008 <br>
<br>
We do love green tea. Hot 
or iced, in cakes, ice cream, custard, cookies &mdash; it&rsquo;s all good. We 
drink almost all teas &mdash; green or black &mdash; without sugar; more by 
habit than for health. With sweets, though, we both agree that the best part of 
the earthy, herbaceous flavor of green tea is that hint of bitterness that 
comes through just before the sweet awakens the taste buds. Lovely.<br>
<br>

With the advent of medical studies touting the anti-oxidant benefits of green 
tea, it&rsquo;s been wonderful to see the spread of green tea consumption and 
green tea flavored goodies on menus and supermarket shelves. I see that a wave 
of Matcha Cookies hit the blogosphere last year and went right around the 
world! I first came across an entry for a green tea flavored cookie in 
Obachan&rsquo;s Kitchen , one which she had made a few years earlier, but had 
noted that she was not satisfied with the recipe. I went back to the standard 
shortbread recipe we usually use (confession: I last made these in 2001) and 
decided to substitute part of the flour with ground green tea powder and see 
what happened. Besides, I got to use one of my favorite kitchen gadgets, too.
<br> <br>
<br>
For this recipe I did not use matcha, I used ground green tea 
leaves. Matcha is a specific grade of green tea that has been ground to powder 
for use in the traditional Japanese tea ceremony, and is prized for its 
astringent quality. I used home-grade green tea leaves and ground them at home 
in a ceramic grater. A local Japanese department store (Shirokiya) sells this 
grater for home tea brewing, especially for cold brewing. I received one as a 
present a couple of years ago, and I love it. It&rsquo;s nice to be able to add 
green tea powder as a condiment and flavoring agent to many different foods, 
like these cookies. Otherwise, you can purchase &ldquo;matcha powder for 
cooking&rdquo; (which I suspect is the same grade of green tea we used here), 
and actual matcha in gourmet shops, tea shops and on-line.<br>
<br>
In adapting 
our shortbread recipe, I heeded Obachan&rsquo;s note that more than 2 teaspoons 
of matcha per 100g of flour would be too bitter, and so only used 2 teaspoons 
in this batch. The resulting shortbread had the wonderful color and pleasing 
flavor of green tea, but was a tad too sweet for my taste, even without the 
extra sugar topping. One of the reasons I make shortbread so rarely is that you 
really can&rsquo;t cut down on the ratio of sugar to butter without sacrificing 
shortbread&rsquo;s melt-in-your-mouth quality; whereas with other cookies, I 
often cut down the amount of sugar in the recipe by 1/4 to 1/3. I think most 
people would find the balance between green tea and sugar in the recipe below 
just right, especially if served with a pot of <em>ocha </em> (Japanese green 
tea). Since I&rsquo;m using green tea powder instead of real matcha, next time 
I would risk replacing another teaspoon of flour with green tea. It&rsquo;s not 
something I would advise other bakers to do unless they are looking for a 
bitter edge in their shortbread.<br>
<br>
GREEN TEA SHORTBREAD<br>
Makes about 
24 cookies<br>
**1/2 cup (or U.S. 1 stick) (110g) unsalted butter (no 
substitutes)<br>
4-1/2 TBL. (55g) fine granulated sugar (aka caster, not 
powdered)<br>
1/4 tsp. sea salt<br>
1 cup (100g) all purpose flour<br>
2 tsp. 
green tea powder<br>
1/3 cup (55g) mochiko (glutinous rice four) or semolina<br>
<br>extra sugar for crunchy topping (optional)<br>
<br>
 **Update (01/06/09): 
With thanks to Nat for pointing out that the butter equivalencies originally 
were not correct -- the metric was correct, but the U.S. equivalent was off by 
half. My apologies to anyone who followed the U.S. measure and whose shortbread 
was too dry.<br>
<br>
Beat butter until softened. Add sugar and beat together 
on low until the sugar is just incorporated (will still feel grainy).<br>

Combine flour, green tea powder, salt and mochiko together. Add to butter 
mixture and stir well by hand to make a smooth paste, do not overwork the dough 
or your shortbread will come out like a brick.<br>
<br>
Either roll into a log 
1.5 inches in diameter, wrap in plastic wrap and chill (to make button cookies, 
as shown here); or flatten into a disc between two sheets of plastic wrap to a 
thickness of 1/2 inch and chill (to cut our shapes). Chill for 20 minutes.<br>

<br>Pre-heat oven to 325F/170C.<br>
<br>
To make buttons, slice log into 
1/2-inch pieces.<br>
<br>
Or use your favorite small cookie cutter to stamp out 
shapes. Gently re-roll, flatten and chill before stamping out more.<br>
<br>

<br> (Optional garnish) Place 2-3 TBL. of sugar on a small plate. Gently press 
one side of the cookie in sugar, and lay sugar side up on an ungreased baking 
sheet.<br>
<br>
If cookies start to look shiny, place sheet in fridge for 5 
minutes before baking. Bake in pre-heated oven for 10-12 minutes. To check for 
doneness, look for opaqueness and a sandy quality in the cookies (see photo, 
right, for raw and cooked cookie comparison), and you will smell butter and 
green tea. They will still feel a little soft when hot, but will harden a bit 
on cooling. Do not over-bake or they will transform into miniature 
papaerweights. Because of the high ratio of sugar to butterfat, these cookies 
will keep their tender crumb.<br>
<br>
Cool completely on wire rack. Store in 
air-tight container at room temperature for up to one week.<br>

<h1>Taro Crepe w/Fried Saba Bananas &amp; Tsubushi-An </h1>  May27 2008 <br>

<br> This angular squat banana is known as the saba banana ( <em>Musa 
paradisiaca</em> ) &mdash; a varietal that must be cooked before eating. I 
prefer it when it's still firm-ripe, as in this photo, if we're using it for 
grilling or pan-frying, but many people will say it should already have black 
spots and be much softer before cooking. I'm guessing there are many folks who 
have tasted saba bananas and maybe not realized it. It's often used in Filipino 
sweets &mdash; either rolled in sugar, wrapped as a lumpia and deep-fried <em>
(turon</em> ), or found with sweet potatoes and pillow-light mochi balls in the 
soupy, coconutty dessert <em>ginataan</em> . Honestly, I like them best 
pan-fried with a little butter, either with other sweet things like french 
toast or pancakes, or with savory foods like eggs, rice and sausage, or a stew. 
Whichever way it's eaten, I think of saba bananas as part of my Filipino 
heritage, though I'm sure many other Southeast Asian cuisines utilize them as 
well. A couple of weeks ago, I wanted to do something a little different for a 
lazy weekend breakfast. A check of pantry and fridge turned up sweetened 
drained yogurt that was on its way to becoming an Indian dessert ( <em>shrikand
</em> ) but instead was hijacked for this recipe, some homemade sweet azukii 
bean filling (tsubushi-an), and some instant taro pancake mix that needed to be 
used. The result? Pan-Pacific melding at its sweet best: taro crepes filled 
with buttery pan-fried saba (the bananas, not the mackerel), pandan-flavored 
sweet beans, and a dollop of thick sweetened yogurt.<br>
<br>
Since this came 
together more by chance than by design, we were surprised just how good the 
combination was! With or without the pandan essence, the nutty flavor of the 
beans and their firm bite were a great contrast to the soft, apple-citrus 
essence and caramelized flavor of the cooked banana. Japanese-style sweetened 
azuki bean paste comes in 2 styles: smooth (called <em>koshi an</em> , short for
<em>anko</em> ) or coarsely mashed, with pieces of whole bean (called <em>
tsubushi an</em> ). I always prefer textures that have a bite to them (chunky 
vs. smooth peanut butter, or smashed vs whipped potatoes, etc.), and I think 
the nutty quality that comes through with the pieces of whole beans in the 
tsubushi are key here.<br>
<br>
<br>
As for the crepe, taro/poi adds a pleasing 
chewiness and elasticity to the crepe, as well as its tell-tale violet hue, but 
not really a distinct flavor. It made for a very forgiving medium with which to 
practice my &quot;pour-swish-flip&quot; crepe-making technique. Normally I lose 
every third or fourth crepe to tears or rips as I try to flip them, but this 
time every single one was a winner. The yogurt was truly an after-thought 
&mdash; I was wishing we had creme fraiche or heavy whipping cream to top off 
the crepe, and used the drained plain yogurt, hastily sweetened, as a stand-in. 
I ended up loving the way the yogurt's tangy underbite contrasted with the 
different sweet flavors of the fruit and beans, and its heavier texture 
retained its creaminess when creme or cream would have long dissolved into 
sweet dairy puddles.<br>
<br>
TARO CREPES WITH FRIED SABA BANANAS &amp; 
TSUBUSHI-AN<br>
(makes 5-6 crepes total)<br>
For the crepes:<br>
1 cup Taro 
Brand taro pancake mix<br>
2 cups cold water<br>
oil for pan<br>
<br>
Combine 
pancake mix and water. Stir well to eliminate all lumps. Batter should be a 
very thin pouring consistency, add more water as necessary.<br>
<br>
Lightly 
oil a seasoned 10-inch skillet or crepe pan with an oiled paper towel. Heat 
well over medium heat. Pour 1/2 cup batter into pan and immediately swirl 
batter to cover bottom of pan in a thin film. Cook until batter is set and dry 
to the touch. Carefully flip over and cook for another 5 seconds. Remove to 
plate, and while warm, roll pancake (jelly-roll style) and allow to cool while 
rest of the batter is used up. Cover with a clean kitchen towel. Rolling the 
crepes while warm will prevent splitting when they are filled later. Use within 
an hour of making.<br>
<br>
For the bananas:<br>
5 saba bananas, washed<br>

unsalted butter<br>
<br>
To peel, cut off the top and tail of the banana, then 
make a cut lengthwise through the peel. Remove peel. Slice lengthwise.<br>
<br>

Pre-heat a small skillet or cast-iron pan over medium heat. When heated well, 
add a teaspoon or more of butter (depends on how decadent you are) to pan, then 
the sliced bananas, cut-side down. Cook for 6-7 minutes, or just until the 
banana caramelizes, then turn over for another 2-3 minutes or until the fruit 
takes on a translucent quality. Remove to plate to cool. Slice again lengthwise 
into quarters.<br>
<br>
To Assemble:<br>
1 cup of prepared tsubushi an ( recipe 
minus pandan essence on Recipezaar ) or store-bought<br>
 (add <em>1 drop</em>  
[a little goes a long way] of pandan essence to 1 cup of prepared anko if you 
want to experiment with this version)<br>
1/2 cup drained plain full-fat yogurt 
sweetened with 1 tsp. sugar, or creme fraiche<br>
<br>
Unroll finished crepe. 
Fill with 1-2 TBL. anko. Place 3-4 banana slices on anko, then fold over one 
end of the crepe to hold in fillings. Finish by rolling crepe to close. Garnish 
with a dollop of yogurt or creme fraiche and mint, or a dusting of powdered 
sugar.<br>
<br>
Serve with Portuguese sausage for a real multi-cultural 
breakfast feast.<br>

<h1>Sariwa! (Filipino Fresh Lumpia)</h1>  May20 2008  I stand corrected! <br>

Thank you to reader Ezra Antonio for his comments regarding the correct 
spelling of this dish (see his comments below). I've edited this to reflect 
this spelling with an &quot;R&quot; instead of how our family mispronounces it 
with an &quot;L&quot; &mdash; some of us are still working on the &quot;P&quot; 
and &quot;F&quot; thing, too! I love it when there's a dialogue about something 
you see around here &mdash; thanks to everyone who de-lurks! ; )<br>
<br>

<p><br>
</p> 
<p>No doubt many readers are familiar with the Chinese eggroll, the Vietnamese 
fried springroll, or (if you're really lucky) the Filipino lumpia. They are all 
deep-fried packets of vegetables and/or meat beloved the world over as tasty, 
easy-to-eat parcels of exotica. Fewer readers may also be familiar with the 
Vietnamese fresh springroll &mdash; a noodle, herb and cooked shrimp filling 
wrapped in translucent rice paper. Definitely saves on calories (no frying) 
with no sacrifice of flavor. Now raise your hand if you're also familiar with 
the Filipino fresh lumpia called Lumpia Sariwa, or Saliwa. Anyone?<em>Anyone??
</em><br>
</p> <br>
<br>
I think it's a tragedy that this wonderful Filipino 
dish is not better known, so let's change that. Sariwa is full of healthy 
ingredients, fun to assemble, and oh-so-onolicious. The vegetable and meat 
filling is spooned into lettuce and a lumpia wrapper, rolled, and eaten with a 
sweet vinegar sauce and fresh garlic. How can it get better than that? And each 
diner assembles her own wrap at the table, so everyone can adjust the garlic 
and sauce to their taste. Have you ever had mu shu pork/vegetables, or fajitas 
&mdash; it's just like that.<br>
<br>
Perhaps the single defining feature of 
sariwa is the raw garlic garnish. Finely minced raw garlic is added to each 
mouthful, along with a spoonful of vinegar sauce. It packs a powerful punch, 
but pulls together the flavorful filling and the bland wrapper and lettuce 
beautifully. If you prefer to assemble the rolls ahead of time for your family 
or guests, wrap the assembled rolls in plastic wrap, individually or in 2s and 
3s, to keep the delicate flour wrappers from drying out and splitting.<br>
<br>

<br> <br>
Maybe the trickiest part of making sariwa at home is finding the 
lumpia wrappers if you don't have a grocer that stocks Filipino products. While 
you can substitute other types of eggroll/springroll wrappers when deep-frying, 
the thicker yellowish square wrappers labelled for Chinese eggrolls won't work 
in this recipe because I don't think you can eat those wrappers raw. The 
ultra-thin crepe-like wrappers necessary for sariwa are made with flour, water 
and salt only. There is a locally (Hawaii) made brand, and a couple imported 
from the P.I. All brands are available frozen (Don Quijote on Oahu carries a 
couple of types; but the Philippine grocery, Pacific Supermarket in Waipahu, 
has the most variety). Remove the frozen wrappers from the plastic, and wrap in 
a barely damp clean kitchen towel to thaw about 30 minutes. Before placing at 
the table, carefully separate the wrappers (they're fragile and will stick 
together a bit) before stacking again in a damp towel to keep them from drying 
out.<br>
<br>
Sariwa is usually part of a larger meal, but we often will have 
just this and a bowl of rice as a full meal. It's perfect hot weather food, and 
a nice change of pace from a main-course salad.<br>
The title of this post is a 
tribute to my dear husband who always speaks in exclamation points whenever he 
mentions this dish...<br>
<br>
<br>
LUMPIA SARIWA (FILIPINO FRESH LUMPIA)<br>

Serves 4 as a main course<br>
For the Sauce:<br>
3/4 cup (180ml) apple cider 
vinegar<br>
1/2 cup (120ml) water<br>
1/2 cup (100g) brown sugar or 2/3 cup 
(130g) raw sugar<br>
1/2 tsp. sea salt<br>
3 tsp. (10g) cornstarch, dissolved 
in 3 TBL. water to make a runny paste<br>
<br>
<br>
Combine vinegar, water, 
sugar and salt in small saucepan. Stir vigorously to dissolve salt and sugar. 
Bring to boil over high heat, then immediately reduce to simmer. While stirring 
constantly or whisking, pour in cornstarch slurry and combine. Cook over low 
heat, stirring, until starch is cooked through, about 8-10 minutes, or until 
the sauce thickens and loses all opaqueness. Pour into small serving bowls (one 
for each diner) and allow to cool.<br>
<br>
For the Filling:<br>
1/4 lb. (110g) 
shrimp, peeled and deveined<br>
1 whole chicken breast or 3 chicken thighs, 
deboned and skinned<br>
1/4 lb. pork shoulder<br>
1 onion, finely diced<br>
4-6 
cloves of garlic, finely minced<br>
ground black pepper<br>
1/2 tsp. fish sauce 
(patis)<br>
oil<br>
<br>
Cut shrimp and meats into thin slivers, no more than 
1&quot; long. Heat oil in wok over medium heat, then add onions, cover and 
allow to cook until onions are translucent, about 8-10 minutes. Add garlic and 
cook until fragrant. Increase heat to medium-high and add chicken and pork. 
Season with pepper and patis, and cook for 5 minutes. Add shrimp, stir through, 
and lower heat back down to medium, and cook for another minute. Immediately 
pour out all contents of the pan, including any liquids, into a bowl and keep 
aside. Do not wash wok and return to stove.<br>
<br>
1 small head of cabbage, 
green or Napa (about 1.5 lb/600g), shredded<br>
1 large or 2 medium carrots, 
julienned in 2&quot; pieces or shredded<br>
1/4 lb. green beans, cleaned and 
julienned or sliced on a sharp diagonal<br>
1 medium potato, peeled and 
julienned in 2&quot; pieces<br>
1 small can of water chestnuts, julienned 
(optional)<br>
1/2 cup of julienned bamboo shoots<br>
3 pieces of Chinese black 
fungus (mok yee), rehydrated and sliced thin (optional)<br>
ground black pepper
<br>2-3 tsp. patis<br>
1/4 cup chicken broth or water<br>
<br>
In same pan that 
the meats were cooked, heat 2 TBL. oil over medium high heat, and add all the 
vegetables. Stir through, add pan juices from cooked meats and chicken broth or 
water. Cover, reduce heat to medium and cook for 10 minutes. Add pepper and 
patis, and stir through again. Continue cooking until all vegetables are just 
cooked through, then raise heat to medium-high and add back the cooked meats. 
Stir well to combine all ingredients, and cook uncovered for another 10 minutes 
to evaporate most of the liquid in the pan. Taste and correct seasoning.<br>

Remove filling from pan, leaving behind as much remaining liquid as possible. 
Allow to cool completely before serving.<br>
<br>
To Assemble:<br>
1 packet of 
lumpia wrappers, thawed and separated, and kept under a damp kitchen towel<br>

2 heads of Romaine lettuce, or 3-4 heads of leaf lettuce, washed, dried and 
separated into leaves<br>
1-2 heads of garlic, peeled and finely minced in a 
serving bowl <br>

<p></p> 
<p><br>
</p> 
<p>Lay one wrapper on a plate and a Romaine or other leaf lettuce on top of 
the wrapper, with one end of the leaf just over the left or right edge of the 
wrapper (so it will peek out the top when it's rolled). Put 2 tablespoons of 
filling down the center of the leaf, fold the leaf around filling. Holding the 
leaf in place, fold the long end of the wrapper (nearest you) around the leaf 
&amp; filling. Now bring the bottom of the wrapper over the leaf to close up 
tha end. Start rolling away from you until you reach the end of the plate. Use 
plain water to wet the edge of the wrapper to seal.<br>
<br>
To eat, just pick 
it up burrito-style, garnish with garlic and sauce, and enjoy! (&quot;<em>Pass 
the mints, please&quot;</em>)<br>

<h1>Indian Spiced Cauliflower, Daikon &amp; Carrot Pickle</h1>  May19 2008 <br>
<br> While we're waiting on the Preserved Lemons  to finish curing, here's a 
pickle that is addictive to eat as it is easy to make. This carrot, radish and 
cauliflower pickle is tangy sweet with a mild bite of mustard from the mustard 
oil and brown mustard seeds in the brine. Similar to a chow-chow or mustard 
piccallili, or even an Italian giardinera, this flavorful veggie combo can 
serve as a side dish accent to a main meal or as a condiment or ingredient in 
other dishes. We crave it with almost every Indian meal, but also serve with 
grilled or roasted meats, and chop it up and stir into tuna, pasta and grain 
salads. For pasta, rice or grain salads, I've also used the unctuous spicy 
brine as a shortcut to making a dressing for the salad. In the photo below, 
chopped vegetable pickles and the brine were added to sweet potatoes, peas, 
pineapple and couscous to make a filling for stuffed artichokes. This is a 
pantry staple for us now, too &mdash; it's versatility seems to know no bounds!
<br> <br>
<br>
CAULIFLOWER, DAIKON &amp; CARROT PICKLE<br>
(from <em>Flavors of 
India</em>  by Madhur Jaffrey)<br>
1 cup (240ml) mustard oil<br>
1 small onion, 
finely diced<br>
1 small coin of ginger, peeled and julienned<br>
3-4 cloves of 
garlic, minced<br>
1/2 medium cauliflower, washed and divided into florets<br>

1 small daikon (1 lb/450g), peeled and cut into 1-in/2.5cm cubes<br>
2 medium 
carrots, peeled and cut into 1-in/2.5cm cubes<br>
2 tsp. garam masala<br>
1-2 
TBL cayenne pepper powder<br>
4 tsp. ground cumin<br>
2 TBL. brown mustard 
seeds, gently crushed<br>
1 TBL. kosher or sea salt<br>
2/3 cup (130g) raw sugar
<br>1/2 cup (120ml) white vinegar<br>
<br>
Heat mustard oil in wok or dutch 
oven over medium-high heat. Add onions, reduce heat to medium and cook until 
onions lightly brown. Add ginger and garlic, and stir fry 1 minute.<br>
Add 
cauliflower, daikon and carrots and fry together 1 minute. Add garam masala, 
pepper, cumin, mustard seeds and salt, and stir through. Mix sugar into 
vinegar, then add to pan. Stir through and cook for 30 seconds. Remove from 
heat, and allow to cool.<br>
<br>
Sterilize a large quart jar, and transfer 
pickle to jar. Cover with cheesecloth or paper towel secured with a rubber band 
to allow excess moisture to evaporate.. Keep jar in a dry, sunny spot for 2 
days. Occasionally shake the jars to distribute spices. On the third day, 
remove the cheesecloth and seal with a tight-fitting lid. Leave on countertop 
in a warm, sunny spot for another 4-7 days. Once pickle has soured a little, it 
is ready and can be kept in the refrigerator after use.<br>
<br>
Serve as part 
of an Indian meal, or with roasted or grilled chicken. Add to couscous, rice or 
other grains, along with vegetables of your choice to make a quick salad or 
stuffing for cooked and de-choked artichokes.<br>

<h1>Acupuncture, Part II: The Clinic Visit</h1>  May16 2008 <em>After 
receiving quite a few comments and emails about the difficulty some readers 
have with the pictures with needles, a needle-free version with the disturbing 
photos removed is provided</em> <em>here</em> <em>. The text and links are all 
the same, you will just be spared the sight of any needles!<br>
<br>
</em> <em>
Although non-TCM physicians and licensed clinicians also offer acupuncture, I 
can only speak to the experience of receiving acupuncture in the traditional 
Chinese medicine (TCM) setting.</em> <br>
<br>
Our experience began with T 
seeking relief for recurring knee pain, the result of abuse on the racquetball 
court and from jogging. Not having yet read Dr. Kidson&rsquo;s book with her 
helpful advice on finding an acupuncturist (see the Overview ), our major 
criteria at the time were that the practitioner was licensed, spoke English and 
could provide a receipt we could submit for reimbursements. Not very 
enlightened, I know, but we lucked out anyway.<br>
<br>
<br>
When you first 
enter Dr. Clara Wong&rsquo;s (D.Ac.) well-lit and air-cooled clinic on Smith 
Street, you are met with the familiar sight of the Chinese herbal pharmacy 
&mdash; a massive dark cabinet with its dozens of labelled herb- and 
spice-filled square drawers for the herbologists, and shelves of boxed patent 
medicines for over-the-counter sales. Colorful diagrams outlining acupuncture 
meridian points cover the passage from the front waiting area to the treatment 
rooms.<br>
<br>
<br>
Dr. Wong is trained in both Western and Traditional 
Chinese Medicine (TCM) with a specialty in acupuncture, but her practice in 
Hawaii is limited to acupuncture and Oriental medicine, including herbology. 
Each visit begins with a meeting with the doctor in her small office. The most 
important part of the entire visit actually takes place here, not the treatment 
rooms. As was mentioned in the earlier post, diagnosis in TCM has many facets: 
listening to the patient; gauging appearance, smell, and demeanor; examining 
the tongue; and taking the pulses. Yes, pulses, plural! In TCM, the physician 
listens for six distinct pulses in the same radial artery with which a 
Western-trained nurse will count your pulse. But even before the doctor 
gestures for you to place your wrist on her desk to check your pulses, she has 
probably already noted many things about the color and condition of your skin, 
hair, eyes and face, and your demeanor that has escaped most people&rsquo;s 
attention, including yours!<br>
<br>
Questioning usually begins on a general 
level, how do you feel? Is there anything bothering you today? Follow-up 
questions have often surprised us both by how pointed and specific they can be, 
and how they often touch on areas we haven&rsquo;t mentioned at all. If this is 
your first visit, it is appropriate to ask how long the full course of 
treatment is expected to take (for me, it is about 4-6 months with 
twice-monthly visits; for T, as long as 9 months). Prognoses will also be 
affected by how often you can come in for treatment, and how well you follow up 
your clinic visit with appropriate steps at home. The interview will often end 
with the doctor asking you to stick out your tongue &mdash; the color (pale, 
pink, gray, red, etc.), condition (dry, flaccid, wet, etc.), and coating (its 
thickness, color, spread) are important diagnostic indicators to her trained 
eye. Usually this last step serves to confirm a diagnosis the doctor has 
already reached.<br>
<br>
Before you proceed to the treatment room, you may be 
advised about steps you should take at home to assist your recovery, and asked 
whether you are willing to make and take medicinal herbs to supplement your 
treatment. This will require you to boil a jumble of assorted roots, twigs, 
seeds and leaves according to very specific guidelines. Then you have to strain 
and drink it. More on this in the next post, Brewing Teas at Home .<br>
<br>

<br>Each of the three treatment rooms has a massage table and curtain for 
privacy. You don&rsquo;t have to disrobe as long as you can expose the limb or 
body part that will require treatment (we usually just wear loose-fitting 
shirts and pants). Using disposable, stainless steel needles, Dr. Wong quickly 
and painlessly inserts each implement in place. I hate needles, and I can't 
watch the doctor perform this procedure (I usually have my eyes closed, and 
take deep breaths).<br>
<br>
What you might feel is a small sting, akin to an 
insect bite, as the needle is inserted, then maybe a tingle. Tingling 
sensations are good, but sometimes a kind of ache settles in at the insertion 
point instead &mdash; this will usually require manual stimulation of the 
needle or re-insertion at a different angle. If you&rsquo;re not familiar with 
meridians, it may be surprising to find needles at far distances from the organ 
or body part that you thought was being treated. In my case, for the stomach 
and digestive tract, I have needles in my arms and legs!<br>
<br>
After the 
doctor has inserted all the needles necessary for your treatment, one of her 
aides will connect small electrodes to each needle. This was the biggest 
surprise for T on his first visit because the first acupuncturist he had 
visited (a year earlier) had used only manual stimulation of the needles. I 
asked Dr. Wong about the voltage and she explained that the small electrical 
current provides consistent stimulation at the meridian points for the set 
time, which is more comfortable for the patient. (I have to admit that I 
usually fall asleep during the 40-minute treatments.)<br>
<br>
Each area of the 
body will have a separate meter that controls the intensity of the current. The 
aide will ask you to let her know when you begin to feel the current, then will 
slowly increase the flow until it is comfortable but still tingly. Feedback 
between patient and aide is very important here &mdash; tingling sensations are 
good, aches or sharp pain mean adjustments are necessary. I often have needles 
in my hands and on or near my feet (my needle placements are usually 
symmetrical but not always), and often a hand or foot on one side but not the 
other (it&rsquo;s always my right side), will twitch or &ldquo;jump&rdquo; (see 
photos below). Dr. Wong identified these as areas with blockage of Chi &mdash; 
the twitching is caused by the current pushing its way through the blockage 
(imagine water accumulating behind a blockage and a small amount finally 
pushing its way through; it comes out in a forceful gush on the other side). 
For me, it&rsquo;s a source of amazement how the theoretical meridians become 
concrete when you can see a physical manifestation of your condition jumping so 
vividly!<br>
<br>
Once you&rsquo;re comfortably stimulated, lights are lowered 
and a heat lamp is turned on if you feel a chill, then you are left in quiet 
peace for 30-40 minutes. At some point you may be roused and asked whether you 
are still comfortable (&quot;I was asleep!&quot;) and whether you still feel a 
tingle in each area. If tingling has subsided, the current may be increased.<br>
<br> <br>
At the end of the session, the meters are turned off and disconnected 
by an aide, but the doctor will return to remove and dispose of each needle 
herself. If she hasn&rsquo;t already discussed how to follow up treatments at 
home, Dr. Wong will often take this time to advise on appropriate home care. In 
addition to taking herbal brews, this may include foods to limit or increase in 
your diet, and appropriate types of exercise. The difference between these 
recommendations and those in Western practices is that they, like the 
diagnoses, are discussed in terms of Chi. For instance, a person with a strong 
Fire element and an excess of Yang may be told to limit red meat, and spicy 
foods and herbs, and to swim in the ocean (Water) or take walks in the woods 
(Earth) to calm the strong Fire.<br>
<br>
Both T and I usually feel very 
relaxed after a session, and &quot;lightened&quot; as if a heaviness has been 
lifted from somewhere. I sometimes feel an ache in my right arm at the site of 
one of the needle insertions. The ache will come and go depending on how active 
that arm is (am I using it for writing, typing, or stirring pots), and whether 
it is exposed to a draft or cold; it tends to dissipate after tai chi 
exercises, Reiki, and drinking my prescription &quot;tea.&quot; According to 
the doctor, these are long-standing blockages in the affected meridian and 
active meditative practices such as tai chi or Qi Gong do help to clear these 
blocks.<br>
<br>
<br>
As you return to the front room, if you&rsquo;ve agreed 
to take an herbal &ldquo;tea&rdquo; you will find small paper bags which an 
herbologist has carefully weighed and assembled containing the assortment the 
doctor has prescribed for you. Each bag will brew 1-3 doses, and each 
prescription will have specific instructions on how to boil the mixture. If 
this is your first visit, take a moment to read the directions and ask the 
herbologist any questions you may have.<br>
<br>
Now you&rsquo;re ready to 
continue your journey to better health at home. See you by the teapot in the 
next part of the series...<br>

<h1>Four Allii Tart: An Onion Pie Fit for a King</h1>  May15 2008 <br>
<br>

Washington has its Walla-Walla, and Georgia has the Vidalia, but did you know 
that Hawaii also has its own sweet onion &mdash; the Ewa Sweet. More petite 
than its Mainland cousins, the Ewa (EH-vah) Sweet can be used in any way that 
you would use a Vidalia or Walla-Walla. Low-acid and natural sweetness make it 
an ideal salad and pickling onion. In season now until June, this sweet treat 
should be savored during its short season.<br>
<br>
One of our rare favorite 
treats is a caramelized onion and chevre tart. The contrast between the 
sweetness in the long-cooked onions and the tangy goat cheese is wonderful, 
especially when chased with a crisp sauvignon blanc. We have this treat so 
rarely because cooked in the traditional way, the onions take up to 3 hours to 
fully caramelize. I wondered if we could achieve a similar sweetness with the 
sweet onions in a shorter cooking time. I wouldn't want to actually caramelize 
sweet onions because I'm afraid their innate sweetness would become cloying and 
unpalatable except in very small doses (as in a jam). We wanted to cook them 
just enough to heighten their flavor. Local leeks, garlic chives and flat 
chives were added to lend some complexity. The dough for the pastry shell is a 
classic German <em>M&uuml;rbteig</em>  &mdash; this water-less dough is easy to 
make and extremely forgiving, and bakes up to a crisp shell that can support a 
heavy filing like this one.<br>
<br>
In the end, I'd say this tart was a 
winner. I especially liked the addition of the leeks. The flavor of the garlic 
chives was not discernible, but the flat chives lent some pleasing astringency 
to the mix. I think T would still prefer the caramelized version since he loves 
the sweet &amp; burnt effect on any vegetable, but I prefer the flavors in this 
combination. Too bad the sweet onion season is so short!<br>
<br>
The name of 
this tart is a play on the Hawaiian word for the ruling class, Ali'i (with one 
'L'). Onions, leeks and chives all belong to the plant genus Allium, Latin 
plural Allii . In future we'll make the classic caramelized version and the 
Pf&auml;lzer <em>Zwiebelkuchen</em> , a custard leek tart, for comparison and 
contrast for Alliophiles everywhere.<br>
<br>
<br>
THE 4 ALLII TART<br>
(For a 
12-inch tart tin)<br>
For the Shell:<br>
1-1/4 cup (125g) regular flour <br>
1 
tsp. baking powder<br>
1/4 tsp. fine sea salt<br>
5-1/2 TBL. (70g) unsalted 
butter, cut into small dice then chilled<br>
1 extra-large (64g) egg, beaten<br>
<br>Sift together flour, salt and baking powder. Add butter pieces and blend 
well using your fingers or a pastry blender (or if you're a glutton for 
punishment, two knives). If you live in a particularly warm or humid climate, 
you may want to return the dough to refrigerator for 10-15 minutes after this 
workout. To continue, add egg and knead well to moisten all the dough until you 
have a smooth pastry. Cover with wax paper or plastic wrap, and let dough rest 
for 30 minutes.<br>
<br>
Pre-heat oven to 425F/215-220C)<br>
Roll out dough to 
a 14-inch circle (for a 12-inch tin, or at least 2 inches larger than the 
diameter of your tin). Fit dough into tin, gently pressing sides and bottom to 
fit. Trim excess dough by rolling pin over the edges of the tin. Prick bottom 
with fork, cover with parchment or doubled-wax paper and fill with a single 
layer of rice, beans or pie weights. Bake for 8-10 minutes, then remove paper 
and weights, and bake an additional 2-3 minutes, or until pale tan in color. 
Remove tart tin to rack to cool.<br>
<br>
4 Ewa Sweet onions (about 1 
lb./225g), or equivalent weight of a Mainland variety<br>
2 large leeks (about 
1lb./225g)<br>
small handful of flat chives, about 40 stems<br>
20 garlic chives
<br>1/4 cup olive oil<br>
sea salt<br>
1 tsp. caraway seeds (optional)<br>
<br>

Prepare a solution of 1/4 cup vinegar in a half-gallon of clean water in a 
non-reactive container You are going to use this to wash all the onions/chives. 
( Why use vinegar to clean vegetables? Read more in the preserving lemons post )
<br><br>
First, wash both chives in this solution and rinse them with cool 
running water. Cut into 1/2-inch pieces. Save flowering heads of the garlic 
chives as a garnish. (I saved them but forgot to put them in the picture!)<br>

<br>Rinse whole leeks in clean water to remove surface dirt, then wash them 
through the vinegar-water. Pat dry and slice cross-wise, at a slight diagonal, 
through the white and light green parts. Fill a separate container with another 
hlaf-gallon of clean water, and place the sliced leeks in the bowl. Gently 
swish through and then leave for a 5-10 minutes. Lift the leeks out of the 
water into a colander to drain. DO NOT dump out the water and leeks into the 
colander! You will put back all the loose grit and dirt that has settled to the 
bottom of the bowl! (Save the dark green parts of the leeks in the freezer for 
your next soup stock.)<br>
<br>
Last, wash the onions in the vinegar-water. 
(Why wash onions if you're going to peel them anyway? Consider where they've 
been in their long journey to your kitchen. Putting an unwashed onion &mdash; 
or any vegetable or fruit &mdash; on your cutting board is contaminating your 
hands and board before you even start.) Pat dry and thinly slice.<br>
<br>
Heat 
oil in large skillet over medium heat. Add sweet onions and leeks, stir to coat 
with oil, then cover and reduce heat to medium low. Cook for 35-40 minutes, or 
until onions have become translucent (see photo). Add both chives, sea salt and 
caraway seeds, if using, and continue cooking for 10 minutes (when adding salt, 
consider that the goat cheese contains a fair amount of salt and adjust your 
salt here). Using a slotted spoon, remove onions from pan, leaving all juices 
behind. Let cool for at least 10 minutes before assembling tart.<br>
<br>
<br>

To assemble:<br>
1 log (60g) chevre, sliced into 8 pieces<br>
ground black 
pepper<br>
<br>
Pre-heat oven to 400F/200C.<br>
<br>
Place bed of drained 
onions on pre-baked tart shell. Season well with pepper and dot with goat 
cheese. Bake tart for 15 minutes, or just until onions and cheese start to take 
on color.<br>
<br>
Garnish with reserved chive flowers and fresh pepper. Serve 
slightly warm or cold. Serves 8 as first course, or 3-4 as a meal along with a 
crisp green salad and baguette.<br>

<h1>Pan-Fried Opakapaka with Warm Spiced Cabbage Salad</h1>  May13 2008 
<p><br>
</p> 
<p>This entire meal came together in under an hour, including the time to 
defrost and marinate the fish. The ingredients for the warm salad may seem 
exotic, but dals and brown mustard seeds can often be found in the bulk section 
of well-stocked health food stores so you may not have to look too far afield 
to find what you need for this salad. It may seem an unusual way to use lentils 
and beans &mdash; to dry fry them instead of boiling them &mdash; but once you 
get a taste for the nutty crunch and spice they lend to foods you, too, will 
find reasons to serve them again! The combination of cabbage and coconut is one 
we fell in love with when we first triedBrussels Sprouts with Coconut last 
fall, so this was an easy sell even if it weren't so quick to assemble and cook.
<br></p> <br>
<br>
WARM SPICED CABBAGE SALAD<br>
3 TBL. mustard oil, or olive 
oil (not EVOO)<br>
2 tsp. channa dal<br>
2 tsp. urad dal<br>
1 tsp. brown 
mustard seeds<br>
20 fresh curry leaves (optional)<br>
1-4 serrano chiles, 
seeded and sliced<br>
3 cups finely shredded cabbage<br>
1 carrot, julienned or 
grated<br>
sea salt<br>
1/2 cup grated coconut<br>
<br>
Heat oil in wok or 
large skillet over medium high heat. Add dals and mustard seeds, and fry until 
mustard seeds start to pop (about 10 seconds). Add curry leaves, if using, and 
stir through. Add chiles<br>
and stir through, then cabbage, carrots and sea 
salt. Cover and reduce heat to low and cook until cabbage just wilts, about 
8-10 minutes. Add coconut, and stir to heat through. Turn off heat and leave 
covered until ready to serve.<br>
<br>
<br>
Crimson red snapper, known locally 
as <em>opakapaka</em> , is found in Hawaiian waters but is one of several 
species that are still under a fishing ban in the main Islands. The local 
fisheries council instituted the ban in 2006 to allow the opakapaka population 
to recover from over-fishing. The only opakapaka available here now arrives 
flash-frozen from Asia and the northern Hawaiian Islands. Of course, most 
&quot;fresh&quot; fish in supermarkets and fishmongers arrives frozen, and what 
we are buying is actually thawed fish. As long as frozen fish is protected from 
freezer burn, as with these shrink-wrapped individual fillets, you can always 
have &quot;fresh&quot; fish in your freezer and available at a moment's notice. 
In these photos, the frozen fillets were thawed in 15 minutes in a cool salt 
bath, towel-dried and produced the fillets on the right. I use about 1/3 cup 
coarse sea salt to 1.5 qt/L. of cold water, stirred vigorously to dissolve the 
salt. Frozen fillets are added to the water and left for 15-20 minutes, 
depending on the thickness of the fish. The trick is not to leave the fillets 
in longer than this or they can become water-logged. Pat dry the fish, and use 
immediately.<br>
<br>
<br>
CORIANDER-MUSTARD OPAKAPAKA<br>
2 fillets opakapaka, 
or other snapper, fillets (with skin on)<br>
1 tsp. ground coriander seeds<br>

1/2 tsp. ground cumin<br>
1/2 tsp. ground yellow mustard powder (e.g., 
Coleman's)<br>
4 tsp. fresh lime or lemon juice<br>
fine sea salt<br>
oil for 
cooking<br>
<br>
Combine coriander and mustard powders. Sprinkle spices onto 
skinless side of fish, and gently massage. Drizzle 2 tsp. of lemon juice on 
each fillet. Set aside for 15 minutes.<br>
<br>
Pre-heat skillet large enough 
to hold both fillets over medium-high heat. Add oil to skillet. Season fillets 
with sea salt, and place skinless side down on skillet. Cook for 1 minute and 
turn heat down to medium. Cook another 2-3 minutes, or until browned crust 
forms and releases from pan. Turn fish over and cook another 2-3 minutes, 
depending on thickness of fish. It will flake easily when cooked.<br>
<br>
To 
assemble, mound cabbage onto plate and place fish on top. Serve with rice or 
mashed potatoes.<br>

<h1>Acupuncture, Part I: An Overview</h1>  May12 2008 I know I&rsquo;ve talked 
about this series on acupuncture with several readers and friends. It was first 
postponed because we went off-line for one week, and now is further delayed 
because last week I remembered to bring the medical releases to the clinic, 
but...forgot the camera. *smacking forehead* My next opportunity to take photos 
of the test subject is next week. <em>Yes, I should ask the acupuncturist 
whether forgetfulness can be treated with needles, too</em> .<br>
<br>
So 
begging your indulgence for this dense post, I&rsquo;m going to go ahead with a 
quick overview of acupuncture. The next post will cover the clinic experience 
&mdash; what to expect and what it feels like. A third post will look at the 
homework you can anticipate when you&rsquo;re back from the clinic (yes, 
there&rsquo;s homework). <br>

<p><br>
<br>
</p> 
<h3>CHI </h3> 
<p></p> 
<p>When you think of acupuncture, you probably think of needles. Lots of them. 
And while this is certainly a defining aspect of acupuncture &mdash; versus 
say, acupressure or massage &mdash; it really isn&rsquo;t the heart of it. 
Instead, to understand how acupuncture works, we have to re-visit the concept 
of Chi (<em>chee</em>), also spelled Qi, or Ki (<em>kee</em>) in Japanese (as 
in Rei-ki).<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Chi&rdquo; is probably one of the most difficult 
concepts for the Western mind to wrap itself around. It is defined here by a 
physician trained in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), identified only as Dr. 
Fang, in Dr. David Eisenberg&rsquo;s (MD) seminal book on TCM,<em>Encounters 
with Qi (W.W. Norton &amp; Co., 1985)</em>:<br>
</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p> &lsquo;Qi means that which differentiates life from death, animate from 
inanimate. To live is to have Qi in every part of your body. To die is to be a 
body without Qi. For health to be maintained, there must be a balance of Qi, 
neither too much nor too little.&rsquo; (page 43)</p> </blockquote> <br>
In 
English, it is most often translated as &quot;universal life force,&quot; or 
&quot;vital essence.&quot; TCM understands Chi as existing not only within the 
body, but also in the environment &mdash; we take in nutritional Chi by the 
foods we eat, and breathe in air Chi by respiration.<br>
<br>
TCM envisions the 
body&rsquo;s Chi as existing in and running through channels, or meridians, 
that are interconnected and that affect each other in different relationships. 
Each meridian is linked to a major organ in the body, and is often named after 
the organ with which it is associated (e.g., the Lung Meridian). Through the 
meridians, Chi circulates through the healthy body in a defined pattern, 
delivering needed nutrition to organs and removing wastes and toxins. When 
there is an imbalance in one meridian, it can cause a domino effect in the 
other meridians, both behind and forward of the unbalanced or blocked channel. 
If left untreated, the body&rsquo;s Chi becomes weak and leaves the body 
susceptible to both internal and external factors that can precipitate disease 
and illness.<br>
<br>
It is the role of the TCM physician not to diagnosis the 
disease or condition (pneumonia, migraine, back pain, etc.), but rather the 
underlying root of the imbalance in the body&rsquo;s Chi. The condition is 
merely a symptom of a deeper issue &mdash; the physician is interested in <em>
Why</em>  the pneumonia, migraine, etc., has been able to overcome the 
body&rsquo;s protective Chi. In every case the answer will be different because 
each patient will have different circumstances that bring on their health 
crisis. Therefore, two people who enter a TCM physician&rsquo;s office with the 
same complaint (e.g., migraines) are likely to have completely different 
treatment regimes.<br>
<br>
For we who are accustomed to the treatment model, 
&ldquo;You have this condition, take this pill&rdquo; this takes a moment to 
sink in. It is the meaning of &ldquo;Holistic&rdquo; &mdash; that individuals 
require treatments tailored for their individual circumstance. Wow, what a 
concept. And that is the feel-good side of holistic practices: you&rsquo;re not 
just a condition, you&rsquo;re an individual. The flip-side of holistic 
practices (acupuncture included) is that these treatments are not magic 
bullets, and they often don&rsquo;t provide immediate relief of the symptoms 
that bring us to the TCM physician&rsquo;s clinic. Sometimes symptoms will even 
get worse for awhile, before they get better.<br>
<br>
The thing to keep in 
mind is this: the series of circumstances that finally brings on physical 
symptoms in the form of disease or illness are often the result of years, even 
decades, of accumulated poor practices (lousy diet, poor sleep habits, lack of 
exercise) and environmental influences (stress, weather, trauma). It 
won&rsquo;t be undone in a day, a week, or even a month. As for worsening 
symptoms, this is also something recognized in Western medicine. My father 
suffers with large tophi (uric acid crystallizations) that leave his hands and 
knees deformed and painful. His internist warned him that the low-purine diet 
he was prescribed should slowly dissolve the acid crystals, but that as the 
crystals dissolved they would re-enter the blood stream before being eliminated 
through the kidneys. The sudden influx of uric acid in the blood could trigger 
a painful gout attack, in which case his medication dosages would be adjusted. 
Eventually the tophi should be eliminated; and if he maintains a sensible diet, 
the gout attacks also minimized.<br>
<br>

<h3>DIAGNOSIS </h3> In TCM, diagnoses are made in terms of Chi: Is there 
enough Chi? Is it active (Yang) or stagnant (Yin)? What channels/meridians are 
affected? What internal and external factors are affecting the meridians?<br>

<br>To reach a diagnosis, the physician will use carefully defined techniques, 
some of which have been chronicled, practiced, and adapted for 2000 years. 
These include pulse-taking, examining the tongue, specific questioning, and 
observation of the patient's speech, smell, color and appearance. We will touch 
on those more in the next part in the series, The Clinic Visit .<br>
<br>

<h3>ACUPUNCTURE </h3> So how does acupuncture work? The theory behind TCM is 
simple enough: restore balance to the body&rsquo;s Chi and the body can begin 
to heal itself. A primary use for acupuncture is the stimulation of points 
along affected meridians to allow Chi to travel as it should on its appointed 
route.<br>
<br>
TCM teaches that there are 12 meridian pairs running 
symmetrically along the left and right sides of the body, 2 non-paired 
meridians that run along the midline of the torso and head, and collateral 
meridians which are points that connect meridians to one another. Each meridian 
has a defined number of points; some have as few 9, others over 60; for a total 
of over 300 points.<br>
<br>
In acupuncture, meridian points are influenced 
with the insertion of long, thin needles, which may also be used to conduct a 
mild electric current. The needles can release accumulated Chi in a blocked 
meridian (in much the same way accumulated water is released when a pipe is 
cleaned), or stimulate slow-moving or stagnant Chi to circulate more freely 
(imagine fresh water coming in to a tidepool), or divert Chi from one meridian 
to another. In each case, the goal is to restore the open circulation of Chi.
<br><br>
Another use for acupuncture is pain management and anesthesia. Even 
non-TCM physicians can use acupuncture to manage pain in chronic illnesses such 
as fibromyalgia or diabetes. In these cases, needles are inserted at meridian 
points which are thought to release endorphins into the body to lessen pain. 
This can be used in conjunction with meridian points that also support body 
functions that contribute to the patient&rsquo;s comfort and well-being in 
managing his overall condition (e.g., blood cell production, elimination of 
toxins by the liver and kidneys, etc.). Acupuncture has also been used in lieu 
of or with local anesthetics to control pain during surgery or painful 
treatments.<br>
<br>

<h3>FURTHER READING </h3> This is a bare-bones description of acupuncture. 
I've purposefully left out naming meridians, and descriptions of how they 
influence each other because: one, it gets confusing and I am not the authority 
to explain it; and two, it isn't necessary to know in order to seek treatment. 
One can get a consultation and treatment from a TCM physician without knowing a 
thing about anything written here.<br>
<br>
Although we were familiar with the 
concept of Chi in our practice with Reiki, when we started acupuncture this 
year most concepts were in the category: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard of that, not 
exactly sure what it means.&rdquo; T is happy with the results he feels and 
sees with his treatments, and leaves well enough alone. That&rsquo;s great, but 
if you&rsquo;re like me and would like to read more about acupuncture, I 
recommend Dr. Ruth Kidson&rsquo;s book, <em>Acupuncture for Everyone: What It 
Is, Why It Works, and How It Can Help You (Healing Arts Press, 2000)</em> . Dr. 
Kidson is a licensed physician in the U.K., and I found her book immensely 
helpful in getting a grasp of the fundamentals of acupuncture. Her writing is 
clear, straightforward, and easy for a lay person to follow. I was already on 
my third treatment before I got to the heart of her book, where she discusses 
the symptomology associated with imbalances in different meridians, and I was 
fascinated with how the descriptions in her book matched my own doctor's 
diagnosis and treatment. I found this book at the public library, but it's soon 
going to become a part of our home library.<br>
<br>
The book quoted from at 
the top is an exploration of the phenomenon of Chi, or Qi, by medical doctor 
and researcher, Dr. David Eisenberg. Dr. Eisenberg was one of the first 
U.S.-trained doctors to study and train in TCM in Beijing in the late 1970s. 
Fluent in Mandarin, and a graduate of Harvard Medical School, Dr. Eisenberg 
brought an empiricist&rsquo;s eye to his studies in Beijing. His quest to 
quantify the results he saw in his practice there is enlightening whether you 
would want to prove or disprove his findings. Most of the book is anecdotal 
&mdash; accounts of his experiences learning acupuncture, herbology, and 
massage at one of the top TCM universities in Beijing. Since writing this book 
in the mid-1980s, Dr. Eisenberg has gone on to found a research center at his 
alma mater to further the empirical study of TCM and other alternative, 
complementary &mdash; the Center calls them &ldquo;integrative&rdquo; &mdash; 
therapies. Read more about the Harvard Medical School Osher Research Center and 
its current research agenda . <br>
<br>

<h3>FINDING A PRACTITIONER </h3> Finally, if you're considering acupuncture 
for yourself, Dr. Kidson offers some practical advice about choosing a 
practitioner and what to expect. First, she cautions that most governing bodies 
of complementary medicine do not allow their registered members to advertise 
(Yellow pages listing or &quot;Accepting new patients&quot; notices in 
newspapers are allowed), so be wary of flyers that promote acupuncture for 
specific illnesses; in fact, your best bet may be to seek personal 
recommendations. Second, consider whether you are interested in pain management 
only or a more holistic approach, then check whether the acupuncturist you are 
interested in has earned a degree (a longer more comprehensive program with an 
holistic approach) or taken course work in treating symptomatic pain. During 
your first appointment, describe your condition and ask whether the 
practitioner can treat it, what the limitations of treatment are, and how long 
you might expect treatment to continue; the practitioner should be willing to 
recommend other treatment options if you don't show improvement over time. To 
these I would add, familiarize yourself with the licensing requirements in your 
jurisdiction; every country &mdash; and in the U.S., every state &mdash; has 
different requirements and allows different titles to be used. You can read 
Hawaii's regulations regarding acupuncture in full: H.R.S. &sect;436E: 
Acupuncture Practice  (I could no longer find these readable on-line, this link 
will download a PDF file to your computer). <br>
<br>
I didn't pick up Dr. 
Kidson's book until after my second treatment, so it was sheer good fortune 
that we found the TCM practitioner we did. Although she limits her practice in 
Hawaii to acupuncture and herbology, she also trained as a medical doctor 
specializing in acupuncture in her home country. Her training allows us to talk 
to her about our medical conditions, and she has advised us when to seek 
further Western medical diagnoses too. In the next part of this series , you'll 
meet the charming Dr. Wong, D.Ac., in her clinic.<br>

<h1>No Bacon Butty? Try a Ham on Poi Muffin</h1>  May08 2008 <br>
Over at the 
Golden Arches, there are often featured items that cater to local tastes, like 
the occasional Taro or Haupia Pies in Hawaii. If I were the man with the curly 
red wig, this is what I would have on the breakfast menu over there. A 
breakfast sandwich with char-siu ham, furikake-dressed egg cooked medium-soft 
in a butter-kissed poi english muffin. No need cheese, it's too tasty already.
<br> <br>
This is going out to Sandy in San Antonio, who asked in December what 
a Bacon Butty was (at first we thought it was &quot;bacon buddy&quot; &mdash; 
it was referenced on a British sitcom). I've had no luck finding any back bacon 
on Oahu, and regular or Canadian bacon really isn't the same. With Hawaii's 
historical ties to England, you'd think you could find more British products 
around here (bangers, yes; back bacon, no). I know my little creation bears 
absolutely no resemblance to a Bacon Butty, but hey, it hits the spot for 
grease and whimsy. Have you had better luck making a Bacon Butty? (Read a BBC 
report on thescientific method to the perfect bacon butty) <br>

<h1>Crispy Nori-Wrapped Walu &amp; Shrimp with Papaya Coulis</h1>  May05 2008 
<br> <br>
The three times we've gone out to dinner for our anniversary here in 
Hawaii have all been disappointments. So this year I decided to make something 
at home instead. Armed with a new cookbook from local chef Elmer Guzman 
(recommended by Laurie in Alaska!), I borrowed ideas from 2-3 different dishes 
to create this: a nori-wrapped walu and shrimp lumpia and a citrusy papaya 
coulis.<br>
<br>
Walu is sold here as &quot;Hawaiian butterfish&quot; but is 
properly known as Escolar &mdash; a very white, flaky and oily fish that is 
actually banned in Japan and Italy because it can cause intestinal upset if not 
prepared properly (grill or pan-fry to release the oils that cause upset) or if 
consumed in too great a quantity (no more than 6 oz. per person). But I'm not 
scared! I love the unusual firm but most texture and mid flavor, and especially 
enjoyed this preparation. However, any firm flaky fish, such as tilapia, cod, 
halibut, snapper or even catfish would do well as a substitute here.<br>
<br>
I 
love the flavor of nori in this, and I think it makes for a nice presentation, 
but if it would dissuade you from trying this, then feel free to leave it out. 
For the coulis, I paired the papaya with lime juice &mdash; a winning local 
flavor combination &mdash; and added a splash of wine vinegar for acidity to 
cut through the oiliness of both the walu itself, and the deep-fired shell. If 
you can find nigella, also called onion seeds, at a health food store (in the 
bulk spice section) or an Indian grocer, the peppery black seeds make a 
wonderful counterpoint to the flavors in the coulis and fish; otherwise, black 
sesame seeds or even crushed papaya seeds can be used for presentation.<br>
<br>
It was a great marriage of contrasts and balance &mdash; crispy yet meltingly 
soft fish, and sweet but tart fruit sauce.<br>
Kind of like a couple I know. . .
<br> <br>
CRISPY NORI-WRAPPED WALU &amp; SHRIMP W/PAPAYA COULIS <br>
(inspired 
by<em>The Shoreline Chef</em>, by Elmer Guzman) <br>
For the Papaya Coulis: <br>
1 ripe papaya, peeled, halved and seeded<br>
sea salt <br>
1/2 tsp. raw sugar 
<br>2 tsp. white wine vinegar, or 3 tsp. rice wine vinegar <br>
2 tsp. fresh 
lime juice<br>
<br>
Place all ingredients except lime juice in a small 
saucepan. Using a hand or stick blender, puree papaya until smooth. Cook over 
medium heat until it just starts to bubble, about 10 minutes. Then reduce heat 
to low and simmer an additional 5 minutes. Remove from heat and add lime juice. 
Taste and correct seasoning &mdash; you shouldn't &quot;taste&quot; vinegar or 
salt at all, only the papaya and lime.<br>
<br>
<br>
For the Shrimp Filling: 
<br>6 oz. shrimp, peeled and coarsely diced <br>
1 large piece of dried Chinese 
black fungus (tree ear, or mok yee), rehydrated and cut in slivers<br>
sea salt 
<br>ground white pepper <br>
2 tsp. sake or Chinese rice wine <br>
1 stalk of 
Chinese flowering chives, or flat garlic chives<br>
1/2 tsp. corn starch <br>

<br>Combine all ingredients, and leave to marinate at least 20 minutes, but no 
longer than 2 hours in fridge.<br>
<br>
3-4oz. of walu, tilapia, cod, halibut 
or other firm flaky fish, filet cut into 4 equal pieces<br>
(This step is only 
necessary if you are using Walu. For other types of fish, I would skip this.) 
Pan-fry each filet piece in a lightly oiled skillet over medium-high heat. 
Brown all sides. Lay on paper towels to cool completely.<br>
<br>
To assemble: 
<br>4 sheets of lumpia or egg-roll wrappers (covered with a lightly dampened 
cloth while working)<br>
2 sheets of nori for sushi, each cut in half <br>

water, to seal rolls<br>
<br>
To Finish: <br>
Nigella, or onion seeds <br>

Flowering chives<br>
<br>
Preheat oil in wok or other deep-fryer to 375F. <br>

Lay lumpia wrapper on clean dry surface. Place nori in center of wrapper (you 
may have to trim nori so it doesn't cover the top end of the wrapper, or you 
won't be able to seal it).<br>
Place fish on nori near the bottom edge, and a 
few spoonfuls of shrimp on fish (see photo at left).<br>
Bring bottom end to 
cover fish/shrimp, then fold sides to center around filling (middle photo).<br>

Keeping gentle pressure on the filling as you roll (to keep it tight), roll to 
the top. Wet top edge of wrapper with water (photo at right), before last roll 
to seal.<br>
Repeat 3 more times. <br>
<br>
Fry 2 at time so they don't crowd 
the wok. Cook for about 5 minutes total, turning lumpia over after 3 minutes. 
Remove to paper towels to drain. Repeat with remaining lumpia. If using 
flowering chives, make certain they are completely dry (or it will splatter and 
you will burn yourself), and hold one end of chives and briefly dip flowering 
end into hot oil. Drain.<br>
<br>
To serve, slice each roll in half on a sharp 
diagonal. I originally wanted to serve this on a bed of chewy soba noodles, but 
in the end I was really craving rice so that's what we had this time. Buckwheat 
soba noodles would also go well with both the fish and the coulis. Place fish 
on and around rice or noodles, drizzle coulis around edge of plate and sprinkle 
with nigella. Garnish with chives.<br>

<h1>Pears, Blue Cheese &amp; Walnuts w/Baby Greens</h1>  May04 2008 
<p><br>
</p> 
<p>We don't have green salads very often, but our hands-down favorite is this 
pear, blue cheese &amp; toasted walnuts on a bed of baby greens. Now pears, 
nuts and cheeses can also serve as a or pre-dessert or dessert course, and I 
actually prefer this salad after the entree. The acriditiy in the walnuts and 
mustardy, nutty vinaigrette is the perfect foil for the play between the sweet 
pears and salty, musky cheese. This is another one of those dishes where the 
synergy in the whole surpasses the sum of the individual parts.<br>
<br>
 Of 
course, the star here is the blue cheese so use the best quality you can find, 
Maytag and Amish blues are our favorites in the US; Roquefort (Papillon brand, 
if available) in the Continent. The pears, too are important; search out ones 
with a creamy texture when ripe such as Bartletts/Williams or Packhams. 
Oriental/nashi pears are delicious, but the synergy is not present when we 
tried this combination. And don't forget the walnuts. I don't like walnuts 
&mdash; in any recipe where I can substitute another nut or omit them 
completely, I will do it in a New Your minute! But there's something about the 
tannins in the skins and the slightly sweet taste brought on by the toasting 
that makes the walnuts a crucial part of the synergy. The salad seems 
&quot;flat&quot; without them &mdash; see, we did try to leave them out once!
<br><br>
PEAR, BLUE CHEESE &amp; WALNUTS WITH BABY GREENS AND HAZELNUT 
VINAIGRETTE<br>
For 2 people<br>
Place salad plates in refrigerator to chill 
for at least an hour.<br>
<br>
1/2 cup walnuts<br>
Preheat small counter top 
oven to 400F/200C. Position oven rack to the highest tier. Chop nuts coarsely 
and place them on a tray. When oven is fully pre-heated, place nuts in top rack 
and roast for one minute, then turn off heat and lave oven door closed until 
pan completely cools. Meanwhile, prepare vinaigrette and salad.<br>
<br>
For 
the Hazelnut Vinaigrette:<br>
1 tsp. Dijon-style mustard<br>
1/4 tsp. sea salt
<br>fresh ground black pepper<br>
1/8 tsp. raw sugar<br>
1 tsp. lemon juice<br>

2 tsp. white or red wine vinegar<br>
1/4 cup hazelnut oil (or walnut oil)<br>

<br>In a small bowl, put mustard, salt, pepper, sugar and lemon juice and whisk 
well to dissolve salt and sugar. Add vinegar and whisk again until 
incorporated. Add all of the oil, and whisk vigorously to emulsify. Set aside.
<br><br>
2 firm-ripe Bartlett, or other creamy type, pears<br>
4 cups of baby 
greens, or mache<br>
2 oz. chunk of Maytag or other quality blue cheese<br>
<br>
Peel pears, then quarter lengthwise and remove core. Slice each quarter 
lengthwise into 3-4 pieces.<br>
Place 2 cups of greens on each chilled plate. 
and lay 2 quarters (1/2 pear) over greens.<br>
With a fork, separate small 
chunks of cheese and scatter over salad. Add cooled walnuts.<br>
Drizzle 
Vinaigrette over all and serve immediately with or without sliced baguettes on 
the side.<br>

<h1>Stuffed Chicken Roll-up</h1>  May03 2008 <br>
We actually dined on this in 
March, shortly after my dad returned to Guam and we found we still had ground 
chicken in the freezer. We don't usually buy ground chicken, but it was the 
best meat alternative for his gout maintenance diet. I wanted to make something 
a little different than the meatloaf or meatball alternatives running through 
my head. We also had some beautiful asparagus and a large quantity ofcaponata 
newly made. Instead of adding it all into a loaf, what if we rolled it into the 
center of a meat casing. How would they go together?<br>
<br>
Pretty well, 
actually. Although the roll did not hold its shape as well as it might have 
with ground beef or pork, the flavors melded well. The lightly seasoned chicken 
and fresh asparagus absorbed the salty play of flavors in the eggplant relish. 
Served over a bed of polenta-style grits with oyster mushrooms, it was a 
colorful and satisfying meal. I used a lot more caponata than I would have 
liked (less for me to snack on), but I didn't begrudge the loss of my favorite 
appetizer (too much).<br>
<br>
<br>
STUFFED CHICKEN ROLL-UP WITH ASPARAGUS 
&amp; CAPONATA<br>
For the ground meat mixture: <br>
1.5 lb ground chicken (or 
beef, pork)<br>
sea salt to taste <br>
ground black pepper <br>
1/2 medium 
onion, diced fine<br>
1 medium egg (optional -- if I made this with ground 
chicken again, I would omit the egg so the roll might keep its shape better)<br>
<br>Combine all ingredients well. Chill until needed. <br>
<br>
To Finish: <br>

4-6 spears of asparagus (depending on width of spears)<br>
1-1/2 cups prepared 
Caponata (recipe) <br>
<br>
On a piece of wax paper or plastic wrap (about 
16&quot; long), form meat mixture into a rectangle, about 12&quot; long and 
6&quot; wide.<br>
<br>
Add layer of caponata to within 1/2-inch of the long 
side closest to you and 2&quot; from the far end. Lay asparagus spears 
side-by-side over caponata.<br>
<br>
Using the paper/plastic wrap as a guide, 
begin to roll the meat over the filling, jelly roll or sushi style. When 
completely enclosed, twist ends of plastic/wax closed and tuck under. Place 
roll on cookie sheet and leave in refrigerator for at least 30 minutes. 
Meanwhile, pre-heat the oven to 400F/200C.<br>
<br>
Lightly oil a baking sheet, 
and place chilled meat roll on sheet. Drizzle olive oil over loaf, if using 
chicken. Bake for 20 minutes, then turn heat down to 350F/180C and continue 
baking for 20 more minutes. Allow to cool on the sheet for 15 minutes. Using a 
wide fish slice/spatula, remove roll to cutting board and slice on the diagonal.
<br> <br>
Serve with mashed potatoes, polenta or pasta.

<h1>Passing the torch</h1>  May03 2008 
<p><br>
<br>
</p> 
<p>Well, we&rsquo;ve enjoyed having the &ldquo;E for Excellent&rdquo; badge 
all to ourselves for 2 weeks, and now it&rsquo;s time to pass it on. Nicisme, 
baking, clicking and blogging in the UK viaCherrapeno awarded ThreeTastes with 
this badge. And now we&rsquo;d like to award it to five sites that define 
Excellence for us:<br>
<br>
1. The Tasty Island: Pomai is for me the arbiter of 
Hawaiian culinaria. He not only covers the best and the tastiest of restaurants 
and drive-inns, but also explores the minutiae of Hawaiian classics: ramens vs. 
saimins, Spam and its look-alikes, loco-mocos, you name it. I read and often 
think, &quot;I did NOT know that!&quot; and then have to fix myself some kind 
of snack. Also check out his great how-to guides on local favorites like kalua 
pork, ashtibitchi, and Portuguese bean soup, to name a few.<br>
<br>
2. Rubber 
Slippers in Italy: Kauai-expat Rowena lives, eats, gardens and travels in and 
around the Lecco province of northern Italy, near Milan, with her Westie, 
Maddie, and husband, MotH, and shares her adventures with us with wit, whimsy, 
and often thought-provoking comment. She's a local girl living my dream life in 
Italia: searching out festas and sagras, local delicacies, and allowing us a 
peek behind the curtain at the marvel that is Italy. *sigh*<br>
<br>
3. 
Mediterranean Cooking in Alaska: when you first read the title of this weblog, 
it&rsquo;s understandable if you do a double-take. Mediterranean cooking. In 
Alaska?? But Laurie will make a believer out of you. A &ldquo;recovering 
attorney&rdquo; (I can say this, as someone with the same affliction) and 
part-time resident of Greece, Laurie&rsquo;s attention to detail and sprinkling 
of helpful tips belie her former profession and her love for her topic. On her 
site, also check out her book, &ldquo;Tastes Like Home,&rdquo; a collection of 
recipes from members of her Greek Orthodox church &mdash; the proceeds of the 
book go directly to building their new church.<br>
<br>
4. Lavaterra: lavaterra 
pens her eponymous weblog from her corner of Munich to share her inventive 
baking, cooking, and Wandern (hiking) in and around her hometown. I love her 
posts because she shows such fearlessness when it comes to trying new foods, 
techniques, and spices. She writes mostly in German, and hers is one of several 
German sites I visit to keep my reading skills semi-current. Thankfully, she 
accepts comments in English since she is a Canada-phile and fluent in English.
<br><br>
5. Obachan&rsquo;s Kitchen &amp; Balcony Garden: Obachan is the 
Japanese familiar, &ldquo;Auntie,&rdquo; and also the pen-name for this wry and 
insightful Japanese gourmand living in the rural village of Kochi, Japan. 
Obachan shares her kitchen experiments and glimpses of life in her community in 
sometimes poetic, always delicious prose. Reading her posts, I always marvel to 
think that she is writing in a second language (English)!<br>

<h1>Preserving the Perfume of Lemons</h1>  May02 2008 <br>
<br>
So how do we 
take beautiful but tough-skinned lemons like these and turn them into the 
succulent, translucent beauties known as Preserved Lemons? All you need are 1-2 
sterilized jars and lids, 10 lemons, one cup of coarse sea salt, and after 5 
days, some olive oil. Plus 4-6 weeks of patience.<br>
<br>
Our efforts, 
however, will be rewarded with nothing short of liquid gold. Yes, you can use 
the rinds in tagines like Chicken with Preserved Lemons &amp; Olives , but the 
briny lemony curing liquid is also a quick flavor boost for dressings, 
marinades, and drinks; and even the oil sealing in the lemons can add a touch 
of clean citrus flavor when used to pan-fry meats or fish, or saute vegetables.
<br><br>
The end result will look like the next 2 photos. Admittedly, not 
pretty perhaps. But here is a jar filled with a perfumed elixir redolent of 
sunshine and citrus, ready to bring the light and lightness of summer to any 
dish, savory or sweet. In the depths of winter, it's a real joy to have one of 
these jars gleaming at the back of the fridge, promising that summer will 
return, and boosting our spirits until it does. (I did have 8 winters in 
Germany and Boston before we moved to Hawaii . . . I remember the feeling!)<br>

<br> 
<h3>The Jars </h3>  You can use a single 1 quart/liter jar for 6 lemons, or 2 
half-liters with 3 lemons each. The advantage of using 2 jars is two-fold. I 
find they're easier to store in the fridge; and opening the second jar for the 
first time in the middle of winter is a special kind of present for the chef. 
(In the photos below you see one half-liter bottle with 3 lemons.) Sterilize 
your jars and lids as you would for canning.<br>
<br>

<h3>The Lemons</h3>  If you have access to particularly flavorful lemon 
varieties such as Meyers or Sorrentos, by all means use those, but regular 
lemons will work just as well (I've only ever used regular lemons, but will 
cheerfully accept donations of Meyers or Sorrentos if someone wants me to 
experiment with those!). If you can find organic ones, even better. No matter 
what variety, look for lemons that are unblemished and with a firm skin.<br>

<br>Wash the lemons well. I used to lightly scrub the surface with a soft 
vegetable brush (not a potato brush, the bristles are too hard and will release 
the precious lemon oils into the wash water). A couple of years ago, however, I 
started looking for alternatives to remove pesticides and dirt from all produce 
and found many sites recommending soaking or washing with white vinegar, so we 
adopted this method with great success. Then last fall, National Public Radio 
ran a story ( &quot; What does it take to clean fresh food ,&quot;) about the 
importance of removing pesticides and dirt from all produce before using, and 
recommended using white vinegar. The magazine <em>Cook's Illustrated</em>  has 
also tested white vinegar against a commercial vegetable cleaner for 2 
purposes: 1) removing wax  from vegetables (they tested cucumbers, but apples, 
lemons and other citrus are also waxed, see April 2007 edition), and 2) killing 
bacteria  (March 2007). In both cases, they recommended plain white vinegar 
over the purchased product. ( <em>The NPR story link is accessible to anyone, 
but the CI articles are available to members only on the Web, but check your 
library for back issues</em> .)<br>
<br>
<br>
Now I soak the lemons in a 
solution of 1/4 cup white vinegar and 1/2 gallon of water for about a minute, 
then rinse in cool water. Dry each lemon with a clean paper towel. (If you 
lightly rub the surface of a lemon with your thumb before and after this brief 
soak, you will appreciate just how much wax, if nothing else, is removed by 
this simple step.) And since the prized part of preserving lemons is the rind, 
it's really a step worth doing.<br>
<br>
Cut 6 of the lemons into 6-8 pieces, 
depending on the size of each. Remove straggler seeds that can be reached 
without having to dig too hard into each piece. Cut remaining 4 lemons in half 
crosswise and juice well with a lemon reamer or juicer. Keep juice aside. (If 
you're feeling really motivated, zest the lemons before cutting in half, and 
keep zest either in the freezer for future use; or add to 4 cups of sugar in an 
air-tight container and keep for 2 weeks, after which you will have a wonderful 
lemon sugar to use in baking or iced tea.)<br>
<br>

<h3>The Salt</h3>  I prefer coarse sea salt, but kosher salt will work too 
&mdash; what you're looking for is a salt that is minimally processed, and is 
not Iodized.  Iodized salt will cloud and add a strange off-taste to your 
finished product. Measure out about a cup of salt for every 6 lemons you intend 
to preserve. Put 2 tablespoons or so of salt into the bottom of your sterilized 
jar, and place first layer of lemon pieces atop salt. Cover with 2-3 more 
spoonfuls of salt, then next layer of lemons. Continue layering salt and 
lemons, ending with salt. If you're doing 2 separate half-liter jars, you will 
probably need 1-2 more tablespoons of salt for each jar.<br>
<br>
Using a 
sterilized spoon, press on the lemons to pack them well, then add reserved 
lemon juice. Cover and leave in a warm dark place.<br>
<br>
Day Two. The lemons 
will begin to soften, use a sterilized spoon to press them below the juice line 
as much as possible, and shake gently to re-distribute the salt.<br>
<br>
Day 
Three - Five. Repeat process of pressing down lemons and shaking bottle.<br>

<br>On Day Five, after pressing lemons, gently tap bottom of the jar against 
the counter several times to ensure all air bubbles have been released. Top 
mixture with olive oil to seal: place the back (rounded side) of a spoon about 
and inch above the juice line, and touching the inside of the jar, and slowly 
pour oil over the spoon &mdash; this will allow the oil to just sit over the 
juice and lemons with splattering. Add about an inch of oil. Cover and place in 
a dark cool corner of the pantry.<br>
<br>
And now we wait. Today is the end of 
the Week One. Only 3-5 more weeks to go. The end time is determined by the 
weather, the types of lemons, quantity being preserved, etc. The rinds on these 
particular lemons looked a bit thick, so I'm guessing these will take another 4 
weeks (for a total of 5) before they're done. If you find a thinner-rinded 
lemon, like the Meyers, yours might be ready in 4 weeks total. You can follow 
the transformation of this batch at the Lemon Vigil , which will be in the 
sidebar for the next 2 months. I'll put up a photo each Friday with notes about 
any special care the lemons needed. When the lemons are ready, we'll have more 
recipes to try, too.<br>

<h1>Chicken with Preserved Lemons &amp; Olives</h1>  May01 2008 <br>
<br>
This 
may look like a simple bottle of salt covered lemons, but in fact it's a 
statement &mdash; an acceptance of the fact that we won't be moving as soon as 
we had thought we would. Why? Because these preserved lemons won't be ready for 
another 4 to 6 weeks, so . . . here we will be for the near future. So while I 
will continue to use up most of our pantry stock, I will also have to re-stock 
some of our most frequently used and beloved items, such as preserved lemons.
<br><br>
But what is a preserved lemon and why would anyone want them in their 
pantry? Because they are one of the most concentrated and divine lemon-delivery 
systems yet devised. And one of the easiest to make at home. All you need are 
lemons, salt, a bit of olive oil (to seal the jar), and time. There are 
different types of preserved lemons, some cured only in salt (no juice), others 
which are spiced with cinnamon and other flavors. Our favorite style is 
preserved in salt and lemon juice only. Our first taste of this exotica was a 
jar of juice-and-salt preserved lemons purchased 10 years ago in a Turkish dry 
goods shop in Germany. It was such a revelation and so versatile an ingredient, 
our pantry has been stocked with it ever since (between moves anyway). But that 
first jar was also our last purchased jar, because once I learned how easy they 
were to make it seemed a shame to to buy them. But before we go through the 
making of the lemons , let's talk about one of the most popular uses for them. 
<br><br>
These 2 photos were taken last year, though I used the last of that 
jar earlier this year to make our favorite Chicken with Preserved Lemons and 
Olives. You will find many versions of this dish all over the Internet, and 
with good reason. It's easy on the cook, slightly exotic but with familiar 
flavors, and elegant enough to serve to company. In fact, if you find yourself 
entertaining a mixed group of palates &mdash; some willing to try the exotic, 
some more sedate &mdash; this dish will often satisfy both. (Sometimes I leave 
out the word &quot;Preserved&quot; when offering this to some of the shy-er 
palates because they can find the descriptive off-putting, although they are 
also usually the ones most taken with the intense lemon flavor.)<br>
<br>
<br>

Once cured, the lemon becomes nearly translucent ( <em>photo at righ</em> t) 
and very soft. Cookbooks and recipes will usually advise you to separate the 
rind from the pulp, and discard the pulp. If I were using the lemons for a cake 
or a drink, I would use only the rind; but for this casserole style dish, I do 
include the separated pulp in the cooking medium for the added flavor, but it 
is not eaten.<br>
<br>
We've tried different variations of this Middle Eastern 
classic, and this recipe is devised from many of those so I'm not sure I can 
say it is Turkish or Middle Eastern. I can tell you it's delicious, and is our 
current favorite recipe though we're still open to taste-testing other 
versions. Even keeping the spice combination the same, the most striking flavor 
difference can be wrought by changing the type of olives used. You can 
certainly mix green and black varieties, or go with your favorite one. The 
absolute best version we've made with this particular recipe used grande 
Spanish green olives (with pits), so if you have those around, do try them 
here. We prefer to keep the pits in almost all our cooking with olives, even 
pizza, but you can pit your olives before adding them to the dish. If you opt 
to leave the pits in, be sure to tell your guests to prevent a cracked tooth!
<br><br>
We used the last of our stash to make this chicken dish for my dad 
when he was visiting earlier this year. With all the lemons and spices, I 
thought it would be okay for him on his low-purine diet (without the chicken 
skin, of course). He really liked it, so I'm including it in the GDC round-up  
in case he's moved to try it at home sometime.<br>
<br>
Make a hole through the 
olive oil seal to remove your lemon quarters, and reseal with additional oil if 
necessary. I've found the lemons will keep for up to a year in the fridge this 
way.<br>
<br>
<br>
CHICKEN WITH PRESERVED LEMONS &amp; OLIVES<br>
<em>Please 
note that there is no salt specified in this recipe. That is because we use 
both the pulp and juice from the preserved lemons, which contain a lot of salt.
</em> <br>
<br>
1 3-4 lb. (1.5-2kg) chicken, cut into serving size, or an equal 
weight of chicken thighs<br>
1 tsp. cumin<br>
1/2 tsp. coriander<br>
1/2 tsp. 
sweet paprika<br>
1/2 tsp. freshly ground black pepper<br>
<br>
Combine cumin, 
coriander, paprika and pepper. Rub spice mixture into chicken, especially under 
the skin and between the bone and breast meat, if using whole chicken. Set 
aside for at least 30 minutes, but as long as overnight in the fridge.<br>
<br>

1 whole preserved lemon ( method here )<br>
<br>
Separate pulp and rinds. Cut 
rinds into thin slices, and place 3/4 of slices under the skin and between 
flesh of chicken. Pre-heat oven to 350F/180C.<br>
<br>
2 TBL. olive oil<br>
1 
medium onion, sliced thinly lengthwise<br>
3 cloves garlic, coarsely chopped<br>
3-4 bay leaves<br>
1 - 1 and 1/2 cup whole olives, unpitted (depends on type of 
olives used, and personal preference for olives)<br>
1/2 cup (120ml) chicken 
broth<br>
1/4 cup (60ml) dry white wine<br>
2 TBL. juice from preserved lemons
<br><br>
Heat oil over medium-high in a large skillet. In batches, brown 
chicken and place in oven-proof casserole dish or dutch oven. Turn heat down to 
medium-low, and In same oil cook onions until translucent, about 8-10 minutes. 
Add garlic and continue cooking together until garlic is fragrant.<br>
<br>

Meanwhile, scatter remaining 1/4 of the lemon rinds over the casserole, and 
tuck bay leaves between chicken pieces. Add lemon pulp (optional step) and 
olives to the dish, and evenly distribute the onions and garlic over the 
chicken. Add broth, wine and lemon juice. Cover and bake in pre-heated oven for 
45 minutes.<br>

<h1>Power Up!</h1>  April28 2008 Our seven days Unplugged for National 
Turn-off Week was quite a revelation and a wake-up call. Lots happened after 
and immediately before we pulled the power cord. We learned we aren't moving as 
soon as we had thought we would, bid &quot;A hui hou&quot; to a part-time 
resident neighbor, celebrated our anniversary, had epiphanies about the need 
for redundant non-electric back-up systems, re-visited a favorite garden, 
attended a techfest, and received a blog award. Our efforts to stay off the 
grid were aided for nearly a full day by a blown transformer that kept our 
community guessing about when power would be restored (thankfully it was only 
out for 10 hours), but also gave us a chance to test out our new hand-crank 
radio for a few hours.<br>
<br>
Revelations came by way of realizing how much 
information is actually stored on our computers &mdash; important phone 
numbers, for instance. I stopped updating my Rolodex after we moved here, so 
anyone who has moved in the last 3 years we were not able to contact. The blown 
transformer brought this point home again &mdash; what if we lost power in a 
natural disaster for weeks or months? So having a non-electric redundant 
back-up (i.e., my Rolodex!) is top of the priority list this week.<br>
<br>
I 
also realized how cut off I felt not being able to follow-up on the Net with 
things I heard on the radio or read in the papers. And what was the weather 
going to be like today or this weekend? No morning news, no Google weather 
forecast. In fact, the biggest weather news here was kind of a shock because we 
saw it before we heard about it . . . The Return of the Vog! Volcanic ash and 
dust from Kilauea were carried by not-normal southeast winds all the way over 
to here, where a high cloud system evidently kept it &quot;boxed in&quot; over 
the islands. Although this vog was supposedly less of a health issue (less 
sulfuric acid) than previous vog episodes we've had recently, it was many times 
more disconcerting because for the first time since we've lived here . . . . 
all the mountain ranges disappeared, and we were left with the uneasy feeling 
of being spatially displaced. Around here, you tend to think in terms of your 
relation to the mountains, the ocean, Diamond Head, the coasts, etc. With all 
these landmarks shrouded in unending gray, you can feel sort of . . . well, 
lost and out of sorts. Below are photos taken from the beach a 1/2 mile from 
home &mdash; the top was the &quot;view&quot; of Diamond Head and Honolulu last 
Saturday, and below it, the normal view.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
We also saw the 
last of our part-time neighbor, this golden plover, or Kolea . He spends his 
winters feasting in the large yard behind our house, which he defends against 
all others of his kind (he seems perfectly content with other bird species, but 
other Kolea are <em>aves non gratae)</em> . Arriving around mid-August from his 
Alaska nesting grounds, he makes the 3000 mile journey each year non-stop! 
After basking in the Hawaiian sun all winter, he makes his way back to Alaska 
around now to find a mate and raise a brood, which he will leave behind in the 
fall and blithely make his way back to Hawaii. OK, he won't win any bird-parent 
of the year awards, but somehow the fledglings find their way to Hawaii on 
their own! I managed to snap this photo at some distance (he's notoriously 
camera-shy) 2 weeks ago when I noticed his breast plumage had completely 
transformed to solid black and knew he was getting ready for his big trip. We 
haven't seen him for over a week now so luckily he seems to have made it out 
before the disturbing vog rolled in. He'll be back in August. A hui hou?<br>

<br> <br>
<br>
Just before we pulled the plug last week, I made the rounds of 
some of my favorite blogs and learned that Nicisme at Cherrapeno  had named 
ThreeTastes as one of the recipients of the &quot;E for Excellent&quot; award 
badge! It was quite an honor, especially coming from Nic whose blog is my cure 
for my virtual sweet-tooth. Not only does she create the most amazing desserts, 
but she has a great gift for making eye-candy, too. Lucky for me our keyboard 
has a silicone drool guard over it! In fact, I was on her site to get a recipe 
for her pineapple sorbet to try during our time-off (in all the excitement, I 
forgot to print the recipe so I'll be trying it in future). I've had a week to 
consider to whom I will in turn pass on this badge. I still have to type it all 
up and will post the list over the weekend. Mahalo nui loa, Nic! You definitely 
set a bar with your site, I'll try to maintain it here too!<br>
<br>
Finally, 
what do lemons, twigs and chalk, needles and heat lamps, pears, courgettes, 
green tea, and shrimp paste have in common? They're some of the things that 
kept us occupied during the last week. Here's a visual quick peek of what's 
coming up. Stay tuned to this bat-channel, Folks!<br>

<h1>Unplugged: Waimea Valley Audubon Center</h1>  April20 2008  Beginning 
Monday, April 21st, and running through Sunday April 27th, it&rsquo;s National 
&ldquo;Turn Off Week&rdquo; in the U.S. and Canada. Sponsored by the Center for 
Screen-time Awareness, in conjunction with many education and health &amp; 
fitness organizations, the event is meant to highlight our growing reliance on 
all things electronic. It began in the 1990s as a one-day event in which people 
were encouraged to turn off their TVs for 24-hours. But as our dependence on 
other electronic media has grown, so has the scope and duration of the event: 
now participants are encouraged to unplug from their blackberries, cell 
phones(!), iPhones, PCs, laptops, Wiis, xBoxes, etc. for one full week.<br>
<br>
Can you do it? We&rsquo;re going to give it a shot. We&rsquo;re only allowing 
ourselves the radio since it&rsquo;s largely a non-interactive medium, and 
camera because we don't have a non-digital camera. I was going to start a 
series about our experience with acupuncture this week, but we&rsquo;ll pick up 
with that when we return.<br>
<br>
Today we spent the afternoon at the Honolulu 
Academy of Art to visit their special collection, &quot;The Dragon's Gift: The 
Sacred Arts of Bhutan,&quot; which is on view until May 23d. If you haven't 
seen this extraordinary collection, which is based on the Honolulu Academy's 
own expeditions to Bhutan over the last 5 years. The collection is composed 
largely of religious, namely Buddhist, artwork borrowed from active and working 
monasteries; it is supplemented with twice-weekly altar rituals performed by 
Bhutanese monks; videos taken by the Academy's staff of religious dances 
&mdash; some which have never been seen outside the country; and a truly 
innovative multi-media installation by Herbert Mingood, dance photographer for 
the Joffrey Ballet.<br>
<br>
The exhibit is scheduled to tour five other 
museums, the next being the Rubin Museum in New York in September. If you have 
the opportunity to see this rare collection, I hope you will avail yourself of 
the gift. Read more about the exhibit on theAcademy's website, or read the New 
York Times article by Susan Emmerling. <br>
<br>
Bhutan is considered one of 
the most isolated countries in the world, and has the distinction of being the 
only country to have a Gross National Happiness index (how cool is that?). It 
seemed fitting to include mention of this exhibition here since there were no 
TVs in Bhutan before 1999!<br>
<br>
We can't show you anything from the Bhutan 
collection, so to get National Turn Off Week to a proper start, we&rsquo;ll 
leave you with another one our favorite ways to get Unplugged: Waimea Valley 
Audubon Center on Oahu's North Shore.<br>

<h1>Braised Lamb with Chickpeas</h1>  April19 2008 
<p><br>
</p> 
<p>This meal was inspired by 2 different recipes in my favorite Italian 
cookbook. One had pork, chick peas and spinach; the other was a spicy braised 
lamb in a white wine sauce. We ended up with a braised lamb with chickpeas in a 
white wine sauce, with a side of Tuscan kale, served with grilled polenta. 
How's that for going with the flow, working in The Way?<br>
<br>
BRAISED LAMB 
WITH CHICKPEAS<br>
adapted from <em>Trattoria</em>, by Patricia Wells<br>
<br>

Chickpeas:<br>
1 cup (200g) dried chickpeas<br>
</p> <br>
<br>
Wash and rinse 
well. Soak overnight. Drain, and place in a large sauce pan and cover with 6 
cups of water, large bay leaf, and half slice onion. Bring to a boil, then 
reduce heat, cover and cook until chickpeas are tender. Cooking time will vary 
depending on the type of chickpea, and how fresh it is. Test by pressing cooked 
bean between your fingers: it should just resist , then mash. Remove cooked 
beans from heat, remove cover and let cool in liquid until ready to use. If not 
using right away, let cool completely, then store chickpeas with liquid to 
cover in fridge. Drain liquid before adding to meat in the next step, but 
reserve the cooking liquid.<br>
<br>
For the Lamb:<br>
3 TBL. olive oil<br>
5 
anchovy fillets, drained and minced<br>
1/2 tsp. red pepper flakes<br>
1.5 lbs 
(680g) meat from leg of lamb, or shoulder, cut into 3-inch pieces<br>
sea salt
<br>ground black pepper<br>
1 cup (250ml) dry white wine (we used a pinot gris)
<br>1/4 cup red wine vinegar<br>
3 cloves garlic, minced<br>
1/2 tsp. dried 
oregano<br>
<br>
Heat oil and anchovies together over medium-high heat in large 
deep skillet. Add red pepper and cook just until oil takes on pepper color, 
then add lamb meat in batches to brown. Season with sea salt and ground black 
pepper while browning. When all lamb has browned, add wine, vinegar, garlic and 
oregano. Reduce heat to a simmer, cover and cook for 30 minutes. Add drained 
chickpeas, and continue cooking until meat is tender, about another 30-45 
minutes.<br>
<br>
To Finish:<br>
1 tsp flour<br>
3 TBL. reserved cooking liquid 
from beans, or water<br>
<br>
Taste and correct seasoning. Combine flour and 
reserved liquid or water, and stir well. Move meat and beans away from center 
of pan, and add slurry to the center, stirring well. Combine with rest of the 
dish, and cook until the sauce begins to thicken and lose opaque color from the 
flour.<br>
<br>
Serve with polenta, fresh or grilled, and a salad or your 
favorite cooked vegetable.<br>
<br>

<h1>5-A-Day: Tian of Roasted Potatoes &amp; Chinese Mustard Greens</h1>  
April17 2008 <br>
<br>
With yesterday's meal of Portuguese-influenced pork, 
clam and periwinkle stew , we wanted to serve the traditional accompaniment of 
roasted or pan-fried sliced potatoes, but we also wanted a vegetable with some 
bitterness to punctuate the rich and spicy broth in the stew. Rather than make 
2 side dishes, I opted to ease my workload and make only one dish.<br>
<br>
One 
of our favorite vegetables is a simple oven-braised endive, wherein Belgian 
endive or Italian radicchio are cooked to melting tenderness while retaining 
their characteristic bite. I gambled that by layering bitter Chinese mustard 
cabbage under potato slices in the manner of a tian, I could get a bed of 
tender braised greens and crispy potatoes on top. Eureka! It worked.<br>
<br>
A 
tian, like the cataplana in yesterday's post , is the name of both a type of 
dish and the vessel in which it is traditionally cooked. Here, the original 
cookware is a bowl-shaped earthenware vessel, often unglazed, although in the 
hypermarches in France we saw oval or rectangular heavy ceramic dishes with 
5-inch sides also sold as &quot;tians.&quot; Tian recipes feature layered 
vegetables, sometimes combined with cheeses and/or grains, and often topped 
with breadcrumbs. In this version, it was all about the veggies &mdash;  with 
only a little broth, olive oil, garlic and sea salt for enhancement. I would 
gladly have substituted endive or radicchio for the mustard cabbage &mdash; as 
always, use what's local and in season in your area.<br>
<br>
Although the 
seafood and pork stew is a definite no-no for anyone coping with gout, I think 
this vegetarian dish (especially when prepared with vegetable broth) would be 
suitable for a gout-management diet and so will be included in the GDC .<br>

<br> <br>
TIAN OF ROAST POTATOES &amp; CHINESE MUSTARD GREENS<br>
(serves 4 as 
a side dish, 2 as an entree)<br>
<br>
2 medium potatoes, scrubbed and peeled<br>
<br>Slice potatoes cross-wise into thin slices. Toss with olive oil to prevent 
browning. Then sprinkle with sea salt and ground black or white pepper.<br>

Pre-heat oven to 350F/180C.<br>
<br>
Olive oil<br>
1 large head of Chinese 
mustard greens, washed well (instructions) <br>
 (or 2 lbs. of any bitter 
green: radicchio, endive, dandelions, etc.)<br>
4-6 cloves of garlic, sliced<br>
1 cup chicken or vegetable broth<br>
Sea salt, to taste<br>
Gound black pepper, 
or white pepper<br>
<br>
After washing greens well, separate thick stems from 
leaves. Slice stems in julienne. Cut leaves lengthwise, then finely shred 
&mdash; you should have 8-10 cups of leaves. Place stems, then leaves in large 
(10-12 cup) oven-safe casserole. Add garlic, broth, 2 TBL. of olive oil and 
seasoning to taste. Layer potatoes over greens in overlapping rings. You may 
have to press to fit the potatoes atop the greens; but as they cook, the greens 
will wilt. (Alternatively, place the leaves in a large colander and pour 
boiling water over until the greens are just wilted, then layer over stems and 
proceed as above.)<br>
<br>
Place in pre-heated oven and bake for 45 minutes to 
an hour. If potatoes start to brown too quickly, lightly cover with foil (do 
not seal or potatoes will steam and not stay crisp).<br>
<br>
Although this 
dish was devised to accompany the seafood stew , its flavors will also 
accentuate any rich stew &mdash; meat or vegetarian, as well as roasted 
chicken, game fowl, or pork.<br>

<h1>Shoreline Stew: Pork, Clams &amp; Periwinkles</h1>  April16 2008 
<p><br>
</p> 
<p>This savory medley of land and sea combines tender pork with the briny, 
sweet flavors of periwinkles and Manila clams in a lightly spiced wine and 
tomato broth. It is a variation of &quot;Clams Cataplana,&quot; a classic 
Portuguese pork &amp; clams stew. Aside from the addition of the periwinkles, 
the ingredient that most distinguishes this version from the classic is the 
inclusion of tomatoes in the sauce; the original swims solely in a seasoned 
white or light red wine. I'm partial to this version, but T prefers the 
original. We'll do it that way next time. The traditional cataplana is served 
with roasted or pan-fried potato slices, and a crusty loaf to catch every drop 
of sauce. I also wanted a taste of something with a bite, some bitterness to 
counter the rich stew. I devised a simple tian with potatoes and Chinese 
mustard greens that gave us both roasted potatoes and a bitter green (next 
post).<br>
<br>
The periwinkles were a first for us, and we weren't sure what 
to expect. But after Laurie's enthusiastic endorsement in her pre-Christmas
&quot;Seven Days of Seafood,&quot; we've been on the look-out for the tiny 
crustaceans at the fishmongers in Chinatown. Most periwinkles in the U.S. are 
exported from Maine (I forot to ask if these were as well), which was a 
surprise to T, who grew up there and never once tried a periwinkle. A tour 
around the web turned up other enthusiastic periwinkle fans, including Jimmy at
Fishin' Fool Jimmy's, who had recipes and valuable advice on foraging and 
harvesting periwinkles&mdash; free seafood, you gotta love that! &mdash; along 
the U.S. (and Canadian) East Coast and Southeast marshes. In Europe, look for 
bigorneaux or littorines; and in the U.K., winkles.<br>
<br>
The periwinkles 
resemble nothing more than a tiny snail, and were fairly easy to clean: a 
couple of changes of fresh water, and a quick tap of the shell to see if the 
animal responds. Like a clam, the periwinkle will tighten the hard bit of 
shell, or operculum, covering its entrance. Because they were so tiny, we added 
them to the stew in the last 10 minutes of cooking so they wouldn't overcook. 
Though they were a bit tricky to remove from their shell&mdash; T had much more 
success than I in using a pick&mdash; in a pinch, a quick, light tap between 
the jaws of a nutcracker released the meat. The periwinkles were sweeter than 
the clams, with a delicate brininess and mild chew. I would like to try them 
again in a New England style chowder recipe or as a fritter.<br>
<br>
I'm open 
to just about any preparation for these new-found crustaceans&mdash; what's 
your favorite recipe for winkles? Or what did you think of them the first time 
you tried them?<br>
</p> <br>
<br>
PORTUGUESE-STYLE PORK &amp; CLAMS, WITH 
PERIWINKLES<br>
The Sauce:<br>
1 small chourico, or chorizo (about 2-3oz or 
60-85g), cut into 1/2-inch dice<br>
1 lb. (450g) pork tenderloin or shoulder, 
cut in 1-inch cubes<br>
olive oil<br>
1 large onion, diced<br>
3 cloves garlic, 
minced<br>
2-3 small bay leaves<br>
3 tsp. sweet or hot smoked paprika<br>
 (if 
using sweet, can add a pinch of a dried red pepper such as cayenne, Aleppo or 
Korean gochugaru)<br>
12-15oz. (340-420g) chopped and seeded tomatoes<br>
1- 
1.5 cups (240-350ml) dry white wine, such as a Sauvignon Blanc or Pinto Gris<br>
1/4 cup (10g) minced flat-leaf parsley, divided<br>
sea salt (may not be 
needed, depending on the saltiness of the chourico)<br>
<br>
In a large skillet 
over medium-high heat, fry chourico in a smidgen of oil, until browned. Remove 
to bowl. Tip out oil in pan, but do not wash. In same pan, add 2TBL.  olive oil 
and brown pork in 2-3 batches, removing each batch to the bowl with chouricos 
to keep warm.<br>
<br>
In the same pan, turn heat down to medium-low and saute 
onions until translucent (about 8-10 minutes). Add garlic and bay leaves, and 
cook until garlic is fragrant. Add paprika and peppers, if using, stir through 
and cook 1 minute. Turn heat back up to medium-high and add wine, tomatoes and 
half the amount of parsley. Bring sauce just to the boil, then reduce heat to 
low, cover and simmer for 30 minutes while you prepare the crustaceans.<br>
<br>
The crustaceans:<br>
2-3 lbs. (1-1.5kg) Manila or littleneck clams, scrubbed 
and rinsed<br>
 (throw away any that do not close when tapped)<br>
1lb (450g) 
periwinkles, cleaned (optional -- use larger amount of clams if not using 
periwinkles)<br>
Lemon quarters<br>
<br>
Taste sauce and adjust seasoning. 
Bring heat up to medium again, return chouricos and pork to pan, and add clams, 
stir through and cover. Cook for 10 minutes. Add periwinkles, cover again and 
cook another 8 minutes. Without opening cover, turn off heat and keep pan 
covered while plates/bowls are warmed and table is set. Just before serving, 
add last of parsley and squeeze lemon juice over.<br>

<h1>Curry-Glazed Cod with Wasabi-Sesame Soba Salad</h1>  April14 2008 
<p><br>
</p> 
<p>Here's a quick dinner put together with ingredients on hand and very little 
brain work, because there wasn't much left at that point. I'm trying as much as 
possible to reduce our pantry stocks and not buy ingredients for a any one 
particular recipe. So with a couple of filets of Alaskan cod at the ready, I 
opted to serve the fish with a cool salad of buckwheat soba noodles tossed with 
a prepared sea grass salad that is marketed as &quot;Sea Salad&quot; here in 
Hawaii. Chewy buckwheat soba noodles and the sesame-laced sea salad were a nice 
foil for the spices in the tender flaky fish. We liked this salad so much, I 
will try this again with miso butterfish.<br>
<br>
It's been awhile since we've 
had a gout-friendly recipe for theGDC, but I think this recipe might fit the 
bill. Buckwheat is a grain high in protein and gluten-free, and sea grasses of 
all kinds and lemon juice are said to be especially beneficial for 
gout-sufferers. Sesame, too, is touted as a gout-friendly seasoning. If you 
wanted to make this even better for a gout-patient, I might also add julienned 
daikon, or grapes, apples, peas or cooked spinach. The skinned fish filets, 
only moderately seasoned with spices and pan-fried in olive oil, provide 
another measure of protein.<br>
</p> <br>
<br>
CURRY-GLAZED COD WITH 
WASABI-SESAME SOBA SALAD<br>
Serves 2<br>
For the Salad:<br>
7-8 oz. package of 
dried soba noodles, cooked al dente<br>
1-2 cups prepared Sea Salad<br>
1/4 cup 
julienned carrots, about 1/2 small carrot (optional)<br>
1-2 tsp. toasted 
sesame seeds<br>
lemon quarters<br>
<br>
Dressing:<br>
1/2 cup rice vinegar<br>

2 tsp. raw sugar ( or less regular sugar)<br>
pea-size dollop of wasabi paste
<br>sea salt, to taste<br>
ground white pepper, to taste<br>
<br>
Whisk 
together Dressing ingredients. Pour over cooked soba noodles. Toss together 
with Sea Salad and carrots, if using. Squeeze lemon juice atop noodles. 
Sprinkle top with sesame seeds<br>
<br>
<br>
For the Fish:<br>
<br>
Fish Curry 
Spice Mix:<br>
1 TBL. ground coriander<br>
1 tsp. ground cumin<br>
1/2 tsp. 
ground fennel<br>
1/2 tsp. ground turmeric <br>
<br>
Combine spices and set 
aside.<br>
<br>
2 4oz. skinless filets of cod, or other flaky white meat fish
<br>1 TBL. lemon juice per filet<br>
sea salt<br>
ground white pepper<br>
<br>

Sprinkle each side of the filets with lemon juice, then with the curry spice 
mix. Let marinate for 20 minutes.<br>
<br>
Pre-heat pan over medium high heat. 
Season fish with salt and pepper. Add oil to pan, and place white side of filet 
down on pan, and gently press to make full contact. Cook for 2 minutes, then 
turn over and gently press. Cook another 3-4 minutes, or until fish flakes 
under a fork. Meanwhile plate the noodles. Place hot filets on noodles and 
serve immediately.<br>

<h1>National Library Week is coming!</h1>  April10 2008

<br>
Just wanted to remind everyone that next week, April 13-19th, 
is National Library Week in the U.S. It's a time to celebrate the fact that we 
have access to so many great public libraries&mdash; and they're free and open 
for everyone to use. If you haven't visited your local library in awhile, this 
is also a good excuse to re-acquaint yourself with what your library might have 
to offer. Of course, libraries and librarians have always been and remain 
wonderful resources for research. But in addition to a wealth of magazines and 
books, we find at our local libraries: music CDs, audiobooks, keiki 
story-hours, movie and documentary DVDs (including a surprising number of 
foreign language films), downloadable eBooks, and rotating galleries of art, 
photos and seasonal displays. Nor are we limited to what is on hand in our 
neighborhood library, either&mdash; the entire Hawaii public library catalogue 
is available and will be sent to our nearest library for pick-up! We can even 
search the catalogue database and request books on our home computer.<br>
<br>

We have always been supporters and fans of our public (or overseas, the base) 
library. There is always a period when we first move somewhere new, and then 
again just before we leave, when 95% of our worldly possessions are out of our 
reach&mdash; and during those times we virtually haunt the library. We can 
check our emails and surf the Web, learn something about our new community, 
read the paper, or just find a quiet moment. In Hawaii, we have been especially 
engaged by the range of services and events the public library system here 
offers. We can attend evening jazz, folk, and Hawaiian concerts; take hands-on 
workshops on the Japanese art of gift-wrapping with textiles (furoshiki) or 
flower-arranging; sit in on lectures on feng shui or marine photography in the 
NW Hawaiian Islands; listen to tales spun by professional story-tellers; see an 
Afro-Cuban drum and dance troupe perform; or watch old movies on the lawn. This 
week, another use for the library came to light: as ad hoc shelter from the 
heavy vog (volcano ash &quot;fog&quot;) that Kona winds brought our way from 
Madame Pele over there on the Big Island!<br>
<br>
So go spend some time at 
your favorite library next week. You just may find yourself coming back for 
more.<br>
<br>

<h1>Stuffed Artichokes with Italian-style Dressing</h1>  April07 2008 <br>
<br>
Spring has come! And here is a bowl of one of my favorite spring buds. No 
jaunty jonquils, irises or tulips here. We're talking thistles &mdash; to wit, 
artichokes, the green, spiny, tight yet tender, buds of the thistle plant. 
Artichokes are much beloved in our house, even more so after we discovered the 
delicious and therapeutic drink one makes by simply boiling the 'chokes to 
prepare them for the plate (see Artichoke &quot;Tea&quot; ). I was first 
enticed to make artichokes at home by Patricia Ballard's &quot;Artichokes 
Italian&quot; recipe. It was an instant favorite, and is still the first 
artichoke meal we have when the new season's crop first appears. It is 
quintessential San Francisco-style Italian &mdash; fresh ingredients mixed with 
seafood and cured meats in a piquant sauce. Served with a San Francisco 
sourdough to catch the addictive dressing, and a bottle of your favorite pinot 
noir, it is the perfect meal to welcome spring.<br>
<br>
To make a vegetarian 
version, I would double the amount of mushrooms, and substitute 1/2 cup diced 
firm tofu for the tuna, allowing tofu to marinate with the vegetables.<br>
<br>

STUFFED ARTICHOKES WITH ITALIAN DRESSING<br>
(adapted from &quot;Wine in 
Everyday Cooking&quot;)<br>
Marinade for Dressing:<br>
1 cup olive oil<br>
1/2 
cup red-wine vinegar<br>
1/4 cup water<br>
1 TBL. sea salt<br>
1 tsp. raw sugar
<br>1 tsp. dried oregano<br>
1/2 tsp. dried basil<br>
1/2 tsp. dried thyme<br>

1 tsp. dry mustard<br>
1/4 tsp. ground black pepper<br>
3 large cloves garlic, 
finely minced<br>
<br>
small head of cauliflower, divided into small florets<br>
1/2 lb. fresh mushrooms, quartered<br>
2 medium carrots, peeled and sliced thin
<br><br>
Bring all Marinade ingredients to boil in a large saucepan, and allow 
to boil over medium-high heat for about 5 minutes. Taste and correct seasoning 
&mdash; it should taste very vinegary and the herbs quite pronounced since this 
is a vegetable marinade for a dish that will be eaten cool or at room 
temperature. After 5 minutes, add vegetables and bring back to a boil for no 
more than 3 minutes (or vegetables will become mushy and unpalatable as they 
sit in the hot dressing).<br>
<br>
Let cool completely, then refrigerate for at 
least 3-4 hours, but preferably overnight.<br>
<br>
Prepare artichokes:<br>
4 
medium globe artichokes<br>
1 tsp. sea salt (optional)<br>
1 TBL. olive oil 
(optional)<br>
couple of lemon slices (optional)<br>
<br>
Clean artichokes by 
soaking in a solution of 1 gallon of water and 1/4 cup of white vinegar for 
about 2 minutes. Rinse well. Trim tops and side leaves, if desired (this is an 
aesthetic step and does not affect the final flavor; I like the &quot;petal 
effect&quot; the untrimmed leaves gives the final dish, but it can be a bit 
prickly for novice artichoke diners so I would trim them if serving for 
company).<br>
<br>
In large dutch oven or 16 qt. soup pot, place artichokes 
stem side down in water that comes half-way up the sides of the vegetables. If 
you have no intention of using the cooking liquid as a &quot;tea&quot; ( 
benefits of artichoke &quot;tea&quot; ), you can season the water with the 
optional ingredients. Bring water to a boil, then turn heat down to medium and 
simmer for 30-45 mnutes, or until the base is tender when pierced with a fork. 
Remove from water and drain upside-down in colander.<br>
<br>
If using cooking 
liquid as a beverage, strain carefully and enjoy as a hot or cool beverage.<br>

<br>When artichokes have cooled, spread leaves open and remove spiny interior 
leaves surrounding the hairy center &quot;choke.&quot; Using a small teaspoon, 
gently scrape out the choke to create a vessel for the dressing. Artichokes can 
be cooked ahead, refrigerated, and brought to room temperature 30 minutes 
before serving, or while the Dressing is completed.<br>
<br>
<br>
Finish the 
Dressing:<br>
1/2 cup green or black olives, halved<br>
10 slices of prosciutto 
or 12 slices of salami<br>
1 7 oz, can of tuna in olive oil (do not drain)<br>

<br><br>
Combine marinated vegetables, olives, cured meat and tuna. Stir 
through carefully and set aside at least 30 minutes.<br>
<br>
Traditionally, 
these artichokes are served in wide shallow bowls, such as a pasta bowl. I 
prefer a deep bowl like the cafe au lait bowl in the photo below because it 
supports the stuffed artichoke and has the added advantage of allowing the 
dressing to pool on the bottom and season the artichoke heart as you feast your 
way to the bottom. Spoon the Dressing into the center of each artichoke. Add 
any remaining dressing around each stuffed vegetable, and drizzle the remaining 
marinade between the artichoke leaves. Serves 4 as a first course, or 2 as an 
entree.<br>
<br>
<br>
Best served with a tangy sourdough loaf, but any good 
artisan bread will do. We found it helps to begin with the inner leaves of the 
artichoke, and eat your way to the outside. You'll find each leaf base is 
already &quot;dipped&quot; in the savory Dressing marinade. <br>
<br>
One of 
our favorite uses for left-over Dressing is to hollow out the bottom of a small 
baguette or other hoagie-type roll, fill it with the Dressing (and cold cuts, 
if you want a real carnivore's delight), then encase it with plastic wrap for 
at least an hour &mdash; the oil-vinegar dressing soaks the bread to create a 
muffaletta-type sandwich. For a less-messy option, combine Dressing with cooked 
tubular or small shell pastas, or brown rice for a quick lunch salad.<br>

<h1>A Caponata to Feed the Soul</h1>  April03 2008 
<p><br>
</p> 
<p>It was when I first tasted the Italian appetizer Caponata that I decided I 
must have been Italian in another life. It spoke to me &mdash; this unctuous 
relish, calling me home to a distant Mediterranean shore I had yet to visit. 
Everything about it was at once familiar and a revelation.<br>
<br>
I was 
determined to find the definitive recipe. In those pre-Web days (I'm dating 
myself now), it took a bit of work to track down cookbooks and scour magazines. 
During the trial for the second recipe I found, a friend who had emigrated to 
the US from Sicily happened to stop by so he was a natural target for my 
efforts. I loved this version, but what would a real Italian think?<br>
<br>

&quot;I'm testing a caponata recipe, will you taste it and tell me what you 
think?&quot; I asked. Eying me with a combination of curiosity and suspicion 
(what does this girl from Guam know about caponata?), he asked me how I even 
knew about caponata. I told him I had tried it in a restaurant in The City (San 
Francisco). With bemused indulgence, he accepted the proffered baguette slice 
and heaped a generous dab of the chunky relish. One bite. Surprise. Delight. A 
second bite. Approval.<br>
<br>
&quot;Wow, are you sure you're not 
Italian?&quot; he joked. I confessed my suspicions about having lived a 
previous incarnation in Italia. Munching through a second caponata-laden 
baguette, he crowed, &quot;Not just Italian, Baby, you must have been 
Sicilian!&quot; There is no higher praise.<br>
<br>
CAPONATA ALLA SICILIANA<br>

(adapted from a<em>San Jose Mercury News</em> clipping)<br>
2 medium eggplant 
(1.25lb total), peeled and diced<br>
1.5 tsp. salt (for optional step) <br>
1/3 
cup olive oil<br>
1 large onion, diced<br>
1 clove garlic, minced<br>
3 ribs 
celery, diced<br>
1 large carrot, finely diced<br>
2 lbs ripe tomatoes, peeled, 
seeded and diced<br>
 (or 1 15oz can diced tomatoes with juice)<br>
2 TBL. red 
wine vinegar<br>
2 tsp. sugar<br>
1 tsp. sea salt<br>
1/3 cup black olives, 
pitted and chopped<br>
2 TBL. capers, drained<br>
1/4 cup pine nuts, toasted 
(optional)<br>
2 TBL. parsley, minced<br>
sea salt and ground black pepper<br>

<br>(Optional Step: I used to do this because it was in the original recipe, 
but have found that if the eggplant is properly browned, this step is 
unnecessary.) Toss eggplant with salt and drain in colander 30 min. Rinse and 
pat dry.<br>
<br>
In large skillet, brown eggplant in 1/4 cup oil over 
medium-high heat until all sides are golden brown. Remove from pan.<br>
<br>
In 
remaining oil, saute onion, garlic, celery and carrots until vegetables are 
soft, but not colored. Add tomatoes, vinegar, sugar, salt and olives, bring mix 
to a boil. Lower heat, return browned eggplant, and simmer uncovered for 10 
minutes, stirring occasionally<br>
<br>
Add capers, nuts and parsley. Transfer 
to bowl to cool. Chill overnight. Season to taste before serving at room 
temperature with thick slices of sourdough baguette.<br>

<h1>Programming Note: Merrie Monarch Festival 2008</h1>  April01 2008 The 
world's premier hula event, The Merrie Monarch Festival, begins Thursday 
evening at 6:30 p.m., Hawaii Standard Time (no Daylight Savings here), and runs 
through Saturday night. Viewers worldwide can watch each evening's competition 
over streaming video broadcast by Hawaii's ABC local affiliate, KITV, at 
http://www.kitv.com/merriemonarch/index.html <br>
<br>
Thursday evening is the 
Miss Aloha Hula competition: solo dancers chosen by their <em>halau</em> , or 
dance school, perform hula in both traditional ( <em>kahiko</em> ) and modern ( 
<em>auana</em> ) styles<br>
<br>
Friday and Saturday evenings, all competing 
halau, in separate men's and women's performances, dance each style. Beginning 
at 6 p.m., each evening's competition usually runs about 5-6 hours!<br>
<br>

The Merrie Monarch Festival is not just a dance competition, but also focuses 
on keeping all the traditions associated with hula alive, including chanting, 
musicianship, lei-weaving, tapa-making, elder respect, etc. In the past, the

<h1>Grilled Ehu in Banana Leaf</h1>  March30 2008 <br>
<br>
Isn't it always 
the case that when you're looking really hard for something, you don't find it? 
When our friend Maia brought her parents, June &amp; Rob, to visit Oahu last 
month, we wanted to barbecue a fish that would be new to them, something only 
available in a Pacific locale. We wanted a parrotfish &mdash;  large &amp; 
colorful, with flaky white meat, it seemed the perfect combination of exotic 
but palatable. Parrotfish are available regularly in the markets and 
fishmongers, but we usually hesitate to buy one because they are rarely smaller 
than 4lbs., which is too large for just us two. But on this occasion we had my 
father and our guests, so it seemed the opportune time. Except that parrotfish 
suddenly disappeared from the market ice displays. Everywhere. Maybe it was the 
convergence of the Hawaii presidential primary and the American football 
Pro-Bowl game in the same week, but whatever the reason: no parrotfish.<br>
<br>
<br> So we ended up with the less exotic, but no less toothsome, Yellow-striped 
Red Snapper, or Ehu. Once stuffed with herbs and coconut, and grilled in fresh 
banana leaves, the Ehu were a swimming <em>(sorry, couldn't resist)</em>  
addition to our home-grown luau: grilled ehu, pork laulau, kalbi beef, 
huli-huli chicken, assorted poke, sesame watercress, green papaya salad, poi, 
and rice. And Ted's macadamia nut pie after a walk to the beach to see the 
sunset.<br>
<br>
GRILLED EHU (RED SNAPPER) IN BANANA LEAF<br>
2 banana leaves, 
cleaned and oiled<br>
2 Ehu (1-1.5 lb each), scaled and cleaned<br>
<br>
sea 
salt<br>
fresh ground pepper<br>
4-5 cilantro roots<br>
8-10 wild (sometimes 
called <em>kaffir</em> ) lime leaves <br>
large sprig of cilantro<br>
1 lime, 
sliced<br>
1/2 cup grated coconut<br>
<br>
! lime, quartered<br>
<br>
<br>

Rinse and pat fish dry. Place each fish on a banana leaf, then make 2 slashes 
on each side.<br>
In a mortar, pound together cilantro roots, salt and pepper. 
Put a bit of the paste in all the slits.<br>
<br>
Season the cavity of each 
fish, then fill with lime leaves and slices, cilantro and coconut. Roll banana 
leaf around fish. Oil outside of each packet, then place on pre-heated grill.
<br>Grill about 8-12 minutes each side, depending on the size of your fish. 
Remove packets from heat, and leave wrapped until service. When unwrapped, 
squeeze fresh lime juice over whole fish.<br>
<br>
The smoky, citrus flavors of 
this preparation go well with either poi or rice, and a lightly cooked salad 
such as Sesame-dressed Watercress  or Warabi .<br>

<h1>Mango Season 2008: The First Wave</h1>  March26 2008 <br>
<br>
The lead 
photo is entered in this month's CLICK event hosted by Bee &amp; Jai at
Jugalbandi, where the theme for April is <em>Au Naturel</em> . <br>
<br>
<br>

<br> Like the surf that gained Hawaii its fame, mango season rolls in wave sets 
&mdash;  spread throughout the year as different varieties and locales around 
the Islands blossom, fruit, and ripen. Although many trees here are still in 
full bud,we found these red beauties a couple of weeks ago, beckoning at us 
from a lone stand at the farmers' market in our town. Sometimes even the most 
gorgeous, perfumed mangos can be stringy on the inside, making them difficult 
to cut or present in any fashion. These, however, were perfect &mdash;  firm, 
fully-ripe flesh that cut cleanly and easily from the pit. This is a Hayden 
variety, and was an epitome of its specimen. Not only sweet, but redolent of 
mango juciness and flavor. I ate this first one as soon as the photo op was 
over. <em>Hmmm, maybe T would be expecting some, too. Better not cut the second 
one until he was in the vicinity or it would be proverbial toast, too.</em> <br>
<br>After living here for 3 short years, I'm only just beginning to develop the 
self-discipline to even consider doing anything with a mango except just eat 
it. Why cover up that succulent flavor with spices, or herbs, or anything!? In 
the last few months, beginning with the Double Mango Bread  that was conceived 
for my first foray in the world of blog events, I've experimented with fresh 
mangoes with meat dishes, oatmeal, salsas, etc., but to be honest, I'd rather 
enjoy the mango <em>au naturel </em> &mdash; <em> </em> naked, if you will . 
<br><br>
But last weekend I did venture to make a stuffed french toast with 
fresh mangoes. It was deemed a worthy use of this most noble fruit. I love 
egg-y french toast, or <em>pain perdu</em>  (if we're being picky about it). I 
prefer to leave the bread to soak overnight in a copious egg-mik sop, heavy 
with vanilla and a bit of cinnamon. But with the mangoes, I wanted something 
lighter, something less bread-pudding-ish, that would showcase the fruit itself.
<br><br>
The trick to this preparation is to leave the interior of the bread 
slices dry so the result is a creamy yet light toast that allows the fresh 
fruit to star. A crumb topping provides a contrasting crunch. We loved this 
lighter french toast &mdash; it tasted sinful without leaving us feeling 
weighed down afterwards. Make this with any seasonal fruit. I don't really like 
cinnamon with mango, so I didn't use it or any other flavoring except a kiss of 
vanilla. With other fruits, though, I would think of complementary flavor 
combinations: almond extract and nuts with peaches, cherries and other stone 
fruits; stronger vanilla or even banana with strawberries; cinnamon and cloves 
with apples or bananas; lemon with blueberries; etc.<br>
<br>
This recipe is 
made with whole grain wheat bread because we are trying to eat more healthily 
(and that's what we had on hand that morning). (Made with whole wheat, this is 
something I would serve my dad on his gout-maintenance diet, so it will go into 
the GDC .) No question you could substitute an egg bread, such as Hawaiian 
sweet or challah, for a truly decadent feast.<br>
<br>
This recipe goes out to 
Mansi, the genial host at Fun and Food  for her &quot;Balanced Breakfast&quot; 
theme for the 20th ed. of Weekend Breakfast Blogging . Have a wonderful weekend!
<br> <br>
MANGO-STUFFED WHOLE-WHEAT FRENCH TOAST<br>
(for 2 persons, double or 
triple recipe as needed)<br>
<br>
Fruit from 1-3 fully ripe mango (if using a 
meaty Hayden, you may only need one if you can refrain from sneaking too many 
nibbles as you prepare the fruit; from the smaller Champagne (Ataulfo) or Pirie 
varieties, you may need as many as 3)<br>
<br>
You can mash or dice the mango, 
especially if it shows any signs of being stringy. I left it in slices because 
this particular mango cut like butter anyway, and we like the texture of the 
fruit this way.<br>
<br>
Pre-heat oven to 400F (200C). A countertop or large 
toaster oven is perfect for a 2-person serving.<br>
<br>
2 large or 3 medium 
eggs<br>
1/2 cup (120ml) almond milk (or soy or low-fat milk)<br>
1/2 tsp. 
vanilla extract<br>
1 tsp. raw sugar<br>
4 slices of whole wheat bread<br>
<br>

Beat together eggs, milk, vanilla and sugar. Dip each side of bread in this 
mixture, then leave bread to soak up remaining milk while you prepare the 
topping.<br>
<br>
Topping:<br>
1 slice of bread<br>
1/4 cup (40g) macadamia 
nuts, chopped<br>
2 TBL. raw sugar<br>
<br>
Process bread, nuts and sugar in 
small bowl of food processor or blender.<br>
<br>
To assemble:<br>
2 TBL. (30g) 
unsalted butter, melted<br>
2 tsp. raw sugar, or to taste<br>
<br>
Butter a 
small baking dish. Lay 2 slices of soaked bread on the bottom. Top with mango 
slices (dice, or puree). Sprinkle fruit with 1 tsp. of raw sugar. Top with 
second slice of bread. Liberally sprinkle bread-nut topping, then drizzle with 
melted butter.<br>
<br>
<br>
Bake in pre-heated oven for 5 minutes, then turn 
oven down to 325F (for another 25 minutes). If top starts to brown to quickly, 
cover with foil to protect crust.<br>
<br>
Serve while hot, with whipped cream 
or creme fraiche.<br>

<h1>When Life hands you green papayas . . .</h1>  March26 2008 
<p><br>
</p> 
<p>There is no fruit in the Hawaiian Islands I love more than papaya. Mangoes 
come a close second; but we've been able to find delicious mango varieties when 
we've lived in non-tropical parts of the world, never so with papayas. Never. I 
think you have to be close to the source to get a truly delicious papaya. We've 
been tempted and tricked by beautiful deep orange-colored papayas in markets in 
Europe and the US East Coast, but were always disappointed by the sweet, but 
vapid and watery fruit that met our spoons.<br>
</p> <br>
Hawaii, though, is 
papaya heaven. Orange flesh, red flesh &mdash;  it's all good. With a squeeze 
of lime, it's perfectly papaya-sweet. And it's jaw-droppingly cheap. Fifty-nine 
cents a pound, on sale; but even at .79, .99, 1.29 per pound, way way below 
Mainland and Continental prices. On our last trip to the Big Island, some 
vendors at the Hilo Market were selling 5 papayas for $2 &mdash;  that's not 5 
lbs, but 5 whole papayas! ( <em>Have spoon, will travel.</em> ) And so we have 
papaya as often as possible, which is not every day so it's still not often 
enough.<br>
<br>
<br>
Having said this, there are other ways to enjoy papayas 
when the fresh ripe ones are not the best choice. Eat it green. Like bananas, 
papayas enjoy a different life as a green fruit. Treated more as a vegetable, 
the firm white or slightly pink flesh of an under-ripe papaya can be diced and 
added to soups or stews, as one might with squash or gourds (see Chicken Tinola 
), or julienned and lightly dressed with a tangy lime and fish sauce to make a 
refreshing salad. Growing up on Guam, my favorite pickle in the world was 
pickled green papaya, similar to the southeast Asian style salads, but 
marinated only in vinegar, boonie peppers (donne) and salt.<br>
<br>
With a 
benriner, mandoline, or julienne-peeler, making green papaya salad is a snap. 
And don't confine this salad to southeast Asian themed meals. A nice 
palate-cleanser with rich curries or stews, as well as deep-fried and grilled 
foods, a papaya salad brings a touch of the tropics to any meal. We've even 
used it to liven up the next day's lunch &mdash;  it becomes a punchy condiment 
for a meatloaf sandwich, or a last minute pasta salad with the addition of 
chicken and somen or soba noodles.<br>
<br>
Note: Green papayas are light in 
weight for their size &mdash;  their seeds are not developed and their flesh, 
while moist, is not heavy and juicy like their fully-ripened brethren.<br>
<br>

GREEN PAPAYA SALAD<br>
(adapted from <em> </em> <em>Hot Sour Salty Sweet</em> 
<em> by Alford &amp; Duguid</em> )<br>
<br>
1lb. green papaya (approximate 
weight), peeled and julienned<br>
<br>
Toss with 2 tsp. sea salt and leave for 
30 minutes. Rinse well, and drain. <br>
<br>
<br>
Dressing:<br>
1 large garlic 
clove <br>
1 TBL. chopped dry-roast peanuts<br>
1  TBL.  dried shrimp, chopped 
<br> 1-2 fresh red chilies<br>
1  tsp. raw sugar (or 1/2 tsp. white sugar )<br>

1/2 tsp. sea salt<br>
<br>
Place ingredients in a mortar, and pound together to 
make a wet paste. (If you want the salad to be less spicy, don't add the whole 
pepper(s) to the mortar. Simply slice the bottom half of the pepper, avoiding 
the seeds, and add that to the paste mixture, or add the slices to the dressing 
below. But don't leave the peppers out completely or the balance will be 
&quot;off.&quot;)<br>
<br>
Juice of 3 limes (to make about 1/3 cup)<br>
2-3 
TBL. fish sauce (Thai fish sauces tend to be saltier and fishier than 
Vietnamese or Filipino fish sauces, so how much you use depends on the brand 
and personal taste)<br>
Cilantro or mint, minced (optional) <br>
<br>
In a 
large bowl that can accommodate all the julienned papaya, combine lime juice 
and fish sauce, then add paste. Stir well, then taste. It should hint at all 
the primal flavors of the tropics &mdash;  salty, sweet, hot and sour. When the 
balance is to your liking, add papaya and cilantro. Let sit for 10 minutes 
before serving.

<h1>Fingerling Potatoes with Fenugreek </h1>  March25 2008 
<p><br>
</p> 
<p>I came across this intriguing recipe while browsing through Dhivya's massive
Potato Fe(a)st Event at DK's Culinary Bazaar earlier this month. It came from 
Eskay atA Bon Vivant's Chow Chronicle and she called it Fenugreek'ed Potatoes, 
named after the defining herb in the recipe. Fenugreek is used as both a spice 
and an herb. As a spice, it's available as triangular, amber-colored seeds 
prized for its distinct bitterness. Along with turmeric, it adds most of the 
defining color and flavor to commercial &quot;curry powders.&quot;<br>
<br>
As 
an herb, it can be found in both fresh and dried forms at specialty Indian 
markets. I've seen fenugreek seeds both bottled and sold by the ounce at health 
food stores here and on the Mainland, but not the leaves. Even at specialty 
stores, the fresh leaves can be hard to come by unless the shop caters to a 
sizable Indian population. However the dried form, called Kasoori Methi, is 
usually on the shelves. Dried methi leaves have a pleasing clean, minty, and 
almost astringent aroma. When fried lightly in hot oil, as in this recipe, it 
becomes nutty and smoky. The amazing change in character is reminiscent of the 
transformation of a fresh green jalapeno pepper to a smoky chipotle.<br>
</p> 
<br> <br>
I had only used kasuri methi in a handful of recipes, and they were 
usually part of a large mix of other spices and herbs, so I really could not 
have told you what fenugreek leaves on their own tasted like. Eskay's recipe 
really stood out because it highlighted the flavor of fenugreek. I had some 
dried methi leaves (or so I thought), and we had just scored a bag of 
fingerling potatoes, so it seemed like a perfect time to try this! I first 
attempted to make this last week as a side for some ribs, but found that my 
poorly-secured bag of methi leaves had become infested with bugs. Ick! Luckily 
we had a chance to drive through the university district and stop by the India 
Market to stock up on some staples. I passed it at least five times on the 
shelf because the new box was spelled differently (&quot;Qasuri Methi&quot; 
&mdash;  it might also be spelled &quot;Kasuri&quot;), but finally realized 
what I was seeing.<br>
<br>
This was part of our Easter Sunday meal with Lamb 
Rib Chops &amp; Lentils Catalane , steamed asparagus, and a cucumber and radish 
raita (yogurt salad). The earthy, smoked flavors worked surprisingly well with 
the sunny flavors of the lamb and lentils. In fact, the lentils and potatoes 
complemented each other so well I couldn't resist making a grilled sandwich 
with them: whole wheat bread, garlic mayo on the potato side, Kasoori Methi 
Potatoes, and Lentils Catalane, grilled with olive oil = Heaven!<br>
<br>
One 
note: I cut larger potatoes down to the size of the smallest ones for even 
cooking, and found the cut ones had the added bonus of absorbing more of the 
spice flavors (no surprise). If you prefer skin-on whole potatoes, you may want 
to cut or at least score the potatoes after steaming, but before frying, to 
allow the spices to reach the buttery potato interior.<br>
<br>
We've grown to 
really love tangy, sour flavors &mdash;  whether it's tamarind in curries; 
powdered sumac on grilled meats; wild lime leaves in Laotian stews; or dried 
whole limes in Persian stews. If you enjoy any of these flavors, don't skip the 
sprinkling of amchoor powder in the first step.<br>
<br>
KASOORI METHI POTATOES
<br>(adapted from Eskay's Fenugreek'ed Potatoes )<br>
<br>
2 lb. fingerling 
potatoes<br>
1/2-1 tsp. amchoor, aka dried green mango powder (optional)<br>
1 
tsp. sea salt <br>
<br>
Scrub well, and cut larger potatoes in halves or 
thirds. Steam or boil potatoes until just cooked. Peel potatoes, if desired (we 
prefer the skins on). Combine amchoor and salt, then liberally season potatoes 
while still warm. (If not using amchoor, season to taste with sea salt.) Keep 
aside. <br>
<br>
<br>
2 tsp. coriander seed<br>
1 tsp. cumin seed<br>
<br>
In a 
mortar, grind together coriander and cumin seeds to make a fine powder. <br>

<br>3 TBL.  olive oil <br>
5 TBL.  kasoori methi<br>
1 tsp. cayenne pepper (or 
Aleppo)<br>
sea salt <br>
<br>
Heat oil in wok or large skillet over medium 
heat. Add spices, cayenne, and methi leaves and cook for 3-4 minutes. Add 
potatoes and stir through to coat with leaves and spices. Cover, reduce heat 
and cook together for 10-15 minutes. Remove from heat and keep covered until 
serving.<br>
<br>
For a vegetarian meal, Eskay recommends rice or rotis, and a 
dal (see earlier posts: Tarka Dal  or Mung Bean &amp; Gourd Stew ). We found it 
a perfect accompaniment to grilled lamb, as well as a hearty sandwich filling 
with lentils.<br>

<p></p> 
<p><br>
UPDATE: I was delighted to see lavaterra in Germany try this recipe as 
part of a vegetarian meal, along with a spring salad. You can see her version,

<h1>Lamb Rib Chops &amp; Lentils Catalane</h1>  March24 2008 
<p><br>
</p> 
<p>I will usually order lamb if it's on a menu, especially lemon &amp; garlic 
infused rib chops like these. We don't have them at home very often, but this 
Easter they were a perfect fit for our intimate stay-home dinner. Lamb and 
lentils have a natural affinity for each other, but this particular recipe for 
Lentils Catalane is the best we've tried and everyone who has ever tried them 
has refused to leave without the recipe. Thing is, the ingredients list 
couldn't be more mundane&mdash; all simple pantry items: lentils, onions, 
garlic, olive oil, salt, pepper, tomato paste, oregano and thyme. The key to 
the wonderful flavor? There are two, actually.<br>
<br>
One, use roughly equal 
weights of onions and lentils, then cook the onions until completely 
translucent. Believe it or not, this is the step where the dish will most often 
go astray&mdash; if the onions are still slightly opaque when the other 
ingredients are added, the moment is lost and the recipe will not taste quite 
as heavenly, no matter how much longer the dish is cooked.<br>
<br>
Two, cook 
the tomato paste before adding the lentils. That's it!&mdash; now you have the 
keys and this wonderful recipe is open to you. It is a wonderful accompaniment 
to any grilled meat&mdash; but is at its coquettish best with lamb. Having said 
that, these lentils are so savory and flavorful on their own, they would make a 
wonderful tortilla wrap or pita filling, too. Last night we made the 
serendipitous discovery that they also married well with theFenugreek Potatoes, 
so the 2 together would make a filling and luscious vegetarian sandwich or 
pizza.<br>
<br>
Oh, there is one catch. Make the lentils at least 24 hours 
before you intend to use or serve them. Because they are cooked separately from 
the base, the lentils need the overnight in the fridge to really meld the 
flavors together.<br>

Combine all 
marinade ingredients in glass bowl and add lamb. Cover and refrigerate at least 
4 hours, but no longer than 8.<br>
<br>
Remove to room temperature 30 minutes 
before grilling. Grill to desired doneness.<br>
<br>
<br>
LENTILS CATALANE<br>

(Prepare 24 hours before service)<br>
<br>
10 oz. (280g) French green (Puy) 
lentils, or other green lentils<br>
<br>
Wash and rinse through lentils in 
several changes of water, and remove any small pebbles. Place in a small (2qt) 
saucepan and cover with water by at least 2 inches, and place lid slightly 
ajar. Over medium high heat, bring to a boil, then reduce heat to medium-low 
and simmer for 30-40 minutes, or until lentils are just soft (cooking time will 
depend on the freshness of the lentils). Remove from heat, cover and keep to 
one side.<br>
<br>
While lentils are cooking, prepare the base:<br>
2 medium 
brown onions, about 280g when minced<br>
5 TBL. olive oil<br>
4 cloves garlic, 
minced<br>
4 TBL. tomato paste<br>
sea salt<br>
ground black pepper<br>
1 tsp. 
dried oregano<br>
1/2 tsp. dried thyme<br>
<br>
Cook onions in covered skillet 
or small dutch oven over low heat until they are semi-translucent, about 8-10 
minutes, then add garlic. Return cover and continue cooking until onions are 
completely translucent (they will taste sweet and mellow), about another 5-8 
minutes, depending on your pan.<br>
<br>
<br>
Move onions away from center of 
the pan and put tomato paste in the center. Press tomato paste against bottom 
of pan to maximize contact between the pan and paste. Stir to bring more paste 
in contact with heat &mdash;  you will see the paste begin to change color from 
bright candy apple red to a darker red pepper color. Begin to incorporate the 
onions into the paste, add salt and pepper, then cover and let cook on low heat 
for about 5 minutes. Add oregano and thyme, stir through and cook together for 
another 5 minutes or until you begin to smell the herbs come through the tomato 
fragrance.<br>
<br>
Using a slotted soon, remove lentils from cooking liquid 
and add to tomato mixture. Add enough of the cooking liquid to allow the 
lentils and base to combine, but not become soupy (usually 2-3 TBL. does the 
trick). Heat together for 10 minutes. Then let cool in pan. Remove to container 
to chill overnight.<br>
<br>
When ready to serve, re-heat gently in the oven or 
microwave. (optional step) Add 4-5 drops of toasted sesame seed oil and 
incorporate.<br>

<h1>Fettucine mit Pfiff</h1>  March20 2008 
<p><br>
</p> 
<p>In German, the term &quot;mit Pfiff&quot; connotes an &quot;extra 
something,&quot; or &quot;with a kick&quot; and this fettucine had both. One 
day last week T offered to make dinner so I could continue packing boxes. He 
devised an all-vegetable marinara-based sauce with a most innovative twist: 
sauteed mushrooms to top the pasta, rather than be incorporated in it. I have 
to tell you, for a shroom-fiend like me, it was sheer genius. The mushrooms 
were boozy and buttery atop the chunky, spicy marinara and retained that 
separate distinction even when mixed through with a fork. With a glass of 
Zinfandel, it was pure heaven.<br>
<br>
There's no recipe here, he used what 
vegetables we had on hand and a bottled marinara, as well as a pound of cremini 
mushrooms, sherry and butter. I'm just here to brag on my husband! (If you knew 
him when we first met, he used to put a frozen chicken breast in the microwave, 
cook it, stick a fork in it and douse it with Tabasco and call it &quot;Chicken 
a la (insert name here)&quot; <br>
<br>
You've come a long way, Chef T!</p>

<h1>A Case of Mistaken Identity</h1>  March20 2008 <br>
<br>
As a once avid 
scuba diver, I used to pride myself on my ability to recognize and name many 
fish and other denizens of the reef and deep. I was a diver who was perfectly 
content to hang out on one spot on the reef to see how many fish, eels, 
turtles, snails, worms, sponges, etc., I could spy rather than trying to cover 
a lot of sea turf. The blue spine unicorn fish (&quot;Tataga,&quot; on Guam; 
and &quot;Kala,&quot; in Hawaii) was an old friend, seen on almost every dive. 
I knew this fish more for its boldness (he'll come right up to a diver and 
point his one-corn right at you &mdash;  sadly, waiting for a hand-out), than 
its culinary delights. But when I first saw kala in the fish markets here, I 
had a strong memory of feasting on this at a barbecue on Guam. I remembered it 
had a tough leathery skin that could be put over direct flame without 
scorching, and which peeled away from firm white flesh. It was also recorded in 
my brain that it was rather delectable.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
This is how I was 
accustomed to seeing a unicorn fish &mdash;  pointed, blank stare and teeth 
bared.<br>
<br>
Alas, somewhere in the last 10 years since I left home, my 
memory has been failing me. I got his name right, the tough leathery skin is 
right, the firm white flesh is right. But the taste . . . hmmm, here my memory 
seems to have led me astray. This is a fish for the very strong of heart! It 
has a distinct and pungent smell &mdash;  earthy and gamey, even when cooked 
with Alaea salt, lemon peel and juice, garlic and parsley stuffed in its 
cavity. I think this would probably be better prepared in a stew with coconut 
milk, lemongrass, onions and other equally robust flavors to mellow out its 
racy flavors. Fortunately we did have on hand a punchy Garlic Salsa that 
married well with the kala's fustiness . <br>
<br>
So what fish waxed so fondly 
in memory? I've thought about that a lot since The Night of the Unicorn, and 
searching through the mists of memory I now believe it was a napoleon wrasse, 
which was also part of that same barbecue and which also sports a bump on its 
head, albeit a much less showy one ( photo  on Wikipedia). <br>
<br>
GARLIC 
SALSA<br>
(adapted from <em>Fish Dishes of the Pacific from the Fishwife</em> )
<br>2 heads of garlic<br>
3 TBL. olive oil<br>
2 serrano chilies, seeded and 
sliced<br>
28 oz. of canned, organic diced tomatoes (reserve juice)<br>
1 TBL. 
red wine vinegar<br>
sea salt and ground black pepper<br>
1/2 tsp. raw sugar 
<br>2 large sprigs cilantro, minced<br>
<br>
Peel garlic cloves, and cut 
largest cloves in half, so that all pieces are about the size of a marble. 
Gently cook garlic cloves in olive oil over low heat until they begin to 
soften. Add chilies, and cook until you can start to smell the chilies.<br>
<br>
Turn heat up to medium, and add tomatoes and half of the reserved juice, as 
well as vinegar, sea salt and pepper . Cook, uncovered for 10 minutes, or until 
tomatoes change to a dark burgundy color, and most of the liquid evaporates. 
Add sugar and cilantro, and cook another 5 minutes. Cover and let cool.<br>
<br>
Serve with any grilled meat or game. Or gamey fish.

<h1>One Perfect Chocolate Cupcake</h1>  March16 2008 
<p><br>
</p> 
<p>I'm the first to admit that I'm not a prolific baker. When I do bake, I 
have to be assured that most of my creation will end up in other hands, so it 
doesn't end up on my hips! Two pre-schoolers and their chocolate-loving mom 
brought out this recipe for chocolate cupcakes. Cocoa powder alone will not do, 
in my book&mdash; to deliver real chocolate flavor, there has to be melted 
chocolate. Only half the batter got the extra shot of dark chocolate chips, so 
the munchkins' parents had<em>some</em> control of how much caffeine they got 
after dinner!<br>
<br>
This recipe produces a cake with a very tender crumb and 
a smooth, pleasing chocolate flavor that both kids and adults will enjoy.<br>

<br>CHOCOLATE CUPCAKES<br>
(Makes 2 dozen cupcakes or 2 9-in. round layer cakes)
<br>6oz (170g) dark chocolate, roughly chopped <br>
3/4 cup (180ml) almond milk
<br>3 TBL. plain full-fat yogurt<br>
 (or use 1 cup buttermilk instead of 
almond milk/yogurt mixture)<br>
1 tsp. vanilla extract<br>
2 cups (200g) 
all-purpose flour<br>
3 TBL. cocoa powder<br>
3/4 tsp. sea salt<br>
1 tsp. 
baking soda<br>
1 cup (230g) unsalted butter, softened <br>
1-1/2 cups (290g) 
raw sugar (demerara)<br>
4 large eggs, at room temperature <br>
1 cup (180g) 
chocolate chips, Ghirardelli's extra dark (optional)<br>
<br>
Place chocolate 
in double boiler over simmering water for approximately 5&ndash;10 minutes. 
Stir occasionally until completely smooth. Remove from the heat and let cool 
5&ndash;10 minutes.<br>
<br>
Combine almond milk, yogurt, and vanilla. Stir 
well and set aside.<br>
<br>
Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Line two 12-cup 
muffin tins with cupcake papers. Set<br>
aside. <br>
<br>
In a small bowl, sift 
together flour, cocoa, salt and baking soda. Set aside.<br>
<br>
In a large 
bowl, cream butter until smooth. Add sugar and beat on medium speed until<br>

fluffy, about 3 minutes. Add the eggs, one at a time, beating well after each 
addition.<br>
Add chocolate, mixing until well incorporated. Add dry 
ingredients in three parts,<br>
alternating with milk mixture. With each 
addition, beat until the ingredients are just<br>
incorporated &mdash; do not 
over-beat. Scrape down the batter to ensure the<br>
ingredients are well 
blended, and the batter smooth. If using chocolate chips, fold in<br>
chips.<br>
<br>Fill the the pans about 3/4 full. Bake for 18-20 minutes, or until a cake 
tester inserted in<br>
the center comes out clean. <br>
<br>
Cool in the tins 
for 10 minutes, then on wire racks until completely cool.<br>
<br>
For layer 
cakes, divide the batter between 2 9-in. round cake pans and bake 30&ndash;40 
minutes.<br>
<br>
<br>
CHOCOLATE BUTTERCREAM <br>
5oz (140g) dark chocolate, 
roughly chopped<br>
1/2 cup (115g) butter, softened<br>
1-1/2 (195g)cup 
confectioners&rsquo; sugar<br>
1/2 tsp. vanilla extract<br>
<br>
Melt chocolate 
over hot water; stir until smooth. Let cool 15 minutes. In large bowl, beat 
butter until light. Slowly add confectioners&rsquo; sugar, and beat until 
completely combined. Stir in melted chocolate and vanilla; beat until smooth.
<br><br>
Pour into a piping bag and chill for 20 minutes. Pipe onto cupcakes 
just before serving.</p>

<h1>Mid-East meets Mid-Pac: Kajiki with Pomegranate-Ogo (Sea grass)</h1>  
March13 2008 <br>
<br>
Once we had discovered the delightful marriage of 
pomegranate and fish in the Salmon in Pomegranate Sauce , we wondered how the 
pairing would work with other fish. We had more fillets in the fridge to play 
with &mdash; this time firm white-fleshed Kajiki, or Pacific blue marlin. 
Rather than marinate the fish, I seasoned it shortly before cooking with some 
of the Middle Eastern flavors we usually associated with pomegranate &mdash;  
namely cumin and coriander. I then used the base ingredients for the marinade 
to make a sauce and a dressing instead. <br>
<br>
<br>
The key flavor 
ingredient here, pomegranate molasses, is an intensely fruitful and tart syrup 
with the dense viscosity of, well . . . molasses. Used primarily in savory 
dishes in Persian and Turkish cuisines, it's finding greater uses in Western 
kitchens with the rise in popularity and availability of all things 
pomegranate. On Oahu, your best source for pomegranate molasses is India 
Market, near the University. Elsewhere, check a Turkish or Middle Eastern dry 
goods store, or your local health food store. <br>
<br>
Sea grasses of all 
kinds, including the limu ogo we use here, are ubiquitous in Hawaii. You find 
it in salads, soups, pokes (POH-kays), and as a raw ingredient by the bagful in 
many supermarkets. Among the diverse Asian population here, consuming sea grass 
is par for the course. US and other Western populations are also discovering 
sea grasses, lured by their &quot;superfood&quot; status for their high 
nutritional and mineral content, and low calorie load. I hope we begin to see 
sea grasses also more widely available and utilized in innovative ways. We had 
a bag of fresh ogo on hand, so I wanted to include that in this presentation. 
We actually made this meal when my dad was visiting last month, and sea grasses 
were one of the top foods in the list of low-purine foods for his 
gout-management diet.<br>
<br>
Fresh ogo appears dark brown or reddish-brown 
(photo at left), when raw. After blanching, it turns a bright forest green. 
Although blanching is not necessary when using ogo as a salad or with other 
seafood preparations, since we were pairing it with some non-traditional 
flavors I wanted to reduce its normal brininess just a tad. The brief hot 
shower did no damage to the ogo's pleasing crunch &mdash;  a surprising 
contrast to the firm texture of the fish. The pomegranate and ogo complimented 
each other well &mdash;  the sea grass absorbed the punchy, mineral flavors of 
the pomegranate and Manuka honey and delivered them intact to the fish. We will 
try this combination again.<br>
<br>
KAJIKI WITH POMEGRANATE-OGO<br>
For the 
Fish:<br>
2 4 oz. (120g) skinless fillets of kajiki, ahi, or other firm-fleshed 
fish<br>
1/2 tsp. cumin powder<br>
1/2 tsp. coriander powder<br>
ground black 
pepper<br>
sea salt<br>
<br>
Combine cumin and coriander powders, and gently 
massage or rub into fish. Set aside for at least 30 minutes.<br>
<br>
For the 
Ogo:<br>
Take one large fist-ful of raw ogo and place in colander. Rinse well. 
Bring 4 cups of water to a hard boil, then pour over ogo in colander. Shake and 
drain well, then rinse with cold water. Leave to dry while you prepare the 
dressing.<br>
<br>
For the Sauce and Dressing:<br>
(adapted from Laurie's 
Mediterranean Cooking in Alaska )<br>
4 cloves garlic, minced<br>
olive oil<br>

1/4 cup  dry white wine<br>
1/2 tsp. coriander powder<br>
1/2 tsp. Aleppo pepper
<br>1-1/2 TBL.  pomegranate molasses<br>
1-1/2 TBL.  Manuka or other 
non-flowery honey (raw honey, if watching your gout)<br>
sea salt, to taste<br>

<br>1 TBL.  red wine or raspberry vinegar<br>
1-2 TBL. olive oil<br>
sea salt, 
to taste <br>
<br>
In a small saucepan set over low heat, sweat garlic in oil 
until softened, about 5-7 minutes. Add wine, and turn heat up to medium-high. 
Add coriander and pepper, and cook until spices are fragrant and alcohol has 
burned off, about 1 minute. Add molasses, honey and sea salt, and stir through. 
Cook together for about 1 minute.<br>
<br>
Remove 2 TBL. of sauce to a small 
mixing bowl and whisk in vinegar and oil. Taste and correct for salt. Using 
kitchen shears, cut ogo into 2-inch pieces. Add to dressing and mix well. Set 
aside.<br>
<br>
Heat skillet with 2 TBL. oil over high heat. Salt fish fillets, 
then immediately add to pan, salted side down. When fillets release from pan, 
turn them over and reduce heat to medium. Cook until flesh will flake with a 
fork (or until desired doneness &mdash;  if using ahi or wahoo, some people may 
prefer to leave the center sashimi-esque, like the Ahi with Peppercorns ). <br>

<br>For service, spoon a pool of sauce on the plate and place a fillet in the 
center. Top with the dressed ogo, and serve with smashed potatoes and roasted 
broccoli.<br>
<br>
For a gout-management diet, be certain to use skinless 
fillets and raw honey for the fish, and serve with whole roasted or smashed 
potatoes (i.e., with the skin on). This will be included in the GDC round-up .

<h1>Salmon with Pomegranate Sauce</h1>  March11 2008 <br>
<br>
Catching up 
with some past dinners that have not been shared, this sweet and savory salmon 
inspiration came from dear Laurie at Mediterranean Cooking in Alaska . As I 
contemplated the multitude of seasonings and spices I have to use or lose soon, 
a lone bottle of pomegranate molasses kept calling from the dark recesses of 
the pantry. An ingredient I had always associated with Persian cooking, 
pomegranate molasses is a bright and sensuous syrup that evokes the exotic. We 
had only paired the deep, rich flavor of pomegranate with duck and lamb before, 
but the assertive flavor of salmon promised to be a fruitful match as well.<br>

<br> Laurie's recipe  called for the salmon to be marinated for a couple of 
hours with pomegranate molasses, garlic, honey, Aleppo peppers and wine, then 
pan-fried and served with the pomegranate reduction. Here wild sockeye salmon 
fillets with pomegranate sauce are served with cinnamon couscous and stewed 
beans. We loved the marriage of pomegranate and salmon, and would definitely 
pair these again. I wondered, though, if the reduction alone (sans marination) 
would be enough to top other firm-fleshed fish. Since we only used half the 
marinade base (molasses, garlic and honey) for the salmon, the other half we 
paired the next day with a fish more often found in these warmer waters &mdash; 
 Kajiki, aka Pacific blue marlin. And limu. Stay tuned.

<h1>Brunch fit for a queen: Eggs a la reine</h1>  March08 2008  UPDATE: Find 
the round-up for the IWD in 2 parts at zorra's sitehere, and at fiordisale's 
site here . <br>
<br>

<p><br>
</p> 
<p>Today is the international day to celebrate women. In honor of this joyous 
day,fiordisale and zorra have joined their considerable energies to organize a 
cyber-celebration ofInternational Women's Day 2008. Invitees to the potluck 
were asked to prepare something yellow to share. I've been contemplating the 
makings of a savory waffle dish for a few weeks now, so I combined two of my 
favorite flavors (they just happen to also be yellow), saffron and lemon, to 
create a new take on a brunch favorite. This Belgian-style waffle is topped 
with seared oyster mushrooms, eggs, and a saffron-lemon sauce, and christened 
to celebrate the queen that dwells in every woman. Move over, Eggs Benedict, 
Eggs a la reine are in the house.<br>
<br>
I wish each woman today, a day 
filled with love and family, and yes, wonderful flavors!<br>
<br>
<br>
EGGS A

<h1>A Sponge for Flavor: The Bottlegourd or Upo</h1>  March05 2008 <br>
<br>

This spicy, easy recipe with new flavors came to us last week on a visit to 
Sagari's Indian Cooking  website. She combines quick-cooking mung beans (no 
soaking needed) and a ridge gourd with spices to produce a memorable one-dish 
meal. Served with rotis or other flatbread (we had whole wheat tortillas), this 
simple dal is great cool weather comfort food and a nice change of pace from 
soup. I usually use mung beans to make a Filipino soup with pork, greens and 
fish sauce, so this was a nice alternative to our old stand-by.<br>
<br>
We 
didn't have ridge gourd, but had picked up a nice young bottle gourd, or <em>upo
</em> , over the weekend. When choosing a gourd, I look for something heavy for 
its size as older gourds begin to lose water and become fibrous. So fibrous, in 
fact, that when fully dried they become a bath sponge, the loofah (derived from 
its Latin genus <em>Luffa</em> ). My mom used to supply me with bath loofahs 
from her backyard garden on Guam when the occasional one escaped her notice 
until past its edible prime. Upo and other gourds of its ilk are mildly sweet 
on their own, but readily absorb flavors from their cooking medium. Usually I 
use upo in soups like Chicken Tinola  or even a regular chicken soup, in place 
of zucchini or other squash. With the mung beans in this dish, it added a nice 
textural element to the soupy dal.<br>
<br>
<br>
Sagari's recipe  is made using 
a pressure cooker, so I've adapted it here to cook in a regular saucepan.<br>

<br>MUNG BEAN &amp; UPO STEW<br>
(adapted from <em>Indian Cooking</em> )<br>
4 
tbs oil<br>
4 garlic cloves, minced<br>
1 medium onion, finely diced<br>
1 tsp. 
cumin seeds<br>
1 tsp. musturd seeds<br>
1 tsp chilli powder<br>
1/2 tsp. 
turmeric powder<br>
1 tsp. coriander powder<br>
1/2 cup tomato ( chopped)<br>
2 
TBL. cilantro<br>
2 dry red chilies<br>
3/4 cup dried mung beans, rinsed well
<br>1 medium upo (about 1.5 lb total weight), seeded and cut into 1-inch cubes 
(peeling is optional for smaller gourds)<br>
1.5 tsp. salt<br>
2 cups water<br>

<br>Preheat 3-quart or larger saucepan over medium high heat, then add oil, 
cumin and mustard seeds and chilies. When seeds begin to pop, immediately add 
onions and garlic and cook until onions are translucent. Add turmeric, 
coriander, chili powder, and cook for about 1 minute. Add tomato and cilantro 
leaves, and whole chilies and cook until tomatoes soften.<br>
<br>
Add mung 
beans, upo, salt and water, and cover. Cook over medium-low heat for 30-40 
minutes, or until beans are soft and thicken broth.<br>
<br>
Garnish with 
cilantro, and serve with flatbreads. This will thicken as it sits and cools, 
and was equally delicious the next day cold, topping thick sliced toast. Thanks 
to Sagari for a new way to look at mung beans and gourds!<br>

<h1>Go Home, Cook Rice: Miso Butterfish</h1>  March03 2008 <br>
<br>
One of 
the hundreds of great things about living in Hawaii is the access to simple and 
quick healthy meals that only require a pot of home-cooked hot rice and a few 
minutes of skillet time. Misoyaki Butterfish fillets are available in almost 
every grocery, pre-marinated in a boozy miso-laced sake marinade that permeates 
the flaky silken butterfish, aka black cod or sablefish. Served with deli-made 
sea salad (sesame sea grass) or marinated warabi (fiddlehead) greens , as 
pictured above, misoyaki butterfish brings fine dining home. (The fish above 
and below were from purchased, pre-marinated filets.)<br>
<br>
If you don't 
find pre-marinated butterfish filets at your local market, try this marinade at 
home. We've used this recipe before, and have stored it away for a day when we 
will not find marinated butterfish filets in the local markets. I gave the fish 
2 days marinating time, but 3 would have been better. Give yourself the full 3 
days marination for the most flavorful results. You can try this marinade with 
any flaky white fish, but if you can find sable fish or black cod, try it with 
this fish. There is a synergy that happens between the flavors in the marinade 
and the texture of butterfish that is infinitely greater than the sum of the 
parts.<br>
<br>
(Also check out rowena's take on Miso Monkfish  with a 
laulau-esque presentation alla Italia.)<br>
<br>
MISOYAKI BUTTERFISH<br>
4 
1/2lb. (220g) filets of butterfish (aka black cod or sablefish)<br>
1-1/2 cups 
(300ml) Japanese sake (rice wine)<br>
3/4 cups (150ml) mirin<br>
1-1/2 cups raw 
sugar<br>
2 cups (450g) white (aka shiro) miso<br>
<br>
Combine sake, mirin and 
sugar and bring just to a boil over high heat. Immediately turn heat down to 
medium and stir well to dissolve sugar. Add miso paste, and incorporate 
completely. Cook for 10 minutes, then remove from heat and cool completely.<br>

<br> <br>
Pat filets dry, then cover with marinade, seal well and refrigerate 
for 3 days.<br>
<br>
When ready to cook, preheat a small pan in the oven at 
350F/180C. (A small tabletop oven or toaster oven is perfect for this.) <br>

<br> Pre-heat your pan, and add 2 TBL. olive oil. You can pat filets with paper 
toweling, but don't rinse with water. Place the skinless side down first, and 
gently (very gently) press to make contact with the pan. After a full minute or 
so, the glaze should release from the pan (i.e., not stick), and you can turn 
it to the other side for browning. After 30 seconds, put the filets on the 
pre-heated pan in the oven and bake for 10-12 minutes, or until the fish flakes 
with a fork. Serve with rice, sesame-laced vegetables (see Warabi  or Watercress
 recipes) or sea salad, and Namasu . <br>

<h1>Confetti Potato Salad </h1>  February28 2008 <br>
<br>
When we found a 
package of mixed new potatoes in the market, I couldn't pass up the chance to 
play with the lively colors for the Potato Fe(a)st Event  at DK's Culinary 
Bazaar . <br>
Although my first instinct with new potatoes is always to roast 
them, I knew from past experience that roasting, while intensifying the flavor, 
dulled the vibrant colors. <br>
<br>
(Raw and steamed Okinawan purple sweet and 
Peruvian purple new potatoes)<br>
<br>
Steaming would preserve the color and 
keep them firm, but they would require some strong flavors to punch through 
that waxy texture. Since T has never been a fan of mayonnaise-based salads, I'm 
always keen to try any potato salad without mayo. The sharp mix of lemon and 
feta in this recipe seemed the perfect foil for the bland potatoes, but the 
original called for kalamata olives, which we didn't have. I've substituted 
capers for the olives, and so hesitate to call this Moldavian Potato Salad, 
which is what it was titled in the library book I borrowed. At any rate, I was 
happy with the rich colors and sassy flavor that comes through in the end.<br>

<br> This salad joins &quot; Purple &amp; Squeak ,&quot; made with the Okinawan 
sweets, in going out to DK for her event celebrating the International Year of 
the Potato.<br>
<br>
CONFETTI POTATO SALAD<br>
(heavily adapted from <em>The 
Potato Cookbook</em> )<br>
<br>
For the potatoes:<br>
2.2 lb. (1kg) total of 
mixed red, Yukon gold, and Peruvian purple potatoes<br>
2 cloves garlic, finely 
minced<br>
2-4 TBL.  olive oil<br>
sea salt<br>
ground black pepper<br>
<br>

Wash potatoes well, including a soak in a solution of 1 TBL.  white vinegar for 
every 2 qt./liter clean water. Scrub, rinse and place whole, unpeeled potatoes 
in large steamer that can hold potatoes in single layer. Cook over medium high 
steam until potatoes are easily pierced with a knife blade. You might have to 
remove smaller potatoes earlier so they do not become water-logged.<br>
<br>

Combine minced garlic and oil. While potatoes are hot, cube them into 1/2-inch 
(1.5-2cm) cubes, place in large bowl, and dress with garlic oil. Season to 
taste with sea salt and ground black pepper. Allow to cool to room temperature.
<br> <br>
To finish salad:<br>
4 scallions (green onions), white and light 
green parts only (save the dark green for garnish), sliced thin<br>
1/2 cup 
feta, crumbled<br>
1/2 cup capers, rinsed and drained<br>
1 sprig of fresh dill 
(about 1/4 cup)<br>
Juice of 1 lemon<br>
<br>
When potatoes have cooled, add 
scallions, feta, capers, dill and lemon juice, and toss gently to combine. 
Taste and correct seasoning &mdash;  it should be lemony and salty-tart from 
the cheese and capers. Serve at room temperature. Can be chilled if made ahead, 
but allow to come to room temperature before serving. Garnish with reserved 
scallion greens, if desired.<br>
<br>
Plate alongside your favorite finger 
sandwiches or quiche for an elegant tea or brunch, or fried chicken for a 
picnic in the park. Also makes a terrific sandwich filling stuffed in a pita 
with tomatoes and cucumbers, or rolled in a tortilla wrap with a smear of 
hummus to bind (I didn't have hummus for the wrap seen here, but was wishing I 
did).<br>

<p><br>
</p> 
<p></p> <br>
By keeping the skins on the potatoes, this salad seems to fit the 
criteria for dad's gout management diet, so it will be included in theGout Diet 
Challenge round-up  for him.

<h1>&quot;Bubble &amp; Squeak&quot; tweaked . . .</h1>  February26 2008 <br>

<br> When I received DK's invitation to participate in her first sponsored 
event at DK's Culinary Bazaar  celebrating the year of the potato, I thought 
this might be the time to try something that's been lurking in the back of my 
mind for some time. I've always loved the combination of potatoes and cabbage, 
whether it's as Haluschka (potatoes, cabbage, onion and caraway) or the 
delightfully named Bubble &amp; Squeak (mashed potatoes and cooked cabbage). 
And it's the latter that has been tickling my imagination for as long as we've 
had access to the gorgeous dark purple Okinawan sweet potatoes here in Hawaii 
&mdash;  what if you combined purple potatoes with purple (i.e., red) cabbage 
and red onions? You would have, of course, Purple &amp; Squeak (you can see in 
the photo that even the mustard seeds took on a red tinge after they popped, so 
as to blend with today's color scheme).<br>
<br>
Hawaii has a wondrous bounty 
of sweet potato varieties. At left, basketfuls of taro (upper left), russets, 
and two varieties of Okinawan sweet potatoes crowd a display at Kekaulike Mall 
in Chinatown. At right, 3 varieties of sweet potato (US, top left; Okinawan 
white, bottom right; and Okinawan purple) and 1 yam (bottom left). The Okinawan 
varieties have a firmer flesh than the US regular sweet potato.<br>
<br>
In 
Britain, Bubble &amp; Squeak is a dish designed to make-over mashed potatoes 
and cabbage left from the previous day's Sunday roast; in this case we had 
leftover Mashed Sweet Potatoes with Awamori  (but without the evaporated milk 
called for in that recipe) and I cooked the red cabbage to make this dish. 
Given the natural sweetness of the Okinawan purple sweet potato, and the added 
sweetness of cooked cabbage, I wanted to balance those with a little heat and 
spice in the form of popped mustard seeds, cumin, chaat masala and a chopped 
jalapeno (seeded). We enjoyed this dish very much, and will make it again. We 
had it first with grilled fish and couscous, but loved it even more simply 
wrapped in a warm whole wheat tortilla with cilantro sprigs tucked in the 
middle.<br>
<br>
DK's Potato Fe(a)st  is open until Feb. 29th. If you enjoy 
potatoes, both savory and sweet, as much as I do, check out her site to enter 
or to see the Round-up soon.<br>
<br>
PURPLE &amp; SQUEAK<br>
1 quantity of 
Mashed Sweet Potatoes with Awamori  (2 lbs. of sweet potatoes)<br>
<br>
2 TBL.  
olive oil<br>
1 TBL.  brown mustard seeds <br>
1 medium red onion, diced<br>
1 
serrano or jalapeno pepper, seeded and diced<br>
2 tsp. cumin powder<br>
1 
medium red cabbage (about 2 lbs/1kg), sliced lengthwise into 1-inch (2.5cm) 
wide slices<br>
sea salt <br>
1 tsp. chaat masala<br>
cilantro for garnish<br>

<br>Heat oil over medium high heat in large saute pan or wok. When hot, add 
mustard seeds and stir until they begin popping, then immediately add onion. 
Stir to coat onion, then cover pan and turn heat to low. Allow onions to cook 
until translucent, about 8-10 minutes. Remove cover and return heat to medium 
high. Move onions aside, creating a space in the middle of the pan, and add 
cumin powder to the center, stirring well to cook through for 1 minute. Add 
peppers, and saute for another 5 minutes. Add cabbage and 1 tsp. sea salt, mix 
well. Cover and cook until cabbage is tender, about 15 minutes.<br>
<br>
Stir 
in prepared Mashed Sweet Potatoes and mix well to combine. Cover and heat 
through completely. Sprinkle with chaat masala and garnish with minced 
cilantro. Serve with any grilled fish or meat. Or eat either rolled in or atop 
(like a pizza) your favorite homemade or purchased flatbread. You can also 
shape into patties and pan fry with olive oil &mdash;  the stickier texture of 
the sweet potato means no egg is required for binding &mdash;  for entree-type 
cutlets.<br>

<p><br>
</p> 
<p></p> <br>
Skinless potatoes should be eaten less frequently by those with 
gout conditions, although potatoes with skin are considered good for those on a 
gout management diet. I wouldn't imagine eating the purple sweet variety with 
its skin, since it tends to be a bit tough after cooking; although the Okinawan 
white-flesh sweet variety could be mashed with the skin.<br>
<br>
Cabbage is 
also high on the list of good foods for gout management. I would include this 
in dad's low-purine regimen by using a larger percentage of the cabbage mixture 
to sweet potato, and ensuring the other elements of the meal were especially 
low-purine, such as quinoa and lemon roasted chicken.

<h1>Persian-style Grilled Chicken</h1>  February25 2008 <br>
<br>
One of our 
favorite stand-bys for the grill is this lovely Persian style yogurt-marinated 
chicken. A friend shared her Iranian mother-in-law's recipe with us in broad 
strokes, giving general proportions of each ingredient for the marinade. After 
8 years of tossing this marinade together every few months, and borrowing a 
basting technique from well-known Persian chef Najmieh K. Batmanglij in her 
book, &quot;A Taste of Persia,&quot; I finally had to develop an actual recipe 
to share with other friends.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The yogurt serves to tenderize 
as well as flavor the chicken, leaving it moist and juicy even after high 
grilling. This marinade gets better the longer it has to marry with the 
chicken, up to 2 days in the coolest part of your refrigerator. Served with 
lavosh or other flat bread, grilled zucchini and tomatoes, and a yogurt salad, 
this is an exotic way to break out of the seeming confines of a low-purine diet 
(see the Gout Diet Challenge ) that my dad faces for the next 9 months or so. 
Basmati rice is another traditional accompaniment. <br>
<br>
<br>
As is sumac, 
a coarse dark burgundy colored powder made from the berries of a bush that 
grows wild in the Middle East and parts of Italy (related to, but not the same 
as, the poison sumac found in North America). It is an essential flavoring and 
souring agent in many Middle Eastern cuisines, including Persian. Here it is 
used as a condiment for the cooked chicken and rice. To be honest, I think I 
sometimes make this dish because I'm really craving the combination of yogurt, 
rice and sumac that are essential components of this meal. On Oahu, I finally 
located a local source for sumac &mdash;  India Market on South Beretania, near 
University Ave. (right where King St. becomes a one-way road), has many Middle 
Eastern pickles and spices, as well as Indian foods, clothing, music and movies.
<br><br>
PERSIAN-STYLE GRILLED CHICKEN<br>
Marinade:<br>
1/4 cup (30g) plain 
full-fat yogurt<br>
1/2 cup olive oil<br>
4-6 cloves garlic, minced<br>
Juice 
from 1 lemon (about 1/4 cup, 60ml)<br>
2 tsp. cumin powder<br>
1/2 tsp. saffron 
threads, soaked in 2 TBL. water (optional) <br>
sea salt<br>
ground black pepper
<br><br>
1 whole chicken, backbone removed, quartered, and wing tips removed<br>
1 lime, quartered<br>
<br>
Combine marinade ingredients in glass bowl or zipper 
bag. Add chicken, and combine well, massaging marinade under skin and into 
joints. Cover or zip up, and let marinate at least 8 hours, and up to 3 days.
<br><br>
To prepare to grill, remove chicken from refrigerator about 30 minutes 
before it is set to go on the grill (i.e., while the grill is pre-heatting or 
the charcoal coming up to cooking temperature). Make basting sauce.<br>
<br>

Basting Sauce:<br>
Juice of 1 lime (about 2 tsp.)<br>
3 TBL. . unsalted butter, 
melted<br>
sea salt<br>
ground black pepper<br>
<br>
Combine ingredients and 
blend well to dissolve salt.<br>
<br>
Remove chicken from marinade and discard 
marinade. Place chicken on grill, skin-side down first. Turn over and baste 
liberally. Grill until each piece runs clear when cut near the joint, basting 
each time the chicken is turned. Remove fully cooked chicken from grill, and 
immediately squeeze lime juice over.<br>
<br>
Serve with lavosh, basmati rice, 
grilled vegetables, yogurt salad, and liberally sprinkled with sumac.<br>
<br>

Note on cutting chicken for serving: In the U.S., we generally cut a 
half-breast at the joint between breast and wing, leaving a tasty but tiny wing 
piece and a rather over-sized breast portion. Here's a more equitable cut 
&mdash;  cut through the lower third of the breast so some white meat goest 
with the wing, and further divide the remaining part in two. This will allow 
more diners to get a share of white meat, if they like, and it encourages 
portion control as well.<br>

<h1>If you are what you eat . . . </h1>  February21 2008 <br>
 . . . better 
know what you're eating, yeah?!<br>
<br>
One of the trickiest issues I've come 
across while researching the management of a gout-friendly kitchen is the lack 
of resources when it comes to the nutritional values of less common Asian 
vegetables and fruits, and prepared ethnic foods. While some, like konnyaku and 
kelp (kombu) have made in-roads into the US and other Western markets as health 
foods, many others remain on the fringe. One resource I've found is not related 
to gout in particular, but is enlightening nonetheless about the nutrition 
content of foods common in Hawaii.<br>
<br>
The &quot; Hawai'i Foods: Nutrition 
with Aloha &quot; website, sponsored by the College of Tropical Agriculture and 
Human Resources (CTAHR) at the University of Hawaii, provides a breakdown of 
the total calories, protein, carbohydrate, fat, cholesterol, and vitamin &amp; 
mineral content of popular fruits, vegetables, and cooked foods in the Islands. 
One recipe that was featured earlier here on ThreeTastes, Chicken and Green 
Papaya Soup (Chicken Tinola) , is one of the cooked dishes listed on the site: 
a 1-cup serving of Chicken Tinola has 97 calories, 7g of protein, 4g of 
carbohydrates, 1g of fiber, 6g of total fat (only 1g is saturated), 23mg 
cholesterol, as well as Vitamins A &amp; C, niacin, folate, calcium, magnesium, 
zinc, potassium and phosphorus; and 363mg sodium. Pretty healthy, all things 
considered, and the sodium content can be controlled by the amount of fish 
sauce (patis) you add while cooking.<br>
<br>
Other dishes include ahi poke, 
kim chee, spam musubi, macaroni salad (included with almost every plate lunch 
in the Islands), char siu pork, chicken katsu, guinataan, pinakbet, mochi, 
laulau, kalua pork, poi, teriyaki beef, and chap chae. If you're familiar with 
these dishes, it's kind of fun &mdash;  and sometimes scary &mdash;  to see the 
actual nutritional breakdown of these foods. (I have to seriously re-think how 
much poke we eat . . . too sad)<br>
<br>
Also on the site are less common 
fruits and vegetables, such as apple banana, watercress, taro, string beans, 
Okinawan sweet potato, tamarind, soursop, mustard cabbage, mountain apple, 
papaya, marunggay leaves, lychee, jackfruit, guava, wing beans (listed 
as&quot;goa bean&quot;), bok choy, choi sum, and bittermelon.<br>
<br>
Another 
great asset is the Recipe page which features more modern recipes using local 
ingredients: Watercress &amp; Pork (saute), Pineapple Chicken, Apple Banana 
Bread, Daikon &amp; Potato Soup, Chicken Noodle Choi Sum, and Okinawan Sweet 
Potato Hash, among many others. The nutrition breakdown for each recipe is also 
provided. Go there , or click &quot;Discover&quot; on the main page. I'd like 
to sample some of these recipes for this site, so stay tuned.<br>
<br>
<br>

Also on the site is a tool called &quot;My Diet, or PacTrac (short for Pacific 
Tracker)&quot; which is supposed to allow the user to gauge the nutrition 
content of their actual diet. It allows you to enter the foods you've eaten in 
the last 24 hours and receive back a report on how healthy that one-day diet 
was. The first problem I encountered was that when I entered 
&quot;oatmeal&quot; as the first item, I was given a list of 6 dry or instant 
oatmeal cereals to choose from, but no cooked oatmeals, so I could not proceed. 
It's a great idea, but it may need a little more work on that score. To see 
PacTrac for yourself, go there  now, or click &quot;Learn&quot; on the 
&quot;Hawai'i Foods&quot; main page.<br>
<br>
Finally, you can access and 
download (as PDF files) quite a few different UH publications that look at the 
history and nutrition of local foods, as well as guides on how to choose a more 
healthy diet among foods available locally ( Go there ). One guide in 
particular seemed very practical and helpful: Hawaiian Food Choices for 
Healthful Living . This 39-page booklet breaks down the US government's 
recommended foods pyramid (Starch, Calcium/Milk, Fruit, Vegetable, Meat, and 
Fat), and includes local foods in each food group, including saloon crackers, 
arare (listed as mochi crunch), coconut, soba noodles, ramen, breadfruit, lotus 
root, pigeon peas, lychee, poha berries, ume, parrotfish (ulu), milkfish 
(bangus), skipjack tuna (aku), fish sauce, and Tabasco.<br>
<br>
<br>
However, 
my favorite sections begin at page 28 (to page 33) of the booklet: these 
sections detail how some local favorites make up the total servings from each 
of the food groups the USDA recommends (2 servings of Calcium/Milk, 3 
Vegetables, 4 Fruit, 8 Starch, 5 Meat, 4 Fat). For example, 1 cup of Portuguese 
Bean Soup  (see photo) provides 1/2 of one Vegetable serving, and 2 Meat; 1/2 
cup of Halo-Halo (Filipino mixed fruit and ice dessert) has 1/2 Fruit serving, 
1 Starch, and 1 fat; and 1 cup of Bibimbap (Korean rice topped with vegetables 
and beef) has 1 Starch, 1-1/2 Vegetable, 1/2 Meat, 1/2 Fat. But ask yourself, 
do you really have only 1 cup of Portuguese Bean Soup or Bibimbap? Portion 
sizes in the Islands are very generous so calculate that in as well. I know my 
soup bowl probably holds about 2 cups of soup &mdash; and don't forget about 
the cornbread you might have on the side, too!<br>
<br>
The CTAHR at the 
University launched this site last year, and I've enjoyed using these tools and 
have learned a lot about the foods we eat here in Hawaii. I can't say we've 
banished anything from our table because of something we've learned on this site
&mdash; moderation is saner than total denial (especially when there are so 
many ono foods). But if knowledge is power, then the CTAHR has certainly 
empowered us to make intelligent choices about what we can enjoy in the Islands.
<br><br>
So &quot;Mahalo nui loa&quot; to all the researchers and staff at 
CTAHR who made this site possible!<br>
<br>

seafood and fish in Hawaii and around the world that are safe for both you and

<h1>The GDC: Five-Spices Chicken</h1>  February19 2008 <br>
<br>
We're still 
in the market for gout-friendly recipes that tickle the palate. This is one I 
actually dug up from my recipe files after dad reminisced about a Chinese-style 
chicken he remembered that was flavored with star-anise. I copied the original 
recipe from a newspaper article probably 20 years ago (yes, when I was a mere 
child in grade school . . .) onto a 4x6 index card. It's quite westernized, but 
still answers to its original Asian influences. I've adapted the old recipe so 
it is friendlier to the gout sufferer and can be cooked wholly in a slow-cooker 
for 6 hours, though the sauce must be finished in a pan. It's a recipe designed 
to leaves the chef free for a day to pursue other interests. Note how the 
chicken browned nicely even without the pre-browning step.<br>
<br>
Even if you 
don't have gout, this is an easy and delicious way to add a little something 
different to your weekday menu. Follow the suggestions for non-restricted diets 
in parentheses.<br>
<br>
FIVE SPICES CHICKEN<br>
Sauce:<br>
2 TBL. tomato paste 
(or ketchup, as in the original recipe!)<br>
1/4 cup raw honey (better for gout 
diet), OR 3 TBL. brown sugar<br>
1/4 cup low-sodium soy sauce (or regular if 
you have no restrictions for gout)<br>
1/4 cup natural apple juice (sake, 
sherry, or Chinese rice wine if you have no restrictions for gout)<br>
1/4 cup 
broth or water (if using only whole breasts, I recommend using broth, as the 
breast pieces don't have enough bones to substantially flavor the sauce) + more 
to cover the chicken pieces in the pot<br>
<br>
Combine ketchup, honey, soy 
sauce, juice/wine, and 1/4 cup broth/water and stir well to dissolve honey or 
sugar.<br>
<br>
1 onion, sliced<br>
3-6 cloves garlic, chopped<br>
2 4-in. 
(20cm) slices of fresh ginger<br>
1 stick of cinnamon, halved<br>
3-4 pieces of 
whole star anise<br>
6-10 whole black peppercorns<br>
1 whole frying chicken, 
or whole legs or breasts (3-4lbs, 1.5-2kg)<br>
<br>
To Finish:<br>
2 heaping 
TBL.  of cornstarch<br>
3 TBL. water<br>
<br>
Stir together to dissolve 
cornstarch. <br>
<br>
Lay onion, garlic, ginger, cinnamon, star anise, and 
peppercorns on bottom of slow-cooker. Cut chicken into serving size pieces, and 
lay on top of spices. Add prepared Sauce, and enough additional broth/water to 
cover the chicken. Set slow-cooker on LOW setting and leave to enjoy the rest 
of your morning.<br>
<br>
After 6-7 hours, remove chicken to serving dish and 
cover to keep warm. Strain remaining sauce into a skillet and boil over high 
heat to reduce to about 1.5 cups. Taste and if the flavor is not too 
concentrated, further reduce to 1 cup. If flavors are already strong, proceed 
to thickening.<br>
<br>
Taste and correct seasoning. To thicken, reduce heat to 
medium and add cornstarch mixture, stirring well as you pour in cornstarch. 
Stir well to combine and cook until sauce is slightly thickened and takes on a 
shine. Pour over chicken and serve immediately with Mestizo Rice , and steamed 
or braised vegetables (see GDC Round-up  for other gout-friendly recipes)<br>

<br>This recipe is going out to Sunita at Sunita's World . . . life and food  
for her wonderful &quot; Think Spice . . . think star anise &quot; event this 
month. I love the distinctive flavor of star anise, it is the signature spice 
in Five Spices Chicken, and I'm looking forward to Sunita's round-up at the 
beginning of March to discover new recipes featuring this pretty spice.<br>

<h1>Spice up your Valentine's: Vindaloo Curry Sauce</h1>  February14 2008 <br>

<br> I grew up eating curry on a regular basis. In truth, it was &ldquo;Curry 
Rice&rdquo; &mdash;  a Japanese adaptation of a Western (I&rsquo;m guessing 
British) version of Indian-style curries. I don&rsquo;t think you could get 
more attenuated from the original source than this. If you&rsquo;ve never had 
Japanese curry rice, it&rsquo;s kind of hard to describe because it bears 
little resemblance to the august culinary heritage from which it was adopted. 
There is something distinctly Japanese about it, which I can&rsquo;t quite put 
my finger on. You make curry rice by cooking together meat (if using) and 
vegetables in a broth or water, then adding this block of pre-mixed paste to 
season and create a thick gravy. But for the first 20-some odd years of my 
life, when I heard the word &ldquo;curry,&rdquo; this is what I saw in my head:
<br> <br>
It never occurred to me that curry rice was something one could make 
from scratch because the secret blend of spices in the commercial mix seemed 
too perfect and too obtuse to mess with. I&rsquo;ve looked at websites with 
Japanese-style curry rice recipes, but none have quite fit the bill. I&rsquo;m 
still looking.<br>
<br>
On a trip back from college one year, the Guam Hilton 
sponsored a curry festival in one of their restaurants and brought in an Indian 
chef from Singapore to create a dozen different types of curries. The most 
revelatory aspect of this event was that each curry (lamb, fish, chicken, duck, 
vegetable) had a different sauce! I know that sounds absurd now, but at the 
time the only difference in curries I had known was mild, medium or hot 
spiciness in curry rice (you could add different ingredients, but the sauce 
itself was the same)! I can&rsquo;t stress how much this first visit (we went 
back 3-4 more times while the event was going on) opened my eyes to the vast 
and varied world of Indian cuisine and started a continuing love-affair with 
all its many forms.<br>
<br>
So I could not pass up the chance to share in 
zorra&rsquo;s enthusiasm for spice and curries in her Curry Event  at 1x 
umr&uuml;hren bitte  (click here  or in the banner), by bringing one of our 
favorite curries, Vindaloo, out from the recipe pages into a post.<br>
<br>

Vindaloo is itself a blend of cultures, the influence of Portuguese settlers on 
India&rsquo;s west coast region of Goa. Vindaloo&rsquo;s Portuguese heritage is 
betrayed in its inclusion of vinegar and its copious use of garlic in the 
sauce. This sauce is best with red meats and fowl (such as duck); we make it 
most often with lamb.<br>
<br>
If 1lb. of meat seems like a small amount, 
that&rsquo;s because a meat curry is usually only one of several dishes in a 
typical Indian dinner (the others are usually legume stews (dals), vegetables, 
pickles and salads). A very healthy way to dine!<br>
<br>
(But I still love 
curry rice! And it's a favored stand-by and comfort food in our home, gracing 
our table at least once a month. With the block-o-paste seasoning it&rsquo;s a 
great weekday shortcut to a delicious hot meal in 30 minutes or less.)<br>
<br>

<br> VINDALOO CURRY SAUCE<br>
(serving for 4 persons as part of a full Indian 
dinner)<br>
<br>
1 lb. of boneless meat (pork, lamb, beef duck, or chicken) cut 
into large cubes<br>
1 piece of tamarind pulp, about the size of a walnut 
soaked in 2 cups (500ml) warm water for 30 minutes<br>
ghee or unsalted butter
<br>1 small onion, thinly sliced<br>
1 knob of ginger, peeled and julienned<br>

5-7 cloves garlic, minced<br>
4-10 dried red chillies<br>
1 tsp cumin seeds 1 
tsp black peppercorns 1&frac12; tsp whole cloves 1 cinnamon stick 1 TBL. brown 
sugar &frac14; cup (175ml) apple cider vinegar<br>
<br>
Gently fry onions in a 
medium saute pan about 5 minutes over low heat. Turn heat up to medium, and add 
ginger, garlic, cumin seeds and peppers and continue cooking until onions are 
translucent, about another 5 minutes. Add cloves, peppercorns, cinnamon, brown 
sugar and cinnamon stick. Cook another 10 minutes.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, press 
tamarind mixture through sieve and extract as much liquid as possible. Add 
tamarind juice to sauce, and cook another 10 minutes. Taste &mdash; it should 
be tart and lightly sweet and hot (peppery). Can be cooled and stored in fridge 
until needed.<br>
<br>
When ready to add meat, remove cinnamon stick and puree 
sauce in blender or with hand/stick blender.<br>
<br>
Season meat with salt and 
pepper, and brown well in separate pan. Add &frac12; cup (125 ml) water to 
deglaze pan used to brown meat. Return meat and curry to pan, and cook 20-35 
minutes uncovered, or until meat is tender.<br>
Serve with basmati rice, dal 
and Indian vegetables. (See recipes for Tarka Dal, Brussels Sprouts or Cabbage 
with Coconut, Chaat Potatoes, Aloo Gobi )<br>

<h1>Wahoo!: Valentine for a Special Couple</h1>  February13 2008 <br>
<br>

Today I wanted to make a special dinner for two people who aren't actually here 
in Hawaii, but who live in our hearts and thoughts everyday. We've begged, 
pleaded and cajoled them to visit here from cold and snowy (especially right 
now!!) Maine, but alas, to no avail. I'm sure they find the usual recipes on 
these pages a bit odd, and maybe even downright strange, and that's okay 
because they love me anyway. But today I wanted to send them a Valentine's wish 
for a very special anniversary.<br>
<br>
I looked for a Maine version of this 
recipe, certain that it would be a staple there. But of the 6 Maine cookbooks I 
consulted, not one had a recipe for Fish Pie. I found that a bit astonishing, 
to be honest, because this dish has so many things for New Englanders to love: 
sweet white-meat fish, mashed potatoes, and a light cream sauce. T describes it 
as a Maine-style fish stew with mashed potatoes on top. For those of you 
familiar with Shepherd's Pie, or Cumberland Pie, you can think of this as a 
marine version of that, too.<br>
<br>
I&rsquo;ve had to rely instead on the 
recipe we used, and on which we were tested on so often, at the Leith&rsquo;s 
School. I&rsquo;ve adapted the methods a bit (sorry, Claire, I haven&rsquo;t 
mashed potatoes through a sieve since 2000!), but the recipe is tried and true. 
One thing I like about this recipe is its method of poaching the fish in 
seasoned milk. The onion and bay leaf help to cut down any fishy smell, and in 
turn the poaching adds flavor to the milk, which is then used to make the 
bechamel sauce that will bathe the fish in creamy goodness. This was made with 
Wahoo, a popuar local fish also known as Ono (and it IS ono, too), and corn. 
It&rsquo;s one of T&rsquo;s favorites, too, so he gets a second early 
Valentine&rsquo;s dinner &mdash; he&rsquo;ll eat some for you both, Mom and Dad!
<br><br>
For Steve and Gladys, this one's for you! Thank you for all your love 
and support, and for sharing yourselves and one of the most wonderful of guys 
in the world with me. Happy Anniversary, late but with all our love!<br>

<p><br>
<br>
</p> 
<p>*** This recipe is joining the heart-shaped savory pies we made earlier for 
zorra&rsquo;s &ldquo;Heart for your Valentine&rdquo; event at 1x umr&uuml;hren 
bitte. The event closes on Friday, the 15th, but zorra is updating the round-up 
as entries come in, so if you want ideas to tickle your Valentine&rsquo;s 
fancy, there are already dozens of entries on-line. Check out the round-uphere

<br>
WAHOO (FISH) 
PIE<br>
(adapted from <em>The Leith's Cookery Bible</em> )<br>
Mis en place:<br>
1. Mashed Potatoes (for topping) (or use your favorite recipe)<br>
1.5 lb 
(675g) floury potato (e.g., Russett)<br>
sea salt and fresh ground pepper<br>

1/3 cup + 2 TBL.  (100 ml) milk, room temperature <br>
4 TBL.  (55g) butter, 
room temperature<br>
pinch fresh nutmeg (about 3 passes on a grater)<br>
<br>

Peel potatoes, cut in quarters, and place in steamer. Steam over medium-high 
steam for 15-20 minutes, or until cooked through.<br>
<br>
Place milk, butter, 
salt and pepper in large bowl. Transfer hot potatoes to bowl, season with salt 
and peper, and immediately mash or whip to fulffy consistency. Add nutmeg, if 
using, and stir to mix through.<br>
(Actually, when I make mashed potatoes for 
fish pie, I usually just mash the potatoes with a bit of sea salt and ground 
black pepper and a drizzle of olive oil because there is so much butter, milk 
and cream in the sauce, it is too rich for my blood. But for company or a 
special occasion, I'll splurge on the butter and milk in the potatoes too.) <br>
<br> 2. Poach Fish: <br>
1.5-2lb. (675-900g) haddock, cod, wahoo, mahimahi, or 
other firm white fish, with skin<br>
1-3/4 cup (425ml) whole or low-fat milk 
(don't recommend using non-fat)<br>
&frac12; onion, sliced<br>
8-10 peppercorns
<br>3-4 small bay leaves<br>
sea salt and fresh ground pepper<br>
<br>
Pre-heat 
oven to 350F/180C.<br>
<br>
In small oven-proof pan with deep sides, lay onion 
slices, peppercorns and bay leaves in pan. Place fish, skin side up (this is 
supposed to further protect your fish from drying out) on top of onions. Pour 
milk over fish, season with salt, and cover with parchment or wax paper. Cook 
in pre-heated oven for 15-20 minutes, or until fish is opaque (cooked through). 
Cooking time will depend on thickness of fish.<br>
<br>
Remove fish from pan, 
and keep covered to retain heat. Strain milk to remove solids, but KEEP MILK to 
make Bechamel Sauce.<br>
<br>
3. Make Bechamel Sauce: <br>
2 TBL. (30g) 
unsalted butter<br>
1/3 cup (30g) flour<br>
Reserved Milk from Poached Fish<br>

2 TBL. heavy cream (or double cream)<br>
<br>
Melt butter in saucepan, and 
immediately add flour. Stirring constantly, cook together for one minute. Add 2 
TBL. of Reserved Milk, and whisk until milk is completely absorbed. Add 2 more 
TBL. of Reserved Milk, and stir to incorporate. Continue to add increasing 
amounts of milk to slurry in pan, and whisk well. Bring sauce slowly to a boil 
over medium heat, then add cream and remove from heat. Taste, and season with 
salt and pepper.<br>
<br>
4. Assemble and Bake: <br>
5 large hard-boiled eggs, 
peeled; OR 1 cup ( g) peas, green beans or veggie of your choice<br>
Small 
bunch of flat-leaf parsley, minced ( about 2 TBL.)<br>
<br>
Place 6-cup 
oven-proof casserole on baking sheet. Flake fish in large chunks into 
casserole. Add eggs, if using, or vegetables. Sprinkle with parsley. Pour hot 
sauce over all. (Can be cooled and refrigerated overnight up to this point, to 
top with potatoes and bake later. Lay wax or parchment paper directly on 
surface of sauce to prevent &quot;skin&quot; from forming.)<br>
<br>
<br>

Spread a layer of mashed potates over fish and, using a fork, make a 
traditional criss-cross pattern over the top (photo on left). Alternatively, 
pipe mashed potatoes in attractive pattern over fish (heart-shaped pan).<br>

<br>Drizzle with olive oil, and and place casserole on baking sheet into middle 
shelf in oven. Bake for 10 minutes, or until filling is hot throughout. Test 
filling with metal needle or skewer to make certain it is hot. If potatoes 
start to brown before filling is properly heated, cover lightly with 
foil/aluminium.<br>
<br>
If you're baking a pie that was begun 24 hours earlier 
and refriegerated: Cover with foil/aluminium and bake for 30 minutes. Test 
filling as outlined above. Remove foil and continue baking another 10 minutes 
or until potatoes lightly brown.<br>
<br>
Serve with salad, and a dry 
(Sauvignon Blanc or Pinot Gris) or mildly sweet (Riesling or White Zinfandel) 
white wine.<br>
<br>
(This recipe also complies with the GDC , so it shouldn't 
trouble my dad's gout. More gout-friendly recipes )

<h1>The GDC: Chicken, Green Beans &amp; Cherries in Tomato Sauce</h1>  
February12 2008 <br>
<br>
While looking for interesting ways to cope with dad's 
diet limitations (our Gout Diet Challenge, GDC) as he works to reduce the 
visible uric crystal deposits (called tophi) on his hands and knees, the 
flavors of the Mediterranean still resound most strongly. We took a cruise 
through the Greek Islands many years ago with my parents, stopping in ports 
only long enough for T and I to make a mad dash through any groceries and 
bakeries we could find while my parents and aunt took the ship-sponsored tours 
or hung out in harbor-side cafes. The cruise only emphasized how fruitless it 
was for us to take a big-ship cruise through these wondrous islands, since you 
spend no quality time on any island.<br>
<br>
It was long enough, however, to 
introduce us to new flavors. One that has remained a staple in our house since 
that cruise is Fassoulakia me Domates, Green Beans with Tomatoes. We found a 
small cafe at the harbor in Hydra and ordered some food to take back with us to 
the ship, and once on board, skipped the formal ship dinner to feast on our 
local finds. To be honest, I don't remember much about the other foods we 
ordered, there were stuffed vegetables, fish, lamb, etc., but the lovely stewed 
beans in tangy tomato sauce was something I had to duplicate when we returned 
home.<br>
<br>
At that time, I had one Greek cookbook, &quot;Greek Cooking for 
the Gods,&quot; by Eva Zane. It had come highly recommended by a friend who 
regularly cooked from it for her Greek boyfriend, and it was my stand-by for 
moussaka, spanakopita, and the Easter bread that I loved. The recipe for 
Fassoulakia me Domates in this book looked promising, but it did not include 
currants, which had been in the beans we tried from Hydra. I included currants 
in our first try, and it was a pretty close match. Since then, I've also used 
raisins, sultanas, even diced apricots, and loved the results; and even 
omitting dried fruit altogether is delicious.<br>
<br>
To adapt this recipe for 
the GDC, I used dried tart cherries (black tart cherries are recommended for 
gout management) instead of currants. And I added cooked chicken (chicken is 
better than turkey for gout-sufferers) meatballs to make it a one-dish meal. 
Without meat, it is an easy side dish for roasted or grilled meats, or a very 
filling vegetarian entree served with couscous or to stuff a baked potato. Or 
as a flatbread pizza topping (that's for bee and Jai)!<br>
(See the new  GDC 
Round-up  for more gout-friendly recipes)<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CHICKEN WITH GREEN 
BEANS &amp; CHERRIES IN TOMATO SAUCE<br>
(Inspired by the gorgeous island of 
Hydra and heavily adapted from &quot;Greek Cooking for the Gods&quot;)<br>
<br>

Chicken Meatballs<br>
1 lb. (450g) ground chicken<br>
1/2 medium onion, minced
<br>1 clove garlic<br>
1 large egg<br>
1 tsp. paprika<br>
2 tsp. oregano<br>
1 
tsp. cumin<br>
1/2 tsp. Aleppo pepper (optional)<br>
1 tsp. sea salt<br>
1 tsp. 
ground black pepper<br>
<br>
Combine all ingredients and shape into golf-ball 
sized rounds. Saute in pan lined with 1/2-inch oil until browned on all sides, 
or place on baking sheet, drizzle with olive oil, and bake in tabletop oven for 
20 minutes. Add hot to sauce, or cool completely and freeze to make ahead (add 
to sauce frozen after beans have simmered for 20 minutes, then cook for another 
40 minutes).<br>
<br>
** To use fresh chicken, use 1 lb. skinless, boneless 
chicken breast or thigh meat cut into 1-inch cubes. Combine paprika, cumin, 
peppers and salt (omit oregano) listed in Meatball recipe above, and coat diced 
chicken in dry mixture. Set aside 30 minutes, then add to Tomato Sauce below 
after beans have simmered for 20 minutes, then continue cooking for the 
remaining 40 minutes in the original recipe. <br>
<br>
Tomato Sauce<br>
4 TBL. 
olive oil<br>
1 medium onion, diced<br>
2 cloves garlic, minced<br>
1/4 cup 
dried cherries (or currants, raisins, sultanas)<br>
1 TBL. dried oregano<br>
1/2
tsp. dried thyme<br>
1 tsp. dried dill (optional) <br>
6 ripe tomatoes, or 1 
28oz. (780g) canned tomatoes, diced<br>
1/2 cup dry white wine, or chicken or 
vegetable broth<br>
1/2 bunch fresh Italian parsley (flat-leaf), about 1 cup 
chopped<br>
1 bay leaf<br>
1 lb. green beans<br>
<br>
<br>
In large saute pan 
set over low heat, sweat onions in olive oil until transparent (take your time, 
this will take 8-10 minutes at least). Add garlic and dried cherries, and cook 
until both are just softened. Add oregano, thyme and dill (if using), and mix 
through onion mixture and leave to cook about 2 minutes, or until herbs become 
fragrant.<br>
<br>
Turn heat up to medium high and immediately add tomatoes, 
wine/broth, parsley and bay leaf. (If you omit the dried fruit completely, add 
1/2 tsp. brown sugar to sauce.)  Partially cover, and leave to simmer 20 
minutes while you prepare beans.<br>
<br>
Wash and tip green beans to remove 
stringy spine. Leave whole or cut into 2-inch lengths, it's up to your own 
aesthetics and who you are cooking for. Add to tomato sauce, cover completely 
and let simmer over low heat for 30-40 minutes. Add cooked meatballs, cover and 
simmer another 30 minutes.<br>
<br>
Serve with couscous, quinoa or amaranth 
(the latter two are very beneficial for the management of gout), fresh pita or 
other flatbread, or Mestizo Rice . In the photo, it is plated with cinnamon 
couscous.

<h1>The Gout Diet Challenge: Greens &amp; Cheese Pie</h1>  February10 2008  
UPDATE: Visit the newGDC Round-up for other gout-friendly recipes <br>
<br>
<br>
<br> While my dad is still here recuperating comfortably from his cataract 
surgery, I'm challenged with cooking with the limitations of his chronic gout 
condition, which includes bans on red meats, turkey, cured meats, black tea, 
preserved meats, shellfish, yeast breads, cauliflower, coffee, chocolate, 
refined sugars, refined salts, certain legumes, small fatty fish (anchovies, 
sardines, herring), carbonated drinks, white vinegar, fish sauce, and fried 
foods; as well as limiting amounts of asparagus, and mushrooms. (Thankfully the 
pre-op restriction on garlic is no longer in place.) Dad was a bit depressed on 
learning about all these dietary restrictions because he's an inveterate 
improviser in the kitchen and he loves all kinds of foods. (Guess who inherited 
these traits?) I want to show him that these limits don't condemn him to a life 
of bland meals. On the contrary, it's often helpful to look to other cultures 
and cuisine to discover delicious new ways to incorporate the foods that 
support his management of gout. (See a complete list of foods to avoid and 
foods to help eliminate uric acid  at GoutCure.com)<br>
<br>
Just a brief word 
about gout (the condensed version of what I've learned in the last week). Gout 
is a form of arthritis distinguished by extremely high levels of uric acid in 
the blood that may cause sudden painful attacks in the joints. Uric acid is the 
metabloic by-product of purines, a naturally occurring substance in our body 
tissue and in some foods we eat. Normally uric acid is safely secreted out of 
the body by the kidneys, but if one's metabolism is impaired (by medications, 
age, or disease) or if one consumes a consistently high purine diet with little 
exercise and insufficient water intake, gout can take hold. Unfortunately, 
dad's condition has been poorly managed and has resulted in the formation of 
tophi, or deposits of uric acid crystals in the joints, which are particularly 
painful. Since he has been found to be allergic to the more aggressive 
pharmaceuticals to treat gout, proper diet management is his best resort now.
<br> <br>
<br>
So what foods assist in the management of this condition? Well, 
one of the best foods is Watercress &mdash;  always a favorite around here 
anyway (see Flash-cooked Watercress  post) &mdash;  and another is Amaranth. We 
sometimes see fresh amaranth at our favorite greengrocer, and we were in luck 
this week. At right is red amaranth, both raw and flash-cooked for the recipe 
below. Along with some watercress, and low-sodium cheeses (dairy also aids gout 
management) , the amaranth went in to a &quot;pie&quot; that is a variation one 
of our favorite stand-bys, Spanakopita. But I've recently learned that there is 
also a wild greens and cheese pie called Hortopita, which this will more 
closely resemble. With all due apologies to the real Greek chefs out there, 
this version will use a regular pie crust instead of filo, and cottage cheese 
instead of ricotta so it is something that can be duplicated when dad returns 
to Guam.<br>
<br>
Because this pie is for the two most important men in my 
life, I decided to make it my early Valentines for them as well. This will be 
my entry to zorra's &quot; Heart for your Valentine &quot; event at 1x 
umr&uuml;hren bitte . If you're looking for sweet or savory Valentine's Day 
treats, check out zorra's event for some wonderful ideas from all over the 
world (the round-up is updated as new entries come in, so check back often 
until the 16th).<br>
<br>
I (heart) you, Dad and T!!!<br>
<br>
<br>
GREENS AND 
CHEESE PIE<br>
(Inspired by <em>Tastes LIke Home</em>  cookbook )<br>
<br>
2 
pie crusts or pate brisees (use your favorite recipe or commercial brand)<br>

<br>Filling:<br>
1 small tub (12oz, 340g) low-fat cottage cheese<br>
Set a 
strainer over a bowl and drain cheese for at least 8 hours, or overnight, in 
refrigerator. <br>
<br>
1 lb. fresh amaranth, cleaned<br>
1 lb. fresh 
watercress, cleaned and trimmed<br>
 (or use 2 lb. of your favorite greens: 
kale, endive, dandelions, nettles, wild garlic (Baerlauch), mustard greens, 
etc.)<br>
 2-4 cloves garlic, minced<br>
3 TBL. olive oil<br>
sea salt <br>
<br>
Cut greens into 2-in. (3cm) lengths. Heat wok over medium-high heat, swirl oil 
around edges and add garlic. Cook until just fragrant, do not brown. Remove 
garlic and add greens to pan. Season with salt, and continue to saute over 
medium heat. Cover and cook for 5-8 minutes, or until vegetables are bright 
green and just tender. Add garlic back and remove from heat. When cool enough 
to handle, squeeze gently to remove excess water. Set aside. This can be done 
up to 2 days in advance.<br>
<br>
PRE-HEAT OVEN to 400F (200C).<br>
<br>
4-8 
oz. of feta cheese<br>
2 large eggs<br>
2 tsp. dillweed<br>
2 tsp. oregano<br>

1 tsp. thyme<br>
1/2 tsp. chervil (optional)<br>
1 cup fresh minced parsley<br>

1 bunch green onions, chopped (about 1 cup, 150g)<br>
sea salt and ground black 
pepper<br>
<br>
Combine drained cottage and feta cheeses, eggs, herbs and green 
onions. Add drained, cooked greens, and sea salt and ground black pepper to 
taste (it will depend on the saltiness of the cheeses you use).<br>
<br>
Roll 
out one pie crust and mound filling onto crust to within 1-inch (5cm) of the 
edge of the crust. Place second crust over filling and crimp bottom crust over 
the top. Brush with olive oil.<br>
(For Heart-shaped pies, divide each pie 
crust into fourths (you will have 8 quarter-circles). Fold each quarter-circle 
down its center, and using scissors, cut out a heart shape. Repeat with other 
quarter-circles. Fill with about 1 cup filling for each heart, leaving about 
1/2-inch edge. Cover with top heart crust, bring bottom crust over, and crimp. 
Brush with olive oil.)<br>
<br>
Bake on middle shelf of pre-heated oven for 10 
minutes, then turn oven down to 350F/180C. Bake another 35 minutes or until 
crust is golden brown. (Heart-shaped pies, bake another 15-20 minutes, until 
golden brown.) Cool before slicing. Makes a wonderful meat-less meal with a 
crusty bread and crisp white wine, or a vegetable accompaniment to a simple 
roast chicken or fish.<br>

<h1>One Radish, Two Pickles, and a Garnish</h1>  February08 2008 <br>
<br>
The 
Japanese white radish, Daikon, is used in traditional meals in raw, cooked and 
pickled forms. Shredded raw daikon is a common garnish and side dish with 
sashimi &mdash;  its peppery bite complementing the mild cool flavor of the raw 
fish. When we had poke for the Superbowl game last Sunday ( go there ), I 
shredded a large mound of daikon as garnish for the platter, but that still 
left us with 3/4 of the root. I will cook with daikon if a particular dish 
requires it, such as Oden or Okinawan Kombu, but to be honest it's not my 
favorite cooked vegetable. So instead of cooking with it, I decided to pickle 
the remaining daikon two ways.<br>
<br>
<br>
Daikon is a large (1-5 lb) root 
vegetable that can come in many shapes and varieties. I had only ever seen the 
long, white variety (seen here) until we came to Hawaii. Since then we've also 
seen short, thicker, bulbous looking variety labelled in the supermarkets as 
&quot;Korean radish&quot; and another stocky root tinged dark green at the top 
that is also labelled as daikon. When choosing one at the market, the radish 
should feel heavy for its size -- a sign of freshness, since daikon begins 
drying out and losing its water weight the longer it sits after harvesting. I 
also look for small roots &mdash;  one, because larger roots can sometimes be 
woody and unpalatable; and two, because I don't usually cook a lot of daikon at 
one time.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
To prepare, simply wash well with a vegetable 
scrubber and clean water, and peel. To shred, you can use the large holes of a 
regular grater. But I discovered this great tool while I was watching one of 
the workers at our favorite Thai restaurant make long beautiful strips of 
perfectly julienned papaya for a green papaya salad. I walked over to ask her 
if I could take a look at the tool she was using, and she told me I could find 
it at any Filipino (I did not find any at Pacific Supermarket, or any other 
Filipino grocery I know) or Thai grocery. After a few weeks search, I did find 
it at a Thai market in Chinatown ( go there ). With the same easy motion you 
use to peel a potato or carrot, you can make long julienne strips from any 
suitable vegetable: carrots, daikon, potatoes (make shoe-string fries), green 
papaya, sweet potatoes, etc. It takes up much less storage space than a 
mandoline, Benriner or other type of box grater, and cleans up faster and 
easier too. So here we used the julienne-peeler to make a garnish for our poke 
platter.<br>
<br>
<br>
With the remaining daikon, the smaller tapered end was 
also shredded and pickled with carrots, sugar and vinegar in the Vietnamese 
style. This pickle can accompany most Vietnamese stye meals, like the BBQ pork 
with rice noodles ( go there  for recipe). It's also a great sandwich pickle, 
as in Vietnamese bahn mi sandwiches &mdash;  but even a regular tuna, 
ham-and-cheese, or deli turkey sandwich will benefit from this vinegary 
condiment.<br>
<br>
Finally, the larger end was thinly sliced and combined with 
carrots, wakame (wa-KAH-may) seaweed, sugar, salt, rice vinegar, lemon and 
dashi-no-moto to make a Japanese pickle called Namasu (NAH-mah-s'). Like its 
Southeast Asian cousin above, namasu is a quick fresh pickle, and can accompany 
any Japanese rice meal.<br>
<br>
<br>
NAMASU<br>
1 lb. (450g) daikon, scrubbed, 
peeled<br>
1 small carrot (100-120g), scrubbed and peeled<br>
2 tsp. sugar<br>

1 tsp. salt<br>
2 TBL. dried wakame seaweed, placed in a bowl and covered with 
4 cups cool water for 20-30 minutes (not longer)<br>
<br>
Slice daikon 
lengthwise, then into thin half-moon slices. Place in colander and sprinkle 
with sugar, then mix well and leave 30-40 minutes to drain. Sugar will pull 
water from the radish and leave it pliable but crunchy. Do not rinse.<br>
<br>

Using your peeler, slice thin ribbons of carrot from the root. Cut the ribbons 
into fourths across their width. Place in colander, sprinkle with salt and 
leave for 20-40 minutes to drain. Do not rinse.<br>
<br>
Place wakame in small 
bowl and cover with 3 cups cool water for 20-30 minutes. Rinse in 2-3 changes 
of water. Squeeze dry.<br>
<br>
Combine daikon, carrot, and wakame in medium 
bowl.<br>
<br>
Dressing:<br>
1/2 packet dashi-no-moto (dried bonito broth)<br>

1/3 cup warm water<br>
1 tsp. sugar<br>
1/3 cup rice vinegar or white wine 
vinegar (or 1/4 cup white vinegar + 1/2 tsp. sugar)<br>
1 TBL. mirin <br>
1 
TBL. fresh lemon juice <br>
<br>
Combine dressing ingredients in small bowl in 
the order listed above. Whisk or stir well to dissolve sugar and dashi-no-moto. 
Taste and correct seasoning &mdash;  it should taste lemony and 
ever-so-slightly sweet.<br>
<br>
Pour over vegetables and leave in refrigerator 
at least 30 minutes. Keeps in refrigerator up to 5 days.<br>

<h1>Kung Hee Fat Choy: Happy Lunar New Year</h1>  February06 2008 <br>
<br>

Tomorrow officially begins the new lunar year, 4706 &mdash;  The Year of the 
Rat. Here on Oahu the festivities began early in January, and culminated 
publicly over the weekend with three days of partying in Honolulu's Chinatown. 
We caught the tail-end of the parade and the beginning of the street party on 
Saturday. We must have have missed the firecrackers, or perhaps there was a 
rain delay because it was quite wet in town all weekend. Despite the weather, 
hundreds of brave folks lined Hotel Street to watch the parade and stroll along 
the fest tents on Nu'uanu Street to sample fresh-cooked meat skewers, noodles, 
jai (also called monk's food, a vegetarian rice meal filled with good luck 
symbolism), fried rice, plate lunches, dim sum, and the hot 
fried-food-of-the-night &mdash;  &quot;jin doi,&quot; crispy, hollow 
sesame-covered rice balls with a smear of sweet bean paste inside (far right 
photo below). Dad was looking for a remembered treat from Manila that he called 
&quot;tikoy&quot; &mdash;  turned out to be Gau (photo above), the super sticky 
brown-sugar and rice-flour &quot;cake&quot; that is available all over 
Chinatown and much of Oahu this time of year. For such simple ingredients, it's 
quite an addictive treat.<br>
<br>
We only caught the last 2 entries in the 
parade, including this gaily decorated, if slightly water-logged, lion and his 
stalwart handlers.<br>
<br>
After the parade, the lions go their separate ways 
to visit shops and other businesses in the area. People vie to &quot;feed&quot; 
the lions since doing so will bring good luck for the coming year. Many folks 
try to entice their youngsters to bring their &quot;food&quot; to the lions, 
but with their energetic dancing, and flashing bright eyes, the lions could be 
a bit intimidating for the little ones, too. First-timers are often carried by 
their parents. After receiving their monetary meal, the lions often bow in 
front of the donor and sometimes wag their tails!<br>
<br>
Dad made his 
offerings to one of the lions &mdash;  one for Nikko, one for Kenji, and one 
Masato. I couldn't catch them both still, one was always in motion (Dad moves 
fast for a senior citizen!).<br>

<h1>The Challenge: Special Diets and the Superbowl</h1>  February04 2008  
UPDATE: Visit the newGDC Round-up for other gout-friendly recipes <br>
<br>
<br>
<br> In the last week, both T and my dad &mdash; visiting Oahu and now 
scheduled for out-patient surgery tomorrow &mdash;  have had dietary 
restrictions imposed for health reasons. For T these include limiting ginger, 
dairy products, soy products (including miso and tofu), cruciferous vegetables 
(all our favorites: cabbage, broccoli, kale, cauliflower), pine nuts, hot 
peppers, peanuts, and millet. For dad, no red meats (beef, pork, lamb, etc.), 
foods containing yeast (breads, alcohol), red kidney beans, shellfish, fatty 
fish (herring, sardines), grapefruit, fish sauce or anything containing 
anchovies, fried foods, and garlic; and limiting amounts of asparagus, 
mushrooms.<br>
<br>
I began with what we CAN we use: chicken, firm and 
white-flesh fish (no skin), whole grain flat breads and quick breads, whole 
grain pastas and rice, onions, peas, green beans, potatoes, carrots, hard and 
summer squashes, almost all fruits, seaweeds, tree nuts, sweet peppers, 
artichokes, eggplant, tomatoes, corn, soft lettuces, celery, and spinach.<br>

<br> <br>
<br>
The beef and kidney beans restriction pretty much put the kabosh 
on dad making his famous chili for the Superbowl football game last Sunday. 
Instead, we opted to go the local route and make an Hawaiian poke (POH-kay) 
platter, served with fresh (carrot sticks, cucumber, daikon radish, and cherry 
tomatoes), steamed (sugar snap peas) and pickled (kimchee and seaweed salad) 
vegetables. Poke, a combination of raw fish or cooked octopus, sea salt and 
other seasonings, is available ready-made in just about every supermarket on 
Oahu, and makes a great quick meal with a salad and rice. Gotta have rice. 
Having grown up, and now living again, in a rice-focused culture, I&rsquo;ve 
found it hard to completely switch to plain brown rice. The chewy texture is 
pleasant in small doses, and with certain types of foods, but for more 
traditional meals (as with sashimi or poke), the softness and stickiness of 
white rice is essential even if only in part. I&rsquo;ve seen a brown-and-white 
rice blend in some supermarkets, but I&rsquo;m leery of the additional 
processing the brown rice is put through which would allow it to cook with the 
same amount of water as the white variety requires.<br>
<br>
Instead, 
I&rsquo;ve devised a method that allows us to cook the rices together in a rice 
cooker, and produce a nutritional yet fluffy (very important criterion) 
brown-and-white rice. I call the blend &ldquo;mestizo rice&rdquo; (mestizo is a 
Filipino term meaning, &ldquo;of mixed ancestry&rdquo;). All you need is a good 
long soak.<br>
<br>
MESTIZO RICE<br>
150g (3/4 cup) regular brown rice<br>
150g 
(1/2 cup) white medium grain rice<br>
<br>
<br>
Rinse brown rice well, and 
drain. Cover rice with water to 1-inch (4cm) over the top of the rice. Allow to 
soak for at least 8 hours. (Do this in the morning before you go to work.)<br>

<br>When ready to cook, rinse white rice well, and drain. Repeat, until rinse 
water runs clear.<br>
<br>
Drain brown rice. Combine white and brown rices 
together, and add to rice cooker. Add 1-1/4 cup (320ml) water. Turn on rice 
cooker and allow to cook/steam. After rice cooker turns itself off, allow rice 
to finish steaming and do not open lid for at least 15 minutes, but no longer 
than 30.<br>
<br>
Open lid, and with a clean towel, wipe condensation from 
sides and lid of rice cooker. With a rice paddle or spatula, gently turn rice 
over, bringing the rice on the bottom to the top in a folding motion (as you 
would fold in egg whites to a cake batter). Rice is ready to serve.<br>
<br>

Leftover mestizo rice makes a great fried rice, especially with pineapple and 
spices. Read more about making Fried Rice .

<h1>The Way of Cooking: Chicken Soup Revisited</h1>  February04 2008 <br>
<br>

Happy National Homemade Soup Day! Truth to tell, I didn't know such a day 
existed until my sis-in-law, Tra, sent us an e-card to commemorate this happy 
day! (Thanks for the head's-up, Tra!) We can't let an occasion like this pass, 
especially when there is a soup-in-waiting in the fridge as we speak.<br>
<br>

We've touched on the healing properties of soup, especially chicken soup, 
earlier, and how centuries of folk wisdom is now backed by clinical study (see 
Chicken Tinola  post). Chicken soup is the first thing I think to make for 
anyone in crisis, whether it's illness, death in the family, or other emotional 
stress. When someone has no appetite, simply sipping some chicken soup broth 
can be reviving and sustaining.<br>
<br>
<br>
Even when travelling last month, 
I had a chance to make chicken and vegetable soup with another sister-in-law, 
Angie, in Seattle on my way back to Hawaii. With the rain and damp that 
typifies the great Northwest of the US, and after 5 days of travelling and 
eating unwell, it was a luxurious comfort to sit down to a bowl of homemade 
soup. Angie started the soup off in the crockpot with a whole chicken, a couple 
of fingers of ginger, and a couple of carrots. After a night of bubbling and 
simmering, the chicken and vegetables were removed and the broth decanted to a 
shallow container to cool; then refrigerated at least 4 hours to allow the rich 
fat layer to congeal for easy removal. Since we used a whole chicken this time 
(as opposed to just chicken backs, as in the Chicken Tinola  recipe), we kept 
the de-boned breast and thigh meat to return to the soup pot (store separate 
from broth).<br>
<br>
<br>
An hour prior to dinner, carrots, broccoli, 
potatoes, corn, celery, green beans, kale and fun pasta shapes (we used 
&quot;Shrek&quot; pasta from a box of macaroni-and-cheese) were added to a 
boiling broth, along with the diced meat. With some Tafelbrotchen (water rolls) 
and Brezeln from the authentic Deutscher Baeckerei, Hess' Bakery, in nearby 
Lakewood, everyone enjoyed the hearty soup, even restaurant-critic-in-training, 
5-year-old, Masato.<br>
<br>
When my dad arrived on Oahu a couple of days after 
my return, we had chicken and veggie soup again to stave off any airline-borne 
&quot;cooties.&quot; This time, zucchini, watercress, carrots, potatoes, corn, 
and whole wheat penne complemented the broth (from stewing hens) and chicken 
meat. Generous slabs of skillet-baked cornbread rounded out the meal. Chicken 
vegetable soup is as versatile as it is nutritious &mdash;  you can use just 
about any vegetable or combination of vegetables to create a soup you will love.
<br><br>
Enjoy your soup today! <br>
<br>
THE WAY TO COOK: CHICKEN AND 
VEGETABLE SOUP<br>
The Broth:<br>
2 stewing/soup hens (about 3 lbs/1.5 kg, 
total weight)<br>
 OR 5-6 lbs (2.5-3kg) assorted fresh chicken bones from your 
butcher<br>
 OR 1 whole chicken fryer (3-3.5 lb/1.5-2kg)<br>
1 hand of ginger, 
scrubbed well and sliced lengthwise (peeling is optional)<br>
1 lb. carrots, 
scrubbed well and trimmed at the top and bottom (peeling is optional)<br>
1 
medium onion, scrubbed well and dark brown layers removed, halved lengthwise<br>
<br> The critical factor in broth-making is, of course, the bones for flavor, 
the skin for flavor and unctuousness, and the joints/tendons for body. You can 
make soup with fresh chicken carcasses alone, but not with just meat alone. 
Place chicken/bones, ginger, carrots and onion in 6-7quart slow-cooker, and 
cover with water. Set on HIGH for at least 3 hours or until the mixture comes 
to a boil. Remove any &quot;scum&quot; that rises to the surface. Turn 
slow-cooker setting to LOW, and leave for at least 8 hours. Turn off 
slow-cooker and carefully remove the chicken and all solids to a colander 
placed in a large soup pot. or wide cake pan. When cool, debone chicken and 
keep meat in separate container in fridge. Strain broth through a sieve into 
the same pot or pan into which the broth solids earlier drained. When broth 
reaches room temperature, place in a tightly covered container to store in 
fridge overnight.<br>
<br>
Remove most (85%) of fat layer from the chilled 
broth, then return to soup pot or Dutch oven. Add diced chicken meat, 2 cups 
water and bring to rolling boil for at least 10 minutes before adding other 
ingredients.<br>
<br>
To Finish Soup:<br>
Add 3-4 lbs (1.5-2kg) of diced 
vegetables and/or shredded leaf greens as you like or according to what is in 
season. I try to get as many colors of the rainbow as possible into the pot, 
each<br>
providing important nutrients and vitamins:<br>
<br>
 1. First choice 
is always to use fresh vegetables, of course. Eating what is in season and 
local, and preferably organic, will keep your body in tune with your 
environment. The good news is that many frozen vegetables, including peas, 
corn, squashes and leafy greens are just as nutritious frozen as they are 
fresh, and in many cases &mdash;  especially with the corn and peas &mdash;  
taste better flash-frozen than trucked &quot;fresh&quot; miles away from where 
they were born. So don't be shy about using frozen vegetables to <em>supplement
</em>  scarce fresh veggies out of season, but do try to get some fresh 
vegetables in as well.<br>
<br>
 2. Add root and other longer-cooking 
vegetables early on. Save leafy greens and vegetables that turn to mush (e.g., 
potatoes, cooked beans like red kidney or black beans, and hard squashes like 
kabocha) for the last 30 minutes of cooking.<br>
<br>
 3. Choose from:<br>
Root 
vegetables: carrots, parsnips, turnips/rutabaga, potatoes, etc.<br>
Green 
vegetables: green beans, peas, edamame, chayote, broccoli, etc.<br>
Gold 
veggies/Squashes: kabocha, butternut, upo/loofah, wintermelon, corn, etc.<br>

Cooked Beans: kidney, lima, black, navy, etc.<br>
Leaf vegetables: spinach, 
kale, watercress, mustard greens, etc.<br>
Mushrooms: button, crimini, oyster, 
shiitake, chanterelles, etc.<br>
<br>
 4. Add 2 cups of fully cooked small 
pasta shapes (optional).<br>
<br>
 5. Add seasoning to taste: sea salt, ground 
black pepper, and up to 1-1/2 tsp. of chervil, or herb of your choice: fresh 
oregano, marjoram, savory (especially nice if soup includes beans), thyme, 
basil.<br>
<br>
Simmer on medium-low until vegetables are tender and cooked 
through, about 30 minutes to 1 hour, depending on what vegetables you add. 
Taste again to correct seasoning. Serve hot, with bread<br>

<ul> 
<li> 
<ul> 
<li>and salad. </li> </ul></li> </ul> 
<p><br>
Soup with sweet potatoes (pre-cooked leftover), watercress, peas, 
zucchini, carrots, beans, corn and whole wheat penne (leftover).<br>

<h1>As wild as I can get: Warabi (Fiddlehead ferns)</h1>  January31 2008 
UPDATE JANUARY 9, 2009:<br>
<br>
Thanks to Caleb for bringing up a point of 
concern and confusion...<br>
<br>
<br>
Outside of Hawaii, the term 
&ldquo;Warabi&rdquo; is applied to the unfurled fronds of the Fernbracken  ( 
<em>Pteridium aquilinum</em> ), also called simply Bracken (seen at left, with 
thanks to Crizzles). In the last 30 years or so, medical and chemical studies 
have linked chronic or excessive ingestion of Fernbracken by cattle and humans 
to esophageal and stomach tumors, and beriberi disease. Fernbracken can be 
found on every continent except Antartica, according to Wikipedia . It is used 
in traditional medicines of many cultures around the world, and is also a 
popular cooking ingredient (both the fronds and the rhizomes) in Japan and 
Korea. Recently concerns about a possible link between Fernbracken and gastric 
tumors has led authorities to caution people to limit their consumption of 
Fernbracken &ldquo;warabi.&rdquo; But according to the College of Tropical 
Agriculture and Human Resources, UH-Manoa, this does not apply to the Vegetable 
Fern below .<br>
<br>
The frond of the Fernbracken looks different from that of 
its distant cousin, the Vegetable Fern ( <em>Diplazium esculentum, photo below
</em> ), which is the focus of the original post below. Vegetable Fern  (click 
on &ldquo;5. Economic Uses&rdquo; in this link) is found throughout Asia and 
Oceania (which includes Australia and Hawaii) and is a viable and safe food 
crop.<br>
<br>
In Hawaii, the Vegetable Fern is sold as a fresh vegetable under 
the name &ldquo;Ho&lsquo;i&rsquo;o&rdquo; or &ldquo;Warabi,&rdquo; which can 
lead to some confusion with the infamous Fernbracken. To make things even more 
confusing, in Hawaii (and elsewhere, including here in metro DC) you can find 
commercial preparations of pickled or cooked Fernbracken &ldquo;Warabi&rdquo; 
from Japan or Korea (in vacuum sealed packages) in the chilled aisles of Asian 
groceries &mdash; this is the warabi that should be consumed in limited amounts.
<br><br>
I will be very curious to see what is sold as fiddleheads in 
farmers&rsquo; markets in our new locale this spring. I don&rsquo;t expect to 
see Vegetable Fern fronds, but maybe I&rsquo;ll be in for a surprise!<br>
<br>

Original Post <br>
<br>
<em><br>
</em> As I've finally had a chance to sit down 
with one of the long-awaited cookbooks I received for Christmas, I've been 
haunted by the desire for wild greens. Laurie at Mediterranean Cooking in Alaska
, has written a cookbook to benefit the building of her local church in Alaska. 
The cookbook, &quot;Tastes Like Home,&quot; is filled with recipes from the 
church's Greek Orthodox parishioners and are brought to life in the stories and 
histories Laurie has captured here. The most captivating ones for me are always 
those that feature fresh greens, but there is special emphasis in this book on 
wild greens. And so I'm itching for something wild, something green. I confess 
I don't know the first thing about hunting wild greens, especially here in the 
Islands, but I always pounce on anything that remotely resembles a wild green 
in a market.<br>
<br>
Which is how I came to know this fernhead green, sold 
locally as warabi. I love the kind of dragon-in-waiting feel the lone 
fiddlehead has. Warabi is easy to clean and prepare. Here we flash-cooked it 
with garlic, olive oil and sea salt (see Watercress post  for cooking method). 
It lacks the bite, or slight bittterness, I crave with wild greens, but it's 
certainly a fun vegetable to work (and play) with! See also Sesame Warabi . <em>

<h1>Honolulu's Chinatown, Part 2: Best Buys</h1>  January27 2008 <br>
<br>

Next Thursday, February 7th, is the start of the year 4706 in the Chinese 
calendar and, as my niece's new T-shirt points out, is also called the Year of 
the Rat. People born in the Years of the Rat (1924, 1936, 1948. 1960, 1972, 
1984, 1996 and this year) are said to be intelligent, just, balanced, orderly, 
and honest in personal relationships, or so says our all-knowing wall calendar! 
(Were you born in a Year of the Rat?) Festivities to welcome the new year are 
well underway in Honolulu's Chinatown and other Chinese communities around the 
island, but key festivities still remain (see side bar at bottom). Streets are 
festooned with colorful lanterns and signs bearing wishes for prosperity and 
long health; dragon-like lions wend their way through shops, banks, markets, 
and malls; and the air cracks with sharp reports of firecrackers to ward off 
evil spirits and bad luck. If you need a reason to venture into Chinatown, 
these last few days leading up to the New Year are a great time to visit this 
historic district at its prettiest and liveliest. Shops and restaurants are 
filled with special foods, prices can be even more competitive than ever, and 
there is just an air of celebration and anticipation.<br>
<br>
As far as we're 
concerned, though, T and I think any day is a great day to be in Chinatown. As 
outlined in the earlier post, Honolulu's Chinatown: come see what you've been 
missing , we visit a couple of times a month for the freshest local produce, 
noodles, seafoods, smoothies (see Summer Frappe  post) and ready-cooked meats, 
dumplings, and other goodies. Locations and some parking options were also 
covered earlier. Here we highlight some of our key finds.<br>
<br>
<br>
Goji 
berries, aka wolfberries (Fructus lycii). We've used this medicinally for 
several years, but within the last year include wolfberries in our weekday 
daily breakfast oatmeal. Generous 1lb. packages retail between $4.50-$8.00 -- 
perhaps a third to half the retail cost we've seen elsewhere.<br>
<br>
<br>
As 
mentioned inearlier posts, we prefer to shop for produce here because the 
turnover is so high that freshness is almost a given. We frequent many of the 
vegetable vendors, but our first stop is always a stall in the Kekaulike Mall 
marketplace called Cheap Market, Kahuku Farmers (right photo) for our leafy 
greens&mdash; watercress, choy sum, Chinese broccoli, baby bok choy, dill, 
herbs, and gai choy&mdash; but they have many others as well. <br>
<br>
<br>

Kitchen tools I love: The julienne peeler (left), allows you to make julienne 
slices as easily as peeling a potato ($7-8), from Hong Fa Thai market on 
Maunakea/Pauahi. A Laotian rice steamer for sticky rice; the aluminum pot and 
bamboo basket are sold separately, and the assembly retails less than $20; also 
at Hong Fa. Vietnamese drip coffeemaker, a relaxing way to enjoy your favorite 
cup of joe on the weekend, with or without the traditional condensed milk 
accompaniment, retails less than $5 at most Vietnamese markets along King.<br>

<br> Kitchen collectibles: I have a weakness for wood kitchen articles, old and 
new. These antique mooncake molds and hand-grater are from Guan Hua (Chinese 
antiques and reproductions) on King.<br>
<br>
For newer mooncake molds, check 
out Bo Wah on Maunkea. If you're discerning about hair care and insist on a 
boar-bristle brush, consider also using a wood, rather than plastic, comb. Wood 
is said to be less likely to pull (and therefore, weaken) hair; and to provide 
a massage-like feeling on the scalp to promote blood circulation. I love them 
&mdash;  the top right 3 are mine, I have one at home and one in my purse, and 
one in my backpack; all the others are gifts for family. All the models shown 
retail less than $6, except for the 2-tone one which starts at $18 (depends on 
size and type of wood used). Available at the Americomb House on Maunkea/King 
&mdash;  it's hard to miss with a giant wood comb in the window!<br>
<br>
Char 
Hung Sut Manapua Factory's hand-made selection includes sweets and savories for 
every taste. Go early, things start selling out by mid-morning.<br>
<br>
The 
selection of roasted chicken, char siu, pork, duck, as well as various kinds of 
offal at the ever-popular Wing Loy's BBQ on Maunakea. We also frequent Hong 
Kong style BBQ at the Far Eastern Center on King, and Nam Fong, also on 
Maunakea.<br>
<br>
<br>
Fresh local and imported fruit selections are 
unparalleled. Visitors and picnickers looking for a ready-made taste of the 
islands will find cleaned and cut fruit bowls ranging from $2-4, depending on 
the fruits included. Chau's Fruits (middle) at the Hotel St. entrance to the 
Maunakea Markets, Summer Frappe in the Maunakea courtyard, and several vendors 
in the Food Court have ice-cold fruit bowls from which to choose. It's the best 
way to try a new fruit, too, if you're unsure how to prepare or eat it &mdash;  
everything from the common (in Hawaii) pineapples and mangos, to watermelon, 
rambutan, sapote, dragonfruit, jackfruit and durian (seasonal).<br>
<br>
Here's 
a special find for connoisseurs of fish cakes. These are made daily from fresh 
spearfish/marlin at KC Meatball House, one of the stalls inside the Markets at 
Kekaulike Mall. KC also carries Asian-style (bound with cornstarch for a 
springy texture) pork meatballs that are one of T's favorites.<br>
<br>
This 
factory on Likelike Mall produces hundreds of the thin, rolled rice sheet 
noodles in shrimp (tiny dried kind), plain and char siu flavors. Each roll is 
$1 or less, depending on the flavor. Recipe: Char-siu or Shrimp Funn with Chive 
Oil .<br>
<br>
This small dark store-front on King Street, just ewa of 
Kekaulike Mall, belies the bustling noodle factory inside. Dozens of types of 
fresh-made wheat and egg noodles in varying thicknesses and forms, as well as 
wrappers for wonton, gyoza and mandoo are available. A price list is posted in 
the foyer just before you step down into the factory proper to place your 
order. Often there's a line here (but it moves quickly) so you may have time to 
peruse the list and make your selections before you get to the counter. Shown 
here are udon (left) and thick saimin noodles, both sell for $1.00/lb.<br>
<br>

<br> Ready for lunch? Dim sum at Good Luck Chinese restaurant at Mauna 
Kea/Beretania allows diners to select from dozens of steamed, fried and sauteed 
dishes from their traveling carts or off the extensive menu.<br>
<br>
Pho 97 on 
Maunakea, near the Marketplace entrance, is our go-to stop for all Vietnamese 
meals: BBQ pork bun (left), Vietnamese mung bean crepe, or soups.<br>
<br>
Want 
something faster than a sit-down restaurant affords? The food court at the 
Maunakea Marketplace has the most compelling assortment of Asian food stalls on 
Oahu: Singaporean, Malaysian, Thai, Laotian, Filipino, Korean, Japanese and 
Vietnamese vendors offer fully-cooked meals ready to take, as well as 
short-order items like noodle soups cooked to order. Of the more than dozen 
stalls here, almost half offer Filipino foods so if you've ever been curious 
about Filipino foods, this is the place to sample different regional styles.<br>
<br>This is in no way a complete list, just a few of our favorites. We've only 
been exploring for 2 years, so if we've missed your favorite haunt or you know 
we're missing out on a great product, please share it with us by leaving a 
comment below. And if you've recently visited this vibrant district yourself, 
we'd love to hear what your experience was like. <br>

<h1>Table-top Cooking: Sukiyaki</h1>  January24 2008 <br>
<br>
As promised, 
the second part of the Table-top Cooking series features the ever-popular 
Sukiyaki. Like teppan-yaki style grilling ( BBQ pork and bun post ), there's no 
reason this entertaining communal style of dining has to be regulated to exotic 
evenings out at a Japanese restaurant. With the small investment of a single 
burner butane stove ($15-30, depending on your neighborhood), a few butane 
cartridges ($1-3 a piece), and some basic cookware, you can create this meal 
any time at home. A suitable pan for sukiyaki is one that is relatively 
low-brimmed and wide, with no long handles -- in this photo, we are using a 
paella-style pan.<br>
<br>
Sukiyaki (SKI-yah-ki) is simply a braised meat and 
vegetable &quot;stew&quot; featuring thin-sliced beef, tofu, negi (Japanese 
leeks), enoki and shiitake mushrooms, spinach or shingiku (chrysanthemum 
leaves), and shirataki (yam noodles. a form of konnyaku). Traditionally, 
sukiyaki was a winter meal cooked over a charcoal brazier built in to a table. 
The brazier served both to warm the room and the diners, as well as to cook the 
meal. Usually one person is in charge of keeping the pot full and evenly 
cooked, and the other diners select cooked pieces from the bubbling pot to put 
first into an individual serving bowl. Often each diner has a second smaller 
bowl with a beaten raw egg in it &mdash; - the hot pieces of meat and 
vegetables are dipped into the beaten egg before being eaten with rice. The 
beaten egg serves 2 purposes, first to cool the hot food coming directly from 
the fire; second, to envelop each bite in a silken robe of deliciousness that 
(for me) is the signature of sukiyaki. The egg, however, is completely optional 
and, of course, should not be consumed by anyone with a compromised immune 
system, very young children, or pregnant persons. Use only the freshest eggs 
available, carefully washing each egg in a solution of 2 TBL. white vinegar in 
1 quart/liter of water.<br>
<br>
Sukiyaki is more a method than a recipe, like 
the Way to Cook. Besides cleaning and prepping all the ingredients, the only 
thing requiring a recipe is the braising sauce in which all the ingredients are 
cooked. Because the ingredients may be a little strange to most people, a brief 
description and tips for prepping each are included below. If some ingredients 
are not available to you, suggestions for substitutions are included.<br>
<br>

<br> <br>
SHIRATAKI: A form of konnyaku, shaped as &quot;noodles&quot;; 
konnyaku is a gelatin-like product made from the root of the &quot;devil's 
tongue plant,&quot; a relative of the sweet potato. Konnyaku and shirataki have 
been gaining ground in Western kitchens as health and diet food because they 
have virtually no calories, and are flavorless on their own so will absorb the 
flavors of whatever medium they are cooked in. Konnyaku (and shirataki) is also 
recognized for its ability to rid the body of toxins -- in Japan, it is known 
as &quot;the broom of the body&quot; as it contains a dietary fiber that is 
indigestible yet gentle to the stomach and intestines, sweeping away undigested 
food and other sediment on its journey through the system. Both shirataki and 
konnyaku come in white and brown varieties; since it is flavorless, choice is a 
matter of your aesthetic, but the white form is more often used. Shirataki has 
a definite gelatinous quality &mdash;  imagine if you could cut jello into 
strips and pick them up with chopsticks &mdash;  and some people balk at this 
texture. Think of them as noodles, though, and they may be less objectionable. 
Remove from package and rinse well under running water and drain. Cut into 
roughly 3&quot; lengths.<br>
Substitutions: really, only konnyaku, which is in 
block form, is a substitute; you can slice it lengthwise into a noodle-like 
shape, or try the decorative style used in another Japanese classic, Oden or 
Kombu ( directions  here). Konnyaku and shirataki are always kept in the 
chilled section of your market -- on Oahu, virtually every grocery store 
carries it. Because of its new-found popularity, you may be able to find 
konnyaku, if not shirataki, in a health food store if you don't have a 
well-stocked Oriental market nearby.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
NEGI: Japanese leek, 
has a sharper flavor and firmer texture than the more familiar leek. Rinse 
whole leek, especially the root ends, then begin slicing on a sharp diagonal up 
to the light green tips. Fill a large non-reactive container with a solution of 
1 TBL. white vinegar for every 1 quart/liter of water used, and place sliced 
leeks in this solution. Swish around gently, then let sit for about one minute. 
Swish again, then gently lift out all the leeks and place in a colander. Rinse 
well with running water and drain well. (Use this method for cleaning regular 
leeks as well). Substitutions: regular leeks (if neither is available, thinly 
sliced yellow onions may be used)<br>
<br>
<br>
SHIITAKE: Dried Shiitake 
Mushrooms, see Braised Mushroom  post for how-to prepare. Substitutions: any 
earthy fresh mushroom might work, shiitake, portobella, cremini, even oyster.
<br> <br>
<br>
ENOKI MUSHROOM: Fresh tendril-like enoki are another sponge-like 
ingredient that readily absorbs the braising sauce. To prepare, rinse gently 
under running water and pat dry. Substitutions: shimeji mushrooms or leave out 
all together.<br>
<br>
<br>
TOFU: Firm or extra-firm plain tofu found in the 
chilled area of the grocery/health store. To prepare, remove and drain, then 
wrap tightly in a clean kitchen towel and place in a container with a heavy 
dish pressing on the tofu (you're trying to extract as mush water as possible 
from the tofu). Leave in fridge for at least 2 hours. Remove toweling, and cut 
tofu into 1.5&quot; (8cm) blocks. Tofu is a sponge for flavor, and the savory 
broth and braising liquid in sukiyaki makes bland tofu quite delicious and 
meaty-tasting.<br>
<br>
When cleaned and prepped, assemble these ingredients in 
a large platter. <br>
<br>
<br>
BEEF: Paper-thin slices of very lean beef are 
traditionally used. In Japan, as in most Asian cultures, meat is used as a 
flavoring agent rather than a focus of a meal. Therefore, 1/2lb. (250g) is 
enough for 4 persons. Almost every grocery on Oahu carries sukiyaki-sliced beef 
(it's actually labelled that way), but I've found the leanest and thinnest 
slices from Star Market. Elsewhere, Vietnamese and Korean markets have 
similarly sliced cuts. If you don't have an Asian butcher in the vicinity, ask 
your butcher to slice a round roast into paper-thin slices (about the thickness 
of deli-meats). Substitutions: maybe pork or chicken (haven't tried it). Place 
meat on a separate platter.<br>
<br>
<br>
GREENS: Spinach and/or Shingiku are 
the traditional greens used. See Gai Choy  post for cleaning and prepping leafy 
greens. This photo shows spinach and watercress. Substitutions: any 
quick-cooking leafy green or combination of greens. Place drained greens in a 
large bowl.<br>
<br>
In Japan, diners begin their meal with a saying that is 
part exclamation, part blessing, &quot;Itadakimasu!&quot; 
(EE-tah-dah-kee-mas'). There is no direct English translation, but it is an 
older expression meaning, &quot;I will receive&quot; and is said to express the 
diners' thankfulness for the food about to be consumed &mdash;  gratitude not 
only for the actual food, but also for the sacrifices and hard work (in the 
farm, field and kitchen) that produced the meal. I hope this meal will inspire 
a mood of both celebration and thankfulness at your table too!<br>
<br>
SUKIYAKI
<br>(for 4 persons)<br>
<br>
Prepare the braising sauce:<br>
1 packet instant 
dashi no moto (dashi broth)<br>
3 cups hot water<br>
5 TBL. brown sugar<br>
6 
TBL. soy sauce<br>
6 TBL. mirin<br>
3 TBL. sake<br>
<br>
In a small sauce pan, 
dissolve dashi no moto in hot water, then add sugar to blend completely. Add 
soy, mirin and sake, stir to blend. Set aside to cool while preparing 
vegetables (see above) and plating meat (see above). When ready to begin, put 
braising sauce in a pitcher-like container for easy pouring at the table. You 
can keep refilling the small table-side pitcher as needed from the sauce pan.
<br> <br>
<br>
To set the table:<br>
Place butane stove and pan at center of 
table, closest to the designated cook. Each diner will need a rice bowl, a wide 
shallow bowl for their individual serving, a smaller cup-like bowl for the 
beaten egg (if using), and chopsticks. The cook will need to have close at hand:
<br> long chopsticks or tongs<br>
 the assembled ingredients<br>
 the braising 
sauce<br>
 cooking oil (only at the start of the cooking)<br>
 a tall cold 
drink (this is going to be hot work, tending the pot and watching everyone else 
eat!)<br>
<br>
To begin, pre-heat the pan over a medium fire then add a scant 2 
TBL. olive oil and 3-4 slices of beef, and allow to brown very well. It's okay 
if the meat sticks slightly to the pan, but don't let it burn. Those browned 
bits are an important flavor base for your sauce. Once the meat has browned, 
add 1/3 of the negi (leeks), 3-4 more slices of beef, and enough braising sauce 
to come up about half way up the ingredients in the pan. Now add small handfuls 
of each of the other ingredients to the pan and keep the braising liquid 
simmering &mdash;  you'll have to turn the heat up as you add ingredients and 
sauce, then back down as things get cooked. Try to keep similar ingredients 
together, both for aesthetic reasons and to help the diners locate what they're 
hungry for next! When adding more raw meat to the mix, I try to push all the 
fully cooked ingredients to the other end of the pan, as far away as possible.
<br> <br>
<br>
To eat, the cook can either serve each person a portion of all 
the cooked bits in their individual serving bowls, or the diners can fill their 
own bowls with what they like. A note about etiquette at the sukiyaki table: 
diners should not dip their chopsticks into the sauce, or touch food that they 
do not put into their own bowl (i.e., don't use your chopsticks to move food 
around in the pan). One way around this is to have a set of serving chopsticks 
or tongs to allow diners to choose foods from the pan, or allow the chef to use 
the cooking 'sticks to fill bowls. Of course, when it's just family, who's 
gonna tell on you, right? : ) From their individual bowls, diners can then dip 
each mouthful in a beaten egg, and savor. <br>
<br>
Aahhh, sukiyaki in the 
comfort of your own home. &quot;Itadakimasu,&quot; indeed! <br>

<p><br>
</p> 
<p></p> <br>
UPDATE: <br>
<br>
<br>
I&quot;ve received a couple of emails 
about the use of udon noodles with sukiyaki. We always added cooked udon 
noodles at the very end of cooking, after most of the diners were sated and the 
last of the ingredients were fully cooked in the pan. The noodles sit in the 
braising liquid overnight in the refrigerator and fully absorb all the flavors 
of the pan by morning. You will have a wonderful breakfast or bento once 
re-heated fully in a microwave or by returning the pan to the fire. I always 
understood using udon as a way of not wasting the flavor-laden sauce at the 
end. I suppose you could include udon earlier in the process as well, and enjoy 
it as a substitute for, or in addition to, plain rice. Thanks to Debi and to 
Karl for your questions!<br>

<h1>5-A-Day: Flash-Cooked Watercress</h1>  January22 2008 <br>
<br>
Still 
starved for fresh greens, I bought 3 large bunches of watercress in Chinatown. 
The photo here shows 1 bunch of cleaned, trimmed cress. I'm a bit embarrassed 
to admit that before coming to Hawaii I only considered cress for 2 things: tea 
sandwiches and a plate garnish. Pretty sad, no? Both these ideas came from my 
training in London, but I'm glad I've overcome these limitations in my thinking 
and have embraced watercress for the versatile, nutritious vegetable it truly 
is.<br>
<br>
Watercress, like mustard greens (see earlier post ), is a 
cruciferous vegetable and like its cousins broccoli and cabbage, has long been 
recognized as an important source of calcium, iron and folic acid. According to 
Wikipedia, it is one of the oldest known leaf greens eaten by humans ( read more
). Eaten raw, watercress is prized for its peppery flavor; but when cooked, it 
takes on a more savory, almost tangy character, that stands up well like to 
strong flavors such as garlic or fermented black bean sauce, both popular 
preparations in restaurants serving knowledgeable Chinese clientele. Again, if 
you like strong flavored greens such as endive, chicory or broccoli rabe, 
there's a good chance you will enjoy watercress both raw and cooked.<br>
<br>

Perhaps the best incentive to add this delicious green to your culinary 
repetoire is the exciting research coming out of the University of Ulster (UK) 
in the last year about the anti-cancer properties of watercress. That study 
found that daily intake of a modest amount of watercress (about 85g) can 
significantly reduce an important cancer trigger, namely DNA damage to white 
blood cells; as well as lowering cholesterol and improving absorption of lutein 
and beta-carotene, key minerals for eye health and the prevention of 
age-related conditions such as cataracts. Read more about this on the Medical 
News Today site .<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
If you're lucky enough to live near 
Alresford, Hampshire, UK, you can attend the Watercress Festival  on Sunday, 
May 11, 2008. There is also a newer festival in the US that celebrates 
watercress in Osceola, Wisconsin &mdash;  the third annual fest should be in 
late spring (no details available yet).<br>
<br>
Here on Oahu, watercress grows 
in a most amazing locale. This close view of the Sumida Farms in Aiea (at 
right) shows us the lush vegetation amid irrigation culverts one would expect 
in a watercress farm.<br>
<br>
But the larger view reveals that this 
beautifully cultivated and landscaped oasis of edible green fronts one of the 
major east-west thoroughfares on Oahu, Farrington Highway, and is bounded on 
its other three side by a large shopping mall, Pearlridge Center! The first 
photo is taken from the highway, which sits right beside the northernmost end 
of Pearl Harbor, and looks to the northeast corner of the farm. The second 
photo is taken from the northern (mauka) side of the shopping center, looking 
back towards Pearl Harbor (makai) and the highway side of the farm. Cultivation 
and harvest is year-round, as evidenced by the taller dark green patches 
adjacent to apparently harvested lighter colored patches. What a poetic 
resource!<br>
<br>
<br>
So how to incorporate watercress into your diet? Well, 
instead of looking for specific recipes for watercress, again I would recommend 
using it in your own favorite preparations for fresh spinach or braised greens. 
Of the 3 bunches we bought, one was braised with garlic using the same method 
as for the Mustard Greens ( see post ), one was used along with spinach in 
Sukiyaki (coming soon), and one was flash-cooked for later use as a topping for 
Okinawan soba or ramen. When we buy very perishable greens such as watercress 
or mustard greens, I will usually either garlic-braise or flash-cook them 
within a day of purchase. Cooked, the greens take up less precious fridge space 
and are no longer susceptible to wilting. I've also provided myself with some 
handy timesavers for mid-week meals: with cold potatoes and eggs, we can have a 
frittata in 20 minutes, or an omelet in 10; with a few additional spices and 
perhaps a sauce, we will have a great pasta; with a sesame dressing, we have a 
cooked salad to accompany any meal; after a 10 second buzz in a microwave, we 
have a great topping for ramen; or it can provide a healthy boost to your 
favorite soup recipe &mdash;  a couple of nights ago we added some flash-cooked 
watercress in the last 10 minutes of cooking a homemade chicken vegetable soup. 
One recipe still on the back burner in my mind is to substitute all of the 
spinach in a spinach dip with watercress &mdash;  I'll get back to you on that 
one, but if someone out there does it sooner, I'd love to hear how that worked 
for you!<br>
<br>
Until then, here is my method for flash-cooking watercress, 
or any easy-to-cook green.<br>
<br>
FLASH-COOKED WATERCRESS<br>
<br>
1 large 
bunch watercress, about 1lb (450g)<br>
2-4 TBL. olive oil<br>
2-5 cloves 
garlic, diced (optional)<br>
sea salt (optional)<br>
<br>
Trim hollow stems of 
watercress to about 1-inch (5cm) of the leafy parts. Wash thoroughly in clean 
water, and vinegar-water solution (see Mustard Greens post  for detailed 
directions on washing leafy greens). Cut into 2-inch (10cm) lengths.<br>
<br>

Heat wok or other large pot just to smoking point. Add enough olive oil to coat 
wok/pot, then add garlic, if using, and let gently brown (about 10-15 seconds), 
then remove from pan.<br>
<br>
Add watercress, and using 2 wooden spoons or 
spatulas, turn to coat with oil. Add more oil to the sides of the wok, if 
necessary, but not directly on the greens. Continue cooking on medium-high to 
high heat until the cress wilts and becomes bright green. Remove from heat and 
add salt to taste, if using (I don't use salt if I'm not using the greens right 
away). Cover and leave in pan another 5 minutes.<br>
<br>
Gently squeeze greens 
to remove excess moisture, and either dress and use right away, or store in 
fridge for up to 3 days. If storing, be certain the greens will be cooked again 
(as in soup, Plasto , tortilla, etc.). If using as a ramen topping or side 
dish, microwave briefly to heat through before serving.<br>
<br>
<br>
SESAME 
DRESSING<br>
2-4 cloves garlic, finely minced<br>
3 TBL. toasted (aka 
&quot;dark) sesame oil<br>
1 TBL. raw sugar<br>
1 tsp. sea salt<br>
2 TBL. 
mirin, sake, or sherry<br>
1 tsp. soy sauce<br>
<br>
Sesame seeds for garnish 
(optional)<br>
<br>
Mix together sugar, salt, mirin and soy sauce. Stir to 
dissolve sugar. Pour over cooked cress and garnish with sesame seeds.<br>
<br>

nutritious one-bowl meal.<br>

<h1>5-A-Day: Chinese mustard greens (Gai Choy)</h1>  January20 2008 <br>
<br>

Whew . . . !! After 7 days away &mdash;  4 and 1/2 of which were spent in a car 
or plane, or at an airport &mdash; it is GOOD to be back home. In addition to 
the stress of travel, we were traveling to a funeral so there was the added 
emotional toll as well. Having arrived home after too many meals that were 
deep-fried or involved hamburgers, I am really craving greens of any kind! A 
leisurely trip to Chinatown yesterday allowed us to pick up some of our 
favorites at their freshest -- watercress, Chinese mustard cabbage, and baby 
bok choy.<br>
<br>
It's true that all these greens are available at most of the 
groceries around the island, so why do we trek 25 miles into town and pay for 
parking to shop in Chinatown? Selection. Quality. Prices are also generally 
20-40 percent cheaper than at the supermarkets, too, but unless you are buying 
in quantity or buying a lot of groceries, the savings may not make up what you 
will pay to park your car (see earlier post about Chinatown  for details). The 
main reason we like the produce in Chinatown is the incredibly high turnover 
rate of both fruits and vegetables in almost all the markets there. What is put 
on the shelves at 7 or 8 a.m. is generally gone before lunch time! This 
translates to produce that is really fresh, and hasn't been sitting on a 
too-cold supermarket produce counter for days. Many vendors continue to 
replenish their tables until lunch, but by the afternoon the remaining produce 
has been pretty picked over.<br>
<br>
Today will highlight the first of two 
lovely green vegetables that deserve a larger place in our vegetable repetoire, 
Chinese mustard cabbage. The next post will highlight our all-time favorite, 
Watercress.<br>
<br>
Chinese mustard greens, also called <em>gai choi</em> , is 
a peppery variety of the cabbage family. The specimen in this photo is fully 
mature and should be cooked. Both the stems and leaves are edible and will cook 
to a pungent, peppery finish. If slow-cooked, it will become meltingly tender, 
like collards or mustard greens, but will keep its peppery bite. If you like 
broccoli rabe, arugula (&quot;rocket&quot; to our friends in the UK), or 
Belgian endive, you will probably like gai choy. Younger gai choy will have 
slender, straight, dark green stems, and can be eaten raw as a salad green, or 
quickly stir-fried. It has less of a bite than a fully mature cabbage, more 
like a nibble.<br>
<br>
<br>
Cleaning Vegetables in a Vinegar Wash <br>
To 
prepare mature gai choy for cooking, remove stems from core and wash well first 
in clean container of water, rubbing away the soil and grit at the bottom of 
the stems. Remove vegetables from water, drain water and fill container with a 
solution of 2 TBL. white vinegar and 2 quarts/liters cool water. Rinse stems 
and leaves thoroughly in this solution. Lift out of water, swishing leaves 
gently as you lift (avoid dumping water out of container while greens are still 
in the water &mdash;  it is easier for grit and dirt to remain on your greens. 
Rinse again with clean water. Drain in colander.<br>
<br>
Separate stems and 
leafy parts. Halve and julienne leafy greens; and halve and dice stems. If 
using for braised dishes or soups, add thick stem pieces early to cook down, 
and leafy bits in the last 15-20 minutes of cooking. Recipes previously posted 
that would work well with gai choy: Portuguese Bean Soup , or Chicken Tinola  
(Chicken and Green Papaya soup) or Plasto  (Greek cornbread and greens). Or try 
substituting gai choy for all or half the regular greens in your favorite 
recipe for slow-cooked Collard Greens or Mustard Greens. Here is a quick and 
simple way to cook gai choy: Garlic Braised Mustard Cabbage.<br>
<br>
<br>

GARLIC BRAISED MUSTARD CABBAGE<br>
I large bunch mustard cabbage, or gai choy, 
cleaned, stemmed and diced/julienned (see above)<br>
2-3 TBL. olive oil<br>
4-6 
cloves garlic, chopped<br>
1/4 cup chicken or vegetable broth, or water<br>
1/2 
tsp. sea salt (optional)<br>
1/2 tsp. ground black pepper (optional)<br>
<br>

Heat oil in wok over medium-high heat. Add garlic and stir to release fragrance 
and gently brown, then remove garlic and keep aside. Add cleaned mustard greens 
stem pieces to oil, add broth, cover and let cook 10-20 minutes, or until 
beginning to soften. Stir to mix well, then add leafy parts of cabbage, cover 
and cook another 5-8 minutes, or until leafy parts are bright green. Remove 
cover and allow broth to reduce by half. Season to taste with sea salt and 
pepper, if using. Remove to serving plate and garnish with browned garlic.<br>

<br>We serve this as a side dish with any meal, from meatloaf and mashed 
potatoes, to rice and pan-seared tofu (Okinawan Champuru). I especially enjoy 
gai choy prepared this way and served with its garlicky pan gravy on top of 
mashed potatoes for a filling and delicious non-meat meal.<br>

<h1>Packed for Travel: Miso-glazed Chicken</h1>  January12 2008 <br>
My bento 
is ready to go and so am I. An unexpected trip to the Bayou State has presented 
itself and I will be away one week. Airline meals being what they are, I 
usually pack my own when I can, like this easy meal of rice, pickled plum, 
(umeboshi), pickled ginger, sesame burdock and carrots (kinpira) and 
miso-glazed chicken. Simple flavors, lots of rice and ginger for a sometimes 
queasy stomach, and I'm good to go. Miso glazed chicken is quick and easy 
enough for weeknight meals, but elegant enough as well for your next dinner 
party.<br>
<br>
<br>
MISO-GLAZED CHICKEN<br>
 1lb (450g) boneless chicken<br>

3/4 cup (375ml) water<br>
1/2 cup sake, or dry sherry, or apple juice<br>
1 
slice fresh ginger <br>
2 TBL. mirin<br>
3 TBL. sugar<br>
4 TBL. white (aka 
&quot;shiro&quot;) miso paste<br>
<br>
<br>
Combine water, sake and ginger in 
saute pan. Lay chicken in pan, and bring liquid to a boil, then reduce heat to 
simmer and cook about 5 minutes.<br>
<br>
Turn chicken over in pan, and add 
mirin, sugar and miso paste. Cover and simmer another 5 minutes.<br>
<br>

Remove cover and continue cooking until liquid thickens and coats chicken. Turn 
meat to glaze both sides. Remove from heat. Garnish with green onions, or 
sesame seeds.

<h1>Recap: Cakes, Nuts, Crab Cioppino</h1>  January09 2008 A quick summary of 
recipes that didn't get posted during the holiday sabbatical, but were too 
delicious to ignore.<br>
<br>
<br>
First was a dried fruit and nutcake that 
just happened to also be vegan. I say it that way because there's a 
misconception that vegan desserts = &quot;dry, crumbly and and 
uninteresting.&quot; I confess, I've thought that myself. But done right, and 
with recipes developed by people who love good food, vegan sweets are light, 
luscious and very ono. The vegan butterscotch quick bread by Hannah of 
Bittersweet  that we made in October ( see post ) proved that point, and so did 
this brandy-soaked dried fruit and nut cake from bee and Jai at Jugalbandi . 
Their recipe provided enough batter for a gift cake (shown here, made with a 
Gugelhupf pan &mdash;  smaller than a Bundt) and a 8x8 cake for us. Bee 
recommended soaking the dried fruits in rum for a month before baking! <br>
 I 
only had 3 days to soak my cherries, apricots and raisins in brandy, but I 
would like to try the longer soaking method in future. I did save the soaking 
liquid, poured it over the square cake, wrapped it tightly in plastic and foil, 
and kept it in the fridge until after new year's. We had our first slices this 
past weekend over a beach-side breakfast &mdash; I have to say, our spirits 
rose with the sun! It is so flavorful and moist, it's hard to believe it was 
made without eggs or oil. I'm not a fan of glaced fruit, so I don't like 
traditional fruitcakes. This, however, is a cake of a different order. Bee's 
Fruit and Nut Cake recipe . <br>
<br>
<br>
We were invited to a wonderful 
Italian-American Christmas dinner with our friends Laurie and Brian and their 
family. Chef Brian prepared stromboli, veal parmesan, and spaghetti with 
meatballs, all from scratch &mdash;  he was prepping into the wee hours of 
Christmas morning, bless him! I offered to make Tiramisu for dessert, in 
keeping with their Italian menu. Laurie is expecting their third child in 
February so the raw eggs in my usual recipe were out of the question. Instead, 
I tried a creme anglaise base so the eggs were cooked before adding the other 
custard ingredients, and proceeded as usual. I was impressed how close this 
came to the original, without the worry of having to use raw eggs! This may be 
my recipe of choice in future because it does eliminate the concern about the 
eggs. Don't be tempted to substitute cocoa powder for the grated chocolate in 
this recipe. Chalky powder (no matter which brand) can't compete with the 
creamy texture and taste grated dark chocolate lends this recipe. Tiramisu, 
custard-based recipe . Our thanks and love to Brian and Laurie for sharing 
their family celebration this year &mdash;  Chef B, you're the best!<br>
<br>

This was an alternative recipe for sweet spiced nuts ( see post ) that does not 
use egg whites. It's actually more like the candied walnuts (minus the sugar 
coating) we had with the spicy prawns at our favorite Chinese restaurant, and 
they are certainly tasty. But (you knew there was a &quot;but&quot; coming) 
they're cooked first in a sugar syrup, cooled in syrup overnight, dried another 
night, deep-fried, and coated in sugar. It's pretty time-consuming, and very 
laden with fat and sugar. With that word to the wise, here's the recipe for 
Crispy Sweet Walnuts .<br>
<br>
<br>
For our second consecutive Christmas Eve 
we had Dungeness crab cioppino. Little piece of heaven. Until we moved to 
Hawaii 3 years ago, I had not had Dungeness in 10 years, and T had never tried 
it. Having grown up in Maine and around lobster boats as a teen, dear hubby was 
of the opinion that no crab was worth the effort of all the work it took to eat 
it. He had never tried Dungeness. Let's just say, in the immortal words of 
&quot;The Borg&quot;: he was assimilated. This is the first time we've included 
fresh clams &mdash;  their extra sweetness was a delight, but not necessary if 
they're not available where you are. Dungeness crab cioppino recipe . <br>

<h1>UPDATES: On Reiki, The Real Etouffee, and Olives Redux</h1>  January08 2008
 On Reiki<br>

<p>Just for today, <br>
<br>
 I will not anger<br>
<br>
 I will not worry<br>

<br> I will be grateful<br>
<br>
 I will work hard on myself<br>
<br>
 I will 
be kind to others<br>
 - Five Principles of Reiki<br>
</p> 
<p><br>
Thank you to every person who has written to share their experiences 
with Reiki, either on New Year&rsquo;s Eve or elsewhere, or their genuine 
interest to learn more about it. I just wanted to take a moment to share with 
everyone a few resources for those who would like to learn more about Reiki in 
general, to find a practitioner for hands-on healing.<br>
<br>
When asked, many 
people say they aren&rsquo;t sure if they felt anything during their session, 
whether hands-on or distant. This is not unusual. As a recipient of Reiki from 
other people, I always experience a sense of deep relaxation, and usually also 
a sensation of energy in motion, whether as undulating or pulsing waves, or 
warmth traveling from the site of the practitioner&rsquo;s hands to other parts 
of my body. One practitioner sent cool energy from her hands which was still 
deeply relaxing. As a practitioner, I often feel very warm internally (as if 
I&rsquo;ve been doing intense core exercises), and my hands and feet feel very 
cool, although when doing in-person treatments, I&rsquo;m always told my hands 
feel like a heating pad.<br>
<br>
For a description of what you can expect 
during Reiki hands-on treatment, I recommend the book,<em>Reiki: Healing 
Yourself &amp; Others</em>, by Reiki Master Marsha Burack. I chose this book 
for my home library recently because it&rsquo;s beautifully illustrated and 
includes photographs of each Reiki hand placement. On the Web, Reiki Master 
David Herron offers a description of Reiki treatments and the hand positions on 
his site,The Reiki Page.<br>
<br>
For a more clinical description of Reiki, the 
National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine at the National 
Institutes of Health (NIH) provides an introduction to Reiki as it is 
understood by their scientists ontheir site.<br>
<br>
In this scientific vein, 
perhaps one of the most exciting developments about Reiki is its use in 
clinical trials sponsored by the NIH. There are currently 5 different

<h1>Here's Lookin' at You: Garlicky Shrimp in Butter Sauce</h1>  January06 2008
<br> <br>
Taking advantage of the abundant fresh fish and shellfish available 
here, we often turn first to the classics. When it comes to fresh shrimp, few 
things can top this simple preparation often called &quot;scampi&quot; in 
seafood and Italian restaurants: whole shrimp sauteed in garlic oil and spices, 
and finished in a light buttery cream sauce. And when it comes to garlic, the 
highest authority on my shelves is the <em>The Garlic Lovers' Cookbook</em>  
(see book review) by the Gilroy Garlic Festival Association. Gilroy, California 
proudly claims itself the &quot;Garlic Capital of the World&quot; and during 
the last weekend in July for the last 30 years, over one hundred thousand 
visitors to its 3-day festival make it so. The Gilroy Garlic Festival serves up 
everything from its Gourmet Alley classics like calamari salad, garlic bread 
and this scampi, to the more unusual garlic wine, ice cream, chocolates, and 
&quot;mountain oysters.&quot; All profits from the festival go to local 
charities. It's a delicious win-win for everyone. This year the Festival will 
take place July 25-27th  at Christopher Ranch in Gilroy. If you're planning 
your first trip there, a word to the wise: go early, and don't let the garlic 
ice cream be the first thing you try that day! Until you can stroll Gourmet 
Alley for yourself, these finger-lickin' ono shrimp will tide you over.<br>

<h1>Game Day in the Big Easy: Crawfish Etouffee</h1>  January02 2008  Update 
(January 8, 2008): With Paula's permission, her recipe replaces the previous 
version. This is the keeper recipe. Thanks, Paula!<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
New 
Year's Day foods have to be special, even when they're not the traditional 
Japanese fare we usually have ( previous post ). And since we decided to 
postpone making sukiyaki until dad's upcoming visit, something equally special 
had to fill those proverbial shoes. But what? Well, the University of Hawaii 
Warriors were playing in the Sugar Bowl on New Year's Day &mdash;  first time 
ever in this Bowl game &mdash;  and the island was caught up in the excitement 
of this momentous game. The game was in New Orleans so it seemed natural to 
make our favorite dish from the Big Easy &mdash;  Crawfish Etouffee 
(EH-too-fay).<br>
<br>
<br>
I've never been to New Orleans, so everything I 
know about it, I learned in my first bowl of crawfish etouffee &mdash;  It's 
earthy and spicy, and little bit naughty. My dear friend Paula, a Nawlins 
native now residing in Cambridge, Mass., shared her family's recipe for 
etouffee with us when she wanted to introduce us to the joys of crawfish. The 
shellfish in question was already cooked, peeled and frozen -- ready to be 
added to a prepared sauce. This is the only type of crawfish I've ever had, but 
it's pretty darn tasty &mdash;  and the frozen pack is a full pound of solid 
tail meat, no shells. A trick I learned from Paula is to add the frozen 
crawfish unthawed to the simmering sauce so the all-important liquid 
&quot;fat&quot; is added to the sauce too. This will add a lot of flavor to 
your finished dish. (To find crawfish on Oahu, see Honolulu Chinatown  post)<br>
<br>In their native habitat, crawfish are actually small lobster-like 
crustaceans (see drawing on package) similar to langoustines on the Continent, 
and they are wildly popular in Louisiana &mdash;  boiled in a spicy brew in 
vast quantities and eaten from the shell. I've not had the pleasure of this Big 
Easy experience, but until I do, the etouffee will keep us happy.<br>
<br>

PAULA'S CRAWFISH ETOUFFEE<br>
(The real McCoy)<br>
<br>
For the Roux (roo):<br>

3 TBL. butter<br>
3 TBL. flour<br>
<br>
Combine butter and flour in 
heavy-bottomed pan (cast-iron is ideal) and cook on very low heat, stirring 
constantly, for 40 to 50 minutes, or until it achieves a nutty color.<br>
<br>

An internet version says you can skip making the roux because it makes the 
etouffee heavy. This might be true of a short-cooked roux, but the longer a 
roux is cooked, the less binding power it has because the flour is browning and 
losing its glutinous quality. Instead, the long-cooked roux lends a nutty 
flavor and buttery finish that is completely lost if this step is omitted. It's 
worth the time, trust me.<br>
<br>
<br>
2 TBL. EACH oil and unsalted butter<br>

1 medium onion, finely diced (about 3/4 cup, 150g)<br>
1/2 bell pepper, finely 
diced (about 1/2 cup, 85g)<br>
1 large stalk celery, finely diced (about 1/2 
cup, 85g)<br>
3 cloves garlic, minced (about 1 TBL.) <br>
1 cup (160g) minced 
tomatoes<br>
1/4 tsp. salt<br>
1/2 tsp. black pepper<br>
1 TBL. paprika<br>
1 
tsp. thyme leaves<br>
2 bay leaves <br>
1/2 bunch scallions, chopped (about 3/4 
cup, 37g)<br>
1 TBL. Worcestershire sauce <br>
1 TBL.  minced parsley<br>
pinch 
cayenne <br>
1 1/2 cup (375ml) fish or chicken stock <br>
1/2 cup (120ml) dry 
white wine<br>
1 lb. (450g) crawfish tail meat, with fat <br>
<br>
Heat the 
butter/oil in a pan and saute the onion, bell pepper and celery over medium-low 
heat until the onions are translucent, about 10 minutes. Add the garlic, green 
onions, thyme, bay leaves, tomato, parsley, salt, and both peppers. Add stock 
and white wine to the roux and stir to combine, then add to sauce. Bring to a 
boil, then reduce heat to low and simmer for 30 minutes. Add frozen crawfish or 
cleaned tail meat, cover and simmer another 10 minutes or until heated through.
<br><br>
Serve with boiled long-grain rice, and a side of french bread or 
Bruschetta . Hot sauce on the table for the brave. Paula also recommends potato 
salad with this. Now that's good eatin'!!<br>
<br>
<br>
ADDENDUM<br>
I just had 
to share this bit I heard on the morning news about the Warriors game at the 
Superdome. It's a testament to the spirit of Aloha that this state can 
personify.<br>
<br>
Tens of thousands of fans from Hawaii flew out to New 
Orleans for this historic game. Optimism for another win to top off the 
Warriors' undefeated season was raging. Unfortunately, the Georgia Bulldogs 
have a bite nastier than their bark, and the Warriors faced a crushing 10-41 
defeat. Although it seemed clear by the 4th quarter that the Warriors would not 
be able to rally back to win, and despite the late hour (it was after midnight 
CST), the overwhelming majority of Hawaii fans stayed to cheer their team. At 
the game's end, as the team started to leave the field, the fans gave them a 
raucous standing ovation. You could see the surprise light up the team's faces 
as they stopped dead in their tracks to acknowledge the applause. Now <em>that's
</em>  taking care of your ohana (family). In the dark disappointment of the 
night, Hawaii had brought their Warriors . . . a rainbow.<br>

<h1>New Year, New Tastes: Fried Olives</h1>  January02 2008 <br>
<br>
Usually, 
New Year's Day is a day filled with Japanese symbols and foods in our home. 
Maybe it's because it was the one holiday we celebrated when I was growing up 
that was specifically Japanese. Back in the day, Guam's Okinawan, Japanese, and 
other Asian cultures did not have ready access to many of the foodstuffs and 
decorations they would have liked to celebrate the New Year the way it is 
celebrated in their countries of origin. One stand-by that was available for 
the holiday, but often hoarded and in short supply, was fresh mochi, especially 
daifuku (seen here) -- the pillowy soft rice cake filled with sweet beans. In 
later years, grocers started carrying the special ingredients necessary for 
sukiyakc during the holiday season: fresh spinach, shirataki, Japanese leeks, 
paper-thin slices of beef, in addition to the readily available dried shiitake 
and fresh tofu.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
In Japan and places where there is a 
substantial population with Japanese ancestry, it is customary to prepare an 
elaborate and highly-specialized multi-course (as many as 30!) meal called <em>
osechi-ryori</em> ( see photos on bento.com ) during the new year period. <em> 
</em> On Guam this was usually only available at the finest Japanese restaurant 
on the island and ran about $100 per person. Here on Oahu, one can buy the 
ingredients, either raw or already prepared, to prepare this special feast at 
home. Once after I had returned to Guam as an adult, I went to lunch with my 
mother for this special New Year's meal, and just could not appreciate many of 
the strong flavors and unusual foods. After that year, mom went with my aunt 
and other friends. Dinner, though, was still sukiyaki.<br>
<br>
This year T and 
I opted to wait for my dad's visit here in a couple of weeks to make the 
sukiyaki. But to keep the Japanese theme, we had Okinawan kombu  and sekihan 
(adzuki beans and mochi rice) for new year's eve, and we started the new year 
with the traditional Japanese New Year's soup called <em>ozoni</em> , in which 
grilled or steamed plain mochi (no fillings) swims in a light dashi (broth), 
along with some shiitake, greens, and kamaboko (fishcake). This soup (sorry, no 
photos this year) symbolizes long-life and good health for the new year. Some 
people say you should pull the mochi away as you bite it (visualize warm 
mozzarella on a pizza as you take a bite) &mdash;  and the longer the 
&quot;string&quot; of mochi that you pull away, the longer your life. 
Afterwards, we switched gears and enjoyed a rich breakfast of organic french 
roast coffee, sweet rolls, and for me (T left for a hike) pickled eggs and 
sausage.<br>
<br>
<br>
But since we weren't having sukiyaki, what about dinner? 
Well, we picked a New Orleans-style specialty since we were planning to watch 
the UH Warriors play at the Superdome today (tomorrow's post). And we started 
the meal with a new recipe we've been dying to try &mdash;  Italian stuffed and 
fried olives. We first saw these little gems at Rowena's Rubber Slippers in 
Italy  early last month &mdash;  meaty green olives filled with meat and 
cheese, lightly breaded and deep-fried! We both LOVE olives, but had never seen 
such a decadent use of the savory wonders so, of course, it had to be made and 
sampled!<br>
<br>
One thing you should know about me: I hate deep-frying. I 
love deep-fried foods, no question &mdash;  but if I can find someone else to 
do the frying, I'll take the option every time. Tempura, fish and chips, fried 
calamari &mdash;  love them! Don't cook them myself, though. Which is a 
testament to how good these looked and how much we wanted to taste them. On her 
site, Rowena offers tips on slicing the olives for optimal filling (note my 
attempt to follow her directions, not always with success), a recipe for a lamb 
and beef filling, and do-ahead tips for entertaining. I had to substitute 
ground pork and feta, instead of the meats and parmesan specified, due to time 
constraints, but otherwise followed her directions to a &quot;T.&quot; Rowena's 
delectable  Ascolana-style Fried Olives  recipe is here.<br>
<br>
I only made 9 
since it was just us two and they were only supposed to be a precursor to the 
etouffee. Two words: unbelievably ono. We each wolfed down our allotted share 
with thick slabs of sourdough bread, and considered stealing some off our 
spouse. They were everything you think they might be. Maybe more. I think I 
would keep to the parmesan cheese next time &mdash;  the feta was delicious, 
but with the other seasonings used, especially the white wine, I think the 
parmesan will blend better. I have lots more filling and olives to do this 
again on the weekend. I also have some miniature sweet peppers that we will try 
with the same filling and cooking method. Bottom line: this recipe went 
straight in to the Family Favorites folder of my files.<br>
<br>
<br>
UPDATE 
(Jan. 8, 2008): Couldn't resist making more olives over the weekend, as well as 
sweet peppers and mushrooms with the same filling. The mushrooms were stuffed, 
then given a sprinkling of bread crumbs, drizzle of olive oil, and bath of 
chicken broth and sherry (about 1/3 of the way up the mushrooms) and baked. The 
peppers were simply stuffed, drizzled and baked.<br>
<br>
They were all good, 
but I think this filling best suits the briny-ness of the olives. Next time, I 
would add something salty or briny to the remaining filling before using it for 
another vegetable&mdash; perhaps some minced olives or capers, or maybe some 
anchovies. A delicious experiment, nonetheless.<br>
