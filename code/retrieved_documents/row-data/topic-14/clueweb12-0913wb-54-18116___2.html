<p> In our society, many people are convinced that the conventional or 
&quot;Western&quot; way of treating medical ailments is the only way. While in 
the face of illness, it is always good to consult with your general practicing 
physician, it's also good to keep your mind open to other forms of treatment. 
Many Westerners are initially skeptical about the effectiveness of alternative 
medicine, but after giving it a try, are convinced of its amazing health 
benefits.</p> 
<p>If you choose to pursue a career in alternative medicine, you will learn to 
take approaches to illness that are much different from the ones you see on 
primetime TV emergency room dramas. Undeniably, there are a multitude of 
pathways you can take in the field alternative medicine. For instance, you 
might pursue a modality within traditional Chinese medicine, such as 
&quot;cupping,&quot; or you may prefer something completely different. With a 
career in alternative medicine, you are likely to be learning practices that 
have been passed down for centuries, so it is of the utmost important that you 
devote yourself fully to your craft and to your desire to help others. 
Practitioners of alternative medicine believe in the interconnectedness of the 
body. As a result, they do not usually treat individual symptoms, but rather, 
the body as a whole.</p> 
<p>Some practitioners of alternative medicine are employed at spas, while many 
others are self-employed, working from their homes or private offices. 
Additionally, some practitioners of alternative medicine can be found working 
in clinics or hospitals, although this is less common. The field of alternative 
medicine is incredibly diverse, and so are the salaries that alternative 
medicine practitioners can earn.</p>

<h3> Career Specializations</h3> 
<p>Alternative medicine is an incredibly broad career, so there are many 
possibilities for specialization. The following are only a handful:</p> 
<ul> 
<li> <strong>Acupuncturist: </strong>To treat illness and promote general 
health, acupuncturists insert needles into key points on the body. Contrary to 
what one might think, the needles actually serve to lessen pain by stimulating 
nerves, connective tissues, and muscles.&Acirc;&nbsp;</li> 
<li> <strong>Doula:</strong> Since the beginning of human kind, women have 
been having babies outside of hospitals. Actually, some women say that 
childbirth is too momentous of an occasion to be numbed by an epidural while it 
is taking place. For women who would rather bring children into the world in a 
more natural manner, a doula is there to provide support before, during, and 
after birth.&Acirc;&nbsp;</li> 
<li> <strong>Reiki Healer:</strong> A form of alternative medicine that 
originates from 19th century Japan, Reiki healing uses gentle forms of 
non-invasive touches to stabilize the invisible force of energy surrounding 
clients. This form of alternative medicine is meant to reduce stress and 
stimulate the body's natural self-healing abilities.</li> </ul> 
<p>Back to Top</p> 
<h3> Available Degree Levels</h3> 
<ul> 
<li> <strong>Certification:</strong> Completion time varies according to 
program</li> 
<li> <strong>Bachelor's Degree:</strong> 4 years to complete</li> 
<li> <strong>Master's Degree: </strong>2 years to complete</li> 
<li> <strong>Doctoral Degree:</strong> 4-6 year to complete</li> </ul> 
<p>Back to Top</p> 
<h3> Education &amp; Certification</h3> 
<p>The education that will be required of you as a practitioner of alternative 
medicine will largely depend on the type of alternative medicine you want to 
practice and what you want to do with it. Educational requirements range 
anywhere from certification to a doctoral degree. Certification programs are 
available at various specialty schools around the nation and vary in length and 
by the extent of their academic rigor. In addition to certification programs, 
some specialties within alternative medicine expect students to complete 
apprenticeships. Moreover, for those looking to spend many hours studying 
alternative medicine, there is the Doctor of Naturopathic Medicine program to 
strengthen your knowledge of natural healing techniques.</p> 
<p>Importantly, your educational requirements will also vary according to 
where you live. For instance, some states require aspiring acupuncturists to 
become licensed by passing theNational Certification Commission for Acupuncture 
and Oriental Medicine exam.</p> 
<p>Back to Top</p> 
<h3> Salary Information</h3> 
<p>Your annual income in alternative medicine will vary substantially 
according to where you practice, the form of alternative medicine you practice, 
your reputation as a practitioner of alternative medicine, the extent of your 
client base, and your level of experience. According to the U.S. Bureau of 
Labor Statistics (BLS), those working in the &quot;offices of other health 
practitioners&quot; industry (a category that includes practitioners of 
alternative medicine) earned average hourly wages of $19.35 in 2008. (BLS)</p> 
<p>Many practitioners of alternative medicine, especially those in private 
practice, do not accept forms of health insurance as payment for their 
services. As a result, customers are responsible for the entire cost of these 
alternative healthcare services. To save themselves from bankruptcy, private 
practitioners of alternative medicine should only work in communities where 
people can afford to pay out-of-pocket for treatment.</p> 
<p>Back to Top</p> 
<h3> Job Outlook</h3> 
<p>Practitioners of alternative medicine face wide popularity among 
frequenters of spas. For this reason, many jobs exist and will continue to 
exist in the spa industry. In general, practitioners of alternative medicine 
have a positive job outlook because of the increasing attention being paid to 
health in the United States. After hearing that now we have a generation of 
Americans who have a shorter life span than the one before it, Americans have 
become frightened into changing their behavior and habits in order to improve 
their health. As a consequence, they may also be more receptive to alternative 
forms of treatment than they have been in the past.</p> 
<p>The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that employment for the 
&quot;offices of other health practitioners&quot; industry is expected to grow 
by a whopping 41.3 percent over the 2008 to 2018 decade. Considering that the 
predicted growth for all occupations is only 11 percent, practitioners of 
alternative medicine face an incredibly favorable job outlook. Of all 
industries in healthcare, the BLS has predicted that the &quot;offices of other 
health practitioners&quot; industry will experience the second-greatest growth 
in employment over the projection period. (BLS)</p> 
<p>Back to Top</p> 
<h3> Related Careers</h3> 
<p>If you are interested in pursuing alternative medicine, you should also 
think about a career innutrition. With this career, you could have a 
substantial impact on peoples' emotional, mental, and physical health simply by 
changing the type of food they consume. Become a nutritionist, and you could 
eventually help the American population realize that there are plenty of tasty 
foods that are not loaded with butter, sugar, and salt.</p> 
<p>Another career consideration could be in massage therapy. With this career, 
you will use many different hand techniques to release muscle tension, 
stabilize the emotions, and grant serenity to your clients. In order to be a 
successful massage therapist, you should have a thorough understanding of human 
anatomy and be comfortable physically working with a wide variety of peopleTo 
fully prepare for the career, you should complete an accredited massage therapy 
certification program, which will take anywhere from six months to one year to 
complete.</p>
