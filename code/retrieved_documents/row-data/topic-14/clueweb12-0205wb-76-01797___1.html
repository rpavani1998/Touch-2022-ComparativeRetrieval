<h1> How do we work with your medical doctor? </h1> 
<p>There is an old Chinese proverb that goes something like this, &ldquo;There 
are many paths to the top of the mountain, but the view remains the 
same&rdquo;. In Traditional Chinese Medicine, very few people are considered to 
be truly infertile, but are merely imbalanced. At the Natural Fertility Health 
Centers we prefer to see couple&rsquo;s conceive without the use of medications 
and invasive procedures. However, we know that sometimes there are mechanical 
and anatomically organic reasons why a woman will not be able to conceive 
naturally, but through western fertility treatments, can still give birth to 
their own child.</p> 
<p>Those women need to see a reproductive endocrinologist, a western fertility 
doctor. However, our treatments will support you physically, mentally, and 
spiritually through the fertility procedures. In fact, our Integrated Dynamic 
Fertility&trade; program prepares you physically and emotionally for western 
fertility treatments and relieves the side effects of the medications given as 
well as increasing the chances of successful conception and birth by 40% to 
60%. Most of the women we see in our clinic have sought us out after repeated 
failure of ART, the acronym for Assisted Reproductive Technology&mdash;better 
known as Western fertility treatments such as IUI (intra-uterine insemination) 
and IVF (in vitro fertilization) among other treatments.</p> 
<p>We explain to potential patients that they should allow at least 90 days or 
three menstrual cycles (ideally six months, if possible) before they start 
their ART treatments. That way, through the use of safe, effective, natural 
methods, we can balance and harmonize her body&rsquo;s energy, blood and organ 
functions to produce the best ART response. A woman wants to be as hormonally 
balanced, and as physically, mentally, emotionally and spiritually healthy as 
possible before any invasive medical intervention, especially one involving the 
injection of significant amounts of hormones.</p> 
<p>Interestingly enough, many of our patients get pregnant during the three to 
six months before they have their ART procedures. Remember, once the 
woman&rsquo;s underlying root cause for her fertility problems is uncovered and 
dealt with, conception can occur naturally most of the time.</p> 
<p>To further address the process of working with your western physician, we 
send your doctor a letter informing them we are working with their patient. We 
encourage our patients to consult their doctor&rsquo;s before beginning 
treatment with us. But just to ensure coordination of treatments, we send out a 
letter. Most doctors are receptive to our treatments with their patients. In 
fact, we receive quite a few referrals from reproductive endocrinologists. Some 
doctors are interested in our protocols and herbal treatments, and we forward 
to them the details of our formulas. Western trained physicians usually like 
the fact that we focus on stress reduction and help relieve the side-effects of 
their medications and procedures. ART is very stressful physically, mentally, 
emotionally, and spiritually to a woman.</p> 
<p>However, unlike reproductive endocrinologists, we work with you well after 
you have conceived. We continue to treat you through your pregnancy and even 
post-partum. After conception, we work with your OB and/or mid-wife staying in 
touch with them throughout the pregnancy. In fact, our patients&rsquo; doctors 
have remarked on how often our patients have had &ldquo;model 
pregnancies&rdquo; right out of a textbook. This is due to our program of 
keeping a woman&rsquo;s body in balance during the pregnancy. The birth and 
post partum period is generally also medically uneventful, and thus pleasurable 
for the new mom and new dad.</p> <br>
