<h3>What Is Touch for Health Therapy?</h3> 
<p> Posted by admin in Massage on August 7, 2011 </p> 
<p>Changes are part of our lives that we can&rsquo;t stop or alter in the 
course we want them to be. The same goes with our health, it degenerates as we 
grow older each day. The more we age, the more it becomes prone to all sorts of 
sickness and diseases. Our vessel also becomes fragile and weak as the days 
goes by. However, we can slow down the process and fight off illness with 
massage therapy.</p> 
<p>Touch for health is one therapy that is known as a therapeutic massage that 
uses muscle manipulation by testing to find weak muscles. It is known as a 
branch of applied kinesiology designed for ordinary people to understand and 
implement on their family and friends. The techniques used in this type of 
massage therapy are quite simple and easy to learn, understand, and practice. 
Touch for health uses combined knowledge and elements found in Western 
medicine, bodywork, and traditional Chinese medicine. All of these components 
are blended to form a basic type of therapeutic massage that can be utilized 
and enjoyed by anyone who needs to have treatment. The therapy doesn&rsquo;t 
require the learner to be knowledgeable in physical therapy in order to 
understand the techniques.</p> 
<p>The technique uses muscle testing on the affected areas to assess and 
search for weak muscle groups. The practitioner then works on the strong 
muscles surrounding the fragile ones in the goal of strengthening and regaining 
their optimum condition. Muscle testing is constantly performed during the 
massage therapy in order to get a good idea of the progress of the massage 
therapy.</p> 
<p>Its history can be traced to Dr. George Goodheart&rsquo;s discovery on the 
effect and benefits when certain muscles were massaged. He noticed changes in 
the weak and affected muscles whenever he conducts massage works on the strong 
muscles connected to the frail ones. This led to the development of the system 
known today as applied kinesiology.</p> 
<p>The idea though wasn&rsquo;t complete, not until Dr. Goodheart worked with 
John Thie who was also a chiropractor. Both were diligent and determined in 
developing a technique using the idea of applied kinesiology on a simpler level 
that can be understood and learned by everyone. Their goal was to create a 
massage therapy method that can be practiced and conducted by individuals 
without proper training and education on physical therapy. Later on, this 
systematic approach in therapeutic massage education was successfully developed 
and became known as the new kinesiology Touch for Health.</p> 
<p>The therapy session usually begins with the client lying down or sitting on 
somewhere comfortable and relaxing as the practitioner starts with the 
evaluation of the muscles. Although it can also be done while standing, most 
patients prefer to sit down or lay down to avoid discomfort.Read the rest of
