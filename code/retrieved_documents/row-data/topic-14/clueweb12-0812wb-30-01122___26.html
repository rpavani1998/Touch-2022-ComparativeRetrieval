 Spicy debate: RMIT is researching the 
effectiveness of ginseng in improving lung function in patients with Chronic 
Obstructive Pulmonary Disease. Flickr/wparadiso.<br>

<p>RMIT University&rsquo;s School of Health Sciences has rejected the 
suggestion that it peddles pseudo-scientific quackery via its courses in 
complementary and alternative medicine (CAM).</p> 
<p>Acting head of the school Dr Ray Myers has defended RMIT&rsquo;s health 
science programs as &ldquo;evidence-based education and practice&rdquo;, citing 
collaboration in clinical research of CAM treatments funded by theNational 
Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC).</p> 
<p>Dr Myers was speaking in the face of a campaign by a coalition of prominent 
medical researchers to expunge higher education of the &ldquo;undisciplined 
nonsense&rdquo; taught in CAM courses at Australia&rsquo;s &ldquo;somewhat 
lesser universities&rdquo;.</p> 
<p>The campaigning group, Friends of Science in Medicine (FSM), has about 400 
signatories, including immunologist Sir Gustav Nossal and Professor Jock 
Findlay, chairman of the NHMRC&rsquo;s Embryo Research Licensing Committee. It 
has written to every vice-chancellor in Australia asking for a review of their 
health science courses to &ldquo;ensure that primacy is given to scientific 
principles based on experimental evidence&rdquo;. The letter laments the spread 
of chiropractic studies to 19 Australian universities, and complains that 
&lsquo;energy medicine&rsquo;, &lsquo;tactile healing&rsquo;, homeopathy, 
iridology, kinesiology, acupuncture, and reflexology are taught &ldquo;as if 
they were science&rdquo;.</p> 
<p>Group co-founder Emeritus Professor John Dwyer from the University of NSW 
said that FSM wants &ldquo;vice-chancellors to ask their deans of science 
what&rsquo;s the heck&rsquo;s going on &hellip; It&rsquo;s just extraordinary 
that such undisciplined nonsense is being taught in universities around 
Australia.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>&ldquo;One of the complaints that we have about so-called alternative 
medicine is that it doesn&rsquo;t strive to be tested. &hellip; modern medicine 
is totally devoted to doing everything we can to take this evidence-based 
approach and do good science and do good research into the things we do to 
people,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Alternative medicine doesn&rsquo;t do that 
&ndash; it&rsquo;s more than happy to rely on tradition and anecdote and it 
doesn&rsquo;t really want to be tested.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>However, Dr Myers said that CAM research at RMIT was conducted in a 
thoroughly scientific manner, with the NHMRC funding clinical trials of 
alternative medicines. In a clinical study granted A$560,000 by the NHMRC and 
A$30,000 by theNational Institute of Complementary Medicine, the university was 
collaborating with two Melbourne hospitals on a clinical study investigating 
the use of ginseng, a herb used in traditional Chinese medicine, for improving 
lung function in patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), he 
said.</p> 
<p>The NHMRC had also granted A$400,000 for a project in which the university 
was collaborating with three Melbourne hospitals on a three-year clinical trial 
of acupuncture for pain management in emergency departments, Dr Myers said. 
&ldquo;The project follows the promising results of pilot studies by RMIT 
researchers, in which more than 1,000 patients received acupuncture treatment 
for acute pain relief at the emergency department of the Northern 
Hospital.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>The professions of Chinese medicine, chiropractic and osteopathy are 
government regulated, Dr Myers said, with RMIT programs in these fields meeting 
current professional standards and subject to external accreditation. 
Chiropractic and osteopathy were areas in which clinical research was limited, 
but RMIT&rsquo;s education program incorporated the &ldquo;best available 
evidence, while promoting further clinical research into these 
treatments,&rdquo; Dr Myers said. &ldquo;RMIT stands by its long record of 
evidence-based research and the high quality of its health sciences 
programs.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>But FSM is not buying it. &ldquo;Those universities involved in teaching 
pseudoscience give such ideologies undeserved credibility, damage their 
academic standing and put the public at risk,&rdquo; the group&rsquo;s letter 
states.</p> 
<p>The great danger, said Professor Dwyer, was that people who have chronic 
health problems or who have been persuaded that doctors do not have the answers 
are delaying the &ldquo;proper investigation and treatment&rdquo; of their 
illness by instead seeking help from therapists offering alternative medicine.
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;These are dangerous delusions, and our campaign at the moment is 
aimed at those somewhat lesser universities, but nonetheless universities, that 
are offering and teaching pseudoscience as if there was an evidence base to 
support it, because obviously that gives credibility in the eye of the 
public,&rdquo; Professor Dwyer said.</p> 
<p>Citing the late CEO of Apple, Professor Dwyer said that &ldquo;Steve Jobs 
spent a year with his cancer of the pancreas trusting homeopathic remedies, and 
by the time he got to the surgeons it was all over.&rdquo; It is worth noting 
the veracity ofthis claim by Professor Edzard Ernst about Mr Jobs treating his 
cancer with homeopathy has left somestruggling to find evidence for it, while 
others have claimed that for nine months after his diagnosis, Mr Jobs spurned 
what could have been life-saving surgery in favour of not homeopathy buta vegan 
diet and herbal remedies.</p> 
<p>The &ldquo;lesser universities&rdquo; that have aroused the ire of FSM 
include the Australian Catholic University, Charles Sturt University, Central 
Queensland University, Edith Cowan University, Macquarie University, Monash 
University, Murdoch University, RMIT University, Southern Cross University, 
Swinburne University, the University of Ballarat, the University of New 
England, the University of Newcastle, the University of Queensland, the 
University of Technology Sydney, the University of Western Sydney, and the 
University of Wollongong. To buttress its case, FSM has gathered a list of 
offending courses, which includes Chinese Medicine, Wellness studies, Applied 
Eastern Anatomy, Clinical Science with options to study osteopathy and 
naturopathy, Mind/Body Medicine, and many others.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;It should be a policy that all universities, higher education 
institutions, should not be involved in in this woolly teaching,&rdquo; 
Professor Dwyer said, adding that &ldquo;I suspect that these are well 
attended, popular, money-earning courses for cash-strapped universities.&rdquo;
</p> 
<p>The claims of FSM, however, ignore the evidence about CAM in higher 
education, said Dr Wardle, a NHMRC Research Fellow at the University of 
Queensland&rsquo;s School of Population Health and co-director of the Network 
of Researchers in Public Health and Complementary and Alternative Medicine (
NORPHCAM), an international group promoting clinical research in CAM.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re actually not that interested in evidence, because the 
overwhelming evidence is that putting CAM into universities has increased the 
standards, decreased the fringe element, and improved public safety, so it 
definitely smacks of dogmatism,&rdquo; said Dr Wardle, who is a naturopath.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;They love to say that there&rsquo;s no such thing as complementary 
medicine and conventional medicine, there&rsquo;s just evidence-based and 
non-evidence-based, but, for example, St John&rsquo;s Wort for over a decade 
now has been shown to be equally as effective as any pharmaceutical indication 
for mild to moderate depression, yet there&rsquo;s still a large group of 
doctors who refuse to integrate it simply because it&rsquo;s a herbal 
medicine,&rdquo; Dr Wardle said.</p> 
<p>The world of CAM is not a &ldquo;homogenous entity&rdquo;, said Dr Wardle. 
&ldquo;There is a lot of crap, but there&rsquo;s good stuff, and treating it 
like it&rsquo;s all the same thing is very, very fraught. Taking it out of 
universities runs a real risk of the fringe element getting a stronger voice in 
the profession.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>&ldquo;There are studies from Canada, Australia, and Britain that show that 
CAM practitioners are less anti-vaccination when they&rsquo;re university 
trained, and they refer more to conventional [medical] providers when things 
get serious if they&rsquo;re university trained.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>&ldquo;If you look at chiropractic courses [in universities], most of it is 
human physiology. Chiropractic is certainly not the dominant part of the 
course. If you look at naturopathy, they do learn herbal medicine and nutrition 
but they also learn basic health science: they learn the common language of 
health practice &ndash; they learn what a physio or a medical doctor or a nurse 
would learn. Putting it into the universities diminishes the fringe 
element,&rdquo; Dr Wardle said. &ldquo;If they [FSM] are really worried about 
public safety they should be not trying to exclude and ostracise them from the 
university sector.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>He questioned how representative FSM&rsquo;s roll call of doctors really 
is, saying that he has just completed a survey of every rural GP in NSW and 
qualitative interviews with about 30. &ldquo;About a third wouldn&rsquo;t have 
anything to do with complementary medicine providers, another third were very 
open to it &ndash; maybe too open &ndash; and the other third if they knew a 
practitioner who got results they&rsquo;d send people on.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>About 70 per cent of Australians use CAM and it thus makes sense for 
research and training to be carried out within the regulation and scientific 
rigour of the universities, Dr Wardle said.</p>

<p>Theories in all disciplines are refined and refuted all the time. The issue 
is whether the only valid or rational ground for knowledge is empirical. Since 
human health involves many factors which cannot (yet) be understood empirically 
studies of human health should include non empirical methods.</p> 
<p>Disciplines which are not empirical are not necessarily anti empirical or 
anti science and still less are they are pseudo science since they don't 
pretend to be science - quite the contrary. This is in stark contrast to many 
theologians who of course are virulently anti science.</p> <br>

<p>I was approached by this lobby group to support its efforts, but requested 
clarification from it on how it defined ''pseudo science''. I pointed out that 
if it did not have a tight and usable definition of pseudo science its efforts 
would be wasted.</p> 
<p>Most alternative health practitioners use evidence-based science in terms 
of observation, intervention, and adjustments in response to the outcome of the 
intervention. As such they would happily claim that their activities entirely 
align with the demand for evidence-based science.</p> 
<p>If the definition of evidence-based science was one that required 
double-blind trials then much of what is taught in medicine itself could be in 
danger of being classified as pseudo-science.</p> 
<p>The lobby group did not respond to my inquiry - perhaps suggesting that its 
members had not sufficiently thought through this issue.</p>

danger of being classified as pseudo-science.&quot;</p> 
<p>This makes sense because double-blind trials i.e. hiding the nature of the 
treatment from both the patient and doctor are often impossible in biomedical 
treatments. . This is certainly true of chemotherapy tests, where the side 
effects make it impossible to 'hide' the nature of the treatment from doctors. 
Increasingly patients too are aware of the side effects of particular drugs. So 
even single-masking cannot be achieved.</p> <br>

<p>Like Western medicine, Chinese medicine has also evolved from thousands of 
years of intuition, trial and error, serendipity, case studies, scholarly 
advances, experiments etc. Chinese medicine is now being found efficacious in 
numerous trials designed with the same adherence to the current standards as 
used in Western medicine research. (These Chinese medicine trials are often 
carried out by Universities).</p> 
<p>Even though both systems are radically different, Western medicine and 
Chinese medicine should both be considered valid ways of treating illness and 
improving health.</p> 
<p>At this point in time wouldn't it be better to at least continue to apply 
the formal scientific method to test Chinese Medicine, rather than completely 
abandon this whole medical system?</p> <br>

<p>Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) is not a static body of medical 
knowledge. It incorporates systematic forms of evaluation which support 
innovation. In this sense, systematic clinical evaluation is already embedded 
in TCM practice. Critical here are clinical records and possibilities for 
developing new schools of practice.</p> 
<p>This type of clinical evaluation that is embedded in TCM practice is 
undertaken by employing the Four Examination Techniques 'Si Zhen' as a clinical 
evaluation template or tool. Instead of using the Four Examination Techniques 
of observing, listening/smelling, palpating and inquiring to gather clinical 
data for eventual diagnosis, the Four Examination Techniques undergo 
transformation into the Four Evaluation Techniques 'Si Ping' to observe, 
palpate, listen / smell, and interrogate clinical symptoms and signs for data 
to evaluate the efficacy of administered therapy. This data gathered by the 
Four Evaluation Techniques is then checked , examined, verified and compared 
with data on clinical signs and symptoms collected and recorded in the medical 
case record during the previous visit. Using the Four Evaluation Techniques , 
the clinical pattern is revisited or retraced to evaluate whether the therapy 
achieved the aim of bringing about balance or harmony. Hence, every subsequent 
visit or consultation is a process of evaluation of the therapy administered 
during the previous visit. During those visits, presenting symptoms or signs 
are used as indicators of efficacy of the therapy administered. As one veteran 
TCM practitioner summed up in 1983:<br>
&quot; Changes which occur in the 
patient's condition after the administration of the therapeutic remedy is the 
clear mirror which tests the efficacy of the practitioner's formula set on the 
basis of the therapeutic method. Hence, with regards the results of the 
therapy, they should be timely evaluated and verified... there should be 
follow-up visits, all-round investigation as well as detailed records 
kept.&quot;</p> 
<p>As we can see from above, there is already a suitable clinical evaluation 
model that can be used in assessing the efficacy of TCM therapies. There is no 
need to use the formal scientific method of the Randomized Controlled Trial 
(RCT) to test the efficacy of these therapies.</p> <br>

<p>As a practitioner of both CAM and western medicine I feel that some of the 
academics responding to the argument of whether Alternative Medicine should be 
taugh at universities, have lost view of the big picture of what medicine is 
all about, by instead focussing their arguments on what entails scientific 
evidence based research.<br>
The reason we practice medicine in whatever form 
or research in medically related fields, should be to relieve human suffering 
by providing relief of disease and its symptoms by using a method that is most 
effective, least invasive, most humane, cost effective and producing the least 
unwanted side effects.<br>
The only way to surely do this is to take from both 
sides of medicine the treatment that meets best meets the immediate and long 
term needs of the patient.<br>
Nobody doubts that concentrated Western drugs or 
invasive surgery is nneded and appropropriate when someone needs instant pain 
relief or acute life saving treatment (e.g. anaphylaxis, AMI or major trauma). 
This is where I see the full effect of what the advances in western medicine 
can do in my role as an Advanced Care Paramedic.<br>
However I also feel 
extremely frustrated when I see people suffering from chronic or acute 
illnesses such as sequel to CVA, endometriosis, infertility, fibromyalgia, 
chronic fatigue, pain from injury, chronic headaches, etc, for which they have 
not been able to get relief from using the treatments currently available to 
western medicine, and for which CAM has highly effective long term treatments 
that return quality of life to the patient<br>
As recommended by the World 
Health Organization, countries around the world should be incorporating both 
CAM and western medicine into hospitals as well as out of hospital setting, 
using the best mix of therapies to suit each individual case.<br>
Neither 
medicine has all the answers and neither should they claim too, the community 
will make their own decision in the long run as to which modality of medicine 
they choose to put their faith and dollars into, we should definitely encourage 
medicine research in both areas through increased availability of university 
course to improve the health of everyone.<br>
Before researchers and scientists 
make these fraudulent claims that CAM does not conduct evidence based research, 
look at why indemnity insurance is so massive for western medco's and not for 
CAM practitioners. Western medicine is responsible for hundreds of thousands of 
iatrogenic injuries and deaths per year while CAM is only implicated in a 
handful.</p> <br>

<p>My career in CAM spans 25 years and i&acute;m an ex herbalist.I&acute;m

<p>This issue is pretty clear.It is fundamentally about honesty.Science is the 
best way we have to determine reality:We either value the ways we proceed to 
determine what is true or we have a recipe for chaos.It is by strict adherence 
to theses principles that we make worthwhile discoveries that benefit us 
all.It&acute;s because scientists have have tested the honesty of their ideas 
against one another that we've all come to enjoy the benefits of their 
work.That&acute;s how we progress.<br>
It&acute;s that honesty that i see 
sorely lacking on the CAM side.But it nevertheless wants to be treated 
seriously.What it effect you are saying is<br>
-we can't determine that these 
energy meridians and qi exist,despite the extraordinary technologies at our 
disposal but the Chinese have been saying so,so it must be true.<br>
-water is 
magic and holds memory.<br>
-sublaxations are the cause of disease <br>
-humans 
can channel universal energy and heal but we can't measure it ..etc etc.<br>

What i see is an industry hell bent on holding on to its pet pre-scientific 
theories despite its inability to prove them.It smacks of arrogance, 
intellectual dishonesty and lots of cognitive dissonance.I'm not<br>
 sure why 
its practitioners persist in maintaining these daft ideas.It's the 21st century.
</p> 
<p>Time to face the facts.The data is coming in and its not looking good.It's 
clearly showing that what we do is not much better than placebo.So the question 
is do we have the humility to accept the evidence and dump these theories.I 
doubt it.<br>
Have any major advances been made in altmed in the last 20 years? 
Not that I've seen.Instead i see a proliferation of woos that are quite frankly 
embarrassing,such as &quot;quantum reflex analysis&quot; or &quot;homeopathy 
for domestic violence&quot;.And CAM expects to be taken seriously...<br>
Have i 
seen the industry contest or reject its own stupidities like live blood 
analysis or &quot;detoxing&quot; when it can't name one toxin that its methods 
supposedly detox.No,it embraces them instead.<br>
I would suggest that CAM 
suffers from a terrible case of immaturity.It wants to be accepted by the big 
league through appeals to antiquity,to other ways of knowing and to special 
treatment.<br>
Universities are the places to test these ideas not teach 
them.The teaching of these theories as valid science only serves to dumb 
everyone down.And that's not a good thing.</p>

<p>I think belief in a Deity is perfectly justified, and I believe having a

<p>With regards to your criticism of acupuncture, let it be said that 
&quot;qi&quot; is not some mystical magical quackery, it is a universal 
principle analogous to the principle of &quot;force&quot; in physics. Imagine 
if we were to say, &quot;we've been looking with our own two eyes and we still 
haven't seen any of this so-called 'force' you physicists keep banging on 
about&quot;. Such a statement would be ludicrous. And so is your statement 
about qi.</p> 
<p>As for energy meridians, well I posted a link to a meta-review here down 
the page that finds very suggestive evidence into the electro-conductivity 
properties of meridians, exactly as predicted in TCM. Now, true, these are just 
preliminary findings, and there is still more research to do, but to imply that 
we've conductive exhaustive research and haven't found ANYTHING is devious and 
deceptive. In fact we've found very promising preliminary results that are 
extremely suggestive of the exact phenomenon that we acupuncturists already 
knew existed all along anyway.</p> <br>

<p>Well actually Rachael, its a philosophical speculation that I make my on

concepts of ancient TCM into modern scientific understanding, because I believe 
the old Taoists had valid insights. Starting from a viewpoint of curiosity and 
earnestness, as opposed to scepticism and dismissal, I make a genuine effort to 
understand such teachings in a realistic context.</p> 
<p>For example, it is said in TCM that &quot;heart qi&quot; is what causes the 
blood to circulate around the body. &quot;Nonsense&quot; the sceptics refute, 
&quot;its the heart itself which causes blood to circulate, not some magical 
make-belief woo-woo bullshit which doesn't exist!&quot;</p> 
<p>But actually, thinking scientifically, we can see that its NOT the heart 
that directly causes blood circulation. Actually, the pumping mechanism of the 
heart generates kinetic force, and it is this kinetic force which causes the 
circulation of blood in the vessels. So we can see that if we take the concept 
of &quot;qi&quot; to mean force, then it is quite correct to say that 
&quot;heart qi&quot; causes the blood to circulate.</p> 
<p>I am also a practitioner of kung fu Chinese Martial arts, and a lot of what 
we learn involves learning to use our body and our breath in order to generate 
maximum force for our strikes. Its all very practical pragmatic stuff, but in 
the ancient texts it talks about generating &quot;qi&quot;. In reality, that 
just means generating force to be expressed as powerful kicks and punches.</p> 
<p>There are myriad more examples. Taoist astronomers would say that it was 
the &quot;qi&quot; of the heavens that made them move as they did. This is like 
Newton's force of gravity. Qi was never meant to mean some mystical energy 
glowing blue or green that can animate spirits or anything in my opinion, it 
always was and still is a principle that implies a similar meaning to the 
scientific concept of force.</p>

<p>Hi Richard</p> 
<p>Far from closing my mind,i opened it up to the possibility that I might be 
wrong in my certitude on subjects that are terribly uncertain.It has made me 
see that CAM is built on a foundation of logical fallacies and until it rids 
itself of those fallacies it remains pseudoscience.<br>
I like to remind myself 
that minds much greater than my own laid the ground rules with which we measure 
reality.<br>
I also like to remind myself that thousands of people spend 
countless hours ,in obscurity, trying to find answers,using those very 
principles that CAM so often dismisses as not being applicable to itself.</p>

<p>The problem as I see it is indoctrination of mainstream medical 
establishments. If you listen they all seem to have the same responses to any 
arguments that are pro-CAM.<br>
If you go back to the beginnings of allopathic 
medicine, you find that Rockefeller invested huge amounts of money in medical 
schools, which no doubt was on the principle of &quot;spend a penny, to make a 
buck&quot; basis. And it sure has paid off for pharmaceutical medicine.</p> <br>

<p>&quot;Allopathy&quot; was a term of abuse invented by Hannemann, long 
before there were Rockefellers. What US millionaires did in the US in the 20's 
has little relevance to the rise of scientific medicine (the Pharmaceutical

originally herbal medicine suppliers).</p> <br>

<p>Today's conventional medicine is known as allopathic as the treatments 
oppose the symptoms - antibiotics kill the bacteria, insecticides kill the 
parasites, fungicides kill the fungus, chemo kills the cancer cells. 
Alternative aims to rebuild the immune system so the body can fight off these 
invaders itself.<br>
Modern medicine is a racket that began in the 1800s with 
the likes of rockefellers and AMA which have taken a dominance due to their 
approach to ridicule and rule out whatever competes with them. What was started 
back in 1800s still continues with the suppression of certain ideas and 
practices.</p> <br>

Abstract <br>

BACKGROUND:<br>
Dietary sources of alpha-linolenic acid, such as perilla seed 
oil, may have the capacity to inhibit the generation of leukotrienes (LTs) by 
leucocytes in patients with asthma, as has been reported with the consumption 
of other long-chain n-3 fatty acids.<br>
METHODS: <br>
The factors affecting 
the suppression of leukotriene (LT) C4 generation by leucocytes were examined 
by comparing the clinical features of patients with asthma who had been given 
dietary perilla seed oil (n-3 fatty acids). Group A consisted of patients in 
whom the leucocyte generation of LTC4 was suppressed by dietary perilla seed 
oil. Group B consisted of those in whom LTC4 generation was not suppressed.<br>

RESULTS:<br>
LTC4 generation by leucocytes decreased significantly in group A 
after 2 (p &lt; 0.05) and 4 weeks (p &lt; 0.05); conversely, it increased 
significantly in group B after 4 weeks (p &lt; 0.05). The two study groups 
differed significantly in terms of LTC4 generation by leucocytes after 4 weeks 
of dietary supplementation (p &lt; 0.05). Ventilatory parameters such as peak 
expiratory flow (PEF), forced vital capacity (FVC) and forced expiratory volume 
in 1 s (FEV(1)) increased significantly after 4 weeks of dietary 
supplementation in group A (p &lt; 0.05). Values of PEF, FVC, FEV(1) and 
maximum expiratory flow at 25% of the forced vital capacity (V(25)) differed 
significantly between groups A and B prior to dietary supplementation. Serum 
levels of total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and 
phospholipid were significantly decreased by dietary supplementation in group A 
after 4 weeks. Serum levels of total cholesterol, triglyceride, high-density 
lipoprotein cholesterol, LDL cholesterol and phospholipid differed 
significantly between the two study groups prior to dietary supplementation. 
Serum levels of triglyceride and LDL cholesterol differed significantly between 
the two study groups after 4 weeks of dietary supplementation.<br>
CONCLUSIONS: 
<br>Dietary supplementation with perilla seed oil in selected patients with 
asthma suppresses the generation of LTC4 and is associated with clinical 
features such as respiratory function and lipometabolism.</p> <br>

<p>Those making accusations about the profits of Big Pharma might want to 
consider a couple of things.</p> 
<p>1) Big Pharma make a lot of the supplements so in some cases they are 
supplying the supplements which you think come from some warm and fuzzy place 
at the end of a rainbow</p> 
<p>2) What about the ~$2.5 billion / year Big CAM industry in Australia? 
Consider the turnover of a company like Brauer Natural Medicine who sell 
distilled water and sugar pills for an exorbitant mark-up. And without the need 
for R&amp;D or clinical trials or ethics in that case - recall homeopathic 
vaccinations for meningococcol disease? That.</p> 
<p>And consider the outlay of Big Pharma in R&amp;D, licensing fees to the 
TGA, post-launch monitoring, continual safety assessments. All stuff Big CAM 
don't have to do. They just make something up on the ARTG, pay a thousand 
bucks, their product gets rubber stamped with an AustL number and we're away! 
Cha-king!</p>

practice needs a public health warning in of itself. I sat through his 
appallingly inaccurate 2 hour presentation about 12 months ago and was shocked 
by the unadulterated nonsense being spouted from his computer screen. Despite 
being instructed to remove the presentation from his website following a 
complaint to the CCNSW, it re-appeared again recently. I believe a second 
complaint has now been submitted but in the meantime, the information remains 
available along with a presentation called &quot;18 reasons to not 
vaccinate&quot;. And during a time when Aust remains in the grips of a whooping 
cough epidemic? Disgraceful.</p> 
<p>This is why this discussion needs to and should be taking place. Why do 
chiros such as Weiner (and there are many others - just take a cursory look at 
Google) have anti-vaccine leanings? Is this somehow infiltrated into their 
courses? Perhaps there is something in the degree at Macquarie (which is where 
he studied) that allows this unscientific and frankly public health risk 
thinking be nurtured. What is wrong with looking? And if we find there are no 
issues then all is good and dandy!</p> 
<p>My interpretation of the FSM policy documents are not to instigate a flame 
thrower over CAM (as someone else described it), but to examine the current 
courses, look for evidence based practice and modalities and encourage the 
removal of those for which there is no evidence. For example, subluxations 
which even chiros now say (cautiously) don't exist.</p> 
<p>The reaction from the CAM peeps on this issue just being raised (I mean 
seriously people, this is not government policy about to be introduced) is to 
behave like they are being persecuted.</p> 
<p>I work in science, specifically in MND research. If a review of my research 
or the direction I was heading took place and it was deemed I was off track, I 
would be happy to correct for this. Indeed MND is not a bad example as it 
happens, since for the last 20 years the largest body of research has focussed 
on genes but now we see that it's more complicated than that and a move towards 
a gene-environment interaction is being explored.</p> 
<p>Similarly, my colleagues worked on antioxidants as an intervention for 
heart disease for decades only to admit after several large scale trails that 
actually they really didn't have much benefit. Science is self correcting in 
this manner.</p> 
<p>This is why I think this is a good conversation to have and I applaud FSM 
for taking the plunge.</p>

Complementary Therapies (FACT) and funded by the HRI and the Institute for

<p>Post script, I have been unable to find any universities that do in fact 
teach homeopathy as stand alone course. If anyone knows of any I would 
appreciate a reply.</p> 
<p>I would also add that I support the teaching of CAM in a comparative and 
critical thinking manner so that practitioners are equipped with the skills to 
analyse whether a product is evidence based. I would encourage universities to 
direct their teaching in this direction rather than uncritical presentation of 
CAM. And this includes the continuation of research into natural medicines etc 
where appropriate. And when I say where appropriate I mean where a potential 
lies for efficacy, thus eliminating modalities such as homeopathy.</p>

<p>Hi Rachael, <br>
Unfortunately, in my opinion mainstream medicine has come 
under the influence to some extent of pharmaceutical propaganda and 
misinformation. So to make broad sweeping statement that a certain altie has 
got it all wrong, isn't a good idea, because conventional medicine has got a 
lot wrong as well. You might think there is strength in numbers, and that 
because most people believe something that is taught as standard practice in 
mainstream medical schools, makes it true. This is incorrect.</p> <br>

Conventional isn't all right and CAM isn't all wrong. 
Conventional allopathic medicine rails against CAM but shouldn't because there 
are so many diseases that conventional has no cure for and often the best 
drug-based medicine can do is ease a person's suffering.<br>
Scientific studies 
are up to 90% flawed and peer review is no more reliable than a throw of the 
dice. Antibiotics are touted as one of allopathic's miracle wonders, attributed 
to saving many lives, yet in a way this is a fraud because CAM has nutritional 
remedies / cellsalts which can also cure infections but its effectiveness has 
been kept under wraps. Why? Not because it doesn't work though.</p> <br>

<p>Antibiotics have proven effectiveness in saving lives and reducing 
morbidity. There is no good evidence that either nutritional remedies or salts 
have any effect on survival in bacterial infections, or reducing the incidence 
or duration of bacterial infections (there is some weak evidence that cranberry 
juice might have a preventative effect for urinary tract infection in young, 
but not elderly women, but this still requires more evidence).</p> 
<p>This sentence from a popular site talking about cell salts is dnagerously 
wrong.&quot;Cell salts do not react with medications because they are supplying 
minerals on a cellular level.&quot;<br>
Potassium containing salts will 
certainly interact with potassium sparing diuretics, angiotenisn converting 
enzyme inhibitors (possibly fatally) and digoxin, as they also operation on 
mineral at a cellular level. This</p> <br>

<p>Yes, antibiotic proven effectiveness is well known pharmaceutical 
intervention that saves lives, sure. But there are nutritional cellsalt 
remedies that are not so well known. Is this really surprising that nutritional 
cures aren't well known as pharmaceutical solutions?<br>
I can eliminate 
infections, parasites and fungi with cellsalts but this information is 
carefully hidden because the moment it becomes mainstream you can kiss 
pharmaceutical profits goodbye. This comes down to the competing schools of 
thought between the germ theory and the soil theory. In the 1800s there were 
some top scientists (bechamp, virchow) who thought the internal milieu / 
environment was more important than the germs, and as long as it was in good 
nick the person had natural immunity. However, the budding pharmaceutical 
business decided to run with pasteur's germ theory. I wonder why?</p> <br>

<p>It's not that they are not known, it's that there is NO GOOD EVIDENCE that 
they work. There is no good evidence that &quot;Schuessler cell salts&quot; do 
anything to bacterial infections.</p> 
<p>Strangely enough, we have learnt a thing or two about infections since the 
1800's, Pasteur's germ theory was established well before we had the first 
effective antibiotics in the 1950's (well, there were the sulphonamides in the 
late 30's, but they were limited in scope).</p> 
<p>Ironically, drug companies don't like antibiotics because there is not a 
big enough profit in them.</p> <br>

&quot;Rockefeller&rsquo;s great generosity was aimed largely at medical 
education, perhaps because of his father&rsquo;s career and its peculiar 
contributions to medicine. J.D.Rockefeller, being a high school dropout, was 
not well-suited to his new role as godfather of the country&rsquo;s centres for 
higher learning. His philanthropy was permeated with extremely racist views. In 
1901, the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research was created. In 1902, the 
General Education Board (GEB) began four decades of tremendously controversial 
influence over American schools and universities.&quot;<br>
When was old man 
rockefeller selling his snake oil medicine, made from petrol supposedly to 
treat cancer and anything else? He was in the pharmaceutical business, and 
probably worked out that he could only sell his useless remedies to so many 
people before they started to wake up, so got some better remedies that worked. 
When I say better, pharmaceutical drugs are what is called allopathic (they 
oppose the symptoms). Allopathic remedies aren't holistic and not good in the 
long run, but they are profitable.</p> <br>

<p>If nutritional remedies weren't put so much on the backfoot, this knowledge 
would be more available. You mean you want some sort of scientific evidence 
that cellsalts cure infections, fungi and parasites? Where am I going to find 
that -- well not in your dumbed-down institutes of medical learning, that's for 
sure.<br>
The rockefellers and their ilk, industrial robber barrons of the 19th 
century are responsible for cornering the market on things such as transport, 
oil, medicine, education, manufacturing etc. Anybody who tries to compete 
either gets incorporated into their outfit or eliminated. The rockefellers are 
the main example I suppose regarding medicine, but others include morgans, 
rothchilds, not sure of others - need to look it up. But what they started back 
in 19th century continues on today, it is an industrial medical monopoly that 
doesn't like competition and does what it can to talk it down and eliminate it.

<p>You keep using that figure and I have pointed out it is wrong. In Ionnadies 
original studies it wasn't even anywhere near 50% let alone 90%, and that was 
for cutting edge reports NOT all science (and most of them were gene chips, so 
it's not surprising that later, improved methods could find different effects).
</p> 
<p>But again, that's the strength of science, we don't accept these reports at 
face vaule but test them. Unlike CAM, which doesn't try and systematically 
tests their work.</p> <br>

<p>Well Ian, my mistrust of scientific studies goes back to the reports the 
public often gets in the newspapers where one year eggs are bad for you, then a 
few years on they're good.<br>
Other such studies as well. And then I see that 
the evidence-based culture is one where people can't even come up with a ball 
park figure on anything without consulting a study. So if you have study which 
says black is white and vice versa, the inclination is to go along with it and 
say, &quot;Oh, it is placebo that we see white as white, it is really 
black&quot; etc.<br>
I think the public are entitled to try things out for 
themselves without interventional of EBM telling them what is good for them and 
what isn't. I think its all a big con designed to eliminate people's free 
choice and railroad them into pharmaceutical products.</p> <br>

<p>The general public read about studies done by this and that institution 
showing eggs are bad one week then ok in a couple of years time. There is a lot 
of this sort of thing to the extent that the public often take studies with a 
grain of salt. And so I bring to this discussion my experience as a member of 
the public, along with the Ioannidis findings that many if not most studies, 
are flawed.<br>
I just get sick and tired of hearing about studies done for 
this and that. The studies that are done often don't prove a real lot and are 
in exclusive rarified topics often, while the incidence of chronic ill health 
continue to increase.</p> <br>

<p>&quot;Ioannidis [researcher who discovered studies were up to 90% flawed] 
was unusually well prepared to enter medical research: he had been a math 
prodigy of near-celebrity status in high school and both of his parents were 
physician-researchers. He believed he would be able to follow his parents 
footsteps and use math to better support findings in a surprisingly sloppy 
field. &quot;I assumed that everything we physicians did was basically right, 
but now I was going to help verify it,&quot; he said. &quot;All we'd have to do 
was systematically review the evidence, trust what it told us, and then 
everything would be perfect.&quot;</p> 
<p>&quot;It didn't turn out that way. When he pored over medical journals, 
Ioannidis was struck by how many findings of all types were later refuted and 
he was shocked at the range and reach of the reversals in everyday medical 
research.&quot;</p> <br>

<p>What constitutes good or bad information is a bit subjective Rachael. I was 
just coming to the conclusion that Ian is repetitive and wrong on many things, 
and in fact reminds me of the typical skeptic type with biased outlooks. So be 
a pet and don't tell me what is good and what is bad, and who needs to learn 
what. I can't see any skeptic types learning anything, just the same old mantra 
about everything needing to be scientifically tested even although the tests 
are often wrong and prove very little. You talk about la la la, that is your 
attitude I'm afraid to learning anything about alternative medicine. Anybody 
who denies that homeopathy works obviously needs to brush up on their history.

I had a bit of a look for his website, which I didn't

vaccinations. Now for skeptics to try to suppress alternative information isn't 
good, whatever the pretext. We don't know that the general overall health of 
vaccinated is as good as unvaccinated. Anecdotal reports from some sources 
suggest that unvaccinated have better immune systems generally.<br>
The 
failures of vaccination are inclined to be kept hidden, and apparently there 
are a few including possible autism cases and other auto-immune diseases.<br>

Regarding the 90% fallacy, I believe it was &quot;up to 90% wrong&quot;. You 
say this figure has been refuted. Well of course it has because the mainstream 
medicine couldn't afford to let it stand as it is one of the cornerstones of 
modern medicine.</p> <br>

<p>Which is not the same thing as saying &quot;...a certain altie has got it 
all wrong&quot;. I specifically cited his vaccination information. I did not 
mention his chiropractic information. I'm sorry Carol, but your propensity to 
misquote me. cite anecdotes as evidence and drift off into conspiracy time and 
time again precludes me from having a worthwhile discussion with you.</p> 
<p>If you don't understand why false information about vaccination is

<p>Yes Rachael, it is dangerous to put out disinformation on vaccination in 
some ways. However, the truth also needs to be addressed.<br>
Vaccination may 
help prevent the diseases for which a person is vaccinated for, however, 
overall there is a theory that they have undesirable side effects generally on 
a person's overall health, many people developing auto-immune diseases. In some 
countries where there is a very low standard of living vaccinations can save 
lives, but the better solution is to improve nutrition. I've done some research 
and find that there are two conflicting sides of the story, one being put out 
by those aligned with pharmaceutical medicine, and the other by anti-vaxxers, 
often parents of kids who have seen deterioration with their own eyes.</p> <br>

<p>I don't think there have been any studies done to compare the overall 
health of vaccinated to unvaccinated. Today's children are more prone to 
various auto-immune diseases such as allegies and asthma. There are certain 
reports of children who's health takes a backward step after vaccination, 
reported by parents. I just don't think the science is there to say that 
vaccinations don't cause any side effects or lowering in overall health.<br>

The theory that infectious childhood diseases were eliminated solely by 
vaccination isn't really true. Apparently sanitation had a lot to do with it as 
well as improved nutrition. Often there are outbreaks of disease due to 
vaccination, if you read some reports, not just those cherry picked by 
conventional sources wishing to paint a rosy picture.</p> <br>

<p>There is no way that vaccinated would have better health over unvaccinated. 
This is to imply that vaccination has some overall benefit apart from the 
disease it vaccinates against. So this study would be one of the faulty ones. 
How many people were tested, and was the study done by vested interests.<br>

What there needs to be done is a large scale study showing vaccinated children 
to be as healthy as unvaccinated. Because at the moment there is a suspician 
that while vaccination prevents one disease (that which it is vaccinated for) 
it causes other diseases, such as various auto-immune diseases (allergies, 
asthma, autism etc).<br>
I think the jury is out on this one Ian, and no matter 
how much denial you want to go into, just saying that vaccinations are safe 
isn't good enough given that the causes of so many auto-immune diseases are on 
the increase and without any known causes ie Vaccination has to be considered 
as a possible cause.</p> <br>

<p>As a signatory to the petition calling for the axing by universities of 
homeopathy, naturopathy, chiropractic and other courses based on pseudo-science 
I am shocked that any learned institution would teach gibberish alongside 
mainstream courses. But at the same time I support courses that apply the 
blow-torch of scientific rigour and evidence-based medicine to when teaching 
herbal medicine, as at the University of Sydney. Many very useful drugs are 
based on natural chemicals found in plants. And 'St Johns wort' is the correct 
answer to a question in our bank of exam questions at Sydney Medical School on 
the best treatment of depression. Another, resveratrol has impeccable 
credentials as a therapeutic, most recently for weight loss in the esteemed 
journal 'Cell Metabolism'. But not all herbal medicines are beneficial. In fact 
many are toxic and dangerous. Only proper high quality scientific testing 
including large well-designed randomized controlled trials can sort the wheat 
from the chaff. On this basis most claims by so-called 'complementary medicine' 
practitioners are quackery and stand condemned. Most homeopaths reject 
vaccination, for example. The NHMRC recognizes the popularity of 'alternative' 
interventions as therapies and is right to allocate funding for research to 
determine their veracity or otherwise. Thus educational institutions risk 
treading a dangerous path unless they rigorously evaluate each kind of 
'alternative' course before permitting its introduction. I would also add that 
they need to be very careful about appointing to academic positions, even 
adjunct (non-salaried ones) individuals who promote non-evidence-based 
'alternative' views. One chap in particular at RMIT comes to mind. RMIT really 
does need to take a close look at the academics on their books and jetison 
those who spout 'mystical' nonsense as if it were fact.</p> <br>

think that alternative medicine should have all its remedies

What is most likely to happen, is that these studies that have stood the test

science.<br>
If conventional medicine was right in its treatment of disease, 
there wouldn't be such a steady rise in chronic degenerative ill health amongst

(Antibiotics/PPInhibitors for gastritis due to H.Pylori comes to mind).</p> 
<p>And even if you do find small elements of these treatments that work, that 
does not justify accepting the plethora a garbage that comes in these course 
such as homeopathy, energy healing, acupuncture and kinesiology.<br>
Each 
treatment must be judged on its own merits per condition being treated, and it 
is intellectually dishonest to suggest this hasn't been done enough to purge 
universities of many of these modalities.</p> <br>

<p>There are natural nutrients which can lower homocysteine, help prevent

The dosages required are often not likely to be ingested from normal

<p>In my view, general practitioners should be prescribing magnesium for men, 
melatonin instead of sleeping pills, plus folic acid, coenzyme Q10 and vitamin 
D for everyone. To that should be added a potent antioxidant supplement - not a 
meagre multi-vitamin which has next to nothing in the way of selenium and 
vitamins C and E for example.</p> <br>

<p>If the double blind, placebo controlled study is an inappropriate tool for 
measuring acupuncture efficacy and providing an evidence base, then what is a 
suitable methodology?<br>
Please also explain any justification for calling 
evidence &quot;tainted&quot;.<br>
One trial (http://bit.ly/74AZmj) showed that 
the benefits of acupuncture may well be no more than placebo. The benefits may 
well be due only to the interaction of the therapist with the patient and not 
the therapy itself.<br>
Case study evidence is retrievable evidence; can you do 
this for the &quot;billions?<br>
Calling your evidence &quot;monolithically 
irrefutable&quot; and hence citing others as &quot;intellectually 
dishonest&quot; does nothing to build up your arguement but rather is just 
shifting the topic of discussion. No therapy gets to name its own mode of 
providing evidence; that is life, it is science, it is why we progress because 
the independence of evidentiary modality from the treatment modality hopefully 
helps with the progress of treatments.</p> <br>

that Japanese-style acupuncture is as effective as Chinese-style acupuncture,

<p>And yet what have you presented if not sound bites of your own? I find 
Ernst's intent very clear in his interview with Nature: he is contrasting CAM 
practices which do not currently have his preferred brand of high-quality 
research supporting their use, citing Homeopathy as an example, to practices 
which have garnered support as a result of objective inquiry, and here he uses 
acupuncture as a representative intervention. It's really a pretty 
straight-forward comment when taken in context.</p> <br>

<p>Here we have Richard present a textbook example of the Logical Fallacy 
called 'Special Pleading', where a standard of proof is required for all 
medical interventions except acupuncture.<br>
Randomized controlled trials and 
Placebo-controlled studies are effectively used to evaluate the efficacy of 
interventions. No good reason has been given why this particular intervention, 
acupuncture, should be exempt from the same evaluation standards and 
methodologies used for all other interventions. Acupuncture is not a 'special 
case', it is just another intervention that claims to have health benefits, and 
as such, should be held to the same standards of evaluation as every other 
intervention.</p>

and you're manifestly WRONG.</p> 
<p>I have been saying all along that randomised controlled double blind 
placebo studies are ONLY applicable to pharmaceutical drug trials and nothing 
else. That means that surgery, physiotherapy, psychiatry, psychology, 
hypnotherapy, and many, many other disciplines, (including acupuncture 
incidentally), are simply not appropriately tested with that particular 
research methodology. And indeed when you look into the evidence, you find that 
all of those other practices also &quot;suffer&quot; from a similar &quot;lack 
of evidence&quot; that you claim acupuncture does.</p> 
<p>Now, when you say that no good reason has been given why acupuncture should 
be exempt from from this evaluation standard/methodology, you have got it back 
to front. Its not up to me to prove why acupuncture should be exempt (because 
you can't prove a negative), its up to YOU to prove why acupuncture SHOULD be 
tested according to the methodology, which to any clear and objective thinker 
it seems suitable *ONLY for pharmaceutical drug trials.</p> 
<p>There is so much valid evidence backing the efficacy of acupuncture, so 
that when you choose only to use evidence from the one, sole, particular 
methodology which is not appropriate for testing acupuncture with (randomised, 
controlled double blind testing), then it really starts to seem that you're not 
interested in evaluating acupuncture objectively, just waging a witch-hunt 
campaign to expunge those practitioners whose ideology you disagree with from 
the mainstream system.</p> <br>

<p>Hi Richard, what do you think about studying the placebo response in 
combination with evidence based practice? There are already a few interesting 
papers and lots of discussion surrounding the potential benefits of using 
placebo as a supplement to clinical practice to enhance the effects of the 
latter. Do you think this is worthy of the redirection of funds away from 
modalities which are known not to work to? This also raises lots of ethical 
issues, which have been discussed in detail, including whether it is considered 
lying to patients, so it does open a can of worms in this regard. Thoughts?</p>

<p>Yes, I do think that there is a lot that is yet unknown about the placebo 
response, and that further research into this phenomenon is warranted. Medical 
professionals however should not treat patients condescendingly, and presume 
that patients are all dumb and stupid and easily deceived. In my opinion, most 
people are rational and intelligent, and should be treated as such.</p> <br>

<p>You have yet to explain how and why the concept of placebo is not relevant 
to acupuncture. At this stage the only evidence is that it doesnt suit your 
purposes.<br>
You seem to think that the placebo controlled, double blind study 
is the contrivance of the pharmaceutical industry. Check the history of the 
Helsinki Accord and the Nuremburg Code. Indeed, the concept of using controlled 
studies (treated vs untreated and controlling for confounders) goes back to the 
1800s.<br>
It seems that you have an expectation for others to accept your 
statements of historical relevance without knowing some relevant history 
yourself.</p> <br>

<p>What I am saying is that the physiological affect of acupuncture does not 
derive from the needle, but from the force which inserts and manipulates the 
needle. If you had a machine to insert the needle, it would have an effect, but 
the effect would be different from if a human inserted the needle, because the 
force behind it was different. In fact, the needle itself is irrelevant, its 
just one particular technique among many, and it doesn't need to be used at all.
</p> 
<p>The critical aspect of the acupuncture treatment is the interaction between 
practitioner and client, and the skill with which the practitioner applies the 
techniques which is appropriate to both the particular unique client and with 
respect to the practitioner's particular unique abilities.</p> <br>

integration of placebo (including psychological techniques and active 
listening) can be used to alleviate symptoms by altering perception of illness. 
This means they can be therapeutically used for these purposes, but ethically, 
is it right to lie to someone about a sham procedure and charge premium prices 
for it?</p> 
<p>Reiterating previous points, some elements of CAM (specifically compounds 
from plants) have a clinically significant function. We expect this, these 
compounds being biological in origin by chance interact with biochemical 
components of our body. No magical thinking there. Even these need to be 
researched and supported by evidence before being accepted. But the unsupported 
woo and magical thinking of ancient superstition has no place being taught at a 
university outside the sphere of anthropology or other disciplines which 
specifically examine cultures and their beliefs as an academic ends in itself.

<p>Now look, there are other principles of science that can produce a 
physiological effect apart from biochemicals. Look at this review: it shows 
that there IS evidence that is suggestive of electro-conductivity properties in 
acupuncture points and meridians, exactly like is predicted in TCM theory:

</p> 
<p>I believe its more biased of somebody with no intimate knowledge of a 
subject area to dogmatically oppose it than it is for somebody with deep 
understanding of a subject area to passionately advocate for it. Surely its 
time for anyone with a genuine scientific curiosity for the truth to approach 
these matters with a more open-mind, instead of literally trying to shut it 
down completely and have it thrown out of all educational institutions.</p> <br>

anything and everything could be a therapeutic agent.</p> 
<p>Correlation is not causation, and humans having poor association skills, 
often attributing cure to inert therapies used during the normal repair 
process. This is one of the drivers of antimicrobial resistance (my research 
area). The placebo effect surrounding the use of pharmacologically active 
agents (the immediate feeling of wellness despite there being insufficient time 
for the antimicrobials to have had an effect) causes patients to demand 
antibiotics at GP visits. Further, many times when antibiotics were previously 
prescribed, the patient had a viral infection (the antibiotics can't treat it), 
but the immune system cleared the infection. The patient's being on antibiotics 
makes them view the antimicrobial chemotherapy as the cure and not the 
unnecessary intervention, again driving over use. So even with known active 
therapies the placebo effect is highly relevant to the feeling of improved 
wellness before therapy has had sufficient time to work, or when the 
intervention is of no value to improving the disease outcome.</p> 
<p>It is evident that you are deeply emotionally invested in this belief 
system. Several psychological mechanisms and cognitive biases are acting as a 
lens for your selective data interpretation. No discourse rational or 
otherwise, amount of evidence nor clinical trial or study will shake your 
convictions. I think we have exhausted any possibility of further discussion as 
no doubt the same mantra will be repeated &quot;placebo does not apply to 
acupuncture&quot;, &quot;acupuncture cannot be tested by science&quot; or 
&quot;placebo controlled trial is specifically designed for drugs&quot;. None 
of these claims hold water, are special pleading, and the last point is dubious 
as even surgical intervention requires controlled trial showing that yes indeed 
a physical intervention can be tested by the method in question.</p>

<p>I see today's medicine as a type of clayton's medicine, ie the medicine 
you're having when you're not having medicine. But it is lucrative and helps 
support a health system where costs have blown out of control and people have 
increasing levels of chronic degenerative disease. Oh but of course that's due 
to living longer isn't it? [Irony intended]<br>
So what modern allopathic 
medicine tries to say is that degenerative disease is just a natural part of 
growing old, we should be content to live with just the symptoms being treated 
rather than finding a real cure.<br>

pharmaceutical products also. Why? Because any trial conducted by someone with 
a vested interest should be regarded as suspect. We collectively value 
independent research with sound methodology. That doesn't mean all 
practitioners wait for good trial data. Some early adopters jump at what a 
sales rep presents them. One study of ethics breaches by pharma companies 
highlighted the targeting of early adopters to prescribe patients to dubious 
medications. The medications subsequently had therapeutic licenses withdrawn, 
as a result of further studies. What does this tell me? That no matter what the 
product, adherence to the evidence and quality science, not claims and sales 
pitches achieves the best results. Also, that regulation based on hard evidence 
of safety and efficacy is paramount.</p> <br>

think the methodology is valuable, but it cannot be the end-all be-all of every 
healthcare decision we make. I think most of us, be we in clinical practice or 
in research, recognize this readily and will say that evidence for safety and 
efficacy are must-haves, but just as readily we see that no single methodology 
can lay claim to the whole of acceptable evidence.</p> <br>

<p>That whole long spigot of snide commentary you just spewed forth really 
highlights how little you actually know about this subject. Honestly, your 
ignorance permeates every paragraph, so much so that its actually tiresome for 
me to respond to it.</p> 
<p>But I will address two points: firstly, when you say &quot;the body has 
mechanisms of repair and healing as part of its innate biology&quot;, you ought 
to know that it is precisely this mechanism which acupuncture therapy 
encourages. The needles don't do any healing, as anyone with a sliver of 
understanding can grasp, they just trigger the patient's body's own healing 
response, and allows nature to take its course. So for you to say its 
&quot;placebo effect&quot; for the body to heal itself is not know what you're 
talking about: of course the body heals itself, that's what the acupuncture is 
there to encourage.</p> 
<p>Secondly, when you say &quot;correlation is not causation&quot;, you do so 
blissfully oblivious to the fact that, in TCM, this distinction is irrelevant. 
There is no correlation and causation in TCM, just a web of interconnectedness 
that allows us to escape the shackles of linear thinking and be broad-minded 
and lateral about our approach to patient care.</p> 
<p>Its evident you just don't care about patient's health, or about 
investigating new and exciting, interesting insights and modes of 
understanding. You're just so invested in your own precious order of linear 
thought that for any other free-thinking person to come along and exercise 
lateral and creative thought processing irritates you in the extreme. Its clear 
that further discussion here will be unfruitful (for you, I'm actually quite 
enjoying it), so you may as well slink off and mutter resentfully to yourself 
or something.</p>

future directions for research based on in-depth interpretation of the data. 
Bioelectromagnetics 29:245&ndash;256, 2008. &copy; 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.&quot;
</p> 
<p>If you read the abstract alone, it's highlighted that due to the low 
quality of the studies, neither demonstrates any significant effect, in fact it 
is likely that poor control of variables or other associations (confounders) 
were the reason.</p> 
<p>The final paragraph of the conclusion states as follows:</p> 
<p>&quot;Until better quality studies are performed, we are unable to 
determine whether acupuncture structures possess distinct electrical 
characteristics. Nevertheless, the preliminary evidence is encouraging and may 
contain clues to the physiologic nature of the elusive acupuncture point and 
meridian.&quot;</p> 
<p>So, it seems you have deficits in your comprehension skills also.</p> 
<p>If acupuncture engages the bodies own healing systems, why is there 
generally no significant results between placebo and acupuncture? And why is 
the only significant variation in patient reported belief of wellness over no 
intervention?</p> 
<p>Perhaps there is no biological mechanism of treatment other than altering 
stress levels and cortisol levels in turn, i.e. person feels treated becomes 
calmer, feels better, but is not in any way treated.</p> 
<p>My thought pattern is not linear, your comment smacks of irony. Many boxes 
need to be ticked to demonstrate effect, you simply attribute change in

Chinese-style acupuncture is generally not significantly different from 
Japanese-style acupuncture. Well that's good, lucky there's a choice I suppose.

That (single) study which you garnered this erroneous belief from DIDN'T EVEN

<p>So perhaps you can speculate about stress and cortisol all you like, but 
the evidence shows that acupuncture is clinically effective, so lets start to

<p>Apart from some evidence in chronic pain and stress relief, limited 
evidence of benefit. Pretty strong indicator of placebo. In fact research into 
stress reduction by being listened to is becoming well known and is a key 
reason many therapies are perceived to work. Not saying placebo is a bad thing, 
it has many clinical uses, but the evidence suggests there is no other effect. 
Ergo, my opinion is there is no further effect.</p> 
<p>I find it strange how one moment you say it can't be tested, then the next 
you're saying you need further tests, why should I believe in anything before I 
see results of further tests? Sounds like you're changing mantras fairly

<p>Pursuant to this discussion, Jarred, I would draw your attention to the 
latest review here:
http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/pdq/cam/acupuncture/healthprofessional/Page5
</p> 
<p>&quot;Four randomized controlled trials,[1,2,4,5] a nonrandomized clinical 
study,[3] and two case series [6,7] found that acupuncture enhanced or 
regulated immune function.</p> 
<p>The first randomized controlled trial found that acupuncture treatment 
enhanced platelet count and prevented leukocyte decrease after radiation 
therapy or chemotherapy, in comparison with the control group.[1]</p> 
<p>A second study involved a group of 40 postoperative cancer patients, 20 of 
whom received daily acupuncture treatment and 20 of whom served as a control 
group. After 3 days, leukocyte phagocytosis was enhanced in the treated group, 
compared with the baseline measurement (P &lt; .01); no such enhancement was 
observed in the control group.[2]</p> 
<p>A third study observed the effect of acupuncture on interleukin-2 (IL-2) 
and natural killer (NK) cell activity in the peripheral blood of patients with 
malignant tumors. The patients were divided into an acupuncture treatment group 
(n = 25), which received 30 minutes of acupuncture daily for 10 days, and a 
nonacupuncture control group (n = 20). The data showed that IL-2 level and NK 
cell activity were significantly increased in the acupuncture group, compared 
with the control group (P &lt; .01).[4]</p> 
<p>A fourth study observed the effect of acupuncture on T-lymphocyte subsets 
(CD3+, CD4+, and CD8+), soluble IL-2 receptor (SIL-2R), and beta-endorphin 
(beta-EP) in the peripheral blood of patients with malignant tumors. The data 
showed that acupuncture treatment increased the proportion of the CD3+ and CD4+ 
T-lymphocyte subsets, the CD4+/CD8+ ratio (P &lt; .01), and the level of 
beta-EP. It decreased the level of SIL-2R (P &lt; .01). The investigators 
suggested that the anticancer effect of acupuncture may be mediated via the 
mechanism of immunomodulation. [5]</p> 
<p>The nonrandomized clinical study showed that microwave acupuncture (MAT), a 
newly developed technique in which a specially designed device attached to a 
normally inserted acupuncture needle is used to deliver microwave radiation to 
a given point, enhanced the immunologic function of cancer patients. Although 
there was an increase in white blood cell count in the MAT group, the change 
was not significantly different from that seen in the control group under drug 
treatment.[3]</p> 
<p>In a clinical case series, 28 cancer patients who were treated with 
electroacupuncture (EA) while undergoing chemotherapy experienced no declines 
in T cells (CD3+, CD4+, CD8+) or in NK cell activity, both of which are usually 
suppressed by chemotherapy.[7] Similar findings were reported in a study 
comparing EA to the control in patients receiving chemotherapy for breast, 
colorectal cancer, and non-Hodgkin lymphoma.[8]</p> 
<p>In another clinical case series, 48 patients with leukopenia 
&mdash;including two cancer patients&mdash;who were treated with manual 
acupuncture experienced improvements in leukocyte count, intracutaneous 
phytohemagglutinin (PHA), and immunoglobulin (IgG, IgA, and IgM) levels after 
14 daily acupuncture treatments, compared with their pretreatment 
levels.[6]&quot;</p> 
<p>This evidence shows that their is certainly a physiological effect from 
acupuncture greater than just the patient &quot;believing they're better, but 
not really being better&quot;...</p> <br>

<p>You'll find that the stress hormone cortisol is antagonistic to the immune 
promoting dehydroepiandosterone, and cortisol generally correlates with 
suppressed immune function. Stress relief in cancer patients would therefore be 
of benefit to immunity.</p>

<p>If that's what a placebo can achieve through that route, it's still 
impressive. And there is evidence to suggest the lowering of cortisol achieved 
through the interaction is key to the benefit. If that's the mechanism, it's 
still hugely positive and preferable to pharmaceutical intervention. But it 
still doesn't require explanation with unproven assumptions.</p> <br>

<p>Richard's magical thinking in his own words:</p> 
<p>&quot;What I am saying is that the physiological affect of acupuncture does 
not derive from the needle, but from the force which inserts and manipulates 
the needle. If you had a machine to insert the needle, it would have an effect, 
but the effect would be different from if a human inserted the needle, because 
the force behind it was different. In fact, the needle itself is irrelevant, 
its just one particular technique among many, and it doesn't need to be used at 
all.&quot;</p>

were different types of qi in ancient chinese language taoist thought. The two 
concepts of force and qi are analogous, just expressed in a different language, 
and there's nothing magical or mystical about it, its straight up science.</p> 
<p>Furthermore, this distinction also points to why the concept of placebo is 
not relevant to discussion about acupuncture. Placebo is thought to be any 
healing response that is induced by the patients mind, as opposed to the 
physical healing response effected by the drug in question (because the concept 
of placebo only has meaning in the context of a pharmaceutical drug trial). 
However, in Traditional Chinese Medicine, the prime principle of treatment is 
that &quot;the mind leads the qi&quot;.</p> 
<p>So therefore, TCM affirms that the physical healing effect of acupuncture 
DOES originate in the mind, but that doesn't mean its &quot;placebo&quot; 
(because placebo is a concept that cannot be meaningfully removed from its 
endogenous context and translated into other areas). What it means is that TCM 
is an holistic discipline, which instead of seeking to be divisive and 
reductionist, seeks to treat the individual as a whole and complete mind-body 
system.</p> <br>

<p>No you wrong, on every count. Traditional Chinese Medicine was an ancient 
science, and just because it used a language steeped in mysticism does not 
detract from its scientific validity.</p> 
<p>And you do not need to test a placebo intervention when the the therapy is 
a relational interaction between practitioner and client. What is derided and

<p>Traditional Chinese Medicine was most definitely a science, and it was 
ancient. Chinese Medical Scholars detailed accurate maps of human anatomy tens 
of centuries before Da Vinci and compiled comprehensive Materia Medica 1000 
years before European physicians did. The Huang Di Nei Jing specifically 
rejected the influence of spirits and the use of magic, and outlined a mature 
synthesis of cosmological doctrines such as Yin and Yang and the Five Phases. 
It is these latter ideas that can be interpreted as being &quot;mystical&quot;, 
however, as cosmological systems they do have validity.</p> 
<p>There is an overwhelming abundance of evidence for the efficacy of 
acupuncture. As soon as when steps outside the paradigm of using pharmaceutical 
drug trial methodology to evaluate acupuncture, all this nonsense about 
&quot;placebo effect&quot; melts away:

<p>You web link doesn't refer to a published study, and I couldn't find one 
using the key words from the press release. The few actual studies I found show 
no significant difference MRI between electro-acupuncture and sham acupuncture. 
Which is not surprising as neither do very much at all.</p> <br>

in the patient's mind... So? TCM theory itself predicts this when it says: 
&quot;the mind leads the qi, the qi leads the blood&quot;. TCM theory itself 
predicted your main criticism of acupuncture, yet objectively, in clinical 
reality, its not a valid criticism any way.</p> 
<p>They purpose of medicine is not to make new scientific discoveries and to 
persecute practitioners of unconventional techniques, it is to aid the patient 
in improving their health. Acupuncture demonstrably has such an effect in every 
single study, and to scoff at that and bang on and on about the &quot;placebo 
effect&quot; is to fundamentally misunderstand the very nature of acupuncture 
as an holistic mind-body therapy itself.</p> <br>

<p>For you to claim this, you have to show Sham acupuncture (non-penetrating 
needles, needles placed in non-meridians, tooth picks that don't penetrate the 
skin at all, non of which correspond to Japanese acupuncture) is active and 
equivalent to acupuncture. BUT, as the asthma paper which you misinterpreted 
shows, it is no differnt from placebo, and has no effect on objective measures 
of disease.</p> 
<p>Of course, sham acupuncture is equivalent to real acupuncture in that

compromised, yet the other remains healthy because they have a healthy immune 
system. Can we say that is was the bacteria alone that caused the disease? Or 
do we have to take into account other factors?</p>

<p>These reviews state that there is a poor description of the interventions. 
Seeing as acupuncture is a skill, this needs to be taken into account. Alas, in 
these reviews, it is not, and therefore these reviews are not useful. In fact, 
only studies undertaken in China are likely to be useful, because Chinese 
practitioners are the most likely to be highly skillful in acupuncture.</p> <br>

the skin),&quot;<br>
And further down the page: &quot;for those who are 
apprehensive of inserted needles, a whole treatment can be done with 
non-insertive techniques.&quot;<br>
http://www.drflagler.com/id7.html</p> 
<p>See, this is a genuine Japanese style of acupuncture. </p> 
<p>Now, seeing as you've been proven to be so wrong about this Ian, do you 
agree that it proves that you are thus proven wrong about everything else you 
say and write?</p> 
<p>No, of course not. Likewise, one single study which incorporated some form 
of sham acupuncture technique as just one of the variables, and didn't even 
have anything to do with real acupuncture at all, doesn't prove a single thing 
about about acupuncture, not the slightest thing at all. It seems simply want

according to you.</p>

<p>No, I didn't say that. In fact Ian, as someone with experiential and 
intuitive understanding of this field, I know that the practice of acupuncture 
is as much an art as it is a science, and that the skill of the practitioner is 
of decisive consideration in determining how successful the therapy is. Its not 
like just a drug, which any Dr. can prescribe, as long as the diagnosis is 
correct. The procedure of acupuncture itself is actually a skill, like surgery, 
upon which the efficacy of the therapy hangs.</p> 
<p>So this is the critical variable you are missing, Ian. Sure, some 
acupuncturists of low skill may only elicit a placebo effect. Some 
acupuncturists may be skilled in Japanese acupuncture, some maybe be skilled in 
Chinese acupuncture, the &quot;placebo&quot; acupuncture may resemble Japanese 
acupuncture, it may not, there are so many variables unaccounted for and 
undocumented that most of the research in this field coming from outside China 
is of very dubious quality and doubtful implication.</p> <br>

<p>Actually Richard, I've just written a review on acupuncture with Edzard 
Ernst (in press) and we found Chinese studies were most likely biased towards 
being positive. When you looked at the same studies done in other parts of the 
world the Chinese ones were positive versus negative anywhere else. So it seems 
the Chinese are biased. Our recommendation was to be very careful when reading 
Chinese studies for this reason.</p> <br>

<p>Now I know from observation and experience that, in general (generalisation 
alert), practitioners in China are more likely to possess a very high degree of 
skill than Western practitioners (and even moreso, Western doctors with no 
lengthy period of highly specific study and clinical experience behind them).
</p> 
<p>My recommendation is to be highly sceptical of the results of ANY Western 
study, because they just don't take into account this critical variable. And 
this is also the real reason why there are more positive studies from China 
than any where else: because the skill of acupuncture practitioners is 
generally higher in China than any where else.</p> <br>

of the material world. One achievement of physics in the twentieth century has 
been to prove that that aim is unattainable.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>&ldquo;The world is not a fixed, solid array of objects, out there, for it 
cannot be fully separated from out perception of it.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>&ldquo;There is no absolute knowledge. And those who claim it, whether they 
are scientists or dogmatists open the door to tragedy. All information is 
imperfect. We have to treat it with humility. That is the human 
condition.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Richard, your confirmation bias precludes you from keeping an open mind in 
this discussion, therefore as I said in a comment somewhere else, there is no

<p>Do you realise that chronic degenerative diseases are on the rise with no 
cures in sight? What has modern conventional science-based medicine done to 
cure them and what is so marvellous about it that every other modality should 
follow suit?<br>
On the rise are diseases such as asthma, diabetes, autism, 
allergies, ms, dementia etc. One possible cause is allopathic medicine's 
failure to understand the need for a pure bloodstream and more holistic 
therapies. Pharmaceutical drugs don't cure, they merely suppress symptoms.</p>

<p>Hi Ian, I love that acupuncture for asthma study. I wish I could upload the 
graphs that show the stark differences between the subjective improvement for 
four interventions (Albuterol, placebo inhaler, sham acupuncture and nothing) 
versus the measured change in FEV for the same. For all three treatment arms, 
the patients thought they improved by between 45 and 50%, but when their FEV 
was measured improvement with Albuterol was 20.1%, but only 7.5, 7.3 and 7.1 
for the rest respectively. So there was in fact no difference in FEV for 
placebo or sham acupuncture versus nothing, but patients thought there was! 
Very scary stuff especially when we're talking the difference between breathing 
and not.</p>

<p>That paper proves absolutely nothing, it wasn't even a trial about real

There were four groups in this trial and four groups only: albuterol, placebo, 
sham acupuncture and no treatment. Notice that dirty four letter word in front 
of &quot;acupuncture&quot;? &quot;Sham&quot;? This trial has no inferable 
relevance to real acupuncture at all!</p> 
<p>How disingenuous of you Ian Musgrave and Rachel Dunlup to insinuate that a

was a placebo study that used 2 placebos one of which was sham acupuncture, the

<p>You have completely misunderstood the paper (and the purpose of quting it, 
which was clear in my original comment).</p> 
<p>The issue is that people report subjective improvement on placebos, but 
this is illusory, it is not matched by objective improvement.</p> 
<p>Of course, if sham acupuncture and real acupuncture give equivalent 
results, and sham acupuncture is not associated with objective results . you 
may draw your own conclusions.</p> <br>

<p>Now you are being disingenuous. You either accept that the research 
conducted is valuable, in which case both neck pain AND nausea are shown to be 
treated effectively with acupuncture above and beyond the placebo effect, or 
else you DON'T accept the research is valuable (because of the reasons I have 
outlined) and thus are left with &quot;merely&quot; the mountains of clinical 
evidence to rely on.</p> 
<p>But you can't accept only the research that indicates acupuncture is no 
more effective than placebo, but then turn around and try to deny the research 
that shows acupuncture is more effective than placebo, without being totally

<p>Not at all. The vast majority of placebo controlled studies are NOT well 
designed, because they do not account for the critical variable of practitioner 
skill. Therefore their findings are questionable at least.</p> 
<p>But even so, despite this and many other errors and limitations of these 
studies, even still, acupuncture is demonstrably effective, at least in the 
case of nausea and neck pain. Even in rats acupuncture is recently found to be 
effective in both treating and preventing chronic stress:
http://nccam.nih.gov/research/results/spotlight/010112.htm</p> 
<p>You have to accept Ian that there is more to this than is currently known, 
and to just instantly dismiss it as ineffective and mere placebo is not 
scientifically justified and is not aiding the advance of knowledge in this area

<p>This morning I heard ABC Radio National's Fran Kelly interviewing Prof John 
Dwyer, head of the lobby group for traditional medicine, and Prof Kerryn 
Phelps, an advocate and pratitioner of 'integrative' medicine. If Prof Dwyer is 
unable to listen to questions put to him in an interview, as was evident, then 
he is probably unable to listen to his patients. Therein lies much of the 
problem with traditional medicine - patients must fit within a set of symptoms 
and increasingly, people are looking for alternatives where they are treated as 
individuals. By subjecting alternative medicines to rigorous research in the 
university environment, medicine is improving all the time. Prof Dwyer's 
apparent belief that 'scientific medicine' is the only option is madness. 
Thalidomide was 'scientific medicine' once. Traditional medical practitioners 
are too fast to embrace - and prescribe - their miracle drugs and too slow to 
listen.</p> <br>

alternative views. They are very unilateral in their approach to the problems 
confronting contemporary science or technoscience which is a body of knowledge 
which is closely linked to society and nature and vice-versa. It sees no 
dichotomy between science and technology and each is an extension and 
embodiment of the other.</p> <br>

<p>Thalidomide was used in pregnancy without the same rigour applied to modern 
medicine. There was a different outlook and a lack of clinical trial stringency 
that apply today. If penicillin were invented today, it may not have made it 
onto the market due to some side-effects.</p> 
<p>Many things changed, even since the 80s thanks to science in medicine. 
Partly it's forced us to change much of what we thought. The mentality of the 
time is an important factor, new drugs were hailed panaceas and commercialised 
without restrictions (penicillin was sold in ointments and throat lozenges when 
it was released), society was of the opinion we could eradicate all infectious 
diseases. It was still believed we would soon know all there is to know and so 
on.</p> 
<p>Much has changed, science is showing some placebos are effective and better 
in some circumstances. Scientific medicine works, evidence so far is most 
alternative therapies are not effective.</p> <br>

<p>Consider this: light is not proven to be only a particle, and light is not 
proven to be only a wave...</p> 
<p>So what did the scientific community do with this problem? They knew light 
existed. They couldn&rsquo;t disprove light as a concept...so they embraced 
both sides of the argument and moved on! Scientists actually agreed to disagree 
and agreed that this is the right answer-there is not just one answer... have a 
think about that while closing your eyes and imagining the world with no light 
for a second-<br>
Impossible! Because through your scientific, absolute high 
class education system, you have been taught that light exists and is 
present-you probably don't even care if it&rsquo;s a particle or a wave, nor 
probably know the difference right now...</p> 
<p>The point is that the scientific community was able to adapt. And it 
actually adopted the logic of both arguments, put them together and embraced 
the fact that light can act both as a particle and a wave...</p> 
<p>Could it be possible that now is yet another time where the scientific 
community might actually have to agree to disagree and agree that both are 
right?</p> 
<p>I challenge you further...if we were to abolish from universities any 
complimentary/alternative or for my illustrative point, esoteric, energetic, 
magical or &quot;Luke&rsquo;s force&quot; medicine, which light system are you 
going to eradicate from science? Particle or wave? Perhaps the wave, because it 
simply sounds more whack to you? You cannot simply abolish particle theory 
because particle theory doesn't fit into the constraints of wave theory's 
parameters.</p> 
<p>On another note, I challenge any contender, (if you've even bothered to 
actually learn, not just criticise) explain how Chinese medicine works? If you 
are in the Chinese medicine industry, please don't answer, as this is best left 
to those who are criticizing it...feel free to add homeopathy, osteopathy, 
chiropractics...whatever other things you believe need to be eradicated from 
University studies.<br>
Then, compare them to the ideology of conventional 
medicine.</p> 
<p>Let me start you off with what I know. Chinese Medicine considers every 
individual unique. Their headache could be from the nerve pain that you just 
prescribed that sponsored drug for, or it could simply be due to the fact that 
they had a stressful day or many other reasons. How can any particular medicine 
that claims to treat the individual for their symptoms simply prescribe a drug 
marketed for this particular condition? with traditional Chinese medicine, 
acupuncture points and herbal medicine (as well as all the other complimentary 
modalities) tailor make treatment strategies for you to address what's really 
going on, not just to mask it up....the same reason why we see the high rollers 
in pristine suits, tailored to suit themselves. Why not try to tailor the 
treatments they prescribe by taking another approach?</p> 
<p>I'll leave with one more food for thought....what did you eat today? Do you 
know what was in it? no, I&rsquo;m not talking about the additives and their 
known side effects etc that for some reason the medical community don't care 
about as much, (almost as little as the known side effects for their own 
prescribed drugs, but not as much as covering their themselves in case of a law 
suit) I'm talking about what it actually was...did it contain garlic? Chili? 
spring onion? ginger? salt? sugar? ....I&rsquo;m willing to bet it contained 
something that is considered to some degree a natural medicine. Ok, so we all 
know when we eat chili we sweat, and scientists have proven its poison 
attributes...so why did you eat it? Do you believe it makes the food taste 
better? How was your blood pressure after eating it? Did it rise? Oh god, it 
must mean that its one of those damn natural medicines that has the potential 
to kill. Quickly, tell everyone now they should no longer consider their 
favourite 'spices' (dare I say herbs?) in their cooking....or wait, better stop 
cooking all together, send your whole family to the university to be 
re-educated, learn how to cook with preciseness that is proven scientifically 
in the latest and greatest food science course that now proves with chemical 
constituents, precise measuring and laboratory grade food what is the one and 
only best recipe for .... That favourite recipe your grandmother cooked for you 
as a child was actually wrong!!! ...why? Because the taster in the lab at 
university for narrow-mindedness thinks that his system for proving the best 
apple pie is the only one that now matters in the world...quickly, shut down 
the schools, close the caf&eacute;, restaurant, and supermarket. Buy your meals 
from uni of nar-min labs today!!! Where they are literally engineered to the 
checklist.</p> 
<p>How can you call yourselves academics, PhD candidates and doctors, 
I&rsquo;m ashamed to be associated by title.</p> 
<p>Wake up to the reality of a university-it is where revolution takes place, 
it is where learning occurs, and breakthroughs happen, society grows stronger 
with new knowledge. Remember how criticised Da Vinci was for cutting up and 
butchering those bodies, Michelangelo too... I wonder which side of the line 
you as the reader would be on now, compared to back then...burn Da Vinci at the

test against dentists because anatomy had been reduced to only a few hours. 
This has thankfully changed and anatomy is now a major part of that course.</p> 
<p>At the same time problem based learning in medical programs have not been 
tested for their effectiveness compared with the more rebust medical programs 
of a few decades ago. I have grave doubts that the flow-sheet approach we see 
by GPs these days when they diagnose illness is as effective as the whole of 
body and lifestyle approach of alternative practitioners.</p> 
<p>This is a sad situation when cutting costs at universities overrides the 
quality of training for the next generation of doctors. This is a whole other 
debate.</p> 
<p>In addition there must be concerns about the power of pharma companies in 
mainstream medicine, where drugs are considered as the first response rather 
than adjusting lifestyle. Responding to changes in blood pressure is a perfect 
example of this approach. The holy grail of pharma companies are chronic 
diseases treated with patented drugs that can be evergreened long into the 
future. In may ways current medical practice encourages this.</p> 
<p>Natural remedies go against this need. If it occurs naturally, it can't be 
patented, which may be why successful therapies don't seem to enter into the 
mainstream medical lexicon. The power of simple exercise on depressive 
illnesses is the perfect example of this. It is proven to be as effective as 
any drug in clinical trials but is seldom recommended by specialists in this 
area who work through a cocktail of drugs.</p> 
<p>At the same time, I feel that alternative medicines do need to be properly 
monitored. There are some shocking snake oil options out there and rubbish 
straight out a fantasy novel that shouldn't ever see the light of day.</p> 
<p>However, the only way these can be removed is by performing proper trials. 
Universities should not turn their back on alternative medicines but should 
subject them to the same strictures as they would with contemporary therapies.
</p> 
<p>At the end of the day, this is all about what is best for our health. The 
signatories of the Friends of Science in Medicine need to have a good long look 
at themselves and decide whether they are supporting a robust health practice 
or one that serves vested interests at the expense of us all.</p> <br>

<p>You are incorrect to say that 'natural medicines' can't be patented. I have 
personally seen many patents for proprietary combinations of herbs and other 
preparations. The Complementary Healthcare Council, which is the peak industry 
body in Australia is against making the TGA listing process more transparent 
for just this reason. They argue that forcing proper labelling and listing 
procedures for complementary products will result in the loss of intellectual 
property by manufacturers. I believe that the reason there is so little proper 
research by the major supplement and complementary companies is that they have 
no commercial interest in proving their products don't work, and they are not 
currently oibliged to provide TGA with evidence that they do work. This is 
completely the opposite situation for the pharma companies you are so 
unimpressed by. they have a legal (and I would say ethical and moral) 
obligation to prove effectiveness and safety before they go to market with a 
product.</p> 
<p>So who do you think is behaving more ethically? The people who are 
profiting from an established market who do not hold any proof that their 
products can do what they claim, or those who are spending a lot of money and 
time to prove that their products can do what they claim BEFORE they start 
selling them?</p> <br>

<p>Yes, Dr Vagg, you're right. I just patented an amino acid that you can buy 
in the supermarket. A patent must have something unique but that does not need 
to be the compound or molecule. It can be a new application for the 
herb/drug/molecule as was the case for me. Just as Viagra was once used as a 
cardiology drug, and was then re-patented for use in impotence.</p> <br>

<p>Just to clarify a couple of points. I don't think that you'll find that the 
defenders of the orthodoxy here are anti-alternative therapy. Merely, all that 
is asked is that sufficient evidence is provided for efficacy of a particular 
treatment modality. Once sufficient evidence is provided it becomes a valid 
therapy. If you can show us that something works well then it will no longer be 
fringe and move into accepted practice.</p> 
<p>Second point, I note the comments about Prof dwyer and Prof Phelps on ABC 
AM today. Yes Prof Dwyer was startingly hostile, but all he asked was for the 
provision of evidence. Prof Phelps, it should be noted, has a vested interest 
in alternative medicine as she profits from it. I'm not asserting it is a 
factor in her argument but I think she should acknowledge any potential 
conflict of interest when presenting her claims.</p> <br>

<p>Regarding naturopathy and herbalism, traditional use of medicines is 
recognized as a way to learn about potential future medicines. In 2001, 
researchers identified 122 compounds used in mainstream medicine which were 
derived from &quot;ethnomedical&quot; plant sources; 80% of these compounds 
were used in the same or related manner as the traditional ethnomedical use.</p>

<p>Not unreasonable comments, Brett. Part of what occurs during that 
derivation is the work to determine:<br>
What are the active ingredients <br>

what do they interact with<br>
What are the side effects <br>
what are their 
half lives (this affects dosing, short half life means frequent and often 
inconvenient dosing, long half life may mean the compound is in the system too 
long and this may be negative if there is a harmful side effect)<br>
Work done 
on original active ingredients may include modifications to reduce drug 
interactions, provide a more favourable half life just as examples.<br>

Unfortunately some of the more extreme elements of the &quot;alternative 
medicine&quot; industry will deny that &quot;natural substances&quot; are 
chemicals (by what logic?) and so can have no problems (by what logic?) In 
doing this they actually do a disservice to their industry as such claims are 
not credible and so expose themselves to ridicule and unfortunately more robust 
practices may get caught up in the ridicule.</p> <br>

As I said, naturopathy has provided western medicine with, at 
the very least, over 120 compounds and counting. To call it junk pseudo science 
is obviously not true. And as you pointed out, it is based on chemicals found 
in &quot;natural substances&quot;. The benefits, through centuries of trial and 
error, were discovered, in many cases, centuries before anyone knew how to 
scientifically test them. And to test just one plant extract takes many years, 
much patience and mucho dinero, so there are still thousands that have not been 
tested.<br>
I have always thought of naturopathy as having a symbiotic 
relationship with modern medicine. The nuturopath who treated me in the above 
anecdote was also a chemist.</p> <br>

<p>Even if only 50% of scientific studies are flawed, what it means is that 
the scientific method isn't the be-all and end-all of what is true and correct. 
There are many ways a study can go wrong, including being set up the wrong way, 
and not taking enough factors into account. Mostly the people who benefit from 
scientific studies are the pharmaceutical business and they are keen to have 
all therapies go through this process in order to eliminate any competition.</p>

<p>Hi Carole, with all due respect are you a research scientist? Only it 
doesn't sound like it from what you say about studies. Most studies that are 
set up the wrong way, or do not taking enough factors into account will not 
make it past peer review and will therefore not get published. Further, studies 
that are not designed well will not get funded in the first place so they will 
never even be done. It's a long and complicated process to get results 
published with many checks and balances on the way and it takes years. My last 
paper took 3 years between start and appearing in the literature.</p> 
<p>I'm not sure what you mean by &quot;benefit from scientific studies&quot; 
but if you take a look at PubMed you'll not find it full of Big Pharma funding. 
A lot of funding comes from the government (meaning tax payers) or donations 
(via charities).</p> 
<p>The last part of your comment is verging into Big Pharma conspiracy 
territory so I'll leave that alone.</p> <br>

and how to fix them, particularly with respect to pay-per-view.</p> 
<p>Peer review is not perfect - indeed it's how Andrew Wakefield's article 
about MMR and autistic colitis got through and look at the damage it's done 
(and continues to do). But it's the best method we have at the moment. The same 
can be said for the scientific process. We are always looking for ways to 
improve it, because science is self correcting. This is where CAM and science 
part ways - as Didier Nave so eloquently put it in a comment near the top of 
the page</p> 
<p>&quot;Time to face the facts. The data is coming in and its not looking 
good. It&rsquo;s clearly showing that what we do is not much better than 
placebo. So the question is do we have the humility to accept the evidence and 
dump these theories. I doubt it&hellip;.Have i seen the industry contest or 
reject its own stupidities like live blood analysis or &ldquo;detoxing&rdquo; 
when it can&rsquo;t name one toxin that its methods supposedly detox? No, it 
embraces them instead.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Science does change it's mind when new evidence is presented - and 
importantly that does includes a new herb or a new &quot;natural&quot; compound 
- CAM does not. We are not trying to &quot;roughshod&quot; over CAM but weed 
out the modalities and therapies that we have tested over and over again and we 
know do not and cannot work.</p>

again, the reason why we find these studies is that science doesn't take a 
single study as gospel and actually tests the finding rigorously - CAM doesn't 
do these basic levels of quality control).</p> 
<p>All therapies which have effects also have side effects, as an example the 
side effect profile of St. Johns Worth is pretty much the same as 
pharmaceutical Fluoxitine (except when what the sell you doesn't actually have 
any St. Johns Worth in it, a perennial problem with herbal medicines).</p> 
<p>The herbal medicines comfery, kava, Mua Huang have all been withdrawn 
becuase of serious side effects.</p> <br>

<p>Kava is an interesting example to use. I'm not sure what you mean by 
&quot;withdrawn&quot;. It is legal to sell here, and is freely available in 
most countries, and banned in others. I guess the science isn't settled? I

<p>Kava is an interesting example to use. I'm not sure what you mean by

remember it first being banned in Germany, and the reason then was that it 
became trendy for a while, and there was not enough supply to fill the demand, 
and shady growers and possibly unknowing suppliers who bought kava from those 
growers, started manufacturing Kava using the leaves and peelings of the 
plant&hellip;the parts that were always thrown away, and now, with recent 
research; the parts that are poisonous. (The conspiracy theory is that more and 
more people were turning to kava instead of Prozac, and &quot;Kava causes liver 
damage&quot; stories started to appear in the press, but this is no place for 
conspiracy theories).<br>
Kava has of course been used for thousands of years 
with no apparent &quot;serious side effects&quot;.<br>
Can it cause nausea, 
dyspepsia, gastrointestinal ulceration/bleeding, raised liver enzymes, 
diarrhea, constipation, epistaxis, headache, dizziness, priapism, rash, salt 
and fluid retention, hypertension, increase in hearing loss, esophageal 
ulceration, heart failure, hyperkalemia, renal impairment, confusion, 
bronchospasm, increased risk of erectile dysfunction, myocardial infarction, 
bullous pemphigoid or pemphigoid-like blistering? Taking it with alcohol can 
increase the risk of stomach bleeding and overdosing can kill you. Many people 
have died from taking too much, but if you survive, effects can include include 
abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, drowsiness, dizziness, headache, tinnitus, 
and nystagmus. Rarely, more severe symptoms, such as gastrointestinal bleeding, 
seizures, metabolic acidosis, hyperkalaemia, hypotension, bradycardia, 
tachycardia, atrial fibrillation, coma, hepatic dysfunction, acute renal 
failure, cyanosis, respiratory depression, and cardiac arrest have been 
reported.<br>
That long list of side effects is actually not regarding kava, 
but Ibuprofen, a very popular over the counter, scientifically approved drug. A 
touch of double standards, perhaps?</p> <br>

<p>We do know something about why some Kava causes toxicity and other preps 
don't and I think this was discovered after the German incident. It turns out 
the method of extraction, whether aqueous or solvent will effect the type of 
kavalactones which dominate in the mix. Some are more toxic than others. I've 
done an in vitro study here but there's plenty of literature out there</p>

<p>Yes Ian, and and at the moment CODEX is doing its best to restrict access 
to nutrients due to their dangerous side effects when taken in doses higher 
than one might find in the average diet. One of the reasons I'm against 
evidence-based medicine is it is too easily rigged to favour vested interests, 
and vice versa. First their was huge influx of rockefeller money into medical 
schools around 1900, then standardisation of medical courses in favour of 
pharmaceutical science. Since back in 1800s there has been a drive to eliminate 
any / all competition to standard pharmaceutical medicine as it has the push of 
the pharmaceutical business behind it. Very often CAM medicine is fragmented 
knowledge base and nobody in particular with vested interest. The Friends of 
Medical Science should back down or risk being classified as Friends of 
Pharmaceutical Science.</p> <br>

<p>Ian, when a person says &quot;up to 90%&quot; it can be anywhere ranging 
from 1 to 90.<br>
So the article is not theoretically incorrect. It is up to 
evidence based science to show that its studies are correct - which they are 
not entirely.</p>

<p>But the results were NEVER anywhere near 90%, for any study. The article 
you quoted doesn't say that either, so your statement of up to 90% is 
completely wrong.</p> <br>

credibility of medical research. He and his team have shown, again and again, 
and in many different ways, that much of what biomedical researchers conclude 
in published studies&mdash;conclusions that doctors keep in mind when they 
prescribe antibiotics or blood-pressure medication, or when they advise us to 
consume more fiber or less meat, or when they recommend surgery for heart 
disease or back pain&mdash;is misleading, exaggerated, and often flat-out 
wrong. He charges that as much as 90 percent of the published medical 
information that doctors rely on is flawed. &quot;</p> <br>

<p>Don't rely on newspaper articles (which greatly exaggerate the issues), 
I've read the original papers, and it is much ess than 50% (and even then the 
&quot;flaw&quot; in most of these papers is that the reported effects are 
bigger than established with more extensive clinicla trials. Again this is why 
we TEST all discoveries thoroughly, because chance alone can mean the some 
medicines appear to work better than they do, which is a point that CAM 
practitioners miss with their own claims)</p> <br>
