<h3>Neotame Artificial Sweetener Approved by FDA</h3> 
<h2><i>But is it Safe</i>?</h2> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<h2>Monsanto's NutraSweet Division Gets FDA Approval For Artificial Sweetener 
Neotame&nbsp;</h2> 
<h5>STEPHANIE M. HORVATH / Wall Street Journal 8jul02</h5> 
<p>WASHINGTON -- The Food and Drug Administration approved a new sweetener 
that it says is as much as 13,000 times sweeter than sugar.</p> 
<p><b><i>mindfully.org note</i>:</b>&nbsp;<br>
 Is it safe to use because the 
FDA approved it?<br>
<br>
 NutraSweet Co. makes Neotame, as well as NutraSweet.
<br> <br>
 A more appropriate question is;&nbsp;<b><br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Why 
isn't the EPA regulating it as a pesticide?&quot;</b>&nbsp;<br>
<br>
 And yet 
another question;<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; <b>&quot;Why should we believe that 
anything the FDA approves is safe?&quot;</b><br>
<br>
<b>Complaints against 
aspartame</b>[NutraSweet]<b> constitute 75% of all additive related complaints 
relayed to the FDA department of consumer complaints.&nbsp;<br>

Blaylock, M.D., Neurosurgeon, Jackson, MS (1999)&nbsp;<br>
<br>
 The FDA 
approved Neotame in spite of serious health concerns voiced prior to 
approval.&nbsp;<i>See more below.&nbsp;</i></p> <br>
<br>

<p>The sweetener, neotame, is made by NutraSweet Co., which also produces 
aspartame, a widely used sugar substitute that is 200 times sweeter than sugar.
</p> 
<p>NutraSweet President and Chief Executive Nick E. Rosa said the company 
plans &quot;to push really hard, really fast&quot; in marketing neotame after 
the FDA formally publishes its approval Tuesday. The main market is soft 
drinks, dairy products including yogurt and frozen dairy desserts, and chewing 
gum. The Mount Prospect, Ill., company plans to sell it primarily to the 
soft-drink and food industries rather than directly to consumers as a tabletop 
sweetener.</p> 
<p>Because of neotame's strength -- it usually would take 8,000 teaspoons of 
sugar to equal the sweetening power of one teaspoon of neotame in most products 
-- Mr. Rosa said the &quot;economic benefit is extraordinary&quot; for makers 
of soft drinks and other products that use sugar substitutes.</p> 
<p>Mr. Rosa said soft-drink companies will be able to get the same taste by 
using less sweetener and more water, cutting down on production costs.</p> 
<p>But Mr. Rosa said he doesn't see neotame, a white crystalline powder, 
taking the place of aspartame in the sweetener market. &quot;We don't think 
there's going to be a 1-to-1 replacement,&quot; he said. The new sweetener, he 
said, can be blended with regular sweeteners such as corn syrup as well as with 
other sugar substitutes.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>The FDA has approved neotame for general use in foods, except for meat and 
poultry. Alan Rulis, director of the FDA's office of food-additive safety, said 
the FDA found that there were no &quot;risks or concerns&quot; associated with 
neotame, and that it met the safety standards applied to all food additives. 
NutraSweet must submit a special request for neotame to be considered for use 
on meat and poultry because those two foods fall under the jurisdiction of the 
Department of Agriculture. Dr. Rulis said NutraSweet didn't request such 
consideration.</p> 
<p>Neotame was rolled out in Australia and New Zealand six months ago, and is 
being used in soft drinks, yogurt and powdered gelatin mixes. Mr. Rosa said 
three to five more products that use neotame are expected to be introduced 
shortly.</p> 
<p>NutraSweet's aspartame, widely sold under the Equal brand, had come under 
fire a few years ago when it believed to be a possible cause of brain tumors. 
But after reviewing a large number of studies, the FDA concluded it was safe 
and that further study wasn't needed. Mr. Rosa said aspartame is 
&quot;absolutely safe&quot; and that allegations made against it have never 
been proved.</p> 
<p>WASHINGTON (AP 5jul02) -- Neotame, a nonnutritive sweetener said to be 
7,000 to 13,000 times sweeter than sugar, has been approved for marketing as an 
additive in candies, soft drinks and some other products, the Food and Drug 
Administration announced Friday.</p> 
<p>The FDA said that neotame is a white crystalline powder that dissolves in 
water and can be used as a mealtime sweetener or added to recipes.</p> 
<p>It has been approved for use in baked goods, nonalcoholic beverages, 
chewing gum, confections, frozen desserts, gelatins and puddings, jams, 
jellies, fruit, juices, toppings and syrups.</p> 
<p>Neotame was approved after the FDA reviewed more than 113 animal and human 
studies, some of which were designed to detect any cancer-causing, reproductive 
or neurological effects. The agency said it concluded from the studies that 
neotame was safe for human consumption.</p> 
<p>Neotame is manufactured by NutraSweet Co. of Mount Prospect, Ill.</p>

<p>The Food and Drug Administration today announced its approval of a new 
sweetener, neotame, for use as a general-purpose sweetener in a wide variety of 
food products, other than meat and poultry. Neotame is a non-nutritive, high 
intensity sweetener that is manufactured by the NutraSweet Company of Mount 
Prospect, Illinois.</p> 
<p>Depending on its food application, neotame is approximately 7,000 to 13,000 
times sweeter than sugar. It is a free-flowing, water soluble, white 
crystalline powder that is heat stable and can be used as a tabletop sweetener 
as well as in cooking applications. Examples of uses for which neotame has been 
approved include baked goods, non-alcoholic beverages (including soft drinks), 
chewing gum, confections and frostings, frozen desserts, gelatins and puddings, 
jams and jellies, processed fruits and fruit juices, toppings and syrups.</p> 
<p>In determining the safety of neotame, FDA reviewed data from more than 113 
animal and human studies. The safety studies were designed to identify possible 
toxic effects, such as cancer-causing, reproductive, and neurological effects. 
From its evaluation of the neotame database, the FDA was able to conclude that 
neotame is safe for human consumption.</p> 
<p>New food additives, including new sweeteners, must be approved by FDA as 
safe before they may be marketed in the United States.</p>

Re: Docket No. 99F-0187; FAP 9A4643; Neotame</p> 
<p>On August 16, 2000, on behalf of our client, the undersigned submitted 
comments to the above-referenced docket. Those comments identified a number of 
concerns that pertain to the adequacy of the safety data submitted in support 
of FDA&#146;s approval of neotame. In particular, the comments questioned the 
adequacy of the data in resolving issues regarding the body weight gain of test 
animals consuming neotame, and their reported food consumption values.</p> 
<p>Our client has monitored developments on this petition through periodic 
reviews of the docket and Freedom of Information Act requests. These reviews 
have not uncovered any material submitted by the petitioner that addresses the 
body-weight gain issue. Our client continues to believe that there is 
insufficient data concerning the toxic effect on growth to resolve this issue. 
The body weight gain issue impacts the establishment of a no effect or no 
adverse effect level and must, therefore, be evaluated closely. Our client 
believes these issues can be resolved only through the generation of additional 
data, as outlined in our earlier comments.</p> 
<p>Serious concerns raised by our client require definitive resolution to 
remove any remaining doubts about the safety of neotame prior to its 
introduction into the marketplace, and, equally important, to assure reasonable 
certainty that no harm will result from consumption of neotame. The Agency and 
public should have the opportunity to review the additional data needed to 
address these issues, along with appropriate explanations prior to the issuance 
of a final rule.</p> 
<p>Thank you for your attention to this matter.</p> 
<p>Very truly yours,<br>
 Richard H. Koby</p>

<p>Re: Neotame Identifying Information</p> 
<p>I am enclosing a scientific paper accepted for publication by the Western 
Journal of Medicine. As such there has to be a confidentiality until 
publication.</p> 
<p>I believe publication is scheduled for April 1999, although this timing is 
out of my control. The issues of possible cancer induction need to be fully 
addressed since the &#147;neotame&#148; metabolism appears to be similar to 
that of aspartame. Please include this data in your analysis.</p>

Rockville, MD 20852&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Dear Sirs,<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You have 
received my previous letters of March 3, 1998 and February 25, 1999, expressing 
myextreme professional opposition to the approval of Neotame as an all-purpose 
sweetener (copies of both are enclosed) without further data.<br>
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This correspondence is prompted by 
my analysis of Monsanto's &quot;Environmental Assessment,&quot; dated December 
17, 1998, which I have just read today. I am troubled by its shortcomings, 
based on my 15-year interest and researches on its analog, aspartame. In view 
of thedeadline of April 10, 1999, I am writing my criticisms as a supplement to 
my prior letters. They only can be summarized here.<br>
<br>
I.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Environmental Impact<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I believe that there is 
a potentially significant impact that cannot be necessarily shown by the rat 
and dog studies, or in the extremely short (<b>13 weeks</b>) tests on healthy 
subjects.<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Contrary to the Monsanto 
submission, I have considerable data that point toaspartame being toxic, 
mutagenic, carcinogenic, diabetogenic and teratogenic. These assertions stem in 
part from the experience of over 1,200 (<b>!</b>) aspartame reactions in my own 
database.<br>
<br>
II&nbsp;&nbsp; Animal Testing<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It isa gross error to project the animal studies 
onto humans where the massive consumption of this chemical is envisioned. 
(Currently, over half of the population consumes aspartame products.) For 
example, these species metabolize phenylalamine 4-5 times faster than humans. 
Moreover, phenylalamine concentrates much more on the fetal side of the 
placenta, and readily crosses the blood-brain barrier to affect the fetus brain.
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Comparable arguments could be made for 
aspartic acid and methanol, which I have addressed in many publications.<br>

<br> IV.&nbsp;&nbsp; Diabetics<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The assertion 
that aspartame/neotame does not affect glycemic control is<b><i>WRONG !</i></b> 
As a Board-certified internatl and endocrinologist, I have repeatedly found 
that aspartame products aggravate both diabetes control and its 
complications--and have written on this subject. My requests of 
corporate-sponsored researchers in this realm to justify their published 
&quot;negative&quot; conclusions have not been answered.<br>
<br>

V.&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Small Amounts&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It 
is erroneous to assume that &quot;a dietary concentration of less than 10ppb [
<i>parts per billion</i>] of each minor degradant. . .&quot; is innocuos. From 
my work on pesticides, there are several molecules in each cell even in parts 
pertrillion.<br>
<br>
CONCLUDING COMMENTS<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I 
am a totally corporate-neutral physician who is concerned about the ongoing 
exposure of the population to aspartame and numerous other chemicals that were 
approved without adequate long-term pertinent studies by corporate-neutral 
investigative and politically-neutral regulators.<br>
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me repeat:it will be a public health tragedy 
if the aspartame problem is allowed to be repeated in the absence of these 
safeguards<b>!</b></p>
