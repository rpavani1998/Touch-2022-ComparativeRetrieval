<p>&nbsp;</p> <b>Dr. Carol A. Vavra</b> <br>

<p>Dr. Carol Vavra's experience stems from working in many different types of 
clinics, ranging from emergency clinics, to full service clinics, to 
out-patient clinics.&nbsp;She began learning holistic veterinary care after 
becoming increasingly frustrated at seeing the same problems over and over 
again in our pets such as arthritis, back (disc) abnormalities, and 
others.&nbsp; Medications and surgery could only help to a certain 
degree.&nbsp; That was when she began learning about acupuncture and how it was 
used for pain relief.&nbsp; Shortly after that she began the Veterinary 
Acupuncture Certification program offered by the Chi Institute of Traditional 
Chinese Medicine in central Florida. The concept of treating the WHOLE animal, 
not just the particular ailment, is the most important aspect of the treatment 
and this is what acupuncture and Chinese herbal formulations do.&nbsp; This is 
such a basic concept but is forgotten in many practices and also lost in human 
medicine.</p> 
<p>Below Dr. Vavra gives us a better understanding of holistic care for our 
beloved companions.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p> <br>

<p>  QuickTime Video Plug-In BullmastiffInfo.org:&nbsp; Please explain what 
holistic medicine is.</p> 
<p><b>Dr. Vavra:</b>&nbsp; Holistic medicine to me means using ALL aspects of 
medicine to help prevent, diagnose, or treat disease.&nbsp; This must include 
conventional western medicine as well as alternative modalities such as 
supplements, herbals (both western and Chinese), homeopathy, etc.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>  BullmastiffInfo.org:&nbsp; In your practice you incorporate the knowledge 
of both Western and Eastern philosophies.&nbsp; How does help you help your 
clients?</p> 
<p><b>Dr. Vavra:</b>&nbsp; The more we can offer the client, the greater the 
chance we can help their pets.&nbsp; It is essential to establish the correct 
diagnosis and western medicine is always needed before the correct treatments 
can begin.&nbsp; It is so important for our pets to undergo all appropriate 
diagnostics including bloodwork, x-rays, ultrasound, biopsies, and other tests 
as determined by the veterinarian.&nbsp; We can then look at all the treatment 
options, and many times a combination of western and Chinese medicine is the 
best way to go.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
<p>  BullmastiffInfo.org:&nbsp; Please explain what practices are involved 
with holistic veterinary medicine.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
<p><b>Dr. Vavra:&nbsp; </b>I prefer to cal it Complementary Medicine because 
these modalities are used in conjunction with conventional medicine. They 
include acupuncture, homeopathy, chiropractic therapies, herbal therapy (both 
western and eastern), supplements, nutrition, orthomolecular therapy, magnetic 
therapy and others.</p> 
<p> BullmastiffInfo.org:&nbsp; What is acupuncture?&nbsp; Are there different 
methods of acupuncture?&nbsp;</p> 
<p><b>Dr. Vavra: </b> &nbsp;Acupuncture is the process of stimulating certain 
points along meridians in the body to create a physiologic response that helps 
treat and prevent disease.&nbsp; Many different techniques can be used when 
using Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) to diagnose and treat our pets.&nbsp; 
Variations include the number of points selected, length of the treatment time, 
method of point stimulation, and types of points used.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p> 
<p>  QuickTime Video Plug-In BullmastiffInfo.org:&nbsp; Please explain what 
&#147;meridians&#148; are.&nbsp; </p> 
<p><b>Dr. Vavra: </b> &nbsp;Meridians are energy channels in the body - most 
acupuncture points are located on meridians.&nbsp; These meridians 
&#147;connect&#148; the internal organs to the acupuncture points.</p> 
<p>  BullmastiffInfo.org:&nbsp; Do these &#147;meridians&#148; differ from 
species to species?</p> 
<p><b>Dr. Vavra:</b>&nbsp; Not dramatically when we are talking about 
mammals.&nbsp; Dogs, cats, and horses have the same meridians humans do.&nbsp; 
More studies are required on birds, but many points have been used with various 
degrees of success.</p> 
<p>  BullmastiffInfo.org:&nbsp; What about in different breeds within the same 
species?&nbsp;</p> 
<p><b>Dr. Vavra:</b>&nbsp; The meridians would be in the same anatomical 
positions in the different breeds.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>  BullmastiffInfo.org:&nbsp; How does herbal treatment work?&nbsp; </p> 
<p><b>Dr. Vavra:</b>&nbsp; Chinese herbals work using TCM principals, and not 
the western medicine diagnosis.&nbsp; I may see 3 different animals with hip 
dysplasia, and each would require a different Chinese herbal formulation based 
on the TCM diagnosis.&nbsp; These TCM principals include Yin/Yang imbalances, 
hot or cold conditions, wind or damp conditions, and many others, most of which 
do not have a western medicine definition.&nbsp; This is why we ask MANY 
questions about the pet&#146;s habits, preferences, and daily behavior, and 
want to know about the environment they live in.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>  BullmastiffInfo.org:&nbsp; Are these herbs easily accessible over the 
counter?&nbsp; Or should the herbals that are used be specifically made for 
animals?</p> 
<p><b>Dr. Vavra:</b>&nbsp; There are many sources of Chinese herbals out 
there.&nbsp; Reputable companies should only sell herbals to professionals who 
have a knowledge of herbals and how to prescribe them.&nbsp; Along those same 
lines, anyone who buys herbals (veterinarians, other professionals) wants to be 
confident that there is quality control within the company and we are getting 
what we order.</p> 
<p>The majority of herbals are formulated for humans &#150; I know of only one 
company that formulates herbals specifically for dogs, cats, and horses.&nbsp; 
Both work equally well and are prescribed in the same manner.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
<p>  BullmastiffInfo.org:&nbsp; What conditions are most receptive to 
acupuncture and herbal treatment?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
<p><b>Dr. Vavra:</b>&nbsp; Painful conditions such as arthritis and back 
problems usually respond well.&nbsp; I also find geriatric animals respond well 
to basic geriatric support.&nbsp; They get more energy and owners find they 
participate in daily activities more.&nbsp; Animals who have paralysis or 
weakness in the limbs can also be helped.&nbsp; Many more conditions can be 
treated, conditions which wouldn&#146;t immediately come to mind.&nbsp; Animals 
with chronic conditions such as kidney and liver disease and animals with 
cancer can also benefit from acupuncture and herbals.&nbsp; I encourage anyone 
with a pet who is battling a problem to find a veterinarian who is familiar 
with alternative therapies and ask what more can be done.&nbsp; They will be 
surprised.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
<p>  BullmastiffInfo.org:&nbsp; How soon would a client see results as a 
result of holistic care?</p> 
<p><b>Dr. Vavra:</b>&nbsp; Most of these therapies work to bring the body back 
into balance so results can take time. In many animals we see an initial 
response to the first 1-2 acupuncture treatments, and they will continue to 
improve with more treatments.&nbsp; Some may take 7-8 treatments to see a 
response.&nbsp; A few animals will not respond at all.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>  BullmastiffInfo.org:&nbsp; Would the client have to continue the same 
treatment for the duration of their life to continue good health or would they 
be &#147;cured&#148; of the actual ailment after a set number of 
treatments?&nbsp; Under what circumstances?</p> 
<p><b>Dr. Vavra:</b>&nbsp; This depends.&nbsp; Animals with chronic  
conditions (arthritis, cancer, disc problems, kidney disease, etc) will need 
ongoing treatment, but the goal is to eventually space these out so we may only 
see them every few weeks to months.&nbsp; Animals with acute conditions 
(bacterial infections, diarrhea, soft tissue injuries) may only need a few 
treatments.&nbsp; And, of course, each animal responds differently.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p> 
<p>....continue....</p> 
<p> BullmastiffInfo.org:&nbsp; Acupuncture and herbal care is also conducted 
on humans, would you be able to perform acupuncture and herbal care on humans 
as well?&nbsp; Why or why not?</p> 
<p><b>Dr. Vavra:</b>&nbsp; This is not only unwise, but illegal.&nbsp; And 
this holds true for human acupuncturists treating animals.&nbsp; We as 
veterinarians are not trained in human medicine and, even though much of the 
physiology and disease processes are the same, should not attempt to practice 
medicine on a human.&nbsp;&nbsp; In the past many human acupuncturists would do 
acupuncture on animals, mainly because veterinary acupuncturists did not 
exist.&nbsp; This should never be encouraged for many reasons, the main one 
being that the proper diagnosis was usually never made.&nbsp; Now that there 
are many veterinary acupuncturists out there, this should not be a problem.</p> 
<p><b> BullmastiffInfo.org:&nbsp; Many families are still hesitant to try 
holistic care for their beloved companion.&nbsp; What advice can you give to 
these families to become more comfortable with the merge between holistic and 
conventional veterinary care?</b></p> 
<p><b>Dr. Vavra:</b>&nbsp; The first and most important point is that it MUST 
be a merge of all modalities.&nbsp; A client should never be told that 
&#147;this way&#148; is the only way to treat their animal, whether it be 
conventional medicine, or acupuncture, or chiropractic care, or 
homeopathy&#133;&nbsp; If any practitioner says this they should go for a 
second opinion, or third opinion.&nbsp; Secondly, I think many people are put 
off by the term &#147;holistic&#148;.&nbsp; They believe if they see a holistic 
veterinarian they will be told that all conventional medicine is bad and they 
should stop all medications, vaccines, and other therapies.&nbsp; This is not 
true.&nbsp; The best practitioner will use a combination of therapies to help 
the pet, and the veterinarians should work together to formulate the best 
treatment.&nbsp; And last, they should ask themselves if they are happy with 
the results of the specific treatment their pet is receiving.&nbsp; What about 
side effects?&nbsp; Are the painkillers still working?&nbsp; Has the cancer 
returned?&nbsp; If the current treatment, whatever it is, is no longer working 
for their pet, they should ask their veterinarian to help them find someone who 
can answer their questions about alternative therapies.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
<p><b> BullmastiffInfo.org:&nbsp;&nbsp; Are there any books and/or articles 
that you recommend for pet owners that would like to become more acquainted 
with holistic practices for their pets?</b></p> 
<p><b> Dr. Vavra:</b>&nbsp; My favorite book for clients about Chinese 
Medicine is&nbsp;Four Paws Five Directions :by Cheryl Schwartz DVM.&nbsp; This 
discusses Traditional Chinese Medicine theory and how it is applied using 
acupressure, herbals, and food.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
<p> I also like Natural Healing for Dogs and Cats A-Z, also by Cheryl Schwartz 
DVM.&nbsp; Two other books that discuss acupressure are Acu-Cat, A Guide to 
Feline Acupressure, and The Well Connected Dog, A Guide To Canine Acupressure, 
both by Amy Snow and Nancy Zidonis.&nbsp; There are many books out there about 
treating animals in a more natural way and it is important that clients discuss 
any treatments with their veterinarian or a veterinarian who is interested in 
holistic therapies.</p> 
<p><b> BullmastiffInfo.org:&nbsp; Credentials are always important when 
looking for a qualified holistic practitioner, what should a client look for 
when searching for a holistic veterinarian for their companion?</b><b> </b></p> 
<p><b>Dr. Vavra:</b>&nbsp; Many modalities now have certification 
courses.&nbsp; Veterinarians who practice acupuncture, chiropractic care, and 
homeopathy can and should be certified.&nbsp;</p> 
<p><b> BullmastiffInfo.org:&nbsp; Holistic medicine is slowly becoming more 
acceptable by veterinarian clinics that primarily practice Western medicine and 
techniques.&nbsp; For those clinics that have not yet opened their doors to 
holistic care, what advice do you have for them to become more comfortable with 
this Eastern concept?</b><b> </b></p> 
<p><b>Dr. Vavra:</b>&nbsp; Many veterinarians will refer their patients for 
alternative therapies as a last resort, when no other treatments are 
working.&nbsp; Some will never refer for alternative therapies.&nbsp; I believe 
in both these cases the veterinarians are not aware of exactly what conditions 
can be treated with alternative therapies, or they feel if western medicine is 
not helping, nothing can.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Education is the key here.&nbsp; Becoming more familiar with alternative 
therapies will help all veterinarians talk about these with their clients and 
offer more treatment options early in the course of a disease.&nbsp; Also, more 
and more clients are seeking treatments other than medications, chemotherapy, 
or surgeries, or want to minimize these if they can.&nbsp; They should trust 
their veterinarian to give them the most recent information or be able to refer 
them to someone who can.</p> 
<p><b> BullmastiffInfo.org:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What is the best way to contact 
you for an appointment and/or consultation?</b></p> 
<p><b>Dr. Vavra:</b>&nbsp; I can be contacted at  cvavradvm@yahoo.com.&nbsp; I 
will only be able to answer general questions about Traditional Chinese 
Medicine and other alternative therapies without actually seeing an 
animal.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> Closing Thoughts:&nbsp; </p> 
<p><b>Dr. Vavra:&nbsp; </b>Traditional Chinese Medicine and other 
complementary therapies are gaining acceptance and popularity in the United 
States, but have been practiced in other areas of the world for hundreds and 
even thousands of years.&nbsp; I truly believe that it is our responsibility as 
pet owners and veterinarians to research and offer the best possible care for 
our loved ones, whether two- or four-legged.&nbsp;</p>
