<p>&ldquo;Here's a good one! If you have been wondering how acupuncture works, 
I think you will then enjoy this read. I wrote this paper for my doctoral 
candidacy, and it was well received by many students at Emperor's College who 
were looking for a good essay to give patients that were curious from a western 
perspective on how acupuncture works. Let me know what you think.<br>

<p>Opening the Door to Effective Pain Management for Millions of Americans: 
<br></p> 
<p>Acupuncture from a Neuro-Physiological Perspective<br>
</p> 
<p><br>
</p> 
<p>by Brendan Armm, DAOM, LAc<br>
</p> 
<p><br>
</p> 
<p>&Acirc;&nbsp;&Acirc;&nbsp;&Acirc;&nbsp;&Acirc;&nbsp; One in four U.S. 
adults has complained of suffering a day-long bout of pain in the past month, 
and one in ten declared the pain had lasted over a year, according to the U.S. 
government&rsquo;s annual, comprehensive report on Americans&rsquo; health: 
Health, United States, 2006, released by the National Center for Health 
Statistics of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).1 Viewing 
acupuncture from a neuro-physiological standpoint allows Western scientists to 
determine how this holistic medicine works so well.<br>
</p> 
<p>&Acirc;&nbsp;&Acirc;&nbsp;&Acirc;&nbsp;&Acirc;&nbsp; Various theories have 
been posited on the etiology of pain in both Western and Eastern medicine.<br>

</p> 
<p>&Acirc;&nbsp;&Acirc;&nbsp;&Acirc;&nbsp;&Acirc;&nbsp; According to pain-gate 
control theory, the swift speed of A-fibers from insertion of cutaneous needles 
impacts the brain analgesically serving to block muscular pain originating from 
the slower C-fibers. Thus, the sensation of cutaneous acupuncture blocks 
muscular pain.<br>
</p> 
<p>&Acirc;&nbsp;&Acirc;&nbsp;&Acirc;&nbsp;&Acirc;&nbsp; Puncturing the skin 
introduces foreign bodies subcutaneously. The stimulus causes an immune 
response in various locations which accounts for the lymphatic system&rsquo;s 
role in pain management.<br>
</p> 
<p>&Acirc;&nbsp;&Acirc;&nbsp;&Acirc;&nbsp;&Acirc;&nbsp; Hilton&rsquo;s Law 
states that stimulating skin nerves at joints causes affects deeper in the 
joint itself. This theory applies to acupuncture points. Placing needles at or 
around pain points serves to transmit nerve impulses deep beneath the skin 
giving a therapeutic effect, including alleviating pain and disease.<br>
</p> 
<p>&Acirc;&nbsp;&Acirc;&nbsp;&Acirc;&nbsp;&Acirc;&nbsp; According to Chinese 
medical theory, acupuncture points were discovered by comparing given pathology 
to referred &ldquo;ashi&rdquo; or sore points. Treating referred points (local 
and distal) served to alleviate disease.<br>
</p> 
<p>&Acirc;&nbsp;&Acirc;&nbsp;&Acirc;&nbsp;&Acirc;&nbsp; The well-known opioid 
theory for pain has been thoroughly explored in acupuncture by Miltiades 
Karavis, MD in Athens, Greece. Dr. Karavis specializes in treating pain using 
conventional biomedical treatment in conjunction with acupuncture. He notes, 
&ldquo;We can explain the action of acupuncture in acute and chronic pain 
syndromes, in addiction, and in psychiatric disease through the role of central 
neurotransmitters and the modulatory systems that are activated by 
acupoints:&Acirc;&nbsp; opioid, non-opioid and central sympathetic inhibitory 
mechanisms.&rdquo;2&Acirc;&nbsp; <br>
</p> 
<p>&Acirc;&nbsp;&Acirc;&nbsp;&Acirc;&nbsp;&Acirc;&nbsp; Dr. Karavis states in 
The Neurophysiology of Acupuncture: a Viewpoint, &ldquo;Acupuncture is a 
specialized sensory stimulation that is analyzed through sensory neural 
pathways. Therefore to understand its action we have to analyze the anatomy, 
physiology and pharmacology of the nervous system, aided with knowledge of 
neuroendocrinology and the chemoarchitecture of the brain.&rdquo;2<br>
</p> 
<p>&Acirc;&nbsp;&Acirc;&nbsp;&Acirc;&nbsp;&Acirc;&nbsp; According to Deke 
Kendall, OMD, PhD, LAc, in his book, Dao of Chinese Medicine, needling a 
therapeutic location creates a beneficial change via the nervous and 
vasculature systems with consistent and effective results. Dr. Kendall further 
notes, &ldquo;The practitioner is in complete control of the treatment for 
desired effect.&rdquo;3&Acirc;&nbsp; He states that acupuncture is 
evidence-based medicine. These specific nodes (acupuncture points) are slightly 
warmer than non-nodal sites, are slightly depressed into the skin, and have a 
lower electrical conductivity. He refers to these points as neurovascular nodes 
because of the dependency on the nervous system and vasculature.<br>
</p> 
<p>&Acirc;&nbsp;&Acirc;&nbsp;&Acirc;&nbsp;&Acirc;&nbsp; Research has provided 
evidence for acupuncture&rsquo;s efficacy in pain relief in relation to the 
Central Nervous System (periaqueductal gray, thalamus, and pituitary gland) and 
the Cardiovascular System (nitrous oxide, vessel control, and blood pressure). 
Terry Oleson, PhD, researching acupuncture and neurology, explains that 
acupuncture alters the sense of touch thereby altering feeling by its effect on 
&ldquo;somatosensory sympathetic, or somatovisceral reflexes, as well as 
improved circulation&rdquo;4 -- yielding pain management. He comments, 
&ldquo;if [acupuncture] is not real, then it should not affect the nervous 
system, excite NTS nucleus to inhibit sympathetic tone, release endorphins, or 
work with periaqueductal gray &acirc;&#128;&#147; all of which acupuncture does 
play a role.&rdquo;4<br>
</p> 
<p>&Acirc;&nbsp;&Acirc;&nbsp;&Acirc;&nbsp;&Acirc;&nbsp; In Dr. Oleson&rsquo;s 
research with periaqueductal gray in the midbrain, it was observed that when a 
microcurrent excites this part of the brain, animals feel no pain. In the 
&ldquo;Tail Flick Test,&rdquo; rodents&rsquo; tails were exposed to a heat 
lamp. With excitation of their midbrains, the rats did not move their tails off 
the lamp. More latency is seen with an increase of morphine and with stimulus 
of periaqueductal gray. This analgesic effect is also seen when using 
acupuncture. If periaqueductal gray is destroyed, neither acupuncture nor 
morphine works, suggesting acupuncture uses an opiate system in the brain that 
needs to sense pain before the pain can be turned off.<br>
</p> 
<p>&Acirc;&nbsp;&Acirc;&nbsp;&Acirc;&nbsp;&Acirc;&nbsp; Thus, needles inserted 
into the body activate neural pathways locally, and send impulses to the spinal 
cord which ascend to the contralateral side of the brain. The signal goes to 
the centromedian nucleus of the thalamus (for general pain), and into the 
preoptic area into the pituitary gland (where endorphins are secreted into the 
general bloodstream). The signal for analgesia travels back down the spinal 
cord to specific locations having prescribed somatovisceral therapeutic effects.
<br></p> 
<p>&Acirc;&nbsp;&Acirc;&nbsp;&Acirc;&nbsp;&Acirc;&nbsp; Other medical 
practitioners are demystifying acupuncture to better comprehend its potent pain 
relief. Sheng-Xing Ma, MD, PhD, associate professor at UCLA, David Geffen 
School of Medicine, summarizes &ldquo;acupuncture point, &acirc;&#128;&#152;St 
36&rsquo;, decreases heart blood pressure and heart rate.&rdquo;5 He notes 
&ldquo;L-arginine derived NO [nitric oxide] in the gracile nucleus and mNTS 
[medial portion nucleus tractus solitarius] mediates CV reflex responses to 
electro-stimulation at acupuncture point, &acirc;&#128;&#152;St 
36&rsquo;.&rdquo;5 He describes the dorsal-medulla-thalamic tract to be the 
important pathway for acupuncture signals. Up-regulation of nNOS-NO [neuronal 
NO synthase] in the pathways mediates the non-opioid effects of 
electro-stimulation at acupuncture point, &acirc;&#128;&#152;St 36&rsquo;.6 <br>
</p> 
<p>&Acirc;&nbsp;&Acirc;&nbsp;&Acirc;&nbsp;&Acirc;&nbsp; Dr. Ma&rsquo;s 
research shows NO is generated from the skin surface with a high level 
existence at acupuncture points and possibly at meridians lines. Thus, Dr. Ma 
concludes NO modifies skin electricity which creates low resistance 
characteristics for acupuncture points, raises the conductance, increases 
signal flow and the therapeutic effect.<br>
</p> 
<p>&Acirc;&nbsp;&Acirc;&nbsp;&Acirc;&nbsp;&Acirc;&nbsp; Peng Li, MD, LAc, 
staff member at Susan Samueli Center of Integrative Medicine, School of 
Medicine, UC Irvine, in researching pain control via obtaining &ldquo;de 
qi&rdquo; stated &ldquo;the effects of acupuncture depend on acupoints, 
stimulation parameters, and the situation of patients. The effects of 
acupuncture and &rsquo;de qi&rsquo; (meaning the patient feels sensation upon 
needle insertion) working via the central nervous system and the release of 
neurotransmitters serve to alleviate pain.&rdquo;7<br>
</p> 
<p>&Acirc;&nbsp;&Acirc;&nbsp;&Acirc;&nbsp;&Acirc;&nbsp; Acupuncture Today 
published an article titled, CDC Report: Americans in Pain. The CDC reported 
remarkable findings in its 2006 National Health Interview release about pain in 
American patients that raised questions regarding quality of life versus 
quantity of life.<br>
</p> 
<p>&Acirc;&nbsp;&Acirc;&nbsp;&Acirc;&nbsp;&Acirc;&nbsp; Investigating life 
quality, this author was particularly curious to learn what U.S. adults are 
doing for their pain. The report observed a yardstick through the use of 
prescription narcotics, with eye-opening findings. &quot;Between 1988-1994 and 
1999-2002, the age-adjusted percentage of women reporting narcotic drug use in 
the month prior to interview increased by almost one-half, from 3.6% to 5.3% . 
. . rose by almost 75% among women 45-65 years of age, to 5.7%; and by more 
than 50% among women 65 years and over, to 6.8%.&rdquo;8 <br>
</p> 
<p>&Acirc;&nbsp;&Acirc;&nbsp;&Acirc;&nbsp;&Acirc;&nbsp; And what are people 
using pain medication mostly for?<br>
</p> 
<p>&Acirc;&nbsp;&Acirc;&nbsp;&Acirc;&nbsp;&Acirc;&nbsp; The report tracked low 
back pain, migraine/severe headache, neck pain, and facial ache in the jaws. 
For adults 18 years and older, low back pain was the most frequently cited, the 
most common cause of job-related disability, and a leading contributor to 
reduced productivity. Also noted was that women across the board reported 
experiencing low back pain more often than men.<br>
</p> 
<p>&Acirc;&nbsp;&Acirc;&nbsp;&Acirc;&nbsp;&Acirc;&nbsp; Severe 
headache/migraine was the second most chronic pain type. &ldquo;In 2004, 15% of 
adults reported . . . severe headache and neck pain. Adults 18 to 44 years of 
age reported migraine/severe headache pain almost three times as frequently as 
adults 65 years and older.&rdquo;9 Women in their reproductive years are 
particularly prone to experiencing severe headaches. Also revealed in the 
report was the predictable finding that severe joint pain increases with age, 
with knee joint pain most common, followed by pain in the shoulder, fingers and 
hips.<br>
</p> 
<p>&Acirc;&nbsp;&Acirc;&nbsp;&Acirc;&nbsp;&Acirc;&nbsp; In the article titled, 
CDC Report:&Acirc;&nbsp; Americans in Pain, it was stated:<br>
</p> 
<p>&Acirc;&nbsp;&Acirc;&nbsp;&Acirc;&nbsp;&Acirc;&nbsp; The impact of pain, 
particularly chronic pain, is far-reaching. . . . In fact, pain is such a 
prominent health care issue that the 106th U.S. Congress recently passed Title 
VI, Sec. 1603, of H.R. 3244, declaring the period between Jan. 1, 2001 and Dec. 
31, 2010 the &rsquo;Decade of Pain Control and Research.&rsquo;9<br>
</p> 
<p>&Acirc;&nbsp;&Acirc;&nbsp;&Acirc;&nbsp;&Acirc;&nbsp; As Americans are 
living longer, frustration with conventional approaches to pain management is 
evident. In fact, the CDC report speculates that pain among older adults often 
goes unreported due to many simply giving up, &rsquo;and skepticism about the 
beneficial effects of potential treatments.&rsquo; With so many Americans in 
pain and dissatisfied with conventional treatment options, acupuncture and 
other alternative health professions may have a real opportunity to take the 
lead in a new era of pain management.9<br>
</p> 
<p>&Acirc;&nbsp;&Acirc;&nbsp;&Acirc;&nbsp;&Acirc;&nbsp; Acupuncture 
Today&rsquo;s Associate Editor, Julie Engebretson, notes &ldquo;While the 
overall health of the nation seems to be improving or holding steady in many 
areas, results from the National Health Interview survey highlights the need 
for appropriate management of one particular condition: pain.&rdquo;9<br>
</p> 
<p>&Acirc;&nbsp;&Acirc;&nbsp;&Acirc;&nbsp;&Acirc;&nbsp; It is the opinion of 
the author, as more research focuses on and documents acupuncture&rsquo;s 
effectiveness, Western understanding and acceptance of this ancient art will 
become widespread. Eastern practitioners functioning alongside their Western 
medical counterparts will provide the general public with more access to 
Chinese medicine in conventional healthcare settings -- hospitals, community 
clinics, and medical offices.<br>
</p> 
<p>&Acirc;&nbsp;&Acirc;&nbsp;&Acirc;&nbsp;&Acirc;&nbsp; In order for this step 
to happen, research needs to prove the cost effectiveness of this ancient 
medical system. One example might be studies designed to show how acupuncture 
reduces the length of hospital visits which would be well received by insurance 
companies responsible for paying for exorbitant inpatient care, and by 
patients, who would prefer to recuperate in the comfort of their own homes.<br>

</p> 
<p>&Acirc;&nbsp;&Acirc;&nbsp;&Acirc;&nbsp;&Acirc;&nbsp; More research into the 
efficacy of acupuncture and Chinese medicine is critical for acceptance by U.S. 
mainstream insurance companies. With billions of dollars annually paid 
out-of-pocket by Americans for alternative healthcare, this creates a market to 
modify the current arrangement for insurance-covered modalities.<br>
</p> 
<p>&Acirc;&nbsp;&Acirc;&nbsp;&Acirc;&nbsp;&Acirc;&nbsp; Two other worthy 
research subjects include exploring what medical discipline excels in treating 
specific types of pain, and when is it best to use one discipline over the 
other. When looking to build something strong and long-lasting, it is wise to 
begin by examining all of the parts to decide what goes where and in what order.
<br></p> 
<p>&Acirc;&nbsp;&Acirc;&nbsp;&Acirc;&nbsp;&Acirc;&nbsp; In conclusion, Eastern 
and Western medicines have their strengths and weaknesses. When medical 
practitioners are well educated in both systems, the result can only be 
positive. Acquiring a neuro-physiological understanding of the mechanics of 
acupuncture plus comprehension of the nature and etiology of pain through 
scientific studies and clinical trials in China and elsewhere, a greater 
perception and acceptance of acupuncture&rsquo;s effectiveness could be 
fostered, thereby opening the door to providing millions of Americans with 
effective pain relief.<br>
