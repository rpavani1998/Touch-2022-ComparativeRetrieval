<h2>What is Complementary Medicine?</h2> <br>

<p>Complementary medicine is becoming popular in western world, every year 
millions of consultation is taking place and statistics says that one in every 
three persons have tried it. It is really helpful for chronic conditions which 
could not be treated with other medications.</p> 
<p>Now it is widely accepted in orthodox medicines that doctors are either 
trained in this or referring patients to complementary therapies or 
incorporating complementary therapist into their practice. So, nowadays 
complementary medicine is very common in specialists, hospitals, gyms, schools, 
beauty clinics.</p> 
<p>While this form of medicine has become popular, patients are asking for its 
effectiveness and safety. Hence complementary medicine practitioners are well 
trained and their professional associations are working hard to raise the 
standards.Complementary medicine was once called as alternative medicine as it 
was treated as alternative to orthodox, allopathic medicine.</p> 
<p>Few accepted alternative medicine terminology while others felt that is 
forming a barrier between complementary and orthodox medicine while both can 
work very well together. Hence the name complementary medicine came into 
picture.</p> 
<p>So what forms complementary medicine? ancient traditions provides root to 
this like the medical systems of India, China, Tibet. While the argument 
continues that these medications like Traditional Chinese medicines should not 
be considered as alternative medicines as they were practiced for thousands of 
years. But their revitalization puts them in modern health care approach firmly.
</p> 
<p>Complementary therapies are developed from ancient roots such as 
acupuncture from Traditional Chinese medicine while others like osteopathy 
developed recently from the work of an US army doctor.</p> 
<p>Osteopathy, chiropractic, acupuncture, herbalism and homeopathy are well 
established in UK while naturopathy is also well established in US, Germany and 
Australia. Few other therapies like nutritional therapy is also growing popular.
</p> 
<p>Osteopathy and Chiropractic have become mainstream in UK as they are 
regulated by law and included in medical insurance practiced on the National 
Health Service. It is referred for health problems such as back and neck pain 
by the practitioners. As a matter of fact for some people this is considered as 
professions allied to medicine.</p> 
<p>Controversy exists with complementary medicines too particularly on 
homeopathy developed in 18th century in Germany whether it is all in mind or 
really does it work? Cranial osteopathy a subtle form of osteopathy is also in 
question.</p> 
<p>Crystal, color, and light therapy even though has committed and serious 
practitioner is considered as weird and wacky.</p>
