<h2>All complementary medicine is placebo? Gimme a break!</h2> Share <br>
Tweet
<br> <br>

<p>A recent article published in the Economist (May 19, 2011) entitled 
&ldquo;Think Yourself Better&rdquo; claims that all alternative medical 
treatments are mere placebos designed to bilk the consumer out of an estimated 
$60 billion per year spent on alternative medicine (based on 2008 estimates).
</p> 
<p>The article is based on the single opinion of a Dr Edzard Ernst, who 
retires from his 18-year professorship at Peninsula Medical School in southwest 
England in May. Described by the author as the world&rsquo;s first professor of 
complementary medicine, it seems that all Dr. Ernst can say to sum up his 
findings is that nearly all alternative medicine -- indiscriminately lumping 
the entire kit and caboodle including acupuncture, herbal medicine, Ayurvedic 
medicine, homeopathy, crystal healing, reiki, and flower essences -- are mere 
placebo.</p> 
<p>Well thank you Dr. Ernst, and goodbye!</p> 
<p>It is a well-known fact that 40 to 60 percent of medical procedures and 
drugs is claimed to be due to placebo. In light of this, it seems reasonable 
that one would prefer to &ldquo;think him/herself better&rdquo; with herbs, 
acupuncture, homeopathy, TCM or Ayurveda that has a long, sound record of 
safety and efficacy unmatched by invasive medical procedures and drugs that are 
extremely expensive with a high probability of adverse reactions.</p> 
<p>For example, statin drugs taken to lower cholesterol cause a high number of 
people to develop symptoms of rhabdomyalgia, chronic acute muscle pain caused 
by a breakdown of muscle fibers. Instead, one might avoid such a horrible side 
effect by taking the Ayurvedic herb guggul or a garlic supplement. If 
necessary, red yeast rice lowers cholesterol with no adverse reactions.</p> 
<p>Or, perhaps in lieu of an open heart bypass surgery, one might take 
hawthorn and/or arjuna herb supplement. Many of you might think I&rsquo;ve 
taken things too far with this one.I refer you to an article by Dr. Jonathan 
Wright published in January 2004, reporting that Dr. Henry McIntosh, a highly 
respected cardiologist at Baylor University, observing the results of heart 
bypass surgery over the course of 15 years, said, &ldquo;Despite a low 
operative mortality and rate of graft closure, available data in the literature 
do not indicate that myocardial infarctions, arrhythmias or congestive heart 
failure will be prevented, or that life will be prolonged in the vast majority 
of patients.&rdquo;Similar opinion is shared by Dr. Howard H. Wayne M.D. of the 
Non-Invasive Heart Center in San Diego, California, and the same sentiments 
were reflected in an article in a July, 2008 article in Business Week Magazine 
entitled&ldquo;Is Heart Surgery Worth It?&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Would you rather relieve back pain with acetaminophen, the OTC drug that is 
known to injure your already beleaguered liver, or with turmeric or willow bark 
which relieves inflammation and pain with no side effects? You should know that
acetaminophen drugs such as Tylenol send 56,000 people to the hospital 
emergency ward with a reported 458 deaths a year caused by liver failure.</p> 
<p>Finally, did you know that correctly prescribed medical treatment and 
pharmaceutical drugs are the fourth leading cause of death in the U.S., with up 
to 106,000 deaths a year? The third leading cause is blatant medical 
malpractice, according to the prestigiousJournal of American Medicine 
Association (JAMA).</p> 
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to make this an either-or, bash the medical 
establishment article, but when a leading magazine publishes such poorly 
considered schlock, I think we need to speak up for our side -- a side, by the 
way, that much of the medical profession is slowly coming to validate.</p> 
<p>For the remaining unbelievers, following are a number of randomized 
placebo-controlled, double-blind studies for herbs, acupuncture and homeopathy 
that Dr. Ernst should have come across during his 18 year spot as professor of 
complementary medicine &ndash; but as we now know, he didn&rsquo;t.</p> 
<p><strong>Herb studies:</strong></p> 
<p><em>Tripterygerium wilfordii,</em> a.k.a. Thunder god vine, for rheumatoid 
arthritis</p> 
<p>Buckwheat for leg edema</p> 
<p>Lemon balm for Alzheimer's disease</p> 
<p>Ginger for nausea in pregnancy</p> 
<p>Celandine and angelica for IBS</p> 
<p>Andrographis for colds and upper respiratory infections</p> 
<p>Chinese herbs for atopic dermatitis in infants</p> 
<p>Chamomile and fennel for infant colic (this is published in a respected and 
credible journal dedicated to phytotherapy research)</p> 
<p>Chinese herbal formula Rehmannia Eight for senile dementia</p> 
<p>Chinese herbal formula Free and Easy Wanderer for depression and bipolar 
disorders</p> 
<p>Passionflower for post-operative anxiety</p> 
<p>Common sage for Alzheimer's</p> 
<p>Milk thistle for diabetes</p> 
<p><strong>Acupuncture studies:</strong></p> 
<p>Acupuncture helps with fibromyalgia symptoms &ndash; Mayo clinic:</p> 
<p>Acupuncture relieves back pain &ndash; University of Maryland study</p> 
<p>Acupuncture for the immune system study</p>

<h2>EU Set to Ban Hundreds of Herbal Remedies in 2011</h2> Share <br>
Tweet 
<br> <br>
<br>

<p>An article published in the UK&nbsp;<em>Independent</em> on Dec. 30, 2010, 
reports:<strong>&ldquo;From 1 May 2011, traditional herbal medicinal products 
must be licensed or prescribed by a registered herbal practitioner to comply 
with an EU directive passed in 2004.&rdquo;</strong></p> 
<p>The reason given for the directive is a purportedly &ldquo;rising concern 
over adverse effects caused by herbal medicines.&rdquo; The fact that this 
reason is given for the regulations reflects not only issues with herb safety 
but also the herbal community&rsquo;s inability to unilaterally effectively 
address these concerns.<strong>Bickering factions among individual herbalists 
and herbal organizations have crippled their ability to self-regulate, 
resulting in regulations imposed by governmental agencies.</strong></p> 
<p>While the new law requires registration and licensing of individual herbal 
products and does not directly regulate the practice of herbal medicine, it 
will certainly affect herbalists in the EU. In most European countries, herbs 
are dispensed by medical doctors or individuals licensed in particular healing 
professions like Traditional Chinese Medicine and so forth. But<strong>if one 
is not a registered herbal practitioner &ndash; for which no registry has yet 
been created &ndash; one will no longer be able to dispense the hundreds of 
still-unlicensed herbal products.</strong>(For a bit of perspective, here is a 
World Health Organization listing of how EU countries regulated herbal medicines
 compiled in 2005.)</p> 
<p>Under the new law, the EU has basically succumbed to the dispensing of 
herbs by medical doctors. However, even with the more extensive training in 
herbal medicine that German medical doctors evidently receive, it is 
questionable that they are skilled in the finer aspects of herbal prescribing 
that is an essential part of the art of traditional herbal systems throughout 
the world.</p> 
<p>What finer aspects are these, you may ask? It&rsquo;s the difference 
between deciding to prescribe an herb such as willow bark as an alternative to 
acetaminophen for a headache or choosing to prescribe an herbal compound that 
addresses both the headache as well as its underlying cause.</p> 
<p>Failure to address the underlying cause of disease results in the 
widespread use and abuse of stronger synthetic alternatives. In fact, as much 
as 80% of all drugs are either derived from herbs or synthetic compounds found 
in plants. The reason for the plethora of drug side effects is precisely 
because of their concentration and the focus being largely directed to muffling 
symptoms rather than promoting rejuvenation and cure.</p> 
<p>Because people have become aware of these undesirable side effects and 
dangerous risks, they have come to rely on herbs. In fact,<strong>the main 
reason people turn to herbs, supplements and alternative healing methods is 
because of well-founded fears regarding the adverse reactions to drugs and some 
medical interventions.</strong></p> 
<p>The herbal product regulations in the EU require that companies selling 
undergo similar licensing requirements as pharmaceutical drugs. Considering 
that there are literally thousands of medicinal herbs throughout the world with 
which people have had a long history of safe use, and that there are infinite 
combinations of herbal formulas that oftentimes make for more effective 
products,<strong>it is both impractical and unrealistic that a company should 
invest millions of dollars to license each of their herbs and herbal formulas.
</strong> This is not to mention the inevitable prohibitive ultimate cost to 
consumers for these products. I agree with the critics of the move to ban herbs 
in the EU when they say that this is indeed &ldquo;disproportionate and 
discriminatory.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>To restrict the sale of such common herbs as cascara sagrada, an herbal 
laxative; skullcap, an herbal sedative; and ashwagandha, a whole body tonic 
that increases health and libido which are only a few of the 100s of herbs that 
will be banned from sale starting in May shows flagrant disregard to the 
public&rsquo;s reliance on these and other safe herbal products and discourages 
people from finding alternatives to the high cost of conventional medical care.
</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<h2>What about the United States?</h2> 
<p><strong>Attitudes similar to the ones that led to the restriction of herbs 
in the EU, namely that the herbal and nutritional supplement industry is 
dangerously unregulated, are also present in the United States.</strong> Upon 
closer examination one may discover that the industry in the U.S. is subject to 
unannounced inspections by the FDA leveling severe fines on herbal companies 
who fail to follow stringent GMP (Good Manufacturing Practice) guidelines 
established both by the herbal industry itself along with the FDA. Recognizing 
the regulatory difficulties involved, the United States enacted what may be one 
of the most popular legislations in US history, the Dietary Supplement Health 
and Education Act of 1994 (DSHEA). This established the regulation of herbs and 
supplements in a separate class from drugs.</p> 
<p>But if they don't stand united and agree on a method of self-regulation, 
U.S. herbalists may find themselves in the same kind of quandary that those in 
the E.U. face today.</p> 
<p>The American Herbalists Guild is the single herbal organization that has 
come closest to creating standards for professional clinical herbal practice in 
the United States. For over 20 years it has done much good for the profession, 
but one of the problems it has consistently encountered is attempting to appeal 
to and represent all the individual and sometimes quirky styles of herbalism 
that exist in the U.S. Nevertheless, it has a five-person peer review 
admissions board whose objective is to screen for and accept only professional 
applicants who meet the rigorous standards set forth by the AHG for its members.
</p> 
<p>At the AHG's inception, a number of respected herbalists were granted 
professional membership based on their prior experience. Recognizing the need 
for such an organization, most of these herbalists responded to the call, and 
thus the AHG has grown over the course of its 22 years in existence. Some, 
however, saw the formation of the AHG as a threat to herbal medicine and an 
herbalists' &quot;civil war&quot; ensued. The AHG had no intention of limiting 
the practice of herbal medicine but to establish professional standards of 
practice for its members and by so doing advance the profession of medical 
herbalism in America.</p> 
<p>Several years ago, foreseeing possible developments restricting herbal 
medicine as is now occurring in the E.U., some of the members of the AHG tried 
to create a &quot;Traditional Medicines Category&quot; to protect our access to 
important medicinal herbs just in case such restrictions would be implemented 
in the U.S. When this endeavor was met by stiff opposition from &quot;olde 
garde&quot; herbalists, some members of the AHG felt that the project needed to 
be abandoned and so it was. Without such a protected category in place these 
herbs may one day be banned not only from the public but also from 
practitioners.</p> 
<p><strong>In view of the course taken by the E.U. and the highly restrictive 
climate of these times, herbalists in the United States should really consider 
this a wake-up call. What can we do to prevent the same from happening to us?
</strong></p> 
<p>It is difficult at this point to not descend into the typical &lsquo;us 
against them&rsquo; polemic but when apparently discriminatory repressive 
measures are taken against herbal medicines based on a very small number of 
reported incidents while far greater concerns regarding adverse drug reactions 
exist worldwide, it is impossible to not refer to the following statistics in 
order to frame a context for discussion.</p> 
<p>An oft-cited statistic comes from&nbsp;a 1995 study based on the United 
States alone that describes an average 106,000 deaths per year from adverse 
drug reactions at a cost of $12 billion. Further, when combined with all other 
iatrogenic causes (caused by drugs and medical treatment) of injuries and 
deaths, the total rises to 16.4 million people who are affected with costs 
modestly estimated to be well over $300 billion a year.</p> 
<p><strong>In comparison with these statistics, the percentage of deaths and 
injuries from herbs and natural medicines is minuscule.</strong>&nbsp;The 
Natural Health Federation (NHF) reports that &ldquo;There was not even one 
death caused by a dietary supplement in 2008, according to the most recent 
information collected by the U.S. National Poison Data System.&rdquo; This was 
based on polls of 61 poison centers who provide coast-to-coast data for the 
U.S. National Poison Data System, which is then reviewed by 29 medical and 
clinical toxicologists.</p> 
<p><strong>While there are no immediate signs that such regulations will 
extend to the United States, there is reason for concern that with the 
heightened atmosphere toward increased regulation generally, it could become a 
concern for those who rely on herbal supplements in the United States.</strong>
</p> 
<p>Therefore I urge that that we stand in solidarity with our European 
counterparts by<strong>signing the petition to stop the European Traditional 
Herbal Medicinal Products Directive:&nbsp;</strong>

<h2>Does the U.S. really have the greatest healthcare system in the world?</h2>
Share <br>
Tweet <br>
<br>

<p>My friend Don Monkerud recently sent me his periodic political critique 
which included the following:</p> 
<p>&ldquo;Corporate controlled politicians claim America has &lsquo;the 
greatest healthcare system in the world,&rsquo; only to reveal their ignorance. 
The World Health Organization ranked the U.S. 37th among nations in healthcare 
performance in 2000, although we pay more for less service. Numerous studies 
reveal that the U.S. is mediocre in treating illness. For example, compared to 
the G8, the U.S. has the highest infant mortality, the most mothers who die 
during childbirth, the most lives lost that could have been saved, and the 
worst in treatment of cancer. The U.N. rates the U.S. even worse: 74th in 
healthcare performance. And in 2009, the C.I.A. ranked the U.S. 49th in life 
expectancy in the world.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Each day we read about phenomenal medical breakthrough research. 
Doesn&rsquo;t it ever occur to the large numbers who voted the present 
Conservative regime into dominance in the House that these discoveries are 
hardly ever available to the majority of average Americans, who are unable to 
afford health insurance or who have health insurance from companies who can 
deny coverage for any number of trumped-up reasons?</p> 
<p>While Republicans believe in unrestrained capitalism, the wishy-washy 
Democrats (for whom I nevertheless have more sympathy) have their own 
considerable deficiencies and weaknesses which have a particular impact on 
natural health and healing. To wit, their out-of-control protectionism and 
tendency to play &lsquo;big brother&rsquo; causes them to side with the 
ill-informed majority against the natural health movement. Do I hear a need for 
a third, possibly even as many six parties out there (as they apparently have 
in Canada)?</p> 
<p>The choice of either/or in anything is hardly ever a good one, but neither 
is simply having to choose between the lesser of two evils or, as many do, 
leave off choosing altogether when neither option offers a decent outcome.</p> 
<p>I wish I could end this diatribe with a solution, but frankly I have none 
to offer. I encourage you to leave your thoughts in the comments section of 
this post.</p> 
<p>I do have a suggestion, however: keep growing and learning about medicinal 
herbs, self-help and alternative natural healing. Most of us are not likely to 
find the kind of healing we deserve and need from mainstream medicine.</p> <br>

<h2>Forget H1N1; The real world health threat is Big Pharma</h2> Share <br>

Tweet <br>
<br>

<p>Almost exactly one year ago today, I published a blog post, 
&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s Afraid of the Big Bad Flu,&rdquo; about the <strong>
corporate-made H1N1 fraud.</strong></p> 
<p>Now, according to Digital Online, the German news source <em>Der Spiegel
</em> published an exhaustive article describing how 30 representatives of Big 
Pharma met with&nbsp;WHO Director-General Chan and United Nations Secretary 
General Ban Ki Moon at WHO headquarters for the sole purpose of discussing how 
to move the H1N1 threat to a phase 6 or pandemic level.&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Once upon a time, the term &ldquo;pandemic&rdquo; represented a 
critical worldwide health threat; somehow it was downgraded to simply mean a 
world disease.</strong>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Hopefully this will awaken more people to the&nbsp;threat of&nbsp;the 
takeover of the world's economies by multi-national corporations generally, and 
by Big Pharma in particular.</p> 
<p>Few of us can fathom the threat posed by these companies. Having no 
allegiance to any country and so glutted with wealth, they can shift at will, 
moving their base from one part of the globe to another. In this way, they are 
able to benefit from lower operational costs and can bypass national 
regulations because international regulations,&nbsp;are weaker and&nbsp;more 
difficult to enforce. While this is true to an alarming extent for all large 
corporations, it is especially an issue with Big Pharma, whose particular power 
can hold the people of the world hostage to their mostly &ldquo;toxic&rdquo; 
wares.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>The <em>Der Spiegel</em> expos&eacute;, depicting Big Pharma's 
ability to cloud and influence the judgment of the director of the World Health 
Organization and of the United Nations for their personal profit, vividly 
illustrates the power and persuasion unique to that industry.</strong> It also 
makes credible the stories that assert, based on an analysis of the DNA strands 
of the H1N1 virus showing origin from various parts of the world, that the 
virus was deliberately created giving this entire hoax an even more Orwellian 
dimension than most of us are able or willing to embrace.</p> <br>

<h2>UK set for herbal regulation? Say it ain't so!</h2> Share <br>
Tweet <br>

<br> 
<p>This Dec. 1, 2009, article at the BBC website entitled &quot;Prince 
Charles: 'Herbal medicine must be regulated'&quot; points to a potential crisis 
for the practice of herbal medicine in the UK.<strong>Under threat of new 
European Union (EU) laws scheduled to take effect in April 2011 that would 
restrict the prescription of manufactured herbal medicines to &quot;statutorily 
regulated professionals like doctors,&quot; the Prince of Wales is urging his 
government to regulate herbalists, lest they be banned from practice entirely 
when the new laws take effect.</strong> The new laws also stipulate that the 
only herbal medicines that will be sold over the counter will be ones used to 
treat &quot;'mild and self-limiting' conditions - basically meaning nothing 
worse than a cold.&#157;</p> 
<p>Apart from the fact <strong>that this would undoubtedly cause a large 
legally disenfranchised body of people to seek natural remedies through illegal 
venues,</strong> it also would overturn a 500 year-old Commonwealth law that 
prohibits governmental legal restriction enabling anyone to treat patients with 
herbs.</p> 
<p>Since 1542, the Commonwealth Charter of Henry VIII has guaranteed 
herbalists the right to practice freely throughout the Commonwealth. This law 
is still applied in the UK as well as its former territories worldwide such as 
Australia and New Zealand. In fact, many think an argument could be made that 
the U.S.A., as a former British colony, has a legal basis for unregulated and 
free practice based on the English Herbalists' Charter.</p> 
<p>For over 400 years, this has worked pretty well with very few adverse 
incidents reported, especially compared to those reported about conventional 
mainstream medicine. Other European countries such as Germany and France have 
chosen to impose highly restrictive laws limiting the practice of herbal 
medicine to medical doctors. As a result,<strong> there is economic pressure 
for the UK to declare the Herbalists' Charter antiquated and to get in step 
with the same restrictions imposed by other European countries.</strong>This 
has met with stiff opposition from a well established tradition that has 
allowed for the comparatively unrestricted practice of herbal medicine by both 
lay and professional herbalists.</p> 
<p>Aside from the many differences of language, culture and history between 
closely adjoining countries, the standards for the practice of herbal medicine 
is yet another obstacle to true union. With obvious financial advantages to 
globalization in respect to the EU, many of the differences between these 
financially interdependent countries must be resolved -- and apparently how 
herbal medicine is practiced and regulated is just another one of those issues. 
Countries such as the UK with a long history of distinctive customs and 
traditions encounter difficulties with conformity. For instance, while most 
European countries have converted their currency to the Euro, the UK still uses 
the pound sterling as its distinctive &quot;coin of the realm.&quot; So far, 
under the Herbalists' Charter, the UK is similarly seen as 'not fully 
participatory.'</p> 
<p><strong>The upshot of all of this is an ongoing fundamental conflict as to 
how herbal medicine is practiced, manufactured and sold between the UK and its 
European Union partners.</strong></p> 
<p>One of my former students, John Smith, is now a professional herbalist in 
the UK who opposes licensure and restrictions of herbalists in that country. In 
discussion on this issue he recently wrote me the following:</p> 
<p><em>Unfortunately, what has been happening in UK is that it was felt by the 
powers that be that herbal medicine either had to be regulated or banned 
entirely -- so herbal bodies agreed to compromise and go for self regulation 
(i.e. Herbal Registers). (In other words,) we&quot;d get together to exclude 
non registered or unqualified practitioners and agree on what herbs could and 
could not be used, etcetera). This was done even though many of us saw such 
negotiations as a huge compromise but the lesser of two evils. Ten years of 
time and energy went into this regulation process internal wrangling for power 
and influence within the herbal and alternative medical community and 
discussions with the Department of Health and European Union representatives.
<strong>What is happening at present is that the government has pulled the plug 
and left herbal medicine back at square one where herbal medical practice could 
be banned entirely.</strong> Prince Charles, a long time proponent of herbal 
medicine, homeopathy, and alternative medical practice, has chosen the path of 
supporting the regulated practice of herbal medicine and fights that corner.
</em></p> 
<p><strong>Any decision in the EU and UK to restrict herbal medicine to 
licensed medical doctors would be a purely financial one with no regard for the 
needs of the people.</strong> At the same time it supports an already 
established free socialized medicine of a particular state-supported brand, 
administered only by licensed medical doctors.</p> 
<p>Preserving the Tradition of Herbal Medicine</p> 
<p><strong>Here are three good reasons why herbal medicine should remain as 
unregulated as possible:</strong></p> 
<ol> 
<li><strong>The roots of herbal medicine are empirical and depend on a stream 
of trial and error to evolve and renew.</strong> To do this, <strong>it must 
remain an inalienable right to be able to access and use herbs obtained in the 
market, from nature and the garden,</strong> and should not be subject to 
highly restrictive governmental regulations.</li> 
<li><strong>The practice of herbal medicine is its own unique methodology that 
only experienced herbalists understand.</strong> Because most herbs are mild 
and have myriad non-specific biochemical elements, best results are achieved 
when an assessment methodology is used that takes into account not only the 
presenting symptoms but the underlying causes.<strong>This is the unique 
strength of traditional herbal medical use and practice.</strong></li> 
<li>Further, conventional medicine has a different focus, useful in its own 
way to attend to the alleviation of symptoms irrespective of wholistic 
considerations and of course in crisis care. But<strong>most medical doctors 
have, at best, an extremely limited understanding of the practice of herbal 
medicine.</strong></li> </ol> 
<p>Because of the above stated reasons, both China and India, which have long 
standing traditions of herbal medicine, are able to recognize professional 
herbalists without prohibiting the accessibility to herbs and herbal 
preparations and the popular practice of herbal medicine by all.</p> 
<p>It seems either a poor compromise or simply naive for Prince Charles to 
promote restrictions on herbal medical practice in the UK similar to those now 
in effect in other European countries. The compromise, which is the financial 
advantage, is probably more the reason as I can&quot;t imagine that someone has 
not discussed these other matters with him.</p> 
<p>Who else stands to gain from herbal regulation and restriction?</p> 
<p><strong>Commingled with EU financial considerations to override the UK 
Commonwealth law and the 1542 Herbalists' Charter is the protection and 
practice of healing professions.</strong> Of course this includes conventional 
Western medicine but also the practioners of newer recognized alternative 
medicine professions, such as acupuncturists, herbalists, naturopaths, and 
Ayurvedic and Chinese healers who have been struggling over recent years with 
various degrees of success to gain recognition. Despite their roots as popular 
unregulated healing modalities, each of these, backed by schools standing to 
benefit from increased enrollment, at least superficially stand to gain in 
restricting practice to &quot;licensed professionals.&quot;</p> 
<p>Historically there is nothing new in any of this motivation of protection. 
Since medieval times, guilds and other organizations have been established 
specifically for promoting the professional (i.e. financial) interests of its 
members. There is something gained and something lost from this. What is gained 
is a standing organization that can share its experience and knowledge with its 
members and establish a standard of practice. What is lost, of course, is the 
wider experience that is the result of non-members who may also practice a 
particular discipline or practice such as herbal medicine.</p> 
<p>In order to safeguard its knowledge, these professional organizations 
developed their own language and jargon that distinguished them from the 
populace. We encounter this when we try to decipher the diagnostic assessments 
and prescriptions of medical doctors as well as the metaphorical jargon used by 
Traditional Chinese Medicine or Ayurvedic doctors.</p> 
<p>For example, Latin, a universal language understood by medical legal and 
scholarly professions across all European countries, was used this way. While 
at first intended for more widespread understanding and greater definition and 
clarity, the use of Latin as a professional language of medicine had the same 
effect as it did when it was used by the Church for 1,500 years where the Bible 
was only available to be read and interpreted by clergy: to prevent free 
thought.</p> 
<p>The mid-17th century English apothecary-herbalist, Nicholas Culpeper, 
caused a furor when he published his own translations from the Latin to the 
English vernacular of various herbal and medical texts of the College of 
Physicians. He did this so that his fellow countrymen who could not afford 
expensive doctors would have available to them guides for maintenance of their 
own health. He published his own herbal,<em>The English Physitian</em> (1652), 
arguing that &quot;no man deserved to starve to pay an insulting, insolent 
physician,&quot; when he could obtain his herbs from the nearby countryside. 
Culpeper upheld medicine as a &quot;public asset rather than a commercial 
secret.&quot; Since its first publication over 350 years ago, Culpeper&quot;s
<em>Complete Herbal</em> has been reprinted as many times as the Bible. He 
remains a revered iconic figure for English people and herbalists worldwide.</p>
<p>Education, not regulation</p> 
<p>Many will still argue that the unrestricted use of herbs and self treatment 
is dangerous, but the fact remains that<strong>statistics of adverse events and 
deaths from herbal treatments are infinitesimal compared to the estimated 
400,000 people who die annually from pharmaceuticals alone, or who are 
otherwise injured or made sick from conventional medicine and drugs.</strong>
</p> 
<p>It is undoubtedly my personal bias that herbal medicine remain as 
unregulated and unrestricted as reasonable. In fact, this was my personal path 
of learning. As part of a counterculture seeking independence from the 
mainstream in all ways possible, I looked to herbal medicine first as a 
passionate attraction to nature and plants, and secondly for the possibilities 
of what it might offer as an alternative to more invasive and Western medical 
drugs and procedures. It was out of this need that acupuncture and herbal 
medicine has grown in North America since the late 1960s.</p> 
<p>There were no official schools to turn to for an education on this 
continent, and if there were, I certainly did not have the financial means to 
afford them. So I made do at first with the scant few books that were available 
by Jethro Klos and a few others and tried different herbal potions on myself 
and members of the commune to which I belonged. Despite the limitations of this 
approach I learned that plants do work and found common weeds such as plantain, 
comfrey, mullein, goldenseal, and later echinacea to be amazingly effective.</p>
<p>So my career arose out of years of personal trial and effort. I eventually 
got a leg up when I began to find a few experienced herbalists such Norma 
Meyers of British Columbia and Dr. John Raymond Christopher of Provo, Utah to 
study from. This eventually extended to the study of Traditional Chinese 
Medicine and herbalism in Yunnan, China with some remarkable doctors. Through 
this path, I think I received a wonderful education. Certainly there were holes 
because of the sporadic nature of the learning process but I found that I would 
only learn what I could absorb at the time and gradually my understanding 
deepened.</p> 
<p>To legislate and deprive others from this path of learning to me would seem 
a shame of the first order.<strong>I know today, that there exists a large 
number of herbalists living in the mountains, forests and countryside who 
practice with local plants in ways that are not &quot;official&quot; according 
to accepted standards of clinical Western herbalism, TCM or Ayurveda, and that 
the contribution of these individuals are just as important as those made by 
the professionals.</strong>I think that there remains a place for both lay 
herbalists and individuals who might follow a path similar to my own as well as 
those who may seek a more set curriculum leading to professional licensure.</p>

<h2>Beyond cranberry: Simple and effective herbal treatment for urinary tract 
infections</h2> Share <br>
Tweet <br>
<br>

<p><strong>Recently a friend of mine called to say that she had a terrible 
bladder infection.</strong> Her doctor prescribed an antibiotic, but it had no 
effect; in fact, the infection worsened.<strong>She also said she tried 
drinking cranberry juice, but that had no effect on the condition either.
</strong></p> 
<p>Women's bladder infections are one of the most common complaints in the 
health world, and they probably account for the brisk sales for cranberry (<em>
Vaccinium macrocarpon,</em>pictured above) supplements. An article that 
described 10 randomized controlled trials published by Cochrane Collaboration 
in January of 2008 concluded that cranberry products may prevent recurrent 
urinary tract infections in women. I'm sure this helped boost cranberry sales 
as well as the belief that it can help a woman with a UTI.<br>
<br>
<strong>I 
wouldn't disparage the proven value of unsweetened cranberry juice, but I 
remember the study only seemed to indicate that it<em>prevented</em> recurrent 
urinary tract infections. By implication, the public and marketers read 
&quot;cure&quot; and that is an entire different realm to consider.</strong></p>
<p>There are flagrant misrepresentations in the marketplace for the use of 
herbs and various nutritional supplements, but the public also knows that these 
things, when used appropriately, can work for situations like my friend's 
antibiotic-resistant cystitis, when no standard medical procedure or tested 
natural therapy such as cranberries, do.<br>
<br>
 (Most studies, even 
preliminary trials, are expensive. We need to ask ourselves how they were 
funded, and naturally, this leads us to question who is likely to gain from the 
study. Given this, I would not be surprised that just as studies of 
pharmaceutical drugs are funded by the manufacturer, the same could be true, 
and that studies of the medicinal value of cranberries could be funded by 
cranberry growers.)</p> 
<p>But, as I stated above, cranberry didn't work for my friend, and I bet it 
doesn't work for a lot of women who've had the same problem. She turned to me 
and asked what she might do.</p> 
<p><strong>I told her about a few other herbs which I know are more powerful 
for treating bladder infections.</strong>I directed her to an <strong>uva ursi
</strong>-based formulation (generally herbal formulas are more effective for 
more people than are single herbs). Uva ursi (<em>Arctostaphylos uva ursi</em>, 
pictured at left) is not as strong as pharmaceutical-grade antibiotics and does 
not cause the same side effects. It works locally, purely with the body fluids, 
as a urinary antiseptic. It also enhances the liver's powerful role in treating 
inflammations. These actions, combined with other herbs in the formula, make 
for a more positive outcome. I also suggested the use of<strong>parsley tea
</strong> which is an old time remedy for urinary tract infections, and <strong>
cherry stems</strong> in the specific treatment of urinary tract infections.</p>
<p><strong>Cherry stems</strong> are high in potassium, salts and tannin. 
Traditionally, when women in Europe were troubled with bladder infections, they 
would steep a handful of the stems in one or two cups of boiling water and 
drink the strange-tasting brew.<strong>Lesley and I have found that cherry 
stems work for bladder infections when antibiotics and even most herbs may not.
</strong></p> 
<p>I think my friend wound up doing a combination of cherry stem tea and the 
uva ursi formula and within a couple of days her intractable urinary tract 
infection was gone.</p> 
<p><strong>In conclusion, it's good for the herbal consumer to look to the use 
of herbs as a first line treatment for most diseases. However, it's also 
important that they learn the value of different herbs and supplements in the 
event that one may not be enough, that if possible they educate themselves on 
the wise use of herbs singly and especially in formulations.</strong></p> 
<p>To that end I and my wife, Lesley, have published several books on herbal 
medicine, includingthe top-selling herb book in the world today, The Way of 
Herbs, published by Pocket Books, and Lesley's book, Healing with the Herbs of 
Life, now published by Random House. <br>
<br>
<strong>It's also obvious there 
is a need for qualified and skilled professional herbalists.</strong>Lesley and 
I personally make an effort to fulfill this need with arguablythe most 
successful course on the market, the East West Herb Course. It is partially 
correspondence and partially online, and one can complete it at his or her own 
pace. Students learn Planetary Herbology, which is a combination of the best 
global herbal systems from the Western, Ayurvedic and Chinese traditions.Check 
these and our other herbal products out elsewhere on this site.</p> <br>

<h2>Universal health care for the United States?</h2> Share <br>
Tweet <br>

<br> 
<p><strong>Have you noticed the lack of health care in your area?</strong> I 
have, in Santa Cruz.</p> 
<p><strong>So many GPs have retired</strong> because of the astronomical price 
of liability insurance they must pay to stay in practice, along with the 
mounting sheaves of paperwork they are required to maintain -- not to mention 
the expensive staff they must keep to deal with it.</p> 
<p>As if that weren't enough, a further disincentive for these doctors is the 
difficulty in getting reimbursed from insurance companies and the hoops they 
must jump through to get even a portion of what they bill. (In our clinic, 
Lesley and I simply refuse to take insurance. If people want to try to get 
reimbursed for our services from their insurance companies, they submit the 
paperwork themselves.)</p> 
<p><strong>Insurance companies today dictate what they will or will not cover; 
the basis of their decision is personal profit. It seems more than a little 
disingenuous for these companies and others to accuse a proposed hopefully 
universal health care bill that may do the same.</strong></p> 
<p>In either case, people are free to pay for services their plan will not 
cover or to seek what they believe will be better quality. As it stands, 
Americans are flocking to other countries such as Thailand or Tahiti, where 
they know they will get superior health care for a fraction of the cost 
presently in the United States.</p> 
<p>Being so closely involved with American health care for the last 35 years 
of my career, I have had plenty of opportunities to speak with people, friends 
and patients from the UK, Canada, France, and Italy who seem quite happy with 
their health care system and have come to take for granted that this is 
something that a wealthy country should provide to its citizens.</p> 
<p><strong>Recently I had first-hand experience of another nation's universal 
health care system.</strong> Last May, I took a trip to Italy with my grandson. 
During the first three days in Rome, he was very sick. I decided he should see 
a medical doctor and I was prepared to be confronted with a large bill 
comparable to what such a hospital emergency service would cost me in 
California. I didn't know that Italy had universal health care. When we went to 
be admitted for examination, few questions were asked. They looked at our 
passports, that's all. They didn't even question the fact that he wasn't my son 
and only asked about my relationship to him. It took no longer than six minutes 
or so to fill out a paper, name, age and complaint before we were put into a 
cue to be seen.</p> 
<p>He was examined by one of the few doctors in the Rome hospital who spoke 
English. We waited about two or three hours for the results of a blood test. 
When his condition was deemed not serious, the doctor wrote a prescription for 
some antibiotics and another drug that would relieve his stomach distress and 
we simply walked out the door, no further questions asked. Best of all -- we 
were not charged a single penny!<strong>In the United States, such a visit 
could have cost us anywhere from several hundred dollars to over a thousand.
</strong> To top it off, my grandson's prescription was filled for under $10!
</p> 
<p><strong>The way I see it, we've got those who can afford insurance and 
health care; then we have 46 million Americans who cannot; then we have those 
who already struggle to pay for health care and are having to deal with rising 
costs; and finally, the insurance companies, who are more concerned with bottom 
line profits for their shareholders rather than the needs of their customers.
</strong> Meanwhile,we are distracted and stalled by the question of whether or 
not the government has a right to step in.<br>
<br>
<strong>My question is, if 
the government doesn&rsquo;t step in at this point, who will?</strong><br>
<br>

 And following that,<strong>what are governments for if not to safeguard the 
vital interests of its citizens?</strong> Let's just assume that none of us 
know what the best exact plan is. But<strong>the fact remains that we need to 
get in step with all other advanced Western countries and provide universal 
health care</strong>to everyone in America -- and I mean everyone. I don't care 
if they are citizens or not. The only consideration the hospital had for my 
grandson when we were in Italy was whether or not he was a member of the human 
race.</p> 
<p><strong>We need to move health care out of profit-driven profession to a 
true enterprise founded on compassion, for all -- and in case &quot;for 
all&quot; doesn't say it, let me spell it out: I mean this to include the less 
fortunate amongst us.</strong></p> 
<p>Let's face it: the present dysfunctional health care system wrecks lives! 
If you are not covered for a medical emergency -- and as it stands, no one 
knows if they are covered until they have a need -- people have lost everything 
they have for a single serious health incident. You don't have to go very far 
from home to know about that.</p> 
<p>For example, years ago, my mother was in serious need of health care. She 
had no insurance. My brother and I both were happy and willing to help but 
neither of us was prepared to assume the full brunt of the kind of assistance 
she needed. The problem was that with the present profit-based system, if the 
government knew we were contributing any financial support, they would cut off 
their assistance entirely. As a result, we had to go and visit her in a very 
depressing facility located on the outskirts of San Diego.</p> 
<p>My son has been a nurse for decades and enjoys a hefty salary. I'm happy 
for him, but it doesn't go unnoticed by me that<strong>because a few nurses 
must receive such a generous pay and benefits, the hospitals are understaffed 
and a patient's single overnight stay could cost from $15,000 to $20,000!
</strong> It's obscene, the service is usually barely adequate -- ask anyone 
who has had a medical emergency.</p> 
<p>My son recently commented on the paperwork nurses must fill out for every 
patient. More is added each month. For instance, when he admits a patient, he 
has to fill out a form for every article the patient has when they are 
admitted. This is repeated when the patient leaves.<strong>Multiply that by 25 
or 40 papers for every patient, and you can see why health care givers are 
mostly standing behind a desk or nursing station when you visit a hospital 
rather than assisting the large number of patients supposedly under their 
care!&nbsp;</strong></p> 
<p>At present we hope and rely on insurance companies paying for such care, 
but the reality is, we are all paying for it.<strong>The hospitals have to 
charge so much because they are mandated to not turn anyone away because of 
lack of funds. &quot;Lack of funds&quot; means that they are entitled to take 
every penny you have until you<em>really</em> lack funds.</strong></p> 
<p>Further, everyone should realize that under a universal health care 
program, you still have the option to pay for whatever services may not be 
provided. It's worth paying more taxes to have it; consider it, if you will, a 
charitable contribution, if necessary. In any case, it would be cheaper than 
the present single payer system.<br>
<br>
<strong>Perhaps, like me, you have 
seen one or more of the many misleading emails that are being circulated around 
the health care issue.</strong> One entitled &quot;Health Care Reform or 
Government Take Over?&quot; urges the gullible to distrust the 
government&rsquo;s intentions to reform American health care. (I suggest that 
any statements that are made pro or con be checked with an impartial web 
organization such as http://www.politifact.com/. )</p> 
<p>When you receive bogus emails like the one mentioned above, consider how 
powerful the insurance and for-profit medical lobbies are, how they have 
congresspeople in their pockets, and how willing they are to spend millions on 
negative propaganda to prevent universal health care from happening in the 
United States.</p> 
<p><strong>My only fear at present is that the final bill will be so 
compromised that it will not accomplish what it is intended for.</strong> Can 
you even imagine how and why a newly elected president would go head-to-head 
with the most powerful lobby in the world, staking his reputation on doing what 
he and most Americans believe is the right thing to do?</p> 
<p>President Obama is not writing the bill, he is charging Congress with that 
task and will sign it after reviewing it. I can assure you that he would not 
sign a bill that reflected the stupid and unfounded charges represented by many 
anti-health care emails that are circulating.<br>
<br>
 These are my own 
personal arguments for universal health care in this country.<strong>I invite 
you to share your thoughts on this topic in the comments section of this blog.

<h2>Swine Flu: Media hype and a boon to the pharmaceutical industry</h2> Share 
<br> Tweet <br>
<br>

<h2>Who's afraid of the Big Bad Flu?</h2> 
<p>I know many of us are concerned about Swine Flu, and as I write this even 
the World Health Organization has declared a Level 5 outbreak; just one step 
away from Level 6, the highest, which is reserved for pandemics.<br>
<br>
 
Somehow it all just doesn't compute. Maybe I'm sitting here with my own 
self-made and self-proclaimed measurement yardstick, but based on all the 
information so far, it looks like the customary blend of media hype feeding off 
the public's paranoia.</p> 
<p>As of this writing there have been approximately 150 deaths and a little 
over 2,000 people supposedly infected with H1N1 virus. Even assuming unreported 
cases with double or triple that number lurking as a possibility, this still 
doesn't look anything like pandemic. Latest reports today seem to be that the 
number of deaths in Mexico have leveled off. So far in the US, there is one 
reported Mexican infant who died of the disease. The head of medicine in Mexico 
recently asserted that this viral pathogen did not even originate in Mexico but 
from Southeast Asia.</p> 
<p>There are a few scattered cases reported throughout the country and the 
world but it's still far from anything approaching pandemic proportions. 
Further, thus far there is nothing that distinguishes the so called Swine flu 
from any other flu symptoms -- except that it can only be identified by the 
Center for Disease Control (CDC).</p> 
<p>It's certainly not news that some people die from the flu. In fact in the 
US, approximately 36,000 people die each year from the flu with the worldwide 
death toll numbering into the millions.</p> Recently a number of health 
officials are beginning to cautiously question the growing hysteria around the 
growing Swine Flu hysteria. Recently on his daily networked radio show, even 
Dr. Dean Edell, an AMA loyalist if there ever was one, pointed out that over 
800 people of all ages die from the flu each week, and he questioned the amount 
of attention and media hype this latest global threat poses.<br>
<br>
 So if 
it's not as bad as it seems, why are we hearing about it every hour like it's 
going to wipe us all out?<br>
<br>
 To quote the bard, &quot;something smells 
rotten in the state of Denmark.&quot; As always, when paying attention to such 
things, consider: who stands to gain? This is what brings one back to the 
global pharmaceutical industry - the true &lsquo;pandemic' to human 
civilization if there ever was one.
<p>What is happening is that the European drug maker Roche is greatly 
increasing its production of Tamiflu with a tremendous boost in stock prices 
bankrolling millions. GlaxoSmithKline, the maker of the anti-flu drug Relenza, 
is also an investor boom with a steep increase of its stock prices.</p> 
<p>Bottom line:&nbsp;Don't get carried away by alarmist media hype, wash your 
hands often, and keep it all in perspective.</p> 
<h2><br>
 Herbs for flu prevention (Swine or otherwise)</h2> 
<p>What can one take to prevent and treat influenza? In North America, an 
extremely bitter herb known as<strong>boneset </strong>(<em>Eupatorium 
perfoliatum</em>) was traditionally used for &quot;breakbone fever,&quot; as 
the flu was called in the 19th century.<br>
<br>
 The traditional Chinese 
formula called<strong> Jade Screen (<em>Yupingfeng San</em>)</strong> was first 
described in 1481 and was used to strengthen the Wei (defensive) energy of the 
body, otherwise known in modern medical terms as the exterior immune system. 
Jade Screen consists of three herbs: astragalus (<em>Astragalus membranaceous
</em>), white atractylodes (<em>Atractylodes macrocephela</em>), and 
ledebouriella (<em>Saposhnikovia divaricata</em>). <strong>Astragalus root
</strong> has known antiviral and antibacterial properties. Like astragalus, 
<strong>white atractylodes</strong> also tonifies Qi (energy) and serves as an 
assistant or synergistic helping herb with astragalus. The herb<strong> 
ledebouriellia</strong> (<em>fang feng</em>), further dispels pathogens, i.e., 
invading bacteria and viruses, from the surface of the body (skin, nasal 
passages, mouth, lungs, etc.).</p> 
<p>Interestingly, ledebouriella is in the same Apiaceae family as the native 
North American species of ligusticum herbs such as<strong>osha</strong> (<em>
Ligusticum porteri</em>) which was used by the native and local people had a 
noticeable benefit during the 1917-1918 Spanish flu pandemic that killed tens 
of millions of people. Those who took these native herbs only got a relatively 
mild case of the flu which was deadly to most others.</p> 
<p>There is considerable supportive research that daily intake of supplemental 
<strong>vitamin D</strong> (the sunshine vitamin) is effective for preventing 
colds and flus.</p> 
<p>Finally, it is important to not allow oneself to get over tired and adhere 
to a health supporting dietary and lifestyle regime. I also recommend the 
regular daily use of<strong>probiotics</strong> to enhance the body's innate 
immune wellbeing.</p> <br>

<h2>Michael Moore, 1941-2009</h2> Share <br>
Tweet <br>
<br>

<p><strong>Michael Moore, the great Southwestern herbalist of North America, 
left his earthly dwelling for other realms on Friday, Feb. 20, 2009.</strong> 
Michael leaves us a rich legacy of herbal knowledge and wisdom, the fruit of 
over 40 years of his passionate explorations of the fundamental healing 
relationship between plants, the earth and humankind.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>I had first heard of Michael around 1967 when he and I were involved with 
the avant-garde music scene at UCLA. At the time, Michael was an accomplished 
symphonic trumpet player. True to his nature as one attracted to the more 
esoteric fringe aspect of any endeavor, Michael was not content to simply 
occupy a life chair in a symphony. Instead, he was well known as the 
unconventional musician who was open and willing to explore exciting new 
musical languages and artistic experiences.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>It just so happens that when we had our first brief encounter at a rustic 
outdoor summer fair in Topanga Canyon between Malibu Beach and San Bernardino 
in Los Angeles, Michael was already involved in another fringe movement: herbal 
medicine. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>At the time I was identified with the artistic beat culture and living in 
Venice West. I must confess, herbs and herbal medicine had not even occurred to 
me when I happened into a quaint herb stall at the fair. Herbs hung to dry from 
the eaves and various homemade potions, lotions and ointments were priced to 
sell.<strong>For some strange reason I was drawn into this medieval-looking 
tableau and was taken a little aback to see a large man with a shaggy beard 
sitting behind a counter, looking more like an LA biker than ye olde herbalist 
of yore</strong><em><strong>.</strong></em> We shared the look of the 
&lsquo;beat outlaw,' and as such we should have been kindred spirits, so to 
speak; yet, his eyes were fixed menacingly on me.</p> 
<p>I never understood why until years later, when Michael explained that he 
remembered my wandering into his booth and that he was sure I had pilfered one 
of his herbal extracts. Well, in those days I<em>might</em> have, but hardly 
from him -- I was still in my &lsquo;rebel without a cause/Robin Hood' period 
and I would hardly have stolen anything from someone who looked as disheveled 
as he did. I also distinctly remember that Michael was eager to tell people the 
then-revolutionary idea that herbs could heal body and soul, but few believed 
him, and it didn't appear that he did much business.&nbsp; Given the social 
climate for herbs and my own ignorance at the time, I half jokingly reassured 
Michael, when we became respected herbal colleagues much later, that I owed him 
no debt from that day at the fair.</p> 
<p>In retrospect, what I get from that brief encounter was that <strong>
Michael Moore was pursuing his passionate affair with herbs before I or most 
anyone knew there even was such a thing (except, of course, for<em>the </em>
herb).</strong>&nbsp; Years later we met again at a number of seminars and I 
visited his store Herbs Etcetera in Santa Fe. At the time he was teamed up with 
another giant man, Stuart Watts. Stuart and I were part of the first group of 
North American acupuncturists who went to China in the &lsquo;70s specifically 
to study Chinese herbal medicine, which was then pretty much unknown among 
non-Chinese in the West.</p> 
<p>I remember how much Michael and Stuart resembled each other in stature but 
also in the incongruity of their appearance as healers. As I mentioned in my 
first impression of Michael above, you could easily have mistaken these two as 
members of a biker gang. The fact was, they were both at the top of their game. 
Michael was never much of a business man.<strong>Like the rest of us, he didn't 
get involved with herbal medicine to get rich but was able to preach the gospel 
of herbs to anyone he encountered.</strong>From the beginning we were both 
dedicated to plying our herbal potions on those suffering from various 
ailments, who for a number of very good reasons found conventional Western 
medicine unsatisfactory. Michael mainly wanted to sell enough so he could 
continue his passion, which was to go either alone or with a small number of 
adventurous students on his herbal forays through the mountains, deserts, 
forests and canyons west of the Rocky Mountains. &nbsp;<strong>This was a 
perfect calling for Michael Moore, for various reasons.</strong></p> 
<p>You see, back in the &lsquo;70s (and even continuing up to the present day 
somewhat,) the extent of our knowledge of North American herbs might have been 
summed up with ginseng, goldenseal, sassafras and sarsaparilla, which grow east 
of the Rockies. This part of the United States was first to be settled, and it 
was settled at a time when there was a still a keen interest in herbs as 
healing agents both here and in Europe. In those days there was a lively 
exchange of information and many Eastern seaboard medicinal herbs were shipped 
off to be integrated into European medicine.&nbsp; The Chinese, hearing that 
wild ginseng was available, literally imported tons from Eastern forests so 
that the &lsquo;seng' trade rivaled the trade in furs and other wild products.
</p> 
<p>By the time the Westward expansion began to occur, interest in herbs - at 
least new herbs - was on the wane, and Native Americans, seeing how brutally 
their Eastern brethren were treated, became more and more reluctant to tell 
white settlers about the use of their native plants.<strong>So by the North 
American herbal renaissance in the mid-20th century, we herbalists knew little 
or nothing about native herbs west of the Rockies.</strong></p> 
<p><strong>Enter Michael Moore, a man whose aerophobia kept him close to his 
Southwestern home base, and who loved to get in his truck and drive to remote 
areas of the West to learn, teach and harvest herbs for his homemade potions.
</strong> Michael educated himself from whatever scientific literature was 
available, usually from &quot;journals, sources and research outside the United 
States,&quot; as he states in the introduction to his<em>Medicinal Plants of 
the Desert and Canyon West</em>. He expresses this frustration of not being 
able to find similar literature in his own country in one of his usual rants 
against the &lsquo;establishment':<strong>&quot;We are able to develop and 
finance BIG medicines; we have no method of developing and financing little 
medicines (like herbs),&quot;</strong> in contrast to countries like China and 
India, for instance. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>Michael describes our being embroiled in a &quot;grim, desperate, 
multi-billion-dollar mud-wrestling match between the public sector (the Food 
and Drug Administration) and the private sector (the 
pharmaceutical/medical/hospital industry).&quot;&nbsp; He lays the problem out 
clearly, pointing out that the initial cost of $50 million is what it takes to 
bring a drug to market, meaning that no less than a million people a day have 
to take the new drug to justify its cost. It's hardly any different today than 
it was in 1989 when this book was first published, except to say that the 
figure is probably much, much bigger.</p> 
<p>Michael goes on to say that at the time of his writing, medicine was our 
biggest industry, bigger than the Pentagon, costing us 10 percent of our Gross 
National Product.&nbsp; That was then; today not only is medicine still our 
biggest industry, but its cost has grown to 17% of our gross National Product, 
according the National Coalition on Health Care. Is it any wonder that in these 
times of deep recession we read in the news about how herb and supplement sales 
are up?</p> 
<p><strong>No herbal reference library should be considered complete without 
Michael Moore's three major books</strong>, Medicinal Plants of the Mountain 
West, Medicinal Plants of the Desert and Canyon West, and Medicinal Plants of 
the Pacific West. The first two are published by the Museum of New Mexico Press 
and the last by Red Crane Books.&nbsp; These are universally regarded as 
classics by the majority of herbalists throughout the world, not only for their 
practical descriptions of in-the-field, hands-on use of the herbs Michael 
selected, but also for his inimitable &lsquo;Kerouacian' witty writing style 
that makes his herb books a very special experience to read (a talent of which 
the rest of us who have written herb books can only be envious).Here is a link 
to all of his published books and clinical manuals.</p> 
<p>In contrast to the lucid communication provided by his books, Michael had 
an eccentric, difficult to understand stream-of-consciousness style of 
teaching. He seemed to have such a uniquely consummate understanding of Western 
biochemistry and physiology that he couldn't help but weave us dizzyingly 
through a labyrinth of complex scientific terminology and interrelationships in 
class. Few could follow him and still come out the other side; I know I 
couldn't. But I could understand enough to know that Michael espoused a vision 
of holistic interconnectedness expressed in scientific terminology that 
completely jived with my traditional Chinese and Ayurvedic models. &nbsp;It may 
have been tough for us to hang on to Michael's train of thought in a workshop 
or classroom situation, but this never diminished one iota my deep respect for 
him, whom I consider another one of those misunderstood geniuses.</p> 
<p>For a while I wanted to engage Michael in a discussion comparing Chinese 
and Ayurvedic energetic herbal medicine with what I mostly suspected was 
Michael's version of the same in Western biochemistry and physiology. Knowing 
this, he approached me with his intention to formulate a constitutional model 
of the human body based on Western physiology. We co-taught one class together 
on this. In the end, I'm not sure either of us nor any of the participants got 
anything from the experiment, but it is worth knowing that we tried and that 
this is now increasingly becoming a powerful direction in which to carry 
Planetary Herbology in the future.</p> 
<p>I do know that despite his gruff appearance, <strong>Michael was a true 
gentleman.</strong> He was always too cognizant of his own personal 
shortcomings to hold anything against others he would encounter.&nbsp; I think 
the concept of the personal<em>hamartia</em> (the tragic flaw that ultimately 
brings down the hero that the audience perceives but the hero does not) didn't 
apply to Michael, whose self-awareness made him the kind of teacher and healer 
who would have to say in so many words, &quot;Do as I say but not as I 
do.&quot;&nbsp; All of us have our personal limitations that we must struggle 
with through life. In Michael's case these do not in the slightest tarnish the 
contribution he has made to herbalism now and as far as it will extend into the 
future.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Dioscorides, the famous Greek physician who served as a field doctor to 
Roman legions during the reign of Nero, discovered and chronicled the medical 
use of over 600 plants found throughout different regions of the known Western 
world. His herbal served as the most indispensible one of its kind for over 
1,500 years through the Middle Ages. In a similar way, Michael Moore's three 
books on the medicinal uses of herbs west of the Rocky Mountains will remain as 
the quintessential source reference for this area for many years to come.</p> 
<p>But back to the burly, bearded, avant-garde musician-herbalist at the fair. 
<br> <br>
 I have noticed that for the most part, herbalists in all cultures 
are also artists, musicians or poets. There is an appreciation for aesthetics 
and things beautiful and creative that I think underlies one's attraction to 
the use of plants as medicine.&nbsp; As Michael says, &quot;There are no fixed 
methods to apply to the human predicament, there is no single all-pervasive 
rule to follow, since medicine is not a science but an art.&quot;</p> 
<p>No matter how deeply one studies and enters into the complexity of healing, 
plant biochemistry and so on (and I happen to agree with Michael that one<em>
should</em> go deeply into these things), nevertheless there is always place 
for the irrational and the subjective.<strong>The poet's perspective of life, 
the musician's sense of harmony, the artist's eye of proportion and 
relationships - these are all shared by healers, especially the herbal healer 
who works with plants, which are the pure creative expression of nature and the 
healing process.</strong></p> 
<p>Michael was an extraordinary musician. Music is something that he and I 
shared in a special way. I was honored when at a symposium he presented me with 
a gift of two CDs which were the recordings of his beautiful orchestral works. 
&nbsp;After I learned of his passing, I went to find these CDs and play them in 
his honor. For whatever reason, they would not play. I was so happy to see that
these recordings, along with his teaching manuals, scans of valuable medical 
Eclectic books, and other precious herb-related materials, are all freely 
available to enjoy online.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
 We are so blessed to have this kind 
of access to Michael's herbal and artistic treasures, which he always so 
graciously shared.<strong> Personally I think this says volumes about the kind 
of man Michael Moore was:</strong> at the core of his being, he was a man of 
genius, deep caring and generosity.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p><strong><em>Note:</em></strong><em> Michael&rsquo;s generosity does not 
leave a whole lot to pay for his enormous medical bills and support his beloved 
wife, Donna.<strong>It is important that we give back some of what we received 
from the life work of Michael Moore and all that he has done for the herbal 
renaissance of North America. Donations can be made out toThe Bountiful Alliance
 and sent to:</strong> Catherine Mackenzie, 457 East Riverside Dr., Truth or 
Consequences, NM, 87901. The Bountiful Alliance is a 501 C-3 non-profit 
organization&nbsp;and&nbsp;is able to&nbsp;issue receipts for tax purposes.</em>

</em><strong><em>Please consider attending</em></strong><strong>
<em> this April 17-19, 2009, event</em></strong><strong><em> in Truth or 
Consequences, NM.</em></strong><em> Originally coordinated to help raise funds 
for Michael's medical expenses, now it will be not only a fine educational 
event but also a celebration of this great herbalist's life and legacy.</em></p>

<p>---------------<br>
 &nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>To: President-Elect Barack H. Obama</strong></p> 
<p><strong>Presidential Petition for Incorporation of Integrative CAM into 
U.S. Health Care Policy</strong></p> 
<h2>&nbsp;</h2> 
<p>Dear President-Elect Barack Obama,</p> 
<p>I respectfully ask that you incorporate Integrative Medicine modalities 
into any new U.S. health care policy once you take office in January 2009.</p> 
<p>The 1979 oft cited resolution by the World Health Organization[i] called on 
countries to promote the role of traditional practitioners in the health care 
systems of the world and also encouraged more financial support for the 
development of traditional systems.</p> 
<p>It further recommended that the medical profession should not undervalue 
the role played by the traditional medical system in providing important health 
care in developing countries and even specifically advocated the use of 
medicinal plants and remedies used by traditional practitioners to effectively 
treat their patients.</p> 
<p>With the popularity of these traditional healing systems, we are at the 
place in time where at least a third of the people of America have recognized 
the value of these traditional systems not only for developing countries but as 
being of great benefit for certain conditions in our own country.</p> 
<p>Because they provide relatively safe and effective approaches for treating 
many conditions, evidence-based, complementary, alternative medicine (CAM) 
health care modalities should be integrated into the U.S. health care system.
</p> 
<p>There are many reasons why one would choose such alternative health care 
methods but one of the most obvious is described in published research 
revealing that over 150,000 Americans die annually from FDA-approved 
pharmaceuticals that have been prescribed and utilized according to their 
indications. Shockingly, these 'iatrogenic' (medically induced) deaths account 
for the fifth major cause of mortality in the U.S.</p> 
<p>I am one of the millions of Americans who have found complementary, natural 
health methods to be an invaluable part of my health care requirements and 
needs. These systems, including acupuncture, herbal medicine, naturopathy, 
chiropractic, homeopathy and Traditional Chinese and Ayurvedic medicine offer 
aspects of health care that are not provided by conventional Western medicine.
</p> 
<p>A recent study based on 1162 patients found acupuncture to be more 
effective for treating lower back pain, from which 85% of all people will 
suffer at some point in their life, than conventional treatments.[ii] This is 
only one of many conditions that are better treated with traditional 
alternative medicine but the fact remains that these time honored methods 
represent relatively non-invasive treatments that continues to be the legacy of 
all traditional peoples throughout the world.</p> 
<p>The reasons that these methods continue to be resorted to is because 
conventional Western medicine based on expensive technological procedures and 
synthetic drugs, for various reasons is not always the best approach for all 
conditions, in much the same ways that exclusive reliance on fossil fuels is 
unsatisfactory for all of our energy needs.</p> 
<p>Happily, there are other approaches from which to choose and utilize. These 
are some of the reasons why Harvard studies conducted by David Eisenberg, M.D. 
et al.,[iii] in 1990 and again in 1997 revealed that a significantly large 
percentage of Americans are already using these integrate, alternative, 
complementary therapeutic approaches and that they are even willing to spend 
more out-of-pocket money for such care than for all allopathic primary care and 
hospital care combined.</p> 
<p>As recent as December, 2008, a National Health Statistics Report, entitled 
Complementary and Alternative Health (CAM) Care Use Among Children and Adults: 
United States 2007 by Barnes' et al. revealed that 38% of adults and 12% of 
children used CAM therapies over the previous 12 months.[iv]</p> 
<p>I stand ready to be of assistance to you and Secretary of Health, Tom 
Daschle in any way that I can. Thank you for your kind attention and I look 
forward to your expedient response.</p> 
<p>Yours Truly,</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
