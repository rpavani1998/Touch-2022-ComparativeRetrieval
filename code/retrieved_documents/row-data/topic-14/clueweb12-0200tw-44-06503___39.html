Acupuncture could be damping down pain through a natural painkiller called 
adenosine. Photograph: Jon Feingersh/Getty Images<br>

<p>Scientists have performed acupuncture on mice with sore paws to pinpoint 
how the ancient Chinese medical practice might alleviate pain in humans.</p> 
<p>After a half-hour session, the mice felt less discomfort in their paws 
because the needles triggered the release of a natural painkiller, say the 
researchers. The needles stimulated cells to produce adenosine, an 
anti-inflammatory and painkilling chemical, that was effective for up to an 
hour after the therapy was over.</p> 
<p>The discovery challenges a widely held view among scientists that any 
benefit patients feel after having acupuncture is purely due to theplacebo 
effect.</p> 
<p>&quot;The view that acupuncture does not have much benefit beyond the 
placebo effect has really hampered research into the technique,&quot; said
Maiken Nedergaard, a neuroscientist at the University of Rochester Medical 
Centre in New York, who led the study.</p> 
<p>&quot;Some people think any work in this area is junk research, but I think 
that's wrong. I was really surprised at the arrogance of some of my colleagues. 
We can benefit from what has been learned over many thousands of years,&quot; 
Nedergaard told the Guardian.</p> 
<p>Acupuncture was developed in China around 4,000 years ago. The procedure 
involves inserting fine needles at specific points around the body and then 
heating, twisting or even electrifying them.</p> 
<p>Traditional practitioners claim acupuncture works by improving the flow of 
&quot;qi energy&quot; along &quot;meridians&quot;, butthe latest research, 
published in Nature Neuroscience, points to a less mystical explanation.</p> 
<p>&quot;I believe we've found the main mechanism by which acupuncture 
relieves pain. Adenosine is a very potent anti-inflammatory compound and most 
chronic pain is caused by inflammation,&quot; Nedergaard said.</p> 
<p>The scientists gave each mouse a sore paw by injecting it with an 
inflammatory chemical. Half of the mice lacked a gene that is needed to make 
adenosine receptors, which are dotted along major nerves.</p> 
<p>The therapy session involved inserting a fine needle into an acupuncture 
point in the knee above the sore foot. In keeping with traditional practice, 
the needles were rotated periodically throughout the half-hour session.</p> 
<p>To measure how effective the acupuncture was, the researchers recorded how 
quickly each mouse pulled its sore paw away from a small bristly brush. The 
more pain the mice were in, the faster they pulled away.</p> 
<p>Writing in the journal, Nedergaard's team describe how acupuncture reduced 
pain by two thirds in normal mice, but had no effect on the discomfort of mice 
that lacked the adenosine receptor gene. Without adenosine receptors, the 
chemical will have no effect on the mice when it is released in their bodies.
</p> 
<p>The acupunture had no effect at all in either group if the needles were not 
rotated.</p> 
<p>Nedergaard said that twisting the needles seems to cause enough damage to 
make cells release adenosine. The chemical is then picked up by adenosine 
receptors on nearby nerves, which react by damping down pain. Further tests on 
the mice revealed that levels of adenosine surged 24-fold in the tissues around 
the acupuncture needles during and immediately after each session.</p> 
<p>One of the long-standing mysteries surrounding acupuncture is why the 
technique only seems to alleviate pain if needles are inserted at specific 
points. Nedergaard believes that most of these points are along major nerve 
tracks, and as such are parts of the body that have plenty of adenosine 
receptors.</p> 
<p>In a final experiment, Nedergaard's team injected mice with a cancer drug 
that made it harder to remove adenosine from their tissues. The drug, called
deoxycoformycin, boosted the effects of acupuncture dramatically, more than 
tripling how long the pain relief lasted.</p> 
<p>&quot;There is an attitude among some researchers that studying alternative 
medicine is unfashionable,&quot; said Nedergaard. &quot;Because it has not been 
understood completely, many people have remained sceptical.&quot;</p> 
<p>Although the study explains how acupuncture can alleviate pain, it sheds no 
light on any of the other health benefits that some practitioners believe it 
can achieve.</p>

<p>most of the pseudo science alternative therapy cranks are also against 
animal testing but -<b>Acupuncture: tested by sticking needles into mice!</b>

<p>Would it not be better to work on a drug based on adenosine or cheaper 
versions of the cancer drug which boosts its effect... better still a drug 
which increases natural release.</p> 
<p>Interesting stuff... but a peer review is much needed </p> 
<p>Will Trepanning give similar results ? ... (I don't want to be a guinea pig 
for that one though)</p> </li>

<p>'Western' medicine is not the pinnacle as many sceptics believe. I can give 
you an example of the real benefits acupuncture can have. My knee was not 
bending in the correct manner due to my m. vastus medialis (the muscle of the 
inner thigh) being inoperable due to a spasm previously. In effect, the muscle 
had atrophied and had stopped working. One needle inserted into a specific 
place on that muscle sent what can only be described as an electric shock 
through it, and with exercise for a few days to prevent re-spasming, my knee is 
functioning normally. Acupunture is a safe and very effective way to treat many 
problems, especially those to do with muscular function. Blind quasi-religious 
belief that 'western' medicine is the only sensible option to treat medical 
ailments is both ignorant and dangerous. An holistic approach is far more 
sensible and offers freedom to choose the right treatment for a certain problem.

<p>I think you will find it is called the scientific method. Which is the 
reason for tremendous advances in technology over the previous 400 years or so. 
Including medical advances such as numerous vaccines, the elimination of 
smallpox, women being much less likely to die in childbirth, organ donation, 
blood transfusion, anti-biotics etc.</p> 
<p>You can have your healing crystal massages and I'll take all of the above.

<p>Nobody suggested that western medicine (you know, the real science is not 
good) is backward or bad, every single treatment should eventually be able to 
have a scientific explanation, but it doesn't mean that we should reject 
acupuncture totally.</p> 
<p>Heart attack? western medicine (surgery) works magic. (but just for 
reference, Chinese traditional medicine is not just about needles and herbs, 
the Chinese has developed open-skull surgery and anethestics thousands of years 
ago)</p> 
<p>hormonal issue (e.g. period problem)? Herbal or acupuncture is a very good 
and non-invasive way of treatment.</p> 
<p>infectious disease? Thumbs up for the western medicine </p> 
<p>back pain? acupuncture is proven to be effective </p> 
<p>The central theme of Chinese medicine is to try to find a natural way of 
healing disease, like researching the various healing potentials of herbs and 
even daily fruit and vegetables, whereas western medicine is taking a 
completely different approach which aims to acheive instant result through 
invasive or synthetic method.</p> 
<p>Therefore, the target diseases/physical problems for both system of 
treatment are different, they could overlap at times, but do not contradict, 
that's why acupuncture is classified as alternative/complementary treatment, 
not 'ANTI-WESTERN MEDICINE TREATMENT&quot;.</p> 
<p>Please, do stop being ignorant and narrow-minded, a medical system that has 
been the sole healing system in practice for billions of people for thousands 
of years just could NOT possibly be TOTAL RUBBISH.</p> 
<p>Scientific explanation is important, but discarding a method which clearly 
worked (on a large scale) just because no scientific explanation is yet found, 
you would be missing out a lot.</p> </li>

<p>Chinese herbs and acupuncture cured my ailments and those of other people I 
know. What I found encouraging was that the Chinese doctor was not only 
knowledgeable in his own field but was also trained in 'western medicine'. He 
admitted that for some things western medicine would be more beneficial.</p> 
<p>In my case the acupuncture was an added 'boost' to the herbs which, over 
time, did the trick. I would recommend anyone to try it, particularly for 
problems with hayfever, excema, thyroid, muscular or hormonal problems.</p> 
<p>Chinese medicine has been around for 2,000 years. That has given it plenty 
of time to be either fine-tuned, or revealed as mumbo-jumbo.</p> </li>

<p>I remain hugely skeptical. I remember some time ago a study showing that 
acupuncture was a placebo.</p> 
<p>Chinese medicine, for me, IS mainly mumbo jumbo - sorry @thestrangeones. 
</p> 
<p>Western medicine has changed the world since the use of cowpox to treat 
small pox and Jenner treating it in this way.</p> 
<p>I am watching a program right now on C4 about the 5 great British 
scientists of the C17 - Newton, Hooke, Wren etc - great stuff. It just 
underlines how far Western civilization has come in 400 years, and really how 
stuck non experimental and non-observational medicine remains.</p> </li>

after 30+ of suffering from it. it changed it from being chronic to mildly 
irritating and has greatly improved my life quality.</p> 
<p>I am no scientist and have no vested interest, i only went for the 
treatment in desparation because the 'conventional' drugs really didnt work.</p>

<p>Glenji, Why does it have to be an either/or situation ? I subscribe to 
orthodox medicines but also to complementary techniques. Acupuncture has 
relieved my bronchial/asthma considerably and has given me a new lease of life. 
I also use prescribed inhalers.</p> </li>

<p>Does it? I'll take a painkiller thanks. The thought of some 'trained 
professional' jabbing needles into my back has never really appealed to me.<br>

&quot;</p> 
<p>--thetowncrier </p> 
<p>But the thought of getting your liver, kidneys, stomach lining, damaged by 
painkillers such as aspirin, acetaminophen, ibuprofen etc, appeals to you. 
Also, I guess heart issues appeal to you.</p> </li>

<p>Proof of the effectivness of acupuncture on animals will not come as any 
surprise to clients of the several vets who have added acupuncture to their 
range of treatments.</p> 
<p>Jill Adair at Handcross did some studies of traditional Chinese acupuncture 
treatment of large draught animals and translated it into small animal terms. 
It proved to be effective on our old and much loved rheumaticy dog.</p>

<p>the question is not so much whether acupuncture, homeopathy, 
magnetotherapy, mesmer's electric bucket achieve their means thru placebo or by 
an actual physiological effect... but more: will health insurance providers 
accept their rationale as sufficiently legitimate to cover their costs.</p> 
<p>acupuncture is labour and time intensive. i took three weekly sessions for 
three years after a very nasty HIV primary infection. it took a lot of time, 
waiting for my turn, getting the needles and chatting with the doctor about 
regimen and mental health. it was also not covered by the national health plan. 
and i was a student</p> 
<p>fortunately my physician (a consultant oncologist) was a kind and generous 
man and waived most of his fees. this was 20 years ago. today, i take 
antiretroviral drugs to excellent results. sometimes i wonder if the 
acupuncture treament, which i took instead of antiretroviral treatment that in 
the early 90's was a living hell, didn't prepare the terrain for a smooth 
antiretroviral treatment in the following years.</p> </li>

<p>&quot;most of the pseudo science alternative therapy cranks are also 
against animal testing but - Acupuncture: tested by sticking needles into mice! 
&quot;</p> 
<p>That is extremely weak. And you know it. </p> 
<p>&quot;receptors.&quot;....except that this study 
http://www.docbug.com/blog/archives/000353.html showed that random acupuncture 
works as well as formal acupuncture as a pain killer- in other words it doesnt 
work any better if the needles are just stuck in anywhere so bang goes the 
adenosine receptor theory&quot;</p> 
<p>Your link doesn't say &quot;random&quot;. It says &quot;:sham&quot; points. 
Which could mean random. Or not. If you are prescribed sugar pills, it is

<p>Agathe, </p> 
<p>My big problem with complimentary medicine is that it spouts a load of 
rubbish and a lot of very vulnerable people fall for it. Often at great cost to 
their finances and their health.</p> 
<p>The fact that the placebo effect is so powerful and that the human mind is 
hard wired to detect causality when none exists, means that these charlatans 
can continue fleecing people.</p> 
<p>In the majority of cases this is harmless. If someone wants to spend their 
own money buying sugar pills in the mistaken belief that homeopathy works then 
fine. If they are self treating hayfever then no one is going to get hurt. But 
this opens the possibility that people will abandon genuinely efficacious, 
double blind tested courses of treatment for more serious ailments in favour of 
quack treatments.</p> 
<p>Although I think my biggest problem with it is just simply the fact that it 
is all bollocks. Chi, karma, ghosts, ghoulies, crystal energy, water memory, 
chakra alignment and all the rest of it.</p> 
<p>It sullies our intellectual discourse to give the time of day to any of 
these ideas.</p> 
<p>There is a million dollar prize available to anyone who can prove any of it.

<p>I had acupuncture for back pain. Whilst it only cured the back pain 
temporarily a side effect was that it completely cured the RSI in my forearms, 
which I hadn't even told the practitioner about.</p> 
<p>I had pins in the soft tissue between the thumb and index finger and when 
the pins were twiddled I felt such a surge of something through my body, much 
like an electric shock, that my whole body jolted up off the table. A very 
strange experience.</p> </li>

<p>It makes me laugh that so many of you folk who rubbish Chinese medicine and 
other mumbo jumbo feel so hurt and offended on behalf of those who have used 
these things.<br>
No one is forcing you to try accupuncture, herbs, 
aromatherapy or whatever. Why get so hot under the collar?<br>
I didn't have 
any success with homeopathy but it didn't bring me out in a rash, make me 
vomit, erode my stomach lining, crumble my bones, give me hot flushes, impair 
my memory, make my heart race, give me nightmares or make me halluninate.<br>

These are all side effects that I've suffered from Western medicines.</p> </li>

<p>The critics must really stop lumping all &quot;complementary 
medicines&quot; together. Some of the comments here seem to say 'we know 
acupuncture doesn't work because we are sure homeopathay doesn't work'. Chinese 
medicine has nothing whatsoever to do with homeopathy. It's like defining all 
sports as &quot;not rugby&quot; and then saying that football is dangerous 
because mountaineering is, and they're both not rubgy, and therefore 
footballers may suffer injuries falling several thousand feet.</p> 
<p>It's not very scientific. </p> 
<p>&quot;So here is some interesting evidence, let's have a look&quot; is 
surely the scientific response. Even if it can't (yet) be explained, if this 
study does what it says, there is some evidence and it's early days.</p> 
<p>PS I don't think the 'pro-complementary medicine crowd&quot; necessarily 
called for experiments on animals. Seems a bit unnecessary when so many people 
are choosing to have acupuncture.</p> </li>

<p>This isn't about 'Western medicine' v 'Eastern medicine', but about 
'medicine' v 'crap that doesn't work'. And in humans, the better-designed a 
clinical trial of acupuncture is, the weaker the effect. And when we get to the 
proper placebo-controlled double-blinded trials, there's zero effect above 
placebo.</p> 
<p>Of course, the acupuncture industry isn't going to let go that easily, and 
interprets such results with truculence: &quot;See,&quot; they cry, 
&quot;acupuncture is so great that even<i>placebo</i> acupuncture works! Now 
bend over while I arbitrarily poke your arse with needles. That'll be

<p>&quot; The human frame, when once it has felt the influence of genuine 
cowpox, is never afterwards, at any period of its existence, assailable by 
smallpox.&quot;<br>
- Jenner </p> 
<p>Poor Jenner, he was like an acupuncturist who claims to cure smoking in all 
patients, seemingly untroubled that many of his patients carry on smoking after 
treatment.</p> 
<p>Eventually, Jenner faced facts for he could no longer credibly claim 
otherwise:<b>&quot;Cases of smallpox after inoculation are innumerable.&quot;
</b> </p> 
<p>William White: <br>
&quot; The vaccinated caught smallpox; they fell sick 
after the operation; they were afflicted with eruptions and swellings; they 
died. These mishaps were at first denied?stoutly denied; and when denial was no 
longer possible, it was attempted to explain them away. The cowpox used could 
not have been genuine cowpox, but spurious; and for awhile spurious cowpox did 
yeoman's service in the way of apology; but by-and-by the excuse began to work 
more harm than good. Mishaps were so numerous that people became afraid of this 
omnipresent spurious cowpox, and to ask what it was, and how it could be 
avoided. How can there be spurious pox ? Whoever heard of spurious disease ? 
Milkmen vend spurious milk, grocers spurious sugar, smashers spurious coin; but 
surely cows are not to be numbered with such malefactors as producers of 
spurious pox! The thing was absurd on its face, and absurd it proved. When 
Jenner was under examination by a committee of the College of Physicians in 
1806, he was pressed hard for a definition of spurious cowpox, when he 
&quot;owned up.&quot; He knew nothing of spurious cowpox. The words had been 
employed, not to describe any irregularity on the part of the cow, but certain 
irregularities in the action of cowpox on the part of the vaccinated : which 
was to say that when the vaccinated recovered creditably and did not catch 
smallpox, the cowpox was genuine; but when the sequences were otherwise, why 
then it was spurious! Ingenious and convenient, was it not ?&quot;</p> </li>

<p>Nice to see an article that displays an almost open mind to a medical 
tradition that is outside the NHS. Acupuncture works on the meridians an energy 
network that will baffle and annoy the flat earth western medical fraternity - 
Acupuncture and TCM have been practiced for thousands of years and they are 
massively popular in asia because they work. Peer review etc is great but 
western medicine has a rough history of horrors from Thalidomide to shock 
treatment - our medical approach is totally different and has caused massive 
amounts of harm - scientific thought 100 years ago seems horrific and 
ridiculous now where as Chinese medicine has a much longer and deeper history 
and does not use such invasive techniques - it is also based on the study of 
living healthy humans with the goal being to maintain that healthy state rather 
than being based on the study of cadavers and focused on the already sick. I 
had severe Psoriasis and after years of steroid creams which never helped I was 
able to cure it through a combination of Herbal medicine and acupuncture both 
based on ancient prescriptions rather than topically suppressing the herbs 
acted on the cause and improved my digestion and general health and left me 
glowing with health and for the first time clear skin. One of the major issues 
with western medicine is that is totally profit driven - the ideal product for 
a drug company is one which will suppress symptoms while you use the product 
only to have them come back in full once you stop this creates a life long 
customer - a product that actually solved the problem would be bad as it would 
limit the potential sales.<br>
Just because science is unable to understand or 
quantify something does not mean its rubbish - physics could not explain how a 
bumble bee could fly until recently but that does not mean they never flew.<br>

The world is still full with so many amazing things that we cannot comprehend 
and its worthwhile being open minded - open minded people are the ones who have 
created progress on earth and those who blindly adhere to orthodox opinions are 
the ones who killed Galileo etc Science is so important and valid but its worth 
remembering that todays scientific theories often seem ridiculous in 100 years 
time. Its great that one simple facet of Acupuncture has been understood I look 
forward to a time when science can start to measure subtle energies in the body 
and our understanding of the complexity of humanity gets much deeper than its 
current simplistic and shallow view.</p> </li>

<p>Jane4444 - of course you won't get side effects from homeopathy. Well, 
unless you're allergic to sugar pills or water.</p> 
<p>Personally I don't consider Chinese medicine especially 
&quot;alternative&quot;. Taking some form of drug, be it synthesized or 
naturally occurring, or some form of physical therapy seems to me to be able to 
affect my physiological state. I'd also make sure that multiple medications 
shouldn't be conflicting, so ensuring anyone administering you knows what else 
you're being treated for.</p> 
<p>I also consider your spiritual and psychological well-being to be vital to 
your health. And for that I accept and embrace a whole bunch of things that do 
not need to show their proof, since it's just about feeling better. It is also 
highly individual, so there is no right answer for everyone, just a right 
answer for an individual.</p> 
<p>I would consider a lot of the truly &quot;alternative&quot; therapies in 
the second category, along with things like counseling, religion, team sports 
and recreation drug use. It takes all sorts, but it really boils down to having 
some human contact, and a belief in something greater than oneself, so it's all 
OK. People need comfort and love, the world can be a sucky place. You can also 
lump the placebo effect in here too, since you can put that down somewhat to 
wanting to be better.</p> 
<p>My favorite experiment for the placebo is the double blind ulcer trial, 
where half the group is given 2 sugar tablets, and the other half are given 4. 
The stated trial is supposed to be about dosage over time and delivery method, 
hence the testers believe they are testing active drugs. The results where that 
the groups taking more sugar tablets had a greator reduction in ulcer size, and 
over all the subjects there was a reduction in ulcer size.</p> 
<p>As for my personal experiences, caring about what I eat, and doing 
something that moves me around tend to sort out most of my ills. Painkillers 
are great for acute pain, but terrible for long term pain for me. I have a bad 
back and damaged wrist, and the only thing that helps in the end is stretching 
and exercise. Pilate and toga for the back, assorted rubber bands and balls for 
the wrist. It hurts for a while, then it hurts a bit less as whatever natural 
painkilling system kicks in. Going for a gentle walk for half an hour when I'm 
down cheers me up more than any anti-depressant.</p> </li>

<p><i>Would it not be better to work on a drug based on adenosine or cheaper 
versions of the cancer drug which boosts its effect.</i> </p> 
<p>I would rather have a none invasive technique solve the problem than take a 
drug which invades the whole body, e.g. the acupuncture I have about every 12 
months eliminates the back pain (I have 3 lower back ruptured disks), or I can 
take 400 mg of ibuprofen every day for the same effect.</p> 
<p>As a practical matter, I don't really care if acupuncture is a placebo (I 
don't think it is). It avoids me taking a pain killer almost every day, which 
over time will not be good for the rest of my body.</p> </li>

<p>I have a sense that a lot of the naysayers have never had acupuncture. If 
they had they would know that the 'needle' used is not really a needle, but a 
thread of steel, so fine that it is absolutely painless when inserted. The most 
one feels, depending upon sensitivity, can be tingling... like electrical 
currents... but a lot of people feel nothing.</p> 
<p>Everyone is different and acupuncture is more successful for some than 
others but there is no doubt that it works.</p> </li>

<p>Even as an extreme sceptic, I wasn't aware that many scientists considered 
acupuncture to have no physiological effect. Of course sticking pins in the 
body is going to have an effect!<br>
What people are sceptical of is that you 
have to stick them in your toes to cure a headache, or any other combination of 
unrelated parts of the body.</p> 
<p>Choosing the knee to stop foot pain makes sense because the knee is between 
the source of the pain and its destination (the brain). Choosing the knee to 
stop pain in a finger only makes sense if the painkilling effect is spread 
throughout the body - which it could be. But then you could just as easily 
choose anywhere else, as the previous study proved (notwithstanding the 
mumbo-jumbo about qi and magic meridians connecting your middle toe with your 
tonsils or whatever).</p> 
<p>Scientists and sceptics alike have no problem with the possibility that 
acupuncture has a painkilling effect, so this study doesn't contradict them. 
What it doesn't do is show that any of the numerous claims about acupuncture 
curing disease or other conditions (except as a placebo) has any basis in fact.

<p>Caress of steel, <br>
One of the interesting things about diseases is how 
they appear in cycles, or waves. Tuberculosis for instance, was diminishing 
substantially before the introduction of vaccination. So the question is: was 
it the vaccination or was it disappearing naturally... or was it a bit of both?

<p>I was incredibly dubious when my wife wanted to get our 12 year old 
arthritic golden retriever dog to get acupuncture, but she has undoubtedly had 
positive effects. She can now get up the stairs, whereas before she could 
hardly stand. Non of the drugs worked for her at all, and we have tried many of 
them.</p> 
<p>Judging by the waiting list to get in to see this particular vet, my dog 
isn't the only one to see a real and tangible benefit.</p> 
<p>Is there any science on dogs benefiting from a placebo effect? Thought not. 
</p> 
<p>I am a full believer in good science, but when it comes to some of the more 
'out there' things that could be tested, it seems a lot of scientists would 
rather shout 'impossible' than get on and actually do any real science on the 
matter. Which seems rather unscientific to me.</p> </li>

<p>It would be interesting to know how many of those opposed to acupuncture 
have ever experienced the process? It's one thing to reject something when you 
actually know what you are talking about but quite another to reject it out of 
prejudice and ignorance.</p> </li>

<p>Having been urged by a specialist who could not find any answer to a life 
threatening breathing problem to go and try anything that I thought might help, 
that he would provide any support needed in any alternative treatment that I 
undertook, and, most of all, to get back and tell him if anything worked, I 
eventually found my way to acupuncture.</p> 
<p>It is a factual statement that they kept me alive for some years. 
Eventually, by chance we discovered the cause, and highly sophisticated western 
medicine corrected the problem. Years of living an hour by hour essence had 
left residual scars, and a fragile health.</p> 
<p>Acupuncture, and the more expansive Chinese Medicine kept me going, and 
built my life quality. Alternative western based medicine boosted my health to 
unexpectedly high levels, and subsequently, years later acupuncture and herbs 
bought me to a level of ?normal good health?.</p> 
<p>That journey began nigh on 40 years ago. A few points. </p> 
<p>All of the three acupuncturists that I have used have been quick to refer a 
patient to a western trained doctor for issues that they can better address.</p>
<p>Needles are not twisted on a regular basis. On rare occasion, yes. 
Electricity is applied in some circumstances, but rarely.</p> 
<p>To suggest that the needles can be ?stuck in anywhere? is breathtakingly 
ignorant! As is the suggestion that acupuncture is a ?painkiller?!</p> 
<p>Traditional medicine looks at, and works to balance (treat) the total 
person. Western medicine, generally, looks to fix a specific problem. Terrific 
if you have a broken bone or a burst appendix!</p> </li>

<p>Western banking system, western democracy, western family values, western 
medicine etc etc..... i get the picture, west is best, always bet on the west, 
esp. if your money is sitting in a bank needed for your medical treatment :-)
</p> 
<p>For 6 years I have not had much of a feeling in my right small finger, it 
would go numb sometimes, and down my right side lower arm too. It was probably 
a pinched/trapped nerve i had about that time that didn't fully go away. All 
x-rays and massage and drugs to alleviate the pain hasn't worked. Well its not 
really pain, just a it annoying, i can live with it but not sure what it might 
develop to when i'm older.</p> 
<p>Tried acupuncture for one session and bingo - I could feel my little finger 
again!! It was amazing. Only 2nd in amazement after being able to see properly 
with no glasses after laser eye surgery. I didnt believe it would work, i 
didn't believe in all this chinese mumbo jumbo my friends were telling me here 
in asia with praying at temples and worshipping the dead and needles in certain 
areas of my neck and back - i always believed x-rays and medicine or surgery 
would get rid off anything wrong with me.....did it hell.</p> 
<p>But last week i had toothache - western equipment and medicine helped to 
alleviate that and acupuncture probably cannot. So there's a place for all 
types of medicine in this world, we don't just have to rely on a prescription 
sheet with unreadable writing on it.</p> </li>

<p>&quot;Yes, nishville, it's the method that re-appraises its views in the 
light of new evidence, as opposed to the &quot;we don't need any of that silly 
peer-reviewed, evidence-based, double-blind testing nonsense&quot;.' (Wishfort)
</p> 
<p>Western science doesn't reapprise anything which isn't in its own 
framework, Wishfort. It is an activity that relies on values measurable by its 
own standards which works magically in short term, but is disasterous in long 
one, as it is painfully obvious these days.</p> 
<p>Science erradicated polio, small pox etc? Nothing could be further from the 
thruth. Western medical science never works on the causes and prevention, it 
concentrates itself exclusively on symptoms. Therefore, all those diseases are 
not eradicated, they are just suppressed - mutating and waiting for a future 
generation of humans to wipe out.</p> 
<p>New and stronger diseases, radioactive waste, climate changes, WMD 
,microwave polution, toxic oceans - the facade of the brave new world of 
western science starts to crumble and what appears behind it is death, poverty 
and large corporations responsible to nobody.</p> 
<p>Western science is bankrupt and if it doesn't find its heart soon, we're 
all up the proverbial creek without the manoeuvring equipment.</p> </li>

<p>I'm not medically trained so I don't consider myself qualified to comment 
on the merits of acupuncture (unlike a lot of the posters above). But I do know 
a highly qualified doctor and extremely medical establishment who is trained 
in, and practices acupuncture.</p> 
<p>Homeopathy may be nonsense but that doesn't mean that every non-Western 
treatment is. Uncritical rejection of &quot;alternative&quot; medicine is just 
as stupid as uncritical acceptance.</p> 
<p>Talking of which, I can recommend yoga for carpal tunnel syndrome: </p>

<p>Oh dear can we please have a sub editor with a science degree? Or do you 
think that the placebo effect is something magic and so it cannot have a 
mechanism, like, oh let me think: exactly this.</p> 
<p>I am a distance runner and my body makes endorphins at the drop of a hat. 
Between two identical operations I got myself fit and needed no post op 
analgesics and took nothing for pain for 2 weeks post op. That is how powerful 
your own systems can be.</p> 
<p>This does not mean acupuncture 'works' better than placebo and the study 
doesn't show this. Study after study after meta analysis have shown the 
acupuncture is no better, or worse, than a placebo. This study will only 
convince people who think the placebo effect is small or insignificant, it 
isn't.</p> 
<p>It is almost as though Ben Goldacre never existed. Please, can anyone 
associated with stories like this be made to read all his columns? He has 
written extensively on how powerful the placebo effect is.</p> </li>
