<p><strong>What should I expect during my first acupuncture treatment? 
</strong></p> 
<p>Acupuncture is an ancient Oriental healing system that stimulates the 
body's ability to balance its &ldquo;qi&rdquo; and heal itself by the insertion 
of thin, sterile needles at specific points along the body's meridian system. 
Qi is the life force that flows along the meridians between these points, which 
are located within cell groups that have been shown to have especially 
permeable cell membranes. In biomedical terms, this means that chemical 
messages (qi) travel faster through those cells. Good health results when qi 
flows freely along the meridians; disease develops where qi is deficient or 
blocked.</p> 
<p>An acupuncturist will form a diagnosis by taking a health history, 
including asking why you are there, looking at your tongue, taking your six 
pulses, and maybe pressing on your abdomen. After that she will swab with 
alcohol the spots where she&rsquo;s going to insert the sterile, disposable 
needles and insert them. Then depending on what method she practices and the 
disorder being treated, she will either leave the needles in or not; manipulate 
the needles, or not, burn moxa (a healing herb) or not, leave the room or not. 
The depth of the insertion and how long the needles are left in place, if at 
all, depends on the method of acupuncture being used. Sometimes the process is 
repeated with the patient laying on the stomach, sometimes not. The same is 
true for adding any adjunct natural healing modalities of acupuncture such as 
cupping,<em>gwa sha</em>, herbal teas, nutritional supplements, bodywork, 
healing touch, moxa, etc. Some practitioners use them, some do not.</p> 
<p>One of the reasons acupuncturists vary so greatly in how they practice is 
because Asia is big. China, Japan and Korea all have their own distinct methods 
and it is very common to find variations within those methods based on 
who&rsquo;s teaching it. Add to that the fact that the practice of acupuncture 
is at least 2,000 years old, and you get even more variation. Some schools, and 
thus some practitioners, will encompass more or fewer biomedical 
ideas/techniques, and more or fewer adjunct modalities.</p> 
<p>There are, however, some similarities between forms of acupuncture. All 
insert needles and all attempt to summon qi. It is the needling techniques that 
distinguish the skill of one practitioner from another: how a practitioner 
obtains qi, whether he can or cannot do so, whether he or the patient senses 
the qi, what the practitioner does with the qi. An acupuncturist senses the qi 
coming to the needle as a tug on the needle. Some acupuncturists twirl 
(manipulate) the needle until they feel the qi sensation, others simply leave 
the needles in place until the qi, in its normal cycle through the meridians, 
comes to the needle. Some people can actually feel a mild sensation traveling 
along the course of the meridian when a needle is inserted. Not everyone feels 
it, and everyone doesn&rsquo;t have to, but the qi must travel if the treatment 
is to be effective.</p> 
<p>The length of time needles are retained varies between practitioners. It 
can be from between 20 minutes to an hour. During that time many acupuncturists 
turn on some soft music and leave the room to treat another patient. When the 
qi does arrive patients usually feel extremely relaxed. This is the 
&ldquo;acupuncture nap&rdquo; that patients look forward to, from which they 
awake feeling refreshed and invigorated. If knotted, their qi has become 
smooth; if deficient, it has become ample and good health will follow. Some 
acupuncturists, however, do not retain the needles in the body. They simply 
obtain the qi by manipulating the needle and then remove it, moving on to 
needling the next point.</p> 
<p>If you can&rsquo;t feel the qi, how can you tell if the treatment is 
working? The treatment is working if you get better, ie, your symptoms subside 
either within 24 hours or within a reasonable time period relative to the 
length of time you&rsquo;ve had the disorder and relative to your general 
health. For instance, if you&rsquo;ve had back pain for over five years, one 
treatment is not going to do it. Yes, energy can do anything, but energy (yang) 
has to move flesh (yin) and flesh is a lot less flexible than qi.</p> 
<p>Generally speaking you should evaluate your rate of progress using your 
common sense. Depending upon the seriousness of your condition &mdash; acute or 
chronic &mdash; for the best and longest lasting results, expect to return for 
a series of visits. One or two treatments per week is optimal to start, 
although even a single treatment will provide benefit. Some patients opt for 
regular maintenance visits weekly, monthly, or seasonally for system 
&ldquo;tune-ups.&rdquo;</p> 
<p><strong>What should I look for when choosing an acupuncturist? </strong></p>
<p>In some ways choosing an acupuncturist is just like choosing any kind of 
holistic health practitioner. You should feel immediately comfortable with 
whomever you are entrusting your most prized possession: your body and all its 
baggage. Since your first interaction will probably be over the phone, look for 
respect. Is your phone called returned promptly? Does the practitioner or 
receptionist give you her full attention? Are your questions answered well?</p> 
<p>The Buddha said that the right answer depends on asking the right question. 
So ask yourself: beyond effectiveness, what am I really looking for in a 
practitioner? The best acupuncturist for you is the person who is effective and 
meets your needs in the present moment. Are you looking for someone with whom 
you feel you can really connect? Or do you prefer a little more professional 
distance? Do you want someone who can speak from a western medical perspective? 
Do you want someone who can explain Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) to you 
in detail? Or advise about lifestyle? Most importantly, wait to make a decision 
about your practitioner until after your first visit.</p> 
<p>Look for a licensed acupuncturist. All six New England states require 
acupuncturists to pass the National Certification Commission for Acupuncture 
and Oriental Medicine examination in acupuncture in order to become a licensed 
acupuncturist. Some medical practitioners, such as MD, DO, chiropractors and 
others, are not required to fulfill the complete educational and clinical 
requirements of a licensed acupuncturist, yet they may still be allowed to 
practice acupuncture. Check your practitioner&rsquo;s credentials to ensure he 
or she is a licensed acupuncturist.</p> 
<p>Consider the length of time in practice. The longer a practitioner has been 
practicing, the better. Generally speaking five years guarantees that the 
training wheels are off. This does not mean you should never schedule with 
someone less experienced, especially if they come well-recommended or are very 
accessible, but give new practitioners extra scrutiny.</p> 
<p>Acupuncturists often treat more than one person at a time, using several 
rooms so they can interview one person while another patient 
&ldquo;cooks.&rdquo; An experienced practitioner can handle two, even three 
rooms. Beyond that you have to ask yourself how much individualized attention 
you&rsquo;re really going to get. Community style acupuncture is a new style of 
practice where several people are treated together in one room while laying in 
reclining chairs. Treatments focus mainly on points above the neck and below 
the elbows and knees so no clothing removal is required. While this type of 
treatment is very economical, there are trade-offs in privacy and 
individualized attention.</p> 
<p>The patient-practitioner relationship is an extremely subtle thing and all 
practitioners are responsible for creating a relationship that promotes 
healing. Your practitioner should never seem to be in hurry or to have anything 
on his mind other than your well-being. Hopefully this acupuncture information 
is helpful in guiding you along the next steps of your holistic healing journey.
