<h1>Alternative Therapies: Growing Options in Nursing Practice</h1> 
<p><b>Author: Marilyn Hanser, RN, BSN, MA</b> with excerpts written by <b>
Shelda L. Hudson, RN, BSN, PHN</b></p> 
<h2>Purpose and Goals</h2> 
<p>The goal of this course is for you to learn about the many options that 
complementary and alternative therapies have to offer. Much interest has 
stemmed from &quot;preventive&quot; care measures as one way to reduce health 
care costs. Vitamin, nutrition, and diet therapies abound. You will learn about 
the use of massage and other relaxation therapies for stress prevention and 
treatment. The established role of the nurse in seeing clients holistically, 
and intervening in all the dimensions - physical, psychological, intellectual, 
social, and spiritual - places the nurse in a unique position to give 
information and advice concerning these various new therapies.</p> 
<h2>Instructional Objectives</h2> 
<p>Upon completion of this course, the learner will be able to:</p> 
<ol> 
<li>Identify recent trends in health care that have led to today's interest in 
alternative practices.</li> 
<li>Select appropriate nursing diagnoses for referral to a Chinese Medicine 
practitioner.</li> 
<li>Select appropriate symptoms and illnesses that can be improved by 
acupuncture.</li> 
<li>Select three major concerns that patients should be warned about with 
regard to Chinese herbal medicine.</li> 
<li>Define stress and the effects it has on the body.</li> 
<li>Outline the role of prayer/meditation/guided imagery/mindfulness in 
nursing practice.</li> 
<li>Define the physiological and theoretical principles underlying the 
practice of osteopathic medicine.</li> 
<li>Recall the role of Therapeutic Touch in nursing practice.</li> 
<li>Recognize the strengths and limitations of massage therapy and 
chiropractics.</li>

assistance in using these methods.</li> </ol> 
<h2>Introduction</h2> 
<p>Traditional Western medicine (allopathic medicine), especially since the 
late nineteenth century, has been successful in treating and/or eradicating 
many diseases that had meant certain death. Much of the success comes from the 
use of scientific methodology in dealing with disease. Because of these 
scientific methods, surgical procedures and pharmacologic treatments were 
developed for illnesses affecting people of all ages. For example, antibiotics 
have severely limited the threat of many childhood illnesses while surgery, 
radiation, and chemotherapy are used for treating many types of cancer, and 
open-heart surgery has saved the lives of many with crippling heart disease. 
After the discoveries by Pasteur and Koch, the belief that disease could be 
eliminated through the studying, identifying, and conquering of germs became 
dominant in Western culture.</p> 
<p>The increasing use of surgery and pharmacology today to treat diseases, 
along with the increase in life expectancy because of these procedures, has 
dramatically increased health care costs. Some experts have postulated that the 
economics of health care has played a vital role in maintaining the 
&quot;disease&quot; mentality rather than encouraging consumer participation in 
one's own health care because powerful drug companies make money off diseases 
rather than off wellness. As the cost of American health care skyrockets, many 
health care practitioners are looking for ways to decrease the cost of 
delivering good care.</p> 
<p>For the past thirty years or so health educators have emphasized the 
importance of preventive care (concentrating on &quot;wellness&quot; as opposed 
to &quot;illnesses&quot;) as one way to reduce health care costs, since 
preventive measures are cheap in comparison with the cost of treating disease 
once it has already developed.</p> 
<p>In recent years this interest in prevention has deepened, and new 
therapies, referred to as &quot;alternative&quot; or &quot;comple mentary&quot; 
medicine, are now on the market. For example, many new and varied vitamin, 
nutrition, and diet therapies abound. The use of massage in stress prevention 
is widespread. Support groups are a less expensive, and sometimes more 
effective, way to provide mental health care than the traditional use of 
individual psychotherapy. Others of these &quot;new&quot; therapies are really 
not new, but instead are part of traditional medicine in other parts of the 
world. Acupuncture, herbal medicine, yoga and tai chi fall into this last 
category. Many traditionally trained Western health care practitioners are 
turning to these adjunct therapies as valuable sources of information and 
healing, especially when Western methods fail. Thus, a spirit of collaboration 
is forged between practitioners of both Western and Eastern medicine.</p> 
<p>A recent survey of 461 general practice physicians, designed to determine 
the general attitude of practitioners of traditional Western medicine toward 
complementary approaches to health care, found that 47% had been involved in 
complementary medicine in some form during the previous week. Of these 16% had 
actually used it themselves in the clinical setting while the rest had referred 
patients to other practitioners. They rated chiropractic, acupuncture, and 
osteopathy as the most effective therapies. Some HMOs are developing 
alternative medicine departments to include these new methods in the health 
care packages they offer their customers. This trend toward legitimizing 
alternative methods has been apparent in Europe for some time. For example, a 
hospital in Switzerland reserves two nursing units for the treatment of 
patients using Chinese herbal medicine and homeopathy; a department of 
complementary medicine is now available in a Swiss medical school; Finland has 
included acupuncture in its medical school curriculum for several years; and a 
complementary medicine section has been added to the curriculum of the Royal 
College of Nursing in the United Kingdom.</p> 
<p>Statistics show that in 1996 thirty-four percent of the US population used 
some form of alternative medicine to augment their health care. New NCCAM 
statistics show that number has increased to around 42%. Most of these people 
ranged in age from 25-49 years, and were highly educated with high-income 
levels; many paid for this care out of their own pocket. Those with poorer 
health were more likely to use alternative medicine than were those with better 
health. In six studies done on the use of alternative therapies in AIDS 
patients, researchers found that 30-50% of those with HIV sought some form of 
alternative care, not because they were dissatisfied with the traditional 
approach of allopathic medicine, but because they were seeking to improve 
immune functioning and overall health as an adjunct to conventional methods. 
The majority seeking alternative therapies, no matter what their diagnosis, 
gravitated to relaxation techniques, chiropractics, massage, guided imagery, 
and spiritual healing more frequently than they did to interventions that 
required the intake of any substance (although those with HIV did use vitamin 
therapies rather often). Most consumers of alternative therapies for serious 
diseases did not report this care to their allopathic physician. Because of 
this trend in the use of alternative care by the public, and the growing 
respect that many of these practitioners are receiving from traditional medical 
practitioners as well, the number of alternative practitioners is expected to 
increase by 88% by the year 2010.</p> 
<p>As the role of nurses in the health care delivery process shifts from the 
traditional hospital setting to private practices, community and business 
organizations, and home health care, nurses will be in a position to educate 
the public about these complementary approaches to modern medicine. The 
established role of the nurse in seeing clients holistically, and intervening 
in all the dimensions of human existence - physical, psychological, 
intellectual, social, and spiritual - places the nurse in a unique position to 
give information and advice concerning these various new therapies, many of 
which stress the importance of the holistic approach to health care.</p> 
<h2>Traditional Chinese Medicine</h2> 
<h3>Development</h3> 
<p>Most practices of traditional Chinese medicine trace their roots to the Han 
Dynasty of about two thousand years ago. This was an age of philosophical, 
cultural, and medical importance in Chinese history. At that time there were 
attempts made to unify the various practices into one cohesive body of 
medicine. Over the centuries Chinese medicine has been influenced by other 
Asian cultures so that today's practices have a combination of Japanese, 
Korean, and Southeast Asian influence.</p> 
<p>While Chinese medicine has had a following in the United States since the 
1700's, the unifying of various practices into a single body of medicine in the 
mid-twentieth century has made it easier to mainstream its use in the United 
States. There are now approximately seventy schools of Chinese medicine in the 
US. They train non- physician practitioners in three to four-year programs.</p> 
<h3>Diagnosis</h3> 
<p>Chinese medicine focuses on identifying patterns of symptoms that reflect 
energy blockages within the body. The practitioner examines the skin, bones, 
body odors, body sounds, body build, pulse, the tongue, the patient's mental 
state, and the patient's demeanor. This examination of the exterior provides 
clues to the interior state of health. The pulse, as one example, provides 
information on body energy flow and blockage through assessment at various 
positions in the body such as the wrist, neck, and leg. The practitioner 
assesses pulse strength, length, its trailing characteristics, and what happens 
between pulse beats. These findings can be documented scientifically, with an 
oscilloscope. The practitioner assesses many seemingly unrelated areas such as 
sleep and elimination patterns, digestion, emotional makeup, sex drive, and 
menstrual patterns.</p> 
<p>These observations are recorded and reassessed at future appointments to 
determine the effectiveness of the treatment regimen. Areas of treatment that 
need to be amended to meet the needs of the individual patient are also 
determined.</p> 
<p>Nursing diagnoses which might lead a nurse to suggest a patient try a 
Chinese medicine practitioner (especially if the patient has already undergone 
treatment by a Western trained physician and had limited results) include:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>sleep pattern disturbance</li> 
<li>constipation and/or diarrhea</li> 
<li>chronic pain</li> 
<li>altered sexuality patterns</li> 
<li>altered urinary elimination pattern.</li> </ul> 
<h3>Acupuncture</h3> 
<p>Acupuncture is part of the Chinese system of medicine - a philosophy of 
healing - developed over thousands of years.</p> 
<p>Acupuncture is defined by the California Business and Professions Code, 
Section 4927, as: &quot;The stimulation of points on or near the surface of the 
body by the insertion of needles to prevent or modify the perception of pain or 
to normalize physiological functions, including pain control, for the treatment 
of certain diseases or dysfunctions of the body.&quot; There are four types of 
acupuncture currently used in the U.S, known as medical, ethnic Chinese, 
Japanese and Auricular.</p> 
<p>The needles inserted are thin, sterile, and usually disposable; the 
insertion usually takes place while the patient rests in a reclining position. 
The insertion goes to a point just below the surface of the skin in the 
epidural layer and may last anywhere from a few seconds to forty minutes. It 
may cause some tingling, aching, numbness, and/or a feeling of warmth and 
heaviness. The locations of the insertion are determined by the diagnosis and 
treatment goals, but usually involve several different spots on the body at a 
time. Sometimes, the needles are moved to other spots during a session, 
depending on feedback from the continuous pulse readings. Some practitioners 
remain with the patient throughout the process while others leave them to rest 
while the needles are working.</p> 
<p>Scientific support for the effectiveness of acupuncture comes from 
understanding its physiological effects. It appears to activate several of the 
body's systems, such as the electromagnetic system (acupuncture points are more 
conductive than the surrounding tissue), and the chemical responses of the 
nervous system, the vascular system, and the lymph system. Acupuncture causes 
the release of neurotransmitters such as endorphins, serotonin, and enkephalins 
(which recently have been documented as natural painkillers) as well as 
anti-inflammatory agents such as cortisol. Beyond this, little is understood 
about how or why acupuncture works. Many studies report relief from symptoms 
after acupuncture treatments, but none of the studies have been done under 
conditions applying the strict Western principles of research design; 
therefore, many Western trained physicians and researchers remain skeptical 
about the results of these studies. Some say that the relief from symptoms may 
be nothing more than a placebo effect.</p> 
<p>Nevertheless, the magnitude of the above cited reports suggests that 
acupuncture may be effective for the treatment of low back pain, tooth 
extractions, nausea, angina, migraine and tension headaches, dysmenorrhea, and 
substance abuse. One study in the US, in a managed care setting, showed those 
receiving acupuncture had a decrease in the number of times they accessed the 
system. There were fewer clinic visits, phone consultations, and laboratory 
uses, as well as fewer hospitalizations, and a decrease in the use of 
prescription drugs.</p> 
<p>Other studies have shown acupuncture to be beneficial for GI disturbances, 
such as nausea and vomiting. It has been tested as an option for drug addiction 
recovery treatment decreasing drug cravings and withdrawal symptoms.</p>

<p>The number of sessions depends on the illness treated, as well as on the 
needs of the individual. On the average, treatments are once or twice a week 
for several weeks, with appointments spaced further apart as the treatment 
progresses.</p>

<h3>Chinese Herbal Medicine</h3> 
<h1>If you have a patient who is using herbal remedies, make sure you inform 
him (or her) of the following:</h1> 
<ul> 
<li>Commmercial preparations may vary significantly in dosages from different 
brands making it risky to change brands, since the new brand may cause adverse 
reactions if the dosage is significantly higher than that of the previous brand.
</li> 
<li>Herbal extracts are much stronger than whole herbs, so your patient should 
know which form he is using.</li> 
<li>Excessive dosages can lead to toxicity, resulting in rashes, urticaria, 
diarrhea and/or other gastrointestinal problems.</li> </ul> 
<p>Figure 2</p> <br>

<p>Many of our modern Western medicines have their origins in some kind of 
plant or herb. Some examples: morphine comes from the opium poppy seed, aspirin 
comes from the bark of the willow tree, and digitalis comes from the foxglove 
plant. These substances have been scientifically tested, and their use strictly 
controlled, safe dosages were determined, adverse reactions assessed, and 
guidelines for their use developed and approved by the FDA. Chinese herbs 
easily lend themselves to such Western-style research methods, similar to other 
pharmaceuticals, and their effectiveness can be readily demonstrated to the 
skeptical Western mind. Their potential for use in the treatment of certain 
cancers and heart disease is certainly promising and merits further research. 
Currently many of these herbal preparations are not classified as drugs, and so 
are not regulated by the FDA.</p> 
<p>Because they are not regulated, there are many popular preparations that 
have not undergone the rigorous testing required for FDA approval. These 
preparations are not necessarily prescribed by certified herbal practitioners, 
so the consumer is often unaware of possible adverse reactions from the 
indiscriminate use of these herbs.</p> 
<p>Find out if a certified practitioner has prescribed them. If not, encourage 
the patient to consult with a certified experienced herbologist or a pharmacist 
to insure the safety of the dosage and the purpose for taking the preparation.
</p> 
<p>It is also important to stress that the patient should inform the primary 
caregiver that he is taking the herbal remedy in case there are potential 
adverse reactions between the herbal preparation and any conventional medicines 
the patient may be taking. If your patient is pregnant, the use of herbal 
remedies should be discouraged until she has consulted a physician because many 
of these preparations are uterine stimulants and/or diuretics.</p> 
<h2>Mind/Body Medicine</h2> 
<p>The practice of mind/body medicine crosses all health care disciplines. 
Many healthcare professionals practice it. The interventions used in mind/body 
medicine are taught one-on-one as well as in groups, and as part of both 
inpatient and outpatient programs. They may be used as preventive measures for 
major illness(es) in those indicating tendencies towards such illness(es). They 
may also be part of the treatment plan for those already suffering from major 
illnesses; for example, to decrease the side effects of chemotherapy, or to 
increase the chance of successful surgery intervention.</p> 
<h3>Nursing Diagnosis</h3> 
<p>The importance of the nursing diagnosis involving mind/body medicine is the 
impact natural treatment has on the nurse's role in providing health care. 
Nurses may use independently many &quot;natural&quot; therapies (those not 
requiring pharmaceuticals or surgery) to promote healing. This is gradually 
changing the role of the nurse from that of a caregiver to a healer.</p> 
<p>Nursing diagnoses for which mind/body interventions may prove useful 
include, but are not limited to:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>anxiety</li> 
<li>body image disturbance</li> 
<li>fear</li> 
<li>anticipatory grieving</li> 
<li>hopelessness and powerlessness</li> 
<li>sleep pattern disturbance</li> 
<li>impaired social interaction</li> 
<li>social isolation</li> 
<li>spiritual distress</li> </ul> 
<h3>Mind/Body Interventions</h3> 
<p>In the broadest sense, mind/body medicine means changing one's lifestyle to 
promote health and prevent illness. Practitioners encourage their clients to 
incorporate various interventions into their daily lives to promote optimal 
health. This can include changing exercise patterns, and finding a social 
support system that can help relieve the stress inherent in modern living. Few 
techniques are used individually. Depending on the specific needs of the 
individual client, they may be used in conjunction with each other.</p> 
<p>Meditation is one of the most widespread interventions in the mind/body 
repertoire. It is useful in helping patients to deal with a variety of 
stress-producing psychological problems associated with illnesses, such as 
decreased independence caused by hospitalization, feelings of isolation, 
anxiety, depression, and changes in body image. When combined with guided 
imagery and/or therapeutic touch, it can be a powerful nursing intervention in 
a wide variety of nursing settings such as nursing homes, hospices, and 
hospitals; and for a wide variety of illnesses such as the side-effects of 
chemotherapy and radiation in treating cancer patients, AIDS related problems, 
heart disease, postpartum depression, and anxiety of new mothers.</p> 
<p>Evidence shows that brain waves are different during a state of relaxation 
than they are during tension or anxiety. When relaxed, the brain is in a more 
receptive state and, therefore, more open to new ideas.</p> 
<p>Mental imagery uses this suggestible state by creating symbols to imagine 
specific positive changes occurring in the body, such as the cancer cells 
attacked by cells of the immune system.</p> 
<p>Studies show the technique of mental imagery creates positive physiological 
changes to boost the immune system functioning. Research indicates that 
depression, the stress of losing a sense of control over life situations, and 
an emotionally repressive life-style, can contribute to immune system 
dysfunction. Positive emotions have positive effects on S-IgA levels. This 
reduces the size of tumors, increases the number of lymphocytes fighting the 
tumor, and increases NK (natural killer) cell activity.</p> 
<p>Guided imagery is closely related to mental imagery except it is usually 
performed by a health care professional rather than auto-induced. It is often 
used in support group settings where everyone is in the process simultaneously, 
and can share their responses. It can be fascinating to see how differently 
individuals internalize the same words spoken by the facilitator. Such 
experiences of individuality can provide great insight into one's own 
psychological makeup. As a result, individuals often become kinder to 
themselves, which in turn reduces their stress level, thus improving immune 
function and overall health.</p> 
<p>Practitioners of meditation caution that it may take awhile before tangible 
health benefits are seen. Patients should be encouraged to continue the 
practices even if they get impatient for results and want to stop.</p> 
<p>A relatively new technique in mind/body medicine is called 
&quot;thought-field therapy,&quot; developed by Dr. Roger Callahan, a 
psychologist interested in applying eastern and western medical practices in a 
variety of hybrid approaches. It is believed to work on the energy patterns 
surrounding a specific thought and its related feelings. Thought-field therapy 
intervenes between the thought and the negative emotional content of the 
thought, to either neutralize or completely remove it before the negative 
energy has a chance to damage the body. Afterward, the person can think in a 
more positive, clear, and hopeful manner, leading to better overall health and 
functioning.</p> 
<p>Thought-field therapy is used in the treatment of negative or upsetting 
emotions and has been found to be especially useful in the relief of chronic 
worrying, anxiety, panic disorders, phobias, and memories surrounding traumatic 
events. The therapy is done by having the client concentrate on the specific 
problematic thoughts and feelings.</p> 
<p>Biofeedback is a technique that uses special instruments attached to the 
body to provide the person information about what is occurring in the body at a 
given moment. The testing instruments pick up very subtle signals within the 
body (signals of which the person may be completely unaware); these signals 
then help the person see where impediments to relaxation may be occurring. An 
EMG (electromyograph) is often the instrument used in biofeedback sessions. 
Sensors that measure electrical activity in the muscles are attached to the 
skin. These readings help determine the amount of tension existing in the 
muscles by emitting small sounds or by visual indications; the client may then 
attempt to relax the muscle further until a state of complete relaxation has 
been achieved.</p> 
<p>Therapeutic Touch is a healing method developed by Dolores Krieger, PhD, RN 
in the 1970s. It is based on the principle that the human energy system extends 
above the skin, and the practitioner can use the hands as sensors to locate 
problems within the body.</p> 
<p>Disease is seen as a condition of energy imbalance or flow blockage which 
can be assessed by moving the hands over the body at a distance of about two to 
four inches above the body surface. The practitioner serves as a conduit 
through which the blocked energy flow is corrected. This method can be used 
without ever touching the body so it is good for physical conditions in which 
the body cannot tolerate contact, as for post-surgery or burn patients. 
Sessions typically last about 30 minutes and are performed with the patient 
fully clothed. Therapeutic Touch is taught in over eighty universities and 
practiced by approximately thirty thousand health care professionals throughout 
the world.</p> 
<p>Breath therapy is another technique that is often used in trying to induce 
a state of relaxation. It helps release tension, anxiety and pain, and is often 
used along with mental imagery and/or autosuggestion. Sometimes breath therapy 
is not used to induce immediate relaxation, but rather to evoke strong emotions 
so that these emotions, which are often blocks to relaxation, can be released. 
Once these strong emotions are released, the client may be more successful in 
inducing the relaxation response.</p> 
<p>Over the last few decades the medical establishment has attempted to ease 
this problem by developing support groups for those afflicted with major 
illnesses of our modern age. When used in conjunction with other therapies, 
this approach is valuable in treating many diseases. Being with others who are 
suffering in similar ways reduces the sense of isolation and loneliness that 
accompanies many of these diagnoses. It provides a regular format (usually 
weekly meetings) for teaching new coping methods, training in guided imagery, 
breath therapy, and other forms of stress release. It also provides a safe 
environment for learning how to express emotions in a healthy way, and teaching 
new nutrition and exercise regimes.</p> 
<p>As stated earlier, most practitioners of mind/body medicine do not rely on 
just one of these techniques or interventions, but use them in conjunction with 
one another to provide an individualized approach to health care promotion.</p> 
<p>Multi-strategy regimens have been developed for other illnesses as well. 
Heart attack survivors have been able to reduce their death rate by half using 
mind/body techniques such as stress management and support group therapy; 
coronary artery blockage is almost always reduced by changing diet, exercise 
patterns, practicing yoga, and attending support group meetings. Cancer 
patients receiving lessons in guided imagery, relaxation training, breath 
therapy, training in problem-solving techniques, and support group time showed 
evidence of increased psychological well-being as measured by increased 
emotional expressiveness, higher levels of positive coping, and increased 
survival times.</p> 
<p>One of the oldest forms of mind/body medicine is yoga. This practice has 
had a profound impact on the fields of stress reduction, mind/body 
interventions, and energy medicine. The word itself means a union between the 
physical, mental, and spiritual dimensions of life and is therefore 
philosophically compatible with the concept of holistic health. Many physical 
postures, breathing exercises, and meditation practices are similar to those 
previously mentioned in this section. Classes are usually available through the 
local YMCA and YWCA, and in many towns. It is a good place to start for a 
comprehensive approach to holistic health practices.</p> 
<h3>The Stress Factor</h3> 
<p>Stress Stress Stress Stress . . . It goes on and on. You can hardly pick up 
a newspaper or magazine or watch TV without seeing or hearing some reference to 
stress. Why all of a sudden focus and fascination? After all, stress has been 
around since Adam and Eve were evicted from the Garden of Eden. Is it because 
there is more stress today? Is it because the nature of contemporary stress is 
somehow different and more dangerous? Or is it because scientific research has 
increasingly confirmed the crucial role stress can play in causing and 
aggravating different disorders and the diverse mechanisms of actions 
responsible for mediating its countless effects? Yes. Yes. Yes . . .</p> 
<p>The word stress comes from the Latin term, strictus, which means to be 
drawn tight. This concept from physics has to do with the measurement of strain 
on metal materials and its ability to withstand pressure.</p> 
<p>The stress response of the body is somewhat like an Indy car revving at the 
starting line. Virtually all systems (the heart and blood vessels, the lungs, 
the digestive system, the sensory organs, the immune system, and brain) are 
geared up to meet the perceived danger.</p> 
<p>Stress is an unavoidable consequence of life. According to Hans Selye, the 
most widely recognized authority on stress, &quot;Without stress, there would 
be no life&quot;. However, just as distress can cause disease, it seems 
reasonable that there are good stresses that promote wellness. Stress is not 
always necessarily harmful. Winning a race or contest can be just as stressful 
as losing, or more so, but may trigger different biological responses. 
Increased stress results in increased productivity - up to a point. However, 
this level differs for each of us. It's much like the stress on a violin 
string. Not enough produces a dull, raspy sound. Too much tension makes a 
shrill, annoying noise or snaps the string. However, just the right degree can 
create a magnificent tone. Similarly, we all need to find the proper level of 
stress that allows us to perform optimally and make melodious music as we go 
through life.</p> 
<p>According to Time magazine stress was considered &quot;The Epidemic of the 
Eighties&quot;, and our leading health problem as a nation at that time. It is 
without a doubt that the situation has progressively worsened since then. 
Numerous surveys confirm that adult Americans perceive they are under much more 
stress than a decade or two ago. It has been estimated that 75 -90 percent of 
all visits to primary care physicians are for stress related problems. Job 
stress is the leading source of stress for adults. Stress levels have also 
escalated in children, teenagers, college students and the elderly for other 
reasons, including: increased crime, violence and other threats to personal 
safety; destructive peer pressures that lead to substance abuse and other 
unhealthy lifestyle habits; social isolation and loneliness; the erosion of 
family and religious values and ties; the loss of other strong sources of 
social support that are powerful stress busters.</p>

<h3> How Has Stress Changed and Become More Dangerous?</h3> 
<p>Contemporary stress tends to be more pervasive, persistent and insidious 
because it stems primarily from psychological than physical threats. It is 
associated with ingrained and immediate reactions over which we have little 
control that were originally designed to be beneficial such as:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>heart rate and blood pressure soar to increase the flow of blood to the 
brain to improve decision making,</li> 
<li>blood sugar rises to furnish more fuel for energy as the result of the 
breakdown of glycogen, fat and protein stores,</li> 
<li>blood is shunted away from the gut, where it not immediately needed for 
purposes of digestion, to the large muscles of the arms and legs to provide 
more strength in combat, or greater speed in getting away from a scene of 
potential peril,</li> 
<li>clotting occurs more quickly to prevent blood loss from lacerations or 
internal hemorrhage.</li> </ul> 
<p>These and a myriad of other immediate and autonomic responses, have been 
exquisitely honed over time as life saving measures to facilitate the ability 
to deal with physical challenges. However, the nature of stress for modern man 
is not an occasional confrontation with a saber-toothed tiger or a hostile 
warrior but rather a host of emotional threats like getting stuck in traffic 
and fights with customers, co-workers, or family members, that often occur 
several times a day. Unfortunately, our bodies still react with these same, 
ancient fight or flight responses that are now potentially damaging and deadly. 
Repeatedly invoked, it is not hard to see how they can contribute to 
hypertension, strokes, heart attacks, diabetes, ulcers, neck or low back pain.

<h1>There are five specific nursing interventions related to the spiritual 
dimension:</h1> 
<ul> 
<li>Prayer</li> 
<li>The use of Scripture</li> 
<li>Providing a centered presence</li> 
<li>Active listening</li> 
<li>Referral</li> </ul> 
<p>Figure 4</p> <br>

<p>However, the body may contain it's own best pharmacy. There is vast innate 
potential that resides in each of us for preventing disease and promoting 
health. Good health is more than just the absence of illness. Rather, it is a 
positive state of physical and emotional well being, that acknowledges the 
importance and inseparability of mind/body relationships. Our goal should be to 
learn how to harness stress, so that it can work in a positive, more 
productive, rather than self- destructive manner. Highly conditioned athletes 
display a stress response that rises quickly in a competition then falls 
quickly back down. We should aim for that same condition - through diet, 
exercise and a resolution to stop hitting the refrigerator or the bar when 
things get tense. A lot of it depends on attitude.</p> 
<p>Although the exact physiological mechanism by which spirituality to heal 
illness has not been determined, prayer has been demonstrated to stimulate 
healing. It is thought that prayer stimulates the relaxation response and 
enhances the immune system. Nurses in holistic practices concede that there is 
an element of mystery in the use of prayer for healing. Many attribute this 
mysterious component to the assistance of a &quot;higher power&quot; in the 
healing process. This &quot;higher power&quot; is often referred to as God.</p> 
<p>Holistic nurses report that intervention in the healing process with prayer 
helps clients cope with anxieties surrounding their diagnoses and their loved 
ones. Prayer is also seen as an important tool to deepen the nurse/client bond 
that is often so crucial in healing.</p> 
<h2>Interventions that Manipulate Body Parts</h2> 
<h3>Massage Therapy</h3> 
<p>Healers from most cultures throughout history have used hands-on 
manipulation as a significant part of their healing traditions. Despite the 
wide variety of massage techniques they all tend to hold certain key 
physiological principles in common. These principles are:</p> 
<ol> 
<li>Massage improves blood circulation by releasing tension in the muscles. 
This improved circulation improves the supply of nutrients to the body's organs 
and increases the removal of toxins and waste from the body's tissues.</li> 
<li>Improved circulation of lymphatic fluid aids in the removal of toxins and 
waste.</li> 
<li>Chronic muscle tension from stress or injury can adversely affect body 
structure and function. The use of massage therapy can help restore proper 
musculoskeletal function by releasing muscle tension.</li> 
<li>Because there is a strong connection between the body and mind, mental 
health may be improved and psychosomatic ailments decreased through the use of 
massage.</li> </ol> 
<p>Scientific support through controlled studies demonstrates the 
effectiveness of massage as part of an overall health care plan. Studies show 
its effectiveness for a wide variety of ailments. Studies are currently being 
conducted to determine the effectiveness of massage in a variety of other 
ailments as well. Some of these include addicted infants, colic, infants whose 
mothers are depressed, abused and/or autistic children, post traumatic stress, 
eating disorders, and fibro myalgia.</p> 
<p>A major advantage of massage therapy is its usefulness to combat the 
symptoms in a wide variety of stress-related diseases and ailments. While it 
has few contraindications, there is concern that it might spread cancer cells, 
spread communicable skin diseases, or cause the dislodging of a blood clot. In 
such cases, massage is not recommended unless affected areas of the body can be 
worked around.</p> 
<p>Structural/Functional Movement methods of massage are used to reinstate 
balance within the body as well as to improve the ease of movement and are 
often used in conjunction with deep tissue massage. There are several 
variations of structural/functional methods. Some are:</p> 
<ol> 
<li>Rolfing is the most established method in the US with approximately seven 
hundred current practitioners. It is a form of deep tissue massage used 
primarily to bring the body back into alignment by loosening muscle adhesions, 
which keep the muscles from moving as easily as they were designed for.</li> 
<li>The Trager method is a system of movement re-education using gentle 
movements to release deep physical and psychological patterns that prevent 
relaxation and flexibility. The client is taught a system of movements designed 
to increase a sense of lightness and ease in their movements.</li> </ol> 
<p>Oriental massage methods are based on the principles of Chinese medicine 
and the changes of energy flow within the body. The most common in this country 
are Acupressure and Shiatsu (Shiatsu was actually developed in Japan). These 
methods are based on applying finger and palm pressure to specific points to 
improve the efficiency and balance of energy in the body. It is believed that 
impeding of energy flow is caused by tension within the body's muscles which 
must be released before it causes muscle and organ damage.</p> 
<p>Reflexology is becoming increasingly popular and involves the stimulation 
of specific points on the ears, hands, and feet that are believed to 
correspond, or &quot;reflex&quot;, through a complex neurological system to 
specific areas and organs of the body. Pressure applied to these reflex points 
releases tension, improves circulation, and restores the balance of the body's 
energy flow.</p> 
<h3>Chiropractic Medicine</h3> 
<p>Chiropractic medicine is a non- pharmaceutical and nonsurgical approach 
that involves hands-on manipulation of the musculoskeletal system as a means of 
primary treatment. Chiropractors are the second largest group of primary care 
providers in the US. They are second only to physicians, and they receive 
roughly 2/3 of all health care visits for back pain. Roughly ten percent of the 
population use chiropractic medicine.</p> 
<p>There are several key principles underlying the practice of chiropractic 
medicine. The first one, the vitalistic principle, states that the body can 
heal itself from within through the flow of energy in the body's nervous 
system. By manipulating the spine and joints through which the flow occurs, 
chiropractors believe that they remove barriers to the body's natural healing 
power. Chiropractors also believe in the holistic principle, but see the 
nervous system as the master of all other body systems, and thus the nervous 
system is the key to making the entire network of systems function at their 
highest level.</p> 
<p>For chiropractors, the musculoskeletal system plays a key role in 
understanding how the body functions. They see biological functioning as a 
by-product of biological structure. Since the musculoskeletal system provides 
the body's structure, it plays a critical role in maintaining a healthy body 
function. Illness is the result of flaws in musculoskeletal structure that 
impact the nervous system and cause disease in corresponding parts of the body. 
Subluxations (a state in which a joint is only partially dislocated) occurring 
in the spinal column account for much of the body's poor functioning, and are 
from a modern lifestyle which is inconsistent with the way the body was 
designed. Subluxations are common and often the result of a sedentary 
life-style, such as sitting for prolonged periods of time which is hard on the 
spine, and lack of exercise.</p> 
<p>There are variations in the practice of chiropractic medicine. Some limit 
their practice solely to subluxations of the spine and its immediate 
connections to the nervous system. Most practitioners bring in concepts from 
diverse health care disciplines and have a broader scope of practice. They use 
nutritional supplementation, Chinese medicine, naturopathy, homeopathy, 
massage, and mind/body medicine. Each uses a unique combination, which allows 
flexibility in meeting the needs of their clients. Other practitioners take a 
more allopathic approach to healing, such as the diagnosis of disease followed 
by referral for treatment, if warranted, or followed by chiropractic treatment 
of the disease.</p> 
<blockquote> What happens in the mind of man is always reflected in the 
disease of his body ...<br>
-Ren&eacute; Dubos- </blockquote> 
<p> Preliminary studies revealed an increase in monocyte functioning after 
chiropractic adjustment, suggesting a possible link between spinal manipulation 
and immune functioning.</p> 
<p>Treatment usually begins with a medical history questionnaire that is 
filled out prior to the first visit. This is followed by a physical exam, much 
like that given by a physician, which assesses whether the client is a good 
candidate for chiropractic treatment by measuring leg length, muscle tone, heel 
tension, and other musculoskeletal features. Once a diagnosis is made, then 
treatment follows using a variety of therapies such as: physiotherapy, 
adjustments to problem areas to reduce subluxations and to restore normal joint 
function, and manipulations such as stretching or traction to relieve adhesions 
that may have built up from an old injury and which may be impeding flexibility.
</p> 
<p>Chiropractic medicine's greatest strength lies in its treatment of 
musculoskeletal problems such as sprains, low back problems, headaches, neck 
stiffness, and joint conditions. Chiropractors do not treat fractures or acute 
infections, perform surgery or trauma care, or prescribe pharmaceutical 
medication.</p> 
<p>The chiropractor/client relationship is another strength of this approach 
to health care. The need for constant communication between the practitioner 
and the client during treatment sessions usually makes for a warm and empathic 
relationship.</p> 
<p>For more information on chiropractics, you can contact one of the several 
professional organizations for this discipline. The American Chiropractic 
Association publishes the Journal of the American Chiropractic Association, 
emphasizes ethical and professional conduct, conducts research, and is involved 
in lobbying for laws that support the profession. Phone 800/986-4636, Website:

<h3>Osteopathic Medicine</h3> 
<p>An American Civil War surgeon named Andrew Still founded osteopathic 
medicine. Like Chiropractics, the theory he developed emphasizes the importance 
of viewing the body's health holistically by integrating its inherent healing 
powers, its communication and regulatory feedback mechanisms, and the pivotal 
role of the musculoskeletal system into a system of thought to promote health 
maintenance and fight disease. While this doesn't sound particularly innovative 
by today's standards, it was innovative for the time in which Dr. Still lived. 
During the Civil War and the post-war period, American medicine was not 
particularly scientific in nature, and considered unorganized.</p> 
<p>Still founded the first school of osteopathic medicine in 1892. Its 
curriculum contained courses similar to those taught in allopathic schools, but 
stressed the importance of the relationship between structure and function, and 
focused on the importance of the structure of the musculoskeletal system in 
overall body function. He saw interplay between the mechanics of joint function 
and the performance of muscles and ligaments, which impacts vascular flow and 
the function of the nervous system. He believed improving the circulation, and 
maintaining the body's highly tuned regulatory system (which involves the 
vascular and nervous system communication and feedback loops) was the best way 
to insure optimum health.</p> 
<p>Dr. Still taught that manipulative therapies, performed on parts of the 
musculoskeletal system, would improve the blood supply throughout the body. 
Improved blood supply would improve the nervous system function. This emphasis 
on the musculoskeletal system is what lends the name &quot;osteopathy.&quot;</p>
<p>Like chiropractors, osteopaths view disease as caused by disturbances in 
the particular location on the spinal column, which supplies the nerves to the 
particular organ that is malfunctioning.</p> 
<p>Like Chiropractics, Doctors of Osteopathy (DOs) were not accepted as part 
of mainstream medicine until the emphasis on holistic health began to surface 
in the last few decades. It wasn't until 1972 that all states allowed DOs to 
apply for licensure, and later they were allowed to practice in allopathic 
hospitals. Currently there are approximately 50,000 DOs and seventeen 
osteopathic medical schools in the United States. DOs are now eligible for AMA 
membership, and they have their own professional organization, the American 
Osteopathic Association. Many allopathic physicians recognize that the emphasis 
on musculoskeletal functioning has an impact on many disease processes and 
train themselves in that aspect of osteopathic medicine. Osteopaths see 
themselves as a separate, but equal profession to MDs. However, they do not 
want to lose what makes them unique by abandoning their own organizations in 
favor of admission into the AMA. DO training is similar to allopathic 
physicians, although there is a greater emphasis on preventive medicine, and 
more training in musculoskeletal physiology and manipulative interventions. 
Studies confirm that the quality of medical knowledge of MDs and DOs is 
comparable.</p> 
<p>The underlying principles of osteopathic medicine include:</p> 
<ol> 
<li>holism in the form of a balanced musculoskeletal system</li> 
<li>the relationship of structure and function as well as the relationship 
between one's emotions and the body's structure</li> 
<li>the importance of blood circulation to overall health</li> 
<li>the body's innate attempt to maintain a healthy state</li> 
<li>the importance of manipulative therapies in stimulating the body's ability 
to maintain health</li> 
<li>the existence of a pre-disease state that warns the alert practitioner 
that this part of the body is close to some kind of breakdown in health, and
</li> 
<li>education on lifestyle choices that are conducive to good health.</li> 
</ol> 
<p>There are some differences in the ways that DOs actually practice their 
art. Some are loyal to the idea that manipulation is central to the practice of 
osteopathy, but the majority of DOs use many allopathic approaches in their 
work with patients. DOs easily integrate homeopathy, naturopathy, Chinese 
medicine, and mind/body medicine into their practices. Osteopaths are able to 
specialize in the same fields in which allopaths specialize, but approximately 
half of them go into primary care medicine instead.</p> 
<p>A survey of 100 practicing DOs showed that 71% of them used manipulative 
therapies with only 5% of their patients, and only 14% used manipulation with 
over half of their patients. Some predictors for using manipulation therapy:</p>
<ol> 
<li>having learned a new format since graduating from school</li> 
<li>interest in these therapies during internship and</li> 
<li>family members who are DOs.</li> </ol> 
<p>Specialty, emphasis in school, and era of training were not significant in 
this study.</p> 
<p>Other studies show that DOs entering the primary care fields, especially 
those entering family practice, are more likely to use manipulative techniques 
in their practice than those entering more specialized fields. The authors of 
one study suggest that this difference in practice styles starts in medical 
school. With this in mind, they encourage DO medical schools to provide greater 
emphasis on manipulative medicine. The American &shy;Osteopath Association has 
developed a medical school program with primary care specialization beyond the 
basic medical school requirements.</p> 
<p>A common theme throughout many professional osteopathic journals is the 
concern that osteopaths, in moving away from manipulative techniques, are 
losing much of what makes them unique in comparison to other health care 
providers. There seems to be widespread concern that as DOs become accepted by 
allopathic providers, they will be absorbed by the more traditional approaches 
and eventually cease to exist as a group with their own unique approaches and 
philosophical underpinnings. Concerned osteopaths emphasize the importance of 
maintaining an emphasis on manipulative techniques and prevention-oriented 
holistic care if the profession is to survive as a separate entity from 
allopathic medicine.</p> 
<p>Scientific support for the theory behind osteopathic medicine comes from 
research conducted over the past few decades and is, at times, 
indistinguishable from allopathic theory. There are a few studies that have 
been conducted to test theory that is unique to osteopathic medicine.</p> 
<p>A study compared the musculoskeletal differences between psychotic patients 
and those with affective disorders. This study concluded that there were, 
indeed, significant differences. The psychotic patients had more structural 
problems in the midcervical regions of the spine and the lower extremities, 
while those with affective disorders had more problems associated with the 
thoracic region of the spine.</p> 
<p>Recent studies demonstrate the usefulness of osteopathic medicine in 
treating low back pain, muscle contraction headaches, herniated discs, 
peripheral nerve problems, chronic shoulder pain, decreased range of motion 
associated with old age, and fibromyalgias. Osteopathic manipulations have 
proven particularly helpful in these cases when combined with self-help 
training. DOs treat hypertension, generalized muscle pain, fatigue, sleep 
problems, children infected with measles, and childhood respiratory disorders.
</p> 
<p>Manipulative therapies have proven useful in reducing the length of the 
course of antibiotics needed in the treatment of pneumonia in elderly 
individuals in reducing the number of attacks and medication needed in the 
treatment of asthma sufferers, and in relieving the symptoms and reducing the 
length of acute episodes in those with COPD.</p> 
<p>Osteopathic diagnosis is made using the standard approaches of allopathic 
medicine, but DOs also employ palpation and other touch techniques to assess 
skin temperature, range of motion, and pain. In addition to the standard 
physical exam and history taken by the allopathic physician, the osteopath 
assesses body alignment, posture, and muscle movement to obtain further 
information, which might suggest particular treatment methods.</p> 
<p>Treatment often involves a combination of allopathic pharmaceutical 
interventions with osteopathic manipulation. All interventions are made with 
the importance of blood circulation in mind. Some of these interventions 
include:</p> 
<ol> 
<li>Lymphatic Pump - a procedure which manipulates the spine and rib cage 
through the use of rhythmic pumping of the practitioner's hands to improve 
circulation in the chest cavity and encourage draining of the lymph system</li> 
<li>Simple range of motion exercises - Muscle energy is released to improve 
the range of motion by contracting certain muscles in a controlled way so that 
stored energy, which can cause muscle tension, can be released. A variety of 
isometric, isotonic, and isolytic exercises are used to improve the 
relationship among various interacting muscle groups.</li> 
<li>Thrust techniques, similar to those used in chiropractic medicine, to 
realign joints</li> 
<li>Posture improvement to relieve pressure on injured tissues</li> 
<li>Release of facial and cranial tension and improved circulation of the 
cranial drainage system through manipulation of the muscles, their attending 
fascia, and nearby cranial suture lines</li> 
<li>Manipulation of the viscera to improve mobility and positioning of 
internal organs and tissues</li> </ol> 
<p>The biggest strength of osteopathic medicine is its ability to incorporate 
the theories and techniques of many other types of treatment into its practice. 
The osteopath will use theory and drugs from allopathic medicine along with 
techniques from mind/body medicine and/or Chinese herbs. The hands-on 
techniques of manipulation are beneficial because they bring an intimate 
atmosphere into the treatment setting. Osteopathic patients are more likely to 
report feelings of caring and compassion from their practitioner than patients 
of allopathic practitioners.</p> 
<p>While an interpersonal relationship between practitioner and patient is 
vital to the success of osteopathic treatment, some osteopathic practitioners 
align themselves closely with allopathic practices. A potential patient should 
evaluate whether an individual osteopath is able to meet their particular 
needs. For example, an osteopath that follows the typical structure of the 
15-minute office visit might be unable to respond to questions that might come 
up during the course of treatment. Those who space their appointments further 
apart can be flexible should additional time be needed.</p> 
<p>Costs for osteopathic office visits are similar to those of allopathic 
physicians, but overall cost for osteopathic treatments may be less than for 
allopathic treatments. Costs in rural areas are lower than those in urban 
centers.</p> 
<p>The best way to evaluate the results of osteopathic care is by a subjective 
response - the patient feels better. However, there are some objective criteria 
such as increased range of motion, lab tests, spinal palpation, and changes in 
craniosacral motion and pulse.</p>

<h2>Therapies Involving Nature</h2> 
<p>This category is divided into two sections:</p> 
<ol> 
<li>naturopathic and herbal remedies</li> 
<li>homeopathic remedies</li> </ol> 
<p>To some extent, the alternative therapies covered so far fall into the 
broad category of &quot;naturopathic&quot; medicine because they are aimed at 
helping the body to heal itself using natural substances and processes.</p> 
<h3>Naturopathic Medicine</h3> 
<p>There are two broad categories of naturopathic medicine. The first is the 
vitalistic approach, which emphasizes the body's natural healing powers, 
insists on lifestyle changes, hydrotherapy, and stress reduction techniques to 
prevent and treat illnesses. Only if these methods fail are herbs and other 
chemical interventions tried.</p> 
<p>The second category, the biochemical approach, uses herbs and nutritional 
substances, such as vitamins, as the first line of treatment. This approach is 
more symptom-oriented than the vitalistic approach. This second category is 
more in line with the views of allopathic medicine, and more easily studied 
using Western scientific research methods. It is more commonly practiced in 
this culture than the vitalistic method.</p> 
<p>Naturopaths are trained as primary care providers in a variety of 
intervention techniques, and may specialize in any of them, or choose to 
specialize in specific problem areas, such as allergy or arthritis.</p> 
<p>There is more support in some cases for the use of naturopathic 
interventions than for some pharmaceutical and surgical interventions we now 
take for granted. In some cases &quot;new&quot; remedies in allopathic medicine 
have been used for years by naturopaths. For example, naturopaths have been 
using vitamin E for its antioxidant properties for over thirty years. As the 
demand for nontoxic remedies for serious illnesses increases, naturopathic 
research is receiving more attention from mainstream medicine; allopathic 
researchers are beginning to research naturopathic remedies, thus providing the 
scientific data necessary to legitimize naturopathic medicine in the minds of 
those trained in Western medical thought.</p> 
<p>The strength of naturopathic medicine lies in its ability to prevent 
illness and to treat illnesses that haven't responded well to conventional 
medical therapies. Naturopaths excel in the clinical use of nutrition regimens 
because of their vast knowledge of the latest research in nutritional medicine. 
They see themselves as part of a comprehensive system of health care that 
includes many other traditions with valid intervention that can be used 
alongside naturopathy. They evaluate their results by the subjective responses 
of the patient, their own observations, the reduction of symptoms, and the 
results of any lab tests administered.</p> 
<p>Appropriate nursing diagnoses for referral to a naturopath include the 
following because they are often responsive to nutritional remedies:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>altered nutrition, both less than and more than, body requirement</li> 
<li>chronic constipation or diarrhea</li> 
<li>nutritional knowledge deficit</li> 
<li>sleep pattern disturbance</li> 
<li>stress syndrome</li> </ul> 
<p>Many studies on the development and treatment of various cancers are 
supporting the importance of diet, and other lifestyle issues.</p> 
<p>Garlic has been shown, in some animal studies, to have cancer-suppressing 
potential by inhibiting the metabolism of carcinogens in the body, and by 
stopping them from binding to genetic material. This is true not just for 
breast cancer, but for other forms of cancer as well, such as liver, lung, and 
colon cancers. Other researchers say that it is difficult to study the effects 
of garlic because the same properties that are suspected of producing 
anti-carcinogenic effects are also the properties that cause its distinctive 
odor. There are no adequate odorless stand-ins for fresh cloves, and the amount 
of garlic needed to provide definitive answers (often as much as 7-28 cloves a 
day) is prohibitive, given the odor problems associated with it. More research 
is needed before definitive dietary conclusions can be made.</p> 
<p>Scientists are also starting to realize the anti-carcinogenic properties of 
compounds called polyphenols. They are found in fresh fruits and vegetables, 
and in many grains. Anyone eating a standard healthy diet is exposed to them 
regularly. They generally come from plant foods, and are manufactured by the 
plant to protect itself against ultraviolet light, oxidation, and insects.</p> 
<p>It is believed that these anti- carcinogenic properties may be transferred 
to humans when they consume these plants. The major antioxidant vitamins are A 
(beta-carotene found in a wide variety of fruits and vegetables), C (ascorbic 
acid), and E (tocopherol). They have the distinct advantage of having few side 
effects when taken in a wide range of supplemental doses and are ideal for use 
as preventive agents in healthy populations.</p> 
<p>Recent studies have shown that antioxidants may play a role in reducing the 
risk of cataracts, age-related macular degeneration, certain neurological 
disturbances, bladder cancer recurrence, and infectious diseases. However, 
despite the number of studies showing the benefits of antioxidant 
supplementation, consensus about these benefits still does not exist. 
Researchers are calling for longer and more substantial clinical trials before 
definitive results can be obtained.</p> 
<p>For years scientists have suspected that fish oils provide protection 
against certain types of cancers such as breast and prostate. The omega-3 fatty 
acids found in fish oils have been a prime target of cancer research in recent 
years because researchers have observed that the same parts of the world where 
breast cancer rates are high are where prostate cancer rates are high. 
Parallels in terms of diet (diets in these countries are high in fat), hormonal 
dependence, and biological behavior have been found. Because research has shown 
a correlation between the development of breast cancer and the intake of 
omega-6 fatty acids (found mostly in polyunsaturated oils), current research is 
looking for a correlation between omega-6 fatty acids and prostate cancer.</p> 
<p>Soy products such as soy flour, soy milk, and tofu contain phytoestrogen 
compounds that appear to not only aid in symptoms of menopause, but may also 
prevent certain types of cancer such as breast and prostate. It appears, 
however, that it is difficult to get all that is needed for cancer prevention 
simply from diet. Therefore, many researchers are excited by a new 
supplementation product known as genistein, an isoflavone phytoestrogen found 
naturally in soybeans. Because its chemical structure is similar to estrogen, 
but its hormonal action is considerably less than that of the body's naturally 
produced estrogens, it is theorized that genistein may be useful in preventing 
cancers of several different organs by binding with estrogen receptor sites and 
preventing the stronger estrogens from binding, thus reducing overall hormonal 
activity. Genistein may also cause cancer cells to mature, differentiate, and 
die as normal cells do, which kills the cancer cells. Soy isoflavones may 
encourage bone density in postmenopausal women by binding to an estrogen 
receptor found in bones, thereby preventing osteoporosis. More studies are 
called for to reproduce these findings.</p> 
<p>The complexity of factors which lead to cardiovascular risk, make 
cardiovascular wellness and prevention a good candidate for holistic 
interventions. The use of antioxidants to prevent and treat heart disease has 
been an important part of research from earlier findings suggesting that the 
oxidation of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol is critical in the development 
of arteriosclerosis.</p> 
<p>The mechanism by which antioxidants may prevent the development of 
cardiovascular disease is not fully understood. They may work on the LDL/HDL 
ratio; affect the blood coagulation system, making thrombosis unlikely; or 
prevent the oxidation of the arterial walls. To complicate matters further, it 
may be that each of these possible mechanisms is linked to a specific 
antioxidant.</p> 
<p>Not surprisingly, it appears that fats play a role in the development of 
cardiovascular disease as well as cancer. A Norwegian study demonstrated that 
fish oils lower both diastolic and systolic blood pressures, decrease serum 
triglyceride levels, and decrease serum lipid levels in persons with untreated 
hypertension. Another study found that when fish-oil supplementation is 
combined with garlic supplementation, serum cholesterol levels drop and the 
LDL/HDL ratio is improved.</p> 
<p>Often powerful drugs with unpleasant side-effects are the allopathic means 
of treating hypercholesterolemia. Those who think in holistic terms believe 
these drugs should not be the first choice in the treatment of high 
cholesterol, but should be used only after efforts at lifestyle and dietary 
changes have failed. Such changes entail regular exercise, a reduction of 
dietary saturated fatty acids and cholesterol, and possibly moderate alcohol 
intake (to change LDL/HDL ratio). Often dietary supplements with lipid-lowering 
effects are given as well. Soy proteins are one such supplement shown to be as 
effective as pharmacological treatments, without the troubling side effects.</p>
<p>Another advantage to soy is that the higher the beginning cholesterol 
level, the greater the lipid-reducing effect it has, which suggests that it 
should, at least, be used in conjunction with allopathic drugs when a patient 
has dangerously high cholesterol levels. The mechanism by which these 
supplements work is believed to be connected to the isoflavone component of the 
soy protein. Isoflavones are an example of a group of compounds called 
phytoestrogens, which exert mild hormonal effects on the body. It is theorized 
that the isoflavones found in soy proteins affect the body in a metabolically 
and hormonally complex way to lower cholesterol levels, and may reduce the 
rates of some cancers by slowing cell replication.</p> 
<p>Soy supplements are an important part of a holistic approach to heart 
disease. The dietary changes needed to lower cholesterol are often difficult 
for patients to maintain because they require a vigilance that some don't think 
they have the time for, find too expensive, or deem inconvenient. Whatever the 
reason, if one is unable to comply with the rigid diet recommended, it does 
little to improve their overall health. Soy supplementation may be an answer 
for many because it lowers overall cholesterol levels, even in the patient who 
is not maintaining the strict dietary regimen prescribed.</p>

<p>Orthomolecular medicine (often known as megavitamin therapy) is another 
complementary regimen based on nutrition. The main principle underlying this 
form of medicine is that people are biochemical individuals with their own 
special bodily needs and, therefore, RDA vitamin and supplement requirements 
make little sense as nutrient guides. Instead, the patient's progress is 
monitored through regular blood work and urinalysis. This system eliminates 
junk food, refined sugar, and food additives from the diet while prescribing 
large doses of specific vitamins. Most practitioners are aware of the danger of 
toxicity with some vitamins and carefully watch for symptoms. This form of 
complementary care is used in cancer prevention; prevention of neural tube 
defects (by folic acid supplementation); and the treatment of diabetes, 
hypoglycemia, and arthritis.</p>

<p>A cure for the common cold has eluded researchers for decades and, while 
zinc does not technically qualify as a cure, there is some evidence to support 
the claim that zinc lozenges can reduce the aggravating symptoms of the common 
cold, and reduce the duration of symptoms.</p> 
<p>A study showed those taking zinc lozenges had symptoms for 4.4 days, while 
those who took placebos had symptoms for 7.6 days. The patients who took the 
lozenges reported significantly less coughing, headache, hoarseness, nasal 
congestion, and drainage than did the placebo group. However, no difference was 
found in fevers, muscle aches, or sneezing.</p> 
<p>Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) is a fairly new phenomenon that has not been 
amenable to allopathic treat ment methods.</p> 
<p>The Center for Disease Control (CDC) defines chronic fatigue syndrome as 
unexplained fatigue lasting for six months resulting in substantial reduction 
of activities, plus at least four of the following symptoms: impaired 
short-term memory, difficulty concentrating, sore throat, tender lymph nodes, 
muscle pains, joint pains without swelling or redness, headaches of a type or 
severity not previously experienced, lack of sleep, and malaise of more than 
one day following exercise.</p> 
<p>CFS strikes primarily women between the ages of 25 and 45, and usually 
occurs suddenly. It can last for years, but sufferers often do not look sick, 
and may be labeled as lazy or mentally unstable. There is no known cause or lab 
test to diagnose CFS, but researchers are looking into the possibility that 
stress causes the immune system dysfunction, viral infection, environmental 
assault, and neuroendocrine imbalances associated with CFS. The latest thinking 
is that the cluster of symptoms is caused by a combination of these factors.</p>
<p>Pharmaceutical intervention is mildly helpful in treating CFS, and includes 
the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents for joint pain and low doses of 
antidepressants to reset disturbed sleep patterns. Some herbs that may help are:
</p> 
<ol> 
<li>the Chinese herb astralagus for its antiviral and immunity-enhancing 
properties. It can be found in health food stores.</li> 
<li>Maitake, from a wild Japanese mushroom, has antiviral and immunity 
enhancing properties.</li> 
<li>Cordyceps may increase physical, sexual, and mental stamina. It can be 
added to soups or taken as tea.</li> 
<li>Garlic for its antibacterial and antiviral effects.</li> </ol> 
<p>Homeopathic remedies may help CFS, but because everyone is different, and 
there is a wide array of symptoms associated with the syndrome, it is strongly 
suggested that one should consult a trained homeopathic practitioner rather 
than attempt to self-medicate with homeopathic agents.</p> 
<p>Cognitive therapy and/or support group therapy may help, as long as the 
practitioner and/or group members maintain a positive attitude. These can be 
sources for information, and to learn to cope with distressing thoughts and 
feelings. Relaxation techniques can be taught in these settings.</p> 
<p>Health food stores and alternative medicine literature contain many newer 
supplementation materials and information that is impossible to cover in an 
overview course such as this one. However, a few of the more common ones, many 
of which are actually hormones, will be highlighted.</p> 
<p>DHEA, a hormone produced by the adrenal gland that reaches its peak at 
about the age of 30 and drops significantly by age 60, has been reported to 
cure aging, promote weight loss, prevent heart disease and Alzheimer's disease, 
combat AIDS, cure lupus, and even serve as a remedy for some cancers. There is 
not enough clinical evidence to support these claims, but there is much 
scientific interest in DHEA because of the way it naturally functions in the 
body. Since it is associated with youth and vitality, it is natural to wonder 
if replacing it as one gets older would retard the aging process. Most claims 
are based on animal and lab studies, and the few that have been conducted on 
humans have been inconclusive.</p> 
<p>Other hormones that decrease as aging occurs include human growth hormone, 
estrogen, testosterone, and melatonin. Human growth hormone declines gradually 
after middle age. When replaced, it can have dramatic effects on the body's 
metabolic rates and change the muscle/fat ratio, accelerate the healing process 
in surgical patients, and help people sleep better.</p> 
<p>Estrogen begins its decline in women around age 40 and sharply drops off 
about age 50. Replacement can reduce or eliminate hot flashes and insomnia, two 
of the major annoyances women going through menopause complain about. It is 
believed to reduce the risk of heart disease and osteoporosis in postmenopausal 
women. This is extremely important because studies have shown that although 
women are, for the most part, protected against heart disease until menopause 
occurs, once estrogen levels drop dramatically, women have the same risk as men 
for developing heart disease. The major difference is that when women have MIs 
after menopause, they are usually more severe than the first heart attacks of 
men, and women are more likely to die from the first attack than men are. Men 
may get a warning, but women often do not.</p> 
<p>Melatonin is a hormone produced in the pineal gland from serotonin (5-HT) 
levels. It has serum levels that change on a circadian rhythm pattern, with 
higher levels present at night, and lower levels present during the day. Its 
overall body levels decrease sharply at adolescence, and again at age 40. The 
elderly produce about half of that produced by children. Replacement may ease 
insomnia, relieve symptoms of jet lag, strengthen the immune system, fight 
certain cancers, act as an antioxidant, relieve some symptoms of seasonal 
affective disorder, and prevent ovulation. It can have a side effect of daytime 
grogginess and exacerbate any tendencies toward depression. The FDA does not 
approve it because it is classified as a dietary supplement instead of a drug, 
so it cannot be obtained by prescription, but may be commercially available in 
health food stores. It is found in both a synthetic and non-synthetic form, but 
use of the non-synthetic form is discouraged because of the risk of 
contamination or viral transmission. It is suggested that patients seek medical 
advice before taking melatonin.</p> 
<p>There are many herbal remedies that are used by a variety of alternative 
practitioners.</p> 
<p>The following will focus on a few of the most utilized herbal interventions.
</p> 
<p><strong>Garlic</strong> is probably the most recognized medicinal herb 
among researchers. Its chemistry and pharmacology are well studied. It is well 
known for its antibiotic, antifungal, antiviral, and anti-carcinogenic 
properties. It also clears congestion, kills intestinal worms, improves immune 
system functioning, and lowers blood pressure.</p> 
<p><strong>Ginger</strong> is known for its aid in digestion, its anti-nausea, 
and its anti-motion sickness properties. It is currently being studied as a 
source of migraine relief.</p> 
<p><strong>Feverfew</strong> is an herb that has been researched and proven 
effective against migraines, and prevents the onset of future episodes.</p> 
<p><strong>Ginkgo biloba</strong> is an extract from the leaves of the ginkgo 
tree and is popular in Europe where it is usually sold in 40mg tablets. 
Evidence suggests that in large doses, it dilates blood vessels, increasing 
circulation throughout the body and improving memory and concentration. It may 
act as an antioxidant, useful in treating chronic hypertension, and aid in the 
reduction of serum cholesterol. In Germany it is used for tinnitus, headaches, 
and emotional instability. Its major side effects, which occur at very high 
doses, include nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.</p> 
<p><strong>Echinacea</strong> is sold in liquid and capsule form, and is taken 
orally. Several studies have demonstrated its multiple effects on the immune 
system. It elevates WBC, improves the efficiency of macrophages and proteins 
designed to regulate disease-fighting cells, and may alleviate cold and flu 
symptoms. It has few side effects, except for those who are allergic to it.</p> 
<p><strong>Ginseng</strong> is from an Asian class of drugs that interact with 
neurotransmitters and can alleviate stress. It is used to reduce hot flashes in 
menopausal women, but has been found to be more effective if taken with vitamin 
E. Recent studies suggest that it may be useful as adjunct therapy in treating 
newly diagnosed non-insulin dependent diabetes, and as an antioxidant. Side 
effects, such as nausea and insomnia, are few and usually occur at very high 
doses. However, there is some evidence that ginseng may interfere with other 
pharmacologic agents such as digoxin. Health professionals should be aware of 
this danger. When obtaining a patient's history, to be alert for medications 
the patient is taking, including herbal remedies. Claims that ginseng acts as 
an aphrodisiac do not have supporting evidence.</p> 
<p><strong>Dong quai</strong> is used to relieve menstrual cramps, symptoms of 
menopause, and other gynecological problems. It appears to work by dilating the 
blood vessels and preventing vessel spasms. There is no clinical evidence to 
support these claims. Dong quai's main side effect is to increase the skin's 
sensitivity to the sun, and it should never be taken in high doses.</p> 
<p><strong>Black cohosh</strong> is a powder usually sold in capsule form, or 
as an herbal tea, and derived from a plant commonly known as rattleweed. It 
dilates blood vessels, and lab studies have revealed that it contains several 
compounds that bind to estrogen receptors. It is widely used in Europe to 
relieve the symptoms of PMS and menopause. An overdose can cause dizziness and 
headaches. Safety during pregnancy has not been established.</p> 
<p>Other herbs that may have estrogenic properties and help reduce hot flashes 
are<strong>blue cohosh, fennel, false unicorn root, red clover, sarsaparilla, 
unicorn root, wild yam root, and oil of primrose</strong>. It is important to 
remember that herbs with estrogenic properties may be dangerous for women who 
have been advised against taking estrogen, either as a hormone replacement in 
menopause, or in birth control pills. The nurse should provide this information 
to a client inquiring about the use of these herbs.</p> 
<p>It is true that some herbs with estrogenic properties also have 
anti-estrogenic properties. Some theorize that these herbs can protect against 
certain estrogen-related cancers as they provide relief for the 
estrogen-dependent symptoms of menopause. This has not been proven, however, 
and one taking these herbs should know of the potential dangers, as well as 
their benefits. Together, the client and doctor can make the best choice for 
individual symptoms and risk factors.</p> 
<p><strong>Tea-tree oil</strong> is pressed from the leaves of a tropical tree 
and has been used for centuries as a topical antiseptic by those living in the 
South Sea Islands. Its principle active ingredient is terpinen-4-ol, which acts 
as a bactericidal substance. Some clinical studies have indicated that it may 
be effective in treating acne and other skin infections, as well as vaginal 
infections. There seem to be few side effects.</p> 
<p>Herbs and teas that may produce a calming effect on the nervous system and 
help reduce anxiety, irritability, and insomnia are<strong>chamomile, catnip, 
hops, valerian root, peppermint, and passionflower</strong>.</p> 
<p>Other herbs that may target specific problems include milk thistle used to 
treat liver conditions, such as cirrhosis and jaundice; saw palmetto used to 
treat prostate enlargement; and valerian used as a minor tranquilizer and sleep 
aid. Valerian does not seem to interact with alcohol or have a side effect of 
morning grogginess as other sedatives do. Cayenne pepper can stimulate blood 
flow, strengthen the heart and metabolic rate, and aid in digestion. 
Chasteberry can restore a normal estrogen/progesterone balance within the body. 
Goldenseal has antimicrobial and antibacterial effects. Licorice is used for 
gastritis and bronchitis, nettle for arthritis and rheumatism and its possible 
effects against hay fever, senna for constipation, and witch hazel to soothe 
hemorrhoids and to stop diarrhea.</p> 
<p><strong>St. John's Wort</strong> is a remedy used for nearly two thousand 
years for its anti-inflammatory effects, and sedative and pain reducing 
properties. It is also good for anxiety, tension, neuralgia, and the 
irritability symptoms of menopause. It is also used as an antidepressant, and 
an antiviral in conditions ranging from the common cold to HIV.</p> 
<p>It is important for nurses to remember that allopathic medicine does not 
have all the answers to important health questions, and much can be learned 
from the wide variety of complementary approaches described in this course. 
Unfortunately, there are people who will take advantage of the lack of controls 
over many of these alternative substances, and use them in harmful ways to make 
a quick buck or use them in excess; more is not always better.</p> 
<p>Commercially available preparations vary as to dosages, so patients should 
be warned about the possibility of problems if they change brands. Exceeding 
the recommended dosage can lead to toxicity, just as it can with allopathic 
medicines. Patients should be counseled to report symptoms such as diarrhea, 
rash, urticaria, or gastrointestinal upset to their healthcare provider.</p> 
<p>The role of the nurse is to be informed about alternative and complementary 
approaches, and to help patients weed through the vast amount of information 
about these substances so that optimum health care can be achieved, with as 
little risk as possible. Therefore, nurses should ask why the patient is taking 
the herb, how much, what brand, and who suggested its use. If the patient is 
pregnant, the nurse should discourage further use until the patient has 
consulted with her allopathic primary caregiver, just as one should with any 
drug.</p> 
<p>The public perception of the FDA as a slow-moving bureaucracy that prevents 
the latest &quot;cures&quot; from being marketed may have some truth to it. 
Some suggest that the FDA has biases against dietary supplements because of its 
relationship with large pharmaceutical companies, implying an element of 
corruption within the FDA itself. Patients must be reminded that the regulatory 
benefits of an agency such as the FDA can prevent disasters like the 
thalidomide tragedy of the 1950's from occurring. On a less dramatic note, the 
FDA's requirements of consistent dosages protect people from suffering 
unnecessary side effects when they switch brands of a product. In an age of 
rapidly expanding knowledge about health care and the ability to disseminate 
that information quickly and widely, a regulatory agency such as the FDA 
definitely has its positive and negative qualities.</p>

<h3>Homeopathy</h3> 
<p>Homeopathy is a system of medicine based on the use of natural substances 
to stimulate the body's own healing powers in curing disease. Because 
homeopathy uses natural substances, it is considered to be a subspecialty of 
naturopathic medicine. However, the theory behind it is different.</p> 
<p>Homeopathy made its debut in this country around the turn of the century 
and was popular for many years but, like many other fields of complementary 
medicine, it began to decline as the interest in allopathic medicine rose. 
Interestingly, it was a homeopathic physician who was instrumental in the 
formation of the FDA. In recent years, as the limitations of allopathic 
medicine have become more apparent to the public, interest in homeopathic 
remedies has skyrocketed.</p> 
<p>Homeopathic roots go back as far as Hippocrates' &quot;law of the 
similars&quot; which in medical terms can be stated as &quot;like cures 
like.&quot; In practical terms, this means that often a substance that causes a 
set of symptoms in a healthy individual will have the opposite effect (a cure) 
on an ill person with similar symptoms. Vaccinations and allergy treatments of 
allopathic medicine share much the same principle. Unlike homeopathy, however, 
a standard treatment and dosage is given to all patients, whereas homeopathy 
strives to find the perfect dose and combination of remedies for each 
individual.</p> 
<p>Like many complementary practices, this one believes that human beings are 
enlivened by a &quot;vital force&quot; or energy that can be an indicator of 
the presence of illness. Homeopaths use the energy of one substance (the 
remedy) to heal the energy field of another substance (the ill person) by 
arousing this energy field so that it actually heals itself. The remedies are 
not chosen to support the body's nutritional or metabolic needs, or to attack 
viruses and other pathogens that may be attacking the body as occurs in 
allopathic medicine but, instead, to subtly urge the body's vital force into a 
higher level of functioning to eliminate symptoms and their cause.</p> 
<p>Homeopathy views symptoms as defense mechanisms by which the body tries to 
rid itself of harmful stresses. These symptoms, and their remedies, are studied 
in different ways from other forms of medicine. They are not described 
pharmacologically, or in terms of action, but rather the effects of the 
remedies are derived from three sources:</p> 
<ol> 
<li>Homeopathic drug &quot;provings&quot; in healthy people are experiments 
where a substance is administered over a specific period of time to healthy 
volunteers to cause the symptoms that they produce. Then the obvious changes in 
the body or psyche are meticulously recorded, such as intensity of symptoms, 
variations with time of day, and modifying influences of circumstances and 
environment. These studies are subject to the same legal restrictions as 
pharmacological studies in that they require detailed protocols, informed 
consent, and the approval of an ethics committee.</li> 
<li>Toxicological studies are a cruder form and they often show the potential 
spectrum of an action of a particular remedy without the subtleties in symptom 
gradation that would be seen clinically.</li> 
<li>Therapeutic experience occurs when the remedy is used clinically and 
therefore, a crucial part of the test of the efficacy of a treatment.</li> </ol>
<p>Homeopathy treats the unique compilation of symptoms of an individual by 
paying attention to those symptoms, which may differ from someone else with the 
same diagnosis. To illustrate this point, several patients with migraine 
headaches would be given several different treatment regimens to follow, 
depending on whether the pain is localized on the right side of the head, or 
the left, whether the migraines are associated with hormonal changes of the 
menstrual cycle or menopause, or whether they are triggered by certain foods 
and/or emotions. The diagnosis of migraine headache is not what leads to the 
remedy, but rather the unique way that the migraines are expressed from one 
individual to another is what determines treatment choices.</p> 
<p>The nearly three thousand homeopathic remedies (of which 200-300 are used 
frequently) come from nature in the form of herbs, minerals, and are some 
animal products, and are regulated by the FDA and sold as over-the-counter 
medications. They take the form of small sublingual tablets and are prepared by 
a process known as &quot;potentization&quot; in which they are constantly 
diluted until only a very small amount remains. The theory behind this practice 
states that the more diluted a remedy is, the longer it will act, the more 
effective it will be, and the fewer the side effects it will produce. The 
mechanism of action of these extremely dilute substances is not well understood.
</p> 
<p>Homeopathic remedies are divided into three categories - acute, chronic, 
and constitutional. Acute remedies are given for short- term illness, such as 
the flu or the common cold, while chronic remedies are given for long - term 
conditions. Chronic remedies may take a few months to a couple of years to be 
effective in reducing symptoms. Once the person has recovered from the 
precipitating symptoms, a constitutional remedy may be given to increase the 
body's resistance to developing future symptoms. Constitutional remedies work 
slowly over time to strengthen the body against further disease.</p> 
<p>An ideal remedy is matched to this set of symptoms, which would create the 
same symptoms if given to a healthy person. The result is a total body response 
which causes the person to function better. The symptoms are viewed as the 
body's attempt to restore homeostasis to a body in distress; the treatment is 
designed to promote the power of the total body to heal itself. Symptoms that, 
at first glance, may appear to be unrelated are treated together as though they 
are related, so the patient can heal on all levels - physically, emotionally 
and spiritually.</p> 
<p>As stated before concerning migraine headaches, treatments selected are 
unique to the individual so that two people with the same disease may be 
manifesting symptoms in different ways. The homeopath treats the symptoms 
rather than the disease itself, and believes that the whole person is healed in 
a way that is foreign to the thinking of allopathic medicine. Unlike the 
allopathic physician, the homeopath does not need to diagnose a particular 
disease to treat the patient. Some homeopaths suggest that modern 
pharmaceutical preparations can impede the body's own healing mechanism by 
masking symptoms instead of curing the underlying disease. Homeopaths believe 
modern allopathic treatment methods can weaken the body's vital force. They 
stress the importance of focusing on strengthening the vital force instead of 
searching for offending pathogens.</p> 
<p>In homeopathic theory it is believed that faster the onset of symptoms, the 
faster the cure; therefore, acute illnesses are easier to treat than chronic 
ones. When several symptoms are involved, the minor ones disappear before the 
major ones do. Often, a short time after administering the remedy, the 
patient's symptoms may worsen for a time. This is considered normal in 
homeopathic practice and is a sign that the body is being spurred on to greater 
levels of healing. Frequently, emotional healing occurs before the abatement of 
physical symptoms.</p> 
<p>Homeopathy is most effective in the early stages of acute and long-term 
illnesses before enough time has passed to cause tissue damage. It is good in 
treating headaches (including migraines), immune system conditions, auto-immune 
disorders, viral and bacterial infections, childhood health problems such as 
chronic ear infections, croup, bladder infections, emotional and behavioral 
problems, and even learning disabilities. Some researchers are less impressed 
with the success of homeopathy against these childhood diseases than are other 
researchers, so exercise caution in referring these patients to a homeopathic 
practitioner. Homeopathy has shown effectiveness against the herpes virus. A 
major advantage homeopathy has over conventional medicine is it uses substances 
in such small amounts to effect a cure, that there are virtually no side 
effects.</p> 
<p>Nursing diagnoses for referral to a homeopath might be an appropriate 
intervention include: activity intolerance or high risk for activity 
intolerance, constipation, diarrhea, fatigue, altered health maintenance, high 
risk for infection, altered nutrition patterns - less than or more than body 
requirement, and altered urinary elimination patterns.</p> 
<p>Like most alternative therapies, there is a long initial interview in which 
the practitioner/patient relationship is established. Unlike most alternative 
traditions, practitioners of homeopathy do not consider the relationship the 
most important part of the healing process but, instead, attribute most of the 
effectiveness of the approach to the remedies themselves and the diagnostic 
skills of the practitioners. The patient's subjective report of symptom 
reduction is the major criterion upon which this approach is evaluated.</p> 
<p>Homeopathic practitioners tend to be less concerned with the other 
alternative therapies covered in this course because they administer physical 
remedies similar to the medications of allopathic medicine and, therefore, 
believe that relief of symptoms comes from their choice of the right remedy. 
They have little interest in bodywork, herbal and nutritional medicine, or 
mind/body techniques.</p> 
<p>Patients should be encouraged to look into the training background of a 
homeopath they are considering. The Council on Homeopathic Education has a list 
of several accredited programs. Their website is www.chedu.org. Naturopathic 
homeopaths are believed to be better equipped than some MDs for the practice of 
homeopathy because they have often undergone specialization in homeopathy as 
part of their elective training. Such a specialization is not readily available 
in most Western medical schools.</p> 
<h2>Other Forms of Alternative Medicine</h2> 
<p>It is not feasible to provide detailed information on every alternative 
approach available, but it is important to briefly cover some of them.</p> 
<h3>Essential Oils and Aromatherapy</h3> 
<p>The term &quot;aromatherapy&quot; was coined in 1928 by French chemist 
Rene-Maurice Gattefoss,. His interest in using essential oils therapeutically 
was stimulated by a laboratory explosion in his family's perfumery business, in 
which his hand was severely burned. He plunged the injured hand into a 
container of lavender oil and was amazed at how quickly it healed. By the 
1960s, a few people, including the French doctor Jean Valnet and the 
Austrian-born biochemist Madame Marguerite Maury, were inspired by Gattefoss,'s 
work. As an army surgeon in World War II, Dr. Valnet used essential oils such 
as thyme, clove, lemon and chamomile on wounds and burns, and later found 
fragrances successful in treating psychiatric problems. But while Valnet helped 
inspire a modern aromatherapy movement when his book Aromatherapie was 
translated into English as The Practice of Aromatherapy, it was the appearance 
in 1977 of masseur Robert Tisserand's book The Art of Aromatherapy, strongly 
influenced by the work of Valnet and Gattefoss, that was successful in 
capturing American interest. At present, there are many books available on 
aromatherapy.</p> 
<p>Most important, the efforts of pioneers like Valnet, Maury and Tisserand 
have turned aromatherapy into a disciplined healing art, rediscovering the uses 
of fragrance from ancient times and sparking a revival of aromatherapy that has 
swept throughout the world.</p> 
<p>Aromatherapy uses the essential oils extracted from plants and herbs to 
treat bacterial and viral infections, skin disorders, stress, herpes simplex, 
herpes zoster and immune deficiencies. The oils are believed to act on the 
adrenal glands, ovaries, and the thyroid by traveling from the nose to the 
limbic system, which controls heart rate, blood pressure, breathing patterns, 
memory, stress levels, and hormone balance. They work by invoking pleasant 
emotional reactions stored in the brain from previous experiences with a 
particular aroma. The main oils used are:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>eucalyptus as an expectoral agent</li> 
<li>everlast as an anti-inflammatory</li> 
<li>geranium as an antifungal agent</li> 
<li>lavender for burns and insect bites, and stress</li> 
<li>mandarin and/or chamomile to reduce anxiety</li> 
<li>peppermint for nausea and reduction of the symptoms associated with 
irritable bowel syndrome</li> 
<li>palmarosa for herpes.</li> 
<li>spearmint (dot oil lightly on temples) for headache relief</li> </ul> 
<p>Some of these essential oils are applied topically, and others breathed in. 
It is extremely important for patients to know that the method of application 
is essential for maximum benefit from the oil, and to prevent toxic reactions 
that can occur with some substances if they are not applied properly. For more 
information on aromatherapy, contact the National Association for Holistic 
Aromatherapy in Seattle, Washington (888-ASK-NAHA or visitwww.naha.org ) or

<h3>Detoxification Therapy</h3> 
<p> Detoxification therapy is rapidly becoming popular as more people 
recognize that they may not feel their best because of their body's exposure to 
toxic substances as a result of our modern lifestyle. Detoxification therapy 
rids the body of these toxins to improve the immune function, reduce 
neurotoxicity and hormonal dysfunction, decrease psychological problems, and 
even eliminate cancer cells. Detoxification usually takes the form of fasting 
or strict diet regimens, colonic irrigation, and/or hyperthermia. These 
processes can be hard on the body and are not recommended for recovering drug 
addicts, alcoholics, diabetics, or those with eating disorders without strict 
medical supervision. It is also not recommended for the physically weak, the 
underweight, or for those with hypothyroid or hypoglycemic conditions. For more 
information, contact the American Association of Naturopathic Physicians in 
Seattle, Washington at 866-538-2267 or www.naturopathic.org.</p> 
<h3>Environmental Medicine</h3> 
<p>Environmental medicine explores the role of dietary and environmental 
allergens such as dust, mold, chemicals, and foods in promoting health and 
illness. These environmental substances, including food, may affect any of the 
body's many systems, thus contributing to many forms of illness.</p> 
<p>A variety of tests are used to determine particular problem substances for 
an individual. Examples are elimination diet, skin testing, blood tests, 
electro acupuncture, biofeedback, and thyroid functioning. It is useful in 
treating mold, pollen, and food allergies, and rheumatoid arthritis.</p>

Medicine in Wichita, Kansas at 316-684-5500 orwww.aaem.com.</p> 
<h3>Enzyme Therapy</h3> 
<p>Enzyme therapy is used to treat digestive problems from an individual's 
lack of an enzyme or the proper amount of the enzyme needed for healthy 
digestion to occur. Enzyme supplementation, along with a diet consisting of 
whole, and whenever possible, raw foods, helps ensure that the proper nutrients 
are absorbed to restore the body to a fully functioning capacity. Cooking kills 
many of the plant enzymes needed for proper stomach digestion. Pancreatic 
enzymes, derived from animals, are used to aid intestinal digestion. Enzyme 
therapy is useful in treating inflammation, viruses, multiple sclerosis, and 
cancers.</p> 
<h3>Oxygen Therapies</h3> 
<p>Oxygen therapies alter the body's chemistry to help overcome disease, 
promote healing, and improve overall body function. They are effective against 
viral, fungal, parasitic, and bacterial infections, as well as circulatory 
irregularities, chronic fatigue syndrome, arthritis, allergies, cancer, and 
multiple sclerosis. They include:</p> 
<ol> 
<li>oxygenation therapies, such as hyperbaric oxygen therapy which is done in 
a sealed pressurized tube and allows a person to take in higher concentrations 
of oxygen than could be done normally. This is primarily used for trauma 
victims.</li> 
<li>oxidation therapies are used to selectively kill pathogens and must be 
administered under controlled clinical conditions. They include hydrogen 
peroxide therapy for wound and tissue repair, and ozone therapy for chronic 
viral infections. For more information, contact: the American College of 
Hyperbaric Medicine, Lauderdale-by-the-Sea, Florida.</li> </ol> 
<p>There is a variety of complementary and alternative health care practices 
and traditions that are quickly assimilated into modern Western medical 
tradition as more Western-trained health care professionals recognize the 
benefits of these methods, and become trained in them. As the cost of health 
care skyrockets, the less expensive complementary methods are looking 
increasingly attractive to both the public and to health care professionals.</p>
<p>The role of the nurse is rapidly changing as the emphasis on holistic 
health increases, because nurses have traditionally been taught to look at the 
whole patient and to care for the spiritual, psychosocial, physical and 
emotional aspects of their patients. The holistic approach of most of the 
complementary practices naturally lends itself to nursing functions.</p> 
<p>Naturopathic medicine, with its emphasis on diet and supplements, is 
naturally attractive to most nurses. Nurses have an important role to play in 
educating the public about the role of diet and supplementation to maintain 
optimal health, and to fight the disease process once it has started. Because 
of the holistic approach to health, nurses are becoming increasingly involved 
in mind/body medicine in a variety of ways by making appropriate nursing 
diagnoses, and intervening with appropriate nursing interventions. These 
interventions include teaching relaxation and meditation techniques to reduce 
stress, facilitating support groups to encourage psychosocial development, and 
using therapeutic touch and prayer, when requested, to meet the spiritual needs 
of their patient. Some nurses are trained in massage therapy to better serve 
their clients' holistic health care needs for comforting touch.</p> 
<p>In other areas of complementary medicine the role of the nurse is to be 
informed on the subject to better serve patients by providing information about 
the advantages and disadvantages of these approaches, and to make referrals to 
the appropriate practitioners. These areas include Traditional Chinese Medicine 
(both herbal and acupuncture), other popular forms of herbal medicine 
distributed by naturopaths, chiropractic medicine, osteopathic medicine, and 
homeopathic medicine.</p> 
<p>As we move further into the twenty-first century, it is an exciting time to 
be a nurse because of the new techniques and theories of medicine. Nurses can 
play a key role in disseminating this information to an increasingly 
sophisticated public. As hospital census numbers decrease throughout the 
country, more nurses are finding employment in other environments such as home 
health, industries, and entrepreneurial ventures of their own. This helps to 
place the nurse in a position to teach not just sick people, but the healthy, 
too, by providing important preventive information to obtain an optimum state 
of health. This not only improves quality of life, but also helps to reduce the 
astronomical costs of health care. Today's nurse is an integral part of the 
modern health care delivery system, and provides a positive influence.</p>
