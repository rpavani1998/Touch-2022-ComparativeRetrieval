unscientific into the medical school curriculum</h2>  Published by David Gorski

Comments: 65 <br>

<p>For the second week in a row I find myself throwing out the original post 
that I had planned on doing in favor of a different topic. The reason this week 
is, quite simply, having read Dr. Atwood&rsquo;s excellent two part post<em>
Misleading Language: The Common Currency of &ldquo;CAM&rdquo; Characterizations
</em> (Part I; Part II). I don&rsquo;t at this time intend to expand on what 
Dr. Atwood said, although I may do so at one future time. What caught my 
attention in his lengthy deconstruction was his segment on the 
&ldquo;woo-ification&rdquo; of health care, which very much echoedmy post a 
while back in which I lamented the creeping infiltration of non-science-based 
modalities into academic medical centers, as well as the credulous teaching of 
such modalities in medical schools. What I wanted to explore was just how far 
this might go and what the end result might be. It turns out that we are 
already witnessing an experiment in just such a thing.</p> 
<p>About a year and a half ago, I first became aware of just how far this 
infiltration of unscientific &ldquo;medicine&rdquo; has infiltrated academia 
when I saw thisbrochure published by the Georgetown University School of 
Medicine. If you&rsquo;re scientifically inclined, as I am, it ought to make 
you shudder. Reading this brochure, I truly have to worry whether woo really is 
the future of American medicine, as has beensuggested in some quarters. 
Certainly, if other medical schools start following Georgetown&rsquo;s lead, it 
will be. Not content to offer&nbsp;so-called complementary and alternative 
medicine (&ldquo;CAM&rdquo;) modalities as part of electives that interested 
students can take if they are so inclined, Georgetown is taking the next 
logical step that I feared: It&rsquo;s dedicating significant educational 
resources and time to teaching &ldquo;CAM&rdquo; in its<em>mandatory</em> 
general medical curriculum, whereevery student has to learn it:<br>
</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>Figures on how medical schools are introducing CAM education are less 
definitive. Another study published in JAMA in 1998 reports that 75 of the 117 
participating U.S. medical schools offer CAM elective courses or include CAM 
topics in required courses.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;One of the reasons CAM is usually offered as an elective is that 
there&rsquo;s just no time or room in U.S. medical schools to fit in one more 
massive subject,&rdquo; says Michael Lumpkin, Ph.D., professor and chair of the 
department of physiology and biophysics at Georgetown. &ldquo;When the course 
is an elective, a self-selected group &ndash; maybe 10 or 20 students in a 
class of 180 medical students &ndash; will take it,&rdquo; Lumpkin says. 
&ldquo;What we&rsquo;ve tried at Georgetown is rather than create all new 
courses, we take relevant CAM issues and modalities and weave them seamlessly 
into existing courses.</p> 
<p>The &ldquo;seamless&rdquo; weaving of CAM into existing classes includes, 
for instance, a presentation by an acupuncturist on the &ldquo;anatomy of 
acupuncture&rdquo; in the gross anatomy course for first-year students. The 
same lecturer explores acupuncture&rsquo;s application in pain relief in the 
neuroscience course&hellip;</p> 
<p>Haramati and Lumpkin say Georgetown&rsquo;s program is distinct from CAM 
initiatives in other medical schools in two ways: The school is integrating CAM 
education into existing course work across all four years of each 
student&rsquo;s medical education, and the initiative includes a mind-body 
class to help students use techniques to manage their own health and improve 
self-care.</p> </blockquote> 
<p>Teaching the &ldquo;anatomy of acupuncture&rdquo; in formal anatomy classes 
that<em>every medical student has to take and pass</em>? Great. Heck, why not 
teach &ldquo;intelligent design&rdquo; creationism in basic biology classes 
while they&rsquo;re at 
it?&nbsp;It&nbsp;would&nbsp;be&nbsp;the&nbsp;same&nbsp;idea:&nbsp;Mixing&nbsp;nonscience&nbsp;with&nbsp;science. 
Next they&rsquo;ll be teaching Samuel Hahnemann&rsquo;s &ldquo;principle of 
similars&rdquo; and concept of homeopathic dilution in biochemistry and 
pharmacy classes! Or maybe they&rsquo;ll teach about<em>qi</em> in physiology 
or neurology. In fact, Georgetown&rsquo;s program is actually coming close, as 
it is teaching a veritable cornucopia of unscientific methods: the anatomy of 
acupuncture; stress hormone modulation in physiology; &ldquo;mechanisms&rdquo; 
of acupuncture action in neuroscience; and psychoneuroimmunology in immunology 
courses. In fact, it&rsquo;s worse than that. Not only is this sort of material 
being taught in elective courses, but it is being &ldquo;integrated&rdquo; into 
every aspect of every year of the four year curriculum:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>The first year will include an introduction to CAM practices in ambulatory 
care. In the program&rsquo;s second year, Georgetown aims to double the number 
of mind-body session groups and introduce CAM-related issues in lectures in the 
pharmacology, microbiology, and pathology courses in the students&rsquo; second 
year of medical school.</p> 
<p>A CAM elective will also be offered to fourth-year students. Between year 
two and three of the program, a biomedical research component for students will 
be introduced; in the remaining years, CAM will be further integrated into the 
rest of the preclinical courses and most of the clinical clerkships.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;We welcome the medical students to participate with us in conducting 
those research projects,&rdquo; Lumpkin explains. &ldquo;If students get 
involved in these research projects, it will allow them to go to the cutting 
edge of CAM. They will become the thought leaders in this field.&rdquo;</p> 
</blockquote> 
<p>In other words, they will become advocates for non-science-based 
medicine&ndash;exactly what medicine<em>doesn&rsquo;t</em> need. This is 
ironic, given that it has beenpointed out that &ldquo;CAM&rdquo; is actually 
losing favor in China, where many of the concepts of traditional Chinese 
medicine that underlie large swaths of alternative medicine originated. Here 
the same concepts are taking over the medical school curriculum. Here are the 
principles behind theproject:</p> 
<p>1. Aim CAM curriculum at all students through required courses.<br>
 2. 
Integrate material into basic science courses.&nbsp; For example:<br>
 Gross 
Anatomy: anatomy of acupuncture<br>
 Human Physiology: biofeedback, 
neuromuscular manipulation<br>
 Human Endocrinology: stress hormone modulation 
(relaxation response, meditation, imagery, breathing regulation)<br>
 
Neuroscience: mechanisms of acupuncture action<br>
 Immunology: 
psychoneuroimmunology<br>
 3. Begin on the first day of school, if possible.<br>
 4. Address knowledge, skills and attitudes regarding CAM.<br>
 5. Change 
culture by evolution not revolution</p> 
<p>And Georgetown&rsquo;s rationale for integrating such practices so deeply 
into the curriculum strikes me as disingenuous:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>Haramati realizes that some mainstream medical practitioners remain 
skeptical of CAM due to the perception that such therapies lack the rigorous 
scientific testing that traditional therapies undergo. That&rsquo;s why 
exposing medical students to CAM practices and principles is so important, he 
says.</p> </blockquote> 
<p>&ldquo;Perception&rdquo;? It&rsquo;s not just a &ldquo;perception.&rdquo; 
The vast majority of CAM therapies<em>do</em> lack rigorous scientific testing 
that mainstream medical therapies must undergo. That&rsquo;s a fact, not a 
&ldquo;perception.&rdquo; So what is Georgetown&rsquo;s solution? Integrate 
them into the curriculum because they&rsquo;re not scientifically validated? 
That&rsquo;s putting the cart before the horse! &ldquo;CAM&rdquo; therapies 
needs to be validated through science<em>first</em>. In fact, the purpose of 
medical school is to teach medical students the basics. There&rsquo;s little 
enough room in the curriculum to teach them that. No compelling case that I 
have yet seen has been made that CAM methodologies are so compelling in their 
efficacy that room must be made in the mandatory medical school curriculum for 
them.</p> 
<p>Georgetown does, however, give one reason that&rsquo;s semi-reasonable:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>&ldquo;Rather than to say &lsquo;there&rsquo;s no data here, why teach 
it?&rsquo; we need to inform our students as much as possible about the 
therapies that are out there &hellip; &lsquo;what does the research tell us, 
which are useful, which are dangerous&rsquo;,&rdquo; Haramati explains. He is 
also quick to note the initiative is not a program of advocacy. 
&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not teaching a belief system or teaching students to 
practice CAM, but rather we&rsquo;re informing students about CAM.&rdquo;</p> 
</blockquote> 
<p>My retort would be that it&rsquo;s not necessary to integrate this sort of 
woo deeply into the curriculum in order to accomplish this. For the vast 
majority of CAM therapies, a brief overview would be all that is needed. It is 
not necessary to teach &ldquo;acupuncture points&rdquo; in regular anatomy 
class, particularly when there is no evidence that these points mean anything 
on a strictly anatomic and physiological basis. The organizers of this 
curriculum also point out that many people take herbal remedies and dietary 
supplements, many of which can interact with standard drugs, and cite this as a 
justification for teaching CAM. That is perhaps their best argument, but my 
retort would be that it&rsquo;s not necessary to integrate various non-herbal 
aspects of CAM into the curriculum to accomplish this. In pharmacology class, 
all that would have to be done would be, when teaching drug interactions, to 
include herbal remedies and supplements among the compounds and drugs that can 
interact with each new medication that is discussed and perhaps include a 
module on such remedies. Drug interactions are a very important topic, and It 
is not necessary at all to integrate woo into the medical school curriculum to 
warn future physicians of what herbal medicines might interfere with various 
drugs.</p> 
<p>As for not being a program of advocacy, if that&rsquo;s the case, then why 
is Georgetown not only teaching but also actively<em>encouraging</em> the use 
of &ldquo;mind-body&rdquo; skills that may or may not have any scientific basis
<em>by its own medical students</em>? Why does its program tout that it will be 
starting to teach CAM from the very first day of medical school, as described 
in on the Georgetown website and brochure. This is what I&rsquo;m talking about:
</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>Year one of the five-year grant began in fall 2001, with CAM lectures 
integrated into basic science classes. In winter 2002, educators are 
introducing a new workshop, &ldquo;Mind-Body Medicine: An Experiential and 
Didactic Introduction,&rdquo; which includes topics on a wide range of 
mind-body approaches, including meditation, nutrition, physical exercise, 
relaxation, and self-awareness. Students meet in three or four groups of eight 
to ten people each.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;Over the next five years we&rsquo;ll be training additional faculty 
facilitators,&rdquo; Haramati says. &ldquo;Then they&rsquo;ll form their own 
groups until the entire medical school class is exposed to the utilization of 
mind-body skills.&rdquo; &ldquo;The idea is to help students with the stress of 
the intense course of study and expectations that come with medical 
school,&rdquo; Lumpkin adds. &ldquo;By learning their own techniques of 
self-care, students will naturally internalize that and then be able to use it 
with their patients in the future. This is a skill physicians generally lack 
because it&rsquo;s something they were never taught. In some cases it was 
debunked as being nonsense. Now there&rsquo;s a new view of its 
usefulness.&rdquo;</p> </blockquote> 
<p>Let&rsquo;s see. Georgetown is teaching &ldquo;mind-body&rdquo; medicine to 
its medical students and actively encouraging them to use it, all in the 
context of teaching other areas of woo. Sure, the faculty claim that they will 
be teaching students to &ldquo;critically assess&rdquo; the various CAM 
modalities, but you&rsquo;ll excuse me if I remain skeptical. As I&rsquo;ve 
pointed out before, such programs may start out with the best of intentions 
with regards to a critical assessment of the evidence (or, in the cases of most 
CAM, the lack of evidence for its efficacy). However, over time, these things 
tend to develop a momentum of their own. They also tend to get taken over by 
true believers. This is probably because most doctors committed to EBM just 
aren&rsquo;t that interested in CAM because there&rsquo;s not much good 
evidence for the vast majority of modalities that fall under its label and 
because so many CAM modalities are associated with spiritual/religious concepts 
underlying them that have no business in science. Moreover, advocates of CAM 
tend to be much more passionate about promoting it than skeptics are about 
expressing their skepticism about it. Indeed, if they do, they often are 
labeled as &ldquo;close-minded&rdquo; or &ldquo;intolerant.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Like the program at the University of Michigan, the CAM program at 
Georgetown is funded by a grant from the National Center for Complementary and 
Alternative Medicine (NCCAM). And here&rsquo;s where we come to the most 
pernicious effect of all of NCCAM. The problem is that NCCAM doesn&rsquo;t just 
fund grants to study CAM, which, although it often leads to studies of dubious 
scientific merit about therapies lacking even scientific plausibility, much 
less data, at least is an intellectually and scientifically defensible 
endeavor. Unfortunately, NCCAM goes beyond this and funds grants to promote the 
teaching&ndash;indeed, the integration&ndash;of CAM in medical schools before 
these modalities are scientifically proven. Once again, this putting the cart 
before the horse. The usual order of things in medical education is that 
modalities to be included in the medical curriculum must first have 
considerable evidence of efficacy such that they are considered standard of 
care. Medical school is where students learn the basics. During the first two 
years they learn the well-established basic science, and during the second two 
years they learn how to take care of patients according to the standard of 
care. Then they go on to residency, where they expand on the basics and 
progress to more advanced education in their therapy. The topics and therapies 
that Georgetown is integrating into its curriculum are neither well-established 
science nor the standard of care. Teaching unproven CAM modalities so 
extensively in the core medical school curriculum rather than as electives is 
neither scientifically nor educationally appropriate, as it puts the imprimatur 
of scientific medicine as represented by medical schools on therapies that are 
anything but scientific.</p> 
<p>The virus is spreading.</p> 
<p>Depending on what Dr. Atwood decides to write, next week I may take a look 
at the issue of Academic Medicine from October 2007 and examine some of what 
has been written there in more detail about the teaching of &ldquo;CAM&rdquo; 
in medical school.</p> <br>

<p>Ah, but they will be. Once enough practicing MDs are taught these 
principles and practices, once enough experts in the field are available to 
testify as expert witnesses, etc. then anyone not with the program will become 
heterodox. The woo will become &ldquo;well-established basic science&rdquo; 
simply by virtue of its being taught to everyone as though it were, and the 
standard of care likewise.</p> 
<p>To a first approximation it doesn&rsquo;t matter whether it&rsquo;s planned 
that way or just the working of broader dynamics (e.g. the increasing influence 
of religion and sociologically similar forces in American society.) Regardless 
of root causes, that&rsquo;s the trend.</p> </li>

<p>Aren&rsquo;t these medical schools accredited? Who does the accrediting? 
Can&rsquo;t they just revoke their right to hand out MDs? Do you think it would 
be justifiable to remove accreditation for medical schools teaching the woo?</p>
</li> 
<li> # daedalus2u <em>on 17 Mar 2008 at 9:36 am </em> 
<p>I suspect it is all about money. Teaching CAM must bring in more money. 
Exactly how I am not sure, but if it didn&rsquo;t there is no way it would get 
a foothold.</p> 
<p>The only thing that the administrators are going to listen to is money. 
They are only going to abandon teaching woo if the cost to teaching woo is 
higher than the profit.</p> 
<p>The vast majority of MDs from good medical schools have to be opposed to 
the teaching of woo because it isn&rsquo;t evidence based and isn&rsquo;t 
consistent with the standards of care. If those MD graduates sent letters to 
the schools they graduated from saying no more donations while woo is being 
promoted, and that instead their donations would go to non-woo promoting 
competing schools, I think the promotion of woo would stop. If it didn&rsquo;t, 
then at least non-woo schools would get stronger and the woo schools would get 
weaker.</p> 
<p>If all the schools promote woo, then it does become the &ldquo;standard of 
care&rdquo;. If even a few don&rsquo;t, then those few can always be pointed to 
and used as the &ldquo;real&rdquo; standard. If the non-woo schools get the 
bulk of the donations from non-woo practicing MDs, those non-woo schools will 
persist and become stronger.</p> 
<p>The presence of woo in the curriculum should count against a school in 
accreditation, and in the awarding of research grants.</p> </li> 
<li> # Antono <em>on 17 Mar 2008 at 10:57 am </em> 
<p>This sounds like a bad joke but April Fool&rsquo;s day is still two weeks 
away.</p> 
<p>Especially the part &ldquo;In the program&rsquo;s second year, Georgetown 
aims to double the number of mind-body session groups and introduce CAM-related 
issues in lectures in the pharmacology, microbiology, and pathology courses in 
the students&rsquo; second year of medical school&rdquo; read like some parody 
Mark Crislip would write. I can&rsquo;t believe this BS was written by a US 
medical school, it&rsquo;s ridiculous.</p> 
<p>Just like other members have pointed out, I too believe the USA should be 
regulating more carefully its medical schools and start removing accreditation 
from schools with unscientific curriculum.</p> 
<p>But Education in general is also partly to blame. Why do we allow such 
gullibiliy among the people and even among college graduates? Why don&rsquo;t 
medical students revolt at the absurdity of what is being taught to them? 
Education today is about stuffing minds with facts, not about raising 
critically thinking individuals.</p> 
<p>Yes, the virus is spreading and it may not be long until woo becomes 
standard treatment. But do not despair for this will also be its doom: with 
ever increasing numbers of patients &ldquo;treated&rdquo;, the media will be 
full of failures and side-effects and the public will turn once again to good 
old medicine&hellip; only to go back to CAM when all that travesty will have 
been forgotten. Going in circles unless we get our Education right.</p> </li>

<p>That&rsquo;s clever, but if you walk away from your med school with, 
let&rsquo;s say, the opinion that ginger can&rsquo;t possibly help morning 
sickness but has been proven to interact with warfarin, a subset of your 
patients will be better informed than you are and will know it. Since most 
people aren&rsquo;t aware of MDs&rsquo; limited sources of information, 
they&rsquo;ll assume that your ignorance is a deliberate choice on your part, 
probably arising from strong negative opinions of the subject. If they continue 
to employ your services, they will stop telling you about their use of herbs, 
assuming that any attempt to inform you will be met with scorn and possibly 
worse care or pejorative notes in their charts. Although proven drug-herb 
interactions are far rarer than you are probably taught, they do exist, so this 
creates a potential safety issue. Have you considered how to avoid presenting a 
paternalistic or hostile impression to future patients?</p> </li> 
<li> # DavidCT <em>on 17 Mar 2008 at 12:24 pm </em> 
<p>Much of the information taught in the first years of professional school is 
presented from authority without much critical analysis.<br>
 The evaluation 
skills are often not part of the curriculim. CAM then becomes just something 
more to learn for the tests.</p> 
<p>Think about the effort it must take to learn all the symptoms and matching 
homeopathic medications one must learn during training as a homeopathic 
&ldquo;physician&rdquo;. In addition the student has to learn all the dilutions 
and the ritualistic shaking &ndash; when to tap with a leather bound book and 
when not. Once one goes through all this learning how easy is it to realize 
rationally that it is all just distilled water. Any wonder that you create true 
belivers in woo.</p> 
<p>How easy is it really for even EBM people to change their minds about pet 
beliefs even when new evidence is published. With the amount of art in 
medicine, early teaching of woo cannot be a good thing.</p> </li>

<p>As a 2001 Georgetown Medical School alumnus, I just missed the 
woo-ification of my alma mater, thankfully. Georgetown has always had a 
reputation far better than it deserves (reminds of of the medical student in 
&ldquo;House of God&rdquo; from the &ldquo;very best medical school&rdquo;). 
One year, it was noted that DC public schools had better equipped science 
laboratories than did Georgetown University. My wife received as good a medical 
education as I, through a public medical school at 1/10th of the tuition.</p> 
<p>I am indeed disappointed. Next time Dean Mitchell asks me for my $500 
annual contribution (&ldquo;suggested minimum&rdquo;) I will instead send a 
copy of your excellent article as a way explanation about why I won&rsquo;t be 
sending any more money.</p> 
<p>Georgetown University has a few peculiarities you may not know about. It is 
a Jesuit institution, beholden to the teachings of the Catholic church. Frocked 
priests roam the hall of the medical school, and there are some with PhDs 
research in biology, and several Jesuit MDs.</p> 
<p>Part of the &ldquo;Jesuit philosophy&rdquo; we were told at the very 
beginning of our training was to approach a problem from as many conceivable 
directions as necessary. Though hardly religious myself, it sounded good to me 
at the time. Thus, Jesuit philosophy may be playing a role in the woo-ification 
you outlined above. Even the dean of the medical school has his Jesuit masters.
</p> 
<p>It is just a shame that they are cutting cutting down on proven scientific 
methods to pander to the woo-meisters.</p> </li>

</p> 
<p>Or, perhaps they will just &lsquo;imagine&rsquo; they know better; as you 
seem to do. The research on ginger vs. morning sickness is inconclusive. 
Moreover, there is no evidence for the safety of the fetus if the mother takes 
excessive amounts of ginger (more than is used to spice food). Your, apparent 
belief that ginger is<i>known</i> to work against nausea indicates that you are 
not well-informed.</p> 
<p>A well-informed doctor, who was not taught quackery as if it were real, 
would research your claims. Your suggestion that a good medical education leads 
to the opinion &ldquo;that ginger cannot possibly &hellip;&rdquo; is an invalid 
Straw Man.</p> </li> 
<li> # apteryx <em>on 17 Mar 2008 at 5:10 pm </em> 
<p>There are half a dozen human trials for morning sickness, all positive, 
plus a vast amount of human experience saying that ginger relieves nausea. 
Maybe that is not &ldquo;knowledge&rdquo; to you, but it is certainly 
suggestive evidence. Perhaps as a well-informed doctor, you will go look up the 
clinical trials.</p> 
<p>As for your speech about &ldquo;no evidence&rdquo; for the &ldquo;safety of 
the fetus,&rdquo; well, again, there are half a dozen clinical trials with no 
safety problems, plus a total lack of anecdotal harm. You reflect an 
ethnocentric viewpoint, not only in terming traditional means of symptom relief 
&ldquo;quackery,&rdquo; but in terming a capsule or two of ginger 
&ldquo;excessive&rdquo; because it is &ldquo;more than is used to spice 
food.&rdquo; The fact that your native cuisine disdains pungent flavors and 
uses pungent vegetables in minuscule quantity does not mean that those plants 
are dangerous. Asians, including females, commonly eat this plant as a food and 
drink it as a beverage, often consuming more than a gram per sitting. There is 
no evidence whatsoever that this impairs their reproduction.</p> 
<p>You have chosen to claim that I put up a straw man, or &ldquo;Straw 
Man,&rdquo; by suggesting that you might tell your patients with morning 
sickness that ginger could not help them. But your words above suggest that you 
would discourage them from using it, pooh-poohing any evidence in its favor, 
and that if they openly disagreed with you, you would call them &ldquo;not well 
informed&rdquo; and club them with the completely unsupported threat of danger 
to their embryos. That&rsquo;s paternalism of the plainest kind. It also makes 
me wonder: would you try to pressure pregnant women of Asian origin to abandon 
their traditional cuisines, to the extent that those include flavorful plants 
in greater amounts than [you] used to spice food? I have heard of American 
pediatricians pressuring immigrant mothers to feed their toddlers unspiced 
pablum; please tell me you wouldn&rsquo;t plan to extend that down to the 
zygote stage!</p> </li>

<p>Apteryx &ldquo;Perhaps as a well-informed doctor, you will go look up the

<p><i>I did</i>, as I said, they are inconclusive. Perhaps you can cite some 
that are compelling.</p> 
<p>Apteryx &ldquo;As for your speech about &ldquo;no evidence&rdquo; for the 
&ldquo;safety of the fetus,&rdquo; well, again, there are half a dozen clinical 
trials with no safety problems&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Another half-dozen experiments (I suppose you will cite them)! The data is 
underwhelming. What sort of harm could they have identified?</p> 
<p>Apteryx &ldquo;But your words above suggest that you would discourage them 
from using it &hellip;&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Your ability to &ldquo;read for meaning&rdquo; is failing you as badly as 
your ability to read my mind. Whence do you derive your thoroughgoing 
inabilities?</p> 
<p>The bottom line remains: medical professionals need to look at 
science-based treatments, not your wishful thinking and anecdotes. If you can 
present compelling evidence that ginger is safe and effective, it will become 
&lsquo;medicine.&rsquo;</p> 
<p>On the other hand, what would it take to convince you ginger is not safe 
and effective? Most members of pseudomedical cults cannot relinquish their 
beliefs. Are you one of those?</p> </li>

<p>Are you kidding? It is well known that mental states can influence physical 
health. We know that meditation, or relaxation, can decrease stress, and we 
know that excessive stress can be harmful to the body.</p> 
<p>If physicians are going to advise patients in makes perfect sense to 
educate them in relaxation techniques. A physician who knows nothing about 
health except which drug to prescribe, or what diagnostic and surgical 
technology to use, is incomplete as a health expert.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a good review article on ginger at: 
http://www.aafp.org/afp/20070601/1689.html. </p> 
<p>A Cochrane review concluded that it is effective for nausea of pregnancy. 
The Natural Medicines Comprehensive Database rates it &ldquo;possibly 
effective&rdquo; and warns:</p> 
<p>Using ginger during pregnancy is controversial. There is some concern due 
to preliminary evidence that ginger might affect fetal sex hormones and an 
anecdotal report of spontaneous abortion during week 12 of pregnancy in a 
patient who used ginger for morning sickness. However, studies in pregnant 
women suggest that ginger can be used safely for morning sickness without harm 
to the fetus. As with any medication given during pregnancy, the potential 
benefit to risk.</p> 
<p>Does anyone remember Bendectin? It was a safe, effective morning sickness 
treatment that we used for years. It was taken off the market because of junk 
science lawsuits, and a lot of women ended up taking remedies that were 
potentially more dangerous. All it was was B6 and doxylamine, both available 
over the counter. I remember it as a glaring example of the triumph of legal 
paranoia over science.</p> </li>

<p>Hi Dave,</p> 
<p>I won&rsquo;t be addressing the Oct. &rsquo;07 Acad Med &ldquo;theme&rdquo; 
issue, so have at it.</p> 
<p>Regarding ginger and morning sickness, there is a bit of evidence favoring 
it but the studies are small and the effect modest, if it really exists. It 
also appears to be safe in pregnancy, but this is not certain:</p> 
<p>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1988321?dopt=Abstract</p> 
<p>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10796155?dopt=Abstract</p> 
<p>http://www.greenjournal.org/cgi/content/full/97/4/577</p> 
<p>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14634571?dopt=Abstract</p> 
<p>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15802416?dopt=Abstract</p> 
<p>My own view is that this kind of evidence suggests that it may be useful to 
investigate ginger for a possible anti-nausea substance(s). If such is found it 
can be standardized for dose-risk and dose-therapeutic effect relations, and 
also provide a potential starting point for new, more specific (and therefore 
safer and more effective) synthetic analogues. That is the rational process for 
discovering and developing new, useful drugs, as has previously been done with 
numerous substances found in nature.</p> 
<p>The &ldquo;CAM&rdquo; process is quite different: it assumes, for various 
implausible reasons, that preparations made from the whole root (in this case) 
are preferable to purified molecules, both in safety and effectiveness; it 
neglects the nearly impossible task of standardizing potencies of the several 
potential biologically-active molecules in the plant, given the number of 
varieties, the ever-changing growing conditions, and the many extraction 
methods; and it makes an arbitrary and therapeutically irrational distinction 
between &ldquo;natural&rdquo; and &ldquo;synthetic,&rdquo; always preferring 
the former&mdash;whereas the latter has the greater chance of being useful, for 
the reasons mentioned above.</p> 
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how many readers remember a coarse talk-show host in NYC 
in the &rsquo;60s by the name of Joe Pyne. He was a right-wing shock-jock, kind 
of a precursor of Bill O&rsquo;Reilly and Rush Limbaugh. At one point the 
anti-war crowd were wearing buttons that read &ldquo;Send Joe Pyne to 
college.&rdquo; I&rsquo;ve been fantasizing a button reading &ldquo;Send pec to 
medical school.&rdquo; I&rsquo;m sorry, pec; I want to like you, in the sense 
that I&rsquo;m content to believe that you are sincere but that you are a 
victim of a woefully inadequate grounding in both science and in critical 
thinking skills, and for that I feel genuinely sorry for you.</p> 
<p>But you write, &ldquo;A physician who knows nothing about health except 
which drug to prescribe, or what diagnostic and surgical technology to use, is 
incomplete as a health expert&rdquo;&mdash;as though &ldquo;which drug to 
prescribe&rdquo; and &ldquo;technology&rdquo; overwhelm physiology, anatomy, 
biochemistry, neurobiology, immunology, hematology, histology, embryology, 
genetics, pathophysiology, pharmacology (which is not the same thing as 
&ldquo;which drug to prescribe&rdquo;), the natural history of disease, 
learning how to take histories that are useful, other interviewing techniques, 
physical examinations, making sense of signs and symptoms, smatterings (at 
least) of almost every clinical field from psychiatry to pediatrics to 
obstetrics to internal medicine to surgery and various surgical 
sub-specialties, radiology, dermatology and more, learning preventive medicine 
and clinical problem-solving, learning how to think about clinical research and 
literature, and all the rest of the enormous body of knowledge and skills that 
constitute becoming a physician.</p> 
<p>You present a broad and complex topic (&ldquo;stress&rdquo;) as though it 
were specific and simple. You readily offer truisms, written in the phony 
passive voice (thank you, Calli Arcale), such as &ldquo;It is well known that 
mental states can influence physical health,&rdquo; when the reality is far 
less sanguine. All of this betrays immaturity and a lack of sophistication.</p> 
<p>If you are actually a young person, perhaps of college age or not much 
older, I implore you to re-apply yourself to your studies and stop wasting your 
time here looking for reasons to make inane, contrary comments. If you are as 
old as you&rsquo;ve represented yourself to be, it&rsquo;s time to take a good, 
long look in the mirror and start owning up to the truth: either you 
didn&rsquo;t really read Sagan&rsquo;s &ldquo;The Dragon in My Garage,&rdquo;

<p>I suspect that the nausea of morning sickness is actually a sign of very 
high NO levels and that this high NO is actually beneficial to pregnancy 
outcomes. There is an inverse correlation with nausea levels and adverse 
pregnancy outcomes.</p> 
<p>Nitric oxide is involved in some types of nausea. Other nausea is 
exacerbated by placebos. Nausea is often a normal accompaniment of gastric 
hypermobility. The gut is nitrergic, suggesting that high NO causes both. Acute 
hypoxia can cause nausea. Vomiting (a not infrequent outcome of nausea) is 
mediated largely through smooth muscle which is largely regulated through NO.
</p> 
<p>I speculate that the reason that very high NO levels are desirable during 
the first trimester is that is when most all of the differentiation is 
happening and when DNA replication and epigenetic programming has to have the 
highest fidelity. During organ differentiation is the time when a lot of 
epigenetic programming of those organs occurs. Many mechanisms are known to 
involve NO. Many organs are known to be programmed in utero including liver, 
heart, vasculature, endocrine system, etc. It would be beyond surprising if the 
most important organ, the brain were not. Some of my research involves the 
programming effects of NO on various organs both in utero and later. NO is an 
excellent antioxidant, several thousand times better than vitamin E. High NO 
causes high ATP via sGC allowing metabolic functions to operate well. NO blocks 
formation of superoxide by hemes.</p> 
<p>The metabolic demand in the first trimester is small. Some studies actually 
show reduced basal metabolic rate during the first trimester over the 
non-pregnant state. Expanding mitochondria and erythrocyte production is 
important, and both of those are directly increased by high NO levels.</p> 
<p>I suspect that if this high NO level is reduced by any mechanism that 
adverse pregnancy outcomes will increase. This increase may be quite modest and 
difficult to measure. It may also have quite diverse and idiosyncratic effects. 
It is not that the anti-emetics are causing any adverse outcomes, rather more 
adverse outcomes accompany a low NO state. The details of which specific 
adverse outcomes occur are complex and could be all over the map.</p> 
<p>Any treatment that reduces NO levels would be expected to have these 
effects. Ginger has a number of molecules that are metabolized by the 
cytochrome P450 system. The P450 system is regulated by NO, and is quite 
uncoupled, that is it produces superoxide when metabolizing compounds. A 
plausible mechanism by which ginger reduces nausea is by causing local 
oxidative stress due to activation of P450 enzymes, which pulls down the NO 
level and reduces the threshold for nausea. If that is the mechanism, then it 
would likely also reduce the threshold for adverse outcomes in pregnancy.</p> 
<p>I suspect there is no method that will reliably reduce nausea in pregnancy 
without increasing adverse outcomes in pregnancy (at least slightly). I suspect 
that even biofeedback and purely neurogenic methods will still increase adverse 
effects via decreasing NO levels. These effects would be very difficult to see, 
and as I see them are part of the &ldquo;normal&rdquo; spectrum of outcomes of 
pregnancy. The slight increases may not be measurable. Adult hypertension is a 
known consequence of &ldquo;stress&rdquo; in utero. Stress is a low NO state, 
the &ldquo;adverse outcomes&rdquo; can also be thought of as normal stress 
responses. In the &ldquo;wild&rdquo;, a time of high stress is not a good time 
to be pregnant. Ending that pregnancy in the safest way, such as via preterm 
birth might be one of the &ldquo;normal&rdquo; responses to low NO. If one 
carries that pregnancy to term, the infant&rsquo;s physiology needs to be 
programmed to survive in a high stress environment. The increased adverse 
effects due to lowering NO in pregnancy that I am contemplating would be 
independent of any other direct adverse effect anti-emetics might have.</p>

<p>Thanks to Drs. Hall and Atwood for providing links in response to 
Joe&rsquo;s query. I see no reason to respond further to Joe, and given his 
rhetorical style, hope that he is not actually a practicing MD.</p> 
<p>Dr. Atwood writes:</p> 
<p>&ldquo;My own view is that this kind of evidence suggests that it may be

relations, and also provide a potential starting point for new, more specific 
(and therefore safer and more effective) synthetic analogues. &rdquo;</p> 
<p>Therefore, how? This is not a law of nature; it&rsquo;s an article of 
faith, touted without evidence. I picked ginger as an example, rather than 
another well-proven botanical such as horse chestnut, because it is also a 
conventional food. We seldom worry about &ldquo;dose-risk relations&rdquo; when 
we eat food, yet somehow we survive. If an isolated and patented molecule were 
always &ldquo;safer and more effective&rdquo; than plants as found in nature, 
then No-Doz would be safer than green tea, a capsule of pure sennoside would 
have fewer side effects than senna tea, and &hellip;oh, yeah&hellip; pure 
cocaine would be safer than chewing coca leaf. More often, I think, 
concentrating any one of the multiple active compounds in a plant and giving an 
enormous dose of that alone is a good way to increase side effects.</p> 
<p>Anyway, how can you claim that your potent single molecule will be BOTH 
safer and more effective? You are saying that the single molecule will be more 
bioactive in terms of desired effects yet less bioactive when it comes to 
causing side effects &mdash; and that this is not just occasionally true but a 
general rule. Can anyone come up with any supporting evidence for that? The 
idea that the health benefits of fruits and vegetables can be replaced by a 
vitamin pill has already been clearly debunked.</p> </li>

&ldquo;Ginger reduces nausea, according to some, but not all, controlled

<p>Salicylic acid is found in some plants (e.g., meadow sweet, not in willow) 
and it has antipyretic and analgesic properties. However, it is very irritating 
to the stomach. Acetyl salicylic acid (aspirin) is more pharmacologically 
useful and much better tolerated. (A. Pengelly &ldquo;The Constituents of

<p>Yes, a specific molecule would be more bioactive than &ldquo;natural&rdquo; 
and could cause side effects. However, with a KNOWN potency (unlike the 
natural), the dosage could be titrated to lessen the side effect while seeking 
the effective dosage.</p> </li> 
<li> # daedalus2u <em>on 18 Mar 2008 at 12:36 pm </em> 
<p>Apteryx, it is pretty obvious that not all compounds in ginger are 
pharmacologically active in reducing nausea. There are at least thousands of 
compounds, more likely tens or hundreds of thousands. If a compound has no 
therapeutic effect in reducing nausea, it may still have physiological effect 
in causing side effects. Removing compounds that don&rsquo;t reduce nausea and 
that do cause side effects will both increase efficacy and reduce side effects.
</p> 
<p>Identifying those compounds and supplying them in pure form at known 
dosages allows the therapeutic effect to be titrated against any side effects. 
Something that cannot be done with materials of unknown composition with 
variable effects and side effects.</p> 
<p>Cocaine has a high potential for abuse both as pure cocaine hydrochloride 
and also as coca leaf. Pure cocaine hydrochloride can be used as a local 
anesthetic. Something that coca leaf cannot be used for.</p> 
<p>A dull knife is &ldquo;safer&rdquo; than a sharp knife. A dull knife is 
also a lot less useful as a tool. Sharp knives should be only used by those 
proficient in their use so that accidents and abuse is avoided. The same is 
true of purified pharmaceutically active agents.</p> </li> 
<li> # apteryx <em>on 18 Mar 2008 at 12:42 pm </em> 
<p>Zetetic &ndash; Anti-botanical pundits tend to assume that botanicals have 
only one active molecule, which presumably causes side effects as well as 
benefits. Yet they promise that the drug-discovery process will give us 
souped-up effects with reduced side effects. How is that possible? Also, above, 
you are assuming that there ARE significant side effects to begin with, 
otherwise we could hardly demand that consumers spend more money on the drug 
product to &ldquo;lessen&rdquo; them. By and large, the botanicals still 
allowed on our market are very safe. Some, like ginger, are foods. How likely 
is it that a randomly selected Big Pharma product will be safer than a food?</p>
<p>To address Joe&rsquo;s remarks for the benefit of other readers:</p> 
<p>Homemade horse chestnut products indeed are unsafe. Commercial products are 
made with specific techniques to remove the toxic compounds &mdash; some people 
seem to think there is no such thing as standardization of botanicals, but 
there is &mdash; and have generally minor side effects in clinical trials. 
There have been enough trials of horse chestnut for leg edema that it received 
a favorable Cochrane review. FDA has no evidence that the commercial products 
are dangerous in ordinary use. If they did, they would have the power under 
DSHEA to remove them from the market. The MSKCC site Joe linked to has the 
following to say:</p> 
<p>&ldquo;Commercial products should be standardized to 50 mg of aescin and 
free from aesculin, a hydroxycoumarin. Studies have shown clinical efficacy in 
chronic venous insufficiency (7) (8) (9)&hellip;. At recommended doses no 
significant adverse reactions are reported.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>This is not the dire warning implied by Joe.</p> 
<p>Acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) is easier on the stomach than purified 
salicylic acid was, although aspirin still kills thousands of people annually. 
Willow bark contains salicin in relatively low doses. It is not clear whether 
the low-dose salicin in willow bark tea is more or less irritating than 
high-dose aspirin. Anyway, if the aspirin is safer, that would be one instance 
for which that was true. I was asking for support for the general claim that if 
you select a random botanical and make a concentrated drug from one of its 
active molecules, that drug will be &ldquo;safer&rdquo; than the botanical 
&ndash; which is ludicrous on the face of it. It is true for digitalis. It is 
not true for cranberry juice.</p> </li> 
<li> # apteryx <em>on 18 Mar 2008 at 12:47 pm </em> 
<p>Daedalus -<br>
 In other words, the potent pill with its delicate balance 
of benefits and toxicities can only be prescribed by an MD, and therefore 
received only by someone who can shell out $100 or so for the office visit 
&ndash; plus maybe more money for office visits for more prescriptions to deal 
with the side effects. With botanicals, you can sometimes go to the grocery 
store, or your own backyard, and get perhaps weaker effects for $2.</p> 
<p>Again, why do you fret so about the &ldquo;side effects&rdquo; of ginger? 
Do you have any reason to think there ARE any? Has anyone in recorded history 
ever dropped dead from eating stir-fried ginger?</p> </li> 
<li> # daedalus2u <em>on 18 Mar 2008 at 3:45 pm </em> 
<p>There are more reasons to think there are side effects from ginger when 
used as a drug than there are reasons to think there are no side effects when 
using ginger as a drug. The only way to determine if there actually are side 
effects of using ginger or the pharmacologically active compounds in ginger is 
to test them. Until they are tested, whether they do have side effects or do 
not have side effects is unknown.</p> 
<p>Humans did not evolve in symbiosis with ginger. The compounds in ginger are 
xenobiotic as far as human physiology is concerned. The ginger plant was not 
intelligently designed so as to provide an anti-nausea drug for humans. The 
ginger plant evolved to have these compounds in it for its own reasons, not to 
provide medicinal effects to humans. Many compounds in plants are there to 
deter predation by herbivores.</p> 
<p>Some compounds that are teratogens have no or only minor adverse effects in 
adults. Until the compounds in ginger have been tested whether they are 
teratogens at what doses remains unknown.</p> 
<p>Alcohol has been used as a food for millennia. It is now well known to be a 
teratogen.</p> </li> 
<li> # apteryx <em>on 18 Mar 2008 at 4:45 pm </em> 
<p>All I can offer for ginger is: A, one rat study of teratogenicity (not 
finding any); B, no increase in birth defects in any of several human trials; 
and C, the fact that in parts of India pregnant women make a point of eating a 
lot of ginger, and they reproduce successfully enough to have one hell of a 
population problem. What do you want to hear? You say that only formal trials 
mean anything, then you don&rsquo;t seem interested in the results of the 
trials that have been published. If Santa Claus gave me a couple hundred 
million to do a study with thousands of pregnant women, would you accept the 
results of that study, or would you carp that it was unethical to &ldquo;put 
their babies at risk by letting them consume a botanical&rdquo;?</p> 
<p>I suppose humans could be said not to have &ldquo;evolved in 
symbiosis&rdquo; with any food plants not native to Africa, although humans 
have been in Australia, via Asia, for 50,000 years. But somehow I don&rsquo;t 
think you would be less fearful of African wild plant foods than of the 
European cultivars that we&rsquo;ve used for less than two millennia. You could 
make the same claim above about any food plant whatsoever. I don&rsquo;t like 
cauliflower; well, it&rsquo;s got icky-tasting defensive secondary metabolites 
in it, maybe it&rsquo;s a teratogen. Maybe they should get that stuff off the 
market &ldquo;until it&rsquo;s tested.&rdquo; Should pregnant women eat nothing 
but white flour and meat (aka the Bland Cancer-Promoting Diet)? What about the 
large majority of the population who are not pregnant? Can they take it that a 
plant is safe enough for medicinal use, if hundreds of millions of people have 
eaten it for dinner?</p> 
<p>I say this in a friendly spirit: Piffle.</p> </li> 
<li> # daedalus2u <em>on 18 Mar 2008 at 6:41 pm </em> 
<p>I don&rsquo;t say that only formal trials mean something.</p> 
<p>When there is no general understanding for the physiological basis behind 
the nausea of early pregnancy, and when there is an inverse correlation between 
nausea in pregnancy and adverse pregnancy outcomes, I think it is presumptuous 
to assume that treatments that do away with nausea have no side effects. The 
physiology that causes the nausea may have a beneficial role all by itself. All 
women may not react the same way. All fetuses may not react the same way. All 
ginger may not be equal.</p> 
<p>There may be changes that are real, yet may be too subtle to measure in any 
particular individual. For example adults exposed to nutritional deprivation in 
utero have more health problems as adults.</p> 
<p>http://jp.physoc.org/cgi/content/full/565/1/27</p> 
<p>http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/full/104/31/12796</p> 
<p>Some of these effects are subtle and may not show up until middle age. Did 
someone with the metabolic syndrome get it because of exposure in utero or 
because they didn&rsquo;t exercise or because their mother ate ginger as an 
anti-emetic?</p> 
<p>I am not making a claim; you are making the claim that there are no adverse 
effects from eating pharmacological doses of ginger. At some dose ginger does 
have side effects. Ginger does have an LD50.</p> 
<p>When purified compounds are used, the metabolism of them is simpler than 
the metabolism of those compounds plus thousands of others. It is easier to 
look for side effects with a single compound than for a complex (and variable) 
mixture of thousands of compounds.</p> 
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if ginger has adverse effects during pregnancy. If 
&ldquo;everyone&rdquo; in India eats ginger during their pregnancy, perhaps 
they are all immune, or perhaps if they didn&rsquo;t eat so much ginger over 
historic time we would now be speaking Hindi because Indians would have 
industrialized first and conquered the world instead of Europeans. Maybe ginger 
does cause problems during pregnancy but perhaps ginger is also good treatment 
for intestinal parasites native to India and if you have intestinal parasites 
getting rid of them with ginger is worth the side effects that ginger has.</p>

Can anyone come up with any supporting evidence for that?&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Yes, it&rsquo;s a general rule, and yes, there is plenty of supporting 
evidence. Others have already begun to explain, but the points are these: a 
single molecule lacks the biological (&ldquo;side&rdquo;) effects of the many 
other molecules that exist in a mixture; a known dose of a single molecule 
provides a more predictable biological response&mdash;both desired and 
undesired&mdash;than an unknown or widely-varying dose of that same molecule 
(as is typically found in a plant or plant extract); and chemical alterations 
of a single molecule can (and have, many, many times) result in new molecules 
that are either more specific for a desired biological effect than was their 
precursor (and thus as effective at a lower dose, hence reducing undesired 
effects) or that have lower incidences of undesired effects, or both.</p> 
<p>That &ldquo;formulation&rdquo; (ouch!) is the basis for modern 
pharmaceutical development. Please don&rsquo;t confuse what&rsquo;s wrong with 
&ldquo;BigPharm&rdquo;&mdash;shameless advertising, COIs involved in sponsoring 
trials, concealing of unflattering information, which we bloggers don&rsquo;t 
like any better than you&mdash;with what&rsquo;s right with it: pharmaceutical 
R&amp;D and manufacturing, ie, the science and technology. There are so many 
examples that it would (and does) take whole textbooks to illustrate them, but 
it&rsquo;s easy to find several that are relevant to material on SBM.</p> 
<p>Consider an example that you cited: Google &ldquo;cocaine&rdquo; and 
&ldquo;local anesthetics&rdquo; and you&rsquo;ll quickly find an historical 
timeline leading from the intriguing but not very useful effects, in the 
medicinal sense, of coca leaf, to cocaine itself 150 years ago, which is an 
excellent local anesthetic (it was how local anesthesia was discovered) but has 
other effects that are undesirable, to the first synthetic analogue, procaine 
(Novocaine, ca. 1910), which lacked those undesirable effects, to lidocaine 
(ca. 1940), the first really good synthetic LA (it has a more rapid onset than 
procaine, gives a more intense nerve block, and lasts longer), to procainamide, 
bupivicaine, prilocaine, mepivicaine, ropivicaine, and other synthetic 
derivatives, each of which has useful distinguishing properties.</p> 
<p>Some are longer acting, some are shorter acting, some have less effect on 
the electrical activity of the heart, which makes them safer for the large 
doses used in major nerve blocks, others have specific effects on the heart 
that makes them useful as anti-arrhythmics(procainamide), some have greater or 
lesser effects on the brain; the entire class of &ldquo;amide&rdquo; local 
anesthetics, of which lidocaine was the first, is less allergenic than its 
&ldquo;ester&rdquo; precursors (of which cocaine is one); and more.</p> 
<p>All LAs, beginning with cocaine, have similar tertiary structures: a 
lipophilic end (typically an aromatic ring), a hydrocarbon chain (no more than 
2-3 carbons, typically), and a hydrophilic end. Altering any of these regions 
changes biologic effects, and after much experience such 
&ldquo;structure-activity&rdquo; relationships both help us learn about how 
things work and allow pharmacologists to make educated guesses about what new 
alterations might be useful.</p> 
<p>This sort of process has been successfully used countless times. Other 
examples relevant to SBM posts include HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors 
(&ldquo;statins&rdquo;), originally isolated from microorganisms much more 
recently (ca. 1970), with synthetic derivatives that have varied widely enough 
in adverse effects to suggest that it will be possible to fashion new ones that 
have extremely low risks but maintain the desired effect. I won&rsquo;t get 
into the statin argument here except to make a point that may not have been 
made before: as drugs go, these are quite new and have a huge upside potential 
for improvement.</p> 
<p>Another example relevant to SBM is cinchona bark, from which quinine was 
found to be the active antimalarial ingredient, which itself led to the 
synthesis of the useful drugs quinidine and mefloquine. Artemisinin, an 
antimalarial from the Chinese artemisia tree whose specific identity and proof 
of effectiveness was accomplished only 35 years ago, even though it had been 
part of herbal fever remedies for hundreds of years, is also now in the process 
of being altered for useful analogues.</p> 
<p>A few readers probably have asthma. Let&rsquo;s look at one of their staple 
treatments from the opposite direction of time and innovation: albuterol is a 
synthetic &ldquo;beta-2 agonist.&rdquo; That means that it stimulates beta-2 
adrenergic receptors, which mainly causes bronchodilation (useful for asthma) 
and uterine relaxation. If an asthmatic who isn&rsquo;t pregnant inhales 
albuterol, the main effect is desirable and the side effects are minimal. A few 
years ago the best beta receptor agonist, isoproterenol (also synthetic), was 
not specific to receptor types 1 or 2. Thus if an asthmatic came to an 
emergency room needing treatment, he was likely to get a drug that worked but 
caused unpleasant heart-racing as a side effect, or perhaps he was denied that 
drug because it would have been too dangerous if he also had heart disease.</p> 
<p>A few years before that, the only choice for a beta-adrenergic agent would 
have been the naturally-occurring epinephrine (adrenaline), which is not only 
non-selective between beta-1 and 2 receptors, but also between alpha and beta 
receptors. Thus dangerously high blood pressures and several other side effects 
would have been added to those previously mentioned.</p> 
<p>In theory it could have been even worse in the old days, if cow adrenal 
glands&mdash;with norepinephrine, a very potent natural alpha agonist, several 
kinds of steroid hormones, and numerous other molecules that our bodies would 
probably not much like&mdash;had been ground up and used as either inhaled or 
injectable medicines. As far as I know that was never done, but it would be the 
obvious analogy to the &ldquo;CAM&rdquo; preference for whole plants or parts 
of plants&mdash;except, of course, that if such a preparation were taken by the 
oral route it would be relatively innocuous, and the adrenergic molecules 
themselves would not be sufficiently absorbed to have any effect, useful or 
otherwise. I realize I&rsquo;m wandering a bit here.</p> 
<p>Everyone can think of other classes of drugs that have gone through the 
stages of native 
source&ndash;extraction&ndash;purification&ndash;standardization of potency and 
dosing&ndash;synthesis of analogues, resulting in predictable, useful 
improvements in desired and undesired effects at virtually each stage. Two more 
examples are antibiotics and narcotics.</p> </li>

<p>Thanks to Joe, Daedalus, and Katwood, I am receiving an ecellent Board xam 
review in pharmacology, and also receiving points in my ongoing arguments with 
a certain family member as to &ldquo;why&rdquo; I am on this blog.</p> 
<p>Returning to the titled subject, &ldquo;CAM&rdquo; teaching in medical 
schools, I can offer the following, which I hope can add insight into the 
questions as to &ldquo;why&rdquo; we have coe to this.</p> 
<p>I have two or three articles on this if one has time and the interest to 
read them. One on The Need for reform in Teaching of &ldquo;CAM&rdquo; in 
medical schools is in Academic Medicine, 2000-2002 &ndash; see Pubmed listing. 
(I am now repeating what I placed in a prior entry.) I implied that we were 
then on an asceding curve of sectarian med entry into medical schools. Of the 
then (1995-7) 57 or so courses in 125 US med schools only 4 or 5 taught 
subjects from scientific, analytical view. Since then, 2 of them are gone with 
the retirement of their teachers. One newer one appeared (U Brit. Col.) in 
Canada.</p> 
<p>I reviewed the content of many of the courses through questionnaires, web 
sites, and requested outlines. The questionnaire replies were sometimes caustic 
and cynical, the course heads (joke?) having sniffed out my &ldquo;bias.&rdquo; 
But most were straightforward. Fifty two never entertained presenting 
scientific arguments opposing efficacy/use, and none invited a skeptical 
presentation.</p> 
<p> The editors did not want to publish the article &ndash; a subject for 
longer exposition &ndash; they objected to the time delay, the 
&ldquo;orientation&rdquo; and so forth. It made them uncomfortable. And much 
-including the caustic comments &ndash; was redlined. But talk about an 
anechoic response&hellip;the anti-echo came back with new foundations with more 
and diferent funding agendas, providing fertilizer ($$$$) for the courses David 
Gorski described. It seemed that the only peole who read it or were affected by 
it were proponents, who felt it as a whip on their behinds so to run even 
faster.</p> 
<p> The other two articles are on the history of the &ldquo;CAM&rdquo; 
development in No. America and Europe. It looked to me like the pseudoscience 
interest rose and fell over time in a cyclic fashion, like so many other social 
phenomena, but with separate waves of differing methods out of phase.</p> 
<p> The 3rd one was on the influence of post-modernism and cultural relativism 
(CR) on preparing the soil for the present growth. Here seemed to be the 
missing link that turned the heads of the academics and a significant 
percentage of mystical-bending practitioners, and spurred interest the splay of 
non-professionals and quasi-professionals whose ads one sees in small weekly 
newspapers and in Yellow Pages.</p> 
<p> CR as has been discussed, creates a content equity between scientific and 
pseudo-scientific systems. CR&rsquo;s association with racial equality and 
international commercialism, environmental conservation, and other social goods 
and artifacts of modern living, benefits from use of common language and a 
commonality of thought about dangers and misuse of science (radiation, animal 
experimentation, synthetic chemicals and drugs. And, professionalism and 
intellectual know-it-allism) So scientific medicine becomes a stand-in enemy 
for unhappy and somatiforming souls, whose internally generated conflicts can 
be comfortably externalized and then written about, meeting-about, and scolded 
through faculty meetings.<br>
 Political/academic correctness takes care of the 
rest.</p> 
<p> But how about them funders? The NCCAM is the biggest of course, and 
combined with service departments (Army, Navy, Defense Dept. and now USAF) has 
exceeded $1 billion.</p> 
<p> The second largest, Bravewell, is the main private force behind 
development of courses and training programs. They have gathered 35 + med 
schools for teaching courses and a lesser number for postgraduate training in 
&ldquo;CAM.&rdquo; The NCCAM appropriated something like $10 million for 
fifteen med schools PG programs. This is for teaching practitioners, no less, 
not just teching students about &ldquo;CAM.&rdquo;</p> </li> 
<li> # Wallace Sampson <em>on 19 Mar 2008 at 6:03 am </em> 
<p>[Sorry, the post went off prematurely...]</p> 
<p>The second article above on the history is in Sci Rev Altern Med, and the 
third, &ldquo;Postmodern Medicine&rdquo; is also. That journal is not 
abstracted on Medline. When the publisher updates the web site (SRAM.org) some 
articles will be there.</p> 
<p>Looks like we will be covering some previous ground, but there is enough 
new every 4 years to do so &ndash; maybe evry year at this rate of change.</p>

<p>Dr. Atwood -</p> 
<p>I have seen someone (can&rsquo;t remember who) make the following argument: 
Suppose you were to go into a pharmacy blindfolded, pick either one herbal 
dietary supplement or one prescription drug derived from a natural product off 
the shelf at random, then take the whole bottle at once. Which would be more 
likely to severely harm or kill you? No question, it would be the drug.</p> 
<p>The drugs you mention are indeed improvements over the natural products 
from which they are derived. Artemisia annua tea is a fairly effective 
treatment for malaria, but concentrated derivatives of artemisinin (which is 
only one of several active compounds) are even better, and given the degree of 
misery malaria causes, patients who can afford them will prefer them. But the 
more potent product is not always better. There is a balance between potency, 
cost, and side effects, and it does not make sense to attack every symptom with 
the biggest possible hammer no matter what. Also, some botanicals cannot be 
turned into single-compound drugs without losing efficacy. If there were only 
one molecule in horse chestnut that affected leg edema, or only one molecule in 
hawthorn that improved heart function, some drug company would by now have 
sifted it out, slightly altered and patented it, and be doing Phase III trials. 
These botanicals have whole suites of active ingredients, and patients will 
gain more benefit from multicomponent products.</p> 
<p>To return, as Dr. Sampson has done, to the original theme &mdash; these are 
not controversial statements among people aware of the state of research on 
botanicals. Traditional med schools have been cranking out doctors who believe, 
and instruct patients, that plants are probably harmful but never helpful 
unless they both can be and have been made into drugs. These days, many 
patients are too well informed to accept such blanket claims. If I come into 
your office and suggest trying ginger rather than the side-effect-heavy drug 
you might prescribe for my motion sickness, and you go off on a tirade 
suggesting, like Joe above, that I may belong to a &ldquo;pseudomedical 
cult&rdquo; or, like Daedalus above, that consumers of non-European cuisines 
may be somehow defective &mdash; well, next time I have a minor condition to 
deal with, I will say the heck with you and look for an herbalist. To put it in 
economic terms, since medicine is a lucrative industry these days: You will 
lose business. If you want to keep me as a patient, you don&rsquo;t need to 
recommend traditional medicines, but if you want to express strong opinions on 
the subject, you had better show that you have seen as much of the relevant 
research as I have.</p> </li> 
<li> # Kimball Atwood <em>on 19 Mar 2008 at 11:16 am </em> 
<p>&ldquo;Suppose you were to go into a pharmacy blindfolded, pick either one 
herbal dietary supplement or one prescription drug derived from a natural 
product off the shelf at random, then take the whole bottle at once. Which 
would be more likely to severely harm or kill you? No question, it would be the 
drug.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>I agree, but the reason is a simple one: most &ldquo;herbal dietary 
supplements&rdquo; have much lower doses of biologically-active substances, 
whether helpful or harmful, than do prescription drugs. Don&rsquo;t we agree 
that if the same biologically-active molecule is present in the same dose in a 
pharmaceutically-manufactured pill or in a plant extract, that its biological 
effect must be the same? You imply, later in your comment, that the recommended 
doses (if that&rsquo;s what you mean by &ldquo;potency&rdquo;) for 
pharmaceuticals are too high. That&rsquo;s possible, but seems unlikely in 
light of their having been determined by dose-response trials. An alternative 
explanation is that consumers&rsquo; perceptions of the effects of most 
&ldquo;supplements&rdquo; are not based on specific biological activity.</p> 
<p>Regarding the &ldquo;multicomponent&rdquo; argument: do you have real 
evidence of this? I must admit that I&rsquo;ve never been interested enough in 
the woo-ery of herbalism (it&rsquo;s so prosaic compared to the really magical 
stuff) to investigate this claim, although one hears it all the time. 
It&rsquo;s not entirely implausible, in a way: many biologically-active 
molecules in plants, including some that have become medicines, appear to have 
evolved as defenses against predators (mainly insects). It is true that there 
can be more than one poison in a plant, perhaps each having conferred a 
selective advantage against the same species or similar species of insects. 
Perhaps the various poisons have additive or even synergistic effects on 
particular insects. If so, this ought to be known to legitimate botanists and 
entomologists. Any out there?</p> 
<p>Yet even if that is true, it doesn&rsquo;t follow that additive or 
synergistic medicinal effects must exist for substances found in plants that 
have useful medicinal properties for humans. Typical claims of that sort by 
&ldquo;CAM&rdquo; types betray their naivete about nature. Consider the 
following statement by the former Chief Medical Officer at the Southwest 
College of Naturopathic Medicine. It suggests &ldquo;intelligent design&rdquo; 
or some similar, comforting but childish notion that nature is our Mary Poppins:
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s nice about plant or herbal medicines<br>
 is that 
because they are derived from the whole<br>
 plant they are considerably less 
toxic to the<br>
 body. The plant medicine has evolved to work<br>
 in harmony 
with the normal body processes<br>
 rather than taking over its function as many
<br> drug therapies do. Because of this herbal medicines<br>
 may be taken for 
longer periods of time<br>
 without the side effects so often experienced<br>
 
with drugs.&rdquo; (
http://web.archive.org/web/20050825191221/http://www.scnm.edu/news/uploads/ms.pdf
 )</p> 
<p>Excuse me, but equipotent doses are equipotent, no matter what the 
packaging. And there is no reason to think that &ldquo;plant medicine has 
evolved to work in harmony with the normal (human!) bodily processes.&rdquo; 
That&rsquo;s just wishful thinking.</p> 
<p>Again, I don&rsquo;t know that there aren&rsquo;t examples of medicinal 
plants containing more than one molecule useful for the same human problem. I 
am quite sure, however, that there is no compelling reason in biology to think 
that this should be the norm, or even common.</p> </li> 
<li> # apteryx <em>on 19 Mar 2008 at 12:53 pm </em> 
<p>I&rsquo;m afraid addressing all the mistaken ideas in the above message 
would take a very lengthy response, which as Dr. Sampson would note, would be a 
distraction from the major thread. However, if your med school told you 
anything about botanicals, it should have told you that it is VERY common for 
plants to contain whole suites of structurally similar secondary metabolites, 
which may serve many purposes other than &ldquo;poisons&rdquo; &ndash; of 
course, what is a &ldquo;poison&rdquo; to a bacterium may be beneficial for us! 
Sure, some consumers assume every plant&rsquo;s virtues derive from synergistic 
or additive effects, and that is not always true. But if you get a certain 
result in a bioassay or clinical trial from a whole extract, then can&rsquo;t 
find any single molecule that has the same bioactivity profile when given in 
the same (relatively small) amount as was present in the extract, the only 
mechanist conclusion possible has to be that there is more than one active 
molecule present.</p> 
<p>To return to the proper theme, your med school should also have taught you 
not to label patients who understand that with words like 
&ldquo;woo-ery,&rdquo; &ldquo;naivete,&rdquo; and &ldquo;childish.&rdquo; You 
admit that you have little knowledge of botany or the irrelevant science of 
entomology; I hope you do not display open contempt for non-MD patients if 
their greater knowledge of botany causes them to disagree with some opinion you 
hold dear.</p> </li> 
<li> # daedalus2u <em>on 19 Mar 2008 at 2:18 pm </em> 
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how you get from my examples the possible notion that I 
suggested that consumers of non-European cuisine are in any way 
&ldquo;defective&rdquo;.</p> 
<p>Tobacco has been consumed for centuries. Is tobacco without side effects? 
Are people who choose to consume tobacco somehow &ldquo;defective&rdquo;? 
Addicted yes, addicted to an herb.</p> 
<p>The same is true with salt. Salt has been consumed by humans for forever. 
It is actually a necessary dietary component. Is consumption of salt without 
side effects? Consuming an entire retail container of salt (26 oz or 740 grams) 
would likely be fatal. In rats the LD50 is 3 g/kg.</p> 
<p>The fact is, that membership of a material in a group called 
&ldquo;herbs&rdquo; or &ldquo;chemicals&rdquo; or &ldquo;foods&rdquo; or 
&ldquo;drugs&rdquo; or &ldquo;pharmaceuticals&rdquo;, or &ldquo;white 
powders&rdquo; or &ldquo;sold in containers of lethal quantities&rdquo; tells 
us nothing about the safety or dangerousness of the material. Salt is a member 
of every one of those groups.</p> </li> 
<li> # apteryx <em>on 19 Mar 2008 at 2:49 pm </em> 
<p>Well, Daedalus, when I observed that many of the 2.5 billion Indians and 
Chinese eat ginger regularly, and yet there are 2.5 billion of them, you 
responded as follows:</p> 
<p>&ldquo;If &ldquo;everyone&rdquo; in India eats ginger during their 
pregnancy, perhaps they are all immune, or perhaps if they didn&rsquo;t eat so 
much ginger over historic time we would now be speaking Hindi because Indians 
would have industrialized first and conquered the world instead of Europeans. 
&rdquo;</p> 
<p>If you suggest in utero or in vivo exposure to ginger could possibly have 
prevented Indians from industrializing &ldquo;first,&rdquo; you imply that 
ginger consumption could possibly create some unspecified biological condition 
that prevented them from being good productive capitalists and conquistadors. 
But you probably can&rsquo;t imagine what condition, any more than I can. 
Since, excluding diseases caused by known deficiencies and pathogens, Asians 
are not known for being physically feeble and debilitated, I assume that you 
were implying ginger could have somehow mysteriously affected Indians&rsquo; 
mental faculties. (Apparently for the better, if an inability to rape and 
pillage the rest of the world is the only &ldquo;symptom.&rdquo;)</p> 
<p>A more plausible explanation of why Indians didn&rsquo;t industrialize 
first is that (a) they didn&rsquo;t have large accessible coal reserves, which 
is not causally correlated with consumption of spicy foods, and (b) they live 
in the tropics, an area historically not conducive to sweatshop labor &mdash; 
which is. Do you maybe want to back off a bit from your earlier comments?</p> 
<p>Announcing that every substance is toxic in excess is not a valuable 
revelation. Practically everyone knows that, and it tells us nothing about what 
substances are toxic under normal circumstances. One of those things that med 
students really ought to be learning [note casual segue back to original topic] 
is that when people from India and China start eating the Western diet, their 
health worsens. Instead of drumming up fear of spicy vegetables, perhaps they 
should start trying to quantify the toxic dose of grain-fed red meat.</p> </li> 
<li> # daedalus2u <em>on 19 Mar 2008 at 4:14 pm </em> 
<p>There are many more plausible reasons that Indians didn&rsquo;t conquer the 
world than because they ate too much ginger. I threw that out there as an 
attempt to be humorous, but also to make the point that even though things have 
been used for a long time doesn&rsquo;t mean they are safe.</p> 
<p>The major traditional medicine of India is Ayurveda which uses heavy metals 
(mercury, arsenic and lead) in quantities that exceed levels now considered to 
be safe.</p> 
<p>http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/abstract/292/23/2868</p> 
<p>
http://www.indianexpress.com/res/web/pIe/full_story.php?content_id=71247&amp;pn=0
</p> 
<p>The anecdotes of safe and beneficial use of Ayurveda go as far back as the 
anecdotes of the safe and beneficial use of ginger (that would be for all of 
recorded history in India).</p> 
<p>I am not trying to drum up fear of ginger, but rather an absence of 
ignorance of the pro and con effects of ginger. The only way to actually know 
something is to actually measure it. The Indian practices of Ayurveda 
reportedly were dictated by one of their gods. Not a theoretical basis that is 
subject to analysis.</p> 
<p>Should Ayurveda be taught in medical school? Should it be taught before or 
after the section on heavy metal poisoning and how to treat it?</p> </li> 
<li> # Joe <em>on 19 Mar 2008 at 5:15 pm </em> 
<p>As for the herbalist claims that herb components work together to provide 
some increased benefit (additive, or synergistic), the opposite can also be 
true- the herb can contain poisons that make the desired active-ingredient 
irrelevant until purified. Apteryx knows this as s/he reported &ldquo;Homemade 
horse chestnut products indeed are unsafe. Commercial products are made with 
specific techniques to remove the toxic compounds&rdquo; BTW, Apteryx also 
noted &ldquo;Commercial products should be standardized to 50 mg of aescin and 
free from aesculin, a hydroxycoumarin.&rdquo; There&rsquo;s that word 
&ldquo;should&rdquo; which does not guarantee they &ldquo;are.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Going back to whether herbs have components that work together. Artemisia 
annua has at least seven antimalarial compounds; but artemisinin is 1,000 times 
more potent than the next best (&ldquo;Traditional Medicinal Plants and 
Malaria&rdquo; M. Willocox, et al Eds. (CRC Press, 2004)). In a related note 
concerning herbal medicine, more than 100 &ldquo;antimalarial&rdquo; Chinese 
herbs were screened and only Artemesia had useful activity
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16722826?ordinalpos=21&amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum
 .</p> 
<p>There is also the example of foxglove. It provides at least two drugs 
(digoxin and digitoxin) with similar action; but very different pharmacological 
profiles. Offhand, I find that &ldquo;Hospitalized elderly patients taking 
digitoxin had a lower rate of toxicity than those taking digoxin.&rdquo;

<p>apteryx, you misconstrued what I wrote, possibly because I did not make 
myself clear. By &ldquo;woo-ery,&rdquo; I was referring to the woo aspects of 
herbalism, which does not mean that there are not non-woo aspects, namely, 
investigating folk uses to find useful medicinal substances in plants&mdash;as 
I thought I had made clear from previous examples. By &ldquo;woo-ery&rdquo; I 
was referring to ideas such as those in the quotation from the naturopath, 
which are childish, naive, and do not reflect an understanding of anything. I 
was not charging you or any particular, hypothetical patient with similar 
notions.</p> 
<p>I&rsquo;m sure you can also appreciate that some of the critical, 
uncompromising language used on this blog is not the sort that most MDs would 
throw at a patient who has approached us in good faith, however much we may 
disagree with his or her point of view. Professionalism in medicine, as in any 
other &ldquo;helping&rdquo; profession, is more compassionate and subtle than 
that.</p> 
<p>Yes, it&rsquo;s plausible to &ldquo;get a certain result in a bioassay or 
clinical trial from a whole extract, [without] any single molecule that has the 
same bioactivity profile when given in the same (relatively small) amount as 
was present in the extract.&rdquo; And yes, if that were common it would make 
herbalism more intriguing to science-based MDs. But show us examples, please. 
That&rsquo;s the big question, so far unanswered, at least in this thread. Joe 
mentioned Varro Tyler, one of the few legitimate academics in the field, who 
did not agree with it (see &ldquo;tenet #3&Prime; here:
http://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/paraherbalism.html ).</p> 
<p>Entomology, by the way, is far from irrelevant to that very question. If 
widespread synergy of bio-active molecules in plants really exists, it&rsquo;s 
likely that it will have already been discovered by entomologists and/or 
botanists (readers: help us out here, please). If so, even if their discoveries 
have only to do with substances poisonous to insects, it would provide a 
theoretical boost to the synergy claim for medicinal properties&mdash;even 
though the latter are fortuitous, existing only because biochemistry itself is 
similar throughout the living world. In the case of plants and insects, the 
phenomena are based on more than that: selection pressures imposed by each on 
the other over hundreds of millions of years.</p>

<p>There are quite a few plants whose activity has been found to split into

EGCG is the only one that&rsquo;s very potent directly (e.g., against cancer), 
the presence of related compounds boosts its activity. Here are the only

<p>Both flavonoids and procyanidins are relevant to hawthorn&rsquo;s 
cardiovascular benefits. No, researchers have not done separate failed clinical 
trials with every single one of those compounds &ndash; that would be 
impossible as well as foolish &ndash; but they have done lab studies showing 
that different groups of compounds contribute to bioactivity. Animal studies 
suggest that both rutin and hyperforin are necessary for St. John&rsquo;s wort 
to be active. Ginseng has dozens of ginsenosides having different activities in 
lab studies. The average plant has hundreds of secondary metabolites, often in 
groups of closely related compounds. It costs the plant something, 
metabolically, to make twenty saponins or alkaloids rather than just one. I 
think any botanist or entomologist would agree that there has to be some 
selective advantage to doing so.</p> 
<p>I would not take health advice from a botanist either [unless it was Jim 
Duke!] although that would be better than taking it from an entomologist. Varro 
Tyler was a pharmacologist, not a botanist, and he was considered by herbalists 
to be very conservative. But where scientific studies supported herbs, he was 
willing to acknowledge the facts. He deserves credit for that, not insult.</p>

<p>apteryx wrote &ldquo;There are quite a few plants whose activity has been

fractionation.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>I think we have agreed that this can happen, if it were a general 
principle, we would know it. Also, we know how to recombine fractions to 
home-in on the best activity. To the extent that an herb has activity, it is a 
contaminated drug. Those contaminants vary according to where and when you 
harvest the herb.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m sure some herbal remedies do contain more than one active 
ingredient. That is not what is being claimed by some herbalists &ndash; they 
are claiming a synergism where the joint effect is greater than the added 
effect of the individual components. Whatever the active components, the 
remedies will always contain other, inactive components, and these might be 
either useless or counterproductive, harmless or harmful.</p> 
<p>As a general principle, if an effective herbal remedy is found, its safety 
and effectiveness are likely to be improved by purification and isolation of 
active components. Aspirin is preferable to willow tree bark and digitalis to 
foxglove. Some herbalists try to tell us the opposite is true, but the evidence 
doesn&rsquo;t support them.</p> </li> 
<li> # apteryx <em>on 20 Mar 2008 at 1:38 pm </em> 
<p>Then perhaps Big Pharma would do us the favor of filling in a few gaps in 
their armamentarium by manufacturing:<br>
 - a single compound derived from 
hawthorn to alleviate symptoms of heart failure while reducing, rather than 
increasing, the risk of arrhythmias<br>
 - a single hepatoprotective compound 
derived from milk thistle (MDs who do not wish to risk malpractice suits 
already treat amanita poisoning with silymarin, which is a standardized mixture 
of four active molecules &ndash; you can find reports on PubMed)<br>
 - a 
single compound derived from horse chestnut to treat chronic venous 
insufficiency<br>
 - a single compound derived from gotu kola to speed wound 
healing and treat microangiopathy, and<br>
 - a single compound derived from 
elderberry to fight flu.<br>
 And it would be nice if in every case, their 
molecule was significantly more potent without having serious side effects, or 
equally potent without any more side effects or greatly increased cost. If 
it&rsquo;s that easy to find &ldquo;THE&rdquo; active ingredient and 
concentrate it without losing benefits or creating hazards, there&rsquo;s a lot 
of money to be made; why don&rsquo;t they get cracking?</p> 
<p>I said I wasn&rsquo;t going to waste further time responding to Joe&rsquo;s 
posts, but for the benefit of any readers who do not know what pharmacognosy 
is, it is the pharmacological study of botanicals or other natural products. It 
used to focus on whole plants, but now spends most of its time pursuing 
pharmacological studies of active molecules of interest. It is a subdiscipline 
of pharmacy, not botany. The late Dr. Tyler studied pharmacy at the University 
of Nebraska, was in 1953 the first person to receive a Ph.D. in pharmacy from 
the University of Connecticut, and spent most of his career at Purdue&rsquo;s 
&ldquo;Department of Pharmacy and Pharmacal Sciences,&rdquo; of which he was 
for some years the dean. Tyler took a conservative position, for example 
arguing that willow bark could not work as an analgesic (despite its use on 
three continents) because the dose of pure salicin was small relative to the 
maximum permitted dose of aspirin. (This was before any clinical trial of 
willow bark had been done.) He had very little if any interest in human use 
data; he was a pure scientist. Sadly, sometimes the science supports 
traditional practices.</p> </li> 
<li> # Harriet Hall <em>on 20 Mar 2008 at 2:43 pm </em> 
<p>&ldquo;there&rsquo;s a lot of money to be made; why don&rsquo;t they get 
cracking?&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Why don&rsquo;t you ask that of someone in the industry who is in the know? 
Perhaps it is because they have looked at these plants and decided that the 
evidence isn&rsquo;t promising enough to make it a good business proposition.
</p> 
<p>Big Pharma does develop drugs from plants and folk remedies. Why do you 
think they developed aspirin and Digitalis? How do you think they choose which 
plants to investigate?</p> 
<p>A drug company recently tried to develop a pharmaceutical version of 
Hoodia, but they gave up when they were unable to separate out a hepatotoxic 
component.</p> </li> 
<li> # apteryx <em>on 20 Mar 2008 at 3:39 pm </em> 
<p>How do you know that hepatotoxicity was the real problem? AFAIK, no 
published data support that. There is no evidence that the plant as 
traditionally used is hepatotoxic, so if the active molecule when concentrated 
were hepatotoxic, it might be a case where the drug model reduced safety. 
(IMHO, the real problem with Hoodia products is that most of them are fake.)</p>
<p>If the drug companies think the &ldquo;evidence isn&rsquo;t promising 
enough&rdquo; to justify investigation of those botanical uses I mentioned 
&ndash; most supported by multiple clinical trials and multiple animal studies 
and, in some, in vitro explorations of mechanism &ndash; even though none of 
their magic-bullet drugs can offer the same bioactivity profiles, then it is 
entirely rational for consumers who could benefit from those bioactivities to 
go on using the plants as people have done for millennia. You can comfort 
yourself with the belief that each has only one active molecule and that 
putting that molecule in a pill would be even better. Since there is no such 
pill, consumers will reasonably conclude that some benefit from herbs is better 
than zero benefit from Big Pharma.</p> </li>

<li> # David J Kroll <em>on 20 Mar 2008 at 5:33 pm </em> 
<p>A colleague suggested that I come by to this discussion because I have 
spent much of my 15 yrs of independent research on natural products and herbal 
medicine. Apteryx does indeed seem to know a lot about my field although 
I&rsquo;d be happy to help tone things down and add some clarity as I feel I am 
a stakeholder in natural products research in prescription medicine as well as 
in the more intellectually-accessible end of the spectrum of so-called 
complementary and alternative medicine &ndash; in fact, some natural products 
researchers are a bit miffed that their decades of legitimate work has been 
co-opted by purveyors of fraudulent and deceptive CAM modalities at the other 
ends of the spectrum.</p> 
<p>It may interest apteryx that I had the bittersweet honor of stepping in for 
Varro Tyler at a symposium held in 2001 a month after his untimely death and 
that my current research is actually on pure components in milk thistle (just 
do a PubMed search for me; however, I study their anticancer action rather than 
their hepatoprotective action). I am simply fascinated by the promise of herbal 
mixtures and their components as a source of novel chemistries that have 
allowed us to find new mechanisms of action to treat diseases.</p> 
<p>Given my background, I have never really viewed this area with the degree 
of conflict or confrontation evident in this comment thread. Indeed, there are 
a few limited cases where synergy among herbal components might support the 
superior action of a whole herb &ndash; my favorite case is the work of Frank 
Stermitz at CSU in the PNAS report cited by apteryx above. (In this case, the 
synergy is more accurately defined as &ldquo;potentiation&rdquo; since the 
antimicrobial efficacy of berberine is enhanced by the presence of the S. 
aureus NorA efflux pump inhibitor, 5-methoxyhydnocarpin &ndash; this compound 
has no intrinsic antimicrobial activity so the effect can be described by the 
analogy of 1 + 0 = 3.)</p> 
<p>I&rsquo;ve also been involved in several NIH/NCI-funded projects over the 
last six years where my pharmacognosy and med chem colleagues have fractionated 
plant extracts that we have then tested for in vitro cytotoxic activity against 
human cancer cell lines. I&rsquo;m sorry to say that out of ~4,000 extracts 
with which my lab has worked, we have yet to find a single case where synergy 
might be present. In the vast majority of cases, fractionation of plant 
extracts leads to an enrichment of cytotoxic activity (not a loss as might be 
expected if there were synergistic components) that can then be narrowed down 
to a single pure compound or related pure compounds. At the very best, we have 
seen nothing more than additive action among compounds where more than one was 
present in the extract.</p> 
<p>A common herbalist stance is that whole plants have fewer side effects than 
pure compounds because the plant contains other compounds that offset the side 
effects of the active constituent. Despite my willingness to consider this 
claim and a search of the scientific literature, there is unfortunately no 
evidence I can identify to support this claim.</p> 
<p>I can certainly identify with apteryx&rsquo;s enthusiasm for wanting drug 
companies to isolate and market the pure compounds from herbal products that 
have some reported potential for biological activity. In fact, they already do 
but mostly as semi-synthetic analogs of the naturally-occurring compounds to 
overcome metabolism and solubility issues (and the patentability issues 
detailed below). We are trying to do that now with milk thistle compounds but 
the reality is that the pure, naturally-occurring compounds cannot be patented 
and lack of a protected IP position provides no financial incentive for the 
average $800 million investment required to bring a drug to market in the US. 
Taxol, the anticancer drug whose structure was solved by one of my current 
senior colleagues, is a special story of a natural compound that made it to the 
prescription drug market because the process to synthesize it from a renewable 
resource was patented, not the molecule itself.</p> 
<p>Although 25% of our current prescription drugs can be traced to molecules 
from natural sources, corporate investment in natural products drug discovery 
has diminished leaving much of the work to government-funded academic 
researchers. (Of course, drug companies might be happy to license a novel 
natural product derivative if you had a clear IP position and significant 
preclinical and early clinical data supporting safety and efficacy). Each of 
the projects described above by apteryx would take several, R01-sized NIH 
grants to accomplish. As a scientist with the training and willingness to 
investigate these questions, I can only hope that enough interest (i.e., 
funding) remains in the promise of this field for such questions to be 
addressed.</p> </li> 
<li> # Harriet Hall <em>on 20 Mar 2008 at 6:28 pm </em> 
<p>&ldquo;it is entirely rational for consumers who could benefit from those 
bioactivities to go on using the plants as people have done for millennia&rdquo;
</p> 
<p>It is rational to some extent. It depends on one&rsquo;s risk-taking 
propensities. Because of the DSHEA, I can&rsquo;t trust the purity and dosage 
of what&rsquo;s being sold. I keep reading about contaminants and inconsistent 
dosages.</p> 
<p>And I reject the argument that a plant-based remedy is safe just because 
people have used it for centuries without noticing any problems. No one was 
keeping statistics during those centuries. Think of HRT (hormone replacement 
therapy). It was used for decades by huge numbers of women before the 
Women&rsquo;s Health Initiative finally convinced us it did more harm than 
good. One of those &ldquo;benign&rdquo; herbal remedies might just turn out to 
be fatal for the occasional patient; we just don&rsquo;t know.</p> 
<p>Effective herbal remedies are drugs just as much as prescription drugs are. 
I would hesitate to take a prescription drug that had not been extensively 
tested. I prefer not to use new prescription drugs until there has been time 
for post-marketing surveillance to pick up unexpected problems. I think the 
testing for most herbal remedies has generally been inferior to the testing for 
prescription drugs.</p> </li> 
<li> # apteryx <em>on 21 Mar 2008 at 10:37 am </em> 
<p>Dr. Kroll -<br>
 Thanks for your very interesting remarks! I think that you 
are more likely to find single compounds effective in a cytotoxicity assay. 
That&rsquo;s a very simple bioactivity. You&rsquo;re simply looking for 
compounds that are, frankly, poisonous in isolation, and enough of any 
poisonous compound will kill cells by itself. However, in a plant like hawthorn 
it appears that both flavonoids and procyanidins have beneficial bioactivities, 
and that multiple compounds in each class are bioactive, so you are not likely 
to be able to fish out one molecule and get the same complex in vivo activity 
profile.</p> 
<p>Also, in nature the presence of multiple antipathogenic compounds probably 
has the advantage of delaying the evolution of resistance. We only use an 
antibiotic or pesticide for a few decades before seeing major resistance, 
whereas plants seem to get by for millennia. (Likewise, Peruvians used quinine 
bark effectively for malaria for a long time, but once Europeans started using 
isolated quinine, resistance developed in less than a century.) We are now 
starting to push multidrug malaria treatments for that very reason. Maybe we 
should have been emulating the plants all along and using multiple compounds.
</p> 
<p>I do have a question; you say &ldquo;In the vast majority of cases, 
fractionation of plant extracts leads to an enrichment of cytotoxic 
activity.&rdquo; That could mean either that the concentrated fraction is more 
toxic than the crude extract when given in equal volumes (which means that a 
far higher quantity of the toxic molecule(s) is present), or that the 
concentrated fraction is more toxic than the crude extract when given at a much 
lower dose, so that the dose of the toxic molecule(s) is identical. In the 
former case, it&rsquo;s not a surprise that higher dose means more toxicity. In 
the latter case, it actually implies that other molecules in the crude extract 
interfere with the toxicity of the &ldquo;active molecule,&rdquo; which is 
supporting evidence for the idea that whole plants may be less toxic because 
they contain multiple compounds with opposing effects. (Real life example: 
ginseng contains individual ginsenosides that both raise and lower blood 
pressure in animal studies, but as a whole extract tends to lower blood 
pressure.)</p> </li>

<p>&ldquo;I am simply fascinated by the promise of herbal mixtures and their 
components as a source of novel chemistries that have allowed us to find new 
mechanisms of action to treat diseases.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>That&rsquo;s really the point, isn&rsquo;t it? The non-woo view of herbs as 
potential medicines.</p> </li> 
<li> # David Gorski <em>on 21 Mar 2008 at 2:59 pm </em> 
<p>Indeed it is.</p> 
<p>However, one thing about the &ldquo;CAM&rdquo; movement is that it tends 
not to e interested in the hard, involved science necessary to identify the 
active compound(s) in the herbs and how they may act and interact. Rather, its 
advocates have a distressing tendency to simply assume that because a remedy is 
an herb or part of a plant it must be better than pharmaceutical products, even 
herb- or plant-derived drugs, because it&rsquo;s &ldquo;natural.&rdquo;</p> 
</li> 
<li> # apteryx <em>on 21 Mar 2008 at 3:39 pm </em> 
<p>I don&rsquo;t assume that willow bark is better than aspirin, opium is 
better than codeine, or artemisia is better than artemisinin (if you can afford 
the drug and, where it is prescription-only, gain an MD&rsquo;s permission to 
obtain it). However, I do assume that hawthorn is better than a NONEXISTENT 
drug derived therefrom. Some proven benefit is better than no benefit. I also 
think that if a manufacturer did make a single-compound drug from a complex 
botanical, it should be their job to demonstrate that it is better than the 
plant it came from, rather than asking us all just to &ldquo;simply 
assume&rdquo; that the brand new corporate product is superior.</p> 
<p>I, for one, am very interested in the &ldquo;hard, involved science&rdquo; 
that is used to demonstrate these plants&rsquo; bioactivities, whether or not 
the studies of bioactivity identify single active compounds. Lab studies 
supporting traditional uses are great to see, because animals and isolated 
cells can&rsquo;t be accused of experiencing placebo effects! Animal studied 
and in vitro mechanism studies are hard and involved, indeed, but I hope you 
don&rsquo;t mean to imply that if they can&rsquo;t completely explicate all 
mechanisms of action, they will never be &ldquo;hard&rdquo; enough to satisfy.
