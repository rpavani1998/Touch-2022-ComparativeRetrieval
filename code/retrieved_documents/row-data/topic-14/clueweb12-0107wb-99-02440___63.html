<br>

<p><i>In her 40s, married with 2 children. A rather well-off family, they paid 
about &pound;460 a month on rent. Husband was in his late 40s.</i></p> 
<p><i>Although she said that she was very quiet, she seemed to be very relaxed 
and willing to share her views. She studied a master degree in subject and was 
in a profession before. However she quit her job when her children were born. 
Housework seemed to be her main source of stress. She had very rather high 
expectations on her children, their study, appearance, and herself (including 
her English and her homemaking). I came to her place, a bungalow in {location}, 
which is immaculate clean and tidy. She may have spent a lot of time on tidying 
the house. There seems to be a clear division of labour at home. Husband just 
concentrates on his study and the wife is responsible for everything related to 
the whole family.</i></p> 
<p><i>Although she told me that she was now very happy and satisfied with her 
life here, there seemed to be a time that she had great difficulties (the first 
year when she came). Her health conditions, such {medical condition} might be a 
reason</i> .</p> 
<p><b>I: How long have you been here? </b></p> 
<p>F: Nearly four years </p> 
<p><b>I: Nearly four years. You are -- (she started to laugh) relax, it is 
alright (laugh). Just ignore it (the recorder) (laugh)... You are from Taiwan?
</b></p> 
<p>F: Yes, I come from Taiwan. </p> 
<p><b>I: What is your aim in coming here? </b></p> 
<p>F: My husband came here to study for a {qualification}, so we came along 
too.</p> 
<p><b>I: Did you come here with your husband, or did your husband come over 
here on his own first?</b></p> 
<p>F: We came here together. </p> 
<p><b>I: Came here together. How do you find the life here? </b></p> 
<p>F: It is alright. I found it quite hard when I first came here, but it is 
getting better now.</p> 
<p><b>I: Why did you find it hard? Why? </b></p> 
<p>F: No friends. </p> 
<p><b>I: But there are a lot of Taiwanese here. </b></p> 
<p>F: Taiwanese -- we did not know many of them, because the place where we 
used to live was not close to the university, therefore we did not have much 
connection. Even though there were some Taiwanese students, they came here to 
study, also they were..., that is, that is not the same. Of course we have some 
friends, that is, that is every family has its own problems. Yes, we have some 
contacts, but that is not as easy as it is in Taiwan.</p> 
<p><b>I: Then what do you feel now? </b></p> 
<p>F: It is better now. Now I know how to get on with my life (laugh). </p> 
<p><b>I: Do you still have any problems in adjusting now? </b></p> 
<p>F: It is better now. It is mainly because the weather, now you know what to 
wear for different weather. When we first came here, I felt the English people 
were very reserved. There are some things which we Chinese ... they were very 
polite, they said things very formally, otherwise they think you are rude. When 
I first came here, I did not know about that. Now we know they emphasise that, 
otherwise you are like a barbarian. That is something like that. I don't know 
whether you have the same feeling?</p> 
<p><b>I: Yes, yes, I have the same feeling too. I don't like it. </b></p> 
<p>F: Yes, now if I hear that, for example, someone has just come over to this 
country, and they are talking with foreigners, I will tell them, I will tell 
them if you say it in this way, the hearer will think you are very rude. They 
don't know how to say it formally. Because we attended the class and our 
friends told us that the English people like that, you should say it in that 
way. Also after hearing that for many times, you know how to talk with them in 
a way that is polite. That is why it is better now.</p> 
<p><b>I: So you understand it now. </b></p> 
<p>F: Yes, yes. But sometimes I still make some mistakes (laugh). </p> 
<p><b>I: You said earlier that it was hard when you first came here - the main 
reason is what?</b></p> 
<p>F: That is, that is the language problem. Also because of my husband's 
study. Because they had to study for a master's degree in their first year. 
Then he did not pass, he could not carry on to do a {qualification}. Although 
he had a {qualification} already, it was not useful because it was not 
recognised here. Their department is very tough, they needed to attend the 
classes, to do the course work, and also to take exams for many subjects.</p> 
<p><b>I: How about your children? </b></p> 
<p>F: They are alright. There is a lot of homework, but not so hard, they are 
catching up gradually.</p> 
<p><b>I: Did your family come over to see you? </b></p> 
<p>F: Yes, they did. We also have regular contacts. That is not too bad. </p> 
<p><b>I: But do you prefer it if they are close to you or not? </b></p> 
<p>F: Good or bad, it depends. You know we Chinese people are like that. You 
have a family and then you have some friends. If you have some friends it means 
that there will be some problems and gossip. I don't know how to say it in 
English.</p> 
<p><b>I: Yes.... </b></p> 
<p>F: I think I think it is the same here. </p> 
<p><b>I: Yes. </b></p> 
<p>F: It is the same here. Of course, relations can help. If you have 
relations, you can contact them sometimes. But then there may be some troubles. 
So it can be good or bad, it is difficult to say.</p> 
<p><b>I: What do you think about here? </b></p> 
<p>F: Here, I like the fresher air here. </p> 
<p><b>I: Fresher air. </b></p> 
<p>F: Fresher air. Also, it is very democratic here. In Taiwan, we shouted for 
democracy for a long time, said how we Chinese people should be, it was all the 
talk. When we came here and saw what it should be like. I came at the time when 
Tony Blair won, then he came to power immediately. And the next day, the whole 
government changed. If that is for we Chinese, it must be at least a few months 
for the transition. But here the new people took up the job the next day. There 
was no problem. I found that they are really very democratic.</p> 
<p><b>I: Did you work before you came here? </b></p> 
<p>F: At the very beginning I worked. But I quit the job later when my husband 
went to {European country}. We stayed there for three years and then we went 
back to Taiwan. I gave birth to a baby [babies] in {European country}. I did 
not work again. I have not worked since I came here.</p> 
<p><b>I: You haven't worked for a long time. </b></p> 
<p>F: Haven't worked for a long time, yes. </p> 
<p><b>I: You prefer working or not? </b></p> 
<p>F: At that time, I preferred working. But later I found some advantages in 
not working. There are some advantages in working too. But now it is not easy 
to find a job. I have children to look after, for example, to get a job during 
the time when the children go to school. It is difficult to get a job here.</p> 
<p><b>I: But my previous flatmates from Taiwan, they were able to get some 
part time jobs. Have you tried?</b></p> 
<p>F: I thought of trying. I talked about that with my husband. But later I 
found that when I was not at home, my husband would read books in his room and 
our children would watch television or do something else in the living room. 
Even when I went to do the shopping and came back late, they would act as if I 
was not there. When I came back, they would rush to turn off the television. So 
I wonder whether I should work or do something. Also, it is not easy to get a 
job. What you can get are those low class jobs -- such as a cleaner or 
something like that. Then I decided to leave it. I prefer to look after my two 
children well, because my husband does not care about this. Although I have 
thought of it, I finally decided not to. So I did not try.</p> 
<p><b>I: But how your husband, does he like you to work? </b></p> 
<p>F: Not bad. He does not say that I must work. He said it is more important 
to take care of everything at home. That is the main aim of why we came here 
together. Otherwise we would have been better off not coming and just letting 
my husband come over here on his own.</p> 
<p><b>I: Yes. My sister told me that being a housewife is very demanding, very 
hard.</b></p> 
<p>F: Yes, it is very hard. Because you think that you are not working and you 
are supposed to look after the children and the home well. It is hard.</p> 
<p><b>I: Do you have many friends here now? </b></p> 
<p>F: Now we have some friends here, but they have their own private affairs. 
I am very friendly with our neighbour -- she is nearly 88 years old.</p> 
<p><b>I: What sort of person is she? </b></p> 
<p>F: She is a widow. She is on her own. We are neighbours. Our neighbours 
here are quite friendly. But sometimes I find my English is not very good, so I 
am not very close to them. But it is better with the old lady, because she is 
quite old and also she is a bit forgetful. She is quite kind. In this area, 
here in {British location}, most of our neighbours are quite old. They stay in 
their bungalows and seldom move. Those neighbours are quite good, but -- I 
don't know-- maybe that is my personality -- not so open. My husband always 
says that I should go out to know more people, but I think I am not good at 
communicating with people.</p> 
<p><b>I: No. </b></p> 
<p>F: I am not good at communicating with people. My husband's English is also 
not very good, but he is very good at chatting with other people. I can't. If 
there is no topic, I will have nothing to say. I will then sit there and not 
know what to do. That may be because of my personality. So I am not very 
familiar with them.</p> 
<p><b>I: But were you the same in Taiwan? </b></p> 
<p>F: In Taiwan, I did not have many friends, only a few. Because I think if 
we can get along, we are friends. If not, I don't want to waste my time. I 
don't want to pretend to be friendly.</p> 
<p><b>I: Do you have Taiwanese friends here? </b></p> 
<p>F: I have some, but I met them here after I came to this country. I am 
quite friendly with a few of them, but some of them have left already.</p> 
<p><b>I: Earlier you said if you didn't feel well, you would go and see the 
doctor?</b></p> 
<p>F: Yes, if I didn't feel well, I would go and see the doctor. </p> 
<p><b>I: Do you have any difficulties when you go to see the doctor, and is it 
convenient?</b></p> 
<p>F: What do you mean by &quot;difficulties&quot;? </p> 
<p><b>I: Because some women have told me that they have language problems. 
Sometimes, the doctors don't understand them.</b></p> 
<p>F: Before I went to see a doctor, if I didn't know how to describe my 
symptoms, I would look them up in a dictionary beforehand and try to memorise 
the words. The doctors said -- sometimes, if they used spoken English which I 
didn't understand, I would ask them to clarify what they had said. I would ask 
them what it meant. They said &quot;off-colour&quot;. What is 
&quot;off-colour&quot;? I didn't understand the meaning. It means a bit like 
&quot;ill&quot;. I would ask them. Sometimes, I would ask them to write it down 
for me. But I could not read it, because their handwriting is very sloppy. Very 
sloppy, so I gave up. Anyway, I took the medicine.</p> 
<p><b>I: Are they helpful? </b></p> 
<p>F: Yes, they are. </p> 
<p><b>I: They are quite good? </b></p> 
<p>F: I feel it is alright, not bad. But of course some doctors are not as 
good as others. You just have to see if you are lucky. After visiting them for 
a few times, you know which ones are good and will try to stick with them. I 
believe there are some good doctors and some bad doctors; it is not possible 
that all of them are good. People usually try to see the good doctors, 
therefore if there is an emergency, you may not be able to make an appointment 
with them. It is impossible and you have to wait, that is the down side of it. 
I feel that things are always like this.</p> 
<p><b>I: What do think the reasons for this? </b></p> 
<p>F: This behaviour is not just to the foreigners, he is a bit unkind. For 
example, some doctors will talk a lot with you, but some just ask how you are 
and then you come out very quickly.</p> 
<p><b>I: Do you feel any cultural difference between you and them? </b></p> 
<p>F: Cultural difference, yes, but it is not just between you and the 
doctors. We have cultural differences with all the English people. We have 
different viewpoints on different things. For example, we Chinese are not the 
same as them -- we are very courteous to our visitors -- &quot;Please come in 
and take a seat&quot; -- unlike our neighbours; if you chatted with them at 
their front doors for half an hour, 45 mins, or even an hour, they still would 
not invite you to go inside. I felt my legs were very sore, I told them that I 
was very tired, but they did not stop talking. You stood there and they stood 
there too -- I found it so strange. Later, I realise that those foreigners, 
they usually won't invite you inside their houses. Now I've learned how to deal 
with it -- I also may not invite them into my house. Also, sometimes when they 
come, our house may be a bit messy, then I may just chat with them outside the 
house for 10 mins or 15 mins. I don't know, they are like that, they won't 
invite you inside and offer you a cup of tea. The English people are like this.
</p> 
<p><b>I: Yes, some of them are more reserved. </b></p> 
<p>F: Yes. Of course, some of them are nice. But most of them are like that. 
But our opposite neighbour, she is very nice, very nice. Maybe they just get 
use to being like that. So I feel -- it is something like this. This is why 
many foreigners visit Taiwan and have the impression that Chinese people are 
very warm-hearted. This is why.</p> 
<p><b>I: (laugh) Have you ever visited a Chinese doctor here? </b></p> 
<p>F: Yes, once. </p> 
<p><b>I: Once, how did you like it? </b></p> 
<p>F: I threw the medicine away before I finished it (laugh). </p> 
<p><b>I: (laugh) Why? </b></p> 
<p>F: I don't know. The medicine was expensive and the cost was not covered by 
the NHS, I paid for it myself. I saw the doctor once and took a long time to 
boil the medicine. I did not drink it. The rest of the medicine was left 
untouched. And then last summer I visited my sister. She brought me to see a 
Chinese doctor there -- they have a Chinese doctor there. What he (she) said 
was not the same as the other doctor.</p> 
<p><b>I: Not the same? </b></p> 
<p>F: Because he (she) felt my pulse -- I feel that some parts of my body have 
some problems. What they said are not the same, I don't know. That is it.... I 
need some exercise, it is related to exercise. Your mental condition affects 
your physical condition. If you are mentally healthy, you will have no 
problems. If there are some problems with your mental health, then nothing will 
be alright. I feel they are related.</p> 
<p><b>I: But what medicine do you prefer? </b></p> 
<p>F: you mean Chinese medicine? </p> 
<p><b>I: Yes, yes. </b></p> 
<p>F: It is difficult to say. We Chinese people say that for acute illness, 
consult a Western doctor; for chronic illness, see a Chinese doctor (laugh). Do 
you know what I mean?</p> 
<p><b>I: (laugh) Yes. </b></p> 
<p>F: Yes, that's it. If a Western doctor can do nothing, then you need to see 
a Chinese doctor. But there are many cases in Taiwan when Chinese medicine 
killed the patients. Of course, there are some good Chinese doctors, but you 
have to get to the right person. Some are not good and waste your time.</p> 
<p><b>I: Why did you go to see a Chinese doctor at that time? Is it because 
the GP could not help?</b></p> 
<p>F: It was not mainly because -- it was not because they could not help -- 
like, how do you say it, there are some women's illness diseases, western 
doctors cannot diagnose them. They cannot. I went to see them and they said it 
was normal. They are like that. But Chinese medicine can help, like we Chinese 
say what sorts of things are &quot;cold&quot; and what sorts of things are 
&quot;hot&quot;, isn't it? You eat &quot;pai choi&quot;, you will have a lot of 
discharges, that is normal. I don't know whether you understand.</p> 
<p><b>I: I also have similar belief. </b></p> 
<p>F: But western doctors don't have this concept. Every time I ate &quot;pai 
choi&quot;, I would have a noticeable reaction to it immediately. The western 
doctors said it was normal. But Chinese doctors know about the difference. They 
are different. I went to see Chinese doctors in Taiwan sometimes, I drank the 
medicine too. The biggest difference between western medicine and Chinese 
medicine is that, for western medicine, you will see the result in a few days, 
but for Chinese medicine, it may take a few months, you have to wait. So I 
really don't know which of them is more effective. Generally, western medicine 
is effective, but people say drugs are not good.</p> 
<p><b>I: This is one of the reasons of this project. Most of the foreigners 
think we Chinese, most of us, will go to see Chinese doctors when we fall ill 
and don't go to see the GPs. That is why the usage of the NHS -- the statistics 
are so low. That is why we want to find out the reasons. They wonder whether 
most of the Chinese people prefer to see Chinese doctors.</b></p> 
<p>F: You wonder whether it is because of the language problem? I don't know, 
I don't know whether those people you are interviewing know English. I think -- 
are you wondering if those old people who came to this country earlier may not 
speak English and they may have this problem. There is -- but, because, I have 
a friend who works in the Chinese medicine centre, on Saturday, they have a lot 
of foreign patients -- some of them are old men or old ladies. They have a lot 
of foreign patients.</p> 
<p><b>I: Yes, I was told that most of them are foreigners, they are not 
Chinese.</b></p> 
<p>F: Not Chinese. </p> 
<p><b>I: Yes. That is why we were surprised. Because we thought most of the 
patients were Chinese, but it was not so.</b></p> 
<p>F: I found it very expensive. A bag of medicine costs &pound;5, very 
expensive, it is very expensive. We here -- medicine -- see &pound;5 can last 
-- I found it very expensive.</p> 
<p><b>I: You mentioned about most of the problems related to mental and 
physical...</b></p> 
<p>F: Yes, mental and physical, I think they are closely linked. When I first 
came here, I was not familiar with the environment, I had no friends and also I 
felt the pressure, I felt very tired, really. I wanted to see a doctor, but 
didn't know who to go to. Also the doctors, like what I said, the English 
people -- they said something very formally -- &quot;How are you&quot;, 
&quot;fine&quot; -- just something like this. We went to the class and our 
teacher told us that if an English people asks &quot;How are you&quot;, you 
must answer &quot;fine&quot;, don't say, don't say you have any problems, they 
won't be prepared to listen to you.</p> 
<p><b>I: Yes? </b></p> 
<p>F: When you have a headache, don't mention it, talk to your doctor about 
the problem, don't mention it to other people. And when I asked the teacher how 
to answer, he (she) said to say &quot;not bad&quot;, then they would not carry 
on asking about the problems. They won't ask what part of your body is not 
well. That is the difference -- we are very warm-hearted, we are like this. But 
now I know about it, before that I was a bit stupid and didn't understand that, 
and also no one taught me about that. So now I see some friends -- not from 
Taiwan, friends from other countries, whom I met mainly in the English class, I 
see them making the same mistakes as I did. But they are going home soon, so 
they don't care.</p> 
<p><b>I: The class seems to be quite useful. It teaches you many things. </b>
</p> 
<p>F: We learned it bit by bit. The course is grade number. The teacher has 
taught a lot of foreigners. He (she) has a Chinese student, who is a man and is 
quite old. He was absent for a few days and did not attend the class for a few 
days. And then when he came back to the class, the teacher asked him what 
happened and why he had not been attending the class. Probably the teacher 
asked the question quite casually. But then this Chinese man replied that he 
had been passing some black excrement (laugh).</p> 
<p><b>I: (laugh) </b></p> 
<p>F: The teacher said &quot;Oh! Oh!&quot;. He (she) asked why he said that. 
But that was what he (she) had asked about. He (she) did not think so. Then he 
(she) decided to give us a lesson on the cultural difference. He (she) said we 
English people did not listen to something like this -- how could you mention 
something like this so casually. But we think that if you ask me, then I should 
tell you. Because you asked me, so I will tell you. That is quite interesting.
</p> 
<p><b>I: But how about yourself, you have been in this country for four years. 
During which period have you felt happier?</b></p> 
<p>F: When I saw that my children were looked after well (laugh). </p> 
<p><b>I: (laugh) </b></p> 
<p>F: Yes. I find the countryside here very beautiful. Sometimes a trip out is 
quite good. But I don't like going out so much. It is because before we have a 
trip out, I have to do the packing. And then when we come back, I need to do a 
lot of laundry. Do you understand? My husband organised the trip and then when 
we were back, I had to do the washing. Our children, they enjoyed it very much. 
And they came back, I had to do the work. I felt very exhausted.</p> 
<p><b>I: (laugh) So you don't go out? </b></p> 
<p>F: No, we still go out. I just don't want to be out for so many days. If we 
go out for many days, I will feel very exhausted. My husband is a serious 
person. We travelled on the train -- a few years ago -- about two years ago -- 
at that time our children were still quite young -- we did not have a car, we 
travelled by trains. Our children were playing on the train and then my husband 
said &quot;Look! You foreigners are making a loud noise on the train. That is 
not good&quot;. I said &quot;but they are children&quot;. He just worried that 
they might disturb other passengers. If we were in Taiwan, that would not 
matter because we were all Chinese. But we are in a foreign country, we should 
behave better -- I feel this is very tiring. He [my husband] was very serious. 
The children did not care. But that affected me -- I did not feel the 
atmosphere was right -- I felt very tired on the journey.</p> 
<p><b>I: Which is the hardest period since you came here? </b></p> 
<p>F: The hardest period, that would be the first year. </p> 
<p><b>I: The first year. </b></p> 
<p>F: The first year. </p> 
<p><b>I: How did you cope with it? </b></p> 
<p>F: I cried. After I cried for a few times, I felt better. If I did not feel 
good, I cried and then I felt alright.</p> 
<p><b>I: Crying can help? Not for me. After crying, I still need a friend to 
talk with.</b></p> 
<p>F: I might scold the children -- I don't know -- because my son did not 
behave well in the first year. How to say -- he was not really behaving badly. 
Because in Taiwan they had a lot of homework, but here all the sudden -- he 
realised that he can have a different kind of life. He was still young. He did 
not know what was right and what was not wrong. In Taiwan we felt that too much 
homework and pressure was not good. But here I worried that he might fail the 
exams. I was very worried about him. He is getting better now. He is not bad -- 
in his school, in the secondary school, some students are behaving very badly, 
they are really bad. Bullying is very common, real bullying.</p> 
<p><b>I: Here? </b></p> 
<p>F: Here, there are a lot of bad students in their secondary school. They 
are really bad. They fight. He is not bad, he did not join in, but he did 
watch. Not bad, he did not join them. He is not bad.</p> 
<p><b>I: Have you talked about that with your friends or someone else, like 
people who are also parents.</b></p> 
<p>F: Friends? If I have a worry? </p> 
<p><b>I: Yes, would you? </b></p> 
<p>F: I have a friend who is also from Taiwan. But they are going home this 
year. They also have a family. Because her husband is a job. He quit his 
previous job. But my husband did not. Our situations are quite similar because 
her husband is also not young. Her husband is from Hong Kong.</p> 
<p><b>I: Is that so? Can he speak Cantonese? </b></p> 
<p>F: Yes, he can. He is a profession here. They are going home this year. But 
my friend is a Taiwanese. Her husband lived in Taiwan. They thought of getting 
a job in Hong Kong because the wages in Hong Kong are high.</p> 
<p><b>I: Yes, yes. </b></p> 
<p>F: But there are not many opportunities there. There are more opportunities 
in Taiwan, more opportunities in Taiwan.</p> 
<p><b>I: Accounting, accounting in Hong Kong... </b></p> 
<p>F: Not accounting. Her husband does subject. They are going home soon. 
Sometimes they will chat with us. I also have -- {person} -- {person} is also 
quite good.</p> 
<p><b>I: Did you meet her when you first came here? </b></p> 
<p>F: Yes, when we first arrived. Because we stayed at {location} and my 
husband brought my daughter out -- shopping before Christmas -- and met 
{person}. She is nice. She said that if we had no friends, we could go to their 
house for Christmas. Since then, we went to their house every Christmas -- 
24th, 25th, 27th, we went there (laugh).</p> 
<p><b>I: That is pretty good. </b></p> 
<p>F: {person} is very nice. We know her whole family. </p> 
<p><b>I: Who can you go for if you still have any problems, since your friend 
is leaving.</b></p> 
<p>F: I still have someone who I got to know through {person}-- {person} 
(??)-- An English woman. She is quite nice.</p> 
<p><b>I: When you were in Taiwan, if you had any problems, who did you talk to?
</b></p> 
<p>F: Neighbours. They could not solve my problems, but after chatting with 
them, I felt better. The problems were still there, but you had someone to talk 
to. Talking about it is pretty important</p> 
<p><b>I: Since we are Chinese, do you feel that you have greater pressure in 
this country?</b></p> 
<p>F: It depends on your aims. If you come here to study only, you leave once 
you get your degree. If you move to here, it would not be easy to deal with the 
society here. You are -- a second class citizen. Things are like that. I don't 
know which kind of circumstances you are talking about? Like us, after we 
finish the study, we will leave. So all the pressure is only temporary, it will 
not be -- if I thought about staying here forever, then I'd have a lot to 
consider. I think they are different.</p> 
<p><b>I: Yes, not the same. Because our orientations are not the same, 
attitudes are not the same.</b></p> 
<p>F: Not the same. Attitudes are not the same. But I think the children who 
grow up here, they will be completely different from us. Even in Taiwan, the 
old generations and young generations are very different, they are really 
different.</p> 
<p><b>I: But do you prefer staying here? </b></p> 
<p>F: If it is possible, I am willing to do so. Firstly, the environment is 
better.</p> 
<p><b>I: You mean physical? </b></p> 
<p>F: Yes, it is so disordered in Taiwan, very crowded. A high population and 
a high number of cars, people are everywhere. During holidays, Oh dear, all the 
parks are packed with people. You go there and all you can see is people. You 
will feel -- I don't know how about in Hong Kong.</p> 
<p><b>I: The same. </b></p> 
<p>F: People are everywhere. Also in Taiwan, we need to be quick all the time. 
People here are slow, and you feel that there is no need to hurry. But in 
Taiwan, always be quick, be quick, otherwise you can't compete with other 
people, you can't catch up, you have to be faster than other people. But it is 
not the same here. The education system is not same as ours. Like last time, my 
son's school has an award...</p> 
<p><b>I: Ceremony? </b></p> 
<p>F: Yes, ceremony. I attended that. They divided students by their results 
-- say top group, second group. Of course, they have different expectation on 
the students from the top group and the second group -- the teachers are not 
the same and neither is the homework. I found that they gave out the award to 
both groups of students. I was surprised to see one of the students -- because 
a girl who was my son's classmate in the primary school, she is also living in 
{location}, she came to see my son quite often. She pressed the bell and said 
she wanted to play with {son}. I found her so strange and I told her that {son} 
hadn't finished his homework yet. I asked her whether she would like to come in 
and do some work. She said yes. Then I found some homework for her to do. Two 
girls, they were two girls, their levels were not the same. It turned out that 
that girl did not know how to do multiplication. Then I did addition and 
subtraction with them. For the subtraction, she knew how to do minus nine, 
minus 10, but not minus 11. Because she used her fingers. For example, I said 
31 minus 9, she did it in this way. She did not know how to do more than 10. I 
asked her to write down the time-table, but she could not. I asked her what 
year she was in -- year 5 -- in year 5, she still did not know how to do those 
things. She only knew how to read the time from a digital display, not the 
other way to tell the time. And on the ceremony that day -- she got an award 
for maths. I was very surprised. It sounds impossible -- she should not have 
been able to make such great progress in such a short time. It may be, because 
her teacher thought that her performance in the second group was quite good -- 
she also got a certificate. In Taiwan, this is not possible. I don't know about 
the other people, but I know her well because I had taught her. At that time, I 
also asked her to do a calculation -- I've forgotten the question already -- 
she did not do it correctly. How come she also got an award? People here have a 
different concept about what standard should be achieved to give out an award 
-- you don't have to get 100 to get an award. This is quite good for the 
children. This is quite a good learning environment. The homework and project 
which my son is doing is very different from what we used to do. When we were 
students, we had to do the homework and also pass all the tests. But here 
students need to search for a lot of books and to plan how to go about their 
work. For the children, here is better.</p> 
<p><b>I: It may be better for the children, but how about for the adults, for 
example, how about job opportunities, friends...</b></p> 
<p>F: Yes, less good. But my husband is better because he has got quite a lot 
of friends. He is better at speaking -- maybe this is down to his personality 
-- I think so -- so he has got quite a lot of friends.</p> 
<p><b>I: But his friends are also your friends, aren't they? </b></p> 
<p>F: His friends are mainly those from the university. He is also quite 
friendly with the teachers.</p> 
<p><b>I: But do you gather together with them? </b></p> 
<p>F: Yes, but I did not talk a lot. You might not think that way as I talk a 
lot with you (laugh).</p> 
<p><b>I: Yes, yes, I don't think you can't talk a lot. </b></p> 
<p>F: (laugh) My husband said &quot;Look, how much you can talk -- you chatted 
on the phone for such a long time, how come you say you don't talk much&quot; 
... I don't have a lot to say, I don't have a lot to say. Unless I talk to 
those I am familiar with, otherwise I don't have much to say, especially in 
English conversations. The other day -- it is the holidays at the moment and we 
have no classes at the university -- a few &quot;Tai Tai&quot;, who are going 
home soon, contacted {person}. Do you know her? -- {person}-- she is retired.
</p> 
<p><b>I: No. </b></p> 
<p>F: She used to share the same office with him (her?). {person} retired last 
year. They asked {person} to teach us English and we paid a little bit of 
money. My course has finished already, so I went to that class. It is good to 
have a chance to speak a bit of English. I went to the class. A bit like an 
infection, they all got pregnant. Four of them got pregnant. They are still 
quite young, but they are pregnant. They talked about pregnancy and I listened 
to them. {person} asked me to talk about something. If she did not call my 
name, I would just sit there and not say a lot. I am usually like that. I sit 
there quietly. My husband often comments on it. Although I know that it is not 
good, I find it difficult to change myself.</p> 
<p><b>I: I feel that you are very active -- you visit other people. </b></p> 
<p>F: Our friend said that I care too much about what other people think of 
me. She did not care. That is if I know how you think of me -- when I say 
something, I know you would think of me like that. I care too much about other 
people. I am looking for perfection. She does not care -- even though her 
English is not good, she still tries. I listen to her on the phone, I think she 
is a bit impolite. I think people would not understand our English. I said just 
say the main points, if they don't understand, what can we do? Then we will 
forget about all the polite words, like &quot;please&quot;. When I listen to 
her, I was worrying about her. But when I say that myself, I make the same 
mistakes.</p> 
<p><b>I: Is your husband more relaxed? </b></p> 
<p>F: My husband, not really. But he is good at having funny chats with other 
people.</p> 
<p><b>I: you mean he is a fun person. </b></p> 
<p>F: I give your example. A man came to repair -- to check... (point to the 
firework)</p> 
<p><b>I: Firework. </b></p> 
<p>F: Firework. To check the gas. He chatted with my husband. My husband asked 
his name -- {name} -- a teacher at his department had the same first name and 
surname as the man -- he asked whether they had any connection. The man said 
his cousin had the same name as him, but he was not working at the university. 
Then my husband -- my husband's surname is {name}-- told him that his surname 
in Chinese also means &quot;{name}&quot;, so they were both &quot;{name}&quot; 
-- belonging to the royal family. They both broke into a big laugh. (laugh).</p>
<p><b>I: (laugh). </b></p> 
<p>F: I don't know how to chat with people like this. </p> 
<p><b>I: Neither do I. </b></p> 
<p>F: I don't know how to do that too. He is so capable -- he knows how to do 
that. I can't. It seems that it is in the nature of him. I listen to him and 
find it very interesting.</p> 
<p><b>I: Yes. That is quite good. </b></p> 
<p>F: He is capable of doing that. So he has a lot of friends. He has a lot of 
friends.</p> 
<p><b>I: But I think you can do the same because you are also willing to chat 
with people.</b></p> 
<p>F: I don't know. If it is not necessary, I won't say anything in the 
classroom, I just listen.</p> 
<p><b>I: But are you going to the class and attending the sports day? </b></p> 
<p>F: Sports day -- it was because my son asked me to go there. I had to go. I 
did not go in the first year, and my son said &quot;Mum, you did not 
come&quot;. Now he has quite a lot of friends. I did not go on some school 
trips with him. He asked me to go, but I did not. I don't know what I should 
do. If I go with him, I would remind him what to do and what not to do. I feel 
I will lose face. As a mother, I think I should tell him what is right and what 
is not right. But the foreign mothers don't care about this. I think if I went 
with him, I would be in charge of him. I don't think that is good. He would 
have more freedom if I don't go. I think I would not be able to control myself 
not to interfere.</p> 
<p><b>I: Is your expectation a bit high? </b></p> 
<p>F: Maybe. Our attitude towards children -- the cultures are completely 
different -- their mums don't care. They said give them freedom and they would 
learn it themselves later. I don't know. But our Chinese mums will tell our 
children what is right and then ask them to follow it and not to make mistakes. 
We tell them what is right. I don't know. We tell them to do this, not to do 
that -- the foreigners don't. A friend of mine, who is a teacher, told us that 
his (her) child jumped down from a high place. I said it was dangerous. At that 
time, my daughter was very small -- I was a bit worried. He (she) went to a pub 
with us. He (she) did not worry about his (her) child and said that his (her) 
child knew how to get down from the high place. But I worried. Place children 
in a high position and let them come down themselves -- I find it very ... 
looking for a word.)</p> 
<p><b>I: Dangerous? </b></p> 
<p>F: Yes, it is dangerous. But they have a different concept. He (she) is a 
teacher, he (she) has the experience and he (she) did not worry. But I worry a 
lot about my children. So I think I would better not go with my son.</p> 
<p><b>I: You said earlier that the life here is more relaxing. Does that imply 
that people here are healthier?</b></p> 
<p>F: No, I don't think so. I think that is because of the fresher air, a lot 
of space, a slower pace of life, so people here live longer. Also, because the 
welfare for the elderly people is good. I find that the social benefits here 
are good. Each month the elderly people can get &pound;70, is it &pound;70 or 
more...</p> 
<p><b>I: I don't know. </b></p> 
<p>F: The old lady next door gets &pound;70. Mainly because the rhythm of life 
here is slower. Every Wednesday, they go to 'place', a kind of centre for the 
elderly people -- they come and bring them out. Every Wednesday.</p> 
<p><b>I: They come every wed? That is quite good. </b></p> 
<p>F: Every Wednesday. They bring them -- take them to the car. If you can't 
wash your hair or take a bath, they will help you. They help them to do what 
they can't do at home. Also, they give them tea and lunch. That is good. It is 
impossible in Taiwan. They paid &pound;3 or &pound;4, it is not expensive. Of 
course, you can't get the biscuits or bread twice. Coffee should be alright 
.... potatoes -- they have a Christmas party -- quite good -- the council pays 
for that. That is very good. Sometimes they go to see art exhibitions, to pubs. 
I find that is quite good. They have meals delivered to them.</p> 
<p><b>I: yes. </b></p> 
<p>F: Our next door's next door neighbour is 88. Our next door neighbour is 
also 88. He was 87 and this year he was 88. He is male. Our next door neighbour 
is a lady and she cooks for herself. But that man -- his wife has died already 
and he has no children -- so sometimes he has that kind of meal. It is very 
convenient as they are delivered to his home. He simply puts them into the 
oven. I feel the welfare benefits for the elderly people are better here. Also 
they are a bit different from us Chinese. We Chinese have the concept that 
bringing up children to help with their old age. They are not like this. The 
next door old lady, she is clever. Although she wants to have her son around, 
she thinks that her son has his own family problems and she does not want to 
disturb him. She is very good. She is clever. She said they had their own life, 
she did not want to go and disturb them. So her son helps her do the shopping 
every Thursday and buys her a newspaper and a lottery ticket every Saturday. 
That it is. Although she wants her son to come to see her, but she does not 
force him do so. To be like this is not ...</p> 
<p><b>I: Not easy. </b></p> 
<p>F: Yes, not easy. This is different from us Chinese. Some people may ask 
for help, but she is not like that. She will try to do things herself. She does 
not want people to think she is troublesome. She does not want people to feel 
disgusted with her. Her thinking is different from us.</p> 
<p><b>I: Then do you think that we Chinese people here are healthier? </b></p> 
<p>F: Healthier? I think first you have a job, you have money -- that is very 
important -- you have money -- then if you want to do something, like go to see 
a doctor, you will have no problem, isn't that so? If you want to live in a 
nice place, then it is no problem. Like here there are some areas -- with a lot 
of single parents, they use bad language. You have a stable income, that is 
very important, and you can live very healthily, I think (laugh).</p> 
<p><b>I: (laugh). </b></p> 
<p>F: Isn't that so? You have money, you can afford to see a doctor or to be 
ill. A study has shown that rich people live longer (laugh). This is true. Rich 
people don't have to worry too much before they go to see a doctor. They don't 
have to take some difficult or dangerous jobs.</p> 
<p><b>I: how about the health service of this country? Is it quite good? </b>
</p> 
<p>F: Yes, but there is nothing more than that. If you need further treatment, 
you have to join the long waiting list. The dental treatment is expensive. The 
dental treatment is expensive. Some people don't have money to pay for that. 
This also happens.</p> 
<p><b>I: What do you think about mental health? ... What do think about it? 
</b></p> 
<p>F: Religions can be part of it. I feel religions can be very influential. I 
don't know whether those Chinese &quot;Tai Tai&quot; and Chinese ladies, who 
you have interviewed, have any religion. I think religions can be a factor. 
When we were in Taiwan, my husband was always very busy and I felt very bored 
at home all day. I sometime asked him to bring me out after his work. I told 
him that I was bored, tired, and was not comfortable staying at home. Later, I 
became a Buddhist. I bought some tapes and I felt better.</p> 
<p><b>I: (laugh). </b></p> 
<p>F: Sometimes, I listened to the tapes, to the Buddhist sermons. I felt 
better. Here some people go to church, I don't think it is useful. But many 
people don't go to church, many people don't go to church. Some people have 
gatherings at their homes or their friend's homes. Some people are doing that. 
Like this morning, I went to my daughter's sports day, her friend -- her 
classmate's mum -- her classmate's brother is the classmate of my son -- so we 
are quite familiar with each other. She does not like her mum's attitude 
towards religion -- she has her own interpretation about the Bible. Anyway, she 
is a good person. She probably doesn't go to church.</p> 
<p><b>I: But do you go to church? </b></p> 
<p>F: No, I don't. </p> 
<p><b>I: You don't go there. </b></p> 
<p>F: I don't, I am a Buddhist. </p> 
<p><b>I: Are you still listening to those tapes here? </b></p> 
<p>F: No. I've brought those tapes with me, but I haven't listened to them yet 
(laugh).</p> 
<p><b>I: (laugh) Why didn't you listen to them? </b></p> 
<p>F: Firstly, I cannot find it possible to calm myself down, there are so 
many things to do and I cannot stop. I've brought some books with me, but I 
have not read them either.</p> 
<p><b>I: But I think there is quite a lot of spare time here, isn't there? </b>
</p> 
<p>F: It depends -- take the children to school and bring them home, and then 
go shopping. There should be plenty of time, but it is busy -- time is flying. 
After you take the children to the school, you don't have time to do much and 
then it is time to bring them home. I used to attend the class as well. I went 
to watch films with my friends a few times, and my husband went to pick up the 
children. Otherwise, I would not have been able to do that, if I had had to 
rush back to pick the children up. Now I also do the ironing, We didn't iron 
our clothes in Taiwan.</p> 
<p><b>I: (laugh). </b></p> 
<p>F: But here we have to do the ironing. I do it on my own, I do the ironing 
for four people, it is very tiring.</p> 
<p><b>I: Very tiring. </b></p> 
<p>F: Our children -- my son in the secondary school -- they have a lot of 
clothes. I don't know. He told me that his friend's mum did not wash his 
clothes for him -- every times he had a PE class, he used the spray to get rid 
of the odour. I said it would not be clean by just using the spray, the stain 
would still be there. The boy is dirty.</p> 
<p><b>I: So you spend a lot of time doing... </b></p> 
<p>F: Housework? Yes. I spend a lot of time doing housework. I want my 
children going out with clean clothes, I don't want them to be dirty. If there 
is any dirt on their clothes, I will wash them as soon as possible. One of my 
daughter's friends came to our house, they are dirty -- their mums don't do the 
washing --. it is not good. It is not important whether the clothes are good 
quality or not, but they should be clean.</p> 
<p><b>I: That is pretty good ... Does any of your family members go to see a 
Chinese doctor? Apart from yourself -- you went to see a Chinese doctor once, 
how about your family members?</b></p> 
<p>F: My family members are in Taiwan. </p> 
<p><b>I: Your children? </b></p> 
<p>F: Only I have seen a Chinese doctor here. But in Taiwan, they all go to 
see Chinese doctor.</p> 
<p><b>I: How about your husband? </b></p> 
<p>F: My husband. In Taiwan, yes, he did. </p> 
<p><b>I: But not here? </b></p> 
<p>F: He doesn't like going to see a doctor here. </p> 
<p><b>I: Why? Is he very healthy? </b></p> 
<p>F: I don't know. He is not very healthy -- he likes taking medicine. </p> 
<p><b>I: You mean he takes his own medicine. He takes his own medicine without 
seeing a doctor...</b></p> 
<p>(Side B) </p> 
<p><b>I: They gave you antibiotics, didn't they? </b></p> 
<p>F: I would take them, but he -- he said antibiotics are not effective. I 
said how come you expect a result by taking them just twice -- they are not 
poison. You have to take the antibiotics for several days before you see the 
result.</p> 
<p><b>I: Yes, yes. </b></p> 
<p>F: I said that to him. It is hopeless. He does not see a doctor. </p> 
<p><b>I: Does your family prefer Chinese medicine, your family? </b></p> 
<p>F: No (laugh). </p> 
<p><b>I: No (laugh). </b></p> 
<p>F: The children don't have to pay for the treatment if you go to see a 
western doctor, but not a Chinese doctor. But for the chronic illnesses, I 
think Chinese medicine is better. For the children, western medicine is more 
effective. For example asthma -- like my son, he suffers from asthma when the 
weather is not good ...</p> 
<p><b>I: I have that too. </b></p> 
<p>F: You have that too. Ice-cold food is not good for asthma. But children 
can't resist ice-cold food. They need exercise in that kind of weather. 
Recently he hasn't taken the medicine. Do you use an inhaler?</p> 
<p><b>I: I did. </b></p> 
<p>F: How about now? </p> 
<p><b>I: Not now. I am not using it now, I have sore throat and it is very 
uncomfortable. I am not coughing now. I am not using it now.</b></p> 
<p>F: How long have you used it for? </p> 
<p><b>I: No. If I used it every day, I found my throat was very sore and I 
didn't like it.</b></p> 
<p>F: Which one did you use -- blue or brown? </p> 
<p><b>I: I used both. </b></p> 
<p>F: When did you stop? ... Summer, when the weather is better. </p> 
<p><b>I: Since March. </b></p> 
<p>F: March -- it was still quite cold at that time. My son -- I told him 
recently -- your inhaler has steroids, isn't it? That one is not good, it can 
be addictive.</p> 
<p><b>I: I asked them and they said it did not matter. </b></p> 
<p>F: But that is not good. I talked with him, he studies medicine -- He 
talked to my son, but my son did not believe it -- he found using it very 
convenient -- he was surprised to hear that it could be additive -- he felt in 
great pain without it. When the weather got cold, he thought he needed it. 
Later, I told him that it was not good, not good, not good. Gradually, he gets 
better -- he forces himself not to use it. Sometime, I saw he was going to be 
short of breath, but he would overcome it and get better later. He did not use 
an inhaler in Taiwan. He started to use it here and it was not easy to stop. 
How many years did you use it for?</p> 
<p><b>I: I started to use it last September... I did not have asthma before. I 
asked them why I got it, they said it is probably because of stress.</b></p> 
<p>F: Stress? </p> 
<p><b>I: They said many people did not realise it... But I didn't like it -- 
it made me uncomfortable.</b></p> 
<p>F: You felt uncomfortable if you used it, but he felt uncomfortable if he 
did not use it.</p> 
<p><b>I: Maybe we are not the same. It may be because I worried about the 
steroids, so I didn't like it.</b></p> <br>
