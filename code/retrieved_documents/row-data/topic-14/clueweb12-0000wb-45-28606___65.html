<h2>Preface</h2> 
<p>As every school child knows, China is the most populous nation on our 
planet. Historically, Chinese immigration to the United States was limited, 
compared to immigration from Europe, due to strict immigration quotas. In 
recent decades, however, that has been reversed. Currently, China, including 
Hong Kong and Taiwan, is one of the principal countries of origin of immigrants 
to theU.S.</p> 
<p>In spite of the large numbers of Chinese in the U.S., most Americans have a 
very limited knowledge of Chinese language and culture. Culture has a very 
strong impact upon our understanding of disability and of the goals and 
processes of rehabilitation. Therefore, persons born in China may, like other 
recent immigrants, have difficulty using rehabilitation services in this 
country. The goal of this monograph is to provide an introduction to Chinese 
culture, focusing on information that may help rehabilitation service providers 
to better serve this population.</p> 
<p>The author is very well qualified to write on this subject. A first 
generation immigrant from the People's Republic of China, Gloria Liu holds a 
master's degree in special education with a major in rehabilitation science 
from Clarion University of Pennsylvania. Since 1993 she has been working with 
people with disabilities in the capacity of counselor and bilingual case 
manager. She started working with people with traumatic brain injury (TBI) in 
1995 and has served as coordinator of different traumatic brain injury projects 
for the Association for the Help of Retarded Children&ndash;New York City 
Chapter and currently as a regional resource development specialist for the New 
York State Department of HealthTBI Waiver Program. Part of her responsibilities 
in these roles has been to develop and translate culturally competent education 
and outreach materials onTBI for use by rehabilitation professionals, consumers 
and family. She has also worked to establish support networks for consumers and 
their families from ethnically and culturally diverse communities. These 
activities have given Ms. Liu a keen insight into the difficulties in bridging 
the cultural gap between the rehabilitation service provider and persons from 
China, as well as strategies for overcoming these difficulties. Most of the 
case examples presented in this monograph are derived from the author's own 
experience.</p> 
<p>The author joins me in acknowledging and thanking Fong Chan, Ph.D. 
Professor and Area Chair, Rehabilitation Psychology Program, University of 
Wisconsin-Madison, Deborah Chen,Ph.D., Professor, Department of Special 
Education California State University, Northridge and Jen&ndash;Liang Hwang, a 
doctoral student in rehabilitation science at the University at Buffalo, State 
University of New York, all of whom reviewed the manuscript and provided 
valuable suggestions for strengthening it.</p> 
<p>This monograph is part of a series developed by CIRRIE at the University at 
Buffalo. The mission ofCIRRIE is to assist rehabilitation researchers and 
practitioners in theU.S. to access international expertise. CIRRIE is supported 
by a grant from the National Institute on Disability and Rehabilitation 
Research of theU.S. Department of Education. In addition to the monograph 
series,CIRRIE conducts workshops on providing rehabilitation services to 
foreign-born persons. We hope that this monograph will be useful to you in your 
work with persons born in China. We welcome your comments that will enable us 
to deepen our understanding of ways to increase the effectiveness of 
rehabilitation services for persons born in other countries.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2> 
<p>The 2000 census shows the Chinese to be the largest single group of Asians 
in America and that Asians and Pacific Islanders represent four percent of the
U.S. population (U.S. Bureau of Census, 2000). The Asian American Health Forum 
(1990) revealed that more than 63 percent of Chinese Americans are 
foreign&ndash;born, 23 percent do not speak English well, 72.5 percent speak a 
language other than English at home and 53 percent live in the Western United 
States.</p> 
<p>The Chinese in America are a heterogeneous group. They include people from 
mainland China, Taiwan, Hong Kong and other Southeast Asian countries, and are 
characterized by significant linguistic, social, economic and political 
differences (Chan, 1998).</p> 
<p>This author uses the word &quot;China&quot; to refer to mainland China, 
Hong Kong and Taiwan. The purpose of this monograph is to present the unique 
cultural backgrounds, sub&ndash;cultures, religions, socio&ndash;cultural 
milieu and rehabilitation systems in mainland China, Taiwan and Hong Kong and 
compare the practice and delivery of rehabilitation services in China and the 
United States.</p> 
<p>There are differences in acculturation among Chinese immigrants from 
different parts of the world, between foreign&ndash;born versus American-born 
Chinese Americans and between different generations of Chinese Americans, but 
the focus here will be on the common elements in their cultural backgrounds. 
This author believes that cross&ndash;cultural analysis of this kind will help 
American rehabilitation providers appreciate and understand the Chinese culture 
and rehabilitation system. Only with genuine understanding of the Chinese 
culture and subcultural differences can American rehabilitation professionals 
effectively serve individuals with special needs within the 
Chinese&ndash;American community.</p> 
<h2>China: An Overview</h2> 
<p>China has one of the four oldest civilizations in the world and a written 
history of 4,000 years. China's long history includes eras of primitive 
society, slave society, feudalism and semi&ndash;feudalism, 
semi&ndash;colonialism and the present socialist society (&quot;China Today, 
2000&quot;). The Chinese are very proud of their society. They value their own 
culture and religion but are open and pragmatic towards the religions and 
cultures of others.</p> 
<p>Chinese people in general are peaceful, hardworking and easily contented. 
They respect authority and elders and are patient with their fellows. They 
will, however, push and sacrifice for their children. The Chinese value 
modesty, reserved behavior and humility. They believe in harmony and tend to 
avoid confrontation.</p> 
<p>China in the Twenty First century is stronger than ever. Since 1979, when 
its &quot;Open Door Policy&quot; was established, it has been engaged in an 
effort to reform its economy. Deng Xiao Ping and his supporters placed top 
priority on the opening of its economic market. When Jiang Zemin was 
re&ndash;elected president and Zhu Rongji selected as premier in 1998 after 
Deng's death, the &quot;third generation leaders&quot; firmly committed to 
economic reform and opened China to the outside world. The new Chinese 
leadership has identified reform of state industries as a government priority. 
Government strategies for achieving that goal include large&ndash;scale 
privatization of unprofitable state&ndash;owned enterprises as well as 
downsizing the government bureaucracy (Bureau of East Asian and Pacific Affairs
U.S. Department of State, 2001). The reunification of China, and Hong Kong and 
Macao at the end of the Twentiethth Century also strengthened China.</p>

<h2>Immigration History</h2> 
<p>Chinese migration to the U.S. has a history of more than 150 years. It is a 
complex, fascinating story of change, adaptation, and survival that reveals how 
the Chinese family system is affected by the immense power of political, legal, 
socialand economic forces (Lee, 1996).</p> 
<h3>The First Wave: The Pioneer Family (1840&ndash;1919)</h3> 
<p>Although, there were Chinese in the United States prior to 1800, they began 
to arrive in large numbers in the 1840s in response to the demand for cheap 
labor provoked by the discovery of gold in California and the construction of 
railroads (Sue &amp; Sue, 1999).</p> 
<p>The Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, which was not repealed until 1943 when 
China became an American ally at the beginning of World WarII, barred Chinese 
laborers and their relatives (including wives) from entering the United States. 
The act was broadened to include<em>all</em> Chinese people.</p> 
<p>Early Chinese immigrants lived in a virtually womanless world without 
family life (Lee, 1996).</p> 
<p>While the Chinese immigrant population declined, those remaining survived 
in the face of anti&ndash;miscegenation laws, special taxes directed against 
them, institutional racism, persistent humiliation, racial violence, loss of 
property, loss of livelihood and sometimes loss of life (Chan, 1998). All this 
had a profound impact on the development of family life among the early Chinese 
in theU.S. (Lee, 1996).</p> 
<h3>The Second Wave: The Small Business Family (1920&ndash;1940)</h3> 
<p>The discriminatory Immigration Act of 1924 allowed American citizens of 
Chinese ancestry to work in the United States but without their wives and 
families. The law changed in 1930 to allowed wives of Chinese merchants and 
Chinese women married to American citizens before 1924 to immigrate to the 
United States. As a result, sizable family units with second&ndash;generation, 
American&ndash;born Chinese people began to come together in 
&quot;Chinatowns.&quot; Meanwhile, many first&ndash;wave laborers left the 
mines and railroads and used their savings to start small businesses (Lee, 
1996).</p> 
<h3>The Third Wave: The Reunited Family (1943&ndash;1964)</h3> 
<p>In 1943 after years, even decades of separation changes in the immigration 
law meant that many wives were reunited with their husbands for the first time. 
Due to the reform in immigration policies, many Chinese men returned to their 
native land to find wives, who were usually 10&ndash;20 years younger than 
them. Consequently from 1943 to the repeal of the quota law in 1965, most 
Chinese immigrants were female (Lee, 1996).</p> 
<h3>The Fourth Wave: The Chinatown, Dual Worker Family and the Students 
(1965&ndash;1977)</h3> 
<p>The 1965 Immigration Act replaced a 21 year&ndash;old exclusionary system 
of immigration. If the earlier policy aimed to freeze the country's ethnic 
balance, the 1965 act assigned a flat annual quota of 20 thousand immigrant 
visas to every country outside the Western Hemisphere. Following the passage of 
this act, Chinese immigration reached its peak (Pan, 1990). Most of the Chinese 
immigrants who arrived under the Immigration Act of 1965 came as families. Many 
initially settled in or near Chinatowns in the major metropolitan areas. 
Approximately half were of the working&ndash; class. Most husbands and wives 
sought employment in labor&ndash;intense, low&ndash;capital services, such as 
garment sweatshops and restaurants. Economic survival was the primary goal for 
many Chinese families, especially the new immigrants. (Lee, 1996).</p> 
<p>Before 1978, when the U.S. established diplomatic relations with mainland 
China and crossed its recognition of Taiwan in favor of that of the People's 
Republic, Taiwanese comprised most of the 20 thousand per year quota. Taiwanese 
students have been settling in theU.S. using the quota since the 1960's. Unlike 
the earlier immigrants of humble rural origin, many of the Taiwan arrivals came 
from well&ndash;to&ndash;do and/or well&ndash;educated families and many were 
students who, upon graduation from American universities, stayed on to work in 
the United States (Pan, 1990).</p> 
<h3>The Fifth Wave: The Students/Scholars and Refugees (1978&ndash;Present)
</h3> 
<p>Taiwan retained its right to a 20 thousand per&ndash;year U.S. immigration 
quota when the U.S. normalized its relations with mainland China in 1978, and 
the People's Republic was given its own quota of 20 thousand. There was an 
additional quota of 600 (increased to five thousand on October 1, 1987) 
immigrants from Hong Kong. That meant that a total of 40,600 Chinese could come 
to theU.S. each year (Pan, 1990).</p> 
<p>The reestablishment of diplomatic relations between the United States and 
the People's Republic of China in 1978 provided an opportunity for students and 
professionals from China to study and lecture in the United States, and many of 
them elected to stay (Lee, 1996). TheU.S. government granted special permanent 
residency status to a large number of Chinese students and visiting scholars in 
theU.S. immediately following the 1989 Tiananmen protest demonstrations (Pan, 
1990). Most of these students and scholars came from prestigious universities 
in China.</p> 
<p>Another group of immigrants to the U.S. were refugees of Chinese decent 
from Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia. A significant number of them were survivors 
of hunger, rape, incarceration, forced migration and torture. There are also 
&quot;overseas Chinese&quot; who emigrate from countries like Japan, Korea, 
Philippines, Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Mexico, Canada and many other 
countries in South America and Europe. (Lee, 1996).</p> 
<p>In summary, as Lee (1996, p. 252) points out, &quot;the influx of 
immigrants and refugees from many different parts of Asia and from many 
different socioeconomic and political backgrounds has contributed to the 
complexity of existing Chinese American communities.&quot;</p> 
<h2>Concept of Disability</h2> 
<p>The traditional Chinese term for disability is &quot;canfei,&quot; meaning 
&quot;handicap&quot; and &quot;useless,&quot; or &quot;canji,&quot; meaning 
&quot;handicap&quot; and &quot;illness.&quot; This demonstrates how the Chinese 
used to view disability. The term &quot;canji ren,&quot; meaning 
&quot;handicapped&quot; and &quot;sick people,&quot; is also common. The term 
&quot;gong neng zhang ai zhe,&quot; meaning &quot;individuals with 
disabilities&quot; is rarely used.</p> 
<p>In many areas of China disability is viewed as a punishment for the 
disabled person's parental or past&ndash;life sins. When encountering health 
problems, many religious people, especially those from rural areas where 
medical resources are not readily available or sufficient will visit temples or 
Taoist priest houses to pray, worship or perform rituals in order to find out 
the cause of and/or the solutions to their diseases or disabilities.</p> 
<p>Mental health is believed to be achieved through self&ndash;discipline, 
exercise of power and the avoidance of morbid thoughts. Emotional problems are 
understood to be associated with weak character. (Lee, 1996). In some cases, 
mental illness is blamed on evil spirits or punishment from god(s). Another 
belief is that unbalanced diet, eating food that should be avoided, or 
emotional disturbance during pregnancy will cause illness or disability of the 
newborn. For instance, grief or having temper tantrums during pregnancy is 
perceived to possibly cause the mother to lose her baby or to produce a baby 
with disabilities. Lam (1992 discussed an example of a mother who blamed her 
child's epilepsy on the lamb she ate during pregnancy. Epilepsy, &quot;Yang 
Dian Feng,&quot; translates as &quot;shaking of the lamb&quot; in Chinese. The 
mother believed that the lamb she ate passed the &quot;shaking of the 
lamb&quot; to her child. In general, disability is viewed as something shameful 
&ndash; and a skeleton in the closet. One of the author's cousins was diagnosed 
with schizophrenia in his early twenties. No one in the family wanted to talk 
about it, certainly not to people outside of the family. So it simply remained 
a well&ndash;kept family secret for many years.</p> 
<p>Lam (1992) described shame and guilt as a complicated mix in the family of 
the disabled. Shame towards the outside world is would be felt by the family 
(especially the head of the family) as well as by the disabled persons 
themselves. The stigma attached to disability may generate the family's fear of 
exposure to criticism and disgrace. Guilt might be felt by the individual with 
a disability towards his or her family or by the family towards the individual 
with disability, as well as towards ancestors. These feelings often create 
conflicts and barriers to for acceptance among family members (Lam, 1992). 
Although shame and guilt are often associated with disabilities in Chinese 
culture, as in American culture, Chung (1996) pointed out that the Eastern 
system focuses on the<em>cause</em> of illness, that is, why it happened, 
whereas in the West, the focus is usually on the<em>solution</em> to treatment 
for the disease. It is essential, therefore, to educate the Chinese consumer 
and family about the nature and/or cause of the disability as well as about 
treatment methods and available services.</p> 
<p>Misunderstanding of or lack of knowledge about a specific disability or 
illness can cause a tremendous amount of fear, hostility, alienation and blame. 
This author was stunned by an article in the most popular Chinese newspaper<em>
World Journal</em>. It tells a sad story of a nine&ndash;year old Chinese boy, 
Ning Li, who acquiredAIDS from a blood transfusion, received for a broken arm 
in 1996. Immediately after his diagnosis, Ning Li was terminated from his 
school and to date no school will accept him due to the nature of his illness. 
He has since lost all his friends, as have his parents. A neighbor even moved 
after learning the boy hadAIDS. The neighbor's house is still empty because 
nobody will purchase it. Ning's father took him to see a doctor who told Ning, 
&quot;don't touch my desk&quot; when he learned the boy hadAIDS. (Wu, 2000). 
This happened in a small town in Twenty First century mainland China.</p> 
<p>Wang, Chan, Thomas, Lin &amp; Larson (1997) summarized Chan and colleagues' 
1984 and 1988 study findings that Chinese participants were more positive 
toward people with physical disabilities than toward people with developmental 
disabilities and mental disorders but that Chinese students were less positive 
in their attitudes toward people with physical or mental disabilities than 
their American counterparts. Chinese people are generally more accepting and 
sympathetic toward an<em>acquired</em> injury that causes physical limitations 
than toward a congenital physical or mental disorder. The same section of the 
previously mentioned<em>World Journal</em> for instance, there was an article 
about a 29&ndash;year&ndash;old lady, Lan Mao, who has been loved by numerous 
health care professionals and strangers despite her severe disabilities. Unlike 
Ning Li, Lan was born in Beijing, the capital city of mainland China, where she 
lives today. Lan was almost burned to death in a fire 27 years ago. She is 
reported to be the only survivor of such severe burns in Chinese medical 
history.</p> 
<p>Lan's face remains severely maimed even after numerous reconstructive 
surgeries. She lost her hands, her hair, many facial features and will never be 
able to stand. Lan's parents left and never returned after seeing her on the 
hospital bed after the fire. So she has remained in the hospital for 27 years, 
cared for by team after team of physicians, nursing personnel and volunteers. 
The hospital received many donations that paid for all the expenses of her stay 
including her medical bills. In order to facilitate Lan's independent living in 
the community, her hospital assisted her in selecting a &quot;new home.&quot; 
Recently, she transferred to an excellent independent living and vocational 
training residential facility (Dong, 2000).</p> 
<h2>Disability and Rehabilitation Systems</h2> 
<p>Due to the political, economic and social differences between mainland 
China, Hong Kong and Taiwan, provisions of rehabilitation and social services 
to people with disabilities vary considerably. For instance, mainland China, a 
communist country that went through ten years of cultural revolution and many 
other socialist movements, has adopted many aspects of the Western 
medical/rehabilitation system and it has aggressively developed its own system 
over the past two decades. Hong Kong, a British Colony for 99 years and a 
Special Administrative Region of China today, has a very advanced 
rehabilitation system. Lam (1992) noted that one of its major rehabilitation 
services, vocational rehabilitation, is quite similar to that of the United 
States. Taiwan, a strategic partner of theU.S. during the cold war era, also is 
strongly influenced by theU.S. health care and rehabilitation systems.</p> 
<h3>Mainland China</h3> 
<p>China Disabled Persons Federation (CDPF, 2000), based on its 1987 national 
survey, claims that persons with disabilities comprise 5 percent of the Chinese 
population (63 million). For various social, and economic reasons, historically 
there has not been much emphasis on disability issues. The China Fund for the 
Disabled was not established until 1984. The China Disabled Persons Federation 
was established in 1988. Prior to that, little attention or assistance was 
given to those with disabilities (Ong, 1993).</p> 
<p>Yamashiro &amp; Matsuoka (1997) found that Asian Americans significantly 
underuse formal mental health services, a fact they attribute to a mismatch of 
cultural perspectives and language barriers. In the view of this author one of 
the major reasons that mainland Chinese immigrants underuse existing mental 
health services is that in China people with mental illness are commonly cared 
for by their families and/or depend on community support rather than 
institutional care.</p> 
<p>Chen (1995) found that in mainland China, state&ndash;run inpatient 
services for the mentally ill have about 140,000 psychiatric beds available in 
800 psychiatric institutions, or 1.17 beds for every 10,000 Chinese. This means 
more than 95 percent of the mentally ill are unable to be admitted to the 
hospital, which is why so most are taken care of by their families. Since 
China's implementation of the one child per couple policy, however, greater 
attention has been given to the mental health of the single child. The first 
Child Mental Health Research Center was established in Nanjing in 1984 (Bond, 
1986). It is suggested increasing emphasis on hospital&ndash;based and 
community&ndash;based rehabilitation for the mentally ill in recent years. 
Programs involving psychological counseling, psychotherapy and behavior 
modification have been set up in many general hospitals, universities and 
schools (Chen, 1995). Such concepts, then are not new to recently immigrated 
Chinese consumers and families.</p> 
<p>Another area of development is the field of special education. China's 
Education Law of 1986 made it obligatory to provide special education for 
individuals with mental retardation (Chen, 1995). The Chinese definition of 
mental retardation is similar to that of the American. It recognizes four 
degrees: first degree (IQ under 20 or 25), second degree (IQ between 
20&ndash;35 or 25&ndash;40), third degree (IQ between 35&ndash;50 or 
40&ndash;55) and the fourth degree (IQ 50&ndash;70 or 55&ndash;75) (Shanghai 
Books Publisher, 1994). The China Disabled Person's Federation consequently set 
up the Rehabilitation Research Association for people with mental retardation 
and a number of other societies have been formed under the auspices of the 
Chinese Medical Association. These societies provide professional consultation 
to concerned ministries and play a significant role in the evolution of 
rehabilitation policy. All this has helped create favorable conditions for the 
continued development of mental rehabilitation in China. (Chen, 1995). In 
general, however only children with<em>physical</em> disabilities can receive 
mainstream education. Children with mental disabilities, hearing/language 
impairment and visual impairment receive special education in special schools, 
such as schools for the mentally retarded, schools for the mute and deaf, and 
schools for the blind.</p> 
<p>Mainland China is at a stage at which it is pushing for the establishment 
of segregated special education schools, while Americans have embraced the 
mainstreaming and are working for inclusion. Therefore, recently immigrated 
Chinese parents of children with disabilities may be very skeptical about the 
inclusion concept. The parents may fear that their children cannot receive an 
appropriate education or get the attention they need in &quot;regular&quot; 
classroom/school settings. They may also fear that their children will be 
stigmatized and laughed at by &quot;normal&quot; American children. Due to 
language barriers, however, they may not be able to convey their concerns. 
Also, due to their accepting and non&ndash;confrontational nature, they may 
seem to be contented with an arrangement even if they are not.</p> 
<p>This author worked as a case manager for a 25 year&ndash;old young woman, 
Sun, a Chinese American who was legally blind, non&ndash;verbal and diagnosed 
with moderate mental retardation. Sun was able to understand Cantonese, which 
was the only language that her parents spoke, and a few words in English. She 
responded to questions by nodding, shaking her head or making certain sounds. 
When the author started working with her she had been attending a traditional 
day treatment program for people with mental retardation for a few years. She 
seemed to be comfortable there, but on the occasion of a home visit to see her 
and her parents in their Chinatown apartment, it became apparent that Sun's 
parents really preferred that she attend a special school for the blind. They 
said that even though they had this wish for a long time, they were not able to 
make their needs known because of language barriers.</p> 
<p>Sun's past case managers spoke only English. They would periodically check 
as to whether Sun's parents were satisfied with the day treatment program and 
the parents would always say &quot;yes,&quot; unable to express their wish for 
a more appropriate setting for their daughter. This author worked with Sun's 
parents and located an excellent program for adults and children with visual 
impairment. Sun was transferred to this program and appeared to be happier as 
she was more comfortable with the environment and was able to engage in 
activities designed for the blind. Sun has been attending the special program 
ever since.</p> 
<p>Like the development of special education, the development of 
rehabilitation also started in China in the 80's. China Rehabilitation Research 
Center (CRRC), a state owned institution, was established in 1988. CRRC, 
affiliated with the China Disabled Persons Federation, provides comprehensive 
rehabilitation and social services to people with disabilities, carries out 
scientific research, offers professional training, conducts information 
exchange and serves as a technical resource to the Chinese rehabilitation 
network. Combining educational, social and vocational rehabilitation, CRRC 
established a comprehensive medical rehabilitation system that integrates 
western medicine and traditional Chinese medicine, emergency care, early 
recovery and long term care.</p> 
<p>Subsequent to the establishment of CRRC, many rehabilitation centers were 
established in the country's large urban cities (CRRC, 2000). They are divided 
primarily into hospital&ndash; or community&ndash;based rehabilitation centers. 
Shanghai Cishu Chu Ban She (1994,p. 108) defined rehabilitation as</p> 
<blockquote> comprehensively and appropriately utilizing medical, social, 
educational, vocational and other measures to train and re&ndash;train 
individuals with disabilities in order to reduce the consequences caused by the 
factors of disabilities, to improve their functions and abilities, therefore, 
for them to integrate into the society with equal rights, value and dignity as 
human beings.</blockquote> 
<p>Even though this rehabilitation concept was adopted from western countries, 
the Chinese system includes traditional Chinese treatment methods. For 
instance, in mainland China, massage,Tai Chi, Chi Gong, magnetic treatment and 
acupuncture are part of physical therapy.</p> 
<p>Mainland China has many programs, procedures, laws and policies that are 
mandated and enforced by the government. For example, in vocational 
rehabilitation, four steps are followed:</p> 
<ol> 
<li>Vocational assessment, which assesses the consumer's vocational uniqueness 
and employment preference</li> 
<li>Vocational guidance which provides assistance in vocational selection and 
employment adjustment. It includes job placement, employment and settlement.
</li> 
<li>Vocational training which provides training to consumers according to 
their needs, background and ability. For instance, language training is 
provided to individuals with language impairment. Mobility/travel training is 
provided to individuals with visual impairment. Training programs are it is 
divided into pre&ndash;employment training, employment adjustment training and 
work placement.</li> 
<li>Job placement helps individuals with disabilities find suitable employment.
</li> </ol> 
<p>While vocational assessment, vocational guidance and vocational training 
systems in China are similar to those in the American system, job placement 
works very differently.</p> 
<p>The revised Chinese Constitution of 1982 and the Law on the Protection of 
the Disabled Persons (1992) emphasizes that families, work units and community 
organizations must share the responsibility for caring for the disabled. Under 
the work program for disabled persons, the government provides income tax 
relief to any enterprise in which 35 percent of the employees are disabled 
(Chen, 1995).</p> 
<p>Shanghai, one of the largest and most developed cities in China, has issued 
in procedures that command state organs, public organizations, enterprises and 
institutions within the administrative area of the Shanghai municipality to 
allocate 1.6 percent of the average number on their payroll lists for the 
previous year as jobs for persons with disability.</p> 
<p>The unit that does not fulfil the specified quota for the job placement of 
the handicapped must submit 1.6 percent of its gross salary account for the 
previous year to an employment guarantee fund for the handicapped.</p> 
<p>It is important for American vocational counselors to keep different work 
incentives in mind when working with immigrants from mainland China. They are 
likely to experience from their Chinese consumers different expectations of and 
different requirements for job placement.</p> 
<p>In addition to the development of laws, organizations and rehabilitation 
services for persons with disabilities, China has made a great effort to 
promote sports among people with disabilities. Almost two decades after the 
founding of the International Special Olympics Committee in 1968, the Chinese 
founded a sports association for the mentally retarded. Since then more then 
500,000 individuals with mental retardation have participated in mainland 
China's Special Olympics (Wong, 2000)</p> 
<h4>Population of People with Disabilities (Mainland)</h4> 
<p>The first census of individuals with disabilities in mainland China was 
taken in 1987. There were 19 categories in the census, which sampled 369,448 
households, a total of 1,579,316 individuals. The sampling indicated that 5 
percent of the population or 63 million people had visual, hearing, physical, 
mental impairments and/or mental illness (see Table 1).</p> 
<p>Wong (2000) reported that there are 11.82 million people with mental 
retardation alone in mainland China today.</p> <strong>Table 1: 1987 Census

<h3>Hong Kong</h3> 
<p>Lam (1992) commended Hong Kong's long history of rehabilitation services, 
whose most significant developments have occurred since World WarII. 
Chronologically, the 1940s were marked by the development of physiotherapy, 
occupational therapy and prosthetics. The 1950s saw the development of 
sheltered workshops, training centers, residential homes and recreational and 
social clubs for people with physical disabilities, blindness and mental 
retardation. In the 1960s, special education developed as a separate service 
within the education system. The first two medical rehabilitation centers in 
Hong Kong opened in 1962 and 1963. (Lam, 1992).</p> 
<p>The former Hong Kong government and voluntary agencies worked closely on an 
integrated and coordinated approach to rehabilitation. They completed of a 
ten&ndash;year rehabilitation program plan in 1976 and in 1977 published a 
white paper titled &quot;Integrating the Disabled into the Community: A United 
Effort.&quot; Subsequently a Rehabilitation Development Coordinating Committee (
RDCC) was appointed by the governor to advise the overall development of 
rehabilitation services and policies. Under theRDCC, three subcommittees focus 
on employment, education and personnel; accessibility and transportation, and 
public education (Lam, 1992).</p> 
<p>The rehabilitation program plan developed by the RDCC presents a 
comprehensive picture of current rehabilitation services in Hong Kong and 
projects development needs a decade in advance. The program plan is reviewed 
annually by a joint committee of government departments and 
non&ndash;government organizations. Through this planning process, priorities 
and needs are identified and of resources are allocated (Lam, 1992).</p> 
<p>With the exception of medical rehabilitation, about 70 percent of direct 
services for people with disabilities in Hong Kong are provided by voluntary 
organizations. The Joint Council for the Physically and Mentally Disabled, a 
division of the Hong Kong Council for Social Services, coordinates voluntary 
rehabilitation organizations and represents their interests in policy making 
with the Hong Kong government (Lam, 1992).</p> 
<p>Vocational rehabilitation, which includes vocational guidance and 
assessment, vocational training and placement, is one of the major 
rehabilitation services available to Hong Kong residents with disabilities 
(Lam, 1992). Ting &amp; Fitzgerald (1996) found some increases in awareness and 
knowledge of occupational health and rehabilitation matters by legislative 
councilors, District Board members, labor union members, and employees. They 
also pointed out that attitude changes towards occupational rehabilitation 
services had created opportunities to expand services in this area.</p> 
<p>By and large, Hong Kong, which was under British rule for about 100 years, 
has medical and rehabilitation systems more similar to those in theU.S. than to 
those in mainland China. Since English is the official language in Hong Kong, 
it may be easier for Hong Kong immigrants to understand and maneuver through 
the American rehabilitation system than for newcomers from mainland China 
and/or Taiwan.</p> 
<h4>Population of People with Disabilities (Hong Kong)</h4> 
<p>A computerized central registry for rehabilitation was set up by the Hong 
Kong government in 1983 to systematically collect data on persons with 
disabilities in need of rehabilitation services. Through September 1989, there 
were 111,298 persons with disabilities registered with the central registry, or 
1.9 percent of the total population of 5.8 million. Prevalence rates derived 
from the United States and other western countries, coupled with the reluctance 
of the Chinese to report such cases, suggests that the total population of 
people with disabilities is closer to 437,569 or 7.5 percent of the total 
population of Hong Kong (Lam, 1992).</p> 
<h3>Taiwan</h3> 
<p>Copper (1999) maintains that social welfare has had a deep impact on 
Taiwan's society and culture. Social welfare programs used to aim at groups 
considered vital to maintaining political stability. Therefore, the military, 
labor, and government employees were the biggest beneficiaries. They now 
address anyone who needs assistance. Copper points out that in the early 1980s 
the government passed three pieces of legislation to aid the disadvantaged 
population: the Aged Welfare Law the Handicapped Welfare Law, and the Social 
Assistance Law. Child care, child protection services, campaigns against drug 
abuse, services for the disabled and low&ndash;cost housing are just some of 
the services made available by these laws (Copper, 1999).</p> 
<p>National Health Insurance (NHI) was inaugurated by the Taiwan government in 
1995 to provide health care for the entire nation, lighten the public's 
financial burden, provide adequate health care and uphold the rights of the 
public to equal&ndash;access medical care (National Health Insurance Profile, 
1999). TheNHI program includes outpatient and inpatient services, Chinese 
medicine, dental care, childbirth, physical therapy, preventive health care, 
home care, rehabilitation for chronic mental illness,etc.</p> 
<p>The scope of care includes diagnosis, examinations, tests, consulting, 
surgery, drugs, supplies/devices, treatment, nursing care,etc. It is noteworthy 
thatNHI offers services to the disadvantaged and patients who need medical care 
most. More than 350,000 people hold major illness/injury certificates that 
exempt them from co&ndash;payments. In addition, the Bureau of National Health 
Insurance (BNHI) offers attractive commissions to medical teams willing to 
serve in remote regions with scarce health resources (National Health Insurance 
Profile, 1999). Individuals with disabilities also can apply for a 
&quot;handicappedID&quot; that entitles them to available social welfare and 
health services.</p> 
<p>In order to discourage discriminatory practices imposed on people with 
disabilities, a law passed in 1990 calls for state&ndash;run enterprises to 
hire at least one individual with a disability for every fifty employees and 
for private companies to hire one for every one hundred employees. 
Organizations that fail to comply face a fine equal to the minimum monthly wage 
of 487 American dollars. The penalties collected by the respective local 
government are used to implement welfare programs such as vocational training 
and employment assistance and to reward companies that employ more people with 
disabilities than required by the legal quota. Since the law on mandatory 
employment began to be enforced, some 20,000 job opportunities annually have 
been extended to people with disabilities (Her, 1999).</p> 
<p>Amendments to Taiwan's laws include the abolition of restrictions imposed 
upon people with disabilities who take the Joint University Entrance Exam. It 
was not until 1988 that the government finally abolished these restrictions and 
opened the door for people with disabilities to pursue advanced education. 
There also is a new requirement for the construction of accessible facilities 
for people with disabilities (Her, 1999).</p> 
<p>Her (1999) estimates that the number of Taiwan's children with mental 
retardation is 158,000. Jacob Chen, chief executive officer of the Eden Social 
Welfare Foundation, points out that if children with mental retardation can 
receive early treatment before the age of three, the benefits to them will be 
ten times greater than with later treatment. Her said the period from birth to 
age six is critical and determines the extent of physical disability in of 
these children (Her, 1999). Her also reported that Chen expressed his sadness 
at the current conditions for Taiwan's children with mental retardation, since 
fewer than three percent are lucky enough to receive early treatment.</p> 
<p>Eden, founded in 1982, was the first organization to provide the disabled 
in Taiwan with vocational training. Eden obtains funds from private fundraising 
activities, government subsidies or government commissioned projects and Eden's 
own business operations. Eden offers vocational training to people with 
disabilities in the moderate to severe range. Those who participate in these 
vocational training program not only receive intensive professional training 
free of charge, but can also apply for a monthly living subsidy of aboutU.S. 
$400.</p> 
<p>Her (1999, p. 36) noted that &quot;the traditional view in Taiwan is that 
disabled people are the way they are because they did something bad in their 
previous lives, and that they therefore deserve their afflictions.&quot; Eden 
makes an effort to change public perception of people with disabilities through 
publications (including books, short promotional films, videotapes,TV and radio 
programs) and outreach activities. In addition to vocational training, Eden 
offers professional training, employment assistance, psychological counseling, 
legal representation, religious services, physical examinations and many other 
services to people with disabilities (Her, 1999).</p> 
<h2>Communication Between Consumers and Service Providers</h2> 
<p>Sung (1985) found that the language barrier was the problem most commonly 
cited by the immigrant Chinese. Language is the conduit through which we 
interact with other people. It is the means by which we think, learn, and 
express ourselves. Although many immigrants have learned some English either 
formally or through their exposure to it via the media, most are fluent only in 
their native tongues (Hernandez &amp; Isaacs, 1998). To complicate the 
situation, there are many different dialects in the Chinese language.</p> 
<p>When the author began working as a case manager many years ago, she was 
asked to interpret for a Chinese family. Knowing Mandarin and a couple of other 
Chinese dialects, she went into the meeting with confidence. As soon as the 
conversation started, however she realized that she did not understand a word 
the Chinese family was saying. She even asked whether they were actually 
Chinese. Later she learned that the family only spoke Hakka, a Taiwanese 
dialect. This experience taught her a good lesson. Any health care professional 
seeking Chinese interpreter(s) should first , find out what dialect(s) the 
consumer and/or family speak. Many Chinese immigrants are 
multilingual&ndash;fluent in the official language, a local dialect and English 
as well.</p> 
<p>Hernandez &amp; Isaacs (1988) pointed out that members of an immigrant 
family settling into a new community will learn English at different rates, so 
there might be many levels of English fluency within a family. Hernandez &amp; 
Isaacs (1998, p.255) commented that &quot;it is often tempting to resort to the 
use of English in these situations, but doing so may undermine service 
providers' rapport with parents and may be interpreted by the parents as 
dismissal of their culture of origin.&quot;</p> 
<p>It is always helpful for providers to take the time to learn as much as 
possible about the family's unique cultural and linguistic backgrounds. Though 
taking the time up front maybe difficult for the provider(s) and may even cause 
conflict with some agencies' policies, the knowledge and understanding that 
follows will help the provider build a trusting and helping relationship with 
the individual or family and make more effective services provision possible.
</p> 
<p>Besides language barriers, Chinese and Americans differ in their styles of 
communication. Chinese in general communicate less directly and less explicitly 
and their communication often relies on body movements, facial expressions, eye 
messages and other non&ndash;verbal signals (Engholm, 1994). Interpreting 
nonverbal expressions can be quite difficult, however. Chinese may have 
completely different meanings for nonverbal expressions than Americans. For 
instance, to most Americans, smiling generally means agreement, a positive 
reaction and liking. The Chinese may smile when they feel embarrassed or shy, 
however. Engholm (1994) noted that direct eye contact may be taken as an 
intimidation tactic by the Chinese, while the American makes eye contact to 
indicate he is giving the Chinese his full attention. Americans are taught to 
look at others when speaking to them. Americans view eye contact as an 
indication of mutual understanding and trust. For the Chinese, looking a 
superior or an elderly person directly in the eye indicates disobedience and 
threat.</p> 
<p>Sue &amp; Sue (1999) discussed the concept of high&ndash;low context 
communication proposed by Hall (1976). A high&ndash;context (HC) communication 
emphasizes the physical or social context of the situation and relies heavily 
on nonverbal cues and identification or understanding shared by the 
communicators.</p> 
<p>&quot;In traditional Asian society, many interactions are understandable 
only in light of high&ndash;context cues and situations&quot; (Sue &amp; Sue, 
1999,p. 82). For example, if you have dinner at a traditional Chinese home, the 
host will on numerous occasions offer you drinks and food to show hospitality 
and sincerity. The host will not accept no for an answer and will continue to 
offer the fine food/drinks until the end of the dinner. It is expected that the 
guest will turn down the offers to show his politeness.</p> 
<p>Another example relates to the Chinese way of greeting. The author's 
friend, a third&ndash;generation Italian American, used to complain to her 
about a Chinese neighbor &quot;Mei,&quot; who would always ask her &quot;did 
you eat?&quot; and &quot;where are you going&quot; every time she saw her. The 
friend would say to the author &quot;why is Mei so nosey? Why does she have to 
know everywhere I go? Why does she ask me ten times a day whether I ate or not? 
I am Italian, alright, but that doesn't mean I eat ten times a day.&quot;</p> 
<p>For many Chinese, asking &quot;did you eat?&quot; or &quot;where are you 
heading?&quot; is a way of greeting or starting a conversation, as when 
Americans say &quot;how are you today?&quot;</p> 
<p>The United States is a low&ndash;context (LC) culture. LC cultures place 
emphasis on the verbal part of the communication (Hall, 1976, Sue &amp; Sue, 
1999).LC cultures are associated with opportunism, being more 
individual&ndash;than group&ndash;oriented and greater focused on rules of law 
and procedures (Smith, 1981, Sue &amp; Sue, 1999). Sue &amp; Sue (1999) believe 
that Asian Americans, African Americans, Hispanics, American Indians and some 
other minority groups in the United States emphasize High&ndash;Context (HC) 
cues. A misunderstanding ofHC and LC orientations can lead to conflicts of 
interest since communicators from these two types of culture often do not 
understand each other.</p> 
<p>When dealing with criticism, LC white Americans are more likely to be 
direct, upfront and get right to the point. Conversely, their Chinese 
counterparts (withHC orientation) may view such behavior as rude and blunt. 
Since the Chinese tend to go to extremes so as not to offend or embarrass 
others, they may seem ambiguous or &quot;wishy&ndash;washy.&quot;</p> 
<p>Chinese people are often shy, especially in an unfamiliar environment 
(Chin, 1996). Gentle and friendly tones of greetings are helpful. It is more 
appropriate to address older consumers and/or family members by &quot;Mr. or 
Mrs.&quot; as it can be viewed as disrespectful to address older people by 
their first names. Be aware that married women from mainland China generally 
carry their maiden names. If a consumer's parents or other older relatives are 
participating in a conversation or meeting with a rehabilitation counselor, it 
is extremely important to give the older family members equal attention while 
discussing the care of the younger family member.</p> 
<p>Sue &amp; Sue (1999) compared communication style differences among Asian 
Americans, both white and black in Table 3. The description of the 
Asian&ndash;American way of communication can apply to that of the Chinese. It 
is important for us to consider the above&ndash;mentioned general Chinese 
communication styles since they may affect our perception and ability to work 
with Chinese consumers, but it is equally important to remember that these 
style differences are generalization(s) of traditional cultural/communication 
behaviors and will not apply to every individual of a specific background.</p>

Practice&quot; (Third edition,p. 89) by D.W. Sue &amp; D. Due, 1999.</p> 
<h2>Role of Family</h2> 
<p>The roles of members of a Chinese family are highly interdependent (Ong, 
1993). Traditionally the family has been the most fundamental and important 
unit of society among the Chinese and this is still true. The family is also an 
important economic unit. In today's China, it is still very common for three 
generations to live under one roof. Lam (1992) notes that Confucian philosophy 
advocates the virtue of sacrificing individual needs for the good of the group.
</p> 
<p>Parents are the highest authority in the family. To maintain family 
harmony, child rearing focuses on obedience, proper conduct, control of emotion 
and personal desire, moral training, impulse control, achievement and the 
acceptance of social obligations. Chinese are brought up to remain an integral 
part of their families throughout their lives, instead of being trained to 
function independently (Bond, 1986).</p> 
<p>The Chinese are willing to sacrifice for family members. They tend to seek 
help from immediate and extended family first, before turning to neighbors, 
communities and professionals. Seeking help, such as social welfare and 
benefits from the government, can be very intimidating. Since respect for the 
elders and filial piety are so important, it would be wise for rehabilitation 
professionals to establish a working relationship with parents or significant 
extended family members. Their involvement will be vital to the success of the 
rehabilitation process (Ong, 1993).</p> 
<p>There are contemporary Chinese&ndash;American families who are 
&quot;Americanized&quot; but still hold some traditional values. While it is 
important for American professionals to have knowledge of the Chinese 
traditional values and family structure, it is also important for us to 
recognize that economic and political changes in mainland China, Taiwan, and 
Hong Kong have had a dramatic impact on Chinese family system and values. As a 
result of the Communist takeover of mainland China in 1949, Confucian thought 
and religion were banned. A one&ndash;child per family policy has replaced the 
traditional extended family system (Lee, 1996) and the ten&ndash;year Cultural 
Revolution caused many families to suffer forced separation. Filial piety and 
respect for the elderly were seriously questioned by Red Guard youths. In 
recent years, the open&ndash;door policy and the economic boom in China have 
brought another wave of Western influence and urbanization (Lee, 1996) which 
have placed additional stress on traditional families..</p> 
<p>Outside the mainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan underwent rapid growth in light 
industries and exports after World WarII. The forces of industrialization 
westernization, urbanization, and economic affluence brought a change in their 
social and family structures. While older&ndash; and middle&ndash;generation 
Chinese still maintain some traditional beliefs and practices, the younger 
generation has tended to reject conservatism and traditionalism (Lee, 1996).</p>
<p>Lee (1996) emphasizes that as a result of the social, political and 
economic changes described above, there is no one &quot;typical&quot; Chinese 
family. Although most families share many of the same beliefs and traditions 
but also have their differences and variations in values.</p> 
<h3>Case Study 1</h3> 
<p>Zhang (1994) used the following case study to argue that American 
counseling is deeply rooted in individualism often at the expenses of family 
and community. He questioned the suitability of American counseling strategies 
for other cultures.</p> 
<p>Carol, 29 years of age, blames herself for her family's tension and 
dissension. Her father is out of work and depressed most of the time. Her 
mother feels overburdened and ineffective. In the past, Carol has assumed 
responsibility for her family's problems and has done a great deal for her 
parents. However, she is convinced that if she were more hardworking and 
competent, most of her family problems would diminish greatly. The fact that 
she is increasingly unable to effectively change bothers her. Therefore, she is 
asking for counseling help.</p> 
<p>Zhang's (1994) American classmates all maintained that Carol was too 
submissive and should not continue to put family interests above her own. They 
encouraged Carol to think of her own needs first, leave her family, live alone 
and make sure not to let her parents override her wishes. They also suggested 
assertiveness training for Carol.</p> 
<p>Zhang (1994), a counselor from China, could not understand why putting the 
family's interests before one's own is considered not correct or 
&quot;normal&quot; in the American culture. According to the Chinese culture, a 
morally responsible son or daughter bears the duty of taking care of parents, 
even if it means sacrifice. To Zhang, it would be extremely selfish for Carol 
to leave when her family is in such need of her. In China, that kind of 
assertiveness is considered aggressive and immoral. Zhang thought the parents 
were the ones who needed change, not the daughter. He thought the parents 
needed to be more sensitive to their daughter's needs and more aware of the 
difficulties they had caused her. Zhang suggested inviting Carol's parents to 
come in for a family session. If the client feared that her parents would not 
tolerate having an &quot;outsider&quot; involved in this family matter, Zhang 
suggested inviting the client's relatives or friends to come in and discuss 
intervention strategies they could use to help the parents come to terms of the 
difficulties they have caused their daughter. Zhang reasoned that in Chinese 
culture, it is all right for an individual to stand up for one's own rights, 
however, one needs to do it in an indirect, subtle way, especially when dealing 
with one's elders, lest it cause others to &quot;lose face.&quot;</p> 
<h3>Case Study 2</h3> 
<p>Jim is a 24 year&ndash;old, single male of Chinese descent. Jim was born in 
mainland China and immigrated to the United States with his parents in 1997. 
Jim's primary language is Cantonese. He also speaks Mandarin and is able to 
communicate about basic needs in English. Jim's only sister was not granted 
immigration status and therefore, still resides in Guang Dong (Canton), China. 
When he first came to theU.S., Jim had several jobs, such as waiting tables in 
Chinese restaurants and delivering newspapers for a Chinese newspaper company 
in New York City.</p> 
<p>In July, 1998, one year after he came to the U.S., Jim's truck was struck 
by another truck and he sustained traumatic brain injury (TBI) as well as 
physical disabilities. He remained in coma for over six weeks. After emerging 
from coma, Jim was transferred from the hospital to a local medical center for 
inpatient rehabilitation. After two months of intensive rehabilitation, Jim was 
transferred to a skilled nursing facility with aTBI unit for extended care and 
further rehabilitation. Jim is geared to moving back to the community and back 
to work so he can help support his mother financially.</p> 
<p>Jim's father was so disturbed by the accident that he returned to mainland 
China for psychiatric treatment. Jim's mother has to work seven days a week 
(five days a week in a Chinese restaurant and two days as a home attendant for 
a Chinese home care agency) to earn a living. Jim is determined to go back to 
work and has stated that if returning home with his mother means adding to her 
burden, he would rather remain in the nursing home for the rest of his life. He 
is also eager to help his sister immigrate to theU.S. and was referred to a 
local Chinese agency that handles immigration matters. His social worker made a 
referral to the Department of Health Traumatic Brain Injury Home and 
Community&ndash;Based Medicaid Waiver program. With the social worker's help, 
Jim chose a waiver service coordinator, who put a service plan together for 
community re&ndash;entry and worked with theTBI program's housing locator to 
find an apartment for him.</p> 
<p>The plan was for Jim to move with his mother into a two&ndash;bedroom 
apartment. Jim told the service coordinator that he wanted to live in a 
specific neighborhood in Brooklyn, New York, which is a predominantly 
African&ndash;American neighborhood. He selected that neighborhood was because 
his uncle and aunt resided there.</p> 
<p>The housing locator was able to locate a spacious 2&ndash;bedroom apartment 
in the exact area Jim requested. When Jim's mother learned about this, however, 
she was very upset. She had never wanted to live there and she felt that as the 
head of the household, she had been left out of the picture.</p> 
<p>She stressed that she wanted to live only in a Chinese neighborhood where 
she would be able to communicate since she does not speak a word of English. 
With that in mind, the service coordinator and housing locator started working 
with both Jim and his mother utilizing Chinese interpreters. The housing 
locator also started working with Chinese brokers and landlords in Chinese 
communities. Jim and his mother's questions were answered in Chinese and in a 
written format to allow them to comprehend, digest and refer to this 
information when convenient.</p> 
<p>This case illustrates several lessons that should be kept in mind when 
providing services to consumers born in China:</p> 
<ol> 
<li>Find persons who speak the consumer's and family members' native language 
to work with them. If it is impossible to find providers who speak their native 
language, work through translators/interpreters.</li> 
<li>Understand the consumer's family structure and work around it. It is as 
important to work with the family, especially the caretaker and main advocate, 
as with the consumer himself/herself. Conduct meetings that involve the family, 
especially the older generation.</li> 
<li>Explore services within the family's ethnic community. The city and county 
departments of health and Mayor's office of large cities usually have a 
department of minority or emerging majority affairs where you maybe able to 
obtain resource information about a specific ethnic group.</li> 
<li>Refer the consumer and family to community organizations where staff speak 
their language and are able to address such special issues as immigration with 
which you may not be familiar.</li> 
<li>Provide the consumer and family with as many written materials in their 
native language as you can find or have a translator translate basic 
information about program offerings into their native tongue.</li> </ol> 
<h2>Role of Community</h2> 
<p>Confucian philosophy advocates that individuals put group needs above 
personal needs. Chinese have a strong sense of community. In mainland China, 
every large building complex or neighborhood has committees or associations 
formed by voluntary or selected residents &ndash; mostly retired residents or 
housewives &ndash; that address residents' family, environmental, recreational 
and other needs and issues.</p> 
<p>In the example of the mental health system, Kaplan, Sobin, &amp; Andors 
(1979) found that one of the major justifications for keeping China's formal 
mental health care system so small is that there are so many informal avenues 
to help people with the kinds of problems that might, under other 
circumstances, lead them to seek help from a mental health establishment. Among 
the social services provided by these informal committees and association is 
mediation of many family quarrels. Street clinics, the most immediate level of 
health care in urban neighborhoods, also serve as places where people with 
personal problems can go for discussion or help. Medical workers in these 
clinics receive much the same basic training as barefoot doctors of the 
Cultural Revolution era. Although their training in mental health is minimal 
their sympathetic ear is often what's needed to help solve everyday personal 
problems. More serious problems are referred to the local clinic or hospital. 
The informal system of problem solving has minimized the need for formal 
treatment (Kaplan, Sobin, &amp; Andors, 1979).</p> 
<p>The sense of being part of something greater than oneself gives the Chinese 
a feeling of belonging and security. They know that they do not stand alone 
(Sung, 1985). Lee (1996) believes that the community association model provides 
the psychological services of an extended family to many Chinese immigrants. In 
order to survive and make a better living in a foreign land, Chinese immigrants 
form many unique communities where they all speak the same language, shop at 
Chinese supermarkets or stores and have an understanding of each other's 
religion, culture, and beliefs. Each of these communities has advocacy groups, 
churches/temples, and non&ndash;profit organizations that address immigration, 
legal, medical, educational, disability, vocational, and many other needs. Due 
to their unfamiliarity with and lack of understanding of western medicine 
and/or the medical, social and rehabilitation system, community members prefer 
to seek medical help first from a Chinese doctor in their community. Some feel 
nervous, even skeptical when referred to an American medical professional 
outside that community.</p> 
<h3>Case Study 3</h3> 
<p>Joe is a 55&ndash;year&ndash;old man who sustained a traumatic brain injury 
(TBI) from a gunshot wound when he was mugged on the way home from work in 
1991. He is of Chinese descent and immigrated to theU.S. in his high school 
years. He lived with his parents and sister in an apartment he now shares with 
his sister, as both his parents are deceased, his mother, one year after he 
sustained hisTBI. Joe worked in the food service industry prior to his injury 
and is extremely eager to resume work. He speaks Cantonese andChao Shang 
dialect with his sister at home but also speaks English fairly well. Since his 
injury, his younger and only sister Sue has been his primary caretaker and 
advocate. She is very involved in Joe's care but often feels a lack of support 
from social workers and therapists. She commented that the social worker at the 
hospital told her to apply for benefits and services on her own, saying, 
&quot;You speak English very well. You can do all this.&quot; Sue feels that 
she really doesn't understand the medical, rehabilitation or social systems and 
is at a loss when dealing with all the jargon. She is often depressed since she 
has been struggling to do her best, but feels she gets little cooperation and 
appreciation from Joe. Joe, on the other hand, is very frustrated about his 
dependence on his younger sister. As the older brother he thinks he should 
support the family and be the one to give orders. He cannot accept the fact 
that due to his memory loss, he has to depend on Sue to remind him to do things 
and give him advice. As a result, Joe often yells at Sue, &quot;I don't need 
you telling me what to do!&quot; He uses his sister as outlet for his anger 
since as he has nowhere else to release his temper. Joe and his sister fight 
all the time but are inseparable.</p> 
<p>Joe's main focus is to get a job. Because he is so eager to be gainfully 
employed, he tends to put considerations of all his cognitive, medical and 
physical limitations aside. This hinders his vocational rehabilitation. His 
service providers and vocational counselors find it very difficult to work with 
him since they can neither set realistic goals with him nor motivate him to 
achieve one step at a time. They complain that Joe wants to find a paid job 
right away but does not want to go through any training. Joe feels, however, 
that no one ever clearly explained in language and terms he can understand, why 
the training is so essential.</p> 
<p>Joe lost all his former friends after his injury but he has been visiting 
Chinatown on a daily basis and has formed some new &quot;tea friends,&quot; 
friends with whom he drinks tea and chats. He does not trust or like most of 
his service providers. One of the few providers with whom he relates well is 
his primary care physician (PCP), a Chinese doctor in Chinatown. This doctor 
has limited knowledge about the identification, treatment and resources forTBI, 
however, Joe's service coordinator thought that Joe would be better served by a 
doctor who specializes in working with individuals withTBI. So she changed his 
PCP to an American doctor who specializes in TBI. After seeing his new PCP 
once, Joe asked to be transferred back to his Chinese doctor since he felt much 
more comfortable with her.</p> 
<p>Joe was confused about many referrals his new PCP had made on his behalf. 
Even though he was had been assured of the good intentions of his new doctor 
and the purpose of the exams, Joe strongly felt that he had been better 
informed by his Chinese doctor and could trust only her. A couple of weeks 
later, Joe was transferred back to his ChinesePCP which pleased him and his 
sister. At present, Joe would like to move out of his current apartment and 
live by himself within a Chinese community.</p> 
<p>This case illustrates several good lessons:</p> 
<ol> 
<li>Do not assume that immigrants who came to this country decades ago and 
speak English well know the American medical, social and rehabilitation concept 
or systems well. This may not be the case.</li> 
<li>Be aware of family structure and conflicts. Find out what shapes the 
structure of the family and what causes the conflict.</li> 
<li>Acknowledge culture as a predominant force in shaping behaviors. According 
to the Chinese tradition, the oldest son of the family is considered the head 
of the household particularly if the father is deceased. He is expected to take 
charge of everything. It is considered extremely shameful for an older brother 
to depend on his younger sister for a living and for advice.</li> 
<li>Be sensitive and understanding of the consumers' needs and be respectful 
of their choices. As a professional, it is very tempting to refer the consumer 
to the best medical professionals and services you know. It is important, 
however, to find out from the consumer which medical professionals he/she 
wants. Your consumer may want remain with a doctor with whom he or she feels 
comfortable and who speaks the same language even if that doctor is not be the 
expert you prefer. Find a way to involve the doctor the consumer chooses 
instead of forcing the consumer to change.</li> 
<li>Be aware of the consumer's community and try to find services within that 
community.</li> 
<li>Acknowledge that cultural differences can have an impact on service 
delivery. In this case, being the oldest son and the only surviving man in the 
family, Joe's strong desire to work and be the family bread winner could hinder 
his vocational and rehabilitation process. Counseling could address his issue, 
his role in the family and his expectations related to vocational services.</li>
</ol> 
<h2>Role of Religion</h2> 
<p>China is a multi&ndash;religious country. The majority Han nationality, the 
largest ethnic group in mainland China, practices Buddhism, Christianity and 
Taoism (China Today, 2000) and all Chinese are greatly influenced by 
Confucianism as well. Chinese philosophies promote harmony. Taoism and 
Buddhism, the most popular religions in China, have some differences between 
them but no conflicts (Lam, 2000). Based on Dao De Jin, Taoism promotes the 
belief that a person will gain power and strength if he/she behaves in harmony 
with the nature of universe and will suffer later in life if he/she acts 
against the nature of the universe (Lam, 2000).</p> 
<p>For instance, mental illness is viewed as being caused by deeds from past 
lives or acts against the nature of the universe. In traditional Chinese 
medicine, humankind is viewed as a microcosm within a universal macrocosm. The 
energy in each human being interrelates with the energy of the universe. If 
there is imbalance of the yin and yang, then the immune system of the body is 
disturbed and the body is susceptible to illness. (Lee, 1996).</p> 
<p>In Lam's (2000) analysis, Confucianism is the philosophy that guides 
Chinese in governing behavior. It emphasizes the importance of family and 
social order (i.e., children must respect and be obligated to their parents and 
grandparents; junior follows the senior; servants serve the rulers, and so on).
</p> 
<p>Buddhism was introduced to China from India. Lam (2000) maintains that the 
reason for the wide acceptance of Buddhism in China is the concept of rebirth 
and its reinforcement of the principles of Taoism and Confucianism. Buddhism is 
a man&ndash;centered religion, not god&ndash;centered. It tells people that 
life is suffering. No one but yourself can save you from suffering. Craving is 
believed to be the cause of all sufferings. To overcome happiness, one must 
overcome craving, desire, or endless wanting, hatred and complaints.</p> 
<p>Many Chinese are Buddhists and attend occasional services, practice 
rituals, and visit a temple on a regular basis. It has been estimated that more 
than 68 million Chinese still consider themselves Buddhists, though it is not 
likely that they all practice the religion regularly (Compton's Living 
Encyclopedia, 1995).</p> 
<p>Islam was brought to China mainly from central Asia, and by 1995, there 
were believed to be more than four million Chinese Muslims (Compton's Living 
Encyclopedia, 1995). Islam insists that their god is the only god in the 
universe (Lam, 2000). This belief is somewhat contradictory to that of 
Buddhism, but the two religions co&ndash;exist peacefully in China.</p> 
<p>Christianity arrived in China with Jesuit missionaries in the early 
Seventeenth century. It is believed that as many as two million Christians 
practice their faith in China (Compton's Living Encyclopedia, 1995) and a great 
many Chinese converted to Christianity after immigrating to the United States. 
Chinese Americans formed churches/temples within their communities, where they 
worship in English or Chinese, depending n preference.</p> 
<p>It is common for Chinese to honor their ancestors, especially during major 
holidays like the Chinese New Year. Incense burning and the eating of special 
foods usually occurs on special occasions. Good luck symbols may be displayed 
in homes</p> 
<h2>Gender</h2> 
<h3>People's Republic of China</h3> 
<p>The role of women in China changed dramatically when Mao 
&quot;equalized&quot; the sexes immediately following the founding of People's 
Republic China in 1949. Many women were instrumental in the fight to liberate 
the country from the nationalists and from foreign domination and were 
prominent in the party and in the state administration throughout the country.
</p> 
<p>Chinese women hold positions as factory workers and managers in significant 
numbers, although it is still uncommon for a woman to be a general manager or 
board member of a state enterprise or a director of a Chinese institution or 
agency. A growing number of women, however, have become entrepreneurs. The 
self&ndash;perception of Chinese women may be the most noticeable psychological 
change in China since the open door policy that began at the end of the 80's 
(Engholm, 1994).</p> 
<p>The majority of women who join their husbands in the U.S. are well educated 
and employed in respectable professions in China. These women are usually 
unable to resume their professions in theU.S. due to language and cultural 
barriers, and/or immigration status. Therefore, they may encounter more 
difficulties in acculturation than women who originally held the traditional 
roles of housewife and mother (Liu, 1997). Because of their educational and 
professional backgrounds, however, such women are more susceptible to western 
medicine, medical and rehabilitation systems. If approached in a positive, 
informative and sensitive way, they will be very supportive and involved in the 
treatment and/or rehabilitation process.</p> 
<p>There is also a limited number of well&ndash;educated women whose English 
proficiency is at a level that allows them to pursue advanced education or 
careers similar to those they had in China. These women tend to adapt to 
American society quickly and successfully. Hence they are more independent and 
better informed and are likely to be active advocates for a loved one in need.
</p> 
<h3>Taiwan</h3> 
<p>Taiwanese women have been struggling for their independence and equality 
for about 20 years. Statistics indicate that their status has improved 
impressively. The increase in the percentage of college&ndash;educated women is 
greater than that of men (seven percent versus five percent). In the economic 
sphere, more and more women maintain jobs after they are married. The ratio of 
white&ndash;collar to blue&ndash;collar women is about one to one. The growth 
in the number of women civilian officials is also quite remarkable. Women tend 
to defer marriage and the divorce rate has increased (Rubinstein, 1994). This 
author has encountered many women from Taiwan who joined their husbands in the
U.S. over the past few decades. Due to language barriers and lack of 
socialization they often lack knowledge of theU.S. social and medical system 
and tend to depend on their husbands or children to maneuver through the 
rehabilitation system. Those who came here independently to pursue higher 
education are much savvier.</p> 
<h2>Holidays</h2> 
<h3>Official Chinese Holidays</h3> 
<p>(celebrated in the mainland China)</p> 
<h4>New Year's Day (January 1)</h4> 
<p>Employees enjoy a paid day off and families visit each other. There are 
parties everywhere, &ndash; in parks, dancing halls and universities, where 
students will soon leave for their winter vacation.</p> 
<h4>International Women's Day (March 8)</h4> 
<p>Women employees get a whole or a half paid day&ndash;off to celebrate 
women's independence.</p> 
<h4>Tree&ndash;Planting Day (April 1)</h4> 
<p>This day has been highly promoted since the late 70s by the reformist 
government but has yet to be firmly established. It marks the beginning of the 
annual campaign for a &quot;green nation.&quot;</p> 
<h4>International Labor Day (May 1)</h4> 
<p>Employees enjoy a paid day off. A large number of urban citizens visit 
parks as a family to celebrate.</p> 
<h4>Youth Day (May 4)</h4> 
<p>This is a day that marks the first mass student movement in 1919, a 
movement touched off by the then&ndash;Chinese government, which acquiesced to 
the Japanese government's attempt to colonize Shandong Province. It was also an 
anti&ndash;Confucian movement as well as one that promoted western scientific 
and democratic ideas.</p> 
<h4>Children's Day (June 1)</h4> 
<p>With the establishment of the &quot;one couple, one child&quot; policy, 
this day is emphasized more than ever before. This is a happy and memorable day 
for Chinese children. Kids of all ages dress in their best and enjoy all kinds 
of entertainment in places such as movie theatres, parks, children's museums 
and palaces, which are open to them for free.</p> 
<h4>The Chinese Communist Party's Birthday (July 1)</h4> 
<p>This marks the founding of the Chinese Communist Party in 1921 in Shanghai 
and is usually characterized by front&ndash;page editorials in major government 
newspapers.</p> 
<h4>Army Day (August 1)</h4> 
<p>A communist&ndash;led army staged the first armed uprising in Chinese 
communist history against the Nationalists on August 1, 1927. This event is 
regarded as the beginning of the Red Army (later the People's Liberation Army). 
Now the anniversary is often used to promote better relationships between the 
army and the civilians, relationships believed to have helped defeat the 
Nationalists in the 1949 civil war.</p> 
<h4>Teacher's Day (September 1)</h4> 
<p>It was started in the early eighties as an effort to reverse the 
anti&ndash;intellectual sentiment nurtured by the &quot;Cultural 
Revolution.&quot; Students usually give teachers cards with personal 
expressions to thank them for their hard work.</p> 
<h4>National Day (October 1)</h4> 
<p>This is the anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China 
in 1949. There used to be grand parades at famous squares in major cities, the 
largest and most famous of which was the Tiananmen Square parade. Now 
celebrations usually take the form of parties in amusement parks by day and 
fire&ndash;works and grand television programs at night. Employees enjoy two 
paid days off.</p> 
<h3>Chinese Traditional Holidays</h3> 
<p>The calendar the Chinese traditional holidays follow is organized according 
to a unique lunar&ndash;solar system, different from the western calendar.</p> 
<h4>Spring Festival (The Chinese New Year) (first day of the first month)</h4> 
<p>This is the biggest and most celebrated festival in China and sections of 
east and southeast Asia. The Chinese New Year is popularly known as the Spring 
Festival because it marks the beginning of spring. The new year season extends 
from the mid&ndash;twelfth month of the previous year to the middle of the 
first month of the New Year. Just December in America, this is the best 
business season of the year and people will pour out their money to buy 
presents, decorations, food and clothing. Many people will travel home for a 
family reunion from all parts of the country.</p> 
<p>Days before the new year begins, every family is busy giving the house a 
thorough cleaning, to sweep away all the ill&ndash;fortune there may be in the 
family and make way for good luck in the new year.. They decorate the doors and 
windows with paper&ndash;cutouts and posters with the popular themes of 
&quot;happiness,&quot; &quot;wealth,&quot; &quot;longevity&quot; and 
&quot;satisfactory marriage with more children.&quot;</p> 
<p>The eve of the new year is very carefully observed. Supper is a feast, with 
all family members together. After dinner, the whole family sits up for the 
night while having fun playing cards or board games or watchingTV programs 
dedicated to the occasion. At midnight, the whole sky will be lit up by 
fireworks and firecrackers.</p> 
<p>Very early the next morning, children greet their parents and receive &quot;
Hong Boa,&quot; cash wrapped up in red paper packages. Then the family sets out 
to offer greetings to their relatives and neighbors. During and several days 
following the new year's day, people visit each other and exchange gifts. 
Advice for medical, social and rehabilitation personnel: avoid scheduling any 
meetings and/or appointments during this holiday season,i.e., a couple of days 
before and a few days after the Spring Festival.</p> 
<h4>Lantern Festival (fifteenth of the first month)</h4> 
<p>The Lantern Festival marks the end of the New Year season. The spirit 
underlying the diverse celebrations of the Chinese New Year is the same: a 
sincere wish of peace and happiness for the family members and friends. Lantern 
exhibits, lion and dragon dances, and eatingTang Yuan (ball&ndash;shaped boiled 
sweet sticky rice dumplings with delicious fillings) mark this day.</p> 
<h4>Qing Ming (means &quot;Pure &amp; Bright&quot; in Chinese) (fifth of the 
24 Solar Terms)</h4> 
<p>Originally this was a celebration of spring. People customarily went on an 
excursion to &quot;ta Qing&quot; (step on grass). Later it became the day 
dedicated to late loved ones. Tidying up ancestor's tombs is its major event.
</p> 
<h4>Duan Wu (Dragon Boat) Festival (fifth of the fifth month)</h4> 
<p>This festival is said to honor the memory of Qu Yuan, a great patriot poet 
of the State of Chu during the Warring States period (475&ndash;221BC). Qu Yuan 
drowned himself to protest the actions of his emperor who had given in to the 
bully state of Chin. For fear that fish might consume his body, the people of 
Chu rowed their boats to the place of his death and threw rice dumplings 
wrapped in bamboo leaves into the river to feed the fish. Now the big event of 
dragon boat contest is a legacy of such activity. People still eat rice 
dumplings wrapped in bamboo&ndash;leaves on that day.</p> 
<h4>The Seventh Eve (seventh of the seventh month)</h4> 
<p>This originates from a beautiful legend about a cow herder and a fairy who 
were cruelly separated but reunite once each year, making this a happy and sad 
occasion.</p> 
<h4>Mid&ndash;Autumn Festival (fifteenth of the eighth month)</h4> 
<p>This is somewhat like the American Thanksgiving as it is a day for the 
entire family to gather together. Instead of turkey, the Chinese family feasts 
on good wine, moon&ndash;cakes and other delicacies. More romantic than 
Thanksgiving, the whole family feasts under the fullest and brightest moon of 
the year. There is also an interesting story behind this. Folklore tells of a 
beautiful fairy living on the moon in a spacious but cold crystal palace with 
her sole companion, a jade rabbit. A heavenly general and friend would 
occasionally pay her a visit, bringing along fragrant wine. She would then 
dance a breathtaking dance.</p> 
<p>Note: Edited from Haiwang Yuan's web page.</p> 
<h2>Food Practices</h2> 
<h3>Usual meal pattern</h3> 
<p>Chinese usually eat three meals a day, the largest at dinner (Chin, 1996). 
There is a traditional saying among the Chinese: &quot;eat well in the morning, 
eat full at noon and eat well in the evening.&quot;</p> 
<h3>Special utensils</h3> 
<p>Chopsticks. The Chinese family usually shares all the dishes.</p> 
<h3>Food beliefs and rituals</h3> 
<p>Food is viewed as important in maintaining balance of Yin (cold) and Yang 
(hot) in the body. Imbalance ofyin and yang is believed to cause illness. For 
instance, consuming cold fluid while having oily food is believed to cause 
diarrhea.Yin foods include fruits, vegetables, cold liquids and beer. Yang 
foods include meats, eggs, hot fluids and oily and fried foods. Some foods are 
used to treat illness or disease (Chin, 1996).</p> 
<h3>Usual Diet</h3> 
<p>The northern Chinese favor wheat and flour products while southerners 
prefer rice and noodles. Meat usually is not eaten in large quantities and beef 
is cooked until well done. Vegetables are frequently mixed with meat to 
maintain the balance ofYin and Yang. Chinese prefer vegetables cooked, not raw. 
(Chin, 1996).</p> 
<h3>Fluids</h3> 
<p>Chinese people drink plenty of hot liquids, especially tea and chicken 
soup, when sick. Hot beverages are preferred due to belief that cold water 
shocks the system (Chin, 1996). Sick people with fever and/or stomach problems 
are advised to avoid cold fluid and food. It is forbidden for a mother who just 
gave birth to a baby to drink ice water. Traditionally, the mother is not 
allowed to drink or eat anything cold for the first month after she gives birth.
</p> 
<h2>Recommendations to Rehabilitation Service Providers</h2> 
<h3>Be Aware of Cultural Variables That Affect Clinical Practice</h3> 
<p>The contrasting concepts of the Western individualistic (i.e., independent) 
versus the Chinese collectivistic (i.e., interdependent) orientations have a 
strong impact on providing rehabilitation services to Chinese&ndash;Americans 
with disabilities. The client&ndash; centered approach used by many 
rehabilitation counselors in the United States may create discomfort and 
confusion for some Chinese consumers since this approach lacks the structure 
that they may expect and are used to. Moreover, Chinese&ndash;Americans tend to 
view counselors as authorities and expect them to help or simply solve their 
problems for them as opposed to offering empathy and nurturance through the 
counseling experience. Since rehabilitation counselors may be viewed as 
authority figures and Chinese culture emphasizes controlling one's emotions, it 
may be very difficult for Chinese consumers to initiate conversations (Chan, 
Lam, Wong, Leung, &amp; Fang, 1988). Chanet al. (1988, p. 23) concluded that 
&quot;these different expectations of counseling and low levels of 
self&ndash;disclosure and emotional expressions are often in direct conflict 
with the expectations of individual western therapists.&quot;</p> 
<p>The language barrier is another problem when counseling ChineseAmericans in 
light of the verbal interaction and rapport building function of the counseling 
relationship (Chan, Lam, Wong, Leung, &amp; Fang, 1988). Interpreters can help 
with this issue but greater success maybe ensured if the service provider bears 
in mind the recommendations listed below.</p> 
<h3>Recommendations</h3> 
<ol> 
<li>
<h4>Accessing the Community</h4> When accessing the community beware of the 
following:<br>
&nbsp; 
<ul> 
<li>There are sub&ndash;cultures within the general Chinese culture. That is, 
there are differences between people who originated in Hong Kong versus those 
who originated in mainland China or Taiwan. In addition, the cultural 
values/beliefs can be quite different between first&ndash;, second&ndash;, 
third&ndash;, and fourth&ndash; generation Chinese Americans. Questions such as 
&quot;which part of China did you come from?&quot; or &quot;how long have you 
been in theU.S.?&quot; are important to ask because China consists of so many 
varieties of linguistic, cultural, political, economics, health and 
rehabilitation systems.</li> 
<li>There are differences in the availability of community organizations to 
minority groups in urban and rural areas (OMRDD, 1994). There are dozens of 
Chinese organizations, associations and groups in New York City, for instance, 
but rarely will you find any in most rural areas, even in places close to large 
cities.</li> 
<li>Hire Mandarin/Cantonese speaking staff directly from the communities in 
need.</li> 
<li>Use Chinese media, such as Chinese newspapers, radio stations and TV 
channels when conducting outreach.</li> 
<li>Conduct outreach in schools, senior centers and churches/temples.</li> 
<li>Collaborate with existing community organizations and service providers.
</li> 
<li>Develop educational materials to be distributed to community 
members/organizations in the Chinese language.</li> </ul> </li> 
<li>
<h4>Accessing Family</h4> 
<ul> 
<li>Involve family members in the intake and treatment/rehabilitation process. 
Keep family members well&ndash;informed of the process.</li> 
<li>Provide services to families in ways that do not conflict with their 
beliefs, customs, and cultural values (OMRDD, 1994).</li> 
<li>Be aware of differences in cultural beliefs, traditions, religions and 
values.</li> 
<li>Work with interpreters and/or translators. These professionals should have 
both bilingual and bi&ndash;cultural skills as well as knowledge of 
rehabilitation vocabulary and concepts so that they can provide accurate 
translation. It is highly recommended that service providers meet with the 
interpreter before meetings with consumer/family to keep the interpreter 
abreast of the purpose and content of the meeting, familiarize them with 
relevant terminology and obtain information about acceptable communication 
(both verbal &amp; nonverbal) that may be appropriate for the particular 
consumer/family.</li> 
<li>Expand family care programs to include relatives as providers (OMRDD, 
1994).</li> 
<li>Promote respite, camping and recreational programs that are sensitive to 
cultural needs of Chinese communities (OMRDD, 1994).</li> </ul> </li> 
<li>
<h4>Accessing Individuals</h4> 
<ul> 
<li>Recognize individual differences. Be careful not to make stereotypical 
assumptions about a consumer who is of Chinese heritage.</li> 
<li>Provide bilingual services. Languages differ among the cultural groups and 
within the cultural groups. It is highly important to acknowledge and respect 
the dialectal differences among Chinese people (OMRDD, 1994).</li> 
<li>Be aware of interpersonal skills and non&ndash;verbal communication cues (
OMRDD, 1994). For instance, when invited into Chinese homes and offered 
something to eat or drink, remember that it is considered impolite to say no.
</li> 
<li>Promote consumer participation in choice of services.</li> </ul> </li> 
<li>
<h4>Simplify process and protocols (OMRDD, 1994)</h4></li> </ol>
