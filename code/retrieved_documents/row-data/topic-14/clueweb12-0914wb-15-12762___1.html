<h1>Chinese herbal medicine</h1> 
<p>In herbal medicine the healing properties of plants are used to treat 
illness and maintain good health. It is one of the most ancient forms of 
treatment known and there are herbal medicine traditions in various parts of 
the world. In Britain today, the two main systems of herbal medicine practised 
are Chinese andWestern.&Acirc;&nbsp;Other forms of herbal medicine practised 
include Ayurvedic (Indian) and Tibetan.</p> 
<h2>What is Chinese herbal medicine?</h2> 
<p>Chinese herbal medicine is part of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), 
which includes acupuncture, massage,<em>tai chi</em> (exercise using controlled 
movement) and<em>qi gong</em> (breathing exercises). Some practitioners are 
trained in, and practise, both Chinese herbal medicine and acupuncture. 
Traditional Chinese medicine is based on the theory that energy (known as<em>qi
</em>, pronounced <em>chee</em>) flows through pathways in the body. Qi 
consists of equal and opposite qualities -<em>yin</em> and <em>yang</em> - and 
when these become unbalanced, illness may result. Practitioners usually 
prescribe a particular mixture of herbs for each patient, aimed at putting the 
balance right and improving the patient&rsquo;s health.</p> 
<h2>What happens during a visit to a practitioner?</h2> 
<p>At the first consultation the practitioner will ask about your current 
health, your history of illnesses, your diet and how you are feeling. They will 
also do a physical examination. Chinese herbal practitioners will usually feel 
your pulses and look at your tongue. The practitioner will then make up a 
prescription. Usually this is done during the consultation.</p> 
<p>The herbs may come as a tincture (a concentrated solution of herbs 
extracted in water and alcohol) or in tablet form. For skin complaints, the 
preparation might be in the form of an ointment. Chinese medicine practitioners 
often use &acirc;&#128;&#152;raw herbs&rsquo;, which have to be boiled in water 
and then drunk as a tea. This is time-consuming for the patient and 
practitioners may give the same prescription as a tincture or freeze dried 
powder instead.</p> 
<p>Herbal medicine practitioners may also give advice about diet and exercise, 
if this is appropriate.</p> 
<p>Your second appointment is likely to be between 2-4 weeks later and the 
length of your course of treatment will depend on the reason you are having 
herbal medicine treatment. The practitioner will probably adjust your herbal 
prescription at times during the course of treatment.</p> 
<h2>What precautions should I take?</h2> 
<p>Herbal medicines, like other medicines, have an effect on the body and 
should be used with care. Sometimes people mistakenly assume that simply 
because a product is natural it must be safe; there are many plants that are 
poisonous to humans. There are some safety issues to be aware of.</p> 
<p>Some herbal medicines can interact with other prescribed medicines, so you 
should not take them at the same time. For example, St John&rsquo;s Wort and 
antidepressants; St John&rsquo;s Wort and drugs for high blood pressure and for 
heart conditions; St John&rsquo;s Wort and anticoagulants such as warfarin; 
ginkgo biloba and anticoagulant drugs.</p> 
<p>Herbal medicines made to poor standards may be a health risk. The Medicines 
and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) is the government body 
responsible for the safety of medicines in the UK. It collects information 
about any harmful effects (called adverse drug reactions) and it has warned the 
public that the standards of production of unlicensed traditional Chinese 
medicines can vary considerably. Some have been found to illegally contain 
pharmaceutical ingredients, heavy metals or toxic herbs. For example, some 
&acirc;&#128;&#152;herbal&rsquo; creams for skin complaints have been found to 
contain steroids that are not listed as ingredients.</p> 
<p>Poor labelling of medicines can be a risk as this can lead to patients 
using the product incorrectly.</p> 
<p>It is important that you discuss all your medical treatments with your 
herbal medicine practitioner and tell your doctor if you are taking or planning 
to take herbal remedies. This is particularly important if you are about to 
have an operation, or have had a liver complaint, or you are pregnant. 
Pharmacists can also give advice on safety.</p> 
<p>If you feel worse or unwell in a different way while taking herbal 
medicines, you should tell your herbal medicine practitioner, your doctor or 
pharmacist straightaway. They can report any harmful effects of medicines, 
including herbal medicines, to the MHRA. To check whether the MHRA has issued 
advice about particular herbal products or ingredients, you can checkHerbal 
Safety News on the MHRA&rsquo;s website. In addition, Phytonet collects 
information about harmful effects of herbal medicines.</p> 
<p>The Medical Toxicology Unit at St Guy&rsquo;s and St Thomas&rsquo; NHS 
Trust suggests that patients ask for a list of the ingredients in any herbal 
product they buy or are given. If they later suffer any ill effects and need 
medical treatment, doctors will know what they have taken.</p> 
<p>In some parts of the world, Chinese medicine practitioners use products 
that are made from endangered species of animals. This is illegal in the UK and 
the ban is strongly supported by the UK herbal medicine profession.</p> 
<p>It has not been easy for members of the public to tell if an unlicensed 
herbal medicine (whether supplied over the counter in a shop or made up by the 
herbal practitioner) has been made to acceptable standards. The MHRA is 
planning changes in regulation and, from autumn 2005 onwards, will run a scheme 
for registering over-the-counter traditional herbal medicines. These products 
will have to meet assured standards of safety, quality and patient information. 
Advice will be available on the MHRA web site on how to identify these products.
</p> 
<p>There are some licensed herbal medicines on the market, which are made to 
assured standards and can be identified by the PL number on the product.</p> 
<p>The MHRA also carried out a consultation in 2004 about possible changes to 
regulations governing unlicensed herbal medicines which are made up by 
practitioners to meet the needs of individual patients. The aim of these 
changes is to give the public greater assurance about standards. The MHRA is 
considering the results of the consultation and information about any further 
developments will be on its website.</p> 
<p>Some herbal remedies should not be taken during pregnancy because if they 
are taken in large amounts there is a possible risk of miscarriage. These 
include feverfew; golden seal; juniper; mistletoe; nutmeg; rosemary and sage. 
It is also advisable not to take any herbal medicines in the first three months 
of pregnancy, unless you are going to see a registered herbal medicine 
practitioner about a specific problem.</p> &nbsp; &nbsp;
