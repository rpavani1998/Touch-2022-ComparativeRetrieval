<p>Ayurvedic remedies are the time-tested procedures that were devised after 
observing their effect on the body. Ayurveda is an age-old health science that 
has a history of 5000 years in developing. Various learned men in ancient India 
made certain remedies and processes that were very effective in providing cure 
to a variety of diseases.</p> 
<p>All these procedures were made from local surrounding vegetation. They 
observed all the actions of a particular herb or a plant after applying it to 
various diseases. Hence a full references and data was generated and then 
documented in various ancient texts. Some of these texts are Charka Samhita, 
Susruta Samhita and Ashtaang samgraha.</p> 
<p>These three books possess the complete ayurvedic remedies along with the 
complete references of diseases and their various signs and symptoms. In these 
texts there is a complete explanation of diseases along with their diagnostic 
methods. After this there is a complete treatment with single herbs and certain 
herbal combinations.</p> 
<p>Below are certain ayurvedic remedies that are very helpful in treating a 
number of diseases with the remedies available around us:</p> 
<p>&middot; Constipation &ndash; for relief from constipation one can use 
triphala powder three to five grams daily with warm water or hot milk. Another 
remedy that is also very effective in treating constipation is castor oil. Take 
castor oil one to two table spoons at night with warm water or milk. This will 
not only helps in relieving the constipation but will also improve your 
digestion. You can also take three to five grams ofHaritaki powder that is also 
a good laxative agent.</p>

treating indigestion.Mint or pudina paste is very effective in treating all 
kinds of indigestion. One table spoon of pudina paste helps in relieving from 
all kind of digestive disorders and a condition of hyperacidity.Cumin seeds are 
another herbal drug that is very effective in treating indigestion. 8 to 10 
seeds with plain water increasing the peristaltic movement and is also very 
helpful in avoiding the feeling of nausea.</p>

arthritis.Ashwagandha is considered as the greatest herb that is very helpful 
in treating pains and inflammation in any part of the body. 3 to 5 grams of

ayurvedic herb that&rsquo;s effectively used in treating the arthritis. A dose 
of 3 grams of Guggul is enough to get relived from pains. Various Guggul 
preparations are available in the market. Some of the Guggul preparations that 
are used are yoga raja Guggul, mahayograja Guggul, kaishore Guggul, 
triyodashang Guggul etc. Shallaki is another herb which is very similar to 
Guggul is also widely used to suppress pain and relive from inflammation.</p> 
<p>&middot; Skin problems &ndash; Whenever there is a talk of skin related 
problems,Neem is the one herb that is most commonly used. It is also known as 
azadirachita indica or margosa in common language. 3 to 5 grams of neem powder

<p>Drug giant Roche has been ordered to pay a 7 million verdict to man who had 
to have his colon removed after taking the popular acne medication Accutane. 
Allegedly the medication caused inflammatory bowel disease, Crohn&rsquo;s 
disease. This is the second loss for Roche in as many trials for Accutane. 
Roche still faces over 400 lawsuits alleging that Accutane caused Crohn&rsquo;s 
disease. An order handed down on February 8th Judge Carol Hugbee upheld the 
multi- million dollar verdict awarded in October.</p>

<p>Try the all natural treatment to this problem.</p> 
<p>Eat 2-3 pieces of fresh fruit every day, and drink at least one full quart 
of water throughout the day as well. Cut back on diuretics like cola, coffee, 
and tea, too. The stuff they sell online and on TV is a bunch of expensive 
crud, IMHO, and you don&rsquo;t need it. After all, mankind evolved eating 
fruits and vegetables &ndash; don&rsquo;t you think that after 200,000 years of 
eating them, our digestive systems would know what to do with them?</p> 
<p>There&rsquo;s truth to that &ldquo;An apple a day&rdquo; saying, and this 
is part of it.</p>

<p>Natural remedies can be very beneficial. Less known side effects and 
poisons from man made ingredients. And, less $$$ spent on a drug with a patent.

<p>Some medical people look to natural remedies when possible.</p>

remedies are right around them. It is always interesting to see the versatility 
of what these plants can cure.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ayurvedic Remedies for Common Health Problems&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Ayurveda is a holistic healing science which comprises of two words, Ayu 
and Veda. Ayu means life and Veda means knowledge or science. So the literal 
meaning of the word Ayurveda is the science of life. Ayurveda is a science 
dealing not only with treatment of some diseases but is a complete way of life.

<p>Benefits of Ayurvedic Medicines</p> 
<p> * By using ayurvedic and herbal medicines you ensure physical and mental 
health without side effects. The natural ingredients of herbs help bring 
&ldquo;arogya&rdquo; to human body and mind. (&ldquo;Arogya&rdquo; means free 
from diseases). The chemicals used in preparing allopathy medicines have impact 
on mind as well. One should have allopathy medicine only when it is very 
necessary.<br>
 * According to the original texts, the goal of Ayurveda is 
prevention as well as promotion of the body&rsquo;s own capacity for 
maintenance and balance.<br>
 * Ayurvedic treatment is non-invasive and 
non-toxic, so it can be used safely as an alternative therapy or alongside 
conventional therapies.<br>
 * Ayurvedic physicians claim that their methods 
can also help stress-related, metabolic, and chronic conditions.<br>
 * 
Ayurveda has been used to treat acne, allergies, asthma, anxiety, arthritis, 
chronic fatigue syndrome, colds, colitis, constipation, depression, diabetes, 
flu, heart disease, hypertension, immune problems, inflammation, insomnia, 
nervous disorders, obesity, skin problems, and ulcers.</p>

<p>Hypericum &amp; Depression</p> 
<p>Medical studies demonstrate that often a natural herb &ldquo;Hypericum 
perforatum&rdquo; is as effective in treating depression as prescription 
antidepressants. Hypericum is inexpensive, available without a prescription, 
and free of the side effects often associated with antidepressant medications. 
Hypericum is derived from St. John&rsquo;s Wort (wort means 
&ldquo;plant&rdquo;) and has been used for thousands of years as a medicine.</p>
<p>In Hypericum &amp; Depression, two noted psychiatrists report on research 
that could change the way depression is treated in America explaining what 
depression is, how to know if one is depressed, the medical effects of 
hypericum on depression, and where to find research-grade hypericum (noting 
that not all hypericum supplements are alike). Hypericum &amp; Depression is 
enhanced with summaries of selected medical studies on the effect of hypericum 
upon a state of depression. Hypericum &amp; Depression is &ldquo;must&rdquo; 
reading for anyone with an interest in alternative medicine and/or who suffers 
from chronic depression.</p> 
<p>Hypericum is a herb that has been used for thousands of years as a 
medicine. Hypericum &amp; Depression is a report of recent medical research 
with tremendous implications for the treatment of depression. In a simple, 
straightforward style suitable for the interested non-specialist general 
reader, Hypericum &amp; Depression explains what depression is, how to know if 
one is depressed, the medical effects of hypericum on depression, . .</p>

<p>There are several natural ways to treat joint pain without using 
prescription and non-prescription medications that cause side effects. Several 
recent studies recommend the natural ingredients in one advanced joint pain 
formula as one of the natural ways to treat joint pain.</p>

<p>Thanks for nice post. We can say that Ayurveda, like other so-called 
&ldquo;alternative medicine&rdquo; can help to combat any disease. Ayurveda as 
well as other ancient therapies (both oriental and western) are exactly 
traditional, and they are tested and verified over many generations. Twentieth 
century brought us the &ldquo;marvelous&rdquo; invention of &ldquo;fast 
food&rdquo; and pharmacological chemicals that relieve a little of the harm 
which causes unhealthy eating (who knows what is more harmful?). Among the 
worst is that the twentieth century poisoned our consciousness and we have not 
known what is real and what&rsquo;s not. I believe that the twenty-first 
century will return the traditional way of life and a far more discerning look 
at yourself.</p>

<p>Ayurvedic remedies are great nor only for skin problems, but to cleanse 
your body from all the unhealthy food we eat. Actually the women in my family 
prefer natural remedies than pills or drugs when they have pms or during 
menopause</p>

<p>Thanks for post! Ayurvedic remedies are really the way to go especially for 
minor needs that are not life threatening. Basically, it takes the natural 
plant matter that is used in making prescriptions and uses the plant directly. 
It works well and has no added chemicals.</p> 
<p>Thanks so much for the book recommendations, always looking for more health

<p>It&rsquo;s a simple fact: drugs are a multi-billion dollar business. Not 
only do drug companies have politicians in their pocket, but they also invest 
huge sums of money on advertising.Many drug companies actually spend much more 
on marketing than they do on actually researching and developing the drugs they 
sell.</p>

<p>I work with herbs and use a lot of herbal remedies myself, however I 
haven&rsquo;t really looked into the Ayurvedic side of it. Your article 
definitely piqued my interest and am going to look into it further. Just a 
slight cautionary note to anyone thinking about using herbal remedies; be sure 
to do your research before you take any herb, especially if you are taking any 
prescription medications. Just because it&rsquo;s &lsquo;natural&rsquo; 
doesn&rsquo;t mean it can&rsquo;t harm you. Do your homework and consult your 
doctor first.</p>

<p>Ayurveda is about establishing balance in the human body through physical, 
mental, and spiritual wellbeing, which can be attained by maintaining a healthy 
lifestyle, diet, body cleansing, and exercise. It is Indian traditional 
medicine, which began more than 5,000 years ago. In the Western World, Ayurveda 
is considered an alternative medicine that aims to prevent and treat health 
problems.</p>

<p>Hi, </p> 
<p>Thank you for sharing this article on alternative remedies for common 
ailments. Ayurvedic remedies are a natural way to relieve symptoms without 
having to rely on drugs. Alternative based remedies have both long term and 
short term benefits on people&rsquo;s health. Here is an article that talks 
about the pros and cons of natural medicines:

 I hope this helps your readers understand the significance of natural based 
remedies as opposed to drugs.</p>
