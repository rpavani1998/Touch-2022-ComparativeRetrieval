<p><strong>The TianZi Orchid Tea</strong></p> 
<p>these flowers are from the medicinal orchid species Dendrobium chrysotoxum. 
Their fragrance resembles honey in order to attract bees; however, there is no 
honey. But the honey aroma gives the usually a bit bitter freshly harvested tea 
a very mild taste and great fragrance. Also perfect for diabetic people who 
wish to avoid honey but like its taste.</p> 
<p>You can mix the tea flowers with any other loose tea or use them pure as a 
very exclusive special tea.</p> <br>

the best tea 
of Xishuangbanna is from the Bulang Mountains. For blending with orchid 
flowers, we have chosen the 2007 mature leaves. Their mature aroma blends 
wonderfully with the honey scent of the orchid flowers. A truly unique product
