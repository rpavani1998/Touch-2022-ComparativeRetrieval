<p><b>A Review of Dr. Constance McCorkle's Chapter 41: &quot;Ethnoveterinary 
Medicine&quot;</b> </p>
<p>by Robert Imrie, DVM <br>
&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp; </p>
<p>Dr. Constance McCorkle begins her chapter on &quot;Ethnoveterinary 
medicine&quot; by telling us that Ethnoveterinary Research, Development and 
Extension (ERD&amp;E), has emerged as a &quot;fertile field&quot; that promises 
to benefit &quot;rural and peri-urban stockraisers&quot; not just in the Third 
World, but everywhere, by virtue of the &quot;generation (or 
regeneration)&quot; of certain &quot;animal health technologies&quot;</p>
<p>She and her colleagues define Ethnoveterinary Research, Development and 
Extension as:</p> 
<blockquote> Pg. 713: The holistic, interdisciplinary study of local knowledge 
and its associated skills, practices, beliefs, practitioners, and the social 
structures pertaining to the healthcare and healthful husbandry of food-, 
work-, and other income-producing animals, always with an eye to practical 
development applications within livestock production and livelihood systems and 
with the ultimate goal of increasing human well-being via increased benefits 
from stock raising. </blockquote> As we'll see, in the context of ERD&amp;E, 
the term &quot;research&quot; refers not to the critical scientific 
investigation of traditional or folk medical practices, but to their 
&quot;judgment-free&quot; investigation and &quot;validation&quot; in 
accordance with the tenets of cultural anthropology. And notwithstanding the 
&quot;veterinary&quot; in &quot;ethnoveterinary medicine,&quot; few if any 
veterinarians seem to be active participants in the ERD&amp;E 
&quot;movement.&quot; Likewise, while many participants apparently hold Ph.Ds 
in various &quot;liberal arts&quot; and &quot;social studies&quot; disciplines, 
very few of them seem to be scientists. Moreover, it's quite clear that the 
ERD&amp;E movement has at least as much to do with the &quot;extension&quot; 
(promotion) of a philosophical, social, and even political agenda as it does 
with helping &quot;stockraisers&quot; make a living.
<p>To her great credit, Dr. McCorkle is perhaps the only contributor to Schoen 
and Wynn's &quot;alt-vet-med&quot; opus to employ a fully rational definition 
of &quot;holistic&quot; and/or &quot;holism.&quot; This is no mean distinction. 
While other contributing authors have chosen, for instance, to ignore the fact 
that &quot;holistic&quot; traditional Chinese medicine is oblivious to the 
existence of the nervous, the endocrine, and circulatory systems, or the fact 
that &quot;holistic&quot; homeopathy ignores both the &quot;germ theory of 
disease&quot; and modern physics, Dr. McCorkle's definition deals only with 
&quot;brass-tacks factual&quot; considerations. Bravo!</p>
<p>Despite my serious misgivings regarding what seem to be Dr. McCorkle's 
&quot;strategic&quot; social and political objectives, I am very much in favor 
of at least some of her &quot;tactical&quot; objectives with regard to pastoral 
and primitive agricultural societies. For instance, when cost or lack of 
availability preclude the use of more safe and effective modern 
pharmaceuticals, it makes sense to exploit herbal or traditional therapeutic 
agents likely to be safe and at least marginally effective. And who would deny 
the self-evident fact that the observations of pastoralists, herbalists, and 
folk medicine practitioners sometimes &quot;point a finger&quot; leading to the 
discovery and development of new husbandry techniques, pharmaceuticals and 
healthcare technologies? Certainly it would be shortsighted to suggest that the 
observations and ideas of witchdoctors, shamans and other traditional healers 
should be &quot;dismissed out-of-hand.&quot; The very suggestion is 
antithetical to both the spirit and the principles of genuine scientific 
investigation. (And that's precisely why I suspect this message stems from the 
&quot;cultural anthropology community&quot; rather than &quot;scientific 
community.&quot;)</p>
<p>In any case, I'm certain that advocates of scientific biomedicine share my 
conviction that various &quot;traditional medical systems&quot; merit rigorous 
but open-minded scientific evaluation. Who can say what treasures these 
resources might yield? I suspect that conventional &quot;Western&quot; and even 
&quot;Third World&quot; veterinarians share Dr. McCorkle's and my eagerness to 
&quot;integrate what works in folk medicine&quot; with &quot;what works in 
scientific biomedicine.&quot; Where we differ seems to be in how we propose to 
determine &quot;what works and what doesn't.&quot;</p>
<p>In reviewing Dr. McCorkle's twenty-nine-page-long chapter, I will endeavor 
to move from the specific to the general. That is, I'll first examine and 
comment on specific statements, examples and claims she raises and then 
consider the broader sociological, political, and philosophical implications of 
her work.</p>
<p>While Dr. McCorkle and ERD&amp;E-advocate colleagues are clearly very keen 
on &quot;studying&quot; traditional veterinary practices and veterinary folk 
medicine, only once in the course of her chapter does she mention, in passing, 
the need to &quot;discriminate&quot; between effective and ineffective 
therapies:</p> 
<blockquote> Pg. 734: For local knowledge to be broadly and responsibly put to 
use, some means of discriminating between effective and ineffective methods is 
required. </blockquote> The average veterinarian might read this and assume 
that Dr. McCorkle is surely going to suggest the obvious: that carefully 
designed scientific studies and field work are called for. After all, 
distinguishing between what works and what doesn't is the single thing science 
does best, isn't it? Not in the realm of ethnoveterinary medicine. Instead, 
cultural anthropologist McCorkle tells us:
<blockquote> Pg. 734: The problem in accurately evaluating packages of 
ethnoveterinary (or conventional) IDM [integrated disease-management] is one of 
Western scientific reductionism. </blockquote> And. 
<blockquote> Pg. 734: The flaws of conventional science make [.] the need to 
scientifically validate local knowledge and practice controversial. 
</blockquote> For the benefit of non-cultural-anthropologists, 
&quot;reductionism&quot; is the intellectual tool by which scientists attempt 
to understand complex phenomena and things by &quot;reducing&quot; them to 
their constituent parts and underlying principles. In other words, it's a means 
of &quot;taking the universe apart to see how it works.&quot; The technique has 
been wildly successful, as the development of high technology in the West 
attests. While reductionism is merely one among many tools employed by science, 
cultural constructivists and various other non-scientist critics of science 
claim that &quot;Western science&quot; is embodied by and limited to 
reductionism. Cultural constructivists seem to prefer broad philosophical, 
magical and metaphysical understandings of the universe which are not based on 
objective and systematic examination of constituent parts and underlying 
physical laws.
<p>On page 732, Dr. McCorkle cites five circumstances in which, she concedes, 
ethnoveterinary medicine &quot;may not be the best alternative.&quot; In each 
of these five instances, however, she is quick to point out allegedly similar 
failures in &quot;conventional&quot; veterinary medicine - lest we conclude 
that &quot;ethnoveterinary medicine&quot; and &quot;conventional veterinary 
medicine&quot; are not equally &quot;valid&quot; and effective healthcare 
delivery systems.</p>
<p>Under the tenets of ERD&amp;E, when and if &quot;ethnoveterinary science 
and knowledge&quot; fail to pass rigorous scientific muster, it doesn't mean 
they aren't &quot;valid&quot; (whatever that means.) It means that the 
scientific method is invalid. This, of course, makes &quot;ethnoveterinary 
science and knowledge&quot; a &quot;non-falsifiable belief system.&quot; Heads 
we win, tails you lose. Furthermore, while Dr. McCorkle speaks of 
&quot;validating&quot; traditional veterinary practices, she doesn't seem at 
all eager to advocate discarding such practices when they're shown to be 
ineffective, or to refine and develop those that pass scientific muster. 
Moreover, in this and other medical anthropological and cultural constructivist 
literature, what modern scientists know as &quot;science&quot; is consistently 
described as &quot;Western science&quot; or &quot;conventional science,&quot; 
and it is generally described as having &quot;failed&quot; in most &quot;Third 
World&quot; contexts. Conversely, what most scientists would construe as 
&quot;local religious or metaphysical belief systems&quot; and 
&quot;traditional or folk medicine&quot; are consistently described as 
&quot;ethnoscience&quot; and &quot;ethnomedicine.&quot;</p> 
<blockquote> Pg. 718: [Off-set box 41-2] Topics and Themes in ERD&amp;E: <br>

Ethnoveterinary Science System: 
<p>It's not immediately clear whether Dr. McCorkle and her 
ERD&amp;E-advocating colleagues are suggesting that the following entities be 
studied in a scientific manner or that they are, in and of themselves, 
&quot;sciences.&quot; I suspect the latter is the case, but it's not entirely 
obvious.</p> 
<p>Ethnoveterinary semantics and taxonomies. How people name and classify 
diseases, treatments and other health matters. </p> 
<p>The fact that what used to be merely the study of &quot;veterinary folk 
medicine&quot; has been transmogrified into the much more impressive-sounding 
&quot;Ethnoveterinary Research, Development and Extension&quot; speaks volumes 
about the proliferation of semantics and taxonomies in this field. It remains 
to be seen whether or not this new and ever-expanding jargon is a worthwhile 
invention.</p> 
<p>Ethnopathophysiology: How people understand the interrelationship, 
functions, and malfunctions of different organs and systems (e.g., circulatory, 
nervous), often garnered from practical necropsy at slaughter or ritual 
sacrifice. </p> 
<p>What about the various ways people misunderstand these things? In 
&quot;ethnoveterinary science,&quot; is it ever possible to mis-understand 
pathophysiology? At least until the 19th century, when Western anatomical 
knowledge became available, Chinese medical practitioners held that the trachea 
communicated not with the lungs, but with the abdomen. Is this an 
&quot;understanding&quot; or a &quot;misunderstanding&quot; of anatomy? Are 
there literally no &quot;wrong&quot; ideas about pathophysiology? Are all such 
ideas &quot;equally right&quot;? If not, then how does one sort the 
&quot;wrong&quot; ideas from the &quot;right&quot; ones?. or the good ideas 
from the not so good? That's precisely where genuine science excels.</p> 
<p>Is a butcher really best described as an &quot;ethnopathologist&quot; or an 
&quot;ethnoanatomist&quot;? What about a shaman or witchdoctor who diagnoses by 
means of reading the entrails of slain goats? Instead of imposing new 
self-descriptions on Third World practitioners, why don't Dr. McCorkle and her 
colleagues advocate that we simply re-define &quot;Western&quot; pathologists 
and anatomists as ethno-butchers, ethno-shamans, and ethno-witchdoctors? 
Wouldn't that be a far more egalitarian and far less neo-imperialist approach?
</p> 
<p>While it's true that science often employs elaborate and highly specialized 
jargon, it does so in the interest of precision. Some authors have suggested 
that, rather than enhancing the precision of the definitions in question, 
ethnoscientific and post-modernist jargon are really intended to advance a 
certain social philosophy and political agenda. More specifically, such a 
specialized and intentionally impenetrable language allows &quot;insiders&quot; 
to identify one another as such, and creates the impression among 
&quot;outsiders&quot; that &quot;insiders&quot; enjoy special knowledge and 
expertise, and have a deeper understanding of the pertinent issues than 
&quot;uninitiated&quot; others.</p> 
<p>For a highly revealing and absolutely hilarious insight into the 
fa&ccedil;ade of post-modernist and cultural constructivist jargon and puffery, 
I refer readers to the &quot;Sokal Affair.&quot;[1],[2] In the Fall of 1994, 
theoretical physicist Alan Sokal submitted an essay to<i>Social Text</i>, the 
leading journal in the field of &quot;cultural studies.&quot; The piece was 
titled &quot;Transgressing the Boundaries: Toward a Transformative Hermeneutics 
of Quantum Gravity,&quot; and purported to be a scholarly article about the 
&quot;postmodern&quot; philosophical and political implications of 20th century 
physics theories.[3] However, as Sokal, himself, revealed in a simultaneously 
published issue of the journal<i>Lingua Franca</i>,[4] the essay was nothing 
more than a hodge-podge of deliberate solecisms, scientific howlers, non 
sequiturs and post-modernist gobbledygook cobbled together so as to look good 
and flatter the ideological preconceptions of the editors. It passed &quot;peer 
review&quot; by five members of<i>Social Text's</i> editorial board, and was 
published as a serious piece of scholarship. It appeared in a April 1996 as 
part of a special double-issue devoted to rebutting the charge that cultural 
studies critiques of science tend to be riddled with incompetence.</p> 
<p>Generally speaking, science, social philosophies and political agendas - no 
matter how well intentioned -- have made exceedingly poor bedfellows. Consider 
such examples as Social Darwinism, Creation Science, Fascist Eugenics, and 
Lysenkoism, among others.</p> </blockquote> 
<blockquote> Ethnoetiologic and ethnoepidemiologic theories: The causes 
(supernatural as well as natural) that people assign to different diseases and 
their understandings about disease transmission (including zoonoses). 
</blockquote> 
<blockquote> Again, what about the ways people mis-understand disease 
transmission and cause? Aren't mis-understandings as important as 
understanding? If, as is apparently the case in some parts of sub-Saharan 
Africa, people believe that men can cure themselves of AIDS or HIV infection by 
having sex with a virgin, does that constitute an &quot;understanding&quot; of 
HIV epidemiology/etiology/ pathophysiology, or a &quot;mis-understanding&quot; 
of same? In any case, if a &quot;theory&quot; or &quot;intellectual 
system&quot; assumes the reality of magic or supernatural forces, no matter 
what you call it, it isn't &quot;science.&quot;
<p>Ethnodiagnostic knowledge and technique: Based on all the above factors, 
plus clinical observation of signs and syndromes, how people decide what the 
given health care problem is and thus how to treat or control it. </p> 
<p>Believe it or not, under the tenets of ethnomedicine, &quot;possession by 
demons&quot; or &quot;an excess of abdominal foam&quot; are both perfectly 
acceptable &quot;ethnoscientific&quot; diagnoses for what ethno-scientifically 
unsavvy &quot;Western&quot; healthcare professionals might identify as a case 
of idiopathic epilepsy. If one understands that seizures are due to paroxysms 
of neuronal discharge, it leads one to look for ways to stabilize neuronal 
physiology. If one believes that seizures are caused by &quot;an excess of 
abdominal foam&quot; (as do traditional healers in Cameroon),[5] it leads one 
to attempt to stop or reduce &quot;foam secretion.&quot; Are both approaches 
equally likely to lead to seizure control?</p> 
<p>Is it possible for any diagnosis, other than perhaps &quot;Western&quot; 
scientific ones, to be wrong under the rubric of &quot;ethnomedical 
science&quot;? It's hard to imagine how anything could be construed as a 
misdiagnosis under such a system. But, if all diagnoses are 
&quot;correct,&quot; and one is no more or less accurate than another, what 
good does it do to come up with a diagnosis at all? Do all diagnoses reflect an 
equally valid understanding of a disease process? If they did, wouldn't it 
follow that all traditional interventions should not only &quot;work,&quot; but 
work just as well as &quot;Western&quot; (scientific biomedical) interventions. 
I submit that they rarely if ever work as well as scientific biomedical 
interventions, at least on a &quot;level playing field.&quot; Like it or not, 
all things being equal, dressings made of cow feces simply don't work as well 
on an open wound as antibiotics and sterile dressings do. (See below.)</p> 
<p>Pg. 720: [Off-set box 41-3] Topics and Themes in ERD&amp;E </p> 
<p>Local knowledge should not be dismissed out of hand just because it is 
sometimes couched in seemingly nonscientific or supernatural idiom; it should 
always be investigated further.</p> </blockquote> 
<p><br>
Seemingly nonscientific? The first couple of times I read this 
passage, I assumed that the author merely meant that the idiom sometimes is 
unscientific or supernatural. I no longer think this is the case. The author is 
clearly committed to the &quot;ethnoscientific tenet&quot; that any local 
belief, no matter how irrational or steeped in the supernatural, is really a 
&quot;scientific concept.&quot; Of course, from a scientific or even merely a 
rationalist perspective, this is nonsense.</p>
<p>On the other hand, while they might be obliged to reject local as well as 
&quot;Western&quot; notions of supernatural or metaphysical etiology, I don't 
think any good scientist is likely to dismiss out-of-hand the observations that 
have led folk medicine practitioners to do what they do. (If some 
flesh-and-blood scientists in the field have dismissed such observation out of 
hand, it says a lot about their failings as scientists and very little about 
the shortcomings of science.) Local observation and local notions of 
metaphysical etiology are entirely separate issues, but the distinction is one 
that Dr. McCorkle seems to either overlook or not to understand. Paying 
attention to and investigating the observations of non-scientists has, 
historically, played a major part in the development of modern science and 
technology. Uncritically &quot;buying into&quot; or accepting the metaphysics 
of those making such observations has not. What many non-scientists fail to 
appreciate is that such informal long-term observation often provides a key 
impetus and essential starting point for genuine scientific investigation. For 
instance, pre-scientific experience with selective breeding of domestic animals 
played a major part in the development of modern genetics. What the 
&quot;ethnoscience advocates&quot; apparently refuse to accept is that informal 
observation and trial-and-error findings do not, in and of themselves, 
constitute a &quot;science&quot; - least of all when they are mixed with a 
hodge-podge of local magical and religious beliefs. To the contrary, rather 
than viewing these casual findings and local beliefs as a starting-point for 
genuine scientific investigation, they attempt to construe them as the 
end-product of a scientific process. That process, they assert, is 
&quot;ethnoscience.&quot;</p> 
<blockquote> Pg. 725: [Off-set box 41-10] Traditional vs. Modern Pharmacology: 
In 1994 a set of on-station trials was mounted in Indonesia to validate local 
Javanese treatment for ovine endoparasitism, with the goal of making a 
commercial version for the market. The traditional treatment consists merely of 
periodically feeding the sheep whole, immature papaya fruits. On the basis of 
prior experiments and review of the pharmacologic literature, scientists knew 
the key parasitacidal constituent resided mainly in the fruit sap. Therefore 
they collected and administered only the sap, instead of following the farmer's 
practice of feeding the whole fruit. In a matter of hours, 80% of the sheep in 
the high-dosage experiment group and 20% in the medium-dosage group died of 
acute poisoning. (Anonymous, 1994). </blockquote> It's not clear what Dr. 
McCorkle thinks this anecdote illustrates. Is the administration of 
&quot;sap&quot; or a crude plant extract really a manifestation of &quot;modern 
pharmacology&quot;? And where is the evidence for efficacy of the traditional 
treatment in the first place? Also, why is this account &quot;anonymous&quot;? 
Are there really so many Indonesian firms and institutions conducting 
phytopharmacological investigation that this story couldn't be tracked down? 
Surely there must be a record of participation by these &quot;scientists.&quot;
<p>On page 735, Dr. McCorkle cites this anonymous anecdote as an example of a 
&quot;costly&quot; and &quot;embarrassing error&quot; which might have been 
prevented had the &quot;scientists&quot; involved heeded the advice of local 
stockraisers (or, presumably, other types of &quot;ethnoscientists&quot;). Upon 
careful reading of the above passage, one notices that the mortality rate in 
the &quot;low-dosage&quot; group is not mentioned. Might it have been 0%? Dr. 
McCorkle seems to have overlooked the fact that this endeavor was intended to 
be an experiment. In real science, experimental results don't always conform to 
the experimenter's expectations. Did the &quot;scientists&quot; conducting this 
experiment view it as a failure? Were they eventually able to standardize the 
product and determine a relatively safe and effective dose? Did such a product 
ever reach the market? Might not the sap of the papaya or a crude extract be 
more stable and therefore more practical and economical for local stockraisers 
to use than the highly perishable whole plant? Unfortunately, since no author 
or source is cited for this anecdote, we'll probably never know the answers to 
these questions.</p> 
<blockquote> Pg. 732: Finally, because people are usually more familiar with 
indigenous medicines, they may be less likely to misuse or abuse these 
preparations than with alien Western drugs. </blockquote> Well, fine: I'm sure 
people do tend to &quot;misuse and abuse&quot; drugs they're not familiar with, 
but that has always been a problem whenever and wherever new drugs have been 
introduced - including in the West. I can't help but see a bit of condescending 
ethnocentrism in Dr. McCorkle's views on such matters. Veterinarians and 
stockraisers in the West have had more than a few problems in learning how to 
properly employ (or not employ) various newly introduced drugs and technologies 
over the last 60 years. (In fact, they are still struggling with such issues as 
how best to employ - or not employ - antibiotics in livestock husbandry.)
<p>So far as I'm aware, ethnoveterinary science advocates are not lobbying 
Western farmers and stockraisers to forgo modern science and technology in 
favor of 19th and 18th century alternatives. Why not?</p>
<p>If Dr. McCorkle could travel back to the 1940s, would she be lobbying 
against the introduction in the West of antibiotics or petrochemical 
fertilizers and advocating that farmers, veterinarians and physicians cling to 
the &quot;tried and true old ways&quot;? If not, why not? If so, sixty years 
down the road would we really be better off for having persisted in using the 
&quot;more familiar&quot; old ways of treating and preventing disease or 
conducting agriculture? Certainly, we would now be dealing with only a very few 
antibiotic resistant strains, but what good would that do us? We wouldn't be 
using &quot;new-fangled&quot; antibiotics anyway, so &quot;resistance&quot; 
would be a &quot;non-problem.&quot; And, in the meantime, how many millions of 
animals and people would have died from simple bacterial infections? If, in the 
1930s and 40s, we in the West had chosen to eschew chemical fertilizers, we 
certainly would not be dealing with the nitrate runoff problems we currently 
face. On the other hand, we would almost certainly have far more serious 
problems to contend with such as nationwide famine and almost universal 
poverty, since industrial agriculture would be impossible. In fact, most of us 
would be engaged in subsistence farming, absorbed from sun-up to sun-down, 
seven days a week, in backbreaking manual labor, and hoping desperately to 
avoid starvation and survive the next epidemic of vaccine-preventable human and 
livestock disease. Of course, we don't have to wonder whether or not things 
really would have turned out that way. All we have to do is look at present day 
&quot;ethnomedicine-&quot; and &quot;ethnoscience-dependent&quot; societies of 
which Dr. McCorkle speaks. The description seems to fit them pretty well.</p>
<p>When unfamiliar drugs and technologies have been introduced in the West, 
education rather than abstinence has generally proven to be the most rewarding 
approach. It would seem, at best, patronizing for Western &quot;ethnomedicine 
advocates&quot; to suggest that &quot;Third World stockraisers&quot; might be 
any less capable of learning how to effectively cope with such introductions 
than their Western antecedents.</p> 
<blockquote> Pg. 732: Effective ethnopharmaceuticals may pose fewer dangers 
than do the more highly residual, poisonous, concentrated, and unfamiliar drugs 
and agrochemicals of the First World. Humans, livestock, local fauna, and the 
environment stand to benefit from ethnomedical alternatives. </blockquote> The 
key term here is &quot;may.&quot; This seems a classic case of assuming one's 
conclusions in one's preamble. We won't know which, if any, &quot;ethnomedical 
alternatives&quot; are safe, effective, environmentally friendly and 
economically sound until we scientifically investigate them one at a time. Dr. 
McCorkle may be unaware of the fact that while natural and sythetic toxins 
actually present similar inherent risks, animal and human exposure to natural 
toxins is much higher than to synthetic ones.[6],[7] 
<p>Also, it's inaccurate and disingenuous to characterize all &quot;'First 
World' drugs and agrochemicals&quot; as &quot;highly residual and 
poisonous.&quot; The fact is that many non-residual rapidly and spontaneously 
self-degrading pesticides have been developed and marketed in recent decades - 
as a direct result of just the concerns Dr. McCorkle cites. Likewise, chemical 
fertilizers may be more expensive than livestock manure, but they are vastly 
more effective on a per-unit-of-weight basis and much less likely to result in 
the transmission of salmonella, E. coli, and other pathogens to human or animal 
consumers.</p> 
<blockquote> Pg. 732: [Off-set box 41-16] Medicoreligious Beliefs and 
Practices: Quechua Indians' ethnoetiology of contagious keratoconjuctivitis in 
sheep is expressed partly in sixteenth-century Iberian notions of hot and cold 
diseases and partly in Incaic concepts of evil winds. Their ethnodiagnosis of 
the condition is nevertheless 100% accurate. [.] </blockquote> 100% accurate? 
My food-animal veterinary practitioner colleagues will, I'm sure, be fascinated 
to learn that infectious keratoconjunctivitis has nothing to do with 
Mycoplasma, Rickettsia or Chlamydia, and everything to do with &quot;hot and 
cold diseases&quot; and &quot;evil winds.&quot; &quot;Western&quot; 
veterinarians can presumably forget about controlling the vectors of the 
disease since the vector turns out to be &quot;evil wind&quot; rather than 
flies. And, since the disease isn't caused by infectious agents, neither 
Western veterinary practitioners nor Third World &quot;ethnoveterinarians&quot; 
will want to waste time or money on heretofore effective topical and cheap 
antibiotics. After all, in a rational world, the &quot;ethno-diagnosis&quot; 
and the &quot;scientific biomedical diagnosis&quot; can't be 100% different 
from each other and both be 100% accurate, right? While this is indeed the case 
in the rational world, &quot;ethnoscience&quot; not only isn't a part of the 
rational world, it denies the very existence of objective reality. In the 
ethnoscientific worldview, there are no objective facts or realities, only 
local &quot;cultural constructs&quot; of same.
<p>The Quechua &quot;ethnodiagnosis&quot; for infectious keratoconjunctivitis 
is perhaps correct, if one defines correct as identifying that there is a 
problem in the eye of the sheep. In such a fashion, regularly identifying that 
a person had epilepsy, but attributing the cause to possession by the devil, 
would most likely be a proper &quot;ethnodiagnosis.&quot; The problem is that, 
in the real world, such a diagnosis doesn't help - at least not when one is 
hoping to deliver effective health care. Merely recognizing that a condition 
exists, and being able to recognize it regularly, isn't really the problem. 
It's understanding why the condition exists and knowing what to do about it 
that really counts. While it's possible that &quot;traditional healers&quot; 
may occasionally, in their efforts to eliminate &quot;heat&quot; or 
&quot;cold,&quot; or foil demons or &quot;evil winds,&quot; may stumble upon 
therapeutic interventions that actually help, the process is haphazard at best. 
If one hopes to systematically investigate illnesses and efficiently develop 
effective therapies, there simply is no substitute for an accurate, 
science-based understanding of anatomy, physiology, and the etiology of 
disease. Other &quot;ways of knowing&quot; and &quot;means of investigating the 
Universe&quot; have, without exception, repeatedly proven to be horribly 
inefficient and inconsistent in this regard. Dressing up folk medicine as 
&quot;ethnomedicine,&quot; and shamans as &quot;ethnoscientists,&quot; then 
equating them with scientific biomedicine and scientists merely obfuscates 
these facts by means of insipid jargon.</p>
<p>It's curious to note that, in the previous passage, Dr. McCorkle refers to 
&quot;Iberian notions&quot; of hot and cold disease and &quot;Incaic 
concepts&quot; of evil winds. [For those non-ethno-anthropologists out there, 
Iberian means Spanish and Incaic means &quot;of the Incas.&quot;] The Western 
idea is a &quot;notion&quot; while the Amerindian idea is a 
&quot;concept.&quot; Do these terms denote and connote precisely the same 
things?</p>
<p>Here is report from the medical literature which casts the practices of Dr. 
McCorkle's Quechua &quot;ethnoscientists&quot; and &quot;ethnomedical 
practitioners&quot; in a somewhat different light:[8] </p> 
<blockquote> The data suggest a pattern of discrimination against females and 
younger children, especially infants under age one, despite the fact that these 
groups were reported to be sicker. Differences were especially significant in 
the allocation of biomedical treatments, the most costly in terms of parental 
time, effort, and money. Ethnographic data on child illness, gender, and 
developmental concepts help to explain why children of different genders and 
ages may be treated differently in the rural Andes. They provide a context in 
which to interpret health care allocation data, and, in the absence of a 
population-based study, reinforce findings based on the limited study sample. 
Female children are valued less because of their future social and economic 
potential. Females are also regarded to be less vulnerable to illness than male 
children, meaning that less elaborate measures are necessary to protect their 
health. Young children are thought to have a loose body-soul connection, making 
them more vulnerable to illness, and are though to be less human than older 
individuals. The folk illnesses urana (fright) and larpa explain child deaths 
in culturally acceptable ways, and the types of funerals given to children of 
different ages indicate that the death of young children is not considered 
unusual. Health care allocation and ethnographic data suggest that selective 
neglect (passive infanticide) may be occurring in rural Peru, possibly as a 
means of regulating family size and sex ratio. It is important to go beyond 
placing blame on individual parents or on culture, however, to address the 
underlying causes of differential health care allocation, such as poor 
socioeconomic conditions, lack of access to contraceptives, and female 
subordination. </blockquote> Of course, the author of this paper was 
undoubtedly &quot;biased&quot; in favor of &quot;Western&quot; science and 
against &quot;ethnoscience.&quot; I'm sure that ethnoscience advocates would be 
aghast at the Western ethnocentric notion that the time time-tested 
ethnoscientific techniques of female infanticide and female subordination and 
ethnoscientific knowledge regarding disease vulnerability of female children 
should be thrown out in favor of contraception, increased access to Western 
medicine, and Western notions of sexual egalitarianism. After all, these 
methods have &quot;worked&quot; for Peruvians for countless generations. That's 
a tough break for the little kids, and especially the little girls in Peru, who 
have to die as a result.
<blockquote> Pgs. 731-2: Cautionary Lessons [.] All around the globe, whether 
for human or livestock ailments, urine is commonly used as a disinfectant for 
cuts and abrasions, and mud or animal feces as a dressing for wounds and 
bruises. All these materials can (and do) work as intended, but they also pose 
risks of secondary infection. Sometimes, however, ethnomedical beliefs are 
actually harmful [.] </blockquote> Suddenly, instead of ethnoscientific 
knowledge, we're talking about &quot;ethnomedical belief.&quot; How are we to 
tell one from the other when the standard of proof (i.e., standard of evidence) 
is &quot;if its been around for a long time and the locals believe it works, it 
does&quot;?
<p>Fortunately, there is apparently no need to subject urine therapy and mud 
or fecal dressings to Randomized Controlled Trials: Dr. McCorkle assures us 
that these therapeutic interventions &quot;can and do work.&quot; And she 
apparently dismisses the idea that healing may occur in spite of the treatments 
offered. Unfortunately, she doesn't tell us what the &quot;ethnomedically 
correct&quot; response might be when a skeptical &quot;Western&quot; medical 
practitioner's &quot;ethnomedical practitioner-colleague&quot; suggests 
treating a lacerated patient with a cow-feces dressing. I suspect that 
&quot;over my dead body, you quack&quot; would be construed as demonstration of 
&quot;hegemonic, imperialist, oppressive, close-minded, and ethnophobic&quot; 
disrespect toward a &quot;fellow health professional.&quot; I also suspect that 
attempting to make them aware of the &quot;Germ Theory of Infection&quot; would 
be construed as blatant ethnocentric imperialist indoctrination. Perhaps it 
would be more &quot;ethnomedically correct&quot; to suggest a poultice 
comprised of 50% cow feces and 50% antibiotic ointment.</p> 
<blockquote> Pg. 734: Ethnomedicine itself provides an excellent example of 
such processes [the integration of &quot;conventional&quot; science and 
&quot;ethno&quot; science]. It gave the world invaluable drugs such as aspirin, 
codeine, curare, and quinine [.] </blockquote> Well, not exactly. The facts are 
as follows: &quot;Ethnomedicine&quot; gave us not aspirin, which is 
acetylsalicylic acid, but the bitter glycoside salicin in the form of willow 
bark. Salicin works reasonably well as an antipyretic, but is extremely rough 
on the GI system - much more so than aspirin. Chemists discovered aspirin in 
1899, learning to synthesize it from coal tar. Aspirin and other synthetic 
salicylates soon completely displaced compounds obtained from natural sources. 
&quot;Ethnomedicine&quot; gave us opium - a mixture of at least 20 alkaloids, 
not codeine. Codeine, which is morphine-3-methyl ether, was synthesized from 
opium by modern chemists. &quot;Ethnoscientists&quot; gave us arrows poisoned 
by extract from various plant species. Modern science isolated d-tubocurarine 
from such an extract in the early 1930s and subsequently found it to be useful 
as a muscle relaxant during surgery. &quot;Ethnobotanists&quot; gave us quinine 
in the form of cinchona bark and bark extract. Quinine is only one of many 
alkaloids in cinchona bark. In 1820, chemists were responsible for isolating 
and purifying it into a therapeutic agent safer and more effective than 
unprocessed bark or crude extract. Modern synthetic antimalarial drugs, 
however, are less toxic and more effective than quinine, and have largely 
replaced it.
<p>I would be the first to concede that these are examples of non-scientist, 
informal observers providing science and scientists with invaluable 
information, but that is not what Dr. McCorkle and her colleagues are claiming. 
They assert that these are examples of a collaboration between just two of many 
&quot;co-equal sciences,&quot; and that &quot;Western&quot; science plays no 
privileged part in the relationship and deserves no particular credit for the 
results.</p>
<p>Dr. McCorkle tells us on pages 734 and 735 that: </p> 
<blockquote> [.] scientific validation of local knowledge and practice has 
sometimes been problematic. In practice, methodological difficulties have been 
especially common in the study of botanicals [.] 
<p>[.] isolation of active ingredients should not be a precondition for the 
validation of ethnopharmaceuticals. Such research is not only costly, but 
reductionistic because traditional prescriptions are often intended to produce 
simultaneous or synergistic actions such as site-specific attack on the 
disease, enhanced immune response, increased cellular uptake, and repression of 
side effects.</p> </blockquote> This is simply fatuous rubbish. Perhaps Dr. 
McCorkle can tell us which &quot;traditional medical systems&quot; even 
conceptualized an immune system or the cellular nature of living tissue before 
these entities were discovered and articulated by &quot;Western&quot; science. 
Consider the pertinent comments of Professor of Pharmacognosy, Varro E. Tyler:[9
]
<blockquote> Many modern paraherbalists maintain that plants are not only the 
safest way to administer medicine, but also the most effective. They claim that 
apart from their active principle, plants may contain other substances that 
enhance their therapeutic action by some sort of a synergistic process. 
<p>Perhaps the most persistent advocate of this doctrine has been Andrew T. 
Weil, M.D., who argues, &quot;In the case of drug plants, the whole forms, 
being complex mixtures and therefore impure, tend to be safer than their 
unmixed derivatives, freed from diluents and made available in highly refined 
form.&quot; Weil also argues that the lesser concentration of an active 
constituent present in plant tissue renders such a drug safer to use. Finally, 
he contends that the various active constituents in a plant work 
synergistically to produce a total effect greater than the mere sum of the 
individual component activities. </p> 
<p>Weil's first two points can be dismissed simply by pointing out that 
dosage, which governs a drug's safety and efficacy, is much more readily 
controlled with purified constituents. Synergism occasionally occurs, but for 
every case where a desirable action is enhanced, there are several where 
undesirable actions are produced. For example, cinchona bark contains some 25 
closely related alkaloids, but the only one recognized as useful in the 
treatment of malaria is quinine. A person who took powdered cinchona bark would 
also ingest the alkaloid quinidine, a cardiac depressant, and cinchotannic 
acid, which would induce constipation.</p> </blockquote> On page 736, Dr. 
McCorkle tells us:
<blockquote> Finally, investments in the study and application of useful local 
knowledge, practice and social organization can produce another important 
benefit: renewed respect for local cultures and technologic knowledge. As a 
corollary, formal-sector health care workers, extensionists, educators, 
scientists, and policymakers may also gain increased appreciation of the 
knowledge and experience that their clients, students, users and citizens 
already possess. All these benefits can add up to a fresh sense of local 
confidence and control, stronger social structures, and<b>empowerment</b> of 
people to work together at the local level - whether independently or with<b>
nonhegemonic</b> formal-sector support - to solve more of their own development 
problems. </blockquote> Nonhegemonic formal-sector support? Who or what do you 
suppose Dr. McCorkle could be talking about here? Could this possibly be a 
reference to the &quot;androcentric, ethnocentric, oppressive, imperialist, 
'Western,' conventional, scientific establishment&quot; boogeyman that cultural 
constructivists and post-modernists love to hate? Words such as 
&quot;nonhegemonic,&quot; &quot;reductionist,&quot; &quot;conventional 
science,&quot; &quot;Western science,&quot; and cultural 
&quot;empowerment,&quot; are all taken directly from the &quot;cultural 
constructivist, post-modernist lexicon.&quot; (And, by the way, they vividly 
illustrate the fact that the &quot;value-free, judgment-free&quot; ethic of 
cultural relativism does<i>not</i> extend to Western European culture.) If Dr. 
McCorkle is merely saying that everyone should work together for the common 
good: fine. I couldn't agree more whole-heartedly. However, the 
&quot;nonhegemonic&quot; word is a bit disingenuous. Throughout her writings, 
Dr. McCorkle seems to assume an equality between &quot;local&quot; and 
&quot;formal&quot; practices. Such an assumption is certainly<i>not</i> 
justified if one practice is demonstrably superior to another. In such 
instances, advocating the superior (more effective and productive) practice 
does not constitute hegemony.
<p>Apparently, people solving their own local development problems is 
ethno-politically OK, but only so long as they don't resort to 
&quot;hegemonic&quot; governmental or &quot;Western&quot; institutions - i.e., 
those institutions that depend upon real science, with its objective reality, 
absolute truths, and concrete facts. Why should Third World citizens care how 
or even who solves their development problems, so long as the problems get 
solved and the solutions are satisfactory to them? What if science-based 
medicine and animal husbandry fit this bill better than ethnomedicine and 
ethnoscience?</p> 
<blockquote> None of this is to say that <b>ethnoscience</b> is perfect or that
<b>conventional science</b> must be abandoned. Rather, each has much to learn 
from the other. As Last (1990) observes for medical systems cross-culturally, 
&quot;In theory. all systems may 'work'; in practice, all have successes and 
failures, with some systems scoring much higher in particular areas of 
medicine, depending on the social, cultural, and economic context in which they 
are applied, as well as on their biomedical bases. </blockquote> This 
&quot;'ethnoscience' vs. 'conventional science' dilemma&quot; is a false one. 
In precisely which areas of medicine do non-scientific or traditional systems 
score higher than scientific biomedicine? (And citing examples where scientific 
biomedicine is incompetently applied or unavailable doesn't count.) Nowhere in 
her chapter does Dr. McCorkle suggest or even discuss the problem of getting 
shamans, witchdoctors, or other varieties of &quot;ethnoveterinary 
scientists&quot; to abandon ineffective or unsafe practices. Why not?
<p>In most &quot;non-Western&quot; cultures, traditional or folk medicine is 
an integral part of the local religion and magical/metaphysical belief systems. 
If that's the case, then doesn't Dr. McCorkle's defining folk medicine as 
&quot;ethnoscience&quot; mean that, in her view, science, religion and magic 
are inextricably interwoven? This definition undoubtedly appeals to some 
sociologists and cultural anthropologists, but most scientists will recognize 
it as nonsense. As the late Carl Sagan once said: &quot;there is no place for 
magic in science.&quot; Likewise, the notion of the &quot;supernatural&quot; is 
antithetical to true science (as distinct from pseudoscience). Real science 
works on the &quot;assumption of naturalism&quot;: i.e., that the universe 
makes sense, functions free of magical or incomprehensible influences from 
outside itself, and is at least potentially understandable. Which varieties of 
folk medicine live up to this definition?</p> 
<blockquote> Pg. 730: According to WHO [the World Health Organization], all 
appropriate human resources must be tapped if basic health services are to 
reach most of the worlds' humans; clearly the same can be recommended for the 
livestock sector. As many experts have observed, the Western model for delivery 
of animal health services has rarely worked well in developing countries. 
</blockquote> Of course, no medical delivery system has worked very well in 
developing countries. If traditional systems had worked well in the West, there 
would have been no incentive or need to develop scientific biomedicine in the 
first place. The more important issue is whether or not traditional and folk 
medical &quot;models for delivery&quot; have worked better than science-based 
ones.
<p>Alexander Macdonald offers an interesting insight into &quot;Western&quot; 
(scientific) versus &quot;traditional&quot; models of medical delivery from the 
fountainhead of &quot;ethnomedicine,&quot; China: [10] </p> 
<blockquote> [.] 60,000 people died in Manchuria of a plague between 1910 and 
1911. Eighty traditional physicians were specifically selected to control the 
plague. They all died of it themselves. The only person who was able to help 
was a young Cambridge-trained doctor, Wu Lien-te, who used his scientific 
knowledge to direct the sanitary and public health measures required to prevent 
the plague from spreading further. </blockquote> In 1998, the Washington Post 
carried an article about China's parasitism problem.[11] Apparently 70% of 
rural Chinese are parasitized, primarily by various species of worms, resulting 
in malnutrition, decreased intelligence and general weakening of the work 
force. How is this possible? Isn't rural China the seat of the world's oldest 
and most extensive branch of &quot;ethnomedical science&quot;? Much of Dr. 
McCorkle's chapter deals with the alleged triumphs of &quot;ethnoveterinary 
medicine&quot; over parasitism in livestock in the Third World. While she 
concedes in passing that specific &quot;Western&quot; pharmaceutical agents may 
be somewhat more effective than herbs or crude plant extracts, she goes out of 
her way to suggest that &quot;Western science-based medicine&quot; has 
repeatedly failed to perform as well as its &quot;ethnomedical&quot; 
counterpart in dealing with such problems.
<blockquote> Pg. 737: Per capita ratios of modern versus traditional 
practitioners to patients underscores this point. For example, China has only 
one modern medical doctor for every 10,000 patients, but the tradition of 
traditional practitioners is 1:100 (Bodecker 1994a); for Ghana and Swaziland, 
these figures are respectively 1:20,000 versus 1:200 and 1:10,000 versus 1:100 
(Zhang, 1994). Similar magnitudes can be assumed to hold for the livestock 
sector in most of the Third World. Kenyan farming communities, for example, 
typically boast two or three traditional healers for livestock but no 
formally-trained veterinary workers. </blockquote> Per capita ratios underscore 
what point? That where no formally-trained veterinarians exist, somebody is 
going to move in to try to &quot;help.&quot; This is not much of a revelation.
<blockquote> Pg. 738: The Western scientific etic is really just another emic. 
</blockquote> McCorkle employs the terms &quot;etic&quot; and &quot;emic&quot; 
repeatedly throughout her chapter. In fact, the terms seem to be favored 
elements of &quot;insider jargon&quot; among cultural anthropologists. They 
certainly show up time and again in their literature. Perhaps Noah Webster can 
help here.

not. Dr. McCorkle and her colleagues seem to employ the terms &quot;emic&quot; 
and &quot;etic&quot; as synonyms for &quot;insider&quot; and 
&quot;outsider&quot; influences, respectively, but how they arrived at these 
&quot;alternative&quot; definitions is anybody's guess. In any case, when on 
page 729 and again on page 733 Dr. McCorkle refers to &quot;lacunae in 
ethnoveterinary knowledge,&quot; I'm pretty sure she means there are 
&quot;holes in ethnoveterinary knowledge&quot; (i.e., that traditional animal 
healers don't have all the answers). Presumably she felt that more readers 
would understand &quot;lacunae&quot; than would understand &quot;holes.&quot;
<blockquote> Cognitive anthropology has repeatedly demonstrated a basic 
structural similarity in the two types of knowledge. </blockquote> Which two 
types of knowledge? Scientific and which others? How many different types are 
there? And, what's the relationship between knowledge and fact? Of course, in 
the cultural constructivist universe of cognitive anthropology, one doesn't 
have to worry about facts, because there are no absolute facts - only 
&quot;relative&quot; ones. Also, it's worth noting that hummingbirds share a 
&quot;basic structural similarity&quot; with the Space Shuttle. It does not 
follow, however, that hummingbirds are spacecraft.
<blockquote> At least since the domestication of plants and animals some 
12,000 to 15,000 years ago, farmers and stockraisers have been conducting 
empirical agricultural experiments and exchanging their findings (McCorkle, 
Brandstetter, McClure, 1988). </blockquote> OK. 
<blockquote> Interestingly, the historiography of agricultural inventions and 
recommendations at international agricultural research centers reveals that 
many of these derive directly from producer knowledge and practice. 
</blockquote> OK, but so what? They pass around experiences. How might one 
determine if their experiences are actually worthwhile? Systematically test 
them? (No. That would be a reductionist and ethnocentric &quot;Western&quot; 
scientific approach.)
<blockquote> This is not the place for an exegesis on the sociology of 
knowledge or the universality of the scientific method, however. [.] 
</blockquote> What a pity. I would have loved to dissect such an 
&quot;exegesis,&quot; had Dr. McCorkle been willing to offer one.
<blockquote> [.] In short, stockraisers are mainly interested in whether a 
given intervention makes sense to them and works to their satisfaction (and 
then, of course, whether it is available, affordable, convenient, and so forth) 
- no matter what its source.&quot; </blockquote> Well, OK. The &quot;business 
of stockraisers is business.&quot; Tell us something we don't already know. The 
fact is, agricultural science has evolved and significant recommendations have 
been made for growers and &quot;stockraisers&quot; based on dispassionate 
scientific evaluation of the data. So, while there's no doubt that the 
&quot;trial and error&quot; method has resulted in some useful advances, such a 
method is terribly inefficient. Scientific testing, while perhaps 
&quot;ethnoincorrect,&quot; actually provides a means of determining what works 
and what doesn't.
<p>This leads to an interesting question. Ethnomedicine advocates insist that 
local medical practices and husbandry techniques offer great potential benefit 
to local farmers and pastoralists, and that local knowledge and expertise 
should take precedence over that stemming from &quot;outside&quot; cultures. If 
that's the case, why do we need an &quot;outside&quot; agency (based on a 
Western invention such as ERD&amp;E) to teach local people what they, 
literally, already know? As one reads ERD&amp;E literature, it becomes 
increasingly clear that the real message has little to do with instituting 
effective medical or husbandry techniques and much to do with 
&quot;validating&quot; status quo social and cultural conventions and practices 
and promoting ethnophobic anti-Western and anti-scientific sentiment in Third 
World countries.</p>
<p>At this point, I think it would be constructive to consider what scholars 
and scientists critical of the &quot;ethnoscience&quot; movement have had to 
say. The comments of Indian microbiologist, science and technology scholar, and 
science journalist Meera Nanda are particularly salient:[12] </p>
<p>Ethnoscience: Gift or Charity? </p> 
<blockquote> They say it is impolite to look a gift horse in the mouth. It is 
indeed doubly impolite if the gift was intended as a token of respect and 
solidarity. Yet it is precisely this rather delicate task of returning a 
well-intentioned gift that I have taken upon myself in this essay. [.] 
<p>The gift I want to return is the cluster of theories that forbids outsiders 
from evaluating the truth or falsity of any beliefs of other people in other 
cultures from the vantage point of what is scientifically known about the world 
and, conversely, allows the insiders to reject as ethnocentric and 
imperialistic any truth claim that does not use locally accepted metaphysical 
categories and rules of justification. These theories hold that, because modern 
&quot;Western&quot; science is but one among many ways of understanding the 
world and is embedded in its own cultural context of production as other 
knowledges are in theirs, it cannot serve as a transculturally valid source of 
knowledge. All sciences are ethnosciences, and none is more universally true 
than any other. </p> 
<p>This gift has many names, many givers, and many presumed beneficiaries. It 
is variously called<i>ethnoscience</i>, situated knowledge, anti-Northern 
Eurocentric, or<i>post-colonial</i> science - labels that derive their force 
from their parental rubric of social constructivist theories of science. Its 
most generous sponsors are the self-consciously left and often self-described 
post-modern academics of North American and European universities (and 
increasingly also from non-Western universities as well), who see any claim of 
universality of modern science as the West's ploy for &quot;disvaluing local 
concerns and knowledge and legitimating outside experts,&quot; as Sandra 
Harding put it (1994, 319). </p> 
<p>The most aggressive consumers of ethnoscience are the equally 
&quot;left&quot; post-colonial intellectuals and activists associated with 
cultural/religious and other &quot;new social movements&quot; that aim to purge 
their cultures of all alien (mostly Western) elements. These intellectuals and 
movements openly and stridently reject the calls of earlier 
modernist/anticolonial &quot;peoples science movements&quot; in favor of 
postmodernist/postcolonialist &quot;alternative science movements.&quot; 
Whereas the former sought to assimilate modern science into local settings as a 
means of cultural change and economic development, the latter see modern 
&quot;Western&quot; science as a source of all that ails non-Western societies 
and seek alternative &quot;ways of knowing&quot; grounded in their own 
civilizations. The Western and Third World critics of the universality of 
science are united in reversing the terms of respect in Sandra Harding's 
statement quoted earlier; that is, they want to value local concerns and 
knowledge and delegitimize outside experts, assuming all the while that the 
local and the outside are irreconcilable and that the knowledge of the 
&quot;outside&quot; experts - that is, modern science - is nothing more than an 
imposition on reluctant local knowers. [.] </p> 
<p>Why should anyone want to refuse such a generous gift, least of all someone 
like myself whose own native Indian culture was berated for so long by the 
British rulers as irrational, mystical, and superstitious? How can anyone urge 
ex-colonial people to refuse this poultice of relativism when they are still so 
obviously smarting from the indignities of colonialism and when they need to 
affirm their identities to resist the seductions of the fast-encroaching 
McWorld? [.] </p> 
<p>My reason for rejecting ethnoscience is this: What from the perspective of 
Western liberal givers looks like a tolerant, nonjudgmental, therapeutic 
&quot;permission to be different&quot; appears to some of us &quot;others&quot; 
as a condescending act of charity. This epistemic charity dehumanizes us by 
denying us the capacity for a reasoned modification of our beliefs in the light 
of better evidence made available by the methods of modern science. [.] </p> 
<p>By defining the very nature of rationality and truth as internal to social 
practices, social constructivists do indeed give the natives their 
&quot;permission&quot; to be different - but, then, so did apartheid. </p> 
<p>Understandably the gift givers are dismayed to have their generosity 
interpreted as charity, their ethnosciences seen as antiscience, and their 
invitation to be different read as intellectual apartheid. This is not what 
they meant at all, they assure us Third World ingrates. The thoughtful among 
them take seriously the charge of condescension and deny that respectfully 
understanding others' beliefs implies a suspension of critical judgment. Such a 
project only demands, they claim, that every society should use criteria that 
are internal to its own &quot;specific historical tradition,&quot; for the 
criticism of its own knowledge and values. But if Western knowledge must be 
used to criticize non-Western practices, they insist, the critics must 
acknowledge that Western science is not a god's eye view, but a situated, 
ethnocentric, Western view of the world (see Rentlen 1988). </p> 
<p>The gift givers thus assure us that they are not against modern science per 
se, but only against its universal pretensions. They wish science to confess 
its culture, take on an ethnic middle name (Western) and become one among many 
other ethnosciences. Thus provincialized, science is deemed acceptable for 
certain limited and purely instrumental purposes, with no claims to truth, 
worldviews, and social values. &quot;Modern 'Western' science, yes, but modern 
universal science, no!&quot; could well summarize the prevailing 
ethnoscience/postcolonial position.</p> </blockquote> &quot;Ethnomedicine 
advocates&quot; are clearly bent on abolishing such terms as &quot;folk 
medicine,&quot; &quot;traditional medicine,&quot; &quot;shaman,&quot; 
&quot;curandero&quot; or even &quot;witchdoctor&quot;? Why? Aren't these 
reasonably objective, descriptive terms? Don't most shamans, curanderos and 
witchdoctors describe themselves as shamans, curanderos and witchdoctors? Do 
they really need Stanford graduate anthropologists to &quot;redefine them&quot; 
as &quot;ethnoveterinarians,&quot; &quot;ethnophysicians,&quot; or 
&quot;ethnoscientists,&quot; while, at the same time, telling them they 
&quot;don't really want or need 'Western' medicine&quot;? Isn't this just 
another form of condescending and patronizing neo-imperialism?
<p>One of the most fundamental assumptions of ethnomedical philosophy (if not 
cultural anthropology in general) is that, even though Third World peoples seem 
overwhelmingly eager to join in the scientific revolution and enjoy the 
abundant fruits of modern science and technology, they should be &quot;spared 
the negative impact such fruits are certain to incur on their cultures.&quot; 
This &quot;cultural anthropological viewpoint&quot; seems incredibly -- and 
quite transparently - condescending and paternalistic. It is, in my view, 
post-modern Western neo-imperialism.</p>
<p>Perhaps most Maasai people want to remain &quot;simple pastoralists.&quot; 
That's fine with me, and I sincerely hope they are able to do so. I'm willing 
to assume, at least for the sake of argument, that most Quechua people, 
Australian aborigines, and most other aboriginal peoples want to maintain their 
current lifestyles. While neither bona fide scientists nor cultural 
anthropologists can &quot;command the clock to stop&quot; for anyone, I'm all 
in favor of doing whatever can be done, within reason, to help pastoral, 
hunter-gatherer and similarly low-tech cultures maintain their chosen 
lifestyles into the 21st century.</p>
<p>Ironically, a century and a half ago in the West, New Englanders routinely 
took to the sea in wooden ships to harpoon and render whales, as many 
generations had done before them. Unfortunately for all involved (except, of 
course, the whales), the world changed unexpectedly, and these traditional 
whalers had to find another means of making a living. Things were pretty dicey 
for a while, but everything turned out for the best in the end. Perhaps, if 
this &quot;cultural anthropology thing&quot; really gets going, we Westerners 
can sharpen our harpoons and &quot;get back into the business.&quot; I wonder 
what ethnoscience advocates would think of such a move. After all, the Makah 
Indians of Western Washington have recently attempted to do precisely the same 
thing. Sometimes it's neither possible, nor desirable, to maintain the cultural 
status quo.</p>
<p>And what about those Makah, Maasai and Quechua people who don't want to 
follow the &quot;primitive pastoralist&quot; or &quot;hunter-gatherer&quot; 
lifestyles their ancestors have endured for the last 750 generations or more? 
What of the Massai tribesmen or tribeswomen who decide they want to own a car, 
or live in town, or become an airline pilot, or be something other than a 
subsistence-level pastoralist? Must their dreams and aspirations be sacrificed 
on the politically correct &quot;alter of cultural anthropology&quot;? What 
about the Quechua shepherdess who wants to &quot;get out of shepherding 
altogether&quot; and learn computer programming? Should she be 
&quot;shielded&quot; from such possibilities by &quot;Western Ivy-League 
anthropologists&quot; who have decided the subsistence-farming future of her 
people might be threatened if some individuals learn they can opt for a 
high-tech future? What of the Australian aborigine who wants to learn tensor 
mathematics or scientific biomedicine? Do the ethnoscience-advocating cultural 
anthropologists have the right to tell such individuals &quot;forget about it: 
you're already an 'ethnoscientist'&quot;?</p>
<p>Harvard professor of Physics and History of Science, Gerald Holton, in his 
book &quot;Science and Anti-science&quot; (1993, 147) identifies what he calls 
&quot;.the single most malignant part of the [anti-science] phenomenon: the 
type of pseudoscientific nonsense that manages to pass itself off as an 
&quot;alternative&quot; science,<i>and does so in the service of political 
ambition.</i>&quot; [Emphasis in original.] </p>
<p>He continues (1993, 153): </p> 
<blockquote> Today there exist a number of different groups which from their 
various perspectives oppose what they conceive of as the hegemony of 
science-as-done-today in our culture. These groups do not form a coherent 
movement, and indeed have little interest in one another; some focus on the 
epistemological claims of science, others on its effects via technology, others 
still long for a return to a romanticized pre-modern version of science. But 
what they do have in common is that each, in its own way, advocates nothing 
less than the end of science as we know it. That is what makes these disparate 
assemblages operationally members of a loose consortium. </blockquote> Here's 
what Dr. McCorkle has to say about the role of science, and the 
&quot;limitations&quot; of science, in evaluating ethnomedicine:
<blockquote> Pg. 735: At another level, experiences in human ethnomedicine 
suggest that researchers using conventional scientific methodologies may 
overlook some mechanisms by which natural medicines produce their effect. This 
neglect probably results from a narrow conception of therapeutic action. (For a 
striking example from cancer research, see Bodeker, 1994b.) The larger lesson 
here is the need to devise new, innovative research designs rather than 
mindlessly cleaving to conventional methodologic dogma. </blockquote> We can 
only guess what &quot;mechanisms&quot; Dr. McCorkle feels science has 
&quot;overlooked.&quot; Might they include things like the imaginary ebb and 
flow of qi? What about the influences of<i>prana</i>?. or homeopathic 
&quot;miasms&quot;?. or the influences of demons or &quot;evil winds&quot;? Of 
course, science is obliged to ignore &quot;mechanisms&quot; for which there 
isn't a shred of objective evidence.
<p>Dr. McCorkle seems convinced that, for whatever reason, &quot;conventional 
Western&quot; science is incapable of employing an 
&quot;interdisciplinary&quot; approach to medical and herd health issues in the 
Third World. Apparently she has spent many years in Third World countries 
studying such matters from an anthropological perspective, so I'm willing to 
assume, for the moment, that such interdisciplinary scientific efforts have 
either not been widely attempted or have not been particularly successful in 
the past. It's certainly unfortunate if such is the case, and it comes as a bit 
of surprise in view of the many recent triumphs of modern interdisciplinary 
science in other areas. On the other hand, Dr. McCorkle hasn't offered any 
coherent reason to assume that properly designed scientific approaches to these 
issues should not work. In all the examples she cites, the problems involved 
would seem to be entirely amenable to the skills of parasitologists, 
epidemiologists, agronomists, pharmacologists, phytopharmacognosists and other 
scientists working in concert with scientific bio-medical practitioners, 
economists, sociologists, and anthropologists. Dr. McCorkle seems to think that 
&quot;conventional Western&quot; scientists are inherently incapable of 
considering the subjective, informally gathered anecdotal data offered by 
indigenous non-scientist farmers, pastoralists and healers. In other words, she 
is suggesting that &quot;conventional Western&quot; scientists are destined to 
always overlook a significant portion of the pertinent data. The fact is that 
competent scientists, by their training, do their best not to overlook any 
pertinent data. Since bona fide science is an inherently flexible rather than 
dogmatic method, integrating such data and sources of information should pose 
no insurmountable problems.</p>
<p>It's ironic that, just as this chapter was coming into print, the 
millennia-old scourge of smallpox was finally being eliminated from the face of 
the Earth. Of course, in recent decades, smallpox has been almost entirely a 
&quot;Third World&quot; problem. Its eradication will ultimately save millions 
of Third World lives, and it was accomplished entirely by means of plain old 
&quot;conventional Western&quot; science and medicine. It would be unfair and 
incorrect for me to suggest that cultural anthropology and ethnomedicine played 
no part in the struggle to eliminate smallpox. To the contrary, these two 
&quot;disciplines&quot; have significantly impacted the effort, but not in a 
way most readers might anticipate.[13] </p> 
<blockquote> Frederique Apffel Marglin, a well-known anthropologist from a 
well-known American university, with the full endorsement of India's foremost 
social scientists, recently declared that the eradication of smallpox from 
India using modern cowpox-based vaccine was an affront to the local custom of 
variolation, which included inoculation with human smallpox matter accompanied 
by prayers to the goddess of smallpox, Sitala Devi. Despite her own admission 
that the traditional variolation is at least 10 times more likely to actually 
cause the disease as compared to the modern vaccine, Marglin persists in 
deriding the introduction of modern vaccine in India by the British (and the 
latter support of mass-vaccination programs by the government of independent 
India) as an imposition of &quot;Western logocentric mode of thought,&quot; 
which treats health as a binary opposite of illness, over the &quot;Indic&quot; 
nonlogocentric, binary-denying view, which treats the goddess Sitala as both 
the disease and its absence (A. Marglin, 1990). Marglin defends those who 
resisted the modern vaccine in the name of the goddess as fighting for a form 
of life that does not distinguish between natural and supernatural forces. 
</blockquote> Though somewhat obscured by discussion of the ethnoveterinary 
medical benefits sure to be reaped by &quot;stockraisers&quot; worldwide, Dr. 
McCorkle's cultural anthropology training and cultural constructivist/cultural 
relativist ideology are discernable throughout this work.
<p>The concept of &quot;cultural relativism&quot; was introduced into cultural 
anthropology several decades ago as a means of studying various non-western 
cultures without bias. The idea was that, in order to truly understand such 
cultures, one must examine them on an entirely &quot;value free&quot; basis. In 
other words, investigators were obliged to assiduously resist the temptation to 
evaluate such cultures in relation to Western culture. Prior to that time, the 
work of many anthropologists had been grossly tainted by their personal 
prejudices and Western values. In the context of cultural anthropology, 
cultural relativism is a rational, effective, and otherwise wonderful idea. In 
almost every other context, it's less than worthless, and therein lies the rub.
</p>
<p>The far more radical notion of cultural constructivism developed from 
cultural relativism. Cultural constructivists insist that all science, all 
facts, all knowledge, and even reality itself are merely subjective 
&quot;cultural constructs,&quot; and that one is no more &quot;valid&quot; than 
any other. This perspective is embodied by what philosophers of science have 
termed &quot;the 'strong' program in sociology of knowledge.&quot; Professor of 
Philosophy, Christopher Norris, has observed that cultural relativist 
literature has been much more widely and enthusiastically embraced by 
&quot;cultural theorists and socio-historians of science&quot; than has 
positive rationalist alternatives. He attributes this trend to a couple of 
factors:[14] </p> 
<blockquote> These have to do with the current predominance of anti-realist 
and cultural relativist thinking in disciplines whose chief objective is to 
cast doubt on the truth-claims, methods, and evaluative procedures of the 
natural sciences. Above all, they reject [the premise] that there exists a 
real-world (mind- and theory-independent) physical domain whose properties are 
the object of scientific knowledge and whose better understanding is the prime 
source of technological advance. </blockquote> The antitheses of cultural 
constructivism and post-modernism are rational positivism (or realism) and 
modernism. While they might not realize it, most readers here, and virtually 
all scientists, are rational positivists and modernists. Rational positivists 
hold that there is such a thing as objective reality, that the universe is at 
least potentially understandable, that it is subject to immutable physical 
laws, and, like their modernist brethren, that the European Enlightenment and 
post-Enlightenment discoveries of Galileo, Kepler, Newton, Dalton, Kelvin, 
Maxwell, Planck, Heisenberg and Einstein have resulted in an ever-more accurate 
image of the Universe and an ever-deeper understanding of how the Universe 
works. For rational positivists, objective facts exist and objective reality 
exists - independent of, and without regard to, personal beliefs, cultural 
constructs, or wishful thinking.
<p>It seems that many, if not most, cultural anthropologists (and their 
cultural constructivist kin, the post-modernists) have long since denied the 
all important distinction between the concept of &quot;value-free 
examination&quot; of other cultures as a tool and the philosophical conviction 
that all cultural entities are literally of equal value. (Actually, this is not 
entirely true: many cultural relativists and post-modernists are happy to 
disparage anything and everything they view as &quot;Western&quot; - especially 
science.)</p>
<p>The single great &quot;Truth&quot; cultural constructivists and 
post-modernists have to offer is that &quot;Western&quot; science is really 
nothing special. It's quite literally &quot;just another way of knowing.&quot; 
It seems pretty obvious that Dr. McCorkle's attempt to turn folk medicine into 
science merely by defining it as such (and, of course, by declaring that 
legitimate science is not only an arbitrary &quot;Western social 
construct,&quot; but merely &quot;another way of knowing&quot;) is a clear 
reflection of her background in cultural anthropology. Cultural anthropology, 
sociology and literary criticism are among the primary vectors of cultural 
relativism and post-modernist anti-science in Western academia. Indeed, 
cultural anthropology and the sub-specialty of medical anthropology, have - to 
a large extent -- attempted to gain the cache (if not literally become) genuine 
sciences, not by actually living up to the standards of science or proceeding 
on scientific principles, but merely by defining themselves as sciences. (I 
realize that at least some cultural anthropologists have lamented and even 
tried to resist this &quot;tide&quot; within their fields. I hope these 
individuals will forgive me if they feel I'm painting with too broad a stroke 
here.) When one reads the speakers lists for symposia on medical anthropology 
and the names of faculty or board members of pertinent organizations, one is 
likely to be immediately struck by the dearth or complete absence of physicians 
(M.D.s), scientific biomedical health professionals and scientists.</p>
<p>As others have observed, this bizarre situation undoubtedly stems in large 
part from the fact that, in view of the stunning successes of science and 
technology in the decades following WWII, the subjective musing and 
&quot;theories&quot; (conjectures) of sociologists, cultural anthropologists, 
literary critics, and other scholars in the &quot;arts and humanities&quot; 
seemed ever more arcane and irrelevant. Starting in the 1950s and 60s, more 
than a few &quot;social scientists&quot; developed severe cases of what has 
been termed &quot;physics envy,&quot; (though the malaise certainly involves 
similar resentment toward mathematics, chemistry, physiology, genetics, biology 
and virtually all other bona fide sciences). The core of the problem, of 
course, is that real science tends to work, and most &quot;other ways of 
knowing&quot; - including social and political &quot;sciences&quot; and 
cultural anthropology - tend not to work very well, or at least they fail to 
yield tangible and consistent results.</p>
<p>Rather than addressing the inherent deficiencies in their belief systems, 
some cultural and medical anthropologists have, instead, focused their energies 
on discrediting legitimate science under the rubric of cultural relativism. Of 
course, modern science has been so wildly successful that it's only feasible to 
effectively malign and depreciate it if one willfully mischaracterizes and 
misapprehends it. This is precisely what the post-modernists and cultural 
relativists have done. Many of the most prominent post-modernist 
&quot;theorists&quot; appear to be quite proud of the fact that they are 
&quot;untainted&quot; by any scientific training whatever - as though not 
learning about science from other scientists and not being able to actually do 
science are somehow key to truly understanding it. Ironically, some such 
&quot;theorists&quot; describe themselves as &quot;philosophers of 
science.&quot;</p>
<p>If one really takes a close look at the &quot;ethnoscience&quot; and 
&quot;ethnomedicine&quot; literature, one learns that that not only are 
practitioners of &quot;Western&quot; scientific biomedicine &quot;of no more or 
less benefit to patients&quot; than shamans and witchdoctors (i.e., 
&quot;ethno-medical practitioners and ethnoscientists&quot;), they differ only 
in the<i>kinds</i> of healing magic they administer. Of course, not 
understanding science and believing in magic are helpful if one hopes to hold 
such a view. In a recent personal correspondence, one medical anthropologist 
told me that the notion that science has developed a more objective and 
accurate image and understanding of the Universe than any other system of 
knowing is a &quot;discredited post-Enlightenment myth.&quot; Since the current 
post-modernist, cultural constructivist movement in academia is intent upon 
repudiating and undoing the intellectual accomplishments of the Enlightenment, 
I propose that we refer to their objective as the &quot;Unenlightenment.&quot;
</p>
<p>The consensus view among proponents of cultural constructivism, 
post-modernism, and ethnoscience seems to be that the &quot;scientific 
revolution&quot; was merely a Western ethnic fantasy. From this perspective, 
all that has really happened to Western culture since the Enlightenment is that 
we've traded one type of &quot;ethnoscience&quot; for another, and the latter 
version is not one whit &quot;better&quot; or more inherently effective than 
the former. (Please pay no attention to the jet aircraft roaring overhead, the 
electronic telecommunication devices all around you, or the fact you somehow 
managed not to die from smallpox or polio while growing up. These are all 
ethnocentric fantasies.) A few of the more avant garde intellectuals of the 
movement have even made the earth-shattering discoveries that all knowledge is 
subjective and therefore arbitrary and that objective reality, itself, is an 
illusion. (For reasons known only to themselves, unfortunately few 
post-modernist intellectuals have chosen to prove the point by jumping out of 
airplanes without parachutes.)</p>
<p>Cultural anthropology, and the subdiscipline of medical anthropology, 
ostensibly involve the dispassionate study of culture and medical systems. The 
proposed scope of ERD&amp;E far exceeds the boundaries of mere examination and 
analysis. It clearly constitutes a broad, sweeping and pro-active attempt to 
manipulate and radically re-engineer the sociology of veterinary healthcare 
delivery in the Third World - putatively for the benefit of both local and 
international stockraisers. Moreover, the ERD&amp;E movement seems to embody 
the &quot;vision&quot; of a small group of Western intellectuals who hope to 
impose a particular philosophy and dogma on said healthcare delivery systems. 
This philosophy seems to be deeply rooted in the anti-science and 
anti-rationalist tenets of cultural relativism, cultural constructivism, and 
post-modernism. These hold that whereas genuine science is &quot;just another 
way of obtaining knowledge&quot; and merely a &quot;Western cultural 
construct,&quot; traditional and folk medical systems are not only 
&quot;sciences&quot; in and of themselves, but deserve higher status and should 
command greater authority than &quot;outsider&quot; (etic) &quot;Western&quot; 
science.</p>
<p>The final section of Dr. McCorkle's chapter bears the heading: &quot;Back 
to the Future.&quot; Sooner or later, the intended beneficiaries of 
&quot;ethnoveterinary medicine&quot; and &quot;ethnoscience&quot; are going to 
figure out that these &quot;disciplines,&quot; unlike their bona fide 
scientific alternatives, are not only examples of the &quot;Western 
'etic'&quot; proponents so adamantly disparage, they're based on the 
intellectually bankrupt anti-science dogma of cultural constructivism and 
post-modernism. Rather than taking Third World agriculturalists &quot;back to 
the future,&quot; ethnoveterinary medicine seems more likely to keep them stuck 
in the past.<br>
