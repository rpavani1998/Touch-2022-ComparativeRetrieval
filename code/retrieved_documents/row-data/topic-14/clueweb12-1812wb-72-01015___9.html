<h2>10 Chinese Medicine Links You Must Bookmark</h2> 
<p> Posted on January 26, 2008 by Yael5 Comments </p> 
<p>The world wide web is packed with so many websites and blogs, that 
sometimes you just don&rsquo;t know how to reach them all, which is good and 
which is, well, not so good.<br>
 We will list here the 10 links of Chinese 
Medicine we think you must bookmark and visit, as they offer good content and 
important info.</p> 
<p>1. Deepest Health: Eric Grey&rsquo;s blog is one of the first stops I make 
every day as I start my Internet-round. I mentioned it on my links list and I 
will mention this blog in the future as it is, simply, a great and interesting 
blog. Period. Note it.</p>

<h2>Acupuncture vs. Herbs</h2> 
<p> Posted on January 18, 2008 by Yael7 Comments </p> 
<p>I must be honest with you: if this is the question, acupuncture vs. herbs- 
acupuncture will be the winner any day.<br>
 I don&rsquo;t mean to put down 
herbs, I really don&rsquo;t, I just don&rsquo;t like them very much. As I see 
their benefits and think that they are very powerful, studying them is almost 
like a punishment, and let&rsquo;s face it- it&rsquo;s just not fun!</p> 
<p>But acupuncture- now there&rsquo;s an art! There&rsquo;s a place to be 
creative.<br>
 Yes, I can hear all those herb-people saying &ldquo;but you can 
be very creative with herbs too!&rdquo;, but it&rsquo;s just not the same.<br>
 
OK, ok, I will tell you the tale of my struggle with Chinese herbs, which will 
explain why I don&rsquo;t like &lsquo;em, I just don&rsquo;t.</p>

<h2>Dr. Leon Hammer</h2> 
<p> Posted on January 9, 2008 by Yael5 Comments </p> 
<p>I was lucky enough to have a short correspondence with Dr. Leon Hammer, a 
psychiatrist turned CM practitioner.<br>
 Those who don&rsquo;t know Dr. Hammer 
should really update their knowledge about the man who contributed an amazing 
book to our shelves, a book called &ldquo;Dragon Rises, Red Bird Flies&ldquo;. 
In the book he shows, among other things, how CM can be used to treat the Shen, 
and he brings us Dr. Shen&rsquo;s theory- his own teacher and mentor.</p> 
<p>Dr. Hammer was born in the USA on 1922.<br>
 During the years between 
1948-1970 he dedicated himself to psychoanalysis and psychiatry, in which he 
studied the treatment of children, various psychological approaches (Gestalt 
for example) and Hypnosis.<br>
 In 1971 he started studying Chinese Medicine 
with Dr. Van Buren.<br>
 In 1974, Dr. Hammer met Dr. Shen, his biggest 
influence in CM. Until 1989, Dr. Hammer studied many aspects of CM such as 
Auriculotherapy, Chinese Herbs, 5 Elements and more.</p>

<h2>Defending Chinese Medicine- part 1</h2> 
<p> Posted on December 24, 2007 by Yael6 Comments </p> 
<p> I&rsquo;ll start by saying that this is going to be long.<br>
 The article 
we talk about here is 7 pages long, and- well, we had a lot to say about it. So 
this will be a two part post.<br>
 
******************************************************<br>
 We surf the net in 
search of more information about Chinese Medicine on a regular basis.<br>
 We 
foundthis article on a website called Quack Watch.<br>
 At first we went 
through the article, thinking this is yet another person who thinks he knows 
something about CM (but really doesn&rsquo;t), but we saw that the person 
writing the article has very strong opinions in regards of the CM, how 
effective and what stands behind it. When we come across a text which puts 
down, insults and disrespects CM, we make it a point to read it carefully, 
thinking that the text is based on ignorance and a negative pre-disposition 
regarding CM and Alternative Medicine in general.<br>
 Dr. Stephen Barrett did 
not fail us, and indeed, his article is based on more false things than true.
<br> Let&rsquo;s read it together shall we?</p> 
<p>The 2 opening phrases clearly show that the distinguished doctor did not do 
his research properly.<br>
 If he had, he would know that there is more to CM 
than just TCM, and that Chinese Medicine doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean TCM. 
Also, there is no mention of Chinese herbs, which is ancient, in-depth and has 
very clear evidence to it&rsquo;s effects. There is no mention of Tuina either. 
In the second paragraph we are witnessing complete lies and misguidance of the 
public. There is no &ldquo;injection of sterile water, procaine, morphine, 
vitamins or homeopathic solutions through the needles&rdquo;. Of course he 
fails to mention that the needles are sterile and are not to be used more than 
once.<br>
 Between you and me, if he would have done his homework properly, he 
would know better than to mention homeopathy, because than he would know that 
you don&rsquo;t mix CM with homeopathy.<br>
 Throughout the article, Dr. 
Barrett fails to mention that the Chinese Medicine is based on Chinese 
philosophy, which just might be important to mention when you remember that the 
Western Medicine and science is basically based onGreek philosophy. Did he fail 
to mention this because he didn&rsquo;t want to show something that both 
medicines have in common? After all, if he mentioned the Chinese philosophy, 
the &ldquo;mess&rdquo; that reflects from his article regarding Qi and 
acupuncture points could have been avoided, the reader would know that 
there&rsquo;s something behind it all.</p>

<h2>Chinese Medicine Books- first year</h2> 
<p> Posted on November 20, 2007 by YaelNo Comments </p> 
<p>Many 1st year students don&rsquo;t really know which are the best books to 
buy. Some of them just buy everything they can get their hands on- which 
isn&rsquo;t a very good way to go, one reason is that it&rsquo;s pretty 
expensive, and another reason is that many books that are recommended by the 
school are still in a very strange language which you just started to learn 
(Chinese Medicine).<br>
 Others don&rsquo;t buy books at all- which is 
definifly not a good way to go! When studying Chinese Medicine, one should 
remember to buy books, but one should always try to make a good decision on 
what to buy.</p> 
<p>So we will try to give you a number of ideas for that good decision, giving 
you titles we think just might help you along the way and make your first year 
easier.</p>

<h2>Chinese Medicine Notes Blog- What &amp; Why</h2> 
<p> Posted on November 11, 2007 by Yael7 Comments </p> 
<p>Hi everyone, We are happy to be writing these words, as we are starting the 
new blog which we hope will be a main source of information about Chinese 
Medicine for you all. We were thinking about what should be a good way to start 
this new platform, and we have decided that it&rsquo;s best to start with 
introducing this blog&rsquo;s intentions and missions:</p> 
<p>This blog is going to grow due to the love we have for Chinese Medicine, 
and will have 100% Chinese Medicine oriented content. This blog aims to be a 
place to all those who are interested in Chinese Medicine- those of you who are 
interested in this field, those who are students of this wonderful philosophy, 
those who want to be students but just didn&rsquo;t get round to it, those who 
are patients and want to know more about what their practitioner just did when 
he used that needle around the elbow&hellip; Chinese Medicine Notes will 
provide important information on various topics, and hopefully it will become 
one of your regular stops on the world wide web, giving you interesting things 
to read while taking a break from work or drinking your first cup of coffee in 
the morning (or herbal tea, which ever you prefer).</p>
