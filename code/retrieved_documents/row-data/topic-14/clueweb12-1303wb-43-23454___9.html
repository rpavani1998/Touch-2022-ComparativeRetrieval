<p>Will it hurt?<br>
 When many people think of needles, their first thought 
is of the hypodermic needles used for medical injections. These needles are 
stiff, hollow, and thick for forcing fluid into the patient&rsquo;s flesh. 
Happily, acupuncture needles are nothing like this! Modern acupuncture needles 
are fine and flexible, about as big around as a hair or a piece of thread.</p> 
<p>When the needle is inserted into the skin, it is common for the patient to 
feel little, if any, sensation. Once the needle is in place, the acupuncturist 
may stimulate the needle by turning or otherwise moving it. This<br>
 is done 
in order to &ldquo;reach the Qi&rdquo; (pronounced &lsquo;chee&rsquo;) - 
meaning to access the energy of the body with the needle. When this happens, it 
is normal for the patient to feel one or more of the following sensations: a<br>
 spreading sensation, heaviness at the needle site, warmth, tingling, a sense 
of movement within the body, or an electric feeling. Most people find the 
experience to be quite relaxing and some may even fall asleep!</p> 
<p>Do you re-use needles?<br>
 No, modern acupuncture needles are not re-used. 
They are sterile, single-use stainless steel needles, and they are disposed of 
immediately after your treatment.</p>

<p>What happens during a treatment?<br>
You should prepare for your treatment 
by eating a light meal beforehand, drinking plenty of fresh water, and wearing 
loose, comfortable clothing that is easily pulled up over your elbows and 
knees. If you are taking prescription medication, be sure to bring a list of 
the medications you are taking. Your first visit will last about one and one 
half hours, and 45 minutes to an hour for subsequent visits.</p> 
<p>Before your first visit, you will be asked to fill out an extensive health 
history questionnaire that will help guide the practitioner to her diagnosis. 
To begin your visit, the acupuncturist will do a comprehensive intake and exam, 
which will consist of asking numerous questions about your primary complaint as 
well as more general health issues, and performing any relevant physical exams. 
Often patients are surprised to find that many of their disparate health 
concerns are interrelated according to Chinese medical theory. The practitioner 
will then ask to see your tongue. In Chinese medicine, the appearance of the 
tongue tells many things about the patient&rsquo;s overall health. She will 
then feel the pulses on both your wrists. Over twenty-six subtle variations in 
the quality of the pulse can be felt at six different positions on each wrist.
</p> 
<p>The acupuncturist will use all the information she has gathered to 
determine your diagnosis according to traditional Chinese medical theory. She 
will formulate a treatment plan including which acupuncture points to use, and 
whether or not to prescribe herbal medicine for you.Once this is done, your 
actual treatment will<strong><strong></strong></strong>begin. Generally the 
patient is treated while lying down on a massage table, on some occasions the 
patient may be seated. The acupuncturist will insert the needles, and then make 
sure you are comfortable. She will allow you to relax and rest, retaining the 
needles for about 15 minutes.* She will then remove the needles, and your 
treatment will be over.</p> 
<p>* At some point during your treatment your acupuncturist may choose to 
employ one of many additional modalities such as:</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong></strong><strong>Moxibustion</strong>: the herb mugwort (artemesia 
vulgaris, or &lsquo;moxa&rsquo;) is rolled into cones or cylinders and burned 
near the skin as a warming therapy, to increase the speed of tissue healing, 
and to add energy to the body.</p> 
<p><strong>Cupping</strong>: glass cups are used to create a vaccum on the 
skin to increase warmth and circulation.</p> 
<p><strong>Gua Sha</strong>: a gentle scraping of the skin surface using a 
soft-edged gua sha tool to increase circulation.</p> 
<p><strong>Far-infrared Heat Therapy</strong>: administered using a heat lamp, 
it increases the speed of tissue healing, and is very soothing.</p> 
<p><strong>Electrical Stimulation</strong> (e-stim): a gentle and safe 
electrical current is run through the needles. Feels like a gentle tapping at 
the needle site.</p> 
<p><strong>Chinese style massage</strong>, or application of <strong>herbal 
liniments</strong>.</p> 
<p>back to top</p> 
<p>How many treatments will I need?<br>
<strong></strong>Because every patient 
is different, every case is different. In general, most patients feel some sort 
of change<strong><strong><strong></strong></strong></strong>after the first 
visit (either immediately, or after a few hours). Most health problems take 
more than one<br>
<strong><strong><strong><strong><strong></strong></strong>
</strong></strong></strong>treatment to resolve, so expect to have four 
treatments before a reassessment.</p> 
<p><strong></strong>If the problem is chronic, it generally requires more 
treatments. However, if it is an acute problem, it may be resolved in as little 
as three visits or less! This all depends on such factors as the severity of 
the complaint, how long-standing it has been, and the extent to which the 
patient&rsquo;s daily activities aggravate the condition. Along the course of 
treatment, you should see an overall improvement in your health as your main 
complaint improves.</p> 
<p>Can my child be treated?<br>
Yes, Chinese medicine can be very beneficial 
for a host of childhood problems, including but not limited to colds, fevers, 
colic, acute and chronic ear infections, diarrhea, constipation, enuresis 
(bedwetting), and<br>
 Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD). While we do not 
usually use needles on small children, Chinese Pediatric Massage on acupuncture 
points is a very effective method of treatment.</p> 
<p>It is also common to use electrical stimulation - by hooking up a small 
metal rod to an e-stim machine, we can deliver a gentle, comfortable current to 
the child&rsquo;s skin, thus activating the acupuncture points. Small doses of 
Chinese herbal medicine are also very effective in treating pediatric 
conditions. When treated with Chinese medicine, children&rsquo;s health issues 
tend to resolve even more quickly than adults&rsquo;, due to children&rsquo;s 
relatively &ldquo;pure&rdquo; natures.</p> 
<p>back to top</p> 
<p>How are herbs used in Chinese medicine?<br>
 Plants and other natural 
substances have been used for medicinal purposes for thousands of years. It is 
from this practice that modern day pharmacology has emerged. In Chinese 
herbology, herbs are used in specific,individualized formulations containing 
anywhere from two to twenty different herbs that work together synergistically 
(unlike western herbology which commonly uses one herb alone).</p> 
<p> Herbs are powerful medicinals which offer extraordinary results - when 
prescribed by a trained medical professional. When used properly, there are 
little to no side-effects.</p> 
<p> If your Oriental Medical Practitioner feels that herbs would benefit your 
condition, she will create a personalized formula for you using either dried 
granulated herbs that are made into a tea, raw herbs, or a pre-made pill or 
tincture formula.</p> 
<p>Can I have an herbal consultation without receiving acupuncture?<br>
 Yes. 
As well as being a Licensed Acupuncturist, Ms. Hawken is a Certified Chinese 
Herbalist, and would be happy to treat you exclusively with Chinese herbal 
medicine if that is what you prefer. Consider, though, that Chinese herbal 
medicine and acupuncture combine very well, and used together may speed the 
resolving of your condition.</p> 
<p>Can I benefit from treatment even if there is nothing wrong?<br>
 Yes, you 
can. Traditional Chinese medical theory states that a person is constantly in a 
state of dynamic balance. This means that a person's state of health is always 
changing, subtly moving in one direction oranother. Chinese medicine is focused 
on bringing the body, mind and spirit back into the center of this balance. 
There is an old Chinese saying, &quot;Don't wait until you're thirsty to dig a 
well.&quot; This emphasizes the conviction that staying healthy is much more 
valuable than having to recover from an illness. Preventative medicine is truly 
at the heart of Chinese medical theory. In fact, in ancient China, the 
acupuncturist was only paid as long as his patient was well!</p> 
<p>Because the diagnostic process of Chinese medicine relies on reading the 
state of balance of the patient (through methods such as pulse diagnosis and 
tongue reading), it is not necessary for you, as the patient, to report 
anything &quot;wrong&quot;.</p> 
<p> It is a wonderful idea, and a traditional one, to receive acupuncture 
treatment four times a year, at the change of seasons, to help the body cope 
with the stresses that the changing weather brings - even if the patient is 
feeling fine.</p>
