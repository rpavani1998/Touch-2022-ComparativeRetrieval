 Elective Memory Elective Memory <br>

<p>Was my elective the best eight weeks of medical school? It is supposed to 
be &ndash; it&rsquo;s the big carrot that is waved in front of you for five 
years to get you through the embryology and histology lectures. For me though, 
looking back after three years, I can&rsquo;t help but feel that I could have 
made more out of it.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>There are two main ways to approach your elective. You can go with some 
friends with the aim of clearing off after a couple of weeks in a hospital and 
learn a foreign language or how to surf. Alternatively, you can immerse 
yourself in the healthcare of a truly foreign environment. I think I got caught 
in the middle of these two.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>I went to Fiji and spent six weeks on the beautiful island of Levuka and 
the following two weeks exploring the rest of the islands. I spent my days at a 
small hospital run by three doctors. In the mornings there was a ward round and 
clinic. The wards were quite empty in general as anything serious was 
helicoptered out to the mainland. The clinics were a different story, but 
interestingly the most common thing I saw was hypertension, which is a huge 
problem in Fiji thanks to an unfortunate combination of genetic predisposition 
and fondness for fast foods. The treatments available weren&rsquo;t great 
&ndash; they got their supplies from charities based in New Zealand and when 
they ran out of one thing they just had to move to another.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>January in Fiji is a special time of year for many schoolchildren. When 
they reach about eight years old it is traditional to be circumcised. Many of 
the local parents were very keen to have their children circumcised by the 
&ldquo;white doctor&rdquo; and I was glad to get a bit more involved in things 
(most of the locals didn&rsquo;t speak much English so out-patients soon lost 
its novelty). I still enjoy telling my non-doctor friends about these 
operations and seeing the looks of horror on their faces.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The doctors and staff at the hospital were all fantastic. They were 
extremely welcoming and friendly and would take me out in the evenings and at 
weekends. The locals soon got to recognise me on the street and would shout 
&ldquo;ennui&rdquo;, meaning doctor, as took my daily walks to and from the 
hospital along a road with beautiful views out to sea.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean you can&rsquo;t help but feel that you could have 
made more out of it?&rdquo; I hear you gasp, perhaps with a &ldquo;you 
malcontent&rdquo; at the end. Well, if I was to go again I think I would try 
harder to push myself. I stayed at The Royal Hotel, a beautiful old colonial 
hotel frequented by backpackers. I had plenty of opportunities to get more 
experience of the local culture but every time I would decline and go and hang 
out with the backpackers. I also spent far too long reading a textbook as the 
fear of finals was growing.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>So if you&rsquo;re about to go on your elective and you&rsquo;re going so 
you can experience a different culture, my advice would be to resist the 
temptation to hang out with people from back home, and get off the tourist 
trail.</p>

 I 
enjoyed reading your experiences Tom.<br>
I went to New York for my elective 
and did a programme run and funded by Columbia University based in the lower 
East Side of Manhattan on Urban medicine, immigrant health care and palliative 
care. I shadowed a doctor who worked for St Vincents and went to clinics with 
her to Hostels for homeless people off Times Square, women refuges, HIV clinics 
and clinics for people with serious menatl health problems off Wall Street and 
palliative care (in the Bronx). I was the only Brit in a group of final year 
medical students and we met 4 nights a week for seminars. I experienced a part 
of New York you'd never normally get to to see. I leaned alot from my 
experiences and remain passionate about the city<br>
I have 2 good friends in 
New York as a result and reflect on my experiences quite frequently -given it's 
now 10 years ago.<br>
My advice would be simply to choose an elective 
experience that enables you to to experience and learn something new / 
different -that won't be so easy later on! Sunshine would have been nice-but I 
enjoyed experiencing New York in the snow.<br>

Thanks Kate. Your elective sounds amazing.<br>
<br>
Once you qualify it's hard 
to do anything like this without taking a year off - another factor to consider.

 Hello Tom, <br>
<br>
This is great experience! We 
don't have that kind of culture of electives in the universities here in Nepal 
(very very rare!!!) but we have electives from England, Germany, Scandanavian 
countries and some from France in my teaching hospital. I'm sure they have very 
different experience like yours by coming in Developing countries like Nepal!
<br>In fact, elective itself is a great concept and I think one should do. I 
had a lot of like this excursions (not exactly elective!) in condition to 
repeat the internship. It was really great. I did get involved researches and 
medical aid posts in High Himalayas of my country (Nepal).<br>
<br>
Thank you! 
<br> <br>
Best wishes, <br>

 Kate - I did the 
same one in February 1999, and loved it! Highly recommend it to anyone out 
there looking.<br>
<br>
My personal favorite was later in training, during 
residency, when I went to Cuba for nearly 2 months. For an American, this was a 
particularly unique experience - we're not allowed over there except under 
special programs.<br>
If anyone wants an elective in rural India, I could put 
you in touch with an amazing woman who runs a rural weaving collective and 
attendant hospital/clinic.  3/2/2009 2:15 AM GMT  on bmj.com <br>

 Oh gosh, I am boring. I did 
mine at the BMJ on a Clegg scholarship.<br>
I did get to go to an Evidence 
based medicine conference in San Francisico as part of it though.<br>
San 
Francisco gave me two strong memories.One was being first out of the hostel in 
the morning to go to work, and the police removing the body of a dead tramp 
from the doorstep. Second was going out for a meal with the BMJ staff - local 
and from London, and being entertained by Richard Smith (former editor) telling 
crazy stories.  4/2/2009 1:38 PM GMT  on bmj.com <br>

 I am so jealous of your NYC 
electives would have loved to do mine there! Having said that I thoroughly 
enjoyed my placements last summer. I chose to go to Los Angeles for five weeks 
followed by a month in Belize. Two very different locations! The genres of 
medicine I observed were also polar opposites.<br>
<br>
I arrived in LA on the 
Sunday and somehow navigated the bus system through the second largest city in 
the States on a Monday morning to Santa Monica. I was attached to the 
Integrative East-West Medical Centre, an air-conditioned glass and white walled 
haven of a workplace. And the medicine? A fusion of traditional Chinese and 
high tech Western Medicine. Ok ok so it might sound a little &quot;LA&quot; but 
the combination was really appealing to me as someone who would always prefer 
to try something natural and less toxic that some of the things we're 
prescribed. The pacific ocean half a mile away didn&rsquo;t hurt either! The 
clinicians were all MD's who had also trained in Traditional Chinese Medicine 
(for another three years at least!). Impressive teachers.<br>
<br>
I learnt 
acupuncture, cupping, acupressure massage and trigger point injections (a kind 
of supersized western acupuncture). I even mastered the basics of reading 
tongues. Contrary to what I was informed prior to arrival I was actually 
encouraged to take a hands on approach. I was allowed to clerk patients and 
help administer therapies and was really involved in the team. This surprised 
me as the picture older students had painted of American electives involved 
being made to stand in the corner with your hands tied for fear of being sued. 
I organised the placement through UCLA, they literally have hundreds of courses 
available in any area you can imagine-HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!<br>
<br>
I then went 
on to southern and extremely rural Belize in Central America-you can imagine 
the culture shock. Common conditions changed over night from laptop induced 
neck pain and headaches only relieved by Botox to scabies and diarrhoea. The 
whole two months were truly brilliant and I do think this had something to do 
with the enormous variety in the locations I chose.<br>

<br>  Hi Kate, Your elective sounds like something I would love to do! Im in 
the process of organising my elective at the moment- do you have the email 
address of someone I could contact about doing a similar programme to yours?
