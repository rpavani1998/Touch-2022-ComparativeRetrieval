<h2> Traditional Chinese Medicine</h2> 
<p></p> 
<h3>Definition</h3> 
<p>&quot;Is the current name for an ancient system of health care from China. 
TCM is based on a concept of balanced qi (pronounced &quot;chee&quot;), or 
vital energy, that is believed to flow throughout the body. Qi is proposed to 
regulate a person's spiritual, emotional, mental, and physical balance and to 
be influenced by the opposing forces of yin (negative energy) and yang 
(positive energy). Disease is proposed to result from the flow of qi being 
disrupted and yin and yang becoming imbalanced. Among the components of TCM are 
herbal and nutritional therapy, restorative physical exercises, meditation, 
acupuncture, and remedial massage&quot;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&quot;An ancient and still very vital holistic system of health and 
healing, based on the notion of harmony and balance, and employing the ideas of 
moderation and prevention. Traditional Chinese medicine seeks to harmonize and 
rebalance the entire human system rather than to treat just symptoms. Since 
proper internal balance is considered to be the key to human health, TCM 
strives to cure disease by restoring that balance and therefore allowing the 
body to repair itself. Its continuing medical goal is to detect and correct 
abnormalities before they cause permanent physical damage&quot;.</p> 
<p>&quot;A complete system of health-care with its own unique theories of 
anatomy, health, and treatment. It emphasizes diet and prevention and using 
acupuncture, herbal medicine, massage, and exercise; and focuses on stimulating 
the body's natural curative powers&quot;.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&quot;A range of traditional medical practices originating in China that 
developed over several thousand years. These practices include theories, 
diagnosis and treatments such as herbal medicine, acupuncture and massage; 
often Qigong is also strongly affiliated with TCM. TCM is a form of Oriental 
medicine, which includes other traditional East Asian medical systems such as 
traditional Japanese, and Korean medicine&quot;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Chinese traditional medicine comprises four interrelated therapies: Zhong 
Yao (herbal medicine), Zhen Jiu (acupuncture and moxibustion), Qi Gong (vital 
energy exercises), and Tui Na (therapeutic massage), although some purists 
prefer not to include the latter two theories. There is no distinct demarcation 
between clinical medicine and public health practice. Chinese traditional 
medicine considers a person's well-being physically and mentally. It approaches 
health with due consideration to nature in all its complexity and 
multidimensionality. Enhancing natural healing is central to Chinese medical 
practice. The basic concepts underlying all Chinese medical therapies are the 
Taoist doctrine of yin and yang (the theory of opposites); the five elements 
(metal, wood, water, fire, and earth); and &quot;Qi&quot; (pronounced chee), 
the vital energy of life that circulates in the human body via a system of 
pathways.</p>

<p>&quot;Is based on a set of interventions designed to restore balance to 
human beings. The therapies usually considered under the heading of classic 
Chinese medicine include acupunture and moxibustion, dietary regulation, herbal 
remedies, massage and therapeutic exercise. These forms of treatments are based 
upon beliefs that differ from the disease concept favored by Western medicine. 
What is referred to as illness by Western medicine is considered in traditional 
Chinese medicine to be a matter of disharmony or imbalance&quot;</p>
