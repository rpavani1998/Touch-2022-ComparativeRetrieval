<h2>Interview with Karma Senge about Kyere Gompa</h2> 
<p> <i>Photograph by Marvin Moore</i></p> <br>
<br>

<p><i>Halifax, 10 July 2005</i></p> 
<p><i>The following conversation with Karma Senge (Karseng) Rinpoche was 
interpreted by Peter Roberts, transcribed by Jessie Litven (who has since 
become an apprentice with the Nalanda Translation Committee), and reviewed by 
Larry Mermelstein. We are pleased to have the opportunity to work with the 
translators. A condensed version of this interview is available on theNTC site. 
Karseng Rinpoche's brother, Sonam Wangdu, was present during the interview.</i>
</p> 
<p><i>Kyere, a remote area about 25 air miles south of D&uuml;dtsi-til, has 
been home to Trungpa Rinpoche's immediate family since he left Tibet in 1959. 
In this interview Karma Senge Rinpoche talks a little bit about the history of 
Kyere Gompa, the needs of the people in the region, and his plans to build a 
medical clinic there. We have also provided a way for people to contribute 
towards this project. Please see<i>How to donate funds</i> below. </i></p> 
<p>WF: Rinpoche, rather than asking you for further stories about Trungpa 
Rinpoche today, I'd like to ask you to talk about Kyere Gompa (monastery). I'd 
also like to ask about your family, Trungpa Rinpoche's family&#151;your 
brothers and sisters and other family members who are living in Kyere and 
elsewhere in Kham. I think many of us would like to know how things are there 
and what your needs are. Hopefully the Chronicles could encourage donations 
that will help support the work that you are doing and needs of the people in 
Kyere.</p> 
<p>Karma Senge: The founder of Kyere Gompa was Khyungdrak Dorje. He was one of 
the N&uuml;den Dorje tert&ouml;ns of two categories of eight and 16 tert&ouml;n 
Lingpas. So there are different classes of tertons, the nine Lingspas, and the 
108 Lingpas. So it seems Khyungdrak Dorje was one among these nine N&uuml;den 
Dorjes1. </p>
<p>According to Jamg&ouml;n Kongtr&uuml;l's biography of the 108 Tert&ouml;ns, 
Khyungdrak Dorje was a contemporary of the 10th Karmapa, the first Mingyur 
Dorje, and the fifth Dalai Lama. Though it's not entirely clear, Kyere Gompa 
was probably founded in the water female ox year of the tenth sixty year cycle 
[1673]. So the monastery has been around since then. But it went through a 
period of decline.</p> 
<p>_____________________</p> 
<p>Khyungdrak Dorje's<br>
t&uuml;lku</p> 
<p><br>
Steven Seagal</p> 
<p>In February of 1997, His Holiness Penor Rinpoche recognized the Hollywood 
action star, Steven Seagal as an incarnation of Khyungdrak Dorje, the founder 
of Kyere Gompa. Here is aletter from Penor Rinpoche regarding Mr. Seagal. 
Although Karma Senge Rinpoche and Mr. Seagal have not met face to face, they 
had several video conferences during KSR's visit to North America last summer.
</p> 
<p>_____________________</p> <br>
<br>

<p>The patron responsible for the revival and rebuilding of Kyere Gompa was 
the 50th King of Lha-thok, Sonam Gyurme. There are four kingdoms of Kham: 
Lha-thok, Dege, Ling, and Nangchen. These were independent kingdoms, neither 
under Tibet nor under China, and they all had equal status. So the King of 
Lha-thok, Sonam Gyurme, revived Kyere Gompa for his lama the 10th Trungpa 
Rinpoche, Ch&ouml;kyi Nyinche. The two of them revived Kyere Monastery together.
</p>
<p>WF: So that was just in the last 100 years? </p>
<p>KSR: Yes, about 100 years. They built a slightly larger temple than that of 
Khyungdrak Dorje and they created a retreat center for the nyengy&uuml;2. There 
were 100 families who lived near Kyere Gompa who were tied to the monastery. 
Everyone in the Lha-thok had to pay taxes to the king. So instead of paying the 
king, these families paid the monastery. Every year Kyere Gompa received 
something like 100,000 yuan from these families [US $12,500 at current exchange 
rates]. This income supported the practices that where done at Kyere Gompa. 
Many great practices were performed each year, including</p> 
<p></p> <br>

<p>the <i>Drupchen of Dorje Phurba</i> [San. Vajrakilaya] according to Ratna 
Lingpa, Ratna Lingpa's Vajrakilaya, which took a month to complete,</p> <br>

<p>Rolpa Dorje's terma called <i>Deshek Tobd&uuml;</i>, The Concentrated Power 
of the Tathagathas, which also lasted for one month,</p> <br>

<p>the <i>Khandro Tsok Gar</i>, the Ganachakra Dance of the Dakinis, which 
took ten days.</p> <br>

<p>the practice of the Four Armed Mahakala,</p> <br>

<p>and then, after the 10th Trungpa, there was the 11th Trungpa and at the 
time, the<i>Tsasum Gongd&uuml;</i>, (&quot;Embodied Realization of the Three 
Roots&quot;) was established.</p> <br>
<br>

<p>Both the 10th and the 11th Trungpa spent about five to six months there 
each year. In particular, the 10th Trungpa would do a hundred pairs of nyungne 
each year at Kyere Gompa.</p>
<p>WF: Nyungne? </p>
<p>KSR: Nyungne, the fasting practice. Each one lasts two days, so he did 100 
nyungnes in 200 days. The 2nd day you don't eat or drink at all, and you don't 
speak. The first day you don't eat after noon, but you can drink. The second 
day, you don't need to drink, just practice all day. You also do ten 
circumambulations every day.</p>
<p>After the nyungnes, the 10th Trungpa would give everyone the nyungne 
empowerment, instructions and teachings. Each day there would be between 200 to 
500 people practicing the nyungne with the 10th Trunpga. It varied, but it was 
never less than 200 people. There's a continuation of that even now; many 
people practice nyungne at Kyere Gompa. One lama in particular has been 
practicing nyungne for about 15 years without a break.</p>

<p>WF: Were the 10th and 11th Trungpas the main Rinpoches for Kyere Gompa? </p>
<p>KSR: The 10th Trungpa was the main Rinpoche. It was his monastery. The land 
where Kyere Gompa is located is part of Lha-thok.</p>
<p>WF: And D&uuml;dtsi-til is not part of Lha-thok? </p>
<p>KSR: No, D&uuml;dtsi-til is in Nangchen. </p>
<p>WF: But Surmang is the whole area? </p>
<p>KSR: No. </p>
<p>WF: I thought Kyere was one of the Surmang monasteries. </p>
<p>KSR: Yes, it is a Surmang monastery. But it's not a part of the Surmang 
land. The King of Lha-thok offered it to the 10th Trungpa. Because of that, the 
land, the monastery and everything now belongs to Surmang.</p>
<p>WF: Was the 11th Trungpa the main tulku for Kyere Gompa? </p>
<p>KSR: Yes, he was the principle one. </p>
<p>WF: I understand that before Trungpa Rinpoche left Tibet, he moved his 
family from D&uuml;dtsi-til to Kyere because he felt it would be safer for them 
there.</p>
<p>KSR: Yes. Before Trungpa Rinpoche left for India, he was staying at Tsawa 
Gang3. One day he sent two monks named Tsado and S&ouml;nam Tseten to Surmang 
with a message for his family. The message was that they should move to Kyere. 
So they moved. There were five family members: his mother Tungtso Dr&ouml;lma, 
his sister Kalsang Dr&ouml;lma (who is my mother), his brother Damch&ouml; 
Tenphel Rinpoche, and his younger sister Tri-me Palmo. There was also a nun 
named Ani Palmo who came with them and lived with them at Kyere. She was 
related to both Trungpa's father and mother.</p>

 Lindy writes: <i>It was very late as you can see, 
in open country with only one house nearby, most likely theirs. They were 
tending their yak herd when we drove up in the late twilight.</i></p> 
<p>WF: Was the family safe in Kyere? </p>
<p>KSR: Yes, it wasn't dangerous because all of the Lha-thok people had such 
great faith in Trungpa Rinpoche. Because of that they protected Trungpa 
Rinpoche's mother and family very well.</p>
<p>WF: Were all the buildings at Kyere Gompa destroyed during the Cultural 
Revolution?</p>
<p>KSR: Yes, everything was destroyed. The Chinese destroyed everything. </p>
<p>WF: But your family was safe? </p>
<p>KSR: Yes, there wasn't any danger. Damch&ouml; Rinpoche was marked as a 
ngapda by the Chinese. A ngapda is a title and it means that you're a criminal. 
So, Damch&ouml; Rinpoche was marked as a ngapda because he was a lama, but the 
rest of the family was not.</p>
<p>WF: Was Damch&ouml; Rinpoche harmed in any way? </p>
<p>KSR: No, he was never harmed because of T&uuml;lku Drubgy&uuml;, who was 
Trungpa Rinpoche's regent or representative at Kyere Monastary. It was the 
previous Trungpa, the 10th Trungpa who placed him as his Regent.</p>
<p>WF: How did he keep Damch&ouml; Rinpoche safe? </p>
<p>KSR: T&uuml;lku Drubgy&uuml; took on the blame himself and spent 22 years 
in prison. So then there was no blame against Damch&ouml; Rinpoche.</p>
<p>WF: Did Rinpoche's mother have to hide her identity? </p>
<p>KSR: No. Everyone knew that she was Trungpa Rinpoche's mother. The Chinese 
knew. The people in the community said that even though the Chinese knew that 
she was Trungpa Rinpoche's mother, she hadn't committed any crime, so she was 
not to blame. She was innocent.</p>
<p>WF: I would like to know a bit more about Trungpa Rinpoche's mother, your 
grandmother. I understand that she was a practitioner and that she was a 
student of Khenpo Gangshar. I'm interested in knowing about her practice and 
what she was like.</p>
<p>KSR: Yes, yes. </p>
<p>WF: Did she have a chance to spend a lot of her later years in meditation 
or retreat?</p>
<p>KSR: It seems that she did practice but there were no retreats during that 
period of time. Reciting anything was against the Chinese law.</p>
<p>WF: So you had to do sadhana practice in private, quietly? </p>
<p>KSR: They could only practice in secret, without anyone seeing anything. 
The whole monastery was destroyed and all the ruins were given away. All of the 
things in the monastery, ritual objects, statues, and so on were distributed by 
the Chinese to the Lha-thok families&#151;maybe given to the poor families.</p>
<p>WF: In your own life at that time, did you have to hide the fact that you 
were a Rinpoche?</p>
<p>KSR: I didn't have the title of a Rinpoche. I was just a child.</p> 
<p>WF: You weren't discovered as a Tulku until later? </p> 
<p>KSR: Yes, it was later. I was recognized when I was about 13 or 14. </p> 
<p>WF: Who recognized you as a Tulku? </p> 
<p>KSR: First, Drupchen Karma Norbu. </p> 
<p>WF: Who is that? </p> 
<p><br>
 Drupchen Karma Norbu </p> <br>
<br>

<p>KSR: Karma Norbu was a pupil of the 10th Trungpa Rinpoche, and he was there 
with the 11th Trungpa Rinpoche at Tsawa G&ouml;n when Trungpa Rinpoche did the 
Rinchen Terzod empowerment. Karma Norbu was also the pupil of the second 
Jamg&ouml;n Kongtr&uuml;l, Situ Pema Wangchub (the 11th Situ), and Chenzig 
Chuju Lodro. He was like Jetsun Milerapa. He drank only a drop of water and a 
bit of food each day -- about that much (KSR holds up his thumb and index 
fingers half an inch apart.) He only wore a thin white cotton shawl or zen 
(outer monk's robe) and apart from that he was naked. He spent four years in 
retreat at Dorje Khyung Dzong in D&uuml;dtsi-til, then six years in Palpu 
retreat. After that, he went to U (Central Tibet) and Lhasa. There he was the 
retreat Lama at Tsurphu Monastery. He and Kalu Rinpoche were companions in 
retreat. Then, on his way to India, the 16th Karmapa Rigpe Dorje told Karma 
Norbu not to go. He told him to stay in Tibet and to take responsibility for 
recognizing all the Tulkus reborn in Kham.</p>
<p>WF: And he's the one who recognized you as a tulku? </p>
<p>KSR: Yes. </p>
<p>WF: Was he your lama? </p>
<p>KSR: Yes, my main lama was Karma Norbu, and I was also a student of Khenpo 
Karma Tseten, those two.</p>
<p>WF: Did you travel away from Kyere and D&uuml;dtsi-til at some point to 
study?</p>
<p>KSR: Yes, I've studied with Karma Norbu at Gyu-ne in Dege. </p>

<p>WF: Could you talk about the needs of the people in Kyere now? </p>
<p>KSR: These days, I have full responsibility for everything at Kyere Gompa. 
There's a main temple, which is probably about 24-25 khontris wide.5 </p>
<p>WF: Has it been rebuilt since the Chinese tore it down? </p>
<p>KSR: It's three stories high. It was rebuilt about twenty five years ago, 
but it still hasn't been built properly.</p>
<p>WF: What facilities are needed? </p>
<p>KSR: There's no electricity, so we need wood for fuel. The trees aren't 
very far away, but most people have to carry the wood on their backs or by yak.
</p>
<p>WF: What about medical facilities? </p>
<p>KSR: There's no hospital or clinic. If you need to go to a clinic, you have 
to walk or go by horse. If you go by horse, it takes one day. It's far.</p>
<p>WF: What about the clinic in D&uuml;dtsi-til? </p>
<p>KSR: Although there is one in D&uuml;dtsi-til you can't make it in a 
day&#151;not if you're traveling by horse. People don't have cars. There is a 
doctor in Kyere, but he doesn't have any medical facilities. There's a doctor, 
but no medicine.</p>
<p>WF: Is that a Tibetan doctor? </p>
<p>KSR: Yes, it's a Tibetan doctor. </p>
<p>WF: Do people in Kyere prefer to see a Tibetan doctor or a western doctor? 
</p>
<p>KSR: There are a lot of Tibetan doctors and these days many people are 
sick. There hasn't been any western medicine except for Chinese medicine. Some 
people have taken some Chinese medicine.</p>
<p>WF: If a clinic were to be built, should it be a modern medical clinic or 
would people prefer to have traditional Tibetan medicine?</p>
<p>KSR: We would need both Tibetan and Chinese medicine. 4 I do have a plan 
for building a medical clinic. There is a 500 khontris piece of land. It's an 
expansive area and it's centrally located. If we built a clinic there, it could 
provide care for 2,000 to 3,000 people. It would be greatly beneficial. There 
are a lot of people with severe headaches, other illnesses, etc. Many people 
can't reach a doctor and they die, particularly a lot of young children.</p>

Lindy King, summer 2005</p> 
<p>WF: What is your main priority? </p>
<p>KSR: The most important thing is the medical clinic. </p>
<p>WF: If the people here and in the west in general wanted to send money to 
you to help build this facility, how could they do that?</p>
<p>KSR: It is possible to send money to the clinic. There's a woman in San 
Francisco named Gaye Carlson.</p>
<p>WF: Is she raising money for the clinic? </p>
<p>KSR: Well, she sends money over. I built a nunnery with her donations and 
she continues to send money every year. She's been to the area where the 
nunnery was built and stayed five days. She gives at most about 24,000 Yuan a 
year [there are about eight Yuan to the US dollar]. At most she sends that much 
and sometimes it's less, around 5,000 to 6,000 Yuan. These funds are used for 
the nunnery.</p>
<p>WF: I'm going to publish this interview about Kyere Gompa and everything 
you've told me today on the Chronicles website. Would you like us to say that 
funding is needed for a medical facility in Kyere?</p>

Chronicles readers.</p> 
<p>Karma Senge was in Halifax for three weeks in June 2006 to attend the <i>
Blossoming of the Sun</i> wedding festival and to work with the <i>Nalanda 
Translation Committee</i>. While he was here, we were delighted to present him 
with $465 (the $482 minus paypal processing charges) donated by our readers, a 
very small step toward a medical clinic in Kyere.<br>
<br>
 Please see 
Interview with Karma Senge Rinpoche for more information on Kyere and CTR's 
family members who have lived there since 1959.</p> 
<p>Konchok Foundation<br>
Update</p> 
<p>In terms of ongoing support, the Konchok Foundation has agreed to accept 
tax deductible donations earmarked for Kyere. We have also been in touch with 
Gaye Carlson who has established a reliable way to send funds to Karma Senge in 
Kyere. Please visitWeyching Gompa for a look at the wonderful work that Gaye 
has undertaken.</p>
<p>_____________________</p> <br>
<br>

<p>KSR: That would be fine. </p>
<p>WF: I'll talk to Gaye. Should we send the money we raise to her?</p> 
<p>KSR: Yes, that's good. I think that would be really helpful. I myself don't 
have the wealth, but I have a very strong intention to help people by building 
this medical clinic. If I could build this clinic, it's like the generosity of 
giving life, saving lives. Thinking that, I acquired this land and have made 
plans to build a clinic there. So, when I go back to Kyere at the end of July, 
we'll get started on the work for the clinic.</p>
<p>WF: I understand that there are ten siblings altogether, including yourself 
and Sonam?</p>
<p>KSR: Yes, there are 10. </p>
<p>WF: Would it be proper to refer to you as the <i>Mukpos</i>? </p>
<p>KSR: Yes, Trungpa Rinpoche has given us title <i>Mukpo</i>. </p>
<p>WF: Could you list who those 10 siblings are? </p>
<p>KSR: I am the oldest, Karma Senge. Under me is</p> 
<p>a brother, Ati Rinpoche, who is a tulku of Drunglam Gompa, a big Karma 
Kamtsang monastery in Dege,</p> <br>

<p>a sister, Sonam Chokyi, who is married and lives near Jekundo,</p> <br>

<p>another sister, Gyume Chodron, who lives with her family near Kyere Gompa,
</p> <br>

<p>a sister, Tseyang Lhamo, who also lives with her family near Kyere Gompa,
</p> <br>

<p>a brother, who is married and lives with his family near Kyere Gompa,</p> 
<br> 
<p>another brother, Jangchub Chopel, who lives at Kyere Gompa with my father 
and is not married, nor is he a monk,</p> <br>

<p>a sister, Tinle Yongtsam, who is 30 years old and has a family,</p> <br>

<p>Sonam Wangdu, is a monk at Kyere Gompa. [Sonam is traveling with KSR as his 
attendant and is present during this interview.]</p> <br>

<p>and the youngest is Dechen, who is about 14 or 15 years old and is a monk 
at Kyere Gompa. When our mother died, Deche was about one year old. When he was 
four he started doing the nyengy&uuml; practice and he finished this year.</p> 
<br> <br>

<p>WF: Well, thank you very much for this interview Rinpoche. I think this 
will really help us to begin to connect more fully to the Mukpo family and the 
sangha in Kyere.</p>
