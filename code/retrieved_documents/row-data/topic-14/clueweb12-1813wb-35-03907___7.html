<h1>Medicine in Context 3 : Barefoot&nbsp;Doctors</h1> Posted on 18/11/2010 by 
Anne Amnesia (Blog Author) <br>

<p>It is with trepidation that I bring up the barefoot doctors of China. 
Created as part of the Rural Cooperative Medical System in China during the 
Cultural Revolution, the &ldquo;barefoot doctors&rdquo; were rapidly trained 
farmers and factory workers who served in their home communities as a sort of 
volunteer fire department of primary care. Their training included an intensive 
background in public health and sanitation, a stripped-down western-style 
pharmaceutical toolkit, acupuncture and herbs. Since the 1971 explosion of 
information in the US about &ldquo;traditional&rdquo; Chinese medicine, the 
barefoot doctors have been heavily romanticized by Westerners looking for a 
more friendly vision of what health care could be. With their short training 
period, autonomous practice and promiscuous embrace of<em>materiae medicae</em>
, the barefoot doctors appealed to the DIY counterculture in the US and Europe, 
indeed the blurb on the back of my translation ofA Barefoot Doctor&rsquo;s 
Manual is from the Whole Earth Catalogue review, and ends with the statement 
&ldquo;if I were a nurse on a commune, this would be my main source 
book.&rdquo; I find much fascinating in the barefoot doctors program, but for 
reasons that should soon be clear I do not endorse this idea.</p> 
<p><strong>&ldquo;Traditional&rdquo; Chinese Medicine</strong></p> 
<p>After winning the Chinese civil war, the new communist government inherited 
a country containing ten to twenty thousand doctors of western medicine, 
approximately 500,000 doctors of Chinese medicine, and a population of well 
over 500 million. Chinese medicine at the time was secretive and unpublished, 
often hereditary, and diagnoses and treatments varied widely between 
practitioners. There were few medical records and no oversight. Western-trained 
practitioners were few and urban. Markers of public health were poor, and the 
eyes of the world were on China.</p> 
<p>Mao had commanded that post-revolutionary China would be &ldquo;new,&rdquo; 
&ldquo;scientific,&rdquo; and &ldquo;unified&rdquo; and this had to include 
healthcare. During the war, researchers with the General Health Department of 
the People&rsquo;s Army had developed what would come to be called &ldquo;the 
New Acupuncture&rdquo; as a portable treatment modality appropriate for 
guerilla warfare. After the end of the war, one of these researchers, 
Western-trained Dr. Zhu Lian, published a textbook of her work in the army that 
did qualify as new and scientific. Academies throughout China began offering 
enrichment classes to doctors of Chinese medicine who wished to 
&ldquo;scientize&rdquo; and standardize their practice, although those who 
worked with the Ministry of Health were generally relegated to promoting 
hygiene, nutrition and immunizations. For a while, this compromise- hiring 
traditional practitioners, but only in peripherally medical capacities- seemed 
to work. To quote the book I&rsquo;m using as a source, here:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>Mao evidently saw the profession of Chinese medicine not so much as a 
therapeutic practice, but more as a large, and therefore significant, body of 
people. Mao&rsquo;s support of Chinese medicine during this time can be linked 
to a concern for adequate health care manpower, and by extrapolation, to a 
concern for social stability. If the Chinese medical practitioners were ignore 
and not forcibly, as it were, integrated into the new Communist society, and if 
their medicine was not encouraged, it would mean hundreds of thousands of 
people without any means of support. It is likely that Mao interpreted the more 
serious problem to be one of economics, and the importance of keeping people 
usefully employed within society, rather than the dangers of supporting a 
potentially ineffective medicine. (Taylor, K.Chinese Medicine in Communist 
China, 1945-63: A Medicine of Revolution. New York, Routledge. 2005.)</p> 
</blockquote> 
<p>Eventually, however, the gap had to be closed, and the early 1950&prime;s 
saw a series of disastrous attempts to regularize Chinese practitioners. 
Certification exams were instituted, and existing practitioners were eligible 
only for temporary certificates, and then only if they &ldquo;enjoyed good 
repute among the people.&rdquo; The new Beijing Chinese Medical Institute 
offered enrichment classes to Chinese practitioners in preventive medicine, New 
Acupuncture, and standardized Chinese prescriptions. Only 14,000 practitioners 
passed the new exams with scores of 50% in part one and 60% in part two (the 
minima for certification) and in some regions the fail rate was 90%. The new 
national health insurance did not cover Chinese medicine. The ministry of 
health came under attack for its policies, and in 1954 Mao dictated that 
&ldquo;scientizing&rdquo; Chinese medicine would not be sufficient to bring 
about his goal of a unified health care system. Instead, something rigorous 
would have to be re-created from the ground up.</p> 
<p>In 1955 or 1956, China established the first academies of the newly renamed 
&ldquo;Traditional Chinese Medicine.&rdquo; This single, unified system, taught 
academically, was to replace the variable undocumented oral traditions of 
earlier Chinese practice. At the head of the Beijing Research Academy was none 
other than New Acupuncture founder Zhu Lian.</p> 
<p>It is worth pointing out that the Korean war, which had just ended, had set 
communist China in full conflict with the capitalist west, and the first 
rumblings of the 1961 denunciation of the Soviet Union were straining the 
diplomacy between the world&rsquo;s two communist superpowers. China, the 
oldest bureaucracy on earth, had spent a humiliating century as a virtual trade 
colony, first to the English and Portugese, then to Japan. 
&ldquo;Patriotism&rdquo; in the Middle Kingdom required embracing a Chinese 
identity, not only in politics and national identity, but in the sciences and 
medicine as well. Here, China is following in the footsteps of the Soviet 
Union, which rejected &ldquo;bourgeois genetics&rdquo; in favor of Lysenkoism; 
in many ways the Chinese were lucky, since unlike Comrade Trofim&rsquo;s 
eternal punchline, Chinese medicine did actually have a multi-millenial history 
of empiric refinement. Traditional Chinese Medicine may not be traditional in 
its current form, but it is absolutely and irrevocably Chinese.</p> 
<p><strong>The Cultural Revolution and the RCMS</strong></p> 
<p>The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution was a period during which the CPC 
attempted to purge the entire nation of China, but especially the echelons of 
power, of the influence of &ldquo;liberal bourgeois elites.&rdquo; Often, this 
meant re-education or, often for doctors, compulsory service &ldquo;in the 
country&rdquo; but it also meant a lot of executions and- oddly- the emergence 
of the barefoot doctors.</p> 
<p>Beginning in the &ldquo;Great Leap Forward,&rdquo; productive life 
throughout China was reorganized into brigades and communes- entire communities 
focused on a single productive enterprise, be it a collective farm or a 
factory. Each brigade or factory lived, cooked, managed property, and received 
public services as a single unit, including food rations and, eventually, 
health care. The political ideology of the Cultural Revolution effectively 
prohibited educating a class of professional doctors, in the sense we think of 
them today. Doctors, after all, would be a privileged class of technocratic 
intellectuals, and would not be able to join with the peasants and workers. 
Furthermore, educating enough doctors to provide health care to all the newly 
reorganized collectives in China would have been a difficult task in the best 
of times, and these were not the best of times.</p> 
<p>The functional, and politically acceptable solution was to inaugurate a new 
training program for the &ldquo;peasants and workers&rdquo; themselves. 
Brigades and communes would be able to designate members who showed an academic 
aptitude as well as an acceptable political outlook to undergo a training that 
lasted as little as six months. The only formal educational requirement was a 
high school diploma. On completing their training, they would return to their 
home commune and continue to work in their previous capacity as a farmer or a 
factory worker. For up to half their working day, however, they could function 
as an unpretentious, unbourgeois primary care physician, albeit at the same 
hourly rate as the other half of their day. They weren&rsquo;t expected to go 
without shoes, but the term &ldquo;barefoot doctor&rdquo; came to represent 
this enforced humility.</p> 
<p><strong>But What Were They Like?</strong></p> 
<p>In evaluating the barefoot doctor program, one must always be mindful of 
the political circumstances that led to its creation, and the restriction these 
pressures have placed on evaluation and historiography. Our colloquial 
understanding of the program here in the west is grounded largely in 
romanticism and propaganda. The RCMS ended in 1981, and a brief pilot program 
to revive it in the early 90&prime;s focused more on the financial arrangements 
of insuring rural China than on the treatment modalities or the 
de-professionalization of the barefoot doctors. To a great degree, these two 
characteristics are up for significant debate.</p> 
<p>For instance, despite a formal intent to create proletarian health care, 
possibly 20% of barefoot doctors went on to become professional doctors of 
western medicine. China&rsquo;s current Minister of Health, a physician, began 
as a barefoot doctor. One imagines that many of the high school graduates who 
entered the program would have rather gone to medical school in the first 
place, but were unable to do so due to economic and political pressures of the 
time.</p> 
<p>Secondly, the contemporary claims made for the efficacy of TCM in health 
care are somewhat dubious. James Reston&rsquo;s famous article on how he had 
his appendix removed under acupuncture anesthesia started a revolution in the 
US- but in fact, his acupuncture was augmented with lidocaine and narcotic 
analgesics, something often not mentioned in secondary sources. Many articles 
have been written on a single photo taken of a woman undergoing heart surgery 
with only acupuncture anesthesia- and no ventilator. While alternative 
explanations have been proposed, the surgery as originally described would have 
compromised the intrapleural space and collapsed her lungs without 
positive-pressure ventilation.</p> 
<p>(You can read more on the subject here)</p> 
<p>I won&rsquo;t pretend to answer whether TCM &ldquo;works&rdquo; or not (see 
my last entry on why) but it is worth noticing that the Chinese government was 
willing, in the 1970&prime;s, to fudge data to convince the world that it did.
</p> 
<p>Accordingly, the Barefoot Doctor&rsquo;s Handbook should be read with a 
skeptical eye. There were, allegedly, multiple manuals appropriate for each 
province, focusing on more geographically appropriate treatments and 
conditions. The version translated into English, from Hunan, contains no 
information on mental health conditions, and no STDs. It is reasonable to 
assume that these existed, and it is reasonable to assume that barefoot doctors 
who had been issued penicillin (good then as now against syphillis) and 
chlorpromazine (listed in the manual as a &ldquo;tranquilizer&rdquo;) would 
probably have been familiar with these less decorous disorders. Furthermore, it 
is likely that separate regions, separate heirarchies, and even individual 
practitioners had their own prejudices about when to use the western, herbal, 
or acupuncture treatment modalities in the book. It is entirely possible that 
barefoot doctors used no herbs at all when western tour groups weren&rsquo;t 
watching. We can&rsquo;t know this, but we can&rsquo;t assume otherwise either.
</p> 
<p>A listing of the medications mentioned in the manual is also instructive, 
as is a comparison to the WHO&rsquo;sList of Essential Medicines. Many of the 
specific drugs have been replaced by safer or simpler drugs, but the overall 
balance between classes is largely the same.</p> 
<p>List of medications mentioned in the Barefoot Doctor&rsquo;s Manual</p> 
<p>What <em>is</em> interesting and undeniable about the barefoot doctors is 
that they were, ultimately, quickly and effectively trained, served without 
requiring enormous salaries, and were at least on some level closer in social 
status to their patients than doctors are in the US today. The same person who 
came to a barefoot doctor for antibiotics may have been wrestling bales of feed 
onto a truck with their doctor only hours earlier. The person in line at the 
kitchen telling jokes about the food might well be responsible for managing an 
epidemic of food-borne illness if the jokes turned out to be true. This is a 
level of social levelling I have experienced as a paramedic, and seen even with 
physicians in very small towns, but which is overall lacking in the US. In 
general, practitioners occupy a lofty social station from which they descend 
only to issue pronouncements about other people&rsquo;s bad habits, and 
occasionally to run for public office. If one&rsquo;s children go to the right 
sort of school, one might run into a doctor at a PTA ice cream social, but the 
economy depends on few of us going to that sort of school.</p> 
<p>Even in med school, I have been told by instructors never to show doubt or 
uncertainty, and to take control of a patient interaction with authority. To 
some extent this is what patients expect- its what they&rsquo;ve grown up with, 
after all- and to behave otherwise is to seem un-doctorly. However, it is also 
sometimes highly dishonest to act confident or authoritative, and even when 
physicians do have a degree of certainty- that smoking is bad e.g.- giving 
instructions from a position of authority seems much less pleasant to me than 
giving advice at eye level. Furthermore, many practitioners slide quickly into 
authoritarian interactions, or worse- insulated by money away from the social 
determinants of their patients&rsquo; diseases, they may come to think that 
their life represents a personal example that their slothful, slovenly patients 
should- must- follow. Everyone, not just nurses on communes or rural Chinese, 
can do a great deal better than that. This, ultimately for me, is the lesson of 
the barefoot doctors.</p>

<p>Living on the patient side of a undiagnosable condition, I can tell you 
that the practice of bluffing patients with certainty does them no favors. It 
only keeps them going to more doctors for answers. Or worse, locks them in a 
treatment regimen that is ineffective or potentially harmful. I&rsquo;ve had a 
dozen conflicting certainties.</p> Reply <br>

<p>I find the link you point out between false fronts of certainty and 
authoritarianism interesting. I noticed that in my position of Retail 
Associate, whenever I expressed anything other than total certainty, customers 
appeared uneasy. And these were fairly trivial matters compared to one&rsquo;s 
health. People in our society are socialized to expect definite answers, even 
though they so rarely are so definite. People in our society are also 
socialized to take orders and place orders. Perhaps to express doubt or 
uncertainty is to transgress the social order.</p> Reply <br>

<p>I agree with both comments above. I think most of us are socialized to 
expect definite answers and don&rsquo;t like not getting them. I also agree 
that doctors do us no favours appearing certain of the diagnosis when it is by 
no means certain. Life is complicated and so is technology, definitive answers 
are often too narrow to really be answers. But it goes against the grain to 
accept that, we like our answers in black and white not shades of gray.</p> 
<p>Doctors can choose to be reassuring parent-figures with all the answers to 
their patients/clients problems, or they can choose to be allies and expert 
resources for their patients/clients seeking solutions to their medical and 
health issues. Some patients prefer the parent-figure and some the ally, so it 
is not an easy choice.</p> 
<p>A blogger friend of mine recently wrote about the experience of having a 
doctor &ldquo;issue pronouncements about other people&rsquo;s bad 
habits,&rdquo; in her case, type 2 diabetes. She rebelliously chose to ignore 
his prescription for good health (i.e., changing her &ldquo;bad habits&rdquo;) 
until she noticed that she was losing her hair, her pride and joy. She read 
somewhere that hair loss was a symptom of diabetes and that made her far more 
motivated to do something about it than anything the doctor had said. If the 
good doctor had gotten down from the soapbox and actually discussed what such a 
diagnosis really meant for her personally, she might have taken it more 
seriously sooner.</p> 
<p>I enjoyed your livejournal blog, I look forward to reading more of your new 
blog. Good luck in your medical student career.</p> Reply <br>
