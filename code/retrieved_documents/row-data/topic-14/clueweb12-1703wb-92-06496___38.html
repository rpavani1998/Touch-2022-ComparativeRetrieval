<h1>Integrative Medicine Man</h1>  By Susan Brink  Photos by Jeff Miller 
<p>Dr. David Rakel</p> 
<p>The hiccups wouldn&rsquo;t stop. It was August of 1996, and an elderly 
stroke victim lay dying in his home in the small town of Driggs, Idaho. But he 
could have no rest. He was stricken with a relentless case of hiccups, robbing 
him of comfort.</p> 
<p>The episode gave David Rakel, the man&rsquo;s physician and neighbor, a 
memorable lesson in the importance of watching, listening, and heeding the 
desires of his patients. Drugs, the main weapon in Rakel&rsquo;s medical 
arsenal, made the dying man groggy and unaware, and still the hiccups 
continued. Family members suggested acupuncture.</p> 
<p>Like many conventional, or allopathic, Western physicians, Rakel was 
skeptical. But he figured acupuncture would do no harm. &ldquo;I humored them. 
I said, &lsquo;Sure. Why not?&rsquo; &rdquo; It worked. The acupuncturist came. 
The hiccups went away without sedation. &ldquo;He was able to die with loving 
family around him and a sense of peace. It was a beautiful death,&rdquo; says 
Rakel, now a UW-Madison professor of family medicine. &ldquo;If I had given him 
more drugs, he would have been lethargic. He would not have been present with 
his loved ones.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>The incident started Rakel on a path that would lead to his founding the 
university&rsquo;s integrative medicine program in 2001.</p> 
<p>That journey to the Midwest began in Driggs, nestled between the Tetons and 
the Big Hole Mountains and just over the pass from Jackson Hole, Wyoming, where 
he first hung out his shingle as a rural family practice physician. It was 
there that he began to shed his skepticism about acupuncture, herbal 
supplements, guided imagery, and a host of healing techniques that he believes 
medicine can add seamlessly to the mix of traditional Western options.</p> 
<p>David Rakel started the Integrative Medicine Research Park Clinic, which 
offers services such as meditation classes for stress reduction. Since arriving 
on campus, Rakel has taught a variety of integrative medicine techniques to 
both students and fellow physicians.</p> 
<h3>The Soul of Medicine</h3> 
<p>In 1999, Rakel decided to learn as much as he could about integrative 
medicine. He left Idaho for a two-year fellowship at theUniversity of Arizona 
in Tucson. There, surrounded by desert peace and beauty and influenced by a 
steady stream of superstars in the field of healing arts and science, he took 
lessons in the heart, soul, art, and spirit of medicine.</p> 
<p>His calling was to bring those lessons back to the broader world of 
American health care and help integrate them with the best that conventional 
medicine has to offer. He spent those fellowship years learning how integrative 
medicine rests on four pillars of health promotion: social, psychological, 
physical, and environmental.</p> 
<p>Once considered on the fringes of health science, integrative medicine has 
gotten a boost from technology such as functional magnetic resonance imaging, 
which shows pathways between mind and body, and from research that backs up 
connections between nutrition, physical activity, and good health.</p> 
<p>It&rsquo;s been a decade since Rakel&rsquo;s training at the Arizona Center 
for Integrative Medicine, and he&rsquo;s just been approved for tenure at the 
UW. For John Frey, professor in theDepartment of Family Medicine and the man 
who hired Rakel in 2001, Rakel&rsquo;s interest in integrative medicine has 
been a bonus. &ldquo;What attracted me about him was that he&rsquo;s a talented 
doctor with a wonderful perspective on patient and family care,&rdquo; says 
Frey. &ldquo;The integrative medicine program was something I didn&rsquo;t know 
much about.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Frey was key to getting Rakel to come to Wisconsin. But so was an 
unconventional decision-making method. Following his fellowship, Rakel weighed 
teaching offers in Colorado and Wisconsin. Torn by what he saw as two excellent 
options, he turned to guided imagery. In his mind, he went flying on the wings 
of an eagle.</p> 
<p>Based on the concept that the body and mind are connected, guided imagery 
is a way of employing all the senses to help steer imagination. The body can 
respond as though what&rsquo;s being imagined is a real event. A classic 
example is to imagine a lemon &mdash; think of peeling it, smelling it, 
squirting it in your mouth. Do your lips purse up in response?</p> 
<p>In medicine, guided imagery can be used to control pain and stress. Cancer 
patients, for example, may be encouraged to imagine tiny healthy cells 
overpowering destructive cancer cells in their bodies. While the American 
Cancer Society says there&rsquo;s no proof that guided imagery influences the 
progress of cancer, the ACS Web site does cite evidence that the technique can 
reduce stress, anxiety, and pain and lessen some of the side effects of 
chemotherapy, such as nausea and vomiting.</p> 
<p>As Rakel imagined a golden eagle, he says, &ldquo;he picked me up by the 
collar and we went flying.&rdquo; And knowing how that must sound, Rakel 
hurriedly assures with a laugh: &ldquo;No hallucinogens. All with our own 
bodies. I looked down and there were lakes and oak trees.&rdquo; No snow-topped 
mountains. No aspens. He was looking down at the lakes and forests of the upper 
Midwest, not at the Rocky Mountains. &ldquo;So we came to Wisconsin,&rdquo; he 
says.</p> 
<p>Another service offered by the integrative medicine clinics is acupuncture, 
which is designed to stimulate the natural healing processes of the body and is 
used to treat problems such as stress, nausea, pain, and other conditions.</p> 
<h3>Mentoring Students and Patients</h3> 
<p>At the UW, Rakel began teaching integrative medicine techniques to 
students, as well as fellow physicians. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s been able to attract 
a substantial number of young clinicians who agree there are a variety of 
different approaches to care,&rdquo; says Frey. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s developed a 
very talented group of young family doctors, and was instrumental in getting a 
fellowship program going.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>In 2002, Luke Fortney &rsquo;98, MD&rsquo;03, now an assistant professor in 
the family medicine program, was the first of Rakel&rsquo;s students in a 
month-long elective rotation in integrative medicine. &ldquo;Dr. Rakel has been 
a mentor from that point forward,&rdquo; Fortney says. In addition to editing 
the field&rsquo;s key textbook,Integrative Medicine, Rakel&rsquo;s work today 
centers on teaching and caring for patients at the Integrative Medicine Odana 
Atrium Clinic on Madison&rsquo;s west side and the Integrative Medicine 
Research Park Clinic. He also started the integrative medicine clinic at the 
Comprehensive Cancer Center at the UW Hospital.</p> 
<p>Each facility offers therapies such as massage and acupuncture; the 
Research Park clinic also provides health psychology, Feldenkrais (movement 
therapy), healing touch, mindfulness stress reduction, yoga, and tai chi.</p> 
<p>Patients are taught to meditate to reduce stress and encouraged to eat a 
diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts, soy, olive oil, cold-water 
fish, and dark-colored berries for heart health. Part of their prescription for 
good health will surely be to exercise and get moderate sunshine to reduce 
depression. They might be told to try acupuncture for arthritis pain. And their 
spiritual beliefs will be considered as individual health plans are developed. 
Often, patients who come to the clinics are facing difficult chronic diseases 
and complicated tangles of symptoms.</p> 
<p>For Lynette Peterson, Rakel has been a lifesaver. Now sixty-five, she has 
had multiple sclerosis, a disease that attacks the central nervous system, for 
thirty-five years. Symptoms can be mild or increasingly severe, but there is no 
cure. She found Rakel after her physician prescribed a chemotherapy regimen 
that left her with hair loss, sores on her lips and tongue, and loss of control 
of her bladder and bowels. &ldquo;I told him I couldn&rsquo;t take any more 
chemotherapy.</p> 
<p>It was killing me,&rdquo; she says. Rakel steered Peterson to acupuncture, 
changed some of her prescription medications, added dietary suggestions, and 
encouraged the use of fish oil, herbs, and regular exercise. It has taken more 
than a year, and hasn&rsquo;t been a miraculous cure for Peterson, who remains 
in a wheelchair. But her symptoms have stabilized. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s got such a 
positive approach,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;He knows he can&rsquo;t cure 
everybody. But he also knows there are things he can do to make their lives 
easier.&rdquo; She swims twice a week, remembering his advice: &lsquo;Keep 
exercising, keep swimming. Think positive, think positive.&rsquo; &rdquo;</p> 
<p>But changing an American&rsquo;s lifestyle is difficult. Rakel is 
realistic, seeing change as a highly individual endeavor. A lifestyle 
prescription must, he has written, &ldquo;be individualized based on the 
health, energy, resources, and personality of the patient.&rdquo; &ldquo;We 
really spend a lot of time listening,&rdquo; Fortney says of those who practice 
integrative medicine. They listen for clues about what in patients&rsquo; lives 
might be contributing to ailments such as restless leg, acid reflux, or chronic 
pain, as well as what they might be willing to do to make changes.</p> 
<p>Conventional medicine is part of integrated medicine. In fact, Frey says, 
without that mix, integrative medicine would get no respect. &ldquo;If it 
becomes part of what doctors do in primary care, working with different healers 
as a team, then I think it has an important role,&rdquo; says Frey.</p> 
<p>Patients in integrative medicine, like any primary care patients, get flu 
shots, blood-pressure medications, or recommendations for surgery when their 
health calls for allopathic medicine. &ldquo;I have no hesitation to use 
drugs,&rdquo; Rakel says. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re often indicated and 
beneficial.&rdquo; But all the while, patients are encouraged to look beyond a 
quick prescription-pad solution for what ails them, and to take as much control 
as they can over their well-being.</p> 
<p>Massage therapists treat conditions such as back and neck pain, headaches, 
sports injuries, and stress. According to a clinic brochure, the staff focuses 
on less invasive therapies such as massage &ldquo;to help remove barriers that 
may be blocking the body&rsquo;s ability to heal.&rdquo;</p> 
<h3>Ups and Downs</h3> 
<p>With fundamental changes to the nation&rsquo;s health care delivery system 
recently passed into law, integrative medicine may well get increased 
attention. And it should, according to an article that Rakel co-authored with 
Wayne Jonas in a 2009 issue ofAlternative Therapies.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;If the health reformers are looking to get the biggest &lsquo;bang 
for their buck&rsquo; both in the prevention and management of chronic 
disease,&rdquo; they wrote, &ldquo;they need look no further than delivering 
[integrative medicine&rsquo;s] four pillars [of social, psychological, 
physical, and environmental health].&rdquo;</p> 
<p>It&rsquo;s not certain how integrative medicine will fare under the newly 
passed health reform law. But, according to theIntegrated Health Care Policy 
Consortium, a coalition of conventional, alternative, and complementary health 
professionals, there are some positive signs. They include an emphasis on 
prevention, and on standards of evidence that will allow alternative therapies 
to be evaluated head-to-head with conventional therapies.</p> 
<p>The hope is that as scientific studies find alternative therapies to be 
beneficial, insurers will cover them, just as they do a proven blood-pressure 
medication or an effective surgical procedure. Rakel says this doesn&rsquo;t 
necessarily pan out, however, as there is now &ldquo;good evidence for 
acupuncture,&rdquo; and very few insurers cover it.</p> 
<p>The discipline has had its ups and downs since Rakel&rsquo;s training in 
integrative medicine began in Tucson. He was one of four fellows to study with 
Andrew Weil, a pioneer in a field that has changed names a few times as it has 
slowly earned grudging respect. The label alternative medicine has morphed into 
integrative medicine, via the terms &ldquo;complementary&rdquo; and 
&ldquo;holistic.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>But by any other name, it means health care as opposed to disease care, an 
emphasis on wellness even as it deals with illness. And it is based on the same 
rigorous standards of evidence as any branch of medicine. &ldquo;This is not 
belief without substance,&rdquo; says Frey. &ldquo;[Integrative medicine is] 
dedicated to pursuing the science behind [the discipline].&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Its practitioners are schooled in ways to hold on to their hearts and souls 
even as they master the intricacies of anatomy, physiology, biology, and 
psychology. They see their work as healing the whole patient, rather than being 
limited to specific body parts. When integrative medicine is hot, the universe 
responds with initiatives such as an office within the National Institutes of 
Health. When it&rsquo;s not, funds are cut. &ldquo;In my career, it&rsquo;s 
gone up and down about three times,&rdquo; says Rakel. &ldquo;The financial 
incentives [that focus on rewarding the treatment of disease] always swing 
against it.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Even as acceptance grows, there are setbacks. In 2009, physician Lucille 
Marchand saw her integrative medicine work at the UW oncology clinic go from 
full time to one day a week because of a funding reduction from the hospital. 
Fortunately, the Department of Family Medicine stepped in, providing resources 
to continue her work. The care she provides involves listening and talking, not 
performing high-income-yielding procedures. &ldquo;Hospitals see integrative 
medicine as less necessary. If they&rsquo;re going to survive, they feel they 
need to maximize interventions,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;One oncologist said he 
didn&rsquo;t believe in integrative medicine. Luckily, most oncologists and 
other cancer health professionals see the benefit.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Rakel confirms that &ldquo;the UW Hospital has been supportive of our 
program&rdquo; and that an interdisciplinary UW Hospital Health and Healing 
Committee was started a few years ago for just that purpose. The American 
health care system, however, has always rewarded physicians skilled in invasive 
procedures more than those who listen to patients and talk them through 
healing. A heart surgeon, for example, earns an average of $515,000 a year, 
according to an Allied Physicians salary survey, while a family practice 
physician averages $135,000.</p> 
<p>And primary care physicians, forced by the health care delivery system to 
spend as little as fifteen or twenty minutes with a patient, don&rsquo;t have 
the time they need to get to the core of symptoms or to really influence the 
course of a chronic disease. The way payment incentives are set up through 
America&rsquo;s insurance systems, a physician earns more for seeing four 
patients in an hour than for spending an entire hour with one patient. 
&ldquo;[Practitioners] get good at seeing people quickly by just treating 
symptoms,&rdquo; Rakel says. &ldquo;If someone comes in with upper gastric 
pain, I can turn that off with Prilosec, and the patient leaves happy. But we 
miss out on what that symptom is trying to teach us, what it is that might be 
eating [the patient] up inside.&rdquo;</p> 
<h3>An Ounce of Prevention</h3> 
<p>Contemporary American medicine focuses on diagnosis and treatment of 
existing disease. &ldquo;We have a wonderful disease care system,&rdquo; Rakel 
says. &ldquo;We can reverse acute episodes of disease. But we haven&rsquo;t 
paid enough attention to helping people avoid disease.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Rakel is a staunch advocate for moving prevention and wellness from an 
afterthought to the core mission of health care. Study after study shows that 
he is on to something. In January 2010, theNew England Journal of Medicine 
found compelling evidence that reducing salt intake would save lives and money.
</p> 
<p>A public health intervention designed to reduce salt consumption by 1,200 
milligrams &mdash; or about two-thirds of a teaspoon &mdash; a day, could 
nearly cut in half the number of new cases of heart disease, stroke, and heart 
attack. In the process, it could save between $10 billion and $24 billion a 
year in health care costs. &ldquo;This is a good example of how a low-cost 
intervention can result in dramatic effects on human health,&rdquo; Rakel says.
</p> 
<p>But making it work for millions of people is profoundly difficult. 
&ldquo;To understand how to implement a low-salt program, we have to understand 
how complex systems interact. We need to communicate a common goal to the food 
industry, school lunch programs, marketing personnel,&rdquo; Rakel says. 
&ldquo;We need to create financial incentives to make these changes. No one 
makes money by reducing salt in the diet.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Like many lifestyle changes, reducing salt intake is so much easier said 
than done. A 2005 study in theArchives of Internal Medicine examined the top 
five health-producing behaviors: not smoking, getting adequate exercise, eating 
a healthy diet, managing stress, and using early disease detection tools such 
as mammograms and colonoscopies. The study found that only 2 to 4 percent of 
Americans engage in all of them.</p> 
<p>Helping people change unhealthy lifestyles requires an investment in health 
care teams that will stand by patients as they try to change. Rakel is now 
working on just such an initiative to create patient-centered units &mdash; 
being recognized nationally in primary care as &ldquo;medical homes&rdquo; 
&mdash; that are composed of teams of treatment professionals. Generally these 
teams consist of doctors and nurses, but Rakel would also like to include 
nutritionists, exercise physiologists, health psychologists, social workers, 
and even spiritual guides working with individuals to help them stay healthy on 
their own terms. While a physician may lead the medical team, the workload is 
shared among various professionals, and the patient ends up getting more time 
devoted to health education, disease prevention, and chronic disease control.
</p> 
<p>The goal is to shift the health care system from its emphasis on reacting 
to a symptom or disease toward being more proactive. Rather than waiting for a 
person to develop diabetes, for example, and then rushing in with kidney 
dialysis or surgery for failing kidneys or limbs, Rakel hopes that developing 
these health teams will help with prevention. &ldquo;These lessons are hard to 
learn,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;But what if we had whole teams of professionals 
to help make those [lifestyle] changes? We need our health and political 
leadership to stress the importance of this.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>He continues to go back to lessons learned from the folks in the small 
Western town of Driggs, Idaho, with its 1,300 people and its fourteen-bed 
hospital. In a town that small, a doctor doesn&rsquo;t wait until people come 
into the office to make observations about their well-being. &ldquo;You see 
your patients at the grocery store and in church,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;You 
develop insights into why they might be coming to see you with headaches.&rdquo;
</p> 
<p>His initial skepticism has turned to enthusiasm, and then evolved into a 
true passion for practicing and teaching as one of the nation&rsquo;s leaders 
in integrative medicine. Rakel knows that not everyone will buy the whole 
package, which could include flying with an imaginary golden eagle to help nail 
down a difficult decision. But offering options such as guided imagery, 
acupuncture, nutrition education, and lifestyle advice along with conventional 
medical options can help.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got to read your audience,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;meet 
them where they&rsquo;re at, and maybe bring them to a new place of 
awareness.&rdquo;Susan Brink is a freelance health writer based in Chicago. She

<p>I have been a nurse(LPN)for the past 2 and 1/2 years at a clinic in St. 
Croix Falls WI. My desire to get into health care was prompted by my interest 
in alternative medicine. Understanding that there are not a lot of jobs in this 
field I turned to traditional medicine. Years prior to becoming a nurse I read 
and did research on a lot of diseases and how people have used alternative 
treatments to overcome their ailment. The main thing that I have learned is 
that anything is possible, and the power of the mind is incredible. It is the 
seat to the immune system and a healthy immune system is the cornerstone to all 
healing.</p> 
<p>I recently approaced the CEO of this organization to see if he would be 
interested in starting an integrated medicine progam here. Not sure what would 
be needed to start other than my desire to truely help others. If you could 
give me some ideas as to how to get started in this field I would appreciate 
it. I also understand that I would need to get a doctor to oversee this venture 
as I am a LPN.</p>

<p>For shame, Wisconsin. You have made me embarrassed to be a UW alumnus.</p> 
<p>There is no evidence to support the various treatments identified here, 
like acupuncture and healing touch, as offering anything beyond placebo. I 
honestly cannot understand how a serious institution like the UW can offer 
treatments that lack any scientific basis.</p> 
<p>There is no such thing as &ldquo;alternative&rdquo; medicine. Medicine is a 
science. Its claims must therefore be supported by evidence, not anecdote. If 
someone has a theory about a course of treatment, it is subject to testing. If 
the tests prove that it works, and are replicated, this course of treatment 
becomes &ldquo;medicine&rdquo; (which is the same thing as &ldquo;conventional 
medicine&rdquo;).</p> 
<p>For example, there is nothing &ldquo;alternative&rdquo; about the claim 
that there is a link between nutrition and physical activity, on the one hand, 
and good health. There is evidence to support these claims, and this evidence 
has been replicated in a number of tests. This claim should not be compared to 
claims that therapies like acupuncture and massage help &ldquo;remove 
barriers&rdquo; that &ldquo;may be blocking the body&rsquo;s ability to 
heal&rdquo;. There is no evidence to support this.</p> 
<p>Moreover, by linking such a program to a normally well-respected 
institution, you give credence to the claim that these treatments are a valid 
alternative to so-called conventional medicine. They are not. People have died, 
and will continue to die, by opting for &ldquo;alternative&rdquo; approaches 
instead of real medicine.</p>

and cancel this program.</p>  &mdash; Tim <br>

<p>Tim,</p> 
<p> You have lost focus for the goal of medicine, it is to cure the patients 
of their ailments regardless of the drug, or technique, science based or 
anecdotal. I am all for whatever methods can provide relief for those who are 
suffering, regardless how &ldquo;scientific&rdquo; the approach.</p>

<p>The problem with alternative medicine is it drives people who are ignorant 
into the arms of those who will take their money and give them nothing in 
return. Instead of receiving treatments that could save their lives they may 
just die. All this is doing is exploiting the placebo effect.</p>  &mdash;

<p>Unfortunately, this article has some definitional issues and conceptual 
leaps that don&rsquo;t make this important and necessary conversation any 
easier. Alternative, complementary, and integrative medicine are not synonymous 
but represent different stages along the evolutionary continuum described here. 
&ldquo;Allopathic&rdquo; medicine was a label originated by homeopaths to 
describe their philosophical opponents, but is not really a synonym for 
orthodox medicine, nor is &ldquo;Western&rdquo; medicine (homeopathy, for 
example, was promulgated by a German). Statements like &ldquo;There is now 
&lsquo;good evidence for acupuncture&rsquo;&rdquo; are insufficiently detailed 
&mdash; would we accept a conventionally oriented physician&rsquo;s statement 
that &ldquo;There is good evidence for surgery?&rdquo; Good evidence for 
surgery doing what, exactly? Yes, there is good evidence for some things and 
not for others. I&rsquo;m in favor of increased access to evidence-based 
information about these therapies, because it will let patients make informed 
decisions. The Cochrane Library, available remotely to people affiliated with 
the UW, is a good place to start. Check it out athttp://ebling.library.wisc.edu/

<p>I find it strange and quite sad that part of what makes this 
&ldquo;alternative&rdquo; practice&rsquo;s approach successful is that the 
doctors spend enough time with their patients to understand their concerns and 
start to consider the etiology as well as the symptoms. I hope that one day our 
health care system will have evolved to a point where doctors being able to 
give their patients sufficient time and consideration to help them promote 
their own short-term and long-term health is not the alternative, it is the 
norm.</p>  &mdash; Hollis Moore <br>

<p>I would like to speak only on Acupuncture. The fact remains, whether people 
&ldquo;believe in it&rdquo; or not, that more people have been treated with 
acupuncture over 5000 years than with any other form of medicine. It is not 
&ldquo;extinct&rdquo; medicine but is still continuing to help individuals all 
over the world.</p> 
<p>It is &ldquo;real medicine&rdquo;.</p> 
<p>In the United States, Acupuncture is state-licensed, regulated mostly by 
medical boards (yes, &ldquo;orthodox&rdquo; medical boards) and supervised by 
state acupuncture advisory committees, comprised of both licensed 
acupuncturists and physicians. (I hold acupuncture licenses in three states and 
have facilitated licensing in the fourth).</p> 
<p>Acupuncture and Asian Medicine is now, additionally, taught at many 
well-respected medical schools across this country to enrich their 
&ldquo;orthodox&rdquo; medical education.</p> 
<p>The goal here is not &ldquo;either/or&rdquo;. The goal is integrating 
different modalities to help patients to heal. The idea is to be as resourceful 
as possible to offer a comprehensive program for patients.</p> 
<p>If you hold that acupuncture is not a form of medicine complementary to 
&ldquo;real/conventional/orthodox medicine&rdquo;, then perhaps you might 
update yourself on the &ldquo;evolutionary continuum&rdquo;.</p> 
<p>For myself, I would be honored to work in this exciting and integrative 
program.</p>  &mdash; Leslie <br>

<p>I spent twenty years seeing &ldquo;real/conventional/orthodox&rdquo; 
medicine specialists and none of them could identify the problem and instead 
only tried to treat the many symptoms. One visit with Dr. Rakel was all it 
took. No medication no extra visits needed. A drastic change in diet has 
greatly improved my condition. Thank you Dr. Rakel you are an extremely 
knowledgeable and very compassionate doctor. Thank you for looking at the whole 
picture and identifying the problem rather than treating symptoms.<br>

<p>No, acupuncture is not &ldquo;real medicine&rdquo; &ndash; it is not based 
in science. We haven&rsquo;t got a scrap of evidence supporting theories of 
meridians or chi. Like Dr. Walshen, I&rsquo;m all for anything that relieves 
suffering, whether &ldquo;scientific&rdquo; or not, but please, let&rsquo;s 
have physicians practicing science-based medicine and leave the rest to the 
mystics and gurus.</p>  &mdash; Steve <br>

<p>Tim&rsquo;s comment sums this up pretty well. I was shocked and a bit 
disappointed to see this on the front page. There is a clear line between real 
medicine and fake medicine, and fuzzing the boundary is neither ethical nor 
efficient.</p> 
<p>Let&rsquo;s start with acupuncture. First of all, it does not work. 
Numerous studies (placebo controlled by the way, not &ldquo;he poked me and my 
hiccups went away! Magic!&rdquo;) have concluded that the location of the 
puncture, the type of needle, and just about every other medically relevant 
aspect of acupuncture treatment makes no difference in outcomes. What does make 
a difference? What the patient is being told will happen, what the setting is 
like, who the doctor is, etc. In other words, its all psychological. There 
isn&rsquo;t even any controversy over this except on the fringes of the medical 
profession, unlike over other CAM treatments such as meditation and guided 
visualization, the efficacy of which have not been established.</p> 
<p>Furthermore, the very basis of acupuncture, meridians of energy running 
through the body, simply has no evidential basis and makes no sense given our 
knowledge of biology and the universe in general. There is legitimate knowledge 
left to be gained about medicine, and some of it will come from the alternative 
medicine community. But we&rsquo;re not going to find it by playing fast and 
loose with science and believing what feels right to use instead of subject our 
beliefs the close and rigorous scrutiny.</p>  &mdash; Will <br>

<p>Tim,</p> 
<p>Have you read Dr. Rakel&rsquo;s books? His work is based on solid evidence. 
Plenty of double blind studies referenced in his books support the therapies he 
discusses. Do your homework. Don&rsquo;t stay stuck in narrow orthodoxy.</p>

<p>Met Dr. Rakel once for my chronic back pain and found him actually 
interested in me as a person. We spoke for a while and he made some suggestions 
in changing the patterns he thought were causing my back pain. I followed his 
advice and though I will never be totally pain free, I am now off pain meds 
that I took for over five years. I consider him a kind man that gently guides 
you to help yourself.</p> 
<p>The one problem with the strictly scientific approach to healing is that it 
often leaves out the whole person. Alternative medicine is another tool in the 
tool kit. For some it will work, for some it will not. For me, it has helped 
where pure science failed.</p> 
<p>Dr. Rakel, let me know if you ever open up for new patients, I will be the 
first in line.</p>  &mdash; Dan <br>

<p>Your conversion to &ldquo;integrative medicine&rdquo; was inevitable as it 
is for anyone in a medical discipline IF they are open to looking beyond the 
drug-based disease model of medicine to a preventative health maintenance 
model. The integrative approach could be so much more cost-effective, BUT would 
not rake in the billions of dollars to insurance stockholders who often spend 
less than 20% of their premium intake for the care of those who pay the 
premiums. I encourage you to also look at Music Therapy as it is based on very 
sound scientific data, now increasingly focused on the effects of music on 
brain functions, and is used very effectively in obstetrics, oncology, surgery, 
hemodialysis, pediatrics, neurology, immunology, psychiatry, and for treating 
autism, aphasia, dementia, and a wide variety of developmental disabilities.</p>

<p>I am very pleased to see this article in On Wisconsin. It shows how 
insightful and forward thinking the UW continues to be. Integrative medicine is 
very important, vital to the future of Health care in the US.<br>
 According to 
the World Health Organization, the United States ranks 37th in overall health.
</p> 
<p>http://www.photius.com/rankings/healthranks.html</p> 
<p>In the US, we excel in Acute care, we have the best technology and 
resources at our finger tips, yet we have embarrassing long term and infant 
mortality statistics.</p> 
<p>Our doctors are trained to depend on lab and diagnostic tests, which are 
not good for early detection. We don&rsquo;t diagnose cancer until it&rsquo;s 
large enough for surgery, chemo or radiation.<br>
 Our medical system is 
designed to profit when we are ill. (think about it).</p> 
<p>We treat nearly everything with a chemical or surgery. We are losing sight 
of the Art of Medicine. As Americans, we can no longer afford to not 
investigate Alternative, Complementary, or Integrative medicine.<br>
 As 
Americans we need to look at the long term consequences of our behaviors, and 
we need a health care system that truly teaches us signs and symptoms of the 
beginnings of ill health so we can stop the progression of disease and 
debility. We need drugs to treat the acute problem and simultaneously the 
information on how to treat the cause of the dysfunction.<br>
 I have been a 
practicing RN for 24 years. Weekly, my patients tell me, &ldquo;my tests came 
out fine, and everyone tells me I&rsquo;m doing well,so why do I feel so 
bad?&rdquo;<br>
 Most of my patients are taking between 15 and 30 Pills a day.
<br> I love being a nurse, but it is sickening me that in our society we 
diagnose people with chronic diseases, tell them they will be on drugs for the 
rest of their lives, and watch them slowly die for the next 5-15 years 
believing there is no cure. This is not good medicine. The most difficult part 
for me, is knowing that chronic diseases are increasing, and they are occuring 
earlier in our lifespan. Life expectancy is starting to decline.</p> 
<p>The good news, is that there is a lot that can be done for the future of 
Health Care and Dr. Rakel is part of the Answer.</p>

<p>I personally am all in favor of any medicine that carries no negative side 
effects. Especially if it is all natural. But one thing I disagree with Dr. 
Rakel is that I&rsquo;m not very much into imagery medicine. I think that with 
medicine it is important to focus on the body, the organs, the overall energy, 
the posture, nutrition, knowledge, that kind of stuff. I even read that british 
MD&rsquo;s in the 1920s visually confirmed the existence of hairlike 
mini-nerves in the exact same places that the chinese have theorized the 
meridians to be. Think about that the next time you are considering going under 
the knife! If meridians are real, then surgery is a very bad idea and should be 
avoided at all costs. Act early, heal better. And I don&rsquo;t need to go into 
detail about what everybody already knows: most pharmaceutical drugs are 
actually worse than placebos.</p> 
<p>On a personal note, I must say that I was fortunate enough to get to see 
Dr. Rakel when I was an undergraduate, and discuss some very challenging 
chronic disease diagnoses I had been dealing with already for over ten years. 
Needless to say he inspired me greatly.</p> 
<p>Bravo Dr. David Rakel, and bravo to the University of Wisconsin for 
recognizing the salience of non-invasive and non-damaging therapeutics.</p>

<p>Tim is right.<br>
 Why should people touch each other or peacefully 
meditate to keep from becoming too stressed when they could just take drugs to 
make them feel better? Besides, if people didn&rsquo;t need to buy as many 
drugs, it would really be unfortunate for pharmaceutical companies, and of 
course the economy at large.</p> 
<p>We cannot let these &ldquo;alternatives&rdquo; threaten us. We must stay 
strong and resist all that is unfamiliar. We need more evidence to show that 
human touch is a good thing. I prefer not to be touched at all, and I am still 
alive. Why can&rsquo;t people be normal and just take a bunch of drugs?</p>  
&mdash;Mark <br>

<p>I think it is ignorant to simply discredit &ldquo;alternative&rdquo; 
practices just because the science behind them has not been proven yet. Just 
because we cannot scientifically explain why something such as acupuncture 
works, does not mean that there is not a scientific process behind it. We are 
far from understanding all of the intricacies of the human body and its healing 
processes. It is silly to say that just because something cannot be explained 
it is not worthwhile treatment.<br>
 Personally, I have dealt with on ongoing 
illness for the past 8 years and have been to upwards of 7 different 
specialists and been on 10 different medications that have come with scores of 
different side effects, some of which were so severe that they put my life on 
hold completely. This is not answer to curing a disease. These medications and 
treatments focused on a singular part of my health and instead of working with 
my body to heal itself they were in a constant battle with what my body was 
naturally trying to do. I think one of the biggest benefits of many alternative 
treatments is the fact that they work with your body and the natural processes 
that are already taking place. Its not a battle between synthetically produced 
reactions and natural processes but rather inducing natural processes that your 
body needs to heal itself.</p> 
<p>How can this not be the better option for patients? I am a proponent of 
&ldquo;orthodox&rdquo; treatments when they are needed but if alternative 
practices are offering less invasive and harsh options that can solve a 
patient&rsquo;s needs, why not? Even if we cannot explain why it works.</p> 
<p>As for my own illness, it has practically vanished in a matter of 3 months 
since beginning treatment with an acupuncturist. As a med student I cannot 
explain to you why this treatment has worked but I can certainly attest to its 
effectiveness, and I cannot ignore the life changing benefits it has had for me.

<p>Bravo to Dr. Rakel for practicing in, and trying to enlighten, such a 
conservative (and in some cases ignorant) area of the country.</p> 
<p>I&rsquo;m sure he will help many patients &mdash; who would otherwise be 
doomed to &ldquo;medicine as usual&rdquo; these days. By this I mean being 
rushed through their appointment times, dutifully drugged as most of us are 
taught from first year of medical school on, and ignored as unique human beings 
who have powerful healing resources within which can be accessed, stimulated, 
and strengthened.</p> 
<p>Please keep us posted, Dr. Rakel. I am glad to call you my colleague.</p>

<p>To be clear, my comment had nothing to do with the general issues of 
whether it is better to use more or less invasive approaches (obviously, the 
less invasive the better, and I am not in favor of peddling pills over other 
accepted courses of treatment) or whether it is better to spend enough time 
with patients to ensure a proper diagnosis (clearly it is). These are red 
herrings. My point is that we need to ensure that there is a solid basis for 
any medical intervention. The human brain is prone to all kinds of irrational 
processes, and the best way to ensure we are not wrongly influenced by them is 
to subject our theories to the scientific process. It surprises (and scares) me 
to see the comments of doctors and nurses in particular who do not seem to 
recognize this.</p> 
<p>If we promote the kind of thinking advocated in this article, people will 
continue to believe that acupuncture or other false therapies can be used in 
place of conventional medicine (note one of the comments above for a good 
example of this). We can already see the influence that such lax thinking has 
brought in terms of reducing the number of people seeking vaccinations. How can 
the University of Wisconsin teach its students to rely on the scientific method 
when part of the University is pushing treatments that fail this method?</p>

<p>To those of you bashing alternative medicine, please educate yourself more 
on it first. It is a little pathetic to be ashamed of UW for this. It is called 
&ldquo;integrative&rdquo; for a reason. It is looking at a patient as a whole 
person and not just their disease (some people actually like that!). It is 
great to have your own opinion; but to be embarrassed for something that has 
brought life back to so many people, that&rsquo;s what you should be ashamed 
for. If the therapies work for people, then they are not &ldquo;false&rdquo; 
therapies. We can spend all the time we want defining the word 
&ldquo;medicine&rdquo; or we can do something about it and help patients to 
their greatest potential by complimenting our own &ldquo;Western 
Medicine&rdquo; with alternative therapies. Dr. Rakel is doing a wonderful 
thing that has inspired so many! I am deeply sorry you have not had the chance 
to experience that.</p>  &mdash; Natalie <br>

<p>I&rsquo;m a recently certified family nurse practitioner and throughout 
this article I kept thinking &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I learned!&rdquo; 
Throughout my nursing career I have been taught to treat the patient, not just 
the disease. Keep up the great work, UW! And, if you need an FNP, let me know!

<p>Keep up the good work Dr. Rakel. I am glad to see UW Health get an 
Integrated doctor like you. I wish I had a choice to see a doctor like you, but 
can&rsquo;t because of Insurance not covering it. Scientific or not, if it 
works, that&rsquo;s all that matters. I am only 48 years old and have suffered 
over 20 years with Fibromyalgia, Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, Chronic Pain, 
Chronic Headaches, Muscle Pain, Weakness, Insomnia, Stress, Anxiety, and 
Depression. I also have Degenerating Spine, Ruptured Spinal Disks, Nerve Pain, 
Arthritis, and the list goes on. Two years ago, at 46 years old, I went into 
cardiac arrest because of 2 blocked arteries and a 3rd one partially blocked. 
I&rsquo;m sure it won&rsquo;t be long before that one is totally blocked. I was 
diagnosed with Heart Disease, High Blood Pressure, Sleep Apnea, High 
Cholesterol, Pre-Diabetes, &amp; low Vitamin D. I have seen too many doctors to 
count and have been on about 100 different medications. If one didn&rsquo;t 
work they would give you another, and another, and another. Many meds were new 
with a lot of side effects, some maybe long term. Most doctors would rather 
give you meds instead of alternative ways. There is also conflict of interest 
as some doctors have financial relationships with pharmaceutical companies and 
that makes me even more uncomfortable taking meds. I&rsquo;m only on 6 meds 
now, after recently stopping 3 more of them. I believe most of my health 
problems could have been less disabling, less painful, and some even prevented 
if I could have seen an Alternative or Integrated doctor. I can&rsquo;t wait 
for the day my Insurance will pay for one of these fantastic doctors instead of 
paying MANY THOUSANDS of dollars a month for pills. Maybe then I can have a 
little bit of a joy in my life with my 2 year old grand-daughter and family. As 
of now, I am imprisoned in an unhealthy body of pain, fatigue, and misery.</p>
