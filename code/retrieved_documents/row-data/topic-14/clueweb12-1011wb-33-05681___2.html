<dd> 
<p>Dr. Qu&rsquo;s Chinese medicine techniques are excellent. She not only 
treats symptoms but offers sensible and inexpensive solutions. She offers 
genuine care. With her treatment I have come to enjoy a sense of physical, 
mental and emotional health.<br>

<p>Chinese herbal medicine is an herbal system with an unbroken tradition 
going back to the 3rd century BC. It is originating in China and well accepted 
in the mainstream of medical care throughout East Asia. Awareness related to 
Chinese herbal medicine has grown tremendously in western world due to wide 
media coverage. It is considered an alternative medical system in much of the 
Western world. Yet throughout its history it has continually developed in 
response to changing clinical conditions, and has been sustained by research 
into every aspect of its use. This process continues today with the development 
of modern medical diagnostic techniques and knowledge.</p> </dd>  &nbsp;&nbsp;
