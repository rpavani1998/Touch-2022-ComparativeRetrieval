<b>Western Medicine</b> <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<dl> 
<dd> <br>
 Western medicine is scientific-mechanistic; physiology studies 
normal mechanisms, pathology abnormal ones. These mechanisms involve an 
acceptance of determinism or necessity and they further entail a concentration 
on specific parts which are identified in the diagnosis of a particular disease.
<br> <br>
 The treatment consists in counter-mechanisms. For instance, 
pneumonia is an inflammation affecting the mechanisms in a lung. The antibiotic 
is the treatment; it provides another mechanism which corrects the pathological 
one.<br>
<br>
 Western medicine is dominated by Cartesian doctrine. Descartes 
declared that there are only two fundamental substances in the universe: 
corporeal (res extensae) and mental (res cogitantes). Patients are therefore 
diagnosed as sufferers from either bodily or mental diseases. Treatments are 
designed to correct these.<br>
<br>
Western scientific medicine has been very 
successful in the prevention and treatment of diseases and further successes 
can be expected. But millions of people are turning to complementary medicine. 
They are looking for treatments that do not fragment the sick person and that 
do not ignore the spiritual, individual and subjective sides of human life. 
Many people prefer a Holistic Medicine. Chinese medicine is an outstanding 
example of Holism.<br>

<b>Chinese Holism

<br>
</dd> </dl> <br>

<br> 
<dl> 
<dd> Chinese holism takes different forms. It accepts a whole and integrated 
natural universe, pervaded by energy, called Qi; the substratum of the universe 
is also the substratum of human life which interacts with the natural 
environment. Qi manifests itself in a material-physical and in a spiritual 
form. Qi is in constant flux and assumes different forms. It circulates in 
channels, called meridians. It nourishes body, mind and spirit; its smooth flow 
ensures health, its obstructed flow spells disease.<br>
<br>
 As a doctor, I am 
especially interested in the wholeness of body, mind and spirit, affirmed by 
Chinese medicine. Here we have a fundamental extension of the Cartesian dualism 
of body and mind. The spiritual dimension has entered the wholeness of the 
human person. It does not stand for necessity or determinism for body and mind 
which is assumed by science. The spiritual dimension stands for ethical freedom.
<br> <br>
 I can explain the meaning of this freedom by the difference between 
an angry animal attacking and wounding a person and an angry person attacking 
and wounding another person. The animal is put down to protect the public, but 
this is not punishment, as it is not guilty. The human aggressor is found 
guilty by a Court. He or she ought to have manifested his or her ethical 
freedom and ought to have resisted giving vent to anger.<br>
<br>
 For many 
years I have accepted the need to assume the existence of the spiritual 
dimension in medicine. One of my books, published in 1984, is entitled<i>Mental 
Health and Human Conscience: the true and the false self.</i> I developed a 
form of psychotherapy, called &quot;true-self psychotherapy&quot; which is 
based on a recognition of conscience, as our arbiter of right and wrong.<br>

<br> In Chinese medicine there is no place for such special recognition. The 
spiritual dimension is an integral part of the meridians which represent the 
functioning of our organs. Any disturbance in the channels is liable to cause a 
physical, mental and spiritual disturbance. Acupuncture corrects the bodily, 
mental and spiritual aspects. <br>

<p><b>the meridians</b></p> <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
back <br>

<ul> 
<dl> 
<dd> For instance, the gall bladder meridian enables us to make decisions, a 
vital spiritual act which our conscience expects from us. If a patient finds 
that he is not making vital decisions, his spiritual fault may be corrected by 
needling gall bladder 40 which, at the same time, may also correct the 
associated bodily liver disturbance which has resulted in migraine headaches.
<br> <br>
 The kidney meridian not only promotes our water metabolism; it also 
promotes our ability to persevere with essential tasks. Any such inability 
causes anxiety, as the person knows that he ought not to procrastinate. By 
needling kidney 3, the water metabolism and the perseverance of essential work 
can be normalised.<br>
<br>
 The stomach meridian ensures that food is properly 
digested. A fault in the flow of energy may cause an overloading of food, 
leading to indigestion, but also causes such an accumulation of ideas and 
duties that the patient suffers from spiritual indigestion and loses 
self-confidence. Needling stomach 45 may calm his stomach and his spirit.<br>

<br> The liver meridian provides a supply of blood to the whole body. If the 
patient has suffered severe emotional deprivation, a stagnation of liver Qi 
causes epigastric pain and severe depression so that creative spiritual 
activity is made impossible. Acupuncture of liver 3 may secure a normal balance 
in the energy flow as well as in bodily and spiritual functions.<br>
<br>
 The 
spleen meridian like the stomach meridian is concerned with food digestion. It 
also controls muscles. It houses our ability to think, to study, to focus on a 
subject and remember. Excessive mental stress in our competitive society may 
have led to constant brooding and memory fault, abdominal distension and weak 
limbs. Needling spleen 3 or spleen 6 may provide the necessary strength for 
remedying the bodily, mental and spiritual trouble.<br>
<br>
 Chinese holism 
thus involves whole making which is health. It relies on the holistic 
health-making tendency in the universe. </dd>

<p><b>yin and yang</b></p> <br>
<br>

<ul> 
<dl> 
<dd> Everything in the universe is affected by, and is part of, Yin and Yang, 
composed of two opposing and still complementary principles.<br>
 I found this 
concept very difficult and had to learn that either Yin or Yang pre-dominates. 
But I also had to realise that such predominance does not last and can be 
reversed.<br>
<br>
 Yin has a cooling and Yang a heating effect, Yin is the 
'water' nature of our body and Yang is the 'fire' nature, heating and 
activating the stored Qi into movement. Yang is energy and is non-substantial. 
Yin is matter and is substantial.<br>
<br>
 An important clinical application 
follows. Patients can be divided in those who feel too hot and those who feel 
too cold, which means that either Yin or Yang predominates. An excessive energy 
or a deficient energy of Yin or Yang is corrected by special manipulation of 
the acupuncture needle.<br>

T'ai Chi</b> <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<dl> 
<dd> <br>
 For several years I have followed the demonstrations of a T'ai Chi 
video which runs for fifty minutes and which explains the underlying 
principles. It promotes balance and vitality. Qi is encouraged to flow freely 
throughout the body as the result of certain stretching and breathing movements.
<br> <br>
 The result is &quot;physical fitness, mental alertness and spiritual 
awakening&quot;. The video explains that it accepts the Chinese principle which 
considers stagnation to be an important cause for disease. It can be avoided if 
one performs T'ai Chi regularly which encourages self-development. It is 
achieved by passing through the stages which lead to the full T'ai Chi. I have 
benefited from T'ai Chi and I have introduced this video to some of my patients 
who have found it very helpful.<br>

Shiatsu</b> <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<dl> 
<dd> <br>
 &#145;Shiatsu is a therapy which works on all the different 
energetic levels of the physical, emotional and spiritual aspects of our 
personality. It evolved from thousands of years of Oriental medical history and 
specifically from the traditional Japanese medical approach.'<br>
<br>
 
&#145;Shiatsu literally means &#147;finger pressure&#148;. The actual 
treatment, approach and philosophy are similar to those of Chinese acupuncture. 
Like acupuncture, shiatsu uses the meridians, but without the use of needles. 
Describing shiatsu as 'finger pressure' is somewhat misleading, as the 
therapist will use his thumbs, hands, elbows knees and sometimes his feet 
during treatment.'<br>
<br>
 &#145;Shiatsu works on the energy Qi which flows 
to all the pathways, known as meridians. The pressure and stretching techniques 
encourage self-healing, balance, ease and relaxation.&#146;<br>
<br>
 (Text 
from Ray Ridolfi and Susanne Franzen,<i>Shiatsu for Women,</i> Thorsons, 1996.) 
<br> <br>
 In 1997 I joined the Foundation Course, arranged by the British 
School of Shiatsu. The students were expected to practise on each other, 
instructed by the teacher. I then applied this knowledge to the treatment of my 
patients. Students are also encouraged to apply the treatment to their own 
bodily, mental and spiritual personalities.<br>
<br>
 I learnt to distinguish 
areas that feel empty, as they are lacking in energy, thus requiring 
tonification, and others that have an excess of Qi which requires softening. A 
balance has to be achieved.<br>
<br>
 I learnt that the sympathetic and 
parasympathetic systems are responsible for these phenomena. I also learnt that 
touch can be relaxing, stimulating and even painful. My fellow students 
complained that my touch was too heavy. I had the touch of a doctor who uses 
palpation to make a firm diagnosis. I was astonished when I and the patient (or 
fellow student) would still feel the Qi tingling in our hands after they had 
been lifted from the skin.<br>
<br>
 Western medicine is scientific-objective. 
The doctor and the patient are not personally related. In Shiatsu such 
objectivity is not the aim. The therapist is guided by his or her intuition and 
discovers how the patient responds - both are subjects and partners, although 
objective signs of health and illness are recorded.<br>
<br>
 Patients can be 
instructed not only to treat themselves, but also members of their families. 
For instance, a woman was able to stop her little boy's nausea and vomiting 
when she was shown how to apply pressure on pericardium 6 - the pressure having 
worked on the child's mind, stomach and liver Qi.<br>

<dd> <br>
 This section is concerned with two patients who suffered from 
important problems that Western scientific medicine was not able to solve, but 
for which Chinese medicine provided an answer.<br>
<br>
 I used Chinese 
acupuncture, but in order to also use shiatsu I employed press needles. These 
consist of a material that adheres to the skin and has a small needle attached.

<p><b>case study one</b></p> <br>
<br>

back <br>

<ul> 
<dl> 
<dd> I have been this patient's doctor for over thirty years.<br>
<br>
 She 
developed ulcerative colitis when she was in her early twenties. My treatment 
was only temporarily successful and, as there was a danger of malignant changes 
in the colon, she had the whole of her colon and rectum removed. She was fitted 
with a bag to receive the faeces from her ileum. Thus, her large intestine 
meridian could no more arrive at its pertaining organ.<br>
<br>
 A few years 
ago she developed mild colicky pains that were related to gall stones. Although 
she was told that an operation might not lead to freedom from the pain, she had 
her gall bladder with the stones removed. Her gall bladder meridian is now also 
prevented from reaching its pertaining organ.<br>
<br>
 The patient is used to 
her ileostomy, only occasionally is the discharge too liquid and she then uses 
some electrolyte replacement. But her gall bladder and liver meridians need 
attention.<br>
<br>
The colour of her tongue is normal, her pulse is wiry. She 
often complains of hypochondriac pain with distension and nausea, signs of 
liver-Qi stagnation. More important than her physical discomfort is her 
emotional and spiritual condition.<br>
<br>
 I have used gall bladder 40 in her 
case. This point has a reputation of enabling a patient to deal with resentment 
and depression apart from relieving nausea and discomfort in the hypochondrium.

<p><b>case study two</b></p> <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
back <br>

<ul> 
<dl> 
<dd> A woman aged 92. <br>
<br>
 Her syndrome: General Yin deficiency, Heart 
Yin deficiency leading to insomnia, anxiety, occasional palpitations, 
agitation, constantly getting up from sitting position, restless walking about.
<br> <br>
 In addition: Lung Yin deficiency was responsible for cough, noisy 
breathing, sticky sputum and Kidney Yin deficiency caused vertigo and poor 
memory. Bladder Yin deficiency explained her frequent desire to urinate, often 
every few minutes.<br>
 Tongue slightly swollen. Full pulse.<br>
<br>
 The 
patient was seen by a psycho-geriatrician who prescribed drugs to help her to 
sleep and to calm her.<br>
<br>
 When her restlessness and anxiety became 
uncontrolled, further medication was not considered a possibility as it would 
make her lose her balance and fall down. Therefore, Chinese medicine had to be 
given to help her. I used press needles.<br>
<br>
 My main acupoint for her was 
REN 15. This point nourishes all Yin organs and calms the mind.<br>
<br>
 I was 
delighted when I found that she became quiet and went to sleep after the 
treatment for many hours. I combined REN 15 with REN 3. There was a good 
response; her frequency of urination was much reduced. My third point was Lung 
8; the patient was encouraged to press the needle when her breathing became 
laboured.<br>
<br>
 After a few days these beneficial results stopped. It is a 
common experience that new points have to be needled. I used liver 3 together 
with large intestine 4. The reason for choosing the liver meridian was this 
patient's spiritual grievance, her resentment that she was no longer able to be 
independent. She had to agree to being washed by a carer and to be helped to 
walk about. The liver point and its associated large intestine point proved 
very successful, restoring good sleep better appetite and even bringing back 
her creative ability to draw.<br>
<br>
 These results were achieved by Chinese 
medicine, after Western medicine had failed to control her symptoms.<br>
<br>

<b>Conclusion</b> <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<br> 
<dl> 
<dd> <br>
I became interested in Chinese medicine because Western medicine had 
been unable to help me with a troublesome condition of my legs. I improved 
under Chinese medicine.<br>
<br>
 In T'ai Chi I was introduced to a form of 
physiology of Chinese medicine - a demonstration of the normal flow of energy 
which is the basis for health from a bodily, mental and spiritual point of view.
<br> <br>
 In shiatsu I learnt the importance of empathic understanding of the 
patient. Empathy is making an effort to feel another's emotions which may 
express spiritual suffering.<br>
<br>
 My preparation for the practice of 
Chinese medicine was completed when I adopted the use of acupuncture, using 
needles of different lengths apart from using press needles and using Chinese 
herbs.<br>
<br>
 Chinese medicine has been a revelation to me.<br>
