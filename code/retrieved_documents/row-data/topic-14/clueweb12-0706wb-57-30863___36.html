<h2>  Herbalist Review, Issue 2006 #1: The problem of integrating Chinese 
herbology with allopathic and western medical traditions &mdash; a personal 
perspective</h2> 
<p>by Roger W. Wicke, Ph.D.</p> 
<p>It is not always clear how to integrate knowledge from disparate health 
traditions. Without a firm foundation in the philosophies of each tradition, 
&quot;integration&quot; can be a recipe for confusion. On the other hand, 
integration without violating the internal logical consistencies of each 
tradition can often lead to great insight.</p> <br>

<h2>Introduction</h2> 
<p>An increasing number of American and European herbalists are recognizing 
the lack of a coherent assessment (&quot;diagnosis&quot;) paradigm in typical 
western herbal practice. Consequently, some herbalists have developed their own 
idiosyncratic systems. It is evident from their writings that some of these 
herbalists have borrowed significantly from Chinese herbology and Ayurveda. It 
is also evident that a growing portion of western herbalists have become 
receptive to Chinese herbology as they recognize it has the potential to fill 
in a major gap in their own techniques &#151; mainly in clinical assessment.</p>
<p>The ideas for this article arose from an extended debate among herbalists 
about how to effectively integrate herbal traditions from different cultures 
when the underlying philosophies and principles of these traditions may differ 
radically. One cannot simply mix together, simmer, and stir a bit, hoping that 
the resulting concoction will be either pleasing or useful. Without careful 
thought, the internal logical consistency of these traditions may be sacrificed 
for the appearance of eclectic wisdom, and the resulting bastardization of 
terminology may only confuse. Traditional Chinese herbology, Ayurveda, western 
herbology, and allopathic medicine are each characterized by sets of 
terminology and rules of logical deduction for which one-to-one correspondences 
are not easily described. For example, the traditional Chinese term 
&quot;Deficiency of Yin&quot; has no simple corresponding equivalent in western 
medicine. An accurate and concise description requires at least several 
paragraphs of explanation. Likewise, how does one apply recently discovered 
antimicrobial properties of various herbs that have been described in 
traditional texts long before bacteria, viruses, and other microbes were 
discovered?</p> 
<p>As traditional Chinese herbology has become popularized worldwide, the 
dominant culture of scientific materialism applies political and economic 
coercion to &quot;biomedicalize&quot; and &quot;scientize&quot; it, to make it 
more amenable to profit-making schemes. Such schemes have been described in a 
previous article:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Orwellian schemes for maximizing health-care industry profits &#151; How 
these endanger the practice of herbal medicine</li> </ul> 
<p>The desirability of integrating the best and most useful aspects of various 
herbal and health care traditions is admitted even by many mainstream medical 
practitioners. The limitations of western medicine are increasingly evident in 
dealing with chronic illnesses, antibiotic resistance, environmental toxicity, 
and disorders with significant mental-emotional-spiritual aspects. The crucial 
question is how to integrate disparate health care traditions and yet preserve 
the intellectual and practical insights that each may offer.</p> 
<h2>A personal perspective: how I've chosen to integrate knowledge from 
various sources and why</h2> 
<p>The debate on the relative merits of various systems and philosophies of 
health care have echoed throughout millenia of human history, with the forces 
of western medicine/herbology, TCM, Ayurveda, and homeopathy all jockeying for 
power, influence, and the claim of superior truth. I've come to believe that 
most people are blissfully unaffected by reason and that beneath all the 
rhetoric, we as humans tend to follow the biases in which we've been 
indoctrinated as children.</p> 
<p>So to be fair, let me explain the origins of some of my own biases. Since 
childhood I've been programming computers for entertainment, to carry out 
professional projects, and for the last 10 years, as part of a long-term 
project to develop databases and expert systems software for TCM clinical 
assessment and problem solving. Like a lot of herbalists, I began exploring 
herbs because of personal health needs. But my computer-oriented biases have 
always been in the background. When I evaluate the merits of various systems of 
herbology, I'm somewhat less interested in the religious, philosophical, or 
esthetic merits than the following criteria:</p> 
<ol> 
<li>Is it clinically effective?</li> 
<li>If so, how much of the paradigm can be reconstructed with 
mathematical/logical algorithms and programmed into software?</li> 
<li>How can this paradigm be taught to students so that they will be able to 
use it effectively and flexibly (in contrast to dogmatically) as a tool in 
their practices?</li> </ol> 
<p>I'm not interested in promoting a pseudo-religious cult under the guise of 
science, or in maintaining the philosophical purity of any ethnic tradition 
merely for its own sake &#151; there are plenty of others eager to fight over 
these issues. As such, I'm firmly entrenched in the traditional American 
pattern of borrowing ideas from other cultures when they are useful. It's very 
difficult to define a unique and independent American cuisine; our foods have 
originated from a polyglot of cultures - American Indian, Italian, French, 
German, African, Chinese, etc. Why must we as herbalists get into a snit over 
the ethnic origins of our herbal practices? Yet this issue keeps coming up in 
Internet discussion groups and conferences so much as to lead me to wonder at 
the hidden ethnic biases and insecurities that underly some of comments I've 
heard and read. Once, when I was presenting a short seminar on the principles 
of Chinese herbology at a conference of primarily western herbalists, one 
participant condescendingly dismissed my presentation with the reply &quot;But 
those ideas aren't based in the European tradition.&quot; I was speechless. I 
become utterly discombobulated when someone responds to a reasoned argument, 
not with any logical rebuttal, but rather, with a declaration that the European 
tradition is presumed superior and requires no debate.</p> 
<p>To program a computer, which is inherently free of ethnic biases and 
responds only to the rigid logic of 1's and 0's, to do something like medical 
diagnosis or TCM clinical assessment (I avoid calling it &quot;diagnosis&quot; 
for legal reasons), one requires a reasonably well defined set of rules that 
defines the assessment paradigm. Sorry, but while intuition is a fine thing, 
one cannot program a computer solely with intuition and, moreover, one cannot 
teach effectively. While I know of some western herbalists who, after years of 
study and experience, have developed their own effective methods, the lack of a 
coherent and systematic approach makes their insights difficult to communicate 
to the next generation. The Chinese were fortunate that their 
herbalist-scholars recorded the rules of their paradigm in detail, so that each 
future generation would not have to tediously rediscover these basic insights, 
and, instead, could continually refine them. The rules of TCM assessment are 
defined with a sufficient level of detail that the following computational 
criteria can be fulfilled:</p> 
<ol> 
<li>500 or so of the most common clinical symptoms and signs (e.g., fatigue, 
insomnia, abdominal distention, various fevers, various skin rashes, reddish 
tongue, yellow tongue coating) comprise the elements of a schema that defines 
about 140 distinct symptom-sign patterns. These 140 patterns, in turn, define a 
multidimensioned state-space of ill health that is relatively complete and<i>
without</i> significant holes, or localized regions in which the space is 
undefined. (It helps that the patterns happen to be chosen to facilitate 
orthogonality and linearity, two criteria for construction of a well-behaved 
state-space.) For in-depth discussion of the concept of a multidimensioned 
state-space for describing the TCM pattern-recognition paradigm. see:
<ul> 
<li>See Chapters 1-3 of Traditional Chinese Herbal Sciences, volume 1; In: 
HerbalThink-TCM software</li> </ul> </li> 
<li>The state-space described in #1 allows for one to devise a measurement 
criteria, just as with any orthogonal measurement system, that allows one to 
quantitatively measure the similarity or disparity between two clinical 
patterns.</li> 
<li>Criterion #2 then allows us to create a corresponding state-space for 
herbal properties (a simplified example: heating/cooling, drying/moistening, 
etc.) that complements the state-space of patterns. Thus for the state-space 
pattern &quot;Deficiency of Lung Yin&quot;, which is a dry-hot pattern 
affecting the lungs and throat, one would then go to the corresponding 
state-space for herbal properties and search for an herb or combination of 
herbs whose net effect would be to moisten-cool.</li> 
<li>Because individual basic patterns are defined either in terms in 
individual dimensions or N-dimensioned manifolds, they can be combined to form 
an infinite variety of complex patterns that can match almost any clinical 
manifestion. (So, for example, one can have a client with a combination of 
Liver Qi Stagnation plus Liver Yang Rising and Deficiency of Spleen Qi - a 
pattern that<i>might</i> manifest as a case of simultaneous irritable moods, 
hypertension, migraine headaches, plus intestinal &quot;dysbiosis&quot; - and 
this complex pattern can be described mathematically in the defined state space 
and quantified numerically.</li> </ol> 
<p>The reason that #2-4 above are important is that without these being 
implicit in one's paradigm, one cannot say to a student, &quot;Your herbal 
formula is way off base for this client, it will result in either death or 
severe side effects.&quot; Or &quot;Your herbal formula is close, but it might 
be even better with a bit of X thrown in.&quot; #2-4 are merely ways of wording 
the &quot;intuitions&quot; that western herbalists may have, or the conscious 
analyses that TCM herbalists conclude, in order to define the mathematics 
necessary for a computer to understand. (Although computers are free from 
ethnic biases, they require their instructions to be quite explicit so as not 
to become confused, much like beginning students of herbology.)</p> 
<p>Interestingly, during the 1990's several MIT artificial intelligence 
researchers stated that expert systems for medical diagnosis had repeatedly 
encountered a seemingly insurmountable bottleneck: while individual medical 
disease entities have specific criteria for their diagnosis, the actual 
clinical reality is far more ambiguous, for there are many combinations of 
symptoms and clinical signs that fail to yield a clear diagnosis.[a1] 
Effectively, they were admitting that medical diagnosis, in spite of and even 
because of its complexity, fails to fulfil the equivalent of criteria #1 above 
&#151; the state-space defined by conventional medical diagnosis is not only 
filled with holes, but with vast regions that are either not defined or poorly 
defined. Their conclusion was that a pre-processor stage would be required that 
parsed the data of clinical symptoms and signs into a more fundamental 
state-space of variables, which could in turn provide the framework for more 
accurate conventional medical diagnosis. It is my own conclusion that TCM theory
<i>already provides</i> the basis for the &quot;preprocessor&quot; stage that 
the MIT researchers claim is necessary to improve the performance of expert 
systems in medical diagnostics.</p> 
<p>When I first became interested in herbs 30 years ago, I had read several 
books by western herbalists, starting with John Christopher, and taking a 
number of classes. After flailing about for a while, I began reading several 
textbooks of Chinese herbology recommended by an acupuncturist friend. I was 
instantly impressed by the level of detail in the assessment system. I have 
never encountered anything in western herbology, Ayurveda, or any other herbal 
tradition, that even approaches this level of detail. Why reinvent the wheel if 
one already exists, with lubricated bearings and hub cabs even?</p> 
<p>My own experiences with homeopathy are uncertain at best, it seems 
unpredictable, but I have not studied it with enough depth to adequately 
evaluate it. I do know from studying the homeopathic materia medica, that many 
remedies have listed so many symptoms that it seems difficult to make sense of 
the priorities; I would assume that this comes with experience. However, while 
detailed symptom-sign pattern matching is the fundamental similarity between 
TCM and homeopathy, when one attempts to construct a workable state-space from 
the thousands of remedy-based patterns, it becomes quite difficult. Perhaps 
some mathematician-homeopath might attempt it, but it would seem to me a 
gargantuan task. TCM, on the other hand, strikes a balance between detail and 
conceptual elegance that facilitates constructing mathematical schema, and thus 
might fulfil the role of the &quot;pre-processor&quot; stage that the MIT 
researchers predicted would be necessary for more accurate computer-aided 
medical diagnosis.</p> 
<p>Finally, to dispel the notion that only &quot;Chinese&quot; herbs must be 
used within the TCM assessment paradigm: one can use any herb or food as long 
as one can describe it in terms of criterion #3. See the following article for 
a discussion of how this works, and how the western materia medica needs to be 
refined in order to fulfil this criteria:</p>

<h2>Guidelines for integrating Chinese herbology with other health care systems
</h2> 
<p>First, we should ask what we wish to achieve by a synthesis of the Chinese 
herbal tradition with Western systems of medicine and herbology. Integration 
merely for the sake of integration, or as an intellectual exercise, or to 
appease the delicate cultural sensibilities of one's audience is usually a bad 
idea. It often leads to a mishmash of confused ideas, slippery definitions, and 
schizophrenia.</p> 
<p>Personally, I favor a &quot;take no prisoners&quot; approach to 
intellectual synthesis. If two different systems reputedly deal with the same 
problem space (in our case, health and disease), I'll try to figure out which 
one does the best job and then simply not waste any more time on the inferior 
system, with the following exception: if there are ideas or insights in the 
inferior system that are not replicated in the other, I'll try to integrate 
these, and only these, into the better system. Discard the rest. I only have so 
much time. Let the cultural anthropologists write esoteric papers on the 
detritus; these folks do serve a valuable function as archivists of ancient 
knowledge. If I've made an error in my synthesis, then perhaps people in future 
generations can study the archives of the cultural anthropologists, then 
reassess my conclusions and attempt to patch them up.</p> 
<p>Here's a short checklist of the results of my own synthesis, which has 
evolved from a combination of trial and error, much reading, and clinical 
results, the final and ultimate test:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Of all the various herbal traditions I've studied, I've spent by far the 
most time on TCM because it has the best assessment techniques to offer the 
low-tech herbalist. If one cannot do expensive tests, then one has to rely on 
one's basics senses and the symptom perceptions of the client. For example, all 
one's knowledge of hormone physiology becomes a theoretical castle in the sky 
if one cannot measure the levels. One might speculate, but these speculations<i>
must</i> then be based on the symptoms and observable signs and their known 
correlations with hormone physiology.</li> 
<li>The teaching methodologies of TCM are in the dark ages of rote 
memorization. Numerous educational psychology studies over decades have<i>proven
</i> that certain methods work better - experiential learning to motivate and 
anchor knowledge in long-term memory, using case studies to motivate students 
to learn and memorize the most important information. In this aspect, many 
western herbal teachers are already doing a lot of things right: taste-testing 
the herbs in one's materia medica, keeping journals of one's subjective 
experiences, discussing case studies as a way to illustrate techniques and 
improve clinical skills. The brute force rote memorization techniques of 
traditional Chinese education I've simply discarded. They do not work for the 
average American student; only the very best survive this nonsense. One 
colleague who has taught at a TCM college informs me that 80% of TCM students 
feel unprepared to use herbs and eventually give up on them, primarily because 
the obsession with rote memorization has not prepared them with the practical 
skills necessary for analyzing and working through a clinical case. Instead of 
rote memorization, since 1998 we at RMHI have developed interactive computer 
game software to help students learn basic theory and data:
<ul> 
<li>Computer-aided instruction in TCM clinical analysis and decision-making 
skills</li> </ul> </li> 
<li>Since I'd estimate that 70-80% of all illnesses in America are due to diet 
and environmental factors, it is important to keep up with the latest 
discoveries in nutritional sciences and environmental health issues. The U.S. 
naturopathic profession and its allies are invaluable sources of this type of 
information. Traditional Chinese medicine has nothing to say about Aspartame, 
microwave ovens, margarine, cell phones, TVs, etc. - these did not exist until 
recent history. I find the traditional Chinese literature on diet to be largely 
irrelevant. It is a tedious distraction to search out momordica fruits to 
tonify one's Lung Yin, when the Deficiency of Lung Yin might be caused by the 
lack of a humidifier in a forced-air heating system or an improperly vented 
exhaust outlet. It is a waste of time to focus on eating exotic Chinese 
vegetables to remedy a Stomach Yin Deficiency when such a condition might be 
seriously aggravated or caused by sensitivites to various American foods, like 
soy, milk, alcohol, artificial additives, genetically modified foods, etc.</li> 
<li>Heavy metal toxicity is a widespread problem. TCM says almost nothing 
about this subject - I've asked many of my colleagues, so it's either well 
hidden or nonexistent knowledge. On the other hand, western physicians and 
naturopaths have made major breakthroughs in this area within the past decade, 
and I find these techniques to be indispensible in combination with TCM methods.
</li> 
<li>The naturopathic and alternative health community has made many 
interesting and very likely effective improvements for dealing with cancer. I 
have six friends who have survived cancer, all more than 20 years, and by 
exclusively using &quot;alternative&quot; services of several Mexican cancer 
clinics. So although hype and disinformation on reputed cancer remedies may 
abound, some of the information coming from American and European clinics on 
how to deal with cancer is far ahead of anything I've read from China. Most TCM 
reports on this subject are rehashes of the standard approach of supplementing 
radiation and chemotherapy with tonic herbs and herbs to counteract the medical 
treatment side effects. While this may be useful, I do not consider it 
&quot;cutting edge&quot; knowledge, especially in light of recent studies 
documenting the ineffectiveness of most chemotherapy and radiation treatments 
for cancer. A few years ago, the director of an internationally known cancer 
research clinic enrolled in my course. I took the opportunity to question him 
on his opinion of the current state of the art in chemotherapy and radiation 
&#151; his reply was that the vast majority of it was useless garbage (the<i>
possible</i> exceptions being certain drugs for childhood leukemia), not only 
ineffective, but likely speeding up patients' demise. He was personally much 
more interested in the work of Gerson and several Mexican cancer doctors; he 
was especially interested in accessing the detailed Gerson archives and 
reevaluating them with his newly acquired knowlege of TCM.</li> 
<li>As China continues the race to pollute and despoil its vast land area, it 
becomes increasingly important to understand how to use locally grown herbs. 
Fortunately, the TCM materia medica includes some of the very same species that 
are used as herbs in America and Europe. This could give western herbalists a 
head start in figuring out how to use these herbs in a more precisely targeted 
manner. The whole ecology and permaculture movement in the U.S. is a more 
compatible fit with the sensibilities of most American natural health patrons, 
and it makes sense to integrate this into a comprehensive herbal tradition 
rather than to be dependent exclusively on imported herbs.</li> 
<li>Western herbalists tend to emphasize the botanical aspects of herbal 
practice more than most TCM herbalists, many of whom do not even know the 
botanical species name of the herbs they use. I require my students to learn 
the botanical names; most TCM schools do not. Adulteration and species 
substitutions are a significant problem among many Chinese herb wholesalers and 
distributors. My own supplier take these matters seriously, as well as testing 
imported lots for heavy metals and pesticide levels, but until recently this 
has been the exception rather than the rule for Chinese herb companies and 
distributors.</li> 
<li>TCM assessment methods have some potentially interesting applications, 
such as helping to understand the health effects of music and sound. There is a 
vast amount of research proving beyond any doubt that music has powerful and 
often rapid effects on measurable physiological parameters, both positive and 
negative: EEG patterns, hormone levels, heart rate, even the growth pattern of 
neurons and dendritic branching patterns in the brain. Yet most of this 
research fails to ask the question why a specific piece may send one individual 
into ecstasy, whereas the same piece might trigger a headache in another. 
However, the majority of this research indicates that of all the world's music, 
European classical music (Mozart, Haydn, Bach, Beethoven) has by far the most 
generally beneficial effects. (I've never been much impressed by traditional 
Chinese music.) So in the realm of music therapy, I've used ideas from TCM 
assessment theory to evaluate and predict each individual's unique response to 
a piece of music, but I've chosen to focus on the classical European repertoire.
</li> 
<li>The phytochemical and pharmacological data coming out within the past 20 
years or so on herbs, including Chinese herbs, is useful supplementary 
information. It will never replace the traditional information, as any medical 
practice is always based on the symptoms and observable clinical signs at the 
first level of analysis, and I feel that TCM does this first level best. 
However, western scientific knowledge of herbal pharmacology and toxicology has 
definitely added a useful layer of understanding. As a consequence of this 
information, I have shifted toward a more conservative use of certain herbs to 
avoid long-term toxicity effects.</li> </ul> 
<p>A number of herbalists have commented on the problems of studying ancient 
masters whose writings seem only barely relevant to current human conditions. 
For example, microwave ovens, synthetic sweeteners, genetically modified foods, 
and margarine did not exist until the late 20th century; we cannot expect much 
wisdom from the ancient masters in addressing problems in modern nutrition and 
environmental toxicity. However, what I like about the TCM assessment system is 
that it provides an accurate, computer-reproducible, rule-based system for 
describing and analyzing patterns of symptoms &#151; these basic patterns of 
the body's reponses are almost universal in scope. They can be used just as 
readily to describe the effects of radiation damage, purified hormones, and 
many chemical pollutants, even though these did not exist before the 20th 
century.</p> 
<h2>Phenomenological vs. causal reasoning</h2> 
<p>TCM is a concise and detailed phenomenological system of correspondences, 
not an exposition of &quot;causes&quot; in the western sense of scientific 
materialism; its primary objective is to match up descriptions of whole-body 
patterns of easily recognized symptoms and clinical signs (tongue, pulse, body 
appearance) with herbs and herbal formulas historically observed to be 
effective for specific whole-body patterns. That is also perhaps why it has 
endured so long. (After all, how often do textbooks of science become outdated 
because their explanations of scientific causes becomes disproven or replaced 
by causal explanations of greater complexity?) Although limited in scope, what 
it set out to do, it does well. In a way, it is much like statistics, 
describing the correlations among symptoms and clusters of symptoms and how 
these clusters or patterns are likely to evolve and transform into other 
patterns.</p> 
<p>While I am aware that Chinese texts talk about &quot;causes&quot;, these 
are usually not causes in the western scientific sense of materialistic 
causation. That is not necessarily a disadvantage, and as I discuss in my 
textbooks, it is often a distraction to interpose a theorized physical basis 
for causation when the real goal in clinical practice is to match an effective 
herbal formula with the totality of the symptom-sign pattern so as to relieve 
it, whatever the &quot;cause&quot; or &quot;causes&quot;. The primary flaw of 
western medicine is that is has become so obsessed with materialistic chains of 
causality that it often ignores the systemic whole-body patterns that are 
screaming for attention. Rather than &quot;causes&quot;, I prefer to think in 
terms of &quot;contributing factors&quot;.</p> 
<p>In the textbooks I've written, I've taken pains to explain why the 
fundamental basis for TCM is not a causal one. A good majority of the terms 
used in TCM are functional rather than materialistic in nature. For example, 
&quot;Qi&quot; causes a lot of confusion. I find it amusing when some scientist 
speculates on what Qi might look like under the microscope or how it could be 
detected. Qi is not a physical substance; even the word &quot;energy&quot; is a 
crude and misleading translation. Traditionally and in a clinical sense, Qi is 
said to promote harmonious transformation within the body, to provide for 
retention of the body's organs and substances, and to warm the body. It is 
defined most accurately by the consequences of its absence or deficiency: 
fatigue, pallor, weak and quiet voice, soft-weak pulse, pale-tender tongue, and 
possibly organ prolapse, spontaneous perspiration, proneness to bruising and 
bleeding disorders. What is Qi physically? One can speculate as to all the 
physiological phenomena that might result in this pattern, such as insufficient 
thyroid hormone. But thyroid hormone is<i>not</i> Qi, nor are nerve action 
potentials, nor anything else, though these things might be correlated with Qi 
to varying degrees. Qi is a<i>phenomenon</i>, not a material substance that 
participates in a chain of causality in the western scientific sense. It is a 
practical term that summarizes functions that can be recognized by manifested 
symptoms, without intervention of technological measurement devices.</p> 
<h2>Medical disease diagnosis vs. TCM assessment</h2> 
<p>It is crucial to separate the idea of western medical disease diagnosis 
from TCM pattern assessment, and avoid debating the choices of herbal formulas 
for western diseases<i>unless</i> the TCM patterns are also considered. </p> 
<p>I advocate that new students new to TCM, especially medical doctors and 
nurses,<i>temporarily</i> set aside their medical way of thinking while 
learning TCM theory and assessment. I assure them than after they have learned 
the patterns thoroughly, they will find that their medical knowledge regains 
its usefulness as a way to<i>fine-tune</i> the basic TCM assessment in given 
case, but to prematurely attempt integrating would only lead to confusion.</p> 
<p>Most medical diagnostic terms have no one-to-one correspondences in the 
traditional Chinese theory of health and illness, and within the traditional 
Chinese paradigm, it is the medical diagnostic terms that suffer from excessive 
vagueness. For example &quot;AIDS&quot;, &quot;fibromyalgia&quot;, 
&quot;autoimmune disorders&quot;, &quot;hepatitis&quot; are not precisely 
targeted diagnostic terms; one cannot design an herbal formula &quot;for 
AIDS&quot;, &quot;for autoimmune disorders&quot;, or for most other medically 
defined conditions without knowing the specific symptom-sign pattern or 
patterns involved in a specific case. The basic patterns in TCM are quite 
adequate for describing these problems in sufficient detail to point one toward 
appropriate herbal formulas and dietary regimes, with a few exceptions, such as 
autoimmune conditions associated with heavy metal toxicity. I've seen all these 
conditions in my own practice. I know quite a few people who were diagnosed 
with AIDS and/or were HIV+ and have survived more than 20 years without doing 
any toxic drugs, only diet and lifestyle changes plus herbal formulas 
occasionally. The cases of AIDS I've seen were all over the map as far as TCM 
patterns and formulas that were given. In my opinion there is no such thing as 
a single herbal formula appropriate &quot;for AIDS&quot;. This is western 
medical thinking and simply does not work that well.</p> 
<p>A lot of interest has arisen regarding epidemic illnesses such as 
hemorrhagic fevers. Here again, it is crucial to match the herbal formula to 
the pattern of presenting symptoms. The identity of the microbe is a minor 
consideration. The ancient Chinese devised successful herbal formulas for 
epidemic illnesses long before the science of microbiology came onto the scene. 
There are numerous herbs with broad-spectrum antibacterial and antiviral 
activity; much more important to consider are matching the herbal formula to 
the stage of the fever, degree of thirst and dehydration, presence or absence 
of delirium, rashes, hemorrhaging, excessive perspiration, etc.</p> 
<p>Though hemorrhagic fevers are generally rare, I suspect we will be seeing 
more of these, and we may not have to wait long if the H5N1 virus in SE Asia 
becomes a worldwide pandemic. I've been involved as a consultant in several 
cases of hemorrhagic fevers for which the doctors in the hospital had 
essentially pronounced that they had tried everything in their arsenal, the 
patient would soon be dead, and they gave their blessing to try herbs as a last 
resort. All recovered. One individual went from having a 105 deg.F. fever with 
early-stage acute renal failure to an almost normal temperature with regained 
kidney function within 6 hours of drinking a large dose of herbal tea, and was 
discharged from hospital as they needed the beds for other similar cases. In 
all these cases the herbal formulas were only slightly modified from the 
standard TCM formulas for Ying- and Xue-stage Virulent Heat (Wen Bing) patterns.
</p> 
<p>The traditional Chinese literature (the Shang Han Lun and Wen Bing) nicely 
complements modern microbiological understanding of infectious illness, but to 
debate over causes can become a war of words. Pasteur himself stated before his 
death that he regretted that medical doctors and researchers had become so 
obsessed with microbial causes, as he realized that infectious illnesses 
resulted from a complex interaction among various factors, including the 
condition of the individual, the microbial flora, and environment.</p> 
<p>For more discussion of how traditional Chinese theory of feverish illnesses 
(Wen Bing) is applied practically, see:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>SARS and TCM theories of epidemic illness</li> </ul> 
<h2>On the merits of Ayurveda vs. TCM</h2> 
<p>Although Ayurveda has useful insights to offer, its system of assessment if 
far less sophisticated; this becomes evident when comparing textbooks on TCM 
assessment (with typically around 120-140 distinct patterns defined and 
discussed) with those of Ayurveda. All the Ayurvedic courses and texts I have 
read focus on the theory of the three doshas (Vatta, Pita, Kapha), but don't go 
much beyond this level. TCM should acknowledge its debt to Ayurveda, as 
historically, Ayurveda was transmitted along with Buddhism via Tibet and then 
into China. Greco-Roman medicine during the time of Hippocrates and later had a 
similar four-element humoral theory of illness. Some historians believe that 
all these theories had their historical origins in India around the 500 B.C. 
period or earlier.</p> 
<p>There are several aspects of Ayurveda that I have included in my course 
material, which I believe have been somewhat obscured and watered down in TCM. 
The first is the theory of the seven tastes and their inherent actions: thermal 
nature (hot/cold), humidity (dry/moist), and density (light/heavy). Also the 
idea that each taste may have differing predigestive, digestive, and 
postdigestive effects is consistent with the observation that various ingested 
substances, as they become digested and metabolized, will affect tissues they 
contact differently. The second is in the realm of diet. I once took a short 
course in Ayurvedic cooking; I've never tasted such delicious food that also 
felt healthy afterward. I've used this information in simple diet and cooking 
classes for clients. A lot of people have the idea that nutritious food will 
taste bad, bland, or uninspiring. Ayurvedic cooking proves this idea wrong, and 
I use the properties of the basic tastes to explain how to put together a meal 
that is balanced for a given individual and that also tastes good. While TCM 
doctors give lip service to the idea of good diet, Ayurvedic doctors place much 
greater emphasis on diet, and this aspect is certainly important in dealing 
with American clients whose diets are typically disastrous.</p> 
<h2>Summary</h2> 
<p>The optimal synthesis of traditional Chinese herbology with western 
medicine and science entails using traditional Chinese methods for describing 
whole-body patterns of symptoms and clinical signs and to incorporate knowledge 
from modern nutrition, biochemistry, pharmacology, microbiology, and pathology 
as means of<i>fine-tuning</i> the choice of herbs, formulas, dietary 
recommendations, and other therapies. The converse of this approach, which is 
to discard the Chinese model of pattern analysis and to choose clinical 
strategies based on medical disease criteria, is a method which is crude, 
simplistic, and ignores thousands of years of traditional Chinese medical 
wisdom. (Yet this is effectively what happens when one asks the question 
&quot;What herbal formula is good for disease X?&quot; and ignores all other 
considerations.)</p> 
<p>As traditional Chinese herbology is a descriptive, phenomenological system, 
its insights remain valid regardless of advances in scientific materialism 
(materialistic causality). The two systems operate on distinctly different 
planes of thought and reasoning, and, consequently, they are mutually 
complementary.</p>
