<h2><strong>Why Ayurveda Needs Quantum Mechanics</strong></h2> 
<p><strong>Introduction: Back to Our Roots</strong></p> 
<p>There is an Ayurvedic adage, &lsquo;To ensure the longevity of a tree one 
must maintain its roots&rsquo;. The &lsquo;root&rsquo; I wish to address is the 
ancient Vedic philosophical foundation of our sacred Ayurvedic tradition.</p> 
<p>This article is based on the conviction that our roots have been severed 
and the traditional art of Ayurvedic medicine is dying--both on the 
subcontinent of India, the main trunk of the tree, and consequently overseas 
where branches of this venerable tree are trying to grow. This article may 
indeed seem off-base, written at a time when Ayurvedic administrators in India 
and around the world are celebrating major advances in the field, such as 
increasing numbers of students, physicians, research papers, patients, 
colleges, and hospitals, which all appear to reflect a resurging state of 
Ayurvedic medicine. We hear misguided advocates shouting at the top of their 
lungs, the mantra of propagation of Ayurveda. But if we view our tradition as a 
living organism and listen intently to the deeper layers of its pulse, it 
becomes evident that the original vitality of the system is waning, though this 
underlying condition may be masked by a steroidal blush on the surface. Our 
precious roots have been severed. The true essence of our philosophical 
foundations has been lost almost in its entirety. At best it has become little 
more than a collection of unanimated slokas. However, it just may be that the 
time is right for these roots to re-grow and once again establish 
Ayurveda&rsquo;s original connection to the Absolute which for some time has 
been broken. I will explain what I see to be this auspicious timing in this 
paper.<br>
This paper is also a call for Ayurveda to regain its self-respect. 
In my opinion, it is one of the most tragic problems of 21th century Ayurvedic 
medicine that it feels compelled to solicit for legitimacy by only conducting 
&ldquo;scientific&rdquo; research that conforms to the parameters of Western 
medicine. To illustrate the absurdity that can spring from this situation, I 
would like to relate an incident that occurred at the National Institutes of 
Health in 1991.</p> 
<p>The eminent Ayurvedic physician Dr. V.N. Pandey and I were invited there to 
present evidence for the efficacy of a certain herbal preparation in reducing 
the size of uterine fibroid tumors of small to medium size. After several 
decades of consistently positive outcomes of hundreds of his patients and those 
of his many colleagues, in addition to the authoritative testimony of the 
Ayurvedic texts, he decided to bring it to the attention to the modern world, 
which I facilitated. Our idea was to initially offer the preparation only to 
patients not in any imminent danger, who had not responded to conventional 
therapy and for whom there were no remaining options except major surgery. We 
thought the meticulous case studies presented would have sufficed to get the 
project started, but now modern procedures demanded that direct action of the 
herbal preparation on the fibroid tumor in tissue culture must first be 
verified in a laboratory setting. Dr. Pandey explained that Ayurvedic 
preparations such as this one did not work directly but rather required an 
interaction with the entire physiology (i.e immune, endocrine, nervous systems, 
etc) of the individual to be effective. Also for individuals of different 
prakritis, the formulation would need to be individualized. Furthermore, this 
Ayurvedic medicine is designed to pass through the digestive processes of 
metabolic transformation rather than be applied to fibroid cells in a petry 
dish (which is essentially what was done). The NIH lab director explained that 
unless a &ldquo;direct effect&rdquo; effect could be demonstrated, not only 
would the project be aborted, but that plant species would be ineligible 
forever from further investigations in his lab. He explained this policy was 
the NIH&rsquo;s way of focusing only on plants which, by their criteria, had 
the most promise.</p> 
<p>To no one&rsquo;s surprise, when the assays for direct effect were 
conducted nothing happened. The project failed to proceed to clinical trials of 
any kind. This incident exemplified how the elaborate procedures of Western 
reductionist science can project highly distorted conclusions, producing 
&ldquo;scientific&rdquo; results that are essentially non-scientific. Does not 
the prolific depth of Ayurvedic medicine present a coherent holistic approach 
that warrants an effort to work the other way round? Must we always use the 
scientific method of Western science before we sanctify meditation, herbal 
medicine, marmas or other aspects of Ayurvedic medicine? Could we not utilize 
so far inexplicable Ayurvedic concepts such as the Tridosha, Ojas, Ama, and 
Agni, to actively inspire the nature and direction of modern scientific 
experiments? As the tradition of Ayurvedic medicine advances into the 21st, it 
must recapture inner respect for its own wisdom not by inaugurating Ayurvedic 
schools in foreign lands or fighting for laws which permit the overseas sale of 
medicines, but rather by revitalizing our connection with our roots, however 
mystical they might be. Now that the strangeness of quantum mechanics has been 
discovered and accepted, there couldn&rsquo;t be a better time for this to 
happen.</p> 
<p><strong>The Early Vedic Paradigm: The Art of Healing</strong><br>
The 
initial phase of development of Indian medicine can be traced back to India's 
Indus River civilization which flourished from about 2700 to 1500 B.C. The 
cosmology and realizations associated with this civilization were written down 
as mythico-religious Sanskrit hymns in a quaternary literary achievement known 
as the four Vedas. Ayurveda is considered an upaveda (&ldquo;applied 
knowledge&rdquo;; upa-near; next to) of the latest of these, the Atharva Veda 
(1000-1500 B.C.) and thus its teachings considered the highest possible 
category of knowledge. The rational modern mind, which derives its knowledge 
either through intellectual reasoning or sensory observation, i.e. metaphysical 
or scientific method, assumes that the sublime knowledge of the Vedas must have 
been the result of active metaphysical speculation emerging out of an attempt 
to intellectualize and elevate the primitively imaginative and raw religious 
experiences of the Vedic rishis. This assumption is an error caused by the 
projection of our own modern mental processes into the very different mentality 
of the Vedic rishis. The higher mental processes of the ancient world were not 
dominantly intellectual (speculative-based) nor empiric (observation based), 
but rather intuitive.</p> 
<p>Those uniquely human inner operations, our most transcendent, most 
brilliant, most incomprehensible processes, are our grandest and most powerful 
sources of knowledge. However, to the logical reasoning mind, they have a very 
obscure meaning and doubtful validity. Revelation, inspiration, intuition, and 
instinctive insight were the foremost processes of ancient enquiry. To the 
logical reason of modern men revelation is a chimera, inspiration only a 
selection of thoughts or words wrapped in emotion, intuition a swift and 
obscure form of reasoning, insight a brilliant and perspicacious method of 
guessing. But to the Vedic mind they were not only real and familiar, but valid 
processes of knowing. Our Vedic predecessors held them to be the supreme means 
of arriving at truth. If someone were to author a true epistemology of Vedic 
wisdom, it would indeed place the concepts underlying the ancient words dristi, 
sruti, smriti, shravana, nididhyasana at the center of the analysis. Unless 
these ideas are appreciated, it is impossible to understand how the old rishis 
arrived so early in human history at knowledge which, whether accepted or 
denied, electrify and expand the horizons and admiration of even the most 
steadfast modern intellectual. How did the ancient Vedic rishis discover 
ultimate universal truths about reality without laboratories and scientific 
equipment? The Swetaswatara Upanishad gave us a clue and told us the Supreme 
Reality can be grasped through a &ldquo;pure heart, purified intellect, and 
purified mind&rdquo; (Hrida manisha manasa abhiclipto).</p> 
<p><strong>The Later Vedic Paradigm: The Science of Healing</strong></p> 
<p>So why did the mind of the ancient Vedic rishi operate so differently from 
the mind of the Ayurvedic healer who followed him a mere thousand years later?
</p> 
<p>The term &ldquo;paradigm&rdquo; is used to describe the set of experiences, 
beliefs and values that affect the way an individual perceives reality and 
responds to that perception. Paradigms are shaped both by the society&rsquo;s 
cultural ideological background and by the presuppositions in the historical 
foreground. A prevailing scientific paradigm determines not only what features 
of Nature should be observed and studied but also which questions are even 
acceptable to even ask. For example, our current scientific paradigm denies the 
possibility of time travel or non-local psychic phenomena, so therefore these 
concepts never even arise in the minds of most people to explain observed 
events. Yet the possibility of life on other galaxies is an accepted question. 
A paradigm is the conceptual framework and limits within which human thought 
and ideas evolve. A &quot;paradigm shift&quot; denotes a change in what a given 
society accepts and includes in its understanding of reality. This is precisely 
what occurred as the Vedic period was drawing to a close approximately 500 BC.
</p> 
<p>Historically, Vedic healers, who clearly contemplated the relationship 
between mind and the material universe, always understood the role of the 
intuitive conscious mind to be preeminent. Through insight, revelation and 
intuition they arrived at the truth that consciousness and matter are not 
fundamentally distinct but rather are two complementary aspects of one reality. 
&ldquo;Charakas&rdquo; are thought by some to be the general name of the 
wandering mendicants of this age who became expert in healing and who 
contributed to the early theory and practice of Ayurveda. These healers 
integrated their deep knowledge of the local flora and mastery of healing 
techniques with wisdom they gained by observing priests who specialized in 
sacrificial rites and the use of efficacious incantations and ceremonies to 
influence and control the cosmic forces. Towards the end of the Vedic period 
which flourished for two millennia this all-encompassing view of reality was 
gradually undermined and eventually got turned on its head by a materialist 
philosophy which denied any role of consciousness or the mind in the 
fundamental fabric of reality.</p> 
<p>Traces of materialism appear even in the earliest recordings of Indian 
thought. Just as the small dots of opposite color nestled within each half of 
the Taoist &ldquo;yin-yang&rdquo; symbol remind us of the interdependent, 
mutually-arising nature of opposites, the essence of materialism already 
existed in Vedic spiritualism. There are early Vedic references to a figure 
known as Brhaspati and his followers who were &ldquo;unbelievers&rdquo;. 
Essentially, Brhaspati espoused an early form of naturalism, which vehemently 
rejected the existence of a spiritual realm and the eternal nature of reality. 
It claimed the exclusive epistemological authority of perception. Furthermore, 
it attempted to explain existence in terms of the four material elements (air, 
fire, water and earth). This philosophy denied the existence of the Soul or 
anything immaterial and put forward that the world itself and all material 
objects of the world are real. Knowledge of reality was valid only through 
direct perception, and not through inference or intuition. This directly 
contradicts the orthodox Vedic proclamations, Brahma satyam jagan mithya 
(Brahman alone is real, the world is unreal) and sarvam khalvidam Brahman (all 
this that we see in the world is Brahman). On a slightly different note, there 
was also a decidedly hedonistic aspect to Indian materialistic thought. As a 
reaction against the ascetic and meditative practices of the religiously devout 
Brahmins, Indian Materialism celebrated the pleasures of the body. People began 
gratifying their senses with no restraint and pleasure was asserted as the 
highest good. Testimony to this is the Kama Sutra, a famous ancient treatise on 
sexual practices, usually dated to the second century A.D.</p> 
<p>The spread of Indian Materialism led to the mindset that matter can be of 
value in itself. Materialist thought dignified the physical world and began to 
bring authority to the natural sciences. In fact, the Materialist emphasis on 
empirical validation of truth became the guiding principle of the Scientific 
Method which has survived to the present day. A thousand years after the 
emergence of Indian Materialism, John Locke would reformulate it into the 
beginnings of modern empiricism, which again declared the only valid knowledge 
humans can have is based upon sensory experience. Whereas the authority of 
empirical evidence carried little weight in ancient pre-Vedic and Vedic India, 
modern thought began to value the systematic, logical and cautious epistemology 
that first appeared as Indian materialist thought. This was the all important 
change which represented the paradigm shift of the late Vedic period.</p> 
<p>Interestingly, despite the lofty heights of human wisdom that was attained 
by these pious and contemplative seers, this undermining of Vedic spirituality 
was achieved with remarkable success and ease. This was because, once 
initiated, essentially it became a wave that over time engulfed the entire 
world. The methodology was to separate what hitherto had been indivisible. In 
the realm of healthcare, it started insidiously in the late Vedic period with 
categorization and codification of disease entities. The human being was 
described for the first time in terms of separate organs and systems. A 
man&rsquo;s organs, and the man himself, became more and more defined by his 
separate identity, which he vigorously preserved and protected as never before. 
He gradually lost his sense of connection to &ldquo;outside&rdquo; nature. This 
was in distinct contrast to the Vedic viewpoint wherein mankind is whole and 
not &ldquo;outside&rdquo; of anything. On the contrary in orthodox Vedanta 
since Brahman is all-encompassing, as an observer of reality, man is regarded 
as the mind of the universe observing itself.</p> 
<p>This understanding began to fade. Codification soon resulted in the 
emergence of eight &ldquo;subspecialties&rdquo; of Ayurveda, including the 
subspecialty of psychiatry, which singled out the mind. The two famous 
compendiums of Ayurvedic medicine appeared, the Caraka and Sushruta Samhitas 
(c. 2nd century AD). The priest-healer who served as a conduit between 
universal and individual spirit was replaced by the either the gurukulum- or 
institutionally-trained Ayurvedic physician who now applied academic and 
ethical standards. Throughout the early AD period and middle ages, there was a 
fragile thread still connected to the past which acknowledged Atman and the 
non-material aspect of life. However more and more emphasis was placed on 
dietary, herbo-mineral medicines, and other physical remedies to promote 
health. Ritual and mantra faded from the medical mindscape.</p> 
<p>The medieval period of Indian history extending from the fifth through the 
fifteenth century A.D. began as a time when India entered into trade contracts 
with many sovereign foreign lands. These included Arabia, Syria, Babylonia, and 
later with Rome, Greece, and Africa. Eventually, Muslims from Western Asia not 
only availed themselves through mutual trade of India&rsquo;s considerable 
natural riches, but began to brutally invade, conquer, loot, and annihilate its 
people. Muslim rule not only dramatically changed Indian culture, literature, 
traditions, and religion but also impacted its system of medicine. History 
clearly reveals that Ayurveda though assaulted, weakened and changed throughout 
this tumultuous millennium, preserved its philosophical roots. Like Hinduism 
itself, Ayurveda displays great flexibility and resilience which allowed it to 
adapt to the needs of the time. It adapted by pragmatically assimilating the 
prevailing medical system of its conquerors, Unani Tibb Medicine, into its 
dogma. Concurrently, for its survival, Ayurveda relinquished its remaining 
connection with its early Vedic mythico-magical revealed wisdom. The most 
important contribution of the medieval period to Ayurveda came in the form of 
the many Nighantus (expanded commentaries) which were written during this time 
in a noble attempt by the vaidyas of the time to rescue and arrange the 
remnants of the surviving literature and knowledge. The subject matter was 
distinctly practical and material--primarily the addition of many medicinal 
plants which were not mentioned in the earlier samhitas and treatises. The 
Sarangadhara Samhita (c. 13th century A.D.) describes the use of opium, 
mercuric oxides, and stresses the importance of physical examination and pulse 
interpretation in diagnosis.</p> 
<p><strong>Materialism Matures and Peaks</strong></p> 
<p>But the crescendo of the undermining of the mind came in the 
mid-seventeenth century with the elaboration of the dualistic philosophy of 
Rene Descartes, which described a complete ontological distinction between the 
perceived physical universe and the perceiving mind. In formulating his 
metaphysics Descartes had split reality into two separate realms. On the one 
hand there was the res extensa: the world of solid bodies extending into space 
and independent of human mental processes; on the other, the res cogitans, or 
the inner realm of the perceiving mind. Only the former was capable of 
consistent mathematical description and was gradually developed into the 
intricate mechanistic concept of reality: every phenomenon in the universe 
could eventually be explained in terms of natural laws governing the motion and 
collision of matter. Mechanism, in turn, logically leads to determinism which, 
thanks to Newton, says that since all phenomena can be explained entirely 
through the behavior of matter with physical laws, then just as surely as a 
billiard ball struck by a cue ball with velocity x at a 45&deg; angle will move 
in an opposite complementary 45&deg; angle with velocity y, all phenomena are 
likewise completely determined by the properties of that matter and the 
operations of those natural laws. The realm of the mind, in contrast, involved 
primarily ideas and emotions which precluded strict<br>
mathematical treatment. 
Consequently, it was removed from the mainstream of scientific thought for two 
centuries. Along with the rest of human thought, the original instinctive 
realized wisdom of Ayurveda became eroded in favor of a more evidence-based, 
measurement-verified, empirical method of knowledge. The Vedic 
&ldquo;svasthya-healer-social body-subjective intuitive&rdquo; paradigm became 
metamorphosed into &ldquo;disease-curer-individual body-scientific 
objectivity&rdquo; of Western or modern medicine.</p> 
<p>Now that this insidious paradigm has been established for more than a 
thousand years, we find Ayurveda being propagated out into the Western world 
where it [materialism] is strongest. Isaac Newton&rsquo;s discovery of the 
Universal Laws of Motion in the late seventeenth century single-handedly 
solidified the materialist paradigm started by Brhaspati and elaborated by 
Descartes. The scientific revolution which treasures its objective observations 
and experiments was unleashed and had no rival for the next two hundred years. 
Scientists believed that the connection between any cause and effect could be 
known by discovering the natural laws which determined it. This belief that 
natural laws drive every phenomenon has led to modern scientist striving to 
find the ultimate single universal law or energy behind everything, the 
so-called unified &ldquo;theory of everything&rdquo; which has eluded 
scientists. This obsession with cause and effect describes interactions only 
among material things, and has distanced us even further from including the 
mind or soul of conscious beings in the modern paradigm.</p> 
<p>Though superficially familiar with terms like Atman, Brahman, agni, prana, 
ojas, etc. most Western Ayurvedic &ldquo;practitioners&rdquo; and patients 
despite their best intentions are limited by their conditioned minds in their 
ability to penetrate the true essence of Ayurveda. Therefore, one consequence 
of this incomplete understanding and transmission is that today there are sadly 
many more individuals who are certain of its invalidity than those who resonate 
with it. Certainly, knowledge obtained through ritual trances, prayer, and 
revelation would be ridiculed by many and a medical strategy based on such 
knowledge adopted by few modern patients. But there is another far more 
troubling consequence: modern Ayurvedic physicians have lost their connection 
to their original Vedic roots. To the modern Ayurvedist it seems irrelevant to 
ponder the mysteries of consciousness or mythical imagery from a distant past. 
Our time is better spent memorizing plant genera and practical treatment 
protocols.</p> 
<p>But whatever the validity or the lack of it attached to these ancient 
methods of knowing, only by somehow reproducing the ancient Vedic process and 
re-discovering its original starting-point can we recover also what, to the 
intellect, is hopelessly obscure in Ayurveda and Vedanta.<br>
The ancients were 
not at all concerned with documenting in literal and explicit language their 
observations of the physical world for posterity as we do today. Their concern 
was the vast movement of consciousness and the oneness of micro and macrocosm; 
and the eternal character of the cosmos is what adds an ageless quality to the 
language of their hymns. That language holds the key to deciphering what 
appears at first to be cryptic and obtuse writings. However, we must also bear 
in mind that the Vedas are not textbooks or user manuals. They are collections 
of prayers and hymns in an impressionistic language whose multi-dimensions are 
largely ignored today. But in the Vedic Age this language was universal and 
required no interpretation. To make a connection with that ancient culture, we 
do not necessarily need to live the exact same inner experience or speak the 
same ancient language. However, we will be required to leave aside the methods 
of modern intellectual scholarship for a while, as well as all our conditioned 
preferences and weltanschauung. If we want those symbols of another age to 
speak to us once again we will need to accept a new, expanded paradigm of 
reality.</p> 
<p>By analogy, if we know of the existence of a lost treasure, but have not a 
single clue to its exact whereabouts, we could never find it; but if we have a 
clue, however enigmatic, left behind by the original owners, we can decipher 
its meaning, set out in the right direction and recover the long lost wealth. 
What&rsquo;s more, we do not necessarily need to retrace the exact original 
steps to arrive at the destination; we may take an entirely different path to 
get back there. We probably can&rsquo;t recover ancient Ayurvedic revelations 
thru primitive Vedic mythico-religious hymns, sacrifices, rituals, etc. or 
through the intellectual mind. Technology and cultural barriers have now 
irreversibly developed and become embedded in the fabric of modern life; 
civilization&rsquo;s prevailing paradigm is now much more complex.</p> 
<p>Until recently there was no discernable way back&hellip;until the emergence 
in the early 1900&rsquo;s of quantum physics&hellip;</p> 
<p><strong>Quantum Mechanics</strong></p> 
<p>One of the earliest and greatest fundamental discoveries of Ayurveda was 
the Law of Uniformity of Nature or Loka-Purusa-Samanya (CS Sa. 5.1): 
puruso&rsquo; yam lokasammitah---which followed from observations of the 
intimate relationships between the micro- and macrocosms. It says that the same 
universal laws which operate on the largest scales of Nature are identical with 
those at the most minute scales. Minute observations of Nature and its 
phenomena have opened the doors to theories about gravitation, thermodynamics, 
electricity, magnetism, and life itself. But it was in our unbridled zeal to 
use technology and look ever more closely at Nature in a quest to discover the 
smallest, most fundamental particle of matter that science inadvertently and 
unwillingly stumbled upon the realm of quantum physics.<br>
As the Middle Ages 
ended knowledge about natural phenomena was rapidly increasing. One remaining 
debate about the wave vs. particle nature of light was apparently finally 
settled by Isaac Newton (1642-1727) who had authoritative arguments that light 
was a stream of minute particles. Here were some of his points. Firstly, light 
travels in a straight line, like bullets, unless interrupted by some 
intervening object; second, light reflects off a mirror at the exact angle at 
which it hits; thirdly when light bounces off an irregular surface it scatters 
widely; and finally light travels through the vacuum of space from the sun to 
reach earth. Waves require a medium in which to propagate, particles do not; 
therefore light cannot be a wave and must be corpuscular. The particle theory 
of light persisted for more than100 years until Thomas Young&rsquo;s famous 
double-slit experiment which he conducted in 1803.</p> 
<p><strong>The Double-slit Experimen</strong></p> 
<p>If light travels as particles we can imagine particles of light (photons) 
as bullets fired from a rifle. Imagine a wall with two holes in it, each the 
same size and just large enough for the bullets to fit through, with a second 
wall behind where the bullets will strike. After firing a few rounds you would 
expect to see on the second wall two clusters of hits in line with the two 
holes. This is of course precisely what you get with bullets, so if we get the 
same result with photons we can say they are particles.</p> 
<p>Now, with the same setup, imagine that instead of particles, that light 
travels as a wave. The wave would reach both holes at the same time and each 
hole would then act as a new source. Waves would then spread out again from 
each of the two holes, exactly in phase, and as the waves moved forward, 
spreading as they go, they would eventually interfere with one another. Imagine 
for a moment these were water waves. Where both waves are lifting the water 
surface upward, we get an additive effect and a more pronounced crest; where 
one wave is cresting and the other is troughing the two cancel out and the 
water level is undisturbed. The effects are called constructive and destructive 
interference.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Now similarly with light waves, the pattern on the second wall would appear 
as an interference pattern of alternate light and dark bands across the wall. 
Particles, on the other hand, would produce two separate areas of light (where 
the bullets would hit). This experiment has in fact been carried out many, many 
times, with the same results every time, and the results are nothing less than 
amazing. Here&rsquo;s why&hellip;<br>
When the experiment is set up as shown in 
the above diagram, with both slits open, the resulting interference pattern 
clearly shows that light behaves as a wave. Now if that was all there was to it 
we could say &lsquo;case closed&rsquo; and conclude that light travels as a 
wave; but there is much more to it than that. This is where the word 'weird' 
will no doubt occur to you.</p> 
<p>If the experiment, still with both holes open, is set up to fire individual 
photons, so that only one photon at a time goes through the set up, we would 
not expect the same interference pattern to build up; we would surely expect 
that a single photon would only go through one hole or another, it cannot go 
through both at the same time and create an interference pattern. So what 
happens?<br>
If we wait until enough (millions) individual photons have passed 
through to build up a pattern, we do not get two bullet-like clusters opposite 
the two holes, we get the wave-like interference pattern! It is as if each 
individual photon 'knows' that both holes are open and gives that result. Each 
individual photon, passing through the set up will place itself on the second 
wall in such a position that when enough have passed through they have 
collectively built up an interference pattern, when there cannot possibly be 
any interference!</p> 
<p>If we repeat the experiment, this time with only one hole open, the 
individual photons behave again like bullets and all cluster round a point on 
the detector screen directly behind the open hole, just as expected. However, 
as soon as the second hole is opened they again immediately start to form an 
interference pattern. An individual photon passing through one of the holes is 
not only aware of the other hole, but also aware of whether or not it is open! 
We could try peeking, to see which hole the photon goes through, and to see if 
it goes through both holes at once, or if half a photon goes through each hole. 
When detectors are placed at the holes to record the passage of electrons 
through each of the holes, the result is even more bizarre.</p> 
<p>Imagine an arrangement that records which hole a photon goes through but 
lets it pass on its way to the detector screen. Now the photons behave like 
normal, everyday particles. We always see a photon at one hole or the other, 
never both at once, and now the pattern that builds up on the detector screen 
is exactly equivalent to the pattern for bullets, with no trace of 
interference. Strangely, we do not need to even place detectors at both holes; 
we get the same result by watching just one hole. If a photon passes through a 
hole that does not have a detector, it not only knows if the other hole is open 
or not, it knows if the other hole is being observed! With no detector at the 
either hole, it will produce an interference pattern (wave), otherwise, with 
detectors at either one or both holes, it will act as a particle.</p> 
<p>Summary:<br>
&#61623; When we are watching the holes, we never catch the 
photon going through both at once--it will only go through one or the other, 
like particles.<br>
&#61623; When we are not watching the holes, the photon 
goes through both simultaneously, like a wave!</p> 
<p>Somehow the interaction of the observer with the experiment affects the 
observed result. When we try to look at the spread-out photon wave, it 
collapses into a definite particle, but when we are not looking it keeps its 
spread out wavy nature. Weird!<br>
What the double-slit experiment demonstrates 
is this: Each photon starts out as a single photon - a particle - and arrives 
at the detector on the second wall as a particle, but appears to have gone 
through both holes at once, interfered with itself, and worked out just where 
to place itself on the detector to make its own small contribution to the 
overall interference pattern. This observation raises a number of significant 
problems! Does the photon go through both holes at the same time? How can a 
single photon go through two holes at the same time? How does it 
&ldquo;know&rdquo; where to go on the detector to form part of the overall 
pattern?</p> 
<p>Perhaps the bizarre experimental results are due to the unusual properties 
of photons themselves. After all photons are massless ephemeral objects and 
might have other hitherto undiscovered strange properties. However, it turns 
out electrons have been used instead of photons, and they not only have mass, 
they have an electric charge, and even move at different speeds depending on 
circumstances, much like normal everyday objects. The double-slit experiments 
still gives the same result using electrons as it does using photons; electrons 
also alter their behavior depending on whether or not they are being observed. 
The experiment has even been performed using atoms and even small molecules 
large enough to be individually photographed, again with the same result. These 
are very real solid objects and this odd behavior of particles is a very real 
phenomenon.</p> 
<p><strong>The Return of the Mind</strong></p> 
<p>These next two paragraphs are the hardest to grasp in this entire article 
so prepare yourself. The currently accepted interpretation for quantum 
weirdness concerns the nature of the wave that is passing through the 
experiment. The key concept of the theory, which forms a central part of the 
Copenhagen Interpretation of quantum mechanics, is known as the 'collapse of 
the wave function'. The theory seeks to explain how an entity such as a photon 
or an electron, could 'travel as a wave but arrive as a particle'. According to 
the theory, what is passing through the holes in a double-slit experiment is 
not a normal material wave at all, but is a 'probability wave'. In other words, 
the particle does not have a definite location, but has a probability of being 
here or there, or somewhere else entirely. Some locations will be more probable 
than others, such as the light areas in the interference pattern for example, 
and some will be less probable, such as in the dark areas.</p> 
<p>In this theory, an electron that is not being observed does not exist as a 
particle at all, but has a wave-like property covering all the areas of 
probability where it could be found. Until it is observed, it exists 
simultaneously in two or more places at the same time! The technical quantum 
mechanical term for this is that the electron is in a &ldquo;superposition 
state&rdquo;. Once the electron is observed, the &lsquo;wave function 
collapses&rsquo; into a single location and the electron becomes a particle. 
Mathematically, &lsquo;collapse&rsquo; means that the probability becomes 
&lsquo;one&rsquo; for a single location and &lsquo;zero&rsquo; for all others. 
This theory elegantly explains the behavior of the particles in the double-slit 
experiment. When we are not looking at the particle, the probability wave, of 
even a single particle, is spread out and will pass through both slits at the 
same time and arrive at the detector as a wave showing an interference pattern. 
When we observe the electron by placing detectors at the slits, it is forced 
into revealing its location which causes the probability wave to collapse into 
a particle. If the theory is correct, its implications are staggering. What it 
suggests is that<strong><em> nothing is real until it has been consciously 
observed!</em></strong></p> 
<p><em>Nothing is real until it has been consciously observed</em>! Are we 
really saying that until a thing has been observed it doesn't exist? This is 
precisely what the Copenhagen Interpretation is telling us about reality. The 
central role of the perceiving mind in the paradigm of quantum physics suggests 
a new philosophical outlook on the relationship between the mind and the 
universe. Quantum physics reinstated the human mind to the central position it 
had in the early Vedic world concept. This has caused philosophers and some 
scientists to ponder the cosmological implications. This could imply that there 
must actually be something 'outside' the known universe to observe it as a 
whole and collapse its overall wave function. Another argument that it is in 
fact the conscious observation of living beings that has collapsed the wave 
function and brought the universe into existence. If we take this to be true, 
then the universe only exists because we are looking at it. But if you&rsquo;ve 
read this far maybe you&rsquo;ve already guessed: this is not quite the end of 
the story, though it took another eighty years after Thomas&rsquo;s double-slit 
extravaganza.</p> 
<p><strong>What's the photoelectric effect?</strong></p> 
<p>In 1887 Heinrich Hertz determined experimentally that when light shines on 
a metal surface, it&rsquo;s surface emits electrons. In fact you can actually 
start an electric current in a circuit just by shining a light on a metal 
plate. How does this happen? When light hits electrons in the atoms of the 
metal&rsquo;s surface, it can transfer enough energy to knock some of these 
electrons out of its atoms.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Historically, light had been viewed by some as a particle rather than a 
wave; Newton, as we&rsquo;ve said,<br>
thought of light this way. However this 
particle view was pretty much discredited with Thomas Young's double-slit 
experiment, which demonstrated that light had to be a wave. But in the early 
20th century, some physicists--Einstein, for one&mdash;began to consider the 
particle view of light again. Einstein used the photoelectric effect to 
understand whether light consists of particles or waves.</p> 
<p>It may at first seem that the photoelectric effect would still occur no 
matter which view is correct. Either way, the light would carry energy, so it 
would be able to knock electrons around. But the<em>details</em> of the 
photoelectric effect are completely different depending on whether light 
consists of particles or waves.</p> 
<p>If light is a wave, then the energy contained in one of those waves should 
depend only on its amplitude--that is, on the intensity (brightness) of the 
light. The light&rsquo;s frequency (color), should make no difference. So, for 
example, red light and ultraviolet light of the same intensity should knock out 
the same number of electrons, and the maximum kinetic energy of both sets of 
electrons should also be the same. Decrease the intensity (brightness), and you 
should get fewer electrons, flying out more slowly; if the light is too faint, 
you shouldn't get any electrons at all, no matter what frequency you're using.
</p> 
<p>That may sound reasonable enough to you at this point. Now let&rsquo;s see 
how the effect change would if we assume that light is made of particles.</p> 
<p>First we need to briefly understand the work of Max Planck...<br>
In 1900, 
Max Planck was working on the problem of how the radiation an object emits is 
related to its temperature. He came up with a formula that agreed very closely 
with experimental data, but the formula only made sense if he assumed that the 
energy of a vibrating molecule was quantized--that is, it could only take on 
certain discreet values in discreet steps. The energy emitted was found to be 
proportional to the frequency of vibration, and it seemed to come in little 
&quot;chunks&quot; of the frequency multiplied by a certain constant. This 
constant came to be known as Planck's constant, or h, and it has the value 
6.62606957(29)&times;10&minus;34 joule sec., an extremely small but important 
value.<br>
Planck actually didn't realize how revolutionary his work was at the 
time but Albert Einstein did. Einstein proposed that not only radiation but 
light also delivers its energy in chunks. Einstein proposed that light consists 
of little particles, or quanta, later named photons, each with an energy equal 
to Planck's constant times its frequency, E=hf.<br>
<br>
So in the case of 
light being photon particles, the frequency of the light would make a 
difference in the photoelectric effect. Higher-frequency photons have more 
energy, so they should make the electrons come flying out faster. Now keeping 
the intensity (brightness) of the light the same but using a higher frequency 
(color) should increase the maximum kinetic energy of the emitted electrons. 
But if you leave the frequency the same but crank up the intensity, more 
electrons should come out (because there are more photons to hit them), but 
they won't come out any faster, because each individual photon still has the 
same energy. And if the frequency is low enough, then none of the photons will 
have enough energy to knock an electron out of an atom. So if you use really 
low-frequency light, you shouldn't get any electrons, no matter how high the 
intensity is. Whereas if you use a high frequency, you should still knock out 
some electrons even if the intensity is very low, i.e. very dim!</p> 
<p>Which way did it turn out?<br>
Frequency and not intensity is the important 
factor. In 1913 R.A. Millikan in a series of extremely meticulous experiments 
proved that Einstein's predictions about light being composed of photon 
particles were correct. The extraordinary fact that the ejection energy was 
independent of the total energy of illumination (i.e. intensity) showed that 
the effect must be due to a particle which gave all of its energy to the 
electron! (Einstein actually won the Nobel Prize for his work on the 
photoelectric effect, not for his more famous theory of relativity)<br>
But if 
light is made of particles what about the double-slit experiment? It proves 
beyond all possible doubt that light consists of waves. Depending on which 
experiment you choose to do, you can prove light to be either particles 
(photoelectric experiment) or waves (double-slit experiment).</p> 
<p>Thus was quantum mechanics born from this conundrum and from the ensuing 
research of Einstein, Planck, de Broglie, Bohr, Schr&ouml;dinger, Bell and 
others who attempted to explain how electromagnetic radiation can exhibit both 
particle-like and wave-like behavior. Precisely because quantum mechanics leads 
to irrefutably proven yet outrageously counter-intuitive and illogical 
conclusions that it has perhaps perfectly prepared the world for the true 
renaissance of Ayurveda. In order to change a prevailing scientific paradigm as 
entrenched as classical materialistic worldview, we need evidence powerful and 
earth-shattering enough to create sufficient cognitive dissonance to admit the 
possibility of another entirely different worldview. Once also 
counter-intuitive, we no longer believe that the sun and planets revolve around 
the earth or that the earth is flat. In September 2011 there was even a 
preliminary report from the esteemed CERN laboratory of an object&mdash;a muon 
neutrino&mdash;moving faster than the speed of light, which for 100 years has 
been held to be an immutable, unsurpassable constant (final confirmation may 
take several years). Perhaps the time has come, thanks to quantum mechanics, 
when we will no longer fear the mockery and disdain of the rational 
materialists as we open our minds once again to the validity of the original 
intuitive revelations and insights of Ayurveda.</p> 
<p><strong>Quantum Entanglement</strong></p> 
<p>There is another aspect of quantum mechanics which has equally astonishing 
implications.<br>
Atoms can be raised to an excited state from which they 
quickly return to their ground state in two successive quantum jumps and in so 
doing, they release two photons. These two &ldquo;twin photons&rdquo; will fly 
off in different directions but will always have the same polarization (i.e. 
both vertical, both horizontal, etc.) when they are measured. Until the 
polarization is actually measured, photons have no polarization. Now if one 
photon from a twin pair is measured and found to have vertical polarization, 
its twin&mdash;though it could be many miles away or even in another 
galaxy&mdash;will exhibit the same polarization, even though the second photon 
could not have possibly received any information about the polarization of the 
first photon. Twin pair photons are entangled in a state of identical 
polarization but do not have any particular polarization unless and until one 
of them is measured. Prior to measurement, the polarization of both photons is 
identical but in a superposition state. Measurement of one of the separated 
pairs instantaneously collapses both photons to the same polarization.</p> 
<p>If the objects are indeterminate until one of them is measured, then the 
question becomes, &quot;How can we account for an initially indefinite 
direction of polarization in twin #2 suddenly becoming definite in concert with 
twin #1 even though no physical interaction between them occurred, and which 
are sufficiently separated that there was not even sufficient time, if we take 
c, the speed of light to be a limit, for such an interaction to proceed from 
the first to the second object?&quot; The answer to the latter question is 
counterintuitive, breathtaking, and also repeated proven to be true. 
We&rsquo;ve stated it above but it bears repeating. Twin pair photons do not 
have any specific polarization or any property until one of them is consciously 
observed. It is the observation of the polarization of one to be, say, 
vertically polarized that instantaneously collapses both photons to that same 
vertical polarization. This leads to two irrefutable conclusions:<br>

One&mdash;the properties and behavior of a single member of a photon twin-pair 
is spontaneously connected to its twin. This applies not only to photons but to 
any two objects that have ever interacted; they are eternally entangled and 
will have mutual influence on each other&rsquo;s behavior. By the way, this 
entanglement even exists if two objects have a common interaction with a third 
object. Thus it points to a universal connectedness reminiscent of that spoken 
of in the Vedas.<br>
Two-- that there is no physical reality to any physical 
property until it is consciously observed.</p> 
<p><strong>Quantum Mechanics and the Tanmatras</strong></p> 
<p>In almost all modern textbooks detailing the philosophical origins of 
Ayurveda darshan, we find a few paragraphs outlining the Samkhya philosophy. 
Texts commonly include a flow diagram of the 24 tattvas revealing the 
procession of the creation from immaterial to material, from Purusha (Spirit) 
to the Panchamahabhutas (Matter). The five Tanmatras appear in the procession 
as the final immaterial element immediately preceding and creating the five 
material gross elements.</p> 
<p>It is here, in the attempts to explain to movement from Tanmatra to 
Mahabhuta that modern authors&rsquo; voices suddenly become silent. For modern 
authors of Ayurveda know nothing of this moment where consciousness acquires 
the appearance of a material substance; where the microcosmic realm of Spirit, 
Thought, and Ideas are transformed into the mundane, solid, tangible 
macroscopic realm of material objects. That the interface of the Tanmatras and 
Mahabhutas was an important and mysterious process is clear from its 
consideration in ancient Vedic texts such as the Brahmanda Purana:<br>
Mano 
rupeksu kodanda panchatanmatra sayaka &ldquo;Mind is the bow which launches the 
arrows as five Tanmatras&rdquo;</p> 
<p>The Tanmatras are the contribution of the conscious mind to material 
reality. Quantum mechanics shines its light on this mystifying boundary where 
we are learning that these two apparently distinct realities are truly one. The 
external world is a fabrication, a combining, not only of particles and waves, 
but of realities. The mind creates Maya. It paints the image of a material 
world upon the canvas of Brahman, the unfathomable eternal substratum of 
everything. The illusion of Maya is slowly dissolving as quantum mechanics 
leads us toward the integration of mind, matter, events, consciousness, thought 
and intuition into one ultimate source.</p> 
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p> 
<p>Thousands of years ago the ancient Vedic priests and Ayurvedic healers 
realized the fundamental truth that the entire universe is one, interconnected 
life interpenetrated by the ultimate reality which they named Brahman. Perhaps 
the most central Vedic teaching is that everything including all human beings 
are born from Brahman which manifests its connection with us in the form of our 
individual atman. Their insights were eventually recorded in the Vedas and the 
essence of these realizations more cogently expressed in the Upanishads. In the 
Brhadaranyaka Upanishad the sage Yajnavalkya declares &ldquo;That Reality, O 
Gargi, has interpenetrated the whole universe.&rdquo; The Munduka Upanishad 
begins with a student&rsquo;s question to his guru: &ldquo;By what, O adorable 
Sir, having become known, all this is known?&rdquo; A lengthy series of 
questions repeatedly seeking kasmin (by what) is steadfastly answered by the 
emphatic assertion yasmin (by That)&mdash;which is Brahmin. Quantum mechanics, 
specifically its entanglement feature, gives scientific credence to the 
interconnection between Brahmin and all life forms. Everything that can be 
apprehended is but one part of a single universal entity. We needed quantum 
mechanics to be discovered by Humankind to shake off our materialist paradigm 
and re-mind us of this. Brahmin has always been described as the pure, 
uninvolved Witness to the creation. Quantum mechanics verifies the universal 
creative implications of the observer. Perhaps now a new non-denominational 
version of the bible could be re-written in light of the convergence of 
Quantum-Vedic wisdom outlined in this paper. It could be called The Tentative 
Gospel According to Quantum Veda. It could begin, &ldquo;In the beginning there 
was the probability wave. And it was Brahmin&rdquo;. And from there, it would 
be only a small step back to our Ayurvedic roots.</p> <br>
