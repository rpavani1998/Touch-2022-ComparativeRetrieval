<h2>  Chinese Medicine Provides Hope for Fertility Challenges </h2>

<p><em>By Neil Weinberg<br>
 When the soil is well-prepared, the harvest will 
be bountiful.</em><br>
 &#150;Ancient Chinese Proverb<br>
<br>
 Anna sat 
lovingly holding her newborn baby girl in my office. Tired but ecstatic, she 
was overjoyed to finally be a mother.&nbsp; Discouraged for years after a 
diagnosis of &#147;unexplained infertility,&#148; it was only out of 
desperation (and an acute awareness that her biological &#147;window of 
opportunity&#148; was short) that she decided to try an &#147;alternative 
cure.&#148; She had given up all hope of ever becoming pregnant and her 
conventional health practitioners had given up as well. Now, a little over a 
year later she came in to have me hold her daughter.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><br>
</p> 
<p><br>
 Infertility is defined as the inability to conceive after one year of 
unprotected intercourse or the inability to carry a pregnancy to term. The 
prevalence of infertility has been increasing dramatically over the past few 
decades. There are many theories as to why couples are increasingly finding 
conception difficult.&nbsp; Among these are an increase in hormones in food and 
the environment, toxins in food, air and water, and delayed maternal age.&nbsp; 
Regardless of the causes, more and more couples are seeking assistance with 
fertility issues. Some prefer to utilize the services of fertility clinics 
(whose numbers have skyrocketed in recent years as the technology of assisted 
reproductive technology (ART) has advanced) and/or use fertility drugs.&nbsp; 
Others prefer a more gentle, holistic approach&#150;utilizing herbs, 
supplements, and lifestyle modifications. In addition, as research documenting 
the efficacy of Chinese medicine in treating infertility continues to mount, 
ever increasing numbers of people are choosing this therapeutic method, either 
by itself or in combination with western allopathic treatments such as in vitro 
fertilization (IVF).</p> 
<p><br>
 Although the use of acupuncture and Chinese herbal medicine to help 
with reproductive imbalances for both men and women goes back more than two 
thousand years, recent research has presented concrete evidence of its 
benefits. One example of this appeared in the April 2002 issue of Fertility and 
Sterility which presented a well-designed, controlled study that demonstrated 
positive results for dramatically increasing success rates for couples 
undergoing IVF treatments. Women who were treated with acupuncture immediately 
before and after embryo transfer had significantly higher rates of successful 
implantation. Not fully understood from a western perspective, it is suggested 
that the ability of acupuncture to increase blood flow throughout the body as 
well as its ability to affect the autonomic nervous system, reducing 
contractions at the time of implantation creates conditions that &#147;optimize 
endometrial receptivity.&#148;</p> 
<p> Other potential benefits include: improved ovarian blood flow, increased 
ovarian response, and thickening of the endometrial lining. Among the many 
medical conditions related to fertility, which can benefit from acupuncture 
treatment are low sperm count, poor ovarian response, luteal phase defect and 
tubal spasm. Research evidence supporting the benefits of acupuncture treatment 
is so strong that many fertility clinics are employing acupuncturists as part 
of their medical team, or making referrals to them to help maximize the 
reproductive health of their patients and increase their success rates.</p> 
<p><br>
 I have witnessed extremely positive results in my clinical fertility 
treatment experience. In many cases, women who have been unsuccessful for years 
have become pregnant within a relatively short period of time with acupuncture 
and Chinese herbal therapy. Regardless of the complexities of the conditions, 
the goal of treatment from a Chinese perspective is always the same; to restore 
balance to the system and create an ideal environment in which an embryo can 
thrive. Metaphorically, this is akin to preparing the soil in a garden in the 
fall prior to planting seeds in the spring. Acupuncture and herbs provide the 
water and nutrients and optimize the conditions for optimal germination and 
growth.</p> 
<p><br>
 Two recent successful cases are described below:</p> 
<p><br>
 Sandra is a 38 year-old woman who was recently married. After two 
years of failing to become pregnant, she decided to try acupuncture on the 
recommendation of a close friend who I had helped to achieve a healthy 
pregnancy. We first worked on regulating her menstrual cycles, which were 
irregular, short in duration and light in flow. She implemented some minor 
lifestyle and dietary changes, and began to take a daily herbal formula and had 
weekly acupuncture treatments. During the following three cycles her periods 
began to normalize and following the completion of her fourth cycle she became 
pregnant.&nbsp; She is now the happy mother of a healthy one-year-old daughter.
</p> 
<p><br>
 Patti and Jim had several factors working against them.&nbsp; His 
sperm count and motility were both sub-optimal and she was diagnosed with 
polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) and did not ovulate regularly. As is a 
typical pattern, she started treatment first, started feeling better and 
convinced her husband to start therapy with herbs and acupuncture as well. 
Theirs was not an easy road.&nbsp; It took over a year of treatment and a 
miscarriage but it did ultimately have a happy ending. They are now proud 
parents of a healthy son.</p> 
<p><br>
 While not every treatment ends in a successful pregnancy, many do, 
and often these are cases in which the individuals had given up hope of ever 
becoming parents. As you might imagine, this is gratifying beyond words for all 
involved. Chinese medicine can provide renewed hope and results, for those 
hopelessly mired in the diagnosis and despair of infertility.<br>

<li> ICSD Switches to Compostable Lunch Trays <br>

<p> <i>By Kristie Snyder, <br>
 GreenLeaf Editor</i> </p> 
<p> When Pam Wooster&rsquo;s daughter came home from school and asked her if 
she knew that the kids used disposable styrofoam lunch trays, she was appalled. 
She knew that after their 20-minute useful lifespan was over they would just 
end up in the trash, so she decided to take action. Two years later, the Ithaca 
City School District&rsquo;s (ICSD) Food Service Program has switched to 
compostable trays and reduced its trash by 73 percent.</p>
