<h3><b>The Biomedical Basis of Holistic Acupuncture</b></h3> 
<p>by Andrew Pacholyk, MS, L.Ac. </p>
<p><b>Abstract</b><br>
 In trying to find ways to unite or just bring closer 
the mysterious transformational techniques of the East to the reductionism 
theories of the West, our Western medical science has tried to organize a 
logical explanation of how the insertion of tiny acupuncture needles can reduce 
and even dissolve pain in the human form.This research takes a look at the 
different approaches the Biosciences have attempted in explaining the way 
holistic acupuncture works in healing. This research will take a look at the 
biochemical, biomechanical, as well as bio-electromagnetic theories that have 
been developed in trying to explain the healing aspects of the Ancient Art of 
Acupuncture.<br>

<b>
The Ancient Art of Acupuncture</b> is the needling of specific points along 
&quot;meridians&quot; or channels that run throughout our body. Acupuncture can 
be traced back as far as the Stone Age in China, when stone knives and pointed 
rocks were used to relieve pain and diseases. &quot;These instruments were 
known by the ancients as &quot;bian&quot; In the Han Dynasty (206 BC to 220 AD) 
an Analytical Dictionary of Characters &quot;Shuo Wen Jie Zi&quot; describes 
the character &quot;bian&quot; as meaning a stone to treat disease.&quot;(1) 
Later these stones were replaced by needles made of bamboo and slivers of 
animal bone, then finally in the Shang Dynasty bronze casting techniques made 
metal needles possible, which conducted electricity and Qi. This led to the 
mapping of the meridian system or channels of energy within the body.<br>
<br>
 
Acupuncture remained relatively unheard of until 1974 when James Reston, a 
reporter for the New York Times accompanied President Nixon on a trip to China 
where they witnessed an appendectomy and several demonstrations of serious 
surgeries being performed with acupuncture as the only anesthetic using 
Acupuncture Anesthesia. Despite many efforts to prove it's efficiency, Western 
science has never been able to reconcile how Acupuncture works. They can prove 
&quot;that&quot; it works, but not &quot;how&quot; it works.<br>
<br>
<b>
Biochemical theories</b><br>
 Most of the scientific studies of acupuncture 
have been centered on the analgesic aspects of pain relief. Acupuncture is 
definitely effective in treating pain; it works 70% to 80% of the time, far 
greater than the placebo, which only has about 30% efficiency. (2) The problem 
with attributing all of acupuncture's effects to the placebo effect, which is 
based on a &quot;suggestive way&quot; or the fact that one just wants to 
believe that it works, was the fact that veterinarians in China have used 
acupuncture successfully to treat animals. (3)</p>
<p> Dr. Bruce Promeranz, working at the University of Toronto, was very 
involved in research done on acupuncture analgesia. By activating small 
myelinated nerve fibers, acupuncture applications send impulses to the spinal 
chord, midbrain and pituitary-hypothalamus in the diencephelon. (4) 
Neurological research done in the late 70's discovered the naturally occurring 
chemicals in the body known as endorphins. (5) By binding to the opiate 
receptors that are found throughout the nervous system, endorphins are able to 
stop pain. The hypothalamus-pituitary releases Beta-endorphins into the blood 
and cerebral spinal fluid to create an analgesic effect by causing incoming 
pain signals from reaching the brain. Pomeranz discovered that pre-treating 
rats with a drug called Naloxone, a drug known to block the healing endorphins, 
could not achieve acupuncture pain relief. This finding suggested that 
endorphin release caused by acupuncture stimulus was an important mechanism 
behind acupuncture's pain relieving effects.</p>
<p> Pomeranz was then interested in the effects of electrical stimulation and 
manipulation of acupuncture needles. What he also discovered was the difference 
between high frequency, low intensity vs. low frequency, high intensity 
application.<br>
<br>
<b>The low frequency, high intensity</b> produced an 
analgesic effect which was slower at the onset but longer in duration and also 
having cumulative effects. Therefore, repeated treatments produce more and more 
benefits for the patient.<br>
<br>
<b>The high frequency, low intensity</b> 
produced a very rapid analgesic effect, which is great for acute pain but 
shorter in duration with no cumulative effects. (6)<br>
<br>
 There are 
presently 100 different neurotransmitters and neuroendocrine substances in the 
body, of which the endorphins constitute only one class. (7) Hence, there is 
much work to be done in testing and researching these chemicals and their 
possible effects with acupuncture.<br>
<br>
<b>Biomechanical theories</b><br>
 
The biomechanical questions had to do with the presents of meridians in the 
body. These are the channels in the body, which are filled with our life force, 
energy &iuml;&iquest;&frac12; Qi. The meridians are said to circulate Qi 
throughout the system of the body. In an attempt to locate the meridians 
anatomically, two French Drs. Claude Darras and Pierre De Vernejoul injected 
human studies with radioactive isotopes into acupuncture points. A solution of 
an ionic salt of technetium was injected and followed over a period of time 
with a gamma ray camera. The radioactive technetium followed the exact same 
pathways of the meridian channels described and illustrated in several 
hundred-year-old acupuncture charts of the human body! (8) To ensure that the 
Drs. were measuring meridians and not blood vessels or lymphatic channels, some 
patients received technetium injections adjacent to non-acupoint skin regions 
as well as in nearby blood and lymphatic channels. The radioactive tracers 
tended to diffuse outward from the injection site into a typical small circular 
pattern. (9)</p>
<p> In 1975, Dr. Liu YK researched the location of acupoints present at sites 
of motor nerves. His work realized that acupoints correspond to regions where 
motor nerves enter skeletal muscle and where there is a great density of motor 
nerve terminal elements at the surface. As well, there was found to be dense 
clusters of encapsulated autonomic nerve mechanoreceptor sites at these points. 
(10) Further research was done on Dr. Liu's work. Dr. Watari published a report 
in Beijing, China in November 1987, based on his work. He found that 
histologically, volume density of corresponding acupoints to blood vessels are 
elevated fourfold and that of nerves 1.4 times over that of surrounding 
tissues. These vessels and fibers mingle to form glomerular structures. (11)<br>
<br> This was exciting new biomechanical evidence in both identifying the 
meridian channels in the human body and the fact that the acupuncture points on 
the body have corresponding volume densities that increase with stimulation.<br>
<br> <b>Bio-electromagnetic theories</b><br>
 Science has long been aware of an 
electrical phenomenon called the &quot;Current of Injury&quot;.This happens 
when tissue in the body undergoes trauma or microscopic damage to an area of 
skin. When skin cells are pierced, as with an acupuncture needle, they start 
leaking electrically charged ions into the surrounding areas of tissue. A weak 
electrical battery-like charge is created. This electric current is called the 
current of injury, which is know to stimulate a healing response from the 
nearby cells. This does not explain how stimulating acupoints with low level, 
non-invasive lasers could achieve the same therapeutic effects. (12)<br>
<br>
 
The electrical conductivity of acupoints has been known for several decades 
thanks to the work of Nakatani in the 1950s and by Dr. Robert Becker in the 
1970s. Becker's work on the Large Intestine and the Pericardium meridians found 
that the points along these channels showed significantly more electrical 
conductivity than areas of skin with non-acupoints.<br>
<br>
 In 1986 German 
scientist Fritz-Albert Popp and Chinese biologist, Chang-Lin Zhang developed a 
model they called the &quot;Standing Wave Superposition Hypothesis&quot;. This 
research attempts to accommodate the holographic nature of acupuncture such as 
the homunculus or miniature representation of the whole body represented in the 
ears and the feet. The theory also strives to explain the anomalous skin 
resistance properties of acupuncture points as well as the apparent 
interconnectivity between them. (13)<br>
<br>
<b>In the Zhang-Popp model</b>, 
it is shown that the body is composed of sodium, potassium and other 
electrically charged inorganic ions such as proteins and DNA which when 
accelerated will emit EM radiation in accordance with conventional physical 
theory. With these many types of charges oscillating in the body, an 
interference pattern is produced formed by the various waves of various 
wavelengths.<br>
<br>
 The highest combination of wave amplitudes forms the 
acupuncture points and meridians by means of constructive interference. At 
these points the skin is at the highest in electrical conductivity. This 
conductivity depends on the internal electrical field, which is determined by 
the interference pattern from the superposition of the numerous waves. (14) 
Hence, the standing wave pattern of a sick person would have a varied pattern 
from that of a healthier person. The treatment of acupuncture with needles in 
the acupoints would cause a disturbance in the standard wave pattern caused by 
new boundaries formed by the needle. The needle activates the current of injury 
response resulting in a change in the EM field, producing changes in the 
biological response, which may promote healing. It is this theory, which 
implicates the EM fields of the entire body.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>The principle of 
the Connective Tissue Continuum</b> is another approach at viewing the 
correlation of acupuncture to the bio-electromagnetic theory. From a cellular 
level through to the bodies' connective tissue, these living organisms are 
considered a continuum. Not only is the entire cell now known to be 
mechanically and electrically interconnected in a &quot;solid state&quot; (15), 
but, all the cells in the body are in turn interconnected to one another via 
the connective tissues (16).<br>
<br>
 The function of connective tissues is to 
keep the body organized, acting as a lace work between the major organs and 
tissues, to strengthen the wall of arteries, veins, intestines and pathways and 
to provide fascia and the skeletal structure attachment to the muscles. It is 
believed that connective tissues may be largely responsible for the rapid 
intercommunication that enables our body to function effectively as a coherent 
whole, and is therefore central to our health and well-being. Recent studies 
with Nuclear Magnetic Resonance has shown that the muscles in living human 
subjects provide evidence of a &quot;liquid-crystalline-like&quot; structure 
(17). Liquid crystals usually undergo rapid changes in phases or transitions 
when exposed to electromagnetic fields. Liquid crystals will also respond to 
changes in temperature, hydration, pressure and shear forces. Biological liquid 
crystals carry static electric charges and are influenced by pH, salt 
concentration and dielectric constant of the solvent.<br>
<br>
 There are many 
types of liquid crystals, from those which are most liquid, to those which are 
most solid. Those that are most liquid can flow as water does, and even though 
all molecules tend to be aligned in one direction, individual molecules can 
move very freely and change places with each other while maintaining their 
common orientation. The ones that resemble solid crystal will have order and 
will remain flexible and responsive. It is already widely recognized that all 
the major constituents of living organisms may be liquid crystal such as lipids 
of cellular membranes, DNA, possibly all proteins, especially cytoskeletal 
proteins, muscle proteins, and proteins in the connective tissues such as 
collagens and proteoglycans (18). It is through this &quot;liquid network&quot; 
that scientist believe an acupuncture response is solicited.<br>
<br>
<b>In 
conclusion</b><br>
 By looking at the Bioscience attempts in explaining the way 
holistic acupuncture works in healing, we are introduced to some very notable 
concepts. Observing the biochemical view, we see, by Pomeranz research, that 
the hypothalamus-pituitary releases Beta-endorphins into the blood and cerebral 
spinal fluid to create an analgesic effect by causing incoming pain signals 
from reaching the brain. The low frequency, high intensity produced an 
analgesic effect which was slower at the onset but longer in duration and also 
having cumulative effects. Therefore, repeated treatments produce more and more 
benefits for the patient. The high frequency, low intensity produced a very 
rapid analgesic effect, great for acute pain but, shorter in duration with no 
cumulative effects.</p>
<p> Biomechanically, Drs. Claude Darras and Pierre De Vernejoul injected human 
studies with radioactive isotopes into acupuncture points. A solution of an 
ionic salt of technetium was injected and followed over a period of time with a 
gamma ray camera. The radioactive technetium followed the exact same pathways 
of the meridian channels described and charted in several hundred-year-old 
acupuncture charts of the human body! Dr. Liu YK researched the location of 
acupoints present at sites of motor nerves. His work realized that acupoints 
correspond to regions where motor nerves enter skeletal muscle and where there 
is a great density of motor nerve terminal elements at the surface.</p>
<p> Bio-electromagnetic theories are based on the Current Of Injury, which is 
know to stimulate a healing response from the nearby cells. The electrical 
conductivity of acupoints researched by Nakatani in the 1950s and by Dr. Robert 
Becker in the 1970s found that the points along the channels showed 
significantly more electrical conductivity than areas of skin with 
non-acupoints.</p>
<p> The Zhang-Popp model, shows us that the body is composed of sodium, 
potassium and other electrically charged inorganic ions such as proteins and 
DNA which when accelerated will emit EM radiation in accordance with 
conventional physical theory. The acupuncture needle activates the current of 
injury response resulting in a change in the EM field, producing changes in the 
biological response.</p>
<p> The Connective Tissue Continuum embraces the concept that the cytoskeletal 
structure of each individual cell in the body is a homunculus of the connective 
tissue in which it creates. Magnetic Resonance has shown that the muscles in 
living human subjects provide evidence of a &quot;liquid-crystalline-like&quot; 
structure. Liquid crystals usually undergo rapid changes in phases or 
transitions when exposed to electromagnetic fields. It is through this 
&quot;liquid network&quot; that scientist believe an electromagnetic response 
from acupuncture is solicited. This research represents much of the current 
biological views on how acupuncture heals and tries to explain the Biomedical 
Basis of Holistic Acupuncture.<br>

<h3><b>Acupuncture: Pre and Post Surgery</b></h3> 
<p>by Andrew Pacholyk, MS, L.Ac. </p>
<p>Acupuncture is very beneficial when it comes to pre and post surgery. No 
matter what the surgery is, the body perceives this as truama to the body. In 
turn, this trauma takes it's toll on the body in the way of stress. This stress 
caused by the surgery weakens the immune system, disruputes the 
gastrointestinal tract and leaves the body more vulnerable to infection.</p>
<p>Scientific evidence has shown that acupuncture stimulates the central 
nervous system, which is our brain and spinal chord. Acupuncture points are 
strategic conductors of electromagnetic signals. When these points are 
stimulated, they release endorphins, our natural pain killers in the body. 
Acupuncture has been shown to change our brain chemistry related to sensation, 
innvoluntary body functions and in turn, strengthens our immune system. 
Acupuncture regulates blood pressure, blood flow and body temperature.</p>
<p>Before surgery, we sometimes manifest symptoms in the form of physical 
pain, fatigue, tingling or numbness or most certainly stress and anxiety. Just 
thinking about the procedure can make us a nervous wreak. Acupuncture is very 
helpful during this time, since it helps to relieve anxiety, decrease pain 
symptoms that maybe occurring and strengthening the immune function. This gives 
us the advantage, even during surgery since acupuncture can regulate blood and 
body fluids.</p>
<p>After surgery, our bodies perceive this invasive procedure, as an attack. 
Our immune system is weakened, the gastrointestinal tract is comprimised and 
this leaves our bodies more vulnerable to infection. Acupuncture, post-surgery, 
can start as soon as possible. Acupuncture accelerates the healing process, 
increases the immune function, helps the body build more red blood cells and 
regulates blood, increase circulation of lymph and othe body fluids, regulates 
the gastrointestinal tract and relieves pain. Scar tissue is another factor 
with surgery. Usually two weeks after surgery, scar therapy with acupuncture 
needles can be done to help reduce the size as well as prevent keloid healing.
</p>
<p>Depending on the surgery, herbal medicine can be used to help speed up the 
recovery time and help reduce scarring, as well. Supplements that can boost the 
immune function and reduce infection include vitamins, minerals and amino acid.
</p>
<p>Glutamine is one of the most abundant amino acids in our bodies, found in 
the gastrointestinal tract. This amino acid is compromised when there is 
surgery or the immune function is low. Studies have shown that Glutamine is one 
of the best amino acid supplements after surgery.</p>
<p>Vitamins A, C and the B vitamins increase the immune function and help with 
wound healing.</p>
<p>Minerals such as Selenium help to stimulate immune function and fight 
infection, while Zinc enhances the immune system and assists in wound healing.
</p>
<p>So before and after you have surgery, consider having acupuncture and help 
your body to a speedy recovery!<br>

<h3><b>Acupuncture and Bell's Palsy</b></h3> 
<p>by Andrew Pacholyk MS, L.Ac. </p>
<p><b>Bell's palsy</b> is a form of facial paralysis resulting from damage to 
the VII (facial) cranial nerve. This nerve disorder afflicts approximately 
40,000 Americans each year. It can strike almost anyone at any age; however, it 
disproportionately attacks pregnant women and people who have diabetes, 
influenza, a cold, or some other upper respiratory ailment.</p>
<p>In addition to one-sided facial paralysis with possible inability to close 
the eye, symptoms of Bell's palsy may include pain, tearing, drooling, 
hypersensitivity to sound in the affected ear, and impairment of taste.</p>
<p><b>The common cold sore virus, herpes simplex virus (HSV)</b>, and other 
herpes viruses are the likely cause of many cases of Bell's palsy. HSV has been 
observed in saliva (Furuta, Fukuda et al. 1998) as well as muscle biopsy and 
tears (Kaygusuz, Godekmerdan et al. 2004) of Bell's palsy patients at 
significantly higher rates than control groups. One study found that 
approximately 50% of Bell's palsy patients show signs of the virus compared to 
approximately 19% of the normal population (Furuta, Fukuda et al. 1998). 
However, an opposing trial found HSV as well as VZV to be non-significantly 
represented in affected groups (Linder, Bossart et al. 2005). The life span of 
the virus and the timing of testing for HSV may explain these conflicting 
conclusions. Furuta (1998) discovered in his trial that HSV became undetectable 
after two weeks onset of Bell's palsy. The evidence suggesting HSV as the major 
cause of this condition is demonstrated further by the success of specific 
antiviral agents which have shown continued success against HSV infections 
(Adour, Ruboyianes et al. 1996; Allen and Dunn 2004; Allen and Dunn 2005). 
Furthermore, injections into rat specimens with HSV have recreated facial 
paralysis in approximate 50% of specimens (Gok, Alpay et al. 2005).</p>
<p><b>In Western medicine</b>, recent studies have shown that steroids are 
probably effective and that the drug acyclovir combined with prednisone is 
possibly effective in improving facial function. This is now the protocol of 
choice for Western doctors.</p>
<p><b>Other treatments</b> are usually aimed at protecting the eye from drying 
at nighttime. Some physicians may prescribe a corticosteroid drug to help 
reduce inflammation and an analgesic to relieve pain.</p>
<p><b>The prognosis for Bell's palsy is generally very good</b>. With the 
Western Medicine approach of drug treatment, most patients begin to get 
significantly better within 3-4 weeks, and about 80 percent recover completely 
within 3 months. For some, however, the symptoms may last longer. In a few 
cases, the symptoms may never completely disappear. The odds with 
electrostim-acupuncture are much higher. Treatment started with a week of the 
event, can improve the symptoms with 6 visits with complete recovery and normal 
facial symmetry within 12 -14 visits. The longer a persons goes without 
treatment, the longer the recovery time.</p>
<p><b>Acupuncture Therapy</b> </p>
<p><b>I treat Bell's Palsy in my practice all the time</b>, as acupuncture 
gets incredible results. My choice of protocol is electro-stimulation 
acupuncture. This effectively stimulates the facial nerves on a deeper level 
than TENS, electro-pads or anti-viral medications alone. I have found that 
approximately 12-14 treatments are needed to return the face back to its normal 
look and feel. This form of acupuncture stops pain, relaxes the facial 
paralysis, brings the feeling back through the nerve endings, stops the 
drooling and tearing and helps the eye close again. This protocol essentially 
returns the face back to normal in one-third the time of any other treatment I 
have seen for this disorder.</p>
<p><b>Bell's Palsy (Zhong Feng)</b> is considered a Wind Attack or External 
Wind Stroke attack. The main pattern differentiation being a Wind invasion due 
to emptiness of the Channels (Maclean and Lyttleton 1998). In Chinese Medicine, 
Wind is said to be the carrier of 1,000 diseases. Wind is thought to take 
advantage of the deficiency (weakness) a patient is experiencing and enters the 
body attacking the sinews and vessels in the area of the face. This results in 
vital energy (Qi) and the blood to stagnate causing the inability of the facial 
muscles to relax and therefore contract (Wolfe 2003). The principle of 
treatment is to expel Wind and promote the movement of Qi and blood by 
scattering the stagnation.</p>
<p><b>More times than not</b>, the patient that walks into my office is often, 
under great stress! They are either dealing with work related stress, having 
difficulties in their home or family life and are often the type A personality.
</p>
<p><b>As I work in the area of fertility</b>, it is the occasional pregnant 
patient that will present with this disorder, as well.</p>
<p><b>Patients who come in for treatment of Bell's Palsy</b> will often tell 
me they sleep with a fan on them (wind) or near an open window. I seem to get a 
flux of Bell's patients in the office in the Spring and Fall more than any 
other seasons.</p>
<p><b>Bell's Palsy is the most common disease of the facial nerve</b>. It is 
presumably due to an inflammatory reaction in or around the facial nerve near 
the stylomastoid foramen. According to Liu (1995), when acupuncture was 
initiated within three days postonset in 684 cases of facial nerve paralysis, 
100 percent of the patients were cured or there was a marked improvement (5). 
Other studies (Gao, Chen, 1991) revealed that 80% of cases that were treated at 
more than 2 months post-onset, and 83 percent of severe cases, were cured or 
had excellent effect (6). Treatment, as with this patient, may include numerous 
diagnostic procedures, different classes of medications, lifestyle alterations, 
and still, continued suffering. Acupuncture may often lead to significant 
clinical improvement (7).</p>
<p><b>Acupuncture points</b> used in this protocol include Stomach 2,3,4,5,6,7 
Bitong, Large Intestine 19, 20, Small intestine 18, Gall Bladder 14, 20, YuYao, 
San Jiao 17, Du 26, Du 20, Urinary Bladder 2, JiaChengJiang, Yintang, TaiYang, 
Stomach 36, Gall Bladder 34, Liver 3, Large Intestine 4, Lung 7, San Jiao 5 and 
Spleen 6.</p>
<p><b>Herbal Therapy</b> </p>
<p><b>For patients who are not pregnant</b>, an herbal formula is recommended 
based on their pattern and signs and symptoms. The most important herbs for 
this disorder should include herbs to treat wind attack and anti-viral herbs 
such as Qin Jiao, Fang Feng, Xi Xin, Bai Shao, Di Long, Fu Ling, Gan Cao, Chuan 
Xiong, Pu Gong Ying, Dang Gui.</p>
<p>Variations on this formula are important to change as the patient's 
situation change.</p>
<p><b>In conclusion</b>, Bell's palsy is a physical and emotionally 
debilitating condition in which conventional medicine has limited understanding 
and efficacy. The exposure to external sources (stress, environment) cause the 
immune system to produce an inflammatory response. This inflammation can then 
obstruct the normal function of the nerves and vessels resulting in paralysis. 
Chinese medicine has treated conditions such as Bell's palsy for centuries. 
Chinese medicine and acupuncture on a regular basis can significantly improve 
results and help to resolve this condition.</p>

<h3><b>Worlds AIDS Day: HIV and Alternative Medicine </b></h3> 
<p>by Andrew Pacholyk, MS, L.Ac. </p>
<p><b>The fact that there has to be a &quot;day&quot; for this disorder, 
saddens me</b>, yet it is appropriate for everyone to be more aware and that is 
why, as a society, we do this.</p>
<p><b>HIV is a virus</b>. Viruses infect the cells of living organisms and 
replicate (make new copies of themselves) within those cells. A virus can also 
damage human cells, which is one of the things that can make an infected 
creature become ill.</p>
<p><b>People can become infected with HIV</b> from other people who already 
have it, and when they are infected they can then go on to infect other people. 
Basically, this is how HIV is spread.</p>
<p>HIV stands for the <b>'Human Immunodeficiency Virus'</b>. Someone who is 
diagnosed as infected with HIV is said to be 'HIV+' or 'HIV positive'.</p>
<p><b>HIV Statistics</b> </p>
<p>*More than 25 million people have died of AIDS since 1981.<br>
 *Africa has 
12 million AIDS orphans.<br>
 *At the end of 2006, women accounted for 48% of 
all adults living with HIV worldwide, and for 59% in sub-Saharan Africa.<br>
 
*Young people (15-24 years old) account for half of all new HIV infections 
worldwide - around 6,000 become infected with HIV every day.<br>
 *In 
developing and transitional countries, 6.8 million people are in immediate need 
of life-saving AIDS drugs; of these, only 1.65 million are receiving the drugs.
<br> </p>
<p><b>Ways in which you can be infected with HIV</b> </p>
<p><b>-Unprotected</b> sexual intercourse with an infected person </p>
<p><b>-Sexual intercourse without a condom</b> is risky, because the virus, 
which is present in an infected person's sexual fluids, can pass directly into 
the body of their partner. This is true for unprotected vaginal and anal sex.
</p>
<p><b>-Oral sex carries a lower risk</b>, but again HIV transmission can occur 
here if a condom is not used - for example, if one partner has bleeding gums or 
an open cut, however small, in their mouth.</p>
<p><b>-Contact with blood</b> from an infected person. </p>
<p><b>-If sufficient blood from an infected person</b> enters the body of an 
uninfected person then it can pass on the virus.</p>
<p><b>-From mother to child</b>. HIV can be transmitted from an infected woman 
to her baby during pregnancy, delivery and breastfeeding. There are special 
drugs that can greatly reduce the chances of this happening, but they are 
unavailable in much of the developing world.</p>
<p><b>-Use of infected blood products</b>. Many people in the past have been 
infected with HIV by the use of blood transfusions and blood products which 
were contaminated with the virus - in hospitals, for example. In much of the 
world this is no longer a risk, as blood donations are routinely tested.</p>
<p><b>-Injecting drugs</b>. People who use illegal injected drugs are also 
vulnerable to HIV infection. In many parts of the world, often because it is 
illegal to possess them, injecting equipment or works are shared. A tiny amount 
of blood can transmit HIV, and can be injected directly into the bloodstream 
with the drugs.<br>
</p>
<p><b>It is not possible to become infected with HIV through</b>: </p>
<p>-sharing crockery and cutlery <br>
 -insect / animal bites <br>
 -touching, 
hugging or shaking hands<br>
 -eating food prepared by someone with HIV <br>
 
-toilet seats<br>
</p>
<p><b>Global statistics</b> can be found at: 
http://www.avert.org/worldstats.htm<br>
</p>
<p><b>Know Your Numbers</b> </p>
<p><b>Two numbers</b> should be looked at, when discussing HIV infection: </p>
<p><b>If you are being treated for HIV or AIDS</b>, your doctor uses a number 
of blood tests to check how you're doing. One of the most important tests 
measures<b>VIRAL LOAD</b>, the amount of HIV in your blood. Another very 
important test counts your<b>CD4 CELLS, sometimes called T-CELLS</b>. CD4 cells 
are a key part of your body's disease-fighting defenses, called the immune 
system.</p>
<p><b>CD4 cells</b> help to organize your body's defenses against disease. 
Doctors can take a sample of your blood and count the number of CD4 cells. 
Healthy adults and teenagers usually have a CD4 count of at least 800 cells per 
CUBIC MILLIMETER of blood (a cubic millimeter is a very small amount, roughly 
one small drop).</p>
<p><b>HIV attacks CD4 cells</b>, and as time goes by people with HIV often see 
their CD4 counts drop. The lower your CD4 count, the greater your chances of 
getting a number of very serious diseases. When your CD4 count is below 200, 
the risk of illness becomes severe.</p>
<p><b>Viral load tests</b>, which tell the doctor how much HIV is in your 
blood, are a very important clue to how quickly HIV is doing harm. These tests 
go by several different names, like PCR (polymerase chain reaction) or bDNA 
(branched DNA), but they all work roughly the same way. They count HIV's 
genetic material -- the building blocks of the virus. People with a high viral 
load are much more likely to get sick or die of AIDS than people with a low 
viral load.</p>
<p><b>Studies have shown</b> that when treatment reduces your viral load, it 
also reduces your chance of getting an AIDS-related infection or dying. 
Recently, a group of expert scientists reviewed 18 studies of anti-HIV drugs, 
which involved over 5,000 patients. Over and over again they found the same 
thing: The more viral load was reduced, the healthier the patients stayed.<br>

</p>
<p><b>Alternative Medicine and HIV</b> </p>
<p><b>Over the last decade</b>, researchers have identified a number of drugs 
that slow progression of the virus as well as therapies to treat the many 
opportunistic infections that attack people with HIV disease.</p>
<p><b>Although as yet, there is no cure</b>, the key to effective treatment is 
early detection and intervention. This is done by strengthening the immune 
system, reduce stress, maintain good nutritional practices and exercise as a 
way to relieve stress and boost your immune system.</p>
<p><b>Whether you have been diagnosed with HIV or not</b> there should be an 
emphasis on improving lifestyle issues. Taking control of or your life and 
taking an active role in any disorder is an important adjunct to treatment. 
Consideration of alternative therapies in conjunction with conventional 
medicine may offer additional opportunities for those living with HIV/AIDS to 
be proactive in their treatments.<br>
</p>
<p><b>Mind Medicine</b> </p>
<p>Stress is natural and affects your emotions. It can help you to deal with 
some situations. However, excessive stress can cause physical symptoms, it can 
damage your immune system and make you ill. Find ways of managing the stress in 
your life. Find ways to relax and recharge your batteries. Listen to your body; 
if you are tired, rest and you'll be better for it.</p>
<p>HIV can bring anxieties. One way of tackling these are through getting 
information, by learning about your condition, gaining confidence in it, in 
yourself and making informed choices for your future.</p>
<p><b>Boost Your Immune System with Meditation</b> </p>
<p><b>Fold your hands</b> gently in your lap and close your eyes. Take a few 
deep breaths. Then just sit. If you have never meditated before, you will 
probably feel as if your mind is full of thoughts. Don't try to stop the 
thoughts, just watch them. Imagine that you are on the bank of a river and that 
your thoughts are the river going by. Don't try to stop the river, just watch 
it. Within a week, you will see the river begin to slow down. You may become 
impatient, or even bored. That's okay. If you find yourself complaining, just 
watch the thoughts pass by. Do this for 5 to 10 minutes. You may find that you 
fall asleep because you are so relaxed. That's good because, in many ways, you 
have begun to let go. Continue at this pace and each day allow just alittle 
more time for yourself to meditate. Doing this allows you to relax and forget 
about time.</p>
<p><b>Consider these alternative therapies</b>: Acupuncture, ayurveda, 
bodywork &amp; massage, diet therapies, herbal medicine, homeopathy, mind-body 
therapies, Siddha medicine, traditional Chinese medicine, Unani medicine and 
yoga. </p>
<p><b>Herbs, Supplements and Vitamins Beneficial for HIV Infection</b> </p>
<p><b>Free radicals</b> are atoms or groups of atoms that have at least one 
unpaired electron, which makes them highly reactive. Free radicals promote 
beneficial oxidation that produces energy and kills bacterial invaders. 
However, in excess, they produce harmful oxidation or&quot;oxidative 
stress&quot; that can damage cell membranes and cell contents. These free 
radicals cause inflammation.</p>
<p><b>In human beings, free radicals are the natural by-products</b> of many 
processes within and among cells. Free radicals are created by exposure to 
various environmental factors, cigarette and tobacco smoke, air pollution, 
alcohol, drugs, radiation from televisions and computers, chemicals and a busy, 
stressful life.</p>
<p>Antioxidants are a classification of several organic substances, which 
include vitamins C and E, vitamin A (converted from beta- carotene), selenium, 
alpha lipoic acid, and carotenoids. Together as antioxidants, these substances 
are thought to be effective in helping to prevent certain cancers, 
cardiovascular disease, and cataracts. At the cellular level, antioxidants 
serve to deactivate certain free radicals in turn helping to decrease 
inflammation. The best source for antioxidants are in fruits and vegetables.
Acetyl-l-carnitine: is a molecule that occurs naturally in the brain, liver, 
and kidney. Natural levels of Acetyl-l-carnitine diminish as we age. 
Acetyl-l-carnitine is related to the amino acid L-Carnitine, which is a carrier 
of fatty acids across mitochondrial membranes, where energy is produced within 
each cell. N-Acetyl Cysteine (N-AC) is protective to Liver tissue and aids in 
breaking down excessive mucus.</p>
<p>Alpha Lipoic Acid: is a unique antioxidant that is both water and fat 
soluble, which allows it to enter all parts of the cell to neutralize free 
radicals. Alpha Lipoic Acid contributes to and is important for the production 
of energy inside the cell by utilizing sugar to produce energy contributing to 
mental and physical stamina, reducing muscle fatigue and neutralizes free 
radicals. Alpha Lipoic Acid recycles and enhances the effects of both Vitamin C 
and Vitamin E. Alpha Lipoic Acid targets liver protection and is helpful for 
patients on hepatotoxic medications such as antiretrovirals, antifungals and 
typically any long-term medication protocols. No known contraindications exist. 
Possible side effects include skin rash and the potential of hypoglycemia in 
diabetic patients. People who may be deficient in vitamin B1 (such as 
alcoholics) should take vitamin B1 along with alpha lipoic acid supplements.</p>
<p>Astragalus: is a Chinese herb that has been used for centuries for its 
immuno-modulating qualities. There is mixed scientific evidence on its efficacy 
with HIV, but well documented studies on its ability to stimulate the immune 
system. This herb is used often used in conjunction with other immune boosters 
such as reishi, maitake and shitake mushrooms.</p>
<p>Beta-carotene: (Carotenoids), of which beta-carotenes are the most popular, 
are found in many fruits and vegetables, animals, plants and microorganisms. 
The body converts beta carotene into Vitamin A. Vitamin A is a fat-soluble 
vitamin essential for vision, growth, cell division, reproduction and immunity. 
Among the 600 or more carotenoids in foods, beta-carotene, lycopene, and lutein 
are well- known leaders in the fight to reduce the damage from free radicals 
and are helpful with eye health.</p>
<p><b>Boxwood</b>: has been shown in research to foster immune stimulation and 
promotion of t-cell activation. This can be found in capsule and tincture.</p>
<p>CoQ10: (Coenzyme Q10) is a vitamin-like compound also called 
&quot;ubiquinone&quot;. It is an essential component of cells and is utilized 
by the mitochondria in the normal process of energy production. It helps 
convert food into energy at a cellular level. Coenzyme Q10 acts as an 
antioxidant, much like vitamins C and E, helping to neutralize the 
cell-damaging molecules known as free radicals. CoQ10 is one in a series of 
ubiquinones, naturally occurring compounds produced in nearly every cell of the 
body, and was discovered as recently as 1957.</p>
<p><b>The primary function of CoQ10</b> is as a catalyst for metabolism. 
Acting in conjunction with enzymes, the compound speeds up the vital metabolic 
process, providing the energy that the cells need to digest food, heal wounds, 
maintain healthy muscles, and perform other bodily functions as a major 
antioxidant in cardiac tissue and has protective effects on brain tissue. 
Studies indicate high dosage can be used safely and effectively. Certain 
cholesterol lowering drugs have also been shown to deplete coenzyme Q-10. 
Patients on cholesterol lowering drugs should consider adding at least 200mg of 
CoQ-10 daily.</p>
<p>Echinacea: (see drug-herb interactions) has been documented to stimulate 
the chemicals that promote t-cell activation and antibody production. It is 
very effective in lessening the course of the common cold and respiratory 
infections when used short term. There are some conflicting studies on its use 
long term as well as a caution that it may briefly increase viral load. Avoid 
long term (7- 10 days only) use as well as use prior to viral load blood 
counts. During the acute onset of a cold, 2 to 4 cups of strong echinacea tea 
or 3 capsules 3 times daily can help limit the course of the illness.</p>
<p>Fiber: helps in regulating lipid levels, removes toxins and provides bulk 
for healthy bowel habits. The colon requires bulk for it to achieve healthy 
movement. Optimal intake of fiber is about 25-30 grams per day. The ideal 
combination of soluble fiber (psyllium husk) and insoluble fiber (flax oil, 
fiber) helps to absorb water and toxins and adds roughage to bulk up stool and 
sweep away built up debris in the intestinal tract.</p>
<p>Foods high in fiber are fruits such as apples peaches, raspberries and 
tangerines. Vegetables such as acorn squash, raw broccoli, brussels sprouts, 
cabbage, carrots, cauliflower, spinach, black-eyed peas, cooked zucchini, 
kidney beans and lima beans. Also cooked whole- grain cereal, cold (All-Bran, 
Total, Bran Flakes), whole-grain cereal, hot (oatmeal, Wheatena) and 
whole-wheat or 7-grain bread.</p>
<p>Powdered psyllium is a quality source of supplemental fiber. Be sure to 
drink plenty of water, otherwise the fiber will form an obstructing mass, 
adding to your condition. Start with one rounded tablespoon of the powder 
stirred well into a glass of water or diluted juice.</p>
<p>Fish Oil: is known for being rich in unsaturated fatty acids and provides 
rich OMEGA-3 fatty acids, (Pure EPA 360mg/DHA 240mg). Fish Oils are made from 
natural marine lipid concentrate and may help reduce or inhibit risk factors 
involved in cardiovascular disease, as well as inflammatory and immune 
disorders. Long term use of fish oil shelp prevent aging skin, menopausal 
symptoms, promote better circulation, lower cholesterol, prevent blood clots, 
reduce heart related risk, and the pain of arthritis. Omega-3 and 
polyunsaturated fatty acids found in fish and deep sea fish oil help to protect 
against heart and blood vessel disease. Natural, essential fatty acids are 
essential to normal human cell and tissue growth and maintenance. If not found 
regularly in the diet, the diet must be supplemented. These fatty acids are 
especially abundant in brain cells, nerve relay stations (synapses), visual 
receptors (retinas), adrenal glands, and sex glands. The most biologically 
active tissues in the body. Take. 1000mg of fish oil in the morning and 1,000 
mg in the evening.</p>
<p><b>Flaxseed oil</b>: is derived from the seeds of the flax plant. Flaxseed 
oil and flaxseed contain substances that promote good health and is used as a 
nutritional supplement. It is rich in omega-3 fatty acids, especially 
alpha-linolenic acid, which appears to be beneficial for heart disease, 
inflammatory bowel disease, arthritis, cholesterol and a variety of other 
health conditions. Flaxseed also contains a group of chemicals called lignans 
that may play a role in the prevention of cancer. Take 1,000 mg of flaxseed oil 
in the morning and 1,000 mg in the evening.</p>
<p>Ginger: is helpful in tea or herb form for controlling nausea and vomiting. 
An anti-inflammatory, ginger has been used in Ayurvedic and Chinese medicine as 
an anti-inflammatory. Taking 6&iuml;&iquest;&frac12;50 grams of fresh or 
powdered ginger per day indicated that ginger might be helpful. Suggested 
Dosage: 0.5 to 1 mg of powdered ginger daily</p>
<p><b>Glutamine</b>: is one of the most abundant amino acids in our bodies, 
found in the gastrointestinal tract. This amino acid is compromised when the 
immune function is low. Studies have shown that Glutamine is one of the best 
amino acid supplements in maintaining a healthy gastrointestinal lining and 
helps to repair gastrointestinal damage. It can also be helpful in managing 
diarrhea. 1 to 2 grams of powdered glutamine may be mixed in smoothies or water.
</p>
<p>Licorice: (Glycerrhiza) (see drug-herb interactions) also has been used as 
a complementary immune modulator, although it should be avoided in people with 
hypertension. In my experience the immune modulators work much better when 
combined together rather than used as singular treatments. Licorice can be 
consumed as a tea daily and the mushrooms may be included in food preparation 
or taken in liquid tincture form for a more consistent higher dose.</p>
<p>Pau D'arco and Una de Gato: (Cat's Claw) are also clinically used to 
stimulate immune function and may be consumed in tea form daily or liquid 
tincture either during acute illness or as a preventative measure.</p>
<p>Probiotics: (Acidophilus, Bifidus, lactobacillus spirogenes) help to 
maintain balance of good and dangerous bacteria and compete for the food the 
dangerous bacteria need to grow and cause us problems. Lactobacillus 
acidophilus and bifidus may be found in yogurt with active culture or in 
supplements and can be consumed freely without known side effects. It should be 
refrigerated to maximize shelf life. Patients on antibiotic therapy, diagnosed 
with thrush, diarrhea or constipation should consider taking probiotics 2 
capsules 3 times daily with meals. For thrush a capsule can also be opened in 
some water and used daily as a mouth rinse.</p>
<p>Vitamins A, C and the B vitamins increase the immune function. Minerals 
such as Selenium help to stimulate immune function and fight infection, while 
Zinc enhances the immune system and assists in wound healing.</p>
<p><b>Herb-Drug Interactions</b> </p>
<p><b>Herb-drug interactions are very common</b>. Some herbal medicines may 
cancel the effect of a prescription drug, others may reduce it, or even 
exaggerate it. If you are on HIV medication or medications for associated 
symptoms or disorders, consider the information below:</p>
<p><b>Dong Quai</b>: taken for menopausal symptom control. Do not mix Dong 
Quai with warfarin (anticoagulants), St John's Wort and some antibiotics such 
as sulfonamides, quinolones.</p>
<p><b>Echinacea</b>: mostly taken as an immune boost to prevent cold and flu. 
Do not mix Echinacea with some heart medications, antifungal medications, HIV 
medications and anti-anxiety medications.</p>
<p><b>Ephedra</b>: A powerful decongestant. Contains ephedrine, which can open 
up bronchial passages. It's controversial because it's a powerful stimulant 
that can raise blood pressure, cause insomnia and high blood pressure. Do not 
mix with heart medications or if you are being treated for high blood pressure, 
glaucoma or thyroid problems.</p>
<p><b>Feverfew</b>: taken to reduce the severity of migraines. Do not take 
with other migraine medications, as, it may raise heart rate and blood 
pressure. Feverfew has the potential to react with warfarin anti- coagulants, 
increasing the thinning of blood.</p>
<p><b>Ginkgo</b>: increases blood flow and circulation throughout the body, 
can also help improve memory. May interact with anti-coagulant medications such 
as Aspirin, Coumadin, heparin and warfarin, causing the blood to thin too much, 
and provoking a serious bleeding disorder. A recent report in the New England 
Journal of Medicine describes a case of a man who'd been taking Aspirin to 
prevent a heart attack and had spontaneous bleeding into the eye from the iris 
within a week of taking a daily dose of ginkgo. Should not be taken with HIV 
medications.</p>
<p><b>Garlic</b>: is thought to help lower cholesterol and prevent the 
formation of blood clots that could lead to heart attacks. Garlic capsules may 
increase blood thinning if you are already on anti- coagulants. Do not take 
with diabetes medication because it may cause a decrease in blood sugars. Use 
caution with HIV medications.</p>
<p><b>Ginseng</b>: used to help reduce stress, boost energy and improve 
stamina, and may also help lower cholesterol. Can cause nervousness and 
excitation, and overuse can lead to headaches, insomnia and heart palpitations. 
Can increase blood pressure. Should not be used if you are taking prescriptions 
for high blood pressure or Coumadin.</p>
<p><b>Hawthorn</b>: claimed to be effective in helping reduce angina attacks 
by lowering blood pressure and cholesterol levels. Should not be taken digoxin, 
a heart medication. The mix may lower heart rate too much.</p>
<p><b>Kava</b>: is used to treat anxiety. It's also used to relieve insomnia 
and nervousness. Do not take Kava if you have a history of liver problems. Also 
do not mix with antidepressants, sedatives, and do not mix Kava with alcohol.
</p>
<p><b>Licorice</b>: used to treat coughs, colds and peptic ulcers. High doses 
can lead to increased blood pressure, water retention and potassium loss. Do 
not use with diuretics or digoxin because it could lead to further loss of 
potassium, essential for heart function.</p>
<p><b>St. John's wort</b>: a natural anti-depressant for mild to moderate 
depression. Do not take with other anti-depressants, HIV medications, oral 
contraceptives, some heart/blood thinning medications and Tamoxifen (a cancer 
drug).</p>
<p><b>Valerian</b>: a mild sedative with hypnotic effects, used to promote 
sleep, Should not be taken with alcohol or Valium.</p>
<p><b>Safe Sex Tips</b> </p>
<p><b>1. Use latex condom</b> for vaginal and anal intercourse. Use 
water-based lubricant (K-Y, Astroglide, and Probe); oil-containing products 
(Crisco, Vaseline, baby oil, lotion, and whipped cream) can destroy latex. A 
drop of lube inside the condom may increase sensitivity. Don't use saliva as a 
lubricant.</p>
<p><b>2. Other contraceptive devices</b> do not protect against AIDS. Product 
containing nonoxyno1-9 (a spermicide) can kill HIV and may provide extra 
protection, but should not be relied on alone. Some studies show that 
nonoxyno1-9 can cause genital irritation that may promote HIV infection, 
especially with very frequent intercourse. The effects of ingesting nonoxyno1-9 
are unstudied.</p>
<p><b>3. Blood-to-blood contact</b> is the most direct route of HIV 
transmission. Sharing needles (for drug steroids piercing or tattooing) razors 
or any implement that draws blood is dangerous since blood may be left on used 
implements. Clean needles by rinsing several times with bleach then with water. 
Avoid contact with blood in s/m scenes. Whips or knives that break the skin 
should not be used on another person until disinfected with bleach or a 
cleaning solution.</p>
<p><b>4. Use an unlubricated condom</b> for oral sex if a man will come in 
your mouth. For oral sex on a woman or oral-anal sex (rimming) use a dental dam 
(latex square) a condom or latex glove cut to produce a flat sheet or 
non-microwaveable food wrap. Rinse powder off dams before use. Use all barrier 
only once and only on one person.</p>
<p><b>5. Oral sex on a man</b> without ejaculation or on a non-menstruating 
woman is thought to be low risk activity. There is a risk that HIV could enter 
through small cuts of opening in the mouth gums of throat. Avoid brushing your 
teeth two hours before or after oral sex to minimize abrasions.</p>
<p><b>6. If you share sex toys</b> like dildos or vibrators put on a fresh 
condom for each user (and when going from anus to vagina) or guard bleach 
alcohol or soap and water.</p>
<p><b>7. Use latex gloves</b> for &quot;finger penetration&quot; or fisting to 
guard the wearer against infection through cuts on the hand or arm and to guard 
the partner against injury from fingernails.</p>
<p><b>8. Touching and kissing are safe</b>. It is safe to get semen vaginal 
fluid or urine on unbroken skin. No AIDS cases have been traced to kissing, 
including deep (French) kissing.</p>
<p><b>9. Precautions against HIV infection</b> can protect you from other 
sexually transmitted diseases such as gonorrhea, syphilis, chlamydia, herpes, 
yeast infections, amoebiasis, and hepatitis B.</p>

<h3><b>Alignment in the New Consciousness </b></h3> 
<p>by Shirley Knapp, Author of Sustaining Joy 
http://www.northwindsprod.com/sustainingjoy.htm<br>
www.shirleyknapp.com </p>
<p>At times it seems as though our lives are a bit challenging, perhaps 
frustrating, and, even in our darkest times, fearful. You may ask yourself, how 
do I live a more balanced life? When we have set our goals for truth, and 
living the life of unconditional love, we must remember that, it will always 
take us to the next steps of our spiritual journey.</p>
<p>This must be done without fear of change or resistance to growth. Others 
who watch you gradually shift and change need to understand that you embrace 
unconditional love as your choice in your life, and whatever lessons this 
brings to you; you need for your growth.</p>
<p>It is important for you to understand that, in your life, <b>you have what 
you truly need</b> to take the next steps into alignment. You are being guided 
by your intuition to go exactly where you need to go.</p>
<p> <b>There is no need to fear the unknown</b> and when you release the fear 
and develop trust you will take your next step in spiritual growth. Your inner 
soul searching is powerful and takes you where you need to be in your life. It 
doesn't support you to skip over your lessons,or go around them. It's the next 
rung on the ladder on your spiritual path. Support each other through these 
times; hold each other's hands and embrace each other's hearts emotionally 
because this isn't an easy exercise for any of us. The joy comes in knowing 
that you are clearly provided for, taken care of and never alone. This is how 
you will make the next shift in your consciousness and in making some shifts 
you'll feel more joyful and light than in others.</p>
<p>This <b>particular shift into alignment</b> has a different quality of a 
deeper, inward, soul search --deeper than you've gone ever before. But that's 
the beauty in the depth of which you are searching. It takes you into a new 
place, in your life. You are not ever without support and you must hold tightly 
to your truth. In essence, you must understand that very few people on this 
earth live in this particular way and walk in two worlds. What you are doing 
here is walking with a foot in two different worlds, gathering the strength 
from both dimensions. It's a very supportive place, and you will feel the 
self-empowerment in walking in both worlds. As you learn how to do this, you'll 
teach others how to do this because, as the consciousness shifts, others will 
ask you,<b>&quot;How do you live in this in this fearful world without falling 
apart?</b> Your world is shifting very quickly, and what is not aligned with 
you, cannot remain.</p>
<p>The alignment of consciousness is the most important thing for us to focus 
on at this time. It is not what you do; it is how you feel when you do it. It's 
not whom you connect with; it's how do you feel when you connect with them. The 
alignment in the very core of your soul needs to be shifted and tuned until you 
can feel the balance of alignment.</p>
<p>This next piece is to feel aligned on all levels that you share, whether it 
is how you work, how you relate to others, or how you live. This is how you 
help yourself and others shift into this new time.</p>
<p>You will notice the earth also shifting and changing. What is not aligned 
is being released. Let go. Those of you that walk the earth that are not 
aligned with the consciousness at this time are also being released with these 
changes. But the beauty is, When you do release and let go and open, the 
newness will be brought to you in a new level of comfort. Hold tight to both 
worlds. There are no gaps between the two. They overlap.<b>Choose joy and 
alignment in your life. Joy is your choice!</b> <br>

<h3><b>The Allergy Elimination Diet</b></h3> 
<p>by Andrew Pacholyk, MS, L.Ac. </p>
<p><b>By removing specific foods from our diet</b>, we have a better sense of 
what the culprit is and what it is that is triggering the reaction.</p>
<p><b>Excessive protein may irritate the immune system</b> and keep it in a 
state of overreactivity. The protein in cow's milk, specifically, is a frequent 
offender, and for people with a genetic predisposition to allergy it may be a 
hidden cause. One general treatment strategy, therefore, is to follow a 
low-protein diet and<b>try to eliminate milk and milk products</b>. </p>
<p>Food allergies can play a major role during childhood. They are related 
before age 6. You can manipulate an infant's diet and do well in helping their 
skin.<b>Eggs, orange juice, peanuts, corn and milk</b> have been implicated as 
aggravators in children. Parents should consult with their physicians about 
trying elimination diets. In general, these are foods that should not be 
eliminated.<b>It is only after testing them</b> by, first eliminating them and 
then re-introducing them back into the diet. Such diets seem to work best in 
infants less than 2 years old. After age 6, it is believed by experts that food 
plays a minimal role in most people.</p>
<p>For adults, diet manipulation should be undergone by each individual. If 
you think there's any food you eat that has an adverse effect on your body, 
avoid it and see what happens, If your problem clears up,you may have a food 
allergy.</p>
<p><b>First</b>, eliminate the food you feel is causing trouble for a two week 
period.</p>
<p><b>Second</b>, re-introduce the food (one at a time only) back into your 
diet for a week. If symptoms start to recur (itchy throat, phlegm, digestive 
upset, nasal congestion...) you are most likely allergic or have some type of 
sensitivity to that particular food.</p>
<p><b>Natural, accurate ways to test</b> for food allergies and food 
sensitivities that are non-invasive.</p>
<p>1. Take your resting pulse rate for a full 60 seconds. </p>
<p>2. Hold a bit of food that you are testing in your mouth. Do not chew or 
swallow it, just hold it there.</p>
<p>3. While you have the food in your mouth, take your pulse rate again. If it 
remains the same, you are most likely not allergic or sensitive to it. If it 
goes up 3 beats or more, you most likely are either sensitive and/or 
allergic.and you should follow up with your healthcare provider.</p>
<p>Managing Your Allergies </p>
<p><b>Antihistamines interfere with brain activity</b>, causing drowsiness and 
depression. Never use antihistamines if you have a<b>tendency toward depression 
or mental dullness</b>. Even when these drugs do not depress mental activity, 
they merely suppress allergy rather than cure it. As a result the pattern of 
immune overresponsiveness is strengthened rather than weakened, meaning that 
more treatment will be required in the future.</p>
<p>This is <b>even more so with steroid drugs</b> (cortisone and related 
compounds). Never use cortisone, prednisone, or other steroid drugs to treat 
allergic reactions unless they are very severe or life-threatening. If you must 
take these powerful hormones, limit your use of them to two weeks. Steroids 
perpetuate allergy through their suppressive action.<b>They also lower immunity
</b>. </p>
<p><b>Air-conditioning your house is probably the single most important thing 
you can do to alleviate pollen problems</b>, and it can help with two other 
chief inhalants:<b>mold and dust mites</b>. </p>
<p>Vitamin C has antihistamine activity. Vitamin C supplementation has been 
reported to help people with hay fever in preliminary research. Consider 3,000 
- 6,000 mg of Vitamin C in divided doses, per day.</p>
<p><b>Bioflavonoids such as Quercetin</b>, might act synergistically with 
Vitamin C as both have antihistaminic activity. Although some doctors of 
natural medicine advise people with hay fever to take 400 mg of Quercetin two 
to three times per day, only limited preliminary clinical research has yet 
suggested that Quercetin benefits people with this condition.<br>
</p>
<p>Emotional Aspects: </p>
<p>There is an <b>emotional aspect to every illness</b>. Often times, it is 
the emotional thoughts or &quot;excess emotions&quot; that will lead to illness.
</p>
<p>According to <b>metaphysical expert Louise Hay</b>, allergies relate to the 
fact that we deny our own power! Who are you allergic to? Emotional congestion, 
fear of the calendar or a belief in self-persecution or guilt are other issues 
that tend to come up very often with those who have allergies.</p>
<p>Again this emotional aspect is, indeed, part of the ellimination diet that 
must be addressed as well, in order to heal.</p>
<p><b>Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM)</b> also looks at allergies in an 
energetic way.<b>Acupuncturist Heidi M. Hawkins</b>, L.Ac explains allergies in 
TCM, which is an energetic medical system, meaning it affects a person's health 
via their energy systems. &quot;Energy (Qi) courses through the body in 
pathways called meridians. TCM seeks to address any imbalance in health by 
affecting this energy. All symptoms, including allergies, are indicative of an 
energy imbalance.</p>
<p>An allergy, by energetic definition, <b>is the body's signal that something 
isn't right</b>. Allergies call attention through a reaction to anything that a 
person is not in &quot;right relationship&quot; with. This could be virtually 
anything: things found in nature, man-made chemicals, even another person! All 
&quot;sensitivities&quot; and &quot;intolerances&quot; are included in this, a 
very broad definition of allergy.<b>Energetic definition of allergy</b> does 
not require immune response to an allergen, only a reaction of some kind: 
something which disrupts the balance of a person's qi in any way.</p>
<p><b>Allergies make sense</b>. The body responds with an allergic reaction as 
a way of communicating to you that you have had too much of something. The body 
tells you to stay away from something for a good reason, such as toxic 
overload. Something as simple as a food can become toxic if too much of it is 
eaten, especially if it is not properly metabolized. Many people have 
compromised digestive metabolism because of poor diet, medications such as 
antibiotics, and the presence of parasitic organisms or<b>Lingering Pathogenic 
Factors</b>. To address the allergy properly, it is important to treat these 
underlying reasons, and not just the allergy itself.&quot;</p>
<p>These are all musts, that I always suggest a patient do in case of 
allergies.<b>The Allergy Elimination Diet</b> is the best way to balance all 
aspects of your mind, body and emotional spirit.<br>

<h3><b>Natural Antihistamine Herbs</b></h3> 
<p>by Andrew Pacholyk, MS, L.Ac. </p>
<p><b>Histamine is a chemical</b>, which is involved in our local immune 
response as well as regulating physiological function in the gut, acting as a 
neurotransmitter. During the time of seasonal allergies, the body's immune 
system sees pollen as an invader. In an allergic reaction, our body produces 
histamine, as a defense mechanism. This inflammatory chemical attaches the 
cells in our body and causes irritation. It is the deficiency of this enzyme 
that triggers an allergic reaction as histamines gathers in the synapses.</p>
<p><b>An antihistamine</b> serves to reduce or eliminate the effects brought 
on by histamine, a chemical mediator released during allergic reactions. 
Antihistamines are commonly used for allergic rhinitis, allergic 
conjunctivitis, contact dermatitis, urticaria (hives), angioedema and pruritus 
(atopic dermatitis, insect bites).</p>
<p><b>There are hundreds of plants used all over the world</b>, which are used 
in herbal medicine as treatments for<b>hystamine attacks</b>. Here are some of 
the most accessible and reliable.</p>
<p>Basil (Ocimum sanctum): this great herb has a history in helping prevent 
stomach cramps, gas as well as constipation. A poultice of Basil leaves can can 
work as an antihistamine to draw out insect, bee wasp, or snake venom. It helps 
alleviate acne, heal abrasions and speeds healing when used on cuts.</p>
<p>Chamomile (Matricaria chamomilla): is rich in anti-histamine properties. 
The flowers can be crushed and used as a poultice for inflammatory swelling. 
Make a tea and drink 2-3 times a day. Chamomile can cause histaminic allergic 
reactions in some very sensitive people. If this occurs, simply discontinue.</p>
<p>Jewelweed (Impatiens aurea): contains a compound called &quot;Lawsone&quot; 
that treats uticaria. Jewelweed is used as a natural remedy for poison ivy, 
poison oak, okra spines, stinging nettle and acne treatment. Jewelweed is also 
used for heat rash, ringworm and many other skin disorders, as well as bug 
bites and razor burn.</p>
<p>Papaya (Petroselinum crispum): inhibits the secretion of histamine. Papaya 
juice can be taken internally as well as applied topically to diffuse a 
histamine attack.</p>
<p>Stinging Nettle (Urtica dioica): The very same plant that will produce 
hives if its hairs inject their histamine into you can work to heal the 
problem. Some herbs whose pollen can cause symptoms of hay fever have been used 
as a way to reduce symptoms of hay fever, which is the homeopathic theory of 
&quot;like cures like&quot;. The most important of these are Goldenrod and 
Ragweed (Ambrosia ambrosioides). Eyebright and Elder also have a reputation for 
use as hay fever remedies. However, an individual allergic to one of these 
plants should avoid them unless under the care of a doctor of natural medicine. 
Freeze-dried nettle leaf extract taken in capsule form will treat hives and 
allergies. The plant does not contain enough histamine to cause a problem when 
taken orally. Tea can be made from the leaves or cooked as greens. The stinging 
hairs lose their sting when the plant is cooked.</p>
<p>Echinacea (Echinacea purpurea): Echinacea is a widely used herbal remedy 
for treatment of upper respiratory tract infections. This purple coneflower has 
shown to have antihistamine properties.</p>
<p>Fennel (Foeniculum vulgare): In my Chinese herbal practice, fennel is used 
for indigestion, spasms in the digestive tract, as well as expelling phlegm 
from the lungs. Fennel is rich with the antioxidant flavonoid 
&quot;Quercetin&quot;. Quercetin is a strong natural antihistamine shown to be 
very helpful for allergies and histamine-related inflammation. Make as a tea 
and drink 2-3 times per day.</p>
<p>Ginger (Zingiber officinale): another classic herb in the Chinese Materia 
Medica, ginger works well on allergic reactions such as hives and wheals. Slice 
up a ginger root boil it in eight cups of water for 30 minutes. Allow the herbs 
to steep for another 30 after you have boiled it. Drink 2 to 3 cups a day. You 
may add the tea to a hot bath and soak for 20 minutes. Dip a wash cloth in the 
tea once it is at room temperature and use as a compress.</p>
<p>Reishi (Ganoderma lucidum): Hailed the &quot;mushroom of immortality&quot;, 
one of my favorite natural remedies is Reishi (Ling Zhi). Japanese researchers 
have found that reishi acts as an antihistamine, making it useful for treating 
allergies. &quot;Lanostan&quot;, a compound found in reishi, appears to control 
the release of transmitting chemicals in the body, thereby inhibiting the 
release of histamine. Since reishi also promotes the adrenal function and 
immune reaction, it has added effectiveness in controlling the body's reaction 
to an allergen.</p>
<p>Thyme (Thymus vulgaris): is a natural antihistamine, as well as having 
antiseptic properties to help purge infections. The essential oil has been 
shown to have antimicrobial activity against a host of different bacteria and 
fungi.</p>
<p><b>Vitamin C</b> is believed to be a natural antihistamine agent if used at 
high doses, around 3,000mg to 5,000mg a day.</p>
<p>Wild Oregano (Origanum vulgare): aka Wild Marjoram, have at least seven 
different antihistaminic chemicals, therefore fights allergies as well as 
fungus and infection.</p>
<p><b>Essential Oils As Antihistamines</b> </p>
<p>Essential oils should be used in a base oil (to avoid irritation) and 
massaged on the skin.<b>Never use essential oils internally</b>. </p>
<p><b>Caraway Seed Oil</b>: has antihistamine and antimicrobial properties and 
is very effective in treating mild allergic reactions.</p>
<p> Clove Oil: has antihistamine properties. This essential oil is helpful in 
the treatment of dermatitis due to allergic reactions.</p>
<p> Lemon balm (also known as melissa): has antihistamine action and is useful 
to treat eczema and headaches. This essential oil has antihistamine properties 
and helps with allergies.<br>

<h3><b>Archetypes in Relationships</b></h3> 
<p> by Therese Emmanuel Grey </p>
<p><b>Archetypes</b> are visual symbols or energetic imprints that exist in 
our psyches. Some are readily understood while others bring subliminal messages 
that are there to help you trigger your memory of why you are here and the 
truth behind the illusion of reality. Archetypes can often convey messages that 
verbal and written information cannot.</p>
<p><b>Archetypes are found everywhere</b> - as their symbols are a language of 
the mind - taken to different frequencies of thought and connected to each 
other by the collective unconsciousness. There are individual and universal 
archetypes. You become aware of them in meditation - dreamtime - remote viewing 
or other out-of-body experiences - when you doodle on a pad - crop circles or 
landscape art, other art forms, jewelry, hieroglyphs, a logo, on a billboard - 
anywhere at all. Archetypes can also be auditory - a tone - a series of notes - 
a harmonic... Reality is a series of metaphors set into motion by the 
synchronicity of archetypes we experience.</p>
<p><b>The term Archetype began with Carl Jung</b>. In Jung's terms - 
'Archetype' is defined as the first original model of which all other similar 
persons, objects, or concepts are merely derivative, copied, patterned, or 
emulated. Carl Jung is one of the most respected and recognized psychologists 
of all time. Many people know Jung as one of Sigmund Freud's followers and 
co-workers. Jung's emphasis in the field in psychology had to do with dreams. 
Jung developed many theories about dreams, a lot of them disagreeing with 
Freud. Jung was a great psychologist and psychiatrist that changed the ways of 
psychology today.</p>
<p><b>Jung thought that dreams were a tool</b> to help us grow, not just to 
release extreme sexual desires. Jung felt that dreams were more than about sex, 
they were about life. Jung said that sexual drive doesn't even motivate us as 
much as the fear of death. Jung was an inspiration to all in the psychology 
field. His theories are instrumental in psychology and psychiatry fields today. 
He was a brilliant man not afraid to stand on his own for what he believed in.
</p>
<p><b>It was Jung, a contemporary of Edgar Cayce's</b>, who found convincing 
evidence for a deep level to the unconscious mind. This profound depth, Jung 
felt, came from a genuine spiritual reality that hadn't been acknowledged by 
Freud. Jung called this level the &quot;collective unconscious.&quot; Here all 
minds could communicate through the use of universal symbols - images which 
seem to have a common meaning among people all over the world.</p>
<p><b>For example, a symbol</b> such as a lion or a great cat has a universal 
or archetypal meaning of power and vitality. Birds frequently symbolize various 
kinds of love or concern; water is often suggestive of the Spirit itself. An 
old woman or an old man or a grandfatherly figure can symbolize our own 
&quot;Higher Self' or our own internal wisdom. Myths or fairy tales often have 
similarities among cultures, and these similarities are shown through their 
universal symbols and themes. Sometimes our own dreams may contain these kinds 
of symbols.</p>
<p><b>Of course, not all the symbols</b> and images in our dreams represent 
the universal or archetypal. Many, if not most, are best interpreted by 
discovering the personal associations one has with that person or object. The 
dream symbol of a rifle, for example, would likely mean one thing to a gunsmith 
and something quite different to a victim of war.</p>
<p><b>These Archetype patterns</b> derive from a universal collective 
unconscious, which in metaphysics is called the Grids - Akashic Records - Sea 
of Consciousness - that which creates our reality In this context, archetypes 
are innate prototypes for ideas, which may subsequently become involved in the 
interpretation of observed phenomena.</p>
<p><b>The four universal archetypes or energies are known as our inner family 
archetypes</b>, because they are best described through the concepts of Father, 
Mother, Boychild and Girlchild. Each archetype has a light side and a dark 
side. When we express their loving qualities, we become our best self for 
ourselves and for others. When we yield to their unloving side, we become our 
worst self and end up ruining our relationships.</p>
<p> <b>Generally, people who function from a strong Father archetype</b> 
pursue the law. They tend to have strong boundaries and seek to download a 
blueprint for every situation. When their Father energy goes out of balance and 
becomes unloving, they can become harsh and critical toward themselves and 
others.</p>
<p><b> People who express a strong Mother archetype</b> live to nurture life. 
They love to guide and teach others, and provide stability in any given 
situation. When they are threatened, they respond by either going aloof or by 
smothering those around them with a spoiling mechanism. Either way, they avoid 
further giving of themselves.</p>
<p><b>People who have a strong Boychild archetype</b> are go-getters in life. 
They are highly competitive and do whatever it takes to reach their goal. When 
their archetype goes negative, they become overcompetitive, aggressive, and 
tend to run over others.</p>
<p><b>People who have a strong Girlchild archetype</b> go with the flow. They 
experience life through serendipity. They are highly creative, caring and 
intuitive. When their sensitivity is trampled, however, the unloving side of 
Girlchild takes over. They become victim-martyrs, prosecutors who ultimately 
feel superior to their persecutors.</p>
<p><b>Working with the archetypes</b> to improve your relationships involves 
several steps. First you start to recognize how you and other people express 
these archetypes. Some people are more comfortable with one archetype than 
another, and seek that energy in their relationships. People who want Mother, 
for example, are always looking to be nurtured by others. People who have an 
aversion to Boychild for example, find that energy too aggressive for them.</p>
<p><b>The next step is to understand</b> which archetype you, and the person 
you&rsquo;re dealing with, patterned at the conscious, subconscious, 
superconscious and unconscious level. Your conscious archetype is the one you 
think through and how you relate to others in a general way. If you have a 
conscious Boychild frame of reference, you will be very enterprising. If 
it&rsquo;s conscious Mother, you would rather have all of your bases covered 
before making a move. If your conscious archetype is Girlchild, you see the 
world through intuitive, spherical and highly creative eyes.</p>
<p><b>Your subconscious archetype</b> rules how you feel. If someone offends 
you, watch how you react. If you feel through subconscious Girlchild, you will 
be highly sensitive. This is different from people who inherit the tough 
underbelly of subconscious Boychild, subconscious Father or even the underlying 
adult quality of subconscious Mother.</p>
<p><b>Your superconscious archetype relates</b> to the qualities you aspire to 
in life, and the &ldquo;ideal&rdquo; you seek in another person. Do you aspire 
to Mother, to people who nurture and teach? Are you drawn to people who exude 
the energy of Father and pursue order, blueprints and the letter of the law. Do 
you long for someone who impersonates the mystical kindness of Girlchild or do 
you hunger for the zestful enthusiasm of a Boychild warrior?</p>
<p><b>Knowing your unconscious archetype</b> is also key in determining the 
quality of your relationships. This archetype represents your rejected self, 
and you project it onto others. If Boychild is in your unconscious, you will 
regrettably draw &ldquo;bullies&rdquo; to yourself, people who push your 
buttons. If you have Mother in the unconscious, you will tend to magnetize 
abandonment. If Father is your unconscious archetype, you may encounter more 
than a fair share of trouble with the law, and be prone to criticism. If 
Girlchild is your rejected archetype, you may draw to yourself wounded people 
who seek to prosecute you for an alleged offense.</p>
<p><b> Once you know your archetypes</b>, you can move towards overcoming the 
limitations of your specific pattern. This is liberating and empowering. It 
will allow you to relate to your loved ones in a more authentic way so you can 
strengthen your relationships. You will understand what trips you up and where 
other people are coming from. You will have empathy and bring out the best in 
yourself and in others. You will truly know who you are and express your 
highest self.<br>

<h3><b> Jungian Archetypes </b></h3> 
<p> by wikipedia </p>
<p><b>The anima and animus</b>, in Carl Jung's school of analytical 
psychology, are the two primary anthropomorphic archetypes of the unconscious 
mind, as opposed to both the theriomorphic and inferior-function of the shadow 
archetypes, as well as the abstract symbol sets that formulate the archetype of 
the Self. The anima and animus are described by Jung as elements of his theory 
of the collective unconscious, a domain of the unconscious that transcends the 
personal psyche. In the unconscious of the male, it finds expression as a 
feminine inner personality: anima; equivalently, in the unconscious of the 
female it is expressed as a masculine inner personality: animus.</p>
<p><b>The anima (animus)</b> can be identified as the totality of the 
unconscious feminine psychological qualities that a male possesses; or the 
masculine ones possessed by the female. It is an archetype of the collective 
unconscious and not an aggregate of father or mother, brothers, sisters, aunts, 
uncles or teachers, though these aspects of the personal unconscious can 
influence for good or ill the person.</p>
<p><b>Because a man's sensitivity must often be repressed</b>, the anima is 
one of the most significant autonomous complexes of all. It is said to manifest 
itself by appearing in dreams. It also influences a man's interactions with 
women and his attitudes toward them, and vice versa for females and the animus. 
Jung said that &quot;the encounter with the shadow is the 'apprentice-piece' in 
the individual's development...that with the anima is the 'masterpiece'&quot;. 
Jung viewed the anima process as being one of the sources of creative ability.
</p>
<p><b>In the book</b> The Invisible Partners it is said that the key to 
controlling one's anima (animus) is to recognize it when it manifests and 
exercise our ability to discern the anima (animus) from reality.</p>
<p><b>The Persona</b>, for Jung, was the social face the individual presented 
to the world - 'a kind of mask, designed on the one hand to make a definite 
impression upon others, and on the other to conceal the true nature of the 
individual'. For the growing child, the development of a viable social persona 
is a vital part of adapting to, and preparing for adult life in, the external 
social world. 'A strong ego relates to the outside world through a flexible 
persona; identification with a specific persona (doctor, scholar, artist, etc.) 
inhibits psychological development' Thus for Jung 'the danger is that [people] 
become identical with their personas - the professor with his textbook, the 
tenor with his voice' The result could be 'the shallow, brittle, conformist 
kind of personality which is &quot;all persona&quot;, with its excessive 
concern for &quot;what people think&quot; - an unreflecting state of mind 'in 
which people are utterly unconscious of any distinction between themselves and 
the world in which they live. They have little or no concept of themselves as 
beings distinct from what society expects of them'. The stage was set thereby 
for what Jung termed Enantiodromia - the emergence of the repressed 
individuality from beneath the persona later in life: 'the individual will 
either be completely smothered under an empty persona or an enantiodromia into 
the buried opposites will occur'</p>
<p><b>In Jungian psychology, the shadow or &quot;shadow aspect&quot;</b> is a 
part of the unconscious mind consisting of repressed weaknesses, shortcomings, 
and instincts. It is one of the three most recognizable archetypes, the others 
being the anima and animus and the persona. &quot;Everyone carries a 
shadow,&quot; Jung wrote, &quot;and the less it is embodied in the individual's 
conscious life, the blacker and denser it is.&quot; It may be (in part) one's 
link to more primitive animal instincts, which are superseded during early 
childhood by the conscious mind. According to Jung, the shadow, in being 
instinctive and irrational, is prone to projection: turning a personal 
inferiority into a perceived moral deficiency in someone else. Jung writes that 
if these projections are unrecognized &quot;The projection-making factor (the 
Shadow archetype) then has a free hand and can realize its object--if it has 
one--or bring about some other situation characteristic of its power.&quot; 
These projections insulate and cripple individuals by forming an ever thicker 
fog of illusion between the ego and the real world. From one perspective, 'the 
shadow...is roughly equivalent to the whole of the Freudian unconscious'; and 
Jung himself considered that 'the result of the Freudian method of elucidation 
is a minute elaboration of man's shadow-side unexampled in any previous age'. 
Jung also believed that &quot;in spite of its function as a reservoir for human 
darkness&acirc;&#128;&#148;or perhaps because of this&acirc;&#128;&#148;the 
shadow is the seat of creativity.&quot;; so that for some, it may be, 'the dark 
side of his being, his sinister shadow...represents the true spirit of life as 
against the arid scholar'.</p>
<p><b>The Trickster or Clown</b>, is an example of a Jungian archetype. In 
modern literature the trickster survives as a character archetype, not 
necessarily supernatural or divine, sometimes no more than a stock character. 
In mythology, and in the study of folklore and religion, a trickster is a god, 
goddess, spirit, man, woman, or anthropomorphic animal who plays tricks or 
otherwise disobeys normal rules and conventional behavior. It is suggested by 
Hansen (2001) that the term &quot;Trickster&quot; was probably first used in 
this context by Daniel G. Brinton in 1885. In later folklore, the 
trickster/clown is incarnated as a clever, mischievous man or creature, who 
tries to survive the dangers and challenges of the world using trickery and 
deceit as a defense. He also is known for entertaining people as a clown does. 
For example many typical fairy tales have the King who wants to find the best 
groom for his daughter by ordering several trials. No brave and valiant prince 
or knight manages to win them, until a poor and simple peasant comes. With the 
help of his wits and cleverness, instead of fighting, he evades or fools 
monsters and villains and dangers with unorthodox manners. Therefore the most 
unlikely candidate passes the trials and receives the reward. The trickster is 
an enduring archetype that crosses many cultures and appears in a wide variety 
of popular media.</p>
<p><b>The Divine Child</b> archetype, is an important Jungian archetype in 
Jungian psychology, first suggested by Swiss psychologist, Carl Jung. Recently, 
author Caroline Myss suggested Child, amongst four the Survival Archetypes 
(Victim, Prostitute, and Saboteur), present in all of us. It ranges from 
&quot;childish to childlike longing for the innocent, regardless of age&quot;, 
as mentioned in her work, Sacred Contracts, which talk of the presence many 
aspects of the Child archetype, ranging from the Wounded Child, Abandoned or 
Orphan Child, Dependent Child, Magical/Innocent Child, Nature Child, to the 
Divine Child and Eternal Child Jung placed 'the child (including the child 
hero)' in a list of archetypes incorporating 'the chief among them...like 
milestones of the individuation process'. Jungians exploring the hero myth have 
noted that 'over and over again one hears a tale describing the hero's 
miraculous but humble birth', and have considered that '&quot;it represents our 
efforts to deal with the problem of growing up, aided by the illusion of an 
eternal fiction&quot;'. Thus for Jung, '&quot;the child is potential 
future&quot;', with the archetype 'symbolizing the whole personality in its 
development from primordial unconsciousness to ego consciousness to self'. 
Others have warned however of the dangers posed to the parents by 'the 
&quot;archetype of the Divine Child&quot;...an emotional pull toward imagining 
an extraordinary potential contained in the infant'. Where this becomes too 
strong, 'the child is co-opted into an arrangement whereby he or she is to 
provide the parents with a certain magic...the Divine Child'.</p>
<p><b>The growing child 'caught up in the complex</b> [as] adult believes that 
she or he is especially wonderful, as wonderful as an idealized child...unable 
to see the problems with feeling like the king - superior, special, or unique'. 
Even where impacting less acutely, the archetype may produce 'a man who remains 
too long in adolescent psychology, generally associated with a strong 
unconscious attachment to the mother (actual or symbolic). Positive traits are 
spontaneity and openness to change'; negative, the emergence of a 
'superficially entrancing but basically immature child-man who is incapable of 
commitment ...an identification with the Divine Child, Mama's darling'. His 
'female counterpart is the puella, an &quot;eternal girl&quot; with a 
corresponding attachment to the father-world'.<br>

<h3><b>Autism</b></h3> 
<p>by Andrew Pacholyk, MS, L.Ac. </p>
<p>Autism may be a symptom of several different biological entities which 
merely present as a similar behavioral complex in early child development. As 
we currently refer to the social, behavioral and language abnormalities as 
autism, a more accurate diagnosis for most children with this disorder would be 
autoimmune or dysimmune encephalopathy. Before parents can make the right 
decisions regarding their child's care, a good diagnosis is critical.</p>
<p>Researchers at Johnson &amp; Johnson have found a very toxic compound in 
the urine of children with autism - dermorphin. Dermorphin is only found one 
other place in nature - the poison of the Amazonian Poison Dart Frog! It is 10 
million times more potent and toxic than morphine (Alan Friedman, PhD at 
J&amp;J). Other researchers have confirmed it is essentially always present in 
children with autism that receive even tiny amounts of casein or gluten.</p>
<p>Traditional Chinese Medicine, Acupuncture and Herbal Medicine </p>
<p>&quot;The causes of autism can be either postnatal (after birth) or 
congenital (during pregnancy). In Traditional Chinese Medical theory, the 
&quot;Kidney&quot; is the congenital organ, while &quot;Spleen&quot; is the 
essential postnatal organ function. Based on this theory, the postnatal 
autistic condition is mostly caused by the child's impaired digestion system, 
which is the problem of the Spleen (and/or the Stomach) that prevents the body 
from absorbing nutrients such as Vitamin B6 and other elements needed for brain 
development and maintenance. The impaired Spleen and Stomach also cause an 
impaired immune system&quot;.</p>
<p>Traditional Chinese Medicine theory says, &quot;Brain is the ocean of 
Marrow; Kidneys governs and produces the Marrow.&quot; It considers that the 
Kidneys dominate congenital situations. According to Chinese theory, the 
congenital Autism might be traced to parents' Kidney function problem, which 
could be the mother's, or sometimes even the father's. The Chinese doctors said 
that, when the mother has &quot;weak&quot; Kidney (this condition will not be 
detected or considered as a problem in terms of Western Medicine) during her 
pregnancy, her system is not absorbing Vitamin B6 properly. The lack of Vitamin 
B6 and other vital elements interrupted structural and functional development 
of the brain. As a result, this child would be born with brain function 
disorder.</p>
<p>Researchers who are studying autism are reaching a similar conclusion as 
the Chinese doctors, and are improving the autistic child's digestive system 
and immune system. By doing so they are significantly improving the symptoms of 
autism.</p>
<p>Researchers are finding that many children with autism with alternative 
diets (casein and gluten free) and nutritional supplementation dramatically 
improve. Many of the symptoms have been reduced by as much as 90%.</p>
<p><b>***Please Note:</b> In Traditional Chinese Medicine the term 
&quot;organs&quot; are not the organs Western anatomical science refers to. 
Instead they are &quot;functional&quot; organs. For example the &quot;spleen 
function&quot; is quite different than the anatomical spleen in Western 
Medicine. Traditional Chinese Medicine views the human body system as whole. 
All &quot;functional organs&quot; interact and influence each other.***</p>
<p>Western Medical Theory </p>
<p>The theory that gluten-free/casein-free diets can help young children with 
autism comes from studies suggesting that some cases of autistic behavior 
result from allergies or intolerances to the proteins in milk (casein) and 
found in wheat (gluten, also in other grains). Limited research does show that 
some children with autism can't break down the proteins completely. Instead, 
fragments of them (peptides) get into the bloodstream and the central nervous 
system before eventually being eliminated in the urine. Several groups of 
researchers have identified these peptides in urine samples from children with 
autism. Some of the peptides are quite similar to morphine and, in theory, may 
be the agents that cause autistic behavior.</p>

<h3><b>Autism, why more boys than girls? </b></h3> 
<p>by Mike Kohloff www.55fix.com </p>
<p><b>Fact:</b> Autistic boys far outnumber Autistic girls, by about 4 to 1. 
</p>
<p>This is often noted, but rarely explained as to &quot;WHY?&quot; </p>
<p>This is a tremendous clue as to the true cause of Autism &amp; therefore 
must be passed over &amp; generally ignored by Big Medicine &amp; the Big Media 
which is strongly influenced by Drug advertising money. The next time you watch 
the evening news, please count the number of PharmaKorp ads. Therefore you 
should not expect to receive the truth about any heavy advertiser on TV, or for 
that matter, in Medical Journals either.</p>
<p>Knowing the mechanics of the damage of Autism points a big finger at the 
cause. What is the difference between girls &amp; boys? (Don't get cute, I'm 
talking about the Bio-chemistry difference.)</p>
<p>Estrogen is itself a powerful antioxidant, neuro protector, &amp; immune 
system enhancement. Infant girls also have higher glutathione levels, a 
powerful antioxidant &amp; immune enhancer. Boys lack one &amp; have less of 
the other. That's the main Biochemical difference between boys &amp; girls. Who 
said females were the weaker sex?</p>
<p>Therefore, the cause of Autism is likely to be connected to oxidative 
stress (free radical damage by a powerful oxidant), something which damages 
brain tissue, something which challenges the immune system, uses up large 
amounts of glutathione, or perhaps an active virus or bacterial infection. 
Perhaps all the above.</p>
<p>Injection of a vaccine with Squalene, antifreeze, mercury, formaldehyde, 
aluminum, a live virus or two, &amp; other immune system stressors (adjuvants) 
would be very effective at producing all the above. So it's not just the 
mercury.</p>
<p>Now a push is underway to dismiss the gender factor by explaining it away 
as better or different reporting, &amp; that girls have close to the same 
Autism rates as boys but just &quot;display Autism less obviously than 
boys&quot; &amp; other misrepresentations (hogwash).</p>
<p>But it is critical that the cause of Autism must be believed to be some 
vague general pollution, parental neglect, or Genetics. That way nobody has to 
pay $3 million to care for every child with Autism for the rest of their lives. 
I estimate over 3 million Autistic kids in North America &amp; Europe alone 
(&amp; increasing yearly) for a total of about 10 Trillion Dollars. The 
Goldman-Sachs &amp; Bank bailout was only 700 Billion. We're beginning to talk 
about some serious money, people.</p>
<p><b>Pop Quiz:</b> What's another word for Ten Trillion Dollars? </p>
<p><b>Answer:</b> Motive. </p>
<p>People have been murdered for the spare cash in their wallets. What might a 
group of rich, powerful, &amp; politically connected Corporations &amp; their 
executives do to avoid losing Ten Trillion Dollars?</p>
<p>That does not include attorney fees, court fees, pain &amp; suffering, 
additional punitive damages, the &quot;perp walk,&quot; or prison time in a 
small cell with Ice Pick Johnson or the social director for the local chapter 
of the Aryan Nation. All of that is powerful motivation to lie, cover up, bribe 
politicians, fund slanted &amp; fraudulent medical studies to exonerate 
vaccines, &amp; delay &amp; stall so the guilty can enjoy their lives in 
freedom &amp; luxury till their personal clocks run out.</p>
<p>And they are not in it alone. The school districts that required 
vaccinations, the Doctors that gave them, the Military that ordered them (Gulf 
War Syndrome), the State &amp; Federal Governments that approved them are all 
guilty as well. And to stop the vaccinations could be seen as an admission that 
something is wrong with them. So the damage goes on.</p>
<p>The deep pockets on the expensive pants covering so many rich &amp; 
powerful butts must be protected at all costs. The lives of the children of the 
insignificant are of no consequence. The recent Banking &amp; Mortgage fraud is 
small change in comparison. That was just about stealing money. Autism is about 
stealing lives. The lives of our innocent &amp; helpless children.<br>
