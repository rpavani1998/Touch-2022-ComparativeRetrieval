<h1>An Interview with Philippe Sionneau</h1> 
<p>By Brian Carter, MSCi, LAc</p> 
<p>Philippe Sionneau is one of the best-known authors and teachers of Chinese 
medicine (CM) in the West. Among his many books are<em>The Treatment of Modern 
Western Medical Diseases with Chinese Medicine</em>(with Bob Flaws) and his 
seven-volume series,<em>The Treatment of Disease in Chinese Medicine </em>(with 
Lu Gang).</p> <br>
 I have the highest respect for his use of exclusively 
Chinese sources. Imagine my surprise when I discovered he had signed up for<em>
The Pulse of Oriental Medicine</em>'s e-zine! I was honored once again when he 
graciously agreed to this interview. It is with great pleasure that I present 
to you a few words from Philippe Sionneau.
<p></p> 
<p><strong>Brian Benjamin Carter (BBC):</strong> Many CM practitioners in the 
West have been trained from secondary sources (translations). What 
misconceptions do you find yourself clearing up again and again?</p> 
<p><strong>Philippe H. Sionneau (PHS):</strong> Here we're touching the heart 
of studying Chinese medicine in the West. You have to understand that for at 
least 2,500 years, Chinese medicine relied on written transmission. The 
essential notions of this medical art are conveyed through the language, and 
the Chinese language is highly specific and foreign. It is essentially 
different from our Indo-European languages. This is a huge obstacle for those 
of us who are teachers, writers and translators. I don't think learning from 
translations is a major drawback as long as the translations are consistent. 
There are always more translations, and their quality is improving. Ultimately, 
the problem lies elsewhere. Chinese medicine was built upon the major Chinese 
trends of thought, which see the world quite differently than we do. To 
understand the fundamental theories we think we already know (such as yin and 
yang, the Five Phases,<em>qi</em>, the Three Treasures and the Five Spirits), 
one needs an in-depth knowledge of both Chinese culture and the Chinese way of 
thinking. For instance, the way we understand yin and yang and the Five Phases 
is very much influenced by the strictly-defined, rigid concepts of Western 
logic. This rigidity dictates an intellectual approach which leads to a 
fragmented perspective. It has nothing to do with the original dynamic and 
universal Chinese vision, which was based upon perception and movement. In 
spite of all our good will and sincerity, there are many misunderstandings. 
Hopefully authors and searchers are now moving closer and closer to the 
original Chinese sources.</p> 
<p><strong>BBC:</strong> Then is our actual practice of Chinese medicine wrong?
</p> 
<p><strong>PHS:</strong> No, but it is incomplete. We are at the beginning. We 
are the pioneer generation and we have everything to build. This is not a 
tragedy ... on the contrary, it is a fantastic opportunity! Since both the 
recognition of Chinese medicine in Europe and an MD/PhD track in the U.S. are 
hot topics, it would be fitting for us to focus on the quality of existing 
training courses. For the next few decades, our attention should be on quality 
rather than quantity. In order to promote the practice of Chinese medicine, it 
would be much better to have a handful of well-trained, effective practitioners 
than thousands of superficially-trained, mediocre ones.</p> 
<p><strong>BBC:</strong> Historically, quite unique traditions of CM developed 
in various Asian nations. Have you seen a difference between practitioners in 
various non-Asian countries? For example, how are European practitioners 
different from American or Australian practitioners?</p> 
<p><strong>PHS:</strong> I can speak for Europeans and Americans, and there is 
no major gap between them. But serious issues still remain ... Most 
practitioners approach Chinese medicine far too mechanically. They find it 
difficult to establish a diagnosis - to &quot;think Chinese.&quot; Many 
prescribe formulas without ever being truly creative in the act of healing 
&middot; but they are all enthusiastic, sincere and motivated, and this is why 
I foresee a fantastic future for our profession.</p> 
<p><strong>BBC:</strong> What do you want to achieve most as a writer, teacher 
and healer?</p> 
<p><strong>PHS:</strong> Like many others, my mission is to transmit a more 
traditional vision of Chinese medicine. Up to now, I have written rather 
technical, practical and clinical books. This is just the first step. I am much 
more interested in the heart of Chinese medicine than in its facade. My 
research is headed that way. My concern as a healer is not only to relieve 
patients of their illness, but also to help them understand the origin of their 
suffering. And this is fascinating.</p> 
<p><strong>BBC:</strong> Is there a historical doctor that you strive to 
emulate?</p> 
<p><strong>PHS:</strong> I am impressed by many great masters. How can we not 
look up to someone like Zhang Ji, who invented &quot;scientific&quot; Chinese 
medicine? How can we not admire the wisdom of Sun Si Miao, the erudition of Li 
Shi Zhen, the creativity of Zhang Jie Bin, the clinical skill of Ye Tian Shi, 
the humanism of Xu Da Chun, the knowledge of He Men Yao, and so many others? 
The history of Chinese medicine's ideas transmitted through its great masters 
is simply amazing.</p> 
<p><strong>BBC: </strong>What is your opinion of the various forms of herbs on 
the market? Do you think patent formulas (tinctures and pills) are better than 
nothing?</p> 
<p><strong>PHS: </strong>Yet another delicate question! Science has proven 
that any kind of medical intervention, even placebo, induces a 40% improvement. 
These pills and tinctures actually do give at least 40% noticeable results 
&middot; However, I believe that the goal of medicine is to obtain better than 
placebo results, or else we should just give our patients sugar pills! All the 
good practitioners I've seen, without exception, prescribe decoctions. All the 
&quot;miracle cures&quot; performed by Chinese medicine I've witnessed were 
from decoctions. I have never seen any of my Chinese teachers prescribe 
ready-made pills to a patient, yet some formulas taste just as bitter to the 
Chinese! If we wish to become a real profession, we should stay on the right 
track and do what must be done to succeed.</p> 
<p><strong>BBC: </strong>How would you sell CM practitioners on the idea of 
learning to create these customized herbal formulations (raw herb, powders)?</p>
<p><strong>PHS:</strong> I am convinced there is just no other option. I 
prescribe customized raw herb formulas in my own clinical practice. This is the 
traditonal way of practicing this art. The practitioner exerts his skill in his 
modifications of the formula. Standard formulas rarely, if ever, fit the 
complexity of the patients we see in practice. Low-dosage pills were intended 
for self-medication; they don't belong in professional practice. And there's no 
hope for a practitioner to become aware of the huge difference between these 
pills and customized decoctions prescribed at therapeutic dosages. Being 
pioneers doesn't give us the right to act as we please. We must never forget 
that this is really about people's health.</p> 
<p><strong>BBC: </strong>Your Blue Poppy Press bio says that your main passion 
is to help people who are suffering. Is there a particular patient you can 
think of whose healing has meant more to you than any other?</p> 
<p><strong>PHS:</strong> Many people have left their mark and helped me grow. 
Significantly improving a patient's life is always a rewarding experience. I 
pay close attention to my failures because, in trying to understand what went 
wrong, they help me to improve. On the other hand, we should remain very humble 
when faced with a spectacular result. Practicing medicine is such a difficult 
art. It is a very demanding profession - to such an extent that I thank God 
each time a patient improves.</p> 
<p><strong>BBC:</strong> In order to make time for writing, speaking and 
traveling, do you have to pick and choose the cases you take on? What kind of 
case are you more likely to get excited about versus refer out?</p> 
<p><strong>PHS: </strong>I don't actually travel or do conferences a lot, and 
writing is a long-term effort that leaves me enough time for clinical practice, 
so I don't have to be selective, but I do prefer patients who live near my 
practice. Healing people involves taking their care seriously, following their 
progress attentively and taking the problem in hand; it has nothing to do with 
seeing them once and then only being in touch by telephone. If Chinese medicine 
is to become a real medical profession in the Western world, we must follow the 
rules of medical ethics. Patient follow-up is one of them. Above all, healing 
is a special encounter between two spirits. That is my favorite part of Chinese 
medicine!</p> Click here for previous articles by Brian Carter, MSCi, LAc.

<b>Conservative Care Beats 
Medication for Neck Pain</b><br>
A study published in the Jan. 3, 2012 issue of

<b>Dealing with Fibromyalgia</b><br>
It is estimated that 
between two to four percent of the population are now suffering from

<br> <b>Careful Coding: With or Without Myelopathy</b><br>
Clinicians must be 
on their toes when it comes to the spelling, pronunciation and definition of 
different anatomical and health care terms. Many terms have similar spelling
