<h2>CAN ACUPUNCTURE AND CHINESE MEDICINE HELP YOU?</h2> 
<p> BY DR YUN-FEI LU<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
 In Australia, more and more 
people are seeking alternative natural healing methods for their health, and 
wonder whether their health problems can be treated by acupuncture and Chinese 
herbal medicine. Acupuncture and Chinese medicine (an ancient medical system) 
are growing in popularity around the world, despite the technological 
advancements of conventional western medicine.<br>
<br>
 While western medicine 
is fulfilling essential roles for the treatment of many illnesses, there are 
still so many health problems which are not satisfactorily treated. Two typical 
examples are the treatment of the age related degenerative health problems and 
the treatment of cancer. Chinese medicine offers a holistic approach to 
decrease the rate of age related physiological decline of the human body. In 
China, most cancer patients are using some kind of treatments from traditional 
Chinese medicine.<br>
<br>
<br>
 WHY DO I NEED ACUPUNCTURE AND CHINESE MEDICINE?
<br> <br>
 While in China it is a tradition for people to seek Chinese medicine 
treatments, here in our western society people seek Chinese medicine treatments 
because of various reasons. From my clinical experience, the main reasons can 
be summarized below.<br>
<br>
 - &quot;Western medicine can not help me any 
more.&quot; Some cancer patients in western medical treatment programs, are 
told that nothing further can be done for them. Including many other medical 
problems, people realizing that they have to continue their medication for 
lifetime to control the health problem and in seeking an alternative method, 
they turn to Chinese medicine.<br>
<br>
 - &quot;I am suffering the side 
effects from western medical treatment.&quot; This is often heard from people 
using western medicines, who worry about long term damage to their body. For 
example, HRT (hormonal replacement treatment) has been used as an effective 
treatment for menopause syndrome, but there are concerns of its side effects.
<br> <br>
 - &quot;I know that acupuncture and Chinese medicine are more 
effective for my current health problem.&quot; These people have usually 
already experienced Chinese medicine treatments or know the effectiveness of 
Chinese medicine from other media sources. For example, acupuncture is 
effective for pain relief in many acute and chronic illnesses, such as 
lower-back pain, frozen shoulder, and many other muscular problems. Acupuncture 
has also been shown to be effective for the treatment of hemiplegia, due to 
strokes. Herbal medicine is effective for the treatment for depression, stress, 
and some gynecological problems, such as period pain.<br>
<br>
 - &quot;My GP 
recommended I see a Chinese medical doctor.&quot; As acupuncture and Chinese 
herbal medicine are more and more accepted in western society, GPs are starting 
to refer patients to seek Chinese medicine as complementary treatments. An 
integrated treatment of western medicine and traditional medicine can be an 
effective method to enhance the treatment result and reduce side effects. 
Treatment of cancer is one typical case.<br>
<br>
 - &quot;I personally am very 
keen on natural and alternative medicine.&quot; Some people prefer to use 
natural methods like acupuncture and Chinese herbal medicine to maintain their 
health and to treat ailments when necessary.<br>
<br>
<br>
 WHAT KIND OF HEALTH 
PROBLEMS ARE EFFECTIVELY TREATED BY ACUPUNCTURE AND CHINESE MEDICINE?<br>
<br>
 
The World Health Organization (WHO) has recognized acupuncture for the 
treatment of over 200 medical conditions. The following are some examples, of 
common conditions which benefit from acupuncture and Chinese medicine, based on 
my clinical experience.<br>
<br>
 Muscle &amp; joints: Muscular pain in neck, 
shoulder, back, arms and legs - such as arthritis, neuralgia, back pain, 
tendonitis, stiff neck, stroke, cerebral palsy, sprains, painful heels;<br>

 Mental-Emotional: Anxiety, 
depression, stress, insomnia, sleep disorders, chronic fatigue, smoking, and 
drug addictions;<br>

syndrome, pre-menstrual syndrome (PMS), urinary disorder;<br>

pressure;<br>
 Respiratory: Flu, cough, asthma;<br>
 Immunology: Allergies, 
disorders of immune system, complementary treatment for cancers;<br>

hyperacidity, ulcers, chronic diarrhea, indigestion, constipation, diabetes, 
eating disorders, weight problems;<br>

Eczema, acne, urticaria, skin dry skin and itchy skin.<br>
<br>
<br>
 
PREVENTION OF DISEASES IS AS IMPORTANT AS TREATMENT OF DISEASES<br>
<br>
 It 
should be noted that prevention of diseases is one of the most important 
features in Chinese medicine. Chinese medicine has been helping people to 
maintain health by using acupuncture and herbal medicine, including a balanced 
diet, and combining various exercises, like Chi-Gong (Chi Kung) and Tai-Chi. 
From ancient China, it was said that the best doctor was the one who was able 
to prevent disease before it occurred rather than to treat the disease after it 
had manifested. Chinese medicine believes that balance and harmony of the 
body's energy (Qi or Chi) is the basis of health. Acupuncture and herbal 
medicine can restore the body's balance before physical illnesses fully develop.
