<h3> Essential Oil - Acupuncture One - Medical Acupuncture, Chinese Herbal 
Medicine</h3> 
<p> </p> From Wikipedia <br>
<br>
An essential oil is a concentrated, 
hydrophobic liquid containing volatile aromatic compounds from plants. It is 
produced by distillation. Other extraction processes to obtain aromatic plant 
compounds include expression, or solvent extraction. Essential oils are used in 
perfumery, aromatherapy, cosmetics, incense, for flavoring food and drink, and 
&acirc;&#128;&#147;to a lesser extent- in health care, and household cleaning 
products. They are valuable commodities to the fragrance and flavorant 
industries.<br>
<br>
Essential oil is also known as volatile oil and ethereal 
oil. It may also be referred to as &quot;oil of&quot; the raw plant material 
from which it was extracted, such as oil of clove. The term essential is 
intended to indicate that the oil is the fragrant essence of the plant from 
which it is extracted and not in the more common grammatical sense of being 
indispensable. It is not to be confused with essential fatty acids.<br>
<br>

The medical use of vegetable oils has a long and distinguished history. Many 
oils that are used medicinally are essential oils, which are distilled rather 
than pressed or otherwise extracted. Medical properties claimed by those who 
sell medicinal oils vary from skin treatments to remedies for cancer, and are 
often based on historical use of these oils for these purposes. Such claims are 
now subject to regulation in most countries, and have grown correspondingly 
more vague, to stay within these regulations.<br>
<br>
Interest in such uses of 
essential oils has enjoyed a revival in recent decades, with the popularity of 
aromatherapy, in which oils are heated and volatized.<br>
<br>
Distillation <br>
Today, most common essential oils, such as lavender, peppermint, and 
eucalyptus, are distilled. Raw plant material, consisting of the flowers, 
leaves, wood, bark, roots, seeds, or peel, is put into an alembic 1 
(distillation apparatus) over water. As the water is heated the steam passes 
through the plant material, vaporizing the volatile compounds. The vapors flow 
through a coil where they condense back to liquid, which is then collected in 
the receiving vessel.<br>
<br>
Most oils are distilled in a single process. One 
exception is Ylang-ylang (Cananga odorata), which takes 22 hours to complete 
through a Fractional distillation.<br>
<br>
The water recondensed from the 
distillation process is referred to as a hydrosol, hydrolat, herbal distillate 
or plant water essence, which may be sold as another fragrant product. Popular 
hydrosols are rose water, lavender water, lemon balm, clary sage, and orange 
blossom water. The use of herbal distillates in cosmetics is increasing. Some 
plant hydrosols have unpleasant smells and are therefore not sold.<br>
<br>

Expression<br>
Most citrus peel oils are usually expresses mechanically, or 
cold-pressed. Due to the large quantities of oil in citrus peel and the 
relatively low cost to grow and harvest the raw materials, citrus-fruit oils 
are cheaper than most other essential oils. Lemon or sweet orange oils that are 
obtained as by-products of the commercial citrus industry are even cheaper.<br>

<br>Prior to the discovery of distillation, essential oils (EO) were extracted 
by pressing.<br>
<br>
Solvent extraction <br>
Most flowers contain very little 
volatile oil to undergo expression and their chemical components are to 
delicate and easily denatured by the high heat used in steam distillation. 
Instead, a solvent such as hexane or supercritical carbon dioxide is used to 
extract the oils. Extracts from hexane and other hydrophobic solvent are called 
concretes, which is a mixture of essential oil, waxes, resins and other 
lipophilic (oil soluble) plant material.<br>
<br>
Although highly fragrant, 
concretes contain large quantities of non-fragrant waxes and resins. As such 
another solvent, often ethyl alcohol, which only dissolves the fragrant 
low-molecular weight compounds, is used to extract the fragrant oil from the 
concrete. The alcohol is removed by a second distillation, leaving behind the 
absolute.<br>
<br>
Supercritical carbon dioxide is used as a solvent in 
supercritical fluid extraction. This method has many benefits, including 
avoiding petrochemical residues in the product. It does not yield an absolute 
directly. The supercritical carbon dioxide will extract both the waxes and the 
essential oils that make up the concrete. Subsequent processing with liquid 
carbon dioxide, achieved in the same extractor by merely lowering the 
extraction temperature, will separate the waxes from the essential oils. This 
lower temperature process prevents the decomposition and denaturing of 
compounds and provides for a superior product. When the extraction is complete, 
the pressure is reduced to ambient and the carbon dioxide reverts back to a 
gas, leaving no residue. Although supercritical carbon dioxide is also used for 
making decaffeinated coffee, the actual process is different.<br>
<br>

Production quantities<br>
Estimates of total production of essential oils are 
difficult to obtain. One estimate, compiled from data in 1989,1990, and 1994 
from various sources gives the following total production, in tones, of 
essential oils for which more than 1,000 tonnes were produced. 2<br>

<br>Essential oil in use in aromatherapy <br>
Aromatherapy is a form of herbal 
medicine, in which healing effects are ascribed to the aromatic compounds in 
essential oils and other plant extracts. Many common essential oils have 
medicinal properties that have been applied in folk medicine since ancient 
times and are still widely used today. For example, many essential oils have 
antiseptic properties, though some are stronger than others.3 In addition, many 
are claimed to have an uplifting effect on the mind, though different essential 
oils have different properties. 4 5 The claims are supported in some studies 
and unconfirmed in others.<br>
<br>
Solvents <br>
Essential oils are usually 
lipophilic compounds. It has thus been found that alcohols such as methanol and 
ethanol (primarily 100% concentrations), or organic solvents such as acetone, 
are the best diluents. Water is not recommended as oil will not usually 
dissolve in water-although minimal oil dilution in water can be attained at 
extremely low concentrations of oil, depending on the viscosity of the oil.<br>

<br>Raw Materials <br>
Essential oils are derived from various parts of plants. 
Some, like orange oil, are derived from any of several parts of the plant.<br>

<br>Berries: Allspice, Juniper <br>
Seeds: Almond, Anise, Celery, Cumin, Nutmeg 
oil<br>
Bark: Cassia, Cinnamon <br>
Wood: Camphor, Cedar, Rosewood, Sandalwood 
<br>Rhizome: Ginger <br>
Leaves: Basil, Bay leaf, Cinnamon, Common sage, 
Eucalyptus, Lemon grass, Melaleuca, Oregano, Patchouli, Peppermint, Pine, 
Rosemary, Spearmint, Tea tree, Thyme, Wintergreen<br>
Resin: Frankincense, Myrrh
<br>Flowers: Chamomile, Clary sage, Clove, Geranium, Hyssop, Jasmine, Lavender, 
Manuka, Marjoram, Orange, Rose, Ylang-ylang<br>
Peel: Bergamot, Grapefruit, 
Lemon, Lime, Orange, Tangerine<br>
Root: Valerian <br>
<br>
Rose oil <br>
The 
most well-known essential oil is probably Rose oil, produced from the petals of 
Rosa damascena and Rosa centifolia. Steam-distilled rose oil is known as 
&quot;rose otto&quot; while the solvent extracted product is known as 
&quot;rose absolute&quot;.<br>
<br>
Dangers <br>
Because of their concentrated 
nature, EO&rsquo;s generally should not be applied directly to the skin in 
their undiluted or &quot;neat&quot; form. Some can cause severe irritation or 
provoke an allergic reaction. Instead, essential oils should be blended with a 
vegetable carrier oil (also referred to as a base or &quot;fixed&quot; oil) 
before being applied. Examples of common carrier oils would be olive, hazelnut, 
grapeseed, etc. Common ratio of essential oil disbursed in a carrier oil is 
0.5-3% (most less than 10%) and depends on its purpose. Some EO&rsquo;s 
including many of the citrus peel oils, are photosensitizers, increasing the 
skin&rsquo;s reaction to sunlight and making it more likely to burn.<br>
<br>

Industrial users of essential oils should consult the material safety data 
sheet (MSDS) to determine the hazards and handling requirements of particular 
oils.<br>
<br>
Pesticide residues <br>
There is some concern about pesticide 
residues in EO&rsquo;s, particularly those used therapeutically. For this 
reason, many practitioners of aromatherapy choose to buy organically produced 
oils.<br>
<br>
Ingestion <br>
While some advocate the ingestion of essential 
oils for therapeutic purposes, this should never be done except under the 
supervision of a professional who is licensed to prescribe such treatment. Some 
very common EO&rsquo;s such as Eucalyptus are extremely toxic internally. 
Pharmacopoeia standards for medicinal oils should be heeded. EO&rsquo;s should 
always be kept out of the reach of children. Some oils can be toxic to some 
domestic animals, cats in particular. Owners must ensure that their pets do not 
come into contact with potentially harmful essential oils. 7<br>
<br>
Smoke <br>
The smoke from burning essential oils may contain potential carcinogens, such 
as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Essential oils are naturally high 
in volatile organic compounds (VOCs). The internal use of essential oils should 
be fully avoided during pregnancy without consulting with a licensed 
professional, as some can be abortifacients in dose 0.5-10 ml.<br>
<br>

Toxicology<br>
LD50 of most EO or their main components are 0.5-10 g/kg (orally 
or skin test).<br>
<br>
Media <br>
In 2006, the German movie Perfume: The Story 
of a Murderer was made on the subject of essential oils. The story takes place 
in France in the 1700&rsquo;s.<br>

<h3> Bojenmi Chinese Tea </h3> 
<p> </p> Bojenmi Tea (Baojianmei Jianfei, Cha; literally, maintain health and 
nice appearance, reduce fleshiness tea) is a popular product of China that has 
been used mainly for weight loss for the past twenty years. It is produced 
under the Egret River Brand of the Xiamen Export Corporation (XMEHECO) in 
beautiful Xiamen, an island of Fujian Province. This herb formulation is 
provided in the form of loose tea and easy to use tea bags. The main ingredient 
is tea leaf from Fujian Province (reported to be 50% of the product contents), 
which have been shown to help lower blood lipids. An extract of other herbs is 
sprayed onto the tea leaf to make the finished beverage product, which is 
prepared by steeping in boiled water for 3-4 minutes.<br>
<br>
The other 
ingredients are:<br>

<ul> <br>

<li>Crataegus (shanza)</li> <br>

<li>Malt (maiya)</li> <br>

<li>Pharbitis (qianniuzi)</li> <br>

<li>Pogostemon (huoxiang)</li> <br>

<li>Hoelen (fuling)</li> <br>

<li>Citrus (chenpi)</li> <br>

<li>Alisma (zexie)</li> <br>

<li>Cassia (juemingzi)</li> <br>

<li>Phaseolus (chixiaodou)</li> <br>

<li>Shen-chu (shenqu)</li> <br>

<li>Raphanus (laifuzi)</li> <br>
</ul> <br>
These herbs are traditionally used 
to enhance digestion, remove food stagnation, resolve accumulations pf phlegm 
and moisture, and provide a slight laxative action. The combination includes 
the four primary therapeutic actions relied upon by Chinese doctors to promote 
weight loss and reduce blood lipids. Malt, (barley sprout), shen-chu (fermented 
wheat with artemisia herb), crataegus (hawthorn fruit), raphanus (radish seed), 
citrus peel, and pogostemon (patchouli herb) invigorate the digestion of foods 
in the stomach; hoelen mushroom, cassia (red bean), alisma (water plantain 
rhizome), citrus, and pogostemon remove excess fluid; cassia (senna seed) and 
pharbitis (morning glory seed) provide a laxative effect. Crataegus, lisma, and 
cassia reduce blood lipids. The combination of malt, shen-chu, crataegus and 
raphanus was shown, in a clinical trial, to alleviate symptoms of abdominal 
distention, intestinal gurgling, eructation, acid regurgitation and intestinal 
cramping in patients with sluggish bowel function.<br>
<br>
The recommended 
dosage for Bojenmi Tea is 3-6 grams each time (one tea bag contains 3 grams), 
to be taken three times daily, thus 9-18 grams of tea leaves carrying the 
herbal extracts is taken in one day (3-6 tae bags). According to the package 
information, if no dietary changes are made, one can still lose weight, though 
it is best to have a low calorie diet for continued weight loss. Bojenmi tea 
has a mild taste, something like ordinary black tea, with a slight added 
spicy-bitter taste. A small amount of sugar (or other sweetener) can be added 
to alter the taste, if desired.<br>
<br>
A story about the value of ordinary 
green tea in removing fat was told this way: &ldquo;In the Chinese restaurants, 
to clean up the spilled greasy food left after a meal, some of the remaining 
tea is poured onto the table top and then the grease dissolves and is easily 
cleaned up.&rdquo; Chinese physicians point out also that alisma counteracts 
the &ldquo;greasy quality&rdquo; of herbs; because of this property, it was 
thought to reduce excess grease (fat) in the body, which has since been found 
to be true, based on laboratory and clinical evaluations.<br>
<br>
Baojenmi Tea 
is a derivative of the traditional formula Baohe Wan (maintain harmony pill) a 
prescription of Zhu Danxi, originally recorded in Danxi Xinfa (The Fundamental 
Methods of Zhu Danxi; 1481 A.D.) This formula, available also as a patent 
remedy, contains the following ingredients in common with Baojenmi Tea: 
crataegus, shen-chu, raphanus, citrus, hoelen, and malt. The traditional 
formula was indicated for treating stagnant food, eructation, diarrhea, and 
thick coating on the tongue, indicating the phlegm excess resulting from food 
stagnation related to overeating. Bojenmi Tea treats the same conditions as 
Baohe Wan. It contains a small amount of mild laxatives, so that it can treat 
constipation, but it will still alleviate diarrhea that occurs from overeating 
and impaired digestive functions. In addition to rectifying the digestive 
disturbance that leads to accumulation of fat and water with resulting weight 
gain, it also helps conduct out excess fats from the blood.<br>
<br>
Baojenmi 
Tea has its origin in the coastal island city of Xiamen, known as Egret Island, 
because of the many egrets that used to ride there; the river is called Egret 
River, inspiring the brand name for this product. Xiamen is also known as the 
Garden of the Sea and the Green Island, because of its luxuriant plant life.<br>
<br>People began to settle on this island during the Tang Dynasty (618-907 
A.D.). During the Ming Dynasty, it came to be called Xiamen, meaning that it 
was a gate (men) to the grand mansion (xia) of the mainland. Today&rsquo;s 
Xiamen, with a population of over one million, is a famous scenic and historic 
spot, and has become well-known as commercial center. There were countless 
ships and boats sailing in and out of the port there. Since 1980, when Xiamen 
was opened as a special economic zone, skyscrapers and new factories sprung up, 
including production and export of Bojenmi Tea, which won an award in France in 
1986.<br>

<h3> Rodowca brings Eastern science to Greenville area - Acupuncture One uses 
traditional Chinese practice</h3> 
<p> </p> By Rachel Rausch <br>
Appleton Post-Crescent West <br>
July 7, 2006 
<br> <br>
<br>
GREENVILLE- As one who performs acupuncture therapy, James 
Rodowca needs a steady hand.<br>
<br>
Rodowca, a licensed acupuncturist, opened 
Acupuncture One, LLC in 2003 after receiving his Master of Science in Oriental 
Medicine degree from the Midwest College of Oriental Medicine and serving his 
internship with a Chinese doctor.<br>
<br>
Acupuncture is a traditional Chinese 
practice that uses needles to reduce pain caused by numerous health conditions. 
Acupuncture improves the flow of Qi (chee), or life-force, in the body. The 
Chinese believe Qi flows through the body in regular pathways, called 
meridians. Each meridian corresponds to a particular physiological system or 
organ. The meridians connect with the surface of the body at locations called 
acupuncture points. By stimulating the points with needles, sensory nerves are 
triggered and blockages in energy flow can be released.<br>
<br>
&quot;I think 
people have a misconception that it&rsquo;s mystical or weird,&quot; Rodowca 
said. &quot;It&rsquo;s actually a very logical system of health, but it&rsquo;s 
different than Western medicine.&quot;<br>
<br>
Acupuncture reduces muscle 
spasms, decreases inflammation, activates blood circulation, stimulates immune 
function, and accelerates healing.<br>
<br>
Rodowca said that since the needles 
are small and unlike hypodermic needles, the treatments are painless.<br>
<br>

&quot;It feels like a mosquito bite and there are some places where you 
don&rsquo;t feel it at all,&quot; he said adding that for 
&quot;needlephobic&quot; patients an electrical shock can be used instead. 
&quot;We try to provide a very relaxed and soothing environment.&quot;<br>
<br>

In some cases, Chinese herbal supplements, Chinese massage and heat therapy can 
accompany a patient&rsquo;s treatment.<br>
<br>
Rodowca said patients, who 
range in age from infants to the elderly, can benefit from the therapy 
sessions, which usually last about an hour.<br>
<br>
&quot;It (acupuncture) 
provides substantial relief,&quot; Rodowca said. &quot;Many times people can 
cut out their medications.&quot;<br>
<br>
Shiocton resident Carol Struck, who 
has been visiting Acupuncture One for a year-and-a-half, is one of 
Rodowca&rsquo;s clients who has been able to discontinue taking her medications.
<br> <br>
Struck, who suffered from fibromyalgia for 15 years, describes 
acupuncture therapy as a &quot;life blessing.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I lived in 
pain for all those years and now I live without pain,&quot; said Struck, who 
admits she was skeptical of the practice at first and tried it as a last resort.
<br> <br>
&quot;I didn&rsquo;t like the idea of the needles but it&rsquo;s not 
like a needle like a shot,&quot; she said.<br>
<br>
Struck said she began 
seeing results after a few sessions and now goes to Rodowca every three or four 
weeks.<br>
<br>
&quot;It stays with you. It doesn&rsquo;t just leave when you 
walk out of the office,&quot; she said, adding that she&rsquo;s recommended 
Rodowca to others. &quot;He&rsquo;s very knowledgeable and he&rsquo;s a great 
listener and he&rsquo;s fun. He&rsquo;s got a great sense of humor.&quot;<br>

<br>Rodowca said acupuncture also is considered a preventive form of medicine, 
giving this analogy:<br>
&quot;A Western doctor is like the mechanic that 
repairs or replaces and an acupuncturist is like a gardener where everything is 
interrelated. We look at the body as a whole and we try to prevent imbalances. 
The goal is to get the body back into homeostasis.&quot;
