Thoughts on Successful Application 
of Guang Ci Tang Chinese Medicines<br>
(The Chinese Medical Report, May 15, 
2008)<br>
 By Junting Liu, L. Ac.<br>
<br>
<br>

<p> Before I came to study in America, I had worked with Integrated 
Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) and Western Medicine in two municipal 
hospitals of Shanghai for 15 years. Now I am engaged in the family practice and 
preventive medicine in the San Francisco General Hospital. To provide my 
patients with a more effective and comprehensive service, I obtained the 
acupuncture license of California. As most hospitals in the USA do not 
integrate Traditional Chinese Medicine in their programs, several years ago, I 
founded a clinic integrating TCM and Western Medicine outside our hospital, 
serving the need of those who believe in TCM and prefer to combine it with 
their Western medicine treatment.<br>
<br>
 From my years of clinical 
experience on integrative Medicine, I have got a deep understanding that both 
Chinese medicines and Western medicines have their advantages and shortcomings. 
By integrating them into treatments, we can make best use of the advantages and 
bypass the disadvantages. To those who are afraid of certain treatment methods 
of Western medicine, Chinese medicine also offers an alternative treatment 
option. Here I share some cases in this aspect.<br>
<br>
 1. A patient was 
diagnosed to have lymph node enlargement and needed to do a biopsy. He was 
concerned of the procedure and came to my clinic for treatment. I prescribed him
Nei Xiao Luo Li Pian of Guang Ci Tang brand. His lymph lump disappeared soon 
after.<br>
<br>
 2. Some patients at their 40's or 50's often feel distress in 
chest, ECG examinations ordered by doctors of Western Medicine do not reveal 
any abnormity, thus a correct diagnosis cannot be reached. In such cases, 
doctors usually just prescribe some pain killers, which do not help much. After 
they came to my clinic and were diagnosed with Traditional Chinese Medicine, I 
found tongues of these patients were dark red and their hands and feet chilled, 
suggesting that their blood circulation is stagnated. I subsequently prescribed
Xue Fu Zhu Yu Pian for them and achieved very satisfactory results. <br>
<br>
 
3. Several female patients used to have dysmenorrheal. Their symptoms included 
abdomen distending before menstrual period and irregular menses. They had been 
suffering from this painful illness for a long time. They went for Western 
Medicine but found Western medicines had too many side effects. After they 
later came to me for treatment, I gave them Yi Mu Cao Chong Ji andXiao Yao Pian 
of Guang Ci Tang and told them to take these medicines three weeks after their 
menses. After one week treatment, their symptoms were relieved by 70%. After 
another 3-6 treatment regimen, most of them were totally recovered from 
dysmenorrheal.<br>
<br>
 4. I also use Guang Ci Tang's Fang Feng Tong Sheng Pian
 to treat patients for different conditions, such as colds with mixed symptoms, 
slight constipation, itching skin and pollen allergy, and obtained very 
satisfactory results.<br>
<br>
 5. With Gui Pi Pian and Xiao Yao Pian, I have 
successfully treated patients with symptoms of insomnia and dreaminess, which 
were caused by stress at work.<br>
<br>
 6. Even more impressively, I used a 
combination ofLing Qiao Jie Du Pian and Bu Zhong Yi Qi Pian of Guang Ci Tang to 
deal with paranasal sinusitis with symptoms of headache and lung Qi obstruction 
in over 50 cases and got remarkable results.<br>
<br>
 The above-mentioned 
successful cases indicate that Traditional Chinese Medicine may deal with quite 
a wide range of health conditions, even for conditions that are not readily 
explained by theories of Western Medicine. Once a disgnosis is properly made 
according to dialectical treatment theory of Tradition Chinese Medicine and 
right Chinese medicines are prescribed, magic result is often to be expected. 
However, two factors are essential to achieve the best result. One is 
prescribing Chinese medicines according to the symptoms. We know that 
traditional herbal decoction pays particular attentions to compounding Chinese 
herbs that play different roles as master, deputy, assistant, and envoy at 
doses adjusted to the condition of individual patients to achieve the desired 
outcome. The same principle also applies to the modern scientifically 
concentrated Chinese medicines. We should pay attention to combining different 
Chinese medicines and adjusting doses even for the same symptom as it may be 
caused by different underlying reasons at different patients.<br>
<br>
 The 
other factor is choosing good Chinese medicines. For brands of patent Chinese 
medicines, their place of origin, quality and reputation are all very 
important. The same Chinese medicine of different brands can have great 
variance in quality. Currently some poor quality Chinese medicines exist on the 
market. As Chinese herbal practitioners, we should be very careful in choosing 
quality Chinese medicines because no matter how skillful a doctor is, it will 
be just one step short of success when poor quality herbs are used by mistake. 
I chose to use Guang CI Tang Chinese medicines produced by Shanghai TongHanChun 
Herbs Factory, a leading TCM manufacturers in China with a history of over two 
hundred years. My clinical practice has proven that Guang Ci Tang is indeed a 
supreme brand that enjoys great praises among Chinese medicine practitioners in 
America. With the constant advance of modern technologies, I believe that 
Chinese medicines will embrace new developments. The future is bright in 
integrating Traditional Chinese Medicine and Western Medicine to benefit human 
health.<br>
