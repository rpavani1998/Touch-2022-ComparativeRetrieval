<h1>One Treatment For IC?</h1>  Submitted by mbrizman on Sat, 03/21/2009 -

<p>Of course there is not one treatment for IC! No. Anyone who knows anything 
about IC&nbsp;<br>
knows how individual this condition is to each person that 
has it. REad my quote from<br>
Hippocrates above! &quot;It is more important to 
know the person that has the disease than the disease the person has.&quot;<br>

<br>IC is no different. I used to think at the beginning of my practice that if 
I could just get smart enough or experienced enough, I could find that magic 
remedy which would make everyone<br>
better from IC. Untrue. The thing I have 
learned about IC and really all chronic disease, is that many people can have 
what may seem like exactly the same symptoms and require very<br>
different 
treatment. Again, it is in the details of the person's history and current life 
that<br>
you may find what is most important and significant to getting a 
person in optimal health<br>
and free of suffering.<br>
<br>
There are many 
products out there that are aimed at the masses, but, in my opinion, despite 
good intentions, this is not such a great approach. People's sickness is as 
different as their individuality.<br>
A person who is sick must be listened to. 
Their past and present must be gone over with a fine tooth comb. The series of 
events and the order in which they occurred need to be established in order to 
frame a starting point for this kind of treatment. A lot of patients and time 
are ivolved as well. Tenacity and patients are very important to the 
alternative treatment of IC.<br>
<br>
That said, this kind of treatment is not 
for everyone. Many people would prefer to go the western medicine route and 
take prescription meds and have instillations. This preference is important and 
significant. A person should absolutely have the freedom to make that choice 
and find the treatment that fits them and the doctor that fits them too!&nbsp;
<br><br>
While some people would be horrified at the thought of an 
instillation, many would be horrified at the thought of taking Chinese herbs or 
&nbsp;supplements--or might not be willing to change his or her diets.&nbsp;<br>
<br>This is why it is so important for information to be available. So, that 
people can make informed decisions about their healthcare and know what avenues 
are available for them to take to find the treatment they choose for themselves.
<br><br>
I know I am very grateful for several local doctors here in LA 
referring patients my way when they have asked for alternatives and I know when 
I have made referral in the other direction those people have been equally as 
grateful.<br>
<br>
Working together as human beings to extend our hand in 
helping a person find options and finsd answers is what makes the human spirit 
so fantastic.<br>
<br>
I count myself in as one person who strives to be such a 
person as I know all of you do.<br>
<br>
We are lucky to have access to so many 
wonderful types of medicine and so much information to allow us to make 
personal choices!&nbsp;</p>
