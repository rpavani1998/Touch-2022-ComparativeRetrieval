<h2> The Swiss Government's Remarkable Report on Homeopathic Medicine </h2>  
Posted by lucas on 3.13.2012 
<p> By Dana Ullman</p> 
<p> The Swiss government has a long and widely-respected history of 
neutrality, and therefore, reports from this government on controversial 
subjects need to be taken more seriously than other reports from countries that 
are more strongly influenced by present economic and political constituencies. 
When one considers that two of the top five largest drug companies in the world 
have their headquarters in Switzerland, one might assume that this country 
would have a heavy interest in and bias toward conventional medicine, but such 
assumptions would be wrong.</p> 
<p> In late 2011, the Swiss government's report on homeopathic medicine 
represents the most comprehensive evaluation of homeopathic medicine ever 
written by a government and was just published in book form in English 
(Bornhoft and Matthiessen, 2011). This breakthrough report affirmed that 
homeopathic treatment is both effective and cost-effective and that homeopathic 
treatment should be reimbursed by Switzerland's national health insurance 
program.</p> 
<p> The Swiss government's inquiry into homeopathy and complementary and 
alternative (CAM) treatments resulted from the high demand and widespread use 
of alternatives to conventional medicine in Switzerland, not only from 
consumers but from physicians as well. Approximately half of the Swiss 
population have used CAM treatments and value them. Further, about half of 
Swiss physicians consider CAM treatments to be effective. Perhaps most 
significantly, 85 percent of the Swiss population wants CAM therapies to be a 
part of their country's health insurance program.</p> 
<p> It is therefore not surprising that more than 50 percent of the Swiss 
population surveyed prefer a hospital that provides CAM treatments rather to 
one that is limited to conventional medical care.</p> 
<p> Beginning in 1998, the government of Switzerland decided to broaden its 
national health insurance to include certain complementary and alternative 
medicines, including homeopathic medicine, traditional Chinese medicine, herbal 
medicine, anthroposophic medicine, and neural therapy. This reimbursement was 
provisional while the Swiss government commissioned an extensive study on these 
treatments to determine if they were effective and cost-effective. The 
provisional reimbursement for these alternative treatments ended in 2005, but 
as a result of this new study, the Swiss government's health insurance program 
once again began to reimburse for homeopathy and select alternative treatments. 
In fact, as a result of a national referendum in which more than two-thirds of 
voters supported the inclusion of homeopathic and select alternative medicines 
in Switzerland's national health care insurance program, the field of 
complementary and alternative medicine has become a part of this government's 
constitution (Dacey, 2009; Rist, Schwabl, 2009).</p> 
<p> The Swiss Government's &quot;Health Technology Assessment&quot;</p> 
<p> The Swiss government's &quot;Health Technology Assessment&quot; on 
homeopathic medicine is much more comprehensive than any previous governmental 
report written on this subject to date. Not only did this report carefully and 
comprehensively review the body of evidence from randomized double-blind and 
placebo controlled clinical trials testing homeopathic medicines, they also 
evaluated the &quot;real world effectiveness&quot; as well as safety and 
cost-effectiveness. The report also conducted a highly-comprehensive review of 
the wide body of preclinical research (fundamental physio-chemical research, 
botanical studies, animal studies, and in vitro studies with human cells).</p> 
<p> And still further, this report evaluated systematic reviews and 
meta-analyses, outcome studies, and epidemiological research. This wide review 
carefully evaluated the studies conducted, both in terms of quality of design 
and execution (called &quot;internal validity&quot;) and how appropriate each 
was for the way that homeopathy is commonly practiced (called &quot;external 
validity&quot;). The subject of external validity is of special importance 
because some scientists and physicians conduct research on homeopathy with 
little or no understanding of this type of medicine (some studies tested a 
homeopathic medicine that is rarely used for the condition tested, while others 
utilized medicines not commonly indicated for specific patients). When such 
studies inevitably showed that the homeopathic medicine did not 
&quot;work,&quot; the real and accurate assessment must be that the studies 
were set up to disprove homeopathy... or simply, the study was an exploratory 
trial that sought to evaluate the results of a new treatment (exploratory 
trials of this nature are not meant to prove or disprove the system of 
homeopathy but only to evaluate that specific treatment for a person with a 
specific condition).</p> 
<p> After assessing pre-clinical basic research and the high quality clinical 
studies, the Swiss report affirmed that homeopathic high-potencies seem to 
induce regulatory effects (e.g., balancing or normalizing effects) and specific 
changes in cells or living organisms. The report also reported that 20 of the 
22 systematic reviews of clinical research testing homeopathic medicines 
detected at least a trend in favor of homeopathy.* (Bornh&ouml;ft, Wolf, von 
Ammon, et al, 2006)</p> 
<p> The Swiss report found a particularly strong body of evidence to support 
the homeopathic treatment of Upper Respiratory Tract Infections and Respiratory 
Allergies. The report cited 29 studies in &quot;Upper Respiratory Tract 
Infections/AllergicReactions,&quot; of which 24 studies found a positive result 
in favor of homeopathy. Further, six out of seven controlled studies that 
compared homeopathic treatment with conventional medical treatment showed that 
homeopathy to be more effective than conventional medical interventions (the 
one other trial found homeopathic treatment to be equivalent to conventional 
medical treatment). All of these results from homeopathic treatment came 
without the side effects common to conventional drug treatment. In evaluating 
only the randomized placebo controlled trials, 12 out of 16 studies showed a 
positive result in favor of homeopathy.</p> 
<p> The authors of the Swiss government's report acknowledge that a part of 
the overall review of research included one negative review of clinical 
research in homeopathy (Shang, et al, 2005). However, the authors noted that 
this review of research has been widely and harshly criticized by both 
advocates and non-advocates of homeopathy. The Swiss report noted that the 
Shang team did not even adhere to the QUORUM guidelines which are widely 
recognized standards for scientific reporting (Linde, Jonas, 2005). The Shang 
team initially evaluated 110 homeopathic clinical trials and then sought to 
compare them with a matching 110 conventional medical trials. Shang and his 
team determined that there were 22 &quot;high quality&quot; homeopathic studies 
but only nine &quot;high quality&quot; conventional medical studies. Rather 
than compare these high quality trials (which would have shown a positive 
result for homeopathy), the Shang team created criteria to ignore a majority of 
high quality homeopathic studies, thereby trumping up support for their 
original hypothesis and bias that homeopathic medicines may not be effective 
(L&uuml;dtke, Rutten, 2008).</p> 
<p> The Swiss report also notes that David Sackett, M.D., the Canadian 
physician who is widely considered to be one of the leading pioneers in 
&quot;evidence based medicine,&quot; has expressed serious concern about those 
researchers and physicians who consider randomized and double-blind trials as 
the only means to determine whether a treatment is effective or not. To make 
this assertion, one would have to acknowledge that virtually all surgical 
procedures were &quot;unscientific&quot; or &quot;unproven&quot; because so few 
have undergone randomized double-blind trials.</p> 
<p> In my view, for a treatment to be determined to be &quot;effective&quot; 
or &quot;scientifically proven,&quot; a much more comprehensive assessment of 
what works and doesn't is required. Ultimately, the Swiss government's report 
on homeopathy represents an evaluation of homeopathy that included an 
assessment of randomized double blind trials as well as other bodies of 
evidence, all of which together lead the report to determine that homeopathic 
medicines are indeed effective.</p> 
<p> The next article will discuss further evidence provided in this report 
from the Swiss government on the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of 
homeopathic care.</p>

<h2> Mistletoe: Not Just For Kissing Anymore </h2>  Posted by lucas on 
12.26.2011 
<p> Mistletoe is a semi-parasitic plant that grows on several types of trees, 
including apple, oak, maple, elm, pine, and birch. It was used by the Druids 
and the ancient Greeks, and appears in legend and folklore as a panacea or 
&quot;cure -all&quot;, being used for centuries to treat medical conditions 
such as epilepsy, hypertension, headaches, menopausal symptoms, infertility, 
arthritis, and rheumatism.</p> 
<p> Modern interest in mistletoe as a possible treatment for cancer began in 
the 1920s and is one of the most widely studied complementary and alternative 
medicine therapies for it. In certain European countries, products made from 
European mistletoe are among the most prescribed therapies for cancer patients.
</p> 
<p> Extracts of mistletoe have been shown to kill cancer cells in the 
laboratory and to boost the immune system and for this reason, it has been 
classified as a type of biological response modifier. It has also been shown in 
the laboratory to prevent the growth of new blood vessels needed for tumors to 
grow, kill mouse, rat, and human cancer cells, and protect the DNA in white 
blood cells, including cells that have been exposed to DNA-damaging 
chemotherapy drugs.</p> 
<p> The chemical makeup of mistletoe products varies, depending on many 
factors, including:</p> 
<ul> 
<li> The type of host tree on which the mistletoe plant grows.</li> 
<li> The time of year the plant is harvested.</li> 
<li> The species of mistletoe.</li> 
<li> Whether the extract is fermented or unfermented.</li> 
<li> Whether the extract is prepared with homeopathic methods.</li> 
<li> The company that makes the product.</li> </ul> 
<p> Mistletoe extracts are usually given by injection under the skin 
(subcutaneous). Less common ways to give mistletoe include by mouth, into a 
vein (intravenous or IV), into the pleural cavity, or into the tumor.</p>

<h2> A Different Way to See Medicine </h2>  Posted by barbara on 6.1.2011 
<p> by&nbsp;Karen Garloch</p> 
<p> Karen Cummings sat in the back row when her hero, Dr. Thomas Rau, told a 
Queens University of Charlotte audience about his unusual &quot;biological 
medicine&quot; practice in Switzerland.</p> 
<p> Rau's ideas about curing disease by ridding the body of heavy metals and 
re-establishing healthy intestinal bacteria are not well-known in this country. 
He visited Charlotte earlier this year at the invitation of Cummings, who 
learned about him the hard way.</p> 
<p> In 2005, Cummings had surgery to remove a tooth with a 30-year-old root 
canal. She had cadaver bone and a new tooth implanted in her jaw. Shortly 
after, she developed strange symptoms - rashes on her back, blisters on her 
head, fatigue and unexplained weight loss.</p> 
<p> Her local doctors could find nothing wrong. Several suggested she needed 
psychological help. For three years, she searched for help, including several 
weeks at the Mayo Clinic.</p> 
<p> Through a friend, she heard about Rau and his Paracelsus Clinic in 
Switzerland and went there for treatment.</p> 
<p> Rau is a traditionally trained rheumatologist who became interested in 
homeopathy and other therapies that make up &quot;biological medicine.&quot; He 
focuses on underlying causes of chronic disease, such as metal toxicity, 
inflammation, and digestive imbalances. His practice also includes dentists, 
based on the belief that dental health plays a role in chronic disease. He 
claims to have cured multiple sclerosis, breast cancer, fibromyalgia and 
rheumatoid arthritis.</p> 
<p> At the Swiss clinic, Cummings had four amalgam fillings and the dental 
implant removed from her mouth. She was also treated for fungal poisoning, 
discovered with a test called dark field microscopy.</p> 
<p> While in Switzerland, Cummings' husband, Steve, also had a checkup. 
Despite high blood pressure and allergies, he thought himself healthy. But 
tests showed his body was also overloaded with toxic metals. Like his wife, he 
had dental amalgams and a root canal removed. He went through detoxification 
and began eating different foods and taking supplements. Today, he says his 
blood pressure is lower than it has been in 15 years, without medicine, and his 
allergies are better than ever, without weekly shots.</p> 
<p> Karen Cummings, 56, feels normal again. She wanted others in Charlotte to 
hear Rau's philosophy. &quot;It's my way of redemption ... I really want to 
give hope that there is a new fresh way.&quot;</p> 
<p> Rau's approach may sound strange to many, but the Queens audience included 
doctors and hospital administrators entrenched in the Western medical world. 
The 220-seat auditorium sold out in 24 hours, and more than 150 copies of his 
book, &quot;The Swiss Secret to Optimal Health,&quot; were sold that night.</p> 
<p> &quot;There's probably something to it,&quot; said Michael Tarwater, CEO 
of Carolinas HealthCare System. &quot;I don't think we should dismiss anything 
out of hand without understanding it.&quot;</p> 
<p> Dr. Bill Cody, dean of the Blair College of Health at Queens, said the 
goal of its Wellness Institute is to &quot;bring forward new ideas, and even 
controversial ideas ...We know the dominant American 'fix-it' model of medicine 
does not work well for all things.&quot;</p>
