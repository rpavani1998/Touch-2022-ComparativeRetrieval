 Linking research and teaching, universities 
are best placed to teach evidence-based CAM.Tulane Publications <br>

<p>Most readers would know of the current debate about universities teaching 
complementary and alternative medicine (CAM). A core question not being 
addressed in this debate is what other institution is better placed to deliver 
evidence-based knowledge of CAM.</p> 
<p>The latest controversy started when a group called Friends of Science in 
Medicine (FSM) wrote to vice chancellors across the country asking them to 
review their health science courses. FSM rightly says that rigorous academic 
standards and evidence for scientific conclusions and health-care practices are 
of the essence and should be the basis of all university teaching.</p> 
<p>I&rsquo;m sure that any university lecturer would agree with these 
principles; most would consider themselves as friends of science in medicine. 
But it&rsquo;s a matter of concern when the debate and terminology become 
simplistic, generalised and uninformed.</p> 
<p>CAM is a term for many different practices and medicines and there&rsquo;s 
scientific evidence for a number of them. Some of the modalities are derived 
from ancient sciences, for instance, and have a very long history of successful 
traditional use. FSM mentions acupuncture as a therapy it considers 
pseudo-scientific and argues that it shouldn&rsquo;t be taught at university. 
But this isn&rsquo;t entirely true.</p> 
<p>There&rsquo;s clinical evidence for acupuncture as effective treatment for 
various conditions, includingmigraines, tension-type headaches and chronic 
low-back pain. What&rsquo;s more, there&rsquo;s a Medicare rebate available for 
acupuncture if it&rsquo;s part of a doctor&rsquo;s examination. Why<em>
shouldn&rsquo;t</em> medical practitioners learn about the evidence for this 
treatment option at universities to increase consumer choices and improve 
patient outcomes?</p> 
<p>The National Prescribing Service&rsquo;s &ldquo;Review of the Quality of 
Complementary Medicines Information Resources&rdquo; can be used to identify 
which CAM information resources are of high quality, evidence-based, unbiased 
and well structured. The use of such high-quality resources is available and 
encouraged at universities.</p> 
<p>In Australia, complementary medicines are regulated as medicines by the 
Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA). The TGA&rsquo;s ambit includes 
homeopathic and traditional medicines, such as Traditional Chinese Medicines. 
According to the TGA&rsquo;sguidelines general and medium-level claims (such as 
the temporary relief of minor self-limiting conditions) for complementary 
medicine&rsquo;s efficacy can be based on certain traditional use evidence. The 
guidelines allow the use of such medicines until high-level evidence, that 
would allow for high-level claims, is available.</p> 
<p>A balanced view in this debate is particularly important because about 70% 
of Australians already use CAM, mostly alongside conventional medicines and 
treatments.</p> 
<p>So the community expects health professionals to be able to provide 
information and guidance about the quality use of<em>all</em> medicines, which, 
according toAustralian&rsquo;s National Medicines Policy, includes 
complementary medicines. To be able to do that, health professionals need to be 
knowledgeable, at least, about the principle, paradigm and available evidence 
for all complementary medicines, includinghomeopathic and traditional medicines.
</p> 
<p>And where else would health professionals gain this knowledge if not at 
university, during their degree? One of the advantages universities have is the 
close relationship between research and teaching &ndash; students are more 
engaged and inspired by research-led teaching, and research is informed by 
queries from students while teaching. Many universities research CAM to 
generate an evidence base or prove their lack of efficacy.</p> 
<p>So why support research but exclude teaching of CAM from universities? 
Aren&rsquo;t we obliged to translate our research results into practice &ndash; 
starting by teaching new practitioners?</p> 
<p>At Griffith University, evidence-based CAM education is integrated 
throughout the whole pharmacy curriculum. Our teaching research has shown that 
pharmacy students perceive education about CAM as a core part of their 
professional degree. We found that CAM research and education had a moderating 
effect onstudents' attitudes towards CAM. The training also encouraged students 
to look at and evaluate evidence and make informed decisions in the best 
interests of their patients.</p> 
<p>We also offer a specifically designed &ldquo;Short Course in Integrative 
Medicine for Pharmacists,&rdquo; which has been accredited for continuous 
professional development. The course addresses the shortage of CAM knowledge 
among practicing Australian pharmacists as identified in a recent Pharmacy 
Guild-funded project, whichsurveyed Australian pharmacists nationally.</p> 
<p>The survey found most pharmacists supported undergraduate CAM education 
(76%), and the majority (85%) were interested in additional CAM education 
themselves.</p> 
<p>Research also suggests that CAM education may also teach practitioners 
greaterself-awareness, improved core competencies (such as evidence-based 
practice), enhanced cultural competency andpatient-centred care.</p> 
<p>So should we turn our back on the consumer-driven trend toward holistic and 
integrative healthcare, or should we work together to understand, research and 
teach different principles, practices and evidence to improve health outcomes 
for customers and patients? I, for one, would prefer the latter.</p> <br>

<p>There appears to be doubt as to the existence of a substantial body of 
clinical research supporting acupuncture in disease prevention and treatment. 
This page contains over 140 studies from MEDLINE indicating acupuncture has 
potential value in well over 100 conditions

<p>As a pharmacist, I understand Professor Dwyer's concerns but it would

believe that he should impose them on either government policy, private medical 
insurance companies or the public -who are opting for integrative medicine in 
increasing numbers. Why does he seem to ignore the increasing momentum in this 
movement and try to destroy it rather than better understand it? Doctors will 
always have a diagnostic, referral and treatment role. They won't be replaced, 
undermined, side-lined or make less money if they embrace integrative medicine. 
What is the problem with expanding their role to accomodate worldwide patient 
trends? Ignoring this, I believe,risks doctors becoming medical dinosaurs of a 
foregone era. Indeed, why should there be less knowledge about CAM rather than 
more? There is an Arabic expression that says, &quot;We see properly with two 
eyes and clap with two hands&quot;. Figuratively speaking, one presumably 
cannot see a whole picture squinting one eye closed nor work effectively and 
provide best service with one hand. I would urge Professor Dwyer to be more 
open to growing worldwide trends towards integrative medicine and use his 
influence to increase research in favour of integrative medicine. In this way, 
he could bring his brilliance in allopathic medicine to the table to promote 
the safe use and a greater undertanding of CAM which he's unlikely to stamp out.

<p>It seems to me that pharmacists such as Farida, have a very deep vested 
interest in the promotion of the cheaply produced (no costly research there) 
alternative medicines most of which rely totally on anecdotal evidence that 
they &quot;might&quot; be effective in &quot;some cases&quot; of mroning 
sickness, headaches, back pain and liver cancer. Tiralongo, also has a million 
(dollar $) reasons to back them. The picture highlights research and teaching 
which MUST be done in that order, to ensure that what is taught is, as far as 
possible, is correct. John Nicol</p> 
<p>The CAM indutry is approaching this back to front. They want us to accept 
their claims at face value without any research to support their claims. I 
think in this day and age we have moved beyond that level and thse who want to 
see these &quot;medicines&quot; on the TGA schedule should be prepared to 
ensure that the appropriate research is done FIRST!!</p> 
<p>Sure, universities ought to be able to say what medicines are useful as the 
main author proposes, BUT, I must have missed the bit where she said they would 
carry out full clinical trials on each and every one of these 
&quot;medicines&quot; BEFORE promoting them as useful additions to our 
pharmceutical list.</p>

<p>Dear John Nicol, <br>
 I'm sorry to inform you that I am not a pharmacy 
owner so I can dispel your incorrect assumption that, to quote, 
&quot;Pharmacists such as Farida have a very deep vested interest in the 
promotion of the cheaply produced (no costly research there) alternative 
medicines most of which rely totally on anecdotal evidence that they 
&quot;might&quot; be effective in &quot;some cases&quot; of mroning sickness,

Sorry John!</p> <br>

<p>Farida, you haven't done much in dispelling this assumption. Where do you 
derive a substantial amount of your income? You may not run a pharmacy, but I 
am quite sure you have a financial interest in the credibility of this 
ludicrous industry.</p> <br>

<p>Pharmacists market and sell medications at a profit - including SCAM 
medicines. There is an inherent vested interest right there.</p> 
<p>While orthodox medical practitioners prescribe at arm's length from supply, 
many other non-scientific therapists recommend &quot;remedies&quot; and then 
retail them directly, at a profit. How can this be ethical?</p> <br>

There is a historical record of the rift that developed between surgical 
medicine and medical preparations or drugs. Because the surgical side of what 
we now know as modern medicine chased the profit in hospitals and excluded the 
then herbalist or drug maker, forming what we now know as corporate 
pharmaceuticals in the late 1920s.</p> 
<p>How ethical was this by surgical medicine to freeze out herbalist after 
working with them for centuries?</p> 
<p>CAM has it's share of quacks, but we both know that there are surgeons and 
medical staff you wouldn't want near you either. Teaching CAM can, if brought 
into the stream and having the alternatives under control could be clever and 
as we would be in a position to demand certain conditions. Now in the form they 
are, run rampant, challenge modern medicine, cause untold damage and operate 
unchecked.</p> 
<p>I mean - homeopathy really? <br>
Chiropractic and vertebral subluxation, 
seriously?<br>
The list is long, as is inappropriate surgical procedure going 
back a hundred years.</p> 
<p>The other issue is do we risk losing the &quot;willow bark&quot; equivalent 
today's of herbalists for example by not being clever? Or failing to bring 
something in the Amazon to full potential early because of the 1920s 
conservative surgical mindset?</p> 
<p>Aspirin is now being shown as the miracle drug of the next century, it's 
uses increase yearly. What are we missing?<br>
Can we say categorically we

does nothing for health, nor is it a science - how can an institution get away 
with such a blatant act of deception. I actually feel sorry for those who waste 
their money studying such courses, and I feel even sorrier for the people who 
then pay the graduates to prepare what is essentially extremely expensive

Medicine should be taugh at universities, have lost view of the big picture of 
what medicine is all about, by instead focussing their arguments on what 
entails scientific evidence based research.<br>
The reason we practice medicine 
in whatever form or research in medically related fields, should be to relieve 
human suffering by providing relief of disease and its symptoms by using a 
method that is most effective, least invasive, most humane, cost effective and 
producing the least unwanted side effects.<br>
The only way to surely do this 
is to take from both sides of medicine the treatment that meets best meets the 
immediate and long term needs of the patient.<br>
Nobody doubts that 
concentrated Western drugs or invasive surgery is nneded and appropropriate 
when someone needs instant pain relief or acute life saving treatment (e.g. 
anaphylaxis, AMI or major trauma). This is where I see the full effect of what 
the advances in western medicine can do in my role as an Advanced Care 
Paramedic.<br>
However I also feel extremely frustrated when I see people 
suffering from chronic or acute illnesses such as sequel to CVA, endometriosis, 
infertility, fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue, pain from injury, chronic 
headaches, etc, for which they have not been able to get relief from using the 
treatments currently available to western medicine.<br>
As recommended by the 
World Health Organization, countries around the world should be incorporating 
both CAM and western medicine into hospitals as well as out of hospital 
setting, using the best mix of therapies to suit each individual case.<br>

Neither medicine has all the answers and neither should they claim too, the 
community will make their own decision in the long run as to which modality of 
medicine they choose to put their faith and dollars into, we should definitely 
encourage medicine research in both areas through increased availability of 
university course to improve the health of everyone.<br>
Before researchers and 
scientists make these fraudulent claims that CAM does not conduct evidence 
based research, look at why indemnity insurance is so massive for western 
medco's and not for CAM practitioners. Western medicine is responsible for 
hundreds of thousands of iatrogenic injuries and deaths per year while CAM is 
only implicated in a handful.</p> <br>

<p>Thank you Marie for your response, you are quite right that CAM is an

Chinese Herbal medications as well as lifestyle and dietary advice most 
patients with the disease states mentioned expect to see quick and long term 
results. In my practice we have several people a month who are able to fall 
pregnant within 1-2 cycles after trying unsuccessfully for a long time, and yes 
we happily work with their IVF practitioner when required, western medicine 
gives analgesia and suggests getting pregnant to treat endometriosis, we treat 
homeostatic imbalances, giving back quality of life, the others work the same 
and it is always encouraged to work with the regime that their GP already has 
them on till this gets altered by the GP when the symptoms have gone.<br>
As 
for Sean, what are you doing in education of nurses if you have such a closed 
mind to what is available for patients, I can tell you that the clinical 
medicine, pathophysiology and anatomy &amp; physiology studied at university 
when I studied acupuncture was of a high level as they cover most of a nursing 
degree as well as their own modality. This is why CAM practitioners are able to 
autonomously diagnose, treat and prescribe.</p> <br>

of course, naming the medicine where appropriate, as to how you would treat 
each of the following conditions:<br>
1. Endometriosis <br>
2. Infertility <br>

3. Fibromyalgia<br>
4. Chronic fatigue <br>
5. Pain from injury <br>

<p>This is not a fair question. As CAM practitioners, we do not treat a 
disease label. I have treated people with all these conditions successfully. In 
fact, I became a naturopath after a naturopath helped me heal endometriosis 
when doctors could not. I am living proof 18 years later that CAM works. For 
those I have treated with each of these conditions, treatment has never been 
exactly the same.</p> <br>

<p>Really Michael, you might want to look at the history of anaesthesia, polio 
vaccines and various other advances of modern medicine. These were used by 
doctors based purely on subjective experience. The scientific basis for these 
treatments was shown much later. Surely this is exactly why CAM should be 
researched and studied in universities. Current double blimd pacebo trials are 
fine for herbal medicine, but modern techniques such as MRI and PET are 
validating acupuncture theory.</p> <br>

<p>Your knowledge of the history of science-based medicine also appears to be 
rather skewed. Modern anaesthesia has come a long way from the days of ether 
because of science - we know which chemicals act at which receptors. Of all the 
medical specialties, anaesthesia would be amongst the best documented as far as 
its physiology and pharmacology. The whole field of regional anaesthesia has 
been revolutionary. Perhaps you MD study did not include the basic clinical 
sciences.</p> <br>

<p>People in other &quot;non-traditional&quot; countries - Russia, China, even 
Germany enjoy more alternative therapies than the pharma-dominated countries 
like ours. And they are none the worse for it. Look carefully at the way that 
double blind placebo controlled studies are designed, and as a traditional 
Chinese medicine researcher, you'll have a case to dismiss them because these 
studies fail to account for the subtle differences in say, the different cold 
syndromes (not all colds are the same).</p> 
<p>They don't come packaged with the side-effects of the drugs: so why do we 
need to stop further investigations into these and blindly buy into drugs which 
often times only give a 15% efficacy and often introduce new complications?</p>

<p>Ms Kirchmajer is correct - people with chronic disease are often exploited 
by &quot;alternative&quot; (not science-based) practitioners. An understanding 
of the clinical sciences would suggest that recording and EEG has nothing to do 
with fibrolyalgia - EEGs record electrical activity WITHIN the brain - and are 
most commonly used for epilepsy diagnosis and to assess therapy.</p> 
<p>Science-based therapy doesn't just mean that the effectiveness should be 
proven scientifically - it means that the therapy should be based on the 
clinical sciences - the way we know the body works. We might not know all about 
every function of the body, but, with research, advanced imaging and advanced 
laboratory techniques, we certainly know more than the 19th centure theorists 
who invented some of these systems which have never responded to new evidence. 
That is dogma, not science.</p> <br>

<p>Homeopathy has no genuine scientific evidence in its favor - it is 
pseudoscientific garbage. It should NEVER be a part of a University course - 
except where it is used as an example of the dangers of non-evidence based 
treatments. The death of Penelope Dingle is a prime example of the dangers of 
this kind of approach to CAM. Homeopathy (and many other CAM treatments with no 
solid scientific basis) should be withdrawn from private health rebate schemes, 
and removed from pharmacies - allowing them leads the public to believe that 
they are legitimate treatments, which they most certainly are not.</p> <br>

<p>In order to research a subject, there must be an understanding of that 
subject at a University level. You don't walk out of pathophysiology or 
neuroscience and into nutrition and forget everything you learnt in the other 
two because someone talks about historical evidence in nutritional practice. 
CAM course do not have a magical effect on intellectual function. You are more 
critical and more interested in the conventional treatments and how you fit the 
whole health picture. For myself, I constantly ask, how could that possibly 
work?</p> 
<p>CAM courses are not just homeopathy, they also cover nutrition and herbal 
medicine, two modalities with a growing body of evidence. The fact that 
orthodox researchers are willing to look at those because they are easy to fit 
into the paradigm is noble of you, but we are happy to develop our skills and 
research them ourselves thank you. No matter what you say about it, St John's

<p>The shortage of pharmacists' knowledge about CAM is certainly a major 
concern! I am irritated by the presence of homeopathy 'remedies' in pharmacies 
and always make a point of berating the staff.<br>
The 'lots of people use CAM' 
argument is rather tired. If the public were better informed about the lack of 
evidence then maybe they wouldn't. As William states, Universities teaching 
this stuff are doing a disservice to the public by suggesting legitimacy and 
also in the longer term a disservice to the students who waste their fees on

That's why the entire body of acupuncture research needs to be examined, which 
is exactly what has been done, with a systematic review of all the systematic 
reviews of acupuncture in 2011 (57 systematic reviews in total - see link 
above). It concluded that acupuncture is not proven effective for pain and can 
be harmful. That 'Acupuncture for migraine prophylaxis' review is a joke,

<p>But when assessing the efficacy of acupuncture, you can't exclude three 
salient sources just because they don't harmonise with your overall narrative. 
I have a large number of extremely serious criticisms of the methodology used 
in acupuncture trials, so much so that objectively speaking their findings must 
almost be regarded as entirely meaningless. But even still, even considering 
the enormous inappropriateness of the methodology applied to these testings, 
the evidence is still in many cases favourable. You can't say that doesn't 
count, you can't say that, because it seems to work in some cases and not 
really in other cases then its the end of the story, close the book, close your 
mind, move on, nothing to see here, etc, etc, etc. Don't leap to an unjustified 
conclusion out of emotive and ideological motivations.</p> <br>

<p>I am not excluding them, in fact they're quite indicative of acupuncture

studies to show a minor positive effect which disappears with higher quality 
research. This is due to many factors such as publication bias, confirmation 
bias, the placebo effect and research bias/experiment bias). Acupuncture is 
also highly implausible, being founded on pre-scientific notions and having no 
convincing evidence for its mechanism of action ( especially since 'sham 
acupuncture' i.e. not even inserting the needle and randomising the locations 
seems to work just as well). Therefore, according to occam's razor, the most 
simple explanation is that any minor positive effect can be attributed to a 
combination of biases and the placebo effect. Given that you yourself admit 
'findings must almost be regarded as entirely meaningless.' and indeed there 
are just as many (if not more) studies showing acupuncture is no better than 
placebo (as in the review of reviews I linked to in my last post), one must 
conclude that either acupuncture has a ridiculously tiny effect which is almost 
indistinguishable from placebo (if so, why bother with it?) or that it doesn't 
work at all (which is more likely).</p> <br>

China, where I know from my own experience and observation that the skill of

success are demonstrated.</p> 
<p>2) Acupuncture mechanism is actually highly plausible. Research shows 
positive association between acupuncture meridians and lower electrical 
impedance and higher capacitance. The metal needle itself may used possible 
because metal is a good conductor of electrical current. There is also very 
high quality MRI research into the effects of acupuncture on brain chemistry, 
which are conclusively positive. Even in rats acupuncture has been shown to 
significantly influence neuropeptide blood levels over and above placebo:
http://nccam.nih.gov/research/results/spotlight/010112.htm</p> 
<p>3) &quot;Sham acupuncture&quot; is not analogous to placebo. Indeed, 
so-called &quot;sham acupuncture&quot; bears a striking resemblance to certain 
techniques in Traditional Japanese schools of acupuncture that are centuries 
old (shallow needling, non-penetrative, alternate acupoint and meridian 
locations, etc), so we can't use the results of such research to claim that 
&quot;acupuncture is no better than placebo&quot; like you do. Indeed, while 
the difference between acupuncture and &quot;sham&quot; acupuncture is small, 
sometimes even clinically insignificant, the difference between 
&quot;sham&quot; acupuncture and no treatment is moderate to large. The data 
indicates significant difference between &quot;sham&quot; acupuncture and fake 
steroid injections, so we must remain open-minded about what is really going on 
here.</p> <br>

<p>I find these arguments about CAM and &quot;Western&quot; medicine so 
infinitely dull. No one ever says the bleeding obvious about medicine and 
medical practices. There are three types:<br>
1. About the same as doing nothing
<br>2. Better than doing nothing <br>
3. Worse than doing nothing <br>
Only 
evidence can determine which category one's claims about a medicine or medical 
practice fall into.</p> <br>

<p>Don't teach it unless it works. By all means, research CAM. Test it 
scientifically. If you find no efficacy then drop it like the medieval nonsense 
that most of it is.</p> 
<p>Acupuncture was thought scientific by the Chinese at the same time that 
used powdered human genitals or tincture of foetus. It's not good just because

<p>As always in this debate, FSM supporters avoid commenting on herbal and

St John's Wort in depression - a natural medicine used effectively for a long 
time by natural therapists like Marie. Are you seriously suggesting that it 
only works now because the evidence has caught up with the practice? The 
argument put forward to remove education in natural medicine is facile at best.

<p>Research into identifying drugs from natural products is an legitimate and 
evidence based process, some of which even occurs in my lab at uni - natural 
products such as plants, sponges, corals etc are extracted and possible drug 
leads identified using a number of assays. Potential drugs can then be 
evaluated in a scientific manner. Crushing up herbs and giving them to people 
is a primitive form of medicine - we have progressed to the point where we can 
synthesise the active chemicals, thus avoiding potential side effects and 
interactions associated with giving people a whole natural product, which may 
contain hundreds of chemicals.</p> <br>

herb based. I do not do homeopathy. There is plenty of proof in regards to the

criticism or responsible dissent by the critics of CAM who have posted in this

<p>I think you mean &quot;hit a meridian line&quot;. Actually it wouldn't be 
&quot;hit&quot;, probably more like soothed a meridian line. Sorry, soothed 
implies that something actually happened, that isn't likely. Guess it should be 
nothing changed. That's not right either, really should be &quot;I duped 
someone into paying me to stand around and spout nonsense.&quot;</p> 
<p>In the context of this article the statement really should be &quot;I, 
Taylor Arbour, believe your spouted nonsense is worthy of a degree in BS.&quot;
</p> 
<p>Real scientists and medical professionals have rigor and validity to their 
courses. To say CAM is on the same level as their degrees is an insult to every 
professional in the industry.</p> <br>

<p>The medicine that is studied in universities is that which has been shown 
to work, more effectively than placebos in double blind randomized trials. 
Until complementary and alternative medicine can meet this standard it 
shouldn't be taught in universities.</p> 
<p>Any arguments around popularity, widely accepted or that it is already 
subsidized through medicare are beside the point. In the case of homeopathy the 
argument of its safety is spurious since in the dilutions employed it can not 
contain any trace of the original ingredient.</p> 
<p>Not saying preference traditional 'western' style medicine over CAM just 
that when both are evaluated using the best tool we have to determine effect 
CAM fails.</p> <br>

<p>I am constantly confused by the rationale behind this debate. In order to 
raise the evidence base for any substance, effective and well designed research 
must be undertaken. In order to have effective and well designed research, we 
need university trained researchers who understand both the historical usage 
AND the hard sciences. In order to have university trained researchers with 
this combined knowledge, we require well developed and constantly evolving

AND the hard sciences. In order to have university trained researchers with

university courses.</p> 
<p>Many concepts and theories are ridiculed in their early stages of research 
despite being sound after long investigation (as anyone who has followed 
Alzheimer's research will tell you for example). Furthermore, breakthroughs in 
science have come from researchers stepping outside the current rigorous 
scientific paradigm in order to investigate (helicobacter anyone? Your lack of 
respect for what the &quot;Gods&quot; of science tell you to do might land you 
a Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine?) or simply making mistakes in research 
(welcome to stress)</p> 
<p>Scientific arrogance is not good science. When you fail to adequately look 
at the limitations of concepts (like EBM), research designs (ineffective at 
measuring multiple changeable variables in an intervention - as commonly seen 
in the practice of homeopathy) and people, you fail to advance research as a 
whole.</p> 
<p>The difficulties experienced in designing trials in the more controversial 
therapies (such as acupuncture and homeopathy) should stimulate scientific 
expansion, not the &quot;this square peg doesn't fit the round hole so I 
quit&quot; mentality that is being presented by some current scientists. We 
need a new, rational and comprehensive approach, to measure therapies that are 
creating results in the real world (not simply because Australians are 
gullible, non-scientists).</p> 
<p>I, personally, think the scientific methodology has stagnated and is 
failing to adequately adjust to the reality of multiple factors interacting in 
the real world setting. The numerous variety of multiple drug and chemical 
interactions cannot be tested, and yet are posited as safe. The intricacies of 
individualised herbal remedies for a single disease also cannot be tested in a 
scientific trial adequately. It is time for science to move forward, and if it 
takes CAM to stimulate that, this debate is worth having.</p> <br>

<p>Your thinking is naive and flawed, you clearly do not understand what 
science is nor the training that is involved in it.</p> 
<p>The entire supposition that scientists only gain knowledge from their 
degree is laughable. The idea that science hasn't and isn't investigating any 
and all avenues of treatment is also nothing more than a joke.</p> 
<p>There has been a lot of science done on CAM modalities and they have been 
largely found to be baseless. I referred to it as belief in magic in one of my 
comments here, because that is essentially what it boils down to. The things 
that have worked have been incorporated into the wider field of medicine, e.g. 
massage in physiotherapy. The rest has been tried and found lacking and were 
subsequently dismissed.</p> <br>

<p>Ms McDonald, your example of helicobacter is a good one. It's not enough to 
have an idea, you also have ot be right.</p> 
<p>So, what did the discoverers of H. Pylori do? They tested it. They did both 
bacteriological studies and clinical trials - and they had positive results. 
What happened then? It became standard knowledge. That's how science works.</p> 
<p>Examples like homeopathy, on the other hadn are based on a theory from the 
nineteenth century that has never been shown to work, and yet the theory hasn't 
changed. That's not science - it's dogma.</p> <br>

<p>Thanks Evelin Tiralongo for this very calm presentation/overview of reasons

'risk' attributed to complementary medicine use. However CAM is already widely 
accepted by Australians generally, and panic is definitely unwarranted, given 
the generally very safe track record of CAM treatments. CAM looks particularly 
safe when compared to some of the iatrogenic and sometimes fatal effects of 
pharmaceutical and biomedical treatments (last I read about this, only a few 
years back, this contributed to around 18,000 Australian deaths each year). As 
only one form of CAM, Homeopathy has a different 'paradigm' or way of 
understanding how health and illness works, which may make it seem mysterious. 
Nevertheless, it is actually very scientific, and, within its own body of 
knowledge, homeopathic remedies have been extensively tested and proven. Its 
method may - debatably - be proven by reference to quantum mechanics. It is 
commonly used in some of both western and eastern countries in conjunction with 
contemporary western types of health care, especially perhaps in UK, Germany, 
and India, and has the advantage of being relatively cheap for those with 
little money to afford 'extra' health care. Many studies have indicated some 
beneficial effect, and many patients find it helpful.</p> <br>

sprays and say sinus infections, growth spurts etc. one visit to a naturopath 
and we new what and were the problems lied. after that she was put on natural 
herbal medicines - not processed chemical crap and a few basic foods removed 
and she is better than ever. life and nutrition go hand in hand with the bodys 
balance and it should all be taken into account. Modern medicine is useful but 
sometimes it just doesnt cut it. natural therapies are better for the body all 
around. bring on uni studies!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p> <br>

<p>William, can you confirm for me the cure rates to some of today's common 
conditions (asthma, diabetes, etc), as well as the more complex (cancer, etc) 
remedied via medicine?</p> 
<p>From a layman's perspective, until we see unequivocal 'research based 
evidence' of concise cause and cure with (let's be optimistic) 100% cure rate, 
then I'm assuming that medicine is also pretty much in the unproven basket.</p>

<p>This makes no sense Leanne. Not every treatment will work on 100% of 
patients, 100% of the time, nor should we expect it too. But there is a very 
big difference between treating someone with a treatment that has been 
evaluated using the scientific method, and shown to be efficacious some or all 
of the time, compared to treating someone with something that has been tested 
and shown to work no better than placebo.</p> <br>

<p>I love how a senior lecturer at a university can't even avoid making 
fallacious arguments from popularity and antiquity. As a Nutrition &amp; 
Dietetics student, I see how UNcritical my fellow students can be and the 
credibility given to the scam CAM industry by teaching it in universities would 
likely result in health professionals 'converting' to the pseudo-scientific 
side hook, line, and sinker. Teaching this nonsense in universities would also 
strengthen the public's perception of CAM being a legitimate branch of medicine 
(which it is NOT). In my opinion, if any classes should be introduced to the 
curriculum of health sciences, it should be philosophy of critical thinking, 
logic, and argument, which would ultimately result in MUCH greater 
self-awareness and improved core competencies then any CAM teachings could ever 
achieve.</p> <br>

vitamins and such have been taken over by CAM but used in non-standard ways. 
The use of high or ultra-high doses of vitamins is not good therapeutics, and

<p>One has to be very careful when trying to implement teaching about CAM 
within Universities. What FSM is objecting to is teaching *undergraduate

<p>Just because we can test something does not mean we should teach it at an 
undergraduate level *before the results of the tests are in*. Even then, 
testing some elements of a system does not validate that entire system.</p> 
<p>Teaching Pharmacy students about herbal medicines is important. As drug 
interactions with herbal medicines can be an important source of adverse 
reaction. For example St. Johns Wort, although an effective anti-depressant*, 
can cause failure of contraceptive cover, anti-HIV therapy and ant-rejection 
drugs, some of these interactions are potentially fatal.</p> 
<p>But just because St. Johns Worth is an antidepressant does not mean that 
the whole of naturopathy, acupuncture, homoeopathy and the like is validated.
</p> 
<p>One should be very careful about acupuncture claims for its use in headache 
and analgesia are far more tenuous that people would expect. Of 14 clinical 
trails using adequate placebo comparison, none showed any benefit for 
acupuncture. See here for a discussion of why placebo comparisons are important.

</p> 
<p>* Should the herbal preparation actually have any St. john's Wort in it, 
the product to product and batch to batch variation is enormous.</p> <br>

<p>Completely agree with William and Ian. Including quasi-science in 
universities will only legitimise these treatments. We need to educate the 
community about the concept of a placebo, which is all these myriad treatments 
are. It is no surprise when the acupuncturist spends 45 minutes discussing the 
patient's anxieties and fears, the back pain is going to feel better. This is 
not due to the pointy needles targeting energy fields but due to the strong 
(often subconscious) pyschosomatic component of many complaints.</p> 
<p>To claim acupuncture is effective shows a lack of understanding of the 
concept ofnquality blinded trials (with sham acupuncture), all of which have 
shown if is no better than placebo. And I mean true sham acupuncture, not the 
quasi sham in some studies, which has essentially caused unblinding.</p>

<p>Despite this review supporting the position of acupuncture in this debate, 
I feel further study is needed to rule out for the same reasons as suggested by 
the authors.</p> 
<p>There are all levels of research being published, including, my favourite, 
ghost written studies supporting anti-depressant use in children based on 
studies that did not occur. It is perhaps testament to the publish or perish 
motive in modern academia that so many are, as you point out, not well 
controlled. There are serious issues in modern research that need to be 
addressed. That doesn't mean we stop researching</p> <br>

<p> The rest of the abstract reads <br>
&quot;However, this could be 
attributed to placebo effect and the small number of trials included in the 
review. Larger studies are necessary to confirm the results. Acupuncture may 
have potential harmful effects in early pregnancy and hence clinicians should 
be cautious when giving advice regarding the use of acupuncture in early 
pregnancy.&quot;</p>

<p>Angela, you are doing well! These arrogant morons claim that the 
peer-reviewed evidence gives them the right to oust from universities the 
world's safest, time-tested, inexpensive and most efficacious medicines 
(nutrient, herbal, mineral and otherwise natural therapies); and yet, when you 
provide them a site that houses over 18,000 studies sourced directly from the 
National Library of Medicine all they can do is try to discredit the source. It 
reflects just how consensus and not evidence-based their model is, which is to 
say, based on a will to power and not compassion or truth.</p> <br>

<p>This isn't about teaching an alternative, it is about teaching magic to 
kids.</p> 
<p>I'm sure that day one of CAM courses will be to memorise Harry Potter and 
make sure they have brought their wand. Because after how long these CAM 
methods have supposedly been practiced, you would expect to see some actual 
evidence rather than magical assumptions of their mechanisms.</p> 
<p>It shouldn't be too much to ask to demand scientific and rational merit to 
university degrees. Even philosophy degrees are still based around logic and 
reason, not belief and magic.</p> <br>

thing to do and this fallacy-filled opinion piece (argumentum ad populum, 
argumentum ad antiquatatem, false balance/compromise...) is ironic evidence of 
a need for critical thinking skills and basic science to be (better) taught in 
universities, not CAM.</p> <br>

<p>Wolfgang Ernst Pauli the Austrian theoretical physicist and pioneer of 
Quantum Physics coined a phrase which can be used to describe the 
pseudo-science presented here in favour of CAM.</p> 
<p>Pauli could be scathing in his dismissal of any theory he found lacking, 
labeling it &quot;utterly wrong&quot;.</p> 
<p>However his most severe criticism he reserved for theories so inadequately 
presented as to be un-testable or un-falsifiable and so not belonging within 
the realm of science.<br>
<br>
He described such theories by saying; &quot;Not 
only is it not right, it's not even wrong!&quot;</p> 
<p>I would like to see those universities, who are embracing pseudo-science, 
apply a little more rigour to their science.<br>
As a health consumer there

Same as 
the patterns I've seen over the years, of fad diagnoses:<br>
-in the 80s it was 
candida<br>
-in the 90's it was chronic fatigue <br>
-in the last decade it was 
parasites,followed by &quot;alkalizing&quot; which is still in vogue.And lately 
its the detox.Great!! lets mis-educate people into thinking they are full of 
toxins and do not much more than produce a few more bowel movements so they 
think they are now clean.And to think this is happening daily throughout the 
country on a daily basis.<br>
It pains me to have to say this because i know so 
many well meaning and caring naturopaths,but this is terribly misguided.<br>

I've listened to thousands of people in the course of my career.Some get better 
with CAM,so try this or that,and some don't get results.My impressions have 
been that it's hit and miss.<br>
Will a CAM University degree stop these 
practices? Will it teach its students to think critically enough to stop them 
using live blood analysis,mora and vega machines,kinesiology,detox foot 
patches,colonics,the latest fad diets and food fetishes.Are these really the 
&quot;choices&quot; in healthcare that we should be promoting?<br>
Some 
critical self appraisal is long overdue.Because what has been obvious to a lot 
of people is that this falls well short of science ,despite CAM's popularity 
and the positive results that some people have.<br>
The criticisms of this 
industry are valid and we would do well to respond to these and not reject 
evidence as it comes in.<br>
I'll conclude by saying that a medical degree with 
an evidence based CAM<br>
as a post grad is the way to go for anyone who wants 
to give medical advice.</p> <br>

<p>Integrative Medicine is the combination of allopathic medicine and CAM. I 
believe both play important roles in treating the whole person from not just a 
physical dimension- but also emotionally, spiritually and 
mentally.Unfortunately, rigorous scientific testing doesn't seem to me to be 
making real in-roads with any other dimension other than the physical. And even

Strangely enough, th e &lsquo;real scientists&rsquo;amongst us (with so much 
criticism of CAM) don&rsquo;t seem to be mentioning these and other issues 
about rigourously scientifically tested medicines:<br>
-that the body regards 
drugs as toxins so we need to continue dosing to maintain 
&quot;therapeutic&quot; levels<br>
-the side-effects of drugs <br>
-illness 
caused by drugs<br>
-deaths caused by drugs <br>
-that testing doesn't seem so 
impressive regarding long term projecture. If I recall rightly, wasn&rsquo;t 
&lsquo;the pill&rsquo; toted as one of the 'safest' drugs all those years ago?
<br>- the cancers that hormonal preparations could cause. <br>
- that for many 
years methadone was given to heroin addicts with seemingly little or no 
improvement or possibly be the cause of death taken in combination with street 
drugs<br>
-the terrible toxicity of the drugs given to immunologically 
comprised cancer patients. Just what they needed, I suppose. Giving toxins to a 
severely ill patient makes perfect sense -right?<br>
-And I think I recall 
benzodiazepines prescribed by the bucket load. Now, I wonder what created so 
many benzo addicts with rebound insomnia? All good in the name of good science, 
right lads?<br>
-Yes, I suppose rigorous medical testing can also effectively 
measure and cure the emotional and stress related aspects of disease? What 
emotional aspect? Who's talking emotions? So, unscientific!! Can&rsquo;t 
measure that!<br>
-Yes, and of course, there are never any dispensing errors, 
over-prescribing, wrong prescribing , drug interactions or mal-practice to 
speak of- not in the world of real science and real scientists.<br>
-And 
despite thorough and rigorous testing, there are never any drug recalls, faulty 
or contaminated batches or withdrawls from the market.That is just what happens 
with 'pseudo-science'- if you say so.<br>
-and the list goes on..... <br>

Thankfully, many Australians can see that both forms of medicine have their 
advantages and disadvantages. And this is the very reason why integrative 
medicine is so sought after, successful, increasingly being taught around the 
world and used by some 70% of Australians. They work in synergy! And, 
Australians are voting with their pockets! Now, tell me, are about 70% of 
Australians really being conned by shalatan integrative medicine 
pseudoscientists? Let me see,, where's that reality check device? Damn, I can't

and has exactly the same issues. St. Johns Wort has the same side effect 
profile as standard SSRI's and has serious drug interaction problems.</p> 
<p>And so on. Every herbal product that has an active ingredient has side 
effect issues. And the issues of dispensing errors overprescribing and so on 
are exactly the same. Worse, because people don't see these things as drugs 
they don't take appropriate precautions.</p> 
<p>And it's not just herbs. Aromatherapy has problems with sensitisation and 
allergy. Acupuncture has infection and pnemothorax as side effects. Only 
homopathy has no more side effects than placebo, and that's because its 
basically distyilled water (or sugar tables), with no therapeutic benefit

shown to be sometimes disingenuous. I would appreciate an outline of the 
results of trials of those traditional medicines as well as arteminisin that 
are effective .To claim that CAM practitioners always or even usually refer 
patients with serious conditions to mainstream practitioners is just not 
convincing - there are many anecdotes that say otherwise .</p> <br>

<p>Has anyone mentioned psychologists? They are CAM practitioners, and the 
medical professionals refer patients to practitioners. Medicare rebates are 
also available with this referral.</p> <br>
