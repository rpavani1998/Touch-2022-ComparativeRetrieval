 Wow! I am so excited. The article looks great. I love that you linked 
the book titles to Amazon.com and that the reader can jump to areas of the 
article. I also liked that you emboldend sentences and phrases in the article. 
Thanks for enriching the writing like that.<br>
 Stay Well,<br>

<h2>Write for The Pulse of Oriental Medicine!<br>
<i><br>
 An Invitation from 
Brian Carter</i></h2> <br>
<br>

<p><b><br>
<br>
 Write for the General Public.</b></p> 
<p><b>The Pulse's mission</b><i> </i>is to make alternative medicine easy and 
practical for regular folks. By focusing on Chinese Medicine, we advance the 
Chinese Medicine profession in the U.S. and internationally.</p> 
<ul> 
<li>How will Pulse Writers Benefit?</li> 
<li>Commitment</li> 
<li>Column Topics</li> 
<li>Article Topics</li> 
<li>Writing Guidelines</li> 
<li>Editing</li> 
<li>What You Do, What We Do</li> </ul> &nbsp; 
<h2>How will Columnists Benefit?</h2> <br>
<br>

<ol> 
<li><b>Build Your Practice, Drive Your Career Forward</b>. You will reach a 
large growing audience of the general public (GP). We get about 50,000 unique 
visitors per month as of October, 2004. Some of these people will become your 
patients. And, if you plan to write books to the general public, this is a 
great way to get started.<br>
</li> 
<li><b>Become a PRO at Talking to the GP</b>. The language we prefer at the 
Pulse is quite different from what you'll read in the professional journals. If 
you don't yet know how to write this way, you'll soon learn!</li> 
<li><b>Writers will receive feature status</b> in the Pulse's <i>Practitioner 
Locating database</i>. This locator receives more general public traffic than 
any other (patients not peers!), and featured acupuncturists (that's you) are 
more likely to get the patients. Everyone who lists here gets from a few 
prospect calls a month, to a few a week. I've found it a much better option 
than yellow pages, etc. We charge practitioners who don't write an article $95 
a year to list with us. You can get in there just by writing a 1000 word 
article.</li> 
<li><b>You Keep Your Copyright </b>(some mags don't let you!). You are free to 
re-publish and distribute your work<i> </i>anywhere anytime.</li> 
<li><b>Get in on the Ground Floor</b>. Actually, I hope the PULSE is on the 
second or third floor by now...</li> </ol> 
<h3>Article Topics</h3> 
<p><b>You are free to choose</b> any disease, condition, herb, modality, etc. 
that you want to focus on. Check the Pulse's existing articles to see if your 
topic is new (go to the main page and use the search box). Even if it isn't, 
you may have a new angle (e.g. if you want to cover vitamin and mineral 
treatments for schizophrenia; at the time of this writing, there is a 
schizophrenia article, but it does not include vitamin and mineral 
information). In that case, go ahead!</p> 
<h3>Writing Guidelines</h3> 
<ul> 
<li><b>Word count</b> per article: 1000-1500 words.</li> 
<li><b>Style</b>: Use and develop your own voice within these parameters:<br>
 
i.<b>Be</b> personable, simple, fun, interesting, relevant, deep, and inspiring.
<br> ii. <b>Keep the technical discussions</b> of TCM pathomechanisms to a 
minimum or even to zero; if it requires more than a paragraph of background, 
don't go there! What interests acupuncturists and students is likely to get the 
'back' button from the general public.<i>Our goal is to give readers digestible 
soundbites to chew on, not to turn them into TCM practitioners</i>. If they 
want more, they'll ask for it.<br>
 iii. Since I've been writing about OM for 
the public for 3 years, I may have other unconscious and semiconscious wisdom 
in this regard that will not emerge until I'm editing your article. I will 
discuss these issues with you before we publish it. If you have ideas to add, 
or a good rationale for your approach, I will welcome your thoughts!</li> 
<li><b>Possible formats</b>:<br>
 i. <i>Q&amp;A</i> - Answer a real patient 
question<br>
 ii. <i>Story</i> - Tell your own, or a patient's story<br>
 iii. 
<i>Resource</i> - Factually oriented info, a comprehensive article or set of 
articles<br>
 iv. <i>Suggest Another!</i></li> 
<li><b>Elements of any article</b><br>
 i. <i>Analogies, metaphors, similes</i>
 - Keep the reader's attention and make yourself clear by using one of these 
devices.<br>
 ii. <i>Statistics, chinese pattern diagnosis, oriental medical 
treatment, basic western medical info, lifestyle, diet solutions, herbs, 
vitamins and minerals</i> etc.<br>
 iii. <i>Comparison</i> of western and 
eastern diagnosis and treatment<br>
 iv. Always use <i>the word 'you' </i>
instead of 'one' etc. - it's more personal that way.<br>
 v. Provide <i>links
</i> to any websites or resources you use in writing. If you copy text from 
somewhere else without quoting it, that's plagiarism and<i>plagiarism is 
baaaaad.</i></li> </ul> &nbsp; 
<h3>Editing</h3> 
<p>Since the Pulse is a web-resource, our word-choice often is guided by what 
terms the public searches for most often. For example, I think 'Oriental 
Medicine' is a more accurate description of our medicine, but people</p> <br>

actually search for 'Chinese Medicine' 15 times as often! Since I found that 
out, I've been writing 'Chinese Medicine.' However, we can use both terms to 
meet them where they're at and take them where we want them to be. By the way, 
that's called edumucation. You are not responsible to choose words in this way; 
our editors will make this change for you (while of course preserving your 
article's style and strengths). <br>
<br>

<h3><b>What you do:</b></h3> 
<ul> 
<li><b>Email us your article</b> in text only, MS Word, or HTML format one 
month ahead of time</li> 
<li><b>Email us any gif's or jpg's</b> you want to include (sending them as 
part of a Word document is ok for reference, but we still need the gif or jpg 
sent as an email attachment).</li> 
<li><b>Keep in touch</b> if you have a reasonable emergency or are running 
late. Missed deadlines without contact or too many late articles mean your 
writer spot opens up to someone who really wants to write for the Pulse.</li> 
</ul> 
<p><b>What I do:</b></p> 
<ul> 
<li>Edit for grammar and audience.</li> 
<li>Put the article into Pulse's HTML format.</li> 
<li>Optimize the article and HTML for relevant Search Engine keywords and 
submit the article to the Search Engines.</li> </ul>
