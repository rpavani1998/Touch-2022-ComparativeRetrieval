<h3>Evidence that honey speeds wound healing</h3> 
<p>Friday October 19th, 2007</p> 
<p>A new review has found considerable support for the use of honey in wound 
healing.</p> 
<p>The findings, published in the October issue of the International Journal 
of Clinical Practice, covered 18 studies.</p> 
<p>Lead researcher Dr Fasal Rauf Khan from North West Wales NHS Trust in 
Bangor, UK, explains: &quot;Researchers started to document the wound healing 
properties of honey in the early 20th century, but the introduction of 
antibiotics in 1940 temporarily halted its use.</p> 
<p>&quot;Now concerns about antibiotic resistance, and a renewed interest in 
natural remedies, have prompted a resurgence in the antimicrobial and wound 
healing properties of honey.&quot;</p> 
<p>He says that honey has many properties which may offer protection against 
bacterial growth, including gluconic acid which creates an acidic environment, 
and hydrogen peroxide. &quot;It can be used to sterilise infected wounds, speed 
up healing and impede tumours, particularly in keyhole surgery,&quot; he says, 
adding that honey has also been shown to reduce inflammation and swelling.</p> 
<p>However, Dr Khan adds that patients should always check with a doctor 
before applying any substance to post-operative wounds.</p> 
<p>When it is safe to do so, he recommends that honey is applied at regular 
intervals, from hourly to twice daily. In this way, wounds can become sterile 
in three to ten days.</p> 
<p>&quot;The research suggests that honey seems to be especially indicated 
when wounds become infected or fail to close or heal. It is probably even more 
useful for healing the wounds left by laparoscopic surgery to remove 
cancers.&quot;</p> 
<p>&quot;Our research suggests that surgeons should seriously consider using 
honey for post-operative wounds and offer this to patients,&quot; he concludes.

<h3>Fish oil important during pregnancy</h3> 
<p>Friday October 19th, 2007</p> 
<p>Researchers have found that pregnant women who consume fish oil may protect 
their children against allergies.</p> 
<p>Omega-3 fats are present in oily fish and have long been associated with 
health benefits. In this study, Dr Malin Fageras-Bottcher and colleagues from 
Linkoping University, Sweden, examined infants whose mothers ingested a fish 
oil supplement from the 25th week of pregnancy until the third month of 
breastfeeding.</p> 
<p>A total of 145 women took part, half of whom were given the supplement , 
and half a placebo of soybean oil. The families were deemed to be at high risk 
of allergy and asthma.</p> 
<p>Compared with other one-year-olds, the &quot;fish oil&quot; children had 
&quot;considerably fewer allergic reactions&quot;. They had less than half as 
many reactions to eggs at the age of one year. The team say this is crucial, as 
egg allergy often predicts later eczema and asthma.</p> 
<p>In immune tests, it was found that the women who were given fish oil had 
less prostaglandin E2 in their blood. This substance triggers allergic immune 
responses, and has previously been shown to reduce as omega-3 intake increases.
</p> 
<p>Dr Fageras-Bottcher commented: &quot;We have been able to show that 
omerga-3 influences the mother's immunological profile in a less inflammatory 
direction. Theoretically this can also affect the child's immune system, which 
is supported by the results of the scratch-tests.&quot;</p> 
<p>The children, now two years old, are being tested for milk and cat 
allergies and eczema. Further study will include immune examinations. The team 
plans to follow the group for many years.</p>

<h3>Aspirin may not help female heart</h3> 
<p>Thursday October 18th, 2007</p> 
<p>Giving women aspirin for heart disease may do little to protect them, 
researchers revealed today.</p> 
<p>A new analysis suggests that only men benefit from the common treatment.</p>
<p>Millions of heart patients around the world take a daily aspirin to help 
prevent attacks.</p> 
<p>Canadian researchers analysed the findings of some 23 studies of aspirin 
involving more than 113,000 patients.</p> 
<p>They found no proven benefit of aspirin in trials which tested the 
treatment largely on women.</p> 
<p>The most effective use of the treatment was when a study mostly used male 
patients, according to the research published in the on-line journal BMC 
Medicine -www.biomedcentral.com/bmcmed.</p> 
<p>Researcher Dr Don Sin, of the James Hogg Centre, University of British 
Columbia, said: &quot;From our findings we would caution clinicians on the 
prescribing aspirin to women, especially for primary prevention of heart 
attacks.</p> 
<p>&quot;Whether or not other pharmaceutical products would be more effective 
for women is unclear; more sex-specific studies should now be conducted.&quot;
</p> 
<p>He explained: &quot;We found that a lot of the variability in these trials 
seems to be due to the gender ratios, supporting the theory that women may be 
less responsive to aspirin than men for heart protection.&quot;</p>

<h3>Chinese herbs can beat period pain, review suggests</h3> 
<p>Wednesday October 17th, 2007</p> 
<p>Researchers from Australia have found that herbal medicine can be of 
benefit to women suffering from painful periods (known as primary dysmenorhoea).
</p> 
<p>The condition affects up to half of all adolescent girls and women of 
reproductive age. The pain is not due to an underlying medical problem but can 
have a significant impact on women's lives.</p> 
<p>Dr Xiaoshu Zhu of the University of Western Sydney, Australia and 
colleagues set out to discover whether Chinese herbs are an effective and safe 
treatment for period pain. They believe that many women would prefer a non-drug 
alternative to their condition, and: &quot;Chinese herbal medicine offers new 
options for treatment, an individualised approach, and has the potential to 
avoid the harshness of drugs and surgery.&quot;</p> 
<p>The researchers analysed trials comparing Chinese herbal medicine against 
placebo, conventional drugs such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs), 
and other traditional Chinese therapies - acupuncture and Chinese massage.</p> 
<p>They selected 39 trials including a total of 3,475 women. Analysis 
suggested that Chinese herbal medicine gave &quot;significant improvements in 
pain relief when compared to pharmaceutical drugs&quot;.</p> 
<p>It also reduced overall symptoms, say the team in the Cochrane Review. They 
showed that it was more effective at alleviating pain than acupuncture or heat 
compression.</p> 
<p>Dr Zhu said: &quot;All available measures of effectiveness confirmed the 
overall superiority of Chinese herbal medicine to placebo, no treatment, 
NSAIDs, acupuncture and heat compression, and, at the same time, there were no 
indications that it caused any adverse events.&quot;</p>

<h3>Keep babies with mums after diabetes</h3> 
<p>Tuesday October 16th, 2007</p> 
<p>Babies of mothers with diabetes are being put into neonatal cots 
unnecessarily after birth, according to a new report.</p> 
<p>The infants are being separated from their parents because of 
&quot;routine&quot; policies, experts found.</p> 
<p>About half of all these admissions could be avoided, according to the 
Confidential Enquiry into Maternal and Child Health - CEMACH.</p> 
<p>Researchers found that some babies were suffering simply because they had 
not been kept warm enough - and in other cases there was no medical reason at 
all for putting the child in neonatal care.</p> 
<p>The report found that most babies receive &quot;high quality care&quot; but 
greater effort should be made to keep babies with their mothers.</p> 
<p>It also made a series of recommendations to boost breast-feeding. 
Researchers found that two-thirds of babies were fed first with infant formula 
- mostly because mothers chose it.</p> 
<p>The experts said that ensuring babies have contact with mothers after birth 
would help to maintain body temperature.</p> 
<p>Researcher Dr Dominique Acolet, CEMACH director of perinatal epidemiology , 
said: &quot;Babies of mothers with diabetes have more complications than other 
babies and do need careful monitoring.</p> 
<p>&quot;Nevertheless in the absence of specific risks or complications, every 
effort should be made to ensure that these babies can be kept with their 
mothers safely in order for bonding, temperature control and breastfeeding to 
take place.</p> 
<p>&quot;There are many benefits of early interaction between mother and baby 
in general and for these babies as well and hospitals should have policies to 
enable this to happen.&quot;</p> 
<p>And CEMACH chief executive Richard Congdon said: &quot;The great majority 
of babies born to mothers with diabetes these days receive high quality care 
but we did identify a number of problems in our enquiry. More babies could stay 
with their mothers than is now the case and mothers with diabetes should be 
encouraged and supported to breastfeed their babies.&quot;</p>

<h3>New injectable bone replacement developed</h3> 
<p>Monday October 15th, 2007</p> 
<p>A new substance has been created to replace damaged bone in diseases such 
as osteoporosis.</p> 
<p>Amisel Almirall leads a team of the BIOMAT centre within the University of 
Havana, Cuba. She said: &quot;One of the main difficulties of medicine at 
present is the considerable increase of the pathologies related to bone 
problems.</p> 
<p>&quot;Half the chronic diseases suffered by people over 65 are related to 
articulation deficiencies; in addition, the number of bone fractures caused by 
osteoporosis and traffic accidents has doubled in the last ten years.&quot;</p> 
<p>Her work has produced an injectable &quot;macro-porous&quot; cement-like 
material called Calcium Phosphate Cement (CPC) to refill bone cavities which 
occur due to degenerative diseases such as osteoporosis.</p> 
<p>The compound is made of calcium phosphate enriched with tricalcium 
phosphate and porogenic agents such as serum albumin, explains Almirall. It is 
very similar to bone mineral composition and, as a result, it is very useful 
for tissue engineering - &quot;sowing&quot; cells from the patient in the 
material, for re-implantation at a later date.</p> 
<p>It is easy to manipulate, sets quickly and is flexible, Almirall says. She 
believes its use will improve quality of life of patients with fragile bone, 
preventing them from break and allowing better mobility.</p> 
<p>Studies on the compound have been published in the Latin American journals 
Revista Interscience and Revista Iberoamericana de Polimeros. Findings show 
that it is suitable for implanting into bones via injection. The team used it 
to replace tissue after gum cyst removal, which prevented teeth weakening due 
to rapid reconstitution of bone.</p> 
<p>Using a foaming agent (albumen) produces &quot;macro pores&quot; which 
&quot;accelerate the transformation of the synthetic biomaterial into newly 
formed bone&quot;, the team add.</p>

<h3>Healthy heart controversy fuelled</h3> 
<p>Monday October 15th, 2007</p> 
<p>Two new studies add to the controversy about the best way to keep fit 
amidst rising concern about obesity.</p> 
<p>Last week researchers claimed that Britons had abandoned the idea of 
vigorous exercise for gentle strolls.</p> 
<p>Now researchers have shown how a brisk walk and even an afternoon nap can 
help to reduce blood pressure.</p> 
<p>High blood pressure may be a sign of heart disease and can contribute to 
stroke and other illnesses.</p> 
<p>Researchers at Ulster University, UK, discussed their findings, first 
reported in August.</p> 
<p>Researcher Dr Mark Tully said moderate physical exercise &quot;below the 
recommended levels&quot; makes a difference to health. The research had studied 
people undertaking 30 minutes three times a week - in contrast with 
recommendations that this is done five times a week.</p> 
<p>He said: &quot;Falls of a few millimetres in blood pressure and shrinkage 
of a few centimetres in hip and waist circumference are enough to make a 
difference to an individual's risk of dying from a cardiovascular disease.&quot;
</p> 
<p>The second study, conducted at Liverpool John Moores University, UK, 
studied healthy volunteers taking afternoon naps in laboratory conditions.</p> 
<p>The study, reported in the Journal of Applied Physiology, found a 
significant drop in blood pressure just before volunteers fell asleep.</p> 
<p>Those who simply rested awake or stayed standing did not enjoy the same 
reduction.</p> 
<p>A journal spokesman said: &quot;This reduction in blood pressure may be one 
explanation for the lower cardiovascular mortality that some studies have found 
among people who habitually take siestas.</p> 
<p>&quot;The John Moores team will next look at blood pressure during the 
waking portion of the afternoon nap to see if this period may also pose an 
increased danger of coronary mortality.&quot;</p>
