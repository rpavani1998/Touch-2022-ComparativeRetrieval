Good Chinese Medicines Are Good To 
Health<br>
(The Chinese Medical Report, May 15, 2009)<br>
 By Dahe Liu, 
Professor of the ACCHS<br>
<br>
<br>

<p> I graduated from Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine in 
China. I came to America in the 1980s, and soon obtained my California 
acupuncturist license, and opened my own clinic in San Francisco to practice 
traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). I also teach in the Academy of Chinese 
Culture and Health Sciences (ACCHS) since 1988 and currently supervise 
candidates in its master and doctor programs in TCM. After years of study and 
clinical practice, I come to further appreciate the ancient Chinese maxim of 
&quot;a good doctor is someone who is good at both acupuncture and 
medicine&quot;. At present, TCM doctors are officially recognized as 
acupuncturists in America, but anyone who has knowledge about TCM can tell that 
a TCM doctor can hardly accomplish the goal of &quot;curing sickness and saving 
life&quot; without using Chinese medicine. Thus, an authentic TCM doctor shall 
not only be skilled in applying acupuncture, but also be good at applying 
Chinese medicines.<br>
<br>
 Being good at applying Chinese medicines means, 
first, to diagnose dialectically and make the right prescription, and second, 
to choose the Chinese medicines that have supreme quality and efficacy, neither 
of them are dispensable. I was born in a family of TCM doctors and have been 
imperceptibly influenced by what I saw and heard since my childhood, so I 
understand how important it is to make the right prescription and use good 
quality Chinese herbs in practicing TCM. &quot;Good medicine is bitter to the 
mouth but good for health &quot;, as an old Chinese saying goes. Traditionally 
Chinese medicines are mostly made in the form of decoction. Today, people 
hardly drink decoction that takes time and effort to prepare, they rather 
prefer to take the convenient patent Chinese medicines. After a TCM doctor 
gives the right prescription, the key for a successful treatment then lies on 
whether the right Chinese medicine brand is chosen that has consistent and 
supreme quality and remarkable efficacy. After a careful review, I decided to 
use Guang Ci Tang brand patent Chinese medicines for several reasons.<br>
<br>
 
First, they are produced by Shanghai Tong Han Chun Herbs Factory, one of the 
leading TCM manufacturers in China and with a solid reputation; Second, they 
are supreme in raw materials, perfect in workmanship and reliable in quality; 
Third, they are made of pure natural herbal ingredients. They do not contain 
Western medicines and other impurities. They have passed all kinds of tests, 
and thus are safe and reliable; Fourth, they are highly concentrated, have 
shown satisfactory results; Fifth, their innovative tablets are more easily 
absorbed and can achieve even better results; Sixth, they have a great variety 
and reasonable prices. Over the years of my career in teaching and practicing 
Chinese medicine, Guang Ci Tang patent Chinese medicines are proven indeed 
excellent and have become an important companion to me. In my practice, they 
serve an extraordinary role that demonstrates &quot;good Chinese medicines are 
good to health&quot;. To fully illustrate the importance of skillful 
application of Chinese medicine, here I would like to briefly share some of my 
personal experiences.<br>
<br>
 1. Respiratory diseases. Patients who have a 
cold, the most common respiratory disease, normally do not see doctors at the 
beginning. They often come to seek a treatment one week later when, according 
to theories of TCM, the cold of most patients has already entered into their 
inner body, turned into heat, which then causes mild pneumonia or bronchitis. 
For patients having yellowish purulent sputum, I will give themQing Qi Hua Tan 
Pian at high doses to clear the lung heat, resist bacteria, and stabilize the 
condition. If the patient has symptoms such as chronic cough, dry cough with 
little phlegm, uncomfortable throat, or chronic bronchitis, it indicates that 
the patient has a lung Qi and Yin deficiency, which can be treated withBai He 
Gu Jin Wan (Pian). For example, for a patient had been suffering from dry cough 
with little phlegm for three months, I prescribed him Bai He Gu Jin Wan. Three 
months later, his symptom was noticeably relieved.<br>
<br>
 2. Liver diseases. 
The normal solution to treat liver diseases in Western medicine uses antiviral 
drugs and does not employ any other special treatment. But theories of TCM 
believe that it is very important to clear up the damp heat, since virus will 
be very hard eliminated in the existence of damp heat. Therefore, when treating 
patients with liver diseases, even if the lab test indicates for a normal liver 
function, as long as there is damp heat in the liver and gall, I will give 
patientsLong Dan Xie Gan Wan (Pian) to help clear the virus quickly and 
thoroughly. For chronic patients, right prescription should be based on the 
different symptoms of Qi deficiency or Yin deficiency. For those with Qi 
deficiency,Gan Bing Zhi Ben Wan (Pian) can adjust the gastrointestinal system 
and stabilize the condition; for those with Yin deficiency,Tian Wang Bu Xin Wan 
(Pian) can reduce the impacts on the nervous system posed by liver diseases, of 
which the most common symptoms include irritability, insomnia, etc. Tian Wang 
Bu Xin Wan is not only good at treating liver Yin deficiency, but also 
excellent in treating insomnia caused by heart Yin deficiency. As a result, 
Guang Ci Tang's Tian Wang Bu Xin Pian is so far the most commonly used Chinese 
medicine in my clinic.<br>
<br>
 I have to emphasize that, when treating such 
kind of diseases, a dialectical diagnosis and a right prescription are 
extremely important. Once I had a patient who was over 70. At that time, he was 
writing a book day and night, which then hurt his liver and caused insomnia. 
Being very painful, he bought several kinds of Chinese medicines to treat his 
insomnia, but none of them worked. From my diagnosis, he had yellow and greasy 
tongue coating and bad breath and was irritable, so I prescribed him Guang Ci 
Tang'sLong Dan Xie Gan Pian to eliminate the damp heat. His insomnia was gone 
soon after. A year later, I received a call from the patient, who said that he 
got insomnia again, but this time Long Dan Xie Gan Pian didn't work for him. My 
diagnosis indicated the insomnia was caused by Yin deficiency this time, so I 
instead prescribed himTian Wang Bu Xin Pian. He was recovered very shortly. 
This case is just a demonstration of the dialectical theory in TCM - 
&quot;treating the same disease with different methods or treating different 
diseases with the same therapy&quot;.<br>
<br>
 3. Chinese medicine shows good 
results in helping Western medicine treat cancer patients. After a chemotherapy 
or radiation therapy, many cancer patients display symptoms of Yin deficiency. 
That is because the side effects of Western medicines have greatly consumed the 
Yin energy of the body. The most common types of Yin in clinical practice are 
&quot;heart Yin&quot; and &quot;kidney Yin&quot;. We can useTian Wang Bu Xin Wan
 to nourish heart Yin andZhi Bo Di Huang Pian to tonify kidney Yin, both of 
which give rather satisfactory results. Some patients have been taking Tian 
Wang Bu Xin Wan (Pian) for several years, and their immune function and other 
functions are all rather ideal. As long as an impairment of Yin is indicated by 
red tongue, the Chinese medicine may be used continuously. It is safe and 
reliable, and has a positive effect on the recovery of patients. (To be 
continued.) You can reach me at 415-253-3418.<br>
