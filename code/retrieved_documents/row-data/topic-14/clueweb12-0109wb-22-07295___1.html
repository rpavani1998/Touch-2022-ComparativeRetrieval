<h2>Fertility and Gynecologic Problems</h2> 
<p>Women who are having problems with conception, premenstrual symptoms, or 
menopausal issues will often see positive results with Oriental medicine. It 
may be possible to reduce or eliminate the need for Western pharmaceuticals. If 
drugs or hormones must be used, side effects may be reduced.</p> 
<p>The treatment of gynecologic imbalances is a well established specialty in 
Oriental medicine. Symptoms which have only been recently recognized in the 
West, such as &quot;premenstrual syndrome&quot; or &quot;premenstrual dysphoric 
disease&quot;, as well as many other syndromes which are hard to classify or 
tend to involve multiple organ systems, are more exactly diagnosed in the 
Oriental system.</p> 
<p>Western physicians tend to lump disparate signs and symptoms together, 
ignoring those which do not fit into established disease categories. There is 
also an unfortunate tendency to treat patients with different symptoms with 
standardized, routine protocols. Often, these standardized approaches have 
never been proven effective.</p> 
<p>The Oriental system of diagnosis is more individualized, so that patients' 
symptoms and signs lead to a customized treatment. Current practice with 
Chinese medicine for gynecologic disorders emphasizes plant derived medicines, 
so it is important to see a physician with training in this area.</p> 
<p>The use of &quot;herbs&quot; is a specialty area of study in China, and is 
only practiced by dedicated physicians who have pursued advanced training. 
Casual use of herbal medicine by amateurs and storefront &quot;doctors&quot; is 
not tolerated in countries where the value of extensive study and certification 
is understood. Acupuncture is of secondary importance to dietary therapy, but 
can be very helpful when applied skillfully to provide quick symptomatic relief.
</p> 
<p>For women who are experiencing disorders of conception, my own experience 
suggests that acupuncture and Chinese herbology is more effective and much less 
unpleasant and dangerous than hormonal treatments or in vitro fertilization 
procedures. The cost of these procedures is also 40 to 100 times greater than a 
comparable course of Oriental medicine.</p> 
<p>It is not widely known in the U.S., but traditional physicians prefer to 
treat both partners if there are any conception disorders. This is actually a 
very good idea to align and coordinate the male and female polarities. In fact, 
one of my acupuncture teachers from Paris is so convinced of the value of this 
approach that he will not treat for infertility unless the couple seeks 
treatment together.</p> 
<p>In addition, acupuncture and certain dietary changes may be helpful to 
reduce many of the normal discomforts associated with pregnancy. Morning 
sickness, insomnia, fatigue, and mood changes can often be helped, and some of 
the discomforts that occur in the later stages of pregnancy, such as back and 
pelvic discomfort and swelling of the lower extremities, can be reduced. 
Another very interesting application of acupuncture and moxibustion is to 
convince a baby to turn head-down before delivery. This technique is very 
successful if applied before the 32nd week of pregnancy, and is much more 
comfortable for the mother than &quot;modern&quot; methods.</p> 
<p>After delivery, acupuncture is very helpful in addressing post partum 
depression and mood changes, nursing difficulties, and also assists in 
restoring a mother's body and function to non pregnant status. Chinese medicine 
understands that pregnancy, delivery and nursing create tremendous demands on a 
woman's physiology and reserve, and a variety of effective solutions are 
available to help restore stamina and assist the adjustments to motherhood.</p>

<h2>Migraine, Vascular, Cluster, and Tension Headache</h2> 
<p>Physicians tend to like to classify headaches in one of the above 
categories. In reality, patients suffer a variety of headaches, and are more 
accurately understood to have what I call a &quot;mixed headache 
disorder&quot;. Very few patients have one type of headache only, and one type 
of headache can &quot;trigger&quot; another type.</p> 
<p>For example, a facial headache which originates from the sinuses can 
trigger a vascular, &quot;migraine&quot; type headache. Tension type headaches, 
often found at the base of the skull, can also lead to a migraine. Some 
headaches are associated with changes in hormone levels, and are more 
accurately seen as complications of premenstrual or menopausal imbalances. For 
information on this, see the section onFertility and Gynecologic Problems.</p> 
<p>As with many other pain syndromes, headache can cause a variety of symptoms 
which are not in the head. Digestive disorders, fatigue, interruption of sleep 
and mood changes can also be addressed at the same time as treatment of the 
headache.</p> 
<p>Wholistic treatment with acupuncture avoids the common problem of many 
doctors treating different areas of the body with conflicting drugs. Drug 
therapy also creates the risk of developing &quot;rebound&quot; headaches which 
occur when the drugs wear off. These can be very difficult to treat, as the 
patient must be withdrawn from the headache drugs. As most physicians have 
nothing other than more drugs to offer, an endless cycle of complications is 
the result.</p> 
<p>Physicians with Oriental training can accurately localize the affected 
channels which lead to headache, and apply specific acupuncture to more 
effectively treat the problem. Associated symptoms will be included in the 
treatment, as correction of a channel disorder always affects other areas of 
the body as well as the emotional balance. With time, the headaches become less 
frequent and less severe, with the goal of eliminating them altogether.</p> 
<p>TOP</p> 
<h2>Sports and Work-related Injuries, Trauma</h2> 
<p>One of the areas in which acupuncture is most impressive is in the area of 
acute injury. Although this aspect of acupuncture is not well known to the 
public, I always advise a patient to try to have treatment within 48 hours of 
an injury. The results are often very satisfying to the patient in terms of 
pain relief, decrease of swelling, and rapid return to normal function.</p> 
<p>Once, during an early class for my elective on Japanese acupuncture, a 
student had, just before the class, injured herself playing volleyball, and her 
wrist was already swollen and discolored. The students had not seen acupuncture 
in the real world, so, with the student's permission, I demonstrated a 
treatment of the tendinomuscular meridian involved. The students could actually 
see the swelling decrease during the 20 minutes of the treatment and hear the 
patient's amazement at the pain relief and how much more flexibility she had.
</p> 
<p>All sorts of trauma, from bruises to sprains to strains to concussions and 
fractures, can be partially or completely treated with acupuncture and plant 
derived medicines. I have seen very good results for professional athletes, 
martial artists, performers, animal trainers and horsewomen. Even overuse 
injuries and weekend sports injuries respond well.</p> 
<p>It is unfortunate that more acupuncture is not provided to patients in 
emergency rooms, because there are significant advantages to quickly addressing 
pain and swelling without the possible side effects of drugs. Even if surgery 
is ultimately necessary, adept application of acupuncture will assist in the 
healing and rehabilitative phases.</p> 
<p>Trauma also inevitably involves emotional effects. Many injuries occur in 
situations of great tension, and the result is often fear, anxiety, worry and 
obsession. Chinese medical techniques are uniquely helpful for many of the 
emotional imbalances which are associated with traumatic experiences.</p> 
<p>TOP</p> 
<h2>Before and After Surgical Procedures</h2> 
<p>Elective or emergency surgery is also a situation where acupuncture can be 
very helpful. Surgery is really a type of trauma, but it is controlled by the 
surgeon to achieve a particular result. Nonetheless, there is still swelling, 
bruising and pain, and loss of function just as with accidental trauma. 
Sometimes there is post operative pain which does not improve as expected, and 
acupuncture can be used to try to reduce the painful sensations. In the lineage 
of Japanese acupuncture that I have studied, treatment is often applied to 
scars as they begin to heal. Acupuncture and plant medicines are also used for 
scars that remain painful, or are causing referred pain.</p> 
<p>Sometimes scar-related symptoms are not obvious. For example, I have seen 
chronic headaches cured by treatment of scars from plastic facial surgery. I 
remember the first case of this I saw: the patient had not listed her surgery 
on the history form that I use, and so I did not check the scars for tenderness 
as I usually do. I was puzzled as to why the headaches were not responding to 
my treatment, but once I noted the scars within the hairline, the picture 
became clear and the headaches responded to treatment.</p> 
<p>Post surgical pain is often frustrating for both surgeons and patients, and 
is generally poorly addressed by modern Western physicians. Before you start on 
pharmaceutical drugs or have nerve blocks or more surgery, consider Oriental 
medicine.</p> 
<p>TOP</p> 
<h2>Reduce the Discomforts and Side Effects of Chemotherapy and Surgery for 
Cancer</h2> 
<p>Patients undergoing chemotherapy or radiation therapy should consider 
acupuncture and traditional Chinese medicinals to reduce the nausea, fatigue 
and discomfort of treatment. A variety of studies have indicated the 
effectiveness of acupuncture for the nausea that may accompany various 
chemotherapy agents.</p> 
<p>I am seeing increasing numbers of people who suffer neuropathy and other 
neurologic problems as side effects of their treatment, and this can sometimes 
resolve very well with acupuncture and Chinese dietary therapy.</p> 
<p>The diagnosis of cancer causes a great deal of stress and can result in 
emotional imbalances and depression. In addition to the toxic effect on the 
heart of chemotherapy and radiation, fear can create both physical and 
emotional diorders of the heart. Japanese and Tibetan medical techniques are 
uniquely suited to addressing these sorts of problems.</p> 
<p>Overwhelming fatigue is also a problem which Chinese medicine can reduce, 
and it may be possible to decrease the negative effect of chemotherapy and 
radiation on normal tissues. Increases in red blood cells, white blood cells, 
and platelets with appropriate treatment is a realistic goal, as well as other 
improvements in blood chemistries which may be more subtle.</p> 
<p>Cancer surgery involves transecting the channels as well as issues unique 
to this type of procedure. Just as with other forms of surgery, acupuncture can 
be helpful in a variety of ways.</p> 
<p>It is unclear at this point how effective Oriental techniques are for 
increasing the effectiveness of Western anti-cancer therapies. Ongoing research 
in China and other countries is producing promising results in this area. What 
is already clear is that by overcoming the discomforts and emotional stress of 
treatment, a person's natural resources become more fully available.</p> 
<p>In a similar way, it is difficult to judge how beneficial Oriental medicine 
is for preventing recurrences and addressing the longer term consequence of 
chemotherapy and radiation causing secondary malignancy. However, I have seen 
very good results in motivated patients, and evidence is slowly accumulating in 
support of comprehensive integrated treatment.</p>

<h2>Acupuncture for Musculoskeletal Disorders: Arthritis, Tendonitis, and 
Fibromyalgia</h2> 
<p>The pain of chronic diseases such as arthritis, tendonitis, and 
fibromylagia can often be lessened by the use of acupuncture and other Oriental 
methods. Modern medications for these disorders commonly cause side effects 
that are not seen with acupuncture treatment. Symptoms associated with 
arthritis and fibromyalgia, such as problems sleeping, fatigue, and depression, 
can also respond to skillfully applied acupuncture.</p> 
<p>Muscular or joint symptoms which worsen &nbsp;with weather changes are also 
common. &nbsp;The use of moxibustion or dietary treatment can be very helpful 
for relief in this area. Exercise is also important to rehabilitate the joints 
and muscles, but it is necessary to relieve the pain &nbsp;to the degree 
necessary for the patient to begin an effective program of strengthening. The 
gentle movements of qi gong, tai qi, or yoga are an excellent foundation for 
more vigorous exercises with resistance bands or free weights.</p> 
<p>TOP</p> 
<h2>Acupuncture for Allergy, Asthma and Chronic Sinus Disease</h2> 
<p>Asthma is a syndrome of airway inflammation and constriction which affects 
the patient with cough, wheezing and shortness of breath. Both allergy and 
viral infections can trigger an asthmatic episode, as well as exposure to 
directly irritating substances such as smoke and cosmetic fragrances. Asthma 
and allergy symptoms are increasing in our society, and often require treatment 
with powerful drugs which cause a variety of side effects.</p> 
<p>Allergy to inhaled pollutants and pollen also contribute to asthmatic 
diseases. Most modern cities have problems with air quality outdoors, and 
indoor air is subject to pollution by furnishings, household chemicals, 
cosmetics and pet dander. Casual use of lawn chemicals that are functionally 
equivalent to combat nerve gases have also affected a number of my patients.</p>
<p>Symptoms of allergy and hypersensitivity may affect the body in the 
sinuses, the airways, the mucous membranes, the lungs or the skin. Some 
individuals develop problems in all of these areas. Sinus symptoms may include 
congestion, watery or sticky discharges, pain and pressure. Sinus inflammation 
can also trigger facial headaches as well as &quot;migraine&quot; type vascular 
headaches.</p> 
<p>The use of acupuncture and dietary therapy can be very helpful to reduce or 
eliminate the signs and symptoms of allergic and irritant asthma and sinus 
disease. Patients report that they can use fewer medications and feel better.

<h2>Acupuncture for Smoking Cessation</h2> 
<h3>(also applies to other forms of chronic tobacco use)</h3> 
<p>No one has an easy time altering psychological or physical habits. The 
addictive aspect of tobacco means that there is a variable withdrawal syndrome 
that people go through when they abruptly stop smoking. Acupuncture can reduce 
the discomfort of this phase considerably.</p> 
<p>A more difficult aspect of the habit of smoking is the habitual 
associations of your smoking with other activities, such as driving, drinking 
coffee, etc. Acupuncture will not help you to reduce these associations, though 
they will lose some of their power as long as you continue as a nonsmoker. We 
have specific suggestions in this area which we cover in the first acupuncture 
session.</p> 
<p> Most people are able to stop comfortably after one acupuncture session, 
although we recommend that you schedule another treatment should you find the 
craving for tobacco returning. If you do restart smoking, even if it is weeks 
or months later, we suggest that you schedule another treatment and again try 
to stop before the habit reestablishes itself. Ask for the brochure on how 
acupuncture can help you to stop smoking when you call our office.</p>
