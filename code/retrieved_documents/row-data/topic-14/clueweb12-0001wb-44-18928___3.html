<h4>Herbal Medicine Remedies</h4> Chinese herbs are safe and effective<br>
 
Sanjiu gives options to patients allowing them to choose between the 
traditional raw herbs to the modern high-tech products. The top quality raw 
herbs are imported direct from China. The herbal extracts come from Sanjiu 
China with GMP certification. <br>
<br>

<h4>Types of Herbal Medicine</h4> 1. Raw herbs<br>
 The conventional method of 
applying herb therapy is by decoction - a strong &quot;tea&quot; made by 
simmering raw herbs in water. Traditionally, a specially glazed clay teapot is 
used to make the tea. Click here to purchase online.<br>

<br>

<p>Sanjiu Medical Centre builds up the most complete and high performance 
stock of Chinese herbs. We have a collection of over 700 types of commonly used 
herbs of the top quality. Patients are able to purchase raw herbs from us 
online. We are pleased to ship the herbs to anywhere around the world.</p> 
<p>We offer the best quality, the best price, and the best service. Please 
click here to order raw herbs and other products online.</p> 2. Cooked herbal 
medicine (vacuum packed)<br>
 Herbal extracts may be the easiest way to prepare 
herbal medicine. However, some patients prefer the original flavor of the raw 
herbs. To serve our patients better, we installed a computerized automatic 
decoction machine that is able to cook the raw herbs automatically. Then the 
tea is automatically vacuum packed for immediate use.<br>
<br>
<br>

<p>&nbsp;</p> 3,. Herbal Extracts<br>
 Since the decoction method is time 
consuming, and the taste of the decoction is unpalatable to many, herbal 
extracts (concentrated Chinese herbal granules) are developed. Herbal extract 
is a representation of a new generation of Chinese herbal products, offering a 
safe and convenient way of using herbal medicine. These extracts carry the same 
potency. <br>
<br>

<p>Sanjiu Medical &amp; Wellness Centre is an industry leader in Canada that 
adopts the use of modernized herbal Chinese medicines in the form of instant 
herbal extracts which are manufactured by Sanjiu China, our parent company. 
Sanjiu China is the largest medical and pharmaceutical products producer in 
China. Click here for further information about the quality of Sanjiu's 
pharmaceutical products.</p> 
<p>Sanjiu's herbal extracts are designed for professional use by Chinese 
Medicine practitioners, and they are not available in retail stores. Sanjiu's 
herbal extracts are also being used in the Clinical Research &amp; Services 
Centres around the world.<br>
</p> 4. Pulverized herbs in capsules or pills<br>

 Another type of herbal medicine is made in the form of capsules and pills 
similar to Western Medicine.<br>
<br>
<br>

<p>Prepared and pulverized herbs are usually prepared according to classical 
Chinese herbal formula. It is the most convenient way to take herbal medicine. 
However, most of the Chinese Medicine doctors prescribe Chinese herbs to the 
patients according to the specific symptoms and conditions. In some situation, 
the effectiveness of the pulverized (patent) medicine is not as good as raw 
herbs and herbal extracts.</p> <br>
