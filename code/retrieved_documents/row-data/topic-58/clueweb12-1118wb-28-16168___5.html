<h2>[edit] Series 1 - 2004</h2> 
<h3>[edit] The Bart Book</h3> 
<p><b>The Bart Book</b> was released in the first series of the Library of 
Wisdom. The book was similar to the bookBart Simpson's Guide to Life, and the 
character biographies were also similar to the ones in the Complete Guide 
series.</p> 
<h3>[edit] The Homer Book</h3> 
<p><b>The Homer Book</b> was released in the first series of the Library of 
Wisdom. The book received better reviews than The Bart Book, due to the fact 
there has not formally been a Homer-devoted book.</p> 
<h2>[edit] Series 2 - 2005</h2> 
<p>From the second series, the books changed slightly. The books no longer 
contained character biographies, and instead contained more locations pages. 
The covers from each region had a lot of differences.</p> 
<h3>[edit] The Ralph Wiggum Book</h3> 
<p><b>The Ralph Wiggum Book</b> was released in the second series of the 
Library of Wisdom. This book features the &quot;wisdom&quot; of Ralph - namely 
poems from him (including &quot;The Other Little Ringworm&quot;), a story of 
&quot;Wigglepuppy&quot;, his imaginary canine friend and various quotes from 
him including: &quot;I eat corn!&quot; and &quot;Satan told me to tell you 
&quot;Hi&quot;&quot;.</p> 
<h3>[edit] Comic Book Guy's Book of Pop Culture</h3> 
<p><b>Comic Book Guy's Book of Pop Culture</b> was released in the second 
series of the Library of Wisdom. The book breaks a pattern in the title by not 
being called &quot;The Comic Book Guy Book&quot;. This book is mostly about 
Comic Book Guy's take onPopular culture, and little about the actual character 
himself.</p> 
<h2>[edit] Series 3 - 2006</h2> 
<p>These books were released on September 18, 2006. It was the third series 
and again, included two books. Fans were happier with these new books, as they 
focus on main characters, rather than secondary ones such as The Ralph Wiggum 
Book. These books got the character profiles back.</p> 
<h3>[edit] The Lisa Book</h3> 
<p><b>The Lisa Book</b> was released in the third series of the Library of 
Wisdom.</p> 
<h3>[edit] The Krusty Book</h3> 
<p><b>The Krusty Book</b> was released in the third series of the Library of 
Wisdom.</p> 
<h2>[edit] Series 4 - 2008</h2> 
<p>The two books for series 4 are similar to the series 3 books as they focus 
on main characters as well.</p> 
<h3>[edit] Flanders' Book of Faith</h3> 
<p>The book about Ned Flanders was released in the fourth series of the 
Library of Wisdom and contains a comic book of virtues, character profiles 
(God, Maude, Rod and Todd), Ask-Aroonie the Nedster! Ned Answers Kids' 
Questions About Religion and A Ned Flanders Cookbook.</p> 
<h3>[edit] The Book of Moe</h3> 
<p>The Book of Moe was released in the fourth series of the Library of Wisdom. 
It includes a lot of information about Moe's love life: (Perfect Dates, Perfect 
Moe-Ments), (20 Types of Dates) and (Moe's tried and almost successful pickup 
lines). It also doesn't contain any character profiles.</p> 
<h2>[edit] Series 5 - 2009/2010</h2> 
<h3>[edit] The Marge Book</h3> 
<h3>[edit] Chief Wiggum's Book of Crime and Punishment</h3> 
<p>The Chief Wiggum Book of Crime and Punishment is a book detailing Clancy 
Wiggum's career as a police officer in Springfield. It contains humorous 
anecdotes of fighting crime in Springfield, as well as insight into the police 
force's general laziness. There are also amusing laws from the United States 
and from around the world added to pages throughout the book.</p> view&nbsp;
