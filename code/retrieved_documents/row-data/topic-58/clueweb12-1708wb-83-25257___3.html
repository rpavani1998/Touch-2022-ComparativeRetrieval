<p>Bart Simpsons goes green in &ldquo;<strong>The Simpsons</strong>&rdquo; 
22nd annual installment of &ldquo;Treehouse of Horror&rdquo;. In a newly 
released sneak peek for the special Halloween episode, the eldest child of 
Homer and Marge is seen waking up as a single-eyed creature and boasting about 
facing his bullies with his new body.<br>
</p> 
<p><br>
</p> 
<p>The scene is included in a sketch titled &ldquo;In the Na&rsquo;Vi&rdquo;, 
which follows Bart and Milhouse as they are assigned on a mission to access a 
sacred extract on a distant planet. They morph into the land&rsquo;s indigenous 
one-eyed avatars, but when Bart finds love and an eternal mate abroad, he is

<h3>New &lsquo;The Simpsons&rsquo; Promo Celebrates Its Two-Season Renewal</h3>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Posted by:  | Comments Comments Off</p> 
<p>In the wake of its recent two-season renewal, &ldquo;<strong>The Simpsons
</strong>&rdquo; has released a promo which celebrates the good news. Calling 
the Simpson clan &ldquo;a family that doesn&rsquo;t know the meaning of the 
word &lsquo;canceled&rsquo;,&rdquo; the video that makes its way out via 
Entertainment Weekly features &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll Never Stop The 
Simpsons&rdquo; from season 13 with new lyrics boasting it has a lot of stories 
or two more years.<br>
</p> 
<p><br>
</p> 
<p>Earlier this month, there was a fear that &ldquo;The Simpsons&rdquo; would 
be canceled following a salary dispute between the main voice cast and 20th 
Century Fox Television, which produces the show. The problem was eventually 
solved a few days later and FOX announced that it has picked up the longest 
running primetime scripted series for a 24th and 25th season.<br>
<br>
The show 
is now gearing up to debut its 22nd annual installment of &ldquo;Treehouse of 
Horror&rdquo;. The special Halloween episode, in which one of the sketches 
spoofs &ldquo;<strong>Dexter</strong>&ldquo;, will air on Sunday, October 30 at 
8 P.M. ET on FOX.</p> Categories : Download The Simpsons Episodes, The Simpsons

<h3>The Simpsons : Homer-free fun for Marge and the kids!</h3> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Posted by:  | Comments Comments Off</p> 
<p>While writing blogs for <strong>Simpsons</strong>, I have often tried 
putting down the reasons that significantly contribute towards the success of 
this series.<br>
</p> 
<p><br>
</p> 
<p>I did come up with quite a few reasons and tried narrowing down to the most 
important one. According to me, Simpsons has maintained its family-centric plot 
for over 23 seasons, and the script has been developed in a manner to give 
equal importance to each family member.<br>
</p> 
<p>Like the previous episode dealt completely with Bart&rsquo;s newfound 
interest in his history books. It focused completely on incidents that for the 
first time inculcated Bart&rsquo;s interest in the subject of history.<br>
</p> 
<p>He also realized the importance of a good teacher, as he dared to take the 
entire school as hostage in return for the reinstatement of Chalmers as a 
member of the school&rsquo;s faculty.<br>
</p> 
<p>So, that was Bart&rsquo;s tryst with the meaning and purpose of academics; 
the upcoming episode completely shifts focus to his mother, Mrs. Marge 
Simpsons. Marge is tired with handling the mundane household chores on a daily 
basis and expresses that she is jealous of her husband for not leaving any 
opportunity for her to have fun with the children.<br>
</p> 
<p>In <strong>Simpsons season 23 episode 3</strong>, Marge is angry over the 
fact that Homer is the one always enjoying with the kids while the household 
chores keep her busy.<br>
</p> 
<p>Marge and the kids happen to get an opportunity to feast on some Ethiopian 
delicacies, after which they decide to express their satisfaction derived from 
the food (and the specialty of the cuisine) through a food blog. And so they 
start one.<br>
</p> 
<p>Well, get ready to watch Marge having all the fun with the children this 
time, with Homer experiencing a feeling of boycott (left out)!<br>

<h3>&lsquo;The Simpsons&rsquo; Cast Strikes Deal for Two More Seasons</h3> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Posted by:  | Comments Comments Off</p> 
<p>&ldquo;<strong>The Simpsons</strong>&rdquo; is yet to die. Following a 
salary dispute between the main cast and 20th Century Fox Television which 
produces the show, it has just been officially announced on Friday noon, 
October 7 that the longest running primetime scripted show on the air will stay 
for two more seasons.<br>
</p> 
<p><br>
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;FOX has renewed THE SIMPSONS, the longest-running comedy in 
television history, for an incredible 24th and 25th season, bringing the series 
total to an astonishing 559 episodes,&rdquo; the network which airs the 
animated series says in a statement. &ldquo;In the words of Homer Simpson, 
&lsquo;Woo Hoo! I outlasted Andy Rooney!&rsquo; &rdquo;<br>
<br>
Details of the 
new two-year contract are not disclosed. Earlier the same day, before the deal 
was sealed, it was reported that the main voice cast agreed to take a pay cut 
but not as big as the 45% reduction that the studio demanded. Voice actor Harry 
Shearer, meanwhile, offered that he was willing to accept a 70% pay cut in 
return for back-end payments.</p> Categories : Download The Simpsons Episodes,

<h3>The Simpsons Season 23 Episode 2 &ldquo;Bart Stops to smell the 
Roosevelts&rdquo; Recap</h3> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Posted by:  | Comments Comments Off</p> 
<p>Its been a week that <strong>The Simpsons episodes</strong> have returned 
for making us entertain and laugh. So enjoying every bit of it we have here 
recap of this week&rsquo;s episode which was titled &ldquo;Bart stops to smell 
the Roosevelts&rdquo;.<br>
</p> 
<p><br>
</p> 
<p>Bart has always been mischievous and this time his mischief has cost his 
school heavily destroying its fundraiser. So in order to set Bart right we see 
in<strong>The Simpsons Season 23 Episode 2</strong> the Principal has got 
Superintendent Gary Calmers on work.<br>
</p> 
<p>Calmers accepts this challenge and makes an attempt to change Bart in a 
different way and while he is doing this Bart and his band &ldquo;Rough 
Riders&rdquo; are taken on camping in Springefield forest. And they are taught 
American history about President Theodore Roosevelt in a different manner which 
makes it more interesting. In fact we see in<strong>The Simpsons Season 23 
episode 2</strong> that Calmers trick works and he is able to create a great 
impact on Bart with his teachings.<br>
</p> 
<p>But unfortunately Calmers is removed from his position due to a minor 
accident that takes place while camping. Later we see in<strong>episode 2 of 
The Simpsons Season 23</strong>that Bart and his friends stand for the teacher 
who changed them a bit (though not much as how can Bart be changed so easily, 
we also love Bart as he is). He holds the school as hostage until the 
administration takes Calmers back in school.<br>

<p>Those waiting for the laughs and fun can take a sign of relief as their 
<strong>The Simpsons episodes</strong> are back with a new season. The <strong>

</p> 
<p><br>
</p>

Keifer Sutherland as Wayne. The episode began with entrance of Wayne as the new 
security guard in the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant and Homer trying again 
and again to be friends with him. But Wayne is not ready for the friendship and 
the reason is later revealed.<br>
</p> 
<p>We had daydreaming part of Marge that she has become winner in Master Chef 
series and action sequence in this<strong>The Simpsons Season 23 Premiere 
episode</strong>. The action scene was that when Wayne and Homer go to 
Moe&rsquo;s Tavern for a drink Snake appears for robbery but gets a good thrash 
from Wayne. Then only we come to know that Wayne was actually a highly trained 
government agent and that&rsquo;s why he is not so friendly. And this nature of 
his costs him his job also.<br>
</p> 
<p>Later in <strong>Premiere Episode of The Simpsons Season 23</strong> we see 
that Homer shows his true friendship by giving Wayne a shelter but landing up 
into trouble due to this. But Wayne is also not less in keeping his friendship 
and save Homer from former&rsquo;s gangster enemies. So we got bite of action 
along with laughter.<br>
