<h2>Ratings: The Devil Wears Nada</h2> 
<p>Last night&rsquo;s episode &lsquo;The Devil Wears Nada&rsquo; had a total of
<strong>9.04 million</strong> viewers. This makes the episode the second 
highest rated this season, behind &lsquo;Bart Gets a &lsquo;Z&rsquo; which had 
9.32 million viewers last month. The Cleveland Show followed with 7.01 million 
viewers, while a usually-dominant Family Guy had 8.28 million viewers at 9:00 
(yes, it was a new episode too). The Simpsons figures were helped by the 
overrun of the preceding Football match but kept it on top for the night. 
American Dad had 5.99 million viewers at 9.30pm.</p> 
<p>Fox was third overall for the night and second among the 18 &ndash; 49 
demographic. NBC was the winner in both categories.</p>

<p>Pretty good episode. I&rsquo;m happy to hear that it beat FG.</p> 
<p>&mdash;Favorite joke&mdash;<br>
 Homer: See? Carl hasn&rsquo;t changed that 
much.<br>
 Carl: Yes I have. In ways you&rsquo;re just beginning to realise.</p>

<p>Hands up who thinks it was high just because of the opportunity to see 
Marge as a Calendar Girl?</p> 
<p>Just me I suspect  Awesome ratings, sound stuff. An odd little hike back up 
the ratings scales isn&rsquo;t it? Impressed, thought it was going to be simply 
downhill for a little while.</p> Reply <br>

<p>Brilliant lets keep it over 9 mil get it back to 10 mil and we will finally 
see Simpsons beating Family guy again&hellip;.</p> 
<p>It was a great episode too, though Carl was too harsh to Homer &ndash; 
reminds me of how harsh Paul is to Barry in Chucklevision</p> Reply <br>

Homer. hope they&rsquo;ll stay above family guy </p> Reply <br>

<p>Brilliant news! AWESOME SHOW! very funny episode</p> 
<p>Hopefully now FOX will keep going with the Simpsons! Really happy that F.G 
lost to simpsons much better ratings that last season</p> 
<p>Great site!</p> Reply <br>

<p>Yeah! <br>
 Finally Simpsons are back in the saddle again! I&rsquo;m very 
happy with this numbers, and I&rsquo;m so glad that Simpsons finally got higher 
rates that the Family Guy!!!</p> 
<p>I hope that rates are not this high just because Simpsons made a little 
two-week break. This was fresh episode after almost half a month&hellip;</p> 
<p>Anyway, we will see if this high rate trend will continue in the next few 
episodes, my highest hopes&hellip;</p> Reply <br>

<p>Good episode. Why is it important for the Simpsons to beat Family Guy? 
Everyone acts like it is a damn football game on here. I say we be glad both 
shows are doing great so they will be on for years to come.</p> Reply <br>

<p>@Pleco- First what You need to know is that between Simpsons and Family Guy 
have been a great competition since the Family Guy started as a show on FOX.</p>
<p>Reason for that is surely cause F.G. made Simpsons ratings much lower, they 
literally took over over 1/4 (or even more) of old viewers from the Simpsons.
</p> 
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that F.G. is bad show (although I don&rsquo;t like kind 
of art, or the way gags are presented in show), but I surely like Simpsons 
much, much more, and I can say that I&rsquo;m really proud on the Simpsons when 
I see that their ratings are better than Family Guys.</p> 
<p>And just to note, I wish all the luck to Family Guy, but as long as they 
are direct competition to the Simpsons, I can&rsquo;t say that I would like to 
see them in the air instead of Simpsons&hellip;</p> Reply <br>

<p>@Pleco &ndash; Just like Lisa said in 1F18, &ldquo;Everybody needs a 
nemesis. Sherlock Holmes had his Dr. Moriarty, Mountain Dew has its Mellow 
Yellow, even Maggie has that baby with the one eyebrow.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>And The Simpsons has Family Guy. But it&rsquo;s a friendly competition 
I&rsquo;d hope </p> Reply <br>

<p>I finally saw this episode today, and it&rsquo;s really no wonder why it 
had so many viewer- It&rsquo;s surely one of the best (if not the best) episode 
in new season. I hope that next episode will be as good as this one- It will 
make good impression on viewers to see few good episodes consecutively week by 
week. It will stabilize ratings, and hopefully will make real break through 
after few not-so-great seasons, just what this show needs!</p> Reply <br>
