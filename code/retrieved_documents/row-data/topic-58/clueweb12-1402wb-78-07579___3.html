<h2>Ratings: The Great Wife Hope</h2> 
<p>7.55 million viewers tuned into &ldquo;The Great Wife Hope&rdquo; last 
night, meaning the third episode of the new season is now the least watched. 
While every show in Fox&rsquo;s Animation Domination ensemble saw notable 
reductions in viewer numbers, both a new episode of Family Guy and it&rsquo;s 
new spin-off series The Cleveland Show managed to edge The Simpsons out of the 
top spot for the third week running, with 8.8 and 7.78 million viewers tuning 
in respectively. American Dad once again finished in fourth place on the night, 
with a mediocre 6.7 million watching.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>As usual, NBC won the night with it&rsquo;s Sunday Night Football; Fox was 
fourth overall on the night, coming second in the aged 18-34 category.</p>

<p>I thought this was a really good episode of The Simpsons. -sigh- I&rsquo;ll 
always be bummed when Family Guy gets a higher rating, but it&rsquo;s really 
sad when The Cleveland Show beats it.</p> 
<p>I even tried to watch The Cleveland show and I had to turn it off after the 
first 10 min. Nothing from it was making me laugh. Cleveland is a funny 
character, but I think he was funnier as a member of Peter&rsquo;s gang.</p>

<p>Cleveland Show was by far the funniest of the night. The Simpsons episode 
was good too. I thought this episode was the best one so far but that 
doesn&rsquo;t say much since there have only been three episodes and the other 
two were crap. Family Guy was just terrible. Also on the subject of NBC 
football, go Colts!!!!!</p> 
<p>Can&rsquo;t wait for the THOH this week!</p> Reply <br>

<p>Hey, what gives? The ratings for Bart Gets a Z say it got over a million 
viewers more than Cleveland last week, yet here it says Cleveland beat The 
Simpsons &ldquo;for the third week running.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Anyway, I was surprised by how good this episode was, especially 
considering the premise, which seemed rather silly on paper but worked 
surprisingly well in practice.</p> 
<p>Cleveland, meanwhile, disappointed me. After the first two eps I thought it 
was going to distinguish itself by having a little more heart than Family Guy 
or American Dad, but it looks like it&rsquo;s on track to be a cheap copy of 
FG. Cleveland is already becoming stupider at an amazing speed; at this rate 
he&rsquo;ll be a clone of Peter by mid-season.</p> Reply <br>

<p>I meant it was edged off the top spot for the third week running. Which it 
was.</p> Reply <br>

<p>This episode was the worst one this season so far, but still very good.</p>

<p>Some very mixed up season ratings. But the always good optimism is that 
they are all much higher than last year.</p> 
<p>I do reckon 9million is a limit for this type of genre these days in the 
US. And The Simpsons need to hover around there to keep themselves in the game 
so to speak</p> Reply <br>

<p>Honestly I thought that this episode will bring us even bigger numbers than 
last week, but again we got a surprise (this time not so nice).</p> 
<p>I hope that THOH won&rsquo;t disappoint us, big numbers are expected and 
very much needed&hellip;</p> Reply <br>

<p>This episode was awesome way better than family guy, american dad an the 
cleveland show, this three look all the same&hellip;<br>
 I really don&rsquo;t 
know why were the ratings that low, this three episodes of the 21st season were 
all great!<br>
 and I&rsquo;m really hoping that the halloween episode will be 
the best THOH so far</p> Reply <br>

<p>This episode was by far the worst episode ever!<br>
 I&rsquo;m not 
surprised it got low ratings. The other two were way better!!</p> 
<p>However i know the new THOH will be a lot better though.</p> Reply <br>

<p>Marbat, your ratings are useless. They&rsquo;re all opinion, and clearly, 
you are a bigger Simpsons fan than any of the other shows. Is there any point, 
you will always give the Simpson&rsquo;s high ratings anyway.</p> Reply <br>

<p>I thought this episode was actually great. I laughed out loud which I 
rarely do lately! Even my husband ran in to watch it and he usually 
doesn&rsquo;t care too much about Simpsons. Anyways, the season honestly has 
been off to a great start I think. Also, I record The Simpsons, I don&rsquo;t 
watch it when it airs.</p> Reply <br>

<p>the Clevland show is worse then the simpsons but this episode was slightly 
better<br>
 Family guy was the 3rd with american dad 4th.<br>
 I bet the only 
reason clevland show gets more episodes is because of it being a spin-off 
that&rsquo;s my opinion<br>
 The only reason I watch it is because I always 
watch Animation Domination</p> Reply <br>

<p>The best animation domination was when it used to be on tuesdays, aka 
&ldquo;DA BOOM!&rdquo; It had Futurama, The PJ&rsquo;s, I think a Simpsons 
repeat and I&rsquo;m not sure if the 4th show was Family Guy or King of The 
Hill.</p> 
<p>I still miss King of The Hill. </p> Reply <br>

<p>i&rsquo;am a fan of all the animation domination shows not just the 
simpsons and i&rsquo;m not bias. Everyone has the right to a opinion.</p> Reply

<p>Marbat has right to put his opinion here no matter is he bigger fan of the 
Simpsons or some other show, and I see no reason why would it bother 
someone&hellip;</p> Reply <br>

<p>I saw this episode last night, and honestly, in comparing with other two 
episodes we&rsquo;ve seen this new season, it&rsquo;s the worst one&hellip;</p> 
<p>Maybe the best part of the episode was when Marge was preparing her self 
for combat (especially part with mr. Burns), but Ultimate fight at the end was 
a bit disappointing, since I expected one big crowd fight&hellip; </p> Reply
