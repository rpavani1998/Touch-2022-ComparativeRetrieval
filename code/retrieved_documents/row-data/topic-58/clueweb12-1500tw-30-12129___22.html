ever wondered where Springfield, the home of Homer, Marge, Maggie, Lisa and 
Bart Simpson, is really based? Photograph: AP<br>

<p>The tales of Homer Simpson and his family have become embedded in 
television lore, but have you ever wondered where Springfield, the illustrious 
hometown ofThe Simpsons, is really based?</p> 
<p>The town of Springfield has become a character of its own on the popular 
animated TV show, serving as the backdrop to the adventures of the Simpson 
family. But in 23 years on air, the show's creator has kept the real location 
of the town veiled, saying he didn't want to &quot;ruin it for people&quot; 
&ndash; until now.</p> 
<p>In an interview with Smithsonian Magazine's May issue, Matt Groening 
revealed that the animated town is based on Springfield, Oregon, near his 
childhood hometown of Portland.</p> 
<p>He also said he was inspired to use the town's name after it was featured 
on the 1950s television show Father Knows Best.</p> 
<p>&quot;I also figured out that Springfield was one of the most common names 
for a city in the US In anticipation of the success of the show, I thought, 
'This will be cool; everyone will think it's their Springfield.' And they 
do,&quot; said the show's creator.</p> 
<p>The tales of doughnut-loving father Homer J. Simpson and his dysfunctional 
family, wife Marge and kids Bart, Lisa and Maggie, have become a staple of 
American culture, winning 27 Emmy awards, earning a star on Hollywood's Walk of 
Fame, and even coining a new word as Homer's expression &quot;D'oh!&quot; 
entered the Oxford English Dictionary in 2011.</p> 
<p>The Simpson family are named after Groening's family &ndash; father Homer 
(named after the Greek poet Homer), mother Margaret and sisters Lisa and Maggie.
</p> 
<p>Bart is based on the creator himself, although Groening changed the name 
from 'Matt' to 'Bart' because he &quot;had this idea of an angry father yelling 
'Bart,' and Bart sounds kind of like bark-like a barking dog,&quot; and he 
thought it would sound funny.</p> 
<p>The inspirations drawn from Oregon didn't just stop at the town name. 
Groening also said he named some of the characters after streets in Portland, 
including Reverend Lovejoy, the school bully Kearney and the Simpsons' 
annoyingly lovable neighbour Ned Flanders.</p> 
<p>Even the address that America's favourite animated family live at, 632 
Evergreen Terrace, is named after Groening's own childhood home address.</p> 
<p>The Simpsons was created by Groening for Fox television and first aired in 
1989. It is the longest-running American sitcom in history, broadcast in more 
than 100 countries and 50 languages, and it still attracts an average 7.7 
million US viewers weekly.</p>

<p>It's pretty obvious given Groening's birthplace, but the point is that it 
IS &quot;everyone's Springfield&quot;. or, at least, it was. Now it's 
definitely in Oregon.</p> </li>

<p>Leaving out the link to Groening, the fact that The Simpsons is near the 
coast, mountains and has forests implies it's somewhere in the Pacific 
Northwest. The fact we discussed this at work the other day and I said as much 
only sweetens the deal and possibly means that I've won a Cadbury's Cream Egg 
out of it...</p> </li>

<p>Why did he do this? It was quite obvious, yes, but as he said 
&quot;everyone will think it's their Springfield.' And they do,&quot;<br>
Well 
they don't now do they! You killed that bit of civic pride and cultural 
curiosity for nothing but a touch of smugness Mr Groening.</p> </li>

<p>Matt Groening is clearly wrong. In the state of Kentucky, there is a town 
called Simpsonville, with another town lying adjacent called Shelbyville. This 
was the inspiration for the hometown of 'Sanctimonious' Marge Simpson and her 
nuclear family, and that is a scientifically proven fact.</p> </li>

<p>Oh how I love the smell of negative Guardian comment vitriol in the 
morning., Who cares. The Simpsons is still very very funny though not quite as 
cutting edge as it once was, before South Park and Family Guy etc.</p> 
<p>I have met the man Groening and he is very funny and very nice. All the 
generations of my family, from 10 to 80 love the show.</p> 
<p>Who cares if he admits something we already know about where it's set and 
who influenced the characters. Get a grip people.</p>

</i></p> 
<p>Charming bit of prose there. What always intrigues me though is when 
someone like yourself feigns indifference to an article/topic, then generalises 
that nobody else cares about said article/topic, but was obviously drawn enough 
to the article to first read and then comment on it. Lovely stuff.</p> </li>

<p>This is news? Groening is a native Oregonian! </p> 
<p>I lived in Oregon for many years, and it was widely known that Matt 
Groening borrowed a bunch of place names from Oregon in general and Portland in 
particular, and used them in the show. Even if it was never explicitly 
acknowledged, it was certainly assumed by Oregonians that Springfield, Oregon 
inspired the fictional Springfield. It is also old news that the 'generic' 
quality of Springfield played into his choice--he wanted an Anytown, USA 
quality, and 'Springfield' is indeed a banal and widely used name.</p> 
<p>The real Springfield is a lumber town, and has a blue collar quality, which 
puts it in contrast with nearby Eugene, which is home to the University of 
Oregon, and is exceptionally liberal politically and socially. Ken Kesey lived 
near Eugene, and the area is still teeming with hippies and potheads, both 
young and old.</p> </li>

<p>this whole comments board is a string of hens hanging off a balloon made 
from a single seed that lost its taste decades ago.</p> 
<p>Also, fowl as I am, wasn't there a competition about 10 years ago for all 
the Springfields to compete to be the Golden Groening Yellow?</p> </li>

<p>so what, its still shit. I doubt people really care anymore. I wish the 
Simpsons would piss off back to the 90's, when it was still funny and relevant.
</p> 
<p>Charming bit of prose there. What always intrigues me though is when 
someone like yourself feigns indifference to an article/topic, then generalises 
that nobody else cares about said article/topic, but was obviously drawn enough 
to the article to first read and then comment on it. Lovely stuff.<br>
 
--------------------</p> 
<p>I wish it stayed in the 90's only because I love seasons 2-8 so much and it 
upsets me to see the greatest tv show ever made become a caricature of itself

<p>I lived in Portland for a couple of years, wonderful weird city, the 
character names mentioned come from the trendy 'Alphabet District' where the 
streets are names in alphabetical order, so Lovejoy to Kearney is a short walk, 
and a few blocks to Flanders... never did find Nahasapeemapetilon st. tho. 
Oregon is fabulous, and if your looking for an alternative to the usual US 
vacation sites I hugely recommend a trip up the Oregon/Washington coastline... 
especially if you like cheese, otters and volcanoes..</p> </li>

<p>That would explain the mountains in the background, the woods and near the 
sea. I know that people still bang on how the Simpsons was funnier in the 90's 
but they still make good episodes. I do have one beef though; Channel 4
