<h1>The Gospel According to Homer</h1> <i>By Mark I. Pinsky</i>
<p>  &copy; <b>The Orlando Sentinel</b>, August 15, 1999. </p> <i>
&quot;Whether or not the soul is real, Bart, it's the symbol of everything that 
is fine inside us.&quot;</i><br>
 -- Lisa Simpson, age 8 
<p> When the animated television series <i>The Simpsons</i> appeared more than 
a decade ago, it was denounced by many throughout the nation -- and nowhere 
more vigorously than from America's pulpits. The nation's moral leaders 
thundered that this nuclear but dysfunctional family was the latest evidence of 
the fall of Western civilization.</p>
<p> &quot;We need a nation closer to the Waltons than the Simpsons,&quot; 
President<b>George Bush</b> told the National Religious Broadcasters in 1992. 
</p>
<p> As cartoonist <b>Matt Groening</b>'s show approaches a new season, it 
continues to be a source of controversy, this time drawing criticism from a 
Roman Catholic watchdog organization. The group, the Catholic League for 
Religious and Civil Rights, cited several jokes about the church. In one case, 
pressure from network officials this past season forced the show's producers to 
alter a line about the Catholic church from the original show when the program 
aired in rerun this summer.</p>
<p> But both the initial denunciations and the recent controversy obscure the 
fact that God, Christianity and Christians are more a part of the Simpsons' 
daily lives than any other prime-time network series, at least shows not 
specifically devoted to religion, such as<i>Touched By An Angel</i> and <i>
Seventh Heaven</i>. </p>
<p> &quot;Right-wingers complain there's no God on TV,&quot; Groening said in 
a recent interview in<i>Mother Jones</i> magazine. &quot;Not only do the 
Simpsons go to church every Sunday and pray, they actually speak to God from 
time to time. We show Him, and God has five fingers -- unlike the Simpsons, who 
only have four.&quot;</p>
<p> <b>Mike Scully</b>, the series' executive producer, said the show tries to 
reflect through its characters the fact that faith plays a substantial part in 
many families' lives, although it is seldom portrayed on television.</p>
<p> &quot;We try to represent people's honest attitudes about religion,&quot; 
he said.</p>
<p> <i>The Simpsons</i> is consistently irreverent toward organized religion's 
failings and excesses -- as it is with most other aspects of modern life. 
However, God is not mocked. When<i>The Simpsons</i> characters are faced with 
crises, they turn to God. He answers their prayers and intervenes in their 
world. The family says prayers before meals, believes in a literal heaven and 
hell, and ridicules cults. Their next-door neighbors are committed evangelical 
Christians.</p>
<p> Some in the religious world have recognized this phenomenon. Three years 
into the series, in 1992, the show was the subject of a favorable master's 
thesis at Pat Robertson's Regent University. &quot;While it may not completely 
resonate with the evangelical Judeo-Christian belief system,&quot; wrote Beth 
Keller, &quot;<i>The Simpsons</i> does portray a family searching for moral and 
theological ideals.&quot;</p>
<p> <i>The Door</i>, a religious humor magazine, put the series on a recent 
cover, with an article titled &quot;The Springfield Blessing: The Theology of 
Homer Simpson.&quot; And in the Christian monthly<i>PRISM</i>, published by 
Evangelicals for Social Action, teacher<b>Bill Dark</b> wrote that the series 
is &quot;the most pro-family, God-preoccupied, home-based program on 
television. Statistically speaking, there is more prayer on<i>The Simpsons </i>
than on any sitcom in broadcast history.&quot;</p>
<p> <b>William Romanowski</b> is looking for a video of &quot;Homer the 
Heretic,&quot; an episode of the Simpsons, to use in the class he teaches at 
Calvin College, a Christian school in Grand Rapids, Mich.</p>
<p> The author of <i>Pop Culture Wars: Religion and the Role of Entertainment 
in American Life</i>, Romanowski said the episode is instructive because 
&quot;it tries to get at the role God and religion play in people's everyday 
lives.&quot;</p>
<p> This is not to say that when the Old Testament prophet Isaiah said &quot;a 
little child shall lead them,&quot; he had young Bart Simpson in mind. 
Sometimes, it's more a case of &quot;suffer the little children.&quot; Bart's 
grace at mealtime is likely to be, &quot;Rub a dub, dub, thanks for the 
grub.&quot;</p>
<p> Homer, who works at a nuclear-power plant, often expresses gratitude at 
the dinner table, even extending well beyond sustenance, thanking God 
&quot;most of all for nuclear power, which is yet to cause a single, proven 
fatality, at least in this country.&quot;</p>
<p> The Simpson's blessings are decidedly mixed. After a particularly 
disastrous Thanksgiving Day, Homer loses it as he offers thanks &quot;for the 
occasional moments of peace and love our family's experienced . . . well, not 
today. You saw what happened. Oh Lord, be honest. Are we the most pathetic 
family in the world, or what?&quot;</p>
<p> As in many households, prayer at the Simpsons is most fervent in the face 
of disaster, like a hurricane or a comet bearing down on their cartoon town of 
Springfield, and often comes in the form of a bargain:</p>
<p> &quot;Dear God, this is Marge Simpson. If you stop this hurricane and save 
our family, we will be forever grateful and recommend you to all of our 
friends.&quot;</p>
<p> Or a nuclear meltdown, begun at Homer's workplace. </p>
<p> &quot;Dear Lord,&quot; Marge prays, &quot;if you spare this town from 
becoming a smoking hole in the ground, I'll try to be a better Christian. I 
don't know what I can do. Ummm . . . oh, the next time there's a canned-food 
drive, I'll give the poor something they actually like, instead of old lima 
beans and pumpkin mix.&quot;</p>
<p> Not all the crises that call for prayer are cosmic events. In &quot;Bart 
Gets an F,&quot; the boy is threatened with repeating a grade if he fails a 
test for which he is not prepared. Desperate, Bart asks God for one more day to 
study.</p>
<p> &quot;Prayer, the last refuge of the scoundrel,&quot; Lisa scoffs as she 
overhears her older brother. Nonetheless, a freak snow storm closes school the 
next day, saving him.</p>
<p> &quot;I heard you last night, Bart,&quot; Lisa tells him. &quot;You prayed 
for this. Now your prayers have been answered. I'm no theologian. I don't know 
who or what God is exactly. All I know is: He's a force more powerful than Mom 
and Dad put together, and you owe him big.&quot;</p>
<p> Bart acknowledges, &quot;Part of this D-minus belongs to God.&quot; </p>
<p> The Simpsons attend Springfield Community Church, with the unctuous Rev. 
Timothy Lovejoy in the pulpit, and a marquee featuring a variety of challenging 
messages, such as &quot;God, the Original Love Connection,&quot; and 
&quot;Sunday, the Miracle of Shame.&quot; The denomination is not specified, 
and Homer's understanding of theology is undeniably hazy.</p>
<p> Asked by Bart what his religious beliefs are, Homer answers, &quot;You 
know, the one with all the well-meaning rules that don't work in real life. Uh, 
Christianity.&quot;</p>
<p> But Homer does not doubt the existence of God, even when he decides not to 
go to church. Instead, he wants to start his own sybaritic religion, which 
occasions a divine visitation.</p>
<p> &quot;I'm not a bad guy,&quot; he tells God, who wears a robe and sandals, 
but whose visage is unseen. &quot;I work hard and I love my kids. So why should 
I spend half my Sunday hearing about how I'm going to hell?&quot;</p>
<p> God replies: &quot;Hmm, you've got a point there. You know, sometimes even 
I'd rather be watching football.&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;So I figure I should try to live right and worship you in my own 
way,&quot; Homer concludes. But he changes his mind about church and religion a 
few minutes later when he is dragged from his burning house by Ned Flanders, an 
evangelical Christian who lives next door.</p>
<p> Ned is a doofus -- there is no other word for him. He is such a 
goody-goody that he doesn't let his equally devout children use dice when 
playing board games because the playing pieces are &quot;wicked.&quot; Still, 
Ned takes his faith seriously, is righteous but not self-righteous, and is not 
a hypocrite. He is fired from Springfield Elementary School, where he is 
filling in as principal, for saying &quot;Let's thank the Lord&quot; over the 
intercom.</p>
<p> Abused constantly by his oafish next-door neighbor, the relentlessly 
upbeat Ned returns only love and good works. When Flanders suffers a breakdown 
and is condemned by the church, Homer tells members of the congregation, 
&quot;This man has turned every cheek on his body. If everyone here were like 
Ned Flanders, there'd be no need for heaven: We'd already be there.&quot;</p>
<p> The Flanders family is portrayed &quot;fallibly but sympathetically,&quot; 
said<b>Michael Glodo</b>, professor of Old Testament and Preaching at Reformed 
Theological Seminary in Oviedo. &quot;They are simple, sincere, earnest -- a 
good package of virtue, especially in a post-modern culture where cynicism and 
irony and satire are the prevailing sentiments.&quot;</p>
<p> Sometimes, Flanders' zeal goes too far. Given temporary custody of the 
Simpson children because of their parents apparent neglect, Ned attempts to 
baptize the children in the Springfield River, only to be interrupted in the 
midst of the rite by Homer.</p>
<p> &quot;Wow, Dad, you took a baptism for me,&quot; says a startled Bart. 
&quot;How do you feel?&quot;</p>
<p> Homer -- temporarily aglow -- replies, &quot;Oh, Bartholomew. I feel like 
St. Augustine of Hippo after his conversion by Ambrose of Milan.&quot;</p>
<p> Ned is flabbergasted by this. &quot;Homer, what did you say?&quot; </p>
<p> As the glow subsides, Homer returns to his natural state: &quot;I said, 
shut your ugly face, Flanders!&quot;</p>
<p> Yet even Flanders questions his faith when his home and his business are 
singled out for destruction by a hurricane, comparing himself to Job:</p>
<p> &quot;Why me, Lord? Where have I gone wrong? I've always been nice to 
people! I don't drink or dance or swear! I've even kept kosher just to be on 
the safe side! I've done everything the Bible says; even the stuff that 
contradicts the other stuff! What more could I do?&quot;</p>
<p> Moral dilemmas frequently confront characters, everything from stealing -- 
cookies from a jar or an illegal cable TV hookup -- to adultery, or selling 
your soul to the devil, which Homer does for a donut and Bart does for a 
Formula One race car and for $5 in cash.</p>
<p> &quot;What I do appreciate about <i>The Simpsons</i> is that evil often -- 
if not always -- is punished with consequences,&quot; said<b>Robert Knight</b>, 
director of cultural studies for the conservative, Washington, D.C.-based 
Family Research Council.</p>
<p> &quot;The Simpsons do function in a moral universe, and, while the show 
seems to make fun of moral standards, it often upholds those same standards in 
a back-handed way,&quot; said Knight, author of<i>The Age of Consent: The Rise 
of Relativism and The Corruption of Popular</i><i>Culture.</i> </p>
<p> When Otto, the stoned school-bus driver, becomes homeless he is invited by 
Bart to move into the Simpsons' garage.</p>
<p> &quot;I know we didn't ask for this, Homer,&quot; says Marge, &quot;but 
doesn't the Bible say, 'Whatsoever you do to the least of my brothers, that you 
do unto me . . . ?' &quot;</p>
<p> Yes, Homer replies, &quot;but doesn't the Bible also say, 'Thou shalt not 
take moochers into thy hut?' &quot;</p>
<p> The Simpsons, with its numerous catch phrases (&quot;D'oh!&quot; 
&quot;Don't have a cow, man&quot; &quot;Eat my shorts&quot; &quot;Underachiever 
and proud of it&quot; &quot;Ay, caramba!&quot;) has had an undeniable impact on 
American culture. It has been a healthy and sustained ratings performer for the 
Fox Network. And, if anything, time has enhanced the show's quality -- at least 
among critics.</p>
<p> &quot;Weirdly, remarkably, the show just kept getting better,&quot; <b>
Jeff MacGregor</b> wrote recently in the <i>New York Times.</i> </p>
<p> &quot;Since the passing of Seinfeld last year, <i>The Simpsons </i>is left 
alone as the only laugh-out-loud show on television,&quot; he said. &quot;It is 
the antidote to what ails most of the medium, at once smart and anarchic, 
subtle and raucous. After more than a decade, it remains colorful proof that 
'excellence' and 'television' needn't be concepts of mutual exclusion.&quot;</p>
<p> Conservative cultural critic <b>Michael Medved</b> agrees. </p>
<p> &quot;It's generally been acknowledged that <i>The Simpsons </i>is one of 
the most serious and seriously ambitious shows on television,&quot; he said.</p>
<p> No one would mistake Homer Simpson and his family for saints. In many 
ways, in fact, they are quintessentially weak, good-hearted sinners who rely on 
their faith -- but only when absolutely necessary.</p>
<p> &quot;They have captured a very common understanding of who God is,&quot; 
said Glodo, of Reformed Theological Seminary. &quot;It's a very functional view 
of religion.&quot;</p>
