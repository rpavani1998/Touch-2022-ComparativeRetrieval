<p>'Family Guy'</p> Twentieth Century Fox <br>
<br>

<h3>Premiere and Cancellation:</h3> <i>Family Guy</i> premiered on January 31, 
1999. Like<i>Futurama</i>, <i>Family Guy</i> originally aired on Fox. After Fox 
moved the show around to various timeslots, the<i>Family Guy</i> drew low 
ratings and was cancelled in 2002. Later, Adult Swim began airing re-runs. With 
high ratings on Adult Swim, and brisk sales of the DVDs, FOX brought the show 
back onto the Sunday night schedule in 2005.
<p>The success of the show has spawned straight-to-DVD episodes, including a 
parody of the<i>Star Wars</i> trilogy beginning with &quot;Blue Harvest&quot;. 
Plus Seth MacFarlane and many of the cast members have performed in<i>Family 
Guy Live!</i>.</p>

<h3>Premise:</h3> <i>Family Guy</i> is an animated comedy that centers around 
Peter Griffin and his Griffin family, who live in Quahog, Rhode Island. The 
show features boundless cutaway scenes with pop culture references and makes 
fun of everyone from Luke Perry to KISS.

<h3>Characters:</h3>  Peter Griffin is the endearingly ignorant father. Lois 
is Peter's wife, a stay at home mom with no patience for her family's antics. 
17-year-old Meg is a social outcast and the Griffin family punching bag. 
13-year-old Chris is a socially awkward teen who doesn't have a clue about the 
opposite sex. Stewie is a diabolically clever baby. Rounding out the Griffin 
household is Brian, the family dog, who has a penchant for dry martinis and 
dumb blondes.

<h3>Creators:</h3>  Seth MacFarlane created <i>Family Guy</i>. He cut his 
teeth in animation on<i>Cow and Chicken</i>, <i>Johnny Bravo</i> and <i>
Dexter's Laboratory</i>. After <i>Family Guy</i>, he created <i>American Dad</i>
 and<i>The Cleveland Show</i>. He performs the voices of Peter, Stewie and 
Brian.

<h3>My Two Cents:</h3>  I became of fan of <i>Family Guy</i> during the very 
first episode, &quot;Death Has a Shadow.&quot; The set-up was the same as<i>The 
Simpsons</i>, a family-centered, sitcom-like comedy. But the humor was much 
more adult-oriented. My mouth dropped open more than once at some of the racier 
innuendos or spot-on parodies of pop culture moments.
<p>I still enjoy the show, but I'm no longer as shocked or entertained by it. 
Is it the decreased involvement of Seth MacFarlane, due to his other projects? 
Or is it just that I've become accustomed to the style of humor and animation?
</p> 
<p>Regardless, <i>Family Guy</i> is a forerunner of other cartoons who 
mercilessly skewer our pop culture and present rude jokes on mainstream 
television.</p> <br>
