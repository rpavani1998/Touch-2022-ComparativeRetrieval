<p>The ratings are respectable but everything did better that night and I wish 
The Simpsons could defeat Family Guy sometimes but this is nowhere near 
cancellation numbers</p> Reply <br>

<p>Screw Family Guy. This episode was a very good one. I&rsquo;m tempted to 
say that this ranks as one of my favorites of all time. Season 21 is going to 
be great!</p> Reply <br>

<p>Im a huge simpsons fan but i was disappointed with this episode it only 
revolved around homer and comic book guy it should have been involved with 
other Simpsons characters not comic book guy he&rsquo;s one of my least 
favorite characters.<br>

<p>The numbers were good, but they could be higher. As big of a Simpsons fan I 
am, FG was funnier last Sunday. THOH XX needs to pull in over 10 million 
viewers.</p> Reply <br>

<p>Hey Smiles I don&rsquo;t know what planet you been livin on but there is no 
way anyone could say that piece of crap season premiere could be ranked in 
ranked in anything, unless it&rsquo;s suckiest episodes of all time. I think 
these ratings will be a sign to come that The Simpsons dominance on Sundays is 
over. Family Guy was freakin hilarious and even the Cleavland Show was better! 
Time for Simpsons writers to man up and produce some quality episodes before we 
loose complete interest.</p> Reply <br>

<p>Honestly, I expected more. I thought that rates will be around 10 million, 
but this is still not bad for a first episode of new season.</p> 
<p>I also hope that THOH will bring much bigger number of viewers, and I think 
that we will be pleasantly surprised! </p> Reply <br>

<p>The cynical part of me expected it to be 4 million, so I suppose its an 
alright figure.</p> 
<p>I won&rsquo;t lie, figures are gonna go down. People see the first episode 
and as some will stay, people expect to see a good start and won&rsquo;t get 
it. I expect to see it in the low 7&prime;s, high 8&prime;s for the next few 
weeks till THOH.</p> 
<p>If I&rsquo;m honest, Family Guy is starting to become more and more popular 
around the world and we&rsquo;ve gotta accept that. Certainly in the USA and 
thats the way it&rsquo;ll be certainly until one or either dies out. Though 
around the world, I do believe it will always remain the best.</p> 
<p>And to those say they&rsquo;ll stop watching/lose intrest, you won&rsquo;t

<p>Dont know where you&rsquo;re getting those figures from Marbat, but 
they&rsquo;re incorrect.</p> Reply <br>

<p>I think he&rsquo;s rating the quality of the episodes, not the # of viewers.

<p>I guess because The Cleveland Show was the series premiere, its beating The 
Simpsons is understandable&hellip; since it was good, not great, hopefully 
it&rsquo;ll settle down nicely with American Dad in the future.</p> Reply <br>

<p>Could someone tell us which rates are relevant? I don&rsquo;t really 
understand the way they can estimate how much people have seen some show&hellip;

<p>Get well Adam, don&rsquo;t worry about us, we&rsquo;ll wait for the new 
information, and I am really impressed with your enthusiasm about simpsons 
channel!</p> 
<p>Anyway, I saw this episode, and I think that this is one of the best season 
opening episode in years! Although episode had really simple plot, it had tons 
of great humor. I am also very happy with the art- There are no more heavy 
shadows like in the Simpsons Movie, more segments of the show are hand drawn 
instead computer animated, and all in all everything looks more natural.</p> 
<p>If other episodes in this season are as good as this one, there in 
absolutely no reason for worrying about the future of the show!</p> Reply <br>
