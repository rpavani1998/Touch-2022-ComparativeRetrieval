<h3>More Simpson Shenanigans</h3> 
<p>Following the Kwik-E-Mart 7/11 story I started snooping around for other 
Simpson related marketing tactics and asked myself the question: why doesn't 
anyone fret about the fact that our yellow friends are being exploited by all 
kinds of corporate icons all over the globe? I'm a pretty big fan myself and I 
don't really seem to bother either...</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>I mean, just follow up on all the different activities here, the 
Kwik-E-Mart in Seven Eleven (follow up onthis blog), it all looks fantastic, 
even though some of the stuff is justreally clever promotional stuff (check out 
their destination guide on the same page). And then there's this YouTube film 
which I can imagine being claimed in the following days or weeks:</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>The answer probably lies withing their family: none of the Simpsons (apart 
from Lisa, and even she can have her moments) were ever ashamed to let 
themselves be used if there was any fame, money, reputation, status,... to be 
gained.</p> 
<p>And in that way they are much like modern consumers: we know Google 
probably has more data on us than we keep ourselves, we know advertising is 
paying for media, we willingly pay a premium for products which create a 
compelling story around themselves. And while we know all that, rationally, we 
let our hearts, our fantasies, our emotions take over when shop, read, listen, 
travel,...</p> 
<p>I don't think there ever was a group of media characters who reflected our 
own lives so well (the sheer volume of the series helps out here), there's a 
bit of us in every Simpson and a bit of Simpson in everyone of us, and that's 
probably why they can get away with this kind of stuff.</p> 
<p>Imagine what they get in return and ask yourselves if you would turn down 
the deal...</p>

<h2>Reading (or trying to read)</h2> 
<ul> 
<li> <br>

<p>Garth Ennis: Garth Ennis' Chronicles of Wormwood<br>
I seem to be on a bit 
of an Ennis binge lately after starting with The Boys, but this is actually 
just as good.</p></li> 
<li> <br>

<p>Bill Willingham: Fables: Legends in Exile (Vertigo)<br>
How would snow 
white cope in the real world? And what would the wolf be like? Answers in here. 
I'm a bit too late to discover this and am having a hard time finding the 
second bundle, if anyone can help me out let me know.</p></li> 
<li> <br>

<p>Garth Ennis: The Boys: The Name of the Game v. 1<br>
Garth Ennis produces 
another corker, an government funded anti superhero team saves the day. And 
this time they're the good guys...</p></li> 
<li> <br>

<p>R Gold: The Plenitude Creativity, Innovation and Making Stuff: Creativity, 
Innovation, and Making Stuff (Simplicity: Design, Technology, Business, Life): 
Creativity, ... Design, Technology, Business, Life)<br>
Rich Gold was probably 
one of the most unique creative thinkers around, a truly multidisciplinary 
genius and probably far too modest. A must read for everyone involved in ideas, 
the form really doesn't matter.</p></li> 
<li> <br>

<p>Garr Reynolds: Presentation Zen: Simple Ideas on Presentation Design and 
Delivery (Voices That Matter)<br>
Almost as good as the site. And the intro is 
pretty good when you're trying to convince people to stop using PPT as a bullet 
point generator.</p></li> 
<li> <br>

<p>Francis Preve: The Remixer's Bible: Build Better Beats<br>
Fancy me 
building better beats ;-) This is quite good actually, I'd be better of 
polishing up on some of the basics but this has got some really cool tips and 
tweaks.</p></li> 
<li> <br>

<p>Crispin Porter: Hoopla<br>
Probably one of the hottest shops around, so I 
was kind of curious. An intense experience for a book...</p></li> 
<li> <br>

<p>Mike Carey: Hellblazer: Gift<br>
I've picked up on the series again, and it 
remains quite good.</p></li> 
<li> <br>

<p>Ernie Schenck: The Houdini Solution<br>
Learn to think inside the box...</p>
</li> 
<li> <br>

<p>J. K. Rowling: Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows<br>
It's over, and it 
was a great ride... fantastic stuff;</p></li> </ul> 
<h2>Ears &amp; Feet</h2> 
<ul> 
<li>Beyond The Wizards Sleeve: Beyond The Wizards Sleeve Ark 1<br>
Erol Alkan 
and Richard Norris on a psychedelic trip with Kraut- and Postrock influences 
all over. Great stuff but a tad harder to find, check out the Rough Trade 
webstore if you're interested.</li> 
<li> <br>

<p>Various Artists: Kitsune Maison Vol.6<br>
Latest in an excellent series, 
with highlights from Lo-Fi-Fnk and Grovesnor (a great Hot Chip remix)</p></li> 
<li> <br>

<p>Various Artists: Ed Rec Vol.3<br>
Pedro Winter and the boys from the Ed 
Banger label are still very much alive. Some purists might try and tell you 
otherwise but they've still got it. Not for the neurotics among us though.</p>
</li> 
<li> <br>

<p>Hollywood Mon Amour: Hollywood Mon Amour<br>
I'd never take this out on the 
basis of the tracklist, but the female vocals and the attention to detail to 
every last song on here makes it into something truly fantastic.</p></li> 
<li> <br>

<p>Rodrigo Y Gabriela: Rodrigo Y Gabriela [CD + DVD]<br>
Oooh, fantastic! Sexy 
sweet latin american guitar sounds, but uptempo with a tight rhythm and more 
than enough balls.</p></li> 
<li> <br>

<p>Boys Noize: Bugged Out Presents Suck My Deck: Mixed By Boys Noize<br>

Excellent overview of some of the hottest stuff from the past years (with some 
rare, reworked classics dropped in for good measure). If you want to get a 
taste of what a dirty dancefloor can offer today, this is a fantastic place to 
start...</p></li> 
<li> <br>

<p>Carl Craig: Sessions<br>
Still going strong after so many years, and this 
(rare) compilation makes it that much clearer. And 'throw' will get you every 
time...</p></li> 
<li> <br>

<p>Hercules &amp; Love Affair: Hercules and Love Affair<br>
Ooooh, disco as it 
should be... Do check out the Frankie Knuckles remix of Blind as well.</p></li> 
<li> <br>

<p>Alter Ego: Why Not ?!<br>
Funhouse techno redefined. Completely bonkers and 
all the better for it.</p></li> 
<li> <br>

<p>Daft Punk: Alive 2007<br>
If you had not noticed, I love this album... this 
is Daft Punk at their best. Harder, faster, better than a normal album, and the 
crowd noise just makes it better</p></li> </ul>
