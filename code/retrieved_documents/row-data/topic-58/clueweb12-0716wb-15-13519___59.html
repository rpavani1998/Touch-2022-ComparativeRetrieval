<h2> What&rsquo;s under your fingernails? </h2> So, I have this buddy named 
Spike Jones. Pretty smart dude. And in April when we were having lunch a few 
hours before my workshop, we got talking about the topic of identity.<br>
<br>

&ldquo;Well, what about you, Scott?&rdquo; he asked.<br>
<br>

&ldquo;What&rsquo;s under YOUR fingernails?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
A chill ran down my 
spine.<br>
<br>
<i>Wow. What a question. What a thought.</i> I&rsquo;ll never 
forget the feeling of allowing those four words to profoundly penetrate me.<br>

<br>What&rsquo;s. Under. Your. Fingernails. <br>
<br>
So, as I racked my brain, 
Spike said, &ldquo;See, the work you do &ndash; if it truly matters &ndash; 
becomes a part of you.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Like the mechanic who never 
really loses the oil stains under his fingernails, our work stays with us 
wherever we go. It becomes a part of our language and our very being. Which 
isn&rsquo;t to say work is EVERYTHING. But if your work is your calling &ndash; 
not just your job &ndash; you will embrace it in everything you do.&rdquo;<br>

<br>Holy crap. <br>
<br>
Ever since that fateful conversation, I&rsquo;ve been 
thinking a lot about my fingernails. And I realize there&rsquo;s really two 
ways you can answer that question: literally and metaphorically.<br>
<br>
So, 
here&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s (literally) under my fingernails:<br>
<br>
1. 
Metallic bronze dust from the strings on myTaylor 814-CE guitar. <br>
2. Stains 
of blue Sharpie from hand-writing tens of thousands of nametags.<br>
3. A 
decade&rsquo;s worth of chlorine from countless laps of stress-relieving 
freestyle.<br>
4. Metallic silver residue from daily pounding on the 78 keys on 
my MacBook Pro.<br>
5. Rainbow cotton fibers from every content note card 
I&rsquo;ve ever laid out on the floor.<br>
<br>
Next, here&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s 
(metaphorically) under my fingernails:<br>
<br>
1. Every email from every 
random person whose life improved in some way as a result of reading something 
I wrote.<br>
2. Every email from every random person who told me how stupid I 
was, or how stupid my idea was.<br>
3. Any of the 5000 creative, penetrating, 
thought-provoking questions I&rsquo;ve collected, dissected and incorporated 
into my lexicon over the years.<br>
<br>
- - - <br>
<br>
Essentially, this 
question boils down to a new philosophy, a new paradigm and a new approach to 
our work. As inspired by Spike's original post and my hommies @Brains On Fire: 
<br> <br>
<b>Work IS play.</b> <br>
That means infusing your childlike energy 
into everything you do. For the advancement and enhancement of your creative 
spirit. For the reciprocation of that spirit into the souls of the people you 
serve.<br>
<br>
<b>Work IS pleasure.</b> <br>
That means at the airport ticket 
counter when the agent asks, &ldquo;Is this trip business or pleasure?&rdquo; 
learning to respond, &ldquo;Same thing for me!&rdquo; &ldquo;Always 
both!&rdquo; or &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the difference?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
<b>Work IS 
personal.</b> <br>
That means our technology has made it easy to take the 
personal-ness for granted. Which is exactly why you need to work so hard at 
getting personally involved. To prove that a few rounds of golf or some Chamber 
of Commerce meeting isn&rsquo;t the extent of your &ldquo;getting to know 
you&rdquo; time with clients.<br>
<br>
<b>Work MEANS hitting the streets. </b> 
<br>That means getting out of your office and actually talking and listening to 
the people who (really) pay your salary &ndash; the customers. And not in focus 
groups, online surveys or some other form of contrived, unrealistic 
cross-section of people you THINK speak for the entire group. We&rsquo;re 
talking about real-life, face-to-face, organic human inquiry, conversation and 
connection. Something that doesn&rsquo;t have a structure, agenda or regimented 
time limit.<br>
<br>
<b>Work MEANS getting your hands dirty.</b> <br>
That 
means becoming involved (even if it&rsquo;s just a little) in the production, 
manufacturing, research, exploration and baseline development of your 
company&rsquo;s ideas. Getting your butt out of the office and into the 
warehouse.<br>
<br>
<b>Work MEANS engaging face-to-face with customers.</b> <br>
That means hanging with them. Learning their language. Drinking their Kool-Aid. 
Watching them in action as they gain value from your product or service so you 
can more accurately report back on the posture of the masses.<br>
<br>

<h2> 4 Ways to Listen to Yourself </h2> Growing bigger ears is about listening 
to others, listening to the world, and of course, listening to YOURSELF.<br>

<br>Today we&rsquo;re going to focus on the latter. <br>
<br>
Here are four 
practices to help you listen to yourself more effectively. <br>
<br>
<b>1. TAKE 
WALKS &hellip; with yourself.</b> <br>
Also known as &ldquo;moving 
meditation,&rdquo; taking a walk is a perfect way to enlist your truest, most 
important thoughts. Walking clears your mind, stabilizes your emotions and 
levels your perspective. And walking also taps into your higher consciousness 
and attracts thoughts, ideas and solutions to current problems.<br>
<br>
Even 
if that means walking around the block or down to the street to Starbucks.<br>

<br> REMEMBER: Solvitas perambulatorum! (More on this philosophy here.) <br>

<br> <b>2. DO SOME WRITING &hellip; with yourself. </b> <br>
Undertaking daily 
exercises like journaling, guiding writing orMorning Pages will (probably) be 
the BEST way to listen to yourself. Writing is the great clarifier. It&rsquo;s 
a ritual of reflection, a psychological holding environment and gateway to your 
inner and higher self, as Julia Cameron suggests in<i>The Artist&rsquo;s Way.
</i> <br>
<br>
For example, think back to those essay tests you took in 
college. Your professor probably said something like; &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t 
(truly) know the material until you can write about it.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
And, 
that goes for your inner thoughts too: you don&rsquo;t truly know what you 
think and feel about something until you can write about it.<br>
<br>
REMEMBER: 
Writing is the basis of all wealth.<br>
<br>
<b>3. MEDITATE &hellip; with 
yourself.</b> <br>
TM. Yoga. Guided imagery. Daily appontments. Self-hypnosis. 
Mindfulness breathing. Relaxation CD&rsquo;s. Any of these will work! The word 
&ldquo;meditate&rdquo; comes from the Latin meditatus, which means, &quot;To 
think over, consider.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
The TYPE of meditation you choose to use 
isn&rsquo;t as important as THAT you choose to meditate. Every single day.<br>

<br>Ans when you meditate, you calm your mind. And when your mind is calm 
&ndash; like a still body of water &ndash; you can more effectively see (and 
listen to) your own reflection.<br>
<br>
REMEMBER: Meditation is listening. <br>
<br> <b>4. HAVE DISCUSSIONS &hellip; with yourself.</b> <br>
Self-questioning 
is a powerful tool for listening to yourself. The challenge is figuring out 
which questions to ask.<br>
<br>
I suggest combing this practice with #2, 
writing. Consider spending some time writing out your answers to such questions 
as:<br>
<br>
1. Is this an opportunity or an opportunity to be used? <br>
2. Is 
this the best use of my time right now?<br>
3. Is what I&rsquo;m doing right 
now consistent with my #1 goal?<br>
4. What does this have to do with me? <br>

5. What have I been noticing a lot of lately?<br>
6. What is my body telling me 
right now?<br>
7. What lessons have I recently learned? <br>
<br>
REMEMBER: He 
who asks the best questions, wins.<br>
<br>
Ultimately, you can&rsquo;t listen 
to others until you&rsquo;ve first learned how to listen to yourself. Consider 
these four practices and grow bigger ears today!<br>
<br>

<br>What is your body telling you right now? <br>

<h2> PhD, schmee-h-D </h2> You don&rsquo;t need a Masters. <br>
You 
don&rsquo;t need a PhD.<br>
In fact, you don&rsquo;t need ANY acronyms, letters 
or designations after your last name.<br>
<br>
<b>You need experience(s).</b> 
<br> <br>
That&rsquo;s what people trust. <br>
That&rsquo;s what people relate 
to.<br>
That&rsquo;s what people use to judge you. <br>
That&rsquo;s what 
people validate your expertise by.<br>
That&rsquo;s what people measure your 
credibility by.<br>
<br>
I think IBM pioneer Tom Watson said it best, 
&ldquo;Good judgment comes from experience. And experience comes from bad 
judgment.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
<b>You need experience(s).</b> <br>
<br>
AND, along 
WITH those experiences, three other things:<br>
<br>
FIRST: Constant and 
intelligent reflection upon those experiences.<br>
Because, as my mentor, 
William Jenkins taught me, &ldquo;We learn not from our experiences but from 
intelligent reflection UPON those experiences.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
So, as you 
experience life, remember to ask yourself:<br>
<br>
1. How are these issues 
related to each other?<br>
2. How can I profit from this experience? <br>
3. 
How can I use this idea, principle or technique to achieve my goals or solve my 
problems?<br>
4. How can this mistake be quickly made into something good? <br>

5. How could this mentor me?<br>
6. How does this fit into my theory of the 
universe?<br>
7. Is there anyone in my life that I treat this way? <br>
8. Now 
that I&rsquo;ve done this, what else does this make possible?<br>
9. What 
happened to me during this experience?<br>
10. What is another use for this 
failure?<br>
11. What went right/wrong/perfectly about what JUST happened? <br>

12. What worked well and why?<br>
<br>
SECOND: An extraction of lessons 
learned. Because nobody cares what you did. Nobody cares what you know. They 
only care what you&rsquo;ve LEARNED; and, how those lessons can help them 
improve their lives.<br>
<br>
Therefore, as you experience life, remember to 
ask yourself:<br>
<br>
1. Can I transfer this information into something else I 
do?<br>
2. How can the basic concept be applied to different areas? <br>
3. How 
many different ways can you leverage this?<br>
4. In what kind of future 
situations could I use these learnings?<br>
5. What did I JUST learn from this 
experience?<br>
6. What did you experience today that taught you something 
about your work or life?<br>
7. What else is like this? <br>
8. What have I 
seen, read or done today that relates to another idea or theme in my life right 
now?<br>
9. What&rsquo;s the Universal Human Emotion/Experience? <br>
<br>
THIRD
: A platform to share those lessons learned. If you don&rsquo;t write it down, 
it NEVER HAPPENED. And, writing is the basis of all wealth. The challenge is, 
how are you going to share that with the world?<br>
<br>
Well, as you 
experience life, remember to ask yourself:<br>
<br>
1. What type of list could 
I immediately make my idea into?<br>
2. What journal does this go into? <br>
3. 
When will I write about this?<br>
4. How many different ways can I share this 
intellectual property?<br>
5. If I were to share these lessons in a speech, 
what would I say?<br>
6. How can I make this experience useful to my fellow 
human beings?<br>
7. How can I make writing a part of this? <br>
8. How can I 
conduct a debriefing?<br>
9. Who else needs to see this? <br>
<br>
REMEMBER: If 
you want to prove your credibility and validate your expertise, you need 
experiences.<br>
<br>
AND, you need to compound those experiences with a system 
of reflection, extraction and sharing.<br>
<br>
If you can do that, people will 
no longer have to ask the question: &ldquo;So, is this your direct personal 
experience, or are you just quoting someone else?&rdquo;<br>

<h2> &quot;Is there anyone in my life that I treat this way?&quot; </h2> 
It&rsquo;s incredibly convenient to observe someone&rsquo;s inappropriate 
behavior and immediately pass judgment on that person.<br>
<br>
<i>Man, that 
guy is really being rude to the waitress&hellip;<br>
<br>
I can&rsquo;t believe 
that woman just said that to her daughter!<br>
<br>
How could she be so 
inconsiderate of the people around her?</i> <br>
<br>
See, our egos LOVE this 
stuff because these silent dialogues immediately make us feel superior to the 
people around us.<br>
<br>
Ironically, pointing out someone else&rsquo;s 
judgmental behavior IS, in fact, judgmental.<br>
<br>
SO, HERE&rsquo;S YOUR TASK
: Turn inward.<br>
<br>
Upon observing any type of foul behavior, use it as a 
mirror. A bell of awareness.<br>
<br>
Ask yourself: <br>
<br>
<b>&ldquo;Is 
there anyone in my life that I treat this way?&rdquo;</b> <br>
<br>
That way, 
instead of pointing out others&rsquo; faults to camouflage your own, you can 
take this moment of introspection and create some movement in the development 
of your own character.<br>

<h2> No customer has ever said, &quot;Wow, you return calls too fast!&quot; 
</h2> THREE WORDS OF ADVICE: Return calls faster. <br>
<br>
Calls meaning calls.
<br>Calls meaning emails. <br>
Calls meaning text messages. <br>
Calls meaning 
any other form of instant communication.<br>
<br>
<i>We HAVE the technology. 
And it&rsquo;s not like it takes a lot of time.</i> <br>
<br>
So, make it your 
new goal to return calls faster.<br>
<br>
Within reason, that is. Obviously, 
you can&rsquo;t immediately address EVERY single attention magnet that crosses 
your path.<br>
<br>
But when you can, reduce your average response time. <br>

<br>For three reasons: <br>
<br>
<b>1. It&rsquo;s memorable.</b> When you call 
a customer back right away, it&rsquo;s unexpected. This is a good thing. After 
all:<i>The most effective way to capture customers&rsquo; attention is to 
B-R-E-A-K her patterns</i>. And, in a world of ineffective, impersonal customer 
service, doing so will immediatelyset you apart from everyone else who takes 
three days to reply.<br>
<br>
<b>2. It demonstrates that you value people.</b> 
The speed of the response IS the response. The medium IS the message. So, when 
customers are replied to immediately, they feel special.<i>And listened to. And 
important. And valued.</i> Which makes them want to continue doing business 
with you.<br>
<br>
<b>3. It builds trust.</b> Sure, quickly returning a phone 
call or email is small thing. But it&rsquo;s the accumulation of those small 
things that builds familiarity and predictability.<i>This approachable action 
positively frames the entire customer encounter.</i> It sets the stage for 
successful service and informs the customer how she can expect to be treated 
from here on in. And THAT IS how you build trust.<br>
<br>
Now, some people 
will make arguments against this style of communication.<br>
<br>
That it might 
come off as desperate.<br>
<br>
That it might destroy your Big Shot allure. <br>
<br>Well, maybe that&rsquo;s true in some cases. <br>
<br>
All I know is, 
I&rsquo;ve been practicing this principle whenever possible.<br>
<br>
And 
I&rsquo;ve NEVER had a customer say, &quot;Wow, you return calls too fast!&quot;
<br> <br>
So, even if you&rsquo;re skeptical about returning calls faster, I 
still challenge you to increase your average response time.<br>
<br>
Because 
nobody else does stuff like that.<br>
<br>
And usually, the stuff nobody else 
does tends to be the stuff customers love.<br>
<br>
LET ME ASK YA THIS? <br>

Are you returning calls faster than your competitors?<br>

THIS...<br>

<h2> The Ultimate Dream Statement&trade; </h2> Creative solutions. <br>
Famous 
inventions.<br>
Groundbreaking innovations. <br>
<br>
All of these bright ideas 
hinge on your ability to complete the following sentence:<br>
<br>
<b>I wish 
there was a/an (X) so I wouldn&rsquo;t have to (Y)!</b> <br>
<br>
I call this 
<i>The Ultimate Dream Statement&trade;</i>, or UDS for short. And it (might) be 
the most important idea an entrepreneur could entertain.<br>
<br>
Let&rsquo;s 
explore the two elements within:<br>
<br>
<b>1. I WISH THERE WAS A/AN 
(X)&hellip;</b> <br>
So, it&rsquo;s dream focused. Optimistic. Solution 
oriented. It&rsquo;s what customers want in an ideal world. The answer to their 
problems. The Tylenol for their headache. The relief they so desperately need. 
The (X).<br>
<br>
<b>2. &hellip;SO I WOULDN&rsquo;T HAVE TO (Y)!</b> <br>
As a 
result of purchasing (X), they&rsquo;re saving time. Or money. Or energy. Or 
paper. Or manpower. Or opportunity cost. Whatever. The key is, by eliminating 
(Y), the customer moves away from pain and towards pleasure.<br>
<br>
OK! Now 
that you understand the root of this concept, let&rsquo;s try a few. See if you 
can guess the already existing product that, at one point in time, was 
considered a groundbreaking innovation:<br>
<br>
<i>&ldquo;I wish there was a 
way to see our vacation pictures RIGHT NOW so we wouldn&rsquo;t have to wait 
until we got home next week.&rdquo;</i> <br>
<br>
So, what&rsquo;s the product? 
<br> <br>
OF COURSE! Polaroid and (eventually) digital cameras. <br>
<br>

Let&rsquo;s try another one&hellip;<br>
<br>
<i>&ldquo;I wish there was a fast 
forward button so I wouldn't have to sit through those atrocious 
commercials.&rdquo;</i> <br>
<br>
So, what&rsquo;s the product? <br>
<br>
OF 
COURSE! Tivo, or any other form of DVR. <br>
<br>
OK, last example&hellip; <br>

<br> <i>&ldquo;I wish there was a way to keep my kids quiet in the back seat of 
the car so I wouldn&rsquo;t feel like stabbing myself in the eye with a plastic 
spork!&rdquo;</i> <br>
<br>
So, what&rsquo;s the product? <br>
<br>
OF COURSE! 
Duct tape.<br>
<br>
Nah, just kidding. <br>
<br>
The real answer is <i>Backseat 
DVD Player</i>. What parent of four rug rats doesn&rsquo;t LOVE that invention! 
<br> <br>
NOW, HERE&rsquo;S THE COOL PART: This innovation process works in 
reverse, too. You can take any of your most cherished toys, gadgets or products 
and extract their version of<i>The Ultimate Dream Statement&trade;.</i> <br>

<br>For example, think about your iPod. The UDS would be: <br>
<br>
<i>&quot;I 
wish there was a way to compile all of my music onto a compact, digital storage 
device so I wouldn&rsquo;t have to lug 100 CD&rsquo;s in my car, to work and on 
the plane!</i>&quot; <br>
<br>
You get the point. <br>
<br>
<b>Make customers' 
dreams come true while simultaneously helping them avoid something frustrating.
</b> <br>
<br>
<i>Move closer to pleasure, move further from pain.</i> <br>
<br>
NOW, HERE&rsquo;S THE INTERESTING PART: I did some googling with the phrases 
&ldquo;I wish there was a,&rdquo; and &ldquo;so I wouldn&rsquo;t have 
to&hellip;&rdquo;<br>
<br>
And after searching through a few hundred blogs, 
message boards and forums, here are my favorite examples:<br>
<br>
* <i>&quot;I 
wish there was a way to pick the flavors I prefer, so I wouldn't have to throw 
any away.&quot;<br>
<br>
*&quot;I wish there was a website that would just tell 
me where to go so I wouldn't have to stress about this stuff.&quot;<br>
<br>

*&quot;I wish there was a Digg.com that morons couldn't find so I wouldn't have 
to read such dim-witted remarks anymore.&quot;<br>
<br>
*&quot;I wish there was 
a way on the adapter to turn up the volume a bit so I wouldn&rsquo;t have to 
turn the volume pretty high to get &quot;normal&quot; volume&quot;<br>
<br>

*&quot;I wish there was a way to get my seats reassigned online so I wouldn't 
have to get up early.&quot;<br>
<br>
*&quot;I wish there was a drive thru 
Wal-Mart where I could just pull up to the window and order what I wanted so I 
wouldn't have to wake my baby up and take her into the store.&quot;<br>
<br>

*&quot;I wish there was a way to refresh our brains and wipe the slate clean so 
we would not have to learn new good habits and relearn not to do bad 
habits.&quot;<br>
<br>
*&quot;I wish there was a tutorial somewhere where I 
could learn to do this stuff on my own so I wouldn't have to pester you 
all!&quot;<br>
<br>
*&quot;I wish there was a dustpan with a long stick on it 
like the broom handle so I wouldn&rsquo;t have to hold the dustpan.&quot;<br>

<br>*&quot;I wish my pump could measure my sugar reading so that I wouldn't 
have to worry about the cost of the glucose meter supplies.&quot;<br>
<br>

*&quot;I wish there was a Depresso-Meter that I could use to measure my current 
mental state so that I wouldn't have to deal with people asking me all the time 
'What is wrong?'&quot;</i> <br>
<br>
- - - <br>
<br>
Now, obviously, some of 
these ideas are more far-fetched than others.<br>
<br>
But that&rsquo;s a good 
thing.<br>
<br>
After all, Einstein once said, &ldquo;If at first your idea 
does not sound absurd, there is no hope for it.&rdquo;<br>

<h2> Grow Creative Ears, Part 3 </h2> In the first post of this series, we 
explored a list of things, forces, people and situations to &ldquo;actively 
listen to&rdquo; so you could grow your creative practice.<br>
<br>
In the 
second post, we explored a list of things NOT to listen to for maximum creative 
output.<br>
<br>
In this third and final post on <i>creativity as active 
listening</i>, I wanted to share a few observations from my own creative 
practice, along with a collection of probing questions to challenge your own:
<br> <br>
<b>1. Become an expert at NOTICING.</b> That means discerning those 
little details that send your brain off to the creative races. Ancillary 
answers, happy accidents, internal comments, what&rsquo;s around you, what 
doesn&rsquo;t work and how quickly people understand and respond to your ideas. 
It also means<i>Meta Noticing</i>: Noticing the fact THAT you&rsquo;re 
noticing. Because awareness is the first step towards mastery.<br>
<br>
LISTEN 
TO THIS: What are you noticing? <br>
<br>
<b>2. Creation = Reaction.</b> 
Literally. It&rsquo;s an anagram. Same letters. (Cool, huh?) So, watch how you 
immediately react to things. Notice how you take in information and process 
experiences. Observe the mobilization of your inner resources, for these 
movements will allow you to create something beautiful.<br>
<br>
LISTEN TO THIS
: Are you listening and watching your initial responses?<br>
<br>
<b>3. 
Curiosity is active response to life.</b> It&rsquo;s about observation, 
followed by questions. Asking yourself, asking others, asking the world. Spying 
on the universe. Metabolizing the strands and tendrils of so many sparkling 
creatures and melding them into your own reality. Participating in the world 
around you as fully and actively as you possibly can.<br>
<br>
LISTEN TO THIS: 
Are you asking enough questions?<br>
<br>
<b>4. Everything is fodder</b>. I 
repeat: Everything.<i>Material. Content. Ingredients.</i> The world is one 
big-ass idea market, and it&rsquo;s all F-R-E-E! There are no lines, and 
coupons are irrelevant. If you see something you like and you want, and you 
take it. Then, when you get home, you mix it with related thoughts and conjure 
something bigger, as you become bigger yourself.<br>
<br>
LISTEN TO THIS: From 
which unusual and obscure places do you get your material?<br>
<br>
<b>5. 
Everything is prey.</b> No limitations. Nothing is off-limits. Everything is 
fair game. Whatever the artist sees, he or she can use. Steal. Pluck. Insert. 
Capture. Marry ideas with other ideas. (Of course, this doesn&rsquo;t mean 
plagiarism. It means capturing the essence of something and making it your own. 
So be careful!)<br>
<br>
LISTEN TO THIS: What did you extract today? <br>
<br>

<b>6. Learn to freeze things.</b> All this fodder, this material surrounding 
you - that you eat and perceive through your personal filter &ndash; you must 
be able to F-R-E-E-Z-E. That means you see something, take a Mental Polaroid of 
it and then clothespin it onto your psyche for further evaluation. As it 
freezes, you view it from all angles. You walk 360 degrees around it. You 
investigate it. Ask it questions. Maybe poke it a little. Rip its clothes off, 
strip it of every outer layer until its essence plops down on that imaginary 
interrogation chair, staring at you.<br>
<br>
LISTEN TO THIS: Are you freezing 
your observations?<br>
<br>
<b>7. Listen, listen and listen.</b> Listen to your 
work from a cool, objective distance. But be sure to do so in a way that 
prevents you from falling in love with your work. (This prevents emotions from 
disturbing the process.) See, that&rsquo;s all writers do: they listen. To the 
world, to the people, to the ideas that zoom and fly in, to what their hearts 
are telling them to write. So, never stop listening. Identify the language of 
your own thought.<br>
<br>
LISTEN TO THIS: Are you writing or listening? <br>

<br> <b>8. Notice your soundscapes.</b> Anyone who says, &ldquo;I never have 
any good ideas,&rdquo; or &ldquo;I have writer&rsquo;s block&rdquo; or 
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing good out there,&rdquo; &hellip; IS A TERRIBLE 
LISTENER. To themselves. To the world. To others.<i>No ideas?</i> Bullshit. 
They&rsquo;re everywhere! You just need to figure out what wants to be written. 
To figure out what your Muse is telling you. To figure out what new piece of 
material is standing by for your plucking. Remember: Opportunity never stops 
knocking &ndash; only YOU stop listening. So, saddle up. Finger through the 
jukebox of your creative mind and locate that ONE unique song you&rsquo;re 
supposed to be singing. Then, belt it out!<br>
<br>
LISTEN TO THIS: 
What&rsquo;s your excuse for NOT having any good ideas?<br>
<br>
<b>9. 
Perpetually hunt for insight.</b> Inspiration is ENDLESS and EVERYWHERE. And if 
you maintain an attitude of curiosity, exploration and expectation in 
everything you do, it&rsquo;s yours for the plucking. So, be constantly 
scanning. Like one of those secret service dudes with one hand on their gun and 
the other on their earpiece. Ceaselessly looking around, sweeping the crowd and 
scrutinizing the scene for things and people that don&rsquo;t belong. Allowing 
objects and events and people to let loose some movement in your mind.<br>
<br>

LISTEN TO THIS: What little things do you always seem to notice? <br>
<br>
<b>
10. Register the moment.</b> Mark it down. Label it. Name it. Call it 
something. Then, put it where it needs to go. (Not in an overly specific way, 
as you don&rsquo;t want to prematurely, cognitively commit to something.) Just 
enough where it can go somewhere with its friends. Where it fits in. Where it 
belongs. Where it can be returned to a later time and picked up exactly where 
it left off.<br>
<br>
LISTEN TO THIS: Where does this new idea belong? <br>
<br>
<b>11. Scanning.</b> Find interesting in anything. Study ordinary things 
intently. See yourself in anything. Plug whatever you perceive into the 
equations of your topic and your philosophy and expertise. Ask yourself how it 
relates to you, why it&rsquo;s interesting, how it&rsquo;s an example or symbol 
of something that&rsquo;s important to you.<br>
<br>
LISTEN TO THIS: What 
mundane things do you find fascinating?<br>
<br>
- - - <br>
<br>
REMEMBER: 
Creativity is the ultimate form of active listening.<br>
<br>
So, learn what to 
listen to. Learn what (not) to listen to.<br>
<br>
Practice being silently 
attentive and letting your art be subordinate to your life.<br>
<br>
LET ME ASK 
YA THIS...<br>
How are you using you ears as a creative tool? <br>

<h2> Your hand doesn&rsquo;t have to shoot up first </h2> My parents&rsquo; 
favorite childhood tale to tell &ndash; mainly to embarrass me, I assume 
&ndash; is called &ldquo;The Hand Raiser.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
(Apparently) when I 
was four years old, my folks used to watch my pre-school class through a 
one-way mirror.<br>
<br>
The school I attended provided an Observation Room so 
parents could observe their kids completely without distracting students or 
teachers. Ultimately, the goal was to present them with a clear picture of how 
their children interacted during school.<br>
<br>
Now, contrary to frequent 
assumption, I was NOT the class clown.<br>
<br>
My behavior was a little 
different.<br>
<br>
See, if you ask my mother, she&rsquo;ll proudly tell you, 
&ldquo;Whenever the teacher posed a question, asked for participation or 
requested a student&rsquo;s help &hellip; Scott&rsquo;s hand would ALWAYS shoot 
up first! Sometimes before the teacher even finished talking!&rdquo;<br>
<br>

To which I&rsquo;ve always conceded,<i>Yeah. That sounds like me&hellip;</i> 
<br> <br>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s like, it didn&rsquo;t matter WHAT the question 
was,&rdquo; my Dad often adds. &ldquo;Scott just wanted to talk! He LOVED to 
participate in the discussion, even if he had no idea what he was talking 
about.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Ha! <i>Once again, guilty.</i> <br>
<br>
Now, keep in 
mind: I was only four years old at the time.<br>
<br>
Twenty-five years later, 
<i>I&rsquo;m all grows up and I&rsquo;m all grows up,</i> as Vince Vaughn would 
say. And I&rsquo;m proud to say I&rsquo;ve made GREAT progress in my listening 
practice.<br>
<br>
SEE, HERE&rsquo;S WHAT I&rsquo;VE LEARNED: Your hand 
doesn&rsquo;t have to shoot up first.<br>
<br>
<i>Show some restraint. Practice 
some patience. Just listen and wait for the answer. No need to pounce on every 
pause.</i> <br>
<br>
As my marketing professor, Dr. Speh, used to teach us, 
&ldquo;When you go to a meeting, don&rsquo;t say anything until the last five 
minutes. That way you can collect you thoughts, clarify your position and speak 
confidently.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Growing up, children create the perception that 
whoever hand shoots up first is the smartest person in the room.<br>
<br>
Not 
(always) true.<br>
<br>
Instead, biting your tongue until the end of the 
meeting (or group conversation, teleseminar, etc.) will net four key results:
<br> <br>
<b>1. By looking around, listening and learning FIRST, your 
eventually comment will contain its maximum amount of brilliance.</b> Because 
you will have perfected your answer by listening to others first.<br>
<br>
<b>
2. By asking yourself, &ldquo;Is it a sound instinct or a strong 
impulse?&rdquo; you learn to respond, not react.</b> This helps you become a 
better judge of which thoughts need to be shared, and which thoughts need to be 
shirked.<br>
<br>
<b>3. If you only say one thing, it become more profound, as 
scarcity creates a perception of value.</b> Think Silent Bob. He only voices 
one thought per movie, and it's always killer!<br>
<br>
<b>4. The longer you 
wait to say something, the more everybody else will want to know what 
you&rsquo;re thinking.</b> And your calmness, patience and quietude will draw 
them in.<br>
<br>
See, most meetings eventually come to a point where the 
leader or facilitator will say, &ldquo;OK, is there anything else?&rdquo; 
&ldquo;Does anybody have any questions?&rdquo; or &ldquo;Any final thoughts 
before we finish?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
At which point, all you have to say is, 
&ldquo;I had an observation&hellip;&rdquo;<br>
<br>
At which point, all the 
people in the room or around the table will turn their heads, rotate their 
chairs and look in the direction of the ONE person who hasn&rsquo;t said 
anything all morning.<br>
<br>
And the floor will be yours. <br>
<br>
REMEMBER: 
Your hand doesn&rsquo;t have to shoot up first.<br>
<br>
Ultimately, 
you&rsquo;ll increase your approachability without saying a word.<br>
<br>

ME ASK YA THIS...<br>

<h2> Don't leave it in the green room </h2> WARNING: Over rehearsing may cause 
you to leave some of your best stuff in the green room.<br>
<br>
Sure, you can 
rehearse a little bit.<br>
<br>
<i>So you prepare. Go over stuff. Try a few 
things out. Practice here and there.</i> <br>
<br>
But you never over rehearse. 
<br> <br>
Save THAT steam for the stage. <br>
<br>
Reserve your best juices, 
your strongest emotions and your most gorgeous extemporizations for the main 
event. The real deal. The big game. The showdown.<br>
<br>
Otherwise, your 
brilliance will bellow in vain, quietly smacking against a brick wall with 
nobody to appreciate its splendor but you, the housekeeping lady and (possibly) 
the guy in the next room over desperately trying to get some sleep. (And even 
he isn&rsquo;t really listening to you.)<br>
<br>
No, you&rsquo;d better call 
it a night. Reserve your truest ruminations for their ideal venue.<br>
<br>

Don&rsquo;t waste them on green room, or in some cases, the Holiday Inn.<br>

<br>Because once they come pouring out of your heart and through your lips, 
they may never resurface again.<br>
<br>
And that&rsquo;s just not fair to your 
Muse.<br>

<h2> Adventures in Nametagging: Sandusky Style </h2> Just finished a workshop 
in Sandusky with myYMCA friends in the Great Lakes Region! <br>
<br>
We had a 
blast, learned a lot, and enjoyed an unexpected amount of &quot;poop in the 
pool&quot; jokes.<br>
<br>
We also stayed at the Kalahari Resort in Sandusky. 
It's pretty much the coolest place I've ever stayed at. Sadly, I was unable to 
use any of their indoor waterpark facilities.<i>Dang it.</i> <br>
<br>
The good 
news is, I<i>did</i> eat a delicious sprinkle-topped, chocolate covered rice 
crispy treat on a stick.<i>So chronic.</i> <br>
<br>
Anyway, on a more serious 
note, I was driving from Sandusky back to Toledo when I heard a FANTASTIC song 
called &quot;I Love Everyone&quot; by an artist I'd never heard of before,Phil 
Roy. <br>
<br>
As a lifelong music fanatic and songwriter myself, I can 
honestly say that the chorus of this song contains one of the greatest lyrics 
my ears have ever tasted:<br>
<br>
<i>&quot;Today I'm gonna go face the world 
and just love everybody.&quot;</i> <br>
<br>
F***ing awesome. <br>

<h2> 22 Questions to Sidestep Entrepreneurial Atrophy </h2> As an 
entrepreneur, my decision making-process is usually based on self-questioning.
<br> <br>
So, anytime I take on a new project, trudge forward with a risky 
endeavor or discover a new way to diversify my company, I start grilling myself.
<br> <br>
What can I say? <i>I&rsquo;m obsessed with questions.</i> (As if you 
didn't already know that.)<br>
<br>
I collect them. <br>
I write about them. 
<br>I have a huge crush on them! <br>
<br>
BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY: I leverage 
them to grow my business.<br>
<br>
Today we&rsquo;re going to explore a list 
called<i>22 Questions to Sidestep Entrepreneurial Atrophy</i>. They&rsquo;re 
divided into four main categories:<br>
<br>
1. Financial <br>
2. Growth <br>
3. 
Asset<br>
4. Competition <br>
<br>
Let&rsquo;s get started&hellip; <br>
<br>
<b>
FINANCIAL QUESTIONS</b> <br>
<b>1. How can I turn this into an income stream?
</b> Always think leverage. Always find a way to kill two stones with one bird. 
Find a way to make money everywhere. Just be sure you&rsquo;re asking, 
&ldquo;HOW,&rdquo; and not &ldquo;CAN I?&rdquo; One is a possibility question; 
the other is a yes or no question.<br>
<br>
<b>2. Why am I NOT charging for 
this?</b> Probably because you had to give it away for free in the beginning to 
build momentum, credibility and word of mouth.<i>Which is perfectly acceptable.
</i> The challenge is making the transition, most of which derives from your 
sense of self-worth. You gotta believe in your product!<br>
<br>
<b>3. Should I 
be charging for this?</b> Yes, if it has value, if you&rsquo;re really good at 
it and if there&rsquo;s a market for it.<br>
<br>
<b>4. How much could I be 
charging for this?</b> <i>Dude, I don't know.</i> Depends on what you&rsquo;re 
worth per hour. Depends on how much work your new endeavor requires. Depends on 
how valuable your new &ldquo;thing&rdquo; is. Depends what the market will bear.
<br> <br>
<b>ASSET QUESTIONS</b> <br>
<b>1. What personal skills have I not 
tapped into yet to build my business?</b> Run an honest evaluation of what you 
bring to the table. Discover untapped assets and find a way to exploit them to 
grow your business.<br>
<br>
<b>2. What personal skills have I not tapped into 
yet to add value to my customers?</b> Exact same process as question #1, except 
this time you&rsquo;re exploiting them in the service of your customers.<br>

<br> <b>3. What products and services are my clients asking for that I 
don&rsquo;t currently provide?</b> Notice the patterns. Keep a running list. 
Spot the trends in customer&rsquo;s comments and figure out what that means for 
you.<br>
<br>
<b>4. Now that I have this, what else does this make possible?</b>
 The ultimate leverage question. Future focused. Exciting. Also a 
possibility-question that doubles or triples the value of an asset when you 
think about its future value.<br>
<br>
<b>5. Are you cloning yourself through 
teaching others?</b> Sheep? <i>Bah!</i> Clone yourself. <br>
<br>
<b>6. How can 
I give people a portable, junior, take-home, or alternate version of me?</b> 
Can&rsquo;t afford the speaking fee? Don&rsquo;t want to PAY the speaking fee? 
Don&rsquo;t have enough people to warrant an &ldquo;audience&rdquo; for a 
speech? No problem. Give clients different ways to &quot;get&quot; you. 
Different mediums. Different prices. Different YESES.<br>
<br>
<b>GROWTH 
QUESTIONS</b> <br>
<b>1. What&rsquo;s next?</b> Most important question of all 
time. Keeps you moving. Sidesteps entrepreneurial atrophy. Future focused, 
growth-minded<br>
<br>
<b>2. What&rsquo;s my sequel?</b> You don&rsquo;t want 
to be a one-hit wonder. You&rsquo;re contributing to a life-longbody of work. A 
library. A chronicle. Think Willie Nelson, not Don McLean.<br>
<br>
<b>3. What 
business COULD I be in?</b> The logical next step. The obvious fit. <br>
<br>

<b>4. When was the last time you created new value?</b> Hopefully, recently! Or 
are you just doing the same old stuff you did one year ago?<br>
<br>
<b>5. When 
was the last time you reinvented yourself?</b> Every few years, at least. A 
good parallel is to look at the music industry. Explore the timeline of a 
musician who&rsquo;s been around a LONG time and experienced multiple 
reinventions, still rocking all the while, i.e., Tom Waits or Van Morrison.<br>

<br> <b>6. At what point are you making a living vs. building your business?</b>
 This is when money takes a back seat to equity. When gross take a back seat to 
growth.<br>
<br>
<b>COMPETITION QUESTIONS</b> <br>
<b>1. Will it make your 
company more competitive?</b> If not, then what&rsquo;s the point of taking 
this endeavor on?<br>
<br>
<b>2. What would most scare or piss off the 
competition?</b> The answer to that question is what you should do. Something 
to make the competition think, &ldquo;Damn, that IS pretty cool. I wish 
we&rsquo;d thought of that first!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
<b>3. If I do this, will I 
become the best?</b> If not, bag it. Average is for losers. Especially in an 
age when the first hit on Google becomes the immediate front runner; it&rsquo;s 
just not worth doing anything unless you&rsquo;re going to become the best at 
it.<br>
<br>
<b>4. How can I change the rules so I can win at my own game?</b> 
The best way to eliminate the competition is to NOT have any. To become the 
ONLY. That Guy. The sole source.<br>
<br>
<b>5. Where are the uncontested 
waters, and how can I swim there?</b> Similarly, that means going where nobody 
else has the guts to go. That means becoming a category of one.<br>
<br>
<b>6. 
Is anybody else doing this now?</b> <i>If not, stuff it.</i> If so, ask 
yourself if you can do it better and cooler.<i>If you can't, stuff it.</i> If 
so, let&rsquo;s go!<br>
<br>
- - - <br>
<br>
REMEMBER: Successful entrepreneurs 
are like sharks &ndash; if they don&rsquo;t keep swimming, they die.<br>

<b>How to Build Your OWN Online Video Platform.</b> 
<br> <br>
<i>YouTube is for losers! Video isn&rsquo;t the future &mdash; 
it&rsquo;s the PRESENT!<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, because video is so ubiquitous 
and easy to do, the bar has been raised. And the concept of 'some guy in a room 
holding a camera,' isn&rsquo;t going to cut it anymore. You need to build your 
OWN video platform!<br>
<br>
Entrepreneurs MUST know how to leverage video to 
their advantage, not only to promote your business online, but for downloadable 
and hard-copy products.</i> <br>
<br>
In this program, you will learn how to: 
<br> <br>
* Leverage cultural trends, barriers and phenomena that stand in your 
way of boosting your fan base through online video<br>
<br>
* Get started 
without knowing what the hell you&rsquo;re doing<br>
<br>
* Master the timeline 
of video first impressions so your viewers don&rsquo;t tune you out<br>
<br>
* 
Find resources available to make the video learning curve non-existent<br>
<br>

* Use a multitude of channels to promote your online videos<br>
<br>
* Create 
online learning communities, message boards and other fan-building resources<br>
<br>* Use the most important question in entrepreneurship for your video 
platform<br>

<h2> The Caveman Principle&trade; </h2> Imagine you&rsquo;re a prehistoric 
hunter.<br>
<br>
Your mate is fast asleep in the cave. <br>
<br>
The sun is 
coming up.<br>
<br>
<i>It&rsquo;s time to kill breakfast!</i> <br>
<br>
Out in 
the prairie, you wait. Silent. Motionless. Anticipating even the slightest 
movement.<br>
<br>
Because you&rsquo;ve learned (in your experience as a 
prehistoric hunter) &hellip;<b>ANYTHING that moves is a threat to your survival.
</b> <br>
<br>
It could be a lion. <br>
It could be a woolly mammoth. <br>
It 
could be another hunter trying to steal your catch, or worse yet, clobber you.
<br> <br>
Either way, your Caveman Brain is conditioned in the following way: 
<br> <br>
<b>Movement? ---&gt; Change! ---&gt; Threat! ---&gt; Respond!</b> <br>
<br> <b>No movement? ---&gt; No change. ---&gt; No threat :) ---&gt; No 
response.</b> <br>
<br>
So, unchanging backgrounds get filtered out by your 
brain.<br>
Because familiar structures lead to mental laziness. <br>
Which 
means there&rsquo;s no need to pay attention.<br>
<br>
I call this <b>The 
Caveman Principle.</b> <br>
<br>
And although it originated a few million years 
ago, it&rsquo;s VERY interesting to note how this prehistoric survival trait 
manifests in our daily businesses activities.<br>
<br>
Especially when you 
realize that<i>The Caveman Principle</i> can actually make you more money. <br>

<br> <i>Mmm &hellip; good &hellip; Ug like money!</i> <br>
<br>
This brings to 
mind something I read in the (fantastic) book<i>Mindfulness</i>, by Dr. Ellen 
Langer:<br>
<br>
&ldquo;A familiar structure or rhythm helps lead to mental 
laziness, acting as a signal that there is no need to pay attention.&rdquo;<br>

<br> GREAT EXAMPLE: Ever Watch <i>The Simpsons?</i> <br>
<br>
Not only is <i>
The Simpsons</i> the basis for my entire personality. <br>
Not only is <i>The 
Simpsons</i> greatest show in the history of television. <br>
Not only is <i>
The Simpsons</i> longest running sitcom in the history of television. <br>
<br>

<i>The Simpsons</i> also happens to be the best example of <i>The Caveman 
Principle</i> in action. <br>
<br>
Think about it&hellip; <br>
<br>
During the 
opening credits to every episode of show, something always changes.<br>
<br>

(Actually, THREE things always change, every time.)<br>
<br>
Can you name them 
all?<br>
<br>
Well, if you&rsquo;re like me and you live your daily life is 
based on episodes of<i>The Simpsons</i>, this should be an easy question. <br>

<br>THE ANSWERS: <br>
<br>
1. Bart&rsquo;s detention chalkboard. <br>
2. The 
Simpson Family Couch.<br>
3. Lisa&rsquo;s saxophone solo. <br>
<br>
So, why is 
that important to your business?<br>
<br>
WELL, THINK ABOUT THIS: With the 
exception of<i>The Simpsons</i>, when was the last time YOU actually tuned in 
to watch the opening credits of your favorite show?<br>
<br>
<i>Never!</i> You 
just hit the fast forward button on your Tivo remote, zipped through the 
opening montage, skipped the subsequent commercials and started the show at 
seven minutes past the hour.<br>
<br>
See, the reason you never watch the 
opening credits of your favorite show is because they&rsquo;re always the same.
<br> <br>
<b>No movement? ---&gt; No change. ---&gt; No threat :) ---&gt; No 
response.</b> <br>
<br>
Completely predictable. <i>Ug was right.</i> <br>
<br>

But that&rsquo;s the genius of<i>The Simpsons</i>. By changing three distinct 
elements to their opening credit montage, they FORCE millions of people to tune 
in &ndash; and never miss &ndash;the very beginning of the every episode.<br>

<br> <b>Movement? ---&gt; Change! ---&gt; Threat! ---&gt; Respond!</b> <br>
<br>
Predictably unpredictable.<br>
<br>
And I&rsquo;m sure their advertisers just 
loooooooove that!<br>
<br>
NOTE: I'll be discussing <i>The Caveman Principle</i>
 in detail as it pertains toonline video platforms tomorrow night during my 
teleseminar forSpeaker Net News. <br>
<br>
<i>Mmm! Ug like teleseminar!</i> <br>

<h2> Get the hell out of the house! </h2> You&rsquo;re an artist. <br>
You 
work at home.<br>
You&rsquo;re self-employed. <br>
You have no coworkers. <br>

You attend very few meetings.<br>
You wear your pajamas all day. <br>
Your 
studio is your spare bedroom.<br>
Your work includes LOTS of solitude. <br>
You 
have clients, but you mainly interact with them via email or phone.<br>
<br>
<i>
Well then.</i> A job description like THAT can only mean one thing: <br>
<br>

<b>You need to get the HELL out of the house!</b> <br>
<br>
See, as a creative 
professional, getting out of the house and into the world is crucial component 
to supporting, enriching, inspiring and informing your art. Here&rsquo;s why:
<br> <br>
<b>o You get ideas.</b> From your observations, scannings and 
experiences. Then they get digested by your creative filter and get excreted 
onto your canvases. Raw material for your art is literally infinite &hellip; as 
long as you&rsquo;re willing to step out the front door.<br>
<br>
<b>o You 
share ideas.</b> To test them out. To solicit feedback. You let the world be 
your editor, adding to or subtracting from your ideas to make them better.<br>

<br> <b>o You round out ideas.</b> The people you interact with and the 
experiences you have add new dimensions to existing thoughts. After all, art 
never finishes! And, as your references grow richer and deeper, so does your 
art.<br>
<br>
<b>o You change your scenery.</b> This alters your patterns and 
routines. And regular &ldquo;breaking of set&rdquo; enables you to notice 
anomalies, experience changes and discern intricacies in the world, all of 
which fuel your art. And, if DON&rsquo;T do this, sitting in your living room 
all day gets real old real soon.<i>All work and no play makes Jackie a dull boy 
&hellip; All work and no play makes Jackie a dull boy &hellip; All work and no 
play makes&hellip;</i> <br>
<br>
<b>o You become more relatable.</b> Nobody can 
relate to art created in a vacuum. Especially in terms of research, since 
Google and YouTube can only teach you so much. See, there must be a spirit of 
humanness and ordinariness in your art; created by an artist who, himself, is 
human and ordinary because spends time with OTHER ordinary humans in ordinary 
places doing ordinary things. Without getting out of the house, you&rsquo;re 
just making shit up.<br>
<br>
So. Still wanna to sit at your desk in your 
pajamas all day?<br>
<br>
<i>Didn&rsquo;t think so.</i> <br>
<br>
In that case, 
here&rsquo;s a sampling of<i>Displacement Environments</i> to test out: <br>

<br> WHERE PEOPLE INTERACT: Yoga classes. Coffee shops. Malls. Churches. 
Temples. Intramural sports. Public beaches. Dog parks. Crowded cities. Or, a 
really terrible (yet fascinating) day job, waiting tables, selling furniture or 
parking cars.<br>
<br>
WHERE NATURE FLOURISHES: Botanical Gardens. Zoos. 
Mountains. Local Farmer&rsquo;s Markets. Creeks. Lakesides. Or, desolate spaces 
of solitude in the heart of nature&rsquo;s beauty.<br>
<br>
WHERE ART OOZES: 
Galleries. Flea markets. The Santa Monica Promenade. Theater districts. Schools 
(especially elementary). Music stores. Or, studios and workspaces of fellow 
artists, solo practitioners and Spare Room Tycoons.<br>
<br>
The choices are 
infinite!<br>
<br>
No matter where you live and work, Displacement Environments 
are ALWAYS at your disposal.<br>
<br>
So, as you test them out, remember these 
simple rules:<br>
<br>
<b>1. Make sure there are living things around.</b> 
People. Animals. Plants. Anything. They provide the energy, the light and the 
life force that fuel your creativity. They also tend to be more interesting 
than, say, buildings.<br>
<br>
<b>2. Go there regularly.</b> Not every day. And 
not according to an overly regimented schedule. Just commit to returning to a 
certain places consistently, and a variety of places occasionally. Over time, 
you&rsquo;ll make friends, become a regular, notice patterns and start to 
accumulate a rich mosaic of experiences and references.<br>
<br>
<b>3. Immerse 
yourself.</b> And when you&rsquo;re there, really BE there. Watching. 
Listening. Scanning. Observing. Allow the world to enter into your 
consciousness through your unique filter. After all, the goal IS to support, 
inform, inspire and enrich your creative practice!<br>
<br>
So, whether 
you&rsquo;re a writer, painter, consultant &ndash; or ANY type of Creative 
Professional, just remember these seven words:<br>
<br>
Get. The. Hell. Out. 
Of. The. House!<br>
<br>
Because REAL art can&rsquo;t be created in a vacuum. 
<br> <br>
LET ME ASK YA THIS... <br>
What informs your art? <br>

<h2> When does commitment become a detriment? </h2> People are often stunned 
when I tell them I&rsquo;ve actually forgotten to put on a nametag before.<br>

<br>&ldquo;No way! <i>You</i>!&rdquo; they gasp. <br>
<br>
&ldquo;Well, yeah. 
I&rsquo;m human,&rdquo; I explain.<br>
<br>
But it happens. Every once in a 
while I&rsquo;ll walk out my front door, or get into the car or be halfway to 
Starbucks when I look down at my shirt and say, &ldquo;Ah crap, I forgot my 
nametag.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Of course, keep in mind I always store ten spare 
pre-written nametags in my wallet just in case.<br>
<br>
So it&rsquo;s not like 
it&rsquo;s an unsolvable problem.<br>
<br>
<i>But, sure.</i> I forget to put on 
a nametag sometimes. Big deal.<br>
<br>
Now, on a larger scale, people are ALSO 
surprised when I give them my answer to the question, &ldquo;Scott, have you 
ever thought about QUITTING the whole nametag thing?&rsquo;<br>
<br>
Because <i>
obviously</i>, they assume my answer is an immediate, &ldquo;No!&rdquo; <br>

<br>When in fact, it&rsquo;s just the opposite. <br>
<br>
I&rsquo;ve absolutely 
thought about retiring the tag!<br>
<br>
And you know what? <br>
<br>
I 
don&rsquo;t mind admitting that to you. I&rsquo;m not ashamed that I&rsquo;ve 
doubted my own commitment.<br>
<br>
<b>Because I think there comes a point at 
which commitment can actually become a detriment.</b> <br>
<br>
AFTER ALL: What 
good is being committed if your commitment&hellip;<br>
<br>
<i>Becomes a threat 
to your health?<br>
Causes you to lose sight of your family?<br>
Harms the 
world or the people around you?</i> <br>
<br>
Or, more dangerously: What good 
is being committed if your commitment causes you to dishonor your Truth?<br>

<br>See, commitment can be seductive. <br>
<br>
Because sometimes, the deeper 
you commit to something, the more likely you are to become SO wrapped up and so 
obsessed with idea of BEING (and APPEARING) committed &hellip;<i>that your 
desire actually becomes bigger than that which you are committed to.</i> <br>

<br>And that&rsquo;s when you lose sight of what&rsquo;s truly important. <br>

<br>Even Mahatma Gandhi (of all people!) questioned his own commitment. Even HE 
occasionally had a change of heart.<br>
<br>
In one particular instance during 
a protest against the British in 1930, Gandhi suddenly decided to forfeit his 
public demonstration. And this was several days into it!<br>
<br>
So, when 
confronted by his lieutenants for an explanation, Gandhi said:<br>
<br>
<i>
&ldquo;Only God knows Absolute Truth; I just know relative truth. And my 
understanding of truth changes from day to day, so, I&rsquo;m sorry, but I need 
to stop this particular protest. My commitment must be to Truth, not to 
consistency.&rdquo;</i> <br>
<br>
What about you? <br>
<br>
Have you ever made 
a decision - just to appear consistent - while dishonoring your truth?<br>
<br>

NOTE: This isn&rsquo;t a case against commitment. Or consistency. <br>
<br>
<i>
I still believe that commitment is the secret of success.<br>
I still believe 
that consistency is far better than rare moments of greatness.</i> <br>
<br>

However, after 2,835 days, my experience leads me to believe there DOES come a 
point of diminishing returns.<br>
<br>
So, here&rsquo;s my advice: <br>
<br>
<b>
1. Don&rsquo;t allow psychological and social pressure to prevent you from 
making mistakes.<br>
<br>
2. Don&rsquo;t ignore that still, small voice in your 
intuitive heart.<br>
<br>
3. Constantly remind people of your commitment 
&hellip; BUT &hellip; let go of the need to do so for sole the purpose of 
strengthening your own position.</b> <br>
<br>
Look, when you notice a 
cognitive dissonance in your life, accept it &ndash; don&rsquo;t fight it.<br>

<br>Embrace your imperfect humanness! <br>
<br>
<i>You WILL have doubts. <br>

You WILL have misgivings.<br>
You WILL do things that are inconsistent with 
what you THOUGHT you believed.</i> <br>
<br>
BUT REMEMBER: Do not dishonor your 
Truth for the fear of appearing inconsistent.<br>
<br>
Which reminds me, I 
TOTALLY forgot to put on a nametag this morning.<br>
<br>
So if you&rsquo;ll 
excuse me, I need to go grab my Sharpie.<br>
<br>
LET ME ASK YA THIS... <br>

When was the last time you questioned your own commitment?<br>
<br>
LET ME 
SUGGEST THIS...<br>

Yourself,&quot; send an email to me, and I'll send you the list for free!<br>

<h2> Grow Creative Ears, Part 2 </h2> In the first post of this series, we 
explored a list of things, forces, people and situations to &ldquo;actively 
listen to&rdquo; so you could grow your creative practice.<br>
<br>
Next, 
let&rsquo;s work counter-intuitively. Here&rsquo;s a list of six things (NOT) 
to listen to for maximizing creative output:<br>
<br>
<b>1. Don&rsquo;t listen 
to that evil little devil of procrastination.</b> <br>
<i>Because resistance 
hath slain an endless list of would-be artists.</i> <br>
And in the words of 
Edison, &ldquo;I start where other men leave off.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
SO, THINK: 
Are you creating what wants to be created?<br>
<br>
<b>2. Don&rsquo;t listen to 
inspiration ONLY.</b> <br>
<i>Because it often comes unannounced.</i> <br>
And 
in the words of Tchaikovsky, &ldquo;A self-respecting artist must not fold his 
hands on the pretext that he is not in the mood. If we wait for the mood, 
without endeavoring to meet it halfway, we easily become indirect and 
apathetic.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
SO, THINK: Are you inspired or disciplined? <br>
<br>
<b>3. Don&rsquo;t listen to your conditioned mind.</b> <br>
<i>Because 
it&rsquo;s just telling your ego the story it wants to hear.</i> <br>
And in 
the words of Eckhart Tolle, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t ask your mind permission to 
enjoy what you do.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
SO, THINK: Are you letting your unconscious 
mind get in the way?<br>
<br>
<b>4. Don&rsquo;t listen to people who tell you 
to stop singing so loud.</b> <br>
<i>Because their imagination can&rsquo;t 
encompass what it is that you want to do.</i> <br>
And in the words of 
Neitzche, &ldquo;And those who were seen dancing were thought to be insane by 
those who couldn&rsquo;t hear the music.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
SO, THINK: Whom are 
you allowing to murder your creative nature?<br>
<br>
<b>5. Don&rsquo;t listen 
to what everyone else is doing.</b> <br>
<i>Because it&rsquo;s more fun to ask 
how YOU can do it, instead of asking how it&rsquo;s BEEN done.</i> <br>
And in 
the words of Napoleon Hill, &quot;Listen to the music that stirs in your 
heart.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
SO, THINK: How often does perfection keep you from 
starting?<br>
<br>
<b>6. Don&rsquo;t listen to self-appointed criticizers.</b> 
<br> <i>Because there&rsquo;s not a single museum in the word displaying a 
statue of a critic.</i> <br>
And in the words of James Hubbel, &ldquo;Art is 
learning how to be quiet.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
SO, THINK: How can you &ldquo;fight 
back with your art&rdquo; instead of getting defensive?<br>
<br>
LET ME ASK YA 
THIS...<br>
What do you (not) listen to? <br>
<br>
LET ME SUGGEST THIS... <br>

<h2> So, is this all you do? </h2> When you&rsquo;re passionately telling 
people about your art, certain individuals will attempt to steal the wind from 
your creative sails.<br>
<br>
They will ask you questions like: <br>
<br>

&ldquo;So, is art ALL you do?&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s your real 
job?&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;And art pays the bills?&rdquo; <br>
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s 
your other job?&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;And you make a living doing that?&rdquo; <br>

<br> <i>I know, I know.</i> It&rsquo;s frustrating, rude and assumptive AND 
blindly follows the starving artist script.<br>
<br>
But don&rsquo;t get upset. 
<br> <br>
REMEMBER: When people ask questions like that, it&rsquo;s often a 
projection of their artistic frustration and insecurity.<br>
<br>
See, when 
they see or hear about your art, their defense mechanism silently screams, 
&ldquo;But I couldn&rsquo;t make it an artist, so why should YOU?&rdquo;<br>

<br>They see something in you they either WISH they had, or DID have at one 
point, but lost.<br>
<br>
So, don&rsquo;t take it personally. <br>
<br>
<i>
It&rsquo;s got nothing to do with you.</i> <br>
<br>
You just keep doing your 
art.<br>
You just keep sharing you art. <br>
<br>
And let those chumps get real 
jobs.<br>
<br>
LET ME ASK YA THIS... <br>
Is this all you do? <br>
<br>
LET ME 
SUGGEST THIS...<br>

<br> <b>AVOID</b> <br>
<br>

don&rsquo;t listen very well.<br>
<br>
<b>Avoid comparison shoppers.</b> <br>

<br>
<b>Avoid 
eye rollers.</b> <br>
Because that&rsquo;s when people stop listening to you. 
<br> <br>
<b>Avoid fitting in.</b> <br>

remembered and get business.<br>
<br>
<b>Avoid hideous headlines.</b> <br>

<br>
<b>Avoid 
lumping indiscriminately.</b> <br>

compartmentalize every person you meet.<br>
<br>

<br>
<b>Avoid mental censoring.</b> <br>

Because you&rsquo;re burying some good stuff.<br>
<br>
<b>Avoid outdated 
frameworks.</b> <br>
Because they stop you from thinking. <br>
<br>
<b>Avoid 
self-satisfied contentment.</b> <br>
Because you&rsquo;ve never arrived and 
there ain&rsquo;t no finish line.<br>
<br>
<b>Avoid stale eyes.</b> <br>

Because they miss all of the nuances, anomalies and patterns that lead to 
breakthroughs.<br>
<br>
<b>Avoid stock phrases.</b> <br>
Because customers can 
TOTALLY tell.<br>
<br>
<b>Avoid telegraphing interest.</b> <br>

projects a needy, seeking attitude.<br>
<br>

What do 
you always avoid?<br>
