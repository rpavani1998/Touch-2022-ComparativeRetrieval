<h3>The Bottom Line</h3>  This <i>Simpsons</i> book contains very little 
prose, so it's very easy to enjoy, even for youngsters just learning to read. 
It's thin and made of durable, thick pages, so have no worries about traveling 
with this joke-filled gem. <br>

<h3>Pros</h3> 
<ul> 
<li>Gets to the jokes.</li> 
<li>Lots of pictures.</li> </ul> 
<h3>Cons</h3> 
<ul> 
<li>Wish it was longer.</li> </ul> 
<h3>Description</h3> 
<ul> 
<li>Available in hardcover and paperback.</li> 
<li>64 pages.</li> 
<li>Recommended for Grade 7 to Grade 9.</li> </ul> 
<h3>Guide Review - 'Simpsons' Uncensored Family Album'</h3> <i>The Simpsons 
Uncensored Family Album</i> offers fans pictures and anecdotes that they won't 
see on the show. The layout of the book is exactly like any family's photo 
album or scrapbook, complete with loose pictures that need to be pasted, 
scribbles, and embarrassing photos.
<p> The album starts with pictures of the Simpson family's ancestors, just 
like any other family album. The black and white photos reveal the somber 
expressions of Homer's relatives. Next, you can see pictures of a young Homer 
(with hair!), getting ready for prom or participating in school activies. Then 
the album reaches a more contemporary time. These pages display photos of baby 
Bart and baby Lisa, school papers, Patty and Selma, and other delightful family 
notes.</p> 
<p> The only negative comment I have is that the album left me wanting more. I 
wanted more pictures of the Simpson family in ways we don't see every Sunday 
night. But all good things must come to an end. And for the price, you can't 
beat it: I got a bellyache from laughing.</p> 
<p> Matt Groening, creator of <i>The Simpsons</i>, has authored other books, 
such as<i>Bart Simpson's Guide to Life</i>. He also founded Bongo Comics Group, 
which has produced comic books like<i>Simpsons Comics Strike Back</i> and <i>
Simpsons Comics Spectacular</i>. </p> 
<p> This family tell-all will delight any fan, newcomer to die-hard. Who can 
resist a naked baby Bart? Because it's not just a replica of episodes we've 
seen, it offers new laughs for everyone.</p> <br>
