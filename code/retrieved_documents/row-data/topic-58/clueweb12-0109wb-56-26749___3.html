The Simpsons: a family of Sephardic 
Jews? 
<p>The Simpsons Archive (www.snpp.com) has a strange but funny thesis that 
holds that the Simpsons are actually a family of Sephardic Jews:</p> 
<blockquote> The Sephardic Tradition encompasses the culture of the Jews who 
descended from Spain prior to the expulsion in 1492. However, a broader 
interpretation also includes Jews who originated from Turkey, Greece, Italy, 
England, the Ottoman Empire and other lands. The tradition today has come to 
include not only those with geographic ties, but also those with links to the 
fascinating culture. Many Jews know that Sephardim eat rice and beans on 
Pesach, and know of the unique torah trope of the tradition, but little else. 
However, many Jews, and even non-Jews are exposed to aspects of the Sephardic 
tradition and culture without even knowing it. [...] 
<p>According to David Gitlitz, in spite of the attempts of crypto Jews, most 
of these conversos had been completely assimilated by the end of the 17th 
century (Gitlitz x). Gitlitz say that the meager remnants that resurfaced in 
the 20th century are the exception to the rule. There is evidence to suggest 
that the writers portray the Simpson family as crypto Jews of the assimilated 
nature, so much so that they no longer know their true identity. Mark Pinsky, 
author of The Gospel According To The Simpsons, argues that &quot;The Simpsons 
from time to time suggest an underlying element of what might be called 
crypto-Judaism&quot; (121). For example, a menorah is found in the Simpsons' 
storage closet, with no explanation. Also, Homer's father Abe, is portrayed as 
the quintessential Jewish grandfather, always complaining and boring his family 
with stories of &quot;the old country.&quot;</p> </blockquote> 
<p></p> 
<p>Many of my good friends in Israel are Sephardic Jews whose parents came 
from Moroco, Tunisia and Algeria. Man, I love that couscous.</p> 
<p>I copy the full thesis below, it's long but worht it, and the real story is 
an overview of Sephardic history and culture.<br>

<p>Sephardic Tradition and &quot;The Simpsons&quot; Connections<br>

<p>The Sephardic Tradition encompasses the culture of the Jews who descended 
from Spain prior to the expulsion in 1492. However, a broader interpretation 
also includes Jews who originated from Turkey, Greece, Italy, England, the 
Ottoman Empire and other lands. The tradition today has come to include not 
only those with geographic ties, but also those with links to the fascinating 
culture. Many Jews know that Sephardim eat rice and beans on Pesach, and know 
of the unique torah trope of the tradition, but little else. However, many 
Jews, and even non-Jews are exposed to aspects of the Sephardic tradition and 
culture without even knowing it.</p> 
<p>Ever since the late 1950's, America has been fascinated by pop culture. 
From Andy Warhol's eccentric artwork to Britney Spears, pop culture has 
reflected the times and ideas of generations past in a convenient, easy to 
understand fashion. Today, pop culture can be found in the form of the 
Internet, radio, movies, or television. While their methods are extremely 
efficient, only television is able to offer a visual as well as audio component 
that is free and easy to access. Often pop culture is criticized because it 
lacks intelligence and stereotypically portrays much of society, but this does 
not hold true for all facets of pop culture. For example, &quot;The 
Simpsons,&quot; the longest running primetime animated show, has often been 
praised for being one of the most intelligent and provocative television 
programs on the air. Although many discount &quot;The Simpsons,&quot; simply 
because it is a cartoon, this portion of the population is blinded to the high 
&quot;plane&quot; the show operates on. Aside to references to famous authors 
and philosophers like Marx, Kant, Twain, and Hemingway, &quot;The 
Simpsons&quot; also displays a knowledge of the Sephardic tradition that would 
make Rabbi Moses ben Maimon blush.</p> 
<p>The creators of &quot;The Simpsons&quot; know that they have a powerful 
effect on their audience and have the opportunity to impart some wisdom onto 
their faithful cadre of fans. Much of this knowledge comes from the teachings 
of the Jewish faith. Long time writer Mike Reiss says, &quot;There have always 
been a lot of Jewish writers on 'The Simpsons&quot; (Pinsky 109). For example, 
self-proclaimed Sephardic Jew Hank Azaria not only writes for the show but also 
lends his voice to numerous characters such as Apu, Professor Frink, and Moe. 
Writers like Azaria have deftly incorporated Jewish wisdom into various 
episodes, much of which includes aspects of the Sephardic tradition.</p> 
<p>The Simpson family, which the show places into various situations each 
episode has a broad range of personality traits in each of the characters. 
First off, there is the father Homer, who has a deep passion for life, as well 
as food. His judgment is often poor, but he usually means well, especially in 
regards to his family. His wife Marge has large blue hair, and holds the family 
together through her unending dedication to her job as a homemaker. They have 
three children: Bart is the young troublemaker who always causes a ruckus, 
while Lisa represents high intellectualism and morals, even though she is only 
eight years old. The baby Maggie never speaks, but observes all the ordeals the 
family goes through. The Simpsons live in Springfield, a diverse town that is 
the setting for the series. The use of the town and recurring characters in 
each episode creates a virtual community, with people of all races, classes, 
religions and traditions. However, this diverse setting often leads to culture 
wars and clashes between the townspeople.</p> 
<p>All too often in world history, when nations experience internal strife, 
leaders are quick to blame a distinguishable group for the problems. The 
Spanish Inquisition was instituted to rid the country of individuals whom they 
believed to be causing Spain's rapid decline. In fact, Spain was losing many of 
its colonies throughout the world, achieving a smaller sphere of influence, and 
its source of wealth was drying up. The gold and silver they counted on from 
foreign lands ran out, and the country entered difficult economic times. 
&quot;The Jew became the scapegoat of all misfortune, economic or 
otherwise&quot; (Mowbray). The events of the inquisition forever changed the 
traditions and roles of Sephardic Jews. No longer was there a Golden Age, where 
Jewish thought and life flourished. Instead, Jews felt unwelcome and were 
persecuted because of their identity. The effects of Jews being used as 
scapegoats for societal problems can be seen today in the Sephardic tradition. 
Lessons from this can be learned, with the hope that something of this nature 
will not happen again.</p> 
<p>The horror and shear unfairness of the expulsion of Jews from Spain was 
demonstrated in a 1996 episode of &quot;The Simpsons.&quot; The details of the 
show have a striking resemblance to the situation Jews encountered during the 
Spanish Inquisition. In the episode &quot;Much Apu About Nothing,&quot; 
citizens of Springfield are unhappy with the high rate of taxes, and the 
government leader, Mayor Quimby, blames the economic problem on illegal 
immigrants. This is a sharp parallel to the Inquisition, during which the 
government leaders, King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella, blamed the troubles of 
Spain, including economic problems, on the Jews. In the case of this 
&quot;Simpsons&quot; episode, while in fact immigrants had nothing to do with 
the tax increase, they were used as defenseless, powerless scapegoats, much 
like the Jews during the Inquisition.</p> 
<p>Many Jews in Spain found their lives became easier once they converted to 
Christianity. The term &quot;Crypto Jew&quot; refers to a person secretly 
remaining faithful to Judaism while outwardly practicing another religion. In 
addition to the &quot;marranos&quot; of Spain and Portugal, crypto Jews also 
existed in North Africa in the 12th century. While they were officially deemed 
&quot;New Christians&quot; and were supposed to be treated as equals, 
considerable legislation was taken against them in Spain, Portugal, and the 
colonies. In addition, the brunt of the Spanish Inquisition was aimed at them 
(Sephardim 1146). There were considerable amounts of social, political, and 
economic pressures placed on Jews in Spain to convert once the 14th century 
rolled around (Gitlitz 4). For example, in 1348, Castillian Jews were forbidden 
to lend money at interest (Gilitiz 6). And as early as the mid 13th century, 
Christians were allowed to enter temples and attempt to persuade Jews to 
convert as they were forced to sit and listen. In 1263, Saint Raymond of 
Penyafort and Nacmanides were forced to debate the reliability of the Talmud 
before a congregation in Barcelona (Gitlitz 4). Although no outcome was 
reached, a bad precedent had been set. In the 1370's, a revival of anti-Semitic 
literature took place in Spain and several prominent Jews converted, including 
Solomon Halevi, chief Rabbi of Burges, who took the name of Pablo de Santa 
Maria. Fueled by the inflammatory oratory of Archdeacon Martinez of Seville, 
who preached a holy war against the Jews, and called for the destruction of 
local synagogues, pogroms spread across Spain in June of 1391, followed by mass 
conversions. Haim Beinart said &quot;what started in Seville in 1391 was like a 
spark in a forest fire&quot; (425). Once lit, nobody could quell the 
anti-Semitism in Spain.</p> 
<p>It was estimated that one third of the Jewish population of Spain was 
killed in the pogroms of 1391, and another third converted to Christianity 
(Beinart 425). Jews faced more and more hardships in Spain after this incident, 
culminating in the Edict of Expulsion of 1492, which forced Jews to either 
convert of leave the country. These extremely difficult circumstances forced a 
significant percentage of Jews to take on the Christian faith.</p> 
<p>Conversos came in two categories: those who wished to mend into Christian 
society and erase their Jewish past and those who sought to preserve as much of 
their heritage with as few alterations as possible. This latter form is what is 
now almost romantically referred to as the crypto Jew. Some noteworthy changes 
include the shift from yeshiva education to being taught by one's family 
members, an obligation taken very seriously (Gitlitz 217).</p> 
<p>If anyone truly understands the difficulties of living one way, and 
believing something completely different, it is &quot;Simpsons&quot; character 
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon (voiced by Azaria). Apu was born in Ramatur, Pakistan 
and attended Calcutta Technical Institute (CalTech) where he graduated 
valedictorian of his class of seven million. After several years, he completed 
his Ph.D. thesis and then found work at Springfield's Kwik-E-Mart (a spoof of 
7-11 convenience stores). Apu is a devout Hindu, but has been forced to hide 
his religious identity in order to be accepted by his peers. He adorns a cowboy 
hat to cover up his traditional Indian locks and at times even tried to feign 
interest in baseball, America's national pastime. When Apu replaces his statue 
of the Hindu god Genisha with a stack on Entertainment Weekly magazines, Homer 
asks why Apu made the change, to which he responds &quot;Oh, who needs the 
infinite compassion of Genisha when I have Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman staring 
at me with their dead eyes!&quot; The obvious frustration felt by Apu here is 
typical of what many crypto Jews felt in Spain. Apu curses himself for letting 
down his family, &quot;I've betrayed my Indian heritage, sir. What would my 
parents say?&quot; This must have been a feeling that many crypto Jews were 
forced to get used to in order to remain in Spain.</p> 
<p>The same can be said of the life of the character Waylon Smithers. Smithers 
is a closet homosexual, and is forced to forever hide this aspect of his life 
from his peers to gain their acceptance. He carries a picture of his boss Mr. 
Burns, with whom he is infatuated, in his wallet alongside his dog. He even has 
dreams of Mr. Burns flying into bed with him. Yet every opportunity he has to 
declare his true self, Smithers reluctantly holds back. In the episode entitled 
&quot;Bart's Inner Child,&quot; Smithers actually musters up the courage to 
tell Mr. Burns that he loves him at the first &quot;Do What You Feel 
Festival,&quot; but quickly covers his tracks by adding &quot;&#133; in those 
colors!&quot; This idea of hiding one's true identity is very much related to 
the Sephardic crypto tradition, and brought up repeatedly in &quot;The 
Simpsons.&quot;</p> 
<p>According to David Gitlitz, in spite of the attempts of crypto Jews, most 
of these conversos had been completely assimilated by the end of the 17th 
century (Gitlitz x). Gitlitz say that the meager remnants that resurfaced in 
the 20th century are the exception to the rule. There is evidence to suggest 
that the writers portray the Simpson family as crypto Jews of the assimilated 
nature, so much so that they no longer know their true identity. Mark Pinsky, 
author ofThe Gospel According To The Simpsons, argues that &quot;The Simpsons 
from time to time suggest an underlying element of what might be called 
crypto-Judaism&quot; (121). For example, a menorah is found in the Simpsons' 
storage closet, with no explanation. Also, Homer's father Abe, is portrayed as 
the quintessential Jewish grandfather, always complaining and boring his family 
with stories of &quot;the old country.&quot;</p> 
<p>In addition to crypto-Jewry, the Sephardic tradition is based heavily on 
enjoying life and taking care of oneself while doing so. For example, poems by 
Sephardic writers such as Moses ibn Ezra convey the importance of living life 
to its fullest. &quot;Immerse your heart in pleasure and in joy,&quot; he 
writes. Another poem by Rufina Bernardetti, a Sephardic-American, expresses the 
importance of living with a vivacious spirit in Sephardic culture. &quot;With 
the wholeness of spirit that is victorious we once more can share the essence 
and purity of life as Jews from Sepharad&quot;. These writings begin to 
encompass what the Sephardic tradition means in today's world.</p> 
<p>&quot;The Simpsons&quot; demonstrate the concept of living life to its 
fullest routinely, especially through Homer's actions. While simply a working 
class family man, over the years Homer has managed to accomplish many things 
including winning a Grammy award, traveling to outer space, climbing the 
highest mountain in town, doing undercover work for the police, and meeting 
Presidents Ford, Carter, Bush, and Clinton. He has a sensational passion for 
life. &quot;I want it all! The terrifying lows, the dizzying highs, the creamy 
middles&quot; (Irwin 7). Homer's ambition and thirst for excitement allows him 
to live a fulfilling life, which other characters take pride in. His next-door 
neighbor, Ned Flanders, labels Homer as having an &quot;intoxicating lust for 
life&quot; (Irwin 20).</p> 
<p>While Homer does many life-rewarding things, he also does many things that 
go against the Sephardic tradition. All too often he contradicts the teachings 
of Maimonides and other Sephardic thinkers, which leads to visible negative 
effects. He has a hedonistic lifestyle, which is the flaw that prevents him 
from greatness. In the episode &quot;Wild Barts Can't Be Broken,&quot; Homer's 
favorite baseball team wins the pennant, and he celebrates with heavy drinking, 
which leads him to destroy the local school. Homer enjoyed drink, as ibn Ezra's 
poem dictates, but he did so to the point of excess where Maimonides would not 
be pleased with his actions. &quot;Food should not be taken to repletion,&quot; 
he says (Minkin 382). Homer also eats to excess on many other occasions, which 
causes him physical harm, and creates problems for himself and his family. In 
order to qualify for disability and be able to work from home, Homer 
intentionally eats to gain weight His plan backfires, and he loses the respect 
of his family and friends when he does damage to his body. Other examples of 
Homer's hedonism are demonstrated by his eating to the point of sickness. After 
eating expired canned meat, Homer returns to the store to complain, where he is 
quick to accept ten pounds of moldy seafood as an apology, which only makes him 
sicker. In yet again another situation, Homer eats a steak so large that 
another person who he coerces into eating it with him has a heart attack. 
Obviously, Homer in this case did not follow Maimonides' instructions to eat 
one-third less than the quantity that would make one feel full (Minkin 382).</p>
<p>Maimonides also incorporates his advice about other topics of health and 
hygiene into the Sephardic tradition. When giving the rules for proper rest and 
sleeping, he insists, &quot;one should not sleep during the day&quot; (Minkin 
383). Meanwhile, Homer is routinely shown asleep on the job throughout the day. 
While this goes against what Maimonides taught, at the same time, these actions 
are fulfilling and gratifying to his lifestyle, which is encouraged by the 
tradition. Homer's characteristics and actions have been assimilated into 
American culture, while containing Sephardic themes and traditions, unbeknownst 
to many.</p> 
<p>Good health is a prerequisite for another important part of the Sephardic 
tradition: education. According to Maimonides, the highest goal that one can 
hope to attain is the perfection of the mind. As he noted in The Guide to the 
Perplexed, &quot;the true perfection of man [is] the possession of the highest 
intellectual faculties&quot; (Minkin 417). For Maimonides, the ultimate aim of 
education was to achieve knowledge of G-d through the Torah, but he and his 
Sephardic peers never underestimated the importance of learning in other areas. 
This stress on education of secular subjects as well as religious topics 
allowed the Sephardic Jews privileged enough to live in the Golden Age of Spain 
to contribute to a wide array of matters. According to Solomon David Sassoon, 
&quot;all fields of intellectual endeavor such as medicine, mathematics, 
philosophy, grammar, poetry, ethics Talmud and mysticism&#133;were widely 
deepened by the Jews of Spain&quot; (Sassoon 7).</p> 
<p>Aspects of the Sephardic style of education can be seen clearly in 
&quot;The Simpsons&quot; upon careful inspection. According to Maimonides, 
every province is responsible for the education of its youth, and the penalty 
of neglecting this duty is excommunication (Minkin 286). This responsibility is 
undertaken by the people of Springfield in the episode titled &quot;The PTA 
Disbands&quot; (Richmond 172). When Principal Skinner is forced to cut back 
funding for school supplies and teachers' salaries, the teachers decide to call 
a strike. Instead of panicking and having children run wild through the 
streets, members of the community step forward and take the teachers' place 
until an agreement can be met. The eccentric Professor Frink (also voiced by 
Azaria) teaches his nursery school class the physics behind many of their 
beloved toys and Marge Simpson lectures to Bart's class on geography.</p> 
<p>&quot;The Simpsons&quot; often utilizes the technique known as irony to 
illustrate a particular message. In short, by showing one thing, the writers 
hope to preach the very opposite. This is the case with the teachers of 
Springfield Elementary School. They show the teachers in a certain light, and 
because the viewer ridicules this presentation, they tend to agree with the 
opposite. Maimonides preaches for teachers to have patience with their 
disciples, as he said &quot;If the teacher taught and his pupil did not 
understand he should not be angry with them or fall into a rage, but should 
repeat the lesson again and again till they have grasped the full meaning&quot; 
(Minkin 288). In &quot;Summer of 4 ft. 2,&quot; Mrs. Hoover, a second grade 
teacher, is speaking about the Abraham Lincoln assassination when she finds 
that she is under time pressure. When one of her students is perplexed about 
the situation and asks, &quot;Was president Lincoln ok?&quot; Hoover angrily 
and sarcastically remarks that President Lincoln was fine, in order to leave 
sooner. The writers behind &quot;The Simpsons&quot; are preaching that a 
certain degree of patience is necessary for a teacher to be effective, in 
agreement with Maimonides. Another example of this frustration expressed openly 
by faculty members of Springfield Elementary occurs when Principal Skinner 
blurts out &quot;You and I both know these children have no future!&quot; to a 
lunchroom filled with students (Richmond 172). Neither Maimonides nor any 
self-respecting Sephardic teacher would ever approve of such outrageous display.
</p> 
<p>Maimonides also states that a pupil should have a great deal of respect for 
his teacher, as he wrote &quot;he is under obligation to honor and revere his 
teacher, even to a greater extent than to his father; for his father gave him 
life in this world, while his teacher who instructs wisdom, secures for him 
life in the world to come.&quot; (Minkin 289). Bart Simpson, who can be seen as 
the yetzer ha-ra personified, shows no respect for his teachers, and thus 
damages his ability to learn. In the episode entitled &quot;Itchy and Scratchy: 
The Movie,&quot; we learn that Bart once replaced his teacher's birth control 
pills with tic-tacs, and in &quot;Bart The Lover&quot; he forged love letters 
to her. Bart spends most of his time getting into mischief rather than 
studying. This could be perhaps traced back to his lack of respect for his 
teacher. Bart consistently gets bad grades, dreads school, and has no desire to 
learn. These are the dangers that Maimonides was warning about when the proper 
method of education is not implemented.</p> 
<p>A typical curriculum for a Jewish boy in 13th century Spain was divided 
into three sections, the first being bible and Talmud, the second being ethical 
and philosophical works, and the third being scientific studies such as logic, 
astronomy, physics and metaphysics and mathematics (Sassoon 8-9). These diverse 
topics of study helped Sephardic Jews grow up to be great thinkers. 
Unfortunately, the students at Springfield Elementary don't have the same 
luxuries. All of the writers on &quot;The Simpsons&quot; have gone to great 
undergraduate and graduate universities, over 21 of who hail from Harvard, and 
thus know the importance of a diverse education. This is displayed by showing 
the opposite of the ideal at Bart and Lisa's school. For example, they only 
books the school can afford are ones banned by other schools like, Tek War and 
The Satanic Verses. The fourth grade teacher Ms. Edna Krabappel and Principal 
Seymour Skinner also take little care in finding diverse material to teach 
their pupils. Instead, in &quot;Grade School Confidential,&quot; Skinner admits 
that he loves working at an elementary school because &quot;The children will 
believe anything you tell them.&quot;</p> 
<p>The hope of the Sephardic community in providing a diverse education was to 
mold an adult who was adept at many things. The term often used today for such 
a person is &quot;Renaissance man,&quot; but aside from people like Leonardo da 
Vinci who had exceptional talents in a range of fields, many Sephardic Jews 
also fit this category. This Sephardic versatility is now indicative of the 
tradition. For example, many great Rabbis were also physicians, such as 
Maimonides, Nachmanides, and Rabbenu Nissim ben Reuben. Others were 
statesman-scholars, such as Isaac Abravanel, who was Ferdinand and Isabella's 
treasurer as well as the author of some very popular biblical commentary 
(Sassoon 23). In addition, many Sephardic poets were also well known in other 
spheres, such as Samuel ha-Nagid, who was a commander in the military, grand 
vizier to Grenada, grocery store owner, and halachist.</p> 
<p>This Sephardic tradition is kept alive in Lisa Simpson, the brilliant and 
talented middle child of the Simpson family. Many of the members of the 
Springfield community have questionable morals and talents, but not Lisa. She 
is far and away the most respectable character. &quot;Lisa, is not only 
pro-intellectual, she is smart beyond her years. She is extremely intelligent 
and sophisticated, and is often seen out-thinking those around her.&quot; 
(Irwin 26). Aside, from her immense knowledge of history, mathematics, and the 
sciences, Lisa is also an accomplished musician. She plays the saxophone for 
her school band, and also plays the bass, bongo drums, didgeridoo and acoustic 
guitar. In addition, she is a skillful horse back rider and at one time took 
care of a pony of her own. Lisa is also politically active. In &quot;Mr. Lisa 
Goes to Washington,&quot; she exposes a corrupt congressman for taking bribes 
(Richmond 63). Lisa is a devoted feminist. In &quot;Lisa vs. Malibu 
Stacy,&quot; she creates a doll of her own for little girls to respect as 
opposed to the popular &quot;Barbie&quot; like Malibu Stacy, which is nothing 
more then a chauvinistic male stereotype. Finally, Lisa is a devoted sister and 
daughter who loves her family very much, and while she may be the classic 
&quot;overachiever,&quot; she nevertheless remains the model of Sephardic 
versatility.</p> 
<p>Even though many of the traditions of Sephardic culture were created 
generations ago, it still lives on today. The Sephardic tradition has come a 
long way from the days of the Inquisition, where people had to hide their 
roots, to today's modern culture, where it is ubiquitous. Nowadays, one of the 
country's most popular television shows overtly displays numerous facets of 
Sephardic culture. &quot;The Simpsons&quot; has an audience that ranges from 
young children to adults, and affects viewers on many levels. Countless viewers 
take what they see on the show and make it part of their lifestyle, which 
invigorates Sephardic thoughts and teachings into society. In this case, life 
is truly imitating art.</p>

<p>I really enjoyed reading this paper and I think the points it raise are 
unique and have alot of validity to it. Aren't many of the Simpsons writers 
Jewish?</p> 
<p>Posted by: Aaron Stein at January 11, 2003 01:49 PM</p> 
<p>This is a retarded article yes many of the creators of the Simpsons are 
Judaic but the characters, The Simpsons are clearly Protestant Christians, but 
I am sure your going to call the murranos, crypto jew, anusims, but I've 
already thought ahead of you on that one buster, the murranos were people who 
were outwardly Catholic but practiced Judaism in secret. The Simpsons are 
clearly Anglo-Saxon Protestants not Spanish Jewry.</p>
