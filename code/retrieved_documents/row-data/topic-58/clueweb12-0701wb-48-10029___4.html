<h2>Ratings: In The Name Of The Grandfather</h2> 
<p>A total of <strong>6.15 million</strong> viewers tuned in to watch In The 
Name Of The Grandfather last night, despite its availability on the net all 
week due to an exclusive screening in the UK/Ireland. The figures aren&rsquo;t 
excellent, but these days we&rsquo;re just happy it hasn&rsquo;t set a new 
record low. The episode attracted<strong>511,000 viewers</strong> on Sky 1 in 
Ireland earlier this week, more than doubling Sky 1&prime;s previous highest 
audience for any program in Ireland. A further<strong> 957,000</strong> watched 
the episode in the UK. These international figures, of course, are not included 
in the North American ratings.</p> 
<p>Fox was fourth overall for the night, and third among adults 18-49. King Of 
The Hill had 5.49 million viewers, Family Guy had 7.45 million, and American 
Dad had 5.85 million.</p>

<p>yay! ratings are getting higher, its not perfect but good that they are 
improving. I watched it on sky and the uk are getting good ratings for the 
simpsons seeing that its muuuuuuuuuuuuch smaller then the US.</p> Reply <br>

<p>Yay, yay for ratings, it&rsquo;s weird that for the UK just under 1 million 
viewers is great ratings for Sky. I&rsquo;m glad it did well as I thouroughly 
enjoyed this episode </p> Reply <br>

<p>This is really great news for the show! <br>
 This only proves that a got 
episodes give high ratings!</p> 
<p>I hope that next episode will bring more that 6.5 millions, and it&rsquo;s 
also great that there is a big number of UK viewers, but it is probably only 
this time because the plot of this episode was in Ireland&hellip;</p> Reply <br>

<p>The Simpsons definitely should have gotten higher ratings than this. At 
least the ratings are higher than last weeks. Lets hope that the ratings 
continue to get higher. Family Guy sucked yesterday. I only watched part of the 
episode to see why they were getting higher ratings than the Simpsons. I have 
no Idea why. I used to like Family Guy, but it has lost it&rsquo;s edge. I 
wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if Family Guy got canceled any time soon.</p> Reply

<p>It&rsquo;s too bad the ratings are not very high. I thought &ldquo;In the 
Name of the Grandfather&rdquo; was by far the best of the HD episodes so far.

<p>I&rsquo;ll be the first to admit: this was better than I thought it was 
gonna be!<br>
 Maybe the show&rsquo;s getting better?!?!<br>
 Or, &ldquo;Family 
Guy&rdquo; &amp; &ldquo;American Dad&rdquo; are getting CRAPPIER!</p> Reply <br>
