2009, 09:04:04 AM &raquo;  I can agree that simpsons was amazingly hilarious 
aswell <br>
<br>
I don't know, i'm just more to family guy. <br>
Their humor 
just caught me, probably because i have the lamest humor in the world :S<br>

2009, 07:54:55 PM &raquo;  if you like family guy you'll like american dad, 
same level of humor<br>
if you like the simpsons most likely you'll like 
futurama, same level again..  Logged <br>

2009, 08:32:55 AM &raquo;  I always loved Family Guy especially Mayor Adam 
West, some of his quotes really made me laugh. Just a little confused though, 
since they started the new &quot;The Cleveland show&quot; where Cleveland (ofc) 
has gotten his own show now, are they gonna continue having him in Family guy?

2009, 04:05:31 PM &raquo;  Nah he's gone, the crew is going to need a new 
replacement(most likely will be Mort).<br>
He did make an appearance in the 
last episode though when they broke his tub again, so I'm sure we'll see him 
again once in a while.  Logged <br>

07, 2009, 07:26:41 PM &raquo;  I like Family Guy for not being too preachy and 
really using their voice acting to the ultimate level possible, as well as 
being the most creative show ever.&nbsp; The Simpsons have become somewhat 
formulaic like most sitcoms end up being... I.E. you can basically expect the 
ending of each episode.&nbsp; Not that Family Guy doesn't do the same thing 
from time to time, but they do know how to mock reality better than any show 
ever.<br>
<br>
American Dad is just a sister show of Family Guy (same 
creator/writer)<br>
<br>
Futurama is just a sister show of Simpsons (same 
creator/writer)<br>
<br>
I wish The Cleveland Show would drop the huge bear... 
does he even have moments where he just unexpectedly mauls someone to death, or 
does he just whine about everything?  Logged <br>
