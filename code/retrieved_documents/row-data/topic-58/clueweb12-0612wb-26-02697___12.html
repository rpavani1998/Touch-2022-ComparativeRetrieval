New Voices in Latin America?<br>
<i>By Nicol&aacute;s Di Candia 
(nicolas@snpp.com) -<b>January 14, 2005</b></i><br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; 
&nbsp;Simpsons viewers in Latin America may get a very different show when 
season 16 premieres. On January 8th news media all over the region began to 
report that the voices of Homer (done by Humberto Velez, see photo), Marge 
(Nancy McKenzy), Bart (Claudia Mota), Lisa (Patricia Acevedo) and Mr. Burns 
(Gabriel Ch&aacute;vez) would change beginning with next season. This was due 
to a conflict between the company that dubs the show into Spanish and the 
Mexican actors' union. The show is dubbed in Mexico City.<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; 
&nbsp;However, the reality seems a bit less drastic. The company, called 
Grabaciones y Doblajes Internacionales, is negotiating a new contract with the 
union, called Asociaci&oacute;n Nacional de Actores, or ANDA. The core of the 
conflict seems to be that the ANDA wants the company to commit to hiring only 
ANDA members, and the company refuses to agree. This was the policy before, 
when the show was dubbed by two different production houses that are no longer 
in business.<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The company says that, as it is new, it 
doesn't have to renew a contract it didn't sign in the first place. To which 
the union responds that there are common shareholders between GDI and one of 
the previous companies, so it's not a completely new company.<br>
 &nbsp; 
&nbsp; &nbsp;Of course, not having to hire union actors means lower costs for 
the company. The negotiation is ongoing and arguments keep going back and 
forth.. As such, it's hard to discern truth from fiction when reading press 
statements made by the parties involved.<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Actor 
Humberto Velez, who directs the dubbing on The Simpsons and plays Homer (called 
Homero), first talked about this as a done deal, and was limited to say how 
sorry he was that it happened. Now he's saying what the demands are and is 
believed to be taking part in the union negotiations. It's becoming quite 
evident that the press statements are part of both parties' negotiation 
strategies. It needs to be made clear that this is not a salary conflict, and 
it's not a conflict involving the Simpsons actors directly. It's strictly an 
union conflict.<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;If no settlement is reached, one of 
the following will happen:</p>  The Simpsons (and some other shows) will have 
new voices. If the situation stays like today, chances are this will happen. <b>
OR</b>  20th Century Fox will have to change the company where the dubbing is 
made. <b>OR</b>  The actors will have to leave the union to keep that gig. This 
means that they would not be able to work for any company which has a contract 
with the union. And, as freelancers, they would lose a big portion of their 
work.<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The position of 20th Century Fox in this 
conflict is unclear. The actors have said the corporation is on their side, but 
their public statements come of noncommital: &quot;We hope a settlement can be 
reached&quot;.<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;20th Century Fox pays for the dubbing. 
The actors have said that each episode cost 1,000 US dollars to be dubbed, and 
each actor gets $60 an episode (the actors say they are not asking for raises). 
Compared to that, the salaries of the original voices, $250,000 an episode, 
seem astronomical. And while there is a huge difference, it should be noted 
that they do very different jobs, in very different conditions and in very 
different markets.<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Though we don't know if there's a 
connection, it's worth to point out that months after the first conflict with 
the original actors of The Simpsons, the Latin American voice of Bart was 
changed and has not been changed back. The switch was the result of a salary 
dispute with actress Marina Huerta.<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This incident 
applies to the Spanish version of The Simpsons seen in all Latin America. It 
does not apply to Spain, where a different Spanish version is made.<br>

situation, visitSimpsons en Argentina  , the CASFO forum (both in Spanish) or 
theNo Homers Club (in English). <br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>Update</b> 
(February 25, 2005) - The voices went on strike yesterday. The actors picketed 
the offices of the company, Grabaciones y Doblajes Internationales, blocking 
entry to the non-union actors, BBCreports. <br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>Update
</b> (April 3, 2005) - It has been confirmed that the main voices of the show 
in Latin America will be replaced. Canal Fox will air the 16th season, probably 
starting in June, with the new voices.<br>

Complete Fifth Season Reviewed<br>
<i>By Wesley Mead 
(wesley@snpp.com) -<b>January 1, 2005</b></i><br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;<i>
The Complete Fifth Season</i>&quot; DVD set, featuring all 22 episodes from the 
series'fifth season (1993-1994), was released in the USA and Canada on December 
21st, 2004. It will be released in other countries around the globe throughout 
the first half of 2005.<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This quick release was a 
pleasant surprise for fans who were expecting to have to wait a year but got 
away this time around with a mere six months. Many would argue season five of 
the show is a slightly weaker season than season 4, just prior to it, and 
whilst that may be true - certain episodes seemed to rely more upon wacky 
outrageous gags than strong satire and well-written wit - there's no denying 
this season contained several of the greatest episodes ever, and every 
23-minute animated masterpiece here will satisfy a fan's appetite for the show. 
All-time greats &quot;<i>Homer's Barbershop Quartet</i>&quot;, &quot;<i>Cape 
Feare</i>&quot; and &quot;<i>Deep Space Homer</i>&quot;, are present and 
correct, alongside other favourites like &quot;<i>Treehouse Of Horror IV</i>
&quot;, &quot;<i>Bart Gets Famous</i>&quot; and the 100th episode &quot;<i>
Sweet Seymour Skinner's Baadasssss Song</i>&quot;. This set brings a few weaker 
episodes with it - some purists cite &quot;<i>Bart Gets An Elephant</i>&quot; 
and &quot;<i>Lady Bouvier's Lover</i>&quot; as cases of the wacky outweighing 
the clever, so to speak, but to all intents and purposes, every episode here is 
simply great.<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Also among this season's events were 
Marge's infamous addiction to gambling in &quot;<i>$pringfield</i>&quot;; Bart 
managing to con a radio station out of an African elephant in the 
cleverly-titled &quot;<i>Bart Gets An Elephant</i>&quot;; and Homer's 
befriending of Ned Flanders - much to the latter's dismay - in &quot;<i>Homer 
Loves Flanders</i>&quot;. We also see Bart become Burns' heir, Lisa take on big 
business with her feminist Lisa Lionheart doll, and Apu coming to live with the 
Simpsons; not forgetting Homer's unforgettable antics teaching an adult 
education class on how to build a successful marriage and the entire town 
getting in touch with their inner child. To say season 5 was an eventful year 
for the show would be a gross understatement. This season also featured its 
fair share of guest stars, with big names such as Conan O'Brien, George 
Harrison, The Ramones, Robert Goulet, Sam Neill, Michelle Pfeiffer, Ernest 
Borgnine, James Brown, Buzz Aldrin, Kathleen Turner and more all popping up in 
Springfield, as well as regular special guests Kelsey Grammer and Phil Hartman 
also stopping by.<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This season's packaging follows the 
trend of the past four seasons, as you might expect. The four discs are held in 
a five-panel fold-out digipak enclosed in a cardboard slipcase - this time a 
lovely metallic deep red - with one panel holding the detailed episode booklet, 
featuring titles, synopses, original airdates, guest stars and details on 
episode-specific extras (including commentary participants). The booklet is 10 
pages long.<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The packaging art this season is even more 
goregously detailed than the previous four seasons'. It shows a display of the 
Simpson family seemingly taking part in a circus, a la the well-known 
extra-long couch gag, complete with trumpeting elephants, a magician, and 
scanticy-clad dancers. The discs as usual tie in with the artwork behind them. 
On the back of one of the panels is the letter from Matt Groening we've become 
accustomed to, in which he addresses this DVD set and the episodes it contains.
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The menus in the Simpsons' series are seemingly 
improving with each season set: these discs have the best navigation yet! When 
you insert a disc, after copyrigth warnings, the screen is divided into two. 
The top half contains a moving image featuring a Simpson family member; which 
after you have waited for a while will animate in one of several different ways 
- for example, on disc 1, we see Homer sleeping at the power plant; one of the 
animations sees him falling off of his chair. The bottom half of the screen 
lists the episodes along with the lovely Play All option, and an 
&quot;Extras&quot; button. Each episode has two small buttons next to it: 
choosing the first, featuring a triangle similar to a Play button, will play 
the episode; the other, with a &quot;+&quot; mark, will open a sub-menu (of 
which there can be several in a row) featuring scene, language, commentary and 
deleted scenes options. There is a chapter stop after the opening of the show 
for quick skipping.<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Once again, the principal extra is 
the commentary on every one of the 22 episodes in the set, featuring a vast 
array of contributors. Matt Groening, creator of the show himself, is present 
on a whopping 20 of these; other regulars throughout the set David Mirkin, Mark 
Kirkland, David Silverman, James L. Brooks, Conan O'Brien, Jon Lovitz, Wes 
Archer, Jon Vitti and Josh Weinstein. A few cast members also pop in &#150; Dan 
Castellaneta, Yeardley Smith, Hank Azaria &#150; and previous commentary 
heavyweight Al Jean gets away with just two this time around, as he was not a 
major staff member in season 5, and thus only appears on the season 4 holdover 
tracks.<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;One complaint many Simpsons fans have had with 
the sets has been the lack of a really complete, comprehensive documentary. But 
these 22 commentaries, totalling over 8 hours, are surely even better. Think of 
them as 23 minutes full of anecdotes, jokes and inside stories from the 
production of the episode &#150; they're really the most comprehensive 
collections of background information on the shows you could ever hope to have. 
With up to 7 or 8 contributors a time, there's rarely a quiet moment, and 
whilst the occasional sections of indecipheral information are present when 
more than one person is talking at a time, for the most part we get to hear 
some really interesting people discuss a really interesting show. The 
commentaries also prove just how funny the guys really are, even when not 
writing for the show: occasionally a commentary will go a little off-topic and 
we'll be treated to hilarious banter from the participants. The all-important 
interesting tidbits are also present: how else would we find out about Conan's 
antics backstage, or the cast's ad-libs?<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It's no 
surprise to learn that Fox have yet more up their sleeves for this package, 
though. Kicking off the additional bonus features is the &quot;Word From Matt 
Groening&quot; on disc 1, a short two-minute reel of quick season five clips 
over which Matt discusses the DVD. It's very similar to the printed letter on 
the package itself, and is in the same vein as his season 4 &quot;Word&quot;. 
There's also a short three-minute featurette from James L. Brooks on the last 
disc, looking back at the creation of the show and the first 100 episodes.<br>
 
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This time, the boat has really been pished out when it 
comes to deleted scenes. There are 40 of them, from 14 different episodes, 
totally a whopping 22 minutes. All are entertaining, and are in the later 
stages of production - the only thing really missing is some voice cleanup and 
sound effects. You view them inserted into their respective episodes, or as a 
reel with optional commentary by David Mirkin on the final disc.<br>
 &nbsp; 
&nbsp; &nbsp;As well as all of this, there are great &quot;Animation 
Showcases&quot; for four episodes &#150; &quot;<i>Treehouse Of Horror IV</i>
&quot;, &quot;<i>$pringfield</i>&quot;, &quot;<i>Bart Gets An Elephant</i>
&quot;, &quot;<i>Sweet Seymour Skinner's Baadasssss Song</i>&quot; - which 
feature multi-angle animation comparisons from different stages of the 
animation and original sketches - and some great commercials featuring the 
Simpsons from 1993 and 1994. There are several &quot;Illustrated 
Commentaries&quot;, each of which last an act of the original animatic, which 
feature several participants with the ability to &quot;draw&quot; on the 
screen; and finally, there is a James Taylor audio outtake from &quot;<i>Deep 
Space Homer</i>&quot;, and an option of watching all of &quot;<i>Sweet Seymour 
Skinner's Baadasssss Song</i>&quot; in four different languages, including 
Italian and Czechoslovakian. Whew!<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The audio-video 
quality on this set is excellent &#150; it's improving with each successive 
season, and whilst we're not quite up to the impressive digital quality we'll 
be expecting with the later seasons, we're getting a lot closer. This time 
round, the DD5.1 remaster is even better than last time, and whilst largely 
front-focused, directional effects sometimes do make their way to the back, and 
the overall clarity makes for an improved listening experience. French and 
Spanish DD2.0 soundtracks are also included, as are French, Spanish and English 
DHI subtitles. I extensively tested the English subtitles; they were very 
accurate and mostly in sync, but for some reason &quot;dropped out&quot; 
(disappeared) occasionally for a few seconds.<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Video 
quality is also improving. This time around, there are no digital defects to 
speak of at all. The full-frame presentation is bright and fully detailed; it's 
only marred by the limitation of the source material. There is minimal grain 
and shimmering, colours are vivid and there's no edge-enhancement to speak of.
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Once again, Fox and the team have done themselves 
proud. Everything that could have been improved with this package has been, and 
with such a brilliant collection of episodes and expansive extras, only a fool 
would pass up on the oppurtunity to pick up this fantastic set. Highly 
recommended.</p>

Marge Goes Head to Head With Queen<br>
<i>By Wesley Mead 
(wesley@snpp.com) -<b>December 22, 2004</b></i><br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Lucky 
viewers in Britain get a rare treat this Christmas Day. For the first time 
ever, Channel 4 are to a air a Simpsons short specially made for the channel, 
to celebrate the network's recent acquisition of the show in the UK.<br>
 
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Marge Simpson and co will be going head to head with the 
Queen herself in the 3 pm slot on the 25th, as the family are taking part in a 
special 5-minute short for Channel 4's acclaimed &quot;Alternative Christmas 
Message&quot; slot, which in previous years has involved Sharon Osbourne and 
Ali G.<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The speech promises to deliver quickfire 
sarcasm and satire in the way in which only the Simpsons can: those behind the 
penning of the short are all acclaimed Simpsons writers, and various previews 
of the speech obtained by the press have apparently delivered laughs thick and 
fast. Digs at many of Britain's celebs and politics are present and correct: 
Marge digs at David Beckham's much-publiscised alleged affair with Rebecca 
Loos, whilst jibes at everything from the current Bush-Blair relationship 
(&quot;You're like Mini Me to our Dr Evil - helping out in all our zany schemes 
to take over the world&quot;) to the nation's description of Santa Claus as 
&quot;Father Christmas&quot; are satirized.<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; 
&nbsp;Unfortunately, there are currently no plans to air this short outside of 
the UK, but for those of you who do live in the country, you can catch the clip 
at 3pm, 4:05pm, 6:10pm, 8:25pm and 10:35pm on Christmas Day on Channel 4. A set 
of preview clips is available on theChannel 4 web site.<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; 
&nbsp;<b>Update</b> (December 25, 2004) - Those of you not in the UK can 
download a 10 Mb Windows Media video clip fromHemusTVThemes. Thanks Mark! </p>
