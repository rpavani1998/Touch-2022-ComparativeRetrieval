all 3 (or non) of the above.<br>
<br>
 Which is the best ? or are all 3 rubbish

<blockquote> I think Family Guy is the best out of the three. I like The 
Simpsons and South Park, but Family Guy is alot more funnier imo. The Simpsons 
is still good to watch, it's just not the same anymore though. The older 
episodes are alot more funnier than the current ones.</blockquote>  Reply With

 Well if you or any others think you can't talk about a 
subject, without resorting to stupid name calling/insulting each other, I think 
that is a sensible choice Abo. </blockquote>  Reply With Quote <br>

<blockquote> The Simpsons episodes from the 90s and early 2000s make it the 
best animated series of all time. I don't even care if the new episodes suck, 
it will take a helluva lot to surpass that genius era of comedy.</blockquote>

 That's why they should have 
stopped when they were ahead. They're diluting that brilliance with this 
current brand of shite.</blockquote>  Reply With Quote <br>

<blockquote> I get that, but for me, they're never not gonna be ahead. They 
should just go back to writing episodes like they used to instead of the 
celebrity cameo heavy **** they do these days. I guess they've run out of ideas.
<br> <br>
 Still, that doesn't stop anyone from just watching the old episodes, 
which is what I do. I haven't seen any of the past 2-3 new series.</blockquote>

 I'm very open minded, but if I catch my kids watching Family 
Guy I would kick them out of the house, it is THAT bad, it is THAT lame and it 
is uneducated and full of low morals and obesity.</blockquote>  Reply With Quote

<blockquote> South park in my opinion is the best and the funniest out the 3. 
But then I do enjoy watching all 3, just lately Simpsons doesnt seem to be as 
good as it used to be.<br>

<blockquote> I like all 3... <br>
<br>
 but in order: <br>
<br>
 1) Simpsons 
<br> 2) South Park <br>
 3) Family guy <br>
<br>
 The gap between Simpsons and 
South Park isn't much since the Simpson's are turning to ****, but the gap 
between South Park and Family guy is substantial (but again, I like all 3)

<blockquote> <b>Family Guy - </b> <b>9.5/10 </b>Improving as it gets older, 
the occasional misfire with political episodes that suck, but great 9 out of 10 
times, Stewie/Brian and Peter episodes always being hilarious...<br>
<br>
<b>
Simpsons -</b> <b>7.5/10</b> Declining as it gets older, the occasional 
highlight, Lisa episodes are cringeworthy, Homer is still the best...<br>
<br>

<b>South Park - </b> <b>8/10</b> Depending on the topic, either brilliant 
(bouncy scrotum) or awful (imaginationland), one week great, one awful...<br>

<br> Honorable mention to Archer, Robot Chicken, Drawn Together, Cleveland 
Show, Futurama and American Dad...</blockquote>  Reply With Quote <br>

<blockquote> I used to love the Simpsons, but I think it's gone worse as times 
go by, I guess there's only so much you can do over 20 years though. Family Guy 
is okay, there are still some moments where I laugh, but I think you need to 
understand American culture/celebrities to appreciate more.<br>
<br>
 South 
Park is by some distance the best, some of the episodes are just genius, and 
Scott Tenorman must die is probably one of my favourite episdes from any show.
