</li> </ul>  About four 
years ago, the first &quot;cancel The Simpsons opinion articles were released 
onto online periodicals. Of course, at the time, I scoffed. That's not 
possible; this show is spectacular. I grew up with this show, quoting the lines 
from the previous night with such love and fervor, to a point where it became 
annoying. I steadfastly defended &quot;Homerpalooza,&quot; one of the episodes 
sometimes touted as the beginning of the quality slip.<br>
<br>
As time went 
on, however, I came to see their point. One of the few hilarious jokes in the 
past few years was the song &quot;They'll Never Stop 'The Simpsons,'&quot; a 
parody of &quot;We Didn't Start the Fire&quot; which essentially states that 
the series will continue no matter how bad it becomes. As the series nears 350 
episodes and sixteen seasons, I fear that they may have been more serious than 
they were letting on. The Simpsons has indeed become a cartoon, as MSN Slate 
writer Chris Suellentrop called it more than a year ago. It now contains 
mind-numbingly improbable events passed off as reality - remember the racing 
horse jockeys who were really leprechauns? That's a far cry from the positively 
side-splitting status the series held as an &quot;animated sitcom.&quot; Who's 
to blame for it? The writers? Producer Al Jean? &quot;Other&quot; producer Ian 
Maxtone-Graham? I can't say for sure, but one thing remains resolutely clear. 
This show needs to end, and fast.<br>
<br>
The characters have become broad and 
bland - Homer is a gleeful ignoramus, Bart is &quot;America's bad boy,&quot; 
Lisa an annoying activist. As storytelling, the series has become a joke. Often 
times, they waste a good ten minutes (sometimes fifteen) of an average 
22-minute episode on setup alone. Worst yet, they've recycled the plots over 
and over again - remember that episode where Lisa became a Buddhist, much to 
the chagrin of everyone before they came to tolerate her preferences. Oh, and 
Richard Gere was there, too. All well and good - if you completely missed the 
episode where Lisa became a vegetarian under similar circumstances. It was a 
much better episode, and had incomparably better guest voices to boot (Paul and 
Linda McCartney).  Continued... <br>

<p>I would like to comment on the article that claims the simpsons should be 
cancelled. One of the things that apparently bothers the author of that article 
is that the jokes made on current affairs aren't current. (Continued&hellip;)

<p>I know the simpsons isn't nearly as good as it used to be but you shouldn't 
base that on the treehouse of horror eppisodes. Those have been terrible ever 
since they began, in the second season. (Continued&hellip;)</p> Details &nbsp;

<p>Also, most audiences who watch shows like that don't care as much about the 
quality and character development, which FOX has shown by bringing back Family 
Guy instead of Futurama because it got better re-run ratings and more dvd 
sales. (Continued&hellip;)</p> Details &nbsp; Reply to this comment <br>

<p>While the author of this piece serves some valid food for thought, I would 
like to hear his musings on how well the Tracy Ullman Show &quot;Simpsons 
shorts&quot; stack up against any of the recent episodes. (Continued&hellip;)

<p>Right on! There isn't much in this article I would disagree with. I don't 
hate the Simpsons, in fact I love most of the episodes through season 6, but I 
can't think of a single episode made since 1998 that I would ever have the 
desire to see again. (Continued&hellip;)</p> Details &nbsp; Reply to this
