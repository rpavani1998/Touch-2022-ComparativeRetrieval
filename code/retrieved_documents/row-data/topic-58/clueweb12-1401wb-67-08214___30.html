<h2>Ratings: Four Great Women and Another All Time Low!</h2> 
<p>A total of <strong>5.16 million </strong>viewers watched last night&rsquo;s 
episode &lsquo;Four Great Women and a Manicure&rsquo;, making it the 
least-watched episode of all time. The previous all-time low belonged to March 
episode &lsquo;Lisa The Drama Queen&rsquo;, which had 5.75 million viewers, so 
not only is it a new record, it has taken a giant beating by its own weakest 
episode. With such a big gap, last night&rsquo;s episode is sure to remain the 
lowest figures for quite a while, but we&rsquo;ve been surprised before. All 
five of the least watched episodes have now come in this, the 20th Anniversary 
year.</p> 
<p>Family Guy had 6.47 million viewers at 9:00, keeping it as the number one 
performer for Fox on Sunday nights. King Of The Hill had 4.10 million viewers 
and American Dad 4.95 million, which, compared to The Simpsons at 8:00 in a 
more accessible timeslot is actually impressive.</p> 
<p>Low ratings have been blamed on lots of things before, but there&rsquo;s no 
question about it: people do not like these &lsquo;storytelling&rsquo; 
episodes. They alienate the casual Simpsons viewer, who are likely to turn off 
or just not tune in to begin with if the stories do not interest them. Even I 
did not want to watch it, but for the purposes of this website I forced myself 
to. The show would be doing itself a favor in dropping these episodes entirely 
and having the season cut short one episode.</p> 
<p>Rate the episode below, and try not to give it an &lsquo;excellent&rsquo; 
grade just because Simpsons R da kewlest.</p>

<p>Not really surprised. Season 20 has been, without a doubt, the worst season 
ever. Let it be known that within minutes after each episode I was on the 
internet expressing my disaproval.</p> Reply <br>

<p>All this indicates is that the average Simpsons viewer doesn&rsquo;t even 
come close to appreciating the subtle philosophical, historical, and political 
nuances that these storytelling episodes ooze with.</p> 
<p>Maggie&rsquo;s first full oratory, beautifully executed by Jodie Foster, 
was another example of The Simpson&rsquo;s tongue-in-cheek, philosophical 
approach at getting the point across.</p> 
<p>It&rsquo;s funny how such a smart and successful show can be lost on such 
an obviously obtuse viewership.</p> Reply <br>

hilarious to a point that it reminds me of the good old days hehe.</p>

<p>Season 20 is nowhere near the worst season ever, the only two reasons why 
the episode was bad is because there was NO mention or appearance of Bart and 
it was a story-telling episode. I mean where is the main rock star of the show.

<p>Sure, season 20 may be a sucky season (Alaska Nebraska can go jump of a 
cliff for all I care), but Four Great Woman And A Manicure is the best episode 
this season, alongside The Burns and the Bees and How The Test Was Won.</p> 
<p>What I don&rsquo;t get is why all the actually good episodes get bad 
reviews from critics and why all the episodes that suck ballz are considered 
&ldquo;excellent&rdquo; to the critics. IT JUST PISSES ME THE F*CK OFF!</p>

<p>Bloody hell. Those are awful ratings, 0.6 lower than the previous record. 
Bet FOX are chopping the axe. Doesn&rsquo;t matter how good the episode is, 5.1 
is diabolical. Thats considered bad ratings for a popular show in the UK. 
Unacceptable. Shocking. Awful. Tis a shame, but you cant go on with ratings 
like that forever, someones gotta buck there ideas up. The Simpsons side is 
doing everything, theme parks, new games etc. But the thing is they need to 
bring out something new, give the series a revamp. Spice it up some way or 
another.</p> 
<p>Plan B is to move it off FOX and get it onto another network, the change 
might make new viewers as people who say hate FOX might be willing to watch it 
on the new channel. Perhaps at the extremist length skip a year to recoup the 
ideas, lets be fair, these guys have been working pretty much non-stop for 20 
years now with a movie, games and so forth being released as well. Give them a 
break, might make the audience hungry for it and boost the ratings again.</p> 
<p>Some extremist measures there and maybe I&rsquo;m going OTT here, but might 
have to be done.</p> Reply <br>

<p>I&rsquo;m not in the US, so I didn&rsquo;t see the advertising for this ep, 
but did they hype the fact that adult Maggie was finally going to speak at all? 
I remember when baby Maggie had her first word all those years back, it was a 
huge deal; Fox hyped it like crazy. This seems like it should have been another 
&ldquo;event&rdquo; episode, even if it was a fantasy sequence. So did they 
hype it at all or was it another missed opportunity for the Fox marketing 
machine?</p> 
<p>As far as cancellation goes, there&rsquo;s two schools of thought there. 
The first is obvious: show&rsquo;s ratings are down so low that it&rsquo;s time 
to start packing it in. But there&rsquo;s the other side of the coin, which 
considers the fact that the show is still making Fox a LOT of money from 
merchandise and tie-ins. That&rsquo;s the main reason The Simpsons is still 
around. (also, its numbers on Hulu are apparently great.) There&rsquo;s also 
the fact that while its ratings are down, Fox has nothing to replace it with 
&mdash; King of the Hill is gone after this season, American Dad always falls 
behind The Simpsons in the ratings (even on low-rated episodes like this one) 
and Sit Down Shut Up is pretty much dead on arrival.</p> 
<p>If The Cleveland Show posts Family Guy-type numbers consistently next 
season, Fox may decide to axe The Simpsons, but if its numbers are at the level 
of American Dad, it probably won&rsquo;t for a while yet. It&rsquo;s still 
consistently the second-highest rated show on a night where Fox is having 
trouble introducing new content.</p> Reply <br>

<p>Ratings are starting to mean less now that there are internet downloads. 
Also, like it said, these episodes aren&rsquo;t cared about by many fans I 
actually like the multi-stories episodes. They add variety. This was no 
exception. Another great episode in this very consistant season. 5/5</p> Reply

<p>FOX already renewed it for two more seasons. It will take a lot more than

<p>Hulu is probably a little responsible for lower T.V. ratings. I&rsquo;m 
never really home sundays at 8pm anymore so I&rsquo;ve probably watched half of 
this current season mondays on the internet. It&rsquo;s a shame though, I 
laughed alot throughout the newest episode and a less funny episode of Family 
Guy beat it in the ratings.</p> Reply <br>

<p>well the 20th season has been really boring as such.this episode was 
actually better than some of the previous ones. it was better than 
&ldquo;Wedding for Disaster&rdquo; which was i think &ldquo;the worst episode

<p>I&rsquo;m with valhum, this season reminded me a lot of older seasons too, 
a great thing to see! And you can&rsquo;t judge an episode on it&rsquo;s 
ratings, you can only judge the previous week&rsquo;s episode; that&rsquo;s why 
people decide to come back or not.</p> Reply <br>

<p>I totally disagree. I think season 20 has done a lot of improvements.</p> 
<p>To keep improving I thing they should rethink the gags. Many of them are 
very predictable. I also think that there should be more Ralph. This guy is 
unpredictable, and says the funniest things.</p> 
<p>Maggie is also awesome when she tries to hurt Homer. This is something 
Family Guy stole from them, and it has worked awesome. The Simpsons should take 
this back, because unlike Stevie, Maggie does not fail when hurting Homer.</p> 
<p>People should stop talking about the show cancellation. You can start to 
worry once King of the Hill, and American Dad get canceled, since they have 
lower ratings most of the time.</p> 
<p>Remember that we still have to see the episodes written by Dan 
Castellaneta, and Seth Rogen<br>
 Season 20 is not a bad season.</p> Reply <br>

<p>@ Diogo- Yeah, You say little country like Portugal, what should I say 
about Serbia? We are almost secret country in south-eastern Europe, and rates 
like 5, 6 and 7 millions are almost impossible to imagine, but when we are 
talking about country with population about 300 million, number of 5 or 6 
millions isn&rsquo;t that big, in fact, it&rsquo;s insignificant&hellip;</p>

<p>dude, I think you&rsquo;re a little harsh on this and all the story telling 
episodes. you don&rsquo;t tune into the Simpsons to get what you want much like 
going to a concert you go or watch to get what they grace you with. Ratings may 
be down but don&rsquo;t for a second consider that to indicate that people 
didn&rsquo;t want to tune in because it was a story episode. Tastes of tv 
viewers today are changing as I&rsquo;m sure you can infer from the ratings of 
family guy consistently being higher. today&rsquo;s viewer would rather watch a 
23 minute episode of random disconnected allusions to 80s movies and extended 
scenes of people falling down and aching over their pain for way too long. The 
Simpsons remain one of the best written shows on TV their writers continue to 
do justice to a 20 year old brand, no small accomplishment. I suggest sitting 
back and enjoying every remaining episode. This is a simpsons blog, promote the 
show don&rsquo;t denigrate it with your personal ratings driven BS commentary, 
write about the episode the highlights, promote the show promote the greatness 
that it continues to be. the Simpsons are the Jimi Hendrix of TV shows, there 
aren&rsquo;t off shows just ones that appeal to differing viewers. The show 
rocks regardless of the ratings, don&rsquo;t let the data drive your posts but 
rather inform them. Be the advocate for the simpsons you wanted to be when you 
started and leave the mother f&amp;*(#^% to the critics. Let&rsquo;s keep this 
show going as long as we can by promoting the greatness that it is.</p> Reply

<p>That is true, this is a Simpsons blog. It is my Simpsons blog. And if I 
want to denigrate the show for the sake of creating good discussion I&rsquo;ll 
do it.</p> 
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t mean I was lying about my opinion. If I hadn&rsquo;t 
learned to TRY to enjoy every remaining episode this site would have been dead 
in the water long ago, but when we get one of these episodes churned out year 
after year, I, personally, am not interested.</p> 
<p>The very term &lsquo;blog&rsquo; refers to personal opinions and 
commentary. I am offering my personal opinion on the overnight ratings.</p> 
<p>The comments section is for people like you to disagree. Thank you for 
participating.</p> 
<p>For the record, The Wettest Stories Ever Told (another storytelling 
episode), back in 2006, had 7.04 million viewers which, at the time, was the 
second lowest audience on record. Revenge Is A Dish Best Served 3 Times in 2007 
delivered a season low in January with 8 million (before a large slump in 
April). Do a search on all of these &lsquo;Trilogy&rsquo; episodes here at 
Simpsons Channel and our ratings reports seem to always mention 
&lsquo;low&rsquo;.</p> 
<p>The poll show far shows that slightly more people do actually like these 
episodes, but when you consider that the people voting are the devoted fans who 
will watch regardless of quality (because they come to a Simpsons site every 
week), I think there is some substance to the fact that this storytelling 
episode was, certainly not the only factor, but one of the factors influencing 
the figures.</p> Reply <br>

<p>&ldquo;Axe the Simpsons&rdquo;? Haha not likely. They make FOX way too much

7th season. Not to mention they create such an inconsistent number of episodes

<p>If they did them twice a year&hellip; one the Treehouse of Horrors, and 
another, something else, I think it would be fine&hellip;</p> 
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it was just the &lsquo;trilogy&rsquo;&hellip; I think 
it was Marge and Lisa. They are probably as unpopular as clipshows (which 
sometimes have their moments).</p> 
<p>I&rsquo;d rather see a longer episode, of course; and it seems like there 
are way too many of these kinda off-kilter variety and what-if episodes 
lately&hellip; I&rsquo;m pretty sure the ratings will keep dropping if these 
trends continue.</p> Reply <br>

<p>I&rsquo;m with Unpossible here, he makes a good point. The fact the 
Simpsons may still be running is FOX or generating a huge income from the 
merch, the dvd&rsquo;s etc. Maybe The Simpsons could have been gone a long time 
ago, we got to thank us folk love it so much.</p> 
<p>Actually I agree with Unpossible on everything here, he speaks good words.
</p> 
<p>Adam, I was wondering in this case, if it would be possible to find out the 
hulu ratings as well and compare it? Might be more of a helpful benefactor in 
the terms of the new age of technology and the 21st century. TV might not be 
the best way to give ratings any more.</p> Reply <br>

<p>I think this rating is bad but not very bad like American Dad!, The 
Simpsons in the season 4 they have 21 &ndash; 28 million of viewers and they 
only have 4 &ndash; 6 million of viewers. King of the Hills they are in season 
13, The Simpsons in this season they have 11 &ndash; 19 million of viewers, and 
King of the Hills in this season they have 3 &ndash; 6 million of viewers. 
Family Guy is MoreLess in season 7, The Simpsons have much rating they have 16 
&ndash; 23 million of viewers, and Family Guy has 6 &ndash; 10 million of 
viewers. Sit Down, Shut Up, Of this show i don&rsquo;t talk! they have of 
rating 1 &ndash; 5 million of viewers In season 1!, The Simpsons have 29 
&ndash; 35 million of viewers.</p> 
<p>Cancel The Simpsons is not good is the second more watched in the night in 
Fox &rdquo;The Cleveland Show&rdquo; i don&rsquo;t think so much of this show 
the rating is gonna be like &rdquo;American Dad!&rdquo;. So i think 
&rdquo;Worry more about American Dad!, and Sit Down, Shut Up of the 
cancellation&rdquo; i don&rsquo;t said &rdquo;King of the Hills&rdquo; because 
is canceled so &rdquo;The Simpsons&rdquo; is gonna be for more years because 
Fox is famous for Simpsons in the beginning. So don&rsquo;t worry about 
&rdquo;The Simpsons&rdquo;. Because in season 20 they have 5 &ndash; 11 million 
of viewers.</p> Reply <br>

<p>i don&rsquo;t enjoy clip shows that much because the stories go by to fast 
and i&rsquo;ve been feeling like the material is too rushed on full length 
episodes. Although i still love the simpsons and will watch them until they are 
cancelled I think the quality has gone down because the writers now have to 
appeal to the slack jawed yokels like the family guy fans who want senseless 
entertainment with no thought or subtle humor. people now days are less 
inclined to think about what they watch. I would rather see the simpsons axed 
then see them lower their standards to imitate family guy</p> Reply <br>

<p>I think next year the premiere will get around 8 million viewers and it 
settle in around their for the first half of next year. After that it could do 
this. If not I see 23 seasons being it.</p> Reply <br>

<p>jeff@ It would be really great if the Simpsons could make more then 10 
millions in premiere season, but I think it&rsquo;s more likely that number 
will be around 8 millions&hellip;<br>
 It&rsquo;s very important that first 
episodes of new season get high rates just to show people from FOX that 
Simpsons got what to offer to viewers and that viewers like it!</p> Reply <br>

<p>and how many people have it PVR&rsquo;d or Tivo&rsquo;d as well? I think 
this season has been very entertaining, not slapstick funny but sophisticated.
</p> 
<p>Also,it seems like FOX does NO advertisment for the show now, its usually a 
Family Guy commercial with a quick quip, of the Simpsons being at 8/9C (at 
least from a Canadian&rsquo;s point of view)</p> 
<p>I would like to see a show runner change, maybe to Mirkin again but I dont 
think it will be the end of the show by any means. Maybe 5 years from now, but 
even though the show isn&rsquo;t the astronomical ratings juggernaut that it 
once was. It still probably is still a big boost for FOX. For the people that 
want the show to end, what will FOX put on in replace of it?</p> Reply <br>

<p>I must admit that I didn&rsquo;t enjoy this episode so much. I&rsquo;m not 
a big fan of the fantasy-story episodes or even the Treehouse of Horror 
episodes (personal taste).<br>
 I find that these episodes purposely go beyond 
the Simpsons universe and make them uncomfortable for me to watch&hellip; the 
writers seem to show less care in storytelling, and you sit in fear of what is 
going to happen to your favourite Simpsons characters next. I think this 
careless approach to the Simpsons universe is what makes a lot of the most 
recent episodes unsuccessful.</p> 
<p>However, I have found some of the episodes in this series to be very good, 
namely &ldquo;How the test was one&rdquo; and &ldquo;The good, the sad and the 
drugly&rdquo;.<br>
 While I&rsquo;m sure the writers are trying to find fresh 
ways to make new episodes, I still enjoy watching the classic Simpsons episodes 
which had a GREAT balance of humour, storytelling and heart.<br>
 I&rsquo;m not 
interested in Family-Guy-type shows that gets most of its laughs from sexually 
awkward punchlines and randomness. Anyone can write that garbage. I hope the 
Simpsons doesn&rsquo;t hit that low. I have been a fan of the Simpsons since I 
was 5, and still try to stay loyal to the show &ndash; but even I have come to 
admit that most episodes really suck!</p> 
<p>P.S. I did love the references to Disney&rsquo;s Snow White &amp; 7 dwarves!

<p>I don&rsquo;t think it is bad if they keep making episodes for the fans. I 
mean, Star Trek is a only fan based show. By fan i mean geeks who are totally 
into it. Just look at all the years they have been making episodes for those 
fans. Now look at their movie. They have made it for the public in general.</p> 
<p>With the simpsons is just that the general public are getting tired of 20 
years. Maybe what they need is just to forget a bit about the Simpsons, and 
have them back once they miss them.</p> 
<p>We don&rsquo;t have to hate the show just because of the ratings.Or maybe 
it is that you are a really big fan, and instead you just hate the idea of 
having the show canceled?</p> Reply <br>

<p>I dont think Fox will ever cancel The Simpsons. The show will only stop 
when the Producers or Actors decide to stop.</p> Reply <br>

<p>@Dick- And why would producers and actors stop the show if TV wants new 
episodes? They will run out of ideas? No&hellip; The only reason why this show 
will stop are viewers: If they don&rsquo;t want to see new episodes- there wont 
be new episodes. But luckily people still like the Simpsons, so there&rsquo;s 
no reason to worry!</p> Reply <br>

<p>Hi everyone.<br>
 I havn&rsquo;t seen this episode yet because I live in 
England and as far as I know, it hasn&rsquo;t been aired here yet. I&rsquo;d 
just like to say that the ratings were very bad for this episode &ndash; 
It&rsquo;s a shame. I actually really like the &ldquo;storytelling&rdquo; 
episodes alot. Wouldn&rsquo;t it be cool if they made &ldquo;22 short films 
about Springfield Part 2&Prime;? lol. I havn&rsquo;t seen any episodes on 
Season 20, but I love all the seasons that I&rsquo;ve seen anyway (especially 
the godlen era: Season 3 &ndash; 12) but so far, I think Season 15 is the 
worst, however, I do love it. Season 18 and 19 were awesome! I hope Season 20 
is a follow-on haha.</p> Reply <br>

<p>I&rsquo;m glad the ratings for The Simpsons has dropped. The show NEEDS to 
be canceled for it&rsquo;s own good. It sucked since the eleventh season, and 
ratings prove it. The first nine seasons had over 14 million viewers each week. 
After that, it dropped to 8 million and below. Sad. The show just isn&rsquo;t 
funny anymore and A LOT of people have lost interest.</p> Reply <br>

<p>I disagree with the idea that the quality of a given episode is responsible 
for its ratings.</p> 
<p>It&rsquo;s the quality of the previous episode(s) that influences the 
ratings for a given episode.</p> 
<p>If you have a great episode (and I think this was by far the absolute best 
episode these last couple seasons) and it follows a lackluster episode, 
you&rsquo;ll have low ratings.</p> 
<p>A good episode gets people recommending the show again and you saw the 
audience tick up the next week.</p> 
<p>I didn&rsquo;t see the promos as I don&rsquo;t watch anything else on FOX, 
but the few promos I&rsquo;ve seen these past few years are usually a footnote 
to Family Guy promos (as in &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s all watch a great Family Guy 
this week! Incidentally there&rsquo;ll be a Simpsons, maybe it won&rsquo;t suck 
but Family Guy rules&rdquo;).</p> 
<p>FOX has done a horrendous job promoting the Simpsons (essentially hyping it 
to the moon when it didn&rsquo;t need hype and switching to hyping Family Guy 
&ndash; which I find unfunny and essentially unwatchable.)</p> 
<p>But back to my point, given that audiences can&rsquo;t know if a given 
episode will be strong or weak on any given night, it&rsquo;s the quality (or 
lack thereof) of the preceding episodes that is reflected in the ratings.</p> 
<p>Case in point, the show lost 2 million viewers after a series of lackluster 
shows during the strike, culminating with the horrifically bad That 90s Show 
episode which was barely coherent and clearly needed all the tinkering it could 
get before being presented to the public.</p> Reply <br>

<p>The truth is, there&rsquo;s nothing wrong with the show. It&rsquo;s better 
than ever! But after SO MANY episodes, the characters can&rsquo;t have the same 
impact they once had.</p> 
<p>(So yes, the solution is Poochie. Or more specifically, &ldquo;Roy&rdquo;)

<p>Since the movie, the show has been getting a LOT better again. I 
don&rsquo;t want it to ever end; I want it to be, in length terms, the SNL of 
Fox (not Madtv!). And screw all this obsession over &lsquo;is it still 
good&rsquo;. Get a life. TV shows aren&rsquo;t meant to save the world for you, 
you are.</p> Reply <br>

<p>True I hate these type of episodes and like you said they don&rsquo;t go 
with the story. Also most of them are boring. Hopefully they won&rsquo;t make 
another one like this for a long timeeeeeee!!!!</p> Reply <br>
