<p>That&rsquo;s amazing, 21 seasons. I still love this show, despite some of 
the lackluster episodes.</p> Reply <br>

<p>Cheers 4 Simpsons! <br>
 This is great news, I hope that next season will 
be much better than the last one (if it is possible ). </p> 
<p>We can only hope that Simpsons will have a lot of viewers, so FOX will make 
contract for another season (or even seasons).</p> Reply <br>

<p>@RMCC(Portugal)<br>
 Yeah, I know for that, but a lot of fans were frighten 
when people from FOX said that they gonna reconsider their contract when they 
saw not-so-great ratings&hellip;<br>
 Hope that new season gonna bring 
something good, so that FOX gonna make new contract.</p> Reply <br>

<p>I&rsquo;m pretty sure the Everyman episode is the one Seth Rogan + his 
writing partner wrote. I was afraid it got thrown out because I was expecting 
it during season 20.</p> Reply <br>

<p>my wish is to see the simpsons reach season 30 without growing stale. 
definitley one of the best/smartest shows on television</p> Reply <br>

<p>I&rsquo;m one of those fans who think the Simpsons has gotten very stale 
and formulaic, but will probably never tear themselves away from the show. This 
seasons had some good eps, but on the whole was very poor. Since they&rsquo;re 
such a staple, I&rsquo;d hope that they&rsquo;d take some risks. How about some 
guest writers or directors? Or having a plot continue over a number of weeks?
</p> 
<p>I wish they&rsquo;d do a season where it&rsquo;s one (or more) big 
over-arching plot line, like Arrested Development. And for God&rsquo;s sake, 
shake things up! It&rsquo;s not like they&rsquo;ll lose any viewers&hellip;</p>

<p>Ya, I hope that it will keep going for a while too, despite all the quality 
complaints.</p> Reply <br>

<p>So am I the only person who&rsquo;s NOT looking forward to that Everyman 
stuff (which, by the way, IS the Seth Rogen episode, although I thought 
he&rsquo;d be able to write something more original than that)?</p> Reply <br>

<p>i hope there is another episode like &ldquo;who shot mt burns&rdquo; where 
there was an exciting two parter (but this time make them on the same season).
</p> 
<p>I hope The Simpsons NEVER end!!! I LOVE THE SHOW</p>

<p>@Dominic- It&rsquo;s little unrealistic to expect that the Simpsons will 
run for ever, we are all aware that it&rsquo;s not possible, but what we can 
hope for is another 4-5 seasons. We shouldn&rsquo;t be disappointed with one or 
two year contract with FOX, it is just one more little victory for the show and 
one more step forward.</p> Reply <br>

<p>@Dominic &ndash; On a different point, they wouldn&rsquo;t put a two parter 
mid-season cos, well it would be less suspensful and the people who watched the 
season finale would be eager to watch the season premiere and therefore that 
equals higher ratings.</p> Reply <br>

<p>I wish FOX would release Season 99 (2088-2089) episodes of The Simpsons on 
DVD years before they&rsquo;re actually aired. It will be interesting to 
actually watch a TV series that may very well outlive several generations of 
Americans.</p> Reply <br>

<p>Why are they airing a treehouse of horror one so early? Wouldn&rsquo;t it 
make more sense to air it closer to Halloween?<br>
 But other than that, it 
looks really interesting and I can&rsquo;t wait for it to air in Australia.</p>

<p>This show is a hundred percent better than Family Guy. If you think the 
Simpsons are getting boring just watch Family Guy. The Simpsons will rise up 
again and destroy Family Guy for the garbage that it is. Long live the Simpsons.
