<h2>  Summary </h2> 
<p><i><b>Family Guy</b></i>, an American cartoon, is essentially <i>The 
Simpsons</i> of the late 2000's, sitting comfortably between <i>South Park</i> 
and<i>The Simpsons</i> in terms of art and comedic style. The humor of <i>
Family Guy</i> is mostly just cut-away skits, bland cultural references, and 
catchphrases relying onrandomness and overacting as excuses for actual jokes, 
like<i>Robot Chicken</i> but with a plot that usually takes itself too 
seriously (which<i>Robot Chicken</i> could get away with since it was simply a 
sketch comedy show and had no plot).</p> 
<p><i>Family Guy</i> has somehow spawned several spin-off shows like <i>The 
Cleveland Show</i> and <i>American Dad</i>, all of which are exactly the same 
but focus on slightly different character archetypes and are consequently less 
funny than<i>Family Guy</i> already was due to each series detracting the 
effort going into writing from each other all at once. The<i>Family Guy</i> 
fanbase mainly consists of 13-year old boys andstrange, rabid adults. </p> 
<h2> Survival</h2> 
<p>The show was originally aired in April 1999, nestled gently between <i>The 
Simpsons</i> and <i>The X-Files</i> on Sundays for its first season. FOX moved 
it to Thursdays to compete with<i>Fraiser</i> and it performed horribly. FOX 
then aired the show sporadically everywhere hoping to find a spot that would 
perform well before figuring out that it would never survive and cancelling at 
the end of the season, but was mysteriously revived again for another try.</p> 
<p><i>Family Guy</i> was placed up against <i>Friends</i> where it suffered 
again due to its lack of quality, then was moved around with no notice before 
being cancelled again. It was then bought byAdult Swim on Cartoon Network, 
becoming its highest rated show (which isn't saying much for a late-night 
network that is mostly watched by 13-year-olds staying up past their bedtime and
strange, rabid adults who can't get to sleep), as well as the highest bought 
DVD next to<i>The Chappelle's Show</i>. FOX saw <i>Family Guy'</i>s newfound 
potential for making piles of money and so re-bought the show, airing it again 
in 2005.</p> 
<h2> Fanbase</h2> 
<p>Even before Family Guy's infamous cancellation spree, it had a devoted 
following on the Internet. The episode &quot;Family Guy Viewer Mail #1&quot; is 
based off of emails the Family Guy writing staff received from fans, sort of 
like the Strong Bad Emails fromHomestar Runner. It was this colorful fanbase 
that got the word out about the show and supported the DVD sales.</p> 
<p><i>Family Guy</i> has since become viral through YouTube, Wikipedia, Hulu, 
Facebook, YTMND, and many other websites. Countless <i>Family Guy</i> videos on 
YouTube have millions of views, with the video &quot;Bird is the Word!&quot; 
having over 42,000,000 views (which also isn't surprising considering the 
relative IQ of an average YouTuber). It is the most viewed TV show on Hulu as 
well. On Facebook,<i>Family Guy</i> has 30 million fans. Every single Family 
Guy episode has a detailedWikipedia page, explaining every reference and joke 
to an obsessive degree previously only reserved forFan Wikis. </p> 
<p>There are thousands of Family Guy-related YTMNDs as well to annoy everyone. 
The show has alsofeatured memes like Peanut Butter Jelly Time, Ding Fries Are 
Done, even going so low as to Rickroll, and arguably has started some memes of 
its own likeGlenn Quagmire. </p> 
<h2>  Origins </h2> 
<p>Before <i>Family Guy</i> became what it is now, it was <i>Larry and Steve
</i>, a show about a middle-aged man and his dog that was made in Hanna-Barbera 
style and was broadcasted in Cartoon Network's<i>Premiere Toons</i> show. Fox 
eventually approached MacFarlane about making a show, which became<i>Family Guy
</i> and was slightly based off of <i>Larry and Steve</i> and began adding <i>
The Simpsons</i> elements of typical family hi-jinks. </p> 
<h2>  Current status </h2> 
<p>Nine seasons later, Family Guy still has a place in Internet Culture just 
as things likeCtrl Alt Del and You laugh, you lose have their own places in 
Internet Culture. On May 8th, 2011,<i>Family Guy</i> remade their famous parody 
of &quot;Peanut Butter Jelly Time&quot; from 2005. More recently, aFamily Guy 
MMO has emerged. It is currently in a closed beta stage, with pre-registration 
available.</p>
