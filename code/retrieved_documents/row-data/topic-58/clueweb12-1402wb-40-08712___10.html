<h3> TELEVISION: 20 years - A 'Simpsons' extravaganza </h3> 
<p> Anonymous The Niagara Gazette Thu Sep 25, 2008, 09:58 AM EDT </p> 
<p>BY PHIL DZIKIY AND PAUL LANE<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
 It appears &ldquo;The 
Simpsons&rdquo; is like the New Coke. It&rsquo;ll be around forever.<br>
<br>
 
All right, maybe it won&rsquo;t be around forever, but it certainly feels that 
way. The show&rsquo;s 20th season starts Sunday (8 p.m. Fox), with the season 
premiere featuring Homer Simpson and Ned Flanders as bounty hunters.<br>
<br>
 
From a crudely animated series of short clips on the Tracey Ullman Show to a 
cultural phenomenon, there&rsquo;s a lot to be said regarding the long-lasting 
power of &ldquo;The Simpsons.&rdquo; And who better to say it than Night &amp; 
Day&rsquo;s resident &ldquo;Simpsons&rdquo; experts, Phil Dzikiy and Paul Lane?
<br><br>
<br>
<br>
 QUESTION: 20 years is a long time. Why has &ldquo;The 
Simpsons&rdquo; lasted so long, and what makes the show so great?<br>
<br>
<br>

<br> PAUL: I am really not sure why &ldquo;The Simpsons&rdquo; has lasted. The 
show has remained quality for the vast majority of its 20 years on the air, and 
it still posts solid, if not spectacular ratings. Perhaps its placement on Fox 
&mdash; never known for having the highest standards &mdash; has something to 
do with that, but I&rsquo;d like to think not.<br>
<br>
 Rather, &ldquo;The 
Simpsons&rdquo; is like that comfortable shirt you won&rsquo;t get rid of no 
matter how much your spouse protests &mdash; it&rsquo;s been there for you for 
years, never fails to deliver and makes you feel just a tad better.<br>
<br>
 
There&rsquo;s also the animation factor, of course &mdash; in real life, Homer 
would belong to the AARP, Lisa would be a doctor and Maggie would be months 
from her college graduation.<br>
<br>
 I have held some 10 jobs since 
graduating from college eight years ago; I can&rsquo;t imagine having the 
desire to do the same thing for 20 years, but nearly everyone involved with 
this series has. Thankfully, none of them has lost any zeal for the job, which 
is another part of this equation. Everyone involved WANTS &ldquo;The 
Simpsons&rdquo; to be good, so it is.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
 PHIL: The show was 
once both a marketing and ratings juggernaut for Fox. It&rsquo;s absolutely the 
most important show in the history of the network, so &ldquo;The 
Simpsons&rdquo; gets free reign, for the most part. To compare the situation to 
another medium, the show is like the Quentin Tarantino to Fox&rsquo;s Miramax.
<br><br>
 As for greatness, there are really too many reasons to name, but 
here&rsquo;s a one-two punch: Great characters and some of the best writing 
television has ever seen.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
 Q: Is there any way to sum up the 
cultural impact of &ldquo;The Simpsons?&rdquo; Just how wide-reaching is it?<br>
<br> <br>
<br>
 PAUL: Has any other show invented multiple words put into the 
dictionary, delivered a hit movie, offered more quotable lines than every movie 
you saw in college combined, been more recognizable or made more money? I 
don&rsquo;t think so.<br>
<br>
 Rather than just having a cultural impact, 
&ldquo;The Simpsons&rdquo; has become a part of life. The series can make 
biting commentary when it wants to &mdash; including about itself &mdash; but 
more often than not it&rsquo;s merely meant to deliver a few chuckles, which 
many people don&rsquo;t get enough of in life and desire more of.<br>
<br>
 
There&rsquo;s a generation of students now who don&rsquo;t remember life 
without the show (heck, I barely do). Whether the new shows that air Sunday 
nights or the reruns that are rivaled on syndication only by &ldquo;Law &amp; 
Order,&rdquo; everyone is at least familiar with it on a cursory level. 
It&rsquo;s like cloudy Buffalo afternoons in March &mdash; always there. 
Especially in an era where new shows are aired for the first time with their 
heads already fastened into the guillotine, there&rsquo;s no series that ever 
again will pull this off. That&rsquo;s what has embiggened &ldquo;The 
Simpsons&rdquo; to the cromulent place the series holds in the world today.<br>

<br> <br>
<br>
 PHIL: I think there are people out there who use words like 
&ldquo;D&rsquo;oh!&rdquo; and &ldquo;Yoink!&rdquo; who haven&rsquo;t even seen 
an episode of &ldquo;The Simpsons.&rdquo; And if the Simpsons aren&rsquo;t the 
most recognizable fictional characters in the world, they have to be pretty 
close.<br>
<br>
 Before &ldquo;The Simpsons,&rdquo; most people considered 
animation to be a child&rsquo;s medium, especially on television. It&rsquo;s an 
unfortunate belief to begin with, but that&rsquo;s definitely changed. Without 
&ldquo;The Simpsons,&rdquo; it would have been a tough road for &ldquo;Family 
Guy,&rdquo; &ldquo;King of the Hill,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Critic&rdquo; and 
(obviously) &ldquo;Futurama.&rdquo; Even &ldquo;South Park&rdquo; would have a 
tough time getting on the air of a cable network without the success of 
&ldquo;The Simpsons.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
 Stepping outside of animation, any show 
without a laugh track owes some debt to &ldquo;The Simpsons,&rdquo; as do shows 
with quick-paced fantasy sequences.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
 Q: How does the show 
stack up to other sitcom greats?<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
 PAUL: &ldquo;Cheers&rdquo; 
immediately comes to mind when I think of the best series ever. It didn&rsquo;t 
have as long a run, but there wasn&rsquo;t a single bad episode, nor one that 
was even really sub-par compared to the rest. The same can&rsquo;t be said of 
&ldquo;The Simpsons,&rdquo; but the series has rebounded in recent years with 
many decent episodes and is still an &ldquo;in place&rdquo; for 
Hollywood&rsquo;s elite to be featured as a guest star.<br>
<br>
 If you 
condensed the run of &ldquo;The Simpsons&rdquo; into the time that 
&ldquo;Cheers&rdquo; aired, the quality would probably approach that of the 
Boston-based bar show. The only other series I could put up there in terms of 
quality would be &ldquo;Seinfeld,&rdquo; and even that series tailed off at the 
end with a much shorter run.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
 PHIL: It&rsquo;s at the top. 
That&rsquo;s right. Number one. There isn&rsquo;t another sitcom in TV history 
that has maintained its greatness for so many years. I would put at least eight 
seasons (three through 10) up against the seasons of any show. 
&ldquo;Seinfeld&rdquo; probably comes closest as far as recent shows go, but if 
I could only watch one sitcom for the rest of my life, &ldquo;The 
Simpsons&rdquo; wins in a landslide.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
 Q: Has the show 
maintained its spark, power and wit? Have any other animated shows surpassed it?
<br><br>
<br>
<br>
 PAUL: I&rsquo;d say yes to the first question, the show 
just lacks in some of the richness that earlier seasons delivered, where three 
plotlines in a single show would all feel like the best thing you&rsquo;d seen 
that entire year.<br>
<br>
 No show has surpassed it, but &ldquo;South 
Park&rdquo; could if it continues its upward trend; unlike &ldquo;The 
Simpsons,&rdquo; &ldquo;South Park&rdquo; has become far more clever as time 
has passed, with its double meanings and social commentary surrounded by some 
of the best writing on television.<br>
<br>
 &ldquo;King of the Hill&rdquo; 
will never be mentioned at the zenith of animation, but I could make an 
argument that it belongs in the top three, as it&rsquo;s been maddeningly 
consistent for more than a decade with its subtle Southern charm.<br>
<br>
<br>

<br> PHIL: The short answer to the first question is no. The show isn&rsquo;t 
what it once was. That being said, it&rsquo;s still one of the better shows on 
television. And you never know. It could be again at some point with the right 
writers. After all, the movie was pretty good.<br>
<br>
 &ldquo;South 
Park&rdquo; has certainly surpassed &ldquo;The Simpsons&rdquo; at this point, 
by a fairly wide margin. However, &ldquo;South Park&rdquo; might just be the 
best show on television now, so that&rsquo;s not much of a slight. &ldquo;King 
of the Hill&rdquo; is always underrated, but if I had to pick a new episode to 
watch, I&rsquo;ll still take &ldquo;The Simpsons.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
 The worst 
thing right now, for me, is seeing a younger generation flock toward the 
detestable &ldquo;Family Guy,&rdquo; which could never hold a candle to any 
season of &ldquo;The Simpsons.&rdquo; There are kids out there who actually 
think &ldquo;The Simpsons&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t funny, while &ldquo;Family 
Guy&rdquo; is the most hilarious thing they&rsquo;ve ever seen.<br>
<br>
 I 
couldn&rsquo;t tell you why. Constantly making random references that half of 
the audience doesn&rsquo;t get? One-dimensional characters? Horrible animation? 
I don&rsquo;t get it. But a lot of people do, even those who I think (usually) 
have a good sense of humor. &ldquo;Family Guy&rdquo; has fooled millions.<br>

<br> So, by all means, Simpsons, don&rsquo;t make us leave Springfield anytime 
soon. We still need you.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
 Night &amp; Day&rsquo;s 
&ldquo;Simpsons&rdquo; buffs, Phil Dzikiy and Paul Lane, go through some of 
their bests &ndash; and worsts &mdash; from the series here.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

 Top five episodes<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
 PHIL:<br>
<br>
 1. &ldquo;Lisa the 
Vegetarian&rdquo; &mdash; Equally hilarious, touching and satirical, 
&ldquo;Lisa the Vegetarian&rdquo; is still probably my favorite episode after 
all these years. Sure, the Paul and Linda McCartney thing is a little forced at 
the end, but the character development and storytelling is perfect. And the 
propaganda film &ldquo;Meat and You: Partners in Freedom&rdquo; is Troy 
McClure&rsquo;s second-finest hour on the show. Plus, you&rsquo;ve got the 
Flanders family reunion and the visit to Storytown Village.<br>
<br>
 Top it 
all off with a classic family sing-along. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t win friends 
with salad!&rdquo; To quote a classic Homer line, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s funny 
because it&rsquo;s true.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
 2. &ldquo;The Itchy &amp; Scratchy 
&amp; Poochie Show&rdquo; &mdash; Likely one of the most well-known 
&ldquo;Simpsons&rdquo; episodes, wherein new characters are inserted to the 
&ldquo;Itchy and Scratchy Show&rdquo; to fix sagging ratings. But who would 
voice &ldquo;Poochie,&rdquo; the &ldquo;kung-fu hippie from Gangsta 
City?&rdquo; Homer, of course.<br>
<br>
 Poking fun at television and 
&ldquo;The Simpsons&rdquo; itself, this episode was a satirical high point. It 
also had one of the funniest &ldquo;Simpsons&rdquo; moments ever &mdash; 
Poochie&rsquo;s inevitable demise.<br>
<br>
 3. &ldquo;Last Exit to 
Springfield&rdquo; &mdash; Widely regarded as one of the best 
&ldquo;Simpsons&rdquo; episodes for a reason, &ldquo;Last Exit to 
Springfield&rdquo; sees the show firing on all cylinders. The power plant goes 
on strike and Homer finds himself heading up the union, fighting for a new 
contract with a dental plan. Homer is at his best when he&rsquo;s a dimwitted 
but devoted father who means well, not when he&rsquo;s the selfish jerk 
he&rsquo;s written as in some later episodes.<br>
<br>
 4. &ldquo;A Fish Called 
Selma&rdquo; &mdash; If you can&rsquo;t laugh at a &ldquo;Planet of the 
Apes&rdquo; musical, called &ldquo;Stop the Planet of the Apes, I Want to Get 
Off!&rdquo; ... well, forget you. It&rsquo;s one of the most hilariously 
inspired moments in show history. This episode also shows one of &ldquo;The 
Simpsons&rsquo; &rdquo; main strengths &mdash; even secondary and peripheral 
characters could carry a great episode. The writing and characters were that 
good.<br>
<br>
 5. &ldquo;Bart the Lover&rdquo; &mdash; An old, overlooked gem. 
Bart leads along his lonely teacher, Edna Krabappel, with fake love letters 
from &ldquo;Woodrow,&rdquo; who is represented by a picture of NHL great Gordie 
Howe. This leads to poor Edna being stood up by her mystery man.<br>
<br>
 When 
Bart realizes his faux pas, he and his family gather to write a parting letter 
that will heal Krabappel&rsquo;s wounded heart. One of the sweetest episodes 
for sure, and of course, very funny. &ldquo;And, oh yes ... I really hate 
yo-yos.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
 PAUL:<br>
<br>
 1. &ldquo;Homer at the 
Bat&rdquo; &mdash; Who else but Mr. Burns could buy an all-star team? Burns did 
just that, &ldquo;hiring&rdquo; nine major leaguers to play for the company 
softball team during the playoffs. Every player had his own quirks while the 
family remained at center stage, which made this episode among the fullest the 
series has ever produced. Homer + Darryl Strawberry x Ken Griffey&rsquo;s 
grotesquely swollen jaw = funny.<br>
<br>
 2. &ldquo;I Love Lisa&rdquo; &mdash; 
One of few episodes that centered around Ralph Wiggum, this show saw him 
develop a crush for Lisa after she was the only one in class to give him a 
Valentine&rsquo;s Day card. This episode had plenty of laughs and showed that 
Ralph was more than a one-line delivery device. I would choo-choo-choose this 
episode any day.<br>
<br>
 3. &ldquo;Flaming Moe&rsquo;s&rdquo; &mdash; This 
episode saw Moe rip off a homemade drink of Homer&rsquo;s and turn it into a 
multimillion dollar idea. Friendships were torn apart and then renewed, Bart 
got caught making a prank call, a &ldquo;Cheers&rdquo; reference was made and 
Aerosmith made a cameo &ndash; a definite recipe for success.<br>
<br>
 4. 
&ldquo;Homie the Clown&rdquo; &mdash; Realizing a lifelong dream after reading 
a billboard, Homer enrolled in clown college to become a Krusty imitator. A 
close replication to the real thing, he accepts one too many of the perks 
usually afforded to Krusty and becomes entrenched in the real clown&rsquo;s mob 
affairs. Aside from seeing Homer in polka-dotted pants, this episode yielded 
probably the best sequence ever: Krusty&rsquo;s betting against the Harlem 
Globetrotters in a staged basketball game, then screaming at the television as 
the Generals lose. &ldquo;Oh, I thought the Generals were due!&rdquo; Krusty 
said. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s spinning the ball on his finger! Just take it.&rdquo;
<br><br>
 5. &ldquo;The Itchy and Scratchy and Poochie Show&rdquo; &mdash; 
Aired near the end of the series&rsquo; first decade on the air, this episode 
did a fantastic of poking fun at itself while not being preachy. To revive dull 
ratings on a long-running cartoon, the animators for &ldquo;Itchy and 
Scratchy&rdquo; decided to bring on an &ldquo;edgy&rdquo; partner in Poochie 
the Rockin&rsquo; Dog. Only problem was, the audience hated him. The entrance 
and exit of hipster housemate Roy only added to the multiple layers of humor.
<br><br>
<br>
<br>
 Worst episode<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
 PHIL: Season 15&rsquo;s 
&ldquo;The Regina Monologues,&rdquo; which revolved around the Simpsons taking 
a trip to England. Out of all the bad &ldquo;The Simpsons are going to (insert 
location)!&rdquo; episodes, this one is the worst.<br>
<br>
 Two of the 
series&rsquo; worst flaws &mdash; the contrived trips to other countries and 
exceedingly shameless celebrity appearances &mdash; both rear their ugly heads 
in this terribly unfunny episode. The bit with Ian McKellen is especially 
cringe-worthy.<br>
<br>
 Sadly, this was the last &ldquo;Simpsons&rdquo; 
episode written by the great John Swartzwelder, who may have been the best 
overall &ldquo;Simpsons&rdquo; writer (and certainly the most prolific) 
throughout the show&rsquo;s run. Judging by this episode, though, maybe it was 
time for him to go.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
 PAUL: Season 12&rsquo;s &ldquo;The 
Computer Wore Menace Shoes,&rdquo; during which Homer was abducted by a secret 
group after spreading too much gossip over the Internet. He and the entire 
family end up on some island after the dog spews poisonous gas (don&rsquo;t 
ask), where they end the episode in a blissful trance and chanting about the 
benefits of &ldquo;The Island.&rdquo; Why an island? Why are they happy? 
How&rsquo;d they get back? Horrible, HORRIBLE writing.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
 
Favorite season<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
 PHIL: Upon further review, I think seasons 
five through seven are the creamiest of the crop, but I&rsquo;ll go with season 
six in a narrow victory over season seven. Though the highs were probably 
higher in season seven, you can&rsquo;t go wrong with the sixth season, which 
featured a steady stream of classic episodes: &ldquo;Bart of Darkness,&rdquo; 
&ldquo;Itchy and Scratchy Land,&rdquo; &ldquo;Lisa on Ice,&rdquo; &ldquo;Homer 
Badman,&rdquo; &ldquo;Homer the Great,&rdquo; &ldquo;Two Dozen and One 
Greyhounds,&rdquo; &ldquo;Lemon of Troy,&rdquo; &ldquo;Who Shot Mr. Burns? Part 
1&rdquo; ... throw in one of the best &ldquo;Treehouse of Horror&rdquo; 
episodes (which features my favorite Halloween segment, wherein Homer keeps 
going back in time and changing the future), and we&rsquo;ve found our champion.
<br><br>
<br>
<br>
 PAUL: This is a tough call, but I&rsquo;d have to go with 
season four, which featured the excellent &ldquo;Mr. Plow&rdquo; and 
&ldquo;Brother from the Same Planet&rdquo; episodes as well as the sweetly 
funny &ldquo;Lisa&rsquo;s First Word.&rdquo; God not knowing that the St. Louis 
Cardinals NFL franchise had relocated was good for a few chuckles, as well, in 
&ldquo;Homer the Heretic.&rdquo; A valid case could be made for any season from 
three through eight or nine, but I&rsquo;ll give four the slight edge.<br>
<br>

<br><br>
 Favorite secondary character<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
 PHIL: How hard is 
this? Secondary characters are vital to &ldquo;The Simpsons,&rdquo; moreso than 
any other show. I could make a top 100 list. But my number one choice has to be 
the incomparable Milhouse Van Houten. While others may select Ralph Wiggum (too 
one-note) or Charles Montgomery Burns (certainly worthy), &ldquo;The 
&lsquo;House&rdquo; always wins.<br>
<br>
 He&rsquo;s delivered some of the 
best quotes in series history (&rdquo;Then why did I have the bowl, Bart? Why 
did I have the bowl?&rdquo;), and he&rsquo;s a loyal best friend to Bart. His 
backstory is nuanced and often sad (divorced parents), but his character 
remains strong and underused (he&rsquo;s great in a bigger role ... watch 
&ldquo;Radioactive Man&rdquo; and &ldquo;Bart&rsquo;s Friend Falls in 
Love.&rdquo;) Everything&rsquo;s coming up Milhouse!<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
 PAUL: 
I initially thought of simpleton second-grader Ralph Wiggum, but the more I 
pondered it the more I liked Moe Szyslak. The gruff bartender seems somewhat 
underappreciated for the self-depreciating remarks he makes that are so 
off-the-wall funny, and he is just all over the place &mdash; from violence to 
compassion to apathy toward his customers&rsquo; well-being &mdash; which gives 
him a lot of depth, a bit more than Wiggum. His best moment might be when he 
tried to open a family restaurant, as his struggles to relate to children were 
triumphantly funny. No need to draw any stink lines here.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
 
Favorite guest star/one-time character<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
 PHIL: A great 
character who I&rsquo;d love to see again would be the evil genius, Hank 
Scorpio (voiced impeccably by Albert Brooks). That would be my pick. But for 
sheer silliness, I&rsquo;ll take Dr. Colossus. And as far as all-time guest 
stars go, the nod goes to the late Phil Hartman and his many memorable 
characters (Troy McClure, Lionel Hutz).<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
 PAUL: Sting was 
good as himself when he tried to rescue from the well and Danny DeVito was 
great as Homer&rsquo;s half-brother Herb Powell, but I&rsquo;d have to go with 
Adam West, who played a creepy version of himself in the &ldquo;Mr. Plow&rdquo; 
episode, doing the &ldquo;Bat-usi&rdquo; dance from his campy 
&ldquo;Batman&rdquo; series and appearing to have gone insane from the 
experience.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
 Favorite quote<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
 PHIL: There 
are thousands of worthy possibilities. But my personal pick is newsman Kent 
Brockman&rsquo;s famous jump to conclusions in &ldquo;Deep Space Homer&rdquo; 
after he sees footage of ants floating around in the space shuttle. Some of the 
ants were very close to the camera and appeared to be quite large. Take it 
away, Kent.<br>
<br>
 &ldquo;Ladies and gentlemen, uh, we&rsquo;ve just lost 
the picture, but what we&rsquo;ve seen speaks for itself. The Corvair 
spacecraft has apparently been taken over &mdash; &lsquo;conquered,&rsquo; if 
you will &mdash; by a master race of giant space ants. It&rsquo;s difficult to 
tell from this vantage point whether they will consume the captive Earth men or 
merely enslave them. One thing is for certain: There is no stopping them; the 
ants will soon be here. And I, for one, welcome our new insect overlords. 
I&rsquo;d like to remind them that as a trusted TV personality, I can be 
helpful in rounding up others to toil in their underground sugar caves.&rdquo;
<br><br>
<br>
<br>
 PAUL: Homer had a &ldquo;demovitvational plaque&rdquo; put 
up at work after he quit but had to come back, so he used pictures of Maggie to 
spell out a different message on the sign &mdash; &ldquo;Do it for her.&rdquo; 
A picture of my daughter and me on my desk says the same thing.<br>
<br>
 If 
we&rsquo;re going for funniest quote, I&rsquo;ll nominate the drunken native 
Homer was sent to help save when he became a missionary to avoid the ruthless 
people and puppets of PBS. &ldquo;How can ace be 1 AND 11?&rdquo; the native 
asked in a stupor, having just been introduced to blackjack and Christianity by 
Homer. &ldquo;What kind of god would allow that to happen?&rdquo;</p> <br>

<li> CONFER: Do yourself a favor &mdash; read newspapers 
<p> Quite often I speak to large groups &mdash; like Leadership Niagara or 
students at SUNY Brockport &mdash; about leadership skills. When discussing 
some of the more important tools for leading their organization &mdash; be it a 
business, a non-profit, a government agency, or even their household &mdash; I 
always mention that they need to read a newspaper (or a few newspapers) every 
day.</p>
