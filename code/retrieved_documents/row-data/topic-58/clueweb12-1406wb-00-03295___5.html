 I like both of them equally. I do have 
to say, though, that it depends on my mood; if I feel intellectual then I'll 
watch The Simpsons, and if I feel like a little immature laughs I'll go for 
Family Guy.<br>

 I'll admit I like neither of 
them, still I've seen bits of episodes and if I was forced to I think I'd 
choose Simpsons over Family Guy<br>

 Hm, against the whim of the wind, I would have to say I prefer 
Family Guy over the Simpsons.&nbsp; Family guy is just more hilariously random, 
in my opinion.&nbsp; I love the randomness of it.&nbsp; You sort of have to be 
a geek to understand some of the content, however, and I am not ashamed to 
admit myself as somewhat of a nerd.&nbsp; Robot Chicken, as well, is 
spontaneously amusing, and I find it enjoyable as well, but I have to say 
Family Guy takes the cake.<br>
<br>
Maybe I am just a nonconformist.&nbsp; I 
don't know. <br>

comes... I wish to be one of those people.<br>

 Simpsons, in

so random.. Jeez, it is hilarious!<br>

 I'm with Chaosmancer, <br>
I won't allow my kids or 
husband to look at them. The simpsons, if a kid can insult, put down and make 
his dad the butt to entertainment, that's pathatic.<br>
The Family Guy, any 
toddler that has the voice of a man, masterbates &amp; suckles tit and is 
protrated as a toddler is just plain sick. <br>

 fiery words, my friend Dandelion.&nbsp; In all 
honesty, I believe that the children are going to see those things on the 
street anyhow. Maybe it's just where I come from.&nbsp; But I guess you are 
right to shield your family from these things.<br>

Re: The Simpsons

 @Dark_Death they do see things in public, but we 
talk about sex openly, we show affection in front of the kids, hugs, kisses and 
social exceptance and I think those two shows set the wrong example and bad 
impression.<br>
Rather than saying you aren't watching that, I say to them, I 
would like for you not to watch those shows, they set a bad example.<br>
Now 
you are old enough to be able to desifer the comics, but a tweleve year old 
watching it with her dad and then him finding humor, it's the wrong kind of 
influence.<br>
It's like telling them, do as I say not as I do. When I took TV 
away from the kids, I didn't sit and watch it in front of them. The whole house 
went without TV. The family unit is that, a team, a unit. Leave no man behind. 
If you screw up, everybody pays. Reward large, but purnishments should match 
the crime.<br>
I mean no harm and hope that no one takes me the wrong way. 
Thank you for pointing out how harsh I was in my judgement. I really shouldn't 
have left it hanging out there like that without explaining myself and I 
promise you and everybody that I will be more careful from now on. Forgive 
me?....Please.... :oops: <br>

Re: The Simpsons vs Family Guy

 I'll forgive you, but I also agree with you. American 
television seems to be devolving, and I've never found those shows very funny. 
More disturbing really. Maybe that's why I love anime so much, the story lines 
are great and if there is sexual content or bad language, it's much more 
tastefully displayed in my opinion.<br>
