&nbsp; 
<p>If there was ever an animated series that should have been saved from 
cancellation, it had to be &ldquo;Family Guy.&rdquo; Being a person who has 
always felt that any form of support for political correctness was for the 
&lsquo;intellectually challenged,&rsquo; &ldquo;Family Guy&rdquo; consistently 
struck me as one of the funniest of the prime time animated series. It combined 
the rapid-fire editing of the &ldquo;Simpsons&rdquo; with the taboo humor of 
&ldquo;South Park&rdquo; and delivered a constant barrage of laughs. No topic 
was too controversial, no joke to perverse.<br>
<br>
 Just to give you an 
example&hellip; the first episodes of the third season alone, &ldquo;The Thin 
White Line&rdquo;, poked fun at drug abuse, pregnant teenagers, people in 
wheelchairs and Charles Manson. And that&rsquo;s just the tip of the iceberg. I 
mean really, isn&rsquo;t kind of funny to sneak into a pregnant teen center and 
put all of girl&rsquo;s hands into bowls of water while they&rsquo;re sleeping? 
Well&hellip; uhh&hellip; isn&rsquo;t it?<br>
<br>
</p> <br>
<br>

<p>&ldquo;Family Guy,&rdquo; unfortunately succumbed to low ratings after its 
third season of being pushed around to different time slots and constant 
preemptions. Basically, it got the same type of treatment from Fox that 
eventually killed &ldquo;Futurama.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
 On the brighter side, Fox 
did finally make a good decision in releasing &ldquo;Family Guy&rdquo; on to 
the DVD market. They had previously released &ldquo;Volume 1&rdquo;, which 
included the 1st and 2nd seasons and &ldquo;Volume 2&rdquo;, which had the 
third and final season.<br>
<br>
 After the release of that 2nd volume, 
&ldquo;Family Guy&rdquo; fans such as myself figured we had seen the last of 
Peter Griffin, his wife Lois and his three adorable children, Meg, Chris and 
little Stewie. But then something wonderful happened. The sales of these DVD 
sets were astronomical and somehow convinced the &lsquo;suits&rsquo; at Fox 
that there was an opportunity to make even more money off of the Griffin 
family. So, in an unprecedented move, the studio decided to bring back the 
previously cancelled show, much to the delight of audiences everywhere.<br>
<br>
 &ldquo;Family Guy,&rdquo; re-premiered in May of 2005, and immediately made 
fun of the studios decision to cancel it in the first place. The very first 
scene shows Peter standing in front of his family and talking about how long of 
a summer it had been, but goes on to say how wonderful it was to have sooo many 
terrific shows to watch. He then proceeds to name off every failed series that 
Fox had aired in their time slot since the cancellation.<br>
<br>
 This new 
season brought with it the opportunity to see just how much more offensive it 
could get without being edited. I can hardly begin to describe some of the best 
(worst?) of the jokes, but if you think it is impossible to get any more 
offensive than playing &ldquo;Catch the Greased-Up Deaf Guy&rdquo;, you 
couldn&rsquo;t be more wrong.<br>
 In the aftermath of the re-premiere of 
&ldquo;Family Guy,&rdquo; we&rsquo;re also finding that we have an all-new 
&ldquo;Volume 4&rdquo; DVD set to get our grubby little hands on. (Volume 3 
came out a few months back.) It contains all 14 of the episodes from the second 
half of the show&rsquo;s 4th season&rsquo;. and just as &quot;The 
Simpsons&quot; has big stars fighting to do voiceover work, this handful of 
episodes includes 'appearances' from the likes of Robert Downey Jr., Charles 
Durning, Frank Sinatra Jr., Wallace Shawn, Carrie Fisher, Will Sasso, Bob 
Barker, Sherman Helmsley, Marion Ross, Tom Bosley, Paula Abdul, Jay Leno, Carol 
Channing, Bob Costas, Pat Sajak, Alex Trebek, Carrot Top, Bryan Cranston, Adam 
Carolla, Betty White, and Michael Clarke Duncan.<br>
<br>
 But while this new 
set may have fewer episodes than some of the previous sets, there are still a 
ton of extra features, every bit as funny as the series itself. Every single 
episode has commentary with Seth McFarlane, who is joined on and off by just 
about everyone who ever had anything to do with the series. The commentaries 
are informative, but even more important&hellip; they're entertaining. The 
jokes fly fast and furious between this group of highly talented people.<br>

<br> There are also multi angle comparisons for scenes from four of the 
episodes, which give you the opportunity to see how the original storyboards 
looked. Plus you'll find a 14 minute behind the scenes featurette that allows 
McFarlane and some of his other directors to show us how an animation director 
does his job, a short visit with artist Peter Shin who shows us how to draw 
Stewie, and a look at the &quot;Family Guy&quot; offices as actor Adam West is 
given a tour. Additionally there are about 43 deleted scenes from the season 
and some animatics that can be accessed from your DVD-Rom. Not bad for a 
'cancelled' series.<br>
<br>
 &ldquo;Family Guy&rdquo; is not for everyone, but 
it should be. We live in an age of ridiculously defended political correctness 
where people are afraid to make fun of anything. This show is refreshing in its 
gleeful attempts to tick off everyone on the planet. I honestly don&rsquo;t 
think I&rsquo;ve ever laughed so hard and so long at the expense of others. And 
to prove that it is directed at the intellectuals amongst us, what other show 
can give you MC Escher, Music Man, and Kool-Aid commercial references? Only the 
best and the brightest will catch them all.</p>
