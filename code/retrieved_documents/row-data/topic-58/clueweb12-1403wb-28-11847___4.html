<p>I have liked every show so far this season and this is no exception. This 
season has really improved in the writing and funniness of episodes. The bop-it 
sequence was priceless. the story was intriguing and really entertaining. 5/5. 
Glad to see the viewer ship staying up.</p> Reply <br>

<p>The story was really good. Overall, a great episode. I thought it was funny 
how two of the act breaks showed someone about to die. Homer and the grenade 
and chief Wiggum about to shoot himself in the face.</p> Reply <br>

<p>I am really exited! I notice this time the writers are coming up with 
ideas, and not just recycling. Kudos</p> Reply <br>

<p>Fox_Executive, no, you&rsquo;re wrong. Anyway, it should be noted that the 
19-49 demo of the simpsons (4.2) was not as high as Family guy&rsquo;s (4.4)</p>

<p>This episode was not bad. Great couch gag even though i thought last weeks 
was better.<br>
 I can&rsquo;t wait for the next episode. Good ratings too.</p>

<p>Thought the first act was great especially the Bambi part. But, the rest 
just wasn&rsquo;t that good in my opinion. I&rsquo;d say 2.5/5 stars.</p> Reply

<p>My fave episode was Lisa the Drama Queen and this one is right up there 
with it. I love how Lisa is so smart, is a vegitarian, cares about the world 
and is now starting to embrace magic. Lisa Lovers Unite!</p> Reply <br>

<p>Don&rsquo;t understand the ratings, more unpredictable than, well, Wigan 
(football reference there, I couldn&rsquo;t think of owt else). But 
y&rsquo;know, if its getting good ratings, this is always good news.</p> 
<p>And if its a good episode, that also helps too.</p> Reply <br>

<p>Brilliant episode! I especially loved first part of the episode, but plot 
and ending were rather nice.</p> 
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that it&rsquo;s bad because we have modern animation in 
the show, like in the Simpsons Movie. First few minutes really reminded me of 
the Alaska part of the Movie, which was my favorite. Hope that other Christmas 
time episodes will also have lovely scenes like this episode.</p> 
<p>Also hope that rates will maintain stable in the future. I don&rsquo;t 
expect some enormously big number (over 10 million), I hope that it will stay 
round 9 millions.</p> Reply <br>

<p>I hope that The Simpsons goes back to the glory years when it got 12 
million or at least it becomes moreviewed than Family Guy although I think 
Family Guy is funny. I hope they create a spin-off</p> Reply <br>
