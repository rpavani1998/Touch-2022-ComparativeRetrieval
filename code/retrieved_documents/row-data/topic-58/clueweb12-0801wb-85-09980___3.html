 Other. <br>
I watch it for the same reason that I 
would watch a talk show, in that it comments on social issues and current 
events and can be quite funny at times. That's why shows like that can last so 
long; they aren't plot or narrative based, but expand, grow, and change as our 
own culture does.<br>
The last few episodes that I've seen have been pretty 
good.<br>

<br>  well, the thing about the simpsons is it didn't used to coast on pop 
culture references, at least not that I remember. The characters were very well 
developed and never faltered, and the stories felt relatively realistic, and 
were often just as sweet as they were funny. Now, it's just like they're trying 
to be like family guy and crank out anything that'll get a laugh. The 
characters don't feel like the same people, and it makes me sad, because I 
really liked the characters. <br>
I'll agree they have an okay episode or two 
every now and again, but in my opinion it doesn't feel like the same show, and 
it isn't anywhere near as good as it used to be.<br>

 It did used to 
coast on pop culture references... They were just waaay before our time, so 
they mostly went over our heads :&gt;<br>
Maybe that's the secret of pop 
culture references. They become dated, but so much so that they eventually seem 
original again <br>
<br>
I will agree that it has lost a lot of its character 
consistency/appeal. Unfortunately that happens to the best of shows. I would 
have liked to see it scrapped, just in the interest of letting a new premise 
breathe, but then 'Allen Gregory' aired and I decided maybe I'd rather have the 
Simpsons stick around after all <br>
Adult animation is a niche' market, and 
unfortunately it's very hard nowadays to find stations that will market 
highbrow writing within it. The Simpsons is probably as close as we're going to 
get.<br>
<br>
Actually, if you haven't seen all of the episodes I'd highly 
reccommend that you watch Futurama. That is definitely my favorite.<br>
<br>

Oh, and your Christmas present should be at the PO Box by the beginning of 
December <br>

 I feel like it didn't used to be to the same extent though... a lot 
of the stories were based around actual life situations. Maybe you're right, 
maybe I just didn't notice it as much.<br>
I've seen a few episodes of 
Futurama, it's hilarious! I've been meaning to watch more of it, but cricket is 
stupid and I can't use netflix until we get better internet. <br>
Yeah, I saw 
the first few minutes of Allen Gregory. Not that I was expecting anything good 
to begin with, but after a few minutes I couldn't even leave it on as a 
background distraction.<br>
No way no way no way! Damn it I still need to send 
you yours! <br>

 Same with me. I tried to watch the pilot, and I got about halfway 
through it before I decided that it was only ever going to be a huge waste of 
my time, haha.<br>
OH I GOT THE ORDER SHIPMENT CONFIRMATION TODAY <br>
It 
should be there in a couple of days!<br>

polls....all but the one on Sept 26th, but you can file that under &quot;guilty 
conscience&quot;) <br>

 haha, resist! resist! <br>
<br>
I will try to keep 
it up! most of the time my poll inspiration comes from sleep deprivation or a 
semi food coma.<br>
<br>
Don't you hate that? Sometimes I'll have a good idea 
and 'poof', it's gone. <br>
I'm sure you'll think of something eventually! When 
in doubt, just say something that makes absolutely no sense. <br>
