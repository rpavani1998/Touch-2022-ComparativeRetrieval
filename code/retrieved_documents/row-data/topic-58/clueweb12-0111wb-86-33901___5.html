<b> The Simpsons</b> &nbsp; <br>
<br>

<blockquote> <br>
Can life get any better for Homer J. Simpson? He juggles the 
roles of husband, father, safety inspector at the Springfield Nuclear Power 
Plant, bowler, beer drinker, astronaut, small business owner and dreamer, and 
makes it all look easy. But it wasn't always so easy for Homer J. Raised by his 
father, Abe, who tried to compensate for the absence of Homer's radical hippie 
mother, Homer graduated at the bottom of his high school class and managed to 
earn the distinction of being the longest-term entry-level employee at the 
plant. Together with his high school sweetheart, Marge Bouvier, Homer settled 
down in Evergreen Terrace, the nicest upper-lower-middle class section of 
Springfield, to raise his three precious children. Homer is fond of Duff Beer, 
donuts, Marge's pork chops and watching the Bee Guy on the Spanish channel. His 
dislikes include his boss, Mr. Burns, yard work and his neighbor, Ned Flanders.

 Bart Simpson is misunderstood. Wrongly pegged as an underachiever 
and troublemaker, Bart would like to remind the world of some of his decent 
qualities: He looks out for his sister, Lisa; he's befriended outcasts and 
misfits like Milhouse Van Houten and Ralph Wiggum; he's injected romance into 
the life of his teacher, Edna Krabappel; and he brought down an illegal French 
winery during his brief semester abroad. So what if he's also befouled the 
Springfield Community Church with phony hymns or prank-called Moe's Tavern 
several times a day for the last few years? It all balances out, right? At age 
10, Bart has managed to live out a number of dreams: He has starred in his own 
short-lived TV series (with his idol, Krusty the Clown), spotted and named a 
deadly comet that nearly destroyed his town, and almost snagged the role of 
Fallout Boy in the Radioactive Man movie. He couldn't have done any of those 
things without the help and support of his best friend, Santa's Little Helper.

 Lisa Simpson can't wait for college. She's only 8 and already reads 
at a 14th grade level, and has written a number of application-quality essays, 
one of which won her family a free trip to Washington, D.C. Her favorite 
activities include playing her saxophone, attending school and reading 
Non-Threatening Boys Magazine. A fan of Malibu Stacy, Lisa tried unsuccessfully 
to create her own talking doll, Lisa Lionheart. Unfortunately, no one wanted to 
buy a talking doll that was as judgmental as Lisa. Lisa wants everyone to know 
that she is a vegetarian and that if she could have one thing (besides world 
peace), it would be a pony.<br>

 Matt Groening changed television forever 
when he brought animation back to primetime with this immortal nuclear family. 
He is also creator and executive producer of the FOX animated series Futurama. 
Originally brought to life in 1987 for FOX's Emmy Award-winning series The 
Tracey Ullman Show, The Simpsons was Groening's introduction into the animation 
world. Previously, he was best known for his &quot;Life in Hell&quot; cartoon 
strip, an irreverent portrayal of broken life that debuted in 1977 and 
currently appears in more than 250 newspapers worldwide. In 1993 he formed 
Bongo Comic Group, whereby he serves as publisher over the following: 
&quot;Simpsons Comics,&quot; Itchy &amp; Scratchy Comics, Bartman, Radioactive 
Man, Lisa Comics and Krusty Comics. In 1995 he founded and published 
&quot;Zongo Comics,&quot; which included Jimbo and Fleener. In addition to 
producing his weekly strip, keeping on top of the ongoing production demands of 
the weekly television series, and meeting regularly with the Bongo team, 
Groening oversees all aspects of the licensing and merchandising of The 
Simpsons. In addition to the recent best-seller The Simpsons: A Complete Guide 
to Our Favorite Family, Groening's books, based on &quot;Life in Hell&quot; and 
The Simpsons include Love Is Hell, Work is Hell, School is Hell, The Big Book 
of Hell, Akbar &amp; Jeff's Guide to Life, Love is Hell 10th Anniversary 
Edition, Binky's Guide to Love, The Simpsons Xmas Book, The Simpsons Rainy Day 
Fun Book, Making Faces With the Simpsons, Bart Simpson's Guide To Life, The 
Simpsons' Uncensored Family Album, Cartooning With The Simpsons, Simpsons 
Illustrated magazine, Simpson Comics &amp; Stories comic book, Simpsons Comics 
Extravaganza, Simpsons Comics Spectacular, Bartman: The Best of The Best, and 
Simpsons Comics Simps-O-Rama. Groening, a native of Portland, Oregon, resides 
in Los Angeles. <br>
