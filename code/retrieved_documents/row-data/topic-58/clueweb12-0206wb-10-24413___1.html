<p>Let the controversy begin -- <em>Best Life</em> Magazine named Honolulu #1 
on its list of &quot;The 100 Best Places to Raise a Family&quot;, while Flint, 
Michigan scrapes the bottom. Where does your city rank?</p> 
<p>&quot;Television executives seized the idea long ago: American families 
value where they plant their roots. The Cosbys had Brooklyn. The Cunninghams, 
Milwaukee. The Simpsons, Springfield.</p> 
<p>But fathers face reality when they're not in prime time. They want to raise 
their children somewhere safe, where they can attend good schools with 
favorable student-teacher ratios, above-average test scores, and respectable 
budgets. Plenty of museums, parks, and pediatricians also contribute to a good 
quality of life, whereas multihour commutes, expensive houses, and divorcing 
friends and neighbors do not. Best Life editors used these categories and data 
from the U.S. Census Bureau, National Center for Education Statistics, FBI, 
American Association of Museums, National Center for Health Statistics, and 
American Bar Association to evaluate 257 cities.&quot;</p> 
<p>Virginia Beach, Virginia and Billings, Montana rank high with Honolulu, 
while Dayton, Ohio and Waco, Texas join Flint at the bottom of the heap.</p>

<h3>a plug for my most livable cities site </h3>  Submitted by Michael Lewyn

<p>- No doubt flawed, but no more so than anyone else's. Basically looks at 
crime rates, percent of people walking to work, and transit use.</p>

<h3>Statistics and numbers in</h3>  Submitted by ChevyChaseDC on Thu,

<p>Statistics and numbers in general are abused here as they are too often 
elsewhere. Philadelphia International Airport was just ranked by JD Power and 
Associates as &quot;#1 in Customer Satisfaction,&quot; which is a laughable 
notion to locals. All these lists and rankings are really about the underlying 
goals and objectives (i.e., the agenda) of those who publish the lists. 
Business magazines might use criteria related to taxes and regulation to show 
that Houston is better than Portland, while environmentally-minded or 
progressive publications might use such criteria as number of parks, the 
presence of bike trails, recycling programs, etc., to show the opposite. The 
cherry-picking that allows certain un-named authors and posters to paint 
spending tax dollars on public infrastructure as a wasteful boondoggle 
(especially if it's related to mass transit) is the same type of selective use 
of statistics to prove that Honolulu is the best place to raise a family. But 
wait a sec...what if the authors included &quot;danger from volcanic 
eruptions&quot; or &quot;danger from earthquakes&quot; as criteria? That might 
change things just a bit. I'll throw one out there - the 'ten most 
architecturally significant U.S. cities.' What should those criteria be? 
Density of buildings designed by famous architects? Number of buildings over 
500'? Concentration of brick rowhomes? Art-deco facades? Billboards, gas 
stations, and fast food shacks?</p>

<h3>Yet another &quot;top 100 lists&quot;</h3>  Submitted by CincyPlanner on 
Wed, 05/21/2008 - 12:11.<br>

<p>Is anyone else tired of these unscientific and poorly scaled lists that 
this magazine and others publish? I love how control factors such as population 
or metro area size aren't reflected in these lists. I could make a huge list of 
assumptions and conditions these lists lack to tell the reader about. I'd love 
to desect the author's methodology and see just what goes into these rankings.

<h3>What methodology?...</h3>  Submitted by MightyMOplanner on Fri, 05/23/2008

<p>Obviously, we need to &quot;consider the source&quot; when viewing 
ridiculous &quot;Top 100&quot; lists such as this. I doubt any reasonable 
amount of scientifc methodology was utilized in this slap-dash patchwork of 
&quot;best places.&quot; Witness: Las Vegas ranked higher than Portland 
(Oregon), Seattle, Denver, and Kansas City (MO &amp; KS)?? Are legalized 
prostitution, widespread gambling, the highest foreclosure rate in the nation, 
and quickie divorces a positive environment in which to raise a family? 
Apparently so...</p>
