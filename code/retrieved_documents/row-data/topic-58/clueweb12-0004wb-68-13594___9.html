<title>Monadology: Family Guy Sucks</title>

<h2>Family Guy Sucks</h2> 
<h3>June 2, 2008</h3> 
<h3>by Nate</h3> 
<p>I was horrified by <em>South Park</em> when it came on the air. I still 
find many episodes too disgusting to watch, and a significant amount of the 
humor is just dumb. But I must admit to having been wooed over the years by the 
sardonic vision of Parker and Stone. I suppose it&rsquo;s the unrepentant 
preachiness that attracted my notice first. (Whole plot points are devoted to 
letting characters say something repeatedly that has a literal meaning in the 
story and a more obvious contextual meaning outside it. Example: in one 
episode, police have to negotiate with Tom Cruise to come out of hiding in the 
closet of Stan Marsh&rsquo;s room. I can&rsquo;t count the number of times they 
were able to have characters say, &ldquo;Tom Cruise, come out of the 
closet!&rdquo;) For me, this endless succession of bones to pick and axes to 
grind makes the show&rsquo;s stories much more interesting than they would 
otherwise be. And, frankly, I think the show&rsquo;s kept up its quality (such 
as it is) remarkably well over the years.</p> 
<p>It was a pleasure, then, to watch <em>The Cartoon Wars</em> episodes 
recently and have them skewer<em>The Family Guy</em> so beautifully, a show 
about which I cannot say enough ill. You can get an excellentsummary of their 
criticisms here, or just go watch those episodes.</p> <br>

<p>I would add that I find Cartman to be an essentially successful character: 
he&rsquo;s evil in a consistent, terrible, wonderful way. His tremendous 
selfishness, his fantastic prowess at manipulation, and his simultaneous 
childishness are a combination that Parker and Stone clearly understand enough 
to preserve.</p> 
<p>Contrast this to Homer Simpson, who has evolved from a deeply sympathetic 
everyman who was excessive in every one of his natural inclinations (including 
good ones) to a vacuous fiction of a character, a foil who does stupid or 
selfish things to create obstacles and advance plots, rather than one who often 
reacts in instinctively stupid or selfish ways to things in the world. He has, 
sadly, followed in the steps of Peter Griffin, a man who is simply and blankly 
monstrous.</p>

<p>South Park can be really gross, but the preachy episodes make it worth it. 
There are three elements to every episode: little kids wacky adventure, 
heavyhanded preachy metaphor, esoteric or closely observed parody, with some 
episodes more purely one of the three. The first episode about the alien anal 
probes isn&rsquo;t about anything, but as time has gone on they&rsquo;ve 
started to say more and more interesting things.</p> 
<p>A couple episodes have stayed with me as templates for my thinking. 
Sometimes I just disagree with TP &amp; MS&rsquo; politics/beliefs, like with 
the Al Gore ManBearPig episode. Sometimes their take is so contrarian that it 
makes you glad contrarians exist (the &ldquo;Bloody Mary&rdquo; episode has an 
interesting take on alcoholism[1]). I used Cartman as an example in a paper on 
Hegel&rsquo;s Philosophy of Right: (He tells Butters, &ldquo;Life goes by 
pretty fast. If you don&rsquo;t stop and look around once and a while, and do 
whatever you want all the time, you could miss it&rdquo; but he also likes 
authori-teh).</p> 
<p>Mainly what they offer is a genuinely skeptical/cynical perspective on 
everything, something that&rsquo;s not at all common in modernity. It&rsquo;s 
not even Libertarian, because they believe that most people are idiots. The 
&ldquo;Free Willzyx&rdquo; episode [2] strikes me as a sort of summation of 
their philosophical position, which is against sentimentalism of any stripe.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t watched The Simpsons in a long time, but SP and it started 
out the same, both with bad animation and SP with &ldquo;kick the baby!&rdquo; 
and Simpsons with Homer strangling Bart, and both moved to more complex satire. 
An episode I saw recently [3] was pretty clever in many ways.</p>

<p>Mr. Method,</p> 
<p>Your description matches my experience of South Park perfectly. Your 
analysis of episode mechanics, in particular, strikes me as correct. I&rsquo;m 
also glad you reminded me of their take on alcoholism: it<em>was</em> unusual 
and delightful to have someone criticize the idea that alcoholism is a disease. 
I wasn&rsquo;t particularly convinced, but it made me immediately grateful for 
the dialectical space it created.</p> 
<p>I don&rsquo;t think, though, that Homer strangling Bart is the equivalent 
of &ldquo;kick the baby&rdquo;. Homer strangling Bart was (aside from a good 
sight gag) a demonstration of Homer&rsquo;s inability to restrain his impulses. 
Since, at the beginning, he was still something of a father, who might be 
annoyed by the childishness of his son or even by his son&rsquo;s failure to 
behave, it was a good demonstration of how Homer in some ways<em>fit</em> his 
role of father, but lacked the moderation or maturity to behave as<em>he</em> 
was supposed to. This is a compelling picture, in my opinion, where many of us 
feel fundamentally unsuited (or at least occasionally unsuited) to the roles we 
must play, as much as we frequently are grateful for them, too. That 
Homer&rsquo;s inability to parent more effectively is essentially parallel to 
Bart&rsquo;s failure to be a good kid is, of course, obvious to us and part of 
the cleverness of it.</p> 
<p>All this is to say that I consider it part of the sophisticated character 
structures that informed stories and interactions in the early years. I&rsquo;d 
take any of those episodes in a second over the satire of episodes like 
&ldquo;That &rsquo;90s Show&rdquo;, where the characters are unimportant, and 
exist merely to serve up a sm&ouml;rg&aring;sbord of (admittedly decent) 
cultural references and jokes.</p>

<p>Nate,</p> 
<p>I think if you go back and watch those episodes from the first season, 
you&rsquo;ll see that everything is very crude and direct, like a cartoon 
version of Married with Children. Homer looks and sounds like a dangerous 
monster. The lines wobble and the sight gag of Bart&rsquo;s head 
&lsquo;squishing&rsquo; up when Homer strangles him is common (Homer strangles 
him whenever he realizes that Bart is making fun of him: &ldquo;Why you 
little&hellip;&rdquo;). Then, as Groening et al. figure out the medium, 
everything slows down, the animation gets cleaner and the focus shifts to the 
complex three-act stories with all the cultural references. I think this was 
Groening making the successful show more like his comic books, which are fairly 
intellectual. A few seasons in there&rsquo;s an episode making fun of the early 
&ldquo;Eat my shorts, man!&rdquo; phase of the Simpsons, and I recall a scene 
in a more recent episode where Homer strangles Bart but it&rsquo;s clearly an 
ironic reference back to that time. Then, the Simpsons has had to transition 
from a creative labor of love to a social institution, like Saturday Night 
Live. An episode like &ldquo;that 90s show&rdquo; is extremely self-aware and 
post-, since of course the 90s was a decade that the Simpsons helped to define, 
and the writers know that (the episode begins the same way as another popular 
episode where we see Marge and Homer in the 70s). Look out for &ldquo;that 
Oughts Show&rdquo; in 2010.</p> 
<p>The Nirvana and Bush references in that episode are really funny: 
&ldquo;Margarine!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I concur with most of the prior posts. Family Guy has some okay moments 
(mostly from the earlier seasons) but the style of humor presented is sometimes 
lazy, as when they break in with the live action musical performances or use 
excessive flatulence. But the most irritating aspect of the show is their 
blatant plagiarism of The Simpsons, as when Stewie uses extended arm skin flaps 
to glide in the sky - a feat that was carried out by &ldquo;old Jewish 
man&rdquo; (2 years before) during the olympic games for the elderly when he 
leaped from the high-dive board.<br>
 It is one thing to borrow and make it 
your own with distinguishable flare, and another to just steal without adding 
anything progressive.The writers count on the youth of their fan base to get 
away with this fraud.<br>
