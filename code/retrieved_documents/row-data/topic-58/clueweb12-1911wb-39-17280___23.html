genres: cutaway gag humor, black comedy, off-color humor, surreal humor and 
slapstick. The format of the show is animated sitcom and the creator is Seth 
MacFarlane. Family Guy was developed by its creator and by David Zuckerman. The 
voices of the characters of Family Guy are those of Seth MacFarlane, Alex

<h2>  Family Guy the &ldquo;Road to&hellip;&rdquo; Episodes </h2> 
<p> Filed under: Family Guy - 18 Mar 2012 &nbsp;|&nbsp;Spread the word ! </p> 
<br> 
<p>The Family Guy is an animated television series, which focuses on a variety 
of humorous situations and amusing gags. Some of the episodes that have been 
aired form the Family Guy are based on traveling &ndash;&nbsp;the &ldquo;Road 
to&hellip;&rdquo; episodes. The idea of these themed episodes originates from 
the<em>Road to&hellip; </em>films, with Dorothy Lamour, Bing Crosby and Bob 
Hope. They come as a parody of these classical comedies. The Family Guy 
episodes take the idea of the &ldquo;Road to&hellip;&rdquo; a bit further, 
placing Stewie and Brian in some peculiar locations, even supernatural and 
virtual spaces. In order to keep the ironic view of the classical productions 
in Family Guy, there are musical numbers and special openings included.&nbsp;
</p> 
<p>These Family Guy episodes have a typical segmented formation: cultural 
references and the reason why Stewie and Brain must leave home; the traveling 
experience and solving the problem; the struggle to return home and to restore 
normality. The first Family Guy &ldquo;Road to&hellip;&rdquo; episode was 
released in May, 2000. Dan Povenmire, who would also direct the following two 
themed episodes of this kind, directed the &ldquo;Road to Rhode Island&rdquo;, 
the first one to air from this category. Next, the &ldquo;Road to Europe&rdquo; 
appeared, in February, 2002. The third themed episode was the &ldquo;Road to 
Rupert&rdquo;, which appeared in January, 2007. Greg Colton directed the 
following three episodes of the &ldquo;Road to&hellip;&rdquo; series from 
Family Guy. The &ldquo;Road to Germany&rdquo; episode aired in October 2008. 
The following year, in September, The &ldquo;Road to the Multiverse&rdquo; came 
out. Lastly, in December, 2010, the &ldquo;Road to the North Pole&rdquo; was 
released.</p> 
<p>The Family Guy is one of the most appreciated television productions today. 
It is hard to find something that still makes people laugh after the numerous 
shows that have been produced so far. The Family Guy has even more to take on, 
as the series is animated and this is a major risk to take with the audiences 
that have formed a certain taste in comedy productions. Even so and after many 
controversies, the Family Guy managed to win the hearts and the attention of 
many people.</p>  (No Ratings Yet) <br>

<h2>  Criticism and Controversy Over Family Guy </h2> 
<p> Filed under: Family Guy - 13 Feb 2012 &nbsp;|&nbsp;Spread the word ! </p> 
<br> 
<p>Family Guy is perhaps the best know animated TV series, created by Seth 
MacFarlane for the Fox Broadcasting Company. The Family Guy series centers on 
the Griffins, a dysfunctional family, consisting of parents Peter and Lois, 
their children Meg, Chris and Stewie, and their anthropomorphic pet dog Brian. 
The show is set in the fictional city of Quahog, Rhode Island, and exhibits 
much of the humor of cutaways gags that often lampoon American culture.</p> 
<p>Although Family Guy is a very known show in America and worldwide, it has 
also received negative reviews. One of the initial critics to give the show 
negative reviews was Ken Tucker from<em>Entertainment Weekly</em>. He said that 
it lacks any reference point beyond other TV shows. Various episodes of the 
show have generated controversy. In<em>The Son Also Draws, </em>the Family Guy 
father, Peter, jokes that Canada sucks. This had a negative consequence on most 
Canadian Family Guy viewers. In<em>Extra Large Medium</em>, a character in 
Family Guy named Ellen, states that her mother is Sarah Palin, the only woman 
to have served in the office of governor in the state. Sarah Palin criticized 
the episode. Other reviewers accused the producers of the show of portraying 
religion negatively and of being racists, claiming that the Family Guy episodes 
were unsuitable.</p> 
<p>Despite these controversies, Family Guy and its cast have been nominated 
for thirteen Emmy Awards, with four wins. In 2009, Family Guy was nominated for 
an Emmy for Outstanding Comedy Series, thus becoming the first animated series 
to be nominated in this category, since the<em>Flintstones,</em> in 1961. 
Family Guy has also been nominated and has won various other awards, including 
Teen Choice Awards and People&rsquo;s Choice Awards. It is without doubt that 
Family Guy is still successful after a decade of episodes. The show is so 
successful that some of the biggest Hollywood starts have admitted to be huge 
fans, such as Robert Downey Jr, Rihanna, Britney Spears, Lauren Conrad and 
Dwayne Johnson.</p>  (No Ratings Yet) <br>

1999. Since then, Family Guy gained more fame and success and spread all over 
the world. Louise and Peter and the parents and the children are Meg, Chris and 
the baby Stewie. Family Guy is a funny animated series and I like it very much 
as it makes me laugh a lot. There is humor, but also irony and cynism, so when 
all these combine, the results are spectacular and I like the remarks of the 
characters. Briefly, Family Guy is as a pill that makes me feel great even when 
I am sad or I had a bad day. I go home and I watch Family Guy and I simply 
cannot resist without laughing.</p> 
<p>What I like very much about Family Guy is that although is an animated 
series, its characters are so authentic that I forget about that and I start 
thinking they are real actors who are playing in a movie. Another character is 
Brian, the dog, is the only one who takes baby Stewie seriously and understands 
him. In Family Guy are other characters as their neighbors and you will laugh a 
lot by this crazy family and their adventures. Family Guy is one of those thing 
that I could watch again and again.</p> 
<p>Family Guy had incredible ratings and a huge audience, so became famous all 
around the world.Family Guy is great because even at the first sight, seems a 
teenage or children series, adults also watch it very much and love it. Family 
Guy has many seasons and if you still have not watched it, it is time to do it, 
you will love it! If you already have all the episodes, you will want to see 
them all at once, but be ready to laugh a lot! This series television is one of 
those things that will stay in the memory of all of us and it will be a success 
even after many&nbsp; years. It is one of those things that you can watch 
again, but you can still laugh a lot about it!</p>  (No Ratings Yet) <br>

<h2>  Family Guy Characters </h2> 
<p> Filed under: Family Guy - 12 Oct 2011 &nbsp;|&nbsp;Spread the word ! </p> 
<br> 
<p>Family Guy is one of the most beloved animated television series, not only 
in America, but in the whole world. Seth MacFarlane, the creator of Family Guy, 
definitely knew how to make the series very successful, and he has his 
imagination to thank for that. The success of Family Guy is thus a result of 
the adventures that the Griffin family go trough and of the black humor that 
the family members are satirized with. The series is based on Peter 
Griffin&rsquo;s adventures. He is an Irish-American Catholic, a little dumb 
some may say, but with good intentions. Along the series he discovers that he 
has Spanish, Scottish, Irish and German ancestors. Peter is known especially 
for his contagious laugh and for his black sense of humor.</p> 
<p>Peter is married to Lois, another beloved Family Guy character. She is a 
housewife, but she occasionally gives piano lessons. The family where she comes 
from is called Pewterschmidt, and they are very rich people. Peter and Lois 
have three children: the adolescents Meg and Chris Griffin and the evil baby 
Stewie Griffin. Meg is constantly mocked for her ugliness, and Chris is quite 
stupid. Unlike them, the baby Stewie is keen on dominating the world and on his 
mother&rsquo;s death, and he speaks fluent and eloquent, with a fancy English 
accent. Although every other Family Guy character can hear him, he is not taken 
in serious. The only one who pays attention to his evil plan is the family dog, 
Brian. The intellectual, talking dog, Brian, is the only one who understands 
Stewie and who does not treat him like a baby.</p> 
<p>These are the main Family Guy characters, and as you can see, they form a 
pretty crazy family. This is though what makes the series so juicy and funny at 
the same time. Other recurrent Family Guy characters are the Griffin&rsquo;s 
neighbors: the paraplegic police officer Joe Swanson, his constantly pregnant 
wife Bonnie, the sexual maniac Glenn Quagmire, who longs after Lois, Cleveland 
and Loretta Brown, the local news presenters Tom Tucker and Diane Simmons, 
together with the Asian reporter Trisha Takanawa, and the crazy mayor Adam 
West. All these characters made Family Guy extremely popular and it brought the 
series record ratings and a large audience, who cannot wait to see what 
adventures are next.</p>  (No Ratings Yet) <br>

<h2>  Fun Facts About Family Guy </h2> 
<p> Filed under: Family Guy - 08 Sep 2011 &nbsp;|&nbsp;Spread the word ! </p> 
<br> 
<p>Family Guy is one of the most popular animated series in the history of 
television and it was conceived in 1995, by Seth MacFarlane, who also lent his 
voice to one of the main characters. Since then, the show has known an immense 
success and it is very beloved by both children and adults. Family Guy centers 
the life of the Griffins, a family consisting of Peter and Lois, the parents, 
Meg, Chris and Stewie, the children, and Brian, the dog. Especially for the 
show&rsquo;s fans, here are some fun facts about Family Guy.</p> 
<p>One of the funniest facts is actually the tagline of the show: 
&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t Die Laughing. We Could Get Sued&rsquo;, which fans loved, 
mostly because it catches the essence of the show and its comedy nature. Almost 
all episodes begin with the family sitting on the couch, all the characters 
have only four fingers on each hand and in every episode there is an instance 
when a character is saying to another &lsquo;What the hell&hellip;&rsquo;. 
Brian, the dog, is very cynical and he is smarter than everyone else in the 
family. He also drives a Toyota Prius, with a license plate that says 
&lsquo;Bri Dog&rsquo;.</p> 
<p>Seth MacFarlane, the creator of the show, stated that the reason why Meg is 
constantly abused by her family is because the writers were men who did not 
have a clue what to write about a teenage girl. Seth is also a fan of Star Wars 
and Star Treck, which explains the frequent references to them in the show. 
When the show was canceled, 111.000 people signed an online petition to prevent 
that from happening.</p> 
<p>As you can see, Family Guy is highly appreciated by people in the whole 
world, and it is still running. It has reached its 10th season and it has 
nearly 200 episodes. Even though it is an animated series, Family Guy is not 
only intended for children. If you did not watch any episode yet, do not 
hesitate in doing that, because it will make you laugh like you have never 
laughed before and it will cheer you up instantly.</p>  (2 votes) <br>

<h2>  Watch Family Guy </h2> 
<p> Filed under: Family Guy - 20 Jul 2010 &nbsp;|&nbsp;Spread the word ! </p> 
<br> 
<p>One of the shows that have become extremely popular amongst people who have 
enjoyed watching The Simpsons for so many years is Family Guy. This show has 
gained in popularity and the following has never been stronger than it is now. 
However, there are some instances where, no matter how much you love watching, 
you may miss an episode here and there when it plays on TV. Thankfully, there 
are solutions to catching up on the show or even just getting your Family Guy 
fix.</p> 
<p>A simple way is to find it on one of the many other channels that play 
family guy on a regular basis. There are several networks that have bought the 
right to show older episodes and Cartoon Network has even gained the power to 
show new episodes the day after their debut. This, however, may not be possible 
for everyone as there are many issues that can arise and keep people away from 
their televisions at the specified times. Nevertheless, there are two other 
legal options to watch the show if you&rsquo;re not at home.</p> 
<p>Hulu is a great way to catch up on all of your favorite television shows 
and there is an especially great selection of Family Guy episodes that are 
available for free. There is also the option to watch Family Guy on iTunes 
using your handheld Apple device. Both of these options offer you the ability 
to watch from wherever you are and whatever you may be doing without breaking 
copyright laws. If all of these ways to watch fail, or you simply don&rsquo;t 
have the equipment to use Hulu or iTunes, you can always fall back on buying 
the complete seasons on DVD and watching them whenever you have the chance to 
sit down for a while.</p>  (No Ratings Yet) <br>

<h2>  Family Guy Full Episodes </h2> 
<p> Filed under: Family Guy - 20 Apr 2010 &nbsp;|&nbsp;Spread the word ! </p> 
<br> 
<p>Missing your favorite show has to be one of the worst feelings in the 
world; especially when you are at work or involved in a prior commitment, just 
watching the clock thinking, &ldquo;Family Guy is coming on right about 
now&rdquo;. The genius of the internet and certain websites like Hulu, and 
others that offer free viewing of episodes, is that they allow viewers to catch 
their favorite new episodes of Family Guy whenever they want.</p> 
<p>Hulu has made it possible for viewers to set their own TV schedules for 
their favorite shows without breaking any laws. Unlike illegal downloading, 
where users infringe copyright laws by downloading episodes instead of paying 
for them, internet websites allow users to stream their favorite episodes with 
minimal ads in between segments.</p> 
<p>Hulu also minimizes the time spend watching commercials. While watching a 
program live, there might be 2 minutes of commercials between segments of 
Family Guy. Hulu allows viewers to watch Family Guy with only 30 second 
segments of commercials in between segments of the series. This allows 
companies to make money using advertising during the episodes, but also allows 
viewers to watch their favorite shows quicker than they would have if they had 
seen them live.</p> 
<p>In addition to Hulu, iTunes presents Family guy fans with another option 
for watching their favorite show. Hulu lets users watch the episode from start 
to finish and requires internet access to watch the segment. Additionally, Hulu 
only features certain full episodes and allows you to watch clips of other 
episodes. iTunes, however, allows users to download the full episode and watch 
it whenever they want, regardless of whether they have access to the internet 
or not. Also, iTunes features all the episodes of Family Guy that are available 
for purchase in stores, and even cuts consumers a deal when buying episodes in 
bulk, (by the season). You have the option of buying just a single episode, or 
saving some money and buying them a season at a time.</p> 
<p>Either way, missing Family Guy is a sin, and Hulu and iTunes give us a way 
to redeem ourselves.</p>  (No Ratings Yet) <br>
