<h2>Ratings: Gone Maggie Gone</h2> 
<p>Last night&rsquo;s episode &lsquo;Gone Maggie Gone&rsquo; received<strong> 
5.97 million</strong> viewers &mdash; beating out last week&rsquo;s &lsquo;No 
Loan Again, Naturally&rsquo; as second least watched episode of all time. This 
comes as Fox have consistently programmed new episodes for three weeks in a 
row, and even got around to advertising this week&rsquo;s episode during its 
commercial breaks throughout the week. One reason for the poor ratings was the 
shows lead-in, one hour of the mind-numbing Hole In The Wall, which had an 
average of 2.13 million viewers (well below cancellation territory).</p> 
<p>King Of The Hill had 5.38 million viewers, while Family Guy had 7.21 
million and American Dad had 5.82 million. Fox was fourth overall for the night 
and third among adults 18 &ndash; 49.</p>

<p>I also blame the premiere of &ldquo;Kings&rdquo;.</p> Reply <br>

<p>If your show is after Hole in the Wall, then it is inevitably doomed.</p>

<p>Surely, we can blame some others shows for taking viewers from the 
Simpsons, but I also read that this episode wasn&rsquo;t very good&hellip;<br>
 
I haven&rsquo;t seen it yet, but in a couple of days I&rsquo;ll give my 2 cents!
</p> 
<p>After all, nearly 6 millions viewers isn&rsquo;t so bad, although it can be 
much, much better!</p> Reply <br>

<p>Oh that&rsquo;s crap. I really liked this episode, didn&rsquo;t deserve 
those bad ratings,:( but the ratings doesn&rsquo;t make the episode. T thought 
it was great! Well written, many good laughts, and I totally loved the ending! 
4/5</p> 
<p>I must say that none of the HD episodes have disappointed me yet!</p> Reply

<p>I watched it last night, and really enjoyed it. One thing that really needs 
to be taken into consideration, not just with The Simpsons, is that many people 
may be using their PVRs to watch the shows later. That&rsquo;s what I do! Also, 
earlier in the season I downloaded the episodes. So, I watched them all but am 
not counted among the viewership. And does recording the show count as a viewer 
anyways?</p> Reply <br>

<p>The ratings system does not care if you download or PVR or tape the 
episodes because you&rsquo;re skipping the ads and ratings are just a way to 
measure whether a show is viable enough to generate revenue for the network and 
its advertisers.</p> Reply <br>

<p>I watched the episode last night (cause i recorded it VHS) and i liked it 
better then the last week episode, so far all of the new HD episodes have been 
really good i don&rsquo;t know why people arn&rsquo;t watching them. hope to 
see more viewers next week.</p> Reply <br>

<p>Nice episode&hellip; seriously family guy is now getting better than the 
simpsons!!!</p> 
<p>Well I just seen that ep thats coming this sun 2day, and it was a good 
episode&hellip;</p> 
<p>but yeah&hellip; the new episode is much like when marge visited a place on 
her childhood, while seeing photos from patty and selma and it burnt down, and 
the family decided to make it better, its like that&hellip; not spoiling it for 
those who does not want it to</p> Reply <br>

<p>I wonder hhow much longer these types of ratings will go on. </p> Reply <br>

<p>Aww it&rsquo;s a shame it got low ratings, especially considering Family 
guy getting good ratings with a pretty lousy episode when this was top notch. 
Oh well it&rsquo;s signed for two more seasons at least, and as long as I watch 
it and enjoy it everyone else can miss out on the fun for all I cares </p> 
<p>Of course you have to acknowledge that its gonna be very very hard to 
generate new enthusiam in the show considering the length of time it&rsquo;s 
been around. oh well I&rsquo;m looking forward to next weeks episode and to In 
the name of the Grandfather too</p> Reply <br>

opinion though.</p> Reply <br>

<p>Keep in mind, people are watching it online, and these statistics 
don&rsquo;t include that. In the last two years, I think people have turned 
much much more to internet TV.</p> Reply <br>
