<p><i><b>The Simpsons</b></i> is an American animated sitcom created by Matt 
Groening for the Fox Broadcasting Company. The series is a satirical parody of a
middle class American lifestyle epitomized by its family of the same name, 
which consists ofHomer, Marge, Bart, Lisa and Maggie. The show is set in the 
fictional town ofSpringfield and parodies American culture, society, television 
and many aspects of thehuman condition.</p> 
<p>The family was conceived by Groening shortly before a pitch for a series of 
animated shorts with the producer James L. Brooks. Groening created a 
dysfunctional family and named the characters after members of his own family, 
substituting Bart for his own name. The shorts became a part of<i>The Tracey 
Ullman Show</i> on April 19, 1987. After a three-season run, the sketch was 
developed into a half-hour prime time show and was an early hit for Fox, 
becoming the network's first series to land in the Top 30 ratings in a season 
(1989&ndash;1990).</p> 
<p>Since its debut on December 17, 1989, the show has broadcast 504 episodes 
and thetwenty-third season started airing on September 25, 2011. <i>The Simpsons
</i> is the longest-running American sitcom, the longest-running American 
animated program, and in2009 it surpassed <i>Gunsmoke</i> as the 
longest-running American primetime, scripted television series.<i>The Simpsons 
Movie</i>, a feature-length film, was released in theaters worldwide on July 26 
and July 27, 2007, and grossed over $527 million.</p> 
<p><i>The Simpsons</i> has won dozens of awards since it debuted as a series, 
including 27Primetime Emmy Awards, 30 Annie Awards and a Peabody Award. <i>Time
</i> magazine's December 31, 1999 issue named it the 20th century's best 
television series, and on January 14, 2000 the Simpson family was awarded a 
star on theHollywood Walk of Fame. Homer's exclamatory catchphrase &quot;D'oh!
&quot; has been adopted into theEnglish language, while <i>The Simpsons</i> has 
influenced many adult-oriented animated sitcoms.</p>

<h2> Production</h2> <br>
Matt Groening created the show. <br>

<h3> Development</h3>  Main articles: History of The Simpsons and The Simpsons 
shorts <br>

<p>Groening conceived of the idea for the Simpsons in the lobby of James L. 
Brooks's office. Brooks had asked Groening to pitch an idea for a series of 
animated shorts, which Groening initially intended to present as his<i>Life in 
Hell</i> series. However, when Groening realized that animating <i>Life in Hell
</i> would require the rescinding of publication rights for his life's work, he 
chose another approach and formulated his version of adysfunctional family.[1] 
He named the characters after his own family members, substituting 
&quot;Bart&quot; for his own name, adapting ananagram of the word 
&quot;brat&quot;.[2]</p> <br>
 The Simpson family as they first appeared in <i>
The Tracey Ullman Show.</i> 
<p>The Simpson family first appeared as shorts in <i>The Tracey Ullman Show</i>
 on April 19, 1987.[3] Groening submitted only basic sketches to the animators 
and assumed that the figures would be cleaned up in production. However, the 
animators merely re-traced his drawings, which led to the crude appearance of 
the characters in the initial short episodes.[2] One of the earliest jobs of the
Klasky Csupo company was creating animated sequences for <i>The Tracey Ullman 
Show</i>, on which the characters first appeared.[4] The animation was produced 
domestically at Klasky Csupo,[5] with Wes Archer, David Silverman, and Bill Kopp
 being animators for the first season.[6] Colorist Gyorgyi Peluce was the 
person who decided to make the characters yellow.[6]</p> 
<p>In 1989, a team of production companies adapted <i>The Simpsons</i> into a 
half-hour series for theFox Broadcasting Company. The team included what is now 
theKlasky Csupo animation house. Jim Brooks negotiated a provision in the 
contract with the Fox network that prevented Fox from interfering with the 
show's content.[7] Groening said his goal in creating the show was to offer the 
audience an alternative to what he called &quot;the mainstream trash&quot; that 
they were watching.[8] The half-hour series premiered on December 17, 1989 with 
&quot;Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire&quot;, a Christmas special.[9] &quot;
Some Enchanted Evening&quot; was the first full-length episode produced, but it 
did not broadcast until May 1990, as the last episode of the first season, 
because of animation problems.[10] In 1992, Tracey Ullman filed a lawsuit 
against Fox, claiming that her show was the source of the series' success. The 
suit said she should receive a share of the profits of<i>The Simpsons</i>[11]
&mdash;a claim rejected by the courts.[12]</p>

<h3> Executive producers and showrunners</h3> 
<p><b>List of showrunners throughout the series' run:</b></p> 
<ul> 
<li>Season 1&ndash;2: Matt Groening, James L. Brooks, &amp; Sam Simon</li> 
<li>Season 3&ndash;4: Al Jean &amp; Mike Reiss</li> 
<li>Season 5&ndash;6: David Mirkin</li> 
<li>Season 7&ndash;8: Bill Oakley &amp; Josh Weinstein</li> 
<li>Season 9&ndash;12: Mike Scully</li> 
<li>Season 13&ndash;present: Al Jean</li> </ul> 
<p>Matt Groening and James L. Brooks have served as executive producers during 
the show's entire history, and also function as creative consultants.Sam Simon, 
described by former<i>Simpsons</i> director Brad Bird as &quot;the unsung 
hero&quot; of the show,[13] served as creative supervisor for the first four 
seasons. He was constantly at odds with Groening, Brooks and Gracie Films and 
left in1993.[14] Before leaving, he negotiated a deal that sees him receive a 
share of the profits every year, and an executive producer credit despite not 
having worked on the show since 1993.[14][15] A more involved position on the 
show is theshowrunner, who acts as head writer and manages the show's 
production for an entire season.[6]</p> 
<h3> Writing</h3>  Main article: List of writers of The Simpsons <br>
<br>
Al 
Jean (left) is the current executive producer of the show and David Mirkin 
(right) is a former executive producer and has been a part of the writing staff 
since 1994.<br>

<p>The first team of writers, assembled by Sam Simon, consisted of John 
Swartzwelder, Jon Vitti, George Meyer, Jeff Martin, Al Jean, Mike Reiss, Jay 
Kogen and Wallace Wolodarsky.[16] Newer <i>Simpsons'</i> writing teams 
typically consist of sixteen writers who propose episode ideas at the beginning 
of each December.[17] The main writer of each episode writes the first draft. 
Group rewriting sessions develop final scripts by adding or removing jokes, 
inserting scenes, and calling for re-readings of lines by the show&rsquo;s 
vocal performers.[18] Until 2004,[19] George Meyer, who had developed the show 
since the first season, was active in these sessions. According to long-time 
writerJon Vitti, Meyer usually invented the best lines in a given episode, even 
though other writers may receive script credits.[18] Each episode takes six 
months to produce so the show rarely comments on current events.[20]</p> <br>

Front row, left to right: Dee Capelli,Lona Williams, and unknown. <br>

<p>Credited with sixty episodes, John Swartzwelder is the most prolific writer 
on<i>The Simpsons</i>' staff.[21] One of the best-known former writers is Conan 
O'Brien, who contributed to several episodes in the early 1990s before replacing
David Letterman as host of the talk show <i>Late Night</i>.[22] English comedian
Ricky Gervais wrote the episode &quot;Homer Simpson, This Is Your Wife&quot;, 
becoming the first celebrity to both write and guest star in an episode.[23] 
Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg, writers of the film <i>Superbad</i>, wrote the 
episode &quot;Homer the Whopper&quot;, with Rogen voicing a character in it.[24]
</p> 
<p><br>
 At the end of 2007 the writers of <i>The Simpsons</i> went on strike 
together with the rest of theWriters Guild of America, East. The show's writers 
had joined the guild in 1998.[25]</p>

<h3> Voice actors</h3>  Main articles: List of cast members of The Simpsons, 
List of guest stars on The Simpsons, and Non-English versions of The Simpsons 
<br> 
<p><i>The Simpsons</i> has six main cast members: Dan Castellaneta, Julie 
Kavner, Nancy Cartwright, Yeardley Smith, Hank Azaria and Harry Shearer. 
Castellaneta performsHomer Simpson, Grampa Simpson, Krusty the Clown, Barney 
Gumble and other adult, male characters.[26] Julie Kavner speaks the voices of 
Marge Simpson and Patty and Selma, as well as several minor characters.[26] 
Castellaneta and Kavner had been a part of<i>The Tracey Ullman Show</i> cast 
and were given the parts so that new actors would not be needed.[27] Cartwright 
performs the voices ofBart Simpson, Nelson Muntz, Ralph Wiggum and other 
children.[26] Smith, the voice of Lisa Simpson, is the only cast member who 
regularly voices only one character, although she occasionally plays other 
episodic characters.[26] The producers decided to hold casting for the roles of 
Bart and Lisa. Smith had initially been asked to audition for the role of Bart, 
but casting directorBonita Pietila believed her voice was too high,[28] so she 
was given the role of Lisa instead.[29] Cartwright was originally brought in to 
voice Lisa, but upon arriving at the audition, she found that Lisa was simply 
described as the &quot;middle child&quot; and at the time did not have much 
personality. Cartwright became more interested in the role of Bart, who was 
described as &quot;devious, underachieving, school-hating, irreverent, [and] 
clever&quot;.[30] Groening let her try out for the part instead, and upon 
hearing her read, gave her the job on the spot.[31] Cartwright is the only one 
of the six main<i>Simpsons</i> cast members who had been professionally trained 
in voice acting prior to working on the show.[32] Azaria and Shearer do not 
voice members of the title family, but play a majority of the male townspeople. 
Azaria, who has been a part of the<i>Simpsons</i> regular voice cast since the 
second season,[33] voices recurring characters such as Moe Szyslak, Chief Wiggum
,Apu Nahasapeemapetilon and Professor Frink. Shearer provides voices for Mr. 
Burns, Waylon Smithers, Principal Skinner, Ned Flanders, Reverend Lovejoy and 
Dr. Hibbert.[26] With the exception of Shearer, every main cast member has won a
Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Voice-Over Performance.[34] However, 
Shearer was nominated for the award in2009.[35]</p> 
<p>With one exception, episode credits list only the voice actors, and not the 
characters they voice. Both Fox and the production crew wanted to keep their 
identities secret during the early seasons and, therefore, closed most of the 
recording sessions while refusing to publish photos of the recording artists.[36
] However, the network eventually revealed which roles each actor performed in 
the episode &quot;Old Money&quot;, because the producers said the voice actors 
should receive credit for their work.[37] In 2003, the cast appeared in an 
episode of<i>Inside the Actors Studio</i>, doing live performances of their 
characters' voices.</p> 
<p>Until 1998, the six main actors were paid $30,000 per episode. In 1998 they 
were involved in a pay dispute with Fox. The company threatened to replace them 
with new actors, even going as far as preparing for casting of new voices, but 
series creator Groening supported the actors in their action.[38] The issue was 
soon resolved and, from 1998 to 2004, they were paid $125,000 per episode. The 
show's revenue continued to rise through syndication and DVD sales, and in 
April 2004 the main cast stopped appearing for script readings, demanding they 
be paid $360,000 per episode.[39][40] The strike was resolved a month later[41] 
and their salaries were increased to something between $250,000[42] and 
$360,000 per episode.[43] In 2008, production for the twentieth season was put 
on hold due to new contract negotiations with the voice actors, who wanted a 
&quot;healthy bump&quot; in salary to an amount close to $500,000 per episode.[
43] The negotiations were soon completed, and the actors' salary was raised to 
$400,000 per episode.[44]</p> Main cast members <br>

<br> 
<p>In addition to the main cast, Pamela Hayden, Tress MacNeille, Marcia Wallace
,Maggie Roswell, and Russi Taylor voice supporting characters.[26] From 1999 to 
2002, Roswell's characters were voiced byMarcia Mitzman Gaven. Karl Wiedergott 
has also appeared in minor roles, but does not voice any recurring characters.[
45] Repeat &quot;special guest&quot; cast members include Albert Brooks, Phil 
Hartman, Jon Lovitz, Joe Mantegna, and Kelsey Grammer.[46] Following Hartman's 
death in 1998, the characters he voiced were retired.[1]</p> 
<p>Episodes will quite often feature guest voices from a wide range of 
professions, including actors, athletes, authors, bands, musicians and 
scientists. In the earlier seasons, most of the guest stars voiced characters, 
but eventually more started appearing as themselves.Tony Bennett was the first 
guest star to appear as himself, appearing briefly in the season two episode 
&quot;Dancin' Homer&quot;.[47] <i>The Simpsons</i> holds the world record for 
&quot;Most Guest Stars Featured in a Television Series&quot;.[48]</p> 
<p>The show has been dubbed into several other languages, including Japanese, 
German, Spanish, and Portuguese. It is also one of the few programs dubbed in 
both French andQuebec French.[49] <i>The Simpsons</i> has been broadcast in 
Arabic, but due toIslamic customs, numerous aspects of the show have been 
changed. For example, Homer drinkssoda instead of beer and eats Egyptian beef 
sausages instead of hot dogs. Because of such changes, the Arabized version of 
the series met with a negative reaction from the life-long<i>Simpsons</i> fans 
in the area.[50]</p> 
<h3> Animation</h3> <br>
 Animation director David Silverman, who helped 
define the look of the show.[6] <br>

<p>Several different U.S. and international studios animate <i>The Simpsons</i>
. Throughout the run of the animated shorts on<i>The Tracey Ullman Show,</i> 
the animation was produced domestically atKlasky Csupo.[5] With the debut of 
the series, because of an increased workload, Fox subcontracted production to 
several international studios, located in South Korea.[5] These are AKOM,[51] 
Anivision,[52] Rough Draft Studios,[53] USAnimation,[54] and Toonzone 
Entertainment.[55] A subcontractor connection to the North Korean SEK studio 
has been suspected but not confirmed.[56] Artists at the U.S. animation studio, 
Film Roman, drawstoryboards, design new characters, backgrounds, props and draw 
character and background layouts, which in turn becomeanimatics to be screened 
for the writers at Gracie Films for any changes to be made before the work is 
shipped overseas. The overseas studios then draw theinbetweens, ink and paint, 
and render the animation to tape before it is shipped back to the United States 
to be delivered to Fox three to four months later.[57]</p> 
<p>For the first three seasons, Klasky Csupo animated <i>The Simpsons</i> in 
the United States. In 1992, the show's production company,Gracie Films, 
switched domestic production toFilm Roman,[58] who continue to animate the show 
as of 2010. InSeason 14, production switched from traditional cel animation to 
digital ink and paint.[59] The first episode to experiment with digital coloring
 was &quot;Radioactive Man&quot; in 1995. Animators used digital ink and paint 
during production of theSeason 12 episode &quot;Tennis the Menace&quot;, but 
Gracie Films delayed the regular use of digital ink and paint until two seasons 
later. The already completed &quot;Tennis the Menace&quot; was broadcast as 
made.[60]</p> 
<p>The series began high-definition production in Season 20; the first 
episode, &quot;Take My Life, Please&quot;, aired February 15, 2009. The move to 
HDTV included a new opening sequence.[61] Matt Groening called it a complicated 
change because it affected the timing and composition of animation.[62]</p> 
<h2> Characters</h2>  Main article: List of characters in The Simpsons <br>

<br> <i>The Simpsons</i> sports a vast array of secondary and tertiary 
characters. 
<p>The Simpsons are a typical family who live in a fictional &quot;Middle 
American&quot; town of Springfield.[63] Homer, the father, works as a safety 
inspector at theSpringfield Nuclear Power Plant, a position at odds with his 
careless,buffoonish personality. He is married to Marge Simpson, a stereotypical
 Americanhousewife and mother. They have three children: Bart, a ten-year-old 
troublemaker; Lisa, a precocious eight-year-old activist; andMaggie, the baby 
of the family who rarely speaks, but communicates by sucking on apacifier. The 
family owns a dog,Santa's Little Helper, and a cat, Snowball V, renamed 
Snowball II in &quot;I, (Annoyed Grunt)-Bot&quot;.[64] Both pets have had 
starring roles in several episodes. Despite the passing of yearly milestones 
such as holidays or birthdays, the Simpsons do not physically age and still 
appear just as they did at the end of the 1980s. Although the family is 
dysfunctional, many episodes examine their relationships and bonds with each 
other and they are often shown to care about one another.[65]</p> 
<p>The show includes an array of quirky characters: co-workers, teachers, 
family friends, extended relatives, townspeople and local celebrities. The 
creators originally intended many of these characters as one-time jokesters or 
for fulfilling needed functions in the town. A number of them have gained 
expanded roles and subsequently starred in their own episodes. According to 
Matt Groening, the show adopted the concept of a large supporting cast from the 
comedy show<i>SCTV</i>.[66]</p> 
<h2> Setting</h2>  Main articles: Springfield (The Simpsons) and List of 
locations in The Simpsons <br>

<p><i>The Simpsons</i> takes place in the fictional American town of 
Springfield in an unknown and impossible-to-determine U.S. state. The show is 
intentionally evasive in regard to Springfield's location.[67] Springfield's 
geography, and that of its surroundings, contains coastlines, deserts, vast 
farmland, tall mountains, or whatever the story or joke requires.[68] Groening 
has said that Springfield has much in common withPortland, Oregon, the city 
where he grew up.[69] The name &quot;Springfield&quot; is a common one in 
America and appears in 22 states.[70] Groening has said that he named it after 
Springfield, Oregon and the fictitious Springfield which was the setting of the 
series<i>Father Knows Best</i>. He &quot;figured out that Springfield was one 
of the most common names for a city in the U.S. In anticipation of the success 
of the show, I thought, 'This will be cool; everyone will think it's their 
Springfield.' And they do.&quot;[71]</p> 
<h2> Themes</h2>  Main articles: Media in The Simpsons, Politics in The 
Simpsons, and Religion in The Simpsons <br>

<p><i>The Simpsons</i> uses the standard setup of a situational comedy, or 
sitcom, as its premise. The series centers on a family and their life in a 
typical American town,[63] serving as a satirical parody of a working class 
American lifestyle.[72] However, because of its animated nature, <i>The 
Simpsons'</i> scope is larger than that of a regular sitcom. The town of 
Springfield acts as a complete universe in which characters can explore the 
issues faced by modern society. By having Homer work in a nuclear power plant, 
the show can comment on the state of the environment.[73] Through Bart and 
Lisa's days atSpringfield Elementary School, the show's writers illustrate 
pressing or controversial issues in the field of education. The town features a 
vast array of media channels&mdash;from kids' television programming to local 
news, which enables the producers to make jokes about themselves and the 
entertainment industry.[74]</p> 
<p>Some commentators say the show is political in nature and susceptible to a 
left-wing bias.[75] Al Jean admitted in an interview that &quot;We [the show] 
are of liberal bent.&quot;[76] The writers often evince an appreciation for 
liberal ideals, but the show makes jokes across the political spectrum.[77] The 
show portrays government and large corporations as callous entities that take 
advantage of the common worker.[76] Thus, the writers often portray authority 
figures in an unflattering or negative light. In<i>The Simpsons</i>, 
politicians are corrupt, ministers such asReverend Lovejoy are indifferent to 
churchgoers, and the local police force is incompetent.[78] Religion also 
figures as a recurring theme. In times of crisis, the family often turns to 
God, and the show has dealt with most of the major religions.[79]</p> 
<h2> Hallmarks</h2> 
<h3> Opening sequence</h3>  Main article: The Simpsons opening sequence <br>

<p><i>The Simpsons</i>' opening sequence is one of the show's most memorable 
hallmarks. Most episodes open with the camera zooming through the show's title 
towards the town ofSpringfield. The camera then follows the members of the 
family on their way home. Upon entering their house, the Simpsons settle down 
on their couch to watch television. The opening was created byDavid Silverman, 
the first task he did when production began on the show.[80] The series' 
distinctivetheme song was composed by musician Danny Elfman in 1989, after 
Groening approached him requesting a retro style piece. This piece has been 
noted by Elfman as the most popular of his career.[81]</p> 
<p>One of the most distinctive aspects of the opening is that three of the 
segments change from episode to episode: Bart writes different things on the 
school chalkboard,[80] Lisa plays different solos on her saxophone, and 
different gags accompany the family as they enter their living room to sit on 
the couch.[82] On February 15, 2009, a new opening credit sequence was 
introduced to accompany the switch to HDTV. The sequence had all of the 
features of the original opening, but added numerous details and characters.[83]
</p> 
<h3> Halloween episodes</h3> <br>
 Bart introducing a segment of &quot; 
Treehouse of Horror IV&quot; in the manner of Rod Serling's <i>Night Gallery</i>
.  Main article: Treehouse of Horror (series) <br>

<p>The special Halloween episode has become an annual tradition. &quot;
Treehouse of Horror&quot; first broadcast in 1990 as part of season two and 
established the pattern of three separate, self-contained stories in each 
Halloween episode.[84] These pieces usually involve the family in some horror, 
science fiction, or supernatural setting and often parody or pay homage to a 
famous piece of work in those genres.[85] They always take place outside the 
normal continuity of the show. Although the<i>Treehouse</i> series is meant to 
be seen on Halloween, in recent years, new installments have premiered after 
Halloween due toFox's current contract with Major League Baseball's World Series
.[86]</p> 
<h3> Humor</h3> 
<p>The show's humor turns on cultural references that cover a wide spectrum of 
society so that viewers from all generations can enjoy the show.[87] Such 
references, for example, come from movies, television, music, literature, 
science, and history.[87] The animators also regularly add jokes or sight gags 
into the show's background via humorous or incongruous bits of text in signs, 
newspapers, and elsewhere.[88] The audience may often not notice the visual 
jokes in a single viewing. Some are so fleeting that they become apparent only 
by pausing a video recording of the show.[88] Kristin Thompson argues that <i>
The Simpsons</i> uses a &quot;...flurry of cultural references, intentionally 
inconsistent characterization, and considerable self-reflexivity about 
television conventions and the status of the programme as a television 
show.&quot;[89]</p> 
<p>One of Bart's early hallmarks were his prank calls to Moe's Tavern owner 
Moe Szyslak in which Bart calls Moe and asks for a gag name. Moe tries to find 
that person in the bar, but soon realizes it is a prank call and angrily 
threatens Bart. These calls were based on a series of prank calls known as the
Tube Bar recordings. Moe was based partly on Tube Bar owner Louis 
&quot;Red&quot; Deutsch, whose often profane responses inspired Moe's violent 
side.[90] As the series progressed, it became more difficult for the writers to 
come up with a fake name and to write Moe's angry response, and the pranks were 
dropped as a regular joke during the fourth season.[91][92] <i>The Simpsons</i> 
also often includesself-referential humor.[93] The most common form is jokes 
about Fox Broadcasting.[94] For example, the episode &quot;She Used to Be My 
Girl&quot; included a scene where a Fox News van drove down the street while 
displaying a large &quot;Bush Cheney 2004&quot; banner and playingQueen's &quot;
We Are the Champions&quot;, in reference to the 2004 presidential election.[95][
96]</p> 
<p>The show uses catchphrases, and most of the primary and secondary 
characters have at least one each.[97] Notable expressions include Homer's 
annoyed grunt &quot;D'oh!&quot;, Mr. Burns' &quot;Excellent...&quot; and Nelson 
Muntz's &quot;<i>Ha</i>-ha!&quot;. Some of Bart's catchphrases, such as &quot;
<i>&iexcl;Ay, caramba!</i>&quot;, &quot;Don't have a cow, man!&quot; and 
&quot;Eat my shorts!&quot; appeared on t-shirts in the show's early days.[98] 
However, Bart rarely used the latter two phrases until after they became 
popular through themerchandising. The use of many of these catchphrases has 
declined in recent seasons. The episode &quot;Bart Gets Famous&quot; mocks 
catchphrase-based humor, as Bart achieves fame on the<i>Krusty the Clown Show
</i> solely for saying &quot;I didn't do it.&quot;[99]</p> 
<h2> Influences on culture</h2> 
<h3> Idioms</h3> 
<p>A number of neologisms that originated on <i>The Simpsons</i> have entered 
popular vernacular.[100][101] Mark Liberman, director of the Linguistic Data 
Consortium, remarked, &quot;<i>The Simpsons</i> has apparently taken over from 
Shakespeare and the Bible as our culture's greatest source of idioms, 
catchphrases and sundry other textual allusions.&quot;[101] The most famous 
catchphrase is Homer's annoyed grunt: &quot;D'oh!&quot; So ubiquitous is the 
expression that it is now listed in the<i>Oxford English Dictionary</i>, but 
without the apostrophe.[102] Dan Castellaneta says he borrowed the phrase from 
James Finlayson, an actor in early Laurel and Hardy comedies, who pronounced it 
in a more elongated and whining tone. The staff of<i>The Simpsons</i> told 
Castellaneta to shorten the noise, and it went on to become the well-known 
exclamation in the television series.[103]</p> 
<p>Groundskeeper Willie's description of the French as &quot;cheese-eating 
surrender monkeys&quot; was used by <i>National Review</i> columnist Jonah 
Goldberg in 2003, after France's opposition to the proposed invasion of Iraq. 
The phrase quickly spread to other journalists.[101][104] &quot;Cromulent&quot; 
and &quot;Embiggen&quot;, words used in &quot;Lisa the Iconoclast&quot;, have 
since appeared in theDictionary.com's 21st Century Lexicon,[105] and scientific 
journals respectively.[101][106] &quot;Kwyjibo&quot;, a fake Scrabble word 
invented by Bart in &quot;Bart the Genius&quot;, was used as one of the aliases 
of the creator of theMelissa worm.[107] &quot;I, for one, welcome our new 
insect overlords&quot;, was used byKent Brockman in &quot;Deep Space Homer
&quot; and has become a common variety of phrase.[108] Variants of Brockman's 
utterance are used to express mock submission, usually for the purpose of humor.
[109] It has been used in media, such as <i>New Scientist</i> magazine.[110] 
The dismissive term &quot;Meh&quot;, believed to have been popularized by the 
show,[101][111][112] entered the Collins English Dictionary in 2008.[113] Other 
words credited as stemming from the show include &quot;yoink&quot; and 
&quot;craptacular&quot;.[101]</p> 
<p><i>The Oxford Dictionary of Modern Quotations</i> includes several 
quotations from the show. As well as &quot;cheese-eating surrender 
monkeys&quot;, Homer's lines, &quot;Kids, you tried your best and you failed 
miserably. The lesson is never try&quot;, from &quot;Burns' Heir&quot; (season 
five, 1994) as well as &quot;Kids are the best, Apu. You can teach them to hate 
the things you hate. And they practically raise themselves, what with the 
Internet and all&quot;, from &quot;Eight Misbehavin'&quot; (season 11, 1999), 
entered the dictionary in August 2007.[114]</p> 
<h3> Television</h3> 
<p><i>The Simpsons</i> was the first successful animated program in American 
prime time since<i>Wait Till Your Father Gets Home</i> in the 1970s.[115] 
During most of the 1980s, US pundits considered animated shows as appropriate 
only for children, and animating a show was too expensive to achieve a quality 
suitable for prime-time television.<i>The Simpsons</i> changed this perception.[
5] The use of Korean animation studios for tweening, coloring, and filming made 
the episodes cheaper. The success of<i>The Simpsons</i> and the lower 
production cost prompted US television networks to take chances on other 
animated series.[5] This development led US producers to a 1990s boom in new, 
animated prime-time shows, such as<i>South Park</i>, <i>Family Guy</i>, <i>King 
of the Hill</i>, <i>Futurama</i>, and <i>The Critic</i>.[5] &quot;<i>The 
Simpsons</i> created an audience for prime-time animation that had not been 
there for many, many years&quot;, said<i>Family Guy</i> creator Seth MacFarlane
. &quot;As far as I'm concerned, they basically re-invented the wheel. They 
created what is in many ways&mdash;you could classify it as&mdash;a wholly new 
medium.&quot;[116] <i>South Park</i> later paid homage to <i>The Simpsons</i> 
with the episode &quot;Simpsons Already Did It&quot;.[117] In Georgia, the 
animated television sitcom<i>The Samsonadzes</i>, launched in November 2009, 
has been noted for its very strong resemblance with<i>The Simpsons</i>, which 
its creator Shalva Ramishvili has acknowledged.[118][119][120]</p> 
<p><i>The Simpsons</i> has also influenced live-action shows like <i>Malcolm 
in the Middle</i>, which featured the use of sight gags and did not use a laugh 
track unlike most sitcoms.[121][122] <i>Malcolm in the Middle</i> debuted 
January 9, 2000 in the time slot after<i>The Simpsons</i>. Ricky Gervais has 
called<i>The Simpsons</i> a major influence on his British comedy <i>The Office
</i>, which also dispenses with a laugh track.[123] Fellow British sitcom <i>
Spaced</i> was, according to its director Edgar Wright, &quot;an attempt to do 
a live-action<i>The Simpsons</i>.&quot;[124]</p> 
<h2> Reception, legacy and achievements</h2> 
<h3> Early success</h3> 
<p><i>The Simpsons</i> was the Fox network's first television series to rank 
among a season's top 30 highest-rated shows.[125] While later seasons would 
focus on Homer, Bart was the lead character in most of the first three seasons. 
In 1990, Bart quickly became one of the most popular characters on television 
in what was termed &quot;Bartmania&quot;.[126][127][128][129] He became the 
most prevalent<i>Simpsons</i> character on memorabilia, such as T-shirts. In 
the early 1990s, millions of T-shirts featuring Bart were sold;[130] as many as 
one million were sold on some days.[131] Believing Bart to be a bad role model, 
several American public schools banned T-shirts featuring Bart next to captions 
such as &quot;I'm Bart Simpson. Who the hell are you?&quot; and 
&quot;Underachiever ('And proud of it, man!')&quot;.[132][133][134] <i>The 
Simpsons</i> merchandise sold well and generated $2 billion in revenue during 
the first 14 months of sales.[132] Because of his popularity, Bart was often 
the most promoted member of the Simpson family in advertisements for the show, 
even for episodes in which he was not involved in the main plot.[135]</p> 
<p>Due to the show's success, over the summer of 1990 the Fox Network decided 
to switch<i>The Simpsons</i>' time slot so that it would move from 8:00 p.m. ET 
on Sunday night to the same time on Thursday, where it would compete with<i>The 
Cosby Show</i> on NBC, the number one show at the time.[136][137] Through the 
summer, several news outlets published stories about the supposed &quot;Bill 
vs. Bart&quot; rivalry.[131][136] &quot;Bart Gets an F&quot; (season two, 1990) 
was the first episode to air against<i>The Cosby Show</i>, and it received a 
lowerNielsen ratings, tying for eighth behind <i>The Cosby Show</i>, which had 
an 18.5 rating. The rating is based on the number of household televisions that 
were tuned into the show, butNielsen Media Research estimated that 33.6 million 
viewers watched the episode, making it the number one show in terms of actual 
viewers that week. At the time, it was the most watched episode in the history 
of the Fox Network,[138] and it is still the highest rated episode in the 
history of<i>The Simpsons</i>.[139]</p> 
<p><i>The Simpsons</i> has been praised by many critics, being described as 
&quot;the most irreverent and unapologetic show on the air.&quot;[140] In a 
1990 review of the show, Ken Tucker of<i>Entertainment Weekly</i> described it 
as &quot;the American family at its most complicated, drawn as simple cartoons. 
It's this neat paradox that makes millions of people turn away from the three 
big networks on Sunday nights to concentrate on The Simpsons.&quot;[141] Tucker 
would also describe the show as a &quot;pop-cultural phenomenon, a prime-time 
cartoon show that appeals to the entire family.&quot;[142]</p> 
<h3> Run length achievements</h3> 
<p>On February 9, 1997, <i>The Simpsons</i> surpassed <i>The Flintstones</i> 
with the episode &quot;The Itchy &amp; Scratchy &amp; Poochie Show&quot; as the 
longest-running prime-time animated series in the United States.[143] In 2004, 
<i>The Simpsons</i> replaced <i>The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet</i> (1952 
to 1966) as the longest-running sitcom (animated orlive action) in the United 
States.[144] In 2009, <i>The Simpsons</i> surpassed <i>The Adventures of Ozzie 
and Harriet</i>'s record of 435 episodes and is now recognized by Guinness 
World Records as the world's longest running sitcom (in terms of episode count).
[145][146] In October 2004, <i>Scooby-Doo</i> briefly overtook <i>The Simpsons
</i> as the American animated show with the highest number of episodes.[147] 
However, network executives in April 2005 again cancelled<i>Scooby-Doo</i>, 
which finished with 371 episodes, and<i>The Simpsons</i> reclaimed the title 
with 378 episodes at the end of their seventeenth season.[148] In May 2007, <i>
The Simpsons</i> reached their 400th episode at the end of the eighteenth 
season. While<i>The Simpsons</i> has the record for the number of episodes by 
an American animated show, other animated series have surpassed<i>The Simpsons
</i>.[149] For example, the Japanese anime series <i>Sazae-san</i> has over 
3,000 episodes to its credit.[149]</p> 
<p>In 2009, Fox began a year-long celebration of the show titled &quot;Best. 
20 Years. Ever.&quot; to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the premiere of<i>
The Simpsons</i>. One of the first parts of the celebration is the 
&quot;Unleash Your Yellow&quot; contest in which entrants must design a poster 
for the show.[150] The celebration ended on January 10, 2010 (almost twenty 
years after &quot;Bart the Genius&quot; aired on January 14, 1990) with <i>The 
Simpsons 20th Anniversary Special - In 3-D! On Ice!</i>, a documentary special 
by documentary filmmakerMorgan Spurlock that examines the &quot;cultural 
phenomenon of<i>The Simpsons</i>&quot;.[151][152]</p> 
<p>As of the twenty-first season (2009&ndash;2010), <i>The Simpsons</i> became 
the longest-running American primetime, scripted television series, having 
surpassed<i>Gunsmoke</i>. However, <i>Gunsmoke'</i>s episode count of 635 
episodes far surpasses<i>The Simpsons</i>, which would not reach that mark 
until its approximate 29th season, under normal programming schedules.[144][153]
 In October 2011, Fox announced that<i>The Simpsons</i> had been renewed for a 
24th and 25th season, which means the show will reach 559 episodes.[154][155]

<h3> Awards</h3>  Main article: List of awards and nominations received by The 
Simpsons <br>
<br>
 The Simpsons have been awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk 
of Fame. <br>

<p><i>The Simpsons</i> has won dozens of awards since it debuted as a series, 
including 27Primetime Emmy Awards,[48] 30 Annie Awards[156] and a Peabody Award.
[157] In a 1999 issue celebrating the 20th century's greatest achievements in 
arts and entertainment,<i>Time</i> magazine named <i>The Simpsons</i> the 
century's best television series.[158] In that same issue, <i>Time</i> included 
Bart Simpson in the<i>Time 100</i>, the publication's list of the century's 100 
most influential people.[159] Bart was the only fictional character on the 
list. On January 14, 2000, the Simpsons were awarded a star on theHollywood 
Walk of Fame.[160] Also in 2000, <i>Entertainment Weekly</i> magazine TV critic 
Ken Tucker named<i>The Simpsons</i> the greatest television show of the 1990s. 
Furthermore, viewers of the UK television channelChannel 4 have voted <i>The 
Simpsons</i> at the top of two polls: 2001's 100 Greatest Kids' TV shows,[161] 
and 2005's The 100 Greatest Cartoons,[162] with Homer Simpson voted into first 
place in 2001's 100 Greatest TV Characters.[163] Homer would also place ninth on
<i>Entertainment Weekly</i>'s list of the &quot;50 Greatest TV icons&quot;.[164]
 In 2002,<i>The Simpsons</i> ranked #8 on <i>TV Guide</i>'s 50 Greatest TV 
Shows of All Time,[165] and in 2007 it was included in <i>TIME</i>'s list of 
the &quot;100 Best TV Shows of All Time&quot;.[166] In 2008 the show was placed 
in first on<i>Entertainment Weekly</i>'s &quot;Top 100 Shows of the Past 25 
Years&quot;.[167] <i>Empire</i> named it the greatest TV show of all time.[168] 
In 2010,<i>Entertainment Weekly</i> named Homer &quot;the greatest character of 
the last 20 years.&quot;[169]</p> 
<h3> Criticism and controversy</h3> 
<p>Bart's rebellious nature, which frequently resulted in no punishment for 
his misbehavior, led some parents andconservatives to characterize him as a poor
role model for children.[170][171] In schools, educators claimed that Bart was 
a &quot;threat to learning&quot; because of his &quot;underachiever and proud 
of it&quot; attitude and negative attitude regarding his education.[172] Others 
described him as &quot;egotistical, aggressive and mean-spirited&quot;.[173] In 
a 1991 interview,Bill Cosby described Bart as a bad role model for children, 
calling him &quot;angry, confused, frustrated&quot;. In response, Matt Groening 
said, &quot;That sums up Bart, all right. Most people are in a struggle to be 
normal [and] he thinks normal is very boring, and does things that others just 
wished they dare do.&quot;[174] On January 27, 1992, then-President George H. 
W. Bush said, &quot;We are going to keep on trying to strengthen the American 
family, to make American families a lot more likethe Waltons and a lot less 
like the Simpsons.&quot;[132] The writers rushed out a tongue-in-cheek reply in 
the form of a short segment which aired three days later before a rerun of 
&quot;Stark Raving Dad&quot; in which Bart replied, &quot;Hey, we're just like 
the Waltons. We're praying for an end to the Depression, too.&quot;[175][176]
</p> 
<p>Various episodes of the show have generated controversy. The Simpsons visit 
Australia in &quot;Bart vs. Australia&quot; (season six, 1995) and Brazil in 
&quot;Blame It on Lisa&quot; (season 13, 2002) and both episodes generated 
controversy and negative reaction in the visited countries.[177] In the latter 
case, Rio de Janeiro's tourist board&nbsp;&ndash; who claimed that the city was 
portrayed as having rampant street crime, kidnappings, slums, and monkey and 
rat infestations&nbsp;&ndash; went so far as to threaten Fox with legal action.[
178] Groening was a fierce and vocal critic of the episode &quot;A Star Is Burns
&quot; (season six, 1995) which featured a crossover with <i>The Critic</i>. He 
felt that it was just an advertisement for<i>The Critic</i>, and that people 
would incorrectly associate the show with him. When he was unsuccessful in 
getting the episode pulled, he had his name removed from the credits and went 
public with his concerns, openly criticizing James L. Brooks and saying the 
episode &quot;violates the Simpsons' universe.&quot; In response, Brooks said 
&quot;I am furious with Matt, [...] he's allowed his opinion, but airing this 
publicly in the press is going too far. [...] his behavior right now is 
rotten.&quot;[179][180] &quot;The Principal and the Pauper&quot; (season nine, 
1997) is one of the most controversial episodes of<i>The Simpsons</i>. Many 
fans and critics reacted negatively to the revelation thatSeymour Skinner, a 
recurring character since the first season, was an impostor. The episode has 
been criticized by Groening and byHarry Shearer, who provides the voice of 
Skinner. In a 2001 interview, Shearer recalled that after reading the script, 
he told the writers, &quot;That's so wrong. You're taking something that an 
audience has built eight years or nine years of investment in and just tossed 
it in the trash can for no good reason, for a story we've done before with 
other characters. It's so arbitrary and gratuitous, and it's disrespectful to 
the audience.&quot;[181]</p> 
<p>The show has reportedly been taken off the air in several countries. China 
banned it from prime-time television in August 2006, &quot;in an effort to 
protect China's struggling animation studios.&quot;[182] In 2008, Venezuela 
barred the show from airing on morning television as it was &quot;unsuitable 
for children&quot;.[183] The same year, several Russian Pentecostal churches 
demanded<i>The Simpsons</i>, <i>South Park</i> and some other Western cartoons 
to be put off air &quot;for propaganda of various vices&quot; and the 
broadcaster's license to be revoked. However, the court decision later 
dismissed this request.[184]</p> 
<h4> Criticism of declining quality</h4> 
<p>Critics' reviews of early <i>Simpsons</i> episodes praised the show for its 
wit, realism, and intelligence.[8][185] In the late 1990s, around the airing of 
season ten, the tone and emphasis of the show began to change. Some critics 
started calling the show &quot;tired&quot;.[186] By 2000, some long-term fans 
had become disillusioned with the show and pointed to its shift from 
character-driven plots to what they perceived as an overemphasis on zany antics.
[187][188][189] The BBC noted &quot;the common consensus is that <i>The Simpsons
</i>' golden era ended after season nine&quot;,[190] while Todd Leopold of CNN, 
in an article looking at its perceived decline, stated &quot;for many fans 
[...] the glory days are long past.&quot;[189] Jim Schembri of the <i>Sydney 
Morning Herald</i> called the show &quot;a cultural touchstone for at least 
two&mdash;possibly three&mdash;generations of couch potatoes&quot;, but claimed 
that the show has declined in quality. He attributed this to an abandonment of 
character-driven storylines in favour of and overuse of celebritycameo 
appearances and references to popular culture. Schembri wrote: &quot;The 
central tragedy of<i>The Simpsons</i> is that it has gone from commanding 
attention to merely being attention seeking. It began by proving that cartoon 
characters don't have to be caricatures; they can be invested with real 
emotions. Now the show has in essence fermented into a limp parody of itself. 
Memorable story arcs have been sacrificed for the sake of celebrity walk-ons 
and punchline-hungry dialogue.&quot;[191]</p> 
<p>Author Douglas Coupland described claims of declining quality in the series 
as &quot;hogwash&quot;, saying &quot;<i>The Simpsons</i> hasn't fumbled the 
ball in fourteen years, it's hardly likely to fumble it now.&quot;[192] Mike 
Scully, who was showrunner during seasons nine through twelve, has been the 
subject of criticism.[193][194] Chris Suellentrop of <i>Slate</i> wrote that 
&quot;under Scully's tenure,<i>The Simpsons</i> became, well, a cartoon. [...] 
Episodes that once would have ended withHomer and Marge bicycling into the 
sunset now end with Homer blowing a tranquilizer dart into Marge's neck. The 
show's still funny, but it hasn't been touching in years.&quot;[193] When asked 
in 2007 how the series' longevity is sustained, Scully joked, &quot;Lower your 
quality standards. Once you've done that you can go on forever.&quot;[195]</p> 
<p>In 2003, to celebrate the show's 300th episode &quot;Barting Over&quot;, <i>
USA Today</i> published a pair of Simpsons related articles: a top-ten episodes 
list chosen by the webmaster ofThe Simpsons Archive fansite,[196] and a top-15 
list by<i>The Simpsons'</i> own writers.[197] The most recent episode listed on 
the fan list was 1997's &quot;Homer's Phobia&quot;; the Simpsons' writers most 
recent choice was 2000's &quot;Behind the Laughter&quot;. In 2004, Harry Shearer
 criticized what he perceived as the show's declining quality: &quot;I rate the 
last three seasons as among the worst, so Season Four looks very good to me 
now.&quot;[198] In response, Dan Castellaneta stated &quot;I don't agree, [...] 
I think Harry's issue is that the show isn't as grounded as it was in the first 
three or four seasons, that it's gotten crazy or a little more madcap. I think 
it organically changes to stay fresh.&quot;[199]</p> 
<p>Despite the criticism, <i>The Simpsons</i> manages to maintain a large 
viewership and attract new fans. While the first season enjoyed an average of 
13.4 million viewers per episode in the U.S.,[125] the twenty-first season had 
an average of 7.2 million viewers.[200] In an April 2006 interview, Matt 
Groening said, &quot;I honestly don't see any end in sight. I think it's 
possible that the show will become too financially cumbersome... but right now, 
the show is creatively, I think, as good or better than it's ever been. The 
animation is incredibly detailed and imaginative, and the stories do things 
that we haven't done before. So creatively there's no reason to quit.&quot;[201]

<h3> Comic books</h3> 
<p>Numerous Simpson-related comic books have been released over the years. So 
far, ninecomic book series have been published by Bongo Comics since 1993.[202] 
The firstcomic strips based on <i>The Simpsons</i> appeared in 1991 in the 
magazine<i>Simpsons Illustrated</i>, which was a companion magazine to the show.
[203] The comic strips were popular and a one-shot comic book titled <i>
Simpsons Comics and Stories</i>, containing four different stories, was 
released in 1993 for the fans.[204] The book was a success and due to this, the 
creator of<i>The Simpsons</i>, Matt Groening, and his companions Bill Morrison, 
Mike Rote, Steve Vance and Cindy Vance created the publishing company Bongo 
Comics.[204] Issues of <i>Simpsons Comics</i>, <i>Bart Simpson's Treehouse of 
Horror</i> and <i>Bart Simpson</i> have been collected and reprinted in trade 
paperbacks in the United States by HarperCollins.[205][206][207]</p> 
<h3> Film</h3>  Main article: The Simpsons Movie <br>
<br>
 A Seattle 7-Eleven 
store transformed into aKwik-E-Mart as part of a promotion for <i>The Simpsons 
Movie</i>. 
<p>20th Century Fox, Gracie Films, and Film Roman produced <i>The Simpsons 
Movie</i>, an animated film that was released on July 27, 2007.[208] The film 
was directed by long-time<i>Simpsons</i> producer David Silverman and written 
by a team of<i>Simpsons</i> writers comprising Matt Groening, James L. Brooks, 
Al Jean, George Meyer,Mike Reiss, John Swartzwelder, Jon Vitti, David Mirkin, 
Mike Scully, Matt Selman, and Ian Maxtone-Graham.[208] Production of the film 
occurred alongside continued writing of the series despite long-time claims by 
those involved in the show that a film would enter production only after the 
series had concluded.[208] There had been talk of a possible feature-length <i>
Simpsons</i> film ever since the early seasons of the series. James L. Brooks 
originally thought that the story of the episode &quot;Kamp Krusty&quot; was 
suitable for a film, but he encountered difficulties in trying to expand the 
script to feature-length.[209] For a long time, difficulties such as lack of a 
suitable story and an already fully engaged crew of writers delayed the project.

<h3> Music</h3>  Main article: The Simpsons discography <br>

<p>Collections of original music featured in the series have been released on 
the albums<i>Songs in the Key of Springfield</i>, <i>Go Simpsonic with The 
Simpsons</i> and <i>The Simpsons: Testify</i>.[210] Several songs have been 
recorded with the purpose of a single or album release and have not been 
featured on the show. The album<i>The Simpsons Sing the Blues</i> was released 
in September 1990 and was a success, peaking at #3 on the<i>Billboard</i> 200[
211] and becoming certified 2&times; platinum by the Recording Industry 
Association of America.[212] The first single from the album was the pop rap 
song &quot;Do the Bartman&quot;, performed by Nancy Cartwright and released on 
November 20, 1990. The song was written byMichael Jackson, although he did not 
receive any credit.[213] <i>The Yellow Album</i> was released in 1998, but 
received poor reception and did not chart in any country.</p> 
<h3> The Simpsons Ride</h3>  Main article: The Simpsons Ride <br>
<br>
The 
Simpsons Ride at Universal Studios Florida. <br>

<p>In 2007, it was officially announced that The Simpsons Ride, a simulator 
ride, would be implemented into the Universal Studios Orlando and Universal 
Studios Hollywood.[214] It officially opened May 15, 2008 in Florida[215] and 
May 19, 2008 in Hollywood.[216] In the ride, patrons are introduced to a 
cartoon theme park called Krustyland built byKrusty the Clown. However, 
Sideshow Bob is loose from prison to get revenge on Krusty and the Simpson 
family.[217] It features more than 24 regular characters from <i>The Simpsons
</i> and features the voices of the regular cast members, as well as Pamela 
Hayden, Russi Taylor and Kelsey Grammer.[218] Harry Shearer decided not to 
participate in the ride, so none of his characters have vocal parts.[219]</p> 
<h3> Video games</h3>  Further information: List of The Simpsons video games 
<br> 
<p>Numerous video games back on the show have been produced. Some of the early 
games includeKonami's arcade game <i>The Simpsons</i> (1991) and Acclaim 
Entertainment's <i>The Simpsons: Bart vs. the Space Mutants</i> (1991).[220][221
] More modern games include <i>The Simpsons Road Rage</i> (2001), <i>The 
Simpsons Hit &amp; Run</i> (2003) and <i>The Simpsons Game</i> (2007).[222][223]
[224] Electronic Arts, who produced <i>The Simpsons Game</i>, have owned the 
exclusive rights to create video games based on the show since 2005.[225] In 
2010 they released a game called<i>The Simpsons Arcade</i> for the iPhone.[226] 
Two<i>Simpsons</i> pinball machines have been produced; one that was available 
briefly after the first season, and another that is still available for 
purchase.[227]</p> 
<h2> Merchandise</h2>  See also: List of The Simpsons books&nbsp;and List of 
The Simpsons DVDs <br>

<p>The popularity of <i>The Simpsons</i> has made it a billion-dollar 
merchandising industry.[132] The title family and supporting characters appear 
on everything from t-shirts to posters.<i>The Simpsons</i> has inspired special 
editions of well-known board games, includingClue, Scrabble, Monopoly, Operation
, andThe Game of Life, as well as the trivia games What Would Homer Do? and 
Simpsons Jeopardy!. Several card games such as trump cards and The Simpsons 
Trading Card Game have also been released. Many official or unofficial <i>
Simpsons</i> books such as episode guides have been published. Many episodes of 
the show have been released on DVD and VHS over the years. When the first 
season DVD was released in 2001, it quickly became the best-selling television 
DVD in history, although it was later overtaken by the first season of<i>
Chappelle's Show</i>.[228] In particular, seasons one through fourteen have 
been released on DVD in the U.S. (Region 1), Europe (Region 2) and 
Australia/New Zealand/Latin America (Region 4) with more seasons expected to be 
released in the future.[229]</p> 
<p>In 2003, about 500 companies around the world were licensed to use <i>
Simpsons</i> characters in their advertising.[230] As a promotion for <i>The 
Simpsons Movie</i>, twelve 7-Eleven stores were transformed into Kwik-E-Marts 
and sold<i>The Simpsons</i> related products. These included &quot;Buzz 
Cola&quot;, &quot;Krusty-O&quot; cereal, pink doughnuts with sprinkles, and 
&quot;Squishees&quot;.[231]</p> 
<p>In 2008 consumers around the world spent $750 million on merchandise 
related to<i>The Simpsons</i>, with half of the amount originating from the 
United States. By 2009 20th Century Fox increased merchandising efforts.[232] 
On April 9, 2009, theUnited States Postal Service unveiled a series of five 44 
cent stamps featuring Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa and Maggie, to commemorate the 
show's twentieth anniversary.[233] <i>The Simpsons</i> is the first television 
series still in production to receive this recognition.[234][235] The stamps, 
designed by Matt Groening, were made available for purchase on May 7, 2009.[236]
 Approximately one billion were printed.[237]</p>
