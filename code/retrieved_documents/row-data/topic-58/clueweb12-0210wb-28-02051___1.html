<h2>Homer Simpson, American Hero</h2> 
<p> It is but a small step from the sublime to the ridiculous &ndash; from 
Elvis&rsquo;s 75th Birthday last week to the Simpsons&rsquo; 20th Birthday 
today.</p> 
<p> Purists will point out that America&rsquo;s First Cartoon Family actually 
originated on the Tracey Ullman Show two years before their own full season 
premiere in 1990, and, even then, the first episode was in fact shown in the 
run up to Christmas the previous year, but today is the official anniversary 
and who are we to argue with Fox?</p> 
<p> Although mini-anarchist Bart was originally the focus of a couple of years 
of &ldquo;Bartmania&rdquo;, it is his father, Homer, who has proved the real 
&ldquo;break out&rdquo; character.</p> 
<p> Homer Simpson is an &ldquo;everyman&rdquo; character with whom most 
middle-aged men, and their families, can identify. The dark side of the 
American dream, he is a lazy, overweight, self-centred &ndash; but not entirely 
selfish &ndash; salary drone who is unencumbered by much in the way of 
intelligence or drive.</p> 
<p> Yet even he is not immune to the distinctively American belief that if you 
take your chances and work hard, you can achieve a better life. In fact, he has 
rather an impressive track record as an entrepreneur. He has founded at least 
three businesses of his own: Spring Shield, a security firm; Mr Plow, a snow 
clearance operation; and Compu-Global-Hyper-Mega-Net, an internet business.</p> 
<p> No one, including Homer, ever knew what Compu-Global-Hyper-Mega-Net 
actually did, but then the same is true of a great many internet businesses, 
especially those established in the 90s, and their founders.</p> 
<p> Homer has also enjoyed short-term success as a bootleg &ldquo;Beer 
Baron&rdquo;, as a film producer, as a travelling aphrodisiac salesman, as an 
experimental farmer, as an unlicensed chiropractor, and twice as a talent agent.
</p> 
<p> None of these enterprises lasted long, or left him with any significant 
profits in the end, but there is something heroic in the way he keeps trying 
despite his constant failures.</p> 
<p> After all, he can take comfort &ndash; as can we all &ndash; from the fact 
that bigger idiots than Homer Simpson have succeeded in business simply by 
being in the right place at the right time with a very simple idea and the 
courage to act on it.&nbsp; </p>  90369ba0-a7bf-4bb8-90ef-d5bebf9fcf7f|1|5.0
