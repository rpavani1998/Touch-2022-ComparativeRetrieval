<h2>Beginner/Intermediate Skiers: Skiing Buttermilk</h2> 
<p>If you&rsquo;ve just arrived in Aspen, and you&rsquo;ve never been on skis 
before, Buttermilk is far and away your best choice to learn how to ski. Though 
it&rsquo;s home to ESPN&rsquo;s Winter X Games and has one of the most fearsome 
terrain parks to be found anywhere, Buttermilk is still, at its heart, an 
exceptional beginner&rsquo;s mountain.</p>

<h2>Beginner/Intermediate Skiers: Skiing Snowmass</h2> 
<p>Despite its massive size, Snowmass has relatively little in the way of 
beginner terrain, with just 6 percent of the runs bearing a green circle. It 
more than makes up for this shortcoming, however, with thousands of acres of 
some of the best intermediate trails to be found anywhere, including many runs 
that are suitable for skiers with a just a few days&rsquo; experience under 
their belts.</p>

<h2>Buttermilk in Aspen: A Great Place to Learn How to Board or Ski</h2> 
<p>Learning to ski or snowboard is easy. </p> 
<p>First, be under 21.Then slip, slide, tumble and bruise your way down the 
most difficult trail on the highest mountain you can find. Repeat eight hours a 
day, seven days a week until mommy and daddy&rsquo;s money runs out or 
Christmas break is over.</p>

<h2>Challenge Aspen hosts IPC Alpine World Cup - Next Stop, the Paralympic 
Games in Whistler</h2> 
<p><strong>Joe Tompkins shares the glory</strong>This weekend, the flame was 
lit and the games began, again. March 12th rekindled Vancouver, as almost 300 
torchbearers ushered in the glow of the 2010 Paralympics Games, March 13-21. 
And just over a week ago, Challenge Aspen hosted nearly 120 competitors from 20 
countries on the slopes of Buttermilk, for the last stop on the IPC Alpine 
World Cup Circuit.</p> 
<p> * * *</p> 
<p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;s the course?&rdquo; asks Mudflap, lift operator 
extraordinaire and congenial mountain host, cooking up brats and award-winning 
chili at the base of Tiehack during the week&rsquo;s unseasonably warm race 
days.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;Are you kidding? Living the dream,&rdquo; says Challenge Aspen 
Competition Team Coach John McBride. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a little soft today for 
ski racing, but for watching a ski race in the blazing sun? Perfect!&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Paddling around the Whitewater</strong><b>ASPEN, CO</b> - Charlie

Snowmass for 27 years, and raced his surf ski through 36 miles of open ocean in 
the prestigious Hawaiian Moloka&rsquo;i Channel Race. These days, he&rsquo;s 
combining key elements of Nordic skiing, surfing and kayaking across Aspen 
whitewater, bringing the latest craze of stand-up paddling to local rivers, 
inviting locals and visitors to jump aboard.</p>

<h2>Climbing, Falling and Fall up Independence Pass: Rock and Ramblings, Part 3
</h2> 
<p>Some things can only get accomplished out of cell range. Most of the time, 
searching for service means I&rsquo;m out climbing; no one wears a watch, cell 
phones sleep and time, as I&rsquo;ve said, stands still yet simultaneously fast 
forwards through the day and you&rsquo;re always late for something when you 
finally get reception.</p>

<h2>Conquering Mount Sopris near Basalt, CO. </h2> 
<p><strong>View near summit of Mount Sopris: </strong>View near summit of 
Mount Sopris near the Basalt.<b>CARBONDALE, CO - </b>In most of the Colorado 
mountain towns where I have lived, there is one peak that dominates the 
skyline. In Norwood it is Lone Cone Mountain, in Colorado Springs it is 
Pike&rsquo;s Peak, and in my new home of Basalt it is Mount Sopris. Driving 
into theRoaring Fork Valley one cannot miss the stunning view of this peak. It 
rises over 6,000 feet in less than three miles to its twin summits, both at 
exactly the same height of 12,965 feet. For me it is a rite of passage to 
summit the peak that towers above the town in which I live. Not only does this 
help me to understand where my town lies in relation to the surrounding peaks 
and valleys, it also affords a familiarity with the mountain that makes gazing 
up at the peak even more enjoyable and meaningful. Last weekend, I conquered
Mount Sopris.</p> 
<p>I chose a date and invited some friends, sure that we would have to set 
several dates before the weather cooperated and we were able to summit. That 
morning, we woke up to a cloudless blue sky and the weatherman predicting that 
it would remain that way throughout the day. We drove to the trailhead munching 
peanut butter and apples, and energetically began the hike. Not long after we 
began, we passed a gnome, sitting quietly next to his pet chipmunk slightly off 
the trail. After about two hours of hiking under a canopy of yellow aspen 
leaves, we reached Thomas Lakes. They were so still that we could see the twin 
summits of Mount Sopris reflecting in the water. A small pond between the two 
lakes was covered with a thin sheet of ice, reminding us that winter was on the 
way. Our midmorning snack refilled our tanks and allowed us to continue onward 
and upward, constantly marveling at the beauty of our fall-colored valley.</p>

<h2>Day Trips: Black Canyon of the Gunnison</h2> 
<p>We all know that Aspen has everything. That&rsquo;s why you live or 
vacation here. Great skiing, great shopping, great music, great restaurants. 
Golf, hiking, mountain biking, rafting. There really isn&rsquo;t much need to 
go anywhere else. Still, though, if you come to Colorado and just visit Aspen, 
you&rsquo;re missing out on a lot of what makes the Centennial State so 
spectacular.</p>

<h2>Day Trips: Redstone and Marble</h2> 
<p>The Roaring Fork Valley, by anyone&rsquo;s estimation, is a scenic wonder, 
with towering peaks, verdant forests and bucolic meadows. But as anyone who has 
ever visited the Maroon Bells can tell you, the side valleys in this area can 
be even more spectacular.</p>
