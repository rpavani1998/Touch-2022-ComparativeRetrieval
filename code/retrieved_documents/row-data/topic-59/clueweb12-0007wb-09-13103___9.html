<h3>It's never a bad thing to be prepared</h3> 
<p><strong>Get Prepared For Your First Experience On The Slopes</strong></p> 
<p>No matter what your age, preparation is very important to make that first 
day a positive experience.</p> <br>

<p>For <strong>children</strong> it becomes even more important. Your first 
big decision is &quot;Are They Ready?&quot;. Here's a great article from <em>
Okemo Magazine</em> that will help you decide. If they are <strong>ready to hit 
the snow</strong>, here is some great advice from Okemo Snow Stars Instructor 
Christopher Del Sole on that first day of school - ski school that is!</p> 
<p>We've also lined up some frequently asked questions to better help you plan:

</li> </ul> 
<h3>1)Get in Shape to Prepare for the Slopes</h3> 
<p>Don't try to ski yourself into shape. You'll enjoy skiing more if you're 
physically fit. Check out Skiing Magazine'sfitness section for tips on the best 
snacks for a day on the slopes and best of all tips and routines for getting in 
shape to ski and ride.</p> 
<p>When you are on the slopes, be sure to drink plenty of water. Be careful 
not to become dehydrated. If you're tired, stop skiing. Learn to ski and 
snowboard smoothly-and in control. Stop before you become fatigued and, most of 
all have fun.</p> 
<h3>2) Dressing for the Weather</h3> 
<p>The secret to a fun time in the snow is having the right clothing. You'll 
want to keep warm, dry and comfortable your first day on snow.</p> 
<ul> 
<li><strong>Dress in Layers</strong><br>
 Layering allows you to accommodate 
your body's constantly changing temperature. Generally, layering is divided 
into three areas:<br>
<br>
 -Wicking layer (polypropylene underwear - top and 
bottoms) - &quot;wick&quot; or move moisture away from your skin and dries 
quickly<br>
<br>
 -Insulating layer (wool, fleece, sweater) - keeps heat in and 
cold out.<br>
<br>
 -Weather Protection - Repels water from snow and sleet, and 
to block the wind while letting perspiration evaporate (both jacket and pants). 
Choose a lightweight garment that is made of waterproof, breathable material. 
There are several synthetic materials on the market and available at outdoor 
sports stores. When buying skiwear, look for fabric that is water and 
wind-resistant. Look for wind flaps to shield zippers, snug cuffs at wrists and 
ankles, collars that can be snuggled up to the chin and drawstrings that can be 
adjusted for comfort and keep wind out. Be sure to buy quality clothing and 
products.</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li><strong>Hats or Headbands</strong><br>
 Usually made of fleece or wool, a 
good hat combined with a neck warmer or gaitor will retain 80% of your body's 
heat, keeping you warm and toasty even on the coldest days.</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li><strong>Gloves or Mittens</strong><br>
 Waterproof, breathable shell and 
well insulated. Mittens are usually better for those susceptible to cold hands. 
Don't forget to get yourself some hand and toe warmers available at our 
Snowsports Shops, located in various locations around the mountain.</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li><strong>Socks</strong><br>
 One (1) pair of light to medium weight works 
best for skiing and riding. If the sock is too thick or if you're wearing too 
many, it could make your boots too tight, reducing circulation, which causes 
cold feet. It's also a good idea to change into fresh socks before putting your 
boots on. Damp socks worn on the trip to the ski area will quickly become cold 
and uncomfortable.</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li><strong>Eye Protection</strong><br>
 Have sunglasses and goggles with you. 
Skiing and snowboarding are a lot more fun when you can see!</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li><strong>Sunscreen and Lip Balm</strong><br>
 Protect yourself from the 
strong alpine sun. The sun reflects off the snow and is stronger than you 
think, even on cloudy days! Keep lip balm in a pocket and apply often.</li> 
</ul> 
<p>There's no reason to be cold out in the snow, and with a little preparation 
and the proper clothing and accessories, you won't be. Okemo's Snowsports Shops 
are located around the mountain and feature all of the apparel and accessories 
you need to enjoy your day on the slopes.Check out our&quot;What to Pack for 
your Okemo Vacation&quot; page for a complete list.</p> 
<h3>3) Rental Equipment Tips</h3> 
<p>The Okemo Express Rental Shops are located on the lower level of Okemo Base 
Lodge and the Jackson Gore Base Area. In our Rental Shop, you can purchase your 
lift ticket, lesson packages, ski/snowboard rentals, boot rentals and helmet 
rentals, where you can enjoy one-stop shopping. Visit ourRental Equipment page 
for more information.<br>
<br>
<strong>Tip: Don't get dressed to ski/ride when 
you need rental equipment. Follow these steps:</strong><br>
 1) Get equipment.
<br> 2) Layer Up - Put on final layers of clothing - this way you won't be so 
hot when trying on boots.<br>
 3) Store personal belongings.<br>
<br>
 To get 
the right boot fit, be sure to wear the proper socks (seeDressing for the 
Weather). The boot should fit like a snug hiking boot with no pressure points. 
Be sure that your pants are not tucked into the boot.<br>
<br>
 Prepare to 
arrive early enough to get equipment and sign up for lessons (2 hours before 
the lesson is an adequate amount of time to get equipment and ready for your 
lesson).<br>
<br>
<strong>How to use your ski bindings</strong></p> 
<ul> 
<li>Always clean all snow, ice and dirt from your boots, skis and snowboards 
before stepping into the binding.</li> 
<li>To open the binding, depress rear lever with ski pole or ski boot.</li> 
<li>Step in toe first. Be sure to clean the snow off of the boot sole first.
</li> 
<li>Step down. Heel will close automatically.</li> 
<li>To exit the binding, depress rear lever with boot, ski or pole.</li> 
<li>Step out. The binding is now ready for re-entry.</li> 
<li>Do not change the binding settings. If you feel that they are not working 
properly, bring them back to the shop for assistance.</li> 
<li>Avoid walking, skiing or snowboarding through water or mud. Water, mud and 
dirt can affect your bindings making release more difficult.</li> </ul> 
<p>While you are skiing or snowboarding, keep your boots properly closed. This 
allows the boot to support you properly and helps to keep your feet dry.<br>

<br> If you have any questions, please ask for assistance. We want to make your 
skiing and snowboarding as happy and enjoyable as possible.</p> 
<h3>4) Okemo's Helmet Policy</h3> 
<p>Okemo recommends helmets as a consideration for skiing and boarding 
participants and parents. We encourage parents and others to educate themselves 
about the benefits and limitations of helmets.Okemo supports individual and 
parental rights to choose to wear a helmet or not. And Okemo promotes 
responsible skiing and snowboarding behavior as the key to long term slope 
safety. Follow Your Responsibility Code. Helmets can be rented from our Okemo 
Rental Shops or purchased at our Snow Sports Center. For more information on 
helmets, visit the NSAA web sitehttp://www.lidsonkids.org/.</p> 
<h3>5) Storing Your Personal Belongings</h3> 
<p><strong>Stor-A-Ski - Okemo Base Area Overnight Storage</strong><br>
 Take 
advantage of Okemo's innovative day and overnight storage for skis and 
snowboards. Skiers and riders have unlimited in/out access all day and can 
store their skis and snowboards overnight and eliminate the bother of carrying 
equipment back and forth each day - located by the Okemo Base Lodge and Quads A 
&amp; B.<br>
<br>
<strong>Jackson Gore - Overnight Storage</strong><br>
 The 
Okemo Repair Shop at Jackson Gore offers overnight ski and snowboard equipment 
storage for skiers and riders. This handy service eliminates the need to carry 
equipment back and forth each day. Skiers and riders can drop off their 
equipment at the end of the day and pick it up the next morning. You don't need 
to be a guest of the Jackson Gore Inn to take advantage of this convenience 
option.<br>
<br>
<strong>Basket Room</strong><br>
 This handy storage option 
offers an alternative to conventional coin-operated lockers. A daily fee allows 
you to store, and have unlimited access to your belongings in a convenient and 
secure storage area with small and large baskets available. Located next to the 
Learning Center Desk in the Okemo Base Lodge, the Basket Room also offers 
overnight and multi-day storage options for personal belongings. Open 7:30am on 
weekends and holidays and 8:30am midweek, closes at 4:30pm.<br>
<br>
<strong>
Coin-Operated Lockers</strong><br>
 You can also store your personal belongings 
in our conventional coin-operated lockers in the base area.</p> 
<h3>6) Take A Lesson</h3> 
<p>Instruction helps the beginner and benefits skiers and snowboarders of all 
abilities. Like anything, you'll improve the most when you receive some 
guidance. The best way to become a good skier or snowboarder is to take a 
lesson from a qualified instructor.<br>
<br>
 Our philosophy is to have fun 
while learning or improving a snow sport. We offer lessons 7 days a week for 
children as young as 2! Make sure to check with the person booking your lesson 
as to where your class meets as we offer many kinds of classes and different 
classes meet at different places on the mountain.<br>
<br>
 Eat a hearty meal 
before lessons, and for the most possible fun, bring along a friend and learn 
together! During your lesson be active, open and positive to learn. Ask 
questions. Our instructors want you to get the most out of your lesson. Don't 
be afraid to go first. Let them know how you like to learn.<strong>Tip:</strong>
 A quick way to sign up for classes for the next day is to stop by a Learning 
Center or Rentals Desk after 3 p.m. You may also purchase your tickets and 
rentals for the next day this way. (This can save line-waiting time in the 
morning). Learn more aboutOkemo Lesson Options.</p> 
<h3>7) Your Responsibility Code</h3> 
<p>Follow the &quot;Your Responsibility Code,&quot; the seven safety rules of 
the slopes:<br>
<br>
 1. Always stay in control and be able to stop or avoid 
other people or objects.<br>
 2. People ahead of you have the right of way. It 
is your responsibility to avoid them.<br>
 3. You must not stop where you 
obstruct a trail or are not visible from above.<br>
 4. Whenever starting 
downhill or merging into a trail, look uphill and yield to others.<br>
 5. 
Always use devices to help prevent run away equipment.<br>
 6. Observe all 
posted signs and warnings. Keep off closed trails and out of closed ski areas.
<br> 7. Prior to using any lift, you must have the knowledge and ability to 
load, ride, and unload safely.<br>
<br>
 Know The Code.<br>
 It's Your 
Responsibility<br>
<br>
 This is a partial list. Be safety conscious.<br>

<h3>8) Using Okemo's Lifts</h3> 
<p>At first, they can be intimidating contraptions, but you will quickly 
master them.<br>
<br>
<strong>Carpet Lifts</strong><br>
 Carpet Lifts are a 
great way to get up the hill. You just stand on the carpet and enjoy the gentle 
ride. Okemo has 5 carpet lifts around the resort.<br>
<br>
<strong>Poma Surface 
Lifts</strong><br>
 Poma Surface lifts consist of a continuously moving cable, 
which carries a series of perches, shaped like plates, on the end of poles. The 
goal is to place the plate between your legs and be pulled to the top of the 
slope. (The only remaining Poma at Okemo is the Pull - primarily used to access 
the Dew Zone and Blackout terrain parks.)<br>
<br>
<em>Here are some tips on 
riding a poma surface lift:</em></p> 
<ul> 
<li>When you are getting on, hold your poles in one hand. Wait until it is 
clear to proceed. You will be signaled by an operator. Grasp the perch with 
your free hand.</li> 
<li>Place the perch between your legs, making sure your skis/snowboard are 
parallel and widely spaced. Brace yourself to be pulled, but don't try to sit 
down!</li> 
<li>While travelling assume a relaxed stance, keeping your skis/snowboard 
parallel and allow the perch to pull you. If you fall over, clear the track 
quickly.</li> 
<li>When getting off keep an eye out for signs warning of approaching arrival. 
As you reach the unload sign, pull the perch out from between your legs with 
your free hand. Release your perch, making sure that it does not hit anyone. 
Clear the unloading area immediately.</li> </ul> 
<p><strong>Triple and Quad Chairlifts</strong><br>
 Chairs, three or 
four-seaters, mounted on a cable, move continuously up the slopes. The 
high-speed quads, cruise up the mountain, but slow down considerately to 
load/unload skiers/snowboarders.<br>
<br>
<em>Here are some tips on riding a 
chairlift:</em></p> 
<ul> 
<li>Skiers need to take the straps off their wrists. Snowboarders need to 
attach a leash.</li> 
<li>Outside guests hold poles in inside hand. Middle guests hold poles in 
either hand.</li> 
<li>Outside guests look over outside shoulder and grasp bail as it approaches. 
Middle guests should grasp back of chair as it approaches. Sit down as the 
chair reaches you.</li> 
<li>Once the chair has left the platform, lower the safety bar. Do not bounce 
or swing during the ride. Take care not to drop gloves, poles or litter. Should 
you lose something, note the number of the next tower for orientation.</li> 
<li>When getting off, you will see the sign warning of unload area, open the 
safety bar. Raise the tips of your skis so they don't catch as you approach the 
platform. As your skis touch the snow, stand up and push yourself off the chair 
with your free hand.</li> 
<li>Move quickly away from moving chair and keep unloading area clear. Brake 
once you are well clear of your companions.</li> </ul> 
<h3>9) Trail Marking Symbols And Trail Map</h3> 
<p>Take a few minutes to check out the lifts and the trails marked on the 
trail map. The colored symbols next to the trails indicate the difficulty of 
the trail. You will also find them on posted signs on the mountain.<br>
<br>

<br> <br>
 Before you ride a lift, make sure the trail symbols off of that lift 
fit your ability. If you have any questions or need directions, go talk to a 
lift attendant or anyone in a Okemo uniform.<br>
<br>
 If you find yourself on 
a slope that exceeds your ability level, always leave your skis/snowboard on 
and side step down the slope.</p> 
<h3>10) Where Can We Eat Lunch?</h3> 
<p>One of Okemo&rsquo;s most popular features is the variety and the caliber 
of its on-mountain dining options. And this season is no exception. We have 
lots of new options for lunch and dinner so be sure to check out ourOn-Mountain 
Dining Guide for more information.</p> 
<h3>11) Visit the Snow Sports Shop</h3> 
<p>You'll find that as your skills improve, your equipment requirements will 
change. We recommend that you rent your equipment for your first few visits. As 
your skills improve and you become more confident about the type of gear you 
need you may want to consider purchasing a few items. Visit ourSnow Sports Shop
, located in the Base Lodge and the staff will be happy to assist you with any 
questions you may have.</p> 
<p>If you are looking for answers to other questions you may have, check out 
ourFrequently Asked Questions (FAQ) page.<br>
<br>
 Remember: Smile, ask 
questions, and laugh at your mistakes. It won't be long before you are up on 
the mountain reveling in the wonders of winter and giggling like the kid you 
suddenly feel showing off inside you.<br>
<br>
 While you are on the slopes you 
will be sure to see our Mountain Ambassadors and Ski Patrol Ambassadors on the 
hill ready to assist you in any way you may need.<br>
