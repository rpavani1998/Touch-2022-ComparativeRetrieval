<strong>
POLE PLANTING</strong> <br>

<p> Ski poles, which vary in length, are to be used to help move around the 
ski area for mobility and stability. While skiing, they are the key piece of 
equipment for maintaining rhythm.</p> 
<p> Over the past few years, due to the fact that ski areas are busier, most 
people are trying to make more rhythmical and short radius turns. Having the 
basket follow the outside foot through the turn can set the pole rhythm. Once 
the turn is completed, the basket is put into the snow with quite a bit of 
pressure. The next turn starts immediately. Repeat the process for the opposite 
side.</p> 
<p> Most people try to plant their pole and remove it from the snow too 
quickly. Instead, plant the pole firmly in the snow, leave it there and let 
your wrist go over the basket dragging the pole as the turn continues. On steep 
slopes the pole plant is very important to stabilize the body and help in the 
initiation of the turn to let the feet turn quickly, enabling you to balance on 
the last half of the turn.</p> 
<p> If you look at a video, you will notice some racers on the World Cup show 
their poles extremely bent from the amount of weight they are placing on it, so 
don&rsquo;t be afraid to put a lot of body weight on your poles.</p>

 &nbsp; <strong>SKI 
TUNING</strong> <br>

<p> Most skis when first purchased are not in any shape to be skied on. The 
manufacturer does a quick wax only to protect the base from drying out.</p> 
<p> Most people prefer to have the bases and edges flat and a slight bevel on 
the side edges. Depending on how you ski, the degree of the bevel can be 
altered. Slalom, GS and downhill skiers all have a different base and side 
bevels.</p> 
<p> Most tuning shops now have advanced technology and can do whatever is 
required for your specific skis. Some manufacturers have a recommendation for 
how their skis should be tuned, but it also comes down to personal preference.
</p> 
<p> Base texture is a very important part of ski tuning. Depending upon the 
snow condition and temperature, the texture of your base determines how fast 
your skis run. For instance, in the Spring the texture should be quite coarse 
so that on the wet snow the water does not have a suction action on the ski to 
slow it down.</p> 
<p> Talk to your local tuning shop about your specific needs as a base 
texturing is very hard to do without the proper equipment.</p>

 &nbsp; <strong>SKIING 
IN BAD LIGHT</strong> <br>

<p> On those gray days in January when it is &ndash;20 and cloudy, there is a 
flat light that occurs on the snow surface. With flat light you cannot see 
rolls and bumps on the snow surface which makes it quite difficult to ski 
comfortably.</p> 
<p> There are a number of ways you can combat flat light. Some goggle 
manufacturers produce sunglasses that have a form of lens that will show 
contrast. When you are on a big mountain and have the option of skiing in the 
trees or gladed areas, these would be the best places to ski on flat light 
days. Having the trees and the shading from them shows contour in the slope 
which almost makes it feel like a sunny day. If you are skiing in areas without 
glades (mostly groomed runs), try to stay to the sides of the slopes close to 
the trees. The refraction on the trees helps give the snow some texture and 
makes it a lot easier to see.</p> 
<p> Try this out on a gray day, ski beside some trees for a while then move 
into the centre of the slope and I am sure you will see the difference.</p>

 &nbsp; <strong>TAKING 
LESSONS AT YOUR LOCAL SKI SCHOOL</strong> <br>

<p> If you are a boarder or a skier, it is always good to increase your 
knowledge of these wonderful sports.</p> 
<p> Over the past few years, ski equipment has changed tremendously which 
technically affects how you ski. Most ski schools have trained and certified 
their staff with the latest technical information relating to equipment, and 
the new way of skiing.</p> 
<p> Every few years the evolution of ski teaching and general skiing takes 
giant leaps. Most of it is geared towards having a better experience on the 
slopes and getting people to achieve their goals relating to terrain, gates and 
having a social time.</p> 
<p> Ski Schools typically have been viewed as educational institutions which 
gives them a dry appeal, but over the past ten years the emphasis has been 
placed on putting fun back into the sport. Some of the growth areas of interest 
are bumps, adult racing, steeps, off-piece skiing and snowboarding. The 
interest in extreme skiing prompted by film companies has also tweaked the 
interest in younger kids to be more enthusiastic about the sport.</p> 
<p> All Ski Schools have programs and lesson packages, such as Discover Skiing 
/ Snowboarding packages. These packages offer lift, lesson and rental at a 
discounted rate and are available to help improve your performance and enable 
you to accomplish what you would like to do on a big mountain. So try out the 
new era of ski teaching!</p>
