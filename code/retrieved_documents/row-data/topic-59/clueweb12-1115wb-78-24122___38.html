<strong>Foot 
orthoses and skiing</strong> Podiatry Arena members do not see these ads <br>
 
What do you do?<br>
<br>
 Here is part of a press release from NewsUSA: <br>
 
Quote:<br>
 If you're a skier, podiatrists say you should think of your feet as 
your steering wheel.<br>
 &quot;External forces of gravity, inertia and 
centrifugal force all act on a skier in motion,&quot; said Dr. Ben Pearl, a 
member of the American Podiatric Medical Association and a part-time ski 
instructor. &quot;A skier needs a good sense of balance, particularly in the 
feet. You must be able to feel the contact between the bottom of your whole 
foot and the boot.&quot;<br>
<br>
 And that's where many people fall short. 
Most skiers' feet are not perfectly suited to ski boots and need some 
adjustments in their boots or a proper orthotic to be able to stand and move 
efficiently.<br>
<br>
 While most people think of orthotics as a way of making 
the feet more comfortable, Pearl says a ski orthotic can help balance the whole 
body.<br>
<br>
 For instance, an orthotic can be molded so it repositions an 
inward-turning ankle outward, preventing soreness on the side portion of the 
knee.<br>
<br>
 &quot;If your foot is slipping around in your boot, you can't 
transfer as much force to the boot and reach the edge of the ski as 
quickly,&quot; Pearl said. <br>
<br>
Any tips to share? <br>

 What on earth is the point 
of casting them in a pronated position!!! the most common problem i see is 
people in this position with badly made ski shop orthoses (sorry footbeds in 
most cases) with pain from the medial ankle and the lateral forefoot hitting 
the shell of the boot. in 17 years of working with skiers of all levels from 
novice to world cup racers casting in a neutral postion with an orthoses 
designed for skiers has always worked for me<br>

 Speaking as a novice 
skiier and a beginner to biomechanics, would you want to<i>encourage</i> 
pronation in a ski orthotic, due to the need for 'edging' on the medial border 
of the foot? <br>

 I would want to hold the foot as near to neutral as possible in as snug a boot 
as feasible, the foot &amp; lower leg needs to move as one with the boot to 
transfer pressure to the ski, if the foot is pronated on the orthotic then 
there will be a tendancy for movement to happen between the neutral position 
and the pronated position as pressure is transfered from ski to ski. to 
compensate the skier will clamp the boot tight to stop this movement and cause 
circulation problems. this normally results in them returning to the shop or 
the practice with boot problems!<br>

 This is from the notes I used to 
give students as part of the Sports Medicine part of our course (I no teach it 
anymore):  Quote: <br>
 Orthoses need to be shallow and narrow with a low bulk 
grind so they can be accommodated within the boots. Any additions/modifications 
to the foot orthoses must have provision for the first ray to adequately exert 
a medial plantar force to help with setting the ski edge.<br>
 Due to the 
slightly flexed knee stance in skiing which will have a natural pronatory 
effect on foot, consider casting the foot for orthoses in a slightly pronated 
position.<br>
 In some cases (eg tibial varum), wedges or cants between the 
boot and ski have been used <br>

 I can't really see 
the need to cast in a slightly pronated position. Short of a medial flange up 
to the medial malleoli, the foot will pronate over the top of the orthoitc when 
enough force is pushed through it (when the skier transfers their weight 
forward, iniaiting the next turn)<br>
<br>
 Or simply build an orthose with a 
bit of flex.<br>
<br>
 My experience has been that you can get away with a very 
controlling device, more so than you would with a device for normal gait. The 
devices for my ski boots are about 4 cm at the highest point on the medial side 
(size 12 foot). I personally prefer using 260 EVA. Have also found for that you 
can use FF varus posts quite nicely (due to the fact the foot remains in 
Midstance)<br>
<br>
 Not that carve ski's are new now, but turning on edge is 
infintiely easier than it was 10 years ago, meaning you can really lean the 
ski's over. Correct foot position in the boot allows more control, as well as 
speeding up reaction times to initiate a turn in the other direction.<br>

 One 
of the interesting and often annoying things about most ski boots is that the 
shaft (cuff) of the boot is set at an angle, not the forward lean angle but a 
lateral angle of (depending on the make and model) approx 1-2.5 degrees 
inverted the average on a mens boot being 1.5degrees.<br>
<br>
 combine this 
with a pronated orthotic and you get some really interesting results <br>
<br>
 
The point about FF varus posts has always caused an argument, however as PF3 
says the foot remains in midstance. and any time i used a lab built orthoses 
the best successes have been with full forefoot correction and a narrow grind, 
never the less i still see clients with some massively over sized orthotics 
from their doctor to put into ski boots, as a plea to these doctors please 
either learn to understand the biomechanics and fit of a ski boot or reffer 
your patients to someone who does. <br>

 Just to add to the above, 
i think it was Kevin Kirby that said &quot;skiing is one of the only sports 
were everyone could benefit from an orthotic&quot;<br>
 I am sure he would 
agree that it needs to be suitable for the patient and well made! <br>

<br>

Alpine (downhill) skiing is a very interesting sport when it comes to the 
function of the foot. One of the first lectures I did during my Biomechanics 
Fellowship at CCPM was on the Biomechanics of Downhill Skiing. Along with some 
of my skier students, we also did some preliminary research on ski biomechanics 
during my Biomechanics Fellowship. One of my students, who had been a ski boot 
fitter before podiatry school, and I did a paper on ski boot fitting many years 
ago. Unfortunately, to my knowledge, this paper from 19 years ago is still the 
only paper published in the podiatric literature on ski boot fitting (Santoro 
JP, Kirby KA: Boot fitting problems in the skier. JAPMA, 76: 572-576, 1986).<br>
<br> Basically, in order to be an effective alpine skier, the individual must 
be able to generate force between the medial edge of the downhill ski and the 
snow surface. The force that the snow exerts on the ski, or<b>snow reaction 
force</b> <b>(SRF) </b> will bend the ski, which, along with the frontal plane 
angle of the ski relative to the snow surface, will help generate the forces 
necessary to allow the skier to make a turn.<br>
<br>
 When making a ski turn, 
the skier must lean into toward the center of the turn's radius in order to 
keep their center of mass (CoM) in line with the SRF vector. If they don't, 
then they will become unstable and fall. Because of this lean, the skier's legs 
will naturally have an angulation with the snow surface in order to counteract 
the effects of the centripetal force from the turn. See the attached lecture 
slide from 20+ years ago when we used this antiquated technology called 35 mm 
Kodachrome for our lectures. <br>
<br>
 The best &quot;natural&quot; alpine 
skiers tend to have rigid forefoot valgus type feet or, another way of saying 
this, is that their foot have increased medial column dorsiflexion stiffness. 
One of the worst types of feet for alpine skiiing are those that have 
&quot;overflexible&quot; medial columns where the medial forefoot will simply 
dorsiflex with increasing plantar force acting on it (i.e. low medial column 
dorsiflexion stiffness). Most of these feet will have difficulty initiating and 
maintaining a ski turn since, in order to generate sufficient SRF on the medial 
edge of the ski, they must internally rotate and adduct their knee excessively 
to try to get their medial forefoot to generate enough force on the boot 
bottom. Firm medial forefoot force transmitted to the boot, binding and then to 
the medial edge of the ski is necessary to initiate and hold an edge during a 
alpine ski turn.<br>
<br>
 Foot orthoses nearly always can be made to make the 
skier more efficient since the foot orthosis can be used to optimize the 
foot-boot sole interface to allow more efficient weight transfer between the 
medial foot to the ski. I will use polypropylene orthoses, generally about 
3/16&quot; thick, with full length Spenco topcover, flat rearfoot posts, casted 
in STJ neutral, and often times with a forefoot varus extension to get the 
medial forefoot to be able to bear good weight onto the boot bottom.<br>
<br>
 
The shell of the boot (i.e. boot cuff) may, in some alpine ski boots, be able 
to be adjusted in the frontal plane relative to the boot bottom. This type of 
boot design is highly desirable in patients with tibial varum. Another 
alternative is to add a &quot;cant&quot; between the binding and ski in 
patients with tibial varum. However, many ski shops don't like doing this 
because it may alter the release mechanism of the binding which may increase 
the liability of the ski shop if an injury occurs with the canted binding.<br>

<br> There's much more to talk about, but that's all for now. Attached Images

 As always Kevin makes a 
good point and makes it very well,<br>
<br>
 we could open up the discussion 
further with an in depth look at the frontal plane biomechanics of the floor 
board of the boot. How many people actually bother to check if the internal 
base of the boot is level????<br>
 many boots (read most) do not have level 
base boards the variation of these is truley amazing, many older boots tried 
the 'pronate the foot model' eg. the dynafit 3F comp had an everted base board 
of around 2 degrees, the idea was to pronate the foot and lock it in a 
maximumly pronated position with the clips done up. in contrast most modern 
boots have a base board which is either level or inverted by between 0.5 and 
2.5 degrees, the average being 1.5degrees. Add to this the fact that if you 
have small feet, the ramp angle (sagital plane ange of the base board ) will be 
greater than a larger size in the same model! this normally results in the 
skier being too far forward in the boot, so to compensate they drop the hips 
back and end up on the tails of the ski.<br>
<br>
 The use of under binding 
cants has declined in europe in recent years, this may be down to the liability 
issues, or the fact that there was a tendancy to make people ski like cardboard 
cutouts!! Unless you want to destroy the knees of your clients it makes sense 
to fill the gaps, by this i mean if the skier stands bow legged with weight on 
the outer edges of the ski, do not try to make them stand straight, just accept 
that this is where there body wants to be and offer a cant under the inner edge 
of the ski to allow them to ski on a flat ski!<br>
 Personally i still use the 
odd under binding cant but many more in boot cant plates between the liner and 
the shell. Why?  ..... the under binding cant alters the biomechanics of the 
lower leg in the boot in relationship to the knee, where as the in-boot wedges 
alter the relationship between the foot and ankle, but not only this, this 
system allows us to perform very fine tuning for skiers of all levels using 
muscle testing methods. If you use too much cant the body becomes weak and the 
system collapses, get the right amount and the body remains very strong. One of 
the most important things to remember is after you have assessed the correct 
angle of cant you must remember to deduct (or add) the amount or cant already 
built into the base of the boot.<br>
 Anyone interested in these wedges should 
seewww.footfoundation.com the system has been used very successfully for many 
sports including golf &amp; cycling. I hope this makes sense and that i have 
not opened up too many cans of worms <br>

 I have not had an experience with Cants. I 
guess it something only full time skiers/racers would use (Not too many of them 
in Oz)<br>
<br>
 From what i can tell, Cants seem to be appropriate only where 
there is a large tibial varus?<br>
<br>
 PGCarter did or is still involved in 
the ski boot business (pretty certain thats how he got into podiatry). I know 
he would have a lot of good stuff to say on this topic.<br>
<br>
 Haven't dealt 
with too many snow boarders yet. Are orthoses as important as they are for 
skiing? <br>

The most common way to &quot;cant&quot; ski boots now is to grind the ski boot 
bottoms so that for tibial varum, for example, the lateral aspect of the ski 
boot sole is ground thinner. In this way, the skier won't need to internally 
rotate and adduct their knees to get their skis flat on the ground (i.e. snow) 
which generally greatly improves their ability to initiate and hold a ski turn.
<br> <br>
 I have treated a few professional snowboarders (one very famous) 
with orthoses but I am not convinced that snowboarders need them as much as 
alpine skiers need them for performance. Foot orthoses will definitely help 
some snowboarders with comfort, reducing foot cramping and improving carving. 
However, for alpine skiing, foot orthoses are a necessity for some skiers to 
even function on the slopes and make drastic improvements in performance for 
many skiers. I believe this has to do with alpine skiing requiring frontal 
plane movement of the feet and lower extremities for turning whereas with 
snowboarding it is sagittal plane movements of the feet and lower extremities 
that is more important for making turns. Attached Images Snowboarding.jpg (82.4

 From what i can tell, Cants seem to be appropriate only where 
there is a large tibial varus? <br>
<br>
<br>
 There are several points to 
answer, firstly where racers and full time skiers will gain the main advantages 
with using cants, there are many recreational skiers who are stuck on 'that 
plateau' you know the one can't improve feels like you are going backwards. 
often the equipment is the problem, if your boots do not work in harmony with 
your body then how casn you possibly perform the way you want to, at this point 
the skier normally blames themselves (the blame game) rather than their 
equipment. a minor change in foot position in the boot can make a massive 
difference to performance and comfort.<br>
<br>
 With modern skis we spend more 
time on both skis rather than having all the weight on the inside ski, with 
this two footed stance it is important that the skier can release the inner 
edge and simply roll onto the outer edge, this requires the foot to be in 
perfect balance.<br>
<br>
<i>Try standing on one foot and roll from the inside 
to the outside feeling the big toe then the little toe, which is easier? try 
the same thing standing on an orthotic, then by using strips of something (duct 
tape 2layers =about 0.5 degrees) build this up under the medial edge of the 
orthtotic and repeat the test, look at the way the foot reacts, feel how much 
and when the anterior tib fires!! place blocks under the heel or under the toes 
flex the ankle and feel the differences if you are in tune with your body you 
will notice differences with even the slightest adjustment. try to get to a 
position where it is just as easy for you to feel the medial edge as it is to 
feel the lateral edge (these are the edges of your skis)try this stood upright 
and flexed forward, again get to a position where you feel everything equally
</i> <br>
<br>
 On Kevins point about grinding boot soles, this is somthing 
which seems to be on the way out, ocasionally i see racers with this done, but 
there are fewer and fewer places even offering this service, possibly due to 
liability issues (the upper edge of the boot on the side ground down needs to 
be built up to allow correct binding interface, there is a risk of this build 
up fracturing off, a bit like the old acrylic posts!!) the other factor is it 
is irreversible, once ground the boots are ground, this is all very well when 
you can call your sponsor and ask for a new pair of boots but as a recreational 
skier is unrealistic (i have also seen people whos cant prescription has 
changed over a period of time)<br>
<br>
 There are many skis shops and 
instructors who would say any of these proceedures are a waste of time or not 
nescessary.....  with the price of a ski holiday these days (and the limited 
amount of time that we actually get to the slopes) i consider taking an hour or 
two and a little cash having your equipment set up correctly for you is well 
worth the effort.<br>
<br>
 as for snowboarer I agree with Kevin fully, one of 
the main advantages is that snowboarders tend to over tighten their boots and 
crush the foot into a pronated state, the orthotic offers a means of filling 
the gaps which helps reduce this.<br>
<br>

want to get my skis on right now!! <em> Last edited by CEM : 16th December 2005

 I attended 
a workshop put on by Terry Makos, a skiboot-fitter/pedorthist who had a 
practice for many years in Canmore Alberta. He is now in the Okangan Valley of 
BC, where he can also grow red wine grapes and ski. He typically throws away 
the skier's bootliner, uses his own and makes orthotics from scratch for the 
skiers he has treated. He has done many fitings for Canada's downhill ski team. 
Terry made a comment about not casting the skiers in subtalar neutral but 
rather, slightly pronated. I believe his rationalle had to do with &quot; being 
slightly pronated was better than slightly supinated...you were more likely to 
have your foot clatter, lose your edge and have it become airborne with a 
supinated foot. I do not ski and see a few skiers in Nova Scotia. Does this 
make sense to anyone (who skis)?<br>

If one had a choice of casting the 
foot for orthoses in the slightly supinated position, neutral or slightly 
pronated position, then I would pick in order of preference, (1) neutral, (2) 
slightly pronated and (3) slightly supinated position. Of course, it also 
depends on how one determines STJ neutral position. <br>
<br>
 As we all know, 
however, the rotational position of the STJ during negative casting is only one 
determinant of how the orthosis will work. Much more critical are the material 
the orthosis is made out of, whether it has forefoot extensions, how stiff the 
orthosis is and how it fits in the boot.  __________________ <br>

 When it comes down to making 
an orthosis for a patient to help them improve in a sport, my experience has 
been that alpine skiing is the sport that is the easiest to make improvements 
in performance with the use of custom foot orthoses. It's really just a matter 
of understanding the basics of ski biomechanics, the basics of the equipment 
involved (i.e. skis, bindings, and boots) and how certain anatomical and 
functional variations in the feet and lower extremities of individuals can make 
it difficult for them to initiate and hold an edge during ski turns and be 
comfortable in a ski boot for a day of skiing.<br>
<br>
 The approach for 
alpine skiing is really no different than the approach you would use in making 
orthoses for snowboarding, running, racketsports, cycling, basketball or 
walking, for that matter. To make effective foot orthoses for any activity, one 
first needs to understand the specific biomechanics of the activity, then 
understand the basic equipment requirements and finally comprehend how 
variations in anatomy and function may affect performance and comfort in that 
specific sport or activity.<br>
<br>
 Gaining this knowledge is really not all 
that difficult, as long as one has the desire and enthusiasm required to master 
the subject.  __________________ <br>

Hi Kevin,<br>
 I have had fairly good results with the skiers I do see. One 
difference between skiing and other sports is the gait &quot;sequence&quot;. .. 
Are they not always in midstance (if I may call it that?)<br>
 Like you, I have 
sought first neutral, or a bit pronated, and never supinated.<br>

 Freeman <br>

<br> Accomplishing a turn in alpine skiing involves a complex set of 
coordiinated movements of the upper extremities, head, torso, pelvis and lower 
extremities that allow the skier to make turns at different radii on the ski 
slope. To say the foot is in &quot;midstance&quot; would not be the term I 
would use since this term is more appropriate for walking and running. However, 
the foot and ankle are certainly in an attitude that is simulated by that of 
late midstance phase of walking gait. Maybe we could say that the foot is 
nearly always in a dorsiflexed position at the ankle with the foot plantigrade 
relative to the ski bottom.<br>

 Hi 
Kevin and others,<br>
 I have been away for a couple of weeks getting some 
excessive Aussie summer in Queensland and so have missed this chat about stuff 
close to my heart and working background.<br>
 I would agree with most of what 
CEM and Kevin have said....don't try to change fundamental anatomical 
relationships using equipment in order to ski....it'll end in tears. Have also 
done same sort of stuff with cycling, roller blading and skating. As CEM quite 
nicely said &quot;fill the gaps&quot;...get someone set up in a stable position 
so they can use the joint ranges they have as well as possible on and off a 
flat ski in order to use the edges as smoothly and efficiently as possible.<br>

<br> My background is Alpine, Telemark and cross country/nordic....have used 
all sorts of materials, used to have a couple of ski shops, since qualifying in 
podiatry I prefer to use shell devices like polypro 4mm ish.<br>
 Too rigid 
often results in skier tolerance problems, some flex a good thing. As far as 
casting goes....I prefer neutral casting to start with, but in the end it is a 
combination of shape, rigidity, boot, foot and job required.....blah blah blah 
forever. If any one wants a specific question addressed happy to give my 2 
cents.<br>
<br>

<br> <br>
 A few questions: <br>
<br>
 1. Would you agree with my statement 
that the performance gains seen with foot orthoses in alpine skiing are 
generally much more than that seen with foot orthoses in snowboarding?<br>
<br>

 2. I have never had a patient come back to me and say that their snowboarding 
foot orthoses have made them perform much better, but they often do report 
signficantly improved comfort and endurance. Is there anything specific you 
will do to a snowboarding orthosis that you don't do in an alpine ski orthosis 
in order to try and improve performance?<br>
<br>
 I appreciate your experience 
in these matters.  __________________ <br>

 Hi 
Kevin,<br>
 Merry Christmas, happy Hannukah etc. <br>
 1. Yes...agree totally 
<br> 2. Differences between snow board boots ie hard or soft etc will effect 
alterations in results...when using a pretty spongey bulky boot that fits like 
a bucket I would use a fairly bulky device in order to try and fill up the 
voids and get stabilized with out the need for major buckle tension over the 
instep and mid foot. I have often thought it is this need for rigidity whilst 
in the middle of a sea of &quot;sponge cake&quot; that makes for difficult 
solutions.<br>
<br>
 In an Alpine boot I have tended to be far quicker to say 
&quot;wrong boots, get a new pair that are right for you if you want the right 
result&quot;. The snow board boot market and design generations are relatively 
immature compared to Alpine boots, so we can expect to see significant 
development and change from year to year, as is happenning.....at a rate that 
is probably quicker than the rate of change in Alpine boots, which have been 
around for much longer.<br>
<br>
 Generally improvements in comfort and 
endurance are greater than performance as you say...but then I'm a little 
prejudiced...I think the whole snow board thing is really too low tech to be 
challenging except by jumping off things...which they do pretty 
quickly....minimal finesse in snow board edge control in recreational boarders 
forehand, backhand, forehand , backhand, there is nothing else to do with them 
really except jump off things and try not to hurt yourself.<br>

 Having thought about this a little more I think you 
could say that in SOFT snow board boot it is not reasonable to expect precise 
solutions to problems because there is so much slop in the system, and the 
control actions of forehand and back hand turns are so grossly opposed to each 
other, the deciding issue is really how it feels to the individual and that 
will vary so much<br>
<br>
 In a rigid shell boot like Alpine or roller blade 
or plastic climbing or telemark boots or hard snowboard boots precise changes 
made to foot, cuff, shell shape by grinding or moulding or under foot devices 
are going to result in far more predictable results, to the extent that a good 
boot fitter knows more about what is happenning than the person wearing the 
boot (except for very experienced skiers). In this situation the advice over 
rides what the customer is saying...our shop used to say &quot;buy what we tell 
you to and it comes with a guarrantee or buy it elsewhere&quot; This can come 
across a little arrogant but if we were going to offer money back even after, 
use we only wanted to back our own judgement not the customers....never had to 
refund much.<br>
<br>
 Obviously it is difficult to make these blanket 
statements when every case really is different and each case needs its own 
solution.<br>

agree 100% with your thoughts (did you work in the same shop that i had been 
running for the past 9 years)<br>
<br>
 most skiers , snowboarders etc have no 
idea how a boot should feel, this can be true even for very high level 
skiers!!! I recently did a fitting session with some members of the Scottish 
alpine squad, one girl age 17 who was on the squad could not feel the 
difference between her orthotic being under her foot and the orthotic being 
inverted or everted by 3degrees each way<br>
<br>
 thats a total of 6 degrees 
and she could not tell me which one felt better<br>
 or worse..... this really 
worries me<br>
<br>
 prior to moving on for the store we had the same policy on 
fitting..we tell you or buy it somewhere else...most bought and very few had 
problems <br>

 Hi CEM, <br>
 I had two shops here in Melbourne, lots 
of fun over nearly 20 yrs. One thing I have felt was that good skiers do 
usually have good proprioceptive foot awareness. Maybe this girl is balls out 
low tech speed....Downhill rather than GS or Slalom?....maybe she won't cut it 
in the end...or her foot awareness will improve?<br>
 The forward and backward 
rocking in the sagittal plane of alternate turns on a board probably wiil not 
foster the same foot angulation awareness in the frontal plane as skiing does.
<br> We have used cork Superfeet, Sidas of various materials and our own blanks 
made from thermoplastics out of the aircraft fabrication industry, but these 
days I tend to use polypro as I said. Don't spend much time in the shop 
anymore, just turn up on request to look at the ones the can't figure out. I'm 
having fun doing other stuff now.<br>
 Regards Phill <br>

 i get 
the feeling that she won't make it, but who knows. most of the work i do is 
either with the superfeet Kork product (works well for most people)<br>
<br>
 
or with either home made blanks or mutalated sidas made semi weightbearing 
rather than the traditional way.<br>
<br>
 what are your thoughts on the 
superfeet range, it would eb good to talk with someone familiar with the 
product, i have found many podiatrists shun it and a few (who understand their 
thinking) praise it as a great system, as i said i love it and have been 
working with this system for the past 10 years or so (I was the first custom 
centre in the UK)<br>
<br>

 Hi Colin, <br>
 Superfeet first came to Aus about '84 I think. 
I started using the vacuum cast cork blanks in 86 and used them alot till 
90-91. We also used their other over the counter footbeds too. Sven Coomer was 
the designer I think, an Australian I did meet back about '88 or so from memory.
<br> Superfeet has a chequered history out here in terms of reliable supply etc 
and for years there seemed to be some sort of legal dispute about their 
products.<br>
 I always liked the cork product but we found that the original 
vacuum casting method we were taught by a guy called Geoff Gray (American) used 
unweighted vecuum bagging and then full boddy weight onto each foot separately 
to create toe cresting imprints, was not that universally successful.<br>
 We 
changed this to partial weight bearing on the rear foot and no toe cresting at 
at all. We also found that the technique required a pretty high degree of skill 
and practice to get consistently good results. ....Labour intensive and our 
market was reluctant to meet a fair price for this.<br>
 We had good results 
over many years with Kidex thermoplastic or Sidas polydorane...which I have 
since discovered is basically Smith and Nephew Easy Cast...widely used by 
Occupational Therapists.<br>
<br>
 Can't give you any feedback on recent 
Superfeet product but I know it's out there. Not all that different I don't 
think.<br>
<br>
 The Birky cork blanks are a little rigid for some feet to 
tolerate in a closely fitted boot....grounds to make a slightly pronated shape 
maybe, I often had to grind out the plantar forefoot of cork devices made 
elsewhere because they were left too full under the mid forefoot and the result 
was cramping. But I prefer to use a shell like polypro to reach all the way up 
to the foot but allow a little flex in function. This I think gives more 
precise and immediate edging and also better tolerance over time.<br>
 Regards 
Phill <br>

 Hi Phill- <br>
<br>
 I'm 
just learning how to xc ski and still, granted have a lot more movement and 
inadequate balance at this point. However, I have consistent 1st mtpj pain 
within the joint every time I ski now (hallux valgus and bunion deformity, as 
well; not painful prior to demanding so much forefoot push-off). I have a low 
arch (not flat) and a hypermobile 1st ray. My standard neutral position copoly 
orthotics fit into the ski boots I've been renting but do not have any sort of 
1st ray cutout nor any other FF modifications. Suggestions for orthotic 
modifications or completely scrapping and starting anew would be so appreciated.
<br> <br>
 Happy New Year <br>

Copolymer orthoses are often too flexible to be able to resist 
the arch flattening forces from a flexible flatfoot. Try packing the medial 
arch of your orthosis with a non-compressible material such as korex or EVA to 
increase the stiffness of the orthosis. Then add a topcover and a 2-5 forefoot 
extension so that the ground reaction force is reduced plantar to the first 
metatarsal head which should prevent the first MPJ from being 
&quot;jammed&quot; by the decreased dorsiflexion stiffness in your first ray 
(not a hypermobile first ray, please).
