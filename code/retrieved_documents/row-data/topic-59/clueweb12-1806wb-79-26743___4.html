 Skiing and Snowboarding Injuries in the Year 2000</p> 
<p>Edward Heneved, MD, FACEP</p> 
<p></p> 
<p><i>This material was presented at the Wilderness Medical Society&iacute;s 
Summer Conference and Annual Meeting, August 2000, Park City, Utah. It has been 
updated with data from the most recent winter season. Karl Neumann, Editor, 
Wilderness Medicine Letter</i></p> 
<p>Alpine skiing and snowboarding are very popular winter sports. In the 
United States alone, there were over 52 million visitors to the ski slopes 
during the 1999-2000 season. This report will focus on the injuries commonly 
seen in this population of skiers and snowboarders. While both activities 
involve strapping some kind of board to the feet and sliding down a snow 
covered hill, each sport has its unique spectrum of injuries.</p> 
<p><b>Demographics</b></p> 
<p>According to the National Ski Areas Association (NSAA), the 1999-00 winter 
season saw 7.4 million skiers and 3.6 million snowboarders with a combined 
total of 52.2 million total ski area visits. (A skier/snowboarder visit 
represents one person visiting a ski area for all or any part of a day or 
night.) Eighteen percent of the snowboarders also skied. This calculates to 
10.4 million total on-slope participants. The National Sporting Goods 
Association estimates that since 1988 the number of snowboarders has increased 
77%, while the number of skiers has declined 25%. Skiers tend to be older, 
average age 31, and 60% are male. The average snowboarder is younger, average 
age 20, and 75% are male. During the 1999-2000 season, there were 503 total ski 
areas that operated in the U.S. (down from 735 in 1983). Of these, only five 
ski areas did not allow snowboarding (Aspen Mountain, Colorado; Perfect North 
Slopes, Indiana; Taos Ski Valley, New Mexico; Alta and Deer Valley, Utah).<b> 
</b></p> 
<p><b>Injury Rates</b></p> 
<p>&quot;Medically significant&quot; injuries are those which require medical 
treatment or keep a person from skiing for at least one day. For every 1000 ski 
area visits, about three will result in an injury serious enough to require 
immediate medical attention. (By comparison, the injury rate for football is 
810/1,000 participants, while tennis has an incidence of 30/1,000 players.) In 
a typical year there are about 135,000 medically significant snow sport 
injuries in the U.S. Many studies estimate that up to 40% of all injuries go 
unreported. One study calculated there may be as many as 500,000 
skier/snowboarder injuries each year. At this rate of injury for the average 
skier who skis 14 days a year, the individual chance of injury each year is 
approximately 14%.</p> 
<p>Over the past 27 years, skiing injury rates have declined by half. However, 
this rate of injury has not decreased in the past 12 years. With 
snowboarding&iacute;s growing popularity, the incidence of snowboarding 
injuries has certainly increased. The injury rate for the newer sport of 
snowboarding is more difficult to determine. This is primarily because skier 
and snowboarder days are represented by lift ticket sales that do not 
distinguish one from the other. This forces one to estimate the percentage of 
each on the mountain. Most early studies report snowboarders to be injured 
about as often as skiers. However, recent studies suggest the rate for 
snowboarders may be increasing. A report from Mammoth and June Mountain 
(California) ski resorts estimated twice the injury rate for snowboarders, as 
did studies from Italy and Switzerland. A Japanese report showed three-fold 
increase; and one from Aspen suggests snowboarders are injured five times more 
often. During the 1999-2000 season, first aid data from one large North Tahoe 
ski resort recorded its ski injury rate as 3.2/1000 and the snowboarder injury 
rate as 12.7/1000. Tahoe Forest Hospital, in Truckee, California, the closest 
emergency department to this area documented five snowboarders injured for 
every one skier.</p> 
<p>In both skiing and snowboarding, beginners suffer almost three times more 
injuries than the more experienced participants. One study documented 49% of 
injured snowboarders were beginners versus 18% of beginner skiers. First-time 
snowboarders sustain a significantly higher incidence of emergent injuries 
(such as fracture, concussion, dislocation, lost teeth) necessitating immediate 
intervention. Teenagers suffer the highest overall rate of injury in any one 
age group. Among skiers, the injury rate for anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) 
sprains has more that tripled since the late 1970s, while the incidence of 
every other injury has declined.</p> 
<p><b>Factors Affecting Injury Rates</b></p> 
<p>Regarding alpine skiers, the injury rate reduction seen since the 1970s is 
primarily due to a decrease in ankle sprains and lower extremity fractures. 
This is attributed to the improved grooming of slopes, ski instruction, safety 
innovations in ski areas, and improved ski equipment. Other factors that affect 
injury rates include snow conditions, visibility, number of skiers on the 
slopes, skier fatigue, and the use of alcohol and other drugs. Most injuries 
occur between 12 noon and 4 PM. The most critical determinants of injury, 
however, are still skier ability, relation of speed to athletic proficiency, 
and improper adjustment or poor functioning of equipment. It has been estimated 
that 44% of all downhill ski injuries are due to improper maintenance and 
adjustment of equipment. Failure of binding release occurs in 70% of lower leg 
fractures and serious knee injuries.</p> 
<p>The raw injury rate in women exceeds that in men. Women are more likely to 
sustain upper extremity injuries and are twice as likely to suffer an ACL 
sprain. When ability, experience, and size (weight and height) are taken into 
consideration, the overall risk of injury for women in skiing is similar to men.
<b> </b></p> 
<p><b>Fatalities</b></p> 
<p>During the past 15 years, there has been an average of 34 deaths per year 
among skiers and snowboarders. During 1999-2000 season, 30 fatalities occurred 
out of the 52.2 million skier/snowboarder days reported. Twenty-three of the 
fatalities were skiers (19 male, 4 female) and seven were snowboarders (6 male, 
1 female). This equates to a fatality rate of 0.57 per million 
skier/snowboarder visits or 2.88 deaths per million on-slope participants. 
Sixty percent of all fatal injuries in skiing involve head injuries. The most 
common cause of fatal injury is classified as &quot;skier lost control, hit 
tree.&quot; Most fatalities in skiers occur in the same population that 
exhibits &quot;high-risk behavior.&quot; Victims are predominantly male (85%), 
in their late teens to early 20s (70%), possess better than average experience, 
go at a high rate of speed at the margin of an intermediate trail. This is the 
same group who sustain 74% of the fatal car crashes and 85% of all fatal 
industrial accidents.</p> 
<p>By comparison, in 1999, there were 41,300 deaths in automobile accidents, 
17,100 deaths from falls, and 11,000 deaths by poisoning. During 1998, 
lightning killed 90 people and there were 130 deaths from tornadoes. The rate 
2.88 deaths per million participants for skiing/snowboarding compares to 31.9 
for scuba diving, 25.9 for swimming, 64.7 for boating, and 21.2 for bicycling.
</p> 
<p><b>Catastrophic Injury</b></p> 
<p>Catastrophic injury is a nebulous term that has yet to be clearly defined 
and is therefore not a real statistic over time. Serious injuries (coma, 
paraplegia, and serious head or spinal injury) occur at a rate of 38 per year. 
In the 1999-2000 season, there were 44 serious injuries, 30 were skiers (21 
male and 9 female) and 14 were snowboarders (13 male, 1 female). The rate of 
serious injury in 1999-2000 was 0.84 per million skier/snowboarder visits. 
There is no credible evidence that catastrophic injuries are increasing at a 
statistically significant rate.</p> 
<p><b>Equipment</b></p> 
<p><b>Boots</b>. In the 1960s, the most common injury in skiing (25%) was a 
fracture of the lateral malleolus, termed &quot;skier&iacute;s ankle.&quot; It 
was seen with low, soft leather boots. Over the past 25 years, the incidence of 
tibia and fibula fractures and of lower extremity equipment-related (LEER) 
injuries has been reduced by 72% and 43%, respectively. Today&iacute;s ski boot 
consists of a hard plastic outer shell and a soft inner liner which extends to 
the mid-tibia and allows better control of the ski. Modern ski boots transmit 
forces to the knee and contribute to making sprained knees the most common 
injury (25 ,38%) in alpine skiing. The incidence of ACL sprain (about 25,000 
per year in the U.S.) represents 33% of all knee injuries. Curiously, the left 
knee is more likely to be injured than the right. ACL tears account for a 
quarter of all medically significant injuries and half the treatment dollars 
spent each year.</p> 
<p>This same phenomenon has been reproduced in the evolution of 
snowboarder&iacute;s boots. Soft boots give the snowboarder twice the risk of 
ankle injury compared to hard boots. &quot;Snowboarder&iacute;s ankle,&quot; a 
fracture of the lateral process of the talus, is caused by forced dorsiflexion 
and inversion at the ankle permitted by softer boots. Hard boots place the 
snowboarder at risk for &quot;boot-top&quot; fractures of the tibia and fibula 
as well as double the risk for knee injury.</p> 
<p><b>Bindings</b>. Snowboard bindings are of three general types: (1) 
soft-boot bindings employ two or three straps across the boot; (2) hard-boot 
(or plate) bindings use wire bales to secure the heel and toe of the boot; (3) 
a newer step-in type binding utilizes hardware affixed to the bottom of either 
soft (stiff-shank) or hard-shelled boots and lets the rider 
&quot;click-in.&quot; Current snowboarding technology utilizes non-releasable 
bindings. Two companies, Meyer of Switzerland and Miller of Utah, have marketed 
releasable bindings since 1991. However, the industry has not endorsed this 
concept. Whether releasable bindings will reduce or simply change the 
snowboarder&iacute;s likelihood of injury remains a heated controversy. If a 
rider were &quot;upside down in a tree well&quot; or trying to &quot;swim out 
of an avalanche,&quot; releasable bindings may be beneficial. Obviously, in a 
release situation, both bindings would need to release or twisting injuries 
similar to those of skiers would result. Eight percent of snowboarder injuries 
occur while loading onto or unloading from a ski lift (while only the lead foot 
is in the binding).</p> 
<p>After a fall, the current non-releasable system acts as a &quot;sea 
anchor&quot; and lessens the distance a snowboarder slides down the hill. Along 
with generally slower speed, this shortened &quot;fall zone&quot; (the area 
which snowboarders will probably slide if they fall) partly explains why 
snowboarders suffer fewer fatal and catastrophic injuries than skiers. 
Snowboard bindings lock both feet in the same plane and create an entirely 
different spectrum of injury than seen in skiing with its independent movement 
of each leg.</p> 
<p> Current dual-mode alpine ski bindings release in two different directions, 
toe rotation and heel lift. Some manufacturers have introduced toe-up release 
binding that may affect the &quot;boot-induced&quot; injury. Unfortunately, 
criteria for ski bindings have been based solely on protecting the tibia from 
injury, using calculations based on the width of the tibial plateau and studies 
of the tibia&iacute;s breaking point, not the failure point of the knee 
ligaments.</p> 
<p><b>Shape of Skis and Snowboards</b>. Shaped (formerly called 
&quot;parabolic&quot;) skis have taken over the alpine ski market. It is not 
clear if they will lead to a new type of injury. One 3-year study suggests 
there may be an increase in the isolated ACL knee sprain and possibly an 
increase in ankle fractures (although the author speculates the latter is more 
likely to be an equipment system failure.) The recent rise in tibial plateau 
fractures among skiers is probably more age related than due to equipment. 
Entry level skiers show no increase injury incidence with the new shaped skis 
while advanced skiers are injured slightly more often. &quot;Older skiers&quot; 
who have learned to constantly face &quot;square down the fall line&quot; must 
now learn not to &quot;over turn&quot; but to &quot;follow their skis.&quot; 
Alpine skiers suffer rotational injuries as their separate, individual skis 
catch inside or outside edges. The length of the ski acts as a lever arm to the 
foot and leg, often twisting the knee (which is meant to be a hinge, not a 
rotational joint).</p> 
<p>Snowboards also have generous side cuts and are of three general types: 
free-style, free riding, and carving. Side-standing snowboarders get slammed 
forward when they catch a toe-edge and fall on the outstretched hand (FOOSH). 
If riders do not get their hands out, they impact their shoulders (clavicle 
fracture, acromioclavicular separation, or humeral head contusion or fracture) 
or their faces (concussions, cervical sprains). More commonly, snowboarders 
fall backward as they lose their heel-edge and suffer wrist impacts, buttock 
contusions, axial loading spinal compressions, and occipital head injuries.</p> 
<p><b>Poles</b>.&quot;Skier&iacute;s thumb,&quot; a sprain of the ulnar 
collateral ligament of the first metacarpophalangeal joint is the most common 
injury of the upper extremity. Since so many go unreported, it may be the most 
common injury in alpine skiing. Because 10% of skiers and only 1% of 
snowboarders report this injury, it is easy to conclude that the skier&iacute;s 
pole grip and strap contribute to this injury. The ski pole is implicated in 
24% of shoulder dislocations by causing the arm to be externally rotated and 
forcibly abducted in a fall.</p> 
<p><b>Helmets</b>. In 1999, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) 
formally recommended that skiers and snowboarders wear helmets. They calculated 
that doing so would help prevent or reduce the severity of head injuries from 
falls and collisions by 50%. Between 1993 and 1997, CPSC reported the number of 
skiing related injuries treated in the emergency room declined, while the 
number of skier head injuries remained constant. During the same period, 
snowboarding injuries nearly tripled and their head injuries increased 
five-fold. In 1997, there were 17,500 head injuries (3,400 &quot;potentially 
serious&quot;) associated with skiing and snowboarding. The CPSC concludes 
helmet use would prevent 11 deaths per year. A study from Vermont notes that 
during the 1998-1999 ski season, 15.5% of all injured skiers used helmets while 
32% of those diagnosed with any degree of concussion used helmets. Also, 35% of 
fatally injured skiers and snowboarders wore helmets. The National Ski Areas 
Association suggests that helmets afford little protection beyond 12 mph 
(skiers typically travel at 25 to 40 mph). They further express concern that 
there is no U.S. standard for recreational helmets and that &quot;consumers not 
gain a false sense of security by wearing a helmet.&quot;</p> 
<p><b>Wrist guards</b>. For snowboarders, the wrist is the most common site of 
injury, accounting for one quarter of all injuries and one half of all 
fractures. Wrist guards have been shown to be very effective in preventing 
wrist injuries in in-line skaters. However, they may transfer the forces more 
proximal, leading to mid-shaft forearm fractures, posterior elbow dislocations, 
or shoulder injuries. One survey of 21 snowboarders who had been injured while 
wearing wrist guards revealed no wrist injury, but six had shoulder injury and 
four had radial shaft fractures. Snowboard instructors advise the 
&quot;closed-fist&quot; position for falling. Falling backward is the mechanism 
of injury in about 75% of wrist injuries.</p> 
<p><b>Mechanisms of Injury</b></p> 
<p><b>Falling</b>.Falling is the leading cause of skiing (87%) and 
snowboarding (75%) injuries. Skiers most commonly fall forward while 
snowboarders more often fall backwards.</p> 
<p><b>Jumping</b>. Unsuccessfully landing jumps is the second most common 
cause of snowboarding injury. Snowboarders are injured three times more 
frequently jumping than are skiers. Jumping includes dropping from great 
heights and getting &quot;big air&quot; (a.k.a. &quot;hospital air&quot;) off 
moguls or terrain park mounds. The impacts are associated with head, facial, 
spinal, and abdominal injuries.</p> 
<p><b>Collisions</b> . Collisions account for 10% of all injuries but 67% of 
hospital admissions and most of the fatalities. Most commonly collisions 
involve a stationary object, but often it is another person. Contrary to 
popular myth, skiers are more likely to hit a snowboard rider than are riders 
to hit a skier. Only 1% of injuries to skiers are caused by collisions with 
snowboarders while 7.7% of all ski injuries are the result of skiers running 
into skiers and only 2.6% of snowboard accidents are caused by snowboarders 
running into other snowboarders.</p> 
<p><b>Overuse syndromes</b>. Muscle strains and tendinitis are probably the 
most common types of injury sustained by skiers. Since symptoms usually do not 
declare themselves until the following day, estimates on the incidence of such 
problems are inaccurate.</p> 
<p><b>Deep snow immersion</b>. Avalanches kill by causing massive trauma or 
asphyxiation. With deep powder, tree-well immersion deaths have been recorded 
in the last 10 years. Three snowboarders died in separate but nearly identical 
incidents at Lake Tahoe ski resorts in a 3-week period in December 1992 , 
January 1993. Each was vertically buried, head down in deep snow at the base of 
a tree. Postmortem examinations were strikingly similar: small facial 
contusions, marked upper lobe pulmonary congestion, and frontal lobe brain 
contusions. Although cause of death was listed as suffocation, it is impossible 
to conclude the contribution of other factors such as hypothermia, brain 
injury, head-down position, duration of immersion, and/or non-releasable 
bindings, for example. More skiers die each year from snow immersion injuries 
than do snowboarders.</p> 
<p><b>Injury Patterns</b></p> 
<p>Snowboarders have an increased rate of head injuries at 10% compared with 
skiers at 5%, but skiers are five times more likely to suffer a fatal head 
injury. Spinal injury rates are four times more common among snowboarders 
(0.04/1000 snowboarding-days vs. 0.01/1000 skier-days). Similarly snowboarders 
are twice as likely to suffer a chest injury (6.1% versus 2.7%) or a splenic 
injury (13% vs. 2%) as are skiers.</p> 
<p>Almost one quarter of snowboarding injuries occur during the 
person&iacute;s first experience, and almost one half occur during the first 
season. Skill level influences snowboarding injuries. One study showed wrist 
injuries predominated (41%) in the beginner group, shoulder injuries were most 
common (38%) in the intermediate group, and head injuries predominated (36%) in 
the expert group. Another study reported: beginning snowboarders were most 
likely to injure the wrists (30%); low intermediates, their knees (28%), 
intermediates, their ankles (17%), and advanced and experts, their shoulder or 
clavicle (14%).</p> 
<p><b>Prevention</b></p> 
<p>Preventing the injury is obviously favorable to treating after the fact. 
Several suggestions are intuitive; some are controversial.</p> 
<p><b>Personal fitness</b>. Get in shape. Regular general fitness and training 
will help protect from injury. Avoid drugs and alcohol. Do not ski/snowboard if 
you are sick or fatigued. Take time to acclimatize to altitude (especially over 
8,000 feet).</p> 
<p><b>Equipment</b>. Be sure your equipment is properly maintained, repaired, 
or replaced. The majority of lower leg injuries in skiing are related to the 
quality and condition of the release system. Use certified and reputable 
ski/snowboard shops. Children need special attention to match equipment to 
their size, weight, and ability. Release settings for ski bindings need to be 
checked before each season and periodically throughout the season. Releasable 
snowboard bindings could reduce the incidence of ankle injuries but have not 
been sufficiently studied or accepted to endorse. A proper technologic study 
needs to answer this question. Ski poles grips and straps should allow the hand 
to fall free and avoid hyperabducting the thumb. Avoid strapless saber pole 
grips, and grasp any tether with the thumb over the strap. Wrist guards 
probably benefit the beginning snowboarder, especially on icy, firm-packed 
snow. Helmets can be recommended for novice snowboarders and all skiers and 
riders who venture among the trees. The U.S. Ski Association requires helmets 
for most competitions and official training under their sanction. Head 
protection gear for all skiers and snowboarders can be considered protective as 
long as it is recognized that wearing a helmet does not confer invincibility or 
invulnerability to the user.</p> 
<p><b>Instruction</b>. Professional and certified instructors can 
significantly lessen injury rates and severity. Novice snowboarders might 
consider the use of poles to lessen wrist and head injuries while learning. All 
participants should be taught how to recover from a loss of control, when 
recovery is inappropriate, and how to make a controlled landing. The Vermont 
ACL Awareness program has reduced ACL sprains by 75% among participating 
ski-patrollers, and by 55% among ski area employees. Snowboarders should fall 
with closed fists and try to roll into a fall like a paratrooper, spreading the 
force of the fall out over the body instead of in one place. Those choosing to 
jump must know their landing site.</p> 
<p><b>Snow Conditions</b>. Avoid icy slopes. Do not ski alone in deep powder. 
Avoid crowded slopes, particularly at the end of the day. Be informed about the 
snow conditions. Dress properly, in layers. Outer wear should be of a fabric to 
reduce sliding. Wear protective eyewear. Be prepared for changeable weather.</p>
<p><b>Responsibility Code</b>. Ski and ride within your ability. Watch for 
skiers downhill. Look uphill before entering a trail. Move to the side of the 
trail when stopping. Use devices to help prevent runaway equipment. Observe all 
posted signs and warnings. Have the ability to load and unload lifts. Practice 
courteous ski habits. &quot;Look before you leap&quot; , use caution when 
jumping and leaping on the slopes, especially in snowboard and terrain parks.
