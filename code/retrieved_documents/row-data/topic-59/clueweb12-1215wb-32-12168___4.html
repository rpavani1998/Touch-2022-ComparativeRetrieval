<h1>Chimgan Mountain resort<br>
Skiing and snowboarding in Uzbekistan. Ski 
slopes, ski lifts and options for snowboarding and skiing in Uzbekistan</h1> 
<h2>Description of the slopes, lifts and routes of Chimgan:</h2> When you are 
in Tashkent, before the sunrise, in the East, against the background of the 
blue sky you can see a light<strong>blue silhouette</strong>. On clear winter 
days, in the same direction you can see a<strong>snow-white wall</strong> with 
blue shadows. This wall, surrounding Tashkent from the East is the<strong>
Western Tian-Shan</strong> Mountains. Rising to more than 3000 meters, they 
have an eternal blanket of snow that descends to the foot of the mountain in 
winter. 85 km from the capital of Uzbekistan, among the spurs of the<strong>
Chatkal ridge</strong> at a height of 1600 meters, the large tourist <strong>
skiing complex</strong> &quot;Chimgan&quot; is located. The main peak of the 
area -<strong>Big Chimgan</strong> ( 3309 m) looks like the point of a giant 
star from which, adorned by rugged peaks, rays of slopes scatter in all 
directions. Chimgan is a &quot;green&quot; mountain, a wonderful place for
<strong>skiing</strong>, <strong>travel </strong> of just <strong>relaxation
</strong>. 
<p> The climate conditions of the Chimgan tract are so wonderful that at the 
end of the 19th century the <strong>Governor general </strong> (during Russian 
Tsarist times) built a house for himself in this area. Following his example, 
the elite began to construct<strong>summer houses</strong> and cottages, and 
later,<strong>sanatoriums</strong> and <strong>resorts</strong>. </p>
<p> There are two existing roads leading from Tashkent to Chimgan; one lies 
along the Valley of the<strong>Galvasay River</strong>, with its picturesque 
steep slopes. This road is considered to be the shortest route to the<strong>
Chimgan tract</strong>, and the second one passes over the <strong>Chirchik 
River</strong> and <strong>Khodjikent village</strong> - famous for its ancient 
tea house located in the shade of<strong>giant</strong> old <strong>plane trees 
</strong> that keep the centuries-old secrets of this area and <strong>
petroglyphs</strong> from the ancient inhabitants. These days, youth 
competitions in rock-climbing are held in this area. Next, the road rises above 
the dam of the<strong>Charvak water reservoir</strong> where you'll have a 
marvelous view of this highland water reservoir.</p>
<p> The mountain skiing season here is not very long, it starts in <strong>
December</strong> and lasts until <strong>mid-March</strong>. In the second 
half of March, the descent becomes more difficult, due to the heavy and damp 
snow. The routes of Chimgan are equipped with<strong>chairlifts</strong>, a 
rope tow and several ski tows, located on the different slopes of Chimgan. 
&quot;Black&quot; and &quot;red&quot; slopes are located on the main slopes 
(there are 5 of them) which are served by chairlift. &quot;Red&quot; and 
&quot;blue&quot; routes are located on the slopes of the main peak's spur which 
is equipped with a rope-tow. The length of the route is from 700 to 1000 m. 
There are also runs for beginners supplied with ski tows around the entire 
resort.</p>
<p> In Chimgan there are several <strong>hotel complexes</strong> and <strong>
cottages</strong> at your service, as well as a rental station with skis, 
snowboards and sleds. During the winter season, the residents of Tashkent and 
travelers from the other regions of Uzbekistan and foreign countries come to 
Chimgan for skiing, snowboarding and sledding. Near the hotel complex 
&quot;Chimgan&quot; there is a<strong>restaurant</strong>, bar, <strong>several 
dance clubs</strong>, billiard club, <strong>tennis courts</strong>, and 
<strong>sauna</strong>. Uzbek restaurants and cafes, shashlik cafes and small 
shops are available not far from the slopes. You are also invited by the locals 
to ride horses and visit Uzbek homes in the village ofChimgan. </p>
