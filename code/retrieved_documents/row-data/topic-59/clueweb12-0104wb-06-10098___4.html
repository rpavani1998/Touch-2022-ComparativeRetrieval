 Skiing and snowboarding: Safety tips for 
families <br>

<p>Skiing and snowboarding are popular winter sports. But each year, children 
and adults are injured while involved in these sports, and sometimes the 
injuries are very serious.</p> 
<h2>Did you know 
<ul> 
<li>Snowboarding and downhill skiing are among the top three causes of injury 
related to snow and ice activities.</li> 
<li>Among young skiers, injuries happen most often to beginners, often on 
their first day.</li> 
<li>The number of brain and spinal cord injuries resulting from skiing and 
snowboarding is increasing worldwide.</li> </ul></h2> 
<h2>Safety starts with the right equipment</h2> 
<ul> 
<li><strong>Wear the proper equipment</strong> including a helmet and goggles, 
or wrist guards for snowboarding. Helmets can reduce the risk of a head injury. 
Children, teens and adults should<strong>always wear a helmet</strong> that is 
specifically designed for skiing and snowboarding. Preventing serious head 
injuries is everyone&rsquo;s job, not matter your age. When you wear a helmet, 
you set a good example for your children and send the message that is important.
<ul> 
<li>Helmets for sale in Canada should have certification from CE, Snell or ASTM
. These are designed as single-impact helmets. In 2008, the Canadian Standards 
Association (CSA) released a new standard for a multi-impact ski and snowboard 
helmet. But there are no helmets available with theCSA seal because no helmet 
currently meets theCSA standard.</li> 
<li>Make sure you and your child&rsquo;s helmet fits properly. Most helmets 
come with fitting instructions.</li> </ul></li> 
<li><strong>Check you and your child&rsquo;s equipment</strong> at the start 
of each ski day. You should also teach your child how to check her own 
equipment. Many injuries happen because of poorly adjusted bindings. Release 
bindings on skis and snowboards should be adjusted so that they are right for 
your child or teen&rsquo;s weight and skiing ability.</li> 
<li><strong>Don&rsquo;t borrow equipment.</strong> If you don&rsquo;t have 
equipment of your own, rent it from a reputable ski shop or resort, and make 
sure that the boots fit and the binding are adjusted correctly.</li> </ul> 
<h2>Prepare before going out</h2> 
<ul> 
<li><strong>Check the weather forecast.</strong> Dress for the weather. Wear 
layers of clothes and pack extra hats and mitts.</li> 
<li><strong>Take lessons.</strong> If your child or teen is new to skiing, 
sign him up for lessons with a certified instructor.</li> 
<li><strong>Know the condition of the trails.</strong> Don&rsquo;t ski or 
snowboard on trails that are closed or if you don&rsquo;t know the conditions.
</li> 
<li><strong>Exercise and stretch</strong> to warm up muscles before hitting 
the slopes.</li> </ul> 
<h2>Take care while on the slopes</h2> 
<ul> 
<li><strong>Never ski or snowboard alone.</strong> Ask older children to check 
in regularly with an adult.</li> 
<li><strong>Be aware of physical and environmental hazards</strong> like trees 
or icy patches on the trail.</li> 
<li><strong>Respect limits.</strong> Don&rsquo;t ski or snowboard on hills 
that are above your skill level. Teach your child or teen that it&rsquo;s 
important that he try more difficult slopes gradually and only as his skills 
get better.</li> 
<li><strong>Check regularly</strong> for frostbite.</li> 
<li><strong>Rest</strong> when you become tired.</li> </ul>
