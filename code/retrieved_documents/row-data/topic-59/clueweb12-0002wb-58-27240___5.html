<br>  Whistler Blackcomb not only has some of the longest vertical in North 
America, it also has a lot of the most challenging terrain at ski resorts on 
this continent. To get the scoop, I went to Derek Foose, who is no stranger to 
the steeps of Whistler and Blackcomb. For the past 14 months he has explored 
some of the wildest terrain around, and now passes on his experience and 
passion as a guide for Extremely Canadian. You can check out his skiing style 
in the latest Warren Miller film: &ldquo;Children of Winter.&rdquo;
<h3> <b>Derek&rsquo;s Take on Whistler Mountain: The Peak Chair </b></h3> 
&quot;The Peak Chair on Whistler Mountain accesses some of the steepest 
inbounds terrain in North America. Look below your dangling ski boots as you 
ride the chair, that's Whistler Bowl. This steep, often bumpy face is the 
gateway to countless off piste lines and tree runs. Stay right at the bottom to 
head to Shale Slope. This is the glory line on a powder morning as the entire 
run is visible by the snow hungry mob waiting at the bottom. Or for a more 
soulful experience veer left at the bottom of Whistler Bowl and head into the 
steep, open glades of Doom and Gloom. This area is perfect for expert skiers 
looking to pound long vertical with sustained steep sections and pillows galore.
<p> </p> 
<p>&quot;Next run, go straight from the top of the peak chair and follow 
Frontier Pass to the Wide open spaces of West Bowl. The entire bowl is rated 
double black and there are multiple options for entry. Stefan's Chute at the 
skiers left, all the way up to Mondays on the skiers right. Be very careful 
where you drop in, some of the entries involve mandatory air, and you never 
know whose tracks you're following!&quot;</p> 
<h3> <b>Derek&rsquo;s Take on Blackcomb Mountain: Spanky's Ladder</b></h3> 
&quot;Spanky's is the heart and soul of Blackcomb's steep skiing scene. One 
little two minute hike accesses more terrain than most other resorts can dream 
of. The area is split into Ruby Bowl at the far left, Diamond Bowl straight 
down from the top of the bootpack, and Saphire Bowl to the skiers right.
<p></p> 
<p>&quot;Ruby is the easiest, with a low shoulder &quot;Roll In&quot; entry. 
Diamond is the most difficult to navigate through. It feels more like European 
skiing than anywhere else in North America. More of a maze than a bowl. Saphire 
Bowl offers up the most challenging lines with a mandatory straightline to 
enter. This is not easy to find, and very easy to get cliffed out while 
searching. Go with a guide!&quot;</p>
