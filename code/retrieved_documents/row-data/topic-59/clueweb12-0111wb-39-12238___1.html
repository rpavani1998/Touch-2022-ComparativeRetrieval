<h2>Werfenweng Transfer Times+</h2> Salzburg: 0 minutes <br>
: 0 minutes <br>

<br> </li> </ul> Werfenweng is a small community in Salzburgerland above the 
larger village of Werfen, which is in the valley below.<br>
<br>
 Both the 
village and the ski area are quite small and will appeal most of all to people 
looking for a beautiful, unspoilt, quiet village that's off the beaten track 
for most skiing Brits. The resort's proximity to Salzburg, with transfers in 
less than an hour, is another plus point.<br>
<br>
 In recent years the village 
has made a particular virtue of its eco-tourism credentials. It is a member of 
the Alpine Pearls Organisation - an association of ski resorts across six 
countries in the Alps which jointly promote environmentally friendly travel.<br>
<br> In Werfenweng's case, the onus is on 'soft mobility' - if you are driving 
to resort you have the option to hand over your car keys on arrival and use the 
resort's taxi service or carbon-neutral vehicle rentals, along with bikes and 
foot paths to get around.<br>
<br>
 Still more remarkable, the village boasts 
Austria's second largest solar power system - testimony to the amount of 
sunshine the area enjoys! The huge solar power facility means Werfenweng is 
virtually self-sufficient in green energy with 260 households powered by the 
system.<br>
<br>
 There are small ski areas dotted around the region, which is 
known collectively as Tennengebirg, but most of the skiing is above Werfenweng 
itself, accessed by chairlift from two points above the village - these can be 
reached with your free private electric car transfer to the ski lifts!<br>
<br>

 The village gives equal prominence to non-mechanised snow sports, including 
snowshoe hikes, toboggan runs, cross country skiing and even night time llama 
treks - all provided free of charge in some holiday packages. 
<ul> 
<li> 
<h2>Skiing for Beginners+</h2>  Most highly rated for first timers, there are 
three beginner lifts at Zaglau on the outskirts of the village and two 
different ski schools that will be pleased to teach you to ski. The relaxed 
atmosphere of the resort makes it an all-round good choice for your first try 
at skiing! </li> 
<li> 
<h2>Intermediate Skiing+</h2>  Intermediates will get the most from the local 
skiing above Werfenweng with the majority of this small ski area's terrain best 
suited to them. The 800m plus vertical is quite respectable and there are some 
lovely long reds up to 4.5km (just under three miles) long back down to the 
village.<br>
<br>
 Werfenweng is also a participant in the giant Salzburger 
Skicard regional pass (also known as the Salzburger Superski Card) which has 
the widest coverage of any ski pass so far created, with 23 ski regions close 
to the German border, and even the Allrounder Winter World indoor ski hall in 
Germany included, and yet other ski areas closer to Werfenweng!<br>
<br>
 
Altogether the pass covers almost 90 resorts, offering over 700 lifts, with a 
combined uplift of just under 1 million skiers per hour, serving more than 
2,200km of runs spread over 970 trails - enough to keep most skiers entertained 
for a week at least! </li> 
<li> 
<h2>Advanced+</h2>  With no real black runs Werfenweng's attractions for 
advanced skiers are rather limited on the piste itself. Most of the ski runs 
are cut through the thickly forested slopes above the resort, so heading in to 
the trees with a guide is always an option.<br>
<br>
 However ski touring is 
the most popular choice for advanced skiers in the region, with several high 
altitude routes available above the resort around the Schaibling, Eiskogel and 
Bleikogel peaks, which again the local ski schools will be happy to take you to.
</li> 
<li> 
<h2>Snowboarding at Werfenweng+</h2>  Werfenweng's Jam Park has a great range 
of features including three kickers with 4, 7 and 17m tables respectively, 
rails ranging from six metre straight or down rails through to a nine metre 
kink rail, and boxes ranging from three metre straight boxes to a 12m elephant 
box. There's also a boarder cross course, a natural half pipe, a wall spine and 
extensive freeriding terrain. </li> 
<li> 
<h2>Other Activities And Facilities at Werfenweng+</h2>  Most of the non-ski 
activities available are outdoor, many are available free of charge (at least 
for the first time during your stay). You can enjoy ice skating, toboggan runs, 
a sleigh ride, snowshoeing and more than 40km of cross country trails for all 
ability levels. The resort has a llama farm which organises torch-lit 
night-time treks once per week.<br>
<br>
 The Family Resort Werfenweng has a 
spa, sauna, indoor-outdoor pool and solarium, and offers massage treatments. 
There is also a local ski museum. </li> 
<li> 
<h2>Apres Ski And Dining Out+</h2>  Werfenweng's apr&egrave;s ski scene is 
generally quiet with a few dozen venues scattered widely around the area, most 
of them within hotels. The Zaglauhof and Liftstuberl are among the better 
apr&egrave;s ski choices.<br>
<br>
 For dining - which ranges from pizza to 
mountain favourites such as fondue - the Wenger Alpenhof or Barbarhof are both 
recommended.<br>
<br>
 If you do stay out late, a free night bus operates until 
4am to get you back to your hotel. </li> 
<li> 
<h2>Ski Holidays in Werfenweng suitable for Families+</h2>  A very relaxed 
place for a family holiday with lift ticket prices at the lower end of the 
scale, particularly for children, who pay half price until around age 16.<br>

<br> The Family Resort Werfenweng operates a children's club. Both of the 
resort's ski schools Pro Werfenweng and Illmer offer ski kindergarten for 
children aged four and older<br>
<br>
 Children aged three or four can opt for 
four hour &quot;ski and play&quot; sessions which combine two hours on the 
slopes with two hours play. Children five and older can join regular ski school 
classes with learn-to-board from age seven. </li> </ul>
