<br>  &nbsp;Snowboarding&nbsp;History &nbsp; <br>
<br>

<p>The snowboard evolved from early pioneering work by people such as Sherman 
Poppen(who, in1965, invented the &quot;Snurfer&quot; in his North Muskegon, 
Michigan home), Chuck Barfoot, Dimitri Mitrovitch, Tom Sims, andJake Burton 
Carpenter. Jake is the founder of Burton Snowboards, one of the largest and 
most well-established snowboard companies in the world. In the early1980s, 
snowboard companies such as Sims, Winterstick, and Avalanche began emerging 
across the country. Also in the early 1980s, films byWarren Miller and Greg 
Stump began to feature clips of snowboarders, boosting the popularity of the 
sport among the skiing community. It was not until the mid-1980s that 
snowboarding exploded into the mainstream, when the first snowboard magazine, 
Absolutely Radical, hit the racks; it was soon renamed International Snowboard 
Magazine. For more on the history of snowboarding, see thisSnowboard History 
Timeline.</p>

<p>There are four primary sub-disciplines or sub-styles within snowboarding 
with each favoring a slightly differentsnowboard design.</p> 
<h3>Free ride</h3> 
<p>Free riding is using the natural terrain of the mountain for recreation, 
without focusing on technical tricks or racing. Most snowboarders aspire to be 
free riders and will explore the mountain through trees, in powder bowls or 
anywhere else they feel comfortable riding. Free riding is also known as
all-mountain snowboarding. A variant of free riding focusing on extremely 
difficult lines is known asextreme snowboarding or big mountain snowboarding.
</p> 
<p>Free ride snowboarding, where the focus is on riding cleanly and enjoying 
the freedom to go and explore anywhere is influenced significantly bysurfing. 
Many free ride purists attach an almostspiritual connotation to carving down 
the mountain. The Free riding is mostly for periods of relaxation, due to the 
relative &quot;calmness&quot; one feels going down a slope at one's own speed.
</p> 
<h3>Freestyle</h3> 
<p>Freestyle snowboarding is the practice of doing different kinds of tricks 
on a snowboard, hence the name freestyle. Tricks can either occur on the ground 
(e.g. jibbing, bonking, grinding, pressing, buttering etc.) or in the air (e.g. 
spins, flips, grabs). Freestyle snowboarders typically use shorter boards and 
softer boots than other snowboarders, as the shorter board length reduces the 
weight andmoment of inertia, making it easier to spin and maneuver, and the 
softer boots make the board more forgiving to control for the particular 
demands of freestyle riding, such as slower speeds, high landing impacts, quick 
turns, and imperfect landings. Softer boards allow the snowboarder to press, or 
butter, with ease, but many freestyle snowboarders, especially half pipe 
riders, use stiff boards that have a lot of &quot;pop&quot; to allow them to 
jump higher and absorb hard landings.</p> 
<p>Most freestyle boards are directional, in that the tip is typically softer 
than the tail, and with the bindings and center of the side cut located 
slightly aft of center. As on a free ride board, this can make turn initiation 
more forgiving and help float the tip in powder and variable snow. Some 
freestyle snowboards are true twins, with the side cut radius being equal on 
both rails of the board and the stance centered on the board. Riding a twin-tip 
board makes it easier to land switch and compensate for changing riding 
conditions. Softer boots and boards also allow riders more flexibility in body 
movement and the ability to reach very convoluted or stretched out, stylish 
body positions (known as<em>tweaks</em>).</p> 
<p>Freestyle snowboarders often 'detune' or dull the edges of their snowboards 
so as not to catch them on rails or boxes when jibbing. One except however, 
being in the half-pipe, where edge hold can be critical.</p> 
<p>Freestyle snowboarding is arguably the most popular discipline, and is 
certainly the focus of most of thelifestyle marketing in the snowboarding 
industry. Freestyle is probably most demanded because of the thrill. Freestyle 
snowboarding can be done almost anywhere that has snow.</p> 
<p>Freestyle snowboarding is influenced greatly by skateboarding. Many ski 
resorts operate terrain parks which often simulate the urban skateboard 
environment, complete withhalf pipes, handrails, boxes, and machine-formed 
jumps.</p> 
<h3>Alpine</h3> 
<p>Alpine snowboarding is the practice of turning by carving the snowboard 
(such that the board turns by using the radius side cut of the edge), as 
opposed to skidding the snowboard (where the board is traveling in a different 
direction than it is pointing). Both traditional snowboard racers (though not 
necessarily boarder cross racers) and recreational carvers are alpine 
snowboarders.</p> 
<p>Alpine riders use hard plastic snowboarding boots, which resemble ski 
boots, except that they tend to be less stiff in the ankles and have a 
shortened heel, to minimize hanging over the edge of the snowboard. They tend 
to angle their feet much more forward than other snowboarders, and also ride 
narrower boards. Alpine boards are usually, but not always, longer and much 
stiffer than free ride boards, as the particular demands of carving usually 
require as much usable edge length as possible. The hard plastic boots stiffens 
the ankle joint up significantly, making it more difficult to make small ankle 
adjustments while making skid turns, but making the board much more stable and 
powerful at higher speeds and the much higherg-forces typically felt by an 
alpine snowboarder in carved turns.</p> 
<p>An analogy made by some alpine enthusiasts is that free ride and freestyle 
snowboards are like dirt bikes, and alpine/carving snowboards are like road 
bikes. (Hence riding a freestyle snowboard on groomed slopes is like riding a 
dirt bike on a road track or what is calledSuperMoto.)</p> 
<h2>Powder riding</h2> 
<p>Powder is a term for snow that is very light and fluffy. Powder is known as 
being the most fun and challenging condition for skiing and snowboarding, 
solely because it is so soft. If powder snow sits undisturbed for too long it 
may become compacted and hard, sometimes icy. This is considered more difficult 
terrain to negotiate. Generally colder climates sport the lightest, driest 
powder, or &quot;cold smoke&quot;, and countries like Switzerland are becoming 
known as powder havens.</p> 
<p>In places where almost all of the runs are groomed, and powder is a rare 
find, you must venture into the tree trails. Powder makes for much smoother 
turns and smoother riding. Powder also makes for softer landings and reduced 
chances of injury compared to man made terrain parks, though landing in deep 
snow can take some practice. Powder is best to ride when it is fresh, before 
other riders &quot;track it out&quot; and make ruts in the smooth surface. The 
powder snow will hold consistency if the temperature stays as cold or colder 
than when the snow fell, however when the sun melts it the so called 
&quot;slush&quot; is formed. This is exceptionally frustrating since it slows 
the board down rapidly, and if it is hit at high speed, a fall usually occurs. 
Other risks with skiing or snowboarding in powder includeavalanches, injuries 
when falling on hidden obstacles such as rocks or tree stumps snowed over, loss 
of equipment, and the difficulty of getting oneself out of deep powder snow 
after a fall.</p> 
<p>Snowboarding in deep powder snow doesn't actually require a sharply tuned 
edge at all as there is nothing to 'grip' in the lightly compacted snow. 
However, it is preferred to have a tuned effective edge in case the terrain 
suddenly changes and grip is required.</p> 
<h3>Backcountry</h3> 
<p>This type of boarding started out with fresh powder-craving snowboarders 
who, most likely, didn't have the cash to spend at crowded upscale ski parks. 
In fact, before snowboarding was allowed at resorts, this was the only form of 
snowboarding;Jake Burton, one of the original pioneers of snowboarding, never 
even considered resorts; backcountry was what he envisioned as the future of 
snowboarding. Today, backcountry snowboarding is often for those who have 
enough cash to afford trips to Alaska or the mountain ranges of the West, to 
ride outside resorts. Donningsnowshoes or a split-board with skins, the 
backcountry snowboarder cuts a new path up the side of the mountain in search 
of the very best vistas and untouched snow. Some of those more cash-endowed 
riders can even hire snowcats or helicopters to take them where they want to 
go; this is known as cat boarding or heliboarding respectively.</p> 
<p>A split-board is a snowboard cut in half along its length. When apart, the 
two halves can be used likecross-country skis to ascend a hill. When the 
snowboarder is ready to descend, the halves are mechanically secured together, 
and thebindings are repositioned for a snowboarding stance. Without a 
split-board, snowboarders who want to experience backcountry terrain, bear a 
little extra burden by carrying their snowboards with a backpack and using 
snowshoes or cross country skis to ascend.</p> 
<p>Snowboarders also use snowmobiles to ride in the backcountry. If the hill 
is too steep a snowmobile may not make it up the hill. Often snowboarders use 
snowmobiles to make jumps into the powder.</p> 
<p>Safety is key when hiking and riding in the backcountry, especially after a 
fresh 'dump' of powder. Snow can be extremely unstable, often leading to
avalanches. Backcountry riders are advised to take extreme caution in all 
conditions, to carry avalanche equipment including a probe, beacon, and shovel, 
and never to ride alone in the backcountry. Avalanche equipment can be 
purchased or rented at outdoor equipment stores. Courses in avalanche safety 
are also available.</p>
