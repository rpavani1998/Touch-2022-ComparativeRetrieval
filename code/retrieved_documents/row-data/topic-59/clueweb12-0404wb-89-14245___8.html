<p><b>HISTORY</b></p> <b> 
<p>Snowboarding is an American original.&nbsp; As one story goes, Sherman 
Poppen invented the snowboard for his daughter in 1965 when he braced a pair of 
skis together and tied a rope to the front to help steer. The 
&quot;snurfer,&quot; as it was called when it debuted a year later, is said by 
some to be the world's first production snowboard.&nbsp; Others credit 
snowboarding's origins to creative efforts by surfers and skateboarders to 
adapt their activities, techniques and equipment to winter recreation over the 
last few decades. No matter how snowboarding got started, there's no doubt 
&#151; it's a native-born American sport, one that has taken the world by 
storm. Snowboarding competition began in the 1980s. The United States held its 
first national championships in 1982 and hosted the first World Championships 
in 1983. In 1987, a fourstop World Cup tour was established, with two stops in 
the United States and two in Europe. In 1994, snowboarding became an officially 
sanctioned discipline, eligible for the Olympics. Snowboarding made its Olympic 
debut in 1998 at Nagano, where its two events &#151; the giant slalom and the 
halfpipe &#151; were introduced to the world.</p> 
<p>SNOWBOARDING AT THE OLYMPICS</p> 
<p>There are four snowboard events at the Olympics: men's halfpipe, women's 
halfpipe, men's parallel giant slalom and women's parallel giant slalom.</p> 
<p><i>Halfpipe</i></p><i> </i>
<p><i></i>The halfpipe competition takes place in a half-cylinder-shaped 
course dug deep into the hill. The pipe is generally 3 to 4 meters deep and 110 
meters long with an 85-degree pitch and high vertical walls on each side. Using 
speed gained on the slope, snowboarders come up over the rim of the pipe and 
perform acrobatic aerial tricks. The object of the halfpipe is to perform 
difficult tricks with perfect form. The halfpipe is judged on rotations, 
amplitude and overall impression.</p> 
<p>All athletes compete in the first run. The top six men and the top six 
women from the first run advance directly to the finals. The athletes who did 
not qualify in the first run do a second qualifying run. The top six men and 
top six women from this run advance to the finals.&nbsp; In the finals, each 
competitor contests two runs. The competitors are ranked according to their 
best score of the two runs.</p> 
<p><i>Parallel giant slalom</i></p><i> </i>
<p><i></i>An exciting version of alpine snowboarding, the parallel giant 
slalom features head-to-head match ups on the mountain. After the qualification 
round, a 16-person tournament is established and competitors battle it out on 
two side-by-side courses until there is a winner. The parallel giant slalom is 
a series of one-on-one battles. There are two parts of each competition: the 
qualifying run and the head-to-head portion. The first portion of the 
competition is a qualifying run. Every competitor takes one run down the 
course. The men race one side of the parallel course and the women race the 
other. The athletes are ranked in order of their times. The top 16 athletes 
from the qualifying round advance to the head-to-head portion of the 
competition.</p> 
<p>Following the qualifying runs, the course is reset. For the head-to-head 
part, the athletes are seeded based on the qualifying times. The eight 
first-round matchups take place as follows:</p> </b> 
<p><b>Race 1</b>: <b>1 vs.16,</b> <b>Race 2</b>: <b>2 vs. 15,</b> <b>Race 3</b>
:<b>3 vs. 14,</b> <b>Race 4</b>: <b>4 vs. 13,</b> <b>Race 5</b>: <b>5 vs. 12,
</b> <b>Race 6</b>: <b>6 vs. 11,</b> <b>Race 7</b>: <b>7 vs. 10,</b> <b>Race 8
</b>: <b>8 vs. 9.</b></p> <b> 
<p>For the second round (quarterfinals), the matchups take place as follows:
</p> </b> 
<p><b></b><b>Race 9</b>: <b>Winner of Race 1 vs. Winner of Race 8,</b> <b>Race 
10</b>: <b>Winner of Race 2 vs. Winner of Race 7,</b> <b>Race 11:</b> <b>Winner 
of Race 3 vs. Winner of Race 6,</b> <b>Race 12</b>: <b>Winner of Race 4 vs. 
Winner of Race 5.</b></p> <b> </b> 
<p><b>For the</b> <b>semifinals</b>, <b>the matchups take place as follows:</b>
</p> <b> </b> 
<p><b></b><b>Semifinal 1</b>: <b>Winner of Race 9 vs. Winner of Race 12,</b> 
<b>Semifinal 2</b>: <b>Winner of Race 10 vs. Winner of Race 11. The winners of 
the two semifinals race for the</b> <b>gold medal</b>. <b>The losers race for 
the</b> <b>bronze medal. </b></p> <b>

<p>SNOWBOARDING AND YOU!</p> </b> 
<p><b></b><b>Learning snowboarding can be humbling but fun. It's sometimes 
said that &quot;snowboarding is hard to learn but easy to master, and skiing is 
easy to learn but hard to master.&quot; Snowboarding requires more balance than 
skiing in the beginning.&nbsp; Just remember &#151; you have to learn to walk 
before you run.</b></p> <b> </b> 
<p><b></b><b>GETTING IN SHAPE FOR SNOWBOARDING</b></p> <b> </b> 
<p><b></b><b>Watching Olympic athletes often motivates people to want to try 
their hand at a new sport or reclaim a sport from the past.&nbsp; The 
President's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports encourages participation in 
a wide variety of activities, including the sports of the Winter Olympics, to 
enhance health and fitness.&nbsp; Since there are risks involved with sports, 
before going snowboarding, be sure to consult these links, which offer basic 
information about getting in shape and protecting yourself from cold-related 
stress and illness:</b></p> <b> </b> 
<p><b></b><b>Getting in Shape for Winter Sports</b><b></b></p> <b> </b> 
<p><b></b><b>Safety Tips: Cold Related Stress and Illness</b><b></b></p> <b> 
</b> 
<p><b></b><b>WEARING THE RIGHT CLOTHING</b></p> <b> </b> 
<p><b></b><b>Wearing the right clothing is extremely important when 
participating in cold weather&nbsp; sports. Dress in layers, wearing warm, 
waterproof/resistant clothing. Clothing for snowboarding should protect the 
participant from cold, wind, and precipitation and should also provide 
ventilation &#151; be &quot;breathable.&quot; To reduce wind resistance, the 
clothing should fit snugly to the body. Pay special attention to protecting 
feet, hands, face and head. Up to 40 percent of body heat can be lost when the 
head is exposed. Footgear should be insulated to protect against cold and 
dampness.</b></p> <b> 
<p>Wearing multiple layers of varying thickness allows you to regulate your 
body temperature. You should flexibly layer the clothing and use proper 
materials so you will stay warm and still not restrict your movement. Many peel 
off layers when snowboarding, then replace those layers when stopping to rest 
and rehydrate.</p> </b> 
<p><b></b><b><i>Wear at least three layers of clothing</i></b></p> <b><i> </i>
</b> 
<ul> <b><i></i></b> 
<p>! <b>A water-resistant outer layer to break the wind and allow some 
ventilation (nylon or other water-resistant synthetic fabric)</b></p> <b> </b> 
<p><b></b>! <b>A middle layer of wool or wool-like synthetic fabric to absorb 
sweat and retain insulation&nbsp;</b></p> <b> </b> 
<p><b></b>! <b>An inner layer close to the skin. It's important to keep 
moisture away from your skin &#151; avoid cotton, which clings to perspiration. 
Synthetic materials such as supplex and coolmax are ideal because they keep you 
warm and dry.</b></p> <b> </b> </ul> <b> </b> 
<p><b></b><b>EQUIPMENT</b></p> <b> </b> 
<ul> <b></b> 
<p>! <b>Helmet</b>. <b>A hard plastic helmet is essential to prevent head 
injuries; helmets manufactured for ski sports are required for snowboarding 
competition.</b></p> <b> </b> 
<p><b></b>! <b>Board</b>.<b> </b><b>For the halfpipe, a wide flexible board; 
for the parallel giant slalom, a stiff, narrower board to allow for turns and 
high speed.</b></p> <b> </b> 
<p><b></b>! <b>Boots</b>.<b> </b><b>For the halfpipe, most participants use 
soft boots with foot and ankle support and lace-up inner boots; for the 
parallel giant slalom, you'll need alpine boots with a hard plastic exterior 
for extensive foot and ankle support, similar to alpine ski boots.</b></p> <b> 
</b> </ul> <b> </b> 
<p><b></b><b>SNOWBOARDING BASICS</b></p> <b> </b> 
<p><b></b><b>When you're ready to head for the snow, the best way to get 
started is to sign up for snowboarding lessons at a ski resort. Classes exist 
for all ages and styles, from the free rider, who just wants to whoosh down the 
hill, to the freestyle artist, who wants to perform the dangerous jumps to 
thrill the audience below. Keep your expecta- tions realistic the first day or 
two.&nbsp; Pace yourself, and commit to keep trying to learn snowboarding for 
at least three days. Then you'll start to gain confidence and feel more 
control.&nbsp; Once you are comfortable with momentum and controlling speed, it 
becomes easier to balance.</b></p> <b> 
<p>Before going out on the snow, you might consider &quot;dry land 
training&quot; &#151; practicing with the snowboard on a carpet indoors to help 
you become oriented and introduce you to the proper primary body alignment. The 
goal is an efficient foundation/stance.&nbsp; You should be balanced and 
relaxed, maintaining an athletic stance over the edge you are riding on &#151; 
the heel edge (back) or the toe edge (front).&nbsp; You should minimize tension 
or twist up at the waist, and your upper body should align with the angle of 
your feet.&nbsp; Remember: you're not skiing!&nbsp; You'll need to keep the 
upper body in somewhat of an alignment with the lower body. Your shoulders 
should be parallel with the board to assure that you are weighting and 
balancing on both feet evenly (50-50) and staying on the &quot;sweet spot&quot; 
(center) of the board.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>When you are ready to take your first run down the hill, you will have to 
decide how you want to stand on the board. Most people stand or 
&quot;board&quot; with their left foot forward, much like sliding into home 
plate. Others prefer to lead with their right foot. Your choice may depend on 
whether you are left- or right-handed. Some &quot;boarders&quot; can do it 
either way.&nbsp; You'll quickly discover which side is more comfortable for 
you.</p> 
<p>Next, strap your front leading foot onto the board. Your toes will inch 
over the edge of the board a bit, your heel against the toes of the other foot 
as you balance precariously for a second or two. Strap your other foot in, and 
start slowly down the mountain side (or bunny hill). Make sure you're facing 
forward, hands in front; keep your weight low and your knees bent. Try to 
maintain an even keel in the snow without catching the front or back end of 
your board in the snow.</p> </b> 
<ul> <b></b> 
<p>! <b>Turns</b>. <b>Turns are made by leaning forwards or backward and from 
side to side, using the toe edge (front) and the heel edge (back) of the board 
for steering and speed control. Similar to rollerblading, the back of your 
board will slow you down if you press it into the snow.&nbsp; Many new riders 
find it disconcerting to travel facing the trees or the side of the slope while 
going down the mountain, but after a few gentle turns and twists you'll be 
thrilled as you gingerly pick up speed and enjoy the powder under your feet.</b>
</p> <b> </b> 
<p><b></b>! <b>Stopping</b>. <b>Stopping a snowboard is much like coming to a 
stop on ice skates &#151; bring both feet perpendicular to the slope, then 
scrape to a stop. Be prepared to fall more than a few times while learning this 
skill. Just as in ice skating, you have to learn how to balance your weight to 
scrape the snow/ice just enough to stop but not so much that you upset your 
position and fall. These maneuvers will take time and practice to learn, but 
they are necessary skills to acquire and are fun once you master them.</b></p> 
<b> </b> </ul> <b> 
<p>Finally, unbuckle your back foot from the board and push off with your 
foot, sliding easily to the lift for your next ride up to the top to continue 
snowboarding. Hands free and fancy free, you're on your way to becoming a great 
snowboarder!</p> </b> 
<p><b></b><b>WHERE TO GO SNOWBOARDING</b></p> <b> </b> 
<p><b></b><b>Snowboarding is usually done on the snowy slopes and hills of ski 
resorts. Opportunities to enjoy snowboarding are available at many winter 
resorts and ski areas. In the United States, winter resortsare plentiful in the 
Northeastern, Mid-Atlantic and Western states. Canada and Europe also have many 
resorts featuring winter sports. Some states have snowboarding available at 
park and recreation areas. You can call your travel agent or search the 
Internet (search under &quot;snowboarding&quot;) for packages and special 
travel fares. There is an abundance of information on the web. Of course you'll 
want to check snow conditions at your chosen location. Some resorts keep their 
slopes snow-covered with snow machines. In addition to the cost of staying at a 
resort, the main expense for snowboarding is buying or renting equipment and 
clothing (board, helmet, boots, clothing) and purchase of lift tickets.</b></p>
