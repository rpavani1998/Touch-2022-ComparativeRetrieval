<h2>Cresent Spur 2-2-2 Policy</h2> Posted on December 30, 2010 by 
backcountryskiing <br>

<p>Crescent Spur has 1500 square miles of terrain in both of these mountain 
ranges, giving an unending choice for skiing and boarding, from glaciers, to 
alpine bowls to naturally gladed forests. A boutique company with a great 
history, Crescent Spur offers a very personal heli-skiing experience for a 
maximum of 20 guests per week.</p> 
<p>Stupid Deep</p> 
<p>Crescent Spur guest experience is centered around it&rsquo;s&nbsp;<strong>
&ldquo;2-2-2&rdquo;</strong> policy:</p> 
<p><strong>Two</strong> groups of 10 only share one helicopter. This means 
virtually no waiting for multiple groups.</p> 
<p><strong>Two</strong> guides per group, for a high level of service &ndash; 
a 5 guests to 1 guide ratio.</p> 
<p><strong>Two</strong> mountain ranges to choose from, with different weather 
and snow conditions in each.&nbsp; We can choose the best skiing and best 
flying for each and every day.</p> 
<p>Crescent Spur is famous for it&rsquo;s consistent dry fluffy snowfall. 
Their interior location means that storms rarely are accompanied by fog, 
allowing guests to continue skiing when others cannot fly, are lodge bound or 
looking for alternate types of skiing.&nbsp; On average they record only 1.5 
down days (non skiing days) per season.</p> Posted in Heli Skiing, skiing,

<h2>Northern Escape Heli-Skiing Announces Opening of Catskiing Terrain</h2> 
Posted on December 22, 2010 by backcountryskiing <br>

<p><em>Northern Escape Heli-Skiing has announced the purchase of two snowcats 
and the opening of new 7,000 acre catskiing area offering runs over 2,500 
vertical feet and encompassing some of the very most spectacular skiing terrain 
imaginable.</em></p> 
<p>SAN FRANCISCO, CA, December 14, 2010 /24-7PressRelease/ &mdash; Located in 
remote Northwestern region of British Columbia, Northern Escape Heli-Skiing has 
long been renowned for providing some of the deepest, most reliable snowpack in 
the world. In addition to offering over 2,300 square miles (1.8m acres) of vast 
and varied ski terrain via helicopter, they have just announced the opening of 
a new catskiing area featuring 7,000 additional acres of skiable terrain 
covering over 2,500 vertical feet of rise. This new area will be serviced by 
two new snowcats recently put into operation by Northern Escape Heli-Skiing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;While we love the phenomenal heli-ski conditions enjoy up here year 
after year, unfortunately all of that snow doesn&rsquo;t come from blue 
skies,&rdquo; says John Forrest, General Manager and President of Northern 
Escape Heli-Skiing. &ldquo;With all that snow comes some inevitability 
difficult flying conditions. Now even when the conditions are severe, we can 
still offer world-class skiing and snowboarding in deep, fresh powder thanks to 
our new catskiing operation.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>The vast new catskiing terrain features both tree-skiing terrain as well as 
wide open bowls, and it encompasses an area nearly as large as the Whistler and 
Blackcomb ski areas combined. In the event of weather conditions clearing 
during the course of a day, Northern Escape&rsquo;s fast and powerful Koala 
Helicopters will pick up skiers from the cat-skiing area and resume heliskiing 
for the rest of the day. Alternatively, if the weather deteriorates during the 
day while groups are helicopter skiing, the choppers will take them to the 
snowcats where there can continue skiing the catski terrain for the rest of the 
day. The combination of services ensures guaranteed skiing or snowboarding 
during every day of a client&rsquo;s package.</p> Posted in Heli Skiing, skiing,

<h2>Robson Heli Magic Formula</h2> Posted on December 9, 2010 by 
backcountryskiing <br>

<p>RHM provides a semi-private experience for less than the standard industry 
group rate. &ldquo;Our philosophy is &lsquo;smaller is better&rsquo;,&rdquo; 
says Christine Dolbec, manager at RHM. &ldquo;We want to avoid the 
&lsquo;factory skiing&rsquo; mentality, so our guests can enjoy the experience 
without pressure.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Pure Powder Bliss</p> 
<p><strong>Quality over volume.<br>
</strong>With fewer skiers per helicopter, 
the RHM experience is more personalized. Maximum group size is eight, and only 
two groups per machine. Flights are more relaxed and the snow is wide open. No 
rush, no hassle.</p> 
<p><strong>Great terrain, snow and selection.<br>
</strong>- 1500 square 
kilometres of wide alpine bowls, steep faces and classic glades<br>
 - Average 
up to seven metres annual snowfall<br>
 - Two guides per group with smaller 
groups on widely varied terrain allows for greater choice. Intermediate groups 
can improve powder technique in a fun, relaxed setting, while advanced groups 
can rock the hero lines.</p> 
<p><strong>Iconic location.<br>
</strong>Perched on the doorstep of Jasper 
National Park, the small town of Valemount is true northern BC &ndash; far 
enough away from mega-resort frill to be authentic but still close to the 
action. Lift-skiing is just an hour away at Marmot Basin Ski Area in Jasper, 
which also offers world-class dining, shopping and luxury experiences.</p> 
<p><strong>Value.</strong><br>
 - 1 day: $769<br>
 - 3 days: $3655<br>
 - 7 
days: $8438</p> Posted in Heli Skiing, skiing, skiing vacations | Tagged

<h2>Snowwater Heli goes Green</h2> Posted on December 2, 2010 by 
backcountryskiing <br>

<p>Snowwater Heli Skiing based out of Nelson is going green but not due to 
lack of snow &ndash; they are doing their part for the environment by using 
biodiesel in their generator and snowcats, the operation has an 18-kilowatt 
micro-hydroplant running six months of the year, and is heated by wood-burning 
boilers fueled by the scrub trees that, per government requirements, must be 
removed from the edges of snowcat roads.&nbsp;Snowwater also has an on-site 
recycling facility and encourages staff members to car pool, and employs an 
environmental purchasing policy. All this adds up to making a difference in an 
industry whos image has been one of a carbon-spewing mechanized backcountry 
vacation for the rich and famous.</p> 
<p>Snowwater Heli Skiing</p> 
<p>Snowwaters helicopters cannot run on any viable alternative fuel but they 
do run &nbsp;an AStar with a more fuel-efficient aftermarket engine.</p> 
<p>These small steps aim to make a difference and ensure that all that fluffy 
white is enjoyed in a green way.</p> Posted in Heli Skiing, skiing, skiing

<h2>How to Prepare for your Heli Skiing Trip</h2> Posted on November 25, 2010 
by backcountryskiing <br>

<p>Here&rsquo;s four easy ways to help you make it the best memory it can be.
</p> 
<ol> 
<li><strong>Get heliski fit</strong> &ndash; Heli skiing BC is not like resort 
skiing in Colorado or Ontario. Last Frontier&rsquo;s Heliskiing tenure boasts 
some of the biggest mountains in North America and the untouched powder in 
these ranges is truly endless. The fitter you are, the more fun you&rsquo;ll 
have. For optimal results, hit the gym 2-3 times a week for a month before 
coming. Concentrate on cardio, squats, lunges and a good core workout. 
It&rsquo;s not absolutely necessary but your legs and lungs will be love you a 
whole lot more if you do.</li> 
<li><strong>Brush up on your camera skills</strong> &ndash; Part of the allure 
of heli skiing in Canada is the magnificent views. Play around with your camera 
settings before you come to ensure your familiarity with the controls. A few 
good tips include using the&nbsp;rule of thirds and exposing correctly. If your 
camera is set to a 100 ISO and it&rsquo;s a classic sunny powder day, set your 
shutter speed to 1/1000th and your aperature to F5.6. The shutter will freeze 
any skiing action and help combat the natural vibrations of the helicopter 
during out-the-window landscape shots.</li> 
<li><strong>Try the Fat Skis or the Big Board</strong> &ndash; Sometimes, 
skiers and riders who are used to their old equipment are suspicious of using 
anything else, especially on their big Canadian heliskiing trip! We advise you 
to put your fears aside and embrace fat skis if you haven&rsquo;t already. A 
bigger board means an easier turn, a smoother descent and more energy in the 
long run. Try out&nbsp;K2 skis and&nbsp;Prior snowboards for free and see how 
they make your day better, not only when heliskiing BC but on your home hill as 
well.</li> 
<li><strong>Bring your Appetite </strong>&ndash; Helicopter skiing is 
invigorating and exciting. All that deep off-piste skiing will work up your 
appetite and make you thirsty. No worries though&mdash;Last Frontier Heliskiing 
knows that heliskiing is more than helicopters and skiing&mdash;it&rsquo;s 
fresh pacific salmon, heaping nachos, BC wine and other hearty cuisine to keep 
you happy. Chef&nbsp;Steve Ridley keeps guests happy with his incredible 
culinary prowess. Whether it&rsquo;s for powder or pasta, you&rsquo;ll never go 
hungry at Last Frontier Heliskiing.

<h2>Quality Winter Park Colorado Vacation Rentals</h2> Posted on November 2, 
2010 by Joe Duffer <br>

<p>It&rsquo;s important to know a little bit more about Winter Park Colorado 
vacation rentals and the town itself, in order to find a good place to stay. 
This means knowing the layout and the hotspots popular among ski enthusiasts 
and other vacationers. Let&rsquo;s assume, for now, that the vacation rental is 
for a ski vacation.</p> 
<p>The town is, after all, primarily a ski resort. A good one it is too, with 
a nice location and magnificent ski slopes a short drive away from Denver, and 
shopping, dining, entertainment, etc. All year round. The downtown area is at a 
breathtaking altitude of 9,100 ft while the highest incorporated point 
stretches into the clouds at 12,060 ft.</p> 
<p>Getting down to the vacation rentals, visitors have a truckload of choices, 
starting from ski-in/ski-out town homes and condos scattered all over the 
resort. The downtown area in Winter Park and neighboring Fraser offer an even 
wider range of rentals. Mountain homes offer a cozy Alpine experience similar 
to wealthy Swiss chalets.</p> 
<p>Let&rsquo;s assume, again, that the purpose of the trip is a ski vacation. 
If so, choosing the right one basically depends on the budget, number of people 
and length of stay. Not to mention a little comparison shopping for finding the 
right one with all kinds of facilities and a lot of space. So a 1-bedroom condo 
with pullout beds would be cheaper for a family of four, as compared to a 
2-bedroom without pullouts.</p> 
<p>Finding such a matching property in a suitable location such as Fraser 
Crossing shouldn&rsquo;t be all that hard. There are many condos and townhomes 
here that are a short walk away from the lifts and the resort&rsquo;s new 
village, and also on the free resort shuttle route. So all a small family on a 
ski vacation has to do is find an affordable 1-bedroom condo with suitable 
amenities in this or a similar location in the resort.</p> 
<p>Amenities should include everything that people use at home, plus things a 
ski resort needs such as space for skis, bikes, etc. Most homes in Winter Park 
have a fireplace and a full-service kitchen with everything from refrigerators 
to microwaves and utensils. Outdoor hot tubs and heated pools are quite common 
too, and so is wifi internet, cable TV with a DVD player and movie collection. 
Pullout beds are very helpful, and as mentioned above, can help save a lot on 
rental costs.</p> 
<p>Vacation rentals with all this and more are available at strategic 
locations in the resort, from the new Village Lofts to Founder&rsquo;s Pointe 
and Fraser Crossing. In the downtown area, Sawmill Station and Telemark are 
popular locations. Visitors can combine a ski vacation along with urban 
activities like shopping and dining in Winter Park.</p> 
<p>All of these Winter Park Colorado vacation rentals, and many more in and 
around the town and resort, will almost surely offer a uniquely exciting ski 
experience. Some make it a lot better by paying attention to detail, and 
offering guests everything from discount lift tickets to free laundry, use of 
free video games and parking garages. The single most important factor that 
makes people want to choose a specific property is of course the view &ndash; a 
sweeping view of the mountains in Winter Park is priceless. But for those that 
want to put a price on it, it is equivalent to the cost of a vacation rental.
</p> 
<p>You can get the most out of your winter holiday by choosing Winter Park 
Colorado vacation rentals. You can arrange for Colorado ski vacation rentals 
easily and quickly, using your Internet connection.</p> Posted in skiing
