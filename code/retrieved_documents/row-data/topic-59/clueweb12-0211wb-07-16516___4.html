<h1>Banff<br>
Lake Louise Mountain Resort<br>
Mt. Norquay<br>
Sunshine Village
</h1> 
<p></p> 
<p>  Banff is one of the most popular winter resort destinations in Canada 
&ndash; not only is the town of Banff a popular destination in and of itself, 
with a number of great mountains surrounding it such as Mount Rundle, Sulphur 
Mountain, Mt Norquay and Cascade Mountain, the town of Banff and the nearby 
town of Lake Louise are close enough to the ski resorts of Sunshine Village and 
Ski Norquay to provide an excellent place to stay while snowboarding at either 
one of those popular resorts.<br>
<br>
 Banff National Park is host to three of 
the world renowned ski resorts; The Lake Louise Ski Area, Sunshine Village and 
Mt. Norquay. This spectacularly scenic area offers a tri-area lift ticket that 
is good at the resorts and free transportation between Banff-Lake Louise and 
the three resorts.<br>
<br>
 The Sunshine Village Ski Resort is one of the most 
popular regional ski resorts, yet it manages to provide an uncrowded 
snowboarding / skiing experience with over three thousand and three hundred 
acres of terrain in total. The average snowfall for the Sunshine Village Ski 
Resort is more than thirty feet per year, and as a result the Sunshine Village 
Ski Resort is known for having an exceptionally long open season which lasts 
from the middle of November until the end of May.<br>
<br>
 There are three 
mountains at the Sunshine Village Ski Resort, called Goat&rsquo;s Eye, Lookout 
and Standish. These mountains are home to more than one hundred and seven runs. 
Twelve lifts serve the system of trails, with a lift capacity of twenty 
thousand people per hour making it easy to get to the top without ever having 
to wait in line. Sunshine Village Ski Resort has a terrific vertical drop of 
just over three thousand and five hundred feet which lets you get in some truly 
epic runs.<br>
<br>
 The challenge levels at the Sunshine Village Ski Resort 
are also well varied, with twenty percent of the runs being geared towards 
beginners, fifty five percent being more for intermediate snowboarders and 
twenty five percent being well suited for expert level snowboarders and skiers. 
There is also the Rogers Terrain Park for snowboarders, which provides eight 
acres of terrain including a great selection of boxes, jumps and rails.<br>
<br>
 An A-frame box, a whale tail box, a nutcracker rail, a 20 foot handrail, a 
banked C box, an old blue rail, a C bow box, a stepdown box, a 40 foot rail, a 
coffin box, a down box, a Dr. Suess rail, a flat / down rail, a rainbow rail, 
an up box, a right hip jump and a pyramid are just a few of the great pieces of 
equipment that you can work off of at the Rogers Terrain Park at Sunshine 
Village Ski Resort.<br>
<br>
 Ski Norquay offers a snowboarding / skiing 
experience which is more geared to families, making it easier for younger 
children as well as large groups to have a good time learning how to ski and 
racing down the gentle slopes. While there are also more difficult runs for you 
to try at Ski Norquay, it provides an easier experience overall for lots of 
people to come and enjoy.<br>
<br>
 The Banff area is filled with great runs, 
great back country and lots of great resorts where you can have a great time 
developing your snowboarding skills or just playing around!<br>
<br>
 Today, 
Alberta has seven impressive, destination ski resorts: Banff, Fortress 
Mountain, The Lake Louise Ski Area, Marmot Basin, Mystic Ridge/Norquay, Nakiska 
and Sunshine Village. And don't forget about their six heli-skiing operators!
<br> <br>
 For some, a trip to Alberta is not complete unless it includes a 
side trip to the West Edmonton Mall--the world's largest shopping and 
entertainment complex with a wave pool, triple-loop roller coaster, shark tank, 
ice rink, trained dolphins and an indoor beach.<br>
<br>
 Alberta is easy to 
get to. Simply fly into Calgary or Edmonton and rent a car, or take scheduled 
shuttle bus service to the ski resorts. And yes, it's still possible to take a 
sleeper train--just like those first tourists-- right into downtown Jasper. If 
you have the time, the VIA Rail journey from Vancouver in the west or Montreal 
in the east, is an unforgettable experience.<br>
