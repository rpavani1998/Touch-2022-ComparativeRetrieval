<h1>Competition</h1> 
<p>Snowboarding purists and competition don't mix. Hey &ndash; it's meant to 
be about self&ndash;expression and personal enjoyment. But here's the truth 
&ndash; good riders still like to be measured against the best, and 
world&ndash;class riders can make a lot of money.</p> <br>
<br>

<h3>UK competitions</h3> 
<p>There are regular snowboard competitions on the UK's artificial slopes, 
indoor snow slopes and the Scottish Ski areas &ndash; all great places to start 
competing. Just check out theSnowlife events diary.</p> 
<p>The main snowboard competition circuit in the UK is the British Snow Tour. 
To take part you'll need to register, visit the British Snow Tour website.</p> 
<br> <br>

<p>There is a full half&ndash;pipe at the Sheffield Ski Village. It plays host 
to a number of competitions, and is perfect for practising moves before heading 
into a real snow half pipe. Sheffield also has the National Aerials Water Ramp. 
Although it was designed for freestyle skiing, the ramp was instantly adopted 
by the snowboard big air specialists.</p> 
<p>For more information on the UK snowboarding visit the Soulsports website 
and theSnowboard Club UK.</p> <br>
<br>

<h3>International competitions</h3> 
<p>The International competition circuit is made up of independent events in 
various disciplines and an established World Cup Series run by FIS 
(International Ski Federation).</p> 
<p>FIS is the governing body for skiing, and started to run World Cup 
snowboard competitions in 1995. It was also responsible for getting 
snowboarding into the 1998 Winter Olympics in Nagano, Japan. British half pipe 
star Lesley McKenna made history in 2002 in Salt Lake City as the first British 
snowboarder to compete in the Winter Olympics.</p> 
<p>To compete on the FIS tour you must have a FIS Licence, which is issued by 
Snowsport GB. To move to the international stage you need to be performing to a 
very high level at national competitions. An international licence gives access 
to open and then European events. World Cup events have entry restrictions and 
are usually for British Team members only (FIS).</p> 
<p>Independent international competitions such as Air and Style, Verbier Ride, 
Bomb comp and Cham Jam are open events held in Europe for both the pros and 
aspiring rider alike. TheSnowlife events diary has dates and website links to 
European events happening this year.</p> <br>
<br>

<h3>Parallel Slalom and Giant Slalom</h3> 
<p>Think fast. Very fast. Competitors race down a course of tightly set 
control gates against the clock. As well as Slalom, competitors can also 
compete in giant slalom (control gates set wider apart), parallel slalom (two 
riders race head to head on identical courses set beside each other) and 
parallel giant slalom.</p> <br>
<br>

<h3>Boardercross (Olympic discipline)</h3> 
<p>This is where competition gets gladiatorial (although deliberate bodily 
contact is a strict no-no). Groups of four or six riders start together and 
descend a specially built course which mix up banked turns, jumps, waves and 
other variations in the terrain. First across the line wins and moves on to the 
next round.</p> 
<p>Let the best boarder win.</p> 
<h3>Half Pipe (Olympic discipline)</h3> 
<p>The pipe is the ultimate playground for tricks on a snowboard. The 
snowboard half pipe involves riding from wall to wall in a pipe around 110 
metres long, 15 metres wide The average gradient is 17 degrees, and the walls 
around four metres high.</p> 
<p>Riders take off and perform a huge range of manoeuvres. Some are borrowed 
from other sports such as skateboarding, while others are exclusive to 
snowboarding. Riders take to the pipe one at a time, with judges marking on 
degree of difficulty and execution.</p> 
<h3>Big Air</h3> 
<p>The title says it all. Take a big jump. Add a good run in, landing zone and 
plenty of music. Go for it. The moves get wilder every year, as the impossible 
becomes the humdrum. Inverted manoeuvres with ever more difficult combinations 
of twists, rolls, hand grabs, reverse landings and spins provide great 
entertainment. Judges award points for the degree of difficulty and the 
execution.</p> 
<h3>Slopestyle</h3> 
<p>The rider performs a variation of tricks back to back over a course of 
obstacles including jumps, halfpipe, hips, rails and fun boxes.</p> <br>
