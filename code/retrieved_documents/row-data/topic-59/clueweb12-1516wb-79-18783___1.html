<h2>How to Select the Perfect Snowboard</h2> 
<p>without comments</p> 
<p>The snowboard market used to be fairly simple and easy to maneuver. There 
were the top brands with the top boards, then a few others struggling to keep 
up. Today, things are very different. The most expensive brands don&rsquo;t 
always have the best boards and the lesser known brand names can always be the 
upcoming big names. The market is a lot more difficult to maneuver.</p> 
<p>Since the sport of snowboarding has advanced, there are also more types of 
snowboards today, including:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Park Boards</li> 
<li>Freeride Boards</li> 
<li>Freestyle Boards</li> 
<li>Rail Boards</li> 
<li>All-Mountain Boards</li> 
<li>Powder Boards</li> </ul> 
<p>When looking&nbsp;for the <strong>perfect&nbsp;snowboard</strong>, you will 
analyze its height, width, and shape. This will be measured against your 
weight, height, foot size, and your snowboarding style to determine which board 
is perfect for you. In order to make the right decision, there are a few 
questions to ask yourself when considering a board.</p> 
<p><em><strong>1.&nbsp; How skilled are you at snowboarding right now?</strong>
</em></p> 
<p>Here are some of the optional answers for this question:</p> 
<p>*Beginner: first time rider, just starting out with little experience, or 
signing up for your first lessons.</p> 
<p>* Intermediate: some experience boarding at least three times a year, can 
catch some air and do some minor tricks, able to turn without wiping out.</p> 
<p>* Advanced: snowboarding at least five times a year, extreme comfort on the 
board, able to do some tricks with comfort.</p> 
<p><em><strong>2.&nbsp; What is your riding style?</strong></em></p> 
<p>What type of board you need is directly tied to the terrain that you will 
ride on most often and your chosen style. Not sure of your style? Here is a 
quick rundown for comparison:</p> 
<p>* All-Mountain or Freeride: the entire mountain is your domain. You love it 
all from carving and catching air to making&nbsp; elaborate turns in fresh 
powder. Of course, just gliding over the slopes leisurely is fun as well.</p> 
<p>* Freestyle: the tricks are your thing. From jumping, spinning, grabbing 
and jibbing to hitting the rails, you are all over anything daring. Your ideal 
board should be very short or very stiff, depending on whether you prefer 
buttering and jumping to hanging out in the pipe.</p> 
<p>* Alpine/Carve: you get off on the speed and deep turns. You hit the 
mountain hard and nail one turn right after the other. There is no speed too 
intense for you.</p> 
<p><em><strong>3. What are your measurements?</strong></em></p> 
<p>Take your measurements and keep the following in mind:</p> 
<p>* Length: if you are an all-mountain boarder, your board should be a bit 
longer. It should be shorter if you are a freestyle boarder, so you can get 
into faster spins and comfortably apply more pressure to the tail.</p> 
<p>* Width: the width of your board depends on the size of your feet. Make 
sure you can move your feet without heels or toes hitting down into the snow on 
a turn.</p> 
<p>* Weight: you may not like your weight, but this is not the time to 
underestimate it. If you are a bit on the heavy side, your board needs a 
stiffer flex and should be longer. If you tend to be a lightweight, then a 
softer flex on a shorter board is ideal. If you are very short, understand that 
you won&rsquo;t be able to adequately control a long board.</p> 
<p>Are you ready to select your&nbsp;perfect snowboard? There are just three 
more factors that you need to take into consideration:</p> 
<p><em><strong>1. Selecting a Brand</strong></em></p> 
<p>For the most part, you will get better warranties and more reliable 
customer support services from the bigger, best known brands. If you 
don&rsquo;t know what the top brands are, then ask someone in your sports shop 
or rental shop.</p> 
<p><em><strong>2. Settling on Price</strong></em></p> 
<p>Your board will cost at least a hundred bucks, but could easily go up to 
six hundred or more. Look at different price ranges for different brands, but 
understand that the top priced boards are typically designed for professional 
riders. A beginner will not need the advanced technology built into these 
higher tech boards.</p> 
<p><em><strong>3. Choosing Graphics</strong></em></p> 
<p>This is the most fun part of picking out your perfect snowboard. 
Manufacturers are getting wild with the designs and color schemes, which allows 
you to display your personality and speak your mind in a unique manner. Have 
some fun looking at the different designs and find something that fits your 
personality.</p> 
<p>One thing to watch out for is selecting your graphic design before looking 
at all of the technical features addressed above. You should pick out the right 
size and style before even looking at design. Functionality and performance has 
to top style and personality.</p> 
<p>Are You Ready to Make a Purchase?</p> 
<p>You may feel you are ready to make your first snowboard purchase&hellip;but 
hold off! Don&rsquo;t do that before renting a board or two first. You can try 
out a variety of styles and sizes without putting your money on the line if you 
just rent at first. You can even rent boots, if you aren&rsquo;t sure about 
purchasing those as well. You can find rentals at local sporting goods stores 
or at snowboarding destinations. Make sure to do this at least a day in advance 
so you are sure to find something that fits you properly.</p> 
<p>If you are interested in purchasing a used board, make sure that it still 
has enough life left to justify the price. Otherwise, you will spend a lot of 
money on a board that doesn&rsquo;t do well in action. First, look at the 
rails, which are the metal edges on the board. Make sure the rails do not have 
cracks and are firmly attached to the board. The top of the board should be 
checked for cracks, since cracks here tell you that the board has been ridden 
hard and may be worn out.</p> 
<p>Also look at the base of the board to make sure there are no large nicks in 
the board. Check that the rails are not separating from the board on the 
underside as well. In some cases, a hole can be fixed, but you may not want to 
go through that hassle.</p> 
<p>Another way of saving some money is to look at new boards that are from 
last year. A lot of last year markdowns take place during the summer months, 
since shops are making room for the newer models for the upcoming season.</p> 
<p>Finally, ask your local shops about boards that used to be on display in 
the store. These demo boards are eventually taken down and are often sold at 
reduced price. You may even be able to purchase older rental boards at bargain 
prices, but make sure they are still in good condition.</p> 
<p>Follow the above guidelines and your on your way to finding the perfect 
snowboard.</p>
