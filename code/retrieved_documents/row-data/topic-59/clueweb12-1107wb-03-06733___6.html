<h1>Let us help you make your decision...</h1> 
<p>When deciding on the best course for you, consider: <br>
 1) What do you 
want to get out of the course?<br>
 2) How long do you want to spend on a 
course?<br>
 3) What is your current skiing / snowboarding level? All of these 
are answered in the advice below.</p> 
<h2> Which phrase applies to you the most? </h2> 
<h2>I want to become an <br>
 instructor</h2> &gt;&gt; <br>

<h2>I want my skiing/riding to <br>
significantly improve</h2> &gt;&gt; <br>

<h2>I want to do a <br>
winter season</h2> &gt;&gt; <br>

<h2>I'm looking for a holiday <br>
with a difference</h2> &gt;&gt; <br>

<h2> What ability do I need to be? </h2> 
<p>The chart below shows a rough outline of the <strong>MINIMUM </strong>
standard you need to be to come on any of our courses. There is no maximum 
standard; many of our clients have already done several seasons before they 
join our courses. Every season we have the satisfaction of witnessing not only 
timid novices transform into tidy advanced skiers and snowboarders, while 
already confident experts rid their bad habits and push themselves further than 
they have previously done.</p> 
<p>The table below is a guide only; everyone improves at different rates due 
to instruction, fitness and natural ability. We are often able to customise a 
package to suit your needs such as organising for you to arrive a few weeks 
before the start of the course to bring you up to standard. If you have any 
queries or are worried that your ability might not be suitable for one of our 
courses please give us a call.</p>

<h2> 11-Week &amp; Instructor Courses: Average age </h2> 
<h2> Guide to ski experience levels (scroll down if you're a snowboarder) </h2>
Thirsty for More 1. Skiing is a new hobby of yours but you&rsquo;re hooked and 
want to learn more.<br>
<br>

<p>2. You are more than comfortable with snow plough turns and are progressing 
into parallel turns, but at times you find it difficult to turn when you want 
to.</p> 
<p>3. At the start of the turn you use a little snowplough to begin the 
direction change and then finish with parallel skis.</p> 
<p>4. You are prepared to ski outside your comfort zone (within reason) in 
order to ski steeper terrain and develop your skills.<br>
<br>
 5. You have 
skied easier blue runs but steep blues and black runs are still intimidating.
</p> <br>
Rising Star 
<p>1. You are becoming more confident on your skis and can turn when you want 
to and if you need to.</p> 
<p>2. You are skiing increasingly steeper terrain (steeper blue runs, some 
easy blacks or the equivalent European Reds)</p> 
<p>3. The snowplough at the start of your turn is only evident when the 
terrain is particularly difficult or steep, but in easier terrain you are 
almost always parallel.</p> 
<p>4. You are beginning to understand the concept of carving and are starting 
to ski at speed with both skis running on an edge.</p> 
<p>5. You are happy to explore easier off-piste and un-groomed terrain.</p> 
<p></p> <br>
Intrepid Explorer 
<p>1. You are a confident skier who enjoys skiing a variety of terrain 
(including powder), but needs coaching to iron out bad habits.</p> 
<p>2. You enjoy skiing black runs and fast on groomed runs.</p> 
<p>3. You can adapt your turns to suit the terrain and vary between steered 
shorter turns and longer carved turns.</p> 
<p>4. You are willing to push your skiing in moguls and trees but need 
practice and coaching to really feel comfortable.</p> 
<p>5. Steep un-groomed black runs and challenging off-piste cause bad habits 
to return.</p> <br>
The Mountain Tamer 1. You have been skiing for years and 
are comfortable when asked to ski almost any terrain.<br>
<br>
 2. You can make 
adjustments in your skiing to allow for changing conditions whilst moving e.g. 
when skiing from groomed to un-groomed or from a shallow pitch to a steeper 
pitch.<br>
<br>
 3. You have experience skiing trees, moguls, powder, choppy 
snow, ice and any other condition the mountain can throw up, even if you cannot 
always ski it with style.<br>
<br>
 4. You feel like you can ski anything but 
would like to be able to refine your technique and improve your control.<br>

<br> 5. You can carve at speed down black runs. <br>
<br>

<p></p> 
<h2> Guide to snowboard experience levels </h2> Thirsty for More 1. 
Snowboarding is a new hobby of yours but you are hooked and want to learn more.
<br> <br>

<p>2. You can link turns on green runs (a linked turn is changing from one 
edge to the opposite edge).</p> 
<p>3. You have a preferred edge you like being on and will side slip when the 
terrain gets too hard.</p> 
<p>4. You have ridden down easier blue runs but steep blues and blacks are 
still intimidating.<br>
<br>
 5. You are reluctant to point your board down the 
hill.</p> <br>
Rising Star 1. Your confidence on a board is growing and you can 
change edges as and when you need too.<br>
<br>
 2. You are exploring steeper 
terrain (blues and easier blacks or equivalent European reds) and making an 
effort not to side slip through difficult sections, but at times you have to 
revert to side slipping.<br>
<br>
 3. You are prepared and comfortable when 
pointing your board down the hill on easier blue terrain.<br>
<br>
 4. You have 
felt the sensation of &lsquo;carving&rsquo; and being on an edge at speed.<br>

<br> 5. You are happy too explore easier off-piste and un-groomed terrain.<br>

<br> 6. You have toyed with riding switch but it is pretty uncomfortable. <br>

Intrepid Explorer 1. You are a confident snowboarder who enjoys riding a 
variety of terrain (including powder) but needs coaching to iron out bad habits.
<br> <br>

<p>2. You enjoy snowboarding on black runs and going fast on groomed terrain.
</p> 
<p>3. You can vary the size of your turn to suit the terrain.</p> 
<p>4. Riding switch is becoming more comfortable and you willingly try it on a 
regular basis.</p> 
<p>5. You are willing to push your riding in trees, moguls and steeps but need 
coaching and practice to become really comfortable.</p> 
<p>6. Steep blacks and difficult off-piste cause bad habits to return.</p> 
<p></p> <br>
The Mountain Tamer 1. You have been snowboarding for years and 
are comfortable when asked to ride almost any terrain.<br>
<br>

<p>2. You can make adjustments in your snowboarding to allow for changing

shallow pitch to a steeper pitch.</p> 
<p>3. You have experience snowboarding trees, moguls, powder, choppy snow, ice 
and any other condition the mountain can throw up, even if you cannot always 
ride it with style.</p> 
<p>4. You feel like you can ride anything but would like to be able to refine 
your technique and improve your control.<br>
<br>
 5. You can carve at speed 
down steep blues and some blacks</p> 
<p>6. Riding switch is second nature to you.</p> <br>
