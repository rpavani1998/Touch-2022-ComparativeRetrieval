<h1>The mountain ski resort of Beldersay <br>
Skiing and snowboarding in 
Uzbekistan. Ski slopes, ski lifts and options for snowboarding and skiing in 
Uzbekistan</h1> 
<h2>Description of the slopes, lifts, and routes of Beldersay:</h2> The 
mountain resort of<strong>Beldersay</strong> is located 80 km to the South-East 
of Tashkent. It takes approximately 1-1.5 hours by car on the new highway to 
get there during which you are in stunning highlands with the<strong>mysterious
</strong> and <strong>picturesque</strong><strong>spurs of the Western Tian Shan
</strong> covered by archa, juniper and apple forests, bushes of dog-roses and 
barberry, and<strong>rapid rivers</strong> and <strong>waterfalls</strong>. 
<p> Thick snow cover lies on the region of Beldersay, on the slope of <strong>
Kumbel Mountain</strong> on which the route is located, and it doesn't melt from
<strong>December</strong> till April. Justifiably, Beldersay is considered to 
be a world class resort. Here, travelers can<strong>ski</strong> and <strong>
snowboard</strong> as well as sun-bathe, thanks to the fact that there are more 
than<strong>300 sunny days</strong> a year. </p>
<p> Until recently, a phenomenon of the Chimgan region had not been discovered 
- at a height of 1 meter off the thick snow cover the air temperature can reach 
+18OC!  The continental climate provides the extreme temperature and <strong>
abundant snowfalls</strong>. Due to sharp temperature variations between day 
and night, a firm surface is formed that adds better glide and provides first 
class exciting skiing. When the slope has been smoothed out, it is only 
necessary to wait until a new snowfall and then there is an opportunity to ski 
on fresh soft<strong>powder</strong>. </p>
<p> In Beldersay there are two coffee-bars open for visitors, and the one that 
is located next to the rope tow that allows you the opportunity to purchase 
fast food and drink hot home-made wine during the skiing.</p>
<p> The distance to the nearest skiing center <b>&quot;Chimgan&quot;</b> is 4 
km, and there you can go to a Disco club or go on a horse riding trip.</p>

<p><b>The ski routes of Beldersay</b> </p>
<p> The Beldersay route is officially registered in <strong>FIS</strong> 
(Federation of International Skiing). The entire length of the route is 3020 m. 
The route with the most extensive areas for skiing is considered a<strong>
&quot;black&quot;</strong> (difficult route) and is divided into 3 skiing zones 
that can be conditionally divided into the upper routes from<strong>Kumbel 
Mountain</strong> (being served by the rope tow), lower route (being served by 
the chair-lift) and the<strong>extreme skiing</strong> zone to the left and 
right sides of Kumbel Mountain.</p>
<p> Upper routes are not marked and are determined by the configuration of the 
peak itself. Basically, they are the<strong>&quot;black&quot;</strong> and 
<strong>&quot;red&quot;</strong> routes (6-7) but there are also 2-3 
&quot;blue&quot; routes for beginners. The length of the routes is from 500 to 
1200 m, though due to the huge size of the mountain there is a possibility for 
professionals oflonger traverses up to 2 - 3 km.</p>
<p> The lower route has a length of approx. 2,5 km. The entire route is 
&quot;red&quot;, except for one small &quot;black&quot; area where the 
&quot;aces&quot; of &quot;red&quot; routes can descent sideways.</p>
<p> The Extreme zone is the area on each sides of Kumbel Mountain. Depending 
on the snow conditions these areas are very often buried by avalanches. In the 
last 18 years, 5 people have died due to prohibited skiing in the avalanche 
zone. That's why it is necessary to consult with the representative of the
<strong>Rescue service</strong> regarding snow condition (an exception is the 
areas where caution signs or fence are installed).</p>
