<p> The 1932 and 1980 Winter Olympic Games have firmly established the 
Adirondacks, and specifically Lake Placid, as the premier winter sports capital 
of the world. In fact, when it comes to winter sports, there is more to see and 
do in the Adirondacks that anywhere else on earth!! Where else can a visitor 
ride to the top of a 120 meter ski jump or hurdle down a refrigerated bobsled 
track at 60 miles per hour! With hundreds of miles of beautiful backcountry ski 
trails, cross country skiers can pole their way from village to village 
stopping along the way to sample delicious homecooked meals at many trailside 
inns and bed and Breakfast's. For Alpine Skiers, the Adirondacks and Upstate 
New York boast over 30 ski mountains including Gore Mountain and Whiteface 
Mountain, offering the steepest vertical drop in the East. In Vermont skiiers 
can choose from over seventeen major ski resorts including Ascutney, Bear 
Creek, Bolton Valley, Bromley, Burke ,Jay Peak, Killington/Pico, Mad River 
Glen, Middlebury Snow Bowl, Mount Snow, Okemo, Smugglers' Notch, Stowe, 
Stratton, Sugarbush and Suicide six.<br>
