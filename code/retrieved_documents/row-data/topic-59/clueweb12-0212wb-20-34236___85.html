<p></p> DENVER, Colo. - February 15, 2012 - Every Colorado Ski Country USA 
(CSCUSA) resort received a good helping of fresh snow within the last seven 
days. The most recent snowstorm to move through Colorado was widespread, lasted 
several days, and left snow accumulations between 35 and eight inches. 
<p></p> 
<p>The storm ended Tuesday afternoon and nearly every resort posted 
double-digit snow totals for the week. Wolf Creek, in the southwest part of the 
state, boasted 35 inches for the most recent seven-day period, and Steamboat, 
in the northwest region of the state, enjoyed a robust 28.5 inches for the

Monarch celebrated 20.5 inches. A weekly total of 20 inches of new snow fell at 
both Copper Mountain and Purgatory at Durango Mountain Resort.</p> <br>
<br>

<p>Nearly that much came down at Arapahoe Basin as that resort reported a 
weekly snow accumulation of 19.25 inches and Crested Butte Mountain Resort 
reported an even 19 inches. Howelsen Hill saw 17 inches from the storm and 
Snowmass gained 16 inches.</p> <br>
<br>

<p>More than a foot of new snow covered Eldora and Sunlight during the 
week-long storm, with those resorts both reporting 14 inches. And exactly a 
foot of snow piled up at Aspen, Aspen Highlands, Powderhorn and SolVista Basin 
at Granby Ranch.</p> <br>
<br>

<p>The snow system brought Echo Mountain 11 inches of powder, Buttermilk nine 
inches and Ski Cooper eight inches. Skiers and riders are encouraged to safely 
enjoy the fresh powder and packed powder conditions, and be aware of changing 
mountain conditions.</p> 
<p>Resorts are welcoming guests during President's Day weekend and spring 
break with events and deals.</p>

resorts have 26 inches of new snow that has accumulated over the last few days.

President's Day holiday. Visitors will be able to enjoy ideal conditions across 
5,000 acres of open terrain, 35 lifts, 6 terrain parks and a jib pipe -

<p></p>  Double gold for Naude 
<p></p> 
<p><strong>Lemieux takes bronze in NorAm dual moguls</strong></p> <br>

<p><strong>PENTICTION, BRITISH COLUMBIA </strong>(February 14, 2012) - It was 
a sweetheart of a Valentine's Day for Penticton's Andi Naude as she earned her 
second straight NorAm gold in the dual moguls event today at Apex Mountain 
Resort.<br>
<br>
 Naude, 16, took won the singles yesterday with a score of 
24.90 in the ladies super final. Americans Ali Kariotis and Sophia Schwartz 
were second and third with scores of 23.93 and 19.76, respectively.<br>
<br>
 
Today Naude went up against Schwartz in the final. It was a close dual, as 
Schwartz beat the Canadian across the line. But in the end, Naude's turns and 
air scores gave her the edge. Kariotis was third.<br>
<br>
 Naude, who is with 
the BC Freestyle Academy program and calls Apex her home mountain, said, 
&quot;I probably had a bit of an advantage because I know this course so 
well.&quot; She added, &quot;I was excited to compete at home in front of my 
friends and family.&quot;<br>
<br>
 And her family's reaction to her success 
here? &quot;My mom was happy I made it down the course safe.&quot;<br>
<br>

the men's side, the US swept the podium in yesterday's single mogul 
competition. Troy Tully was first at 24.87, Nathan Roberts was second at 24.7 
and Nicholas Keating was third at 22.06.<br>
<br>
 Luke Ulsifer of Calgary was 
the top Canadian man in seventh position.<br>
<br>
 Ulsifer, who is a four-year 
member of the Alberta Freestyle Team, said &quot;I was really happy to make 
finals for the first time in a NorAm. This is one of my favorite courses and 
I'm pretty confident on it.&quot; Ulsifer also made finals today, finishing in 
15th.<br>
<br>
 In the rest of duals action, Americans Shane Cordeau and Reed 
Snyderman were first and second. In the small final Canadian National Team 
rookie Simon Lemieux battled his one-time idol American Nathan Roberts and the 
Repentigny, Que. native emerged the bronze medalist.<br>
<br>
 It was Lemieux's 
best NorAm finish this year. &quot;I couldn't ask for more, especially with my 
last dual against my hero from when I was young. Today I was fast and I did two 
good jumps against Roberts.&quot;<br>
<br>
 NorAm action continues next week 
with moguls events in Val St. Come, Quebec</p>

<p>Big Snow Year, Course Change for 4th annual north face vertical challenge 
competition at alyeska resort</p> 
<p>February 1, 2012 ( Girdwood , Alaska ) - In its fourth year, Alyeska 
Resort's North Face Vertical Challenge will feature a new course this winter. 
This friendly &quot;competition&quot; is scheduled for Friday, February 24, 
2012. An endurance race event at heart, the North Face Vertical Challenge 
offers all disciplines (alpine, telemark skiers, snowboarders) an opportunity 
to &quot;lap the tram&quot; and log as many vertical feet on Alyeska Resort's 
infamous North Face between the hours of 9:00 A.M. and 5:00 P.M. as physically 
possible.</p> <br>
<br>

<p>The 2012 North Face Vertical Challenge route takes a fresh approach with a 
new big-mountain course. Same as previous years, the entry gate at the top of 
the venue will be positioned just uphill of the Upper Tram Terminal portal. As 
the competitors head down the North Face, they will stay to the left and 
descend thru an area called Tram Pocket. Competitors will pass under the tram 
tower and race towards Small Dawgs near West Line. At this point, they will 
enter the North Star gate and continue through steep gladed terrain in the 
Northwest Passage area which the resort developed two winters ago. This path 
results in 2,000 vertical feet of off-piste terrain with a final exit near the 
groomed trails of the Refinery Terrain Park where with the aerial tram in 
sight, competitors will get a chance to regroup before charging another lap.</p>
<br> <br>

<p>&quot;With fantastic conditions this winter and a strong repeat class of 
competitors, it was time to raise the bar and update the course,&quot; said 
Brian Burnett, Mountain Services Manager and race founder. &quot;The strongest 
athletes will snap off about 40 runs during the eight hour challenge. That's 
over 80,000 vertical feet in a day.&quot;</p> 
<p>Competitors will ride the Alyeska Aerial tram starting at 9:00 A.M. and 
enter the specially designated event gate. They will be able to use the patrol 
line to reload the tram and accumulate laps until 5:00 P.M. Top finishers in 
the race in their respective categories will win a variety of winter-themed 
prizes as well as bragging rights. Registration for the race is open and 
available at the Tram Ticket Office at Alyeska Resort between 9:30 A.M. and 
open until 5:30 P.M. Sunday to Wednesday, and until 8:30 P.M. on Thursday to 
Saturday during night-skiing. The North Face Challenge is limited to the first 
50 registrants and competitor spots sell out annually. Proceeds from the North 
Face Vertical Challenge will benefit Alyeska Resort's Ski Patrol Avalanche Dog 
Program.</p> <br>
<br>

<p>Following the awards ceremony on Friday night at the Sitzmark, Pato Banton 
will take the stage at 10:00 P.M for a Reggae themed party. Pato Banton is 
scheduled to play Thursday to Saturday night, February 23-25, 2012. Tickets for 
the shows are $10 in advanced and $15 day of show, and can be purchased online, 
at any Alyeska Ticket Office and over the phone at 907-754-2275. All Sitzmark 
shows are 21 and over.</p>

ushers and groomsmen, all decked out in black ski jackets and red neckties. 
Mount Snow's Director of Marketing and Events, Matt Gebo, took it a step 
further by donning a tuxedo for the event.<br>
<br>
 &quot;Following the 
success of the inaugural Cloud Nine Nuptials we have already decided to make 
this an annual event,&quot; said Gebo. &quot;There were a lot of great moments 
today; from the couple that renewed their vows for their 44th wedding 
anniversary to the two couples that officially got married at the top of the 
mountain. Memories were made today and we look forward to helping create more 
memories next year on Valentine's Day.&quot;<br>

<p><strong>Champagne Powder&reg; Makes the Perfect Valentine's Day Present
</strong></p> 
<p>Mother Nature Drops Two Feet of Snow in a Week, 65 Inches Since The New Year
</p> 
<p>STEAMBOAT SPRINGS, CO-February 14, 2012-Mother Nature proved that she 
&quot;loves&quot; Steamboat, by giving the best Valentine's Day present: a 
powder day. Seven inches of new snow greeted powderhounds first thing this 
morning, with steady snow falling throughout the day, resulting in more than 
two feet covering Mt. Werner in the past 6 days.</p> 
<p>&quot;What better way to toast this holiday than by playing in the 
Champagne Powder snow with loved ones,&quot; said Chris Diamond, president 
&amp; chief operating officer for Steamboat Ski &amp; Resort Corporation. 
&quot;With two feet of snow in the past week, the conditions at Steamboat are 
the best of the season, and the forecast shows even more snow is on the 
way.&quot;</p> 
<p>Steamboat is currently in a storm cycle that, as of the 5 am report, 
yielded 7 inches at mid-mountain and 9 inches at the summit, 11 inches at mid 
and 13 inches at the summit in the past 48 hours, and 24.5 inches at mid and 
29.5 inches at the summit in the past six days. Snow continues to blanket Ski 
Town, U.S.A.&reg;.</p> 
<p>Since January 1st, Steamboat has seen 5.4 feet of snow pile up at 
mid-mountain and 6 feet at the summit. Forecasts are calling for additional 
snow through Thursday with 4-8 inches of accumulation possible. Another storm 
system moves into the area on Sunday with additional snowfall predicted.</p> 
<br> <br>
<br>
<br>

<p>The resort is reporting a 51-inch base at mid-mountain and 60-inch base at 
the summit on powder conditions. Currently 162 out of 165 trails covering 2,885 
acres, or 97% of terrain, including the resort's legendary tree skiing 
area-Shadows, Closets, Flying Z, Twilight, Triangle 3 and Pioneer Ridge.</p> 
<br> <br>
<br>
<br>

<p>The snow is piling up and so are the deals. Book the Champagne Powder 
Package by February 29th through Steamboat Central Reservations&reg; to save an 
additional 20% on lifts and lodging and get $100 in Boat Bucks. As an added 
bonus, receive a $100 American Express gift card for every airline ticket 
purchased into Steamboat/Hayden Airport as part of the Champagne Powder package 
through Steamboat Central Reservations. With the powder piling up, you have to 
act just as fast!</p> <br>
<br>

<p>Steamboat Central Reservations, which represents the majority of the 
lodging properties in the area, offers a variety of winter vacation packages 
and air specials as well as its exclusive online iCORIS technology, allowing 
guests to book their entire vacation online. Call toll-free (800) 922-2722 or 
visit steamboat.com</p> 
<p>While the new snow is welcome by everyone, the resort reminds skiers and 
riders to be aware of changing mountain conditions. The avalanche danger as 
rated by the Colorado Avalanche Information Center in the Steamboat zone is 
CONSIDERABLE. Areas beyond the ski area boundary are not patrolled or 
maintained.</p> 
<p>&quot;Valentine's Day is a great reminder that skiing and riding is that 
much more fun with someone you love,&quot; said John Kohnke, patrol director. 
&quot;Even on a powder day, there's always room for friends, especially if 
you're skiing and riding in deep snow conditions, near trees, in the 
side-country or in avalanche prone areas.&quot;</p> <strong>Beidahu Snow Jam 
Wrap-Up</strong> 
<p></p> 
<p>This Saturday saw the Nike Snow Jam series head to Beidahu for the second 
stop of the tour. Featuring an identical rail setup throughout the tour, the 
local Beidahu riders were out in force to impress the judges on their home 
turf. As Skullcandy cranked the tunes and hot chocolate and giveaways kept the 
crowd warm, it was definitely a fun atmosphere despite the below-freezing 
conditions!</p> <br>
<br>

<p>Once again it would be a Russian at the top of the podium as Stepan stomped 
a number of technical tricks on each jib option! Local boys Yan Ziqi (2nd) and 
Xiao Yuan (3rd) also deservedly moved through, shredding hard all session on 
each feature. Now the series heads to Shenyang in order to gather the final 
three riders that will compete in the Nike Snow Jam Finals on February 25th in 
Beijing's Chaoyang Park.</p> 
<p></p> <strong>Seven Glaciers prepares a wine dinner feast as special guest 
Charlie Wagner of Mer Soleil Winery makes appearance at upcoming wine dinner on 
February 26, 2012</strong> 
<p></p> 
<p>February 1, 2012 (Girdwood, Alaska) - Wine dinners in the winter ski season 
seemingly make for the perfect pairing. Alyeska Resort's award-winning 
mountain-top restaurant, Seven Glaciers, has embarked on its third season of 
winter wine dinners. The first of the series, held on Sunday, January 29, 
featured Merryvale Winery from Napa Valley, California. The menu featured a 
five -course evening from the kitchen of Seven Glaciers' executive chef Jason 
Porter and finished with a delectable dessert from the resort's executive 
pastry chef and chocolatier, Judy Carpetina.</p> <br>
<br>

<p>For the month of February, the featured vineyards and wineries includes a 
meritage of wines from the Wagner family of Napa Valley, California. The Wagner 
wine family includes world-acclaimed Caymus, Conundrum, Mer Soleil, and Belle 
Glos. Each winery represents a unique talent and passion amongst members of the 
Wagner family. The Wagner Wine Dinner is scheduled for Sunday, February 26 and 
reservations are highly recommended.</p> <br>
<br>

<p>For five generations, the Wagner family has lived in Napa Valley originally 
settling in the area in the 1800s. Caymus Vineyards was established when a 
mother and father and their son embarked on a family winery in 1972. Charlie, 
Lorna and their son, Chuck, began work in 1971 by planning the construction of 
a barn-like structure for the winery while they continued farming the already 
planted vineyards.</p> <br>
<br>

<p>Beginning in November of 1971, Charlie and Chuck along with one other 
worker pruned their 55 acres of grapes. With this initial effort began a bonded 
relationship, which would endure until Charlie's death in 2002. Charlie died in 
his 90th year of his hard working yet illustrious career. Charlie Wagner 
believed in moderation - yet had consumed about 3,000 gallonss of wine in his 
life.</p> <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<p>Son Chuck Wagner is the winemaker and viticulturist for Caymus. Decisions 
are made lot-by-lot about maceration times, fermentation temperatures, the type 
and toast level of French oak barrels, and the length of barrel aging. Selected 
lots are blended to make wines Chuck Wagner believes best express the vineyards 
and vintage. As Chuck Wagner says, &quot;Growing grapes and winemaking takes a 
tenacious will and endless spirit to be successful. I am proud that our family 
continues this way of life.&quot;</p> <br>
<br>

<p>Charlie has passed his passion and knowledge onto his three children, 
Charlie (the second), Joseph and new winemaking apprentice Jenny. The family 
tradition continues with Charlie making exquisite Chardonnay at Mer Soleil in 
the Santa Lucia Highlands of Monterey County and Joseph making fine Pinot Noir 
under the Belle Glos label in the coastal areas of California. Jenny has been 
learning the ropes at Caymus. Jon Bolta, a longtime (yet unrelated) family 
friend continues as winemaker for Conundrum, perfecting his craft of making 
that puzzling, white wine blend.</p> <br>
<br>

<p>Charlie Wagner will be joining the staff of Seven Glaciers and guests of 
the Wagner wine dinner for an evening of family-style story telling. The Wagner 
Wine Dinner will start at 7:00 P.M. Seatings for the dinner are $165 per 
person. Reservations for the dinner can be made by calling 907-754-2237 or 
online. Guests must be age 21 or older to participate in this event.</p>

 GATORADE FREE FLOW TOUR CROWNS 2012 CHAMPIONS 
<p></p> 
<p><strong>Finals Culminate at Snowbasin Resort with Five New Champions
</strong></p> 
<p><strong>Burr Ridge, Ill. - February 12, 2012 - </strong>With massive crowds 
cheering them on, the contestants at the Gatorade Free Flow Tour Finals took to 
the professional Winter Dew Tour courses in prospect of being crowned the 2012 
Champion. Topping a competitive field of the nation's best snowboard and 
freeski amateurs, the slopestyle Finals saw Andy Partridge in ski and Brooke 
Voigte and Kent Callister in snowboard take the top spot, earning a 
prequalified spot in the 2012-13 Winter Dew Tour. Sunday saw down-to-the-wire 
superpipe contests as the snow began to fall on Utah. Callister doubled his 
win, topping the podium for the second day in a row, along with Kelly Berger in 
snowboard and Broby Leeds in freeski.</p> 
<p>Friday afternoon, the freeskiers cleared the professionals from the slope 
course at Snowbasin as they went head to head and run for run for first place. 
Earning the win with an impressive run was Park City local Partridge. The 
youngest skier of the day was spot on with his 270 on the down-rail, frontside 
switch-up to backside 270 on the up-down rail, and 270 off the cannon rail, 
followed by a clean right 900 and big switch 1080.</p> 
<p>&quot;The course was really good,&quot; said Partridge, only fifteen 
years-old. &quot;I'm stoked itw as on the Dew Tour course. It was a lot of fun. 
Competing on the Dew Tour is something I've been wanting to do for a while, and 
I'm really stoked that I get to do it now.&quot;</p> 
<p>Saturday the snowboarders took to the rails and immaculate jumps, where 
Voigte and Callister proved they were ready to make the step up from amateur 
status. With a 50-50, 50-50 frontside boardslide, tailgrab off the cannon rail, 
frontside 360, backside 180, Voigte earned her spot in next year's Winter Dew 
Tour. Closing out the day, the Callister kicked off a weekend of success with 
his frontside lipslide on the first rail, boardslide to fakie on the 2nd rail, 
cab boardslide 270 out off the cannonbox, cab 900, frontside 1080.</p> 
<p>As the snow finally started to fall on the slopes of Snowbasin, the 
snowboarders and freeskiers took their best tricks to the pipe. The women went 
first, where Berger made her first trip to the Finals worthwhile. Her front 
five, back five, clean straight airs and front seven to cab three earned the 
highest marks of the contest. Said Berger of her success, &quot;It's really 
exciting! The Gatorade Free Flow Tour was one of the main things I was focusing 
on this year, so I'm stoked.&quot; Followed by the men's snowboard division, 
the contest came down to everyone's second runs as they proved their abilities 
were made to Flow to Pro. Callister, after taking the slopestyle win less than 
24 hours earlier, smashed the competition with a score that lead the next 
contestant by four points. His straight air and front ten were a clean start to 
his cab seven, front nine, back nine and five. The first Gatorade Free Flow 
Tour athlete to ever Champion in two disciplines, Callister could hardly 
express his excitement, saying &quot;It's pretty awesome, I'm really excited 
about it. I didn't expect it!&quot;</p> 
<p>The freeskiers took to the 614-foot long pipe last, proving to the 
supportive crowd that the show was not over. Leeds, a three-time Finalist, 
earned the victory with his nine hundred to alley-oop nine hundred, 720 tail to 
switch alley-oop 720, 540, right 540, and finished with a boosty 1080. 
Competing on the largest pipe in the world was no problem for the 18-year-old - 
&quot;I added a couple hits, didn't have to add in anything new but worked on 
performing them better.&quot; With a pre-qualified spot in next season's Winter 
Dew Tour, Leeds said after his five-plus point win over second place, &quot;I'm 
very excited! I have a lot to learn I think, but it should be lots of fun.&quot;
</p> 
<p>With their wins at the Gatorade Free Flow Tour Finals, Partridge, Voigte 
Callister, Berger and Leeds will make their professional contest debut at the 
2012-13 Winter Dew Tour, where they will compete against the biggest names in 
their sport.</p>

<p>Cloud Nine Nuptials At Mount Snow Attracts More Than 20 Couples; Some Who 
Will Tie The Knot For The First Time, Others Will Renew Their Vows At 3,600 Feet
<br> <br>
 West Dover, VT (February 13, 2012) - The inaugural Cloud Nine 
Nuptials at Mount Snow Resort in Southern Vermont has more than 20 couples 
signed up, three of which will tie-the-knot for the first time with the others 
renewing their marriage vows at the top of the mountain on Valentine's Day, 
including last year's Mount Snow Wedding Giveaway winners Dave Rothman and Tyne 
Pike-Sprenger who are coming back to the resort to celebrate their one year 
anniversary. The occasion will start at 10:00am with the 'processional' going 
up the Sunbrook Quad, complete with wedding music, and couples will unload at 
the top to gather around a heart painted on the snow where a local Justice of 
the Peace will conduct the ceremony.<br>
<br>
 Mount Snow has always been a 
popular couples destination with stories of people meeting at the mountain, and 
eventually getting married, dating back to the resort's early days of the 
1950's.<br>
<br>
 &quot;There's just something about this place that sparks 
romance&quot;, said communications manager, David Meeker, who met his wife 
while working at Mount Snow back in 2004. &quot;Some of the folks joining us 
for the Cloud Nine Nuptials met here and even got married here, so Mount Snow 
holds a special place in many hearts.&quot;<br>
<br>
 Mount Snow also offered 
two lift tickets for $49 available for advance purchase online prior to Monday, 
February 13. There is also a three course Sweetheart Tasting Menu dinner being 
offered at Harriman's Restaurant in the Grand Summit Resort Hotel from 6:00pm

Famous Shovel Race Championships Return to the Slopes at Angel Fire Resort<br>
 
New Mexico Wild Winter Competition Set For February 11-12<br>
 ANGEL FIRE, 
N.M.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Competitors of all ages are once again waxing their snow 
shovels for the legendary Angel Fire Shovel Race Championship happening 
February 11 - 12, 2012. The challenge is fairly simple. Competitors sit on the 
scoop of a standard aluminum snow shovel, handle pointed downhill, and then 
lift their hands and feet to allow gravity to take them for a ride. Each rider 
gets two shots to clock the fastest time down the front of the Angel Fire ski 
mountain. Top speeds regularly exceed 60 miles per hour.<br>
</p> 
<p>&quot;It has since grown into a wacky, full-bore competition with speed 
suits, radar guns, costumes and family racing legacies. Just about every idea 
to blow it out of proportion in the name of good winter fun has been 
exploited.&quot;<br>
 &quot;Shovel racing began as a simple contest here in the 
1970's when our lift operators would ride their shovels down the mountain at 
the end of their shifts,&quot; explains Dave Dekema, director of marketing, 
Angel Fire Resort. &quot;It has since grown into a wacky, full-bore competition 
with speed suits, radar guns, costumes and family racing legacies. Just about 
every idea to blow it out of proportion in the name of good winter fun has been

<p><strong>Turski's Dew Tour win wraps up a five-medal weekend for Canada
</strong></p> 
<p><strong>OGDEN, UTAH (February 12, 2012)</strong> - The 2012 Dew Tour 
wrapped up in Snowbasin today and Canadian Kaya Turski came away with a gold 
medal, the Dew Cup and the award for athlete of the year, which she shared with 
American Devin Logan.<br>
<br>
 Turski, who won the X Games two weeks ago and 
was also crowned X Games female athlete of the year, has had a perfect season 
so far, winning every slopestyle event she's entered.<br>
<br>
 The 
Montreal-native had today's event sewn up on the first run where she scored a 
93.75. Anna Segal of Australia was second at 90.75 and Logan took the bronze 
medal at 89.00.<br>
<br>
 The slopestyle course in Snowbasin was fairly 
technical, with three rail features and two jumps. It's the kind of course 
Turski loves. &quot;The course really worked in my favor because I'm strong on 
the rails and I worked hard to get my rail game on point here.&quot;<br>
<br>
 
Turski, who didn't have a slopestyle coach before this season, credits hard 
work and the resources that have become available to her since the Olympic 
announcement, from the Canadian Freestyle Ski Association and its partners as 
well and her main personal sponsor, Red Bull, with her results to date this 
season.<br>
<br>
 &quot;I feel like all my hard work's been paying off -- in 
the gym and the summer and with my coaches and sponsor. It's exciting to have 
it all pay off. And I work well with [my coaches] Toben [Sutherland] and JF 
[Cusson]. It definitely feels good to have people at the start gate cheering 
for you and people to consult on your run. Before I only had my friends, and 
they were my competitors, so it wasn't quite the same.&quot;<br>
<br>
 
Huntsville, Ontario's Dara Howell, the newest member of the Canadian National 
Slopestyle Team, was sixth in the semi-finals, just missing a berth into 
today's finals.<br>
<br>
 Turski also finished on top of the Dew Cup standings 
with 200 points.<br>
<br>
 On the men's side, four Canadians advanced to 
finals, but none reached the podium. The US swept the top spots with Nick 
Goepper in first at 95.00, Tom Wallisch in second at 92.25 and Bobby Brown 
third at 91.00.<br>
<br>
 The top Canadian was St. Boniface, Que.'s Alex 
Bellemare in sixth at 88.00. Next was Alex Beaulieu-Marchand of Quebec City in 
10th at 70.00. Jamieson Irvine of Barrie, Ont. was 11th at 69.00 and 
Drummondville, Que.'s JF Houle was 12th after falling on both his runs, at 
13.00.<br>
<br>
 Canadian men who did not advance to finals included: Vincent 
Gagnier of Victoriaville, Que. in 17th; Philip Casabon of Grand-M&egrave;re, 
Que. in 19th; Charles Gagnier of Victoriaville, Que. in 22nd; and, Alexi 
Godbout of Mont Tremblant, Que. in 24th.<br>
<br>
 Turski's medal wraps up a 
five-medal weekend for the Canadian Freestyle Team, including one in aerials, 
one in halfpipe, three in moguls and one in ski slopestyle.<br>
<br>
 The 
National Slopestyle and Halfpipe Teams next compete at the Mammoth Mountain 
World Cup on March 2 and 3.<br>
<br>
 Freestyle action continues this week with 
back-to-back mogul NorAm competitions at Apex Mountain Resort tomorrow and 
Tuesday; an FIS World Cup Aerials event in Kreischberg, Austria on February 17 
and a World Cup mogul competition in Naeba, Japan on February 18.<br>

<p></p> <strong>Kostelic victory with consequences</strong> 
<p></p> 
<p>World Cup win despite injury?<br>
<br>
 Ivica Kostelic (CRO) is the big 
winner of today's Super Combined in the Olympic dress rehearsal in Sochi (RUS). 
His impressive victory ahead of Beat Feuz (SUI) also earned Kostelic the title 
in the Combined World Cup. Having clinched victory three times in four races 
the Croatian has now made things clear in this particular World Cup ranking. 
Kostelic has also increased his lead in the overall World Cup at the same time. 
Today's race, however, also had a negative consequence for the best skier in 
the world at the current time: Kostelic may have injured a knee joint.</p> 
<p>Initial diagnosis: meniscus injury </p> 
<p>It is assumed that there is a problem with his meniscus (which had already 
been giving him trouble) which flared up during Kostelic's outstanding Slalom 
run. The Slalom expert acted as if nothing had happened during the run with his 
textbook turns on what was a very difficult piste. Despite going into a clear 
lead he appeared to be disturbed by something. This was hardly surprising as 
the winner of the Combined World Cup had to limp out of the finish area and was 
treated immediately in the medical tent. &quot;I know this pain, I've often had 
it and most of the time it was the meniscus. But we won't be able to say 
anything of course until I've had it checked out in hospital,&quot; said 
Kostelic, forced to swallow a bitter pill despite the day being so successful.
</p> 
<p>Downhill the foundation stone, Slalom the icing on the cake</p> 
<p>Ivica Kostelic had already put in a strong performance in the Super 
Combined Downhill run, paving the way for the Slalom with a good 15th place, 
only 1.52 seconds behind the leader. Kostelic then left his opponents no chance 
in &quot;his&quot; discipline. Even technical specialist Benni Raich (AUT) was 
trailing 0.66 seconds behind today's winner. An icy slope, a technically 
demanding run and interesting terrain do of course favour Slalom experts such 
as Kostelic, but: &quot;The Downhill is also extremely fast, with lots of bumps 
and it really takes it out of you. The speed specialists certainly have bigger 
advantages here. So all in all the chances were balanced,&quot; says Kostelic, 
who once again showed that he is capable of seizing an opportunity.</p> 
<p></p>  DAVID WISE WINS FREESKI SUPERPIPE, KEVIN ROLLAND TAKES SECOND 
CONSECUTIVE DEW CUP AT TOYOTA CHAMPIONSHIP 
<p></p> 
<p><strong><em>Devin Logan Wins First Women's Dew Cup</em></strong></p> 
<p><strong>Snowbasin, Utah - Feb. 11, 2012 -</strong> The men's freeski 
superpipe final at the Toyota Championship saw one of the closest Dew Cup races 
in Winter Dew Tour history culminate today in Snowbasin. Going into the 
competition, Kevin Rolland was leading the standings, with Torin Yater-Wallace 
just two points behind him. Neither was able to get past David Wise tonight, 
after he landed a solid first run, scoring a 94.50 that could not be topped by 
anyone's second attempt through the pipe. He started his run with a switch 
double cork 1080, followed by a rightside 900, a leftside 900, an alley oop 540 
tailgrab, and a double cork 1260. &quot;I'm on a hot streak for sure,&quot; 
said Wise after his first Dew Tour win. &quot;It's fun to be out here enjoying 
the sport. Just being able to land runs and enjoy doing what I do has been 
awesome. And that's honestly what's made the difference for me.&quot;</p> 
<p>Rolland edged out Yater-Wallace by a quarter of a point to land in second 
place to earn the 2012 Freeski Superpipe Dew Cup. &quot;This feels really great 
especially because I didn't win at the last Dew Tour stop,&quot; said Rolland, 
after being awarded the Cup. &quot;So there was a little bit of trouble in my 
mind. I tried to do my best and get the Dew Cup.&quot;</p> 
<p>Women's freeski superpipe finals awarded the first women's freeski Dew Cup 
to Devin Logan, after her aggressive run blew away the competition with a score 
of 90.00. Already holding the lead, she dropped into the pipe, starting her run 
with a japan grab to a 540 tail grab, followed by a flare, mute grab, alley-oop 
critical grab, 720 mute, ending with a switch alley-oop 540. Logan was able to 
land seven tricks due to the superpipe 615-foot length, the longest ever built 
for a contest. &quot;I'm so excited,&quot; exclaimed Logan following her win. 
&quot;I can't describe my feelings right now. It's hit, but not really. I'm 
just in amazement right now. I'm so happy with everyone skiing and myself.&quot;
</p> 
<p>You can catch all of the final runs from today's top finishers here. 
Tomorrow's men's ski slopestyle finals will air live on NBC at 1:00pm MST.</p>

<p></p>  Ollywood hangs on to yellow bib with third place finish 
<p></p> <br>

<p><strong>BEIDA LAKE, CHINA (February 11, 2012)</strong> - Canada's Olivier 
Rochon battled freezing temperatures and high winds en route to a bronze medal 
in the FIS Freestyle aerial event here today.<br>
<br>
 The weather caused some 
serious consternation amongst athletes and coaches who were worried about 
safety. Eventually, organizers altered the regular format to a one-jump event, 
which meant that each athlete had only one chance and about three-and-a-half 
seconds in the air to make the podium.<br>
<br>
 Guangpu Qi of China used his 
airtime well and placed first with a considerable score of 131.67; his 
countryman Zongyang Zia took the silver at 127.66 and Rochon was third with a 
score of 123.45.<br>
<br>
 Rochon explained that most of the aerialists had 
planned to downgrade their jumps, but not him. &quot;Because of the wind I only 
got a couple of training jumps in, but I was confident about them so I decided 
to go for my hardest trick, [a quadruple twisting, triple backflip]. When the 
Chinese guys who jumped after me saw that I landed well, they decided to do 
harder tricks too &#133; I don't mind, I'm happy for them, but I am glad that I 
blocked a Chinese sweep.&quot;<br>
<br>
 Rochon said he is confident in 
challenging weather conditions because he has good skiing skills, which help 
him land consistently. &quot;And,&quot; he added, &quot;My first coach, 
[Nicolas Fontaine], &quot;made us jump in every kind of weather, so I'm ready 
for anything.&quot;<br>
<br>
 The bronze medal means Rochon, who has been on 
the podium four times already this season, keeps a grip on the yellow leader's 
bib by a margin of 50 points over Jia. When asked if he's feeling pressure to 
keep amassing results, Rochon replied, &quot;I try not too look at the big 
picture, when I do that I get ahead of myself and I learned the hard way that 
when I get ahead of myself I go down. So, I'm working really hard to stay in 
the moment and look at everything jump by jump.&quot;<br>
<br>
 Montreal's 
Jean-Christophe Andr&eacute; was the only other Canadian in today's 
competition. He finished 14th after slapping back on his landing.<br>
<br>
 
&quot;I'm a bit disappointed. I got a little excited on my takeoff today so I 
leaned back too much. The conditions were hard, but this was my mistake and I'm 
looking forward to making up for it later in the month,&quot; said Andr&eacute;.
<br> <br>
 On the women's side, China swept the podium with Xin Zhang in top 
spot at 101.16; Mengtao Xu second at 95.70 and Shuang Cheng third with a score 
of 89.30.<br>
<br>
 There were no Canadian women represented at the event today.
<br> <br>
 World Cup action continues here tomorrow with a mogul event. The 
Canadian Halfpipe and Slopestyle teams compete in the Dew Tour finals in Ogden, 
UT tomorrow and Sunday.<br>
<br>
<br>
<strong>Labb&eacute;-Gigu&egrave;re 
represents Canada at UOP aerial NorAms, finishes seventh</strong><br>
<br>
 At 
the Utah Olympic Park in the third of three aerial NorAm events today, Canada's 
lone entry, Marc-Antoine Labb&eacute;-Gigu&egrave;re, was seventh. Americans 
swept the men's and women's podiums as Michael Rossi, Mac Bohonnon and Jack 
Boyczuk took the men's division; while Madison Olsen, Madison Gorelik and Sara 
Swenson went one, two, three on the women's side.<br>
<br>
 
Labb&eacute;-Gigu&egrave;re was happy with his performance over the three 
events, where he finished seventh, tenth and seventh.<br>
<br>
 &quot;I have 
some work to do on my jumps, especially my full-full, for sure,&quot; said the 
20-year-old who resides in Quebec City, &quot;but I didn't get to jump much 
this winter so far because I broke my ankle in November, now that I'm on snow 
my jumps are getting better and better the more I train.&quot;<br>
<br>
 
Canada's only other NorAm-level aerialist, Quebec Team's Dave Blais, sat out 
today's event with concussion symptoms.</p>

<p></p>  Naude and Lalonde win NorAm medals 
<p></p> 
<p><strong>Telluride mogul NorAm</strong><br>
<strong>TELLURIDE, COLORADO 
(February 8, 2012)</strong> - Sixteen-year-old Canadians Andi Naude and Alexis 
Lalonde enjoyed their best NorAm finishes here today in a single mogul event, 
taking silver and bronze, in their respective categories. For both of the 
teenagers it was only their second appearance at this level of event.<br>
<br>
 
Naude, who comes from Penticton B.C. and skis with the BC Freestyle team earned 
a score of 23.38 and the fastest time in the women's division. She was second 
to Ali Kariotis of the US, who scored 23.79. Sophia Schwartz also of the US was 
third at 23.03.<br>
<br>
 &quot;I had some troubles skiing out of my top air [a 
360] today, but I managed to get back into my line so I'm happy with my 
performance. Tomorrow I'm just going to go our and have fun, skiing is what I 
like to do best,&quot; said Naude, who added that the course today was 
&quot;pretty easy - quite flat and not too technical.&quot;<br>
<br>
 The next 
Canadian woman was Christel Hamel of St. Sauveur, Que. who had her best NorAm 
finish, just outside the super final in 5th.<br>
<br>
 Alex-Anne Gagnon of the 
Quebec Team was 21st; Katrine Bazinet was 25th; Clare Lambert of Alberta was 32
nd; Kate Targett was 35th;<br>
<br>
 On the men's side, Lalonde, who hails from 
Chateauguay, Que. and who skis with the Quebec Performance Team said his goal 
for the day was to finish in the top 16, &quot;So, I'm really happy with the 
bronze medal.&quot;<br>
<br>
 Americans took gold and silver. Reilly Ryan 
scored 26.12 and Dylan Walczyk was 25.19. Lalonde scored 24.99.<br>
<br>
 
Lalonde explained that while he had an excellent run in the finals, he got a 
little out of control in the middle section of the super final, but managed to 
pull it together in time to do his signature jump, a 'cork 720 truck driver'. 
&quot;It's a style jump,&quot; he said, &quot;It's smooth and the judges like 
it and gave me high scores.&quot;<br>
<br>
 Canadian Team Coach Adrian Taggart 
was disappointed with the showing of the National Team athletes. The top 
National Team athlete, Simon Lemieux of Repentigny fell on his finals run and 
landed in 15th position. &quot;We had excellent training and I really expected 
better finishes today,&quot; he said. &quot;But, one of the difficulties with 
an easy course is that it's hard for the better athletes to differentiate 
themselves,&quot; said Taggart.<br>
<br>
 Quebec Team members Laurent Dumais 
and Kerrian Chunland were 11th and 12th 23.28 and 23.12, respectively.<br>
<br>

 National Team member P-O Gagne of Montreal was 17th; David Cooksley was 27th; 
National Team member Hugo Blanchette of Quebec City was 28th; Luke Ulsifer was 
29th; Troy Minogue was 30th; Zach Hoffman was 31st; Dean Bercovitch was 34th; 
Heath Berkovitch was 35th, Connor Spence was 37th; Julien Dufresne was 47th; 
and, Matt Joosten was 53rd.<br>

<br>
 Labbe-Giguere, who was injured 
earlier in the season, said, &quot;I'm not really happy with my performance, I 
haven't had a lot of training but I hoped to do better today.&quot;<br>
<br>
 
The only other Canadian in the field was Quebec Team member David Blais, who 
was 9th at 137.00<br>
<br>
 In the women's field Americans Kyley McKinnon and 
Madison Olsen took the gold and silver at 132.16 and 126.29, respectively. 
Renee McElduff of Australia was third at 125.77.<br>

SES Carving in Aspen with Red Oak</strong> 
<p></p> 
<p>Once again the Alpine Carving community converges on Aspen Colorado. Alpine 
snowboarders from around the world at making turns at one of the three resort

uses hard boots, much like ski boots, and snowboards that generally have most 
advanced technology in the ski and snowboarding industry. Carving is best seen 
in the Olympics as Parallel S / GS. Carving is thrilling and for many in the 
sport, addictive. It is not uncommon to find a Carver making S / GS turns 
dragging a hip during a graceful turn, laying down trenched in the snow, and a 
grin that reach ear to ear!</p> <br>

<strong>Spencer Link Wins the $20,000 Cholula Triple Air At 
Mountain High</strong><br>
<br>

<p></p> 
<p>Wrightwood, CA - February 7, 2012: The $20,000 Cholula Triple Air Show 
returned to Mountain High on Saturday, February 4, 2012, offering the largest 
prize purse in Southern California. Now in its fourteenth year, the event 
continues to gain strength with many raving this year's course was the best 
it's ever been.</p> 
<p>A perfect day on the mountain with sunny skies and warm temperatures 
provided riders with an amazing opportunity to let it all hang out. In the 
men's snowboard division, riders such as Yale Cousino, Scotty Vine, Trevor 
Jacob, Ian Thorley and Garrettt Warnick came out to compete but in the end, it 
was local hero and Mountain High team rider, Spencer Link who stole the show 
and the $5000 top prize with his ridiculously solid run that included a Cab 9, 
Front 7 and a nasty Back 10 Double.</p> 
<p>The women's snowboard division was stacked with riders like Lynn Neil, 
Mariah Dugan, Nirvana Ortanez, Jamie Madrid and Melissa Evans competing. On 
this day, it was Katie Williams out of Salt Lake City, Utah who stole the show 
and the $2000 top prize with her smooth run that included a clean front 5 on 
the money booter.</p> <br>
<br>

<p>In the ski division, some heavy hitters came out to compete including 
Patrick Goodhough, Max Peters, Noah Morrison and Time Gage. For the skiers it 
was all about the double corks with McRae Williams landing the smoothest run, 
dirtiest double and snagging the $3500 top prize.</p> 
<p>This year, The Cholula Triple Air Show was upgraded to a 3 star TTR (Ticket 
To Ride) event which means competitors earned points toward their overall 
worldwide ranking. The TTR standard is what competitive snowboarders use to 
rank themselves against each other, and earn entry into events like the Grand 
Prix and the Olympics.</p> <br>
<br>

<p>Special thanks goes out to the event's sponsors, Cholula Hot Sauce, 
Jarritos, Continuous, and more. And to Chuck Allen, the Godfather of 
snowboarding and co-founder of the USASA, without whom this event would not 
exist. For more information or to schedule an interview, please contact John 
McColly at 760 316 7803</p> <br>

<p></p> <strong>SEPPE SMITS CLAIMS THE 2012 TTR BIG AIR WORLD TOUR TITLE - 
PEETU PIIROINEN WINS THE BILLABONG AIR&amp;STYLE</strong> 
<p></p> 
<p><strong>Innsbruck, Austria - February 4th 2012</strong> - Peetu Piiroinen 
(FIN) wins the 6Star Billabong Air&amp;Style with steady Backside 1260 mute 
grabs all evening long. Seppe Smits (BEL) takes the TTR Big Air Tour Trophy 
2012 home, after coming in second here at the Bergisel Stadium in Innsbruck, 
closely followed by Niklas Mattsson (SWE).</p> 
<p>'Winning the Big Air Tour Trophy was unexpected, I was very happily 
surprised.' commented Seppe Smits. Congratulations came immediately from 3 time 
TTR Tour winner Peetu, who won tonight with a clean and stylish Backside 1260 
mute grab. Peetu is back after wrestling with injury, but is again landing all 
his tricks with his exceptional ease. He responded: 'It was a great night, and 
it felt really good being here. This was definitely one of the hardest 
competitions for me, with everyone stomping it.'</p> 
<p>Under icy conditions 12.500 spectators set fire to the Bergisel stadium for 
one of the most thrilling Air&amp;Style competitions ever. A gripping final was 
the perfect conclusion of an action packed night. With final scores not more 
than 0.6 points apart, it was clear the riders gave it their all. Peetu 
Piiroinen took home the ring of glory and another 1000 points for the World 
Tour Rankings. More surprising action was put down by Swedish Niklas Mattsson, 
who rounded up the podium after holding his own against 3 clear favorite 
opponents in the final, including former Air&amp;Style winner Sebastien Toutant 
(CAN). Niklas got the crowd to go wild with his second run, a Frontside 1080 
Double Cork Mute Grab.</p> <br>

<p>Eric Willett (USA) earned the second highest score of the night with a 
Switch Backside 1260 Double Cork Mute Grab, worth 94.0 points, but failed to 
make the Superfinal after encountering Peetu Piiroinen in the second round. He 
had the biggest chance of winning the TTR World Tour Big Air title, but missing 
the Superfinal tonight, meant he had to watch Seppe claim the championship. 
Tonight's performances had a major influence on the TTR Overall Tour Ranking, 
with Seb Toutant now leading the pack, and Stale Sandbech (NOR), Roope Tonteri 
(FIN), Seppe Smits and Eric Willett all move up, rounding up the top 5.</p> 
<p>The TTR World Tour will move to Oslo, Norway from 10-19 February, crowning 
male and female Halfpipe and Slopestyle World Champions at the first World 
Snowboarding Championships for snowboarders by snowboarders since 1999.</p> <br>
<p></p> <strong>Southern New Hampshire ski resort gets first High Speed Quad 
Lift</strong> 
<p></p> 
<p>Peak Resorts announces the acquisition of the high speed detachable quad 
chairlift formally of Ascutney Mountain, VT. The installation of the lift, 
along with a terrain expansion is planned at Crotched Mountain, NH for the 
2012-2013 season. This 3 million dollar capital investment will happen on the 
10 year anniversary of the reconstruction of the resort.</p> 
<p>We are very excited about the prospect of adding a detachable lift at 
CrotchedMountain. This lift will provide quick access to the summit, ultimately 
providing more value and vertical to our guests. Along with the lift, the 
addition of 25 acres of skiable terrain will be a significant upgrade for the 
resort.&quot; said Jesse Boyd, VP of Operations for Peak Resorts.</p> 
<p>While replacing the current Summit fixed grip lift, the only high speed 
quad lift in Southern NH will provide an uphill capacity of 2400 persons per 
hour, and access to an additional 25 acres of terrain in less than 4 minutes of 
time on the lift. The additional terrain access is accomplished by the 
extension of the current summit lift profile to the top of the mountain, 
approaching 1000 feet of vertical drop. The additional 25 acres of terrain will 
encompass three extra slopes and two glade areas. The new terrain will have 100 
percent fan snowmaking coverage as well as being lit for night skiing.</p> 
<p>&quot;We at Crotched pride our self on the commitment of service to all 
skiing and snowboarding guests from beginners all the way to expert terrain 
park and racing enthusiasts. The ability for us to provide the value of even 
more time on the slopes is very exciting. The expansion of terrain will benefit 
all of our clientele with an easier route off the top of the mountain and 
trails that will access our progressive terrain parks, glade skiing and allow 
us to stay committed to the ski racing culture of New Hampshire.&quot; said Pat 
Terry, General Manager of Crotched Mountain.</p> 
<p>Lift construction and trail development are scheduled to take place 
starting the spring of 2012 pending approval of permitting with NH State and 
local township regulations.</p> <br>
