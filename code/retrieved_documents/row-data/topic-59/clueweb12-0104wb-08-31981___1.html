<h2>Skiing, Snowboarding &amp; Tubing in Connecticut</h2> 
<p> <strong>CONNECTICUT OFFERS IDEAL WINTER SKI GETAWAYS</strong></p> 
<p> Connecticut&rsquo;s ideal location in southern New England makes it a 
great weekend or one-day winter ski trip destination, especially for families 
and beginners learning to ski. Indeed, Connecticut takes its snow seriously and 
lets no winter weather go to waste; a little known fact, snow making was 
actually invented in Connecticut at Mohawk!&nbsp;</p> 
<p> Within Connecticut, winter warriors can find four areas for skiers and 
snowboarders as well as two destinations that cater to those who prefer cross 
country skiing. Each locale is within reasonable driving distance for residents 
traveling from Pennsylvania, the Tri-State area (New York, New Jersey, 
Connecticut) and Massachusetts.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> &ldquo;Connecticut is a great destination for skiers of all levels, which 
is why we attract many families comprising of different age groups,&rdquo; said 
RandyFiveash, Tourism Director of the Connecticut Office of Tourism. &ldquo;Our 
ski destinations are conveniently located in areas that are short drives from 
great historical and cultural attractions, as well as high-end boutique-style 
shopping, fine dining and live entertainment for continued activities off the 
slopes.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p> 
<p> Highlights of Connecticut ski areas include:&nbsp;</p> 
<p> <strong>Mohawk Mountain, </strong>set in the foothills of the Berkshire 
Mountains, is the state&rsquo;s oldest and largest ski area, located in the
