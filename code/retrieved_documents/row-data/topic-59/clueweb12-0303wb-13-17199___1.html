<h3>2008/2009</h3>

Programs, Children's Center, Day Care]`</p>

<p><b>Sierra-at-Tahoe</b>, home to some of the finest tree skiing at Lake 
Tahoe, has recently opened five backcountry access gates. The gates, accessed 
from the top of Grandview chairlift, open the resort up to adventurous 
backcountry skiing and snowboarding.<br>
<br>
 &quot;Some of the chutes and 
terrain rivals the steepest terrain around Lake Tahoe,&quot; comments 
Sierra-at-Tahoe's Patrol Director, Robert Schultz. Not only does the terrain 
provide more advanced skiing and snowboarding, but also offers the remoteness 
and serenity easily appreciated in the Sierra Nevada.</p> 
<p>Long known as the best place on the mountain to ski, the West Bowl now 
offers more enticing reasons to spend the day here. The West Bowl Smokehouse 
BBQ offers the best mesquite tri-tip and ribs this side of Texas. The Cocktail 
waitresses in Chaps, a full bar that Doc Holiday would be proud of, and the 
smell of hickory in the air - it may seem like the OK Corral but between the 
beach chairs and the hot reggae tunes, the style is definitely Californian.</p> 
<p>Introducing the all <b>NEW Burton Progression Park</b> with boxes, jumps 
and rails all located inches from the ground, perfect for those wanting to test 
gravity one inch at a time. And with our Burton Learn-to-Ride programs, you'll 
be jibbing and hucking in no time.</p> 
<p>The <b>South Shore Complimentary Shuttle</b> is available daily, servicing 
more than 40 casinos and lodging properties in South lake Tahoe, providing a 
comfortable and convenient alternative to driving. For more information, please 
call the Shuttle Bus Information at (530) 541-7548.</p>
