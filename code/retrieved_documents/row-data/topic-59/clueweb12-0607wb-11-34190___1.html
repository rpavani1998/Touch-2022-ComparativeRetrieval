<p> <strong>Heavenly Ski Experience</strong> <br>
<br>
 Skiing at Heavenly is 
an unforgettable experience replete with stunning mountain vistas, deep powdery 
chutes, flawlessly groomed trails, and state of the art lifts. Year after year 
visitors flock to Heavenly because, quite frankly, it offers some of the 
greatest skiing in the area. The resort covers a stunning 4,800 acres which 
span two states, 3,500 feet of vertical and the highest summit in Lake Tahoe at 
10,067 feet!<br>
<br>
 The nearly 100 runs at Heavenly suit a variety of ages 
and abilities, 20% beginner runs, 45% intermediate trails and the remaining 35% 
are reserved especially for expert and advanced skiers. There is also a massive 
amount of acreage dedicated to backcountry and Heavenly&rsquo;s three gates 
access some of the most intense, steep and exhilarating backcountry in all the 
region. Advanced skiers should head to Gunbarrel and experience massive moguls 
and more than a 1,800 vertical feet descent. Heavenly boasts nearly 400 inches 
of snow and snowmaking on 73% of their trails, so conditions will be optimal no 
matter the weather.<br>
<br>
 Heavenly also proudly boasts an extensive ski and 
snowboard school as well as a daycare and nursery for the little ones. The 
lessons cater to all ages, ability and skill levels. There are a range of 
private lessons and group lessons for children as well as adults, whether 
it&rsquo;s skiing, snowboarding or telemarking, Heavenly&rsquo;s exquisite ski 
school has the ideal class.<br>
<br>
 Heavenly works hard to be a well-rounded 
resort and offers guests amenities such as lockers, storage, medical 
facilities, and a complimentary shuttle. It also houses Adventure Peak which is 
a fun place for children as well as the Heavenly Flyer Zipline. There is a 
tubing park, snowshoeing, cross country and hiking available as well. 
It&rsquo;s an ideal resort for families, couples and groups because it offers 
such a wide variety of activities, accommodations, and dining options.<br>
