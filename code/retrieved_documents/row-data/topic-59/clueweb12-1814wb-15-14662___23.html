<p>In Part I and Part II of 'Skiing', we explored the basic expectations of 
your first experience with skiing. We discussed ways to prepare for your first 
day on the slopes, including how to get into shape, and what clothing you 
should wear to keep you warm and dry. We talked about what you can expect when 
you arrive at the ski resort, weighed the options for choosing your equipment, 
and we touched on the fundamentals of skiing. Now, it's time to strap on your 
skis and hit the slopes.&nbsp;</p> 
<h3>Skiing basics</h3> 
<p>Comic-genius Stephen Wright used to joke, &quot;You know that feeling when 
you're leaning back in your chair, and you lean too far back, and you almost 
fall over backwards, but then you catch yourself at the last second? I feel 
like that all the time...&quot; Once you are actually standing in the snow, 
with the skis attached to your feet, you'll be feeling like that all the time. 
When you first realize that you can't hold your balance the way you normally 
could, this is the moment where terror strikes, and everything you were taught 
about skiing tends to go out the window. But take heart, and remember these 
tips about navigating on skis.</p> 
<p><b>Getting Around on Skis</b><br>
How are you supposed to get around with 
these things on your feet? Walking forward is just one foot in front of the 
other, you'll just be taking bigger steps. If you opted for ski poles, they 
will help you to keep steady.</p> 
<p>But, what happens when you're trying to get up a small slope, which you're 
probably going to do very early on? Well, you can try taking &quot;Herring 
Bone&quot; steps. This is when you point your skis out at an angle, separating 
the front of your skis, and forming like a &quot;V-shape,&quot; while pressing 
the edges down into the snow a little bit to get some grip, and trying not to 
step on your own skis. For sharper inclines, you might have to do a side step. 
Turn to the side, perpendicular to the slope; move your first ski up, get a 
good grip, and then bring your other ski up next to it.</p> 
<p><b>Coming to a Stop</b><br>
Usually, the first question on every beginner's 
mind is &quot;How do you stop?&quot; For the absolute beginners, the best way 
to stop is usually to simply fall down. For example, if you start down the 
slope for the first time, and you start picking up speed, don't panic and lock 
up. Just bend your knees, and drop gently to the ground.</p> 
<p>When you are finally able to push off and glide along the snow for the 
first time, you will quickly have to learn to stop. The basic way for all 
beginners is usually a &quot;snowplow,&quot; also called a &quot;wedge&quot;, 
and sometimes younger kids call that a &quot;pizza.&quot; What's happening here 
is, you're going to bring the tips of your skis together in a sort of upside 
down-V, opposite of what you did for the Herring Bone. This is where you want 
to keep your legs strong, because you don't want your skis to cross and overlap 
each other. You're pushing against the snow to slow down, so you're also going 
to apply pressure to the outside edge of your skis, enhancing that snowplow 
effect. You can apply this method more gently if you just want to slow down a 
little bit. Now, while you're learning to do this basic snowplow, it's also 
interesting to know that this is one of the simplest ways to turn.</p> 
<p><b>Turning</b><br>
Let's say you're going down a gentle slope, and you 
decide you're going to snowplow to slow yourself down. While you're 
snowplowing, put a little extra lean on your left leg, applying pressure down 
onto the inner-edge of the ski. You'll find yourself gliding a little more 
towards the right. Naturally, if you apply a little more to your right ski, 
you'll find yourself gliding towards the left. Suddenly, you realize that 
you've just learned how to make a turn. It's literally as simple as that. Of 
course, this is only the beginning.</p> 
<p>By watching the more experienced skiers going left and right down a steep 
slope, you'll soon realize that the snowplow is only going to get you so far 
for so long. Keep this in mind, as you watch those advanced skiers come down 
the slope; put simply, they are simply using a more exaggerated method of the 
principle we just talked about.</p> 
<p>For example, they're coming down harder and faster. So whereas we just 
applied a little bit of pressure to one ski to slow down and turn, they're 
going to have to apply a lot more pressure. To make that left turn, they're 
going to have to throw all their weight down onto the right ski; in fact, they 
will have to lift up that left ski, and throw both skis down so they are 
traveling in the same direction. This is why skiier must keep thier legs bent 
and stay flexible, because they need to be ready to give a little bounce when 
they want to change course. This is also when you will be happy you did some 
strength training in your legs. This action of shifting your balance and 
throwing your weight on different skis, is the way you slow your body down, and 
change course. Essentially, that's what skiing is. It's the art of slowing 
yourself and changing direction, to easily navigate the slope.</p> 
<p>This is, of course, completely counterintuitive to a beginner's first 
instinct to throw down the skis, pointing towards the bottom of the slope, and 
just go forward. You're going to be in a constant state of motion where you're 
changing directions and slowing yourself down periodically. It's very rare that 
you see a skier just pointing straight down the mountain. Even when you see an 
advanced skier doing that, he's never going faster than he can control. He 
knows that he needs to slow himself down. He might go forward for a little 
while, then apply pressure to his skis to change direction and slow himself 
back down.</p> 
<p>The name of the game is staying in control.</p> 
<p>This is why we start out on hills that are not very steep at all. You only 
want to go as fast as your stopping ability will allow, as you are learning to 
control your skis and stop yourself. As you get better at stopping, as you get 
better at changing direction, you can start to tackle steeper hills.</p> 
<p>As I mentioned earlier, there are only two speeds for a beginner; too fast 
and too slow. But, as you start to get better, and as you learn to control 
yourself on the skis, you start to move more toward the center. You will find 
that middle ground where skiing becomes exciting and fun.</p> 
<p>That's the science of skiing as I have come to understand it. Now, how 
about a few more practical things before you head off to the lift to catch up 
with your friends and show them what you've learned?</p> 
<p><b>Getting Up After a Fall</b><br>
The first time you try to stand up in 
skis after falling down, you'll feel like a turtle on its back. So, what's the 
best way to do this? Anytime you need to stop on the slope, either due to a 
fall, or just to adjust our equipment, always place your skis perpendicular to 
the slope. This is the one position where they won't be facing up or downhill, 
so they won't slide. So step one is to try and get yourself perpendicular with 
the slope.</p> 
<p>The next thing is to try to get the skis down hill. Try to rotate your body 
so that your skis are actually down hill, and your head is pointing towards the 
top of the slope. This helps because, as you're lying on the slope, the gravity 
is at your feet, and your body is already shifted towards an upright position. 
In other words, if you're laying down on a very sharp incline, you don't have 
to push yourself up as far for you to be standing vertical. So, always try to 
position yourself so that your skis are downhill.</p> 
<p>If your skis are more or less still parallel to each other, you're in good 
shape. Try to position your skis perpendicular to the slope. Now, you want to 
pull your inside leg up a little bit higher. When I say &quot;inside leg,&quot; 
I mean the leg that's closest to the ground. For example, you're laying down on 
your right side, and your head is pointed toward the top of the slope. Looking 
down, your skis are pointed toward the right side of the slope, and are now 
perpendicular to the slope. You're going to pull your right leg up a little 
bit, and now if you push up with your arms, you should be able to get yourself 
on top of the two skis to stand up. You can use your ski poles to help you by 
pushing yourself up on the poles to get yourself upward.</p> 
<p>Now, if you've really got yourself tangled up, you can try another way. 
Roll yourself onto your stomach. When you get to the point where your thighs 
and knees are on the ground, bend your knees, so your skis will go up in the 
air and straighten themselves out. If you can turn your ankles in the same 
direction, keeping your skis parallel, then roll to your side and push yourself 
up normally. If you're having trouble getting to your side, then twist your 
feet so that your heels are coming together and your toes are pointed out, you 
can now put your legs down so that your skis are back on the ground, forming a 
V-shape. Then, you'll come back up on your knees and try to push yourself up. 
You should be able to push yourself off, put your rear end up in the air, and 
then stand up. It's not very graceful to look at, but neither is sitting in the 
snow for too long.</p> 
<p><b>Recovering your Skis</b><br>
What happens if you fall and lose one of 
your skis? What's the trick to getting the ski back on? The rule of thumb is 
that it's always easier to step uphill. If you try to step downhill into your 
ski, it's going to be really easy to lose your balance. Place the ski next to 
you so that it's perpendicular to the slope, then turn around or move your ski 
so that the ski is uphill, and then step up into the ski.</p> 
<p>Now, with that out of the way, I think you're ready to hit the lifts, and 
join the rest of your crew who are tearing up the slopes.</p> 
<p></p> 
<h3>Ski lifts</h3> 
<p>The first time you get on a ski lift might be a little intimidating, but 
you'll be surprised how easy it really is, and how nice the ride to the top can 
be. When the time comes, be alert and keep moving forward in line. When it's 
your time to board the lift, you will be directed where to stand. You'll know 
exactly when it's time to sit down, as the chair will simply come up behind you 
and scoop you up. From there it's just a nice, enjoyable ride to the top.</p> 
<p>Getting off is just as easy. You'll always know when it's time to step off. 
As you get to the top, and it's almost time to step off, you'll scoot up to the 
edge of the chair, and when your skis meet the snow, you'll know it's time to 
slip off.</p> 
<h3>Navigating the trails</h3> 
<p>Now, when you're actually on your own and hitting the slopes, make sure 
that you bring a trail map with you. Every ski trail has a trail map so that 
you'll know which ski trail is the easiest, which are intermediate, and which 
trails are the most difficult. You'll always be able to identify the trails 
according to their markings. The trails are always clearly marked according to 
their difficulty levels, and the markings are usually universal. The easier 
trails are marked with a green circle. The intermediate trails are marked with 
a blue square. Of course, the more difficult or expert trails are marked by a 
black diamond, or for the really difficult trails, two black diamonds, or a 
&quot;double black diamond.&quot; Naturally, you want to start off on the 
greens. Stick to those until you're ready to tackle the blues, and then, when 
you're ready to ace the blacks, that's when you're going to feel like James 
Bond trying to outrun the villains.</p> 
<h3>Knowing when to hit the lodge</h3> 
<p>Later on, after you've been carving up the snow for a few hours, if you 
find yourself falling down more often, and you're getting a little bit 
frustrated, take heart; your skiing ability isn't slipping away from you. Your 
body is just telling you that you're getting tired, which basically means its 
time to hit the lodge and warm up with a cold beer, a hot chocolate, or a nice 
Irish coffee.</p> 
<p>Once you discover that apr&egrave;s ski after a long day of carving up the 
slopes, you can officially call yourself a skier.</p> 
<h3>Ski destinations</h3> 
<p>As we said earlier, after your first day, you're either going to love 
skiing, or you're going to hate it. My guess is that you're going to love it. 
Maybe you'll get so good that you're going to venture off to some more 
challenging ski locations. If you're on the East Coast, the best skiing is in 
New England, in states like Vermont, New Hampshire, and Maine. Of course, for 
the best skiing in the United States, the real skiing is out in Colorado.</p> 
<p>Once you've mastered the U.S. slopes, you can really follow in the 
footsteps of 007 and head to Europe; specifically the Alps, the Mecca of 
skiing. Countries like Austria, France, Italy, and of course, Switzerland are 
the major Alpine countries, and Bond has skied most of them. What this all 
means is that, if you find yourself being seduced by skiing, if you learn to 
love it, you'll go often, and you'll get better. Once that happens, the 
possibilities are endless. The world is your oyster. One day, you might even 
find yourself carving up the Swiss Alps, just like James Bond.</p> 
<h3>Safety and etiquette</h3> 
<p>As a beginner, the other skiers are going to be very forgiving of your 
mistakes, but it's quite another thing to be reckless and stupid. Here are some 
things to keep in mind as you set out onto the slopes:</p> 
<p><b>Keep Control</b><br>
Always keep control and able to stop when you need 
to, especially when avoiding objects or other people. If you find yourself in a 
situation where you're going too fast, and can't get control, just bend your 
knees and go down to the ground. That hurts a lot less than crashing into 
another skier.</p> 
<p><b>Keep Your Eyes Forward</b><br>
People ahead of you have the right of 
way. It's your responsibility to avoid them, just as the people behind you are 
responsible to avoid you. Keep your eyes forward and stay sharp.</p> 
<p><b>Don't Stand Around the Slope</b><br>
Try not to stop and stand in the 
middle of the trail so that other skiers have to try to avoid you. If you need 
to pause to catch your breath or get your bearings, move to the outer edges of 
the slope. And always keep visible.</p> 
<p><b>Look Before Merging</b><br>
Whenever you're stepping onto a trail 
midway, or your trail merges with another trail, be sure look uphill and yield 
to other skiers.</p> 
<p><b>Hold Onto Your Equipment</b><br>
Always use devices to prevent runaway 
equipment. Keep your hands through the straps of your poles so you don't lose 
them, and if you find yourself losing your skis a little too frequently, your 
bindings might need an adjustment. So head back in the rental office and get 
them adjusted.</p> 
<p><b>Read the Signs</b><br>
Pay attention to the posted signs and warnings. 
Watch for signs indicating the trail's difficulty levels, and avoid the trails 
that have been closed off.</p> 
<p><b>Be Aware at the Ski Lift</b><br>
Stay sharp when you're getting on and 
getting off the ski lift. Getting distracted when it's your turn to board the 
lift can lead to some embarrassing, and possibly dangerous moments. Use your 
head, and follow what the other skiers are doing.</p> 
<h3>Snowboarding</h3> 
<p>In my mind, if Ian Fleming's James Bond was a skier, then I am a skier; but 
having said that, it would be remiss if I didn't talk about snowboarding. After 
all, James Bond snowboards (technically,) in A View to a Kill. In fact, you 
could even make the argument that James Bond did a lot to push snowboarding 
into the mainstream. At the time A View to a Kill was released in the mid-80s, 
the idea of somebody surfing on snow was so strange that the filmmakers even 
decided to highlight the absurdity by adding that awful surfing music that 
makes most Bond fans cringe. However, if James Bond can lose his skis and 
easily jump onto a snowboard, then it's something that Being James Bond should 
touch on.</p> 
<p>Much of what we've covered so far about skiing also applies to 
snowboarding; including conditioning, clothing, and navigating the slopes. 
Snowboarding has become widely acceptable in most ski areas, and you should 
also be able to find yourself some snowboarding classes.</p> 
<p>So, what are the differences between skiing and snowboarding?</p> 
<p>I've heard different schools of thought when it comes to the similarities 
between skiing and snowboarding, but one thing is for sure; just because you 
have good skiing experience, doesn't mean you can switch easily over to a 
snowboard. (And, I can vouch for that. The first time I tried to snowboard, it 
was an absolute fiasco.) On the other hand, if you do have some experience 
carving up the snow, you at least know a few general principles, but don't 
expect your body to communicate with the snowboard in the same way it 
communicates with skis.</p> 
<p>If you are an absolutely beginner about to set out on the slopes for the 
first time, it might good to decide up front if you want to be a skier or a 
snowboarder. Here are a few of the differences that you should consider before 
making the choice:</p> 
<p>Stopping a snowboard is a little bit awkward. Snowboarders are always 
exerting energy to stay on the edge of their board if they way to keep from 
sliding. Either that or they have to sit down. Plus, you don't have the poles 
to keep you upright and stationary. Another difference is that snowboarding 
tends to be easier on the knees than skiing. Knee injuries are a lot less 
common on snowboards than on skis. On the other hand, snowboarding can be 
pretty rough on your wrists, so you should probably wear some protective wrist 
guards. Flat surfaces can be particularly frustrating for snowboarders, because 
you don't have your poles to move you forward. The only thing you can do to get 
around is to take one foot out of your snowboard and just walk.</p> 
<p>Another difference between snowboarding and skiing is that snowboarding 
works better in deeper, softer snow, whereas skis are much better handling 
bumps and ice. Also, they say that getting up on a snowboard is easier than 
getting up and getting yourself together on skis.</p> 
<p>Now, if you're learning to ski just to get your adrenaline going, it might 
surprise you that skiers get a lot more velocity than snowboarders, so factor 
that in when you're making your decision.</p> 
<p>I hope I didn't show too much bias in this explanation, but as I love to 
remind my snowboarding friends, if Fleming's Bond skied, I ski! Of course, 
there's plenty of room on the slope for all of us, so whatever you decide to do 
is fine. Both activities will give you a great feeling at the end of the day, 
as you're relaxing in the lodge.</p> 
<p>With that out of the way, we're almost at the end of this article on skiing.
</p> 
<p>To learn more about skiing, you can check out The Essential Guide to 
Skiing: 201 Things Every Skier Must Know by Ron LaMaster, and Essentials of 
Skiing: The Fastest Way to Master the Slopes by Harold Harp, which also came 
with an instructional DVD. There were even a few great websites offering some 
good tips and techniques for learning to ski. Check out ABC of Skiing (
www.abc-of-skiing.com/learn-skiing), Ski Great (www.skigreat.com) and GETskiing 
(www.getskiing.net), all of which had some great videos or animations to help 
explain good skiing techniques.</p> 
<p>And of course, there is no better way to learn than to hit the slopes and 
take a skiing class with a qualified instructor. Even if you already have some 
experience, a few lessons should really bring out your personal best, and take 
your skiing ability to the next level.</p> 
<p>Now before we finish out this article, we're going to have to make one 
stop. As promised, we're going to visit Piz Gloria on Mount Schilthorn in 
Murren, Switzerland.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<h3>PIZ GLORIA</h3> 
<p>When it comes to skiing, Switzerland is unmatched, and when it comes to 
Bond locations, there is one that is second to none. The grandfather of all 
Bond ski chases started at Piz Gloria, and endured down the side of Mount 
Schilthorn, in Murren, Switzerland.</p> 
<p>Getting to Piz Gloria can be half the adventure. A train from the town of 
Interlaken will take you to nearby Lauterbrunnen, where a few scenes from On 
Her Majesty's Secret Service were shot. From there you take funicular right up 
the side of the mountain. At your next stop, another rail will take you into 
the town of Murren, and from there it's two gondola lifts up into the 
mountains, and to the outstanding Bond location Piz Gloria.</p> 
<p>Make sure you're dressed appropriately. It was a mild spring afternoon on 
the day I went, but by the time I stepped off the gondola onto Piz Gloria at 
that altitude, it felt like a blustery winter afternoon, just as it must have 
felt when they filmed On Her Majesty's Secret Service.</p> 
<p>Once inside Piz Gloria, it seemed that little had changed since James Bond 
was here. Walking up the stairway along its familiar golden balustrade to the 
revolving restaurant will make even the mildest fan of On Her Majesty's Secret 
Service feel as if they were about to walk into a room filled with exotic women 
from around the world and only moments away from confronting his most dangerous 
adversary. Be sure and order the James Bond Breakfast Special, complete with 
champagne and scrambled eggs.</p> 
<p>Piz Gloria still pulsates with the feeling of stepping into a James Bond 
film. Atop Mount Schilthorn in the village of Murren, Piz Gloria offers views 
that extend along the Bernese Alps to Mount Blanc on a clear day, and walking 
along the terrace, you can still envision the curling rink and the helipad 
where Bond let the aerial assault on Blofeld's fortress.</p> 
<p>As much as we enjoy visiting well-known Bond locations, Piz Gloria 
certainly enjoys being one. Underneath the terrace is the Tourist-O-Rama. Press 
the '007' button in the center of the large circular room, and with a low 
mechanical hum, the shades will slowly lower on all the windows, and visitors 
can relive Bond's adventures in Switzerland through a panoramic slide 
presentation about the preparation and filming of On Her Majesty's Secret 
Service, including a video montage of the highlights of the film.</p> 
<p>Upstairs is the gift shop where there are airbrush murals of Bond and 
Tracy; I hope you like a little nostalgia. You'll find a few souvenirs here 
from you trip with a classic 007 insignia.</p> 
<p>Once you've had a hearty meal in the restaurant and just before you're 
about to throw down your skis and ski down Mount Schilthorn, don't forget to 
stop off at the James Bond bar for a cocktail. Be sure to order a malt whiskey 
with branch water, of course.</p> 
<p>For more information on Piz Gloria and Mount Schilthorn, look them up on 
the web at&nbsp;www.schilthorn.ch, or e-mail them at&nbsp;info.schilthorn.ch.
</p> 
<p>And with that, that concludes this article on skiing.</p> 
<p>Good luck, and I'll &quot;see ya back at the lodge!&quot;</p>
