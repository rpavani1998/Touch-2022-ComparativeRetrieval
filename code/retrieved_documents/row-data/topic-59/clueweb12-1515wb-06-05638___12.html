<h2>How to Plan the Perfect Snowboarding Vacation</h2> 
<p>without comments</p> 
<p>While skiers used to rule the slopes, more and more people are now sliding 
over the slopes on snowboards. In some areas, snowboarders seem to be taking 
over the slopes completely. Some skiers are now dabbling in snowboarding, but 
many boarders are new to the slopes. Before taking up snowboarding, they never 
really enjoyed the cold, wet snow. The board has brought them out of hiding in 
the winter months and given them a form of physical activity they find 
enjoyable. If you may be among them this winter, make sure to consider the 
condition of the slopes before you head out for those first runs.</p> 
<p><strong>Snowboarding Vacation Resorts</strong></p> 
<p>Whether snowboarding is your only vacation goal or just one element of your 
vacation, you can&rsquo;t go wrong by visiting a resort. Many will offer 
snowboarding lessons, so you don&rsquo;t have to teach yourself how to board. 
Most states in the U.S. that get a lot of snow will have resorts dotted along 
their terrain, especially those near mountain ranges. Not only do these resorts 
offer snowboarding opportunities, but they offer a variety of sports suitable 
to the mounds of wet, white snow.</p> 
<p><strong>Some of the more popular areas in the U.S. include:</strong></p> 
<ul> 
<li>Squaw Valley, California</li> 
<li>Sun Valley, Idaho</li> 
<li>Moonlight Basin, Montana</li> 
<li>Heavenly, Nevada</li> 
<li>Jackson Hole, Wyoming</li> </ul> 
<p>Utah is one of the biggest states for snowboarding. You can find resorts 
all across the state and many are perfectly suited&nbsp;for planning a&nbsp;
<strong>snowboarding vacation</strong>. Some of the best resorts include:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Deer Valley</li> 
<li>The Canyons</li> 
<li>Snowbird</li> 
<li>Park City</li> </ul> 
<p>Colorado is another big state for snowboarders. This is the capital of 
winter resorts in the United States, so you will never struggle to find an open 
resort. Whether you just want to snowboard or you want to pack in adventures on 
skis and explore other winter sports as well, you will find it all in this 
state. Aspen is the most popular area in the state, but some of the top resorts 
across the state include:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Snowmass</li> 
<li>Copper Mountain</li> 
<li>Crested Butte</li> 
<li>Keystone</li> 
<li>Breckenridge</li> 
<li>Tulluride</li> 
<li>Steamboat Springs</li> 
<li>Vail</li> 
<li>Winter Park</li> 
<li>Beaver Creek</li> </ul> 
<p>If you are traveling in Canada, look for resorts in Lake Louise and 
Whistler.</p> 
<p><strong>Preparing for a Snowboarding Vacation</strong></p> 
<p>You only need two things to have a great snowboarding vacation: the perfect 
location and the desire to get out there and have fun. If this will be your 
first time on a snowboard, add the desire to learn something new to that list. 
There is a lot of excitement and thrill that comes with gliding down a mountain 
on a board, but this sport can also be dangerous if you don&rsquo;t have the 
right snowboarding gear and knowledge.</p> 
<p>Make sure to plan a lesson or two before you hit the slopes alone. You have 
to learn the safety guidelines so you make it back safe and sound. Once you 
know the basics of the sport, you can have an adventurous&nbsp;snowboardiing 
vacation&nbsp;without putting your life in danger.</p> 
<p>Once you decide which resort you want to visit, try to schedule 
snowboarding lessons ahead of time. This ensures you get into the lessons soon 
after arriving,&nbsp;that way&nbsp;you can spend the rest of the time improving 
your skills.&nbsp; If you bring all of your gear rather than renting it there, 
you can hit the slopes immediately without standing around in lines.</p> 
<p>The most important rule is to have fun on your snowboarding vacation. 
Safety comes first, but fun is a close second!</p>

<h2>The Best Colorado Snowboarding Destinations</h2> 
<p>without comments</p> 
<p>Snowboarding is picking up more fans with each passing year, but that 
hasn&rsquo;t changed the fact that skiers are never thrilled to see boards on 
their trails. If you want to stay away from conflict and go where you are 
welcome, it is important to identify trails suitable for snowboarders. You will 
have a better time on trails suitable to boarders and you will enjoy the 
companionship of many other boarders.</p> 
<p>If you want to board in Colorado, there are three destinations that are hot 
for boarders. Not only do they offer great runs for snowboarding, but they 
offer a hassle-free environment where boarders are free to explore. So, check 
out these<strong>Colorado snowboarding</strong> destinations</p> 
<p><strong>Breckenridge</strong></p> 
<p>There are just fewer than 150 runs at this destination and the skill levels 
are scattered to include everyone. Whether you are a pro or a complete 
beginner, there is a trail for you to explore in Breckenridge.&nbsp; For the 
tricksters in the pack, there are three terrain parks, such as Freeway 
Superpark. This terrain park is the home of a few snowboarding competitions and 
gets the most attention from boarders in Colorado. There is another terrain 
park more suitable for beginners, so you don&rsquo;t have to jump into the big 
leagues right away.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Keystone</strong></p> 
<p>If you are going for an extended stay, hop on a shuttle and hit some runs 
at Keystone. The tickets are interchangeable between Breckenridge and Keystone, 
so you can enjoy daytime boarding in Breckenridge then hit up Keystone for the 
nightlife. The huge historic district is the largest in the state and comes 
with shopping opportunities, restaurants serving delicious food, and oxygen 
bars for lively entertainment. Enjoy some party time and get shuttled right to 
the peaks when it is time to gear up and get serious again.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Keystone also offers amusements beyond snowboarding, including:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Ice Skating</li> 
<li>Snowmobiling</li> 
<li>Dog Sledding</li> 
<li>Hiking</li> </ul> 
<p>No matter what time of year it may be, there is something to do at 
Breckenridge and Keystone.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Vail</strong></p> 
<p>This is one of the largest and most reputable ski resorts in the country 
and it happens to be perfect for those just exploring snowboarding. They offer 
quite a few runs just for beginners, plus a school with more than 800 
instructors who speak a variety of languages. Those who know what they are 
doing and want to turn some tricks, there is a terrain park as well.</p> 
<p>For boarders with experience, there are many different trails that offer 
challenge and blood-rushing adventure.&nbsp; Free shuttles are also offered 
into town for shopping, dining out, and a few bars to relax in and have a good 
time.&nbsp; There are actually hundreds of shops and restaurants, so there is 
always something to do in Vail.</p> 
<p>If you want to visit the best resorts&nbsp;for Colorado snowboarding, pick 
one of these. All others will leave you disappointed.</p>

<h2>Snowboarding Europe on Any Budget</h2> 
<p>without comments</p> 
<p>What do you do when the temperatures plummet, the snow starts to fall, and 
you can no longer walk out the front door in flip flops? Many people take 
vacations or head to vacation homes in locations where flip flops are still 
appropriate, but others jump for joy and drag out the snowboards. These are the 
people who love the joys that come with the cold winter season. These are 
people who will gladly trade their flip flops in for their snowboarding boots, 
jackets, and goggles.</p> 
<p>If you are one of these winter-loving thrill seekers, there is no better 
place to hit the trails than Europe. No matter what your budget may be, there 
are destinations just perfect for you. To get your trip planning started, here 
are just five of the best European snowboarding destinations.</p> 
<p><strong>1. Switzerland</strong></p> 
<p>From the stunning views of the Alps to the amazing runs and top notch 
accommodations for visitors, you cannot find a better place to snowboard than 
Switzerland. The resorts offer packages that can work with any budget, so you 
don&rsquo;t have to go broke to put your board on the snow. The tourist offices 
are nicely designed and staffed, and transportation is never a problem. Top it 
all off with super friendly people and you see why so many flock to Switzerland 
to hit the trails every year.</p> 
<p><strong>2. Austria</strong></p> 
<p>Slip into a world where the modern mingles with the traditional and small 
chalet villages welcome visitors with open arms. You can reach the daring 
slopes of the Alps,&nbsp;and there are destinations for low budget as well as 
high budget snowboarding adventures.&nbsp;&nbsp; Daytime snowboarding is always 
full of adventure, but there is nothing like the Alps after dark.</p> 
<p><strong>3. Spain</strong></p> 
<p>Every year, snowboarders head to northern Spain to hit the trails of the 
Pyrenees. Besides the challenging and fun trails open to snowboarders, visitors 
get to immerse themselves in the dynamic culture of Spain for a complete 
vacation. There are many hotel rooms to be found at affordable prices, so low 
budget snowboarding is always an option.</p> 
<p><strong>4. France</strong></p> 
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t until the 1992 Olympic Games that most people realized 
France is a great place to hit the slopes. There are some excellent resorts, 
such as Megeve and Chamonix, where the slopes are perfect for the thrill of 
snowboarding. What is amazing about these resorts is that you step out the 
front door directly onto the slopes. No travel required, so you can get in more 
hours on the trails.</p> 
<p><strong>5. Italy</strong></p> 
<p>High altitude snowboarders with a true desire to feel their blood pump are 
now turning to Italy. This hasn&rsquo;t always been a hot spot for boarders, 
but the amazing mountains with high altitudes have turned that around. For 
those with an adventurous spirit and enough skill, this is an excellent 
snowboarding destination.</p>
