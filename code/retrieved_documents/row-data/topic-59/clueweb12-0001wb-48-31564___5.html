<h2>Ski Pucon Ski Center </h2> <br>
<br>
<br>

<p>Located on the slopes of one of the most well-studied volcanoes in South 
America, the Ski Pucon Ski Center offers its visitors more than just a place to 
ski: it also offers the opportunity to discover and enjoy one of the most 
beautiful zones of our country.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> This allows visitors to enjoy many other activities which will complement 
their skiing and see more of this unforgettable area. The center is inside the 
borders of the Villarrica National Park and from the slopes of the volcano you 
can observe five beautiful lakes as well as enjoy thermal baths and the 
nightlife in the nearby cities of Pucon and Villarrica.</p> 
<p>Managed by the Gran Hotel Pucon, this center has nine lifts of seat and 
surface types between the different grades of slopes, making it easy to move 
between slopes. The center offers various services to complement your skiing 
experience and help your holiday run smoothly: a cafeteria, equipment hire, 
parking, a small medical clinic and skiing classes.</p> 
<p>The access to the center is via an unpaved road and during the season we 
recommend you use snow-chains.</p>
