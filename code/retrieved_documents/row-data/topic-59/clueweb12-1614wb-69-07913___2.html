<h1>Edmonton Ski Club &ndash; About Us</h1> 
<p>Edmonton Ski Club has five ski areas on it&rsquo;s site of varying degrees 
of difficulty.</p> 
<p><strong>Bunny Hill</strong> is the <strong>beginners area</strong> and is 
serviced by a tow rope. This area is marked as a green area and is regularly 
groomed and has a small pitch which enables beginners in Skiing or Snowboarding 
to learn how to get started and the different techniques required to move on to 
a more difficult terrain.</p> 
<p><strong>T-Bar</strong> is our longest run and has varying pitches. <strong>
Intermediate and more advanced</strong> skier and snowboarding area. Often 
groomed at the lift line as the area is used on a regular basis by Race Teams 
as a training area. With more gentler pitches off to the right of the lift line 
for skiers and boarders that are moving on to more difficult terrain with 
instructors.</p> 
<p><strong>Grassy</strong> is our shortest run and is often left ungroomed. It 
is not serviced by a direct lift line but can be accessed from T-Bar and Twin 
Birch. Surrounded by natural tree lines Skiers and Boarders often enjoy this 
area when we have benefited from a natural snow fall as the pitch often gathers 
many centimeters of powder snow.</p> 
<p><strong>Twin Birch</strong> is our steepest pitched run and is classed as a 
<strong>Black Diamond</strong>. This area is for skiers and boarders that are 
at a more<strong>advanced level</strong> and is serviced by a poma lift. To the 
right from the lift line there is a 36ft wide area of small moguls.</p> 
<p>The <strong>Terrain Park</strong> is serviced by two lifts Tin Can and 
Bunny Tow. Again this area has a variety of pitches, jumps, rails, bars and 
tubes. For skiers and boarders that are at a more<strong>advanced level</strong>
 of freestyle. All jumps, rails, bars and tubes are marked with the degree of 
difficulty, it is<strong>important</strong> for all boarders and skiers using 
this area to familiarize themselves with the<strong>Terrain Park Rules</strong>
. It is<strong>mandatory to wear a helmet when riding in this area. </strong>
<br> <strong>Boarders and Skiers using this area are not permitted to alter, 
build or introduce any new jumps, rails, bars or tubes without seeking full 
permission from the Edmonton Ski Club Management Team. Anyone found to be doing 
so will be removed from site and privileges revoked.</strong></p> <br>
