<h3>How to Take Great Skiing and Snowboarding Pictures</h3> 
<p> Cold, snowy conditions are tough on photographers. Add a fast-moving 
object on skis or a snowboard, and it's going to be even harder to capture a 
well-exposed, sharply focused image.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>When photographing skiers and snowboarders, timing means everything. In 
order to capture the action on the slopes effectively, the New York Institute 
of Photography, America&Otilde;s oldest and largest photography school, 
suggests that the photographer consult with the subject and learn his or her 
route in advance. The photographer can then set up the camera in advance and 
prefocus on a mutually-agreed upon spot before the subject whizzes by.</p> 
<p>In some cases, however, you may want to convey a sense of motion in your 
photos of the slopes. Chuck DeLaney, Dean of NYI, recommends panning with the 
subject to create this illusion of speed and motion in the image. 'Use a slow 
shutter speed, say, 1/30th,' he reminds his students, 'and follow the subject 
in your viewfinder as he approaches you, keep him there as you shoot, and keep 
following him after you shoot. You want to have a smooth motion, like a tennis 
player swinging and following through with the ball.'</p>
