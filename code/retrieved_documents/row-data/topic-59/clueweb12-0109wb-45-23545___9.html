<li></li> </ul> 
<p> Which New Zealand ski area to choose? Where to get weather information? 
How much will it cost? It&rsquo;s always handy to know certain things before 
hitting the slopes. Get prepped for New Zealand&rsquo;s ski season and check 
out fast facts on snowboarding and skiing New Zealand.</p>  &nbsp; 
<h4>Club Ski Areas</h4> 
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to be a member to ski on a New Zealand club ski area 
&ndash; anyone is welcome! The main drawcard of club ski areas is the price. 
For an adult lift pass you pay at least NZ$20 less than for an adult lift pass 
on a commercial ski area.</p> 
<p>Club ski areas are run by club members rather than by a company and slopes 
are less crowded. Club fields are smaller but offer a more social atmosphere 
and conditions are still varied and exciting. However, facilities are basic. 
Although most NZ club ski areas have day lodges, T-bar lifts or rope tows, they 
might not have snow grooming.</p> 
<p>Most club ski areas provide on-mountain ski accommodation, saving you 
travelling up the mountain on a daily basis. Ski accommodation ranges from 
budget accommodation with casual restaurants and backcountry huts with outdoor 
hot tubs with to ski lodges.</p> 
<h4>New Zealand Maps</h4> 
<p>Download destination-nz.com regional maps for FREE, or purchase detailed 
regional maps atwww.terralink.co.nz. If you&rsquo;re after an online address 
search and/or driving directions visitwww.wises.co.nz for interactive New 
Zealand maps.</p> 
<h4>New Zealand Recipes</h4> 
<p>New Zealand is a good-value destination for a snowboard or ski holiday, 
especially if you&rsquo;re travelling to New Zealand from the US, Australia or 
Europe. Expect to pay around NZ$15 to $45 for your apr&egrave;s-ski main meal, 
NZ$24 to $60 per day for full snowboard/ski hire and an average of NZ$30 per 
day for full ski clothing hire on the mountain. A night&rsquo;s accommodation 
starts at around NZ$15 for a dorm bed in a hostel and rises to NZ$300 (or more 
for the ultimate deluxe accommodation!). In terms of lift passes, a one-day 
adult lift pass costs NZ$70 to $99 at a commercial ski area or NZ$40 to $70 at 
a club field. Fine out more aboutNew Zealand's ski areas.</p> 
<h4>Qualmark</h4> 
<p>Qualmark, New Zealand tourism&rsquo;s official mark of quality, is awarded 
to New Zealandaccommodation and transport providers and NZ activity operators. 
Establishments carrying the Qualmark logo have been assessed as trustworthy and 
professional, and all types of accommodation are rated on a star grading system 
telling you exactly what to expect.&nbsp;</p> 
<h4>New Zealand Ski Season</h4> 
<p>The New Zealand ski season usually runs from June to October which means 
that you can hit New Zealand&rsquo;sski areas when the snow in America and 
Europe is long melted. Spring (September till November) is a good time for NZ 
skiing and snowboarding. A good base of snow combined with warmer air 
temperatures make for awesome spring skiing.</p> 
<h4>Travelling in New Zealand</h4> 
<p>New Zealand&rsquo;s temperate climate means that you can enjoy a myriad of 
NZ outdoor activities off the mountains even during peak ski season. If you 
feel like a day off from skiing, the snowy peaks of New Zealand&rsquo;s 
mountains provide a great backdrop forwater activities or golfing in the winter 
sun. Check out theregional pages for detailed information about New Zealand 
activities on offer.</p> 
<h4>New Zealand Weather Information</h4> 
<p>Before heading out to the mountains you should always check the weather. 
You can find detailed weather reports onNew Zealand ski areas and mountains on 
www.metservice.com. Click on the &lsquo;Mountains &amp; National Parks &ndash; 
Ski Fields&rsquo; link to find weather reports on each New Zealand ski area 
that are updated daily during the NZ ski season.</p>

which sends either one-off or daily alerts, as well as mountain condition

<h4>Ski Runs Colour Coding</h4> 
<p>New Zealand ski runs are graded according to difficulty and marked with the 
colours green, blue and black. Check out what the different colours stand for:
<br> <strong>GREEN</strong> = Easy. Green ski runs are usually groomed and wide 
and not too steep.<br>
<strong>BLUE</strong> = Intermediate. The bulk of runs 
in aski area are blue and they&rsquo;re usually the busiest pistes. <br>

<strong>BLACK</strong> = Advanced. Black ski runs are amongst the most 
difficult on a mountain and pretty steep.<br>
<strong>DOUBLE BLACK</strong> = 
Experts only! Double black ski runs are exceptionally steep and have obstacles 
such as trees or drop-offs.</p>
