<h1>  Cover yourself skiing and snowboarding </h1> 
<p>Skiing and snowboarding can be risky and injuries are common, even for the 
most experienced riders. Not all of our plans automatically include cover if 
you&rsquo;re in an accident on the hill, so check the list ofcovered adventure 
sports and activities and read the full description of cover before you hit the 
slopes. Need help working out which plan you&rsquo;ll need, ask us!</p> <br>

<br> 
<h1>Where can I ski or board?</h1> 
<p>In general, cover is available for recreational skiing or snowboarding on 
piste and in areas designated 'safe' by ski resort staff within the 
resort&rsquo;s boundaries.</p> 
<p>Some plans also cover off piste skiing and snowboarding, provided it is not 
done in restricted or unsafe areas. If you're thinking of more extreme skiing 
it's important to check with us and read the policy wording carefully because 
some of our insurers can't offer cover - they find it very difficult to verify 
the individual's ability and level of risk.</p> 
<h1>So what does safe mean?</h1> 
<p>Ski resorts are often held liable for all winter sports activities within 
their boundaries and so they take time to make sure the runs are groomed, the 
instructors are competent and any dangerous conditions like heavy snow, ice, 
and avalanche risks are properly managed or marked as closed or out of bounds. 
If you stay within these safe areas and keep within your ability, then we can 
help if you have an accident.</p> 
<p>Even if you&rsquo;re with a guide or you&rsquo;re an experience backcountry 
skier, if you go into closed areas or outside the resort boundaries, our 
insurers may decide you&rsquo;ve put yourself at needless risk and it&rsquo;s 
likely you wont be covered. We offer general travel insurance for adventurous 
travellers, not search and rescue cover, so we wont be able to come look for 
you in the wilderness.</p> 
<h1>What is covered?</h1> 
<p>To be covered for snowsports, you must choose the correct plan or adventure 
sport upgrade at the time you buy your policy. Check our list ofcovered 
adventure sports and activities to make sure you're choosing the correct plan 
for your winter adventure.</p> 
<p>Where you've bought a plan which includes the type of snowsports you'll be 
doing, there is cover for emergency medical treatment undertaken by qualified 
resort staff and any air evacuation or road ambulance transport to get you to 
the nearest suitable medical facility, all subject to theEmergency Assistance 
team&rsquo;s approval.</p> 
<p>Your winter sports equipment isn&rsquo;t covered while you&rsquo;re using 
it, but it may be covered if stolen from an official resort storage (where 
you&rsquo;ve checked it in, kept the receipt and have a police report within 24 
hours of it being stolen). Your gear wont be covered if you simply forget it or 
leave it anywhere where the general public has constant access or where items 
can be taken without your knowledge, including ski racks or roof racks (secured 
or not), unattended while you get lunch or in resort lockers in public areas.
</p> 
<p>Again, our insurers have different terms of cover, dependent on which 
country you are from, so check out the policy conditions carefully to make sure 
that the cover is right for you and your particular winter sporting adventure. 
If you're not sure justcall us or drop us an e-mail and we'll come straight 
back to you!</p> 
<p>Be sensible guys. Skiing causes a lot of medical claims and as pretty as 
the white stuff looks, it can be dangerous so let's be careful out there.</p> 
<h3>You are not covered where you are:</h3> <br>

<ol> 
<li>Willfully exposing yourself to a needless risk like cliff drops or taking 
on the double black diamond run after your first ever day on the slopes.</li> 
<li>Intoxicated or have taken illegal drugs where your ability and decision 
making is probably compromised.</li> 
<li>Backcountry or any areas out of bounds of the ski resort.</li> 
<li>Extreme skiing or snowboarding.</li> 
<li>If you choose one of our plans, which do not include cover for snowsports.
</li> 
<li>If you&rsquo;re in a race or competition. </li> 
<li>Injured while working where you should be covered by your employer.</li> 
</ol> <br>

<p>World Nomads is supported by different insurers from around the world. 
Always read your policy wording to review your specific coverage and to make 
sure that the policy is right for you.</p>
