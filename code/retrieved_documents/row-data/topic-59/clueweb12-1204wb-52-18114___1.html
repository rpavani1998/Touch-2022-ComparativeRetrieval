 Information on the winter sports; from downhill, Alpine 
skiing to cross-country, snowboarding and heli skiing. Also information on 
resorts easily accessible from Athens and bus services to these ski centres. 
<p><i>Did you know?</i></p> 
<ul> 
<li>Greece is the most mountainous country in Europe with over 75 percent of 
its land covered by mountains</li> 
<li>There are more than 1,000 mountain peaks of over 2,000m in Greece</li> 
<li>There are more than 20 ski resorts in north and central Greece as well as 
in the Peloponnese</li> </ul> 
<h5>Skiing in Greece</h5> 
<p>Winter sports in Greece are managed by the <b>Hellenic Ski Federation</b>, 
which oversees the resorts across the country and works to ensure that skiers 
in Greece comply with the rules and regulations for mountain conduct of the<b>
International Ski Federation</b>.</p> 
<p>The Greek ski season runs from December to May, depending on snow 
conditions.</p> 
<p>Many resorts offer a combination of pistes for downhill and cross-country 
skiing. Heli-skiing is available in northern Greece at the Pisoderi ski resort 
(555 Km from Athens). A sport for the more advanced skier or snowboarder, a 
helicopter drops the skier or snowboarder at the top of an otherwise 
inaccessible slope.</p> 
<ul>

</ul> 
<h5>On the Slopes</h5> 
<p>Ski slopes - or pistes - are graded by difficulty:</p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
&nbsp; &nbsp; <br>
<b>Green:&nbsp;<br>
 beginners/<br>
 nursery</b> <b>
Blue:&nbsp;<br>
 moderately easy</b> <b>Red:&nbsp;<br>
 difficult</b> <b>
Black:&nbsp;<br>
 experienced skiers</b> <b>Yellow:&nbsp;<br>
 very experienced 
skiers</b> <br>
<br>
<br>

<p><b>Note</b>: Yellow alpine routes are in a marked area, but are not 
groomed, are off-piste and unpatrolled.</p> 
<h5>Greek Ski Resorts</h5> 
<p>A lift-pass is needed to ski or snowboard in a resort. Passes are available 
for the day, for several days or on a seasonal basis. Lift-ticket prices 
usually go up on weekends, when resorts are more crowded. Proof of identity 
with a photograph may be needed when buying a lift pass.</p> 
<p>Most resorts offer accommodation: hotels, apartments or chalets, and have 
shops selling or renting ski equipment. Most resorts also have ski schools for 
all levels.</p> 
<p>Snowboarding is not as popular in Greece as it is in ski areas in Western 
Europe or the United States. Snowboarding is generally allowed at ski areas, 
though boarders will have to build their own jibs.</p>
