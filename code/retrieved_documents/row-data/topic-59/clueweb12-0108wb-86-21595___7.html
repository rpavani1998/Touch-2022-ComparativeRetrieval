<h1>Riders v. Skiers</h1> If you wish to join the &quot;Grays on Trays&quot; 
set, you may get a variety of reactions. Some of your skiing friends may be 
dismayed. Even today, you may find pockets of resistance. One Colorado 
resident, for example, wrote into the Aspen Times about an incident involving a 
friend of hers. The letter was published in January 2007--long after snowboards 
were introduced to the world.<br>
<br>
 The friend, she relates, was in the 
gondola (presumably at Ajax) with a ski instructor and some of his students. 
&quot;The instructor began talking about the X Games and how snowboarding was 
an such ugly sport and that it was a good thing that they 'wear baggy clothes' 
to cover up the ugliness that is snowboarding. One of them even said, 'It's a 
good thing there aren't any snowboarders in here' (the gondola). They looked at 
Nancy, and ignored what they obviously knew, that she was indeed a 
snowboarder.&quot;<br>
<br>
 Why did such attitudes persist, even if in much 
less frequency than in years past? Historically there has been some animosity 
among skiers and snowboarders. In fact,The Economist, the staid news magazine 
from London, noted the conflict in way back 1993, with its article &quot;Battle 
of the Piste.&quot;<br>
<br>
 Humorist Dave Barry took a more lighthearted view 
of matters in 1995 when he summed up the conflict this way: &quot;Skiers view 
snowboarders as a menace; snowboarders view skiers as Elmer Fudd.&quot;<br>
<br>
 While attitudes are changing and skiers and riders are mixing it up, a short 
history lesson may be useful.
<h3>Snowboarder-Resistance</h3> The snowboarding innovation was met with some 
resistance, to put it mildly. Most ski areas forbad snowboarding, and some that 
permitted it required riders to pass a competency test. For their part, some 
snowboarders were afflicted by the proverbial chip on the shoulder.<br>
<br>
 
For the longest time, snowboarders agitated to get access to the slopes. But 
today, you can count on one hand the number of U.S. ski areas that do not 
permit snowboards.
<h3>The Origins of the Conflict</h3> Opposition to and wariness of snowboards, 
historically and today, comes from a number of sources, including a variety of 
fears.<br>
<br>
<b>Culture clash</b> <br>
Many of the early riders, especially 
in California, came from a skateboarding culture and thus did not have a 
knowledge or history of ski etiquette. As a result, they were at odds with 
skiing's reputation as a sport of sophistication. This early clash grew into 
stereotypes on both sides, poisoning relations for years to come.<br>
<br>

While many skiers have made their peace with riders, some skiers see the two 
sports as fueled by two incompatible impulses. In this view, skiing emphasizes 
social and natural ambiance over athletic challenge, and snowboarding, by 
contrast, is dominated by an &quot;adrenalin-rush&quot; population that puts 
traditional skiers at risk.<br>
<br>
<b>Generation Gap</b> <br>
 In its early 
years, snowboarding was owned by the teenager demographic. The 
got-to-be-different imperative of the adolescent years spilled over into an 
&quot;attitude&quot; that looked less than fondly upon adults, who dominated 
skiing. Skiers, for their part, often returned the favor (&quot;young 
punks&quot;). Happily, snowboarding is now a sport for all ages.<br>
<br>
<b>
Media sensationalism</b> <br>
 News reports may have played a part as well. 
Lowell Hart (author of &quot;The Snowboard Book&quot;), reminds us that members 
of the news media sell articles and attract viewers through controversy. It's 
not that they create a story where none exist (though, if you remember Janet 
Cooke and Jason Blair, that sometimes happens); rather, conflict sells stories, 
which in turns may increase the magnitude of the conflict in the public's mind. 
<br><br>
<b>Fear of physical safety</b> <br>
The complaint that snowboarders go 
too fast, endangering the skier, also has a long history. The fact that riders 
tended to be younger (and hence more risk-accepting, or even risk-seeking) only 
compounded this objection.<br>
<br>
 This fear was observed by snowboarding 
pioneer Chris Sanders, who noted in 1985 that some ski areas had come to accept 
that &quot;we [snowboarders] aren't a bunch of reckless idiots.&quot; This 
means that some people thought that riders were in fact &quot;a bunch of 
reckless idiots.&quot; Accept the fact that some people still think this way, 
and do what you can to live down the reputation.<br>
<br>
<b>Liability concerns
</b> <br>
 Of course, early snowboarding equipment itself did not inspire 
confidence in the safety of the sport, which fueled the resistance of some 
insurance companies--and subsequently, ski areas. Looking back, it is easy to 
see how snowboards themselves could be seen as a dangerous piece of equipment. 
Features that we expect as standard of today--metal edges, secure bindings, and 
specialized boots most notably--did not exist.<br>
<br>
Controlling a board was 
more difficult than it is today, and combined with the risk-seeking attitude of 
the early riders, made for an understandable reluctance on the part of ski 
areas and many skiers.<br>
<br>
<b>Making the snow unskiable</b> <br>
 Other 
objections (then and now) to snowboarding stem from the fear that snowboards 
would create ruts (especially in groomed snow) and thus disrupt skiing. At the 
margins, this can cause problems for some skiers. Oddly enough, skiers 
sometimes lodge the contradictory complaint that snowboard riders &quot;push 
all the snow to the bottom of the hill.&quot; Either claim rests on the 
assumption that snowboarding somehow makes the snow unskiable.<br>
<br>
<b>
Changes to favorite skiing trails</b> <br>
 As snowboarding gained in 
popularity, many areas put in tricks-oriented features (e.g., rails) to appeal 
to freestyle-oriented snowboarders. This has also caused some animosity on the 
part of some skiers, who cite the terrain features as proof that snowboarding 
is taking away &quot;their&quot; slope. And in some case, it has.<br>
<br>
Some 
of the trails once used by the Grays on Trays publisher for skiing have been 
turned into terrain parks, for example.<br>
<br>
<b>Economic protectionism</b> 
<br> Some of the resistance to snowboarding--and conversely, today's embrace of 
it--comes down to dollars and cents. Or perhaps Euros.<br>
<br>
 According one 
web site devoted to skiing andsnowboarding in France, under current law, 
individuals who wish to teach snowboarding in France must first be certified as 
ski instructors. Given the widespread acceptance of snowboarding today, we see 
this requirement--recently criticized by the European Union--as a case of 
protectionism. By imposing an additional requirement on would-be instructors, 
France limits the ability of instructors from Britain, Germany, and other 
countries to compete against French instructors.
<h3>Acceptability: Good or Bad?</h3> Over time, snowboarding has become 
accepted within the ski industry and the broader society. Yet for various 
reasons (none good, that we know of), a few snowboarders think that's a bad 
thing.<br>
<br>
From banning snowboarders altogether to wooing them with 
terrain parks, the attitudes of ski resorts have changed dramatically over 
time. Most ski areas are profit-seeking operations; the initial ban (and 
subsequent attempts to actually attract snowboarders) was and is motivated by 
the desire to prosper, financially. Seeing the increased interesting in riding, 
more and more areas opened up to snowboards. Snowboarding is increasingly 
important to the financial health of snow sports areas. During the 2003-2004 
season, for example, 30 percent of all lift tickets at resorts were sold to 
snowboarders.<br>
<br>
Snowboarding made it &quot;big&quot; in media during the 
1990s, as a backdrop to television commercials. It also gained entrance into 
that most commercial of sporting events, the Olympics. Reflecting the rebel 
portion of snowboarding's past, some snowboarders refused to participate in the 
games, fearing that they would further erode what they saw as the spirit of the 
sport. Most riders, however, rejected this concern, and rightfully so.<br>
<br>

 In short, snowboarding has gone from the countercultural lifestyle of a few to 
something much bigger.The Snowboard Journal captured the situation well: 
&quot;With over 7 million snowboarders in the United States alone, it has 
become much more than a lifestyle for a dedicated core of riders. Snowboarding 
not only has evolved into a legitimate sport, it also is a hobby for countless 
people throughout the world.&#133; Such rapid growth of acceptance can be 
interpreted as either a boon or a bane to snowboarding, depending on one&#146;s 
point of view. The purists claim the culture is being diluted and commodified 
by corporations, while most others insist that the gains instilled by this 
surge in popularity can only mean bigger and better things for snowboarding in 
every regard. In effect, snowboarding is going through growing pains, learning 
how to deal with all the attention without losing sight of what drove most of 
us to slide sideways down a mountain in the first place: sharing good times 
with good friends, absolutely no rules except having fun.&quot;
<h3>Interacting with Skiers</h3> While snowboarding is widely accepted, you 
can still do a few things to promote harmonious use of the mountains. Call it 
wisdom through age or old-fashioned personal maturity, but Grays on Trays can 
play a role in promoting multiple uses of the slopes.<br>
<br>
<b>Take the 
compliment, and issue the invitation.</b> <br>
 If your skiing friends applaud 
you for your courage at taking up a new sport, accept the compliment, and 
invite them to take a lesson.<br>
<br>
<b>Acknowledge skier grievances.</b> <br>
 If skiers grumble about snowboarders, recognize that they have legitimate 
concerns, but point out that as snowboarding &quot;grows up,&quot; its manners 
improve.<br>
<br>
<b>Remind skiers of business realities.</b> <br>
Remind 
skiers that for-profit businesses do what they think will appeal to customers. 
In this case, it means making room for snowboarders. It's not a question of 
values or aesthetics, but simply business. Most people will recognize that.<br>

<br><b>Demonstrate on-slope manners.</b> <br>
 Practice a little kindness on 
the slopes. If a skier falls and suffers a &quot;yard sale&quot; the equipment 
goes scattered far away), stop and pick up a ski or pole, if you are within a 
location that allows you to do this. Take special care to stay far away from 
beginning skiers. Look for other ways to show consideration.<br>
<br>
<b>
Explain how snowboarding works.</b> <br>
 Sometimes sharing how snowboarding 
works can help weaken hostility to riding. Some skiers, for example, may 
complain that riders are always sitting down. &quot;Are they just lazy?&quot;
<br><br>
It is easy to forget that when it comes to stopping, skiers have it 
easy. Balancing while in a stopped position is easier on two boards rather than 
one. Skiers also have poles available as a balance aid. Given those facts, 
then, riders are not lazy.<br>
<br>
If you explain this, a skier might better 
understand what's going on, if not necessarily approve. (It would help if 
riders, and skiers, would do their resting at the edge of trails.)<br>
<br>
<b>
Practice tighter turns.</b><br>
 Even though you should, by the responsibility 
code of the mountain, have the right of way if you are further downhill than 
someone else, some skiers get nervous seeing snowboarders riding from one far 
side of the trail to the other.<br>
<br>
Skilled skiers should have no problem 
dealing with this kind of behavior, but even they can be upset by it.<br>
<br>

Here's one way to address this objection: next time you stop on the mountain 
near a group of skiers, be the first one to resume heading down the hill. If 
your skill and setup, as well as the terrain permits, make tight turns down the 
fall line. The gentle back-and-forth as you shift from heelside to toeside, and 
back, will give the skiers a chance to see how graceful riding on a board can 
be.<br>
<br>
<b>Live in peace.</b> <br>
Roughly 2,000 years ago, St. Paul told 
the early Christians &quot;If it be possible, as much as lieth in you, live 
peaceably with all men.&quot; (Romans 12:18). Use the same logic today.<br>
<br>
Some skiers will remain hostile no matter what you do or say. If you come 
across such people, leave them alone. But otherwise, gently share your 
enthusiasm and you'll be doing your part to promote the widest possible 
enjoyment of the slopes.
<h3>How Riding is Like Skiing</h3> Regardless of what equipment you use, 
skiers and riders share similarities:
<ul> 
<li>Enjoying the outdoors, making the most of winter. </li> 
<li>Scanning the terrain as you go, looking for places to avoid--or seek out. 
</li> 
<li>Skillful use of both forms of equipment involves linking turns. </li> 
<li>Using the edges is critical. </li> 
<li>So is being aware of and maintaining balance. </li> 
<li>In both activities, a person alternates between being parallel to the fall 
line, perpendicular to it, and everywhere in between.</li> </ul>
