Snowboading Arlberg, Austria<br>
</b><br>
<br>
<i>by </i><i>Marco Toniolo</i><i>
<br> </i><br>
 The Arlberg is a small region nestled between the Tyrol and 
Voralberg, seemingly made for skiing. The slopes are steep but never 
excessively so, every year there is plenty of snow, and the hospitality is 
memorable. Two villages, Lech and Z&uuml;rs. are situated close to famous St. 
Anton and offer fabulous freeriding itineraries that will make you want to 
return to this corner of Austria. Often. One liftpass covers the entire area 
and the two villages are connected by ski lifts, unlike St. Anton which is 
reached by bus.<br>
<br>
<br>
<i>&quot;...not many people visit this area at 
this time of year ... resulting in many of the slopes remaining virgin.&quot;
</i><br>

2. Omeshorn &nbsp;&nbsp; Very difficult <br>

<br>
<br>
 The best time of 
year for skiing and snowboarding is definitely from the start of December to 
late January, when temperatures are low, guaranteeing fresh powder snow for 
many days. In addition, not many people visit this area at this time of year 
(apart from the Christmas period) resulting in many of the slopes remaining 
virgin.<br>
<br>
 Given the altitude (never beneath 1500m) it is possible to 
ski here until late April. Lift passes are cheaper in mid-April. Don't miss out 
on the &quot;firn&quot; . This forms when snow freezes early in the morning and 
then transforms. True experts time their descents perfectly for that moment 
when the hardpack transforms into soft snow, before eventually transforming 
into slush.<br>
<i><br>
</i>The following itineraries are for advanced skiers 
and only to be undertaken in stable snow conditions. Do not be fooled by the 
ski lifts nearby: all itineraries require experience and knowledge of how to 
move on steep, avalanche prone terrain.<br>
<br>
 Always take a rescue beacon, 
shovel and probe. If you are unsure about your avalanche awareness hire a 
Mountain Guide. At this point, there's nothing stopping you enjoying the 
fantastic off-piste<i>.</i><br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Difficulty<br>
</b>The itineraries 
can only be skied in good, stable snow conditions by advanced riders.<br>
 
Highly recommended is a rescue beacon and shovel. <br>
<br>
<b>Getting there<br>
</b><b>By car: </b>thanks to its central position Z&uuml;rs can be easily 
reached from Germany, Switzerland and Italy.<br>
<br>
<b>Train: </b>The 
Eurocity trains stop at St. Anton. Continue by bus to Z&uuml;rs<br>
<br>
<b>
Villages nearby:</b>Kl&ouml;sterle (ideal for cheap accommodation), St. Anton
