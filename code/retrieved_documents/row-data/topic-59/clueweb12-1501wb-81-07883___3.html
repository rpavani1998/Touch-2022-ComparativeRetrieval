<h1> New to Skiing &amp; Snowboarding </h1> 
<p>Welcome to Mount Washington and your entry to the exciting new world of 
snow sports! Don&rsquo;t be scared- everybody was a beginner at some time. Just 
remember it&rsquo;s never too late to learn. Whether it&rsquo;s to spend more 
time with your family, expand your active lifestyle, hang out with your friends 
or just to spend some time above the clouds, the possibilities are endless. 
With the following tips we will help you to create the best skiing or 
snowboarding experience possible.</p> 
<h4><strong>SKIING OR SNOWBOARDING</strong></h4> 
<p>Everyone has their own opinion on which they like better, skiing or 
snowboarding. However ultimately the decision is yours to make. Later on you 
may decide to do both as many of us do. Just remember you can always change 
your mind! To start choose something that you think you will be comfortable 
with, remember this is all about having fun. Once you choose you can create 
your plan of attack.</p> 
<h4><strong>GET UP AND GEAR UP!</strong></h4> 
<p>Wake up and get excited! Make sure you drink some fluids and get some 
breakfast. Your body will need the energy later. Do some stretches to loosen up 
your back and leg muscles. Skiing and snowboarding is going to make you use 
muscles you never knew you had. RELAX this is not work or school. It&rsquo;s 
all about having fun and learning something new.<br>
 Listen to the weather 
forecast but remember Mount Washington weather can change rapidly. Be prepared 
for any conditions. If you have time organize your gear the night before. When 
you get dressed think layers. Proper layering starts with good thermals that 
keep you warm and wick away moisture. Try to avoid cotton. Next we suggest a 
lightweight, breathable fleece to help keep you warm and dry. Best part is, if 
it gets to warm you can always ditch it. Wear a jacket and pants that are both 
wind and water resistant this will not only make your day more enjoyable but 
also help you to focus on all the important things like perfecting those turns 
on your skis and boards. Whether it's sunny or snowing we always suggest you 
have something on your eyes. Goggles work best as they can protect your eyes in 
all conditions. If you missing something stop by the<strong><em>Express Rentals 
Centre</em></strong> in the Bradley Centre<br>
 If you feel like you are 
missing a few of these things in your wardrobe or you just plain forgot them at 
home. Visit<strong><em>Altitude Sport and Gift</em></strong> located in the 
main lodge. There you can get suited up in all the latest trends and 
necessities for your first day on the hill.<br>
 Lastly, don&rsquo;t forget to 
wear a helmet. Not only will it keep your head warm but it will also keep it 
protected. Helmets are included in all Discover ski, snowboard and kids 
programs.</p> 
<h4><strong>RENTALS</strong></h4> 
<p>Open at 8am daily, the <strong><em>Express Rentals Centre</em></strong> in 
the Bradley Centre is located just below the main lodge. Here our rentals 
technicians will get you suited up in the best rental equipment designed by
<strong><em> Rossignol </em></strong>and <strong><em>Burton</em></strong> 
specifically for beginners. Try to be early as the Bradley Centre can get quite 
busy especially on weekends and holidays. You can save yourself some time and 
pick up your rentals at 3pm the night before at no extra charge that way you 
can hit the slopes first thing in the morning.<br>
 When filling out your 
rentals forms you will be asked your height, weight and shoe size. This 
information is used to select the appropriate gear and fit for your needs. 
Don&rsquo;t worry no one is judging anything.<br>
 When trying on boots 
remember comfortable feet are key. That means only one pair of socks. Wearing 
more pairs will not keep your feet any warmer and can cause pressure points in 
your boots which can become very uncomfortable throughout the day.<br>
 If you 
are snowboarding you will be asked if you are left foot forward or right foot 
forward. If you have no idea, consider how you would slide across the floor. 
Whichever foot is in front will decide if you are left or right foot forward. 
If you have any questions or concerns about the gear and how it should fit, our 
friendly rentals technicians will be happy to help you.</p> 
<h4><strong>LESSONS</strong></h4> 
<p>A good lesson can take you from an alright day on the hill to an amazing 
one!<strong><em>Mount Washington Snow School</em></strong> has many different 
lesson options to suit your individual needs. Private lessons are an excellent 
way to kick start your day with 2 hrs of one on one instruction and feedback. 
We also offer Discover skiing and snowboarding packages which include rentals, 
a Easy Acres lift ticket and a 2 hr beginner group lesson. We keep our class 
sizes small to ensure quality lessons. Ask about our Learn to Turn program new 
for the 2010-2011 season!</p> 
<p>When it's time to meet for your lesson, don&rsquo;t be shy. Get to know 
your instructor and fill him/her in on anything that you think may be 
important. Never tried it, tried it once with a friend, had a previous knee 
injury, afraid of the chairlifts, etc. This is all important information that 
will help your instructor create a better experience for you. Also get to know 
the other people in your lesson. Chances are they might be a little nervous 
too. If you&rsquo;re getting tired, rest for a minute and watch and learn. You 
can learn a lot from watching other beginners find their balance.</p> <br>
