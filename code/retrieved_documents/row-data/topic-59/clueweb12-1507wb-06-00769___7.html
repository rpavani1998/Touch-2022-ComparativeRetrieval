<p></p> 
<p>Regardless of its small territory the landscape of Bulgaria is highly 
varied. Almost 30% of its territory is occupied by mountain areas of different 
origin. About 40% of it are hilly areas of altitude between 300 and 600m above 
the sea level. The average annual temperatures vary within the range from 
-3&deg;C to 14&deg;C.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>There is a perfect combination of warm sea and high snowy mountains, 
suitable both for skiing and winter tourism. There are 3 modern winter resorts 
in Bulgaria. Bovorats, Bansko and Pamporova. Each of them is situated in a 
different mountain region, but all the resorts offer everything you need to 
spend a great winter vacation.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>There are well designed ski runs, for beginners or advanced skiers, 
complying with international standards, as well as ski tracks for top skiing 
championships, cross-country skiing, biathlon and ski jumps. Excellent ski 
schools are available in each resort. Lifts, drags, and emergency patrols are 
available too.</p>

<h2>BULGARIAN SKI RESORTS</h2> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Borovets</li> 
<li>Bansko</li> 
<li>Pamporova</li> </ul> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<h3>Bovorats</h3> 
<p>Dating from 1896, the oldest Bulgarian winter resort is Borovets. Borovets 
is the largest and most modern resort in Bulgaria. It is situated on the 
northern slopes of the Mousala ridge in the eastern part of Rila. Nestled in 
pine woods 1390 meters above the sea level (with highest pistes at 2600 m)makes 
it a perfect place for relax and recreation. The winter in the resort is quite 
mild and has a lot of snow! The average temperature during the coldest month is 
January with the average temperature reaching 4.8&ordm;C. Most commonly the 
slopes have snow cover from mid December till April. The air in is clear and 
free of any pollutants.<br>
<br>
 Borovets is easily accessible, only 12k along 
a first class road connects it with Samokov and Sofia, the Bulgarian capital is 
just 72k away. There are regular bus services running every 30 mins.<br>
<br>
 
The excellent skiing conditions attract thousands of winter sports lovers not 
only from Bulgaria but from many other countries. There are various pistes 
which vary in difficulty and length and are grouped into three regions: 
Sitnqkovo &ndash; Martinovi Baraki &ndash;7 pistes; Markudjik- 4 pistes and 
Qstrebec- 3 pistes. The pistes on Qstrebets are the best and many competitions 
are held there. Bovorats has twice hosted World Cup competitions in Alpine 
skiing. Its biathlon track is one of the best in Europe.</p> 
<p><br>
 Borovets is an alpine resort type and provides excellent conditions 
for snow sports during the winter: skiing, night- skiing, snowboarding, 
cross-country skiing, ski jumps and biathlon, skidoo, ice-skating etc. There 
are available ski runs for beginners, intermediates and advanced skiers, 
designed with international markings and multilingual signs.</p> 
<p>&nbsp; </p> 
<h3>Bansko</h3> 
<p>Bansko is situated nearby the river Glazane on the north eastern slopes of 
Pirin, right below the highest part of the mountain. It is just 160k away from 
the capital Sofia and 6k away from Razlog. Bansko has developed into 
Bulgaria&rsquo;s favourite ski &amp; snowboard destination, thanks to the 
excellent facilities combined with the unique architecture and historical 
significance.</p> 
<p>During the recent years a multi-million euro investment in a brand new 
skiing area has been made. Bansko has the best snow record and the longest ski 
season (15 Dec - 15 May) of all Bulgarian ski resorts. This is helped by 44 
Technoalpine snow cannons which cover most of the slopes and make the ski 
season last longer.</p> 
<p>The town of Bansko is located at 925m above sea level, and its skiing area 
is at 2000-2600m, the highest peak in the area being Vihren at 2914m. The ski 
pistes are located in two main ski centres, CHALIN VALOG and SHILIGARNIKA. They 
are approximately 10k above the town on the northern slopes of Pirin, and are 
easily accessible with a trip of approx 25 mins on the gondola lift from the 
town. The total length of the marked pistes is 65k. Although the resort has 
been famous for no more than 10 years it has a lot to offer visitors. The 
resort has excellent snow conditions with great snow cover from December till 
May.</p> 
<p>The lifts and pistes operator are excellent with an eight seat Gondola 
cable car, five 4 seat lifts, one 3-seat lift, 7 drags and 10 baby drags. The 
total length of the wire equipment in the resort is 26 kilometers.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<h3>Pamporova</h3> 
<p>Pamporovo has an exclusive climate featuring a soft winter with around 120 
sunny days during the skiing period. This is a result of the influence of The 
Aegean Sea and the skiing season starts from mid December to mid April. The 
average air temperature is - 3 &deg; C. The gentle profile of the mountain with 
its rounded slopes and summits makes Pamporovo particularly suitable for 
beginners. But there are also difficult ski runs like the Giant Slalom run 
which is an excellent run for the experts.</p> 
<p>All slopes are safe guarded and maintained in a very good condition. More 
than 100 qualified ski instructors fluent in English are here to teach both 
beginners and intermediate skiers and snowboarders. Ski rentals are available 
near the ski runs and the lift stations. The ski runs in Pamporovo come in 
various levels of difficulty. They are located between 1926m and 1450m above 
the sea level on the northern, eastern and western slopes of The Snejanka peak. 
All in all great off-piste skiing and snowboarding is available in this resort, 
however we recommend using a guide if planning to go off-piste.<br>
