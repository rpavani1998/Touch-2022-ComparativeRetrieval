<h2>Copper Mountain Terrain</h2> Copper has great skiing and riding for all 
ability levels with its naturally divided terrain. Starting from the west-side 
of the resort moving east the terrain gets increasingly more difficult, with 
expert terrain located above and in the back bowls. In addition, Copper&rsquo;s 
free snowcat rides to legendary Tucker Mountain are the essence of skiing and 
riding liberty: catching a free ride, choosing your own line and never wiping 
the smile off your face.
<p>The resort consists of not only an incredible mountain, but multiple 
villages, hundreds of buildings and a million other tangible, moving pieces. 
Copper is, and always has been, bigger than the tangible. Copper is about 
people. It&rsquo;s about spirit. It&rsquo;s about attitude, passion, heart, 
guest loyalty and financial strength. It&rsquo;s about a place that provides a 
true connection to nature, adventure, the mountain, the community and the 
mountain lifestyle, void of any pretense.</p>

a spring floor, fly-bed trampolines and indoor skateboard features. New this 
winter are Holiday Park and Pipe Camps, as well as the new youth season 
program, Park Rats. In the summer, week-long overnight camps are offered.</p>

<h2>What's New This Season at Copper Mountain</h2> Copper now can take you to 
the top twice as fast on the new Union Creek High speed Quad. Say so long to 
the HighPoint lift and hello to more runs. Enjoy those powder days a little bit 
more and forget about wasting time on the chair.
<p> Like nothing else in the world, Woodward at Copper is a year round ski and 
snowboard training camp dedicated to park and pipe progression, providing a 
safe and fun learning environment for all levels of park and pipe riders and 
skiers through established progressive training techniques. The 20,000 sq ft 
Woodward at Copper Barn gives campers access to Snowflex&reg; jumps, foam pits, 
a spring floor, trampolines and indoor skateboard features.</p> 
<p>You Deserve a Snow Day at Copper and to make sure of it, Copper will be 
enhancing snowmaking, free parking, plus more parking and an improved arrival 
experience at Union Creek for the 2011-2012 winter season. This focus on 
infrastructure enhancements will set the stage for future on-mountain 
improvements.</p>
