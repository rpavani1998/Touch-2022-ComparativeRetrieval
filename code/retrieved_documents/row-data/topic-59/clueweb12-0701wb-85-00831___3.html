Top 5 Skiing &amp; Snowboarding Injuries

<li>Risk Factors</li> 
<li>Prevention Tips</li> </ul> 
<p> Based on research evidence, the biggest risk factors associated with 
skiing and snowboarding injures are:</p> 
<ul> 
<li> Poorly adjusted bindings<br>
 Research evidence on skiing injuries, 
particularly injuries in children, suggests that the biggest single factor 
related to injury is the condition of ski bindings. There is a significantly 
higher risk of injury to the legs in particular where bindings have not been 
properly adjusted.<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> Use of Rented Equipment<br>
 Some researchers have suggested that the use 
of rented skis, boots and bindings, that are not well-adjusted to the 
individual could increase the risk of injuries. Children often use rented 
equipment and this may be another factor that contributes to an increased risk 
of injury in this group.<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> Lack of ski lessons <br>
 The research on the relationship between ski 
lessons and injury is a little more equivocal, but some studies have suggested 
that there is an increased injury risk in skiers who haven't had formal 
lessons. Common sense would suggest that formal learning was a good idea for 
novice skiers, to allow them to acquire a degree of skiing skill. However there 
is a counter argument that those who gain skills rapidly can become 
overconfident and therefore attempt to descend difficult runs that increase the 
risk of injuries.<br>
<br>
</li> 
<li> Skill Level <br>
 Researchers have found that skiers with less skill or 
experience have a higher incidence of injury compared with more experienced 
skiers. The injury rate for novice skiers has been reported to be as high as 9 
or 10 times that of advanced level skiers. It is difficult to discern whether 
the risk is increased due to a lack of skill or a lack of experience, although 
one study suggested that more experienced skiers got less injuries even if 
their technical skills were not that advanced. It would appear experience 
teaches skiers to avoid situations where the injury risk is high.</li> </ul>
