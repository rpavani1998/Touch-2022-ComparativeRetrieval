</li> </ul> One of Switzerland's classic ski areas, 
Adelboden has a long history of winter sports dating back to the start of the 
last century. The picturesque resort sits below one of Switzerland's largest 
ski areas, which links the local slopes with those of neighbouring Lenk.<br>

<br> Adelboden is popular with skiers of all standards and has plenty of 
leisure facilities for non-skiers too. Although there's skiing for all 
abilities here, the resort has built a particular reputation as a serious ski 
destination. It is firmly fixed in the FIS Ski World Cup calendar, with the 
giant slalom race on Chuenisb&auml;rgli one of the classic ski events, annually 
drawing well over 20,000 spectators to witness the action live. 
<ul> 
<li> 
<h2>Skiing for Beginners+</h2>  The ski school offers lessons from Monday to 
Friday with sessions lasting about three hours. The ski school operates a bus 
and lessons begin at the tourist centre. Tickets (which are best purchased the 
day before) include use of special beginner lifts so you do not need to 
purchase a full area lift ticket from day one if you are a complete beginner. 
</li> 
<li> 
<h2>Intermediate Skiing+</h2>  With more than 20 high speed chair lifts, 
gondolas and cable cars it's easy to get around Adelboden's huge ski area which 
stretches for more than 10km (six miles) as the crow flies to Lenk, with runs 
up to seven kilometres (four and a half miles) long. Night time skiing on 
Chuenisb&auml;rgli takes place every Friday in February and is free for 
multi-day lift ticket holders. The pistes are open from 7pm to 9.45pm. </li> 
<li> 
<h2>Advanced+</h2>  With 14 black runs covering more than 20km (13 miles) of 
piste, Adelboden has well above average attractions for the advanced skier. 
These are multiplied by numerous off-piste routes available to be tackled with 
a local mountain guide.<br>
<br>
 The Alpine School Adelboden runs tour weeks 
of the high elevation, Engstligenalp which enjoys snow from December to 
mid-May. It is the largest high plateau in the western Swiss Alps. To the North 
is the Fitzer mountain, to the West the Ammerten peak, to the South West the 
Wildstrubel dominates and in the North East lies the Aetelen Ridge. 
Fully-qualified mountain guides explain how to assess the avalanche situation, 
operate the avalanche rescue device, improve ski technique and how to measure 
the mountain gradient. Having climbed to the top of one of the surrounding 
mountains, you can enjoy the magnificent view before skiing back through deep 
snow to Engstligenalp. </li> 
<li> 
<h2>Snowboarding at Adelboden+</h2>  Adelboden always has a lot of major 
snowboarding events each winter, centred on the resort's highly regarded Gran 
Masta Park. Located in the Hahnenmoos sector, the park offers different lines 
with rails and jumps designed for all ability levels from beginners to experts. 
The park is well maintained by a dedicated team led by D&auml;nu Kaufmann and 
has recently had local toilets and a new chill out zone added. The Official 
Snowboard School Adelboden offers &quot;sampler&quot; courses, private and 
group tuition at all levels. It was the first boarding-only school in the Swiss 
canton of Bern to open, back in 1992. The school is located next to Crazy 
Sports which rents out all required gear. </li> 
<li> 
<h2>Other Activities And Facilities at Adelboden+</h2>  Dog sledding is 
available with dog driver Markus R&ouml;thlisberger who has set up winter home 
with his four-legged friends on Engstligenalp.<br>
<br>
 From the end of 
December to the end of February, a two kilometre long cross country ski trail 
in Boden (near Adelboden) is floodlit from 6.30pm to 9.30pm every Monday and 
Wednesday. The route is perfect for beginners and the Snow Sports School 
Adelboden organises private lessons on request. Other activities include 
paragliding, sleigh rides, snowshoeing and curling.<br>
<br>
 The main indoor 
leisure centre is the sports centre at neighbouring Frutigen. This has a 25 
metre long main pool for swimmers, a large multi-function pool, a children's 
fun pool with a small slide and a whirlpool for 12 people, with a relaxation 
room where people have a beautiful view over the mountains. Frutigen is also 
home to an indoor horse riding centre. </li> 
<li> 
<h2>Apres Ski And Dining Out+</h2>  The Alte Taverne has built a long standing 
reputation for top bands in a cosy, informal venue. Here you will find 
everything from the little known genre of Bernese Hip-Hop group to pop hits 
parties and rock performers. The Berna Bar in the Hotel Bernerhof is another 
popular choice and the ARTE bar is an interesting venue combining works of art 
with a bar serving rum, whiskies, port and fine wines, to provide an experience 
of artistic ambience.<br>
<br>
 Adelboden's restaurants offer a choice of 
dining from fast food to gourmet, The Bodenhuettli is a homely restaurant where 
you can enjoy fresh &quot;wood oven&quot; pizzas. The Baren serves local and 
international dishes in a cosy dining lounge and has a choice of 160 wines in 
their cellar to choose from to accompany your meal. The Beau Site has a rustic 
dining area with gourmet lounge. </li> 
<li> 
<h2>Ski Holidays in Adelboden suitable for Families+</h2>  The village of cosy 
chalet style buildings is particularly popular with families - indeed Adelboden 
has won the accolade &quot;Families Welcome&quot; from the Swiss Tourist Board 
for its children-friendly infrastructure and range of activities for its 
younger guests. The award results from many initiatives across the resort, but 
some of the more unique include bedtime stories read on Monday nights, family 
sledging evenings and even bakery for children aged six and older in the 
Haueter bakery on Wednesday afternoons.<br>
<br>
 There is no non-ski nursery 
for babies but the children's club run by the Swiss Snowsports School Adelboden 
is suitable for all children from three to five years old. Especially popular 
are the children's races and of course the children's parties. Children aged 
from four years upwards are welcome to join the day or week long ski classes 
organised by the school. </li> </ul>
