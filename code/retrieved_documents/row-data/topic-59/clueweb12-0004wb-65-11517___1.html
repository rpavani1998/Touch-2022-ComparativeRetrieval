<li>cold exposure</li> </ul>  Whether you like to ski or snowboard (or one of 
the dozens of other types of gravity-related snow transport devices) there's 
always a chance of injury. Overall, less than 4 injuries happen for every 1,000 
days of skiing or snowboarding, which isn't bad. Of course, some of those 
injuries are pretty major -- and some are even life-threatening. 
<h2>1. Knee Sprains</h2> (c) Matt Gibson <br>
 Twisting and turning on big 
sticks strapped to your feet has a way of putting a bit of strain on anyone's 
knees. Knees are only supposed to bend in one direction, and only go a certain 
distance at that. Knee Sprains <br>

<h2>2. Broken Wrists</h2> (c) Adam Pretty/Getty Images <br>
 Of course, if you 
strap both legs to the same board and fall over, the natural tendency is to put 
a hand down. How to Treat a Broken Wrist <br>

<h2>3. Broken Legs</h2> (c) Peter Dutton <br>
 Whether you like two sticks or 
one, the things are strapped to your legs. Bones can only handle so much. How 
to Treat a Broken Leg <br>

<h2>4. Facial Injuries</h2> (c) Peter Dutton <br>
 Believe it or not, most 
facial injuries in skiing are from getting smacked by the T-bar. Whether it's a 
nosebleed or a cut, it's all fun and games until somebody loses an eye. Facial 
Injuries <br>

<h2>5. Shoulder Dislocations</h2> (c) Neil Rickards <br>
 Supposedly, each 
time you do this it gets easier. I wouldn't want to try. Shoulder Dislocations 
<br> 
<h2>6. Ankle Sprains</h2> (c) Ezra Shaw/Getty Images <br>
 Get bindings that 
let go. Ankle sprains don't help you get the most of that season ticket. How to 
Treat a Sprain <br>

<h2>7. Spinal Injuries</h2> (c) Doug Pensinger/Getty Images <br>
 Spinal 
injuries are very rare on the slopes, but still account for 4-10% of all 
fatalities. How to Treat a Suspected Cervical Spine Injury <br>

<h2>8. Sunburns</h2> (c) Mark Goble <br>
 Not considered specifically a 
skier's injury, but there's nothing like a bunch of white snow to reflect 
sunshine all over your face. How to Treat a Sunburn <br>

<h2>9. Hypothermia</h2> (c) betty x1138 <br>
 Gonna get lost out of bounds? 
Stay warm. How to Treat Hypothermia <br>

<h2>10. Head Injuries</h2> (c) sookie <br>
 Kids clobber their noggins more 
than any other group, and probably would benefit from wearing helmets. Powder 
is soft, but trees aren't too forgiving. How to Treat a Head Injury <br>
