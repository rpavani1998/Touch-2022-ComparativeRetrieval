 Lessons and Rentals 
<h1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - <strong>The Rental Process and How Equipment Should 
Fit</strong> View Details</h1>  Before you can rent your equipment we will need 
you to fill out a rental form. These are located at the entryway to the ski 
rental shop. Fill them out before you approach the rental desk. You will need 
to know the age, height, weight, and shoe size for each person renting 
equipment. If you are renting skis you will need to know the Skier Type, which 
can be found by viewing the Skier Ability Chart. Skier Ability Charts are 
posted in the Rental Shop. If you are renting a snowboard you will need to know 
if the person rides with their left or right foot forward (the rental techs can 
help you determine this if you are unsure). Picture ID will be required.<br>

<br> Once you have paid the cashier they will validate your rental form, which 
you will hand to the next available technician as you proceed into the boot 
fitting area. The technician will give you a pair of boots to try on. Some 
things to remember about boot fit:<br>

<ul> <br>

<li>Boots are supposed to fit like a firm handshake, and your toes are 
supposed to touch the front of boot when you stand up. However, your toes 
should not feel jammed into the front of the boot.<br>
</li> 
<li>One pair of light- to medium-weight ski specific wool socks will keep you 
warmer than three pairs of cotton, orange hunting socks.<br>
</li> </ul> <br>
 
From there, you will follow the line to get your skis and poles or snowboard. A 
rental technician will assist you in selecting the correct equipment for your 
height.<br>

<h1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - <strong>How do I sign up for a lesson and get rental 
equipment?</strong> View Details</h1>  Lesson information for Beginners, Group 
Lessons, Private Lessons, and Multi-Week Lesson Packages can be found by 
clicking on the appropriate link. Advance reservations are recommended for all 
lesson programs. If you don't sign up in advance we may not be able to 
accommodate you when you arrive. You can also call in your lesson request at 
509.935.6649 ext. 610.<br>
<br>
 If its your first time skiing or snowboarding 
or if you are enrolling children in our kids' ski programs, your first stop 
should be the ski school desk, not the lift-ticket window or the rental shop. 
At the ski school desk, in the lower level of the lodge, you can sign up and 
pay for your lessons, your lift ticket, and rental all in one transaction. (If 
you go to the lift ticket window first and then need to enroll in a lesson, 
you'll end up waiting in two lines versus one.)<br>
<br>
 You can find lift, 
rental and lesson rates on our website at ski49n.com or in our 49&deg;N 
brochure. At the ski school desk, you will complete a lesson 
registration/liability release and equipment rental form if you are renting. It 
is best to complete these forms before you reach the cashier.<br>
<br>
 After 
completing your transaction at the ski school desk, you may proceed to the 
rental shop. To learn more about the rental process and how equipment should 
fit please follow this link, or scroll down to the next question.<br>
<br>
 
After you have been properly fitted for your equipment, you should proceed to 
the lesson meeting area designated by your ski school desk cashier. Make sure 
you're clear on its location before you leave the desk, otherwise, a rental 
technician should be able to help you find your way.<br>
<br>
 Remember to 
allow an hour for this process so you can make it to your lesson on time.<br>

<h1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - <strong>Teaching Children to Ski</strong> View Details
</h1>  Snowboard lessons for children usually start at about age 7. However, 
lessons are available for younger children as well. Advance reservations are 
highly recommended for all lesson and daycare programs.<br>
<br>
 If you're 
registering children for their first ski lesson its important to set realistic 
expectations. Children under the age of 5 often remain on the beginner slope 
for most, If not all, of their first day. Depending on their individual muscle 
control and development, skiing and snowboarding can be difficult for them to 
master in their first days. If your child is under the age of 5, its important 
to recognize that walking in their ski boots and making straight glides are big 
accomplishments.<br>
<br>
 Most children under the age of 5 are not yet capable 
of the necessary motor skills required to achieve speed control and braking 
movement patterns. We only offer private lessons for children under age 5. 
Children age 5 - 11 can enroll into group lessons, but may also take private 
lessons. The most important thing to remember is that their first taste of 
skiing needs to be positive, non-threatening and fun.<br>
<br>

<br> 
<h1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - <strong>Why shouldn't I let my friends teach me how 
to ski/ride?</strong> View Details</h1>  As good a skier as your friend may be, 
it's best to let them ski their favorite runs while you enroll in a lesson from 
a Professional Ski or Snowboard Instructor. Our instructors are extensively 
trained, and their job is to teach newcomers the fundamentals of skiing and 
boarding %u2014 allowing you to build a strong foundation. A lesson from a 
Professional Instructor ensures that you'll learn the proper methods of the 
sport in a time-proven progression.<br>
<br>
 We often see skiers and boarders 
trying to take newcomers on terrain that they are not ready for.<br>
<br>
 
Though lessons are an additional expense, the cost is well worth avoiding the 
strain on your friendship. To help reduce cost you can purchase your lesson, 
ski pass, and rental equipment in a package. Doing so reduces the overall cost 
of your day.<br>
<br>
 Don't expect too much from yourself after just one 
lesson. It may take two, three - maybe four lessons to have a solid grasp of 
the sport. But you know what? The amount of enjoyment you get out of a sport is 
directly related to your proficiency. After a few lessons you'll be enjoying a 
wider range of our winter slopes. We guarantee it.<br>

<br>  Clothing and Equipment 
<h1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - <strong>Are Snowboard Leashes Required?</strong> View 
Details</h1>  Your Responsibility Code states,&quot;Always use devices to help 
prevent runaway equipment&quot;. State law enforces this code (RCW 79A.45.030). 
We are not able to allow you to board a chair lift without the proper devices 
to prevent runaway equipment.<br>
 Skis have brakes built into the binding 
system to prevent runaway equipment, but snowboards do not. This is why 
snowboards must have a safety leash that attaches to its user, both while they 
are on the lift and riding. Boarders also must attach a leash to their body 
while hiking with their board. This prevents a run-away board in the event they 
should fall and drop their snowboard.<br>
 Imagine a snowboard that gets 
dropped in the Terrain Park and speeds toward the lift line. Such and event can 
cause serious injury or death. You may also be surprised at how many expensive 
boards we find in bushes, far from the edge of any runs, when the snow melts in 
spring.<br>
 There is no excuse to not having a leash. Many styles of leashes 
can be found at your local board shop and also in our Alpine Shop in the lodge. 
Protect your equipment, and protect each other. <br>
<br>

<h1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - <strong>Do I need to wear a helmet?</strong> View 
Details</h1>  Properly using a helmet can reduce the risk of serious head 
injuries. Helmets do have their limits and users need to be aware of them. 
However, a helmet can make a difference in reducing or preventing injury, and 
many skiers and snowboarders today are choosing to wear them. Helmets are 
designed to reduce the severity of head injuries, but they are most effective 
at providing protection from a direct blow to the head at speeds of 12 mph or 
slower. Keep in mind, if you lose control and hit a tree, an object, or another 
skier at moderate or high speed, a helmet may not prevent or reduce a serious 
injury. Its important that the user doesn't think that they can take more risks 
because they're wearing a helmet and therefore will be more protected. This is 
known as a false sense of security. The user, whether wearing a helmet or not, 
should always ski responsibly and within their ability. To learn more about 
helmet safety, check outLids on Kids, by following this link. <br>
<br>
<br>

<br> <br>
<br>

<h1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - <strong>What should I wear?</strong> View Details</h1>
 The key to keeping comfortable throughout your day is dressing in layers and 
wearing the right fabrics. Use fabrics made of wool, polyester, polypropylene 
or other synthetic materials. Avoid cotton as it looses its insulating 
properties when it becomes wet.<br>
<br>
 Feel free to bring an extra change of 
clothes; especially hats, gloves, and socks. Having a fresh set for after lunch 
can prolong your day, and help you further enjoy your mountain experience. 
There are coin operated lockers available in the lodge.<br>
<br>
 There are 
three layers you will need to consider for both top and bottom; the wicking 
layer, insulation layer, and the shell layer. Before heading up to the mountain 
you should also be prepared to properly equip your feet, hands, head, eyes, and 
skin.<br>
<br>
<i>Wicking Layer</i> <br>
 The first layer you want to put on is 
the wicking layer. %u2018Wicking%u2019 fabrics move sweat away from your skin 
to the outer surface of the fabric, where it evaporates. These fabrics keep 
your skin dry, and therefore warmer. Wicking fabrics include synthetics, such 
as polypropylene.<br>
<br>
<i>Insulating Layer</i> <br>
 The next layer should 
act as an insulator in keeping your body warm. Fabrics such as fleece, wool, 
and down or other synthetic materials are good choices for your insulating 
layer. Once again, avoid cotton. Many winter coats and snow pants include an 
insulating layer, but we recommend that you bring an extra layer in case you 
need additional warmth.<br>
<br>
<i>Shell Layer</i> <br>
 Your shell layer 
should protect you, and your inside layers, from becoming wet. Coats/jackets 
and snow pants that are waterproof and breathable provide protection from 
wetness on the outside, while allowing moisture from the inside to escape. 
Fabrics such as Gore-Tex provide this waterproof and breathable feature.<br>

<br> <i>Feet</i> <br>
 Ski and snowboarding boots already include insulation, 
so you will not need to put on several layers of socks to keep warm. We 
recommend wearing a thin pair of synthetic or wool socks. Avoid wearing thick 
socks or layering socks. This can cut off circulation to your feet, making them 
cold. Also, avoid tucking thick pants into your boots. Doing so can cause boots 
to fit incorrectly and cut off circulation, inhibiting performance and causing 
cold feet.<br>
<br>
<i>Hands</i> <br>
 You will be best off if you wear a pair 
of gloves or mittens that can provide you with good insulation and moisture 
protection. You will also find that mittens promote the exchange of heat 
between your fingers, keeping your hand warmer than if you were to wear gloves, 
which separate your fingers. Women generally have poorer circulation than men, 
making it harder to keep their hands and feet warm. Some people prefer using 
mittens to gloves.<br>
<br>
<i>Head</i> <br>
 About 80% of body heat is lost 
though the head, so hats are very important. Hats that cover your ears are 
recommended. You can also try a facemask to keep your face warm. Bringing a 
scarf or a neck warmer is a smart choice. Ear warmers are a convenient 
alternative to hats on warmer days, but they don%u2019t prevent the escape of 
body heat from the head.<br>
<br>
<i>Eyewear</i> <br>
 The final addition for 
your head would be UV and wind protection for your eyes. You can wear goggles 
or sunglasses, depending on the weather. Goggles will help keep your vision 
clear on snowy days. However, even if it isn%u2019t snowing, you should still 
wear sunglasses or goggles to protect your eyes from UV and wind. Goggles are 
recommended over sunglasses.<br>
<br>
<i>Sun Protection</i> <br>
 In addition 
to eye protection, we also recommend sunscreen to protect your skin. UV 
exposure is increased in a mountain environment due to altitude and reflection 
off of the snow. To learn more about the damaging affects of the Sun%u2019s UV 
rays, and how to protect yourself from them, check out Go Sun Smart at
http://www.gosunsmart.org/. <br>

 Safety 
<h1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - <strong>Tips for Safety and Mountain Etiquette
</strong> View Details</h1>  Ski Lift Safety <br>
 1. Do not bounce or swing in 
the chair you are riding. This can cause the chair you are in and those around 
you to derail. Riders may be knocked around or thrown from their chair, leading 
to serious injury. Also, avoid banging your skis together while on the lift. 
Not only can this cause the chairlifts to bounce, but you may also lose your 
equipment, resulting in an injury to someone below you. Engaging in such 
activities can result in revocation of your pass and possible legal action.<br>

 2. When entering any lift line, be sure that you are attentive and ready to 
follow the line and load properly. If you are skiing or boarding alone, check 
the line for single riders so you can be paired with other riders. This is a 
great way to meet people!<br>
 3. Remember to sit back all the way in your 
chair. Please refrain from leaning forward.<br>
 Tips for Hitting the Slopes 
<br> 4. Get in shape. Don't try to ski yourself into shape. You'll enjoy skiing 
more if you're physically fit.<br>
 5. Obtain proper equipment. Be sure to have 
your ski or snowboard bindings adjusted correctly at a local ski shop. If you 
don't have your own equipment, you may rent ski or snowboarding equipment from 
our ski rental shop. Please avoid borrowing equipment.<br>
 6. Obtain the 
appropriate ski/snowboard attire, and be prepared for changes in weather. To 
check out what you should wear, see &quot;What should I wear&quot; in the FAQs.
<br> Tips for on the Slopes <br>
 7. Take a lesson. You will improve the most 
when you receive some guidance. The best way to become a good skier or 
snowboarder is to take a lesson from a qualified instructor. Remember that even 
veteran skiers and riders can improve their skills and enjoy the mountain 
experience better with coachings from a professional. See how to sign up by 
following this link to our ski school web page.<br>
 8. The key to successful 
skiing/snowboarding is control. To have it, you must be aware of your 
technique, the terrain and the skiers/snowboarders around you. Be aware of the 
snow conditions and how they can change. As conditions change, different 
techniques are required. Be safe, and begin your run cautiously.<br>
 9. Ski or 
Ride with a buddy especially if using remote runs or glades where there is 
minimal traffic.<br>
 10. Be aware of the dangers of tree wells. Visit 
http://www.treewelldeepsnowsafety.com/ for detailed info on how to avoid and 
deal with entrapment in tree wells.<br>
 11. Remember, skiing and snowboarding 
require a mental and physical presence. Keep a positive attitude and have fun!
<br> 12. If you find yourself on a slope that exceeds your ability level, 
always leave your skis/snowboard on and side step down the slope.<br>
 13. The 
all-important warm-up run prepares you mentally and physically for the day 
ahead.<br>
 14. Drink plenty of water. Be careful not to become dehydrated. <br>
 15. Curb alcohol consumption. Skiing and snowboarding do not mix with alcohol 
or drugs.<br>
 16. Know your limits. Learn to ski and snowboard smoothly and in 
control. Stop before you become fatigued and, most of all have fun.<br>
 17. If 
you are tired, take a break. Many injuries occur when people overextend 
themselves. It is common for injuries to happen when people decide to take one 
last run.<br>
 18. Follow Your Responsibility Code,the seven safety rules of 
the slopes. <br>
<br>

<h1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - <strong>Terrain Park Safety</strong> View Details</h1>
 The terrain park offers challenging fun and excitement. Check out 
www.terrainparksafety.org for information on how to get the most out of your 
park experience safely for you and those around you. The three points to Smart 
Style are great guidelines.<br>
 Smart Style: <br>
<br>
 1. LOOK BEFORE YOU LEAP
<br> Scope around the jumps first, not over them. Know your landings are clear 
and clear yourself out of the landing area.<br>
 2. EASY STYLE IT <br>
 Start 
small and work your way up. (Inverted aerials not allowed).<br>
 3. RESPECT 
GETS RESPECT<br>
 From the lift line through the park. <br>
<br>

<h1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - <strong>Your Responsibility Code</strong> View Details
</h1>  Whether you ski, snowboard or telemark, you need to know &quot;the rules 
of the road&quot; so that you and everyone around you will have a safe, fun 
day. Nearly every professional ski and snowboard association, and most state 
laws, endorse your Responsibility Code. You'll see it posted at many resorts to 
remind you of the seven, simple safety guidelines of Your Responsibility Code:
<br> 1. Always stay in control, and be able to stop or avoid other people or 
objects.<br>
 2. People ahead of you have the right of way. It is your 
responsibility to avoid them.<br>
 3. You must not stop where you obstruct a 
trail, or are not visible from above.<br>
 4. Whenever starting downhill or 
merging into a trail, look uphill and yield to others.<br>
 5. Always use 
devices to help prevent runaway equipment.<br>
 6. Observe all posted signs and 
warnings. Keep off closed trails and out of closed areas.<br>
 7. Prior to 
using any lift, you must have the knowledge and ability to load, ride and 
unload safely. <br>
<br>

<h1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - <strong>Can I borrow equipment from my friends?
</strong> View Details</h1>  We discourage borrowing equipment for two reasons. 
The first reason is that many skis and bindings may be outdated, and no longer 
safe for you to use. In fact, rental technicians cannot adjust many old 
bindings because manufacturers will no longer indemnify the equipment.<br>
 The 
second reason against borrowing is that the equipment may not fit. Even if your 
friend is the same size as you, you should avoid borrowing their equipment. 
Sizing equipment depends on many other factors besides your physical 
similarities. Appropriate equipment should take into consideration skill level 
and preferred style. Ill-fitting boots, skis, boards, and poles can make you do 
more work than necessary, making play time on the hill feel more like a chore.
<br> While injuries are always possible, wearing outdated or ill-fitting or 
inappropriate equipment also increases your chance of injury. Buying or renting 
equipment that is suited for your size and abilities will enhance your comfort, 
and provide you with a safer and better experience on the mountain.<br>
 If you 
do use borrowed equipment, we recommend having the equipment thoroughly checked 
by your local equipment retailer and service shop prior to your trip to the 
slopes. They can ensure that it is in good working order, and properly adjusted 
for you. <br>
<br>

<h1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - <strong>Can I listen to music while skiing/riding?
</strong> View Details</h1>  Tuning into your favorite music while your 
cruising down the slopes can be a very enjoyable part of your mountain 
experience. But we don't recommend the use of personal sound systems. Listening 
to music may be gratifying, but it impairs your hearing and attention. You need 
your ears to hear others who are around you, including the areas you cannot 
always see. As an alternative we recommend spending some time in the Terrain 
Park, where music is often provided for skiers and boarders. <br>
<br>

<h1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - <strong>Are snow sports dangerous?</strong> View 
Details</h1>  Skiing and snowboarding are no more dangerous than other 
high-energy participation sports, and less so than some common activities. 
However, they are challenging and require physical skills that are only learned 
over time with practice.<br>
<br>
 The sport involves some inherent risks. For 
instance, you can't control the weather, or others on the mountain around you. 
You can, however, take steps to avoid accidents on the hill. The best way to 
avoid a collision is to follow the seven steps of Your Responsibility Code. 
This includes: staying in control, stopping in a safe place for you and others, 
and when starting downhill or merging, look uphill and yield. It is also 
important to obey signs designating slow zones and intersecting areas. Never 
ride in closed areas or out-of-bounds. This can lead to getting lost and 
incurring serious injury and/or costly search and rescue fees.<br>
<br>
 It is 
recommended that all skiers and snowboarders share the slopes and always show 
respect for others. Please feel free to view the full Responsibility Code,

<h1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - <strong>Equipment Use Policy</strong> View Details
</h1>  Ski Area - Ski Equipment Use Policy <br>
 November 22, 2011 <br>
<br>
 
When operated in accordance with the rules and regulations of the 49&deg; North 
Ski Area, ski equipment is allowed, with the exception of ski bikes (and any 
other prohibited equipment) which is prohibited at 49&deg; North Ski Area due 
to safety concerns.<br>
<br>
 A person who has a disability is allowed to 
utilize any specialized equipment that has been designed and manufactured 
solely for use by individuals who have disabilities, for example mono skis, bi 
skis, outriggers, and sit-skis, in accordance with the American with 
Disabilities Act (ADA) 28 CFR 36.302 (b)(2)(A)(ii) requirements concerning 
reasonable modifications in rules, practices, or procedures, unless the entity 
can demonstrate that making such modifications would be a adaptive equipment 
that meets this definition when requested by individuals wanting to enjoy 
winter sports at the 49&deg; North Ski Area <br>

<h1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - <strong>Motorized Use Policy</strong> View Details
</h1>  Motorized Use Policy <br>
 49&deg; North Ski Area <br>
<br>
 Use of 
Mobility Devices<br>
 The Ski Area allows individuals with mobility 
disabilities to use wheelchairs and manually-powered mobility aids, such as 
walkers, crutches, canes, braces, or other similar devices designed for use by 
individuals with mobility disabilities in areas open to pedestrian use.<br>
<br>
 Use of Adaptive Devices<br>
 The Ski Area allows the use of adaptive devices 
or other manually-powered mobility aids designed for use on the slopes. 
Adaptive devices are any specialized equipment that has been designed and 
manufactured primarily for use by individuals who have disabilities, including 
without limitation mono skis, bi skis, outriggers and sit-skis.<br>
<br>
 The 
Ski Area shall ask a person using another power-driven mobility device to 
provide a credible assurance that the mobility device is required because of 
the person&acute;s disability. The Ski Area accepts the presentation of a 
valid, State-issued, disability parking placard or card, or other State-issued 
proof of disability, as a credible assurance that the use of the other 
power-driven mobility device is for the individual&acute;s mobility disability. 
In the absence of such documents, the Ski Area shall allow the use of another 
power-driven mobility device if the individual states that the device is being 
used for a mobility disability. Any evidence to the contrary may be evaluated 
and acted upon by the Ski Area.<br>
<br>
 Summer Policy <br>
 The use of any 
power driven devices or vehicles by the public, including other power driven 
mobility devices used by individuals with mobility disabilities, that were not 
primarily designed for use by individuals with disabilities, creates a 
substantial risk of serious harm to the immediate environment and natural 
resources. Due to the need to address soil integrity, erosion and vegetative 
concerns, the Ski Area has adopted a motorized policy for the public during the 
summer season.<br>
<br>
 The Ski Area has determined that while the use of 
Segways by individuals with mobility disabilities, on trails are permitted, the 
use of ATVs, golf carts or pickup trucks by the public is not permitted. Use of 
these devices by the public would pose safety hazards to individuals using the 
trails for mountain biking and hiking given the size, weight, dimensions, and 
speed of these devices; the potential for collisions with other visitors; the 
high volume of traffic on the trails; and the substantial risk of serious 
impacts to natural resources caused by these vehicles.<br>
<br>
 Winter Policy 
<br> The Ski Area has determined that the use of any power-driven devices or 
vehicles by the public, including other power-driven mobility devices used by 
individuals with mobility disabilities, would conflict with the Ski Areas 
safety requirements necessary for the reasonably safe operation of our on-slope 
activities. These safety concerns include the use of devices on the slopes that 
expose the user and skiers/snowboarders to a safety hazard; collisions with 
downhill skiers and snowboarders; and the use of devices that may provide 
access into closed areas that pose avalanche hazards. These safety concerns are 
compounded by our facilities high volume of trail use. These safety 
requirements are based on actual risks and are not intended to be 
discriminatory in any way.<br>
<br>
 Forest Service designation in the Colville 
National Forest Travel Management Plan as shown on the Motor Vehicle Use Map

<h1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - <strong>Where can I store my belongings?</strong> 
View Details</h1>  Day lockers and seasonal lockers are available. Many guests 
often place their belongings in the lodge under the tables. Be aware that 
following this trend can result in stolen or lost possessions. Please keep 
tables clear when you are not using them. Lodge space is limited, so please be 
courteous to others. <br>
<br>

<h1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - <strong>Can I get a refund on my season pass?</strong>
View Details</h1>  Season passes are non-refundable. Transfers may be made in 
special cases, such as serious injury or moving over 200 miles due to 
employment related reasons. Both cases will require documentation from your 
doctor or employer. The decision to transfer a season pass will be made on a 
case-by-case basis. Once a pass is issued, they cannot be transferred. Contact 
the ticket office for specific details. <br>
<br>

<h1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - <strong>When do you open?</strong> View Details</h1>  
Opening day is much anticipated. Cooperation of the weather gods is the key. We 
shoot to open around Thanksgiving but will certainly open earlier if we can. We 
are lucky to have grass all the way to our summit and very few rocks. We 
manicure our slopes during the summer months so we can open with great 
conditions with a minimum of snow. Do your part, burn a board or a pair of skis
