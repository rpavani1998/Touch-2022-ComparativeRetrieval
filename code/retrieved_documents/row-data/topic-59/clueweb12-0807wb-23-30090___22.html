<h2>Abstract</h2> 
<p><strong>Background</strong> Alpine skiing and snowboarding have a 
substantial risk of injuries, but precise risk factor estimates are limited.</p>
<p><strong>Objective</strong> To determine the risk factors among skiers and 
snowboarders.</p> 
<p><strong>Study design</strong> Case-control study. </p> 
<p><strong>Methods</strong> Ski patrols reported cases (N=3277) in eight major 
Norwegian alpine resorts. Injury type and risk factors (age, gender, 
nationality, skill level, equipment, helmet use, ski school attendance, rented 
or own equipment) were recorded. An uninjured control group (N=2992) was 
obtained at the same resorts. A multivariate logistic regression analysis was 
used to assess the relationship between individual risk factors and risk of 
injury.</p> 
<p><strong>Results</strong> The overall injury risk was increased among 
beginners (OR 2.72; 2.12 to 3.47), children (OR 1.72; 1.41 to 2.13), 
adolescents (OR 2.16; 1.72 to 2.66) and non-Nordic skiers (OR 1.80; 1.37 to 
2.36). Snowboarders had a higher overall injury risk than skiers (OR 2.11; 1.81 
to 2.46). Alpine skiers (OR 2.65; 1.47 to 4.80), beginners (OR 2.50; 1.61 to 
3.85), children (OR 11.1; 6.7 to 20.0) and adolescents (OR 4.17; 2.44 to 7.14) 
were prone to lower leg fractures. Knee injuries occurred more frequently among 
alpine skiers (OR 1.82; 1.39 to 2.38), females (OR 1.67; 1.38 to 2.03) and 
beginners (OR 3.13; 2.50 to 3.85). Males (OR 1.85; 1.45 to 2.38), telemark 
skiers (OR 1.70; 1.30 to 2.23), children (OR 2.22; 1.37 to 3.57) and adults (OR 
1.64; 1.11 to 2.37) had an increased risk for shoulder injuries.</p> 
<p><strong>Conclusions</strong> Snowboarders, beginners, children and 
adolescents had an increased injury risk.</p> Previous Section Next Section <br>
<h2>Introduction</h2> 
<p>Skiing and snowboarding are winter sports enjoyed by several hundred 
million people worldwide, and they are increasingly popular. However, they also 
represent activities with high potential for traumatic injury.1 2 Alpine skiing 
has been the dominant discipline in Norwegian ski resorts. However, during the 
1990s, telemark skiing and, in particular, snowboarding gained popularity.3 The 
injury risk is high,2 and serious injuries are common in both skiers and 
snowboarders.4,&ndash;,6 Thus, downhill winter sports injuries represent a 
significant concern. Safety initiatives should be developed to target this 
population.</p> 
<p>Several risk factors for injuries in these disciplines have been suggested, 
such as age, gender and skill level,1,&ndash;,10 but the results are equivocal 
and there are few studies which include a representative control group of 
uninjured skiers and snowboarders.1 7,&ndash;,9 11 Even less is known about the 
risk factors for specific injury types, and whether these differ between the 
disciplines of alpine skiing, telemark skiing and snowboarding.</p> 
<p>The authors therefore conducted a case-control study to explore the effects 
of a number of assumed risk factors for injury, including age, gender and 
ability, on overall injury risk as well as the risk for knee injuries, shoulder 
injuries and lower leg fractures.</p> Previous Section Next Section <br>

<h2>Materials and methods</h2> 
<p>Ski patrols at eight major Norwegian ski resorts registered injuries during 
the 2002 winter season (Geilo, Hafjell, Trysil, Norefjell, Hovden, Oppdal, 
Hemsedal and &Aring;lsheia). These eight ski resorts account for about 55% of 
the ski lift transports in Norway, based on the number of tickets sold 
(personal communication, Andreas R&oslash;dven, Norwegian Ski Lift Association).
</p> 
<p>An injury was recorded when a skier or snowboarder was treated by or 
consulted with the ski patrol or first aid room staff after an accident in the 
skiing area during skiing or lift transport. To qualify for the ski patrol, the 
personnel are required to go through a structured programme of first aid 
education. A standard form was used to record personal data (age, gender, 
nationality), as well as information on the type of equipment (alpine skis, 
telemark skis (which permit a turning technique with free heel lift), 
snowboard, sleigh or other), use of helmet (yes/no), previous ski school 
attendance (yes/no), rented or own equipment (yes/no) and skiing ability. 
Skiing ability was classified into four categories (beginner, intermediate, 
good or expert) based on self-reported performance of turns.12 In addition, the 
ski patrol recorded whether the injury occurred in prepared runs, in the 
snowboard park, off-piste (outside groomed runs), while taking the ski lift or 
getting on/off. The anatomical location (head, neck, shoulder, etc.) and injury 
type was recorded (classified as fracture, dislocation, sprain, contusion, skin 
wound or illness), as well as whether the patient needed transportation to a 
physician or hospital for further evaluation and treatment. Such patients were 
defined as potentially severe cases. For patients with multiple injuries (less 
than 1%), each injury was recorded as a separate case.</p> 
<p>As a control group, uninjured skiers and snowboarders were interviewed in 
the same eight ski resorts during the same season (N=2992). The target number 
interviewed corresponded to the expected injury count from each resort, 
estimated from injury surveillance data from the previous years.3 The 
interviews were conducted at the entry of the bottom main ski lift at each 
resort. Every tenth skier or snowboarder waiting in line was interviewed, to 
achieve a representative sample of the skiing population. The interviews were 
done every Wednesday and Saturday during the four winter months of 2002 by 
personnel, who were not told the purpose of the study. The registration was 
done when lifts opened in the morning and after lunch (ie, 10am&ndash;11am and 
1pm&ndash;2pm). This is when most users enter the area, and the main lifts 
serve to feed a number of other lifts, which take the skiers further into the 
mountain area to ski the runs available. Except for the injury-related 
information, the questions asked were the same as for the injured skiers (ie, 
age, gender, nationality, equipment type, use of helmet, previous ski school 
attendance, rented or own equipment and skiing ability.</p> 
<p>To study the relationships between potential risk factors and injury, the 
authors chose a multiple logistic regression model with injury as the dependent 
variable, and equipment, age, gender, ability, nationality, used rented 
equipment, attended skiing instruction and helmet use as the adjustment 
factors. The adjusted ORs were then compared with the crude ORs, and if the 
difference exceeded 20%, major confounding could be involved. The authors used 
SPSS (PASW Statistics 18) for the analyses.</p> 
<p>Interaction between two risk factors on injury was tested on the relative 
scale by creating a product term between them as an added factor, which was 
tested for significance by the likelihood ratio method. None were found, and 
data are therefore not given. ODs are presented with 95% CIs. An &alpha; level 
of 0.05 was considered as statistically significant. All p values are 
two-tailed.</p> Previous Section Next Section <br>

<h2>Results</h2> 
<p>Of the 3277 injuries recorded, there were 1607 injuries among alpine skiers 
(49.1%), 1391 in snowboarding (42.5%) and 179 in telemark skiing (5.5%); 2.8% 
of cases missing due to unknown equipment. A total of 1752 (53%) were referred 
to a physician or hospital by the ski patrol for further assessment or 
treatment (potentially severe injuries).Table 1 depicts the distribution of 
injuries within subgroups of age, gender, nationality, skiing ability, 
equipment, rented or own equipment, skiing instruction and helmet wear compared 
to the control group. There were significant differences in the distribution of 
age, nationality, skiing ability, equipment type and rented/own equipment 
between injured skiers and controls. When comparing those with potentially 
severe injuries to the other injury cases, there were differences related to 
nationality, equipment and skiing instruction (table 1). </p> View this table:

<p>Distribution of injury cases in number and percentage by age, gender, 
nationality, skiing ability, equipment, used rented equipment, attained skiing 
instruction and helmet wear.</p> 
<p>The results from a crude and adjusted logistic regression analysis of the 
relationship between any injury and the potential risk factors are shown in
table 2. Age, nationality, skiing ability and the type of equipment were the 
significant risk factors. Snowboarding was associated with a two-fold higher 
risk of injury than alpine skiing, while there was no significant difference in 
injury risk between alpine and telemark skiing (table 2). Beginners were at a 
higher risk of injuries compared to the intermediate, good and expert skiers 
(OR ranging from 2.12 to 3.47), and non-Nordic skiers were at a higher risk 
than the Nordic skiers (OR 1.37 to 2.36). Compared to children up to 12 years 
of age, adolescents (13&ndash;20 years) suffered more injuries and adults 
(&gt;20 years) fewer injuries. Female skiers and snowboarders had a significant 
lower risk of injuries in the crude model, but this was not statistically 
significant in the adjusted test. Helmet use, skiing instruction and ski rental 
did not influence the overall injury risk.</p> View this table:

<p>The adjusted ORs were then compared with the crude ORs, and the difference 
did not exceed 20%.</p> 
<p>From a multiple logistic regression analysis of the relationship between 
the potentially severe injuries and controls, the authors detected that 
beginners (OR 2.50, 2.08 to 3.33; p&lt;0.001), snowboarders (OR 2.11, 1.80 to 
2.47; p&lt;0.001) and non-Nordic skiers (OR 1.89, 1.37 to 2.32; p&lt;0.001) had 
a higher risk, while adults over 20 years (OR 0.65, 0.51 to 0.85; p=0.001) and 
female skiers/boarders (OR 0.81, 0.70 to 0.93;p=0.003) had a reduced risk of 
potentially severe injuries.</p> 
<p>Table 3 compares injury type to body region. The most frequently injured 
regions were the head (17.6%), knee (17.4%), wrist (13.8%) and shoulder 
(11.8%), while the most frequent injury types were contusions (35.2%), 
fractures (27.9%) and sprains (23.6%).</p> View this table:

<p>Table 4 shows the relationship between skiing equipment and the injured 
body region. In alpine skiing, knee injuries were the most frequent (27.3%), in 
snowboarding wrist injuries (25.9%) and in telemark skiing shoulder injuries 
(20.1%). Head injuries were frequent across all disciplines (17.8% to 17.9%).

<p>The authors also performed multiple logistic regression analyses to examine 
the risk factors for some of the most common injury types; lower leg fractures (
table 5), knee injuries (table 6), and shoulder injuries (table 7). </p> View

<p>For lower leg fractures (table 5), beginners had a risk 2.5 times higher, 
compared to non-beginners, and children under 12 years had a risk four times 
higher than in adolescents and eleven times than in adult skiers. Alpine skiers 
had a significantly higher risk of lower leg fractures compared to snowboarders 
and telemark skiers.</p> 
<p>For knee injuries (table 6), the authors found the highest risk among 
females, beginners, alpine skiers and non-Nordic skiers/boarders.</p> 
<p>For shoulder injuries (table 7), telemarkers, children under 12 years and 
adults compared to adolescents, non-Nordic and males were at higher risk.</p> 
<p>Crude analyses of injury risk concerning lower leg fractures, knee injuries 
and shoulder injuries did not differ more than 15% from the adjusted analyses, 
thus there is a low degree of confounding.</p> 
<p>Collision with another person or obstacle was reported in 12.9% of all 
cases, and the remaining injuries were the result of a fall or a jump. Injury 
as a result of collision was seen more frequently among the alpine skiers 
(15.6%) than in the other disciplines (9.5%).</p> Previous Section Next Section 
<br> 
<h2>Discussion</h2> 
<p>The main findings of the present study were that beginners, snowboarders, 
children and adolescents were at increased overall risk of injury.</p> 
<p>Rented equipment and skiing instruction did not seem to influence the 
overall risk of injury, while skiing instruction decreased the risk of 
potentially severe injuries. The injury pattern varied between the three 
disciplines, snowboarding, alpine and telemark skiing, reflecting the inherent 
differences in user technique and equipment design. Being a beginner was 
associated with a 2.5 times higher risk of injury. The idea that beginners are 
at higher risk, is well established in the literature, but the risk estimates 
have been inconsistent, varying from 1.6 to 7 times higher risk.9,&ndash;,11 13 
14</p> 
<p>Whether the female skiers and snowboarders have the same injury risk and 
distribution as the men is controversial. Prodromos<em>et al</em>15 found no 
gender differences in ACL (anterior cruciate ligament) tear risk for either 
recreational or expert alpine skiers in a meta-analysis investigating gender 
differences for ACL injury in different sports activities. Langran and Selvaraj7
 found no relation with gender in a case-control study during the winter of 
2000, involving 674 injured skiers and snowboarders and 336 controls. However, 
Wasden<em>et al</em>16 concluded that men are at a higher risk of injuries 
while skiing or snowboarding, based on a retrospective case series of 1142 
skiers and snowboarders treated at the local medical center, but this study did 
not have a matching control group. In this study, the authors found a 19% lower 
overall injury risk for female skiers and snowboarders in the crude analysis, 
but this was not significant in the adjusted model. However, the authors did 
see a 67% higher risk for knee injuries among female skiers and snowboarders, 
as well as a 46% lower risk for shoulder injuries and 32% lower risk for head 
injuries. These gender differences are pointed out in a paper by Shealy and 
co-workers, 1996.17 Female athletes are more prone to knee injuries in most 
sports (ACL ruptures in particular).18 The injury often occurs as a combination 
of compressive loading and twisting of the knee.19 This mechanism is typical in 
the alpine skiing discipline, when the skier loses balance or the ski edge 
catches during a turn.20 21 Upper limb and head injuries are often associated 
with falling from a jump.22 23 Thus, more cautious skiing may be an explanation 
for why female skiers and snowboarders have a lower risk for upper limb and 
head/neck injuries.</p> 
<p>Sacco <em>et al</em>24 found that alpine skiers and snowboarders were 
equally prone to injury in an evaluation of skiing and snowboarding injuries 
admitted to the local level 1 trauma center over a 6-year period, but without 
any control material their conclusion is difficult to interpret. Langran<em>et 
al</em>7 based on their case-control study demonstrated that snowboarders were 
more likely to sustain upper limb or axial injury, while lower limb injuries 
were more common in the alpine group. However, they concluded that there is no 
difference in the overall risk between the two disciplines. In two other 
studies without control groups, Xiang<em>et al</em>25 found no significant 
differences in overall injury risk or admittance to hospital between skiers and 
snowboarders, while Dohjima<em>et al</em>6 found that snowboarders had a 6 
times higher injury risk. In the present study, the authors found that 
snowboarders had twice the overall injury risk of alpine and telemark skiers, 
and a three times higher risk for potentially severe injuries. However, while 
snowboarders had a higher injury rate than skiers for injuries to the upper 
body, they sustained fewer lower limb injuries than alpine skiers. In fact, 
alpine skiers had more than twice the risk of knee injuries compared to 
snowboarders, and also a significantly higher risk than telemark skiers. The 
reason why snowboarders suffer fewer injuries to their legs and, in particular, 
their knees is probably because both feet are fixed to the board. The board is 
unable to act independently as a lever, thus reducing the twisting and bending 
forces on the individual knee.</p> 
<p>Some authors claim that the injury rate for shoulder injuries is quite 
similar between disciplines,7 26,&ndash;,28 while others have found a much 
higher incidence among snowboarders than alpine skiers.29 30 These conclusions 
are mostly based on studies without control groups. McCall<em>et al</em>30 
debated this issue in a recent review, concluding that shoulder injuries 
account for 8% to 16% of snowboarding injuries and 4% to 11% of alpine skiing 
injuries. In this study, the proportion of shoulder injuries was highest among 
telemark skiers (20%) compared to alpine and snowboarders (11% each). Adjusted 
for other factors, telemark skiers had a 70% higher risk for shoulder injuries 
compared to snowboarders, while there was no significant difference between 
snowboarders and alpine skiers.</p> 
<p>The authors also found that adults and children have a significantly higher 
risk of shoulder injuries than adolescents. Fractures in the shoulder were 
common in children, while adults sustained more dislocations.</p> 
<p>Lower leg fractures are thought to be a particular risk among younger 
skiers, but exact risk estimates are missing. Data showed that children younger 
than 13 years had a four times higher risk than adolescents, and 11 times 
higher risk than adults. Langran<em>et al</em>7 found that tibia/fibula 
fractures represented 5% of injuries to alpine skiers and 0.5% among 
snowboarders. The authors found that alpine skiers had about 2.5 times the risk 
of snowboarders and telemark skiers. Other risk factors for lower leg fractures 
were skiing ability and nationality. Since their introduction, ski release 
bindings are thought to have reduced dramatically the incidence of lower leg 
fractures among alpine skiers.7 31 Nevertheless, lower leg fractures are still 
common in young alpine skiers (17% of all injuries in alpine skiers up to 12 
years old). The high lower leg fracture rate among children is an issue which 
needs to be addressed, as release bindings alone do not seem to have solved the 
problem in this age group. The data used in this study were collected in 2002, 
and the authors do not know how changes in equipment or skier/snowboarder 
behavior over the past years may impact on the relevance of the study.</p>

<h2>Limitations</h2> 
<p>Recent studies on the risk factors of skiing and snowboarding injury have 
to some extent been inconclusive because they lack an appropriate control group 
or the number of injuries has been too small for multivariate analyses. The 
strength of the current study is that the authors could assess key risk factors 
in alpine skiing and snowboarding by comparing injured cases to an uninjured, 
representative control group, while correcting for important confounders.</p> 
<p>Central to the injury reporting is also the definition of an injury. 
According to the authors' definition, an injury is whatever was reported to and 
registered by the ski patrol. Obtaining a control group representative of all 
skiers and snowboarders at risk is another difficult task. The controls were 
registered during &lsquo;rush-hour&rsquo; in the morning and after lunch, when 
most users were entering the area through the bottom main ski lift. All users 
entered here, and many users would end up there after a run, even after going 
off-piste or in the snowboard park. The authors selected Wednesdays and 
Saturdays to sample the control group to compensate for differences in user 
characteristics between weekdays and weekends, and matched the number of 
controls to the expected injury count in each ski area. Potential confounding 
by type of run or weekday of injury may have been accounted for, at least in 
part, by factors adjusted for in the analysis, for example, nationality, skiing 
ability, rented equipment and skiing instruction.</p> 
<p>The authors have not assessed the number of injured skiers and snowboarders 
that bypass the ski patrol for their injuries. Studies have shown that 
self-reported injuries may be up to ten times higher than recorded by ski 
patrols, but also that those missed by ski patrols were minor.26 27 The results 
of these studies showed that injury risk factors were quite consistent between 
less and potentially more severe cases, which means that a reporting bias was 
unlikely.</p> 
<p>Recall bias is not likely to have been a significant factor, since 
interviews were done on the spot, usually within a few minutes after the 
injury. Although the authors do not know how a stressful injury situation may 
have affected how skiers report their skiing ability or ski instruction, most 
other factors could be observed directly by the ski patrol.</p> Previous Section

<h2>Conclusions</h2> 
<p>Children, adolescents, beginners and snowboarders have an increased injury 
risk. Alpine skiers, beginners, males, children and adolescents are at a higher 
risk of lower leg fractures, telemark skiers, males and adolescents are at a 
higher risk of shoulder injuries, while knee injuries occur more frequently 
among alpine skiers, females and beginners.</p> Previous Section Next Section
