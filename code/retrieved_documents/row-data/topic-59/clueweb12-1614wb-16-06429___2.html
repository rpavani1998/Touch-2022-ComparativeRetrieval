<h1>Ski Areas</h1> 
<p>Edmonton Ski Club has five ski areas on it&rsquo;s site with <strong>8 
trail areas</strong> in varying degrees of difficulty.</p> 
<p><strong>Bunny Hill</strong> is the <strong>beginners area</strong> and is 
serviced by a tow rope. This area is marked as a green area and is regularly 
groomed and has a small pitch which enables beginners in Skiing or Snowboarding 
to learn how to get started and the different techniques required to move on to 
a more difficult terrain.</p> 
<p><strong>Tin Can Alley</strong></p> 
<p>Serviced from the Bunny Tow rope the area has two elevated areas of 
slightly steeper pitch, one of which includes &ldquo;rollers&rdquo; for 
advancing beginners in balance and strength.</p> 
<p><strong>T-Bar</strong> is our longest run and is made up of three varying 
pitches.<strong>Intermediate and more advanced</strong> skier and snowboarding 
areas.<strong>Race Line</strong> is the area used on a regular basis by Race 
Teams as a training area and runs parallel with the lift. &nbsp;<strong>The Knob
</strong> runs off the front face on the left hand side off<strong> </strong>
Race Line and<strong>The Gulley</strong> has a more gentler pitch off to the 
right of the The Knob for beginner skiers and boarders that are moving on to 
more difficult terrain with instructors.</p> 
<p><strong>Twin Birch</strong> is our steepest pitched run and is classed as a 
<strong>Black Diamond</strong>. This area is for skiers and boarders that are 
at a more<strong>advanced level</strong> and is serviced by a poma lift. To the 
right of Twin Birch is<strong>Cascade</strong> a 36ft wide area of moguls.</p> 
<p>The <strong>Lucky&rsquo;s </strong><strong>Terrain Park</strong> is 
serviced by the Twin Birch poma. Again this area has a variety of pitches, 
jumps, rails, bars and tubes. For skiers and boarders that are at a more<strong>
advanced level</strong> of freestyle. All jumps, rails, bars and tubes are 
marked with the degree of difficulty, it isimportant for all boarders and 
skiers using this area to familiarize themselves with the<strong>Terrain Park 
Rules</strong>.</p> 
<p><br>
</p>
