<p> </p> <strong>COLORADO SKIING</strong> <strong>HISTORY</strong> <br>
<br>

<br> 
<h2>THE EVOLUTION OF A SPORT</h2> 
<p>With origins dating back to 2500 BC, the face of skiing has changed 
dramatically through the years. Once simply a mode of transportation, skiing 
has been used in military training and combat, as a form of recreation, and as 
a competitive sport. From long boards to short &quot;fat&quot; skis, telemark 
skiing to alpine skiing, ski jumping to slalom racing, skiing is more popular 
than ever before. And here in the Colorado high country, it lives on, not just 
as a sport, but as a thriving way of life.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p><br>
</p> 
<h3>EMERGENCE OF SKIING IN COLORADO</h3> 
<p>While the European sport and recreation skiing scene was quickly carving a 
popular niche at the end of the 19th century, skiing in Colorado and much of 
the West was emerging out of necessity. By the late 1800's, Colorado's high 
country was bustling with miners searching for the big strike. Men, many with 
families in tow, came from all over the world in search of a grand fortune, and 
they arrived to find a beautiful and harsh environment. Towering peaks and 
heavy snowfalls made travel by wagon, train, or horse difficult, if not 
impossible at times. Scandinavian miners who joined the influx of immigrants 
offered a solution. They taught their fellow mountain dwellers how to craft 
skis and use them to travel through the snow, whether it was simply to ski to 
town to pick up supplies, ski to school or visit friends.</p> 
<p>The group most famous for ski travel in the mining days were the mailmen. 
These hardy individuals lashed on eleven-foot wooden boards, threw 25 pound 
mailbags on their backs, and traveled from one mining camp to the next, often 
over dangerous mountain passes in the dead of night when the crusty snow made 
travelling easier. Skiing soon emerged as a form of entertainment. Jumping and 
racing contests were established in camps to pass the long winter days. As the 
century came to a close and mining began to dwindle, skiing gained momentum as 
a sport and a form of recreation. Clubs sprang up throughout the state. As 
interest grew, so did the sports clubs' membership, which led to an increase in 
competitions but also provided companionship for a casual day on the slopes.<br>
<br> In the decades to come, a growing interest in alpine skiing, innovations 
in ski equipment, an increasing number of national and international events, 
and the U.S. hosting the 1932 Olympics in Lake Placid led to a soaring interest 
in the sport. Small ski areas popped up around Colorado, and in January 1940, 
the first major ski area in Colorado was dedicated at Winter Park.<br>
<br>
 As 
tragedy struck when the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor, the nation's focus 
naturally shifted away from recreational pursuits. However, during the war 
years, skiers in Colorado were still getting out on the mountains, even if the 
towropes weren't running. In fact, the war would be a major factor in the 
soon-to-come Colorado skiing boom.<br>
</p> 
<h3>10th MOUNTAIN DIVISION</h3> 
<p>In 1941 the 10th Mountain Division, comprised, in part, of former 
collegiate skiers, coaches and Olympians, was established for military combat 
on skis. About 14,000 men trained at Camp Hale located near Leadville between 
1941 and 1944.</p> 
<p>Training for the 10th Mountain Division included snowshoeing, skiing, high 
altitude survival and cold weather training. To help the troops battle the 
elements, gear was subsequently revolutionized, and many of the innovations 
that sprung from Camp Hale provided models for modern day equipment. For 
instance, the men wore an all-around boot designed for use when skiing, 
snowshoeing, hiking or climbing, and ski bindings could be used for either 
downhill or cross-country skiing.<br>
<br>
 The 10th's most notable tour of 
duty was in Italy, a mission that eventually led the Germans to surrender. In a 
night assault, 10th troops climbed 1500-foot sheer cliffs thought impassable, 
and took the ridge which was a key position in German defense.<br>
</p> 
<h3>POST-WAR BOOM</h3> 
<p>With the war behind them, the troops of the 10th headed home, but many 
sought the mountain lifestyle they enjoyed during their tour of duty. In 
Colorado and throughout the West, former 10th Mountain Division soldiers 
discovered their own pieces of heaven, and many opened ski areas or helped run 
existing ones. To date, close to 60 ski areas in the U.S. have been constructed 
and/or founded by veterans of the 10th Mountain Division.</p> 
<p><br>
 As the post-war economy boomed in the U.S., so did skiing. Ski areas 
installed lifts and T-bars, and night skiing was even instituted in Colorado 
with the first lighted runs at the Continental Ski Area on top of Fremont pass. 
In addition to attracting a flood of recreational ski enthusiasts, Colorado was 
also attracting major competitions. In 1950 Aspen hosted the World Alpine Ski 
Championships which marked the coming of age for skiing in this country.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p><br>
</p> 
<h3>THE AGE OF MODERN RESORTS</h3> 
<p>Unlike the European ski scene that developed around existing summer alpine 
resorts that simply extended their season to accommodate the sport, Colorado 
ski areas lacked resort status. Restaurants, lodging, and parking did not exist 
at most ski areas, and it was only Aspen, with its Jerome Hotel, that could 
claim resort status In order to meet the rising demand, resorts at 
Breckenridge, Vail, Crested Butte and Steamboat Springs rose rapidly with great 
success. By the early 1970s Colorado had earned its status as a prime skiing 
destination and paved the way for more resorts to open up including Telluride, 
Keystone and Copper Mountain.<br>
</p> 
<h3>SNOWBOARDING GIVES A FACE-LIFT</h3> 
<p></p> 
<h3></h3> 
<p>The sport of skiing, long associated with Europe's upper-crust, was gaining 
&quot;elite sport&quot; status in the U.S. The large resorts catered to people 
hoping for a posh destination vacation, which gave skiing an air of 
sophis-tication. Yet the ingenuity of a few &quot;garage&quot; and 
&quot;backyard&quot; invent-ors would add a fresh new element to the ski resort 
experience. By the mid-1970's a handful of innovators -- Jon Burton, Mike 
Olson, Bob Webber, Tom Sims, Sherman Popper and Dimitri Milovich -- had each 
developed what would evolve into the modern snowboard. By 1981, the first 
snowboarding competi-tion was held at Ski Cooper in Leadville, Colorado, and 
ski areas have never been the same since. Resorts that once subtly snubbed 
their noses at the enthusiastic riders, are now catering to their interests. 
Half-pipes and snowboard terrain parks have been built throughout the state, 
and many resorts host snowboard competitions that receive worldwide coverage. 
Though the sport is still relatively young, it is sure to be a force on the 
mountainfor decades to come.<br>
</p> 
<h3>COLORADO SKIING TODAY</h3> 
<p>With continuing innovations in ski technology, expanded terrain, and a 
world-class resort experience, skiing in Colorado just seems to get better and 
better. More than just the cash cow of the state's economy, skiing is sacred to 
many Coloradoans and those who travel here to live the mountain lifestyle. 
Though the sport will continue to undergo countless innovations as we move into 
the 21st century, there is a sense of certainty that skiing will remain for 
many, not just a sport, not just a form of recreation, but the only way of life.
