</li> </ul> Gressoney is a well located ski area set 
in the spectacular Alpine scenery of the Monte Rosa region of north west Italy. 
The Gressoney name covers the whole valley, some 12km (seven-and-a-half miles) 
long, which is the central one of three lift-linked valleys, thus the area is 
sometimes called &quot;Italy's Three Valleys&quot;.<br>
<br>
 Although it is 
not on the scale of the famous French Three Valleys, it is a big area with 
nearly 200km (125 miles) of piste spread across varied terrain. It extends up 
to Western Europe's second highest peak, Monte Rosa, opening up one of the 
world's largest lift-served skiable verticals above neighbouring Alagna. 
Gressoney itself has descents nearing the world's biggest, with vertical 
descents approaching 2000 metres possible.<br>
<br>
 The Gressoney Valley 
contains several different village bases and it is worthwhile checking which 
one accommodation offered is in and how that location relates to the ski lift 
network. Gressoney La Trintie at 1637m is the highest of the main villages and 
connected to Alagna.<br>
<br>
 However Stadfal at the top of the Valley is 
connected by cable car to Champoluc in the third valley in the other direction, 
as well as by gondola to Alagna also. The largest village in the area is 
Gressoney St Jean which is lower down at 1387m. It is not directly connected to 
the main ski areas, although it does have a small ski area of its own.<br>
<br>

 The villages are all quite attractive in themselves, most with a traditional 
Italian stone and wood chalet style design of building, and endeavour to keep 
alive the ancient regional Walser cultural traditions, which originated in the 
area in the thirteenth century. The ancient language and customs are maintained 
by local associations and reflected in museums and cultural events. 
<ul> 
<li> 
<h2>Skiing for Beginners+</h2>  There are nursery slopes dotted around the 
valley, although the most convenient are at resort level in Gressoney St. Jean. 
Those staying in Gressoney La Trinite and Stafal are more likely to take the 
chairlift or gondolas up to altitude nursery slopes at Gabiet or Punta Jolanda.
<br> <br>
 The only problem there is that the runs back down to resort are 
quite steep for beginners (graded red) so it is likely you will need to get the 
lift back down for most of your first week. Indeed there are not many blue runs 
locally to progress on to. Ski School operates mornings from Monday to Friday. 
</li> 
<li> 
<h2>Intermediate Skiing+</h2>  In terms of on-piste terrain, intermediates 
will enjoy Monte Rosa the most, with more than 40 red (intermediate) graded 
runs to choose from covering about three quarters of the groomed trails. Lifts 
up to Passo Salati open up huge vertical descents either back to Gressoney or 
down to the classic resort of Alagna on one side and to Colle Bettaforca on the 
other, accessing the Ayas valley above Champoluc and Antagnod.<br>
<br>
 The 
skiing is varied, above and below the treeline and always with wonderful 
scenery all around. For a change, the small local area at Gressoney St. Jean, 
separate from the rest of the circuit, can provide a day's entertainment. </li> 
<li> 
<h2>Advanced+</h2>  The Monte Rosa region is firmly on the &quot;must 
ski&quot; list for advanced skiers because of its big verticals and spectacular 
off piste descents. The only point that needs to be clear is that the 
challenges do mostly lie off the beaten piste - there are eight black runs 
dotted around, but they only offer about nine kilometres (six miles) of groomed 
black descents between them, including the Leonardo David slope, valid for the 
alpine ski world cup.<br>
<br>
 However the area is most famous for its 
freeriding, not its groomed steeps. It is therefore well worth signing up for a 
guided tour or for ski touring expeditions. The area pass covers the entire 
Monte Rosa area but also other resorts in the Aosta Valley including Pila and 
la Thuile, from where you can ski over the border to La Rosiere in France.<br>

<br> Excursions to the Vallee Blanche, the world's longest off piste descent 
above Chamonix and Courmayeur are offered. Heliskiing is also popular, with 
descents including a route from Zermatt in Switzerland down to Champoluc. </li> 
<li> 
<h2>Snowboarding at Gressoney+</h2>  There are no terrain parks in the area 
and the main attraction, as for better skiers, is the extensive freeriding 
terrain. Heli-boarding is an option the well-heeled and technically able will 
wish to take advantage of from the resort. </li> 
<li> 
<h2>Other Activities And Facilities at Gressoney+</h2>  Most of the rather 
limited range of activities beyond downhill skiing and boarding in the valley 
are outdoor-based and include paragliding, sliding around on all terrain 
vehicles (ATV) or quad biking on an ice circuit. And there are 30km of 
cross-country skiing, and snow shoeing.<br>
<br>
 Gressoney-St-Jean has the 
widest selection of shops and a weekly market. It is also home to the valley's 
public swimming pool and a natural ice rink. </li> 
<li> 
<h2>Apres Ski And Dining Out+</h2>  Apr&egrave;s ski is informal throughout 
the Gressoney valley and centred on local hotel bars, restaurants and 
caf&eacute;s. Gressoney St. Jean has the widest selection of evening eateries 
with about 30 to choose from. In Gressoney La Trinite there are about half that 
number.<br>
<br>
 In either case the food choices are predominantly local 
dishes from the region and standard Italian pasta and pizza. In La Trinite the 
Hirsch Stube is one of the best bars. At the base of the lifts in Stafal visit 
the Kramenthal for good local specialities. </li> 
<li> 
<h2>Ski Holidays in Gressoney suitable for Families+</h2>  There is not a 
great deal especially designed for children in the Gressoney valley, although 
the area's strong community values, friendly people and establishments and 
beautiful setting all make it a pleasant place for a family ski trip.<br>
<br>
 
The local Monte Rosa ski school accepts children for regular lessons for 
two-and-a-half hours on five days in the week, from age four. The school has 
some English speaking staff. There is no nursery provision for younger children 
and, depending on the number and age mix of participants, even the youngest 
children may be out in mixed-groups with adults. Snowboarding lessons are 
available from age ten. </li> </ul>
