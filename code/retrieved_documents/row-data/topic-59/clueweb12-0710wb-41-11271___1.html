<b>Associated trip report:
</b>&nbsp;Although I usually go up into Silver Creek valley to ski in the 
spring, when the trail which climbs up to the hanging valley is mostly bare, I 
thought that there might be enough snow now to ski all the way. Based on the 
reports of the last couple of days, I wasn't expecting good snow, at least in 
the lower reaches, and I was not disappointed.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The 4818 road 
was closed by about 2' of snow at the Lake Kachess snowpark (~2200'), so I 
fishscaled the 1.5 miles to the actual trailhead on forest roads nicely groomed 
by snowmobiles (none out today, fortunately). From there, I skinned up the 
trail, where the snow was mostly frozen tree-drip, or in the open, breakable 
crust. There had been gusty east winds on the road approach, but the climb was 
protected and the sun came out occasionally, softening the breakable crust in 
open areas. When I reached the lip of the hanging valley (~3600') and the start 
of the nice old-growth forest, the trees were suddenly holding lots of snow in 
their branches, and the quality of the snow became better - more powdery, 
though dense and still crusted in places from tree-drip. The snowpack was 4-5' 
deep here, judging from the stream banks. A pole could be pushed in 15-20&quot; 
before hitting a crust, but trail breaking wasn't bad as my skis only sank in a 
few inches at most. I skied about a mile up the valley (very flat here), then 
considered my options.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I have always had as my destination the 
meadows and short runs at the head of the valley, but I didn't think I would 
make it that far (another 4 miles) this day, so I decided to skin directly up 
the NE-facing valley slope to the top of Kachess Ridge. The first 600' was 
pretty straight-forward, in open forest and mostly on tree-bombed dense powder 
or light tree-drip, although it didn't look so good with descending eyes. Then 
I got into an area with many more small trees, and had to do some traversing to 
the left before I could climb again. I stopped for lunch, got cold (it was ~25 
degrees and somewhat windy), and so started skinning up again, discovering that 
my lunch spot was only about 50vf below the ridge top, which I gained at 
~4600'. Wow, it was a nice place! Open, wide, fringed with trees, and with 
great views out to Mt. Rainier, Snoqualmie Pass area peaks, and Mt. Stuart, and 
down to Kachess Lake and the Yakima River valley. There weren't much in the way 
of cornices, so I skinned N to the top of Point 4884. From there, it would be 
possible to continue on to Point 5194 (and beyond?), but I was out of time (it 
was 2:45), so I took off the skins and started my glorious 2600' powder run. 
Oops, that was another day.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The run down the ridge was fun, 
with a variety of not bad snow conditions - powder, light tree-drip, and, in 
exposed areas, stiff wind-pack. The run back down the NE slope to the valley 
floor was not good - too dense small trees at the top, too variable conditions 
to get any real rythym going for most of the rest of the way. I did find one 
open glade toward the bottom and got about 10 linked turns in very nice, dense 
powder. The ski back to the lip of the hanging valley was fast, and the waxless 
skis allowed me to climb the little rises along the way but get long glides as 
well. From there, I mostly skied right down the trail. Or rather, I 
side-slipped along the uphill side of the trail cut, the snow being way too 
fast to just point 'em, and this was easily the most tiring part of the trip. I 
gave up skiing the trail about 100vf from the trailhead because my tips kept 
getting caught on shrubs protruding from the dwindling snowpack, but had a fast 
glide/skate/double-pole ride back to the car on the forest roads.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Corn dog report: I stopped by the corn dog shack next to 
Traveller's Rest at Snoqualmie Pass on the way back. The shack is open and the 
corn dogs are as good as ever (and that means the best corn dogs in the world - 
dipped and fried while you wait). You can still get your dog dipped in jalapeno 
batter only on Saturdays and Sundays.<br>
