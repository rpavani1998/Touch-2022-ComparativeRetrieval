Attitash offers two linked 
mountains &#150; Attitash itself and Bear Peak &#150; with a range of terrain 
for boarders and skiers. Reasonably priced lift tickets combined with a 
family-friendly atmosphere make it an attractive and accessible destination <br>
<br> 
<p>A 3-hour drive from Boston takes you to the Attitash/Bear Peak snow sports 
area in the heart of New Hampshire. In addition to the opportunity of skiing in 
the Whites, the resort offers reasonably priced lift tickets that reflect the 
smaller scale and family focus of the place compared to mainstay resorts like 
Sunday River or Killington : full-day lift ticket prices (Sun-Fri) are free for 
those under five years, $39 for ages 6-12, $48 for ages 13-18, and $62 for 
adults. As usual, the resort charges more on Saturdays and holiday periods ($69 
for an adult ticket).</p> <br>
<br>

<p>The resort offers twelve lifts across two peaks, leading to 70 trails. Two 
of the lifts are high-speed quads, one regular quad, the rest are triples, 
doubles and surface lifts.</p> <br>
<br>

<p>The trails on Bear Peak offer a vertical drop of 1450 feet, Attitash 1750 
feet. Overall, you will find 36% of the trails rated most difficult, 40% more 
difficult and 24% easier. Bear Peak has several glade areas that are usually 
opened only after a good season of natural snow. In case the weather isn't 
cooperating, the resort claims to have 97% coverage of snowmaking. The resort 
features a 500 foot in-ground Superpipe, open to skiers and snowboarders alike.
</p> <br>
<br>
The resort has good children's lesson programs (all instruction 
programs are open until end of March 2009): <br>
Tiny Turns instruction program 
for kids 3-5 <br>
Buddy Bear instruction program for kids 4-6 (half day or full 
day) <br>
Adventure Kids program for kids 7-12 interested in skiing <br>

Lowriders program for kids 7-12 interested in snowboarding <br>
For kids 13 and 
older, programs to learn skiing and snowboarding or to improve their skills <br>
<br> <br>
<br>
For grown-ups, all-inclusive lessons are available for a day or 
on a multi-day basis for both skiing and snowboarding (see sidebar for details).
<br> <br>

<p>There are no dining facilities on the top of the slopes, but the lodge at 
the base of Attitash offers cafeteria and bar service, and the Grand Summit 
Hotel at the base of Bear Peak has a coffee shop and a restaurant that opens in 
the evenings.</p> <br>
<br>

<p>The most practical accommodation is the Grand Summit Resort Hotel, which 
has slopeside access. The village of North Conway is just a few minutes from 
the ski area. It is a reasonable location for lodging and dining options, 
conveniently located to Attitash and many other snow sports areas. If your 
condo has a kitchen, there is a grocery just a few minutes drive from the 
resort in the direction of North Conway.</p> <br>
<br>

<p>There are several great snow sports areas nearby, including Bretton Woods 
which offers night skiing, tubing and skating, Black Mountain and Wildcat at 
Jackson, Cranmore with night skiing, tubing and snoeshowing at North Conway, 
and King Pine at East Madison.</p> <br>
