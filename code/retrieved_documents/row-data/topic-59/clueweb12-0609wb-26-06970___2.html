<p> <b>Riders Guide</b> - Wildcat Mountain is a mountain resort that focuses 
completely on the mountain, rather than on the base-camp experience. Their more 
than 220 acres of boardable land and 50 amazing trails are impeccably groomed 
and expertly maintained. Wildcat is one of the best-kept mountains in the New 
Hampshire region. With an average snowfall of more than 16 feet and 90% 
snowmaking capabilities, the runs at Wildcat are a pleasure to ride.<br>
<br>

<b>Parks and Pipes</b> - Wildcat Mountain doesn&rsquo;t feature any parks or 
pipes. What the area lacks in terrain parks it more than makes up for in 
difficult, steep, long runs. Wildcat Mountain features some extremely 
challenging trails like the Upper Wildcat, the Lift Lion, and the Top Cat. The 
resort has more than 2,100 feet of vertical drop which should put a smile on 
the faces of speed junkies.<br>
<br>
<b>Out of Bounds</b> - Wildcat Mountain 
doesn&rsquo;t offer many activities other than fantastic skiing and 
snowboarding, its priorities are refreshingly straightforward, incredible 
trails and glades and none of the distractions found at other resorts, in other 
words, &ldquo;pure vertical fun.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
<b>Hangout &amp; Hookup</b> - 
The mountain itself only has one cafeteria and one apr&egrave;s ski pub. 
Fortunately the nearby towns of Gorham, Jackson and North Conway offer plenty 
of eateries and bars. The Shannon Door Pub in Jackson is a rustic Irish style 
pub which features live music on the weekends and delicious food daily. There 
are a large variety of restaurants in the area ranging from casual pizza joints 
to renowned gourmet dining.<br>
<br>
 There is no slope side lodging offered at 
Wildcat Mountain but they have partnered up with many of the area&rsquo;s 
accommodation to offer visitors enticing ski and stay packages throughout the 
season. For travelers on a tight budget, check out the upscale yet affordable 
White Mountains Lodge and Hostel which is a European style hostel housed in a 
gorgeously restored 19th century farmhouse located 12 miles north of the ski 
area.<br>
<br>
<b>The Deal</b> - Wildcat Mountain is about 15 miles from 
Jackson and Gorham and about 20 miles north of North Conway. By plane, the 
closest airport is in Portland, ME (79 mi.) the largest airport is 
Boston&rsquo;s Logan Airport (149 mi.). The mountain can also be reached by Bus 
from Boston&rsquo;s South Station, Concord Coach Lines operate twice daily to 
and from Boston with stops in North Conway Village and Jackson.</p> <br>
