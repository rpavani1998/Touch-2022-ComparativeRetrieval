 Doing a trick is difficult enough, 
but attempting them on ice adds a whole different layer of fail possibilities.

<p>Well, here's a collection of clips that some people probably wish had been 
discarded.</p> 
<p>In the spirit of the weather outside, we've created a mashup above of some 
of our favorite winter sports fails.</p> 
<p>As we discovered, there's a pretty simple formula that leads to most winter 
sports fails: ice + board + not being able to stop = great fail.</p> 
<p>Watch the video above and let us know which fail you think is the best or 
most cringeworthy (or perhaps both?) in the comments section.</p>  FOLLOW

on 02/09/2012 very much so. no matter how people lost over the years, ABC could 
never replace that clip as their &quot;Agony of Defeat&quot; moment as part of 
the opening montage. the victory was replaced over the years with things like 
the miracle on ice, the kirkland washington team winning the LLWS, etc. but 
never the agony of defeat.  Jim_Marusak: very much so. no matter how people
