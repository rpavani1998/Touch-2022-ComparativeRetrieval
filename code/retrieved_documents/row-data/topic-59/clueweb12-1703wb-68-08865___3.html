<h1>Skiing &amp; Snowboarding Injuries Top the Charts for Winter Sports</h1> 
Posted on January 30, 2012 by Cheryl D'Sa <br>

<p>CTV reports that skiing and snowboarding tops the list of winter sports 
causing injury. Every winter, more than 5,600 Canadians get seriously injured 
while on the slopes &ndash; significant, considering only 1,100 serious hockey 
injuries were reported in 2010-2011.</p> 
<p>Head injuries receive the most attention. Last year, 415 Canadians were 
hospitalized for head injuries related to winter sports. Nearly one-third of 
these occurred while skiing or snowboarding.</p> 
<p>According to the CTV report, researchers have found that children under 10 
were hospitalized most often for skiing and snowboarding injuries, followed by 
tobogganing.&nbsp;Parents should ensure that their kids are properly trained 
and wearing the proper safety equipment before hitting the slopes.</p> 
<p>When it comes to tobogganing, new research suggests that hockey helmets 
should be used as protection against head injuries. A neurosurgeon at the 
Children&rsquo;s Hospital of Eastern Ontario compared helmets designed for 
hockey, downhill skiing, and bicycling. The hockey helmet was found to offer 
the best protection for typical tobogganing speeds. Face protection is crucial 
as most of the injuries result from falling forward. A face shield can help 
prevent broken teeth, fractured noses, and eye globe injuries&nbsp;that 
are&nbsp;common to tobogganing.</p> 
<p>This research comes at a difficult time for Canadians as people nationwide 
are grieving the loss of freestyle skier Sarah Burke. A leader in her sport, 
Burke will be remembered for the legacy she left for women in freestyle skiing. 
Our sincere condolences to Burke&rsquo;s family, and the many she inspired in 
the ski community.</p>
