<p><b>MISS SKEETER'S FOUR WINTER &quot;S's&quot; - SLEDDING, SKATING, SKIING 
AND SAFETY</b></p> 
<p>So, the snow is now 12 inches deep and school is cancelled! Your mom or dad 
dress you in layers of warm, waterproof clothing to get you ready for a day of 
sledding and skating. But, be careful! Not only can the cold weather harm you, 
but accidents can occur, as well. Most outdoor accidental injuries happen 
during the winter season.</p> 
<p><b>SAFE SLEDDING&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SAFE SKATING<br>
<br>
SAFE 
SKIING/SNOW BOARDING</b></p> 
<p><b>SLIP-SLIDING TO SAFE SLEDDING</b></p> 
<p>Before you go sledding make sure that the &quot;course&quot; is safe. An 
adult should always check out the area to determine if there are any hazards. 
For instance, you don't want to sled down a hill that leads into a street or a 
wooded area! Have an adult choose an area that is clear of shrubs, trees, 
rocks, rubble and fences, and always wait for the person in front of you to get 
out of the path before you take your turn down the hill.</p> 
<p>Always make sure that your sled is in good condition. Never use a broken 
sled and do not go down the hill headfirst. There should only be one person on 
the sled at all times, so let your friend have his/her OWN TURN for safety's 
sake. An adult should always supervise any sledding, so ask your mom or dad to 
go along - they actually might have a bit of fun!</p> 
<p><b>*Important Note to Parents</b><br>
 Nearly 36,000 children under the age 
of 14 are injured in sled accidents each year. Young children are of special 
concern since their motor skills have not yet fully developed, making it harder 
to react quickly in an emergency situation. Never leave children unattended 
during these outdoor activities. If your child is too young to ride the sled 
alone, they are TOO YOUNG to go sledding (only one person should be on the sled 
at a time). Check with your local parks or recreation office for designated 
sledding areas in your town, to further ensure a safe path when sledding. </p>

<p><b>THE SAFETY &quot;1, 2, 3s&quot; OF FIGURE 8s</b></p> 
<p>The local lake has finally &quot;frozen over,&quot; so it looks like you'll 
be skating in no time. But wait! How do you know the ice is thick enough to 
skate on?</p> 
<p>The answer to this question is so important when making a decision on where 
to go skating. Of course, with an indoor rink, you don't have to worry about 
falling through the ice, but how about the pond down the road? Who checks that 
ice to make sure it is safe?</p> 
<p>Well, according to some parks and recreation experts, outdoor ponds and 
lakes need to be checked and tested by local town or county park officials 
before anyone should skate on them. A lake or pond MUST HAVE AT LEAST THREE 
INCHES of ice on top before it is safe to skate on for fun or sport. Some parks 
departments require four or more inches to consider it safe. Therefore, you 
should only skate on outdoor lakes and ponds that are taken care of by the town 
and tested each day - every couple of hours. Big signs will warn you of 
dangerous ice conditions or let you know when it is safe.</p> 
<p>So, before you grab your hockey stick or figure skates, keep these skating 
tips in mind:</p> 
<p>1.) Skate ONLY in areas designated for skating by town/park officials. If 
there are signs that warn of &quot;THIN ICE,&quot; believe them, no matter how 
cold the weather has been! Wait until the signs allow you to skate, to avoid 
any unnecessary tragedies.<br>
 2.) Just because it is cold outdoors does not 
mean the lake is frozen. It takes several days of continuous freezing weather 
to create ice thick enough to skate on, and your town officials will test and 
re-test the ice before they say it is safe enough to skate on.<br>
 3.) Skate 
at indoor facilities that are monitored by &quot;rink guards.&quot;<br>
 4.) 
Wear skates that are your size to avoid ankle and knee injuries. Skates that 
are too big or small can cause falls and other injuries.<br>
 5.) Young 
children just learning how to skate may want to wear a helmet to avoid head 
injury - a hockey or bike helmet, etc. - since falls are common. If playing 
hockey, wear protective equipment to safeguard yourself from injuries.<br>
 6.) 
Be considerate of other skaters, including those new to the ice, and try not to 
bump into others.<br>
 7.) If ice is not safe to skate on, it isn't safe to 
walk on or fish on (ice fishing) either. </p> 
<p><b>*Important Note to Parents</b><br>
 Each winter, many children are 
severely injured or even killed from falling through thin ice. Before sending 
children off to skate on outdoor lakes and ponds, check the skating signs 
yourself, or, get your skates out of the attic and go along with them. Never 
allow your children to skate or even walk on ice that is not deemed safe by 
your local town officials. Ice deemed safe by your town will ensure the safety 
of your child. </p> 
<p>BACK TO TOP</p> 
<p><b>HITTING THE SLOPES</b></p> 
<p>If you ask people what they think is the most common injury from skiing or 
snowboarding, I bet they would say a broken leg! That's because whenever people 
get hurt skiing in the movies, cartoons or television shows, they always have 
those awful casts on their leg, hobbling around on crutches. While this used to 
be the case, today's equipment is designed to protect you from broken legs.</p> 
<p>What <b>will</b> land you in the emergency room is a fall that hurts the 
muscles, tendons and ligaments in your knee, as well as breaks or sprains of 
the arms, wrists and hands. Experts say the best way to avoid these painful 
injuries is to get in shape! For instance, if your quadriceps (the muscles on 
the top part of your thighs) are strong, you have less of a chance of hurting 
your knee.</p> 
<p>Aside from being physically in shape, you really should make sure that your 
equipment is in good condition. Many ski shops or resorts offer equipment 
inspections and &quot;tune-ups,&quot; to make sure every nut and bolt is 
working properly. Bindings should be checked by a professional, and if there is 
any doubt, have them repaired or rent skis/boards until they are fixed.</p> 
<p>And, just as you protect your head when riding a bike, many professional 
skiers and snowboarders are wearing helmets when hitting the slopes. While this 
is not required yet, it can help lower the risk of head injury, should you fall 
in hard, icy conditions or lose control in wooded areas. The helmets come in 
cool colors and designs - so there really is no reason not to wear one!</p> 
<p>It is also important to know the rules of the resort/mountain at which you 
are skiing/snowboarding. Every ski area has a &quot;code,&quot; and it should 
be followed to maintain the safety and well-being of you and all the 
skiers/boarders around you. The rules may look something like this:<br>
 1.) 
Always stay in control and be able to stop.<br>
 2.) The people who are in 
front of you have the right of way on a trail. Do not block a trail.<br>
 3.) 
Observe all the rules on posted signs, like &quot;Danger! Do not ski this 
trail.&quot;<br>
 4.) Know how to safely get on and off of the ski lift.<br>
 
5.) Ski/snowboard only on marked trails and those that match your ability 
level. Advanced or &quot;black diamond&quot; trails are clearly marked, so 
beginners should be aware of them. Don't try to show off to friends by skiing 
or boarding down one of these hills, since it can lead to a serious injury. </p>
<p>These are just a few of the many rules that need to be followed when skiing 
or snowboarding. Every resort has a ski patrol to make sure everyone is 
following the rules and to aid anyone who is injured.</p> 
<p>There are also many personal safety rules that must be followed:<br>
 1.) 
Never ski/snowboard in icy conditions, since stopping will be difficult.<br>
 
2.) If you're tired, rest immediately.<br>
 3.) Wear a helmet to protect 
yourself from injury. You wear one to rollerblade and bike, why not to ski as 
well?<br>
 4.) Make sure that your equipment is the right size for you. It will 
reduce the risk of hurting yourself.<br>
 5.) Never ski down a trail that is 
too difficult for you.<br>
 6.) Be aware of frostbite and hypothermia (see the 
section on these cold weather concerns). </p> 
<p>By following all these rules, you should be able to avoid most injuries, 
however, sometimes accidents do occur. If there is an accident, most ski 
patrols follow very specific rules. Make sure you know what to do in case of an 
emergency. Many resorts have injured skiers place their skis in an 
&quot;X&quot; shape above their heads. This alerts the patrol, as well as other 
skiers, that someone is in trouble and needs immediate medical assistance.</p> 
<p>Remember that skiing and snowboarding can be exciting and fun, but make 
sure you follow the rules and use common sense when participating in these 
sports. Stay safe and warm!</p> 
<p><b>*Important Note to Parents:</b><br>
 Most ski areas offer lessons, from 
beginner to advanced courses. It is always good to have new skiers/snowboarders 
go for professional lessons, which are often offered in package deals when 
renting ski equipment at the resort/mountain. Even advanced skiers would be 
wise to &quot;brush up&quot; on their skills with occasional lessons, 
especially when going on the first trip of every season. Adults should also 
supervise children when skiing or snowboarding, especially beginners, and make 
sure that young skiers who are not able to read are familiar with trail signs 
and their color-coding to prevent going down a trail too difficult for them.
