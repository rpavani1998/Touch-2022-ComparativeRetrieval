</li> </ul> Ruka has been the fastest growing of Lapland's ski areas over the 
past decade, and is now one of Finland's major ski resorts.<br>
<br>
 Leading 
international resort planners of Ecosign, the same business responsible for 
Whistler, have worked to make the whole ski holiday experience here a seamless 
one. Planning for the new village dates back to 1999 when the resort's current 
Master Plan was first set out, with the idea of building a pedestrian village 
and moving car parking underground.<br>
<br>
 Shops and restaurants at street 
level create a village atmosphere and lodging has direct access to the ski 
slopes, with no roads to cross in most cases.<br>
<br>
 Ruka is located just 
below the Arctic Circle and close to the Russian border in the north east of 
the country.<br>
<br>
 In common with all resorts at this latitude it can be 
very cold - in to double figures below zero, although it is often warmer, 
meaning closer to zero. But thermal layers are essential including well 
insulated gloves and socks.<br>
<br>
 It can also be dark in mid-winter, with 
slopes floodlit at the ends of the day, although conversely it is very light 
once you are through the period from mid-December to mid-February. The cold 
temperatures also aid snowfall and the durability of snow once it arrives, and 
Ruka has one of the longest seasons in Europe of a resort without a glacier - 
typically from mid-October to mid-June.<br>
<br>
 As with other resorts in 
Lapland, downhill skiing and boarding are minority activities for most, with 
huge cross country ski and snowmobiling areas, plus a host of other full and 
half day activities such as dog sledding and reindeer safaris.<br>
<br>
 It 
also shares the common feature of resorts in Northern Lapland - the magical 
blue light of the area, the likelihood of seeing the still more magical 
northern lights, and a location in a pristine near-arctic wilderness with 
little human activity between you and the North Pole. 
<ul> 
<li> 
<h2>Skiing for Beginners+</h2>  A great place to experience snow sports for 
the first time, Ruka has ideal beginner terrain close to your lodging and an 
excellent English-speaking ski school.<br>
<br>
 Packages including tuition, 
rentals and lift ticket are offered, which provide very good value for money. 
</li> 
<li> 
<h2>Intermediate Skiing+</h2>  In most cases the slopes are rather uninspiring 
and rather short compared to the Alps, usually straight affairs down the gently 
rolling fells, and with less than 300m of vertical to play with. On the up side 
the cold temperatures help maintain the integrity of the snow and it's a great 
choice for early intermediates and families.<br>
<br>
 More than three quarters 
of the ski slopes are floodlit for skiing through to 7pm. Also worth note, lift 
passes here are some of the cheapest in Europe, about a third less than the 
price at most large resorts in the Alps. </li> 
<li> 
<h2>Advanced+</h2>  Opportunities for advanced skiers are limited on the 
piste, although there are steeper runs including several blacks on the north 
and west side of the area. Steepest is the 225m long Battery Run which reaches 
a pitch of 53%.<br>
<br>
 For more challenges there are mogul fields and the 
World Cup freestyle arena, or sign up with the ski school to try some off piste 
skiing through the trees. </li> 
<li> 
<h2>Snowboarding at Ruka+</h2>  Aware of the limitations of their slopes for 
regular downhillers, the Finns have been capitalising on their possibilities 
for new school snow sports.<br>
<br>
 Freestyle and boarding are both big here, 
with Ruka hosting the Freestyle World Ski Championships in 2005, as well as 
many international boarding competitions. The resort boasts three half pipes 
and a big choice of jumps, rails and boxes in the terrain park. </li> 
<li> 
<h2>Other Activities And Facilities at Ruka+</h2>  Not many people go to 
Lapland to ski in the 9am-4pm, six-days-a-week sense. Over the past decade the 
region has profited from our decreasing interest in that type of winter 
holiday, and has instead concentrated on winter sports alternatives - 
snowmobiling (600km of trails, bring your driving license), dog-sledding, 
reindeer-safaris to name a few, all available in Ruka.<br>
<br>
 More unusual 
options in the resort include the chance for a Lappish evening on the Russian 
border and Icelandic horse riding. Santa also welcomes visitors all season long.
<br> <br>
 Saunas are a big feature, virtually every property has its own, so 
you are likely to experience the two extremes of temperature during your visit.
<br> <br>
 Ruka has an excellent indoor sports centre with indoor tennis, 
squash, badminton and a golf simulator. Nearby Kuusamo (20km/13 miles) has a 
superb tropical spa swimming pool complex. </li> 
<li> 
<h2>Apres Ski And Dining Out+</h2>  Apr&egrave;s ski is usually concentrated 
on a half dozen lively night spots including the Ski Bistro and The Music Bar 
Piste, which is one of the hippest, with live bands and DJs urged on by the 
young boarder crowd.<br>
<br>
 There's a friendly, frontier town feel, and the 
Finns often party hard when they're in town, which tends to be towards the end 
of the season.<br>
<br>
 There are around 30 different choices for places to 
dine out. Expect to eat a lot of reindeer, salmon, wild mushrooms and 
loganberries, with double rations if you sign up for one of the excellent 
Lappish nights.<br>
<br>
 However, Ski Bistro serves Alpine cuisine including 
fondue and raclette, and you can also find Chinese or pizza if the mood takes 
you! </li> 
<li> 
<h2>Ski Holidays in Ruka suitable for Families+</h2>  Ruka is an exciting 
destination for families with the atmosphere of the far north combined with the 
convenience of a modern and well equipped resort. For younger children the 
Santa magic is hard to beat and older children can take part in most of the 
activities.<br>
<br>
 There is a non-ski kindergarten, Kumpare Kids, which 
accepts children aged two to seven between 9.30am and 5pm daily, although you 
will need to return to look after your children at lunchtime when cover is not 
provided.<br>
<br>
 First ski lessons are available from age five with the ski 
school and these are excellent. The Kaltiolampi Kids outdoor play area has its 
own small lift. </li> </ul>
