<b>ADIRONDACK SNOWBOARDING</b> <br>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
<h2>Snowboarding is a sport that involves descending a snow-covered slope on a 
snowboard that is attached to one's feet using a boot/binding interface. It is 
similar to skiing, but inspired by surfing and skateboarding. The sport was 
developed in the United States in the 1960s and the 1970s and became a Winter 
Olympic Sport in 1998.<br>
<br>
Styles of Snowboarding<br>
</h2>
<p>Both terrain parks and backcountry have grown in popularity with advances 
in equipment and mountaineering technology. &quot;Terrain park&quot; boarding 
is when you are snowboarding in an area marked by the resort for terrain parks. 
Terrain parks usually consist of jumps, most commonly referred to as 
&quot;kickers&quot;, rails or boxes. There are also two different ways to 
&quot;ride&quot; on a snowboard, regular style (left foot forward) and goofy 
style (right foot forward).</p>
<p><br>
<b>Freestyle</b><br>
Craig Kelly and Terje H&aring;konsen have been 
credited as two of the founding fathers of freestyle snowboarding. Craig began 
the art of freestyle, then later switched from the contest circuit to full time 
backcountry riding, filming, and photography before being killed in an 
avalanche. Terje started young, has been the subject of two movies, and 
recently achieved the world record quarterpipe air at the 2007 Arctic Open.</p>
<p>Many believe that freestyle snowboarding owes much of its form and content 
to skateboarding. Since a snowboard is attached securely to your feet, you are 
unable to perform many of the skateboard tricks, like a kickflip. With the 
recent introduction of rails into freestyle snowboarding, a closer resemblance 
to skateboarding is seen.</p>
<p>There are many different Freestyle disciplines including big air, slope 
style and the half pipe. In the big air event, competitors launch from a hill 
or ramp and perform stunts whilst in the air. They're judged on distance, 
height, difficulty of the trick and their landing. In slope style competitors 
ride down a course while performing tricks off the many jibs(rails), 
kickers(jumps), and quarter pipes.</p>
<p><br>
<b>Slope Style</b><br>
Competitors perform tricks while descending a 
course, moving around, over, across, or down obstacles. The course is full of 
obstacles include boxes, rails, jumps, jibs (includes anything the board or 
rider can slide across), and quarter pipes (a half side of a half pipe, 
although usually not as long).</p>
<p><br>
<b>Half-pipe</b><br>
The half-pipe is a semi-circular ditch or purpose 
built ramp (that is usually on a downward slope), between 12 and 21 feet deep. 
Competitors perform tricks while going from one side to the other and while in 
the air above the sides of the pipe.</p>
<p><br>
<b>Freeride</b><br>
Whether just learning to link turns or pushing the 
limits of an Alaskan descent, freeriders prefer the all mountain experience: 
open terrain, backcountry chutes, fresh powder, trees, as well as an afternoon 
spent in the park or in a freshly cut pipe. This is the realm where pros can 
show what they are really made of.</p>
<p>Freeriding is the most general style of snowboarding and has 
correspondingly versatile equipment. Like freestyle, freeride equipment uses a 
soft boot. Boards in this category are relatively longer and more directional 
in their shape. If you don't know what kind of terrain you like, or know that 
you like everything, this is your category.</p>
<p><br>
<b>Racing / Freecarve</b><br>
This often overlooked style of 
snowboarding focuses on carving and racing. Sometimes called alpine 
snowboarding, freecarving takes place on hard-pack or groomed runs and focuses 
on the ultimate carving turn. Little or no jumping takes place in this 
discipline. Freecarve equipment is comprised of a hard boot and plate binding 
system, while the boards are stiff, narrow and relatively long.</p>
<p>The racing events are slalom, giant slalom, and super G. In slalom, 
boarders race downhill through sets of gates that force extremely tight turns, 
requiring plenty of technical skill as well as speed.</p>
<p>Giant slalom uses a much longer course with gates set further apart, 
resulting in even higher speeds. Super G is the fastest of all, with speeds of 
up to 45mph.</p>
<p><b><br>
 Snowboard Cross</b><br>
In snowboard cross, several riders race 
down a track that has jumps and other hazards in the way. The winner is the 
rider that finishes first.(wikipedia)<br>
