<br>
</li> </ul> Claviere claims to be 
Italy's oldest ski centre, with more than a century of winter sports under its 
belt. Despite this long history however it has not grown much and remains a 
small, compact ski centre, albeit in a key location within one of the world's 
largest ski areas - the Milky Way Pass (or Via<br>
 Lattea to give it its 
Italian title).<br>
<br>
 Claviere is also one of Italy and Europe's highest 
traditional ski resorts making it relatively snowsure, particularly with north 
facing slopes and two thirds of the local runs covered by snow making. The 
Milky Way pass links half a dozen Italian resorts over the border that Claviere 
sits upon, to Montgenevre, the only French resort on the pass.<br>
<br>
 Most 
of the Italian resorts, including: Sauze d'Oulx, Sestriere and Sansicario were 
hosts to the majority of events at the 2006 Turin Winter Olympics, and 
benefited from investment in new lifts and many other improvements ahead of the 
games.<br>
<br>
 Claviere's significance goes back for thousands of years 
before the ski lifts were built however. Hannibal made his famous crossing of 
the Alps with elephants through the local Moncenisio pass and Julius Caesar 
also passed through in 58 B.C en route from Rome to Geneva. After his journey 
he decided to build the first road through the area which is the basis for the 
current road today. 
<ul> 
<li> 
<h2>Skiing for Beginners+</h2>  There are nursery slopes right by the resort 
centre which, thanks to its altitude, are normally open all season long. Once 
the basics are mastered there's a selection of blue runs on which to progress 
and then on to longer runs, including those served by the Coche chairlift. By 
the end of a week it is usually possible to ski over in to France.<br>
<br>
 
Learn-to-ski and learn-to-board packages including lessons, equipment and lift 
pass are available, saving time and money on buying these elements separately. 
Prices are also about a third less than in some of the larger resorts in the 
Alps. </li> 
<li> 
<h2>Intermediate Skiing+</h2>  The Milky Way gives a great feeling of 
exploration and excitement as you can ski on from one village to the next. 
Heading further in to Italy the lifts pass above Cesana, the lowest resort in 
the area, before climbing up to 2006 Olympic biathlon centre Sansicario and on 
to Sestriere or Sauze d'Oulx.<br>
<br>
 In the other direction Montgenevre in 
France is just a few kilometres away via red piste number 99 (you no longer 
need a passport to ski over the border). Most points of the Milky Way are 
accessible within a day but do check on piste/lift openings and conditions 
before you set out and be careful to leave enough time to catch the last lift 
back at the end of the day.<br>
<br>
 If you stay locally you'll find the 
majority of slopes around Claviere - more than two thirds in fact - are graded 
red/intermediate and offer descents of up to six kilometres (four miles). </li> 
<li> 
<h2>Advanced+</h2>  Although most of the terrain in the area is rated 
intermediate there are a few steep blacks and some excellent off piste 
opportunities to explore. The Col Boeuf quad accesses the high speed black back 
down in to the village.<br>
<br>
 Mountain guides will take you to any of the 
many off-piste itineraries in the area, such as the back route from 
Montgenervre via the Col de l'Alpet. Heliskiing is also popular in the area 
with several 3000m+ drop off points. Or head over to Sestriere to tackle the 
Olympic downhill runs. </li> 
<li> 
<h2>Snowboarding at Claviere+</h2>  Claviere's high speed lifts make it easy 
to get up on to the slopes where there is a lot of exciting natural freeriding 
terrain. You will have to travel a little way on your board to reach one of the 
major terrain parks on the Milky Way pass at Montgenevre or Sestriere.<br>
<br>

 Closest to home is a mini park in the Sagnalonga area. Surprisingly perhaps 
however, there is no resort on the whole circuit that aims to build a half pipe 
each winter. </li> 
<li> 
<h2>Other Activities And Facilities at Claviere+</h2>  There's not much to do 
off the slopes in Claviere besides enjoy a good meal with a nice bottle of 
wine. Along with a small selection of essential shops there is an amusement 
arcade. Outdoor alternatives include a natural ice rink, winter climbing with a 
guide and the chance to go cross-country skiing across the border in to France. 
</li> 
<li> 
<h2>Apres Ski And Dining Out+</h2>  Claviere is a small, usually quiet resort 
with about a dozen bars and restaurants, virtually all within the family run 
hotels along the main street. Normally lively venues include Disco Pub Murphy's 
Igloo and the Gallo Cedrone's karaoke bar.<br>
<br>
 For a wider selection walk 
or take a bus or taxi over to Montgenevre, a few kilometres over the border in 
to France. Dining options are similarly limited and hotel based. Gran Bouc has 
a reputation for the best food and wine in resort. </li> 
<li> 
<h2>Ski Holidays in Claviere suitable for Families+</h2>  There is no non-ski 
nursery facility provided in resort although one operator does run its own 
cr&egrave;che for children aged from six months and children's ski school from 
age four. Alternatively the local Scuola Sci Clavi&egrave;re offers lessons for 
children also from age four, and snowboarding from age seven.<br>
<br>
 Special 
all inclusive packages with tuition, lift ticket and rentals for an inclusive 
price are available. Helmet wearing for children 12 and under is obligatory in 
Italy and these can be rented locally. </li> </ul>
