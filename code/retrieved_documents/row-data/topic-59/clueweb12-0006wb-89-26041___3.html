Spring snowboarding is like a reward from Mother Nature. After a season spent 
battling the elements - cold weather, howling winds, driving snow, rain, and 
other forms of precipitation - the spring season presents a kinder, gentler 
form of snowboarding. Warmer weather, longer days and softer snow are in 
effect, as are fun events at resorts, discounted pricing on lift tickets and 
lodging, as well as great deals on snowboard equipment.
<p>Although many folks are quick to put their equipment away at the first 
signs of spring, don't follow their lead! Most resorts are open well into 
April, with deep base depths and a full slate of services still being offered. 
Spring is also a great time to take a lesson or two, as class sizes are 
generally smaller, leading to more personalized instruction. And don't worry - 
you won't forget what you learned over the summer!</p> 
<p>There are a few things that are important to remember when snowboarding 
during the spring. First, remember to layer your clothing effectively. Nothing 
ruins a day of snowboarding more than being uncomfortable, be it too warm or 
too cold. By wearing several light layers of clothing, you'll be able to easily 
shed layers throughout the day as temperatures warm up. The second thing to be 
aware of is the importance of a proper wax application on the base of your 
snowboard. Spring snow contains a high water content, which can make it 
difficult for the snowboard to slide properly. A good application of spring wax 
can easily negate this &quot;sticky effect.&quot;</p> 
<p>Once you've decided you're still up for a few more days on snow, be sure to 
check out your local resort's events page to see what's going on. Warm weather 
BBQ's, pond skimming contests, costume parades, Easter egg hunts and more are 
usually on the list, all of which present a great opportunity to kick back and 
enjoy the last few days of snow before a long summer!</p> <br>
