<ul> 
<li> 
<p> Cross-Country Skiing in the Hudson Valley -- New York&nbsp;</p></li> 
<li> 
<p>Mohonk + Minnewaska -- When a cross-country skier visits metro New York or 
northern New Jersey, the first question should be &quot;What are the snow 
conditions at Mohonk and Minnewaska?&quot;.&nbsp; seewebsite.&nbsp;</p></li> 
<li> 
<p>France -- for a holiday that combines cross-country with downhill skiing or 
backcountry ski mountaineering, the French Alps deliver. Lots of people already 
know about the incredible beauty and range of the downhill resorts and ski 
mountaineering.&nbsp; And the food. And ancient city walking areas in Annecy 
and Briancon, also interesting city walking in Grenoble, Lyon, Geneva.</p></li> 
</ul> 
<p>But the French have also applied their joy in living to their cross-country 
skiing. In the northern Alps, we like: La F&eacute;claz for wonderfully fun 
trails; Les Saisies for hillier fun trail design, views of big mountains, 
late-season snow;&nbsp; Bessans for gentle trails amidst dramatic mountains 
with late-season snow. In the Jura mountains near Geneva, we've found fun 
skating at Chapelle des Bois.&nbsp; See also:reports on skiing in France.</p> 
<ul> 
<li> 
<p>northeast Italy -- some interesting trail designs and some dramatic rock 
peaks -- see Italy stories linked fromthis page.</p></li> </ul> 
<p>But it's worth doing some advance research: The fun interesting trail 
designs are not necessarily near the dramatic views or the obvious tourist 
destinations. And there's some spectacular mountain groups which have 
cross-country ski trails nearby which do<i>not</i> have much view of those 
mountains. Perhaps the problem is that dramatic peaks are surrounded by steep 
slopes which are not appropriate for cross-country ski trails -- so might want 
to be prepared to rent snowshoes to hike to, or ride a mechnical lift up to see 
bigger views (but then also make inquiries about avalanche danger).</p> 
<p>Some of the &quot;alpine downhill&quot; ski trails (and alpine ski 
mountaineering tours) are more likely to have dramatic views than the 
cross-country ski trails -- but alpine downhill skiing (or ski mountaineering) 
requires different skills and equipment than cross-country skiing.</p> 
<ul> 
<li> 
<p> Sovereign Lake -- British Columbia, Canada (near Vernon and the Kelowna 
airport) -- notably technically interesting cross country ski trails, and 
connects to the Silver Star trail network (which also has alpine downhill 
skiing with lifts).</p></li> </ul> 
<p>Key drawback is that it's so far from any major airport.</p> 
<ul> 
<li> 
<p>Norway -- where it all started.&nbsp; I've had fun XC skiing in Oslo 
Nordmarka (great skiing just a trolley ride from downtown Oslo), Sjusjoen (
cabins), Geilo.&nbsp; Lots of skiers you meet on the trails speak English, 
though you might not guess that from the websites.&nbsp; See&nbsp;ski info - 
Story1&nbsp;</p></li> </ul> 
<p>But lots of the trails I skied in Norway did not have so many interesting 
curves + fun dips + rolls as favorite ski centers in France and Italy (though 
not so different from average trails in France + Italy). I assume there must be 
more interesting fun ski trails in Norway, so if it's important to you to ski 
that sort of style, I'd suggest do some more specific research in advance, 
rather than assuming you'll find it on the obvious trails at the obvious places.
</p> 
<p>And most of the scenery is not dramatic in the obvious way of some places 
in the Alps, so if you're looking to ski with a view of something more 
obviously dramatic than the wide spaces of the overall &quot;plateau&quot; 
environment, do some specific advance research.</p>

<ul> 
<li>Silver Star + Sovereign Lake -- British Columbia, Canada.</li> </ul> 
<blockquote> 
<p>November training site for serious North American racers, and for serious 
skiers looking for fun skiing.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>In addition to race camps, they've been holding actual elite <i>races</i> 
here before the end of November.&nbsp; Silver Star also has lift-served 
downhill skiing and snowboarding.&nbsp; Key organizational point:&nbsp; If you 
cannot get a good flight to the Kelowna airport, it's a long drive from 
anywhere else, difficult in bad weather.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>see Silver Star - Sovereign Lake &nbsp;</p> </blockquote> 
<ul> 
<li>Dachstein Glacier -- near Ramsau, in the Steiermark region of Austria.</li>
</ul> 
<blockquote> 
<p>Famous place for summer and fall skiing -- Story1 - Story2 - Story3.&nbsp; 
On the mainDachstein Glacier page, select &quot;Sommer&quot;, then 
&quot;Gletscherbahn&quot;, and &quot;Trainingszentrum&quot;).&nbsp; Also has 
lift-served downhill skiing and snowboarding.&nbsp; Nearest airport is 
Salzburg, but could also drive there from Munich.&nbsp; Note: the glacier is at 
a much higher altitude than most folks normally do their XC skiing, so it's 
worth considering how your body is going to handle acclimatization.&nbsp;</p> 
</blockquote> 
<ul> 
<li>Bend, Oregon -- fun for spring skiing.</li> </ul> 
<blockquote> 
<p>Some elite American racers sometimes train here.&nbsp; Mt Bachelor also has 
lift-served downhill skiing and snowboarding.</p> 
<p>see Mt Bachelor Cross Country - Tumalo Langlauf Club&nbsp;- race camp 
schedule.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p> </blockquote> 
<ul> 
<li>Norway</li> </ul> 
<blockquote> 
<p>A place some American racers have tried is Sognefjellet, near the 
Sognefjord.&nbsp; Note that this place is near a very large body of water, 
which influences its weather.&nbsp;&nbsp;Organizational point:&nbsp; 
Sognefjellet is a long way from Oslo, and Oslo gets little direct air service 
from North America.&nbsp;See thisski info&nbsp;</p> </blockquote> 
<ul> 
<li>Val Senales / Schnalstal -- near Kurzras in the S&uuml;dtirol (Trentino 
Alto Adige) region of northeastern Italy, just south of the Austrian border.
</li> </ul> 
<blockquote> 
<p>Autumn training site for some famous national race teams.&nbsp; Likely 
airport is Milano, but perhaps could also be reached by train and bus (or 
rental car in good conditions) from Zurich. seewebsite1 - website2 - story1</p> 
</blockquote> 
<ul> 
<li>Alaska&nbsp;</li> </ul> 
<blockquote> 
<p>Some elite American racers train around Fairbanks or Hatcher Pass in autumn 
-- but it's dark a lot then.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Some say it's better to wait until there's skiing in Anchorage -- Story1 -- 
some elite racers have trained on the Eagle Glacier in spring and summer.&nbsp;
</p> 
<p>See XC ski Alaska&nbsp;</p> </blockquote> 
<ul> 
<li>West Yellowstone, Montana (near Wyoming border)</li> </ul> 
<blockquote> 
<p>Traditional place for USA race camps in November -- Rendezvous Ski Trails - 
-Free Heel &amp; Wheel.&nbsp; Nearest airport is Bozeman, Montana -- but could 
also consider flying to Salt Lake City with the hope of doing someXC skiing 
around there between the airline flight and a long drive in darkness to or from 
West Yellowstone.&nbsp;</p> </blockquote> 
<ul> 
<li>Australia&nbsp;</li> </ul> 
<blockquote> 
<p>Gavin Watt wrote (on the rec.skiing.nordic group):&nbsp; The main Nordic 
skiing sites in Australia are the Victorian High Country Resorts of Falls Creek 
(where theKangaroo Hoppet race is held in late August), Mount Hotham (they also 
have a biathlon range), Lake Mountain and in New South Wales, Perisher 
Blue.&nbsp;&nbsp;SeeGavin Watt's website&nbsp;</p> </blockquote> 
<ul> 
<li>New Zealand&nbsp;</li> </ul> 
<blockquote> 
<p>Gavin Watt wrote (on the rec.skiing.nordic group):&nbsp; New Zealand has a 
good resort calledWaiorau Ski Farm near Queenstown on the South 
Island.&nbsp;&nbsp;SeeGavin Watt's website&nbsp;</p> </blockquote> 
<ul> 
<li>South America&nbsp;</li> </ul> 
<blockquote> 
<p>So far, the only XC skiing I've heard of is in Ushuaia in Tierra del Fuego, 
Argentina, near the southern tip of the continent.&nbsp; (My question:&nbsp; Is 
it true that Tierra del Fuego is surrounded by oceans known for furious 
weather?)&nbsp;</p> </blockquote>
