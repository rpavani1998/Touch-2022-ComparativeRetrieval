<p>Our friends Dean (above) and Marie live in Zell am See, where Dean just 
started work this season as a skiing/snowboard instructor. Dean took a 
busman&rsquo;s holiday and came snowboarding and skiing with us for the week.
</p> 
<p>We had mostly sunshine with a useful top-up of snow mid week. No great 
powder days but I managed to get back on ski&rsquo;s for the first time in 15 
years and was pleased to say that after a few reminders from Dean on technique 
I could still ski competently down those Reds &amp; Blacks. Reckon I will do 
more of a mix of snowboarding &amp; skiing in the future.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Probably one of the more interesting things we did was some X-Country 
skiing or Langlauf. Finding out info about X-Country in Zell am See in advance 
was quite difficult even with the wonders of the web. Everywhere you look 
claims over 200km of X-Country is available here but try to find out any 
specific info and blanks are quickly drawn. The tourist info in Zell &amp; 
Kaprun were only able to give us a map of the immediate area and told us, 
incorrectly, that theHiking Maps of the Austrian Alps: Grossglockner, Kaprun, 
Zell Am See (Walking Maps) did not show the x-country trails it actually has 
all the loipes marked as blue lines. BTW. I think030: Zell am See &ndash; 
Kaprun Europa Sportregion 1:30, 000 would also prove useful.</p> 
<p>Fiona managed to find plenty of cut, well maintained loipes in great 
condition to occupy her for the week doing several 20-30km days.</p> 
<p>Marie, Trevor &amp; I also wanted to give X-Country a go so we had a great 
day out with 2 hours of tution and a full days gear hire fromSkischule Maresa 
Handl, Kaprun would definitely recommend them if you are there. After our 
lesson we headed out for a 12km tour on the local tracks. We all had a great 
day and Marie seems mad keen to keep it up.</p>
