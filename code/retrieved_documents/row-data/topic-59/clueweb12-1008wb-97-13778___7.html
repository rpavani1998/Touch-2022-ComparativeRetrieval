<h1>The joy of skiing</h1>  Author:&nbsp;  Alex Lang 
<p>At that time of year when those of us with the bug for skiing and other 
snow sports set our sights on those powdery white slopes, I find the ergonomist 
in me emerging and begin to think about my hobby in a new light&hellip; I 
imagine that the seasoned ski bums and boarders amongst you will recognise the 
anecdotes. We can all appreciate the improved thermal environment provided by 
enclosed gondola lifts that you sit inside, instead of totally exposed 
&lsquo;all-weather&rsquo; chairlifts. Or the way that manual dexterity problems 
have been overcome by the installation of automated lift pass systems where an 
electronic chip in the card is detected by the machine from a distance. This 
means that you can go straight through the turnstile without having to root 
around in the wrong pocket for a swipe card. (The combination of gloved fingers 
and a slippery card often resulted in a stinging slap from the recoil of the 
elastic cord attaching the lift pass to your jacket!)</p> 
<p>And anyone who&rsquo;s ever experienced the anthropometric disaster that is 
the T-bar lift will not be sorry to see its decline! The theory was that the 
cross bar sat comfortably behind your bottom and dragged you up the mountain. 
Good plan, but they were &lsquo;designed&rsquo; for two people to ride them 
together side by side. The chances of getting someone next in the queue with a 
bottom at the same height as your own were remote to say the least. The bar was 
more likely to end up around your knees or halfway up your back. One of you 
(and often both) inevitably ended up with a face full of snow at some point of 
the journey. Still, it helped to hide the humiliation of falling off the lift 
(as it was usually in full view of the queue).</p> 
<p>But there&rsquo;s still the daily struggle to ensure that you&rsquo;re 
prepared for all weather conditions with hat, gloves, goggles, sunglasses, 
suntan lotion, lip salve, lift pass, phone, money, snack, and hipflask (most 
vital!) tucked into your numerous jacket pockets.</p> 
<p>Anyway, the big question is, should you ski or snowboard? For my part, I 
have always skied rather than snowboarded; it&rsquo;s nothing personal, just 
that I was pushed down the mountain at a young age on two planks instead of 
one. Like most skiers, I do admire the cool and effortless glide achieved by 
boarders but still I cannot bring myself to convert. I have often wondered why 
this is. I now know - snowboarding is not as ergonomically friendly as skiing!
</p> 
<p>Firstly, let&rsquo;s look at the differences in posture. The neutral, 
forward-facing stance adopted by skiers as they carve their turns down the 
mountain comes more naturally to most; it eases the burden on the joints and 
muscles, working with more natural movements. The posture of a boarder, with 
one shoulder leading the way, puts more strain on the upper body due to the 
twisted position. And having the head always turned so you can look down the 
slope, can lead to muscular fatigue in the neck.</p> 
<p>In addition to these anatomical issues, there is also the practicality of 
overcoming areas of flat piste (run outs). As we (skiers) view the run out from 
the top of the piste and negotiate the start of the schuss (skiing straight 
down) to ensure that we can gain enough speed to cover the ground, spare a 
thought for the boarders. They may have to unclip their bindings and walk, 
sometimes with one foot still attached - a very ungainly action - until a 
suitable gradient kicks in again where the board can slide on its own. Skiers 
also have extra tools to hand which can help in this situation - ski poles. 
Being able to gain momentum by pushing along is something that skiers gloat 
about as they leave the snowboarders in their wake.</p> 
<p>There are, of course, differences in the equipment for each sport too. The 
one area where snowboarding can take a point away from skiing is the design of 
the boots. Snowboarders have the luxury of soft boots, something that after a 
full day on the slopes has a lot going for it. The external hard shell of ski 
boots makes them much more difficult to walk in. This may be the determining 
factor on whether to head straight to the bar and the gluwein after your last 
run or whether to head back to the chalet for a quick change of footwear! Ski 
boots have a huge array of adjustments that help you to get just the right fit 
to transfer your weight to the right part of the ski. These include the 
pressure strap, the clips and buckles, flex adjuster and cant adjuster. 
Boarders&rsquo; boots have laces.</p> 
<p>Still, all boots now are far removed from the leather boots you had to nail 
to the wooden planks that counted for skis. Ski bindings hold your boots on the 
skis, and transfer the pressure you put on your boots to the skis, allowing you 
to control their direction. Modern skis are fitted with safety bindings so that 
the boot releases quickly from the ski when excess pressure is exerted or when 
the foot twists; ultimately helping to avoid injury when you fall. Ski bindings 
also offer good adjustability, not only to accommodate people with different 
boot sizes, but they are also set to accommodate the skier&rsquo;s weight, 
strength and skiing ability - important points if you&rsquo;re to avoid knee 
ligament injuries. Snowboards do have adjustability but it is much more 
limited, enabling users to change the angle of their feet on the board 
according to their preference but not much else. Without a quick release 
mechanism it means that snowboarders are attached to their boards until the 
bindings are manually undone - not a desirable prospect if you find yourself 
tumbling down the mountainside or sliding uncontrolled on a patch of ice. 
However, knee injuries are less common in boarders than skiers because their 
legs can&rsquo;t slide apart.</p> 
<p>The winter holiday experience has undoubtedly improved dramatically over 
the last 20 years thanks to the consideration given to the anatomical 
limitations of skiers and the subsequent effects on design of the equipment. 
It&rsquo;s just a pity that fitness and ability are then left entirely to us!
