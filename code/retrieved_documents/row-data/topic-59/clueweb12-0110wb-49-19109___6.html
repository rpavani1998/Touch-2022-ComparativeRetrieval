&rsaquo;Ski &amp; Snowboard Gear Guide <br>

<ul> 
<li></li> </ul> 
<p> Choosing the right gear is not just about deciding whether you&rsquo;re a 
skier or snowboarder! Picking the right equipment starts with basic clothing 
and goes all the way to choosing between various board and ski styles.</p>  
&nbsp; 
<h4>Ski Gear Basics</h4> 
<p>When you&rsquo;re heading up to New Zealand&rsquo;s ski areas there&rsquo;s 
one basic rule: you should dress like an onion with lots of layers! You want to 
be able to adapt to temperature and weather changes on the slopes without 
getting too cold or too hot, and so your snow clothing should consist of three 
layers. If you don't have room for bulky ski clothing in your suitcase, New 
Zealand offers a myriad of rental shops on and off the mountains.</p> 
<p>For your base layer thermal underwear is the best choice as it&rsquo;s worn 
next to the skin. Long johns might not make a fashion statement but they 
definitely keep you warm and dry. It&rsquo;s best to choose materials that draw 
moisture away such as polypropylene. Your middle layer should be fleece or 
wool, trapping warm air next to your body. Layer number three should be a 
windproof, water-repellent ski jacket. And don&rsquo;t forget those thermal 
socks to keep your feet warm. If your feet get wet and cold you&rsquo;ll 
struggle to get warm no matter how many layers you&rsquo;re wearing! Finally, 
pull on accessories to protect hands, head and eyes.</p> 
<p><strong>Head</strong> Up to 90% of body heat is lost through your head, so 
wrap up warm with a hat (with earflaps), beanie or at least a headband. 
Although helmets are advisable for everyone they are particularly important for 
ski newbies and freestylers.</p> 
<p><strong>Hands</strong> Choose waterproof, durable, padded gloves to keep 
you warm. Fleece dries quicker than wool and mittens are warmer than gloves. If 
you feel that mittens can be awkward, why not try a three-finger mitt?</p> 
<p><strong>Eyes</strong> To avoid snow blindness (and worse!) always wear 
sunglasses that filter 100% of UV rays or a ski mask. To block light at the 
sides, glasses should wrap around the face and you should always carry a spare 
pair in case you lose your good ones! Be careful: while it might seem that 
darker glasses offer more protection that&rsquo;s not necessarily the case.</p> 
<h4>Skis and Snowboards</h4> 
<p>Every ski season new skis and snowboards are developed and so you&rsquo;re 
spoilt for choice. But the massive range of ski and snowboard designs can also 
be a bit daunting. Here are a few pointers that will make your choice easier.
</p> 
<p>Firstly, think about your preferred style. Usually professionals recommend 
shorter skis and snowboards for beginners because they don&rsquo;t go too fast 
and are easier to handle. Shorter snowboards are also the plank of choice for 
freestyle riders doing a lot of tricks. Longer snowboards and skis are slightly 
more difficult to manoeuvre and are best for more aggressive riders and skiers. 
They are good for high-speed carving and suitable for a variety of conditions.
</p> 
<h4>Ski Styles Alpine Skis</h4> 
<p><strong>Alpine Skis</strong> are good for hard-groomed pistes. Precise and 
fast, their bindings securely fasten the feet at heels and toes.<br>
<strong>
Freeride Skis</strong> These planks are brilliant in tough conditions. Freeride 
Skis slice through slush and float through powder.<br>
<strong>Powderhound 
Planks</strong> The fat Powderhound Skis are designed for deep powder and 
cut-up, soft snow. They&rsquo;re perfect forheli skiing! <br>
<strong>Telemark 
Skis</strong> The binding on Telemark Skis, an increasingly popular style, 
fastens only at the toe.</p> 
<h4>Snowboard Styles</h4> 
<p><strong>Alpine or Race Boards</strong> Thin and stable with a tail almost 
flat, Alpine or Race Boards enable fast turns and high velocity.<br>
<strong>
Freeride Boards</strong> Freeride Boards are versatile semi-rigid boards, 
longer and taller than the Freestyle. Great on all types of terrain.<br>

<strong>Freestyle Boards</strong> Popular with beginners, Freestyle Boards are 
short, wide and flexible, with identical tail and nose. They&rsquo;re a good 
choice for heli snowboarding and also essential for getting air in the terrain 
park and half-pipe.</p> 
<h4>Rent or Buy Ski Gear?<strong> </strong></h4> 
<p>To see whether it&rsquo;s cheaper to rent or buy your ski gear, you have to 
figure out the cost-per-use ratio. Divide the cost of the equipment by your 
number of snow days per year &ndash; you&rsquo;ll see how long you&rsquo;ll 
need to keep your ski gear before it&rsquo;s more cost-effective than renting. 
When flying into New Zealand from overseas you&rsquo;ll have to take extra 
costs for getting your ski gear on the plane into consideration as well.</p>
