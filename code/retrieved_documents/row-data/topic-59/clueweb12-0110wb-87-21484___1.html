<h2>Keystone Transfer Times+</h2> Denver International: 1 hour and 30 minutes 
<br> : 0 minutes <br>
<br>
</li> </ul> Keystone is located 75 miles (120km) 
west of Denver and is the closest major resort to Denver's International 
airport. The resort stretches for seven miles (11km) east to west along the 
scenic Snake River and Keystone has three villages; River Run, Lakeside Village 
and The Mountain House,with skiing on three mountains.<br>
<br>
 Now owned by 
Vail resorts, it's one of the world's newer ski areas, yet to turn 40. It's 
also one of the highest, and thanks to that is amongst the first in the US to 
open each season. An area pass is available that can be used to ski at other 
Vail resorts in the area - Breckenridge, Beaver Creek and Vail itself. 
<ul> 
<li> 
<h2>Skiing for Beginners+</h2>  Beginners have special classes and a low cost 
lift ticket to use on beginner only lifts with an instructor. An unusual 
opportunity is the chance to learn to ski at night and there are also 
women-only learn to snowboard sessions.<br>
<br>
 Almost a third of Keystone's 
beginner terrain is on Dercum Mountain which was renamed in honor of Max 
Dercum, one of the founders of Keystone Resort. In 1943, Max and Edna Dercum 
moved into the historic Ski Tip Ranch and 27 years later (in 1970) eventually 
opened Keystone Ski Resort (lift tickets were $5). </li> 
<li> 
<h2>Intermediate Skiing+</h2>  There are more than 100 groomed runs at 
Keystone and more than half of Keystone's North Peak is rated difficult to 
advanced, with fast, well-groomed cruisers like Starfire and Prospector as well 
as some of the best bump runs like Ambush and Powdercap. If you can't get 
enough turns in during the daytime, Keystone boasts one of the largest night 
skiing/riding operations in the US, with 17 trails illuminated. This helps in 
its annual season opener, the 36 Hours of Keystone event, when there's 36 hours 
non-stop skiing available. </li> 
<li> 
<h2>Advanced+</h2>  For advanced skiers some of the best gladed terrain is 
located in Keystone's Outback, or for even more adventure, you can hike to the 
steeps and glades of the Windows and find your powder stashes in tree runs like 
Black Jack, Roulette or Wild Card. Keystone's wide-open glades are tree skiing 
at its best, or get on board for a guided snowcat tour to Bergman and Erickson 
bowls for untouched powder. In winter 2006-7, Keystone Resort expanded its 
terrain into the steep, north-facing powder runs of Independence Bowl. Keystone 
Adventure Tours can take you along for a guided tour of this expert terrain. 
</li> 
<li> 
<h2>Snowboarding at Keystone+</h2>  Keystone's recently expanded A51 terrain 
park, floodlit for night operations, and the A51 Incubator beginner park each 
have innovative rails and features. The resort added improved jump lines and 
new snow features last season and the parks continue to evolve. </li> 
<li> 
<h2>Other Activities And Facilities at Keystone+</h2>  Keystone provides a 
selection of free activities for guests staying in its accommodations including 
ice skating on a giant ice rink, snowshoeing, wine tasting and yoga classes. 
There's also other activities like tubing, sleigh rides, winter fishing and 
snow biking.<br>
<br>
 The Keystone Lodge recently completed its spa renovation 
with five new treatment rooms including aromatherapy tub, a Vichy shower room, 
a wet room, couples room, manicure/pedicure area, and a beautifully designed 
relaxation room.<br>
<br>
 Keystone has added approximately 300 acres of new 
hike-to and snowcat-accessed terrain (above treeline, north-facing, steeper 
terrain) in Upper Independence Bowl. </li> 
<li> 
<h2>Apres Ski And Dining Out+</h2>  Keystone has a selection of welcoming 
apr&egrave;s ski venues. The Wolf Rock Brewing Company creates handcrafted 
microbrews with daily beer specials. Another choice, the Kickapoo Tavern, is a 
completely Colorado bar and grill serving Colorado microbrews and boasting no 
less than seven big screen TVs and a great deck for apr&egrave;s ski drinks and 
dinner. Inxpot is part coffeehouse, part bar, part bookshop. You can get a 
quick nip, a classic novel or a recent bestseller here.<br>
<br>
 Keystone has 
a good range of places to eat from fast food to gourmet. Pizza on the Plaza 
serves homemade pizza at the village over a view of Keystone Lake whilst the 
Summit Seafood Company specialises in the freshest seafood you'll ever eat two 
miles above sea level, including Mahi Mahi, swordfish and freshly caught local 
trout from the Rockies. Keystone has also built a reputation for fine dining at 
the Keystone Ranch, the Alpenglow Stube and the Ski Tip. Located on Keystone's 
North Peak, The Alpenglow Stube is the highest AAA four-diamond restaurant in 
North America which you can reach by gondola for dinner. </li> 
<li> 
<h2>Ski Holidays in Keystone suitable for Families+</h2>  Keystone is a great 
choice for families with its family friendly terrain and base villages, wide 
ranging activities and programmes for all ages. Day care is available for 
babies from two months old in the Mountain House Base Area.<br>
<br>
 Besides 
normal ski school for children from age three, for the brave, Keystone offers 
'Learn with the family' classes at the Ski and Ride School called ' The Mom, 
Dad and Me' lesson. </li> </ul>
