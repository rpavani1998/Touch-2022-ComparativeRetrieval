Schedules &amp; Activities 
<p> Cross-country Skiing&nbsp;&nbsp;If you are looking for virgin snow, if you 
like spending nights up in mountain huts and enjoy traversing whole mountain 
ranges on skis, ski touring is for you.<br>
<br>
The effort of ski touring 
uphill is more than compensated by your arrival at a mountain pass or summit. 
Untouched slopes are waiting for you to ski down&#133;<br>
<br>
Choose a tour 
to suit you : From the famous Chamonix-Zermatt Haute Route to a week of 
discovering new terrain in the Queyras.Heli Skiing/Snowboarding&nbsp;&nbsp;Have 
you an insatiable appetite for virgin powder in the mountains ?<br>
<br>
Then 
try heliskiing<br>
<br>
This opens up 3700 metres of possible descent ( 2 
helidrops), in a breathtaking setting&#133;<br>
<br>
We offer heliskiing in 
Italy, in the val Veny valley just 30 minutes from Chamonix.Ice 
Climbing&nbsp;&nbsp;With the start of winter, a world comes to life which lies 
dormant for nine months of the year.<br>
When the big freeze hits, the ice 
world comes to life for a fleeting instant.<br>
The water and the cold sculpt 
incredible forms, and create the ice giants that become the climbers domain.....
<br><br>
...With the first glimmer of spring the narrow streams return, but for 
now, they are ours to conquer. With ice axes, crampons, dry tools and not a 
little innovation, the ascent of the icy monsters is an incredible feeling.<br>

<br>Come and have a taste of the ever changing world to experience something 
completely new.Mountaineering&nbsp;&nbsp;Summer mountaineering offers multiple 
possibilities. Once the mountains have lost their blanket of ice and snow, the 
rock underneath becomes more accessible.<br>
<br>
Ideal conditions allow you to 
accomplish your mountaineering dreams.<br>
Whether you would like to climb La 
Meije, Mont Blanc or the Aiguille du Midi, now is the time to go for it. We 
offer guided services to some of the most beautiful summits in the Alps. Some 
are more arduous than others but none are trivial.<br>
<br>
Your experience 
will grow with each summit climbed and peaks that seemed impossible before will 
be within your reach.<br>
<br>
Therefore, each of our courses is based on a 
mutual exchange of experience and of course training since one is not born an 
alpinist, one becomes oneRock Climbing&nbsp;&nbsp;Climbing vertical rock is 
like performing in a carefully choreographed dance.<br>
<br>
Each route is like 
a mystery that must be unraveled. As the difficulty increases, the rock becomes 
less forgiving and one must find the exact sequences of movements in order to 
reach the top.<br>
<br>
<br>
Whatever your ability level is, we will adapt our 
courses in order to best help you achieve your full potential.<br>
<br>
We 
strive to teach you the requisite skills in order to make your climbing 
adventure safe.<br>
We also offer climbs on some of today&#146;s most modern 
routes in the Oisans Massif, the Mont Blanc and the incredible limestone of the 
Aravis.<br>
<br>
Pitch after pitch, as the ground seems further and further 
away, the thrill of climbing and that of the vertical world will be at your 
fingertips.Skiing&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether you snowboard, telemark or ski, off-piste 
is the soul of all mountain riding.<br>
Instead of the tamed conditions found 
on piste, off-piste is a return to the wild....<br>
<br>
To master off-piste, 
you need to adapt your riding to the snow and terrain, and develop a feeling 
for the snow and the mountain.<br>
Rapid progression can be achieved with small 
tips that we offer.<br>
Together we can discover the glaciers of the 
Vall&eacute;e Blanche, the Grands Montets, La Grave and many more.<br>
<br>
All 
our locations offer unforgettable skiing with our main goal : to find the best 
conditions to ride each day.<br>
<br>
Just try it

<p> Do you do climbs to the summit of Mount blanc? If not, are you aware of 
anybody who does fairly cheaply? I would be part of a group of two, with both 
individuals very fit!</p> <br>
