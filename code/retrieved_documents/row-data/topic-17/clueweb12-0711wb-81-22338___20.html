 When I was a kid, I used to sit there 
smashing mosquitoes that bit me. Every time I smashed one fat with blood, I 
relished the idea that I had just killed a female mosquito who was about to lay 
thousands of eggs. And those mosquitoes would in turn breed and lay thousands 
of eggs and I had essentially just ended the lives of an infinite number of 
mosquitoes!<br>

That's pretty much TFA's point, and it's a scary one. Interest groups propogate 
faulty statistics so as to support questionable claims. Exaggeration, 
conflation, and the like does nothing more than undermine legitimate concerns. 
We've seen it with climate change - the desire to effect policy by presenting 
worst case scenario journalism has just fed the other side.<br>
 I remember 
when I got the &quot;you're a guy so try not to rape everyone&quot; speech in 
college. Good underlying point...concent is important, getting concent is 
complicated, sex under the influence is generally a bad idea. It was totally 
undermined by the 1-in-4 statistic, and the way in which it was presented, and 
ultimatly served to offend my friends and I while also instilling the seeds of 
anti-feminism (ooh those stupid fem-nazis and their crazy ideas....)in a bunch 
of guys. The stat is wrong, it's been shown to be lacking, and it's still 
repeated. It has significant utility and so it's not questioned but, ultimatly, 
it does more to harm a good cause than it does to support it. Parent Share

Which is somewhat my point. We were specifically told that 1 in 4 women would 
be raped on campus. Not 1 in 5 in her lifetime. Not with all the significant 
caveats and modifiers that precede the numbers at the CDC you've referenced 
(the 1995 numbers). Check out the2007 numbers [cdc.gov] - it&rsquo;s now 20 to 
25% either attempted or completed. The Institute of Justicefound that 
[usdoj.gov]
<blockquote> 
<p>A survey of college women found that 2.8 percent had experienced either a 
completed (1.7 percent) or an attempted (1.1 percent) rape within a 9-month 
timeframe.<br>
 13.7% of undergraduate women had been victims of at least one 
completed sexual assault since entering college: 4.7% were victims of 
physically forced sexual assault; 7.8% of women were sexually assaulted when 
they were incapacitated after voluntarily consuming drugs, alcohol or both; and 
0.6% were sexually assaulted when they were incapacitated after having been 
given a drug without their knowledge<br>
 Finally, a national-level study of 
college and community based women found that approximately 673,000 of nearly 6 
million current college women (11.5 percent) have ever been raped, and 
approximately twelve percent of these rapes were reported to law enforcement</p>
</blockquote> 
<p> I'm not questioning the underlying idea that rape is pervasive and wrong. 
What I'm getting at is that by dragging out exaggerated, faulty numbers you 
introduce weakness into an argument. Those men in that room would have been 
horrified to hear that 13.7% of women had been sexually assaulted on campus - 
but that numbers not sexy enough for widespread hyperbole. All it took was for 
one guy to do a little digging into the stats, find the body of literature that 
criticized the methodology of that one source, and campus rape became a joke to 
half the community. Instead of disgust we had widespread disdain for the claim 
itself, and that is extremely damaging.<br>
<br>
 There is something extremely 
patronising, or condescending, which presumes that people cannot be motivated 
by subtle or nuanced arguments &ndash; every problem doesn&rsquo;t have to 
directly affect 98.43% of the population to count.</p> Parent Share twitter

<p>Rape culture is the idea that our culture minimizes the damage of rape, 
marginalizes rape victims, blames the victims for being raped, and gives 
rapists the idea that they can safely get away with rape. The phrase, 
regrettably, is frequently wielded as a blunt weapon to silence criticism and 
stifle critical thinking. One might even end up with the idea that it's an 
inherently wrong idea, that we in no way have a rape culture. I'll admit, it's

<p> Of course it's a worthless statistic, that's why they use it. :)</p> 
<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; They never (and can't) account for population restrictions. 
That could include...</p> 
<p> &nbsp; Food supply. If there are too many cats, not enough food, some cats 
die of starvation. There are an abundance of natural controls at work there. 
Malnurished animals don't tend to reproduce very well. But, if there is a good 
food supply (rodents, birds, snakes, etc), they will reproduce more.</p> 
<p> &nbsp; Natural mistakes. Not every animal is born perfectly. Some are 
stillborn. Some die at only a few days or weeks old due to health problems.</p> 
<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; Illnesses. Sick animals without treatment have a lower 
chance of survival.</p> 
<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; Predators. A bunch of warm fuzzy kittens running around make 
good snacks for birds of prey. Well, also for foxes, coyotes, snakes, 
alligators, etc, etc, etc. Sometimes it doesn't have to be a predator that can 
actually eat it. I had a cat who was bitten twice by poisonous snakes. She 
could have died without medical assistance. Since she was a pet, she had 
readily available food and water. The same can't be said for feral animals.</p> 
<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; And of course we have to mention human influences. People 
taking feral cats out of the population to make fixed house pets out of them. 
Some may be trapped and sent off to the pound and subsequently euthanized. 
Others are killed through accidents, such as catastrophic intersections between 
the animal and vehicle vectors (i.e., run over).</p> 
<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; There are plenty of statistics on the likelihood of a feral 
animal surviving to maturity. That varies tremendously by their local 
environment. A stray cat in a suburban neighborhood may live very happily, as 
there are not many natural predators around (except humans). They'll also 
likely have access to food and water left outside for pets. A stray cat in a 
wooded area will have less of a chance. Sometimes the distance between the two 
is only a few miles.<br>
As with the statistics in the article, you cannot 
blindly assume either set of statistics is correct.</p> 
<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; I love statistics. They can be used to prove or disprove 
anything, and you can usually find statistics to argue both sides of the same 
issue. The statistics can be dramatically swayed by who paid for the study to 
be done.</p> Parent Share twitter facebook <br>

<p>In a nutshell, yes.</p> 
<p>Though IMHO it is a bit more than that. It's not just that people will 
believe some BS or another. It's that one piece of BS can get so circulated 
around, that it becomes basically common knowledge. It becomes something that 
&quot;everyone knows&quot;. Even people who wouldn't just believe it the first 
time, start falling for it when they hear it from 10 different sources as 
common knowledge.</p> 
<p>Plus, as they say in TFA, eventually it even gets picked by some newspaper, 
or repeated by some politician trying to support some bill, and it kinda 
becomes official.</p> 
<p>Even basically &quot;[citation needed]&quot; doesn't help there, because 
some piece of BS (with statistics or not) that's been bouncing around for 30 
years, can be a bitch to track to the actual source. Publication A cites 
official report B (see the politicians using them above,) which in turn has a 
footnote pointing at newspaper article C, which points to out-of-print book D, 
which even if you find a copy and read it, in turn points out to some study 
that's behind a paywall, and if you got even there, you find out it's really a 
meta-study quoting the numbers published in yet another article E.</p> 
<p>Most people will give up somewhere along that chain, and assume it's 
actually a valid and proven claim. Some right at the first step, because, hey, 
it does point to a source.</p> 
<p>And sometimes even if you make it all the way to the root source, you'll 
have trouble convincing anyone that that common knowledge is false. I mean, 
hey, what are you, some conspiracy theorist? Everyone knows X is true. Plus, 
supposedly some scientist said that (though usually he actually didn't, and 
some PR department or journalist mis-represented him), and who are you to 
question scientists??? You can even see that kind of idiot on Slashdot. There 
are several people around who seem to thrive on posting basically &quot;who are 
you to question TEH SCIENTISTS???&quot;</p> 
<p>And even if you got past that, you often find that</p> 
<p>A) they have the same gross misunderstanding of statistics as the 
journalists who mis-represented it in the first place, so good luck getting 
them to see why it doesn't actually say that, or</p> 
<p>B) you need to first teach them what an equivocation or amphibology fallacy 
is, before they're even equipped to understand why the study doesn't actually 
say what they think it says</p> 
<p>C) you'd need to first teach them a lot about the psychology and pitfalls 
of polling, i.e., that basically you can produce vastly different results from 
the same people and to essentially the same question, by just exploiting the 
tendency of people to say &quot;yes&quot; more than &quot;no&quot;, or pick the 
answer which sounds more agreeable, or just pick the first one more in 
multi-choice polls. Serious polling companies know and compensate for that, but 
a PR agency can deliberately exploit that to skew the results.</p> 
<p>Etc.</p> 
<p>And again, try to do that without sounding like a CT-er inventing reasons 
not to trust those guys, and without falling into &quot;tl;dr&quot; range 
either. Good luck with that.</p> 
<p>Basically at some point some falsehoods have taken off so well, that you 
don't even have to be a gullible moron to just take them for granted.</p> Parent

 I agree with you. I 
think this problem is certainly bad in IT, but even worse in drug policy. It 
seems that drugs are really, really scary things to most people and 
prohibitionists seem to love statistics and damn lies. Some great examples: the 
crack epidemic, cocaine deaths, and meth babies. Some sources:

I think I

you could breed a heck of a lot of cats from a single female ancestor in 5 
years.</p> 
<p>Lets assume that a cat can get pregnant after it's 0.75 years old (what 
i've read online says 6-9 months), that pregancy takes a quater of a year 
(seems to be an overestimate) and that each litter produces four kittens (the
