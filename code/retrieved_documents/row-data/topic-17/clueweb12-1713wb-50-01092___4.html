<h2> An Introduction To The Golden Retriever</h2> 
<p><b><i> Published</i> <i>by The Golden Retriever Club of NSW Inc.</i></b></p>
<p> This information is intended for prospective owners of Golden 
Retrievers.&nbsp; Its purpose is to help you determine if the Golden Retriever 
is the right breed for you, and if it is, how to select one.&nbsp;</p> 
<p><b> THE GOLDEN RETRIEVER</b></p> 
<p> You may be interested in a Golden Retriever for a variety of reasons:</p> 
<p> 1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A family pet.</p> 
<p> 2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A hunting dog.</p> 
<p> 3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An obedience competitor.
</p> 
<p> 4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A show dog.</p> 
<p> 5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A combination of all 
the above.</p> 
<p> Whatever your objective, YOU, as the dog owner, will be responsible for 
the care and training that will enable your Golden to fulfill its potential.</p>
<p> If you just want a watchdog, you should not get a Golden Retriever.&nbsp; 
Although its size and initial barking might deter an intruder, the typical 
Golden is adaptable, friendly to everyone, gentle (although physically active), 
and committed to carry things around in its mouth ...... including the 
intruder&#146;s flashlight.</p> 
<p> If you are a fastidious housekeeper (or live with one), you shouldn't get 
a Golden.&nbsp; Most Goldens shed their coat throughout the year, and quite 
profusely in the spring, in spite of diligent daily brushing.&nbsp; Also most 
Goldens love to get wet.&nbsp; If there is water on your property your Golden 
will be wet, and possibly muddy, a frustrating amount of the time.</p> 
<p> If you want a one man dog, prefer cats to dogs, or aren&#146;t home much, 
you shouldn't get a Golden Retriever.&nbsp; Goldens are very people orientated, 
and aren&#146;t happy as kennel dogs.</p> 
<p> Most people prefer to get a young puppy and raise it themselves.&nbsp; 
This can be very rewarding, but also time consuming and sometimes 
frustrating.&nbsp; Other people prefer a dog that is out of its puppyhood and 
has already been &#147;civilized&#148;.&nbsp; This booklet will discuss the 
pros and cons of both, and how to select a Golden Retriever of any age.</p> 
<p> Our hope is that this booklet will help you understand the Golden 
Retriever, and decide if this is the breed for you.</p> 
<p><b> WHAT IS A GOLDEN RETRIEVER</b></p> 
<p> The Golden Retriever was developed in Scotland and England in the late 
19th Century for the purpose of retrieving wild fowl on land or water.&nbsp; 
It's physical characteristics and its willing, adaptable, trainable nature make 
it suitable for many purposes.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> The Golden Retriever is a &#147;natural&#148; dog needing no surgical 
alterations to ears or tails, and no exotic grooming (as opposed to some 
terriers, poodles, etc.).&nbsp; Basic grooming for a Golden should take no more 
than 20 to 30 minutes a week.</p> 
<p> The mature male Golden is ideally 22 to 24 inches at the shoulder, and 
weighs 32 to 37 kgs.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bitches, 20 to 22 inches, and weight 27 
to 32 kgs.&nbsp; The Golden has a normal canine structure without distortions 
of leg, jaw or tail.&nbsp; The build is sturdy and muscular, but neither 
massive like a Newfoundland, nor refined like a setter.&nbsp; The temperament 
should be steady, adaptable and kind. The head is broad, with well 
proportioned, well set on ears, and a kind expression.&nbsp; The coat, which is 
one of the hallmarks of the breed, is a &#147;double coat&#148; with a thick, 
weather proof top coat, and a dense, soft undercoat.&nbsp; There are 
featherings of longer hair on the backs of the legs, on the front of the neck 
and chest, and on the tail.&nbsp; The adult coat may range in colour from a 
cream to dark gold, and the darker Golden can have a lighter feathering.&nbsp; 
A predominate colour of either white or setter red, or white markings on the 
head, feet or chest, are not desirable, but will have no affect on the 
dog&#146;s usefulness for work or companionship.&nbsp; The physical 
characteristics of the Golden Retriever are described fully in the breed 
standard, &#147;Appendix B&#148;.</p> 
<p><b> &nbsp;</b></p> 
<p><b> CHOOSING A GOLDEN RETRIEVER</b></p> 
<p> What are you looking for in a Golden Retriever?</p> 
<p> A beautiful animal</p> 
<p> A good family pet</p> 
<p> A good hunting dog</p> 
<p> A good Obedience worker</p> 
<p> There are Goldens that fit each description, and some that fit all of the 
descriptions.&nbsp; THE GOLDEN RETRIEVER CLUB OF NSW INC has members whose 
interest in the breed has led them to develop the potential of the Golden in 
each of these areas.</p> 
<p> Goldens also work as &#147;Pets as Therapy&#148;, appear in many 
commercials and advertisements, and are one of the preferred breeds of 
veterinarians.&nbsp; There is no question that the Golden is a versatile and 
remarkable breed.</p> 
<p> Before you start looking at litters of puppies, take time to learn about 
the breed.&nbsp; Attend dog shows, obedience trials or field trials, Golden 
Retriever Club of NSW Inc meetings (held monthly, on the first Tuesday, at 
7.30pm) and talk with and question Golden owners.&nbsp; They are proud of their 
dogs and are happy to share their enthusiasm.</p> 
<p> Look around.&nbsp; It&#146;s much easier to find the &#147;puppy 
farm&#148; or &#147;backyard&#148; breeder, who knows and cares little about 
the welfare of the breed, than it is to find a reputable breeders. &nbsp;Have 
patience and never buy on impulse .... all puppies are cute.&nbsp; The Golden 
Retriever Club Of NSW Inc, and other interstate breed club members can supply 
you with a list of conscientious breeders who either have, or about to have 
puppies.</p> 
<p> Read and re-read the section of this booklet on hereditary problems.&nbsp; 
You want a sound, healthy representative of the breed.</p> 
<p> Careful selection now will save heartache and money later.&nbsp; Poor 
quality puppies are produced by people who breed their pets just to have 
litter, or by profit seekers who give little thought to quality, looks or 
temperament in the puppies they produce.&nbsp; Many of these indiscriminately 
bred puppies have health problems, poor temperaments, and or breed 
disqualifications.&nbsp; Remember, you are choosing a companion for the next 10 
to 15 years.</p> 
<p><b> PRICE</b></p> 
<p> A poorly bred 6 week old puppy selling for $400 to $600 is <b>NO<i> </i>
BARGAIN!</b>&nbsp; The chances are that the parents were not tested for 
hereditary defects, that the puppies had little, if any, veterinary care, and 
that they were not given the proper socialisation and the TLC that is needed to 
raise a healthy litter of Golden Retriever puppies.&nbsp; The litter is 
probably not registered with the Royal NSW Canine Council, so you have no 
guarantee that the puppy you are thinking of buying is even a purebred golden 
retriever.</p> 
<p> You should expect to pay $950 upwards most are approx $1,000.00 for a 
sound, healthy, properly raised puppy from good parentage with ANKC (RNSWCC) 
Registration Papers, Vaccination Certificate, Microchipped and including copies 
of the parents clear Eye Certificates, Hip and Elbow Scoring Certificates and 
Heart Certificates.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><b> SEX</b></p> 
<p>  Temperamentally, there is very little difference between the male and 
female Golden Retriever.&nbsp; Neither is harder to house train, and both are 
equally intelligent and affectionate.&nbsp; Both are excellent with children, 
and both make excellent companions.&nbsp; Problems of aggressiveness which 
males of other breeds may exhibit, rarely occur in the Golden.</p> 
<p> Sex related behaviour such as mounting and marking may be exhibited by 
some male Goldens, particularly if other males are present, or if the male has 
been used at stud.&nbsp; Neutering a male before one&nbsp;(1)&nbsp;year of age 
will not only help to alleviate these problems, but will eliminate the risk of 
testicular cancer, and lower the risk of prostate cancer.&nbsp; Since there is 
no responsible reason not to spay a bitch unless she was bought specifically 
for showing or breeding, the oestrus cycle in the female need not be a 
consideration.</p> 
<p><b> CHOOSING A REPUTABLE BREEDER</b></p> 
<p> Choosing a reputable breeder is very important.&nbsp; Since it is almost 
impossible for you to know what the puppy you are buying will grow to be 
physically and emotionally, you must put your faith in the person from whom you 
are purchasing your puppy.&nbsp; There are three (3) options open to you in 
choosing this person.</p> 
<p><b> 1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Pet Shop or Dealer
</b></p> 
<p> The worst possible choice.&nbsp; It is against the RNSW Canine 
Council&#146;s and the Club&#146;s Codes of Ethics to sell puppies to pet shops 
or dealers.&nbsp; As a consequence, puppies sold through such outlets are 
likely to be poorly bred and raised.&nbsp; They are merchandise to be sold for 
a high profit.&nbsp; The high profit is the result of little thought being 
given to the breeding or the care of the puppies.&nbsp; Some may be 
sickly.&nbsp; Pet shops rely heavily on impulse buying. &nbsp;This is not the 
way to choose an addition to your family.</p> 
<p><b> 2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Backyard Breeder</b></p> 
<p> Also a poor choice.&nbsp; This is the person who owns a pet Golden and 
thinks it would be &#147;fun&#148; to have puppies, that it would be a great 
experience for the children, or that the bitch should be bred once before she 
is spayed.&nbsp; Even worse, perhaps the breeding occurred just to make 
money.&nbsp; Usually this breeder knows little about the &#147;breed 
standard&#148; or history of the breed, and still less about care.&nbsp; The 
casual breeder does not have annual eye examinations by a veterinary 
ophthalmologist, and does not submit hip and elbow x&#8209;rays for 
scoring.&nbsp; The backyard breeder is not aware of breed problems, and usually 
doesn't care.&nbsp; The backyard breeder&#146;s only goal is to produce 
puppies, and when the &#147;fun&#148; is over, sell them quickly.</p> 
<p><b> 3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Serious Hobby Breeder</b></p> 
<p> The <b>very best choice</b>.&nbsp; The serious and dedicated hobby breeder 
regards his/her dogs as even more than a hobby.&nbsp; The true enthusiast does 
not expect to make a profit.&nbsp; When someone is involved in dogs for the 
enjoyment of each individual animal, for participating in any of the many 
aspects of &#147;dog sports&#148;, and for the challenge of producing the 
finest animals possible, the result is superior.&nbsp; These breeders 
acknowledge responsibility for each and every puppy produced, and stand behind 
every dog they have bred.</p> 
<p> Unequivocally, your choice should be from the ranks of the <b>serious 
hobby breeder</b>.&nbsp; It is an interesting fact that poor quality puppies 
from pet shops and backyard breeders are often sold for the same price, and 
sometimes even more, than those purchased from the serious hobby breeder.</p> 
<p><b> <br>
 &nbsp;</b></p> 
<p><b> HOW DOES ONE RECOGNISE THE SERIOUS HOBBY BREEDER?</b></p> 
<p> Presented below is a list of requirements the breeder should meet before 
you consider purchasing a puppy.&nbsp; Don't be afraid to confront the breeder 
with these requirements.&nbsp; It is your right, and you can rest assured that 
the dedicated breeder will respond positively and with pride.</p> 
<p> The breeder should:</p> 
<p> &middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Belong to a 
Golden Retriever Club which are located in NSW, VIC, QLD, S.A., W.A. and 
Tasmania.&nbsp; The reason for this requirement is that this sort of 
participation indicates depth of involvement in the breed.&nbsp; This breeder 
is exposed to other points of view, learns more about the breed and modern 
breeding practices, and is kept up to date on Australian National Canine 
Council Rules and Regulations.</p> 
<p> &middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Be involved in 
showing his/her dogs in the breed ring, the obedience ring, retrieving trials 
or in a combination of all three.&nbsp; The reason for this requirement is that 
it means that the breeder is not breeding in a vacuum.&nbsp; The breeder who 
does not participate has no idea how good his/her dogs really are, and is 
deprived of the opportunity to share information and ideas with others.&nbsp; 
Showing dogs provides the competition which encourages breeders to produce 
better dogs.&nbsp; The breeder who competes wants to prove how good his/her 
dogs are and is putting his/her breeding program on the line.&nbsp; This 
breeder is not relying on just a pedigree to indicate quality.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> &middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Even if you do 
not want a competition animal, you deserve a pet that is the end result of a 
carefully planned litter, a puppy which received the same care as a potential 
champion.&nbsp; The breeder who competes in organised activities is known by 
others, and has a reputation to uphold.&nbsp; This breeder will be as careful 
and honest in selling you your pet puppy as in selling show stock.</p> 
<p> &middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Ask you what 
kind of dogs you have had in the past, and what happened to them; whether or 
not you have fenced yard; if the dog will be allowed to be a member of the 
family.&nbsp; Sincere breeders will be a bit hesitant to sell you a puppy until 
they know more about you,&nbsp; what you are looking for in a dog, and what 
&#147;life style&#148; you have in mind for your dog.&nbsp; They have the best 
interests of the puppy at heart, to say nothing of yours.&nbsp; Reputable 
breeders will take great pains to place puppies properly the first time 
round.&nbsp; A returned puppy is a traumatic experience for all concerned, so 
the breeder who is always willing to accept a puppy back will try to make 
certain that a Golden Retriever is the breed for you.</p> 
<p> &middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Be able to give 
you references; names of people who have purchased puppies in the past, names 
of other breeders, name of the veterinarian who provides care for the 
breeder&#146;s dogs.</p> 
<p> &middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Be able to show 
you proof that both the sire and dam of the litter have had their eyes examined 
by a ophthalmologist within the last twelve (12) months, have had their hips 
and elbows x-rayed and scored and have their hearts examined by an experienced 
specialist veterinarian.&nbsp; The breeder should also be willing to answer 
your questions about any other possible hereditary problems.</p> 
<p> &middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Be able to show 
you a clean environment, healthy, well socialised puppies, and a dam with a 
good temperament.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> &middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Provide you with 
a record of the dates and types of vaccinations, microchipping documentation 
and worming medication, a copy of a three (3) to five (5) generation pedigree, 
and ANKC registration papers.&nbsp; Most breeders register puppies on the 
ANKC&#146;s Limit Register unless you, as the new owner have negotiated the 
purchase of the puppy for exhibition and/or breeding.&nbsp; The breeder should 
explain the different categories of registration and how to register the puppy 
in your name.</p> 
<p> &middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Provide you with 
written instructions on feeding, training and care.&nbsp; Both the pedigree and 
registration document are provided by reputable breeders at NO extra charge for 
show and trial dogs.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> &middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Give you a 
period of time in which to allow you to have the puppy examined by a 
veterinarian to determine its state of health, so that both of you are assured 
as to the condition of the puppy at the time of sale.&nbsp; If a problem should 
arise, it can then be quickly resolved.</p> 
<p> &middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Make it clear 
that his/her responsibility continues long after you have taken your puppy home 
and in fact as long as the dog is alive.&nbsp; Many dedicated breeders will ask 
that the dog be returned to them, or placed with new owners who meet their 
approval if for any reason you are unable to keep the dog.&nbsp; They'll 
cheerfully be available for advice whenever needed, and can ease your way over 
many rough spots.</p> 
<p> If your breeder meets all these requirements, you are in good hands.&nbsp; 
If you find yourself with a negative response to any of these requirements, 
think twice and discuss the situation with someone else.&nbsp;DON' T be 
impulsive andDO ask questions.</p> 
<p><b> You should avoid</b>:</p> 
<p> &middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  shy, whimpering, 
tearful puppies.</p> 
<p> &middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  puppies with 
dull coats, crusty or running eyes, signs of diarrhoea, rashes or sores on 
their abdomen.</p> 
<p> &middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  signs of 
neglect, such as lack of water, pans of uneaten food, and dirty conditions.</p> 
<p> &middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a breeder who 
will sell a puppy under eight (8) weeks of age, as early separation from the 
dam and litter mates can be very detrimental both psychologically and 
physically.</p> 
<p> &middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a breeder who 
lets you handle a very young puppy, as there is a real risk of transmitting 
disease before they are vaccinated.</p> 
<p><b> PICKING A PUPPY</b></p> 
<p> Once you have found a breeder you trust, its time to think about a puppy 
again.&nbsp; Take your time.&nbsp; You might have to wait weeks, or even 
months, for the &#147;right&#148; litter to be whelped, and it can be well 
worth the wait.&nbsp; If you are fortunate, and more than one good litter is 
available at the same time in your area, you can compare puppies, pedigrees and 
parents.&nbsp; You may be asked to put a deposit of $100.00 or more on the 
puppy of your choice if the puppies are not yet eight&nbsp;(8)&nbsp;weeks 
old.&nbsp; Good litters seldom go begging, and it is not uncommon for a choice 
litter to be completely spoken for by the time the puppies are 
eight&nbsp;(8)&nbsp;weeks of age, and ready to go to their new homes.&nbsp; 
Think twice about paying a deposit if the breeder has not satisfied you on all 
the issues raised above.</p> 
<p> Be sure that the breeder knows you want the puppy for a particular purpose 
other than just a companion (such as a show prospect, obedience dog or hunting 
dog), and have the breeder help with the selection of the puppy.&nbsp; Very few 
litters have more than a few real &#147;show prospects&#148; in them, but a 
&#147;pet quality&#148; puppy from a well bred litter has all the potential for 
maturing into a sturdy, healthy Golden of proper size, appearance and 
temperament.</p> 
<p> Almost all Golden puppies are appealing, but you need to look for more 
than &#147;cuteness&quot;.&nbsp; They should be sturdy in build, with straight 
legs.&nbsp; They should feel firm and muscular, and be squirmy and active at 
first when picked up, but willing to relax and accept being held and cuddled 
for a short time.&nbsp; Coats should be clean and thick; eyes, nose and ears 
free of discharge or irritation, and the puppies should not be pot 
bellied.&nbsp; Gums should be pink, not pale.&nbsp; Dark pigment around the 
eyes, a black nose and foot pads are preferable, although this might not be 
important to you in a dog that is to be a companion only.&nbsp; White markings 
are not correct in a show or breeding animal, but do not affect the 
puppy&#146;s potential to be a very loving, intelligent and special companion 
animal.&nbsp; </p> 
<p> Golden puppies are born much lighter in colour than their final adult 
colour. The ear colour is the best indicator of the colour of a puppy&#146;s 
future adult coat.</p> 
<p> If the breeder offers you several puppies to choose from, take each of the 
puppies you are considering away from the rest of its litter mates, and observe 
its reactions to the environment and to you.&nbsp; Puppies at 
seven&nbsp;(7)&nbsp;to eight&nbsp;(8)&nbsp;weeks of age should be willing to 
explore their environment, and although a little cautious at first, they should 
investigate new objects and be fairly self assured.&nbsp; Speak to the puppy 
and see if it will follow you as you move away.&nbsp; Roll a ball or other toy 
to see if it has the instinct to watch, chase, carry and possibly even return 
to you with the ball.&nbsp; Some puppies are slower to develop the retrieving 
instinct than others, but you should not consider a puppy which does not show 
some interest in or awareness of a moving object.&nbsp; See if the puppy 
exhibits the type of personality you would want to live with.</p> 
<p> Perhaps the bold, brash puppy that never stops getting into things would 
be too much for you, and the more easy going fellow who&#146;s agreeable and a 
bit more receptive to your guidance would be a better choice.</p> 
<p> While observing the puppies, observe the dam as well.&nbsp; Any shyness or 
aggressiveness on her part is indicative of a poor temperament, and the puppies 
might inherit these undesirable traits.&nbsp; A Golden Retriever bitch should 
be watchful and patient with her puppies, and should be happy to show them to 
you.&nbsp; If the sire is available, ask to see him too.</p> 
<p><b> CONSIDERING THE OLDER DOG</b></p> 
<p> If you aren't prepared to go through the trials and training a baby puppy, 
an older puppy, or even a mature dog, can be a good alternative, especially in 
households in which the family pet may have to spend much of the day 
unsupervised.&nbsp; Goldens are very adaptable, and a Golden of any age with a 
good temperament can become a member of the family in a very short time.&nbsp; 
There are many reasons for older dogs becoming available:</p> 
<p> &sect;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  breeders often 
hold a puppy until it is old enough to determine its show or breeding potential;
</p> 
<p> &sect;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a brood bitch that 
has been bred once or twice and is to be retired;</p> 
<p> &sect;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  circumstances 
change and the breeder/owner is placing a much loved pet they have to part with;
</p> 
<p> &sect;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  the dog has been 
rescued from a dog pound or other similar situation.</p> 
<p> Usually these dogs are house broken, know many commands, and have formed 
many behaviour patterns.&nbsp; If the dog has been loved and well cared for, 
he/she will continue to give love and devotion to his/her new owners because a
properly raised Golden loves and needs People.&nbsp; Never be hesitant to take 
a good natured older dog into your home.&nbsp; Although it may be confused at 
first and cause a few problems, patience, consistency and reassurance are the 
key words.&nbsp; The dog&#146;s self confidence will return, and it will adapt 
readily to your routine.</p> 
<p> Try to find out all that you can about the older dog that you are 
considering, so that you can determine if his/her temperament is compatible 
with yours.&nbsp; Learn as much as possible about his/her habits, daily 
routine, likes and dislikes, diet and past history.&nbsp; It is important that 
all family members meet the dog before its adoption, and agree that this is the 
dog they want.</p> 
<p> It is best to acquire the dog when the household member with primary 
responsibility for the dog&#146;s care and training will be at home full time 
for the first few days.&nbsp; Time must be taken to make clear to the dog where 
it is to sleep, relieve itself, where and when it will eat, and what it can and 
cannot do in the house.&nbsp; In short, it has to learn the routine it will be 
following and what is expected of it.</p> 
<p> Give the dog a month or so to settle into its new environment, and gain 
confidence in its new owners before beginning formal obedience training.&nbsp; 
Even if the dog has had some obedience training, attending class is an 
excellent way of brushing up on its training and will help you to understand 
its responses and personality more completely.&nbsp; You&#146;ll enjoy working 
together.</p> 
<p> If you rescue a mistreated or abandoned Golden Retriever through a Golden 
Retriever Club rescue service or a Humane Society, and give it your 
affection.&nbsp; It will reward you with eternal love and gratitude.&nbsp; 
These dogs may well be of unknown background, and bring you a few more problems 
than those with a more favourable history, but the rewards can be great.</p> 
<p><b> <br>
 &nbsp;</b></p> 
<p><b> HEREDITARY PROBLEMS</b></p> 
<p> The vast majority of dogs of all breeds (as well as mixed breeds) can 
live, long healthy lives if given proper care and routine veterinary 
attention.&nbsp; However, any dog can fall victim to a wide range of acquired 
problems, just as humans can.&nbsp; Each pure breed of dog has its own 
particular hereditary problems, some minor, some impairing, and some possibly 
fatal.</p> 
<p> The Golden Retriever is no exception and unfortunately, the problems 
multiply with indiscriminate breeding.&nbsp; Failure to screen for hereditary 
problems before breeding often results in the &#147;doubling up&#148; of 
unfavourable genes, and the results are distressing for the buyer and dog 
alike.&nbsp; The following, while not all inclusive, are some of the more 
common hereditary problems that may be encountered in Goldens.</p> 
<p><b> HIP DYSPLASIA</b></p> 
<p> The term hip dysplasia means poor development in the formation of the hip 
joint, and describes a developmental disease in young dogs of many 
breeds.&nbsp; Unsound hip joints are a common problem in the larger breeds, and 
hip dysplasia can be a serious problem in any dog.</p> 
<p> Hip dysplasia is an inherited defect with a polygenic (many genes) mode of 
inheritance.&nbsp; The degree of hereditability is moderate in nature, meaning 
that the formation of the hip joints can also be modified by environmental 
factors such as poor nutrition, excessively rapid growth, and certain traumas 
during the growth period of the skeleton.&nbsp; As with any quantitative trait, 
hip joint conformation can range from good to bad, with all shades in between.
</p> 
<p> Signs of hip dysplasia cannot be detected in the newborn puppy, but 
usually appear in the rapid growth period between four&nbsp;(4)&nbsp;and 
nine&nbsp;(9)&nbsp;months of age.&nbsp; Signs of the disease can vary widely 
from slight irregularities of gait, to crippling lameness.</p> 
<p> Improvement or even apparent disappearance of lameness can occur as the 
dog matures, as a result of the joint stabilising, inflammation subsiding, and 
muscular strengthening.&nbsp; However, the dysplastic dog will usually develop 
arthritis in later life.</p> 
<p> The only accurate means of determining the condition of the hip joint is 
by x-ray examination.&nbsp; Sedation will be needed to restrain the dog so that 
a diagnostic film can be made, as positioning of the hips is of great 
importance.&nbsp; Signs of hip dysplasia found on x-ray include shallow 
sockets, irregular shape of the femoral heads, looseness of the joint, and 
degenerative joint disease or osteoarthritis.</p> 
<p> Hip dysplasia can sometimes be diagnosed by x&#8209;ray between 
six&nbsp;(6)&nbsp;and twelve&nbsp;(12)&nbsp;months of age, but this is not 
entirely reliable, and dogs intended for breeding should be x-rayed when fully 
mature in order to select for sound hips.&nbsp; Fifteen&nbsp;(15)&nbsp;to 
eighteen&nbsp;(18)&nbsp;months of age is considered to be minimum age for 
accurate x-ray determination of desirable conformation.</p> 
<p> X-rays should be submitted for scoring by the Australian Veterinary 
Association or other Australian Canine Scoring Schemes.</p> 
<p> The dysplastic dog should not be used for breeding, but may well lead a 
long, happy, useful life.&nbsp; During the acute phase of the disease, your 
veterinarian may suggest rest and supportive care.&nbsp; Moderate and regular 
exercise, control of weight, and perhaps anti-inflammatory drugs are helpful in 
the older dog.&nbsp; Many Goldens with hip dysplasia will show no outward signs 
at all, until perhaps seven&nbsp;(7)&nbsp;or eight&nbsp;(8)&nbsp;years of age 
when muscle tone decreases and arthritis and wear and tear on the joint becomes 
more noticeable.</p> 
<p> Goldens and other breeds of retrievers often seem to have high pain 
thresholds, and do not show signs of pain when other breeds might be very 
uncomfortable.&nbsp; An x&#8209;ray does not always show how your dog feels, as 
many dysplastic Goldens are completely unaware that they have a problem.</p> 
<p><b> EYE DISEASE</b></p> 
<p> Hereditary cataracts are a common hereditary eye problem in the Golden 
Retriever.&nbsp; &#147;Cataract&#148; by definition is any opacity within the 
lens of the eye.&nbsp; At least one type of hereditary cataract appears at an 
early age in affected Goldens, and while these may or may not interfere with 
the dog&#146;s vision, some do progress into severe or total loss of 
sight.&nbsp; There are also non&#8209;hereditary cataracts which sometimes 
occur, and examination by a veterinary ophthalmologist is necessary to 
determine if the cataract is or is not of concern from a genetic 
standpoint.&nbsp; If there is any question, the dog is certainly not to be 
recommended for breeding.&nbsp; A few families of Goldens carry genes for 
progressive retinal atrophy (PRA) which is progressive deterioration of the 
light receptive area (retina) of the eye, and may result in complete blindness 
at a fairly young age.&nbsp; There are also other eye defects, such as retinal 
dysplasia, that prevent consideration of a dog as a breeding animal.</p> 
<p> Eyelid and eyelash problems also occur in the breed, some with an 
hereditary basis, others are sometimes due to other factors.&nbsp; Entropion 
and ectropion is the turning in or turning out of the eyelids.&nbsp; 
Distichiasis involves eyelashes rubbing on, and irritating, the eye.&nbsp; 
Surgery may be needed to correct these problems, and while it is a fairly 
simple procedure, such dogs should not be bred with.</p> 
<p> Nuclear sclerosis, the &#147;bluish haze&#148; of the eye seen in older 
dogs, is a normal part of the age related change in the lens of the eye and is 
not a problem.&nbsp; Examination of breeding stock should be done annually, 
until at least eight&nbsp;(8)&nbsp;years of age and preferably longer, as 
hereditary eye problems can develop at varying ages.&nbsp; The examination 
should be conducted by a veterinary ophthalmologist, who has the special 
equipment and training needed to properly examine the dog&#146;s eyes.</p> 
<p><b> OTHER ORTHOPAEDIC PROBLEMS INCLUDING ELBOW DYSPLASIA</b></p> 
<p> There a number of orthopeadic problems besides hip dysplasia which may 
also occur in the growing dog.&nbsp; Among these are panosteitis, 
osteochondritis dissecans, luxated patella, and other problems.&nbsp; It is 
suspected that there may well be some hereditary disposition to such 
conditions, so even though surgery may correct some of these problems, there is 
some question whether dogs affected with any of these conditions should be 
considered for breeding.</p> 
<p> Nevertheless, when purchasing puppy, it is important to ensure that the 
parents have been screened by x-ray for elbow dysplasia.</p> 
<p><b> HEART CONDITIONS:&nbsp; SUB-AORTIC STENOSIS</b></p> 
<p> Like humans, dogs can and do suffer from heart problems.&nbsp; Of 
particular concern in the golden retriever is Sub-Aortic Stenosis (SAS), a 
condition basically caused by a faulty valve in the aorta.&nbsp; At this point 
in time SAS is regarded as an hereditary condition.&nbsp; Dogs severely 
affected by this condition may not survive puppyhood, or, if they survive early 
life, may suddenly collapse and die prematurely.&nbsp;&nbsp; When choosing a 
puppy it is important for you to know that its parents have been screened by a 
specialist veterinary practitioner for hereditary heart conditions.</p> 
<p><b> EPILEPSY</b></p> 
<p> Seizure disorders may arise from a variety of environmental factors 
including viral infections, other diseases, and trauma.&nbsp; In some cases, 
there is no ascertainable cause other than perhaps some inherent factor 
resulting in a low threshold to the stimuli setting off the seizures.&nbsp; One 
or perhaps two isolated seizures do not necessarily constitute a problem, but 
dogs subject to recurring seizures should not be bred.&nbsp; Often the 
veterinarian can recommend medication which will control the seizures, although 
medication is not always effective, and many dog owners are not always willing 
to try and live with this problem.</p> 
<p><b> BREEDING YOUR GOLDEN RETRIEVER</b></p> 
<p> Breeding is <b> not</b> for beginners.&nbsp; It is as hard to do well as 
it is easy to do.<b> UNTIL</b> you can satisfy the requirements that the 
serious hobby breeder should meet, (see the section of this booklet entitled 
&#147;Choosing a Reputable Breeder&#148;), you will be doing the breed an 
injustice if you have a litter of puppies.</p> 
<p><b>  Consider Your Motives</b></p> 
<p> If you think that:</p> 
<p><b> 1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Having Puppies Would Be Fun</b></p> 
<p> It is also very time consuming and demanding.&nbsp; By four (4) weeks of 
age a Golden litter of eight is active, dirty, noisy and potentially 
destructive.&nbsp; Illness or death of the dam or puppies can be expensive, 
emotional ..... and no fun at all.</p> 
<p><b> 2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  It Would Be 
Educational For The Children</b></p> 
<p> So would a litter of mice.&nbsp; Bitches do not whelp at your convenience, 
and the children are often in school, or in bed at the time of delivery.&nbsp; 
Care of the pregnant bitch, and properly raising and socialising puppies is 
work for a responsible adult.</p> 
<p><b> 3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  It Would Help Us 
Get Back Our Investment</b></p> 
<p> You may find that the rate of return is very low.&nbsp; Stud fee, 
veterinary fees, advertising, and the daily care and feeding of a litter is 
very expensive.&nbsp; You may be able to sell three&nbsp;(3)&nbsp;or 
four&nbsp;(4)&nbsp;puppies out of a litter of ten&nbsp;(10).&nbsp; Even 
experienced breeders sometimes have difficulty selling puppies.</p> 
<p><b> 4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  It Would Help 
Fulfill The Dogs Needs</b></p> 
<p> You are anthropomorphising.&nbsp; While the instinct for procreation is 
strong, the dog has no conscious knowledge of what it is missing, no regrets 
and no guilt feelings.&nbsp; Spaying or neutering will remove the instinct and 
the problems often associated with the desire to mate, such as wandering and 
marking.&nbsp; Pregnancy not only contributes nothing to a bitch's health, but 
sometimes causes problems.&nbsp; A spayed bitch cannot be accidentally bred, 
and will not be subject to the uterine infections that can affect older, intact 
females.</p> 
<p><b> 5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  It Will Improve The 
Bitches Temperament If She Is Bred</b></p> 
<p> You are wrong.&nbsp; No animal whose temperament needs improving should be 
bred in the first place, since temperament is most often the result of 
hereditary factors.&nbsp; And while raising a litter will not only not make an 
improvement in the dam&#146;s temperament, it will also probably result in a 
litter of unsatisfactory puppies who will be imprinted by their unstable 
dam.&nbsp; There is also the possibility that the bitch will be an 
unsatisfactory mother, necessitating much more work on your part.</p> 
<p><b>  Consider Your Resources</b></p> 
<p> Raising a litter is a demanding project.&nbsp; Do you:</p> 
<p><b> 1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Have The Facilities 
For Whelping And Raising A Litter Properly?</b></p> 
<p> You need a warm, quiet, secure area, easily cleaned, to properly confine 
and care for a litter of eight&nbsp;(8)&nbsp;fast growing puppies while they 
are with their mother, and a similar larger area for use after weaning.</p> 
<p><b> 2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Have The Time To 
Devote To This Project?</b></p> 
<p> Time to take or send a bitch for breeding, sit up for hours during 
whelping, and hand raise the litter if the bitch is unable to.&nbsp; Time to 
buy and prepare food, feed and clean up four&nbsp;(4)&nbsp;to 
five&nbsp;(5)&nbsp;times daily.&nbsp; Time to go to the veterinarian for check 
ups, inoculations, or with a sick dam or puppy.&nbsp; Time to individually 
socialise each puppy daily.&nbsp; Time to answer phone calls, talk with 
prospective buyers, and answer the same questions over and over again.&nbsp; 
Time for all the paper work required, including typing accurate pedigrees, 
health records, care instructions, records of sale, and so on.</p> 
<p><b> 3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Have The Money To 
Put Into The Project?</b></p> 
<p> Can you afford to pay the stud fee, inoculations and veterinary care for 
the bitch and puppies, as well as other expenses.&nbsp; What if the bitch has 
problems which necessitate a Caesarean section?&nbsp; What if the puppies 
die?&nbsp; What if the bitch dies, or cannot raise the puppies?&nbsp; Can you 
afford to feed and provide veterinary care 
for&nbsp;2&nbsp;or&nbsp;3&nbsp;four&nbsp;(4)&nbsp;month old puppies that 
didn&#146;t sell?&nbsp; Can you afford to refund the purchase price on a puppy 
that proves to be unsound or unsuitable?</p> 
<p><b>  Consider Your Dog&#146;s Quality</b></p> 
<p> Is your dog or bitch truly an outstanding representative of the 
breed?&nbsp; &#147;Pretty, friendly and smart&#148; is not nearly enough.</p> 
<p><b> 1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Temperament</b></p> 
<p> Your dog/bitch must be absolutely sound and stable, with a personality and 
disposition appropriate for the breed.&nbsp; Shyness, aggressiveness, 
gunshyness, lack of retrieving ability or trainability, and hyperactivity are 
all reasons not to breed, regardless of other qualities.</p> 
<p><b> 2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Breed Type And 
Quality</b></p> 
<p> Your dog/bitch must be structurally and functionally sound, with 
conformation characteristics appropriate for the breed.&nbsp; An experienced, 
knowledgeable exhibitor/breeder can assist in the evaluation of your dog&#146;s 
adherence to the breed standard.</p> 
<p><b> 3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Soundness</b></p> 
<p> Your dog/bitch should be tested free of certain genetic defects, as should 
the proposed mate.&nbsp; Knowledge of the status of parents, grandparents, 
siblings, etc., with regard to genetic testing is also desirable.&nbsp; Hips 
and elbows should be properly x&#8209;rayed and submitted for scoring.&nbsp; 
Eyes should be examined annually and be free of hereditary cataracts, central 
progressive retinal atrophy, and any eye anomaly.&nbsp; The heart should have 
been examined by a specialist veterinary practitioner and certified free of any 
abnormality.</p> 
<p><b> 4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Pedigree</b></p> 
<p> A four&nbsp;(4)&nbsp;or five&nbsp;(5)&nbsp;generation pedigree on the 
proposed litter should be read and interpreted by a person with extensive 
knowledge of the breed, and of the dogs involved.&nbsp; Titles alone are no 
guarantee of genetic value.</p> 
<p><b> 5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Health</b></p> 
<p> A breeding animal must be fully mature, in the prime of health, and in 
lean muscular condition.&nbsp; All inoculations should be up to date, and the 
animal should be free of both internal and external parasites.&nbsp; Acquired 
problems such as a narrow birth canal from previous injury, transmissible 
venereal tumour, anaemia, any disease or infection of the reproductive organs, 
concurrent diseases of other organ systems, or any contagious diseases are all 
reasons not to be bred.</p> 
<p><b>  Considerations for The Stud Dog Owner</b></p> 
<p> If you are thinking of using your male at stud, you are no less 
responsible for the quality of the litter than the owner of the brood 
bitch.&nbsp; You have an obligation to thoroughly screen every owner that 
inquires for stud service, and the bitch to be bred, the boarding and caring 
for the bitch in your care, of effecting the mating, of supplying pedigrees, 
photos and examination reports, and of keeping meticulous records.&nbsp; This 
is all done as circumstances dictate, and not at your convenience - the weekend 
away you had planned may well be spent at home looking after a visiting bitch 
instead.</p> 
<p><b>  Consider The Current Dog Population</b></p> 
<p> If at this point, you are still considering breeding your dog, visit the 
local dog pound.&nbsp; Ask how many dogs are put down monthly, and how many put 
down in the last month were Golden Retrievers.</p> 
<p><b> THE CASE FOR SPAYING AND NEUTERING</b></p> 
<p> Many reputable breeders sell their &#147;pet quality&#148; puppies with 
the agreement that the animal will be spayed or neutered.&nbsp; These puppies 
are usually sold with limited registration papers.</p> 
<p> The basic disposition and temperament of your dog will not be changed by 
removing his or her reproductive capability.&nbsp; Neutering a male can make 
him more tolerant of other males, but neither neutering or spaying him will by 
itself turn your Golden into an obese, lazy animal ...... that it is the result 
of excess food and insufficient exercise.</p> 
<p>Benefits of spaying include not having to worry about accidental breeding, 
the stress and inconvenience of confining the bitch in season, risky 
&#147;mismating shots&#148; and unwanted puppies.&nbsp; The spayed bitch will 
not develop uterine infections or tumours of the reproductive system as many 
older, unspayed bitches may do.</p> 
<p> Neutered males will not be stressed and upset by the scent of bitches in 
season, and are less tempted to wander or be distracted from their work.&nbsp; 
The neutered male will not develop testicle cancer, and the risk of prostate 
cancer is lowered.</p> 
<p> Most veterinarians like to do the spaying or neutering at a fairly young 
age (approximately six&nbsp;(6)&nbsp;months).&nbsp; It is recommended that a 
bitch be spayed before her first season, usually at 7-9 months.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> A male neutered before he learns to lift his leg, probably will not do so 
later, and will not &#147;mark&#148; his territory.</p> &nbsp;
