<p> Still &quot;thinking like a cat&quot; to figure out how to keep cats out 
of gardens, let's consider something else cats are fussy about: the texture of 
what they step on. After all, it's not for nothing we have the expression, 
&quot;pussyfooting around.&quot; I already mentioned chicken wire in this 
context onPage 1. </p> 
<p> </p> 
<h3>How to Keep Cats Out of Your Garden: No &quot;Pussyfooting Around&quot;
</h3> 
<p></p> 
<p> <b>7.</b> Cats don't like to walk on bristly material. So in mulching the 
problem bed, include something on which the refined paws of cats will fear to 
tread, such as sharp-edged pine cones.</p> 
<p> <b>8.</b> Another mulch-related idea is to use stone mulch. It may not be 
the most attractive mulch for your particular bed, but cats prefer to poop in 
loose dirt. Cats usually won't bother with an area mulched in stone. They'd 
rather be &quot;pussyfooting around&quot; where the digging's easier on their 
paws.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p> </p> 
<h3>How to Keep Cats Out of Your Garden: Striking a Compromise</h3> 
<p></p> 
<p> As in landscaping with dogs, sometimes the path of least resistance 
provides the best solution to your problem. Strike a compromise with your cat 
by planting a separate bed ofcatnip plants, in another part of the yard. Not 
all cats go nuts over catnip plants, but those who<b>do</b> may come to view 
their &quot;catnip patch&quot; as their own private sanctuary.</p> 
<p> <b>9.</b> Better still, make a sandbox just for cats and keep it in close 
proximity to the catnip plants. Chances are that the sandbox will serve as a 
magnet for cat poop. Sure, you'll have to clean up the cat poop afterwards. But 
at least you'll know where it is.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<h3>How to Keep Cats Out of Your Garden: Hi-Tech to the Rescue, Again</h3> 
<p></p> 
<p> Hi-tech approaches to keeping cats out of gardens don't stop with the 
motion-activated sprinklers mentioned on Page 1. You can also keep cats out of 
gardens using ultrasound.</p> 
<p> <b>10.</b> Ultrasound devices such as Cat Stop operate on a high 
frequency. It's inaudible to humans but unbearable for cats. Installation is 
easy. You simply situate the device so that it faces toward the garden. A 
motion sensor detects the intruder's presence, and Cat Stop then gives off its 
high-frequency sound, scaring off the cat.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<h3>Addendum 1: The Case for Cat Repellents: Why You Should Keep Cats Out of 
Gardens</h3> 
<p></p> 
<p> The concern over how to keep cats out of gardens is readily understandable 
and has nothing to do with whether or not one likes cats. Nor does it matter 
that much whether the cats in question are your own or someone else's. After 
all, it stinks to be working away cheerfully in the garden, only to end up 
stepping in cat poop! But the need for cat repellents goes beyond mere 
inconvenience. Cat poop can harbor pathogens harmful to humans. Ultimately, 
this is an issue of proper sanitation in the yard.</p> 
<p> &quot;But,&quot; you may protest, &quot;the manure of barnyard animals is 
often used by gardeners. How is cat poop different? And what if Icompost it 
first?&quot; Well, cat poop differs in one very important respect from, say, 
cow manure: the former is the product of a carnivore, not an herbivore. If your 
neighbor's cat is using your garden as a toilet, how do you know the cat's poop 
doesn't contain parasites passed on by its prey?</p> 
<p> </p> 
<h3>Addendum 2: Cat Poop in the Compost?</h3> 
<p></p> 
<p> Nor is composting cat poop recommended, unless you're an expert in the 
science ofhow to make compost. Theoretically, you could heat the pile up enough 
to kill any pathogens in the cat poop. But you'd need to be very meticulous 
about it. For most people, composting cat poop wouldn't be worth the risk.</p>
