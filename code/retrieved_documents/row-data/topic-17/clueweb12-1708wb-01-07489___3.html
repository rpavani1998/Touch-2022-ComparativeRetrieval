 Trusted pet care providers. <strong>The alternative 
to pet boarding kennels and catteries</strong> in the Bracknell area. <br>

<ul> 
<li> 
<h3>Dog Walking </h3> 
<p>Our dog walking and exercising service is available on a regular or ad-hoc 
basis. It can be tailored to meet your dogs requirements. Whilst we avoid 
walking more than 4 dogs together at a time, a solo walk option is available.
</p> </li> 
<li> 
<h3>Puppy and Elderly Dog Visits</h3> 
<p>Puppies and older dogs require regular care during the working day. We can 
provide companionship and care visits that can include house or garden 
play/care and/or a short walk from the house. For puppies this early routine 
can evolve into a full walk as the dog gets older, stronger and is socialised.
</p> </li> 
<li> 
<h3>Cat Sitting and Small Pet Care </h3> 
<p> The <em>purrrrfec</em>t alternative to catteries! Most cats prefer to stay 
at home when you are away on holiday or on business. They have their own bed, 
own surroundings and regular human contact. What could be better? We visit once 
or twice a day to see that all your cats&rsquo; needs are catered for. Not only 
that but we can keep your home safe while you are away by avoiding post 
building up at the front door. We can also water house plants, put out the bins 
and alternate curtains and lights.</p> 
<p> This service is also available for small pets such as rabbits, guinea 
pigs, gerbils, hamsters, birds and exotics. We can feed and clean according to 
your normal care routines</p> </li> 
<li> 
<h3>Dog Boarding and Pet Boarding</h3> 
<p>So much more fun than kennels! We offer a dog boarding service where your 
dog can stay in the home of one of our carefully selected, dedicated carers. 
You will be given the opportunity to meet the pet boarding carer before you go 
away and to see where your pet will be staying. When your dog stays with a 
Petpals approved family they are treated as one of the family with all the 
usual sights, sounds and smells of family life, but best of all they will 
receive all the love, cuddles, games and attention they deserve! Depending on 
the personality of your dog and subject to availability, you can choose a carer 
who has other friendly dogs of their own, or one where yours would be the only 
dog in the house.</p> </li> 
<li> 
<h3>Doggy Day Care</h3> 
<p>For dogs who really hate being left, daycare is the next best thing to 
having mum and dad at home all the time. Dogs go to the carer&rsquo;s home for 
the day to take part in normal life, and are never left for more than a couple 
of hours. This service is only suitable for dogs that mix well with others, 
since there are usually resident dogs and other doggy visitors.<br>
<br>
 This 
is a very popular service.</p> </li> 
<li> 
<h3>Pet Taxi</h3> 
<p> Petpals franchises have specially designed, pet-friendly vehicles equipped 
with cages for the safe transportation of animals. We can help with trips to 
the Vet, moving house or even to the kennel or cattery!!</p> </li> </ul>
