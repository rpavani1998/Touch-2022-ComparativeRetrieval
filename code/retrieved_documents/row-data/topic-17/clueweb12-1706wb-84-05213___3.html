I belt out:&quot; OMG-EW, gross&quot; with 
a high pitched Valley girl accent.<br>
No one expects that voice to come from a 
person like me.<br>
I also could just say something in a Jokeresque voice. 
Insane voices<br>
are always a good option.

<p>If you find out that a celebrity you admire has been cheated on by her/his 
partner, do you typically root for them to reconcile or split up? If they have 
kids together, how does that affect your opinion?</p>

Celebrities that I admire generally do not 
disclose details from their personal lives. Wait... do I admire any celebrities?

<h2>Writer's Block: Raining cats or dogs?</h2> 
<ul> 
<li>Mar. 5th, 2010 at 8:20 AM</li> </ul> <br>

<p>Do you have a decided preference between cats and dogs? Which do you 
prefer, and why? Would you consider a roommate or partner who had a contrary 
pet proclivity?</p>

 I have never liked a person who hated 
cats(I rarely meet people who hate dogs). I prefer cats,but I like dogs. I like 
the comfort cats bring along with their independence. It's great to curl up 
with a cat and read a book. I think that I like the quirky personality of cats 
the most, they're so funny. Dogs are fun because they're great activity 
partners. I don't like dogs that bark incessantly or drool, but calm and quiet 
dogs are my friend.<br>
<br>
I can see myself with six cats and a dog in the 
future. My favorite dogs are whippets.<br>
<br>
I would not want a roommate or 
partner that dislikes cats or dogs.

<p>How do you feel about human cloning? Do you think the long-term societal 
impact will be positive or negative? Why?</p>

I don't think that human cloning is 
currently ethical or useful. Many laws regarding the rights of clones would 
need to be created if human cloning were to occur. If there were a reason why 
it would be necessary I would like to hear it. I support stem cell research.

<h2>Writer's Block: Like mobile for chocolate</h2>

<p>If you had to give up either chocolate or your mobile phone forever, which 
would you sacrifice?</p>

People have existed without cell phones for 
a very long time. I am not attached to my phone, it's used for contacting 
people and nothing more. I'm not sure why this would be a difficult decision. I 
have not enjoyed a lot of the recent Writer's Block questions. Whoever asked 
those stupid vampire questions should be banned from contributing.<br>
<br>
A 
land line and email also allow a person to keep in touch with others. I use 
email more than I use my phone. I'm sort of concerned for a person who would 
give up chocolate for the use of a mobile phone.

<h2>Book update</h2> 
<ul> 
<li>Dec. 14th, 2009 at 10:47 AM</li> </ul> <br>
Book List <br>
<br>
Recently 
Read: Venus by Bova<br>
<br>
I give it a 3/5. Here's why: <br>
<br>
 I hated 
the protaganist because he was<br>
incredibly uninteresting and inept. I have 
never liked annoying rich boys with no visible talent, even if they pretend to 
have a purpose. He does not deserve anything he earns, because he does not work 
hard! A wealthy character certainly does not have to be vapid or stupid. If I 
could I would redesign this character completely. The worst part about him is 
that he succeeds where he should have failed! The only likeable character as 
one of the antagonists(Fuchs). The protaganist's transformation at the end is 
quite unbelievable.<br>
<br>
Some of the events that occur are unrealistic such 
as the irritating love interest which manifests out of nowhere(inserted for no 
reason) and the whole trip is unlikely. The storyline was vaguely interesting 
and it was often exciting. I enjoyed the decriptions of Venus, but I'm not 
certain whether the book is scientifically accurate. The message about the 
enviroment is vague at best. I am also certain that a state of the art 
spaceship would cost more than 10 billion dollars. I also did not like the fact 
that financial experts readily agreed to lend money to fund a ridiculosuly 
expensive and unlikely trip to Venus.<br>
<br>
I probably would not read this 
book again, however it certaintly captured my attention at the time. The books 
strong point is that it conjures up quite a bit of suspense and excitement. I'm 
not sure how this novel is comparable to other sci-fi. I'll give it a 3/5 for 
having a predictable ending. I had fun invisioning better endings, that would 
of course be more realistic.<br>
<br>
Read this book if you want an exciting 
story, but if you long for character development you will leave mostly 
unsatisfied. If only Fuchs eccentric character styling were used on the 
protagainst!<br>
<br>
SPOILER! scroll if you're planning on reading the book<br>
I wish that the book left me with some sort of purpose, or meaning. Is the 
message that rich playboys will succeed because they can use their fathers' 
money? His motivation is truly greed, rather than concern for his brother.<br>

<br> <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Reading Now: Mars Life (Ben Bova) So far it it 
going a bit slow, but I will finish the book.<br>
<br>
To Read: <br>
<br>
Dune 
<br> <br>
Cryptonomicon (I started this book, but never finished it due to 
school work)<br>
<br>
Catch 22 <br>
... <br>
Will I finally finish Pride and 
Predujice?

The Rarity of INTJ women <br>

<br>&quot;You know, I don't know that we are necessarily as, um, rare as people 
like to think. I think we can display differently than INTJ males, and that the 
INTJ description on a lot of sites leans toward the description of the INTJ 
male vs what an INTJ female<i>can</i> be like. For example, I wrestled with the 
whole INFJ thing because, hell, I do<i>feel</i>; I'm not some unemotional 
alien. I'm married and I have two children and I love all of them and I think 
cats are cute and I have no desire to control the world, boo hoo ha ha. And 
yes, I can give good advice. And yes, I like art and literature and writing... 
and I HATE AYN RAND! And I think Nietzsche is a pompous windbag, although he 
does say a few wise things...<br>
<br>
But I also am ridiculously in love with 
the classification of living things... and the Dewey Decimal System... and 
taking apart my kid's toys to figure out how they work...<br>
<br>
What it 
boils down to, essentially, is that I LOVE to learn about things. I LOVE to 
learn about EVERYTHING. And I love to discuss topics, not people. I don't feel 
much of a desire to help people, no matter how bastardly that sounds. I mean, 
yeah, I want people to, uh, survive and be happy and whatever, but it's not 
exactly my priority, nor is it what I would consider to be my purpose or my 
strength. And I want my children to think on their own, to feel comfortable 
with being who they are. In other words, harmony is not as important to me as 
the assertion of individuality- not that getting along and compromise isn't 
important, just not as.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
I will comment on this later... <br>

<h2>Writer's Block: So funny I forgot to laugh</h2> 
<ul> 
<li>Oct. 23rd, 2009 at 12:52 PM</li> </ul> <br>

<p>If a friend cracks a corny joke, do you force yourself to laugh politely? 
What about if it's your boss or teacher? Do you get annoyed if someone else 
pretends to be amused?</p>

I tend to smile if a joke is unfunny. I can't 
really tell whether people are truly amused or not. A corny joke can be actually
<br>funny occasionally.
