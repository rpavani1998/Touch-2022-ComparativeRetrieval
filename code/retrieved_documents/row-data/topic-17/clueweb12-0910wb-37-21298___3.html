<h2>  How do I settle in my rescue cat? </h2> 
<p>For many people there is nothing better than offering a home to an unwanted 
cat. We look at how to ensure the experience is positive for you and the cat.
</p> 
<p>There's no doubt that adopting a rescue cat can be extremely rewarding. You 
and your family gain a loving companion, while at the same time giving a cat a 
second chance of finding a happy, permanent home.</p> 
<p>It is exciting to choose your cat, get to know him and settle him in but 
there is lots to consider before you even approach your local rescue centre.</p>
<h3>Do your homework</h3> 
<p>Staff at the animal shelter will give you lots of advice as well as 
considering if your circumstances are suitable - arranging a home visit to 
check if you have room for a pet, if you are at home during the day, whether 
you go away frequently, what other pets you have and if you have children - but 
it is down to you to ensure the experience is as stress-free for your new cat 
as possible.</p> 
<p>One of the first things you should do is find out as much as you can about 
the cat's background. Claire Bessant, chief executive of the Feline Advisory 
Bureau, says: 'The more information you have on the cat and its background and 
the more you understand its personality and needs, the better. 'For example, if 
you have a dog it is useful to take on a cat that is used to dogs. Likewise, if 
you are going to keep the cat as an indoor cat, you need to ensure the one you 
choose has not previously had an outdoor lifestyle. 'It very much depends what 
you want from the cat. Do you want a confident interactive cat or are you happy 
to take on a more nervous individual because you want to give a cat a home? 
Everyone is different, but the important thing is to try to match what you want 
from a cat with the cats that are there - not just to go for the coat colour 
you like.'</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<h3>Checking in</h3> 
<p>Your new cat will need a secure room with a comfy, safe hideaway and litter 
tray en-suite. Food and water should be nearby, but some distance from the 
litter tray, and don't forget to give him some toys to play with. If you get 
off to a good start it will pay off and your relationship will blossom. Be 
patient with him as it could take weeks before he is confident enough to be in 
the same room as you.<br>
He will be naturally curious so give him time to 
adjust and with a little persuasion he'll soon be exploring his new 
kingdom.Don't forget to make sure doors and windows are closed. Block any areas 
where he could hide and get stuck, such as chimneys, behind washing machines or 
under kitchen units.</p> 
<h3>Introductions</h3> 
<p>Leave him to explore before you make any formal introductions. Rescue cats 
may not have had much human contact so could be slow to welcome affection. A 
confident and friendly cat will be more trusting than a timid cat, who may be 
cautious, fearful and even aggressive towards other pets. Approach him on his 
level and do not move suddenly as he will perceive this as threatening. Offer 
him a friendly hand and call his name. Cats Protection says allowing your cat 
to make the initial response means your relationship will probably be all the 
more satisfying. If he offers his head for you to touch, purrs and invites you 
to stroke his back, or even invites you to lift him up and stroke him, you 
could also try putting him on your lap. However, let him jump down if he's 
uncomfortable and stroke him only if he shows you his whole body or rubs 
against your legs. Keep repeating his name, sit down and let him get onto your 
lap. Some gentle grooming may help him to feel at ease but some cats just don't 
like to be picked up and this must be respected. If your cat refuses to come 
out of his hiding place, just continue to visit him, calling his name and 
encouraging him to come out.</p> 
<h3>The menu</h3> 
<p>Feeding him little and often will give you lots of opportunities to get to 
know each other. Shelter staff will tell you what your cat prefers to eat and 
feeding the diet he is familiar with will help to avoid tummy upsets. If he is 
stressed he may not eat for a few hours but don't worry, he'll let you know 
when he's hungry. And when he's comfortable with you he won't mind eating in 
your presence and his meals can be reduced to two a day. Make sure water is 
available at all times and avoid giving cow's milk as it can cause diarrhoea in 
cats because of the lactose it contains. Alternatively, why not treat him to a 
commercial cat milk!</p> 
<h3>Making friends</h3> 
<p>Once your new cat has accepted you, other members of your family can follow 
the same approach but do not leave children under five alone with him. Make 
sure youngsters understand that he is not a toy and show them how to hold him.
<br>A new cat and a resident cat will often grow to at least tolerate one 
another, says behaviourist Sarah Heath. She explains: 'In many cases they 
become firm friends but it is important to take care over the introduction 
process and allow time for their scent signals to integrate before they meet. 
When they do meet ensure this happens under careful supervision. Give them time 
to come to terms and expect some unpleasant vocalization at first. 'When they 
are together for the first time it may be sensible to have a blanket ready in 
case there is a physical confrontation - you need to be able to separate them 
without being injured by sharp claws but try to resist the temptation to 
intervene too soon. 'Ensure that your resident cat continues to feel secure in 
his home and has unchallenged access to all his important resources such as 
food and resting places. Avon Cat Rescue in Warwickshire, where there are 
between 80 and 100 cats at any one time, offers the following tips:<strong>Your 
new cat's room</strong> should be out of bounds to your resident cat. Give them 
separate beds, food, water and litter trays. Rub each cat with a separate towel 
and then place it in the other cat's area to let each cat become familiar with 
the other's smell before they meet. Do this for a week and when the cats seem 
settled you can plan their first meeting. Put your new cat in a wire mesh 
carrier and let the resident cat into the room. Don't speak or touch them but 
watch their reactions and give them both some of their favourite food as this 
will help to distract them and may also lead to pleasant associations with the 
presence of the other cat. After 20 minutes separate the cats, returning each 
to their own rooms. Try these short introductions twice a day. Increase the 
time of each introduction and use a different room each time so the new cat 
establishes a presence throughout the house. Do this for at least a week before 
letting both cats into the same room, ensuring there is an escape route. Do 
this just before feeding time and have someone else on hand so you can each 
feed one cat. Make sure each cat is on different sides of the room and give 
them a really tasty treat such as chicken. This way their attention is focused 
on the food and not on each other.</p> 
<p><strong>Remember</strong> Try not to rush things; successful introductions 
can take up to three months.</p> 
<h3>Introducing dogs</h3> 
<p>It is also possible for your new cat to get along with your resident dog 
without too many problems. However, meetings should be supervised and your dog 
should be on a lead.<strong>Following these steps should help:</strong> Place 
the cat in a large indoor kennel or separate the cat and dog with a child-gate, 
giving the dog immediate access to investigate the cat. (If the cat is in an 
indoor kennel it is important that he has a place to hide in if he feels 
threatened. Don't talk, touch or give eye contact to the dog. If the dog is 
behaving well (not growling, barking or focusing on the cat) let them continue 
to get to know one another. Call the dog and wait for him to come back and stay 
with you for at least ten seconds then reward him for staying with you. Repeat 
these steps a couple of times a day for the first few days. When they are 
relaxed with each other they can meet without the use of the gate or kennel but 
the dog should still be on a lead. Try not to reinforce your dog's behaviour. 
If you talk to, touch or reassure the cat or dog, or hold a tight lead, you'll 
increase the dog's interest in the cat and encourage his chase instinct. The 
dog will also learn that he can get your attention by showing interest in the 
cat.</p> 
<h3>The great outdoors</h3> 
<p>Once he's been introduced to everyone you can let your cat explore the rest 
of the house, making sure he can't escape. Keep him in for at least three to 
four weeks but let him see outside so he can familiarize himself with his 
surroundings. You can then encourage him outside into your garden. Start by 
letting him out just before dinner time, making sure the route back to the 
house can be seen and is away from the danger of traffic. Don't worry, he'll 
find his way back - especially if he's hungry!</p> 
<h3>Keeping track</h3> 
<p>Don't forget to make sure your rescue cat is micro-chipped and if he is 
making sure your contact details are logged. Pettrac, part of the AVID Global 
Recovery System, is one of three main databases in the UK that could hold your 
details. If your pet has an AVID microchip contact AVID Plc, PO Box 19, 
Uckfield, East Sussex TN22 3TF or visit www.avidplc.com If your details have 
changed tel: 0800 652 8977 or to report your pet lost or found 24 hours a day 
tel: 0800 652 9977.</p>
