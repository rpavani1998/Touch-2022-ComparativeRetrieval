<h3> Rosie's rescue of the week - Lizzie </h3> <br>
Meet Lizzie, a female 
black shorthair approximately 5 years old. Lizzie is spayed, up to date on 
shots, and housetrained. She would prefer a home without other cats and dogs, 
but is very affectionate and will wrap her paws around your neck and give you a 
hug when picked up. For more information on adopting Lizzie,click here. <br>

<br> Lizzie was left behind when her owners moved away, and is currently being 
cared for byMaumee Valley Save a Pet in Toledo, Ohio. They routinely donate 
spaying and neutering services to Humane Ohio, an organization that provides 
pet care services to people who cannot afford vet care for their pets. They 
like so many charitable organizations are always in need of funding to keep 
going, and I have entered them to win $1,000 in a giveaway sponsored by 
Discount Pet Medication.net. If you have a minute, could you give them a vote 
over on my far right sidebar or byclicking here, or if you have a pet charity 
near and dear to you, you can also enter them in the drawing. Thank you all for 
your time and attention to this good cause.<br>

<p> Lizzie is beautiful...Oh my word I cannot imagine any situation that would 
make me leave Madi behind. She is a member of our family.<br>
Hopefully Lizzie 
will find a new family of 2 leggers who aren't fickled and stoopid!!<br>

<p> Lizzie is very beautiful and reminds me of my beloved kitty Panther who I 
miss very much. I hope she finds a loving furever home!</p> </dd>

<p> Hi Madi and Mom,<br>
Yes, isn't Lizzie a beautiful girl! I was sickened to 
read how she came to be at the shelter too-it didn't relly say if the family 
dropped her at the shelter or if they just abandoned her and she was found - 
hopefully the first one. My girls are members of our family too and I could 
never do that.</p> </dd>

<p> Hi Catherine,<br>
Thanks so much! I only wish I could do more financially 
to help all the lost furry soles out there. And we hope you had a wonderful 
birthday.</p> </dd>

<p> Hi Beaded Tail,<br>
thanks for dropping by. Panther must have been a 
gorgeous girl if she looked like Lizzie. I too had an all black cat named 
&quot;Kitty&quot; who lived to be 17 years old. Then Gidget and Jackie came to 
live with us 11 years ago, followed by Lola. I just love black cats and don't 
understand why they tend to be the last ones adopted from shelters.</p> </dd>

<p> Oh Lizzie, you are so darn pretty. Wish we had room at our inn here for 
you. We sure hope you find a forever home really soon. How could anyone turn 
you down. Good luck to you.</p> </dd>

 &quot;Thousands of years ago, cats were treated as 
royalty. Cats have never forgotten this.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;In a perfect 
world, every dog would have a home and every home would have a dog.&quot;<br>
