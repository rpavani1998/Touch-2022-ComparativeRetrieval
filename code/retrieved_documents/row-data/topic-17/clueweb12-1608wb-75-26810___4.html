<h1>Cats Vs. Dogs &ndash; Who&rsquo;s Liked More?</h1>  Posted in Human-Animal 
Bond, Just For Fun <br>

<p>A recent Associated Press poll reveals that more people like dogs than like 
cats.&nbsp; In a survey of just under 2000 people, 59% of who were pet owners 
(mostly of dogs or cats) 74% said they liked dogs &ldquo;a lot&rdquo; but only 
41% said the same thing about cats.&nbsp; Only 2% said they disliked dogs 
&ldquo;a lot&rdquo;, but 15% feel that way about cats.</p> 
<p>The people surveyed explained their opinions with comments such as dogs are 
more loyal, cats only care about themselves, dogs want to please their owners, 
and cats are &ldquo;1,000 times&rdquo; smarter than dogs.</p> 
<p>What might be some reasons for this difference between our perceptions of 
dogs versus cats?&nbsp; There are many possibilities.&nbsp;</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Looking at the domestication history of the two species, the latest 
thinking is that dogs were for the most part wanted for companionship (less 
likely as a cooperative hunting partner as had been previously thought).&nbsp; 
After an initial stage of being a religious symbol and appreciated for their 
predatory behaviors that kept rodents out of food stores, cats went through a 
dark period of being associated with witches and witchcraft that has, 
unfortunately, never completely left them.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Second, there is no doubt that the social organization and communicative 
behaviors of dogs are much more similar to ours than are those of cats.&nbsp; 
We can more easily relate to the appeasement/submissive behaviors of dogs for 
example (even though we sometimes mistakenly assign &ldquo;guilt&rdquo; and 
other human motivations to them) and the more family like structure of a group 
of wolves than we can the more solitary life of many cats.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>These differences in social structure lead us to believe, as reflected in 
the comment from a poll participant that dogs are &ldquo;eager to 
please&rdquo;.&nbsp; This is a misleading conclusion.&nbsp; More accurately, 
dogs are more likely to be motivated by social rewards and punishers.&nbsp; As 
a general rule, dogs will respond more to petting and verbal praise; angry 
voices and threatening gestures than do cats.&nbsp; But even this 
generalization may not bear up under scrutiny.&nbsp; Consider the breeds with 
reputations for being aloof &ndash; such as Basenjis and Akitas, and compare 
that with many orange tabby male cats, who also have reputations for being 
extremely sociable &ndash; our late, great Buffett being one.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>And when it comes to &ldquo;intelligence&rdquo;, or the question of who is 
smarter, it all depends on the methods used to measure it.&nbsp; So it's hard 
to make a claim for the superiority of&nbsp;cat versus dog or vice&nbsp;versa. 
&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Cat lovers shouldn&rsquo;t be too discouraged.&nbsp; The survey also found 
that 60% of adult said they liked both cats and dogs.&nbsp; What&rsquo;s 
unfortunate about this survey is that the data from non-pet owners 
weren&rsquo;t reported separately.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As a cat lover who once trained a mongrel from a dog pound thoroughly 
enough for her to pass the AKC &ldquo;Companion Dog&rdquo; obedience test, I 
would like it very much if the internecine &ldquo;dog versus cat&rdquo; war 
would cease. If the Catholics and Protestants in northern Ireland can give it a 
rest, then so can American dog and cat owners. I prefer cats, but enjoy the 
occasional company of well-behaved dogs. After ten straight hours of 
copyediting, good luck getting your cat to go out in the yard with you and 
chase a frisbee, to blow off some steam. Mind you, the cat will stay by your 
side the whole time you&rsquo;re at your desk, displaying her beauty and 
otherwise implicitly urging you on. To borrow from that disgusting movie 
&ldquo;Pulp Fiction,&rdquo; one can love the Beatles, and like Elvis.</p> </li>
