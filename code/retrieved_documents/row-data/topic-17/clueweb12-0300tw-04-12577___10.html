<p>Our pet dogs are descendent's of the wolf family, who, when living in the 
wild,&nbsp;are able to keep&nbsp;their claws naturally short due to all of the 
wear and tear they get moving over different textures of ground. However, our 
pet dogs can't always keep their claws short enough for comfort. This is 
because many of our dogs live indoors with us where the floors are soft and 
carpeted.</p> <br>

<p>Left unsupervised a dogs claws can become extremely long and painful, even 
curling in on themselves and digging into the soft pads of&nbsp;a dogs paws.</p>
<p>As claws become uncomfortably long,&nbsp;dogs are unable to help 
themselves, or explain what the problem is to their owners. Some dogs begin a 
cycle of chewing their paws out of frustration, or because they recognise they 
are having trouble in this area, but don't know how to fix it themselves.</p> 
<p>If your dogs claws need clipping you may decide to do this yourself. 
This&nbsp;could be because your dog is fearful of visiting a veterinarian. Or 
it may be because the cost of having a professional carry out the task is a 
little too steep for you.</p> 
<p>Some dogs are happy to have their claws clipped, while others are afraid 
and so struggle, or worse nibble the hand which tries to help them. If you have 
never carried out this procedure, reserve a little caution to 
ascertain&nbsp;your dogs&nbsp;reaction and respond in the best possible way to 
suit you both.</p> 
<p>It is easiest to have two of you trim your dogs nails, but it is still 
possible if you are alone, and just takes some practice. To instill confidence 
in your dog be gentle, but firm at the same time, using positive movements and 
handling his or her paws in a positive manner.</p> 
<p>It is best, where possible, to get your dog to lay on his or her back, 
belly up towards you, rather than laying the other way around. If&nbsp;the dog 
is small enough, you can hold him or her in your arms like a baby.</p> 
<p>When a dog displays fearful behaviour, and there is the possibility of 
being bitten, you may be wise to apply a muzzle to your dog to prevent any 
mishap.</p> 
<p>As you look at the&nbsp;nails you will notice there's a line running down 
the center of each one. This is the nerve ending which has in it a blood 
supply. If you accidentally cut one of these, it will be painful for your dog 
and difficult to stop the bleeding. The fastest way to prevent blood flow, if 
the worst happens,&nbsp;is to use a very soft bar of soap. Carefully push the 
soap onto the bleeding nail, and it should stop pretty quickly compared to 
applying powder or dabbing it with cotton wool.</p> 
<p>The sort of clippers&nbsp;to use&nbsp;are those&nbsp;which are designed 
especially for cutting dogs claws. Clippers which are designed for humans 
nails&nbsp;are not a good idea. They are rarely tough enough and are the wrong 
shape for claws. You can purchase the correct type of clippers from a 
veterinary surgery, or from a pet store, and it is well worth doing so.</p> 
<p>Before you cut your dogs&nbsp;nails, hold his or her paw firmly so that 
there is no movement and less chance of a mistake being made. Cut across the 
nail, just once, minding not to clip into the nerve, but have your soft soap 
ready just in-case.</p> 
<p>Once you have done this a few times your dog will get used to the procedure 
and know what to expect, becomming easier to handle. To make it a pleasant 
experience for him or her, offer a tasty treat as compensation for going 
through the ordeal. This way&nbsp;an association will be made 
between&nbsp;having a treat and nails clipped.</p>
