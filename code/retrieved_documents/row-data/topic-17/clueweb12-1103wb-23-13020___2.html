Cats or dogs: What's your 
preference? <br>
The lowdown on which species veterinarians and veterinary team 
members prefer to work with, why&mdash;and if it matters. <br>

 Conventional wisdom holds that 
when it comes to the veterinary business, it&rsquo;s a dog&rsquo;s world. 
Meaning that the majority of veterinarians and their staff prefer to work with 
dogs over cats. (Visitdvm360.com/catsvsdogs to read colleagues&rsquo; reasons 
for why that is.) But how accurate is that belief? And if true, what does it 
mean for your clients and patients?<br>

 Not according to Dr. Gary Norsworthy, DABVP, a San Antonio-based 
feline practitioner. &ldquo;You need to work with the species that you feel 
most comfortable with,&rdquo; he says. Doing so will not only make your own 
work more enjoyable, it will also better serve your clients and patients.<br>

<br> Canine and feline practice varies significantly, Dr. Norsworthy says, from 
restraint methods to understanding and treating disease. &ldquo;Even diseases 
with the same name will behave differently in dogs and cats,&rdquo; he says. 
When you focus on one species, you develop a better set of skills for treating 
that group. Plus, clients will appreciate your devotion.<br>
<br>
 So go ahead 
and stake your claim as the dog whisperer or the go-to cat guru at your 
practice if you prefer working with one species over the other. But avoid being 
pigeonholed in that role or labeled as a dog hater or cat hater. Just because 
you prefer to work with one species over another right now doesn&rsquo;t mean 
you always will or that you dislike the other species. And you might not always 
have the option.<br>

<b>Cats may be beginning to gain ground</b> <br>

<br>
 
&ldquo;When I graduated from Texas A&amp;M in 1972, most of my classmates came 
from a rural background where cats were barn creatures and largely disposable. 
My colleagues couldn&rsquo;t justify spending money on a cat because they could 
get a dozen more, and many took that attitude in practice.<br>
<br>
 But over 
time, a new generation of veterinarians came into the profession. They were 
more positive toward cats, probably because they had urban backgrounds and grew 
up with cats in their households. You can see the shift. When I graduated, 
there were three feline-only practices in the country. Now there are more than 
300.&rdquo; &mdash;Dr. Gary Norsworthy, DABVP<br>
