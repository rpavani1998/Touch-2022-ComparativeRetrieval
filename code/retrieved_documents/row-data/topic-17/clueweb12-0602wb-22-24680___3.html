<b>Cats and Rabbits </b><br>
<b><i>Amy Shapiro</i></b><br>

<i>A cat and a rabbit really can be friends.</i>
<p>Yes, really. What seems an unlikely combination, given the predator-prey 
context that first comes to mind, is in fact a common and often rewarding 
match. The key is to remove that stereotype from your mind and, more 
importantly, from the environment. In an earlier issue we described some of the 
friendships that have developed between these two. Now we offer ideas on 
introducing cats and rabbits in ways that minimize stress for all concerned.</p>
<p></p>
<h4>BASIC INSTINCT WITH VARIATION</h4>A cat who lives with a house rabbit 
might still stalk and chase a rabbit he met outdoors. The environmental cues 
would set the instinct in motion. In fact, he might even pursue his own 
rabbit-friend if they encountered each other outdoors. There are two lessons 
here. The first is to make sure you set up a situation where Felix is unlikely 
to feel predatory. The second is that even if Daphne has a feline friend, she 
could still be terrorized by an unfamiliar cat.
<p>Many people report a total reversal of the expected roles between 
house-rabbit and house-cat. Daphne takes charge, bossing Felix, chasing him and 
generally throwing her weight around. Rabbits tend to be much more 
confrontational in social situations than are cats. I believe this is because, 
at a very basic level, rabbits are group animals and cats are solitary. 
Daphne's instincts tell her, &quot;Here's someone in my territory. We need to 
figure out who's who in the social hierarchy.&quot; Felix, on the other hand, 
is thinking, &quot;Hmm. A large furry creature who isn't running away from me. 
Why look for trouble?&quot; Fundamentally social or pack animals such as 
rabbits, dogs, and humans are much more concerned with hierarchy-with who's in 
charge, who's top dog-than animals who are programmed to live on their own. 
Domestication has modified these instincts in the cat to the point that most 
domestic cats prefer to live with at least one feline companion. And of course 
there is a great deal of individual variation within species, from the human 
hermit to the gregarious cat. There are also animals who seem to prefer the 
companionship of species other than their own. Many rabbits who lack the social 
skills necessary for living with another rabbit do much better with a feline 
companion.</p>
<p></p>
<h4>LITTLE BUNNY, BIG CAT</h4>But what happens if the rabbit does run from the 
cat? Here's where environmental manipulation (the human's job) comes in. If 
Daphne runs, then the cat's instincts tell him something very different than 
the laid-back, confrontation-avoiding stance he generally takes to social 
situations. Cats play only one game, and it's called hunting. All that adorable 
behavior with the catnip mouse and the feather-at-the-end-of-a-string is 
basically Stalk, Capture, and Deliver the Fatal Bite.Probably the most 
difficult cat/rabbit introduction is between a shy and/or small rabbit and an 
adolescent cat whose claws haven't been trimmed recently. In this or any 
situation where the cat chases, the initial acquaintance should take place with 
Daphne safely in her cage. Make sure that the wire is small enough that Felix 
can't stick his foot through it. Also give Daphne a hiding place within the 
cage, such as a cardboard box (this is a good general policy for all rabbits, 
especially shy ones, even in catless homes). Actually, any cat who interacts 
with a rabbit, regardless of how friendly they are, should have his claws kept 
trimmed. Clip off the curved, sharp tip about once a month. Your veterinarian 
can show you how to do this. A mild swat from an untrimmed claw can give your 
bunny an undetected scratch that may later blossom into an abscess.
<p>When Daphne is in her cage, the two have a chance to get used to each 
other's smell, sounds, movements, etc. A cage that's large enough for the 
rabbit to do some dashing is ideal, as Felix will be able to observe rabbit 
aerobics and become accustomed to it.</p>
<p>  This phase may take days, weeks, or even months, depending on the 
animals' personalities. Don't rush things. It's much better to go too slowly 
and succeed than to push it and stress Daphne or have to scold Felix. Scolding 
is the least effective method of feline education. It usually teaches the cat 
(a) wait till the humans are away and then torment the rabbit to your heart's 
content or (b) rabbit=scolding, which is not a good way to begin a friendship.
</p>
<p>When you feel ready to move on, the next step is to give Daphne and Felix 
supervised access to each other. That means, hang out with them in a room where 
you can intervene if necessary, but don't intervene unless absolutely 
necessary. Give them a chance to work things out in their own way. If Felix is 
mostly respectful and curious, let him sniff and investigate. If he's 
rambunctious, squirt him with water a few times. Try not to let him know that 
it's you doing the squirting, or he will associate it with you instead of with 
the behavior. The water should come as an unpleasant surprise, or, more 
technically, an environmental reprimand. If you find you're resorting to the 
water-pistol frequently, that means you've moved ahead too soon. Go back to the 
cage phase. Eventually, most rabbits and cats get used to each other. It's just 
a matter of time and, in some cases, supervision.</p>
<p> </p>
<h4>BIG, BOSSY BUNNY</h4>This is by far the most common scenario. Cat and 
rabbit meet, indoors. Rabbit charges up to cat. Cat, non-plussed, backs off. 
The cat may even run from the rabbit. Most rabbits will chase only till they 
feel they've made their point. These two guys require no human intervention. 
Once Daphne feels she's asserted herself to her satisfaction, she and Felix can 
become roommates, friends, or soulmates.
<p> If you're introducing a new rabbit to a resident cat, you may need to give 
the rabbit time to establish a sense of territory in your home before she takes 
on Felix. It's generally a good idea to confine a new animal, whether cat or 
rabbit, to a small area at first, either a cage or a single room. Change is 
stressful for rabbits as it is for humans. Arrival in a new home is more than 
enough stress for a rabbit. Don't put her in the position of having to get used 
to new territory, new humans, and new cat all at once. Wait till she's 
confident and comfortable.</p>
<p></p>
<h4>USE YOUR SIXTH SENSE</h4>  At our foster home we rescue both cats and 
rabbits. Over the years we have had the opportunity to observe many cat/rabbit 
introductions. By far the most important element you can contribute to this 
process is your intuition. Get to know your own cat and rabbit. Listen to what 
they tell you about their level of stress, when they're ready for changes, 
whether they're lonely, and so on. Let them set the timetable. This is the 
information that will allow you to shape the general guidelines given here to 
suit your situation.
<p>Creating a place where cats and rabbits can live together peaceably is a 
satisfying endeavor. It makes you think, if this predator can snuggle with this 
prey animal, maybe there's hope for a compassionate world, after all. It's a 
start, anyway.</p>
