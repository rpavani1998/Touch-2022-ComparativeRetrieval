<p>Probably why I prefer cats to dogs. Not that I don&rsquo;t like dogs, just 
somebody elses dog.</p> </li>

<p>This is obviously wrong. Cats are monarchists. </p> </li>

<p>How dare you! Dogs are conservatives - they believe in family, charity, 
trust, hard work. Many Republican voters, and even a Republican politician once 
in while, are true conservatives.</p> 
<p>Democrats, on the other hand, are snakes, locusts. I&rsquo;m trying to 
think of an animal that will eat its own young - do any snakes or fish do that?

<p>Dustydog - I know that fish will eat their young its just food to them. 
Alpha male Jack Russel Terriers will kill just born puppies as they tend to 
view them as rats or other such things that they hunt and kill, not to eat just 
to kill. Once they get to be a few weeks old they are safe from the Alpha male.

<p>Other way around, in my experience&hellip;</p> 
<p>I&rsquo;d make the case that Cats are Democrats&hellip;expecting everything 
to be provided for them, including someone to clean up the litter pan after 
them&hellip;they don&rsquo;t feel obligated to earn their keep by alerting to 
intruders or defending the home, they expect to be pampered and attended to by 
the hardworking homeowner. they&rsquo;re more interested in welfare and drugs 
(Cat Chow and Catnip) than in work (catching mice).</p> </li> </ol>
