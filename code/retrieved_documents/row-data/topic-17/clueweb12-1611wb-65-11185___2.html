about the Bible</p>  Dogs and Cats <br>

<p>In the March copy of &ldquo;The Net&rdquo;, we had an account of &ldquo;A 
Day in the Life of a Parish Dog&rdquo;, and it was this that started me 
thinking of how much we owe to the animals that share our lives, and whether we 
appreciate them as gifts from God.</p> 
<p>I know that there are people who do not like dogs, and some say they prefer 
cats. For myself, I enjoy both, and I do not believe you can make comparisons 
between them. But I suppose people speak out of their own experience.</p> 
<p> I feel sure that anyone who has known a dog with a good temperament, which 
has been properly brought up, will have come to appreciate just what 
companionship and affection that dog can offer us, in our own lives.</p> 
<p>It was my father's dog that I first knew; he was an Irish Setter called 
Rambler, and he was a fantastic dog. I think it was through him that I learned 
to love dogs, and it was with great joy that I first got my own spaniel, for my 
eleventh birthday. We always had a cat as well; they were always called Dinah, 
and I was quite fond of them too, but it was nothing personal, like it was with 
Rambler.</p> 
<p>Dogs get a somewhat negative mention in the Bible. They were used as guard 
dogs, and, of course to help with the flocks, but they were basically regarded 
as unclean, and there is certainly no Biblical record of dogs as pets. And as 
for cats, we come across lions and leopards in the Bible, but no word about 
cats, even though I believe they were actually worshipped in Egypt. Perhaps the 
whole idea of keeping pets began later, in Anglo-Saxon times, when the long 
dark winter nights kept people at home by the fire.</p> 
<p>There is quite a lot we can learn from our dogs. You could say that we are 
to dogs, as God is to us, and they give us a picture of faithfulness, and 
obedience, which we might well see as an example of how we ourselves ought to 
be, in our relationship with God. Of course they do sometimes misbehave &ndash; 
or should it be called 'trespassing'?- but they are sorry and ask forgiveness, 
with no attempt at justification, and certainly no questioning, or resentment. 
It was an elderly priest I once knew, who spelt all this out to me, and I also 
remember how he added that it was easier for dogs than it is for us, because 
whereas a dog lives in the presence of his God, and can demonstrate his love 
and his dependence directly, we cannot see our God, and can only make contact 
with him through prayer.</p> 
<p>But what about cats? They are often very affectionate, and give us 
companionship as well, but whereas a dog is believer in us, I think a cat 
&ndash; not an atheist, for sure, but perhaps bit of an agnostic. After all, 
they have to be quite self-absorbed, with all that responsibility to keep 
themselves clean, and safe ,too, wherever possible. But they are still a 
delight, and to be fully accepted and trusted by a cat is really a lasting joy.
</p> 
<p>So let's never forget to thank God for his wisdom, in giving us animals to 
live with us, to be our trusted and trusting friends, with the capacity, also, 
to have some way of communicating with us, and sharing much of our lives.</p>
