 Published: 03/19/2012 03:39 PM EDT on Lifes 
Little Mysteries</p> 
<p> Many pet owners leave their home radios playing all day for the listening 
pleasure of their dogs and cats. Station choices vary. &quot;We have a very 
human tendency to project onto our pets and assume that they will like what we 
like,&quot; said Charles Snowdon, an authority on the musical preferences of 
animals. &quot;People assume that if they like Mozart, their dog will like 
Mozart. If they like rock music, they say their dog prefers rock.&quot;</p> 
<p> Against the conventional wisdom that music is a uniquely human phenomenon, 
ongoing research shows that animals actually do have the capacity for 
music.&nbsp;But rather than liking classical or rock, Snowdon, an animal 
psychologist at the&nbsp;University&nbsp;of Wisconsin-Madison, has discovered 
that animals&nbsp;march to the beat of a different drum altogether. They enjoy 
what he calls &quot;species-specific music&quot;: tunes specially designed 
using the pitches, tones and tempos that are familiar to their particular 
species.</p> 
<p> With no pun intended, music is all about scale: Humans like music that 
falls within our acoustic and vocal range, uses tones we understand, and 
progresses at a tempo similar to that of our heartbeats. A tunepitched too high 
or low sounds grating or ungraspable, and music too fast or slow is 
unrecognizable as such.</p> 
<p> To animals, human music falls into that grating, unrecognizable category. 
With vocal ranges and heart rates very different from ours, they simply aren't 
wired to enjoy songs that are tailored for our ears. Studies show that animals 
generally respond to human music with a total lack of interest. With this 
general rule in mind, Snowdon has worked with cellist and composer David Teie 
to compose music that is tailored to suit<em>them</em>.</p> 
<p> Back in 2009, the researchers composed two songs for tamarins 
&mdash;&nbsp;monkeys with vocalizations three octaves higher than our own and 
heart rates twice as fast. The songs sound shrill and unpleasant to us, but 
they seem to be music to the monkeys' ears. The song modeled on excited monkey 
tones and a fast tempo made the tamarins visibly agitated and active. By 
contrast, they calmed down and became unusually social in response to a 
&quot;tamarin ballad,&quot; which incorporatedhappy monkey tones and a slower 
tempo.</p> 
<p> Snowdon and Teie have moved on to composing music for cats, and studying 
how they respond to it.</p> <br>

<p> &quot;We have some work-in-progress where we've transposed music and put 
it in the frequency range for cat vocalizations, and have used their resting 
heart rate, which is faster than ours,&quot; he told Life's Little Mysteries. 
&quot;We find that cats prefer to listen to the music composed in their 
frequency range and tempo rather than human music.&quot;</p> 
<p> On the basis of their results, Teie has started selling cat songs online 
(at $1.99 per song) through a company called &quot;Music for Cats.&quot;</p> 
<p> Dogs are tougher nuts to crack, mostly because breeds vary widely in size, 
vocal range and heart rate. However, large dogs such as Labradors or mastiffs 
have&nbsp;vocal ranges&nbsp;that are quite similar to those of adult male 
humans. &quot;So, it is possible that they might be responsive to music in our 
frequency range. My prediction is that a big&nbsp;dog&nbsp;might be more 
responsive to human music than a smaller dog such as a Chihuahua,&quot; Snowdon 
said. [Dogs Play the Piano in New Video]</p> 
<p> Indeed, some dogs do appear to respond emotionally to human music. 
Research led by Deborah Wells, a psychologist at Queen's University Belfast, 
shows that dogs can discern between human music of different genres. &quot;Our 
own research has shown that dogs certainly behave differently in response to 
different types of music, e.g., showing behaviors more suggestive of relaxation 
in response to classical music and behaviors more suggestive of agitation in 
response to heavy metal music,&quot; Wells wrote in an email.</p> 
<p> Considering the great demand for new ways to please our pets, more 
progress is likely to be made in the field of animal music. But no matter how 
well composers perfect their dog, cat and monkey songs, the animals will 
probably never appreciate their species-specific music quite as much ashumans 
appreciate ours. According to Snowdon, they lack an important musical ability 
that we possess: relative pitch.</p> 
<p> &quot;We can recognize that a sequence of notes is the same whether it's 
in the key of F or A flat,&quot; he said. &quot;I have found that animals have 
very good absolute pitch, but they don't have relative pitch. They can learn to 
recognize a sequence of notes, but if you transpose the notes to a different 
key, so that the sequence uses the same relative notes but the key is 
different, they can't recognize the relationships between the notes 
anymore.&quot;</p> 
<p> He added, &quot;To that extent, we understand music in a different way 
than animals do.&quot;</p>

6 hours ago ( 2:53 PM) I've had pet owners leave music on for their pets, or a 
TV. I've done it for my own when I'm out of town for a long period on vacation. 
I've done it for client's pets who seem a bit anxious too.

never took their personal preference into consideration! LOL Silence might be

 7 hours 
ago ( 2:09 PM) Off track here, but my year-old Chihuahua &quot;Molly 
Tamale&quot; LOVES television. She'll watch it for hours. It almost matters not 
what the subject; she'll even likes the news. We had a video flick on about a 
porpoise and a dog..... she sat steadfast, eyes never leaving the screen for an 
hour and a half, except for an occasional romp up and down at the base of the 
screen; growling, barking. I know some dogs enjoy TV, but this girl's attention 
span is incredible.  Loulou72: Off track here, but my year-old Chihuahua

04:31 AM on 03/23/2012 I had a cat that strongly objected to rock music, 
specifically the Rolling Stones and New Wave. Any time he didn't like a song, 
he'd bat the tone arm of the turn table to the stile. He seemed to like opera 
just fine.<br>
<br>
 None of my cats like jazz, which seems a bit 
counterintuitive but they all like classical music.  Trompe_loeil: I had a cat

<br>  10:34 PM on 03/22/2012  My cat does the same, except it's not female 
singers.<br>
 My cat absolutely loves the piano, My Fiance plays the piano very 
well, and he'll practice daily. Can you guess who's right besides him ALL the 
time? Mr. Parolis Jenkins(My Tabby).<br>

 He also likes any Two steps from 
Hell song I play, which is weird. I game on the PC, so I listen to a lot of 
their music while I game and he'll sit there right by the speakers as well.
