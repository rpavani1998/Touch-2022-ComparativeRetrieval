<h2> Cats and/or Dogs and why? </h2> 
<blockquote> A big thanks to Twilight for the idea for poll question this week.
 I like both cats and dogs but right now only have cats because our backyard is 
mostly pool and concrete and I am not home enough to properly care for a dog. 
That said, we had a party for my daughter this weekend and with loads of people 
at our house our 12 year old cat was not happy. He got scared and felt 
threatened and was hissing at one of the guests. I grabbed him to prevent him 
from biting a guest and he ended up biting me. It hurt like a bizzoutch, but 
that was only the beginning. My hand is now swollen up the size of a grapefruit 
and the infection is apparently spreading. Typing or moving my hand hurts like 
hell. If it doesn't start getting better within the next couple of days I will 
have to go in for IV antibiotics. Yeah, fun stuff.<br>
<br>
 But I can't blame 
him. He was scared and didn't know what was going on. Getting old apparently 
sucks, even for animals. We will have to lock him up from now on when we have 
parties. Hopefully this swelling goes down soon. This sucks!!<br>
<br>
 What 
about you all? Cats or dogs or both and why? If you prefer other animals or 
none at all, please vote other and explain why. </blockquote>

<blockquote> We have three cats and two dogs... I love my cats and prefer them 
a touch over the dogs most because our dogs are nothing more then lap warmers. 
<br> <br>
 and before Peench asks and I know he well.... Don't let your 
daughter foster animals as then they never go back. To be fair the first foster 
cat did go back and ended up at a great home.... The second however decided to 
stay he is a cute kitten. Best of all the house is now tipped to the male side.

<blockquote> our house, we have two cats and a Cockatiel bird. They're all 
pets mom somehow picked up. She found the bird, and got suckered by the vet 
with the cats.<br>
<br>
 I like cats myself because of their independence. They 
can and will entertain themselves. But they also come over when they want 
attention. Of course, I give them attention when they don't want it either.<br>

<br> I don't know what you did Peench, but apparently you were way to 
aggressive with your cat, and probably why you got bit so hard. Next time your 
kitty gets spooked, make sure to talk to him/her in calm voice and already have 
your hand out, but out of reach, so you kitty knows you're trying to help. If 
your cat is ever superfreaked, I've ran into this here and there, get a 
blanket, and throw it over the cat, then pick him/her up. One, it's protects 
you from extremely aggressive cat behavior, and two, they calm down when they 
don't see anything. And I can annoy the hell out of my cats where they will 
whine and hiss at me, take swings, try to bite and so on. But they still know 
I'm the alpha male, so they're usually not quite as aggressive to me as towards 
others. I also do the same crap to my friends' pets and always come out fine, 
8). And yes, I have been scratched and bit before from cats, but usually just 
surface wounds. The bad stuff is usually from holding the cat and the cat got 
superspooked all of sudden. You just have to treat them like a toddler when 
they're scared, and you should do ok. </blockquote>

<blockquote> Right now, we have none. Prior to kids, we had 2 Miniature 
Pinschers. They were both rescue dogs, and we loved them. Unfortunately, one of 
them didn't care too much for our kids, so we gave them back to the rescue 
organization, which quickly had them adopted out again. (They didn't want them 
in a situation where they were biting.) Other than that, they were really good 
dogs and I would get that breed again, in a heartbeat.<br>
<br>
 My wife now 
wants to have a cat or two. I am not a big fan of cats because they like to 
climb up as high as they can get, their hair gets everywhere, and the litter 
box really stinks, regardless of when it was last changed. In spite of that, I 
told my wife that I would allow a cat in our house, but I will NOT be the one 
to change the litter box; our daughters must do it. Right now, they are not old 
enough for this task, so it'll be a few years before cat(s). My wife tried to 
tell me, &quot;I'll change it. I promise!&quot; I didn't fall for that.

<blockquote> I would prefer neither, because I don't need the extra BS on top 
of dealing with kids, but we have 2 cats. Which are not my responsibility of 
course. My wife NEVER has good luck with pets. They always seem to need a TON 
of medical care ($$$$$) and that drives me nuts. Hence why I lean more and more 
to having no pets these days. Except for my reef tank of course. My corals 
won't crap on my floors.<br>
<br>
 I would take cats over a dog simply because 
cats will use a litter box (wife scoops the crap everyday - no stinky), WAY 
easier to deal with when going on a vacation, they don't smell and don't tend 
to ruin a yard.<br>
 The manly man in me though would love to have a badass 
Doberman that would kill any intruder once one foot hits the floor. My wife 
always asks if we can get a tiny ass dog. Pff...if I have to deal with a dog, 
it's gonna be one that can totally maul somebody if need be. One that is 
deserving of the name<i>Crippler</i> or <i>Vadar.</i> </blockquote>

<blockquote> I voted cats because they are pretty much self sufficient and 
very low key for the most part. We have 2 cats that we each had before we met 
and even though we have lived together for over 3 years now, the cats are still 
&quot;mine and hers&quot;.<br>
<br>
 Her cat is a crotchety old male that 
hisses at me whenever I pick him up or move him from my side of the bed, and 
Mine is a timid female that was stray and runs from everyone but me.<br>
<br>
 
She really wants to get a dog also, but they are such a pain in the ass to take 
care of. I love dogs and part of me wants one also, but having a dog seems a 
lot like having a kid. </blockquote>

<blockquote> Zoom, if you don't want a cat that climbs on everything, look for 
one that tends to be &quot;four on the floor.&quot; Of course, I tend to find 
you can greatly reduce the climbing thing if you stay on top of them about it 
right from the get go. Not to say mine don't climb on stuff, but they do it 
behind my back.<br>
<br>
 I find cats can be trained. It just takes a bit more 
patience, and you cannot let up and have to be extremely consistent till they 
get it. Heck, our previous cats, I had almost walking on their two back legs 
after about six months; I made them sit up, beg, for food. Mom took over 
feeding duties and she let them be lazy and just sit on their butts.

<blockquote> Have 2 dogs, a beagle (Emmitt) and a pointer mix (Boo). They're 
great. Reasonably obedient. Hilarious to watch. Boo's developed into a great 
trail dog.<br>
<br>
 I've never been into cats, but we have a cat (Cleo) now 
that lives outside except on winter nights when she's in the basement. She's 
fine, I have no issues with her, but she's not very interactive. Any attempt to 
get her to change behaviors in ANY way is met with a total freakfest. Mainly 
she's just<i>there</i>. Occasionally I see her if I'm sitting on the deck 
having a beer. She walks up, says &quot;meow&quot;, I scratch her on the back, 
she disappears.<br>
<br>
 I didn't say it was a deep relationship. </blockquote>

<blockquote> my previous cat, Freakles, she would be waiting at the front step 
for me to come home. She was very possessive of me. We see her go knock the 
crap out of other cats that would be within a 100 yards of me. Since I was 
young when I first got her, she would even play with my toys I left out during 
the day. Of course, I had her ever since she was born. I could snap or wave my 
fingers and she would come for pets. Heck, I could do a dinner call, and her 
and all her siblings would come running, as long as they could here me; luckily 
I know how to be loud. It was funny watching six cats come running for food 
from two blocks away, LOL. </blockquote>

<blockquote> Although im a bit allergic i like cats more. They are fun, 
independent, and know when you need some comforting. A dog is always there and 
happy to see you/be around you. It maybe just coincidence, but sometimes when 
you feel sad, your cat will just pop up and hop on your lap and look at 
you...it just may want you to scratch an itch, but hell you dont know that.<br>

<br> Dont get me wrong i love dogs, but i lean more too cats. Since im not 1 
bit allergic to dogs though, ill get one when i have a big enough home for my 
beloved &quot;Argentina Dogo&quot;. Dogs that always jump on you annoy me, so 
dogs need to be trained real well. The owner might like it, but others dont.<br>
