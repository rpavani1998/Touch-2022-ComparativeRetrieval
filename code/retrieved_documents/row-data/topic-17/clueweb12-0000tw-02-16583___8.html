<p>When many people decide to add a four-legged best friend to their family, 
often the local pet shop is the first place they look. It is unfortunate that 
more people do not consider looking at their localanimal shelter first. There 
are many wonderful dogs without homes just looking for the right family.</p> 
<p>There are a lot of myths about rescue dogs and that is why more people do 
not seek them out. Below, some of these myths are dispelled.</p> <br>

<p>Myth #1: All rescue dogs are mutts.</p> 
<p>The large majority of dogs that you will find at the pound are probably not 
purebred. There are, however, specific dog breed rescues around the country if 
you are looking for a particular breed. By the same token, mutts can make just 
as good if not better pets as purebreds.</p> 
<p>Myth #2: There is something wrong with a rescue dog. There is a reason that 
the dog ended up at the pound.</p> 
<p>The answer here is a qualified yes. Obviously, there is a reason that dogs 
end up at theanimal shelter, but it does not always have to do with the dog. 
Sometimes owners pass on before their dogs. Sometimes dogs have dysfunctional 
owners. Sometimes dogs just aren't the right match for a particular family but 
might be the right fit for you.</p> 
<p>Myth #3: Rescue dogs are set in their ways.</p> 
<p>It is true that if you adopt a dog, you are most likely not going to get a 
puppy. However, there are as many positives about this as there are negatives. 
If you are lucky, you will receive a dog that is already housetrained, can walk 
on a leash, and knows some simple commands. At the very least, you know what 
you are getting with an older dog.</p> 
<p>Myth #4: Rescue dogs can't be trusted with children.</p> 
<p>It is true that many rescue dogs end up at the pound because they couldn't 
be trusted around small children. It is also true, however, that there are many 
rescue dogs who are wonderful around children. The same is true of any dog. As 
long as dogs are properly matched up with owners, all will be well.</p> 
<p>These are just some of the many reasons why rescue dogs deserve a chance at 
adoption. Still not sure if a rescue dog is right for you? Consider that the 
cost of adopting a rescue dog is often much less than buying from a reputable 
breeder, and the money goes toward other needy dogs. In addition, the shelter 
will often pay for your first vet visit, spay or neuter, and first shots. All 
in all, rescue dogs are a great option for many families.</p>
