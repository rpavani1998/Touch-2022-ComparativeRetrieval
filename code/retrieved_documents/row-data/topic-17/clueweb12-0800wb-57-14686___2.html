 Hello Brother Joey, 
<br> <br>
Posting a picture of your dog is just fine. I have some pictures of 
my dog and some who have passed away, but I don't have them on a hot link so I 
can post them. I've had dogs all of my life, and all of them have been good 
dogs. Many of our dogs have lived to over 15, and that's pretty old for a dog. 
We treat them really good, and I think that's one of the main reasons why they 
live so long. We did lose one beautiful Australian Shepherd at 5 with 
congestive heart failure.<br>
<br>
By the way, your dog is beautiful. YES, it's 
a medical fact that pets are good for us, and I've always thought that was 
particularly true for dogs. I think it has quite a bit to do with unconditional 
love. My little dog I have now has a white face, and he's a big baby. He cries 
every time we go anywhere even for a few minutes. We get home and he acts like 
we've been gone for days. He even makes a noise like singing from time to time 
when I pet him, and I do spoil him rotten.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I don't get 
out much because of disability, and he's been a great little companion for me 
when my wife is gone. NO - I'm not comparing him to my wife.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br>

 I like dogs 
best. Most of my life I have had pets, birds and turtles, and a few cats, but 
dogs are better companions. I love walking in the woods and enjoy the company 
of a big dog. Safety is often an issue anymore and usually people don't miss 
with you if you have a big dog at your side. But I enjoy the fact that if 
trained well, they listen well and are fun to be around. Sometimes they appear 
to listen and grief with us, know what we need, or enjoy the view. My dogs and 
I explored the woods in winter and summer. Trained not to harm animals we both 
gazed with wonder at deer and baby fawns, groundhogs, and turkeys and even fish 
in the streams.<br>
The few cats I had were outside cats we had on the farm. 
Watched them grow up, laughed at the silly things they did as kittens, and 
spent winter evenings helping my favorite cat raid the hen house in search of 
mice. But cats do what they want when they feel like it all the time. Dogs 
enjoy being with people and listen and respond better than cats. <br>

 Hello islandboy. <br>
<br>
For the 
most part that is very true. Every once in a while though I've found a cat that 
behaves more like a dog. I've had two that would respond to only their name. 
None of that kitty-kitty stuff for them. They would greet me at the door just 
like a dog would. When I worked on my truck they would be there watching me. If 
I worked in the garden one of them would climb on my shoulder and watch. The 
other would even try to help me pull weeds yet even left the plants I wanted 
alone.<br>
<br>
We currently have two dogs and a cat. The one dog we have had 
for a little over 6 yrs now. He turns the touch lamp off at night for me and if 
I drop something on the floor will get it for me. We adopted the other dog when 
my brother passed on. She is 3 yrs old. It took us awhile to get her over the 
grieving process of missing my brother but she has become a really great 
companion, too. The cat was just recently dropped off on us. She is just a baby 
but already very well behaved in just a few weeks. She has been adopted by our 
female dog which has never had babies of her own. That seemed to help her a lot 
to get over my brother's absence.<br>

 We were without dogs for awhile after our last 
elderly dog had to be put to sleep from cancer. He was 18 and we lost his buddy 
that same year at 17.<br>
<br>
We did some research about breeds and thought it 
would be some time before we would get another dog. But, things worked together 
just right, and we found both breeds we were interested in at the same place - 
same day. We wanted healthy, non-shedding, non-allergenic, loving, companion 
type dogs that live a long time and are great with small children. &quot;Guard 
and Protection&quot; weren't on the list of concerns. So, our first two choices 
were Bichon Frise and Shih Tzu. I think that I spelled those breeds right. Both 
of them are small lap-type dogs. The Bichon looks like a white toy poodle, and 
the Shih Tzu looks like a small Ewok on Star Wars.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br>
<br>
<br>

<br>The above is a fairly recent picture of Hank the Ewok and Lucy the Bichon. 
They filled a void, and we love them. Hank is now 5 months old and Lucy is 4 
months old. They've been considerable work as puppies - but worth every minute. 
They've also been a ton of fun. They follow us around and want to be with us 
doing everything. I would say that the breed information was correct that they 
are wonderful companion dogs. They give us a lot more than we give them. <br>

Hello Brother Joey, <br>
<br>
It's nice to hear from you. These little guys have already brought us a lot of 
joy. Their job is to cuddle, play, and be petted - and they are doing their 
jobs.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br>
<br>
My last little dog who died sat almost touching me 
hours every day while I worked on the computer. Those who have lost a little 
dog who was an old friend will understand. We lost two old friends who were 
faithful little companions for almost 1/3 of our lives. Some who don't 
understand would say that my wife and I were silly, but I'll just say that we 
loved them. <br>

Those puppies in the picture are so cute.<br>
I too know the loss of a good dog 
that spent 10 years by my side. I found him as a abandoned puppy along side the 
road. He was so ill the vet told me he was not expected to live. However, the 
vet never told him. I fed him mighty dog food and gave him&nbsp; lots of love, 
and so he managed to grow into a big dog, although the vet said he would be 
beagle sized. So it was a real blessing to me when he managed to live for ten 
years. He passed away in his sleep. It was one of the hardest times in my life 
dealing with the grief of losing him. <br>

 Hello Islandboy, <br>
<br>
They say that dogs 
are good for your health, and I believe it. It is pretty heart-breaking when 
they pass away, but you at least know they had a good home and someone who 
loved them. Our puppies are already well-established members of the family. I'm 
positive that they already love us and we love them. The longest my wife and I 
have been without a dog in over 50 years is about 2 months. The loss of our 
last little dog after 18 years was really hard, but we have many special 
memories. You sound like a person who understands making a dog part of the 
family. We treat our dogs extremely well. We didn't think we would be able to 
handle another one for awhile, but it turns out that it was good for us to get 
a couple of puppies. It was good for them also since they got out of those 
cages and had two humans to train.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br>
