<p>Content advisory: Cartoon violence; fleeting profanity.</p> 
<h4>By Steven D. Greydanus</h4> 
<p>&quot;Dogs,&quot; Winston Churchill once observed, &quot;look up to us, 
cats look down at us, but pigs treat us as equals.&quot; There are no pigs in<i>
Cats and Dogs</i> &mdash; though, if there were, I doubt they would be inclined 
to regard the film&rsquo;s insipid human characters as their peers. But the 
rest of Churchill&rsquo;s observation applies.</p> 
<p>In the whimsical world of <i>Cats and Dogs</i>, cats are megalomanical 
plotters bent on taking over the world, while dogs are counter-insurgency 
operatives devoted to protecting mankind. For some cat lovers, this may seem 
offensively pro-dog propaganda; but the movie, like Churchill, has a point. 
Dogs are social creatures, pack animals who naturally band together with their 
fellows (canine or human) against an outside threat. Cats are naturally 
solitary creatures, each of whom tends to want to be the king of his own 
particular hill.</p> 
<p>Not that I&rsquo;ve anything against cats. But there&rsquo;s a particular 
breed of cat fancier who looks down at dogs precisely for qualities like their 
obedience, loyalty, and desire to please, explicitly preferring the fierce 
independence and proud impassiveness associated with cats. I wonder whether 
this kind of cat appreciation isn&rsquo;t often rooted in a misguided human 
ideal &mdash; whether such people don&rsquo;t prefer cats because they 
themselves like the idea of being remote and independent.</p> 
<p>Yet God has made us social creatures, called to community with one another 
and ultimately to the community that is the Blessed Trinity. For all that we 
may appreciate cats for being what God has made them, the fact is that we 
ourselves are happier and better if we are, to put it bluntly, more like dogs. 
And, in a story of anthropomorphic dogs and cats, especially if they&rsquo;re 
battling one another, it&rsquo;s more natural to identify with the dogs.</p> 
<p>In <i>Cats and Dogs</i>, this battle plays out in cartoony <i>007</i> or <i>
Spy-vs.-Spy</i>  scenarios covertly carried on out of sight from unsuspecting 
humans. The notion of a hidden world of colorful high-powered espionage lurking 
beneath prosaically domestic appearances was of course also the premise of this 
year&rsquo;s highly enjoyable and successful<i>Spy Kids</i>.</p> 
<p>That film brought great goofy gusto and visual verve to its picture of a 
world in which parents may turn out to be much cooler than their kids think.<i>
Cats and Dogs</i> may be playing the same game as <i>Spy Kids</i>, but it 
isn&rsquo;t in the same league. For one thing, it lacks the inspired set and 
prop design that elevated the earlier film to luminous eye candy. More 
importantly, it lacks<i>Spy Kids</i>&rsquo;s engaging characterizations and 
winningly positive view of parenthood and family life.</p> 
<p>What it does have is a comparable level of rollicking energy, along with 
some real laughs along the way. That&rsquo;s enough to qualify<i>Cats and Dogs
</i> as a pretty decent family flick in its own right. The zany slapstick 
violence is in the classic old Warner-Brothers cartoon tradition, and much of 
the humor stems from familiar animal traits. (In one scene, a canine agent 
races through an underground tunnel in a rocket car &mdash; with his head stuck 
out the window.)</p> 
<p>It&rsquo;s also pretty cool to look at. By now, of course, we&rsquo;ve all 
seen animals talking through the magic of digital post-production and high-end 
puppeteering, in movies from the classic<i>Babe</i> to the less-than-classic 
Eddie Murphy<i>Doctor Dolittle</i> flicks. In <i>Cats and Dogs</i>, animals not 
only talk, they do kung fu. Never mind if it looks fakey &mdash; it&rsquo;s 
about as realistic as many live-action kung-fu movies, not to mention the 
Coyote-Road-Runner cartoons that are another inspiration. (Looking at these 
kung-fu fighting housepets, I was reminded of Samuel Johnson&rsquo;s famous 
remark about dogs walking on their hind legs: &quot;It is not done well, but 
you are surprised to find it done at all.&quot;)</p> 
<p>Anyway, as <i>Shrek</i> demonstrated, just because a thing doesn&rsquo;t 
look<i>realistic</i> doesn&rsquo;t mean it doesn&rsquo;t look <i>cool</i>. 
Consider the remarkable effect of the obviously animatronic expressions on the 
face of an otherwise live-action cat. Don&rsquo;t bother trying to figure out 
where the puppet ends and the cat begins; the computer wizards have hidden 
their tracks well.</p> 
<p>Unlike <i>Shrek</i> and <i>Doctor Dolittle 2</i>, both of which relied on 
low humor and off-color jokes,<i>Cats and Dogs</i> is good, clean fun, only 
occasionally slipping in material that might seem crass in another film but 
somehow works here. (When a veteran dog agent discovers that the trained 
recruit he was promised has been replaced by an inexperienced puppy, he groans, 
&quot;He&rsquo;s still got his you-know-whats for crying out loud!&quot;)</p> 
<p>The plot (and there is one) involves a feline conspiracy to subvert the 
research of an eccentric scientist (Jeff Goldblum) who wants to develop a 
formula to cure humans who are allergic to dogs. That would give dogs an edge 
in the housepet wars; but an evil white Persian named Mr. Tinkles (voiced by 
Sean Hayes) has a clever scheme that would give cats the ascendancy by instead 
making everybody allergic to all dogs. (This whole business of a 
&quot;formula&quot; to cure allergies is kind of quaint; I just heard on the 
radio about scientific attempts to<i>bioengineer</i> a hypoallergenic cat. I 
wonder how Mr. Tinkles would feel about that?)</p> 
<p>This storyline manages to be reasonably clever and entertaining for awhile, 
though it runs out of steam before the end. At ninety minutes, the movie feels 
long &mdash; particularly whenever the story focuses on the lame human 
characters.</p> 
<p>It&rsquo;s here, especially, that <i>Cats and Dogs</i> suffers from 
inevitable comparisons to<i>Spy Kids</i>. Jeff Goldblum&rsquo;s <i>uber</i>
-dorky scientist dad and Elizabeth Perkins&rsquo;s pressured Realtor mom 
don&rsquo;t hold a candle to Antonio Banderas and Carla Gugino. (It 
doesn&rsquo;t help that Goldblum sleepwalks through the role.) And give me the 
refreshingly natural sibling interaction of<i>Spy Kids</i>&rsquo;s Juni and 
Carmen any day over young Scott Brody (Alexander Pollock), who&rsquo;s got such 
a preternatural case of the sulks that when his mom brings home an adorable 
puppy he names it &quot;Lou&quot; &mdash; short for &quot;Loser.&quot; (Go 
peddle your papers, movie child.)</p> 
<p>Yet Hollywood family fare has been so dismal for so long that, despite its 
shortcomings,<i>Cats and Dogs</i> still comes as a breath of fresh air. 
Together with<i>Spy Kids</i> (and, for older children perhaps, <i>Shrek</i>), 
<i>Cats and Dogs</i> begins to wipe out the bad memory of real losers like <i>
How the Grinch Stole Christmas</i> and <i>102 Dalmatians</i>. In fact, <i>Cats 
and Dogs</i> is the best family film parents can look forward to until August 
&mdash; when Dimension Films is scheduled to rerelease a revamped special 
edition of<i>Spy Kids</i>!</p>
