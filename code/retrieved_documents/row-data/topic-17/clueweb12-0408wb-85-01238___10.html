<h2>Do you have any puppies?</h2> 
<p>No &#150; we do not home very young puppies.&nbsp; A dog has to be a 
certain age before a decision is made about its potential to be a working Guide 
Dog, the typical age for withdrawn dogs is usually between 6-18 months 
old.&nbsp; We would encourage all people considering rehoming a puppy to look 
at our rehoming scheme and consider a withdrawn or retired dog.&nbsp; If you 
are still considering a puppy then you may wish to read about ourPuppy Walking 
Scheme.</p> 
<h2>What breeds of dogs do you rehome, and what are the characteristics of 
each one?</h2> 
<p>We typically breed Labrador cross Golden Retrievers but do also have pure 
Labradors, Golden Retrievers, Flat Coat Retrievers and German Shepherd Dogs 
occasionally available.&nbsp; Characteristics do vary from breed to breed and 
dog to dog.&nbsp; Information about particular breeds can be found on the 
Kennel clubs website :www.kennelclub.org.uk</p> 
<h2>What kinds of dogs do you rehome?</h2> 
<p>Our dogs for rehoming fall into two categories:- </p> 
<p><strong>Retired:</strong> </p> 
<p>These dogs usually retire from work around 9 to 11 years of age. It is 
common for the Guide Dog to remain with their owner or their family or close 
friends who have been associated with the dog throughout it&#146;s life. 
Sometimes this is not possible so we look to find a suitable home where the dog 
can enjoy their hard-earned retirement. Retired guide dogs have spent most of 
their lives with constant human companionship and owing to this they can become 
distressed if left alone too frequently or for long periods of time.</p> 
<p><strong>Withdrawn:</strong> </p> 
<p>These are commonly dogs that have been withdrawn from our training scheme 
before they become a Guide Dog. Typically these dogs will be around 12-18 
months old. This can be for a number of reasons either health or behaviour 
related, these dogs which may not be suited to guiding may be perfect as a pet 
dog. Atypical behaviour reasons which make a dog unsuitable for a working life 
with Guide Dogs include many types of distractions, suspicions or anxiety 
around other animals or people. Health withdrawals can include skin, eye or 
joint conditions.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<h2>What support do you give to people rehoming a dog from Guide Dogs?</h2> 
<p>You will be given the dog&#146;s history and all relevant information for 
the dog.&nbsp; You will be allocated a specific Rehoming Officer who will be 
able to answer any questions at the time of your home visit and throughout the 
rehoming process.&nbsp; In addition to this you will get a call from your 
Rehoming Officer approximately two weeks after you Rehome a dog from us.&nbsp; 
If deemed necessary a follow up visit can be arranged.&nbsp; If at any time 
your situation changes the dog must be returned to Guide dogs where the 
Rehoming Officer will source another appropriate home.</p> 
<h2>How does the applicant list work?</h2> 
<p>Once you are added to the live applicant list and following your call from 
our Rehoming Officer we will look to see which dogs we have available for 
rehoming which best match your requirements.&nbsp; Some dogs and some people 
will have specific requirements and our aim to ensure that each dog is matched 
to the appropriate rehomer who can best suit and deal with the needs of the 
dog.&nbsp; This is not done on a first come first served basis.&nbsp; As a 
result of which waiting times can vary and could be several months to a 
year&#146;s wait.&nbsp; However, if you are open with your requirements then 
you are likely to be matched quicker than those with specific requirements 
&#150; i.e. you will take any breed, sex, medical or behavioural issue).</p> 
<h2>Where will I have to travel to in order to meet and collect my dog?</h2> 
<p>All of our dogs for rehoming will normally need to be introduced to your 
family at one of our four Dog Training Schools.&nbsp; The School where you 
application is processed is likely to be where we would ask you to attend for 
the introduction and collection of your dog.&nbsp; However, on occasion we may 
contact you and offer you a dog which is outside of your area in which case you 
will be asked to travel the distance to where the dog is located.&nbsp; You can 
find details of our Dog Training Schools here.&nbsp;<strong>Please note:&nbsp; 
A prior appointment must be made with your Rehoming Officer to view the 
dog.&nbsp; All rehoming is by appointment only.</strong></p> 
<h2>Where can I go to see your dogs for rehoming?</h2> 
<p>As we are not a rehoming/rescue charity we do not have specific centres. 
Entrance to the Dog Training Schools is by appointment only. You will be given 
full details and an appointment time to meet any prospective dog by your 
Rehoming Officer.</p> 
<h2>Why don&#146;t you have pictures of the dogs for rehoming?</h2> 
<p>As we are not a rehoming or rescue charity we do not advertise our dogs to 
be rehomed.&nbsp; The reason for withdrawal from training varies and we prefer 
to match our dogs and rehomers based on their needs rather than their 
looks!&nbsp; You can see images of rehomed Guide Dogs and typical working Guide 
Dogs across the website and can also read aboutcase studies<em>. </em></p> 
<h2>How much does it cost to rehome a dog from Guide Dogs?</h2> 
<p>For a member of the public to rehome a dog from us costs &pound;300.00 for 
a dog under 7yrs of age and &pound;100 for a dog over 7yrs of age.&nbsp; All of 
our dogs are neutered, microchipped, health checked and have regular 
preventative treatment again worms and fleas.</p> 
<h2>I work full time, can I still rehome a dog from Guide Dogs?</h2> 
<p>No &#150; due to the fact that our dogs have been used to constant human 
companionship this would be detrimental to their ongoing welfare.&nbsp; This 
includes people who work full time but come home for a lunch break.</p> 
<h2>Why are dogs withdrawn from the training program?</h2> 
<p>Some dogs are withdrawn from their training before they become a Guide 
Dog.&nbsp; Typically this will be at around 12-18 months old but it can be 
later.&nbsp; This can be for a variety of reasons either health or behaviour 
related.&nbsp; Just because a dog may not make the perfect Guide Dog it may 
still make the perfect pet!.&nbsp; Typical behaviour reasons which make the dog 
unsuitable for a working life with Guide Dogs include various forms of 
distraction, suspicion and or anxiety of other animals or people.&nbsp; Health 
withdrawals can include skin, eye and joint conditions.</p> 
<h2>Are your dogs microchipped and neutered before rehoming?</h2> 
<p>Yes &#150; all of our dogs are neutered, microchipped, heath checked and 
have regular preventative treatment against fleas and worms.</p> 
<h2>How old is a typical retired Guide Dog?</h2> 
<p>Retired dogs normally retire from work around 9 to 11 years of age.&nbsp; 
It is common for the Guide Dog to remain as a pet with their owner, family 
and/or close friends but sometimes this is not possible so we look at where the 
dogs can enjoy their hard-earned retirement. Retired dogs have spent the 
majority of their lives with human company and owing to this can become 
distressed if left alone too frequently or for long periods of time.</p> 
<h2>Can I rehome a dog from you if I already have another dog, cat or any 
other pets?</h2> 
<p>Yes, &nbsp;we are always open to rehoming a dog with other pets including 
cats if appropriate.&nbsp; However, not all of our dogs may be suitable and 
some may prefer to be the only pet, each case is dealt with on an individual 
needs basis and this will always be discussed with the Rehomer.</p> 
<h2>How much will it cost me in medical bills if I take on a dog with medical 
issues?</h2> 
<p>Ideally we would ask Rehomers to take on all costs for the dog.&nbsp; 
However, if the dog has an ongoing or serious condition any ongoing financial 
support can be discussed with your Rehoming Officer.</p> 
<h2>Why do you rehome retired Guide Dogs, isn&#146;t it better they stay with 
their Guide Dog Owner?</h2> 
<p>Guide Dog Owners and their family and close friends can be nominated to 
rehome a dog.&nbsp; This happens prior to the dogs being made available to the 
general public.&nbsp; When rehoming a retired Guide Dog we do ask the Rehomer 
to make contact with the Guide Dog Owner as these dogs have been their 
companion and means of independence for usually between 7 and 8 years of their 
lives.</p> 
<h2>Couldn&#146;t other organisations take your unwanted dogs instead of 
rehoming them to the public?</h2> 
<p>Guide Dogs regularly transfer withdrawn dogs to other Assistance Dog 
charities. All dogs are screened for their potential use in these charities 
before being offered to the public for rehoming.&nbsp;</p> <br>
