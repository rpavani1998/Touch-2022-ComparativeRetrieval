<strong>Pre-listening:</strong> Before 
reading the story to the class, ask the learners (working in small groups) to 
make a list everything cats and dogs have in common, and then to make a list of 
their differences. The lists produced by the different groups can then be 
compared and commented on.</p>

got angry with the cat.</p> 
<p><strong>Post-listening: </strong>Hand out the worksheets and work through 
the activities. The answers to the exercises are presented below.<br>

 Once long ago, Dog was 
married to Cat. They were happy together, but every night when Dog came home 
from work, Cat said she was too sick to make him dinner. Dog was patient with 
this talk for a while, but he soon got fed up with making dinner for them both 
after a hard day's work. After all, Cat just stayed home all day long.<br>
 One 
day, Dog told Cat he was going to work, but instead he hid in the cupboard and 
watched Cat to see if she really was sick. As soon as Cat thought Dog had left, 
she started playing games with Kitten. They laughed and ran about. Cat wasn't 
the least bit sick.<br>
 Dog jumped out of the cupboard. When Cat saw him, she 
stuck a marble in her cheek and told Dog she had a toothache. Dog got so angry 
that he started chasing her around and around the house. And Dogs have been 
chasing Cats ever since <br>
