healthily? <br>

<h2>  How can I feed my cat healthily? </h2> 
<p>Like all animals, your cat needs a diet that's properly balanced and 
contains all the required nutrients in correct quantities. These nutrients are 
water, protein, fats and oils, carbohydrate, minerals and vitamins.Any 
manufactured pet food should provide your cat with this basic nutritional 
balance. The choice of serving canned or dry, or a mixture of the two, is 
really a matter of personal preference between you and your cat. Recent 
developments in pet nutrition mean there is now a wide range of commercially 
produced cat foods designed to match more accurately your cat's specific needs. 
If your cat spends most of his time indoors, for example, he may benefit from a 
special indoor formula, while less-active cats require less fat, so feeding a 
'light' formula could help to avoid weight gain.</p> 
<p>You can feed your cat on wet or dry food, or a combination of both. Some 
cats prefer to be fed wet food in the morning, for example, but have dry food 
left out during the day to snack on. Unlike many dogs, cats prefer to crunch on 
their dry food and generally find it less attractive when soaked, so keep it 
dry.</p> 
<p>With dry food, you can expect your cat to chew it more actively and take 
longer to eat; to drink more water; and to return regularly to the food rather 
than eating it all at once. Dry food is convenient in that it will stay fresh 
all day, so it can be left out for your cat to eat whenever it wants. Dry food 
must, however, be stored in a dry, clean environment. With wet foods cats tend 
to eat more in one sitting rather than going back and forth, and will drink 
less. Serve the food at room temperature to ensure your cat can taste and smell 
it properly. Warming up an opened can may take up to two hours from being taken 
out of the fridge, microwaving canned foods for a short time is always an 
option. Don't keep wet food opened for longer than 24 hours as it will go off 
and cause upset tummies.</p> 
<p>Make sure fresh drinking water is always available for your cat, but don't 
give cow's milk. Cow's milk isn't suitable for cats, as most cats lose the 
ability to digest lactose shortly after weaning. Pastuerised yoghurt doesn't 
contain lactose, however, so this can be an alternative for some cats.</p> 
<p>Remember also that cats are confirmed meat eaters and cats will go blind, 
suffer other debilitating conditions and ultimately die if fed on a vegetarian 
diet. Meat is the only major source of arachidonic acid, and cats lacking the 
ability to synthesize niacin from protein. Cats need meat to survive!</p> 
<p>It's always a good idea to feed on a surface that is easily cleaned, like a 
tiled floor or a mat. Place feeding bowls away from the litter tray and, if you 
have two cats, keep the bowls a reasonable distance apart to avoid 
confrontations or bullying. Ensure you provide clean, fresh water in a large 
metal or ceramic bowl. This helps to keep the kidneys healthy and reduce the 
risk of Urinary infections.</p> 
<p>Older cats may benefit from an adjustment to their diet, changing to foods 
that are more easily diet, changing to foods that are more easily digested.</p>
