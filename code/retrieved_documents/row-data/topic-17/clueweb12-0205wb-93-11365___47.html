<p><b>It's official, we're zoned: commissioners approve map </b></p> 
<p><b>By James Robinson </b></p> 
<p><b>Staff Writer</b></p> 
<p>With Tuesday's commissioner approval of a county zoning map, Archuleta 
County has joined the ranks of most Colorado counties and of countless counties 
across the nation - Archuleta County is now a zoned county.</p> 
<p>The decision to approve the map came with little fanfare, and was made 
before an audience of about 25 people in the board of county commissioners 
meeting room, the bulk of whom were either Archuleta County or La Plata County 
staff - La Plata County sent planning staff to observe the proceedings.</p> 
<p>The approval marks the culmination of a multifaceted, multi-year project 
begun in 2001 with adoption of the Archuleta County Community Plan, and is the 
capstone event in a comprehensive overhaul of the county's land use regulations.
</p> 
<p>By identifying nine specific zoning districts, the map provides the 
framework from within which the recently adopted land use code can operate - 
specifically, section three regarding zoning regulations in the new county land 
use code adopted May 23, 2006.</p> 
<p>The nine zoning districts include: agriculture forestry, agriculture 
ranching, agriculture estate, rural residential, residential, mobile home park, 
commercial, industrial and planned unit development. The uses allowed for each 
zone are described in the new land use code.</p> 
<p>During Tuesday's adoption hearing, much of the discussion focused on 
mechanisms for achieving a re-zone of a property from its present zoning status.
</p> 
<p>According to interim Director of County Development David Alvord, the code 
provides ways to update and modify the map, including a plan for regular 
revisions.</p> 
<p>Aside from changes made during a scheduled revision, Alvord said there are 
two additional methods to obtain a zoning change. The first method would allow 
for a change, free of charge, due to a county oversight.</p> 
<p>&quot;If there was an oversight on our part, I think it's fair they don't 
pay anything,&quot; Alvord said.</p> 
<p>Alvord and Senior Planner Jason Peasley said, out of 17,000 parcels, about 
100 did not mesh neatly with the decision making process outlined in the Zoning 
Transition Program, and therefore, county staff is willing to look at tax 
records and other documentation that might provide clearer insight into those 
properties' best zoning designation and would make a change if necessary.</p> 
<p>The second, Alvord described as a taxpayer initiated re-zone. Under a 
taxpayer initiated re-zone request, the property was zoned correctly - based on 
the assessor's data as of Jan. 1, 2006 and adjacent land use - however, the 
taxpayer wants to change to another zoning status from their present zoning 
status.</p> 
<p>A taxpayer initiated re-zone request would then be put before county 
planners and the planning commission, and the board of county commissioner's 
would provide the ultimate approval or denial. Fees apply for the taxpayer 
initiated rezone.</p> 
<p>Gerald Dahl, county attorney for the project, said the land use regulations 
provide uniform standards for re-zoning, and in fact, &quot;the regs encourage 
the rezoning process,&quot; Dahl said.</p> 
<p>And Dahl described updating the map as &quot;a constant process of 
refinement and change.&quot;</p> 
<p>Approval of the color-coded map received a unanimous commissioner vote, and 
largely positive responses from those in attendance.</p> 
<p>Speaking for Alpha residents, Beverly Warburton said, &quot;We like the 
result, we're the right color green.&quot;</p> 
<p>The draft map is displayed at the Archuleta County Courthouse, at county 
planning offices and online at archuletacounty.org. A final version is 
forthcoming.</p>

<p><b>HD drilling: problems and public dollars</b></p> 
<p><b>By James Robinson</b></p> 
<p><b>Staff Writer</b></p> 
<p>With the recently released final environmental impact statement and the 
forthcoming record of decision detailing plans for coal bed methane drilling in 
the HD mountains, concerned citizens and an area environmental group opposed to 
the project are gearing up to make their worries heard.</p> 
<p>Bob Delzell, speaking as a private landowner living in the HDs near the 
Fruitland Outcrop, and as a member of the environmental group, the San Juan 
Citizens Alliance, voiced one of the group's primary concerns.</p> 
<p>&quot;The final EIS (environmental impact statement) has lots of problems. 
We don't favor drilling within a mile and half of the outcrop,&quot; Delzell 
said.</p> 
<p>However, despite thousands of comments similar to Delzell's, including 
formal statements from Archuleta and La Plata counties and the town councils of 
Bayfield, Ignacio and Durango opposing the drilling of new wells within the 
proposed 1.5 mile outcrop buffer zone, the EIS' preferred alternative allows 
gas companies to extract coal bed methane from wells drilled within the buffer 
zone area.</p> 
<p>According to Delzell, of the 85 wells proposed for the Archuleta County 
portion of the project area, 48 wells lie within the &quot;outcrop danger 
zone&quot; - one on the edge of the outcrop, 11 within half a mile of the 
outcrop, 10 within half to three quarters of a mile of the outcrop, and 26 
within three quarters to one and a half miles of the outcrop.</p> 
<p>Delzell said lessons learned from drilling within the 1.5 mile buffer zone 
in La Plata County, including a number of suspect, possibly methane caused 
fires, drawing down of the water table, water well issues and methane seeps, 
should have taught industry and government officials that drilling too close to 
the outcrop is risky business.</p> 
<p>&quot;The important issue is to stay away from the outcrop. I think its 
easiest to stay away from the outcrop for a mile and half,&quot; Delzell said.
</p> 
<p>And Delzell added that distance may be the best mitigation measure gas 
companies can use to avoid outcrop impacts, such as those seen in La Plata 
County, from occurring in Archuleta County.</p> 
<p>Of a long list of concerns, Delzell said drilling near the outcrop could 
deplete the water table, drying up or contaminating residential water wells and 
springs and seeps used to water livestock and pasture. In addition, Delzell 
said, the pressure created by underground water plays a critical role in 
holding the methane in place, and once water is removed during the drilling 
process, methane is free to flow not only out the well head, but could seep 
through cracks and fissures in the rock and possibly into residential water 
supplies or other sensitive or hazardous areas. And once the water is gone, 
Delzell said, it is possible for the coal to warm. And, if the coal is exposed 
to sufficient amounts of oxygen, it can reach a point where spontaneous 
combustion occurs, thus causing an underground coalbed fire.</p> 
<p>According to Delzell, EIS map 3.3 shows four locations for such fires, and 
possibly a fifth fire at the La Plata Mine, in the La Plata County portion of 
the project area near the New Mexico state line. The map also identifies gas 
seep locations. </p> 
<p>Speaking to the Archuleta County Board of County Commissioners last year, 
Pagosa Fire Protection District Chief Warren Grams said extinguishing an 
underground coalbed fire is an expensive, and extremely difficult process. 
Furthermore, Grams said, much of the Fruitland Outcrop area in Archuleta County 
lies in a fire fighter's no-man's-land, lying beyond the reaches of both the 
Pagosa Fire Protection District and the Upper Pine River Fire Protection 
District.</p> 
<p>In a July 18 presentation to the Archuleta County Board of County 
Commissioners, EIS team leader Walt Brown, said the EIS' preferred alternative 
acknowledges outcrop drilling concerns and &quot;requires geologic, hydrologic 
and gas reservoir information from test wells in less sensitive areas before 
development is considered in more sensitive areas within the 1.5 mile Outcrop 
buffer zone.&quot;</p> 
<p>In addition, Brown said the preferred alternative &quot;requires intensive 
monitoring to better characterize the hydrogeology of the Fruitland Formation 
and to detect potential impacts before they manifest at the Outcrop.&quot;</p> 
<p>Brown said monitoring and mitigation measures play key roles in the EIS' 
preferred alternative, but a statement from the San Juan Citizens Alliance 
calls those measures &quot;vague, voluntary and unenforceable.&quot;</p> 
<p>According to the group, the EIS outlines a plan to monitor water wells and 
vegetation along the outcrop for signs of methane seepage. If methane seepage 
is detected and there is &quot;reasonable evidence&quot; that suggests a link 
between the drilling and the methane seep, water well contamination, or impacts 
to vegetation, the Forest Service can force operators to cease production. </p> 
<p>Delzell calls this type of monitoring and mitigation too little too late, 
and said once the impacts can be observed or monitored, the damage to the 
environment, the water table, and to human health and safety is already done.
</p> 
<p>According to Brown, of the 20,000 inventoried acres in the HD Mountains 
Roadless Area, roughly 8,000 have been identified as unsuitable for drilling or 
drilling infrastructure based on current coal bed methane extraction 
techniques. That leaves about 12,000 acres potentially open to drilling with, 
under the preferred alternative, 72 miles of new roads and 227 new wells - 100 
on private land and 127 on federal land in the roadless area. For the Archuleta 
County portion of the project area, that means 140 new wells in undeveloped 
portions of the county.</p> 
<p>And while individuals such as Delzell and groups such as the San Juan 
Citizens Alliance and the HD Mountains Coalition harbor grave concerns over 
drilling near the outcrop and in the HDs, with 140 new wells on the horizon, 
Archuleta County is poised to reap tax benefits from unprecedented gas 
production,</p> 
<p>According to Archuleta County Assessor Keren Prior, the assessed value for 
oil and gas production on the 2005 Abstract of Assessment, totaled about$ 4.4 
million. Oil and gas personal property on the same abstract showed a total 
assessment of $861,650.</p> 
<p>With Prior's preliminary assessment figures in for this year, assessed 
value for oil and gas production and personal property have bounded 
exponentially.</p> 
<p>According to Prior, the assessed value for oil and gas production jumped to 
$8.6 million while oil and gas personal property jumped to $2.3 million. Those 
assessments, once finalized, will translate into tax dollars for Archuleta 
County - tax dollars that can be used to fund numerous county projects 
including county facilities, services and roads.</p> 
<p>At recent meetings, Archuleta County Administrator Bob Campbell and Finance 
Director Bob Burchett both said gas production in the Archuleta County portion 
of the HDs project area would be a boon for the county, and may provide one of 
the keys for solving the county's long term road maintenance issues.</p> 
<p>Prior said, &quot;Oil and gas will subsidize all of us,&quot; and she 
explained that every taxing entity, from the fire district to the library and 
hospital district stand to benefit from increases in oil and gas production.</p>
<p>But while many Archuleta County staff stand ready to reap the benefits of 
coal bed methane production, Delzell, the HD Mountains Coalition and the San 
Juan Citizens Alliance are preparing to shed light on the fallout of drilling 
in the HD Mountains Roadless Area and near the Fruitland Outcrop.</p> 
<p>To that end, the coalition is hosting a public information meeting and 
public comment forum 7 p.m. Aug. 28 at Bayfield High School. Public comments 
made at the meeting will be delivered to the Forest Service and Bureau of Land 
Management as the agencies develop and draft their final Record of Decision for 
the EIS.</p>

<p><b>Library district to seek mill levy increase</b></p> 
<p><b>By Louis Sherman</b></p> 
<p><b>Staff Writer</b></p> 
<p>The Upper San Juan Library District has delivered a ballot question to 
county and town officials, asking for a 1.5 mill increase to its mill levy.</p> 
<p>The increase would double the district's mill levy, raising it from 1.5 to 
three mills.</p> 
<p>Carole Howard, spokesperson for the mill levy committee, said that the levy 
increase will only raise property taxes about $22 per year, on an average home 
valued at $184,641 (determined by the county assessor, not the market).</p> 
<p>If approved, there would be an annual total of around $45 in property tax 
on the average home to fund the Upper San Juan Library District.</p> 
<p>The opening lines of the ballot question read:</p> 
<p>&quot;Shall the Upper San Juan Library District's taxes be increased by 
three hundred fifty-two thousand dollars ($352,000.00) (first fiscal year 
dollar increase) and by whatever additional amounts are raised annually 
thereafter by an additional ad valorem property tax levy of one and one half 
(1.5) mills ... &quot;</p> 
<p>This is the first time that the library district has asked for a mill levy 
increase, since it was originally instituted.</p> 
<p>&quot;We've never asked the public for money before ... We've built the 
building and that's all we can do,&quot; said Barbara Draper of the library 
staff.</p> 
<p>According to Draper, the current building was constructed debt-free, and no 
taxpayer dollars were used for its recent expansion.</p> 
<p>If the mill levy increase is approved, the library will look to improve its 
offerings, including programs and collections.</p> 
<p>The library is currently surveying the public to see what services and book 
selections people would like to see improved. The surveys will be collected 
until the end of August.</p> 
<p>The Upper San Juan Library District will begin a campaign to promote the 
ballot issue after Labor Day. </p>

<p><b>Identity of election night announcer unknown </b></p> 
<p><b>By James Robinson </b></p> 
<p><b>Staff Writer</b></p> 
<p>The Aug. 10 issue of The SUN reported the results of the Archuleta County 
sheriff's primary were broadcast first over an Archuleta County radio 
frequency, and prior to the county clerks's formal announcement of the election 
results.</p> 
<p>Discussions with Shana Young, dispatch supervisor, indicate that, although 
the message was broadcast on radio waves travelling county-wide, dispatch staff 
did not make the announcement.</p> 
<p>Young asserts that the female voice, heard at approximately 9:45 p.m., was 
not one of the dispatch staffers on duty on primary election night. Young said 
for a dispatcher to have announced election results would have been extremely 
unprofessional.</p> 
<p>To date, the identity of the unauthorized and unidentified radio announcer 
remains unknown.</p>

<p><b>LPEA participates in energy saving program </b></p> 
<p>LPEA has joined the ENERGY STAR&reg; Change a Light, Change the World 
campaign, a growing community of corporations, utilities, manufacturers, 
individuals, and countless others who have made a commitment to change the 
world, one light - one energy-saving step - at a time.</p> 
<p>As part of this national movement, LPEA has volunteered to encourage at 
least 100 individuals to pledge to replace at least one incandescent bulb or 
fixture at home with one that has earned the government's ENERGY STAR label - 
as a first step to preserve our energy resources and environment. LPEA hopes to 
achieve this goal on or before Oct. 4, 2006, National ENERGY STAR Change a 
Light Day. 100 pledges could save 28,200 kWh of energy and prevent 44,600 
pounds of greenhouse gas emissions.</p> 
<p>To be part of LPEA's efforts, visit LPEA's website at www.lpea.coop and 
follow the Change a Light, Change the World link.</p> 
<p>&quot;Like many organizations, we want to do our part to create a better 
environment,&quot; said Greg Munro, LPEA chief executive officer. 
&quot;Participating in this national campaign is both easy and effective. We 
are proud to spread the word about the simple steps individuals in our 
community can take to make a difference.&quot;</p> 
<p>LPEA will take an active role in encouraging individuals to make a simple, 
yet meaningful commitment by taking the online ENERGY STAR Change a Light 
Pledge. With lighting accounting for up to 20 percent of the typical home's 
electricity use, switching to energy-efficient options is a significant way to 
reduce greenhouse gases, save energy and protect the environment for future 
generations.</p> 
<p>&quot;Committing to change the world takes less time and energy than you 
might think. In fact, it can start with simply changing a light,&quot; said 
Wendy Reed of the Environmental Protection Agency. &quot;Organizations like 
LPEA are an important part of the ENERGY STAR Change a Light community, who 
have committed their time to help us spread the word about the Change a Light 
Pledge. We are proud to work with them and with the thousands of Americans 
who've already taken the pledge to make a difference for this generation and 
those to come.&quot;</p> 
<p>The ENERGY STAR Change a Light Pledge is already having a dramatic impact. 
Pledges taken to-date will result in the reduction of more than 23 million kWh 
of energy and 33 million pounds of greenhouse gas emissions.</p> 
<p>The ENERGY STAR Change a Light, Change the World campaign is a national 
challenge sponsored by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the U.S. 
Department of Energy, to encourage Americans to consider the energy they use 
and to switch to light bulbs and fixtures that have earned the government's 
ENERGY STAR for energy efficiency.</p> 
<p>ENERGY STAR was introduced by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in 
1992 as a voluntary, market-based partnership to reduce air pollution through 
increased energy efficiency. Today, with assistance from the U.S. Department of 
Energy, the ENERGY STAR program offers businesses and consumers 
energy-efficient solutions to save energy and money, and help protect our 
environment for future generations. More than 8,000 organizations have become 
ENERGY STAR partners and are committed to improving the energy efficiency of 
products, homes and businesses. For more information about ENERGY STAR, visit

<p><b>New staff starts work at Stevens Field </b></p> 
<p><b>By Chuck McGuire</b></p> 
<p><b>Staff Writer</b></p> 
<p>Faced with a number of pressing issues, three new Stevens Field staff 
members have hit the ground running.</p> 
<p>Of course, the entire Archuleta County airport work force consists of just 
three people, with Gena DeWinter being the first among them to settle into her 
position as administrative assistant. DeWinter began work at the airport July 
5, after transferring from the Archuleta County Assessor's office, where she 
toiled for better than three years. DeWinter replaces Jennifer Chavez, who now 
works in county finance.</p> 
<p>Airport Maintenance Specialist Chris Torres assumed his duties earlier this 
month, after transferring from the county solid waste department. He worked 
there for more than a year, before replacing longtime Airport Maintenance 
Specialist Chris Scarpa. Scarpa also transferred to another county department 
and now acts as building and grounds supervisor.</p> 
<p>George Barter took over as airport manager Aug. 7. He was chosen from a 
list of 15 applicants to replace former manager Rob Russ, who resigned in 
April. Barter retired from the Department of Justice at the end of July, and 
took up permanent residence in his Pagosa Springs home a few days later.</p> 
<p>Barter has 25 years of aviation experience, with five years in aviation 
management. He has directed all aspects of aviation projects with budgets up to 
$9 million, including soliciting and reviewing bids from vendors, and 
establishing and maintaining vendor relations to ensure project completion. He 
is a pilot with licenses to fly both fixed- and rotary-wing aircraft, and 
recently flew for the Justice Department in multiple capacities.</p> 
<p>In light of current growth and ongoing airport renovation projects, staff 
now faces a series of challenges that entail deadlines, construction concerns 
and some funding constraints.</p> 
<p>By press time, DeWinter was working on state and Federal Aviation Agency 
reimbursement requests for land acquisition costs related to the proposed 
parallel taxiway, and Barter was &quot;up to his ears&quot; in 2007 budget 
matters. Barter said budget requests must be submitted to county finance by 
Sept. 8, and as part of the process, he has asked the Archuleta County Airport 
Advisory Commission (ACAAC) for project requests and funding recommendations.
</p> 
<p>Among other things, the commission expressed a vehement desire to address 
the current surface condition of the north ramp, or the area where visiting 
aircraft owners park their planes. Apparently the ramp's asphalt surface has 
deteriorated significantly and loose gravel, which poses a serious safety 
threat to aircraft engines, has resulted in certain pilots refusing to park 
there. Unfortunately, the proposed fix is costly, at an estimated $55,000.</p> 
<p>The commission also asked that priority be given to finding a new permanent 
location for the self-service fuel farm. The farm is supposed to make aviation 
fuel available to pilots after hours, but its present location is neither safe 
nor feasible. Consequently, it is currently inoperable and causes the county 
and Avjet, the fixed base operator, significant revenue losses. Once a final 
site is agreed upon, the estimated expense to move it is about $17,000.</p> 
<p>The commission has also expressed concern with the airport's aging 
maintenance equipment. Though weed mowing was underway by press time, the 
airport tractor has reportedly broken down several times, even to the point of 
borrowing one from another county department.</p> 
<p>Ironically, that tractor also broke down and is now awaiting repair. 
Meanwhile, the airport tractor has been repaired enough to cut weeds for now, 
but its days are apparently numbered.</p> 
<p>Another item on the ACAAC wish list involves the installation of an 
Automated Weather Observing System (AWOS). Final FAA approval of a proposed 
AWOS location is necessary before the equipment can be assembled, but once the 
FAA gives the go-ahead, the system could be in place by early October. 
According to commission officials, &quot;its costs have already been 
covered.&quot;</p> 
<p>At an Archuleta County Board of County Commissioners meeting Aug. 15, the 
board approved the opening of approximately 12 acres of airport property to 
ground leases for the eventual construction of approximately 35 aircraft 
hangers. The acreage is located just south of the new fixed base operations 
center (near mid-field), and already contains eight hangers.</p> 
<p>Roughly 30 aircraft owners have expressed interest in building hangers at 
the site, and those eventually chosen will pay the county $.38 per square foot 
for the ground. Owners will be responsible for the cost of the structure and 
any amenities, and the county is considering a cost reduction, in exchange for 
owner assistance in adding utilities or other infrastructure. A newly crafted 
ground lease document is now awaiting BoCC approval.</p>

<p><b>San Juan Historical Society releases new book </b></p> 
<p><b>By Shari Pierce</b></p> 
<p><b>Special to The SUN</b></p> 
<p>The San Juan Historical Society announces the release of Volume 11 of its 
popular &quot;Remembrances&quot; series of books.</p> 
<p>The series is compiled by museum volunteers and is dedicated to collecting 
and publishing the history of Pagosa Springs, Archuleta County and the 
surrounding area.</p> 
<p>Volume 11 is entitled &quot;Federal Forest Reserves.&quot; It looks at the 
history of The San Juan National Forest, which was created June 3, 1905, by 
proclamation of the President of the United States.</p> 
<p>&quot;Remembrances&quot; series editor Glenn Raby writes, &quot;The mission 
of the federal forests has been to manage the natural resources and human use 
and enjoyment of this unique and priceless heritage of the American people, not 
for unaltered preservation, but for sustained production of those things a 
forest gives us and that we all need: wildlife, water, wood, natural beauty, 
history, home and future.&quot;</p> 
<p>Volume 11 is a local collection of memories of the people who managed, 
worked for and enjoyed our forest. It includes writings from Florence Self's 
journal. Self was employed by the forest service to man the Eight Mile Lookout 
tower. She spent many hours in the wooden tower watching out for forest fires. 
Her writings are delightful.</p> 
<p>This volume includes selected ranger reports from the 1930s and 1940s 
outlining projects completed under the forest service along with bits of local 
history. There is also a scrapbook of forest-related photographs.</p> 
<p>As do previous volumes, &quot;Remembrances Volume 11&quot; ends with the 
Founding Families section. This includes stories submitted by families whose 
ancestors helped settle and form the town and county. In this volume the Amyx 
and Bramwell families share their stories. Also included in this section is a 
story about the heavy snows of 1931 and the rescue of men on the Wolf Creek 
Pass road maintenance crew during that time.</p> 
<p>Volumes in the &quot;Remembrances&quot; series are available at the San 
Juan Historical Society Museum. Cost is $25 per volume with proceeds going to 
maintain the museum and its collection of artifacts from area history. The 
museum is located at 96 Pagosa Street.</p> 
<p>The series is also available at Moonlight Books on Pagosa Street. </p> 
<p>Monthly meetings</p> 
<p>The San Juan Historical Society meets the first Thursday of each month at 6 
p.m. Meetings in the summer are held at the museum and in the winter are held 
at the Chamber of Commerce Visitor's Center. Please join the society and help 
ensure the future of the museum.</p> 
<p>Membership</p>

<p>The next two months will require an effective campaign since, as a write-in 
candidate, Woodruff's name will not appear on the ballot.</p> 
<p>Woodruff is currently on the town planning commission and works for a local 
title company. She has been the chief title officer for one year and was a 
title examiner for four years.</p> 
<p>Woodruff also worked as deputy clerk in Archuleta County for four years.</p>
<p>She has lived in the county for 10 years.</p> 
<p>Aside from meeting the filing deadline, an eligible write-in candidate must 
live in the county for at least one year. They must also be a registered member 
of their party for at least one year before running.</p> 
<p>If elected, Woodruff says she will improve the functioning of the 
assessor's office</p> 
<p>Woodruff is challenging incumbent Keren Prior, also a Republican, now in 
her eighth year as assessor.</p> 
<p>Prior is a licensed real estate appraiser and is the chair of the Colorado 
Board of Real Estate Appraisers. She also sits on the Sixth Judicial District 
Nominating Commission, which nominates candidates for the state supreme court.
</p> 
<p>Prior has lived in the county since 1994 and worked in real estate since 
the 1970s.</p> 
<p>Both candidates are now gearing up for a short campaign. Woodruff must 
start by getting her name out.</p> 
<p>With Woodruff's candidacy announcement, the assessor's race is now 
contested. However, following release of official primary election results from 
Madrid, the results of the recent sheriff's primary election are not.</p> 
<p>At final count, Pete Gonzalez maintained his win, garnering 10 more votes 
for a total count of 1,196. Bob Grandchamp, took in one more vote for a total 
of 259, and Steve Wadley also took an additional vote for a total of 611 votes.

<p><b>District to hold groundbreaking ceremony for new hospital </b></p> 
<p><b>By Chuck McGuire</b></p> 
<p><b>Staff Writer</b></p> 
<p>And, so it begins.</p> 
<p>The Upper San Juan Health Service District Board of Directors and the Dr. 
Mary Fisher Medical Foundation Board are planning a special groundbreaking 
ceremony to celebrate the start of constructing a new Critical Access Hospital 
in Pagosa Springs. The public is cordially invited, with festivities beginning 
at 5 p.m. Tuesday, Sept. 5.</p> 
<p>The event will take place at the Dr. Mary Fisher Medical Center at 95 South 
Pagosa Blvd. Refreshments will be served, and architectural drawings of the 
planned facility will be on display.</p> 
<p>In a special election last May, voters overwhelmingly approved a measure 
allowing the USJHSD to increase debt by $12 million to build the hospital. 
Since then, the district board has worked feverishly to raise private donations 
and finalize financing arrangements.</p> 
<p>Design and construction details have changed periodically, as estimated 
costs have increased, but construction will now begin soon after the 
groundbreaking.</p> 
<p>Board members believe the entire project will take approximately 14 months 
to build, with the hospital opening its doors for business by late 2007.</p>

<p>Perhaps the return to school, school clothing and supplies are not on your 
mind.</p> 
<p>These things are, however, are on the minds of many parents and students in 
Archuleta County as the return to school grows near.</p> 
<p>For many lower income families, providing school supplies may stretch the 
family budget already made tighter by rising energy costs.</p> 
<p>Operation Helping Hand, a group of dedicated citizens, has been assisting 
those in need for more than 15 years now. The organization is currently 
collecting donations of school supplies for area children.</p> 
<p>You can help OHH make someone's first day of school (and in fact the entire 
school year) a brighter one by contributing some supplies.</p> 
<p>In 2005, 95 students in grades K through 12 were assisted through this 
program.</p> 
<p>Organizers report that donations are low this year and many more are needed 
to meet the need of our community's students.</p> 
<p>Those who wish to make monetary donations to the drive may send them to 
Operation Helping Hand, Wells Fargo Bank, account number 6240417424, or Bank of

school supplies and clothing vouchers to be distributed to those identified as 
needing assistance at this time of the year.</p> 
<p>Below is a list of items being collected by Operation Helping Hand. It was 
compiled using supply lists provided by local schools. You can drop off your

<p><b>Land Trust presents program to celebrate 25th year </b></p> 
<p><b>By Nancy Cole</b></p> 
<p><b>Special to The SUN</b></p> 
<p>The Southwest Land Alliance is presenting a day-long series Oct. 6 called 
&quot;Saving the Ranch,&quot; to celebrate its 25th year in operation and the 
important acreage being conserved in this area.</p> 
<p>This program at the Pagosa Springs Community Center will provide 
information about the whys and hows of conservation easements today with guest 
speakers from around the region. It is open to anyone interested in land 
issues, taxes, estate planning or conservation. For information contact the 
Southwest Land Alliance office (261-7779) or one of its board members noted 
below.</p> 
<p>Twenty-five years ago, in late 1981, a group of dedicated local people 
wishing to promote conservation of the beautiful land in southwestern Colorado, 
created a nonprofit organization to encourage and protect conservation 
easements. The initial board of directors of the nonprofit organization, listed 
in a January 1982 issue of The Pagosa Springs SUN, were identified as Betty 
Feazel, Dr. Allan Handy, Jock Jacober, Carl Macht, Genelle Macht, Joe Moore and 
Vicki Ray.</p> 
<p>The local land trust was renamed the Southwest Land Alliance in 1987 and 
again a number of familiar local persons signed the new incorporation document 
that included the name change - Herbert Brodsky, Bruce Bailey, Gordon Jacober, 
Genelle Macht and Joseph Moore.</p> 
<p>These farsighted people and local ranchers who availed themselves of 
conservation easements as a way to preserve their land for their heirs, and to 
benefit the larger community, created a public land trust that today protects 
over 13,000 acres of productive ranches and beautiful forests in Archuleta and 
surrounding counties.</p> 
<p>A conservation easement is an easement on land for the purpose of 
protecting its important characteristics. The landowner continues to own the 
land, but the use of the land is restricted to activities that do not impair 
the so-called &quot;conservation values&quot; that the landowner specifies in 
the conservation easement. A public, nonprofit agency, usually a public land 
trust, holds the easement and is responsible for protecting its conservation 
values in perpetuity.</p> 
<p>The use of conservation easements is encouraged as a matter of public 
policy by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and many states. The IRS treats the 
value given up by putting land in a conservation easement as a charitable gift 
deductible from state and federal taxes. The value of this gift is the 
difference in the value of the land without the easement restrictions 
(available for development) and the value with the restrictions.</p> 
<p>Originally, the federal tax advantage was the primary financial benefit to 
the landowner for putting land in a conservation easement. In the last several 
years a number of states, Colorado among them, recognized that many landowners 
are depending on their land to produce funds for retirement or for their heirs. 
Thus, they need greater financial compensation and incentive for donating the 
development rights on their land.</p> 
<p>Recognizing this need and the value of productive open land to its 
citizens, Colorado initiated a tax credit system extending the federal 
&quot;gift&quot; idea to Colorado taxes. However, the greatest benefits to 
landowners have come more recently with the extension of the state income tax 
credit system to make it possible to sell one's tax credits on the open market 
to people who have sufficient income to need the tax credits. This means that 
ranchers can actually receive cash for their tax credits on a conservation 
easement today.</p> 
<p>The Southwest Land Alliance grew gradually in its first decades as an 
almost totally volunteer effort of concerned local citizens. However, as the 
legal complexities and numbers of conservation easements have grown, the need 
for professional staff has increased. From a half-time professional (Linda 
Newberry) in the recent past, staff increased to a full-time executive 
director, Michael Whiting, in 2005 and now a second full-time professional, 
Karin Freeman, in 2006.</p> 
<p>The organization continues to operate under a voluntary local board 
including Jan Brookshier, Bob Bruchett, Nancy Cole, Alan Farrow, Penny Holmes, 
Ralph Holsworth, Bill Nobles, Dennis Schutz and Mark Weiler. The primary 
function of the organization continues to be holding conservation easements and 
protecting them in perpetuity. The costs of the activities of monitoring 
easements annually and taking action required to protect their conservation 
values is funded primarily by endowments to the SLA contributed by the 
landowners themselves and by citizens supporting conservation in the community.
</p> 
<p>The &quot;Saving the Ranch&quot; program is being funded by local sponsors 
and all of the special guest speakers have volunteered their time.</p> 
<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p> 
<p><b>Conservation district offers seed program </b></p> 
<p>The San Juan Conservation District is offering local landowners the 
opportunity to purchase a variety of seed mixtures for different conservation 
uses such as erosion control, weed suppression and grazing land improvement.</p>
<p>The mixtures have been specially developed to provide a ground cover that 
requires minimal watering and include a native grass mixture, dryland pasture 
mix, native wildflower mix and a new mix called &quot;wildlife mix.&quot;</p> 
<p>Mixes are ideal for establishing vegetation around newly constructed homes 
or to improve pasture condition. Erosion control blankets are also available.
</p> 
<p>The district will accept orders until Sept. 15 and the seed will be 
available for pickup Oct. 3.</p> 
<p>For more information, or to obtain an order form, contact the San Juan 
Conservation District at 731-3615, or visit the office at 505A CR 600 (Piedra 
Road). The office is located next to Piedra Automotive.</p>

<p><b>Region 9 completes survey of second home owners </b></p> 
<p>The Region 9 Economic Development District of Southwest Colorado has 
completed their survey of second homeowners in Archuleta, La Plata, Dolores, 
San Juan and Montezuma counties.</p> 
<p>To encourage participation in the survey, Region 9 offered $600 in cash 
prizes. The winners are Tim and Lydia Ortiz of Pagosa Springs, $300; Marla C. 
Underall, $200; and Carla Vaivoda of Archuleta County, $100.</p> 
<p>The survey portion is Phase Two of Region 9's Social and Economic Impact of 
2nd Homes Study. This survey portion sought information about why second 
homeowners decide to buy property in our region, and look at their future plans 
in our area.</p> 
<p>Phase One of the study compiled property information for each of the five 
counties and compiled information about the property locations, age, size and 
improvements made by second homeowners. Second homeowners were defined as 
persons with mailing addresses outside the county where they own property.</p> 
<p>The final piece of the puzzle is to determine how second homes affect 
population growth, local job and housing markets, and their impacts on 
infrastructure such as transportation corridors and community services. Results 
of this Phase III will be available later in the fall.</p> 
<p>The research of both completed phases of the study are available at Region 
9's Web site, www.scan.org. Feedback is welcome.</p>

<p><b>Variety of programs available to local dog and cat owners </b></p> 
<p><b>By Sarah O. Smith</b></p> 
<p><b>Staff Writer </b></p> 
<p>For many, dogs and cats offer incomparable friendship and comfort. To 
return the favor, it is important for all pet owners to ensure the health and 
well-being of their pets, no matter what the expense.</p> 
<p>However, when faced with the daunting veterinarian bills that new pets 
often bring, many pet owners don't know where to begin.</p> 
<p>Luckily, Pagosa is home to a number of options for dog and cat owners to 
lower their costs on the basic, yet vital medical care their pets require, such 
as spay and neuter operations and yearly vaccinations.</p> 
<p>Robbie Schwartz, director of the Humane Society of Pagosa Springs, said 
spaying or neutering your pet is an integral step in lowering the number of 
homeless dogs and cats. The Humane society began their pet overpopulation 
program in 1995, and since 2001 the number of homeless pets has reduced eight 
percent.</p> 
<p>The pet overpopulation program includes a number of ways to make sure your 
pet receives this important operation. Based upon your income, you may qualify 
for the Fix-It-Free program, in which the Humane Society gives out free spay or 
neuter vouchers which can be used at local veterinarians.</p> 
<p>&quot;The local vets are very supportive of the program. They work with 
(the pet owners),&quot; said Schwartz.</p> 
<p>The vouchers are given out on the first day of the month on a first-come, 
first-served basis. To qualify, household income may not exceed $16,000 for a 
single person, $18,000 for two people, $20,000 for three people, $26,000 for 
four people, $28,000 for five people, and $30,000 for six or more people. You 
must show proof of your income, and the Humane Society accepts income tax 
returns, food stamp cards, or a letter from Social Services.</p> 
<p>Also, anyone who owns a purebred Staffordshire bull terrier (Pit Bull) or a 
Staffordshire bull terrier mix will qualify for a Fix-It-Free voucher 
regardless of income.</p> 
<p>The Humane Society also offers Spay Aid, which has no income restrictions. 
With Spay Aid, the Humane Society will pay half of the bill to have your pet 
spayed or neutered. Again, a limited number of vouchers are given out on the 
first of each month.</p> 
<p>Other free programs are also offered for feral cats, and also dogs or cats 
who have recently had a litter. Also, for any dog or cat adopted from the 
Humane Society, the surgery and vaccinations are included in the price of 
adopting - $65 for dogs and $22.50 for cats. Since bills for spaying or 
neutering alone can run anywhere from $100 to $300, this bargain price is just 
another impetus to give a shelter dog or cat a loving home.</p> 
<p>All in all, Schwartz said the Humane Society spends about $30,000 per year 
on sterilization surgeries. And it's well worth it; she said in cities such as 
Farmington where no spay and neuter discounts or requirements are offered for 
the public, at least 1,000 animals are euthanized per month during the summer, 
most of them young puppies and kittens.</p> 
<p>&quot;The answer to the problem with pet population is not 
euthanization,&quot; said Schwartz. &quot;It's to stop the problem before it 
begins.&quot;</p> 
<p>Schwartz said last year the Humane Society took in 446 strays and 
owner-surrendered animals. This year that number fell to 407, proof that the 
pet overpopulation program is working.</p> 
<p>&quot;So the numbers are still dropping,&quot; she said.</p> 
<p>Once a pet has been spayed or neutered, owners can rest assured they've 
done their part to lower the number of homeless animals. However, medical care 
doesn't stop there; dogs and cats require yearly trips to the vet for 
vaccinations against diseases such as rabies, distemper, parvo, leptospirosis, 
and feline leukemia. Add in overall wellness exams and medications for 
heartworm and other common ailments, and pet owners may again be facing 
expensive bills.</p> 
<p>But once again, the Humane Society works in conjunction with local vets to 
keep those costs down. During the Humane Society's biannual Adopt-a-Thon, local 
vets take turns offering discounted vaccination clinics, where shots run just 
$11 a pop.</p> 
<p>Once they have an established relationship with their veterinarian and are 
confident in their pet's health status, some pet owners decide to take basic 
health care into their own hands. Many feed stores or equine suppliers sell 
package vaccinations for dogs and cats. The seven-way dog shot usually runs 
anywhere from $4 to $6. The five-way cat shot is generally more expensive since 
it contains the feline leukemia vaccination, and can cost up to $12. However, 
none of these shots include the extremely vital rabies vaccination, since 
Colorado law requires that all rabies shots be administered by a veterinarian.
</p> 
<p>Everyone knows that owning a pet isn't all fun. New pets can mean hard work 
and, oftentimes, big bills. However, with the number of options offered in 
Pagosa to reduce costs, the excitement and joy that new pets bring don't have 
to be deflated by a hefty bill.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p> <b>High Country Reflections</b> 
<p></p> 
<p><b>Cutthroats amid the forest gloom </b></p> 
<p><b>By Chuck McGuire</b></p> 
<p><b>SUN Columnist</b></p> 
<p>Even as I finished the last of my morning errands, towering cumulonimbus 
building over the north range were also backing steadily toward town. Within 
minutes, as I pulled into a filling station for fuel, the sky above grew dark 
and foreboding. Sharp chilly gusts tousled the aspens and ponderosas in nearby 
yards, and loud low-based thunder rumbled repeatedly across the valley.</p> 
<p>At once, as the cloudburst finally opened, accompanied by an intense volley 
of pea-sized hail, I feared my plan for an afternoon of fishing was rapidly 
fading.</p> 
<p>Earlier, I'd packed a light lunch and a small cooler of cold beverages. My 
hat, fishing pack and waders were already in the Jeep, and upon leaving the 
house, I'd grabbed a four-weight Leonard and suitable raised-pillar reel for 
what I hoped would be a quiet interlude of classic dry-fly fishing for native 
cutthroat trout.</p> 
<p>Over the years, as my outlook on flyfishing gradually evolved, various 
tactics held singular appeal. In the beginning, I simply wanted to catch trout 
with a flyrod and fly. After awhile, I focused on fooling them with 
conventional dry flies, and for a time, I fished only custom flies of my own 
creation.</p> 
<p>At first, I favored short fiberglass rods. Soon after, longer lighter ones 
of graphite composite seemed state-of-the-art. Today, I'm partial to 
tried-and-true split bamboo rods designed by the early masters, including the 
Leonard.</p> 
<p>As a result, I am now most content with taking fish on standard dry flies, 
particularly when the rod is bamboo, the flies imitate true adult aquatic 
insects, and the fish are colorful little natives whose local bloodlines date 
back to the end of the ice age.</p> 
<p>I pulled out of the gas station and headed toward a primitive forest road 
leading into the high-country. Strong gusty winds brought sheets of driving 
rain against my windshield, but the hail had tapered off some, and I could 
faintly see a bright spot with a slight hint of blue in the sky to the north.
</p> 
<p>With an hour-long drive ahead, before reaching the small tributary where I 
planned to fish, I thought to travel at least that far, then further assess 
weather conditions. After all, in a worst-case scenario, I could always sit in 
the Jeep and enjoy a leisurely lunch, while watching what could very well be a 
continuing round of robust thunderstorms.</p> 
<p>After just a few miles, however, the rain lessened to a light sprinkle. The 
dark clouds that only moments before were an ominous gun barrel blue, 
brightened considerably with occasional brief appearances by the sun. A few 
miles more, as I turned from pavement onto gravel, the surrounding landscape 
quickly dried under the warmth of increasing sunshine.</p> 
<p>At some point, about where the road narrows to a single lane, it penetrates 
dense old-growth forests of aspen, ponderosa pine and white fir. Like most 
high-elevation roads, it roughly parallels a cascading mountain stream, as it 
gradually climbs toward designated wilderness and thick stands of Douglas fir, 
Engelmann spruce and Colorado blue spruce. Even aspens in the lower reaches are 
huge, as they stretch ever upward in the shadows of soaring volcanic cliffs on 
either side of the creek.</p> 
<p>Wildlife abounds and the further I go, the slower I drive. Every trip in, 
it seems, I see a number of mule deer, often including a nice buck or two. Elk 
cows and calves are not uncommon, and though sightings are rare, big bulls, 
black bears and mountain lions are certainly in the area from time to time.</p> 
<p>Skunks, porcupines, coyotes and foxes have crossed my path on more than a 
few occasions and, while I've never actually seen one here, I have discovered 
recent bobcat tracks on a few local game trails between road's end and the 
river.</p> 
<p>Today, for that matter, it wouldn't be much of a stretch to hope for a 
glimpse of a Canada lynx, since more than 200 now run wild here in the San Juan 
Mountains.</p> 
<p>Needless to say, a wide variety of birds grace the woodlands, with the most 
audible among them being the mountain and black-capped chickadees, steller's 
jays, gray jays, robins, ravens and water ouzels. Blue grouse and wild turkeys 
appear fairly tolerant whenever I've encountered them on the road or in the 
woods, and the rare view of a silent and often stationary great horned owl is 
always exhilarating. In the sky above, turkey vultures and red-tailed hawks are 
frequent companions, while a small variety of falcons and the majestic golden 
eagle do appear, now and then.</p> 
<p>This is Colorado wild country. Naturally, signs of sporadic human activity 
are obvious, but in all my trips into this glorious land, I've seldom seen more 
than a car camper or two, and once I've set foot on the primordial trail, I've 
never encountered another soul.</p> 
<p>With that in mind, and still cloudy, though less threatening weather at 
hand, the urge to fish swelled within me that day, as I approached the 
tree-covered parking and pathway beyond.</p> 
<p>In light of the earlier storm, I wasn't surprised to find the place 
deserted upon my arrival. There were no cars or campers, no hikers or other 
fisherman, and at once, as I climbed from the Jeep and quietly prepared 
equipment, a surreal sense of seclusion came over me.</p> 
<p>With hat and waders on, pack in place and rod in hand, I hiked what 
amounted to a glorified game trail for at least 30 minutes, before turning 
toward the clear drone of a tumbling creek ahead. I wanted to work a stretch 
beyond the limits of earlier excursions - to see new territory and fish new 
pools.</p> 
<p>As I walked, the deep woods grew dim with the passage of more clouds, and 
the sheer volcanic cliffs closed in on either side. The air was cool and heavy 
with moisture. The tranquil silence of the great forest broke only with a muted 
chickadee-dee-dee echoing among the trees.</p> 
<p>Once streamside, I strung up the Leonard, checked leader and tippet and 
tied on a small elk-hair caddis with blonde hair and a yellow silk body. I 
hoped it would be a fitting imitation of the small golden stoneflies fluttering 
about over the crystalline riffles and pools where four species of trout 
reside. As I made my first cast, thunder rumbled over nearby peaks and rolled 
through the valley around me.</p> 
<p>In spite of the thunder, occasional blustery winds and intermittent cloud 
cover, the rain held off that afternoon, as I casually fished upstream. In a 
matter of 30 minutes or so, I'd landed two brightly-colored Colorado River 
cutthroats and one plump 12-inch brook trout.</p> 
<p>The canyon, meanwhile, seemed ancient and mysterious, as long sage-green 
tufts of Spanish moss dangled from the lower branches of nearby spruce and fir. 
With the movement of high cumulous, giant shadows crept slowly across lofty 
metamorphic stone faces, and sound variations in the river's flow seemed to 
mimic young voices speaking in barely audible tones. I felt completely alone, 
but not altogether lonely.</p> 
<p>After releasing the brookie, I leaned the rod against a low-hanging branch, 
where its clear varnish and light blonde color sparkled in the recurring summer 
sun. I climbed atop a large midstream boulder, peeled my pack and sat down for 
a snack.</p> 
<p>I nibbled on sharp cheddar and crackers, mixed nuts and a granola bar, as 
the river steadily rushed by me. Its gentle notes might have lured me to sleep, 
were it not for the infrequent thunder that still pealed from distant lightning 
strikes.</p> 
<p>With a liberal swig of water, I quietly wished for something sweet to top 
off my meal, when a small, bright red object suddenly caught my eye in the 
foliage near my rod. Upon closer examination, it was one of many ripe 
raspberries, which led to a minor frenzy that left me feeling full.</p> 
<p>In time, I worked a long stretch of heretofore unfamiliar water and managed 
another half-dozen brilliant multicolored trout. All but one were crimson-sided 
cutthroats of eight to 10 inches, and the other was a slightly larger 
buttery-bellied brown. Each rose heartily to the elk hair, and all were still 
swimming at the end of the day.</p> 
<p>While the weather held and the fishing was fabulous, the discovery of a 
huge inconspicuous waterfall was certainly a highlight. I couldn't physically 
reach it without fording deep pools, but there it was, through the trees, up a 
side canyon a hundred yards from the far side of the river. I guessed its 
height at about 50 feet, but its very presence beckoned closer examination at a 
future date.</p> 
<p>As the sun dipped below the western rim, the forest darkened further and I 
turned for the Jeep. When fishing alone in such wild places, the walk out is 
always a bit spooky, but no particular signs gave pause that evening. There 
were no fresh bear or cat tracks in the mud along the creek, and no eerie 
sounds sparked my sometimes wild imagination. Only the chickadees and robins 
spoke softly to one another, as golden sunlight still reflected off the far 
canyon wall.</p> 
<p>Nevertheless I quickened my pace.</p>

<p><b>County roads</b></p> 
<p>Dear Editor:</p> 
<p>In the past, I have addressed my concerns on how bad the Road and Bridge 
Department of Archuleta County is being run. We are back to hearing from the 
county road supervisor of the long-range plan for road improvement.</p> 
<p>At the rate the county is spending money now, they will never be able to 
maintain the roads throughout the county like in the past. There are serious 
problems confronting county residents. The county has advised us of vacating 
certain county-built bridges, one being our Carracas bridge, which the road 
superintendent said to me he wanted to blow up. You know, Mr. Zumwalt, 80 
percent of our ranch is south of the river. In case of a forest fire south of 
the river, we will come looking for you and the county brass. You and the 
engineers and commissioners better rethink your plans for vacating bridges.</p> 
<p>Why doesn't the county have money for snow removal? Here's why: From April 
through July 2006, the county has spent approximately $400,000 for gravel, 
$84,737 for contract hauling, plus all the county employees and county 
equipment. So we're probably looking at over half a million dollars for gravel 
and haul.</p> 
<p>Now we heard the road boss say at the meeting a couple of weeks ago that he 
needed four more operators. My God, he has a 25 man crew - four in engineering, 
19 in maintenance, seven fleet and five seasonal. From the '50s to 1990, 
Archuleta County had four men in maintenance, 14 operators, and one road boss, 
and every square foot of county road was graveled with little tandem trucks and 
worn-out motor graders. Now look at the fleet of new equipment.</p> 
<p>County commissioners are being misled by their department heads. For 
instance, I was told that gravel pits used by the county in the past were no 
longer meeting road specs. What a joke! Compare roads graveled 20-25 years ago 
with roads being graveled today, half gravel and half dirt. You know road 
binder is in the road, just add gravel. Mr. Zumwalt, I will have you know the 
gravel along the lower San Juan river has made county road specs many times, 
made state highway specs, made specs for Archuleta County airport. Are your 
specs or your engineers' specs tougher than the federal aviation specs?</p> 
<p>Somebody please help straighten out this county mess. Hauling gravel 60 
miles round trip is nonsense. The best materials are on the San Juan from Wolf 
Creek to Navajo.</p> 
<p>Pagosa Lakes, don't fall for improvement districts, or metro, or PID. The 
money is there. I know. In my 12 years as county commissioner, everybody got 
plowed out and not with pickups or SUVs.</p> 
<p>In comparison, La Plata County has a $250,000 road and bridge budget.</p> 
<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p><b>Rodeo woes</b></p> 
<p>Dear Editor:</p> 
<p>On Friday, July 29, my partner and I went with friends to the annual Fiesta 
Days rodeo at the La Plata County Fairgrounds here in Durango. After 
introductory comments, the rodeo got underway with a prayer, asking that no 
humans or animals be harmed during the course of the evening.</p> 
<p>The first event was wild horse riding. Two teams of three big men stood in 
the arena. Two bucking chute gates opened and out sprang two horses, haltered 
with long lead lines attached. We were immediately shocked by the size of the 
horses. They were really not horses at all but rather colts. They looked to be 
no older than two but may possibly have been only yearlings. They were rangy, 
thin and terrified.</p> 
<p>Given the size of the horses, the men were able to simply overpower them. 
The colt closest to us ended up with its neck arced, nose buried in the dirt 
between its forelegs while it braced with all four feet but could do nothing, 
locked in that position by the rope, while a saddle was cinched on it and a big 
man threw himself aboard. The colt, head then released, was hazed across the 
arena to the &quot;finish line.&quot;</p> 
<p>We sat there in disbelief and acute discomfort. This was no measure of 
skill or horsemanship, even in a context of the old ways in which horses were 
broken to saddle. Most people agree that those ways are far inferior to the 
newer training methods which are based on mutual respect and fair play between 
human and horse. It was simply a demonstration of brute dominance and force, 
and it was awful to watch.</p> 
<p>We wondered about the lives of those colts when they are not 
&quot;performing&quot; once or twice a day. We were concerned about how small, 
dull-coated and thin they were. The other rodeo stock looked very well cared 
for. The horses and cattle were in good weight and had shiny coats. It occurred 
to us then that the usefulness of these colts in a &quot;wild&quot; horse act 
would be quite limited. They'd simply give up soon, broken critters, and would 
no longer put on the desired show. Their tenure with this rodeo would be short; 
they were &quot;throwaway&quot; items, probably bought cheaply. There'd be no 
need to invest much care in them. If they're malnourished, they're 1) easier to 
beat down in the event, which obviously can't drag on for an extended time- the 
cowboys must prevail before the audience gets bored, and 2) the rodeo stock 
company saves on feed, worming, vet care, etc., knowing that they won't own 
these colts long anyway.</p> 
<p>What happens to the colts after their short stints as rodeo 
&quot;stars&quot;? Speculations include the following: They've got a bad 
history with people which has created a lot of fear and huge trust issues. 
Hence, they're not suitable post rodeo for anyone but the most experienced sort 
of horse folks. They've been made essentially rescue projects for some good 
souls or projects for folks in institutions perhaps. Most likely I suspect that 
they end their days in crowded pens of other terrified, abused and abandoned 
horses waiting for slaughter at a meat packing plant somewhere. How bitterly 
ironic that introductory prayer was, at least as far as the little 
&quot;wild&quot; horses were concerned. I'll certainly never again attend a 
rodeo at which there is a &quot;wild horse&quot; event like this one without 
speaking directly to rodeo stock people and to local animal abuse agencies 
about the abuse visited upon those animals.</p>

<p><b>Heat is On!</b></p> 
<p>Dear Editor:</p> 
<p>From Aug. 18 through Labor Day (Sept. 4), law enforcement agencies across 
Colorado will be out in increased numbers to find and arrest impaired drivers. 
This effort, called &quot;Over the limit. Under Arrest,&quot; is part of the 
Colorado Department of Transportation's (CDOT) The Heat Is On! campaign and 
refers to the fact that anyone caught driving with a blood alcohol 
concentration (BAC) of .08 or higher will be arrested. Colorado is 
participating in this national crackdown on people who drive under the 
influence of alcohol or drugs.</p> 
<p>The goal of The Heat Is On! campaign is to reduce the numbers of injuries 
and deaths caused by drunk drivers. CDOT and our law enforcement partners seek 
to accomplish this goal by discouraging drunk driving through increased public 
awareness and aggressive DUI enforcement.</p> 
<p>Drunk driving is one of America's deadliest crimes. In fact, during 2004, 
nearly 13,000 people were killed in highway crashes involving an impaired 
driver. And an astounding forty-one percent of the 1,672 motorcycle operators 
who died in single-vehicle crashes in 2004 had BAC levels of .08 or higher.</p> 
<p>In addition to arrest, impaired drivers often face jail time, loss of their 
driver's licenses, higher insurance rates, attorney fees, time away from work 
and other expenses. In Colorado, a driver convicted of DUI could end up 
spending a total of $10,000 or more.</p> 
<p>It is my sincere hope that drivers across Colorado will support The Heat Is 
On! by cooperating with law enforcement at DUI checkpoints and by always using 
designated drivers.</p> 
<p>There are no valid reasons or excuses why anyone should needlessly endanger 
their life and the lives of everyone else on the road. Don't take the chance. 
You will get caught. The Heat Is On! in Colorado, and those who choose to drive 
while over the limit are very likely to find themselves under arrest.</p>

<p><b>'Proposed' levy</b></p> 
<p>Dear Editor:</p> 
<p>In reading over the &quot;proposed&quot; mill levy increase for maintenance 
of, and snow removal from secondary roads, it appears to me that the county 
administrator and the county commissioners have let the public outcry (at least 
the public living on secondary roads) taint their judgment. Why should it be 
incumbent upon the town residents and the residents of the metropolitan 
districts within the county to fund maintenance and snow removal on county 
secondary roads? We, the residents of the Aspen Springs Subdivision, have for 
the past 20 years or so funded our own road maintenance and snow removal; 
currently to the tune of a 10.4 mill levy in addition to the county mill levy.
</p> 
<p>A more equitable proposal would be to ask for a mill levy increase on all 
properties not within the city limits or the boundaries of the special 
districts that already pay an additional mill levy for roads and streets.</p> 
<p>The article further states that Mr. Zumwalt has amazingly decided that the 
county can do those secondary roads this year (see what public outcry can do). 
I suggest that if Mr. Zumwalt, the county administrator and the commissioners 
can find the money for this year then they should be able to find the money for 
next year and future years without an increased mill levy.</p> 
<p>It is true, bureaucrats breed taxation which in turn breeds more taxation. 
The solution: remove the bureaucrats. The commissioners are elected (and well 
paid) to administer the county, why do they need a county administrator? A 
commissioner should be able to oversee the roads, why do they need road, bridge 
and shop supervisors? Why can't the county officials live within the limits 
allowed by the Tabor Amendment, increased spending by the amount of inflation 
and new construction? It appears to me that the bureaucrats are going to 
&quot;grow&quot; the county residents into the poor house. Just as the average 
person must learn to live within their income so should governments.</p> 
<p>Leroy Oldham</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Editor's note: Technically, the ballot issue will not seek to raise the 
mill levy. It will ask voters to approve the &quot;stabilization&quot; of the 
current mill levy, with excess revenues kept and spent rather than 
&quot;refunded.&quot;</p> 
<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p> 
<p><b>Dangerous? </b></p> 
<p>Dear Editor:</p> 
<p>I am wondering if anyone else feels that the 8th Street/160 intersection is 
dangerous? A person cannot see around bushes and other obstacles without 
pulling out far past the stop sign. I have seen many close call accidents at 
this intersection. I have tried calling City Market and local law officials, 
but no concern is felt. Please help fix this situation before someone is 
seriously injured or killed.</p> 
<p>Dan Pickett</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Editor's note: neither City Market nor local law enforcement determines 
signage or signals at the intersection. The Colorado Department of 
Transportation is responsible for controls at a highway intersection.</p>

<p><b>Noted curator to jury 'Form, Figures &amp; Symbols' </b></p> 
<p><b>By Leanne Goebel</b></p> 
<p><b>Special to The PREVIEW</b></p> 
<p>Pagosa's Gerry Riggs will jury &quot;Forms, Figures, Symbols, A Juried 
Exhibition of Contemporary Works,&quot; set for Oct. 21-Nov. 28 at Shy Rabbit, 
a Contemporary Art Space and Gallery. Opening reception for artists is 5-8 p.m. 
Saturday, Oct. 21. </p> 
<p>Riggs served as director/curator of the Gallery of Contemporary Art and as 
and assistant professor at the University of Colorado at Colorado Springs for 
more than 14 years. Riggs also served as the curator of fine art/exhibition 
coordinator at the Colorado Springs Fine Art Center, and director/curator for 
the C.B. Goddard Center for Visual and Performing Arts in Ardmore, Okla.</p> 
<p>Riggs' professional accomplishments include the installation design for 
over 400 exhibitions. He is credited for transforming the gallery at the 
University of Colorado at Colorado Springs into one of the region's most 
important art spaces, and the only one dedicated to contemporary art, whether 
regional of from halfway around the world. He is a member of the American 
Association of Museums, and the AAM Museum Advocacy Team. One of Riggs' 
long-term projects is the Heller Ranch Center for Arts and Humanities on the 
UCCS campus, which when completed, will provide high-quality classroom, 
gallery, and studio space for local and visiting artists. Riggs is an 
accomplished photographer, session drummer and avid skier.</p> 
<p><b>Judging, selection criteria</b> </p> 
<p>&quot;Shy Rabbit has wisely chosen the broad themes of 'Form, Figures and 
Symbols' to maximize the range of contemporary expression that may be 
submitted. Most artists will likely find some affinity with the show's title 
and their existing work. 'Form' allows for abstraction and even work based on 
amorphic or undefined shapes and/or coloration, as well as realistically 
rendered, non-figurative works. 'Figures' implies tangible, but not necessarily 
realistically rendered life based subject matter; figure studies, etc. 
'Symbols' allows for iconographic, even Jungian 'dream based imagery' to be 
submitted; this could include imagery incorporating virtually any known symbol, 
logo, or other highly charged 'representative' cultural or socially based 
interpretations.</p> 
<p>&quot;Given these broad themes, I will select those submissions that I feel 
are the most: compelling, interesting and/or well executed; appropriately 
and/or professionally presented; original in style, and/or contemporary/timely 
in feel or tone. I will also be looking for enough work in two- and 
three-dimensional mediums to allow for an interesting, varied and balanced 
installation, in keeping with the high level and broad range of contemporary 
work that Shy Rabbit has presented in the past.&quot;</p> 
<p>- Gerry Riggs</p> 
<p><b>Call for entries</b></p> 
<p>Shy Rabbit has issued a call for entries for the Form, Figures &amp; 
Symbols exhibit. Digital and slide submissions are due Sept. 19, 5 p.m.

<p><b>Waybacks on the Main Stage at Four Corners Folk Festival </b></p> 
<p><b>By Crista Munro</b></p> 
<p><b>Special to The PREVIEW</b></p> 
<p>You still have just about a week to pick up your advanced-price tickets to 
the 11th annual Four Corners Folk Festival taking place this Labor Day Weekend, 
Sept. 1-3, on Reservoir Hill Park in Pagosa Springs.</p> 
<p>The three-day outdoor festival features nationally touring musicians 
Delbert McClinton; Dar Williams; Eddie From Ohio; RobinElla; Drew Emmitt; Rani 
Arbo and Daisy Mayhem; Old School Freight Train; the Duhks; The Stringdusters; 
the Hot Strings; Anne and Pete Sibley; The Biscuit Burners; Brad Davis, John 
Moore and Company; and Julie Lee with guest Sarah Siskind.</p> 
<p>The Waybacks will return to Pagosa Springs to headline Friday's lineup at 
this year's event. Possessed of dazzling instrumental chops and an absolute 
mastery of acoustic musical styles, The Waybacks have taken North America by 
storm. Whether they're mesmerizing audiences at intimate venues, or creating a 
sensation at major festivals, the band has brought its onstage alchemy to 
enthusiastic fans far and wide.</p> 
<p>Eclectic in both their influences and approach, The Waybacks embrace 
multiple genres and put their unique stamp on the lot, rendering them all with 
characteristic charm, wit and virtuosity. In so doing, they transcend genre 
altogether, conjuring up musical landscapes that defy boundaries but always 
find their center at the crossroads of fun and fascination.</p> 
<p>From newgrass and western swing to jug band and jazz, from folk and fiddle 
music to improvisational excursions that defy categorization, Waybacks music is 
wild, energetic and unpredictable. Their stellar musicianship and innate sense 
of adventure puts them in good company with the few bands at the forefront of 
today's New American acoustic music.</p> 
<p>The success of the group's approach is evident in its broad appeal to 
audiences of all ages, shapes and tastes, whether they sit enraptured, stand 
drop-jawed at breathtaking flights of fancy or just plain get up and dance. 
This is a populist band in the best sense of the term, one whose ardent fan 
base spreads the word like wildfire.</p> 
<p>Based in the San Francisco Bay Area, The Waybacks are Stevie Coyle, James 
Nash, Chuck Hamilton, Joe Kyle Jr. and Warren Hood. Nearly a century of musical 
experience steps onstage with them at every gig, including professional 
associations with a host of musical luminaries ranging from Ramblin' Jack 
Elliot to Lawrence Welk. Go figure. Fleet-fingered and muddy-booted, they can 
play like nobody's business.</p> 
<p>Their first two albums - &quot;Devolver&quot; (2000) and &quot;Burger After 
Church&quot; (2002) - have received airplay on 100-odd radio stations worldwide 
and widespread critical acclaim in the press. Their much-anticipated live CD, 
&quot;Way Live&quot; (2003) captures the band in their element, performing with 
trademark fervor. Those recordings and the band's reputation as performers have 
preceded them, garnering invitations to play mainstage sets at such premiere 
venues as The Fillmore, The Birchmere, The Old Town School of Music, The Great 
American Music Hall, The Freight and Salvage, The Station Inn and The Kennedy 
Center Millennium Stage, among others, as well as at such festivals as 
Merlefest, Grand Targhee, Grey Fox, Kerrville, Strawberry, Winterhawk, Folks 
Festival, Wintergrass, Old Settlers, Walnut Valley and many more.</p> 
<p>All told, The Waybacks is a band far greater than the sum of its parts - 
five intrepid travelers following their muse, looking to chart new territory 
and bringing everyone along for the ride. It's a trip well worth taking. Don't 
miss it! The journey starts on the main stage on Reservoir Hill on Friday, 
Sept. 1 at 7:30 p.m.</p> 
<p>The Four Corners Folk Festival is supported by a grant from the Colorado 
Council on the Arts, a state agency funded by the Colorado General Assembly and 
the National Endowment for the Arts, a federal agency.</p> 
<p>Tickets to this year's Four Corners Folk Festival can be purchased with a 
credit card by calling (970) 731-5582 or online at www.folkwest.com. Tickets

<p><b>First Children's Choir rehearsal Sept. 13 </b></p> 
<p><b>By Sue Anderson</b></p> 
<p><b>Special to The PREVIEW</b></p> 
<p>The Pagosa Springs Children's Choralewill begin rehearsals Sept. 13, on 
Wednesdays from 3:45-5:30 p.m. at Community United Methodist Church.</p> 
<p>The Chorale offers local young singers the opportunity to participate in 
either of its two existing choirs, in addition to attending workshops and music 
camps.</p> 
<p>Bel Canto is the entry-level choir for unchanged voices and is open to all 
boys and girls from ages 7 to 13 who love to sing and perform. It is in this 
choir that music reading skills are taught through the singing of rounds, call 
and response, and partner songs. Bel Canto performs locally throughout the 
holiday season.</p> 
<p>Dolce Cantare was established last season for young women who wish to sing 
more challenging literature, are able to read choral music, and have learned 
harmonization skills either through singing in Bel Canto, at church, school or 
at home. Last spring, this choir of 19 young women, ages 8 to 17, received not 
only a Superior rating, but was awarded the Judge's Choice trophy in 
competition with similar choirs from a six-state area held in Denver. 
Self-disciplined young ladies who are seeking an opportunity to develop their 
vocal skills while being a part of a group that is both challenging and 
rewarding are encouraged to audition for this choir. Acceptance into Cantare is 
based on singing ability and desire, not age.</p> 
<p>This season, the Children's Chorale is focusing on establishing a new Boy's 
Choir, featuring musical selections appropriate for young boys with unchanged 
voices. </p> 
<p>For more information on participation in the Children's Chorale, call 
either 264-9060 or 264-0244 prior to Aug. 30. Leave your name and your child's 
name and age, with a callback number, and you will be contacted.</p>

<p><b>'A Summer Evening of American Folk Music' set for Saturday </b></p> 
<p><b>By Paul Roberts</b></p> 
<p><b>Special to The PREVIEW</b></p> 
<p>A concert entitled &quot;A Summer Evening of American Folk Music&quot; will 
be presented at 7 p.m., Saturday, Aug. 26, at The Pagosa Lakes Clubhouse.</p> 
<p>A celebration of our unique cultural heritage, &quot;A Summer Evening of 
American Folk Music&quot; features folk singers Matthew and Tiffany Brunson, 
Paul and Carla Roberts and Bill Hudson; blues guitarist Steve Rolig; The Clever 
Cloggers; and fiddler Kate Kelley. Presented by Elation Center For The Arts, 
the program is chuck full of vocal harmonies, galloping banjos, soaring fiddles 
and guitars.</p> 
<p>American folk music is a timeless river running through the heart of our 
country. It has its roots in the folk music of many countries, most notably 
England, Scotland, Ireland, and the African continent. Much of our current, 
popular music is based on folk music. This old-time sound has never gone away; 
it's always here, waiting to be discovered and rediscovered.</p> 
<p>In the early 1960s there was a huge folk music revival in the US. Recently, 
the &quot;Oh Brother, Where Art Thou&quot; movie and soundtrack has rekindled 
the flame. And folk music is enjoying a boost from the likes of Bruce 
Springsteen, who is performing concerts of authentic, old-time American folk 
songs.</p> 
<p>&quot;A Summer Evening of American Folk Music&quot; will be performed at 
The Pagosa Lakes Clubhouse, where ECA has presented many community concerts. 
&quot;ECA gives local performers an opportunity to perform for the community - 
and gives the community an opportunity to see talents they might not otherwise 
see,&quot; remarked local cultural arts enthusiast Patsy Lindblad. &quot;I've 
attended all the ECA concerts for the past two years, and enjoyed every 
one,&quot; she said.</p> 
<p>Admission is $8 for adults, $4 for young people, 18 and under.</p> 
<p>Tickets are available at WolfTracks, online at elationarts.org and at the 
door.</p> 
<p>Please bring a dessert to share at intermission if you wish.</p> 
<p>Pagosa Lakes Clubhouse is located at 230 Port Ave. in the Vista subdivision 
of Pagosa Lakes. Take U.S. 160 to Vista Boulevard. Turn north on Vista and left 
on Port.</p> 
<p>&quot;A Summer Evening of American Folk Music&quot; is produced by Elation 
Center for the Arts, a local 501(c) 3 nonprofit arts organization whose mission 
is to preserve, teach and perform traditional music and dance from around the 
world. Through community concerts and educational programs, ECA strives to 
serve the people of Pagosa Springs through artistic excellence.</p>

<p><b>'Mind's Material' exhibit opens Saturday </b></p> 
<p><b>By Denise Coffee</b></p> 
<p><b>Special to The PREVIEW</b></p> 
<p>Shy Rabbit, a contemporary art space and gallery, presents &quot;Mind's 
Material: Sensation, Cognition &amp; Knowledge.&quot; featuring the masterworks 
of Doug Pedersen, Kelsey Hauck and Karl Isberg.</p> 
<p>The exhibition runs from Aug. 26-Oct. 7, with an artist's reception 5-8 
p.m. Saturday, Aug. 26.</p> 
<p>Gallery hours are Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday from 1-4 p.m., and 1-6:30 
p.m. on the second Thursday of the month. Shy Rabbit is located at: 333 
Bastille Drive, Units B-1 and B-4. For more information: log onto 
http://shyrabbit.blogspot.com, call (970) 731-2766, or e-mail 
shyrabbit01@aol.com.</p> 
<p>&quot;Mind's Material&quot; brings the work of Pedersen, Hauck and Isberg 
together for the first time since they met and became friends in 1983.</p> 
<p>The human image is key to each artist's work, which ends any similarities 
that they might otherwise exhibit. Each, however, has produced and shown their 
art for decades. </p> 
<p>Hauck's collage figures often incorporate fine Japanese papers that look as 
if they could be brush strokes of paint - capturing movement, laughter, emotion 
and spirit in tiny pieces of paper all placed together to create an image that 
might be equally beautiful and disturbing.</p> 
<p>Pedersen's paintings are filled with heads: Heads that look like masks or 
ancient sculptures. Heads with mouths agape, or lips pursed. Heads with 
cratered eyes. Red faces on green backgrounds. Gobs of paint and layers of 
color masterfully applied to canvas creating images of heads filled with 
expressions of the here and now.</p> 
<p>Isberg paints abstracted heads and figures, using color and geometry to 
express desire and emotion. Some of his work is vibrant and colorful; other 
paintings are muted and subdued.</p> 
<p>This work evokes passion and stirs emotion. It is art that expresses the 
human condition, with all its frailties and strengths. It is art that beckons a 
closer look, and that speaks in uniquely personal terms to each viewer who 
chances a better understanding.</p> 
<p>Please join us for a casual conversation with artists Pedersen, Hauck and 
Isberg from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. Sunday, Aug. 27.</p> 
<p>All are welcome to attend. Coffee will be provided.</p>

<p><b>Local author publishes book, proceeds go to education fund </b></p> 
<p><b>By Sarah O. Smith</b></p> 
<p><b>Staff Writer </b></p> 
<p>Prompted by her own experiences and the trials of others, local resident 
Helena Gunther recently published a book entitled, &quot;Ladies, Are You Lost? 
Options for Women in Unhealthy Relationships.&quot;</p> 
<p>&quot;Listening to friends of mine talk about their grown daughters who 
have no education and are financially dependent in relationships, in unhealthy 
relationships with one or two children; they just don't feel they have any 
options,&quot; said Gunther.</p> 
<p>The book is available at WolfTracks Bookstore and Coffee, the Methodist 
Thrift Store, and at on-line bookstores such as Amazon and Barnes &amp; Noble. 
Gunther has also published several fiction novels under the pen name Victoria 
Rose. For her first nonfiction book, she not only drew from past experiences 
but also invited local women to share their own inspirational stories.</p> 
<p>&quot;Sometimes, when you're in a relationship like that, where you're 
financially dependent - we lose our sense of identity,&quot; said Gunther. 
&quot;It's not about how to fix a relationship. It's about how to re-find 
yourself and your identity.&quot;</p> 
<p>Gunther said the book has been picked up by the Southwest Safehouse for 
Women in Durango, and she plans on giving seminars there in the future.</p> 
<p>&quot;I don't expect it (the book) to be a big seller, since it's directed 
to women in a particular situation,&quot; said Gunther. &quot;It's designed to 
be compact and simple to read.&quot; </p> 
<p>All profits the book does make will be deposited in a continuing education 
fund for women. Instructions on how to apply are located in the book. Gunther 
said she hopes women will be able to use the money to get educated, but that 
the money is not for amenities like food or rent.</p> 
<p>&quot;It's for education, not maintenance,&quot; she said. </p>

<p><b>High school to hold Back-to-School Dance </b></p> 
<p>Although few high school students may look forward to a return to homework, 
most eagerly anticipate seeing their friends and engaging in the 
extracurricular activities the school provides.</p> 
<p>The high school student council hopes the first-ever Back-to-School Dance 
will accomplish just that. The dance will be held outdoors (weather permitting) 
at Golden Peaks Stadium, 7:30-10:30 p.m. Friday, Aug. 25. In case of rain, the 
dance will be moved indoors to the Commons Area.</p> 
<p>The cost for the dance is $5 for each person. However, if students bring a 
new box of crayons, pencils, colored pencils, or pens, or a package of notebook 
paper or a notebook, they will save $1. The school supplies will be donated to 
Operation Helping Hand and distributed to the schools.</p> 
<p>Only students registered at the high school and their approved 
out-of-school dates will be allowed to attend. Out-of-school date forms were 
available at the high school office and had to be returned to the office for 
the administration's approval no later than Wednesday, Aug. 23.</p> 
<p>No students younger than ninth grade may attend the dance. Students will be 
asked to pay and check their names on the student roster at the main ticket 
gate.</p> 
<p>Members of the student council hope to see all high school students at the 
dance to help kick off the school year on an enjoyable note.</p>

<p><b>Lifelong Learning events in August, September </b></p> 
<p><b>By Biz Greene</b></p> 
<p><b>Special to The PREVIEW</b></p> 
<p>&quot;Great Geezer Artists: A Look at Creative Expressions in Old Age&quot; 
is Judith Reynolds' topic for her forthcoming lecture in Pagosa's new Lifelong 
Learning program, beginning this fall.</p> 
<p>Reynolds, former art history professor, is an author and writer who covers 
performing arts in Durango. From Michelangelo to Matisse, Hokusai to Picasso, 
artists have often created their most profound work after age 75, Reynolds 
points out. Why do lesser talents run dry?</p> 
<p>Her lecture will explore the varieties of late-life artistic production. 
</p> 
<p>The lecture will take place at the Sisson Library, 3 p.m., Saturday, Oct. 
28.</p> 
<p>Lifelong Learning in Pagosa begins this month with John Graves presenting 
the highlights of jazz history at the Sisson Library, 5:30 p.m. Aug. 31. His 
presentation will be followed by a performance in the parking lot at the 
library. </p> 
<p>All presenters in Lifelong Learning in Pagosa are volunteers who offer 
their knowledge and expertise gratis to our community. All programs are free 
and open to the public. Many presenters will come from Fort Lewis College and 
others are permanent residents of Pagosa springs.</p> 
<p>A schedule of offerings will be published weekly in The PREVIEW.</p> 
<p>Persons interested in offering a program should contact Biz Greene at the 
Education Center, located at the corner of 4th and Lewis streets.</p> 
<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p> 
<p><b>Bible study sessions begin in September </b></p> 
<p>Precept Upon Precept, the inductive Bible study pioneered by Kay Arthur, 
will begin Sept. 14 and will continue until Nov. 16. The study this session 
will be on Leviticus, the third book of the Five Books of Moses.</p> 
<p>Do you know how to worship God? How are we to live as the priests and a 
kingdom that God's Word says we are in Jesus Christ? What do sacrifices, 
priesthoods and feasts teach us about how we can be holy and worship God as we 
were designed by Him to do? This study reveals tremendous insights into how we, 
as an unholy people, can approach the Holy of Holies to worship Him properly.
</p> 
<p>Join this study of Leviticus, a frequently overlooked book of the Bible 
because of its focus on temple sacrifices, as it lays the foundation for our 
Christian worship of the God of Israel.</p> 
<p>Jerri Anderson, of Grace Evangelical Free Church, will be the study leader 
and teacher. Classes will be held at Restoration Fellowship's Berean Room and 
will begin at 9 a.m. each meeting day.</p> 
<p>The workbook costs $14.50, and you can register to attend by calling the 
church office at Restoration Fellowship, 731-2937, Ext. 21, by Aug. 30.</p>

<p><b>Will Dunbar - an artist's journey </b></p> 
<p><b>By Kathleen Steventon</b></p> 
<p><b>Special to The PREVIEW</b></p> 
<p>Will Dunbar. </p> 
<p>Why does he do it?</p> 
<p>This is the first in a series of articles that will explore exactly that 
question - with Will and many other locals who create art. We will follow them 
on their personal journeys over a period of time. Perhaps the exploration of 
their growth and dreams will lend us an insight into what it takes to live 
artistically in our materialistic society.</p> 
<p>Have you heard of Will? Maybe you know him, or perhaps you've seen his 
lustrous wood turnings at the downtown Wild Spirit Gallery. His touch on the 
lathe is decisive, yet the wooden sculptures that emerge are delicately 
intuitive. The glowing finishes on his pieces reflect the wood's grain, its 
every nuance, its very life.</p> 
<p>Recently I sat down as a fellow artist on yet another bright, balmy, 
perfect Pagosa day and discussed Will's work and his journey to find a market 
for it. From the exterior, Will is quiet, soft spoken, modest, warm. Ask him a 
few questions about his wood turnings, and he becomes animated, excited, 
passionate.</p> 
<p>He and his wife, Nancy, also an artist, live quietly outside town, their 
house filled with works they've created out of wood, reed, feathers and other 
natural materials. Inside the hand-built dwelling and studio (built over a 
period of many years) Will's woodworking expertise is visible everywhere: on 
the doors, along the baseboards and wood trims, and in the multitude of 
craftsman-style, hand-built furniture pieces evident everywhere you look.</p> 
<p>Will's journey to art began more than 30 years ago in California. Working 
in the interior design industry, fresh out of school with a bachelor of arts 
degree from the University of California at Sacramento, Will began his artistic 
journey creating and restoring furniture. Woodworking seemed second nature to 
him and so, after working an eight-hour day, Will would head to his shop and 
begin the &quot;real&quot; part of his day. Asked what makes someone create, 
after working a full week, Will responded simply, &quot;I'm compelled to 
create. Whether making furniture, building a house, or gardening.&quot;</p> 
<p>Will and Nancy bought property in Pagosa in 1993, &quot;while it was still 
affordable,&quot; and broke ground on their home in 1999. It was here that Will 
expanded his expertise in furniture making to include the exploration of the 
art of wood turning in 2002.</p> 
<p>I asked Will, why the change? His response, &quot;It's been a desire of 
mine, and of many woodworkers, to pursue working with the lathe. The turned 
vessel is created right in front of your eyes. No parts to assemble, no 
diagrams. There are spontaneous results, and an immediate link to the 
wood.&quot;</p> 
<p>Will's work has progressed naturally over the last five years. He has 
experimented with forms and finishes. &quot;Sensual&quot; would be a proper 
adjective to describe the forms Will creates. Also &quot;earthy,&quot; 
&quot;mysterious,&quot; &quot;intuitive.&quot;</p> 
<p>&quot;The form is the favorite part of what I do,&quot; Will said. Closely 
followed by his exploration of wood finishes. Originally, Will used 
applications of friction finishes to create dull sheens on his pieces. This 
technique has evolved into multiple layers of higher gloss looks, as well as 
recent experimentation with turquoise inlays and copper-leaf finishes. Will 
loves the juxtaposition of metal and wood, but acknowledges that he hasn't 
found a market for them yet. &quot;Most of my buyers select natural wood 
pieces, or those with turquoise inlay. The appeal is nature, color, and the 
amazing wood grains. I can't seem to find a place yet for my newer vessels that 
mix wood and metal.&quot;</p> 
<p>Which leads us to a dilemma common to all artists. The work we do comes 
from deep within ourselves. Our inspiration is very personal and private. This 
may not always translate to marketability of the art. Do we simply create to 
sell, and sacrifice our true selves in the process? Or do we create for 
ourselves in the hopes of finding a market?</p> 
<p>Will shook his head when I asked him these questions. &quot;I know exactly 
what you mean. I do struggle with this issue every time I start a new piece. To 
me, art is the integration of person to finished piece. If the artist does not 
make a personal impression on their work, I don't consider it art. Copying 
something exactly the way it appears falls short of art, in my opinion.&quot; 
</p> 
<p>Which led me to my next question. How are you marketing yourself and your 
beautiful work? Will is now represented at La Mesa Gallery in Santa Fe, Wild 
Spirit Gallery in Pagosa, Local Color Gallery in Chama, and Handcrafted 
Interiors in Pagosa.</p> 
<p>Will shared a good story about his introduction to the Santa Fe gallery.</p>
<p>His good friend, Sandy Applegate, an artist herself, was scouting gallery 
possibilities in Santa Fe last fall of 2005. While in the La Mesa Gallery, she 
struck up a conversation with the gallery's owner. Sandy recognized that Will's 
wood turnings would be an asset to the gallery. After pointing this out to the 
owner, whose interest was piqued, Will and La Mesa began an e-mail interchange 
over a period of several months. Photo images of Will's work passed back and 
forth between Pagosa and Santa Fe, resulting in a contract agreement between 
the two this past spring 2006. Will has already sold one piece through the 
gallery in Santa Fe, and many more through the local Wild Spirit Gallery. Jean 
Magnelli, the director of Wild Spirit, has sold Will's work to appreciative art 
lovers from Norway and Belgium, and as well as from all over the United States.
</p> 
<p>I asked Will where he sees his art career going. Wistfully he replied that 
he &quot;hopes to become independent, to make a living beyond retirement with 
his work.&quot;</p> 
<p>Does he think he can get there from here? He does, but the road to 
financial success, for artistic endeavors such as Will's stunning wood turned 
vessels, is blurry. Another type of challenge for him. But, 
&quot;challenge&quot; is another word for &quot;opportunity,&quot; is it not?
</p> 
<p>Hearing Will Dunbar discuss his life journey and his work, it seems evident 
that the many challenges he faces will be met. Perhaps when we revisit Will in 
a few years we'll discover how he has overcome some of these challenges. Who 
knows what his work will have become by then?</p>

<p><b>College sorority alumnae sought</b></p> 
<p><b>By Carole Howard</b></p> 
<p><b>Special to The PREVIEW</b></p> 
<p>Women who were members of a Panhellenic sorority during their college days 
are asked to save the date of Saturday, September 30 for the first-ever 
luncheon of sorority alumnae to take place in Pagosa Springs.</p> 
<p>The event is being organized by members of the San Juan Pi Beta Phi alumnae 
group.</p> 
<p>Prepaid reservations will be required several days before the luncheon, 
which will take place at JJ's Upstream restaurant. Cost will be $20 per person, 
including a pre-arranged entr&eacute;e, dessert, non-alcoholic drink, tax and 
tip.</p> 
<p>&quot;Details still are being firmed up,&quot; said Lisa Scott, president 
of the local Pi Phis. &quot;We will get more information out in mid-September. 
Right now we just want to alert local sorority women to our plans so they can 
put the event on their calendars.&quot;</p> 
<p>As the date gets closer, the organizers will decide if the event will be 
held outside on the riverfront patio or inside in the large patio room 
overlooking the river. &quot;We also hope the weather cooperates so that we can 
stage a group photo outside on the riverfront,&quot; Scott said.</p> 
<p>There are 26 Panhellenic sororities whose alumnae are invited to this 
event: Alpha Chi Omega, Alpha Delta Pi, Alpha Epsilon Phi, Alpha Gamma Delta, 
Alpha Phi, Alpha Omicron Pi, Alpha Sigma Alpha, Alpha Sigma Tau, Alpha Xi 
Delta, Chi Omega, Delta Delta Delta, Delta Gamma, Delta Phi Epsilon, Delta 
Zeta, Gamma Phi Beta, Kappa Alpha Theta, Kappa Delta, Kappa Kappa Gamma, Pi 
Beta Phi, Phi Mu, Phi Sigma Sigma, Sigma Delta Tau, Sigma Kappa, Sigma Sigma 
Sigma, Theta Phi Alpha and Zeta Tau Alpha.</p> 
<p>The San Juan alumnae group of Pi Beta Phi was formed in Pagosa Springs in 
March 2000. Chi Omega also has a local alumnae club, based in Durango. 
&quot;Other than that, we only know of a few individual sorority alumnae,&quot; 
Scott said. &quot;We hope this luncheon will help identify others, and give us 
all an opportunity to get together to renew the bonds of Greek life.&quot;</p>

<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p> <b>Local Chatter</b> 
<p></p> 
<p><b>An interesting read from a reporter </b></p> 
<p><b>By Kate Terry</b></p> 
<p>Few people have witnessed more scenes of chaos and conflict around the 
world than Anderson Cooper whose ground-breaking work on CNN has changed the 
way many people watch the news.</p> 
<p>Cooper is the son of Gloria Vanderbilt and grew up on Manhattan's East 
Side. Early in his life, he lost his father to a heart attack and a brother to 
suicide. These tragedies in Anderson's life had an unusual impact on his career.
</p> 
<p>As a reporter, he was driven to cover the suffering he found all over the 
world and it became impossible to separate his personal pain and loss from that 
he found around him. He thought that by going to the war-torn countries, he 
could escape his past agonies and his family's tragic history and somehow 
lessen his personal pain.</p> 
<p>From Sarajevo to Somalia, his reflections on Iraq, Rwanda and finally 
Katrina and New Orleans are vivid, and one feels how deeply these events 
affected him and how difficult it was to separate his work from his life.</p> 
<p>The book is &quot;Anderson Cooper - Dispatches From the Edge: A Memoir of 
War, Disasters, and Survival.&quot; Sisson Library does not have this book. I 
hope someone will donate a copy.</p> 
<p><b>Around town</b></p> 
<p>A friend told me this story last week. </p> 
<p>She saw her neighbor's cat running across the yard chased by a doe and its 
fawn. They chased the cat under a flatbed storing a boat. The flatbed was 
located by the side of her house. The doe and the fawn looked under the flatbed 
but they couldn't reach the cat. They proceeded to climb on the flatbed and 
wait for the cat to come out. The cat would not accommodate them so they 
finally tired of the sport and scampered off on their adventures. I can't find 
anyone else who as seen deer chasing a cat. Have you?</p>

<p>He puts on a dress shirt (made in Taiwan), his designer jeans (made in

<p><b>Colorfest dance features the High Rollers </b></p> 
<p><b>By Becky Herman</b></p> 
<p><b>PREVIEW Columnist</b></p> 
<p>It's time to start thinking about The Chamber's annual Colorfest weekend, 
Sept. 15-17, when we celebrate what some of us think is the most beautiful time 
of year in Pagosa Country.</p> 
<p>Friday, there will be a Beer, Brats, and Balloons picnic in the park the 
early part of the evening. The beer comes from SKA brewing, and the picnic 
itself is hosted by the Knights of Columbus. Then, everyone is invited to spend 
the rest of the evening at the community center where the High Rollers from 
Durango will provide music for listening and dancing. As usual, there will be 
free snacks and a cash bar. Watch here for details about ticket information.</p>
<p><b>Humane Society auction</b></p> 
<p>Tomorrow, it's here - the 12th annual Humane Society Auction for the 
Animals, at 5:30 p.m. Not only can you bid on all sorts of wonderful stuff and 
have a glass of wine with your gourmet treats, but you are supporting the

center-sponsored program, is free to the public of all ages. Everyone is 
welcome to attend.</p> 
<p>Thanks to Diana Baird for leading this group. Call the center for

<p><b>Self-Help for Health</b></p> 
<p>According to Medora Bass, the teacher of this self-help group, the first 
class as a group came up with the characteristics of a person who is physically 
healthy. Each person formulated a goal he/she wanted to achieve during the 
course of the class.</p> 
<p>Last week, at the second class, the group looked at some possible reactions 
and responses to having a health challenge and came up with reactions that 
don't work. Among these were: resignation, helplessness, depression, denial, 
resentment, anger, fear, anxiety and resistance. Responses that the group 
thought would work were: acceptance, dealing with the situation with sense of 
humor, loving oneself through the challenge, and rising up to meet the 
challenge and taking action. One person acted out the homework assignment. She 
acted with remarkable ease and proficiency the parts of her symptom and her 
healing force and then the healing force interacting with and healing the 
symptom.</p> 
<p>Each person answered the question concerning what is the opportunity to 
learn and grow personally in the situation of having a health challenge. Since 
illness is often a wake-up call about something that is out of balance in one's 
life, participants looked at what they want to do but currently are not doing, 
such as starting a new career or speaking with integrity. They also looked at 
what they are doing but do not want to be doing, such as spending more time 
working than they want, etc.</p> 
<p>If you are interested in the details of how this program works, call the 
center at 264-4152 or stop by for a handout which will explain the process.</p> 
<p>These classes are not meant to diagnose or treat any illness. The goal of 
this program is to help participants be aware of factors that may affect their 
health and help them better realize their goals.</p>

<p><b>Managing diabetes</b></p> 
<p>According to the American Diabetes Association, there are 20.8 million 
children and adults in the United States who have diabetes; that's 7 percent of 
the population. While an estimated 14.6 million have been diagnosed with the 
disease, 6.2 million (nearly one third) are unaware that they have the disease.
</p> 
<p>Diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce or properly use 
insulin, a hormone that is needed to convert sugar, starches and other food 
into the energy needed for daily life. The cause of diabetes continues to be a 
mystery, although both genetics and environmental factors play roles.</p> 
<p>The community center's Managing Diabetes group is our small, but we hope 
not insignificant, way to help those in our community who have or are at risk 
for this disease. Please let us know if there are specific ways in which this 
program could help you. The next meeting at 5:30 p.m. Aug. 31.</p>

<p>Stop by the center if you would like copies of the handouts from the first

<p><b>'Fight Bac' with simple cleaning practices </b></p> 
<p><b>By Jeni Wiskofske</b></p> 
<p><b>SUN Columnist</b></p> 
<p>The Fight Bac campaign for food safety promotes four important points: 
clean, cook, shill and separate.</p> 
<p>All four of these factors are important, but cleanliness is crucial. Many 
health experts agree that the most important thing you can do to prevent 
illness is to wash your hands. Clean hands are vital to health and food safety. 
Wash your hands with soap and warm water for 20 seconds under running water. 
Then, be sure to dry your hands thoroughly with a clean paper or cloth towel.
</p> 
<p>When you're preparing foods, a clean kitchen is also essential for food 
safety. Clean utensils and countertops with hot soapy water before and after 
preparing food. Kitchen sponges, dishrags and towels can harbor bacteria. 
Depending on how much you use them, wash dishrags and towels frequently in the 
washing machine and dry them completely. You can put wet kitchen sponges in the 
microwave for one minute to sanitize them and to start the drying process. You 
can also put sponges in the dishwasher and run them through a cycle with your 
dishes. Be sure to replace your kitchen sponge frequently so that it's always 
fresh.</p> 
<p>By keeping your hands and your kitchen clean, you'll be taking an important 
step in preventing food borne illness for you and your family.</p> 
<p><b>Pain management tips</b></p> 
<p>From Nathan Trout.</p> 
<p>Heat versus cold.</p> 
<p>Heat is used to alleviate pain when you have mild to moderate soreness 
after an activity. A heating pad set on medium heat and placed on the area of 
soreness for 15 minutes should assist in decreasing level of soreness. Hot tubs 
or hot springs are also useful if you have no medical concerns of full body 
immersion in warm water; also limit to time in the water. Heat pack may be used 
3 times per day until soreness gone.</p> 
<p>Cold is more useful when you can say &quot;this hurts&quot; or have a high 
degree of soreness. Use an ice pack wrapped in a pillowcase with 3 layers of 
pillowcase cloth between your skin and the pack for 10-15 minutes. May be used 
three times per day until you have reduce the pain or high soreness, then you 
may switch to heat or exercise.</p> 
<p>Easy daily stretches</p> 
<p>1. Straight knee calf stretch: lean against a wall with your hands; put one 
foot behind you and point the toes of that foot straight ahead towards wall; 
keeping heel down, lean into the wall until a gentle stretch is felt in the 
upper calf muscle. Hold 30 seconds.</p> 
<p>2. Bent knee calf stretch: lean against the wall with your hands; put one 
foot behind you but not as far as in No. 1 above and point the toes straight 
ahead towards wall again; keeping heel down, lean into the wall until a gentle 
stretch is felt in the lower calf muscle. Hold 30 seconds.</p> 
<p>3. Hamstring stretch: hold onto something sturdy with your hand; put one 
heel onto a low step (4 to 9 inches high); keep knee straight; bend forward 
from your hips, not your low back (in other words, keep your back straight), 
until a gentle stretch is felt on the back side of your thigh. Hold 30 seconds.
</p> 
<p>4. Quad stretch: hold onto something sturdy with one hand; standing on one 
leg, bring the other foot up behind you and grasp the top of that foot with 
your hand on the same side of your body; pull foot up towards your buttocks 
until a gentle stretch is felt in the front of your thigh. Hold 30 seconds. An 
alternative is to place the top of your foot onto the seat of a chair if the 
front of the thigh is very tight or the knee does not bend well.</p> 
<p><b>Aikido classes</b></p> 
<p>The martial way of harmony.</p> 
<p>Aikido is a relatively modern martial art, although its roots go back 
nearly 1,000 years to secret techniques of samurai warriors. Beginning in 
September, The Den will be offering Aikido classes every Wednesday at 1 p.m. 
Please sign up with The Den office by Friday, Aug. 25, if you would like to 
participate in the September classes.</p> 
<p>The founder, Morehei Ueshiba or O-Sensei, studied traditional martial arts 
as a young man. Many say he was the greatest martial artist who ever lived. A 
deeply spiritual man, he became convinced that the true purpose of the martial 
way was self-perfection and the loving protection of all beings. He named his 
art &quot;Aikido,&quot; which translates to &quot;The Way of Harmony with the 
Universe.&quot;</p> 
<p>Aikido students learn hand techniques for armed and unarmed attackers, and 
train with the wooden sword and short staff. Most importantly, they learn to 
blend with and redirect and attacker's energy, controlling the attacker. There 
is no competition in Aikido because of O-Sensei's beliefs and because the 
techniques are too powerful. With the goal of bettering oneself rather than 
trying to be better than an opponent, students of all ages and skills can 
safely practice and learn together.</p> 
<p>Aikido is beneficial for health, coordination, stress relief and character. 
Aikido is practiced by people of all physical abilities from children well into 
the senior years. To join the Aikido classes at The Den or for more 
information, call Jeni at 264-2167.</p>

<p></p> 
<p><b>New information on Agent Orange exposure </b></p> 
<p><b>By Andy Fautheree</b></p> 
<p>I recently wrote in this column about certain &quot;presumptive&quot; 
medical conditions that are considered service connected disabilities.</p> 
<p>Most commonly, many veterans are aware of exposure to the herbicide Agent 
Orange in Vietnam and the side affects of that exposure such as Diabetes Type 
II, prostate cancer and a number of other medical conditions.</p> 
<p>The assumption by the VA has been, if you were in country in Vietnam during 
the Vietnam War and you have certain medical problems such as those above and 
others, it is presumed that this medical condition is due to your exposure to 
Agent Orange. Essentially, you do not have to prove your case, the VA 
acknowledges the presumptive and awards the service connected disability.</p> 
<p>However, until recently, the VA did not usually consider that a veteran was 
exposed to Agent Orange unless the claimant was on the ground in Vietnam. The 
claimant may have had to prove the exposure.</p> 
<p>New information</p> 
<p>I recently received the following information in a VA Court of Appeals case 
that broadened the possible exposure to Agent Orange to include those who 
served in Vietnam in the Navy off the coast of Vietnam or in nearby countries 
of Thailand, Laos and Cambodia.</p> 
<p>&quot;The Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims recently held that VA 
regulations defining who had service in Vietnam for the purpose of establishing 
a presumption to exposure to herbicides (e.g. Agent Orange) were too 
restrictive. Consequently, those who served in Thailand, Laos and Cambodia or 
on Navy ships off the coast of Vietnam may be eligible for service connection 
of certain cancers, including lung and prostate cancer, as well as Type 2 
Diabetes.</p> 
<p>&quot;Veterans who were previously denied service connection for a 
presumptive disability should reopen their claim with the VA. Those who have a 
presumptive disability should apply immediately for service connection. Those 
who receive service connection for any disability are entitled to free 
treatment for that condition at any VA medical facility and may be entitled to 
a monthly payment from the VA.&quot;</p> 
<p>Share-A-Ride</p> 
<p>Don't forget to call or stop by my office with your VA health care 
appointments for the Share-A-Ride program. Help a fellow veteran who may be 
going in the same direction to the same VA facility. Give me a call if you can 
provide transportation or need transportation. I will keep a calendar of who is 
going where to coordinate this important program.</p>

<p><b>Free jazz event at library </b></p> 
<p><b>By Carole Howard</b></p> 
<p><b>SUN Columnist, and the library staff</b></p> 
<p>You are invited to a very special evening at the library on Thursday, Aug. 
31, when John Graves will entertain at a free jazz event.</p> 
<p>He will lead a discussion of the development of jazz from the 1920s through 
the Big Band era of the '40s in the library's Turner Reading Room from 5:30 to 
6:30 p.m. That lecture will be followed by a jazz concert in the parking lot 
from 7 to 8. This musical treat is free and open to the public. Please bring 
chairs or blankets to sit on, and remember that no alcohol is permitted on 
library property.</p> 
<p>This event is the first in a new series at the library called Lifelong 
Learning, organized locally by library volunteer Biz Greene.</p> 
<p>Future free events in the fall will include lectures by Fort Lewis faculty 
on topics such as &quot;Preserving Western History,&quot; &quot;Women to the 
Rescue: Creating Mesa Verde National Park,&quot; &quot;Engineers without 
Borders&quot; and &quot;The Venus Figurine Controversy.&quot; Later, there also 
will be presentations by talented local people as well.</p> 
<p><b>New look at the library</b></p> 
<p>As you've visited the library this summer, you may have noticed several 
changes.</p> 
<p>The Hershey Collection of Southwest books has been moved to a more visible 
place, and Terry Hershey's furniture in front of the shelves gives you the 
feeling you are in their living room or den as you peruse this remarkable 
collection.</p> 
<p>Meagan's Place, the special section for teens and young adults, also has 
been opened up. Previously tall shelves of books at its entrance obscured the 
warm and cozy look of this area.</p> 
<p>Also, the new books section to the left of the front door as you enter the 
library is now much more open and inviting.</p> 
<p>All these changes were made by the staff to make the library look more 
friendly and welcoming. They are excellent examples of what creative people can 
do without spending a penny!</p> 
<p><b>Thanks to donors</b></p> 
<p>Many thanks for books and other materials from William Backus, Charlene 
Baumgardner, Kerry Dermody, Natalie Gabel, Zoeie Lloyd, Kathy McIver, Pam 
Monteffante, Richard Muller, Gary Timmerman, Barbara Ward, Bill Witzel and 
Carol Young. </p> 
<p><b>Books for teens and young adults </b></p> 
<p>Several new books have been added to the Teens and Young Adults section of 
the library that we think will interest you.</p> 
<p>One, called &quot;Esperanza Rising&quot; by Pam Munoz Ryan, has won 
multiple awards for outstanding young adult fiction. It tells the inspiring 
story of a young woman whose family was forced to leave their ranch in Mexico 
and flee to California to face - and ultimately thrive in - a much more 
difficult life. Another is a three-part series of books by J. B. Stephens 
called &quot;The Big Empty&quot; about the adventures of six teens after a 
virus wipes out nearly half the world.</p> 
<p><b>New books on CD</b></p> 
<p>Books on CD are becoming more popular with our patrons every day, and we 
have new ones coming in regularly from bestselling authors. They include 
&quot;Miracle&quot; by Danielle Steel, &quot;Sea Swept&quot; by Nora Roberts, 
&quot;Manhunt&quot; by Janet Evanovich, and &quot;Dark Harbor&quot; by Stuart 
Woods. On a more serious level, and still on CD, is &quot;American Theocracy: 
The Peril and Politics of Radical Religion, Oil and Borrowed Money in the 21st 
Century&quot; by Kevin Phillips. </p> 
<p><b>New non-fiction books</b></p> 
<p>&quot;Supreme Command&quot; by Eliot A. Cohen is winning prizes and rave 
reviews for its coverage of soldiers, statesmen and leadership in wartime. 
Using the experiences of Abraham Lincoln, Georges Clemenceau, Winston Churchill 
and David Ben-Gurion to build his case, the author appeals not only to people 
interested in military and political affairs and also to anyone interested in 
leadership.</p> 
<p>&quot;Oh What A Slaughter&quot; by Larry McMurty is a searing history of 
the bloody massacres that marked - and marred - the settling of the American 
West in the 19th century, and still provoke immense controversy today.</p> 
<p>&quot;Grand Canyon: Solving the Earth's Grandest Puzzle&quot; by James 
Lawrence Powell reads like a detective novel as it traces the work of 
generations of geologists trying to understand this majestic landscape.</p> 
<p>&quot;Potty Training Your Baby&quot; by Katie Warren claims its advice will 
allow you to begin training before your child's first birthday and be fully 
completed by the second year.</p>

<p><b>History on the half shell </b></p> 
<p><b>By Fran Jenkins</b></p> 
<p><b>Special to The PREVIEW</b></p> 
<p>Mark Kurlansky begins his narrative, &quot;The Big Oyster: History on the 
Half Shell,&quot; in 1609 with Henry Hudson, a British explorer employed by 
Holland to find a water route through North America to China.</p> 
<p>While exploring the eastern seaboard of North America, Hudson and his crew 
entered what is known now as New York and &quot;almost as if falling through a 
keyhole, found themselves in another world.&quot; The land around this great 
confluence of rivers was abundant was with wildlife and the rivers were teeming 
with marine life.</p> 
<p>Landing on Staten Island, the shore party found ripe plums and grapevines. 
The sailors traded their tools with the Lenape natives for hemp, beans, and a 
local delicacy - oysters.</p> 
<p>Thus begins the author's masterful writing, taking you into the depths of 
history with his exhaustive research of New York and the oyster. When the early 
explorers sailed through the rivers and waterways, there were 350 square miles 
of oyster beds, estimated to be over half of the world's supply in the 1600s. 
Oysters were reported to be more than a foot in length.</p> 
<p>Until the early 1900s the oyster played the leading role in the city of New 
York's economy, gastronomy and ecology. They appealed to the rich and, because 
they were cheap, they were a mainstay in the poor man's diet.</p> 
<p>The oyster fills another important role beyond filling stomachs. This 
bivalve has an incredible capacity for filtering and cleaning water. A single 
oyster filters between 20 and 50 gallons of seawater through its gills in a 
single day. All the water in New York harbor was filtered in a matter of days 
by the original oyster population. So, while supporting the local economy, 
worldwide demand for oysters also eventually contributed to the burgeoning 
society and its resultant pollution. The sewage, garbage, and factory toxins 
dumped into the rivers destroyed the fishing industry and almost destroyed the 
rivers and surrounding sea. In the 20th century, man began to take positive 
action against this pollution and today there is hope that someday - probably 
not in the near future, but someday - oysters may again thrive in New York 
harbor.</p> 
<p>The more than two dozen historical oyster recipes in the book include the 
stories of the famous restaurants Delmonico's, Waldorf-Astoria and the Astor 
House, and the way oysters appeared on their menus. Personalities, such as 
Diamond Jim Brady, Lillian Russell and J. Pierpont Morgan are described as is 
their consumption of enormous quantities of oysters.</p> 
<p>In the words of Kurlansky &quot;The history of New York oysters is a 
history of New York itself - its wealth, its strength, its excitement, its 
greed, its thoughtlessness, its destructiveness, its blindness and, as any New 
Yorker will tell you, its filth.&quot;</p> 
<p>This history of the trashing of New York, the killing of its great estuary, 
is a sobering yet fascinating read, published by Ballantine Books of New York 
in 2006.</p>

<p></p> 
<p><b>Terrine and pinot, the breakfast of champions</b></p> 
<p><b>By James Robinson</b></p> 
<p><b>Staff Writer</b></p> 
<p>While there are many things I appreciate about Pagosa Springs and rural 
Colorado, big cities, such as Albuquerque, have a certain allure and their 
advantages - like friends who own restaurants. And by southwestern Colorado 
standards, Albuquerque is a teeming megalopolis, but in the grand scheme of 
things, it is a big small town, not a culinary Mecca, however there is good 
dining to be had - if you know where to look. And Friday morning had me looking 
hard.</p> 
<p>I left Pagosa Springs Thursday night about 8 p.m., and braced myself for 
the four-hour drive with a thermos of stout coffee. By quarter after midnight I 
was back in my old digs, and by half past, I had peeled off my clothes and 
toppled into bed. Visions of road kill elk and darting jackrabbits on the 
Jicarilla Apache Reservation bounced around inside my skull until the wee hours 
of the morning. By 6 a.m., I was up again, and driving into the city, sans 
coffee, for an appointment at the Toyota dealer - time for a new timing belt.
</p> 
<p>As I sat on the leather couch in the service department's waiting area, I 
wallowed in self-pity. I lacked coffee, hadn't shaved, showered or eaten a 
decent meal, aside from a bag of barbecue Corn Nuts, for nearly 36 hours, and 
felt like crap. I passed out on the couch with my cap pulled low over my eyes 
and a fresh copy of The Pagosa Springs SUN splayed wide over my chest.</p> 
<p>I awoke nearly three hours later to someone nudging my leg with their foot.
</p> 
<p>&quot;James,&quot; the voice whispered.</p> 
<p>&quot;James, wake up.&quot;</p> 
<p>It was my friend M.P.</p> 
<p>She stood over me, peering down like a scientist examining some rare form 
of bacteria through a microscope, appearing both pleased, but somewhat puzzled 
with their discovery.</p> 
<p>&quot;What are you doing?&quot; she asked.</p> 
<p>&quot;Sleeping, until you woke me up. Where were you? You were supposed to 
be here hours ago.&quot;</p> 
<p>She had promised to take me to breakfast and to be my chauffeur until my 
truck was finished.</p> 
<p>&quot;I went to the wrong dealership, the one on the north end of town. 
I've spent most of the morning looking for you.&quot;</p> 
<p>As a peace offering, she handed me a thick, homemade slice of tarte aux 
pommes and a cup of piping hot Argentine espresso from a stash I'd cached with 
her in Albuquerque for just such emergencies. My morning began to improve.</p> 
<p>After wolfing down the tarte, we walked to her car and pondered breakfast. 
She hadn't eaten at all, and for me, the tarte was just an appetizer and I was 
ready for the main event. As is typical when we are together in the Duke City, 
we began to argue about where to eat. The city is full of mediocre, and truly 
horrible restaurants, and it's not that we argue about where to go, its that we 
agree the choices are incredibly limited, and in the end, were not really 
fighting each other, were just complaining about the dearth of fine places to 
eat.</p> 
<p>As we grumbled and complained, the car, functioning as though on autopilot, 
meandered toward Christiene's restaurant, and came to a stop in the parking 
lot. We were like a couple of homing pigeons, and even in the heat of battle, 
our unconscious minds had propelled us to one of the city's few temples of 
guaranteed, gastronomic euphoria. The problem was, Christiene, by all 
appearances, was closed. However, it pays to have friends who own restaurants, 
and when one is well connected, a &quot;Closed&quot; sign is a mere formality 
and we were cordially ushered in. And granted, although the chefs, Patric and 
Andr&eacute;, two Frenchmen schooled in the classic, old-school European 
culinary arts, weren't quite ready to serve, coffee was on, bread was in the 
oven and service was just minutes away. We could wait.</p> 
<p>In a matter of minutes, one of the servers took us to a table, and we sat 
down to peruse the menu. We barely had them open when Andr&eacute; darted out 
from the kitchen, and with a look of childish glee, announced in French that 
Patric had made a terrine de canard that was not to be missed. This is not to 
say I am fluent in the language, but I know terrine de canard when I hear it, 
and by Andr&eacute;'s body language, Patric had gone the extra mile. Deal done, 
and I planned a breakfast that could not have been had anywhere but in a big 
city.</p> 
<p>First, I would start with a glass of Muscadet, S&egrave;vre-et-Maine, mis 
en bouteille sur lie, of course, and I didn't even bother to look at the 
vintner nor vintage. Muscadet is a wine geek's mouthwash and I mean that in the 
best sense of the word. What better way to start the day than with a crisp, 
bright, slightly effervescent white wine from near the city of Nantes where the 
Loire River spills into the Atlantic? I dreamed of fresh flounder, mussels, or 
sole, but lacking those options, I paired the Muscadet with snow crab cakes and 
a mesclun salad with lemon juice, a touch of sea salt and a simple vinaigrette 
on the side. For the main, terrine de canard, the breakfast of champions.</p> 
<p>When the crab cakes arrived, we plowed through them with ravenous fervor, 
gobbled the salad, and devoured hunks of fresh, hot bread slathered with 
butter. After making quick work of the crab cakes, our server returned after a 
short respite with a simple, but perfectly presented and aromatic terrine de 
canard. We eyed the quarter inch layer of gelatin surrounding the beautifully 
marbled terrine. We examined and commented on the texture. It appeared perfect, 
somewhere between the velvety smoothness of a mousse, and somewhat less coarse 
than a more rustic, p&acirc;t&eacute; de campagne. We dove in.</p> 
<p>Terrines are cooked in a brick-shaped loaf pan of the same name, and can be 
served hot, cold, or at room temperature. The main ingredient determines the 
name of the terrine, and the dish can be made with vegetables, seafood, or more 
exotic proteins such as wild boar and rabbit. In this case, duck was the 
principal ingredient, hence, terrine de canard, and Patric chose to serve his 
warm, but not hot. And although some terrines are prepared for serving directly 
on the plate, like the primary protein in any dinner entr&eacute;e, others are 
intended for consumption on slices of bread like a pat&eacute;. Patric's 
terrine de canard fell into the latter category, and out came more slices of 
bread. We ordered a second serving.</p> 
<p>Sometime during our gluttonous fervor, I lost track of my wine glass, and 
halfway through the first portion I realized I was in dire need of something 
red to cut through the layers of rich, smoky duck liver - pinot noir would be 
just the thing.</p> 
<p>My addiction to pinot noir began years ago, and since that time, she has 
been a demanding and cruel mistress. There are times when her velvety texture 
and sumptuous earthiness have driven me to heights of euphoria approaching 
religious exaltation, and we have spent those nights, transfixed and 
intertwined like lovers. And then there are the bad nights, the nights she 
slaps you around, empties your wallet, and leaves you cold, bewildered and 
wanting on the sidewalk. And those are the nights you swear you'll never go 
back, but in the end you buckle, you give in, and you crave more. I have driven 
hundreds of miles on a hunch in pursuit of the juice from this noble grape of 
Bourgogne, and I have spent far more money than a man of my means ought to 
spend for something as inconsequential as a bottle of wine. But no matter the 
cost, no matter the circumstance, each time, the trick is different, and the 
obsession grows and the craving for pinot noir consumes like a cancer.</p> 
<p>I was on dangerous, shaky ground, but luckily, the options by the glass 
were limited to just one, and I took what was being poured - some brand of 
low-end juice out of California - and hoped for the best. Perhaps it was the 
company, perhaps it was the terrine, perhaps it was the pinot, but whatever the 
case, the California juice went down fine, and I vowed to attempt to replicate 
the experience when I returned to Pagosa Springs.</p> 
<p>I knew I would be hard pressed to find a stellar terrine de canard, so I 
opted for a store-bought duck p&acirc;t&eacute; that would serve as an 
acceptable surrogate. On the other hand, I knew my options for average, 
domestic pinot would be numerous, but I hoped I could find at least one 
reliable option that wouldn't break the bank when the craving for pinot noir 
became unbearable.</p> 
<p>The wines</p> 
<p>Hayman &amp; Hill Pinot Noir Santa Lucia Highlands 2005 Reserve Selection: 
In the nose, the Hayman &amp; Hill greets the taster with vanilla, toasted oak, 
root beer and unusual amounts of heat for a wine of just 13.5 percent alcohol. 
In the glass and around the edges, the wine is thin and wispy with a bright 
cranberry colored core. Although the wine demonstrates a color shift from core 
to edge, which is not altogether unusual, the color is uneven, wanders, and the 
wine looks unusually weary for its youth - it lacks uniformity and clarity. By 
the color, the wine appears lost and this observation holds true on the palate. 
In the mouth, the Hayman &amp; Hill is a clumsy m&eacute;lange of flavors, with 
blackberries, subtle earth notes and overriding hints of bubble gum. Although 
the flavors are odd, the wine has good acidity and if you're into blackberry 
bubble gum, is well balanced. It may show better with food.</p> 
<p>Estancia Pinot Noir Pinnacles Ranches Monterey 2005: By appearances, the 
Estancia is dense and compact with an electric, razor sharp clarity from core 
to edge. The color is dynamic, even and lively, and foreshadows a wine packed 
with red fruits, including raspberries and cranberries with undertones of black 
cherries and hints of pepper. The nose is well defined and leads the taster to 
a slightly more astringent and tightly woven structure and mouthfeel. With 
Estancia's fruit-driven style, it is clear this is not Burgundy. Nevertheless, 
the Estancia makes for an enjoyable quaff and for the money, boasts a 
tremendous finish. At two dollars more than the Hayman &amp; Hill, make the 
investment and enjoy it alone, or, pair it with grilled rack of lamb, new 
potatoes seasoned with rosemary and tomatoes Proven&ccedil;al.</p> 
<p>And if anyone is making terrine de canard, give me a call, I'll bring the 
wine.</p>

<p></p> 
<p><b>Harl and Karl, meatballs in The Twilight Zone </b></p> 
<p><b>By Karl Isberg</b></p> 
<p>Karl Isberg, mild-mannered and affable small town newspaper editor, is in 
his vehicle, westbound on the highway out of the big city, heading home to 
Siberia With a View . It is a beautiful summer day; nothing out of the ordinary.
</p> 
<p>Or, so it seems.</p> 
<p>He's listening to a conservative radio talk show, the host saying the same 
simpleminded thing over and over, providing a brain-numbing mantra to those 
inclined to be affected by sophomoric, manly speech. Karl begins to fall asleep 
and, thus, turns to the &quot;progressive&quot; channel. No real difference: 
name-calling, stultifying and arbitrary chatter. Good to know, he thinks, that 
all extremists are essentially the same, that the edges of the political 
landscape are everywhere shallowly rooted in dense ground. Perhaps they'll all 
blow away some day, he thinks.</p> 
<p>All seems well. Karl has had a good breakfast, he has a few dollars in the 
checking account (as far as he knows), and he has a bottle of water (cleansed 
by the miracle of reverse osmosis) riding in the cup holder on the dash.</p> 
<p>He turns the radio channel to an oldies station (he is an oldie, after all) 
and he's humming along with one of his favorite Herman and the Hermits hits.</p>
<p>Little does he know, he is about to drive into The Twilight Zone. </p> 
<p>Cue the weird theme song.</p> 
<p>Doo dee doo-doo, doo dee doo-doo, doo dee doo-doo.</p> 
<p>As he motors up a steep hill something goes suddenly wrong with Karl's 
vehicle. One moment, Karl is traveling along at the speed limit (or a touch 
above) - the next moment, the engine sputters, the vehicle loses power. Karl 
gears down, searching for compression. It doesn't work.</p> 
<p>At first, Karl thinks it's him - that he is having another one of those 
irritating ischemic events. It'll pass, he thinks. It's probably a reaction to 
that Herman and the Hermits tune. Thank goodness it wasn't Jimi Hendrix ... I'd 
be in the ICU.</p> 
<p>But, no, it's the vehicle. As the vehicle loses momentum, Karl steers to 
the right lane and spots an intersection. He turns and coasts to the frontage 
road, swerving to the shoulder before the engine dies.</p> 
<p>He springs into action and goes through his mechanical problem checklist.
</p> 
<p>Let's see, the gas gauge registers full. So, that can't be it. </p> 
<p>He gets out of the vehicle, walks around it and checks the tires. Nothing 
flat, so that can't be it.</p> 
<p>These are the only items on his mechanical problem checklist. Everything 
else about autos and engines is a mystery to him.</p> 
<p>He turns the key. The starter makes its best effort, but the engine remains 
dead.</p> 
<p>He scans the mountainsides for signs of odd electric transmission towers, 
remembering that many years ago his cousin, Roger, attempted to build a 
facility nearby to test the more farfetched theories of Nicolai Tesla.</p> 
<p>Nothing.</p> 
<p>He holds his breath and clears his mind of internal dialogue, attempting to 
detect the oh-so-subtle hum that accompanies alien thought-projection. Aliens 
have been known to stop vehicles dead in their tracks and abduct the occupants 
in order to perform insidious and degrading probes.</p> 
<p>Nope. No hum detectable.</p> 
<p>Karl locates his cell phone on the front seat, beneath a stack of old Art 
in America magazines. After a few minutes time, during which he figures out how 
to turn the phone on, he calls his wife, Kathy, who is driving somewhere behind 
him on the highway.</p> 
<p>&quot;The darned thing is stone-cold dead,&quot; he says. &quot;I've 
determined it isn't an empty gas tank, flat tires, or a gigantic Tesla coil and 
accompanying balls of electricity. I'm pretty sure it isn't a mini stroke and 
there's no subtle hum, so it's not an alien invasion. I'm pretty much at my 
wit's end with this thing.&quot;</p> 
<p>&quot;Oh, please, don't tempt me with the wit's end thing; that's just too 
easy a target. Have you called triple A?&quot;</p> 
<p>&quot;Huh?&quot;</p> 
<p>&quot;Triple A. We pay them money every year so, if the car breaks down, 
they can tow it to someone who can fix it. You know, someone who looks for 
things that are wrong with it &#138; besides aliens and balls of electricity 
shooting through the air.&quot;</p> 
<p>Karl calls the company. This call may be recorded for training purposes. My 
name is Brian; how may I help you? A tow truck will be dispatched. The nearest 
approved mechanic is 40 miles away. Who knows when the tow truck will arrive. 
Have a nice day, sir.</p> 
<p>So, our intrepid traveler waits, standing beside a powerless vehicle on the 
shoulder of a dirt frontage road high in the Colorado mountains. And a storm is 
fast approaching, rolling over distant peaks and rushing eastward.</p> 
<p>Kathy arrives and dashes off to a nearby primitive shopette. She returns 
with a meatball sandwich, and advice from the proprietor.</p> 
<p>&quot;He says the best mechanic in these parts is just up this road. Said 
you'll know where he is, cause his place looks like a junkyard. Said he's been 
here a long time. Maybe too long. If you want some of my meatball sandwich, 
you'll go fetch him. She said his name is Harl.&quot;</p> 
<p>Harl?</p> 
<p>Karl?</p> 
<p>Doo dee doo-doo, doo dee doo-doo, doo dee doo-doo.</p> 
<p>Karl walks up the road. Clouds scud overhead, Lightning flashes, thunder 
crashes in the distance, dogs bark.</p> 
<p>He finds the location easily; junk cars litter a large expanse in front of 
a beat-up and metal building. In fact, cars are stacked atop cars. Rusted 
machinery is crammed between the car bodies. The door to the metal building is 
half open, like the maw of the Beastmaster's guard dog. The &quot;garage&quot; 
is stacked floor to ceiling with parts of machines, boxes of leaking 
who-knows-what. There is a narrow path leading back through the mountains of 
debris, into the darkness. Feral cats scatter as Karl calls out: &quot;Anybody 
here? Hallo. Anybody?&quot;</p> 
<p>He hears a radio playing in the distance. He follows the sound, groping his 
way past walls of slippery clutter. He finds a door, looks in and sees &#138;
</p> 
<p>More floor-to-ceiling debris - this time old mainframe computers stacked 
one on top of the other, many with amber and red lights flashing. And he sees 
an arm.</p> 
<p>The dirtiest arm he's ever seen.</p> 
<p>&quot;Anybody here,&quot; he calls.</p> 
<p>&quot;Just writin' some code. C'mon in. Gotta concentrate.&quot;</p> 
<p>Karl wedges himself past a stack of computer parts and peers around the 
corner. There, sitting on an old car seat with four scraggly cats, clutching a 
Big Gulp cup caked with grime, a filthy computer keyboard on his lap, is Harl.
</p> 
<p>Harl has long greasy gray hair falling from the sides of a major-league 
bald spot. He wears eyeglasses with 1970 frames held together with duct tape, 
one lens shattered and repaired with yellowed epoxy, and a T-shirt and a pair 
of jeans so dirty they could stand up by themselves. He is missing his front 
teeth and there is a cigarette jammed through the space where teeth 
(presumably) once were.</p> 
<p>&quot;Just finishin' up this here library. Look at that Compac there, will 
yuh? I love that Microsoft: they make everything obsolete so fast your head 
swims. Companies paid forty thousand for those Compacs and I can get them for 
fifteen bucks. Heh, heh. Finish this newest code, I can break into darned near 
anything. Whatcha need?&quot;</p> 
<p>Karl explains his predicament. The smell of oil and gasoline worries him. 
Particularly when Harl tosses a cigarette butt between the stacks of computers.
</p> 
<p>&quot;Oh yeah, yeah,&quot; says Harl. &quot;The 1500. Most folks think it's 
an S series. Couldn't be more wrong, Really the T series, but that's somethin' 
they don't want everyone to know. Fuel injection, you know? The Russkies wanted 
the secret to fuel injection and Chevy found a way to hide it from the Reds. As 
simple as a T instead of an S. Brilliant, downright brilliant. I'll grab a 
couple tools and we'll have a look at it. You like cats, do yuh?&quot;</p> 
<p>Karl and Harl waddle down the road. Kathy sees them coming and beats a 
hasty retreat to her car. Karl hears the door locks engage. She waves and takes 
a bite of meatball sandwich.</p> 
<p>Harl is under the car. &quot;Can't hear the pump. There's a relay that 
primes it before ignition. Personally, I think it was a bum relay that blew up 
Challenger and that teacher. And it wasn't there by accident, if you know what 
I mean. A bum relay don't just happen; homeschoolers put it there.&quot;</p> 
<p>Harl is stretched out across the engine of the vehicle, a gruesome divide 
widening between the bottom of his T-shirt and the top of his pants. He has 
attached a device to a spark plug. &quot;I can see a yellow spark. Funny thing, 
that yellow spark. Should be blue. You know, the favorite color of time 
travelers is yellow. Reminds them of the wormhole. Insane people like yellow a 
whole lot, too. This T-shirt used to be yellow. Did you hear that? Sounded like 
titanium plates banging together, didn't it? Somewhere off to the west, up the 
hill. Here 'em everyday, like clockwork. Makes you think.&quot;</p> 
<p>Harl has his head stuck inside the engine compartment, wedging it between 
the side of the truck and the motor. &quot;OK, try to crank this baby up. If my 
hair gets caught in the fan, I'll yell and you turn it off. Did you say you 
liked cats?&quot;</p> 
<p>Harl finally diagnoses the problem. &quot;Fuel pump. You're flat out of 
luck.&quot; A radio transmission comes out of nowhere. &quot;Darned if they 
don't have an ambulance call all the way up on the pass. Got my scanner here in 
my pocket. Told me they don't need me anymore. But, the day will come. Oh, yes, 
the day will come. Most people don't take these terrorists seriously, but I do. 
Yes, I do. I'm ready. Can't get a part until Monday at the earliest. Even then, 
bet you got a full tank of gas, don't you? Geez, I hate full tanks of gas when 
the fuel pump is in the tank. Those things can explode, you know? Had a bunch 
of 'em go up on me over the years. Barely got away with my life. Lost a couple 
mighty fine cats.&quot;</p> 
<p>Harl looks across the road, at Kathy, as she sits in her car, doors locked, 
wolfing down the last of the meatball sandwich.</p> 
<p>&quot;My, oh my. That is mighty fine.&quot;</p> 
<p>&quot;Beg your pardon?&quot;</p> 
<p>&quot;That is some fine stuff over there in that car.&quot;</p> 
<p>&quot;Harl, I don't think that's &#138;&quot;</p> 
<p>&quot;Nope, nuthin' finer than one of them meatball sandwiches. Have one 
nearly every day, when I can get away from the keyboard, Been writin' code, you 
know.&quot;</p> 
<p>The tow truck finally arrives.</p> 
<p>&quot;Well, Harl, since the truck is here,&quot; says Karl. &quot; I 
suppose I'll just go ahead and have him take my vehicle to the triple 
A-referred garage. You know those companies. They're mighty particular about 
who they do business with.&quot;</p> 
<p>&quot;Well, hell, if that's what you want. You could stay here for a night 
or two, wait until I get a part and fix 'er up. I got room. But, if you want to 
take it to some big, corporate-backed conglomerate, multinational place well, I 
suppose you get what you pay for. They killed Kennedy, you know. Wouldn't blink 
before they kill you. Did I ask if you like cats?&quot;</p> 
<p>Forty miles back to the city. Then, forty miles, packed into Kathy's car, 
back toward Siberia With a View, hours behind schedule.</p> 
<p>Suddenly, there it is. The intersection.</p> 
<p>&quot;Hmmmm,&quot; says Karl, attempting a bit of humor. &quot;Seems like 
we've been here before, doesn't it?&quot;</p> 
<p>Kathy turns, a pained look on her face.</p> 
<p>&quot;What did you say. I can't make out what you're saying. Can you hear 
that hum? The sound is deafening.&quot;</p> 
<p>Next trip through, thinks Karl, just in case, I'm toting a supply of 
meatball sandwiches.</p> 
<p>Easy business, and they'll be made with healthy turkey, in case Harl is 
prone to gout.</p> 
<p>To a pound of 85/15 turkey is added salt, pepper, some day-old bread crumbs 
softened in milk and squeezed nearly dry, oregano, basil, mashed garlic, 
chopped parsley, finely minced white onion, a beaten egg and a batch of freshly 
grated Parmesan cheese. The ingredients are combined and left to sit for a 
couple hours in the fridge, so the flavors meld.</p> 
<p>The meat is taken from the bowl with an ice cream scoop and each wad is 
shaped by hand into a ball. The balls are browned in olive oil over medium high 
heat, then removed from the pan. Some finely chopped white onion and sliced 
garlic is added to the pan and cooked until soft. The pan is deglazed with a 
bit of chicken broth and the broth is reduced. In goes some tomato sauce and a 
glob of tomato paste. The tomato is cooked until sweet and reduced. In goes 
salt, pepper to taste, oregano, basil, a bit of thyme and the meatballs go back 
in the pan to simmer for a while, covered, over medium low heat.</p> 
<p>Meanwhile, a large hunk of Italian or French bread is cut into a 
serving-size lengths, halved and the halves are toasted. On to the bread go 
slices of high-grade provolone. Meatballs are taken from the sauce, sliced, put 
on top of the cheese. On goes a slick of sauce from the pan, perhaps a drizzle 
of olive oil, some fresh basil, a sprinkling of grated Parmesan. The baby is 
closed and it is ready.</p> 
<p>I'll pack the sandwiches in a cooler and take it with me next time I drive 
past that intersection, thinks Karl. Just in case. And put the cooler right 
next to my tin foil hat.</p> 
<p>If I gotta go to The Twilight Zone again, I am going prepared. </p>

<p><b>Mind your mushrooms, there's a lot to lose </b></p> 
<p><b>By Bill Nobles</b></p> 
<p>There are 2,000 or more kinds of wild mushrooms throughout the United 
States. Some are poisonous and some are edible and delicious when properly 
prepared. The edibility of the majority is either not known or they are not 
considered for food because of their small size or poor flavor or texture.</p> 
<p>Even though not every one is interested in collecting mushrooms to eat, it 
is important to understand most have an important and beneficial role in the 
environment. They grow in a wide variety of habitats. Most of the mushrooms 
seen on a walk through a woods are beneficial. Many species are quite specific 
about their food source and will be found only under or near certain kinds of 
trees-some under pines, others under oak, etc. Some are important as decay 
organisms, aiding in the breakdown of logs, leaves, stems and other organic 
debris. This important role of mushrooms results in recycling of essential 
nutrients. Some mushrooms grow in, and form their fruiting structures on living 
trees causing decay of the sapwood or of the heartwood. Many woodland mushrooms 
are essential to good growth, and even survival of trees. They establish a 
relationship with roots of living trees that is mutually beneficial. These are 
called mycorrhizal mushrooms.</p> 
<p>All mushrooms, whether poisonous or edible can be admired for their beauty 
and the fantastic variety of form, color and texture. Which Mushrooms are Safe 
to Eat?</p> 
<p>Some edible mushrooms are very similar in appearance to poisonous kinds and 
may grow in the same habitat. Edible mushrooms are known to be safe to eat 
because they have been eaten frequently with no ill effects.</p> 
<p>Poisonous mushrooms are known because someone ate them and became ill or 
died. There is no test or characteristic to distinguish edible from poisonous 
mushrooms.</p> 
<p>This indicates a need to identify with certainty one of several of the 
proven edible species and pick and eat only those positively identified. At the 
same time, you should also learn to identify some of the common poisonous 
mushrooms, especially those that are similar to edible kinds. It is especially 
important to learn the characteristics of mushrooms which you are going to eat 
because several of the species are poisonous, a few causing serious illness and 
sometimes death.</p> 
<p>The word &quot;toadstool&quot; is often used to indicate a poisonous 
mushroom. Since there is no way to distinguish between a so-called 
&quot;toadstool&quot; and an edible mushroom it is more precise to speak of 
poisonous mushrooms or edible mushrooms. </p> 
<p>The season for collecting wild mushrooms usually begins after continuous 
rains in the upper elevations when the first morel, Shaggy mane, Giant 
Puffballs and/or sponge mushrooms are found. From mid summer to late autumn, a 
great variety of mushrooms may be found in Colorado. A number of these are 
choice edibles. Make sure you know what you are picking and eating? </p> 
<p>Edible versus poisonous</p> 
<p>True or false?</p> 
<p>1. Poisonous mushrooms tarnish a silver spoon. False</p> 
<p>2. If it peels, you can eat it. False </p> 
<p>3. All mushrooms growing on wood are edible. False</p> 
<p>4. Mushrooms that squirrels or other animals eat are safe for humans. False
</p> 
<p>5. All mushrooms in meadows and pastures are safe to eat. False</p> 
<p>6. All white mushrooms are safe. False</p> 
<p>7. Poisonous mushrooms can be detoxified by parboiling, drying or pickling. 
False</p> 
<p>Collecting wild mushrooms</p> 
<p>Be sure of your identification-eat only kinds known to be edible.</p> 
<p>- Do not eat mushrooms raw.</p> 
<p>- Eat only mushrooms in good condition.</p> 
<p>- Eat only one kind at a time and do not eat large amounts. Eat only a 
small amount the first time; even morels, generally considered to be excellent, 
may cause illness in some persons.</p> 
<p>- Don't experiment. There is an old saying, &quot;There are old mushroom 
hunters, and bold mushroom hunters, but there are no old, bold mushroom 
hunters.&quot; Obtain a copy of one or more books or publications on mushrooms.

<p><b>Broaden your culinary horizons at Thai cooking class </b></p> 
<p><b>By Ming Steen</b></p> 
<p><b>SUN Columnist</b></p> 
<p>Food is the integral part of the experience in Thailand. </p> 
<p>In Bankok, it seems you're never more than 30 feet from food and the 
opportunity to eat it. Streets and alleys are lined with makeshift stalls and 
well-worn carts that proffer hot and cold dishes assembled on the spot, usually 
by a sole entrepreneur.</p> 
<p>As decor goes, there isn't much at some of the restaurants either. Not 
unless your idea of atmosphere includes dining under fluorescent lights while 
ceiling-mounted televisions blast Thai soap operas. On the walls, enormous 
vintage posters of the Marlboro Man on horseback count as art.</p> 
<p>The show behind the food counters, on the other hand, is wildly 
entertaining. Cheerful and energetic staffers man individual booths that each 
sell a handful of specialties. In one, a young woman takes about 20 seconds to 
produce a crunchy, mouth-puckering green papaya salad by casually tossing the 
fruit, minced chilies, sprouts, crab, peanuts and fish sauce with a pinch of 
sugar in a big bowl while chatting with customers.</p> 
<p>An offer at the soup counter is a steaming bowl of shrimp, chicken and 
vegetables in a coconut broth with a spritz of hot sauce and raw onions.</p> 
<p>And at a third station, a cook theatrically juggles a deep frying pan over 
full flames, scrambling an egg while throwing in handfuls of noodles, dried 
shrimp, pork, spring onions, bean sprouts and some sugar and spices. The pad 
Thai is ready in minutes.</p> 
<p>Hungry? You're in luck. If you enjoy Thai cuisine, why not go to the 
source? Okay, maybe not so easily done. But how about taking a Thai cooking 
lesson from Pao Tallman on Saturday, Sept. 16, from 1-4 p.m.? Pao will share 
the secrets of her homeland cuisine with you. She trained and taught culinary 
students in Thailand, and has authored for Thai cookbooks. For answers to your 
questions, call 264-9348.</p> 
<p><b>Signs stolen</b></p> 
<p>The landscaping surrounding the entry to the recreation center has looked 
so good this spring and all summer. I wish to give our constant gardener, Dave 
Kenyon, a huge pat on the back. I always want to thank parents who have 
cooperated with staff to keep their children out of the flower beds.</p> 
<p>Sadly though, we lost the nicely crafted signs telling humans to stay out 
of the flowers. These are wooden, flower-shaped signs in bright colors. We have

<p><b>Terry Dee Windnagel</b></p> 
<p>Terry began this life May 24, 1947, in Longmont, Colorado, as the son of 
Emma and Donald Windnagel and brother to Peggy and Tom.</p> 
<p>Terry joined the United States Navy in 1968. He served with the Seawolf 
Helicopter Attack Squadron-Three in Southeast Asia until November 18, 1970. 
During his tour of duty in Vietnam, Terry flew over 400 combat missions, 
earning many personal ribbons and medals and combat unit citations. On November 
14, 2003, Terry was formally inducted into the Navy Enlisted Combat Aircrew 
Roll of Honor during a ceremony aboard the USS Yorktown located at Patriots 
Point Naval and Maritime Museum in Mount Pleasant, South Carolina. This 
induction is one of the highest honors bestowed on aircrew enlisted men who 
flew with distinction. Terry joined a select group of only 800 fellow patriots 
from World War II to the Vietnam War. Terry served with pride and respect, but 
also with a great sense of sadness for the loss of life.</p> 
<p>After returning from Vietnam, Terry spent his time backpacking, 
snowshoeing, bow-hunting and hiking in the Colorado Rockies. He met his wife, 
Susan, while snowshoeing near Mosquito Pass and they married in 1977. They 
continued a life outdoors and lived in Pagosa Springs for 20 years, during 
which time Terry volunteered as an EMT and firefighter. He also served as a 
member of the board of directors for the Pagosa Fire Protection District. He 
owned the Farmers Insurance Agency in Pagosa and always said that, &quot;every 
customer was a friend that he liked well enough to invite to dinner.&quot; 
Terry enjoyed a special friendship and kinship with his mother- and 
father-in-law, Dick and Betty Hillyer, who also resided in Pagosa. In 1989, 
Terry and Susan celebrated the birth of son, Corey, an event that was and still 
is the highlight of their lives. Terry attended every one of Corey's soccer 
games regardless of rain, sun, sleet or snow and shared in both victories and 
defeats. He loved being a part of Corey's life.</p> 
<p>After learning that Terry had esophageal cancer, he retired and wanted to 
move north. Spending several months traveling, the family fell in love with the 
mountains and oceans of the Pacific Northwest. Selling everything and 
relocating to the Glacier, Washington area was another adventure in Terry's 
life. The Hillyers also relocated to the Birch Bay area at the same time. Terry 
quickly made friends in the area and was instrumental in providing a new home 
for his family.</p> 
<p>Terry is survived and missed by his wife, son and in-laws; mother Emma 
Windnagel; sister Peggy Schwartzkopf; brother and wife Tom and Linda Windnagel; 
uncle and wife Ron and Chris Kingham; uncle Lee and Monie Kingham; aunt Georgia 
Benson; brother-in-law and wife Brian and Dottie Hillyer; and several cousins 
and nieces. He also leaves behind many dear friends in Colorado, New Mexico and 
Washington.</p> 
<p>On August 9, 2006, Terry completed this special life's journey to travel 
onto the next one, which he believed would be just as fascinating. Per his 
request, there will not be a formal memorial service; please remember his life 
at a family and friend picnic. In lieu of flowers please donate, in Terry's 
name, to the Pagosa Fire Protection District, Whatcom County Hospice, The 
American Cancer Society, or the Jacob Finkbonner Fund. Terry's final wish was 
that everyone &quot;Celebrate Life.&quot;</p>

<p>The wine and beer will flow and the hors d'oeuvres will be heavy as the 
Humane Society of Pagosa Springs hosts its 12th annual Auction for the Animals 
5:30 p.m. Friday at the community center. Staff and volunteers will have worked 
hard to transform the community center's multipurpose room into a showroom for 
collectibles, art work, furniture, pet gifts, and much more. There is something 
for everyone and the evening is packed with silent and live auctions.</p>

morsels to sustain you as you bid.</p>

<p>Start your Saturday morning off early by attending one of Pagosa's great 
community golf tournaments. The United Way Golf Tourney starts at 9 a.m. Aug. 
26 with a four-person scramble. There will be prizes, contests, golf giveaways, 
golf-related silent auction items, and lunch for the players. Come out early to

all you golfers on the course.</p> 
<p><b>Calling all cowboys</b></p> 
<p>You could golf in the morning and rope in the afternoon at the Chase 
Regester Memorial &quot;Buckle Up&quot; Team Roping event. Ropers can register 
around 4 p.m. after the services for this young resident . This rodeo event is 
always popular and fun to watch as men and women test their roping skills 
against those all-too-elusive calves. The event will be held at the Red Ryder 
arena. For more information, you can contact Diana Talbot at 731-5203.</p> 
<p><b>Mind's Material</b></p>

reception is from 5-8 p.m. with the gallery regularly open Tuesday, Thursday 
and Saturday from 1 - 4 p.m. and 1-6:30 p.m. on the second Thursday of the

Stop out to see these masterful contemporary works and meet the minds behind 
the material. If you miss the showing on this day, the exhibit continues until 
Oct. 7.</p> 
<p><b>Knights' spaghetti dinner</b></p> 
<p>You've been running around all day, so you certainly don't want to cook 
dinner!</p> 
<p>Let the Knights of Columbus do that for you and, once again, you'll support 
a great organization while it helps the three families of our young adults who 
were involved in that fatal accident several weeks ago. A benefit spaghetti 
dinner to help out the families of Chase Regester, Mickey Maestas, and Travis 
Stahr will be held 4-8 p.m. Saturday, Aug. 26. Enjoy all your events during the 
day and then come out for a relaxing evening with good food, great camaraderie, 
and awesome community service.</p> 
<p>After a very successful Duck Race (there wasn't a viewing space to be had 
on Hot Springs Boulevard), the Knights will turn around and put on another 
successful event. These guys just work so hard and do everything first class 
for this community. Tickets for the dinner are only $8 for adults and $5 for 
children 12 and younger. They may be purchased all over town, and of course, 
your Chamber of Commerce has them as well. The dinner will be held at the 
Immaculate Heart of Mary Parish Hall on Lewis Street. We thank this 
organization for once again thinking of those in need here in our community.</p>
<p>'<b>I Ought To Be In Pictures'</b></p> 
<p>This is the last week for Oteka Productions and the play &quot;I Ought To 
Be In Pictures&quot;. This Neil Simon play is performed under the stars at 3700 
CR 600 (Piedra Road). The show starts at 7 p.m. and food is available starting 
at 6 p.m. and desserts during intermission. Tickets are $18 each ($20 at the

at the Plaid Pony or Moonlight Books. Don't miss this last weekend of wit and 
humor in classic Neil Simon style. Shows are Aug. 24-26. Despite a few rainy 
performances, what a delight these productions have been to our town.</p> 
<p><b>Sky watch at Chimney Rock</b></p> 
<p>And if you can still keep your eyes open by now, or you haven't found a 
function that meets your needs, let's try one more: the sky watch program at 
Chimney Rock. The gates will open 7-7:30 p.m. and the program begins at 8. You 
learn about ancient sky watching as you hike up the mesa top trail to the Great 
House. There you can see this marvelous structure and learn about the ancient 
people who inhabited this area over 1,000 years ago. As night falls, you will 
see how the night sky works and how the ancient people might have used it. 
Tickets are $15 and admission is limited to only 40 people. For more 
information, contact the visitor center at 883-5359.</p> 
<p>What a full weekend of activities. </p> 
<p>We hope you will be able to make it to some of the events and support our 
great organizations as they give back to our community.</p> 
<p><b>Sidewalk sale</b></p> 
<p>It is hard to believe that the summer has flown by so quickly. Perhaps 
because we had so many events this year, the time seems to have gone by a 
little faster than usual. </p> 
<p>Nevertheless, school will be starting up soon, the colors will be changing, 
and with the fall comes our annual merchant sidewalk sale over the Labor Day 
holiday. Many of our downtown and River Center merchants often have sale items 
available on the walkways to attract customers, but this weekend merchants from 
the far west side of town to the far east side of town will pull out all the 
stops and help us celebrate the 10th anniversary of this sale.</p> 
<p>All around the town, merchants are offering great sales and merchandise to 
make way for all the new items that will be coming in for the fall. Many have 
just returned from market, so it's time to make way for all the new goodies. 
Come on out and support your local merchants by purchasing clothing, gifts, 
accessories and items for your home. Don't forget the west side of town has 
lots of sidewalks too, including the Pagosa Country Center and the Silverado 
Shopping Center. There is plenty of merchandise to be had from numerous great 
stores in this part of Pagosa. So, come on out and enjoy all the sales Friday, 
Sept. 1, to Monday, Sept. 4, and Shop Pagosa First. If I know these merchants, 
they may even start the weekend a little earlier - like they did last year.</p> 
<p><b>Members</b></p>

<p><b>Pirates open football season Saturday </b></p> 
<p><b>By Louis Sherman</b></p> 
<p><b>Staff Writer</b></p> 
<p>After a schedule alteration, Pirate football begins another drive toward 
the playoffs Saturday evening with a game against Bayfield high school.</p> 
<p>Another member of the newly-reorganized Intermountain League, Lake County, 
failed to field a team this year. This left the rest of the conference, 
including the Pirates, with too few games to be eligible for a wild card birth 
in the playoffs, making it necessary to add a game.</p> 
<p>While the top two teams in the conference will automatically make the 
playoffs, wild cards make it on their record and statistical tie-breakers, such 
as strength of schedule and total points. And if a team does not play enough 
conference games, it cannot be considered.</p> 
<p>As a result, teams in the conference have rescheduled their seasons, adding 
a &quot;zero week&quot; game with a nearby rival. The logical choice for the 
Pirates was the Wolverines. The away game will begin at 7 p.m.</p> 
<p>Pagosa may not have to worry about a wild card, however. Last season, the 
team finished first in the conference, losing only one regular season game to 
4A Montrose. They were undefeated in conference play at 4-0.</p> 
<p>This year, they look to improve on last year's playoff results. In 2005, 
the Pirates lost in the first-round to Holy Family of the Metro League, 45-27.
</p> 
<p>Head coach Sean O'Donnell said he is &quot;excited about our group ... 
they're spirited and enthusiastic.&quot; O'Donnell said he was impressed with 
the work ethic his team has shown so far.</p> 
<p>A total of 61 players came out for two-a-day practices last week, including 
16 seniors. Seven varsity starters will return to both the offensive and 
defensive squads.</p> 
<p>When asked who the players were to watch, O'Donnell said, &quot;I'd like to 
give you everybody's name for the work they're doing right now.&quot; O'Donnell 
emphasized that his team's success will be based on its strong collective 
effort.</p> 
<p>This year's two-a-days have focused on conditioning in the morning and 
playbook and drills in the afternoon.</p> 
<p>Aside from the running that is typically associated with 
&quot;conditioning,&quot; the team also employs a relatively new training 
regimen called &quot;dynamic stretching.&quot; According to O'Donnell, the 
practice began in the higher levels of organized sport and has slowly trickled 
down to high school teams.</p> 
<p>Rather than the stationary, or static stretches we can all remember from 
P.E. class years ago, dynamic stretching includes slow, controlled movements to 
increase flexibility, stamina, and power. Rather than touch your toes, dynamic 
stretching would have you do high kicks over a distance of 20 yards.</p> 
<p>The team also spends time in the weight room twice during the week, 
performing power-oriented lifts such as cleans, squats and bench presses that 
work a variety of large muscle groups.</p> 
<p>Despite the team's attention to strength and endurance, injuries remain a 
concern.</p> 
<p>Last year's starting running back Corbin Mellette, now a senior, broke his 
hand in last Thursday's practice. He has been given the go-ahead to play by his 
doctor. The coaching staff will now evaluate whether he can take handoffs and 
carry the football with a cast.</p> 
<p>Three other capable runners - Matt Gallegos, Eric Heard and Mike Smith - 
are available to step in if necessary.</p> 
<p>The Pirates run a spread option offense out of the shotgun, with one 
tailback and four wide receivers. O'Donnell said he will also put in a tight 
end during some plays, replacing one of the wideouts. The team will likely run 
the ball 60 to 70 percent of the time.</p> 
<p>On defense, the Pirates will use a 3-5-3 setup - three defensive linemen, 
five linebackers and three defensive backs. This setup is well suited for small 
and quick defenses. It allows a defense to quickly adjust to an offense and 
employ a variety of man coverages and blitzes.</p> 
<p>The 3-5-3 can potentially run into trouble against power running teams, 
like Holy Family. Without a larger defensive line, opposing offensive linemen 
can often throw unevaded blocks on one or more of the five linebackers. If the 
other linebackers are on a blitz or in coverage, the center of the field can be 
open for a long run.</p> 
<p>The Pirates schedule includes some tough teams, including state runner-up 
Buena Vista, which is now in the Intermountain League after conference 
reconfiguration. Other challenging games will be against 3A Alamosa, who the 
Pirates beat for the first time in 20 years last season, and Monte Vista. </p> 
<p>The Pirates first home game, against Kirtland Central, will be Friday, 
Sept. 8, at 7 p.m.</p>

<p><b>Golf season opens for high school varsity </b></p> 
<p><b>By Louis Sherman</b></p> 
<p><b>Staff Writer</b></p> 
<p>Five Pagosa Springs high schoolers competed in two golf tournaments last 
week, claiming eighth- and sixth-place team finishes.</p> 
<p>The first two-day tournament in Montrose took place at the Black Canyon 
Golf Club and Cobble Creek Golf Course Wednesday and Thursday of last week.</p> 
<p>Black Creek is an old municipal course with prominent treelines hugging the 
fairways (par 70), while Cobble Creek is a newer links course with large greens 
(par 72).</p> 
<p>The Pirates finished eighth out of 18 on the first day of competition and 
ninth out of 20 on the second. They finished eighth overall with combined 
scores of 242 and 248 (measuring the top three players), on the first and 
second day respectively.</p> 
<p>On Friday the team moved on to another municipal course in Alamosa, 
Cattails Golf Club (par 71). </p> 
<p>After two days of competition and many miles of travel, the team 
&quot;looked really tired,&quot; said Coach Mark Faber.</p> 
<p>Despite the lack of energy, the Pirates pulled off a sixth-place finish out 
of 18 teams, with a combined score of 253.</p> 
<p>Sophomore Clark Riedberger led the Pirates in all three days of competition 
with scores of 75, 80 and 83. </p> 
<p>He was joined in the tournaments by juniors Clay Vickers, scoring 82, 83 
and 84; Caleb Burggraaf, 92, 85 and 93; and Cody Bahn, 85, 86 and 86; and 
sophomore Jeremy Lister, who only played at Black Canyon, scoring 87.</p> 
<p>The Pirates competed again yesterday at Cortez, but their scores were 
unavailable by press time, and they have a tournament today in Durango.</p> 
<p>More importantly, there will be a home tournament tomorrow at the Pagosa 
Springs Golf Club, beginning at 9 a.m.</p> 
<p>Because the tournament is at home, Faber said, &quot;We'll play as many 
kids as we can.&quot;</p>

<p><b>Pagosa golfers fare well in team play event </b></p> 
<p><b>By Lynne Allison</b></p> 
<p><b>Special to The SUN</b></p> 
<p>The Pagosa Women's Golf Association sent eight of its low-handicap players 
to Dalton Ranch Golf Club in Durango for a team play event Aug. 17.</p> 
<p>The Pagosa team of Lynne Allison, Marilyn Smart, Jane Day, Bonnie Hoover, 
Cherry O'Donnell, Audrey Johnson, Josie Hummel and Doe Stringer garnered 43 
points - their highest total to date this season - against San Juan Country 
Club. </p>

<p>A Ryder Cup format was played over two days between The Pagosa Springs Golf 
Club and The Rio Grande Club. The first day of play was at Rio Grande, with the 
host club taking a 29 to 25 lead.</p> 
<p>The second day of play at Pagosa saw the home team come from behind to win 
the Cup with a two-day total of 55 to 53 points.</p> 
<p>Superb play on the second day by Jim Hitchcox, David Prokop, Gene Johnson

<p><b>Soccer training includes Wolf Creek Pass run </b></p> 
<p><b>By Louis Sherman</b></p> 
<p><b>Staff Writer</b></p> 
<p>There is a lot more to Pirates soccer than shooting on goal.</p> 
<p>Last Friday, all of the 27 players who came out for soccer ran eight miles 
up Wolf Creek pass, climbing about half of a mile in elevation. And for the 
first time since the tradition began, everyone reached the summit.</p> 
<p>Many of the players finished the run averaging 13-minute miles, including 
brief stops for stretching and water.</p> 
<p>Coach Lindsey Kurt-Mason said the purpose of the run was to build both team 
and individual confidence and determination.</p> 
<p>&quot;When the kids do something like that it just strengthens their 
spirit, and it shows the endurance that they can muster,&quot; Kurt-Mason said.
</p> 
<p>Players described the experience as &quot;painful&quot; but &quot;awesome 
when you get to the top.&quot; Others said that it gave them a &quot;great 
sense of accomplishment.&quot;</p> 
<p>During the run, Kurt-Mason encouraged players to run and finish as a team. 
</p> 
<p>This is the 12th consecutive season of boys' high school soccer. According 
to Kurt-Mason, the high school program has encouraged organized soccer at 
younger ages, and current players have many years of play under their belts.</p>
<p>The Pirates boast a team full of upper classmen, with eight seniors and six 
juniors.</p> 
<p>The skill is there; now the team is able to spend much of its time on 
tactics, teamwork and playing smart. </p> 
<p>During a week of two-a-days and a second week of afternoon practices, the 
team has utilized &quot;focus&quot; drills to prepare their minds for the games 
to come.</p> 
<p>One drill required players to run on goal, shoot and immediately switch 
over to defense. Kurt-Mason said that the point was to take the players' focus 
away from the outcome of the shot and put it on the continuing game.</p> 
<p>Other drills have focused on quick thinking, while hours of conditioning 
will help players get through 90-minute games and a 15-match season.</p> 
<p>In another drill, players were required to respond quickly to the vocal 
cues of another player. When &quot;head&quot; was yelled, the ball was to be 
caught. When &quot;hand&quot; was yelled, the player was to head the ball back 
to his teammate.</p> 
<p>Kurt-Mason said that he hoped the team's determined preseason work will 
also help players make smart and healthy choices off the field.</p> 
<p>He expressed confidence that the team will make the playoffs if they can 
stay healthy and eligible to play.</p> 
<p>Last season, the Pirates made the second round of the playoffs after 
beating James Irwin high school. They were knocked out of competition by 
Arvada's Faith Christian. </p> 
<p>The team finished last season at 6-5-1.</p> 
<p>The Pirates will face stiff competition this year from conference rivals 
Crested Butte, which won the league last year, and Telluride.</p> 
<p>They play both teams twice during the season.</p> 
<p>The Pirates' first season game is at home against Manitou Springs, a week 
from Saturday.</p> 
<p>More immediately, players will have an opportunity to test their game legs 
Saturday, when they will play in five scrimmages beginning at 9 a.m. at Golden 
Peaks Stadium. </p> 
<p>Six teams will compete throughout the day, including Aztec, Bayfield, 
Cortez, Durango, Telluride and Pagosa.</p>

<p><b>Cross country, a 'metaphor for life' </b></p> 
<p><b>By Louis Sherman</b></p> 
<p><b>Staff Writer</b></p> 
<p>The Pirates cross country team has logged hundreds of miles on town streets 
and local trails in preparation for the upcoming season.</p> 
<p>Forty-five total runners have come out for the boys' and girls' teams this 
year, making them virtually impossible to miss on the morning drive to work.</p>
<p>While younger runners have worked primarily on endurance, veterans have 
sought to build their running strength. The team combines hill and tempo work 
with the usual run-around.</p> 
<p>In &quot;tempo&quot; work, runners go at 80-percent effort, a good canter, 
for up to 22 minutes.</p> 
<p>Runners also pay close attention to nutrition, getting the bulk of their 
calories from complex carbohydrates and avoiding typical teenage fare, such as 
soda and junk foods.</p> 
<p>They are also encouraged to eat at least four meals a day, to keep a 
continual flow of nutrients in the bloodstream and replenish energy stores.</p> 
<p>Head coach Scott Anderson described &quot;cross-country as a metaphor for 
life,&quot; implying that it could lead to better all-around health.</p> 
<p>Both the girls' and boys' teams qualified for state last year, the girls 
finishing sixth and the boys 15th.</p> 
<p>The girls were led by senior Emilie Schur, who was selected for the 
all-state team four years straight. </p> 
<p>Four runners from the state competition will return to the girls team, 
while three boys will return.</p> 
<p>&quot;We are anticipating the guys to be really strong this year,&quot; 
Anderson said.</p> 
<p>According to Anderson, age makes all the difference with male runners, 
since it often equates to greater strength.</p> 
<p>The boy's team will have two seniors and one junior returning from last 
year's state competition.</p> 
<p>On the other hand, &quot;girls often show up early ... It's not uncommon to 
have several freshman show up in the top ten at state,&quot; said Anderson.</p> 
<p>There will be openings in both teams for new runners. Individuals qualify 
for meets based on previous times. &quot;We take the six most competitive kids, 
peaking at the right time,&quot; said Anderson.</p> 
<p>The teams will run on a variety of courses this year. Some will be hill 
races, demanding strength as well as endurance. Then there are the rolling 
courses, in which the physical demand varies from one stretch to another, and 
the golf courses, which are flat and fast.</p> 
<p>The Pirates' first meet is next Saturday in Bayfield, with a start time of 
9 a.m.</p>

<p><b>Porpoise swimmers shine in end-of-season meets </b></p> 
<p>The Pagosa Lakes Porpoises, Pagosa's 20 member swim club wrapped up its 
2006 season in fine fashion at the seasonal state meet Aug. 4-6 in Craig.</p> 
<p>With just eight of the 13 qualified swimmers participating, the Porpoises 
finished a very respectable ninth place overall. Many of the other 24 teams 
from around the state had 30 or more swimmers participating.</p> 
<p>Three Pagosa swimmers won overall high-point honors in their respective age 
groups.</p> 
<p>Aaron Miller, who has been swimming with the Porpoises for 9 years, earned 
high-point honors in his 15-18 age group for the second year in a row. He 
turned in six first-place, one second-place and two third-place finishes.</p> 
<p>This season, Miller clocked times that qualified him to represent the state 
of Colo. at the Western Zone meet held in Fresno, Calif. Aug. 7-13. The 
Colorado team took fourth overall. Qualified swimmers from nine western states, 
17 teams in all, competed in this meet. Miller proved a tough competitor, 
bringing home fifth place in the 1,500-meter freestyle, taking nearly a minute 
off of his previous best time. He also finished sixth in the 800 freestyle and 
10th in the 400 freestyle.</p> 
<p>Also winning high-point honors for the second year in a row at the seasonal 
state meet was 9 -year-old D.J. Brown. He logged three Junior Olympic 
qualifying times and brought in six first-place finishes and two second-place 
finishes for a total of 129 points out of 144 possible.</p> 
<p>On the girls' side, Emily Bryant garnered high-point honors in the 9-10 age 
group with an amazing performance on her birthday weekend. Bryant blew away her 
competition, setting a new state record in the 100-meter backstroke and four 
new pool records in her other events. She took first place in all her events in 
Sunday's competition, bringing home a total of six first-place finishes and two 
seconds.</p> 
<p>Rounding out those competing at state and contributing greatly to the 
team's performance were Gage Lovett, Briana Bryant, Austin Miller, Dane Murdoch 
and Kai Koch.</p> 
<p>Qualified but unable to attend the meet were Erica Pitcher, Katie 
Armbrecht, Daniel Armbrecht, Dean Scott and Spence Scott.</p> 
<p>Just missing the cut times were the team's other members: Samara Hernandez, 
Kelsey Anderson, Sydney Aragon, Shea Johnson, Kalie Ray, Dylan Caves and 
first-year members Clint Walkup and Zack Irons.</p> 
<p>Coached by Jennifer Fenton and Stephen Williams, all members of the 
Porpoises had shining performances in the eight meets they attended around the 
state. Each swimmer cut significant time off of their personal bests. The 
Porpoises have shown tremendous effort and dedication.</p> 
<p>Beginning in the fall, Fenton will be cultivating a new pod of potential 
Porpoises, working with the 8 and under age group. Coach Fenton will train the 
young swimmers in stroke technique, competition starts and turns, as well as 
building endurance.</p> 
<p>If you have a child interested in finding out more about the swim club,

<p> </p> <b>Editorial</b> 
<p></p> 
<p><b>A fine role model </b> </p> 
<p>With the primary elections a thing of the past, the slate is now set for 
upcoming regional general election races for the Colo-rado Legislature. We have 
a representative's seat up for grabs in our district, a Senate seat to be 
contested. As candidates prepare campaigns for the final two months - 
Republican Ellen Roberts and Democrat Joe Colgan for the rep's slot, and 
Democrat incumbent Jim Isgar and Republican Ron Tate for the Senate - we think 
there is enough of a lull in activity to say this without tainting the 
proceedings: We are going to miss Rep. Mark Larson and what he stands for. He 
is a role model for anyone who takes office next year.</p> 
<p>In our opinion, he has been the finest elected official the district could 
have hoped for, and he will be sorely missed - despite the fact he will, we 
hope, live longer and happier without the stress of a race and another term in 
the Legislature.</p> 
<p>Why will we miss him? Easy: His honesty, his integrity, his dedication to 
research and to acquiring knowledge concerning issues. His unswerving loyalty 
to constituents. </p> 
<p>And, perhaps most of all because, though a Republican - with no intent of 
being otherwise - Larson has shown a remarkable ability to do what most 
contemporary politicians cannot do, either out of ignorance or fear: namely, 
think for himself and be generally non-partisan in his approach to public 
service.</p> 
<p>It is a skill that has, on several occasions, put him on the hot seat with 
members of his party. It is a tendency we admire and that we wish more leaders 
would develop.</p> 
<p>We live in increasingly partisan times, and nasty times they are, with 
party hacks on both sides filling our eyes and ears with superficial, arbitrary 
ideas reduced to a third-grade level in a condescending attempt to curry favor 
using the lowest common denominator. More and more, name-calling and the use of 
virtually meaningless but emotionally loaded labels is the order of the day in 
political discourse.</p> 
<p>Unfortunately, it works a lot of the time, with a great many people.</p> 
<p>What a refreshing phenomenon, a politician like Larson. Look at his recent 
activity. He actively supports enhanced mental health care. He supports 
referenda designed to ease the burden of constitutional amendments on the state 
budget, and leads the battle against that burden from the get-go.</p> 
<p>He demands voters hold elected officials and bureaucrats accountable. He 
leads the battle to minimize certain kinds of contributions to legislators 
while maintaining legitimate sources of assistance that allow rural legislators 
to do their jobs. He advocates pragmatic solutions to seemingly overwhelming 
problems like illegal immigration. He detects possible influence peddling and 
political hijinks concerning a controversial development project outside his 
district and calls for action. He is in the middle of the creation of 
legislation restricting smoking in public places and is there unashamedly, 
putting health and general welfare above the individual rights call of partisan 
thinkers.</p> 
<p>And, perhaps more than anything else, he is unafraid to endorse a candidate 
for governor, from the other party.</p> 
<p>The man thinks for himself. And he thinks, always, with the best interests 
of his constituents in mind. Not the party line. Not the demands of partisan 
parrots and reductionists. He does not frame the world as do more limited souls 
- those for whom political affiliation serves some deep but simple need.</p> 
<p>We long for some at-least-faint reflections of Larson's brand of fearless, 
well-informed, well-meaning and principled behavior in candidates as the races 
for House and Senate seats progress The time for knee-jerk partisan thought is 
over; it is dragging us down as a society. It is in concert with leaders like 
Larson that we will remain strong, creative and free of the burden of limited 
political thought.</p>

Creek Pass highway, took place according to schedule, Monday, Aug. 21. As 
originally planned the ceremonies were to be held at the summit of the pass, 
10,800 feet high, but, owing to various reasons, the dedication of the new road 
was held 12 miles below the summit on the other side, in Box Canyon. Here were

<p><b>Big player from a small school</b></p> 
<p><b>makes her mark in college sport </b></p> 
<p><b>By Sarah O. Smith</b></p> 
<p><b>Staff Writer </b></p> 
<p>It's no secret that student athletes have it tough; hours of practice piled 
up on hours of homework is enough to prompt any student to abandon the library 
for the field, or vice versa. But in this battle of brains versus brawn, some 
students break even.</p> 
<p>A bright spot on the basketball and volleyball teams here in town, 2002 
Pagosa Springs High School graduate Ashley Gronewoller, 21, continued her 
legacy on the court when she joined the Colorado School of Mines basketball 
team four years ago. In March, Gronewoller played her last game for the CSM 
Orediggers, but not without several titles under her arm and a true Cinderella 
story in her wake.</p> 
<p>Gronewoller had a full plate at Mines: she spent an estimated five hours a 
day in the gym practicing basketball, and she said there was only one semester 
when she took less than 19 credit hours - the equivalent of around six 
full-time classes. When Gronewoller was a freshman, her basketball team held a 
4-24 record; admittedly, she said, not something worth celebrating.</p> 
<p>&quot;No one expected anything from us,&quot; said Gronewoller. &quot;It 
was okay for us to suck at sports, because we were smart. But that mentality 
started to change.&quot;</p> 
<p>The Colorado School of Mines is notorious for its rigorous workload and 
demanding curriculum, often specializing in the different branches of 
engineering.</p> 
<p>&quot;Mines has always been the nerd school,&quot; said Gronewoller. 
&quot;But it's not just about the academics anymore. It was fun to be part of 
that transition.&quot;</p> 
<p>By the time Gronewoller's four-year basketball career was over, the CSM 
Orediggers had beat the odds and pulled off the unbelievable; despite the young 
team (Gronewoller was the only senior) and &quot;losing some games we shouldn't 
have,&quot; they inched their way into the Rocky Mountain Athletic Conference 
(RMAC) tournament March 1 at the No. 8 seed and beat top-seeded Regis 
University 71-57, becoming the first ever No. 8 seed to beat a No. 1 seed in 
the 14 years of RMAC tournament history.</p> 
<p>&quot;The clock just couldn't tick fast enough,&quot; said Gronewoller of 
the monumental game.</p> 
<p>The Orediggers went on the beat the No. 4-seeded University of 
Nebraska-Kearney 67-61 in the second tournament game March 4, a team that had 
beat the Orediggers in both regular season games.</p> 
<p>&quot;That game was probably even more fun,&quot; said Gronewoller. 
&quot;They really 'hometown' you. But we won.&quot;</p> 
<p>These two tournament victories were a first in the Mines program's 30 
years, allowing the Orediggers to reach the RMAC championship game - another 
first in the program's history, giving fans of the team that no one expected 
anything from something special to cheer about.</p> 
<p>The incredible run came to a halt in the championship game March 5 when the 
Orediggers lost to Colorado State University-Pueblo 65-54.</p> 
<p>But the record-breaking didn't end there.</p> 
<p>In her last game at CSM, Gronewoller beat school records, including most 
points scored in a season (450). These records were added to her distinctions 
of most total points in a career (1,466), most total rebounds in a year (890), 
best career field goal percentage (57.4), best season field goal percentage 
(58.9), and most free throws made in a career (288). She also topped the list 
of season leaders all four years, and made the RMAC All-League team.</p> 
<p>Come fall, the record-breaker with a brain is headed back to school for her 
final semester at Mines. She'll end her academic career with a major in 
economics and business and a minor in biomedical engineering.</p> 
<p>For now, Gronewoller said her plans are up in the air; she may work in an 
engineering firm for a while, or go back to school for her Ph.D. and become a 
professor. But one things she's very keen on is receiving her nursing degree, 
as she's interested in oncology or pediatrics.</p> 
<p>&quot;We'll see,&quot; she said. &quot;(Nurses) don't have to specialize 
for a million years like doctors. You can jump from field to field more easily 
as your interests change.&quot;</p> 
<p>But this may not be the end of basketball for Gronewoller. She's also 
considering travelling to compete in one of the many professional leagues 
overseas. She currently has an agent in Germany who can help her find a spot on 
one of the teams in Holland, Norway, Spain, Greece, Austria, Ireland and many 
other countries.</p> 
<p>&quot;It's kind of fun to think about,&quot; she said. &quot;It's something 
I think would be fun, because I love basketball.&quot;</p> 
<p>Standing at 6 feet 3 inches, Gronewoller admits she has a distinct 
advantage above other girls vying for a spot on the teams.</p> 
<p>&quot;A lot of teams over there need that height,&quot; she said.</p> 
<p>If Gronewoller were to join a team overseas, things like housing and food 
would be paid for by the league.</p> 
<p>&quot;It'd be pretty sweet to get paid to play. I have so many people 
saying, 'You have to do it, it's a free trip to Europe,'&quot; she said. 
&quot;But it's not like I'd be sight-seeing. I'd be looking at a lot of 
European gyms.&quot;</p> 
<p>Gronewoller said the level of difficulty and competition for each team 
vary; some teams would thrive in the WNBA, while others are comparable to a 
college level. But no matter what the competition level, the commitment level 
is a huge step up from college basketball. She would be looking at 10 to 11 
months of basketball, with practice three to four times a day; something that, 
Gronewoller admits, makes her a bit nervous.</p> 
<p>&quot;It's sad that I might be done with basketball,&quot; she said. 
&quot;But I don't know if I want to saturate my life with basketball.&quot;</p> 
<p>No matter where basketball takes Gronewoller in the future, the &quot;big 
player from a small school&quot; has certainly left her mark at Mines. Not only 
has she changed the landscape of athletics there, but she's also subverted the 
typical role of the student athlete, proving that the &quot;nerd school&quot; 
can pack some pretty big muscles, too.</p>

<p><b>Harsh conditions for the Jicarilla Apache </b></p> 
<p><b>By John M. Motter</b></p> 
<p>We've been reporting on pre-reservation Jicarilla Apache life as reported 
by Juan Dedios to Anthropologist Frank Gribben in 1933 and reported in 
&quot;The Jicarilla Apache, A History, 1846-1970,&quot; by Dr. Veronica E. 
Velarde Tiller, a tribal historian.</p> 
<p>Dedios identified a large number of places used by the Jicarilla for 
hunting camps and religious purposes during the 1860s and 1870s. The current 
Jicarilla Reservation was formally established by presidential decree in 1887.
</p> 
<p>Many of the family names mentioned by Dedios remain common family names in 
Dulce, including his own. An exception is the name Mundo, which was changed to 
Velarde a short time before the reservation was formed. It is well to remember 
that the events reported and the people involved are as real a part of 
Jicarilla family memories today as are the memories of whites who trace their 
family trees back to this or that place or event.</p> 
<p>Dedios's information was used as the basis for Jicarilla land claims, 
supported by a Stanford University grant and study that resulted in a 
multi-million dollar settlement, the first big money available to the 
Jicarilla. The Stanford study is described in an available book titled 
&quot;Tipi Rings,&quot; written by members of a law firm that helped the tribe 
win the settlement.</p> 
<p>It should also be reported that Dedios was ostracized by leading members of 
the community, he was kicked out of the community, and young people instructed 
to forget his name as if he had never lived. Such was the penalty for revealing 
tribal secrets to outsiders.</p> 
<p>A current tribal medicine man told me that elders told him, &quot;If you 
tell your enemy how to make your weapons, they'll use those weapons against 
you.&quot;</p> 
<p>Continuing with Dedios's report as recorded in Tiller's book we read: 
&quot;Dedios described the trading among the Jicarilla, Utes, and white 
travelers who crossed Raton Pass, the mountain branch of the Santa Fe Trail. 
The Indians traded beaver skins, hides, and medicinal plants for meat. Trade 
camps were also set up, two of which he attended at Cimarron and Mora. Here all 
kinds of goods were exchanged.</p> 
<p>&quot;The government rations issued at the Abiquiu and Cimarron agencies 
did not escape Dedios's attention. Everyone received rations; some hung around 
the agencies just for the rations, which they sold and ended up without food. 
Others had their rations stolen by the soldiers. These Indians retaliated by 
stealing from settlers. He recalled one incident when some Apaches raided the 
ranches near Tierra Azul and soldiers were called out who shot the Indians.</p> 
<p>&quot;Inadequate rations and scarcity of game led to the raiding, but also 
forced some Jicarilla to cultivate crops. Dedios remembered the corn fields 
along the Little Cimarron that were planted by the Llaneros (Motter &#151; the 
Plains Clan, also known as the Red Clan. To this day, the Jicarilla are divided 
into the Ollero, or Mountain or White clans, and the Llanero or Plains or Red 
Clan. The focal point of the September Go Jii Ya celebration, the biggest 
religious fete of the year for the Jicarilla, is a relay race between these two 
clans).</p> 
<p>&quot;Despite all the favorable views about the Jicarilla attempting to 
prove their worthiness and efforts toward self reliance, there was little 
chance that the people of Cimarron would consent to the purchase of the Rayado 
Tract or any area of land for a permanent reservation. Inextricably tied to the 
inevitable rejection of the Jicarilla was the 1866 discovery of gold on Willow 
Creek, and prospectors overflowed into the nearby gullies on the western slopes 
of Baldy Mountain.&quot;</p> 
<p>More next week on the pre-reservation life of the Jicarilla Apache.</p>

<p><b>Relax, Pluto is (probably) still a planet </b></p> 
<p><b>By James Robinson</b></p> 
<p><b>Staff Writer</b></p> 
<p>The following sun and moon data is provided by the United States Naval 
Observatory.</p> 
<p>Sunrise: 6:32 a.m.</p> 
<p>Sunset: 7:48 p.m.</p> 
<p>Moonrise: 7:15 a.m.</p> 
<p>Moonset: 8:24 p.m.</p> 
<p>Moon phase: The moon is waxing crescent with one percent of the visible 
disk illuminated.</p> 
<p>Depending on the outcome of the International Astronomical Union's (IAU) 
general assembly in Prague, our solar system could soon become a very different 
place. </p> 
<p>According to IAU President Ron Ekers, the assembly is currently debating a 
draft resolution that, if adopted, would change the definition of a planet and 
would add at least three new planets to our solar system.</p> 
<p>Under the resolution, to be decided this afternoon, &quot;A planet is a 
celestial body that (a) has sufficient mass for its self-gravity to overcome 
rigid body forces so that it assumes a hydrostatic equilibrium (nearly round) 
shape, and (b) is in orbit around a star, and is neither a star nor a satellite 
of a planet.&quot;</p> 
<p>In layman's terms and according to the draft definition, two conditions 
must therefore be met before an object can be called a planet. First, the 
object must orbit a star but not be a star itself. Second, the object must be 
massive enough such that its own gravity pulls the object into a nearly 
spherical shape. </p> 
<p>&quot;Our goal was to find a scientific basis for a new definition of 
planet and we chose gravity as the determining factor. Nature decides whether 
or not an object is a planet,&quot; said Richard Binzel, IAU planet definition 
committee member.</p> 
<p>With the proposed definition, Pluto retains its planetary status, while its 
moon, Charon, would also become a planet. In addition, Ceres, the largest known 
asteroid which orbits the sun between Mars and Jupiter, would become a planet, 
as would 2003 UB 313, an object larger and more distant than Pluto. Mike Brown 
and his colleagues at the California Institute of Technology discovered 2003 
UB313 in 2005.</p> 
<p>If the definition is approved and the resolution succeeds, the three 
planetary newcomers would join the ranks of the nine traditional planets, 
already identified as such, in our solar system - Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, 
Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune and Pluto. Furthermore, the IAU has a dozen 
more planetary candidates on its ever-evolving planetary &quot;watchlist&quot; 
and, if the resolution passes, these and many more objects could be added in 
the near future.</p> 
<p>Under the proposed IAU definition, Pluto would serve as the prototype for a 
new class of planetary objects called &quot;plutons.&quot; Plutons, according 
to the resolution, are distinguished from the classical planets in &quot;that 
they reside in orbits around the sun that take longer than 200 years to 
complete.&quot; In addition, they have highly tilted orbits relative to the 
classical planets, and have a large orbital eccentricity, or, an orbit that is 
far from circular. Along with Pluto, Charon and 2003 UB313 would be classified 
as &quot;plutons.&quot;</p> 
<p>Speaking to NASA, Brown said, &quot;If passed, the resolution will make 
anything in the solar system that's large enough to be round, due to its own 
gravitational pull, into a planet. So that would add the nine things that we 
currently know of as planets would still be planets. And it would add three 
more. It would add Ceres, the largest asteroid, and it would also add 2003 
UB313, the large Kuiper Belt object that was discovered last year in the region 
outside of Neptune. It would also add Pluto's moon, Charon, as a bona fide 
planet in its own right.&quot;</p> 
<p>In an Aug. 17 article in space.com, Brown was less diplomatic. He called 
the overall proposal &quot;a complete mess,&quot; and added that by his count, 
the proposed definition means there are currently 53 known objects eligible for 
planetary status with the possibility for countless additions.</p> 
<p>He and other critics have questioned the definition, and have argued that 
under its parameters, our moon should be considered a planet. In addition, the 
definition allows for another subclass of planets, called dwarf planets, and 
the possibility for double, or even triple planets.</p> 
<p>Whereas Brown and IAU critics see the definition and subsequent resolution 
as arbitrary and contradictory, IAU planet definition committee chair Owen 
Gingerich says otherwise.</p> 
<p>In an effort to resolve the planetary classification problem, the IAU 
executive committee, led by Ekers, formed a seven-person, planet definition 
committee, and the group set to work on tackling one of modern astronomy's most 
vexing and contentious problems - providing a contemporary definition for 
&quot;planet&quot; that takes into consideration advanced observational 
technologies and new discoveries, including that of 2003 UB 313.</p> 
<p>&quot;Modern science provides much more knowledge than the simple fact that 
objects orbiting the sun appear to move with respect to the background of fixed 
stars. For example, recent new discoveries have been made of objects in the 
outer regions of our solar system that have sizes comparable to and larger than 
Pluto. These discoveries have rightfully called into question whether or not 
they should be considered as new 'planets,'&quot; Ekers said.</p> 
<p>After two years exploring the problem, the committee met in Paris during 
June and July 2006 and reached a unanimous consensus for a proposed definition.
</p> 
<p>&quot;In July we had vigorous discussions of both the scientific and the 
cultural/historical issues, and on the second morning several members admitted 
that they had not slept well, worrying that we would not be able to reach a 
consensus. But by the end of a long day, the miracle had happened: we had 
reached a unanimous agreement,&quot; Gingerich said.</p> 
<p>Although the seven-member committee has reached consensus, recent reports 
from the IAU convention in Prague say the astronomical community has not yet 
reached a consensus of their own.</p> 
<p>Reporting for Sky and Telescope magazine, Rick Fienberg described the 
raucous, Aug. 18 scene in Prague during the IAU assembly.</p> 
<p>&quot;All hell broke loose today as astronomers began openly debating the 
definition of planet.&quot; Fienberg reports.</p> 
<p>Fienberg described the scene as a borderline bar room brawl, when attendees 
argued whether planets should be defined by mass or roundness, or by external 
traits such as their orbital shape or the proximity to similar objects. 
According to Fienberg, the question of whether Pluto should be considered a 
planet, a controversy that has raged for years, emerged in the debate, and 
speakers went toe-to-toe to hammer their points home.</p> 
<p>In the end, Fienberg reports that about the only thing the astronomers 
could agree on was that they hated the word &quot;pluton.&quot;</p> 
<p>According to the IAU, the agency &quot;has been the arbiter of planetary 
and satellite nomenclature since its inception in 1919. And to that end, all 
2,500 attendees at the organization's general assembly in Prague will vote for 
or against the proposed planetary definition today.</p>
