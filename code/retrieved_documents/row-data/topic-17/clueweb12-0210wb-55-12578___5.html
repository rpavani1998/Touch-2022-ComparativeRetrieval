<p> </p> Cat brains are smaller than dog brains because cats are solitary 
animals and dogs are social animals. The social interaction between dogs over 
millions of years created this difference.<br>
<br>
It is said that cats have 
less sophisticated brains than dogs. The research was carried out by scientists 
at the University of Oxford. They also say that members of the dog family are 
good at problem solving - better than cats. I have not seen the original 
research document so the conclusions as written up in newspapers may not be 
completely accurate. This article is a bit of gossip about the conclusions of 
this study - my instant and biased thoughts, no more.<br>
<br>
The study begs 
some questions. We know that there are different types of intelligence. Pure 
problem solving is not the only kind. We don't hear of dogsforetelling the 
death of a hospital patient and then comforting the patient, for example. I am 
not sure if the study measured intelligence in a complete way and went beyond 
brain size and problem solving abilities.<br>
<br>
There is also the intriguing 
possibility that even if the research is accurate things will change over the 
next millions of years. The domestic cat is adaptable and now lives with and 
interacts with his or her human companion. The human is the most intelligent 
animal on the planet. Surely with millions of years of socialisation between 
cat and human the cat will become more intelligent.<br>
<br>
In millions of 
years time, it is quite possible to imagine human and cat finding a common 
language and communicating in a more complete and accurate way. If that 
happened things would dramatically speed up. Of course the dog should also 
become more intelligent but the dog takes commands unthinkingly. The domestic 
cat thinks about it and then does what he or she wants to do. Perhaps this 
attitude will develop into a more questioning approach from the cat and that 
too will speed up the development of the cat's brain.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
What I 
am saying in defence of the cat is that the study may have got things wrong and 
even if it is right the cat will catch up in time!<br>
<br>
It is also worth 
making the point that there is a fairly wide spectrum of intelligence between 
the cat breeds. The more active wildcat hybrids are known to be more 
intelligent than the passive, relatively uninquisitivePersians, for example. 
Did the study compare the brains of wild cat to wild dog or domestic cat and 
dog? There would seem to be a difference. The wild cat has to use its brain 
more than adomestic cat. This is what makes it more intelligent and the wildcat 
hybrids are more intelligent than the wholly domestic cat breeds and moggies. I 
would suspect that the wild cat is as intelligent as the wild dog and in any 
case we have to mention the lion.<br>
<br>
The lion lives in prides. It 
socialises with other lions. If, as stated, socialisation creates larger brains 
over millions of years, surely the lion must have the biggest brain of all the 
cats as it is the only cat that lives in groups except for feral cats who have 
adapted to this social way of life when there is a food source that feeds the 
group. However, I have seen nothing to support the notion that the lion is more 
intelligent than the solitary tiger. Indeed the general view is that thetiger 
fights smarter than the lion.<br>
<br>
For me, the study raises some questions 
but I suspect that the original research document addresses some of these. It 
is interesting to speculate nonetheless. One last interesting point, research 
indicates thatintelligent people prefer domestic cats to dogs. A million years 
of interaction with intelligent people will do the cat no harm in respect of 
brain size, I say.
