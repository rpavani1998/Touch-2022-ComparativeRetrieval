Sphynx cats &amp; kittens, older retired Chinese Crested adults and only two

to Europe, Canada and across the United States right out of Las Vegas.</p>

<h3>My Current Online Pick for Pet Food &amp; Supplies</h3> 
<p>Often I am asked where one can get Taste of the Wild dog food, Royal Canin 
Special 33 or other pet food products and supplies. I have to buy these 
products for my animals as well. Consequently, I review popular and specialty 
shops for dog food, cat food, and various goodies for our friends. We put some 
banners up on our site for places that I feel are reputable and offer 
reasonable prices. I figured let's just feature a standout here and you can go 
get what you need right now.</p> 
<p>Shop PetFood.com for everyday savings on your favorite top name brand pet 
foods. Quick, easy and delivered right to your door. And it gets better if you 
look at the promotion codes, deals on shipping and on line specials. I like 
them; their prices are good, usually have what I want in stock and provide 
pretty good customer service as well. That is why they are my current featured 
pick. It's worth givng them a look!</p> 
<h3>What Else</h3> <br>

<p>I continue to promote our lovely adoptable adults. I have made it easier to 
navigate the site to see these great pets. Both the Sphynx and Crested sections 
have an &quot;Adoptable Adults&quot; page on the left menu bar featuring our 
lovely juveniles, adults and older adults for your choosing. A couple of the 
animals listed have come to us from displaced families that could no longer 
have a pet. These are not rescues, rather they are good friends in need of a 
good home. Would that be your home?</p> 
<p>All of the adoptable adults are obviously cheaper in price, but are healthy 
and sure to make great family pets. They are wonderful animals socialized with 
other cats and dogs in our own home. Check them out and let me know what you 
think. They deserve a good home and that is exactly what we want to give them!
</p> 
<p>I really love our sphynx cats. They bring so much pleasure and comfort. We 
are tremendously happy for Marco and Sandal. Recently, we received a photo and 
email from Marco, &quot;Not a day goes by that I am not thankful for Sandal; 
what joy and peace he brings to life! We play hide and go seek, we watch birds 
and he is always friendly and happy when friends and family visit the home! He 
even sleeps with me like a teddy bear! What a joy! Many thanks for allowing me 
to give this wonderful testimonial!&quot; Go Marco and Sandal!</p> 
<p>We featured Dallas on our site for some time. She obviously was waiting for 
Carmela and Bear to come along and take her home. After adopting Dallas we 
received this great picture of Dallas and her new buddy, Bear, from Carmela; 
&quot;Wanted to send you an update on Dallas. She is doing great! She and Bear 
are getting along and having a ball playing together. They are almost exactly 
the same size, so they can tussle and roll and no one gets hurt. She is now 
sleeping in my bedroom at night next to Bear out of the crate! I am still 
crating during the day while I am gone until her heat is over, but anticipate 
that will end soon as well.&quot; My Dallas cheerleader, you go girl!</p> 
<p>Dallas is just one of our Chinese Crested Adoptable Adults. We also have 
Sphynx Adoptable Adults. For more information about our program or to make a 
great gift to someone and provide a great home for one of these animals, just 
call me. Your reward will be priceless!</p> 
<p>We just recently placed &quot;Lovie&quot; with Karen in Maryland. She is 
from our own Autmn-Argus Pepper. We are so happy for her. We always ask for 
pictures and updates just to be sure everyone is happy. Karen sent us these 
really great pictures and a real nice message, &quot;Just wanted to let you 
know that Lovie is doing really well and truly is growing like a weed. She has 
adapted to her new life and her 'sisters' very well. Here are some recent 
pictures I had taken of my three girls. The ones of the three L's are left to 
right, Loki's Kotickee Valhalla (my girl with the strange ear set), 
Autumn-Argus Love Charlie (when I have her AKC registered), and Kotickee's 
Luk-Kyi Lindzee. Thanks again for my beautiful little girl.&quot; You go Lovie 
and thanks so much Karen!</p> 
<p>In case you are new to our website and reside outside the USA, we welcome 
your visit, any pictures and comments, and we do limited shipments outside the 
continental United States. The requirements are quite a bit to deal with and 
when a client changes their mind or falls off the radar so-to-speak, it causes 
me to be stuck with an animal that is now older and more difficult to place. If 
you are overseas and wish one of our little friends, do as others have and look 
into an agent to pick up your animal from us here. Your agent can get all the 
tests, microships, quarantines and whatnot per your country requirements and 
ship your new friend as soon as it is possible. If that is not possible, then 
let's discuss your needs. I am older now and prefer concentrating on my animals 
here and will be happy to show anyone our selection, ship anywhere in the USA, 
but will help with shipments outside the USA on a limited basis!</p> 
<p>Keep caring for your animals and remember good health for our pets is our 
responsibility. Everyone loves to be loved. A pet is a comfort, a joy and a 
buddy forever. Consider what joy a new pet can bring into your life or that of 
someone you love. Call or email us now to bring happiness home!</p> 
<p>Thanks for all your support. I hope you continue to come back and enjoy our 
site and most especially, our animals. They are the stars of our show!</p>

<p>Often we are asked what we feed our dogs? We serve Taste of the Wild&reg; 
Brand Dog food with dramatic results. Made with real roasted meats and 
supplemented with fruits and vegetables, these grain-free formulas provide a 
superior taste sensation, highly digestible energy and natural antioxidants to 
support a healthy immune system and overall health. Sometimes we add raw egg or 
Nature's Variety Homestyle as a treat. Your pets crave a taste of the wild. Go 
ahead &mdash; give them one!</p>

option to save a bundle:</p> <br>

<h3>Feline Health</h3> 
<h4>Humane Alternatives to Declawing Cats</h4> 
<p>If you have any thoughts at all about the possibility of having your cat 
declawed, please consider these alternatives first. They really work to help 
prevent clawing damage to your possessions, as well as painful scratches 
&hellip;</p> <br>

<p>We definitely notice a healthy difference in our pets!</p> 
<p>The American public, as well as the Congress, has made it clear that wild 
horses on federal land are living symbols of the historic and pioneer spirit of 
the American West and must be protected.</p> <br>

<h3>Tell us what you think!</h3> 
<p>I truly enjoy receiving emails inquiring about our animals, giving updates 
and pictures of ones we placed, questions about health or comments you wish to 
share. Justemail me and I will answer quickly!</p> <br>

<p>&quot;I think I could turn and live with animals, they are so placid and 
self-contained, I stand and look at them long and long.&quot;<br>

<h3>Our Commitment</h3> 
<p>We will be very happy to make an appointment to show you our animals. Any 
animal we do place will be under a contract, with all shots and paperwork in 
order, complete with a health guarantee. We are ready to provide you with 
additional information uponrequest.</p> <br>

<h3>Acquiring a New Cat</h3> 
<h4>Getting off to a Purrfect Start with your new Cat</h4> 
<p>Congratulations on your new companion! To be at their best, cats have some 
basic needs; providing them will help ensure your cat's long-term health and 
welfare. If these needs are not met, your cat may feel stressed, which can 
affect both health and behavior. Cats seem to prefer having &hellip;</p> 
<h4>Sphynx Cats Information now on Catster.com</h4> 
<p>Show me the heat &mdash; that seems to be the theme song for the Sphynx 
breed. Because of their lack of a coat, they need to keep their bodies from 
losing heat. Let them snuggle with you under blankets and treat them to feline 
clothing to keep them feeling cozy &hellip;</p> <br>

<h3>Acquiring a New Dog</h3> 
<h4>Chinese Crested Dogs now on Dogster.com</h4> 
<p>Chinese Cresteds become very attached to their owners. They love lots of 
attention, affection and togetherness. Whether you're cooking, cleaning, 
reading or taking a bath, your Crested will be right there. Intensely curious 
and lively, they also love to play on the carpet, learn new tricks and explore 
the household. They get along especially well with children. If you're looking 
for a canine that loves to snuggle and cuddle, look no further &hellip;</p> 
<h4>Crate Training</h4> 
<p>Crate training uses a dog's natural instincts as a den animal. A wild dog's 
den is his home, a place to sleep, hide from danger, and raise a family. The 
crate becomes your dog's den, an ideal spot to snooze or take refuge during a 
thunderstorm. It's his own personal den where he can find comfort and solitude 
while you know he's safe and secure &mdash; and not shredding your house while 
you're out running errands. &hellip;</p> 
<h3>Equine Rights</h3> 
<h4>Go Mad! Help Save America's Wild Horses</h4> 
<p>The American public, as well as the Congress, has made it clear that wild 
horses on federal land are living symbols of the historic and pioneer spirit of 
the American West and must be protected. Although it is the government's 
obligation and duty to carry out this mandate, it is worthwhile to explore a 
public/private partnership to accomplish this goal. If we can together 
establish a plan for the permanent retirement and care of these magnificent 
animals, it will be a legacy that all Americans can be proud of. &hellip;</p> 
<br> 
<h3>Behavior &amp; Training</h3> 
<h4>Is It Okay to Spoil Your Cat and Pamper Your Pooch?</h4> 
<p>&quot;Where does Fido/Fluffy sleep?&quot; I typically ask this amongst a 
variety of other more health related questions about diet, supplements, 
exercise, etc. so the client is caught a bit off guard. I smile to myself when 
almost all of them sheepishly answer &quot;In my bed with me.&quot; Many new 
clients are hesitant at first to tell me how pampered their companions truly 
are, but once they get to know me, they begin to almost boast about it. I 
encourage &quot;spoiling&quot; companion animals &acirc;&#128;&#147; 
&quot;healthy spoiling&quot; that is &hellip;</p> 
<h4>Litter Box Training for Your Kitten</h4> 
<p>While it's true that most cats will instinctively use a litter box from the 
time they are young kittens, some basic knowledge about cats and litter boxes 
can help prevent problems from starting in the first place. And, as we all 
know, it's much easier to prevent a problem than to deal with it after &hellip;
</p> 
<h4>Housetraining</h4> 
<p>If your dog is going to live inside the home, and in America over 90% of 
our pets do, you are going to have to go through the housebreaking process. It 
is not hard, it need not be messy, and it need not be a struggle. It does not 
have to take a long time. Remember that housebreaking is a training issue 
&hellip;</p> 
<h3>Equine Health</h3> 
<h4>The Horse: Your Guide To Equine Health Care</h4> 
<p>The Horse is an award-winning monthly magazine devoted to equine health, 
care, management, and welfare; TheHorse.com is the award-winning website of The 
Horse magazine that contains all content from the magazine as well as 
additional news and features on horses and the equine industry. Our mission is 
to provide education to hands-on participants in the horse industry through 
print and electronic means. &hellip;</p> <br>
