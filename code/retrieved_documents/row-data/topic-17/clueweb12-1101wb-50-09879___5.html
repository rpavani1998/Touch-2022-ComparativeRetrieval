<p>my daughter and her dad drove to the other side of new zealand (botom of 
the south island) to get a fox terrier for my daughter. we called her lexi. she 
was a handful. she needs so much exercise! when my marriage broke up we sent 
her to her grandparents horse farm to live. she loves it up there. she plays 
with five other dogs. she never has to be tied up. i miss her but her life is 
perfect. i would love to adopt an older dog at christmas time. </p> </li>

<p>All of my cats have been adopted from shelters. They have become valuable 
members of my family, and we wouldn&rsquo;t know what to do without them. I 
don&rsquo;t know why some people prefer to buy from pet shops. My cats are very 
healthy. My first adopted cat is actually still with me after 10 years! I 
always have a tough time deciding which cat to adopt because I always wonder if 
the others will find happy homes. I&rsquo;m glad at least that my comment will 
help feed those animals who are still waiting for their forever homes.</p> </li>

<p>All my kitties are rescues. I guess you could call me a &ldquo;foster 
failure&rdquo;, &rsquo;cause I fall in love with them. Currently, I have Lucy, 
who is now the oldest (11), I have a brother and sister (Bob and Gwen) who were 
born on my patio to a feral mommy, and I have Punky, who was dumped into a 
feral colony a friend feeds. RIP to Snow, Dino, Buster, Emily and Ernie &ndash; 
all sweet, loving members of the family.</p> </li>

<p>My family and I adopted a beautiful Golden Retriever three years ago from 
our local shelter. She had been abused and was not socialized properly. She 
would not walk on a leash, play with toys, and was afraid of anyone that came 
near her. Today I am happy to report that she enjoys 3 mile walks, loves 
everyone that walks in the door, and will at least play fetch with a tennis 
ball. Please help rescue other animals like ours. A shelter pet may come with 
some baggage, but with time and love your family will reap the rewards.</p>

<p>My cat Saphir was a stray my sister found on the construction site she was 
working at &ndash; he was small enough to sit in the palm of my hand. 16 years 
&ndash; and lots of memories together &ndash; after, he is still with me, in 
spite of a diabetes that went undiagnosed for a while, he is doing splendidly 
now and I am hoping to have many more years with him!</p> </li>

<p>We adopted our first kitty from the Humane Society in Salem, OR in January, 
2000. Our Evita was picked up as a stray and was as skinny as can be. The H.S. 
guessed that she was 6 months old when we adopted her. Now, 10 years later, 
Evita is fat and as happy as can be. Interesting thing about fat former-stray 
cats. Our vet said that it really takes a toll on them, mentally. For the rest 
of their lives, they tend to eat as if it will be their last meal because 
living on the streets that is the reality. So sad I In 2001, Evita got a kitty 
sister ClaraBelle, who&rsquo;s Mama cat was a rescued stray when she was 
pregnant. The entire litter was adopted out and the rescuers kept the Mama.</p>

<p>Love love love my 3 rescued boys! Bodie joined the family by way of Beagles 
&amp; Buddies and was a former inmate at the Orange Cnty Animal Shelter. Miles, 
a Bluetick Beagle, came from the South Central Shelter with help from Ace of 
Hearts; Tex, a Lemon Beagle, from the North Central Shelter with help from Hope 
for Paws and Ace of Hearts. All amazing doggies with very different 
personalities &ndash; they make me laugh everyday. Heading to the Downey 
shelter this afternoon to spring another doggie with the help of Diamonds in 
the Ruff and taking her to a foster in Bakersfield tomorrow. Every year for my 
birthday I get to rescue a dog and the Downey pup is my bday &ldquo;gift&rdquo; 
for 2010. I, actually, plan to make it two this year with Harris from Harbor SO 
MANY great doggies need out of the shelters ASAP &ndash; please adopt from your 
local rescues and shelters or consider fostering if you can&rsquo;t adopt!</p>

<p>My dog (rest in peace Maggy) was adopted from the ASPCA in NYC. She 
provided me with 11 years of smiles. I also have had 8 cats so far and all of 
them were/are strays. I am addicted to reading about the rescued cats in my 
local paper each week. I could become a cat lady if not for my husband. Good 
luck and Happy Birthday!!!</p> </li>

<p>My two cats and dog were rescued from the streets. After putting out 
several posters on all 3 &ndash; no one ever claimed them. I was putting on 
free summer art classes for children and eventually because they knew that my 
pets came off the streets, they started telling me about animals they&rsquo;d 
found that were sick or had been harmed and insisted they come with me to help 
the ones they&rsquo;d found. This lead to the start of our animal rescue 
&ndash; we now rescue in rural areas, where so much goes on &ndash; unseen and 
un-noticed because it is rural. THANKS PET NEWS &amp; IAMS for all that you are 
doing!!!! xo<br>
 I thank my first 3 furbabies who gave me unconditional love, 
that inspired me to save as many as we can and teach children to help the 
innocent.</p> </li>

<p>All nine of my adult pets have been rescues, from shelters in Dallas and 
Irving, TX and St. Joseph, MO, or from the fields around my office. With 
Proposition B looming Nov. 2 in Missouri, we are fighting to educate the public 
about rescuing rather than buying from breeders. Thank you for donating food to 
shelter animals!!</p> </li>

<p>Those who love animals,love with a genuine affection that truly from the 
heart.Saving an animal proves that we are all sentient beings who care and 
relate to each other. Making a connection with another life other than human 
shows compassion and intellect.</p> </li>

<p>I am &ldquo;Mom&rdquo; to 4 cats and 2 dogs and love them all with heart 
and soul! The one I would like to introduce you to here is Francesca (aka 
&ldquo;Monkey&rdquo; due to the little ape-like sounds she makes when excited. 
&ldquo;ooohhh&hellip;.ahhh&hellip;. oooohhhh&hellip;ahhh&rdquo; (That last 
piece for those of you who appreciate &lsquo;sound&rsquo; along with your 
stories.) She, to the best of my knowledge, is half chow, half border collie. 
(This last breed inspiring her to make guests in my house sit down very 
quickly, less they be nipped gently on the bottom&hellip;)</p> 
<p>Anway, I adopted Francesca in Nashville from a shelter called &ldquo;Love 
at First Sight&rdquo; and the organization could not have more fittingly 
named&hellip; We met one day when I went in to visit the other 
&lsquo;occupants&rsquo; and was JUST on my way out when a gentleman walked in 
carrying her in his arms&hellip; all 3 pounds of her. She had been abandoned in 
a box and left on the side of the road. It&rsquo;s hard for me to even write 
that because such cruelty is almost impossible for me to understand. 
Nevertheless, this kind man had found her and already had 6 doggies at home so 
was unable to keep her. I also had a house full, but knew she was meant to be 
mine.</p> 
<p>She is now 11 years old and made a cross-country move to northern 
Washington state at the age of 2, where we still reside. She is still a bit 
mistrusting of anyone she doesn&rsquo;t know, but all in all a bundle of love. 
I&rsquo;m so happy we discovered each other that serendipitous day.</p> 
<p>Thanks to everyone who takes rescues into their homes and hearts.</p> </li>

<p>My most recent acquisition may be my most amazing. She&rsquo;s a cat named 
Phoenix who was set afire by her mentally ill children. She survived and was 
surrendered to the local shelter after her recovery. When I went to the 
shelter, I would see her and she would always reach out to me. It didn&rsquo;t 
take long for us to know we were meant to be together. She makes me laugh every 
single day. Love my little melted cat.</p> </li>

<p>I have a new baby! She was found on the streets almost two weeks ago 
&ndash; the teacher who found her posted pictures, notices around the blocks, 
and a notice at our brand new Animal Center. I took her this past Thurs and 
just love her! I named her Meg and she is a doll! My cat, Midnight, is also a 
rescue cat &ndash; she is a Hemmingway Cat, pure black and isn&rsquo;t too sure 
about sharing her house with another one. Here&rsquo;s to those who rescue!!</p>

<p>We adopted two cats this past August from the Michigan Human 
Society&rsquo;s Detroit shelter. We had planned on adopting once we were 
settled in our new house.</p> 
<p>We went to the shelter with the intention of adopting one cat. When we 
started to get familiar with him we were told that he and the cat he was 
sharing space with came into the shelter together and that when the staff tried 
putting them in separate cages they both cried ridiculously, so they put them 
back together. Of course, I didn&rsquo;t have the heart to separate them and 
the thought of what they would both go through if they were separated bothered 
me, so we came home with two cats instead of one. We&rsquo;ve learned over the 
last few months that we adopted a couple of characters!</p> </li>

<p>My dog Buddy was adopted from the city pound in Gallatin, TN he is 
lab/pyrenese mix aand was only 52 lbs when i adopted him he was sitting in the 
cage in the corner literally hiding from the male employees (they said he was 
left tied to a car bumper no food water or shelter)and had been beaten by a 
male. this guy was clearly not going to get another chance at life and LOVE 
unless i adpoted him i asked the employee to go out of sight so i could go into 
the kennell and see how he reacted to me well he came out with a smile so big 
and i could tell he had so much to give as so did i&hellip;..without hesitation 
i adopted him he is now a healthy weight happy and trusting dog with men as my 
boyfriend has spent the last year gaining his trust now they dance together 
Buddy gets on his hind ffet and it almost 5 and 1/2 feet tall he is almost as 
tall as me on his hidn legs will put his 2 front paws on your shoulders look at 
you with those big brown eyes and you can tell he is so greatful for a 2nd 
chance at love and life&hellip; I hope that they can get the maximum food 
donations to help these animals in shelters,, some are lucky to get out some 
arent&hellip;I love my BUDDY and so happy i stopped at the pound that day it 
changed my life forever&hellip;..love you big guy!</p> </li>

<p>Beatrice my Beagle got herself adopted. I was driving through Hannibal, 
Missouri with a friend and her young daughter when we decided to stop for lunch 
at a restaurant. When we came out this darling Beagle was sitting next to the 
car apparently waiting for us. She was clean with no parasites and seemed to 
have been just dropped by the car.</p> 
<p>I went inside to see if she belonged to anyone inside and was told she had 
been there for three days. After getting my friend&rsquo;s okay to put the 
Beagle in the backseat with her 8-year-old daughter I opened the door and in 
jumped Beatrice. During the conversation the daughter had named her. As we 
drove north to Iowa City we called every no-kill rescue we could think of 
looking for one where we were going.</p> 
<p>The upshot was that Beatrice started out as a foster dog and, well, never 
left. She fit right in with the other canines in the family. She&rsquo;s made 
all our lives better. And just because I opened the door and let her in.</p>

<p>My 11 year old 3/4 tiger/1/4 Siamese mix is from the CSRA Humane Society 
and is a wonderful pet. She is near me all of the time, and likes to frequently 
get on my shoulder and purr as she getss petted when I am at my computer each 
day. She is typically Siamese in hat she comments on everything we do!</p> 
<p>My 1 1/2 year old Cleopatra an orange and tiger mix with white legs and 
belly [Caliger] was rescued by my roommate on a pouring rainy day as cars were 
literally going over her in the middle of a busy intersection in 5 pm traffic. 
She was tiny, starving and had pneumonia, but immediately started eating and 
with good veterinary care has grown into a lovable, independent and very 
energetic cat who purrs much of the time! We generally call her Cleo, as her 
dignified moments are few and far between, but she is slowing down and letting 
us cuddle her more now as she approaches 2 years old.</p> 
<p>Cleo hardly ever meows, but lets out little trills of greeting when she 
sees us. But, when a cat jumped onto our outside window sill, she was hackles 
up and yowling and hissing and put on a wonderful display of territoriality on 
our inside window sill!</p> 
<p>Cleo is also special because she arrived a few days before we had to put my 
17 year old black Maine Coon Cat, Merlo, to sleep. She helped to ease our 
grieving for Merlo by watching her antics as she grew from a tiny kitten to 
adulthood.</p> 
<p>All of our cats that are now dead, had been adopted from shelters or were 
strays that we had adopted. We will always fondly remember Maggie and Merlo, 
Amber, Junior, Thomas Shaker, Thomasina Pipsqueak, Squeaker Cat and Sebastian 
whom I shared with my late sister, Annette. All were delightful cats that we 
will never forget.</p> 
<p>And, our late dog, Phoenix, was also a beloved pound dog who had 1 crippled 
leg, that never, ever slowed her down! She came to us from a Pet Smart Adoption 
Event and had been rescued from a abusive situation. She also was a good 
actress who would limp much worse than usual when she had to go to the 
vet&rsquo;s office or outside on a rainy day, but the limp vanished when she 
was ready to leave the vet&rsquo;s or was ready to come back into the house! 
Phoenix was a Chow/Shepherd/? mix who did not like getting wet, but who was 
wonderfully patient with our cats, who often played with her food by dropping 
dog chow pieces into her water bowl and then playing with them!</p> 
<p>When we get our next dog, he or she will be a pound dog, and I am sure that 
she or he will be as much fun and as loyal as Phoenix was.</p> </li>

<p>My son who has c.p. adopted a little dog from the Lake Elsinore Aniaml 
Shelter..LEAF. We made many visits to the shelter before we found the right 
dog. The workers knew us by name and knew that the right dog would someday come 
along. They told us just to be patient and wait for the right fit. Many 
handicapped peoples bff is their animal/s.</p> 
<p>We also have 2 cats 2 other dogs and two horses..all rescues. It seems like 
our animals know we rescued them when if the truth be told, they rescued us.</p>
<p>I hope the new animal shelter in Wildomar is able to save more animals and 
is ran better than ever. Good luck.</p> </li>

<p>I got my cat, Tess, at the shelter when she a little kitten. She arrived 
there alone, not part of a litter; she is a grey tiger with beautiful markings. 
She is now 6 years old and is a very unique, sweet cat; I can&rsquo;t imagine 
not having her! I love my Tess and if I were to get another cat, I would go the 
the shelter! But after all, cats pick their owners, they just let us think we 
pick them!</p> </li>

<p>We have had several adopted pets, all of whom were a great addition to our 
family! The cat with 7 kittens and the dog who graced us with his intelligence 
and loyalty. These are some of the most incredible animals we&rsquo;ve enjoyed. 
Strays who show up at our door we&rsquo;ve adopted so many I can&rsquo;t count, 
but they became as dear to us as any family member! Shelter animals in need of 
a forever home, are in abundance-they need our love and our help.</p> </li>

<p>Kalinka is a fantastic dobermann mix. When she was just a puppy, a scum 
riding a motorbike flung her away. She was collected by some nice passers by, 
my father was one of them. The puppy was shocked, but she was ok, nothing 
broken. It was a nice spring week end and I was having a day off with some 
friends who came to visit me from far away. My cell phone rung. It was my 
father telling me about the puppy. My week end out finished suddendly. I began 
to call whoever could offer her a place to stay while I was looking for an 
adoption. Of course, no reply LOL! My anxiety was growing and growing. Th day 
after I was able to find a place to take her to! I was so tired, bur relieved ! 
A couple of months later she was adopted by a nice girl who really loves 
animals. She is far from my place, so I never had the chance of visiting them, 
but I&rsquo;ll do sooner or later. In the meantime, we often call each other 
and she sends me pics of Kalinka.</p> </li>

<p>I have an adopted beagle; 6 year old little girl. I got her when she was 
three. She was dismissed from the Radnor Hunt, because unlike the rest of her 
family they said she was not a good hunter and would not hunt the rabbits. 
&hellip;&hellip;. and I just adore her, she is perfect in EVERY way!!</p> </li>

<p>We adopted a Border Collie mix puppy from Town Lake Animal Shelter 10 years 
ago. She had/has a sweet disposition and just wanted to be around others. Two 
years later, when I was pregnant with twins and on bedrest for preterm labor, 
my dog kept me company by sleeping near me every day and night for two 
tri-mesters. When the twins were born, she laid near their crib for two years 
before they transitioned into their own rooms. Now, she take turns sleeping 
with the kids at night. She has been the best dog and friend!</p> </li>

<p>All but one of our dogs and cats through the years have been rescues, 
either as &ldquo;wandered-up critters&rdquo; or as animals adopted though a 
rescue group. I&rsquo;d like to mention two.</p> 
<p>Sheva, a Great Dane, came to us in 2000. She was not abused, but she had 
been bought from a backyard breeder as a puppy by folks who realized they were 
overwhelmed and had made a mistake. We train our dogs for competitive AKC 
Obedience, and in 2003 Sheva went to the Great Dane National Specialty in 
Orlando and took High in Trial, the Obedience equivalent of Best in Show. We 
were excited to show that a rescue dog was every bit as good as the dogs with 
fancy pedigrees that dominate such shows.</p> 
<p>Gator is a Running Walker Hound, a variation on the Treeing Walker 
Coonhound. He arrived in rescue with two littermates as 4-month-old puppies 
full of buckshot. As best we can piece the story together the breeder 
couldn&rsquo;t sell the last five of a litter, and when it looked like she was 
stuck with them tied them to a tree and shot them with a shotgun. Two died, but 
she chickened out and dumped the three injured ones at a county shelter, from 
which they were pulled into rescue. All of these were terrified of people and 
loud noises, and only one was adoptable to a normal home. I volunteered at the 
rescue shelter, and over the years gained Gator&rsquo;s trust. At age four he 
came to live with us and is curled up behind me as I type this. He will never 
be &ldquo;normal&rdquo;, but he&rsquo;s happy here and he and Sheva are my best 
buddies.</p> 
<p>The rescue organization responsible for saving both of these dogs is Etosha 
Rescue and Adoption Center, in Seguin, Texas. Like all rescue groups, Etosha is 
forever in need of financial help. If you can help, tell them Gator sent you.

<p>I adopted a three-legged kitten, who was the victim of animal abuse. He is 
so loving and brings joy and laughter to our home every day. Please consider 
adopting from a shelter &lt;3</p> </li>

<p>I am a Foster for Chicagoland Eskie Rescue and Re-homing. So far this year 
my house has been the home of nine American Eskies while waiting for their 
adoptions. Fostering is a hard job because you fall in love with everyone of 
the fur-babies. Helping find homes for lots of animals each year is worth the 
heart brake. Try fostering.</p> </li>

<p>Not everyone realizes that a shelter pet is just as wonderful as one you 
buy from the pet store. We adopted Darby, our loving chocolate lab from the 
Monterey County shelter. She was in good hands before we found her there, but 
we were so happy to bring her home to our family. The staff was so friendly, 
and they take great care of the animals. I wish all shelters were like them. 
The sad truth is that shelters like theirs will always be in need of donations 
to be able to keep their doors, and hearts open.</p> </li>
