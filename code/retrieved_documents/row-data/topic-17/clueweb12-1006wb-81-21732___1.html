<br> Each morning, our dogs accompany us on our walk to the horse barn. My wife 
and I have shared our lives with many animals over our long and happy marriage, 
and our walk always makes me think of the dogs no longer with us, like our 
much-missed black Labrador, Sirloin.<br>
<br>
 While we would carry our cups of 
coffee, Sirloin usually carried a toy, a piece of a tree or something dead in 
his mouth. Once we got up to the barn, Sirloin would be ready to top off his 
tummy tank with some canine haute cuisine, diving head first into a fresh pile 
of horse dung. After cleansing his palate, he would then flop on his back, 
rolling fervently, as if he had a really bad itch and the horse apples were a 
bed of nails. Yes, we loved this dog.<br>
<br>

Does My Dog... Eat Poop? <br>
<br>
 The menu at our Cafe McMutts then, as now, 
featured dead mice, dead birds, assorted dung and the skeletal remains of 
various forest animals. These dietary indiscretions might freak out some 
people, but I've lived on a ranch my whole life, as has Teresa, and we think of 
them as kind of cute. Or we did, until the day Sirloin went too far in his 
journey to smell hell.<br>
<br>
<strong>Is That What I Think It Is?</strong> 
<br> Early one morning, I glanced out the kitchen window and noticed Sirloin 
gnawing on something black and furry. At first I thought it was just one of his 
toys, but then I walked out to investigate. As I approached, Sirloin abandoned 
his snack and raced over to greet me, wiggling with delight. He jumped up and 
gave me a wet kiss like a hormonally supercharged teenager. Though this type of 
greeting was routine, this time his breath was - shall we say? - revolting.<br>

<br> I knew the smell: skunk. <br>
<br>

Can Help You From Kissing First-Date Frogs <br>
<br>
 Sirloin retrieved his 
newest chew toy. It was a rotten skunk carcass teeming with maggots. Let me 
tell you, it was enough to turn even the cast-iron stomach of this veteran 
veterinarian. As I retreated in disgust, Sirloin followed me, with a thought 
bubble above his head that seemed to read, &quot;Aren't ya proud of me, Dad? 
Isn't this just the neatest thing I've ever brought home?&quot; Sirloin, of 
course, didn't think the dead skunk stunk; to him it was just another sample of 
Ken-nelle No. 5.<br>
<br>
 Though experts aren't sure why dogs like to roll in 
stinky stuff and eat rotten things, some believe that pets are marking 
themselves with their most prized possessions, guaranteed to impress all their 
two- and four-legged friends. It's like being a furry Fabio with a big gold 
chain and a shirt unbuttoned to below the rib cage. Wearing stinky stuff is 
like a designer label for pets.<br>
<br>
<strong>A Nose That Knows</strong> <br>
 Dogs not only have millions more scent receptors than humans do, they are also 
polar opposites from us when it comes to choosing scents that attract rather 
than repel. Though we like aromas that are fresh, floral and fragrant, our dogs 
prefer the dirty, dead and disgusting, or the rank, rancid and revolting. And 
just as my wife enjoys dabbing herself with a favorite perfume, Sirloin enjoyed 
dousing himself with his favorite fur-pume - in this case, skunk. Teresa puts 
on perfume to impress her friends; Sirloin loved his barnyard bouquet and, in 
much the same way, applied it to impress his friends, too.<br>
<br>
 To us it's 
disgusting - to them, it's divine. After thousands of years of evolution, dogs 
continue to go boldly where no man (or woman) has gone before on the journey to 
find the scent-sational. Ol' Sirloin never understood why I didn't appreciate 
his skunky prize that long-ago day. And he certainly never understood why the 
next thing I did was scrub him until only the memory of that stench remained.
<br> <br>
 And it does. Oh, yes, it does! <br>

<p>My son and his wife have a nine month old Pit Bull who sleeps in my bed. I 
frequently awaken to find the dog has carried their underpants into the bed to 
sleep with. Guess this is the dog's way of keeping us all together. After 
reading the story of Sirloin and his rotting, maggot-filled skunk carcass, 
those undies don't seem so bad after all.</p>
