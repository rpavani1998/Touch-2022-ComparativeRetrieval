<h3>What to Do When Your Dog Won&rsquo;t Listen</h3> Posted by Victoria 
Stilwell - 02/25/12 at 10:02:56 pm -7 Comments<br>

<p></p> 
<p>Dog owners often tell me that they can't get their dog to behave 
appropriately because the dog just won't listen to them.&nbsp; They claim that 
their dog is particularly unintelligent, but I consistently find that that is 
absolutely not the case.&nbsp; So how do you get Fido to pay attention?</p> 
<p>Punitive training techniques that center on gaining control of your dog by 
dominating her into obeying can damage the human/animal bond and cause your dog 
to mistrust you and essentially switch off.&nbsp; You want to 
&lsquo;matter&rsquo; to her by being the source of good things in her life, so 
that whenever you need her attention, she will give it to you.</p> 
<p>For so long people have been putting the emphasis on their dog&rsquo;s need 
to be &lsquo;obedient&rsquo; rather than &lsquo;cooperative.&rsquo;&nbsp; We 
issue &lsquo;commands&rsquo; rather than focusing on teaching the dog 
&lsquo;cues&rsquo; by attaching these cues to actions or behaviors that we want.
</p> 
<p>Motivating your dog to learn these cues by using rewards that make her feel 
good, will go a long way to getting the response you desire, even in the most 
distracting of environments.&nbsp; Any reward that is used to motivate your dog 
to learn should be of high value until she is responding reliably.&nbsp; When 
this has been achieved the high value reward can then be used intermittently.
</p> 
<p>Even though food treats are a really effective training tool, some dogs are 
motivated by other rewards such as toys, play, praise, or simply being 
touched.&nbsp; I have trained many dogs using many different types of 
rewards:&nbsp; a game of tug, a kind word, or a &lsquo;life reward&rsquo; such 
as asking the dog to sit before opening the door and then rewarding her for 
complying by going for a walk.</p> 
<p>I also like to vary rewards so that the dog never knows what is coming next 
or use what I call &lsquo;multi- motivators&rsquo; such as a food/ toy/praise 
combination for the desired response.</p> 
<p>Whatever you decide to do, a reward is going to make learning fun for your 
dog, improve her confidence and build up a strong bond between you. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;Remember the key to cooperation and compliance is trust and 
motivation and the more exciting and valued you are to your dog, the more she 
will listen to you in every situation.</p> <br>

<h3>TV Channel for Dogs Launches in San Diego</h3> Posted by Victoria Stilwell 
- 02/25/12 at 04:02:17 pm -1 Comment<br>

<p></p> 
<p>When she really puts her mind to it, my chocolate lab Sadie can whip up 
what I truly believe must be the most injured and woeful countenance any living 
being has ever forced another to look upon.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s not that she 
thinks I don&rsquo;t love her, or that she&rsquo;s in any physical pain.&nbsp; 
It&rsquo;s just that she honestly can&rsquo;t believe that I would ever even 
consider leaving her alone in the house, even though this dramatic ritual has 
played out multiple times every single day for the four years she&rsquo;s been 
a member of our family.</p> 
<p>This disastrous turn is, of course, mitigated somewhat by the utter and 
profound joy that she and her housemate &ndash; Chihuahua mix Jasmine &ndash; 
exude upon my inevitable return.&nbsp; As someone who has devoted my life to 
studying the behavior of dogs, I am nonetheless always amazed (and, let&rsquo;s 
face it - pleased) when I witness the manic scene of happiness and euphoria 
that occurs every time I return home, even if I&rsquo;ve only been out to pick 
up a few groceries.</p> 
<p>These moments of dread followed by glory are repeated millions of times a 
day around the world by pet owners who must go about their daily lives away 
from home, and while the cumulative result of this ritual is often nothing more 
than a temporary sadness, our repeated absences can also sometimes lead to 
acute separation anxiety, destructive boredom or other difficult-to-manage 
canine behaviors.</p> 
<p>A recent study revealed that over two-thirds of all American pet owners 
have left their TVs or radios on for their pets.&nbsp; &nbsp;The problem is 
that the television channels our pets end up watching or listening to often do 
more harm than good, because constant talk becomes an overpowering irritant, or 
the programming contains loud music or sounds interspersed with louder 
commercials, meaning the dog never receives an auditory break.</p> 
<p>So I was intrigued when I was asked to join the dynamic creative team 
behind DogTV &ndash; the first television channel specifically and 
scientifically designed to be watched by dogs.&nbsp; There have been several 
previous, relatively ill-fated attempts at creating video content for dogs, 
while companies like<em>Through A Dog&rsquo;s Ear</em> have successfully 
incorporated the concept of bio and psychoacoustics into audio-only products (I 
recently partnered with<em>Through A Dog&rsquo;s Ear</em> to create the 
groundbreaking newCanine Noise Phobia Series).</p> 
<p>What makes DogTV different, however, is its steadfast commitment to 
providing both an aural and visual environment which is tailored specifically 
to the needs of today&rsquo;s domesticated dog.&nbsp; The colors and 
frequencies of the visual and audio content on the channel are specially 
designed to resonate positively with our canine companions.&nbsp; Contrary to 
popular belief, dogs don&rsquo;t just see in black and white - yellows and 
blues can be easily distinguished unlike the colors green and red, which appear 
gray (part of the reason a dog can&rsquo;t always find that red rubber toy when 
it&rsquo;s laying on green grass).&nbsp; DogTV accounts for this and has 
recalibrated its video feed to suit dogs&rsquo; primary visual capabilities.</p>
<p>Another aspect of DogTV that helps break new ground is the fact that unlike 
other dog-targeted content, it does not simply attempt to calm the dog which 
might otherwise suffer from anxiety.&nbsp; Those of us in the field of animal 
behavior who are involved with DogTV (joining me on DogTV&rsquo;s advisory 
board is Dr. Nicholas Dodman,&nbsp; Veterinary Behaviorist and Program Head of 
the Animal Behavior Department of Clinical Sciences, Tuft&rsquo;s School of 
Veterinary Medicine, Boston) have helped to make sure that the channel&rsquo;s 
24/7 content follows certain timing rhythms.</p> 
<p>For example, instead of simply playing calming music and showing pictures 
of lulling oceans, DogTV&rsquo;s content also slowly introduces and alternates 
between more stimulating scenes from the dog&rsquo;s point of view.&nbsp; This 
ensures that throughout the several hours a lonely dog is home with DogTV on in 
the background, there are periods of subtly increased motion and tempo, 
resulting in a dog that is periodically and almost imperceptibly stimulated, 
helping to minimize the boredom which can often result in destructive behavior. 
This content is also interspersed with periods of &lsquo;exposure&rsquo; where 
dogs might hear, for example, the distant sound of a vacuum cleaner played at 
very low levels, providing gradual exposure which effectively desensitizes dogs 
to everyday domestic environmental sounds, preventing noise sensitivities and 
phobias from ever occurring.</p> 
<p>Several early, anecdotal reviews from its recent launch in San Diego have 
mentioned that after turning DogTV on for a few minutes, the reviewer&rsquo;s 
dogs didn&rsquo;t seem interested in the channel and wandered off, apparently 
unimpressed.&nbsp; Unfortunately, this is another example of why the imposition 
of our human sensibilities on our dogs does not always translate 
successfully.&nbsp; DogTV is not designed to be &lsquo;must see TV&rsquo; for 
our dogs, and it&rsquo;s perfectly ok for dogs not to want to become couch 
&lsquo;pet&rsquo;atoes once it&rsquo;s switched on.&nbsp; To the contrary, the 
real value in DogTV can be found in those long hours when we are not around and 
our dogs are otherwise either completely understimulated or suffering from 
separation distress.&nbsp; As I&rsquo;ve stated on several news outlets 
following the channel&rsquo;s initial launch, DogTV should be viewed only as 
one (very valuable) tool in our arsenal to help enrich our dogs&rsquo; overall 
domestic experience and should not replace a dog&rsquo;s daily need for 
exercise.</p> 
<p>If used correctly, I believe DogTV will be a valuable tool to help ease our 
dogs&rsquo; loneliness and provide comfort on separation.&nbsp; We advise that 
all pet parents, before they leave their dogs alone with DogTV,&nbsp; take time 
to watch the content with their dog for short periods over a couple of days or 
have the channel on in the background when they are home with their dogs.&nbsp; 
This will ensure that every dog&rsquo;s reaction to the content can be 
gauged.&nbsp; It is not DogTV&rsquo;s aim to produce a nation of dogs that bark 
at the television when their owners are away.&nbsp; Moreover introducing the 
channel to a dog when an owner is present will help provide a positive 
association between the content and the comfort that the person&rsquo;s 
presence provides, making it easier for a dog to cope when their owner leaves.
</p> 
<p>DogTV is currently only available on TimeWarner and Cox Cable in the San 
Diego area, but a full, nationwide launch is expected soon, followed by other 
countries including the UK and beyond.&nbsp; For more information go to

<h3>What&rsquo;s In a Name</h3> Posted by Victoria Stilwell - 01/19/12 at 
08:01:25 am -31 Comments<br>

<p></p> 
<p>There are many different terms used to describe dog behavior and training 
methods and so much confusion as to what they actually mean.&nbsp;&nbsp; I 
posted a few already this week onmy Facebook page and asked for your 
comments.&nbsp;&nbsp; The feedback was really interesting and showed how these 
terms can be interpreted in such a broad way.&nbsp;&nbsp; I also asked what you 
would like to discuss in future posts and received some great ideas for topics 
so these will definitely be covered in the weeks ahead.&nbsp;&nbsp; For now 
though, what does the term, &lsquo;dominance,&rsquo; mean to you in terms of 
describing canine behavior and how does it impact the way we teach them?&nbsp; 
Does dominance exist in the canine world and does a human really have to 
establish dominance over a dog in order to get him/her to behave as old school 
theory would have us believe?&nbsp; I pick these terms knowing that they are 
highly controversial and spark vigorous debate but I think it is important to 
correctly define them.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you join the discussion please keep it 
civil.</p> <br>

<h3>Positively Parliamentary!</h3> Posted by Victoria Stilwell - 01/11/12 at 
09:01:42 pm -3 Comments<br>

<p></p> 
<p>At the beginning of December I went to England for a seminar and series of 
meetings.&nbsp;&nbsp; As much as I love living in the States I also miss my 
mother country, so going back is always a treat, even if it is for 
work.&nbsp;&nbsp; During my last visit I was invited by my friend and UK 
television vet, Marc Abraham, to attend a meeting of The Associate 
Parliamentary Group for Animal Welfare (APGAW) at the Houses of Parliament, the 
seat of British government.</p> 
<p>APGAW is an all-party group made up of MPs, Peers and associate animal 
welfare organisations or groups. According to its mission statement, &ldquo;The 
aim of the group is to promote and further the case of animal welfare by all 
means available to the Parliaments at Westminster and in Europe. APGAW seeks to 
influence the development and introduction of effective wide-ranging 
legislation to improve welfare and also acts as a discussion forum of 
politicians and welfare experts to looks at areas of concern.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Now, if you have ever watched a parliamentary debate you will know that 
British politicians get pretty feisty with each other. Before the meeting, I 
had a chance to witness a debate about the future of the British economy and 
what steps were being taken to revive a struggling situation. &nbsp;As you can 
imagine, the debate got very heated with both political parties throwing scorn 
and derision at each other &ndash; very entertaining to watch even if it was on 
such a serious topic. &nbsp;The public gallery looks right over the great room 
with a bullet proof glass window separating the public from the 
politicians.&nbsp; All bags and any electronics are removed from your person 
before being seated in the gallery.&nbsp; The public is also made to sign a 
piece of paper stating that they will not cause any disruption while in the 
gallery.&nbsp; I dared not make a sound!</p> 
<p>The Houses of Parliament and the House of Lords fascinated me, but the part 
that impressed me most was Westminster Hall, once a royal palace and the seat 
of government for hundreds of years.&nbsp; It was remarkable to think that I 
was walking in the footsteps of kings, queens and prime ministers who had come 
before me.&nbsp; The hall itself, which is the oldest part of the Parliament 
estate, was built in 1097 and is spectacular by its sheer size, with an 
enormous wooden vaulted ceiling that soars high above you.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Victoria and Mark Abraham</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>The Houses of Parliament is like a rabbit warren, containing hundreds of 
smaller meeting rooms as well as numerous rooms where daily receptions are 
held. &nbsp;APGAW had invited the main players in the dog world to hear what 
progress had been made in the three years since the airing of<em>Pedigree Dogs 
Exposed</em>, a hard hitting documentary by Jemima Harrison of Passionate 
Productions.&nbsp; PDE &lsquo;lifted the lid on the extent of health and 
welfare problems in pedigree dogs,&rsquo; and provided a general overview about 
what was being done to improve breeding practices and standards in the UK.</p> 
<p>The major institutions were in attendance including The Dogs Trust and the 
RSPCA, but the Kennel Club was noticeably absent.&nbsp; Since the meeting was 
being filmed by Jemima Harrison for<em>Pedigree Dogs Exposed 2</em> , the KC 
had refused to attend because it did not trust Passionate Productions &lsquo;to 
provide an unbiased account of proceedings.&rsquo; &nbsp;&nbsp;The meeting was 
civil and positive, but it was clear that even though a lot of progress had 
been made, including work by the Kennel Club itself, they had to be more 
aggressive with implementing the changes.&nbsp; If you haven&rsquo;t yet seen
<em>Pedigree Dogs Exposed</em>, you should take time to watch it.&nbsp; The 
issues addressed in the documentary don&rsquo;t only affect dogs in 
Britain.&nbsp; The American Kennel Club is just as guilty for setting breed 
standards that sometimes compromise the health and well- being of many breeds 
of dogs.&nbsp; It seems &lsquo;beauty&rsquo; has taken over from common sense 
and the way a dog looks is more important than how it feels.&nbsp; Take a look 
at the film and judge for yourself.</p> 
<p>As this is a very sensitive issue for many people, I have gotten a few 
emails and questions from proponents of purebred dogs who are convinced that 
because I support campaigns like theRSPCA&rsquo;s <em>Born to Suffer</em>, I 
must therefore also be against dog shows and the purebred culture.&nbsp; I am 
not, and I dismiss those who suggest that wanting the best for our canine 
companions&rsquo; mental and physical health is necessarily at odds with the 
breeding of purebred dogs.&nbsp; I have a purebred Chocolate Lab (although she 
was a rescue) as well as a mutt (Chihuahua/Terrier mix).&nbsp; While I 
personally am not into showing dogs, I have no problem with those that love it, 
provided that they maintain a healthy balance between their own desire to show 
and their dogs&rsquo; happiness and health.&nbsp; All I ask is that we all take 
a second look at what some of the current breed standards set by the 
&lsquo;governing bodies&rsquo; are doing to our dogs and take action to reverse 
any of the negative effects.&nbsp; I really can&rsquo;t see how anyone could 
argue against that.</p> 
<p>After all, are dogs only here for our sake, or should we think of 
what&rsquo;s best for them as well?</p> <br>

<h3>Victoria Talks With Steve Dale</h3> Posted by Victoria Stilwell - 01/11/12 
at 09:01:25 pm -No Comments<br>

<p></p> 
<p><strong><em>Victoria Stilwell:&nbsp; Hey Steve! We last met up at American 
Humane Association&rsquo;s Hero Dog Awards in L.A. &ndash; What have you been 
up to since then?</em></strong><br>
 Steve Dale:&nbsp; I emceed an American 
Humane Association animal assisted therapy dinner, celebrating the work of many 
dogs and their volunteer handlers in Denver.</p> 
<p>I&rsquo;ve contributed to a couple of books, with Dr. Robin Ganzert, 
president/CEO of the American Humane Association I wrote the Foreword to 
&ldquo;Animals and the Kids Who Love Them,&rdquo; by Allen and Linda Anderson; 
and contributed to &ldquo;Raising My Furry Children,&rdquo; by Tracy Ahrens.</p>
<p>Best of all was contributing to &ldquo;The Cat: Clinical Medicine and 
Management,&rdquo; edited by the amazing Dr. Susan Little, and written by a 
long list of the most noted feline veterinarians on the planet. It was humbling 
to have been asked to contribute, and included among this extraordinary group. 
And this book is ginormous &ndash; it&rsquo;s 1,400 pages. You don&rsquo;t need 
to join a health club, just carry this around for a workout.</p> 
<p>I am also busy assisting with a very important book &ndash; having to do 
specifically with dog behavior &ndash; but I am not yet allowed to say much 
about it. I can tell you &ndash; and I am telling you first &ndash; I 
haven&rsquo;t even mentioned this on my radio shows or anywhere, except to my 
wife and my mom. So, you are right there with mom in getting the scoop.</p> 
<p>I will apparently be honored in February at the Dog Writer&rsquo;s 
Association of America awards banquet, inducted into the DWAA Hall of Fame. I 
will be the youngest inductee ever. Really, I&rsquo;m not sure this happened or 
how do deserve this &ndash; and I have so much else to achieve.&nbsp; So, 
I&rsquo;m not sure I&rsquo;m ready. Although in three interviews in the past 
three weeks, I&rsquo;ve been called &ldquo;legendary.&rdquo; I swear &ndash; I 
AM NOT THAT OLD, or legendary.</p> 
<p>And this is also crazy, came back to a meeting with my newspaper syndicator 
of 17 years, Tribune Media Services. They expressed interest in publishing 
ebooks. I am their great experiment to determine if this works, not only if 
there is interest in the pet genre, but is this financially viable? It&rsquo;s 
like I have a Great Dane on my shoulders, lots of pressure on my back.</p> 
<p><strong><em>VS:&nbsp; Tell us about &ldquo;Good Dog!&rdquo; and &ldquo;Good 
Cat!&rdquo; &ndash; what kind of info can our readers expect to find in them?
</em></strong><br>
 Yes, those are the two ebooks. We decided to take a sort of 
best of my newspaper Q &amp; A columns from the past three or four years, one 
book features questions about dogs, and a second book is all about cats. They 
are commonly asked and answered behavior questions/answers, and some which are 
totally fun &ndash; real questions that you won&rsquo;t believe. For example, a 
cat who paws at the TV whenever and only when Justin Beiber is on.</p> 
<p>I answer, &ldquo;This cat has a new illness: Cat scratch Beiber.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Sometimes I answer the questions. Sometimes, I seek out experts like 
&ndash; well, Victoria Stilwell, for example. Lots and lots of veterinary 
behaviorists, some certified applied animal behaviorists, IAABC certified dog 
and cat behavior consultants answer questions and so do some of the top dog 
trainers, all are APDT. I am proud that truly I have a large contingent of 
world renown experts who are quoted here.</p> 
<p>Can you imagine? For 17 years, I&rsquo;ve had the same terrific editor at 
TMS (Stacy Deibler) and for nearly that long, each and every column I write I 
have a veterinarian review to be certain of medical accuracy. Dr. Sheldon 
Rubin&rsquo;s eyes must be tired &ndash; but who better to write the 
introduction for both books?</p> 
<p><strong><em>VS:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How did you get Betty White 
to write the Prologue &ndash; I&rsquo;m thinking she&rsquo;s pretty busy.</em>
</strong><br>
 SD:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I believe if you combine my 
schedule and yours &ndash; we don&rsquo;t equal Betty White&rsquo;s. 
She&rsquo;s always been very kind to me. And I adore her&hellip;.I&rsquo;m 
thinkin&rsquo; I&rsquo;m not alone there. She really does walk the walk when it 
comes to animal welfare. And I&rsquo;ve known her for some time. Years ago, she 
served on the Board of Directors of the American Humane Association, where for 
the past several years I&rsquo;ve served. She has been a Trustee with the 
Morris Animal Foundation for nearly 50 years. Can you believe a half a Century? 
She&rsquo;s an amazing lady. And she knows I care about Morris, and serve on 
one of their advisory committees, and whenever they call on me &ndash; I say 
&lsquo;yes.&rdquo; So she said, &lsquo;yes.&rsquo;</p> 
<p>But I am equally as thrilled to have my old friend Pam Johnson-Bennett 
write the foreword to &ldquo;Good Cat!&rdquo; She&rsquo;s the<em>you</em> of 
the cat world. And then, to have you write the foreword of the dog book, I am 
still howling with joy.</p> 
<p>You should know, the first time I saw you on TV I thought, 
&lsquo;WOW!&rsquo; Not only do we need this approach, we need it now! Too many 
were then and may still be joining the aversive or let&rsquo;s be dominant 
bandwagon. Thank you for your contribution to this book, and for dogs, in 
general.</p> 
<p><strong><em>VS:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Are these books designed for 
experienced pet owners, are they ideal for new pet parents, or everyone in 
between?</em></strong><br>
 SD:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Everyone, from 
granny to little kids. The names of these books are no accident. I actually 
didn&rsquo;t come up with them &ndash; but the story is very cool. After 
reading through the content Sarah Bright at Tribune Media Services said, 
&ldquo;Your books are all about the positive, encouraging pets.&rdquo; And she 
thought of the titles &ldquo;Good Dog!&rdquo; and &ldquo;Good Cat!&rdquo;</p> 
<p><strong>VS:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>If there is one message from 
the books, what might that be?</em></strong><br>
 
SD:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t assume the problem is behavior 
&ndash; especially if it&rsquo;s new. So if you have say a dog who you know is 
house trained and then begins to have accidents &ndash; see the veterinarian! 
The problem might well be medical &ndash; so no amount of behavior modification 
will help.</p> 
<p><strong>VS:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>&ldquo;Good Dog!&rdquo; is 
dedicated to Lucy &ndash; tell us about her.</em></strong><br>
 
SD:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I had the pleasure, honor of knowing Lucille 
Ball some. Lucy, our miniature Australian Shepherd was named for her. It turned 
out that &ndash; except for the red hair &ndash; our Lucy lived up to her 
namesake. Actually more than her namesake. Lucy was dog was very funny &ndash; 
which I will tell you about. Lucy, the actress, in person, was a very serious 
and task minded person. She loved her craft. Of course, she helped to create 
it&nbsp; There&rsquo;s so much Lucy trivia.</p> 
<p>Here&rsquo;s an example, and I bet most people don&rsquo;t know 
this&hellip;.Lucille Ball once told me that watching other sitcoms was kind of 
bittersweet for her. It&rsquo;s because she&rsquo;d hear her mother&rsquo;s 
laugh.&nbsp; Her mom never missed an &ldquo;I Love Lucy&rdquo; taping. &ldquo;I 
Love Lucy&rdquo; was taped in front of a live audience, long before canned 
laughter or &ldquo;sweetening&rdquo; sitcoms with laughs ever existed. 
Beginning in 1970&rsquo;s, most TV sitcoms began to depend on laugh tracks or 
at least &ldquo;sweetening&rdquo; them with taped laughs. Those taped laughs 
are actually lifted from &ldquo;I Love Lucy.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>So for many years before she passed on, Lucy would turn on a sitcom at home 
and hear her mother&rsquo;s unmistakable laugh.</p> 
<p><strong>VS:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>How would you ever get to 
meet Lucille Ball? And what other celebrities have you met?</em></strong><br>
 
SD:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I started off as a radio deejay, but also 
writing for newspapers,<em>USA Today</em> and and <em>People</em> magazine 
&ndash; and I often was the guy interviewing celebrities. I&rsquo;d ask 
celebrities about their pets of course. I was the first to write about 
Oprah&rsquo;s dogs in<em>People</em> magazine. As for the other celebrities, 
really the list is far too long. But I will say, Oprah really cares about 
animals &ndash; and you and I should be on her show together, I think. I was 
once her show &ndash; that was a career highlight. Oh, other celebs- too many 
to list, and it was so long ago. I was in awe of many, Jimmy Stewart, who would 
be? We actually spoke about his trips to Africa, and elephant poaching. And I 
interviewed both of the Darren Stevens from &ldquo;Bewitched.&rdquo; I 
don&rsquo;t know - too long a list. I&rsquo;ve met Benji and Lassie (though not 
the originals).</p> 
<p><strong><em>VS:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; About Lucy the dog?</em>
</strong><br>
 SD:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ahhh yes. She was amazing. For 
most dogs &ndash; her included &ndash; animal assisted therapy is work. She 
went to the famous Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago, and saw clients ranging 
from children with severe burns to teenage gun shot victims to older people 
rehabbing from strokes. She made everyone smile, no matter it was.</p> 
<p>Each week as soon as walked into the room, Lucy would go 
&ldquo;Whahooo!&rdquo; And everyone would laugh. I was always embarrassed 
&ndash; but we were there to make people laugh, and I admit it was cute. But 
she wasn&rsquo;t supposed to do that. What could I do? I suppose I could have 
trained an alternative behavior &ndash; but people so loved it.</p> 
<p>Then after meeting in this large room, we were always paired with someone. 
There are so many stories &ndash; and anyone who does animal assisted therapy 
has so many stories.</p> 
<p>There was this one man &ndash; apparently suffered brain damage in some 
sort of accident. He just spoke gibberish. His family mostly didn&rsquo;t 
understand. He was paired off with Lucy because the therapist was simply hoping 
for him to laugh, and our dog would often find a way to make that happen with 
previous clients.</p> 
<p>On this occasion, much more occurred. I don&rsquo;t know why &ndash; and it 
really might have backfired. I asked him to ask Lucy to &ldquo;sit.&rdquo; He 
looked at me like, &lsquo;Really, you&rsquo;ve gotta be kidding.&rdquo; He 
hesitated, but decided to give it a try. He said something &ndash; but it 
didn&rsquo;t sound like the word sit or any word. Lucy instantly sat.</p> 
<p>I have no idea how that happened. He didn&rsquo;t offer any hand movements. 
Maybe Lucy heard me say the word. We did often play this game where I&rsquo;d 
ask little kids &ndash; very young kids &ndash; to ask Lucy &ldquo;sit.&rdquo; 
I&rsquo;d then offer a hand signal to insure compliance. The little kids would 
never see the hand signal. And they loved it, of course. So, maybe Lucy just 
did it this time without the hand signal. Or maybe in within his gibberish, 
Lucy somehow made out the word.</p> 
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter how she did it, This man&rsquo;s family walked off 
&ndash; and began to hug one another, all in tears. They didn&rsquo;t want the 
man in the wheelchair to see. But he did, and he too began to well up with 
tears. He then said &ldquo;Thank you&rdquo; to Lucy. We all understood. His 
first speakable words since his injury were to Lucy.</p> 
<p>If only she could have known the difference she made in so many lives. When 
she passed away in 2011, we began a fund with the American Humane 
Association&rsquo;s Hero Dog Awards to support animal assisted therapy.</p> 
<p><strong><em>VS:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who else did you dedicate the 
cat book to?</em></strong><br>
 SD:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I had a dog 
named Chaser, who changed my life. And Lucy and I were definitely close &ndash; 
but it&rsquo;s Ricky who I miss the most. His impact on cats in life and death, 
undeniable.</p> 
<p>Here&rsquo;s the story. Seeking to find some new and different routines for 
Lucy to do in animal assisted therapy, my wife, Robin, asked me to train her to 
do something out of the ordinary. Don&rsquo;t ask my why &ndash; but I thought 
I&rsquo;d train Lucy to play a little kids piano. After all, that is out of the 
ordinary.&nbsp; I closed of the door to the room I was training her in &ndash; 
or thought I did &ndash; so other pets wouldn&rsquo;t walk into our training 
session.</p> 
<p>However, just a few minutes into the piano class, Ricky, our Devon Rex cat 
pushed the door open.&nbsp; Ricky looked at me, and then looked at the piano. 
He instantly lifted his front left paw, and gently tapped the keyboard. And he 
did it again, and again. By gosh &ndash; he was playing a tune. Clearly I had a 
musical prodigy. Already well socialized, Ricky was happy going places with us, 
often hanging out on my shoulder on a leash and harness. We&rsquo;d visit the 
pet store, a neighborhood video store - in those days, they still existed, the 
bank or the dry cleaner.</p> 
<p>I had always wanted to demonstrate that cats <em>can</em> learn. And Ricky 
was such an apt pupil, I knew I had my opportunity. I also taught Ricky lots of 
other behaviors &ndash; including jumping over our dogs - when they were on a 
&lsquo;down/stay&rsquo; - , jumping over little kids (also on a 
&lsquo;down/stay&rsquo; -, and jumping through a Hoola hoop.</p> 
<p>At one point in her life, she was trained to jump on to my shoulder to 
&ldquo;ask&rdquo; for his heart medication. It&rsquo;s too bad that this was 
all before the days of YouTube. Ricky most certainly would have gone viral many 
times. Still he was a TV and radio attraction, appearing on several national TV 
shows including programs on Animal Planet as well as &ldquo;National Geographic 
Explorer,&rdquo; and lots of Chicago TV and radio show. He even performed 
recitals at local pet stores.</p> 
<p>Ricky and I worked together to reach millions to dispel myths about cats.
</p> 
<p>Training cats has lots of benefits, aside from impressing friends with 
YouTube videos. When you work closely with an animal, your bond might be 
intensified. Today more cats are given up to shelters than dogs. It seems when 
dogs have behavior problems people are more willing to go the extra mile. Maybe 
with people interacting more often with their cats, this will change.</p> 
<p>Also, the more you know an individual animal, the more you pay attention to 
what&rsquo;s &ldquo;normal.&rdquo; Cats are such great actors; they&rsquo;re 
incredibly adept at masking illness. So, perhaps people who have that more 
intense relationship with more quickly notice their cat isn&rsquo;t quite 
right. And then, actually do something about it with a veterinary visit.</p> 
<p>We know that people and dogs who learn throughout life might be less at 
risk for suffering cognitive problems in their Golden years &ndash; and 
it&rsquo;s presumed the same is true for cats.</p> 
<p>And a lifetime of learning new things might allow cats &ndash; who by 
nature are typically entrenched in routines - to become a bit more pliable and 
open to inevitable changes.</p> 
<p><strong><em>VS:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How did Ricky pass away?</em>
</strong><br>
 SD:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, at about 3 years of age 
or so, Ricky, who seemed perfectly healthy &ndash; was diagnosed with feline 
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). This heart disease is probably the most 
common cause of death of indoor cats from post kitten until about 9 or 10 years 
when diseases of older cats become more prominent. Sometimes cats with HCM live 
out normal lives, and never have an idea they are supposed to be sick.</p> 
<p>However, mostly these cats either throw several clots before finally dying 
or being euthanized, or like Ricky &ndash; one day &ndash; just drop. There is 
currently no effective treatment.</p> 
<p>I am proud that shortly after Ricky&rsquo;s death in 2002, I began the 
Ricky Fund &ndash; so more might me learned about HCM in cats, even hopefully 
to find a treatment. And in fact, as a direct result of the money we raised 
&ndash; at this point over $100,000 - for two breeds &ndash; the Maine Coon and 
Ragdoll &ndash; there is now a genetic test to determine if the gene defect for 
HCM is carried by individual cats. The hope is that breeders won&rsquo;t breed 
those individuals. While the test is making a difference for those breeds, we 
need to do more to help all cats. Learn more at
http://www.winnfelinehealth.org/rickyfund.html.</p> 
<p><strong><em>VS:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is that what you&rsquo;re 
most proud of?</em></strong><br>
 SD:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, I 
don&rsquo;t know &ndash; everything from defeating public officials seeking 
breed bans to being a part of the story of creating dog friendly areas or dog 
parks in Chicago &ndash; and there&rsquo;s so much more&hellip;.but I guess 
right now the answer is Mary and Honey.</p> 
<p><strong>VS:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Who are Mary and Honey?</em>
</strong><br>
 SD:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many wrote me about her cat 
Honey missing the litter box. I was able to help via my newspaper column, 
though sometimes it&rsquo;s listeners to the radio show or when I do TV. And 
knowing I helped a cat and a family. It&rsquo;s the emails and letters and 
phone calls on the radio indicating my advice saved a life that really matters.
</p> 
<p><strong>VS:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Is that the greatest 
compliment?</em></strong><br>
 SD:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Could be 
&ndash; or that I&rsquo;m responsible for sending more pets to the veterinary 
clinic than anyone America. Because I know in at least some of those visits, 
the veterinarian saved a life. I know Victoria Stilwell, now that&rsquo;s a 
nice compliment too!</p> 
<p><strong>VS:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Where can people buy the 
ebooks?</em></strong><br>
 SD:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wherever ebooks 
are sold. The ebooks are $2.99, except for the enhanced version of &ldquo;Good 
Dog!&rdquo; available for the IPad through Itunes, that&rsquo;s $4.99. The 
enhanced version contains imbedded videos, so not only do I write about how to 
solve some behavior problems, I show people how to do it. It&rsquo;s kind of 
like what you do &ndash; but I don&rsquo;t wear the high boots and my accent is 
form Chicago.</p> <br>

<h3>Pets Add Life!</h3> Posted by Victoria Stilwell - 12/06/11 at 09:12:03 pm -

<p></p> 
<p>The Christmas Puppy.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ve all heard it before, and most of us 
know someone who has actually done it.&nbsp; Despite the best efforts of humane 
societies and shelters around the world, the holiday season is still among the 
busiest times of the year in terms of people adding new pets to their 
household.&nbsp; And regardless of where people get their cuddly new friend, 
the sad fact is that January and February are often the busiest time of year 
for shelters taking back recently-adopted pets whose honeymoon period with 
their new owners has ended just as the holiday decorations are packed away for 
another year.</p> 
<p>If you&rsquo;re considering adding a pet to your life over the holidays, 
please make sure you&rsquo;re not just caught up in the festivities and 
optimism that comes with the holiday season and the impending new year.&nbsp; 
But for those who are intent on bringing a new furry friend into the fold, I 
thought now would be a good time to discuss this age old question:&nbsp; When 
is the right time to add a new pet to the family?</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>My beautiful, brown Sadie.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Dogs are pack animals and don&rsquo;t do well in social isolation so I 
often wondered when I got my Labrador Sadie if she was happy being an only 
dog.&nbsp;&nbsp; I knew that she loved being with my family and me and thrived 
on the attention we gave her but she always looked so sad when we left her at 
home by herself that I worried about her being lonely. &nbsp;She was not highly 
social with other dogs but once she got to know them she seemed happy enough in 
their company.&nbsp; &nbsp;When I introduced Sadie into the home we also had a 
cat, Angelica, and even though the two tolerated each other, it wasn&rsquo;t 
exactly a match made in heaven.</p> 
<p>I was often asked if I thought it was alright to have just one dog and 
would always answer that as long as the only dog was given plenty of human 
attention and stimulation and not left on their own for long hours during the 
day, it was ok.&nbsp; I still believe this is the case, but the question always 
made me wonder if I was doing the right thing.&nbsp; If I did bring another dog 
into the home I wanted to make sure that I was doing it for the right reasons 
and not because I felt guilty. &nbsp;&nbsp;I also knew that introducing a dog 
into the household had been a little stressful for my cat to begin with, and 
even though she relaxed pretty quickly in Sadie&rsquo;s presence, I 
didn&rsquo;t want to put her through any more stress by adding another dog into 
the mix.</p> 
<p>My work introduces me to a lot of families that have multi-dog households 
so that their dogs have playmates.&nbsp; I also meet a lot of people that 
&lsquo;collect&rsquo; dogs and cats because they crave the attention their 
animals give them.&nbsp; As a responsible pet owner I cautioned that though we 
may feel the need to love and care for every animal that comes along, it may 
not always result in what is best for the pet.&nbsp; Of course a lot of these 
types of situations involved people who volunteered at rescue shelters and saw 
the immense need for more forever homes, but even then it was not always in the 
best interest of the animals they adopted.&nbsp; Existing dogs and cats are not 
able to choose their new &lsquo;brothers and sisters&rsquo; and sometimes the 
stress these animals experienced trying to get along with each other did not 
make for a happy or calm environment.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Angelica</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>When Angelica passed away we started thinking about getting a second dog 
and I knew that whoever we added, Sadie also had to have a say.&nbsp; If we 
were going to get another dog, should it be a male or female?&nbsp; Inter-bitch 
aggression is very common, as are fights between competing males, and while 
dogs of the same sex can co-habit peacefully, it is often better to mix the 
sexes up.&nbsp; It is also advisable that the second dog is either close in age 
or temperament to the existing dog, making sure their energy levels 
match.&nbsp; If a puppy is brought into a home with an established older dog, 
every effort must be made to keep the puppy&rsquo;s desire to play with the 
older dog to a minimum.&nbsp; In some cases a younger dog will breathe new life 
into an older one, but age gaps can also be the cause of major irritations.</p> 
<p>At the end of the day, the decision was made for us when my daughter and I 
spied Jasmine in our local rescue shelter.&nbsp; The tiny six month old 
Chihuahua mix was perhaps not the best physical match for a 75 pound chocolate 
Labrador but the two hit it off almost immediately. Initial introductions were 
made on neutral territory with both dogs on loose leashes, so that they had the 
ability to interact without the frustration of being held too tightly and once 
the initial meeting went well, both dogs were allowed to interact off leash in 
a safe area, giving them freedom to form a relationship.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Jasmine sitting on Sadie</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Established dogs can become jealous when too much attention is given to the 
new addition so I made sure that both dogs got equal attention as well as 
having quality one-on-one time with us.&nbsp; Feeding the dogs separately for 
the first couple of weeks ensured that there were no fights over food bowls, 
and high value chews or toys were given to the dogs in separate rooms so that 
there was no fighting over valuable resources.&nbsp; We rewarded Sadie when she 
behaved well around Jasmine and walked both dogs together to help the bonding 
process.</p> 
<p>Now, of course, I can&rsquo;t remember what life was like with just one 
dog.&nbsp; Jasmine has made all our lives so much richer, including 
Sadie&rsquo;s.&nbsp; The two play, eat, and hang out with each other, sharing 
their toys and sleeping close together.&nbsp; Jasmine loves to rest on 
Sadie&rsquo;s back and Sadie loves the closeness of having her near.&nbsp; I 
have noticed a pep in Sadie&rsquo;s step since Jasmine came and the eight year 
age difference does not seem to bother either of them.&nbsp;&nbsp; It might 
have taken a little while to get this point but adding a second dog was the 
best decision our family ever made.</p> 
<p>I&rsquo;m often asked &lsquo;how many dogs is it OK to own?&rsquo;&nbsp; 
The short answer is that it depends on your specific situation, but I am a firm 
believer that adding additional pets to an only-pet household can often create 
far more net benefits than problems, provided you do it responsibly and take 
care to keep all of the animals&rsquo; best interests at heart.&nbsp; You can 
find a lot of great information about adding more pets to your household 
responsibly via my friends at Pets Add Life (www.petsaddlife.org). </p> <br>

<h3>Victoria&rsquo;s Interview With Dr. Sophia Yin &ndash; Part II</h3> Posted 
by Victoria Stilwell - 11/17/11 at 11:11:31 am -5 Comments<br>

<p></p> 
<p>Part two of my interview with Dr. Sophia Yin about her new book, Perfect 
Puppy in 7 Days:<strong><br>
</strong></p> 
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> 
<p><strong>Victoria:&nbsp; Perfect Puppy in 7 Days really focuses a lot on 
early learning and socialization. In fact, John Bradshaw, author of Dog Sense, 
says &ldquo;Worth buying for the socialization advice and checklist 
alone.&rdquo;&nbsp; Can you explain to our blog readers Why is socialization so 
important?</strong></p> 
<p>Sophia:&nbsp; People frequently have dogs who are fearful and later 
aggressive out of fear to unfamiliar people and dogs. They tend to think their 
dog must have been abused, when a much more likely scenario is that the puppy 
was not fully socialized starting at a young age. When puppies are between 3 
weeks and 3 months of age, they are primed to be curious, and to bond to 
animals in their environment. But as they get older their default setting is to 
be fearful of all the things that they were not introduced to early on. This is 
a survival mechanism. It&rsquo;s why wild animals don&rsquo;t come out and 
visit and try to make friends with people all the time. It&rsquo;s also how 
wild animals stay alive. If they approach everything without fear, they are 
likely to get eaten.</p> 
<p>The implication with puppies is that we need to give them many positive 
experiences. with friendly, well-behaved dogs, unfamiliar people, new objects 
and &nbsp;different environments during their sensitive period for 
socialization and continuing into their adulthood. My rule of thumb is that 
they need 100 positive experiences with 100 different people in 100 days. And 
they need to have positive experiences with new dogs on a weekly basis.</p> 
<p>This means that as with children, owners will have to set up play dates and 
make an effort to get their dog into new environments at least 2-4x a week. In
<em>Perfect Puppy</em> <em>in a Week</em>, you&rsquo;ll see that during that 
first week Lucy, the Australian Cattle Dog puppy who was the subject of much of 
the book, had many positive experiences with visitors as well as appropriate 
doggie playmates. She also learned how to be polite around cats and kids.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>VS:&nbsp; What&rsquo;s the biggest problem you see with how people 
socialize puppies currently</strong>?</p> 
<p>SY:&nbsp; Besides just not getting their puppy out enough, the biggest 
problem is that people when they do get them out, they don&rsquo;t realize the 
puppy must have positive experiences, not neutral or negative experiences. That 
means they need to be able to read their puppy&rsquo;s body language so they 
can recognize fear and anxiety. That&rsquo;s why<em>Perfect Puppy in 7 Days</em>
 has sections on reading body language.</p> 
<p>A second issue is that people don&rsquo;t realize the amount of things they 
need to socialize the pet to&mdash;sounds, surfaces, people, other species, new 
environments. And they don&rsquo;t realized that the socialization should start 
with the breeder. Socialization is so important that I cover it in two chapters 
in the book and show pictures of the various situations and items the puppy 
must be socialized to. The early chapter shows how puppies develop their senses 
and how this coincides with what they should be socialized to starting before 8 
weeks of age.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>VS:&nbsp; A week or two really does make a difference in 
socialization, doesn't it?</strong></p> 
<p>SY:&nbsp; For a puppy, a week or two is the equivalent of months for a 
child. For instance, I document the progress of a litter of young puppies and 
show that one puppy is very reactive to handling at 4 weeks of age but with 
several minutes of handling a day, after a week, the puppy can even have 
clippers near him and remains calm. Similarly puppies can also learn unwanted 
behaviors as quickly. For instance, one puppy in the litter highlighted in 
chapter 1 of the book was adopted and would struggle when the owner held him 
wheras previously he&rsquo;d been very tolerant with us. The new owner would 
release him as soon as he struggled and by day 2 he was learning to growl when 
held. After the owner realized her mistake, switched to picking him up and 
giving him treats and then letting him down when he was relaxed. She&rsquo;d 
try to put him down before he started struggling. But even when he did struggle 
a little, because he&rsquo;d been given treats in the handling situation, he 
didn&rsquo;t struggle as much and so she didn&rsquo;t let go. Within a week he 
was back to allowing people to pick him up and place him in different 
positions. So behavior can change quickly in puppies.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>VS:&nbsp; Tell people about the advantage of training puppies as 
young as 8 weeks of age.</strong></p> 
<p>SY:&nbsp; Besides letting them learn the rules before they have a chance to 
learn to break them, when they are young they are less coordinated and this 
gives us a huge advantage. We don&rsquo;t have to be as quick to get the food 
reward or other reward to them. They physically can&rsquo;t jump on us as 
quickly or nip or grab as quickly as an older puppy. So it&rsquo;s easier to 
remove our attention or remove the reward for jumping before they have a 
chance. Training is about rewarding exactly as the correct behaviors occur and 
removing rewards for unwanted behavior such as jumping to grab a toy, before 
they can perform them. When puppies are really young, it&rsquo;s easier for the 
humans to be faster and thus have better timing than if they wait several weeks.
</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>VS:&nbsp; You talk about leadership in the book, but make it clear 
that it&rsquo;s not the same as being the boss? What&rsquo;s the difference?
</strong></p> 
<p>SY:&nbsp; One definition of leadership is the ability to influence an 
individual to perform behavior he would not otherwise perform. By that 
definition, pet owners do need to develop leadership skills. However we have a 
choice of leadership style. We can lead by force like a dictator such as 
Muammar Qaddafi or by providing rewards that the followers want, such as 
Mahatma Ghandi. Schools of marketing and leadership recommend against the 
dictatorial, coercive style of leadership and encourage methods of leading that 
motivate humans through positive methods.</p> 
<p>A similar approach should be used with animals. Instead of using coercion 
we can learn to lead like a leader in a dance. When partners dance as a couple, 
one leads and the other follows. The leader's job is to decide ahead of time 
which steps to perform and then guide his partner in a clear manner so that the 
partner CAN follow. Partners who have to shout out the steps or who yank their 
follower around don't make the cut. With animals the approach is similar. If we 
set rules and have a clear picture of what we want, then we can consistently 
convey this information to the puppy through our body language and perfectly 
timed rewards. To see this concept in action, &nbsp;watch the video: 
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVVBGJi5v9s&amp;feature=related</p> 
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> 
<p><strong>VS:&nbsp; Marty Becker, veterinarian on Good Morning America has 
said it&rsquo;s not just about teaching your puppy manners, it's a step-by-step 
recipe for bonding with your puppy, learning to communicate with him, and 
preparing you pup for life!&nbsp; Can you explain how your book shows a step by 
step recipe for bonding?</strong></p> 
<p>SY:&nbsp; One aspect of the book is my version of the Learn to Earn Program 
where the puppy learns that the way he gets what he wants &mdash;praise, 
petting, to go outside, to come inside, to get bits of his meal, to play 
fetch&mdash;is to sit politely and ask you. It&rsquo;s not about forcing him to 
sit, it&rsquo;s about rewarding him over and over throughout the day. If 
you&rsquo;ve read the &ldquo;Compass of Pleasure&rdquo; by David Levin, you 
know that a high rate of reinforcement can have an almost addicting affect. For 
instance, the reason cigarettes are much more addicting than heroin, which is 
much more potent is that smokers get many many little rewards on a daily basis. 
Similarly with puppies, if they are working for their entire meal and 
everything they like, they are also getting probably 200 rewards a day for good 
behavior and they are learning that unwanted behavior does not work. Through 
this process they learn that you are consistent and you are able to communicate 
what you want in a clear manner (with good timing). As a result, they learn 
they can depend on you. It&rsquo;s much easier to trust someone who always does 
what they say they will do and who communicates in a language you can 
understand.</p> 
<p>I also use the Learn to Earn Program to quickly build a bond with any new 
dog I take in, as a first step for training anxious dogs they can look to their 
owners for guidance or help in scary situations, and for helping dogs who have 
lost their family members to guide them into a more structured situation.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>VS:&nbsp; In the testimonials people say over and over that the 
book is fun. One trainer says &ldquo; I own tons of dog training books and none 
of them are as much to read as this one. Was it your intention to make the 
reading enjoyable?</strong></p> 
<p>SY:&nbsp; Yes, both people and dogs learn best if the learning is fun. And 
for me, I&rsquo;m more interested in writing books that will also be fun for me 
to read.&nbsp; Just having a wide array of photos that depict every type of 
situation you might meet make the book engaging and documenting the progress of 
both the litter of puppies as well as of Lucy, the main main character/puppy 
depicted on the front of the book, made the process enjoyable. I love watching 
puppies and noticing how they develop and how minor events shape their behavior 
and personality. So it was just natural to document these things so that 
everyone else could see.</p> 
<p>Because of the fun and clear instructions, many puppy class instructors 
have told me they are going to use it for their classes, and at least one large 
puppy program will be revising their classes to follow the<em>Perfect Puppy 
</em>program.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>VS:&nbsp; Any last messages you want to send?</strong></p> 
<p>SY:&nbsp; Yes. Blog readers, please feel free to visit my web site 
(www.drsophiayin.com) and Facebook fan page 
(www.facebook.com/sophiayin.dvm).&nbsp; I have lots of free downoadable posters

how kids and dogs should interact, as well as many article and videos on 
behavior.&nbsp; In fact I was voted one of<em>Bark Magazine&rsquo;s 100 Best 
and Brightest</em> because of the website.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>VS:&nbsp; Sophia, thanks so much for all the great info.&nbsp; It 
really is a great book, and I wish you lots of success with it.&nbsp; I'll see 
you at the APDT conference in San Diego!</strong></p>

<p>Dear Victoria:</p> 
<p>I love your show! I have two mini Australian shepherds. My female Alice was 
rescued from a puppy mill. She is very territorial when it comes to men. The 
second a man comes near her she begins barking non-stop. I&rsquo;ve tried my 
command leave it, ignoring her, giving men treats to entice her, but nothing 
has worked! How do I get her to be more comfortable around men? Any advice 
would be much appreciated! Thank you!</p>

<h3>Jim Crosby Weighs in on Lennox</h3> Posted by Victoria Stilwell - 10/12/11 
at 10:10:55 am -70 Comments<br>

<p></p> 
<p><strong>Valuable insight into the Lennox case from Jim Crosby, retired 
Police Lieutenant and Canine Dog Bite Investigator:</strong></p> 
<p>Over the last few months I have watched the case of Lennox, a dog seized 
for having the &ldquo;wrong&rdquo; looks, as it has unfolded in Belfast, 
Ireland.&nbsp; Lennox was seized, not for behavior, but because he has a 
particular physical structure.&nbsp; He looks like what Ireland terms a 
&lsquo;restricted breed&rsquo;.&nbsp; He is neutered, has obedience training, 
is properly vaccinated and was legally licensed-yet he was summarily seized and 
has been condemned to die.&nbsp; As I have watched Lennox&rsquo;s case, and his 
impending death sentence, several things have sparked my attention. Not only 
does the issue of destroying this animal solely based on his looks appall me, 
but I am particularly concerned by the &quot;evaluations&quot; of Lennox that 
the Council and Court are depending on to make a determination of his level of 
threat to society.</p> 
<p>To begin, Lennox has been held for over a year in a shelter facility.&nbsp; 
He has been deprived of his normal social contacts-his family, has had limited 
exercise and interaction outside his kennel, and has even been medicated with 
amitriptyline.</p> 
<p>Two dog behaviorists have evaluated the dog to date.&nbsp; I understand 
both have weighed in that Lennox is not a dangerous dog.&nbsp; The videos and 
evaluations have shown Lennox to have substantial control of his behavior, that 
he is a sociable and pleasant animal despite his long isolation and confinement 
away from his home, and that he showed clear restraint when one evaluator 
pushed him into a trapped area in a threatening manner.&nbsp; At that crisis 
point Lennox did the only thing that makes sense to a dog; he lunged, with no 
contact, in order to communicate clearly that he was frightened and felt 
threatened when he had no where else to retreat.&nbsp; He did the equivalent to 
a human raising their voice when other means of communication fail.</p> 
<p>This speaks volumes for this individual dog.&nbsp; Despite everything that 
has happened to him he still shows restraint in his behavior and a desire for 
human social contact.&nbsp; He still displays clear bite inhibition.&nbsp; He 
still responds appropriately to social cues.&nbsp; This is also despite the 
conduct of these evaluations in a restricted shelter environment.</p> 
<p>The third evaluation was conducted by a police dog handler.&nbsp; As a 
retired police Lieutenant I have known a number of canine handlers-and the 
trainers that prepare the dogs before police get them.&nbsp; I have 
participated in the testing and evaluation of police dogs before their 
training.&nbsp; And I can say this-police canine handlers and trainers are 
special, valued and talented persons-but they are not behaviorists.</p> 
<p>A police dog is a special animal.&nbsp; Only about ten percent of the 
candidates are chosen.&nbsp; They need terrific drive, huge levels of 
trainability, and a great desire to work in tandem with a human handler.&nbsp; 
They must be brave enough to go in where no person or animal reasonably should, 
yet must be able to instantly disengage when ordered to, despite inertia and 
provocation.&nbsp; They must not be aggressive, as anger would interfere with 
the ability to disengage at need.&nbsp; They must also be able to use nearly 
human levels of discrimination to understand when they must self-deploy to 
protect their handler, yet must recognize the difference between a violent 
suspect and the approach of an innocent child.&nbsp; We ask so much of them-and 
they give it all willingly, sometimes to the death.</p> 
<p>Police dog handlers and trainers must be highly skilled to get this level 
or performance.&nbsp; But that skill is limited to the task at hand.&nbsp; 
Police handlers do not address behavior problems of other animals-they are 
focused on the training, maintenance and development of their special 
charges.&nbsp; These handlers conduct obedience work with their dogs as part of 
the control mechanism, but do not diagnose or treat problems that range from 
house training to nuisance barking.&nbsp; They do not treat, or particularly 
evaluate, aggression issues.&nbsp; If a dog exhibits aggression in training it 
is eliminated as unsuitable.&nbsp; An aggressive or &quot;mean&quot; dog is a 
risk to the Department, the handler, and the public.</p> 
<p>Even Animal Control Officers may be deficient when evaluating what is a 
&quot;dangerous&quot; dog.&nbsp; They encounter animals that are often not at 
their best, often threatened or injured, and frankly do not get the behavioral 
training necessary to make the decision between treatment of repairable 
behavior and that which is clearly dangerous.&nbsp; They can say whether a 
dog's behavior, in a specific incident, meets the legal definition of 
&quot;dangerous&quot; in their jurisdiction, but often fall far short of being 
able to diagnose whether this was truly dangerous aggression or was a storm 
brought about by a collection of predictable, reasonable animal behavior and 
human failing.&nbsp; In the case of Lennox the dog warden's job was in some 
ways too easy; did Lennox look like one of the &quot;usual 
suspects&quot;?&nbsp; He did, so the case was closed, even though Lennox never 
had a chance to speak.</p> 
<p>Assessing dog aggression, and evaluating whether a dog is 
&quot;dangerous&quot;, even when presented with clear criteria (which do not 
exist in this case) is a job best left to those familiar with more than just 
whether a dog is physically able to bite.&nbsp; Any dog can bite-they have 
teeth.&nbsp; A competent evaluator must understand the psychological issues 
behind the multiple behaviors we lump together as aggression.&nbsp; Is the dog 
territorial?&nbsp; Is the dog a resource guarder? Is the dog fearful? Can the 
dog adapt to novel and potentially scary situation while maintaining an 
acceptable level of composure? Is the dog responsive to human signals, and is 
the dog able to signal its own intentions clearly?&nbsp; Does the dog have the 
inter-species social skills needed to peacefully coexist in a multi-species 
social environment?&nbsp; Those are the questions that need to be asked before 
determining if a dog's behavior is &quot;dangerous&quot;.</p> 
<p>Having a police dog handler evaluate Lennox for his suitability as a patrol 
or detection dog would be appropriate; it would be having a skilled technician 
and trainer choosing whether Lennox would make the cut as a working dog.&nbsp; 
We would not ask the police trainer to evaluated Fire Department equipment, 
even though he might like the red suspenders.&nbsp; To have the police handler 
evaluating Lennox as a behaviorist is a disservice to the dog-and the handler.
</p> 
<p>And the worst part of this?&nbsp; The case is no longer about Lennox.&nbsp; 
It is about rules, it is about discrimination, and finally about egos.&nbsp; 
Problem is, the bruised egos will heal-but when Lennox is dead, he is dead.</p>

<h3>Lennox Update &ndash; Statement from Sarah Fisher</h3> Posted by Victoria 
Stilwell - 10/11/11 at 09:10:37 am -47 Comments<br>

<p></p> 
<p>In a few days Lennox is scheduled to be destroyed.&nbsp; More and more 
people are calling for his release and we can only hope that somehow this might 
happen.&nbsp; There have been numerous legitimate offers from sanctuaries in 
Southern Ireland and the United States willing to take Lennox, with the 
knowledge and funding to do it. &nbsp;&nbsp;I implore the courts and Judge to 
consider this option.&nbsp; What still concerns me about this case however, is 
how incredibly unjust it has been from the start.&nbsp; What also sickens me is 
that those against Lennox and the case are now releasing footage of a small 
part of Sarah Fisher&rsquo;s assessment, like they did with David Ryan&rsquo;s 
assessment, which has been taken out of context, misread and misunderstood by 
these people&rsquo;s ignorance.&nbsp; Sarah is a true professional in every 
respect, but she has been forced to issue the statement below because of 
misinformation that is being spread by the ignorant few and I would encourage 
all of you to read it and learn the truth about Lennox&rsquo;s behavior.</p> 
<p>Sarah Fisher is one of the nation&rsquo;s leading experts in the field of 
canine behavior as well as being a TTouch practitioner.&nbsp; She has spent 
seventeen years teaching, lecturing, filming, writing and working with a wide 
variety of dog breeds in the UK, South Africa and other European 
countries.&nbsp; She works with shelter dogs, assistance dogs, working dogs, 
competition dogs and family dogs and specializes in working with animals who 
suffer from health and/or behavior problems and those in need of 
training.&nbsp; &nbsp;Because of her additional experience in canine physiology 
she notices structural abnormalities in dogs that others miss and more 
compelling evidence comes out from her evaluation of Lennox that this is a dog 
that does not deserve to be in the position that he has found himself in. 
&nbsp;This has happened to him because of highly flawed, knee-jerk legislation, 
developed from human fear and ignorance.</p> 
<p>Sarah has asked that I post the following statement from her, and we 
encourage you to share it and re-post as widely as possible:</p> 
<h3></h3> 
<h3><strong>Statement on Lennox by Sarah Fisher</strong></h3> 
<p>It has been brought to my attention that a small clip of my assessment of 
Lennox has been put on the internet.&nbsp; This clip has been taken completely 
out of context and whilst I have remained relatively quiet on this case since I 
spoke in court, I feel that I am now forced to make a statement to clarify what 
actually happened during the time I was with Lennox.</p> 
<p>Wrongly or rightly many documents and details about this case have been 
passed onto different parties. I do not feel it is appropriate for me at this 
moment to discuss in detail everything that has been said to me, nor to put 
forward my own ideas regarding all the statements made, as everyone is entitled 
to their own opinion and beliefs.&nbsp; What I am qualified to do however is to 
discuss behaviour. My assessments, statements and videos of those assessments 
have been accepted in other court cases at Magistrates, County and Crown Courts 
here in the UK so the field of assessment in cases such as this is not unknown 
to me.</p> 
<p>I do not care if I am to be criticized by members of the public or even 
other professional bodies as I have a wealth of experience handling and working 
with many breeds of dogs, large and small and I also work with horses with 
behavioural issues so do not need to defend the claims that I have little or no 
experience of working with powerful animals such as Pit Bull Types. I would 
however like to clarify that a Pit Bull Type is often a mix of dogs.&nbsp; 
Nothing extraordinary happens to the psyche of a dog when it conforms to 
certain measurements.</p> 
<p>I do care however that Lennox is being portrayed in a poor light through 
this video clip as my experience of handling Lennox was thoroughly enjoyable 
and I now feel the need to explain in greater detail the truth, as I see it, 
about my assessment.&nbsp; I know that Victoria Stilwell has been what I would 
consider to be a sane voice amidst the madness that surrounds this case and she 
has seen full video footage of the assessments carried out by myself and David 
Ryan plus other documentation.</p> 
<p>When the door to the van was first opened Lennox barked.&nbsp; He barked at 
me three times when I approached.&nbsp; As I said in my report this is not 
uncommon behaviour in any dog that is in a confined situation in a crate, 
kennel or in a car.&nbsp; He was also shaking like a leaf but this does not 
come over in the video that my assistant took of this assessment.&nbsp; He was 
clearly frightened as he could not have known what was going to happen to him 
and again this is not an uncommon behaviour in the dogs that come to me for 
help. No one has ever disputed that Lennox can be anxious around some strangers 
but I believe the key word some has sadly been overlooked.</p> 
<p>I asked for someone that Lennox knew to take him out of the crate to keep 
his stress levels low. Entry and exit points can be a source of conflict for 
any dog. I was told I had to handle Lennox on my own for the entire assessment 
and that he had bitten the last person that came to see him.&nbsp; This is the 
clip that has been released.&nbsp; Had I had any concerns for my safety or 
those around me given that I was to be fully and wholly responsible for a dog 
that I do not know and that I had been told has bitten, I would not have 
continued with the assessment if I believed that dog to be a danger either to 
myself or those who were standing in the car park. Lennox gave me a lot of 
information about his temperament whilst in the crate.&nbsp; In court however, 
and therefore under oath, Ms Lightfoot the Dog Warden stated that in fact 
Lennox had not bitten anyone so I have to assume on the evidence placed before 
the court that the statement made to me at the start of my assessment was 
untrue.&nbsp; Given the publicity surrounding this case I am also confident 
that had Lennox actually bitten anyone whilst in the care of his family as has 
been suggested someone would have come forward by now.</p> 
<p>I spent approx 15 minutes with Lennox prior to being taken from the crate, 
working with a clicker and some treats to see if, even in the environment that 
was causing him some anxiety, he could still learn and take direction from a 
stranger. He could. His eyes were soft and he was friendly. At this point I 
would also like to clarify the meaning of the word friendly.&nbsp; It does not 
mean confident.&nbsp; Was Lennox anxious? Yes.&nbsp; Hostile?&nbsp; No.</p> 
<p>I believe that Lennox would have been totally at ease had I indeed taken 
him out myself but I also believe I have a duty of care to reduce stress where 
possible when handling any animal<strong> </strong>in a situation that is 
causing them distress.&nbsp; No doubt this statement will also be taken out of 
context by those who wish to discredit me and to discredit my belief that 
Lennox is not a danger to the public based on my experience with him and also 
based on the video assessment carried out by David Ryan which I have also seen.
</p> 
<p>I use food in an assessment to monitor the dogs stress levels and emotions 
at all times. It is not a bribe. A habitually aggressive dog will generally 
seek out conflict in my experience but even these dogs can often be 
rehabilitated. No amount of food can disguise this behaviour and giving food to 
a dog with aggression issues can be extremely dangerous. The dog may be lured 
to a person by the promise of food but once it has taken the food it may panic 
as the offering of the food has now brought that dog into close proximity with 
the threat i.e. a stranger. I have worked with dogs with aggression issues and 
whilst some may well take the food, the person delivering the food may not be 
able to move once the food has gone as the movement of the person, even the 
smallest movement of their arm, may trigger the dog to lunge and bite. I would 
not hand feed a dog that I deem to be aggressive. The delivery of the treat 
must come from the person that the dog knows and trusts - not the stranger. The 
dog can learn to approach a threat and then turn back to the person that the 
dog trusts for the reward if the approach to the person is appropriate.&nbsp; I 
use food throughout an assessment to monitor what is happening with the dog on 
an emotional and physical level not to make him my best friend.</p> 
<p>Lennox was so gentle with the taking of the food both in the crate and also 
later in the car park.&nbsp; He was also appropriate in his behaviour with the 
games we played. He was also gentle when he jumped up at me to see if he was 
allowed the food that I was withholding in my hand. When he realised it wasn't 
forthcoming he politely backed off. This would suggest to me that he has been 
around a family. Not chained up in a yard as has also been claimed by people 
who do not know the family or the dog.</p> 
<p>Lennox showed excellent impulse control at all times and at no point did he 
grab me or my own clothing which many dogs do when getting excited by a 
game.&nbsp; I have worked with some truly challenging dogs and some will become 
increasingly aroused by lead ragging or games with toys and start seriously 
mouthing or biting the handler&rsquo;s arms or clothing. This can quickly flip 
over to more overt aggression and these dogs can be dangerous particularly if 
they are being handled by just one person.&nbsp; It is imperative that dogs 
with this behaviour are taught a more appropriate way of interacting with 
people and responding to the leash and also greater self control. There are 
many ways to help dogs that have been encouraged, through mishandling and 
misunderstanding, to behave in such a manner.&nbsp; Kicking and beating them is 
certainly not the answer.</p> 
<p>Lennox does rag on the lead but it is very self controlled. He did not 
exhibit any of the behaviours that I have mentioned above. Regardless of what 
some uneducated people may wish to think, it is possible to glean a lot of 
information about a dog through games and food as many behaviour counsellors 
and trainers will confirm.</p> 
<p>I wrote a fifteen page report on my experience with Lennox and my thoughts 
about the David Ryan assessment. In this report I state that I have concerns 
about the appearance of Lennox&rsquo;s neck. In the video I explain this 
too.&nbsp; His ears are unlevel and there was a change in the lay of his coat 
over the Atlas in line with the nuchal ligament that is present between T1 and 
C2 vertebrae.&nbsp; Coat changes often occur in dogs, cats and horses that have 
suffered injury or those that are unwell. I have studied this over seventeen 
years of handling many animals. In all cases where I referred an animal back to 
a vet, whether it was in the care of a shelter, owned by my private clients or 
students that I teach changes to the soft tissue or skeleton were noted on 
further detailed investigation.&nbsp; When I see this around the neck in a dog 
I know that it is likely to give the dog cause for concern when someone unknown 
to that dog attempts to handle the collar or put on or take off a lead.&nbsp; 
Coat changes may well be present where deep bruising has also occurred. Pain 
and pain memory is a key factor in many behavioural problems.</p> 
<p>Lennox was quite rightly put on Amitriptyline. I do not believe that the 
Council have failed in their duty to care for Lennox when it comes to the 
stress that he has been under and I understand that this drug is used to treat 
anxiety and depression.&nbsp; It was with interest, though, that I discovered 
that this drug is also used to treat chronic pain in dogs. Again this was 
mentioned in my written report.&nbsp; This may explain in part why my 
experience with Lennox seems to fly in the face of other evidence presented 
before the courts. He was not on Amitriptyline when he was assessed by David 
Ryan.</p> 
<p>I would absolutely move on to touch an animal all over its body in any 
assessment that I do.&nbsp; I may or may not choose to muzzle a dog that is 
unknown to me to do this if I have concerns about the body language that I have 
seen prior to this part of my assessment.&nbsp; I elected not to stroke Lennox 
all over because of my concerns about his neck, the newly forming scabs that 
were present on his flanks and the blood that was present around the nail beds 
around his right hind foot. This decision was made based on the physical 
evidence before me not because I felt I would be in danger.&nbsp; I talked 
about this in court which was open to the public and at the end of my 
assessment which is also on film I explained this to a representative from the 
BCC Dog Warden team and asked if there was anything else that she would like me 
to do with Lennox.&nbsp; She said no.</p> 
<p>I cannot comment on what happened when Lennox was seized or measured by 
Peter Tallack because I wasn't there. I can explain behaviour though and any 
frightened animal can be intimidating. I have recently been in Romania working 
with traumatised horses and two stallions had not been mucked out for months as 
the staff (men) were too scared to go in with them. They called them 'pitbulls' 
such is the misguided impression of this type of dog.&nbsp; Hay had been simply 
thrown over the stable doors and their water buckets were hanging crushed 
against the stable wall. &nbsp;I went in with them, not because I have any 
desire to be a hero, but because I can read an animal well and within minutes 
they were quiet, standing at the end of their stables albeit it pressed up 
against the walls. I was calm with them and we took out all the filthy bedding 
and fetched new water buckets for them too. They didn't attack anyone. They 
were simply terrified and they were not provoked. I spent time with one of them 
on my own, hand feeding him and was finally able to touch his face. This 
process probably took less than half an hour. I was totally absorbed in what I 
was doing and when I turned to walk out I realised that one of the Romanian men 
had been watching me. He raised his eyebrows, gave me the thumbs up and walked 
away. Other people could then go in with this magnificent horse too and hand 
feed him the fresh sweet grass that we had picked from the surrounding fields 
so it isn&rsquo;t simply that I am quiet in my handling of animals nor possess 
some extraordinary skill that can make even the most savage lion behave like a 
lamb when in my company.</p> 
<p>I can perhaps, help an animal that is struggling, gain trust in human 
beings as many people can.&nbsp; I can perhaps work with a difficult animal and 
make it look as though that animal is calm but all the time I am reading that 
animal. Every second of the way. I am looking at the eyes if it is safe to do 
so, I am watching the respiration, I am studying the movement, the set of the 
ears and the tail and so on and my opinions about an animal are based on many 
years of working in this way.&nbsp; One case that will always stand out in my 
mind was a large member of the Bull Breed family.&nbsp; I believe she was two 
years old.&nbsp; I won&rsquo;t go into the details here but I will say that 
when I worked with her she appeared to be very good to the member of kennel 
staff that was watching.&nbsp; At the end of my assessment the member of staff 
asked me what I thought.&nbsp; I sadly had to say that I thought the dog should 
be put to sleep. The member of staff was horrified and I remember her saying 
&lsquo;but she&rsquo;s been so good with you&rsquo;.&nbsp; But I had noticed 
some worrying signs.&nbsp; The shelter ignored my advice and rehomed the dog 
who savaged the new owner so badly the owner ended up in the ICU. Of course the 
dog was immediately destroyed.</p> 
<p>I knew what I was walking into when I agreed to go and assess Lennox for 
the family.&nbsp; To have to defend Lennox outside of the court has, however, 
come as a surprise.&nbsp; I have made this statement to shed a little more 
light on what is a distressing case for all those involved,&nbsp; knowing full 
well that I will no doubt be subject to further scrutiny and criticism. So be 
it. I am not afraid. If nothing else this case has highlighted some important 
issues about the fears and prejudice concerning dogs, their breed types and 
their behaviour. Certainly it highlights the sad truth as Xenephon said so 
wisely in 400 BC. &lsquo;Where knowledge ends, violence begins.&rsquo;</p>

<h3>How the Legal System Failed Lennox</h3> Posted by Victoria Stilwell - 
10/09/11 at 07:10:23 am -128 Comments<br>

<p></p> 
<p>Today people all over the world will be lighting candles in honor of 
Lennox, who, if the courts have their way, will be put to death in less than a 
week by Belfast City Council.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have become personally involved in 
this case, both as an expert and as an advocate for decency and humanity.&nbsp; 
Certain individuals and organizations have been engaged in a last desperate 
attempt to refute the evidence given by experts, who actually met and evaluated 
Lennox, and myself, who viewed all the footage of these assessments.&nbsp; I 
have been informed that a tiny part of David Ryan&rsquo;s assessment where 
Lennox reacted to feeling threatened has now been taken out of context and 
released by itself as &rsquo;evidence&rsquo; that Lennox is a dangerous 
dog.&nbsp; I will explain Lennox&rsquo;s behavior at that point in a moment, 
but what I want to stress is what is NOT shown, which is the rest of David 
Ryan&rsquo;s hour long evaluation where Lennox allows a complete male stranger, 
David Ryan, to handle him, tease him, walk him, sit by him, lead him and touch 
him without any negative reaction whatsoever.&nbsp; In fact during this time 
Lennox was giving all kinds of pacification signals, choosing to turn away from 
David when he felt uncomfortable, rather than bite, maul or attack 
him.&nbsp;&nbsp; There has been so much misinformation and ignorance 
surrounding this case from the start, because unless you fully understand dog 
communication and signals it is easy to miss, as all of these people have, 
everything that Lennox is trying to communicate.</p> 
<p>In my official report I stated:&nbsp; &lsquo;Lennox showed a number of 
deference behaviours including turning his head away, licking his lips, turning 
his body and walking away, in response to David Ryan&rsquo;s attempts to 
frustrate him.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is an impressive trait in any dog and shows a 
dog using submissive behaviour rather than offensive behaviour to cope in what 
is a relatively stressful situation.&rsquo;</p> 
<p>At one point Lennox lunged at David Ryan, the piece of video that has been 
released in a sad attempt, by those against Lennox and the campaign to free 
him, to show what a dangerous dog he is.&nbsp; This has in actual fact 
back-fired, because now it gives me no choice but to comment, as an expert with 
fifteen years experience of canine behavior and ten years of working with all 
breeds including pit bull types in the United States, on that particular 
reaction, that I included in my statement to the courts.</p> 
<p>My report continued:&nbsp; &lsquo;If a dog, that would rather practice 
avoidance and take himself away from threat, is unable to do so and the threat 
comes closer and does not allow the dog any chance to escape, the dog has no 
other choice but to respond defensively.&nbsp; Lennox reacted defensively when 
David Ryan approached him and Lennox was stuck between two chairs and the wall 
with nowhere to go to.&nbsp; He tried to get away but when this failed he 
lunged defensively at David Ryan.&nbsp; Even though this was a defensive 
gesture, Lennox still showed incredible impulse control and bite 
inhibition.&nbsp; A dog is faster than the fastest Olympic athlete when it 
comes to response time.&nbsp; If Lennox intended to harm David Ryan he could 
have easily bitten him while he lunged, before Mr. Ryan had time to react, but 
Lennox chose to warn him (a complete stranger) out of his space instead, rather 
than inflict harm, and this was impressive to see&hellip;&hellip; Lennox showed 
impressive restraint and lunged at David Ryan with the intent to warn him to go 
away from him, without harming him. &lsquo;</p> 
<p>You see, this is essentially what people do not understand.&nbsp; Behind 
every growl, snap, lunge etc is a dog signalling its intent.&nbsp; The intent 
is to warn someone or something out of its space.&nbsp; Aggression serves an 
important function, to increase distance, to get the threat to move away.&nbsp; 
Some dogs, especially those that have been dominated, suppressed or abused by a 
human, learn by that mishandling to not give these warning signals and suppress 
these signals, going straight to bite.&nbsp; These dogs are made dangerous 
because of what humans teach them in their attempt to curb unwanted 
behavior.&nbsp; The dogs that warn instead of going to bite are less dangerous 
because they are signaling their intent first.&nbsp; If this warning is not 
heeded, they will lunge or try another way of getting that someone to move away 
from them, still<strong>without intent to harm</strong>.&nbsp; This is what 
Lennox had no choice but to do.&nbsp; Believe me, he could have inflicted a lot 
of harm on David if he was truly the dangerous dog that some people believe he 
is and instead Lennox chose not to bite, maul, attack or inflict damage in any 
way, shape or form.&nbsp; He lunged and barked at David instead.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
When that was done, Lennox continued to show many appeasement and pacification 
signals as well as signaling his stress, such as lip licking and turning his 
head and body away.</p> 
<p>I also witnessed Sarah Fisher&rsquo;s assessment on Lennox and, again, most 
of her assessment won&rsquo;t be shown because the world would then see how 
impressive Lennox was with yet another complete stranger handling him.&nbsp; At 
one point Lennox started playing with the leash, something that many bored dogs 
do, regardless of breed.&nbsp; At no point did he threaten Sarah, try to bite 
her or become aggressively aroused when she pulled the leash away from him and 
he &nbsp;released the leash when he was asked to.&nbsp; The&nbsp; 
prosecution&rsquo;s &lsquo;expert&rsquo;, Peter Tallack, a police dog handler, 
was apparently dismissive of the majority of Fisher&rsquo;s report, saying that 
she did not &lsquo;challenge&rsquo; the dog enough and was more focused on 
building a rapport with the dog.&nbsp; In his ruling, the judge in this case 
showed yet another flaw in the execution of BSL, in that he clearly is not 
aware of the basics of dog behavior and basically decided to believe that 
Tallack&rsquo;s confrontational approach rather than Fisher&rsquo;s experienced 
and scientificially-based methodology was more influential in his 
decision-making.</p> 
<p>The judge basically had a choice to make:&nbsp; do I believe the police dog 
handler, or a learned and internationally respected dog behaviorist with 
extensive experience regarding dog aggression.&nbsp; He apparently fixated on 
the fact that due to Britain&rsquo;s BSL laws, she had little experience 
working with actual pit bull type dogs, finding that to be a major flaw in her 
credibility and authority. Yet again, this shows an ignorance at the heart of 
the problems with BSL:&nbsp; to conduct a behavioral assessment of a pit bull 
type dog does not require any special training or experience other than what 
would be required for any other breed of dog.&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, they are a 
strong breed, but I have no doubt that Fisher has worked with countless larger 
dogs, including other bully breeds types, capable of inflicting as much or more 
harm than the strongest pit bull could.</p> 
<p>The judge based his decision that Lennox was a threat to society on 
stereotypes, misleading &lsquo;expert&rsquo; reports, and his own apparent 
distrust of strong dogs. &nbsp;&nbsp;In his ruling, Judge Rodgers repeatedly 
refers to an episode where Lennox jumped up on and knocked back the dog warden 
who came to confiscate him.&nbsp; Court records indicate that two other animal 
control employees witnessed this.&nbsp; Even though the actual behavioral cause 
and effect &nbsp;of such an action can almost always be successfully and 
appropriately explained, the main point here is that a person such as Judge 
Rodgers, who is unqualified to analyze dog behavior, can easily and mistakenly 
draw incorrect conclusions regarding the severity, motivation for and 
circumstances surrounding such behavior.&nbsp; If all dogs who jump up on 
strangers in their house were guilty of being dangerous dogs, there would not 
be many dogs left in homes.&nbsp; To fixate on this occurrence and point to it 
as further proof of Lennox&rsquo;s dangerousness is reckless and misguided.</p> 
<p>Every person can form and will form an opinion on a snapshot of behaviour 
they see, taken out of context and misunderstood by ignorance.&nbsp; Both David 
Ryan and Sarah Fisher have stated that Lennox is not a dangerous dog and I will 
stand by their cumulative years of expertise in the field of canine behavior, 
rather than listen to those who, through no fault of their own, cannot read or 
misunderstand canine &lsquo;language.&rsquo;</p> 
<p>In the 18 months since Lennox was taken from his family and put in a 
stressful environment and situation away from those he trusted and loved most, 
he has been a pawn in a political game that serves to take a flawed piece of 
legislation, such as BSL, to an all time disgraceful level.&nbsp; BSL makes 
innocent dogs the criminals because of how they look, regardless of their 
actual temperament.&nbsp; Your money, taxpayers&rsquo; money, is being spent by 
councils &nbsp;to seek out and confiscate these breed types, taking innocent 
family members away from their families, rather than tackling the real issue 
of&nbsp; dangerous dogs.&nbsp; If Belfast City Council and other governments 
like it really want to keep a community safe, go after the irresponsible owners 
who either raise their dogs in a violent manner, do not socialize them or 
integrate them into society in any way, allow their dogs to wander off leash 
and do not heed any warning signs or make any attempt to curb aggressive 
behavior.&nbsp; Seek to penalize them to the full extent of the law, and 
protect your citizens by addressing the issue of dangerous dogs of all breeds, 
not spending your tax payers&rsquo; money on taking innocent dogs away from 
their families because of the way they look.</p> 
<p>There are two sides to any story and there are always things that are said 
out of sadness, anger, frustration and pain.&nbsp; &nbsp;I do not condone 
violence or threatening behavior of any sort to any persons involved in this 
case.&nbsp; But whatever continues in the human battle over this issue, my 
frustration lies with the fact that regardless what has been said, the true 
experts&rsquo; opinions in Lennox&rsquo;s case have been thrown over for 
behavioral opinions that were given by the prosecution&rsquo;s expert Peter 
Tallack, even though he stated himself that he was not brought on to do a 
&lsquo;behavioural test or assessment&rsquo; of Lennox, but to assess only 
whether Lennox was of pit bull type or not.&nbsp; He himself admitted that the 
&lsquo;circumstances in which Lennox is being examined are not ideal&rsquo; and 
in this he was absolutely right.&nbsp; Even if he was brought onto do a 
behavioral assessment, you cannot do a proper assessment or get a true picture 
of behavior of any dog in or around the vicinity of the kennel where that dog 
is being confined and where it is experiencing fear, stress and 
confusion.&nbsp; To get a true picture of behavior tests should be done in all 
different environments and situations including confined spaces, the home 
environment, and other indoor and outdoor locations, on and off leash and 
different times of the day.&nbsp; &nbsp;As he stated, his examination was 
&lsquo;90% physical conformation and only 10% behavioural&rsquo; and therefore 
his findings were, &lsquo;based on how Lennox looks and not how he 
behaves,&rsquo; yet his statements on Lennox&rsquo;s behavior under thephysical 
examination he was supposed to be conducting, were upheld and championed as key 
components of the judge&rsquo;s decision to euthanize Lennox.&nbsp;&nbsp; I 
agree with those who say that you cannot predict future behavior in any animal 
just as you cannot predict it in any human.&nbsp; The judge also fixated on the 
concept that the dog is unpredictable.&nbsp; What dog isn&rsquo;t?&nbsp; What 
animal isn&rsquo;t unpredictable?&nbsp; If a dog is truly dangerous then I want 
that dog off the streets as much as the next person, but Lennox has been so 
unfairly treated in this case because of the situation that he was taken, the 
stress he has had to endure since his confinement and now the cruelty of those 
who seek to destroy him and his family with malicious particularly over social 
media, that someone needs to highlight the fact that from the start, Lennox was 
never given a fair chance.&nbsp; This case was decided the day Lennox was taken 
from his family in May 2010.</p> 
<p>I myself have been threatened in different ways by supporting Lennox and 
his family, but that is what fear does.&nbsp; In order to hide the truth and 
serve a purpose, people will use intimidation tactics to scare others away, in 
an attempt to stop the truth from coming out.&nbsp; To the few that use threats 
against me and others, there are millions of people around the world singing 
with one voice.&nbsp; I am not alone, but am supported by those millions that 
are sick of seeing these witch hunts take place, when the real issue of 
dangerous dogs is not being addressed and people are still getting hurt or 
losing their lives to dog attacks because of irresponsible ownership.&nbsp; BSL 
tackles the wrong end of the leash and we should be putting our efforts into 
stopping future attacks by actual dangerous dogs, rather than putting the focus 
on taking animals away from their families because of the way they look.</p> 
<p>Lennox is scheduled to be euthanized in a few days.&nbsp; Chances for 
overturning the verdict are slim, and having read the judge&rsquo;s official 
opinion in the case, I hold very little hope that he will recognize he has let 
his personal feelings about this issue cloud his decision-making process.&nbsp; 
He has chosen to rely on people unqualified to correctly assess and describe 
the true nature of certain events relating to dog behavior.&nbsp; We will 
campaign for justice throughout Lennox&rsquo;s life and beyond.&nbsp; We must 
learn from this and make Lennox and his family&rsquo;s struggle a rallying cry 
for change.</p>

<h3>Introducing Pets to New Babies</h3> Posted by Victoria Stilwell - 10/06/11 
at 01:10:37 pm -6 Comments<br>

<p></p> 
<p>It seems like every few weeks, a fresh news story about a family pet 
seriously injuring or killing a baby hits the airwaves.&nbsp; And every time, 
we all say and hear the same well-meaning and accurate but tired talking points 
about how devastating it is, how it could have and should have been avoided, 
who to blame, who not to blame and what to do about the problem.&nbsp; The 
general theme is that the ultimate responsibility lies with the parents and/or 
dog owners, not the children.&nbsp; That any breed of dog can bite, and any 
breed of dog can be a good family pet.&nbsp; That parents should never leave 
their kids alone with any animals unsupervised.&nbsp; That government should 
focus on penalizing irresponsible dog owners, not certain breeds of dogs.</p> 
<p>And I agree with all of that.&nbsp; I've said much of it myself in 
interviews on national press many times.&nbsp; And yet still, these tragic 
incidents keep happening.&nbsp; And that's even not to mention the millions of 
dog bites that go unreported and don't require professional medical 
attention.&nbsp; In the US alone, there are over 4.5 million reported dog bites 
each year, 800,000 of which require a trip to the doctor.</p> 
<p>What we're doing is not working.</p> 
<p>That's why I've dedicated myself and my company's resources to try and make 
a difference and reduce the number of dog bites that happen each year.&nbsp; 
I'm in the process of setting up the first ever Dog Bite Prevention Task Force, 
which is charged with determining what the root causes of the problem are and 
how to effectively address them once and for all.&nbsp; Comprised of trainers, 
behaviorists, legal professionals, legislators, animal control specialists, 
pediatric surgeons and reconstructive surgeons around the country, we will be 
bringing together the best and brightest minds to figure out how and why dog 
bites happen, what precedes them,&nbsp; how they are investigated, who should 
be held responsible, and most importantly, how to stop them from occurring.</p> 
<p>For example, by digging into the data from some of the most high profile 
cases involving canine homicides (the term used when a dog kills a human), 
we've found one fascinating common thread in almost all scenarios:&nbsp; one 
component of the scenario is unnatural.&nbsp; That means that in every case, 
either the child is being looked after by grandparents, the dog is being 
house-sat by an uncle, the whole family (including the dog) are visiting 
relatives in a different house, etc.&nbsp; There's almost always one part of 
the equation that is not the everyday norm for either the dog, child, 
caregivers, or environment.&nbsp; This important revelation can help us 
determine how to most effectively educate dog owners and parents of children 
about what to look out for in an otherwise seemingly normal situation.&nbsp; If 
we can stop just one beautiful little child from losing his or her life, it 
will be worth it.</p> 
<p>But my goal is even larger than that.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Ashlynn Dawn Anderson</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Last year, I had the opportunity to meet with the lovely Anderson 
family.&nbsp; Just over a year ago, they lost their beautiful daughter, 
Ashlynn, in a fatal dog attack.&nbsp; I met the family when I was in Oregon, 
and I was struck by their determination to do everything they can to help other 
families avoid a similar tragedy.&nbsp; They have set up a non-profit 
organization calledDads Against Dangerous Dogs, and though they lost their 
little treasure to dogs, one of the most remarkable things about them is that 
they have not jumped to the most obvious target.&nbsp; They do not blame any 
specific breed for Ashlynn's death, rather they are focused on increasing 
awareness about the fact that any dog - any breed, any size, etc - can be a 
danger to little ones if not properly managed.</p> 
<p>Obviously, education is the key to stopping this from happening.&nbsp; We 
all know that.&nbsp; But we've known it for a long time, and yet the message 
isn't effective enough to make a significant difference.&nbsp; As a society, we 
must figure out a more successful way to get the message across.</p>

<p></p> 
<p>That's why I've decided to support the American Humane Association's safe 
handling initiative - Pet Meets Baby.&nbsp; This is an easy-to-read, 
comprehensive free booklet that can help dog owners and parents of children 
without pets by making them aware of how to safely and effectively introduce 
pets to new babies and vice versa.&nbsp; By widely distributing this 
information in maternity wards, pediatricians' offices and beyond, we hope that 
this will make a difference.&nbsp; It's important to note that even parents of 
children without pets should read Pet Meets Baby, since all kids end up 
interacting with animals at some point, whether at grandma's house, on 
playdates or walking in the park.</p> 
<p>I've donated some great prizes (Positively t-shirts, signed books, <em>It's 
Me or the Dog</em> DVDs, etc) to a free contest anyone can enter by providing 
some brief feedback about Pet Meets Baby.&nbsp; Plus, one lucky winner will win

<h3>Update on Lennox</h3> Posted by Victoria Stilwell - 10/06/11 at 01:10:12 
pm -42 Comments<br>

<p></p> 
<p>Like the tens of thousands of people around the world who have followed the 
story of Lennox, I was devastated by the recent ruling condemning him to death 
in Belfast, Northern Ireland.&nbsp; Lennox was a well-behaved, registered, 
perfectly assimilated family pet who was taken from his very responsible and 
devoted family over a year ago simply because he fit certain measurements which 
had been determined to constitute something called a &ldquo;pit bull 
type.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>As in several other countries, states and territories, Northern Ireland has 
unfortunately continued to adhere to outdated and misguided thinking that 
assumes that a dog&rsquo;s behavior can be determined based on the way it 
looks.&nbsp; Such breed-specific legislation (BSL) has been repeatedly shown to 
be ineffective in reducing the number of dog bites (its advocates&rsquo; usual 
rationale), primarily because it focuses on the wrong end of the leash.&nbsp; 
I&rsquo;ve railed against BSL extensively in the past in previous articles and 
posts &ndash;you can read them here.</p> 
<p>The Belfast City Council and the judge in charge of Lennox&rsquo;s case 
watched and heard expert testimony by some very accomplished behaviorists such 
as the wonderful Sarah Fisher, but they ultimately appear to have chosen to put 
more stock in what they heard from a dog handler named Peter Tallack and some 
of the dog wardens that took him from the family's home.&nbsp; All three 
wardens were found to have lied under oath, but even this did not stop the 
judge from reaching his decision.&nbsp; That decision was a travesty and a 
tragedy.&nbsp; I watched video footage&nbsp; of two extensive evaluations of 
Lennox by Sarah Fisher and another accomplished expert, David Ryan.&nbsp; 
Suffice to say, anyone with even a rudimentary understanding of dog behavior 
would agree that though poor Lennox was a fearful dog, he showed amazing 
impulse control and trust in the strangers that were handling him.&nbsp; The 
overwhelming majority of video evidence I saw supports the family&rsquo;s claim 
that despite the incredibly challenging conditions he&rsquo;s been forced to 
live in for the past year, Lennox remains an innocent dog.&nbsp; Part of 
Tallack's testimony apparently highlighted the fact that a dog should not 
respond defensively even when being mishandled, including being hit, pushed 
around, poked in the eye and shouted at.&nbsp; If a dog reacts aggressively 
while being treated in this manner it is a dangerous dog.&nbsp;&nbsp; He 
obviously sets very high standards for these animals but I'm sure if he was 
pushed around and feared for his life, he would react accordingly in order to 
defend himself.&nbsp; Obviously in his mind, dogs should not do that.</p> 
<p>Like the family and Lennox&rsquo;s many supporters, I have been heartened 
and overwhelmed by the huge response since the verdict came down last 
Friday.&nbsp; The only good news is that there is a 14-day window before 
Lennox&rsquo;s scheduled euthanasia, but this is primarily a procedural 
technicality and does not offer much hope of the judge reversing his 
unfortunate decision.</p> 
<p>What this may do, however, is provide a glimmer of hope that we may appeal 
to some heretofore unseen shred of humanity in the legal decision-makers of 
this case to spare Lennox&rsquo;s life by allowing him to be relocated to a 
jurisdiction that does not practice such draconian methods.&nbsp; We are 
exploring many options and I&rsquo;ll certainly keep you updated, and you can 
check outthe official Save Lennox page here.</p> 
<p>I don&rsquo;t agree with BSL.&nbsp; But when its failings as a concept and 
its cruelty in practice are publicly exposed as they have been in the case of 
Lennox, it truly sickens me.&nbsp; As supposedly civilized societies, we must 
begin to realize that we have a responsibility to do what&rsquo;s right not 
just for us, but also for the animals that we&rsquo;ve chosen to domesticate 
over the past several thousand years.&nbsp; As a passionate advocate for 
responsible dog ownership, I am more than aware of the need to find an answer 
to the issue of increasingly dangerous and common dog bites, especially on 
children.&nbsp; (Check out mydog/child safety tips and American Humane&rsquo;s 
Pet Meets Baby campaign for more info.)&nbsp; However we must recognize that 
human education and awareness are the keys to solving this problem, not banning 
certain types of dogs.&nbsp; Any breed of dog can bite, and any breed of dog 
can be a great family pet.</p> 
<p>Hopefully we&rsquo;ll be able to save Lennox.&nbsp;&nbsp; Either way, 
though, his case has helped highlight what&rsquo;s wrong with BSL and we must 
make sure that his story has not been told in vain.</p> <br>

<h3>Victoria&rsquo;s Interview With Dr. Sophia Yin &ndash; Part I</h3> Posted 
by Victoria Stilwell - 10/06/11 at 01:10:16 pm -1 Comment<br>

<p></p> 
<p>I recently connected with my friend, Dr. Sophia Yin, to discuss training 
young dogs and her new book,<em>Perfect Puppy in 7 Days</em>.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Victoria:&nbsp; There are a lot of puppy books already out there. 
What made you decide to write this book?</strong></p> 
<p>Sophia:&nbsp; I wrote this book because I needed a resource that would 
provide my dog-owning clients. I wanted to provide them with step-by-step, 
photo-illustrated solutions to their most common puppy and adult dog problems. 
&nbsp;You can tell owners and then show them what to do and how to do it but 
they do best when they also have photo-illustrated instructions where each step 
is documented visually in pictures so they can see what the steps look like any 
time they want.</p> 
<p>Even more important, I&rsquo;ve found from the research projects I carried 
out on training protocols and handling procedures, that people also need to see 
what it looks like when they are performing the techniques incorrectly 
otherwise they think they are doing the right thing when in fact they are 
making mistakes.&nbsp; Overall, three factors:</p> 
<ol> 
<li>seeing photos of the training steps</li> 
<li>having enough training steps so that there are no gaps in the sequences, 
and</li> 
<li>seeing what can go wrong, greatly improve the rate of success.</li> </ol> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>VS:&nbsp; In this book, you personalize the book by focusing on the 
training of your fathers&rsquo; Australian Cattle Dog puppy, Lucy. How did you 
make that choice?</strong></p> 
<p>SY:&nbsp; Well, my dad declared one summer that he wanted a new puppy 
because my parents had recently lost their 13-year old Scottie to cancer. He 
knew exactly what he wanted&mdash;an Australian Cattle dog that looked just 
like his past cattle dog Rudy, and he wanted it ASAP.</p> 
<p>Apart from the obvious concern that no matter how much the puppy looked 
like his old dog, it would not act like his old dog, I was concerned about how 
the puppy would eventually turn out. My dad has a history of raising dogs that 
turn out to be aggressive in some situations. Their 13-year old Scottie never 
showed signs because I had owned her first. But their first Boxer was an 
unneutered male who was aggressive to dogs and wandered the neighborhood. The 
second Boxer was a neutered male who was aggressive to some people. His most 
recent Australian Cattle dog, Rudy&mdash;who was otherwise a great 
dog&mdash;was fear aggressive if unfamiliar dogs got in his face. I already 
have a wonderful Jack Russell Terrier, Jonesy, with fear and arousal issues who 
keeps me on my toes, I really didn&rsquo;t need to inherit an aggressive 
Australian Cattle dog down the road. And as you probably know, Australian 
Cattle Dogs can have a tendency towards aggression if not socialized 
appropriately.</p> 
<p>So I decided that I would keep the puppy for a week as soon as I got her 
and then train her as much as possible before giving her to my dad. I knew that 
she could form great habits and be well on her way to being a perfect pup in 
just that one week if I ran her through my Learn to Earn Program and started 
her socialization, so I decided to document her training in pictures (and 
video) so that my clients as well as other dog owners could benefit from my 
task.</p> 
<p>The great thing about using this puppy, Lucy as an example within the book 
is that I can specifically tell people how long it took for her to learn habits 
such as automatically sitting to go through doors, to get petted and to play 
fetch. The information is not just vague. It&rsquo;s very specific and it gives 
people and idea of what can go write and the little glitches along the way.</p> 
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> 
<p><strong>VS:&nbsp; It&rsquo;s called Perfect Puppy in a Week. Can you 
actually get a perfect puppy in a week?</strong></p> 
<p>SY:&nbsp; With the Learn to Earn program where you focus on teaching the 
puppy to say please by sitting for everything she wants and you are aware of 
your every interaction with your puppy, yes, you can form good habits in just a 
week. Each exercise only takes 5-10 minutes for the puppy to learn and we train 
the puppy that it&rsquo;s fun. Probably the coolest thing for owners is that 
they get to see the puppy make the choice to behave in a desired way.</p> 
<p>But what really makes the program unique is that owners learn how to make 
the good behaviors a habit, rather than just a trick performed for treats. 
It&rsquo;s not just about training puppies to sit or come. It&rsquo;s about 
training them to sit or come every time you want them to do so in all the 
appropriate instances. The key is to make it fun and use all of the dog&rsquo;s 
motivators&mdash;food, petting, praise, getting the leash on, going 
outside&mdash;to your advantage and to make sure you don&rsquo;t accidentally 
reward them for the unwanted behaviors. That combination is what makes the 
training so fast.</p> 
<p>That being said, because readers will just be learning the exercises, and 
trying to teach their dog at the same time, it will take longer for them. And 
once the dog knows the exercises, it&rsquo;s about being consistent enough to 
make the polite behaviors a habit. For Lucy, I didn&rsquo;t expect that 
she&rsquo;d be good for my parents until they also learned how to reward the 
good behaviors and make sure she didn&rsquo;t get rewarded for unwanted ones. 
But she was pretty perfect for me, my assistants, and the visitors who visited.
</p> 
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> 
<p><strong>VS:&nbsp; What do you think are the biggest misconceptions people 
have about training puppies?</strong></p> 
<p>SY:&nbsp; People think you should wait until the puppy is older to start 
training and as a result, they spend the first weeks inadvertently rewarding 
unwanted behaviors or instead of controlling the environment and immediately 
setting up the situation for success.</p> 
<p>For instance, puppies are really energetic and love to nip and jump. People 
think that because it&rsquo;s a puppy these behaviors are ok, but once they 
start getting scratches and wounds from the nipping that they have accidentally 
rewarded, or when the puppy is larger and knocking people down, it can be much 
harder to break these habits and form new desired ones. So a behavior that 
could be fixed in just a few days with a puppy might take weeks or months once 
the puppy is older.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>VS:&nbsp; Will starting young ruin your puppy?</strong></p> 
<p>SY:&nbsp; Back when most people were training using force-based methods, 
yes starting puppies young could ruin them. The puppies just learned that 
whatever they did, they&rsquo;d get a correction that might scare them or that 
might hurt. So, you can imagine that dogs that were bred as working dogs would 
not have a high drive to hunt or do protection work if they learned as a puppy 
that the world was a place where humans give lots of scary or painful 
corrections. So these trainers would say you had to wait until the dogs was 
mature enough. What they meant was mature enough to handle the force-based 
corrections without crumbling.</p> 
<p>This whole situation is akin to taking young children and putting him into 
a school program where he is mostly corrected for doing things wrong rather 
than being shown in a step-by-step manner how to do things right, being 
rewarded for good behaviors frequently. I think everyone has had some type of 
incident when they were young and someone told them &ldquo;you&rsquo;re no good 
at that&mdash;you&rsquo;re a bad drawer, or singer, or bad at math&rdquo; and 
those negative words at that young age have stuck with the kids for a long 
time. Similarly for puppies, training based on punishing unwanted behaviors 
rather than setting them up for success can ruin them or at minimum produce a 
very different dog that what you would get otherwise.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>VS:&nbsp; How does your training differ from the correction-based 
training?</strong></p> 
<p>SY:&nbsp; Similar to your approach on <em>Its Me or the Dog</em>, 
science-based training is about rewarding the behaviors we want and removing 
the rewards for unwanted behaviors. And it really focuses on making good 
behavior fun so that the puppy will want to be good. Many people don&rsquo;t 
realize this, but in order to reward only the desired behaviors the humans have 
to be aware of all of their interactions with the dog. For instance, if they 
would like their puppy to greet them politely by sitting instead of jumping on 
them to get them to interact or give attention, they must clearly remove their 
attention, when the puppy starts to jump. Generally that means, standing still 
and looking away. Then as soon as the puppy sits they can reward with a 
sequence of treats&mdash;the first for sitting and the rest for remaining 
seated&mdash; and later with praise and petting, once the puppy can sit for 
food.</p> 
<p>It also means that during other times during the day when the dog solicits 
attention but may not be as excited, they also must remove their attention 
until the dog sits. That is, in the most exciting situations, the dog will 
jump, but in less exciting situations the dog may just push against the owner, 
or climb into the owners lap. If the humans reward the pushy attention behavior 
in the low excitement situations, then they dog will definitely continue to 
perform the pushy behavior in the high excitement situations too. Hence it may 
take forever for the puppy to learn to greet politely.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>VS:&nbsp; This book really focuses on breaking the exercises down 
into steps and on the postures and movement of the owner.</strong></p> 
<p>SY:&nbsp; Yes. The most difficult thing for owners is to realize that dogs 
care what you do now what you say. They don&rsquo;t understand English or other 
language, but they do naturally understand and read your body language. So in 
order to communicate clearly with dogs, we have to be aware of how we&rsquo;re 
standing, how we deliver rewards, and how we move around the dog. For instance 
if you lean over the puppy to give him a treat, he&rsquo;ll have a tendency to 
jump because it looks like you are soliciting attention. That&rsquo;s why for 
treat delivery I focus on standing up straight and bending your knees while 
delivery the treat with an outstretched arm. Similarly if you hold the food 
reward too high, you&rsquo;ll train the dog to jump to get it. It doesn&rsquo;t 
matter if you&rsquo;re telling him &ldquo;no,&rdquo; he&rsquo;s going to pay 
attention more to what your body language says, &ldquo;Jump up to get the treat 
I&rsquo;m extending out to you.&rdquo; So it&rsquo;s important foe people to 
know what their body language is telling the dog so that they can up a 
communicate clearly.</p>

<h3>9/11 Ten Years Later</h3> Posted by Victoria Stilwell - 09/07/11 at 
08:09:43 am -7 Comments<br>

<p></p> 
<p>We all have our stories to tell.</p> 
<p>On that bright September morning ten years ago when the world changed 
before our eyes, our collective experience was etched into our personal 
histories in the way that only those truly transformative historical occasions 
can imprint us:&nbsp; Pearl Harbor, JFK, 9/11.</p> 
<p>Having moved to Manhattan the year before the attacks, I had been going 
through a not entirely smooth transition from the leafy suburbs of 
London.&nbsp; I had been used to driving where I needed to go, having family 
nearby, and regularly escaping into the vast swaths of greenspace that are 
scattered throughout the city where I had lived all my life.&nbsp; Moving to 
New York City with my husband at the beginning of the millennium had been 
rewarding in many ways, but I still harbored deep longing for my hometown while 
somehow slightly resenting New York for not being London.</p> 
<p>We were living in a one-bedroom apartment on the 4th floor of an old 
building in Hell&rsquo;s Kitchen in September, 2001.&nbsp; I was working as a 
dog trainer in and around Manhattan, cutting my teeth in one of the 
world&rsquo;s most unique environments for dogs with some of the most colorful 
clients you could imagine. &nbsp;The events of 9/11 changed all of us in ways 
large and small, and for me, one of those small changes was that I truly became 
a New Yorker.&nbsp; In the spirit of JFK&rsquo;s &ldquo;Ich bin ein 
Berliner&rdquo; moment, I believe that peaceful, loving, selfless citizens all 
over the world became New Yorkers that day.&nbsp; Just as we all also became 
Londoners on 7/7 after the train attacks, Indonesians and Japanese after the 
tsunamis, and Haitians after the earthquake.</p> 
<p>Certain events pull us all together and lead us in new and more fruitful 
directions, sometimes even out of the smoke and rubble of tragedies like those 
endured at the World Trade Center, the Pentagon and Shanksville, 
Pennsylvania.&nbsp; For me, in addition to my newfound sense of ownership and 
pride in my adopted city, those tragic events also provided me a backdrop from 
which I would build an even greater appreciation of the power and grace of 
man&rsquo;s best friend.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Pier 94 on Manhattan's west side served as the Family Assistance Center for 
victims' loved ones.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>In the days and weeks following the attacks on the World Trade Center, the 
West Side Highway along the Hudson River near where we lived became a sort of 
pipeline for those working through the carnage downtown.&nbsp; Countless times 
each hour, a fire truck or bus filled with search and rescue teams hurtled back 
and forth from Ground Zero down a road lined on both sides with well wishers 
and those of us who felt compelled to do something &ndash; anything.&nbsp; Many 
of us who lived nearby felt a constant sense of helplessness &ndash; we wanted 
to be a part of the effort somehow.&nbsp; Part of our city, country and way of 
life had been threatened and disrupted, and we needed to help support those who 
were literally doing the heavy lifting both emotionally and physically.</p> 
<p>I was working as a volunteer adoption counselor at New York&rsquo;s ASPCA 
during this time, and after investigating what options were available to those 
of looking to help during those dark days, I ended up at Pier 94 on the Hudson 
River.&nbsp; FEMA, the Red Cross, and other organizations set up areas within 
the massive pier to organize the search for missing persons, and the ASPCA 
began the task of rehoming animals whose owners had died in the tragedy, as 
well as coordinating the large number of therapy dogs that came to provide 
comfort for the victims&rsquo; families.&nbsp; My job was to organize which 
dogs would accompany the families on the boats making daily trips from the pier 
down the Hudson River to Ground Zero.&nbsp; It was a chance for the families to 
remember their loved ones and to throw flowers and wreaths into the river in 
their memory.</p>

<p>I had been aware of and even worked with a few therapy dogs before 9/11, 
but the days I spent witnessing the immense power of these dogs as they poured 
themselves out for the bereaved was truly amazing, and served as the 
inspiration for what eventually became my charitable foundation.</p> 
<p>Therapy dogs bring comfort and companionship to people in all kinds of 
situations, helping the elderly, the sick and the disabled, relieving their 
pain and anxiety.&nbsp; A therapy dog must be calm, confident, patient and 
enjoy meeting and being touched by strangers.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is well documented 
that dogs improve a person&rsquo;s health by lowering blood pressure, relieving 
anxiety and boosting immunity.&nbsp; Playing with a dog can elevate levels of 
serotonin and dopamine, nerve transmitters that promote pleasure and 
calm.&nbsp; According to several studies, heart attack patients that have pets 
survive longer than those without and male pet owners in particular have lower 
triglyceride and cholesterol levels, two key components of heart disease.&nbsp; 
But even beyond the physiological chemistry of how it all works, to watch a 
therapy dog bring the first smile to the face of a boy who had lost his father 
in the towers was witness to a heartwarming mini-miracle.</p>

<p>The dogs who served during and after 9/11 were shining examples of what has 
become known as hero dogs.&nbsp; Along with Whoopi Goldberg, I am co-hosting a 
tribute evening on behalf of American Humane Association in honor of the search 
and rescue, therapy, and support dogs who gave of themselves so bravely 10 
years ago.&nbsp; The event in New York on September 8th will help kick off 
American Humane Association&rsquo;s Hero Dog month as we lead up to the 
official Hero Dog Awards in L.A. on October 1st.&nbsp; Click here to find out 
more about this special event.</p> 
<p>There are many of us around the world who are dedicated to helping dogs who 
can&rsquo;t help themselves, but I wanted to find a way to help support the 
extraordinary work being done by organizations that helped dogs who help 
people, too.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s why I created theVictoria Stilwell Foundation, 
whose mission is to provide behavior advice and financial assistance to canine 
assistance organizations around the world.&nbsp; Please consider making a 
tax-deductible donation to the Foundation and helping us make the world a 
better place not just for dogs, but also for the people who rely on them for 
help.</p> <br>

<p>As we reflect on the loss we suffered ten years ago and how it changed the 
world we live in, I think it&rsquo;s also important to look forward and try to 
identify whatever positives we can glean from the wreckage.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m 
currently filming the 8th season of <em>It&rsquo;s Me or the Dog</em> in New 
York City, and I feel honored to be back in my adopted city as this important 
anniversary draws near.&nbsp; We will never forget what happened that day, nor 
those who gave their lives then and in the years that have followed so that we 
can live in freedom.</p> <br>

<h3>An Interview With Nicole Wilde</h3> Posted by Victoria Stilwell - 09/07/11 
at 08:09:51 am -1 Comment<br>

<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Clockwise from bottom left: Nicole Wilde, Cathy Bruce, Amber Burkhalter, 
Victoria Stilwell</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>I love Nicole Wilde.&nbsp; She is such a lovely woman and a true powerhouse 
in our collective quest to promote positive training at the expense of 
dominance and fear-based methods.&nbsp; I first met her several years ago when 
she stopped by our house in Atlanta for some dinner while she was in town for 
one of her popular dog training seminars, and we instantly hit it off.</p> 
<p>I recently caught up with Nicole to discuss her latest book, 
&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t Leave Me!&rsquo; &ndash; a fantastic resource for those who 
have dogs struggling with separation anxiety.&nbsp; I love this book, and 
recommend you buy it today if you don&rsquo;t already have it!</p> 
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> 
<p><strong>Victoria Stilwell:&nbsp; What made you decide to write 
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t Leave Me!&rdquo;?</strong></p> 
<p>Nicole Wilde:&nbsp; Well, actually, I wasn&rsquo;t intending to write a 
book about separation anxiety! But a year after our dogs had crossed over, I 
found myself searching the shelters for a new family member. I eventually found 
a wonderful female husky-keeshond mix. When I went to sign the adoption papers, 
I learned that she&rsquo;d been impounded four times previously. I now believe 
that was probably due to a combination of separation anxiety and being a 
consummate escape artist. After the first year living with Sierra and her 
separation issues, I realized that a comprehensive book on the subject was 
warranted. That&rsquo;s our girl Sierra on the cover!</p> 
<p><strong>VS:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What sorts of things did you 
learn by living full-time with a dog who has separation issues, as opposed to 
what you already knew as a professional behavior specialist?</strong></p> 
<p><strong>NW:&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; Living with Sierra has given me a 
much deeper understanding of what owners of dogs with this issue go through. 
Although I had helped many clients to address separation anxiety over the 
years, I hadn&rsquo;t really understood the extent of the emotional turmoil it 
caused to both dog<em>and</em> owner and the upheaval to one&rsquo;s lifestyle.
</p> 
<p>It became important for me to come up with creative management solutions 
even beyond those I had previously used in my professional practice. Overall, 
my experiences with Sierra caused me to search beyond the traditional 
recommendations for addressing the issue, to get creative with solutions, and 
to become very organized in my approach.</p> 
<p><strong><br>
 VS:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The book appears to be 
partly a workbook. Can you talk about that?</strong></p> 
<p><strong>NW:&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp; Because the problem of separation 
anxiety can seem so overwhelming, and because so much of the available 
information is very general, I wanted to give owners a way to formulate a plan 
for their own individual dog. The book begins by guiding the reader through a 
few simple exercises to determine whether their dog has true separation 
anxiety, is simply acting out of boredom, or has &ldquo;isolation 
distress,&rdquo; meaning they are fine as long as there is another warm body 
present. In subsequent chapters, owners are assisted in brainstorming 
management solutions and in creating an appropriate&nbsp; &ldquo;Alone 
Zone&rdquo; for their dog, and are given step-by-step assistance to formulate a 
customized treatment plan. Getting it all down on paper helps owners to feel 
less helpless and overwhelmed, and empowers them by creating a solid plan of 
action.</p> 
<p><strong><br>
 VS:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Along with useful exercises 
such as desensitizing the dog to departure cues, you offer a few different 
behavior modification protocols. Why not just one?</strong></p> 
<p><strong>NW:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because every dog is starting at a 
different point along the anxiety continuum. Some dogs become distressed when 
separated from their owner physically or visually&mdash;these are often the 
&ldquo;Velcro dogs&rdquo; who don&rsquo;t want to let the owner out of their 
sight, even for a minute! Then there are those who are fine so long as the 
owner is at home, but become anxious as soon as the owner prepares to leave. 
Other dogs don&rsquo;t become upset until the owner is actually gone. So there 
are different protocols to follow, depending on the particular dog.</p> 
<p><strong><br>
 VS:&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You also discuss complementary 
tools and therapies that may help. Can you discuss one or two?</strong></p> 
<p><strong>NW:&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; Leaving calming music playing when 
you are gone is one of the easiest ways to help your dog to relax. This goes 
beyond the old advice to leave a radio or television playing. Studies have 
shown that classical music, played with sparse instrumentation at a specific 
tempo, can have a calming effect on dogs. I recommend the<em>Through a 
Dog&rsquo;s Ear</em> CDs, which are psycho-acoustically designed specifically 
for this purpose&mdash;but the chapter also discusses how you can use classical 
music you have on hand.</p> 
<p>Another helpful modality is DAP, or Dog Appeasing Pheromone. This product 
chemically mimics the pheromones that are given off by a lactating female dog. 
In addition to being calming to puppies, it is also calming to adult dogs. The 
product looks like a plug-in air freshener, and you place it in your 
dog&rsquo;s main resting area. I&rsquo;ve had good success with DAP with some 
of my clients&rsquo; dogs. All of the things mentioned in this section, 
including the natural alternatives to pharmacological drugs, may help and 
won&rsquo;t cause harm. They are definitely worth trying, and should be done in 
conjunction with behavior modification.</p> 
<p><strong><br>
 VS:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition to helping 
owners, do you feel this book would be particularly helpful to shelters or 
rescue groups?</strong></p> 
<p><strong>NW:&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp; Absolutely! It&rsquo;s an 
unfortunate fact that some dogs who are rehomed will have separation issues. I 
offer deep discounts to shelters and rescue groups. Some organizations hand the 
books out to adopters of dogs with known separation issues, while others sell 
them, for example, in on-site humane society gift shops. This is an issue that 
is very close to my heart, and I want to do whatever I can to help. My hope is 
that the book will help dogs and their owners, and by doing so, keep dogs in 
their forever homes.</p> 
<p><strong>VS:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fantastic stuff &ndash; thanks so 
much, Nicole, and I&rsquo;ll see you in a couple of months!</strong></p>

<p>Dear Victoria:</p> 
<p>Our 2 yr old golden doodle has been diagnosed w/ OCD because she chases 
shadows constantly. She did not start this behavior until she was about a year 
old. We&rsquo;ve tried medications that have not worked, but what we really 
want is to know if this is something that training would help. She is very 
intelligent, but I don&rsquo;t know how to train her. We just do not have 
trainers available in Mississippi. We are desperate. When she is in 
&rdquo;shadow zone&rdquo; she&rsquo;s like a zombie. Please help.</p> 
<p>Thank you,<br>

<h3>Victoria&rsquo;s Interview with Italian VSPDT Giorgio</h3> Posted by 
Victoria Stilwell - 09/04/11 at 11:09:56 am -No Comments<br>

<p></p> 
<p>Il Cane Norma&rsquo;s Giorgio Guglielminotti Garmot is one of the first 
international members of Victoria&rsquo;s exclusive global network of 
world-class positive reinforcement trainers &ndash;Victoria Stilwell Positively 
Dog Training (VSPDT).&nbsp; We recently caught up with Giorgio to ask him about 
the movement towards positive reinforcement training in Italy, his training 
center outside of Rome, and his upcoming seminar featuring world-renowned 
ethologist Roger Abrantes in September.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;Leggi in italiano</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Victoria:</strong>&nbsp; How long have you been training dogs, and 
have you always used positive reinforcement<br>
 methods?<br>
<strong><br>
 
Giorgio:</strong> &nbsp;Are almost ten years now that I train dogs and I always 
used positive reinforcement methods; this is because my first formation was 
with the first dog trainer that used this method here in Italy: Carlo Marzoli. 
Of course I was already sure that we could approach dogs with different methods 
from those used so far.</p> 
<p><strong>VS:</strong>&nbsp; How prevalent are dominance-based, aversive 
training techniques and philosophies in Italy?&nbsp;&nbsp; Can you tell a 
difference in how progressive certain European countries are in their attitudes 
towards dogs compared to one another?<strong></strong></p> <strong> </strong> 
<p><strong>GG:</strong>&nbsp; In these recent years things are changing in 
Italy. There are many dog trainers class formation that reject dominance-based 
and aversive training techniques using positive reinforcement methods so the 
new trainer have a canine culture based on respect and on relationship with 
dogs. Unfortunately, there is still a culture based on old conception and on 
traditional knowledge that produce bad works with dog and no respect of the 
dog. In Europe I think we have great differences between certain countries: UK, 
France, and Nordic country (Sweden, Finland and Denmark) are maybe the best 
country about dog training with positive methods. I don&rsquo;t know a lot 
about Germany but the news I have are not so clear. Italy, Spain and Greece are 
growing up and maybe the majority problems we have are about the facilities for 
dogs like hospitality in Hotel, bar, restaurants, shops and public transport 
even if, during a my recent holidays in Spain, I had not problem to find many 
hotels that accept dogs.</p> 
<p><strong>VS:</strong>&nbsp; What made you decide to become a Victoria 
Stilwell Positively Dog Trainer, and how do you feel it sets you apart from 
other dog trainers in your area?<strong></strong></p> <strong> </strong> 
<p><strong>GG:</strong>&nbsp; The decision to become a VSPDT member was a sort 
of challenge with myself.&nbsp; After many years working I wanted to understand 
if my working methods could be at the same level of other international dog 
trainers.&nbsp; Of course have a better chance to disclose a good canine 
culture and be a member of an important association like this convinced me to 
try this experience.&nbsp; Many dog trainers in Italy know Victoria Stilwell 
and the &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Me or the Dog&rdquo; TV show and they are often 
surprised when I tell them about the VSPDT and my membership.&nbsp; They 
believe that it&rsquo;s too much difficult to reach, but I think that if we 
work in the right way we can reach great results.</p> 
<p><strong>VS:</strong>&nbsp; Tell us about your facility outside Rome, Il 
Cane a Norma.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s named after your own dog, right?&nbsp; What 
types of services do you offer and what message are you trying to convey to the 
local dog-owning public?<strong></strong></p> <strong> </strong> 
<p><strong>GG:</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;Yes, Il cane a Norma is sort of pun for my 
dog training center. My dog (Norma) changed my life and gave to me a job and a 
future many years ago so she deserved to give the name for my business. We 
offer base education and advanced training as obedience, rally-o, agility dog, 
nose works and discdog. More we help our customers to solve behavior problem of 
their dogs. We try to inform our public that there new methods to educate and 
train the dogs and that is better to begin immediately, with puppies, without 
waiting to have problems. Life with our dogs is long and it&rsquo;s should be a 
good life for both. Moreover we have class formation for new dog trainer and 
during the year we plan seminars and courses about specific dog activities.</p> 
<p><strong>VS:</strong>&nbsp; What is The Dog Trainers Company?<strong>
</strong></p> <strong> </strong> 
<p><strong>GG:</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;The Dog Trainers Company is a new company 
I have founded with the aim to provide professional service for the dog 
trainers in Italy. Seminars, events, technical equipments, workshops are the 
first goals for the DTC.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>VS:</strong>&nbsp; You&rsquo;re hosting renowned ethologist Roger 
Abrantes at your facility this September.&nbsp; Tell us a bit about him, why 
you decided to invite him to your first seminar, and what ethology is all about.
<strong></strong></p> <strong> </strong> 
<p><strong>GG:</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;Yes, our first guest will be Roger 
Abrantes, one of the most important person that studies animal behavior. PhD in 
Evolutionary Biology and Ethology, and BA in Philosophy, DHC, DF, MAPBC, born 
in Portugal in 1951, has lived most of his life in Denmark.He is the author to 
17 books in English, German, Spanish, Danish, Swedish, Norwegian, Italian, and 
Czech, and innumerous articles on behavior. He is probably one of the most 
versatile ethologists in the world. He has written popular books with sound 
advice to pet owners as well as theoretical scientific dissertations. He 
teaches ethology, anthropology, and epistemology (theory of knowledge), besides 
his practical work with dogs and horses.</p> 
<p>He is a popular guest in TV and radio programs in his home countries and in 
the US. His English books Dog Language&ndash;An Encyclopedia of Canine Behavior 
and The Evolution Of Canine Social Behavior became hits the moment they reached 
the US bookshelves. He lectures often in the US.</p> 
<p>Dr. Abrantes is especially known for his views on social behavior and its 
applications to the daily understanding of pet behavior; and for his 
no-nonsense working methods, a practical and thorough application of Ethology 
and Learning Theory, teaching the animal the new patterns patiently and 
efficiently step by step. In our seminar in Rome he will speak about SMAF 
(signal, meaning and form) his traning method and the second day he will 
present his last work about the dog behavior problems. Why Roger Abrantes? 
Because we think that Italy is ready to hear international experts and 
it&rsquo;s ready to learn from them.&nbsp;Download a PDF about Roger&rsquo;s 
Seminar at Il Cane Norma here.</p> 
<p><strong>VS:</strong>&nbsp; Giorgio, thanks so much for taking the time to 
chat with us today.&nbsp; I look forward to getting over to Italy very soon and 
joining forces with you in person to help spread the word that there&rsquo;s a 
better way to train&hellip; Positively &ndash; and that the concept of treating 
animals with the love, respect and trust that they deserve is a common language 
that we all share, regardless of nationality.</p>

<h3>Intervista di Vittoria con il Cane di Norma Giorgio Garmot</h3> Posted by 
Victoria Stilwell - 09/04/11 at 08:09:52 am -2 Comments<br>

<p></p> 
<p>Giorgio Guglielminotti Garmot, responsabile del centro cinofilo il cane a 
Norma, &egrave; uno dei primi membri internazionali della VSPDT, 
l&rsquo;associazione mondiale degli istruttori cinofili che utilizzano metodi 
non coercitivi nell&rsquo; educazione e nell&rsquo; addestramento del cane 
fondata da Victoria Stilwell. Abbiamo incontrato recentemente Giorgio e abbiamo 
parlato con lui su come sta cambiando in Italia il modo di relazionarsi col 
cane, sul suo centro cinofilo nelle vicinanze di Roma, e sull&rsquo;evento 
organizzato dalla nuova societ&agrave;, The Dog Trainers Company, che si 
terr&agrave; a Settembre sempre a Roma: il seminario del Prof. Roger Abrantes, 
etologo di fama mondiale.</p> 
<p>Leggi in inglese.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Victoria:</strong> Da quanto tempo ti occupi di educazione e 
addestramento del cane, e hai sempre usato il rinforzo positivo come metodo di 
apprendimento?</p> 
<p><strong>Giorgio:</strong> Sono ormai quasi dieci anni che lavoro con i cani 
e ho sempre usato metodi positivi con loro; questo perch&eacute; la mia 
formazione fu con una persona che molto probabilmente per prima in Italia aveva 
iniziato a proporsi al cane in modo positivo: Carlo Marzoli. Naturalmente 
decisi di seguire questa metodologia perch&eacute; fin dall&rsquo;epoca ero 
sicuro che potevamo insegnare al cane ci&ograve; che ci interessava con metodi 
diversi da quelli utilizzati in Italia sino a quel momento.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>VS:</strong> Quanto sono presenti in Italia metodi di addestramento 
basati sulla dominanza e su tecniche di coercizione? Puoi dirci qualcosa sulle 
differenze che si riscontrano nei diversi paesi in Europa e sui loro modi di 
proporsi al cane?</p> 
<p><strong>GG:</strong> In questi ultimi anni le cose in Italia stanno 
sicuramente cambiando. Ci sono molte scuole di formazione per istruttori 
cinofili che rifiutano categoricamente metodi coercitivi e l&rsquo;utilizzo 
della dominanza, questo fa si che tutti i nuovi professionisti divulghino una 
corretta cultura cinofila basata sul rispetto e sulla costruzione di una buona 
relazione col cane. Purtroppo esistono ancora realt&agrave; dove 
l&rsquo;utilizzo della violenza e della costrizione sul cane sono la 
normalit&agrave;. Credo che molto dipenda da vecchie conoscenze legate in 
qualche modo ad una tradizione e concezione antica del cane e ad una poca 
volont&agrave; di aggiornarsi e cambiare il proprio modo di lavoro. In Europa 
ritengo che esistono grandi differenze tra vari paesi su come viene inteso il 
cane e il suo rapporto con l&rsquo;uomo. Gran Bretagna, Francia, e Paesi 
Nordici (Svezia, Finlandia e Danimarca) sono forse tra i migliori paesi in 
Europa riguardo l&rsquo;utilizzo del metodo positivo per l&rsquo;addestramento 
del cane. Non so molto per quello che riguarda la Germania ma le poche 
esperienze avute in quel paese e le notizie che arrivano sono spesso 
contrastanti. Italia, Spagna e Grecia stanno crescendo e stanno migliorando la 
loro posizione e forse il maggiore problema che si riscontra &egrave; nei 
servizi offerti ai cani. Risulta molto difficile trovare Hotel, bar, 
ristoranti, negozi e mezzi di trasporto che accettano cani, anche se, durante 
una mia recente vacanza in Spagna con i miei cani, non ho avuto grossi problemi 
nel trovare strutture che li accettassero.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>VS:</strong> Cosa ti ha fatto decidere di diventare un membro della 
VSPDT e cosa pensano i tuoi colleghi di lavoro in Italia?</p> 
<p><strong>GG:</strong> E&rsquo; stata una specie di sfida con me stesso. Dopo 
molti anni di lavoro volevo capire se la mia preparazione poteva essere messa 
in confronto con istruttori internazionali di alto livello. Naturalmente avere 
la possibilit&agrave; di divulgare nel miglior modo una corretta cultura 
cinofila ed essere membro di una associazione cos&igrave; importante mi hanno 
spinto a provare questa esperienza. Molti istruttori cinofili in Italia 
conoscono Victoria Stilwell e il suo programma televisivo &ldquo;Basta, o io o 
il cane&rdquo; e spesso sono rimangono molto stupiti quando racconto la mia 
esperienza con la VSPDT. Questo perch&eacute; pensano che sia troppo difficile 
da intraprendere ma io sono convinto che quando si lavora bene qualsiasi 
risultato &egrave; raggiungibile.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>VS:</strong> Raccontaci qualcosa sul tuo centro cinofilo, prende il 
nome dal tuo cane vero? Che tipo di servizi offri e qual&rsquo; &egrave; il 
messaggio che vuoi portare ai tuoi clienti?</p> 
<p><strong>GG:</strong> Si, esatto. Il cane a Norma &egrave; un gioco di 
parole creato col nome del mio cane. Norma ha cambiato la mia vita, mi ha dato 
un lavoro e un futuro e il minimo che potessi fare era dedicargli il centro 
cinofilo. Come prima cosa ci occupiamo di educazione di base e di addestramento 
avanzato come obedience, rally-o, agility dog, lavori olfattivi e discdog. 
Aiutiamo inoltre i nostri clienti a risolvere i problemi comportamentali dei 
loro cani. Ci&ograve; che proviamo a fare &egrave; specialmente far capire ai 
proprietari che esistono nuovi metodi per educare i cani e per insegnare loro i 
diversi esercizi e che naturalmente &egrave; meglio iniziare il prima 
possibile&hellip;.. con il cucciolo, senza aspettare di avere problemi. La vita 
insieme al nostro cane &egrave; lunga e dovrebbe essere vissuta nel miglior 
modo per tutti.</p> 
<p>Infine presso il nostro centro ci occupiamo di formazione con corsi per chi 
vuole intraprendere questa professione e durante l&rsquo;anno organizziamo 
seminari e stages su attivit&agrave; specifiche con i cani.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Che cos&rsquo;&egrave; la Dog Trainers Company? La Dog Trainers Company 
&egrave; una nuova societ&agrave; che ho fondato insieme ad alcuni amici e 
colleghi che ha lo scopo di proporre servizi professionali agli istruttori 
cinofili. Eventi, stages, seminari, materiale tecnico e altre iniziative sono i 
primi obiettivi che la DTC si propone.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>VS:</strong> Ospiterete l&rsquo;etologo di fama mondiale mondiale 
nel seminario di Settembre: raccontaci qualcosa su di lui e perch&eacute; avete 
deciso di invitarlo al vostro primo evento.</p> 
<p><strong>GG:</strong> Si, il nostro primo ospite sar&agrave; Roger Abrantes, 
uno dei maggiori studiosi del comportamento animale. Etologo e laureato 
biologia dell&rsquo;evoluzione &egrave; nato in Portogallo e ha vissuto gran 
parte della sua vita in Danimarca. E&rsquo; autore di 17 libri in diverse 
lingue quali inglese, tedesco, spagnolo, danese, svedese, norvegese, italiano e 
ceco e ha pubblicato diversi articoli sul comportamento animale. Insegna 
etologia, antropologia e teoria dell&rsquo;apprendimento, il tutto correlato 
dal lavoro pratico con cani e cavalli. E&rsquo; un ospite popolare in programmi 
televisivi e radiofonici. Il suo libro pi&ugrave; importante, &ldquo;il 
linguaggio del cane&rdquo;, &egrave; sicuramente un testo che non pu&ograve; 
mancare nella formazione di un istruttore cinofilo. E&rsquo; particolarmente 
conosciuto per il suo pensiero sul comportamento sociale e per il suo metodo di 
apprendimento sviluppato negli anni conosciuto come SMAF (signal, meaning and 
form). Nel nostro seminario parler&agrave; proprio dello SMAF e nel secondo 
giorno presenter&agrave; il suo ultimo lavoro sui problemi comportamentali del 
cane. Perch&eacute; abbiamo invitato proprio lui? Perch&eacute; pensiamo che 
l&rsquo;Italia adesso &egrave; pronta per ascoltare esperti internazionali ed 
&egrave; pronta ad imparare da loro. E&rsquo; solo il primo, ne seguiranno 
altri e tutti molto importanti.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>VS:</strong> &nbsp;Giorgio, grazie per aver parlato con noi oggi. 
Mi sto preparando per venire in Italia molto presto e unire le mie forze con le 
tue per dire al mondo che c&rsquo;&egrave; un modo migliore per 
addestrare&hellip;&hellip;. Il metodo Positivo - e che l&rsquo;idea di trattare 
gli animali con amore, rispetto e fiducia &egrave; un linguaggio comune che 
tutti dovrebbero condividere indipendentemente dalla nazionalit&agrave;.</p>

<p>Hi Victoria!<br>
 I love your show!&nbsp; I have two mini Australian 
shepherds.&nbsp; My female Alice was rescued from a puppy mill.&nbsp; She is 
very territorial when it comes to men.&nbsp; The second a man comes near her 
she begins barking non-stop.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve tried my command leave it, 
ignoring her, giving men treats to entice her, but nothing has worked!&nbsp; 
How do I get her to be more comfortable around men?&nbsp; Any advice would be 
much appreciated!&nbsp; Thank you!</p> 
<p><strong>Lauren from Norman, OK</strong><br>

<h3>Victoria Chats With Patricia McConnell</h3> Posted by Victoria Stilwell -

<p></p> 
<p><strong><em>LOVE HAS NO AGE LIMIT</em></strong></p> 
<p>I recently had the chance to catch up with my friend and dog training guru 
Dr. Patricia McConnell to chat about her latest book,Love Has No Age Limit
.&nbsp; Love this woman and what she does!</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Victoria With Dr. Patricia McConnell</p> 
<p></p> 
<p><strong>Victoria Stilwell:&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong> Hi Patricia!&nbsp; So glad 
you could find a few minutes to talk to me about your new book (which I love, 
by the way.)&nbsp; As you know, you have been a huge influence on me as a dog 
trainer and I&rsquo;m honored to be able to talk dog with you!</p> 
<p><strong>Patricia McConnell:&nbsp;</strong> The honor is all mine, Victoria, 
it&rsquo;s a joy to talk to someone who has done so much to promote humane (and 
effective!) dog training.</p> 
<p><strong></strong><strong>VS:</strong>&nbsp; Why did you and your co-author, 
Karen London, decide to write<em>Love Has No Age Limit?</em></p> 
<p><strong>PM:</strong>&nbsp; We wrote the book to both encourage adoptions 
and, as importantly, to increase the percentage of successful ones. We&rsquo;ve 
both had many clients over the years who adopted dogs from shelters and rescues 
who needed some guidance about how to transition their adopted dog from 
&ldquo;new dog&rdquo; to &ldquo;best dog ever.&rdquo;</p> 
<p><strong></strong><strong>VS:</strong>&nbsp; Have you found that dogs from 
shelters or rescue groups have a special set of problems that need to be 
addressed?</p> 
<p><strong></strong><strong>PM:</strong>&nbsp; In some ways, no. We&rsquo;ve 
met (and adopted!) so many adolescent and adult dogs who were great dogs, 
really fantastic ones. However, it IS a bit different bringing home a dog who 
is not a puppy anymore, and it helps to have one&rsquo;s expectations aligned 
with reality.</p> 
<p><strong>VS:</strong>&nbsp; What have you found are the primary differences 
between bringing home a young puppy versus adopting a dog who is a bit older?
</p> 
<p><strong>PM:&nbsp;</strong> One important thing to keep in mind is that a 
dog who is &ldquo;house trained&rdquo; in one home doesn&rsquo;t necessarily 
transfer that behavior to your home. Even well-trained, older dogs need to be 
watched carefully for the first few days so that they understand where to find 
the restroom. Take them out often and give them treats for relieving themselves 
outside so that they catch on before they establish a bad habit.</p> 
<p>Another important tip is to remember that once a dog is no longer a puppy 
he or she doesn&rsquo;t have an automatic &ldquo;following&rdquo; response. Too 
often adopters bring home a dog and expect it to jump out of the car and follow 
them into the house. We advise being</p> 
<p>extremely cautious at first when you bring home a new dog: be sure the 
leash is on and in your hand before the dog leaves the car, and don&rsquo;t 
assume that, if you have one,&nbsp; your backyard fence is 
&ldquo;dog-proof&rdquo; without doing a careful check before you let the dog 
loose in it.</p> 
<p>And overwhelmingly, the most important attribute to making an adoption work 
is to be patient! Just as puppies need months or years to learn the rules of 
the house, remember that your new dog needs time to get to know you and to 
settle in and feel at home. He or she also needs the humane and effective kind 
of training that you role model Victoria, to be a polite member of the family. 
Just because a dog isn&rsquo;t a puppy doesn&rsquo;t mean it doesn&rsquo;t need 
to learn what you expect of it.</p> 
<p><strong>VS:</strong>&nbsp; Some people have told me that they are resistant 
to adopting a dog from a shelter or humane society because the dog must have 
something wrong with it. Do dogs from shelters have more behavioral problems 
than other dogs?</p> 
<p><strong>PM:&nbsp;</strong> Absolutely not. That doesn&rsquo;t mean that 
every dog who needs a home is perfect, but there are so many wonderful dogs out 
there looking for homes. It&rsquo;s true that they&rsquo;ll need training and 
guidance to learn to fit into your household, but one of my best dogs ever came 
from a shelter, the one I renamed Lassie because she was the dog everyone wants 
but doesn&rsquo;t deserve!</p> 
<p><strong></strong><strong>VS:</strong>&nbsp; It certainly is a fantastic 
book, but I know that most shelters and rescue groups are strapped for money. 
Can they afford to give it out to adopters?</p> 
<p><strong>PM:</strong>&nbsp; We worked very hard to create a book that is 
priced far, far below the usual retail cost for a book its size, so that 
shelters and rescue groups could afford to give it out with every dog they 
adopt. That&rsquo;s been super successful --- a Golden Retriever rescue group 
(GRIN) in Ohio bought 500, and we&rsquo;ve heard from lots of people who are 
buying multiple copies and donating them to their shelter. We want to do all 
that we can to help find homeless dogs their forever homes!</p> 
<p><strong>VS:</strong>&nbsp; Fantastic.&nbsp; Thanks so much, Patricia, and 
best of luck with the new book &ndash; it certainly is a valuable addition to 
your terrific catalog.&nbsp; See you soon!</p>

<h3>Hero Dog Treasure &ndash; Cochranville, PA</h3> Posted by Victoria 
Stilwell - 07/24/11 at 06:07:27 am -2 Comments<br>

<p></p> 
<p>Treasure has overcome adversity in her own life ... She was born both blind 
and deaf. She has known the sting of loneliness while waiting in a shelter for 
someone to notice her. She has known what it is like to be rejected and 
unwanted. Perhaps this is what makes her so good at her job. People can relate 
to her in some way. They hear her story and it touches a place in their hearts. 
They can recognize on some level a part of what she's been through.</p> 
<p>You see, Treasure is a therapy dog. She is now loved and cherished for the 
role she has both in her own family, and in the hearts of others. Treasure 
visits people who are hoping for a friend. She shows no judgment. She loves to 
be touched and is just the right size to snuggle into a lap. Treasure visits 
people who can relate to her. When one woman living at an assisted living 
facility found out that Treasure couldn't see or hear her, she stated 
cheerfully, &quot;Well, that's ok. I can't always see or hear that well 
myself.&quot; Her focus was not on what Treasure couldn't do, but on what they 
had in common and how that made them each special.</p> 
<p>Treasure has a way of inspiring all those who meet her, but what she does 
best is to provide a welcome friend in a sometimes lonely world. To many, she 
is a hero every day.</p> 
<p>Voting is now open for the Hero Dog Awards!</p>

<h3>Victoria Chats With Italian VSPDT Daniela Cardillo</h3> Posted by Victoria 
Stilwell - 07/23/11 at 12:07:14 pm -3 Comments<br>

<p></p> 
<p>Greendogs&rsquo; Daniela Cardillo is among the first international members 
of Victoria&rsquo;s exclusive global network of world-class positive 
reinforcement trainers &ndash; Victoria Stilwell Positively Dog Training (VSPDT
).&nbsp; &nbsp;I recently caught up with Daniela to ask her about the movement 
towards positive reinforcement training in Italy, and her training business 
near Milan.</p> 
<p>Leggi in italiano</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Victoria:&nbsp; </strong>How long have you been training dogs, and 
have you always used positive reinforcement methods?</p> 
<p><strong>Daniela:</strong>&nbsp; I was a teenager when I had my first own 
dog and I immediately felt the need to buy my first training book in 1983 
&ldquo;complete guide for German Sheppard training&ldquo; . But I learned and 
used for the first time the positive reinforcement method in San Francisco CA 
in 1991, training a rescued greyhound. &nbsp;I was teaching the dog to 
&ldquo;come when called&rdquo; and I used food as the positive reinforcer. 
After only a few days, I decided not to use food anymore because the dog had 
learned how to come back to me&hellip; and I lost the dog for one hour.&nbsp; 
In Golden Gate Park!&nbsp; This is a common mistake that almost every person 
makes when first using positive reinforcement method.&nbsp; My clients also 
make this mistake within the 5th lesson.&nbsp; Then I tell them that positive 
reinforcement is used for two goals: teaching the behavior and MOTIVATING the 
behavior!&nbsp; My Greyhound knew how to come back when called&hellip;but 
simply didn&rsquo;t want to do it for nothing (no motivation). She had 
something nicer to do, somewhere else in the Park, that better called for her 
attention!!</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>VS:</strong>&nbsp; How prevalent are dominance-based, aversive 
training techniques and philosophies in Italy?</p> 
<p><strong>DC:</strong>&nbsp; In Italy is prohibited to use electric/shock 
collars but I still see and hear about aversive training and dominance-based 
techniques.&nbsp; For example many &ldquo;dog trainers&rdquo; still use choke 
chains to teach the dog not to pull on leash and tie the dog till he 
can&rsquo;t even breath.&nbsp; The first thing I do with my customers that use 
choke chains is to remove it and take a harness from my bag.&nbsp; Just to 
start.&nbsp; I work to promote more science-based dog-learning, dog-language, 
positive reinforcement training.&nbsp; For this reason I am also organizing a
FIDO FESTIVAL called &ldquo;QUA LA ZAMPA&rdquo; in Barzio (Lecco &ndash; Italy) 
the 14th of August. It&rsquo;s a full-day DOG festival with many scheduled 
events of culture and education throughout the day. We will talk about 
conscious adoption of dogs, slaughter in the &ldquo;perreras&quot; 
(Spain&rsquo;s kennels), &nbsp;how to recognize heatstroke and how to handle 
it, the best dog-equipment to use when training and for everyday life, we will 
have a group training of exercises using positive reinforcement methods and 
lastly we will have a dog parade!&nbsp; (More details on
www.daniela.cardillo.positively.com )</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>VS:</strong> &nbsp;Can you tell a difference in how progressive 
certain European countries are in their attitudes towards dogs compared to one 
another?</p> 
<p><strong>DC:</strong>&nbsp; Looking at Europe from the Italian point of 
view, it seems that England is the guideline for dog training in real life and 
dogs are really welcome everywhere also in the tourist reception.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
In some countries like Spain, the law allows terrifying things: dogs that are 
in shelters are killed after 10 days if not requested from old owners or from a 
new family. When they are put in the dead-list, no food, no water, no care a 
all is given to them and then they are killed with NO regulations&hellip; i.e. 
in the incinerator still alive! And many many other terrifying things like 
this. I&rsquo;m personally involved to help those dogs in the 
&ldquo;perreras&rdquo; and the FIDO FESTIVAL &ldquo;QUA LA ZAMPA&rdquo; is to 
economically support these dogs.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>VS:</strong>&nbsp; What made you decide to become a Victoria 
Stilwell Positively Dog Trainer, and how do you feel it sets you apart from 
other dog trainers in your area?</p> 
<p><strong>DC:</strong>&nbsp; I decided to become a Victoria Stilwell 
Positively Dog Trainer because I share the philosophy of positive reinforcement 
method and I want to share with you, Victoria, and your worldwide team, the 
goal of offering the best (ethically and technically) for family dogs, rescued 
dogs, shelter dogs&hellip; and their lives.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m proud to be part of 
your Team and I&rsquo;m ready to help dogs and their families with positive 
reinforcement training&hellip; for a better (dog)world.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>VS:</strong>&nbsp; Tell us about your facility outside Milan, 
Greendogs.&nbsp; How did you come up with that name, what types of services do 
you offer and what message are you trying to convey to the local dog-owning 
public?</p> 
<p><strong>DC:</strong>&nbsp; The name &ldquo;Greendogs&rdquo; comes from the 
traffic light! Red you stop, Green you go!</p> 
<p>My goal is to let dogs be: be free to be dogs, good dogs with no problem, 
safe dogs, friendly dogs, happy dogs, so&hellip;GREENDOGS are dogs that can go 
everywhere with no problem at all!&nbsp; I work in the Lecco, Brianza and 
Milano area exactly as you do in your TV program: I work in the house of the 
families, understand the problem from the human point of view and then from the 
dogs&rsquo; point of view. Then I make a schedule of number and type of 
sessions to do, write the goals end start with new rules and training exercises.
</p> 
<p>The families I work with, are mostly &ldquo;distressed&rdquo; for the 
problems directly and indirectly caused by their dogs&hellip; and too many 
times I&rsquo;m the last chance for these dogs&hellip; So, an important job in 
my opinion!&nbsp; I also work for puppy training, as a prevention to 
dog&rsquo;s behavior problems&hellip; and a good education of the owners! if I 
don&rsquo;t see my puppy-customers anymore&hellip;it means that I have done a 
great job with them!!&nbsp; The message I want to give to the local dog-owning 
public is knowledge about the dogs, organizing theFido Festival, training, 
seminars for learning dogs&rsquo; language, for a growing dog-culture.</p> 
<p><strong>Important appointment scheduled with Giorgio Guglielminotti (VSPDT) 
is a scientific seminar that will be held in Rome the 17th &ndash; 18th 
September 2011 with Roger Abrantes. This seminar is designed for dog trainers (
</strong><strong>www.greendogs.it</strong><strong> for details).</strong></p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>VS:</strong>&nbsp; Daniela, thanks so much for taking the time to 
chat with us today.&nbsp; I look forward to getting over to Italy very soon and 
joining forces with you and Giorgio in person to help spread the word that 
there&rsquo;s a better way to train&hellip; Positively &ndash; and that the 
concept of treating animals with the love, respect and trust that they deserve 
is a common language that we all share, regardless of nationality.</p>

<h3>My Work With Rin Tin Tin!</h3> Posted by Victoria Stilwell - 07/22/11 at 
07:07:34 am -11 Comments<br>

<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Me with Rin Tin Tin</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Just before I went to New York to start filming the new season of It's Me 
or the Dog, I had the great pleasure of being invited to Little Rock, Arkansas 
to meet the legendary Rin Tin Tin.&nbsp; What an honor!&nbsp; Rin and I have 
both recently come on board as National Ambassadors for theAmerican Humane 
Association, so I'll be seeing more of him at various upcoming events, 
including a special tribute gala to the amazing service dogs who helped so many 
in the days after 9/11 (search and rescue, therapy dogs, etc).&nbsp; Read more 
about this special event here.</p> 
<p>Like most people, I knew that Rin Tin Tin rose to fame thanks to his 
prolific work in Hollywood during the first half of the 20th century, but I 
wasn't fully aware of the amazing story about how he came to the US as a 
rescued, shellshocked pup from France during World War I.&nbsp; I also didn't 
know that the current and previous Rin Tin Tins (there have been 12 so far) 
have a history as service dogs tending to children in need.</p> 
<p>But the main reason for my trip to Little Rock was not to meet this Rin Tin 
Tin, but rather the future heir to the famous name.&nbsp; The current Rin 
(pictured here) is a beautiful dog and a great ambassador for the German 
Shepherd breed.&nbsp; The quality and integrity of this line of dogs is a 
testament to what reputable breeding should be.&nbsp; As most of you know, I'm 
a passionate advocate for rescuing animals from shelters, and am firmly against 
puppy mills, backyard breeders and anyone who breeds dogs with no regard for 
health, temperament and the animals' well-being.&nbsp; But the family who is 
responsible for the Rin Tin Tin line are great examples of how to do it right, 
and they've produced very happy, healthy, well-adjusted dogs that all end up in 
loving forever homes.&nbsp; You can see archived video of the most recent litter
here.</p> 
<p>So I've been asked to work with and be responsible for the training of the 
future Rin Tin Tin, who is now a 9-week old puppy destined for further 
fame.&nbsp;&nbsp; I spent some quality time reconnecting with the lovely puppy 
and his owner, setting up overall training protocols so that he can be as 
successful as possible.&nbsp; I'll post more about that process, my time 
working with this lovely little chap and the line's fascinating personal 
history later.</p> 
<p>For now, though, congratulations to Chivon Winter, the winner of the recent 
contest who correctly guessed the identity of my new little friend and was 
chosen at random from the many correct entries!</p> 
<p>Stay tuned for more info about my work with Rin Tin Tin! </p> <br>

<h3>Hero Dog Phoenix &ndash; Hopewell Junction, NY</h3> Posted by Victoria 
Stilwell - 07/11/11 at 12:07:29 pm -2 Comments<br>

<p></p> 
<p>This is Phoenix. At a young age (7 months), Phoenix was involved in a 
terrible accident that severely injured his right hind leg.</p> 
<p>Read his heartwarming story as told by his lucky owner:</p> 
<p>Shortly after his accident, and during the period the veterinarians tried 
to save his leg, Phoenix came into my life. Ironically, he appeared at a time 
when I too was dealing with some rough, heart-ache issues. Although our pains 
were different, we went through them together. I have never seen a dog face 
such adversity, discomfort and complications with the grace, gentleness, trust 
and strength he did. His veterinarians and vet techs can attest to his 
endurance. After many surgeries and painful procedures, Phoenix suffered one 
final complication which caused his leg to re-fracture. He handled his 
amputation with courage and perseverance.</p> 
<p>I learned many things while watching Phoenix face and meet his challenges 
including a special kind of love that is pure and true. Anyone that has met 
Phoenix along the way has also experienced the kindness and love that he 
exudes. Strangers, even from a distance, feel the need to meet and pet him. I 
knew I would never be able to keep all of this sweetness and love to myself and 
therefore we joined a wonderful organization called Good Dog Foundation. 
Through Good Dog Foundation, Phoenix and I have been able to go into our local 
VA Hospital to share happiness, love and thank these wonderful men and women 
who have served our country. Phoenix has also recently started work in a local 
library reading program, where children read aloud to him, show pictures, or 
just talk and pet him. He LOVES it!! Phoenix is a special pup that has taught 
and shared his love, trust and strength. He will always be a hero in my eyes.

<h3>Dealing With Fireworks Anxiety</h3> Posted by Victoria Stilwell - 07/01/11 
at 08:07:52 pm -28 Comments<br>

<p></p> 
<p>Here comes the big one!</p> 
<p>As the 4th of July approaches in the US, I&rsquo;ve been getting tons of 
emails from people asking how to deal with dogs (and cats) that are terrified 
of fireworks.&nbsp; Like early November in the UK (Guy Fawkes Night) and New 
Year&rsquo;s Eve everywhere, Independence Day can be a fantastic time for us 
humans, but while we gather with friends and family to celebrate and kick back, 
these times of year can be miserable for our pets.</p> 
<p>A lot of your dog&rsquo;s misery can be avoided (or at least reduced) if 
you think ahead and begin the desensitization process with her well ahead of 
the big day.&nbsp; There are several steps you should take if you think your 
dog will have a bad reaction to the booms, whistles and pops that are the 
soundtrack to what the rest of us all consider a fun night.</p> 
<p>Working with dogs that have a fear or phobia can be complex because even 
though some common fears can be successfully worked with, others are deeply 
ingrained and are therefore highly resistant to change.&nbsp; Recent reports 
have shown that 93% of dogs with noise phobias involved fear of thunder and 
other loud noises, including fireworks. Whether fear of fireworks is elicited 
by a singular traumatic experience or prolonged exposure, the result is often 
highly distressing for dogs and owners.&nbsp; Without extensive behavioural 
therapy and management strategies, phobias become deeply ingrained and even 
harder to change.</p> 
<p>Unfortunately even one noisy celebration can turn a dog into a quivering 
wreck.&nbsp; Some dogs are so badly affected that they have an inability to 
function during and after a fireworks show.&nbsp; Many fireworks-phobic dogs 
adopt self-management strategies in order to cope.&nbsp; These strategies 
include attempting to escape the home, digging into carpets, seeking out dark 
den-like spaces to hide in, or crawling behind a bathroom sink or toilet.&nbsp; 
Others will pace back and forth during the episode, unable to focus on owners 
who are desperately attempting to calm them down.&nbsp; Stress is also 
manifested through excessive panting, pupil dilation, sweating paws, raised 
heartbeat, loss of appetite, whimpering, trembling and an inability to settle.
</p> 
<p>One thing that can sometimes make behavioral modification in fireworks 
cases a bit easier than with thunderstorms is that thunderstorms are not easy 
to predict or control.&nbsp; A dog usually knows that a storm is coming long 
before an owner and becomes increasingly panicked as the storm 
approaches.&nbsp; Regardless, as with all training techniques, I have learned 
that treating every dog as an individual is of utmost importance and that 
modification and management is more likely to succeed if time is spent 
tailoring the training to each specific dog.</p> 
<p>Conditioning a dog to feel differently about the sound of fireworks can be 
achieved by gradually exposing the dog to audio recordings of fireworks at low 
volume levels and, if the dog appears relaxed, playing his favorite game or 
feeding him his favorite food.&nbsp; Allowing the dog to play and relax in the 
presence of the soft noise for a period of ten minutes, taking a break of five 
minutes and repeating the exercise ensures that the dog doesn&rsquo;t become 
bored with the training. Introducing the audio at a low level again and slowly 
turning up the volume if the dog continues to be relaxed and able to 
concentrate on playing the game or eating the food allows the dog to habituate 
to the noise without a fear response.&nbsp; If the dog shows signs of stress, 
going back to the previous level and building up the noise level again will 
take pressure off the dog.&nbsp; The object of noise desensitization is to 
gradually expose the dog to louder and louder sounds over a period of time, 
progress being determined by the dog&rsquo;s reactions.&nbsp; Going too fast 
might make the dog even more frightened, so taking things slowly will ensure 
maximum benefit from the process.</p> 
<p>Gradually exposing the dog to flashes of light that grow in intensity can 
be another part of therapy, but one that can be harder to implement.&nbsp; I 
have found that these therapies are often not as effective as noise 
desensitization.&nbsp; Some dogs will respond well to all of the above 
therapies, but will become panicked when the real fireworks start.&nbsp; It is 
therefore important to tackle this phobia in other ways by using effective 
management strategies and by masking any audio and visual stimuli that elicit a 
fear response during an episode.</p> 
<p>The most important thing an owner can do for their fireworks-phobic dog is 
to provide them with a bolt hole &ndash; a place where the dog can escape to 
when the festivities begin.&nbsp; Providing the dog access to this safe place 
is essential at all times, particularly during an owner&rsquo;s absence.&nbsp; 
This might be a closet, bathroom or a basement, the best places usually being 
the ones that have no windows, but with plenty of artificial light (to mask 
flashes of fireworks).&nbsp; Music can be played close to the safe haven so 
that sounds can be masked.&nbsp; It is also essential that if an owner is 
present, time be spent with the dog in the safe haven or attention given to the 
dog if it comes to seek comfort from its owner.&nbsp; Far from reinforcing 
fearful behaviour, an owner&rsquo;s comforting arm and presence can help a 
phobic dog to cope as long as the owner remains calm at all times.</p> 
<p>Some phobic dogs benefit from calming therapies such as t-touch, 
Thundershirts, DAP collars, and Bach Flower Essences, while others do much 
better on anti-anxiety medication that can be given just before the fireworks 
start.&nbsp; It is vital, however, &nbsp;that behavioral therapy and management 
are always given along with any medications in order to give the dog the best 
possible chance of rehabilitation.</p> 
<p>I&rsquo;m very excited about some pretty groundbreaking work that 
I&rsquo;ve been doing lately on a project to help dogs with phobias like these, 
and I hope to be able to announce something about that soon.&nbsp; In the 
meantime, fireworks phobia can be a tough condition to treat, but trying a

<h3>No Jumping</h3> Posted by Victoria Stilwell - 07/01/11 at 08:07:52 pm - 10 
Comments<br>

<p></p> 
<p>Dogs jump for many reasons. Don&rsquo;t we like to see people&rsquo;s faces 
when we say hello? Jumping while greeting is a great way for a dog to get your 
attention. Some dogs will jump from sheer excitement. Ever feel so excited that 
you just want to leap around? Excitement produces physical energy and this 
energy has to go somewhere. On the other side of the coin &ndash; some dogs 
will jump because they feel uneasy when someone comes into the house. Jumping 
becomes a controlling/coping mechanism that allows the dog to deal with the new 
intrusion.</p> 
<p>There are a number of ways you can control your dog&rsquo;s jumping.</p> 
<ul> 
<li>If your dog is jumping from pure excitement then it is wise to manage your 
environment by not allowing the dog to greet people when they first come 
through the door. Keep your dog behind a baby gate and don&rsquo;t allow him to 
greet until he is calm.</li> 
<li>Be consistent. Don&rsquo;t allow the dog to jump up on you when greeting 
and expect him not to jump up on guests when they come into the house. Mixed 
messages are confusing and unfair.</li> 
<li>An effective way to stop some dogs from jumping up is to ignore them while 
they are jumping. Each time the dog jumps up at you &ndash; turn your back. 
Don&rsquo;t look, talk or touch the dog at any time it is trying to jump. Fold 
your arms in front and be boring. When he stops jumping wait for four seconds 
of four paws on the floor then reward this with your attention in a calm 
manner. If your dog jumps again, repeat. Sometimes the dog jumps harder and 
higher to get your attention. This is known as an extinction burst. What has 
worked before is no longer getting attention so the dog tries harder. Be 
persistent because eventually he will give up! Remember ignore the crazy and 
reward the calm.</li> 
<li>One of the best ways you can teach a dog or dogs not to jump, especially 
when people come through the front door, is to teach them to do something else 
instead of the jumping behavior. The energy has to go somewhere, so if it can 
be redirected into another behavior such as teaching the dogs to go to a mat or 
area and stay there until guests have entered and everyone has calmed down, 
then allow them to greet in a calm manner, this still allows the dogs to expend 
energy, but in a controlled way.</li> 
<li>If your dog is unconfident around guests and jumps to be controlling, do 
not allow your dog to greet your guests. Put him in a place where he can be 
calm and confident. When guests are seated allow your dog to come in and say 
hello. If your dog is aggressive in any way to strangers it is your primary 
responsibility to keep your guests safe. If this means your dog is away while 
guests are in your home, so be it. You will have a happier dog and happier 
guests.</li> </ul>

<p></p> 
<p>Toby is a 6-year old Yorkshire Terrier, a 7-pound bundle of joy with a 
wonderful temperament, who truly loves giving to others. He exemplifies the 
true meaning unconditional love.</p> 
<p>For two years Toby has been a registered therapy dog, regularly visiting 
children at Cedars Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles. As we reach the hospital, 
Toby is so eager to begin that he literally drags me up the stairs. Whenever 
Toby enters the room, the faces of the children and their families light up. 
Parents often say this was the first time their child smiled since entering the 
hospital.</p> 
<p>Toby snuggles carefully in cribs and beds. He seems to know intuitively 
where a child hurts and finds an appropriate place to cuddle. Children who are 
in and out of the hospital bond with Toby during their repeated visits. One 
little boy was too sick to lift his head, but when he saw us enter the room, he 
said, &ldquo;Toby, you made my Christmas!&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Voting is now open for the Hero Dog Awards!</p> 
<p>You can vote for Toby here, or any of the other amazing hero dogs. </p> <br>
<h3>The Bully</h3> Posted by Victoria Stilwell - 06/23/11 at 10:06:21 am - 56

<p></p> 
<p>Riding horses as a 6 year-old.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>As I watch my daughter and my nieces grow up, I am continually reminded of 
all the situations kids have to deal with when it comes to establishing and 
keeping social relationships with their peers.&nbsp; Friendships come and go, 
best friends change like the wind and the emotional roller coaster that this 
causes can be hard to watch, especially when it happens to your child or other 
kids that you are close to.&nbsp; &nbsp;I make sure the kids know that if they 
ever have an issue or concern, they can talk to me and/or go to a teacher that 
they trust.&nbsp; It is so important to teach children to communicate their 
feelings and if I had been taught that lesson when I was young, maybe I would 
have avoided (or at least been able to mitigate) events that led to the worst 
two years of my young life.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
<p>I was a happy, outgoing child &ndash; relatively confident and able to 
fight my own battles.&nbsp; I was bullied a little when I was growing up and 
even though I still remember incidences from when I was 7 years old, I was able 
to come through the experience relatively easily.&nbsp; It was only when I 
turned 13 that I experienced a level of bullying that turned my world upside 
down and plunged me into a nightmare that I thought I would never get out 
of.&nbsp;&nbsp; It all started because of one girl.&nbsp; I won&rsquo;t name 
her, but I remember everything about her, from what she looked like, to what 
she wore, to how she spoke.&nbsp; She bullied me relentlessly for two years and 
made my life a misery.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And it all started because of 
jealousy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
<p>My bully loved to be the centre of attention.&nbsp; Even though we went to 
an all girls&rsquo; school, she had a big following of both girls and boys who 
flocked around her like flies on feces.&nbsp;&nbsp; She was in the year above 
me at school and I had nothing to do with her until one of her friends, who 
happened to be a boy, told her that he liked me.&nbsp; I suppose I should have 
been flattered, but I was blissfully unaware of this, until the bully started 
to make fun of me and say nasty comments as I walked past her in the school 
hallways.&nbsp; I couldn&rsquo;t understand why she was being so nasty and 
wondered what I had done to offend her.&nbsp;</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Dogs and Wimbledon Common - a great combination.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>The boys who attended our brother school would finish school before we did 
and hang around outside our school until we got out.&nbsp; It was a great 
social scene and because most of us either walked or cycled to school, we would 
meet, ride our bikes up to Wimbledon common, and hang out by the pond for an 
hour before we went home.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We always had a great time and 
there were never any issues, except for a few broken hearts here and 
there.&nbsp; We enjoyed a freedom that a lot of kids don&rsquo;t get and we 
were generally well-behaved, save for the odd sneaked puff of a cigarette when 
we could get our hands on one. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>I was not a particularly &lsquo;cool&rsquo; teenager.&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t 
wear great clothes, I didn&rsquo;t wear make-up and I wasn&rsquo;t self 
aware.&nbsp; I loved acting, walking dogs, riding horses and cycling with my 
best friend Kate and that was all I really needed to be happy.&nbsp; I had a 
vague interest in boys, but at that stage they still weren&rsquo;t a big deal 
and I didn&rsquo;t even know how to flirt.&nbsp; &nbsp;I was in no way a threat 
to anyone and certainly not a person to be jealous of, but because I was 
relatively unaware, I became an easy target.</p> 
<p>As the year went by my bully became more confident and the comments became 
taunts.&nbsp;&nbsp; The taunts became harsher and more frequent until I was 
scared of walking through school halls for fear of being jeered at.&nbsp; I not 
only endured the taunts from the bully but her followers that also joined 
in.&nbsp; Each time I encountered them I suffered personal remarks about the 
way I looked, what I wore, how immature I was physically and how I spoke.&nbsp; 
I started to find notes in my desk that contained unpleasant comments and 
threats towards me and my family.&nbsp; Even though I told my closest friends 
how bad it was getting, none of us, including myself, would dare tell a teacher 
or my parents, it just wasn&rsquo;t done in those days.&nbsp; I kept my head 
down, endured the taunts and stopped going up to the common.&nbsp;&nbsp; I 
became moodier at home but my parents put that down to me being a teenager and 
never asked me why.&nbsp;</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>With some of my dog clients on Wimbledon Common.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>I remember how proud I was to get a new jacket one day and how good I felt 
wearing it.&nbsp; I remember cycling across the common towards home and having 
the bully and her friends shout at me and make fun of my jacket as I cycled 
home in tears.&nbsp; I never wore it again and my mother couldn&rsquo;t 
understand why I was being so ungrateful.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I began to retreat 
into myself, became quieter and more reserved.&nbsp; I dreaded going to school, 
cycling on my beloved common and walking the school halls.&nbsp; Finally even 
my best friends turned against me, because they were threatened that if they 
didn&rsquo;t they would be banished from the group, so I had no one.&nbsp; The 
bully had achieved what she set out to do.&nbsp; She had completely suppressed 
me until I submitted to her dominance.&nbsp; She had won.</p> 
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why it happened, but one day the tide turned and 
overnight the bullying stopped.&nbsp; I was walking in the village when some of 
my old friends came up to me, apologized for turning against me and walked me 
onto the common to face my bully.&nbsp; The most popular boy in the group told 
her to leave me alone and that there would be consequences if she 
didn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; I looked at her pinched, angry face and for the first time 
I met her eyes and held them there. &nbsp;&nbsp;I felt a power surge through me 
that made me dizzy and my vision went blurry.&nbsp;&nbsp; I felt like taking up 
my fist and plowing it through her to get rid of that awful face that had 
taunted me for two years.&nbsp; My body trembled and my mouth went dry, but I 
did nothing and not a word passed between us, because I know she saw the look 
on my face and for the first time I saw worry in hers.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Hate is a strong word, especially when it is directed towards a 
person.&nbsp;&nbsp; There are few people that I have known in my life, that I 
could use that word for, but she is one of them.&nbsp; I hated her then and I 
will hate her for the rest of my life.&nbsp; Maybe I am weak to do so and 
should learn to forgive what she did to me, but I&rsquo;m not that good a 
person.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Ahhh the fasion of the 1980's. Ripped jeans on the Common.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>From then on I learned to be direct, to tell the truth and to share my 
feelings with people I could trust.&nbsp; I learned to fight for the 
vulnerable, to stand up against cruelty and to champion causes I really 
believed in.&nbsp; I continue to do that to this day in my private and public 
life.&nbsp; &nbsp;I abhor people who hurt and bully others and will fight for 
justice.&nbsp; &nbsp;I despise those who still utilize dominance training 
methods when teaching dogs to behave.&nbsp; Jerking, restraining, poking, 
nudging, hitting, shouting or shocking dogs is just a form of bullying.&nbsp; 
It stems from ignorance and a fear of losing control or having an animal 
seemingly control them.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It makes me so sad to see trainers 
and dog owners use these methods on their dogs, thinking that what they are 
doing is right and good, when they are oblivious to the signals that their dogs 
are giving them, signals that the dogs are using to try and communicate to 
their bullies to stop.&nbsp;&nbsp; I see so many dogs that have given up like I 
did.&nbsp; They behave and follow their masters and do what they are told and 
their masters are happier that they have such &ldquo;obedient&rdquo; 
dogs.&nbsp; What the masters don&rsquo;t know is that their dogs are only 
following them because they have been suppressed and dominated, and they, like 
me, fear the consequences if they fight back.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p> 
<p>At university I learned to empower myself, became a guardian angel on the 
London Tube trains to help people in distress, worked in shelters to help 
scared and abandoned animals and became a personal security guard to defend 
others.&nbsp;&nbsp; Although I didn&rsquo;t make personal security my career, I 
learned so much about myself and what I was capable of.&nbsp; I learned to 
think with my head and not my fist, respect everyone and protect those that 
couldn&rsquo;t protect themselves.</p> 
<p>Even though I might come across as hard on my television show, every client 
knows that I am going to work for them and their dog 100%.&nbsp; &nbsp;I am a 
compassionate person and even though a client might not like to hear what I 
have to tell them, I communicate with sincerity and a desire to help improve 
lives that have gone awry.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am a strong woman now, but 
I never forget what I went through to get there and that makes me continue to 
fight against those that bully people or animals.&nbsp;&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t 
know where my bully is now, nor do I care because she is dead to me.&nbsp; But 
she did teach me an important lesson.&nbsp;&nbsp; She taught me to stand up for 
myself in a non-violent way and to fight for what I believe in.&nbsp; She made 
me see that a bully is not a powerful, confident person at all, but an insecure 
and weak person that manipulates and controls others to support their own 
insecurities.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Had I known this from the start, things would 
have been different, but I make very sure that my daughter, her friends and my 
nieces&nbsp; know, so that they will never have to go through an experience 
like mine.</p> <br>

<h3>A Chat With Dr. Marty Becker</h3> Posted by Victoria Stilwell - 06/09/11 
at 05:06:46 am -5 Comments<br>

<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Victoria with Dr. Marty Becker at the 2011 Global Pet Expo</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>As much as we love our dogs, there&rsquo;s no doubt we can always use more 
safe and effective tips to make caring for them easier and less expensive. 
There are hundreds of ideas that people can use to do this - everything from 
cutting shedding by 90% to keeping dogs calm during thunderstorms. These and 
other veterinary secrets are the heart and soul of a new book by my friend Dr. 
Marty Becker, &ldquo;America&rsquo;s Veterinarian&rdquo; and a regular on 
&ldquo;Good Morning America&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Dr. Oz Show.&rdquo;</p> 
<p><em>Your Dog: The Owner&rsquo;s Manual </em>is Dr. Becker&rsquo;s latest 
book, and he says it&rsquo;s his best yet, filled with all the &ldquo;Secrets, 
Surprises and Solutions&rdquo; you need to make living with your dog easier and 
better for you both.</p> 
<p>I sat down with Dr. Becker recently to ask him about his book, and why he 
thinks it&rsquo;s so important that people have access to information like this.
</p> 
<p><strong>Victoria:&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp; Welcome, Dr. Becker, and 
congratulations on your new book,<em>Your Dog: The Owner&rsquo;s Manual</em>
.&nbsp; Clever title.&nbsp; How&rsquo;d you come up with it?</p> 
<p><strong>Dr. Becker:&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp; Thanks, Victoria! As you know, Dr. 
Mehmet Oz is a friend of mine, and I&rsquo;m a member of &ldquo;Core Team 
Oz&rdquo; on &ldquo;The Dr. Oz Show.&rdquo; I love his book &ldquo;<em>You: The 
Owner&rsquo;s Manual</em>,&rdquo; and thought we really needed a book like that 
for dogs and for cats (&ldquo;Your Cat&rdquo; comes out next spring.) &nbsp;I 
talked to Dr. Oz about using the title, and he graciously gave me permission. 
His show was one of my first appearances after the book came out last month, 
and he gave copies to everyone in his studio audience. The title is all very 
tongue-in-cheek &ndash; dogs and cats are family members, of course, and these 
books reflect that.</p> 
<p><strong>VS:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Can you explain for our dog-loving audience 
what exactly makes this book different?</p> 
<p><strong>DMB:&nbsp;</strong> There are a lot of good dog books, and you and 
I have already written a few of them. But the reason I wrote<em>Your Dog: The 
Owner&rsquo;s Manual</em>is because of what I knew as a practicing veterinarian 
who has stayed on the cutting edge of veterinary care.&nbsp; I knew if I could 
get my &ldquo;Secrets, Surprises and Solutions&rdquo; I shared with people in a 
well-written book, I could make a difference in a lot of lives. I could help 
make people and the pets they love healthier and happier. &nbsp;You know me, 
Victoria, and you know that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m all about.&nbsp; So yes, 
there are hundreds of these tips, little-known inside information that even 
some veterinarians don&rsquo;t know about, and each tidbit will make life 
easier for a dog-lover.</p> 
<p><strong>VS:&nbsp;</strong> Can you give me an example or two?</p> 
<p><strong>DMB:&nbsp;</strong> Of course! The No. 1 thing people don&rsquo;t 
like about their dogs is shedding, and the No. 1 reason people take dogs to the 
veterinarian is for skin problems. Here&rsquo;s the secret: You can take a bite 
out of both of these problems by bathing your pet every week.&nbsp; I know 
that&rsquo;s going to shock a lot of people. It&rsquo;s true that for decades 
we veterinarians have learned &ndash; and shared the information with our 
clients &ndash; that frequent bathing dried out a dog&rsquo;s skin and coat and 
was not recommended.&nbsp; But new clinically proven studies prove the 
opposite: Frequently bathing is the BEST thing you can do to prevent and 
address allergies and other skin problems in your dog. And it also cuts down on 
shedding. That&rsquo;s a secret, a surprise and solution all in one, and you 
only find it in<em>Your Dog: The Owner&rsquo;s Manual</em>. And it&rsquo;s one 
of hundreds, I can tell you.</p> 
<p>Here&rsquo;s another: A common poisoning risk to your dog isn&rsquo;t 
something most people are terrified of their dog getting into, such as 
chocolate, which is actually relatively low-risk &ndash; especially milk or 
white chocolate. But it is something sweet that most people don&rsquo;t think 
to put out of a pet&rsquo;s reach: Gum or candy sweetened with Xylitol. A stick 
of gum can drop of 50-pound dog &ndash; it&rsquo;s THAT dangerous. Most people 
don&rsquo;t know, and that&rsquo;s a &ldquo;secret&rdquo; I want shared.&nbsp; 
There&rsquo;s of stuff like that in the book, and as a practicing veterinarian 
I can tell you that I see sick pets all the time who are at death&rsquo;s door 
because of things their owners didn&rsquo;t know. This book helps to get the 
information out there.</p> 
<p><strong>VS:&nbsp;</strong> Very interesting, Marty!&nbsp; What else are you 
sharing? Anything that can help people choose the right dog and get the 
relationship started on the right paw, as it were?</p> 
<p><strong>DMB:</strong>&nbsp; Victoria, as you know, my daughter, Mikkel 
Becker, is just starting her career as a dog trainer, and I&rsquo;m also 
honored to know some of the world&rsquo;s best trainers and veterinary 
behaviorists, such as you. You&rsquo;d better believe I put some of that great 
information from these experts in the book. This is, after all, an 
&ldquo;owner&rsquo;s manual,&rdquo; and I made it as comprehensive as anything 
else I&rsquo;ve ever published.&nbsp; So, yes, there&rsquo;s information on how 
to choose a puppy or dog, and how to make your new family member comfortable 
quickly. Basic training and problem-solving, but again, the emphasis is on 
those &ldquo;Secrets, Surprises and Solutions.&rdquo;</p> 
<p><strong>VS:</strong>&nbsp; I understand you&rsquo;ve been taking your 
message on the road? What&rsquo;s the story there?</p> 
<p><strong>DMB: </strong>Yes, and what a trip it is! We have a custom-wrapped 
45-foot &ldquo;rock star&rdquo; bus that has previously been used to transport 
&ldquo;Dog: The Bounty Hunter,&rdquo; David Copperfield, Lady Gaga and touring 
Broadway shows. It&rsquo;s quite the rig: Six TVs, two baths, a shower, a small 
kitchen and a full bedroom. We&rsquo;re almost finished with a 45-day tour for 
the book, and also to promote the idea that &ldquo;Healthy Pets Visit 
Vets.&rdquo; You see, we have this idea that pets should go to the veterinarian 
when they&rsquo;re sick only, but that&rsquo;s not the best way to handle 
things. When a pet-lover and a veterinarian work together on preventive care 
for a pet, the result is a longer, happier life &ndash; and a lower overall 
veterinary cost. That&rsquo;s a message that needs to get out.</p> 
<p><strong>VS:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Where can people find you on this tour?</p> 
<p><strong>DMB:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;The complete schedule is at 
www.drmartybecker.com,&nbsp;along with information on where to buy to the book. 
I&rsquo;m doing book-signings and meet-and-greets at PETCOs across the nation, 
and I encourage people to come by, and to bring their dogs. I love to meet 
people, and I&rsquo;m happy to help by answering questions.</p> 
<p>I&rsquo;d also like to add that along with the book-signings, I&rsquo;ve 
set up a contest to help people help their favorite shelters and rescue groups 
&ndash; and everyone can get involved in that. Our sponsors have chipped in 
more than $70,000 in products for these non-profits, with $20,000 going to the 
Grand Prize winner.&nbsp; Those details are also on DrMartyBecker.com.</p> 
<p><strong>VS:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you, Marty! Best of luck with 
the book, and I hope we can chat again soon.</p> 
<p><strong>DMB:&nbsp;</strong> It would be my pleasure!&nbsp; Thank you for 
helping me spread the word on<em>Your Dog: The Owner&rsquo;s Manual</em>. 
It&rsquo;s a very special book to me!</p> <br>

<h3>Commonly Found Dangers in Your Backyard</h3> Posted by Victoria Stilwell - 
06/07/11 at 09:06:54 pm -69 Comments<br>

<p></p> 
<p>Whew - that was close. After a fraught couple of days, it became clear just 
how close we came to losing our precious little newest addition &ndash; our 
rescued Chihuahua mix Jasmine. What happened to us could happen to anyone, so I 
wanted to be sure to pass along our experience in the hopes that it may spare 
you the worry and panic that we suffered through a few days ago.</p> 
<p>On Memorial Day we were preparing to head out of town to the beautiful 
north Georgia mountains for a short getaway. Before we left, we visited some 
friends with a beautiful back yard. Since we knew we&rsquo;d probably be gone 
for several hours, longer than Jasmine could hold herself (housetraining 
continues on, even for dog trainers!), we decided to take the dogs with us 
(after getting our friends&rsquo; blessing) for a little field trip. Sadie and 
Jasmine had a wonderful time exploring their home and backyard, though how 
Sadie puts up with Jasmine&rsquo;s incessant heel and elbow-nipping I&rsquo;ll 
never understand &ndash; that dog has more patience than Job!</p> 
<p>As we were packing up to leave our friends, we noticed something in 
Jasmine&rsquo;s mouth. No big deal. She&rsquo;s a 9 month old puppy, very 
inquisitive, so she&rsquo;s still in the process of discovering this strange 
world using her mouth as the primary tool. But when I got her to drop this 
little goodie, something didn&rsquo;t feel right. It was a tiny cylindrical 
black pellet, seemingly made out of tar or some very chewy substance. We all 
casually wondered aloud what it might have been until our host slowly and 
nervously joined in the conversation. Turns out he had put down some 
mole-killing poison in a section of his backyard where the moles had begun to 
wreak havoc, and our Jasmine had sniffed it out and had one of the pellets in 
her mouth.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Jasmine lying on her favorite bed.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Concerned, we went and looked at the poison container to investigate its 
ingredients and decided to call the poison control hotline just to be safe. We 
were sure that something you could buy at your local garden center 
wouldn&rsquo;t be a problem for domestic pets and that even if it weren&rsquo;t 
great for her, Jasmine couldn&rsquo;t have eaten enough of it to cause real 
trouble. But being a conscientious dog owner, I wanted to be sure. Of course 
the poison control hotline wasn&rsquo;t open on the holiday weekend, so I gave 
our lovely vet, Dr. Jones, a call to get his advice. When I told him that the 
primary active ingredient in the poison pellets was something called zinc 
phosphide, things got much more serious very quickly.</p> 
<p>Zinc phosphide is a highly toxic chemical that is used as a pesticide to 
kill mice, rats and other rodents. Once ingested, it is converted to phosphine 
gas by the moisture and acidity of the stomach. The gas builds up in the 
stomach and is a direct irritant to the lining of the stomach causing damage to 
the small blood vessels located there. The gas is then absorbed into the blood 
stream and is carried to the lungs, liver, and kidneys. It causes leaking of 
fluid into the lungs and into the chest cavity surrounding the lungs resulting 
in tremendous difficulty breathing. The animal can also asphyxiate on the gas 
that it burps up. The brain becomes deprived of oxygen, a situation which can 
lead to seizures and eventually death. The lethal dose for most animals is 20- 
50 mg/kg. Jasmine had an approximately one-ounce pellet based on the stuff in 
her mouth.</p> 
<p>Signs of zinc phosphide toxicity are vomiting, depression, tremors and 
weakness which usually occur within thirty minutes to four hours after 
ingestion. This may progress to an inability to get up, hypersensitivity to 
stimuli, seizures, respiratory distress, excess salivation, and death.</p> 
<p>Treatment involves removal of as much of the product from the stomach and 
intestinal tract as possible. This means inducing vomiting, and following up 
with activated charcoal. The charcoal will not absorb the gas but may prevent 
some of the gas from being released by absorbing the pellets. Gastric lavage 
with sodium bicarbonate to lower acidity and decrease release of phosphine gas 
is sometimes needed.</p> 
<p>Not knowing if she&rsquo;d actually swallowed any of the pellets, we 
immediately raced Jasmine to Dr. Jones&rsquo; office, where he met us from his 
Memorial Day celebrations, opened up the surgery and did the necessary 
procedures needed to give Jasmine the best chance of survival, including giving 
her charcoal to bind any pellets that had been ingested. Duffy is not the sort 
of veterinarian that over dramatizes a situation and is always positive and 
encouraging, but when I saw the worried look on his face, I knew that this was 
a very serious situation and if the treatment didn&rsquo;t work we might lose 
our precious girl. He wished us luck and told us if we made it through the next 
24 hours, Jasmine should be in the clear.</p> 
<p>We had all the windows in our car open as we drove her home, hoping beyond 
hope that it would be a pleasant, uneventful few days with no more trips to the 
vet. We left the windows open so that if Jasmine did happen to belch up any of 
the gas it wouldn&rsquo;t cause any further harm to her or us. Amazingly, 
people and other pets have been known to die because they breathed in the 
cyanide gas from an animal that had ingested zinc phosphide.</p> 
<p>Luckily, Jasmine is still with us, though we&rsquo;ll never know exactly 
how close we came to losing her since we&rsquo;re not sure whether or not she 
ingested any pellets that were counteracted by the charcoal. Frankly, I 
don&rsquo;t want to know. I just want to be sure that others learn from our 
ordeal and refrain from using products like these in places where their pets 
may be able to access them. This stuff was buried about 6 inches below the 
surface and covered with bark, leaves and rocks, and yet Jasmine with her super 
sense of smell was able to find and dig them out.</p> 
<p>Please be careful with the chemical products that you use in your home or 
your yard&ndash; there&rsquo;s no worse feeling than watching your beloved dog 
or cat closely for signs that they may be entering the struggle of their lives 
or worse, that they are about to lose their life altogether. Thanks to the 
quick action of Dr. Duffy Jones, we still have our beloved dog, and for that we

<p>Dear Victoria,</p> 
<p>I have a pit bull that&rsquo;s a year and 3 months. He&rsquo;s a good dog, 
but have only one problem. When he hears the door bell he gets very hyper, and 
when a guest comes over he jumps them at the door. He jumps on them and is all 
over them. How can I stop this behavior? I&rsquo;ve tried the wait command and 
it&rsquo;s not being affective. Please help.</p>

<h3>Hero Dog Tyson &ndash; Escanaba, MI</h3> Posted by Victoria Stilwell -

<p></p> 
<p>It does not get any more heroic than this -&nbsp;a dog that saved a life 
and a family that will always be forever grateful.&nbsp; Here's his amazing 
story as told by his grateful owner:</p> 
<p>&quot;Tyson is a two year old American Pitbull Terrier. He came into my 
family&rsquo;s life in December of 2009 when he was saved from breed specific 
legislation. I never knew what a blessing Tyson was going to be by bringing him 
into our family. We often fostered many dogs for our local animal shelter and 
Tyson was always by my side helping those dogs find their forever homes. He has 
become an amazing representation of his breed and is always looking for belly 
rubs when we go on our daily walks. In July of 2010 we were fostering a mother 
dog and her ten puppies. I had left the room to bottle feed the puppies when 
Tyson and my son, Joshua, were relaxing in the living room.</p> 
<p>&quot;Within a couple of minutes I heard Tyson hysterically barking. This 
is not typical for Tyson as he is generally quiet. I assumed someone was 
walking by or it was the mail man and I ignored his unusual barking. When I 
came back up the stairs I realized my home was completely smoke filled and 
black. I could hear some thumping and Tyson still barking. Tyson was dragging 
our one year old son from the living room into safety. After the fire 
department arrived and we were allowed into the home to see the damage done, I 
realized how lucky we were. The reclining chair Joshua was napping on with his 
crocheted baby blanket was filled with burn marks and ashes. This amazing dog 
was a blessing in disguise and he will remain a part of our family for the rest 
of his life. In my eyes he will always be our hero and our best friend.&quot;

<p></p> 
<p>Here is a dog that exhibits talent in a couple of areas, all of which show 
her love of humans and her passion for keeping us safe.&nbsp; Read why Emma's 
so special in the words of her grateful partner:</p> 
<p>&quot;My canine (K9) partner, Saint Joseph Township Fire Department (SJTFD) 
Base-70 K9 &quot;Emma&quot;, is a true American &lsquo;Hero Dog&rsquo;. 
Emma&rsquo;s a loyal public servant to surrounding tri-state communities by 
deploying as a Search and Rescue/Recovery (SAR) Dog through the SJTFD, IDHS 
District 3TF, Allen County Sheriff &amp; Fort Wayne, Indiana Police Department. 
Public service and training never end for certified SAR dogs such as Emma. For 
7 years this K9 good citizen has lent her extensive love for humans, 
intelligence, skills and strong work ethic not only to missing person 
operations &amp; public demonstrations but to enthusiastically teaching 
fire-prevention and home-safety practices.</p> 
<p>&quot;This public safety ambassador memorably demonstrates &ldquo;BE 
SAFE&rdquo; skills for children such as how to 'stop-drop-n-roll' when told, 
&quot;You're ON FIRE!&quot;; 'crawl out under the smoke' when told, 
&quot;There's smoke, how do you get out?!&quot;; 'plays dead' when asked, 
&quot;What happens if you breath smoke?&quot; and barks at me while knocking 
lighters/matches out of my hand when asked, &quot;Is this a toy? Can I play 
safe with this?&quot; Emma&rsquo;s endeared herself to her community to the 
point where children all over call her by name at public demonstrations, 
approaching her in the &lsquo;safe&rsquo; manner she taught them.</p> 
<p>&quot;Whether it&rsquo;s been supporting the DNR, FBI, IDHS, police or fire 
departments on a rescue/recovery or an ARC fundraiser, church circle, scouting 
group, school class or philanthropist society with public safety education, 
Emma&rsquo;s been a true &lsquo;hero&rsquo; - tirelessly, fearlessly &amp; 
memorably serving mankind with friendly licks, a wagging tail and her whole 
heart.&quot;</p>

05/26/11 at 03:05:08 pm -2 Comments<br>

<p></p> 
<p>A gorgeous dog carrying out a host of beautiful work! Hawk is a search and 
rescue dog who doubles as a therapy dog and is obviously making a HUGE 
difference in so many lives.</p> 
<p>Hawk began training for search and rescue when he was only 10 weeks old. As 
a member of Emergency K-9 Operations, Inc. Search and Rescue, he attained 
Operational Certification in Trailing, Area Search, Evidence Search, Building 
Search, Disaster First Response, and Human Remains Detection. Hawk was only the 
second K-9 to serve as a Clinton County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office Reserve K-9. He 
has worked with Master Trainers from NAPWDA, US Border Patrol, Royal Canadian 
Mounted Police and Miami-Dade Police Department. He assisted agencies in four 
states and Canada on searches involving disasters, drowning, suicide, murder, 
missing children and adults, wandering elderly, historical grave location, and 
evidence recovery. Hawk made his first find on his second deployment when he 
located two missing young people who had run away from their home. Soon after, 
he found a confused elderly woman who wandered from her residence. Working his 
first disaster, a fire that destroyed most of a city block, he located the sole 
victim of the fire under the rubble.</p> 
<p>The community knows Hawk because of his participation in hundreds of 
educational programs for schools and civic organizations on wilderness safety 
and abduction prevention at Safety Town, DARE, Scouts, National Night Out and 
Fire Department Safety Days. Nationally registered as a Therapy Dog, he visits 
at the Ronald McDonald House and the Sarah Harding Residence. He has worked 
with Alzheimer&rsquo;s sufferers to improve memory and reduce anxiety; with 
Physical, Occupational &amp; Recreational Therapists during rehabilitation of 
head trauma patients; and to comfort the terminally ill.</p>

<h3>Hero Dog Boo &ndash; Loveland, CO</h3> Posted by Victoria Stilwell -

<p></p> 
<p>Guide dogs are trained to do extraordinary things and in this story, Boo 
proves just how amazing they are!&nbsp; Check out this story from his lucky 
owner:</p> 
<p>&quot;Boo and I were a team for only two weeks when we had our first solo 
adventure together. It was a trip to Boston for a week of eye appointments. I 
was beyond exhausted when we made it to our tenth floor hotel room. Boo and I 
became familiar with the elevators and how to find the grass outside. At 10:00 
pm I collapsed into sleep with Boo curled up on the floor at my side. At 2:00 
am I am ripped from my deep slumber with Boo on top of me. My brain panicked 
thinking he had turned into Cujo and was going to mangle me. He remained on top 
of me until I became fully awake and fully understanding the fire alarms were 
blasting. I grabbed the phone, but nobody answered at the front desk. I grabbed 
Boo&rsquo;s leash and with shaking hands attached it to his collar. I grabbed 
his harness, but did not want to take the time to put it on. We stepped out 
into the hallway and the alarms were ear piercing.</p> 
<p>&quot;Boo remained calm as I panicked. I did not know where the stairs 
were. In Boo&rsquo;s ear I cried, &ldquo;Find the stairs&rdquo;. Boo took off 
down the hall, pass the elevators we knew, and stopped at the door to the 
stairs. We went down the flights of stairs until Boo stopped at another door. I 
opened it to fresh air. Boo guided me out and around the hotel to the front of 
the fire trucks. I wrapped my arms around Boo tight and cried with joy. I 
slipped his harness over his head and sat on the ground with him.&quot;</p>

<h3>Victoria Announces New Season of It&rsquo;s Me or the Dog!</h3> Posted by 
Victoria Stilwell - 05/17/11 at 10:05:00 am -8 Comments<br>

<p></p> 
<p>Victoria is excited to announce that she will be filming&nbsp;a&nbsp;new 
season of<em>It's Me or the Dog </em>later this summer in and around New York 
City.&nbsp; After shooting 4 UK seasons and with the 3rd US season currently 
airing on Animal Planet in the US, Victoria is thrilled to be returning to the 
New York metro area again to help dogs and owners achieve balance through her 
force-free, positive reinforcement dog training methods.</p> 
<p>&quot;I love New York City,&quot; says Stilwell.&nbsp; &quot;Having cut my 
teeth as a trainer in large part while living in Manhattan and Northern New 
Jersey, it was great to return to the area last season with<em>It's Me or the 
Dog</em>.&nbsp; I love&nbsp;New&nbsp;Yorkers.&nbsp; While they often have a 
reputation for being harsh and rude, I've&nbsp;found that&nbsp;they're among 
the most warm and welcoming people I've ever been around.&nbsp; I loved filming 
there last year&nbsp;and&nbsp;I'm really happy&nbsp;to&nbsp;be going&nbsp;back 
again later this year.&quot;</p> 
<p>&quot;We had some truly crazy situations in the last season we shot in New 
York, and I can't wait to see what's in store for me this summer,&quot; 
says&nbsp;Victoria.&nbsp; &quot;Hopefully I'll get to meet a few of my future 
clients this weekend at the NYC Pet show, too!&quot;</p> 
<p>Victoria&nbsp;was on hand to&nbsp;kick off the casting search for the 
upcoming season at theNYC Pet Show on Saturday, May 21st.&nbsp; After giving 
a&nbsp;presentation about her dog training experiences and answer fans' 
questions, Victoria&nbsp;stuck around&nbsp;to sign books and merchandise at the 
show.&nbsp; Joining Victoria at the show were the casting team from<em>It's Me 
or the Dog</em> as they began the search for the NY-area dogs and families most 
in need of Victoria's help, as well as three of Victoria's licensed dog 
trainers from the Victoria Stilwell Positively Dog Training (VSPDT) 
program.&nbsp; If you have an out-of-control dog, live in Tri-State area and 
would like to be on the show, come to the NYC Pet Show orone of the other New 
York-area casting events to audition to be on the show (it is not necessary to 
bring your dog, though they are welcome at the show provided they are on a 
leash).&nbsp;</p>

<p></p> 
<p>It is not just men and women serving this country and protecting the 
freedoms that we stand for. The military also includes heroic dogs that save 
the lives of our soldiers every day. Here is one handsome military dog with 
Presidential recognition for his service!</p> 
<p>MWD Ben C020 (retired) served his Country as a Patrol Narcotics dog in the 
United States Air Force. Ben was assigned to the Security Forces team. While 
his exact duties are mostly confidential, he was awarded a Medal of 
Commendation at his retirement ceremony at Bolling AFB. He also has a Letter of 
Appreciation signed by the President. His Commendation reflects a very large 
drug find and several &quot;live bites&quot; on &quot;bad guys&quot; who didn't 
want to behave. Ben represents the Military Working Dog in spirit, dedication 
and loyalty.</p>

<h3>It&rsquo;s OK for Big Guys to Have Small Dogs</h3> Posted by Victoria 
Stilwell - 05/16/11 at 05:05:36 am -6 Comments<br>

<p></p> 
<p>I love this.&nbsp; Check out manly man A.J. Hawk, fearsome linebacker for 
the Super Bowl Champion Green Bay Packers (sorry, honey) talking big about how 
big dudes shoudn't be ashamed of having little dogs.&nbsp; Appearing on ESPN's 
First Take, A.J. was interviewed with his Chihuahua Todd to discuss his pride 
in owning and loving small dogs, despite the fact that he's one of the most 
fierce football players in the game today (and part of the reason why my 
husband's Atlanta&nbsp;Falcons had an early playoff exit).</p> 
<p>This is more than just a cute story with a great image attached to it - I 
think this goes to the heart of the debate over BSL, 'dangerous dogs' and 
irreputable breeders.&nbsp; So many sections of our society feel compelled to 
bow to certain stereotypes and let those factors dictate the type of dog they 
choose to own.&nbsp;&nbsp; Whether it's supposed tough guys with bully breeds, 
soccer moms with designer cross-breeds or the rich and famous with 'handbag' 
dogs, I agree wholeheartedly with A.J. that we need to move into the 21st 
century and let those stereotypes die once and for all.</p>

<h3>The Safety Guide to Children and Dogs</h3> Posted by Victoria Stilwell - 
05/05/11 at 01:05:05 pm -8 Comments<br>

<p></p> 
<p>Dogs make wonderful companions and need to be treated with care and 
respect.&nbsp; Most dogs are very friendly and will not bite.&nbsp; However 
there are some dogs that will bite for reasons such as fear, anger, frustration 
or protection.&nbsp; It is vital that you recognize not just the signs that a 
dog is uncomfortable and maybe about to bite, but the situations that you could 
be in where the chance of a bite is more likely.&nbsp;&nbsp; Dogs never bite 
without giving a warning, but while some dogs might growl, tense up, or bark 
aggressively at you, others will give such subtle or quick warnings, they are 
easy to miss.&nbsp;&nbsp; Here are a few guidelines that you can follow when 
you are around dogs to keep yourself safe.</p> 
<ol> 
<li>Never touch a dog that&nbsp;is unknown to you.&nbsp;</li> 
<li>Even if you know the dog, always ask permission from an adult you know to 
see if it is ok to ask the handler if you can pet their dog.&nbsp;</li> 
<li>Even when you have permission, do not invade the dog&rsquo;s body 
space.&nbsp; Allow the dog to come up to you and sniff your closed fist (palm 
down, knuckles facing the dog).&nbsp; If the dog does not want to come and 
greet you, respect that decision and leave him alone.&nbsp; Do not approach a 
dog from behind or pet a dog directly on the top of his head.&nbsp; The back or 
side is the best place to pet.&nbsp; If the dog moves away while being pet he 
has probably decided that he has had enough so allow him to have space and do 
not follow.</li> 
<li>Never stare at a dog and never put your face close to a dog&rsquo;s 
face.&nbsp; Remember to look at the dog briefly and then look away, look and 
look away.&nbsp; These are calming signals which tell the dog that you are no 
threat.</li> 
<li>Do not tease a dog.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li> 
<li>Do not touch a dog that has been tied up or left at the end of a chain in 
a yard, outside a store or behind a fence</li> 
<li>Tell an adult immediately if you see a dog that is loose in your 
neighborhood.&nbsp; Do not touch it.</li> 
<li>Do not touch a dog while she is eating.&nbsp; What would you feel like if 
a dog came up to you while you were eating and tried to take your food 
away?&nbsp; I suspect that it might make you angry or you would want to prevent 
the dog getting your food.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is the same for a dog so respect that 
a dog&rsquo;s food is her food and you should not go near it.</li> 
<li>Do not touch a dog while he is sleeping.&nbsp; You might startle him and 
he could react without thinking and snap at you.</li> 
<li>Do not take a bone or toy away from a dog if she is playing with it.&nbsp;
</li> 
<li>Do not push a dog off the sofa or chair if you want to sit there.&nbsp; 
Always get an adult to remove the dog for you.</li> 
<li>Do not scream and run away from a dog.&nbsp; If a strange dog comes up to 
you and you are scared, put your hands together, stand still, look away and 
completely ignore him until he loses interest in you and goes away. &nbsp;Be a 
Tree! The more boring you are, the less the dog will want to interact with 
you.&nbsp; When the dog has finished sniffing and walks away from you, walk 
slowly away and tell an adult.&nbsp; You can also &lsquo;be a tree&rsquo; if 
you are at someone&rsquo;s house with a rambunctious dog.&nbsp; Do not feel 
embarrassed about asking an adult to put the dog away in a different room if he 
makes you feel uncomfortable</li> 
<li>If you are on the floor and a dog comes up to you that makes you feel 
uncomfortable,&nbsp;roll onto your knees and curl up into a ball with your head 
facing down and with&nbsp;your&nbsp;hands clasped behind your neck.&nbsp; Stay 
as still as a stone&nbsp;until the dog gets bored and walks away.</li> 
<li>In the unlikely event a dog bites and you are on the floor, be a stone 
again, tightly curled with your hands protecting&nbsp;the&nbsp;back of your 
neck&nbsp;and stay as still as you can until help arrives.</li> 
<li>Remember that a dog is an animal and not a cuddly toy.&nbsp; Most dogs do 
not like being hugged.&nbsp; Hugging in dog language can mean that a dog wants 
to fight and is not an expression of affection like it is in human 
language.&nbsp; Be gentle with any dog and do not engage in rough play.</li> 
</ol> 
<p>Now you have some good safety tips you can tell your friends, family and 
teachers.&nbsp; If you would like someone to visit your school to talk about 
dog safety, you can tell a teacher, parent or guardian to contact
www.doggonesafe.com to see if there is a &lsquo;Be A Tree&rsquo; presenter in 
your area.</p> <br>

<h3>Dog Bite Prevention &ndash; Part II</h3> Posted by Victoria Stilwell - 
05/04/11 at 08:05:00 am -6 Comments<br>

<p></p> 
<p>Parents and guardians need to be responsible for their dog at all times, 
without exception, and especially around children.&nbsp; A child should NEVER 
be left unsupervised with any dog at any time and dog and child should only be 
together when a responsible adult can actively supervise.&nbsp; This keeps both 
children and dogs safe.&nbsp; Education for parents and children is 
essential.&nbsp; It amazes me that adults seem to be more ignorant than 
children about how children should greet a dog.</p> 
<p>The following true story shows exactly what I mean:</p> 
<p>A handler was holding the leash of what seemed to be a very friendly rescue 
dog that had just come into the shelter.&nbsp; As I was standing in the room 
with the dog and the handler, a family came in with their six year old 
daughter.&nbsp; The girl approached the dog and, without asking the handler, 
took the dog&rsquo;s face in her hands and kissed it on the nose.&nbsp; The 
handler asked the girl&rsquo;s parents to take her away from the dog as its 
history was uncertain and the dog&rsquo;s reactions couldn&rsquo;t be 
predicted.&nbsp; The parents replied that the handler was not to worry because 
the child had a dog of her own and was therefore great with dogs.&nbsp; Now if 
the parents didn&rsquo;t realize that they had just put their child in 
harm&rsquo;s way by allowing her to greet a dog like that, there was no hope 
for the child.&nbsp; What they should have taught her was NEVER to approach a 
dog that she didn&rsquo;t know without asking her parents if she could ask the 
handler first and if consent was given, to pet the dog appropriately and never 
kiss a dog on the nose. If the child had been bitten the dog and the handler 
would have been blamed when the real blame should have been with the 
parents.&nbsp; Fortunately in this instance the dog was very friendly and no 
one got bitten, but you get my point.</p> 
<p>As a mother and a dog trainer I am dedicated to raising awareness and 
spreading the word about responsible pet ownership and dog bite prevention. 
&nbsp;I have set up a Dog Bite Prevention Task force, made up of professionals 
from all around the country, including veterinarians, lawyers, canine bite 
investigators and pediatric surgeons, each dedicated to educating the public 
and keeping people safe. &nbsp;I also utilize an excellent program called&nbsp;
Doggone Safe&nbsp;to help me spread the word.&nbsp; I am proud to be a 
&lsquo;Be a Tree&rsquo; presenter and spend much of my free time teaching bite 
prevention to kids in schools and other organizations.&nbsp; For bite 
prevention week, Doggone Safe has challenged its members and presenters to 
educate 50,000 kids during dog bite prevention week.Click here for more

Ashlynn was attacked and killed by a dog.&nbsp; Her grandfather Don Wing and 
father Ryan have set up an organization called DADD (Dads Against Dangerous Dogs
) in her memory, to raise awareness and educate children and adults so that 
this kind of tragedy does not happen again.&nbsp; I have had the honor of 
meeting and working with this brave family.&nbsp; Even though attacks of this 
nature are rare compared to the number of dogs in the United States, one 
fatality is too many.&nbsp;&nbsp; May Ashlynn live on in the hearts of those 
you love her and teach families and children all over the world to be safe 
around all animals.</p>

<h3>Dog Bite Prevention &ndash; Part I</h3> Posted by Victoria Stilwell - 
05/04/11 at 08:05:52 am -18 Comments<br>

<p></p> 
<p>From May 15th - 21st, I will be joining forces with the American Veterinary 
Medical Association, the US Postal Service&nbsp;and other organizations to 
promote&nbsp;National Dog Bite Prevention Week.&nbsp;&nbsp;Now more than ever, 
awareness needs to be raised about how to prevent dog bites from 
occurring.&nbsp; If you're like me and are concerned about this issue, then the 
latest statistics will alarm you, because dog bites in the United States and 
Great Britain are growing.&nbsp; Over a sixteen year period the number of 
hospital admissions caused by dog bites in the U.S. nearly doubled, increasing 
from 5,100 in 1993 to 9,500 in 2008, according to a report by the U.S. Agency 
for Healthcare Research and Quality.&nbsp; And as if these numbers 
weren&rsquo;t bad enough, according to 2010 statistics, there were 
approximately 4.5 million reported dog bites in the US, 800,000 of which were 
serious enough to require medical attention. &nbsp;Over the last ten years dog 
bites have increased 50% in England and 150% in Scotland. &nbsp;What is 
happening in these countries to cause such an increase?&nbsp; The more I 
investigate the dog bite problem, the more I am discovering the 
reasons&nbsp;why.&nbsp; You might be surprised at what I have found.</p> 
<p>In a veterinary study published in the Journal of Applied Animal 
Behavior&nbsp;(2009), lead author Meghan Herron, DVM says that confrontational 
training methods practiced by many trainers and handlers in the United States 
and Britain, are a contributing factor.&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr. Herron states that, 
&quot;Our study demonstrated that many<strong>confrontational training methods
</strong>, whether staring down dogs, striking them, or intimidating them with 
physical manipulation such as alpha rolls [holding dogs on their back],<strong>
do little to correct improper behavior and can elicit aggressive responses
</strong>.&quot;</p> 
<p>Dr. Jennie Jamtgaard, an applied animal behavior consultant and behavior 
instructor at Colorado State University College of Veterinary Medicine gives an 
example:</p> 
<p><em>&quot;I saw an Australian Cattledog mix with severe aggression 
(lunging, growling, barking) directed at other dogs whenever they came into 
view, even hundreds of feet away. The dog was fine with people and had never 
been aggressive to people before. The owners were mimicking what they had seen 
in popular media and dealt with the dog in a completely punishment-based way. 
They repeatedly tried to physically subdue the dog whenever it was aggressive. 
Finally, at a pet store the dog growled and lunged, and when the female owner 
tried to force the dog down, she was bitten on the arm. That was when they 
called me.&quot;</em></p> 
<p>Dr. John Ciribassi, past-president of the American Veterinary Society of 
Animal Behavior&nbsp;(AVSAB), explains why punishment can cause aggression:</p> 
<p><em>&quot;A typical scenario is a client with a 3 year old dog who has 
presented because of aggression directed at strangers that the dog meets either 
on walks or when guests come to the home. Initially the dog barks at people as 
they pass and backs away if approached, indicating that the aggression is due 
to fear. The owner is referred to a trainer or watches a show that demonstrates 
the use of choke chain or pinch collar and verbal or physical corrections. 
Because the dog now feels pain when it encounters the person it fears, the 
aggression escalates. As a result, now the dog lunges, snaps, and bites in 
situations where it used to bark and back away. In some cases the dog is so 
aroused it learns to redirect its aggression towards humans.&quot;</em></p> 
<p>Other contributing factors to dog bites include bad breeding practices 
utilized by the puppy mill industry and back yard breeders.&nbsp; These people 
only breed dogs for money, churning out puppies with no care or attention to 
correctly raising those puppies to be sociable and comfortable around humans 
and other animals.&nbsp; Lack of socialization causes fear and insecurity, 
which is at the very heart of aggressive response. Irresponsible dog ownership, 
particularly by those who own large breed dogs for intimidation or protection, 
is also a major factor.</p> 
<p>Jim Crosby, a leading investigator of dog bites and human fatalities from 
dog bites in the U. S.&nbsp; states:&nbsp;</p> 
<p><em>&quot;What I see these numbers indicating, based on my on-scene 
investigations, is that irresponsible owners tend not to spay and neuter, tend 
to chain their animals out for extended times with little or no socialization, 
and maintain their animals with less wisdom and care than most of us. Once 
again, it's the two-legged problem behind the four legger that precipitates the 
problems.&quot;</em></p> 
<p>The Humane Society of the United States reports that 50% of children will 
be bitten by a dog before their 12th birthday.&nbsp; Children under the age of 
five are most likely to be bitten and most of these bites come from a dog that 
the child knows; the family dog or that of a relative or friend.&nbsp; Children 
are most likely to be bitten in the face as they are closer to a dog&rsquo;s 
eye level making it easier for a dog to feel threatened by eye to eye 
contact.&nbsp; Children love to kiss and hug dogs, even though these 
expressions of affection do not translate well in the dog world. &nbsp;Fast 
movements can stimulate a dog&rsquo;s prey drive and/or chase instinct.&nbsp; 
Higher pitched voices can sometimes startle a dog and make it 
fearful.&nbsp;&nbsp; A dog can be frustrated through rough play or by teasing 
and a child can inadvertently inflict pain with the pull of a tail or a poke in 
the eye.&nbsp; It is also hard for a child to read and understand a dog&rsquo;s 
body language, therefore missing vital signals that can put them in 
harm&rsquo;s way.</p> 
<p><strong>So how should children protect themselves?&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p></p> 
<p>Here is the amazing story of a little dog that performed an enormous deed; 
he saved the life of his owner. Buster is an Emerging Hero with a large tale to 
tell - well, his owner tells it for him.</p> 
<p>Our Hero Buster came into our lives when my husband started a job that 
required him to travel. I looked for a puppy and found the best friend ever. 
Soon after Buster came into our lives my husband became very sick. After 
multiple hospital stays and surgeries, he came home from the hospital. Buster 
was 10 months old at the time. One night, my husband was sleeping downstairs in 
our living room; he was unable to use the stairs after his operation. Buster 
and I were sleeping upstairs and we were having a terrible ice storm that 
night. Buster woke me up barking. That wasn't like him. He's not a barker. I 
thought he may have heard a snow plow outside, but I realized he wasn't barking 
at the window, he was barking at the bedroom doorway. I decided since I was 
awake I would check on my husband. It was a good thing I did; when we got 
downstairs my husband was unconscious on the floor. He had gotten up and 
blacked out. He hit his face on a piece of furniture and cut his face. When I 
got him to the hospital his blood pressure was 55/30. The doctors said that if 
I hadn't found him when I did he very likely would have stroked out and 
possibly died. If it wasn't for Buster I never would have gone down to check on 
my husband, I didn't hear him fall but Buster did. My husband thanks Buster 
every day for saving his life. He's my husband&rsquo;s HERO!!</p>

<p>Even though I work with dogs every day and understand their contribution to 
both people and society, I am continually amazed at what they bring to those 
who need them most. This is the story of one such dog that brought comfort to 
many after a horrific event.</p> 
<p><strong>October 8, 2010</strong></p> 
<p>500 students and 30 staff members at the Kelly Elementary School in 
Carlsbad, CA were interrupted by gunfire on the playground. Two second grade 
girls were wounded. A team of district, community, and school personnel met to 
determine the best way to help the children reclaim their school and return to 
some sense of a safe and secure environment. Enter the HOPE Animal-Assisted 
Crisis Response teams to which Anise is a proud member. For two weeks directly 
following the incident, Anise and her caring teammates joined the campus during 
recess and lunch time. The HOPE AACR teams were sensitive and careful about how 
they interacted with the children, and they placed themselves strategically 
around areas of the playground to gently encourage children to venture back to 
the field. It was not long before the children&rsquo;s interest in Anise and 
her sweet teammates helped them overcome their concern about going back outside 
to play. Where there was fear and sadness, the teachers could once again hear 
laughter, children running with happy dogs, and Kelly Elementary school moving 
towards a new normal. There is no psychologist in the world like a dog kissing 
your face. As you can see, Anise did her magic with this child.</p>

<h3>Nevermind the Bollocks</h3> Posted by Victoria Stilwell - 04/21/11 at 
08:04:07 am -41 Comments<br>

<p></p> 
<p>Since&nbsp;last week's&nbsp;episode of <em>It&rsquo;s Me or the Dog</em> 
aired in the US featuring Eric and his Presa Canario Caspar, I have been 
inundated with people asking if Eric listened to my advice and finally had 
Caspar neutered.&nbsp;&nbsp; For those of you in other parts of the world who 
haven&rsquo;t seen the episode yet, here is a bit of background on the 
story.&nbsp;&nbsp; Caspar came from a breeder of Presa Canarios in California 
and was shipped to Eric in New York State when the pup was eight weeks 
old.&nbsp; Eric wanted to own a big powerful dog and was even more excited at 
the prospect of training that dog for protection, as encouraged by the 
breeder.&nbsp; He also wanted to use Caspar as a stud dog &ndash; a good way, 
he had been told, of bringing in some extra cash.&nbsp; Now I don&rsquo;t know 
about you, but I think it&rsquo;s highly irresponsible for a breeder to sell a 
jobless eighteen year old boy such a powerful dog for thousands of dollars and 
encourage him to train it for protection.&nbsp; But what do they care what I or 
anyone else thinks for that matter.&nbsp; Certain breeders are in the business 
of making money from their pups by selling them to boys like Eric, so that when 
the pups reach adulthood they can be used as powerful status symbols to 
compliment the macho image.&nbsp; Unfortunately for Eric, as Caspar grew, he 
began exhibiting behavior that was troublesome, including marking in the house, 
destructive chewing, lunging and barking at other dogs on walks and showing 
fear aggression to people when they came into his home.&nbsp; In order to 
control the behavior and on the advice of some &lsquo;people,&rsquo; Eric knew, 
he put a shock collar on Caspar in order to control his behavior.&nbsp; Trouble 
was the shock collar made Caspar even more reactive, especially towards 
strangers and Eric was worried that his dog was becoming dangerous.</p> 
<p>This was about the time I met and worked with Caspar on the 
show.&nbsp;&nbsp; I could see that he was on the edge of something very bad and 
I could also see that it was going to be very hard convincing Eric that using 
Caspar as a stud dog would just be contributing to the pet overpopulation 
problem.&nbsp; &nbsp;Neutering would solve that issue and it might help reduce 
Caspar&rsquo;s marking behavior as well. &nbsp;Eric worked hard on the 
training, but was worried that Caspar would lose his &lsquo;drive&rsquo; if he 
was castrated.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
<p>This blog isn&rsquo;t about how I helped Eric train Caspar, but is written 
to illustrate a real problem that people have (and I&rsquo;m sorry to be sexist 
here, but statistically the problem is mostly with men) about neutering their 
pets.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have a hard time respecting people&rsquo;s ignorance and 
denial when evidence is presented by so many studies on the medical and 
behavioral benefits of neutering.&nbsp; I am also well aware of the behavioral 
and medical complications that could arise from neutering too, but feel the 
pros far outweigh the cons.&nbsp; The bottom line is that some people are 
worried that neutering will somehow change their dogs and make them less 
&lsquo;manly.&rsquo;&nbsp; I seriously think that Eric and people like him 
don&rsquo;t want to neuter their dogs because not only are they worried how 
this will look to other people, they themselves will think differently about 
their dogs if they are castrated.&nbsp; In their eyes a dog without testicles 
is no longer the status symbol of macho power that they want.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
<p>And what about training a big powerful dog for protection work?&nbsp; What 
this breeder didn&rsquo;t seem to care about is that his line of pups happens 
to have some fear reactivity (and believe me it&rsquo;s not just how they were 
raised because genetics plays a part) and that teaching an unconfident dog bite 
work is like giving a toddler a loaded weapon and encouraging him to play with 
it with the safety off.&nbsp; It is only a matter of time before that weapon 
will go off and the consequences will be dire.&nbsp; People who get dogs for 
protection don&rsquo;t realize how much time and effort it takes to train a dog 
to do bite work and how much time you have to spend reinforcing the training as 
well as giving your &lsquo;time bomb&rsquo; large amounts of physical exercise 
and mental stimulation (which of course Caspar wasn&rsquo;t getting).&nbsp; It 
is a recipe for disaster because it&rsquo;s literally playing with fire and one 
day you or a member of the public will get burned.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
<p>So to all the macho men (and women too sometimes), I just want to say one 
thing.&nbsp; Your dog will still be driven, trainable, workable and lovable 
without his dangly bits.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s not you that is getting 
castrated.&nbsp; In fact a responsible person who recognizes the importance of 
neutering both for health, behavioral and over population problems, is a lot 
more powerful in my book than a boy or a man that needs a big powerful dog to 
compliment and extend that part of their anatomy that is so obviously 
lacking.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p> <br>

<h3>Why BSL Doesn&rsquo;t Work</h3> Posted by Victoria Stilwell - 04/06/11 at 
05:04:40 am -71 Comments<br>

<p></p> 
<p>I am a mother. I am also a dog owner and dog trainer who has committed my 
life to helping people find the most effective, humane and responsible way to 
live in harmony with their dogs while also affording them the respect they 
deserve. Over thousands of years, these beautiful creatures have gradually been 
domesticated by humans, so it is therefore incumbent upon us as the higher 
species to give them the tools they need to live successfully in our strange, 
human environment. Too often, however, we fall short and fail to understand the 
intricate yet ultimately simple dynamic that exists between man and dog, 
transposing our human insecurities and weaknesses onto dogs and assuming that 
they&rsquo;re capable of being treated like and judged as four-legged humans.
</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Lennox was confiscated by the Belfast authorities because of how he looked.
</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>This fundamental disconnect has recently been exposed publicly once again 
by the recent firestorm surroundingthe case of Lennox, a Bull Dog/Labrador 
cross owned by an extraordinarily responsible family in Belfast, Ireland. 10 
months ago, Lennox was confiscated by the authorities in Belfast simply because 
his bodily dimensions fall into a breed category the government calls a 
&lsquo;Pit Bull Type&rsquo;.&nbsp; Pit Bull Type dogs are one group among 
several breeds which have been banned in Northern Ireland by Breed Specific 
Legislation (BSL). The general concept underpinning BSL is that the most 
effective way to determine whether or not a certain dog could potentially pose 
a threat to humans is by classifying and generalizing entire breeds of dogs as 
&lsquo;dangerous&rsquo;, regardless of the individual dog&rsquo;s temperament, 
behavioral history or owner&rsquo;s actions.</p> 
<p>It continues to confound me that there are still proponents of BSL given 
both the behavioral science which is now available and the abysmal track record 
of municipalities that have attempted to curb dog attacks by instituting BSL. 
We know so much more than we did even 20 years ago about how dogs think, what 
they feel, how their brains are wired (very similarly to ours, as it turns 
out), and what could potentially cause them to aggress. Ironically, one of the 
most commonly found attributes among aggressive dogs is not their breed, but 
rather a lack of confidence and insecurity. Think of the typical schoolyard 
bully &ndash; is he generally a self-confident kid or one who actually suffers 
from significant insecurity issues? The same general concept can be applied to 
dogs.</p> 
<p>Regardless, counties, cities and entire countries around the world continue 
to turn to BSL policies in a desperate attempt to protect their public from the 
rising number of serious (and sometimes fatal) dog bites. I share this desire 
to reduce the number of dog attacks. As a doting mother of a beautiful 7 year 
old girl, my heart literally breaks every time I hear about another child who 
has been mauled by the family dog, which is why I have set up a Dog Bite 
Prevention Task Force to help educate the public about responsible dog handling 
and safety. The vast majority of fatal dog attacks share one glaring yet 
often-overlooked characteristic: usually at least one component of the scene is 
not in its usual environment. Either the dog is staying with the uncle, the 
grandparents are babysitting for the child, or someone outside their normal 
circumstance is placed as the primary guardian. The key to avoiding these 
tragedies is not to make owning certain breeds illegal, but rather to ensure 
that everyone in charge of dogs and/or children is educated about safe 
practices and never leaves any dog alone with any child.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Pit bulls can make great family pets in the hands of a responsible owner</p>
<p></p> 
<p>Simply put, any breed of dog can bite, and any breed of dog can make a 
perfect family pet. Yes, the bigger and stronger the dog, the more damage it is 
capable of inflicting, although I have seen horrific footage of bite wounds 
from small dogs such as Jack Russell Terriers and Chihuahuas as well. Which 
breed of dog was named &lsquo;most aggressive&rsquo; in recent scientific 
studies?&nbsp; The family Dachshund. Does that mean we should add Dachshunds to 
the list of &lsquo;Dangerous Dogs&rsquo; as defined by lawmakers in favor of 
BSL? Of course not. Years ago it was German Shepherds in the bullseye. Then 
Rottweilers. Now Pit Bulls. I&rsquo;ve trained countless Pit Bulls, and have 
found them to be among the most loyal, smart and trainable dogs I&rsquo;ve 
worked with. That said, it is indeed possible to turn them into deadly weapons 
if they&rsquo;re in the wrong hands, just as it is with any breed of dog. Every 
dog is different, and those differences are not due to the breed of the dog, 
but rather to the individual dog&rsquo;s breeding and the environment in which 
it was raised. Using aggression, intimidation and forced submission on a 
fearful, unconfident dog is like treating fire with fire, as the dog&rsquo;s 
issues are often merely suppressed rather than treated and resolved 
effectively. In the majority of cases, dogs like Lennox that are confiscated 
due to BSL are inhumanely warehoused and dealt with using this confrontational 
approach, which often creates the very problems the law was attempting to 
avoid.&nbsp; Having not had a chance to evaluate Lennox for myself since 
he&rsquo;s been incarcerated, I can only hope that his tortuous past few months 
have not made&nbsp;him another victim of this vicious cycle.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Victoria has worked with countless pit bulls and considers them fantastic 
pets in the right hands.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>So if we&rsquo;re not going to ban certain breeds, what&rsquo;s the 
solution? As a society we must focus on the other end of the leash. First, we 
must make a concerted effort to crack down on and eliminate 
&lsquo;backyard&rsquo; breeders and puppy farmers who churn out puppies with no 
regard for the well-being of the dogs and are only interested in making money. 
But the most effective way to reduce the number of dangerous dogs is to stop 
irresponsible owners from raising their dogs to be aggressive, intimidating 
potential weapons.</p> 
<p>It infuriates me to see the number of &lsquo;macho&rsquo; men who want to 
get a big, strong, intimidating-looking dog in order to stroke their own egos 
and replace whatever &lsquo;manliness&rsquo; may be missing from their own 
anatomy. Bully breeds in particular have borne the brunt of this phenomenon 
lately, where just because of the way the dog looks, he&rsquo;s classed as a 
dog not to be messed with around the neighborhood. The same concept is at play 
(though usually with less ominous results) when a trendy soccer mom wants to 
get the latest designer crossbreed because it is the &lsquo;in&rsquo; thing to 
do. I&rsquo;m always frustrated when I hear people say they want to get a 
certain type of dog &lsquo;for protection&rsquo;, not realizing that actual 
protection dogs are incredibly rare, while their family pet-turned-guardian is 
actually nothing more than a ticking timebomb waiting to go off once their 
child brings a friend over for a playdate. If you feel like you need 
protection, invest in an alarm system instead of a dog.</p> 
<p>If we could somehow prosecute those who willingly encourage their dogs to 
be aggressive, I firmly believe the number of tragic accidents would decrease 
significantly. But even if that&rsquo;s not possible in the short term, or even 
if one chooses to ignore the facts that science has presented to us about 
animal breeds and behavior, there&rsquo;s one more simple but powerful argument 
against BSL: it doesn&rsquo;t work.</p> 
<p>Statistics have shown that throughout the world, wherever BSL has been 
initiated, the number of dog bites has actually increased since the legislation 
has passed. This is the case in Scotland, England, parts of Canada, certain 
cities in the US, the Netherlands and beyond. In every single case, dog bites 
have become more of a problem since governments began banning breeds. What more 
evidence do we need as a society to realize that BSL is ultimately ineffective, 
if not also unfair?</p> 
<p>So as Lennox passes his seventh birthday in isolation in his Belfast jail 
cell, I urge you to contact your local government and speak out against BSL 
while calling instead for greater responsibility by owners. Let&rsquo;s give 
the animals we&rsquo;ve domesticated the best possible chance to succeed in our 
world &ndash; it&rsquo;s the right thing to do not just for the dogs, but for 
our safety as well.</p>

<h3>Save Lennox</h3> Posted by Victoria Stilwell - 03/31/11 at 09:03:42 am -

<p></p> 
<p>On the 19th May 2010, Lennox, a five year old American Bull dog Labrador 
cross was wrongfully seized by Belfast City Council Dog Wardens from his loving 
family home where he lives with his owners and his kennel mates. Lennox 
committed no crime nor did any member of the public complain about him.</p> 
<p>Lennox&rsquo;s family have done more than required by the law as 
responsible dog owners who also foster dogs for various Northern Ireland dog 
shelters. When Lennox was a puppy his owners had him neutered, licensed, 
insured, DNA registered, Pet Safe registered and micro chipped and although the 
Belfast City Council have issued a dog licence for Lennox for the last five 
years and continue to do so today, the Council now find the need to class him 
as a Pit Bull type dog and euthanize him.</p> 
<p>I have personally joined the fight to bring Lennox back to his loving home, 
having spoken at length by phone with his owner.&nbsp; After discussing the 
situation, I came away thoroughly impressed with what responsible dog owners 
Lennox's family are.&nbsp; I also developed an appreciation for his place in 
their family unit, as he serves as a therapy dog for the family's 12 year old 
daughter.</p> 
<p>Please help spread awareness of this horrific situation by signing the 
petition to have him released via the link below, distribute this information 
as widely as possible and using social media to help bring this beautiful, 
innocent dog home.&nbsp; Although this fight is for Lennox's life, there are 
countless other dogs in similar situations thanks to ignorance, 
misunderstanding, and ineffectual, faulty lawmaking.&nbsp; Whether you think 
it's morally correct or not (and in my opinion&nbsp;it's completely bogus - 
targeting the wrong end of the leash), the simple fact is that regardless of 
how you feel about certain types of dogs, Breed Specific Legislation (BSL) DOES 
NOT WORK.&nbsp; Dog bites in municipalities whose government have instituted 
BSL legislation have gone up across the board.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The Genesis Awards</h3> Posted by Victoria Stilwell - 03/28/11 at 01:03:54

<p></p> 
<p>On March 19th I attended the 25th Genesis Awards.&nbsp; The Awards are 
hosted by the Humane Society of the United States and honors &lsquo;outstanding 
individuals in the major media whose artistry and journalistic integrity have 
increased public awareness of animal issues.&rsquo;&nbsp; This was the second 
time I had attended and this year<em>It&rsquo;s Me or the Dog </em>was 
nominated for Best Reality Series.&nbsp; The show has been nominated for many 
different awards but this was a special one because it recognized the 
contribution that<em>It&rsquo;s Me or the Dog </em>is making in helping people 
build more positive relationships with their pets as well as addressing issues 
such as pet overpopulation and the importance of spay and neuter.</p> 
<p>I have spent a lot of time living and working in Los Angeles and even 
though I am grateful for the experience, the LA lifestyle is not what I 
ultimately strive for.&nbsp; To me the issues of helping animals is much more 
important than any fame that comes with my show, but now and again it is nice 
to visit and realize that I have come a long way from my dog walking days in 
Wimbledon.&nbsp; I am achieving what I always wanted and my heightened exposure 
allows me to fight for animal causes that I am passionate about.</p> 
<p>Walking the red carpet is always a unique experience.&nbsp; After stopping 
every couple of steps for the mountain of photographers to take your picture, 
it is time for print, TV, radio and on-line interviews.&nbsp; You can spend up 
to half an hour on a red carpet if there are enough people who want to talk to 
you. &nbsp;By the end of it my voice was hoarse and my face hurt from smiling 
so much, but it was great to meet so many people and talk about why events like 
the Genesis Awards are so important.</p> 
<p>The Awards themselves (slightly shorter than the Oscars) are a celebration 
of how the media has helped to report, expose and support animal issues that 
affect us all.&nbsp; The evening opened my eyes even more to the incredible 
cruelty that animals face.&nbsp; Some of the footage shown of the horror that 
many animals suffer at the hands of man was shocking and hard to watch, but I 
believe animal cruelty, which is still prevalent in so many industries 
including factory farming and puppy mills, needs to be highlighted in this 
way.&nbsp; The sheer scale of suffering is hard to stomach but media is the 
best way to expose these issues that would otherwise go unchecked.</p> 
<p>There is a section of society that mocks those of us who fight for the 
rights of animals, labeling us vegetarian freaks that go around throwing paint 
on people who wear fur, but the truth is that most of us are very normal. 
&nbsp;I am just one of millions of people battling to protect those that are 
vulnerable because we have a respect for nature and the animals that we share 
this planet with. &nbsp;It is hard to watch such brutality for human gain and I 
for one will not stand idly by and allow it to happen. &nbsp;Events like the 
Genesis Awards focus on change and it is that change that must be celebrated 
and encouraged.</p> 
<p><em>It&rsquo;s Me or the Dog</em> did not win the award, but that did not 
not matter to me because every nominee and winner are fighting for the same end 
and as the evening drew to a close I was just thankful for being part of a 
group of like-minded, strong individuals that are working hard to put an end to 
animal cruelty.</p> <br>

<h3>A Kid in a Candy Store</h3> Posted by Victoria Stilwell - 03/23/11 at

<p></p> 
<p>Victoria with Dr. Marty Becker at the 2011 Global Pet Expo</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>&#65279;I felt like a kid in a candy store last week surrounded by every 
kind of product a pet and their person could need. The Global Pet Expo takes 
place in March every year in Orlando and is so large that by the time you have 
walked the entire floor your feet are aching. The Expo is only open to those 
involved in the pet product industry and is the place where traders go to do 
business, make deals and launch new brands. There is a lot of money to be made 
in the pet industry and everyone is competing to get their product into the 
mainstream market. Businesses from all over the world come to the Expo, some 
demonstrating innovative new products that are clever in their originality and 
others that have me scratching my head in bewilderment trying to understand how 
they could possibly be serious. I won&rsquo;t mention any names but there are 
some people out there with some pretty wacky ideas. Then there are the food 
producers and manufacturers from the big name brands to the small organic 
businesses that have every kind of food or treat a pet could want. It&rsquo;s 
encouraging to see how natural and organic foods, once thought of as hokey and 
over-priced, are becoming more popular as consumers get smart about the 
importance of feeding their dogs a healthy diet.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Victoria was the recipient of the 2011 Excellence in Journalism Award.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>I was attending the Expo to receive the &lsquo;Excellence in Journalism and 
Outstanding Contribution to the Pet Industry&rsquo; Award. Past recipients of 
this award have included the wonderfulDr. Marty Becker, Rachel Ray and Ellen 
DeGeneres, so I was really honored to attend the ceremony and receive the 
award. You can watch video from the eventhere.</p> 
<p>I came home from the Expo laden with toys for the girls. Sadie and Jasmine 
are the best critics when it comes to dog toys and I rely on their expert 
feedback. While some of them were destroyed within a matter of minutes, others 
required a lot of mental energy, especially when there was food involved that 
needed to be extracted. I delighted in seeing their excitement as I produced 
yet another amazing creation for them to play with and after an evening of this 
the girls were exhausted. It reminded me how important it is to give dogs a 
chance to play while expending mental energy and there are so many wonderful 
toys out on the market that can give your dog hours of fun while tiring them 
out at the same time. It will be interesting to see if some of the new products 
I saw being launched at the Expo will make it into stores, because if they do, 
my girls will be very happy. &#65279;</p>

<h3>Our Newest (little) Addition</h3> Posted by Victoria Stilwell - 03/02/11 
at 12:03:53 pm -55 Comments<br>

<p></p> 
<p>I love Spring.&nbsp; It begins for me as soon as the dreary winter months 
of January and February are over.&nbsp; March is my favorite month not just 
because things feel new and fresh but because it was the month when my daughter 
was born.&nbsp;&nbsp; March was also the time when Sadie came into our lives 
and now three years later it is again the month that marks yet another big 
change in our household: Jasmine.</p> 
<p>During the years that my husband and I lived in New York City we were 
foster parents to over forty dogs and cats that came to stay with us while they 
were waiting to find their forever homes.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;We had countless 
dogs &ndash; from pitbulls to beagles &ndash; and numerous cats from kittens to 
adults, and each time we had to say goodbye to them it was a bittersweet 
moment. &nbsp;Their new families would be brimming with excitement as we handed 
our beloved fosters to them and we would be heartbroken at our loss, but happy 
that we had successfully pulled these animals out of the municipal shelters and 
placed them into loving homes.&nbsp;&nbsp; We took video footage of every 
foster and now and again watch the videos we made of the funny characters that 
stayed in our tiny Manhattan apartment.&nbsp; Shortly after 9/11 we pulled a 
very sick Maine Coon cat from Animal Control with the intention of nursing her 
back to health and then putting her up for adoption.&nbsp; The first day she 
came to us, she jumped onto our bed, rolled on her back, stuck her paws up in 
the air and went to sleep.&nbsp; She never left.&nbsp; Angelica was with us for 
eight years.&nbsp; She came with us everywhere we went and was the first to 
welcome our baby daughter home.&nbsp; She gave us such love that when she died 
we felt that our hearts would break.&nbsp; My daughter sleeps with a picture of 
Angelica next to her bed so that she can still see her beloved kitty every day 
and occasionally lights a memorial candle in her honor.</p> 
<p>Sadie (our Chocolate Lab) and Angelica had tolerated each other&rsquo;s 
company, but Sadie kept her distance as she had been on the receiving end of 
many a well-timed and grumpy swipe from Angelica.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Queen kitty 
ruled the roost and everyone knew it, so when she died Sadie went about life as 
if nothing had happened and all was perfectly normal.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For a 
year she was an only dog until last month when we decided to foster again and 
on a visit to the local shelter spied a small black and brown Chihuahua mix 
curled up asleep wearing a pink sweater with the words, &lsquo;Miss 
January&rsquo; on it. &lsquo;Sasha&rsquo; was a cautious but friendly little 
girl who had been dumped at the shelter in a cardboard box.&nbsp; It was 
obvious that she was uncomfortable in the shelter environment so after much 
conversation we decided to foster her and bring her home.&nbsp; For weeks we 
would talk about what kind of home Jasmine would do well in and even though we 
tried to keep ourselves from getting too attached, we were failing.&nbsp; We 
decided to give our foster a new name, Jasmine, and it seemed to fit.&nbsp; 
Named after Aladdin&rsquo;s brave princess, Jasmine strutted around our home 
like she had lived there all her life.&nbsp; She was playful and funny while 
also being serious and thoughtful and had us wrapped around her tiny paw within 
days.&nbsp;&nbsp; Even though my husband took a little longer to bond (seemy 
last blog post) he, too, started to melt and succumb to Jasmine&rsquo;s 
charms.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>So I am pleased to finally announce that my family and I are once again 
&lsquo;foster failures.&rsquo;&nbsp; Jasmine is now a permanent member of our 
family and we are the luckiest people in the world.&nbsp; Jasmine loves my 
daughter and likes nothing better than to wake her up in the morning, run 
around with her during the day and fall asleep in her arms at 
night.&nbsp;&nbsp; She steals anything she can find, which has made all of us 
really good at picking up after ourselves, barks at people coming through the 
door like a Rottweiler, (we&rsquo;re working on that one) and zooms around the 
house as if she were a Greyhound.&nbsp; &nbsp;She retrieves toys like a 
Retriever, scents like a Bloodhound, poops more than I&rsquo;ve ever seen a dog 
poop in my life, eats it occasionally &ndash; (we&rsquo;re working on that one 
too) and likes to lick Sadie&rsquo;s bottom (Sadie doesn&rsquo;t seem to 
mind.)&nbsp; At the end of the day, Jasmine likes to either snuggle up with us 
or sleep next to her new best furry friend, cuddled close into her for comfort 
and protection.&nbsp; Sadie enjoys the attention and licks her as she goes to 
sleep.</p> 
<p>We&rsquo;ve all fallen in love with little Jasmine and the best thing of 
all is that finally, instead of parting with a foster again, we are the ones 
that are lucky enough to give this beautiful dog her forever home.</p> <br>

<h3>Love Takes Time&hellip;.</h3> Posted by Victoria Stilwell - 02/11/11 at

<p></p> 
<p>We have a new foster pup staying with us at the moment &ndash; a six month 
old Chihuahua/min pin mix named Jasmine.&nbsp; She is a joyful soul who loves 
to play fetch, wrestle with toys and snuggle up when it is time for a 
nap.&nbsp; She loves her big foster sister Sadie and likes nothing better than 
to climb on top of her back to sleep or nestle by her side.&nbsp; Sadie has 
accepted Jasmine into the household and I have noticed that there is a 
&lsquo;pep&rsquo; in Sadie&rsquo;s step as if some of the younger dog&rsquo;s 
energy is flowing into her.&nbsp; My daughter loves Jasmine and already the two 
enjoy a relationship that is lovely for a parent to see.&nbsp; Sadie in turn 
has been enjoying more attention from all of us so that she doesn&rsquo;t 
resent the new addition.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>My husband, on the other hand, is having a harder time connecting with 
Jasmine.&nbsp;&nbsp; Wherever she lived previously (she was delivered to the 
local shelter in a box by two men who said they didn&rsquo;t want her) she was 
not housetrained, which means she is now on a toileting schedule.&nbsp; For 
anyone who has experienced toilet training a puppy, it is a time consuming 
process, but we have been pretty successful so far.&nbsp; That is until my 
husband takes over.&nbsp; Though he would argue that he's just unluckier than I 
am, I have a suspicion that he is not quite as diligent with the process as I 
am.&nbsp; Regardless of the reason why,&nbsp;there have been more accidents on 
his watch than on mine.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also pretty fair to say that he is not 
as&nbsp;consistent as I am when it comes to&nbsp;walking the dogs (sorry, 
honey).&nbsp; The last walk he took them on was an abject failure, as&nbsp;it 
was freezing cold and no one wanted to be outside anyway (including the 
dogs).&nbsp; Add to this the fact that although he is a very confident, 
enlightened man with modern sensibilities, he was not particularly overjoyed at 
having to use a fuscia leash to walk a tiny dog that was wearing a pink striped 
sweater to keep warm.&nbsp; Despite all this, where do I find him at the end of 
the day?&nbsp;&nbsp;On the sofa with the little dog asleep on his chest and a 
big brown one at his side, so however much he grizzles about her, I&rsquo;ve 
noticed a nice bond developing.</p> 
<p>Until yesterday.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>My husband was on dog watch for the day as I was out rescuing a chained 
pitbull, and he went to take a shower.&nbsp; He put Jasmine in her crate for 
safety as he didn&rsquo;t want her to walk around the house unsupervised.&nbsp; 
On coming out of the shower he noticed a rather pungent smell and his worst 
fears were realized.&nbsp; Jasmine had pooped in the crate.&nbsp; Keeping his 
calm he cleaned the crate up and went to work in his office.&nbsp; Jasmine 
snuggled up on the chair next to him and all was quiet.&nbsp; Then the heaving 
started. &nbsp;Jasmine began to make loud retching noises and as my husband 
desperately looked around for something to catch what he knew was coming out of 
her mouth, she vomited.&nbsp; Fortunately he had cupped his hand under her 
mouth and caught most of it in his palm.&nbsp; Cursing quietly he looked down 
at the mess to see what had made her sick.&nbsp; In the palm of his hand lay a 
nicely rounded ball of poop, her own poop that she had obviously eaten while 
she was in the crate waiting for him to return from the shower.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The best relationships are born out of travesty, enduring hard times 
together and battling through.&nbsp; My husband is a very kind man and loves 
dogs, working tirelessly with me to help dogs around the world, but sometimes, 
like many people do when raising a pup, he loses it.&nbsp; He likes Jasmine, 
but there is still room for growth and it is a lot for him to transfer a little 
of the profound love he has for our lab Sadie onto a peeing, poop eating, 
vomiting Chihuahua.</p> <br>

<h3>A Heartwarming Tale in the Winter Cold</h3> Posted by Victoria Stilwell - 
02/01/11 at 02:02:19 am -49 Comments<br>

<p></p> 
<p>During a cold spell in Atlanta, Georgia, when the whole city shut down and 
no one could go out for a week, we rescued a dog.&nbsp; For those of you who do 
not live in Atlanta &ndash; this was how crazy it got.&nbsp; We only had about 
five inches of snow, but what made the roads so dangerous was the sheet of ice 
that developed on top of the snow from the freezing rain that fell 
afterwards.&nbsp; With temperatures plummeting to below zero, the roads were 
like ice rinks and people that ventured out in their cars were risking their 
lives to do so.&nbsp; With only eight snow plows for a city of five million 
people, the city shut down. &nbsp;Conditions were so bad that every school 
closed for a week, which made for many happy children.&nbsp; In a way the snow 
was a blessing because there was nothing to do except stay inside with family 
and enjoy the time together.&nbsp; My daughter was overjoyed to be off school 
and we made the most of it, sledding, building snow men, and watching 
movies.&nbsp; It was also a special time because a few days into the big 
freeze, Ben came into our lives.</p> 
<p>I had heard through a friend of mine that a large, male, brindle-colored 
pit/mastiff mix was wandering around their neighborhood in the freezing 
cold.&nbsp; He was thin and nervous and even though neighbors had been trying 
for a week to catch him, he would skulk away when approached and not let anyone 
get close to him.&nbsp; Thankfully one of the neighbors had provided a bed for 
him on their back porch and was feeding him two large meals a day, but even 
with all this kindness, he resisted all attempts to be captured.&nbsp; When the 
snow and ice fell and the temperatures plummeted to dangerous levels, the dog 
would stand shivering in the cold, too scared to go in a house or let anyone 
approach him.&nbsp; The neighbors were worried that the cold would kill 
him.&nbsp; He was still eating but did not look well and was limping from a 
foot injury. The snow and ice had closed down animal control so there was no 
one to help rescue him. Things were beginning to look very bleak.</p> 
<p>Thankfully the area where the dog was located was not too far away, so I 
got in my car and drove carefully to the road where the dog had last been 
seen.&nbsp; As I arrived I caught sight of him limping into the undergrowth, 
but as soon as I switched off my engine he was gone.&nbsp; As I slid over to 
where he had been, trying desperately to keep myself upright on the ice, I saw 
a trail of blood going off into the trees.&nbsp; His paw had obviously been 
damaged in some way, probably cut on the ice, which was so sharp and thick it 
was like walking on glass.</p> 
<p>The homeowner who had been feeding the dog welcomed me into her house and 
showed me where he had been sleeping and eating.&nbsp; He came every night and 
several times during the day to eat warm food and sleep on the comfortable, yet 
cold bed that the neighbor had put out on the floor of their outdoor 
porch.&nbsp; As we were talking, I saw out of the corner of my eye a tall, 
gangly dog emerge from the woods and walk to the porch.&nbsp; He was skin and 
bones and was obviously hungry.&nbsp; He spied us looking at him through the 
window and barked at us as he backed away.&nbsp; Armed with a bowl of warmed up 
cat food (I do not recommend feeding cat food to a dog, but it is one of the 
smells and tastes that dogs cannot resist and is therefore the best kind of 
food to use if you want to catch a stray), I went out onto the porch and 
waited. &nbsp;I could see his nose twitch as he caught the smell of the food 
and slowly he edged towards me, never taking his eyes off me as he 
approached.&nbsp; I stayed still and reached out my arm with the bowl extended 
towards him.&nbsp; He came right up to the bowl and started eating suspiciously 
but as soon as I made even the slightest move, he darted away again.&nbsp; This 
was going to take longer than I had first anticipated.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>My friend Laura Janssen, Director of Animal Cruelty Investigations and 
Cruelty Prevention came to help me catch the dog armed with a humane trap that 
we set that up for the night.&nbsp; Surely this would be the answer and we 
could put an end to his misery.. &nbsp;&nbsp;That night the temperature fell 
rapidly and none of us slept as we thought of the poor dog out in the cold, 
desperately trying to survive.&nbsp; I did not relish the thought of turning up 
in the morning to find that he had frozen to death, but I did not know how he 
could possibly make it through another night of below freezing temperatures.</p>
<p>To our astonishment he was still there the next morning.&nbsp; He had been 
much too smart to go into the trap, preferring to sleep on the outdoor chairs 
instead.&nbsp; His breathing was labored and he had hardly eaten any of the 
food that had been left out for him that morning, but he was alive.&nbsp; The 
neighbors had been keeping a constant vigil all night but we all knew that 
surviving another night was near impossible.&nbsp; We had to catch him and do 
it fast because time was running out.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>It was at this point that the vets stepped in.&nbsp; Because he was proving 
so difficult to catch even in his condition, our vet (the wonderful Dr. Duffy 
Jones from Peachtree Hills Animal Hospital) recommended putting a sedative in 
his food to slow him down.&nbsp; There was a chance that his adrenaline might 
counteract the medication, but at this point it was worth a try.&nbsp; After he 
ate the food, we watched and waited.&nbsp; Now this was definitely going to 
work.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Two hours later he was as wide awake as he had been before the 
sedative.&nbsp; Arrgh!&nbsp; The night was drawing in fast and we were running 
out of options.&nbsp; Finally Dr. Jones suggested that he use a tranquilizer 
gun.&nbsp; He warned me that because the dog was in such poor condition darting 
might seriously harm him, but what choice did we have?&nbsp; The situation 
looked hopeless; we had run out of options.</p> 
<p>Sometimes the most obvious answer that has been staring you in the face all 
day takes along time to make itself known!&nbsp; The neighbors had told me that 
even though the stray wouldn&rsquo;t come up to people, he would come up to 
their dogs, even when their dogs were being walked in the neighborhood.&nbsp; 
He was obviously dog-friendly and trusted them much more than humans.&nbsp; 
That was the answer.&nbsp; Go out into the back yard with Laura&rsquo;s female 
dog Georgie and play &ndash; surely this is what was missing. &nbsp;&nbsp;At 
first the stray wanted nothing to do with the friendly black Lab that came 
bounding over to him, but then the most beautiful thing happened.&nbsp; The dog 
started to relax.&nbsp; As the veterinarians and I stood watching ready with 
the tranquilizer darts, the dog came up to Laura&nbsp; and Georgie and started 
to interact with them. Slowly but surely Laura put her hand up to him and 
stroked his head. As he came closer he nuzzled his head into her hand and then 
leaned his body into hers.&nbsp; With catchpole in hand she gently slipped the 
loop over his head.&nbsp; He made no move to get away but looked at her instead 
as if to say, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m done &ndash; take me home.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>My daughter named the dog Ben and as we sat with him at the veterinarian he 
put his head into my lap and went to sleep.&nbsp; Utterly exhausted from his 
adventure, Ben had finally come into the warmth for the first time in at least 
a week.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Ben now resides at a boarding facility where he has made many human and 
doggy friends.&nbsp; The other day Laura and I took him onto a local morning TV 
show to do theadopt-a- pet segment, and Ben took to the cameras like the true 
star that he is.&nbsp; Now we just have to find the right family for him and we 
know that they are out there.&nbsp; I have no doubt that soon our gentle Ben, 
who survived against all the odds, will find his forever home.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Watch video of Ben here. </p> <br>

<h3>Happy New Year!</h3> Posted by Victoria Stilwell - 12/31/10 at 04:12:23 am 
-54 Comments<br>

<p></p> 
<p>Is it just me, or has this year gone really fast?&nbsp; I feel like we just 
finished Christmas last year and now it&rsquo;s already come and gone 
again.&nbsp; I was just getting used to it being 2010 and before we know it 
we&rsquo;re going to be in 2011. I can&rsquo;t keep up!&nbsp; Someone told me 
that this awareness is a sign that I am getting old.&nbsp; Oh well, I guess 
getting older is better than the alternative.</p> 
<p>There is something very special about this time of year, particularly when 
you can see it through the eyes of a child.&nbsp; My daughter was so excited to 
open her advent calendar every morning and every day she asked how many more 
days until Christmas day.&nbsp; We successfully navigated the whole photo with 
Santa thing, which historically has always been a bit of a traumatic experience 
for my little one, but this year she happily handed him her Christmas list (and 
translated it for him).&nbsp; I couldn&rsquo;t quite make out what he said when 
her heard my six year old asking for an iTouch. When I was a child and sat on 
Santa&rsquo;s lap (apart from being scared out of my wits too) I would ask him 
for things like a doll or a cuddly toy or some pens.&nbsp; But Wii&rsquo;s and 
iTouches?&nbsp; My friend told me that her seven-year old just asked Santa for 
an iPad. &nbsp;&nbsp;Luckily the big man did not bring my daughter an iTouch 
this year &ndash; if he did we were going to have words.&nbsp; What happened to 
a Barbie, a fun jigsaw puzzle or a good book?&nbsp;</p> 
<p>My daughter also wants a puppy!&nbsp; I&rsquo;m now in the same position as 
parents all over the world, and our answer is: not for Christmas.&nbsp; 
Clarissa Baldwin, Chief Executive Officer of the Dog&rsquo;s Trust shelters in 
Britain coined the famous phrase, &lsquo;A Dog Is For Life, Not Just For 
Christmas,&rsquo; and since she did she has saved many lives.&nbsp; But the pet 
stores here in the States continue to enjoy a healthy trade over the Christmas 
season, with people still being conned into buying dogs before they are ready 
and being told that the puppies they are buying are not from the awful puppy 
mills shown on Oprah.&nbsp; No, they say these puppies come from breeders who 
care about where their puppies end up and who breed from good stock!&nbsp; All 
the pups come with impressive-looking papers touting all sorts of great 
heritage.&nbsp; And the public drink it up, spending hundreds of thousands of 
dollars on these puppies only to find they have health problems, behavior 
problems or they are just too much work.&nbsp; So where do the poor pups 
go?&nbsp; Not back to the store or the supposedly responsible breeders who seem 
to have forgotten how much they once cared.&nbsp; No, they&rsquo;ll end up in a 
shelter. &nbsp;Some of the pups will get lucky and be adopted by a loving 
family, but most will end up being euthanized along with the four million or so 
other dogs and cats put down in this country every year.&nbsp; How&rsquo;s that 
for a happy ending?&nbsp;</p> 
<p>I&rsquo;d like to take every CEO, manager, worker and middle man that works 
in the pet store puppy industry to watch all the euthanasias of the dogs that 
they previously sold.&nbsp; They&rsquo;d be kept so busy they wouldn&rsquo;t 
have time to enjoy all the money they made from the Holiday rush.&nbsp; I often 
wonder how they sleep at night knowing they are perpetuating the abuse and 
neglect of millions of puppy mill dogs in this country.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>When I was a young girl, I used to ask Santa for a puppy every year, but I 
never got one.&nbsp; I would get so upset that he never fulfilled my wish, but 
I didn&rsquo;t realize then that he was a lot wiser than I was, because he knew 
even though it was me who wanted the dog, my parents didn&rsquo;t have the time 
to look after one.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m glad I didn&rsquo;t make my daughter wait 
for thirty five years to have her own dog like I did, because watching her play 
with her beloved lab Sadie is a joy to behold, but I also won&rsquo;t get a dog 
just because she asked me for one.&nbsp; My husband and I waited a long time to 
have our own dog and made the decision to give Sadie a home only when we were 
ready and our lifestyles allowed for it.&nbsp; Now, three years later, 
we&rsquo;ve decided that 2011 is the time to add to our family.&nbsp; 
We&rsquo;re not sure what kind of dog we&rsquo;ll get, but we&rsquo;ll know 
when we meet him or her at the shelter.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
<p>During this holiday season I think about my wonderful family, how fortunate 
I have been in my life and career and how lucky I am to have the opportunity to 
help others through what I do.&nbsp; We at Positively have been working hard to 
shoot new episodes of<em>It's Me or the Dog</em> (new season premieres 
Saturday, Jan 8th!), develop exciting ideas and build our foundation so that we 
can help all the worthy causes that support pets and their people. &nbsp;2011 
is going to be a big year for us with many projects that everyone can 
enjoy.&nbsp; Stay tuned for future news and I wish everyone a wonderful holiday 
season and a Happy and Healthy New Year.</p> <br>

<h3>Tribute to Garry</h3> Posted by Victoria Stilwell - 12/02/10 at 11:12:18

<p></p> 
<p>I write this with a heavy heart.&nbsp; My good friend and training partner 
for many years died unexpectedly a few days ago.&nbsp; I am devastated at his 
loss and still can&rsquo;t quite believe that he is gone.&nbsp; The last time I 
saw him was in October at a fundraising event for the rescue group Stray from 
the Heart, in NYC.&nbsp; He had donated a dog photography session for the 
silent auction and his beautiful photos were on display.&nbsp; We had a lovely 
evening and he got to meet the wonderful Bernadette Peters, who has been a 
supporter of SFTH and other animal causes for many years.&nbsp; Even at seventy 
plus years old he looked so handsome in his leather jacket, making the women 
around him swoon, reminding me of the actor Sean Connery.&nbsp; People loved 
him because he was smart, funny, gentle, kind and caring.</p> 
<p>Garry Gross was a well known fashion photographer in New York City for many 
years.&nbsp; His amazing photos appeared in fashion magazines, advertisements 
and album covers all over the world.&nbsp; He lived a wonderfully hedonistic 
life, never managing to settle down and always on the go &ndash; he loved his 
profession. Garry&rsquo;s photographs, were to him, studies in art, but a 
decision to take on a job commissioned by a well known organization, proved to 
be his downfall.&nbsp; The resulting controversial photographs made headlines 
and years later, even after winning a court case regarding these photos, Garry 
was ostracized by the industry and never worked as a photographer again.&nbsp;
</p> 
<p>He decided to pursue a career with the other love of his life, dogs.&nbsp; 
He went to school and gained his certification as a trainer and that is when he 
came into my life.&nbsp; I was working as a trainer in Manhattan and Garry 
contacted me with a business proposition.&nbsp; I was skeptical at first, but 
as soon as I met him and saw his passion for dogs and training, I knew that he 
would be the perfect business partner for me.&nbsp; Together we created Dog 
Trainers of New York, a successful dog training company that in the last ten 
years has helped thousands of dogs and their people around the Tri-State 
area.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Garry lived in Greenwich Village and I used to love going down to see 
him.&nbsp; We would sit for hours in our favorite restaurants going through 
cases we had had, developing new ideas and comparing techniques.&nbsp; He was 
thirty years older than I was but his energy and enthusiasm was infectious and 
I never thought of him as an old man.&nbsp; He loved working together; loved my 
husband and my daughter and was so proud of me when my idea for a dog training 
television show came to fruition.&nbsp; He was a wonderfully supportive person 
who made everyone he was with feel special.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>After ten years of training Garry decided that he wanted to pursue 
photography again, but this time, photographing dogs, and the results were 
outstanding.&nbsp; He wanted to concentrate on showing the world how amazing 
dogs were through the magic of his camera lens.&nbsp; He was particularly 
focused on photographing rescue and senior dogs and his photos were nothing 
short of mesmerizing.</p> 
<p>Garry and I had begun to work on a project that he was very excited 
about.&nbsp; It was his dream to achieve this.&nbsp; Unfortunately he will not 
be here to realize his dream, but I am going to continue working on the project 
in his memory and make sure that one day his dream will be fulfilled.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Garry you made my life richer and I feel so fortunate to have known 
you.&nbsp; Thanks for all the great times we had and for all your support. I 
will miss you and love you forever.</p> <br>

<h3>Happy Thanksgiving!</h3> Posted by Victoria Stilwell - 11/24/10 at

<p></p> 
<p>Thanksgiving is one of my favorite holidays.&nbsp; Having never heard of 
Thanksgiving before I came to the States I wondered why it was such a big deal, 
but over the years I&rsquo;ve come to really appreciate the message that it 
sends &ndash; giving thanks for the good things in your life, connecting with 
family and eating lots!&nbsp; (It took me a while to get used to eating roast 
turkey in November since traditionally in England we only eat it on Christmas 
day, but I&rsquo;m not complaining now.)&nbsp; Fortunately, my family 
is&nbsp;very understanding when it comes to my lack of cooking talent, so I am 
never asked to do it.&nbsp;&nbsp;Who knows, though -&nbsp;maybe one year I will 
surprise them and pay them back for all of the delicious meals they have cooked 
for me over the years.</p> 
<p>This time of year I like to look back and think about what has happened 
throughout the year both in my personal and business life.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m now 
home for a while having just finished filming the third American series of<em>
It&rsquo;s Me or the Dog</em> in New York City and am happy to be home with my 
husband and daughter again while connecting with friends that I haven&rsquo;t 
seen for a long time.&nbsp; The new shows will start airing in early January 
and I&rsquo;m excited because I think this is going to be the best season 
yet.&nbsp; I have been challenged and tested by the situations I have 
encountered, but every new experience, however hard, forces me to improve my 
skills as a trainer&nbsp;and allows me to think outside the box while coming up 
with new and creative solutions that will benefit the dog and the 
family.&nbsp;&nbsp; Hopefully there's a little bit of entertainment that 
happens along the way as well.&nbsp; I love being challenged, and&nbsp; when I 
started filming the show six years ago I certainly never thought that 
after&nbsp;120 episodes I would still be able to come up with new ways of doing 
things.&nbsp; That just goes to show how flexible and workable positive 
reinforcement techniques can be.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>So as I&rsquo;m giving thanks this Thursday I thank God for my family, for 
having the chance to work with amazing animals and for giving me the 
opportunity to help show people in fifty countries the power of force-free 
training through my show.&nbsp; And I thank you all for&nbsp;watching because 
your support&nbsp;helps to spread the word and&nbsp;improve&nbsp;the lives of 
dogs and their people around the world.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>A blessed Thanksgiving to you all.</p>

<h3>Going Back Again&hellip;</h3> Posted by Victoria Stilwell - 11/23/10 at 
05:11:27 pm -14 Comments<br>

<p></p> 
<p>I love going back to England to see my family and visit all the places that 
meant so much to me growing up.&nbsp; My mother still lives in Wimbledon in the 
same house where I was raised, very close to the Wimbledon Tennis Championship 
grounds.&nbsp; Tennis was a big deal in my family and my father turned us all 
into reasonable players from an early age.&nbsp; I ended up playing for my 
university and was quickly named &lsquo;The Slammer&rsquo;- I hit very hard but 
the ball wasn&rsquo;t always that well controlled.&nbsp; My mother asked me 
once to play with her regular ladies four but I nearly took one of her 
friends&rsquo; heads off with an awe-inspiring cross court backhand and was 
never asked to play again.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Living so close to Wimbledon, I was able to watch world class players 
warming up before their games on the practice courts situated right behind my 
parents&rsquo; back yard.&nbsp; I saw everyone from Bjorn Borg to John McEnroe 
practice without realizing how lucky I was to be in such a privileged 
position.&nbsp; During the Wimbledon tournament it was always a thrill to go to 
the Centre Court.&nbsp; My father knew everyone who worked at the grounds so we 
would often get in for free finding any seat available to watch the stars 
play.&nbsp; Things have changed so much now and the grounds are almost 
unrecognizable from when I was young, but those memories of watching tennis 
with my father on the most famous court in the world, are very special.&nbsp; 
As I grew older I worked at the championship as a chauffer, driving players 
from their hotels to the stadium and during my final year at university I did 
personal security for all the tennis players including my idols, Navratilova 
and the great Steffi Graf.&nbsp; &nbsp;I had been given the job because at that 
point in my life I was interested in either becoming a police officer or going 
into personal protection, but that was before theatre and dogs really came into 
my life and changed my path forever.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>My father died in 2003 and I miss him every day.&nbsp; My mother had a tree 
planted for him in one of his favorite places, the Hurlingham Club, of which he 
was a member for 50 years.&nbsp; Hurlingham is an old private sports club that 
has a waiting list as long as your arm to become a member and is a slice of 
old, genteel England.&nbsp; Quiet and refined, it was the place that we would 
spend the weekend and while my parents played tennis, my sister and I would 
take off and explore the vast grounds right next to the River Thames.&nbsp; 
Again we had no idea how privileged we were to play in such an environment, but 
it was an important part of our protected world.&nbsp; Hurlingham is where I 
attended grand dances along with sons of lords and boys from Eton &ndash; the 
school for princes.&nbsp; I think my mother was secretly hoping that I would 
meet a prince or the son of a wealthy land owner, but even though there were a 
few hopefuls, I never really fit in with that social set and much preferred to 
get into my muck boots and walk my clients&rsquo; dogs on Wimbledon 
common.&nbsp; If I had become Lady Victoria in my vast manor house, no doubt I 
would have surrounded myself with dogs and horses, but then I would probably 
never have become a trainer and had the opportunities I now have to help dogs 
and their humans world wide.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>I&rsquo;m writing this because I have just returned from England again, 
visiting many places of my youth.&nbsp; Although so much has changed, these 
places remain important to me.&nbsp; My father&rsquo;s tree stands on the side 
of a small lake, in front of some tennis courts, with a plaque at the bottom to 
honor his memory.&nbsp; As I stand in front of his tree with my head full of 
memories I can see him playing tennis on the court behind me, intense and 
competitive, in his element and loving this sport that was so much part of his 
life.&nbsp; I miss you, Dad, and hope that wherever you may be, you are 
executing the perfect forehand or making your opponents crazy with the drop 
shots that you were so famous for.</p> <br>

<h3>It Doesn&rsquo;t Have to Happen</h3> Posted by Victoria Stilwell - 
11/08/10 at 03:11:46 pm -27 Comments<br>

<p></p> 
<p>Last week I did an interview with CNN's Headline News regarding a four day 
old infant that had just been killed by the family&rsquo;s pit bull in 
Jacksonville, Florida.&nbsp; Baby Justin was lying on the bed while his mother 
went to take a shower when the attack happened.&nbsp; The baby was taken to 
hospital where he died of his injuries and the pit bull was seized by animal 
control and euthanized the next day.&nbsp; First, my heart goes out to 
Justin&rsquo;s family.&nbsp; As a mother I cannot imagine the pain that they 
are going through at the moment.</p> 
<p>The family stated that their dog was very friendly and had no previous 
incidences of aggressive behavior, not even towards their other child, a four 
year old boy.&nbsp; An investigation is now underway to determine why the dog 
attacked and if there had been any warning signs.&nbsp; One of the points I 
made on the show, however, was something that I don&rsquo;t think was on other 
people&rsquo;s radars:&nbsp; Why was the most crucial piece of evidence in the 
case destroyed so quickly?&nbsp; You can interview the family all you like, 
their friends and neighbors.&nbsp; You can listen to the testimony of animal 
control who said that the dog was very aggressive when they went to pick him 
up.&nbsp; Well, that doesn&rsquo;t surprise me because what would you do if a 
group of strangers came into your home to take you away?&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sure 
that you would feel threatened and react in a negative way too.&nbsp; My 
question is: why was the dog euthanized before he was evaluated by a qualified 
behavioral specialist?&nbsp; The dog was put down less then twenty four hours 
after the attack had happened, so I don&rsquo;t believe that he was seen by 
anyone who was able to evaluate him properly and even if someone had seen him, 
twenty four hours is not enough time to do a thorough temperament test and an 
evaluation that would help determine why the attack happened. The dog might not 
have been behaving aggressively at all &ndash; in fact he might have just been 
stimulated by the infant&rsquo;s cries which could have sounded like a squeaky 
toy or a piece of prey to play with.&nbsp; All the &lsquo;might haves&rsquo; 
and &lsquo;could haves&rsquo; are now going to be just that because now the dog 
has been destroyed, we will never know.</p> 
<p>Let me be clear:&nbsp; I&rsquo;m not claiming that the dog was somehow a 
victim, nor am I defending him or his actions.&nbsp; I agree that the dog 
should have been put to sleep even if he had undergone the above-mentioned 
tests, but in order to avoid these kind of tragedies in the future, we have to 
find out more about what triggers such an apparently violent event so that we 
can build up a clearer picture of why a dog sometimes kills in this 
manner.&nbsp; I understand that it would be cruel to keep the dog alive for too 
long because of the stress it would be under being away from its family, and 
that getting a clear picture of behavior would be hard in a shelter 
environment, but if a professional had been able to study this dog, they would 
have come up with potentially valuable information that could be shared and 
used to prevent future attacks from happening.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Education is key, which is why I am developing a project that will spread 
the word about dogs and child safety, particularly for new mothers-to-be.&nbsp; 
Too many infants and young children are being mauled or killed by the family 
pet and it is time to take action and spread the message about safety and a 
parent&rsquo;s responsibility.&nbsp; &nbsp;When people like me advise that an 
infant or young child should never be left alone with a dog even for one 
second, we mean it!&nbsp; Dogs and young children do not mix well and the 
combination can be a recipe for disaster. &nbsp;&nbsp;Active supervision when 
both are in the same room together is crucial and separation when a parent is 
unable to supervise is a must.&nbsp; Follow those simple rules and babies like 
Justin will be kept out of harm&rsquo;s way.&nbsp; Life changes when a baby 
comes into the home and adjustments need to be made so that everyone in the 
household &ndash; including the new baby and the family pet &ndash; are safe 
and protected from each other.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>And to all of those calling out for the pitbull breeds to be banned, Breed 
Specific Legislation (BSL), does not work!&nbsp; Britain, other countries, and 
several US states have banned pitbulls and/or certain other breeds for decades 
and yet child deaths from dog attacks are continuing to rise.&nbsp; BSL 
addresses the wrong end of the leash.&nbsp; We need to be focusing on owners 
and their ultimate responsibility for the animal in their care.&nbsp; So 
regardless of how you feel about the politics of the debate, the end results of 
such legislation speak the loudest &ndash; BSL doesn&rsquo;t make the world a 
safer place.&nbsp; Let&rsquo;s concentrate on the deed and not the breed and 
give full focus to keeping children safe around all dogs.</p> <br>

<h3>Hooray for Puppy Mills!!</h3> Posted by Victoria Stilwell - 07/07/10 at

<p></p> 
<p>I&rsquo;m not a politician, and I have never claimed to be interested in or 
able to comprehend what I&rsquo;m sure are the delicate intricacies of how to 
create and enforce effective legislation.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m not big on telling 
people what they want to hear just for the sake of a few egos, and no one has 
ever accused me of being too soft on those I don&rsquo;t necessarily agree with.
</p> 
<p>What I do know about is common sense, and as disinterested in politics as I 
may be, I get pretty passionate about injustice and cruelty, especially towards 
those who can&rsquo;t protect themselves.&nbsp; Child abuse is the most heinous 
crime I can think of, and nothing will ever compare with my outright loathing 
of those who are guilty of it.&nbsp; Abuse against helpless animals is pretty 
far down the same road as child abuse, though, as far as I&rsquo;m 
concerned.&nbsp; In fact, much has been made lately of the link between animal 
abuse as a very common precursor to human-on-human (including children) crime.
</p> 
<p>That&rsquo;s why I literally fail to understand how any decent, moral 
self-respecting human being can oppose efforts to curb the horrific and cruel 
practice of puppy mills.&nbsp; Other than psychotic, neurologically damaged 
killers I honestly can&rsquo;t think of anyone I know who would prefer that 
puppy mills stay in business and be allowed to profit and thrive off the misery 
and pain of dogs.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>But I guess I don&rsquo;t know enough people or have severely misjudged the 
humane tendencies of human beings at large, because somehow, there are still 
those who oppose puppy mill reform to the point where they go out of their way 
to ensure that no new laws are passed to protect dogs from this form of 
cruelty.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s exactly what happened recently in North Carolina, 
where a perfectly reasonable (and actually somewhat watered-down) puppy mill 
reform bill was summarily killed by the state legislative process due to 
mindboggling, astoundingly stringent opposition from a few powerful lobbying 
groups.</p> 
<p>The bill was designed to &quot;eliminate abusive practices and provide for 
the humane care and treatment of dogs and puppies by establishing standards for 
their care at commercial breeding operations.&quot;&nbsp; That&rsquo;s 
it.&nbsp; Basically, it would have made sure that any breeding facility that 
had 15 or more breeding bitches and 30 or more puppies was subject to state 
regulation, licensing, oversight and humane practice requirements by the 
state.&nbsp;&nbsp; And some people thought that that was a bad idea worth 
fighting against.&nbsp; Unbelievable.</p> 
<p>Now I don&rsquo;t have any problem with respectable breeders who breed for 
the love of their particular breed and are concerned about raising puppies in 
the best possible way, maintaining a full regard for all their dogs&rsquo; 
mental and physical well-being.&nbsp; While I can&rsquo;t imagine why I would 
ever go to a breeder to get a new dog when there are so many wonderful pets 
waiting to be adopted in shelters (most of whom had originally come from puppy 
mills or breeders, by the way), I understand those that do, and don&rsquo;t 
look down upon them at all.&nbsp; What I do have a problem with are people who 
go out of their way to actively oppose efforts to ensure the well-being of 
domesticated dogs.</p> 
<p>The North Carolina puppy mill bill (SB460) was killed before it could get 
to a vote because several lobbying groups brought their considerable power to 
bear on those who were trying to pass the bill and save dogs&rsquo; 
lives.&nbsp; The groups who have proudly announced their opposition to and 
relish their role in the ultimate defeat (for now) of the bill include the 
National Rifle Association and (amazingly) the North Carolina Pork 
Council.&nbsp; PORK!!!??!!&nbsp; RIFLES??!!!?&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Now I can tell you that I enjoy eating bacon as much as the next girl from 
time to time, and a good hearty debate about the right to bear arms is what 
Americans&rsquo; right to free speech is all about, but I&rsquo;m not going to 
get into that now because it&rsquo;s not relevant to a blog post about puppy 
mills.</p> 
<p>OH WAIT&hellip;&nbsp; Pork and guns <em>ARE</em> suddenly a part of the 
discussion about puppy mills, because amazingly those who lobby on behalf of 
pork and guns have thrust themselves into the debate and (for some completely 
inexplicable reason) decided that a bill designed to curb abuses against dogs 
in puppy mills is a threat to those they represent (pork farmers and fans of 
guns).&nbsp; I may not be a genius, but I like to think I have decent head on 
my shoulders, and still I just don&rsquo;t understand this.</p> 
<p>The NRA and the Pork Council have gone so far as to actually say that they 
have more of a problem with those who sponsor the bill than the bill 
itself.&nbsp; So basically they&rsquo;re willing to let their fear of those in 
support of the bill dictate their stance on whether or not they&rsquo;re ok 
letting dogs languish in abject misery in puppy mills.&nbsp; &nbsp;The NRA want 
to protect the rights of hobby breeders, especially those that breed sporting 
hounds, while the Pork Council believe that the main goal of this bill&rsquo;s 
backers is not so much about puppies but is actually a more sinister plot to 
eventually force the entire country to stop ever eating meat again!&nbsp; 
Brilliant.</p> 
<p>All I can think is that these groups feel that a simple bill to crack down 
on puppy mills is somehow an assault on their way of life.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t 
see how that could ever be the case, and I don&rsquo;t think that makes any 
sense, but it&rsquo;s the only explanation I can come up with for why they 
would obstruct laws opposing puppy mills.&nbsp; Unless they really do just hate 
puppies.</p> 
<p>I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s a group in the world that I agree with 
100% of the time on 100% of the issues.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sure the Pork Council 
and the NRA have played some roles in making the world a better place from time 
to time, but on this issue, they&rsquo;re dead wrong, and this time 
they&rsquo;re exposing their willingness to put themselves, their greed and 
their egos ahead of the well being of defenseless domesticated animals.&nbsp; 
These aren&rsquo;t chickens, pigs, cows or even fish (and yes, I do believe all 
animals should be treated better even if they are being bred for their meat) 
&ndash; these are pet dogs and if we can&rsquo;t come together to try and 
protect them, then what next?</p> 
<p>Amazingly, even the American Kennel Club has voiced strong opposition to 
puppy mill bills in the past, presumably fearing that the more stringent laws 
on puppy farmers will trickle down to their registered breeders as well, 
causing them to be subject to stricter licensing and humane treatment laws. 
&nbsp;They might also be worried that less breeders will be paying to register 
their puppies via the AKC which would mean less money for the AKC.&nbsp; And 
here&rsquo;s silly old me thinking that kennel clubs in general were 
organizations that were designed to put dogs&rsquo; well-being first. &nbsp;If 
a registered breeder is doing what they&rsquo;re supposed to, I don&rsquo;t see 
why more oversight would be a problem for the AKC or its breeders.&nbsp; If 
you&rsquo;ve got nothing to hide, then you&rsquo;ve got no problem showing what 
you&rsquo;ve got.&nbsp; If anything, more oversight would help the legitimate 
breeders, as they would have official status and stamps of approval as humane 
breeders.</p> 
<p>The bill&rsquo;s opponents also say there are already laws on the books in 
North Carolina that deal with the issue of animal abuse and puppy mills.&nbsp; 
Hmmmm.&nbsp; I guess they missed the fact that the current bill was inspired 
from the recent rescue of 300 dogs from a North Carolina puppy mill.&nbsp; The 
current stuff&rsquo;s not working, Einstein.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>So here&rsquo;s an idea:&nbsp; why don&rsquo;t the NRA and Pork Council 
bring their considerable power to the table on behalf of pet dogs in puppy 
mills and find a way to give whatever legislation currently exists the teeth it 
needs to identify bad breeders and hold them accountable?&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;That&rsquo;s an honest challenge to those opposed to puppy mill 
reform:&nbsp; you fix the puppy mill problem however you want, so long as the 
following issues are resolved including:&nbsp;</p> 
<ul> 
<li>dogs being kept in small cages all their life</li> 
<li>dogs having no social interaction with other dogs or humans</li> 
<li>dogs that develop genetically-based diseases due to incestuous breeding 
practices</li> 
<li>dogs that have their vocal cords ripped out to stop their incessant barking
</li> 
<li>dogs living in and among their own feces and urine in cages stacked on top 
of each other</li> 
<li>dogs that don&rsquo;t know how to walk on solid ground after having spent 
their entire lives in wire cages.</li> </ul> 
<p>&nbsp;You opponents of puppy mill legislation come up with your own 
solution to the above problems that don&rsquo;t conflict with your love of pork 
chops and shotguns, and you&rsquo;ll be absolved.&nbsp; If you don&rsquo;t, 
though, we&rsquo;ll know where you stand:&nbsp; you&rsquo;re ok with abuse to 
puppies and dogs.&nbsp; It really couldn&rsquo;t be any simpler than that.</p>

<h3>Weed Addiction</h3> Posted by Victoria Stilwell - 04/22/10 at 08:04:25 am -

<p></p> 
<p>My dog Sadie is addicted to weed.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s gotten so bad that 
we&rsquo;ve had to have several interventions (which, as evidenced by the fact 
that there have been a few, obviously means they haven&rsquo;t been entirely 
successful).&nbsp; She doesn&rsquo;t necessarily admit to having a problem, but 
then I guess that&rsquo;s to be expected.&nbsp; When one is under the fierce 
grip of such an insidious vice, it can often be hard to see the forest for the 
trees.&nbsp; When I think of her addiction issues, the age-old witticism comes 
to mind:&nbsp; Denial ain&rsquo;t just a river in Egypt.&nbsp; No, I 
don&rsquo;t think Sadie thinks she has a problem at all &ndash; in fact, she 
seems to be perfectly oblivious to our concern for her well-being.</p> 
<p>Of course, by &lsquo;weed&rsquo;, I don&rsquo;t mean marijuana, but rather 
the clover, nutsedge and the countless other grassy weeds that seem to sprout 
up everywhere around this time of year.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve become resigned to 
it:&nbsp; my dog loves to eat grass.&nbsp; She is obsessed.&nbsp; Won&rsquo;t 
stop chomping away whenever we&rsquo;re outside.&nbsp; The local city 
government ought to be paying us for the free grazing service our dog provides 
every day on each walk through our local park.</p> 
<p>Every off-leash walk in our neighborhood has become an opportunity to 
support her otherwise very healthy diet with a variety of the delicious grasses 
the Southeastern United States has to offer.&nbsp; She really likes the tall, 
wispy reeds, and has lately begun to avoid the clumpy clover-like weeds.&nbsp; 
She is now perfectly aware of our disapproval of this dietary trend, and looks 
at us from the corner of her beautiful brown eyes while she feasts madly, as if 
we hadn&rsquo;t fed her in a week and a half.&nbsp; As we approach her to stop 
her from eating, the pace of her chomping speeds up in a desperate effort to 
get every last scrumptious morsel of green in her gut before running off to the 
next patch.&nbsp; All this excitement usually comes to an unseemly conclusion 
which usually results in me using my poop bag or two sticks to pull the 
inevitably stuck, grass-ridden poop from her behind while she looks around at 
me with a look that says &ldquo;I kinda think I understand that you&rsquo;re 
trying to help me here, but this is really awkward and no fun.&rdquo;&nbsp; One 
thing that is fairly certain in Sadie&rsquo;s case is that like most dogs, the 
memory span relating to her cognitive reasoning is not nearly long enough for 
her to understand the correlation between eating grass and having to endure 
another manual poo extraction exercise.&nbsp; So much fun.</p> 
<p>I used to be concerned when dogs (my own or otherwise) ate grass.&nbsp; How 
many times have we all heard that dogs only eat grass if they have an upset 
stomach?&nbsp; That they&rsquo;re only eating grass in an effort to make 
themselves throw up?&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve had to dispel the generalizations of that 
myth countless times with fellow dogwalkers in the park.&nbsp; Inevitably, they 
look on sadly while my Sadie chomps away at her greenery, offering their 
steadfastly ominous advice about the fact that she must be unwell and casting 
furtive glances at me that seem to say &ldquo;you obviously must not be feeding 
your dog a nutritious diet.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Dogs eat grass for many reasons, only one of which is occasionally that 
their stomach is upset and needs emptying.&nbsp; Far more often, the dog simply 
likes the taste of grass.&nbsp; Occasionally, an incomplete diet can result in 
this craving, but more often than not the dog simply likes eating grass for the 
fun of it - just like Sadie.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>So while I may feel that a good portion of our daily walk time is 
unnecessarily taken up with boring grass-eating, Sadie is happy and healthy, 
and that&rsquo;s the most important thing.&nbsp; I just wish I didn&rsquo;t 
have to deal with the grass when it comes out the other end&hellip;.</p> <br>

<h3>Fact vs Fiction, Part II</h3> Posted by Victoria Stilwell - 04/06/10 at 
08:04:23 am -23 Comments<br>

<p></p> 
<p>A couple of weeks ago, I posted the first part of my 'Fact versus Fiction' 
blog.&nbsp; There are so many myths and misunderstandings out there about the 
science and reality of dog behavior, I thought I would try to help clear up a 
few more things here in part II.</p> 
<p><strong><em>Myth:</em></strong>&nbsp; Positive reinforcement cannot be used 
on more severe behavioral cases such as aggressive dogs.</p> 
<p><strong><em>Fact:</em></strong>&nbsp; Actually, this is where positive 
reinforcement methods are most effective.&nbsp; Using positive reinforcement to 
treat &lsquo;red zone&rsquo; dogs is not only a safer option, but a much more 
effective one.&nbsp; Aggression is a dog&rsquo;s way of protecting himself and 
his resources, and is deeply rooted in fear for survival, fear of loss of 
comfort, a desire to repel a perceived threat and is a great way to control 
space and environment.&nbsp; Aggression is therefore deeply rooted in 
insecurity.&nbsp; Punish an insecure dog and you make that dog even more 
insecure even though it looks like he is behaving better.&nbsp; When a 
dominance trainer works with an aggressive dog and uses punitive techniques to 
get a dog to submit or &lsquo;calm down,&rsquo; not only is that dog using an 
instinctive survival tool of &lsquo;shut down&rsquo; to make the person stop 
whatever they are doing, a dominance trainer will then label the dog&rsquo;s 
non-reaction and &lsquo;calmness&rsquo; as a success.&nbsp; People love 
successes, especially when they are achieved quickly and they look very 
impressive, but those of us who really know what is going on shake our heads in 
dismay because not only has the dog been mishandled, the person has been misled 
into thinking that their dog has been &lsquo;fixed&rsquo; or 
&lsquo;cured&rsquo;.&nbsp; The other reaction a dog has to being manhandled 
through dominance techniques is to lash out and bite the trainer or owner in 
anger, frustration and/or fear in order to get that person away from 
them.&nbsp; The person is hurt, the dog is then punished again, and this 
destructive cycle is repeated.</p> 
<p>Aggression in dogs needs to be handled sensitively and with 
compassion.&nbsp; Aggressive dogs are under stress and this stress needs to be 
managed so that the dog can feel better while the trainer finds the cause of 
the aggressive response and then works with the dog and the owner to modify 
it.&nbsp; Far from using force or punitive techniques, a dog is guided by using 
positive techniques that help him see a perceived threat or potential loss of a 
valued resource in a different light.&nbsp; For some dogs this can be achieved 
relatively quickly but for others it can take a while, which is why it is 
important to see every dog and every situation as unique.&nbsp; Positive 
reinforcement is the best philosophy to use in these cases but there are many 
methods within this one philosophy that can be used, making positive 
reinforcement a much safer and more reliable method to use on even &lsquo;red 
zone&rsquo; dogs.&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong><em>Myth:</em></strong> &nbsp;Dominance training is much safer 
because it has quicker results and for an aggressive dog anything that works 
quickly means that the dog is safer for humans to be around.</p> 
<p><strong><em>Fact:</em></strong>&nbsp; This is a flawed and dangerous way to 
think.&nbsp; This &lsquo;quick fix&rsquo; idea demeans a dog&rsquo;s experience 
and is psychologically unachievable.&nbsp; A dog&rsquo;s emotional brain is 
wired in exactly the same way as that of a human.&nbsp; Yes, exactly the same 
way.&nbsp; So his physiological response to emotion is the same as ours, which 
means that our bodies have the same internal reaction to emotions such as fear, 
joy, excitement etc.&nbsp; When a dog is suffering from anxiety or fear that 
provokes a negative behavior such as aggression, then it is sheer foolishness 
to profess that by punishing a dog, the dog is fixed.&nbsp; This is dangerous 
and fundamentally wrong, I can&rsquo;t put it clearer than that.&nbsp; If a 
human has an anxiety problem chances are they will seek out therapy to help 
them.&nbsp; That therapy does not work in one go (and certainly didn&rsquo;t in 
the past when therapies were punitive) and it takes time to work through an 
anxiety and change the way a human feels about something.&nbsp; It is exactly 
the same for a dog because time is needed to really change the way a dog feels 
emotionally.&nbsp; Punitive training just puts a band aid on the problem but 
the dog still feels the same inside if not more insecure for the punishment he 
has received for &lsquo;behaving badly&rsquo;.</p> 
<p><strong><em>Myth:</em></strong> &nbsp;There are two different behavioral 
philosophies that you can use to train dogs - positive reinforcement or 
dominance training and both are equally effective.</p> 
<p><strong><em>Fact:</em></strong>&nbsp; There are many great training methods 
and many different effective and humane ways to train dogs, but all of those 
methods fall under one general behavioral philosophy &ndash; Positive 
Reinforcement.&nbsp; For some reason, though,&nbsp;a lot of people still don't 
like hearing&nbsp;trainers say that it's not ok to train your dog using any 
method that &quot;works&quot;.&nbsp; Using that heavy-handed logic, it would 
be&nbsp;ok do just about anything to a dog if it meant they 
stopped&nbsp;misbehaving right then and there&nbsp;- there are more effective, 
safe and humane ways of doing things.&nbsp; I believe that there are many 
fantastic methods and approaches that can be used to effectively change dogs' 
behavior, but I also firmly believe that all of those methods have one thing in 
common - a general basis in the principles of positive reinforcement and 
force-free training.&nbsp; Things change.&nbsp; We evolve and learn.&nbsp; As a 
society, we've agreed to move forward in&nbsp;an effort to&nbsp;develop a 
better&nbsp;understanding of ourselves and our planet - why the resistance to 
apply that sense of development to our understanding of animals in general and 
dog behavior in particular?&nbsp; I can ony guess that those who refuse to 
accept that we now know better than to use force to dominate do so because 
they're either uninformed or because they actually derive pleasure from 'being 
the boss' of another being.&nbsp; If it's the former, then fair enough - that's 
why I've developed this site:&nbsp; to inform.&nbsp; If it's the latter, 
however, I have no patience for these people and view their rationale and 
motivations for such behavior as&nbsp;a sign of tremendous insecurity and 
weakness.</p> 
<p>I advise owners to walk away from dominance trainers.&nbsp; Dominance 
methods are destructive and when it comes to training dogs, positive 
reinforcement is the only truly effective and humane&nbsp;philosophy for all 
the reasons listed above.&nbsp; This Positively site is the online home for 
positive reinforcement and I am so proud to have the best in the business 
blogging here.&nbsp; But don&rsquo;t think for a moment that these or any other 
positive trainers are weak.&nbsp; We treat and train dogs with kindness and 
respect because we know that only through practice, scientific research and 
discovery can we truly understand a dog&rsquo;s behavior and help to mould and 
change it if needed without using forceful or punitive methods.&nbsp; We are 
like-minded people that deal with dog behavior every day, and most importantly, 
we see the positive results that our training methods have both for the dogs we 
use them on and for the people that love them.</p> <br>

<h3>Fact vs Fiction, Part I</h3> Posted by Victoria Stilwell - 03/22/10 at 
07:03:05 pm -34 Comments<br>

<p></p> 
<p>I want to dispel a few myths about positive reinforcement training 
methods.&nbsp; There seems to be a great deal of confusion as to what positive 
reinforcement really is and about which dogs and behaviors it is useful for. 
&nbsp;For example, I have heard people say that positive reinforcement trainers 
only deal with obedience training, but when it comes to severe behavioral 
issues such as aggression, dominance training methods are the only ones that 
really work because they are more in tune with a dog&rsquo;s basic 
psychology.&nbsp; Nothing could be further from the truth so I thought it was 
time to lay out the facts about positive training and explain why dominance 
theorists and practitioners have it so wrong.&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong><em>Myth:</em></strong>&nbsp; Positive reinforcement trainers only 
use food as rewards, which is a form of bribery.&nbsp; A dog should never be 
bribed into doing something for food but should obey their owners because they 
want to make their owners happy.&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong><em>Fact:</em></strong> &nbsp;This is something that I hear often 
but comes from those who do not understand how powerful positive training 
is.&nbsp; Food is used as a reward especially for a dog that is food motivated, 
but rewards such as toys, praise and play can be just as powerful if a dog 
happens to be motivated by them.&nbsp; The bottom line here is that a reward 
that motivates a dog to learn is a great training tool because learning not 
only makes a dog more confident and able to live successfully in a domestic 
environment, it also encourages mutual understanding that increases the 
human/animal bond. &nbsp;That is not bribery.&nbsp; If a dog sees that there 
are pleasurable consequences for a behavior then he is more likely to repeat 
the behavior because doing so makes him feel good.&nbsp; When a person is 
attached to that good feeling there is more likelihood of the dog listening and 
responding to whatever that person asks of him.&nbsp; That is why I have never 
understood why people choose to train their dogs using force and 
punishment.&nbsp; The dog might behave and do what the human asks but only 
because he has learned that not behaving will cause a negative reaction in his 
human and that needs to be avoided at all costs. &nbsp;Not a good place to be!
</p> 
<p>Food also has the power to help a fearful or anxious dog overcome his 
fears.&nbsp; When food is presented to a fearful dog in the presence of a 
stimulus that causes that fear or anxiety, the smell and taste of the food 
bypasses all other parts of the brain and goes straight to the brain&rsquo;s 
emotional center, the amygdala.&nbsp; Instead of feeling fear, the brain begins 
to be overcome with not just the pleasurable feelings that food gives but also 
allows the dog to focus more on the good sensation and less on the negative 
emotion.&nbsp; Food is incompatible with fear and is therefore a valuable tool 
in modifying a dog&rsquo;s fear, anxiety and stress.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong><em>Myth:</em></strong> &nbsp;A dog will only respond to food 
rewards and will ignore you if you don&rsquo;t have food in your hand.</p> 
<p><strong><em>Fact:</em></strong>&nbsp; Any reward that is used to motivate 
the dog to learn has to be of high value until the dog is responding 
reliably.&nbsp; When this has been achieved the high reward, such as food, 
should be used intermittently.&nbsp; That means the dog doesn&rsquo;t get 
rewarded with the food every time he responds to a cue, but the next time he 
responds he might just get it.&nbsp; Then the next couple of times he responds, 
a lower-value reward such as praise will be used, but the dog continues to 
respond.&nbsp; In fact intermittent reinforcement like this actually makes a 
dog respond faster and more reliably because it is based on the same theory 
that makes a slot machine in a casino so addictive.&nbsp; It would be wonderful 
if a slot machine gave out money every time you played it but unfortunately 
that doesn&rsquo;t happen.&nbsp; The promise, however, that you could win the 
jackpot the next time you play makes you want to play even more until the slot 
machine pays out.&nbsp; This is how dogs really learn so even if you 
don&rsquo;t give a food reward every time, the possibility of the potential of 
one in the future makes a dog work much harder.&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong><em>Myth:</em></strong>&nbsp; Positive trainers do not use 
discipline.</p> 
<p><strong><em>Fact:</em></strong>&nbsp; Positive does not mean 
permissive.&nbsp; Discipline is an important part of the learning process, but 
the form of discipline used in positive training differs greatly from the type 
of discipline used in dominance training.&nbsp; Such dominance-based discipline 
uses force and hard punishment such as &lsquo;alpha rolls (when a dog is 
forcibly laid on its back and side and held down until it 
&lsquo;submits&rsquo;), &lsquo;biting&rsquo; (where a person uses the tips of 
&nbsp;their fingers bunched together that are poked into a dog&rsquo;s side in 
order to simulate a &lsquo;bite&rsquo; that a dog would use to reprimand 
another dog), foot pushes (where a person uses the side of their foot or heel 
to prod or kick a dog when it is misbehaving), hanging (where a dog is hung by 
his collar until his air supply is cut off), &nbsp;and shock collars that 
deliver an electric shock when the dog misbehaves.&nbsp; Positive training uses 
constructive discipline to<em>guide</em> the dog into making better choices 
rather than scaring or inflicting pain.&nbsp; Hard punishments used by 
dominance trainers are not only cruel but are also potentially dangerous and 
damage the trust between dog and human. Again, dominance trainers will argue 
that these are effective methods of punishment because they stop dogs from 
repeating negative behavior, and they are right to a point.&nbsp; The 
punishment is most likely to work there and then, but the experience of the 
punishment can make dogs feel more insecure and wary of their owners and it is 
common for dogs that are punished in this manner to keep reoffending because 
they haven&rsquo;t been shown that there is another way to behave.&nbsp; The 
only thing harsh punishment does achieve is to make the person feel better 
because they have gained control even if it meant dominating the dog into 
submission. That might be fine for some people, and unfortunately there are 
those that actually don&rsquo;t mind using hard punishment.&nbsp; I not only 
feel sorry for the dogs that such people come into contact with but also sorry 
for those people for being so misguided.&nbsp; I have said in previous articles 
that I believe people who train their dogs using dominance techniques show a 
great weakness within themselves.&nbsp; Anyone can get a dog to behave using 
punitive training but it takes a real understanding of dog psychology to use 
discipline effectively without inflicting pain or fear and to guide a dog into 
not repeating negative behavior while maintaining trust between dog and 
person.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>I believe that dogs should learn just as much from constructive discipline 
as they do from reward.&nbsp; Disciplinary techniques such as removal, time 
outs, taking something of value away, ignoring behavior and interrupting 
negative behavior with a vocal interrupter can be extremely effective, and I 
use these techniques on all kinds of dogs with all kinds of issues.&nbsp; It is 
so much better to be able to influence an animal&rsquo;s behavior without using 
force, which is why positive reinforcement methods really do offer a better 
alternative to outdated and abusive dominance theory.</p> 
<p><strong><em>Myth:</em></strong>&nbsp; Aggressive dogs are trying to be 
dominant.</p> 
<p><strong><em>Fact:</em></strong>&nbsp; Let me say this once.&nbsp; Contrary 
to what some trainers might lead you to believe &ndash; dogs are not out to 
achieve world domination!!!&nbsp; Dominance theory relies heavily on the idea 
that if a dog is being aggressive, controlling or just behaving badly then it 
must be trying to dominate the owner.&nbsp; While domination does happen in the 
canine world, it shows another real misunderstanding of dog behavior to label 
everything a dog does as an attempt to be top dog or boss over a human.&nbsp; 
If a dog is exhibiting controlling behavior in or out of the home, chances are 
that he hasn&rsquo;t been taught how to behave appropriately.&nbsp; If a dog 
hasn&rsquo;t been taught how to function in a domestic environment he will 
behave in the only way he knows how.&nbsp; He might control access to food, 
space or furniture by aggressing at a human only because he is insecure and 
hasn&rsquo;t been given the confidence to know that there is no need to guard 
these resources.&nbsp; Dogs guard and control for fear that they will lose 
access to their comfort and what makes them feel good and not because they want 
to dominate humans and the household, yet for so long these kinds of behaviors 
have been grossly misunderstood.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is just one example of how 
dominance trainers get it so wrong and then impart this flawed knowledge onto 
dog owners who believe what they are told because it comes from a person that 
is supposed to know what he or she is doing.</p>

<h3>Welcome to Positively!</h3> Posted by Victoria Stilwell - 01/20/10 at

<p></p> 
<p>Hello and welcome to the new online home of positive reinforcement dog 
training!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve been planning the development of this website ever 
since it became clear to me that a unified voice was needed to help let the 
public know that there&rsquo;s a better way to train their dogs&hellip; 
Positively!</p> 
<p>For the past five years, I&rsquo;ve filmed almost 100 episodes of my show, 
<em>It&rsquo;s Me or the Dog</em>.&nbsp; When I first started shooting, 
positive reinforcement was still the dog training philosophy with the most 
momentum in terms of educating the public about training methods based on 
modern behavioral science.&nbsp; For the past 40 or so years, amazing trainers 
and behaviorists like Ian Dunbar, Patricia McConnell, Karen Pryor, Nick Dodman 
(all of whom deliver their fantastic knowledge as Expert Bloggers on this 
site!) and many others have been moving the needle of public awareness away 
from the traditional, yank-em-crank-em, dominate-your-dog-into-submission style 
of dog training and towards the use of positive reinforcement.&nbsp; This 
gradual shift had been gaining in popularity and awareness, as more and more 
people continue to see positive results while building mutual trust and respect 
with their dogs.&nbsp; Most dog owners prefer to train their dogs using rewards 
and constructive discipline, rather than using more punitive training methods, 
because they want their dog to WANT to behave rather than having their dog 
behave only because he is scared of what will happen to him if he doesn&rsquo;t.
</p> 
<p>A lot of this may seem like common sense, especially when you see the 
parallel progress we&rsquo;ve made as a society in the way we raise our 
children.&nbsp; Of course dogs are not children, but many of the same general 
behavioral philosophies apply &ndash; using reward to reinforce positive 
behavior and discipline to guide rather than to instill fear. &nbsp;Modern 
behavioral science has shown that dogs have a lot more in common with us humans 
than people and trainers may have thought 50 years ago &ndash; they feel 
emotions similar to ours (fear, anger, joy, excitement, social insecurity, even 
love) &ndash; so it&rsquo;s important to understand that many of the same basic 
philosophies we use now with children can be applied successfully to training 
your dog.</p> 
<p>As clear as this issue may seem, unfortunately there are still those who 
use dominance-based techniques to train dogs.&nbsp; There is less of an 
emphasis on understanding WHY a behavior is occurring and more of a desire to 
get a &lsquo;quick fix&rsquo; and suppress bad behavior with punitive 
means.&nbsp; The dangerous thing about doing this is that quick fixes can 
quickly come unstuck.&nbsp; The dog might not be doing the behavior because it 
is afraid of his owner&rsquo;s reaction, but he still feels the same way 
inside, and one day those feelings will come to the surface again, and even 
more intensely than before.&nbsp; Similarly, dominance trainers will often 
treat &lsquo;fire with fire&rsquo; in the sense that they combat what are most 
commonly insecurity or fear-based issues, such as aggression, with punitive 
methods that create more fear.&nbsp; Some may say that the dogs aren&rsquo;t 
fearful of a dominance trainer, but when you really look at it, you can see the 
difference.&nbsp; For example a dominance trainer will often 
&lsquo;flood&rsquo; a dog who is anxious and aggressive around other dogs, by 
forcing the dog into a situation where it is surrounded by lots of dogs it 
doesn&rsquo;t know, forcing the dog to refrain from responding when inundated 
with that stimulus the dog fears most until the dog &lsquo;submits&rsquo; to 
the fact that there&rsquo;s nothing he can do.&nbsp; The dog doesn&rsquo;t 
react when it is surrounded by all the other dogs and the technique is 
therefore labeled a great success &ndash; the dog is cured!&nbsp; But what 
would you do if you as a human were scared of other humans and had a habit of 
lashing out at people walking past in an effort to get them away from you, but 
were then forced into an environment where you were surrounded by thirty or 
more people?&nbsp; Would you lash out in that scenario or would you be worried 
that if you did you would get attacked back?&nbsp; Chances are if you&rsquo;re 
smart and want to survive, you are going to shut down and not do anything until 
you are out of that situation and in your comfort zone again.&nbsp; Then your 
reaction to just one person going past you might be even worse because the 
stress and trauma you felt being flooded by so many people has made your fear 
worse.</p> 
<p>The same dog being treated with positive reinforcement would slowly be 
desensitized to the presence of other dogs in a controlled environment with 
constant praise and rewards whenever he had a calm response.&nbsp; Eventually, 
more dogs are added and the dog is set up for success by teaching it to 
literally feel differently about the presence of that which once caused such a 
fearful response.&nbsp; It may take a little longer, but it&rsquo;s safer and, 
more importantly, humane and effective for the dog.</p> 
<p>A main reason why I think a lot of dominance trainers take the approach 
that they do is because if they do take the time to find out why a situation is 
occurring they often fundamentally misdiagnose what is causing the problem in 
the first place.&nbsp; If a dog is aggressive then often that aggression is 
attributed to a dog trying to be an &lsquo;alpha dog&rsquo; or boss of all the 
other dogs.&nbsp; In order to treat this aggression the dog will often be 
&lsquo;put in its place&rsquo; with punitive methods such as &lsquo;alpha 
rolls,&rsquo; where a dog is forcibly put onto its back or side and held there 
by the owner until it submits, so that it recognizes that it is not the 
alpha.&nbsp; But think about it &ndash; most aggressive response is not a 
dog&rsquo;s attempt to usurp others, but a demonstration of a lack of 
confidence and insecurity.&nbsp; Punishing that insecurity just serves to 
increase the insecurity even more.&nbsp; &nbsp;The aggressive behavior might 
look confident and dominant but there is always an underlying discomfort.&nbsp; 
Think of the bully in the playground.&nbsp; Is the child who bullies other 
children a secure or insecure child?&nbsp; Nine times out of ten the bully is 
the insecure kid.&nbsp; Confident children don&rsquo;t feel the need to bully, 
and the same dynamic can be said of dogs.&nbsp; Misdiagnosing the reason for 
the aggression and suppressing that aggression with punitive training means 
that the dog is made even more insecure and that insecurity has the potential 
to surface again, possibly more violently than before.&nbsp; A positive 
reinforcement trainer will recognize that most aggression is not a dog trying 
to be alpha but a dog that is aggressing because it is trying to control 
situations or stimuli around him that make him feel uncomfortable.&nbsp; The 
positive trainer will then find non threatening ways to train the dog to feel 
more comfortable around the stimuli, with the result that this confidence means 
there is no need for the dog to behave aggressively.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Sometimes this debate can get frustrating, because so much of the positive 
reinforcement argument is based on common sense.&nbsp; Unfortunately there are 
still a lot of owners and trainers out there who feel that their machismo or 
manliness might be called into question if they do anything that&rsquo;s 
misperceived as letting a dog be the &lsquo;pack leader&rsquo; over them.&nbsp; 
To those, this debate is likely a lost cause and destined to go nowhere since 
we&rsquo;d ultimately be debating two completely different things, but I and 
the rest of the Positively community will continue our efforts to bring 
awareness of positive reinforcement back to the forefront of the popular 
consciousness. I see progress being made every day on both small and large 
scales.&nbsp; Have a look around this site, read the other wonderful Expert 
Blogger entries, and come back often to check for new info.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Lastly, if your dog were to choose how it would like to learn, would it 
choose reward based positive training or more punitive, dominance 
methods?&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sure I know what my answer would be.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Dogs that jump</h3> Posted by Victoria Stilwell - 06/15/08 at 05:06:22 pm -

<p></p> 
<p>I am fortunate to receive letters from dog owners all over the world. My 
show- &lsquo;It&rsquo;s Me or the Dog,&rsquo; has been broadcast in over twenty 
countries and fortunately the message of responsible ownership is also 
spreading to far off places such as Brazil, Dubai and Hong Kong. If I 
personally answered all the training questions I receive from dog owners I 
would be spending the next two years on my computer. I don&rsquo;t have the 
luxury of time, so I will attempt to answer some frequently asked questions via 
this blog.</p> 
<p>What doesn&rsquo;t surprise me is that dog owners all over the world have 
the same problems. I receive letters asking for advice on anything from 
housetraining to destructive chewing, from aggression to jumping up on 
visitors. Some owners are mildly irritated by their dog&rsquo;s bad behaviour, 
while others are at their wit&rsquo;s end and ready to send the dog to a 
shelter.&nbsp; However it continually amazes me that many owners still have 
very little knowledge about how to deal with their dog&rsquo;s behaviour.&nbsp; 
There is such a wealth of great training information available, yet it seems 
few people tap into it. Please don&rsquo;t let this stop you writing for advice 
because I feel very honoured to be in a position where I can help to improve 
dogs&rsquo; lives with their owners and vice versa. But I would urge you to 
take advantage of valuable information that is readily available in books, 
videos and from good trainers, making sure that you stay away from any that are 
punitive or unkind to the dog.&nbsp; There are still many ignorant 
&lsquo;traditional&rsquo; trainers out there that think the best way to train a 
dog is to make it submissive towards them using harsh methods such as choke 
collars, prong collars, Alpha rolls, hitting, physical manipulation and other 
appalling techniques and devices such as the shock collar. SHAME ON THEM. There 
are, however, many wonderful trainers that use positive reward methods. If your 
dog has a behaviour problem that you don&rsquo;t know how to deal with and you 
need help &ndash; invest in one of these trainers.&nbsp; It will change all 
your lives for the better.</p> 
<p>One frequent question I get asked is how to stop a dog from jumping up on 
people when they come into the house? I always start by asking the same 
question, &lsquo;why do you think the dog is jumping up?&rsquo;</p> 
<p>Dogs jump for many reasons. Don&rsquo;t we like to see people&rsquo;s faces 
when we say hello? Jumping while greeting is a great way for a dog to get your 
attention. Some dogs will jump from sheer excitement. Ever feel so excited that 
you just want to leap around?&nbsp; Excitement produces physical energy and 
this energy has to go somewhere. Jumping and licking can also be sign of 
submission. The dog has to jump up in order to lick the owner&rsquo;s face. 
Licking the face and around the mouth is a learned behaviour in our dogs and 
particularly prevalent in wolves, our dogs&rsquo; ancestors. Licking around the 
mother&rsquo;s mouth stimulates her to regurgitate food. It also shows mum that 
pups are submissive towards her. Many pups and adult dogs will lick faces of 
humans and other dogs after being reprimanded. Licking is an appeasement 
gesture &ndash; sorry mum.</p> 
<p>On the other side of the coin &ndash; some dogs will jump because they feel 
uneasy when someone comes into the house. Jumping becomes a controlling/coping 
mechanism that allows the dog to deal with the new intrusion. Taking this to 
the extreme is the dog that jumps up, puts his front paws on a person&rsquo;s 
shoulders and stares them full in the face. I&rsquo;ve met a few of those dogs 
and that is a direct challenge that I am not willing to win at that moment. I 
shall win the battle in a much gentler but clever way throughout training.</p> 
<p>So what can you do if your dog jumps on people when they come through the 
door?</p> 
<ol> 
<li>If your dog is jumping from pure excitement then it is wise to manage your 
environment by not allowing the dog to greet people when they first come 
through the door. Keep your dog behind a baby gate and don&rsquo;t allow him to 
greet until he is calm.</li> 
<li>It is important to be consistent. Don&rsquo;t allow the dog to jump up on 
you when greeting and expect him not to jump up on guests when they come into 
the house.&nbsp; Mixed messages are confusing and unfair.</li> 
<li>The best way to stop a dog from jumping up is to ignore it while it is 
jumping. This is an easy but effective way to deal with the problem. Each time 
the dog jumps up at you &ndash; turn your back. Don&rsquo;t look, talk or touch 
the dog at any time it is trying to jump. Fold your arms in front and be 
boring. When he stops jumping wait for four seconds of four paws on the floor 
then reward this with your attention in a calm manner. If your dog jumps again, 
repeat. Sometimes the dog jumps harder and higher to get your attention. This 
is known as an extinction burst.&nbsp; What has worked before is no longer 
getting attention so the dog tries harder. Be consistent because eventually he 
will give up! Remember ignore the crazy and reward the calm.</li> 
<li>If your dog is unconfident around guests and jumps to be controlling, do 
not allow your dog to greet your guests. Put him in a place where he can be 
calm and confident. When guests are seated allow your dog to come in and say 
hello. If your dog is aggressive in any way to strangers it is your primary 
responsibility to keep your guests safe. If this means your dog is away while 
guests are in your home, so be it. You will have a happier dog and happier 
guests.</li> 
<li>When your dog can greet in a calmer manner, teach him to walk up to a 
person and sit in front of them rather than jump all over them. This exercise 
will give your dog something to do while greeting providing a more controlled 
energy outlet which you and your guests will appreciate!</li> </ol>

<h3>Hound Houdinis needed!</h3> Posted by Victoria Stilwell - 06/12/08 at

<h3>Just back from Crufts</h3> Posted by Victoria Stilwell - 05/19/08 at 
10:05:53 am -4 Comments<br>

<p></p> 
<p>I have just returned from Crufts &ndash; the dog show of all dog shows. 
&nbsp;Every year I go it seems to get bigger and better.&nbsp; There are more 
things for the average dog owner to enjoy such as agility, flyball, training 
classes, heel to music demonstrations and trade stands by the hundreds.&nbsp; 
You could spend all day at Crufts and not see one dog being shown.&nbsp; I love 
the buzz, the energy and the passion.&nbsp; Dog owners from all over the world 
unite for four days of pure heaven.&nbsp; But for a few of the dogs that are 
being shown, I&rsquo;m not so sure that is the case.</p> 
<p>I make no secret of the fact that I come from a rescue-oriented background 
and have never been a part of the show-dog world, but that&rsquo;s not to say 
I&rsquo;m completely against it, either.&nbsp; If the dog enjoys the attention, 
the hustle and bustle, the grooming and the travel, then I have no problem with 
it.&nbsp; But I see some dogs at Crufts and other dog shows that look 
completely miserable, and if we are to be honest, showing that type of dog is 
not really for the dog at all.&nbsp; If you asked those dogs what they would 
prefer to be doing, running outside chasing rabbits would be my guess, rather 
than spending most of the day in a crate, prancing around a room and having to 
stand still for long periods being felt up by a person they don&rsquo;t 
know.&nbsp; No, showing holds no benefits for that type of dog at all; it is 
purely for the owner.</p> 
<p>I have an issue with the word &lsquo;conformation,&rsquo; which in dog show 
terms means &quot;overall appearance and structure &ndash; an indication of the 
dog&rsquo;s ability to produce quality puppies&quot; (American Kennel Club). 
&nbsp;Dogs are judged on appearance and form, the winner being the closest to 
conformation.&nbsp; The judge examines the dog and then &quot;gives awards on 
how closely the dog compares to the judge&rsquo;s mental image of the perfect 
dog described in the breed&rsquo;s official standard.&quot;&nbsp; I think the 
dog world needs to take a closer look at the concept of breed 
conformation.&nbsp; Celebrating and perpetuating a strict set of rules 
constituting breed conformation means that many breeds of dogs live with 
disabling physical characteristics and hereditary diseases that can cause acute 
suffering and in some cases premature death.&nbsp;&nbsp; Many of our beautiful 
breeds are being bred to destruction such as the Great Dane, the German 
Shepherd and the Cavalier King Charles, but no breed is more maligned or 
disfigured than the English &lsquo;British&rsquo; Bulldog.</p> 
<p>I recall an argument I recently had with a breeder of English bulldogs who 
took great affront at my concerns about the breed.&nbsp; She accused me of 
wanting to ban them &ndash; her immediate reaction to questions I asked her 
that she knew she couldn&rsquo;t defend.&nbsp; For example, do you think it is 
right that 80% of bulldogs cannot be whelped naturally because the 
puppies&rsquo; head are too big?&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you think it cruel that 
these dogs find physical exercise difficult because their legs are so crooked 
that their joints tire easily?&nbsp; How unkind is it that these dogs have been 
bred to have such short noses that they suffer from brachycephalic upper airway 
syndrome &ndash; difficulty breathing particularly during exercise and in hot 
weather?&nbsp; Isn&rsquo;t it uncomfortable to have so many folds on the face 
that fold dermatitis and other infections can occur if not cleaned daily?&nbsp; 
The breeder told me that facial folds were important because they helped drain 
the blood away from a bulldog&rsquo;s face when it was bull baiting. &nbsp;I 
didn&rsquo;t know we still practiced that in this country!&nbsp; I then showed 
her a print of what a bulldog used to look like in the 1800&rsquo;s, a proud, 
fit, long-legged dog that looked like it could take on a whole empire, not just 
one raging bull.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m not condoning the vicious sport of bull 
baiting, long since banned (thank goodness), but our English bulldogs these 
days couldn&rsquo;t take on a fly let alone a bull.&nbsp; How can breeders 
ignore the suffering of their dogs all in the name of conformation? &nbsp;Why 
do those championing breed conformation continue to celebrate this 
breed&rsquo;s discomfort and deformity?&nbsp;</p> 
<p>And it&rsquo;s not just the Bulldog.&nbsp; Approximately 500 genetic health 
defects have been documented in dogs and defects are very high in purebreds 
because the gene pool is so limited.&nbsp; There are currently standards in 
place which require that offspring come from the mating of registered dogs with 
the same lineage.&nbsp; Breeding dogs from the same champion will pass on the 
good and the bad genes, and breeding dogs that are too closely related, which 
is common practice, means there is more of a chance that defective genes will 
come together.&nbsp; There are some breeders who are working hard to breed out 
defective genes, but many will breed so much to conformity in the hope there 
will be champion stock, that healthy dogs are rejected in favour of ones that 
meet breed conformation standards regardless of health.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>There are also many breeders that will defend their breeding practices by 
saying that &lsquo;line breeding&rsquo;, i.e. breeding grandparent to 
grandchild, cousin to cousin, uncle to niece etc. is ok as long as you are not 
&lsquo;inbreeding&rsquo; (parent to child, siblings etc.) Geneticists 
disagree.&nbsp; Line breeding is still classed as inbreeding and it weakens the 
gene pool considerably.&nbsp; How can we as a dog loving nation allow this to 
continue? &nbsp;It seems to me that thinking about the dog&rsquo;s 
well&ndash;being comes second to breed conformation.&nbsp; Breeders will seek 
to defend this notion, but unfortunately they can&rsquo;t argue what is staring 
them full in the face, &lsquo;in the long term, without the introduction of new 
and unrelated genes, all living creatures will suffer loss of genetic 
diversity, leading to weaker animals with health problems.&rsquo;&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The situation is now so serious that scientists are predicting that in the 
future many breeds will become extinct.&nbsp; The evidence is there and 
it&rsquo;s happening now.&nbsp; Which breeds?&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll leave you with 
one that has already made it onto the list of endangered breeds.&nbsp; The 
beloved flat coated Retriever.&nbsp; Shocked?&nbsp; That is just the tip of the 
iceberg!</p> <br>

<h3>A War in the Neighborhood</h3> Posted by Victoria Stilwell - 03/12/08 at

<p></p> 
<p>A war is about to start in my neighborhood, the same war that is being 
fought in neighborhoods around the world. There is a public footpath across the 
road from where I live. This path is used by runners, mothers pushing prams, 
children on their bicycles and people walking their dogs. My daughter and I 
walk along the path to get to the playground in the local park. But getting to 
the park has become a hazard because if we don&rsquo;t walk with our eyes 
concentrated on the ground, chances are we will step in dog poo. It is 
everywhere and I&rsquo;m sick of it. Yes, it&rsquo;s against the law to not 
pick up after your dog and yes, if you&rsquo;re caught you could be fined a 
nominal sum, but no-one is watching, so owners continue to flout the law and 
leave their dog&rsquo;s mess for everyone to step in. Well not anymore, because 
I&rsquo;m on a mission to clean up the neighborhood and it starts now.</p> 
<p>Allowing a dog to foul a public area and not clearing up after it poses a 
serious health risk to humans and other dogs. Diseases can be passed through a 
dog&rsquo;s intestinal tract and into the feces. These diseases can cause 
debilitating illnesses in dogs and humans and in some cases can be fatal.<br>
 
Here are just a few of them:</p> 
<ul> 
<li><strong>Adenovirus</strong> &ndash; a viral disease in dogs that can 
damage the liver and kidneys. Can cause convulsions, jaundice, bleeding from 
orifices and even death.</li> 
<li><strong>Parvovirus</strong> &ndash; a viral disease causing vomiting, 
diarrhea, immunosuppression and in many cases can be fatal. This disease is 
particularly dangerous in puppies.</li> 
<li><strong>Giardia</strong> &ndash; a parasite that infects the 
gastrointestinal tract and causes diarrhea</li> 
<li><strong>Coccida</strong> &ndash; a parasite that causes diarrhea</li> 
<li><strong>Tapeworm, Whipworm, Hookworm</strong> &ndash; worms that live off 
the intestinal tract causing illness such as vomiting diarrhea and anemia.</li> 
<li><strong>Toxicariaosis</strong> - can cause blindness, particularly in 
children who come into contact with an infected stool while playing and 
inadvertently putting their fingers in their mouths.</li> 
<li><strong>E-coli</strong> &ndash; can cause urinary tract infections in 
humans, meningitis, peritonitis, mastitis, septicemia, pneumonia, severe 
vomiting and diarrhea and in few cases even death.</li> </ul> 
<p>Fortunately modern-day vaccinations can protect your dog from some of these 
diseases but for others there is no protection.</p> 
<p>So what is to be done? First I will write to the local authorities. We need 
more notices, bins and bag dispensaries to make picking up poo more palatable. 
If this doesn&rsquo;t happen I will have to put up my own signs &ndash; they 
just might not be so diplomatic. If that fails I might have to keep watch with 
my video camera ready to pounce on any offender. Seriously taking action is 
only half the battle as some dog owners need a big kick up the backside. It 
just remains to say, for all of those who pick up their dog&rsquo;s poo &ndash; 
thanks and blessings. For those who don&rsquo;t &ndash; shame on you. Be warned 
&ndash; next time I might be watching.</p> <br>

<h3>A New Arrival</h3> Posted by Victoria Stilwell - 03/05/08 at 10:03:53 am -

<p></p> 
<p>I&rsquo;m very happy to announce that we have a new addition to our family. 
She is overweight, snores at night and has some pungent gas problems but we 
love her and she&rsquo;s here to stay. Sadie the chocolate Labrador came into 
our lives at the beginning of February. She is five years old with the most 
appealing eyes you have ever seen and the kindest nature. Sadie belonged to an 
elderly lady who was no longer able to keep her due to illness and members of 
the family decided that it would be best to re-home her. She had spent the best 
part of three years with virtually no exercise and has become very overweight. 
Their neighbour, who happens to be a good trainer friend of mine, took her in 
and knowing that we were looking to adopt a dog, called us with what she 
thought was the ideal candidate. As soon as Sadie stepped through the front 
door we knew she was the dog for us. My daughter Alexandra is scared of dogs, 
possibly from the fact that she has watched mummy training the naughty puppies 
on TV and in her mind, every dog is a &lsquo;naughty puppy.&rsquo; I was a 
little concerned what Alex&rsquo;s reaction would be to a very large brown dog 
but I needn&rsquo;t have worried. Sadie walked up to my daughter, sat down in 
front of her and raised her paw as if to shake hands and say hello. To this day 
the pair are inseparable.</p> 
<p>I have providing counselling to many families about the process of getting 
a new dog, particularly important when there are small children involved. It 
seems strange that after being dogless for so long because of work commitments, 
I am now in the same position. I can&rsquo;t take any chances with a four year 
old running around and need to have a dog that is particularly good with 
children. Sadie has to be one of the most gentle dogs I&rsquo;ve ever seen with 
a child, but I still believe that there has to be effective management so that 
Alex and Sadie are never left alone together. It is also important that I talk 
to Alex about what she is and what she is not allowed to do around the dog. 
Fortunately she&rsquo;s a trainer&rsquo;s daughter and at the age of two and a 
half was already training her toy Dalmatians to &lsquo;leave it&rsquo; and 
&lsquo;sit&rsquo; with pretend treats and a training pouch I had given her. The 
amazing thing was, I had never taught her to do these things &ndash; she was 
copying what she had seen me do on the television, with dare I say it exactly 
the same tone of voice! Always be aware parents that even if you don&rsquo;t 
think they are, your children are watching and listening to everything you say 
and do. Alex understands how she should behave around Sadie but needs a gentle 
reminder from time to time.</p> 
<p>As I write this Sadie is lying beside me wondering when this new woman is 
going to take her for a walk. The sun is shining through the window onto her 
beautiful chocolate coat and I am transfixed. I have never had a dog of my own 
even when I was a child. I have fostered countless here in the USA but have 
never been able to bond with them because I knew they were going to go to new 
homes. Now, after so long, this beautiful animal lying next to me is truly 
mine. Welcome Sadie to our home and our family &ndash; we are so blessed that 
you are now part of our lives.</p> <br>
