<h2>Dogs &amp; Cats Can Live Together</h2> Written by Alana Stevenson |  | <br>
<h3></h3> 
<p>It can take time for dogs and cats who have never met to acclimate to each 
other, but many dogs and cats can coexist peacefully and happily together, and 
great friendships can develop between them. Some dogs are very gentle with 
kitties and actually prefer the company of cats to that of other dogs. Some 
dogs need training to be around kitties. Other dogs need strict management.</p> 
<p>Unfortunately, when people introduce dogs to cats, the usual scenario is 
that the dog chases the cat, and the cat ends up hiding in the basement or 
closet or under the bed. This is unnecessary and not fair to either animal 
&mdash; especially your kitty. Your cat should not be relegated to the basement 
or bedroom. Below are some helpful guidelines and suggestions to follow to 
introduce a dog and cat to each other.</p> 
<p><em>If you have a dog who is shy, fearful, or timid and a kitty who is 
territorial, confident, or aggressive, reverse some of these suggestions. 
Interrupt and prevent your kitty from being aggressive to your dog, and reward 
your dog for showing calm, confident behavior around your cat. Reward your cat 
for being friendly to your dog or for ignoring him. Cats love kindness and 
positive reinforcement and are very amenable to behavior modification too.</em>
</p> 
<h3>Helpful Guidelines &amp; Suggestions</h3> 
<p>* Designate a room or location in the house that is entirely your 
cat&rsquo;s territory. Teach your dog that he is not allowed in this area.</p> 
<p>Your dog should not have access to litter boxes or to your cat&rsquo;s 
food. In addition, your cat should not have to pass or dodge your dog to get to 
food and water bowls or litter pans.</p> 
<p>* Make sure your kitty has extra territory and places to go to feel safe 
and to get away from your dog. Invest in a few good cat trees or cat condos. 
These add vertical territory for your cat and will make your kitty feel safer 
around your dog.</p> 
<p>* Be sure to give your kitty plenty of attention</p> 
<h3>Scent is Important to Animals</h3> 
<p>* If you frequently wear a perfume, cologne, or lotion, rub it on your 
skin. When it dries, pet your animals. This way you can create a 
&ldquo;communal&rdquo; odor. Scent is very important to animals. If your dog 
and kitty smell similar to you and to each other, they may bond more quickly.
</p> 
<p>* Let your dog and cat get used to each other&rsquo;s smells through a 
closed door. Reward your dog for showing calm behavior. Treat and feed your 
kitty when your dog is nearby. When your dog is calm and mild-mannered around 
your cat, your cat will be relaxed around your dog.</p> 
<h3>Starting from a Good Place</h3> 
<p>* Exercise your dog before introducing him to your cat. If your dog has 
just run a few miles or played ball in the park for an hour, he will be calmer, 
less energetic, and more relaxed around your cat. Do not introduce your dog to 
your cat if your dog has not had any exercise.</p> 
<p>* Feed your cat and dog at the same time so they can see each other. If 
your cat is afraid of your dog, feed them in separate rooms. This establishes a 
positive association between them and gives them a reason to like each other.
</p> 
<p>* Always place your kitty on higher surfaces than your dog. This protects 
your cat and makes him feel more confident. If your kitty is less likely to 
run, your dog will be less likely to chase.</p> 
<p>* Introduce your cat to your dog when your dog is tired, resting, or 
sleeping. While your dog is sleeping or resting, feed your cat treats on the 
cat condo or sofa, or pet and brush your kitty on your lap. Do not bring your 
cat over to your dog or force or push an interaction.</p> 
<h3>Rewards &amp; Positive Reinforcement</h3> 
<p>* Reward your dog for ignoring your cat, and if possible, for lying down 
and relaxing. This is a good time to provide your dog with a chew toy, treat 
ball, or other food-dispensing toy. If your dog cannot relax, teach your dog to 
back away, or temporarily remove your dog from the room. Then allow your dog 
back into the room and reward him for being calm, friendly and relaxed, and for 
ignoring your cat.</p> 
<p>* Teach your dog polite manners. Train your dog using positive 
reinforcement when your cat is in the room. This will teach your dog how to 
behave and to listen to you when your cat is present.</p> 
<p>* Use a front-clip body harness or head halter when introducing your dog to 
your cat, and make sure to have your dog on a leash. This will give you more 
control. It will prevent your dog from chasing your cat and will allow you to 
reward him for behaving gently around your kitty. Keep the leash relaxed and 
practice good leash skills. Reward your dog any time he looks away from your 
cat.</p> 
<p>* Give your dog and cat reasons to like each other. Feed them extra-good 
food and treats when they see each other. Prevent any negative interactions or 
altercations from occurring, and manage the environment so that your dog can be 
rewarded for showing friendly, nonthreatening behaviors.</p> 
<p>* Play with your dog quietly when your kitty is in the room. If your dog 
does not chase or pursue your cat, he should be given a fantastic reward.</p> 
<h3>Restraints &amp; Banishment</h3> 
<p>* Prevent your dog from chasing your cat by immediately interrupting your 
dog and redirecting him to a more appropriate behavior, such as coming to you, 
chewing on a toy, or lying down.</p> 
<p>* If your dog barks at your cat, remove him from the room. Bring him back 
in and reward him for being calm, friendly, and gentle, or for ignoring your 
cat.</p> 
<p>* When you are not there to supervise, your dog and cat should be separated 
until you know they will behave well with each other.</p> 
<p>* If your dog still cannot be trusted around your cat after you have 
followed the above suggestions, seek the help of a qualified humane dog trainer 
or animal behaviorist. Your dog may need to be fully managed or supervised 
around your kitty, or completely separated from your cat.</p>
