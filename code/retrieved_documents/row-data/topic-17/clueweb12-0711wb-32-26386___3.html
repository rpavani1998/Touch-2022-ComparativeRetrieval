<strong>Description:
</strong><br>
 If you look closely at that little cat face, she has quite a 
winsome expression and the dog looks like a friendly sort as well. Very 
harmonious given the stereotype cartoon view of dogs constantly chasing after 
cats at every opportunity.<br>
<br>
 If you prefer silver over gold for 
accessorizing, I have the name plate itself available in stainless steel 
(silver tone). If you prefer the more traditional gold tone (brass) name plate, 
I also give you that choice.<br>
<br>
 By far, my customers have chosen the 
magnetic backing over the pin backing. The pin backs are just not as long 
lasting, plus they put holes in your scrubs, jacket or shirt. I have customers 
with name badges from the Magic Zoo that are over 4 years old and the magnetic 
back is still in fine shape. That's my 2 cents worth of advice on the topic!<br>
<br> I think this expressive pewter dog cat combination name tag would also 
make a wonderful gift for your favorite veterinary professional whether that is 
a veterinarian, veterinary technician, practice manager or assistant. (I know 
there are a lot more job descriptions around an animal hospital or clinic but 
you get the idea- everyone would likely enjoy an animal name badge.)  &nbsp; 
Lots of one animal name badges have personality, but the adorable pewter kitty 
tooth fairy name tag&nbsp;is really something! <br>
