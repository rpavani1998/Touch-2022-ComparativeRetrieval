<p> The cat is obviously smarter. I trained my dogs. My cats, on the other 
hand, trained ME. </p>

<p> The cat. They manage to get folks to go to great lengths to try and win 
their affection, while remaining aloof and sometimes downright contemptous of 
them. I like cats...but I like dogs better. ;-) </p>

<p> I've never seen a cat lead a blind person, or a aid a deaf person, or 
watch a police cat in action, or witness a cat play catch with a frisbee or 
fetch a stick. Have you ever seen a cat swim after a ball? I'll say a dog I've 
only seen cats sit around the house and lick themselves. </p>

<p>One of my cats plays fetch - cats can be trained - they just need the right 
reward - dogs will do anything for any kind of reward.</p>

<br>
 CAT DIARY<br>
<br>
 Day 983 of my captivity.<br>
 My captors continue to taunt 
me with bizarre little dangling objects.<br>
 They dine lavishly on fresh meat, 
while the other inmates and I are fed hash or some sort of dry nuggets. 
Although I make my contempt for the rations perfectly clear, I nevertheless 
must eat something in order to keep up my strength. The only thing that keeps 
me going is my dream of escape.<br>
<br>
 In an attempt to disgust them, I once 
again vomit on the carpet.<br>
<br>
 Today I decapitated a mouse and dropped 
its headless body at their feet. I had hoped this would strike fear into their 
hearts, since it clearly demonstrates what I am capable of. However, they 
merely made condescending comments about what a &lsquo;good little 
hunter&rsquo; I am. Bastards!<br>
<br>
 There was some sort of assembly of 
their accomplices tonight. I was placed in solitary confinement for the 
duration of the event. However, I could hear the noises and smell the food. I 
overheard that my confinement was due to the power of &lsquo;allergies.&rsquo; 
I must learn what this means, and how to use it to my advantage.<br>
<br>
 
Today I was almost successful in an attempt to assassinate one of my tormentors 
by weaving around his feet as he was walking. I must try this again tomorrow 
&mdash; but at the top of the stairs.<br>
<br>
 I am convinced that the other 
prisoners here are flunkies and snitches.<br>
<br>
 The dog receives special 
privileges. He is regularly released - and seems to be more than willing to 
return. He is obviously retarded. </p>

<p> The dog, I know many people will say cats because of how they act but the 
last I read, dogs were more popular, so if the cat was smart, they might act 
more like dogs. :) </p>

<p> The cat.<br>
<br>
 Cats are more cautious and curious about their world. 
Dogs are just more obiediant and loyal than cats. But ive witnessed both 
species do dumb things. </p>

<p>revised answer-- but very true. I do not consider the cat or the dog dumb.
<br> Considering -them both at a higher level in my mind---dogs are more 
needy-yes ---cats love to explore--nothing wrong with that.They make mistakes 
-yes---so do we....think about it---???</p>

<p> Apparently cats have better problem solving ability. They are also far too 
intelligent to think the world revolves around their person. They are quite 
well aware THEY are the centre of their universe. They dont have an owner. they 
have staff.They are way too intelligent to perform tricks to entertain us.<br>
 
Intelligence is a quality that is difficult to define in actuality.<br>
 
Cleverer people than me have problems deciding how to measure and define it.

<p> I think it depends on the cat and dog. Overall, I think cats are a little 
bit smarter...I would say that perhaps &quot;smarter&quot; is not the word to 
describe them, but CUNNING! oh gosh, they can be sneaky little creatures! But 
most dogs are just loyal, needy, cute little things. I love dogs, they are such 
great companions.<br>
<br>
 Actually, I've seen a cat that acted like a dog 
before..that was so cute! She came over, sniffed my hand, licked my hand, and 
'stood up' like dogs do to get the person to pet them...it was so funny. :) </p>

<p> Dogs eat rat so I would say a dog!<br>
 On the other hand a cat is 
nobody's fool.<br>
<br>
 I like both and the intelligence of cats and dogs 
varies with different tasks.<br>
<br>
 But......dogs don't eat rat so I'd 
choose a dog. </p>

<p> The cat, in my opinion, is smarter in general. Yeah, you will have some 
dogs that are smarter then cats and vise versa. That's life. But look at 
general things. It's in the dogs breed to be taught tricks, that does not make 
them smarter. Just more easier to train. Just because you can't teach a dog to 
sit with a stupid hot dog over a week and it maybe takes two weeks to teach a 
cat, that doesn't mean cats are dumb. They're just stubborn. I think cats just 
don't care enough. A cat can reason, choose for it's self. A dog does what it 
is told or acts as if in a pack. Dogs are social. So what! Cats can be stuck 
out in the wild and survive. Stray cats, hunting. Stray dogs, starving and 
getting ran over. Also, scientific studies show that the cat brain structure is 
similar to a humans.<br>
 Cats win my vote. </p> 
<h6>Comments</h6> 
<ul> 
<li> 
<p>Sorry but that stray argument is bull****. Ive seen way more dead cats on 
the side of the road than dogs. And both species have survived this long in the 
world so both have very good survival instincts. Also, interdependence and 
being social is a trait that most humans have so if you want to argue who acts 
more like humans, dogs would win.</p>

<p> That depends on how you define smart. Some say dogs are smarter because 
they can be trained, others say cats are smarter because they refuse to be 
humiliated and dogs are too stupid to know better than to be our clowns. But 
I've known a lot of cats that were clowns too. I reall don't believe that one 
is smarter than the other. They are different, and I think they're both cool 
animals. </p>

<p> Dogs have been described as little men in fur coats.<br>
 Cats have been 
described as little women in fur coats, therefore my answer is cats. :o) </p>

<p> The cat I have now is smarter than any dogs I have owned. I think it's 
individual and that cats are just more independent than dogs are. </p>

<p> From all the research that can be done, it has been determined that cats 
and dogs are of equal intelligence levels. Each has their own advantages but 
overall they are the same. Just because a dog is much more trainable than a cat 
does not mean he/she is smarter. Also however, just because a cat is ignorant 
and too lazy to learn tricks does most DEFINITELY not mean he/she is smarter. 
Ignorance is not a sign of intelligence (for all you people who think that). 
Overall they are the same &quot;smartness&quot;. There are no tests at this 
moment in time that can clearly tell which animal is smarter.<br>
<br>
 If i 
had to give an answer, it would be dogs because the only thing ive seen cats do 
is sit there and lick themselves, follow laser pointers and shiny things, climb 
up trees and not be able to get down (at least most of them) and get hit by 
cars after they escape from themselves and most likely cannot find their way 
back. </p>

<p> To me dogs are smarter,they are able to learn stuff cats can never do...if 
well trained you can rely on it,but you can never rely on cat..cats do the job 
to keep my dog kennels free of any rats or mouse... </p>

<p> Cats.For one reason,you can teach one to light a fuse in only 2 
seconds.He's a small cynic.On the other hand, it takes just about a dog's whole 
life to learn how to breathe!Cats read Harry Potter and blow bubble pipes.Dogs 
watch Spongebob and suck on lolipops.Your death would grant a cat's fondest 
wish.He hates you. </p>

<p> A cat can remember a maze 260 times longer than a dog...however, dogs do 
better on &quot;social skills&quot; than cats, although some cats (Main 
Coon,Ragdoll, persians for example) are extremely sociable, and some dogs (many 
chows, for example), aren't. I think that to compare them is a waste of time 
because first you have to give a definition of &quot;smart&quot; and 
&quot;smart&quot; is different for each animal...and why compare dogs and cats? 
It's silly--no one compares dogs or cats to horses! </p>

<p> I find this question funny as the answer will never be known. I love all 
animals and have both a cat and a dog. I do however have my own opinion that 
works for my reasoning. How can somebody say a dog isn't that smart because it 
will only listen to commands and act based on reward, are they not doing 
exactly what humans do when they were trained/taught for society. A human is 
trained through repetative teachings and rewarded for it in every aspect of 
life from the first time you went to the bathroom in the toilet or learned your 
muliplication tables to learning a new skill set at your job...reward, reward, 
reward! &quot;A dog can't find food and will get run over by a car&quot;, are 
you F'ing serious to use that comment as your proof? I've seen many dead cats 
on the side of the road and i've also seen an entire street shut down because 
an intelligent cat climbed a tree and couldn't get down without the aid of a 
&quot;trained&quot; fireperson. In my opinion and only mine, i do think dogs 
are smarter because they fit the criteria that i use when judging an animals 
mentality. </p>

once. And in my opinion dogs are smarter.... </p>

<p> The Cat. They are more independent and less easily confused than most dogs 
I know. All of the dogs I know would be completely helpless without thier 
owners. </p>

<p> Almost all dogs will eat cat crap from a litter box, but I've never heard 
of a cat eating dog crap.<br>
 I would think that's an indicator </p>
