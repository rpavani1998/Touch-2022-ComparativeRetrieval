<p><i>The following article originally appeared on&nbsp;PETA Prime.</i></p> 
<p>Each of us could easily recite the myriad reasons that our animal 
companions hold such a special place in our hearts. A common argument levied 
against animal activists suggests that we prefer animals to people. Rhetorical 
questions such as, &quot;If you could only save a baby or a dog from a burning 
building, who would you choose?&quot; come to mind. These types of questions 
serve to obscure the real issue: that our societal treatment of animals is in 
dire need of improvement.</p> 
<p>Fortunately, having to choose between &quot;the baby or the dog&quot; 
seldom occurs in real life. But maybe there is more than a sliver of truth to 
the argument, as evidenced by the responses to a blog,&nbsp;&quot;Cat vs. 
Spouse.&quot;&nbsp;I suspect that if I had to choose between spending the next 
year on an island with either 10 random humans or an equal number of dogs and 
cats, I'd be looking for dog and cat food. It would be my version of Survivor!
</p> 
<p>On some level, I find this a sad reflection on the nature of my 
relationships with humans, and I acknowledge that I'm simply more comfortable 
around animals than I am around people. People have on numerous occasions 
caused me to feel disappointment and betrayal. I can seldom recall feeling let 
down in a similar manner by an animal. Maybe we simply expect more from people 
than we do from animals. I don't expect a birthday card each year from my dog, 
Winston, and I don't recall Lilly, my cat, saying &quot;Thank you&quot; for her 
new toy. Are our impressions of animals misplaced because our expectations of 
them are simply not as great? I suggest quite the opposite.</p> 
<p>I believe that animals are devoid of all of the malevolence that people 
inflict on each other. In my view, animals are never deceitful, dishonest, 
manipulative, or malicious unless they are severely provoked or are in the 
wild, where Darwinian influences matter. OK, Winston may try to convince me 
that I forgot to feed him, but that doesn't count. Animals are often able to 
forgive humans for unspeakable treatment. I can't imagine that animals would 
ever take up hunting humans simply to entertain themselves, yet&nbsp;hunting 
remains a popular &quot;sport&quot; among humans.</p> 
<p>I recall feeling livid years ago after seeing one of Eddie Murphy's&nbsp;
<em>Dr. Doolittle</em>movies. I realized it was because he imbued all the 
animal characters with the aforementioned odious human qualities, which he 
apparently thought that we would find humorous. His characterization of animals 
behaving more like people violated my lofty beliefs. It revealed an ugly world 
similar to the one James Stewart saw in&nbsp;<em>It's a Wonderful Life</em>
&nbsp;had he never been born.</p> 
<p>In conferring animals with the best of intentions, I take a leap of faith. 
Although I don't use the word &quot;faith&quot; often, perhaps my feelings 
regarding the inherent goodness of the spirit of animals are akin to the faith 
that others may have in a deity or higher power. I believe this knowing that my 
theory can never be disproved. My trust in animals softens the harshness and 
disappointment that my interactions with humans occasionally bring. It is my 
hope in my daily work as an animal doctor that I honor that trust and express 
my gratitude to them for their enrichment of the world in which those of us 
blessed to know animals live.</p> 
<p>&quot;I am in favor of animal rights as well as human rights. That is the 
way of a whole human being.&quot;<br>
&mdash;Abraham Lincoln</p>

 I love this 
article. Its well written and gets across her thoughts wonderfully. I agree 
wholeheartedly. They say people are evolving and becoming smarter and more 
efficient, but it seems with all of the technology and new advancements, people 
are also becoming more neglectful and heartless. They are forgetting about what 
life is all about: respecting all living things. Whether it be in a place that 
kills animals for food, or a home where an animal is invited to live. All 
animals deserve respect, unfortunately I am starting to feel that not all 
humans deserve respect. </li>

 I don't know who I'd 
choose I love animals and especially &quot;my&quot; companion animals. However, 
I'd need someone to talk to. I think I'd choose the ten dogs. I'd probably be 
healthier than with humans and not havve to hear the ten people complain about 
being on an island. </li>

 Most often, I find 
animals easier to be around than people (with the exception of my family). The 
biggest difference to me is that animals exude a &quot;what can I do for 
you?&quot; when most humans have &quot;what can you do for me?&quot; Animals 
love to please and show unconditional love - sadly, this is not something we 
would use to describe society today. </li> </ul>  Submit a Comment
