<h1>Are you a cat or dog person?</h1> <br>

<p>Ask anyone whether they prefer cats or dogs and why they feel that way and 
you are likely to elicit a strong response. The more common replies you might 
encounter are:<em>'Cats are standoffish and aloof</em>', '<em>Dogs are stupid
</em>', '<em>Cats are more independent</em>', <em>'Dogs protect you</em>'. The 
list goes on and on.</p> 
<p>If the figures from the Pet Food Manufacturers Association are anything to 
go by, the UK is a divided nation with the dog population standing at 7.3 
million and the cat population at 7.2 million in 2008.</p> 
<p>However, when we look at it logically, there are a number of reasons people 
might choose one species over the other:</p> 
<ul> 
<li><strong>History</strong><br>
 Some people have grown up around either cats 
or dogs and they base their preferences on their experience. Some have always 
had cats or dogs and it's what they are comfortable with and understand. On the 
other hand, some people may have had a bad experience &ndash; perhaps they were 
scratched by a cat or bitten by a dog.</li> 
<li><strong>Practicality</strong><br>
 Some people may want the companionship 
of any pet, but are limited either by space or spare time. Some may choose to 
have cats because they have a small property, whereas others may not have the 
time to walk a dog. On the other hand, those that do have the time and space 
may opt for dogs.</li> 
<li><strong>Children</strong><br>
 Some people may think it's not practical to 
have a dog around a very small child and that a cat could lash out at an 
over-loving child.</li> </ul> 
<p>Elaine Pendlebury, Senior Veterinary Surgeon at the People&rsquo;s 
Dispensary for Sick Animals (PDSA) says:</p> 
<p><em>'In my experience, people either prefer cats or dogs, with a few who 
love both pets equally. However, people's busy lifestyles and their 
geographical surroundings can influence their choice of pet. Dog ownership 
seems higher in rural areas indicating that the many dog-walking opportunities 
available in the countryside might be an influential factor. Equally, our data 
suggests that cats prove quite popular with city dwellers, probably because 
they are far more independent'</em>.</p> 
<h2>Personality traits</h2> 
<p>Of course, these are all practical reasons why people might choose one 
animal over the other, but what is it that makes us prefer cats or dogs. What 
makes us cat or dog people? There is an argument that it is down to what we 
want out of our relationship with them, and in that respect we prefer one to 
the other because of perceived personality traits in terms of human qualities 
that we ascribe to them.</p> 
<p>Cat people will argue that felines are affectionate, more independent, 
cleaner, aren't as demanding and are more self-sufficient. Dog people will 
argue that canines are more loyal, more friendly and playful and more 
demonstrative. It would also be easy to suggest that cat people are more 
relaxed as cats prefer to do their own thing whereas dog people are more 
controlling and like to tell the dog to sit and stay and to keep it on a leash.
</p> 
<p>Whatever the reasons are for people preferring cats or dogs, we may as well 
accept it's just a matter of choice and live happily together! And whichever 
pet you choose make sure you insure it against accidents and illness withDirect
