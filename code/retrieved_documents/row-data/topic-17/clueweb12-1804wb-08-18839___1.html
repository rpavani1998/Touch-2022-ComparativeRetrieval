<p>Do you have a decided preference between cats and dogs? Which do you 
prefer, and why? Would you consider a roommate or partner who had a contrary 
pet proclivity?</p>

Yep! My preference is cats. With my physical 
limitations, a cat is the only way to go. They're independent yet love 
attention, are easy to clean up after (littler box and food dish), and, sorry, 
but they don't have that awful smell that dogs get so easily.<br>

If hubby 
wanted a dog, I'd say ok, especially if it were a lab. Tags: cats, dogs,
