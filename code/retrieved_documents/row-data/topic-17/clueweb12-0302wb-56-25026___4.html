 &gt; Choosing A Cat Bed<br>

<h1>Choosing A Cat Bed</h1>  There are so many different types and styles of 
cat beds that finding one that blends with your d&eacute;cor should not be too 
hard. You can look for colorful cat beds in fun pet prints that add a touch of 
whimsy to the room or you can shop for cat beds with plenty of designer 
elegance, instead. Of course, your cat will be more concerned with how the bed 
feels than what it looks like.<br>
<br>
Cat beds often have fleece pillows to 
keep them feeling cozy. These beds may be oval shaped like the West Paw Oval 
Cat Mats or they may actually be completely enclosed to form a cozy nest bed. 
The Bowser Buttercup Cat Bed , West Paw Bumper Bed or Big Shrimpy Catalina Bed 
are this type of cat bed to name a few. Cats enjoy being able to snuggle up in 
a secure spot, which is why so many of them manage to squeeze inside sofas or 
other odd spots to nap.<br>
<br>
If your cat is committed to the couch, try 
putting down a nap mat. It will keep the cushions clean of cat hair and when 
company comes you can roll it up and put it away. A little cat nip on the mat, 
might keep your cat where you want him.<br>
<br>
When you buy a cat bed, don't 
be surprised if your cat ignores it completely for a while. If he refuses to 
explore the bed, you may want to add a catnip toy to the bed to attract his 
attention. Placing the bed in a cat friendly location will also make it more 
appealing to your cat. Cats do not care to nap in low places. Instead, position 
the cat bed on an end table or platform that is a few inches off the floor. 
Also, be sure the bed is not in an area that receives heavy traffic. If your 
cat feels as though he can never let down his guard and relax, he won't want to 
nap in his bed.<br>
<br>
 Cat perches and dens make perfect napping spots, the 
Kittywalk Cozy Climber or Kittywalk Closet Sleeper are perfect choices.<br>
<br>
Persuading Your Cat to Use Her Bed<br>
<br>
 Not all cats take to using a bed, 
at least not straight away, here are a few tips that may help:<br>
<br>
 
Location, location, location! Try putting the bed where your cat already 
chooses to sleep.<br>
<br>
Try a sunny spot (for daytime naps) or near a 
radiator, when asleep a cat&#146;s body temperature will decrease a little 
which is why they pick a warm spot to snooze.<br>
<br>
Some cats prefer to 
sleep up higher than floor level. If your feline does, try the bed on a 
suitable shelf or stand.<br>
<br>
Place a favorite toy, blanket or cushion in 
the bed to encourage your cat to try it out.<br>
<br>
Remember that praise 
works wonders with cats. Praise and make a fuss of your cat when she starts to 
use her cat bed and the chances are she will keep using it.<br>
<br>
A little 
catnip scattered in or around the bed can be an effective persuader for many 
cats.<br>
