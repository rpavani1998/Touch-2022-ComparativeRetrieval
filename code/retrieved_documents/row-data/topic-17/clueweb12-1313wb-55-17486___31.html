<h2> The Ruff Report: Dogs and Food </h2> <br>
Pricey food may actually be bad

P et parents who feed their dogs and cats those more 
expensive natural, organic and holistic foods that are touted as better may 
find this hard to stomach, but a leading veterinary nutritionist says they are 
no healthier or safer than conventional chow and may even be less nutritious. 
<br><br>
In many instances, these pet foods - which can cost twice as much -

Story 
continues here <br>
<br>
&quot;There is little scientific basis to show that 
natural products are safer, healthier or more nutritious,&quot; Dr. Dzanis said 
during a presentation titled &quot;Pet food myths and fallacies&quot; at the 
annual conference of the American Veterinary Medical Association. &quot;In 
fact, some have questioned the ability for natural preservatives to prevent 
product degradation as effectively as the synthetic, which if true, could lead 
to spoilage, loss of nutritive value and potential adverse effects.&quot; <br>

<br> Natural pet food <br>
<br>
Many pet owners mistakenly assume that natural 
pet products contain better ingredients and are safer than conventional pet 
foods, but in many cases they basically contain the same ingredients at a much 
higher price, Dr. Dzanis states. <br>
<br>
Under Association of American Feed 
Control Officials guidelines, a natural product must contain no chemically 
synthetic ingredients, according to Dr. Dzanis. However, many natural pet foods 
do contain some synthetic trace nutrients like vitamins, minerals and taurine 
(a heart supplement) to formulate a complete and balanced product. Makers of 
natural pet food can do this because the AAFCO allows use of a disclaimer such 
as &quot;natural with added vitamins and minerals&quot; to qualify the addition 
of synthetic nutrients. <br>
<br>
&quot;Thus, the bulk of ingredients in a 
'natural' pet food and a traditionally formulated pet food may be the 
same,&quot; Dr. Dzanis explained. <br>
<br>
By definition, natural pet foods 
cannot have chemically synthetic non-nutritive ingredients - such as artificial 
preservatives, flavors or colors - so natural preservatives - such as mixed 
tocopherols (extracted) or citric acid (fermented) - are used, Dr. Dzanis 
stated. But these natural preservatives can be less effective than chemical 
ones - like synthetic ethoxyquin or propyl gallate - thus the natural food may 
spoil and lose its nutritional value.<br>
<br>
Organic pet food <br>
<br>

Organic foods, which differ from natural, are frequently touted as free of 
pesticides and hormones, given the consumer the impression that they are safer 
for pets, Dr. Dzanis states. <br>
<br>
Organic refers to a system of production 
and manufacturing for ingredients and products. For example, organic grains 
must be grown without genetic engineering or use of synthetic pesticides, 
herbicides or fertilizers. Organic beef must be from cattle allowed daily 
access to outside areas and fed organic feeds with no antibiotics, steroids or 
other drugs. These and other requirements are codified in U.S. Department of 
Agriculture's National Organic Program regulations, according to Dr. Dzanis. 
<br> <br>
&quot;However, these rules are not considered by ( National Organic 
Program ) as a means to ensure safer, healthier or more nutritious foods, Dr. 
Dzanis states. &quot;In fact, there is no regulatory distinction in the 
tolerable levels of pesticides, drugs or other residues allowed in organic 
versus conventional products (even though lower residues may in fact be a 
result).&quot; <br>
<br>
National Organic Program  approval is simply a 
confirmation of the organic production process, Dr. Dzanis states. &quot;The 
purchaser is left to his or her own determination as to whether the costs merit 
the perceived benefits.&quot;<br>
<br>
Holistic pet food <br>
<br>
<br>
No 
rules or definitions exist for a pet product to be labeled holistic, which 
pretty much leaves a consumer on his own to make a determination on whether a 
holistic food's ingredients are any different or better from a conventional pet 
food, according to Dr. Dzanis.<br>

&quot;Notwithstanding its consumer appeal, there

meaning,&quot; Dr. Dzanis states. <br>

Cheap pet food leads to costly 
health problems<br>
<br>
Pet parents tempted to switch to lower-priced food for 
their dogs and cats may save money now, but they are likely to shell out more 
dollars later in extra health costs, a veterinarian says.<br>
<br>

&ldquo;Nutrition is the foundation of good health, and a quality diet can 
actually decrease your pet&rsquo;s chance of developing costly health problems 
in the future,&rdquo; says Karen J. Johnson, a veterinarian atBanfield, The Pet

Higher-quality diets tends to 
have fewer fillers which allows more nutrients to be absorbed by a pet, Dr. 
Johnson states in a media release. Pets also need to eat less of the 
higher-quality food to get the same amount of nutrients in a cheaper brand that 
contains fillers.<br>
<br>
Banfield, The Pet Hospital advises pet parents to: 
<br> 
<ul> 
<li>Use foods that are made by companies known for ongoing nutritional 
research. Make sure the food is fresh by minimizing the time it is stored.</li> 
<li>Feed your pet the right amount according to its weight and avoid feeding 
large amounts at one time.</li> 
<li>Maintain a consistent daily feeding schedule to help your pet keep normal 
elimination habits and avoid indoor accidents.</li> 
<li>Pay close attention to the first three ingredients on a pet food's label. 
The most nutritionally rich foods contain whole ingredients in the top 
ingredients, instead of &ldquo;meals&rdquo; or ground skeletal meats, organs or 
connective tissue. By-product &ldquo;meals&rdquo; do have nutritional benefits, 
but are more beneficial when not among the primary ingredients.<br>

The stinking truth behind 
smelly dog breath <br>
<br>
If  your pet's breath smells bad, take immediate 
action because it is one of the surest signals that your companion is headed 
for life-threatening health problems, a leading veterinary oral care group 
cautions, and a new report about heart ailments and dogs gives much credence to 
the warning.<br>
<br>
Bad breath is caused by gum disease, which three of four 
dogs will develop by middle age. I f left untreated, it will lead to bacteria 
invading the bloodstream and possibly damaging a pet's heart, liver and 
kidneys, according to the Veterinary Oral Health Council.<br>

<br>
And a Perdue University professor's 
findings of a definitive link between gum disease and heart problems in dogs 
underscores the magnitude of the problem.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;We knew from 
previously published research that there was growing evidence of a link between 
gum disease and heart disease, diabetes, birth defects and low birth weight 
among humans,&quot; Larry Glickman, a professor of epidemiology who conducted 
the study, states in a media release. &quot;So we thought it was time to assess 
whether such a link existed in dogs. The research is important because gum 
disease occurs in up to 75 percent of all dogs by middle age.&quot; <br>
<br>

For the study, which was published in the Journal of American Veterinary 
Medical Association, Mr. Glickman examined records of 59,296 dogs with gum 
disease and matched them to those of a similar number of dogs without gum 
problems. He followed the dogs to see which ones developed heart diseases and 
the type. He did statistical tests which showed the incidence of heart disease 
increases with the severity of the gum disease. <br>
<br>
Mr. Glickman says 
isolating the specific bacteria in the mouth that causes the inflammation of 
gums can lead to better treatment and prevention. <br>
<br>
&quot;Knowing the 
mechanism is important, because it'll allow us to develop preventive drugs and 
then examine their effectiveness,&quot; Mr. Glickman said. &quot;We can also 
get pet food companies to develop foods that will prevent gum disease in dogs 
and cats.&quot; <br>
<br>
Preventive care is the best way to stop pets from 
developing periodontal disease and that starts with the brushing of teeth, 
Johnathon Dodd, a clinical associate professor at the Texas A&amp;M College of 
Veterinary Medicine &amp; Biomedical Sciences, states in a media release. 
&quot;Ideally, you should brush your pet&rsquo;s teeth daily,&rdquo; he said.
<br> <br>
But toothpaste used by people cannot be used for pets, Dr. Dodd said. 
&ldquo;Make sure you are using special toothpaste that is made for pets and is 
safe for them to swallow. They cannot spit or rinse like we do, therefore, our 
pets need specific kinds of toothpaste that is not harmful if ingested.&rdquo; 
<br> <br>
Pet toothbrushes and toothpaste, which usually coming in different 
flavors, can be purchased at veterinary offices and pet retail stores. Pets 
also should have their teeth annually cleaned and examined by a professional, 
Dr. Dodd said.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Most veterinary clinics should offer dental 
cleaning services, but if they do not they can refer you to someone who 
does,&rdquo; he said.<br>
<br>
Certain dog treats also promote good dental 
help, Dr. Dodd said. &ldquo;The right kind of treat should crumble, be easily 
crushed, and contain chlorhexadine or a hydrogen peroxide-type additive that 
can help with the bacteria count in the animal&rsquo;s mouth.&quot;<br>
<br>

According to the Veterinary Oral Health Council, periodontal disease - an 
infection resulting from the buildup of dental plaque and tartar on the 
surfaces of the teeth around the gums - is the most common ailment that occurs 
in pets. The bacteria in plaque irritates the gum tissue, which can lead to 
infection in the bone surrounding the teeth.<br>

<p>&ldquo;One of our favorite parts of putting these lists together is talking 
to the pets&rsquo; owners and finding out how they came up with such 
imaginative names,&rdquo; VPI official Curtis Steinhoff states in a press 
release. &ldquo;Strangely enough, a lot of them tell us they ruled out names 
they&rsquo;d be too embarrassed to shout in public when calling their pets back 
to them.</p> 
<p>Rounding out the top 10 unusual dog names are: Sir Seamus McPoop, Audrey 
Shepburn, Dewey Decimell, Knuckles Capone, Beagle Lugosi, Shooter Mclovin and 
Uzi Duzi-Du.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;We found that many [pet owners] had similar strategies for naming 
new furry family members,&rdquo; Steinhoff explained. &ldquo;Nearly every one 
attributed their creativity to an unusual behavior or characteristic that makes 
their pet unique. As you can imagine, there are some interesting stories and 
distinct personalities behind names like Sir Seamus Mcpoop.&rdquo;</p>

Surveys &amp; Studies <br>

<br> Where does your dog's breed rank in popularity? <br>
Many families look 
upon their dogs as superheroes, and apparently that is why many have chosen to 
name their pets after Bella, the fictional heroine character in the vampire 
film &quot;Twilight&quot; and in the series of best-selling fantasy novels that 
the film is based upon, a survey has found.More<br>
<br>
Is your dog's name on

<br>
<b>Who's treated better - your pet or significant other?</b> <b>
<br></b> A survey has found that pets - not people - apparently are the ones

If your dog begins to sniffle, cough and sneeze, get ready 
for some rough days ahead because those are signs that your pet may be coming 
down with the flu.<br>
<br>
Like people, dogs also can be stricken and they

<br>
About 80 percent of the dogs exposed to the 
virus become infected and develop flu-like symptoms, according toCynda 
Crawford, a veterinarian at the University of Florida, who has studied the 
virus since its outbreak in 2004. Dogs lack a preexisting immunity, therefore 
canines of any breed, age or health status are susceptible.<br>
<br>

&quot;Fortunately, most dogs recover within two weeks without any further 
health complications,&quot; Dr. Crawford told Love of Dogs. &quot;However, some 
dogs progress to pneumonia, which is usually due to secondary bacterial 
infections. While the overall mortality rate for canine influenza is low, the 
secondary pneumonia can be life-threatening.&quot;<br>
<br>
Treatment consists 
mainly of supportive care - including administering of antibiotics for 
secondary bacterial infections - while the virus runs its course, much like 
with human influenza, Dr. Crawford said. Dogs with pneumonia are likely to need 
intensive care in a hospital.<br>
<br>
Pet parents who have dogs at high risk 
of contracting canine influenza - like those that spend time in shelters, 
boarding and training facilities, day care centers, dog shows, veterinary 
clinics, pet stores and grooming parlors - should consider getting their pets 
vaccinated, Dr. Crawford said.<br>
<br>
&quot;Although the vaccine may not 
prevent infection, efficacy trials have shown that vaccination significantly 
reduces the severity and duration of clinical illness, including the incidence 
and severity of damage to the lungs,&quot; statesCynda Crawford, a veterinarian 
at the University of Florida.<br>
<br>
&quot;In addition, the vaccine reduces 
the amount of virus shed and shortens the shedding interval,&quot; Dr. Crawford 
said. &quot;This means that vaccinated dogs that become infected have less 
illness and are not as contagious to other dogs. These benefits are similar to 
those provided by influenza vaccines used in other species, including 
humans.&quot;<br>
<br>
According to Dr. Crawford, who has been studying the 
canine virus since its discovery in 2004, canine influenza has been documented 
in 30 states and the District of Columbia. It can occur year-round.<br>
<br>
A 
dog can get the virus by contact with infected dogs or by aerosols generated by 
coughing and sneezing, Dr. Crawford said. The virus can also contaminate kennel 
surfaces, food and water bowls, collars and leashes, and the hands and clothing 
of people who handle infected dogs.<br>
<br>
&quot;Fortunately, the virus is 
easily inactivated by washing hands, clothes and other items with soap and 
water,&quot; she said.<br>
<br>
The vaccine, developed by Intervet/Schering
-Plough Animal Health, recently received approval for use from the U.S. 
Department of Agriculture. It is administered by subcutaneous injection in two 
doses, two to four weeks apart. The vaccine may be given to dogs age six weeks 
or older and can be given annually to ensure more comprehensive protection.<br>

<br>&quot;We developed the vaccine in response to the growing problem of the 
disease,&quot; ChristopherPappas Jr., a veterinarian for Intervet/Schering
-Plough Animal Health, states in a media release. &quot;We are pleased that our 
expertise in respiratory disease and vaccines can help prevent costly outbreaks 
and keep dogs healthier.&quot;<br>
<br>
The American Veterinary Medical 
Association, which in 2006 advocated the necessity of developing such a 
vaccine, lauded the news of the federal government's approval of the vaccine.
<br><br>
&quot;The AVMA is pleased that the USDA has approved the use of a 
vaccine in dogs to help prevent the spread of canine influenza and to help keep 
dogs healthy,&quot; Lynne White-Shim, assistant director in theAVMA Scientific 
Activities Division, told Love of Dogs.<br>
<br>
&quot;Shortly after the 
emergence of canine influenza, some people were not convinced that the disease 
existed and consequently did not believe a vaccine should be developed,&quot; 
Dr. White-Shim explained. &quot;WhenAVMA examined the issue, we learned that 
the disease was sickening racing greyhounds and dogs in some shelters. Thus,AVMA
 has been an advocate for the development of an efficacious vaccine to protect 
those dogs at significant risk.&quot;<br>
<br>
Dr. White-Shim urges dog owners 
to consult with their veterinarians about whether their pet should be 
vaccinated. &quot;As with all vaccinations, the veterinarian and dog owner 
should discuss individual disease risks to determine if the vaccine is 
recommended,&quot; she said.<br>
<br>
The American Society for the Prevention 
of Cruelty to Animals, in conjunction with the Morris Animal Foundation of 
Denver, has launched a study of canine influenza in hopes of better 
understanding the virus and developing treatments.<br>
<br>
&quot;Canine 
influenza is a newly emerging disease that does not discriminate by breed or 
age,&quot; ASPCA veterinarian MirandaSpindel states in a media release. 
&quot;It is critical that we gain a better understanding of the transmission of
CIV in order to limit its effects.&quot;<br>
<br>
In addition to examining the 
spread of the virus among shelter dogs, the study will determine whether a 
rapid &quot;bedside&quot; test can be effectively used for screening dogs upon 
entering a shelter. If such a test were available, dogs could be tested and 
kept separate from the main shelter population and treated to help prevent the 
spread of the virus.<br>
<br>
The study will try to determine how the virus 
changes over time, a process known as &quot;genetic drift.&quot; As with human 
flu viruses, animal influenza viruses constantly evolve. New strains can 
develop that require new vaccines.<br>
<br>
According to the American 
Veterinary Medical Association, dogs and other companion pets also can get flu 
viruses - like the H1N1 virus - from people. So far, four ferrets in Oregon and 
a cat in Iowa have gotten the H1N1 virus a short time after people in their 
households had the illness. No dogs have gotten the H1N1 virus.<br>
<br>
Dr. 
EmilioDeBess, Oregon's public health veterinarian, says pet owners should take 
precautions to help reduce the spread of influenza between themselves and their 
pets.<br>

&quot;Chocolate (baker&rsquo;s, semi-sweet, milk and dark) can be potentially 
poisonous to animals,&quot; ASPCA veterinary toxicologist Steven Hansen states 
in a media release. <br>
<br>
Excessive ingestion of chocolate can cause 
vomiting, diarrhea, increased urination and thirst, abnormal heart rate and 
rhythm as well as hyperactivity and seizures, Dr. Hansen says. <br>
<br>
The 
ASPCA also warns owners to keep dogs away from gum and candy, which often 
contain large amounts of the sweetener Xylitol, which can be a toxic killer for 
pets. Ingestion can cause a sudden drop in blood sugar - resulting in 
depression, loss of coordination, seizures and liver failure. <br>
<br>
Flowers 
should be kept out of reach, too, because they can pose danger for curious pets 
who may ingest them, Dr. Hansen said. &quot;Animals are very good at sniffing 
out things they shouldn&rsquo;t eat,&quot; he said. <br>

<p><strong><b>Here's a better way to feed your pet</b></strong></p> 
<p>You want to keep your pet healthy and free of stomach problems, so you feed 
your dog or cat a premium, natural, organic or fresh food rather than basic pet 
food. You conclude these foods must be better because they are more pricey.</p> 
<p>But, your focus on the pet food itself may be misplaced since 40 percent of 
dogs and cats still suffer from gastrointestinal problems<strong>such as 
stomach upset, vomiting and diarrhea, according to a survey byNestl&eacute; 
Purina. So a better approach to feeding your dog or cat must include monitoring 
your pet's eating habits and lifestyle, a leading a veterinary nutritionist

<p><strong>Many dietary problems can be linked to factors such as feeding at 
irregular intervals, overeating, sudden change in food, munching on too many 
treats and stress, Nestle Purina veterinarian Grace Long says.</strong></p> 
<p><strong> </strong>&quot;Many dogs and cats do not tolerate sudden changes 
in diet.&quot; Dr. Long toldMySetterSam.com. &quot;A sudden change can upset 
the normal population of bacteria that live in the intestine, resulting in an 
imbalance that can lead to diarrhea.&quot;</p> 
<p><strong>Here's what Dr. Long suggests pet parents do to help keep the 
digestive tracts of their dogs and cats healthy:</strong></p> 
<ul> 
<li>Feed and choose a diet from a major food company that conducts extensive 
research and can maintain superior quality control procedures.</li> 
<li>If you have to change your pet's diet, do it gradually over five to 10 
days. Many pets are unable to tolerate a sudden diet change, especially as they 
get older.</li> 
<li>Practice portion control, which is is key to maintaining a healthy weight. 
Feed your pet a specific amount of food twice a day. Adjust that amount if your 
pet is too heavy or too thin.</li> 
<li>Limit treats to no more than 10 percent of the daily calories.</li> 
<li>Give your pet good treats, such as low calorie snacks. Treats are a fact 
of life and to eliminate them is not realistic.</li> 
<li>Avoid people food whenever possible. But if you do give your pet some 
people food, make it healthy foods such as vegetables, small pieces of lean 
meat, cooked eggs and fruit.</li> </ul> 
<p>The survey also found a strong link between gastrointestinal problems and 
lifestyle. Any kind of stress - bad or good - even tends to upset pets.</p> 
<p><strong>Here's what Dr. Long suggests pet parents do to help reduce stress 
for their dogs and cats:</strong><br>
</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Introduce new household pets or visitors gradually.</li> 
<li>Before going a on a long trip, get your pet used to travel by going on 
small trips around town.</li> 
<li>If you are away from home a lot, spend some quality time with your pet 
when you are there.</li> 
<li>If your home is hectic, make sure your pet has a quiet refuge.</li> </ul> 
<p>The <strong>Nestl&eacute; Purina survey found that fewer than one in three 
pet parents fail to seek veterinary help when their dogs and cats are suffering 
from vomiting, diarrhea and gas. Most pet parents ignore the gastrointestinal 
troubles until the condition worsens to loss of appetite. At that point, 49 
percent of dog owners and 60 percent of cat owners consulted with a 
veterinarian.</strong></p> 
<p>But Dr. Long advises pet parents to contact their veterinarian when their 
dogs and cats are having digestive problems and not wait until the condition 
results in loss of appetite. &ldquo;The truth is, veterinarians only hear about 
a fraction of the GI incidents that occur,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;While 
it&rsquo;s understandable that owners may choose to &lsquo;wait out&rsquo; 
certain problems if they appear minor, we also know that even short-lived 
suffering from conditions such as stress diarrhea can be reduced with 
veterinary intervention.&rdquo;</p>

More news about dogs and food</p> 
<p>Seeking veterinary care is also important because gastrointestinal problems 
are sometimes symptoms of a more serious underlying health condition, Dr. Long 
said. &quot;Unfortunately, delaying the veterinary visit when GI issues arise 
often means the veterinarian is dealing with a much more serious condition by 
the time the pet is finally seen.&quot;</p> <br>

&quot;While 
it&rsquo;s easy to think that dogs are immune to cold because of their fur, the 
fact is that more dogs perish in the winter than at any other time of the 
year,&quot; Liam Crowe, CEO of the training company Bark Busters USA, states in 
a media release. &quot;Frostbite, hypothermia and antifreeze poisoning present 
the biggest winter threats to dogs.&quot; <br>
<br>
A dog's paws are especially 
vulnerable to injury during the winter because ice, salt and grit can cause 
fine cracks in the pads and between the toes, according to Four Paws, an animal 
welfare and protection agency in Britain. <br>
<br>
&ldquo;Paw injuries can 
become very painful for the animals,&rdquo; Martina Schnell, a pet expert at 
Four Paws, states in a media release. &ldquo;Dogs often lick their paws clean 
after a walk and salt can reach the stomach where it can lead to stomach 
injuries.&rdquo; <br>
<br>
To protect a pet's feet, Four Paws suggests: 
<ul> 
<li>Applying Vaseline or a protective ointment to paw pads before going out 
for walks to prevent cracks.<br>
</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li>Walking on clear paths as much as possible.</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li>Removing long fur between toes to help prevent ice lumps from forming 
between the paw pads.</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li>Soaking paws in lukewarm water after a walk to remove little stones, salt 
and ice. </li> </ul> Use ointment or disinfectant to cleanse wounds if a dog 
damages its foot pads, Mr. Schnell says. &quot;In order to keep the animal from 
immediately licking off treatments you could give them something to nibble on, 
such as a safe dog treat.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Louise Murray, a veterinarian for the 
American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, says to never leave 
a pet alone in a parked vehicle, because it holds in the cold and can causing a 
pet to freeze to death. &ldquo;On a cold day, a parked automobile can become a 
freezer in no time,&rdquo; Dr. Murray states in a media release. <br>
<br>
Adam 
Goldfarb, director of the pets at risk program of the Humane Society of the 
United States, says pets must depend on their owners to keep them safe from 
serious health risks during winter. <br>
<br>
&quot;Pets are solely dependent 
on their human caregivers for safety and comfort - especially so during the 
winter months,&quot; Mr. Goldfarb states in a media release. &quot;Our pets are 
particularly vulnerable during winter storms and harsh winds..., and a few 
extra precautions can help make sure that they stay safe and healthy.&quot; <br>
<br> Pets should be taken outside for frequent short walks and exercise but 
kept inside the rest of the time, Mr. Goldfarb states. Dogs and cats are social 
animals who crave human companionship, so they will be happy to be indoors with 
their family. <br>
<br>
Mr. Crowe says many dogs spend less time outside in 
winter because of bitter cold and snow, so owners should plan to do more inside 
activities to help their companions from getting lethargic or hyper. <br>
<br>

The best way to keep a dog active or to use his excess energy is to make him 
think, according to Mr. Crowe. Providing 10 to 15 minutes of training once or 
twice daily on basics such as sit, stay, come and walking on leash will 
energize a lethargic dog and cause the hyper dog to be more tired. <br>
<br>

Bark Busters offers these winter safety tips: 
<ul> 
<li>Keep dogs inside when the temperature falls below 20 degrees; puppies, 
smaller dogs and older dogs should not be left outdoors when the temperature 
falls below 40 degrees.<br>
</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li>Put a sweater on a short-haired dog when he goes outside, because he can 
become immediately chilled after leaving a warm house.<br>
</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li>Older, arthritic dogs inside should not be left outside under any 
circumstances. Use a leash to escort older dogs outside for toileting to avoid 
falls and injuries.</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li>Wipe your dog&rsquo;s feet after a walk in the snow to remove ice and salt 
deposits from the road. Salt irritates a dog&rsquo;s paws and can be toxic if 
ingested. Use only pet-safe ice melt.</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li>Watch for signs of frostbite and injury, especially on susceptible areas 
like ears, paws and tails. Initially, frostbitten tissue may appear pale or 
gray, and the area will be cold and hard to the touch. As the area thaws, it 
may become red and within days the tissue will start to appear black. If you 
suspect frostbite, bring your dog into a warm location and soak the affected 
area in lukewarm water for about 20 minutes and contact a veterinarian.<br>

</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li>Watch for sign of hypothermia, which include shivering, lethargy, low 
heart rate and unresponsiveness. If you suspect hypothermia, bring the dog into 
a warm area, place a light blanket over him and call a veterinarian.<br>
</li> 
</ul> 
<ul> 
<li>Make certain that all antifreeze containers are locked away and out of 
reach of dogs, and thoroughly clean any spills immediately. Dogs like the sweet 
taste of antifreeze, which can cause sickness or death if ingested.<br>
</li> 
</ul> 
<ul> 
<li>Keep dogs inside during a snowstorm, because a dog can lose its ability to 
scent and can go astray. A loose dog can also fall through ice or get hit by a 
vehicle, especially since icy roads make it harder for cars to stop.<br>
</li> 
</ul> 
<ul> 
<li>Make certain that your companion's doghouse meets certain minimum criteria 
if he stays outside. A doghouse needs to be raised a couple of inches off the 
frozen ground or concrete; needs cedar shavings or straw, which should be 
changed frequently to keep a dog warm and dry; and needs a flap on the door. Do 
not use blankets, which get wet from snow and will chill your dog.<br>
</li> 
</ul> 
<ul> 
<li>Use a plastic water bowl so a dog&rsquo;s tongue does not get stuck to 
cold metal.<br>
</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li>Alter the amount of food your dog gets depending on activity level. An 
active dog will burn more calories in the cold and needs about 10 percent more 
food. A less active, indoor dog needs less food.<br>

Toxic levels of chemical found 
in dog foods <br>
<br>
T oxic amounts of a fluoride have been found in several 
major brands of dog food, possibly putting pets at a higher risk of cancer, 
neurotoxicity and other life-threatening illnesses, a research organization 
warns. <br>
<br>
The dog foods contain fluoride levels 2.5 times higher than 
the Environmental Protection Agency's national drinking water standard and 
those excessive levels &quot;can predispose dogs to health problems, along with 
high veterinary bills, later in life,&quot; according to the Environmental 
Working Group. <br>

<br>
&quot;Due to a 
failed regulatory system and suspect practices by some in the pet food 
industry, countless dogs may be ingesting excessive fluoride that could put 
them at risk,&quot; Olga Naidenko, lead researcher of the Environmental Working 
Group-sponsored study, states in a media release. <br>
<br>
Scientists have yet 
to determine how much fluoride is safe for dogs, but they have found people who 
consume excessive fluoride often develop mottled teeth (dental fluorosis) and 
weakened bones, leading to more fractures. High fluoride consumption is also 
associated with reproductive and developmental system damage, neurotoxicity, 
hormonal disruption, and bone cancer. <br>
<br>
Three studies show that boys 
ages 6 to 8 who drink fluoridated tap water face a heightened risk of 
osteosarcoma, the rare but deadly form of bone cancer associated with fluoride. 
Scientists suspect that boys' rapid growth may make them more susceptible to 
bone cancer. <br>
<br>
Dogs may be even more vulnerable to osteosarcoma than 
humans, according to EWG. More than 8,000 osteosarcoma cases occur in dogs each 
year in the United States, nearly 10 times the number that occur in people, 
according to the study. <br>
<br>
&quot;Whatever the size and the appetite of a 
dog, combined fluoride exposure from food and water can easily range into 
unsafe territory,&quot; the study states. &quot;And, unlike children, who enjoy 
a variety of foods as they grow up, puppies and adult dogs eat the same food 
from the same bag every day, constantly consuming more fluoride than is healthy 
for normal growth.&quot; <br>
<br>
In the study, 10 brands of dog food were 
tested. Two dog food brands, one with vegetarian ingredients and one made by a 
small manufacturer, had no detectable levels of fluoride. But eight others - 
all major brands - found to contain high levels of fluoride. The contents of 
those brands included chicken byproduct meal, poultry byproduct meal, chicken 
meal, beef and bone meal. Any ingredient described as &quot;animal meal&quot; 
is basically ground bones, cooked with steam, dried, and mashed to make a cheap 
dog food filler.<br>
<br>
The Washington-based Environmental Working Group, 
whose stated purpose is to protect human health and the environment, advises 
pet parents to feed food to their dogs that contains no bone meal and other 
meat byproducts to minimize exposure to harmful pollutants, including fluoride. 
&quot;To protect pets from excessive fluoride exposures, dog owners can 
purchase pet foods that do not contain bone meal and other animal 
byproducts,&quot; the study states. <br>
<br>
Pet food should be held to the 
same health and safety standards as human food and should be free of 
contaminants that may endanger pets' health, the study states. Yet, the federal 
Food and Drug Administration has little authority and few resources to ensure 
that products produced for pets are safe. The fact so many popular national pet 
food brands contain previously undetected health hazards shows that better 
federal food safety regulations are needed.<br>

all members of American households, whether they walk on two legs or four.&quot;

<p>The activity that 83 percent of pet parents do that is putting their dog in 
harm's way is driving without their properly restraining their companion.</p> 
<p>An estimated 30,000 car accidents occur each year because people travel 
with unrestrained dogs, according to Bark Buckle Up, an organization that 
promotes the use of safety belts for pets.</p> 
<p>&quot;Safety belts can only work if you use them ... Like people, pets need 
to buckle up when in the car - but that takes the owner's help,&quot; Christina 
Selter, the organization's founder states in a media release.</p> 
<p>An unrestrained dog involved in an accident is at great risk of injury or 
death, and it can also be a threat to others, Ms. Selter explained. &quot;In a 
35 mile-per-hour accident, a 60-pound dog becomes a 2,700-pound 
projectile.&quot;</p> 
<p>An unrestrained dog involved in an accident is likely to get hurt, be 
frightened and attempt to flee, which can result in danger to the pet and 
others such as first responders and rescue workers, Ms. Selter said. &quot;Most 
accidents injure the pet. Unrestrained, they can bite the first responder on a 
scene or cause a second accident when fleeing an accident.&quot;</p> 
<p>A rambunctious, unrestrained pet also can to distract the driver, making an 
accident more likely, safety officials say, yet most people drive with their 
dogs unrestrained. According to a survey by AAA and Kurgo, a maker of pet 
travel products, only 17 percent use any form of pet restraint system when 
driving with their dog.</p> 
<p>Other findings of the AAA/Kurgo survey include:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>80 percent of dog owners say they take their pet along on leisure trips, 
to do errands and to places like the pet store, dog parks and to work.</li> 
<li>31 percent admit to being distracted by their dog while driving.</li> 
<li>59 percent say they have been involved in distracting activities with 
their dog while driving.</li> 
<li>55 percent have patted their dog while driving.</li> 
<li>21 percent have allowed their dog to sit in their lap.</li> 
<li>7 percent give food and water to their dog while driving.</li> 
<li>5 percent play with their dog while driving.</li> </ul> 
<p> These behaviors can distract the driver and increase the risk of a crash, 
AAA says. The AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety found that looking away from 
the road for only two seconds doubles your risk of being in a crash.</p> 
<p>Of the 17 percent of drivers who restraint their pets, the survey found: 52 
percent use a pet harness/safety belt; 28 percent use a hard-sided pet travel 
crate; 18 percent use a pet vehicle seat; 13 percent use a soft-sided pet 
travel crate; 9 percent use a vehicle pet barrier.</p> 
<p>The survey found that most drivers - 54 percent - put their dogs in the 
back seat during trips . Other locations in the vehicle include: front seat, 26 
percent; rear cargo area, 17 percent; pickup truck bed, 2 percent.</p> 
<p>AAA warns that the airbag system in a vehicle can be deadly to a dog during 
a crash if it is sitting in the front seat, even if restrained.</p> 
<p>Dogs USA magazine advises pet parents to restrain their dogs in the back 
seat when driving. Pet parents have several options to help reduce the risk of 
injuries to their dogs when traveling, including the use of travel crates and 
pet harnesses. Crates should be large enough for a dog to stand up and change 
position, and secured in the vehicle&rsquo;s back seat.</p> <br>

<br>
So the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty 
to Animals and the American Kennel Club are urging owners to adopt this simple 
New Year's resolution: Spend more time and do more activities with your pet.<br>
<br> &quot;Eighty-one percent of dog owners buy gifts for their dogs,&quot; AKC 
spokeswoman Lisa Peterson states in a media release. &quot;But what you should 
really be giving them is consistent exercise, training and stimulation. Try to 
start the year off right by resolving to do more with your dog.&quot; <br>
<br>

Dogs who spend more time with their owners are usually happier and better 
behaved, according to animal experts.<br>
<br>
The AKC offers these suggestions:
<br> 
<ul> 
<li>Train your dog for competitive events. Every weekend throughout the United 
States dog events are taking place where pets can earn ribbons, titles and 
trophies. Competitive events help ensure that your dog is well-behaved, even 
tempered, physically fit and a joy to live with. And owners get to meet new 
people with a similar love for dogs.<br>
</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li>Put your dog into service. Dogs love helping others. They are invaluable 
in providing service to humans - visiting the sick, helping the disabled and 
locating missing persons. If a dog has the correct temperament, there are many 
ways dog owners can put their special skills to use in service to their 
community. Contact the volunteer director at your local hospital to find out 
how you and your dog can qualify to volunteer or visit a home-bound neighbor.
<br></li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li>Let your dog help teach children to read. There is no better listener than 
a dog. Many libraries have programs for children to practice their reading 
skills and gain confidence by reading with dogs. Contact your local library to 
learn about available reading programs or volunteer to start one with your dog.
<br></li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li>Travel with your dog. Planning vacations and getaways that include your 
dog will save you boarding fees and will keep your pet from getting lonely 
while you are having fun in the sun. More hotels are becoming dog friendly.<br>

</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li>Get fit with your dog. The National Academy of Sciences reports that one 
of every four dogs and cats in the Western World is overweight. Daily walks are 
a great way for dogs and owners to avoid gaining extra holiday pounds. 
According to a recent study, dog owners get more exercise walking their pet 
than someone with a gym membership.<br>
</li> </ul> The ASPCA offers these 
suggestions for New Year's resolutions: <br>

<ul> 
<li>Visit your veterinarian. If it has been a year or more since your pet has 
seen a veterinarian, make an appointment now. This will give your veterinarian 
the chance to notice any developing illnesses and attend to them right away.<br>
</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li>Pledge to check your pet's teeth and gums at least once a week. Your cat 
or dog may need dental care if it has morning breath all day. Ask your vet to 
show you how you can prevent dental disease by brushing regularly.<br>
</li> 
</ul>

<h2> The Ruff Report: Dogs and Safety </h2> <br>
Your pet deserves this 
priceless holiday gift<br>
<br>
T he best present you can give your pet during 
the holiday season is so large that it cannot fit in a box, needs no fancy 
ribbon, costs absolutely nothing and can be delivered only by you. <br>
<br>

You should consider giving your dog or cat the precious gift of safety, because 
the holiday period is one of the more dangerous - and poisonous - times of the 
year for pets, according to animal welfare advocates.<br>
<br>

A Story that will Touch Your Heart <br>
<br>
THE HUNT 
OF HER LIFE,  a full-color book  by newspaper journalist and  MySetterSam.com  
publisher Joseph A. Reppucci,  makes a great gift for animal lovers of all 
ages. It has 60 color photos of dogs to illustrate the compelling story of 
Samantha, an unwanted rescue dog adopted at age 2 by Mr. Reppucci. Travel with 
them along a trail of life filled with surprising twists, sudden turns, mystery 
and even what some call a miracle. And when the journey is finished, you may 
never look at people and their pets, motherhood - and perhaps even God - in the 
same way. THE HUNT OF HER LIFE will take you on a captivating journey - a trip 
like no other - that will touch your heart. <br>

<br>
Pets 
face an assortment of hazards: some hidden, like the strings used to tie the 
turkey during roasting that can get entangle a pet's intestines if ingested, 
and others not-so-hidden, like chocolate which is toxic and can kill in even 
small amounts. <br>
<br>
&ldquo;Many of the winter traditions we enjoy can be 
harmful to our companion animals,&rdquo; Dr. Steven Hansen, a board-certified 
veterinary toxicologist and senior vice president of the American Society for 
the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, states in a media release. &ldquo;When 
preparing for this festive season, be mindful of activities that can be 
potentially hazardous to pets.&rdquo; <br>
<br>
Pets are at a higher risk of 
being poisoned because toxins are everywhere during the holiday season with 
people medications, food and plants accounting for most pet poisonings, animal 
welfare advocates say. <br>
<br>
People medications <br>
<br>
The number of 
pets being poisoned from human medications increases during the holiday season, 
because people have tendency to become careless, animal welfare officials say. 
<br> <br>
&quot;All prescription and non-prescription drugs should be safely 
stored,&quot; Dr. Hansen said. <br>
<br>
But many people keep their medications 
in daily pill reminders, in their luggage or even leave it out when staying 
with family or friends, making them easy targets for pets, Dr. Hansen said. 
&quot;Even in small doses, human medications can be potentially lethal to 
pets.&quot; <br>
<br>
Food <br>
<br>
Many foods, especially chocolate and other 
candies, are toxic to pets, animal welfare advocates say.<br>
<br>

&ldquo;Depending on the dose ingested, chocolate (bakers, semi sweet, milk and 
dark) is potentially poisonous to many animals,&rdquo; Dr. Hansen said. 
&ldquo;Vomiting, diarrhea, tremors, hyperactivity and increased thirst, 
urination and heart rate can be seen with the ingestion of as little as 
one-quarter ounce of baking chocolate by a 10-pound dog.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Other 
highly toxic food are macadamia nuts, which can cause temporary weakness in 
back legs, and any food containing Xylitol, a sugar substitute that can make a 
dog's blood sugar drop quickly and cause liver damage.<br>
<br>
Wayne Ingmire, 
a veterinarian at Mokena Animal Clinic near Chicago, says people should avoid 
giving their dogs and cats people food because pets who get table scraps are 
likely to get sick. <br>
<br>
&ldquo;Providing rich human foods is just a bad 
idea, and it can cause pancreatitis and general internal illness, Dr. Ingmire 
states in a media release from the North American Pet Health Insurance 
Association. &quot;Pancreatitis is an inflammation of the pancreas, and it can 
be life threatening. When a pet is diagnosed as having pancreatitis, he/she 
becomes more susceptible to developing it again so you want to avoid your pet 
ever having it.&quot; <br>
<br>
Pets who get sick after eating people food 
usually need veterinary treatment, Dr. Ingmire said. &quot;If your pet becomes 
ill with bloody vomit and diarrhea after consuming turkey or ham or getting 
into the garbage, take your pet to your veterinarian immediately.&rdquo;<br>

<br> Leon Robbins, a veterinarian at Grandview Animal Hospital near 
Winston-Salem, North Carolina, says the best way to avoid digestive problems is 
to give a pet its normal diet.<br>
<br>
&quot;If there is food left over, don't 
give it to your pet as a holiday treat,&quot; Dr. Robbins states in a media 
release from Pet Sitters International of King, North Carolina. &quot;Instead 
give baby carrots, green beans or broccoli as treats.&quot; <br>
<br>
Holiday 
decorations <br>
<br>
Holiday trees and decorations also can pose dangers for 
pets, Dr. Robbins explained, because they are attracted to bright lights, 
shining ornaments and dangling tinsel and ribbons, which can damage a pet's 
intestines if ingested. &quot;Try to use big, pet-friendly ornaments and keep 
the ornaments, as well as the lights, out of a pet's reach,&quot; he said.<br>

<br> Animal welfare advocates urge people to consider decorating trees with 
ornaments that are less enticing to dogs and cats. <br>
<br>
Water for holiday 
trees also can pose a health hazard, animal welfare experts say. Dogs and cats 
may try to drink tree water, which can harbor bacteria, so use pet-friendly 
preservatives in it rather than chemical fertilizers. Tree stands designed to 
prevent pets from accessing the water also are an option. <br>
<br>
Holiday dos 
and don'ts <br>
<br>
The following information comes from the ASPCA, North 
American Pet Health Insurance Association and Pet Sitters International. Foods 
that pose danger to pets include:<br>

<ul> 
<li>Rich, fatty foods like turkey skins or gravy, which can cause stomach 
upset, diarrhea or pancreatitis</li> 
<li>Bones, which can tear or obstruct a pet's intestinal tract. Poultry bones 
can be especially dangerous or even fatal to animals.</li> 
<li>Onions, which are are toxic and can destroy a dog's red blood cells, 
leading to anemia. Also avoid foods containing high amounts of onion powder.
</li> 
<li>Grapes and raisins, which contain toxins that can cause kidney failure.
</li> 
<li>Chocolate, especially baking chocolate, which can kill a dog. It affects 
the nervous system and causes urinary system and heart muscle damage.</li> 
<li>Coffee, which is dangerous, so watch out for grounds and whole beans.</li> 
<li>Nicotine, which is a stimulant that can increase the heart rate leading to 
collapse and death.</li> 
<li>Alcohol, avocado, macadamia nuts, yeast dough are also dangerous. </li> 
</ul>  Other holiday safety and poison concerns for pets include: <br>

<ul> 
<li>Lilies, which can cause kidney failure in cats if ingested.</li> 
<li>Mistletoe, holly berries and poinsettias, which are toxic to pets if 
ingested.</li> 
<li>Anti-freeze and ice-melting chemical, which are toxic to pets in ingested.
</li> 
<li>Candles/open flames, which a pet may accidentally knock over and start a 
fire.</li> 
<li>Aluminum foil and cellophane, which can damage a pets intestinal track if 
ingested.</li> 
<li>Electrical cords, which a pet can trip over and get injured or chew on and 
get a shock.</li> 
<li>Batteries, which can cause ulceration to a pet's mouth, tongue or 
gastrointestinal tract if bitten or swallowed. </li> </ul>

<h2> The Ruff Report: Dogs and Safety </h2> <br>
Don't be in the dark about 
this pet threat<br>
<br>
A natural phenomenon that happens each year puts your 
pet at a much higher risk of injury or even death, and dogs and cats need 
careful guidance to deal with it, an animal welfare agency warns.<br>
<br>
This 
marvel of Mother Nature that endangers the well-being of pets occurs in late 
autumn and winter, the period when daylight becomes scarce, nights are longer 
and the chances of your pet being hit by a vehicle skyrocket. <br>

<br>
During this period, road traffic accidents involving 
pets spike 8 percent, resulting in more broken bones, fractures and deaths, 
according to PDSA, a leading veterinary charity in Britain. <br>
<br>

&quot;It's essential to keep your dog on a lead when out walking and, as much 
as possible, only walk them in daylight,&quot; Elaine Pendlebury, a 
veterinarian for PDSA, states in a media release. <br>
<br>
The injuries that 
occur from road traffic accidents during winter are also far more severe - or 
even fatal - than at other times of the year, Dr. Pendlebury said. Pets 
frequently get hit by vehicles moving at higher speeds because drivers brake 
late since they are unable to see a pet dashing into the road until the last 
moment. <br>
<br>
&quot;During the winter, victims of road traffic accidents 
are one of the most common causes of trauma we see at PDSA PetAid 
hospitals,&quot; Dr. Pendlebury said. <br>
<br>
Young cats, like those age 7 
months to 2 years, are particularly vulnerable because they often lack 
&quot;street-wise&quot; abilities. <br>
<br>
Because of the darkness, pet 
owners many times fail to realize their dog or cat has been hit by a vehicle, 
Dr. Pendlebury said. &quot;Often injuries are hidden or impossible to detect 
without a veterinary inspection; such as bruises buried beneath layers of fur 
or internal injuries.&quot; <br>
<br>
According to PDSA, indications that a pet 
has been involved in road traffic accident include: Pale gums and lips, which 
could be a sign of internal bleeding; difficulty breathing; cuts, wounds and 
bruises; scuffed hind claws which could indicate a dug its claws into the road 
when hit; and limping or inability to stand.<br>

<p> </p> Oral care is one of the most neglected areas in dog and cat health, 
and pet advocates are urging owners to make it part of their companion's 
regular health maintenance. <br>
<br>
&quot;Many pet owners don't place as much 
emphasis on dental health as compared to other aspects of their pet's well 
being,&quot; Brent Hinton, chief executive officer of PetFirst insurance, 
states in a media release. &quot;It's just as important, though, because oral 
disease can lead to serious health problems for both dogs and cats.&quot; <br>

<br>According to the American Veterinary Dental Society, 80 percent of dogs and 
70 percent of cats show signs of oral disease by age 3. <br>
<br>
Without 
proper care, plaque and tartar buildup can lead to periodontal disease, which 
affects the tissues and structures supporting the teeth. Left untreated, it can 
cause oral pain, dysfunction, tooth loss and damage the heart, liver and 
kidneys. <br>
<br>
Symptoms of periodontal disease include yellow and brown 
tartar buildup along the gum line, inflamed gums and persistent bad breath. 
Common signs of oral disease include bad breath, a change in eating habits, 
pawing at the mouth and depression. <br>
<br>
Hinton said the best preventative 
plan is to schedule regular teeth cleanings for pets and for pet owners to work 
with veterinarians to establish a dental-care regimen at home.<br>

<p>Another insurer, Veterinary Pet Insurance, reports in a media release that 
itspolicyholders spent more than $4.6 million in 2010 on dental conditions, the 
10th most common type of claim submitted to the company in 2010. Claims 
received for preventive teeth cleaning care, on the other hand, only totaled 
$1.9 million.</p> 
<p>In 2010, the average claim amount made at VPI for pet teeth cleaning was 
$180. In contrast, the average claim amount for treating tooth-related 
conditions was $233. Periodontal disease, a condition that results when a 
bacterial infection grows under the gum, accounted for the most dental claims 
received by VPI in 2010 &mdash; nearly 17,000. Abscesses were the second most 
common tooth-related claim. Tooth abscesses are typically the result of 
untreated tooth decay, cracked teeth, or severe periodontal disease. VPI 
received nearly 2,700 abscess claims in 2010 with an average claim amount of 
$220.<br>
</p> <br>
VPI has teamed with Iams dog food to launch the web site 
http://www.healthyteethforpets.com/ to provide advice about proper oral care 
for pets. <br>
<br>
In a media release, Petland of Wesley Chapel, Florida, 
advises pet parents to regularly clean their companions' teeth. Actions owners 
can take to help with good dental health include: <br>

<ul> 
<li>Routinely inspecting your pet's teeth for signs of decay and oral disease. 
Bad breath, discoloration and tartar are all indications of a problem.- 
Brushing your pet's teeth daily or at least weekly. Toothpaste made for people 
must not be used for pets. A veterinarian can recommend proper pet-safe 
toothpaste.</li> 
<li>Feeding your pet crunchy food. The abrasive texture of hard food can help 
keep teeth clean, while soft food can cling to a pet's teeth and lead to decay. 
Also consider crunchy treats, which help clean pet&rsquo;s teeth.</li> </ul>

and take remedial action before the behavior escalates into biting.More<br>
<br>
A fun place for dogs where fighting often erupts<br>
The neighborhood dog park 
- or play area - is the perfect setting for skirmishes to suddenly erupt 
between normally well-mannered pets, a behavioral expert warns. More<br>
<br>

Dogs feel no guilt about misbehaving<br>
That &quot;guilty look&quot; your dog 
displays when you admonish him for misbehaving is not really remorse after all, 
because dogs are incapable of feeling sorry, a study has found. Your pet's 
demeanor is merely a reaction from the tone of the language you use.More<br>

<br>Hey dummy, your dog's smarter than you think<br>
The average dog can count, 
understand 165 words, solve complex problems, and a dog's intelligence level is 
on par with a 2-year-old child, according to Stanley Coren, a psychologist and 
professor at the University of British Columbia.More<br>
<br>
Help your pet 
cope with back-to-school stress<br>

bowls, toys<br>
An environmental research organization says testing has found

household item causes most pet poisonings<br>

Prevention of Cruelty to Animals says most poisonings involve prescription and 
over-the-counter drugs. Pets often snatch pill vials from counters and 
nightstands or gobble up medications dropped on the floor.More<br>
<br>

<br> <br>
Living room item a leading cause of pet injuries<br>
Many pets like 
to jump on and off the household furniture. But - believe it or not - that 
seemingly harmless activity is one of the top causes for pets to break bones, 
and pet parents are urged to take preventive measures. More<br>
<br>
Most

<p>&ldquo;Traveling can be highly stressful, both for you and your animal 
companions,&quot; ASPCA executive vice president Stephen Zawistowski states in 
a media release. &quot;With thoughtful preparation, you can ensure a safe and 
comfortable trip for everyone.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Using products designed for pet travel - such as car safety seats and 
harnesses, anti-spill travel bowls, first aid kits and car travel ID tags - can 
make the trip much more comfortable for pets and their owners, Dr. Zawistowski 
says.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;The increase in products specifically geared for pet travel and 
safety has made the experience that much easier for pet parents,&rdquo; Dr. 
Zawistowski said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all the more reason families should take 
precautions to ensure that their pet&rsquo;s travel is trouble-free.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>A visit to the veterinarian prior to the trip is a must, according to the 
ASPCA, to ensure a pet is up-to-date on vaccinations and to obtain flea/tick 
prevention and heart-worm medications. Pet parents should get a health 
certificate dated within 10 days of air travel and ask about any particular 
parasites or health risks that might be associated with the planned destination.
</p> 
<p>Air Travel<br>
</p> 
<p>Here are some tips from the ASPCA for air travel with a pet:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Your pet should always wear a collar and identification tag with an 
address or cell phone number where you can be reached. Additionally, you should 
display a current photograph on your pet&rsquo;s carrier and write the name, 
address, and telephone number of the person receiving the animal at your 
destination.</li> 
<li>Purchase a USDA-approved shipping crate. It should be large enough for 
your pet to comfortably stand, sit and turn around in. Write &ldquo;Live 
Animal&rdquo; in large letters on at least two sides of the crate, and use 
arrows to indicate the upright position of the crate. Make sure the door is 
securely closed, but not locked, so airline personnel can open it in an 
emergency.</li> 
<li>Book a direct flight if possible to decrease your pet&rsquo;s chances of 
being left on a tarmac or outside during extreme weather conditions. Tell every 
airline employee you encounter, on the ground and in the air, that you are 
traveling with a pet in the cargo hold. This way, they will be ready if any 
additional considerations or attention is needed.</li> </ul> 
<p>Automobile travel<br>
</p> 
<p>Here are some tips from the ASPCA for automobile travel with a pet:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Keep your pet in a well-ventilated crate or carrier. Make sure it is large 
enough for your pet to stand, sit, lie down and turn around in.</li> 
<li>Outfit your dog with a harness and safety belt if your pet is riding in a 
seat. This will keep you pet secure in case of sudden stops or changes in 
direction.</li> 
<li>Don't allow your pet to ride with his head outside the window. He could be 
injured by flying objects.</li> 
<li>Cats should always be in a carrier.</li> 
<li>Never leave your pet alone in a parked vehicle. On a hot day, even with 
the windows open, a parked automobile can become a furnace in minutes, 
resulting in heatstroke for your pet. In cold weather, a car can act as a 
refrigerator, holding in the cold and causing the animal to freeze to death.
</li> 
<li>Bring bottled water or tap water from your home stored in plastic jugs for 
your pet. Drinking different water can cause your pet to get an upset stomach.
</li> 
<li>Bring your pet&rsquo;s rabies vaccination records. Some states require 
this proof at interstate crossings.</li> 
<li>Make sure your pet has an ID collar with your home address and a temporary 
travel tag with your cell phone, destination phone number and any other 
relevant contact information.</li> </ul>

<h2> The Ruff Report: Dogs and Food </h2> <br>
<br>
This common artificial 
sweetener is killing dogs <br>
<br>
A common artificial sweetener found in 
sugar-free baked goods, candy, oral hygiene products and chewing gum can be a 
killer if ingested by a dog, the FDA is warning. 
<p>Xylitol, which is only intended for use by people, can cause sudden drop in 
blood sugar (hypoglycemia), seizures and liver failure if ingested by dogs, the 
Food and Drug Administration says. Depression, loss of coordination and 
vomiting are signs that a pet may have ingested the artificial sweetener, and 
symptoms may occur within minutes to days of it.</p> Story continues below<br>

<p>Owners should consult a veterinarian or pet poison control center 
immediately for advice if they know or suspect that their pet has ingested a 
product containingxylitol, the FDA advises.</p> 
<p>Dr. Eric Dunayer, a veterinarian at the American Society for the Prevention 
of Cruelty to Animals, says dogs who eat larger amounts of items sweetened with
xylitol are especially at risk of death. &quot;These signs can develop quite 
rapidly, at times less than 30 minutes after ingestion of the product,&rdquo; 
he states in a media release. &ldquo;Therefore, it is crucial that pet owners 
seek veterinary treatment immediately.&quot; </p> 
<p>Dr. Dunayer, who specializes in toxicology at the ASPCA's Animal Poison 
Control Center, says even small amounts ofxylitol can be harmful to dogs, and 
they may not show signs of illness for as long as 12 hours after ingestion. 
&ldquo;Our concern used to be mainly with products that containxylitol as one 
of the first ingredients,&quot; he states. &quot;However, we have begun to see 
problems developing from ingestion of products with lesser amounts of this 
sweetener.&quot;</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>In 2009, the ASPCA Animal Poison Control Center in Urbana, Ill., managed 
2,690 cases of accidental xylitol ingestion. This is a nearly 40 percent 
increase in the number of cases involving xylitol-containing products from just 
three years ago, and 30 times as many cases from 2004, when the center managed 
less than 100 incidents of xylitol ingestion.</p> 
<p>&quot;One explanation as to the increase in the number of pets accidentally 
exposed to xylitol may simply be an increase in availability,&quot; Mindy 
Bough, vice president of the ASPCA Animal Poison Control Center, states in a 
media release. &quot;Xylitol seems to be becoming more popular in food products 
because it is a useful sugar substitute for diabetics and has been shown to 
decrease the development of cavities in humans.&quot;</p>

about dogs and food</p> 
<p>According to the ASPCA, other artificial sweeteners made for human 
consumption can also make pets ill. Sweeteners such assucralose (Splenda), 
aspartame (NutraSweet) and saccharin (Sweet N' Low) can cause gastrointestinal 
upset if eaten in significant quantities, so it is still a good idea to refrain 
from offering pets foods contained these sweeteners.<br>
