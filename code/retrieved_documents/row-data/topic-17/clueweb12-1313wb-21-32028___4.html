<p><b>What Do Geese and Stray Dogs Have in Common?</b></p> 
<p>Answer: They&rsquo;re both getting a little more protection thanks to 
HRC&rsquo;s Grassroots Research Fund. Read below to see how andplease make a 
tax-free donation to the fund today!</p> 
<p>Small animal organizations have the same needs as larger groups, including 
access to research to improve their messages and programs. But most small 
groups don&rsquo;t have the funds for research, which is why HRC created our 
Grassroots Research Fund.</p> &nbsp; 
<p>We provide free research services to two small animal organizations each 
year, more if we have the funds (donate now!). We just completed the first 
project with the Animal Rights Coalition (ARC) in Minneapolis, which showed 
that diners in the Twin Cities overwhelmingly oppose force-feeding geese and 
ducks to produce foie gras. ARC is already using this research to save animals.
</p> 
<p>We are also very excited to announce the latest recipient: CANDi &ndash; 
Cats and Dogs International, which works with the travel industry to reduce 
animal suffering in tourist destinations. See below for more about these 
organizations and pro bono projects.</p> &nbsp; 
<p><b>HRC needs your help to work with more small animal groups in 2012! To be 
able to help another small group this year, we need to raise at least $2,300 
for the Grassroots Research Fund by July 1st. Can you help?</b></p> 
<p> Please make a donation of $15, $25, $50, or even $100 today!</p> 
<p>Your donation is both tax-deductible and greatly appreciated. Thank you for 
helping HRC help grassroots animal advocates be more effective!</p> 
<p>Sincerely,</p> 
<p>Che Green</p> 
<p>PS: Do you prefer to donate without using a credit card? HRC happily 
accepts donations via check as well as contributions of stock and bequests.

<b>CANDi Selected as Next Pro 
Bono Project</b> <br>

<p>HRC is excited to announce that we will be partnering with Cats and Dogs 
International (CANDi) to evaluate the influence that stray and suffering 
animals have on tourists. CANDi works to bring tourism businesses together with 
local animal welfare groups to implement programs that humanely address the 
issue of cat and dog overpopulation in destination communities.</p> <br>

<p>CANDi&rsquo;s mission is to save the lives of stray cats and dogs in the 
Caribbean and Mexico through spay, neuter, adoption and educational programs. 
CANDi&rsquo;s focused approach and excellent application made them an ideal fit 
for the Grassroots Research Fund. HRC will work with them to evaluate the 
perceptions and opinions of tourists who have traveled in areas where stray 
animals are common.</p> 
<p>According to Darci Galati, President and Founder of CANDi:</p> 
<blockquote> &ldquo;We are thrilled and grateful that the Humane Research 
Council has selected our project for this grant. We receive numerous emails 
daily from concerned tourists who have had a heartbreaking experience with a 
stray animal while on vacation. By providing solid research on how substantial 
numbers of tourists are negatively affected by such suffering, we can gain the 
support of the travel industry to use their global economic and political clout 
to make lasting and sustainable changes for these animals at international 
tourist destinations.&rdquo;</blockquote> 
<p>Stay tuned for the results of our work with CANDi.&nbsp;</p> <br>
<b>The 
Twin Cities Want to Forego Foie Gras</b> <br>
 &nbsp; 
<p>The first project to be completed under HRC&rsquo;s Grassroots Research 
Fund was in partnership with the Animal Rights Coalition in Minneapolis, 
Minnesota. The group&rsquo;s &ldquo;Forego Foie Gras&rdquo; campaign seeks to 
end the sale and production of foie gras in the Twin Cities area of 
Minneapolis/St. Paul. Foie gras is made from the enlarged livers of force-fed 
ducks and geese and is considered by many to be one of the cruelest foods 
currently on the market.</p> 
<p>To increase their effectiveness, they sought to understand knowledge of and 
attitudes toward foie gras among Twin Cities diners. HRC was excited to help a 
well-organized, focused and driven campaign by creating and administering the 
Twin Cities Dining Survey, which covered knowledge, attitudes, and the general 
dining habits of Twin Cities residents. The final survey is representative of 
adults in the Minneapolis and St. Paul metropolitan areas and it finds an 
overwhelming lack of support for foie gras as a food item.</p> 
<p>So what did we find? Here&rsquo;s a summary:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Three-quarters (74%) of Twin Cities residents support a ban on foie gras 
production in the state of Minnesota.</li> 
<li>Most Twin Cities residents are unfamiliar with foie gras, indicating a 
need for education about foie gras production. Nearly half (44%) of respondents 
indicated that they had never heard of foie gras.</li> 
<li>After learning about how foie gras is produced, nearly half (45%) of 
respondents said they would avoid dining at restaurants that serve foie gras. 
Another 31% of respondents said that they would avoid doing so under certain 
circumstances.</li> </ul>
