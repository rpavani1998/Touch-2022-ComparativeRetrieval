<p> Ask anyone on the street whether they're a cat or a dog person, and 
chances are, they've got a quick answer. Like the choice between Coke or Pepsi, 
or chocolate or vanilla, how you respond to cats versus dogs could say a lot 
about you.</p> 
<p> &quot;Dog people are a little more outgoing,&quot; a dog owner at the 
Westminster Dog Show told ABC News. &quot;Cat people are a little more aloof, 
because that's just how cats are.&quot;</p> 
<p> Karen Hessel, the proud &quot;mama&quot; to 3-year-old Ripley, a golden 
retriever, said, &quot;They say that cats are very intelligent but I haven't 
seen that yet in a cat, but I know my dog is brilliant.&quot;</p> 
<p> Over at the Black Diamond Cat Show in Kimberton, Pa., cat owners were 
telling a different story, saying intelligence is the key difference between 
dog and cat owners. Cat people, they say, are simply smarter.</p> 
<p> &quot;Cats are more independent and so are their owners,&quot; Martha 
Auspitz said.</p> 
<p> She has been showing cats for nearly 40 years and even met her husband, 
Norman, at a cat show.</p> 
<p> &quot;I was into Abyssinians,&quot; he said, &quot;and when I saw Martha's 
Abyssinians, I knew I needed them and when I saw Martha, I said, 'Oh.' So, in 
1982 we were married.&quot;</p> 
<p> According to the American Pet Products Association, 62 percent of U.S. 
households have a pet. Dogs win in the popularity race, with 39 percent of U.S. 
households owning at least one dog, compared with 33 percent of U.S. households 
owning at least one cat.</p> <br>

<p> The nature of why people prefer cats or dogs is a topic that has been 
getting increased research in recent years. Scientists at major academic 
institutions have devoted time and resources to understanding why people become 
one or the other.</p> 
<p> On a practical level, research shows that we tend to gravitate toward the 
animal with which we were raised. Another big factor is living space and age. 
Apartment dwellers in urban areas are more likely to have cats or small dogs, 
while families living in the suburbs are more apt to have larger dogs like 
retrievers or bull mastiffs.</p> 
<p> Parents with young children generally have energetic dogs the kids can 
play with outside, while single people or older people are more inclined to 
have the more low-key cat.</p> 
<p> Whether you're a cat or dog person is often an accident of geography. </p> 
<p> &quot;If you were born in Saudi Arabia, you're more likely to be a cat 
person,&quot; said Harold Herzog, an anthrozoologist studying human-animal 
relationships at Western Carolina University in Cullowhee, N.C. &quot;Dogs 
there are very rarely pets because they're considered vermin.&quot;</p> 
<p> Going deeper than geography or our upbringing, though, scientists believe 
the selection of species can say a lot about people. A major study at the 
University of Texas shows that there really<em>is</em> a difference between 
&quot;dog people&quot; and &quot;cat people.&quot;</p> 
<p> Those who define themselves as &quot;dog people&quot; are more 
extroverted, more agreeable and more conscientious than self-described 
&quot;cat people.&quot; Those who love felines, though, were found to be less 
traditional, more creative and more neurotic.</p> 
<p> Stephen Zawistowski, a science adviser with the American Society for the 
Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, said research tends to fall in line with the 
stereotypes people have already established for themselves.</p> 
<p> &quot;We think of dog people as being the guy at the beach, with his 
Labrador [retriever], and throwing the Frisbee and talking to everybody; and 
the cat lady who sits in her apartment alone with her cats,&quot; he said.</p> 
<p> Back at the Westminster dog show, men who like cats were getting special 
distinction by the dog-owners.</p>
