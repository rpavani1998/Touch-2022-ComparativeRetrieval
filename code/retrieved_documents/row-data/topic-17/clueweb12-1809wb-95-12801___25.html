<p><strong>NUTRITION</strong></p> 
<p><br>
<strong>Try using canned food or pumpkin instead of peanut butter to 
administer pills.</strong></p> 
<p>A tablespoon of peanut butter can contain as many calories as 1/4 of a 13 
oz can or 1/4 cup of dry pet food.&nbsp; In other words, it is highly 
caloric.&nbsp; If you typically use peanut butter to administer pills, try 
putting them in a small amount of canned food or pumpkin instead.&nbsp; These 
options are tasty, but contain fewer calories.</p> 
<p><strong>All healthy dogs benefit from a diet that provides at least a 
moderate amount of protein (&gt;22%).</strong></p> 
<p>Not sure how much protein your dog needs?&nbsp; Here are some general 
guidelines&hellip;&nbsp;High Protein (34% &amp; Up):&nbsp; Active, working, or 
competition adult dogs, or small dogs with a high metabolism.&nbsp; Pregnant or 
lactating dogs also benefit from high protein.&nbsp;Moderate Protein 
(23-33%):&nbsp; All healthy dogs benefit from at least moderate protein levels, 
including seniors.&nbsp; We recommend the high end of moderate for all 
puppies.&nbsp;Low Protein (22% &amp; Under):&nbsp; Dogs experiencing kidney 
disease, renal failure, or specific food allergies.</p> 
<p><strong>Consider mixing in canned pumpkin and/or plain yogurt when 
transitioning your dog to a new food.</strong></p> 
<p>We recommend rotating your dog&rsquo;s food every 3 months. While some dogs 
make the transition from one food to another fairly easily, others may need a 
little help. Adding canned pumpkin during the transitioning period can help 
soothe your dog&rsquo;s sensitive stomach. The combination of soluble and 
insoluble fibers assists in regulating the G.I. tract &ndash; whether things 
are moving too slowly or too fast. Plain yogurt offers probiotics that support 
your dog&rsquo;s immune system and enzymes that help them absorb nutrients. 
Visit theTransitioning &amp; Rotation page in our online Education section for 
more info and tips on effectively switching your dog&rsquo;s food.</p> 
<p><strong>Slowly transition your dog&rsquo;s diet when switching to a new 
food to avoid stomach-upset.</strong></p> 
<p>Effectively switching your pet to and among all-natural foods requires 
careful planning. The process depends partly on how big of a nutritional leap 
you&rsquo;re making. It generally takes more time to transition from a 
&ldquo;grocery store brand&rdquo; to a more nutrient-dense formula because the 
ingredient lists can be quite different. Conversely, the process of 
transitioning among all-natural brands can be less cumbersome. For the best 
results, mix in the new food with the old in ascending 25% intervals (old:new 
&ndash; 75:25, 50:50, 25:75, 0:100) until the transition is complete. Pick up a
<em>Transitioning &amp; Rotation</em> brochure in our lobby for detailed 
transitioning plans, instructions, and tips.</p> 
<p><strong>Focus more on portion control and less on a food&rsquo;s fat 
content to manage your dog&rsquo;s weight.</strong></p> 
<p>Fat has more than twice the calories per gram of protein or carbs, so the 
amount you feed should be limited. Fat, however, is also what best satisfies 
the appetite. A diet that is too low in fat will leave your dog feeling hungry 
all the time, making it harder to stick to a diet plan and potentially leading 
to food-stealing or even poop-eating. It&rsquo;s better to feed a diet with a 
moderate fat content and reduce the portion size as needed rather than feeding 
a low-fat diet.</p> 
<p><strong>Avoid pet foods that contain artificial, chemical preservatives 
like Ethoxyquin, BHA, &amp; BHT.</strong></p> 
<p>Artificial preservatives are added to many lower-quality pet foods because 
they&rsquo;re a cheaper alternative to more natural options like Vitamins C 
&amp; E. But artificial additives aren&rsquo;t just cheaper; many pet parents 
and veterinarians believe they can be dangerous, especially when fed over the 
life of your pet. Ethoxyquin is regulated by the FDA as a pesticide, while BHA 
&amp; BHT have been linked to cancer in laboratory animals.</p> 
<p><strong>Baked pet foods are cooked at lower temperatures than other foods 
to help preserve the nutritional integrity if the ingredients.</strong></p> 
<p>Baked foods are a more dense kibble with less air which allows pets to 
consume more nutrients while eating less. Slow baking allows the flavors and 
aromas of meats and fats to penetrate the whole grains in kibble which makes it 
naturally more palatable. There is less need for sprayed-on fats or nutrients 
with baked foods compared to the extruded varieties. TryLotus baked foods 
&ndash; available at Doguroo!</p> 
<p><strong>Grain-free foods contain little to no grains, are high in protein, 
and are recommended for active, healthy pets.</strong></p> 
<p>The philosophy behind most grain-free formulas is that dogs (and cats) 
primarily ate meat in the wild. Therefore, grain-free foods consist primarily 
of meat (protein), with lesser amounts of fruits and vegetables for vitamins 
and antioxidants. Grain-free foods are also nutrient-dense which means you feed 
less and your dog poops less. Brands offering grain-free formulas available at 
Doguroo include: Acana, Blue Buffalo, Canidae, EVO, Nature&rsquo;s Variety, 
NOW!, Orijen, Solid Gold, Taste of the Wild, and Wellness.</p> 
<p><strong>Limited ingredient foods make use of the fewest ingredients 
possible to create a balanced diet &ndash; great for food-sensitive pets.
</strong></p> 
<p>Many of the allergies from which our pets suffer can be linked to 
ingredients in their food (i.e., grains or certain proteins). Limited 
ingredient formulas typically make use of a handful of nutrient-dense 
ingredients, including a single-source protein, to create a complete and 
balanced diet. This approach limits the number of ingredients to which your pet 
could be allergic. Brands offering limited ingredient formulas available at 
Doguroo include: Blue Buffalo, California Natural, Go!, Natural Balance, and 
Wellness.</p> 
<p><strong>Understand the first 5 ingredients to begin evaluating your 
pet&rsquo;s food.</strong></p> 
<p>Pet food ingredients are listed in order by weight, so ideally you want the 
first few ingredients to be a whole, recognizable protein source, followed by 
whole grains (unless it&rsquo;s a grain-free formula). Study the first 5 
ingredients in your pet&rsquo;s food and at least scan the remainder to weed 
out artificial preservatives, colors, or flavors.<br>
<strong></strong></p> 
<p><strong>Periodically rotate the protein source in your pet&rsquo;s food for 
variety and balanced nutrition.</strong></p> 
<p>There is no <em>one</em> perfectly balanced food for your pet. Each protein 
source has a different makeup of enzymes, vitamins, and minerals. Varying the 
protein in your pet&rsquo;s food will keep them excited about eating and allow 
for complete nutrient intake.</p> 
<p><strong>All-natural pet foods, especially grain-free formulas, often result 
in smaller, firmer poop.</strong></p> 
<p>All-natural pet foods don&rsquo;t use unnecessary fillers such as corn or 
wheat. Instead they typically contain higher amounts of protein. Therefore, it 
takes less all-natural food to meet your pet&rsquo;s nutritional needs. Less 
food equals smaller, firmer poop.<br>
<strong></strong></p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>HEALTH</strong><br>
<br>
<strong>Consider crate training your dog 
to give them a quiet, secure den of their own.</strong></p> 
<p>Dogs are naturally social and love to be around their human or canine 
pack.&nbsp; But they also evolved as den animals, using their den as a place to 
sleep, hide from danger, and raise a family.&nbsp; Dogs that are crate trained 
at an early age feel comfortable and secure in a more cozy space.&nbsp; Often, 
they will travel with less stress and are not tempted to destroy your 
belongings while you&rsquo;re away.&nbsp; Place the crate in a high-traffic 
area in your home and use treats to introduce your dog to their new 
space.&nbsp; Then begin feeding their meals in the crate.&nbsp; Be patient, yet 
persistent until your dog is comfortable in their new, private sanctuary.</p> 
<p><strong>Keep pet grooming wipes by the door to reduce the number of 
allergens in your home.</strong></p> 
<p>Springtime allergies can be tough on dogs and humans alike.&nbsp; To reduce 
the number of allergens in your home and to help relieve your and your 
pet&rsquo;s Springtime allergy symptoms, keep a box of pet grooming wipes by 
the door. Use them to wipe your pet&rsquo;s feet, face, and coat when they come 
in from outdoors.&nbsp; This should help to reduce irritation and minimize the 
amount of pollen in your home.&nbsp; Dog and cat grooming wipes are available 
at The Whole Dog Market!</p> 
<p><strong>Use a flea preventative year-round to protect your pets and your 
home.</strong></p> 
<p>Our relatively warm, wet climate here in the South means that fleas can 
live year-round.&nbsp; Furthermore, adult fleas (the ones we can see on our 
pets) only represent about 5% of the total flea population.&nbsp; Protect your 
pets and your home from flea infestation by using a flea preventative 
year-round.&nbsp; Be sure to choose a product that kills adult fleas and flea 
eggs to break the life cycle.&nbsp; (Thanks toPetWell Veterinary Healthcare for 
contributing)</p> 
<p><strong>Develop an oral care routine with your pet: weekly teeth brushing 
and regular check-ups.</strong></p> 
<p>According to the American Veterinary Dental Society, 80% of dogs show signs 
of gum disease by age three. In fact, periodontal disease is the most commonly 
diagnosed problem in dogs and cats. Keep your pet&rsquo;s teeth and gums 
healthy by: 1) visiting&nbsp;their veterinarian for regular check-ups, 2) 
brushing your pet&rsquo;s teeth at least once a week, 3) feeding an all-natural 
food that&rsquo;s free of artificial preservatives and additives.</p> 
<p><strong>Consider adopting your next pet from an animal shelter or rescue 
organization.</strong></p> 
<p>Pet overpopulation is a big problem in the U.S., especially in the 
South.&nbsp; When you&rsquo;re ready to add to your furry family, consider 
adopting from a local animal shelter or rescue group.&nbsp; There are thousands 
of amazing pets out there (even pure-breeds!) that are just waiting for a 
second chance.&nbsp; Furthermore, most dogs from pet stores or online animal 
dealers come from puppy mills.&nbsp; In many cases, puppy mill dogs are kept in 
inhumane conditions and will never have a shot at a normal, healthy life.&nbsp; 
So help control the pet population and discourage puppy mills by adopting your 
next pet!</p> 
<p><strong>Schedule some cuddle or play time with your dog once a day to 
improve your mood.</strong></p> 
<p>Petting your dog not only makes them happy, but it could lift your spirits 
as well.&nbsp; Researchers at the University of Missouri &ndash; Columbia 
discovered that playing with pets, especially dogs, increases our levels of 
serotonin (a mood-boosting hormone that can help battle depression).&nbsp; So 
as the days get shorter or if you&rsquo;re just having a bad day, make some 
time to cuddle with your canine!</p> 
<p><strong>Successfully introduce your dog to other dogs: exercise beforehand, 
group leash walk, &amp; no eye contact.</strong></p> 
<p>Help your dog successfully greet and interact with other dogs at home or in 
public by following 3 easy steps: 1) Exercise your dog before they meet new 
friends.&nbsp; Exercise can help your dog reach a calm, relaxed state that is 
most appropriate for meeting new dogs.&nbsp; 2) Leash walk your dog with a new 
dog, keeping them a few feet apart to avoid the tension of a one-on-one 
greeting.&nbsp; Engaging in an activity like walking together allows dogs to 
socially acclimate to each other before directly interacting.&nbsp; 3) Make 
sure your dog avoids direct eye contact initially with a new dog.&nbsp; Allow 
them to sniff rear-ends and relax completely before meeting face-to-face.</p> 
<p><strong>Swimming is excellent exercise for dogs, especially for those with 
join or hip ailments.</strong></p> 
<p>Swimming and moving in water is one of the best forms of exercise for your 
dog. The increased resistance to movement, for example, means that a 5-minute 
swim is equivalent to about a 5-mile run. The buoyancy of water also supports 
and lessens stress on the joints, encourages freer movement, and provides a 
safe environment for exercise. Hydrotherapy has even proven to be an effective 
treatment for dogs with arthritis, dysplasia, and other mobility issues.</p> 
<p><br>
<strong>Using human shampoo on your dog can disrupt their skin&rsquo;s 
Ph balance and cause irritation.</strong></p> 
<p>Key biological differences between dogs and humans specify the need for 
totally separate shampoo. Here are a few reasons you should use a shampoo that 
is formulated for pets on your dirty dog: 1) Sulfates (soap/detergents) &ndash; 
Dogs do not eliminate toxins through their skin, and therefore, do not benefit 
from sulfates found in human shampoo. 2) Ph Balance &ndash; A dog&rsquo;s skin 
has a Ph of about 7.5 (human skin: ~5.5). Dog shampoo is formulated to match 
their skin Ph &ndash; it&rsquo;s more alkaline and less likely to cause 
irritation. 3) Sensitive Skin &ndash; A dog&rsquo;s skin is only 3-5 cell 
layers thick (human skin: 10-15 layers). As such, harsh chemicals in human 
shampoo that are easier for us to tolerate can irritate your dog&rsquo;s skin.
</p> 
<p><strong>Protect your pets during winter: Provide indoor shelter and 
minimize exposure to cold weather toxins.</strong></p> 
<p>Cold weather can be just as dangerous for pets as it is for humans. Here 
are a few tips to help keep your pets safe when the mercury drops: 1) Provide a 
warm, indoor place to sleep that is off the ground, away from drafts, and 
includes a cozy bed or warm blanket. 2) Thoroughly wipe your pet&rsquo;s legs, 
paws, and stomach when coming inside from ice or snow to avoid ingestion of 
salt or antifreeze. 3) Use a pet-friendly antifreeze that contains propylene 
glycol rather than ethylene glycol and clean any spills immediately. 4) Never 
shave your pet during the winter months &ndash; they&rsquo;re fur provides 
critical warmth and insulation. Consider jackets or sweaters for short-haired 
breeds. 5) Never let your dog off leash in snow or ice &ndash; especially 
during a snowstorm. They can lose their scent and easily become lost. 6) 
Puppies and older dogs may not tolerate cold weather well. Consider taking them 
outdoors only for potty breaks.</p> 
<p><strong>&ldquo;People food&rdquo; that&rsquo;s safe for your pet: Lean 
meats, some fruits &amp; veggies, and plain rice or pasta.</strong></p> 
<p>Some of us just can&rsquo;t resist sliding scraps under the table to our 
four-legged friends. If you find yourself giving in to that pitiful look on 
your dog&rsquo;s face, it&rsquo;s important to know which foods are least 
likely to harm your pet. If you&rsquo;re enjoying one or more of the following 
items, feel free to share. Lean meats (avoid high fat meats and chicken skin), 
vegetables (carrot sticks, green beans, cucumber or zucchini slices), fruit 
(apple slices, orange slices, bananas &ndash; remove any seeds first), baked 
potatoes (plain, baked), bread (plain, cooked bread with no seeds or raisins), 
and rice or pasta (plain, cooked pasta or white rice).</p> 
<p><strong>Certain &ldquo;people foods&rdquo; can be toxic to your pet, 
including chocolate, grapes/raisins, &amp; garlic.</strong></p> 
<p>Chocolate contains substances called methylxanthines which are toxic to 
pets. Signs of chocolate poisoning include vomiting, diarrhea, panting, and 
excessive thirst. Baking and dark chocolate are most toxic, while ingesting 
lighter chocolates usually results in somewhat milder symptoms. Other foods 
that can be toxic to pets include grapes/raisins, garlic, onions, macadamia 
nuts, and avocado. Poisoning cases typically spike around the holidays, so 
remember to keep a close eye on your pets around Easter, Halloween, 
Thanksgiving, and Christmas.Click here for a more extensive list of toxins and 
poisoning symptoms from the ASPCA Animal Poison Control Center.</p> 
<p><strong>Socialize your dog early and often to achieve balance and stability.
</strong></p> 
<p>Our Pack knows from experience that healthy socialization among dogs is a 
skill that can deteriorate without practice. According to the American 
Veterinary Society of Animal Behavior, &ldquo;The primary and most important 
time for [puppy] socialization is the first 3 months of life.. Every effort 
should be made to expose them to as many different people, well-socialized 
animals, situations, places, etc as possible.&rdquo; Puppy parents, join 
DOGUROO every Saturday, 10:30-11:30am for our FREE Puppy Hour series. If you 
have an adult dog, we strongly recommend Daycare at least once every few weeks 
to sharpen their social skills. It&rsquo;s never too late to challenge your dog 
for the sake of mental and social growth.</p> 
<p><strong>Limit your dog&rsquo;s activity 1 hour before and after meals to 
help prevent bloat.</strong></p> 
<p>Bloat is a life-threatening condition that occurs as a result of an 
abnormal accumulation of air, fluid, or foam in the stomach. As the stomach 
swells, it can rotate 90-360 degrees obstructing veins in the abdomen and 
trapping air, water, and food in the stomach. Larger and/or deep-chested breeds 
are most at risk. To prevent bloat, feed your dog 2-3 times a day and limit 
their activity 1 hour before and after meals. Also consider moderating your 
dog&rsquo;s rate of consumption and avoiding stressful situations (especially 
around mealtimes).</p> 
<p><strong>Signs of heat stroke in dogs include rapid panting, a bright red 
tongue, lethargy, and vomiting.</strong></p> 
<p>Dogs do not have an efficient cooling system (like humans who sweat), and 
can become overheated easily. Signs that your dog could be suffering from heat 
stroke include rapid panting, a bright red tongue, thick, sticky saliva, 
lethargy, dizziness, vomiting, and/or diarrhea. Moderate heat stroke occurs 
when the body temperature reaches 104 degrees. To treat heat stroke, try to 
lower the body temperature by applying cool (not cold) water to your 
dog&rsquo;s face &amp; feet, and increasing air circulation around them with a 
fan. Then promptly take them to your veterinarian.</p> 
<p><strong>Try placing a tennis ball in your dog&rsquo;s food bowl to moderate 
their rate of consumption.</strong></p> 
<p>Most dogs live for mealtime. But devouring their food too quickly can put 
your dog at risk for indigestion or worse, bloat. If your dog doesn&rsquo;t 
savor every bite, try placing a tennis ball in their food bowl to slow them 
down. You can also use treat-release toys during mealtimes &ndash; available at 
Doguroo!</p> 
<p><strong>The many benefits of dog daycare include exercise, socialization, 
and mental stimulation.</strong></p> 
<p>Daycare is more than just a place for your dog to go while you&rsquo;re at 
work. Socialization simulates the pack environment that dogs naturally crave, 
while exercise encourages a healthy metabolism and helps circulate blood to the 
muscles, organs, and brain. Mental stimulation keeps your dog sharp, alert, and 
increases training retention.</p> 
<p><strong>Spaying or neutering helps control pet overpopulation and can have 
lasting health benefits.</strong></p> 
<p>There are many benefits to spaying or neutering you pet, including less 
desire to roam, a reduced risk of certain types of health issues (testicular 
&amp; prostatic in males, mammary in females), a decreased tendency for 
aggressive behavior, and a reduction in the number of unwanted 
cats/kittens/dogs/puppies.<br>
<strong></strong></p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>GROOMING</strong></p> 
<p><strong>Dry your dog thoroughly after swimming or bathing to help prevent 
hot spots.</strong></p> 
<p>Hot spots are surface skin infections that occur most commonly during the 
Summer months. Though any dog can develop a hot spot, medium and long-haired 
breeds are most susceptible. Here are a few ways you can help your dog to avoid 
the irritation and discomfort of hot spots:&nbsp; 1) Dry your dog thoroughly 
after swimming or bathing. Wet hair against the skin prevents proper air 
circulation and can quickly lead to a hot spot.&nbsp; 2) Use a flea 
preventative or repellent product. It&rsquo;s no coincidence that both fleas 
and hot spots are most common in the Summer. Persistent scratching is one of 
the most common causes of hot spots.&nbsp; 3) Comb your dog regularly and have 
them professionally groomed every 4-6 weeks. A healthy coat with no matts or 
tangles is much less likely to harbor excess bacteria.</p> 
<p><strong>Have your dog&rsquo;s undercoat removed instead of shaving to keep 
them cool in the Summer.</strong></p> 
<p>Guard hairs in your dog&rsquo;s top coat protect them from the sun&rsquo;s 
harmful rays, while the fluffy undercoat helps insulate them from the cold. We 
recommend the Shed-Less Treatment during the Summer months to remove your 
dog&rsquo;s undercoat instead of a full body shave. The Shed-Less Treatment 
involves using a specially-formulated blend of shampoo and conditioner to 
loosen the dead undercoat hair. Then the Grooming staff gently brushes away 
this extra insulation leaving those important guard hairs in place.</p> 
<p><strong>Grinding vs. cutting can leave your dog&rsquo;s nails shorter, 
smoother, and less likely to leave scratch marks.</strong></p> 
<p>Grinding your dog&rsquo;s nails is a great alternative to cutting them with 
nail clippers. Grinding, or &ldquo;dremeling,&rdquo; usually shortens the quick 
over time and leaves the tip of the nail smooth and rounded. If you&rsquo;re 
apprehensive about grinding or cutting your dog&rsquo;s nails, our Pack of 
bathers and groomers will be happy to do it for you!</p> 
<p><strong>Place cotton balls in your dog&rsquo;s ears during a bath to 
prevent ear infections.</strong></p> 
<p>Water in your dog&rsquo;s ears can cause irritation or infection and can 
become a serious medical issue. Use cotton balls to absorb any water that gets 
past your dog&rsquo;s outer ear openings at bath time. This method can be 
especially useful for dogs with cropped ears.</p> 
<p><strong>You can bathe your dog as often twice a week using natural, mild 
shampoos.</strong></p> 
<p>A dog&rsquo;s skin is more sensitive than that of a human, but they can be 
bathed often with the right shampoos. Select all-natural or organic shampoos 
that don&rsquo;t contain harsh chemicals and wash away! Bathing your dog more 
often can also reduce the number of allergens in your home.</p> 
<p><strong>Most dogs in the South shed year-round. Shedless Treatment anyone?
</strong></p> 
<p>Because of the mild temperatures in the South, some dogs will shed 
year-round. And because most of our dogs live indoors, they no longer have a 
cue from Mother Nature to grow and shed their undercoat seasonally. The 
Shedless Treatment at Doguroo helps remove your dog&rsquo;s undercoat all at 
once and can reduce shedding significantly.<br>
<strong></strong></p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>CATS</strong></p> 
<p><strong>Cats prefer to eat from a plate or a gradually sloped bowl with no 
vertical sides.</strong></p> 
<p>Why? Those wonderful whiskers! More than twice as thick as ordinary hairs, 
a cat&rsquo;s whiskers are packed with nerve endings that provide 
extraordinarily detailed information about their surroundings. Your cat uses 
it&rsquo;s whiskers to gauge air movements &amp; pressure as well as the size 
&amp; shape of any object close by. But whiskers can also be a bother to your 
cat, especially if they try to eat from a bowl. Whiskers touching the sides of 
a bowl transfer irritating sensations to the brain, making it difficult to 
continue eating. To avoid irritation at mealtime, try feeding your cat from a 
flat plate or an elevated, gradually sloped bowl with no vertical sides. Ask 
our Pack about the options available at DOGUROO!</p> 
<p><strong>Cats require a high fluid intake &ndash; we recommend feeding 
canned foods.</strong></p> 
<p>Cats are more susceptible to kidney crystals and urinary tract blockages, 
and therefore, require a higher fluid intake than dogs. They are also true 
carnivores, which means the prey they evolved eating in the wild consisted 
primarily of water, protein, and fat. The high moisture content in canned food 
most closely mimics their diet in the wild and is a great option for cats. We 
also recommend using a cat water fountain, which uses a small pump to keep the 
water moving constantly. Most cats will drink more water if it is moving and 
holds their interest.<br>
