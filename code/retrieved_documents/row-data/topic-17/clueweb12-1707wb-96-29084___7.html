Hawthorne 
was a stray but we're pretty certain he's arussian blue or at least part 
because he looks just like one. So I was wondering if most Blues act like him.
<br> <br>
He's very shy, he hides when anyone comes, he even hides from my 
husband sometimes. He will only let me pet him and cuddles with me, and has 
finally recently started warming up to my husband. He gets startled very 
easily. I was always afraid that maybe he was abused as akitten, but I thought 
I'd ask if it's normaly for most blues. <br>

<br> It could be both, especially if you cat isn't used to people other than 
you and your spouse. However, I have read that Russian Blues become attached to 
one or two people and are really loyal. Our Blue really doesn't like it when 
people come into the house. A few people he'll sniff after while and be okay 
with, but others he'll hiss at and hide from. <br>

I still suck my- thumb...

Hi, there 
--<br>
<br>
I've had two blues -- my bridge baby, Felix and my almost-year old, 
Coopurr. Both of them are/were very attached to me. Felix would often hide when 
people came over to the house, and most of the time, Coopurr does the same.<br>

<br>Coop and Felix are also both alike in the sense that they both are/were 
&quot;one-parent cats&quot; -- following me all over the house, showing me tons 
of affection, and generally just trying to involve themselves in whatever I'm 
doing.<br>
<br>
Hope this helps! <br>
Coop (and Felix's) Mommy <br>

<br> Well we just got out 7 year old Russian Blue monday night. He doesnt seem 
shy at all. He is one of the most affectionet and vocal cats I have ever owned. 
He greets us when we come home and follows us around the house, talking to us. 
he likes to have his belly rubbed and will &quot;paw&quot; us if we stop 
petting him and he isnt done yet. Now the people we got him from had him for 7 
years and he seems to be adjusting very well to new parents. I guess my 
&quot;blue&quot; doenst have a problem with new people. He hasnt been around 
anyone else but us yet, so we will see if he gets shy and hides <br>
