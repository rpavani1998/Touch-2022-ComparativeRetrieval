Cat owners 'more educated than dog owners' <br>
Cat 
owners 'more educated than dog owners' <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
 Cats have long 
been thought to be cleverer than dogs - and now it seems the same is true of 
their owners.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
 The combined cat and dog population of 
Britain is more than 20.8 million, 50 per cent higher than previously thought

<br>
People with cats are more likely to have 
university degrees than those with dogs, according to a scientific survey of 
pet ownership.<br>
<br>
The study also revealed that the combined cat and dog 
population of Britain is more than 20.8 million - 50 per cent higher than 
previously thought.<br>
<br>
Researchers at the University of Bristol say that 
the superior intelligence of cat owners is unlikely to be caused by their 
exposure to the famously cunning and selfish pets.<br>
<br>
Rather, more 
educated people tend to work longer hours and choose a pet to fit their 
lifestyles. Unlike dogs, cats require no walking and can manage with little 
human company.<br>
<br>
Dr Jane Murray, Cats Protection Lecturer in Feline 
Epidemiology, who led the study, said: &quot;We don't think it is associated 
with income because that was one of the variables we looked at, and there was 
little difference.<br>
<br>
&quot;Cats require less time per day than a dog, so 
they are more popular with educated people who work late and have long 
commutes.&quot;<br>
<br>
Homes with degree-holders were 1.36 times more likely 
to have a cat than other households. The same homes were less likely to have a 
dog than households where no-one went to university.<br>
<br>
The study, 
published in the Veterinary Record journal, also found that cat owners were 
more likely to be older and female. Both cat and dog owners were more likely 
than the general population to live in households with gardens in rural areas.
<br> <br>
As part of the study 2,980 people were interviewed about their pet 
ownership, geography and educational background. Combining the results with 
census information produced new figures for Britain's pet population - 10.3 
million cats and 10.5 million dogs. The numbers do not include strays.<br>
<br>

Previous estimates had put the totals at 7.2 million and 7.3 million 
respectively<br>
<br>
Dr Jane Murray said: &quot;We are confident that our 
figures are the most accurate yet. The other estimates are produced by the pet 
food industry and have not been published in peer reviewed journals. We are not 
saying there has been a huge spike in the cat and dog populations - we are just 
getting better at counting them.&quot;<br>
<br>
Researchers at the university's 
Department of Clinical Veterinary Science hope to repeat the study 2011, to 
monitor any changes in population numbers and ownership trends.<br>
<br>
The 
popular myth of cat intelligence was dented last year with the publication of a 
study showing that they did worse than dogs at a simple reasoning task. Cats 
presented with two pieces of string, only one of which was attached to a food 
reward, could not tell which one to pull for their treat.<br>
