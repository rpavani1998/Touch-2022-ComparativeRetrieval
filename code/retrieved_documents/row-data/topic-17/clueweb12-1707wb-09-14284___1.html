<h2>Writer's Block: Raining cats or dogs?</h2>

<p>Do you have a decided preference between cats and dogs? Which do you 
prefer, and why? Would you consider a roommate or partner who had a contrary 
pet proclivity?</p>

 I have never liked a person who hated 
cats(I rarely meet people who hate dogs). I prefer cats,but I like dogs. I like 
the comfort cats bring along with their independence. It's great to curl up 
with a cat and read a book. I think that I like the quirky personality of cats 
the most, they're so funny. Dogs are fun because they're great activity 
partners. I don't like dogs that bark incessantly or drool, but calm and quiet 
dogs are my friend.<br>
<br>
I can see myself with six cats and a dog in the 
future. My favorite dogs are whippets.<br>
<br>
I would not want a roommate or 
partner that dislikes cats or dogs.
