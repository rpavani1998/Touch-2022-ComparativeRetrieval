Environmental Enrichment for Cats and Dogs</strong><br>
<br>
Environmental 
Enrichment consists of ways to make sure that your pet's needs are met. This is 
important for all cats and dogs, but especially&nbsp;for cats and dogs who are 
indoor-only and pets that are left alone while you are work. Indoor-only cats 
can become bored or lazy. Dogs left alone can become bored and destructive. 
Environmental Enrichment is a great way to prevent problems and is an important 
part of caring for your pet.<br>
<br>
<strong>Ideas for Cats:</strong> 
<ul> 
<li>Have <strong>exercise play sessions </strong>every single day. Toys such 
as laser lights can satisfy your cat's natural instinct to chase and hunt. </li>
<li>Let your cats have shelves or a cat tree to <strong>climb upward</strong>. 
</li> 
<li>Find <strong>new games </strong>to play with your cat such as hiding food 
in new and different areas, so your cat knows to search for it. 
<ul> 
<li>Try dividing up the food that your cat normally eats&nbsp;during the day 
and hiding it on little plates throughout your home. This will allow your cat 
to &quot;hunt&quot; for his/her food.</li> </ul></li> 
<li>Leave <strong>different cat toys </strong>out on different days, so there 
are new objects for your cat to play with.</li> 
<li><strong>Cat toys DO NOT have to be expensive</strong>. Some cat favorites 
are: 
<ul> 
<li>Paper bags with the end rolled up, so that cats can get inside</li> 
<li>A crumpled up piece of paper</li> 
<li>A toilet paper tube</li> 
<li>Some dried rice or beans in a film container</li> 
<li>A few kibble inside a plastic easter egg </li> 
<li>A toy or a bit of cardboard attached to the end of an old fishing pool 
(just be sure there is no hook!)</li> 
<li>Be creative!</li> </ul></li> 
<li>Leave the <strong>radio on or the TV </strong>on a nature channel, or a 
repeatingCatNip Video for your cat to watch.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li> 
<li>Make sure your cat has <strong>places to scratch</strong>. Some cats 
prefer to scratch horizontally and some vertically. They also prefer different 
materials: cardboard, carpet, fabric, wood, or rope. Also, vertical scratching 
posts need to be tall enough and sturdy enough for your cat to stretch out 
completely and not knock it over.</li> </ul> 
<p><strong></strong>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Environmental Enrichment Resources for Cats:</strong></p> 
<ul> 
<li>Ohio State University's Indoor Cat Initiative explains the importance of 
environmental enrichment, cat's needs, problem solving and more. A very 
thorough and interesting web site.</li> 
<li>Critter Chatter provides more Environmental Enrichment ideas, including 
some easy to make toys.</li> </ul> 
<p><strong></strong>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Ideas for Dogs:</strong> <br>
<em>Different breeds of dogs need 
different amounts of excercise and mental stimulation. Basic training can help 
alleviate your dog's boredom and improve your relation with him/her. Some would 
also benefit from Agility&nbsp;Training. See ourResources Page for more 
information.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em><br>
</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Be sure that your dog has both <strong>toys to play with </strong>and 
<strong>items to chew on</strong>.&nbsp;They serve two different and important 
purposes.</li> 
<li>Toys that allow you to hide some of your dog's food inside, making your 
dog work for his meal. This can keep your dog busy and out of trouble. (Please 
adjust your dog's meals accordingly so that your dog is not over-fed.) 
<ul> 
<li>You can also take some of your dog's canned food and put it in a toy, such 
as a Kong toy, and then freeze it. This will give your dog something exciting 
several hours after you have left for the day.</li> 
<li>Be careful choosing toy's for your dog and please remember that no toy is 
indestructible.</li> </ul></li> 
<li>Like cats, dogs often appreciate <strong>music </strong>or&nbsp;some other 
type of sound.</li> 
<li><strong>Rotate your dog's toys</strong> so that s/he does not become bored 
with it.</li> 
<li>Consider having someone come by to walk your dog during the middle of the 
day.</li> </ul><strong>If your cat or dog is destructive, please remember that 
there may be an underlying medical reason. Please mention any behavioral 
concerns at your next exam.</strong> <br>
