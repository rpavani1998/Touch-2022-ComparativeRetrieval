<p></p> 
<p>We know this is not always possible, so we can help you re-home your dog. 
It would be ideal if the dog could remain in your home until a foster or 
placement is found, otherwise we require a financial contribution to cover 
boarding and medical costs.</p> 
<p>We get to know our dogs very well and take great pride in matching the 
right dog with the right family. Fosters, volunteers, sponsors and 
contributions welcome Helps us help those who are really in need</p>  Come Meet 
our Pets  Pets can be seen on the internet, and at a kennel in Brooklyn, and 
sometimes at a kennel in PA. Meetings are by appointment only.  Our Adoption 
Process  There is an application to fill out. References are required. Once 
that is is completed, we do a home visit. Fees range from $200.00 -$250.00 (but 
we do make special considerations) All dogs are fully vaccinated, altered, 
micro-chipped and heartworm tested.<br>
There is also an adoption contract to 
sign.We usually respond to inquiries within a couple days. If we do not 
respond, please write back it is never intentional.<br>
We encourage you to 
take your time before adopting.<br>
Several meetings, fostering. <br>
If we 
don't have the right dog for you, we will help you find it<br>
We get quite 
attached to our adoptees and encourage adopters to keep us posted on their new 
pet <br>

<p>Dog adoption and cat adoption saves lives. Adopt a dog or adopt a cat and 
you'll have a friend for life! What is the difference between adopting a dog, 
adopting a cat, adopting a kitten or adopting a puppy versus getting dogs for 
sale, cats for sale, puppies for sale or kittens for sale from a dog breeder or 
a cat breeder? When someone is breeding puppies or breeding kittens, they are 
creating new dogs and cats who need homes. Some people are interested in a very 
specific breed of dog, cat, puppy or kitten and they think the only way to find 
that specific breed is to buy a dog for sale or buy a cat for sale from a puppy 
breeder or a kitten breeder. Yet animal shelters are filled with dogs and cats 
who must find homes. So rather than buying a dog or puppy for sale from a dog 
breeder or buying a cat or kitten for sale from a cat breeder, we encourage 
people to adopt a dog, adopt a cat, adopt a puppy or adopt a kitten at their 
local animal shelter, SPCA, humane society or pet rescue group.</p> <br>
