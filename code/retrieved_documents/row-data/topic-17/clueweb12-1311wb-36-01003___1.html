 I am, as you must admit, abysmally ineffective at 
the polite forms of discourse that grease the wheels of social interaction.

What happened? <br>
<br>
Eh, dogs don't like me too much. But then again, my 
fuzzy feelings for cats may just be because a neighbor's dog pack tried to take 
a chunk out of my leg. Only one of them managed to actually bite me...&gt;.&gt;

 Aw, well I'm sorry about that <br>
It was really sad, my mom 
wanted to get my little sister a cat, and so we went and picked out a kitten 
for her, but Meeka didn't like her at all...She became my cat somehow <br>
<br>

 Really? XD....EVIL you say? I see ...Well, as long as you like one or the 
other you'll have friends everwhere XD<br>

 I see  Cats used to hate me, but I win them over 
with treats I'm a manipulative person <br>
<br>
Yeah...but I'm not complaining  
Meeka is really sweet and she follows me around the house...but she does like 
to sit down on my hands and drawings while I'm working to demand 
attention...She's high matinence <br>
<br>
XD Ah, so the small dog is 
compensating for its size eh? <br>
