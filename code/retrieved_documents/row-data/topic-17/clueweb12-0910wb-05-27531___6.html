<p><b>VET EXAMINATION</b><br>
After adopting a pet from us you may take 
him/her to the Veterinarian of your choice (in Yakima County) within 3 business 
days for a complimentary exam. We strongly encourage you to make and keep this 
appointment as this helps to assess the general overall health of the animal. 
You will need to present both shelter receipts upon arrival to verify that your 
pet was adopted from the Humane Society of Central Washington. These receipts 
will also tell the Veterinarian what vaccinations and procedures your new pet 
may have received during his/her stay at our facility.</p>
<p><b>RENTERS</b><br>
If you rent and wish to adopt please be prepared to 
provide the Humane Society staff with authorization from your landlord 
verifying that it is acceptable for you to have pets in your home.</p>
<p><b>ILLNESS</b><br>
We do our best to ensure that the pet you adopt is in 
good health. Unfortunately, due to the nature of this business we do not always 
know their health or behavioral history. We also have no way of knowing what 
they may have been exposed to prior to coming to the shelter. If your pet 
becomes ill within 14 days of adoption you have two options:</p>
<p>If you choose to keep your pet you may seek treatment at your own expense. 
The Humane Society of Central Washington is not responsible for any 
Veterinarian bills that you may incur.</p>
<p>For a return/refund you must take your pet to a Veterinarian and have him 
indicate the cause of illness and write a diagnosis on the Adoption Receipt. 
Then bring your pet, the signed Adoption receipts and all other documents 
received during the Adoption process to the shelter and you will be issued a 
refund or an exchange, whichever you prefer. The exchange is good for up to one 
year from the date you returned the ill pet to us.</p></li> <br>

<p>Dog adoption and cat adoption saves lives. Adopt a dog or adopt a cat and 
you'll have a friend for life! What is the difference between adopting a dog, 
adopting a cat, adopting a kitten or adopting a puppy versus getting dogs for 
sale, cats for sale, puppies for sale or kittens for sale from a dog breeder or 
a cat breeder? When someone is breeding puppies or breeding kittens, they are 
creating new dogs and cats who need homes. Some people are interested in a very 
specific breed of dog, cat, puppy or kitten and they think the only way to find 
that specific breed is to buy a dog for sale or buy a cat for sale from a puppy 
breeder or a kitten breeder. Yet animal shelters are filled with dogs and cats 
who must find homes. So rather than buying a dog or puppy for sale from a dog 
breeder or buying a cat or kitten for sale from a cat breeder, we encourage 
people to adopt a dog, adopt a cat, adopt a puppy or adopt a kitten at their 
local animal shelter, SPCA, humane society or pet rescue group.</p> <br>
