 Rarely, because most of the time it seems to be not in my 
medium of art. :&lt;<br>

sometimes.... it depends a bit on prizes, but is mostly limited by the fact 
that I take a long time to create anything i'm happy with and I am often too 
busy to meet deadlines.<br>

 i tried to enter in the EVE online contest, 
but even though i gave it my best i wasn't even considered in any of the line 
up. So i don't think i'm doing a contest again.<br>

 if it's something i absolutely must and i end up making 
something i'm pretty proud of. So essentially, no, i don't enter contests often

 depends 
on who is having the contest, the prizes, the deadline and if the theme 
inspires me. :]<br>
I never bother to enter contests that the community offers. 
There are way too many awesome entries and usually the winner is the one who 
has the most favs. Which usually is the most popular person on the site so...
<br>yeah. lol. <br>
