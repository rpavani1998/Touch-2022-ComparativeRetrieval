<h1>  How many is too many cats? </h1> 
<p> </p> We've all heard about the old lady with too many cats, however, how 
many cats are too many? Some say 2 some say 4 and other's have their home 
entirely filled with feline friends.<br>
<br>
I did cover the financial cost in 
Monday's blog stated that throughout the course of a cats lifetime it will cost 
$10,000 in vet bills and care. Owning more than one cat when one can barely 
afford one seems in my opinion both financially and emotionally irresponsible.
<br> <br>
Cats prefer to be independent and have a hard enough time adjusting 
to another new cat in the household, let alone more than 1. It's the nature of 
the beast.<br>
<br>
Think of a house full of cats as a reality show full of 
girls, there's a lot of drama amongst the pack. There's a reason why they refer 
to girls as catty.<br>
<br>
I can understand the need to have more than one cat 
as companionship. Cats are independent and very self sufficient. Having another 
cat makes up the difference in love whenever one cat(s) decides to indulge in 
his/her independence.<br>
<br>
The rule of thumb according to some pet owners 
is that the affection and need of 1 dog is equivalent to 3 cats.<br>
<br>

Multiple cats can often lead to anxiety amongst the pack leading to other 
health issues that otherwise wouldn't present with a single or pair of cats. It 
is possible that more than 1 cat can coexist; however, cats are more likely to 
have personality conflicts than dogs.<br>
<br>
There are of course ways to make 
an ideal living situation for multiple cats:<br>
<br>
Make sure that each cat 
has their own specific room or place to retreat from the other's.<br>
<br>
When 
introducing a new cat to the family, keep him/her in a large crate until he/she 
is familiar and comfortable with the other cats and vice versa. Cats take up to 
a month, personality depending, to decided whether they are compatible or not.
<br> <br>
In addition to the large vet bills, it will take more than an hour to 
clean up. The smell from accidental urination, you can kiss dinner parties and 
get togethers with human friends good-bye.<br>
<br>
I often have many customers 
call who I like to refer to as &quot;collectors&quot; who think that they're 
doing a charitable cause by rescuing many cats and housing them. Although, 
admirable financially, emotionally and socially, it is best to leave the care 
to the shelters rather than taking the responsibility on your own.<br>
<br>
I 
to have a soft heart as well, however, hear so many customers on pensions 
trying to rescue cats when they can't even take care of themselves. If you want 
to do your part, most shelters welcome donations in the form of volunteer, 
money and or toys or foods.<br>

<p>I find it interesting to read the comments people make about what to do 
with too many cats.<br>
<br>
Yes...it would be wonderful if you found a stray 
and took it to the shelter and it got adoopted BUT as many of us know, it does 
not always work that way.<br>
<br>
many people have multiple pets not by 
choice, but by circumstance. Shelters are so over populated that they are 
turning people away...then what?!<br>
<br>
If you have a heart, you cannot dump 
the poor animal on the street and if no shelter will take it...you end up with 
another cat.<br>
<br>
I would be willing to be a million dollars that i do not 
have, that most people with 5 or more cats or dogs, did not intentionally go 
out and say..ummm...how many animals can i bring home.<br>
<br>
Because our 
shelters are full and the Government seems to think the stray animal population 
is not their problem, indivduals that are caring and good try to do it on their 
own.<br>
<br>
For all those people who like to comment on a crazy cat 
lady...why don't you adopt one or 2 of her cats and she won't have as many!</p>

<p>I am also one of those people that have too many cats. There is no shelter 
that will take cats now,and thank goodness that our APL is overcrouded and will 
not take them. I know that all that will happen is they will end up putting 
that cat to sleep,so to me that is like signing their death warrent. Wish that 
I had some place to take most of these cats. I do have around 20 cats now!<br>
 
If you can help me olease do</p> &nbsp; </dd>

<p>I agree with you. I have a household with many cats and the one cat 
outdoors just had 5 kitties on Memorial Day Eve. Anyway,I know that I have too 
many pets(21 cats in all indoors)and I realize that most need to go to a place 
where they can be happy and run,however there is just no place around here.<br>

 My husband brought most of these cats home from work,I only had 1 ten years 
ago when I got married. My backyard is a Pet Cemetery now.<br>
 I really wish 
that there was a place I could take these cats where they could run. Most,since 
I cannot afford the vet bills have not even seen a vet,I don't want the cats to 
go to a shelter and then be put to sleep!<br>
 Most places also won't take a 
cat unless it has had it shots.<br>
If anyone is reading this and they know of 
somewhere that is safe and humane in Ohio(Cleveland) and not the APL 
either,they will kill your pet after 3 days,please let me know,though most 
places also are full now.</p> &nbsp; </dd> </dl>
