Dogs rule, cats drool: Americans 
prefer pups <br>
A new survey shows that dogs are the most loved animals in 
America. <br>
<br>

Cat owners love their feline friends, but the results of a recent survey are 
clear: America is a dog country. The poll, conducted by the Associated Press 
and Petside.com, found that 74 percent of all Americans like dogs a lot, while 
just 41 percents like cats a lot. Among pet owners specifically, those numbers 
jump to 84 percent and 49 percent, respectively. Conversely, 2 percent of all 
survey respondents said they dislike dogs a lot, while 15 percent said they 
dislike cats a lot.
<p>The survey results don&rsquo;t stop there. Sixty-eight percent of pet 
owners like both dogs and cats, while 26 percent like only dogs, and 3 percent 
like only cats. Seventy-four percent of the 1,166 respondents who identified 
themselves as pet owners have a dog, and 47 percent own a cat.</p> 
<p>What do these numbers mean for your veterinary clinic? Considering that 20 
percent of pet owners surveyed said they dislike cats at least a little, it 
could be evidence of a disturbing trend in feline healthcare: uneducated pet 
owners. Read &ldquo;Get cats out of the shadows&rdquo; and check out our Feline 
Health Center for tips on educating your clients and giving patients&mdash;cats 
and dogs&mdash;the care they deserve.</p> <br>
