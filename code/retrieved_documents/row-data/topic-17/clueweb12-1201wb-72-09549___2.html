 Some dogs are really cute to look at, but I definitely like 
cats more. Drooling and barking is very annoying after awhile. I have to share 
a home with three little dogs, and my poor cat stays hidden in my room most of 
the time. Reply<b></b> <br>

 Aww~ Yeah, I guess there 
are a few exceptions here and there ^___^<br>
<br>
I've never really had my own 
dog, but I've lived with my grandmother's dog.. she was really sweet ^w^<br>

<br>Aww~ That's horrible! ;w; The dogs don't like the cat?? T__T <br>

<br>  They don't try to hurt her, but they pick on her and chase her around, 
and she thinks she's too good to be with dogs anyways. xD<br>
<br>
She's a very 
spoiled cat, but still sweet. Reply<b></b> <br>
