<h2>News &amp; Opinion</h2> 
<h3>Steve Wozniak: The Original Macintosh Was a Failure</h3> 
<p>Macworld UK's Ben Camm-Jones reports that Apple cofounder Steve Wozniak, 
speaking on Sunday MIDDAY (see below), a program run on India's NDTV network, 
conceded that theApple III had been a failure - something that few would 
dispute - but also said that the Macintosh had been a failure too.</p> 
<p>&quot;The Apple III was a failure, the Lisa was a failure, and the 
[original] Macintosh was a failure. It was only by modifying the Macintosh 
hugely and over time that we made it a good computer,&quot; Wozniak is quoted 
saying.</p> 
<p>Publisher's note: I consider the Macintosh 128K pretty much a 
proof-of-concept machine, because it really didn't have enough memory to do 
much. Steve Jobs unveiled the original Macintosh using a custom machine with 
512 KB of memory, and theMacintosh 512K (a.k.a. Fat Mac) was the first model 
with enough memory to be fairly useful. Despite that, Mac sales fell like a 
rock in 1985. It took theMac Plus, introduced in January 1986, to really turn 
things around for the Macintosh, adding a high-speed SCSI port for hard drives 
along with a full 1&nbsp;GB of memory - expandable to 4&nbsp;GB when higher 
capacity chips became available.<i>dk</i></p>

<h3>Interview with Steve Wozniak</h3> 
<p>Sunday MIDDAY's Sachin Kalbag recently interviewed &quot;the other 
Steve&quot; - Steve Wozniak, Apple's cofounder and the designer of the earliest 
Apple computers.</p> 
<p>&quot;Steve Wozniak, supreme geek of the 1970s and the maker of the Apple 
II computer which brought about a worldwide computer revolution, was in 
Bangalore [India] on Saturday to speak to a bunch of young entrepreneurs and 
achievers of the Young Presidents Organisation who wanted to hear the story of 
the most-loved technology brand in the world - Apple.</p> 
<p>&quot;Wozniak co-founded Apple Computer (now Apple, Inc.) in April 1976 
along with Steve Jobs and Ronald Wayne. Both Apple I - the company's first 
product - and the hugely successful Apple II (arguably the world's first 
fully-loaded personal computer) were designed by Wozniak, making him - and not 
Jobs - the darling of geeks around the world.</p> 
<p>&quot;Jobs may have created the Apple brand, but it was Wozniak's initial 
work on the company's first two products that made Apple a multi-million dollar 
company within a year of its founding. Now 61 years old, Wozniak is still an 
Apple employee with a minimum pay and goes around the world representing the 
company - giving speeches and mentoring young engineers.&quot;</p> 
<p>Publisher's note: Perhaps the most significant factor in the success of the 
Apple II wasn't the computer itself but the fact that it was the first home 
computer (as we called them back then) with arelatively affordable 5-1/4&quot; 
floppy drive. Until then, floppy drive controllers were expensive, and most 
floppy drives were of the 8&quot; variety, and most home computers used 
cassette tape for storage and a TV set as a monitor. Floppies were much faster 
and easier to work with than tapes, giving Apple a real leg up on the 
competition.<i>dk</i></p>

<h3>Refurbished Mac Buying Guide</h3> 
<p>Macworld's Joel Mathis says that if you're on a budget and need a new 
computer, but you're an Apple fan and even with limited cash you'd rather not 
buy an inexpensive Windows-based PC, the solution is easy: Buy a refurbished 
Mac.</p> 
<p>Mathis notes that the Apple Online Store has a section where you can buy 
refurbished Macs, as well as refurbished iPads, iPods, and other Apple 
products. (The refurbs are listed under the Special Deals section of the left 
column of the online store.), with the Mac selection running the gamut from 
laptop computers to Mac minis to iMacs with giant 27&quot; monitors. Some of 
the machines are preowned, while others were returned to the company because of 
technical defects. But all of them share two characteristics in common: They've 
been buffed, restored, and repackaged to meet Apple's exacting standards. And 
they're cheaper than buying new, yet carry the exact same warranty and 
AppleCare eligibility as new Macs.</p> 
<p>Mathis notes that before resale, Apple cleans the machine, replaces any 
defective or substandard parts, reinstalls software that originally shipped 
with the unit, tests the Mac for quality-control issues, then repackages it 
with fresh cables and a users manual. The company even stamps the machine with 
a new serial number. Arguably, an ACR unit is more thoroughly vetted for issues 
and defects than a new one is, and meet's the company's Finished Goods testing 
procedures which means that it should be up to the same technical standards as 
the exact same unit purchased brand-new.</p> 
<p>The last two Mac systems your editor has purchased have been Apple 
Certified Refurbished machines, and both arrived cosmetically indistinguishable 
from new and have been flawless performers (the newest one now being nearly 
three years old). Likewise for two Certified Refurbished iPods.</p> 
<p>Likewise, the last three &quot;new&quot; Macs your publisher has purchased 
(all of them eMacs) have also been Apple Certified Refurbished machines, and 
they were just like new when they arrived. I would not hesitate to buy another 
Apple Certified Refurb.</p> 
<p>You can find prices on refurbs in our various deal trackers, which we try 
to update at least once a month.</p>

<h3>Should We Stop Classifying the iPad as a PC?</h3> 
<p>Have we started?</p> 
<p>Tech.pinions contributor Patrick Moorhead is critical of market research 
firm Canalys' decision to break from the analyst pack and include touchscreen 
tablets in its PC sales metrics, a revision that has put Apple is on track to 
become leading global PC vendor, given the phenomenal success of the iPad. 
Moorhead says the reclassification got him thinking about what a PC is and how 
wide this definition goes.</p> 
<p>Moorhead emphasizes that he's not debating whether, at least for some 
users, a tablet can perform tasks they would otherwise be doing with a laptop 
or desktop PC, but rather industry classification of the device. He proposes 
some multipoint criteria to help qualify PC-ness.</p> 
<p>Editor's note: In my estimation, tablets like the iPad meet all of 
Moorhead's criteria. I think Canalys is on the right track in including tablets 
as PC sales and will become even more right as time passes. I addressed this 
topic at some length in a column on MacPrices earlier this week, iPad And Me; 
Will Tablets Ever Be A Satisfactory Laptop Substitute? <i>cm</i></p> 
<p>Publisher's note: I would go so far as to classify any smartphone that can 
run apps as a personal computer, albeit a very small one. What's more personal 
than a computer you can put in your pocket? However, the industry likes to have 
clear-cut categories, and just as the early Apple, Tandy, and Commodore home 
computers created a new category (<i>home computers</i> or <i>microcomputers</i>
 - in contrast to mainframes and minicomputers - and later<i>personal computers
</i>), the iPad is creating a new category that is neither a smartphone nor a 
conventional PC. In time, the industry will come to some consensus as to 
whether the tablet belongs in the PC category or is really a different kind of 
device. My leaning is toward the different kind of device, as tablets do not 
run desktop operating systems or software, are generally not designed to work 
with keyboard and mouse input, and sometimes don't even have USB or flash card 
slots. Time will tell.<i>dk</i></p>

<h3>The Personal Computer Is Dead: Apple Killed It</h3> 
<p>Writing for Technology Review, Jonathan Zittrain says the PC is dead, with 
rising popularity of mobile, lightweight, cloud-centric devices not merely 
representing a change in form factor. Rather, he says we're witnessing an 
unprecedented shift of power from end users and software developers to 
operating system vendors - and even those who keep using PCs are being swept 
along.</p> 
<p>Zittrain considers these developments to be a little for the better, and 
much for the worse. Your editor agrees.</p> 
<p>Mr. Zittrain is a professor of law and computer science at Harvard 
University, and author of<i>The Future of the Internet and How to Stop It,</i> 
in which he forecast the transformation from product to service, noting that 
for decades PC users enjoyed a simple way for people to create software and 
share or sell it to others.</p> 
<p>He notes that people bought general-purpose PCs that came with operating 
systems that took care of the basics. Anyone could write and run software for 
an operating system, and up popped an endless assortment of application 
software.</p> 
<p>Zittrain recalls the Microsoft antitrust litigation of the 1990s but 
observes that when the iPhone came out in 2007, its design was far more 
restrictive than Windows had ever been, with no outside code at all allowed on 
the iPhone and all the included software Apple's as well. Then, in 2008, Apple 
announced a software development kit for the iPhone, under which third-party 
developers would be welcome to write software for the iPhone, pretty much as 
they'd done for Windows and Mac OS, but with the epic exception that users 
could install software on a phone only if it was offered through Apple's iPhone 
App Store, with 30% of its price siphoned off to Apple.</p> 
<p>And now the contagion is spreading to PC space with the the Mac App Store. 
Developers can't duplicate functionality already on offer in the Store and 
can't license their work as free software, because those license terms conflict 
with Apple's. Zittrain notes that even at the height of Windows' market 
dominance, Microsoft never had a role in determining what software would and 
would not run on its machines.</p> 
<p>This also has allowed censorship to gain traction. Zittrain cites the case 
Exodus International releasing an app that, among other things, inveighed 
against homosexuality, which opponents were successful in petitioning Apple to 
remove. He suggests questioning those who supported the anti-Exodus petition: 
&quot;Would you also favor a petition demanding that Apple prevent iPhone and 
iPad users from getting to Exodus' website on Safari?&quot; noting that if not, 
what's different?</p> 
<p>The upshot is that today's developers are writing code predicated on not 
just consumer acceptance, but also vendor acceptance, and he contends that both 
software developers and users should demand more, warning that if we allow 
ourselves to be lulled into satisfaction with walled gardens, we'll miss out on 
innovations to which the gardeners object, while setting ourselves up for 
censorship of code and content.</p> 
<p>Link: The Personal Computer Is Dead</p> 
<h3>Zittrain vs. Apple: What About the User Experience?</h3> 
<p>Tech.pinions' Steve Wildstrom comments that Harvard Law School Prof. 
Jonathan Zittrain (see above) doesn't like the iPhone or the iPad, or much of 
anything about the modern app economy, noting that Zittrain bemoans the loss of 
a golden age of software openness, when anyone could write and run software for 
an operating system, and up popped an endless assortment of spreadsheets, word 
processors, instant messengers, Web browsers, email, and games. In the 
dystopian future Zittrain sees, an unprecedented shift of power from end users 
and software developers to operating system vendors means the Apples, Googles, 
and Microsofts of the world will control what you can do with your PCs, phones, 
and tablets - and we'll all be the worse for it.</p> 
<p>While Wildstrom acknowledges that Zittrain is a very smart and witty guy, 
he thinks the professor is missing something very important: user experience, 
which Wildstrom characterizes as &quot;horrible&quot; back in Zittrain's glory 
days of computing freedom, observing that the many millions of people who have 
bought iPhones and iPads have chosen to cede to Apple the right to to choose 
what software their devices can run in exchange for a superior user experience.
</p> 
<p>Editor's note: That's obviously what's happening, although some of us would 
dispute that the user experience in the iOS walled garden is in fact 
qualitatively better, at least for content producers and other power users.<i>cm
</i></p> 
<p>Publisher's note: We've had third-party software since the days of the 
Apple II, and user experience has always been a big factor in which apps were 
successful and which ones failed. The down side is that open platforms also 
allow for the creation of computer viruses and other malware, a problem that 
predates personal computing.</p> 
<p>The  Creeper virus ran on DEC PDP-10 computers in 1971 and distributed 
itself over Arpanet, the predecessor to the Internet. The first PC virus 
arrived a decade later when theElk Cloner virus came to the Apple II in 1981, 
infecting the boot sector of floppy disks. The first virus for IBM compatibles 
arrived five years later, theBrain virus, which infected the boot sector of DOS 
disks. As for the Mac, only about70 viruses for the Classic Mac OS ever made it 
into the wild, and OS&nbsp;X viruses are virtually unknown, while there are 
well over 100,000 malwares aimed at Windows. Openness has its risks, but I 
think they tend to be outweighed by having a platform anyone can write for.<i>dk
</i></p> 
<p>Link: Zittrain vs. Apple: What About the User Experience?</p> 
<h3>Intel CEO: Windows 8 to Enjoy a Huge Advantage</h3> 
<p>Cnet's Larry Dignan comments that to say Intel CEO Paul Otellini is upbeat 
about the prospects for Microsoft's Windows 8 may be a bit of an 
understatement. In fact, Otellini said Windows 8 is one of the best things 
that's ever happened to Intel.</p> 
<p>Speaking at a Credit Suisse technology conference, Otellini said:</p> 
<p>&quot;We are very excited about Windows 8. I think it's one of the best 
things that's ever happened to our company. And it's a very good operating 
system, not just for PCs, but we think also will allow tablets to really get a 
legitimacy into mainstream computing, particularly in enterprises that they 
don't have today.&quot;</p> 
<p>Otellini cites Microsoft new Metro touch interface, noting that there will 
be a button that basically takes you back to the classic Windows experience - 
ergo: one operating system with two different GUIs not running on virtual 
machines, creating a huge and unique advantage for Windows 8 because it will be 
able to take advantage of legacy software as well as all the drivers for mice 
and printers and every other USB device in the world, including getting photos 
off your camera and onto a tablet.</p> 
<p>Publisher's note: Microsoft controls over 90% of the PC market (tablets 
excluded), while Intel controls 80% of the PC market and 100% of the Mac 
market. The interesting thing about Windows 8, which Intel's Otellini raves 
about, is that it will also run on ARM processors, which power almost all 
smartphones and tablets - and which Intel does not produce. Intel sold its 
Xscale ARM processor line to Marvell in 2006, although it does retain an ARM 
license, so it could get back into the ARM business if it wanted to. ARM-based 
laptops and servers are rumored for 2012, which would either dilute Intel's 
overall market share or give Intel a reason to reenter the ARM market.<i>dk</i>

<h3>Intel Core 'Ivy Bridge' Desktop CPU Launch Expected in Q2 2012</h3> 
<p>XBit Labs' Anton Shilov reports that Intel has notified partners about 
coming release of next-generation &quot;Ivy Bridge&quot; processors in Q2 2012 
- pushed back from a formerly projected March-April timeframe.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>He says reasons for the delay in releasing the world's first desktop 
microprocessors made using 22nm transistors are unclear but speculates that 
perhaps the company wants to ensure no internal competition between existing 
&quot;Sandy Bridge&quot; 2000 and future &quot;Ivy Bridge&quot; 3000 chips, or 
possibly ramp up of brand new CPUs is taking longer than expected.</p> 
<p>He also notes that the initial Ivy Bridge family will not include Core 
i3-series chips and will consist solely of Core i7 and Core i5 silicon, with an 
inexpensive Core i3 version coming later in Q2 2011.</p> 
<p>Shilov says Ivy Bridge will generally inherit Sandy Bridge 
microarchitecture, but with a significant array of improvements that will boost 
its performance in general applications by around 20% compared to Core i 
&quot;Sandy Bridge&quot; chips, as well as a new graphics core with DirectX 11 
and OpenCL 1.1 support, 30% higher performance compared to the predecessor, and 
a new video processor and display controllers, plus PCI Express 3.0 x16 
interconnection and a PCIe 2.0 x4 controller as well as a number of power 
management innovations.</p> 
<p>Publisher's note: Expect a new wave of desktop Macs when Ivy Bridge ships. 
Maybe we'll see the firstMac Pro update since July 2010! <i>dk</i></p>

<h3>How to Install Ubuntu Using VMware Fusion</h3> 
<p>MacInstruct's Matthew Cone says:</p> 
<p>&quot;Everyone is talking about Ubuntu, the popular open-source operating 
system that's easy to install and use. Trying out this Linux distribution on 
your Mac is easy. With an application called VMware Fusion, you can create a 
'computer within a computer' and run Ubuntu in a virtual machine on your Mac.

<p>&quot;Here's how to install Ubuntu 11.10 in OS X using VMware 
Fusion....&quot;</p>

<h3>Why Steve Jobs Died</h3> 
<p>The MacDougall Newsletter says:</p> 
<p>&quot;Steve Jobs gave tacit permission and encouragement for me to write 
this newsletter article about the medical and nutritional aspects of his life 
when he commissioned his biographer to tell a true account. 'I wanted my kids 
to know about me.' 'Also, when I got sick, I realized other people would write 
about me if I died, and they wouldn't know anything. They'd get it all wrong. 
So I wanted to make sure someone heard what I had to say.' Jobs would have been 
pleased to hear my challenging second opinions about his pancreatic cancer and 
his diet, because my thoughts are in agreement with what he intuitively and 
factually knew to be correct. Hopefully, my account will bring some peace of 
mind to his family and friends after his untimely death.&quot;</p> 
<p>Based on growth rate calculations for pancreatic neuro-endocrine (islet 
cell) tumors, Dr. MacDougall surmises that Jobs' cancer may have begun in his 
mid-20s, about the same time Apple was getting started, and speculates that 
lead and other carcinogens from computers caused the cancer.</p> 
<p>Editor's note: I have no idea whether this doctor's non-mainstream theories 
hold any water, so to speak, but they are fascinating for anyone interested in 
the etiology of cancer.<i>cm</i></p>

<h3>Belkin Conserve Power Switch Banishes Vampire Power Draw</h3> 
<p><b>PR:</b> Many of the electronics and appliances around your home use 
electricity even when they're not in use - wasting energy and driving up your 
electric bill. The so-called &quot;vampire power&quot; phenomenon.</p> 
<p>In a typical American household, there are up to 40 devices drawing 
constant power at a given time - even when they're not in use. This can average 
up to $100 per year in unnecessary energy costs, according to Lawrence Berkeley 
National Laboratory.</p> 
<p>Belkin's Conserve Power Switch&trade; completely shuts off power - 
including standby power - to your electronics and appliances with the flip of a 
switch, to help you save energy.</p> 
<h4>Like Unplugging - Without Unplugging</h4> 
<p>With the touch of a switch, the power shuts off. The Conserve Power Switch 
itself uses no power when not in operation, so standby power is eliminated.</p> 
<p>The Conserve Power Switch can be used with mobile phones, MP3 players, 
Bluetooth devices and digital cameras, curling irons, clothes irons, electric 
grills, coffee makers and lighting, fans, and space heaters to save energy and 
make your home safer and eliminate standby power when charging.</p> 
<p>Designed for standard US three-prong power outlets, the Conserve Power 
Switch's slim design won't obstruct an unused outlet when plugged in. Two 
Conserve Power Switches easily fit next to each other in one standard outlet 
and can work simultaneously.</p> 
<p>Conserve Power Switch Features</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Draws zero power when off</li> 
<li>Reduces clutter of unplugged devices</li> 
<li>1-Year Limited Warranty</li> </ul> 
<p>$6.99</p> 
<p>Publisher's note: It's a shame that more AC adapters don't switch to zero 
draw when not in use (the one for my old Palm Centro does that), but that's the 
reality. There's nothing automatic about Belkin's new switch, but the size and 
shape are what set it apart. This is simply a power plug with a switch that you 
have to flip, but it's less ugly than leaving a power cord or AC adapter 
unplugged on the floor or counter. (If your coffee maker has a clock, don't use 
it with one of these. It will lose track of the time, which means it won't be 
able to start automatically so you can wake up to a fresh pot in the morning. 
Other than that, good suggestions from Belkin.)<i>dk</i></p>
