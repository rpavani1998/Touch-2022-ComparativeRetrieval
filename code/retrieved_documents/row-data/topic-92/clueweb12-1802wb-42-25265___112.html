<p>Chapter 10 details the practices common to most revegetation projects. It 
is divided into 19 subchapters, called implementation guides, which summarize 
the important information needed to execute each practice.</p> 
<p>Implementation guides are grouped into four subject areas: </p> 
<ul> 
<li><b>10.1</b> Soil and Site Treatments</li> 
<li><b>10.2</b> Obtaining Plant Materials</li> 
<li><b>10.3</b> Installing Plant Materials</li> 
<li><b>10.4</b> Post Installation Care of Plant Materials</li> </ul> 
<p>The eight guides in Section 10.1, Soil and Site Treatments, explain how to 
improve site and soil conditions prior to the installation of plant materials. 
These guides cover the mitigating measures most often referenced in Chapter 5.
</p> 
<p>Section 10.2, Obtaining Plant Materials, covers six implementation guides 
that pertain to collecting and propagating plant materials. These guides 
describe how to take the species lists developed in Chapter 6 and obtain the 
desired species in the wild as seed, cuttings, or seedlings. These guides also 
cover how to increase gathered wild collections at nurseries to ensure that the 
revegetation project has sufficient quantities of plant materials.</p> 
<p>Once plant materials are obtained from the wild or from nurseries, they are 
installed on the project site. The four guides inSection 10.3, Installing Plant 
Materials, cover the techniques for sowing seed, installing cuttings, and 
planting seedlings. They also cover how to determine the quality of the plant 
materials and how to care for them during storage and transportation.</p> 
<p>Section 10.4, Post Installation Care of Plant Materials, outlines those 
practices that take place after the installation of plant materials. These 
practices help ensure that plants will become established. Practices include 
protecting seedlings from animal browsing, installing shade cards, irrigating, 
and installing tree shelters.</p> 
<h2>10.1 <b>Soil and Site Treatments</b></h2> 
<p>Most post-construction sites are in poor condition for plant growth and 
will require the implementation of mitigating measures if full or even partial 
revegetation is expected. The following set of implementation guides cover the 
common mitigating measures for improving site conditions after construction. 
The implementation guide to fertilizers,Section 10.1.1, covers how to determine 
the quantity, type, and application method of fertilizers.Tillage, Section 
10.1.2, describes the common practices of tilling the soil to improve water 
infiltration and root growing environment. Improving seed germination and 
reducing surface erosion can be accomplished through the application of 
mulches, which is detailed inSection 10.1.3, Mulches.</p> 
<p>Section 10.1.4, Topsoil, outlines the removal, storage, and application of 
topsoil to reconstruct soil on highly disturbed sites. For sites where topsoil 
is not available or in short supply, organic matter can be applied to improve 
post-construction soils.Section 10.1.5, Organic Matter Amendments, discusses 
the types of organic matter available, how to determine rates, and how it is 
applied. On some sites where the topsoil has been removed, pH levels will need 
to be raised to improve plant growth.Section 10.1.6, Lime Amendments, details 
the methods for determining liming rates, materials, and application methods. 
Many sites devoid of topsoil will require the introduction of mycorrhizae or 
nitrogen fixing plants.Section 10.1.7, Beneficial Soil Microorganisms, covers 
how to obtain and apply the appropriate sources of these important biological 
organisms. Revegetation projects can be enhanced by integrating plants into 
bioengineering structures, water capture features, or planting islands or 
pockets. These are discussed inSection 10.1.8, Topographic Enhancements.</p> 
<h3>10.1.1 Fertilizers &mdash; Spot-Fertilizing Seedlings</h3> 
<h4>10.1.1.1 Introduction</h4> 
<p>Fertilizers are used to bring soil nutrients up to levels essential for 
establishing and maintaining a desired plant community. When applied within a 
soil fertility strategy, using fertilizer can be a great tool for revegetation. 
In recent years, however, the use of fertilizers on roadsides has come under 
greater public scrutiny and more restrictive water quality laws. Many roads are 
adjacent to streams, lakes, or residential areas which can be affected by 
runoff or leaching of inappropriately applied fertilizers. It is important for 
the revegetation specialist to learn how to develop fertilizer prescriptions 
that integrate short- and long-term site fertility goals with water quality 
objectives.</p> 
<p>Use of commercial fertilizer is only one of many options to increase 
nutrient levels. A soil fertility strategy should also consider the application 
of topsoil, mulch, compost, wood waste, biosolids, and/or the planting of 
nitrogen-fixing species. This section will guide the revegetation specialist 
through the steps necessary to develop a site specific fertilizer prescription. 
The process for developing a fertilizer prescription follows these steps:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Determine nutrient thresholds and deficits,</li> 
<li>Delineate areas to be fertilized,</li> 
<li>Select fertilizer analysis,</li> 
<li>Select fertilizer release rates,</li> 
<li>Determine application rates,</li> 
<li>Determine timing and frequency, and</li> 
<li>Select application method.</li> </ul> 
<p>The fertilizer prescription is the basic instructions for ordering and 
applying fertilizers.</p> 
<h4>10.1.1.2 Develop Nutrient Thresholds and Determine Deficits</h4> 
<p>All sites have a minimum, or threshold, level of nutrients that must be met 
for each plant community to become functioning and self-sustaining (SeeSection 
5.5). Threshold values can be determined by comparing soil tests from several 
disturbed and undisturbed reference sites (SeeChapter 4). Disturbed reference 
sites should range from poor success to good. Based on nutrient values from 
good and poor revegetation sites, a target can be estimated between these 
values. Figure 10.1 gives an example of how a nitrogen threshold value was 
obtained by evaluating the total soil nitrogen levels from two disturbed 
reference sites, one considered &quot;fair&quot; revegetation and one 
considered &quot;poor.&quot; The threshold was set between these two nitrogen 
levels. Threshold levels represent the minimum level of nutrients needed for a 
site. However, higher nutrient levels are more desirable. In fact, the target 
nitrogen levels in this example for establishing and maintaining the original 
plant community would be closer to the undisturbed reference site.</p> 
<p><b>Figure 10.1 &mdash;</b> Threshold values are determined from reference 
sites. In this example, the threshold was established at 1,100 lb/ac, which was 
between the total N of a disturbed reference site with &quot;poor&quot; 
revegetation (A) and one with &quot;fair&quot; revegetation (B). Total N in 
post-construction soils was 650 lb/ac (C), making these soils deficient by 450 
lb/ac. The undisturbed topsoil of reference sites showed a total N of 2,430 
lb/ac (D), which sets the target levels of nitrogen between 1,100 and 2,430 
lb/ac.</p>

<p><b>Figure 10.2 &mdash;</b> Determining the amount of nitrogen (N) needed to 
bring soils up to a nitrogen threshold can be calculated from equations shown 
in this spreadsheet.</p> 
<p>To determine whether any nutrient is deficient, post-construction soils 
must be collected and tested. The values obtained from these tests are compared 
against target values to determine if a deficiency exists. By comparing 
post-construction nutrient values against threshold values, the nutrient 
deficit can be estimated for each nutrient. Figure 10.2 shows an example of how 
nitrogen deficits are calculated based on post-construction soil tests and 
established threshold levels. In this example, total soil nitrogen is 
determined from soil tests. Since soil testing facilities report nutrients in a 
variety of rates, it is important to convert the rates to percentages. This is 
done by dividing values that come as gr/l, ppm, mg/kg, and ug/g by 10,000 to 
convert to a percentage. Converting percentage of nutrient in the lab sample to 
lb/ac of the nutrient requires multiplying % of nutrient, soil layer thickness, 
soil bulk density, and fine soil fraction together with a constant (line D). 
This is the pounds of nutrient in an acre of soil on the post-construction 
site. To determine the nutrient deficit, the pounds of nutrients per acre is 
subtracted from the threshold level. This value becomes the basis for 
determining fertilizer prescriptions.</p> 
<p>The availability of many nutrients is regulated by soil pH. As discussed in 
Section 5.5.5, many nutrients are tied up in low pH and high pH soils. Calcium 
and magnesium are less available at low pH; phosphorus, iron, manganese, boron, 
zinc and copper become unavailable in high pH soils. It is important to compare 
the pH of post-construction soils with reference site soils to determine if the 
pH is substantially different between the two. If the pH of post-construction 
soils is different, then taking measures to bring the pH closer to 
pre-disturbance values should be considered when developing a nutrient strategy 
(SeeSections 5.5.5.3, 5.5.5.4, 10.1.5, and 10.1.6). </p> 
<h4>10.1.1.3 Delineate Areas to be Fertilized</h4> 
<p>The post-construction project site should be delineated by distinct areas 
where fertilizer prescriptions differ. These differences are usually based on 
post-construction soil type changes, topsoil salvage, organic amendment 
additions, or the species and plant material being grown. Areas adjacent to, or 
that feed into, live water are often delineated and treated with lower rates of 
fertilizer. Note: If seedlings of shrubs and trees are being planted, spot 
fertilization should be considered in addition to, or in lieu of, fertilizing 
the entire area (See Inset 10.1, Spot-Fertilizing Seedlings).</p> 
<p><b>Figure 10.3 &mdash;</b> An example of a fertilizer label for an 
&quot;all purpose&quot; fertilizer. The top numbers (in bold) represent the 
percentage of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium respectively (21%N, 5% P2O5, 
and 20% K2O). Multiplying these percentages by the pounds of bulk fertilizer 
applied per acre will give the quantity of each nutrient applied per acre. In 
this analysis, 500 pounds of fertilizer in this analysis would deliver 105 lbs 
N, 25 lbs P2O5 ,100 lb K2O, 0.1 lbs B, 0.05 lbs Cu, and so on.</p> 
<h4>10.1.1.4 Select Fertilizer Analysis</h4> 
<p>There are a variety of commercially available fertilizers that can be used 
for fertilizing disturbed sites associated with road construction. The 
composition, or makeup, of the fertilizer is called the fertilizer analysis. 
Each container of fertilizer will have a label with a stated &quot;guaranteed 
analysis&quot; that indicates the percentage of each nutrient contained in the 
fertilizer (Figure 10.3). The label is your guide for determining which 
fertilizers to select and how much to apply. Tables 10.1 and 10.2 give analysis 
values for many common fertilizers. Labels can also be obtained from the 
manufacturer or fertilizer representatives.</p> 
<p>The fertilizer label reports the nutrients as a percentage. The example 
label for a 50 lb bag of fertilizer in Figure 10.3 shows 21% nitrogen (N), 
which indicates that 10.5 lb of material in the bag is made up of nitrogen (50 
* 21/100=10.5). The bag also contains 0.02 % boron (B), which indicates that 
there is 0.01 lb boron in the bag. Calculating the amount of phosphorous and 
potassium in the bag is a little trickier because the convention for reporting 
these nutrients is P2O5 and K2O instead of elemental P and K. To convert P2O5 
to P, the analysis for P is divided by 2.29. The percentage of P in the bag in 
Figure 10.3 is actually 2.2%, not 5% (5.0%/2.29=2.2). K2O is divided by 1.21 to 
obtain 1.6% K.</p> 
<p>Fertilizers are selected based on whether they contain the nutrients that 
are deficient on the project site. For example, if nitrogen, phosphorus, and 
boron are deficient, only fertilizers that contain these nutrients need be 
considered. Most fertilizers contain more than one nutrient. For instance, 
ammonium sulfate contains nitrogen and sulfur; triple superphosphate contains 
phosphorus, sulfur and calcium. Organic fertilizers often contain a range of 
macro and micronutrients. Fertilizers containing more than one nutrient should 
be considered if the nutrients contained in these fertilizers are deficient in 
post-construction soils. Table 10.1 and Table 10.2 show the combination of 
nutrients that are available in some commercially available fertilizers.</p> 
<p>Fertilizer selection should focus first on the macronutrients (nitrogen, 
potassium, and phosphorus) that are deficient. These three nutrients are 
considered most important for long-term site recovery. If they are not 
deficient, chances are that the remaining nutrients are not either. On most 
highly disturbed sites, nitrogen is most likely to be deficient. This nutrient 
should be considered first when approaching fertilizer selection. Table 10.2 
lists common nitrogen fertilizers with typical label analysis. Nutrients other 
than nitrogen can be supplied by fertilizers shown in Table 10.1. It is common 
to apply more than one fertilizer to meet the various nutrient requirements of 
the soil.</p> 
<h4>10.1.1.5 Select Fertilizer Release Rates</h4> 
<p>Fertilizers are grouped by how quickly they break down and release 
nutrients to the soil. They are either fast-release or slow-release. Release 
rates are important because they will determine the rates at which nutrients 
become available to plants during the year. If nutrients are released during 
periods when vegetation cannot use them, some will be lost from the site 
through soil leaching. This is not only a waste of fertilizer, but can be 
source of ground water pollution.</p> 
<p>Fast-Release Fertilizers &mdash; Fast-release fertilizers are highly 
soluble fertilizer salts that dissolve rapidly and move quickly into the soil 
during rainstorms or snowmelt. The fertilizer label will give an indication of 
how quickly nutrients are released. Terms such as &quot;soluble,&quot; 
&quot;available,&quot; or &quot;water soluble&quot; indicate that these 
nutrients are released relatively quickly. &quot;Ammonium&quot; and 
&quot;nitrate&quot; forms of nitrogen are also indications of fast-release 
fertilizers. The fertilizer label shown in Figure 10.3 would indicate that this 
bag contains a fast-release fertilizer and most of the nitrogen would be 
relatively mobile and available to plant growth within the first growing 
season. Ammonium nitrate, ammonium sulfate, potassium nitrate, and urea are 
several examples of fast-release fertilizers.</p> 
<p><b>Table 10.1 &mdash; </b>Analysis of some common fertilizers. Nitrogen 
fertilizers are shown in Table 10.2.</p> 
<p><b>Table 10.2 &mdash; </b>This table gives estimated nitrogen release rates 
for some commercially available fertilizers. Most release rates were obtained 
from lab testing. How they actually release on-site will vary from site to 
site, depending on temperature, moisture, and whether the fertilizer was placed 
on the surface or incorporated into the soil. If slow-release fertilizers are 
broadcast on the soil surface, release rates should be slower than if 
incorporated into the soil where the conditions are better for break down. Arid 
sites should have slower rates of release than sites with high moisture; cold 
sites should take longer to release nutrients than warm sites. First year 
nitrogen release rates for fertilizers are identified with an asterisk were 
adapted from Claassen and Hogan (1998). Non-asterisk fertilizers were based on 
best guess estimates.</p> 
<p>&quot;Water soluble&quot; or &quot;available&quot; nutrients do not always 
remain available or soluble after they are applied to the soil. Available forms 
of phosphorus, for instance, react in the soil to form less soluble compounds; 
potassium gets bound up in soils with moderate to high proportions of clay; and 
many of the micronutrients (e.g., zinc, copper, manganese) become unavailable 
when applied to soils with low pH (SeeSection 5.5.5). Unless soils are sandy or 
rocky, it can be assumed that many of the nutrients stated as 
&quot;available,&quot; except for nitrogen and sulfur, will become somewhat 
immobile once they are applied. Over time, however, these nutrients will become 
available for plant uptake.</p> 
<p>The advantages of fast-release fertilizers are they are relatively 
inexpensive, easy to handle, immediately available to the plant, and can be 
applied through a range of fertilizer spreading equipment. Disadvantages are 
that some nutrients, such as nitrogen, will leach through the soil profile if 
they are not first taken up by plants or captured by soil microorganisms in the 
break down of carbon. Nitrates from fast-release fertilizers have been found to 
leach through sandy soils to depths that are 4 times the rate of rainfall 
(Dancer 1975). For example, for sites with annual rainfalls of 12 inches, 
nitrate could move to a depth of four feet if it was not taken up by plants or 
soil organisms. At this depth, nitrogen would be out of range of most 
establishing root systems.</p> 
<p>Since fast-release fertilizers are salts, they have a potential to burn 
foliage and roots, especially when fertilizers are applied at high 
concentrations or when applied during dry weather (SeeSection 5.5.5.2). High 
concentrations of fast-release fertilizers can also affect germination rates 
(Figure 10.4) because of the high soluble salt levels (Brooks and Blaser 1964; 
Carr and Ballard 1979). Salt damage can be reduced by mixing fast-release 
fertilizers at lower concentrations or by applying them during rainy weather.
</p> 
<p><b>Figure 10.4 &mdash; </b>Germination of seeds for some species can be 
reduced following exposure to a 10-30-10 fertilizer solution at a rate of 750 
lbs fertilizer per 1,000 gallon hydroseeder (after Carr and Ballard 1979).</p> 
<p>Slow-Release Fertilizers &mdash; These fertilizers are designed to release 
nutrients at a much slower rate. To be labeled slow-release fertilizer, some 
states require a specific amount of nitrogen to be in a slow-release form. 
Forms of nitrogen shown on the label as &quot;slowly-available&quot; or 
&quot;water-insoluble&quot; are good indicators that a fertilizer is in a 
slow-release form. The advantages of using slow-release fertilizers are: 1) 
nutrients are supplied at a time when plants are potentially growing; 2) less 
frequent applications; 3) less potential for leaching into ground water; and 4) 
less potential to cause salt injury. The disadvantages are that many 
slow-release fertilizers are bulky, cost more to purchase and apply, and are 
limited by the type of fertilizer application equipment that can be used. On 
the whole, however, slow-release fertilizers have greater applicability for 
revegetating disturbed sites than fast-release fertilizers.</p> 
<p>Slow-release fertilizers come in either organic or inorganic forms. Organic 
fertilizers include animal manures (including chicken, steer, cow), bone meal, 
fish emulsion, composted sewage sludge, and yard waste. Unprocessed organic 
fertilizers are hard to apply to roadside projects because they are bulky and 
high in moisture. Commercially available organic fertilizers, such as 
Fertil-FiberT and Biosol&reg;, have been processed to remove most moisture, 
which makes them easier to apply through most fertilizer spreading equipment.
</p> 
<p>The agents responsible for release of nutrients from organic fertilizers 
are decomposing soil bacteria. When soil bacteria are active, the release of 
nutrients is high; when dormant, the rate is low. The release of nutrients is 
therefore a function of moisture and temperature, which governs the rate of 
bacterial growth. Warm temperatures and high moisture, conditions conducive to 
plant growth, are also favorable for the break down of organic fertilizers. 
Because of this, the release of nutrients from the decomposition of organic 
fertilizers often coincides with the period when plants are growing (spring and 
fall) and the need for nutrients is greatest. The nutrient release mechanism of 
slow-release organic fertilizers reduces the risk that highly mobile nutrients, 
such as nitrogen, will be released in the winter months when plants are 
incapable of absorbing them and the potential for leaching is greatest.</p> 
<p>Inorganic forms of slow-release fertilizers were developed for the 
horticulture and landscape industries where they have become an effective 
method of fertilizing nursery plants. These are an expensive form of fertilizer 
and have not been tested on roadside revegetation conditions. Nevertheless, 
they should not be overlooked in their potential applicability for some native 
revegetation projects.</p> 
<p><b>Figure 10.5 &mdash;</b> An example of calculating fertilizer application 
rates to reduce nitrogen deficits.</p> 
<p>Inorganic slow-release fertilizers include ureaform, nitroform, IBDU 
(isobutylidene diurea), sulfur-coated urea, and polymer-coated nitrogen, 
phosphorus, and potassium. These fertilizers have varying mechanisms for 
nutrient release. Fertilizer granules coated with materials that release 
nutrients only during warm, moist conditions assure that nutrients are 
available during the period that plants are most likely to be growing. These 
coatings include sulfur (e.g., sulfur-coated urea) and polymers. Each 
fertilizer has its own formulated nutrient release rate, which varies from 3 
months to 18 months. Release rates are available from the manufacturers for 
most inorganic, slow-release fertilizers. However, it should be noted that 
these rates were developed for 70 &deg;F soil temperatures (Rose 2002), which 
are higher than soil temperatures in the western United States during the 
spring and fall when roots and foliage are growing. If roadside soils are 
colder than 70 &deg;F, nutrient release will take longer than what the 
manufacturer states.</p> 
<h4>10.1.1.6 Determine Fertilizer Application Rates</h4> 
<p>Fertilizer rates are determined for each deficient nutrient as shown in 
Figure 10.5. The calculation in this example was done to eliminate a nitrogen 
deficit of 769 lb/ac. Using a slow-release fertilizer with 8% nitrogen, the 
amount of bulk fertilizer necessary to bring nitrogen levels to minimum targets 
is 9,613 lb/ac (769*100/8=9,613), which is an extremely high rate of fertilizer 
to apply. On the other hand, using a fast-release fertilizer with higher 
nitrogen analysis, such as ammonium nitrate (33% N), would reduce the amount of 
bulk fertilizer to 2,330 lb (769*100/33 = 2,330). While there would be less 
weight with this more concentrated fertilizer, this is considered a dangerous 
rate of fertilizer to apply. It would be risky and wasteful considering the 
potential for leaching high amounts of nitrate through soil into the ground 
water or the possibility of creating high salt levels toxic to plant growth. 
This example illustrates the difficulty in developing fertilizer prescriptions 
to meet long-term nutrient targets. How does the revegetation specialist 
develop a fertilizer strategy to meet short-term and long-term plant needs 
without over- or under-fertilizing?</p> 
<p>The approach presented in this section is based on building long-term 
nutrient objectives around meeting short-term nutrient needs of the 
establishing plant community. For example, applying fertilizer at the time of 
sowing requires very low rates of available nitrogen to meet the first year 
needs of the establishing vegetation. Any extra fertilizer has the potential of 
being wasted. As the vegetation develops over the next few years, the ability 
of the plant community to take up more available nutrients increases and the 
fertilizer rates would be gradually increased. This practice, however, is 
seldom employed in roadside revegetation projects. In fact, the typical 
fertilizer practice does just the opposite &mdash; high rates of fertilizers 
are put on with seeds before there are even plants to utilize the available 
nutrients. In this practice, there is no return to the site in later years to 
assess whether additional applications of fertilizers might be essential for 
vegetation maintenance or growth. The approach we advocate is applying the 
appropriate mix of fertilizers to meet the annual needs of the vegetation while 
building long-term nutrient capital until the plant community is 
self-sustaining.</p> 
<p>Since nitrogen is the key nutrient in establishing plant communities, this 
approach requires setting short-term and long-term nitrogen requirements of the 
plant community being established. Calculating long-term nitrogen targets is 
covered inSection 10.1.1.2. Short-term targets are more difficult to set 
because they change over time. They are governed by:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Soil type,</li> 
<li>C:N,</li> 
<li>Climate,</li> 
<li>Amount of vegetative cover,</li> 
<li>Type of vegetation, and</li> 
<li>Age of vegetation.</li> </ul> 
<p>Some general guides can be helpful in setting short-term nutrient targets 
for available nitrogen. Applying fertilizer at the time of sowing, for 
instance, will require very low rates of available nitrogen the first year 
since vegetation will not be established well enough to utilize it. Rates can 
be set below 25 lb/ac when applying fertilizer with seeds. When vegetation is 
becoming established, available N can range from 25 to 50 lb/ac (Munshower 
1994: Claassen and Hogan 1998). After plant establishment, rates can be 
increased to account for increased plant utilization above this amount. These 
suggested rates should be adjusted upward on sites where high C:N soil 
amendments, such as shredded wood or straw, have been incorporated into the 
soil to compensate for nitrogen tie-up. Calculating precise rates of 
supplemental nitrogen for incorporated organic amendments is very difficult. In 
nursery settings, rates of over 100 lb of supplemental nitrogen have been 
recommended for incorporated straw, sawdust, and other high C:N materials (Rose 
and others 1995). However, applying supplemental rates in wildland settings 
should be done with caution, utilizing trials where possible to determine more 
precise fertilizer rates. Utilizing periodic soil analysis can give the 
revegetation specialist a better understanding of the soil nitrogen status. To 
keep testing costs low, only available nitrogen and total nitrogen need to be 
tested (SeeSection 5.5 for soil sampling and testing methods).</p> 
<p>In determining how much fertilizer to apply, it is important to estimate 
how much nitrogen will be available the first year and the second year. 
Manufacturers have this information for most inorganic slow release 
fertilizers, and Claassen and Hogan (1998) performed tests on organic slow 
release fertilizers (shown in Figure 10.2). Release rate determinations are 
performed in the laboratory. How fertilizers actually release in the field will 
vary by the environment. In the example described in Figure 10.5, the first 
year release rate of nitrogen from the slow-release organic fertilizer was 
estimated at 40%. This was a guess based on the manufacturer's estimates of 55% 
release, but because it was being applied to a semi-arid site where 
decomposition of the fertilizer would be slow, the rate was dropped to 40% 
(Line D in 10.5). If 40% of the nitrogen became available the first year, 60% 
would remain for the following years (Line E). At this release rate, 308 lb/ac 
of nitrogen would become available the first year after application (Line F). 
While this is an extremely high rate, consider the application of ammonium 
nitrate at 100% first year release, which would supply 769 lb/ac (Line A) of 
immediately available nitrogen. Recalculating fertilizer rates using a more 
realistic rate of 50 lb/ac available nitrogen needed the first year after 
application (Line F), bulk fertilizer application rates would be 1,563 lb/ac 
(Line H). At this new rate, the site would have sufficient first- and 
second-year supplies of nitrogen, but lack adequate nitrogen the following 
years. The remaining deficit to meet long-term nitrogen targets would be 
approximately 644 lb/ac, which must be supplied through later applications of 
fertilizer or other carriers of nitrogen (topsoil, compost, biosolids, wood 
waste, mulch, and nitrogen-fixing plants). A nutrient strategy should be built 
around reducing nitrogen deficits over time.</p> 
<p>The process outlined in Figure 10.5 can be used for other deficient 
nutrients. Understanding the availability of other nutrients is problematic. 
Many nutrients become fixed in the soils and their availability is dependent on 
highly variable factors such as soil texture, pH, and placement in the soil. It 
is a reasonable assumption that unless the soils are sandy or very rocky, that 
all nutrients, aside from nitrate or ammonium forms of nitrogen, are relatively 
unavailable the first year after application. With time, however, they will 
slowly become available.</p> 
<h4>10.1.1.7 Determine Timing and Frequency</h4> 
<p>The primary reason to fertilize is to supply nutrients during periods when 
plants can take them up for growth. The demand for nutrients changes throughout 
the year depending on the physiological state of each plant. In nursery 
settings, fertilizers are adjusted throughout the year at rates and 
formulations that correspond to the requirements of the plant. While we do not 
have that capability in wildland settings, we can use the fertilizers available 
to us more wisely by applying our understanding of how the assortment of 
fertilizers function in meeting the nutrient requirements of plant communities. 
At least two plant growth phases should be considered in the timing of 
fertilizer application &mdash; 1) seed germination, and plant establishment and 
2) post plant establishment.</p> 
<p>Seed Germination and Plant Establishment Phase &mdash; Traditionally, 
fast-release fertilizers have often been applied at high rates in the fall 
during the seed sowing operation. This practice is a quick and easy way to 
apply fertilizers. However, the timing can result in ineffective and wasteful 
use of fertilizers (Figure 10.6B) (Dancer 1975). In addition, application of 
fast-release fertilizers at this time can potentially pollute water sources. 
Slow-release fertilizers are more appropriate for seed sowing in the fall 
because much of the fertilizer should last through the winter, releasing 
nutrients in the spring (Figure 10.6D).</p> 
<p>Perennial grasses and forbs do not require high levels of nitrogen for 
germination and early establishment (Reeder and Sabey 1987). In fact, elevated 
levels of available nitrogen can be a problem because it encourages the rapid 
establishment and growth of annual weed species over slower-growing perennial 
grass and forbs (McLendon and Redente 1992; Claassen and Marler 1998). Applying 
high rates of fertilizers during germination and early seedling establishment 
should be reconsidered in terms of how much fertilizer is actually needed in 
the establishment phase and how much will be available later for plant growth 
(SeeSection 10.1.1.6). </p> 
<p>One strategy is to apply little or no fertilizer during sowing and wait 
until seeds have germinated and grown into small seedlings before fertilizers 
are applied (Figure 10.6C). This strategy assures that nutrients are available 
when the seedlings actually need them, not before. Fertilizers applied as 
slow-release form are preferred because they have less potential for causing 
salt damage when applied over emerging seedlings. Another strategy is to wait 
until the following fall (Figure 10.6E) or spring (Figure 10.6F) of the second 
year to fertilize.</p> 
<p>Post-Establishment &mdash; Once vegetation is established (one or two years 
after sowing), fertilizers can be applied at higher rates with the assurance 
that nutrients will be taken up by the plants. Slow- and fast-release 
fertilizers can be combined to provide short- and long-term nutrient 
requirements (Figure 10.6 E and F). Spring applications of fast-release 
fertilizers are more effective than fall application because of the higher 
nutrient requirements of growing plants during that period (Figure 10.6F). 
Spring applications also have less risk of damaging vegetation through 
fertilizer salts because precipitation in the spring is typically frequent 
enough to wash fertilizers from the foliage. It is always prudent to check the 
conductivity of a fertilizer solution being applied over existing vegetation to 
avoid salt damage. A conductivity meter can be used to measure the conductivity 
of the solution (SeeSection 5.5.5). If rates exceed 3,500 mS/cm, then diluting 
the solution or applying the fertilizer during rainy weather is advised. Fall 
application of fertilizers should be done at lower rates and early enough for 
nutrients to be utilized by the growing vegetation. Fertilizer rates can be 
adjusted based on plant phenology or dormancy to minimize salt damage. 
Fertilizing dormant plants is also a possible way to minimize damage.</p> 
<h4>10.1.1.8 Select Fertilizer Application Method</h4> 
<p>Since nutrients have varying degrees of mobility (nitrogen is highly 
mobile; phosphorus and many micronutrients are relatively immobile), how 
fertilizers are applied will determine how accessible nutrients are to the root 
system. If nutrients are highly mobile, the easiest and least expensive method 
is to apply fertilizer to the soil surface, or broadcast, to allow rainfall or 
snowmelt to release and move nutrients into the soil. A more difficult, yet 
more effective application method for immobile nutrients is to incorporate, or 
mix, fertilizers into the soil surface so fertilizer granules are uniformly 
distributed within the soil and accessible by root systems.</p> 
<p>Broadcast Fertilizer Application &mdash; For fertilizers with highly mobile 
nutrients, such as nitrogen and sulfur, broadcast application on the soil 
surface is an appropriate practice. For immobile nutrients, broadcast 
fertilizer application can be relatively ineffective. These nutrients often 
become immobilized at the soil surface and are very slow to move into the 
rooting zone where they can be accessed. Depending on soil characteristics, 
such as pH and clay content, some immobile nutrients will take years to move 
only a few inches from the point of fertilizer placement.</p> 
<p>There are a variety of dry fertilizer spreaders available, from 
hand-operated to tractor-mounted. Most equipment is limited to moderate slope 
gradients (less than 1V:2H). With all forms of spreaders, they must be 
calibrated before they are used to assure that the correct rates are being 
applied.</p> 
<p>Hydroseeding equipment can be used to apply fertilizer in the same 
operation with seeds, tackifiers, and hydromulch (SeeSection 10.3.2, 
Hydroseeding). This equipment can also be used solely to apply fertilizers, 
especially after vegetation has become established. A great advantage to using 
hydroseeding equipment is that it can uniformly spread fertilizers on steep 
slopes and a variety of topographies. In addition, a combination of fertilizers 
can be easily mixed in the hydroseed tank and applied at relatively even 
proportions because they are in a solution. This is especially useful for 
applying small quantities of fertilizer, such as micronutrients, which are 
difficult to spread evenly over large areas.</p> A. <em>When seeding occurs in 
the fall, seeds typically do not germinate until the following spring, at which 
time there is rapid growth. During the summer, growth rates slow. Growth rates 
accelerate again in the fall.</em> 
<p>B. <em>When fast-release fertilizers (dashed line) are applied in the fall 
during seeding, fertilizers move into the soil with fall rains. However, there 
is no vegetation to take up the nutrients. Mobile nutrients, such as nitrogen, 
are leached and unavailable in the spring when the establishing plants require 
them.</em></p> <br>
C. <em>Fast-release fertilizer applied in the spring after 
plants are established is more effective because plants are rapidly growing and 
can take up nutrients. There are fewer storms in the spring to leach nutrients 
from the soil.</em> 
<p>D. <em>Slow-release fertilizers (dotted line) release nutrients at a much 
slower rate. When they are applied in the fall, most of the nutrients should 
still be available in the following spring.</em></p> <br>

<p>E.<em> Once vegetation has become established, plant growth will take place 
in the fall. Fertilizers applied at this time will be taken up by growing 
vegetation. Since slow-release fertilizers might not be immediately available, 
small amounts of fast-release fertilizers can be added to give immediate 
release of nutrients.</em></p> 
<p>F.<em> Slow- and fast-release fertilizers can be applied in the early 
spring before rapid root and vegetative growth. Fast-release fertilizers can 
supplement slow-release fertilizers by supplying immediately available 
nutrients.</em></p> <br>
<br>

<p><b>Figure 10.6 &mdash;</b> Fertilizers should be applied during seasons, 
and at rates and formulations that release nutrients when native plants can 
efficiently draw them from the soil. The following are strategies for applying 
slow and fast release fertilizers.</p> 
<p><b>Inset 10.1 &mdash; Spot-Fertilizing Seedlings</b></p> 
<p>Fertilizing shrub or tree seedlings is done by placing fertilizer in each 
seedling hole or on the soil surface after each seedling has been planted. This 
practice has some risks, because fertilizers release salts which can damage 
roots. Studies have shown that placing fertilizers or liming materials in the 
planting hole or on the soil surface around seedlings at the time of planting 
can significantly decrease seedling survival, especially on droughty sites 
(Nursery Technical Cooperative 2004; Jacobs and others 2004; Walker 2002).</p> 
<p>To reduce the likelihood of seedling damage, follow these practices:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Assess the need for fertilizer (do not apply if nutrient levels are 
adequate).</li> 
<li>Use slow release fertilizers with low salt indexes.</li> 
<li>Use low rates of fertilizer if applying at the time of planting.</li> 
<li>If applying in seedling hole at planting, use low fertilizer rates and 
place fertilizer to the side at least 3 inches away from the root system.</li> 
<li>Preferably broadcast fertilizers on the soil surface after seedlings are 
well established.</li> </ul> 
<p>When slow-release fertilizers are spread around well-established seedlings 
(several years after planting), seedlings often respond favorably, especially 
on highly disturbed sites. Walker (2005) showed that slow-release fertilizers 
broadcasted three years after seedlings were planted, increased stem diameter 
and shoot volume over the control seedlings by 143% and 104% respectively five 
years after the fertilizer was applied. In this study, rates of .05 grams of 
nitrogen per seedling showed the greatest response (at 8% nitrogen analysis, 
this would be over a half pound of bulk slow-release fertilizer per plant).</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> <br>
<br>

<p>Fertilizer Incorporation &mdash; It is important that nutrients that are 
deficient and have low mobility be incorporated into the soil prior to sowing 
or planting. Incorporation is possible on gentle slopes, but becomes very 
difficult with increasing slope gradients because of equipment limitations. On 
sites where fertilizers containing immobile nutrients cannot be incorporated, 
an alternative is to create roughened soil surfaces (SeeSection 10.1.2, Tillage
) prior to fertilizer application. Broadcast fertilizers will accumulate in the 
depressions of the surface. As soil gradually moves into the depressions over 
time (through water erosion or surface ravel), the broadcast fertilizers will 
become covered with soil. When this happens, immobile nutrients are accessible 
by roots and nutrient uptake is possible. Surface roughening also reduces the 
potential for fertilizers to move off-slope through erosion.</p> 
<p>Some agricultural spreaders, called fertilizer banders or injectors, are 
designed to place fertilizer, or other soil amendments including mycorrhizae, 
at varying depths in the soil. Usually this equipment has a ripping shank or 
tine that loosens the soil, followed by a tube that drops the fertilizer, and 
coulters or rollers that close up the furrow. As the bander is pulled through 
the soil, a line, or band, of fertilizer is created. Sowing and banding are 
often combined in one piece of equipment and applied at the same time. 
Fertilizer banders were developed for agricultural use and are limited by rock 
content and slope gradients. However, there are injectors that have been 
develop for wildland conditions (St John 1995).</p> 
<p>The most common approach to incorporating fertilizer is accomplished in two 
operations, broadcasting fertilizer on the soil surface and tilling it into the 
soil. Hydroseeders and broadcast fertilizer spreaders, as discussed above, are 
means of applying the fertilizer evenly over the site, then the fertilizer is 
tilled into the soil using equipment outlined inSection 10.1.2, Tillage. </p> 
<p>Back to Top</p> 
<h3>10.1.2 Tillage</h3> 
<h4>10.1.2.1 Introduction</h4> 
<p>Tillage is defined in this section as any mechanical action applied to the 
soil for the purposes of long-term control of soil erosion and reestablishment 
of native plant communities. Tillage equipment was developed for agricultural 
soils and has limited applicability for steep, rocky sites typically 
encountered in wildland revegetation. This section will discuss the 
agricultural equipment that can be used for wildland revegetation as well as 
equipment specifically developed for these extreme conditions.</p> 
<p>There are several reasons to use tillage in a revegetation project, 
including to:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Shatter compacted soils,</li> 
<li>Incorporate soil amendments, and</li> 
<li>Roughen soil surfaces.</li> </ul> 
<p>These objectives often overlap. For example, incorporating organic matter 
also loosens compacted soils and roughens soil surfaces. Identifying the 
objectives for the project will lead to selecting and effectively using the 
appropriate equipment to achieve the desired soil conditions (Table 10.3).</p> 
<h4>10.1.2.2 Shatter Compacted Soils</h4> 
<p>One of the primary purposes for tilling is to loosen compacted soils. When 
performed correctly, tillage can increase porosity in the rooting zone, 
increase infiltration rates, and increase surface roughness. For revegetation 
work associated with road construction and road obliteration, tillage to break 
up deep compaction is important for reestablishing plant communities. 
Shattering compaction at depths of at least 2 feet is essential for the healthy 
growth of most perennial plant species. Without this measure, it will take many 
decades for deep compaction to recover its original bulk density (Wert and 
Thomas 1981; Froehlich and others 1983). In a review of tillage projects on 
rangeland soils, Gifford (1975) found that deep tillage greatly reduced runoff, 
while shallow tillage had little effect.</p> 
<p>Tillage alone will not return a soil to its original bulk density or 
hydrologic function (Figure 10.7), nor will the effects of tillage last 
indefinitely, especially in non-cohesive soils (Onstad and others 1984). There 
are many factors that affect the return to bulk densities and infiltration 
rates typical of undisturbed reference sites. These include the type of tillage 
equipment used, penetration depth, soil moisture during tillage, soil texture, 
presence of topsoil, and organic matter content.</p> 
<p>There are two fundamentally different equipment designs for reducing 
compaction. One design simply lifts and drops soil in place, shattering 
compacted soil in the process. This type of equipment includes rock rippers, 
subsoilers, and &quot;winged&quot; subsoilers. The second design churns and 
mixes the soil. Equipment that falls into this category includes disk harrows, 
plows, spaders, and attachments to excavators. This type of equipment can also 
incorporate soil amendments, like organic matter or fertilizers, in the same 
operation, and will be discussed inSection 10.1.2.3.</p> 
<p><b>Table 10.3 &mdash; </b>The appropriate tillage equipment for the project 
depends on project objectives.</p> 
<p><b>Figure 10.7 &mdash;</b> Short-term benefits of ripping (using a winged 
subsoiler) and mulching road surfaces vary by soil type, as shown in rainfall 
simulation tests on sites in northern Idaho. Granitic soils responded to 
ripping and mulching with increased permeability during the first storm, but 
permeability rates returned to near pre-treatments rates with successive 
rainfall events. Metamorphic soils reacted positively to both treatments and 
maintained high permeability rates after three rainfall events. Mulching 
improved permeability in both soil types. In fact, for metamorphic soils, the 
combination of ripping and mulching increased permeability to rates that were 
typical of lightly disturbed forest soils (adapted from Luce 1997).</p> 
<p><b>Figure 10.8 &mdash; </b>Soil shattering becomes more effective when 
wings are mounted on subsoil tines. This equipment is called a winged 
subsoiler. Photo courtesy Brent Roath.</p> 
<p>The terms subsoiling and ripping are used interchangeably to describe soil 
shattering operations. Soil shattering involves pulling one tooth, or a set of 
teeth, at various depths through the soil to break up compaction created by 
equipment traffic. The rock ripper is a common tool found on most construction 
sites. When used to break up compaction, one or two large ripper tines are 
typically pulled behind a large bulldozer at 1 to 3 ft soil depths. While this 
equipment will break up compaction in portions of the soil where the ripper 
tines have been dragged, it does not effectively fracture the compacted soil 
between the ripper tine paths (Andrus and Froehlich 1983). The effectiveness of 
rippers can be increased by multiple passes through the soil or by adding tines 
to the toolbar. Even on small machines, up to 5 tines can be added to increase 
soil shatter.</p> 
<p>Rippers have also been adapted to increase soil lift between tine paths by 
welding wide metal wings to the bottom of each tine. These wings are angled 
upwards so the soil between the tines has greater lift, and therefore greater 
shatter when the soil drops behind the wing. When two or more tines are placed 
together on a toolbar, they work in tandem to more effectively break up 
compaction. The resulting equipment is called the &quot;winged&quot; subsoiler 
(Figure 10.8). Andrus and Froehlich (1983) found that the winged subsoiler was 
a far more effective tool for breaking up compaction. This equipment fractured 
over 80% of the compaction in several operational tests, as compared to 18% to 
43% for rock rippers and 38% for brush rakes. However, winged subsoilers are 
not practical in all soils, especially those with high rock fragments, buried 
wood, or slopes greater than 3H:1V gradients.</p> 
<p><b>Figure 10.9 &mdash;</b> The effectiveness of subsoiling or ripping 
equipment to shatter compacted soil is a function of tine depth, number of 
tines, distance between tines, and wing configuration. Pulling a single tine 
(A) above a critical depth does some soil shattering as compared to a single 
tine ripping deeper than a critical depth (B). Placing 3 or more tines together 
(C) can be more effective than one tine, but tine spacing should not be too far 
apart or soils between the tines will not be shattered (D). Attaching wings to 
the tines is very effective in shattering compaction between the tines (E) 
(modified after Andrus and Froehlich 1983).</p> 
<p>Achieving good shatter at deeper soil depths requires that tillage 
equipment be adjusted for site-specific soil conditions, especially soil 
texture, soil moisture, and large rock content. Soils should not be too moist 
during ripping because the tines will slice through the soil, causing very 
little soil shatter. Subsoiling when soils are extremely dry can bring up large 
blocks of soils, especially when the soils are high in clays (cohesive soils).
</p> 
<p>The winged subsoiler and rock ripper should be adjusted to meet the soil 
conditions of the site. Making the proper adjustments can lead to greater 
shatter and more efficient use of tractor equipment. These adjustments include:
</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Tine depth,</li> 
<li>Tine spacing,</li> 
<li>Number of tines, and</li> 
<li>Wing width and angle (for winged subsoiler).</li> </ul> 
<p>Tines should be set above the critical depth for the condition of the soil. 
If tines are set below this depth, the tines will not shatter the soil (Figure 
10.9B). The critical depth changes for soil type and tine configuration. Soils 
high in clays with high soil moisture have shallower critical depths (Andrus 
and Froehlich 1983). The closer the spacing of tines, the greater the 
shattering. The more tines that are placed on a toolbar, the more area of soil 
can be shattered. However, where large rocks or large slash are present, 
closely spaced tines will drag these materials out of the ground. Three to five 
tines are typically used for most soil types. Wing size, angle, and shape of 
the tines all play a role in breaking up compaction (See Inset 10.2 for 
specifications for winged subsoiler).</p> 
<p>Typical settings for rock ripper and winged subsoiler equipment 
configurations are shown in Table 10.4. These are suggested settings and should 
not be applied without first monitoring the results of the equipment on the 
project soils. The most direct method for monitoring soil shatter is to measure 
the depth to the compacted soil with a soil penetrometer or shovel (SeeSection 
5.3.3.1). Immediately after a pass is made with the tillage equipment, the 
penetrometer is pushed into the soil and the depth to the compacted layer is 
recorded. Measurements are taken every 6 inches across a small transect 
perpendicular to the direction of the tractor and spanning the width of the 
tillage disturbance. Plotting the depths to compaction on graph paper gives a 
cross-section of the shattering pattern (Figure 10.9 is an example of plotting 
soil shatter). If the shattering pattern is inadequate, adjustments can be made 
to the tine depth, tine spacing, and angle of the wing. If these adjustments 
fail to increase soil shatter, a second and even third pass by the ripper or 
winged subsoiler should be considered. Successive passes should be made at 45 
to 90&deg; angles from the first pass to achieve the greatest benefit.</p> 
<p><b>Table 10.4 &mdash;</b> Recommended design features for some tillage 
equipment (modified after Andrus and Froehlich 1983; Froehlich and Miles 1984).
</p> 
<p>A general rule for tillage work is to operate equipment on the contour to 
reduce the potential of water concentrating in the paths of the furrows and 
creating soil erosion problems. Operating equipment on the contour (cross 
slope) is limited to gentler slopes (Table 10.4). To optimize the use of 
equipment on steep slopes, down-slope operation of equipment must not create 
long, continuous furrows. It is also important to consider that if cuts and 
fills are left less compacted, there will be deeper rills and gullies created 
if concentrated flows of water are directed onto these slopes. These features 
are unsightly and can deliver high quantities of sediment to watercourses. 
Therefore, on slopes that have been tilled, it is important to redirect any 
concentrated flow of water that might enter the top of the cut to areas that 
are designed to handle this water. While it is not the job of the revegetation 
specialist to walk the tops of cuts and fills to determine whether concentrated 
water might flow into areas that are not designed for it, the success of the 
tillage project might depend on it.</p> 
<p><b>Figure 10.10 &mdash;</b> The subsoiling grapple rake is a quick-mounting 
attachment to excavating machinery that combines several operations in one: (A) 
subsoiling with winged tines, (B) soil incorporation with bucket, and (C) 
removal of rock and slash with grapples (Photo courtesy of Mike Karr, Umpqua 
National Forest).</p> 
<p>Most soil shattering equipment is attached to a tractor toolbar and is 
limited to slope gradients of 3H:1V or less. Subsoilers and rippers are best 
used for projects that consist of gentle terrain or obliterated road sections. 
Newer equipment, such as the subsoiling grapple rake, has been developed to 
overcome these limitations. Attached to the arm of an excavator, this equipment 
can reach 35 feet up and down slope and specifically rip targeted areas of 
compacted soil (Figure 10.10).</p> 
<h4>10.1.2.3 Incorporate Soil Amendments</h4> 
<p>Tilling is used to incorporate fertilizers, organic matter, lime, and other 
amendments evenly throughout the soil, while loosening compacted soils. Tilling 
with these objectives requires equipment that mixes soil, such as plows, 
tillers, disks, chisels, and soil spaders. This equipment is tractor-drawn and 
limited to gentle slope gradients (5H:1V or greater) and soils low in rock 
fragments. These tools are not designed to break up deep compaction. Under most 
disturbed soil conditions, the best that can be expected this equipment is 
tillage to a depth of 8 to 12 inches.</p> 
<p>Rippers and subsoilers are not very effective in incorporating materials 
such as fertilizers or organic matter into the soil. Nevertheless, spreading 
mulch on the soil surface prior to ripping or subsoiling usually incorporates 
enough organic matter into the soil surface to enhance infiltration rates (Luce 
1997). In the same manner, fertilizers applied to the soil surface, especially 
those containing immobile nutrients, will be mixed into the top several inches 
of soil and made available to surface roots. On projects where topsoil has been 
salvaged and reapplied, subsoilers or rippers are the preferred equipment. 
Using equipment that mixes soils runs the risk of incorporating salvaged 
topsoil with the infertile subsoil.</p> 
<p>A more recent set of specialized revegetation tools that mix and 
incorporate amendments have been developed for the tracked excavator. The arm 
of the excavator can reach 35 to 40 feet on steep cut and fill slopes and work 
soils that were previously inaccessible to most equipment. The simplest 
excavator attachment is the bucket which can be used to move topsoil or organic 
matter to concentrated locations and creating mounds or planting islands (See
Section 10.1.8). When islands are created for deep-rooted species, such as 
shrubs and trees, soil can be excavated several feet deep with the excavator 
bucket and incorporated with organic matter amendments to create a deep rooting 
profile.</p> 
<p>The subsoiler grapple rake (Figure 10.10) adds several design features to 
the excavator bucket. In addition to mixing organic amendments into the soil, 
the subsoiler grapple rake can remove large rock with the grapples and loosen 
soils with the winged subsoiling tines.</p> 
<p><b>Inset 10.2 &mdash; Contract Specifications for a Winged Subsoiler</b></p>
<p>A winged subsoiler consists of a self-drafting, winged subsoiler on a dolly 
mount, sized for use with a D-7 tractor. The unit consists of three winged 
ripper tines capable of extending 12 to 34 inches below the draw bar. Wings 
shall be at least 20 inches wide with a 2 inch lift of the wings from 
horizontal. Tines shall have an individual tripping mechanism that 
automatically resets; tine spacing must be adjustable and individual tines must 
be removable. Various wing patterns must be available and easily 
interchangeable. Implement must be capable of achieving maximum fracture of 
compacted soils (minimum 24 inches) in one pass (Adapted from Wenatchee 
National Forest contract specifications).</p> 
<h4>10.1.2.4 Roughen Soil Surfaces</h4> 
<p>Tilling is often done to roughen the soil surface for erosion control and 
to create a more optimum seedbed (SeeSection 5.6.7). The micro-topography of a 
roughened surface consists of discontinuous ridges and valleys. The valleys 
become the catch basins for seeds and surface runoff. Seeds have greater 
opportunities to germinate and become established in the micro-valleys because 
of increased moisture, higher humidity, protection from the wind, and shelter 
from the sun. Surface roughening is a side benefit of the mixing and shattering 
operations discussed above inSection 10.1.2.2 and Section 10.1.2.3. Roughening 
is also accomplished by either scarifying or imprinting operations.</p> 
<p>Scarification is the shallow loosening of the soil surface using brush 
blades, harrows, chains, disks, and chisels. Because it only loosens the soil 
surface several inches, the benefits for revegetation are only seen during seed 
germination and early seedling establishment. Once root systems hit the hard 
compacted layer several inches below the loosened surface, plant growth is 
curtailed.</p> 
<p>Imprinting is a form of surface tillage that leaves the soil with a pattern 
of ridges and valleys. The equipment applies a downward compressive force to a 
metal mold, leaving an impression on the soil surface. The most basic type of 
imprinting is trackwalking (Figure 10.11). In this operation, tracked equipment 
are &quot;walked&quot; up and down cut and fill slopes, leaving a pattern of 
tractor cleat imprints on the soil surface no deeper than an inch or two deep. 
Imprinting methods that are tractor-based are restricted by slope gradients. 
Since heavy equipment is used, trackwalking can compact soils. Compaction is 
not often considered when selecting trackwalking practices because soils of 
most construction sites are already very compacted, and trackwalking is 
unlikely to significantly increase compaction. This is one reason why 
trackwalking has been considered beneficial for erosion control and 
revegetation because it does create a somewhat better &quot;short-term&quot; 
growing environment and reduces surface erosion and sedimentation on a very 
poor site.</p> 
<p>An alternative to trackwalking is the use of the bucket of an excavator to 
pack and imprint the soil surface. Different patterns of steel 
&quot;teeth&quot; can be welded on the face of the bucket to achieve the 
desired surface micro-relief. Figure 10.12 shows a makeshift imprinter, which 
is simply 4 strips of angle iron welded to a bucket to create a pattern of 
3-inch deep impressions. The excavator in this example can move topsoil in 
place, shape the cut and fill slopes, and imprint the surface, all with one 
operation.</p> 
<p>If the last operation on a construction site is to subsoil or rip soils 1.5 
to 2 ft deep and leave the soil surface in a roughened condition prior to 
revegetation, trackwalking would be more detrimental than beneficial on most 
soils. The tractor used to create imprints would compact the tilled soil 
leaving the surface smoother (less rough) than if left alone. If one of the 
construction objectives is to leave the construction soils in non-compacted 
condition, the use of trackwalking should be seriously weighed against the 
long-term impacts to plant establishment and growth. Compaction will affect 
surface infiltration and runoff, therefore, trackwalking should be critically 
evaluated for its potential increase in soil erosion. Rainfall simulation tests 
can be run on sites near the construction project that have been trackwalked 
and compared with those that have been left in an uncompacted state to 
determine the effects on runoff and soil erosion (Hogan and others 2007).</p> 
<p><b>Figure 10.11 &mdash;</b> Trackwalking creates imprints on the soil 
surface, but will also compact surface and subsurface soils.</p> 
<p><b>Figure 10.12 &mdash;</b> An alternative form of imprinting road cuts and 
fills that does not compact soils is welding angle iron onto the bucket of an 
excavator. As the excavator pulls topsoil into place and contours the slope, it 
presses the face of the bucket into the soil surface to form surface imprints.
</p> 
<p>Specialized imprinters have been developed for rangeland restoration. For 
example, the &quot;Dixon&quot; imprinter was developed to restore perennial 
grasses for rangelands in Arizona and other arid states. It consists of a 
roller with large conical metal &quot;teeth&quot; that is pulled behind a 
tractor. The imprinter creates a pattern of V-shaped troughs, 4 to 7 inches 
deep, encompassing approximately 1 ft2 area (Dixon and Carr 2001a, 2001b). 
These imprints are substantially larger and deeper than those created by 
trackwalking, with greater longevity. This equipment also has a set of ripping 
shanks attached to the tractor that shatters deeper compaction before 
imprinting.</p>

<h3>10.1.3 Mulches</h3> 
<h4>10.1.3.1 Introduction</h4> 
<p>Mulch is defined as a protective material placed on the soil surface to 
prevent evaporation, moderate surface temperatures, prevent weed establishment, 
enrich the soil, and reduce erosion. Mulches therefore have many functions or 
roles in the recovery of native vegetation to a disturbed site. But confusion 
often arises around the use of mulches on revegetation projects unless the 
reasons for using them in a project are clearly defined. In this discussion, we 
have grouped mulches into four uses based on revegetation objectives:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Seed Covering,</li> 
<li>Seedling Mulch,</li> 
<li>Soil Improvement, and</li> 
<li>Seed Supply.</li> </ul> 
<p>For most projects, mulches are used to meet more than one objective. 
Problems arise when the methods for applying overlapping objectives are not 
compatible. For example, erosion control objectives and seed covering 
objectives go hand-in-hand because the soil surface needs to be stable for 
seeds to germinate and grow into young seedlings. In turn, the surface 
ultimately becomes stable through the establishment of young plants. Yet 
erosion control products and practices that are effective for controlling 
surface erosion are not always optimal for establishing vegetation. For this 
reason, it is important to understand the objectives for mulching and to 
integrate them into a comprehensive strategy when selecting mulch types and 
application methods.</p> 
<p>This section discusses the objectives for applying mulches and the 
potential mulch sources. We have left the discussion of the effectiveness of 
mulches for erosion control and surface stabilization to the many publications 
and research devoted to this topic and focus primarily on the characteristics 
of mulches for plant establishment.</p> 
<h4>10.1.3.2 Seed Covering</h4> 
<p>One of the principal reasons for applying mulch is to enhance seed 
germination and early seedling establishment. During this critical period, 
desirable mulches will:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Protect seeds and young seedlings from soil splash, sheet erosion, and 
freeze-thaw;</li> 
<li>Keep seeds moist during germination;</li> 
<li>Moderate surface temperatures during germination;</li> 
<li>Keep young seedlings from drying out; and</li> 
<li>Prevent salts from wicking to the surface and harming newly germinating 
seedlings.</li> </ul> 
<p><b>Figure 10.13 &mdash;</b> Long-fibered mulches, like wood strands shown 
below, create a good growing environment because seeds and seedlings are 
protected from excessive drying during germination and early seedling 
establishment. On sites where freeze-thaw is prevalent, long-fibered mulches 
can insulate the soil and protect emerging seedlings.</p> 
<p>The characteristics of mulch materials that make ideal seed coverings are 
those that protect seeds from drying winds, solar radiation, high 
evapotranspiration rates, and surface erosion while still allowing seeds to 
germinate and grow through the mulch into healthy seedlings. Long-fibered 
mulches, such as straw, wood strands, pine needles, and ground or chipped wood, 
placed at the appropriate thickness, usually meet these characteristics. When 
applied correctly, the strands of long-fibered mulch loosely bridge on top of 
each other, much like &quot;pick-up-sticks,&quot; forming large air spaces or 
pores (Figure 10.13). Large pores function much like the air spaces in building 
insulation by moderating extreme temperatures.</p> 
<p>Compared to short-fibered mulches, such hydromulch, long-fibered mulches 
can be applied at greater thicknesses, which help maintain surface soil 
moisture and higher humidity around germinating seeds and emerging seedlings. 
In addition, long-fibered mulches can mitigate the effects of frost heaving at 
the soil surface (Kay 1978), significantly reduce high surface temperatures 
(Slick and Curtis 1985), and allow sunlight penetration, which enhances seed 
germination and seedling establishment. Large pores created by long-fibered 
mulches also allow better gas exchange between the soil and atmosphere (Borland 
1990).</p> 
<p>Short-fibered mulches, on the other hand, have smaller pores and form 
denser seed covers. These materials are typically applied thinly (Figure 
10.14), so they offer less insulation than long-fibered mulches and therefore 
have less value as a seed covering. Some researchers suggest that very fine 
textured mulches can actually increase surface evaporation by wicking moisture 
from the soil to the surface of the mulch (Slick and Curtis 1985; Borland 1990; 
Bainbridge and others 2001). Short-fibered mulches are effective as an erosion 
control cover, but are considered inferior to long-fibered mulches for 
germination and early seedling establishment (Kill and Foote 1971; Meyer and 
others 1971; Kay 1974, 1978, 1983; Racey and Raitanen 1983; Dyer 1984; Wolf and 
others 1984; Norland 2000).</p> 
<p><b>Figure 10.14 &mdash;</b> Hydromulch with tackifier can stabilize the 
soil surface for up to a year, but does not necessarily create an optimum 
environment for germinating seeds. The short-fibered textures typically form a 
covering that is too thin to maintain moisture around the seeds during 
germination when the weather is dry. The hydromulch (dyed with a green tracer) 
shown in this picture is applied at approximately 1,500 lb/ac.</p> 
<p>Erosion mats can perform well as seed covers (See Section 10.1.3.8). These 
materials come in rolls or sheets, which are laid out on disturbed soils and 
anchored in place after seeds have been sown. They are composed of such 
materials as polypropylene, straw, coconut, hay, wood excelsior, and jute. Good 
characteristics of erosion mats for seed germination and early seedling growth 
are those with enough loft, or porosity, to create a micro-environment for seed 
germination while allowing some sunlight to penetrate to the surface of the 
soil (Figure 10.15).</p> 
<p>On sites where vegetation is expected to take several years to establish 
(e.g., arid, high elevation sites), it is important to apply a mulch with a 
longevity of more than one year. Materials with greatest longevity are most 
long-fibered wood mulches, as well as erosion mats made from polypropylene. 
Straw, hay, and short-fibered wood products are less likely to be present after 
the first year.</p> 
<p>Mulching for seed covering is critical on sites that have: 1) high 
evapotranspiration rates during germination, 2) unstable soil surfaces, 3) 
susceptibility to freeze-thaw, and 4) high soil pH. It is less important on 
sites where soil surfaces do not dry out during seed germination or on projects 
where seeds have been covered by soil.</p> 
<h4>10.1.3.3 Seedling Mulch</h4> 
<p>Mulch is placed around newly planted or established plants to improve 
survival and growing conditions by:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Reducing surface evaporation,</li> 
<li>Preventing the establishment of competing vegetation,</li> 
<li>Moderating surface temperatures, and</li> 
<li>Allowing water infiltration. </li> </ul> 
<p>Studies have shown that survival and growth of young trees are 
significantly increased by applying mulches around seedlings at the time of 
planting (DeByle 1969; Lowenstein and Ptikin 1970; Davies 1988a, 1988b). 
Mulching around seedlings results in the greatest benefit on hot and dry sites 
(typically south and west aspects) and sites with aggressive competing 
vegetation. It is less important to mulch around seedlings on sites that have a 
low potential for establishing competing vegetation the first several years 
after planting. Mulching is also less critical on sites that have low 
evapotranspiration rates or high summer rainfall.</p> 
<p>Seedling mulches are applied either as an organic aggregate or as sheets. 
Organic aggregate mulches consist of shredded or chipped wood derived from 
bark, wood, branches, sawdust, or lawn clippings applied deeply around 
seedlings. Sheet mulches are large pieces of non-permeable or slightly 
permeable materials made from translucent plastic, newspaper, or geotextiles 
(woven fabrics) that are anchored around planted seedlings (Figure 10.16).</p> 
<p>Sheet Mulches &mdash; A variety of sheet mulches are available 
commercially. These mulches are popular because of the relative ease of 
transport and installation. The effectiveness of sheet mulches increases with 
the size of the sheets. For most hot, dry sites, a 2.5 by 2.5 ft sheet is 
considered to be the minimum dimension (Cleary and others 1988). On harsher 
sites, 3 by 3 ft or even 4 by 4 ft sheets are necessary to control competing 
vegetation. When purchasing and installing sheet mulches, the following should 
be considered (after Davies 1988a, 1988b):</p> 
<ol> 
<li><b>Select the right size.</b> The size of the mulch should be based on 
site conditions and the type and amount of competing vegetation. A hot, 
south-facing site with full cover of competing grasses will need a large sheet 
mulch; a north-facing slope with scattered forbs and grasses will suffice with 
the smallest size.</li> </ol> 
<p><b>Figure 10.15 &mdash;</b> Erosion mats can be good seed covers. Mats with 
the highest loft create the best microenvironment for seed germination while 
allowing some sunlight to penetrate to the surface of the soil.</p> 
<p><b>Figure 10.16 &mdash;</b> Sheet mulches come in a variety of materials, 
such as the paper/cardboard product shown in this picture. The size of the 
sheet mulch must be large enough to keep competing vegetation away from the 
seedling. The 3 by 3 ft sheet mulch shown around this Pacific madrone (<em>
Arbutus menziesii</em>) seedling is the minimum size for this site.</p> 
<ol> 
<li> <b>Order only opaque materials.</b> Translucent materials should not be 
used as sheet mulches because weed seeds can germinate and grow under these 
materials. During the summer, surface temperatures under translucent materials 
can be lethal to seedling roots.</li> 
<p><b>Figure 10.17 &mdash; </b>This photograph was taken in late summer, 
months after adjacent soils had dried out. The lack of competing vegetation and 
the low surface evaporation resulting from the placement of 3 to 4 inches of 
coarse sawdust resulted in very high soil moisture. The high C:N of the sawdust 
was believed to be a factor in inhibiting the establishment of weedy annuals.
</p> 
<li><b>Use sheet mulches with long life spans.</b> The durability of sheet 
mulch should be at least 3 years. It often takes 3 to 5 years for seedlings to 
become established on hot, dry sites (Cleary and others 1988).</li> 
<li><b>Weed or scalp around seedlings prior to installation.</b> Sheet mulch 
cannot be installed properly without competing vegetation being completely 
removed.</li> 
<li><b>Mulch immediately after planting.</b> Waiting until later in the spring 
to mulch runs the risk that competing vegetation will have depleted soil 
moisture, thereby making the mulch ineffective during the first growing season.
</li> 
<li><b>Securely stake or anchor all corners of the mulch</b> The sides of the 
mulch sheets can pull out easily by wind, animals, or competing vegetation 
growing under the mulch sheets. It is important that, at a minimum, the corners 
are staked. For greatest effectiveness, bury all edges of the sheets with soil.
</li> 
<li><b>Consider visibility</b> Sheet mulches can be very apparent in high 
visibility areas. Measures to reduce unsightliness of sheet mulches include 
covering with aggregate mulches such as hay, straw, or wood mulch, or selecting 
sheet mulch colors that blend into the area.</li> </ol> 
<p>Organic Aggregate Mulch &mdash; Organic aggregates are another group of 
materials that, when placed thickly around installed plants, will control the 
establishment of competing vegetation and reduce surface evaporation (Figure 
10.17). These aggregates include hay, straw, or chipped and shredded wood 
materials. Organic aggregates are often used in highly visible areas because 
they are more esthetic in appearance than sheet mulches. They are also used in 
planting islands for long-term control of competing vegetation.</p> 
<p>The effectiveness of organic aggregate mulches on seedling survival and 
growth depends on the depth, total area covered, the control of seed 
germination of competing vegetation, and its longevity.</p> 
<p>The longevity of organic aggregate mulches is a function of: 1) C:N, 2) 
texture, and 3) depth. High C:N materials, such as uncomposted, shredded wood, 
bark, or sawdust, will last longer than low C:N materials, such as composted 
yard materials, because these materials are in the initial stages of the 
decomposition cycle. Coarse-textured materials (Figure 10.18) have greater 
longevity than finer-textured materials because coarser materials have less 
surface area for microbial break down (Slick and Curtis 1985). Coarse-textured 
materials also tend to hold less moisture, which slows decomposition rates. The 
longevity of an organic aggregate mulch also depends on the application 
thickness &mdash; the thicker the layer of mulch, the longer it will last.</p> 
<p>The same factors that affect longevity (e.g., texture, C:N, depth) also 
determine the effectiveness of aggregate mulches in deterring seed germination 
of unwanted vegetation around the seedling. Coarse-textured mulches are 
excellent mulches because they hold very little moisture at the mulch surface, 
and are therefore poor environments for seed germination of unwanted 
vegetation. Fine-textured mulches, on the other hand, create a more favorable 
environment for seed germination because they hold more moisture and are in 
closer contact with seeds. For this reason, many fine-textured materials, such 
as composts, are actually excellent growing media for weed seed germination and 
establishment. As discussed in Section 5.8.1.2, mulch materials with high C:N 
discourage growth of weedy annuals because high C:N materials remove available 
nitrogen that would otherwise give these species a competitive advantage. The 
effectiveness of a mulch in discouraging the establishment of competing 
vegetation generally increases with the thickness it is placed on the soil 
surface (Baskin and Baskin 1989). The most effective mulch thicknesses are 
between 3 to 4 inches (Pellett and Heleba 1995; Ozores-Hampton 1998), but 
thicknesses as low as 1.5 inches have been found to be effective for some 
small-seeded weed species that need sunlight for germination (Penny and Neal 
2003).</p> 
<p><b>Figure 10.18 &mdash;</b> Examples of different types and textures of 
mulches: ( A) freshly ground coarse wood passing a 3 inch screen; (B) freshly 
ground coarse wood passing a 1.5 inch screen; (C) freshly chipped wood; (D) 
composted mixtures of ground wood, biosolids, and yard wastes passing a 1.5 
inch screen; (E) weathered straw; (F) ponderosa pine needles.</p> 
<p>Organic aggregate mulches have several advantages over sheet mulches. 
First, organic mulches can be applied over a much larger area than sheet 
mulches. Some projects have organic mulches covering the entire site, while 
other projects concentrate it in strategic areas, such as planting islands. 
Second, organic aggregate mulches moderate surface soil temperatures, whereas 
sheet mulches can actually increase surface temperatures. Mulch thicknesses of 
3 inches have been found to reduce soil temperatures below mulch layers by 8 to 
10 &deg;F (Slick and Curtis 1985; Steinfeld 2004), which can benefit the growth 
of seedlings on very hot sites. The insulative quality of mulches also affects 
the seasonal heating and cooling patterns in the soil. Soils under thick 
mulches take longer to warm in the spring, but in the fall, take longer to cool 
down. Depending on the temperature and rainfall patterns of a site, this could 
influence seedling establishment.</p> 
<p>Mulch can create problems to planted seedlings if it is placed in contact 
with the plant stem. The high moisture around the stem can be conducive to 
pathogenic injury. On southern exposures, heat will build up at the surface of, 
and directly above, the mulch, creating extremely high temperatures on warm 
summer days. The high temperatures can cause heat damage to stems of young 
seedlings. It is important, therefore, to keep mulch several inches away from 
the stem of planted seedlings.</p> 
<h4>10.1.3.4 Soil Improvement</h4> 
<p>Mulches are sometimes used specifically to increase the nutrient and 
organic matter status of a soil. Composted organic materials are used for these 
purposes and are characterized by having low C:N, high nutrient levels, fine 
textures, and dark colors. While these materials are typically more effective 
when incorporated into the soil, they are sometimes applied to the surface of 
the soil where tillage is not feasible (steep and rocky) or tillage costs are 
unaffordable. Where composted organic materials are applied on the soil 
surface, the nutrient release rates will be much slower. SeeSection 10.1.5, 
Organic Matter Amendments, for more information on composts.</p> 
<h4>10.1.3.5 Seed Supply</h4> 
<p>The objectives for applying mulch on some projects are to spread materials 
that contain native seeds. There are several mulch materials that carry native 
seeds, including duff, litter, and straw from native seed production fields. 
When these materials are applied to the soil surface, seeds will germinate 
given favorable environmental conditions.</p> 
<p>Duff and Litter &mdash; Duff and litter layers are organic mats that form 
under tree and shrub plant communities. These layers are accumulations of years 
of leaves and needles at varying degrees of decomposition. Included in these 
layers are dormant seeds, many of which are still viable. When the duff, 
litter, and seed bank is collected and spread on disturbed sites the 
environmental conditions for breaking seed dormancy of some species may be met 
and seeds will germinate.</p> 
<p><b>Figure 10.19 &mdash;</b> Large mulching operations require access and 
working space. The operation shown in this photograph shows the wood waste 
material being dropped into a grinder with an excavator (left), and conveyed as 
mulch to the bucket of a front end loader (right).</p> 
<p>Duff and litter can be collected from adjacent forest- or shrub-dominated 
sites or salvaged prior to construction. Reapplying them to disturbed sites 
completes several operations at once: 1) adds seeds, 2) covers seeds, and 3) 
adds a supply of long-term nutrients. Although this practice might seem 
expensive or impractical, when compared with purchasing and applying seeds, 
fertilizer, and mulch separately, the costs might be comparable. SeeSection 
10.1.3.11 for more information on litter and duff.</p> 
<p>Native Hay From Seed Production Fields &mdash; One of the byproducts of 
native grass seed production is the stubble that remains in the fields after 
seed harvest. This stubble contains varying quantities of unharvested seeds, 
which eventually end up in bales. If bales are stored in dry conditions, seeds 
can remain viable for several years. When hay bales containing the native seeds 
are spread as a mulch on disturbed sites, seeds come into contact with soil and 
eventually germinate. SeeSection 10.1.3.9 for more information on straw and hay.
</p> 
<h4>10.1.3.6 Selecting the Appropriate Mulch Materials</h4> 
<p>There are a variety of materials that can be used as mulches:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Wood fiber,</li> 
<li>Erosion mats,</li> 
<li>Hay and straw,</li> 
<li>Manufactured wood strands,</li> 
<li>Duff and Litter,</li> 
<li>Composts (See Section 10.1.5), and</li> 
<li>Hydromulch (See Section 10.3.2).</li> </ul> 
<p>The following sections describe these materials and how they are used in 
revegetation projects. Figure 10.18 gives examples of some of these mulches.</p>
<h4>10.1.3.7 Wood Fiber</h4> 
<p>Mulches produced from woody materials are used primarily for seed covering 
and seedling mulching. There is usually a readily-available source of wood 
material from project sites situated in forested environments. Branches, stems, 
bark, and root wads are typical waste products from clearing and grubbing that 
can be chipped or mulched on site to produce various types of wood mulch. In 
the past, this material has been burned or hauled to waste areas for disposal. 
With greater burning restrictions and higher hauling costs, chipping these 
materials and returning them to disturbed sites as mulch are practices that are 
becoming more common.</p> 
<p>Wood Fiber Mulch Production &mdash; Creating mulch from right-of-way 
clearing woody material requires planning and coordination. First the road 
contractor piles the woody right-of-way clearing debris into &quot;slash 
piles.&quot; These piles include tree boles, bark, branches, and stumps, but 
must not contain large rocks or other inert materials that can cause wear or 
damage to the equipment. When clearing and piling is completed, a company that 
specializes in processing wood waste is contracted (typically by the road 
contractor). In this operation, equipment is brought to each slash pile and 
materials in these piles are processed into mulch. The resulting wood mulch is 
either placed in piles adjacent to the slash piles or transported to designated 
storage sites. The timing of these operations should consider the possibility 
of limited equipment use due to fire restrictions, which typically occurs in 
the western United States from mid summer through early fall.</p> 
<p>If undesirable plant species are included in the slash piles, spread of 
these species is likely to occur when they are processed and applied as a 
mulch. This can be prevented by identifying these plant populations on site 
during the weed assessment (See Section 5.8.2.1) and avoiding placing them into 
slash piles.</p> 
<p>It is important to define the desired mulch characteristics prior to 
processing the piles. This can be difficult since there are a variety of wood 
waste reduction equipment, producing different dimensions and fibrosity (the 
degree that wood fibers are separated). Specifying the particle size and shape 
by stating a screen size the material must pass does not always produce the 
desired material. Screens only sort for two dimensions, and not for length or 
fibrousness. Identifying the type of waste reduction equipment can narrow the 
type of mulch produced (Table 10.5). For example, mulch produced by shredders 
is long and fibrous (Figure 10.18 A and B), whereas mulch produced from 
chippers has close to equal length sides, with fibers still intact (Figure 
10.18 C). Visiting with mulch company representatives and viewing the type of 
products they produce is a good way to determine the types of products you can 
expect to receive. If this is not possible, have them send you samples of 
different mulch products. Typically, the coarser the size of the mulch, the 
cheaper will be production costs since more mulch of coarser size can be 
produced in a given time frame than smaller textured mulch. Other factors, such 
as tree species, moisture content, and portion of tree processed, will affect 
the characteristics of the mulch. If the wood is wet during processing, it is 
more likely to be shredded; if it is dry, it will be more chip-like. There is 
also variation in mulches based on species of origin. For example, ponderosa 
pine (<em>Pinus ponderosa</em>) and western juniper (<em>Juniperus occidentalis
</em>) tend to create more fibrous mulch than lodgepole pine (<em>Pinus contorta
</em>). Processed root wads tend to be more fibrous than boles of trees. </p>

equipment (modified from Re-Sourcing Associates and CPM Consultants 1997).</p> 
<p>Purchasing Wood Fiber Mulches &mdash; On projects where waste materials are 
not available for mulching, the purchase of wood fiber mulches should be 
considered. Overall costs are much higher because of the added expenses of 
transporting these materials to the site. If commercial mulch sources are 
nearby, this can be an economically viable option. It is very important to be 
sure of the quality of the material. Testing methods and specifications can be 
developed that are similar to those given inSection 10.1.5.</p> 
<p>Applying Wood Fiber Mulch &mdash; Wood fiber mulch is typically applied 
with mulch-blowing equipment. This equipment has varying transport capacities, 
ranging from 25 to 100 yards of material (Figure 10.20). An application hose is 
positioned where mulch is to be applied and is pneumatically delivered from the 
mulch bins to the site. The amount of mulch applied depends on the objective. 
For seeding, application rates range from 100 yd3/ac (0.75-inch thickness) to 
135 yd3/ac (1.0-inch thickness). For seedlings, mulch application ranges from 
400 yd3/ac (3 inch-thickness) to 540 yd3/ac (4-inch thickness). Note: The 
higher rates used for mulching seedlings are only used in close proximity to 
the plants. The remaining areas are mulched at a lower rate.</p> 
<p>Application rates depend on factors such as length and diameter of hose, 
blowing equipment, elevation rise, and dimension of the area being covered. 
Rates of application typically range from 25 to 35 yd3/hr. If mulch is applied 
at a 1-inch depth (134 yd3/ac), it would take between 4 to 5 hours to cover an 
acre. These are optimum rates because they do not account for the time it takes 
to travel to the mulch source, load the mulch bin, and travel back to the 
application site. The time required to make these trips can sometimes be longer 
than the actual application of the mulch. Using larger transport capacities is 
one way to significantly cut the time associated with refilling mulch bins.</p> 
<p>Mulch blowing equipment can be used on any slope gradient that can be 
accessed by foot. By using ropes, slope gradients of up 1H:1V can be accessed. 
Hose lengths can be attached to extend the delivery of mulch up to 400 ft. 
Since mulch is delivered through hoses, the system will plug if the size of the 
wood fibers exceeds the tube size. It is therefore important that mulch be free 
of large pieces of wood. Using a mulch blower is an excellent method for evenly 
applying wood fiber, but frequent monitoring by inspectors is important to 
assure that the specified amount of mulch is being applied.</p> 
<p>Where slopes gradients are gentle and free of rock and debris, wood fiber 
mulch can be evenly applied with a manure spreader. Mulch can also be moved to 
the site in tractor buckets and spread across the soil surface with the blade 
or bucket of the tractor. Obtaining an even mulch depth is extremely difficult 
using this method, and requires many passes of the equipment that invariably 
compacts the soil. An alternative is to deliver several yards of mulch to a 
planting island in the bucket or shovel of a tractor or excavator. After the 
seedlings are planted, mulch can be hand raked at the specified thickness to 
cover the island.</p> 
<p>Mulch Storage &mdash; If wood fiber is stored for long periods of time, the 
materials should not be placed in piles taller than 10 ft. Fresh piles of wood 
fiber have the potential to spontaneously ignite in larger piles, creating a 
fire hazard and potential loss of material. Consider placing a plastic covering 
over the piles to keep moisture out during the winter because wet mulch is 
harder to apply through a mulch blower than drier mulch.</p> 
<p>Seed Placement During Mulching &mdash; Seeds can be sown prior to or during 
mulch operation. Sowing that is done before mulching can be accomplished 
through dryland sowing methods or through hydroseeding. Applying seeds during 
the mulching operation is accomplished by placing seeds in a &quot;seed 
metering bin&quot; attached to most mulch-blowing equipment. This equipment 
meters seeds into the mulch as it is being applied. The rate at which the 
metering system delivers seeds can be adjusted and must be calibrated prior to 
mulching to obtain the desired seed density (SeeSection 10.3.1, Seeding, for 
seed calibration methods). Recalibration should be done when seed rates or 
mulching rates have been changed.</p> 
<p>Fertilizers &mdash; It is difficult to evenly apply fertilizers through a 
mulch blower system. Outside of mixing fertilizers in the mulch prior to 
placing it into the mulch bins, fertilizing must be done in a separate 
operation, either before or after mulching. Applying fertilizer through a 
hydroseeding system after seedling establishment is one strategy for increasing 
available nutrients on the site. As discussed inSection 10.1.1, Fertilizers, 
the delayed timing of fertilization reduces the risk of nutrient leaching and 
increases the probability that nutrients will be available at the levels needed 
for established plants.</p> 
<p><b>Figure 10.20 &mdash; </b>Wood fiber mulch is applied on steeper slopes

several hundred feet up steep slopes (A) with still enough force for ample 
delivery of mulch (B).</p> 
<h4>10.1.3.8 Erosion Mats</h4> 
<p><b>Figure 10.21 &mdash;</b> Small field trials can help select the most 
appropriate species and materials for a project. The trial shown in this 
picture compared straw mat (A and B) with a polywoven mat (C and D). It also 
compared the growth of blue wild rye(<em>Elymus glaucus</em>) and California 
fescue(<em>Festuca californica</em>) (A and C). The first year results 
indicated that there was much better establishment of grasses on the polywoven 
erosion mat than the straw mat, yet no difference in species growth. 
Maintaining the trial for two years showed that California fescue outperformed 
blue wild rye. These results led to using California fescue and polywoven 
erosion mat for the project described in Inset 10.3.</p> 
<p>Erosion mats are manufactured blankets or mats designed to increase surface 
stability and control erosion. They are available in strips or rolls with a 
minimum thickness of 0.75 inch. Erosion control revegetative mats (ECRM) or 
rolled erosion controlled products (RECP) are applied directly to the soil 
surface for control of sheet erosion and to aid the establishment of 
vegetation. Turf reinforcement mats (TRM) are materials that are filled with 
soil when installed to increase surface soil strength (Kemp 2006).</p> 
<p>There are a multitude of products on the market, with a range in design and 
costs. Figuring out which products will serve your project needs at the right 
price can be challenging. Several state departments of transportation 
periodically evaluate and compare the shear stress, soil erosion protection, 
longevity, and other characteristics for these products (Caltrans 2003; Kemp 
2006) and these documents are usually available on the internet. Since the 
installed costs of erosion mats can be very expensive, it is important that the 
job is done right. Taking the time to select the appropriate erosion mats, 
native species mix, and seed placement techniques is essential for assuring 
that revegetation is successful. Small field trials using different species and 
erosion mats can help in these decisions (Figure 10.21).</p> 
<p>The same characteristics that create an optimum environment for seed 
germination in other mulches are also important to consider when selecting 
erosion mats. Typically, those materials that protect the seeds from drying out 
but allow light and space for germinating seeds to grow into seedlings will 
perform the best for revegetation establishment. The thicker erosion mats with 
the most loft should have better conditions for seedling establishment than 
thinner materials.</p> 
<p>The drawbacks to erosion mats are generally not in the product itself, but 
in how it gets applied to the site. Poorly applied erosion mats can result in 
sheet and rill erosion under the fabric. To avoid this problem, several 
important measures should be taken when installing erosion mats. First, the 
surface of the soil must be smoothed to a uniform elevation before the mat is 
placed. This will assure that when the mat is pinned to the soil, it is in 
intimate contact with the soil surface. Second, the materials must be trenched 
or keyed into the soil at the upper reaches of the fabric. This will assure 
that the material does not move downslope. Third, as with all slopes being 
revegetated, concentrated water should be kept off these slopes.</p> 
<p>Seeds must be sown on the site prior to installing erosion mats. This can 
be done using any type of seeding method (e.g., hydroseed, drill, or hand 
broadcast). Care must be taken during and after mat installation to avoid 
disruption to the seedbed. Unless the seeds are extremely small, sowing seeds 
over installed erosion mats is not recommended because larger seeds will hang 
up in the fabric. Small seeds can be applied over erosion mats if tackifiers 
are not used and if the timing is correct so sufficient rain will move it 
through the erosion mat to the soil surface.</p> 
<p>Some manufacturers offer erosion mats that are impregnated with seeds, 
eliminating the need for sowing. This method is advantageous on steep slopes or 
soil-faced gabion walls (Inset 10.3) where placing seed prior to mat 
installation is very difficult. It is important to work directly with companies 
that provide these products by supplying them with source specific seeds and 
specifying appropriate sowing rates. For successful germination, seeded erosion 
mats must be installed so that the seeds and fabric are in direct contact with 
the soil.</p> 
<h4>10.1.3.9 Straw and Hay</h4> 
<p>Straw and hay are long-fibered mulches used on many revegetation projects 
for seed cover and erosion control (Figure 10.18E). The terms straw and hay are 
often used interchangeably. However, straw is the stubble left over after seeds 
have been harvested from commercial seed or grain crops; hay comes from 
grass/legume fields usually grown for feed. When hay is harvested, it usually 
contains seeds from a variety of pasture species.</p> 
<p><b>Inset 10.3 &mdash; Case Study: Erosion Mats with Native Grasses and Forbs
</b></p> 
<p>Reconstruction of the Agness-Illahe Highway required the construction of 
long sections of gabion walls. Since this highway is visible from the Rogue 
River (a designated &quot;wild and scenic&quot; river in southwestern Oregon) 
and is heavily traveled for recreational purposes, it was important that the 
gabion walls be visually screened using native plants. Gabions were designed to 
hold 12 inches of compost-amended soil (topsoil was not available) on the face 
of the walls by wire mesh frames (Figure A). Placement of seeds at the surface 
of the gabion wall was problematic. Several small plots using different erosion 
mats, seed mixes, seed rates and seed-attaching methods were tested to 
determine how to best meet the revegetation objectives (Figure 10.21).</p> 
<p>The results from these trials indicated that we could attach native grass 
and forb seeds to erosion mats using a tackifier (B). In 2003, we applied our 
findings to the construction project. Needing approximately 33,000 ft2 of 
gabion wall facing, we prepared the erosion mats by rolling them out on a road 
surface, applying California fescue (<em>Festuca californica</em>), gluing the 
seeds to the mat, and re-rolling the erosion mats.</p> 
<p>The seeds held tightly to the fabric during transportation and handling. At 
the construction site, seeded mats were attached to the wire mesh at the face 
of the wall (C) and compost-amended soil was placed behind the screen and 
lightly tamped. The gabion walls were built in the summer of 2003, but the 
seeds did not germinate until late fall after several rainstorms. Figure D 
shows a close up section of wall with newly germinating seedlings coming 
through the erosion mat in late 2003, four months after wall construction. 
Figure E shows 20 to 30 ft high walls in July 2006, three years later, fully 
vegetated and effectively screening the walls from the road and river (Photo C 
courtesy of Scott Blower).</p> 
<p>Straw and hay are often used on revegetation projects because they are 
available, comparatively inexpensive, and generally successful in establishing 
grass and forb plants from seeds. The long stems of these materials create 
loft, or high porosity, that keeps moisture near the soil surface where seeds 
are germinating. This creates a favorable environment for young seedlings by 
allowing sunlight to penetrate and protecting the young seedlings during the 
early stages of establishment.</p> 
<p>Straw is often preferred over hay because it generally contains fewer 
undesirable seeds. The seeds that are contained in the straw may not always be 
considered inappropriate for use in revegetation projects. For example, straw 
from some grain production fields (e.g., rice straw) has seeds of species that 
are not adapted to wildland environments and therefore will not become 
established. Straw produced from native seed production fields, on the other 
hand, is desirable if the fields are grown from identified genetic sources and 
used for projects within the seed transfer zones. Not only does 
source-identified straw act as a mulch, but it also supplies extra native seeds 
to the site. Some native grass species grown for seed production are very 
difficult to harvest and clean. For these species, the seeds are not harvested, 
but baled together with the grass stems. The seeded bales are applied directly 
to the site through straw blowing equipment, accomplishing seeding and mulching 
in one operation (Figures 10.22 and 10.23). This method offers a practical 
alternative to species such as bottlebrush squirreltail (<em>Elymus elymoides
</em>) or western needlegrass (<em>Achnatherum occidentale</em>) which can be 
difficult to harvest and clean.</p> 
<p>Purchasing Straw and Hay &mdash; The drawbacks to using straw and hay are 
that these materials can contain seeds from undesirable species, are 
susceptible to wind movement, have limited application distance, and decompose 
in a relatively short time compared to other mulches. Introducing seeds of 
undesirable species from straw and hay sources is an important consideration 
when choosing a source. There are many examples where, in the urgency of 
erosion control, straw or hay from unknown sources was applied, resulting in 
the introduction of weed species. The assumption in most of these cases was 
that short-term control of soil erosion and sediment production outweighed the 
long-term introduction of undesirable plant species. The potential disastrous 
results from these assumptions need to be understood and agreed upon prior to 
applying hay or straw from unknown sources. Good integration of erosion control 
and revegetation planning can eliminate the need for last minute purchase and 
application of unknown or undesirable hay or straw sources.</p> 
<p>A good source of straw is native seed production fields. Seed growers 
identify straw bales by genetic source, so it is important to be sure that the 
source-identified bales are appropriate for the geographic area of the project 
site. Because of the potential for introducing weeds to your project site, you 
must be very certain of the species present in the hay or straw you are 
applying to your site. Many states have certification programs that inspect 
fields and certify that the bales are &quot;weed free.&quot; Be clear what 
&quot;weed free&quot; means when you purchase these materials. There can be 
other seeds in the bales that, while not considered weeds by the certifying 
state, might nevertheless be unwanted on your site. A conservative approach for 
non-certified seeds is to examine the fields that will be producing your bales 
and observe which species are present before they are harvested. It must be 
assumed that if a species of grass or forb is present in a hay field, seeds 
from these plants will show up in the bales.</p> 
<p><b>Figure 10.22 &mdash;</b> Seeds of some species are baled with straw 
because of the difficulty of seed harvesting and cleaning. The long awns of the 
squirreltail seeds (A) show how difficult collecting and handling these seeds 
can be. The squirreltail seeds are germinating from the heads of the seeds that 
came in the bales (B).</p> 
<p><b>Figure 10.23 &mdash;</b> Straw blowers range in size from machines which 
can apply 30 to 60 bales per hour (shown here) to very large straw blowers that 
can shoot up to 20 tons per hour.</p> 
<p> Some species grown for native seed production are difficult to harvest and 
clean because of long awns (Figure 10.22). An alternative method of seed 
harvest for these species is to allow the seeds to ripen in the fields and bale 
the seeds and grass stems together. The seed bales are applied to the site 
through hay blowing equipment. The seeds are detached from the stem as it is 
blown through the equipment, falling to the surface of the soil and covered by 
the grass stems. This is an effective means of applying seeds and seed covering 
in one operation.</p> 
<p>Some things to require when purchasing straw or hay are: </p> 
<ul> 
<li>Source must meet or exceed State Certification Standards for &quot;weed 
free.&quot; Many states have straw certification programs. Where no standards 
programs exist, acceptance should be based on seed crop inspection reports 
and/or visual field inspections by the COTR prior to harvest. Standards may 
also be set by the Government and listed on individual task orders.</li> 
<li>Straw or hay must be baled and secured according to specifications listed 
on the Task Order. Generally, bales should be less than 100 lbs.</li> 
<li>Bales should not be allowed to become wet after harvest or during storage 
prior to delivery.</li> </ul> 
<p>The quality of straw and hay varies between grass species. Rice straw, for 
instance, is wiry and does not readily shatter, which makes it more difficult 
to apply as compared to wheat, barley, or oats (Kay 1983; Jackson and others 
1988). Native straw is generally longer and stronger than grain straw (Norland 
2000). Yet within native grasses, some species have better properties as 
mulches than others. Larger stemmed grasses, such as blue wildrye (<em>Elymus 
glaucus</em>), mountain brome (<em>Bromus marginatus</em>), and bluebunch 
wheatgrass (<em>Pseudoroegneria spicata</em>) make good mulches because of the 
large leaves and stems.</p> 
<p>Application &mdash; Straw and hay can be spread by hand or with a straw 
blower. For large jobs, using a straw blower is the most practical application 
method. There are many types of straw blowers available on the market, ranging 
from very small systems (Figure 10.23) that deliver from 30 to 180 bales per 
hour to large straw blowers that operate at rates up to 20 tons per hour. The 
distance that straw or hay can be blown depends on the hay blowing equipment, 
wind conditions during application, straw characteristics, and whether the 
material is being applied upslope or downslope (cuts or fills). When wind is 
favorable, straw can be shot up to 100 ft. However, when wind is blowing 
against the direction mulch is being applied, the distance is reduced. Because 
of the limited application range, this equipment is limited to sites adjacent 
to roads. The upper portions of steep, extensive slopes are typically not 
reachable by straw<b> </b>blowers. </p> 
<p>When straw is used as a seed mulch, it is important that the application 
rates are not too deep that a physical barrier is formed. A minimum depth that 
has been shown to control evaporation is one inch (Slick and Curtis 1985). 
Applying too much straw will restrict sunlight and growing space for 
establishing seedlings. A rule of thumb is that some surface soil (15% to 20%) 
should be visible through the straw after application (Kay 1972, 1983; Jackson 
and others 1988). This equates to 1.5 to 2 tons per acre, depending on the type 
of straw and its moisture content.</p> 
<p>Straw is susceptible to movement with moderate to high winds. Tackifiers 
are often applied over the straw to keep it in place (Kay 1978). Products such 
as guar and plantago are used with low quantities of hydromulch to bind straw 
together (Manufacturers have stated application rates for this purpose).Straw 
can also be crimped, rolled, or punched into the soil. These measures will 
stabilize the straw by burying portions of the stems into the soil and can 
increase erosion protection because of the more intimate contact of straw with 
the soil surface. The potential for compaction is increased with these 
treatments and the tradeoffs of offsetting surface stability with long-term 
soil productivity should be weighed.</p> 
<h4>10.1.3.10 Wood Strands</h4> 
<p>Wood strands are long, thin pieces of wood, produced from wood waste 
veneer. This product was developed as an effective erosion control alternative 
to straw and hay (Foltz and Dooley 2003). The advantages of wood strands over 
straw are that it is free of seeds, has a longer life, and is more resistant to 
wind.</p> 
<p>Wood strands, like straw, form a stable cover with high porosity or loft, 
characteristics which are important for controlling soil moisture and 
temperature around the germinating seeds. The large spaces or pores created by 
the wood strands allow space, light, and protection for young emerging 
seedlings (Figure 10.13). Unlike straw, these materials keep their structure or 
porosity over time, and do not compress with snow or lose fiber strength 
through decomposition. While the performance of this new product as a seed 
cover has not been tested, it has all the characteristics of being an excellent 
seed cover. The application rates for wood strands are likely to follow the 
guides for straw &mdash; at least 15% to 20% of the soil surface should be 
visible. This is likely to be greater than the recommended rates for erosion 
control. Installing small test plots of varying thicknesses of mulch would be a 
good means to determine the appropriate thickness for optimum seed germination. 
Wood strands are delivered in different size bales and applied by hand or 
through straw blowing equipment (Figure 10.23). As with straw, this product is 
limited by the accessibility of the site by hay transportation and blowing 
equipment.</p> 
<h4>10.1.3.11 Litter and Duff</h4> 
<p>Litter is the layer of fresh and partially decomposed needles and leaves 
that cover the surface of most forest and shrub plant community soils. Duff is 
the dark, decomposed layer directly below the litter layer (leaves and needles 
are not identifiable in the duff layer) that is high in nutrients and humus. In 
addition to providing soil protection and nutrients, litter and duff can also 
contain dormant, yet viable, seeds from species that make up the forest or 
shrub plant communities. When litter and duff are collected, they should be 
matched to the appropriate revegetation site. For example, litter and duff 
collected from cool, moist sites should not be applied on hot, dry sites.</p> 
<p>The depth that litter and duff accumulates will vary by species 
composition, age, and productivity of the plant community. Dense stands of 
ponderosa pine can produce thick layers of litter. More open forest stands on 
dry, less productive sites will have thinner layers of duff and litter (often 
less than an inch deep). The quality of the litter for erosion control and 
longevity varies by the dominant forest or shrub species. Pine needles provide 
the greatest benefit because the long needles interlock, reducing the potential 
of movement from rain or wind erosion (Figure 10.18F). Needles from species 
such as Douglas-fir are shorter and tend to compact, providing less surface 
stability. Litter from shrub plant communities provides less protection because 
the leaves are less interlocking. Nevertheless, these materials should not be 
overlooked because they can be a source for seeds and nutrients.</p> 
<p>The collection of litter in the western states has typically been done 
manually by raking. Mechanizing the collection of litter has been done in the 
southern United States. The pine straw industry is well developed in this part 
of the country. Baling equipment has been developed for this industry and might 
be applicable to the western United States. Collection of needles and duff 
should be done during the summer and fall, when the litter and duff are 
completely dry. If these materials are not used immediately, they should be 
placed in small piles and completely covered by plastic to keep the materials 
dry. Excessive moisture can turn the piles into compost and possibly affect 
seed viability.</p> <b>Inset 10.4 &mdash; Pine Straw Industry</b> 
<p>Using forest litter as a mulch is not a new concept &mdash; pine needles 
have been a popular landscaping mulch in the southern United States for the 
past 25 years. The &quot;pine straw&quot; industry, as it is referred to, has 
been established to harvest needles in a sustainable manner from young 
plantations of southern pine species to meet this demand.</p> 
<p>Litter and duff can be applied manually to disturbed sites. If viable seed 
rates are high in the litter and duff, and it does not contain large material, 
it can be applied in a variety of ways (e.g., hydroseeder, mulch blowing 
equipment).</p> 
<p>One method for determining the amount of viable seeds in a litter layer is 
to actually conduct a germination test at the project site over a several year 
period by obtaining litter and duff from several potential collection areas and 
testing them on nearby sites. Like soil sampling, samples should be collected 
by obtaining a composite of subsamples of an area. Collect samples from each of 
the plant communities that are considered for litter collection and keep these 
samples separate. Establish test plots at sites that are representative of each 
revegetation unit (these can be reference sites). Each plot should be well 
marked (each corner identified with stakes and permanent labels identifying the 
litter source) and located where it will not be disturbed. Plots must be free 
of vegetation and top several inches of soil should be removed to eliminate 
potential seed sources. A known amount of litter (either by dry weight or by 
volume) should be spread across each plot. Visit the plots during the spring 
and count the number of seeds that are germinating. During the summer or fall, 
identify plant species and count individual plants in the plots. At the end of 
the assessment, calculate the number of seedlings per known volume or weight of 
litter material. These figures can then be used to determine the rate of litter 
to be applied.</p>

<h3>10.1.4 Topsoil</h3> 
<h4>10.1.4.1 Introduction</h4> 
<p>Topsoiling is the salvage, storage, and application of topsoil material to 
provide a suitable growing medium for vegetation and to enhance soil 
infiltration (Rauzi and Tresler 1978; Woodmansee and others 1978; NRCS 1994). 
Topsoiling has been found to increase plant cover and biomass through an 
increase in nutrient availability, water-holding capacity, and microbial 
activity, including mycorrhizae (Claassen and Zasoski 1994). It has also been 
found to increase the number of plant species native to the area. Bailey (2004) 
found that the application of 3 inches of topsoil over subsoil in eastern 
Washington increased the presence of native species by a factor of four and 
increased vegetative ground cover the first and second year by 20%.</p> 
<p>While topsoiling has many beneficial effects for revegetation, topsoiling 
cannot recreate the original undisturbed soil. In the process of removing and 
reapplying topsoil, soils undergo a loss of 1) soil aggregation, 2) organic 
nitrogen, 3) arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) inoculum, and 4) microbial 
biomass carbon (Visser and others 1984). Minimizing topsoil disturbance is 
preferred to topsoiling, especially on sensitive soils, such as those derived 
from granitic and serpentine bedrock (Claassen and others 1995).</p> 
<h4>10.1.4.2 Salvaging Topsoil</h4> 
<p>The removal of topsoil should only be done in areas that will be excavated, 
severely compacted, or buried with excavated material, such as fill slopes. 
These areas are usually identified early in the planning stages. During the 
assessment phase of the revegetation plan, a topsoil survey should be conducted 
to determine the depth and quality of the topsoil that will be excavated (See 
Section 5.5.1). Ideally, only the topsoil is removed in the excavation process. 
Mixing topsoil and subsoil together will dilute microbial biomass and 
mycorrhizal inoculum of the topsoil, which will decrease their effectiveness in 
reestablishing nutrient cycling.</p> 
<p>Topsoil quality should be determined from laboratory tests and field 
surveys. Topsoils with high sodium, high salinity, very high or very low pH, or 
any other condition that may be toxic to plant growth should be avoided (Rauzi 
and Tresler 1978). If weeds are observed during the field survey, it should be 
assumed that the seeds of these species are present in the topsoil and these 
areas should be avoided. During topsoil excavation, the litter and duff layers 
are usually removed with the topsoil. These layers are sources of decomposed 
and partially decomposed organic matter. Under topsoil storage conditions, this 
material will undergo some decomposition, releasing nutrients. Separation of 
duff and litter from the topsoil prior to topsoil excavation should be 
considered when the duff and litter are to be used as a native seed source or 
soil cover.</p> 
<p>It is best to excavate topsoil when soils are relatively dry. Under dry 
conditions, there is less potential to compact the soil or destroy soil 
aggregation. Dry topsoil should also store longer and maintain better viability 
than moist topsoil (Visser, Fujikawa, and others 1984). The period when 
topsoils are dry is generally limited to the beginning of the summer through 
the middle of fall, which may not always lend itself to construction schedules. 
Restricting topsoil excavation operations to dry periods should be considered 
for large topsoil piles or if topsoil will remain in piles for greater than one 
year.</p> 
<p>Topsoil layers are typically removed with either the blade of a tractor or 
excavator bucket. Soil compaction should be minimized prior to removal, which 
requires keeping large equipment travel to a minimum. Topsoil is typically 
placed into berms at the bottom of fill slopes or top of cut slopes and stored 
there until it is reapplied. If salvaged in this manner, small piles are 
created and soil is minimally handled. Minimum berm dimensions are 
approximately 6 ft wide by 3 ft high, which is often not large enough for the 
amount of topsoil that needs to be stored. When this is the case, topsoil is 
trucked offsite to larger storage piles. Because of the potential for weed 
invasion, potential offsite topsoil storage areas should have a weed assessment 
conducted prior to selection of the site.</p> 
<h4>10.1.4.3 Storing Topsoil</h4> 
<p>The question often raised around storing topsoil is how long it can remain 
piled before it loses its viability. Studies have shown that stored topsoil can 
remain viable from 6 months (Claassen and Zasoski 1994) to several years 
(Miller and May 1979; Visser, Fujikawa, and others 1984; Visser, Griffiths, and 
others 1984,) but will decrease in viability after 5 years (Miller and May 
1979; Ross and Cairns 1981).</p> 
<p>Viability of stored topsoil is a function of moisture, temperature, oxygen, 
nitrogen, and time. Stockpiled topsoil has been compared to &quot;diffuse 
composting systems&quot; (Visser, Fujikawa, and others 1984) because, under 
optimum conditions, organic material in the topsoil will compost. Decomposition 
of organic matter in stored topsoil will reduce microbial biomass essential for 
nitrogen cycling (Ross and Cairns 1981) and fine roots that store mycorrhizal 
inoculum (Miller and May 1979; Miller and Jastrow 1992). Optimum environments 
for decomposition include high moisture, warm temperatures, and available 
nutrients, all conditions present in most topsoil piles. Climates with lower 
moisture and temperatures can be more favorable to long-term storage. A study 
in Alberta, Canada, for instance, revealed that topsoil had very little 
respiration or organic decomposition after three years in a stockpile due to 
the influence of the cold, dry climate (Visser, Fujikawa, and others 1984). Dry 
topsoils store longer and maintain greater populations of viable mycorrhizal 
fungi (Miller and Jastrow 1992). If a topsoil pile is to be held over winter in 
areas of moderate to high rainfall, it should be kept dry by covering with 
plastic (which will also keep the piles protected from erosion and weed 
establishment).</p> 
<p>The size of the pile can also affect the viability of the topsoil. The 
interior of large piles maintain higher temperatures and are usually anaerobic, 
which can be detrimental to soil microorganisms. Microbial biomass levels and 
mycorrhizal fungi have been found to be very low in the bottom of large 
stockpiles (Ross and Cairns 1981; Miller and Jastrow 1992). Most projects limit 
topsoil piles to 3 to 6 ft in height. This is not always possible, especially 
when topsoil storage space is limited. Under these circumstances, the size of 
the topsoil pile can be quite large. To reduce the negative effects associated 
with very large piles, topsoils should be salvaged dry and kept dry during 
storage. Large piles should be stored for as short a time as possible.</p> 
<p><b>Figure 10.24 &mdash;</b> Soil testing of salvaged topsoil can be used to 
calculate the thickness to apply in order to meet minimum nitrogen levels.</p> 
<p>Standard specifications often call for temporary seeding of topsoil piles. 
The benefits of this practice are erosion control and maintenance of 
mycorrhizae inoculum through the presence of live roots. This practice should 
be evaluated for each project to avoid the introduction of undesirable plant 
species in the seeding mix if non-native species are used. Alternatives to this 
practice include hydromulching without seeds or covering with plastic.</p> 
<h4>10.1.4.4 Reapplying Topsoil</h4> 
<p>The depth of topsoil application is generally based on the amount of 
topsoil available and the desired productivity of the site after application. 
As a rule, the deeper topsoil is applied, the higher the site productivity will 
be. If the objective is to restore a site to its original productivity, the 
placement of topsoil should be at a depth equal to or greater than the topsoil 
horizon of undisturbed reference sites. Sufficient topsoil quantities however, 
are rarely available in the quantities needed to restore disturbed sites to 
their original topsoil depths. This often leads to applying topsoil too thinly 
across a project site. There may be a minimum topsoil depth below which the 
application of topsoil is not effective. Research on a northern California road 
construction site (Claassen and Zasoski 1994) suggests that a depth of 4 to 8 
inches was required for an effective use of topsoil. On sites where the subsoil 
is unfavorable for plant establishment (e.g., very high or low pH, high sodium, 
high salinity), minimum depths of greater than 12 inches of topsoil should be 
considered (Bradshaw and others 1982).</p> 
<p>Determining minimum topsoil application depths can be based on the minimum 
amount of nitrogen required to establish a self-maintaining plant community. A 
threshold of approximately 700 kg/ha (625 lb/ac) of total nitrogen in the 
topsoil has been suggested for sustaining a self-maintaining plant community in 
a temperate climate (Bradshaw and others 1982). Claassen and Hogan (1998) 
suggest higher rates, especially on granitic soils, of 1,100 lb/ac total 
nitrogen. Using total nitrogen levels from soil tests of topsoil, the 
application thickness of topsoil can be determined using the calculations 
presented in Figure 10.24.</p> 
<p>Once the desired topsoil depth has been established, it must be determined 
whether there is enough stored topsoil available to meet these standards. The 
quantity of cubic yards of topsoil required per acre can be determined based on 
the depth of topsoil from Figure 10.25. For example, if an average of 10 inches 
of topsoil is required on a project, approximately 1,350 yd3/ac topsoil would 
be needed. If there is not enough topsoil to meet this depth, then less than 
full coverage of the site should be considered over reducing the desired 
thickness of the topsoil.</p> 
<p><b>Figure 10.25 &mdash;</b> The quantity of topsoil to apply to achieve a 
specified topsoil thickness can be estimated by finding the desired depth of 
topsoil. For example, a 10-inch depth of topsoil would require 1,350 yd3 of 
topsoil.</p> 
<p><b>Figure 10.26 &mdash; </b>Soil textures that are suitable as &quot;loam 
borrow&quot; are shown in light brown on the USDA textural triangle.</p> 
<p> Where topsoil quantities are limiting, it is important to develop a 
strategy that addresses the location the topsoil will be spread and the depth 
at which it will be applied. The strategy might concentrate topsoil in areas 
such as planting islands, planting pockets, or in a mosaic pattern that blends 
with the natural vegetative community. The non-topsoiled areas could be treated 
with other mitigating measures, such as organic matter incorporation or 
mulching.</p> 
<h4>10.1.4.5 Manufactured Topsoil</h4> 
<p>The term manufactured topsoil (also termed &quot;engineered topsoil&quot;) 
is used to define a soil created to perform like, or develop into, topsoil. It 
is usually manufactured offsite and transported to the area where it will be 
applied. Manufactured topsoil is used in gabion walls, crib walls, or other 
bioengineered structures. It can also be used in planting pockets and planting 
islands.</p> 
<p>Selecting the appropriate organic matter, soil texture, and soil amendments 
for manufactured topsoil will increase the success of the project. The basic 
components of a manufactured topsoil are the loam borrow, compost, and soil 
amendments (e.g., fertilizer or lime amendment).</p> 
<p>Loam Borrow &mdash; Loam borrow is any material that is composed of mineral 
particles meeting a suitable texture class (Figure 10.26). Loam borrow should 
have low coarse fragment content, not restrict plant growth, and be weed-free. 
This material can come from many sources, such as subsoils, river sands, and 
terrace deposits. Loam borrow must be tested and meet the general 
specifications shown in Table 10.6. If the loam borrow comes from subsoils or 
parent material, it should be assumed that beneficial soil microorganisms are 
not present and should be added when the soil is manufactured.</p> 
<p>Compost &mdash; The organic component of manufactured topsoil (See Section 
10.1.5) is composted materials from of a variety of materials including yard 
waste materials (grass clippings, leaves, and ground wood of trees and shrubs), 
sawdust, and biosolids. The heat generated during composting effectively 
reduces pathogens, weeds, and insects that may be hazardous to humans and 
detrimental to reestablishing vegetation. Compost must be free of weed seeds 
and vegetative material that propagate weedy plants (e.g., blackberry canes). 
The material must be well-composted, or stable, which can be indirectly 
determined by a respirometry test or calculated using C:N obtained from 
laboratory testing of nitrogen and organic matter. A stable compost will have a 
low respirometry rate (&lt;8 mg CO2-C per g organic matter per day) and low C:N 
(&lt;25:1). A bioassay test which compares the rate of seedling emergence and 
seeds sown in compost to seeds sown in a control growing medium would be 
useful. Table 10.7 lists specified values for a series of tests that should be 
performed on composted materials used in manufactured topsoils.</p> 
<p><b>Table 10.6 &mdash; </b>General specification ranges for loam borrow used 
in manufactured topsoil. These can be modified depending on the soil 
characteristics of the compost and other soil amendments (modified after 
Alexander 2003b; CCREF and USCC 2006).</p> 
<p>To assure the delivery of high quality organic materials, compost should be 
obtained from a facility that participates in the Seal of Testing Assurance 
(STA) program (discussed inSection 10.1.5). These compost facilities will send 
the latest lab results of the material of interest. A listing of STA compost 
facilities can be found at http://www.compostingcouncil.org. If a STA 
composting facility is not close enough to the project, other sources will have 
to be considered and testing the compost will rest on you. This will involve 
sampling the compost piles and sending the samples to an STA lab (a listing can 
be found at the Composting Council's website). It is important that the compost 
piles be visually inspected prior to purchase to assure that noxious weeds are 
not present on or near the composting facility.</p> 
<p>The compost application rates range from 10 to 30% by volume of the loam 
borrow.Section 10.1.5 discusses how to determine specific organic matter rates. 
</p> 
<p>Other Amendments &mdash; Soil amendments, such as fertilizers, lime, and 
beneficial microorganisms, can be applied to the compost and loam borrow to 
bring the manufactured soil into acceptable ranges for pH, nutrients, and 
microbiological parameters. The type and amount of amendments to apply can be 
determined by conducting a lab analysis on a sample of the manufactured 
topsoil. The sample must be from a combination of loam borrow and compost at 
the expected mixing ratio. From the results of the soil analysis, a 
determination for the rates fertilizers (SeeSection 10.1.1), lime amendments 
(SeeSection 10.1.6), and beneficial organisms (See Section 10.1.7) can be made. 
</p> 
<p>Large quantities of manufactured topsoil can be mixed in a staging area. 
Using the bucket of a front end loader, the compost and loam borrow can be 
measured out by volume. For instance, using a 5 yd3 bucket, manufactured 
topsoil with a ratio of 25% compost and 75% loam borrow would have one scoop of 
compost applied to 3 scoops of loam borrow to produce 20 yd3 of material. 
Additional amendments, such as fertilizers or lime materials, would be applied 
based on calculations for a 20 yd3 pile. Once all the materials have been 
placed in the pile, it is thoroughly mixed using the front end loader.</p> 
<p><b>Table 10.7 &mdash;</b> General specification ranges for composted 
materials for manufactured topsoil. These are generalized specifications that 
can be broadened depending on the soil characteristics of the loam borrow and 
site conditions (modified after Alexander 2003b; CCREF and USCC 2006).</p> 
<p>Purchasing loam borrow, compost and topsoil requires a set of contract 
specifications that assure product quality. The specifications in Tables 10.6 
and 10.7 were developed for the DOT by the Composting Council Research and 
Education Foundation (Alexander 1993b). The tests are based on Test Method for 
the Examination of Composting and Composts (TMECC) protocols. These are general 
quality guidelines and can be broadened or made more constraining depending on 
the specifics of the project. When considering purchasing these products from a 
manufacturer, it is important to request the latest lab analysis. An STA 
facility (See Inset 10.7 inSection 10.1.5) will have these reports available 
while others might not. It is important that these tests be run by STA 
laboratories. It is also good to visit the location of the loam borrow, 
compost, or topsoil sources to determine whether there are undesirable or 
noxious weeds on or nearby the piles. If undesirable or noxious weeds are 
present, do not purchase the materials.</p>

<h3>10.1.5 Organic Matter Amendments</h3> 
<h4>10.1.5.1 Background</h4> 
<p>High quality topsoil is not always available in the quantities needed to 
meet the objectives of a revegetation project. In such cases, infertile 
subsoils can be augmented by the incorporation of organic matter and other soil 
amendments. This practice can be an important tool to begin the process of 
rebuilding a soil and reestablishing native vegetation.</p> 
<p>One immediate effect of incorporating organic matter into infertile 
subsoils is increased infiltration. Water that would typically run off the soil 
surface during rainstorms now enters the soil. Amended subsoils also have 
greater permeability, and often increased water storage. Changes in these 
factors can improve the overall hydrology of the site, making soil less 
susceptible to runoff and erosion.</p> 
<p>Incorporation of organic matter can often improve plant establishment and 
growth rates, especially if composted organic matter is used. Composted organic 
materials increase soil nutrients and rooting depth, which can create better 
growing conditions for native plant establishment. The use of non-composted 
organic materials, such as ground wood residues, can restrict plant 
establishment for the first several years after incorporation because of the 
immobilization of nitrogen. In this section, we will discuss the substitution 
of non-composted organic matter when composted materials are not available, are 
too expensive, or are excessive distances from the project site. Sources of 
non-composted organic materials are almost always available on construction 
sites as a result of the clearing and grubbing of trees and shrubs, and can be 
made available through grinding or chipping operations.</p> 
<p>Incorporated organic matter becomes the primary source of energy for soil 
organisms and, whether fresh or composted, is the driving force behind soil 
development. In the process of decomposition, soil organisms turn cellulose 
into complex organic compounds, while slowly releasing nutrients for plant 
growth. Some of the complex compounds act similarly to glues, sticking soil 
particles together into aggregates, which ultimately create soil structure. The 
slow decomposition of organic matter delivers a steady supply of nutrients to 
the establishing plant community for many years.</p> 
<p>The strategy behind many current revegetation projects is to obtain 
immediate cover with the use of seeds, fertilizers, and other amendments, 
without considering what is needed for long-term site recovery. It is not 
uncommon to find good establishment of vegetative cover immediately (within a 
year) after revegetation work, but several years later find that it was not 
sustainable. Life expectancy of many revegetation projects has often been found 
to be very short (Claassen and Hogan 1998). Incorporating organic matter takes 
a different approach. This strategy puts more emphasis on the development of 
the soils and less on the quick establishment of vegetation. It is based on the 
premise that reestablishing native vegetation will create healthy, functioning 
soils on highly disturbed sites over time. This cannot happen without basic 
minimum soil components, such as an organic source, nutrients, and good soil 
porosity. These components of a soil must be in place if plant communities are 
to become sustainable. Incorporating organic matter into the soils of highly 
disturbed sites is an important component of meeting long-range revegetation 
objectives.</p> 
<h4>10.1.5.2 Set Objectives</h4> 
<p>Section 10.1.3 discussed the use of organic matter as seedbed or seedling 
mulch. When used as mulch, organic matter protects the soil surface from 
erosion, enhances seed germination, and, with time, breaks down and improves 
the surface soil properties. Applying organic matter on the soil surface is far 
easier and more practical than incorporating it into the soil. Why, then, 
incorporate organic matter?</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Improve soils of &quot;difficult&quot; parent materials,</li> 
<li>Increase water-holding capacity,</li> 
<li>Improve rooting depth,</li> 
<li>Improve infiltration and drainage, and</li> 
<li>Encourage quicker release and availability of nutrients and carbon.</li> 
</ul> 
<p>Setting objectives clarify why this mitigating measure is being considered 
and helps define the appropriate sources and application rates for incorporated 
organic matter.</p> 
<p>&quot;Difficult&quot; Parent Material &mdash; The parent material from 
which soils are derived often plays an important role in how soils will respond 
to disturbances. Soils originating from granitic rock respond poorly to the 
removal of topsoil. Subsoils from this parent material have very high bulk 
densities and low permeability rates. They can &quot;hardset&quot; when dry, 
restricting root growth and increasing runoff (Claassen and Zasoski 1998). Any 
positive effects of deep tillage are often short-lived on granitic subsoils 
(Luce 1997) because they quickly return to high bulk densities and soil 
strengths. Granitic soils can benefit from the incorporation of organic matter, 
not only because of increased nutrients, but because soil physical properties 
are improved. Organic amendments lower bulk densities and help to form pathways 
for water entry, soil drainage, and root growth. Organic matter can also 
increase the water-holding capacity of these soils.</p> 
<p><b>Inset 10.5 &mdash; How Much is Soil Water-Holding Capacity Increased by 
Incorporating Organic Matter?</b></p> 
<p>To determine whether there will be an immediate increase in the 
water-holding capacity of a soil as a result of organic matter incorporation, a 
test can be performed using readily available supplies (Note: This should be 
considered a &quot;relative&quot; test for available moisture, since wilting 
point is not determined).In the field, collect a large amount of soil (at least 
several quart bags). Obtain samples of the organic matter amendment under 
consideration. Make 6 or more containers out of 3-inch PVC pipe by cutting them 
into 4-inch lengths. Secure cheese cloth with duct tape around the bottom of 
one tube. Make a flat &quot;end&quot; piece for the tubes by cutting a plastic 
sheet (or using an old CD) and secure it to the bottom as well.</p> 
<p>In a bowl, mix several samples of organic matter to sieved soil (a mixing 
rate of 4.5 cups soil to 0.5 cups organic matter = 10% organic matter; 4 cups 
soil to 1 cup organic matter = 20%; 3.5 cups soil to 1.5 cups organic matter = 
30%). Place each mix in a PVC tube and fill to the top (the soil should be held 
in the tube by the cheese cloth and plastic). Lightly tamp the container 
against a surface and fill to the top of the tube. Identify the mix of soil and 
organic matter. As a control, or comparison, one tube must have no organic 
matter in the sample. Place each container in a 5-gallon bucket or plastic 
trash can (which must be taller than the length of the tubes). Fill the bucket 
with water just to the tops of the tubes (you might have to fill the bucket up 
to the top a few times) and keep them in the bucket for at least 30 minutes, or 
as long as it takes to see thoroughly moistened soils.</p> 
<p>Remove the tubes from the water and let them drain. After several hours, 
detach the plastic bottoms (the soil should be held together by the cheese 
cloth) and place the ends of the tubes on a large stack of newspapers or paper 
towels. The paper will remove the excess water held at the bottom of the tube. 
Replace paper towels as they become saturated (Note: Place the plastic bottoms 
over the top of the tubes to prevent the soil at the surface from drying).</p> 
<p>After 24 hours, record the weight of each tube. Remove the soil from the 
tube and weigh the tube. Dry soil at 221 &deg;F (105 &deg;C) in a drying oven. 
Unless a drying oven is available, purchasing one can be expensive. An 
alternative is drying each sample in a crockpot. These inexpensive appliances 
can reach temperatures of approximately 200 &deg;F and it is possible to dry 
several samples in a day. When the sample is dry, weigh the sample. Calculate 
the percentage of soil moisture for each soil mix using the following equations 
(be sure to subtract the tube weights from the soil):</p> 
<p>% soil moisture = (wet soil weight &mdash; dry soil weight) / dry soil 
weight * 100</p> 
<p>If there is no increase in % soil moisture with the additions of organic 
matter over the soil with no organic matter additions, it means that in the 
short term, applying organic matter will not improve water-holding capacity. 
For a more accurate assessment, contact analytical laboratories that perform 
soil moisture tests.</p> 
<p>Soils derived from serpentine rock have also been identified as difficult 
to revegetate because of heavy metals, low water-holding capacity, low nutrient 
levels, and low calcium to magnesium ratio. When disturbed, these sites can 
take decades to revegetate, producing a continual output of sediments. 
Incorporating compost into serpentine soils can greatly improve revegetation 
success by increasing water-holding capacity (Curtis and Claassen 2005).</p> 
<p>Water-Holding Capacity &mdash; The incorporation of organic matter can 
increase water-holding capacity of soils with less than 9% available water 
capacity (Claassen 2006). These include soils with sand, loamy sand, and some 
sandy loam textures, as well as soils high in rock fragments. Incorporating 
organic matter to increase water-holding capacity can be critical on arid or 
semi-arid sites, or sites with very little summer rainfall. The increase in 
moisture-holding capacity depends on the type of organic matter and the degree 
of decomposition. Non-decomposed (fresh) organic sources, such as large wood 
chips and shredded wood fiber, can actually decrease soil water-holding 
capacity because these large materials hold very little water (These materials 
can act similarly to gravels).A test for determining how much soil moisture 
will be increased or decreased by the incorporation of organic matter is 
described in Inset 10.5. From these results, the source and quantity of organic 
matter to incorporate can be determined.</p> 
<p>Rooting Depth &mdash; For species that have deep rooting requirements, such 
as trees and some shrubs, incorporating organic matter into the subsoil can 
increase rooting depth. This can be beneficial for plant establishment and 
long-term site recovery, especially when applied to soils derived from 
&quot;difficult&quot; parent materials. Soils that are compacted can also 
benefit from deep incorporation of organic matter. The incorporation of organic 
matter to deeper levels is often accomplished by applying a thick layer of 
organic matter to the surface, and then incorporating it to the desired depths 
with an excavator or backhoe. It is important that the organic matter is 
thoroughly mixed through the soil profile during incorporation.</p> 
<p>Infiltration and Drainage &mdash; The hydrology of most disturbed soils is 
improved with organic matter incorporation. The degree to which infiltration 
and permeability is improved depends on the size and shape of the organic 
source and application rates (see following sections). Finer textured soils 
lacking structure (e.g., clay loams, silty clay loams, and sandy loams) should 
have better infiltration and permeability when organic matter is uniformly 
applied. This objective is applied in areas where water quality issues are high.
</p> 
<p>Nutrients and Carbon &mdash; Applying organic matter can assure that 
nutrients and carbon are available to decomposing soil microorganisms, which 
are essential for rebuilding a healthy soil. Typically this objective is 
applied to soils that are low in nutrients and carbon (e.g., sites lacking 
topsoil).</p> 
<h4>10.1.5.3 Select Organic Materials</h4> 
<p>There is a range of organic material sources to consider. Developing a 
selection criteria based on the following characteristics can be helpful:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Source of organic matter,</li> 
<li>Level of decomposition,</li> 
<li>Carbon-to-nitrogen ratio (C:N), and</li> 
<li>Size and shape of material.</li> </ul> 
<p>Recognizing how these characteristics will help achieve the objectives for 
incorporating organic matter should guide the revegetation specialist in making 
the appropriate decision for each project.</p> 
<p>Organic Sources &mdash; Most available organic sources originate from waste 
byproducts of agriculture, forestry, and landscape maintenance. They include 
yard waste (lawn clippings, leaves), wood residues (sawdust, bark, branches, 
needles, roots, and boles of trees and shrubs from landscape maintenance, land 
clearing, logging operations, or mills), manures (poultry or cattle), 
agricultural waste products (fruits and vegetables) and biosolids (treated 
sewage sludge meeting EPA regulations). In the composting process, usually more 
than one source is used. A compost from one facility might include lawn 
clippings, leaves, yard waste, poultry manure, and ground wood fiber, while 
another facility might use yard waste, ground wood fiber, and biosolids. When 
biosolids are used in the composting process, the resulting material is 
referred to as co-compost.</p> 
<p><b>Inset 10.6 &mdash; Compost Production</b></p> 
<p>The production and use of compost in the United States has flourished in 
the last 20 to 30 years as a result of a ban in many of states on yard wastes 
in landfills. Since 1988, the number of yard waste composting facilities in the 
United States has expanded from less than 1,000 in 1988 to over 3,500 in 1994. 
With the formation of the Composting Council in 1989, research in compost 
manufacturing has increased significantly.</p> 
<p>Composting is the biological decomposition of organic matter under 
controlled aerobic conditions. To start the composting process, there must be 
organic matter, water, microorganisms, and oxygen (A). Heat is also needed, but 
is created by the microorganisms as they proliferate. Temperatures exceed 
levels necessary to kill most pathogens and weed species (B). With time, in a 
controlled composting environment, microorganisms release carbon dioxide and 
water from the organic matter. The rate at which these are released, and 
ultimately the composting time, is a function of the type of material being 
composted and the composting method.</p> 
<p>A variety of composting methods have been developed over the years. 
State-of-the-art facilities and equipment that control and monitor oxygen, 
moisture, CO2, and temperature levels throughout the composting process can 
produce relatively uniform products. The photo above is of a composting system 
that pumps oxygen through a pipe centered in the wrapped piles of compost. 
Temperature and carbon dioxide are controlled through a venting system (adapted 
from Epstein 1997).</p> 
<p><b>Figure 10.27 &mdash;</b> Nutrients are held in different portions of the 
forest biomass, as shown for old growth Pacific silver fir. On a percentage 
basis, tree foliage is the storehouse for nutrients. Mulch derived from 
branches and foliage will have far greater nutrient content than mulch from 
bark and wood (adapted from Cole and Johnson 1981).</p> 
<p>Each organic source has a unique nutrient composition. Green alfalfa, for 
example, has a very different nutrient makeup than organic matter derived from 
wood residues of cleared right-of-way. Even within sources, there are very 
different nutrient compositions (Figure 10.27). For example, most of the 
nutrients of trees are concentrated in the foliage and branches, and very 
little in the bole of the tree. A chipped slash pile composed of higher 
proportions of branches and foliage will contain far greater nutrients than a 
pile composed primarily of tree boles and, as such, would probably be a more 
preferred organic source.</p> 
<p>As organic sources decompose, they contribute their combination of 
nutrients to the fertility of the soil. Knowing the source from which the 
organic matter was derived will give some indication of the amount of nutrients 
that might be supplied to the soil (Table 10.8). This information is important 
to determine whether target long-term nutrient levels will be achieved. 
Nutrient analysis reports should be obtained from facilities supplying the 
compost. Other sources of organic matter can be collected and sent to labs 
specializing in this type of testing (Inset 10.7).</p> 
<p>Knowing the source of the organic matter might also identify contaminants 
that could potentially be harmful to plant growth. Additions of waste products, 
such as fly ash and municipal and factory waste products can potentially 
decrease the quality of an organic source. Testing these materials for 
contaminants, pH, soluble salts, and bioassay (Table 10.9) will identify 
potential problems with materials.</p> 
<p><b>Table 10.8 &mdash;</b> C:N for common sources of organic matter (from 
Rose and Boyer 1995; Epstein 1997; Claassen and Carey 2004; Claassen 2006).</p> 
<p> Level of Decomposition &mdash; Organic matter can be in various stages of 
decomposition; from fresh organic matter with minimal decomposition to compost 
that has undergone extensive decomposition. The level of decomposition is an 
important consideration when selecting an organic amendment. Additions of 
relatively undecomposed organic matter to the soil can have negative short-term 
effects on plant establishment and growth.</p> 
<p>&quot;Fresh&quot; organic matter is recently ground or chipped material 
that has undergone very little decomposition. These materials usually have very 
high C:N and will immobilize soil nitrogen for months to several years after 
incorporation, depending on the characteristics of the organic source. Very 
slow establishment of plants should be expected when incorporating fresh 
organic matter unless a continuous source of supplemental nitrogen is applied 
(e.g., applications of slow release fertilizers, growing nitrogen fixing 
plants). Nevertheless, applying fresh organic matter to highly disturbed soils 
can have a positive effect on slope hydrology and surface erosion. Fresh 
organic matter can increase infiltration and permeability in poorly structured 
soils by creating pathways for water-flow.</p> <b>Inset 10.7 &mdash; The Seal 
of Testing Assurance (STA) Program</b> 
<p>Just as many products at the local market have seals of approval (e.g., 
&quot;Approved by the FDA&quot; or &quot;USDA Inspected&quot;), the United 
States Composting Council operates an approval system for composting 
facilities. The Seal of Testing Assurance (STA) is a voluntary program that 
requires compost manufacturers to regularly test their composts using an 
approved third-party testing facility. The procedures for sampling and testing 
are outlined in the Test Methods for the Examination of Composting and Compost 
(TMECC) protocols. The STA program takes the worry out of purchasing compost 
because you know that you can be assured that the company is reputable. You can 
purchase compost from companies that do not participate in the STA program 
(when the job site is in the back country you might have to do this), but this 
leaves the sampling and testing up to you. This involves traveling to the 
compost piles, systematically collecting samples from the compost piles, 
sending them to a qualified lab to run TMECC tests, and interpreting the 
results when you get them back. STA laboratories can be found at 
&lt;http://www.compostingcouncil.org&gt; (after Alexander 2003).</p> 
<p>Incorporating fresh organic matter is not generally practiced in wildland 
revegetation. However, considering the expense of purchasing and transporting 
composted materials to remote sites, as well as the availability and abundance 
of road right-of-way material that is typically burned for disposal, this is an 
option that should be considered. If shredded or chipped road right-of-way 
material is to be incorporated into the soil, it should be allowed to age as 
long as possible in piles. To increase the rate of decomposition, the piles 
should be moved several times a year to add oxygen.</p> 
<p>Some organic sources have been stored in piles for long periods of time and 
are partially decomposed. They are darker in appearance than fresh sources, but 
the appearance of the original organic source can still be discerned (e.g., 
needles or leaves are still identifiable). These materials are sometimes 
referred to as &quot;aged.&quot; Because only partial decomposition has 
occurred, C:N is lower than fresh organic matter. Nitrogen immobilization, 
however, should still be expected for a significant period of time after 
incorporation. Aged organic sources have not typically undergone extensive 
heating, like composts, and they can contain seeds of undesirable weeds.</p> 
<p><b>Table 10.9 &mdash;</b> General specification ranges for composted 
materials for manufactured topsoil (modified after Alexander 2003; CCREF and 
USCC 2006).</p> 
<p>Compost results from the controlled biological decomposition of organic 
material. The resulting heat generated in the process sanitizes the material. 
The end product is stabilized to the point that it is beneficial to plant 
growth (Alexander 2003a, 2003b). During the early stages of composting, heat is 
generated at temperatures that are lethal to weed seeds, insects, and pathogens 
(Inset 10.6). Fresh, moist compost piles will usually generate heat in the 
first few days of composting, reaching 140 to 160 &deg;F, which will kill most 
pathogens and weed seeds (Epstein 1997; Daugovish and others 2006). The 
resulting material is a relatively stable, sanitized product that is very dark 
brown to black in color. Composts are very suitable materials for increasing 
the water-holding capacity of sandy soils, increasing nutrient supply, and 
enhancing soil infiltration and permeability rates.</p> 
<p>Carbon-to-Nitrogen Ratio &mdash; The carbon-to-nitrogen ratio (C:N) is one 
of the most important characteristics to consider when selecting a source of 
organic matter. It is an indicator of whether nitrogen will be limiting or 
surplus (See Section 5.5.3.1). The higher the C:N, the greater the likelihood 
that nitrogen will be unavailable for plant uptake. When an organic source with 
high C:N is incorporated into the soil, carbon becomes available as an energy 
source for decomposing soil organisms. Soil microorganisms need available 
nitrogen to utilize the carbon source. Not only do microorganisms compete with 
plants for nitrogen, they store it in their cell walls, making it unavailable 
for plant growth for long periods of time. As the carbon sources become 
depleted, the high populations of soil microorganisms die and nitrogen is 
released for plant growth.</p> 
<p>When C:N is greater than 15:1, available nitrogen is immobilized. As ratios 
dip below 15:1, nitrogen becomes available for plant uptake. Most fresh and 
aged organic sources have C:N greater than 15:1 (Table 10.8) and will 
immobilize nitrogen for some period of time when incorporated into the soil. 
When these same materials are composted, C:N approaches or even falls below 
15:1. These materials will then provide a source of nitrogen to the soil. 
Co-composts, for instance, can have ratios between 9:1 and 11:1, indicating 
they are a ready source of available soil nitrogen. Since these materials 
provide nitrogen, they are often considered fertilizers (Ratios below 10:1 are 
typically labeled as fertilizers).</p> 
<p>The period of time that nitrogen remains immobilized in the soil is 
dependent on several factors:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Climate. High moisture and warm temperatures are important for 
accelerating decomposition rates. For example, organic matter will decompose 
faster in the coast range of Oregon than in the mountains of Idaho.</li> 
<li>Quantity of incorporated organic matter. The more organic matter that is 
applied, the longer the immobilization. A small amount of incorporated sawdust 
will immobilize very little nitrogen as compared to several inches of the same 
material.</li> 
<li>C:N of organic amended soil. The combined C:N of soil and incorporated 
organic matter gives an indication of how the type and rate of incorporated 
organic matter will affect the soil C:N. An amended soil with a high C:N will 
have a longer immobilization period than a soil with a lower C:N.</li> 
<li>Size and shape of organic matter. The more surface area of the organic 
source, the faster decomposition will take place. A fine compost will decompose 
faster than a coarse, screened compost.</li> 
<li>Nitrogen fertilization or fixation. Nitrogen supplied from fertilizers or 
nitrogen-fixing plants will speed up decomposition rates.</li> </ul> 
<p>It is not easy to predict how long nitrogen will be immobilized in a soil. 
The variety of available organic sources, unique soil types, and range of 
climates of the western United States make this difficult. For practical 
purposes, it should be assumed that without supplemental additions of nitrogen 
(from fertilizers or nitrogen-fixing plants), the immobilization of nitrogen in 
soils with high C:N will be in the order of months, if not years. To give some 
idea of decomposition rates, Claassen and Carey (2004) found that partially 
composted yard waste with a C:N of 18:1 took over a year for nitrogen to become 
available under aerobic incubation testing conditions.</p> 
<p>A high C:N might be beneficial to soil aeration and water movement because 
it does not break down as fast as material with lower C:N. For example, the 
incorporation of alfalfa hay (C:N =13:1) will decompose quickly, and the 
effects on soil structure might be short-lived. On the other hand, wheat straw 
(C:N = 80:1) or pine needles (C:N = 110:1) can be effective for several years. 
High C:N materials are also a longer-term energy source to soil organisms that 
help create a stable soil structure.</p> 
<p>Nitrogen based fertilizers can be applied to offset higher soil C:N and 
make soil nitrogen available for plant growth.Section 10.1.1 discusses 
fertilizer strategies for reducing the effects of high C:N soils.</p> 
<p>Size and Shape &mdash; The range in sizes and shapes of organic matter 
plays a role in how quickly organic matter breaks down in the soil. Particles 
with greater surface area to volume ratios should decompose faster than 
particles with less surface area to volume. Chipped wood, for instance, has a 
low surface area to volume ratio and would take longer to break down than long 
strands of ground wood or fine screened sawdust, which have greater surfaces 
areas.</p> 
<p>The particle size and shape of the organic source can also be important in 
slope hydrology by increasing infiltration and permeability rates. Long, 
shredded wood fiber, for example, can create long passageways for water. If 
applied at high enough rates, long fibers can overlap, creating continuous 
pores that will increase drainage rates. Wood chips applied at the same rates 
are less likely to form continuous routes for water drainage because of their 
shape.</p> 
<p>Large undecomposed wood can significantly reduce soil water storage due to 
low water-holding capacity of the material. Incorporating large, undecomposed 
woody organic matter into soils with low water-holding capacities should be 
tested first to determine its effect (SeeSection 10.1.5.1). </p> 
<h4>10.1.5.4 Determine Application Rate</h4> 
<p>The rates for applying organic matter should be based on the objectives for 
organic matter incorporation. Each objective discussed inSection 10.1.5.2 will 
yield different application rates. For example, a project objective to increase 
permeability would require the addition of 6 inches of compost mixed into 24 
inches of soil. This is a far greater quantity than if the objective was to 
increase nutrient supply, which would require 2 inches of compost added to the 
top 12 inches of soil.</p> 
<p>Determining rates of organic matter needed to improve nutrient status can 
follow the process outlined for calculating fertilizer rates inSection 10.1.1.2
. If a nutrient, specifically nitrogen, is found to be deficient, the amount of 
organic material to apply must be determined. A nutrient analysis is necessary 
to make these determinations. Figure 10.28 gives an example of how to calculate 
the amount of organic matter to incorporate to meet minimum levels of nitrogen.
</p> 
<p>When organic matter is used to increase infiltration and permeability of a 
soil, a rate of 25% organic matter (by volume) to 75% soil (by volume) has been 
suggested by several researchers (Claassen 2006). This would require 4 inches 
of organic matter be incorporated for every 9 inches of soil. Actual field 
trials could be installed prior to construction to measure the effects of soil 
amendments on infiltration. By incorporating several rates of organic matter on 
plots in disturbed reference sites near the project, the infiltration rates of 
each treatment could be determined using rainfall simulation equipment.</p> 
<p><b>Figure 10.28 &mdash; </b>The following calculations can be used to 
determine the amount of compost to apply to a site. They are based on 
laboratory test results of the compost and threshold nitrogen levels obtained 
from reference sites.</p> 
<p>If the objective for incorporating organic matter is to increase the soil's 
available water-holding capacity, the rate of organic matter application should 
be based on achieving a total available water-holding capacity for the desired 
vegetation of the project area (Setting these targets is discussed in Section 
5.3).Inset 10.5 shows one method of determining relative water-holding capacity 
of amended soils.</p> 
<h4>10.1.5.5 Assure Product Quality</h4> 
<p>Purchasing compost requires a set of contract specifications that assure 
product quality. Table 10.9 is a &quot;model specification&quot; developed for 
the Department of Transportation (DOT) by the Composting Council Research and 
Education Foundation (Alexander 1993b) for composts used as soil amendments on 
roadways. The tests are based on the Test Method for the Examination of 
Composting and Composts (TMECC) protocols. These are general quality guidelines 
and can be broadened or made more constraining depending on the specifics of 
the project. When considering purchasing compost or any other type of organic 
matter from a manufacturer, it is important to request the latest lab analysis. 
A Seal of Testing Assurance (STA) facility (Inset 10.7) will have these reports 
available while others might not. It is important that these tests be run by 
STA laboratories. It is a good practice to visit the location of the organic 
sources to determine whether there are undesirable or noxious weeds on or 
nearby the piles. If these species are present, materials should not be 
purchased.</p>

<h3>10.1.6 Lime Amendments</h3> 
<h4>10.1.6.1 Introduction </h4> 
<p>Agricultural lime is used when soil pH of a disturbed site needs to be 
raised to improve plant survival and establishment (See Section 5.5.5, pH and 
Salts). Liming low pH soils improves plant growth by 1) reducing aluminum 
toxicity, 2) increasing phosphorus and micronutrient availability, 3) favoring 
symbiotic and non-symbiotic nitrogen fixation, 4) improving soil structure, and 
5) enhancing nitrification (Havlin and others 1999).</p> 
<p>Each plant community has an optimal pH range. Plant communities dominated 
by conifers, for instance, function well between pH 5.0 to 6.5, whereas 
grass-dominated plant communities in arid climates perform well between pH 6.5 
and 8.0. Liming is not an easy operation on drastically disturbed lands. Liming 
materials must be incorporated into the soil profile for maximum effectiveness. 
This application is very difficult on steep rocky slopes, which are typical of 
road construction in mountainous terrain.</p> 
<h4>10.1.6.2 Set pH Targets </h4> 
<p>It is important to set a realistic post-construction target pH when 
considering liming because large quantities of lime are needed for even small 
changes in soil pH. For example, raising an existing soil pH of 5.5 to pH 6.5 
takes nearly twice the amount of lime necessary to raise it to pH 6.0. A half 
point pH difference in this case can result in an increase of over 1,000 lb/ac 
in application rates.</p> 
<p><b>Table 10.10 &mdash; </b>Liming materials are rated by how well they 
neutralize the soil using pure limestone as the baseline of 100%. The rating 
system is called calcium carbonate equivalents (CCE). Values for some 
commercially available products are shown below (Campbell and others 1980; 
Havlin and others 1999).</p> 
<p>As discussed in previous sections, it is important to understand the 
characteristics of the reference site topsoils and try to recreate these 
conditions after construction. If the post-construction surface soils have a 
lower pH than the reference site topsoils, then liming can be used to raise pH. 
On a project where topsoil is removed and not replaced, the difference between 
the pH of the topsoil and the subsoil should be determined. When the pH of the 
subsoil is significantly lower than the topsoil, liming to raise soil pH to 
reference topsoil levels (target levels) should be considered. Although it 
might not always be practical to raise pH of post-construction soils to 
reference topsoil values, a minimum pH target of 5.5 should be considered for 
most sites. This minimum standard would make most soils below pH 5.5 good 
candidates for liming.</p> 
<h4>10.1.6.3 Select Liming Materials</h4> 
<p>There are several types of liming materials commercially available (Table 
10.10) and selection should be based on costs, reactivity, effects on seed 
germination, and composition of the material. All liming materials will raise 
soil pH, but not at the same level as pure limestone. To account for this, all 
commercially available liming materials are rated against pure limestone for 
neutralizing effects. The rating system is called calcium carbonate equivalent 
(CCE). Burnt lime (CaO) for instance, might have a CCE of 150, which means that 
it has a 50% greater neutralizing capacity than pure limestone and much less of 
this material needs to be applied to increase pH. A low CCE material, such as 
slag, might have a CCE of 60, which means that it has 40% less neutralizing 
capacity. Liming materials with high CCE, like Ca(OH)2 (slaked lime, hydrated 
lime, or builders lime) and CaO (unslaked lime, burned lime, or quicklime), can 
be caustic to germinating seeds and, if used, should be applied several months 
before sowing (Havlin and others 1999).</p> 
<p>The particle size of the liming material determines how quickly the pH of a 
soil will increase. The finer the material, the faster soil pH will increase. 
For instance, a lime material passing a 100-mesh screen reacts faster and takes 
less quantity than material passing a 50-mesh screen. Finer lime materials are 
more expensive to purchase. If very fine lime is to be used in surface 
application, it should meet the following size requirements: 100% passing a 
100-mesh sieve and 80% to 90% passing a 200-mesh sieve.</p> 
<h4>10.1.6.4 Determine Liming Rates</h4> 
<p>Determining how much liming material to apply is based on these factors: 
</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Soil texture. Soil texture plays an important role in lime requirements 
because the higher the clay content, the more lime must be added to the soil. A 
soil with a clay loam texture requires over 3 times more lime to raise the pH 
from 5.0 to 6.0 than a sandy soil. This is because finer textured soils and 
organic matter have a higher propensity to attract and store bases released 
from liming materials (Inset 10.8).</li> 
<li>Soil organic matter. Soil organic matter (in humus form) has a high CEC 
and requires more lime material to raise the pH.</li> 
<li>Percentage of rock fragments. Rock fragments have little to no CEC because 
they are massive and typically unweathered. Rocky soils will require less lime 
materials to raise pH.</li> 
<li>Depth of liming material. Lime materials are relatively insoluble and only 
change the pH of the soil around where they were placed. Liming rates are 
adjusted based on the soil depth to which the lime material is mixed.</li> 
<li>Lime material composition. Each liming material is rated by how well it 
neutralizes the soil. Less materials with high CCE (SeeSection 10.1.6.3) are 
required as compared to low CCE materials.</li> 
<li>Fineness of liming material. The fineness of the liming material 
determines how quickly the pH will change. Very fine materials change pH 
quicker than coarse materials. Therefore, less quantity of finer grade 
materials will be required for immediate pH soil change.</li> </ul> 
<p><b>Inset 10.8 &mdash; Cation Exchange Capacity (CEC)</b></p> 
<p>The capacity of a soil to hold positive ions (referred to as bases or 
cations) is called the cation exchange capacity (CEC). A soil with a high CEC 
holds a much greater amount of cations, such as calcium and magnesium, than a 
soil with low CEC. For this reason, a high CEC soil requires more liming 
material to raise it to the same pH level. Cation exchange capacity is directly 
related to the amount of clay and organic matter present in the soil &mdash; 
the higher the clay or organic matter content, the higher the CEC. Rock 
fragments have little or no CEC, since they are massive in structure. Rates of 
liming on high coarse fragment soils must be reduced proportionally.</p> 
<p><b>Figure 10.29 &mdash;</b> This spreadsheet, along with Figure 10.30, 
provide the steps necessary for determining the approximate amount of liming 
material to apply.</p> 
<p>There are two methods for determining liming application rates: 
approximation and SMP (Shoemaker-McLean-Pratt) Buffer methods. For an initial 
estimate of how much liming material might be needed to raise soil pH to target 
levels, the approximation method can be employed. However, if liming will 
actually be done on a revegetation project, the SMP Buffer method should be 
used for calculations.</p> 
<p>Approximation Method &mdash; For a quick approximation of lime application 
rates, the calculations shown in Figure 10.29 and Figure 10.30 are used. In the 
examples shown in these two figures, the topsoil was removed, leaving a 
gravelly, sandy loam subsoil at the surface. This material had a pH of 5.0. The 
target pH, based on the reference site for this area, was 6.0. The site was on 
a very steep slope where incorporating the limestone was not feasible (See
Section 10.1.6.5). It was therefore decided to place the lime on the surface of 
the soil through hydroseeding operations. The surface had been left rough so 
that, over time, some of the liming materials would naturally become 
incorporated into the surface through soil movement. The incorporation depth 
was set between 3 to 4 inches (0.3 ft) based on this assumption.</p> 
<p>Generalized curves shown in Figure 10.30 were used to determine the amount 
of limestone to add to raise the pH. On the baseline of the graph, rates of 
limestone in lb/ac that correspond to the surface soil pH (C = 900) and the 
target pH (D = 2,800) were determined from pH levels located on the sandy loam 
curve. The rate of limestone for the surface soil was subtracted from the 
target rate to give the quantity of limestone to add to 7 inches of soil (the 
depth of incorporation upon which these graphs were based). In this example 
1,900 lb/ac of limestone was needed to achieve the target pH (2,800 less 900). 
This rate was subsequently reduced to 639 lb/ac to compensate for the volume of 
rock fragments and the shallow incorporation depth (3 inches instead of 7 
inches). Since dolomite, which has a higher CCE value, would be applied, there 
would be less of this material needed (581 lb/ac).</p> 
<p>SMP Buffer Method &mdash; For much greater accuracy, lab testing facilities 
offer the SMP Buffer Method for determining the lime requirement for a 
disturbed soil. The results from this test are reported in a table that 
includes the quantity of lime needed to raise the soil sample to pH 7. The 
information can be graphed and used in a similar fashion to the example in 
Figure 10.30. The SMP test is well adapted for soils with pH values below 5.8 
and containing less than 10% organic matter (McLean 1973).</p> 
<p><b>Figure 10.30 &mdash; </b>This chart can be used to approximate the 
liming application rates for disturbed soils. The chart is based on measuring 
pH changes of four soil textural classes as limestone is incorporated into the 
surface 7 inches of soil (chart modified from Havlin and others 1999). For 
example, a sandy loam soil has an existing pH of 5.0 (A) and a target pH after 
liming of pH 6.0 (B). The amount of limestone to apply (E) is 1,900 lb/ac, 
which is calculated by subtracting 900 (C) from 2,800 (D). More accurate lab 
results obtained from the SMP Buffer method for determining lime requirements 
can be substituted for values obtained in this graph.</p> 
<h4>10.1.6.5 Apply Liming Materials</h4> 
<p>Limestone materials are commonly applied in powder form through fertilizer 
spreaders or hydroseeding equipment. Fine limestone materials can be difficult 
to apply in dry form through fertilizer spreaders. Pelletized limestone, which 
is very finely ground material that has been processed into shot-sized 
particles, is easy to handle and can be used in fertilizer spreaders. 
Hydroseeding equipment, however, is probably the best method for spreading 
liming materials, especially very fine liming materials.</p> 
<p>Since liming materials are relatively insoluble in water, surface 
applications of lime, without some degree of soil mixing, renders the lime 
ineffective for immediate correction of subsoil acidity. Several studies have 
indicated that it can take more than a decade for surface-applied lime (not 
incorporated) to raise soil pH to a depth of 6 inches (Havlin and others 1999). 
It is important, therefore, to incorporate liming materials into the soil at 
the depth where the pH change is desired.</p> 
<p>Incorporation can be accomplished on gentle slope gradients using tillage 
equipment, such as disks and harrows (SeeSection 10.1.2, Tillage). Liming 
materials can be mixed on steep slopes using an excavator. However, if 
equipment is not available for mixing on steep sites, applying very fine liming 
materials through hydroseeding equipment is a possible way of raising pH. This 
method requires the use of very finely ground limestone (Havlin and others 
1999). This product raises pH faster, and depending on the soil type, can move 
a short distance into the soil surface. Nevertheless, with surface-applied 
limestone, it should be assumed that soil pH will not change much deeper than 3 
inches below the soil surface.</p>

<h3>10.1.7 Beneficial Soil Microorganisms</h3> 
<h4>10.1.7.1 Background</h4> 
<p>Beneficial microorganisms are naturally occurring bacteria, fungi, and 
other microbes that play a crucial role in plant productivity and health. Some 
types of beneficial microorganisms are called &quot;microsymbionts&quot; 
because they form a symbiotic (mutually beneficial) relationship with plants. 
In natural ecosystems, the root systems of successful plants have several 
microbial partnerships that allow them to survive and grow even in harsh 
conditions (Figure 10.31). Without their microsymbiont partners, plants become 
stunted and often die. Frequently, these failures are attributed to poor 
nursery stock or fertilization, when the real problem was the absence of the 
proper microorganism.</p> 
<p>A.</p> 
<p>B.</p> <br>
<br>
<br>

<p><b>Figure 10.31 &mdash; </b>Many plants rely on symbiotic relationships to 
survive and grow in nature (A). The mushrooms under this spruce are the 
fruiting bodies of a beneficial fungus that has formed mycorrhizae on the roots 
(B).</p> 
<p>As discussed in Section 5.3.5, beneficial microorganisms should be 
considered as part of an overall strategy to conserve existing ecological 
resources on the site, including existing beneficial soil microorganisms. These 
strategies include:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Minimizing soil disturbance,</li> 
<li>Conserving and reapplying topsoil and organic matter,</li> 
<li>Leaving undisturbed islands or pockets on the project site, and</li> 
<li>Minimizing use of fast-release fertilizers.</li> </ul> 
<p>On projects where soil disturbance will be minimal, or where healthy 
topsoil is still present and contains functional communities of beneficial 
microorganisms, reintroducing the organisms will usually not be necessary. 
However, most road projects involve severe disturbances and so healthy 
populations of beneficial microorganisms may be depleted or even absent. Soil 
compaction and removal of topsoil which is routine during road construction is 
particularly detrimental to beneficial soil microorganisms. Also, beneficial 
bacteria and fungi do not survive in soil in the absence of their host plants 
and so are killed during soil removal and stockpiling. Reintroducing beneficial 
microorganisms is therefore a key part of roadside revegetation.</p> 
<p>Appropriate beneficial microorganism can be reintroduced by 
&quot;inoculating&quot; seeds as they are sown in the field or in the nursery, 
or by introducing the microorganism in the planting hole. Inoculated plants may 
establish more quickly with less water, fertilizer, and weed control, thereby 
reducing installation costs. Healthy, sustainable plant communities are our 
ultimate goal in roadside revegetation; inoculation can help accelerate the 
process.</p> 
<p>The two most important microsymbionts for revegetation projects are 
mycorrhizal fungi and nitrogen-fixing bacteria.</p> 
<h4>10.1.7.2 What are Mycorrhizae?</h4> 
<p>Mycorrhizae are one of the most fascinating symbiotic relationships in 
nature. &quot;Myco&quot; means &quot;fungus&quot; and &quot;rhizae&quot; means 
&quot;root&quot;; the word &quot;mycorrhizae&quot; means 
&quot;fungus-roots.&quot; The host plant roots provide a convenient substrate 
for the fungus, and also supply food in the form of simple carbohydrates. In 
exchange for this free &quot;room-and-board&quot;, the mycorrhizal fungus 
offers benefits to the host plant:</p> 
<p>Increased Water and Nutrient Uptake &mdash; Beneficial fungi help plants 
absorb mineral nutrients, especially phosphorus and micronutrients such as zinc 
and copper. Mycorrhizae increase the root surface area, and the fungal hyphae 
access water and nutrients beyond the roots (Figure 10.32A). When plants lack 
mycorrhizae, they become stunted and sometimes chlorotic (&quot;yellow&quot;) 
in appearance.</p> 
<p>Stress and Disease Protection &mdash; Mycorrhizal fungi protect the plant 
host in several ways. With some fungi, the mantle completely covers fragile 
root tips (Figure 10.32A) and acts as a physical barrier from drying, other 
pests, and toxic soil contaminants. Other fungal symbionts produce antibiotics 
that provide chemical protection.</p> 
<p>Increased Vigor and Growth &mdash; Plants with mycorrhizal roots survive 
and grow better after they are planted out on the project site. This effect is 
often difficult to demonstrate but can sometimes be seen in nurseries where 
soil fumigation has eliminated mycorrhizal fungi from seedbeds. After 
emergence, some plants become naturally inoculated by airborne spores and grow 
much larger and healthier than those that lack the fungal symbiont (Figure 
10.32B).</p> 
<p>Mycorrhizal fungi form partnerships with most plant families, and three 
types of mycorrhizae are recognized:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Ectomycorrhizal fungi (ECM) have relatively narrow host ranges and form 
partnerships with many temperate forest plants, especially pines, oaks, 
beeches, spruces, and firs.</li> 
<li>Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) are also known as endomycorrhizae or 
vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizae. These fungi have wide host ranges and are 
found on most wild and cultivated grasses and annual crops, most tropical 
plants, and some temperate tree species including cedars, alders, and maples.
</li> 
<li>Ericoid mycorrhizal fungi form partnerships with the Epacridaceae, 
Empetraceae, and most of the Ericaceae; plants affected include blueberries, 
cranberries, crowberries, huckleberries, azaleas, rhododendrons, and sedges. 
Because these mycorrhizal associations involve unique species of fungi, few 
commercial inoculants are available and the best option is to use soil from 
around healthy plants.</li> </ul> 
<p>A.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>B.</p> 
<p></p> <br>
<br>

<p><b>Figure 10.32 &mdash;</b> Mycorrhizal fungi offer many benefits to the 
host plant. The fungal hyphae increase the area of absorption for water and 
mineral nutrients, whereas fungal mantle covers the root and protects it from 
desiccation and pathogens (A). In fumigated nursery soils, inoculated seedlings 
are much larger and healthier than those that lack the fungal partner (B).</p> 
<p>For restoration purposes, the important thing to remember is that different 
plant species have specific fungal partners. ECM fungi are generally specific 
to one genus or group of plants whereas the same AMF fungus can colonize a wide 
variety of species. In addition, the three types of mycorrhizal fungi have to 
be inoculated differently. ECM species have airborne spores that can 
reinoculate soils naturally over time, or the spores can be harvested and used 
to inoculate nursery stock. On the other hand, the spores of AMF species are 
large and released underground and so cannot reinoculate plants very quickly. 
This makes artificial inoculation even more critical.</p> 
<p>Conserving existing topsoil and organic matter is a key practice to protect 
existing populations of beneficial microorganisms. If disturbance will take 
place, then other interventions will be necessary to introduce the key 
microsymbionts for the plants you are trying to establish. Consider the needs 
for mycorrhizal inoculants. Are the species to be established endomycorrhizal, 
ectomycorrhizal, ericoid or non-mycorrhizal? The selection of the mycorrhizal 
inoculants must be based on the target host plants and the site condition. 
Conifer seedlings, for example, require very specific ectomycorrhizal fungi for 
successful inoculation. Endomycorrhizal species, on the other hand, are broad 
in range and therefore a general mix of several endomycorrhizal species can be 
utilized for a broader range of plants. Knowing which species you are working 
with is essential in order to match the plants with their appropriate 
microsymbiont partners.</p> 
<h4>10.1.7.3 Sources and Application of Ectomycorrhizal Fungi</h4> 
<p>Three common sources of ECM inoculants are soil, spores, or pure culture 
vegetative inoculum.</p> 
<p>Soil &mdash; Topsoil, humus or duff from beneath ECM host plants can be 
used for inoculum if done properly. Because disturbance and exposure to direct 
sunlight may kill these beneficial fungi, soil inoculation must be done as 
quickly as possible. Soil inoculum can also be collected under the same plant 
species adjacent to the project site (Figure 10.33A). Small amounts should be 
collected from several different locations and care should be taken not to 
damage the host plants. If topsoil and organic matter are not available on the 
project site, spores or commercial inoculants can be used instead.</p> 
<p>Spores &mdash; Spore suspensions are sometimes available from commercial 
suppliers. However, the quality of commercial sources can be variable so it is 
important to verify the quality of the inoculum. It is possible to make your 
own inoculum from spores. Collect ripe fruiting bodies of mushrooms (Figure 
10.33B), puffballs, or truffles (Figure 10.33C) from beneath healthy plants. 
Then, rinse and pulverize them in a blender for several minutes to make a 
slurry. Fungal spores do not have a long shelf-life and should be applied 
immediately.</p> 
<p>Pure Culture Inoculum &mdash; Mycorrhizal fungi are available commercially 
as pure cultures, usually in a peat-based carrier (Figure 10.34). Most 
commercial sources contain several different species of ECM. Because this type 
of inoculum is made from pure fungal cultures and does not store well, it is 
rarely available from suppliers.</p> 
<p>Application rates and methods for ectomycorrhizal inoculums will vary by 
species. Since these mycorrhizal fungi are very specific to their host species, 
it is important to work closely with company representatives when using 
ectomycorrhizal inoculum. Nurseries may inoculate plants; if this service is 
desired, it must be stated in the seedling-growing contract. Some 
ectomycorrhizal fungi products can be incorporated into the nursery growing 
media prior to sowing (Figure 10.34A) or a liquid slurry of fungal spores can 
be applied during the growing season. However, there is no guarantee that the 
plants will still be colonized when they are planted at the project site.</p> 
<p>Other ectomycorrhizal fungal inoculums are applied at the time of planting 
and here the objective is to get the inoculum in contact with the plant roots. 
Some formulations are mixed with water and the slurry is applied to the roots 
of nursery stock. Tablets or packets can be placed in the planting hole (Figure 
10.34B). However, the effectiveness of many of these applications has not been 
verified by research under roadside revegetation conditions.</p> 
<p>Verifying the Effectiveness of ECM Inoculation &mdash; Luckily, it is 
fairly easy to recognize ECM as the fungi can be seen with the naked eye on the 
root system. Short feeder roots should be examined for a cottony-white 
appearance on the roots or a white or brightly colored mantle or sheath over 
the roots (Figure 10.35). Unlike pathogenic fungi, mycorrhizae will never show 
signs of root decay and the mycelia around the root will be visible. Sometimes, 
mushrooms or other fruiting bodies will occasionally appear alongside their 
host plants. For verification, it is recommended that plant samples be sent to 
a laboratory where they can also provide a numerical rating of inoculation 
effectiveness.</p> 
<p>A.</p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>B.</p> 
<p>C.</p> 
<p><b>Figure 10.33 &mdash;</b> Soil inoculum can be collected from adjacent 
plants if done carefully (A). Inoculum can also be made from the spores of 
mushrooms (B), puffballs, or truffles (C) collected from around the proper host 
plant.</p> 
<h4>10.1.7.4 Sources and Application of Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Fungi</h4> 
<p>The two main sources of AMF inoculants include &quot;pot culture,&quot; 
(also known as &quot;crude&quot; inoculant), and commercially available pure 
cultures.</p> 
<p>A. </p> 
<p></p> 
<p>B. </p> 
<p></p> <br>
<br>
<b>Figure 10.34 &mdash;</b> Commercial sources of 
ectomycorrhizal inoculum are available in several forms: pure cultures grown on 
peat moss or vermiculite (A) are perishable but spore-based products can be 
applied as root dips. Tablets and packets are put in the hole during planting. 
<br> 
<p><b>Figure 10.35 &mdash;</b> Ectomycorrhizae are visible on plant root 
systems as white or colored structures with a cottony or felt-like texture.</p> 
<p>Nursery Pot Culture &mdash; This option is only viable in a nursery when 
plants are being grown for a specific restoration project, and is unique to AMF 
fungi because of their wide host range. A specific AMF is acquired either 
commercially or from a field site as a starter culture, and then added to a 
sterile potting medium. A host plant such as corn, sorghum, clover, or an 
herbaceous native plant is then grown in this substrate; as the host grows, the 
AMF multiply in the growing medium (Figure 10.36A). The shoots of host plants 
are removed and the substrate, now rich in roots, spores, and mycelium, is 
chopped up (Figure 10.36B). The resultant inoculum can then be incorporated 
into growing media or planting beds before seeds or cuttings are sown. This is 
a highly effective technique for propagating AMF in the nursery and could also 
be used on the planting site. For details refer to<em>Arbuscular Mycorrhizas: 
Producing and Applying Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Inoculum</em>(Habte and Osorio 
2001).</p> 
<p>Commercial Products &mdash; Several brands of commercial AMF inoculants are 
available, and usually contain a mix of several fungal species. Because AMF 
spores are so small and fragile, they are mixed with a carrier such as 
vermiculite or calcined clay to aid in application. Coarser textured products 
(Figure 10.37A) are meant for incorporation into soil or growing media, and 
finer-textured products (Figure 10.37B) are applied as wettable powders through 
sprayers or injected into irrigation systems. Inoculation effectiveness has 
been shown to vary considerably between different products (Figure 10.37C), so 
it is wise to install tests before purchasing large quantities of a specific 
product. Laboratories can provide a live spore count which is the best measure 
of inoculum quality.</p> 
<p>Application of AMF Inoculants &mdash; Because AMF spores are relatively 
large, ensuring that spores come in direct contact with the root systems or 
seeds is critical. Spores will not easily pass through irrigation injectors or 
nozzles, and do not move downward or through the soil into the soil with water. 
Therefore, applying AMF inoculum as a topdressing is not a good option. AMF 
inoculums typically come in a granular form with different grades of fineness. 
Coarse grade products (Figure 10.37A) are mixed in the soil prior to sowing 
seed. Finer grade inoculums (Figure 10.37B), which are more expensive, may be 
mixed with water and applied directly onto seeds or as a root dip. Use of 
fine-grade inoculum through hydroseeding equipment is a recent application 
method that shows promise as a way to combine AMF with seeds as they are sown. 
Again, there is little research on AMF inoculation effectiveness on roadside 
revegetation sites.</p>

<p>B.</p> 
<p><b>Figure 10.36 &mdash; </b>Because of their wide host range, AMF fungi can 
be raised on host plants (A) and their roots chopped-up for inoculum (B).</p> 
<p>Verifying the Effectiveness of AMF Inoculation &mdash; Unlike ECM, AMF are 
not visible to the unaided eye. To verify the effectiveness of AMF inoculation, 
roots must be stained and examined under a microscope (Figure 10.37D). This 
verification can often be done easily and inexpensively in a laboratory.</p> 
<h4>10.1.7.5 Management Considerations for Mycorrhizal Fungi</h4> 
<p>If possible, work with a specialist to help with the following:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Selecting appropriate mycorrhizal partners for the species and outplanting 
sites;</li> 
<li>Determining the best sources of inoculant and evaluating their 
effectiveness in the field conditions; and</li> 
<li>Designing outplanting trials to evaluate seedling survival and mycorrhizal 
performance in the field, and modifying the inoculant sources if improvements 
are needed.</li> </ul> 
<p>In addition to learning how to effectively apply mycorrhizal fungi, some 
soil management modifications will be required to promote formation of 
mycorrhizal partnerships in the field. Fertilization is probably the most 
significant adjustment. Mycorrhizal fungi extend the plant's root system, and 
extract nutrients and water from the soil. High levels of soluble fertilizers 
may inhibit their presence. In some cases, fertilizer applications can be 
reduced by half or more due to the increased nutrient uptake by mycorrhizal 
fungi. Fertilizer type and form is also important. An excessive amount of 
phosphorus in the fertilizer inhibits formation of the partnership; therefore 
phosphorus should be reduced. If nitrogen is applied, ammonium-N is better used 
by the plant than nitrate-N (Landis 1989). Controlled release fertilizers are 
preferred because they release small doses of nutrients gradually, compared to 
the more rapid nutrient release from traditional products. Applications of 
certain herbicides, pesticides, insecticides, fungicides, and nematicides are 
detrimental to mycorrhizal fungi.</p>

<h4>10.1.7.6 Nitrogen-Fixing Bacteria</h4> 
<p>Nitrogen-fixing bacteria live in nodules on plant roots and accumulate 
(&quot;fix&quot;) nitrogen from the air and share it with their host plants. 
Unlike mycorrhizal fungi, which are found on most trees and plants, only 
certain species of plants can form symbiotic partnerships with nitrogen-fixing 
bacteria.</p> 
<p>The role of nitrogen-fixing bacteria and their partner plants is crucial to 
roadside restoration. Because nitrogen-fixing plants are often 
&quot;pioneer&quot; species that are the first to colonize disturbed sites, 
they are ideal for revegetation or restoration projects. Nitrogen-fixing 
species are usually outplanted in order to help restore fertility and organic 
matter to the project site. Nitrogen-fixing bacteria form nodules on roots of 
certain plants (Figure 10.38A) and accumulate nitrogen from the air (Figure 
10.38B). While plants that form this association are sometimes called 
&quot;nitrogen-fixing plants&quot;, the plant itself is not able to fix 
nitrogen from the air. It is only through the partnership with bacteria that 
these plants are able to obtain atmospheric nitrogen. In this symbiotic 
partnership the bacteria give nitrogen accumulated from the atmosphere to the 
plant, and in exchange the bacteria get a site to grow and energy in the form 
of carbohydrates from the plant. Without these bacterial partnerships, plants 
are not able to make direct use of atmospheric nitrogen.</p> 
<p>Soil on restoration sites, however, may not contain the proper species of 
bacteria to form a symbiotic partnership with the plant. This is particularly 
true for compacted soils and those that have been removed and stockpiled. 
Inoculating plants ensures that &quot;nitrogen-fixing&quot; plants form an 
effective partnership to fix nitrogen. Therefore, use of nitrogen-fixing plants 
can be an important part of accelerating rehabilitation of degraded land.</p>

<h4>10.1.7.7 Uses for Nitrogen-Fixing Plants in Revegetation</h4> 
<p>Only a fraction of native species are nitrogen-fixing host plants. In the 
western United States, the most common are the lupines, vetch, bitterbrush, 
ceanothus, alder, and myrtle (Table 10.11). On nitrogen-poor sites, sowing or 
planting a higher proportion of these species can help a site to recover 
nitrogen fertility and organic matter (Figure 10.40A). The amount of nitrogen 
that will be fixed on a site is related to the area of vegetative cover in 
nitrogen fixing host plants, the productivity of the plants, and factors such 
as temperature and moisture. If percent cover of nitrogen fixing host plants is 
low, then the amount of nitrogen supplied to the site will be correspondingly 
low (Figure 10.40B). Likewise, dry or cold conditions tend to result in slower 
accumulation of nitrogen.</p> 
<p>To determine how nitrogen-fixing plants should be used in revegetation 
project, assess which nitrogen-fixing host species are native to the area and 
consider the nitrogen fixation rates that can be expected. A plant survey of 
reference sites will reveal which nitrogen fixing plant host species are native 
to the area. Finding host plants on recovered reference sites can give an 
indication of whether they grow on disturbances, and consequently how much 
nitrogen will be fixed on the site. Observing the abundance of root nodules on 
these plants can give some indication whether they are fixing nitrogen.</p> 
<p>A.</p> 
<p>B.</p> 
<p><b>Figure 10.40 &mdash; </b>The accumulation of nitrogen by N-fixating 
bacteria is directly related to the cover of nitrogen-fixing host plants on a 
site. The large plants shown in this photograph are lupines, which are 
nitrogen-fixing (A). The nitrogen-fixing potential of 15-year-old stands of
Ceanothus velutinus and Purshia tridentata was directly proportional to plant 
cover (B) (adapted after Busse 2000).</p> 
<h4>10.1.7.8 Inoculating with Nitrogen-Fixing Bacteria</h4> 
<p>Nitrogen-fixing nursery stock with nodulated root systems have exhibited 
faster early growth than seedlings that were not inoculated. Nursery 
inoculation can reduce costs in establishment and maintenance; a few dollars 
worth of inoculant applied in the nursery can replace a lot of purchased 
nitrogen fertilizer over the life of the nitrogen-fixing plant. Faster growth 
early can also lead to faster canopy closure, which shades the soil and reduces 
weed establishment and growth. When the nitrogen-fixing plant sheds leaves or 
dies, the nitrogen stored in the plant's tissues is cycled to adjacent plants. 
Early establishment of nitrogen-fixing plants accelerates natural nutrient 
cycling on the project sites and promotes the establishment of sustainable 
plant communities.</p> 
<p>It should be noted that in many cases, uninoculated seedlings may 
eventually form a partnership with some kind of<em>Frankia</em> or <em>Rhizobium
</em> strain after they are outplanted. These may not be with optimal or highly 
productive bacterial partners, and it may take months or even years on highly 
disturbed sites. Until they become naturally inoculated, plants are dependent 
on nitrogen fertilizers and may become out-competed by weeds. Inoculating in 
the nursery ensures that plants form effective, productive partnerships in a 
timely fashion.</p> 
<p>Acquiring Nitrogen-Fixing Bacterial Inoculants &mdash; Nitrogen-fixing 
bacteria are very specific; in other words, one inoculant cannot be used for 
all plants. On the contrary, a different inoculant strain for each 
nitrogen-fixing species is usually necessary. Superior strains can yield 
significant differences in productivity and growth rate of the host plant; in 
some cases over 40% better growth (Schmit, 2003).</p> 
<p>Inoculants are live nitrogen-fixing bacteria cultures that are applied to 
seeds or young plants. Two forms of inoculant can be used: pure culture 
inoculant, and homemade (often called &quot;crude&quot;) inoculant. Cultured 
inoculant is purchased from commercial suppliers, seed banks, or sometimes, 
universities. Crude inoculant is made from nodules collected from roots of 
nitrogen-fixing plants of the same species to be inoculated. Whichever form is 
used, care should be taken when handling nitrogen-fixing bacteria inoculants 
because they are very perishable. These soil bacteria live underground in 
moist, dark conditions with relatively stable, cool temperatures. Similar 
conditions should be maintained to ensure the viability of inoculants during 
storage, handling, and application.</p> 
<p>Pure culture inoculants of nitrogen-fixing bacteria usually come in small 
packets of finely ground peat moss (Figure 10.41A). Some manufactured 
inoculants contain select strains, tested for forming optimally productive 
partnerships with their host species. Select inoculant should be used if it can 
be obtained; these contain optimal partners for the species they were matched 
for, providing a good supply of nitrogen at a low cost to the plant. 
Manufactured products usually come with application instructions; these should 
be followed. In general, about 100 grams of cultured inoculant is usually 
sufficient to inoculate up to 3,000 seedlings in nursery conditions. Because 
they contain living cultures of bacteria, these inoculants are perishable and 
should be kept in cool, dark conditions, such as inside a refrigerator.</p> 
<p>A.</p> 
<p>B.</p> 
<p><b>Figure 10.41 &mdash; </b>Nitrogen-fixing bacteria are commercially 
available as pure culture inoculant, often in a carrier (A), or can be prepared 
by collecting nodules off of plants from the wild (B). Photos by Tara Luna.</p> 
<p>Peat-based inoculants are added to chlorine-free water to create a liquid 
slurry (Allowing a bucket of tap water to stand uncovered for 24 hours is a 
good way to let chlorine evaporate).If a blender is available, using it to 
blend some inoculant in water is a very good practice to ensure the bacteria 
will be evenly mixed in the solution. If a blender is not available, a mortar 
can be used. Five to ten grams (about 0.2&mdash;0.4 ounce) of manufactured 
inoculant can inoculate about 500 seedlings, usually exceeding the recommended 
100,000 bacteria per seedling. Once seedlings begin to nodulate, nodules from 
their roots can serve as the basis for making crude inoculant as described 
below. This way, inoculant need only be purchased once for each plant species 
grown, and thereafter, crude inoculant can be made from nodules.</p> 
<p>Preparing Crude Inoculant &mdash; Crude inoculant is made using nodules, 
the small root structures that house the bacteria. Each one of the nodules can 
house millions of bacteria. For<em>Rhizobium</em>, a brown, pink, or red color 
inside is usually a good indicator that the millions of bacteria in the nodule 
are actively fixing nitrogen. For<em>Frankia</em>, desirable nodules will be 
white or yellow inside. Grey or green nodules should be avoided, as they are 
likely inactive.</p> 
<p>To make your own crude inoculant, select healthy, vigorous plants of the 
same species as the plants to be inoculated. Expose some of the root system of 
a nodulating plant in the nursery or field (Figure 10.41B). If available, 
choose seedlings that were inoculated with select bacteria. Young roots often 
contain the most active nodules. Search for nodules with the proper color and 
pick them off cleanly. If possible, collect nodules from several plants. Put 
nodules in a plastic bag or container and place them in a cooler for protection 
from direct sunlight and heat. As soon as possible after collection (within a 
few hours), put the nodules in a blender with clean, chlorine-free water. About 
50-100 nodules blended in a liter of water is enough to inoculate about 500 
seedlings. This solution is a homemade liquid inoculant, ready to apply in the 
same method as cultured inoculant as described below.</p> 
<p><b>Figure 10.42 &mdash;</b> After successful inoculation, nitrogen-fixing 
bacteria will multiply on the root system as plants grow. The arrow points to a 
visibleFrankia nodule on an alnus seedling. Photo by Tara Luna.</p> 
<p><b>Inset 10.10 &mdash; How Does Biological Nitrogen Fixation Work?</b></p> 
<p>The symbiotic partnership between plants and their nitrogen-fixing 
microsymbionts works this way: The bacteria live in nodules on roots of the 
plant. Each nodule contains millions of the bacteria that accumulate 
atmospheric nitrogen and share this nitrogen with the plant. In exchange, the 
plant provides energy in the form of carbohydrates to the bacteria.</p> 
<p>The bacteria must come in contact with the root systems early in the 
plant's life, ideally within the first 2 to 6 weeks of growth. For 
nursery-grown materials, nitrogen-fixing bacteria must be introduced in the 
nursery. For direct field sowing of seed, inoculants should be applied as the 
seeds are being sown.</p> 
<p>When the &quot;nitrogen-fixing&quot; plant sheds its leaves, dies, or dies 
back, the nitrogen stored in the plant's tissues is cycled to other plants and 
through the ecosystem. This process, part of the nitrogen cycle, is the major 
source of nitrogen fertility in most natural ecosystems.</p> 
<p>Applying Inoculant &mdash; Inoculant must be applied in a timely fashion, 
when seedlings are just emerging, usually within 2 weeks of sowing. This helps 
ensure successful nodulation and maximizes the benefits of using inoculants. 
Therefore inoculant must be introduced in the nursery for nursery-grown plant 
materials, or introduced at the time of sowing for seeds that are sown directly 
at the field site. One liter of liquefied inoculant made from either nodules or 
cultured inoculant as per the instructions above is diluted in more 
chlorine-free water. For 500 seedlings, about 5 liters of water is used. This 
solution is then watered into the root system of each seedling using a watering 
can. In the field, for direct seeding applications, the slurry of commercial or 
crude inoculant can be added to the hydroseeder tank and mixed in with seed 
mixes.</p> 
<h4>10.1.7.9 Management Considerations for Nitrogen-Fixing Inoculations</h4> 
<p>Verifying the Nitrogen-Fixing Partnership &mdash; Allow two to six weeks 
for noticeable signs that the plant has formed a symbiotic partnership with 
nitrogen-fixing bacteria. Signs include:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Seedlings begin to grow well and are deep green despite the absence of 
added nitrogen fertilizer,</li> 
<li>The root systems give off a faint but distinctive ammonia-like scent, </li>
<li>Nodules are usually visible on the root system after about four to six 
weeks (Figure 10.42), and nodules are pink, red, or brown (for<em>Rhizobium</em>
), or yellow or white (for<em>Frankia</em>).</li> </ul> 
<p>Post-Planting Care &mdash; Several factors are of primary concern when 
using inoculants for nitrogen-fixing bacteria:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Fertilization. The use of nitrogen-fixing bacterial inoculant requires 
some adjustments in fertilization. Excessive nitrogen fertilizer will inhibit 
formation of the partnership.</li> 
<li>Water quality. Excessive chlorine in water is detrimental to Rhizobium and 
Frankia. The water source may need to be tested and a chlorine filter used if 
excessive chlorine is a problem.</li> 
<li>Micronutrients and soil quality. Some nutrients are necessary to 
facilitate nodulation, including calcium, potassium, molybdenum, and iron. 
Excessively compacted soils, extremes of pH or temperature also inhibit 
nodulation.</li> </ul> 
<h4>10.1.7.10 Other Beneficial Microorganisms</h4> 
<p>In nature, communities of bacteria, fungi, algae, protozoa, and other 
microorganisms in the soil make nutrients available to plants, create channels 
for water and air, maintain soil structure, and cycle nutrients and organic 
matter. A healthy population of soil microorganisms can also maintain 
ecological balance, preventing the onset of major problems from viruses or 
other pathogens that reside in the soil. The practice of protecting and 
re-establishing beneficial microorganisms is a key one for revegetation. As a 
science, however, the use of beneficial microorganisms is in its infancy. 
Although thousands of species of microorganisms have been recognized and named, 
the number of unknown species is estimated to be in the millions. Almost every 
time microbiologists examine a soil sample, they discover a previously unknown 
species (Margulis and others, 1997). Revegetation specialists should keep an 
eye on developments in this field and see how their plants can benefit from new 
insights into the roles of microorganisms. Conserving and utilizing healthy 
topsoil will also help to sustain the natural populations of beneficial 
microorganisms.</p> 
<p>Back to Top</p> 
<h3>10.1.8 Topographic Enhancements</h3> 
<h4>10.1.8.1 Introduction</h4> 
<p>Topographic enhancements are alterations to the roadside landscape designed 
to improve the growing environment for plants. Topographic enhancements should 
be considered when site resources such as topsoil, organic matter, and water 
are limited (See Section 5.11, Inventory Site Resources). It is often better to 
concentrate limited resources in key areas where resources can be most 
effective, rather than spread them across the larger project area and dilute 
them to the point of having little benefit to reestablishing native vegetation.
</p> 
<p>Topographic enhancement integrates three components into the roadside 
design &mdash; soil improvement, site stability, and water harvesting (Figure 
10.43). Soil improvement can occur when limited topsoil and organic matter are 
strategically used to create growing areas with optimum rooting depth (See 
Section 5.3 and Section 5.5). Stable landforms are created that reduce surface 
erosion and increase slope stability (See Section 5.6 and Section 5.7). Water 
harvesting can result when local topography is modified to capture runoff water 
and concentrate it in areas where it can be used by plants (See Section 5.2) 
(For background on water harvesting, see Fidelibus and Bainbridge 2006).The 
integration of these three components will determine the success of a 
topographic enhancement design.</p> 
<p>Topographic enhancement strategies must be considered during the initial 
planning stages of road design. These structures will require the input of the 
design engineer and cooperation of the project engineer, and must be built 
during the construction phase of the project. Structural changes to the 
topography following construction are not usually an option for revegetation 
purposes.</p> 
<p>There are many options for topographic enhancement. This discussion is by 
no means exhaustive, but intended to introduce the reader to a variety of 
structures that can be installed during road construction to enhance the 
establishment of native plants.</p> 
<h4>10.1.8.2 Contour Bench Terraces, Planting Pockets, and Microcatchments</h4>
<p>Contour bench terraces are structures carved out of cut or fill slopes that 
capture and store runoff water and sediments from road surfaces, road 
shoulders, and the slopes above. If infiltration rates of soils above the 
terraces are low, runoff will occur, even from low intensity rainfall. Contour 
bench terraces are designed to collect enough water to recharge soils and 
provide sufficient water for plant growth during the summer, but also be 
protected from erosion during peak rainstorm events. Design criteria for 
determining the distance between terraces include slope gradient, rainfall 
intensities, and infiltration rates. Observing erosional patterns on 
unvegetated road cuts near the project site can give an indication of 
approximate spacing for benches (See Section 5.6.8).</p> 
<p><b>Figure 10.43 &mdash;</b> Integrating soil improvement, site stability, 
and water harvesting is critical when designing topographic enhancement 
features.</p> 
<p> Contour bench terraces can be long and contiguous or separate and 
discrete. For long and contiguous terraces, concentrated water from high runoff 
events can flow down the terraces (assuming they are not completely level), 
potentially causing gullies. Placing berms or &quot;plugs&quot; in the terraces 
at frequent intervals can reduce this potential.</p> 
<p>When terraces are filled with growing media (topsoil or amended subsoil) 
and planted, they are referred to as planting pockets (Figure 10.44). Planting 
pockets must have adequate soil depth to store intercepted water and support 
establishment of planted seedlings. The surface of the planting pocket should 
be insloped to capture water and sediment, and the face of the pocket should be 
protected from surface erosion.</p> <br>
<br>
<b>Figure 10.44 &mdash; </b>
Planting pockets collect and store runoff water from areas directly upslope 
during rainstorms (A). Water and sediments collect in the back slope of the 
pocket (B). Moisture fills the soil and moves into fractured bedrock (C) where 
roots have penetrated. The face of the planting pocket is protected by mulch or 
erosion cloth (D). The photograph on the right was taken looking down on a 
planting pocket after a rainstorm. The back slope has ponded water and 
collected sediments from the surface above. <br>

<p> Fill slope microcatchments are structures that capture runoff from 
outsloped road surfaces and compacted shoulders into terraces and berms where 
it can be used for plant growth (Figure 10.45). Microcatchments include a 
storage basin and berm. Berms are typically 4- to 8-inch high obstacles placed 
on the contour. They are formed from soil or woody debris (logs), or 
manufactured products such as straw waddles (Figure 10.45) or compost berms. 
Manufactured products and woody debris are &quot;keyed&quot; (partially buried) 
into the soil surface to prevent water from eroding under the structure. 
Compost berms are continuous mounds of compost that can slow water and filter 
sediments. Seedlings can be planted on, or immediately above, berms or 
obstacles to access captured water. Unless species that propagate vegetatively 
are used in these structures (SeeSection 10.2.2), care must be taken to avoid 
planting where sediment will bury the seedling. The storage basin, created by 
terraces or berms, can be improved for plant growth with soil tillage and 
incorporation of soil amendments.</p> <br>

<p><b>Figure 10.45 &mdash;</b> Fill slope microcatchments take advantage of 
the low infiltration rates of compacted fill slopes (A) by capturing the runoff 
from road drainage at the bottom of the fill into topsoil or amended subsoil 
favorable for plant growth (B). The extra water from these surfaces can support 
trees and shrubs. Straw waddles, as shown in the picture on the right, can be 
used in fill slope microcatchments to collect water and sediment. Straw waddles 
must be installed on the contour and keyed into the soil to be effective.</p> 
<p><b>Figure 10.46 &mdash;</b> Constructed wetlands capture water from 
roadside runoff and filter sediments before water enters perennial streams. 
Constructed wetlands can create favorable habitat for unique flora and fauna.

<h4>10.1.8.3 Runoff Strips and Constructed Wetlands</h4> 
<p>Runoff strips are catchment structures constructed in areas where 
intermittent concentrated road drainage occurs. These are typically at the 
outlets of culverts or in road drainage dips. Runoff strips capture 
concentrated runoff into small ponds or catchment basins. These areas can be 
planted with riparian species, such as willows (<em>Salix</em> spp).and 
cottonwoods (<em>Populus</em> spp.), or wetland species, such as rushes (<em>
Juncus</em> spp).and sedges (<em>Carex</em> spp.). Runoff strips are placed in 
draws or concave topography and are composed of engineered impoundment 
barriers, using riprap, logs, or gabion baskets, that store water from runoff 
events. The barrier must have a spillway (a low point in the structure) and be 
keyed into the sides to assure that concentrated water does not erode around 
its sides. Where runoff strips are on gentle gradients, constructed wetlands 
may possibly be developed (Figure 10.46).</p> 
<h4>10.1.8.4 Planting Islands</h4> 
<p>Planting islands are used where deep-rooted tree and shrub species are 
desired, but topsoil, soil amendments, or soil depth are limiting. They are 
designed into such revegetation projects as obliterated roads, view corridors, 
waste areas, and other highly disturbed sites. The strategy behind planting 
islands is to create an ideal growing environment for tree and shrub seedlings 
that replicates the natural patterns or features observed in the surrounding 
landscape and plant communities (Figure 10.47).</p> 
<p><b>Figure 10.47 &mdash;</b> Most planting islands are designed to mimic the 
natural surrounding environment of the project site. In this photograph, 
seedlings were planted in clumps to mimic the small islands of trees that grew 
in this geographic area. The inter-island areas were planted with lower growing 
grasses, forbs, and shrubs.</p> 
<p><b>Figure 10.48 &mdash;</b> Illustration of a typical cross-section of a 
planting island where soil depth is enhanced for tree establishment. 
Inter-island areas are planted to shrubs and grasses.</p> 
<p>Islands can be created by excavating an appropriate area to a depth of 
several feet and backfilling with either topsoil or compost-amended material 
(Figure 10.48). Alternatively, compost and other soil amendments (including 
lime and fertilizers) can be spread over planting islands at the depth needed 
to amend the soil profile and mixed thoroughly through the islands with an 
excavator or backhoe. Soil compaction must be avoided in these operations or 
during any subsequent operation. After planting, mulch can be applied across 
the surface of the entire island.</p> 
<p>In Figure 10.48, compost is mixed to a depth of 3 feet by an excavator in 
irregular shaped planting islands. The islands are planted with conifers and 3 
inches of mulch are applied to entire islands to keep them free of competing 
vegetation. The layout of planting islands should be designed with a vision of 
how the vegetation will appear once established, and should be based on 
recovered and undisturbed reference sites. Planting islands will generally 
occupy less than a quarter to a third of the entire site, leaving the remainder 
as &quot;inter-island.&quot; The inter-islands will be much less productive 
than the planting islands. Grass and forb plant communities are therefore more 
suited to these areas.</p> 
<h4>10.1.8.5 Biotechnical Engineering Structures</h4> 
<p>Topographic enhancement also includes many biotechnical engineering 
structures, such as vegetated retaining walls, brush layers, and live pole 
drains. Incorporating soil improvement strategies into these structures will 
stabilize the soil and capture runoff water, making them very suitable to the 
establishment of a range of native vegetation (SeeSection 10.3.3 and Section 
10.3.4). </p>
