<p><b><strong>Mulching</strong></b> consists in laying an organic cover around 
plants (usuallystraw). This technique has many advantages for the gardener as 
well as for the environment. The main ones being the ground remains moist as it 
prevents evaporation and saves frequent watering, this means less water wasted 
but also lessweeds that would hinder germination. </p>

<h2>[edit]  Advantages </h2> 
<p>Laying organic wastes as mulch enables the gardener to  recycle them. The 
mulch will decay and rot, providing humus to the soil&nbsp;; thanks to these 
natural nutrients, chemical ones are useless so it's also a means to contribute 
to the preservation of microfauna.</p> 
<p>Besides being environment friendly, this technique also has advantages for 
the gardener who saves time&nbsp;: no need to weed, hoe or till, thus less soil 
erosion. It also saves money as less water is needed, no fertilizers and no 
need to take organicwastes to the local dump. </p> 
<h2>[edit]  Setting </h2> 
<p>Before setting the mulch, the soil should be hoed about 5 inches deep. The 
mulch can be set any time of the year except in Winter, this can be done 
manually or using a trowel for tiny patches so as to lay an even cover about 4 
to 5 inches thick. It's better not to form little heaps around the plants to 
avoid an excess of moisture.</p> 
<h2>[edit]  Materials </h2> 
<p>Many vegetal species can be used as mulch but the cover can also be 
composed of synthetic material. It's always better to use local species rather 
than imported materials from tropical plants such as cacao pods which are much 
more expensive. Components derived from conifers provoke acidification, so 
they're not suitable for all plants but are good for heath plants.</p> 
<h2>[edit]  Double mulch </h2> 
<p>Double mulch combines the benefits of two complementary mulches, e.g. dead 
leaves create humus but will easily be blown by the wind so covering these with 
homecompost will protect this first layer. </p> 
<h2>[edit]  Ramial Chipped Wood (RCW) </h2> <br>
perennials covered with RCW. 
<p>Ramial Chipped Wood (RCW) is the name given to chipped branches of 
deciduous trees of less than 3 inches in diameter, pinales can be mixed, up to 
20%. These branches or very young trees that compose RCW are the richest part 
of the tree, they contain 75% of the minerals, amino acids, proteins and 
catalysts. By extension, RCW also refers to innovative agricultural methods, 
the use of chipped wood as an upper layer or as mulch will recreate a 
&quot;forest floor&quot;. RCW helps pedogenesis which is necessary to the 
formation of humus. The use of RCW is considered as essential for organic 
farming and  sustainable farming and to fight desertification. </p>
