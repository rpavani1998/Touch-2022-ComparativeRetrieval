<p>One of the most beneficial and affordable treatments for your garden is 
mulch. It's available in many forms, from shredded wood and bark nuggets to 
rubber and stone. When mulch is spread out in a 2-4-inch layer on top of a 
garden bed, it will protect against erosion, help prevent pests from invading 
and conserve moisture, saving you time and money spent on repairs to your 
garden later. Mulch in various forms can also be used to<em>Create a Soft Path
</em> or an affordable patio area, help keep weeds at bay and finish the area 
under trees where most plants can't grow. For more tips on fending off weeds, 
check out<em>Easy Weed Management for your Flower Beds</em>.</p>

 Jan. 12, 2011 05:23PM <b>Martha, Straw makes a good mulch 
because, unlike hay, it is usually pretty weed-free. Spread it 3 to 4 inches 
deep to keep down weeds and help conserve soil moisture. In the vegetable 
garden, it works best to spread mulch after planting. In a perennial flower 
garden, spread it just after the plants come up in the spring. You can put in 
down around trees and shrubs at any time.</b> <br>

Cathleen, The best mulch to use is an organic mulch that will break down and 
add nutrients to your soil. Your yews may need to be replanted after improving 
the soil by mixing in bagged compost and soil conditioner, but afterwards, 
mulching with compost or chopped leaves and topping that with something like 
pine straw or NatureScapes will give you an attractive bed that will improve 
your soil.<br>

 Jun. 03, 2010 03:36PM <b>Laura, It's a 
compromise. Wood chips break down more quickly, but provide nutrients faster. 
Bark is slow to decompose and doesn't need to be applied as often. One 
compromise is to chop the fallen leaves with a lawnmower in the fall, put them 
down, and top with bark or pine straw. That way, the trees get the nutrients 
they need, and I don't need to constantly replace mulch.</b> <br>

 Jun. 03, 2010 02:53PM  Two years ago we had an arborist come care

provide enough nutrients to the soil, that wood chips would be better. This 
does make sense to me as the wood chips are the whole tree. We need to re-apply 
this year and I want to use what's best for the soil. I also have two little

Aug. 10, 2009 03:07PM <b>@ Carolyn You could create terraced gardens, which are 
flat-topped sections running across the hillside. You could also create a rain 
garden by digging a shallow bowl for the water to collect in. Then plant 
water-loving plants in it. Or, you could accept that you have a natural 
drainage ditch and fill it with a jumble of large stones that will slow the 
water down as it passes through.</b> <br>

2009 03:06PM <b>@ Georgiana Thanks for your comment. Any organic mulch, such as 
shredded bark, should be fine. No matter what type you choose, keep it a few 
inches away from the trunk. This helps minimize disease and insect problems, 
since mulch holds moisture and that's what pests like.</b> <br>

Cactus need very good drainage, especially at the soil line. If they're growing 
in nice, sandy soil they probably don't need any mulch at all. But if you 
choose to use one, make sure it's one that drains, like stone, rather than one 
that holds moisture, like wood and bark mulches.</b> <br>

<br>  Aug. 10, 2009 03:04PM <b>@ Linda Pine straw is made up of pine needles. 
Because they decompose relatively slowly, they won't appreciably acidify the 
soil, although it's a good idea to test your soil pH every few years because 
plant roots and heavy rains tend to make soils more acidic over time.</b> <br>

 Aug. 10, 2009 03:02PM <b>@ Robert Thanks for your 
comment. To be on the safe side, it's best to keep mulch away from building 
foundations. Insects like the dark, moist conditions that mulch creates. So 
make sure downspouts carry water away from the foundation, and that the ground 
is sloped so water runs away from your home.</b> <br>

<br>  Aug. 10, 2009 03:01PM <b>@ Frank Thanks for your comment. Probably the 
biggest difference is that natural materials, like bark mulch and pine straw, 
slowly break down and as they decompose they add nutrients to the soil. Stone 
and rubber mulch don't break down &ndash;&ndash;meaning they last longer (you 
don't have to replenish them as often) but they don't improve the soil.</b> <br>

 Aug. 09, 2009 10:15PM  Shirley: It's usually a vine 
with three leaves - &quot;leaves of three, let them be!&quot; The oil doesn't 
die, even if the plant dies. If it gets on your clothing all you can do it 
throw your clothes away. The oil will not wash out. The oil can be carried to 
humans by our pets if they rub on it. It's pretty bad stuff!<br>

 Aug. 07, 2009 09:35AM  Our village has a monthly brush pick up and 
makes the mulch available to residents. Its a mixed bag of what you'll get but 
makes a good base. A top layer from Home Depot gives a consistent and beautiful 
look. Its a way to get started and leaves you extra money for plantings.<br>

have a small woods with lots of brush which includes poison ivy and oak. I 
wonder if anyone could give me some advice on how to kill the poison?<br>

 Aug. 06, 2009 03:21PM  In regards to mulch attracting bugs, I 
have found bugs are found in the soil whether you add mulch or not. On the 
other hand if you add mulch to your soil you may have bugs but minus the weeds.

 Aug. 06, 2009 02:48PM  I'm surprised no one here 
has taken a moment to discourage others from using cypress mulch given the 
devastating impact its harvest has on delicate ecosystems in the south. Please 
use more eco-friendly alternatives, or else our children and grandchildren may 
have no idea what a cypress tree is.<br>

11:10AM Carolyn, Your soil erosion will always be helped by a network of roots 
holding it together. That is why the erosion stops where the grass meets. I 
think your best bet for a slope is either terracing it or filling it in with a 
mass of plants like daylilies, ornamental grasses, black-eyed susan, etc. The 
closer the better.<br>

backyard slopes. Over time, erosion created a 6 in. deep and 6 in. wide 
&quot;canal&quot; where the grass meets the flower beds. This year I inserted 
huge rocks at 18 in. intervals before adding hardwood mulch. They stopped about 
an inch below the surface so that I could cover them with mulch. The mulch is 
being washed away again. I don't want to wind up with a Grand Canyon. Any 
suggestions? Carol<br>

<br>  Aug. 05, 2009 10:46PM  I have heard that wood mulch is not good for 
cactus, what would be? I have heard that stones are good for cactus, but I have 
also heard that they get hot and helps dry out the soil. I only do container 
gardening, the cypress mulch is recommended for that purpose, how deep in the 
pots?<br>

 Aug. 05, 2009 10:32PM  I have always heard of 
pine straw, but what is it? Is it just pine needles or is it shredded wood? 
Will it acidify the soil?<br>

I've heard that some mulches attract bugs such as carpenter ants, termites, 
etc. Which can be a problem next to buildings and homes. Is pine mulch in that 
category?<br>
