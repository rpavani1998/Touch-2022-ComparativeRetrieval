<b>Abstract:</b>&nbsp;Environmental impacts associated with the building 
industry have become of increasing importance. Materials and energy consumed 
during manufacture of building materials such as lumber affect a 
building&rsquo;s environmental performance. This study determined environmental 
impacts of manufacturing hardwood lumber in the southeastern US using the 
life-cycle inventory method. Primary data were collected and then 
weight-averaged on a per-unit basis of 1.0 m3, of planed dry lumber (600 
oven-dry kg/m3) to find material flows and energy use. Cumulative allocated 
energy consumption for manufacturing 1.0 m3 planed dry lumber from 2.44 m3 of 
incoming logs was 5.86 GJ/m3 with 66% from wood fuel. Emission data produced 
through modeling estimated total biomass and fossil carbon dioxide production 
of 424 and 131 kg/m3, respectively, considering all impacts. A cubic meter of 
planed dry hardwood lumber stores 1.17 Mg CO2 equivalents as a final product. 
The amount of carbon stored in hardwood lumber exceeds fossil carbon emissions 
by a factor of nine. Therefore, as long as hardwood lumber and its carbon stay 
in products held in end uses, carbon stored will exceed fossil carbon emitted 
in manufacturing.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>
&nbsp;Net cleaning value is the economic value added to the wastepaper pulp by 
removing the contaminants, corrected for the fiber lost tothe rejects, minus 
the cost of the energy consumed in the separation process. This study was 
undertaken to determine whether changing the geometry of a 152-mm-diameter disc 
surface from that of a flat surface to one having a concave indentation would 
improve the net cleaning due. Hot-melt adhesive contaminant was removed from a 
simulated pulp furnish composedof corrugated fiberboard. At optimum operating 
condtions, a net cleaning due of $129/metric ton was obtained for a flat disc, 
compared to a measured $l25/meuic ton for the indented disc. The energy saved 
from the reduced speed requirement for the indented disc was more than offset 
by an increase in fiber loss, from 5.9% for the flat disc to 9.9% for the 
indented disc. Contaminant removal was slightly higher for the indented disc<br>

<b>Abstract:
</b>&nbsp;Mould growth on coated wood is today a genuine challenge for house 
owners. Environmentally sound wooden facades with long service lives and 
acceptable appearance are desired. The objective in this study was to 
investigate the accumulated mould growth on 13 different wood substrates with 3 
surface coating systems by identifying the factors that contribute to the 
variation and to predict future performance. A generalized linear mixed model 
was fit to the data with the analysis showing that coating and exposure time 
both had highly significant influences on mould growth. Further, wood substrate 
was significant, but comparatively less than coating and exposure time. A 
smaller coefficient for mould coverage in the beginning of the exposure period 
gave the panels with one of the coating systems, BAP, a delay in mould growth, 
and the extrapolated values for years 6-12 indicate a longer aesthetic service 
life than panels with the two other coating systems. Coated heartwood as wood 
type was less susceptible to mould growth than coated mixed wood and coated 
sapwood. Acetylated pine as wood substrate and aspen as wood species had lower 
resistance to mould growth than the other wood substrates and wood species, 
respectively.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>
&nbsp;Carbon is continuously cycled among Harvested wood products (HWP) in use, 
HWP in solid waste disposal sites and between forest ecosystems and the 
atmosphere as a result of biological processes in forests (e.g., 
photosynthesis, respiration, growth, mortality, decomposition, and disturbances 
such as fires or pest outbreaks) and anthropogenic activities (e.g., 
harvesting, thinning, clearing, and replanting). As trees photosynthesize and 
grow, Carbon is removed from the atmosphere and stored in living tree biomass. 
As trees die and otherwise deposit litter and debris on the forest floor, C is 
released to the atmosphere or transferred to the soil by organisms that 
facilitate decomposition. Net changes in all forest-related land, including 
non-forest land converted to forest and forests converted to non-forest, are 
being reported here.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>&nbsp;To assess 
availability and sustainable use of forest biomass for the United States, we 
suggest accepting the &ldquo;Brundtland report&rdquo; (<i>1</i>) view of 
sustainable development. This report defines sustainability in relation to 
satisfying human needs though sustainable development:<i>Humanity has the 
ability to make development sustainable&ndash;to ensure that it meets the needs 
of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet 
their own needs. The concept of sustainable development does imply 
limits&ndash;not absolute limits but limitations imposed by the present state 
of technology and social organization on environmental resources and by the 
ability of the biosphere to absorb the effects of human activities</i>. This 
definition indicates that sustainability needs to account for (1) human needs, 
current and future, (2) limitations in meeting these needs based on 
technological capabilities, social organzation, and environmental resources, 
and (3) the ability of the biosphere to absorb the effects of human activities.

<b>Abstract:</b>
&nbsp;Building products have come under increased scrutiny because of 
environmental impacts from their manufacture. Our study followed the life cycle 
inventory approach for prefinished engineered wood flooring in the eastern US 
and compared the results with those of solid strip wood flooring. Our study 
surveyed five engineered wood flooring manufacturers in the eastern US. These 
production facilities represented 18.7% of total annual production in 2007. 
Primary data collected for 2007 included annual production, energy consumption 
and type, material inputs, emission data, product outputs, and other 
coproducts. Modeling data estimated biogenic and fossil CO2 emissions at 623 
and 1050 kg/m3, respectively, and volatile organic compounds at 1.04 kg/m3. 
Cumulative allocated energy consumption for prefinished engineered wood 
flooring was 23.0 GJ/m3 with 40% coming from coal. Unfinished solid strip 
flooring cumulative energy consumption was only 6.50 GJ/m3 with 65% from 
biomass, roughly half that of unfinished engineered wood flooring. However, 
after converting to an area (in-use) basis, unfinished engineered wood flooring 
consumed 136 MJ/m2 compared with 123 MJ/m2 for unfinished solid strip flooring. 
After changing to an in-use parameter, the two wood flooring products were 
similar in energy consumption during manufacturing, but engineered wood 
flooring still consumed significantly more fossil fuel.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>&nbsp;Public and private research focused 
on wood utilization and product development in the United States is an 
important source of innovation required for sustaining the worldwide 
competitive position of the wood-based industry. In 2008 an estimated 400 to 
500 wood utilization research projects were implemented by 150 to 200 federal, 
state and private entities. Investments in publically implemented projects were 
in the range of $110 to $120 million, while, by some estimates, investments in 
projects sponsored by private concerns exceeded $2.5 billion in the same year 
(Ellefson and others 2010). Although reviews of research investments such as 
these have been made at various times in the past, there continues to be an 
interest in how the research community might better organize and manage its 
efforts to improve the use of research-produced technologies (National Research 
Council 2002). The very nature of the subject makes review and evaluation 
difficult.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>
&nbsp;Public and private research focused on wood utilization and product 
development in the United States is an important source of innovation required 
for sustaining the worldwide competitive position of the wood-based industry. 
Because of the research community&rsquo;s diversity, the exact magnitude of 
investment in wood utilization research is subject for much conjecture. 
However, in 2008 an estimated 400 to 500 wood utilization research projects 
were implemented by 150 to 200 federal, state and private entities. Investments 
in publically implemented projects were in the range of $110 to $120 million, 
while, by some estimates, investments in projects sponsored by private concerns 
exceeded $2.5 billion in the same year. Scientists and supporting staff engaged 
by public research organizations was in the range of 900 to 1,000 in 2008. For 
research conducted by private concerns, scientists and engineers approached 
8,000 in number. To experienced administrators, conditions necessary for a 
successful research enterprise focused on wood utilization and product 
development include clarity in purpose and well-defined client groups, 
effective governing boards and advisory committees, visionary and enthusiastic 
administrators, talented and risk taking scientists, satisfied research clients 
and customers, and research contributions that add to the scientific foundation 
considered necessary to enhance the efficient use of wood.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>&nbsp;Using 
forests to mitigate climate change has gained much interest in science and 
policy discussions. We examine the evidence for carbon benefits, environmental 
and monetary costs, risks and trade-offs for a variety of activities in three 
general strategies: (1) land use change to increase forest area (afforestation) 
and avoid deforestation; (2) carbon management in existing forests; and (3) the 
use of wood as biomass energy, in place of other building materials, or in wood 
products for carbon storage. We found that many strategies can increase forest 
sector carbon mitigation above the current 162-256 Tg C/yr, and that many 
strategies have co-benefits such as biodiversity, water, and economic 
opportunities. Each strategy also has trade-offs, risks, and uncertainties 
including possible leakage, permanence, disturbances, and climate change 
effects. Because &sim;60% of the carbon lost through deforestation and 
harvesting from 1700 to 1935 has not yet been recovered and because some 
strategies store carbon in forest products or use biomass energy, the 
biological potential for forest sector carbon mitigation is large. Several 
studies suggest that using these strategies could offset as much as 10-20% of 
current U.S. fossil fuel emissions. To obtain such large offsets in the United 
States would require a combination of afforesting up to one-third of cropland 
or pastureland, using the equivalent of about one-half of the gross annual 
forest growth for biomass energy, or implementing more intensive management to 
increase forest growth on one-third of forestland. Such large offsets would 
require substantial trade-offs, such as lower agricultural production and 
non-carbon ecosystem services from forests. The effectiveness of activities 
could be diluted by negative leakage effects and increasing disturbance 
regimes. Because forest carbon loss contributes to increasing climate risk and 
because climate changemay impede regeneration following disturbance, avoiding 
deforestation and promoting regeneration after disturbance should receive high 
priority as policy considerations. Policies to encourage programs or projects 
that influence forest carbon sequestration and offset fossil fuel emissions 
should also consider major items such as leakage, the cyclical nature of forest 
growth and regrowth, and the extensive demand for and movement of forest 
products globally, and other greenhouse gas effects, such as methane and 
nitrous oxide emissions, and recognize other environmental benefits of forests, 
such as biodiversity, nutrient management, and watershed protection. Activities 
that contribute to helping forests adapt to the effects of climate change, and 
which also complement forest carbon storage strategies, would be prudent.<br>

to innovation within all organizations. The intent of this paper is to take 
stock of the conceptual underpinnings of technology transfer processes as they 
relate to wood utilization research and to identify conditions that promote the 
successful transfer of research results. Conceptually, research utilization can 
be viewed from multiple perspectives, including the haphazard diffusion of 
knowledge in response to vague and imprecise demands for information, scanning 
of multiple information sources by individuals and organizations searching for 
useful scientific knowledge, engagement of third parties to organize research 
results and communicate them to potential users, and ongoing and active 
collaboration between researchers and potential users of research. Empirical 
evidence suggests that various types of programs can promote technology 
transfer (venture capital, angel investors, business incubators, extension 
services, tax incentives, and in-house entites), the fundamental effectiveness 
of which depends on research results that are scientifically valid and 
consistent with the information needs of potential users. Furthermore, evidence 
suggests preference toward programs that are appropriately organized and 
governed, suitably led and creatively administered, and periodically evaluated 
in accordance with clear standards of success.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>
&nbsp;Land-use change and forestry is the major category featuring carbon 
sequestration in the annual US Greenhouse Gas Inventory, required by the United 
Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. We describe the National 
Greenhouse Gas Inventory and present the sources of our data and methods and 
the most recent results. Forests and forest products in the United States 
sequestered more than -790 million metric tn of CO2 equivalent in 2008, on 253 
million ha of forestland. This estimate represents a net increase in carbon, 
including effects of growth, harvests, or other disturbances of forest 
ecosystems, as well as carbon stored in harvested wood products. Both area and 
carbon density of these forestlands have increased since 1990, the first year 
estimates are required. Currently, 89% of net annual sequestration is in the 
forest ecosystem, and the balance is net carbon addition to harvested wood 
products.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>&nbsp;A 
global rebound of pulp, paper and paperboard markets began soon after the 
global financial crisis in 2008-2009. It has continued and we are now seeing 
more robust market conditions in 2010 and early 2011. Marketing strategies 
evolved as pulp and paper producers of the UNECE region were faced with dual 
challenges of limited growth, or decline, in European and North American 
consumption and expanded global competition. One such strategy is evident in 
the increased emphasis on the contributions of the pulp and paper industry to 
the green economy.<br>

<b>Abstract:
</b>&nbsp;Demand for woody feedstock is increasing, motivated by public 
policies that have set ambitious targets for renewable energy: for instance, 
the EU&prime;s aim of meeting 20% of its overall energy requirement from 
renewable sources by 2020 and, to a certain extent, the renewable portfolio 
standards in Canada and the US. Financial support to improve the 
cost-competitiveness of wood energy with fossil fuels will be instrumental to 
sustaining growth in the sector. The spike in oil prices in 2011 has provided a 
further rationale for choosing wood rather than fossil fuels.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>&nbsp;The U.S. Forest 
Products Module (USFPM) is a partial market equilibrium model of the U.S. 
forest sector that operates within the Global Forest Products Model (GFPM) to 
provide long-range timber market projections in relation to global economic 
scenarios. USFPM was designed specifically for the 2010 RPA forest assessment, 
but it is being used also in other applications. Within the GFPM framework of 
global forest product markets and trade, USFPM models aggregate U.S. forest 
product demands and regional forest product production, timber harvest, and 
timber stumpage markets in three U.S. subregions: North, South, and West. In 
each subregion, USFPM models timber stumpage markets for four categories of 
timber, including hardwood and softwood sawtimber and hardwood and softwood 
non-sawtimber. USFPM models regional timber harvest and transport activities as 
the conversion of timber stumpage supplies into delivered timber product 
outputs (sawlogs/veneer logs, pulpwood/composite timber, other industrial 
roundwood, and fuelwood) plus logging residues. USFPM also adds more complete 
product detail in U.S. regions, by differentiating hardwood lumber and softwood 
lumber, OSB structural panels and industrial particleboard, and hardwood and 
softwood plywood. In addition, USFPM models potential future supplies of 
agricultural short-rotation woody crops (SRWC) for energy and fiber, along with 
wood residue byproducts of sawmills and plywood mills, and the utilization of 
those materials in production of pulp, wood panels, and energy. USFPM thus 
models all forms of wood biomass feedstock that could be used potentially for 
future energy production in the United States, including fuelwood harvest, 
other roundwood, mill residues, agricultural SRWC, and logging residues. This 
report describes the structure of USFPM in detail and presents some examples of 
results and conclusions about future trends in wood energy demands and U.S. 
timber markets based on USFPM and GFPM projections. A key finding is that 
projected future trends in U.S. consumption, production, and net trade in 
forest products are heavily influenced by assumptions about future expansion in 
U.S. and global wood energy demands. The projected effects of expansion in U.S. 
and global wood energy consumption are to dampen growth in forest product 
consumption (because of price impacts on demands) but also to provide greater 
comparative advantages and enhanced net exports for U.S. producers of forest 
products (because of price impacts on foreign producers). Prodigious expansion 
in wood energy demands could cause significant escalation in real U.S. timber 
prices, but on the other hand, real U.S. timber stumpage prices are not 
projected to increase without fairly substantial increases in wood energy 
consumption.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>&nbsp;Transparent and 
credible environmental labeling of productsis vital for a sustainable future. 
Ecolabeling shows information on the environmental performance of 
products,processes, and services. This article focuses on one type of 
ecolabeling referred to as environmental product declarations (EPDs) that 
provide environmental impact information based on life cycle assessment (LCA) 
data. Businesses and consumers who are not familiar with life cycle analysis 
can use LCA-based EPDs for comparison between competing products, much like 
using nutritional labels. In addition, this article describes the process of 
developing EPDs from LCA data in conjunction with product category rules and 
the status and future needs of EPDs in the U.S. forest products industry.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>&nbsp;The wise use of the world&prime;s forest 
resources to satisfy present and future needs of an ever-increasing world 
population is ultimately the goal of all resource management activities. 
Increasing the extent, frequency, and reliability of systems to monitor global 
natural resources is one important aspect of meeting this goal. Another equally 
important aspect of monitoring world resources is increasing the extent, 
frequency, and reliability of systems to monitor present and future demands on 
the forest resource and how these demands impact the resource. Understanding 
and monitoring both the supply of and demand for natural resources are 
essential in meeting our objectives as world resource managers. This paper 
reviews past and present demand estimates in the United States for forest 
resources, the methods used to develop these demand estimates, and their 
associated statistical reliability. The adequacy of these estimates to meet 
informational needs of resource managers and the implications for forest 
managment are evaluated. Recommendations are also made for future monitoring of 
resource demands.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>
&nbsp;Solid wood timber products provide important raw materials to the 
construction, manufacturing, and shipping sectors of the U.S. economy. Nearly 
all new single-family houses and low-rise multifamily residential structures 
are wood framed and sheathed. Large amounts of solid wood timber products are 
also used in the construction of new nonresidential buildings, and in the 
upkeep and improvement of existing structures. Solid wood is used extensively 
in various manufactured products, and a large share of manufactured products is 
shipped on wooden pallets.<br>

<b>Abstract:
</b>&nbsp;Furniture, fixtures and millwork manufacturers (Chart-Furniture 
Industry Groupings) are an important wood-using segment of U.S. manufacturing. 
They consumed 628 million cubic feet (ft3) of wood products, or 35 percent of 
all wood products used in manufacturing in 1977, according to the latest 
industry-wide survey (Table 1) (McKeever and Martens, 1983). Of this 628 
million ft3, 70 percent was lumber, 17 percent particleboard and medium density 
fiberboard, 9 percent plywood and veneer, 3 percent insulation board, and 1 
percent hardboard. Wood consumption increased nearly 85 percent between 1960 
and 1977, compared to an increase of 55 percent for all manufacturing over the 
same period.<br>

<b>Abstract:
</b>&nbsp;Biomass gasification is an approach to producing energy and/or 
biofuels that could be integrated into existing forest product production 
facilities, particularly at pulp mills. Existing process heat and power loads 
tend to favor integration at existing pulp mills. This paper describes a 
generic modeling system for evaluating integrated biomass gasification business 
concepts over a range of production scales and process options, including 
process models and a discounted cash-flow model, all of which are contained in 
a Microsoft&reg; (Redmond, Washington) Office Excel workbook (available from 
the authors). The process models encompass biomass preparation, gasification, 
heat recovery, and syngas cleanup, along with the options of converting syngas 
to biofuel feedstocks via a Fischer-Tropsch gas-to-liquid (GTL) process, the 
use of syngas or GTL tail gas for process heat energy, and the option of added 
process energy equipment, including turbines and generators. The cash-flow 
model computes measures of financial performance for incremental investment in 
gasification business concepts, including net present value and internal rate 
of return. We also describe stochastic simulation methods for financial risk 
assessment, and we present results of sensitivity analysis and stochastic 
simulation for investment in a biomass-to-liquid-fuel concept at an existing 
pulp mill, based on plausible but hypothetical process data and stochastic 
price projections. The results, as reinforced by the sensitivity analysis and 
risk assessment, suggest an investment may be attractive from a financial 
standpoint.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>&nbsp;Industrial timber 
use has provided timber revenue that has helped make timber supply and demand 
more sustainable in the leading timber producing regions of the world. 
Sustainable development im-plies not consuming more resources today than we can 
replace tomorrow, but sustainable forest man-agement implies more than merely a 
non-declining supply of timber. Forests as a whole provide vital ecosystem 
services, as important atmospheric carbon sinks for example. According to the 
Intergovern-mental Panel on Climate Change, global deforestation is a major 
contributor to global atmospheric car-bon emissionsand greenhouse gases, while 
forest growth is a major factor in removals of carbon dioxide from the 
atmosphere, and thus forest management and forest growth count among the 
largest available offsets of atmospheric carbon emissions (Nabuurs et al., 
2007) conomical industrial timber utilization is a vital element in sustaining 
forests and avoiding large-scale deforestation, not by avoiding timber harvest 
but by making forestry more economical and sustainable.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>&nbsp;Value 
Prior to Pulping (VPP) is a novel biorefining concept for pulp mills that 
includes hydrolysis extraction of hemicellulose wood sugars and acetic acid 
from pulpwood prior to pulping. The concept involves conversion of wood sugars 
via fermentation to fuel ethanol or other chemicals and the use of remaining 
solid wood material in the pulping process. This paper provides an overview of 
the methods and results from analysis of the concept as a hypothetical business

<b>Abstract:
</b>&nbsp;This review on research on life cycle carbon accounting examines the 
complexities in accounting for carbon emissions given the many different ways 
that wood is used. Recent objectives to increase the use of renewable fuels 
have raised policy questions, with respect to the sustainability of managing 
our forests as well as the impacts of how best to use wood from our forests. 
There has been general support for the benefits of sustainably managing forests 
for carbon mitigation as expressed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate 
Change in 2007. However, there are many integrated carbon pools involved, which 
have led to conflicting implications for best practices and policy. In 
particular, sustainable management of forests for products produces 
substantially different impacts than a focus on a single stand or on specific 
carbon pools with each contributing to different policy implications. In this 
article, we review many recent research findings on carbon impacts across all 
stages of processing from cradle-to-grave, based on life cycle accounting, 
which is necessary to understand the carbon interactions across many different 
carbon pools. The focus is on where findings are robust and where uncertainties 
may be large enough to question key assumptions that impact carbon in the 
forest and its many uses. Many opportunities for reducing carbon emissions are 
identified along with unintended consequences of proposed policies.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>&nbsp;In 
this article, we raise three technical concerns about Evans&prime; 1999<i>
Appita Journal</i> &Prime;variance approach&Prime; to estimating microfibril 
angle (MFA). The first concern is associated with the approximation of the 
variance of an X-ray intensity half-profile by a function of the MFA and the 
natural variability of the MFA. The second concern is associated with the 
approximation of the natural variability of the MFA by a function of the MFA. 
The third concern is associated with the fact that the variance approach was 
not designed to handle tilt in the fiber orientation. All three concerns are 
associated with potential biases in MFA estimates. We raise these three 
concerns so that other researchers interested in understanding, implementing, 
or extending the variance approach or in comparing the approach to other 
methods of estimating MFA will be aware of them.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>
&nbsp;For many countries, international trade is a significant factor in 
commercial use of forests. Exports are, in some cases, a significant source of 
value for regional and national economies. Imports may either supplement or be 
a substitute for production from domestic sources. The values and volumes of 
wood product exports and imports are important because of the increasing 
importance of global markets in determining prices in domestic markets, the 
sustainable use of domestic resources, and the profitability of domestic 
industries.<br>

Abstract:</b>&nbsp;As the world emerges from the economic and financial crisis 
of 2008-2009, demand for energy is rising, as well as the costs. Increasing 
fossil fuel costs provide incentive for lower-cost wood-based fuels. In 
addition to these market forces, government policies to promote renewable 
energy continue to promote wood for energy. Sometimes these policies raise 
competition for readily available wood supply. However, in the medium and long 
term, the forests in the UNECE region can support greater harvests to satisfy 
the growing need for paper and wood products, as well as wood energy.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>&nbsp;A statistical analysis was performed that 
identified time trends in the Scheffer Index value for 167 locations in the 
conterminous United States over the period 1969-2008. Year-to-year variation in 
Index values was found to be larger than year-to-year variation in most other 
weather parameters. Despite the substantial yearly variation, regression 
equations, with time (year) as the independent variable could be fit to the 
Scheffer Index data. A linear regression was found to provide appropriate fit 
when square-root transformations of Scheffer Index values were used as the 
dependent variable, and error terms were fitted as being spatially dependent. 
The 167 locations were segregated into ten climate groupings (termed 
&Prime;regions&Prime;) based on annual precipitation and number of Fahrenheit 
Heating Degree Days. In most &Prime;regions&Prime; the calculated time 
coefficient value for the regression equation was positive, indicating a 
40-year trend toward increase in Scheffer Index value. In three of the ten 
&Prime;regions&Prime;, the time trend was moreover found to be statistically 
significant. All three of these &Prime;regions&amp;Prime were moist, with 
annual precipitation exceeding 20 inches (&asymp; 510 mm). The region with the 
most compelling increase in Index value was the moist region with in excess of 
7000 Heating Degree Days. This region encompassed northern New England, the 
northern portion of the Great Lakes region, the Upper Mississippi valley, 
northern Minnesota, and the eastern part of North Dakota.<br>

<b>Abstract:
</b>&nbsp;Global trends in pulp, paper, and paperboard have deeply affected 
U.S. pulpwood markets since the late 1990s. Global trends included a shift of 
growth in paper and paperboard production from North America to Europe and Asia 
over the past decade. This trend was associated with generally slower growth in 
U.S. industrial production and displacement of growth in print media 
advertising expenditures by electronic media. Wood pulp consumption in the 
United States was also offset by increased paper recycling since the late 
1980s. The net impact of these trends was a contraction of growth in U.S. 
pulpwood demand and generally declining real prices for pulpwood since the late 
1990s. The current status and trends of the U.S. pulpwood market contrast 
sharply to decades prior to the 1990s, when growth in U.S. pulpwood demand was 
more robust. Future growth in U.S. pulpwood demand is likely to be relatively 
subdued for the near term. Total pulpwood demand for wood pulp, wood panel 
products, and export has potential to increase in the U.S. South but only 
gradually in the decades ahead, while likely to remain flat or declining in 
other U.S. regions. Biofuels and bioenergy represent emerging demands for wood 
biomass, and potential future demands for pulpwood, but sustained higher oil 
prices or further technical advances plus new capital investments will be 
needed before biofuels create strong competing demands for pulpwood. Pulpwood 
still has much higher value-added potential in production of wood pulp than in 
production of biofuels such as cellulosic ethanol. In the near future, 
consumption of pulpwood in the emerging cellulosic biofuel industry is likely 
to remain a small fraction of total U.S. pulpwood supply and demand, although 
long-range future wood use for biofuel could be potentially quite large, 
depending on future oil prices and technological developments. The current 
depressed status of the U.S. pulpwood market presents a near-term policy 
challenge in forest management, whether to provide incentives to sustain or 
expand pulpwood supply in current times of lean demand growth when there may be 
much larger foreseeable needs, but only in the long run.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>&nbsp;For the forestry and 
logging, wood products, paper products, and wood furniture industries, in 2002, 
of a total $72.5 billion (2005$) in wages, profits and taxes, 80% went to 
wages, 18% to profits and 2% to taxes; 43% was provided by paper products 
industries, 35% by wood products industries, 17% by wood furniture industries 
and 5% by forestry and logging. Revenues to landowners from stumpage sales in 
1997 were $22 billion (2005$) of which 5% went to National Forests, 6% went to 
other public lands, 33% went to industry land owners, and 56% went to other 
private landowners. Since 1997 much of the industry forest land has been sold 
to Timber Management Organizations and Real Estate Investment Trusts, so the 
share of stumpage revenues going to industry land owners has probably declined. 
Of 18 million acres of forest land on Indian reservations in the U.S., 5.7 
million acres are commercial timberland. In 2001 these lands provided $95 
million of revenue (2005$) mostly from industrial timber harvest or 0.4% of the 
U.S. total 1997 stumpage revenue of $22 billion (2005$). The Northwest region 
accounted for over 70 percent of the timber volume and more than 85 percent of 
revenue, followed by the Lake States at 13.5 percent of the timber volume and 
over 7 percent of revenue. No trend information is available on revenues to 
various groups.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>&nbsp;Quantities of paper 
and wood recovered for recycling in the United States were estimated for 1994, 
based on production and end-use data. The estimates included quantities 
recovered for recycling into new paper and paperboard products, exports of 
recov-ered paper, and quantities of paper and wood materials recovered and 
recycled into other products, including cellulose insulation, molded pulp 
products, fiberboard products, wooden pallets, animal bedding, mulch, 
particleboard, hardboard, reclaimed lumber, flooring, roof systems, siding, 
plastic lumber, and other composite products. Additional quantities of paper 
and wood that could be recovered annually were also estimated for 1993, based 
on maximum potential recovery from municipal solid waste, new construction and 
demolition debris, and primary timber processing. Current and potential 
recovery estimates indicate that wood and wood fiber recycling technology could 
exploit a large resource base if efficient technology is developed to fully 
utilize this resource.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>&nbsp;This 
paper describes an approach to modeling U.S. forest sector market and trade 
impacts of expansion in domestic wood energy consumption under hypothetical 
future U.S. wood biomass energy policy scenarios. The U.S. Forest Products 
Module (USFPM) was created to enhance the modeling of the U.S. forest sector 
within the Global Forest Products Model (GFPM), providing a more detailed 
representation of U.S. regional timber supply and wood residue markets. 
Scenarios were analyzed with USFPM/GFPM ranging from a baseline 48% increase to 
a 173% increase in annual U.S. consumption of wood for energy from 2006 to 
2030, while consumption of fuelwood in other countries was assumed to increase 
by around 65% in aggregate. Results indicate that expansion in wood energy 
consumption across the range of scenarios may have little impact on U.S. forest 
sector markets because most of the expansion can be supplied by logging 
residues that are presently not being utilized and also mill residues that will 
increase in supply with projected expansion in wood product output in the 
decades ahead. However, analysis also suggests that forest sector markets could 
be disrupted by expansion in wood energy if much higher levels of wood energy 
consumption occur, or if projected recovery in housing demand and wood product 
output does not occur, or if more restrictive constraints or higher costs are 
imposed on wood residue utilization.<br>

Abstract:</b>&nbsp;The lack of data about employment in a number of categories 
indicates that we do not have full understanding of employment associated with 
forestry. But for some categories, employment has been declining - especially 
for wood furniture manufacturing, and to a lesser degree for the pulp and paper 
industries. This is due in part to lower competitiveness with respect to 
production and import of products from other countries. There has been a 
decline in jobs in the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, but jobs 
in state forestry agencies are steady to increasing. Increasing participation 
in forest-based recreation suggests increases in forest-based recreation jobs. 
It would appear that in the recent past there has been a shift in the types of 
jobs that forests support.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>&nbsp;Average annual incomes for forest 
management and protection includes salaries for full-time permanent employees 
of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, which have increased 
from a median of $41,300 in 1992 to $48,200 in 2000, to $50,500 in 2006 (all in 
2005$). Salary of full-time permanent employees in state forestry agencies in 
1998, for entry level foresters, ranged from $48,000 for the Pacific Coast, 
$39,000 in the North, $35,000 for the Rocky Mountains, and $28,000 for the 
South (all in 2005$). Trends in wages for the pulp and paper industry have been 
increasing at the same pace as wages for all manufacturing while the trend in 
wages for solidwood industries has not kept pace. Injury rates in forest 
products industries have been declining at the same pace as for all 
manufacturing. Businesses in the nontimber forest products (NTFP) industry are 
generally small, exceptions exist, but most employ less than 10 people. Many 
workers receive fewer benefits or lower wages, or experience worse working 
conditions than they would in the formal economy. Injury rates for the 
non-timber forest products sectors have not been assessed. Gathering products 
in the forest can be dangerous, and there are reports in the media of people 
becoming lost or injured every year. In the 2006 average income for a person 
employed in the forest recreation and tourism private sector is estimated to be 
$23,517, approximately 9% less than the average American.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>&nbsp;At times in history, 
there have been concerns that demand for wood (timber) would be greater than 
the ability to supply it, but that concern has recently dissipated. The wood 
supply and demand situation has changed because of market transitions, economic 
downturns, and continued forest growth. This article provides a concise 
overview of this change as it relates to the United States, looking at 
nationwide trends in the pulp and paper sector and the solid wood and composite 
wood product sectors (lumber and wood panels) and also nationwide trends in 
timber growth, timber removals, and real prices for timber.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>
&nbsp;This indicator shows the trend in recovering wood and paper for reuse in 
products in the United States. This reuse can hold down the need to harvest 
wood to meet U.S. consumption needs. The paper recycling rate (utilization rate 
in producing new paper) increased from 22% to 38% between 1970 and 1996, but 
then stabilized at 37% to 38% between 1996 and 2006. This rate has been stable 
despite continuing increase in the recovery rate of paper in the 1990s though 
2006 to 51% because increases in recovery after the mid 1990s have been 
exported. The effects of increasing recovery after the mid 1990s were felt 
primarily in offsetting harvest in other countries and not in the United 
States. The estimated recovered wood utilization rate is highly uncertain, but 
is estimated to have increased from an insignificant amount in 1990 to 10% in 
2006. The recovered wood utilization rate for wood pallets alone has increased 
from 2% in 1993 to 34% in 2000 and 38% in 2006. A rough estimate of the 
recycling rate (utilization rate) of post-consumer wood and paper into burning 
with energy generation is 15% to 20% for the period 1990 to 2006.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>&nbsp;This article 
documents cradle-to-gate life-cycle inventories for softwood lumber, hardwood 
lumber, and solid-strip hardwood flooring manufacturing from the Inland 
Northwest and the Northeast - North Central regions of the US. Environmental 
impacts were measured based on emissions to air and water, solid waste, energy 
consumption, and resource use. The manufacturing stage consumed the greatest 
amount of energy representing 90 - 92% of the total. Total energy consumption 
for softwood lumber manufacturing was about one-half of that required for 
hardwood lumber and hardwood flooring. The use of wood biomass as the primary 
energy source for manufacturing greatly reduced the environmental burdens by 
offsetting the demand for fossil fuels. Transportation impacts contributed 
approximately 3%, and forestry and harvesting operations accounted for 3 - 7%. 
Management and harvesting of softwoods in the Northeast-North Central regions 
required a greater amount of energy attributable to higherintensity management 
scenarios.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>
&nbsp;Finding the environmental impact of building materials is becoming 
increasingly more important because of public environmental awareness. Accurate 
and precise life-cycle inventory data on wood products are needed to meet this 
demand. This study examined softwood lumber manufacturing in the northeastern 
and north central US using life-cycle inventory methods. Material flow, energy 
type, and energy use were identified for these sawmills. A softwood log mass 
conversion of 42.1% to planed dry lumber was found. Values of 355 MJ of 
electricity and 2730 MJ of processed energy per cubic meter were determined for 
manufacturing planed dry softwood lumber burning mostly green wood residues 
onsite for energy. Biomass and fossil carbon dioxide production of 187 and 65.1 
kg/m3, respectively, were estimated. Lowering energy consumption would be of 
great benefit to the mills, and thus society, in reducing the environmental 
burden, especially in sawing and drying.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>&nbsp;This study explains and determines 
fuelwood consumption at the county level based on county economic and 
demographic conditions, and identifies U.S. counties where potential fuelwood 
use problems and benefits are greatest. The percentage of wood-burning 
households in a county is estimated and multiplied by estimated average wood 
consumed per wood-burning household in that county to produce an estimate of 
total county fuelwood use. Use estimates are then compared to forest inventory 
data to identify potential problem/benefit areas. Parameters in estimating 
equations are determined from fuelwood use data for individual households from 
a 1980-81 nationwide survey of 5,506 households.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>&nbsp;With green building 
concepts becoming widespread in the construction field, building practices and 
materials are being examined for their environmental impact. Reusing building 
materials has a distinct advantage over using newly manufactured materials 
because these reclaimed materials avoid greenhouse gas emissions associated 
with new (virgin) material manufacturing. In a wood-framed building, building 
materials reclaimed during deconstructing (dismantling) may include framing 
lumber and wood flooring. This study quantified the energy impact of reusing 
these two wood materials in new construction or remodeling. This paper presents 
results of a deconstruction industry survey following Consortium for Research 
on Renewable Industrial Materials Research Guidelines. A life-cycle inventory 
approach was applied to track the energy consumption and emissions associated 
with reclaiming materials. This study showed how the material flowed through 
the various unit processes beginning at the deconstruction site and ending at a 
storage facility. We used weight-averaged material and energy production data 
to estimate the environmental impact of the two reclaimed materials. Results 
from this life-cycle inventory showed that cumulative energy consumed in 
producing virgin compared to reclaimed framing lumber and wood flooring was 
about 11 and 13 times greater, respectively. Global Warming Potential was about 
3 and 5 times greater, respectively. These results indicate that reclaimed 
framing lumber and wood flooring have a significantly lower environmental 
impact than their two virgin alternatives.<br>

<b>Abstract:
</b>&nbsp;In this paper we raise three technical concerns about Evans's 1999 <i>
Appita Journal</i> 'variance approach' to estimating microfibril angle. The 
first concern is associated with the approximation of the variance of an X-ray 
intensity halfprofile by a function of the microfibril angle and the natural 
variability of the microfibril angle. The second concern is associated with the 
approximation of the natural variability of the microfibril angle by a function 
of the icrofibril angle. The third concern is associated with the fact that the 
variance approach was not designed to handle tilt in the fiber orientation. All 
three concerns are associated with potential biases in microfibril angle 
estimates. We raise these three concerns so that other researchers interested 
in understanding, implementing, or extending the variance approach or in 
comparing the approach to other methods of estimating MFA will be aware of them.

<b>Abstract:</b>&nbsp;Detailed structural studies on the plant cell 
wall have traditionally been difficult. NMR is one of the preeminent structural 
tools, but obtaining high-resolution solution-state spectra has typically 
required fractionation and isolation of components of interest. With recent 
methods for dissolution of, admittedly, finely divided plant cell wall 
material, the wall can now be studied by solution-state NMR. Exploiting the 
dispersion of 2D (and even 3D) NMR allows strikingly detailed structural 
analysis of the wall components without the need for isolation and 
fractionation. The initial method utilized acetylation of the wall to prepare 
optimal samples for NMR, but more recently we avoid the acetylation step; 
spectra from unacetylated walls have improved resolution of some components and 
allow natural acetylation (of polysaccharides and lignins) to be readily 
identified. The structural 'fingerprint' of the cell wall produced by 2D13C-1H 
correlative NMR experiments is potentially unmatched by any other spectroscopy. 
Dissolution/NMR methods therefore potentially lend themselves well to 
chemometrics methods once the issues of dealing with multivariate analyses on 
2D NMR data have been addressed. Improved throughput (in principle, toward 50 
samples per day) seems possible.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>&nbsp;Forestry 
operations require ever more use of expensive capital equipment. Mechanization 
is frequently necessary to perform cost-effective and safe operations. 
Increased capital should mean more sophisticated capital costing methodologies. 
However the machine rate method, which is the costing methodology most 
frequently used, dates back to 1942. CHARGEOUT!, a recently introduced 
discounted cash flow methodology is compared with seven machine rate methods 
using data representing a skidder. I found that use of machine rate methods can 
lead to either over or under-estimates of machine owning and operating costs, 
depending on the machine rate model used. CHARGEOUT!'s calculated rate will 
provide a user-specified rate of return. The differences between the results 
calculated by the machine rate methods occur because of different implicit 
assumptions used within the models' formulas. The differences between 
CHARGEOUT! and the machine rate models occur largely because of the inability 
of the machine rate models to properly incorporate the time value of money. 
Whereas CHARGEOUT! can be sufficiently constrained so as to more-or-less 
replicate a machine rate calculation, doing so sacrifices much of CHARGEOUT!'s 
power and flexibility. Machine rate models cannot be configured to replicate 
CHARGEOUT!'s calculations. Machine rate models cannot be configured to 
calculate cash flows, allow for uneven costs or machine hours, incorporate 
loans that have a different life than the expected machine life, incorporate 
financing, or perform an after tax analysis. Machine rate models cannot 
calculate a costing rate that will provide a specified rate of return. 
CHARGEOUT! is a capital costing model that overcomes these limitations.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>&nbsp;It has been argued that repetitive member allowable 
property adjustments should be larger for high-variability materials than for 
low-variability materials.We report analytic calculations and simulations that 
suggest that the order of such adjustments should be reversed, that is, given 
the manner in which allowable properties are currently calculated, as the 
coefficient of variation of the strength distribution of individual elements 
increases, the upward repetitive member adjustments (if any) of assemblies 
constructed from these elements should decrease.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>&nbsp;Total consumption of wood and paper 
products and fuelwood in roundwood equivalents, increased between 1965 and 1988 
from 13.2 to 18.9 billion cubic feet. Since 1988, it has been about 20 billion 
cubic feet per year. Total per capita consumption increased between 1965 and 
1987, from 68 to 83 ft3 per year. Since 1987 through 2006, per capita 
consumption has declined to 68 ft3 per year. Consumption excluding fuelwood 
increased steadily between 1965 and 2006, from 12.3 to 18.8 billion cubic feet. 
Most of the increase occurred between 1965 and 1988. Per capita consumption 
excluding fuelwood, has been relatively stable, averaging 63 ft 3 per year. So, 
in roundwood equivalents, wood and paper products consumption has been 
increasing at roughly the pace of population. Total consumption has been 
increasing faster than domestic harvest as net imports of wood and paper 
products have increased. If consumption continues to increase faster than 
domestic harvest, then an increasing proportion of the environmental and 
economic effects of our consumption will be felt in forests in other countries 
that export products to the U.S.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>&nbsp;Trend data through 
2006 are provided on the value and volume of wood and wood products production 
for the United States to aid in assessing sustainability of socioeconomic 
benefits of forests. The volume of roundwood used to make products, the weight 
produced, and the value of U.S. shipments have been stable to declining in 
recent years. But there have been increases in the weight of oriented 
strandboard production and the value of furniture production. U.S. demand for 
products is likely to continue to increase with increasing population and Gross 
Domestic Product (GDP). If the cost of providing wood products from the United 
States is high relative to other countries or alternative materials, this would 
limit increase in the level of U.S. harvest and the value that contributes to 
forest management, employment, and wages. Volume of roundwood harvest has 
increased in the South but declined in other regions although value of 
shipments for wood and paper products (excluding furniture) has declined in all 
regions. If value of shipments continues to decline, this would decrease 
revenues to forest landowners and employees. Maintaining revenues from forests 
would require increased revenues from other sources including recreation, 
environmental services, or new products such as biomass for energy.<br>

Abstract:</b>&nbsp;The United States has become progressively more reliant on 
imports to meet consumption needs. In roundwood equivalents, imports of wood 
and paper products as a share of consumption increased from 13% to 30% between 
1965 and 2005. This increase is due largely to increased softwood lumber import 
share, which increased from 15% in 1965 to 38% in 2006. The import share for 
other products was stable from 1965 to 1990, but has since increased. Export 
share of production, over this same period, initially increased from 5% in 1965 
to 16% in 1991 then decreased to 10% in 2006. This pattern is due to initial 
increases and subsequent declines in export share for softwood lumber, softwood 
plywood, and paper and paperboard. For hardwood lumber, the export share has 
continued to increase, and for pulp the share increased then levelled off after 
the mid 1990s. If these trends continue, we will become increasingly dependent 
on forests outside the United States-making us less self-sufficient-in 
providing benefits from use of wood and paper. The effects of forest 
management, harvesting, and processing wood in the United States would be 
shifted to forests and industries in other countries.<br>

<b>Abstract:
</b>&nbsp;In recent years, we have received hundreds of requests for small 
scale lumber dry kiln plans from woodworking hobbyists. People were looking for 
an inexpensive and simple kiln design that could cost effectively dry as little 
as a few hundred board feet of lumber or as much as several thousand board feet 
of lumber each year. There are many different kiln designs including solar, 
dehumidification, direct or indirect fired, and vacuum kilns. For small 
operations, there is a large amount of information available on solar kiln 
design and operation. However, solar lumber kilns are not effective for large 
portions of the calendar year in northern climates (due to cold winter 
temperatures).<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>&nbsp;Small, 
rural forested communities have the economic need to develop a wood products 
industry to replace the loss of large sawmills and maintain forest health. The 
main objective of this study was to explore the potential of using producer 
(wood) gas to fire a hot water boiler for a small dry kiln capable of drying 
both softwood and hardwood lumber. A BioMax wood gasifier, a hot water boiler, 
and dry kiln were integrated as parts of a whole lumber drying system for a 
field test in southwestern United States. Results so far found the amount of 
gas heat produced from the wood chip-fed BioMax 15 and 50 is 250,000 and 
1,000,000 Btus per hour respectively, while the hot water boiler provides 
109,000 Btus per hour for a 3,500 board foot dry kiln.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>&nbsp;Forests play an 
important role in the U.S. and global carbon cycle, and carbon sequestered by 
U.S. forest growth and harvested wood products currently offsets 12-19% of U.S. 
fossil fuel emissions. The cycle of forest growth, death, and regeneration and 
the use of wood removed from the forest complicate efforts to understand and 
measure forest carbon pools and flows. Our report explains these processes and 
examines the science behind mechanisms proposed for increasing the amount of 
carbon stored in forests and using wood to offset fossil fuel use. We also 
examine the tradeoffs, costs, and benefits associated with each mechanism and 
explain how forest carbon is measured.<br>

Abstract:</b>&nbsp;Overstocked small-diameter softwood timber in western US 
forests has created a serious forest health and fire hazard, and the costs of 
removing this material are high. One way to lower costs is to reduce loss 
because of warp on lumber sawn from these small logs. Using a green-gluing 
process, standard 38 by 89-mm (nominal 2 by 4-in.) pieces (2 by 4s) ripped from 
pressed panels of edge-glued (edge-glued-and-rip [EGAR]) boards sawn from small 
ponderosa pine (<i>Pinus ponderosa</i>) logs were evaluated for warp reduction. 
Material was bonded at high moisture content (MC) to simulate lumber freshly 
sawn from water-saturated logs and examine potentia1 MC effects on 
wood-woodbonding.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>
&nbsp;A greenhouse gas and carbon accounting profile was developed for the U.S. 
forest products industry value chain for 1990 and 2004-2005 by examining net 
atmospheric fluxes of CO2and other green housegases (GHGs)using a variety of 
methods and data sources. Major GHG emission sources include direct and 
indirect (from purchased electricity generation) emissions from manufacturing 
and methane emissions from landfilled products. Forest carbon stocks in forests 
supplying wood to the industry were found to be stable or increasing. Increases 
in the annual amounts of carbon removed from the atmosphere and stored in 
forest products offset about half of the total value chain emissions. Overall 
net transfers to the atmosphere totaled 91.8 and 103.5 TgCO2-eq. in 1990 and 
2005, respectively, although the difference between these net transfers may not 
be statistically significant. Net transfers were higher in 2005 primarily 
because additions to carbon stored in forest products were less in 2005. Over 
this same period, energy-related manufacturing emissions decreased by almost 9% 
even though forest products output increased by approximately 15%. Several 
types of avoided emissions were considered separately and were collectively 
found to be notable relative to net emissions.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>&nbsp;Global pulp, paper and 
board markets experienced an abrupt transition over the past year. A year ago 
(mid-year 2008) economic conditions indicated markets and prices were peaking 
amid a slowing economy, rising input costs, and erosion of profits. That was on 
the heels of a global energy crisis but just before full onset of the global 
financial crisis later in the year. In the second half of 2008 and continuing 
into the first half of 2009, global paper and paperboard demand deteriorated 
rapidly as the financial crisis abruptly reduced consumer spending, 
international trade flows and industrial production. The downturn was most 
severe for graphic papers and significant also for packaging paper and board, 
while tissue and sanitary paper markets were only modestly affected.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>&nbsp;The use of wood for energy -- 
including the burning of solid wood and black liquor from pulping -- has been 
growing at a rate significantly greater than that for all other uses such as 
lumber, pulp, or particleboard. In the United States, the end of most wood is 
not lumber or pulp and paper but feed for energy. In 1983, 155*5 M Mg of wood 
were used for energy. This could threaten to increase the price of wood for 
those other uses', or it can stimulate us to seek more creative ways of using 
untapped wood resources for fuel. On the basis of estimates of heavy wood 
energy use relative to other uses for wood, and estimates of continuing high 
costs for fossil fuels, we suggest here the feasibility of meeting the demand 
for fuelwood through small-scale cooperatives. Such an approach can improve 
forestry practices and can avoid unduly increasing the cost of wood for other 
end uses.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>
&nbsp;The Western Governors' Association assessment of biofuels potential in 
western states estimated the location and capacity of biofuels plants that 
could potentially be built for selected gasoline prices in 2015 using a mixed 
integer programming model. The model included information on forest biomass 
supply curves by county (developed using Forest Service FIA data), agricultural 
biomass supply curves, transportation networks, and capital and operating costs 
of selected conversion technologies. Results indicate biofuels could 
potentially provide between 5 and 10 percent of projected transportation fuel 
demand in the region with fuel price between $2.40 and $3.00 per gasoline 
gallon equivalence (gge) excluding local distribution costs and taxes. At a 
target price of $2.40/gge, forest biomass could supply an estimated 11 million 
oven dry tons per year, or about 9 percent of total feedstock supplied.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>&nbsp;The 
Lake States region of Minnesota, Wisconsin and Michigan offers significant 
potential for bioenergy production. We examine the sustainability of regional 
forest biomass use in the context of existing thermal heating, electricity,and 
biofuels production,projected resource needs over the next decade including 
existing forest product market demand, and impacts on price and feasibility. 
Assuming $36 per dry tonne at roadside, 4.1 million dry tonnes of forest 
biomass could be available region-wide. However,less is likely available due to 
localized environmental and forest cover type constraints, and land owner 
willingness to harvest timber. Total projected demand of 5.7 million dry 
tonnes, based on current and announced industry capacity, exceeds estimates of 
biomass availability, which suggests that anticipated growth in the 
forest-based bio economy may be constrained. Attaining projected demand will 
likely require a combination of higher cost feed stocks,integration of energy 
and non-energy uses, and careful managementto meet environmental constraints. 
Stated istinctions in biomass harvest guidelines and the propensity for 
third-party forest certification will be critical in providing environmental 
safeguards.The cumulative effect of policy initiatives on biomass competition 
are discussed in the context of an emerging Lake States bioeconomy.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>&nbsp;The cellulosic feedstocks (see chapter 2) needed to 
produce 20 billion gallons per year (BGY) of second-generation and other 
renewable fuels can come from a wide variety of cropland and forestland 
sources, including imports. The impact of producing these biofuels on U.S. 
agriculture and forestry will very much depend on the relative proportions of 
cropland- and forestland-derived feedstocks and the extent to which imports are 
used to meet the mandate. To meet the 2022 target, upwards of 240 million dry 
tons of feedstock would be needed from U.S. croplands if no forest-sourced 
biomass or imported biofuels are used. Much less cropland-derived feedstock 
would be needed if forest biomass and imports are used.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>
&nbsp;While the economic crisis in late 2008 and early 2009 reduced the demand 
for energy, as evidenced by a steep decline in the price of oil, government 
policies to promote renewable energy sources have kept the wood energy market 
strong. With oil prices rising in mid-2009, market demand for alternative 
fuels, including wood, is growing. Government policy measures enacted to 
counter economic recessions often include funding to improve energy 
independence from fossil fuels. Subsidies aimed at improving the environment 
are part of what is termed the green new deal. This includes, for example, 
building infrastructure to produce and use carbon-neutral woodbased fuels. 
During its session scheduled for 12-16 October 2009, the UNECE Timber Committee 
will hold a policy forum entitled 'The forest sector in the green economy'. 
Wood energy will be an important topic during the forum.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>&nbsp;Because of the large percentage of 
juvenile wood in small-diameter southern pine, this material has lower strength 
properties compared with the historic published values in the ASTM Standard 
D2555. Finding new, simple, and inexpensive ways of increasing these strength 
properties would increase the use of this material for residential 
construction. For this study, we chose in situ polymerization using the monomer 
1,6-hexanediol dimethacrylate to enhance bending strength and stiffness. After 
determining the lower range of density, modulus of rupture (MOR), and modulus 
of elasticity (MOE) of juvenile wood from small southern pine logs, southern 
pine specimens were polymerized using both a vacuum-impregnation and a 
surface-application approach. The results showed some significant physical 
property increases for the fully impregnated material that used a large amount 
of monomer. Although the surface-application approach used less monomer, the 
physical properties of the juvenile wood did not increase as expected. Only the 
1-minute dip treatment showed a significant increase in both bending stiffness 
and strength, with a weight gain of 11.9 percent. For the surface-application 
approach, monomer moving to the wood surface during polymerization reduced 
their effectiveness in increasing MOR and MOE to the expected levels. 
Therefore, the challenge is finding a method that maintains polymer loading 
inside the wood structure during the curing process.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>&nbsp;The construction of new single family, 
multifamily, and manufactured housing is an important market for wood products 
in both the United States and Canada. Annual wood products consumption is 
dependent on many factors, including the number of new units started, the size 
of units started, architectural characteristics, and consumer preferences. In 
2006, about 39 percent of all solid wood products consumed in the United States 
and 28 percent of all solid wood products consumed in Canada were used for new 
residential construction (Adair 2008, FAO 2008, McKeever 2009). New residential 
construction continues to be the leading market for solid softwood products in 
the United States and second only to residential repair and remodeling in 
Canada.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>&nbsp;The repair and 
remodeling of residential units in both the United States and Canada is an 
important market for wood products. Many and varied repair and remodeling 
activities and projects are undertaken annually. Some require substantial 
amounts of wood products, some none at all. In 2006, about 28 percent of all 
solid wood products consumed in the United States and 31 percent of all solid 
wood products consumed in Canada are used for residential repair and remodeling 
(Adair 2008, FAO 2008, McKeever 2009). This market has become much more 
important in recent years as housing stocks have grown larger and older, and as 
homeowner incomes have risen.<br>

Abstract:</b>&nbsp;Wheat straw is renewable, widely distributed, available 
locally, moldable, anisotropic, hydroscopic, recyclable, versatile, 
non-abrasive, porous, viscoelastic, easily available in many forms, 
biodegradable, combustible, compostible, and reactive. It also has a high 
aspect ratio, high strength-to-weight ratio, and has good insulation properties 
(sound, electrical, and thermal). The fiber structure is hollow and laminated, 
with molecular layers and an integrated matrix. Some might consider part of 
these properties as problems, such as biodegradable and combustible. but these 
features provide a means of predictable and programmable disposal not easily 
achieved with other resources. Many possible composite products can be made 
using wheat fibers including structural (using thermosetting resins) and 
nonstructural (using either a thermosetting or thermoplastic resin) materials, 
geotextiles and molded products (using fiber mats prepared by physical 
entanglement, nonwoven needling, or thermoplastic fiber-melt matrix 
technologies), sorbents and filters (for removing pollutants from contaminated 
air, water, and/or soil), packaging, and in products in combination of other 
resources. Success or failure in producing these products depends on many 
factors including codes and standards, economies of scale, availability of 
resources, energy and labor costs, resource handing, collecting and shipping, 
and overcoming historical biases. Wheat fibers can be combined with other 
resources such as plastics, glass, metals, and synthetics. The objective is to 
combine two or more materials in such a way that a synergism between the 
components results in a new material that is much better than the individual 
components. The properties of wheat fibers can also be modified through 
physical and chemical technologies to improve performance of the final 
composite.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>
&nbsp;The hardwood chip market is an important element ofwood fiber raw 
material supply for the pulp and paper industry and other pulp-based products 
such as fiberboard. Hardwood chips enter the chip market from two principal 
sources: (1) chips produced from wood residue byproducts at sawmills and (2) 
chips produced from pulpwood roundwood, primarily from chip mills and to a 
small extent from in-woods chipping operations. Chip mills are stand-alone 
facilities that convert pulpwood roundwood into chips for shipment to pulp 
mills; they are usually located remote from pulp mills. Large volumes of chips 
are also produced and utilized on site at pulp mills but do not enter into the 
chip market.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>&nbsp;The 
North American Pulp and Paper Industry has experienced challenges and changes 
much like other business sectors, which have a direct bearing on its marketing 
policies and the raw material supply chain of pulpwood and chips. The issues 
surrounding raw materials for this industry play an important role in affecting 
timber and log purchases, logging contractors and sawmill operations throughout 
the hardwood industry, particularly in the Southern region. Availability and 
pricing of timber and logs can be impacted by the positive or negative factors 
affecting the pulpwood and chip supply chain.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>&nbsp;In 2002, the USDA Forest Service 
completed the fifth nationwide assessment of timber resource demand and supply, 
as mandated periodically by the Resources Planning Act (RPA) (2). The 
assessment included long-range projections of pulp, paper, and paperboard 
production, consumption, and trade, with regional analysis of wood-fiber use, 
paper recovery for recycling, and projections of pulpwood demand and supply. 
The analysis also considered projected growth and expansion of forest 
plantations, such as pine plantations in the South, the market potential for 
agricultural fiber crops, and projected pulpwood demand for wood panel products 
such as oriented strandboard. This paper highlights assumptions and key 
findings related to the wood-fiber demand and supply outlook. A primary 
conclusion is that projected growth in U.S. wood-fiber demand appears at 
present to be economically sustainable for decades to come, taking into account 
ongoing shifts in product markets, international trade, and production 
technology, along with improvements in forest productivity. The analysis points 
to a future of adequacy in domestic wood-fiber resources, not impending 
scarcity. This conclusion, however, should be viewed as a working hypothesis 
that must continue to be examined and tested periodically in the future as new 
data, new insights, and new market trends emerge.<br>

<b>Abstract:
</b>&nbsp;The main factor influencing demand for panels in North America has 
been the slowdown in economic growth owing to interest rate increases in the 
United States in 2000. Overall economic growth has slowed, but sectors differ: 
housing and related manufacturing sectors have held up relatively well while 
general manufacturing has fallen into a recession. On the supply side, major 
capacity additions to OSB weighed on markets for structural panel while 
increases in particle board capacities caused an oversupply in non-structural 
panels. This combination of events upset the existing balance of market forces 
as supply increased faster than demand.<br>

<b>Abstract:
</b>&nbsp;Prompted by continuing concern that timber-based commodities are 
becoming increasingly scarce, this paper presents information on changes in 
real prices (prices deflated by the general producer price index) of timber 
commodities as potential indicators of economic scarcity. Data updating 
previous studies are shown for sawlog stumpage, delivered sawlogs, and lumber; 
pulpwood stumpage, delivered pulpwood, and woodpulp; and delivered veneer logs 
and plywood. Most real prices were constant or increased somewhat during the 
two decades after World War Il. Prices have increased more rapidly since the 
economic recession ending in 1961. Declining housing demand caused a decrease 
in real prices for lumber and plywood be tween 1979 and 1980.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>&nbsp;In 
2008, the countries of the UNECE region accounted for about 55% of the world's 
production and consumption of paper and paperboard, and they produce nearly 
three fourths of the world's woodpulp, used to make paper and paperboard. 
Europe produces slightly more paper and paperboard than North America but less 
woodpulp, with European producers relying more on recycled fibre than producers 
in North America. The United States remains the world's largest producer and 
consumer of pulp, paper and paperboard. Outside the UNECE region, China is 
rapidly gaining ground as the second largest producer and consumer of paper and 
paperboard worldwide. Much of China's rapid growth is based on recycled fibre 
and imported pulp. Rapid expansion of Chinese pulp and paper production 
capacity is having a huge impact on paper and paperboard markets, and on global 
competition for wood, recovered paper, and pulp.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>&nbsp;Using 
sustainable building materials is gaining a significant presence in the United 
States therefore proving sustainability claims are becoming increasingly more 
important. Certifying wood products as green building materials is vital for 
the long-term productivity of the wood building industry and for forest 
management. This study examined hardwood lumber manufacturing using Life-Cycle 
Inventory methodology. Material flow and energy type and use were identified 
for hardwood sawmills in the northeastern United States. Energy consumption of 
608 MJ of electricity and 5,800 MJ of thermal energy per m3 were determined for 
the manufacturing of planed dry hardwood lumber from incoming logs. Burning 
green wood residues on-site generate the most energy. Hardwood log volume 
conversion to planed dry lumber of 43.7% was estimated. Modeling data estimated 
biomass and fossil carbon dioxide production of 428 kg per m3 and 139 kg per m3
, respectively. Increasing wood fuel use, a carbon-neutral process, would 
decrease the environmental impact of hardwood lumber manufacturing and increase 
its value as a green building material.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>&nbsp;This report presents annual data but 
is published every 2 years. The data present current and historical information 
on the production, trade, consumption, and prices of timber products in the 
United States. The report focuses on national statistics but includes some data 
for individual States and regions and for Canada. The data were collected from 
industry trade associations and government agencies. They are intended for use 
by forest land managers, forest industries, trade associations, forestry 
schools, renewable resource organizations, individuals in the major timber 
producing and consuming countries of the world, and the general public. A major 
use of the data is tracking industry production and consumption trends with 
time. One of the major shifts occurring recently in the wood using industry is 
that both production and consumption of roundwood per capita have declined even 
though consumption of products per capita is increasing - due to increased 
paper recycling, increased imports, and increased processing efficiency. 
Consumption per capita in roundwood equivalent has decreased during the past 15 
years from 80 ft3 per capita to 67 ft3 per capita in 2002. In the 1960s and 
1970s, consumption averaged about 70 ft3 per capita.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>&nbsp;Between 2006 and the end of 2009, 
the production capacity of the softwood lumber sector covered by this report in 
the United States and Canada has shrunk from 190.8 million m3 (nominal) to 
166.4 million m3. The corresponding number of mills slumped from 1,025 to 875 
over the same time and from 1,322 recorded in 1995. The Canadian capacity went 
from 88.2 million m3 to 71.6 million m3, a loss of 19%, while the U.S. capacity 
dropped from 102.6 million m3 to 94.8 million m3, a loss of 8%. These losses 
are attributable to three unprofitable years of sawmilling caused by the 
contraction in construction. Construction and repair and remodeling of homes 
each accounted for about 35% of total lumber consumption in 2006. Their 
downturn has caused demand to lag substantially behind the capacity that was 
built up to supply the prior boom. The greater drop in Canadian capacity can be 
deduced from a number of factors including the imposition of tariffs of up to 
15% on exports to the U.S. and the strengthening of the Canadian dollar. Based 
on underlying population growth, the demand for home building is expected to 
rebound but somewhat slowly until the overhang of unoccupied homes built in the 
former building surge is absorbed. Further attrition of capacity is likely, as 
profitability is unlikely to return until a combination of recovering demand 
and contracting supply due to further capacity attrition equalize in the market.

<b>Abstract:</b>&nbsp;A 
vintage year for sawmilling 2008 was not. In an industry strongly driven to 
produce, we were apprehensive that firms would be more shy than usual about 
divulging their 2008 activities. So this year we cast a wider net but, in the 
end, 149 out of the 200 mills appearing on the Top 200 list, and 48 out of the 
top 50, volunteered their numbers. For the remainder, capacities usually serve 
as a good proxy because most mills strive to operate near their limits in good 
years. This year, however, that approach was unreliable because operating rates 
varied widely. Among our respondents they ranged from 17 to 107% with an 
average of 72% (Figure 1). By contrast, 2008 data from the Western Wood 
Products Assn. (WWPA) implied a 68% U.S. utilization rate. Therefore, to more 
realistically represent non-respondents, I applied the 68% factor to their 
capacities, modified by whatever information was available about downtime at 
specific mills during 2008.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>&nbsp;The North American wood pellet 
sector is profiled in this paper. A small pellet industry has existed since the 
1930s, but its main growth occurred in the wake of the energy crisis in the 
1970s. Its current spurt is even greater, growing from 1.1 million metric 
tonnes in 2003 to 4.2 million 2008. It is set to reach 6.2 million in 2009. 
Most plants are small, relying on sawmill residues for fiber and thus are 
limited to 100,000 tonnes or less per year. A number of new mills have been 
built to process chipped roundwood and have capacities three to four times as 
large. Most pellets made in the United States are consumed domestically, but a 
growing offshore market is boosting exports. By contrast, most Canadian pellets 
are shipped overseas. The reliance on sawmill residues led to imbalances 
between supply and demand for fiber as the sawmilling sector retrenched in the 
2008-2009 recession. This has led mills to turn to roundwood or other 
non-sawmill sources of fiber. The wood pellet industry and use of wood pellets 
as energy are in their relative infancy in North America and the recent growth 
of both has been fueled by increases in the cost of fossil energy. However, 
policies aimed at reducing carbon dioxide emissions into the atmosphere could 
loom as bigger factors in the future.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>
&nbsp;In this paper, we take a preliminary look at techniques for comparing 
sorts that yield grades of lumber. We propose methodology that takes into 
account differences in grade prices and the costs associated with misgrading. 
We focus on two- and three-category sorts, but our results could be readily 
extended. We provide web links to sample FORTRAN implementations of this 
methodology for the case in which the strength predictor and strength have a 
bivariate normal distribution and the load distribution is also normally 
distributed. We indicate how these approaches would have to be modified for 
other predictor, strength, and load distributions.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>&nbsp;Timber products 
are vital in the construction, manufacturing, and shipping segments of the U.S. 
economy. Nearly all new houses are built principally with wood. Wood building 
products are also used extensively in the construction of nonresidential 
buildings and in the upkeep and improvement of existing structures. Solid wood 
is also used to produce, package, and transport manufactured products. In 2006, 
an estimated 6.8 billion ft3 (187.5 million m3) of solid wood products were 
consumed in the United States, down slightly from 2005 but more than twice the 
consumption in 1950. Over the period 1950 to 2006, the lumber share of total 
solid wood products consumption decreased from 73% to 69%, while the structural 
panel share increased from 14% to 18%. Nonstructural panel share remained 
unchanged. The share of lumber used for construction increased from 50% to 67% 
but remained the same or declined in other end-use areas. Structural panels 
share in construction remained about the same over the period 1950 to 2006, 
decreased in packaging and shipping (5% to 2%), and increased in the 'other' 
end-use category. The share of nonstructural panels used for construction fell 
from 68% to 43%, while increasing in manufacturing and other end uses.<br>

Abstract:</b>&nbsp;Using sustainable building materials is gaining a 
significant presence in the United States therefore proving sustainability 
claims are becoming increasingly more important. Showing wood products as green 
building materials is vital for the long-term productivity of the wood building 
industry. This study examined hardwood lumber manufacturing using Life-Cycle 
Inventory methodology. Material flow and energy type and use were identified 
for hardwood sawmills in the northeastern United States. A hardwood log volume 
conversion of 43.7% to planed dry lumber was found. Values of 608 MJ of 
electricity and 5,800 MJ of thermal energy per m3 were determined for the 
manufacturing of planed dry hardwood lumber burning mostly green wood residues 
on-site for energy. Emission data produced from modeling estimated biomass and 
fossil carbon dioxide production of 428 kg per m3 and 139 kg per m3, 
respectively. Increasing wood fuel use, a carbon-neutral process, would 
decrease the environmental impact of hardwood lumber manufacturing and increase 
its use as a green building material.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>&nbsp;Approximately 375 Douglas-fir and ponderosa pine logs, 3 
to 6 inches in diameter, were tested in third-point bending and in compression 
parallel to the grain. The moisture content at time of test was about 14 
percent. Good correlations were found between the modulus of elasticity (MOE) 
in static bending and those obtained by transverse vibration. Good correlations 
were also found between modulus ofrupture (MOR) and MOE. A species independent 
relationship was established between ultimate compression stress parallel to 
the grain and MOR. A mechanical grading system previously developed for 9-inch 
diameter logs was shown applicable to small-diameter logs.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>&nbsp;In the 
context of other recent years, 2006 turned out to be a relatively normal year 
for the U.S. hardwood chip market in terms of factors that influence supply and 
demand; such as prevailing weather conditions, energy price trends, and pulp 
and paper production. Gulf Coast hurricanes and rising energy prices drove 
hardwood chip and pulpwood markets in 2005, but weather was not a driving 
factor in 2006, and energy prices were subsiding by the second half of the 
year. With few local exceptions, rainfall across the South was below normal 
through the summer and fall (according to region-wide precipitation data from 
NOAA), yielding fairly normalweather conditions for timberharvesting.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>&nbsp;This paper explores the physical and economic potential 
to substitute anaerobically digested bovine biofiber (ADBF) for wood in the 
making of particleboard. Laboratory tests indicated that replacement of 
one-half the wood in particleboard with ADBF produced panels that compared 
favorably to the requirements for commercial particleboard performance 
(specified by ANSI Standard A208.1-1999). The economic question hinges on the 
opportunity costs of alternative uses for ADBF. The current use is primarily 
animal bedding, and prices appear to be greater than those paid by 
particleboard plants for sawdust and planer shavings but less than for chips. 
ADBF is most similar in size to, thus most likely to be substitutable for, 
sawdust and shavings. At current bedding values, use for particleboard appears 
a less favorable alternative. However, this could be overcome by large-volume, 
long-term contractual arrangements that provide a secure long-term outlet for 
excess ADBF fiber that may otherwise not have value. For a particleboard 
operation, the opportunity for fiber diversification and the incorporation of 
post-industrial waste in the process offer strategic advantages.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>&nbsp;This chapter discusses economic globalization and world 
trade in relation to forest sector modeling for the US/North American region. 
It discusses drivers of economic globalization and related structural changes 
in US forest product markets, including currency exchange rates and differences 
in manufacturing costs that have contributed to the displacement of global 
manufacturing capacity. It includes detailed discussion of paper and paperboard 
trends. Bilateral trade flows between the USA and Canada for all wood products, 
were modeled within the Timber Assessment Projection System, with currency 
exchange rate assumptions among key elements influencing projected trade. This 
chapter describes how assumptions about globalization and trade influenced 
model results, using examples of recent RPA Timber Assessments. Techniques and 
results of the Timber Assessment Projection System models are compared to those 
of a more general global trade model, the Global Forest Products Model (GFPM). 
The GFPM was used recently to project international forest sector developments 
conditional on the 2000 RPA Timber Assessment. The results showed that while 
the USA, Japan, and Europe were predicted to remain major importers of forest 
products out to 2030, the rapid economic growth of China would make it the 
world&#146;s largest market for raw wood and intermediate and final forest 
products. In a separate study, exchange rate assumptions were found to be 
important determinants of major US trade flows as projected by GFPM, 
particularly for manufactured commodities such as pulp and paper.<br>

it to other forest sector models. The NAPAP model was based on PELPS and 
adapted to describe paper and paperboard product demand, pulpwood and recovered

<b>Abstract:</b>&nbsp;Improving efficiency in 
the use of both wood and nonwood inputs has characterized the US forest sector 
over the last 50 years. This chapter explores methods used to reflect this 
pattern of technological change and others in the Timber Assessment Projection 
System models. The development and use of three types of technology projection 
methods are explained: (1) decomposition of technology into several processes 
and projection of future mixes of processes to make exogenous projections of 
technology change for harvesting costs and for solidwood products recovery and 
processing costs in TAMM; (2) activity analysis that uses alternate 
technologies capable of changing fiber input mixes to make endogenous 
projections of technology change for pulp, paper, and paperboard production in 
NAPAP; and (3) innovation diffusion modeling to endogenously project the change 
in wood-use rates in major end uses such as housing in TAMM. We provide an 
example of a sensitivity testing in a case where technology projections were 
made exogenously. Finally we discuss lessons learned and points to consider 
when deciding the type of technology projection methods to use.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>&nbsp;The coefficent of variation (COV) of a distribution with 
mean and variance 2 is defined as the noise to signal ratio or . (Sometimes 
this ratio is multiplied by 100 and reported as a percentage.) Building 
materials are often evaluated not only on the basis of mean strength but also 
on relative variability. Laboratory techniques are often compared on the basis 
of their COVs. Financial managers treat coefficients of variation as measures 
of risk to return. Thus, scientists, engineers, and portfolio managers are 
interested in obtaining confidence intervals on population COVs and in testing 
for the equality of COVs.<br>

<b>Abstract:
</b>&nbsp;The FTM-West ('fuel treatment market' model for U.S. West) is a 
dynamic partial market equilibrium model of regional softwood timber and wood 
product markets, designed to project future market impacts of expanded fuel 
treatment programs that remove trees to reduce fire hazard on forestlands in 
the U.S. West. The model solves sequentially the annual equilibria in wood 
markets from 1997 to 2004 and projects annual equilibria from 2005 to 2020 
using detailed assumptions about future thinning programs and market trends. 
FTM-West was designed specifically to account for economic complexities that 
stem from unconventional size distributions of trees and logs removed in 
thinning operations (compared with conventional timber supply in the West). 
Tree size directly influences market value and harvest cost per unit volume of 
wood; log size influences product yield, production capacity, and processing 
costs at sawmills and plywood mills. FTM-West provides a tool to evaluate 
future market scenarios for large-scale fuel treatment programs with various 
thinning regimes that may have varying costs and yield wood with divergent size 
class distributions. The model provides a capability to analyze and project how 
much harvestable wood the markets can absorb from thinning programs over time 
and the regional timber price and timber harvest impacts of expanded thinning 
under various assumptions about fuel treatment program subsidy or 
administrative costs, variations in thinning regime, or alternative projections 
of future product demands across the spectrum of products ranging from wood 
fuel to lumber, plywood, and wood fiber products.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>&nbsp;This 
paper identifies timberland areas in 12 western states where thinning 
treatments (1) are judged to be needed to reduce fire hazard and (2) may 'pay 
for themselves' at a scale to make investment in forest product processing a 
realistic option. A web-based tool-Fuel Treatment Evaluator 3.0-is used to 
select high-fi re-hazard timberland plots from the Forest Service Forest 
Inventory and Analysis Program (FIA) database and provide results of simulated 
thinning treatments. Areas were identified where either torching or crowning is 
likely during wildfires when wind speeds are below 25 mph. After additional 
screens are applied, 24 million acres are deemed eligible for treatment (14 
million acres on federal lands). Uneven-aged and even-aged silvicultural 
treatments analyzed would treat 7.2 to 18.0 million of the 24 million acres, 
including 0.8 to 1.2 million acres of wildland-urban interface area, and 
provide 169 to 640 million ovendry tons of woody biomass. About 55 percent of 
biomass would be from main stem of trees =7 inches d.b.h. Sixty to seventy 
percent of the area to be treated is in California, Idaho, and Montana. Volumes 
and harvest costs from two treatments on the 14 million acres of eligible 
federal lands are used as inputs to the fuel treatment market model for U.S. 
West (FTM-West) discussed in these proceedings.<br>

<b>Abstract:
</b>&nbsp;This report details the procedure used to estimate the roundwood 
products portion of U.S. annual timber harvest levels by using roundwood 
quivalents. National-level U.S. forest products data published by trade 
associations and State and Federal Government organizations were used to 
estimate the roundwood equivalent of national roundwood products production. 
The procedure for estimating roundwood equivalent of roundwood products is to 
calculate the 'roundwood equivalent' of solid wood products using recovery 
factors estimated from mill studies over the years. The procedure for 
estimating roundwood equivalent of products provides a simple technique for 
estimating the major portion of national timber harvest levels that is less 
expensive than conducting surveys and can be done on an annual basis. This 
technique provides a benchmark that can be used in conjunction with the Forest 
Inventory and Analysis survey approach, which helps ensure the accuracy of both 
methods. These national harvest levels were estimated by working backwards from 
U.S. national timber products production data using lumber recovery factors to 
derive the roundwood equivalent of harvest.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>&nbsp;The North American 
lumber market is integrated and, under normal conditions, provides unhindered 
access to all suppliers. North American log markets, in contrast, function on 
different principles: in one principle, a profit allowance for the wood 
processor plays a role in timber pricing, whereas in the other it is a 
byproduct of the give-and-take of arm&#146;s length market negotiations. Under 
the first system, markets are characterized by high elasticities of price 
transmission and, at times of market weakness, by low elasticities of product 
supply. Under the second system, the opposite of these benchmarks prevails. 
This can result in asymmetric supply responses in weak markets, to the 
detriment of U.S. producers. Whether this is a subsidy in the sense of 
conferring a direct financial contribution by the government or merely a more 
efficient pricing mechanism is beclouded by the dearth of market-based 
transactions. The challenge in the lumber dispute then is to devise a system of 
pricing in Canada that is more transparent in regard to the underlying 
valuation of timber. FOR.SCI. 52(4):443- 445.<br>

<b>Abstract:
</b>&nbsp;U.S. softwood lumber production was 35.2 billion BF in 2007, off U13% 
from its 2005 high, according to Western Wood Products Assn. Based on our 
tabulated capacity of 43.7 billion feet, that means the industry utilized 80% 
of its potential. The utilization rate of our top 200 U.S. producers for 2007 
was at a similar 83% while among all our respondents it was 82%. It is hard to 
generalize but, among our sample, board mills tended to do a little better than 
those tied mainly to framing/construction lumber, as did mills focused on 
treated wood, a market with stronger links to the more stable remodelling 
sector. Mills with their own fee timber also tended to operate at higher levels 
than those dependent on marketpurchases.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>
&nbsp;This report provides an index method that can be used to update recent 
estimates of timber harvest by state to a common current year and to make 
5-year projections. The Forest Service Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) 
program makes estimates of harvest for each state in differing years. The 
purpose of this updating method is to bring each state-level estimate up to a 
common current year. For each state, each of several components of harvest is 
updated to the current year. Estimate outputs are based on inputs from 
established models such as Timber Cut (TCUT) and historical wood products 
production data collected and compiled by the Forest Inventory and Analysis 
(FIA) program and the U.S. Forest Service Forest Products Laboratory. Because 
annual harvest data by state are not generally available for each year, the 
development of this indexing procedure based on national- and state-level 
primary product production data is needed to update U.S. annual timber harvest 
by state and region. This procedure is also needed for reporting annual harvest 
statistics and forecasts to the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe 
(UNECE) and the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). This paper reports the 
results in the development of historical and projected estimates of timber 
harvest. This new system of harvest estimation and index development is termed 
the harvest estimation system.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>
&nbsp;Structural and nonstructural panel products have constituted the fastest 
growing segment of the wood products industries over the past two decades. 
Based on announced plans, growth will accelerate in the next 2 years. The cost 
of wood fiber used in these processes has been rising. To keep wood costs as 
low as possible, a growing share of the new production is being channeled into 
regions where panel manufacturing has been low or nonexistent and where 
underutilized timber supplies are still available. There is also increasing 
interest in using agricultural fibers for panels, either to complement or to 
replace wood. The projected increases in production over the next 2 years are 
likely to exceed projected growth in demand, leading to an oversupply, at least 
temporarily. This paper summarizes capacity growth in various wood-based 
panels: Southern Pine plywood, oriented strandboard, medium density fiberboard, 
and particleboard. It also examines changes in the manufacturing costs and the 
emerging supply-demand balance through 1997.<br>

Abstract:</b>&nbsp;The model ChargeOut! was developed to determine charge-out 
rates or rates of return for machines and capital equipment. This paper 
introduces a costing methodology and applies it to a piece of capital 
equipment. Although designed for the forest industry, the methodology is 
readily transferable to other sectors. Based on discounted cash-flow analysis, 
ChargeOut! provides more accurate financial outputs than traditional 
single-period models. ChargeOut! produces a break-even charge-out rate that 
will return any specified after-tax real rate of return over the economic life 
of the capital equipment. Alternatively, given a negotiated charge-out rate, 
the model produces net present values and real and nominal rates of return 
before tax and financing, before tax, and after tax. It also compares the 
negotiated charge-out rate with the calculated break-even rate, incorporates 
inflation, accounts for depreciation, and automatically conducts a sensitivity 
analysis. Graphs illustrate the major cost centers and cash flows. The model is 
both automated and flexible. Interpretation of ChargeOut!'s results requires 
some knowledge of discounted cash-flow analysis. The target audience is 
financial professionals in the logging industry or equipment owners who have 
some background in engineering economics. ChargeOut! is illustrated using 
representative data from a logging skidder; however, the methodology could be 
adapted to find charge-out rates or rates of return for any piece of capital 
equipment.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>
&nbsp;ChargeOut!, a discounted cash-flow methodology in spreadsheet format for 
analyzing machine costs, is compared with traditional machine-rate 
methodologies. Four machine-rate models are compared and a common data set 
representative of logging skidders' costs is used to illustrate the differences 
between ChargeOut! and the machine-rate methods.The study found that the 
machine-rate methodologies were not standardized and the methodologies had 
differences in accounting for ownership, other fixed costs, and variable 
operating costs. The result was that two of the machine-rate models calculated 
hourly rates that were higher than needed to provide the specified return on 
capital, and two of the machine-rate models calculated hourly rates that were 
insufficient to provide the specified return. In contrast, ChargeOut!'s 
break-even rate returned exactly the specified return.Differences between the 
results calculated by the machine-rate methods occur because of different 
implicit assumptions used within the models' formus, largely because the 
machine-rate models are unable to properly incorporate the time value of money. 
Whereas ChargeOut! can be sufficiently constrained to approximately replicate a 
machine-rate calculation, doing so sacrifices much of ChargeOut!'s power and 
flexibility. Machine-rate models cannot be configured to replicate ChargeOut!'s 
calculations. Machine-rate models cannot be configured to calculate cash flows, 
allow for uneven costs or machine hours, incorporate loans that have a 
different life than the expected machine life, or perform an after-tax 
analysis. ChargeOut! can do all of these.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>
&nbsp;Unbleached kraft paperboard is produced from wood fiber in an industrial 
papermaking process. A highly specific and detailed model of the process is 
presented. The model is also presented as a working computer program. A user of 
the computer program will provide data on physical parameters of the process 
and on prices of material inputs and outputs. The program is then used to 
calculate material and energy requirements of the process, and to calculate 
related revenues and variable costs. The program does not derive capital costs 
or fixed costs. The program is most useful in estimating precisely the economic 
impact of changes in physical parameters of the process, changes in technology, 
or changes in related prices. As such, the model can be used to estimate the 
economic effect, on revenues and costs, of technological changes or changes in 
prices.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>&nbsp;The conversion factor generally used to convert logs 
measured in board feet to cubic meters has traditionally been set at 4.53. 
Because of diminishing old growth, large diameter trees, the average conversion 
factor has risen, as illustrated in this analysis of Washington state sawmill 
data over the period 1970-1998. Conversion factors for coastal and interior 
Washington were estimated at 6.76 and 5.93, respectively, up from 4.0 to 4.5 in 
the 1970s. Average sawlog diameters over the same period were estimated to have 
declined from 56 to 29 cm for coastal Washington and from 41 to 25 cm for 
interior Washington.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>&nbsp;This 
documentation is meant to accompany CVal, a downloadable spreadsheet tool. CVal 
was constructed for foresters, other land management advisors, landowners, and 
carbon credit aggregators to evaluate the direct benefits and costs of entering 
into contracts for carbon sequestered in managed forests and forest 
plantations. CVal was designed to evaluate Exchange Forestry Offset (XFO) 
contracts on the Chicago Climate Exchange (CCX), although the methodology ould 
be adapted for other trading mechanisms and agricultural sequestration 
projects. Versions of CVal are available both with and without macros. Although 
all calculations can be done in the version without macros, the macros version 
has buttons and automations that make the calculations convenient. Our general 
finding is that it is critical in managed forest projects to determine whether 
carbon accumulated prior to entering the contract can be counted. Depending on 
the contract year and length, this can triple the revenue from CCX contracts. 
If it is not possible to count pre-contract year carbon, then it may not be 
economically worthwhile to enter the program unless it is extended. Other 
critical variables having a large effect on the overall profitability include 
the trade price of sequestered carbon, the carbon sequestration rate, and the 
hurdle rate (the minimum required rate of return on investment) used. Up-front 
and annual costs are important, but overall profitability is not quite as 
sensitive to these costs as it is to the previously mentioned variables. Users 
are expected to enter their own data to evaluate the feasibility of specific 
projects.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>
&nbsp;Located in 23 countries, 40 forest-products research and development 
organizations outside the United States were reviewed in 2004 and 2005. The 
intent was to obtain a better understanding of how such organizations are 
structured and administered and their performance judged. Investing over $600 
million annually, the 40 organizations employed 7,000 to 7,500 scientists and 
supporting staff. Especially noteworthy about the organizations are the many 
ways in which they identify themselves (such as institutes, laboratories, 
centers); their long history of sustained involvement in forest products 
research; and their movement from public to private ownership (whole or in 
part). The distinction between public and private sector responsibility for 
research is blurry with these organizations, as often they have public 
sponsorship, yet private operation and management. They offer a wide range of 
services to clients yet have complex ownership and partnering arrangements. 
Their organizational structures are seemingly scrambled with forest product 
research subunits located within larger parent organizations (with broad 
multisector research responsibilities) and specialized services to a single 
major group of clients. These organizations have an intense desire to meet the 
needs of clients, and feature the following: synthesis of existing information 
as an important service; fees charged for services provided; strategic interest 
in clients located throughout the world; educational and degree-granting 
activities; multiple sources of income and revenue; diverse tandards for 
measuring performance; adept response to broad economic-social changes; 
multiple location of physical facilities; and differing degrees of publicly 
available information describing mission and operation of organizations.<br>

Abstract:</b>&nbsp;Small-scale gasification plants that generate electrical 
energy from forest health thinnings may have the potential to deliver 
substantial amounts of electricity to the national grid. We evaluated the 
economic feasibility of two sizes of BioMax, a generator manufactured by the 
Community Power Corporation of Littleton, Colorado. At current avoided- cost 
electricity prices in Oregon, it would not be economical to operate a 
small-scale (100-kW) BioMax without a subsidy or tax credit, even if fuel were 
delivered to the plant at a forest landing at no cost. Given a tax credit, a 
1,000-kW system could be operated profitably. If it were possible to sell 
merchantable logs (removed as part of forest health treatments) for an average 
of $175/thousand board feet, most acres on gentle slopes in southern Oregon 
would provide net operating surpluses. Most steeply sloped acres would generate 
operating deficits. If merchantable timber were sold separately, biomass from 
forest health thinnings on timberland in 15 western states could potentially 
provide from 2.3 to 14.3 billion kWh of electricity to the national grid. Our 
results suggest that if a forest landing is located near an existing power 
line, distributed energy generation is an option that may be worth considering.

<b>Abstract:</b>&nbsp;To reduce the risk of catastrophic fires, 
the USDA Forest Service and its partners are developing practical, economic 
uses for forest thinnings from National Forests and state and private lands in 
western states. Because mechanical thinning is costly, developing markets for 
removed wood as fuel for community energy applications is one way to support 
the economics of forest management while saving money for communities. By 
installing a wood heating system in the public schools in Darby, Montana, the 
Fuels for Schools Program is demonstrating the potential of putting low quality 
wood residues to practical use in a rural forest based community. The 
wood-fired heating system installed in Darby Schools replaced three separate 
oil-fired systems and saved the school district $24,500 of total fuel costs for 
the 2003-2004 year. Because of higher fuel oil prices, total fuel cost savings 
increased to $61,500 in the 2004-2005 heating season. Heating fuel costs were 
reduced from $0.63 per ft2 per year (last full oil heating season) to $0.36 and 
$0.35 per ft2 per year for the 2003-04 and 2004-05 heating seasons. Adjusting 
for heating degree days (HDD) for the respective heating seasons, the 
corresponding seasonal fuel costs in $/thousand ft2/HDD were reduced from 0.068 
in 2002-2003 to 0.040, and to 0.040 in the 2003-2004 and 2004-2005 heating 
seasons, respectively. In an analysis to show actual costs for a school, we 
found a payback period of 9.8 years based on 2004-2005 heating fuel values. The 
project life was for 20 years, and a desired discount rate of 8.0% was 
specified for determining the before tax net present value.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>&nbsp;A reference source is 
provided for estimating the amount of heat energy that may be recovered using 
wood or bark fuel in typical furnace and boiler or hot air combustion heat 
recovery systems. A survey of reported data on higher heating values for 
various species of wood and bark fuels is provided. A set of formulas of a type 
commonly used by combustion technologists is also provided for estimating 
combustion system heat losses and net recoverable heat energy per pound of fuel 
as-fired, based on fuel higher heating value, moisture content, and excess air 
stack gas temperature, and ambient temperature assumptions.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>&nbsp;A 
spreadsheet-based computer program called LamLum was created to analyze the 
economics of value- added laminated lumber manufacturing facilities. Such 
facilities manufacture laminations, typically from lower grades of structural 
lumber, then glue these laminations together to make various types of higher 
value laminated lumber products. This report provides the documentation for 
LamLum. LamLum may be downloaded from the USDA Forest Service, Forest Products 
Laboratory, website 
(www.fpl.fs.fed.us/documnts/fplgtr/fpl_gtr165/fpl_gtr165.html). Extensive 
screenshots from the program are presented in this documentation. LamLum 
incorporates discounted cash flow analysis to determine under what conditions a 
laminated lumber plant might be profitable. LamLum can also be used to aid in 
payroll and employment planning. Break-even analysis is incorporated to 
calculate the maximum amount that may be paid for laminations while still 
returning the required rate of return on invested capital to owners. Plant and 
equipment, raw materials, wages, administration costs, and working capital are 
linked to provide cash flow tables and summary financial measures for 
profitability analysis. A summary cash flow chart and a pie chart showing key 
cost categories simplify analysis. In addition to cash flows and basic 
financial measures, LamLum provides physical product flows with respect to both 
wood inputs and wood product outputs. LamLum is structured so that users may 
easily perform a sensitivity analysis on revenues and key costs without going 
into the detailed assumptions. Cost contingency factors allow major cost 
categories to be changed independently of the sensitivity analysis. Products, 
species and grades, and lamination costs may be changed over time to allow for 
changing resource requirements or availability and thereby provide flexibility 
in planning. Extensive built-in annotation in the spreadsheet provides guidance 
and help. Built-in warnings and error messages help reduce input errors and 
inform users when and why their results might not be believable.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>&nbsp;This report documents a simulation 
model of the plywood manufacturing process. Its purpose is to enable a user to 
make quick estimates of the economic impact of a particular process change 
within a mill. The program was designed to simulate the processing of plywood 
within a relatively simplified mill design. Within that limitation, however, it 
allows a wide range of options to be incorporated so as to customize the 
program to a variety of situations. The program should not be confused with a 
linear program-based optimization model. This program does not seek an optimum 
solution from a range of alternatives, but only makes calculations based upon 
user-entered assumptions.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>
&nbsp;Plywood manufacturing costs have increased over the years with inflation. 
In recent years, new technologies that improve productivity and reduce costs 
have become available. Cost data published by the American Plywood Association 
(APA) show moderating rates of increase by 1983. New data from a sample of 
western U.S. mills show that nonwood manufacturing costs have decreased since 
the 1983 APA estimates. Costs for sanded-plywood mills declined by 12 to 17 
percent between 1983 and 1988, while sheathing costs declined by 8 to 9 
percent. Sheathing mills were not included in this analysis. Therefore, these 
results apply primarily to mills with mixed sanded and sheathing capabilities.

Abstract:</b>&nbsp;Because of a combination of circumstances, there is an 
overabundance of small-diameter timber available in the United States. There is 
low demand for this material because it has low value. One way to increase the 
value, and therefore the demand, for this material is to develop or expand 
markets where the material can be used. We looked at markets where little or no 
machining would be required before use because this would make it more feasible 
to use small-diameter material. One such market is that of wood posts in 
highway applications. In this study, we gathered information on the current use 
of posts, both wood and those made from other materials, used in highway 
applications. Information was gathered using a survey of Department of 
Transportation engineers from across the United States. We then analyzed the 
information to assess the possibility of increasing the use of small-diameter 
timber in the highway application market. We found many opportunities for ways 
this market could be expanded, but we also found challenges to increasing this 
market.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>&nbsp;ASTM D1990, 
'Establishing Allowable Properties for Visually Graded Dimension Lumber from 
In-Grade Tests of Full-Size Specimens,' is the consensus standard used to make 
submissions of allowable properties for many U.S., Canadian, and foreign 
species to the Board of Review of the American Lumber Standards Committee. 
Recently, it has become apparent how difficult it is to perform the 
calculations for such a submission. Some calculations are clearly specified in 
the standard; in some cases the standard merely indicates a need to make an 
adjustment but does not specify how to do so. This report discusses in detail 
how to develop allowable properties under the standard in a manner that is 
consistent with current practice. Many calculations in the standard are 
difficult and errors are easily made, particularly when using a spreadsheet; 
this report introduces a set of computer programs that perform some of the 
difficult calculations, thereby reducing the potential for errors. These 
computer programs can be run over the World Wide Web, or Fortran versions of 
the programs can be downloaded, compiled, and run on a user's computer.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>
&nbsp;This report describes the current status of wood and paper recycling in 
the United States and predicts the production and market consequences of 
increased recycling. The results suggest that the rate of paper recycling will 
rapidly rise in the 1990s, mainly as a result of the competitive evolution of 
fiber markets and papermaking technologies. The consumption and export of paper 
and paperboard are also projected to grow, but imports are projected to 
generally decline. In the context of increased paper recycling, the production 
of lumber and structural wood panels is projected to increase. However, the 
greater demand for sawtimber, coupled with projected declines in timber harvest 
on National Forests, will result in higher softwood sawtimber stumpage prices. 
The information presented here was prepared for the United Nations Economic 
Commission in June 1994. Historical data were derived from various sources, 
including government agencies and industry trade associations. Economic 
projections were developed by the author and others in the USDA Forest Service.

<b>Abstract:</b>&nbsp;As of 
December 31, 2000, there were 603 buildings at Naval Station (NAVSTA) Norfolk 
with a combined floor area of nearly 17.3 million ft2. In one-third of these 
buildings, structural wood products were used in one or more major structural 
building applications, utilizing an estimated 11.6 million board feet of 
lumber, 0.4 million ft2 (3/8-in. basis) of structural panels, and 0.1 million 
ft2 (3/8-in. basis) of fiberboard. Wood buildings, on average, were about 40% 
smaller than their nonwood counterparts. They were also older. Half of all the 
buildings and three-fourths of all wood buildings pre-date 1950. The role of 
wood has greatly diminished at NAVSTA Norfolk over the past 50 years.<br>

associated with the wood using industry. One of the major uses of this data 
series is tracking technological change over time. One of the major technology 
shifts occurring in the wood using industry is the substitution of oriented 
strandboard for plywood in the structural panel sector. Some of the data show 
this shift. United States production of structural panels totaled 28.5 billion 
square feet in 1997. Oriented strandboard production increased from less than 3 
billion square feet in 1985 to 10.5 billion square feet in 1997. Plywood 
production was 20.1 billion square feet in 1985 before falling to 17.9 billion 
square feet in 1997.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>&nbsp;This report 
documents a package of computer programs called VENVAL. These programs prepare 
plywood mill data for a linear programming (LP) model that, in turn, calculates 
the optimum mix of products to make, given a set of technologies and market 
prices. (The software to solve a linear program is not provided and must be 
obtained separately.) Linear programming finds the best solutions for a given 
set of circumstances. This paper illustrates and describes the software 
programs of VENVAL and its use in LP for softwood plywood mill operations.<br>

the West. They occupy 48% of the commercial forestland, hold 63% of the 
region's softwood growing stock, and contribute 48% of its net annual growth. 
But in California, Idaho, Montana, Oregon, and Washington, timber sales have 
declined from an average of 8 billion board feet per year during 1960-1 990 to 
about 1.5 billion board feet since. The new millennium saw the lowest volumes 
offered since the Great Depression at less than 700 million board feet. This 
paper looks at historical contributions of the National Forests to the region's 
timber supply and at contemporary prospects for supply in the context of the 
recently developed National Fire Plan.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>&nbsp;A method is suggested for 
estimating additions to carbon stored in harvested wood products (HWP) and for 
evaluating uncertainty. The method uses data on HWP production and trade from 
several decades and tracks annual additions to pools of HWP in use, removals 
from use, additions to solid waste disposal sites (SWDS), and decay from SWDS. 
The method is consistent with IPCC guidance for estimating emissions from SWDS. 
Uncertainty is postulated in the form of probability density functions for 14 
variables, using Monte Carlo simulation. A method is suggested for estimating 
additions to carbon stored in harvested wood products (HWP) wood products, the 
factor used to convert products to carbon, and the proportion of solidwood and 
paper in SWDS. Uncertainty in the use (service) life of solidwood products has 
a limited effect because an error offsets changes in products in use and in 
SWDS. The method provides a starting point for meeting the aims of the IPCC 
Good Practice Guidance.<br>

<b>Abstract:
</b>&nbsp;The TAMM/NAPAP/ATLAS/AREACHANGE(TNAA) system and the Forest and 
Agriculture Sector Optimization Model (FASOM) are two large-scale forestry 
sector modeling systems that have been employed to analyze the U.S. forest 
resource situation. The TNAA system of static, spatial equilibrium models has 
been applied to make SO-year projections of the U.S. forest sector for more 
than 20 years. Much of its input on forest management behavior and decisions 
about use of forestland derives from expert-based systems external to the TNAA 
system. FASOM, a spatial intertemporal optimization model, directly 
incorporates decisions on management investment and land use options relative 
to agricultural alternatives as endogenous model elements. The paper contrasts 
projections of private forest investment from the TNAA and FASOM models, 
focusing on the southern United States. Comparison of the TNAA base case and an 
investment restricted scenario from FASOM, both of which reflect a continuation 
of recent behavioral tendencies by nonindustrial private owners, suggests that 
Southern private timberlands have considerable biological and economic 
potential for intensified forest management. Unrestricted FASOM projections 
confirm that added investment could lead to substantially larger timber harvest 
volumes and lower prices than those projected in the base/restricted cases. But 
even under the more intensive investment scenarios, naturally regenerated 
forests would cover three-quarters of the future private timberland base and 
hardwoods would continue to dominate the inventory structure.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>&nbsp;The 
finite difference approximation is applied to estimate the moisture-dependent 
diffusion coefficient by utilizing test data of isothermal moisture desorption 
in northern red oak (Quercus rubra). The test data contain moisture 
distributions at discrete locations across the thickness of specimens, which 
coincides with the radial direction of northern red oak, and at specified 
times. Also, the rate of moisture variation at each specified time and location 
must be known or correctly estimated. The functional form of the diffusion 
coefficient as well as the boundary conditions at the surfaces are not known a 
priori. The resulting system of finite difference equations defines an inverse 
problem, whose solution may be sensitive to small changes of input data. 
Results indicate that the diffusion coefficient increases with increasing 
moisture content below the fiber saturation point, which defines the upper 
limit applied by the diffusion theory.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>&nbsp;Noted forest products industry researcher 
and writer says the conversion factor traditionally used to convert logs 
measured in board feet to cubic meters has risen. In the U.S., most timber is 
measured in terms of board feet. The log scales currently in use to estimate 
lumber recovery from roundwood, however, were created in the 19th century 
according to sawmill technology, timber resource and lumber sizes used at the 
time. Because log scales have not been modified since to reflect changes in 
these factors, they are outdated and inadequately serve their purpose of 
accurately determining recoverable lumber volumes.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>&nbsp;The United States 
has a century of experience with the development of models that describe 
markets for forest products and trends in resource conditions. In the last four 
decades, increasing rigor in policy debates has stimulated the development of 
models to support policy analysis. Increasingly, research has evolved (often 
relying on computer-based models) to increase understanding of consumer 
demands, producer behavior, landowner behavior, and conditions of the timber 
resource. Greater computational power available since the mid 1970s has allowed 
the evolution of bioeconomic models that combine economic and resource models. 
These are used in the United States to provide the basis for forecasting future 
resource and market trends and to inform policy analysis. These more complex 
models have also extended options for policy analysis using approaches such as 
scenario planning to help decision makers gauge uncertainty.<br>

<br><b>Abstract:</b>&nbsp;Annual paper and paperboard output climbed by 2.2% in 
the EU/EFTA subregion in 2003, a record year for European papermakers, while 
the subregion's woodpulp output climbed by 2.8%. Higher paper and paperboard 
exports from the EU/EFTA subregion to non-UNECE countries, and a 16% increase 
in net exports in 2003, propelled expansion of output. Paper and paperboard 
consumption in central and eastern Europe was boosted by stronger regional 
economic growth in 2003, but the region also experienced a large increase in 
imports. Consumption of paper and paperboard in the Russian Federation 
increased by 12.1% in 2003, while production increased by 6.2%. Although 
Russian paper and paperboard exports greatly exceed imports in tonnage, the 
trade balance in product value continued to deteriorate in 2003, with 
increasing higher valued imports. Annual paper and paperboard output in North 
America receded by 1.2% in 2003, but output climbed in the second half of the 
year and the first half of 2004. With the exception of shipments to China and 
other countries in Asia, excluding Japan, total Canadian pulp, paper and 
paperboard product shipments to all major destinations declined. Paper and 
paperboard tariffs were set to disappear by the year 2004 and are at zero 
according to GATT (Uruguay Round of 1994), but punitive tariffs and an array of 
non-tariff barriers still exist, sometimes arising from trade disputes with a 
scope wider than the sector itself. Central and eastern European countries' 
exports of paper and paperboard grew more than in the other UNECE subregions, 
boosted by successful preparations for EU accession and investments in capacity 
by global pulp and paper industries.<br>

Abstract:</b>&nbsp;Sawlogs in the United States, whether scaled on the ground 
or cruised on the stump, have traditionally been measured in terms of their 
lumber yield. The three commonly used measurement rules generally underestimate 
true recoveries. Moreover, they do so inconsistently, complicating the 
comparisons of volumes obtained by different board foot rules as well as by the 
cubic rules used internationally. In particular, for smaller log diameters, the 
undercount of board foot volume by US log scales can rise sharply. As sizes 
available to sawmills have declined, the ratios between scaled and actual 
volumes have changed. Thus, the factors used to convert volumes from one system 
to another have become outdated. A transition to cubic would improve domestic 
log market transparency by reducing the worst inequities of board foot scales 
and making regional comparisons easier, and would create a level playing field 
internationally.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>&nbsp;If America had Canada's stumpage system, then 
there wouldn't be much of a dispute. But the reality is there are two distinct 
models of timber valuation, and the core of America's complaint 
vis-&agrave;-vis Canada is that, as a result, there is an asymmetry in the 
market where the two sides compete: on the one hand all producers have equal 
access under the same rules and standards to the U.S. lumber market, but at the 
timber supply level a different and exclusionary Canadian lumber pricing model 
provides wood at rates that disadvantage U.S. competitors. Canadians 
acknowledge that Canada has a competitive advantage in the way it prices 
timber, but claim it's not a subsidy.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>&nbsp;The 
deterioration of heartwood from live and dead Alaska yellow-cedar trees was 
evaluated by exposing ministakes in soils at field sites in Alaska and 
Mississippi for 2 and 4 year intervals. Southern yellow pine sapwood served as 
a control. The vastly greater deterioration, as measured by weight loss, in 
Mississippi compared to Alaska (60 and 10 percent after 4 years, respectively) 
was attributed to warmer temperatures, a longer growing season, and perhaps the 
presence of termites. The wood from Alaska yellow-cedar trees dead 26 years did 
not differ in deterioration from the wood from live cedar trees, but wood from 
cedar trees dead 81 years experienced an intermediate deterioration between 
these classes and the pine controls. Slow changes in heartwood chemistry 
following tree death probably explain these differences for Alaska yellow- 
cedar. The results from this and several related studies indicate that 
heartwood from dead Alaska yellow- cedar trees is suitable for many indoor and 
outdoor applications long after tree death, but wood from live or dead cedar 
trees does not perform particularly well in contact with soil.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>&nbsp;A 
model of the U.S. forestry and agricultural sectors is used to simulate the 
consequences of growing short-rotation woody crops on agricultural lands as a 
fiber source for pulp and paper production. Hybrid poplar, a short-rotation 
woody crop, annually produces 4 to 7 dry tons per acre of hardwood pulpwood 
over a 6- to 10-year rotation. When harvested, the material competes with 
pulpwood from traditional forests. The model- estimated optimal acreage varies 
from 1.5 to 2.8 million acres, less than 1 percent of cultivated U.S. cropland 
and less than 1 percent of U.S. existing timberland. That acreage generates 
about 10 to 16 million dry tons per year, depending on decade, and represents 
about 40 percent of current U.S. hardwood pulpwood output. The short-rotation 
woody crop production causes reallocation of existing forest lands across 
forest species types and ownerships. This level of short-rotation woody crop 
production reduces the timber management intensity of U.S. forests and promotes 
migration of some existing timberland into agricultural production.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>&nbsp;The growth of pulp and paper mills 
in the US from 1970 to 2000 depended mostly on size and age. Mills grew 
according to Gibrat's law, and post-1970 mills grew faster than pre-1971 mills. 
Mills stopped growing at approximately 22 years of age. But most mills survived 
beyond that, thus growth was not necessary for survival, but characteristic of 
the early phase of the mill life cycle. Less integrated mills grew slower. So 
did more specialized mills and more so if they produced mostly paper. Mill 
location was uncorrelated with growth, but location mattered indirectly by 
facilitating or hindering mills with growth-conducive characteristics.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>&nbsp;A practical method for tracking the 
effect of curtailment announcements on lumber supply is described and tested. 
Combining announcements of closures and curtailments with mill capacities 
enables the creation of accurate forward-looking assessments of lumber supply 1 
to 2 months into the future. For three American and Canadian lumber- producing 
regions, the method produced projections of supply that were within 0.5 percent 
accuracy for a 7-month period encompassing June to December 2000. Announcements 
of production intentions are an important piece of market intelligence that can 
help guide assessments of demand-supply in a volatile market environment.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>&nbsp;Using sustainable building materials is gaining a 
significant presence in the US. This study examined hardwood lumber 
manufacturing using life-cycle inventory methodology. Material flow and energy 
use were identified for hardwood sawmills in northeastern US. A hardwood log 
volume conversion of 43.7% to planed dry lumber was found. Values of 608 MJ/m3 
of electrical and 5800 MJ/m3 of thermal energy were determined for the 
manufacturing of planed dry hardwood lumber where mostly green wood residues 
were burned on-site for energy. Emission data produced from modeling estimated 
biomass and fossil CO2 production of 428 and 139 kg/m3, respectively. 
Increasing wood fuel use, a carbon-neutral process, would lower the 
environmental impact of hardwood lumber manufacturing and increase its use as a 
green building material.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>&nbsp;Several spans of a 60-year-old 
open-deck timber railroad bridge on the Southern Pacific Railroad Line (now the 
Union Pacific) in Southwest Texas were field tested. The tests were conducted 
with the sponsorship and cooperation of the Association of American Railroads 
to determine the vertical live load distribution characteristics of the 
superstructure. The bridge was originally constructed with Douglas-fir larch 
solid sawn stringers but was rehabilitated on several occasions to allow 
comparisons to be made with respect to different rehabilitation options, 
including the use of a helper stringer and the use of glued laminated timber 
(glulam) stringers. The test spans measured approximately 4.1 m (13.5 ft) 
center-to-center of supports and included two closely bpackedc chords, each 
consisting of four timber stringers (one test span included an additional 
helper stringer added to one chord). One chord was made up of glulam timber and 
the other was made up of solid sawn timber. The bridge superstructure was 
generally in satisfactory condition, with some stringer horizontal splitting 
noted over the bents. The bents were in reasonably good condition, but chord 
bearing was uneven on bent caps. Static and dynamic deflection load test data 
were obtained using a special test train. The test results indicate that the 
glulam chord performed better than the older sawn stringer chord, even when a 
helper stringer was added. Individual stringers within a chord did not always 
share the load equally.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>&nbsp;The repair and 
remodeling of residential units in the existing housing stock is an important 
market for wood products. Included are many, and varied repair and remodeling 
activities and projects, some of which require substantial amounts of wood 
products, some of which do not. Currently, about 24 percent of all lumber, 23 
percent of all structural panels, 15 percent of all nonstructural panels, and 
lesser amounts of engineered wood products consumed in the United States are 
used for residential repair and remodeling. This market has become much more 
important in recent years as the Nationas housing stock has grown larger, its 
average age has increased, and homeowner incomes have risen.<br>

<br><b>Abstract:</b>&nbsp;The concept of land expectation value developed by 
Martin Faustmann may serve as a paradigm for outcome-based performance measures 
in public forest management if the concept of forest equity value is broadened 
to include social and environmental benefits and costs, and sustainability. 
However, anticipation and accurate evaluation of all benefits and costs appears 
to present significant challenges, as revealed in the history of public forest 
policy in the United States. While public forest managers are unlikely to adopt 
performance measures based on forest equity value, an understanding of this 
concept may help shape the future direction of public forest management.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>&nbsp;In economics, primary inputs or factors of 
production define the term &#145;resources.' Resources include land resources 
(plants, animals, and minerals), labor, capital, and entrepreneurship. Almost 
all pulp and paper fiber resources are plant materials obtained from trees or 
agricultural crops. These resources encompass plant materials harvested 
directly from the land (wood, straw, bamboo, etc.), plant material byproducts 
or residuals from other manufacturing processes (wood chips from sawmills, 
bagasse fiber from sugarcane processing, cotton linter, etc.), and fibers 
recovered from recycled paper or paperboard. Some relatively expensive nonplant 
fibers derived from mineral resources are also used in papermaking (e.g., 
synthetic plastic fibers) but very small quantities and only in some 
specialized paper or paperboard products. Resources derive value from their 
utility in producing goods or services, but utility varies among different 
fiber resources and utility varies as technology and product demands shift over 
time. Different plant fibers have different physical properties that influence 
their utility in pulping and papermaking. Utility of industrial resources also 
depends on profitability, or availability of resources at competitive market 
prices. Market demands for fiber products and supplies of fiber resources vary 
over time, and thus the market value and utility of fiber resources are 
variable over time. Some resources have competing multiple uses and alternative 
values in society. Forest resources have value in producing a range of 
different wood products, not just pulp and paper products. Forest resources 
also have alternative values in society because they produce other important 
services such as recreational, spiritual, environmental, or aesthetic services. 
For example, selected species of trees grown in monoculture (single-species) 
plantations may have high intrinsic value in pulping or papermaking because of 
uniformity in fiber quality or desirable fiber characteristics, but cultivating 
trees in plantations can be more expensive than relying on natural regeneration 
of trees in a forest. The typically more heterogeneous mixture of tree species 
found in a naturally regenerated forest may have less intrinsic value in 
pulping or papermaking because of less uniformity or less desirable fiber 
characteristics, but may have utility in any case because of lower cost. 
However, a natural forest will likely have high value to society in terms of 
ecological or aesthetic amenities. Also, advances in plantation systems or 
biotechnology can yield faster-growing trees or more desirable trees for 
pulping, which can affect the market value of fiber resources. The actual 
market values of wood and fiber resources are determined by shifting patterns 
of resource abundance and overall demand. This article describes various 
categories of fiber resources used for pulp and paper products, factors 
influencing their utility and relative market values, and trends in fiber 
resource supply and demand.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>&nbsp;The ability of forest products 
research and development organizations to contribute to a nation's well-being 
requires that they be well organized, effectively managed, and held to high 
standards of performance. In order to obtain a better understanding of how such 
organizations are structured and administered, and how they judge 
organizational performance, a review of forest products and related research 
organizations beyond the boundaries of the United States was undertaken in 
2004-2005. Ninety-three research organizations were initially identified for 
review, 40 of which were selected for in-depth examination (located in 23 
countries) (Table 1). They were selected in order to: (a) provide a sampling of 
organizations operating in various countries worldwide, (b) enable review of 
publicly and privately sponsored organizations, and (c) permit access to a 
diversity of organizational structures and administrative procedures. The lead 
administrator of each organization was given an opportunity to review the draft 
narrative describing the organization. In addition, each lead administrator was 
asked to provide advice about structural, managerial, and performance 
conditions that are considered necessary if a forest products research and 
development organization is to accomplish its mission. Thirty administrators of 
the 40 organizations reviewed willingly provided commentaries.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>&nbsp;The 
ability of forest products research programs to contribute to a nation's 
well-being requires that research organizations be well organized, effectively 
managed, and held to high standards of performance. In 2004-2005, a review of 
forest products and related research organizations beyond the boundaries of the 
United States was carried out. The intent was to obtain a better understanding 
of how such organizations are structured, administered and their performance 
judged. Ninety-three research organizations were initially identified for 
consideration by the review, 40 of which were chosen as case examples (located 
in 23 countries)and subsequently described in substantial detail. Provided with 
widely accepted principles of administration and organizational design, the 
lead administrators of the case-example organizations willingly provided advice 
about structural, managerial and performance conditions that are necessary if a 
forest products research enterprise is to effectively accomplish its mission. 
The organization and administration of forest products and related research 
organizations in the United States can benefit from the experiences of similar 
organizations located beyond the nation's boundaries. In this respect, 
especially noteworthy among foreign organizations engaged in forest products 
research are the many ways in which they identify themselves (such as 
institutes, laboratories, centers); long history of sustained involvement in 
forest products research; movement from public to private ownership (whole or 
in part); blurry distinction between public and private sector responsibility 
for research; public sponsorship, yet private operation and management; wide 
range of services made available to clients; complex ownership and partnering 
arrangements; seemingly scrambled organizational structures; extensive use of 
subsidiaries and joint ventures; forest product research subunits located 
within larger parent organizations (with broad multi- sector research 
responsibilities); specialized services to a single major group of clients; 
intense desire to meet the needs of clients; synthesis of existing information 
as an important service; fees charged for services provided; strategic interest 
in clients located throughout the world; engaged in educational and 
degree-granting activities; multiple sources of income and revenue; diverse 
standards for measuring performance; adept response to broad economic-social 
changes; multiple location of physical facilities; and differing degrees of 
publicly available information describing mission and operation of 
organizations.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>&nbsp;The purpose of this chapter is to discuss 
forestry implications of SRWC based on an economic analysis. As with the 
development of paper recycling, anticipating forestry implications of 
agricultural SRWC will depend in part on anticipating market conditions and 
economic impacts of technological developments. This chapter presents an 
analytic framework and market outlook for agricultural SRWC as wood fibre crops 
in the USA and considers some potential implications for forestry.<br>

<b>Abstract:
</b>&nbsp;This paper presents FTM-West, a partial market equilibrium model 
designed to project future wood market impacts of significantly expanded fuel 
treatment programs that could remove trees to reduce fire hazard on forestlands 
in the U.S. West. FTM-West was designed to account for structural complexities 
in marketing and utilization that arise from unconventional size distributions 
of trees and logs removed in fuel treatment operations as compared with 
conventional timber supply in the West. For example, tree size directly 
influences market value and harvest cost per unit volume of wood, whereas log 
size influences product yield, production capacity, and processing costs at 
sawmills and plywood mills. Market scenarios were projected by FTM-West for two 
hypothetical fuel treatment regimes that yield wood with divergent size class 
distributions, evaluated at two hypothetical levels of administrative cost or 
government subsidy. Results suggest that timber markets could economically 
utilize substantial volumes of wood from hypothetical treatment programs, even 
without any subsidy. Given an optimistic overall market outlook, model results 
indicate potential for expansion of total wood harvest in the West if fuel 
treatment programs will permit significantly expanded wood supply from forest 
thinning, in which case fuel treatment programs could partially displace timber 
harvest from conventional supply sources (mainly state and private 
forestlands), reduce timber prices, and offset regional timber revenues, while 
expanding regional forest product output.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>&nbsp;The North American 
Pulp And Paper (NAPAP) model and USDA POLYSYS agricultural policy analysis 
model were linked to project future market scenarios for pulpwood supply from 
agricultural short-rotation woody crops in the United States. Results suggest 
that pulpwood supply from fast- growing hybrid poplars and cottonwoods will 
become marginally economical but fairly limited in the next several decades. 
This supply could become significant under certain scenarios, such as reduced 
hardwood pulpwood supply from natural forests or limited future expansion in 
paper recycling. Woody crops might also be developed as feedstock for fuels or 
chemicals, but competitive development of hybrid poplars for such markets would 
require higher biomass feedstock values than current market values.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>&nbsp;As in other industries, the 
fortunes of the U.S. pulp and paper industry are now closely tied to the global 
economy. The U.S. pulp and paper sector exhibits fairly steady production and 
growth trends, but its economic fortunes have become intertwined with the 
bglobal cyclec of supply and demand. Exposure to the global cycle has increased 
for the U.S. in recent decades with increased levels of U.S. product exports. 
One effect of this exposure in recent years is increased market volatility 
associated with trade-related adjustments in export demands and capacity 
utilization. Price volatility and sensitivity of profits to the global cycle 
are related to capital intensity and competitiveness in the pulp and paper 
sector. The recent economic downturn (the so called Asian decline) caused a 
number of significant bripple effectsc throughout the pulp and paper sector 
that are linked to the global cycle of supply and demand.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>&nbsp;Approximately 720 sawmills produce 
most of the softwood lumber in the U.S. The largest 200 of these, ranked mostly 
according to 2002 production, are displayed in the table on the ensuing pages. 
Where the actual production statistic was not released, it was estimated by 
subtracting from capacity any lost volume due to downtime. In a few instances 
where neither production nor indications of downtime were available, capacity 
was used to compile the listing. This year the Hampton mill in Willamina, Ore. 
came out on top. According to a company source the 385MMBF output would have 
been even greater but for some downtime taken during the year. The highly 
regarded independent producer Seneca Sawmill in Eugene, Ore. came in second. 
It, however, dropped its third shift in April 2003. Weyerhaeuser's Cottage 
Grove, Ore. complex rounds out the top three. The long-time leader, the Simpson 
complex in Shelton, Wash., was estimated to have fallen to fourth due in part 
to downtime taken in the course of the year.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>&nbsp;Over the last 50 years many changes 
have roiled lumber markets. On the positive side, treated lumber has created 
major opportunities for lumber use in outdoor applications. But some negative 
developments underscore the mature status of lumber as a commodity. Sheathing 
had been lost long ago to panels. Likewise, roof rafters and joists have been 
supplanted by less wood-intensive trusses. More recently, lumber use in floor 
joists has been shrinking due to replacement by wood I-Joists, while in the 
girder, beam and header segment, LVL has been taking large shares. Similarly, 
in outdoor decking, there is increasing competition from woodfiber-plastic 
composites. And that's not even to mention the increasing inroads made by 
imports. Yet, despite these challenges, the U.S. lumber industry grew 
(capacity-wise) by a respectable average of 2% pes year over the past decade. 
This was 50% faster than population growth and about two-thirds the growth rate 
of GDP.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>&nbsp;Global pulp, paper and paperboard 
markets improved in 2004 and 2005, as indicated by generally higher prices for 
most pulp, paper and paperboard products in comparison with 2003. While growth 
in demand was quite robust in 2004, by the end of the first half of 2005, 
markets appeared more hesitant and prices appeared to waver or reach a plateau. 
Within the UNECE region, annual growth in consumption of paper and paperboard 
halved within the CIS subregion (from 12.9% in 2003 to 6.5% in 2004), while 
growth rebounded in North America (from -0.7% to 4.5%). Thus, there were 
converging rates of growth in apparent consumption of paper and paperboard for 
Europe, North America and the CIS subregion.<br>

Abstract:</b>&nbsp;The purpose of this chapter is to describe the reasons for 
the development of ICT and e-business systems in the paper and paperboard 
packaging industry and to discuss future scenarios that may serve to guide 
forest- sector research in this topical area. The paper and paperboard 
packaging industry encompasses producers of primary paper and paperboard 
packaging materials (paper and paperboard mills) plus secondary producers who 
convert paper or paperboard into packaging products, such as corrugated 
containers, boxes, sacks, or other forms of paper or paperboard packaging. Some 
firms in the industry are vertically integrated, being both primary paper or 
paperboard producers and secondary converters. Beyond general reasons for the 
development of ICT and e-business systems, the chapter focuses on ICT and 
e-business developments that are unique to the packaging industry, for 
instance, the ongoing development of 'active' or 'intelligent' packaging 
systems. Several hypotheses are explored regarding the market consequences of 
ICT developments for primary paper or paperboard producers, leading to a set of 
speculative future scenarios. Forest sector research needs are identified in 
relation to those market scenarios, including the need for 1) economic models 
to evaluate market impacts of ICT and e-business developments and 2) research 
on how to identify and take full advantage of ICT and e-business applications 
in the context of competitive corporate strategies.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>&nbsp;The 
North American lumber market is integrated and, under normal conditions, 
provides unhindered access to all suppliers. North American log markets, in 
contrast, function on different principles: in one principle, a profit 
allowance for the wood processor plays a role in timber pricing, whereas in the 
other it is a byproduct of the give-and-take of arm's length market 
negotiations. Under the first system, markets are characterized by high 
elasticities of price transmission and, at times of market weakness, by low 
elasticities of product supply. Under the second system, the opposite of these 
benchmarks prevails. This can result in asymmetric supply responses in weak 
markets, to the detriment of U.S. producers. Whether this is a subsidy in the 
sense of conferring a direct financial contribution by the government or merely 
a more efficient pricing mechanism is beclouded by the dearth of market-based 
transactions. The challenge in the lumber dispute then is to devise a system of 
pricing in Canada that is more transparent in regard to the underlying 
valuation of timber.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>&nbsp;The U.S. has 
historically been a net importer of wood and paper products. During the 1990's, 
the U.S. trade deficit widened, implying an increasing U.S. impact on timber 
harvests in foreign supply regions. An analysis was made of historical and 
projected trends in U.S. consumption and trade in terms of the roundwood volume 
required to make products consumed and traded. Results show that historically, 
the U.S. has increased its net imports and that the estimated harvest of 
roundwood overseas to make imports to the U.S. has increased faster than the 
estimated reductions in overseas harvest due to exports of U.S. products 
overseas. However, Draft projections from the USDA Forest Service RPA Timber 
Assessment indicate net imports may slowly decrease and level off after 2010 
and remain level through 2050. Likewise, the net roundwood harvest overseas 
associated with our net imports may decrease and remain stable through 2050.<br>

Abstract:</b>&nbsp;Large amounts of woody residues and wood waste are generated 
annually in the United States. In 2002, an estimated 240 million metric tons 
was generated during the extraction of timber from the Nation's forests, from 
forestry cultural operations, in the conversion of forest land to nonforest 
uses, in the initial processing of roundwood timber into usable products, in 
the construction and demolition of buildings and structures, and in the 
manufacture, use, and disposal of solid wood products. Much of this material is 
indeed waste, but increasingly large shares are becoming valuable resources. 
The major sources of waste wood are timber harvesting and processing residues, 
which include woody forest residues and primary timber processing mill 
residues, and urban wood waste, which includes construction and demolition 
(C&amp;D) waste and municipal solid waste (MSW). Each type of waste wood 
differs in recyclability. Timber harvesting and processing generated nearly 178 
million metric tons of woody residues in 2002, with 86 million metric tons 
being unused and deemed available for recovery. In comparison, urban waste wood 
in the MSW and C&amp;D waste streams generated 63 million metric tons of waste 
wood, with 27 million metric tons remaining unused and deemed available for 
recovery. These estimates are based on published waste generation rates and 
recoverability, measures of economic activity, and trends in virgin wood use in 
specific markets. Waste wood from other lesser sources and debris from 
catastrophic natural events, which may be disposed of outside the primary waste 
streams, are not included in this report.<br>

<b>Abstract:
</b>&nbsp;This paper addresses the economics of forest fuel thinning programs 
on federal lands in the U.S. West, and presents a model of regional timber and 
product market impacts. The issue of economics is vital to the debate about 
fire management, and this paper presents market implications of two alternative 
silvicultural strategies, even-aged and uneven-aged thinning. Projections are 
based on are regional market model called FTM&#151;West (Fuel Treatment Market 
model&#151;West), which uses the method of price-endogenous linear programming 
to project annual market equilibria for softwood timber and wood products in 
the western United States from1997 to 2020. The model takes into account 
variability in tree and log size, as well as economic effects of variable size 
class on harvest costs, log value, product recovery and mill capacity. Results 
show large potential market impacts from expanded thinning on federal lands, 
but impacts vary by silvicultural regime due to differences in size-class 
distributions of trees available under different thinning regimes. A 
hypothetical even-aged thinning program ('thin-from-below' strategy) results in 
net negative market welfare over the projection period (2005-2020), while a 
hypothetical uneven-aged thinning program (thinning based on stand density 
index) results in positive net market welfare. Net welfare results are the same 
over a range of different subsidy and administrative fee assumptions. An 
implication is that even-aged thinning regimes on federal lands in the U.S. 
West are less economical and therefore will be less effective.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>&nbsp;For softwood lumber producers 2006 
was an 'interesting' year, but mostly in the Chinese proverbial sense of the 
word. This is illustrated by the top U.S. producer, the Hampton Affiliates 
sawmill in Willamina, Ore. It receives double kudos for remaining the top 
producer, but also for being the one among the top 30 that cut back the most, 
thus doing its share to keep a badly oversupplied market balanced. Its 2006 
total of 426MMBF was down 12% from its previous year's total. Overall, the 200 
mills for which we had both 2005 and 2006 data showed a drop in production of 
almost 6%. Capacity utilization was just 90%.<br>

<b>Abstract:
</b>&nbsp;Consumption of wood fiber in pulp, paper and paperboard increased in 
the United States over the past century and is projected to increase well into 
the next century at a decelerating rate of growth. Harvest of pulpwood on 
forest land is the single largest source of wood fiber, followed by recycled 
paper and wood residues. In the past decade, wood residues declined in supply 
while use of recycled paper increased rapidly. Use of recycled paper is 
projected to increase more steadily in the future with slower growth in paper 
recovery for recycling. Harvest of pulpwood on forest land is projected to 
remain the dominant source of U.S. fiber supply through the first half of the 
next century. Softwood pulpwood harvest on forest land is projected to increase 
as U.S. softwood residue supplies decline. Pulpwood stumpage values are 
projected to increase in the United States, based on supply and demand 
analysis, gradually improving economic opportunities for growing hardwood 
short-rotation woody crops on agricultural land. Hardwood pulpwood harvest on 
forest land is projected to increase for several decades but then decline in 
the long run with increasing fiber supply from agricultural short-rotation 
woody crops. Canada is projected to remain the principal source of U.S. pulp 
and paper imports, which are projected to increase. Most Canadian domestic 
pulpwood supply is projected to remain wood residues, as Canadian lumber 
production and residue output are projected to increase in the future. Pulpwood 
harvest in Canada is projected to decrease with modest additional increases in 
paper recycling.<br>

<br><b>Abstract:</b>&nbsp;Predictor sort experiments attempt to make use of the 
correlation between a predictor that can be measured prior to the start of an 
experiment and the response variable that we are investigating. Properly 
designed and analyzed, they can reduce necessary sample sizes, increase 
statistical power, and reduce the lengths of confidence intervals. However, if 
the non- random nature of the predictor sort is not taken into account, 
problems can occur. In particular, standard one-sided lower confidence bounds 
on quantiles of a normal distribution are overly conservative in a predictor 
sort situation. For lumber strength applications, this leads to 'allowable 
properties' that are too low. We have developed asymptotic theory that yields 
the correct k value in the y - ks approach to obtaining a confidence bound. The 
resulting confidence bounds have coverages that approach the nominal values 
faster than bounds based on maximum likelihood estimation. In a subsequent 
paper we will provide k values that are appropriate for small sample sizes.<br>

<b>Abstract:
</b>&nbsp;The use of recovered paper has an influence on the amount of timber 
harvested as well as the feasibility of expanded recycling programs. During the 
1990's markets and prices for recovered materials have fluctuated widely. There 
are a number of factors driving these market changes including economic 
conditions domestically and internationally. The objective of this study was to 
develop recovered paper supply functions for the five principal grades of 
recovered paper by focusing on the effects of the spot and contract markets in 
establishing domestic prices for recovered paper. Two supply functions were 
estimated for each grade in each of three U.S. supply regions - North, South, 
and West. For these three United States supply regions, recovered paper supply 
consists of two elements namely, 'long-term contract' and 'spot market' supply 
which are estimated with two separate equations. The results of these 
estimations were incorporated into the North American Pulp and Paper Model 
(NAPAP).<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>&nbsp;The RPA Timber Assessment 
projects, over the next 50 years, the likelihood of increasing relative use of 
imported forest products versus U.S. roundwood harvest to meet U.S. consumption 
needs, although our projected consumption needs are now estimated to be lower 
than we projected in 1993. The projected higher imports relative to U.S. 
roundwood harvest is due in part to slower projected increase in available 
hardwood inventory and harvest in the South. Softwood harvest is projected to 
increase notably with increasing area and management intensity for plantations 
in the South, and we project higher softwood harvest than we did in 1993. U.S. 
roundwood harvest to meet domestic and export demands is projected to increase 
from 18.0 to 22.4 billion cubic feet (24%) over the next 50 years (less than 
one-third the annual rate of the past 44 years). All the projected increase in 
roundwood harvest comes from non-sawtimber, most from non-industrial land, and 
most from the South. To offset current net imports of forest products would 
require 14% more than current harvest be provided for domestic use by 
redirecting harvest used for exports or by increasing harvest. By 2050, this 
requirement increases to 36% of roundwood harvest.<br>

Abstract:</b>&nbsp;The Draft RPA Timber Assessment projects, over the next 50 
years, the likelihood of increasing abundance of softwoods in the South and 
decreasing abundance of hardwoods in the South. These trends in supply, along 
with projected contributions from the North and West, imply U.S. consumption 
needs could be met without increasing net product imports and would not 
increase softwood timber prices over the next 50 years. However, under this 
scenario, the adequacy of timber supplies depends on 1) continued expansion of 
softwood plantations with increased management intensity in the South, 2) 
moderation of hardwood use in the South, and 3) continued improvement in 
technology both to grow trees and to obtain more wood and paper product output 
per unit of timber input. The outlook has many forest management implications. 
For example, with relatively abundant supplies of wood fiber in the East, there 
would be little likelihood of expansion of pulp or OSB capacity in the West to 
use large volumes of small-diameter timber.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>&nbsp; Pulp and paper 
markets in the UNECE region were influenced by higher energy prices and demand 
growth in Asia in 2005 and 2006. Important developments in Europe included the 
launching of the EU Emissions Trading Scheme, which was followed by substantial 
increases in electrical energy prices. High global energy prices pushed up 
costs of production and prices for pulp, paper and paperboard, with price 
increases absorbed by relatively strong global market demands. China continues 
to be a growing source of global demand for wood fibre, including recovered 
paper, which China imports in large volumes from the UNECE region. The European 
pulp and paper industry is deeply involved with the implementation of the 
Lisbon Agenda to improve the competitiveness of European industry, for 
instance, through the drafting of a Strategic Research Agenda. European 
producers of paper and paperboard set a new record for output, at 104 million 
m.t. in 2005, growing slowly by 0.4% from 2004. In 2005 in North America, 
output of paper and paperboard decreased by 1.5% to 101.1 million m.t. from 
2004, although prices continued to increase in 2005 and the first half of 2006. 
In June of 2006, the International Council of Forest and Paper Associations 
announced the signing of an agreement by its global member companies on 
sustainability. Continued expressions of interest in sustainable forest 
management by forest and paper associations (and by customers of paper and 
paperboard products) suggest that related public procurement policies for paper 
and paperboard might become more common in the future. Production and 
consumption of pulp and paper declined in both the United States and Canada in 
2005, but the production decline was much greater for Canada (-4.5%) than the 
United States (-0.8%).<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>&nbsp;This long-range 
outlook derives from analysis of pulp and paper markets and pulpwood demands 
for wood panels. The analysis projects modest increases in pulpwood demand 
beyond 2010, with decelerating growth in paper and paperboard consumption; 
increased demand for pulpwood in wood panels; increased imports of pulp, paper, 
and paperboard; and little additional growth in paper recovery for recycling. 
Results point to expanded pulpwood markets, particularly for softwoods in the 
US South, but to limited expansion of pulpwood markets elsewhere in the United 
States.<br>

<b>Abstract:
</b>&nbsp;We make use of Cramer conditions together with the well-known local 
quadratic convergence of Newton's method to establish the asymptotic closeness 
of k-step Newton estimators to efficient likelihood estimators. In Verrill and 
Johnson [2007. Confidence bounds and hypothesis tests for normal distribution 
coefficients of variation. USDA Forest Products Laboratory Research Paper 
FPL-RP-638], we use this result to establish that estimators based on Newton 
steps from [square root]n- consistent estimators may be used in place of 
efficient solutions of the likelihood equations in likelihood ratio, Wald, and 
Rao tests. Taking a quadratic mean differentiability approach rather than our 
Crame&acute;r condition approach, Lehmann and Romano [2005. Testing Statistical 
Hypotheses, third ed. Springer, New York] have outlined proofs of similar 
results. However, their Newton step estimator results actually rely on unstated 
assumptions about Cramer conditions. Here we make our Cramer condition 
assumptions and their use explicit.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>&nbsp;The U.S. economy 
entered a period of slow growth in 2000, tilting toward economic recession in 
2001, the first broad economic downturn in a decade. This recent downturn was 
associated with a recession in U.S. industrial output from 2000 through 2001. 
U.S. paper and paperboard production declined from 1999 to 2001, with total 
production 8% lower in 2001 than the historical peak in 1999. The recession in 
manufacturing and downturn in paper and paperboard were linked to an 
exceptionally strong U.S. dollar, which attracted a flood of imported goods, 
limited growth in exports, and contributed to an exceptionally large U.S. trade 
deficit. The slowdown in the overall U.S. economy offset domestic demand for 
paper and paperboard and compounded the trade effects of the strong dollar. 
Mill closures and capacity reductions helped forestall what might otherwise 
have been a complete market rout for paper and paperboard commodities, but wood 
pulp and pulpwood prices all but collapsed. A turnaround in the economy was 
widely anticipated and appeared to be underway in the first half of 2002, but 
the downturn has already had a fairly profound impact, particularly in terms of 
expectations for growth in the pulp and paper sector, and also for pulpwood 
markets of the South. Longer-term economic issues and implications for pulpwood 
markets are discussed in this paper.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>&nbsp;Red maple (Acer rubrum) is a 
medium-sized tree 15 to 20 meters (50 to 65 feet) high and 30 to 60 centimeters 
(12 to 24 inches) in diameter with a generally fairly clear trunk. This species 
and silver maple (Acer saccharinum) are often called 'soft maples' to 
distinguish them from the higher density sugar and black maples that are 
commonly referred to as 'hard maples'. Other soft maples are boxelder (Acer 
negundo) and big leaf maple (Acer macrophyllum), but they are not commonly 
found as commercial items in the Northeast and Lake States. Red maple is 
characteristic of swampy sites, but it also thrives on drier locations. In the 
Northeast it is found commonly with white pine and northern hardwoods on 
moderately moist, sandy loam soils. As a consequence, this species is one of 
the most abundant and widespread trees of eastern North America. Its rapid 
growth leads to maturity within about 80 years.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>
&nbsp;Globalization of the sawn softwood sector continues as we ride the crest 
of the wave, characterized by generally positive markets worldwide. In North 
America, market conditions for sawn softwood are booming, fuelled by a robust 
housing sector; however, the ongoing trade dispute between the United States 
and Canada is dampening this generally positive outlook. The mountain pine 
beetle epidemic that rages in British Columbia, Canada continues, with 
approximately 4.8 million hectares of forestland currently infested and 
government policies regarding harvesting approaches being enacted as rapidly as 
possible. Demand for sawn softwood in the increasingly important Chinese market 
continues to grow, providing market opportunities for exporters of both 
sawnwood products and logs. Japanese sawn softwood consumption increased in 
2003 for the first time since 1995 because of short-term increases in housing 
starts: European sawnwood exports to Japan reached record levels in 2003. 
Markets for sawn softwood in Europe remain strong and Nordic producers fared 
well in 2003, particularly Sweden, whose sawnwood output neared record levels 
of 17 million m3, in spite of increased competition from Russia and the Baltic 
countries and due largely to increased marketing efforts in the United Kingdom. 
The eastern European countries and Russia continue to re-define the global 
marketplace for sawn softwood, as foreign investments in these regions all 
along the forestry supply chain ramp up their ability to compete worldwide. A 
United States government ban on CCA-treated sawnwood in residential 
applications goes into effect in 2004, leaving wood preservers to seek 
alternative wood preserving solutions. The outlook for sawn softwood markets in 
2004 is being impacted by the interplay of lower housing demand, increased 
roundwood supplies and a weaker US dollar. Based on historical trends, it is 
possible that higher North American prices for sawn softwood could still 
prevail through the first quarter of 2005, followed by a return to more normal 
pricing.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>&nbsp;As of July 2005, the 
main stream of the softwood lumber industry in the U.S. and Canada consisted of 
about 1,067sawmills. These sawmills had a combined capacity of 189 million m3 
(80 billion BF), employed about 99,000, produced about 172 million m3 (nominal, 
73 billion BF) of lumber, and in the process consumed about 280 million m3 of

<b>Abstract:</b>&nbsp;The Intergovernmental Panel on 
Climate Change (IPCC) provides guidelines for countries to report greenhouse 
gas removals by sinks and emissions from sources. These guidelines allow use of 
several accounting approaches when reporting the contribution of harvested wood 
products (HWP) under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. 
Using extensions of methods suggested by the IPCC and a software model called 
WOODCARB II in Microsoft Excel, this paper presents estimates of the U.S. HWP 
contribution to annual greenhouse gas removals in the agriculture, forestry, 
land use, and land use change sector. In 2005, the contribution to removals was 
30 Tg (million metric tons) C (carbon) and 31 Tg C for the Production and 
Atmospheric Flow Approaches, respectively, and 44 Tg C for the Stock Change 
Approach. This range is 17 to 25 percent of C removals by forests, or would 
offset 42 percent to 61 percent of residential natural gas C emissions in 2005. 
The contribution has declined under the Production and Atmospheric Flow 
Approaches since 1990 and has increased under the Stock Change Approach. The 
Stock Change estimate has increased because it explicitly includes C in 
increasing net imports of wood and paper products. The contribution estimates 
were validated by adjusting the half-life of products in use in order to match 
independent estimates of carbon in housing in 2001 and annual wood and paper 
discards to solid-waste disposal sites (SWDS) during 1990 to 2001. Estimates of 
methane emissions from wood and paper in landfills were also checked against 
independent estimates of total landfill methane emissions. A Monte-Carlo 
simulation used to assess the effect of uncertainty in inputs suggests the 90 
percent confidence interval for removal contribution estimates under the three 
approaches is within -23% to +19%.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>&nbsp;Leaching of wood preservatives 
affects the long-term efficacy and environmental impact of treated wood. Soil 
properties and wood characteristicscan affectleaching of woad preservatives, 
but these effects are not well understood. This paper reports a statistical 
analysis of the effects of soil and wood properties on leaching of arsenic (As) 
and copper (Cu) from southern yellow pine sapwood treated with chromated copper 
arsenate (CCA-C). Specimens were leached by an accelerated laboratory method 
for 12 weeks in soil obtained from different locations or in water. Loss of Cu 
and As was measured using X-ray fluorescence and correlated with various 
physical and chemical soil properties. Leaching was greater from specimens with 
higher initial As and Cu retentions. Average Cu loss was approximately equal to 
or greater than As loss for specimens exposed to soil: for specimens leached in 
water, As loss was about twice that of Cu loss. Generally, more Cu leaching 
occurred from specimens in soil contact compared to specimens in water, 
suggesting that ground-contact leaching studies of the new copper-rich systems 
should employ soil-based methods for realistic depletion measurements. The 
amount of As and Cu leached was influenced by soil properties. Depletion of Cu 
and As from CCA-treated woad appears to be differentially related to various 
soil properties as well as to initial As and Cu retention in the wood. This 
research will help develop a standard laboratory method for soil-contact 
leaching of metals from CCA and other copper-based preservative systems.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>&nbsp;USDA Forest Service 
analysis finds 104 million tons of woody residuals available for recovery in 
the U.S., with wood in MSW and C&amp;D debris streams comprising 28 million 
tons. The U.S. Department of Agriculture Forest Service conducts a variety of 
analyses to estimate the quantity of woody residuals in the United States. Its 
Forest Products Laboratory in Madison, Wisconsin does research to estimate the 
types and amounts generated, and what portion of those tonnages are available 
for recovery. The data from these analyses are very useful to wood recycling 
enterprises. They help in identifying sources to process, and markets for 
services that help foresters clear and pro-cess the downed woody debris that 
otherwise poses a significant fire threat. This article provides highlights of 
the data collected. Major sources of solid waste wood gener- ated in the U.S. 
that are analyzed by the Forest Products Laboratory include munici-pal solid 
waste (MSW), construction and de-molition debris, primary timber processing 
mill residues, and logging residues. The next step is to estimate what is 
recoverable. Recoverability is defined as total waste gen-erated, less amounts 
currently recovered, combusted or considered unusable. Table 1 summarizes the 
findings of each of the sources of solid waste wood.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>&nbsp;The hardwood chip 
market gained some stability in the first half of 2004 with a modest upturn in 
hardwood pulp production and as timber supply emerged from the dampening clouds 
of unusually wet weather that prevailed throughout the Eastern United States in 
2003. Although U.S. pulp production and exports increased in 2004, the hardwood 
pulp market began to show signs of saturation in the second half of the year, 
as hardwood market pulp prices peaked around mid-year. Weather also again 
became an issue in the third quarter with the late summer arrival of hurricane 
season in the South.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>&nbsp;The North American Pulp and Paper industry continues to 
experience challenges and changes much like most other business sectors of the 
hardwood industry. Marketing policies and the raw material supply chain of 
pulpwood and chips are being affected. The issues surrounding supply for 
pulpwood and chips have a broad reach in affecting timber and log purchases, 
logging contractors and sawmill operations throughout the hardwood industry, 
particularly in the Southern region. Availability and pricing of timber and 
logs can be impacted by positive or negative factors surrounding the pulpwood 
and chip supply. The success of many logging contractors depends on pulpwood 
markets. If pulpwood is not in demand or is impacted by negative price 
circumstances, logging contractors may not be able to operate. A resulting loss 
of qualified loggers can have a long term impact on overall timber and log 
supply. Fewer qualified loggers can mean that available timber and/or log sales 
are restricted or delayed by the harvesting process. Pulpwood and chip supply 
issues also have a direct bearing on sawmill operations, not only due to the 
log availability but because the consistent sale and pricing of hardwood 
residue chips can be an integral part of their business.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>&nbsp;The 
Hampton Affiliates sawmill in Willamina, Ore. again tops the list for output by 
a single U.S. mill for 2005. Its 486 MMBF not only outdid some 660 other 
significant US. sawmills, but also its own production of 473 million in 2004. 
Only a few mills in British Columbia and Germany are in this volume range. This 
marks the fourth consecutive year that Hampton's Willamina mill has won the 
'national title.'<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>&nbsp;There is increasing interest in 
preservative pressure-treatment of framing lumber to prevent attack by decay 
fungi and insects. However, the Spruce- pine-Fir species group that is often 
used in framing construction can be difficult to penetrate with preservatives. 
We compared solution uptake and penetration of boron and copper from a 
borax-copper (BC) preservative to that of boron in a disodium octaborate 
tetrahydrate (DOT) treatment and copper in a chromated copper arsenate (CCA) 
treatment. For all wood species, average solution uptake was consistently 
greater with the DOT solution than with the BC or CCA solution. Average boron 
penetration with DOT was also greater than that for any BC solution. 
Immediately after treatment, boron penetration with DOT exceeded 10 mm in at 
least 80% of specimens, indicating that the treatment could meet American Wood 
Preservers' Association (AWPA, 2003) penetration standards. Following a 2- week 
diffusion period, boron in BC treatments also met or exceeded AWPA standards in 
most cases. Copper penetration was much lower than boron penetration and did 
not meet AWPA standards in any species. Collapse was noted in some specimens 
treated with heated BC and DOT solutions.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>&nbsp;This paper reviews 
demand and supply trends for hardwood fiber in the United States. The objective 
is to illustrate nationwide shifts in demand and supply and show how the 
hardwood pulpwood market reacts to those shifts at a regional level. Thus, the 
market situation is illustrated using an economic rationale, and trends are 
projected under assumptions about future shifts in demand and supply. Results 
indicate the market is recovering from a major structural shift in demand, a 
downturn over the past decade driven by economic globalization, and also by 
increased paper recycling since the 1980s. Another long-run demand-side 
influence is expansion of hardwood fiber use at oriented strandboard mills. On 
the supply side, hardwood timber inventories are large but timber growth rates 
are relatively low (compared with softwoods). Hardwood resource ownership is 
increasingly diverse, and investment in hardwood resource productivity is 
fairly limited. Investment in short-rotation hardwood fiber crops could play a 
larger role in the future, but that potential appears to depend on the U.S. 
trade outlook and future growth in pulp and paper demand. In the interim, 
supply-side factors such as weather and precipitation combine with business 
cycles on the demand side to determine short-run market behavior.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>&nbsp;Although timber 
production has grown steadily over the last decade, information about the use 
of timbers and the corresponding resource remains in short supply. This study 
adds to the available literature on solid sawn timbers by compiling data on 
timber production and uses. The major categories of solid sawn timbers 
researched were railroad ties, timber bridges, and other transportation 
structures. The outlook seems relatively bright for railroad ties. The demand 
for wood railroad ties has grown with the railroad industry, and there is no 
reason to think that this demand will not continue to grow for many decades to 
come. Of all uses of solid sawn timbers, timber bridges have the least 
promising outlook. Steel and concrete are the major materials used by the 
bridge industry. Other markets for solid sawn timbers are smaller than that for 
railroad ties, and timbers in these markets will also face competition from 
other materials. The research reported here helps quantify an important segment 
of the wood products industry in the U.S. economy.<br>

<br><b>Abstract:</b>&nbsp;Between 1985-1995 a substantial number of multifamily 
housing units in the Eastern and Southern U.S. experienced problems with 
thermally degraded fire-retardant-treated (FRT) plywood roof sheathing. A 
series of studies conducted at the USDA Forest Service, Forest Products 
Laboratory (FPL), examined the materials, chemical mechanisms, and process 
implications and has developed both practical and theoretical solutions for 
controlling strength effects during treatment and processing and for minimizing 
strength loss in-service. In addition to a series of technical publications, 
FPL research contributed to the development of four new ASTM/ANSI 
performance-based qualification standards to address performance issues as well 
as two new American Wood Preservers' Association (AWPA) standards to address 
treatment processing and strength-effect limits. Currently, field 
serviceability issues that have been quantified are being combined with 
formerly developed kinetic degradation models to predict service-life of FRT 
constructions.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>&nbsp;A review of market 
history shows that southern pine sawtimber stumpage prices have increased by 
over 150 percent in this decade (Timber Mart South). Concurrently, some (i.e. 
Cubbage and Abt (1996) Nilsson et al (1999)) have questioned the adequacy of 
southern timber supplies to meet projected demands, which are projected to 
increase by about 25 percent over the next two decades. Given what we know 
about inventories and growth rates, what are the prospects for supplies to meet 
the needs of the southern pine industry?<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>&nbsp;Low-rise nonresidential building construction is an 
important market for lumber, structural wood panels, nonstructural wood panels, 
and engineered wood products in the United States. This report examines 
low-rise nonresidential buildings of four or fewer stories only, because 
buildings with five or more stories are normally severely restricted by 
building code from being wood framed. In 2003, 1,324 million board feet of 
lumber, 56 million bf of glulam timber, 2,293 million square feet, 3/8-in. 
basis, of structural panels, 76 million square feet, 3/8-in. basis of 
nonstructural panels, 49 million linear feet of wood I-joists, and nearly 3 
million cubic feet of structural composite lumber were used to construct 82,000 
new buildings or additions, and in the alterations and renovations of numerous 
existing buildings. Included are the construction of entirely new buildings, 
major additions to, or in conjunction with, existing buildings, and alterations 
and renovations to existing buildings. Volumes include allowances for onsite 
waste and loss. Not included are the amounts of wood used for facilitation 
(concrete forms, shoring, etc.) and millwork. Farm construction and nonbuilding 
construction, such as bridges, dams, and highways, were not included in this 
study.<br>

<br><b>Abstract:</b>&nbsp;Preliminary figures of wood-based panels consumption 
in Europe show a small increase in 1999 to 52.1 million m3 a new record level. 
However, according to the European Panel Federation (EPF), real consumption 
taking into account particle board stock changes, was higher due to the 
recovery of markets in the second half of 1999. Particle board is the main 
panel in Europe with over 67% of total consumption. Consumption of MDF and OSB 
set record levels. MDF was up 10.7% to 7.14 million m3 and OSB increased by 43% 
to just under 1 million m3. In North America trends show a continued strong 
performance for the wood-based panel sector in 1999 reaching 55.6 million m3. 
OSB and MDF have continued their expansion. Dr. Henry Spelter from the USDA, 
Forest Products Laboratory has contributed to this chapter by analyzing trends 
for the different panel products in North America using as a frame of reference 
the concept of life cycle. The analysis shows that while softwood plywood has 
reached maturity and is at present in a declining phase, particle board is 
still a mature product OSB and MDF, on the contrary, are new products with 
rapid market penetration and are substituting other wood products. The 
secretariat thanks Dr. Spelter for his contribution. Wood-based panels 
consumption in the Russian Federation. has increased to 3.0 million m3 in 1999. 
Higher production levels, mostly of particle board contributed to this 
increase, but overall consumption remains well below 1992 levels.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>&nbsp;Part I of this paper identifies 
timberland areas in 12 western states where thinning treatments are judged to 
be needed to reduce fire hazard and may 'pay for themselves'' at a scale to 
make investment in forest product processing a realistic option. We also 
estimate amounts of biomass removed and costs of removal. Part II of this paper 
estimates the market impact if biomass is supplied from treatments on federal 
land. In Part I, a web-based tool -Fuel Treatment Evaluator 3.0 -was used to 
select high fire hazard timberland plots from the Forest Service Forest 
Inventory and Analysis Program database and provide results of simulated 
thinning treatments. Areas were identified where either torching or crowning is 
likely during wildfires when wind speeds are below 25 mph. After additional 
screening, 24 million acres were deemed eligible for treatment (14 million 
acres on federal lands). Uneven-aged and even-aged silvicultural treatments 
analyzed would treat 7.2 to 18.0 million of the 24 million acres, including 0.8 
to 1.2 million acres of wildland-urban interface area, and provide 169 to 640 
million oven dry tons of woody biomass. About 55 percent of biomass would be 
from the main stem of trees greater than or equal to 7 in. diameter at breast 
height. Sixty to seventy percent of the area to be treated is in California, 
Idaho, and Montana. Part II of this paper uses volumes and harvest costs from 
two treatments on the 14 million acres of eligible federal lands as inputs to 
the Fuel Treatment Market model for the U.S. West to determine market impacts. 
Results indicate markets would use more material from uneven-aged thinnings 
than from even-aged thinnings and reductions in conventional harvest and timber 
prices would be greater for a program of uneven-aged thinnings. Economic 
welfare, as computed by wood products producer gains minus timber seller 
losses, would increase under uneven-aged thinning but decline under even-aged 
thinning.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>&nbsp;Large amounts of 
woody residues and solid wood waste are generated annually in the United States 
from the extraction of timber from forests, from forestry cultural operations, 
in the conversion of forest land to nonforest uses, in the initial processing 
of roundwood timber into usable products, in the construction and demolition of 
buildings and structures, and in the manufacture, use, and disposal of solid 
wood products in the municipal solid waste stream (MSW). Much of this material 
is indeed waste, but large, increasing shares are now becoming valuable 
resources. Here we examine the two major sources of waste wood from roundwood 
in the United States- woody forest residues and primary timber processing mill 
residues. These two sources generated a combined total of nearly 178 million 
metric tons of woody residues in 2002, with 86 million metric tons being unused 
and deemed available for recovery. In comparison, urban waste wood in the MSW 
stream and the construction and demolition (C&amp;D) of buildings and 
structures generated 63 million metric tons of waste wood, with 27 million 
metric tons remaining unused and deemed available for recovery. These estimates 
are based on published waste generation rates and recoverability, measures of 
economic activity, and trends in virgin wood use in specific markets. Waste 
wood from lesser sources and from catastrophic natural events that may be 
disposed of outside of the normal waste streams are not examined here.<br>

<b>Abstract:
</b>&nbsp;Minimizing wood shrinkage is a priority for many wood products in 
use, particularly engineered products manufactured to close tolerances, such as 
wood propellers for unmanned surveillance aircraft used in military operations. 
Those currently in service in the Middle East are experiencing performance 
problems as a consequence of wood shrinking during long-term storage at low 
equilibrium moisture content conditions prior to installation. To evaluate the 
extent of shrinkage, seven sugar maple (Acer saccharum) veneer propellers were 
dried from 11% to 3% moisture content in a controlled environment of 150&deg;F 
(65&deg;C) for 3 days. Two of these wood propellers were encased in 
polyethylene bags. Results showed 5 to 20 times more shrinkage for the 
thickness of the propeller hub and the hub face perpendicular to the propeller 
blades (across the grain), respectively, compared with the hub face parallel to 
the blades (along the grain). Two hubs, coated with aluminum oxide paint, 
showed dimensional changes similar to those observed for uncoated hubs. For the 
two wood propellers encased in polyethylene bags, moisture loss was slowed 
during the course of the experiment by roughly 46%. Wrapping the wood 
propellers prior to shipping would slow moisture desorption, thereby minimizing 
shrinkage during short-term storage. Processing the propellers at a lower 
equilibrium moisture content would minimize shrinkage during long-term storage.

<b>Abstract:
</b>&nbsp;Urban tree and woody yard residues are an important component of the 
municipal solid waste (MSW) stream in the United States. In 2000, approximately 
14.5 million tons of urban tree and woody yard residues was generated, nearly 
7% of total MSW. Some woody residues are being recovered for recycling, 
composting, or other uses, but a large proportion is simply discarded. In 
total, urban tree and woody yard residues form a resource about as large or 
larger than the current timber harvest from National Forests. Materials from 
each of these two sources have distinctly different properties and, in general, 
are not interchangeable. Urban tree and woody yard residues are typically 
suited for low value products such as mulch, while National Forest timber is 
suited for high value solid wood and pulp products. In 2000, just over 12 
million tons of timber was harvested from National Forests, compared to 14.5 
million tons of urban tree and woody yard residues generated.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>&nbsp;The traditional 
method of measuring log volume in North America is the board foot log scale, 
which uses simple assumptions about how much of a log's volume is recoverable. 
This underestimates the true recovery potential and leads to difficulties in 
comparing volumes measured with the traditional board foot system and those 
measured with the cubic scaling systems used in most of the world. The 
relationships among these different scaling systems vary systematically with 
log diameter, as well as length, taper, defects, and measurement and 
utilization conventions. As average log size has declined in North America due 
to the replacement of virgin wood by plantation-grown timber, the discrepancies 
have become larger. This article deals with the factors that affect the 
translation of traditional board foot log volumes to cubic volume and weight 
equivalents.<br>

<b>Abstract:
</b>&nbsp;For normally distributed populations, we obtain confidence bounds on 
a ratio of two coefficients of variation, provide a test for the equality of k 
coefficients of variation, and provide confidence bounds on a coefficient of 
variation shared by k populations. To develop these confidence bounds and test, 
we first establish that estimators based on Newton steps from n-consistent 
estimators may be used in place of efficient solutions of the likelihood 
equations in likelihood ratio, Wald, and Rao tests. Taking a quadratic mean 
differentiability approach, Lehmann and Romano have outlined proofs of similar 
results. We take a Cramer condition approach and make the conditions and their 
use explicit.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>&nbsp;Certain issues in recent softwood 
lumber trade negotiations have centered on the method for converting estimates 
of timber volumes reported in cubic meters to board feet. Such conversions 
depend on many factors; three of the most important of these are log length, 
diameter, and taper. Average log diameters vary by region and have declined in 
the western United States due to the growing scarcity of large diameter, 
old-growth trees. Such a systematic reduction in size in the log population 
affects volume conversions from cubic units to board feet, which makes 
traditional rule of thumb conversion factors antiquated. In this paper we 
present an improved empirical method for performing cubic volume to board foot 
conversions.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>&nbsp;Several analyses 
have shown that fire hazard is a concern for substantial areas of forestland, 
shrubland, grassland, and range in the western United States. In response, 
broadscale management strategies, such as the National Fire Plan, established 
actions to reduce the threat of undesirable fire. Available budgets are 
insufficient to pay for vegetative management on all acres where fire threat is 
considered unacceptable. The purpose of this report is to begin to identify 
locations in the west where fire hazard reduction treatments have a potential 
to 'pay for themselves' at a scale and over a long enough time to make 
investment in additional forest product processing infrastructure a realistic 
option. The resulting revenues from these activities could presumably subsidize 
treatment for other locations. Accordingly, we concentrate on areas where wood 
removed during fire hazard reduction treatments has the potential to support a 
forest products infrastructure. Areas for treatment were selected by the 
criterion where either torching or crowning is likely during wildfires when 
wind speeds are below 25 mph. We considered thinning treatments designed to 
result in either evenaged or uneven-aged stand conditions. If there are 
ecological limitations on basal area that is allowed to be removed and there is 
a need to obtain a certain amount of merchantable wood volume to help cover 
costs, then uneven-aged treatments appear more likely to achieve one of our 
hazard reduction targets. Thinning to maintain an uneven-aged structure could 
be more controversial because it removes larger trees, although the revenue 
from such treatment covers harvest costs more frequently than does revenue from 
thinning to maintain an even-aged structure. The removal of large trees by 
uneven-aged thinning may be reduced by supplementary treatments to increase 
torching index rather than thinning to reach a high crowning index. Treatments 
analyzed would treat 7.2 to 18.0 million acres, including 0.8 to 1.2 million 
acres of wildland urban interface area, and would provide 169 to 640 million 
oven-dry tons of woody biomass (e.g., main stem, tops, and limbs). About 55% of 
biomass would be from sawlogs. Sixty to 70% of acres to be treated are in 
California, Idaho, and Montana. To prepare an example estimate of annual 
harvest amount for the 12 selected western states, we assume acres needing 
treatment are divided into two parts of equal area. For half the acres, an 
uneven-aged treatment would be applied if at least 300 ft3 of merchantable wood 
is removed; for the other half, an even-aged treatment would be applied if at 
least 300 ft3 of merchantable wood is removed. Under this scenario, treatment 
of 0.5 million acres/year would generate 14.6 million oven-dry tons of biomass 
per year or about 29% of the current level of roundwood removals for the 
selected states.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>&nbsp;This report provides documentation 
and user information for FPL-PELPS, a personal computer price endogenous linear 
programming system for economic modeling. Originally developed to model the 
North American pulp and paper industry, FPL-PELPS follows its predecessors in 
allowing the modeling of any appropriate sector to predict consumption, 
production and capacity by technology, and trade within or among several 
regions or countries. The theoretical structure is that of spatial equilibrium 
modeling under competitive market assumptions. This report contains a 
mathematical description of the system, including its extensions from previous 
versions, and a detailed user's guide with an application of FPL-PELPS.<br>

<b>Abstract:
</b>&nbsp;X-ray diffraction techniques have the potential to decrease the time 
required to determine microfibril angles dramatically. In this paper, we 
discuss the latest version of a curve-fitting toll that permits us to reduce 
the time required to evaluate MFA X-ray diffraction patterns. Further, because 
this tool reflects the underlying physics more accurately than existing tools, 
we expect it to yield more accurate estimates of MFA.<br>

<br><b>Abstract:</b>&nbsp;It has been argued that repetitive member allowable 
property adjustments should be larger for high-variability material than for 
low-variability material. We report analytic calculations and simulations that 
suggest that the order of such adjustments should be reversed. That is, given 
the manner in which allowable properties are currently calculated, as the 
coefficient of variation of the strength distribution of individual elements 
increases, the upward repetitive member adjustments (if any) of assemblies 
constructed from these elements should decrease.<br>

Abstract:</b>&nbsp;About 160 fewer softwood sawmills are operating in the 
United States and Canada than were 8 years ago. Nevertheless, the combined 
capacity of the remaining mills has increased by 16%, to over 173 million cubic 
meters. Of the approximately 1,140 mills, about 470 characterize their output 
as dimension lumber, accounting for 67% of capacity; 136 list studs as their 
primary output, representing 16% of the industry's volume; and 139 are 
primarily board mills, making up a little over 5%. The others make a variety of 
specialty products. In this report, the location and relative size of sawmills 
by State and Province are described in maps and tables. The data show that 
growth in capacity over the past 8 years has exceeded growth in demand, leaving 
the industry with excess capacity of at least 3%. This has contributed to 
volatile pricing and narrow profit margins within the past 3 years, a condition 
aggravated by the dispute over Canadian lumber imports.<br>

<br><b>Abstract:</b>&nbsp;The softwood lumber industry in the United States and 
Canada consists of about 1,067 sawmills. In 2005 these sawmills had a combined 
capacity of 189 million m3 (80 &times; 109 bf). In 2004, they employed about 
99,000 people and produced 172 million m3 (nominal) (73.0 &times; 109 bf) of 
lumber. In the process, they consumed about 280 million m3 (9.9 &times; 109 
ft3) of timber. Employee productivity was near 2,125 m3 (900,000 bf) per worker 
per year for dimension and stud mills but about half that for board, timber, 
and specialty mills. Average saw log size varied from 42 cm (16.6 in.) in 
British Columbia to 16 cm (6.2 in.) in the boreal region of eastern Canada. 
Average lumber recovery factors varied from 267 bf/m3 (7.55 bf/ft3) for timber 
mills to 236 bf/m3 (6.6 bf/ft3) for specialty mills. The average for dimension 
mills was 266 bf/m3 (7.5 bf/ft3). Strong underlying demand for housing, 
supported by demographic growth among young adults and generational low 
interest rates, are strong positives for the industry's prospects. Low interest 
rates, however, are threatened by rising inflation, the measurement of which 
depends on whether new home prices are included or not.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>&nbsp;The number of larger, permanent softwood lumber mills in 
the United States and Canada has shrunk from 1,311 in 1995 to 990 as of June 
2007. These mills had a combined capacity of 190.2 million m3 (80.6 &times; 109 
board feet), slightly down from the 2005 value. In 2006, they produced 171 
million (nominal) m3 (72.3 &times; 109 board feet) of lumber, and in the 
process, generated approximately 0.56 oven-dried metric tons of chips and 0.23 
tons of saw-dust and shavings for every 2.36 m3 (1,000 board feet) of lumber 
produced. Of the chips, 95% were used for pulp and the contribution of this 
product stream to sawmill economics was approximately $2.1 billion (109) U.S. 
dollars. Of the sawdust and shavings, 59% were used for boards, 25% for fuel, 
7% for animal bedding, 4% for pellets, and about 5% were unused or unaccounted 
for. Employment dropped to about 93,000 people, down from 99,000 in 2005 and 
115,000 in 1995. Economic prospects for the industry are clouded by 
overcapacity because of weakness in demand caused by a cyclical downturn in 
housing. Longer term influences include the ongoing mountain pine beetle 
(Dendroctonus ponderosae) epidemic in British Columbia that threatens to cut 
timber supplies over the next 5 to 10 years and the 2006 Softwood Lumber 
Agreement affecting the terms under which lumber is imported from Canada into 
the United States.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>&nbsp;This study compares prices from 
various timber market reports and an estimate of timber value derived from 
product-selling prices and manufacturing costs. In the South, two primary 
sources of timber price information are Forest2Market (F2M) and Timber 
Mart-South (TMS). Comparisons showed that F2M prices are generally higher than 
TMS prices for both stumpage and delivered timber. Residual value (RV) 
estimates tended to vary from these at any given time. Over 5 years, however, 
the negative and positive deviations largely offset each other, resulting in 
roughly the same average price levels, at least compared with TMS. The RV 
estimates also tended to lead the direction of reported prices and were useful 
as leading indicators of reported market price directions. Comparison of 
various price reports from public and private agencies in the West showed that 
Forest Service prices were substantially lower than those recorded by other 
agencies and RV calculations. The discounts appear to reflect lower quality 
offerings and more restrictive harvest regulations that increase harvest costs. 
This report proposes a method of pricing timber based on RV calculations as one 
means to reduce the variability in lumber sawmilling profits.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>&nbsp;From a starting universe of 
approximately 1,300 Canadian and American sawmills, 149 were permanently closed 
between 1996 and 2003. This figure does not include small portable or part-time 
operations. These mills represented 17.6 million m3 of capacity, nearly 12% of 
the 1995 industry total. On the other hand, 25 new mills brought on-line have 
offset 4.9 million m3 of lost production potential. Further, upgrades to 
existing sawmills have added 31 million m3 of capacity. The region most 
severely impacted by closures was the U.S. West, which accounted for over half 
of all the capacity lost. Other regions fared better, with the U.S. South and 
eastern Canada losing the least, the U.S. North and British Columbia taking 
somewhat higher losses. Overall, however, each major producing region gained 
capacity when all changes are accounted for.<br>

<b>Abstract:
</b>&nbsp;This paper provides an overview of the North American (United States 
and Canada) structural panel industry, which consists of softwood plywood and 
oriented strandboard (OSB). The paper describes the evolution of overall 
capacities, effective capacity utilization, and manufacturing costs. As part of 
that, it describes changes in industry operating parameters such as wood use 
and yield, employee productivity, adhesives usage, and energy consumption. The 
major end-use markets for these commodities and market share trends are 
described as they evolved over time. Trends in foreign trade are also covered. 
Softwood plywood capacity peaked in 1989 at around 24 million m3 (27 billion 
ft2) and has since dropped to 16 million m3 (18 billion ft2). By contrast, OSB 
capacity has grown almost continuously and reached 23 million m3 (26 billion 
ft2) in 2006, on its way to about 26 million (29 billion ft2) by 2008. 
Productivity as measured by output capacity per employee is about four times 
higher in an OSB plant than in a plywood mill. Since its inception, OSB product 
recovery (yield) has also improved by about 15%. These are two major reasons 
why OSB manufacturing costs are about 25% lower than those for plywood. Given 
OSB's higher profitability, most of the investment in the sector has been 
directed into that branch. The cyclical nature of structural panel demand 
combined with the tug and pull between plywood and OSB capacities have led to 
considerable cyclical volatility in prices and profits. Over the past 20 years, 
OSB has largely taken over the sheathing portion of the market for structural 
panels. Overall, the construction of new buildings and their upkeep and 
improvement are the largest market for structural panels in the United States. 
In 2003, about 23.3 million m3 (26.3 billion ft2) of structural panels were 
used for sheathing and exterior siding in these markets. The use of plywood for 
sheathing in walls is now rare, somewhat higher in roofs, and highest in 
flooring. To adapt to the competition, plywood manufacturing has evolved toward 
more industrial uses and higher grades of panels where its appearance and 
properties give it an edge that offsets its higher costs. Based on analysis of 
existing market shares of other materials, it is theoretically possible that 
structural panel consumption could be increased by about 40% over current 
levels. This would have represented an additional 9.5 million m3 (10.7 billion 
ft2) of structural panel consumption in 2003. Imports are an increasing part of 
supply, with Brazil, Chile, and Canada supplying growing amounts of plywood 
while Brazil and Europe augment major import flows of OSB from Canada.<br>

<b>Abstract:
</b>&nbsp;This report presents annual data but is published every 2 years. The 
data present current and historical information on the production, trade, 
consumption, and prices of timber products in the United States. The report 
focuses on national statistics, but includes some data for individual States 
and regions and for Canada. The data were collected from industry trade 
associations and government agencies. They are intended for use by forest land 
managers, forest industries, trade associations, forestry schools, renewable 
resource organizations, individuals in the major timber producing and consuming 
countries of the world, and the general public. A major use of the data is 
tracking industry production and consumption trends over time. One of the major 
shifts occurring in the wood using industry over the last 2 years is that both 
production and consumption of roundwood per capita have been increasing. The 
consumption of products per capita also increased over the last 2 years. 
Because of increased paper recycling and increased processing efficiency, the 
consumption per capita in roundwood equivalent has decreased since about 1987 
from 83 ft3 to 72 ft3 per capita. In the 1960s and 1970s, consumption averaged 
65 ft3 per capita. Per capita consumption in 2004 increased to 71 ft3 per 
capita before increasing further in 2005 to 72 ft3 per capita. Another shift 
occurring during 2005 is increased emphasis on wood energy use, which has shown 
wide fluctuations over the last decade into 2005.<br>

<b>Abstract:</b>&nbsp;The timber resource in the United 
States is changing. Available timber is smaller in diameter and lower in 
quality than in the past; and previously undesirable species are now being 
used. During 1998, approximately 505 million cubic meters of roundwood was 
required to produce the wood and fiber products consumed in the United States. 
This level of consumption, the highest ever reached in the United States, 
resulted in a rapid and sustained increase in the cost of timber and a shift 
from solid-sawn to engineered wood products. Following is a discussion of some 
engineered wood products along with a table showing the types (size and 
species) of timber used to produce these products.<br>
