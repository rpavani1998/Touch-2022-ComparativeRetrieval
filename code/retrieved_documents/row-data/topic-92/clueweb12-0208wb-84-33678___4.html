<h2> Finding the right path </h2> 
<p>A garden path can issue an enticing invitation to backyard visitors, or 
just provide a convenient route for plant maintenance. Whatever its use, a 
well-designed and well-built path will enhance the livability and functionality 
of any home garden, says Steve Rodie, landscape horticulture specialist at the 
University of Nebraska-Lincoln.</p> 
<p>The following slides will help you decide what path materials fit your 
budget and your gardening needs.</p>  Related Links

<h2> Gravel: budget-friendly and functional </h2> 
<p><strong>Pros</strong> Inexpensive; good drainage; low-maintenance; won't 
disrupt plants' roots; can stand up to fairly heavy traffic.<br>
<strong>Cons
</strong> Inorganic, so it doesn't improve soil; without the right border, 
gravel pieces can spill out into garden areas. May need to be weeded 
occasionally.<br>
<strong>Tip</strong> Use small, angular stones instead of 
rounded pebbles. They lock together for a more stable walking surface.</p>

<h2> Turf: comfortable but high-maintenance </h2> 
<p><strong>Pros</strong> Looks great when tidy; the most comfortable walking 
surface.<br>
<strong>Cons</strong> Needs constant maintenance and ample sun and 
space. With poor upkeep or heavy use, can easily be worn into mud.<br>
<strong>
Tip</strong> Make sure it's wide enough for your mower.</p>  Related Links

<h2> Dry-laid pavers: good for heavy use </h2> 
<p><strong>Pros</strong> Looks formal or natural; a good choice for heavy use.
<br> <strong>Cons</strong> More expensive than some options; placing pavers on 
bare soil can cause problems such as poor drainage.<br>
<strong>Tip</strong> 
Construct a solid, well-drained, level base from sand or gravel. Surround your 
pavers with a formal edge to keep them from shifting.</p>  Related Links

<h2> Mortared paths: clean and formal </h2> 
<p><strong>Pros</strong> Provides the cleanest, most formal look. If designed 
correctly, requires minimal maintenance.<br>
<strong>Cons</strong> The most 
expensive path. Midwest weather extremes can make bricks/stones crack and 
split. Not a DIY project for most people.<br>
<strong>Tip</strong> Consider 
materials that visually tie into existing stone or brick in your garden.</p>

<h2> Wood mulch: easy and natural </h2> 
<p><strong>Pros</strong> Easy and inexpensive to lay down; looks natural; 
replenishes the soil. Three solid inches of mulch blocks most weeds.<br>

<strong>Cons</strong> Requires yearly replenishing. Wood chips get kicked off 
the path easily, and the path wears down quickly. Best for low-traffic areas.
<br> <strong>Tip</strong> Instead of bark or wood chips, use shredded mulch, 
which stays in place better.</p>  Related Links

<h2> Stones and mulch: a good blend </h2> 
<p><strong>Pros</strong> A good solution for a path that gets moderate use.<br>
<strong>Cons</strong> Mulch needs to be replenished each year; pavers may shift 
over time.<br>
<strong>Tip</strong> Use stones that are large, and set them at 
a distance that is comfortable to walk along.</p>  Related Links

<h2> More ideas for your garden path </h2> 
<p><strong>Soften stones' edges</strong> Ground-hugging plants such as thyme 
and fescue<em>(left)</em> add visual interest between stones. Lavender next to 
the path also softens the edge of the walkway.</p> 
<p><strong>Curve it</strong> Curving paths are more pleasing to the eye more 
than straight ones. They can also help narrow areas feel larger.</p>  Related

<h2> Personalize your path </h2> 
<p><strong>Add personal touches</strong> Handmade stepping-stones add beauty 
and color to your garden path. Mosaic patterns may be more slippery than rough 
stone, though, especially when wet.</p>
