<h2>Mulch, Tree Bark &amp; Rubber Mulch </h2> <br>

<p><strong>WESTERN RED CEDAR</strong><br>

golden/reddish color. Cedar has a pleasant smell and is a natural insect 
repellent.</p> 
<p><strong>WASHINGTON CEDAR (Gorilla Hair)</strong><br>

hair). This product mats down to create a blanket that is more wind resistant 
than most other mulches. Has a pleasant smell and is a natural insect repellent.
</p>

 Harvest 
mulch is made from recycled construction material such as pallets, 2x4&rsquo;s, 
ECT. And is dyed with a non-toxic dye. Because it is dyed, the color will last 
longer than that of natural mulches.</p>

material is a deep reddish/brown color. This product mats down to create a 
blanket that is very wind tolerant and attractive.</p>

vegetable gardens. With it&rsquo;s fine texture it retains soil moisture,
