<h2>Seven Steps To A Super Staff</h2>  Date Published:&nbsp;  August, 2004  
Original Author:&nbsp;  Tom Smith &amp; Tom Pfeifer  Spring Grove Cemetery 
&amp; Arboretum, Cincinnati, Ohio  Original Publication:&nbsp;  ICFM Magazine, 
August-September 2004 
<p><em>Figuring out which mower or backhoe to buy may be tough, but it's 
nothing compared to deciding who to hire to operate the mower or backhoe.<br>
 
Whether you've got a grounds staff so large that some people do nothing but run 
a string trimmer or a staff so small that the backhoe operator also sits down 
with families to design monuments, you can't afford to take hiring lightly.</em>
</p> 
<p>WHAT: We've done a 180-degree turn on the whole subject of hiring. Thirty 
years ago, our process was something like: &quot;Run down the street, and if 
you see a warm body moving, try to get them to take the job.&quot; Today, we're 
like the Marines: We're always looking for a few good people. It doesn't matter 
what time of year it is, we're always looking. We want the best of the best. We 
might interview 15 people to fill two jobs.</p> 
<p>WHY: To carry through what you're trying to do at your cemetery you need 
the right people. It doesn't make a bit of difference how much good equipment 
you buy, you've got to have the right people with the right attitude and the 
right standards to operate that equipment the way you want it to be operated 
and to do the job in a way that will keep your customers happy.</p> 
<p>If you don't start out with great people, even training becomes so 
difficult&mdash;never mind the problems the person may cause down the line. 
It's crucial you go through an exhaustive search to get the right people.</p> 
<p>HOW: Most of the people we hire full-time start out as seasonal workers. 
This gives us a chance to examine their overall work habits and work ethic. The 
possible downside is that when you're hiring seasonal workers, you may go in 
with the mind set that you just need good technicians for specific jobs, and 
not think down the road to the possibility that some of these people may become 
full-time. That's one reason we've decided to ratchet up the standards for 
seasonal workers. We're trying to remind ourselves, 'These people could be 
full-time in a year.&quot;</p> 
<p>Most of the people who move from part-time to full-time staff do so at the 
recommendation of a supervisor. A person who does a good job of mowing the 
grass and string trimming and basically keeping the grounds looking good 40 
hours a week is not necessarily qualified to move up to the backhoe level and 
start operating a $70,000 piece of equipment and maneuvering it around our 
expensive monuments and landscaping. And of course the supervisory level 
requires different skills.</p> 
<p>We also realize that not everyone who comes to work at Spring Grove, 
whether part-time or full-time, will be here in five or 10 years. Some people 
use the training they get by working here to qualify for another job, maybe to 
run their own landscaping business. There's nothing wrong with that.</p> 
<p>We might post a job opening internally and advertise it outside as well. We 
generally advertise in the suburban community press, rather than in the larger 
paper. This helps us target specific areas at less cost. For seasonal or 
part-time help, we advertise at the colleges as well.</p> 
<p>1. Don't automatically give an applicant extra credit for previous cemetery 
experience. In certain positions we might want someone with experience, but for 
the most part, just because a person has worked at another cemetery for several 
years doesn't mean we'll be hiring that person. We're willing to train. In 
fact, Spring Grove has its own way of doing things, and if a person worked at 
another cemetery some of the training may involve undoing the training they got 
there. You want your employees working to your standards, not saying to 
themselves, &quot;Well, that's the way we did it at Soandso Cemetery&mdash;that 
should be good enough.&quot;</p> 
<p>2. Set up a check list for qualifications that must be met. We have a fact 
sheet they have to fill out: Can you lift 40 pounds? Do you have a valid 
driver's license? We like applicants to have a high school diploma or GED, 
since many positions, such as backhoe operator or marker technician, require a 
good ability to read and write.</p> 
<p>3. Consider an applicant's job history. Maybe you don't want someone who's 
had 10 jobs in 20 years. At Spring Grove, we want someone who is likely to have 
some longevity.</p> 
<p>4. Interview to discover work ethic and attitude. Attitude is crucial, yet 
this is something no one studied in school. Who ever signed up for Attitude 
101? So this is something you'll have to try to discover through the interview 
process. Here's how:</p> 
<p>&bull; Use open-ended questions, not questions that elicit a &quot;yes or 
no&quot; response. Ask what they liked best about their previous job, what they 
liked least, how they interacted with people. Ask them to tell you their best 
success story as far as helping a customer. Things like that will give you an 
idea of whether they're a fit for the cemetery business or not. Another good 
question: ''Tell me about your last boss. Describe how he or she handled your 
work relationship.&quot; If you ask an applicant that and the jugular vein on 
the neck starts to throb, that can tell you a lot right there!</p> 
<p>The bottom line is, ask a lot of questions and then sit back and listen and 
observe. Make mental notes about what you're hearing and it shouldn't be 
difficult to determine whether that person will be coming back for Interview 
Round Two.</p> 
<p>&bull; Include several people in the interview process. We can't stress 
enough how important it is to have more than one interview, and to involve the 
employees the new person will be working with. We also have at least two people 
conduct each interview. You want to get multiple views on whether the person is 
a good fit for your company and the position.</p> 
<p>We do two to three interviews for a new hire (someone who hasn't worked for 
us part-time). Maybe two supervisors or a manager and a supervisor will conduct 
one.</p> 
<p>And before someone is hired, there has to be an interview involving the 
people he or she would be working with. This is good for the interview process; 
it will result in different questions and insights. It's amazing what you'll 
learn during the debriefing process after you've talked to an applicant, the 
things that some people will have noticed that others didn't.</p> 
<p>It's also good for your employees to get a feel for whether they want to 
work with this person. Even if you only have two employees, if the two don't 
get along, you're going to spend all your time dealing with their conflicts.</p>
<p>Doing this also creates &quot;buy-in&quot; and team camaraderie. Years ago, 
when employees were told on Friday afternoon that someone new would be starting 
on Monday, it was &quot;the managers decided,&quot; &quot;they hired 
someone.&quot; And the employees would think, &quot;I wonder who the heck 
they're bringing in?&quot; Now, when the new person starts, they're welcomed to 
the team by some of the people who were part of the process.</p> 
<p>&bull; During the interview process, let applicants know what your company 
has to offer the right person besides money. Good employees will be interested 
in more than the starting pay. One of the things we learned as we've refined 
this whole process is that money isn't the only thing that motivates people.</p>
<p>When companies are having trouble filling positions, the automatic response 
is &quot;you've got to pay more, you've got to pay more.&quot; But back when we 
were chasing after people to work here, we were already paying well&mdash;very 
well&mdash;and we're convinced that's not an issue, at least not here. You do 
have to be in the ballpark as far as pay, certainly, but people want more out 
of a job than money. What else can you offer? Communication and recognition.</p>
<p>Communication: People want to have a feeling that they are part of things, 
that what they do matters. An applicant will want to know, ''Can I be a part of 
what's going on here, or is working here going to be a matter of 'Do what 
you're told, keep your mouth shut and keep on mowing'? Am I going to be kept 
informed about what's going on?&quot;</p> 
<p>At Spring Grove, it doesn't matter if you're a vice president or a student 
who's a part-time string trimmer, you're going to know what the company's 
vision is and you're going to know that we're all working together as a team. 
People like that. They like feeling that they're &quot;in&quot; on things, that 
they're being kept informed no matter what their job is.</p> 
<p>In too many companies, the attitude is, &quot;Well, that's something the 
officers will decide. We don't tell the line people about that&quot; But those 
line people are the people who are getting the job done! They're the ones who 
need to know where the company's going and what the vision for the company is.
</p> 
<p>Recognition: We have a sign that says, ''People work for money, but they 
excel for recognition.&quot; We don't do enough of it in the American 
workplace. Every way and every chance you get, recognize people. Find people 
doing good things and let them know right then and there. Have all kind, of 
recognition programs.</p> 
<p>Of course, doing these things will help you keep people once you've hired 
them. We've had people tell us, &quot;Wow, what a great company to work for. 
Nobody I worked for ever asked my opinion before. Nobody had an appreciation 
event.&quot;</p> 
<p>5. Consider doing some testing. We're still developing this, but we've had 
great success with testing that determines personality styles. We had used it 
for years in hiring sales people before we started using it on the operations 
side.</p> 
<p>We definitely do testing now when we're advertising for our supervisory 
jobs, using a test designed for the purpose. It's helped us make decisions we 
would not have made if we'd just gone with our gut feelings.</p> 
<p>The testing organization we dealt with designed a test that tells us how 
people would handle a hypothetical situation if they were supervisors. The 
first time we did it, the test results surprised us at first, but when we read 
over them, we could see that they were accurate, and we've never looked back.
</p> 
<p>6. After you select a candidate, do a pre-employment check. We pay a third 
party to do it, and it costs less than $50 per check. Most of the 
time&mdash;maybe 70 percent of the time&mdash;it comes back exactly as you 
expected, with everything the applicant told you checking out. But then there 
are the times it doesn't.</p> 
<p>Sometimes it's bizarre what you find out&mdash;sometimes people just lie. 
The person said he had a valid driver's license but doesn't. We've had serious 
problems show up&mdash;gun law violations, robberies. It might take a week 
longer to get the new person on the job (assuming everything checks out), but 
the extra time and expense are definitely worth it. Think what it could cost 
you in the long run if you hire some scam artist.</p> 
<p>7. Require drug screening. No one starts to work here without taking that 
final step. And again, people know they'll have to pass a drug test to work 
here and yet sometimes you get the results and it's &quot;oops.&quot;</p> 
<p>No matter what you do, of course, you won't be immune to some bad hiring 
decisions, but if you take these steps you should have plenty of successes.</p>

<h2>How a Forgotten Ravine Was Turned Into a Memorial Park's Showpiece</h2>  
Date Published:&nbsp;  July, 2004  Original Author:&nbsp;  Susan Loving  
Managing Editor, ICCFA Magazine, Sterling, Virginia  Original Publication:&nbsp;
 ICFM Magazine, July 2004 
<p><em>Cemeteries add mausoleums for a variety of reasons, but when they face 
running out of room for interments, making more efficient use of their 
remaining land tends to top the list. Hillside Memorial Park and Mortuary added 
20 years' of interment space with its Garden of the Matriarchs project, but it 
involved doing a lot of planning, making many appearances before city officials 
and dealing with neighbors who didn't want their view of the cemetery ruined!
</em></p> 
<p>As the end of the 20th century neared, Hillside Memorial Park and Mortuary 
appeared to be approaching the end of its active life. COO Barry Berlin 
calculated the Culver City, California, property had five to seven and a half 
years of interment or entombment space left, much of it not prime property. And 
families coming to Hillside were accustomed to being able to choose the best. 
The memorial park's list of &quot;distinguished residents&quot; includes people 
who made their mark in Hollywood, business, education and athletics.</p> 
<p>&quot;When you get down near the end of the cemetery's life,&quot; said 
Berlin, &quot;a lot of what you have left is odds and ends. Family estates or 
single spaces become scarce or unavailable.&quot;</p> 
<p>There was a ravine behind the maintenance area that was overgrown and 
forgotten. Forty years ago, Hillside's owners were told the metropolitan water 
district had an easement on it that made it unusable for interments. But the 
only other contiguous parcel of land the memorial park owned, a former 
supermarket site, was tied up in a long-term lease. The cemetery would run out 
of space before the land was available, much less made usable, and no other 
contiguous land was available for sale.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>So, Berlin took another look at the 2.25- acre ravine area, hidden and 
separated from the rest of the park by the maintenance building and a garden 
crypt complex as well as its topography. He found that yes, there was a 
drainage easement on the land, but it was held by Culver City, not the Los 
Angeles County Department of Water and Power, and was not as extensive as had 
been believed. &quot;All of a sudden,&quot; Berlin said, &quot;we found 
ourselves two and a quarter acres of usable land.&quot;</p> 
<p>In 1999, the first plans were drawn up for the project, which was completed 
in 2004. Berlin talked to ICFM about coming up with a plan that would make the 
neighbors and city happy while making the most out of Hillside's 
&quot;found&quot; land.</p> 
<p>What did you have to do to satisfy the city? <br>
 Culver City said we 
could build on the land if our civil engineers could design a drain system to 
allow drainage through the park to continue. We had to resection the drains in 
the park so the water would flow under the park. Under the mausoleum, there is 
a spillway containing 1,500 cubic yards of solid concrete. In the unlikely 
event the drains overflow, the water will simply go under the building and out.
</p> 
<p>The whole approval process took three and a half years. We had to go 
through the Planning Department, which asked for numerous changes, and then of 
course we had some contentious public hearings&mdash;the neighbors were 
concerned that the new building would block their beautiful view of Hillside's 
park-like setting&mdash;and the whole thing had to go before the Culver City 
Council.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>The neighbors didn't want their view of the cemetery blocked?? <br>
 
Remember, we've been here since 1941, before any of the residences nearby were 
built. Their view, when they moved in, was of a park, since this is a memorial 
park without upright monuments. So they were afraid the building would be ugly, 
or would block their view.</p> 
<p>Obviously in the end Culver City approved the project. <br>
 The City 
Council voted unanimously to allow us to build, but with 52 conditions. We had 
to do a lot of things that really had nothing to do with the project, but the 
city saw us as a vehicle for getting all kinds of things done.</p> 
<p>We had to build bus shelters and benches. We had to beautify the entire 
exterior of the park, change some of the bushes and trees along Green Valley 
Circle, Doverwood Drive and Centinela Avenue, which is on the opposite end of 
the memorial park from where the mausoleum was being built. They had us 
completely change the irrigation system, build retaining walls, make 
handicapped-accessible sidewalks, smooth out slopes and put in curbing. 
Fifty-two conditions of approval, let me tell you, is a lot of conditions! But 
all the work enhanced the area.</p> 
<p>Did you have a number in mind for how many interment spaces you wanted to 
get out of this property?<br>
 We told the architects, Mekus Studios, we wanted 
to maximize every single inch of space, but we knew that we needed to include 
ground space as well as wall crypts. In the Jewish religion, most people still 
prefer ground burial, particularly in the case of Orthodox Jews. While we are 
owned by a Reform temple, we serve Orthodox, Conservative and Reform families 
as well as unaffiliated members of the community.</p> 
<p>We also had to work with the topography. This was a very difficult 
engineering project, because the land was a disaster, in terms of its 
topography. It had deep valleys, high hills and wild trees. We couldn't just go 
in there with a bulldozer and level it out&mdash;the city would have had a 
hemorrhage, to say the least. And we had to design the building to be as 
unobtrusive as possible as far as the neighbors were concerned.</p> 
<p>We tore down the maintenance building on the edge of the &quot;found&quot; 
land after we built a new one elsewhere, in a wooded area, but we needed to 
coordinate the new mausoleum with the existing garden crypt complex, Sunland 
Gardens.<br>
 Our original plan was to have a building of one height, within 
the city's height<br>
 restriction, but that turned out to be too massive. It 
was back to the drawing board, and what emerged was a three-tiered mausoleum 
with gardens atop the first two levels and a skylight on the third level, as 
well as lawn crypts divided into three gardens.</p> 
<p>The gardens are beautiful and the neighbors love it. They've called us, 
they've come over to walk through the gardens and tell us that they are very, 
very pleased. The ones who were our antagonists at one time have admitted that 
it's beautiful and very different from what they had envisioned.</p> 
<p>We started construction in 2002 and Court of the Matriarchs mausoleum and 
Garden of the Matriarchs lawn crypts were dedicated in January of this year.</p>
<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>How much space did you end up with?<br>
 We added 5,356 crypts, including 
2,687 double-depth crypts. In the mausoleum, we have 2,854 casket spaces. We 
have five family rooms with a capacity of 12 to 18 caskets. All five have been 
sold, were sold while the building was still under construction. We couldn't 
include more because that would have decreased total capacity too much.</p> 
<p>We estimate this project gives us an additional 15 to 20 years of interment 
or entombment space. It also gives us a nice array of different types of 
inventory so no matter what a family is looking for; we have something to show 
them.</p> 
<p>When did you start selling? <br>
 We started preconstruction sales in 2002, 
using artist's renderings, and we've done very well. The early sales helped pay 
for the project.</p> 
<p>What sort of marketing have you done?<br>
 A massive amount. We've 
contacted all the temples and other Jewish organizations. We've worked out 
arrangements so that if they, or a congregant, purchase property, we will make 
a donation to the synagogue. We've sent direct mail to the client lists our 
sales counselors have. We've advertised extensively in the Jewish weekly 
newspaper in Los Angeles, both with regular ads and inserts.</p> 
<p>We've done everything we could to get the word out to the Jewish population 
of Los Angeles, which is extensive, that we have something new and unique, and 
it seems to have worked.</p> 
<p>What will you do with the land now under lease when it becomes available? 
<br> Our master plan shows us tearing down the administration building and 
mortuary, replacing them with new buildings on that property, which is at the 
intersection of Green Valley Circle and Centinela Avenue, which is where we'll 
move the main entrance.<br>
 We'll keep the chapel now located by the current 
mortuary, and include a chapel with the new mortuary. That will give us the 
ability to handle two services at the same time.</p> 
<p>The administration building and mortuary take up about 9,000 square feet, 
so moving them will free up some land, which we'll use for mausoleum space. 
Since we'll have a new main entrance, we can close some of the current roadway 
and develop it, as well.</p> 
<p>I won't be here to do all this, but in the cemetery business you have to 
think long term.</p>  Code:&nbsp;  A1472

<h2>Tractors and Backhoes and Mowers, Oh My!</h2>  Date Published:&nbsp;  
March, 2004  Original Author:&nbsp;  Tom Smith &amp; Tom Pfeifer  Spring Grove 
Cemetery &amp; Arboretum, Cincinnati, Ohio  Original Publication:&nbsp;  ICFM 
Magazine, March-April 2004 
<p><em>Deciding what equipment to buy for your cemetery or memorial park is a 
crucial grounds maintenance decision. There's nothing worse than buying an 
expensive piece of equipment that ends up sitting in the corner of your garage 
because it can't handle the job.</em></p> 
<p>WHAT: When selecting grounds maintenance equipment at Spring Grove, we 
don't buy anything until the people who will be using it have tried it out.</p> 
<p>WHY: The wrong decisions can cost you money in repair and replacement costs 
and increase the cost of completing a task. If equipment problems mean the 
grounds don't look their best and jobs aren't being handled quickly, customer 
satisfaction and sales will be affected. And having machinery that's 
cumbersome, prone to breakdown or unsafe in some way will hurt employee 
morale&mdash;if not the employees themselves.</p> 
<p>HOW: Reading a press release or checking a company's Web site can give you 
the basic specs, but you can't buy this type of &ldquo;hands on,&rdquo; 
hard-working equipment based on that type of research alone.</p> 
<p>&bull; Deal with high-quality vendors, people who listen to you, the 
customer. Some of the progressive companies in this business are so 
customer-oriented they invite customers such as Spring Grove to take part in 
sort of a focus group where we suggest areas for improvement and indicate what 
our greatest challenges are.</p> 
<p>These aren't manufacturers saying, ''We've got the best engineers in the 
world, we know how to do everything.&quot; Instead, they're asking the people 
who actually use the equipment under all kinds of different conditions what 
their challenges are. They're asking customers, ''What can we do better? How 
can we improve this product? Where are the breaks occurring in this piece of 
equipment? Where do you see that the metal may be fatiguing? Where can we beef 
this thing up? How can we improve the safety? Are you able to use this easily 
on 15 degree grades?&quot;</p> 
<p>We rotate selection of the employees who get to take part in these groups, 
since it's a &quot;feel good&quot; reward for our people.</p> 
<p>Even if your cemetery can't participate in this type of research, you can 
get an idea of the quality of the company by asking them whether they do this 
type of thing and by noticing how their salespeople respond if you make 
suggestions. Ask the company what kind of input they get from cemeteries. It's 
just part of doing business in America 2004: How can you improve whatever 
you're doing to meet&mdash;and exceed&mdash;the customers' needs and 
expectations?</p> 
<p>&bull; Be open-minded. We're willing to try anything new that comes down 
the pike. Some cemeteries try to look for a way to beat up on anything new, 
whether it's a new piece of equipment or a new way to memorialize. But we love 
to share information at meetings about new things.</p> 
<p>&bull; Listen to the sales pitch and ask questions. When you decide to have 
the sales rep bring in a demonstration model, make sure you spend time with him 
or her&mdash;don't just let them drop off the machine and leave. We make sure 
they train us in using it, tell us what's new, what's unusual about the piece 
of equipment, why the rep feels it would be a valuable addition to our fleet.
</p> 
<p>&bull; Evaluate, evaluate, evaluate. Make sure there's plenty of time to 
try out the equipment. Don't let the sales rep say, &quot;You can have it this 
afternoon, but I need to pick it up in the morning and take it to the next 
place.&quot; What we want to do is really put the piece of equipment into use 
for several weeks&mdash;certainly not for a couple of days or a couple of hours.
</p> 
<p>We want several different people to try it out, we want to use it under 
different conditions&mdash;different temperatures, different growth 
applications (spring grass vs. summer grass). Then get all the people who have 
tried out the equipment together and talk about the pros and cons.</p> 
<p>We don't buy anything unless we've had a good chance to try it out. Our 
other cemetery, Oak Hill, is experimenting with a smaller backhoe. We have an 
old one that needs to be replaced and we're trying to decide if we need one the 
same size or should we buy a smaller one that can do other things besides dig 
graves.</p> 
<p>If a company won't let you keep a piece of equipment for a long time or if 
you don't have the time and personnel to test out equipment, there are a couple 
of things you can do. This is where networking comes in handy. You can call 
someone at one of the larger operations in your area and ask if they have any 
experience with that piece of equipment.</p> 
<p>You can also ask the sales rep where the equipment is available as a 
rental. A lot of times, even if they haven't thought to make those rental 
arrangements, you can work something out. Simply explain that you don't feel 
comfortable buying the equipment based on trying it out for a couple of hours 
and would like to work out an agreement for, say, a one-month rental. We 
handled a stump grinder evaluation that way one time.</p> 
<p>The evaluation process, including renting a piece of equipment, also can 
help you if you're trying to decide whether a particular process is something 
you want to handle internally or is something you'd rather outsource.</p> 
<p>&bull; Try more than one product. We once bought a tamper that we thought 
was going to do the job fine. We had tried it out, but later, after we tried 
some other ones, we realized we could get one with the same amount of 
compaction capability that weighs about 30 pounds less. We bought the lighter 
one, too, and now when it's down for repairs it's like pulling teeth to get 
someone to use that heavier one.</p> 
<p>&bull; Make sure the people who will actually be operating the equipment on 
a daily business try it out. If you've done your job as a manager, the people 
actually doing the work with the machinery know what the cemetery's 
expectations are, they know what they have to get done in a given amount of 
time. Handling things this way also improves morale and cuts down on complaints 
from employees. You don't want to hear, &quot;They got that for me. I didn't 
want it. They made me use it.&quot; You want to get rid of the &quot;they&quot; 
complaints and get everyone on the &quot;we&quot; team.</p>  Code:&nbsp;  A1459

<h2>Cemetery Architecture and Planning for Profit and Identity</h2>  Date 
Published:&nbsp;  March, 2004  Original Author:&nbsp;  William Toson  The 
Tribute Companies, Hartland, Wisconsin  Original Publication:&nbsp;  ICFM 
Magazine, March-April 2004 
<p><em>When your cemetery undertakes a project, whether it's building a 
mausoleum or developing a new section, you want to ensure that it will make a 
profit and benefit the cemetery's image in the community.<br>
 Creative design 
and planning can do just that.</em></p> 
<p>Planning cemetery developments is far from a one-size-fits-all proposition. 
In addition to the physical characteristics that affect what can be done at a 
specific site, many other factors come into play.</p> 
<p>Each cemetery has its own traditions, priorities, client base, financial 
status, ownership and mission, and all of these factors must be taken into 
account, as well, for a project to be a success. How do you measure success? A 
successful project must measure up in the following ways:<br>
 &bull; Function: 
It must meet the cemetery's needs as intended.<br>
 &bull; Beauty: It should 
add to the cemetery's image, interest and identity.<br>
 &bull; Return on 
investment: It should generate income.<br>
 &bull; Client satisfaction: The 
result should be considered worth the time and investment the cemetery made in 
the project.</p> 
<p>Money Is Basic <br>
 You should begin each project with the premise that 
your first goal is to make a profit. This generally means that the project has 
to generate a positive cash flow. One of your first decisions will be about 
pre-construction sales.</p> 
<p>Some states require sales to be delayed until after a new development is 
completed, but even where this is not the case, many cemeteries prefer to take 
this approach. Reasons for not selling on a pre-construction basis include:</p> 
<p>&bull; Not wanting to get involved with temporary entombments. <br>
 &bull; 
Wanting to avoid trusting of construction funds.<br>
 &bull; Wanting families 
to see exactly what they are getting before they buy.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>If you choose this approach, you must take that into account in your 
financial planning. The money you put into the building, added to the income 
you will not be earning on preconstruction sales, will affect its cost. 
Foregoing pre-construction sales will add as much as 10 percent to the cost of 
your project.</p> 
<p>The &quot;If You Build It They Will Come&quot; approach may work in the 
movies, but in the real world, most cemeteries and funeral homes cannot afford 
it. Even if your developer offers extended financing, if cash outflow exceeds 
cash inflow, you have added cost to the project. This is referred to as the 
&quot;opportunity cost&quot; of capital.</p> 
<p>You must also size your project properly to ensure financial success. If 
your project is too large, it will require too much of a cash outlay and/or 
will take too long to sell, thereby tying up too much capital.</p> 
<p>On the other hand, if you make your project too small, you make the unit 
cost of development so high that you will be unable to generate a profit.</p> 
<p>If you are unsure about the market for your project, you may want to 
conduct (or commission) a study to evaluate market potential and probable 
consumer response, to estimate the rate of sales and to gain an understanding 
of price sensitivity.</p> 
<p>What development method generates the best financial results? One that 
generates a positive cash flow. To accomplish this, the project must do the 
following:</p> 
<p>&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Be saleable by meeting the needs and desires of 
your clients.<br>
 &bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Compliment either the image you 
have already established for your property or the new image you wish to create.
<br> &bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Provide value&mdash;the perceived quality must 
exceed the price.</p> 
<p>Case Studies <br>
 The following projects illustrate how good planning and 
design can enhance the image of a cemetery and help ensure its long term 
financial health.</p> 
<p>Oak Grove Cemetery <br>
 This is a well-run, conservatively operated 
cemetery in La Crosse, Wisconsin. In the 1980s, the cemetery's board decided it 
needed to address the following issues:</p> 
<p>&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lack of inventory: The cemetery was fully 
developed and appeared to lack room for expansion.<br>
 
&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Public perception: People believed all the cemetery's 
facilities were old and that the cemetery was full.<br>
 
&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Buildings in need of work: The maintenance building 
was in disrepair and the office facility was inadequate.<br>
 
&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The board had the money for improvements and also had 
a vision of Oak Grove's role in the community The plan developed for Oak Grove 
took the following approach:<br>
 &bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Auditing assets: 
Usable grave spaces and unplatted lands were inventoried.<br>
 
&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Analyzing strengths and weaknesses, including land, 
buildings, people and reputation.<br>
 &bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Evaluating the 
integrity of buildings, both structurally and operationally.<br>
 
&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Creating a master plan showing potential future 
development, establishing phases of development and estimating the cost of each 
phase.<br>
 &bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Arriving at a consensus for action: The 
board members agreed on a list of short- and long-term goals.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Through this process, a significant number of potential new grave spaces 
were obtained by removing trees and bush beds and closing a few roads. This 
effort added 20 years of useful life&mdash;additional sales&mdash;to the 
cemetery.</p> 
<p>Establishing that the cemetery did have salable inventory provided the 
financial basis for investing in improvements.</p> 
<p>Changing the cemetery's image of being outdated was a top priority. The 
board decided the first step was to replace the office and maintenance 
buildings. The design incorporated an office, board room, crematorium and 
maintenance and storage facility, and looking to the future, included a phased 
development of a garden mausoleum and columbarium.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>The first phase of the project was completed in 1988, and for the next 
several years, the cemetery conducted a marketing campaign designed to let 
people know they were still in business.</p> 
<p>In 1996, the first phase of the mausoleum/columbarium development was 
completed, with memorialization for cremation given high priority through 
inclusion of niches of various configurations. The result? Strong sales and 
revitalization of a 100-year old cemetery.</p> 
<p>Prairie Home Cemetery <br>
 The governing commission of this municipal 
cemetery in Waukesha, Wisconsin, decided its main objective was to operate 
independent of taxpayer money. To accomplish this, commission members elected 
to establish a marketing program and add a complete line of products and 
services to sell.</p> 
<p>The cemetery had an excellent reputation and identity. Over the years, it 
had constructed a number of smaller garden mausoleum buildings. The challenge 
was to enhance the cemetery's image by offering a unique product that 
complimented existing structures.</p> 
<p>Siting the new development at the front of the cemetery, and next to the 
main entrance, was considered important. A radius design consisting of three 
new buildings encircling a central courtyard serves as a buffer to the road 
located on the cemetery perimeter. A fourth building, lower in height, is 
located on the inside perimeter to serve as a focal point with a central 
waterfall. Semiprivate sanctuary areas were integrated throughout the 
development to provide quiet, intimate spaces.</p> 
<p>A large bell tower anchors the entire development. To provide a source of 
revenue, the tower contains a private room with couch crypts and niche spaces. 
While it was being built, one patron was so impressed that he gave the cemetery 
a generous gift, and the tower was named after him.<br>
</p> 
<p>Sunset Memorial Park <br>
 Sunset, in North Olmsted, Ohio, is a large, 
progressive cemetery blessed with forward-thinking and creative owners. The 
cemetery has completed many projects, but two in particular illustrate how to 
enhance the value and image of a property.</p> 
<p>First, Sunset wanted to create a chapel that would ease the burden of loss 
by providing a place for visitation and services as well as banquet facilities, 
all in one location. This facility would allow for a more comfortable and 
acceptable place for lot owners.</p> 
<p>The facility's open, gracious lobby offers visitors a bright and uplifting 
greeting. The three chapel rooms can accommodate a service of almost any size, 
from the intimate &quot;family only&quot; to the largest of gatherings. On the 
lower level, two banquet areas, complete with small kitchens, provide a place 
for families and friends to gather after the service. Families may choose a 
caterer or plan the dinner themselves.</p> 
<p>A second project illustrates an income producing concept most cemeteries 
can use. Sunset had a garden of several acres situated on an uncomfortable 
slope. The section also lacked identity.</p> 
<p>In order to maximize traditional inground burials and use the slope to 
advantage, a retaining wall was constructed in the middle of the section, and 
the terrain was reconfigured to create smaller garden areas. A series of 
columbaria were added along the retaining wall, which became the garden's main 
feature as well as a revenue source.</p> 
<p>***** <br>
 Custom design by experienced cemetery planners and architects 
knowledgeable about the death care profession and sensitive to the client's 
financial goals does not have to cost more than simply buying a building or a 
garden design out of a catalog, and can create a project that will enhance a 
cemetery's image as well as its finances.</p>  Code:&nbsp;  A1456

<h2>Practicing ethical behavior</h2>  Date Published:&nbsp;  August, 2005  
Original Author:&nbsp;  Victoria Hand  Washington Memory Gardens Inc, Homewood, 
IL  Original Publication:&nbsp;  ICFM Magazine, August-September 2005 
<p><em>Treating customers with care, honesty and dignity helps us build 
ethical business practices and also helps us learn what standards to expect 
from ourselves.</em></p> 
<p>As individuals with free will, we must determine for ourselves what ethical 
standards to follow. Therefore, it is possible that others' standards will 
differ from our own.</p> 
<p>This can add to the struggle of deciding what is right and wrong in 
business, especially when something falls in a gray area. Many issues have two 
sides and will never have a black or white answer.</p> 
<p>The basic question you should ask yourself when a problem situation occurs 
in your business is, &quot;How will my decision affect my conscience?&quot;</p> 
<p>If your company discovers a wrongful burial and you correct the problem at 
midnight, without notice to the family, you might find yourself very troubled, 
even haunted by that decision. However, if you fess up to the family, apologize 
and then correct the problem, after it is all over, you are likely to feel good 
about your decision&mdash;and not likely to have nightmares.<br>
 &nbsp;<br>
 
In other words, honesty is the best policy. When you enter into a contract with 
a customer, you must follow through. If you find, after the customer has left, 
that you made a mistake in an agreement, such as putting down an incorrect 
burial location, you must not change the agreement. You must have the customer 
return and execute a corrected agreement.</p> 
<p>If you make a verbal promise to the customer, you must follow through. A 
good example of this might be when you promise a grave will be sodded. Get it 
done! You must also follow through by checking to see that your promise has 
been fulfilled (since you are probably not going to sod that grave yourself). 
Always remember the Golden Rule: Treat others as you want to be treated.</p> 
<p>Most of us know what unethical practices are in business. Stealing is 
unethical. If you remove someone's flowers off their loved one's grave and put 
them on someone else's grave, it's stealing. If you accept payment for services 
and don't render those services, you are stealing.</p> 
<p>Lying is unethical. If you show a picture of a certain type of vault when 
you make a sale and then deliver a different type of vault at the time of need, 
you have lied to the customer.</p> 
<p>Abusing a customer is unethical. In our sensitive business, ethical 
violations can include psychological abuse. Take the example of a headstone 
damage, which can occur during mowing. If a customer comes to you to report 
such damage and you dance around the issue instead of acknowledging and taking 
care of it that could constitute psychological abuse. You must train your 
employees to be truthful so that you can honestly deal with customers.<br>
 It 
is always a good idea to have a mission statement framed and posted in your 
office so customers can see it. For example, your mission statement can promise 
customers that your company will:<br>
 &bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; honor their 
wishes,<br>
 &bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; take care of their loved ones with 
compassion, and<br>
 &bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; deal honestly with all customers. 
</p> 
<p>The 5 areas to cover <br>
 There are five important areas you need to cover 
in business ethics: conduct, administration, confidentiality, competence and 
identification.</p> 
<p>Conduct: Everyone who comes in contact with a customer must always engage 
in ethical behavior. It is wise to have everyone trained in your state's laws 
and to stress the importance of being truthful. If all employees are truthful 
to each consumer about what they are buying and are honest about any mistakes 
made, they will be practicing good, ethical behavior.</p> 
<p>Administration: The people in authority must always practice ethical 
behavior. If you set an example of unethical behavior to your employees, you 
can expect them to learn from it and practice what they have learned.</p> 
<p>Confidentiality: This is of utmost importance when dealing with customers. 
Giving out your mailing list is unethical. Letting someone know the cause of 
death of a decedent is unethical. Some of these practices are also illegal.</p> 
<p>Competency: Being good at what you do leads to good ethical practices. If 
someone who works for you out on the grounds is constantly damaging headstones 
while mowing, that person is incompetent, and so is the manager charged with 
training and supervising that employee.</p> 
<p>Keeping your equipment in good working order is also part of being 
competent. Using a lowering device with frayed straps is incompetent and 
unethical&mdash;not to mention the fact that it opens you up for an incident 
that could lead to litigation.</p> 
<p>Identification: In the cemetery and funeral profession, a good 
identification system is a required business practice. This is so vital that if 
you do not have a good identification system, both for bodies and grave sites, 
you might be considered unethical.</p> 
<p>Remember: <br>
 &bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Treat each decedent as if he or 
she were related to you.<br>
 &bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Honor your contracts and 
do a good job.<br>
 &bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Maintain your cemetery in a 
fashion that makes you proud.<br>
 &bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Implement checks 
and balances to make sure you properly identify bodies and cremated remains and 
inter remains in the proper place.<br>
 &bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Admit your 
mistakes; contact your customer as soon as you become aware of an error.<br>
 
&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Know and follow the laws and regulations at the local, 
state and federal levels.</p> 
<p>We must do all we can to protect our families, who have suffered the 
ultimate pain of the death of a loved one, from any further grief.</p>

<p><em>Will Garry The Groundhog do for cemeteries what Popeye The Sailor did 
for spinach and Smokey Bear did for forests?</em></p> 
<p></p> 
<p> In most cemeteries, a 6-foot-tall groundhog would be a groundskeeper's 
nightmare. At Calumet Park Cemetery and Funeral Chapel in Merrillville, 
Indiana, it's a welcome sight, especially to children. Garry The Groundhog is 
Calumet's mascot.</p> 
<p>A cemetery and funeral home mascot? Did you laugh as you read that? That's 
the point. Rob Vogel, a fourth-generation Calumet staff member, developed Garry 
as a friendly face for the cemetery and funeral chapel. People smile when they 
see Garry, and children who might otherwise find a cemetery scary flock to him.
</p> 
<p>Groundhog with a purpose<br>
 But Garry is not just another furry face; he 
has experienced loss.&nbsp; Vogel writes about it in &quot;Garry The 
Groundhog,&quot; the first book of a planned series. Garry's grandfather, who 
used to take him to all the beautiful places in Calumet Park, where the 
groundhog family has lived for many generations, &quot;went away with the 
sunset one evening. Mom said he went to a better place where he can always 
watch out for us.&quot;</p> 
<p>Garry goes on to say that Grandpa is still with him, that he sees his face 
as a reflection in the creek or in a cloud. He remembers Grandpa telling him 
about the cycle of life and about families coming to the cemetery to remember 
loved ones, to celebrate life.</p> 
<p>Vogel uses Garry to provide children with a comforting message the adults 
in their lives may have trouble conveying at a time of loss. &quot;We often 
assume that parents have a firm grasp on helping kids to deal with grief,&quot; 
Vogel said, &quot;but our experience has shown that's often not true.</p> 
<p>&quot;Children can be dramatically affected by grief after the loss of a 
loved one. Sometimes they withdraw from their family, as well as from 
activities at school and with their friends. They can lose their sense of 
emotional safety.</p> 
<p>&quot;I practically grew up in a cemetery, my parents and grandparents 
worked in the profession, and yet&mdash;I was surprised to learn&mdash;my 
grandparents kept my dad from going to funerals involving family and close 
friends.</p> 
<p>&quot;I'm a dad myself now, and I'm close to my son. If I were to die 
today, I wouldn't want him to be afraid to go to my funeral.&quot;</p> 
<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Vogel hopes Garry's story will introduce cemeteries and funeral homes to 
children in a non-threatening way, as well as let children who have lost 
someone know ''that they are not alone in their feelings,&quot; Vogel said.</p> 
<p>The story ends with a subtle uplifting note as Garry says that 
&quot;groundhogs burrow in the ground but will always come out to see the 
light.&quot;</p> 
<p>The book&mdash;and DVD and CD&mdash;are aimed at all children, not just 
those facing a loss. &quot;Kids love the character and have fun simply 
listening to stories,&quot; Vogel said.</p> 
<p>Each page is colorfully illustrated by Max Azarov of Gary, Indiana, who 
also designed the Garry the Groundhog Web site and handles distribution of the 
books.</p> 
<p>Garry going global? <br>
 The rodent's love for cemeteries is one reason 
Vogel made Garry a groundhog&mdash;also known as a woodchuck, marmot, gopher or 
whistle pig. Vogel and Azarov think Garry would make a great mascot for 
cemeteries just about anywhere.</p> 
<p>The groundhog is a North American native, but burrowing animals of some 
kind and cemeteries seem to go together.</p> 
<p>&quot;Ninety percent of the cemeteries across the country are home to 
groundhogs or close relatives,&quot; Vogel said.</p> 
<p>Vogel has already been approached about a franchise deal but for now is 
concentrating on helping Garry spread his message beyond Merrillville via his 
Web site, books (for sale via the Web site and at bookstores) and a cartoon 
under development.</p> 
<p>&quot;We're still working out all the details for national exposure. It's a 
step-by-step process,&quot; Vogel said. One way or the other, he promised, 
&quot;Garry will be helping children.&nbsp; There is a need for Garry.&quot;</p>
<p>School counselors have started adopting the book to use, Vogel said. </p> 
<p>Meanwhile, Garry has his paws full in Merrillville. Calumet's children's 
room has a Garry theme, with Garry posters on the wall, a stuffed groundhog 
among the toys and, of course, Garry books for the children to read.</p> 
<p>Garry welcomes people to Calumet for special events. On Mother's Day, he 
handed out flowers. He helped Scouts and other children place American flags on 
grave for Memorial Day. He'll help out at the &quot;fishing for memories&quot; 
contest.</p> 
<p>Garry has already been profiled on the front of the Merrillville Post- 
Tribune's ''Neighbors in Business&quot; section in a story titled &quot;Never 
fear, Garry's here. 'Groundhog' makes cemetery less scary for kids.&quot; Garry 
also threw the first pitch to open Little League season.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Garry will participate in parades, and he's planning visits to hospitals, 
day care centers, schools, bookstores and other cemeteries and funeral homes, 
where he will read his book and play his songs.</p> 
<p>Yes, Garry writes not only stories (with help from Vogel), but also songs 
(with help from Azarov). Each book comes with a DVD of Vogel reading his story 
and Azarov singing the Garry The Groundhog song.</p> 
<p>The song does not mention the cemetery; it's simply a catchy tune about 
being a friend to everyone.</p> 
<p>Listening to the chorus&mdash;&quot;I'm Garry The Groundhog; I'm easy to 
love and hug; I'm Garry the Groundhog&quot;&mdash;you can easily envision a 
group of 3-to-6-year olds singing along at the top of their lungs.</p> 
<p>Garry's adventure will continue through a series of books, Vogel said. 
''He'll tell stories about his grandpa, his friends and a veteran. He'll tell 
about the time he lost his pet caterpillar, Rocky, and the time he fell in 
love.&quot;</p>

<p><em>Recycling the yard waste from your memorial park saves money on 
disposal, provides you with mulch and can lead to positive publicity.<br>
 
Being a good neighbor and a good steward of your land is just good business.
</em></p> 
<p>Gardeners everywhere are aware of the value of good mulch. Mulch is the 
organic top-dressing applied to planting beds and gardens. It provides 
nitrogen, holds water, prevents erosion and reduces weeds, to name a few 
benefits.</p> 
<p>What goes into good mulch is as important as what comes out. With the 
seasons' cycle, leaves fall, storms pass through and renewed growth begins. By 
working with these cycles, cemeteries can benefit and even flourish in the wake 
of seasonal storms.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Let's face it, storms happen. Cemeteries hit by severe weather can sustain 
excessive landscape damage. These parks, with their mature and manicured 
landscapes, can end up having to deal with large amounts of plant debris.</p> 
<p>Many cemeteries still place seasonal leaves, storm debris and pruning 
leavings in the trash. At the cost per load, plus the cost of using precious 
landfill space, this is an expensive solution that can create poor public 
relations.</p> 
<p>Mulching for dollars <br>
 Mulch is any product applied to the top layer of 
the soil to prevent erosion and reduce weeds. Topsoil is what plants prefer to 
grow in.&nbsp; We make our plant beds with topsoil exclusively or by mixing 
topsoil with the existing soil to add nutrients.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>With a good mulching program:<br>
 &bull; leaves are collected seasonally 
and turned into a rich topsoil for the next year's planting and construction 
projects.<br>
 &bull; pruned branches, fallen trees and woody debris are 
chipped and turned into bark mulch as a top dressing for the plant beds.<br>
 
&bull; grass clippings are left on the ground to provide nitrogen and reduce 
fertilizer needed in the lawn beds.</p> 
<p>Evergreen-Washelli Memorial Park, in Seattle, Washington, which encompasses 
140-plus acres, used to annually fill 35 to 45 waste containers, each holding 
30 yards, with the leaves, pruning and fallen limbs generated within the park. 
Now a small portion of the park is set aside so that we can keep this material 
and render it for use within the cemetery.</p> 
<p>The approximately 500 cubic yards of fresh leaves produced every year at 
the cemetery is turned into about 160 cubic yards of good rich topsoil, which 
is used on the grounds.</p> 
<p>The cost of topsoil in our region&mdash;not including delivery&mdash;is 
about $25 per yard, so that 160 cubic yards we make ourselves is worth $4,000, 
plus delivery charges. This is money saved&mdash;on top of not having to pay 
for disposing of 35 to 45 loads of material. The value of a recycling program 
is easy to see.</p> 
<p>Mulching is one of the ways the cemetery maintains its grounds. Each year, 
Evergreen-Washelli uses 150-200 cubic yards of bark mulch. The majority of this 
comes from trees, tree limbs and other woody debris from seasonal storms. In 
our region, bark mulch runs about $30 per cubic yard, so making our own saves 
up to $6,000 right there, in addition to saving us the cost of having the 
debris hauled away.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Setting up the work area <br>
 At Evergreen-Washelli, the recycle area is 
laid out to process and render down large quantities of leaf and wood debris. 
The key to making this work is to separate out the individual products into 
their piles:<br>
 &bull; Separate the leaves from the branches and wood for 
chipping.<br>
 &bull; Place products that cannot be chipped or mulched 
efficiently (such as pine needles and noxious weeds) in a pile to be hauled 
away.<br>
 &bull; Pull out stones and boulders to be used for other projects. 
<br> &bull; Set aside firewood for employees and neighbors to use. </p> 
<p>Evergreen-Washelli mulches its landscape debris in three ways: <br>
 1. 
Lawn clippings are left where they fall. The grounds crew uses mulching mowers, 
and leaves the grass clippings where they fall. Grass clippings left on the 
lawn help replace nitrogen, reduce water evaporation and reduce the amount of 
fertilizer required.</p> 
<p>Excluding grass clippings from the mulch piles means that herbicides used 
on the lawn areas do not get transferred to the mulch material. Herbicides, 
especially those used in lawns to kill dichotomous weeds (plants other than 
grass), can be a serious problem. Mulch contaminated by herbicide may, in fact, 
poison the very plantings it is intended to help.</p> 
<p>2. Leaves are collected in the fall and placed in a pile that's turned and 
pushed throughout the winter to mix and break down the leaves. Depending on the 
weather, the pile is turned once every four to eight weeks. Warm, dry weather 
aids the decomposition process and cold, wet weather slows it down. In very 
cold and wet areas, cover mulch piles with tarps to help retain heat.</p> 
<p>As the leaves age and decompose, the rich final product used for topsoil is 
pushed toward the loading area. The topsoil is used to build new plant beds and 
improve poor soil in existing ones.</p> 
<p>3. Wood debris such as branches, logs and shrubs is collected in an area 
adjacent to the chip pile. Sometimes it's easier to chip the branches in the 
field and dump them in the chipping pile later, and sometimes it's easier to 
haul the branches to the pile and chip them there.</p> 
<p>Either way, the chipped and rendered product gets collected in one area and 
pushed and turned. Eventually it is pushed around toward the loading area for 
final use as a top dressing for plant beds (mulch).</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>It is important to turn the chips on a regular schedule (every six to eight 
weeks). In the center of the pile, the temperature is high enough to cook and 
kill the seeds and break down the material, resulting in clean, well decomposed 
mulch.</p> 
<p>The importance of turning the piles of mulch and topsoil-in-the-making 
cannot be emphasized enough. For large applications, a small bulldozer is best. 
For smaller areas, a front loader is sufficient.</p> 
<p>Turning the piles frequently speeds up the decomposition process and keeps 
odors under control. Noxious smells can become a problem with mulch piles that 
are not turned frequently enough. It's amazing that a pile of fresh leaves can 
smell like fresh manure when decomposing.</p> 
<p>When dealing with serious storm damage, entire trees can be 
destroyed.&nbsp; The first order of business is to ask an arborist to determine 
whether any of the seriously damaged trees can be saved. Where landscapes have 
been uprooted, entire sections of mature plantings may need to be chipped up 
and disposed of and new trees planted. Unless the damage is where you want the 
recycle area to be, you will want to chip the material into trucks and move the 
chips to your recycle area to be processed later.</p> 
<p>It is best to use commercial equipment and professional arborists for this 
type of cleanup and chipping. Since much of the cost savings is due to 
eliminating hauling and dump fees, using professional arborists is the most 
efficient way to clean up after major storm damage.<br>
 &nbsp;<br>
 Plan for 
it!<br>
 Bad weather, dead trees, annual pruning and autumn are unavoidable. 
Set aside an area where you can dump leaves and chips. Provide enough room so 
you'll be able to move the individual piles around.</p> 
<p>In smaller areas such as work yards, bins work efficiently. Typically bins 
10 feet wide and 20 feet deep are set side by side. When the first bin is full, 
the material is dumped into the next bin, where it's turned, and finally into a 
third bin, where the final product is produced for pickup.<br>
 If you are 
fortunate enough to have a large area available within your cemetery or 
memorial park, your recycle area can handle a large amount of storm debris on 
site.</p> 
<p>If by adopting a recycling program you end up with more mulch than you 
need, share it. Gardeners everywhere know the value of good mulch. One of 
Evergreen-Washelli's good-neighbor policies is to make leftover mulch available 
in the fall to their neighbors for pickup. Just think, you could take the 
damage from a serious storm and turn it into a useable and valuable product, 
one with many good customer relation opportunities.</p> 
<p>So stop throwing your money away. Recycle the yard waste from your 
property. Collect your leaves and mulch them into good topsoil. Collect your 
trees, branches and shrub waste and chip them into mulch. What you don't use, 
sell or give away as a community service. All it takes is a little planning.</p>

<h2>Communicating clearly</h2>  Date Published:&nbsp;  January, 2005  Original 
Author:&nbsp;  Tom Smith &amp; Tom Pfeifer  Spring Grove Cemetery &amp; 
Arboretum, Cincinnati, Ohio  Original Publication:&nbsp;  ICFM Magazine, 
January 2005 
<p><em>When you're in the office and you need to get a message to an employee 
somewhere on the grounds, what do you use? Smoke signals? The old tin cans and 
string method? A 20-year-old radio? There's a better way ...<br>
</em><br>
 
WHAT: No matter how prepared you are and how much information you send people 
out with in the morning, there are times you need to relay a message to or ask 
a question of an employee who's in the field.</p> 
<p>At Spring Grove, we've come a long way. From 1845, when the Grove started, 
up till 40 years ago, we were pretty much in the &quot;tin cans and 
string&quot; era, and now we're state of the art. We just purchased a new 
communications system in 2004.</p> 
<p>WHY: The better your communications, the more efficient your operation can 
be and the better you can serve your customers. For example:</p> 
<p>&bull; A committal service is scheduled for 2 p.m. You learn at the last 
minute that the service is going to be delayed to 2:45 p.m. If you can 
communicate easily with employees in the field, they can be doing other things 
until you notify them it's time to head to the service location.&nbsp; 
Otherwise, you're going to have people sitting in their trucks at the scheduled 
time, waiting and waiting-and waiting. The more efficiently you can deploy your 
grounds staff, the fewer people you need.</p> 
<p>&bull; A driver has run into a pole and knocked out electricity in your 
area. Are you at a loss about how to get a hold of people, or does your 
communications system enable you to keep operating when your land lines are 
down?</p> 
<p>&bull; One of your counselors is helping bereaved parents select a burial 
site at need. Can she get answers to their questions quickly via a portable 
device? At Spring Grove, our counselors wouldn't think of going out into the 
field without communications ability. Being able to provide almost instant 
answers projects professionalism.</p> 
<p>&bull; One of your grounds staff members has been corralled by a distraught 
customer. Bringing flowers to his wife's grave, he found a problem with the 
monument. Of course your employee assures him the problem will be taken care 
of. At the Grove, he doesn't have to take our word for it. The employee can 
reach someone to come to the grave site within minutes.</p> 
<p>Just think how much it means to that distraught customer to see a problem 
getting taken care of right away. He'll be telling everyone he knows how well 
the cemetery takes care of its families, and you just can't buy that kind of 
advertising.</p> 
<p>HOW: Unless your communications system is state-of-the-art, you should 
consider upgrading it. As we review the systems Spring Grove has used, setting 
out the pros and cons, think about how your cemetery's system compares and how 
you could improve it.</p> 
<p>The &quot;tin cans and string&quot; era <br>
 This was how the Grove 
operated until about 1960. It was really the &quot;go find the person you need 
to talk to&quot; era. If you had an urgent message for someone who was out on 
the grounds, you'd head in the direction you thought he might be. You'd see 
someone&mdash;not the person you were looking for, of course&mdash;and ask, 
&quot;Have you seen Joe?&quot; And he'd say, &quot;I saw him about 20 minutes 
ago; he was headed up that road.&quot;</p> 
<p>With 40 miles of road at the Grove, what were your chances of finding him? 
More than likely, you'd be led on a wild goose chase for a while&mdash;and that 
was a slow-speed chase, since you can't drive too fast in a cemetery, 
especially when you're looking for someone. A lot of times you'd end up 
deciding you should just head back to the office and talk to the guy when he 
came in for lunch, or at the end of the day.</p> 
<p>Even if you were able to locate someone out on the grounds, it was a 
painful experience. You were always weighing the importance of getting a hold 
of someone vs. the time lost in trying to track him down.</p> 
<p>The radio era <br>
 About 1960, we got tuned into a radio communications 
system. This was before the planned budgeting process we have now, so we 
explained to the trustees why we thought we needed it and they got it for us.
</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>It was just a shortwave radio type of system. At the time, we thought it 
was the best of the best, but it wasn't great. We were tuned into a specific 
frequency, and we'd hear all kinds of chatter from other places.</p> 
<p>The chatter caused a couple of problems. First of all, it was annoying, and 
sometimes people just got tired of it and cut off their radios.</p> 
<p>Second, we had no control over what those other people said. The worst was 
when the University of Cincinnati was adding a large new building and the crane 
operators were on our frequency. Crane operators tend to spend a lot of time 
waiting for that bucket of concrete or whatever to show up, and like anyone 
else, when they don't have work to do they talk, and their language was not 
acceptable.</p> 
<p>When you had a customer with you, you'd have to try to turn down the volume 
as soon as you heard one of those guys start to blurt out an obscenity. It was 
hard to be quick enough, and sometimes you were out of the car and had the 
radio up so you could hear it, which meant that people going by your vehicle 
could hear it, too. There was a lot of explaining and apologizing necessary, 
and this went on for two years!<br>
 In addition to hearing things we didn't 
want to hear, sometimes we couldn't hear at all. The Grove's topography is 
pretty hilly. It seemed like nine times out of 10 the person you wanted to talk 
to was in a low point where the signal didn't reach the little antennas those 
radios had.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>One thing you heard all the time with that system was, &quot;You'll have to 
say it again; I didn't hear the first part&quot; On the other hand, at least it 
was a way to signal people out in the field that you had a message for them, 
even if what that message was wasn't clear.</p> 
<p>Another problem with this system was that all the radios were attached to 
vehicles. That meant every time you heard a squawk from the radio, or wanted to 
call into the office with a question, you had to run back to your car.</p> 
<p>Last but not least was the fact that there was only one guy in town who 
could work on the radio system we had. There was no competition, and if we had 
a problem and he was tied up or on vacation, we were just dead in our tracks.
</p> 
<p>The &quot;new and improved&quot; radio era<br>
 Toward the end of the 
1980s, we finally decided there had to be a better system, so we did some 
research and opted for a Motorola system. We studied the cemetery and found a 
great place to put up an antenna so that we wouldn't have those blind spots 
where you couldn't receive or transmit.</p> 
<p>The new system also allowed us to use hand-held units. We did still have 
some radios in the vehicles, but now we had portability. It was a great 
feeling, having that radio hanging on your belt. Of course, sometimes you 
walked funny, because those radios weighed about 6 pounds.<br>
 And you had to 
replace your belt every few months.</p> 
<p>But having a portable unit was a huge deal. You could keep the volume low 
and still hear what you needed to hear, and the volume control was easy to 
reach.</p> 
<p>Even so, there still was no way to have a private conversation. Everybody 
with a radio heard everything that was said. If you wanted to alert someone 
about a tough situation, a family on their way where the circumstances were 
tragic, everyone heard it, and a lot of times what you heard would make you 
squirm.</p> 
<p>To help with this situation, we came up with a sort of &quot;code&quot; to 
use when talking about certain common situations. For example, a lot of times 
when a burial is going to take place in a wet site, the excavated area will get 
filled up with water when it rains. You never know when the sexton might have a 
family with him, so you don't want someone saying on the radio, &quot;Bring the 
water pump up here I've got a doozy on 132!&quot;</p> 
<p>Our people were taught to say, &quot;I'm going to need the instrument on 
Section 132.&quot; Nobody except our employees knew that &quot;the 
instrument&quot; was the water pump, so that sounded OK to other people who 
might hear it.<br>
 Another problem we still had to deal with was having only 
one channel. If somebody was already on the line, you had to wait until that 
person was finished talking. Sometimes you'd be with a family and you'd have to 
wait five minutes before you could get through and ask your question or relay 
some information.</p> 
<p>We finally asked Motorola if there was anything we could do about this, and 
they started putting a second channel on any new radios we bought. That seemed 
like a good idea until we realized that you can only keep your radio tuned to 
one channel at a time, and if you don't know someone's trying to reach you on 
the second channel, it's useless.</p> 
<p>We were paying a few extra dollars for that second channel, so we had 
brainstorming sessions about how to use Channel 2. It was kind of hilarious. 
The only thing we could figure was to use Channel 2 for tours.</p> 
<p>Sometimes you have a caravan of several vehicles going through on a tour. 
They drive from one stop to the next, get out and then listen to somebody talk.
</p> 
<p>We figured we could give each vehicle a radio tuned to Channel 2 and then 
the tour leader could offer some profundities while everyone was driving. ''On 
your left is a very nice vibernum. To your right is a Gothic memorial.&quot;</p>
<p>Of course, there were still problems. &quot;We can't figure out how to turn 
the volume up.&quot; &quot;Are you sure this thing is on the right channel? We 
keep hearing when the next service is coming in&mdash;and somebody in Section 
132's got a problem with a backhoe pump.&quot;</p> 
<p>Even so, we felt we were moving forward, and we were, but we were 
definitely taking baby steps.</p> 
<p>The two-way radio plus phone era<br>
 About six years ago, Andy Conroy, our 
president at the time, came back from a conference talking about a new two-way 
system someone was raving about.</p> 
<p>We contacted a company representative to learn more. It was a pretty new 
system, and pricey. The cost of getting all new equipment, plus the operating 
costs for daily usage, added up to kind of a staggering number. We weren't sure 
it would be cost effective.</p> 
<p>Last year Spring Grove got a new president, Gary Freytag. We were used to 
the &quot;all call,&quot; everyone-can-hear-everything system we'd been using 
for decades, but sometimes a new person coming in can give you a different 
perspective.</p> 
<p>The receptionist had become almost a clearinghouse of &quot;somebody needs 
to get to a radio to discuss this&quot; messages. She was answering 175 
telephone calls a day as well as talking to people in person, plus she had to 
stay tuned into our radio system.</p> 
<p>When she was with a funeral director or a family, she wouldn't answer the 
radio page right away, so of course we'd repeat the message over and over, 
thinking &quot;Why isn't she answering?&quot; By the time she finally got to 
you, she'd be kind of fired up and then there'd be some bantering back and 
forth.</p> 
<p>Our new president must have heard some of this, and seen customers who 
happened to be around raising their eyebrows, so he had his administrative 
assistant take a look at the costs and benefits of a new communications system.
</p> 
<p>We talked to a couple of suppliers and they let us try out their systems 
for a couple of weeks at no charge. This involved giving units to some key 
personnel so we could see how receptive people would be to using something 
different. There's always some hesitancy when you make a big change.</p> 
<p>At first, some of us wanted to hang onto our old radios &quot;just in 
case&quot; while we tried out the new radio/phone units. Within three or four 
days, we'd forgotten all about our old radios, and in less than two weeks, we 
were saying, &quot;This is unbelievable. We can't imagine ever going back.&quot;
</p> 
<p>With our new communications system:<br>
 &nbsp;&bull; You can contact just 
one person, or use &quot;all call&quot; when you need to let everyone know 
about something. Professionalism and &quot;Disney magic&quot; are the order of 
the day. There's no need for our customers to be exposed to hearing about the 
grunt work that goes on behind the scenes.</p> 
<p>At first, we worried that because we couldn't hear every conversation all 
day we'd lose touch with what was going on around the cemetery, but we do have 
the &quot;all call&quot; capability. We're still working on mastering what 
should be an &quot;all call&quot; and what should be a private conversation.</p>
<p>&bull; There is no usage charge for the two-way radio system. One 
supervisor even called us from South Carolina, where he was on vacation, when 
he remembered something that needed to get done. The sound quality was great.
</p> 
<p>&bull; About 10 of our people have units with cell phone capability. We 
give people usage limits (in minutes) and we get a report on usage from the 
company, since we get charged for outgoing cell phone calls. We've had no 
problems with people abusing them.</p> 
<p>When a manager in the field finds out that a backhoe part didn't show up as 
scheduled, he can make a call right then and there.</p> 
<p>Giving cell phone capability to our supervisors has been a win-win 
situation. Their productivity has increased and they feel more a part of the 
team. They take the units home with them. Of course, this has a downside. As 
long as a manager's got a radio with him and it's turned on, he can be reached.
</p> 
<p>Once Fife was at a restaurant eating chicken wings and watching the Bengals 
game with some buddies when his &quot;Grove Hot line&quot; started ringing. It 
was a security guard calling to ask how to turn on the sound system for a 
wedding that was being held at the cemetery, and Fife was able to give him 
instructions without leaving the restaurant.</p> 
<p>&bull; The units weigh only 3 ounces, so they clip onto your belt without 
weighing it down, and they're rubberized. If you drop a unit, it bounces like a 
rubber ball.</p> 
<p>&bull; There are other options available, including tying the radios into 
Spring Grove's computer system. Right now, that is being done only with the 
PDAs the customer service/security team uses.</p> 
<p>Of course, now that we've made the changeover we have a lot of Motorola 
radios, around three dozen, to get rid of. There's nothing wrong with 
them&mdash;they'll probably work well for someone, so if you're still in the 
&quot;tin cans and string&quot; or &quot;early radio&quot; era, give us a call. 
Have we got a deal for you.</p>

<h2>Calming clients in the cemetery and funeral service profession</h2>  Date 
Published:&nbsp;  January, 2005  Original Author:&nbsp;  Todd Van Beck  A S 
Turner and Sons, Decatur, GA  Original Publication:&nbsp;  ICFM Magazine, 
January 2005 
<p><em>Dealing with clients who are upset with your funeral home or cemetery 
is not pleasant, but it is necessary You want upset clients complaining to you, 
not to everyone else in the community you serve. There are practical ways to 
head off problems, to diffuse situations when problems do occur and even to 
learn things from upset clients that will help you improve your company's 
service to families.<br>
</em>&nbsp;<br>
 Calming upset clients is rarely 
pleasant, but it must be done. The No.1 reason: Bad information travels faster 
than good information. If you please someone, that person will tell three 
people. If you displease someone or if that person is upset, he or she will 
tell 15 people! What's worse, the one person that upset client probably won't 
talk to is you.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>A recent study showed that 96 percent of business clients don't complain to 
the business when they have a problem. This means that for every complaint you 
receive there are 24 unhappy clients.</p> 
<p>As you can see from the information box, &quot;Why you lose business,&quot; 
you should be less worried about price competition and more about making sure 
that families are pleased with the services and products you provide and that 
they feel they have been treated with courtesy and respect by you and your 
staff.</p> 
<p>The second major reason you must deal with upset clients is that you can 
learn from them and improve the quality of service you provide to all families. 
They may clue you in on things that are annoying other clients, who don't speak 
up, as well, or may alert you to behavior by staff members that you are unaware 
of and that is irritating clients.</p> 
<p>In any case, dealing with a client who is upset will teach you patience, at 
the least, and doing so successfully will build your confidence.</p> 
<p>Why do clients get upset? <br>
 Clients can become upset for many potential 
reasons. Among the most common:<br>
 &bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Their 
expectations have not been met.<br>
 &bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They are already 
upset with the company and something has happened to set them off.<br>
 
&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They are tired, stressed, frustrated and in grief.<br>

 &bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They feel like victims and are suffering from loss of 
control over their lives.<br>
 &bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No one will listen to 
them.<br>
 &bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They want to feel &quot;right.&quot; <br>
 
&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They have a chip on their shoulder.<br>
 
&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Someone at your company made them a promise and did 
not keep it.<br>
 &bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Someone at your company was rude, 
indifferent or discourteous.<br>
 &bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They have received 
inconsistent messages from your staff members.<br>
 &bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
They acted on information your staff gave them and it turned out to be wrong.
<br> &bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They feel that someone in your organization 
doesn't like them.<br>
 &bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They were not listened to. <br>
 &bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They have some sort of prejudice against the way you 
or your staff members are groomed or dressed.<br>
 &bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
They feel they can manipulate you by making noise.<br>
 
&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They are suspicious of your organization.<br>
 
&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They had made incorrect assumptions about your company.
<br> &bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They were told by your staff not to be angry. <br>
 &bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A staff member gave them a smart or flip answer.<br>
 
&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The person they were talking to at your funeral home 
or cemetery transferred their call to someone else without first asking their 
consent.<br>
 &bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Their phone call was screened. <br>
 
&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They were embarrassed at doing something wrong.<br>
 
&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Their honesty or integrity was questioned.<br>
 
&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Someone at the funeral home or cemetery argued with 
them.<br>
 &bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your staff was unable to handle a situation 
or question quickly and accurately.</p> 
<p>Remember, annoyances that a client usually tolerates become intolerable 
when that individual is upset. You can't control another person's behavior, but 
you can change your behavior to avoid causing more annoyances.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Avoidable upsets <br>
 First, go back and look at the list of reasons 
clients get upset. Which ones do you have control over? List those you feel you 
can at least partially control and note what actions you could take to keep 
those things from happening.</p> 
<p>The annoyances you have some responsibility for causing are: <br>
 
&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You or someone in your funeral home or cemetery 
promised something that was not delivered.<br>
 &bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You or 
someone in your funeral home or cemetery was indifferent, rude or discourteous.
<br> &bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You or someone in your funeral home or cemetery 
had an unpleasant attitude.<br>
 &bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No one on your staff 
listened to the client.<br>
 &bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Someone told the client 
they had no right or reason to be angry.<br>
 &bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Someone 
gave the client a smart or flip remark.<br>
 &bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Someone 
at the funeral home or cemetery embarrassed the client for doing something 
wrong.<br>
 &bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Someone at the funeral home or cemetery 
questioned the client's honesty or integrity.<br>
 &bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Someone at the funeral home or cemetery argued with the client.</p> 
<p>There are many things you can do to avoid turning a dissatisfied client 
into an angry one through careful attention to your personal presentation and 
to both your verbal and non-verbal communication.<br>
 Personal Presentation. 
This may seem basic, but you should make sure that you and your employees 
present a pleasing appearance at all times by running down this simple 
checklist: good general hygiene, hair clean and well kept, make-up neatly 
applied, face shaved, breath fresh and clothing pressed.</p> 
<p>Non-verbal Communication. The importance of body language has long been 
recognized. You must give the upset client your full attention in a respectful 
manner. You and your staff members should assess yourselves (or each other) in 
the following areas to see where you might improve:</p> 
<p>&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Facial expression: Maintain a calm, concerned, 
sincere and interested expression.<br>
 &bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Body posture: 
Remain attentive by standing or sitting up straight.<br>
 
&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Movement: Clients who are upset want to see 
appropriate action taking place to solve their problems.<br>
 
&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gestures: Do not cross your arms. As awkward as it may 
feel, hold your arms at your side.<br>
 &bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Smoking: Even 
if you are in an area where smoking is allowed, never smoke while you are 
dealing with an upset client.<br>
 &bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chewing gum or 
eating: Again, never do this when dealing with a person who is upset. The 
situation could easily escalate so that you are dealing with an extremely irate 
client.<br>
 &bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Touching: Avoid touching-it could set off 
violence.</p> 
<p>Verbal Communication. See the table &quot;Words that make a 
difference&quot; for a list of common mistakes to avoid and suggestions for 
getting the same point across in a non-confrontational way more likely to move 
the situation toward a resolution. In addition, remember:</p> 
<p>&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Watch your tone of voice. People often respond as 
much to how something is said as to what is said.<br>
 &bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Watch out for sighing. This may be your automatic reaction when you are 
confronted with a difficult situation, but do not do it in front of clients, 
since it suggests annoyance or impatience.<br>
 &bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Never 
curse. Even if the client curses, there is never an excuse for a professional 
to curse.</p> 
<p>Calming upset clients <br>
 What do clients who are upset really want? Of 
course it varies from person to person, from situation to situation. In 
general, one or several of the following applies. They want:</p> 
<p>&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To be taken seriously. <br>
 
&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To be treated with respect&mdash;no condescension or 
arrogance.<br>
 &bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To get immediate action&mdash;no 
&quot;next day, next week, next month&quot; stuff.<br>
 
&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To gain compensation or restitution&mdash;they want 
someone to pay.<br>
 &bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To have the party who wronged 
them reprimanded and/or punished&mdash;they want corrective action.<br>
 
&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To clear up whatever caused the problem so it will 
never happen again.<br>
 &bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To be listened to. This is 
the most important thing to remember when you are trying to calm an upset 
client.</p> 
<p> Improving your listening habits <br>
 There are a number of behaviors that 
make people feel their complaint is not being heard. Dr. Lyman K. Steil of St. 
Paul, Minnesota, compiled a list of trouble spots listed below. Go through this 
list of troublesome listening habits and the suggested corrections to help you 
improve your response to people who are complaining or upset:</p> 
<p>&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Criticizing the speaker and delivery.&nbsp; Focus 
on the client's thoughts and feelings rather than how well he or she is 
expressing them.<br>
 &bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Listening only for facts and not 
feelings. Most people say they are &quot;not&quot; upset, even when they are.
<br> &bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not taking notes or trying to write down 
everything. Taking brief notes shows interest and covers you later. However, 
make sure you are not constantly writing and looking at the paper instead of at 
the person talking.<br>
 &bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Faking attention. Do not 
&quot;tune out&quot; the person and think of something else while he or she 
goes on at length. People don't just want to talk, they want to be heard. Pay 
close attention so that you will be able to respond properly.<br>
 
&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tolerating or creating distractions.&nbsp; Don't be 
distracted and don't tolerate distractions. Hold your calls and tell your staff 
you are not to be disturbed.<br>
 &bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tuning out difficult 
or confusing information. Ask the client to slow down and ask for more details 
if necessary.<br>
 &bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Letting emotional words block the 
message. Ignore name-calling by an irate client.<br>
 &bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Interrupting or finishing the other person's sentences. This is always an 
irritant to a person who is upset. Let him tell his story his way.<br>
 
&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Biases and prejudices. Work on eliminating this.<br>
 
&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not facing the person who is upset.&nbsp; Look the 
person in the eye.<br>
 &bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not checking to make sure you 
have understood the problem correctly. Repeat back to the person what you have 
understood the problem to be.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Use verbal cushions <br>
 Showing that you empathize with the person who is 
upset can help the situation. Try saying something like:</p> 
<p>&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I can appreciate what you're saying.&quot; 
<br> &bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I can understand how you'd feel that 
way.&quot;<br>
 &bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I can understand how that would 
be annoying.&quot;<br>
 &bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I can see how you would 
be upset.&quot;<br>
 &bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I would be upset, too.&quot;
<br> &bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;It sounds as if we've caused you 
inconvenience. I'm sorry.&quot;</p> 
<p>Use the three Fs: feel, felt and found <br>
 &quot;I understand how you 
could feel that way. Others have felt that way too, and then they found that we 
were able to correct the situation without any difficulty.&quot;</p> 
<p> Additional ideas to help you stay in control <br>
 Remember: Don't take 
things personally. Keep your focus on gathering information, assessing the 
situation and coming up with solutions.</p> 
<p>&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you are losing it, excuse yourself for a short 
time. You could say, &quot;I need to verify some information on this file.&quot;
<br> &bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Don't cry! Cry later; never cry in front of an 
upset client.<br>
 &bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Get the client's attention. If the 
client is ranting, use his or her name. Most people stop and listen when they 
hear their name.<br>
 &bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the client is obstinate and 
resisting your suggestions for a solution, ask the client for a solution. 
&quot;What would you like me to do now?&quot;<br>
 &bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Using polite repetition, tell them what you can do for them. Repetition helps 
understanding.</p> 
<p>One caveat: We are talking here about people who are upset or angry, 
perhaps even teary or shouting. But if a client actually threatens violence, 
seek assistance immediately. You do not have to put up with threats, nor should 
you.</p> 
<p>Debriefing after the client has left<br>
 After dealing with an upset 
client, perform an incident review. This should not be a gossiping session with 
fellow employees&mdash;&quot;You won't believe what I just went through.&quot; 
This isn't about you, it's about improving service to your families.</p> 
<p>It's a good idea for staff meetings to include time for sharing staff 
experiences in dealing with upset clients and what worked and what didn't work. 
Talk about what else could be tried if a similar situation arises.&nbsp; In 
some cases, you may want to discuss whether the cemetery or funeral home should 
change a policy or procedure to prevent similar problems or misunderstandings 
in the future.</p> 
<p>To prepare for the staff meeting, review the incident and jot down some 
notes about what happened and how you handled it. Some of the questions you may 
want to consider:</p> 
<p>&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What did I do well in calming this client down? 
<br> &bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What could I have done sooner or better to calm 
him down?<br>
 &bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What did I say that I don't want to say 
again?<br>
 &bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How was my body language? <br>
 
&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What did I learn?</p> 
<p>Guidelines for managers <br>
 Your goal as manager of the funeral home or 
cemetery is to create an environment conducive to client satisfaction.</p> 
<p>&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Be a role model. Don't expect your staff to use 
good listening skills and deal empathetically with people if you don't do so 
yourself.<br>
 &bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ask for your staff's suggestions. Talk 
about how to better serve families at staff meetings.<br>
 
&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Solicit client feedback. You can send postage-paid 
return cards or surveys to families after serving them, or solicit the 
information through telephone calls.<br>
 &bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Reward good 
client service behavior.<br>
 &bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Encourage your staff to 
use their initiative to solve problems. You have to set limits, of course, but 
you don't want staff members further angering already upset clients by 
responding to every problem with an &quot;I can't authorize that&quot; or 
&quot;I'll have to ask my boss.&quot;<br>
 &bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Don't talk 
negatively about clients.&nbsp; This fosters a negative atmosphere; you want to 
promote a positive approach to dealing with families.<br>
 
&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Know when to fire a client! If a client continually 
upsets your staff for trivial reasons, you may need to invite that client to 
consider another firm. As extreme as this may sound, it is a potential 
solution. Some families do call a funeral home or cemetery that is not a good 
match for their needs and desires, and their disappointment ends up being 
expressed in continual nastiness.</p>  Code:&nbsp;  A1376

<h2>Grow goodwill with green giveaways</h2>  Date Published:&nbsp;  October, 
2006  Original Author:&nbsp;  Tom Smith &amp; Tom Pfeifer  Spring Grove 
Cemetery &amp; Arboretum, Cincinnati, Ohio  Original Publication:&nbsp;  ICFM 
Magazine, October 2006 
<p> Cemeteries are valuable greenbelts.<br>
 You know that, but does your 
community?<br>
 To publicize how your grounds benefit everyone<br>
 in the 
area, try these ways of &quot;spreading the green.&quot;</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>WHAT: One way of using your cemetery's natural assets to generate goodwill 
is to invite people to enjoy events on your beautiful grounds. Spring Grove 
certainly does that throughout the year, and your cemetery probably does, too.
</p> 
<p>But we also believe in exporting a bit of nature as a way to remind people 
that we're an arboretum as well as a cemetery. We're about the cycle of life, 
and you can't give people a better symbol of renewal and rebirth than a growing 
plant.</p> 
<p>WHY: Plant giveaway programs can generate good news coverage and draw 
people in who may not have visited your cemetery before. They don't have to be 
annual events. Try the ones we describe here, or come up with your own tailored 
to your community and your cemetery, or to a special event in your community 
like a centennial celebration.</p> 
<p>It's a subtle way to get your name out in front of the community, to be a 
good neighbor and a good citizen. When an at-need situation arises, maybe 
someone will remember your cemetery because of one of these programs.</p> 
<p>And we can't emphasize enough the need to constantly build goodwill in the 
community, to generate good news stories as often as possible. Because no 
matter who you are, no matter how hard you try to have a perfect safety record, 
there may come a day that something goes wrong and the unhappy family runs to 
the media. When that happens, you want to have a long history of good news so 
that people will weigh that against the bad.</p> 
<p>HOW: We do &quot;green outreach&quot; in a number of ways; we're going to 
describe three in detail. We've found these three to be cost effective and 
enjoyable for our employees and the public.</p> 
<p>1. The Pansy Program. This is one we just started last year, so we're still 
working on perfecting it, but we love this idea. We get some tough winter 
weather here in the Midwest, and we thought it would be nice to do something to 
celebrate the rebirth of the outdoors environment as we start coming out of the 
doldrums of winter. In our area, pansies seem to represent that idea.</p> 
<p>We decided we'd give away pansies to everyone who comes into the office. We 
start in mid-February, which is a little ahead of the curve as far as the end 
of winter. Occasionally we'll get one of those surprise 6O-degree days, but 
overall it's one of the ugliest months of the year in Cincinnati. The cemetery 
looks like it's taken a &quot;whupping,&quot; with tracking where we've had 
equipment even though we tried to put boards down. The sky is gray, there's not 
a bud on a tree.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Just think how great it is to go into an office, maybe to complain about 
something, and as you're leaving the receptionist says, &quot;Thank you for 
corning in; we'd like you to have this nice flower to take home and 
enjoy.&quot; Here's this colorful pansy looking you in the eye. How can you not 
smile when you see a pansy?</p> 
<p>Did the bank give you a flower? No. The dry cleaner? No. The grocery store? 
No. But the cemetery did, and it brightened up your day. And the employee who 
handed it to you enjoyed doing it, too.</p> 
<p>It's amazing how the expression on people's faces change when you hand them 
the flower and tell them it's free. We include a brief care sheet telling 
people they can either put the potted pansy on a windowsill and be inspired by 
it for a couple of weeks, or place it outside.</p> 
<p>It doesn't have to be a pansy. Maybe you want to give out petunias, or some 
other flower. Pansies work well for us because even though the name makes them 
sound wimpy, they're actually tough plants. They'll tolerate extremes in 
temperatures, so the cemetery doesn't have to worry about keeping them inside 
just because it's going down to 20 degrees at night. Pansies love cold weather, 
damp rainy weather.</p> 
<p>You can order them from a local grower, or grow them yourself in your 
greenhouse. Bring as many into the office as you think you'll need that day, in 
little pots. Any you don't give out that day can go back outside&mdash;you 
can't keep them inside too long or they start to yellow.</p> 
<p>Start planning now, and say &quot;welcome, Spring 2007&quot; with flowers! 
</p> 
<p>2. The Arbor Day Tree Giveaway. We don't do this every year, though it's 
not very expensive, and it's a natural for cemeteries. Really, is there a 
cemetery anywhere that doesn't have trees?</p> 
<p>When we do it, we team up with the city's urban forestry division. Almost 
every city has one, or a parks division or something similar. Call up and say 
you'd like to partner on an Arbor Day project. (Arbor Day is the last Friday in 
April, by the way.)</p> 
<p>One way is to buy seedlings wholesale, maybe for the top two or three 
plants for your area, and work with the forestry or park people to get them 
delivered to any schools or libraries who want to do an Arbor Day planting. 
Newspapers are always looking for a tree planting to take a picture of for 
Arbor Day, and if your cemetery donated the tree, you hope that will get 
mentioned in the photo caption or story.</p> 
<p>Another way to give out trees is to announce that you'll be giving away 
seedlings to the first 200 families (parent or parents and at least one child) 
who come in to the cemetery during a particular time period, maybe the Saturday 
before or after Arbor Day. You want the child there to talk to about the 
importance of Arbor Day and trees in general. Having a child also makes for a 
better visual for the newspapers or television.</p> 
<p>You want the parents there for obvious reasons. You'll have a chance to 
introduce yourself, hand over a card or brochure and ask if you can put them on 
the mailing list for your newsletter. So it's a subtle way to get some names of 
people you can eventually approach to talk to about preplanning.</p> 
<p>Don't forget to notify the media that you'll be giving away seedlings. 
They're on the lookout for Arbor Day stories, so &quot;this year. the ABC 
Cemetery is giving away dogwoods and blue spruce seedlings to beautify the 
community and celebrate Arbor Day&quot; is news.</p> 
<p>This is something you should start out small with, maybe 200 seedlings, 
depending on the size of your community. If you run out of seedlings, put 
people on a list to get one later and have a second pick-up day scheduled.<br>
 
&nbsp;<br>
 You can get a tremendous number of seedlings for a few hundred 
dollars. When deciding which seedlings to choose, you want to look for native 
plants that are reasonably priced, easy to transplant and have a high 
survivability rate. (You can ask the forestry or parks division, or your local 
Extension agent, for suggestions.)</p> 
<p>You don't want Mommy, Daddy and Johnny planting a seedling, getting all 
excited, watching it grow and then going outside one day to find that it's 
died. Fife remembers Arbor Day as being Silver Maple Giveaway Day when he was a 
kid, probably because those trees can survive anywhere, so that's what everyone 
handed out.</p> 
<p>The bigger the seedling, the higher the cost, of course, but you don't want 
to give people a tree so dinky that no one can really see it and it's going to 
get run over and chopped up by the lawnmower. You can buy a decent sized 
seedling sometimes for pennies and certainly for less than $1 a piece.</p> 
<p>We give away seedlings 18 to 24 inches high&mdash;significant enough so you 
can see them. We buy them in bulk and repackage them. You can make a fact sheet 
with transplant and care instructions on it to give out, and a tag maybe with 
your logo on it that you can attach to the tree.</p> 
<p>Or, since you have to repack the seedlings in planting bags with a little 
sphagnum moss to maintain the moisture, you could use a bag with your logo and 
the care instructions right on the bag.</p> 
<p>The garden editors come running when we do the Arbor Day seedling giveaway. 
What better advertising can you get than a picture of a child getting his free 
tree as mom and dad look on? People look at that photo and say to themselves, 
&quot;Man, that Spring Grove&mdash;they're always doing good things.&quot;<br>
 
&nbsp;<br>
 3, The Patented or Special Plant Program. Spring Grove has a 
Patented Plant Program&mdash;yes, some of our plants have been patented. But 
you don't need a patented plant to do this, just a tree or flowering bush 
that's special in some way and can offer &quot;babies&quot; to the community.
</p> 
<p>Maybe you have a great white oak tree you've been mowing around for years. 
It's got a majestic form and a huge canopy in the summer; it provides late fall 
color; its beautiful branches and white bark look phenomenal against the winter 
sky. You don't have to patent it&mdash;just identify it, maybe even name it!</p>
<p>Then make it available to the gardening public. Collect its fruit&mdash;the 
acorns&mdash;to give away. You could take the next step, of course, and plant 
the acorns yourself, then give people the seedlings as little potted plants. 
Either way, this is a fun giveaway.</p> 
<p>When you think about it, a lot of cemeteries have been around 50, 70, 100, 
150 years, and have plenty of plants that have endured over time. Take 
photographs of your magnificent tree or plant so people can see what great 
stock the acorns or cuttings come from, then write a little story about your 
giveaway to send to the press.</p> 
<p>We sell some of our patented plants across the country through our Web 
site, popular plants that will grow probably in 60 to 75 percent of American 
gardens. But we're suggesting this as a low-cost giveaway limited to your 
community.</p> 
<p>This doesn't have to be tied to Arbor Day (though it could be), but should 
be done during a good planting season, meaning spring or fall. As always, 
include a fact sheet, maybe saying something such as &quot;this is a direct 
progeny of the champion/the biggest white oak on Section 23 of ABC 
Cemetery.&quot;</p> 
<p>Remember, it doesn't have to be a tree, it just has to be a plant that's 
relatively easy to propagate. We've done this with some of our shrubs. Check 
with your Extension agent for suggestions.</p> 
<p>Maybe you have a nice flowering vibernum&mdash;a plant that's adaptable to 
90 percent of American gardens. You recall that the previous superintendent 
said the plant was there, and thriving, when he arrived 30 years ago. It's 
endured droughts, severe winter and summer weather and flooding. What better 
test is there? (Be sure to mention that in your press release.)<br>
 &nbsp;<br>

 There's no law against naming it the ABC Cemetery Vibernum, taking some 
cuttings and offering them to the community. Make sure you have photos of it 
when it's blooming, or that you send out your press release when it's blooming 
so the newspaper can get a good photo.</p> 
<p>&#9788;&#9788;&#9788;&#9788;&#9788;&#9788;&#9788;</p> 
<p>We've tried to plant a seed of an idea with this column. Why not try one of 
these programs next year? Your employees will get inspired&mdash;they'll like 
being a part of this type of goodwill effort.</p> 
<p>After all, being in the cemetery business could be a bit of a downer if it 
weren't for the fact that we're always trying to do some of these uplifting 
things, too.</p>  Code:&nbsp;  A1370

<h2>Meeting OSHA's Bloodborne Pathogen Standard and protecting your employees
</h2>  Date Published:&nbsp;  January, 2006  Original Author:&nbsp;  Shannon 
DeCamp  TechneTrain Inc., Cincinnati, Ohio  Original Publication:&nbsp;  ICFM 
Magazine, January 2006 
<p><em>Of course embalmers need to be wary of bloodborne pathogens, but 
they're not the only ones in your funeral home, crematory or cemetery who might 
face exposure. Make sure your employees&mdash;and your company&mdash;are 
protected.<br>
</em><br>
 Exposure to bloodborne pathogens is a significant 
risk to employees of the cemetery, funeral and crematory professions. 
Violations of OSHA's Bloodborne Pathogens Standard were the most prevalent 
citation in the profession in 2004. While OSHA citations are infrequent 
relative to other industries, the last thing you want is this type of notoriety 
when your goal is to offer your clients competence, caring and peace of mind.
</p> 
<p>While staff who handle bodies for funeral or cremation are likely have 
expertise and extensive background in mortuary science, and hence a good 
understanding of the risks and methods of controlling exposure to bloodborne 
pathogens, you may have ancillary employees who don't have knowledge and 
training but may directly or inadvertently come into contact with body fluids 
at your facility.</p> 
<p>Your custodial staff, florists, drivers and designated first aide 
responders might all fall into this category. Do you ever hire a beautician to 
do hair or ask a yard worker to help lift a body? Add them to the list.</p> 
<p>OSHA's Bloodborne Pathogens Standard (general industry standard 29 CFR 
1910.1030) details the specific requirements for your facility's exposure 
control program and your obligations to all employees with occupational 
exposure.</p> 
<p>Let's start by reviewing the basics of the Bloodborne Pathogens Standard to 
ensure that your business is meeting OSHA requirements.</p> 
<p><strong>Bloodborne Pathogen Standard </strong><br>
 Bloodborne pathogens 
are viruses and bacteria in human blood that can cause disease in humans, 
including the Hepatitis B and C viruses and the human immunodeficiency virus, 
or HIV.&nbsp; Workers exposed to these pathogens risk serious illness. The HIV 
will survive for only a few days in a body; but Hepatitis B is a relatively 
common infectious disease that is potentially present in the body of any 
individual being prepared for burial or cremation and can survive for 30 days 
or more.</p> 
<p>Since medical histories and examinations cannot accurately detect all 
patients infected with pathogenic agents, universal blood and body fluid 
precautions should always be used.</p> 
<p>The Occupational Safety and Health Administration standard was established 
in 1991 to eliminate or minimize occupational exposure to Hepatitis B virus, 
HIV and other bloodborne pathogens. The agency concluded that exposure to these 
pathogens can be minimized or eliminated using a combination of engineering and 
work practice controls, personal protective clothing and equipment, training, 
medical surveillance, Hepatitis B vaccination, signs and labels and other 
provisions.</p> 
<p><strong>The key elements of the Bloodborne Pathogen Standard are: </strong>
</p> 
<p><strong>&bull; Exposure determination.</strong> Assess the risks of 
exposure to bloodborne pathogens (generally in the form of potential contact 
with body fluids) that employees may encounter at their work place. List the 
tasks and locations where this contact can occur (i.e., cleaning out the 
refrigerated storage area).</p> 
<p><strong>&bull; Written exposure control plan.</strong> Establish written 
policies for protecting employees against exposure to bloodborne pathogens as 
they complete these tasks.</p> 
<p><strong>&bull; Engineering and work practice controls.</strong> Establish 
and regularly update engineering and work practice controls that will control 
employee exposure.</p> 
<p><strong>&bull; Labels and signs.</strong> Use required labels and signs to 
caution employees where exposure risks exist. This does not include public 
spaces such as crypts or viewing rooms.</p> 
<p><strong>&bull; Personal protective equipment.</strong> Provide appropriate 
personal protective equipment to shield employees from exposure risks.</p> 
<p><strong>&bull; Employee information and training.</strong> Inform employees 
about the risks identified. Train employees on your specific program to 
minimize or eliminate the risks associated with exposure to blood borne 
pathogens.</p> 
<p><strong>&bull; Vaccinations.</strong> Provide Hepatitis B vaccinations at 
no cost to any employees who will potentially be exposed as a part of their job.
</p> 
<p><strong>&bull; Post-exposure follow-up.</strong> When an employee is 
exposed, the employer must provide a no-cost medical evaluation.</p> 
<p><strong>&bull; Recordkeeping.</strong> Maintain records of employee 
training, as well as of injuries and accidents related to any bloodborne 
pathogen exposure in the workplace.</p> 
<p>The standard stresses the need to use &quot;universal precautions&quot; in 
dealing with exposure to potential bloodborne pathogens in the work 
environment. This means operating under the assumption that any contact with 
blood or body fluids may result in a potential exposure to bloodborne 
pathogens&mdash;regardless of the diagnosed condition of the source of the 
blood or body fluids.</p> 
<p>Now let's discuss what exactly is involved in meeting the OSHA standard. 
</p> 
<p><strong>1. Exposure determination </strong><br>
 Each employer must prepare 
an exposure determination that lists any and all job classifications in which 
employees have occupational exposure, and lists all tasks and procedures where 
occupational exposure can occur. (The fact that your embalmers wear protective 
gear which protects them during exposure does not mean you can declare that 
your embalmers are not exposed to bloodborne pathogens.)</p> 
<p><strong>2. Written exposure control program </strong><br>
 Whenever any 
employee's anticipated duties may result in occupational exposure to bloodborne 
pathogens, the employer must establish a written Exposure Control Plan to 
minimize or eliminate exposure.&nbsp; The plan must be designed around the 
concept of universal blood and body fluid precautions. This written Exposure 
Control Plan must contain at least the following elements:</p> 
<p>&bull; An exposure determination (see # 1). <br>
 &bull; The schedule and 
method of exposure control.<br>
 &bull; The procedure for evaluating 
circumstances surrounding exposure incidents.</p> 
<p>Employers must ensure that employees have access to a copy of the Exposure 
Control Plan. This plan must be reviewed and updated at least annually, or 
whenever new or modified tasks and procedures affect occupational exposure.</p> 
<p><strong>3. Engineering and work practice controls </strong><br>
 
Engineering and work practice controls must be used to eliminate or minimize 
employee exposure. Where occupational exposure remains after institution of 
these controls, personal protective equipment must also be used. Engineering 
controls must be examined, and maintained or replaced, on a regular schedule to 
ensure their effectiveness. Examples of engineering controls include:</p> 
<p>&bull; Establishing needle-handling and disposal procedures. <br>
 &bull; 
Prohibiting eating, drinking, smoking, applying of cosmetics or lip balm and 
handling of contact lenses where there is a reasonable likelihood of 
occupational exposure.<br>
 &bull; Performing procedures involving blood or 
other potentially infectious material in a way that minimizes splashing, 
spraying, spattering and generation of droplets of these substances.<br>
 
&bull; Placing appropriate labels and signs in the work area.<br>
 &bull; 
Cleaning and straightening areas where bodies are stored or prepared for burial.
<br> &bull; Providing hand-washing facilities. </p> 
<p><strong>4. Labels and signs </strong><br>
 Appropriate warning labels must 
be affixed to containers of regulated waste, refrigerators and freezers that 
contain blood or other potentially infectious material, and other containers 
used to store, transport or ship blood or other potentially infectious 
materials.</p> 
<p><strong>5. Personal protective equipment. </strong><br>
 When there is 
occupational exposure, the employer must provide, at no cost to the employee, 
appropriate personal protective equipment. This could include:<br>
 &bull; 
gloves,<br>
 &bull; gowns, <br>
 &bull; shoo covers, <br>
 &bull; laboratory 
coats,<br>
 &bull; face shields or masks and <br>
 &bull; eye protection. </p> 
<p>Some jobs may require only gloves and eye protection, while others may 
require a gown, face shield, shoe covers and gloves for full body protection. 
Personal protective equipment is considered &quot;appropriate&quot; only if it 
does not permit blond or other potentially infectious materials to pass through 
to or reach the employee's work clothes, street clothes, undergarments, skin, 
eyes, mouth or other mucous membranes under normal conditions of use for as 
long as the protective equipment will be used.</p> 
<p>The employer must ensure that the proper personal protective equipment, in 
the appropriate sizes, is readily accessible at the work site, or is issued to 
employees. Hypoallergenic gloves, glove liners, powderless gloves or other 
similar alternatives must be readily accessible to employees who are allergic 
to the gloves normally provided. The employer must dean, launder, repair or 
replace all required personal protective equipment as needed to maintain its 
effectiveness, at no cost to employees.</p> 
<p><strong>6. Employee information and training </strong><br>
 Employers must 
ensure that all employees with occupational exposure participate in a training 
program, which must be provided at no cost to employees and rake place during 
working hours. Training must be provided at the time of initial assignment to 
tasks where occupational exposure may rake place, and at least annually 
thereafter.</p> 
<p>Employers must provide additional training when changes in tasks or 
procedures affect an employee's occupational exposure. Training must be 
appropriate to the education level, literacy and language of each employee.</p> 
<p>The minimum training program requirements include: <br>
 &bull; an 
accessible copy of the regulatory text of OSHA's Bloodborne Pathogens Standard, 
and an explanation of its contents;<br>
 &bull; a general explanation of the 
epidemiology and symptoms of bloodborne diseases;<br>
 &bull; an explanation of 
your Exposure Control Plan, and information on how employees can obtain a 
written copy of the plan;<br>
 &bull; an explanation of the appropriate methods 
for recognizing tasks and other activities that may involve exposure to blood 
and other potentially infectious materials;<br>
 &bull; an explanation of the 
various methods&mdash; and their limitations&mdash;that can be used to prevent 
or reduce exposure, including engineering controls, work practices and personal 
protective equipment;<br>
 &bull; information on the types, proper use, 
location, removal, handling, decontamination and disposal of personal 
protective equipment;<br>
 &bull; an explanation about how to select personal 
protective equipment;<br>
 &bull; information on the Hepatitis B vaccine; <br>
 
&bull; information on the procedures to be followed when any exposure to blood 
or body fluids occurs;<br>
 &bull; an explanation of the signs, labels and 
color-coding required to identify hazards; and<br>
 &bull; an opportunity for 
employees to ask questions of the person conducting the training session.</p> 
<p>The person conducting the training must be knowledgeable in the subject 
matter as it relates to the workplace, and be able to answer any employee 
questions.</p> 
<p><strong>7. Vaccinations </strong><br>
 Hepatitis B vaccination. The 
employer must make the hepatitis B vaccine and vaccination series available to 
all employees who have potential occupational exposure within 10 working days 
of their initial assignment, at no cost to the employees and at a reasonable 
time and place. These vaccinations must be performed by or under the 
supervision of a licensed physician or another licensed health care 
professional according to the recommendations of the U.S. Public Health Service 
current at the time that these evaluations and procedures take place.</p> 
<p><strong>8. Post-exposure evaluation and follow-up </strong><br>
 Following 
a report of an exposure incident, the employer must immediately make available 
a confidential medical evaluation and follow-up, at no cost to the employee.</p>
<p>This follow-up must include the identification and documentation of the 
individual who was the source of the material to which the employee was 
exposed, unless the employer can establish that identification is not feasible 
or prohibited by state or local law.</p> 
<p>The employer must ensure that all laboratory tests are conducted by an 
accredited laboratory at no cost to the employee. The employer must obtain and 
provide the employee with a copy of the evaluating health care professional's 
written opinion within 15 days of the completion of the evaluation.</p> 
<p><strong>9. Recordkeeping </strong><br>
 The employer must establish and 
maintain an accurate record for each employee with occupational exposure, in 
accordance with 29 CFR 1910.20. Training records must be maintained for three 
years from the date on which the training occurs.</p>  Code:&nbsp;  A1357

<h2>Safeguarding your records &amp; maps</h2>  Date Published:&nbsp;  January, 
2006  Original Author:&nbsp;  Brandon Finley  Ramaker &amp; Associates, Inc.  
Original Publication:&nbsp;  ICFM Magazine, January 2006 
<p><em>Cemetery records are a treasure trove of important historic and current 
information for both families and communities.<br>
 This irreplaceable data, 
once lost, can never be recovered. Or can it?</em></p> 
<p>Hurricane Katrina recently gave us a vivid reminder of the fragility of 
traditional cemetery records. On August 29, 2005, a 30-foot storm surge at 
Gulfport, Mississippi, leveled the city cemetery office building, located two 
blocks from the beach. Where once a sturdy building stood, only a concrete slab 
remained.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Vicki Parkhill, the city's cultural affairs officer, remembers the storm 
aftermath: &quot;I arrived at the office and found that the storm surge had 
washed the building and its contents off the cement slab. I began to cry, 
because I could not believe this hurricane did this. The records 
gone&mdash;everything gone. Nothing was left. Just a site of absolutely 
nothing.&quot;</p> 
<p>Years of plot and operations information, recorded on thousands of cemetery 
lot cards, was lost. To add to the confusion, the loss of life in Gulfport 
created an immediate need for cemetery services.</p> 
<p>What if this type of disaster&mdash;hurricane, tornado, fire&mdash;struck 
your cemetery office? Would you be ready for business again in one day? One 
month? One year? A data disaster recovery plan is crucial to your business. So 
what are your options?</p> 
<p><strong>Disaster plan options </strong><br>
<strong>Basic, low-cost.
</strong> The most basic and least expensive option is to make simple copies of 
your lot cards. Cemetery records also can be scanned into computer file 
&quot;photocopies.&quot;&nbsp; They can be saved in a variety of file formats, 
including JPEG and PDF. These file types can be opened by most basic computer 
software for viewing, but not modifying. Store the paper or computer file 
copies in a fireproof container or room, above flood level.</p> 
<p>The key to this disaster recovery plan is to store the backup copies at a 
remote location. The building down the block may not be in the same fire, but 
could be struck by the same tornado, flood or hurricane. The remote location 
must be far enough away from the primary record storage to avoid complete data 
loss from the same disaster.</p> 
<p>The short-term benefit of copying lot cards is the cost. The initial 
expense is minimal compared to other options. The drawback is the long-term 
upkeep of the offsite records. The records at the remote location will quickly 
become outdated, especially financial records. Updating paper backup records is 
very important, but time-consuming.</p> 
<p><strong>Automated.</strong> The next level of data protection is to 
automate your cemetery records with a cemetery management software package. 
Cemetery management software has the obvious benefits of greater operations 
accuracy and efficiency.</p> 
<p>The disaster recovery benefits are less tangible, but equally important. 
Cemetery management software usually has a backup function built in that 
requires only a blank CD or backup tape and the click of a button. With one 
recent backup tape or CD of the computerized records, a cemetery can recover 
from total record loss within hours.</p> 
<p>The location of the backup media is again important, but much less space is 
required for storage. Remember to create backups daily or weekly to keep the 
data current. If you are backing up records only once a month or quarterly, you 
are not taking advantage of the full disaster recovery benefits of your 
software.</p> 
<p><strong>Remember your maps.</strong> Lot cards are not the only records 
which can be lost or damaged. Cemeteries often rely on multiple maps to track 
lot locations and owner or burial information.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Imagine your situation if your cemetery maps suddenly disappeared. How many 
months&mdash;or years&mdash;would it take for you to go through the lot cards 
to recreate a complete map?</p> 
<p>If your lot cards were also missing, would it even be possible to recover 
all the information? Creating a backup map should be an important part of your 
disaster recovery plan.</p> 
<p>Many maps are handwritten on oversized paper, with manual color 
categorization. Photocopies of oversized paper may be available at some 
printing companies, or a specialized map company.</p> 
<p>Check with the company first if you need a color copy; oversized color 
copying services are more expensive and less widely available.</p> 
<p>Store the backup maps according to the same guidelines used for storing the 
lot card backups, and avoid storing them in direct sunlight. Direct sunlight 
can deteriorate some types of paper or cause ink to fade.</p> 
<p><strong>Smart maps.</strong> The alternative to paper copies of cemetery 
maps is computerized, interactive &quot;smart&quot; maps. Using Geographic 
Information Systems (GIS) technology, your cemetery can be mapped into a 
computer file. Combining multiple paper maps prevents data accuracy issues 
usually associated with referencing multiple maps for a variety of information.
</p> 
<p>The computerized map is integrated with the cemetery management software 
for &quot;point and click&quot; access to information formerly kept on maps and 
lot cards. Even financial records can be linked to your map. The map is then 
included in the built-in backup function of the software.</p> 
<p><strong>Past disasters.</strong> GIS maps are great disaster recovery 
safeguards against future problems, but what if disaster has already struck? 
Let's say a building fire burned all your cemetery maps and records in 1960, or 
a vandal removed headstones in 1943. Is there anything you can do now to locate 
occupied versus vacant burial sites?</p> 
<p>If a small number of lots need exploration, digging or probing may be an 
effective option. However, care and time must be taken to prevent damage to 
caskets or, worse, emotional damage to family members who find a recently 
excavated burial site within their plot.</p> 
<p>Technology provides larger cemeteries or cemeteries hoping to minimize site 
disturbance with an alternative to manual excavation. Ground penetrating radar 
[discussed in detail in the March-April 2004 ICFM] has been used to scan 
cemeteries that experienced record loss at some point in their history.</p> 
<p>The radar scans the ground for inconsistencies and creates of rough outline 
of objects below the surface. It can outline a burial, a large buried rock, or 
even a utility line. The map created by the radar can be integrated with an 
existing, interactive &quot;smart&quot; map. If you need to know which lots are 
unavailable for burial because of blockage in the ground, or to verify those 
available for sale, you may want to consider ground penetrating radar.</p> 
<p><strong>What did Gulfport do?</strong> <br>
 So what happened to the City 
of Gulfport Cemeteries after Hurricane Katrina wiped out the office? By a lucky 
twist of fate, earlier in the year the city had shipped all of their lot cards 
and cemetery maps off to a vendor (Ramaker &amp; Associates) for scanning. The 
lot cards and maps had been returned to the city just two weeks before the 
storm hit, so they were all washed away.</p> 
<p>When she saw that the cemetery building&mdash;and all of the paper 
records&mdash;were wiped out, her initial reaction was shock, Parkhill said. 
&quot;I couldn't think. Then I realized Ramaker had all the cards and maps 
scanned. I was so excited!&quot;</p> 
<p>Parkhill called the company to find out what information the city could get 
to replace the lost data. Within 24 hours, the city received electronic copies 
of all documents via e-mail; and within a week, hard copy versions of all lot 
and burial cards were shipped down to Mississippi.</p> 
<p>&quot;What a relief,&quot; Parkhill said. &quot;Because there were copies, 
we'll be able to rebuild and revive our cemetery records.&quot; The City of 
Gulfport Cemeteries disaster is a perfect example of data automation literally 
saving a cemetery from total record loss.</p> 
<p>To safeguard your cemetery's data integrity against potential data loss 
disasters, which level of protection will you choose? It may depend on your 
risk comfort level and judgment about costs and benefits, but it is important 
to have some sort of plan in place. Otherwise, what will you say after a 
disaster strikes and a client comes in to ask for the location of the plot 
purchased 30 years ago? Will you say, &quot;I can get the information to you in 
a few days,&quot; or &quot;I'm sorry, I might know next year sometime.&quot;</p>

<h2>How to sell your old mowers, blowers and tractors for top dollar</h2>  
Date Published:&nbsp;  February, 2006  Original Author:&nbsp;  Tom Smith &amp; 
Tom Pfeifer  Spring Grove Cemetery &amp; Arboretum, Cincinnati, Ohio  Original 
Publication:&nbsp;  ICFM Magazine, February 2006 
<p><em>You don't need to set up an eBay store to sell that old equipment 
you're not using anymore. All you have to do is clean it up, advertise it 
and-most important-auction it off as a single lot.</em></p> 
<p><strong>WHAT:</strong> Do some spring cleaning by selling the equipment you 
don't need anymore or are replacing.</p> 
<p>Spring Grove has one sale a year, near the end of winter. We accept sealed 
bids, and we make people bid on everything. We used to sell pieces of equipment 
individually, and what always happened is there were some things everyone 
wanted and other things no one wanted.</p> 
<p>Now, even if you only want four of the 12 pieces of equipment we're 
selling, you have to bid on all of it. Maybe you resell some of it, maybe you 
junk some of it. We don't care what you do with it, as long as you get all of 
it off Spring Grove property by the deadline!</p> 
<p>By selling it all as one lot, the amount we get for our old equipment is 
staggering compared to what we used to get. We can buy three mowers for the 
money we get by selling our old equipment.</p> 
<p>The winning bid depends on what we've got in the mix, of course. If there's 
a quad (an all-terrain vehicle), or a four-wheel-drive vehicle, people go 
crazy. They'll bid on the whole lot just to get that quad.</p> 
<p><strong>WHY:</strong> Equipment you don't use anymore and can't trade in 
takes up space. It needs to be inventoried. It costs time and money to take it 
to the landfill&mdash;if you eve, get around to doing it. And it's a potential 
revenue source that's dropping in value every day you allow it to just sit 
there.</p> 
<p>Besides, selling your old equipment to someone who can put it to use is in 
the spirit of &quot;reduce, reuse and recycle.&quot; It's nice that some of 
this equipment can be put to good use for a few more years instead of being 
buried somewhere.</p> 
<p>As we've already said, selling equipment a piece at a time is not the way 
to go. This isn't a terribly complicated program, but you do need to do a bit 
of planning.</p> 
<p>1. <strong>Know what you're buying and what you can get rid of.</strong>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Being able to do this properly is contingent on having a good 
budgeting process. At the Grove, we know what equipment is being replaced 
months before we sell it. If you're not sure how many new mowers you're going 
to buy, it's going to be hard to decide how many of your existing ones to sell.
</p> 
<p>You might think, &quot;Well, I'll just sell the old equipment off as the 
new equipment comes in.&quot; The problem with that is you'll end up having 
multiple sales, and you know what rule number 2 is:</p> 
<p>2. <strong>Sell everything as one lot, auction winner take all.</strong> 
This not only means you won't have any leftovers; it's also a way to clear out 
some of your old inventory. At one point, we had about 20 push-type blowers 
that had been in inventory for years, replaced with newer, easier-to-use 
models. Every year we throw a few into the mix. Sure, some of the bidders say, 
&quot;What am I supposed to do with those?&quot; Our answer is, &quot;We don't 
care what you do with them, they're just part of the auction.&quot;</p> 
<p>There is some equipment you can either trade in or sell outright and get 
big bucks for&mdash;a backhoe, for example. For the auction, you'll be 
gathering small pieces such as soil-hauling equipment and mowers, of course.</p>
<p>We don't hold a live auction; we accept sealed bids. Since people don't 
know who they're bidding against, you tend to get higher bids, especially if 
you have a piece of equipment in the lot that people really want. If you have a 
John Deere Gator or any kind of all-terrain vehicle, that will draw bidders. 
And tractor prices are spectacular. If you have a tractor of any size in the 
mix, you will generate lots of excitement.</p> 
<p>3. <strong>Put auction conditions in writing.</strong> <br>
 Tell people 
the deadline for accepting bids and the deadline for the winner to remove the 
equipment. We also reserve the right to refuse any bid and give potential 
bidders a list of the equipment with a note that there is no warranty on any of 
it&mdash;it's being sold &quot;as is.&quot; (They are buying used equipment, 
after all.)</p> 
<p>4. <strong>Put someone in charge of handling the details.</strong> One of 
our mechanics handles the sale, getting bids and meeting the people who want to 
come by and look at the equipment before bidding. Usually we get about a dozen 
bids.</p> 
<p>At this point, we only advertise the sale every other year. We've been 
doing it a while, and we let the regular bidders know when it's time for the 
auction. You do want to advertise periodically, though, to bring new people 
into the process.</p> 
<p>Early March is a good time to hold the sale. The winning bidder will have 
time to retrofit that mower or put that new alternator in the ATV before the 
weather warms up.</p> 
<p>5. <strong>Be honest with potential bidders.</strong> We do clean up the 
equipment, since making it presentable is going to payoff in higher bids, but 
we answer questions honestly. &ldquo;This mower had a problem with 
such-and-such. We've had those mowers three years, we run them 50 hours a week 
and we can't afford to take a chance on one of them being out of service for 
several hours, so we're replacing them. But for the average person who uses a 
mower two hours a week, they should be good for years.&quot;</p> 
<p>The guy who has won the auction the last couple of years runs a business 
cutting grass and also sells equipment.</p> 
<p>Every year, usually in April or May, we get calls from people asking if 
we've got any equipment for sale. We tell them who won the auction.</p> 
<p>Even though there's only one winner&mdash;and even though the winner has to 
take some old leaf-blowers off our hands&mdash;all the bidders ask to be 
notified about next year's auction.</p>  Code:&nbsp;  A1339

<h2>Top 10 Cemetery Best Practices</h2>  Date Published:&nbsp;  May, 2006  
Original Author:&nbsp;  Patrick Monroe  Rose Hills Memorial Park, Whittier, 
California  Original Publication:&nbsp;  ICFM Magazine, May 2006 
<p><em>You need good employees, of course, but to make everything work right, 
you also need formal business processes, policies, procedures and automation.
</em></p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to tell you how to run your cemetery; I'm simply going 
to describe 10 &quot;best practices&quot; based on what we're doing at Rose 
Hills. It's up to you to decide whether they would work for your organization.
</p> 
<p>How do you determine something is a &quot;best practice&quot;? We use five 
criteria:</p> 
<p></p> 
<p> 1. Does it do something for the customer? Does it improve the delivery of 
products or services for your families?</p> 
<p>2. Does it benefit your company? Does this practice help you become more 
profitable, reduce costs or increase safety?</p> 
<p>3. Does it benefit the employee? Does it increase employee morale, or 
foster teamwork and buy-in?</p> 
<p>4. Does it also improve the community? </p> 
<p>5. Does it raise the bar for the entire profession and make funeral and 
cemetery services that much more relevant to consumers?</p> 
<p><strong>The Rose Hills Top 10 </strong></p> 
<p>10. <strong>Have in place a good performance management system.</strong> 
You can't hit the target if you don't know what you're aiming at. A good system 
becomes an effective tool for communicating with your employees.</p> 
<p>The system we've been using is built around the job position profile, which 
is different from a job description.</p> 
<p>A job description basically lays out what a job is; the education 
requirements for it and so forth.</p> 
<p>A job profile has three key items: the parts of the job, the standards for 
doing it and SMART goals. Have you ever heard anyone say, &quot;In my job I 
wear many hats?&quot; When you're creating a job profile, you're listing those 
&quot;job hats.&quot;</p> 
<p>At Rose Hills, the members of my operation team all have very similar job 
parts, such as operating within budget, or delivering customer service at 
levels we set for ourselves. Also, all managers and supervisors are expected to 
always have their safety hat on, so there is a risk management job part.</p> 
<p>Leadership is also a major component of their jobs, so we need to identify 
what good leadership looks like. For instance, are we communicating effectively 
with our team and our staff?</p> 
<p>All our managers at Rose Hills have a human resources development component 
to their jobs, meaning they're expected to train and grow and nurture their 
employees.</p> 
<p>And lastly, our managers and supervisors have a personal development aspect 
to their jobs. We expect people to participate in events such as ICFA training, 
evening classes, the Chamber of Commerce&mdash;something outside of work to 
develop their skills.</p> 
<p>Each of these job parts has what we call a job standard. For business 
management, it might be something like: &quot;Performance is satisfactory when 
all planned projects are completed on time and on budget. Performance is 
satisfactory when targeted customer service goals are achieved or 
exceeded.&quot;</p> 
<p>Each job part has one or more related job standards, and these typically 
don't change from year to year. If you're in the same job, what's expected of 
you doesn't change from year to year.</p> 
<p>However, certain job standards will have what we call SMART 
goals&mdash;specific, measurable, attainable, results-oriented and 
time-specific.</p> 
<p>For example, let's say you have a person whose job standard is, 
&quot;Performance is satisfactory when all assigned projects are completed on 
time and on budget.&quot; That job standard will be the same, whether it's 
2006, 2007 or 2008. But the SMART goal for 2006 might be, ''Project X will be 
completed within budget by June 30, 2006.&quot; You want to be able to know 
whether the goal has been achieved or not.</p> 
<p>9. <strong>Institute written policies and procedures.</strong> Most of our 
employees really want accountability and standards, and I think written 
procedures are the way to get there.</p> 
<p>There are many advantages to written procedures. They provide some 
consistency in how the job gets done. They are objective and results-oriented. 
And they provide a mechanism for constructive feedback and corrective action, 
and for performance reviews.</p> 
<p>There are five key elements we embed in all our procedures: </p> 
<p>&bull; Define the job in terms of what success in this job looks like. </p> 
<p>&bull; Describe the process step by step. </p> 
<p>&bull; List the skills and talents required to do the job. </p> 
<p>&bull; Name the specific safety standards associated with that job. </p> 
<p>&bull; Include productivity standards. </p> 
<p>Having written policies and procedures can also help you in other ways, 
such as being able to share them with other departments. A couple of weeks ago, 
we did a presentation for 200 of our preneed counselors about our interment 
process, and we shared our procedures. The more our employees know about what 
other departments are doing, the better, and having written policies and 
procedures makes it very easy to share this information.</p> 
<p>Also, we have the policies and procedures for our subcontractors and 
vendors. We want to make sure they know what our safety rules are, and we 
expect them to follow our park etiquette standards. Our contractors sign off on 
that, and we expect them to follow through, or they're not coming back.</p> 
<p>8. <strong>Keep a focus on career development.</strong> You want to hire 
and recruit, train and retain the best quality people you can, so it's not just 
a human resources department function, it's an operational management and 
leadership function to focus on career development.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Examine the diagram at the top of this page. Someone with a low skill level 
and a very high challenge is going to feel anxiety because he or she can't do 
the job right. Someone with a very high skill level and a low-level challenge 
could be bored.</p> 
<p>We don't want our employees to be in a state of either anxiety or boredom; 
we want them &quot;in the zone,&quot; where their skill level and job challenge 
are well matched. Managers need to work with employees and understand where 
their zone is, and create a career path and career opportunities to keep them 
in it.</p> 
<p>It's difficult to orchestrate opportunities, but it's important. In the 
past, a new person would come to work at Rose Hills, go through training and 
rotate through jobs, but not really have a career path.</p> 
<p>That wasn't working, so we came up with something new. We developed a 
career path for all employees based on skill acquisitions. As people acquire 
skills and experience, they are automatically promoted to another level and 
have an opportunity to increase their compensation. Our employees are so much 
more valuable to our organization as they grow those skills. We meet with each 
person on a quarterly basis and analyze their career development plan to make 
sure they're progressing.</p> 
<p>7. <strong>Develop a vehicle, equipment and facilities maintenance program.
</strong> We have formal written maintenance programs in place. With 100+ 
vehicles in our fleet, we maintain written records of everything done to each 
vehicle.</p> 
<p>We have five working chapels on our property, and 500,000 people visit them 
each and every year. It's critical that those facilities look as good as they 
can. People are forming impressions about Rose Hills, and funeral and burial 
ceremonies, when they enter our property.</p> 
<p>We do a weekly inspection of all our public facilities, everything from the 
speakers to the AV equipment. We check the restrooms to make sure the toilet 
dispensers and the faucets are working.</p> 
<p>Don't forget your employee work areas. You can tell the quality of an 
organization by looking behind the scenes. It's important that your employees' 
work areas are safe and neat and well maintained.</p> 
<p>6. <strong>Conduct internal inspections and quality control and compliance 
audits.</strong> At Rose Hills, our parent company does annual inspections. 
Someone comes in unannounced and looks at all our procedures and safety 
compliance and writes a report. We also have somebody on staff who does this. 
Not every organization is going to have a staff person who can do this, but if 
you don't, maybe you can subcontract it out.</p> 
<p>5. <strong>Fully disclose the nature of services before you render them.
</strong> We all know about the waivers, disclosure forms, at-need and preneed 
contracts, general price lists. What I've found is that you have to have these 
things, but most people don't read them. We try to focus on informal methods of 
communicating the important things.</p> 
<p>Avoid industry speak. Nothing drives me crazy more than hearing somebody 
say, &quot;I'm looking at Mrs. Smith on her ROC&rdquo;&mdash;using terms that 
clients don't understand.</p> 
<p>Brochures, handouts and web sites are obviously great tools to inform 
people about the business, but nothing replaces good, strong product knowledge 
and training for your people.</p> 
<p>Also, we're beginning to leverage other influencers in the process-clergy, 
senior associations, leaders and so forth. Get these people involved, and 
sometimes they can be your best advocate and explain things to families.</p> 
<p>4. <strong>Have a good system for resolving customer dissatisfaction.
</strong> Do you have systems in place that resolve customer dissatisfaction? 
Statistics tell us that every person who has a problem with a company tells 10 
other people&mdash;the worst type of advertising.</p> 
<p>The most important thing is to address the issue immediately. Customer 
service issues are not like fine wine; they do not age well. We want our staff 
to address problems with the family immediately, since that's the best bet for 
restoring the customer's confidence.</p> 
<p>Make sure you listen and get the whole picture before acting. Don't start 
trying to solve a problem before you've got all the facts. And don't blame 
others. I had a situation not too long ago where one of our supervisors was 
solving a customer service problem and said, &quot;Well, the preneed person 
should never have told you that.&quot; That didn't give the customer a lot of 
confidence in our organization.</p> 
<p>Separate the objective problems from the subjective. An objective problem, 
for example, is a cracked marker, a scratched casket or dead flowers. In those 
cases, you know what you have to do: give a refund or replace the product.</p> 
<p>The bottom line is, do the right thing. I can't tell you how many times 
we've won the battle but lost the war with customer service. A family has 10 
spaces, and we're fighting them over $100 worth of flowers. To try to avoid 
this, we tell staff, &quot;If you make a decision favoring the customer, you're 
not going to get into trouble if you err too much on their side.&quot;</p> 
<p>Of course not everyone who has a problem is going to tell us about it, so 
we use customer surveys. We ask the family, &quot;Would you recommend us?&quot; 
We want the answer to be &quot;yes&quot; at least 98 percent of the time.</p> 
<p>3. <strong>Leverage technology.</strong> Walk around the convention this 
week. It blows you away how much more technology is in our industry than there 
was five years ago. Make your web site as useful as possible. We do $10,000 a 
month in flower sales for grave placement, and the family finds the online shop 
a great tool&mdash;they don't have to drive all the way out in L.A. traffic to 
put flowers on the grave.</p> 
<p>We're beginning to use document imaging technology to replace a lot of the 
old manual recordkeeping. And we're using a park data resource system involving 
little handheld laptops so our staff can provide information to families in the 
field.</p> 
<p>2. <strong>Know thy customer.</strong> This needs to be the mindset of all 
your operational managers. Cemetery master planning, facilities 
design&mdash;everything needs to be built around what you know about your 
customers.</p> 
<p>We know where all our property owners live. We can graph our property owner 
distribution by zip code. More important than demographic information is 
psychographic information, which deals with people's attitudes, beliefs, 
religious preferences and lifestyle. You can do focus groups, survey your 
families and talk to your employees to get this type of information.</p> 
<p>We also need to consider all the people involved in the funeral and 
cemetery decision process. This includes not only the buyers but also the 
initiators, who gather information; the deciders; and the influencers, such as 
clergy and hospice.</p> 
<p>All customers have both articulated and unarticulated needs. If customers 
are telling you what they want and you're meeting their needs, you're not 
getting any bonus points, because that's what they expect. That's the basic 
level of service. Pleasant surprises you offer a family&mdash;&quot;Wow, I 
didn't know you did that&quot;&mdash;get you bonus points.</p> 
<p>1. <strong>Put safety first.</strong> We've got to have a razor-sharp focus 
on safety through three different lenses:</p> 
<p>&bull; Safeguard the deceased, from the removal to the time the casket is 
lowered or the deceased is transferred to the crematory. If you have 
subcontractors, are you inspecting them?</p> 
<p>&bull; Safeguard your employees. OSHA requires safety procedures, and we 
don't view that as a burden. You want your employees to be safe, and they want 
to see that you care about their safety. We do a lot of safety training.</p> 
<p>&bull; Safeguard your visitors. You need to go around you, pack and look 
for anything that could endanger visitors. Is there a slipping hazard 
somewhere? Is that construction project properly marked with signs and cordoned 
off'?<br>
 &nbsp;<br>
 Most of the things on this list are not quick and easy. 
They take hard work, but I can tell you from personal experience that they pay 
huge dividends. It's a lot easier to grow weeds than it is to grow grass. These 
things are going to help you grow grass</p>

<h2>The Subdividing of a Cemetery Into Sections, Lots and Single Grave 
Districts</h2>  Date Published:&nbsp;  September, 1909  Original Author:&nbsp;  
W. N. Rudd  Original Publication:&nbsp;  AACS Proceedings of the 23rd Annual 
Convention 
<p>It should be understood that the following notes apply more particularly to 
cemetery tracts of the larger sizes, not especially diversified in topography, 
adjoining the larger cities and in which the first cost of the ground is high 
and the expenses of development heavy. It may be stated that they are written 
more especially for conditions where the platted lots represent a cost of 
$2,000 and upwards per acre, exclusive of buildings, and where the average 
price obtained per square foot is 75&cent; or more; it being understood also 
that a large proportion of the lot and grave owners are of the poorer classes 
and necessarily desirous of being as economical in their expenditures as 
possible.</p> 
<p>In those cemeteries where the first cost of the ground and the subsequent 
development are low, a more liberal allowance as to the sizes in the smaller 
lots and the space allowed for the single graves will be permissible. It is 
always to be remembered, however, that every additional foot of ground entails 
a continuing additional expense for future care; that every foot of ground 
needlessly used for drives, either by excessive width of the roadway or by 
providing for more drives than are absolutely necessary, is a serious burden 
for the future. There is not only the loss of the receipts from the sale of the 
ground so wasted, but the continuing heavy expense of maintaining the extra 
driveway, which is very much greater than the expense of maintaining the same 
area in lawn or shrubbery planted ground.</p> 
<p>SECTIONS</p> 
<p>The sizes and shapes of the sections will, of course, be determined by the 
general landscape plan and the layout of the roads; each separate tract 
surrounded by driveways being considered a section, although it will generally 
be found advisable to divide the spaces lying between the driveways and the 
boundaries of the cemetery into several sections by lines cut through the 
narrower parts. It is not a good practice to arrange for the driving of carts 
into the sections for the purpose of removing grave dirt and the like and the 
writer believes it is generally abandoned. For convenience in working, 
therefore, these sections having, drives on both sides should not exceed 300 
feet in width except where the lay of the ground makes it absolutely necessary 
and on the other hand they should not be greatly less than 200 feet in width, 
both through motives of economy and from the standpoint of general effect. The 
sections along the boundaries which have a drive on only one side should not 
exceed 150 feet, nor be less than 100 feet in width as a general rule.</p> 
<p>It is our custom considering the high cost value of the property, to allow 
only ten feet free space between the boundary sections and the line fence, 
this, of course, being densely planted to trees and shrubbery. The formal 
hedge-like appearance which it would otherwise obtain being avoided by running 
the planting out at intervals, somewhat more thinly, into the lots.</p> 
<p>The length of the sections should not be less than three times their width 
and we find sections 700 to 800 feet long not to be objectionable. The laying 
out of these long sections saves the loss of ground, the expense of making and 
the maintenance of large areas of driveways.</p> 
<p>Another point to be considered is that practically all the vistas in 
cemetery landscape are down the drives and the adjacent lots, and the only way 
that long and attractive views can be obtained is by long sweeps of slightly 
swinging drives; the adjacent lots being deep, the monuments being placed at 
the back part of the lot and planting undulating towards and away from the 
driveways to conceal many of the monuments in the long vistas and partly 
conceal practically all of them. It is to be hoped; however, in this connection 
that no cemetery superintendent will attempt to make the final layout of his 
grounds without calling in the assistance of some landscape architect who has 
had long and successful experience in, the laying out of cemeteries. No matter 
how competent the superintendent is or how long his experience in cemetery work 
has been, his training is in the line of administration and development and the 
writer believes that in ninety-nine cases out of one hundred the aid of an 
experienced landscape gardener will be of untold value, not only to the 
superintendent himself but to those who employ him. It is, not the business of 
the cemetery superintendent to design a cemetery. His work is to develop the 
cemetery after the plans are made and to administer the affairs in a 
businesslike way. He is not an artist but a hard-headed business man. Of 
course, it is necessary that he have a wide knowledge of the technical parts of 
the work and thoroughly appreciate the results desired to be obtained from the 
plans. The work of laying out the cemetery should be done by consultation 
between the landscape gardener and the superintendent, the former giving his 
wide knowledge and general experience, the latter modifying the ideas of the 
former to fit the particular conditions with which he is necessarily so 
familiar.</p> 
<p>LOTS</p> 
<p>When the point of the subdivision of the sections into lots is&bull; 
reached, then the work must be done by the superintendent. Conditions in the 
different cemeteries differ so greatly that it is impossible to properly and 
economically subdivide the section without an exact and intimate knowledge of 
local conditions and of the character and wishes of the people who patronize 
the cemetery.</p> 
<p>In those cemeteries where a large proportion of the lot buyers are 
well-to-do or wealthy people, the lots, of course, will be laid out into larger 
sizes and less regard will be paid to keeping them in shapes best, adapted for 
the maximum number of burials with the minimum use of ground. On the other 
hand, in cemeteries where a large proportion of the lot buyers belong to the 
poorer classes the lots must be laid out in smaller sizes, as nearly 
rectangular as possible and the dimensions so figured as to allow the greatest 
possible number of burials in the smallest space.</p> 
<p>Returning again to the subject of vistas along the drives, the reasons 
given there make it necessary that the lots adjoining the drives be large ones 
and that they have good depth; a minimum depth of twenty feet should be the 
standard and this should be increased to forty feet or more to as great an 
extent as it is possible to dispose of such large lots. A planting space of not 
less than two feet should be left between the lots and the drives. This is 
useful as a place for the laying of water pipes and occasional drains, forms a 
protection to the lot against vehicles and horses and prevents the setting of 
any headstone too close to the drive. A wider space up to four feet would be 
desirable from many points of view, but considering the loss of ground and the 
expense of maintenance it is not to be generally advised.<br>
 &nbsp;<br>
 The 
minimum depth of the front lot, as stated, is twenty feet. This, with the 
planting space of two feet, gives a depth to the back of the lot of twenty-two 
feet and if the monument is placed within a foot or so of the back of the lot 
and the other lots on the other side of the drive are treated in a similar way, 
an open stretch of ground of fifty feet or more, including the drive, is 
preserved unobstructed by monumental structures. Adjoining the front lot and 
extending back to a four foot walk parallel with the drive should be another 
lot a little shallower than the front lot perhaps, or of equal depth. The 
minimum depth, however, of any lot should not be less than 17 feet. This gives 
space for two tiers of graves with their headstones (16 feet) and six inches 
between the borders of the lot and the ends of the graves, which should be the 
minimum allowance, one foot, of course, being better. Where some very large 
lots are desired and the laying out of the whole outer border into very deep 
lots would produce too many of the larger sizes, they can be alternated, one 
lot running clear over to the back walk, being 37 feet or more in depth, the 
next being cut into two, a front lot of 20 feet and a back lot of 17 feet.</p> 
<p>A walk of four feet in width, it will be noted, has been recommended. The 
writer has found it an absolute waste to layout any walk over four feet in 
width. This gives ample space for drains and water pipes and as there is no 
teaming in the sections, there is no need for anything wider. At occasional 
intervals cross walks are to be constructed, running in as far as the first 
walk, at right angles with the drive and then going square across the center of 
the section on lines best adapted to the rectangular subdivision of the inside, 
turning again at the opposite side of the section to meet the opposite drive at 
right angles.</p> 
<p>Several points must be considered in determining the width of the lots on 
the drives. It should be understood that all dividing lines between these lots 
must be erected perpendicular to the drive. The width of the front of the lot 
where it is desired to make the lots rather small and especially where the 
drive curves outward strongly, must be fixed by a. minimum width of the inside 
lot on the walk, as it is to be remembered that setting the dividing lines 
perpendicular to the drive makes them approach more closely as they come to the 
inside walk and if the front on the drive is made narrow, the front on the 
inside walk will be too short. In such cases it will be necessary to space off 
minimum widths along the walk for the inside lots and let the frontage of the 
outside ones come as it will by dropping perpendiculars. On the other hand, 
where the drive curves in, the reverse condition will exist and the minimum 
frontages must be spaced along the drive and the perpendiculars allowed to 
strike where they will on the inside walk.</p> 
<p>One of the main things to be done in dividing a section into lots is to see 
at the time that no subsequent grouping or crowding of monuments can possibly 
occur. Where a large demand exists for small lots, it is an excellent practice 
to layout alternately two wide ones and then two narrow ones, the narrow ones 
to be sold with the agreement, which is entered in the deed, that no monument 
shall be ever erected upon them. In this way a large number of very: desirable 
small lots can be provided and yet the general appearance of the grounds be in 
no way injured. Our practice in the cheaper parts of the cemetery is to make 
these small lots 8&frac12; or 11 feet front in the narrow part. By placing 
burials close together this gives three graves in width and allows a six inch 
space between the outer graves and the lot line. An 8&frac12; foot front by 17 
feet deep will give six graves with headstones. We do not in practice, however, 
layout anything less than 18 feet deep. In the larger lots grave spaces of 3x9 
are allowed and from that on up to 4x10.</p> 
<p>When this part of the work is decided upon and the lots staked with 
temporary wooden stakes, we have a planting space of two feet wide running 
entirely around the section, a lot 20 feet or more in depth back of that, 
another lot 18 feet or more in depth further back and adjoining it, and a walk 
four feet in width running entirely aroui1d the section and parallel with the 
drive, connected at convenient intervals by cross walks with the drives. These 
lots, will none of them be square, although where the drive does not curve very 
much, they are approximate rectangles and the stronger the curve of the drive 
the more wedge shaped they will be. Enclosed by this walk is the center area of 
the section and the aim should be to divide this area into rectangular plots of 
sizes adapted to meet the requirements of the lot buyers. Unless this part of 
the section is very desirable and is well elevated, it is proper to subdivide 
it into small lots, in so far as they are needed. Our own practice in regard to 
very small plots, that is three and four grave lots, is to layout lots 17 feet 
front and 18 feet in depth. These can be re-divided into halves, making two 6 
grave lots, or .into quarters making four 3 grave lots, or into two spaces 9x11 
and one space 6x18, making three 4 grave lots; all of these small lots, of 
course, to be sold without the monument privilege. A lot on which a monument is 
to be erected should not be less than 20 feet in depth and the maximum frontage 
should not be less than 11 feet. This width is almost too narrow, however, 
unless on each side of the lot a no-monument lot is laid out. Two monument lots 
11 feet front and adjoining each other will bring the monuments less than 10 
feet apart, which is certainly an objectionable practice. In the no-monument 
lot the size of 11x19 covers an 8 grave lot, or 13&frac12;x18 covers a 10 grave 
lot. 11X20 and 13&frac12;x20 make monument lots of similar capacity. In the 
better parts of the ground 12X20 is a more desirable size for an 8 grave lot 
and from that on up.</p> 
<p>Careful planning is necessary to avoid, as far as possible, triangular lots 
or lots with long, sharp, tapering corners. Of course, some spaces of this kind 
will be unavoidable, but it is our practice to cut off these sharp corners and 
throw the small triangles into the walk, leaving spaces which can be planted 
with shrubs or used for waste receptacles if surrounded by shrubbery. In 
practice each lot, of course, is given a frontage on a walk and if two lots are 
18 feet in depth this will make the walks 36 feet apart. Cross walks, of 
course, must be provided at intervals. We have not found it necessary to make 
cross walks closer than 200 feet apart, and have not found 240 or even 250 feet 
very objectionable. One point to be remembered in the laying out of all lots is 
to have no curved lines. Curved lot lines as laid out by the surveyor by the 
swinging of a radial line, are very objectionable and very difficult to 
re-establish after monuments and headstones are erected on the lots. If the 
drive curves very strongly so that a straight line drawn from corner to corner 
of the front leaves too much width in the planting space, one or two points may 
be set in along the roadway two feet from its edge and straight lines may be 
drawn connecting them, the idea being to have every boundary line of a lot a 
straight line which can always be verified and the points replaced if 
necessary. In the case of a circular section, which, by the way, is an 
abomination, points may be set at frequent intervals, maintaining the circular 
edge of the roadway but making the lot an octagon or similar figure. Small 
triangular sections, which are always to be avoided when possible, or if they 
are used must be sold at a very high price in order to reimburse for the waste 
ground and the additional driveway, may be laid out by erecting perpendiculars 
from the center of each of&bull; the three sides to meet at a middle point, 
making three lots. The pointed ends of other sections may, of course, be thrown 
into one lot in this way.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>In laying out walks, due regard must be had for the general direction of 
the travel. If the natural course of visitors is lengthways of the section, 
then the walks must be run largely lengthways, otherwise paths will be worn 
across the lots. It should be born in mind that every foot of ground in a walk 
is not only a loss but a constant future expense for care, and much study must 
be given to so laying out the lots that the minimum amount of ground will be 
wasted in walks.</p> 
<p>After all the lots are staked temporarily, a rough plat or sketch of the 
section should be made, the lots given their proper numbers, and concrete 
corner posts prepared and set at the outside corners, or such other markers as 
may be decided on. The inside corners may be marked by white topped terra cotta 
markers. The plan in force for marking lots with us, which has worked 
exceedingly well and saved much time by reason of the visitors being able to 
find the lots without having some one sent to show them the way, is to have the 
outside corner posts made eight inches square (we should reduce this to about 6 
inches, however, except for the sake of uniformity, having started on the 
8-inch basis). Each marker contains the word &quot;Sec.&quot; and the number of 
the section. In addition to that the word &quot;Lot&quot; is twice repeated and 
the numbers of two lots, it being set one-half in each lot. In this way the 
visitor, by finding one corner stone, knows immediately what section he is in. 
The stones are made of concrete 18 inches deep and are faced off like a cement 
sidewalk; the letters and figures are properly assembled in a form and pressed 
in at one operation. The expense of these posts, set in place, of course, flush 
with the ground, is about 35&cent;, dependent largely on the cost of material, 
with labor at $2 per day. It is very strongly to be advised that all corner 
stones be made and set at once. The work can be done very much cheaper if all 
are set at once instead of setting one by one as the lots are sold; there is no 
subsequent trouble over the loss of stakes, no subsequent variation by errors 
in replacing stakes with the stones and if the work is done in this way the 
final surveying, measuring and platting of the lots can be left until the 
permanent markers are in. In addition to this it will be found a great 
convenience in showing and selling lots and make it possible to largely avoid 
the exceedingly annoying error of showing a man one lot and giving him a deed 
for another number.</p> 
<p>If the cemetery is laid out into 200 foot square, the intersections, of the 
lot lines with the lines of those 200 foot squares can be noted, the lots then 
measured up and platted very readily.</p> 
<p>SINGLE GRAVES</p> 
<p>Single graves are of two classes--the common single grave which is designed 
to be sold at the very lowest possible price, and the select or preferred 
single grave which is practically a small lot for one interment. The less 
desirable parts of the grounds should be selected for single grave districts, 
and preferably they should be adjoining the boundary of the cemetery and in a 
location where the visitors to the lots will not pass them. They should, also, 
if possible, be so located that the crowds of people going to and from the 
single graves will not be tempted to cross other sections and wear paths in the 
sod. A very large area should be provided, if possible, to cover all needs in 
common single graves for many years. This should be of sufficient width to take 
50 or more adult graves side by side and should adjoin a drive. A very good 
practice is to call this one large lot and to subdivide it into long strips at 
right angles to the drive. These strips are of sufficient width to take an 
adult grave and headstone; that is, 8 feet in width and if calculated for 50 
graves should be 125 feet long, 2&frac12; feet being allowed for each grave 
space; rough boxes in this locality running 26 or 28 inches wide. Of course, 
where the general run of adult rough boxes is wider, more space will have to be 
allowed.</p> 
<p>These tiers are numbered generally from the south line of the lot north, as 
Tier 1 North, Tier 2 North, etc.; the graves in each tier being numbered from 
the driveway. An 8-inch square stone is set along the drive at each tier, 
marked &quot;Sec. -, Lot -, Tier I North,&quot; etc. and another similar stone 
should be placed at the other end of the tier. By stretching a line between 
these two stones, all the graves in the tier can be carefully lined up and the 
headstones can easily be set in the proper location. The grave spaces being 
accurately maintained, if it is desired to find any grave in the tier, no 
matter if all stakes and other markers have disappeared, it is simply a case 
for careful measurement.</p> 
<p>The graves in the tiers are to be marked with round cement or tile markers, 
each marker bearing two numbers; the number of the tier above, which will be 
the same for each grave in the tier, and below, the number of the grave in the 
tier, which, of course, will vary for each grave. The description of any grave 
is entered in the grave receipt as follows: &quot;Lot _, Section _, Tier __ 
North, Grave __&rdquo;.&nbsp; With this description and a little explanation it 
will be found that the grave owners can in almost all cases locate the grave 
they are looking for, thus saving a very large amount of time in the future 
which would otherwise be used in pointing out the location.</p> 
<p>It will be noted in this article that the writer pays no attention to 
laying out the grounds for the burial of bodies east and west. In the locality 
of Chicago the old idea that all bodies should be buried due east and west has 
been abandoned and no attention whatever is paid to the points of the compass. 
The lots face in all directions and the burial is made entirely with reference 
to the conditions of the individual lot.</p> 
<p>Headstones, of course, in the single grave sections will be kept very low, 
preferably not over six inches high, will be limited to one foot in thickness 
and not less than six inches and should be made six inches narrower than the 
width of the grave; that is, 24 inches, or less.</p> 
<p>Between every four tiers, that are 32 feet apart, four foot walks are 
placed for drains, water pipes and access. Of course, this system contemplates 
that no mounds whatever shall be raised on the common single graves. The 
burials are begun at the point farthest from the drive and progress towards the 
drive, to avoid passing over the graves already buried.</p> 
<p>The select or preferred graves are a higher priced proposition and should 
be of larger area and may be in better locations. We have found it a not bad 
proposition to take small lots here and there in the cheaper sections of six or 
eight grave, capacity and divide them, selling them out singly. They being so 
few in number and being maintained in the same way as the lot graves, they have 
not been found to be objectionable. (These graves are numbered on the same plan 
as the common singles; that is, the description of any grave will carry the lot 
and section number and will be Tier __ North, East or West as the case may be, 
and Grave __, North, East, or West, as the case may be.</p> 
<p>* * *<br>
 The laying out of lots and single grave districts is not a 
matter in itself of great difficulty, although it requires accuracy in the 
making of the final plat and very careful study. Bad judgment used in this work 
is costly, either when it causes waste of ground or when it results in an 
awkward and inconvenient layout. After the plat is recorded and sales are once 
started in the section no changes can be made, hence the maxim to be observed 
is &quot;Make haste slowly and study carefully.&quot;</p> 
<p>The foregoing, as stated in the beginning, applies largely to the laying 
out of lots in cemeteries where the ground is fairly uniform in its character. 
The more broken and diverse the character of the sections, the more will the 
superintendent be compelled to vary from thee plans suggested here. It will be 
found very difficult to sell a lot which lies lower than the adjacent walk or 
drive hence it is evident that where there are depressions in the shape of 
small gullies, walks shall in all cases follow them. Where circular depressions 
exist, in grading the section they will, of course, be filled to a certain 
extent. It is an axiom that no part of a section should be so graded as to 
allow water to stand upon it.</p> 
<p>Of course the superintendent will take advantage of mounds and desirable 
parts of the sections to lay them out in large lots and will be guided by the 
slope of the ground in setting his stakes and in facing his lots. In a general 
way the less desirable parts of the sections will be cut into small lots and 
the more desirable the ground the larger the lot this simply as a plain 
business proposition. The prominent parts at intersections of the drives should 
be laid out into one or several large lots and if the point of the section is 
quite sharp it will be advisable to cut back the lot some little distance and 
use the space so left out for the planting of shrubbery.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>PRICING</p> 
<p>While not coming strictly within the scope of this paper, the pricing of 
lots is intimately connected with it and a few words may be advisable.</p> 
<p>The writer does not believe in pricing lots to the customer by the square 
foot. Separate prices should be fixed for each lot as a whole. These can be 
arrived at by fixing a square foot basis for a certain section or for parts of 
the section, estimating the area and obtaining the price in that way, adding a 
little to the prices of the more desirable lots and perhaps deducting a little 
from the lots which will be less readily saleable. For instance, it will be 
found that lots on the drive or on an elevated part of the section will be sold 
very readily and in order to prevent their being taken up immediately the 
section is placed on sale, a material advance must be made in the price of such 
lots, the general idea being to price each lot according to the sale ability. 
It is our practice to increase the price of the lots bordering on drives about 
10 to 15 percent to add about 10 percent, to corner lots or to lots having a 
walk on two of their sides. In the smaller lots it is also the practice to add 
about 10 percent, to a lot on which a monument is allowed over that on which 
one is not allowed, or if it is not desired to increase the total price of the 
section, an advance of 5 percent could be made on the monument lot and a 
reduction of 5 percent on the lot on which no monument is allowed; That is a 
good proposition in several ways. In the first place it costs more to care for 
a lot with a monument on it than one on which there is no monument. In the 
second place it is well worth while to offer inducements to the small lot owner 
to dispense with a monument.</p> 
<p>The writer is not averse to a reasonable number of monuments of good design 
and material in a cemetery and believes it will be found impossible to prevent 
their use. The monument is with us and with us to stay. The evils of the 
monument are good monuments badly placed; bad monuments, that is, of poor 
material or faulty design, wherever placed, and the crowding of monuments. The 
poor material and the faulty design are found largely in the cheaper class of 
lots and the classes of people who buy these lots have a strong tendency to 
save on the size of the lot and put the money into a monument, thereby 
frequently making the monument just that much more hideous and unsightly.</p> 
<p>I would not be understood as taking the position that a small monument 
cannot be just as attractive and just as artistic as a large one. In theory 
they can be, in practice they are not.</p> 
<p>PLATS</p> 
<p>It is well to adopt a standard scale of all plats. Perhaps the best scale 
for the original plat is one of 20 feet to the inch. Larger than this becomes 
unwieldly and a smaller scale does not allow sufficient space. The original 
plat should be made on a first class quality of cloth backed paper and all 
construction figures should appear thereon. From this a tracing can be made for 
record, and in this connection it should be noted that, in the state of 
Illinois, at least, a severe penalty is provided for those who fail to have a 
plat of each section recorded with the public recorder before making sales. For 
working plats, blue prints, etc., a reduced plat to the scale of 40 feet to the 
inch may be made. A copy of this on tracing cloth with the lines drawn somewhat 
heavier and the numbers and dimension figures also made heavier, may be reduced 
photographically for a zinc etching at a very small expense and this can be 
printed from' very cheaply, thus making it possible to furnish each lot owner 
with a plat of the section in which his lot is, so that he can readily locate 
it without having to take the time of the employees in showing him where it is.

<h2>A System of Administration</h2>  Date Published:&nbsp;  September, 1903  
Original Author:&nbsp;  Frederick Green  Original Publication:&nbsp;  AACS 
Proceedings of the 17th Annual Convention 
<p>Immediately subordinate to a board of trustees or directors there are 
usually found in a cemetery organization, a treasurer, a clerk and a 
superintendent and sometimes an engineer, each directly appointed by and 
responsible to the board.</p> 
<p>The superintendent usually divides his employees into gangs according to 
the nature of the work they are to do. Thus he has a foreman and a gang whose 
duty it is to clean the roads, another to dig graves, a third to cut grass, a 
fourth to put in foundations, etc., the size and number of the gangs depending 
upon the volume of business.</p> 
<p>When one in his first bereavement goes to one of our large cemeteries to 
arrange for the burial of a beloved one, a man called a salesman helps him to 
select a lot, another takes his order for an interment, a third receipts for 
his money, a fourth whom he may never see again lowers his best beloved into 
the grave and later a gang of mowers cuts the grass as often as the 
superintendent thinks necessary and the financial policy of the board permits.
</p> 
<p>A large cemetery so administered seems to lack heart, while the small, 
cemetery where the superintendent comes directly into touch with his lot 
owners, has the advantage of a personality which makes for good and somewhat 
lessens the sharp pangs of death.</p> 
<p>To efficiently administer the affairs of a cemetery it would seem there 
should be a large board of trustees, who should meet about once in six months 
to hear reports and determine the larger questions of policy.</p> 
<p>This board should appoint an executive committee of say five members, who 
should meet as often as once each month. The executive committee should select 
an executive officer who would be responsible for all the duties usually 
devolving upon: the clerk, treasurer, superintendent and engineer. This 
executive officer, by whatever title known, should hire and discharge directly 
or indirectly, all employees of the association and his word should go in the 
office or on the grounds.</p> 
<p>As far as practical the men on the grounds should be worked not in gangs 
but as individuals. For instance a man should be given a part of the cemetery, 
say a section and it should be his business to cut the grass, water and care 
for the flowers, clean the roadways, and at the same time to check any unseemly 
conduct on the part of visitors. He should know the location of each lot on his 
section and it should be his duty to render any little assistance in his power 
to any of the lot owners on his section. In short it should be his business to 
know his lot owners and to be a favorite with them.</p> 
<p>A number of contiguous sections should constitute a division and of course 
the number of divisions would depend upon the size of the cemetery. Each 
division should be placed in charge of a foreman, or perhaps a better name 
would be &quot;Division Superintendent.&quot; He should with the approval of 
the executive officer hire and discharge the section men and instruct them in 
the performance of their duties, and keep their time. He should attend all 
funerals on his division, and be responsible for the neat appearance of the 
opened grave, the orderly conducting of the funerals, the closing of the grave, 
the placing of the cut flowers after the interment and the removal from the lot 
of all material used at the burial. He could of course call upon the section 
man to help him and in this way both he and the section man would be enabled to 
remember without effort the names and locations of the more recent interments 
and afterwards to readily respond to inquiries from friends or relatives.</p> 
<p>A book of rules definitely defining the individual and general duties of 
each employee would be a great aid in promoting a feeling of individual 
responsibility for the general welfare of the whole cemetery.</p> 
<p>In Lake View good discipline is largely enforced by a committee of the 
employees originally selected by them.</p> 
<p>Complaints of lot owners are referred to this committee and report is made 
to the next monthly meeting of the employees and if anyone has been at fault 
the committee states the case and announces the assessment of a small fine, 
which is paid into the employees' sick benefit fund.</p> 
<p>It is also the imperative duty of certain employees and it is the privilege 
of all, to report to the committee any mishap, delay or other circumstances 
that may appear to be detrimental to the welfare of the cemetery.</p> 
<p>The fundamental idea upon which we are working in Lake View is to develop 
individualism as opposed to gangism in the management of employees, resulting 
in a federation of small cemeteries, thus adding the good points of the small 
organization to the numerous advantages possessed by a large enterprise.</p>

<h2>Organization</h2>  Date Published:&nbsp;  September, 1903  Original 
Author:&nbsp;  L. B. Root  Original Publication:&nbsp;  AACS Proceedings of the 
17th Annual Convention 
<p>Since my arrival here in the effete East, I have been subjected to a good 
many good natured serio-comic remarks about the subject I have chosen for my 
paper. In self-defense I have decided to inflict upon you a preliminary chapter.
<br> &nbsp;<br>
 One gentleman said to me: &quot;I suppose when you wanted to 
organize a cemetery out West, you just killed somebody, or turned loose the 
James or Younger boys, or a tribe of Apaches, or a Kansas cyclone, or a band of 
cowboys and the cemetery started itself.&quot;</p> 
<p>Now this is not true, if it ever was. Everybody who dies out our way now 
must have a regular certificate, and the causes of death appearing thereon read 
very much like yours, I presume. The tomahawk, bowie knife and six-shooter no 
longer appear. Ante-mortem conditions have changed. Instead of the bandit, the 
cowboy and the Apache, we have the doctor, the lawyer and the preacher and the 
over-sympathetic old neighbor, whose husband died the very same way. The 
bacillus finds more victims than the bad man from Bitter Creek; the merry 
microbe succeeds the mirthful cowboy; the greedy germ and numerous other 
microorganisms frequently get on the warpath and cause more trouble than 
Geronimo's braves; many people lose their vermiform appendix, but none their 
scalp lock. Christian Scientists treat more patients than the Indian medicine 
man. However, I am without data to enable me to give comparative results.<br>
 
&nbsp;<br>
 Another gentleman from way down East, gravely informed me that 
beyond the Mississippi, in that part of the country which, I presume, is still 
marked on their geographies as the Great American Desert, it is only good form 
for people to die with their boots on and rely upon the coyotes, jackals and 
turkey buzzards for final arrangements. This is another mis&not;take. 
Post-mortem names and conditions have also changed. Instead of the aforesaid, 
we, like you, have the undertaker and the hack-man, the lawyer and the 
preacher, the florist and the monument man, the sexton and the cemetery 
superintendent, the administrator and the surrogate or probate judge. And they 
all get theirs.</p> 
<p>About the only advantage there is in dying out West, is that after these 
are all done and there is anything left of the estate.&nbsp; New York State 
does.</p> 
<p>The West is surely behind on facilities for cremation. The nearest 
crematory to the Great American Desert is at St. Louis, making it 
neces&not;sary for the few advocates of that method for the disposal of the 
dead, to travel long distances sometimes.</p> 
<p>Not long since, a disconsolate widow from Topeka was returning from St. 
Louis with the ashes of her deceased fourth husband in an urn, as a part of her 
hand baggage. She had for a neighboring passenger a maiden lady from either 
Boston or Rochester; I do not just remember which. The Eastern lady, noticing 
the evident distress of the Topeka widow, sought to comfort her, and inquired 
the cause of her sorrow. Upon being told, she became quite agitated and 
exclaimed that here she had lived sixty-five years without any husband, while 
this woman had husbands to burn.</p> 
<p>Nature provides wondrous and devious ways to regulate and control the 
population and depopulation of the earth and the Indian, the cowboy and the 
bandit were but cogs in the wonderful mechanism of nature's regu&not;lator.</p> 
<p>Death may be more important to the world than life. Wars may be blessings. 
Pestilence and famine may make for good. An epidemic of breakfast foods may not 
be an unmixed evil. The automobile may be doing its deadly work in the interest 
of humanity. Fire and flood, Fourth of July and football may all be elements in 
nature's great economy, to provide room for generations yet unborn. Let us 
prove it by a mathematical demonstration.</p> 
<p>Rural New York claims the best high schools and academies and col&not;leges 
in the world. It was in one of these, not far from Rochester, that I learned to 
figure and almost learned to believe figures will not lie. We shudder at the 
loss of life during Caesar's wars, which occurred about 2,000 years ago, or 
sixty generations of 33 &#8531; years each. Let us suppose that two more people 
had escaped death in these wars, and that the ratio of increase for these two 
was 1&frac12; per generation of 33 &#8531; years each, which does not seem 
unreasonable, even in these days when we hear so much strenuous talk about race 
suicide. A simple mathematical formula, worked out on the basis of these 
figures, shows that the increase from this pair would have added to the 
population of the earth at the present time, 73,560,000,000 souls. This would 
make it somewhat crowded for us, and we may have abundant reason to thank 
Caesar that no more of them got away.</p> 
<p>So the calamities of our generation become the blessings for those yet to 
come. It is safe to assume that nature's laws will continue to operate to keep 
the ratio of increase of population within proper limits, and the cemetery may 
be regarded as a permanent institution, and should be or&not;ganized 
accordingly.</p> 
<p>The question of cemetery organization seems to be important, yet we hardly 
ever hear it discussed in detail among cemetery people, so I have chosen this 
subject, knowing that I will be expected to say but little about it. In fact I 
do not dare to say much, for I might give some detail away and some 
superintendent might be led, in the heat of discussion, to tell something of 
which his governing board might not approve.</p> 
<p>The organizing of a cemetery now is a different proposition from that of 
100 or even 50 years ago. One hundred years ago only about 3 percent of our 
population lived in cities; 97 percent was rural. The burial of the dead had 
naught to do with business. Sympathizing hands prepared the body for burial; 
one kindly neighbor made the coffin, another dug the grave, the best vehicle in 
the community carried the remains to the church yard, where free interment was 
made. The grave was marked and cared for by kindred people, until finally lost 
in the blissful oblivion of weeds and forgetfulness. In all this there was no 
thought of pay or gain. Now 40 percent of our population is urban, most of the 
rest is suburban.</p> 
<p>Under present conditions, when death occurs, friends and acquaint&not;ances 
ride in the carriages, offer advice, sympathy and flowers, but seldom anything 
else. The disposal of the dead has become a business proposition. Most 
undertakers make a modest charge for their services. In fact, I believe they 
are made safe in most states by being made preferred cred&not;itors. The 
minister who officiates wears, at the proper time, an expectant look above his 
clerical necktie. The liveryman usually renders a good sized bill and his 
drivers belong to the union. The florist expects more profits from funerals 
than weddings. There are more of them. It takes two to make a wedding, one only 
to make a funeral and besides some do escape matrimony. While I am decidedly 
averse to saying anything about our good friend, the doctor, candor compels me 
to admit that he looks you up in Bradstreet and makes his charge for what he 
thinks you or your estate can stand then adds a percentage as a factor of 
safety. The lawyer who breaks the will is usually satisfied with one-half of 
the estate, if it is quite large. A lawyer out our way, after lying a long time 
at the point of death, finally died. His trusting wife placed upon his memorial 
the inscription: &quot;A lawyer and an honest man.&quot; One of our old 
plantation darkies, noticing this, remarked with evident surprise, &quot;I 
wonder how they came to bury two people in one grave.&quot; The price the 
monument man names indicates that he never expects to get another opportunity, 
and wishes to make the most of this one; and so all along the line, until we 
come to the cemetery, we find everything connected with mortuary affairs 
organized on a basis of financial profit. But we find cemeteries organized in 
divers and wonderful ways. We have them on the basis of poverty, politics, 
patriotism and pri&not;vate greed, charity, church, city and corporation, lot 
owners mutual; some mutually strong, others mutually weak. Nothing seems to be 
settled; no particular plan seems to be accepted as best. All are subject to 
more or less criticism.</p> 
<p>The ownership and operation of large cemeteries by churches has been 
practically abandoned, except by the Catholic Church. No other one 
de&not;nomination having the compact membership, the perfect discipline and 
splendid organization to successfully handle larger cemetery propositions.</p> 
<p>Cities can and do own and operate cemetery properties. Municipal ownership 
offers some advantage. The city's credit can be used to secure the money to 
purchase the necessary ground and provide for initial im&not;provements. The 
general fund is handy to make up any deficit that may occur. Too often, 
however, the city cemetery receives either too much or too little attention 
from the city authorities. Mayors and aldermen are looking for patronage, and 
some of them do not hesitate to prostitute the highly honorable positions of 
superintendent or sexton, and others, to po&not;litical purposes.</p> 
<p>I heard of a case down east somewhere, where a large number of men were 
needed in the city cemetery just before a close election, but were not needed 
long after and the dominant party was accused of voting them all, besides a 
good many names from the memorials.</p> 
<p>At best, public sentiment is apt to be fluctuating and spasmodic, and the 
cemetery suffers in consequence. In any case, while many of the older city 
burial grounds are very well conducted and cared for, very few, if any, cities 
are establishing new ones.</p> 
<p>Probably one half of the cemeteries in the United States are conducted by 
an organization or reorganization of lot owners. The governing boards consist 
of a number of good natured old gentlemen who have no financial interest in the 
proposition, but who are benevolently inclined enough to be willing to help by 
having their names printed on the list of trustees, but can seldom be gotten 
together to attend to the cemetery's business. Not getting anything out of it 
themselves, they sometimes fail to grasp the mag&not;nitude of the financial 
proposition they are called upon to administer. I have heard some 
superintendents complain that they expected to have a $1,000,000 proposition 
handled by a $1,000 superintendent.</p> 
<p>The elasticity of the organization of lot owners' cemeteries has in most 
instances enabled them to reorganize on broader business and financial lines to 
meet modern requirements.</p> 
<p>A large majority of the larger cemeteries started in the last fifteen years 
have been organized as some form of private corporation. Some of these have 
been organized, as commercial propositions pure and simple; others, as a matter 
of public necessity, by public-spirited citizens, who in&not;corporate, in 
order to more properly finance and more perfectly secure and maintain the 
interests of a large public enterprise. This method of organi&not;zation seems 
to be more a matter of necessity than choice. Large cities are not establishing 
new burial places.</p> 
<p>The modern cemetery requires too large an initial expenditure for a lot 
owners' organization. The cemetery is, as we have seen, more and more of a 
business proposition, Hence, modern methods of business and finance must be 
applied to it. Some people object, for sentimental or superstitious reasons, to 
cemetery investments. I knew one man who said he was willing to take money won 
at poker, bet on a horse, race, or gained by speculating in wheat, but he'd be 
hanged if he wanted any made by a cemetery investment. His trouble was more 
superstition than an over-heated conscience.</p> 
<p>The first cemetery of which we have any account in holy writ was strictly a 
commercial proposition. Sarah, the wife of Abraham, had died in Hebron. Abraham 
demanded of the sons of Heth possession of a burying place with them. They 
offered him a choice of all their sepulchers without charge. But Abraham, with 
laudable pride, wanted a burial place of his own, and proposed to pay for it. 
He wanted the cave of Machpelah, which was in a field owned by Ephron, the 
Hittite, and he said to Ephron, &quot;I will give thee money for the field, 
take it of me and I will bury my dead there.&quot; And after some further 
parley .about price, &quot;Abraham weighed upon Ephron 400 pieces of silver, 
current money with the merchant, and the field of Ephron and the cave which was 
thereon, and all the trees that were in the field, that were in the borders 
round about, were made sure unto Abraham for a burying place by the sons of 
Heth.&quot;</p> 
<p>The modern cemetery for the use of a large or rapidly growing city is a 
larger business and financial problem than the field of Ephron.</p> 
<p>It should have ample grounds, say from 200 to 500 acres, not too near the 
city, but easily accessible by modern means of transportation. It should be 
large for several reasons, First, to meet requirements for 100 years; second, 
to provide plenty of room for park spaces, ornamental planting and like 
Abraham&rsquo;s burying place, &quot;to have trees in the borders round 
about&quot;; third, to protect itself from new competition; fourth, to provide 
a large and permanent endowment fund for perpetual care, after sales of ground 
have ceased; fifth, to protect itself from condemnation, in consequence of the 
rapid increase of urban population.</p> 
<p>Small cemeteries are constantly in danger, in or near large cities. And 
above all, perhaps, it should be large so that a policy to prevent 
overcrowd&not;ing may be adopted and no danger from a sanitary standpoint may 
ever present itself. The evils and scandals arising from small and overcrowded 
burial places became so intolerable in the large cities of Great Britain, that 
in 1855, an act was passed by Parliament closing them all, with but few 
exceptions.</p> 
<p>Burial within the limits of cities and towns is now almost everywhere 
abolished and at a very, large expenditure of money London and most of the 
chief provincial towns have outside cemeteries, which are under the supervision 
of local burial boards and of inspectors appointed by the government.</p> 
<p>France has gone through the same experience. In consequence of the 
cemeteries of Paris being more or less crowded, a great cemetery with an area 
of over two square miles was laid out in 1874, sixteen miles north of Paris. 
Every city and town in France is required by law to provide a burial ground 
outside of its limits, properly laid out and planted, and in which each 
interment must be made in a separate grave. This last re&not;quirement is not 
always followed in this country, where land is plentiful.</p> 
<p>The large grounds being secured, they must have extensive initial 
im&not;provements. While all of the property is not to be improved at once, yet 
a careful expert study should be made of the property as a whole, and a general 
plan for systematic and complete development must be outlined. A system of 
roads must be constructed; a system of drainage must be es&not;tablished; a 
water system must be provided; perfect grading, shaping, sur&not;facing, 
sodding and seeding of grounds enough for twenty-five years must be completed; 
an intelligent and extensive scheme of planting must be started, and a nursery 
should be planted for raising hardy ornamental shrubs and trees. Greenhouses-- 
but better wait awhile until you have to have them. Elaborate entrance or 
entrances must be provided; chapel and receiving vault must be built; a number 
of other buildings must be erected, such as suburban railroad station, 
administration buildings such as office, stables and tool houses, 
superintendent's residence, sexton's house, gate keepers' lodges, etc. 
Oftentimes local conditions require the construction of bridges, culverts and 
artificial lakes and waterways. Modern conditions seem to tend more and more 
toward forcing the cemetery to enter into competition with itself and establish 
a cemetery.</p> 
<p>These grounds and improvements have to be perpetually maintained and cared 
for, an expense still greater than and just as important as the cost of initial 
improvements.</p> 
<p>This must be provided for in the original financial organization. Bearing 
in the mind the idea of perpetual care and the fact that a cem&not;etery 
proposition is a permanent investment, all the work referred to must be of the 
very best permanent character. The buildings, entrances, bridges and culverts 
must be of stone; the roadways of the very best macadam; the drainage system, 
including gutters, intakes and discharge pipes, must be of ample size and of 
the best material and workmanship and so on with all the improvements.</p> 
<p>The purchase of this ground and the making of these improvements require a 
large initial expenditure, which, in order to secure the per&not;manency of the 
burial place should not rest as a debt upon the ground.</p> 
<p>To do all this you must have the help of the almighty dollar. Talk is 
cheap, but if you do things of this sort, they would tell you out West 
&quot;You've got to have the stuff.&quot;</p> 
<p>Three hundred acres of ground located, as I have indicated, would cost in 
the neighborhood of $250,000 ;$250,000 more would not make very elab&not;orate 
improvements for a complete cemetery proposition when compared with older 
cemeteries, making a total of half a million dollars. Allowing 20 percent of 
the ground for roadways, parking, etc., the remaining 240 acres at an average 
of $1 a square foot would come to over $10,000,000. We have then, at the 
outset, a financial proposition of considerable magnitude, even in these days. 
It should be approached as such, and be properly financed along business lines. 
How shall it be done?</p> 
<p>As I said in the beginning, I knew I would not be expected to say very much 
about cemetery organization, but I may venture to call atten&not;tion to 
several facts in connection with it, which you already know. To summarize:</p> 
<p>The nation, with the exception of a few patriotic cemeteries which it owns 
and splendidly maintains, pays no attention to cemeteries, or their regulation. 
Under our form of government, the cemetery would be con&not;sidered a local 
matter and be left for the jurisdiction of the several states, but the states 
as a rule have no cemeteries and in many cases exercise very little control 
over them. Cities are quitting the business, and by condemnation for sanitary 
or other reasons, are causing others to quit. One church only, or possibly two 
still control cemetery affairs.</p> 
<p>The lot owners' organization does not seem to be compact and power&not;ful 
enough to project large, new, modern burial places. Private, individ&not;ual 
ownership does not insure perpetuity and seems gruesome and out of place.</p> 
<p>With the rapid growth of city population, a great many large burial places 
will be needed in the future. The present time seems to mark an epoch in 
cemetery history. Present conditions are forcing a public utility of the first 
importance into the hands of private corporations or stock companies. And this 
is being done without any adequate provision for the protection of public 
interests.</p> 
<p>The citizen has as good a right to demand of the state, protection for his 
cemetery interests, as for his banking interests. We all have business with the 
cemetery. Just a few of us have much with the banks. If cemeteries must be 
conducted by private corporations, it seems just that the state should, by 
proper legislation, see to it that in the organization and operation of 
cemeteries, the interests of the public are protected. The public has a 
rightful interest, for instance, in the perpetuity of the ceme&not;tery, and 
general legislation to secure that protection is desirable. Laws might be 
enacted, fixing the minimum size of burial grounds for cities of different 
classes, regulating location well without city limits, and pro&not;viding that 
the grounds shall be entirely dedicated free from debt to ceme&not;tery uses 
forever and that no encumbrance can ever be placed upon any portion of the 
ground. A larger degree of protection from condemnation should be provided. The 
proceeds from the sale of ground must provide for current maintenance, 
perpetual care and interest on and payment of original investment. The public 
then has an interest in this entire fund, and an equitable distribution of it 
to secure each of those results should be provided for by law. The matter of 
records is a proper subject for state inspection and control. It is a 
lamentable fact that in many of our larger and well kept cemeteries, the 
earliest records are foggy or uncer&not;tain, and in some instances, lost 
entirely. A complete system of surveys, platting, duplicate or triplicate 
interment records and plat books kept at different places, should be made 
compulsory.</p> 
<p>That the force of public opinion may be allowed to act for the 
pro&not;tection and benefit of the cemetery at all times, the utmost publicity 
as to financial matters should be provided for. Some of the states have 
abso&not;lutely no legislation upon any of these and other important points 
which should be outlined in the original organization of cemetery corporations.
</p> 
<p>It seems to me that this association might be able to accomplish great good 
by the appointment of a committee on legislation, to investigate present laws, 
study legislative requirements and make a report showing legislation needed, if 
any. The association could then throw the weight of its growing influence in 
the direction of public good. If this can be done, I will gladly refer the 
whole subject matter to such committee for consideration and shift the burden 
of any more of this paper from your shoulders to theirs.</p>

<h2>Cemetery Engineering</h2>  Date Published:&nbsp;  August, 1927  Original 
Author:&nbsp;  H. H. Hawkins  Original Publication:&nbsp;  AACS Proceedings of 
the 41st Annual Convention 
<p>Various kinds of work performed in the large cemeteries of today have come 
about by a sort of an evolutionary process.</p> 
<p>There was a time when the first church graveyard or the township plots with 
its ten by ten lots were probably aligned by the eye or chord line, and the 
sexton or near by neighbor could tell from memory all buried therein.</p> 
<p>Today it is somewhat different. The lots are designed to fit the contour of 
the ground and the landscape effects should be most pleasing to the eye. After 
all it is the living we must please, and a visitor may be so attracted to a 
certain spot that often times leads up to the sale of the lot in advance of the 
need.</p> 
<p>As I am assuming that all of us here are connected with cemeteries already 
established, and instead of dealing with an entire new proposition I shall 
devote my time more to the designing of a new section or that phase of the work.
</p> 
<p>Cemeteries of any importance should have in their possession a 
topographical map showing the contours, and the proposed roads, water mains, 
sewers, etc.</p> 
<p>Before constructing a new section it is advisable to first build the road 
way around it, or at least bring the road to such a point that will be 
accessible to the section.</p> 
<p>There should, be a great deal of consideration given to the roadways as 
they are a very important factor in the cemetery, the grades and curves should 
be well worked out. Catch basins should be set at certain intervals depending 
upon the width, grade, and slope if any on the section. Very steep grades are 
unbecoming as well as dangerous, and I would say that grades above seven per 
cent should be avoided and if at all possible hold down to five percent. All 
drives or roads on a curve in a cemetery boulevard, or elsewhere should be 
built with a super-elevation, i. e; the outside of the curve should be higher 
than the inside. This not only makes driving safer but saves the roads as well 
and will not mar the landscape when properly constructed.</p> 
<p>I would like to digress here a moment and call your attention to some of 
our roads at Lake View Cemetery. We have between six and seven miles of macadam 
roads; as they were built a great many years ago the surface has been worn off 
in a great many places. During the past month or two we have tried out a few 
new schemes&mdash;on one stretch of about 1500 feet in length we have 
resurfaced with a material called Kentucky Rock, or some call it Kirock for 
short.&nbsp; On another stretch of about the same length we have resurfaced 
this with a material known as Amacite.</p> 
<p>On your trip tomorrow afternoon these two roads are near the Garfield 
Memorial, and we will be very glad to go into details of the laying of this 
material and any information that you care to have along that line.</p> 
<p>If we are to have good landscape sections then there must be good roads to 
produce a harmonious effect which would be pleasing to the eye as one rides 
along the curved drives leading to or by lakes, ravines, or things of interest.
</p> 
<p>In designing sections, a great deal of thought should be given to this part 
of the work&mdash;long before a section is needed it should go through the 
mental stage of construction, even in this stage it may often be torn down and 
rebuilt. It would be advisable to visit the proposed plat of ground 
occasionally, and each time approach it from a different angle. Sometimes it 
may be well to do some free hand sketching. In doing this one will 
unconsciously acquire a mental photo of the future section.</p> 
<p>After this is well established in one's mind, all trees or anything else 
that might hinder in the plan of burials should be accurately located. This 
will aid greatly in the designing of lots and should be platted accordingly. 
Nature has provided our land well with trees. In this part or the country our 
cemeteries contain many such specimens as the Oak, Maple, .Elm, etc., 
occasionally in undeveloped parts there maybe a large space that has no trees. 
In places such as this and others, a&nbsp; few of the ornamental type might be 
considered, such as the Ginkgo, Pin Oak, Taxodium, Oriental Plane, or something 
on the order of the Purple or Copper Beech for color effect. There are many 
places where these types would be fitting and would not only be in contrast to 
the general shade type of tree, but would give an artistic effect to the 
section as well.</p> 
<p>Before allotting a section a study should be made of its location as to its 
surroundings, etc. If one of the remote sections laying somewhere along the 
border tine it may be better suited for single grave allotments or a part of it 
for two or three grave lots. If on the other hand it should be the select part 
of the cemetery which would bring the highest price, an entirely different 
scheme should be worked out.</p> 
<p>It would not be advisable to adhere to hard set rules in platting a section 
as one plan may require an entirely different scheme from another based on its 
location, and the contour of the ground. Each one must be a study of itself. In 
all events there should be a three root reserve strip on the border of the 
section. In this strip the water mains can be laid, and is a much better place 
than in the roadways, In case of a leak a repair can be made and the road will 
not have to be dug up or traffic interfered with. There may be occasions to lay 
telephone or electric cables an which this strip again becomes useful.</p> 
<p>In the average section the first tier of lots back of the reserve strip may 
be ten or twelve feet in depth then followed by nine foot tiers with a three 
foot walk.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>It should be kept in mind that in platting the lots to provide for walks in 
which water lines can be run in which any lot can be reached with a hose on a 
fifty foot radius, and if it can be so arranged there should be only one drip 
for the entire section at the lowest .point. There should be a three inch drain 
in the same trench with the water pipe to take care of the waste water from the 
hose connections and goose necks where lot owners may have access to the water.
</p> 
<p>Monument lots should vary in size as well as the small lots which do not 
permit monuments. These lots should be kept back from driveways as much as 
possible to be in keeping with the park plan scheme. It gives the monuments 
more of an individual setting where planting can be used for a background which 
not only adds to the beauty of the monument but enhances the general landscape 
as well. Some have gone so far in cemetery designing to suggest that all stone 
work be eliminated to make it a beautiful park. I think this is overstepping 
the line somewhat, and is contrary to a deep rooted sentiment of a long time 
custom to mark the last resting place of those who have gone before. There will 
be parks, and there will be cemeteries, but let there still be a distinction 
between the two.</p> 
<p>The distance from the road to the farthest lot in which pall bearers would 
be expected to carry should be given consideration. Probably 150 feet would be 
a maximum distance. Often times in a very large section it is advisable to run 
an eight foot service drive through the center in which funerals would have 
better access to the lot. This would also give better service to the gardener 
and grave digger in the handling of materials to and from the main drive.</p> 
<p>A word or two about drainage may not be out of place. No one wants to bury 
their loved ones in a wet grave. A section or part or a section that would be 
inclined to be wet should be drained. This should be done during the course of 
construction after the rough grading has been done. When the allotting plan has 
been decided upon, the drains should be so arranged that they will pass through 
the lots where needed. It is also well to use plenty of cinders to insure 
better drainage.</p> 
<p>The modern cemetery or course must have cornerstones with numbers upon them 
indicating upon the ground the boundary or lots. This is not only essential, 
but a great help to the salesman, lot owner, or employees in locating the lot. 
All corner stones should be furnished by the cemetery, and placed in the ground 
before the section is opened for sale.</p> 
<p>The section or sales map should have all the data noted thereon as to the 
prices and sizes or all lots, as well as restrictions or whatever nature 
regarding the section. All details regarding the condition of sale, rules, 
etc., should be thoroughly explained to the new-coming lot owner, so that there 
may be no misunderstandings or hard feelings later on.</p> 
<p>The selling of burial lots is nothing new; we might go back to Gen. 23: 
15-20, where it tells us that &quot;Abraham buried Sarah his wife who was 127 
years old, and paid Ephram 400 shekels of silver for the cave in which to bury 
Sarah.&quot; Here we have the first purchase of land and a record of burial. It 
is very essential to keep an accurate record not only of the burials but all 
permanent fixtures that go into the ground, as well as on top, because sooner 
or later information may be wanted by the lot owner regarding past burials. 
Future improvements maybe made from time to time in which connections must be 
made to water mains, sewers, etc., which have been recorded in the past. A card 
index system giving the lot owner's name as well as those that have, been 
buried on the various lots is a very essential record to keep. From this it is 
quite convenient to answer the many quarters from the lot owners as to the 
location of their relatives and friends and often times their own lots. The 
various cemeteries seem to have their own system of keeping record of location 
of burials, headstones, etc. Some use the lot diagram book, and some the card 
system. A few of the larger cemeteries however, record this information as well 
as other, upon large sheets drawn to a scale. These sheets represent a plat of 
ground 150 ft. x 200 ft. Lots when platted upon these sheets not only show the 
adjoining lots but show all those near by, and have been found very useful in 
an explanatory sense, especially when arranging for burial with a lot owner who 
is not very familiar with his lot. As stated before, all permanent fixtures are 
recorded on these sheets, and with the proper index it is very convenient to 
locate anything, and the whole territory in question can be seen at a. glance. 
At the intersection of the base lines which represent this block, a permanent 
monument can be placed upon which is a number, corresponding to the number of 
the block. A map or record of elevation upon the various monuments will be 
found quite useful from time to time, especially when working up new territory.
</p> 
<p>There have been several schemes suggested and tried along the lines of 
advertising cemetery lots. Newspaper ads etc., may be all right to introduce a 
new proposition, but an established cemetery upon a running basis can do no 
better than interest people by its attractive landscape and good service, 
worked out from a well studied plan.</p> 
<p>In many of the cemeteries a lot holder is considered a member of the 
association or corporation. In this way they take a greater interest in more 
ways than one, and will undoubtedly be a booster in their community to get 
their friends to join with them in the self same interest.</p> 
<p>Gladstone, England's great statesman; who measured people by their 
cemeteries once said, &quot;Show me the manner in which a nation or community 
cares for its dead, and I will measure with mathematical exactness the tender 
sympathies of its people, their respect for the laws of the land, and their 
loyalty to high ideals.&quot;</p> 
<p>In conclusion it might be said that &quot;cemetery engineering&rdquo; after 
all, involves more than the use of transit and chain, as they only play a small 
part, yet are very useful when the proper time comes for their use in 
development work, whether it be new sections, roadways, buildings of various 
kinds, etc. These problems as well as many others require a great deal of 
methodical deliberation in studying out the various suggestions that come up. 
It has been said that work well planned is 51% complete, therefore it is 
absolutely essential that plans be prepared, and be given very careful 
consideration that later on when fully executed, they will show forth the idea 
finished in reality, which will be admired by those of like minds, as well as 
those of the community, and visitors as well, and will prove that time and 
money have been well spent.</p>

<h2>Sources of Income Open to a Cemetery</h2>  Date Published:&nbsp;  August, 
1925  Original Author:&nbsp;  Charles W. M. Fitz  West Laurel Hill Cemetery, 
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania  Original Publication:&nbsp;  AACS Proceedings of 
the 39th Annual Convention 
<p>There are in the United States two monthly Magazines SYSTEM and MOTOR 
devoted to business and each month they both have articles by business men on 
the methods of accounting and methods they have found successful in obtaining 
custom. There is also in each Magazine a red hot story of a successful strategy 
whereby some large contract was obtained or a good customer recovered by the 
head of the firm who showed the boys how to do or a story by the cub salesman 
who thought it all out by himself: Oh! The story is beautiful and the method of 
obtaining customers succeeds so well, but THEY DON'T WORK FOR ME! And so I may 
present to you sources of income which succeeds so well at my Cemetery but may 
be of no use to you.</p> 
<p>In displaying to you the sources of income that appear to me open to a 
Cemetery I expect only to speak of those which relate to the operation of a 
Cemetery and do not include ordinary farming or market garden operations for at 
West Laurel Hill Cemetery there are no sources of income which are not directly 
applicable to any Cemetery. West Laurel Hill Cemetery Greenhouse sells nothing 
outside the Cemetery. Anyone can run a Greenhouse; anyone can be a merchant for 
anything and a Cemetery can grow and market potatoes or spinach or any farm 
product&mdash;it can hire its gardeners out to care for private places as West 
Laurel Hill Cemetery has often been solicited by its lot holders to do (but 
never has allowed) but all of these sources of income are outside the scope of 
this article, as they are open to anyone&mdash;but legitimate sources of income 
for a Cemetery are those open only to a Cemetery.</p> 
<p>The sources of income open to a Cemetery as I see it may be put under 
twelve heads and several sub-heads:<br>
 First-Courtesy <br>
 Second-Persistent 
Advertising<br>
 Third-Psychological Salesmanship<br>
 Fourth-General Good 
condition of Cemetery<br>
 Fifth-Sales of Burial Rights <br>
 (Lot sales)<br>
 
(Single Graves)<br>
 (Community Mausoleums<br>
 (Crematory &amp; Columbarium) 
<br> Sixth-Inculcation of the idea that the Cemetery in which is his lot is HIS 
Cemetery rather than the Cemetery of the selling Company.<br>
 
Seventh-Institution (and addition to it from each sale) of a fund the income 
from which shall maintain the Cemetery.<br>
 Eighth-The institution and 
inculcation of individual ENDOWMENT of the individual lot holders own lot:<br>
 
Ninth-Burial Charges<br>
 Receiving Tomb Charges <br>
 Rental of Special 
Mausoleums instead of use of Receiving Tomb<br>
 Charges for digging graves and 
usual attention at a funeral<br>
 Charges for special grave structures <br>
 
Charges for grave and dirt pile decoration and use of tents, etc.<br>
 Removal 
charges from grave to grave or as ordered.<br>
 Tenth-Income from construction 
of foundations and work connected therewith, as corner post holes and derrick 
guy line posts.<br>
 E1eventh-Greenhouse work <br>
 Bouquets, cut flowers and 
floral designs<br>
 Christmas designs and decorations <br>
 Faster and Memorial 
Day floral requirements<br>
 Flowerbeds <br>
 Planting Graves <br>
 Sodding and 
grading<br>
 Special trees &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
 Special yearly care of lots 
and<br>
 Talking up endowments: <br>
 Twelfth-Endowments </p> 
<p>In presenting to you after twenty-seven years of Cemetery work the sources 
of income that appear to me open to a Cemetery, I expect only to speak of those 
which relate to a Cemetery and do not touch the farming operations which may be 
proper for the outlying or undeveloped parts.</p> 
<p>First. Courtesy-I put courtesy and a spirit of interest in everyone coming 
to the Cemetery as one of the best sources of income a Cemetery can 
have&mdash;in the early days of West Laurel Hill Cemetery.</p> 
<p>Yes! In the very early days when West Laurel Hill Cemetery was so far from 
the haunts of men that anyone could be excused for saying &ldquo;Where is it 
at? I mean in the years 1869 to 1876. The Secretary at the City Office was a 
man who was courtesy itself; Listen to you, hear all about your life and 
remember it!! and yet he was always putting the Cemetery where the talker 
remembered it&mdash;Did his hours spent with aunt Jane and cousin Mary pay? 
Yes. They paid. By courtesy I do not mean an outward overflow of hand shaking 
and what I may call palaver, but that indescribable something which bespeaks 
interest in you. No matter if it is a child&mdash;no matter if it, is the 
poorest owner of a single grave&mdash;the child or the poorest owner of a 
single grave may have the word to say to some wealthy person &quot;Go to West 
Laurel Hill Cemetery.&quot; Yes!! I see you say that is a low reason for 
courtesy-true!! But you want to see behind the scenes and I am showing you. I 
know whereof I speak&mdash;indeed, I have known of people once poor to become 
rich and the warmth of the courtesy shown them when poor made them a client, 
ah! That's a word!! Made them a client when rich.</p> 
<p>Second. Persistent Advertising. Where&mdash;When&mdash;How. At West Laurel 
Hill persistent advertising through the last forty years has been by a two or 
three line ad in one or two daily newspapers and by a small pamphlet scattered 
broadcast over the city from the City Directory by mail&mdash;it pays&mdash;in 
one particular case the lady who bought a $500.00 lot told us she had thrown 
our pamphlet in the ash barrel and then, the next day, fished it out again. 
Again, and most important of all, West Laurel Hill Cemetery advertises by the 
persistent bombardment three times a year of lot holders and all whose names 
and addresses it is possible to obtain connected with lot holders; you come to 
our office and ask to see the lot or grave of John Smith&mdash;at once or as 
opportunity offers we get your name and address and relationship to John Smith 
and send you advertising matter three times a year.</p> 
<p>Third. Physiological Salesmanship: What is it-Well! It is just the reverse 
of the psychological purchase of a horse. When you are psychologically 
purchasing a horse, you can see more defects in that horse than you can find 
after you purchase him&mdash;when you sell physiologically, you are weighing 
every point of the customer for that inkling of how high he will go&mdash;It is 
not his clothes; it is not the paint on his auto&mdash;it may be a 
sigh&mdash;it may be a hesitation as you walk by a lot&mdash;it is feeling the 
pulse of the prospect and at last perhaps shooting far ahead of his supposed 
mark so as to back gracefully down&mdash;it is saying&mdash;this lot is 
$15,000.00 dollars and noting an indescribable delay&mdash;perhaps be says to 
his wife&mdash;&quot;How will that suit you Mother&quot;!! The tone is 
enough&mdash;after that if you look at another lot you say, &quot;It is not as 
good as your lot&quot; clearly meaning the $15,000.00 lot. What is 
Psychological Salesmanship&mdash;it is so hard to tell&mdash;I give it up. You 
can cultivate it and never know you have it.</p> 
<p>Fourth. General Good Condition of Roads and Lawns: Of course the appearance 
of the Cemetery will influence the prosperity of the Cemetery but there is 
often a neatness and evidence of care although all the grass may not be cut to 
hand mower shortness and the condition of roads and edging may vary in 
accordance with the locality; but neatness and evident care of the Cemetery are 
a source of income.</p> 
<p>Fifth. Sales of Burial Rights. <br>
 Lot Sales <br>
 Single Graves <br>
 
Community Mausoleum<br>
 Crematory and Columbarium </p> 
<p>In most cemeteries the greater part of revenue from Lot Sales and in some 
communities the income from Single Graves is a source worthy of consideration 
but in Philadelphia I know of no Cemetery where it is worth considering and in 
my own Cemetery, West Laurel Hill, only 387 single graves have been disposed of 
in forty-eight years.</p> 
<p>In regard to income from Community Mausoleums, Crematory and Columbarium, I 
am not in a position to speak as my own Cemetery has none and there is only one 
small community Mausoleum in or near Philadelphia and only one small Crematory 
and Columbarium which are under a society rather than in connection with a 
cemetery although the Society does own a few acres and sells lots. It may not 
be generally known that the Community Mausoleum was widely exploited as early 
as 1875, the idea then being, however, that the building would be in the built 
up portion of the city or on a lot in the city, entirely unconnected with the 
Cemetery.</p> 
<p>Sixth. Inculcation of the idea that the cemetery in which is his lot is his 
cemetery rather than the cemetery of the company from whom he bought his lot.
</p> 
<p>A wise and successful owner of a department store in Philadelphia told 
people to come in, make yourself at home, the store is yours&mdash;but until 
his time such was not the fashion; the idea has spread until at lunch counters 
and such places, little watch seems to be kept of what people take. If we can 
get our lot owners to think of the cemetery as My Cemetery and not as belonging 
to he West Laurel Hill Cemetery Company&mdash;he will be a good missionary for 
the Cemetery. Some may say that the idea of ownership leads to the claim for 
privileges which would ride over all reasonable rules and' to read some 
Cemetery pamphlets it would seem as if the pages should each be headed with the 
good old German Sign &quot;Es ist verboten&quot;.</p> 
<p>Of course, the guiding hand must be there and the restraining and guiding 
must be done through our first heading COURTESY which is ever working from 
prospect of a sale to the grandchildren who may, and often do, endow a lot. And 
now I must touch on a point which will seem great heresy to many of you and 
that is that nothing awakens the feeling of affection and a desire to spend 
money for flowers and care of the lot as does the grave mound. Ah! My fellow 
members of the Association of American Cemetery Superintendents do not allow 
yourselves to believe you are true economists from a Cemetery standpoint when 
you smooth out your lots and destroy the evidence of burial. You are cutting 
the ground from beneath your feet&mdash;you are destroying a perpetual source 
of income. Trouble!! WHAT IS TROUBLE? You say a grave mound is in the way of 
your lawn mower&mdash;you say a grave mound burns out in summer: But if you 
will cultivate your lot owners and their sons and their daughters you can get 
orders to plant and replant the grave mounds and those you can't get orders to 
plant and replant stand you in good stead to show the awfulness of neglect. My 
friends, a thousand grave mounds mean several hundred dollars profit a year 
when you work it in the right manner&mdash;WORK!! Oh yes work&mdash;perhaps our 
positions would fade away if we did not and do not work. Mrs. Smith says 
&quot;Look how nice Mrs. Jones' graves look&mdash;&quot;I cannot be behind 
her!!!&quot; This PROFIT on grave mounds will go on for years and will grow and 
grow.</p> 
<p>Seventh. Institution and Maintenance of a fund the income from which will 
provide for the future care of the Cemetery&mdash;this fund to be IN TRUST with 
a reliable Trust Company and out of the hand's of the changing Cemetery 
authorities. West Laurel Hill Cemetery has from the first sale of the lot laid 
away ten per cent of the purchase money to form with like sums from all, other 
lot sales a Permanent Fund, we call it, income from which is and shall 
hereafter be applied to the care of the Cemetery, its roads, walks, buildings 
and appurtenances and, as a matter of fact, as far as it will go to the care of 
lots. The money so laid away is placed IN TRUST with Trust Companies (Fifty 
Thousand dollars to one and then Fifty Thousand to another). This fund now 
amounts, July 1st, 1925, to $350,731.53. The founders of West Laurel Hill did 
not know who would follow them as managers and were quite aware that a man 
might be a first class Cemetery manager and a bad financier. So the managers 
were relieved of all care of the principal of the PERMANENT FUND&mdash;the 
interest and income being paid the Cemetery Company for the care of the 
Cemetery.<br>
 &nbsp;</p> 
<p>The Permanent Fund for any lot is not added to the selling price but is 
paid by the Cemetery Company itself as agreed in its deed to the first lot 
purchaser and with all purchasers after him. As you can see the Permanent Fund 
is a great source of income to a Cemetery and a little arithmetic will tell you 
that West Laurel Hill Cemetery with a permanent fund of $350,731.53 will 
receive within a year at only five percent, an income of $17,536.56 from this 
source alone.</p> 
<p>Eighth. The Institution of Individual Lot Endowments and inculcation of the 
fact that the lot holders lot should have a fund or endowment placed IN TRUST, 
the income to be for the upkeep of his property&mdash;HIS lot separate from the 
Cemetery General Fund. In all the States of the United States there are laws 
against trust in perpetuity except trusts which apply to Cemeteries and the 
care of cemetery lots. Seeing from the early years of our Republic that the 
European law of primogeniture held land and money in one family, to the 
detriment of the general public, our laws forbade such a course and no one can 
will their estate beyond their grandchildren; grandchildren cannot be denied 
the right to do as they choose with an estate received from a 
grandfather&mdash;however, our wise lawmakers, seeing every man must be allowed 
his burial place, and having in their hearts the feeling of us all, yes! Even 
us Cemetery Superintendents, that the place where our family is buried should 
be cared for FOREVER, have so shaped our laws that a fund may be left in 
perpetuity for the care of a Cemetery lot. At West Laurel Hill Cemetery we 
assiduously cultivate the placing of an endowment (as we call it in distinction 
from the Cemetery Company's Fund for the Perpetual Care of the Cemetery) for 
the care of the lot owners' own lot; and so successful is the system that in 
six months of 1925 we have received as follows:</p> 
<p>January, 13 endowments totaling&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $20,477.13 <br>
 
February, 7 endowments totaling&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3,300.00
<br> March, 12 endowments totaling&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 7,750.00
<br> April, 10 endowments totaling&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2,750.00
<br> May, 10 endowments totaling&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 
11,200.00<br>
 June, 18 endowments totaling&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 7,910.00</p> 
<p>And in 1924 there were 107 endowments totaling $59,527.75. We have now 874 
endowments totaling $528,891.25 besides hundreds of endowments placed 
separately with Trust Companies under the Wills of lot owners. If the lot is 
not endowed before his decease as soon as the lot owner is buried we send the 
heirs or the heir whom we know best a suggestion for an endowment and follow 
this suggestion in a proper manner until an endowment is made or the matter 
fails for the time being-perhaps another burial of a son or daughter of the lot 
owner will awaken a grandson or granddaughter to create the fund. The endowment 
when received is placed IN TRUST with the other endowments, all the endowments 
being lumped into one fund. When interest is paid, the proportional interest 
due each endowment is placed to its credit in the endowment ledger and each 
year a bill is rendered against each endowment just as our bills are rendered 
to our living customers. The West Laurel Hill Cemetery Company and the West 
Laurel Hill Cemetery Company TRUSTEE FOR ENDOWMENTS are two separate and 
distinct persons. The Bank account of the endowment income is, of course, a 
separate and distinct bank account from the Cemetery Company Bank Account. I 
cannot say too much in regard to ENDOWMENTS as a source of perpetual income to 
a Cemetery as lifting off the Cemetery Funds the care of lots and steadily 
producing income from the profit in doing the work required by the ENDOWMENT.

 Ninth. Burial Charges: <br>
 (a) Receiving Tomb Charges <br>
 
(b) Rental of Special Mausoleums<br>
 (c) Charges for digging graves and usual 
attention at funeral<br>
 (d) Charges for special grave structures <br>
 (e) 
Charges for grave and dirt pile decorations<br>
 (f) Charges for use of tent 
<br> (g) Removal charges </p> 
<p>(a) Receiving Tomb charges after deducting cost of entrance of body and 
interest on the investment, upkeep and cleaning are not much of a source of 
income but the Receiving Tomb at West Laurel Hill Cemetery is, nevertheless, a 
great source of income. Family reasons often make it proper that the final 
interment should be delayed; for such eases the Receiving Tomb offers a 
temporary resting place and the Receiving Tomb is a feeder for sales.</p> 
<p>(b) In 1911 the West Hill Cemetery Company built three Mausoleums for rent 
at a cost of $3,000.00 and from the time they were ready for occupancy they 
have never been vacant, except one at a time for a month; the rental charge is 
at the rate of $25.00 a month for each Mausoleum, being an income of $900.00 a 
year on an investment of $3,000.00. In 1921 we built three more of much better 
quality at $35.00 per month each and they are never vacant&mdash;indeed we have 
had a waiting list&mdash;an exchange from the Receiving Tomb being made to a 
Mausoleum as soon as possible. The construction at these Mausoleums was brought 
about because a prospective customer wanted to rent nine crypts in the 
Receiving Tomb so that there might not be anyone near his wife&mdash;but the 
Cemetery Company could not grant this request fearing the crypts might be 
needed.</p> 
<p>(c) The charges for digging graves and usual attendance at funerals are a 
source of small revenue at West Laurel Hill Cemetery, far smaller on analysts 
than lot holders suppose&mdash;the margin of profit is often a loss as the 
ground at West Laurel Hill is often stony and men frequently work all night. 
However, it would seem absurd' not to mention these charges, but in my Cemetery 
we often write the profit on the ice.</p> 
<p>(d) Grave structures as brick graves, whether enameled brick or plain red 
brick, concrete and brick and all the various structures, including concrete 
tombs or over boxes, all have a profit for the Cemetery.</p> 
<p>(e) Charges for graves and dirt pile decorations in the many and various 
forms used throughout the country are all sources of profit.</p> 
<p>(f) Some cemeteries charge for the use of tent and chairs. West Laurel Hill 
Cemetery does not charge for a tent; however, a tent is erected without charge 
in very inclement weather but never for clear winter weather or high wind.</p> 
<p>(g) Removal charges might be included under the digging of a grave except 
that the profit on removal charges is greater per removal than the profit from 
a grave at the time of a funeral.</p> 
<p>Tenth. Income from Construction of Foundations and Work Connected 
Therewith. In West Laurel Hill Cemetery all excavation and all foundations and 
exterior walls of vaults below the ground level are done by the Cemetery 
Company&mdash;all foundations are eight feet deep&mdash;the depth of a 
grave&mdash;and may of course, be deeper. There is a profit from this work, the 
percentage varying with the size of the work.</p> 
<p>Eleventh. Greenhouse Work:<br>
 (a) Bouquets, cut flowers, floral designs 
<br> (b) Christmas designs and decorations, Easter and Memorial Day floral 
requirements<br>
 (c) Special yearly care of lots<br>
 (d) Sodding and grading 
<br> (e) Grave planting <br>
 (f) Flower beds <br>
 (g) Special trees <br>
 (h) 
Talking up endowments</p> 
<p>All the above items at West Laurel Hill Cemetery come under the greenhouse. 
The greenhouse salesroom and the office are under one roof and it is hard to 
tell where one begins and the other ends&mdash;they lead up to each other. 
Special yearly care of lots is a heavy item at West Laurel Hill Cemetery; grave 
planting is a heavy item and flower beds also are an item of profit and the 
greenhouse work leads up to that important item of which I have spoken before.
</p> 
<p>Twelfth. Endowments: If I am placing emphasis on endowment of 
lots&mdash;special trust funds whose income is only to be used for the 
designated lot&mdash;it is because, like interest, it is working all the time. 
The income will continue long after we are dead and not only lift the expense 
of caring for that lot from the Cemetery, but will give a profit year after 
year. The solicitation for endowments is going on all the time at West Laurel 
Hill Cemetery even to the great grandchildren of the original lot holder. The 
money from a sale soon disappears but the income from an endowment will go on 
and on.</p>

<h2>Building A Perpetual Care Fund</h2>  Date Published:&nbsp;  August, 1925  
Original Author:&nbsp;  Leslie T. Fargher  Original Publication:&nbsp;  AACS 
Proceedings of the 39th Annual Convention 
<p>In the few years in which I have been in charge of the business of our 
cemetery and a member of this Association I have watched with considerable 
interest the papers presented to the conventions and the various topics that 
appear in our magazine &quot;Park and Cemetery&quot;. Organizing, planning, 
landscape, management, rules and regulations, care, accounting, advertising and 
laws affecting cemetery operation have all been freely discussed and with much 
benefit to us all. But there seems to be one subject above all others in which 
practically all modern cemetery men are most interested, and that is Perpetual 
Care and how it can be provided for.&nbsp; I believe those two words 
&quot;Perpetual Care&quot; are about the most commonly used words in our modern 
cemetery business.</p> 
<p>I know they are words that have different meanings to some of us, depending 
upon the age of our own cemeteries, and how the term applies to them. But I am 
not here to talk to you on this point for I realize that each of us have a 
problem more or less different and distinct from the others. Whether or not we 
have perpetual care provisions in any of the various methods to which the term 
applies, we probably are convinced to the last man of us, that in this day and 
age it is absolutely essential that our cemeteries be properly cared for so 
that we shall not be guilty of the disgraceful neglect that has characterized 
the past.</p> 
<p>I think, too, that we are all pretty well convinced that the purchase price 
of ground should be sufficient to provide its proportionate share toward the up 
building of a trust fund for the maintenance and perpetuation of the entire 
cemetery. That, of course, would be the ideal condition under which. to 
operate, and is a condition that prevails in the affairs of some of our largest 
and best cemeteries, especially in the larger cities where the percentage of 
sale price as applied to the care fund is immediately sufficient for this 
purpose.</p> 
<p>But, perhaps there are others here like myself who are realizing that in 
selling ground with the promise or contract, of perpetual care we have taken on 
an obligation that might some day become difficult of fulfillment. In other 
words, we have sold our ground for too small a price, and thereby sold more of 
it than necessary, and as a result we have increased our burden for all time to 
come.</p> 
<p>A small price must, of necessity, yield but a small fund, for we all know 
that from our annual sales there must first come the bulk of our annual 
expenditures. To most of' us in the smaller cities high prices for cemetery 
ground are out of the question. We are just as ambitious to have our cemeteries 
beautiful and provide the best care possible but we cannot obtain the prices 
that will do these things and also add sufficient to the care fund.</p> 
<p>This is exactly the situation that we face in our business at Freeport, 
Illinois. We have been operating for 23 years one of the most beautiful 
cemeteries in America and have from the beginning sold all lots with perpetual 
care provided. Our fund at present is far less than it should be, amounting to 
but about 5 1/10 cents per foot of sold ground. When there is added to this 
sold ground its proportionate share of the upkeep expense of the whole cemetery 
it shows how ridiculously small it is. During the earlier years of our business 
there was a ten percent deposit to the trust fund and later this was increased 
to twenty percent.&nbsp; This latter figure most of you would say is a fair 
proportion of sales to devote to the fund and I believe is used by many 
cemeteries. However, when you consider that with our prices advanced each year 
we are now obtaining only sixty to ninety cents per foot for ground you will 
readily understand why it is still too small to accomplish what a trust fund is 
created for.</p> 
<p>Shortly after assuming charge of our cemetery I began to wonder just how 
large our fund would become under the plan; what the perpetual care of the 
cemetery would require in interest earnings and whether, after all our ground 
was sold, it would be in any way adequate.</p> 
<p>We were drawing all interest from the fund annually to assist in caring for 
the cemetery so that the fund could be increased only by the sales installments 
we placed to it. Therefore, for example, when our property, which consists of a 
little over one hundred acres, had possibly totaled sales of three million 
dollars we would have but six hundred thousand dollars in the fund.</p> 
<p>In endeavoring to estimate our needs I find that some of our cemetery men 
have reached the conclusion that there should be at least fifty cents per foot 
in the trust fund. This seems more than necessary until we consider that it is 
not merely the individual lot that will sometime be dependent upon the interest 
earnings but rather the entire property, of which the general or public parts 
may be the more expensive in maintenance. Looking into the long, dim future 
none of us can tell just what the costs of operating or rather perpetuating our 
cemeteries will be, so that all we can do is try to provide abundantly and 
trust in the future conditions.</p> 
<p>Studying over the problem, I decided that even if at sometime we were to 
obtain sufficiently large prices for our ground there would yet remain all the 
ground already sold that had not contributed its full share to the fund. There 
can be but one solution to this problem of inadequate apportionment to the fund 
and it is through the assistance of compound interest.</p> 
<p>I have prepared printed copies of a sheet of figures that I worked out and 
these will tell you more than I have time to tell you here. I have here also a 
chart of some of the results obtained by my method of building up a trust fund' 
which is now to be adopted by our Association. The surprising figures will show 
you that we will cut our deposits in two, create a vastly larger fund and draw 
out more interest than under the simple 20% plan.</p> 
<p>There are four uncertain factors in figuring as I have done. We do not know 
just what acreage or footage will be developed from the property we own; how 
long it will take to sell it all; how much may be sold each year and what the 
prices will be. And so for a basis of figuring I begin with estimated sales of 
twelve thousand dollars a year as an average for the next ten years and 
increase it one thousand dollars every ten year period, estimating that it may 
take 150 years to sell out. I have assumed that five percent is a fair 
expectation of interest earnings. Both our old and new methods are therefore 
figured alike as to sales and interest. No consideration has been given to the 
cost of administering the fund either way tor it is rather negligible as 
compared with the total earnings.</p> 
<p>To begin at the beginning of our whole program regarding our Perpetual Care 
Fund. We are incorporated as Oakland Cemetery Association, though in fact we 
are but a stock company and are not in any way operating under any laws of the 
state governing cemeteries. If we interpret the laws correctly, we, as a profit 
sharing corporation cannot set aside a perpetual trust. We therefore propose to 
incorporate a voluntary lot owners association which will nave for its object 
the care of the trust fund and finally the perpetuating of the cemetery. This 
association will be empowered to create and elect a Board of Trustees, this 
Board to have the actual control of the Perpetual Care Fund. The further 
purpose of this second Corporation is to prevent the stockholders of the 
Cemetery Association having any chance to recall any or this entire fund.</p> 
<p>Agreements will be made and recorded, between the operating company and the 
lot owners association which will set forth the methods and purpose of creating 
the fund and defining the conduct of both parties for all time. Each and every 
deed given for lots will carry with it enough of a contract for the ten percent 
of the purchaser's money to make it binding on both associations. Our attorney 
believes he can in this way make a three cornered contract that, as he 
expressed it, &quot;no man on earth can ever break.&quot;</p> 
<p>The application of the ten percent of sales will be made as long as ground 
is sold, so that, for as long as there shall be lot owners alive, there may be 
expected to be interest manifested in the project from these lot owners. Beyond 
that time a competent court will have to appoint the Trustees.</p> 
<p>Each year the Trustees will retain two percent interest on the total fund 
as of the first of the year. To offset the loss due to inability to re-invest 
the odd amounts of earned interest to the last odd dollars and cents, the 
installments from sales shall be paid over to the Trustees semi-annually. The 
actual investing of the fund shall be through one of the largest Trust 
Companies in Chicago and all investments will be ratified by our local Board of 
Trustees. The Secretary of the Cemetery Association shall be the Secretary of 
the Lot Owners Association, thus providing the latter Association with a 
working officer who will always be in a position to look after its affairs.</p> 
<p>I have figured various other compound interest schemes for long periods of 
time only to discard them when they failed to produce the desired result. We 
cannot afford to appropriate to the fund much more than we have in the past, 
and so I finally found that by using two percent as the compounding figure we 
would actually be saving something to ourselves for some years to come. Then, 
gradually, it will turn to a loss to us until the interest earnings mount up to 
a considerable figure when it will again begin to show a balance in favor of 
the cemetery.</p> 
<p>The printed copies show only figures for each five years but to arrive at 
these it was of course necessary to carry out the entire scheme for each year. 
Some of the interesting items from the detail of the yearly figures are as 
follows:</p> 
<p>In the 48th year of our new plan shows its first gain in the total amount 
in the Trust Fund and in the 115th year it is double the amount in the old 
plan. In the end it is more than three times as much.</p> 
<p>Each year, in the beginning, shows a result in favor of the cemetery, 
decreasing yearly. The Total gain up to the 14th year is $6,033.27. The 
following year the result is in favor of the trust fund and it continues so 
until the 85th year during which time the operating income has suffered a loss 
of over $58,000.00. In this 85th year it again begins to add to the operating 
revenue and as the two percent interest earnings are now beginning to build up 
heavily, the gain of operating revenue increases very rapidly until at the end 
of the 150 years it shows a net gain over the losses of $544,937.11.</p> 
<p>In speaking of loss or gain I mean that in the old plan we take all the 
interest earned. Under the new plan, we take all interest over the two percent 
which is returned to the fund, also the ten percent of sales which we do not 
place to the fund. The difference between these two incomes produces loss or 
gain to the operating revenue.</p> 
<p>I know that the statements on this chart look like a paradox, but strange 
as they may seem they are nevertheless true. We will put in half as much, build 
possibly three times or more as big a fund and draw out more in earnings.</p> 
<p>Now, there will be a provision made that whenever the fund has reached a 
total equivalent to fifty cents for each foot of ground that has been sold and 
that fifty cents per foot appears at that time to be sufficient, the 
compounding rate may be decreased below two percent by agreement of the 
operating association and the Trustees.</p> 
<p>We have formally adopted the entire plan as I have outlined it to you and 
our attorney is now engaged in the work necessary to the perfecting of the Lot 
Owners Association. We have gone at it with much thought and we are satisfied 
that it will guarantee to our lot owners the full meaning of Perpetual Care. If 
there are others like us, whose fund is too small to represent the amount of 
ground already sold, I believe they can find in our plan a way to improve their 
fund slowly and surely, without lessening their income. If you cannot apply 
from your sales price enough to be immediately sufficient, there is no other 
way than through compounding a portion of your interest, to keep faith with 
your lot owners.</p> 
<p>A comparatively small initial fund, invested and compound in g at its full 
interest earnings would in a like time produce an ample fund, but it would 
yield no annual returns for the care of the sold ground. It may seem queer too, 
that we should add to our fund an amount from lot purchasers money which would 
be much less than what we would withdraw from the fund but in this we are 
following the belief that people are really not much interested in anything 
that has not east them, something and we earnestly solicit the interest and aid 
of our lot owners.</p> 
<p>We desire that our people shall think of the cemetery as a community affair 
and cooperate with us in making and keeping it forever beautiful, well 
cared-for and absolutely permanent.<br>

<h2>Evolution in Cemetery Work</h2>  Date Published:&nbsp;  August, 1925  
Original Author:&nbsp;  William Holbrooks  Oak Hill Cemetery, Evansville, 
Indiana  Original Publication:&nbsp;  AACS Proceedings of the 39th Annual 
Convention 
<p>After twenty-seven years active management as Superintendent of Oak Hill 
Cemetery, the best I can do is to recall what has been accomplished in that 
time and to whom the credit is due.</p> 
<p>I am a firm believer in evolution in some things and the manner of 
conducting a cemetery is one. I claim no great credit for myself, but prefer to 
give it to those with whom I have come in contact during that time. To take 
over an old established cemetery and work it over to meet present day demands 
was no light job.</p> 
<p>Before beginning my work I took a survey of my surroundings and set about 
making necessary changes and here is where I feel that much credit is due 
others. A visit to Cave Hill Cemetery, Louisville, was the first trip made and 
Mr. Robert Campbell, Superintendent, shall always be remembered for the many 
courtesies shown me by making suggestions as to changes that were advisable. 
Next, a visit to Spring Grove, Cincinnati and there I came in contact with 
William Salway, who in turn gave much valuable information as to cemetery 
management. Between the two, Mr. Campbell and Mr. Salway I hardly know which to 
give the most credit.<br>
 &nbsp;</p> 
<p>After I began digesting what I had learned as to what a cemetery 
superintendent should be and do, then the size of the job I had assumed began 
to dawn upon me and evolution set in. Everything from the office to the 
smallest detail in the yard had to be overhauled. I had much prejudice to 
overcome as we gradually changed the manner of doing things and we are such 
creatures of habit that it goes against the grain to make a change, however 
advisable.</p> 
<p>One change was to do away with filling graves in the presence of the family 
and friends, which was accomplished by patience on our part and reasons for 
such change. Along with this change we gained approval by better service, such 
as providing tents for the family and friends during committal service, a 
lowering device and such. Next, we began restrictions as to monuments and 
markers on lots, and then we had trouble enough. Years of worry, argument and 
finally absolute refusal to deviate from a given course convinced our lot 
owners that such was to be the rule.</p> 
<p>In 1905 our association became affiliated with the National Association of 
Cemetery Superintendents.</p> 
<p>At Rochester, New York I met those good fellows that have since become such 
good advisers, that I shall ever feel under obligations for much friendly 
advice. Some have gone to their reward, and may it be great&mdash;Wm. Stone, 
Timothy McCarthy and others. Of those living are George M. Painter of 
Philadelphia, Edward G. Carter and W. N. Rudd of Chicago and many others. These 
men were always ready to give advice based upon their experience on any subject 
submitted for their consideration. So thus, we were encouraged in our work, for 
without such friendly assistance we perhaps would have made more mistakes than 
we have.</p> 
<p>I have submitted for the question box a subject that has caused the writer 
some annoyance. For a while I was flattered by having a printed form submitted 
covering every phase of cemetery management imaginable, which I laboriously 
answered and prided myself on being able to display my knowledge. But after a 
while the thing became monotonous and I began to think there were some people 
who needed enlightenment, but my feathers fell when I was informed that my 
replies were being used by promoters to further their interests in land deals 
for profit to themselves.</p> 
<p>This may be my swan song, as I have gone quite a journey in life, but in 
spite of a handicap dating back six years, I am in fairly good working 
condition, but I want you to know that I consider the AACS one of the most 
unselfish institutions of which I have any knowledge.</p> 
<p>Reverting to reforms, the automobile is another. I well remember the first 
machine that was driven in our cemetery; what a commotion was raised. A near 
panic was on hand in about two seconds by some old ladies and horses that had 
passed the voting age, making things lively for a short while. Then, we put a 
clamp on automobiles. Next we admitted by license and a fee. More trouble. 
Finally the horse was eliminated and the automobile is at this date supreme. 
But we have a troublesome problem to meet at times on Memorial Day in 
particular; we believe we have found a solution.</p> 
<p>On last Memorial Day 1625 automobiles were admitted from 7 A. M. to 12 noon 
at one gate when all vehicles were excluded for the balance of the day. The 
afternoon is given to exercises of the G. A. R., and the attendance of visitors 
is on foot only. Our cemetery was established in 1851 and the avenues were 
ample for that date but since the advent of the auto and the many times 
multiplied numbers as compared with horse-drawn vehicles, makes it quite 
necessary to control them in some manner, at times. Admittance at the west or 
Columbia Street entrance and exit at the south or Virginia Street. One way 
traffic and signs directing the way, and &quot;No Parking on This Avenue&quot; 
enforced by officers supplemented by Boy Scouts to the number of about forty 
solved the problem satisfactorily.</p> 
<p>So you see why I believe in evolution, or perhaps some would prefer the 
word reform.</p> 
<p>Our first reform was in the office, such as records, diagrams of lots, much 
detail, records, etc. Out in the yard avenues were widened, and in some 
instances rebuilt entirely, much planting of trees and shrubbery and a clearing 
of trees in burial sections and assuming of tree-planting by ourselves.</p>

<h2>Cemetery Finances</h2>  Date Published:&nbsp;  August, 1925  Original 
Author:&nbsp;  S. L. Landers  Original Publication:&nbsp;  AACS Proceedings of 
the 39th Annual Convention 
<p>I am somewhat handicapped, perhaps owe you an apology for being down to 
read a paper, but coming across the border from Canada I stopped in the village 
of Detroit for a little while and went up town, opened my grip to get out 
something and sitting down on a street corner a Billy goat came along and ate 
my paper. I believe that Frank Eurich is somewhat responsible for it, and I 
have no paper to read. I had to hastily jot down a few memos and I 
unfortunately have no paper.</p> 
<p>When I decided to read this paper at this convention, or rather this 
subject and the committee asked me what it would be I gave them a subject and 
they switched it on me a little bit and changed it. I gave them a subject 
&quot;Dead Horse Finances.&quot; It, perhaps, to a cemetery superintendent, 
seemed a little gruesome to talk about anything dead and they switched it on me 
and made it &quot;Cemetery Finances.&quot;</p> 
<p>Cemetery finances might mean a great many things. It might mean lot selling 
campaigns, investment of perpetual care funds or the allotment of various 
classes of labor or the purchase of new grounds and the setting aside of so 
much money annually for the purchase of extensions, etc., etc. That has been 
covered in a great many ways.</p> 
<p>My talk this morning is not going to be particularly on cemetery finances 
generally, but what my subject really intended to be&mdash;dead horse finances.
</p> 
<p>John Bright, great British parliamentarian, whenever a question was raised 
in the House of Commons that had been dealt with and had been voted into 
oblivion many a time was brought up by some new member, John Bright usually 
said &quot;Oh, that is dead horse, gone, forgotten, voted on many a time and 
passed up.&quot;</p> 
<p>I am going to say a few words on delinquent finances, finances that we have 
given up hope of ever collecting. This question does not apply to new 
cemeteries that have been started right under the perpetual care plan. The 
cemetery that I represent was started in 1848. Of course those of you that were 
at Hamilton will realize that Woodland Cemetery, the new one on the bay front, 
will not have the problem of the collection of dead horse finances that we have 
in this old cemetery.</p> 
<p>I know that these questions have been discussed from every angle. I am only 
a young cub at the game, although I was a member of our Cemetery Commission for 
many years previous to becoming the Superintendent and you all know that 
cemetery board members or cemetery commissioners have but a very meager 
knowledge of the actual cemetery problems. They attend board meetings, the 
secretary or superintendent introduces his report and they have a very 
superficial knowledge of what really is the cemetery superintendent's problem 
and I know that these questions have been discussed from every angle.</p> 
<p>I was only in the office six months before I found a state of affairs that 
rather astounded me. I will admit we all have our strong points in every sphere 
of life on certain things. One man will be able to accomplish great things in a 
certain sphere, along a certain line. Another man will supersede him and he 
will have strong points on entirely different lines and make a success of 
something else that the other chap had perhaps forgotten or, rather, was not 
strong on. So we all have our strong features.</p> 
<p>I realize my predecessor, who was one of the best cemetery men, Mr. F. H. 
Rutherford, took hold of an old practically medieval cemetery, with the various 
grades and copings and fences and iron and tripods and wood and glass bottles 
by the million and everything else and devoted the most of his time to the 
outside grounds and made a magnificent cemetery out of an old practically rural 
burial ground, even though we have 120,000 population in our city. But when you 
concentrate on one particular thing naturally other things suffer.</p> 
<p>When I succeeded Mr. Rutherford I did not have very much to do, as it were, 
on the outside grounds, but could devote the majority of my attention to the 
office. No individual is at fault, neither a superintendent, office staff, 
commission or a board, but rather a system that had grown up in practice for 
many years.</p> 
<p>The question I found was that thousands&mdash;we have 11,000 lots in our 
cemetery, apart from our single graves&mdash;we had about 3,000 cards that we 
were sending out for annual care. Those that were square and honest came and 
paid; those that did not want to pay never came near the office. Naturally, 
while we checked it up against the lot, many lots had no card as far as the 
financial end of it was concerned, no card at all.</p> 
<p>I said to my board &quot;Is it fair to permit or allow or compel some 
people to pay and let many other people get away with it without paying at all? 
Something must be done to try and collect some of this old money.&quot;</p> 
<p>I used to see a woman come in, one, two, yes a dozen of them, when 
carnations were $1.00 a dozen and roses $1.00 a dozen, drive up in their motor 
cars and want to know &quot;where is the gardener? Where is the sub-gardener? 
How is it that this is not done on my lot and this on my lot?&quot; I'd go over 
the card and say &quot;Madam, do you know you have not paid any care since 
1914, and you want the service of a gardener and you complain about it and you 
complain about the ant hills. I can't tell the ants what lot to go on. You 
complain about the condition of the graves. If you don't pay your care you will 
get no service in this cemetery. You can come up here when carnations and roses 
are $1.00 a dozen and place them on your lot, but we don't get a cent of care 
and we pay our men 50&cent; an hour and we care for your lot and have got it 
charged up against you.&quot;</p> 
<p>True, we have the same rule that the majority of you have that no interment 
can take place in a lot until the care dues are paid, but you have got to wait 
until somebody kicks in and you may go before they do, and your successor may 
not be as strenuous as you to collect it.</p> 
<p>I had a younger man appointed on our board by the City Council.&nbsp; He 
was in the wholesale grocery business, a shrewd young financier, and he used to 
say to me &quot;What are our assets?&quot;</p> 
<p>I said &quot;You get them. You get our buildings. You get our supplies, 
tools and everything, an inventory in the annual statement. You know what our 
assets are.&quot;</p> 
<p>&quot;Oh, but I mean our assets, our bills receivable.&quot; </p> 
<p>I said &quot;Forget it. They are receivable after you have got them. You 
will see them in the report on the right side or the statement after we get 
them. There is no such thing as bills receivable because very few people are 
paying.&quot;</p> 
<p>He said &quot;What kind or a business do we run? We ought to have assets 
showing our bills receivable.&quot;</p> 
<p>He pressed and pressed and kept on every meeting for about a year for these 
bills receivable. I said &quot;Frank, forget it. If I show you an account of 
our bills receivable in this cemetery it will make your nose bleed.&quot; But 
he insisted upon the bills receivable, and I got busy and gave him some bills 
receivable. No, what I did was this:&nbsp; I arranged it for an annual report 
in one of my annual reports, and after it was printed and was not bound, still 
in the printer's hands, I asked him to strike me off a certain number or 
copies, and I went to the Chairman of our Finance Committee and the Chairman of 
our Board, Mr. Peebles, who, by the way, visited my office a day or two 
previous to the convention and asked me to convey his best wishes to the 
members of the Association&mdash;our former Chairman who, by the way, is not 
now our Chairman&mdash;he was elected to the City Council, and had to resign, 
because our by-laws don't permit an elective member in the City Council to act 
on our board and I took it down to the Chairman and read it to him. This was 
the statement:</p> 
<p> &quot;ANNUAL CARE AND DELINQUENT LOT OWNERS&quot;</p> 
<p>I have frequently been asked to compile a list of our assets, i. e., monies 
due for annual care, of from three to twenty years or more.</p> 
<p>I have not as yet been able to complete this list, owing to the many lots 
tor which no card exists. This work, which is long and tedious, owing to the 
imperfect records kept during the early years of the Cemetery, necessitates a 
great deal of research, but is steadily going forward.</p> 
<p>As far as we have proceeded we find there is due the Cemetery Board 
$22,643.13 for annual care, which consists of 188,365 square feet of ground, 
which, if placed in Perpetual Care would mean an additional $65,927.85. And it 
is safe to say that the unlisted lots when completed will add an additional 50 
percent of the above figures (a report of which will be made later when the 
report is completed), with means that there is due the Cemetery Board for 
delinquent annual care about $30,000.00, and if placed in Perpetual Care an 
additional $90,000.00 or a total of $120,000.00.</p> 
<p>Taking into consideration that many of these lots are filled, and the 
owners passed away, others left the city, descendants refusing to acknowledge 
obligations, etc., etc. only a small percentage of this is collectable.</p> 
<p>When I showed that to the Chairman and the Chairman of the Finance 
Committee, they said &quot;Don't put that in your report. We don't want the 
public to know who are paying that there are a lot of other fellows not paying 
or they will stop paying.&quot; They said &quot;Cut it out.&quot;&nbsp;</p> 
<p>I mailed it to the board members, but this young smart business man 
insisted upon having a complete report of the assets. I kept telling him to 
forget it, but he insisted upon the assets and I gave him a final report when 
it was completed.</p> 
<p>February, 1925</p> 
<p>To the Board of Management of the Hamilton Cemeteries: </p> 
<p>Gentlemen: </p> 
<p>I have frequently been asked to prepare a resume of indebtedness to the 
Hamilton Cemetery, or &quot;Asset&quot;, i. e. if all lots were paid up, as far 
as Annual Care was concerned and the same placed in Perpetual Care.</p> 
<p>At the end of 1923 a part report was presented and the &quot;Assets&quot; 
were so large it was thought unwise to reproduce the same in the Annual Report. 
At that time only part was shown as there were many old lots for which no card 
existed.</p> 
<p>In this Report all Lots in the Cemetery are listed and tabulated which 
shows an enormous amount of money so called &quot;outstanding&quot;.</p> 
<p>Eventually about ten to fifteen percent or this will be collectable; hence 
while a copy is prepared, I feel it would be very unwise to make it public, as 
it would be misunderstood and many who are now paying and those who have a 
further tendency to pay up later may defer payment on the plea, with so large 
an &quot;Asset&quot; in addition to the Perpetual Care sinking fund, there is 
already ample funds to carry on the Cemetery for the rest of time.</p> 
<p>There are all told 10,660 plots in the Hamilton Cemetery of which 6,446 are 
in Perpetual Care and 4,214 not. Of the 4,214 not in Perpetual Care; 3,261 are 
not paying at all while 955 are paying some regularly and some occasionally.</p>
<p>Of the 3,261 who are not paying at all, 1,561 are two grave lots of 60 
square feet each or a total of 93,600 sq. ft. They owe $25.00 each back care or 
a total of $39,025.00 and if placed in Perpetual Care would mean an additional 
$32,781.00.</p> 
<p>The rest of those not paying 1700, own four grave lots 120 sq ft. each, owe 
$50.00 each for back care or a total of $85,000 and if placed in Perpetual Care 
204,000 sq. ft. would mean an additional $71,400.</p> 
<p>Of the 955 that are paying if these were to pay up the Annual Care to date 
at an average of $2.00 each per year would mean $19,100.00 and if placed in 
Perpetual Care would mean a further sum of $29,610.00 or a general grand total 
of<br>
 39,025.00 <br>
 32,781.00<br>
 85,000.00<br>
 71,400.00<br>
 19,100.00
<br> 29,610.00<br>
 -------------<br>
 &nbsp;$276,916.00 </p> 
<p>All of which is respectfully submitted, <br>
 S. L. Landers, Secretary</p> 
<p> I said to my board &quot;It is going to be an absolute impossibility to 
collect but a very, very small proportion of that fund. If you members of this 
board will give me a free hand and I will use it very reasonably, and cooperate 
with me, and give me your endorsement, I will get a pretty good proportion of 
that dead horse finance, if you will back me up.&quot;</p> 
<p>You see, we care for all lots in our cemetery, whether they are paid for or 
not, that is, whether care is paid for or not; even if they don't pay annual 
care we care for every lot in the cemetery from the East gate to the West gate 
and from the North gate to the South gate, and the man that pays does not get a 
bit better attention than the fellow that does not pay. We feel for humanity's 
sake, general appearances sake&mdash;of course we rob Peter to pay Paul, we 
take it from the other fellow that does pay and spend it on this fellow, and we 
don't guarantee, as was spoken of last night, to devote the particular money on 
that particular lot. We are not bothered with the question of taxation, as 
municipal cemeteries. We agree to take care of that man's lot in perpetual 
care, but we don't pledge that that money will be spent particularly on that 
lot, but devoted to trees, shrubs, roads, administration and the general care 
of the cemetery.</p> 
<p>The first thing I said to my board was &quot;Our rules are somewhat 
antiquated. Revise your rules according to certain suggestions and I will get 
the money.&quot; The first thing we did&mdash;people used to walk in there and 
order a monument. The first few months I was in there I watched the girl. The 
monument men came in and ordered a foundation and the girl would get the card 
out, give the foreman the order and the foundation was ordered. People would 
come in and want various work done, transfer a lot from father to son or friend 
to friend, if there were no burials in it and everything was done without any 
consideration as to the actual status of the lot.</p> 
<p>We had the rules changed. No transfer could be made, no flowers could be 
planted; we would not do any work for them; nothing for nothing. We said 
&quot;You are not paying us anything and we will give you no consideration and 
no favors until you do pay.&quot; We made certain restrictions that no transfer 
could be granted on a lot upon which the perpetual care was not paid.</p> 
<p>I said to my board, &quot;Under the new system we compel people to pay the 
perpetual care at the time of the purchase of the lot. Now is it unfair to make 
that rule retroactive and make the old lot owners, when they come up for 
burial, pay the perpetual care on the old lot? If Bill Smith comes up and says 
I am a blacksmith or shoemaker&mdash;unfortunately my wife died; I want to buy 
a lot, we don't ask him any questions. We sell him a lot under the new system 
with the perpetual care added to it. He asks no questions and pays it. Is it 
any more unfair to make it retroactive and if Bill Smith or John Smith or Pete 
Jones or somebody&mdash;by the way, Mr. Jones, we have them there, too&mdash;if 
Mr. Jones comes up and wants to bury we say &ldquo;Yes, you have an old lot, 
but you have to pay the perpetual care on your lot and the back care before you 
can bury in that lot.&quot;</p> 
<p>My board said to me &quot;Sh, sh, you can't do anything like that. The 
deeds don't call for that. That is illegal. You can't do it. How can you make a 
non pay perpetual care on a lot when he bought it under the old system of 
annual care? You can't do it.&quot;</p> 
<p>When it was referred to our corporation counsel he said &quot;Tut, tut, 
tut, no, no, don't start anything like that. You are going to get into 
lawsuits. You are going to have trouble. It is illegal.&quot;</p> 
<p>It reminded me&mdash;we had a political campaign on in a town that was 
called Berlin, but was changed to Kitchener during the war, up in Ontario. We 
had an independent political campaign on the same as your late recent friend 
LaFolette. We had a political campaign against the two old parties, and I 
happened to be with the independent party and we were discussing the question 
of method and various questions came up. One fellow suggested this and' another 
chap suggested that. One fellow said something and then another man got up and 
said &quot;Oh yes, hold on a minute, but that is illegal.&quot;</p> 
<p>Sitting in that same room was, not an elderly man, of German descent, and 
old Henry Stultz had been in a great many political campaigns with the old 
parties. As soon as that fellow said &quot;This is illegal,&quot; Henry got up 
and said &quot;Vas is illegal. Nothing is illegal,&quot; meaning anything you 
can get away with in reason is not illegal.</p> 
<p>I told my board and corporation counsel, &quot;illegal nothing. Leave it to 
me. If you will give me the cooperation I will get away with it. Put that in 
your rules that at the time of an interment in an old lot the perpetual care on 
that old lot must be paid.&quot;</p> 
<p>The furthest I could get them to go was that it should be paid, and they 
revised the rules and said that at the time of an interment in the old lot the 
perpetual care should be paid. I said &quot;If that is as far as you go I am an 
opportunist, all right. Let it go at that.&quot; They passed it and we revised 
the rules. But I soon forgot the should and I made it must immediately.&nbsp; I 
sent out my card with my annual care, and this card went out with it, with the 
annual care cards or bills the following year to cemetery lot owners:</p> 
<p>&quot;This is your notice for the care of your lot for 1925. This account 
is really due in advance; when you received your first notice in May.<br>
 As a 
result of many non-payments we were compelled to borrow the money to pay the 
workmen during the season.<br>
 An immediate response will be appreciated. <br>

 This account can be paid at the City Treasurer's office, City Hall, if 
accompanied by the enclosed bill.</p> 
<p>Very truly yours, <br>
 Board of Managers of Hamilton Cemetery, <br>
 S. L. 
Landers, Secy-Supt</p> 
<p>&quot;To Cemetery Lot Owners under &quot;ANNUAL CARE&quot; <br>
 You have 
often been reminded that commuting and paying a lump sum places your lot in 
PERPETUAL CARE and gives you a perpetual care deed.</p> 
<p>&quot;I will some day&quot; has no doubt oft been your thought&mdash;<br>
 
WHY NOT NOW?<br>
 Especially since the new ruling, that all old lots under 
Annual Care must be planed in Perpetual Care at either the time of an 
interment, disinterment, or the placing of a monument.<br>
 Phone the Cemetery 
Office: Regent 1320 for information.<br>
 S. L. LANDERS, Secretary&quot; </p> 
<p>On the bills that I sent out in red type, I had a panel inserted in red 
type which said &quot;all lots under annual care must be placed in perpetual 
care at the time of an interment.&quot; The result was&mdash;you know, there 
are two ways of killing a chicken. One way is to simply lay him down on a block 
and knock his block off. Another way is, you can taka that chicken and smooth 
the feathers up and down one way and humor him to death and&mdash;jerk it and 
break his neck.</p> 
<p>I said to my board, &quot;Leave it to me. I will get the money and I will 
do it very, very carefully.&quot; You might be astounded' to know that in three 
years we have had absolutely no difficulty in collecting our perpetual care at 
the time of interment. We have had a little argument. I remember the worst two 
cases I had&mdash;one was the police lieutenant and one a lieutenant in the 
fire department, who kicked and were not going to pay.</p> 
<p>I will tell you one thing&mdash;the only instance in which it works an 
injustice is the man who paid religiously and regularly his annual care in 
advance; as soon as he got his bill his check came, or they paid it at the city 
hall, at the city treasurer's department, or at the cemetery. It worked 
somewhat of a little injustice to those people who paid regularly, but they 
were few and far between.</p> 
<p>I had people say to me &quot;Do you mean to tell me that I can't bury in my 
lot and you refuse to let me bury if I don't pay this perpetual care?&quot;</p> 
<p>I said &quot;No, I would not say that.&quot; At the same time I meant it 
all the time. &quot;No, I would not think of saying that you can't bury in your 
lot and that we are going to prohibit you from burying.&quot; I knew that they 
would not get out to get a compulsory order or a restraining order from the 
judge, restraining us from interfering with them, because they usually want to 
bury the next day or two days after and before they could get a restraining or 
a compulsory order it would take some time. &quot;No, I would not think of 
saying anything of that description. Of course, if you insist on burying and 
will not pay, that is different. But now look here, you don't want any special 
privileges over all the other citizens, do you? We have had so many thousand 
burials since the rule has gone into force and everybody met it without any 
discussion. Do you want any special favors? You will thank me in six months or 
a year because I compelled you to pay for perpetual care. Haven't you been 
thinking every time you got the bill that you ought to put it in perpetual 
care?&quot; &quot;Well, yes, ____&rdquo; &quot;Well come on, don't make two 
bites of a cherry. Let&rsquo;s clean it up. Why stick at this little perpetual 
care? I'll admit at the time of a funeral there are funeral expenses and 
everything.&quot;</p> 
<p>The main object was, we didn't care so much about the past annual 
care&mdash;our cemetery was practically sold out&mdash;we wanted to clean up 
that dead horse finance, so the old annual care was difficult to collect. You 
know yourselves, everyone or you, that when it gets down to second and third 
generations and grand nephews and grand nieces and brothers-in-law it is hard 
to collect, even from the first generation. Sons as a rule refuse to pay. We 
made all sorts of rebates on the old annual care in order to get the perpetual 
care. If a man came in and owed $70 or $40 or $50 annual care in 
arrears&mdash;like the women for bargains; they are out this morning&mdash;a 
lot of people like to get something for nothing. If you tell a man &quot;You 
owe $70 back or $40 back care; I will tell you what we will do. We will rebate 
that to 50%.&quot;</p> 
<p>It all depends upon the circumstances. If it is a son we make him pay the 
biggest portion. We make him pay half. If it is a second or third cousin or 
friend or a society or something we almost cut the entire back care off. But 
get the lots into perpetual care, because we knew if we could get that into our 
sinking fund it would mean for all time looking after that lot.</p> 
<p>Then we had this abandoned lot act passed. I think the state of New York, 
the state of Iowa and the state of Wisconsin have this abandoned lot act. We 
had this abandoned lot act passed.&nbsp; I think the state of New York, the 
state of Iowa and the state of Wisconsin have this abandoned lot act.&nbsp; We 
had this abandoned lot act passed.</p> 
<p>An Act to Amend the Cemetery Act</p> 
<p>His Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Legislative Assembly 
of the Province of Ontario, enacts as follows:</p> 
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This Act may be cited as The Cemetery Amendment Act, 
192.3.</p> 
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Section 23 of The Cemetery Act is amended by adding 
thereto the following subsection:<br>
 (2) The owner of a cemetery may after 
having advertised once a week for three successive weeks in a newspaper 
approved by the local board, for relatives of the person in whose name an 
abandoned cemetery lot stands (where such abandonment has existed for at least 
five years) and where such lot is not claimed and any dues or charges with 
respect thereto are not paid within six months after the last publication of 
such notice, the owner, upon the expiration of the said period may apply to the 
Judge of the County or District Court and the Judge upon such application and 
upon proof of the facts and of the publication of such notice and of the 
non-payment of such dues and charges and upon such other evidence as he may 
deem necessary may make an order authorizing the owner to repossess and sell 
the unoccupied part of such abandoned lot and apply the proceeds of such sale 
for the perpetual care of the occupied part of such lot .<br>
 (a) This section 
shall apply to every cemetery owned, controlled or managed under the authority 
of any general or special Act.</p> 
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Section 24 of The Cemetery Act as amended by section 4 
of The Cemetery Amendment Act, 1921, is further amended by adding thereto the 
following subsection:<br>
 (3) The council of every county shall appoint one or 
more local inspectors who shall have the duties and powers within the 
municipality of inspectors appointed by the Lieutenant-Governor in Council 
under the 'provisions of section l0a.</p> 
<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This Act shall come into force on the day upon which 
it receives the Royal Assent.</p> 
<p>That is a state or a provincial law. </p> 
<p>Legal decisions perhaps were against some of those things, but with the act 
to back us up and the use of common law on the other questions&mdash;I was 
speaking a moment ago of them&mdash;or the &quot;gift of gab&quot;, and if you 
are able to handle people&mdash;a man may be a civil engineer, a landscape 
artist, a horticulturalist and understand the finer arts of cemetery work, but 
if he does not know how to handle the people and how to induce the people along 
certain lines, he is lacking as a cemetery superintendent, and if you have the 
persuasive, persevering argument you can collect the majority of these finances.
</p> 
<p>Now I would like to tell you about how much money we have collected in 
those two or three years that we have had this in effect. It won't take me a 
minute to read these right over for comparison. Before these questions were 
introduced from 1915 to 1919, there were 507 old lots placed in perpetual care, 
47,215 square feet, with an income of $16,521.25. The following five years, 
after the introduction of this system, and killing the chicken in the usual 
way, we put 1574 lots in perpetual care, or an increase of 1067, an increase of 
102,285 square feet with an increase in revenue of $37,024.41. The first six 
months of the current year we put 273 additional lots in perpetual care, 22,362 
square feet, with $7,831.10 increase in income. During the month of July we put 
54 lots in perpetual care with a revenue of $1,535.10. During the month of 
August, just before leaving I found that the rate was carrying on just the 
same, and if this continues with the addition that after the six months have 
expired of the several thousand lots we advertised under that act, which we 
have the power to resell, and I already have power of attorney from a great 
marry families, not to publish their names and allowing me to sell&mdash;it 
simply means a great proportion of this old finance will be collectible and 
will go into our general fund.</p> 
<p>Now I don't know it all. I am not like the old Quaker that said to his wife 
&quot;The whole world is queer but me and thee and sometimes even thee is a 
little bit queer.&quot; I don't know it all, but this I do know, that our facts 
and our figures and our results show that the methods adopted will collect and 
get us some of that old dead horse finance.</p> 
<p>I have a picture that I brought back from France, and I saw it in actual 
happening in France, when an ammunition column was going up and shells were 
coming over and fell in among the batteries and the ammunition columns, that a 
horse had one leg shot off and ran down the road on three legs. I actually saw 
that, when an old battery man came back and put his arm around the horse's neck 
stopped for a while and said &quot;Good bye, old pal.&quot; The horse was about 
gone, and the boys up the road said &quot;Come on, Bill, come on, Bill.&quot; 
He put his arm around the horse's neck and said &quot;Good bye, old pal,&quot; 
and then left him.</p> 
<p>With these circumstances and conditions we can go into our vault and put 
our hands on our dusty old books that have been lying there a good many years 
and say to the old dead horse finances, &quot;Good bye, old pal.&quot;</p>

<h2>Economy In Starting New Cemeteries</h2>  Date Published:&nbsp;  September, 
1895  Original Author:&nbsp;  Mr. Rhedemeyer  Original Publication:&nbsp;  AACS 
Proceedings of the 9th Annual Convention 
<p>The success of a new cemetery depends upon its location and the way it is 
designed.</p> 
<p>Adopt rules and regulations, have them strictly observed and follow the 
modern plan, for it secures economy and attractiveness. Perpetual care should 
be provided for. One easily makes costly mistakes. The first step is to select 
grounds suitable for a cemetery, using precaution not to get ground with too 
much stone, or that which is low or too near the city. A thorough test should 
be made before deciding on any particular spot. The size of grounds should be 
according to population and surrounding places. It pays to purchase all the 
land you may need in years to come, as interested land holders know how to get 
a price for what could be bought for two-thirds less when first purchased.</p> 
<p>Employ practical help, pay good wages and expect good results. Not many 
weeks ago I was requested to call and see a new cemetery whose owners had paid 
a snug amount to get it started. Upon looking around I discovered four men 
laying out lots in a field with stumps, stories, weeds and ruts (also enjoying 
good cigars). This work was started by a supposed first class engineer and to 
my surprise I found the drives as usual in the best part of the grounds. It is 
a common occurrence to see the mistakes of others and not our own. We do not 
care to conflict with the many so-called landscape engineers, few of them take 
advantage of natural beauty. Practical men should see at a glance what to do 
and how to go about it. Get a lawn or section in use at once, which will help 
curtail the expense. Beautifying the grounds, making lakes, waterfalls, etc., 
may be carried on when nothing urgent is on hand. Do not make your lawns small 
have them large, say from two to three acres in size. Where a smaller cemetery 
is needed, it will look better to have it in small sections, say one to one and 
a half acres to each section. Curves are always attractive; have them liberally 
displayed. When done take measure and stake opposite side for width of drive, 
which should be no less than eighteen feet, if you do make them smaller, the 
public will at once say it is a question of dollars, not beauty. When grading 
allow sufficient fall to carry the water to proper place. Be careful in 
grading. By all means get the ground smooth and shaped before sowing the grass 
seed. Grading is a permanent thing and nothing looks worse than a poorly graded 
place. In doing this use tools best suited for the soil. We at first work the 
scoop, which is drawn by two horses and carries eight cubic feet. When proper 
places are filled in we follow with a scraper eight feet long. This is a simple 
grading device, which does the work to perfection. It is simply an 
old-fashioned road scraper, governed by two men and one driver. With it we can 
accomplish more in one day than six men would in one week.</p> 
<p>When finished harrow the sections thoroughly, pulverizing the soil to 
receive the seed. Lay your border with sod ten feet wide. Select some calm hour 
for sowing, after which apply the best bone fertilizer to be had. By all means 
abolish manure if you wish to have a nice clean lawn. Manure is a good 
fertilizer if plowed under, but great care should be taken not to use it for 
top dressing. Use nothing but Kentucky blue grass, as it gives the prettiest 
effect. When seeded, harrow again after which roll it with a light land, 
roller, and in a few weeks when the grass has appeared roll it again. When 
finished stake out lots to suit location and purchaser. Encourage the purchase 
of large lots, as they are the secret of a pretty cemetery. By all means do so, 
on your best sites. If your demand is greater for small lots select some spot 
where they will not be too conspicuous. Make up your mind to display stone 
yards on them. Allow nothing but good solid stone work; no patent arrangement 
should be allowed, as they are not in harmony with a modern cemetery. Keep your 
place clean, allow no outsider to put in foundation work or set markers. As to 
planting evergreens, trees, shrubs, etc., use precaution. Do not try to get too 
much in one spot. Avoid too close planting. Do not conceive the idea that you 
can succeed by not allowing plants on graves or allowing no mounds. This is too 
premature, our successors in years to come may accomplish this, but with the 
present competition surrounding every cemetery one has to use great care in the 
way things should be governed. Encourage cut flowers, as they are less 
troublesome and pay better than anything from the greenhouse.</p> 
<p>Every cemetery should have its own greenhouses and grow plants and 
cut-flowers for the accommodation of lot holders. This gives pleasure to the 
lot holders, as they like to stroll through a greenhouse and appreciate it if 
properly cared for. Keep it clean. Do not grow anything that has no value. 
Plants of interest are what we want such as Palms, Orchids, Carnations, Roses, 
Violets, Pansies, Forget-me-nots, Specimen Ferns, Smilax and Bedding Plants, 
with a few other good flowering bulbs, as these are the standard varieties. The 
one in command should have full charge of employing, discharging, buying and 
paying all bills, and if anything is wrong he is responsible for it.</p> 
<p>Have your men who attend to the burials provided with proper garments, such 
as men should wear. Do not have them appear like tramps, wearing unsightly 
looking clothes, as if to scare the mourner. Everything should be cheerful.</p>

<h2>The Theoretical System for the Proper Management of Cemetery Employees, 
Team, etc.</h2>  Date Published:&nbsp;  September, 1894  Original Author:&nbsp; 
 H. J. Diering  Original Publication:&nbsp;  AACS Proceedings of the 8th Annual 
Convention 
<p>The theoretical system for the management of cemetery employees is a very 
important feature towards success of a cemetery.</p> 
<p>Employees should be cautioned, and be compelled to show great respect and 
affection to bereaved families, who through loss of their dear ones are 
compelled to visit the cemetery.</p> 
<p>Where employees are rude and harsh, it places great sensitiveness to such 
families and their friends, and naturally creates public comment and complaint 
to the management of such cemeteries, and therefore cemeteries are very liable 
to lose patronage, through advice of their own lot owners to their friends, to 
seek other burial spots in adjacent cemeteries.</p> 
<p>It therefore seems important in taking the first step towards good 
management to train the employees, especially such men as are in change of 
interments to be courteous and spare no pains in pleasing the families at such 
times.</p> 
<p>Cemeteries of large acreage, where interments are numerous and improvements 
are necessary to supply the required demand, a large force of men is required. 
The superintendent at Woodlawn, has the entire control of selecting and 
engaging his men, and will therefore speak of his own experience.</p> 
<p>Theory may be well applied on a general basis; but it seems to me, that the 
same applied to large and small cemeteries, may not prove entirely sufficient, 
and therefore I deem it necessary to apply a certain amount of practical basis, 
as experience or conditions may require.</p> 
<p>At Woodlawn the improving and maintaining the grounds is entirely in the 
hands of the superintendent, and he thinks a very important factor in managing 
employees successfully, is to detail a proper system of branches for the 
various departments required, which should be in charge of a competent foreman. 
Each foreman in charge of his gang of men is held accountable for the expected 
and required work of his men. Each foreman is provided with a time-book to mark 
the time of his force, and on leaving work each day, he must deliver his 
time-book to the superintendent, from which the superintendent enters the time 
on his general book, and there from the payrolls are made. The entire employees 
have to answer roll call at 6:45 a.m. in the presence of the superintendent, 
who then directs each foreman to his respective work. As the superintendent is 
present at roll call and constantly on the grounds, no misuse or favoritism of 
any form can be shown on the part of the foreman in timing his men.</p> 
<p>The following department forces are required: Gravediggers, Maintenance, 
Improvement, Mowing, Gardening, Repair, Stable and Police Forces.</p> 
<p>The Gravedigger force, under a foreman and assistant, with horse carts, are 
required to open graves, attend funerals, excavate foundations and remove all 
surplus earth immediately. Such force is uniformed by the cemetery with black 
cheviot suits and hats to be worn at funerals, also with water proof coats and 
leggings and protected during stormy weather when at work with small grave 
tents. The above force are selected men, among the oldest employees, and are 
strictly cautioned to perform their work, in the most quiet and respectful way.
</p> 
<p>The Maintenance force, under a foreman, is required to keep roads and paths 
in proper order.</p> 
<p>The Improvement force is under a competent foreman with teams in grading 
new sections.</p> 
<p>The Mowing force under a foreman consists of lawn mowers, sickles and 
shears who mow the grass uniformly over the entire grounds during the season.
</p> 
<p>The Gardening force, under a competent gardener, is in charge of the 
bequest lots and the planting of flowers, trees and shrubs.</p> 
<p>The Repair force consists of a blacksmith, carpenter and engineer, who 
build carts, sharpen tools and general repairing, also the shoeing of horses 
and oxen and the running of steam boilers.</p> 
<p>The Stable force consists of stableman and assistants, who are in charge of 
the stock and must meet funerals that come by train with hearse and removals 
within the cemetery.</p> 
<p>Since we have our own stock for teams and carts, we do not hire much, only 
in case of necessity. Certain men are selected who have charge of their teams 
and carts.</p> 
<p>A Police force is organized and uniformed, who protect the grounds and give 
general information to lot owners and visitors. These men are selected from the 
general force, taking the most intelligent and as they are well acquainted with 
the grounds can render good assistance. You will observe that by having various 
departments and each in charge of a foreman with time-book, accurate account 
can be made and given for charging up payrolls to the various accounts.</p> 
<p>The secret of managing a large force of men successfully is to treat them 
right, pay fair wages, and always show them your strict authority. Experience 
shows by such treatment, labor troubles have been avoided and any number of men 
can be obtained when wanted.</p>

<h2>How to Manage a Modern Cemetery</h2>  Date Published:&nbsp;  September, 
1894  Original Author:&nbsp;  Arthur W. Hobert  Lakewood Cemetery, Minneapolis, 
Minnesota  Original Publication:&nbsp;  AACS Proceedings of the 8th Annual 
Convention 
<p>The Committee on program has asked me to discuss the management of a modern 
cemetery, but if I confine myself to telling how we manage Lakewood, in 
Minneapolis, I feel that I will be better able to offer something which will be 
worthy of the attention of the members of the National Association. If, while 
talking about Lakewood, I am able to make suggestions that will be useful to 
gentlemen who are interested in the management of modern cemeteries the purpose 
of this paper will be fulfilled.</p> 
<p>Lakewood is conducted on what is known as the mutual plan, and every lot 
owner is entitled to a vote at the annual election of trustees. All lots are 
sold with a provision for perpetual care, one-fifth of the receipts from these 
sales being placed in the hands of a trust company for that purpose. It seems 
to me, however, that the proper way to create this fund is to estimate the 
amount per foot which will be required at interest to maintain the grounds, and 
set it aside for each foot of ground sold, instead of figuring a percentage of 
sales, as is the rule at Lakewood.</p> 
<p>The management is vested in nine trustees, three of whom are elected 
annually. An executive committee of three is appointed by the president to 
manage the finances, arid have general supervision of ail cemetery work. This 
committee has all the power of a full board and our expenditures must be 
approved by at least one member of it.</p> 
<p>The superintendent has a monthly report blank which contains a statement of 
receipts and expenditures for the month, and for the year-to-date, a copy of 
the trial balance for the past month, and a recapitulation or balance for the 
year-to-date. All accounts of money transactions are kept in the city office, 
together with a set of plats, records of deeds, and lot and interment records. 
At the cemetery is kept a daily interment record, giving name, age, social 
state, nativity, place and date of death, place and date of burial and name of 
undertakers officiating, also, duplicate sets of plats and interment and lot 
owner's records. Our books show in itemized form all sources of income and 
expense, and we are able at any time, by referring to them, to know what 
departments yield a profit. We also itemize our maintenance account daily, 
keeping an accurate record of the time on each kind of work.</p> 
<p>Our sources of income are eight in number, and they may be named in this 
order: Sale of lots, burial fees, single grave fees, special care of flowers, 
building foundations, setting monuments, vault charges and box making.</p> 
<p>Of course, the lot sales are the principal source of income. Prices range 
from fifty cents to one dollar and fifty cents per square foot, according to 
location, the average price as per sales for the past two years being about 
seventy cents. In prosperous times, it should be said however, this average 
would be much higher.</p> 
<p>In a cemetery conducted on the mutual plan, as is Lakewood, the price need 
be set only high enough to pay running expenses, erect and maintain proper 
buildings and secure the amount per foot that is necessary to guarantee 
perpetual care. The prices in some cemeteries are greater than with us, but the 
prices of preparing the ground originally is also greater. Before offering any 
part of a section for sale we grade and plat the entire section, put in heavy 
cast iron corner stones for each lot, and make the price cover the whole. I 
have heard of cemeteries where there was a special charge for grading and 
another charge for posts; and, indeed, until a few years ago that was the 
practice at Lakewood. I think that the plan we are now pursuing is decidedly 
the better.</p> 
<p>The superintendent at Lakewood has a small index book, which he carries in 
his pocket, and which contains, in order, a statement of every lot sold and 
unsold in the cemetery, an alphabetical index of lot owners, and considerable 
other information of value. This book is used in the sale of lots, and we find 
it much more convenient than carrying plats around with us. When a person 
decides to buy a lot we issue him a sale ticket giving date, number of lot, 
price, etc. This ticket is taken to the city office, where the contracts are 
signed and the cash handled. When I assumed control of Lakewood it was the rule 
to make no burials until lots had been fully paid for, but I was not long in 
seeing that such a rule was keeping away many deserving people who otherwise 
would have been our patrons. Accordingly I induced the trustees to try the 
contract system, and I am sure that it has been a success. Our usual terms are 
one-third down, and the balance divided into monthly or quarterly payments 
which draw six percent interest. Such a plan makes it easy for a man in 
moderate circumstances to buy a desirable lot. We have a printed form which 
this class of purchasers sign. Under it we are empowered, in case payments are 
not made promptly, to remove all monumental work and any bodies which may be 
buried in the lots, to lots equaling in value the money that has been paid, 
after deducting the removal expenses.</p> 
<p>Our charges for burial and this includes opening, closing and sodding 
graves, and re-sodding when the dirt settles, are four dollars for persons 
under twelve years of age, and five dollars for persons twelve years or over. 
This is probably as cheap as the work can be done without loss, although I have 
in mind cemeteries where the charges are less. Whether their services are the 
same as ours or not I cannot say.</p> 
<p>In winter all bodies are deposited in the receiving tomb, and for this no 
charge is made, unless they are removed for burial to other cemeteries, or 
remain in the vault after June 1st. from which date a charge is made of two 
dollars per month per body. At the time of deposit in the tomb we make a charge 
to lot owners of the price of burial, which pays for the burial in the spring. 
To persons who are not lot owners we make a charge of the price of a single 
grave, which amount is credited in the spring, if a lot is purchased, or pays 
for a single grave. If a body is removed from our grounds for burial the full 
amount of the deposit is retained.</p> 
<p>During the summer months few bodies are placed in the receiving tomb, and 
those few we require to be sealed in zinc-lined boxes, as is the rule with 
contagious diseases.</p> 
<p>For single graves we charge up to twelve years of age, twelve dollars; 
twelve years of age and over, fifteen dollars. This includes opening closing 
and sodding the grave; and in case a lot is purchased, the amount less the 
burial fee is credited. We allow no individual mounds in the single grave 
section, but instead make the burials in a long tier, the width being the 
length of two graves foot to foot, with a four foot walk at the head depressed 
four inches. Our single grave section receives the same care in every way that 
is given the other parts of the grounds.</p> 
<p>For special care of flowers, watering, etc., we charge $1.50 for each grave 
or vase for the season. This item is a source of some profit to the 
association, and of course the more flowers that are under care the better the 
grounds look.&nbsp; Planting is not allowed on individual lots, except on 
graves and in vases.</p> 
<p>All foundations and other underground work are done by the 
association.&nbsp; Charges for foundations are: twenty cubic feet, or less, 
thirty-five cents per foot; over twenty cubic feet thirty cents. We require 
foundations to be laid under all work larger than 6 x 12 inches. That the 
association should do all work of this sort I consider quite important, for 
contractors will not do it properly, unless an inspector is constantly with 
them. In this connection I will speak of the setting of monuments, for the 
association does the entire monument setting in Lakewood, except in small 
cases. This requires one good man, accustomed to handling ropes and to 
directing men, but the other help can be common labor. By setting our monuments 
we are saved a great deal of annoyance, and realize a profit besides. 
Contractors allowed in cemeteries to do such work are chronic borrowers. They 
want ropes, blocks, planks, bars and numerous other things, in a great many 
cases forgetting to return them. The result is that when you need them a grand 
hunt is in order.&nbsp; Contractors also seem to take a delight in hitching guy 
ropes to trees and in many ways they are great nuisances in a well regulated 
cemetery.</p> 
<p>Nearly all of the pine boxes used in Lakewood is furnished by the 
association. As many of our funerals are arranged by telephone, this is a great 
convenience to us and to the undertaker. It saves the latter a trip from the 
city with a box while we can take the box direct to the grave and put men to 
work, knowing that we have the proper dimensions. Our box account last year 
paid for nearly all the lumber that was used at the cemetery, and had a credit 
of about two hundred dollars besides. We buy the sides and ends sawed to size 
and saw the tops and bottoms on the grounds. &quot;Rainy day work&quot; is what 
we call box making, for whenever it rains hard enough to interfere with the 
regular routine, the teamsters and other employees who are paid by the month, 
turn in to make boxes.</p> 
<p>There are minor sources of income, not mentioned in this paper, but it is 
scarcely worth while taking up your time to name them.</p> 
<p>The common laborers in the grounds are directly under a foreman who looks 
to the superintendent for instructions. He hires and discharges his own men, 
and I think this is the best plan, for when men know that a foreman has 
absolute authority over them their respect for him will increase and the 
character of their work will improve. The mechanics, watchmen and other 
assistants are hired by the superintendent, who looks after them in person. All 
work is itemized daily, so that at any time we can know exactly what any piece 
of work is costing us.</p> 
<p>We have no special set of men for grave digging, or mowing, but accustom 
the employees to all kinds of labor, in this way being prepared for any 
emergency.</p> 
<p>The hours for keeping the grounds open are 7:00 a.m. to 8:30 p.m. during 
the summer months; late in the fall and during the winter the gates are closed 
at 5:30 or 6 o'clock in the evening.</p> 
<p>As is the case in many cemeteries, we have as yet been unable to bring 
about all of the reforms suggested by the association members. But we are 
slowly working toward improved conditions and hope to do better in the future. 
I think that you will find that where a large city cemetery is behind the 
times, it is more frequently the fault of the lot owners, than of the cemetery 
management, for every important reform is contested inch by inch.</p> 
<p>It is quite possible that in this somewhat hurried account of how business 
is done at Lakewood I have told little that is new. The principal good coming 
from these annual meetings is the exchange of ideas that they encourage; each 
member being invited to bring the best that he has, and exhibit it for the 
benefit of his neighbor, to the end that the neighbor, if he sees fit may 
profit by it or offer suggestions that may be a source of profit to others. It 
is in this spirit that I came before you today, hoping, that if I am not able 
to be of any special service to you in what I have said you may be of service 
to me in the discussions that are to follow.</p>

<h2>Construction and Maintenance of Roads</h2>  Date Published:&nbsp;  
September, 1894  Original Author:&nbsp;  Manton E. Hibbs  Original 
Publication:&nbsp;  AACS Proceedings of the 8th Annual Convention 
<p>There seems to be at present a great awakening allover the United States on 
the question of road construction and maintenance. With this awakening, there 
has been launched upon the reading public by newspapers and tracts almost as 
much ignorance or knowledge misapplied as real knowledge. This has led to the 
employment of men who have neither the technical skill nor the practical 
appreciation for the subject in hand. Now whether it is always best to 
economize on the first cost of all engineering, namely the salary of the 
engineer, is a question open to debate. Some practical men, no doubt, can 
dispense with a civil engineer. Yet to the economist as well as to the 
practical man, the civil engineer can be of a great help and service. Therefore 
my first note of warning is employ a civil engineer to do your engineering work 
on roads. It will pay at the finish.</p> 
<p>In all arts as well as sciences there apparently seems a conflict between 
the theoretical and practical sides of all questions: On the question of roads 
the art has so well blended in the science that there is very little, 
practically speaking, difference between them. To thoroughly understand all 
sides of the question we must of necessity be acquainted with many things, 
essential and non-essential. We hope tonight to give, however, rather a running 
summary of what might be termed the best essentials of road making in their 
application to all roads. In order to make ourselves a trifle clear on that 
subject, we might say a word on the non-essential. Much stress has been laid on 
the requirement that the descending grade shall not exceed angle of repose of 
the wheel but had we only two iron rails with freight cars the question would 
be comparatively speaking, an easy one for solution. But look what we have on 
any street or road, variation in the width of every tire, different sizes of 
the wheels and axles, state of lubrication and amount of load, which, together 
with wet, dry or frosty condition of the surface of the road prevent even an 
average solution of the problem. Experiments on traction therefore for this 
reason must give way before practical and actual experience.</p> 
<p>In our opening sentence, we discussed the first essential, namely, the 
employment of competent engineers. The other essentials naturally group 
themselves under three heads: 1st, Laying out of the Road; 2nd, its 
Construction; 3rd, its Maintenance.</p> 
<p><strong>Laying out of the Road</strong></p> 
<p>Most of laying out of the road properly belong to the field. Before 
starting out on a survey, it would be best to thoroughly understand just what 
amount of money is appropriated and the character of the road to be built. A 
stone covered road can stand a heavier grade than a dirt one. A paved gutter 
can carry off water quicker than a dirt one.</p> 
<p>A few hints from railroads may not come here amiss. Branch Railroads carry 
greater grades with fewer facilities than the Main lines. Most of our highways 
were laid out along property lines and we cannot always regulate the traffic as 
on a railroad. Yet nevertheless for any series of road, they should be laid out 
in a system, and the proper grades should be fixed accordingly.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>If directness is wanted, get a straight line. Often a curved road will 
answer the purpose of a straight one and make up for its increase in length by 
its appropriateness and the lessening of its grades. In the matter of curves, 
never go below a fifty-foot radius, equalize the radii of compound curves as 
much as possible, put a tangent between reverse curves; these are about the 
only things of practical importance with regard to line questions.</p> 
<p><strong>Grades</strong></p> 
<p>In all cases, fix a maximum grade. As we have just said, a scientific 
solution of this question is beyond us. Hence we must seek experience and 
observation. Men naturally walk slowly up hill and quickly down hill while 
horses do the reverse. Consequently it would seem that the grade that would 
admit of the highest speed down hill would be the proper one to select. A grade 
of 1 in 30 for mixed traffic is about as near a solution as can be reached to 
this problem. A grade of one in twenty may do but one in thirty is nearer the 
average.</p> 
<p>Also it is not always the traffic that will determine your grades. Remember 
your drainage all depends on your grade. A grade of one in twenty is apt to 
cause considerable damage in a heavy rain storm.</p> 
<p>Avoid level stretches as there should be sufficient fall to carry off all 
surface water quickly otherwise, soft muddy spots will abound. As we have just 
cited a maximum grade we likewise have a minimum one. For paved gutter, 0.2 
percent per 100 and 1 in 120 for unpaved, are the grades, and these grades 
should be limits in such cases.</p> 
<p>Compensate on all curves. These might all seem trifles at first yet they 
never cost any more when put in effect, and in the end, decrease the cost of 
maintenance.</p> 
<p><strong>Drainage</strong></p> 
<p>Drainage can next claim our attention. Too much importance cannot be 
attached to this subject. The worst enemies to out door structures are frost 
and water. If we draw away the latter, we can render the former ineffective. 
With the absence of water, we have less mud and also less dust as the stones 
having no chance to loosen, are not apt to break up into dirt and fragments.</p>
<p>Drainage naturally falls under two heads, surface and sub-drainage. 
Sub-drainage as we shall see later on is not absolutely necessary except in 
very wet soils, for a stone covered road; but on clay and earth road 
sub-drainage is absolutely indispensable. The crown, although it maybe steep, 
yet cannot possibly get rid of all the water into the side ditches. The 
remainder must gradually evaporate under the action of sun and wind. Hence the 
liability of frost. The French or blind drains are the best for this purpose 
and should always be located below the frost line. Most of the authorities 
agree that 3&quot; unglazed tiles with loose collars with a covering to 
sub-grade of gravel, small stones, road metal or broken bricks are the best 
means for such drains. Trees as you all know grow as much under ground as 
overhead with the difference that instead of seeking the light as the branches 
naturally do, the roots drift towards moisture. The trees must be gotten rid of 
as they will continually block the drains. Keep your tiles to a uniform grade 
with the proper outlets open and then leave the rest to Heaven for you can do 
no more.</p> 
<p>Surface drainage must be provided in every case. This is partly affected by 
crowning the road, so as to throw the water into the side ditches or drains. 
Beyond merely mentioning this, so as to bring it under its proper head we will 
leave this for a time only to refer to later on. Bridges and culverts which 
naturally fall under this heading would demand too much space and time for our 
short paper.</p> 
<p><strong>Road Surface</strong></p> 
<p>The road next claims our attention. Contractors don't like to remove old 
stumps for nothing, and sometimes, if things can be covered up, so much the 
better. This is the reason of convenience and not sense as it eventually 
appears at the end. The base of all masonry rests below the frost line. In road 
construction this cannot always be done. The metal portion, if possible, should 
never rest on the ordinary surface as, the top soil is generally too porous and 
never compacted. Hence excavate about one foot below the natural surface and 
remove all stumps, brush, vegetable matter and rocks. Fill the resulting holes 
with suitable material, tamp and bring the surface to a proper grade by 
rolling.&nbsp; This surface should exactly correspond to the section of the 
metal portion. If on excavating treacherous or unsuitable material is found, it 
should be removed immediately and proper means substituted.</p> 
<p><strong>Road Bed</strong></p> 
<p>All authorities seem to agree on two points; the convexity of the road and 
the width of the metal portion. This convexity should always be greater or 
equal in grade to the longitudinal grade of the road, so as to avoid 
longitudinal flow of water. This cannot always be, for the greater the 
convexity, the more the tendency will be to drive in the centre which will soon 
wear the surface into ruts. Hence we must compromise. One in thirty for a metal 
road and one in twenty for dirt, for owing to its porosity, will fulfill most 
requirements.</p> 
<p>On the width the multiple of 8 is best as this width gives ample play of 
all wagons and carriages.</p> 
<p>What we have given before applies to all roads. Under the subject of road 
structure we will only take up, in a rather hasty sketch, what is really the 
best to satisfy all traffic. The Macadam Telford Road seems to satisfy these 
conditions best.</p> 
<p>The Macadam Telford road is made up of two distinct portions, a uniform 
foundation of large stones which likewise act as a blind drain, and a 
superstructure of smaller stones acting as a durable water tight roof. Now, 
this distinction ought to be clearly made and thoroughly understood. A 
foundation and a superstructure, the former is never expected to wear out which 
the latter is expected to eventually.</p> 
<p>The foundation, acting also as blind drain, should be porous but not 
pervious to water. It should never exceed 8&quot; in depth for beyond this it 
is not possible to get a good bond. The foundation stones should be any tough 
durable stone about 8&quot; in depth and 6 to 8&quot; in width. They should be 
closely laid by hand on their broadest edge lengthwise across the road. All 
projecting points should be broken off, and the interstices filled with stone 
chips wedged by a hammer until the foundation presents an even surface of 
8&quot; in depth.</p> 
<p>Upon this surface, the superstructure rests. The lower portion of this 
wearing coat should be of hard durable trap rock fragments whose longest 
dimensions should be able to, pass a 2&frac12;&quot; ring. Machine broken stone 
is preferable as the edges of the fragments are apt to be sharper, and the 
screenings are the best for the top dressings. No gravel or round fragments 
should be tolerated, for even if it is possible to secure a bond with such, 
there is always the probability that the stones will eventually roll and work 
loose. The first layer should be 2&frac12;&quot; thick and thoroughly rolled if 
possible. Another layer 1&frac12;&quot; in depth of fragments 1&quot; in 
diameter rests upon the first layer. After, being well watered a cover of fine 
trap rock screenings is added and rolled into the road as a binder until the 
surface becomes a hard water proof covering. It is absolutely necessary to keep 
the road well sprinkled under the action of the roller. The steam roller per 
inch run approaches the nearest, to the heaviest load per inch run of the 
vehicles and is preferred for this reason above horse roller. It should weigh 
not less than 5 tons. With regard to the rolling of binder the proper time to 
stop is when the fragments are apt to be crushed under the weight without being 
pressed into the road surface while for the other courses, the stones should 
not creep before the roller.</p> 
<p><strong>Maintenance</strong></p> 
<p>Having now got possession of your road give it a name, put up a few 
signboards so as to tell the people where it is, and on this board, likewise 
place a few numbers signifying the miles from some starting point. This is a 
great convenience and help. The maintenance of the roads seems to be a 
stumbling block to most systems. To some, the word maintenance, means in most 
cases, to clean out the side ditches, throw the refuse in the middle of the 
road and trust the rest to heaven and the driver. It matters not whether much 
or little is spent for road repairs, unless the repairing is done under a 
system, the road and your expense account is going to suffer. The system best 
adapted is called the continual repair system. Men do not allow a rent to 
remain in a coat for any length of time especially if the coat is wanted for 
service. They mend immediately, according to the nursery rhyme &quot;a stitch 
in time saves nine.&quot; So with roads, fill up the ruts, remove the stones 
and sweep off the dust continually as fast as they are made and your road will 
always appear well and in good condition. Large amount of repairing should be 
done in the spring and autumn when there is plenty of rain. Also at that time 
there should be a good overhauling of the whole drainage system. Inlets and 
gutters cleaned out, weeds raked out and everything put in shape for the winter 
snows and rains. Briefly in conclusion or let me summarize a few facts that 
seem to be of value that we have tried to go over this evening:</p>

<h2>Perpetual Care of Lots</h2>  Date Published:&nbsp;  August, 1893  Original 
Author:&nbsp;  T. McCarthy  Original Publication:&nbsp;  AACS Proceedings of 
the 7th Annual Convention 
<p>The necessity and importance of making some provision for the perpetual 
care of cemeteries is now so fully recognized and appreciated throughout the 
country that it is gratifying to know that the increasing interest and 
admirable results already obtained owe very much to the influence and 
intelligent efforts of this association. Such progress is surely sufficient 
excuse for our existence and some compensation for the labor and expense in 
attending these annual conventions.</p> 
<p>A burial ground (says a writer) unprotected and neglected, presents a 
cheerless and sad spectacle. It would seem that the dead who lie in such a 
place had been strangely forgotten by the living, and that philosophy is cold 
and repulsive which teaches us that the body being an insensible mass of matter 
may be buried from our sight and never thought of any more, and so inseparably 
do we connect the feelings and character of the living with the appearance and 
condition of the place of their dead that Franklin's saying is applicable, 
&quot;I only need to visit the burial ground of a community to know the 
character of the people.&quot;&nbsp; Hence no cemetery or burial ground today 
is complete or satisfactory which does not show not only evidences of care and 
respect paid by individuals and families to the memory of their own dead, but 
evidences also of that respect which the community of the living should ever 
bear toward the community of the dead.</p> 
<p>Now, while I cannot hope to enhance the importance of this subject, it may 
be well to call attention to the diversity of opinions and of practice that 
prevails as to the best method of securing perpetual care, and as the charges 
and application of this vary in different cemeteries, I have no desire to 
recommend a fixed scale of prices for all cemeteries, or any &quot;best 
plan.&quot; In my opinion each cemetery must be governed by the local 
conditions and advantages of its section of the country, such as the rate of 
interest, the cost of labor and materials, condition of the soil, severity of 
the climate, etc., or the exacting taste of your respective communities. All 
these and many other considerations will govern somewhat the cost of perpetual 
care. I might say here that the words &quot;perpetual care&quot; (although as 
smooth and consoling as a life insurance policy) are too broad and often 
misleading, and seemingly promise more care than the interest of the fund or 
money left will admit.</p> 
<p>The original intention and meaning of perpetual care in my vicinity 
included the care of the grass only, and I hear of many disappointments because 
myrtle graves, watering vases, cleaning headstones, etc., are not included. Of 
course all these can be provided for by increasing the fund and it would be 
well to have all such things definitely stated in the bond or contract made 
between the proprietor and the corporation and thus avoids many 
misunderstandings in the future.</p> 
<p>In my opinion, there are only two or three things connected with a burial 
lot, the care of which should be included and provided for, viz. the good 
appearance of the grass and all hardy shrubs and trees, and the cleaning and 
permanent position of head-stones and monuments. Many other items, some of a 
perishable existence and doubtful taste, could be readily dispensed with, and 
we continually discourage perpetuating flower beds (excepting hardy subjects) 
myrtle graves, vases and the care of hedges, fences, etc.</p> 
<p>New cemeteries have no great difficulty in adopting perpetual care, at 
least for the grass and good appearance of the grounds, but these remarks are 
intended more for the older cemeteries which it is desirable to rescue from 
dilapidation and neglect, many lots and ground sold years ago, or before 
perpetual care was thought of.</p> 
<p>To accomplish this, and before appealing to proprietors to leave money for 
the care of their respective grounds, the cemetery or corporation should do its 
part and give some assurance of greater neatness and higher keeping of the 
grounds, and thus secure the confidence and respect of the public.</p> 
<p>When perpetual care was adopted in the cemetery under my charge, and when 
it was understood that dilapidation and neglect would no longer be tolerated, 
our sales perceptibly increased, and that too to citizens already owning lots 
in the numerous cemeteries in our vicinity, so that it is very evident that the 
greater the assurance a cemetery offers against such neglect, not only for our 
day, but for the future as far as human foresight can suggest, the more surely 
will it provide what the public demand, the greater will be its success and the 
higher will what it has to offer for sale be valued.</p> 
<p>In all the catalogues and reports kindly sent me by brother 
superintendents, only one has a printed scale of prices for Perpetual Care. 
Spring Grove, Cincinnati, although all make an urgent appeal to their lot 
owners to leave money, the interest of which will be faithfully applied to the 
care of their respective lots. So for lack of knowledge of its workings and 
application in other cemeteries, and without any egotism, or comparison with 
older or wealthier institutions, a brief allusion to its adoption and progress 
at least, financially, in the cemetery under my charge, may be acceptable.</p> 
<p>Swan Point was consecrated in 1847, and perpetual care was not adopted till 
1877. During those 30 years many proprietors left money, by will or otherwise, 
and many more who were able and could have done so, but by their delay and the 
reverses of fortune they have been prevented from making this provision for 
themselves and their families. Suffice it to say that since the adoption of 
perpetual care the amount received in anyone year exceeded the voluntary 
contributions of the first 30 years.</p> 
<p>The increase for each year is as follows: </p>

<p>The above may encourage many cemeteries contemplating Perpetual Care, 
although I know from experience how difficult and remote the accumulation of 
funds of one or two hundred thousand dollars seems on such small beginnings, 
and without even &quot;a silver lining to every cloud,&quot; but don't be 
discouraged. In the language of statesmen, &quot;the only way to resume is to 
resume.&quot;</p> 
<p>About this time a scale of prices was adopted having reference to the care 
of the grass only. This was headed &quot;Perpetual Care of Lots,&quot; and was 
mailed to the older proprietors as a guide and reminder to place their lots 
under care, and thus look like the newer sections.</p> 
<p>The printing and distribution of this scale of prices was, I think, a 
mistake, as it deceived many who intended to provide for everything, when by 
will or otherwise they left only sufficient to care for the grass. The better 
way would be for the lot owner or his representative making this provision to 
visit the cemetery, see the condition of his lot; state what he desires to 
provide for and obtain the proper information from the superintendent, and with 
all due respect for cemetery officials, he is the proper one to consult.</p> 
<p>Scale of prices for perpetual care of grass only: <br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;..&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1,100 square feet

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1,200 square feet 
&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip; 300</p> 
<p>For lots containing over 1,200 feet, 25&cent; per square foot </p> 
<p>When the above scale was adopted, some 16 years ago, the basis of our 
reckoning was 6%. Last year these funds earned only 5% and they are likely to 
realize still less in the future. So with the rates of interest decreasing and 
wages, etc., increasing, it may be a question if our scale of prices is not too 
low, but I will leave this to the convention, and as I said before, each 
cemetery will be governed by the conditions and advantages of its own section 
and people.</p> 
<p>While the moneys or funds of cemeteries may be under various headings and 
not always intelligible, I would suggest at least two funds: A perpetual care 
fund, which has reference to private lots only, and a permanent fund, the 
interest of which would be sufficient to care for all the property of the 
cemetery and meet expenses when there is no further income from the sale of 
land.&nbsp;&nbsp; This fund should be absolutely fixed and as carefully guarded 
as the perpetual care fund. The method of its accumulation may vary, but the 
principal with the yearly additions and interest should be allowed to 
accumulate for a long number of years or till the land which created them is 
all sold. I think this fund is of vital importance, but I am anxious to make 
improvements in my day and so would like to leave its creation to my successor.
</p> 
<p>In conclusion, gentlemen, our Association must be true to this Gospel of 
Perpetual Care. We know how pleasant and easy it is to receive people's money, 
and how uncertain and difficult it is to carry out the obligations assumed, 
especially in our severe and eccentric climate, but we must keep faith with the 
people, and secure to our citizens at least a burial place, indicating not only 
respect for the dead, but which will also be a source of pride and consolation 
to the living.</p>

<h2>Location, Construction and Drainage of Roads in Cemeteries</h2>  Date 
Published:&nbsp;  September, 1892  Original Author:&nbsp;  Matthew P. Brazill  
Calvary Cemetery, St. Louis, Missouri  Original Publication:&nbsp;  AACS 
Proceedings of the 6th Annual Convention 
<p>The subject of cemetery roads has been discussed in three papers read at 
the conventions held at Brooklyn, Boston and Detroit by some of our most 
experienced members, and hundreds of books have been written by engineers from 
time to time, on roads generally. Still the subject is open for discussion as a 
matter of primary importance.<br>
 &nbsp;<br>
 We may view it from different 
standpoints and try to throw new light on the subject according to our various 
experiences, but we have all to be governed by those well established 
principles laid down and in use by our predecessors. This paper, though not 
intended to enlighten our experienced members, is offered as an addition to the 
records of our Association, to assist the young and new members on entering 
into our profession, to guide them in the location, construction and surface 
drainage of roads in cemeteries. It is the result of personal experience and 
practice, as also an endorsement of the papers already written for the 
Association mentioned above, and which I would recommend to our young members 
to read carefully, as they contain many useful hints which are the result of 
long experience, and prepared by very competent gentlemen.</p> 
<p>In the location of roads, the cemetery superintendent has two schools to 
study from, the landscape engineer and the real estate man. The first is a 
sentimental character, with more or less of romance in his makeup, who seeks 
out the most beautiful and romantic routes, with a view of producing the best 
landscape effects; while the latter is a close observer, studying how he is to 
lay out his ground so as to get the most money out of it.</p> 
<p>For the location of roads, the study of the landscaper is his principal 
model, but always bearing in mind the influence of this location on the value 
of lots. We sometimes find a serious mistake made in having too many roads. In 
this, a great deal of ground is wasted and a great deal of unnecessary expense 
incurred in construction and maintenance, and the whole plan is unsightly and 
un-picturesque. The fewer roads the better, consistent with the proper 
development of the grounds.</p> 
<p>As this is not the place to discuss the art of landscaping, we will suppose 
our superintendent is already familiar with that beautiful study before he 
attempts to lay out cemetery roads, otherwise he is very apt to blunder in the 
locations, and ought employ some gentleman of experience to do this work for 
him, as so much depends on the harmony of the two. In flat or level grounds, 
locations are easier than in rolling or undulating grounds.<br>
 &nbsp;<br>
 We 
will commence our locations from the entrance. This road should be straight for 
a few hundred feet, as conveniences will permit, and not less than forty feet 
wide, and in large and much frequented cemeteries, where a large number of 
funerals is the rule, fifty feet wide will be an improvement.&nbsp; A wide road 
at the entrance, a well-kept lawn on either side with groups of flowers or 
shrubs and a background of ornamental trees has a very imposing effect. This is 
the frontispiece to the cemetery, making what is called, a first good 
impression. After leaving this main avenue the roads should deflect in graceful 
curves, dividing the grounds into sections, three or four hundred feet wide at 
their widest points. Smaller sections are a mistake. Short, sharp curves should 
never be used except to connect two large curves. Regular curves should also be 
avoided, as they remind us of the railroad and are too mathematical for rural 
purposes. What the engineer terms a compound curve is generally used in parks 
and cemeteries. We must also avoid the too frequent changing of direction, as 
it gives a zigzag and confusing impression. Sometimes a short curve or change 
is necessary, when we want to produce some agreeable surprise, for effect, in 
the landscape. But as a general rule the long graceful curve is the best for 
appearance, and makes the best border for lots.</p> 
<p>In studying curves, let us take those that nature furnishes us with, such 
as the leaves of trees and flowers, the undulation of natural hills, and we 
have grace and beauty and variety. As we are to produce rural effects, let us 
study rural models. Valley roads look well, as the ground slopes upward on 
either side, which is very desirable for lots, and looking down on them from 
the crest of the hill, the effect is picturesque. There is economy in occupying 
these all up with roads, though it may not be al ways best for the landscape. 
To layout roads, having decided where your road is to be located, drive a stake 
at every one or two hundred feet apart, on the line of the intended route. 
Having satisfied yourself that these stakes mark the principal points you want 
to pass through, complete your line with stakes driven twenty or twenty-five 
feet apart. Look up and down your line from both ends until you are satisfied 
you have the curve laid down that you intended, and that the stakes are placed 
at equal distances, for this is important, otherwise the eye will be deceived 
by irregular distances. The centre line being now complete, measure half the 
width of the road to the right and left from the stakes, for the sides. You 
will generally find that some of these side stakes are out of curve. This is 
caused by not getting the correct right angle distance from the point of 
tangent, hook along your side lines as you did along your centre line, and by 
changing a few stakes the curve will be easily adjusted. Some parties recommend 
the laying out of one side line first. This is a mistake. Engineers layout the 
centre line first, and they are the best authority. It is easier to study and 
form a conception of one line than of two. Get one right and the others must 
follow as parallels. It is impossible to formulate rules to meet all the little 
difficulties that may arise in locations. But the foregoing general rules may 
be followed with safety.</p> 
<p>With regard to laying out roads with instruments; this may apply in laying 
out regular curves, such as railroads, etc., but they are practically of no use 
in laying out cemetery roads. A trained eye and a metallic tapeline are very 
essential in this work.</p> 
<p>CONSTRUCTION</p> 
<p>Having located your road, the next step is the grading and construction. 
The grade of a road is controlled entirely by the surrounding grounds. If the 
ground is level the grade must follow the surrounding surface with sufficient 
clay removed to make room for the material of which the road is to be made. The 
crown or center of the road, when finished, should be on the same level as the 
surrounding lawn, with an incline on the sides to form water tables or gutters. 
Flat roads do not look well. A slight roll or curve in the cross section looks 
best even in walks. Again, flat roads retain the water which collects in little 
pools, and tend to wear out the road quickly.</p> 
<p> In flat, or nearly flat grades, about one or two in a hundred feet, the 
incline in the cross section should be one-third of an inch to a foot; while in 
steep grades of about four feet to a hundred, the cross-section should be half 
an inch to a foot. This increase in the curve of the cross-section is necessary 
in order to throw the water from heavy rains to the sides, which would 
otherwise run down the center of the road, making what are called ruts, which 
soon destroy the surface coating. The reverse of this rule is the practice in 
street paving and for very good reasons.</p> 
<p>In rolling grounds where steep grades are frequent, the grade cannot follow 
the rule as in flat lawns. After deciding on an easy and judicious grade, the 
surrounding grounds must be graded down to conform to the roadway, with 
gracefully sloping borders on either side. Abrupt terraces must be avoided 
where possible, if lots are to be sold on the road front. If only used for 
landscape effect or for vaults, then abrupt terraces are ornamental. Abrupt 
terraces with angular edges are not to be recommended, but rather a gracefully 
curved slope. As nearly all cemetery grading is done by cemetery men and teams, 
it will not be necessary to go into the computation of quantities for grading. 
Sometimes the sub-grade, or clay surface, is shaped to the same curve as the 
finished roadway is to have. This is perhaps the most economical plan. Again 
the sub-grade is made flat, and the curved surface is formed by making the 
stonework higher in the centre and decreasing to the sides.&nbsp; It is well 
before putting on the road material, to roll the sub-grade, so as to get it as 
compact as possible to receive the stone, filling in any hollows or 
irregularities which usually show on the surface after the rolling. This also 
gets the sub-grade in uniform condition. Some difference of opinion exists as 
to the weight of rollers. Those in general use now, for making streets, are not 
our five-tons and hauled by four horses; steam rollers are considered too heavy 
except in special cases. Steam rollers can be made any size or weight. I have 
seen some this season, at the Chicago World's Fair grounds, for rolling walks, 
and they were not larger than an ordinary sized baby buggy. Experienced men 
agree that it is better to roll a road frequently, or for an extra length of 
time, with a light roller, than roll it a few times with a very heavy one.</p> 
<p>There are so many kinds of material that enter into the construction of 
roads, that it is impossible to mention them all here. The principal mode of 
construction most used in cemeteries, is generally known as the Telford plan. 
This has been well treated by Mr. Trangs, in his paper read at the convention 
held at Boston in 1890. There are various ways of treating this plan in the 
construction of roads; according to the means and necessities of the cemetery. 
The ordinary mode is to lay a rough paving of stone, from six to ten inches 
deep, breaking off the rough corners with a hammer, and filling in the holes on 
the surface with spalls or broken stone until you produce a tolerably even 
surface. This is the Telford foundation. In first-class roads it is customary 
to put different layers of broken stone, varying from four inches to a fine 
crushed stone about the size of ordinary gravel, and rolling each layer well as 
it is put on. Some of the driving roads in the northern part of New York City 
were made in this way. This may be too expensive, and is certainly not 
necessary in cemeteries.</p> 
<p>A modified form of the Telford macadam plan will be found to serve all the 
requirements for cemeteries. A Telford foundation, a coat of macadam from two 
to three inches in size, about four or six inches thick, and a top dressing of 
sandy loam and gravel well rolled. Gravel makes the best top dressing. It is to 
a road what varnish is to a carriage. It gives a fine finish and preserves the 
undercoating. The whole construction of roads might be expressed in a few 
words. Secure a good foundation, it is as necessary to a road as a footing 
course is to a wall and fills a similar office. Take good care of your top 
dressing by renewing, rolling and sprinkling, and the work is done.</p> 
<p>The necessity for heavy material is twofold in some climates. First, to 
carry heavy traffic and resist wear and tear on thoroughfares or principal 
roads; and second, to resist the upheavals caused by thawing frost in the early 
spring. Higher roads might serve the purpose in cemeteries with little traffic, 
and not much subject to upheavals of frost in spring.</p> 
<p>SURFACE DRAINAGE</p> 
<p>As the nature of the soil has a great deal to do with the system of 
drainage to be adopted, it will be subject to changes according to location and 
circumstances. In sandy and gravelly soils the drainage is simple and 
inexpensive. The gravel beds acting as an outlet for surface water, while in 
clay soils it is more difficult and expensive, as the surface water has to be 
carried away through a regulated system of pipes and inlets. In gravel soil, a 
system of open catch-basins might be adopted, as described by Mr. Lovering, in 
his paper read at the Detroit convention, and in use at Mt. Auburn, Boston. In 
clay soil a graduated system of drain pipe must be laid, connecting with inlets 
at various distances apart, according to the roadway, and the greatest rainfall 
of the district. Engineers use formulas for calculating the size of pipes used 
in drainage in proportion to the average rainfall, and the grade and area of 
the surrounding surface, but this rule cannot be adopted in cemeteries, as it 
usually gives a result too small for cemetery purposes. Cemetery pipes have to 
carry a good deal of debris, such as cut grass, leaves, etc., consequently, due 
allowance must be made for this. The smallest pipe used should not be less than 
nine inches, gradually increasing the size according to the distance from the 
outlet. It is better to err on the side of large pipes, than to have the system 
choked by using them too small. The difference in price is very little, 
compared with the labor and annoyance attendant on cleaning away and relaying a 
blocked system which invariably results from using small pipes.&nbsp; We have 
to deal with clay soil here in St. Louis, and a proper drainage system requires 
a special study. This may apply to other parts of the country. We must always 
adopt short lines, if possible, if we can get convenient outlets, as pipe 
laying is expensive and we must be economical consistent with an effective 
system. The location and size of inlets and the use of pipes and roads depends 
principally on the grade. In flat grades, they might be dispensed with, or at 
least, used at long intervals, while in steep grades they are necessary from 
one to two hundred feet apart. Inlets are usually built of brick or stone, with 
cement mortar. Sometimes iron castings are made to serve the purpose, but the 
simplest and most inexpensive I have seen is made of vitrified drain pipe, and 
which is known in the trade as a &quot;reducer.&quot; It is made bell-shaped, 
and can be made any size to suit circumstances The pipes used here are from 
twelve to eighteen inches on the inside of the flange, reducing to six or nine 
inches at the smaller end to connect with the regular line of pipe by means of 
a T joint or a curve. It is simply an inverted pipe with the flange side turned 
upward, carrying an iron gratin g that fits inside of the flange. The objection 
to this inlet is that it has to be placed in a recess off the gutter, to 
prevent it being broken by heavy carriages, though it will stand some rough 
usage, and bear considerable weight. Small sizes are useful in draining walks. 
Some cemeteries use brick inlets with stone caps.&nbsp; The best design of this 
class is in use at Spring Grove, Cincinnati. These classes of inlets are too 
conspicuous and are more objectionable than the ordinary grating. Gratings 
should be made strong enough to stand ordinary traffic of carriages, say 
three-fourths of an inch thick and at least two inches apart, to prevent them 
from being choked up with debris.</p> 
<p>Gutters are used a good deal in some cemeteries for surface drainage. Some 
few use them on all their roads, as they think they are ornamental by marking 
and preserving the alignment of the roads, and protecting the borders from 
careless drivers, while preventing washes on steep grades. While I admit the 
use of them in steep grades, they might be dispensed with on flat grades, as a 
neatly trimmed grass border or lawn road looks more rural and natural than the 
artificial gutter. They are usually paved with cobble stone in gravel 
districts, while in clay districts, where limestone, etc., are generally used, 
they are paved with thin stone from two to four inches thick, and eight to 
twelve inches long. Where the stone is carefully dressed, and the paving well 
done in graceful lines, it is not objectionable, but rather agreeable; but a 
rough gutter, badly paved, has a very bad effect, and at first sight you wish 
you never saw it. Another objection to gutters is the expense in construction 
and keeping them free from weeds. The latter objection is removed if the paving 
is done on coal cinders and the joints granted with cement. Some recommend salt 
or lime, but I have found this to fail very often, especially so in wet 
weather, besides it is expensive if it has to be used over a large area, or for 
any length of time. Granitoid gutters are now most in use in our parks, and 
will be soon introduced into cemeteries.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Gutters in cemeteries and parks are paved from eighteen to twenty-four 
inches wide on a bed of sand or cinders twelve inches deep, they usually have a 
dish of two or three inches, according to width. Where cinders can be obtained, 
they are the best for paving as they do not encourage vegetation as sand does. 
The cinders at the bottom of the trench might be coarse, but the cinders to 
receive the paving must be screened from four to six inches in depth.</p> 
<p>HITCHING POSTS</p> 
<p>A word on hitching posts, as they are a part of the furniture of a roadway; 
a few of our cemeteries are fortunate enough in having a very select class of 
patrons, and can afford to dispense with hitching posts altogether. This is 
best unfortunately the great majority of our cemeteries find them a necessity, 
and make the mistake of having too many of them and too large in size, which 
makes them disagreeably conspicuous. The simplest and most appropriate I have 
seen are in use at Graceland, Chicago. They are made of two-inch gas pipe, 
about two feet six inches high, with a ring for hitching, on top. The post is 
leaded into a stone about twelve inches cube, and covered under the surface. 
Another is a dressed block of stone about twelve inches cube with a ring 
attached. This can be moved from one part of the road to another and away from 
the borders.</p> 
<p>When at Chicago last year, I asked one of our old experienced members what 
he thought of the hitching posts used at Graceland, and he answered that he did 
not notice any. This is just the desirable result. Hitching posts should be as 
inconspicuous as possible.</p>

<h2>First Experiences in Cemetery Management</h2>  Date Published:&nbsp;  
September, 1892  Original Author:&nbsp;  Mr. Hobart  Original Publication:&nbsp;
 AACS Proceedings of the 6th Annual Convention 
<p>Upon receipt of a letter from Bro. Higgins, requesting me to write a paper 
for this meeting I was at first inclined to refuse, but as he kindly left the 
subject to be chosen to myself, I decided to make an effort, knowing that you 
would excuse any shortcomings, as my experience has been brief, as compared 
with that of a majority of those present.</p> 
<p>When the matter of taking charge of a cemetery was first suggested to me, I 
had been engaged for five years in park work, and was dubious about making the 
change, fearing that the work would not suit me; but the objectionable features 
have all disappeared, and I become daily more and more interested in the work.
</p> 
<p>My first experience was with a close corporation and the cemetery was 
started to supply a &quot;long felt want.&quot;</p> 
<p>The ground selected was an eighty-acre piece of rolling land, of which 
about ten acres were covered with a heavy growth of black oak, ten acres low 
and unavailable, and the balance very handsome meadow land. After having the 
entire piece cross-sectioned, they called upon a well known landscape gardener 
to make a design, which was done, and I proceeded to grade and plat about 
twenty acres, at an expense of about three thousand dollars.&nbsp; A chapel and 
vault were built, costing six thousand dollars.</p> 
<p>About the time we were ready for business the &quot;long felt want&quot; 
had disappeared and no one seemed anxious to die in order to patronize us. I 
remained there about eleven months, during which time we made about one 
hundred-thirty burials. The directors were somewhat disappointed at the small 
amount of business and the correspondingly small income, and had reduced the 
force to a minimum, which compelled me to neglect numerous things which should 
have been attended to.</p> 
<p>Even in this short time I had learned that it was going to be no easy task 
to keep the grounds in good shape, especially where the business was run in 
private interests. The few lot holders we had there, had already proposed some 
of the wildest schemes imaginable for decorating their lots, and our directors 
did not like to oppose them too much. I was about discouraged with the outlook, 
when a proposition was made me to take the position I now occupy.</p> 
<p>Lakewood, at this time, had been established nineteen years, during which 
time the management had been changed but once, the first superintendent having 
held the position twelve and one-half years, and my predecessor six and 
one-half years; the assistant-superintendent four years, while the foreman had 
been in that position from the start. All of these men were removed when I took 
charge.</p> 
<p>As was but natural, they had each a certain following among the lot owners, 
and some of them were much vexed that the change was made, and made it 
correspondingly disagreeable for me for some time.</p> 
<p>Upon coming here I found three hundred bodies in the vault awaiting 
interment, and I can assure you it looked to me like a formidable task, but 
when the time came things seemed to shape themselves about right for me and I 
got well through the spring work without any serious trouble.</p> 
<p>My views as to rules, management of men: etc., differing quite materially 
from those of my predecessor, caused me some trouble with the men who had 
previously worked here, and I had quite a struggle to right things to my ways. 
The rules, existing here previous to my time, were very good, but they had not 
been strictly enforced, and when I attempted to enforce them it brought a great 
many people to the front with their grievances and complaints, and kept me in 
hot water for some time.</p> 
<p>In many respects my experience has been very similar to that of Bro. 
Hamill, as set forth in his paper of last year. I found innumerable rusty wire 
arches, rusty and broken down seats of all descriptions, and every kind of a 
utensil that could be thought of to sprinkle with or carry water in. These had 
to go, and I made a clean sweep of everything that was not fairly presentable. 
Seats and arches are now forbidden, and the consequence is a much neater 
looking cemetery, but much more bitterness of feeling against the 
superintendent, which I hope will die out some day.</p> 
<p>At times I feel somewhat downhearted and despondent at the opposition which 
seems to meet nearly every improvement or change that is suggested, but have 
secured a box of Dr. Barker's &quot;cheerful pills&quot; and find that they 
help me wonderfully.</p> 
<p>There seems to be a wide difference of opinion among lot owners as to what 
constitutes a neat looking and well-kept cemetery lot, but by making an effort 
to meet and talk with them on the subject I can turn a great many of them to my 
way of thinking. A little reflection convinces nearly all of them that at 
general system of improvement is necessary, but all are not so ready to believe 
in its enforcement in their particular case.</p> 
<p>The first impulse of a person purchasing a burial lot seems to be to plant 
something, it makes but little difference what it is, but there must be some 
planting.</p> 
<p>The following from an article written by the late R. M. Copeland, the 
well-known New England landscape gardener, is to the point on this subject: 
&quot;It is natural for everyone who has a cemetery lot to show his interest in 
it by some kind of decoration, and planting trees and shrubs is the simplest 
and most obvious thing to do. But, when we remember that trees, unless when 
grouped to give a compound effect, when each tree loses a part of its beauty or 
effect, to receive something by contrast or harmony with its neighbors, should 
stand from twenty-five to forty feet apart, it is plain that a lot of fifteen 
by twenty does not give much chance for trees; consequently, as everyone wishes 
to plant trees, cemeteries as the lots are sold become too&quot; treesy,&quot; 
too much shade, no intervals of light and grass for contrast; the trees crowd 
each other to their mutual injury; the shade prevents the growth of shrubs, and 
thus we lose the many chances for beauty which they offer. Guided by the 
mistakes that have been made in our older cemeteries, we should try to secure 
for the future a method of treatment which will forbid all changes of grade, 
curbing, fences and over-planting. Even the old cemeteries, as they take in new 
land, can change their vicious practices and approach to the true theory on 
which they were based; but every new one should be sure to foresee the 
capabilities of the grounds selected and adopt such plans for laying them out 
as will insure, in the end, all the naturalness, grace and beauty which result 
from well directed efforts.&quot;</p> 
<p>From the above we can judge of the importance of the subject, and how 
necessary it is to maintain from the start the proper regulations.</p> 
<p>I read with a great deal of interest the articles in the MODERN CEMETERY, 
and heartily agree with most of the writers, but am sorely afraid that it will 
be a long time before the monument dealers will quietly submit to there being 
many of Bro. Eurich's model cemeteries. The desire for display predominates too 
strongly, and the dealers in monumental work can and will encourage large and 
numerous stones more effectually than we can discourage them.<br>

<h2>The Requirements of a Cemetery Superintendent</h2>  Date Published:&nbsp;  
August, 1924  Original Author:&nbsp;  John F. Peterson  Original 
Publication:&nbsp;  AACS Proceedings of the 38th Annual Convention 
<p>If one could cover the best characteristics in human nature in one word, I 
presume that word would be GRACIOUSNESS. Shakespeare said: &quot;The 
King-becoming graces are justice, verity, temperance, stableness, bounty, 
perseverance, mercy, lowliness, devotion, patience, courage and fortitude&quot; 
and if we possess these qualities to some degree we shall possess the 
fundamental requirements for the work in which we are engaged. I want to lay 
stress here on the fact that in this more than in any other line of work a 
Superintendent of a Cemetery must possess to a noticeable degree these best 
elements in human nature.</p> 
<p>Graciousness implies broad sympathy and understanding and who other than a 
Cemetery Superintendent comes mo re often in contact with people when these 
characteristics are needed. Some one has said, &quot;Graciousness is the 
outward manifestation of a fine soul. Like the sun it shed its light every day 
of the year.&quot;</p> 
<p>I am inclined to believe that the title of a paper such as mine tends to 
make one theorize on what should be rather than things and human beings as they 
actually are and for this reason in order to make a practical talk I shall try 
to discuss some actual happenings that reflect the Superintendent in his daily 
work. A real interest in one's work is one of the big factors and the two 
essential fields of human endeavor in which the Superintendent should be 
efficient are engineering and business. Two or three weeks ago I talked with a 
very efficient Superintendent who expressed the opinion that a man in charge of 
a Cemetery should be of a decidedly mechanical turn of mind. My experience of 
seventeen years cemetery work reinforces his opinion.</p> 
<p>The analysis of what constitutes a good Cemetery equipment will I think 
bear this out. For instance in my own case, the property of the Corporation 
contains the following: Office and chapel, a crematory; a side track; a pumping 
station, water-mains and all the necessary hydrants, fountains, etc.; four 
trucks, two automobiles, 8 or 9 steam and hot water boilers, 8 or 10 electric 
motors, 5 to 7 gasoline engines; steam roller and spraying outfits; equipment 
for building roads; equipment for setting all stone work including mausoleums, 
and it naturally follows with this building and plant that a knowledge of 
construction is decidedly necessary to the plant maintenance.</p> 
<p>I feel quite positive that everyone here agrees that knowledge of civil 
engineering in its broadest sense should be a requirement of one in charge of 
cemetery work. The building of roads, changing the contour of land, laying 
water pipe and drains, concrete work in various forms, comprises the every day 
work in modern cemeteries. The civil engineer is the forerunner of 
civilization. He is also the one who hest can lay the foundation for the 
construction of a cemetery as we like to see it today.</p> 
<p>Agriculture and horticulture should form a large part of a Superintendent's 
knowledge, in such a manner that proper landscape work can be executed and the 
ultimate effects of young planting be foreseen years ahead. One of the early 
problems I remember that I had to solve was the elimination of the scale from 
our many, bay trees and half hardy stock. It was an entirely new field of study 
for me at that time but fortunately having had some study in chemistry, it 
helped me accomplish this work. It was done in such a satisfactory manner that 
its results have lasted for fifteen years or more.</p> 
<p>A good business man has always seemed to me to be symbolic of 
self-reliance. The importance of self-reliance needs little more than mere 
mention. If a man is afraid to trust his own conclusions and convictions, all 
his thinking is of no avail and a timid business man is doomed. There are 
fundamental laws governing business and an attempt on our part to acquire 
knowledge relating to these is of decided advantage to the corporation for whom 
we are working. In this as in all fields of human endeavor, thinking is the 
essential thing. The ability to think is not acquired without effort and 
unfortunately many shrink from making the effort. In the words of Joseph 
Johnson, &quot;Thinking is hard work; it is much easier to saw wood.&quot;</p> 
<p>There have been papers read at these meetings in regard to advertising and 
salesmanship. In New England particularly, advertising of cemeteries has no 
place at present but a characteristic desirable in any executive is 
salesmanship. For instance at Mount Auburn there are at present 297 fences; 
there are probably twice that number of curbing. For our part we have got to 
work hard to make these lot owners get our point of view as regards the removal 
of all enclosures and the best salesmanship is that which makes the other man 
get your point of view.</p> 
<p>Tact is a characteristic certainly valuable in our particular line of work. 
Tact is defined as &quot;ready power of appreciating and doing what is required 
by circumstances.&quot; Many unusual circumstances occur in the Cemetery man's 
work where all the tact that he can master is necessary to relieve the 
situation. I often recall the experience of J. W. Lovering who preceded Mr. 
Scorgie. A lady insisted on placing a mausoleum on her lot which measured 20' x 
20'. Her lot measured 15' x 20'. When Mr. Lovering called the facts of the 
situation to her attention, her answer was, &quot;I am alone with my dead, 
there is no one to help me.&quot; It was not very long after this instance that 
Mr. Lovering met with an accident that later caused his death. This was 
interpreted by the lady as an act of God because the Superintendent would not 
allow her to place the mausoleum she desired on her lot. There are in all lines 
of work people who at times apparently lose sight of reason and in the ordinary 
business a sharp shock or answer may straighten out the matter. It is quite 
often that unreasonable demands are made upon us and it is at such times, that 
the Superintendent can be valuable to his organization.</p> 
<p>I have often been asked as undoubtedly many of you have as to why we 
selected this particular line of work. In fact the question was asked me last 
Friday when I was arranging about some planting on a lot. One sentence answers 
for me. I find the work decidedly interesting and there is no end of study that 
one can do to really become proficient in it. I recall the first interview I 
had with Mr. Prentiss Cummings late President of Mount Auburn Cemetery when I 
was candidate for the position of Assistant Superintendent. He said he knew of 
few lines of work which required so much knowledge in the various fields of 
human activity as that of a cemetery superintendent and I feel sure that you 
will go a long way among clubs and associations to find in any association men 
of higher talent or ideal; than such men as James Currie, James C. Scorgie, 
Edgar King, W. S. Pirie, W. F. Landes, Arthur N. Hobart and many more that I 
could mention. It is a worthy and honorable work in which we are engaged and 
decidedly essential to our modern life. Practical work and sentiment enter 
largely into everyday operations and this reminds me of an appropriate summing 
up of the primary use of a cemetery made by a friend and lot owner at Mount 
Auburn. He said &quot;The utilitarian aspect of the interment of human remains 
is concerned only with an excavation in the earth of sufficient size and depth. 
All other considerations are matters of sentiment. Respect for the departed, 
the wish to perpetuate their names in the minds of the living, the desire that 
the final resting place may be attractively embellished with artistic memorials 
and be maintained in orderly neatness, are all matters of sentiment. But what 
would human life be without sentiment? Without question, below that of the 
beasts. If one acquires a fine lot in a well kept cemetery and derives 
satisfaction there from, no excuses need be framed, for his act and feelings 
spring from some of the best elements in human nature. He who honors not the 
dead is likely to neglect his duty to the living.</p> 
<p>The progress of institutions and men is inevitably dependent on ideals and 
desires for something larger, and better. As the principal motive force in the 
improvement of the cemetery, the Superintendent should never be satisfied with 
existing conditions. I always like to have before me the inspiring words of 
Bishop Brooks &quot;Sad is the day for any man when he becomes absolutely 
satisfied with the life he is living, the thoughts that he is thinking and the 
deeds that he is doing, when there ceases to be forever beating at the door of 
his soul a desire to do something larger which he feels and knows he was meant 
and intended to do.&quot;</p>

<h2>Cemetery Problems</h2>  Date Published:&nbsp;  August, 1924  Original 
Author:&nbsp;  Henry S. Adams  Treasurer-Superintendent, Forest Hill Cemetery, 
Jamaica Plain, Massachussetts  Original Publication:&nbsp;  AACS Proceedings of 
the 38th Annual Convention 
<p>When I was asked by your President to write a paper for this meeting, it 
seemed to me that so many subjects have been covered in the past that there is 
comparatively little new to be said, unless one considered the cemeteries from 
a new angle.</p> 
<p>In thinking over Cemetery problems for the last few years the great changes 
which have come about in cemetery methods and ideals have been subjects to 
which I have given a great deal of thought and the paper which I am presenting 
to you to day is along these lines. Sometimes I think I am dreaming and if I am 
I want you to dream along with me and look into the future of Cemetery 
development.</p> 
<p>As we compare the earlier Cemeteries with those of today we find many 
changes have come about. These have been due partly to economic conditions, but 
also very largely to the taste and ideas of the lot owners and while many 
Cemetery men have been leaders in these ideas it is also true that the public 
are demanding even greater changes, and that there are many forces at work 
which I believe will result in more beautiful cemeteries. As Cemetery men we 
cannot shut our eyes to these changes in public sentiment or we will be carried 
off our feet by forces which we cannot control anymore than the winds and the 
tides.</p> 
<p>Economic conditions are making for simpler tastes in Cemetery Memorials and 
our public is demanding, not merely submitting, to regulations in regard to 
memorial stones. This will gradually result in fewer stones and in far better 
stones, each a work of art in a beautiful location.&nbsp; Here is a problem of 
cooperation with designers of memorials which must be worked out carefully.</p> 
<p>When all is said and done I believe their business will improve rather than 
otherwise and they will have less competition and greater opportunity to study 
their work and make finer memorials.</p> 
<p>Cremation means easy burial and should be looked upon as merely a 
preparation of the body for interment. When looked upon that way the sentiment 
remains, only the body is in a different form while neither earth burial or 
ashes are pleasant the public seem to be tending toward cremation which will I 
believe, especially in the East, simplify the Cemetery problem. Trenching will 
not be necessary and the natural landscape can be preserved.</p> 
<p>So much then for a glimpse of some of the things I have been thinking about 
and which I hope you will take home with you for serious consideration.</p> 
<p>What are some of the practical cemetery problems of today and how do they 
compare with those ten or twenty years ago? Working conditions have changed 
materially in the last ten years, probably more so than at any previous period 
in the life of the ordinary cemetery unless possibly during and after the Civil 
War period.</p> 
<p>What of labor costs? Ten years ago for the week ending August 1, there were 
on our payroll 118 men working 54 hours per week. In 1924 there were 96 men 
working 47&frac12; hours per week, or a loss of 1822 working hours. Is this 
because the men work harder and it requires fewer working hours to keep up a 
constantly increasing area? I hardly think so! Our Cemeteries are growing 
larger and we all know men do not work any harder than they used to.</p> 
<p>Now let us look further into the problem. Since August 1, 1914 we have sold 
nearly 1,000 new lots besides hundreds of single graves and there have been 
erected in the cemetery several thousand additional monuments and headstones, 
everyone of which has added to the labor of maintaining our grounds. With the 
great reduction in working hours our payroll is over nine hundred dollars more 
for the week and yet our income for perpetual care on the old lots has not 
increased. We have accomplished more in fewer working hours.</p> 
<p>I have pictured a condition no worse than that in which the average 
cemetery find's itself and what future labor charges will be few would care to 
predict. Now what have we done to balance these increased costs? Do we keep our 
Cemeteries looking as well as ten years ago? And what of the future?</p> 
<p>The average Cemetery probably is as well kept as ever and many improvements 
have been forced upon us which have made work easier and made it possible to 
keep a pace with the new working conditions.</p> 
<p>We have substituted modern equipment in the way of trucks, automobiles and 
motor lawnmowers and the following table shows the effect upon the cost of 
perpetual care of the grass.</p>

<p>The result of these improvements with us has meant that while it averaged 
.0126 per square foot to give a lot perpetual care in 1913, in 1923 with labor 
150% it should have cost .0315 while it actually cost only .0225 or a saving of 
nearly one cent per square foot and I can definitely say that the Cemetery is 
kept as well or better today than ever.</p> 
<p>We have also eliminated many unnecessary Cemetery groups of summer bedding 
plants substituting for them hardy shrubs, trees and grass. We are eliminating 
bothersome terraces or planting them with hardy plants which are easy to care 
for and we have done away with useless grave walks, substituting grass which 
greatly improves the appearance of the grounds. We have improved our roads so 
they require less care and are adapted to automobile traffic and altogether 
made many improvements which have resulted in the double satisfaction to us, 
saving work and beautifying the grounds. What is there left to do to these 
older parts of the grounds? I am afraid not much. Our hope then is that 
conditions shall not become worse, but better.</p> 
<p>What of the future. This opens up many avenues of thought and leads us to 
think of the past, the present and the future. A class of students in Landscape 
Gardening recently visited our Cemetery and was told that it was a fine example 
of a Cemetery, but in a few years would be out-of-date, or words to that 
effect, because the Cemetery of the future would have only ground markers.</p> 
<p>Our old Cemeteries had terraced lots, gravel paths, poor avenues, granite 
curbs, iron fences, monuments and headstones galore until you get the 
incongruous mass stone work seen in some of the old Cemeteries in the large 
cities. Then came the lawn plan, with a reduction in many things, but still too 
much grading, too many monuments and too much show, not enough of quiet, peace 
and harmony.</p> 
<p>Is it going too far to say the Park Plan is appearing in the horizon and 
that such a Cemetery will really 'be the most perfect of all? Not a park in the 
ordinary sense of the word, or a play ground, but a memorial plot of sacred 
ground where all who enter may be quiet, mediate and think of the lost ones. 
The memorials here shall be simple, natural boulders, covered with vines and 
bushes, with plates recording the names of those buried there, grade markers 
wherever desired and beautiful memorials, erected by contributions from lot 
holders and in suitable locations to commemorate the dead in that portion of 
the Cemetery. Such memorials would be carefully designed by the most famous 
artists and sculptors of the day-each one a gem in itself in a beautiful 
setting and erected of the finest suitable material, regardless of cost. What 
an opportunity to design special sections; the whole a harmonious pot with a 
definite theme beautifully carried out.</p> 
<p>Would not such a Cemetery be far more beautiful than the battlefield at 
Gettysburg, which we saw last year, where the monumental work is often too 
thick and ugly even though the area is large and the landscape beautiful. 
Natural landscape will be retained and possibly the day will come when the 
earth burial is as uncommon as the cremation is today and the necessity of 
digging graves in difficult ground will be eliminated.</p> 
<p>Are we dreamers when we talk of such things? I don't think so. I think we 
must get this idea into our heads or a new group of Cemetery men, under the 
direction of the best landscape architects, will come along and build these 
Cemeteries while we are worrying about it. This is the Cemetery beautiful and 
we must study the idea and show our public how such a Cemetery may be made 
possible. How much more satisfactory such a Cemetery will be, nothing 
depressing but only sacred ground, quiet, peaceful and altogether lovely.</p> 
<p>We have all of us studied the difficult problems of laying out Cemeteries 
to make them beautiful with rolling lawns, trees, shrubs and graceful avenues 
only to have them ruined with the laying out of lots and erection of memorial 
work and all our efforts seem to be in vain.</p> 
<p>In the old days Cemetery Superintendents always laid out the Cemetery in 
squares, now we try to do better, but our problem is difficult and the results 
often discouraging. The park Cemetery will solve many of these problems and we 
all know the fewer lots in a section the better it looks. We have discarded 
curbing and fences soon we will discard other useless decorations and gradually 
approach the ideal.</p> 
<p>We must study these problems seriously, intently and practically and 
develop our various cemeteries along the ideal which we have in mind, ever 
remembering that we are but servants of the public and that our duty is to 
crystallize and develop the highest ideals in our Cemeteries.</p>

<h2>Cemetery Landscape</h2>  Date Published:&nbsp;  August, 1924  Original 
Author:&nbsp;  Arthur S. Tupper  Superintendent, Brooklyn Heights Cemetery, 
Cleveland, Ohio  Original Publication:&nbsp;  AACS Proceedings of the 38th 
Annual Convention 
<p>The Landscape Development and improvement of a Cemetery is a continual 
process, requiring constant study, perseverance, and patience, and there is no 
landscape problem that deserves more consideration and study. A cemetery may be 
planned and developed, conforming to the plans of the most capable landscape 
architects and yet, through the ravages of time, the addition of new features 
or the removal of old ones, existing conditions are so changed that constant 
replacements, addition, and re-arrangements are necessary to preserve a 
pleasing and appropriate landscape effect.</p> 
<p>Old trees that have stood out as the prominent features in a given section 
may have to be removed because of damage by storm or defects due to old age. 
Many plantations of trees and shrubs may have included certain rapid growing 
species that were planted for their immediate effect and which it was the 
intention of the architect to remove, as time developed, the slower growing 
species. The erection of additional features, such as monuments, mausoleums, 
and etc., may necessitate additional planting, which would in the absence of 
such features, be misplaced and undesirable; or again, the exact opposite may 
be true of some planting have to be removed or rearranged, on account of the 
creation of new view areas.</p> 
<p>This continual development rearrangement, control and maintenance, should 
all be guided by the same motive, and not show the individual characteristics 
of each succeeding Superintendent or Sexton. To this end it is imperative that 
a general plan of the entire property be made at the outset. The preparing of a 
general plan is also a necessity from the standpoint of economy.</p> 
<p>This plan should be prepared by a competent landscape architect, preferably 
one having made a special study of cemetery landscape and having had experience 
in their development. Unless the architect is to be retained permanently in an 
advisory capacity, which is strongly recommended, the preparing of the general 
plan, is but a part of his work, for the plan should be accompanied by a 
written report of recommendations to cover a period of years, outlining the 
possibilities of the future, the motive behind the plan, the order of its 
development and both general and specific recommendations, relative to the 
treatment and control of individual lots. A report of this kind in the lands of 
a competent manager would insure harmony in future developments and if issued 
in pamphlet form for the benefit of the lot owners, would prove not only of 
educational value but an asset as a sales factor.</p> 
<p>It will be the purpose of this paper to outline a few of the principles of 
landscape development which should be included in such a report.</p> 
<p>The real value of any art may best be measured by the feelings it creates, 
the emotion it stirs, and the inspiration it offers to those seeing or hearing 
its expressions. The success or value of our cemeteries (as works or landscape 
are) may then be measured by the nature of the feelings, the emotions stirred 
and the inspiration given to our visitors and lot owners while in the 
atmosphere of the cemetery. What should be the nature of these feelings and 
emotions or what atmosphere should our cemetery create?</p> 
<p>First: </p> 
<p>The atmosphere of the presence of God, as evidenced by the feelings of 
ease, peace, hope, seclusion and righteous inspiration.</p> 
<p>Second: </p> 
<p>The feeling that an artist has utilized the gifts of nature in adapting 
them for a special use and purpose in creating a beautiful place in which the 
living may lay their dead.</p> 
<p>Third: </p> 
<p>The feelings, emotions and inspirations prompted by the visible evidence of 
individual tributes to the love, memory and honor of departed Loved Ones, ever 
mindful of the fact that Death is the Great Equalizer and is not controlled by 
worldly power or position.</p> 
<p>These are the feelings that the landscape architect should endeavor to 
create in our cemeteries by the method in which he preserves, develops, 
regulates and controls the elements which make up the cemetery landscape. We 
are all familiar with the terms &quot;Lawn Plan&quot; and &quot;Memorial 
Park&quot; as descriptive of what the predominating elements of our modern 
cemeteries are today. These terms have undoubtedly served their purpose in an 
educational way but I sincerely hope that their continued use will not prevail 
or will not be necessary, for through the efforts of this and allied 
associations I look forward to the day when the word &quot;cemetery&quot; will 
need no qualifications to convey to the minds of the people a distinct meaning 
vastly greater than mere lawn areas and park atmosphere.</p> 
<p>As a race, we have and are developing certain national characteristics in 
our literature, music, painting, architecture, etc. This is especially true in 
our landscape design. Distinctly American landscape design fathered by Andrew 
Jackson Downing and carried to a high degree of individuality by that noted New 
England gardner, Fredrich Law Olmsted, has always been characterized by what is 
known as the naturalistic style of development. Adolph Strauch known as the 
father of the Lawn Plan Cemetery was the first to successfully apply this 
natural style to cemetery development. His application of this natural style, 
although considered at the time an innovation, constituted perhaps the most 
forward step that has been made in the history of cemetery development.</p> 
<p>Although there may be some disagreement as to the degree to which the 
natural style should control the cemetery to the exclusion of all formal 
effects, there can be no disagreement about the fact that the development of 
natural beauty should be the predominant theme in our cemeteries if they are to 
kindle those feelings of emotion and inspiration which we intend that they 
should.</p> 
<p>For the convenience of discussion, let us consider the following units or 
elements which make up the cemetery landscape and their relation to the 
development of an appropriate atmosphere.</p> 
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Entrance area or approach avenue <br>
 
2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Administrative area<br>
 3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Service area 
<br> 4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Driveways <br>
 5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Views and 
special areas<br>
 6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Enclosure <br>
 7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Trees and shrubs<br>
 8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Expressions of sentiment </p> 
<p>First: Entrance Area or Approach Avenue </p> 
<p>First impressions are the most lasting consequently the impression created 
by the approach to the cemetery is of vital importance. We cannot turn sharply 
from a busy street finding ourselves immediately in the heart of a cemetery and 
feel that we are in a secluded, quiet and peaceful area, at least, not without 
some shock and subsequent loss of ease. The change being sudden does not permit 
a restful easy transition from the worldly business atmosphere to the quietude 
of the cemetery. The principal function of an entrance area or approach avenue 
should be then to create the feeling of approach to a secluded area of peace 
and quietness. This may be accomplished in four ways: First, it may be possible 
to approach the cemetery by way of a city or town boulevard system, tree lined 
and restricted to pleasure vehicles; second, the use of a natural approach as a 
ravine, or gully within the grounds itself. Ferncliff Cemetery, of Springfield, 
Ohio, has an example of such an approach following between a stream and a bluff 
on and not particularly adopted for burial purposes; third, the purchase and 
development of a special right of way to the cemetery as has been done with 
such a pleasing effect at Forest Hill Cemetery, in Boston, MA; fourth, by the 
actual construction of a short drive within the cemetery grounds itself. This 
drive should ordinarily be of a winding nature in order to make it appear 
longer and offer a better opportunity to effectively screen a sudden complete 
view of the cemetery itself. This entrance or approach area should be treated 
as such in its landscape development, that is, there should be as far as 
possible, no spectacular or distracting views on either side, the main view 
being directly ahead. Consequently, an appropriate treatment would be a tree 
lined avenue with heavy plantings of shrubbery along the sides.</p> 
<p>Second: Administrative Area. </p> 
<p>The office building and fits accessories should, for the convenience of the 
public and the management, be located at or near the entrance. If the approach 
has been effectively made, the office building and entrance features may be 
combined and should be of harmonizing architectural design. If, however, the 
approach has been quite sudden it is advisable to have the office building 
somewhat separated from the gate or entrance feature so as to create the 
impression that it is well within the atmosphere of the cemetery, thus perhaps 
softening the mental feelings of those transacting business therein.<br>
 &nbsp;
<br> Simplicity in design and landscape effects should predominate in this area 
as it is purely an area created as a necessity and not of special meaning in 
the landscape itself. Massive and elaborate gateways are not desirable as they 
produce a harsh feeling of rigid enclosure and lack of freedom. Memorial 
arches, a pair or group of pillars with suggestive chains, an arbor, or some of 
the iron gateways of simple design which create the feeling of protection 
without the harshness of an actual barrier are the best types of entrance 
features. The architect in designing the entrance features and office building 
should work in harmony with the landscape designer, especially with regard to 
the question of views from the office or waiting room.</p> 
<p>Views from that part of the office where the public transact their business 
should not include scenes of burial areas, but should be limited either to 
distant views or that landscape area immediately surrounding the office as it 
is undesirable to create the impression of burial in close proximity to the 
administrative area. Open lawn areas framed with groups and specimens of shade 
trees and shrubs should constitute the principal landscape elements of this 
area.</p> 
<p>Third: Service Area. </p> 
<p>The service area and its buildings should be located and designed purely 
from the economic standpoint to service and utilization of space least adapted 
for burial purposes. Although this area should receive consideration in the 
actual plan of the cemetery it requires no special mention in a written report.
</p> 
<p>Fourth: Driveways. </p> 
<p>The driveways of the cemetery although developed principally for the 
purpose of service in providing access to the burial areas, constitute 
nevertheless one of the most important elements of the landscape and may be 
made one of the most attractive features, if properly designed and constructed. 
The general scheme of road design has been discussed in many papers given at 
these conventions and we are all thoroughly familiar with the preferred methods 
of following the general contour of the ground utilizing the valleys for 
roadways, eliminating sharp turns, circles and the so-called geometrical 
projections of the engineer, the proper distance between the driveways, their 
drainage, relative grade with the surrounding area, elimination of the reverse, 
curve, etc., etc. These and many other factors, the landscape architect must 
consider in his arrangement of the general plan.</p> 
<p>I will touch on a few of the principles of landscape which might be 
emphasized in a written report, supplementary to the actual plan or design.</p> 
<p>You will recall that we treated our entrance drives, purely as an approach 
to the cemetery, and therefore limited the view solely to the area of the 
approach and entrance. We have a somewhat different condition now we have 
arrived in the cemetery for the driveways being primarily means of access to 
burial areas, must permit in fact emphasize this feeling of access through 
actual visibility or views of the burial areas. We will discuss the nature of 
these views a little later.<br>
 &nbsp;<br>
 Sentimentally one road is as 
important as another, yet there are two influences which must be considered in 
determining their relative importance from the standpoint of design. First 
there is the purely mathematical or engineering factor which determines the 
width of roadways according to the area which they serve and the probable 
traffic from the standpoint of service. Second, there is the question of which 
roads should be made the most attractive on account of their location, the area 
to which they lead, and the views which they afford.</p> 
<p>From the standpoint of landscape development those roads which offer the 
most pleasing general views should be made the most important and prominent. 
Many of our owners prefer a lot that is in a prominent location, while others 
prefer secluded spots. Our roadways should reflect with their prominence, the 
areas to which they lead. Thus a roadway leading to an area developed 
particularly for its reclusive atmosphere should not entice the visitor by its 
prominence or natural ease of approach.</p> 
<p>Roadways while designed to create a natural easy approach to the burial 
area, must also create a natural free and easy movement of traffic leading out 
of the grounds. This is quite important especially in our large cemeteries, 
which if poorly designed, very often remind one of a maze which is very easily 
entered but one has an awful time trying to find the way out.</p> 
<p>There has been a tendency of recent years to plant a row of trees on either 
side of the road, thus creating a tree lined avenue or boulevard of every 
thoroughfare in the cemetery. There are undoubtedly many roads that and 
improved with this treatment, but were every road thus lined with trees 
restricting our views to the limit of the roadway, we would leave the cemetery 
with thoughts only or beautiful drives. Let us create a greater feeling of 
variety and naturalness in our cemeteries by framing some of our views with 
groups of trees and shrubs rather than evenly spaced row of trees bordering our 
roadways.</p> 
<p>There has also been a tendency to construct the roadways of light colored, 
glaring materials, thus magnifying their prominence. This may be desirable in 
some instances of formal treatment as around the Chapel, but for the most part 
I think the roadways, should be as inconspicuous as possible, considering their 
natural prominence from the standpoint of service. Therefore, the roadways 
should be constructed with materials of subdued color. Tarvia bound macadam 
with a sweep coat of trap rock screenings being perhaps the best in this 
locality.</p> 
<p>Five: Views and Special Areas. </p> 
<p>Views and vistas constitute the principal landscape effect of the cemetery. 
In general landscape development the large sweeping lawn areas provide our most 
pleasing views. Unfortunately in our cemeteries, we are greatly limited in the 
possibilities of creating these views on a large scale because of the 
predominance of expressions of individual sentiment by means of monuments, head 
stones, urns and flower beds.</p> 
<p>The nature of the development around the administration area, the 
reservation of special areas, and restrictions governing the erection of 
monuments, will allow the architect to create some of these larger lawn areas, 
but for the most part, our views will consist or limited view areas. This is by 
no means an objectionable feature however, as the smaller the view areas are, 
the greater their number and variety will be, thus magnifying the extent of the 
grounds, and its atmosphere of privacy and seclusion.</p> 
<p>Nearly every cemetery has one or two particularly beautiful spots, such as 
ponds, wooded slopes, or artistic buildings, which as natural features or 
artistic developments constitute the main views about which our roadways are 
developed. These views must be properly framed in the landscape picture and 
their beauty gradually unfolded to us as we proceed along the drives. I say 
gradually unfolded, because the sudden vision of an unexpected scene creates 
not only a feeling of admiration but also the feeling of surprise with a 
resultant unconscious suspense and alertness of mind, which is at variance with 
the feelings of ease and peace that we wish to create. Consequently our views 
should be presented not by the sudden unfolding of one spectacular view or 
several minor ones all at once but through a gradual transition from one to 
another catching a glimpse now and then of some view beyond that promises added 
attraction as we approach it, but which glimpse is not sufficiently prominent 
to detract from the complete view then in line of view.</p> 
<p>One beautiful spot may be viewed from many angles, each view being as 
attractive as the other and yet sufficiently different to preclude the feeling 
of sameness or predominance of any particular feature to the exclusion of the 
lesser views and features; as our nation has developed certain characteristics 
of landscape so each cemetery and each section in the cemetery should have its 
outstanding features and characteristics. This character of the cemetery as a 
whole should be expressed in the development of the natural beauties 
characteristic of the grounds which we see unfolded in series of beautiful 
views and vistas.<br>
 &nbsp;<br>
 An individual character may be given to 
various sections, not only by the way we develop the natural features but also 
by the way in which we control and regulate the individual expression of the 
lot owners in a given section. Thus we may develop sections of either a 
prominent or a reclusive nature, garden theme sections, sections developed 
particularly for the burial of soldiers or special lodges, avenues or areas 
developed to private mausoleums, etc., etc., even giving a pleasing 
individuality and naturalness to the single grave section. The landscape 
architect should be informed of the probable need of such sections in the 
cemetery to be developed and in his report include special recommendations for 
their control and development.</p> 
<p>Six: Enclosure. </p> 
<p>Whenever possible the enclosure of a cemetery should consist of a natural 
planting of trees and shrubs and not an artificial barrier of rigid enclosure. 
Unfortunately the later form of enclosure is in most cases a necessity but can 
be supplemented with a suitable planting to relieve its harshness. Boundary 
planting should be made with particular attention given to its sky line. A 
stiff formal hedge-like planting of either trees or shrubs of the same height 
is not desirable. Boundary planting controls the views of scenes without the 
grounds and forms a background for those within. Views without the grounds 
should he limited to those distant views which impress one with the magnitude 
of the universe. Views within the grounds should have a background with a 
varied skyline to convey the feeling of depth and distance.</p> 
<p>Seven: Trees and Shrubs. </p> 
<p>Trees and shrubs are the material which the landscape artist uses to frame 
existing and create new views. The placing of this material is purely a matter 
of study in each individual case to create and frame the most pleasing views, 
and screen the undesirable with a natural arrangement. I hope to have given you 
some inspiration that will assist you in your study of the proper arrangement 
of the trees and shrubs in your cemetery as a means of controlling the views. 
For assistance in the arrangement of this material for natural effects, I can 
recommend no better help than a study of nature's own arrangement. In nature, 
we find our trees and shrubs growing either singly or in groups or in 
compositions of single specimens and groups combined. When in groups we may 
find one separate group of a single species or again a group may contain two or 
more species, one species prevailing in a certain area and gradually being 
replaced by another species.&nbsp; When singly we may find a few single 
specimens scattered within a group of another species or we will find a few 
specimens growing singly without attachment to any particular group.&nbsp; When 
in combination of single specimens and groups, we usually find a clump of four 
or five and then not far distant a single specimen or two which although 
separated from the group, are seemingly attached to it.</p> 
<p>When trees and shrubs are found growing together the shrubs are usually 
grouped in the foreground as a sort of border in front of the trees, which 
arrangement would he characteristic of our border or enclosure planting.</p> 
<p>When trees and shrubs are growing more or less detached then the tree is 
usually in the foreground flanked with one or more groups of shrubs. This 
arrangement is ideal for use in the burial area with the shrubs serving as 
background for the monuments and the trees breaking up the views into separate 
pictures and adding depth to the composition.</p> 
<p>Skyline plays an important part in this, nature's arrangement and many 
really wonderful illusions can be accomplished in our landscape effects by a 
careful attention to skyline. We can create the appearance of distance or vice 
versa. We can make undulating ground appear to be level ground or we can level 
off the steep slope almost at will simply through an interchange of high or low 
growing species in the foreground or background depending on the effect to be 
produced.</p> 
<p>The question of what to plant: Most of those who are entrusted with the 
care of a cemetery are more or less familiar with the more common trees and 
shrubs and their natural habit of growth and these should constitute the 
majority of our plantings. For reference purposes, and a handy guide in 
selecting plants for special purposes, I would recommend the text books 
published by Doubleday Page &amp; Company called &quot;The Complete 
Garden&quot; by A. D. Taylor, Landscape Architect. As a general rule plants 
used for backgrounds to monuments should have a dense even foliage and be 
planted close together or in clumps, while plants used in groups purely for the 
purpose of separating one area from another should have a less dense foliage 
and be planted more openly thus increasing the lights and shadows and giving an 
appearance of extent and depth to the area. Hard wood trees and hardy shrubs 
should be used almost exclusively, care being taken to provide a continuity of 
bloom and color.</p> 
<p>Eight: Expression of Sentiment. </p> 
<p>I cannot agree with some of the landscape architects who would prohibit 
expression of individual sentiment to the point of excluding all memorials and 
personal tributes. We cannot afford to make parks and only parks of our 
cemeteries. Why do we say we develop the cemetery for the living as well as for 
the dead? Is it merely to present them with a beautiful park or is it to create 
a beautiful setting in which the living may lay their dead, and show evidence 
of their love for the departed by the placing of a fitting tribute or memorial 
at this last resting place. Let us not prohibit these personal expressions of 
sentiment, but let us so regulate and restrict them that they do not 
predominate the whole, but become a part of it, thus preserving that feeling of 
harmony, unity and equality which is such a necessity to the atmosphere of the 
cemetery.</p> 
<p>There are many ways in which the individual may express this personal 
tribute. Possibly one of the most appropriate, is the planting of trees, shrubs 
and flowers as memorial, for after all are they not nearest to nature and after 
having served their purpose and the time comes for their removal, they leave no 
scar to mar the landscape.</p> 
<p>Let us encourage their use as expressions of tribute and so regulate their 
use that they may become at least in part a unit in the landscape development. 
Trees and shrubs existing on a lot when sold or originally planned to be placed 
on the lot would settle the problem in many cases. In others the privilege of 
addling a few perennial flowers in the shrubbery group would suffice. Again a 
specimen tree not called for on the original plan but permissible and necessary 
because of developments within the area would be suitable. Certain lots 
specified in the general plan might have the privilege of containing an urn 
filled with vines and flowers. Specific sections or parts of sections might 
contain limited space for the growing of flowers in beds, either to be planted 
by the lot owner or the cemetery. Excessive planting of gaudy flower beds as a 
general privilege however should be prohibited as they constitute only a 
selfish motive.</p> 
<p>One lot owner vainly attempting to outdo the other in mere display, whereas 
in reality the little violet plant placed on the grave maybe a more worthy 
expression of sentiment than the most elaborate display of carpet bedding.</p> 
<p>The most common expression of a lot owner's tribute is the headstone or 
marker. These should be restricted to a height not to exceed four inches about 
the ground level. Markers of this height do not appear as miniature monuments 
on the horizon when seen from the roadway and yet as we approach each stone it 
seems to rise up and show distinctly that it marks a grave as it should.<br>
 
&nbsp;<br>
 The family monument is perhaps the most difficult to control of all 
the memorials. Primarily these should be restricted to certain locations or 
lots specified on the general plan. This location should be for the most part 
well back from the road where the monument will have a background of trees and 
shrubs to give it a proper setting. The majority of the modern cemeteries have 
or are making such provisions in their most recent development but the 
difficulty of regulating or controlling the design and appropriateness of the 
memorial is still a delicate one and one which in many respects controls the 
entire atmosphere of the cemetery. With of course, many exceptions the 
prevailing idea of the public seems to be that a monument is principally a 
means of perpetuating a name in stone. This is the wrong conception of the true 
purpose of a real memorial, which should be a work of art on which the name has 
really little more significance than the name of an artist, penned 
inconspicuously on the canvas of a great painting. If we would restrict the 
size of the name on markers, I feel sure that the public would soon develop an 
appreciation for the real merits of the monument, namely, its artistic 
qualities purely as a work of art, a memorial not a name card.</p> 
<p>In closing, I am suggesting three methods whereby we as Cemetery 
Superintendents and officials may best cooperate to improve and develop the 
character of our cemetery (1) Organization; (2) Cooperation; and (3) Education.
</p> 
<p>1. Organization of local clubs or associations with the objects of 
interesting the different civic authorities, park boards, and county officials, 
with the importance of cemeteries in relation to the boulevard system and park 
systems of the district, and the encouragement of street tree planting on the 
roads leading to the cemetery.</p> 
<p>2. Cooperation with the American Society of Landscape Architects by the 
appointing of a committee to wait on a similar committee from that association 
with the purpose in view of arranging for yearly interchange of speakers at our 
various conventions, whereby we may learn more of the landscape possibilities 
in our cemeteries, and they may be more fully informed of specific problems of 
cemetery landscape.</p> 
<p>3. Education by means of issuing pamphlets for distribution to the public; 
the encouragement of special courses of cemetery management, in the landscape 
departments of our colleges and a similar encouragement of memorial design in 
architectural institutions.</p>

<h2>The Relation of Planting to Memorials and the Trend in Memorial Art</h2>  
Date Published:&nbsp;  August, 1923  Original Author:&nbsp;  Ernest S. Leland  
Original Publication:&nbsp;  AACS Proceedings of the 37th Annual Convention 
<p>When the officials of your society asked me to address this convention; I 
was reluctant to accept the honor because I keenly realize how little qualified 
I am to contribute any information of consequence to such a gathering of 
experts. And I was more sensible to the contrast that has in the past existed 
between the idealism that actuates you in your profession, and the 
commercialism that has wrought such havoc in the art I follow-a contrast that 
led me to feel I might be a stranger within the gates!</p> 
<p>While many of you realize that my personal views and opinions coincide with 
the most advanced and progressive ideals and objectives of your association, 
nevertheless I cannot escape the fact that among my several vocations, I am a 
&quot;stone-man&quot; and that you cannot but invest that term with some bitter 
reflections. I very much hope, however, that you, will not feel as Emerson did, 
when he said to some unfortunate victim of his displeasure, '''What you are 
thunders so loud in my ears that I cannot hear what you say!&quot;</p> 
<p>I can perhaps best express my frame of mind in approaching my subject by 
reciting a little incident I witnessed in Washington a short time ago I went 
for the first time to the United States Supreme Court. And I heard there a 
young lawyer who had come out of the West with the absurd notion in his mind 
that he would show the court how much of the law he knew. In the sublime 
confidence of his conceit, he plunged into an abstract and involved 
dissertation on the law. About the time he reached his climax, the late Mr. 
Justice White leaned over, and rapping his gavel impatiently exclaimed: 
&quot;Counsel will confine his remarks to a statement of the FACTS, the Court 
knows the LAW!&rdquo;&nbsp; And so I want to assure you, my friends, that I 
have not come here with the absurd notion that I can teach this court the law! 
(There are some people you know who think you know enough about the law 
anyhow!) Indeed I feel that I have been asked to bring the proverbial coals to 
New Castle and it isn't going to take you long to find out that I am not a 
lecturer even if I confine my remarks to a statement of the fact.</p> 
<p>It may be true that I have written thousands of columns in magazines, 
newspapers and in some books on art in general and the art of the cemetery and 
the monument in particular; but that is no evidence that I am an authority, 
because like a great many writers I have lived in safety behind a barrage of 
words while the editors were out on the firing line catching all the bullets. 
Lecturing is quite another proposition. You've got to come out in the open and 
go over the top with real ideas, not mere language. And so I feel that Mr. 
Dooley was a great philosopher when he said, &quot;It's not so bad, Hinnisi, to 
have people size ye' up wrong, it's whin they git yer noomber that yer in 
dainger, me bye!&quot; (Laughter)</p> 
<p>Now, I have been asked to talk about &quot;Individual Lot Planting as 
Related to Memorials and the Trend in Cemetery Art.&quot; I am sure you do not 
expect me to essay an abstract or technical discussion of planting and 
horticulture, to dwell upon the elements of effect and their application 
because the technique of planting is part of your profession. I will approach 
that phase of the subject purely as a layman, an artist layman perhaps. And so 
far as the art of the monument is concerned, let me assure you that I am not 
going to inflict upon you one of those cut and dried histories of Memorial Art 
that start with Cleopatra and wind up somewhere around Theda Bara! (Laughter)
</p> 
<p>No, I want to reach out and beyond that sort of thing, if I can. I want to 
talk to you a little while about the mission of beauty in our cemeteries. I 
want to start with the fundamental idea that the cemetery is a vital civic 
institution with a vital mission of the LIVING, not alone the dead! That the 
cemetery is not a mere utility, that beauty is not the mere adornment of a 
utility; and that the monument is something infinitely more than a mere vehicle 
of commerce!</p> 
<p>I want to put over one dominant thought, that it is our mission and the 
mission of beauty in our cemeteries to so fuse and direct art sentiment and 
reverence that our cemeteries will not only reflect, but that they will play a 
part in shaping the moral and spiritual aspirations of the community! I want to 
do this because I believe that it is through beauty and beauty alone, whether 
it be in art or religion that man will ever penetrate the veil of that eternal 
mystery &quot;where God in Man is one with Man in God!&quot;</p> 
<p>And so my theme is the quest of beauty; my text is more art and less stone; 
and my topics will be the function of planting the function of regulations 
governing stone-work and the function of architectural design in the 
achievement of our objective. My arguments will be built on the one premise 
that the great and only obstacle to the quest of beauty in our cemeteries is 
the congestion of stone-work and that the congestion of stone-work is not only 
a detriment to the cemetery beautiful but that it is a menace to the art of the 
monument as well. In my helpless way, I will try to draw my arguments from the 
slides.</p> 
<p>(At this point the lights were extinguished and Mr. Leland's discussion of 
the slides could not be recorded by the convention stenographer. The lecturer 
spoke extemporaneously throughout his address and no notes being available, a 
digest of the topics covered is here given.)</p> 
<p><strong>DIGEST OF SLIDE DISCUSSION</strong></p> 
<p>The sixty or more views were grouped into three divisions,-General Planting 
for the Cemetery, Individual Lot Planting, and slides illustrating Current 
Tendencies in the Art of the Monument.</p> 
<p>In the first group Mr. Leland showed several views illustrating vistas in 
the Harrisburg Cemetery. Describing the roadway of wildwood that leads to one 
entrance of the cemetery he made an appeal for more natural beauty and less 
man-made art, for &quot;more God and less Man in our cemeteries&rdquo;.&nbsp; 
By way of contrast, he followed this appeal with a slide showing an old section 
of the Harrisburg Cemetery immediately beyond the wild-wooded road. 
Complimenting Mr. Barnes for his remarkable achievements in relieving the 
congestion of stonework in this older part of the grounds, Mr. Leland said that 
the natural beauty of the Harrisburg cemetery had gained for the 
superintendent. Mr. Barnes, a well earned reputation as a naturalist and nature 
lover and that the congestion of stone which he inherited from a previous 
generation had given him also somewhat of a reputation as an 
&quot;anti-stoneman&quot; contrasting the old sections of the grounds with the 
new lawn-plan areas.<br>
 &nbsp;</p> 
<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p> Mr. Leland touched upon the elements of effect in cemetery landscapes, 
attributing the major principles to the constructive work of the Association of 
American Cemetery Superintendents. Contrasting the European and American 
cemeteries, with a series of slides, he extolled the achievements of the 
American lawn plan, closing this phase of his discussion with a slide which 
paid tribute to the memory of Adolph Strauch, the centennial of whose birth had 
just passed:</p> 
<p>In Memoriam<br>
 Adolph Strauch<br>
 August 30, 1822<br>
 April 25, 1883</p>
<p>Father of the American Lawn Plan Cemetery; his vision, ideals and 
achievements have exercised an international influence and his life will ever 
be a source of inspiration to all men in his field who sense the larger mission 
of their calling.</p> 
<p>The second group of slides, on Individual Lot Planting, opened with a 
series of views selected to illustrate the point that the lawn-plan alone was 
not sufficient to insure a beautiful cemetery and to relieve inevitable 
stone-work, that the lawn-plan was a means and not an end The views contrasted 
lawn-plan sections in which the monuments were relieved and un-relieved by 
individual lot plantings. Mr. Leland supplemented his argument with a slide 
quoting the late James Currie as follows:</p> 
<p>&ldquo;. . . .Deciduous and evergreen shrubs; dwarf conifers liberally and 
judiciously interspersed, and artistically arranged are invaluable accessories 
in disguising or softening the bald and often harsh effect of obtrusive stone 
structures, and enhancing the beauty and harmony of some beautiful and 
artistically designed monument.&quot;<br>
 The late James Currie <br>
 Courtesy 
of &quot;Park &amp; Cemetery&quot;</p> 
<p>Followed then a series of slides illustrating the efficacy of individual 
lot planting in relieving congestion of stone-work and in beautifying 
plots.&nbsp; The subjects ranged from simple headstones to imposing 
mausoleums.&nbsp; The symbolism of planting and examples of good composition in 
harmonizing the planting with the memorial were shown. Before and after effects 
were illustrated by numerous slides. Mr. Leland appealed for the adequate 
endowment of planting on individual lots maintaining that foresighted designers 
of memorials today were advising their clients to include proper planting and 
endowment in the total appropriation for a memorial.&nbsp; With the beautiful 
Olmstead plot in Harrisburg Cemetery as an example, he showed how the 
resourceful designer and architect can cooperate with the cemetery authorities 
in reclaiming and utilizing steep embankments for burial plots of singular 
beauty, a far more intelligent expenditure of money and labor than applies to 
the average mausoleum, he said. Mr. Leland advocated a movement to demand much 
larger plots surrounding mausoleums, maintaining that it was poor taste and 
poor judgment for lot owners to expend large sums for stone and little or 
nothing for plots, and that the results were no less harmful to the cemetery 
than they are to the builders of mausoleums.&nbsp; He illustrated the unhappy 
effects resulting from the &quot;tenement row&quot; placing of such structures, 
arguing for more isolation and the placing of such buildings against natural 
screens such as bills and mass plantings.&nbsp; Among the many other topics 
included in this group of slides Mr. Leland considered several methods by which 
the designer of memorials can save a beautiful vista in the cemetery.</p> 
<p>Coming to the third and last group, the lecturer showed slides illustrating 
the consequences of laxity in the regulation of stone-work and their effect 
upon both the cemetery and the art of the monument. He showed a slide quoting 
the following opinion from the writings of the late James Scorgie.<br>
 &nbsp;
<br> &quot;Forty years ago, it looked like an endless conflict between the 
forces of selfishness, ignorance and prejudice, and those of culture and 
regulation. I can see not only a vast improvement, but a public opinion behind 
that improvement that insures for permanence.&quot;<br>
 -The late James C. 
Scorgie<br>
 Courtesy of &quot;Cemetery Handbook&quot; </p> 
<p>With logical arguments he appealed for more and better regulations 
governing stone-work,-not less, and he illustrated the desirability of such 
rules from the designer's point of view. Briefly touching upon the 
controversial &quot;grass-marker&quot; Mr. Leland maintained that the objective 
of the grade marker was beyond all criticism and that the only objection was 
one of personal taste. He expressed preference for the marker p1aced not more 
than four inches above grade, explaining that his criticism of the grade-marker 
was that it lacked definition around the edges in consequence of overgrowing 
grass. He illustrated his argument with slides but qualified his opinion by 
observing that the subordination of the marker was so vital that either method 
had much in its favor. By means of numerous slides he showed the efficacy of 
certain rules and regulations restricting stone-work notably in the area of 
monuments, the use of ledgers and kindred subjects. He explained a new rule 
that Woodlawn Cemetery in New York has recently adopted, one that regulated the 
superficial area of a monument. This rule is to be considered in a special 
article in PARK &amp; CEMETERY. Mr. Leland also showed various methods employed 
by designer in attaining individuality of design through adaptation. He closed 
his forty minutes of discussion with a review of current tendencies in design, 
placing emphasis upon the so-called formal garden themes.&nbsp; (Lights turned 
on)</p> 
<p>I am afraid that I have rather superficially covered the subject. In 
conclusion I would like to suggest just one more thought. People often say to 
me. &quot;Leland, I don&rsquo;t see how you can like your business, this 
business of designing tombstones all the time!&quot; And I daresay in your work 
you frequently hear similar facetious remarks of this kind. Now I am frank to 
tell you I do not like the &quot;monument business&quot;, the 
&quot;business&quot; of selling monuments. I do not love a work that brings me 
in constant association with sorrow and suffering. No, I do not like the 
&quot;monument business!&quot;&nbsp; But thank God in common with a great many 
of my contemporaries, I can and I do love the ART that makes it possible for me 
to transform a rough hewn block of stone into a thing of significance, soul and 
beauty! I do love the Art of the Monument!</p> 
<p>And you men and you women - you cannot love the funeral aspects of your 
profession,-however little contact many of you may have with this phase of your 
work, - you cannot love this association with grief, sorrow and suffering. But 
you can and you do love the larger mission of your cal1ing!&nbsp; -The service 
that makes it possible for you to create beauty and tranquility out of chaos 
and despair!&nbsp; -You can and you do love the work, the service that through 
the inspiration of your great association makes it possible, in the words of 
Mr. Currie, not only to reflect but to shape the moral and spiritual 
aspirations of the community. You CAN LOVE this, the larger mission of your 
calling!</p>

<h2>Some Duties of A Cemetery Superintendent</h2>  Date Published:&nbsp;  
August, 1923  Original Author:&nbsp;  Leonard Ross  Original Publication:&nbsp; 
 AACS Proceedings of the 37th Annual Convention 
<p>This is a paper on Cemetery management prepared and read by me at a meeting 
of the New England Cemetery Association in Boston, Mass., in 1912 which I have 
been asked to revise and present to this convention and which in an unguarded 
moment I consented to do, gratified and pleased, of course, that my thoughts 
then expressed were considered worthy of repetition. But when I looked it over 
with a view to making any desirable changes applicable to a National gathering 
of men engaged in the same work which occupied most of my time and thought for 
many years, and in the light of eleven years of further experience and 
observation I find little that I care to revise; rather would I speak more 
emphatically concerning the somewhat radical methods then advocated and 
executed by me in the matter of restoration and after care of neglected lot 
areas. I would ask you however to bear in mind that the conditions and methods 
indicated are based upon New England conditions and may not prove adaptable in 
our more southern latitudes, realizing as I do that each and every part of our 
great country has its own problems which can only be solved by a knowledge and 
study of local conditions.</p> 
<p>The Century Dictionary says that a Cemetery is &quot;A place set apart for 
interments; a graveyard; specifically, a burial ground not attached to any 
church; a necropolis.&quot; Without doubt a satisfactory definition to the 
average mind, but who of us, engaged in the active and practical care and 
administration of Cemeteries will say that the real effort required of us in 
the discharge of our duties consists in any considerable degree in directing 
the actual excavation of the ground and the placing therein of the remains of a 
deceased person; or even the physical preparation, care and adornment of areas 
in question, necessary and important though this be. Not one of us, I venture 
to say.</p> 
<p>But rather will you, I think, agree with me that our deepest thought and 
greatest anxieties are given to the financial and managerial questions. While 
the family affairs, characteristics and conditions of mind of our lot owners 
require a degree of skill, thought, energy and diplomacy, which exhausts our 
bodies and minds, whitens our hair and furrows our brow.</p> 
<p>Some one has irreverently said that we have much to do with skeletons; Yes 
indeed we have, the skeleton of the family, many first brought to the light of 
day while endeavoring to determine who owns or who shall &quot;boss&quot; the 
Cemetery Lot; who shall, or who shall not, be buried therein, or removed there 
from, after the death of the original owner.</p> 
<p>We must also sometimes explain why it is that each and every lot cannot 
have the grass cut and all other necessary care work done on the day before the 
family happens to visit the cemetery, accompanied by relatives from a distance 
who have been led to suppose that their particular lot was always in perfect 
condition, even though they had neglected to give the order for its care, and 
of course, you must not say this in the presence of &quot;Auntie&quot; (who, by 
the way, is advancing in years and has most of the available cash in the 
family.) Why, in midsummer, the grass is not green, although we have not been 
favored with a particle of atmospheric moisture for many weeks. Why the grass 
does not show a luxurious growth under the trees. Why you permitted the 
erection on an adjoining lot of such a monumental monstrosity and you listen to 
an outpouring of words in ecstatic praise of their own &quot;Rock Face&quot; 
creation.</p> 
<p>You are finally enlightened by the information that &quot;out West where I 
live they do things better,&quot; and through it all you are supposed to give 
your whole attention to the cultivation of a smile upon your face which can be 
classed as &quot;Cherubic&quot; and &quot;Apologetic,&quot; otherwise you are 
informed that &quot;I shall certainly write to the Mayor&quot; or to the 
Chairman of your Board of Trustees, as the case may be, or it may be that they 
will decide that it is best to call attention to the alleged condition of 
affairs through the medium of the newspapers.</p> 
<p>At this point your foreman gives you the delightful information that one of 
the pair of new horses you purchased, and in which you feel such pride, 
&quot;will not pull the hat off your head,&quot; and that the driver is 
&ldquo;no good anyhow&rdquo;.&nbsp; Never mind; you must lie calm, so over to 
the new work mount the seat, take the reins, talk to the horses and enjoy the 
sensation which comes of seeing them pull out the load in good shape, only to 
be met a few minutes later by your Supervisor of Interments who informs you 
that some undertaker has forgotten to bring the burial permit (which he has 
probably not yet asked the Board of Health to issue) but promises to send it 
out in the morning, &quot;Shall I let him by?&quot; he asks. After an 
investigation of the facts you wearily answer, &quot;Yes, but don't do it 
again.&quot;</p> 
<p>The bell in the tower signals that you are wanted at the office. On 
reaching it you find a bereaved widower who wishes to purchase a two-grave lot, 
no more, &quot;just a place to lay her, and another for me when I am 
called.&quot; You complete the sale, and if he is a young man you withdraw from 
sale the adjoining lot, well knowing that within a year or so he will, while on 
a visit to the cemetery, express his regret that he did not get a larger lot. 
You suddenly discover that the adjoining one is still unsold. He is greatly 
pleased and buys it, soon after he will be accompanied on his periodical 
visits, which become less and less frequent, by another lady. Again the 
cherubic smile appears upon your face and you are so glad that the adjoining 
lot remained unsold for nearly two years.</p> 
<p>You are pleased with yourself and fall to studying out some new improvement 
and estimating its cost, your door opens and you are confronted by a large, 
red-necked &quot;Manufacturer of Artistic Memorials,&quot; who bluntly asks why 
it is that he can't do more business at your cemetery, and tells you that 
&quot;so and so&quot; are getting most of the orders for new work. He accuses 
you of giving the, other fellow the tips, and intimates that he can pay as 
large a commission for business sent his way as the other fellow is paying you. 
You indignantly deny the allegation and inform him that his presence and 
language are obtrusive and objectionable. Out he goes in a &quot;huff&quot; and 
you hear him mutter through his teeth that he will &quot;see about this.&quot; 
&ldquo;I will have your scalp yet.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>A few days later your Chairman of Trustees very quietly asks you about it. 
You explain the matter fully, and he says, &quot;All right but be careful, you 
must keep these fellows quiet, for some day some one will believe what these 
fellows say about you.&quot;</p> 
<p>I am sure, however, that you will agree with me that a good Cemetery 
Superintendent needs to know more things than does a man engaged in any other 
line of activity with which we are familiar, and that while it has its troubles 
and annoyances, it also has many compensations and rewards, furnishing as the 
position does so many opportunities to render a service and to do a kindness to 
our fellow beings, and at a time when such service is highly appreciated, and 
bring to us many life long friends, which after all is the greatest reward to 
get in this life.</p> 
<p>And then you think of the satisfaction derived from the effort expended as 
we take hold of a block of land in its crude state, hostile and rebellious and 
watch it yielding day by day to our well directed labors until it finally lies 
before us a beautiful area of undulating lawn, subdivided into lots; and we 
complete the picture by adding at suitable places the choice bits of trees and 
plants, and enjoy that greatest of life's pleasures, the delight of seeing 
things grow, and then the more sordid, material side as we figure the amount of 
money our corporation receives from its sale, many times the cost of purchase 
and development.</p> 
<p>Suppose you are called upon to take charge of a cemetery, or several of 
them, in which there exists, as is frequently the case, a considerable area of 
&quot;old part&quot; and you start in to clean it up and put it in shape. My 
experience is that there is but one right way to go about it, and that is to 
make a clean, through job of it. If you cannot do it all the first season, do 
what you can in a complete manner. Pull out all surplus granite posts; that is, 
all but the four corner bounds; and store them away for some future use, pull 
up the corner ones and with a heavy breaking hammer break off about one foot of 
the bottom end and reset them flush with the surface of the ground so that the 
lawn mowers may be run over them without striking; straighten and clean 
monuments, tablets and grave markets. Remove surplus trees and over-grown 
shrubs, prune those left, dig or trench over the entire surface to the full 
loam depth, re-grade, working out all possible terraces, sod edges and around 
monuments and trees, fertilize with any good commercial fertilizer. If the loam 
is poor and hungry, work in a good liberal quantity of well rotted manure. 
Clean up, re-grade and resurface your avenues and paths and provide for surface 
drainage when necessary, then seed the whole with such grasses as you have 
found by experience to be best adapted to the specific situation. The cost of 
such work is not great when compared to the results obtained.</p> 
<p>I am sure that some of you will ask, &quot;What will you do with lots in 
such an area for which no care provision has been made?&quot; My answer is, 
&quot;Do them just the same, because if you don't, you will find that, left as 
they are now, they will seriously interfere not only with the proper grading of 
the whole tract, but if left uncared for they invariably produce weed seed 
which will inoculate those adjoining and eventually cause you as much or more 
work as will be found necessary to put and keep them in order, in addition to 
the nullification of your efforts to keep the others in good order.</p> 
<p>Then again, are we not under a moral obligation to give a reasonable amount 
of care to any lot sold?&nbsp; Assuming that lots are now sold only with a 
Perpetual Care provision, the entire process of which is under our control, and 
we adjust it by investing a certain part of the purchase money in interest 
bearing securities, the income of which bears the expense of the care of the 
particular lot in question, are those people who purchased their lots before we 
made such provision and conditions in any way to be blamed because the care of 
theirs has not been provided for? Would they not have been willing, yes glad to 
have had us lay aside a part of their purchase money for this purpose? Would 
they not have peen willing to have paid more, than they did for their lots if 
the purchase contract had carried with it a care provision? I feel sure they 
would. When you sum it all up the situation as I see it is this:</p> 
<p>Relatively a few years ago we learned from our experience that we ought to 
get more money for our lots and that we ought to lay aside a certain part of it 
for Perpetual Care. And ever since that time we have been trying to induce the 
owners of lots purchased prior to that time to endow their lots by the payment 
of a certain amount of money mutually agreed upon, varying in volume according 
to the opinion of the officials of the various cemeteries and in this 
commendable effort we have generally met with success, which success in itself 
proves to my mind that they would have made this provision at the time of the 
original purchase had we asked it. Understand me, I would not abate this effort 
in any degree but we still have those with us who cannot now make this 
provision. In many instances the family has become extinct; in others, reverses 
have come and they cannot procure the money. It is true that in most cases they 
have only paid a fraction of the price we would now ask for the same lot but 
they paid us all we asked and would have paid us more if we had demanded it. 
Hence, if we used bad judgment and made a poor bargain for ourselves; I think 
we should take our medicine.</p> 
<p>Whence originated this whole subject of Perpetual Care? Not with the owners 
of lots, neither was it brought about by legislative requirements subsequent to 
an aroused public opinion which has been the cause of many public improvements. 
No! We did it and I am convinced that it is one of the best things we have ever 
done.</p> 
<p>Let me ask. What will you do with these lots ultimately care for them or 
not? They are on your hands and will never be moved away. That they are a 
burden to us and a menace to the welfare of our cemeteries and our lot owners, 
I think you will admit. Being a menace, I am sure that you will eventually care 
for them. My advice is DO IT NOW. May I not borrow a well known advertising 
slogan &quot;Eventually, Why not now?&quot; The satisfaction of pleasing those 
who are too poor to pay for it is great, and this is the class of people who 
most frequently visit the cemetery and who feel the loss of their dead most 
keenly. We have upon a large monument this sentiment engraved upon a polished 
granite surface,&quot; The best part of the record of every man's life is what 
he has done for others.&quot; The thought thus expressed is one we should 
cultivate and keep before us constantly while engaged in our work. Our doing 
for those who cannot do for themselves will bring to us our greatest reward. 
And besides, I firmly believe that if we remove from our cemeteries every foot 
of neglected, uncared for land we will make them so much more attractive than 
they would be if these areas were left undone that we will be able to sell our 
new land for a much higher price, so much higher that we will make money out of 
our efforts. I believe it because that has been the result of my own experience 
and observation.</p> 
<p>With advancing years of experience and observation I am becoming more and 
more convinced that the most attractive and desirable cemetery is the one that 
consists largely of well-made and well-kept lawns, avenues, paths and trees 
with most if not all of t he ornamental plantings placed in the public or 
administrative areas, that is, do not yourself, or permit or encourage in your 
lot owners the planting of beds, graves or borders of lots or lot sections more 
than compelled to do. The old custom of weeping willows or syringas on the lots 
with two beds of scarlet geraniums in the front border is a thing of the past. 
Few if any now want such plantings.</p> 
<p>You will in any section find angles and spaces of unsold land into which 
you may properly and effective plant hardy growths of flowering shrubs or 
herbaceous plants, as well as the dwarf and slow growing broad leaf and 
coniferous evergreens. By all means, however, avoid an epidemic of &ldquo;shrub 
fever&rdquo;. Often have we been advised to &quot;make judicious plantings of 
flowering shrubs?&rdquo;&nbsp; I would advise a careful attention to the 
meaning of the word &quot;judicious&quot; to the end that it may not be 
interpreted as meaning &quot;promiscuous,&quot; as I fear has too often been 
the case.</p> 
<p>On the deciduous shrub proposition we really have two flowering seasons 
here in New England: Spring and Fall. It is useless in a cemetery to try to 
make more out of it. We have read and been told much about the desirable 
effects of foliage all summer and colored bark and fruit effects all winter. 
These are all very well in large group plantings in parks, and for some large 
border plantings on the boundaries of cemeteries but I do not approve their use 
in internal cemetery areas or between or near lots. They are overgrown and 
cumbersome in a very few years and provide an attractive place for harboring 
injurious insects as well as for the depositing of rubbish of all kinds.</p> 
<p>I like a freer use of the spring flowering bulbs those that will live on 
and increase and thrive for years. How the crocus, scillas narcissus von sion, 
poeticus and trumpets in their several varieties do brighten things up and with 
so little thought and care and don't forget the hardly lilies and peonies.<br>
 
&nbsp;<br>
 You can always find desirable locations of them especially along 
the outer edges of group or border plantings of deciduous and broad leaved 
rhododendrons and azaleas.&nbsp; They furnish a most attractive display and at 
a season when they will be abundantly appreciated.&nbsp; I also find great 
satisfaction in plantings of our native ferns in shady, moist places. Their 
cost is trifling, as they can generally be had for the labor of collecting.</p> 
<p>Yes, we surely have abundant cause to be grateful for the opportunity which 
our occupation and position in life have given to us.</p>

<h2>The Making of a Modern Cemetery - Some Reflex Influences and Observations
</h2>  Date Published:&nbsp;  September, 1921  Original Author:&nbsp;  Rev. W. 
G. Evans  South Lyon, Michigan  Original Publication:&nbsp;  AACS Proceedings 
of the 35th Annual Convention 
<p>It would seem to approach the realm of presumption on my part if I were to 
come before an association like this with the purpose of presenting anything 
new in the matter of research or invention in cemetery work.&nbsp; To an 
association of thirty-five years standing holding an annual convention for 
study and discussion there must surely be for you, nothing new under the sun in 
the matter of cemetery development.</p> 
<p>When I found the task of this subject assigned me and went apart to spend a 
few vacation hours in meditation, I discovered that literally interpreted, it 
called for an attempt to do what had been done many times over in the previous 
sessions of your conventions. It was so hard to find a starting point that I 
felt very much in the position that Pat found his friend Mike, after a few 
years sojourn in this country. They came out from the &quot;auld sod&quot; 
together. Both of them had been thoroughly trained in the religious faith of 
the church. Soon after their arrival in this land, circumstances parted them 
and each started to work his way in the new world. Pat remained true to the 
faith of his fathers but Mike fell on evil ways and drifted into infidelity and 
unbelief. In the course of time, the Death Angel reaped and Mike was cut off. 
His last request was that word be sent to his friend Pat, who hastened to him 
but only in time to find his old companion laid out in his best suit of clothes 
in his coffin ready for burial. As he gazed upon the face of his friend his 
emotion burst into exclamation. &quot;Poor Mike! He didn't believe in God and 
he didn't believe in the devil. Poor Mike! He didn't believe in heaven and he 
didn't believe in hell. Poor Mike! He is all dressed up and has no where to 
go&quot;.</p> 
<p>I found the subject as outlined on the program, so large and with so many 
ramifications anyone of which would be worthy the time of a special paper that 
I am taking the liberty of making the terminal facilities of this paper easier 
by confining myself to the subject of Modern Cemetery Making Some Reflex 
Influences and Observations.&quot;</p> 
<p>What I say will be from the standpoint of one outside the office of 
Superintendent yet of one who is sympathetically interested in the work of your 
Association. This interest has been intensified by an extended experience 
associated as a stockholder and director in the development and management of 
at least two City cemeteries and also in the work of reorganizing several 
neglected rural cemeteries. I am also encouraged in addressing you by the 
thought that the chief function of a paper at a convention like this is not so 
much the presentation of new and unheard of material as it is to provide a 
fulcrum around which fruitful discussion may revolve.</p> 
<p>A few observations of the reflex influence of your work may serve to 
hearten any of you who are met by serious discouragement in your work and 
perhaps are debating in your own mind as to whether what you are doing in the 
world is really worth while.&nbsp; I would like to assure you with more than 
ordinary emphasis that the work that you are doing through the auspices of this 
Association of American Superintendents is worthy a place among the fine-arts 
in the realm of education. The work which this association is accomplishing and 
has already accomplished in conserving and improving the landscape and in the 
encouragement of rural art is of the highest value in promoting aesthetic 
culture throughout the land.</p> 
<p>And I want also to assure you that yours would still be a worthy work if 
you accomplished nothing more than what you have already accomplished by 
developing your park system of cemeteries, in providing places of refuge for 
the preservation of bird life. At the annual rate of destruction of our natural 
groves and woods for the purpose merely of material gain, the cemetery parks 
dotted over the countryside are timely substitutes for these in supplying 
important places of refuge for the encouragement of bird migration and 
reproduction; those indispensable friends of mankind which not only add joy to 
life by their presence but are such a large economic asset in the destruction 
of insect pests. Yours is a twofold opportunity in this respect. You are not 
only developing cemetery parks that are sanctuaries for the repose of the 
honored dead, but incidentally these parks are also sanctuaries of the living 
plumage so necessary to our well being.</p> 
<p>Another reflex of the work your association is doing is seen in the matter 
of rural community betterment and is associated with the work of reorganizing 
neglected burial grounds, and it appears to me that there is a splendid 
opportunity in your association to conduct a special work along this line with 
a special department giving expert direction and supervision to this particular 
work.</p> 
<p>That the character of a community and its cemetery often bear a close 
relation to each other might at first thought seem a strained statement; but in 
a life's work spent toward the end of community uplift and rural betterment, 
the speaker has found that the spiritual, moral and social status of a 
community frequently reflects itself in the local cemetery. A personal 
reminiscence will serve as an illustration. Some years ago while serving in one 
of our home mission fields. I was assigned a territory about fifty miles 
square. I was proceeding for the first time toward a small village settlement 
at the extreme of the field to conduct Sunday Evening Worship and take a 
preliminary survey. Speeding along on horse-back through wooded trails, I 
suddenly emerged into the open with the village close in sight. I turned onto a 
by-path which made a short cut from the main trail into the town when suddenly 
my horse stumbled and I was thrown from the saddle. I recovered myself and my 
horse and looking for an explanation I saw where the path had broken away into 
some loose soil. A sweep of the eye disclosed in the gloaming sunset a 
half-fenced enclosure, a few irregular mounds and fewer still, reclining 
headstones. The loose soil into which my horse stumbled was a freshly filled 
grave. The whole area was a commons overrun by the cattle and the swine of the 
village. This was the village cemetery, the sanctuary for the burial of their 
dead. As these facts dawned upon me, forebodings of the work to be done took 
possession of my being and what I afterwards discovered of leadership in that 
place justified my forebodings.</p> 
<p>I will present to you four types of character which were the most 
influential in shaping the life of that community and whose character was 
reflected in their cemetery. The first type represented its professional 
leadership. At my first service in the little neglected chapel of this village, 
a grimy individual with germy hands and dope-set eyes acted as chief official 
and passed his hat for the offering. At the conclusion of the service, he 
introduced himself as the village doctor. His mentality may be judged from this 
conversation. He was voluntarily discussing the recent death of a patient in 
technical terms that I feared neither he nor I understood. I said to him, 
&quot;Doctor, I do not quite understand. Could you tell me in plain English the 
exact cause of her death?&quot; &quot;Well,&quot; he said, &quot;to sum it all 
up, she died from the complete loss of the power of life.&quot; I told him that 
I quite understood him now.</p> 
<p>The second type represented the educational leadership in the person of the 
village teacher. She was a tall, angular, stoical, maiden who had already been 
responsible for educating two generations and who was still doing the same 
things always in the same way and whose habit of reading never extended beyond 
the text books she daily handled before the class.</p> 
<p>A firm of two brothers represented the industrial type of leadership. They 
owned the only industry in the form of a planing mill. It was equipped with a 
worn out engine and a planer. It took two hours to get up steam enough to 
operate and after running for two hours, they were compelled to shut down again 
in order to get a fresh head of steam for another start.</p> 
<p>The last represents the moral type of that community. When I was about to 
leave the chapel after my first Sunday evening visit a young man who was 
lingering about the church door approached me and hesitatingly said, &quot;Say, 
Parson, can you baptize and bury people?&quot; I answered that I was ordained 
for that mission. &quot;Well&quot;, he replied, &quot;I want to get 
married.&quot; I performed that service for him the following week. It was just 
a month later when the same young man was waiting for me again at the chapel 
door. &quot;Well Jack,&quot; I said, &quot;What is on your mind this time? And 
quite unabashed, he inquired, &quot;Say, Parson when can you plan to baptize 
our baby?&quot; Thus a decadent community reflected itself in its neglected 
cemetery.</p> 
<p>In organizing a work of rural uplift in a community of this type, the 
social worker can usually find a starting point for a universal appeal toward 
cooperative effort in the matter of the improvement of the local cemetery and I 
know of communities which have been awakened to many lines of helpful activity 
through the forming of a cemetery association.</p> 
<p>That there is a need for work in many places along the line of cemetery 
reorganization can plainly be seen by a casual survey of the whole field of 
cemetery operation. For the purpose of this survey, cemeteries might be classed 
under four heads:<br>
 &nbsp;<br>
 1. Business corporations having an eye to 
dividend production.<br>
 2. Association controlled and non-dividend. <br>
 3. 
Municipally controlled.<br>
 4. Church controlled. </p> 
<p>Someone has observed that these might further be classified under 
organized, reorganized and disorganized. Some are examples of good management 
while others are samples of quiescent non-management. Many municipally 
controlled cemeteries especially in larger centers are well managed while in 
some of the townships, they are the victims in management of the worst 
roustabout the town shelters. The tendency to lift these from the realm of 
political management by transferring them to non-political associations seems 
to lead to a better and more economic administration.</p> 
<p>Many church owned cemeteries, likewise, are under good management while the 
neglect of many others is coincident with the decline of the rural church. 
These might best be improved through the forming of a community association. 
Many of these cemeteries decline because of the presence of a well organized 
city cemetery within easy reach. The advantage of perpetual care is causing 
many removals that will eventually deplete them and their usefulness will cease.
</p> 
<p>To reorganize or make modern any existing cemetery is a matter of varied 
approach. In attempting this process, one immediately meets a variety of 
obstacles including indifference to higher ideals, prejudice against any 
change, political antagonism, legal difficulties, lack of finances, or 
experienced management or proper records, etc. All these must be overcome with 
patience according to the local circumstances. To aid this end, an educational 
propaganda must be instituted to arouse a public consciousness favorable to the 
change.</p> 
<p>Next, a study of the laws of the particular state must be in order that a 
properly organized association may be formed and the lands of old cemeteries 
legally transferred.</p> 
<p>The problem of finance usually looms up very large. The success of this 
must depend on the initiative of the leaders. The permanent revenue usually 
comes from the sale of lots supplemented by municipal grants and other means. 
It is necessary also to establish a permanent up-keep fund if permanency is to 
be assured. This may not be such a difficult problem as appears on the surface. 
In dealing with this problem recently, the writer knows of a community where a 
number of citizens came voluntarily and pledged in bequests from $100 to $1000 
each, toward such a fund. A complete canvass will provide for this fund a start 
toward a fair endowment. Another possibility for aid toward this fund would be 
to educate lot holders to invest in this fund a goodly percent of the amount 
they would otherwise spend for monuments. An important point to make clear and 
insist upon is that bequests for this fund are not to be used solely for 
individual graves but should go into a common fund for upkeep of the whole 
cemetery.</p> 
<p>The problem of management for a superintendent is of final importance. If 
no one with previous experience is available for this office, then someone with 
foresight and hindsight and the ability and desire to learn must be chosen and 
given every needed encouragement and help for the task. By such an effort, a 
strong organization through patience and devotion may eventually come to pass.
</p> 
<p>Before concluding, I would like to have said some things on &quot;The 
Making of a Modern Cemetery&quot; as a scientific process of modern art but, as 
I stated at the beginning of this paper there are so many departments that the 
work of these is best presented by the specialists who are working in these 
departments. I venture the observation, however, that the type of cemetery 
which best works out this ideal is a business corporation based on strict 
business administration. Successful business competition demands the highest 
type of efficient management and careful development from every standpoint.</p> 
<p>I conclude by again assuring you as an observer from the outside, that the 
work you are doing through your association fills a large place in the nation's 
welfare.<br>

<h2>The Importance of Landscape Engineering Work in Planning Cemeteries</h2>  
Date Published:&nbsp;  September, 1921  Original Author:&nbsp;  Major E.B. 
Wilhelm  Grandlawn, Detroit, Michigan  Original Publication:&nbsp;  AACS 
Proceedings of the 35th Annual Convention 
<p>In discussing the subject assigned &quot;The Importance of Landscape 
Engineering Work in Planning Cemeteries&quot; it is not my pleasure to dwell 
upon the artistic side of the question. I shall not speak of the magnolia 
grandiflora whose myriad blossoms twinkle in their setting of green as star 
lights in a velvet sky, of an air redolent with the perfume of many blossoms, 
or resonant with the song of sweet-voiced birds. Nor, shall I attempt to carry 
you in word-built boats along the banks of crystal waters, where the wave lips 
are dimpled into kisses for the lilies on the shore. But rather, I shall dwell 
upon the subject of producing the beautiful, long, green foliage which your 
stockholders long to behold upon the date of the annual dividend-Landscape 
Engineering-with the purpose of producing a businesslike, clean cut paying 
proposition without frills or fancy work agreeable to the eye of the public.</p>
<p>In the not too far distant future we must better correlate the work of the 
Landscape Artist and the Landscape Engineer, or recognize in them two utterly 
distinct professions, performing diversified missions in the field of cemetery 
development. The present translation of the two professions defined by nothing 
other than the great majority of their own works shows the two terms to be as 
widely indifferent as day is from night. With the Landscape Artist who plans 
for beauty alone, who creates a picture with the same spirit that his brother 
enjoys when he lays colors upon canvas, there is no criticism held, provided 
his work be done under conditions favorable to this type of treatment. When the 
appearance is paramount and means unlimited for the purpose, it is most 
assuredly the mission of this artist to allow his artistic sense every latitude 
and produce, to the best of his ability, a monument to his art.</p> 
<p>In the planning of the cemetery, his artistic trend must, on the contrary, 
be constantly tempered by knowledge and experience in actual cemetery operation 
built on a foundation of engineering, training. There are limitations in the 
search for the artistic which must be recognized to a greater extent in 
cemetery building. These limitations are three-the cost or construction, the 
cost of operation and the cost of maintenance. Each step in cemetery planning 
must be weighed carefully in the balance, by all three standards, before a 
decision is reached. It must be remembered that construction cost is but the 
first cost, that certain short cuts which appear feasible to the cemetery 
designer and which on the spur of the moment are desirable, due to the pressure 
created by lack of time or finance, often sway the judgment to unwise decisions 
for which operation and maintenance must pay many times during the life of the 
cemetery.</p> 
<p>Construction is the first step and a slippery one. During the construction 
period, the landscape engineer must be continually alert to reaching proper 
adjustments between the construction cost, the operating cost and the 
maintenance cost. For only during the construction period can the desired 
savings be affected at a minimum of expense.</p> 
<p> Too frequently do we hear the boast that a new cemetery was placed on a 
sales basis in an incredibly short time and at unusually low costs. These 
figures are usually based on acres graded, rather than on yards of earth 
removed on lineal feet of roadway, completed without mention of sub grade 
conditions or specifications on material and method of placing. Drains also are 
often considered as outlets for storm water through the catch basins, although 
the drain laid to collect the soil water after a short study of strata and 
incline would produce dryer burial ground and a better labor condition at an 
initial cost quite favorable by comparison. First cost and speed in 
construction are desirable. Both must be given full weight, especially during a 
time when completion of burial ground means a return on a large expenditure, 
but never must the cost of operation and maintenance be forgotten. Thinking in 
the abstract, dreaming of effects and guessing at results will not bring the 
answer. Real study, plans based on actual conditions and available records of 
past cemetery operations are the only safe guides.</p> 
<p>In modern practice the initial action in planning the cemetery is the 
topographical survey, usually worked out with care and precision. The second 
step, to which many of our modern cemeteries bear mute witness, is the location 
of roadways on the topographic map obtained, with an utter disregard for any of 
the information thereon. Perfect circles rapidly appear straight, broad avenues 
intersect contour lines with reckless abandon. All energies are bent on 
producing a fancy map, regardless of the mounting prices of steam shovel and 
scraper operation. Thousands of yards of earth are moved to fit this beautiful 
plat but seldom do pencil and paper make contact to determine the amount of 
earthwork involved in the choice of several routes.</p> 
<p>In selection of roadways another vital element is frequently forgotten 
namely the trend of travel within the cemetery's limits. Ton miles mean money 
for road upkeep just as surely as they mean money for truck and auto upkeep. 
Cemetery employees must use these roadways for transportation their time and 
the wear and tear of cemetery equipment is an expense. The construction of long 
sections at right angles to each other prevents the continuation of radial 
drives and defeats direct travel. While roadways should, in the main, be 
curved, they should approach the radial plan from the cemetery entrance in the 
same scheme that modern city planning recognizes as good practice for main 
thoroughfares into the business section.</p> 
<p>On every industrial project under consideration today, whether it be the 
maintenance of an automobile factory, the construction of a building or the 
operation of a cemetery we must consciously or unconsciously make provision for 
those intangible costs known as &quot;Overhead and Contingency&quot;. The 
contractor adds a certain percent to his bid precedes it with these items and 
presents his figure for doing the work. The Cemetery Superintendent, wrestling 
with the cost of &quot;Perpetual Care&quot;, lays aside his actuary tables unit 
costs and integral calculus and puts down a figure which he thinks will cover 
&quot;the rest of it&quot;. &quot;The rest of it&quot; means our aforesaid 
items, persistent overhead and contingency. He knows his roadways, park spaces, 
drains, buildings, transportation and a dozen other items must be paid for from 
cemetery profits that directly they do not earn one cent. That is overhead. He 
knows that when he set that mausoleum under the big tree, some day someone must 
settle for the damage done when the tree blew down. He knows that when he 
bought the poorly designed catch basin grating, which will some day slip out of 
place and break an ankle, he set a trap for a damage suit. He knows that when 
the sharp turn was placed at the foot of the steep roadway grade he built a 
scenic setting for an auto accident. These are some of the constituents of 
&quot;Contingency&quot;.</p> 
<p>Neither of these items can be entirely eliminated. Every business must 
carry their cost; but the measure of that cost is usually the measure of the 
success of the business under association. The Cemetery Superintendent with his 
zealous care and careful observation cannot undo all these errors within 
reasonable cost or human ingenuity. The theories of the efficiency engineer can 
but in small measure assist in alleviating bed rock circumstance. The time to 
reduce the cost of Overhead and Contingency begins with a vengeance the day the 
cemetery is planned and dwindles away to nothing on the day the cemetery is 
abandoned forever.</p> 
<p>In conclusion, let us ever keep in mind, when planning the cemetery, that 
it is a business proposition as well as a picture. That the grounds planned 
with an eye to operation and maintenance cost must in time, have the better 
financial condition to preserve appearance. From the moment that plans are 
begun, we must never forget that overhead is a factor in maintenance, whether 
the project be considered on the perpetual care basis or individual upkeep and 
that moneys spent on overhead are never visible.</p> 
<p>The complete design of the cemetery cannot be left to the artist alone. 
While every element of cemetery construction must be considered from the 
standpoint of beauty and aesthetic value, the weight of construction, operation 
and maintenance must be found and recognized at the time of beginning.</p>

<h2>Succeeding Success</h2>  Date Published:&nbsp;  September, 1921  Original 
Author:&nbsp;  Arthur Nuessle  Lakewood Cemetery, Minneapolis, Minnesota  
Original Publication:&nbsp;  AACS Proceedings of the 35th Annual Convention 
<p>A pioneer in the development of the present day cemetery, Mr. A. W. Hobert, 
former superintendent of Lakewood, Minneapolis, at the time of his death a year 
ago last March left innumerable of those signs which mark the genius. For 31 
years Mr. Hobert devoted his best energies to Lakewood and the esteem in which 
that cemetery is held today is due almost entirely to his efforts, his 
imagination and far-sighted methods of management.</p> 
<p>Following in the footsteps of one who has been so unanimously successful is 
a task indeed. The indelible marks of Mr. Hobert's keen individuality are 
apparent to one who has watched the progress which Lakewood has made and I 
confess that I imagined myself a second Atlas, bearing the weight of the world 
on my shoulders when I took over the management of the cemetery last year. This 
feeling so strong during the first few weeks gradually changed into one of 
gratitude that I was given the opportunity to carry on the work of a man who, 
in my mind at least, bore the stamp of master.</p> 
<p>To those who are unacquainted with the accomplishments of Mr. Hobert at 
Lakewood, it might be helpful to have outlined the cardinal features of his 
labors. Geniuses, I have noticed, always leave one feat or example that 
elevates them above the mass of ordinary struggling mortals. And so it was with 
Mr. Hobert and I believe the work which I am about to describe will prove the 
assertion.</p> 
<p>When Mr. Hobert made his first appearance at Lakewood, the cemetery was 
little more than a woods, poorly landscaped and even more poorly managed. The 
tract comprised something more than 170 acres, but some portions of this were 
unsuitable for use. Mr. Hobert's first move was to put the institution on a 
paying basis, which was indeed no small task and thereafter he devoted himself 
to rebuilding that part of the cemetery which already had been laid out. His 
efforts even today are visible, for his skill in landscape gardening changed 
the appearance of the older portion of the tract from one of mediocrity to one 
of perfection.</p> 
<p>Mr. Hobert, I believe, was one of the first superintendents to recognize 
the beauty of the lawn-plan and also one of the first to strenuously advocate 
this system of gardening. His first mission in the early days was one of 
education rather than achievement, and Lakewood now prides itself on having the 
greater portion of its land under the lawn plan. Mr. Hobert also insisted that 
good roads played no unimportant part in the proper development of a 
present-day's cemetery. As a result, Lakewood now has the highest form of 
Tarvia roads throughout-roads which I am certain cannot be surpassed any place 
in the country.</p> 
<p>Probably the greatest single monument to Mr. Hobert's farsightedness in the 
matter of permanent improvements is the mortuary chapel which was completed in 
November, 1910. Lakewood, as you may know is as near a public institution as 
possible; that is, money-making is not its primary object. With this in mind, 
it is possible that Mr. Hobert had a freer rein than numerous superintendents 
in the country, but the chapel erected at an initial cost of $150,000 and which 
could not be duplicated for twice that amount today certainly justified that 
expense. Permanency, sanitation and beauty, the three architectural requisites, 
are embodied in the chapel. Permanency is found in the granite foundations and 
walls; sanitation in that each part of the interior can easily be kept clean 
and beauty in the exquisite mosaic mural decorations which cannot be surpassed 
on this side of the Atlantic.</p> 
<p>The materials entering into the construction of the chapel were of the most 
imperishable nature. The walls are of reddish gray granite, the dome and roof 
of Gustavino tile with an outer covering of Spanish wall tile embedded in 
elastic cement. The interior is a most interesting and valuable example of the 
mosaic artists' work, the walls, ceiling and dome being designed and executed 
in Venetian mosaic, imported for the purpose and set by Italians of great 
ability. These decorations are set off by a harmonious combination of marbles 
in floor, wainscoting and stairs. A retiring room for ladies and a robing space 
for the minister are provided and a private chamber on the main floor allows 
the family of the deceased to remain as secluded as in a home and yet have 
within full view, the body and the officiating clergyman. The chapel proper is 
connected with the crematory by a hydraulic lift.</p> 
<p>Another important achievement of Mr. Hobert was reclaiming 40 acres of 
swamp land in the Southwest corner of the tract, which until a few years before 
his death had remained practically useless. In reclaiming the land Mr. Hobert 
dug one portion lower than the surrounding land, threw the earth thus 
accumulated on the nearest adjoining portion of the cemetery and thus in one 
stroke added a lake to the other landscape charms of Lakewood and availed for 
practical usage a considerable portion of land.</p> 
<p>I spent five years under the tutorship, if it might be called tutorship of 
Mr. Hobert, and my one ambition is to carry out the plans of development which 
he many times, previous to his death, outlined to me. At the same time, I hope 
to put into actuality some of my own ideas. In the past year I have constructed 
a thoroughly modern garage and stable, entirely removed from the cemetery, and 
I am now at work in wrecking the old greenhouses and replacing them in 
thoroughly modern fashion. I will have 75,000 square feet of glass in the new 
greenhouses.</p> 
<p>Lakewood has natural advantages which I do not believe have been worked to 
their fullest extent, and in addition to following the policy of Mr. Hobert in 
a general way, I am making an honest endeavor to put the cemetery on a par with 
any now existing in the United States. The facilities for such an 
accomplishment are within my grasp, the directors of the institution are 
farsighted business men and with reasonably intelligent management, I am 
confident that the task which I have laid out for myself is not an impossible 
one.</p>

<h2>Perpetual Care</h2>  Date Published:&nbsp;  September, 1921  Original 
Author:&nbsp;  W.C. Grassau  Greenwood Cemetery, Brooklyn, NY  Original 
Publication:&nbsp;  AACS Proceedings of the 35th Annual Convention 
<p>These two words &quot;Perpetual Care&quot; seem to be differently construed 
in various localities, according to my observations. Some Cemeteries, which 
were started years ago and operated on a stock issue plan, felt it necessary to 
expend as little as possible on the general improvements and maintenance of 
said Cemeteries, in order that the dividends on the stock issued might be of 
such proportions annually, as to more than satisfy the holders of said stock. 
Under ordinary circumstances, Cemeteries of this kind were good paying 
propositions for the stockholders only, but like unto the golden goose, their 
days, or rather years, were numbered, for very obvious reasons. Many of the 
unsightly Cemeteries, which have been to a great extent the cause of more or 
less antagonistic legislation in my opinion, would never have been created had 
not the lure of the substantial dividend been the paramount factor. Other 
cemeteries of the same kind realize that the change in times, customs and 
expectations, etc. of the public made necessary changes in methods also, and 
they established a system called &ldquo;Perpetual Care&quot; under which, as 
far as I can discern, the lot owners or purchasers are being called upon to 
provide for the better care of the Cemeteries in general, in order that the 
dividends which have obtained for many years may not be materially lessened. Of 
course, in cases of this kind, perpetual care is not so represented to the lot 
owners, whose plots undoubtedly receive care commensurate with the amount paid 
but the fact remains that the more lot owners who provide care of this kind, 
the better the appearance of' the Cemeteries without increased costs to the 
various Corporations operating them.</p> 
<p>Other Cemeteries conducted along different lines by Corporations that are 
satisfied with modest profits or dividends, feel that the good appearance of 
well kept grounds is of just as much concern to the management as to those 
whose beloved ones are buried there. They therefore, are willing to curtail the 
larger dividends, to a more or less degree and &quot;cast their bread upon the 
waters&quot; as it were, fully realizing that well maintained places of burial 
are the ones that attract the buying public.</p> 
<p>Then again, there are those Cemeteries, from the operation of which no 
person or set of persons derives any financial benefit and Cemeteries of this 
kind endeavor at all times, to give such care to their entire grounds, without 
additional charge to the lot owners, as will cause the communities in which 
they are located, to feel proud of their existence. Cemeteries of this kind, 
and in fact all others, which have existed for a number of years, find included 
among their lot owners, many who have met with such reverses as to preclude the 
payment of even small annual charges for the care of their individual lets, and 
the civic pride of these corporations prevents a state of dilapidation to 
exist, even though they are not remunerated for the small expense required to 
prevent the prevalence of unsightly conditions.</p> 
<p>To be sure, no Cemetery can afford to maintain the individual plots in 
absolutely perfect condition, including the frequent cutting of the grass, 
watering, fertilizing, re-grading and seeding or sodding together with the 
maintenance of the monumental work etc., without an extra charge therefore. 
Even if a prohibitive purchase price is placed upon the lots offered for sale, 
the conditions which might arise in the future could not be humanly 
anticipated, by reason of the great difference in ideas and tastes, regarding 
styles and sizes of monuments, mausoleums, floral decoration, etc. Hence the 
effort on the part of many Cemeteries to convince their lot owners of the 
wisdom of making such arrangements with the various corporations, as will 
insure the keeping of their plots and the appurtenances, in perfect order in 
perpetuity, and we now come to another phase of &quot;Perpetual Care&quot;.</p> 
<p>In this connection, I have had a little experience and my observations 
prove that a Cemetery which is indifferently maintained generally is not the 
one which makes-forward strides in securing perpetual care endowments. Some 
persons will argue that if a Cemetery is too well kept as a whole, at the 
expense of the corporation, the incentive for the lot owner to provide for 
perpetual care is removed, and that the number of deposits therefore will be 
decidedly less than in those Cemeteries, where a very marked contrast between 
the endowed lots and those not similarly provided for, it permitted to exist.
</p> 
<p>This, in my opinion, is a decidedly mistaken opinion, for the simple 
reason, that before a lot owner will even consider the idea of presenting to 
the Cemetery a sum of money for perpetual care he must have confidence and 
trust in the management of that corporation. Gentlemen, I assure you that this 
confidence and trust is begotten in no other way, than by the demonstrated 
attitude of the corporation, regarding its organization, maintenance, and last 
but not least, its consideration of the interests of its lot owners.</p> 
<p>Having secured the confidence of the lot owner to the extent of considering 
seriously the matter of perpetual care, it is necessary for the Cemetery to 
estimate, in each case, the amount needed to provide for the proper, perpetual 
care of the lot. After having learned the exact wishes of the lot owner, as to 
the desired care that is, or will be expected, it seems to me to be absolutely 
imperative by reason of varying conditions and individual requirements and 
tastes, that these estimates should be made by someone, who from practical 
experience, is in a position to compute the cost per annum to the Cemetery for 
caring for the plots, including the maintenance of any monumental work, 
re-sodding, fertilizing, etc., and the annual expense of any floral decoration 
which might be specified.</p> 
<p>All estimates should be made in duplicate and properly filed for future 
reference, and no agreement to give a plot proper perpetual care should be 
entered upon, unless the estimated amount needed, is deposited. Accepting 
amounts less than those needed, in order to oblige the lot owner or depositor, 
or to show gains in the general fund left for this purpose, only leads to 
future trouble and dissatisfaction. When a deposit has been made for the care 
of a lot, the next thing of most importance is the quality of the service 
rendered in return, m order that the confidence of the depositor may not be 
destroyed.</p> 
<p>In justice alike to the party of the first part and the party of the second 
part, the need for detailed cost keeping, charges, etc., is self-evident.</p> 
<p>When the deposit has been made for the care of a lot, a special ledger 
account should be opened therefore, showing date of deposit, lot number, 
section number, name of depositor amount paid, amount of annual interest 
allowed, and a notation should be made of just what the Cemetery has agreed to 
do for the amount paid, in accordance with the estimate, which has been 
previously made.</p> 
<p>The foreman in charge of the department should be given this information in 
duplicate and thereafter the plot should be designated and considered as 
Account No. ____. From the moment the lot is endowed, all items of expense of 
any kind should be recorded and checked.</p> 
<p>Whenever, in the course of events, the plot is given attention a time slip 
dated, showing the amount of labor, materials etc., employed should be made out 
by the foreman in charge, and these time slips should be left at the office 
daily.</p> 
<p>After said slips are received at the office, they should be checked up in 
order to determine whether or not the total number of hours of labor for which 
the company must pay the men assigned to the perpetual care work on that day, 
is accounted for by the time slips referred to, and the items should be posted 
in a day book.</p> 
<p>To record fractional parts of an hour of labor, would not only involve an 
immense amount of extra work and detail, but would include no allowance for the 
time lost by the men going from one plot to another, neither would the Cemetery 
be compensated for the cost of the tools and other items of overhead expense.
</p> 
<p>The total number of hours charged against the care of these lots daily, 
should therefore never be less than those paid for by the Cemetery, neither 
should the total exceed the cost, by so large a margin that the overhead 
expense including all items, which can be honestly included under this head, 
cannot be reasonably accounted for by the difference.</p> 
<p>The charges for the day book account should be posted monthly into the 
ledger account bearing the same number, and at the end of the year, all of the 
accounts should be totaled and balanced. No hesitancy should be exhibited in 
showing these accounts, at any time to the lot owners, if so requested.</p> 
<p>The working out of this kind of a system is a task which requires 
considerable time and thought on the part of the management and it means also 
the instruction and education of the various foremen, before success can be 
achieved.</p> 
<p>At the Cemetery, with which I have the pleasure of being connected, we 
believe we have in operation a system along the lines above mentioned, which 
causes this department to be handled in a manner that is apparently meeting 
with the unqualified approval of the lot owners, as well as the Trustees of the 
Cemetery.</p> 
<p>This statement is corroborated, I believe, by the fact that we have now 
3750 individual accounts for the care of which about $2,500,000 has been 
deposited by lot owners.<br>
 Local conditions vary so much, that I would not 
presume to say to you, that the system employed at Green Wood Cemetery, is the 
only correct system, and is the one which should be used by all Cemeteries 
throughout the country.</p> 
<p>Efficiency Engineers, in which class I do not claim to be included, would 
no doubt, be able to forward to each member, by mail, for a certain 
consideration, the complete formula for a system which would prove absolutely 
accurate and efficient in all Cemeteries alike throughout the country, 
irrespective of size, financial conditions, local conditions, or in fact, any 
and all of the conditions, which exist in the various sections of the country 
to worry the Trustees, to say nothing of the Superintendents, here assembled.
</p> 
<p>One of the greatest factors in the development and retention of the 
confidence and support of the lot owners, is the keeping of these perpetual 
care records in such a definite and open manner, that the lot owners' 
themselves can readily understand them.</p> 
<p>When a perpetual care system is developed to a considerable size, and many 
lots have been endowed, the unreasonable or &quot;cranky&quot; depositor, who 
feels that he is not being justly treated, is bound to appeal and the fact that 
the Cemetery can demonstrate exactly how the interest in each case has been 
expended, and on what dates the different items of expense were actually 
incurred, is the very best means of pacifying persons of this kind, and of 
preventing the often threatened law suit.</p> 
<p>I have tried to outline&bull; in a manner which you can readily understand, 
the principles which are to my mind uppermost in the successful administration 
of a perpetual care system or department.</p> 
<p>The exact method of handling the time slips, ledgers, etc. in my opinion 
are best devised by the various individual superintendents, in accordance with 
the conditions under which they must labor.</p> 
<p>In conclusion, allow we to say that there is one danger ever present and 
which should be borne in mind by all of us, and that is the fact, proven to me 
by personal experience in the past, that too much system can be employed, and 
in order to maintain &quot;too much system&quot;, overhead expenses become 
top-heavy, and to the average mind bewildering, thus defeating the real object 
for which designed.</p>

<h2>Little Things Indispensable In Cemeteries</h2>  Date Published:&nbsp;  
September, 1921  Original Author:&nbsp;  S.J. Perrott  Ferncliff Cemetery, 
Springfield, Ohio  Original Publication:&nbsp;  AACS Proceedings of the 35th 
Annual Convention 
<p>As one of the newer members of this Association, and with memories still 
fresh in mind of the education gained from the Conventions of the last few 
years which it has been his privilege to attend, and of previous conventions 
about which it was his privilege to read, the writer has been nursing the hope 
that he might again, in attending this convention, come as a student who is 
permitted to pursue a post graduate course in the profession of his choice and 
receive instructions from teachers of long and active experience in the courses 
which lead to an understanding of better methods, better and more complete 
equipment, and newer applications. As a human sponge, if you please, absorbing 
all the good things given out by others and hoping to retain them until such 
time as his own problems might call them into use.</p> 
<p>However, we can learn that the plans and devices of men are never certain, 
and often, what we have accepted as facts prove to be but visions and without 
foundation.</p> 
<p>Thus were we impressed when our good friend, upon whom was imposed the 
chairmanship of this Convention Committee, asked for a contribution to this 
program, even though extending to the writer the privilege of selecting his own 
subject.</p> 
<p>At the same time this (favor) was extended, we observed an article which 
appeared in the Public Press reciting a request made by a leading magazine 
publisher in which Mr. Roger W. Babson was asked to write, detailing some line 
of business or experimentation which had not been thoroughly tried out and 
traced to a successful conclusion.</p> 
<p>In comparison, it seems that the various questions with which the 
Superintendent deals have been as thoroughly covered at one time or another in 
the history of this Association as have other lines of business and 
experimentation in the rest of the business world.</p> 
<p>For this reason may we be permitted to digress from dealing with any 
subject, singly, but rather to touch upon several little things which enter 
into the work of caring for a cemetery.</p> 
<p>In the discharge of the manifold duties of the Cemetery Superintendent and 
in variety of equipment needed in his work there are several things which might 
be referred to as Little Essentials. Many of these which we will mention are, 
on doubt, employed by all Superintendents, and all are perhaps employed by 
some; many little conveniences which when once adopted and used are considered 
by the user as indispensable.</p> 
<p>These are being added to as conditions in various sections and at various 
times require and as methods improve in the general conduct of business.</p> 
<p>Changes may seem to be taking place very slowly, yet, always abreast with 
the times and one need not have been connected with the work for many years in 
order to note marked improvements.</p> 
<p>Road building, sewer construction, grading, concrete mixing and other lines 
of work have called into use a new and extensive line of power equipment.</p> 
<p>The power lawn mower is fast coming into favor where areas of unobstructed 
lawn permit its use, and it may be safe to say that its introduction into the 
Cemetery will have its influence toward the elimination of obstructive mounds 
and raised markers in Cemeteries where these obstructions still exist.</p> 
<p>The little edger, or trimmer, for cutting closely around monuments and 
trees, or on borders where the lawnmower fails to reach, taking the place of 
shears or sickle is one of our best time savers.<br>
 For many years the dump 
cart had its place as an indispensable tool in the Cemetery but has been 
displaced by the dump wagon, and for much of the work the dump wagon has now 
given way to truck and trailers.</p> 
<p>The trailer will also, in a general way, displace the wheel-barrow taking 
the place of that long used tool by the side of the excavation and the soil or 
debris will be conveyed directly to the dumping grounds, and the driveways will 
no longer be marred by particles of clay or suffer loss of material through 
shoveling from their surface.</p> 
<p>To how many other uses trailers may be put, and how much time will be saved 
in handling material we will not attempt to enumerate.</p> 
<p>Protection of the lawn at the time of a burial has long since been taken 
care of by the use of the earth-cabinet placed by the side of the grave, 
keeping the earth which is to be used for refilling in a neat and compact form 
and leaving the lawn unsoiled after the burial has been completed. This cabinet 
was introduced to this Association by means of an illustrated talk given by one 
of its members several years ago, and we believe has now come into very general 
use.</p> 
<p>The canopy with side enclosures protecting patrons against the heat of the 
sun or against cold winds and storm, or used as a means of giving privacy to 
those who are laying away their dead; this, with the heavy ground covering of 
matting or other suitable material to be used when the ground is cold or damp 
provides a means of safety and comfort and has become a Cemetery necessity.</p> 
<p>The lowering device, adding dignity to the burial service by its slow and 
noiseless operation and if desired, permitting the casket to rest in view of 
relatives and friends of the deceased, thereby saving them the severe nervous 
shock which we have all many times witnessed when the casket was lowered from 
sight by means of straps, accompanied by their addending noises, and handled by 
pall-bearers unfit because of age or lack of experience.</p> 
<p>Grave decorations or linings which may be more or less elaborate with 
settings of ferns and palms and other hot house plants, or a simple covering of 
the earth with boughs and draperies which hide the walls of the grave; but 
whether the lining be elaborate or simple, much has been done toward softening 
the harshness of the old time mode of burial and your people are permanently 
impressed and their minds are eased by the beauty of the picture.</p> 
<p>The public is being educated in recent years to expect the best in service 
and is pleased to pay a reasonable amount for it.</p> 
<p>Debris baskets placed convenient to the avenues for the deposit of papers 
and withered bouquets and partially hidden by low plantings are not conspicuous 
and do much toward keeping the grounds free from those unsightly objects which 
would otherwise be blown about to lodge in the shrubbery or to litter drives 
and lawns. Lot owners with scarcely an exception take pride in helping to keep 
the grounds clean and instead of throwing trash upon the avenues will go out of 
their way to use the baskets.</p> 
<p>Tomato cans, milk bottles, and the old china pitcher as receptacles for 
flowers have been replaced by the double cylindrical bouquet holder which is 
set into the grave or at its foot the top level with the sod, out of the way of 
the lawn mower, and when not in use is also not in sight.</p> 
<p>Still fresh in our minds is a very minute description of the uses and 
advantages or the alarm and telephone system as operated in not a few 
Cemeteries. By their use communications are quickly established between the 
office and workmen on the grounds: attendants are notified of the approach of 
the funeral cortege and know from the signal where to meet it. The 
Superintendent, if out on the grounds, may be called or he may readily get in 
touch with any workman to whom he wishes to deliver a message through a signal 
from the bell and the use of the phone.</p> 
<p>The advantages of this equipment can be fully appreciate even in Cemeteries 
which do not cover large areas.</p> 
<p>We may not be predicting too much, perhaps, in the presumption that future 
equipment for this purpose will be minus the troublesome wires which if strung 
on trees are sometimes grounded by the winds, but radio stations will be 
installed and workmen will be equipped with vast pocket editions of the 
wireless phone.</p> 
<p>Numerous other articles of equipment which might well be classed with 
essentials could be mentioned, not the least of which from point of time and 
frequent service are the pick and shovel. Little need be said except their 
having been used since the burial of the Patriarchs, and the probability that 
they will not be displaced so long as immigration laws permit the landing of 
men to use them.</p> 
<p>Turning now to the office, we find in. a steel sectional cabinet all the 
paraphernalia for quick reference and for permanent and compact record, Use of 
the card system of indexing deeds and interments facilitates locating lots and 
graves, plans of lots drawn to a scale, and showing location of all graves, 
memorials and trees make it possible to give exact information and to transact 
business with dispatch. This is especially appreciated by the patron when he is 
waiting for information on the phone, or when planning for an interment and 
manifests a nervous anxiety to avoid delay that he may the sooner return to his 
family and home. Duplicate plats for the owner of the lot may quickly be traced 
and plans for the future use of the lot be indicated.</p> 
<p>Printed forms upon which all orders are received, uniform in size for 
convenient filing; the autograph, making duplicate copies for office and 
grounds. Filing cases for standing orders such as Special and Perpetual care. 
Cost sheets, distributing time for various items of labor, and last but of much 
interest to the Superintendent, a cabinet for his literature, his books on 
subjects of horticulture and landscape gardening, Rules and Regulations, which 
are always convenient for reference, Convention reports, and the 
Superintendents Digest, which comes to our desk every month, &quot;Park and 
Cemetery&quot;.</p>

<h2>The Effect of Increased Costs on Cemetery Charges</h2>  Date 
Published:&nbsp;  September, 1920  Original Author:&nbsp;  J.M. Driscoll  
Brookline, MA  Original Publication:&nbsp;  AACS Proceedings of the 34th Annual 
Convention 
<p>Cemeteries render certain services which may be divided into two classes: 
First, those for which direct charges are made, such as providing burial lots 
and opening graves; second, those for which no direct charge is made, as for 
instance, maintaining avenues, shelters and office facilities. Inasmuch as the 
cost of furnishing and maintaining avenues and buildings is provided for in 
different ways by the various cemeteries, this paper will treat of those 
services for which direct charges are usually made. Everyone on whom the 
responsibility of superintending a cemetery rests has certainly been 
confronted, and probably will continue to be, with the difficulty of adjusting 
charges to meet the ever increasing costs. To some the difficulty of securing 
sufficient labor and a fair output has been perhaps more urgent than that of 
securing sufficient funds to pay those they have. The output per man per hour 
has generally decreased as the number of hours&rsquo; labor per day increased. 
The actual cost of operations must be known to intelligently fix the proper 
charges for these operations.</p> 
<p>For a concrete case, perhaps foundations for monuments furnish a good 
example. If labor costs were 15 cents per cubic foot and material costs 17 
cents per cubic foot and profit or overhead was 8 cents, foundations were built 
for 40 cents a cubic foot. When labor advances to 45 cents and material to 40 
cents and profit and overhead is still 25 percent, the sum of labor and 
material costs the charge per cubic foot should be $1.06. The cost of 
foundation includes excavating and removing earth, very frequently three 
handlings, to say nothing of wheeling and teaming. The size of the foundation 
is in very many cases so small that extra material must be excavated, to give a 
man room to work, and then replaced and the surface re-sodded. The sand, stone 
and cement must be wheeled sometimes fifty or more yards. Where the headstones 
are set by outsiders, no matter how carefully, there is inevitably more or less 
repair necessary to the lawn surfaces. The high costs of monumental work is 
doing more to reduce the size of monuments and headstones than all the cemetery 
superintendent's advice and counsel to lot owners ever could. Sometimes the 
maker of a two by one headstone will compare the cost of a cemetery foundation, 
containing about twelve cubic feet, with the cubic yard price of mass concrete 
in engineering work requiring thousands of cubic yards. But let not his 
comparison or the unthinking lot owner's amazement at &quot;such a terrible 
price&quot; deter the superintendent from figuring all the elements of cost 
when readjusting his foundation prices to a higher level.</p> 
<p>The charges for opening graves are so largely a matter of labor. whether in 
the field or in the office that the percent of increase paid grave diggers for 
this labor applied to former charges is somewhere near the proper charge. 
However, in many cemeteries the interment charge formerly included besides the 
labor of digging, filling and removing surplus earth, the use of the lowering 
device, the laying of board walks, covering with evergreen and even the use of 
tent and chapel. Whether it is wise to continue to give all these extras under 
one charge or whether it would be better to make some, or all of these, the 
matter of extra charges, rests with the particular cemetery. In a cemetery 
catering to all classes, it does not seem fair to make those who do not want 
these extras pay for them. The trend of the times seems to be away from the 
good old table d'hote to the a la carte method, and perhaps this simile may be 
a bit strange, yet it is well for cemeteries to observe the operation of 
natural economic changes that are going on.</p> 
<p>The charge for flowers, planting, grading, watering annual care and such 
matters are all to be figured on the same basis; namely the charges must meet 
the costs of doing the work and doing it according to the standard previously 
established by the cemetery. There is a certain human tendency to trust that 
soon the time will come when things will right themselves and by keeping along 
and slighting the work that somehow one will get by until that time. But it 
seems a wrong thing to do where annual charges are made that may be revised as 
occasion requires. In the matter of annual care some cemeteries must find 
themselves in a quandary. For instance, in an old cemetery which is now selling 
lots only with Perpetual Care, many of the old lots were sold without Perpetual 
Care. Some of these old lots were under annual care, but many were absolutely 
uncared for. For the general appearance of the cemetery these uncared for lots 
have been fixed up and grass cut, without any payment by the lot owners to the 
cemetery. The annual care received may be small, if the cost is materially 
increased as it should be; some of those who have paid for years will probably 
refuse to continue. Then the cemetery will have so many more lots to care for 
without direct return, or it may give up caring for all lots which do not pay. 
The result will bring a generally unkempt appearance which no amount of care 
lavished on new and Perpetual Care lots can overcome. In a case of this sort 
and probably many have somewhat similar problems, that are peculiar to 
cemeteries, it seems better to continue to keep up the general appearance of 
the cemetery even though the expense has to be charged to new lots or overhead. 
There is another point that constantly comes up in connection with these old 
lots and that is this: the present proprietors of these lots are usually 
numbered in the great middle class; they have not received the immense profits 
that have accrued to the operators in foodstuffs, merchandise and manufacturing 
enterprises not the 200% to 300% increase in wages of many workers. In fact, 
times are pretty hard with them in many old communities and they have much 
difficulty to live and clothe themselves. Whether it is charity to accept $5.00 
where $15.00 should be charged or good business to take $5.00 rather than 
nothing is for each one to decide for himself.</p> 
<p>The increased costs of labor have a very varying effect upon the price of 
new lots, depending upon the amount of labor necessary to bring the reserves or 
newly purchased land into shape for lots. Those who have adopted the excellent 
accounting system, embodies in the paper read at Buffalo by the late A.W. 
Hobart (an able man whose kindly presence and big heart we all miss), will have 
little difficulty in setting down a base price per square feet. Unfortunately, 
some must dig out the cost of the land and estimate the carrying charges, look 
up the cost of drains and avenue construction and compute and estimate the 
grading charges to be applied to the net area available for burial lots. Few 
must include the cost of blasting and excavating rock, but all these things 
must be considered and figured into the new selling price.</p> 
<p>How many know the percent of gross area of a forty-acre tract that will be 
available for sale? More care than some have exercised in the past is necessary 
in accurately compiling all the elements of cost because the amounts involved 
are much greater than formerly; because one must be sure to have his balance on 
the right side of the ledger and because that has generally characterized their 
operation and no charge of profiteering brought against them because of a 
superintendent&rsquo;s easy-going guessing instead of knowing.</p> 
<p>Perpetual Care is the specific performance by the cemetery of a contract 
made by and between it and the lot owner, the consideration being a sum of 
money paid to the cemetery by the lot owner with the proviso that the cemetery 
will use the income forever to care for the graves on the lot and such other 
care as may be stated in the contract. Some Perpetual Care contracts thus limit 
the liability of the cemetery to the amount of work the income will pay for and 
others guarantee to do the specific things enumerated. Though there is a very 
marked difference in the legal aspect of these two forms of Perpetual Care 
contracts, the practical difference in a going cemetery is not so marked, for 
this reason: If a cemetery does not continue to maintain the same general 
appearance of care as formerly, the confidence of the public will be weakened 
and when confidence and trust go, the decline of that cemetery starts.</p> 
<p>The amount of Perpetual Care endowment any lot requires is determined by 
two factors, both variables. First - the cost of doing the work and second - 
the rate of interest that the fund will yield. The yield must be sufficient to 
include the expenses of administering the fund and the actual losses to which 
all large funds are subjected. Of the variation in the cost of doing the work 
every superintendent is aware. The difference in the interest rates on money is 
also apparent to the readers of newspapers, to say nothing of those who are 
carrying overdue mortgages. There appears to be no fixed relation between these 
two variables, because they are each subject to different influences. For 
instance, restricted immigration has been a very strong factor in the wages of 
common labor and its influence on money rates is rather remote. Furthermore, 
the income received from conservative investments and the wage paid labor is 
different in the different localities.</p> 
<p>In 1893 a superintendent states in our proceedings that a fund established 
sixteen years earlier on a basis of a yield of 6% earned in 1892 five percent 
and was likely to earn less in the future. So the question of the proper amount 
necessary to take Perpetual Care is not a new one with this Association. There 
is no rational formula that can be employed. Just as an engineer in designing a 
structure uses the latest data he can secure on the strength of materials, not 
the empirical formula he used five, ten or twenty years ago for similar 
structure, so those entrusted with the designing of Perpetual Care funds should 
consider the stresses and strains which the present times have developed in the 
Perpetual Care structure.</p> 
<p>One old conservative practice in some places was to figure a yield of 3% on 
these funds this at the time the return was from 3&frac34;% to 4% from state 
and municipal bonds. What rate of yield or what conservative figure less than 
the real rate at which bonds may now be purchased shall now be figured. I 
hazard a guess that 4&frac12;% would be a fairly conservative figure on which 
to base the estimate for Perpetual Care. The present yield of liberty bonds is 
better than 5&frac12;% and the yield of municipal bonds twenty years ago was 4%.
</p> 
<p>Suppose it cost $3.00 a year to take Perpetual Care of a lot containing 150 
square feet under pre-war conditions, and $100.00 was the amount required for 
the endowment of the lot. Let us assume that it cost $7.50 to do the same work 
today, then on a 4&frac12;% estimated yield, the endowment should be $166.67 or 
an increase of two-thirds in the endowment. Of course these figures probably do 
not agree with any particular cemetery but the principle seems a reasonable one 
to adopt. It may be said that the rate in twenty years will be back to the old 
figures and it is unsafe to figure 4&frac12;% on a perpetual investment. An 
answer to such statement is that when money rates drop to such figure the costs 
of doing the work will probably likewise drop.</p> 
<p>But what about the lots now under perpetual care which cost perhaps two and 
a half times as much as the income from the endowment fund estimated at 3 
percent? Certainly a going cemetery must fulfill its contracts; the grass must 
be cut and the settled graves raised. In the language of the day it is up 
against a tough proposition. To be sure in the conservative practice of 
estimating assumed, there is probably a return on the original $100.00 
investment of $4.00 instead of $3.00, and if the bonds mature now fixed 
principal of $100.00 may be reinvested to yield $5.50 in absolutely safe 
obligations of the national government. But even under such conditions there is 
a deficit of $2.00 on each $100.00 of the endowment. In some cemeteries, 
probably a good many, more work is done on the perpetual care lots than is 
called for in the contract-for instance, the care of grass alone may be 
specified in the contract for perpetual care and one or more myrtle graves may 
be cared for. This care of myrtle graves may be a matter of annual charge or 
additional endowment.</p> 
<p>But suppose there is no chance for any such relief, then revenue from 
operation must be sufficiently increased to take care of this deficit. To be 
sure when the lots are all sold and only a very small income is obtained from 
operations the income from the perpetual care fund is practically all the fund 
available to care for the cemetery; then there will be no means to raise 
revenue needed to make up a deficit if present conditions then obtain. In case 
of the continued duration of these conditions the only thing to do is to make a 
systematic addition to the endowment fund by devoting a sufficient amount from 
future lot sales to make the endowment fund such amount as will yield enough to 
fulfill the contracts at the time the last lot is sold. These accretions will 
naturally diminish the amount necessary to raise yearly from the operating 
income.</p> 
<p>Here is what Timothy McCarthy said twenty-seven years ago at Minneapolis: 
&quot;In conclusion, gentlemen, our Association must be true to this Gospel of 
Perpetual Care. We know how pleasant and easy it is to receive people's money, 
and how uncertain and difficult it is to carry out the obligations assumed, 
especially in our severe and eccentric climate, but we must keep faith with the 
people, and secure to our citizens at least a burial place, indicating not only 
respect for the dead, but which will also be a source of pride and consolation 
to the living.&quot;</p>

<h2>Communication Between the Office and the Grounds</h2>  Date 
Published:&nbsp;  September, 1919  Original Author:&nbsp;  Matthew P. Brazill  
St. Louis, MO  Original Publication:&nbsp;  AACS Proceedings of the 33rd Annual 
Convention 
<p>On July 14th I received a very nice letter from my old friend, Mr. Salway, 
Chairman of the Convention Committee, requesting me to write a paper for this 
convention, stating at the same time that I had the exceptional privilege of 
selecting my own subject. This was very kind of him.</p> 
<p>If I did not know Mr. Salway for so many years, since 1888, I would have 
taken him for an Irishman; he used so much of what we call the 
&quot;Blarney&quot; in that letter. After some study to find a subject not 
entirely thrashed out, I decided to write something about the shortest and 
quickest method of communication between the office and the officers and men 
through the grounds.</p> 
<p>This subject applies only to large cemeteries having extensive grounds and 
a large number of funerals, where communication is more or less difficult and 
takes much time.</p> 
<p>At our Cemetery, Calvary, St. Louis, we have over 3,000 funerals a year, or 
about an average of ten a day; on some days, especially during the winter and 
early spring months we have over twenty a day. During the Influenza epidemic 
last fall and winter, the average was over thirty a day, with very few men to 
attend to them, as nearly all the labor was requisitioned by the Government for 
the army or in the factories.</p> 
<p>Undertakers in ordering the graves do not always order all the extra work 
they require; they leave this for later consideration, or when they are able to 
have a more detailed understanding with the family, for instance, lining 
graves, erecting tents, etc., which are usually hurried orders, especially if 
the weather is wet or threatening rain. These late orders give considerable 
trouble, as the men must be notified as soon as possible; this condition 
necessitates quick communication with the grounds.</p> 
<p>In our grounds near the center on a hill we have a Bell-tower built of 
brick, sixty-five feet high. The bell is fixed stationary at the apex of the 
tower; it is struck by a large hammer on the outside. This hammer is operated 
by an electric bell-ringing machine, set in motion by an electric battery at 
one of our gates a half mile from the bell-tower. The gate-keeper rings the 
signals by pressing on a button connected with a wire to the bell-tower.</p> 
<p>The signals are expressed by strokes and pauses; for instance, if the 
Superintendent is wanted, one stroke on the bell calls his attention. If the 
Chaplain is wanted, two strokes calls his attention. If the foreman is wanted 
one stroke a short pause followed by two strokes calls his attention and so on 
for officers and men, each has his signal.</p> 
<p>When the Sexton has to locate graves for funerals he calls the foreman on 
the bell who listens for the next signals: the sexton indicates by signals the 
number of men he wants and the different stations at which they are to meet 
him. We have eight stations through the grounds at which the grave-diggers are 
to meet the sexton. For instance, if the sexton has two graves to locate in the 
vicinity of station five; two taps are sounded for the men and five for the 
station. If he wants to locate three graves in the vicinity of station seven, 
three taps are given for the men and seven for the station, etc.</p> 
<p>Connected with these bell signals we have sixteen telephone stations, the 
telephones are locked in a box attached to a post or a tree. Officers have to 
carry duplicate keys for the boxes so as to communicate with the office when 
necessary. These phones are private and not connected with the public phones of 
the city. They are supplied with electric power from the same batteries that 
serve for ringing the bell.</p> 
<p>The signals are repeated at each gate by a repeating tapper, through the 
telephone wires, so that the office can know if any mistake is made by the 
party ringing the bell. There is a regular telephone exchange at the gate where 
the batteries are located and where the bell signals are given.</p> 
<p>When an officer is notified by a bell signal he goes to the nearest 
telephone and gets in communication with the office to find out for what he is 
called; this saves a great deal of time and expedites the work on hand.</p> 
<p>When the foreman calls the roll at seven o'clock in the morning and one 
o'clock in the afternoon, he appoints six grave-diggers to answer the next 
calls for men on the bell. When the first call is sounded No. 1 answers the 
call and No. 2 knows he is the next to be called, so he is listening for that 
call, and so on with No. 3 and 4. We can see from this the great importance of 
the bell signals; they serve as a language to facilitate rapid communication 
between the office and the grounds.</p> 
<p>When the funeral of an adult arrives at the gate it is announced by four 
taps on the bell, followed by the number of the section that the interment is 
to be made in.</p> 
<p>When the funeral of a child arrives, three taps are given, followed by the 
number of the section that the interment is to be made in. This notifies the 
grave diggers of the funeral and section that they are called on to attend.</p> 
<p>One of my motives for selecting this subject was to invite discussion, as 
other large cemeteries have systems of communications, which might be an 
improvement on ours. A repetition of the discussion will prove useful to new 
members, and may have some interest for older members.</p>

<h2>Some Mistakes</h2>  Date Published:&nbsp;  August, 1902  Original 
Author:&nbsp;  W. N. Rudd  Original Publication:&nbsp;  AACS Proceedings of the 
16th Annual Convention 
<p>The sad lessons learned through making serious and expensive blunders are 
generally impressed on one's mind so forcibly as to never be forgotten. While 
the educational value of knowledge so gained is frequently great, the cost is 
excessive.</p> 
<p>It has seemed to the writer that perhaps notes of a few of the many 
blunders which he has made, or of the results of which he has had knowledge 
during some seventeen years of cemetery work, might be of interest and of 
possible value to the younger men in this association.</p> 
<p>Perhaps the greatest, the most inexcusable and the most criminal blunder 
which a cemetery manager can make is in overlooking any possible chance for 
errors or omissions in the records d lots and graves and the data regarding 
interments. No interment should be allowed in any cemetery until a complete and 
perfect system of recording has been provided for and the proper books, indexes 
and plats are in the superintendent's office. The most perfect system possible, 
however, will not secure perfect results without continuous, careful work by 
the superintendent. The plat system is the foundation of all good work in 
cemetery recording, but the results from this system may be sadly lacking in 
accuracy if the lot corners are not permanently marked, if the measurements are 
inaccurate, or the platting is carelessly done. It should be an invariable rule 
that each record shall be made complete while the matter is in hand and not be 
left to a later and more convenient time. It is an equally important rule, that 
as frequently as once each week, every entry relating to lots or interments 
made since the last checking, every distance and measurement and every plat of 
a grave should be carefully checked and verified to the most minute detail. 
Clerical errors occur with the most careful and constant and careful checking 
is the price to be paid for accuracy. In this connection will properly come a 
reference to duplicate records. This is the age of carbon copies. It is a 
matter of slight trouble and expense to duplicate by impression paper the 
consecutive record of interments, and if the copy is kept in a different 
location from the original, the superintendent and his lot owners will have 
abundant cause for thankfulness in case of the accidental destruction of one 
set of records.</p> 
<p>Perhaps the next most important point is the preparation of full and well 
considered plans for the entire cemetery before the first shovel full of dirt 
is handled. Here it pays to make haste slowly and to expend money freely. Every 
dollar carefully expended and many apparently wasted in this way will in later 
years be returned many fold in the saving of expense of development and 
maintenance, besides the added beauty and harmony of all the parts. There are 
too many patchwork quilt cemeteries in the land now. Let us not help to make 
any more of them.</p> 
<p>Just a word upon a tender subject long years of careful work by an 
intelligent man in a cemetery will teach him much; good reading will help 
greatly; attendance at these conventions and visits to the leading cemeteries 
all over the country will do more for him; but he will still be in the primary 
class as compared with the men who make the laying out of cemeteries a 
profession, and have a large number of successful works of this kind to their 
credit. We should let no small feeling of fear or petty jealousy restrain us, 
but when work of this kind is to hand, call for demand, if necessary the advice 
and assistance of the best man who can be had.</p> 
<p>In the new cemetery, lack of funds may prevent good work in the laying out, 
grading and planting of the first sections, a desire to secure lot buyers and 
interments may lead to a laxity in the enforcement of rules and regulations, 
consequently, in nearly all cemeteries, the earlier sections are the most 
unsightly, while as funds accumulate and the cemetery becomes more popular, the 
general work, as well as individual lot improvements are better. The early work 
has been done, and the first sales made near the entrance and every visitor 
forever after is compelled to pass through the most unsightly part of the 
grounds. By all means let us begin at the back instead of the front, or at 
least reserve from sale a large tract around the entrance and extending well 
into the grounds.</p> 
<p>All rules must be general in their application and must be uniformly 
enforced otherwise they are void if contested. A firm and impartial enforcement 
of the rules may save much future trouble. A mistake in point was one where the 
allowing of a lot owner to cut down a small and unimportant tree, came near 
making it impossible to prevent another lot owner from cutting down a two foot 
oak and carting it home for firewood.</p> 
<p>A neglect to keep careful plats of every sewer and water pipe, with all 
levels, connections and junction points; and sizes and. materials of which they 
are constructed, is a mistake no matter how unimportant or temporary the work 
may be.</p> 
<p>Marks for the base lines of all surveys should be made permanent, if 
possible, and bearings taken and recorded, so that they may be replaced if 
destroyed or tampered with.</p> 
<p>The superintendent who has not at his disposal a transit level and rod and 
is not reasonably familiar with their use is to be pitied. It is not a serious 
task for an intelligent man to post himself so as to be able to do all 
necessary surveying and platting for his cemetery and his work will generally 
be much more accurate and satisfactory than that of the ordinary surveyor. Not 
long ago, the writer, in visiting a large cemetery, noticed that a cloth 
tape-line was in use and on asking why they did not use a steel one was told 
that they were too expensive. This reminds one of the old story of the 
carpenter seen walking rapidly down the street with his hands widespread and 
arms extended at full length above his head. Upon being questioned by a friend 
who met him he said, &quot;Don't bother me-got the measure of a door-going to 
make a frame.&quot; Those cloth tape measurements and the carpenter&rsquo;s 
&ldquo;measure of a door&rdquo; are each a little open to suspicion.</p> 
<p>The writer does not claim to have exhausted the subject of mistakes or even 
to have made a beginning on the mistakes he himself has made, but there is one 
that he proposes not to make, which is to read a long paper before this 
association. It will also be noted that he has not quoted any poetry.</p>

<h2>Respect for the Dead and Justice to their Descendants</h2>  Date 
Published:&nbsp;  August, 1902  Original Author:&nbsp;  A.W. Hobert  Original 
Publication:&nbsp;  AACS Proceedings of the 16th Annual Convention 
<p>From time immemorial respect for the dead has been one of the dominant 
virtues of the higher types of civilized people. In the earliest pages of 
history we read the beautiful story of the purchase of the cave of Machpelah by 
the patriarch, Abraham and the dedication thereof as a family burial place, 
where he deposited the loved form of Sarah his long time helpmate and sharer of 
his weal and woe, and where later on his own remains were tenderly laid away by 
his sons; Isaac and Ishmael.</p> 
<p>During recent years this respect has been shown more and more strongly in 
the establishment and maintenance of the modern cemetery, where those dearly 
loved in life may be laid away for their long rest in a quiet, well cared for 
place, where the mourning relatives and friends may visit the graves of their 
departed, feeling safe in the assurance, that come what may, the beauty and 
sanctity of the spot will be preserved for all time.</p> 
<p>Frequently the desire to show respect for the dead leads people to expend 
large sums of money in providing elaborate caskets and other funeral trappings, 
numerous carriages, and expensive floral pieces, and perhaps their feelings are 
relieved by such expenditure; all this is but transitory, the funeral cortege 
comes and goes, the casket is consigned to the grave soon to molder and decay, 
and the flowers fade and are removed from sight. Next a fine monument is 
erected and a marker placed at the grave, and the friends feel that they have 
done all that mortal man could do to perpetuate the memory of and show respect 
for the departed. But in the majority of cases the most important item of all 
has not been considered at all, i.e. the provisions for perpetual care of lot, 
monuments, etc.</p> 
<p>Does the corporation controlling the cemetery in which the burial was made 
provide a fund for this purpose? Or is it controlled by a close corporation, or 
individual owner, whose only aim is to declare large dividends, and when the 
land is all sold abandon the grounds? Private ownership of cemeteries is not 
conducive to the best results as to permanency, and if permitted at all, should 
be under strict laws, and in what better way can our legislators show respect 
and reverence for the dead than by enacting such laws as will require the 
establishment of a permanent care fund in every cemetery.</p> 
<p>In our own city we have two deplorable illustrations of the old style, 
go-as-you-please cemeteries that were run for revenue only until they were 
squeezed dry, since which time they have been abandoned entirely and have 
become the scenes of vandalism which beggar description. Similar cases will be 
found in nearly every city in the country and in many of the smaller towns and 
villages. It is a pleasure to note, however, that the people are awakening to a 
realizing sense of the condition of things and in many places are endeavoring 
to reclaim the abandoned burial plots.</p> 
<p>In respect to the dead, and justice to their descendants, provision should 
be made which will in the future preclude any possibility of a repetition of 
the above mentioned conditions. It should be required of the lot owner that all 
work of a permanent nature placed in a cemetery be constructed in the most 
durable manner possible, and no improvements of a perishable nature permitted. 
Granite and marble monuments and markers set upon solid foundations, and metal 
vases should be about the extent of artificial adornments permitted.</p> 
<p>But the matter of paramount consideration is the permanent care fund. How 
or when this shall be provided is not so important, if it be made certain that 
by the time the land is all sold and the business of the cemetery has ceased to 
be profitable, that then an income will be available, sufficient to keep the 
property in good condition. There are different plans of providing for the 
permanent care fund. One is to set aside a certain percentage of the receipts 
from the sale of lots, another to set aside a certain fixed sum per square foot 
of land sold. Either plan is good and can be readily and comfortably adopted by 
a cemetery well established, with a large income, but in case of a young 
cemetery where the income is yet small, there is a great temptation to put off 
the day when a portion of the income shall be set aside for permanent care and 
to use all the income for other purposes.</p> 
<p>This, no doubt, is mainly the reason why so many cemeteries are still 
without proper provision for the future.</p> 
<p>The writer has a plan in mind which he would like to have discussed, 
namely: to set aside a portion of the ground of the cemetery the proceeds from 
the sale of which constitute a permanent care fund. Suppose, for instance, 
one-fifth of the cemetery in quantity and quality to be set aside, why would 
not this secure the same result as to set aside one fifth of the cash proceeds 
of lot sales? It may be urged as an objection that the management would sell 
the four-fifths and let the remainder go to the last. This could not result in 
damage to the fund, as the last one-fifth would in all probability bring larger 
prices than the portion sold earlier. The beauty of this plan is that it makes 
it easy to do the right thing. Not every cemetery can spare a portion of its 
cash income, but there are none than cannot, even in the beginning dedicate for 
this purpose a portion of its ground. There should be immediate legislation in 
all states, requiring provision to be made for permanent care of all 
cemeteries, old and new, and if the option were given of setting aside ground 
ill stead of money it would meet with little or no opposition. Another 
important advantage of this plan would be in applying it to cemeteries which 
had disposed of a large proportion of' their lands, say two-thirds or three 
fourths. It would be impossible to reach the money received from sold lands, 
but the one-fifth of the land would still be available and could be subjected 
to an arrangement of this kind. .</p> 
<p>In closing I would say that while to our society is due most of the credit 
for the improved condition of cemeteries throughout the country, there still 
remains much to do, and we must continue the work so well begun till we have 
effected still greater reforms.</p>

<h2>From the Undertaker's Point of View</h2>  Date Published:&nbsp;  August, 
1902  Original Author:&nbsp;  H. D. Litchfield  Original Publication:&nbsp;  
AACS Proceedings of the 16th Annual Convention 
<p>I have been asked by one of your committee to say a: few words relative to 
the relationship of undertakers to cemeteries; and being desirous to be plainly 
understood I have committed to writing what has occurred to me, and with your 
kind indulgence will read the same, hoping that in case you do not agree with 
me, that you will take the &quot;will for the deed,&quot; and understand that 
these expressions are the thoughts of one and not of many, among whom so much 
diversity of opinion is likely to exist.</p> 
<p>Gentlemen, I realize the task I have before me, and know that the whole 
thing is a hard problem to solve, but I have given it some thought and hope 
that no one will chide me for speaking my mind.</p> 
<p>Different states have different laws and the same with cemeteries, which 
have different rules and regulations. It is an easy matter for an undertaker to 
enter a cemetery with which he is familiar, but such is not the case when one 
enters a strange cemetery. But before we proceed any further; let's see what 
the law of this Commonwealth is regarding the appointment of undertakers.</p> 
<p>Section 44 of Chapter 78 of the Revised Laws of this Commonwealth says: </p>
<p>&quot;The boards of health of cities and towns shall annually, on or before 
the first day of May, license a suitable number of undertakers who can read and 
write the English language. Such license shall be issued upon such terms and 
conditions as the board of health may prescribe and may be revoked at any time 
by the board if its terms or conditions of any requirements of the law relative 
thereto have been violated by the undertaker. An undertaker who has been so 
licensed may act in any city or town.&quot;</p> 
<p>Now that is the law under which the various boards of health issue to an 
undertaker his license, and he is duty bound to exercise due care, or his 
license will be revoked and the business which possibly he has been years in 
building up, will have to suffer. I am not finding fault with that law, because 
it is also a protection to anyone who conducts his business properly. But how 
is it with the gentlemen who serve in the capacity of Superintendents? They are 
appointed by a cemetery commission and are required to live up to certain rules 
and regulations made by that commission. Therefore, gentlemen, I wish you to 
clearly understand me, that while not complaining of the rigidness of the rules 
by which we are governed, I think that those in charge of cemeteries should use 
a great deal of leniency toward him, with whom he comes in contact so 
frequently, namely the undertaker.</p> 
<p>It is well known that families have peculiar ideas relative to services at 
the grave. I can call to mind a case where a family had a quartette standing on 
the lot singing, while the remains were being removed from the hearse, and 
during the lowering into the grave. The mourners formed a procession which 
moved down the path some distance to the lot, and as the remains passed from 
their sight they returned to the carriages and were driven away, the quartette 
still singing. There have been other cases where the family remained on the lot 
while the grave was being filled, and a quartette singing until the last sod 
was placed on the grave. Many other cases occur to me, one in particular, when 
the family expressed the wish that the casket should be placed upon the bier 
and remain there until the carriages containing the relatives and friends had 
driven by, and the interment left entirely with the undertaker, who was 
expected to see that the same care and tenderness toward the departed was 
exercised as if it was his own. The above facts are mentioned to show that, as 
I first stated, the peculiar ideas of the family notwithstanding those in 
charge of the cemetery, must be respected and their plans carried out and if 
they are not, the undertaker is often censured.</p> 
<p>Now one word in connection with those associated with the cemetery whose 
duty it is to open and close the graves. While it may seem a little hard, still 
I am strongly of the opinion that those men doing that work should be required 
to dress more neatly while in the presence of the mourners, and not as is 
common, appear like the regular laborers of the cemetery. It should be the 
bounden duty of the Superintendent of Interments to attend entirely to the 
lowering of the remains into the grave, and absolutely refuse to allow 
strangers, not accustomed to such work to interfere in so important and solemn 
an undertaking. And let me here state why I have formed this opinion. A case 
occurred to. me where I spoke to the Superintendent as to the manner of 
lowering the remains into the grave, and he feeling that I was exceeding my 
authority was quite indignant and did what he thought proper, and met with a 
serious accident, which virtually reflected upon me and yet I was entirely 
blameless. If pall bearers accompany the remains, as is often the case, their 
duties should cease at once upon arriving at the lot, and the responsibility 
should fall upon experienced and competent men who are familiar with that duty. 
There is a question which arises here and is often asked: Where does the 
undertaker's authority cease? I maintain that his duty is completed the moment 
the remains have been received by the men employed in the cemetery, and I 
contend that he has performed his part, and anything which may occur after that 
devolves upon the cemetery authorities. It is claimed by some superintendents 
that as the funeral procession enters the cemetery, it then becomes their duty 
to take charge of the same, while others feel that they are not responsible 
until the remains are lowered into the grave. I suppose it would be almost 
impossible to fully agree upon all these points, but I have thought that it was 
well to present them for your consideration.</p> 
<p>Another, and what I consider a very important feature, comes to mind, and 
that is in regard to ordering graves for interments. I certainly believe that 
it is the duty of the family and not the undertaker to attend to this. First, 
because oftentimes the representative of the family may not be thoroughly 
familiar with the lot and although having received his instructions where the 
body shall be placed, from the relatives, sometimes makes a mistake, and then 
the undertaker comes in for reproval. Probably many instances can be cited 
where mistakes of this kind have occurred and owners were positive that the 
right directions were given. Telegrams are sometimes sent, saying that the 
interment should be at the right or left, and it is afterwards discovered that 
a mistake has been made which it is then too late to rectify. This has been 
done by reason of those giving the directions, by standing in different 
positions and not at the time giving the matter serious thought, yet having in 
mind that you or I were perfectly familiar with the exact location intended.</p>
<p>One word about brick graves; I believe that the price received for the 
same, varying from $23 to $26 and upwards, ought to cover the entire expense 
without extra charge for the use of the evergreen or boughs. These things are 
for the interest of the cemetery, and certainly would stand to its credit if 
attention were given to it, as the cost is trifling and would undoubtedly be 
appreciated by many families. This to my knowledge is done in some cemeteries 
and not in others. It also comes to me as a suggestion, that if a tent for use 
in stormy weather be provided, for which a nominal, charge could be made, it 
would meet with the approval of the relatives and friends. These are also found 
in some, but not in all cemeteries. All things like these carry with them a 
great deal of weight and certainly attract people to such cemeteries, when they 
wish to purchase a lot.</p> 
<p>And now, gentlemen, comes what I consider a very important matter, and one 
which should be carefully weighed in all its bearings. I say very important 
because it refers to some of the financial matters connected with our vocation. 
It ought to be the duty of the cemetery officials, when an order is given for 
opening a grave or tomb, to request of the party a deposit for the interment 
fee. I never could see why this should devolve upon the undertaker. He does not 
own any part of the cemetery and why should he be called upon to pay, say a fee 
ranging from $5.00 to $30.00 and upward for something in which he is not 
immediately interested, and then be called upon to wait, perhaps a year or more 
before his accounts are settled. When a new lot is sold, payment is demanded 
before an interment can be made yet the interment fee is entirely overlooked, 
and often when the matter is spoken of, the reply will be, &quot;The undertaker 
will make the payment&quot; when he arrives at the cemetery. I claim that when 
the interment fee is demanded of the undertaker, some one is exceeding his 
authority, and doing something which he has no more right to do than an 
undertaker has in attempting to have a bill of his goods charged to the 
cemetery. It may seem somewhat singular, but those familiar with what an 
undertaker has and does go through must realize that they are very often 
imposed upon. Parties will go to the cemetery, order the opening of a grave and 
will be informed that the expense of the same will be met by the undertaker, 
and first he knows of it is when confronted with a bill upon his entrance 
there, while the owners will drive by and go to the station and say nothing to 
anyone leaving the file unpaid, when the entire expense has already been paid, 
except the interment fee which they have stated they would attend to 
themselves. I. trust that the time is not far distant when this manner of doing 
business will be absolutely ignored by the undertakers and that they will 
refuse to meet the demands for these fees without an order from those 
interested, that the same will be paid; and I now reiterate what I have said 
before, that I believe the cemetery officials have no legal right to charge the 
undertaker one single cent, without his knowledge or order. Think this matter 
over carefully, gentlemen and judge for your selves whether I am right or not.
</p> 
<p>I believe that there is one little item that I have overlooked and of which 
I meant to have spoken when I referred to the appearance of the men employed to 
assist at the grave. It is this: There should be a little more care exercised 
in the handling of the straps in lowering the body into the grave, I feel 
assured that none but competent and experienced men should be allowed to handle 
the casket containing the remains. The work is of great importance and should 
anything occur, serious results might come there from.</p> 
<p>Gentlemen, I think I have fairly reviewed our case. I have tried to be 
impartial and confine myself entirely to facts and there is not an instance 
which I have cited but which has come under my personal observation. My remarks 
may have to some seemed rather brusque, but I have only tried to make myself 
plain, as my sole object has been to give you as nearly as possible the 
undertaker's, side of the story while at the same time show you, to some 
extent, how the cemetery officials should, in order to harmonize, make some 
changes in the present mode of doing some of the work. What I have tried to do 
is to give you plain, unvarnished facts, without touching the feelings of 
anyone and I hope I have succeeded in trying to be just as well as generous.</p>
<p>There is always an opportunity for advancement, and it is certainly the aim 
of every business man, while trying to advance his own interests to extend at 
the same time his hand toward his fellow man, with a fraternity of feeling 
which will bind us together. I thank you for your close attention and only 
regret that a better selection has not been made to present the undertaker's 
side of the case. I feel assured that even if the suggestions made by me are 
not all carried out, that they will not be entirely overlooked, and some 
benefit will come from them. For the Association I have none but the kindliest 
feelings and hope that they may succeed in all their undertakings, and realize 
that unanimity of feeling which should prevail with us all.</p>

<h2>What a Modern Cemetery Should be</h2>  Date Published:&nbsp;  September, 
1896  Original Author:&nbsp;  William Stone  Superintendent, Pine Grove 
Cemetery, Lynn, MA  Original Publication:&nbsp;  AACS Proceedings of the 10th 
Annual Convention 
<p>The modern cemetery! What does it mean? It means everything pos&not;sible 
to lighten the grief of those who are called upon to part with some dear one. 
How is this brought about? It is brought about by keeping the grounds neat and 
attractive, clean avenues, well kept lawns and lots, trees and shrubs, in 
variety, flower beds here and there, and a superintendent who is in touch with 
everyone, easy to approach, sympathetic in nature, courteous at all times. Let 
these conditions be brought about, and we have what a modern cemetery should be.
</p> 
<p>When the dead has been laid to rest in its bed of mother earth, and the 
greensward has been replaced, and tender hands have arranged the flowers on 
nature's carpet, and the friends depart, they feel as if the modern cemetery 
had robbed death of half its horrors.</p> 
<p>Compare the graveyards of the past with the cemeteries of today and mark 
the progress. An extract from American Gardening says: The tendency of the 
times is to make the cemetery a park, rather than a marble yard. Ghosts have 
vanished with old fashioned headstones, with skull and cross bones and poetic 
epitaphs.</p> 
<p>Today, our cemeteries are called gardens of the dead, and the work is still 
going on in the direction of beautifying grounds that are now beautiful. And 
for this reason, our Association was formed. Those who have attended our 
conventions have certainly been benefited. Whatever one's occupa&not;tion, he 
will never make a success unless he loves his work. The superinten&not;dent 
should understand the construction of avenues and lawns should know the name 
and nature of trees, shrubs and flowers and not be obliged to ask any man in 
his employ. He can only learn this by practice and study. Books and papers are 
always in his reach, touching upon every subject of interest to him. We read of 
some experiment tried, or some idea advanced, just what we wanted to know, and 
we at once avail ourselves of the courtesy of our un&not;known friend. The 
catalogues issued by leading seeds-men are full of valu&not;able information. 
The mouthpiece of our Association, the PARK AND CEME&not;TERY, has enlightened 
us on many a subject and has done much toward educating the superintendent in 
the better discharge of his duties. It is still in its infancy. Long may it 
live and flourish, and continue to instruct us and those who may follow in our 
work.</p> 
<p>Let me read an extract from Downing's Essays, and see what a master mind 
said nearly fifty years ago. &quot;One of the most remarkable illustrations of 
the popular taste, in this country, is to be found in the rise and progress of 
our rural cemeteries. Twenty years ago, nothing better than a common graveyard, 
filled with high grass and a chance sprinkling of weeds and this&not;tles, was 
to be found in the Union. If there were one or two exceptions like the burial 
ground at New Haven, where a few willow trees broke the mon&not;otony of the 
scene, they existed only to prove the rule more completely. Eighteen years ago, 
in 1831, Mount Auburn, about six miles from Poston, was made a rural cemetery. 
It was then a charming natural site, finely varied in surface, containing about 
80 acres of land, and admirably clothed by groups and masses of native forest 
trees. It was tastefully laid out, monu&not;ments were built, and the whole 
highly embellished. No sooner was atten&not;tion generally roused to the charms 
of this first American cemetery than the idea took the public mind by storm. 
Travelers made pilgrimages to the Athens of New England, solely to see the 
realization of their long cherished dream of a resting place for the dead, at 
once sacred from profanation, dear to the memory, and captivating to the 
imagination.&quot; He then speaks of the leading cemeteries of New York and 
Philadelphia, and says the great attract&not;ion of these cemeteries to the 
mass of the community, is not in the fact that they are burial places or solemn 
places of meditation for the friends of the deceased, or striking exhibitions 
of monumental sculpture, though all these have their influence. The true secret 
of the attraction lies in the natural beauty of the sites and in the tasteful 
and harmonious embellishments of these sites by art. It awakens at once the 
feelings of human sympathy and the love of natural beauty, implanted in every 
heart. He then says in the absence of great public gardens, such as we must 
surely some day have in America, our rural cemeteries are doing a great deal to 
enlarge and educate the popular taste in rural embellishments. They are for the 
most part laid out with admirable taste. They contain the greatest variety of 
trees and shrubs to be found in the country and several of them are kept in a 
manner seldom equaled in private grounds.</p> 
<p>Since these lines were written, rapid strides have been made. Parks have 
sprung up all over our country, and no doubt many a hint was obtained from our 
cemeteries. The lawn mowers were not invented and of course lots did not 
present so smooth an appearance as now. THE MODERN CEMETERY, a few years ago, 
said more monuments are not necessary, but may be admissible under the lawn 
plan. Head and foot stones, however, should be abandoned and not allowed under 
any conditions. They are the multitude of closely huddled stone piles that 
obliterate and destroy the beauty of any landscape, natural or artificial. Only 
by concerted efforts, and by a display of good taste under the guidance of one 
controlling plan, can proper effects be se&not;cured and the cemetery given 
unity in an endless variety, and yet be in harmony with its distinct purpose of 
burial.</p> 
<p>I will add to this by saying that no fence nor structure of any kind should 
be allowed to enclose a lot, or corner post allowed above the grass. I am 
pleased to say that fences are constantly being removed as soon as the consent 
of the owner can be obtained. I understand in some cemeteries, the consent of 
the owner is not asked. In my own case, I get the consent of the owner and in 
some cases, it has been reluctantly given, feeling that it would be regretted; 
but I have found only one case where it was regretted; but on the other hand, 
they have wondered why they did not have it done before. I have taken down four 
this year, and have only twenty-eight more left in the cemetery, and am in 
hopes, inside of three years, that not a fence will be left. There are only ten 
lots enclosed by stone curbings in the ceme&not;tery, and one of those will be 
taken away before long. The graves on our public or free lots are marked by 
numbers on the end of a marble block set level with the grass. No other stones 
are allowed. Thus we are gradually working towards the lawn plan and gradually 
working towards the perpetual care system. Some cemeteries sell under both, 
perpetual care or not. I sell nothing only under perpetual care. Any cemetery 
that sells lots today without the perpetual care system, will at some day 
regret it.</p> 
<p>A carpet of green is the beauty of the cemetery and let us remember that we 
cannot have that unless we start right, and I will not enter into the details 
of making a lawn, because you all know. The kind of grass seed used may vary 
with the locality. But one thing is certain-anything that is worth doing is 
worth doing well.</p> 
<p>How beautiful the trees! Weirs cut-leaf maple with its foliage 
touch&not;ing the grass; the cut-leaf birch with its white branches in lovely 
contrast with the foliage; the purple and other varieties of maples, the purple 
beech, and the giant oak with its outstretched branches that have defied the 
elements for generations. The many varieties of evergreens, and many 
va&not;rieties of our native trees that I will not mention, all contribute to 
make our cemeteries what they are.</p> 
<p>Again, I will quote Downing. He says: &quot;An American may be allowed 
honest pride, in the beauty and profusion of fine forest trees, natives of our 
western hemisphere. North America is the land of oaks, pines and 
magno&not;lias, to say nothing of the lesser genera; and the parks and the 
gardens of all Europe owe their choicest sylvan treasures to our native woods 
and hills.&quot;</p> 
<p>Let us not forget the flowers that do so much to beautify our cemeteries. 
Some have discouraged growing them to such an extent as they are grown in many 
cemeteries. To my mind, their many colors help to bring out the beauty of the 
grass, and make the lawn more beautiful. Who does not love them? They are 
welcome on every occasion, at the scene of festivity and the house of mourning. 
We watch them flourish under the hand of cultiva&not;tion. We see them by the 
wayside, and in the fields, and up among the hills and mountains, cultivated 
only by the hand of nature, and we love them everywhere. They seem to carry 
with them something unexplainable, a sort of Divine inspiration. As I see 
people wending their way to the grave of some dear one, with a bouquet culled 
from among the treasures of the garden, I think what else would answer in the 
place of those flowers, and I answer myself by saying-nothing. They seem to be 
a message to the de&not;parted one, and as far as we know, they may be in some 
way. Let us do all we can to encourage their growth, and not think for a moment 
that they de&not;tract from the beauty of the lawn. I do not advise making a 
flowerbed on the grave, preferring the grass and level at that.</p> 
<p>I have always felt impressed that Sundays should be more generally 
ob&not;served in our cemeteries. I do not see why a superintendent should be 
called upon to sell lots on that day. The plea is made by the people that they 
do not have the time on a week day. The office of the dealer in real estate is 
closed, and this plea is not made to them. Much other cemetery business is put 
off till Sunday by lot owners because they know the cemetery is open for 
business. Why make burials on that day, when the cemetery is full of visitors? 
To see strangers almost mingling with mourners around the grave, is to my mind, 
a scene not in keeping with what should be one of great solemnity. If for no 
other reason, a burial should not be made on Sun&not;day.</p> 
<p>In some cemeteries connected with our large cities, if it is necessary to 
make burials on Sunday, by reason of the large number of bodies brought in, 
means should be taken to prevent a public exhibition.</p> 
<p>In the cemetery that is in my charge, from one to five bodies are brought 
in on Sunday, and they are placed in the receiving tomb, and arrangements are 
then made with whoever of the family that wish to be present at the burial, 
which is generally on Monday and not later than Tuesday. My assistant or 
myself', is present at every burial.</p> 
<p>I have no application to sell lots on Sunday. My office is closed and the 
curtains down. A sign in the window informs visitors that the 
superin&not;tendent and his assistants are prohibited from performing any labor 
on the Sabbath Day, and is signed by the Secretary of the Board of 
Commissioners. An officer is on duty to answer all questions. Observing the 
Sabbath, I think, is as much an improvement to hold up the standard of the 
modern cemetery as the many improvements that have been made in other 
direc&not;tions.</p> 
<p>In conversation with people, and hearing their expressions, I am firmly 
convinced that our cemeteries, in the manner they are kept, do much in the 
direction of education towards a higher standard of thought, and it is 
certainly pleasing, to know that when the inevitable comes, our mortal 
re&not;mains will go back to dust in such beautiful grounds. A common interest 
is centered in our cemeteries. The young and the old walk hand in hand through 
the grounds. We see one standing in silent prayer by the grave of maybe a 
mother, who has fulfilled her mission, leaving a legacy rich with good 
teachings ere she journeyed to that Great Beyond. We look about the cemetery, 
and we see others standing by graves, and in their imagination, they have gone 
to that Great Beyond, and have seen father, mother, brother or sister. Could 
they walk out of the grounds feeling other than better by their visit?</p> 
<p>Let us, therefore, strive to help our Association, and we will, by so 
doing, help ourselves, and see more readily where we can make improvements, 
never forgetting that this is an age of progress, and we must ever be on the 
alert. By so doing, we will make our grounds more attractive, and will be 
rewarded by the appreciation of a generous public.</p>

<h2>Modernization of a Well Established Cemetery</h2>  Date Published:&nbsp;  
October, 1950  Original Author:&nbsp;  Mason Letteau  Executive Vice-President 
Inglewood Park Cemetery, Inglewood, California  Original Publication:&nbsp;  
1950-1951 Cemetery Yearbook 
<p>It has been my good fortune the past five years to have had the opportunity 
of assisting in the almost complete overhauling and modernization of a large 
and well established cemetery. Inglewood Park was founded in 1905 by a small 
group of businessmen, including my father, George Letteau, who was president 
until his death last year. The only surviving member of this group of founders 
is our present president, Charles B. Hopper, who for fifty years has been 
acclaimed as one of the outstanding real estate men and developers in the 
Southern Cali&not;fornia area. My experience working with Mr. Hopper during 
recent months in modernizing and improving Inglewood Park Cemetery has been the 
most valuable training of my life.</p> 
<p>Inglewood Park comprises three hundred acres and now is very centrally 
located, surrounded with heavy population, and bounded by major highway 
arteries; yet in 1905 it was considered incredibly far out in the country, with 
a horse-drawn street car being its only saving feature. In those days the 
street car company built a special flat car that was used to transport the 
casket, and many times the entire funeral procession would proceed from the 
funeral parlor to the cemetery by street car. During the first year we had 
thirty-two interments, but forty-five years has wrought a great change and now 
we handle between five and six thousand interments each year. On certain days 
we have had as many as sixty-five interments in the park. To date there have 
been in the neigh&not;borhood of one hundred forty-five thousand interments, 
and our endowment care trust fund is now slightly over two million four hundred 
thousand dollars. We wish that the fund was much larger and hope in a few years 
there will be many mote millions of dollars in it, but even so it has increased 
quite a bit during the last forty-five years.</p> 
<p>For the first twenty-five years of its growth, Inglewood Park underwent 
many changes and was constantly being developed and improved. In 1910 the first 
community mausoleum in the state of California was constructed there. This 
building, comprising twenty-five hundred crypts, has, of course, been sold out 
for many years, and our newer Mausoleum of the Golden West now contains twelve 
thousand crypts and is planned to eventually comprise at least fifty thousand 
crypts. I doubt whether I will be alive when we have fifty thousand crypts 
there, but we have ample room and fully drawn plans for that size.</p> 
<p>Nevertheless, despite this early growth and development, there was little 
done in the way of modernization from 1930 to 1945. The cemetery looked exactly 
the same throughout this period, only each year all of the buildings were 
getting older, and our facilities becoming more and more outmoded. Practices 
were followed and rules enforced, not because they were the best, but just 
because we had always had them and followed them in the past. It was obvious to 
all of us that even though the company was prosperous and well regarded this 
policy of doing almost nothing new would have to be terminated and the 
ceme&not;tery given a thorough overhauling. This job has, in large part, been 
allotted to me, and it has been a great privilege as well as a fascinating and 
invaluable experience. We have made mistakes, some of them costly, but we feel 
proud of what has been accomplished in so short a time. We know there is much 
more to do, and our Board of Directors is determined to continually push this 
modern&not;ization program until our goal has been accomplished.</p> 
<p>During the past few months we have prepared a series of colored slides 
which illustrate far better than mere words the progress we have made in this 
program. My assistant, George Thomsen, who has taken most of these pictures 
that you are going to see, will now project them for you and I will add a few 
informative comments.</p> 
<p>(Showing slides) The first view shows our remodeled entrance, which was one 
of the first changes we made. We feel it particularly vital to have our main 
entrance both attractive and easily noticed. Originally, we had a wrought iron 
sign but eventually it became darkened and very difficult to read. A few years 
ago two beautiful fountains were donated to the cemetery by the widow of one of 
the original founders and these were constructed on either side of the 
entrance. About three years ago we replaced the wrought iron sign with a large 
electric sign that is easily readable day and night. Recently we have operated 
our fountains at night as well as in the daytime and have installed colored 
lights to focus upon the streams of water. Thus we feel we have transformed a 
dark space along the highway into almost a fairyland scene through the evening 
hours. During the year we constantly strive to see that our flower beds around 
our entrance are as beautiful and imposing as possible. It has been a great 
satisfaction to receive appreciative comments about them from visitors, for we 
then feel that our goal of creating a favorable first impression is being 
achieved. These beds can be easily viewed by all traffic passing by, even 
though many of the cars may not enter the cemetery, and therefore we feel they 
act as a very helpful advertisement. Each Christmas we place a large decorated 
and lighted Christmas tree in the very center of our entrance and this has 
created so much public interest that many people in the neighborhood have come 
especially to see it and the local papers have often contained pictures of it.
</p> 
<p>Until this March we operated a downtown business office. The next series of 
pictures will show how, for a very moderate cost, we have transformed our 
superintendent's former office and home in the park into a complete and modern 
administration building. This step of centralizing all departments under one 
building within the cemetery grounds has, without a doubt, been one of the most 
beneficial that we have taken. It has reduced our costs and enabled us to serve 
both the general public and the funeral directors utilizing Inglewood Park in a 
more efficient and satisfactory manner. In our new administration building we 
have constructed two modern consultation rooms which we feel help us in our 
sales very, very much. These rooms are large enough so that an entire family of 
eight or ten can comfortably be seated in them. We have furnished them in the 
manner of a sitting room or lounge rather than an office and have tried with 
our furniture and decorations to make them as pleasant and relaxing for the 
families using them as possible. They are bright arid cheerful and 
con&not;stantly have fresh flowers on the tables. There is nothing in either 
room in the way of urns, miniature vaults, or anything that would tend to 
depress the families while they are sitting in them. Our only mistake was in 
not constructing more and I am sure that we will have to remedy this in the 
near future.</p> 
<p>At the present time we are in the process of remodeling Grace Chapel, which 
was originally constructed in 1918. This chapel seats up to two hundred and 
fifty people and is a replica of an old and well known building in England. 
Unfortunately, there are many steps leading up to the main floor of the chapel, 
which has constantly provided difficulties for older people and made it 
extremely, unpleasant to bring in large and heavy caskets. At the present time 
we are completely remodeling Grace Chapel and are considering lowering the main 
floor to ground level. We are adding much needed features, such as a minister's 
room and a flower receiving room. Ultimately we hope to have Grace Chapel 
contain all modern features and improvements but still look exactly the same 
from the outside, for its exterior appearance has come to be regarded with much 
sentiment and attachment by our lot owners.</p> 
<p>A little over a year ago we constructed a new and much smaller chapel which 
we have designated as the Chapel of the Chimes. One of the features we have 
found to be most appreciated in it is a family garden where the immediate 
members of the family may gather and visit together before and after the 
service in privacy and seclusion. We have no curtains or drapes in the Chapel 
of the Chimes and allow bright sunlight to come in at all times. The fact that 
it is bright and cheerful and decorated in beautiful pastel shades of green and 
pink has been very well received by those using it. We have endeavored in every 
way possible to avoid having anything dark or gloomy in the entire building.</p>
<p>The following series of slides illustrate our new Crematorium, which we 
believe to be the finest that has ever been constructed. The retort room itself 
has green terrazzo floors and aluminum painted concrete walls. We try to keep 
this room at all times as clean and immaculate as an engine room in a 
battleship or an operating room in a hospital. The general public may visit the 
retort room at any time, and every day many visitors pass through it even while 
all four retorts are operating. We feel that we are helping to sell cremation 
by allowing the general public to thoroughly understand what cremation is all 
about and to see how clean and sanitary the entire process is in our 
Crematorium. Some people like it and some do not, but in any event we feel that 
we have taken all of the mystery and unpleasantness out of it. One interesting 
feature about our retorts is that they have two methods of operation-natural 
gas or fuel oil. We felt that there might be times during a war or in a severe 
winter when natural gas would not be available and therefore we constructed a 
stand-by method of operation. Normally, we use natural gas, even though it is 
slightly more expensive, because of the fact that it is much cleaner. However, 
in the matter of a few seconds, any retort can be converted to fuel oil.</p> 
<p>The only views which I am going to show of our Mausoleum of the Golden West 
are of a new feature which I feel is one of our greatest improvements. It is a 
new type of display crypt with a plate glass front, concealed fluorescent 
lights and modern appearing drapes inside of the plate glass. The crypt itself 
is painted a pastel shade and carpeted in a contrasting color. Our original 
display crypts were just like those that are now to be seen in most mausoleums 
through&not;out the country. They were dark and foreboding in appearance and 
people could reach inside and touch the cold and often unpainted concrete with 
their hands. We have endeavored to make our new display crypt look just as 
bright and attractive as possible, and the effect on the public has been truly 
astonishing. It has not only assisted us in selling crypts in all parts of the 
building, but, strangely enough, has created a great demand for crypts adjacent 
to it and directly facing it. People seem to want to own crypts close by 
because of the fact that it is bright and colorful and lighted at all times.</p>
<p>Our most recent step in modernization has been to construct a completely 
new corporation yard consisting of a large machine shop, warehouse, paint shop, 
and a complete concrete vault and sectional box plant outside of the cemetery 
proper. It is directly across the street from one corner of our park and on 
some property that could never be zoned for cemetery use. This move has served 
a dual purpose of giving us several acres of land already dedicated for 
interments to sell in one of the older and completely sold out sections of the 
park, and at the same time removed what we have always felt to be a major 
eyesore.</p> 
<p>In recent years we have tried in every way possible to bring color into the 
cemetery. We feel there is far too much green and we have attempted to add 
color to it in the way of flower beds, flowering trees and water lilies. One of 
our most beautiful trees, which is shown in the concluding slides, is the 
flowering Eucalyptus. They bloom for several months and I wish we had many more 
of them in the cemetery. They come in several different intense and vivid 
shades of red and orange.</p> 
<p>I want to thank you all very much for your courtesy and attention. It has 
been a great pleasure for me to come to Milwaukee and have a small part in this 
fine convention. I appreciate your allowing me to appear on the, program the 
first time I have attended an NCA meeting, Thank you very much!</p>

<h2>Important Management Considerations</h2>  Date Published:&nbsp;  October, 
1950  Original Author:&nbsp;  J.Howard Wendorph  Vice-President, White Chapel

Cemetery Yearbook 
<p>It has been said there is no royal road to Geometry. If one begins at the 
bottom of the ladder in the cemetery business he will soon realize there is no 
royal road to cemetery management either. There are many problems and pitfalls 
that line the pathway leading to the title of a cemetery manager.</p> 
<p>By overcoming them, one will certainly become much wiser, more capable, and 
will have a greater understanding of his business. To avoid and ignore our 
problems and to seek the easy out shows a weakness of will power. I have always 
tried to form a habit of choosing a form of action that I believe will be the 
best in the long run, in place of one that seems to be the easiest at the 
moment.</p> 
<p>I have endeavored, in the time allotted, to use the same line of reasoning 
in presenting my subject, &quot;Important Cemetery Management 
Considerations.&quot;</p> 
<p>Let us begin by considering first, one of the most important considerations 
of management-the manager, the person wherein lies the success or failure of 
cemetery operation! What are the qualifications of a cemetery manager? What 
should he possess within himself that fits him to be a cemetery manager?</p> 
<p>In my opinion the most important qualification is his personality. I would 
apply this yardstick in personnel from the laboring man up to the office man. I 
believe there could be nothing more kindly said of your cemetery than to have 
it referred as a cemetery with a personality, and that personality will 
certainly reflect the type of man at the top, and through him infiltrate 
through the entire organization.</p> 
<p>The term &quot;a cemetery with a personality&quot; may not mean too much to 
you at first thought, but to put this idea into practice, you must have a smile 
as you serve, you must make people feel welcome and comfortable you must make 
them feel they are of great importance. The manager sets the pattern for others 
to observe and follow. He must be a person with vision, constantly thinking 
ahead, seeking new ideas, never being satisfied with previous accomplishments 
and above all humble enough to take advice and apply it wisely.</p> 
<p>The manager should be capable of understanding human nature, be 
sympa&not;thetic, and his code should be one of honesty, integrity and loyalty. 
Proper personality is one of our best insurance policies for successful 
management. Now let us assume that we have found the ideal manager. Let us 
bring to his attention some of the more important management considerations. 
There are many, of course, but I want at this time to present some that are 
vital and require his immediate consideration.</p> 
<p>In doing so I would like to have you bear with me as I look in retrospect 
upon the cemetery business as I remember it a great many years ago. The 
cemetery business in those days was not as aggressive or involved as it is 
today. Compe&not;tition, if any, was of little consequence, but service 
rendered was extensive, although rather crude, and funerals were an event. 
Morticians, or undertakers, as they were called, were friendly and most 
cooperative. Monument dealers and stone cutters, now known as memorial 
craftsmen, were reluctant to enter into the cemetery business and did not dream 
of the bronze marker industry.</p> 
<p>In those days the funeral procession consisted of horse drawn vehicles, 
some of which were owned and operated, believe it or not, by the cemeteries. 
The servicing of the funeral was a full day's work. The most important thought 
was to be buried in style and with plenty of show, and most certainly to have a 
well attended procession to the cemetery.</p> 
<p>It necessarily required a large staff of employees to service a funeral. 
There was a coachman, uniformed pallbearers, and in the absence of electrically 
operated chimes, you had to have a bell toll as the funeral procession passed 
by. Yes, funerals were truly an event, but how different today. In many 
cemeteries in the larger cities, funerals get to be on a production basis, and 
yet they receive so much better service than in the old days, with greater 
efficiency and less personnel. The days of the long funeral processions are 
gradually coming to an end. Year after year, yes, even from day to day, we see 
the funeral procession becoming shorter, and in a great many cases it is 
entirely eliminated.</p> 
<p>Now it is an accepted fact that all cemeteries build toward sales through 
the many people who visit their cemetery by way of the funeral procession. It 
has been a great medium of advertising. If the property was attractive, had 
appeal, was well managed and well maintained, as well as being well serviced, 
people were interested, but today there is a definite trend toward eliminating 
this oppor&not;tunity of using the funeral procession to make friends and 
ultimate sales. We are at this time in a fast moving age, an age in which 
people cannot conveniently find sufficient time to bury their dead reverently, 
and they are encouraged in this practice by the introduction of a new idea 
presented to those confronted with the burial of their loved ones-the idea of 
eliminating the funeral procession.</p> 
<p>Obviously it entails less work for the funeral director; it eliminates his 
work at the cemetery in inclement weather and provides more hours for his 
recreation. There is, however, one important fact in his favor of ending the 
entire service at the funeral parlor, and that is the increasing hazard of 
traffic conditions, most certainly in the larger cities, where so many 
accidents occur in funeral processions.</p> 
<p>Let us become realistic. Let us wake up to the fact and recognize this 
increasing trend of having the committal service at the funeral parlor; let us 
recognize this as causing a definite loss in sales, contrasted with the funeral 
procession to our property in the past. Just how serious is this situation at 
the present time? Last year at a great many properties, over fifty percent of 
the cremation services were funerals without a procession, and much worse, 
without any of the family attending. Why should an individual who desires his 
body cremated be denied the full conventional funeral ritual? In a family of 
husband and wife who have opposite ideas of the method of disposing of their 
bodies, one can desire either interment or entombment whereby the friends 
accompany the body to the ceme&not;tery; the other might desire cremation where 
the committal ritual takes place at the funeral parlor. Why, may I ask the full 
respect for one and the lack of ceremony for the other? I can see no reason for 
such discrimination.</p> 
<p>I can well understand how easy it is to promote the idea in cremation 
cases, and I can cite many of the arguments being used, but dangerously as the 
record indicates, the practice is rapidly finding its way into the entombment 
services, and it is obvious that it is just a matter of time until the funeral 
procession will be entirely eliminated.</p> 
<p>I want to give you a concrete example of an experience we encountered just 
two weeks ago. A lady came to our property, expressed her desire to look at 
some columbarium space and intimated to the superintendent that it was for 
future use, and he, after showing her throughout the mausoleum and pointing out 
to her the various features, commented about the various chapels and she wanted 
to know what they were used for, and he told her they were used for the 
committal service for cremation or mausoleum entombment, or interment. She then 
revealed there would be a cremation service in her family on Tuesday. This was 
Sunday that she visited us. She said, &ldquo;We will not be coming out here to 
your chapel because the funeral director told us they weren't going to the 
chapels any more at the cemetery, they were concluding the service at the 
funeral direc&not;tor&rsquo;s parlor.&quot; However, she thought it would be 
very nice to have the committal service at one of our chapels, so we waited 
anxiously for the order to come through expecting they would have a committal 
service in our chapel, but the funeral director was more powerful than our 
management, and the body came out unattended even by the widow.</p> 
<p>How shall we combat this practice, or shall we even try? It is my opinion 
that the practice is too far advanced to do so and move over, we are not 
organized properly to cope with it. We might more wisely spend our time and 
energy filling the sales gap with other activities and methods, perhaps through 
beautifying grounds and buildings, training courteous personnel, in an active 
public rela&not;tions program, and in a well planned aggressive sales campaign. 
In short, we must carry our story to the people in their homes, if we expect to 
merchandise our property.</p> 
<p>Another challenge which has been presented to the cemeteries by the people 
in the memorial craftsmen group who have advertised in our local papers 
advertising for the public to consult not us, but memorial craftsmen, before 
purchasing their cemetery lots. This advertising is directed to everyone 
con&not;templating a purchase in the monument or non-monument cemetery. Clearly 
they seek to govern the choice of purchase, as well as the amount of money to 
be expended for the memorial estate.</p> 
<p>Now all this leads to the subject assigned me, &quot;Important Management 
Considerations,&rdquo; for unless we rise up to meet these challenges, 
eventually we win have nothing to manage and consider. It will all be managed 
for us. Not long ago I talked with a cemetery operator. He said he was not 
interested in the internal activities of his property. He did not have the time 
or energy to promote them. He was interested in the sale of space only, which 
to me labeled him as being nothing more nor less than a real estate operator. 
How can a man claim to be a cemetery operator if he does not think beyond the 
sale of space? It is true that we all cry for the need of sales, but it is my 
belief that it would be better to cry for the need of families.</p> 
<p>It is most important for a successful operator to think in terms of 
families rather than the monetary value of each individual sale. A volume of 
families, even though the sales be small is wheat in the bin. They produce an 
abundance of future operating revenue which is the lifeblood of our existence. 
Strive as you may to build your fund, you will find it difficult to accomplish 
if, out of necessity, you are using funds acquired for the sale of land to meet 
your payroll, but with the ever increasing revenue accumulated from the many 
services rendered on those productive sales which include interment and marker 
charges, winter covering, floral services and other miscellaneous items to meet 
present and future expenses, it is evident you will acquire your 
&quot;care&quot; fund with greater facility.</p> 
<p>To do this we need families, small sales, revenue producing sales. We 
should not be overly concerned with large sales, for in such cases there will 
be unused graves that are non-productive. It is very pleasing to us if we, in 
reviewing our sales report, find a salesman who has produced $4,000 worth of 
business in one month, but we should be more interested in breaking down this 
report and analyz&not;ing it for the potential operating revenue. If the 
salesman, in providing this $4,000 in sales, sold eight six-grave lots at $500 
each, we have a minimum of potential operating revenue. On the other hand, if 
he had sold sixteen three-grave lots at $250 each, we have definitely sixteen 
good revenue producing accounts.</p> 
<p>It is reasonable to assume that most of these graves will be used, and if 
you add to that the profit from the miscellaneous revenue on each interment, 
you are ahead on the sale of interment space. In addition to this, let us not 
lose sight of the radiation of two families instead of one. You are doubling 
your sales force. Surely satisfied owners are good for many additional sales. 
So my advice to you as cemetery operators is to operate with one more important 
thought in mind and ask yourselves this question: How many families can we 
permanently associate with our cemetery this month, for if you get a volume of 
families, the dollar volume will take care of itself. They will be dollars not 
just for today, but for many years to come, and then you will always have the 
needs for proper management.</p> 
<p>I am not going to suggest the methods used in making the family ties. That 
is the business of the salesmen and the sales manager. My problem and your 
problem as operators is to see to it that there is operating income after the 
sales department has sold us out of our capital assets. Our own capital assets 
are the property we have to sell, with interment or entombment or columbarium 
space. Any additional income must be created, and no outsider is going to 
create it for you.</p> 
<p>A short time ago a funeral director friend was telling me of a recent 
funeral he serviced. His remarks were something like this: &quot;Brother, did I 
have a good job the other day; sold a copper and a good vault.&quot; I asked 
him how his&not; service went, were there many people in attendance, and did 
everything work out smoothly, but it appeared this was incidental to him, as 
the only part of the service he apparently was concerned with was the sale of 
the casket and the vault. I attempted to point out that he should be more 
concerned with his service to the family by having a well conducted funeral 
which would lead to additional calls through radiation, rather than the sale of 
merchandise only, but he wasn't interested in that fact, but only that his 
profit was large on the sale of his merchandise. After all, that paid his rent 
and allowed him to put some money in the bank. This is nothing more or less 
than living by a policy of making it today and letting tomorrow take care of 
itself.<br>
 How many in our business work at management as does this funeral 
director? Are you going to value the opportunity to advertise and merchandise 
those revenue producing items which come by thinking and operating beyond the 
initial sale of the property?</p> 
<p>I want to touch on one more point that has been much debated in cemetery 
circles, and I assume that many of you are not in perfect accord with the 
methods of merchandising cemetery property, most certainly on a 
pre-construction basis, so let us compare pre-construction sales with other 
commodities. We will find it is no different than any of them providing you 
have established yourselves as a going institution, one that has gained the 
respect and confidence of the people of your community.</p> 
<p>Most of us have driven cars we ordered from a reliable manufacturer through 
a salesman's story or descriptive literature. There wasn't the least doubt in 
our minds that the car when delivered would be well constructed and all that 
was claimed for it. Usually we were more pleased when we saw the actual car 
than with the pictures, yet the pictures induced us to make our selection and 
sign the order.</p> 
<p>All of us buy before need and before the commodity is produced and think 
little of it, but when it comes to selling burial lots, many operators feel it 
is unethical and misleading to the purchaser and unsound for the cemetery. All 
of us who have had experience with sales are convinced in so many of these 
cases they turn out to be most unhappy and dissatisfied owners. Why? Because, 
first, the sales person does not have the time to spend with these families to 
properly sell them on the institution. They do not thoroughly understand the 
values and the many features of the property. It is logical to assume that 
at&bull; that particular' time the purchaser would remember but one-tenth of 
what he was told.</p> 
<p>In the pre-construction campaign, all of these advantages are clearly 
portrayed in the home by visual as well as a descriptive trip through the 
property by well trained consultants. Prior to and during the construction of 
the property, you will find their anticipation of seeing completed property 
prompts them to watch the progress as it is developed, and talk of it to their 
friends and neighbors. Compare this to the purchase of developed property 
whereby the purchaser pays the account, places the deed in a strong box, never 
to think about it again until the property must be used.</p> 
<p>Yes, the pre-construction sales are very advantageous to you for radiation 
purposes, provided you do not overload your families by selling them more than 
they actually need for protection. However, you must first get yourselves out 
of the old graveyard category. You must manage your property in a manner worthy 
of recognition by the people of your community, as being a great asset to them 
in beauty, friendliness, personality and service.</p> 
<p>Join with them in whatever community memorial activities are being 
promoted. Make them feel proud they have a modern cemetery institution in their 
community.</p> 
<p>These operations can all be classified, then, I believe, under the heading, 
&quot;Important Cemetery Management Considerations.&quot; I would like to point 
out first the need of important qualifications for a cemetery manager, and 
second, there are definite changes in funeral practice which have created a 
sales gap resulting in a loss of potential sales and loss of interest in 
property. Therefore, the problem resolves itself into this: Cemetery management 
must create policies to capture public interest, to acquire a volume of 
friends, to increase miscellaneous operating revenue by such methods as proper 
advertising, intelligent public relations program, and effective sales 
campaign. Remember, your only capital assets are the properties that you have 
to sell, interment, entombment and columbarium space, and I forcibly repeat 
that all other revenues are created entirely by your own acts.</p> 
<p>Make your business live-make it one of action and of result; even as our 
worth is determined by the good deeds we do rather than by the fine emotions we 
feel, so the growth and success of our cemetery industry depends upon the 
accomplishment of well-manned, constructive and progressive activity.</p> 
<p>Only action gives to life its strength as only moderation gives to it 
charm. Action may not always bring success, but I assure you there is no 
success without action. Thank you!</p>

<h2>Guides for Cemetery Management</h2>  Date Published:&nbsp;  October, 1950  
Original Author:&nbsp;  John T. Bailey  President, Mount Olivet Cemetery, Fort 
Worth, Texas  Original Publication:&nbsp;  1950-1951 Cemetery Yearbook 
<p>I made a trip in April to California, and met the gentleman who preceded me 
there, Mr. John Gregg. I, for one, am not going to be fool enough to take him 
up on his wager. He is unquestionably one of the biggest men I have ever met. 
He is so big in every respect that I consider it a great honor to have met Mr. 
Gregg and to have shaken his hand, and when you make your trip to the sales 
conference, if you really want to see something, go down to Whittier, 
California.</p> 
<p>He purchased one hundred thousand dollars worth of tractors just to move a 
mountain to make a section for his cemetery. That is just the kind of way that 
guy operates. So, John, even if you are enthused, please have a little mercy on 
the rest of us.</p> 
<p>That is not part of my talk. I have prepared a good deal of material to 
talk on, but those who have preceded me have already covered most of my 
subjects, so I will only attempt to give parts of it. We find, as cemetery 
operators, that we can do about anything we want to. It certainly has been 
proven to us by those who have appeared on this platform already what could be 
done. I find my hardest problem is to ascertain just what I want to accomplish, 
and that is the reason I have always come to these meetings. That is the reason 
I have traveled to see what other people have done and are doing, so that I 
might help myself ascertain just what I want done.</p> 
<p>Once we know what we want, what we really want, we can clear the deck, and 
go right ahead and do it, but we must ascertain a great many facts before we 
can proceed. I am sure that many of you are kind of like us in Texas that your 
greatest competition is the country graveyard. That is true in our part of the 
state, so our most important objective is to make our properties so perfect and 
so beautiful, to make them appear to be magnificent repositories for the 
earthly remains of the people of the community so that the people may ascertain 
the difference between the country graveyard and the modern burial ground.</p> 
<p>The most important man for me in my cemetery is a man who knows how to 
handle the workmen and the people in the office, and how to buy machinery and 
equipment, because he is the man who will make this cemetery beautiful. He will 
either squander money or he will save money. The ability to handle men is 
considered the most important quality that a man can have in the Army. In the 
Army they call it leadership. That is the most important qualification of a man 
in charge of a cemetery, in my opinion. It is absolutely imperative that he be 
mechanically inclined, in my opinion, and of course that he have ambition.</p> 
<p>We found that we have been able to clean up our cemetery by simply adopting 
the little motto: &quot;Fix it so you can mow it&quot;; we had to spend a 
little extra money rearranging things, taking out some things so that a 
lawnmower may be rolled across an area and so that we do not have to trim so 
much.</p> 
<p>Now as we go into the office, we find that in some cemeteries the big 
trouble is collections. You certainly cannot have a successful sales department 
unless you have a collection department to help it. The purchaser may make the 
down payment to the salesman, but that first monthly payment must be made, as 
well as the balance of them. The thing to do is set up a collection department. 
Let that be the primary number one job of at least one person in your office.
</p> 
<p>We found if, by making it the number one job, and the job of being 
secretary, of writing letters of condolence, etc., be secondary to the number 
one job of the collection department, that it is a great help to us in cutting 
down percent&not;ages of cancellations caused generally by weak salesmen. A 
weak salesman will turn in a lot of sales that the first payment will not be 
made on, unless you have an intelligent man or woman in charge of your 
collection department. An intelligent man or woman operating your collection 
department will make it easier for you to keep your salesmen.</p> 
<p>In selecting personnel in your cemetery it is better to get younger men, in 
my opinion, and let them fight their way up. If you get an older man who is 
ex&not;perienced, you may be disappointed. I have been disappointed. I found 
that it is better for me to get young men and to train them and let them fight 
their way up. Every time I hire an expert I get a disappointment, except, of 
course, when I hired Chester Sparks, but to put a man up on a pedestal and 
expect a lot of things of him, you might be disappointed. To let a man fight 
his way up, you are helping that man. To put a man up on a pedestal and expect 
more of him than he is able to produce, able to do, you are going to hurt him 
as well as yourself.</p> 
<p>Remember the expression, &quot;enthusiasm.&quot; We have certainly received 
a full dose of it today.</p> 
<p>Recently, I had the occasion to visit with an old Army friend of mine who 
was my boss. He is in the Pentagon Building and I have always admired him 
because of his ability to maintain a smooth running organization. He told me 
this: &quot;Show me a man with enthusiasm and I will show you a man that has 
original ideas.&quot; The Army today is just like every one of us in business. 
They are searching for leadership and for enthusiasm and for original ideas. 
When you find men and women that have enthusiasm and original ideas, cling to 
them with all your heart and soul, because they are very scarce.</p> 
<p>The previous speakers have allowed me to eliminate a good portion of my 
talk, and I will cover only one or two more points. One is that once you have 
ascertained what you want, you much emulate, if possible, that great American, 
Judge Harold Medina, who presided over the nine month trial of the 
Com&not;munists a few months ago. He's been eulogized in many articles in 
various ways because of the manner in which he conducted this trial. He has 
accom&not;plished many other achievements during his lifetime. Upon being asked 
how he was able to do it, his reply was, &quot;You must have method and 
persistence over the long pull.&quot; Once we know what we want, once we have 
ascertained exactly, unequivocally what we want, we can find it. It is simply a 
matter of method and persistence over the long pull.</p> 
<p>The difficulty we sometimes have with men is that they know what they want 
today, but a week later they have forgotten about it. Let us remember the words 
of Harold Medina and not attempt to do it all in one day, but to lay a plan and 
each morning as we get up, make a new resolve to ourselves as to what our 
objectives are. That is the only way on earth we will ever get what we want.</p>
<p>There is only one other point I want to bring out, and that is, we in the 
cemetery business are showmen. We must be good showmen. We must make our 
cemeteries sacred in their appearance in every respect as they certainly should 
be. The conduct of the personnel in our office must be the conduct of good 
showmen. Our own personal conduct must be the conduct of good showmen. If, when 
we enter our offices, we see the stage we would like to see, fine. Don't do 
anything about it, but if your office, your cemetery grounds, or the people who 
represent you to the public are in your opinion poor showmen, you can never 
develop what you really want.</p> 
<p>We find that by a little showmanship, we can really improve everything, 
including the attitude of the public and the funeral directors, or whoever we 
might want, towards our institution. The funeral director opens his door, bows, 
and smiles and gives the attitude that he takes the utmost care. If we will 
just use the funeral director as a guide on what to do in good showmanship, we 
will find that we can get a great deal more for our property, and thereby we 
will be able to spend more money on it and make it the sacred place in 
appearance of our community that it actually is. I thank you!</p>

<h2>All of my Committal Services are in the Chapel</h2>  Date Published:&nbsp; 
 October, 1950  Original Author:&nbsp;  Kenneth Anderson  Sales Manager, 
Clinton Memorial Park, Clinton, Iowa  Original Publication:&nbsp;  1950-1951 
Cemetery Yearbook 
<p>Some time ago a gentleman passed away in our locality. At the time, his 
widow was in the hospital. Since she was unable to attend the service, we held 
the body until she could view the remains of her deceased husband.</p> 
<p>The body was held in our rock receiving vault, called &quot;Ivy Rest,&quot; 
which is a little 20 x 20 rock building, well ventilated and insulated, having 
pipe racks of three tiers on two sides of the building. To make it homelike, 
beautiful drapes were hung and the floor was covered with a mat of artificial 
grass. A soft light from a floor lamp illuminated the building.</p> 
<p>For the funeral, we placed a tent against this receiving vault. The 
pallbearers placed the casket in the receiving vault and flowers were banked 
outside. About a month later, the widow viewed the body and ordered the 
committal. The family was so impressed that we asked others to hold their 
committal services in this manner, and it was accepted by a few.</p> 
<p>This particular committal took me back to the early days of my childhood 
when one of my grandparents was laid away in an old cemetery. I remember the 
pile of clay and the rough open grave, with the casket resting upon two planks 
set across the opening. I also remember the pallbearers coming forth, gently 
lowering the casket into the grave.</p> 
<p>The thought came to me that even with our modern equipment, spacious tent 
and automatic lowering device of the present day, some child might carry 
through life this same picture. It appeared to be an unnecessary grief brought 
upon the family.</p> 
<p>The officers of our company, and I, thought it would be a relief to the 
family if the committal services were held away from the graveside. We expected 
a reaction from the older class of, people, but all agreed that it was at least 
worth a try.</p> 
<p>The construction of a mausoleum known as the Rose of Sharon was started in 
1940 and was completed in 1942. At one end of the mausoleum, contrasting shades 
of marble formed a cross, called the Tomb of the Cross. A private family room 
was available for the mourners.</p> 
<p>As we took visitors through the mausoleum, we explained that they could 
leave the body resting here after a funeral service, and it would be taken to 
the grave after the family departed. The reaction was terrible at first. Rumors 
started that we showed the casket only, and gave the body to the State of Iowa 
for medical purposes; that we had water in the graves and were afraid to let 
people go to the grave for fear they would see the water.</p> 
<p>It has always been our practice to contact the family when a death occurred 
and this opposition made it all the more necessary for us to call on the family 
to explain the purpose of the chapel service and ask them to request it from 
the funeral director. We also asked the pallbearers to stay that they, too, 
might go to the grave with the body to see it lowered. We have always reported 
to the family after each funeral and in many cases, found the pallbearers had 
said they, too, had stayed to see the casket lowered. When the families told us 
that everything was done wonderfully, we knew the resistance was broken.</p> 
<p>We always visit the family before the funeral, to determine the type of 
service they desire, whether it be military or fraternal. When the funeral 
procession arrives at the mausoleum, the funeral director escorts the casket to 
the door, where it is placed upon the carriage to be taken to the front of the 
mausoleum. The music system is playing softly as the family proceeds to the 
family room. It is turned down while the pastor gives the committal service, 
and is turned up again as the family departs.</p> 
<p>During a military service, the flag escort stands at attention until the 
casket passes. As soon as the casket is placed on the carriage, and is taken to 
the front, the flag bearers follow, go to the front, and form a semicircle 
around the casket. The pastor is on one side, the commanders of the 
veterans&rsquo; organizations on each side of the casket; the firing squad is 
outside the building so that the volley is muffled. Taps is sounded by the 
bugler in the distance, making a very impressive service.</p> 
<p>Chapel services are more beautiful and the family is out of the cold of the 
winter and the rain and heat of the summer. It is a service which no other 
cemetery in our locality can offer. We have no snow to shovel, no carpet to be 
laid, no tent to put up. We simply dig the grave, put in the grave lining, and 
lower the casket.</p> 
<p>This service has been so highly accepted that today the tent is put up 
about six or seven times a year to accommodate certain religious requirements. 
It is a great saving in labor. It is a nicer service all the way around for the 
family. When you report to the family after the service, they tell you how 
pleased they were about it, and how nice it was to leave their loved one among 
the beautiful flowers and not resting over an open grave.</p> 
<p>We are happy to tell you that the many hours of hard work put forth on this 
project were not in vain, as hundreds of families are now appreciating these 
chapel committal services.</p>
