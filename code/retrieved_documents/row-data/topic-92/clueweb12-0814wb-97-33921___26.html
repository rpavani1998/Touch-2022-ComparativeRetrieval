<li>This is a good time to have your soil tested. Be prepared to raise soil pH 
with lime or lower soil pH with iron sulfate this spring according to the 
written recommendations you receive. &nbsp; For more information on soil 
testing see:
<ul> 
<li>Leaflet 142 - Why Test Your Soil</li> 
<li>HG 110 - Selecting and Using a Soil Testing Laboratory</li> </ul> </li> 
</ul> 
<ul> 
<li>Bare soil is prone to erosion and should be covered with mulch, cover 
crops (GE 006), groundcovers (HG 89), or turf. </li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li>Poor, compacted soils can be improved through the generous addition of 
organic matter. This spring, spade or till in a 6-8 inch layer of leaf compost 
or well-rotted manure.</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li>If you want to grow vegetables, flowers or herbs next spring and your soil 
is especially poor, consider building a raised bed and fill it with a purchased 
mixture of topsoil and leaf compost.</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li>Fruit trees are fertilized in the spring. Landscape trees are 
traditionally fertilized after they drop their leaves in the fall. Mature shade 
trees do not typically need to be fertilized at all. Keep dry fertilizers 
sealed up in your shed or basement to keep critters out.</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li>Do not attempt to melt ice this winter with granular garden fertilizers. 
They are very corrosive to concrete and metal, can burn plants and contribute 
to waterway pollution. Select alternative materials containing combinations of 
magnesium chloride or calcium magnesium acetate (FS 707). Other formulas 
containing sodium chloride, potassium chloride and calcium chloride are also 
suitable but can be corrosive and burn plants if not applied correctly. Avoid 
products containing urea. Keep all ice melting materials away from landscape 
plants. Sand is good to use to improve traction on slippery surfaces.</li> </ul>
<ul> 
<li>Shredded leaves make excellent mulch and are easy to come by. Keep wood 
mulches away from the house. Mulches should be applied only 2-3 inches deep 
around ornamental plants and kept away from shrub and tree trunks. Mature trees 
do not benefit from being mulched, except to keep mowers away from the trunk.
</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li>Mulch perennial beds, trees and shrubs with fallen leaves. This will help 
to protect crowns and shallow root systems from severe cold weather.</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li>Keep sticks, roots and woody stems out of your compost pile. They take too 
long to breakdown and make it difficult to turn the ingredients. Microbes 
continue to break down organic materials until temperatures drop below 40 
degrees F. The composting process will slow down considerably when temperatures 
dip below 50 degrees F. Turning the pile every 2 weeks will hasten the 
breakdown process.</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li>Compost piles should be at least one cubic yard in volume to heat up 
properly. An even mixture of green, high nitrogen and brown, high carbon 
materials is necessary for rapid composting. Grass clippings and spent plants 
from the flower and vegetable garden provide a good source of high nitrogen, 
green materials for the compost pile. Fallen leaves and old straw mulch are 
good sources of high carbon, brown materials. Shred your materials with a 
lawnmower, string trimmer or machete to speed-up the breakdown process. It is 
not necessary to buy a bioactivator to add to the compost pile. To learn more 
about Backyard Composting, seeHG 35.</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li>Finished compost is the very best starter material for a compost pile 
because it contains nitrogen and a huge number of microbes. It is also not 
necessary to add soil or lime to a compost pile. Consider placing a tarp or lid 
over your pile to prevent waterlogging and nutrient leaching over the fall and 
winter. Kitchen scraps thrown on top of compost piles may attract pest animals. 
It is best to bury these scraps in the middle of your compost pile.</li> </ul>

<p>FEBRUARY</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Be careful to keep ice melting products away from landscape plants. Avoid 
using granular fertilizers to melt ice. The fertilizer can cause browning of 
nearby landscape plants and is corrosive to concrete and metal. Also, the 
fertilizer salts run-off onto paved surfaces and are washed down storm drains 
and into waterways. Use coarse sand to improve traction on walkways and 
magnesium chloride products to melt ice. (FS 707)<br>

<ul> 
<li>Now is a good time to have your soil tested (HG 110) if you have not had 
your lawn or garden soil tested for the past 3-4 years. It is also a good time 
to apply lime and organic matter to the soil surface where it is required. 
Don&rsquo;t incorporate these materials until the soil is dry enough to work. 
Low fertility, compacted soils can be improved through the generous addition of 
organic matter. Spade or till in a 6-8 inch layer of compost.</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li>Avoid the temptation to turn over or dig into wet soil. Tilling wet soil 
can cause it to become cloddy and brick hard when it dries out. How do you know 
when your soil can be turned or tilled? One test is to form a clump of your 
soil into a ball. Bounce it up and down in your hand a few times. If it breaks 
apart easily it&rsquo;s probably OK to work.</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li>If you want to grow vegetables, flowers or herbs this spring and your soil 
is especially poor, consider building a raised bed and filling it with a 
purchased mixture of topsoil and leaf compost.</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li> Many home gardeners over use fertilizers. This results in excessive 
nutrient runoff and water pollution. Over-fertilization especially with 
fertilizers high in nitrogen, can lead to overly-succulent, weak growth and 
encourage sucking insect pests like scales, aphids and adelgids. Most landscape 
plants get adequate nutrition from a healthy soil rich with organic matter.<br>

</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li>Whenever broadcasting granular fertilizers near sidewalks and drives 
always sweep them from paved surfaces to prevent them from washing into storm 
drains and waterways.</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li>Plants that typically benefit the most from fertilizer are those that are 
producing either flowers or fruits such as flowering annuals and vegetables. 
Apply a soluble fertilizer to the root system and or foliage to encourage quick 
establishment. Compost tea, fish emulsion, seaweed extracts, and soluble plant 
foods can all be used. Additional fertilizers are often unnecessary if 
well-managed beds are receiving yearly applications of a least one inch of 
compost.</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li>Mulches should be applied only 2-3 inches deep around ornamental plants 
and kept away from direct contact with shrub and tree trunks. Mature trees do 
not benefit much from being mulched except to provide a protective barrier 
around their trunks from riding lawn mower damage.</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li>Your compost pile will begin to come back to life this month. When your 
pile dries out a bit, try to mix or turn the remaining ingredients to hasten 
decomposition. If your pile is overly wet and smelly, mix in some dry materials 
high in carbon, like shredded newspaper, straw or shredded leaves. Be sure to 
bury kitchen scraps deep inside your outdoor compost pile to prevent offensive 
odors that might also attract rodents.</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li>Compost piles should be at least one cubic yard in volume to heat up 
properly (3ft. x 3ft x 3ft.) It is not necessary to buy a bioactivator to add 
to the compost pile. Finished compost is the very best starter material for a 
compost pile because it contains nitrogen and a huge number of microbes. It is 
also unnecessary to add soil or lime to a compost pile. Consider placing a tarp 
or lid over your pile to prevent water logging and nutrient leaching. (HG 35)

<p><strong>Soil Improvement</strong></p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Poor, compacted soils can be improved through the generous addition of 
organic matter.&nbsp; This spring, spade or till in a 6-8 inch layer of leaf 
compost or well-rotted manure. If you want to grow vegetables, flowers or herbs 
this year and your soil is especially poor, consider building a raised bed and 
filling it with a purchased mixture of topsoil and leaf compost.&nbsp;</li> 
</ul> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Avoid the temptation to turn over or dig into wet soil.&nbsp; This can 
cause long-term damage to the structure of your soil.&nbsp; Squeeze a handful 
of soil and bounce it up and down in your hand.&nbsp; If it breaks apart easily 
you can dig it; if it holds together it&rsquo;s too wet to dig.</li> </ul> 
<p>&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> 
<p><strong>Fertilizing Plants</strong></p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Fertilize plants according to their specific needs based on soil test 
recommendations.&nbsp; Trees are typically fertilized after they drop their 
leaves in the fall, not in the spring.&nbsp; Mature shade trees do not 
typically need to be fertilized because most will benefit from some additional 
nutrition when the lawn is fertilized. (HG 23)&nbsp; </li> </ul> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Avoid the temptation to fertilize ornamental garden plants that appear to 
be healthy and productive.&nbsp; Over-fertilization, especially with those high 
in nitrogen, can lead to overly succulent, weak growth and encourage sucking 
insect pests like scales, aphids and adelgids.<strong></strong></li> </ul> 
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> 
<ul> 
<li>It is not a good idea to apply fertilizer to cool season turf in the 
spring unless your turf is weak and thin or if you did not fertilize this past 
fall.&nbsp; When selecting a lawn fertilizer choose those containing a minimum 
of 40% water insoluble nitrogen. Fertilizing in the spring encourages rapid 
succulent growth that is more susceptible to attack by insects and disease. (HG 
103) </li> </ul> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Fertilize spring flowering bulbs now while the foliage is green with a 
balanced fertilizer like 5-10-5, 10-6-4 or 10-10-10.&nbsp; This can be very 
helpful for young or weak bulbs.&nbsp; Fertilizing now will strengthen the bulb 
for best bloom next year.</li> </ul> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Rhododendrons and azaleas can be fertilized with a balanced fertilizer 
after the bloom period.</li> </ul> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Soluble starter fertilizers can be applied to the foliage or root-zone of 
spring crops to get them off to a fast start.&nbsp; Whenever applying 
fertilizer granules always sweep it off of driveways and sidewalks.&nbsp; 
Otherwise the fertilizer will wash into the storm sewers and eventually into 
the Bay.</li> </ul> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;<strong>Mulches</strong></p> 
<ul> 
<li>Mulches should be applied only 2 inches deep around ornamental plants and 
kept away from shrub and tree trunks.&nbsp; Mature trees do not benefit from 
being mulched except to keep riding lawn mowers from damaging the trunks.&nbsp; 
(FS 553) Also see Mulching for a Healthy Landscape.&nbsp;</li> </ul> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Compost</strong></p> 
<ul> 
<li>As the weather continues to get warmer the composting process will 
increase as well.</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li>This is a good time to turn compost piles, remove any large woody 
materials, and add a nitrogen source to accelerate the breakdown process.&nbsp; 
(HG 35) </li> </ul> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
<ul> 
<li>When making a compost pile, make it at least one cubic yard in volume to 
heat up properly.&nbsp; An even mixture of green, high nitrogen and brown, high 
carbon materials is necessary for rapid composting.&nbsp; Grass clippings and 
spent plants from the flower and vegetable garden provide a good source of high

animals.&nbsp; It is best to bury these scraps in the middle of your compost 
pile or in garden soil.&nbsp;</li> </ul>

<p>Soil</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Earthworms are a sign of healthy soil. Contrary to popular belief, heavy 
rains don't drown earthworms (they have no lungs) or drive them out of the 
ground. They come to the surface during wet periods to mate more freely. They 
die because they dry out or are parasitized by insects and diseases. Soil 
insecticides will also drive them out of the soil. Poor, compacted soils can be 
improved through the generous addition of organic matter. Spade or till in a 
6-8 inch layer of leaf compost or well-rotted manure.</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li>We are getting into the thunderstorm season. Bare soil is prone to erosion 
and should be covered with mulch, groundcovers, or turf. Avoid the temptation 
to turn over or dig into soil too soon after rain. Turning over wet soil can 
cause long-term compaction damage to the structure of your soil. Test your soil 
for workability by forming a clump of soil into a ball. If it breaks apart 
easily it&rsquo;s probably OK to work. If you want to grow vegetables, flowers, 
or herbs and your soil is especially poor, consider building a raised bed and 
filling it with a purchased mixture of topsoil and leaf or manure compost.</li> 
</ul> 
<p>Fertilizer</p> 
<ul> 
<li>For optimum plant growth fertilize plants according to their specific 
needs based on soil test recommendations. Trees are typically fertilized after 
they drop their leaves in the fall, not in the spring. Mature shade trees do 
not typically need to be fertilized at all. Trees get more than enough 
fertilizer when turf is fertilized in the fall.</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li> Bluegrass and fescue turf are fertilized in the fall as well. Spring 
fertilization of lawns is not necessary unless you failed to fertilize in the 
fall or your turf is weak, thin and pale. When selecting a lawn fertilizer 
choose those containing a minimum of 40% water insoluble nitrogen. June is the 
last time that you should fertilize your cool season lawn for the spring.</li> 
</ul> 
<ul> 
<li>To prevent nutrient pollution of groundwater and the Chesapeake Bay keep 
fertilizers off of hard surfaces like driveways and sidewalks. Be cautious when 
fertilizing areas of your yard that border these hard surfaces.</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li>Avoid the temptation to fertilize ornamental garden plants that appear to 
be healthy and productive. Over-fertilization, especially with those high in 
nitrogen, can lead to overly succulent, weak growth and encourage sucking

<ul> 
<li>Mulches should be applied only 2-3 inches deep around ornamental plants 
and kept away from shrub and tree trunks.</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li> Very large mulch piles may undergo anaerobic digestion leading to the 
formation of compounds like ethanol and methanol that can damage plants. Break 
these piles up and allow them to dry out before using the mulch.</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li> Various slime molds, like &ldquo;dog-vomit&rdquo; fungi and stinkhorn 
fungi, may be observed now growing in mulch. Although not harmful to plants, 
they are unsightly and can be broken up, turned under, or removed.</li> </ul> 
<p>Compost</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Compost contains major and minor nutrients important for plant growth and 
can be used in flower, herb and vegetable beds to substitute for commercial 
fertilizers.</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li> Compost piles should be at least one cubic yard in volume to heat up 
properly. An even mixture of green (high nitrogen) and brown (high carbon) 
materials is necessary for rapid composting. Grass clippings and spent plants 
from the flower and vegetable garden provide a good source of 
&ldquo;green&rdquo; materials for the compost pile. Fallen leaves and old straw 
mulch are good sources of &ldquo;brown&rdquo; materials. You can hasten the 
composting process by shredding materials, turning the pile, maintaining an 
even mixture of high nitrogen and high carbon materials, and by keeping the 
pile moist. If your pile is overly wet and smelly, mix in some dry materials 
high in carbon, like shredded newspaper, straw or shredded leaves.</li> </ul>

<ul> 
<li>Earthworms are a sign of healthy soil and are normally seen in the 
greatest numbers in fall and spring. Adding organic matter in the form of 
composted leaves, manure, grass clippings, etc. will improve soil structure and

<p>Mulch</p> 
<ul> 
<li> Maryland summers typically include hot, dry weather. A good mulch 
covering will help plants survive the stress of summer and keep weeds in check. 
To be effective mulches should be applied only 2-3 inches deep around 
ornamental plants and kept away from shrub and tree trunks. Mature trees do not 
benefit from being mulched except to keep lawnmowers and string trimmers at bay.
</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li>Select pine bark or hardwood mulches, not wood chips, for use around your 
home to minimize the possibility of attracting termites. Avoid any hardwood 
mulches that contain chunks.</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li>Avoid buying or using mulches that have been stored in large, high piles 
and smell of alcohol. Very large mulch piles may undergo anaerobic digestion 
leading to the formation of compounds like ethanol and methanol that can damage 
plants. Break these piles up and allow them to dry out before using the mulch.
</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li>Various slime molds, like &ldquo;dog-vomit fungi and stinkhorn fungi, may 
also be observed now growing in mulch. These are harmless but are unsightly and 
can be broken up, turned under or removed.</li> </ul> 
<p>Compost</p> 
<ul> 
<li> If your pile is overly wet and smelly, tear it apart and mix in some dry 
materials high in carbon, like shredded newspaper, straw or shredded leaves. 
Contrary to popular belief, it is not at all helpful to layer different 
ingredients when building a pile. Mixing together materials of different 
textures will promote faster decay. Many kinds of invertebrates live in a 
compost pile including manure worms, centipedes, millipedes, pill bugs, and 
pseudoscorpions. They are part of the composting ecosystem and should be 
appreciated, not feared or destroyed. You may see large numbers of soldier fly 
larvae in your compost pile, especially if the pile is wet. These large, beige 
colored maggots are part of the compost food web. The adult flies are 
beneficial insects.</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li>Compost piles should be at least one cubic yard in volume to heat up

<ul> 
<li>To prevent burning of the foliage sweep granular fertilizers off plant 
foliage. The &ldquo;ready mix&rdquo; liquid feed applicators are not as 
damaging since they are specially formulated to be applied directly to the 
foliage. To help prevent nutrient pollution of groundwater and the Chesapeake 
Bay sweep fertilizers off of hard surfaces like driveways and sidewalks. Avoid

attract termites like wood chips.</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li>Avoid buying or using mulches that have been stored in large, high piles 
and smell of alcohol or methanol. The alcohol in the mulch will damage or 
possibly kill your plants. If you get a load of mulch delivered that has a 
strong alcohol smell, simply spread open the pile and let it air out for a few 
days to permit the alcohol to evaporate out.</li> </ul>

<li> Do not fertilize shade trees, fruit trees or shrubs at this time. 
Fertilization in August is very likely to stimulate new growth at a time this 
fall when plants are beginning to enter dormancy and could result in excessive 
winter damage. Trees are typically fertilized after they drop their leaves in 
the fall. Mature shade trees do not need to be fertilized every year. Bluegrass 
and fescue turf is also fertilized in the fall. Help protect the Bay by using 
fertilizers wisely. Fertilizers and lime should be applied in accordance with 
soil test recommendations. Overuse of nitrogen fertilizers may contribute to 
groundwater pollution. Avoid getting fertilizer on sidewalks and driveways 
where it may wash into storm drains, streams and eventually into the Bay</li> 
</ul> 
<ul> 
<li> Avoid the temptation to fertilize ornamental garden plants that appear to 
be healthy and productive. Over-fertilization, especially with fertilizers that 
are high in nitrogen, can lead to overly succulent, weak growth and encourage 
sucking insect pests like scales, aphids and adelgids.<br>
<br>
</li> </ul> 
<p>Mulch</p> 
<ul> 
<li> Various mushrooms and slime molds, like &ldquo;dog-vomit&rdquo; fungi and 
stinkhorn fungi, may be observed now growing in mulch. These are unsightly but 
harmless. In addition to slime molds, toadstools and other mushrooms may emerge 
around root systems and from mulched beds. They are harmless to plants, if you 
don&rsquo;t like them they can be simply knocked over.</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li>Don&rsquo;t lay down mulches containing large wood chips around your home. 
These may attract termites. Hardwood or pine mulches that are predominantly 
bark are recommended.<br>
</li> </ul> 
<p>Compost</p> 
<ul> 
<li> If your compost pile is overly wet and smelly, tear it apart and mix in 
some dry materials high in carbon, like shredded newspaper, straw or shredded 
leaves. Be sure to bury kitchen scraps deep inside your outdoor compost pile. 
Exclude animal fats and oil.</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li>Contrary to popular belief, it is not helpful to layer different 
ingredients when building a pile. Mixing together materials of different 
textures will promote faster decay.</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li> Many kinds of interesting invertebrates live in a compost pile including 
manure worms, centipedes, millipedes, pill bugs, and pseudoscorpions. They are 
part of the composting ecosystem and should be appreciated, not feared. Do not 
attempt to spray or otherwise kill these beneficial critters.</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li> Compost piles should be at least one cubic yard in volume to heat up 
properly. It is not necessary to buy a bioactivator to add to the compost pile. 
Finished compost is the very best starter material for a compost pile because 
it contains nitrogen and a huge number of microbes. It is also not necessary to 
add soil or lime to a compost pile.(HG 35)</li> </ul>

Soil</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Adding organic matter in the form of composted leaves, composted manure, 
chopped up spent flowers and vegetable plants, grass clippings, etc. will 
improve soil structure, increase soil fertility and help you produce healthier 
plants.</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li>Now is a good time to have your soil tested, if you have not had your lawn 
or garden soil tested for the past 3-4 years. Many growing problems can be 
solved by correcting soil deficiencies. Refer to our website for information on 
soil testing.</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li>Winter cover crops can be planted now on bare garden soil. Sow the 
following species individually or in a combination: hairy vetch, winter rye, 
oats, winter wheat. Mix the seeds with soil and broadcast them by hand or use a 
hand held broadcasting seeder. Gently rake the seeds and walk on the bed to 
ensure good soil to seed contact. Your cover crop will protect your soil, 
conserve soil nutrients and add valuable organic matter and nutrients when 
tilled in next spring.</li> </ul> 
<p>Fertilizer<br>
</p> 
<ul> 
<li>It is still too early to fertilize shade trees, fruit trees or shrubs. It 
could promote new growth at a time when perennial plants are beginning to enter 
dormancy and could result in increased winter damage. Trees are typically 
fertilized after they drop their leaves in the fall. Mature shade trees do not 
typically need to be fertilized at all. They also get some benefit from the 
fertilizer applied to the lawn.</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li>Bluegrass and fescue turf is fertilized in the fall. When fertilizing an 
established lawn, select lawn fertilizers that contain mostly nitrogen.</li> 
</ul> 
<ul> 
<li>To reduce nutrient pollution of groundwater and the Chesapeake Bay, keep 
fertilizers off hard surfaces like driveways and sidewalks. Use caution when 
fertilizing areas of your yard that border these hard surfaces.</li> </ul> 
<p>Mulch<br>
</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Mulches should be applied only 2-3 inches deep around ornamental plants 
and kept away from shrub and tree trunks. Mature trees do not benefit from 
being mulched, except to keep damaging lawn mowers away from the trunks.</li> 
</ul> 
<p>Compost<br>
</p> 
<ul> 
<li>With fall comes the leaves that drop; they are a valuable resource to 
gardeners. Add them to your existing compost pile, or start a new one. Strive 
to incorporate a mixture of green, high nitrogen materials like grass 
clippings, spent plants and kitchen waste with dry materials high in carbon, 
like shredded newspaper, straw or shredded leaves. Water the pile if it becomes 
dry. Kitchen scraps thrown on top of compost piles may attract pest animals. It 
is best to bury these scraps in the middle of your compost pile. Contrary to 
popular belief, it is not necessary to &ldquo;layer&rdquo; different 
ingredients when building a pile But simply mixing together materials of 
different textures will promote faster decay. Many kinds of invertebrates live 
in a compost pile including manure worms, centipedes, millipedes, pill bugs, 
and pseudoscorpions. They are part of the composting ecosystem and should be 
appreciated, not feared. Consider placing a cover over your compost bin this 
fall to keep excess water from slowing the breakdown process and prevent 
nutrient leaching.</li> </ul>

<p>Soil</p> 
<ul> 
<li> Bare soil is prone to erosion especially over the winter and should be 
covered with mulch, groundcovers or turf.</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li> Avoid the temptation to turn over or dig into wet soil. This can cause 
long-term damage to the structure of your soil. Poor, compacted soils can be 
improved through the generous addition of organic matter. Spade or till in a 
6-8 inch layer of leaf compost or well-rotted manure.</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li> If you want to grow vegetables, flowers or herbs next spring and your 
soil is especially poor, consider building a raised bed this fall and filling 
it with a purchased mixture of topsoil and leaf compost.Watch our step-by-step 
video - How to Build a Raised Bed.</li> </ul> 
<p>Fertilizer</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Keep leftover bags of fertilizer wrapped up securely in heavy plastic bags 
or solid containers. Rodents will often chews holes in fertilizer bags looking 
for food.</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li> Help protect the Bay by using fertilizers wisely. Fertilizers and lime 
should be applied in accordance with soil test recommendations. Overuse of 
nitrogen fertilizers may contribute to groundwater pollution. To prevent 
nutrient pollution of groundwater and the Chesapeake Bay keep fertilizers off 
hard surfaces like driveways and sidewalks. Be cautious when fertilizing areas

</li> </ul> 
<p>Mulch</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Mulches should be applied only 2-3 inches deep around ornamental plants 
and kept away from shrub and tree trunks. Established, mature shade trees do 
not benefit much from being mulched, except to keep mowers from bumping into 
their trunks. Mulch perennial beds, trees and shrubs with fallen leaves to help 
protect crowns and shallow root systems from severe cold weather. Don&rsquo;t 
begin mulching your perennials until after the first hard freeze- around 
late-November. This will help to keep the soil cold during winter preventing 
freezing and thawing extremes that often heaves perennials out of the soil.</li>
</ul> 
<p>Compost</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Fall is a good time to start a compost pile by mixing together spent 
plants, kitchen scraps, fallen leaves, old mulch and grass clippings. Shred 
your materials with a lawnmower, string trimmer or machete to speed-up the 
breakdown process. Keep twigs, branches and other woody materials out of the 
pile. (video)</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li> Barrel and tumbler type composters work well in small spaces but need to 
be closely monitored to insure a proper mix of green and brown materials and 
adequate moisture levels. A disadvantage of barrels is that they are too small 
to heat up quickly. Compost piles should be at least one cubic yard in volume 
to heat up properly.(HG 35)</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li> Consider placing a tarp or lid over your compost pile to prevent 
waterlogging and nutrient leaching. Be sure to bury kitchen scraps deep inside 
your outdoor compost pile.</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li> An even mixture of green, high nitrogen and brown, high carbon materials 
is necessary for rapid composting. Grass clippings and spent plants from the 
flower and vegetable garden provide a good source of high nitrogen, green 
materials for the compost pile. Fallen leaves and old straw mulch are good 
sources of high carbon, brown materials.</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li> When you have a particularly serious insect or disease problem in your 
garden, do not compost the affected plants.</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li>Here are some ideas for dealing with fallen tree leaves: 
<ul> 
<li>Shred them with a mulching lawnmower and leave them in place (as long as 
they don&rsquo;t completely cover your grass.)</li> 
<li>Shred them and add them to your compost pile.</li> 
<li>Cover your garden soil with shredded leaves.</li> 
<li>Mulch perennials, trees and shrubs with shredded leaves.</li> 
<li>Run them over with a mulching mower, bag them up and use them as a mulch 
next year.<br>

<p>Soil</p> 
<ul> 
<li> Now is a good time to have your soil tested. </li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li> Bare soil, especially on slopes is prone to erosion and should be covered 
with mulch, groundcovers or turf.</li> </ul> 
<ul> 
<li> Avoid the temptation to turn over or dig into wet soil. This can cause 
long-term damage to the structure of your soil. To test if your soil is 
workable take a fist full and squeeze it, if it stays in a tight clump it is 
still too wet to be worked. If it breaks apart it is dry enough to be 
cultivated. Poor, compacted soils can be improved through the generous addition 
of organic matter. Spade or till in a 6-8 inch layer of leaf compost or 
well-rotted manure.</li> </ul> 
<p>Fertilizer</p> 
<ul> 
<li> Do not attempt to melt ice with granular garden fertilizers. Not only do 
they pollute the watershed, they are corrosive to concrete and metal, and can 
burn plants.. Use sand to improve traction on walkways and magnesium chloride 
(not sodium chloride) products to melt ice. Store leftover bags of fertilizer 
in metal containers.<br>
</li> </ul> 
<p>Mulch</p> 
<ul> 
<li> Mulch should be applied only 2-3 inches deep around ornamental plants and 
kept away from shrub and tree trunks. Deep mulch makes a favorable mulch for 
voles. If the mulch is next to woody plant trunks, the voles will feed on and 
damage bark and wood. Mature trees do not benefit from being mulched.</li> </ul>
<ul> 
<li> Mulch perennial beds, trees and shrubs with fallen leaves to help protect 
crowns and shallow root systems from severe cold weather.<br>
</li> </ul> 
<p>Compost</p> 
<ul> 
<li> In the winter, the composting process will slow down considerably as 
temperatures dip below 50&deg;F. Turning the pile every 2 weeks will hasten the 
breakdown process. An even mixture of green, high nitrogen and brown, high 
carbon materials is necessary for rapid composting. Grass clippings and spent 
plants from the flower and vegetable garden provide a good source of high 
nitrogen, green materials for the compost pile. Fallen leaves and old straw 
mulch are good sources of high carbon, brown materials. Shred your materials 
with a lawnmower, string trimmer or machete to speed-up the breakdown process.

<li> Redworms will not survive the winter outdoors and are of no benefit in 
the compost bin. Redworm bins can be set-up in your kitchen or basement over 
the winter to compost kitchen waste. (HG 40) </li> </ul>
