Interpretation AGENCY: Wage and Hour Division, Labor. ACTION: Final Rule. 
----------------------------------------------------------------------- 
SUMMARY: This Final Rule revises the child labor regulations to incorporate 
statutory amendments to the Fair Labor Standards Act and to update and clarify 
the regulations that establish protections for youth employed in 
nonagricultural occupations. These revisions also implement specific 
recommendations made by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and 
Health in its 2002 report to the Department of Labor. The Department of Labor 
is revising the regulations to incorporate the 2008 amendment to section 16(e) 
of the Fair Labor Standards Act that substantially increased the maximum 
permissible civil money penalty an employer may be assessed for child labor 
violations that cause the death or serious injury of a young worker. DATES: 
Effective Dates: This rule is effective July 19, 2010. The incorporation by 
reference of American National Standards Institute standards in the regulations 
is approved by the Director of the Federal Register as of July 19, 2010. FOR

revisions in this Final Rule continue the Department of Labor's tradition of 
fostering permissible and appropriate job opportunities for working youth that 
are healthy, safe, and not detrimental to their education. The Regulatory 
Information Number (RIN) identified for this rulemaking changed with the 
publication of the 2010 Spring Regulatory Agenda due to an organizational 
restructuring. The old RIN was assigned to the Employment Standards 
Administration, which no longer exists. A new RIN has been assigned to the Wage 
and Hour Division. I. Background The child labor provisions of the Fair Labor 
Standards Act (FLSA) establish a minimum age of 16 years for employment in 
nonagricultural occupations, but the Secretary of Labor is authorized to 
provide by regulation for 14- and 15-year-olds to work in suitable occupations 
other than manufacturing or mining, and during periods and under conditions 
that will not interfere with their schooling or health and well-being. The 
child labor provisions of the FLSA permit 16- and 17- year-olds to work in the 
nonagricultural sector without hours or time limitations, except in certain 
occupations found and declared by the Secretary to be particularly hazardous or 
detrimental to the health or well-being of such workers. The regulations for 
14- and 15-year-olds are known as Child Labor Regulation No. 3 (Reg. 3) and are 
contained in subpart C of part 570 (29 CFR 570.31-.37). Reg. 3 limits the hours 
and times of day that such minors may work and identifies occupations that are 
either permitted or prohibited for such minors. Under Reg. 3, 14- and 
15-year-olds may work in certain occupations in retail, food service, and 
gasoline service establishments, but are not permitted to work in certain other 
occupations (including all occupations found by the Secretary to be 
particularly hazardous for 16- and 17-year-olds). Reg. 3, originally 
promulgated in 1939, was revised to reflect the 1961 amendments to the FLSA, 
which extended the Act's coverage to include enterprises engaged in commerce or 
the production of goods for commerce and thereby brought more working youth 
employed in retail, food service, and gasoline service establishments within 
the protections of the Act. The regulations concerning nonagricultural 
hazardous occupations are contained in subpart E of 29 CFR part 570 (29 CFR 
570.50-.68). These Hazardous Occupations Orders (HOs) apply on either an 
industry basis, specifying the occupations in a particular industry that are 
prohibited, or an occupational basis, irrespective of the industry in which the 
work is performed. The seventeen HOs were adopted individually during the 
period of 1939 through 1963. Some of the HOs, specifically HOs 5, 8, 10, 12, 
14, 16, and 17, contain limited exemptions that permit the employment of 16- 
and 17-year-old apprentices and student-learners under particular conditions to 
perform work otherwise prohibited to that age group. The terms and conditions 
for employing such apprentices and student-learners are detailed in Sec. 
570.50(b) and (c). Because of changes in the workplace, the introduction of new 
processes and technologies, the emergence of new types of businesses where 
young workers may find employment opportunities, the existence of differing 
federal and state standards, and divergent views on how best to balance 
scholastic requirements and work experiences, the Department has long been 
reviewing the criteria for permissible child labor employment. A detailed 
discussion of the Department's review was included in the Notice of Proposed 
Rulemaking published in the Federal Register on April 17, 2007 (see 72 FR 
19339). Congress twice amended the child labor provisions of the FLSA in the 
1990s. The Compactors and Balers Safety Standards Modernization Act, Public Law 
104-174 (Compactor and Baler Act), was signed into law on August 6, 1996. This 
legislation added section 13(c)(5) to the FLSA, permitting minors 16 and 17 
years of age to load, but not operate or unload, certain scrap paper balers and 
paper box compactors when certain requirements are met. The Drive for Teen 
Employment Act, Public Law 105-334, was signed into law on October 31, 1998. 
This legislation added section 13(c)(6) to the FLSA which prohibits minors 
under 17 years of age from driving automobiles and trucks on public roadways on 
the job and establishes the conditions and criteria for 17-year-olds to drive 
automobiles and trucks on public roadways on the job. The Department published 
a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) in the Federal Register on November 30, 
1999 (64 FR 67130), inviting comments on revisions of regulations to implement 
[[Page 28405]] the 1996 and 1998 amendments and to update certain regulatory 
standards. In 1998, the Department provided funds to the National Institute for 
Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) to conduct a comprehensive review of 
scientific literature and available data in order to assess current workplace 
hazards and the adequacy of the current child labor HOs to address them. This 
study was commissioned to provide the Secretary with another tool to use in her 
ongoing review of the child labor provisions, and of the hazardous occupations 
orders in particular. The report, entitled National Institute for Occupational 
Safety and Health (NIOSH) Recommendations to the U.S. Department of Labor for 
Changes to Hazardous Orders (hereinafter referred to as the NIOSH Report or the 
Report), was issued in July of 2002. The Report, which makes 35 recommendations 
concerning the existing nonagricultural HOs and recommends the creation of 17 
new HOs, also incorporated the comments NIOSH submitted in response to the 1999 
NPRM. The Report is available for review on the Department's YouthRules! Web 
site athttp:/ /www.youthrules.dol.gov/resources.htm. The Department recognizes 
NIOSH's extensive research efforts in compiling and reviewing this data. 
However, it has cautioned readers about reaching conclusions and expecting 
revisions to the existing HOs based solely on the information in the Report. In 
the Report, NIOSH itself recognized the confines of its methodology and 
included appropriate caveats about the limitations of the available data and 
gaps in research. Of those limitations, the following are worth noting. The 
NIOSH Report recommendations are driven by information on high-risk activities 
for all workers, not just patterns of fatalities and serious injuries among 
young workers. There is little occupational injury, illness, and fatality data 
available regarding minors less than 16 years of age. In addition, such data 
for youth 16 and 17 years of age tend to be mixed with that of older workers 
whose employment is not subject to the child labor provisions of the FLSA. 
Also, available occupational injury, illness, fatality, and employment data on 
the specific operations in the specific industries covered by the NIOSH Report 
recommendations tend to be combined with data on other operations and/or 
industries. In some cases, this may result in a diminution of the risk by 
including less risky operations and industries in the employment estimates. In 
other cases, the risk may be exaggerated by including more dangerous 
operations/industries in the injury, illness, or fatality estimates. In 
addition, as NIOSH was tasked with examining issues within the framework of the 
current HOs only, the Report did not consider the extent to which fatalities 
occur despite existing HOs, Occupational Safety and Health Administration 
(OSHA) standards, or state laws prohibiting the activity. If fatalities result 
from recognized illegal activities, such as working with fireworks or a 
power-driven circular saw, the best strategy for preventing future injuries may 
not be to revise the regulations but to increase compliance with existing laws 
through public awareness initiatives, targeted compliance assistance efforts, 
and stepped-up enforcement activities. The Report also did not consider 
potential approaches for decreasing workplace injuries and fatalities that 
provide an alternative to a complete ban on employment, such as safety 
training, increased supervision, the use of effective personal protective 
equipment, and strict adherence to recognized safe working practices. Though 
cognizant of the limitations of the Report, the Department places great value 
on the information and analysis provided by NIOSH. Since receiving the Report, 
the Department has conducted a detailed review and has met with various 
stakeholders to evaluate and prioritize each recommendation for possible 
regulatory action consistent with the established national policy of balancing 
the benefits of employment opportunities for youth with the necessary and 
appropriate safety protections. The Department's 2004 Final Rule addressed six 
of the recommendations. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2004, Public Law 
108-199, Sec. 108, which was signed into law on January 23, 2004, amended the 
FLSA by creating a limited exemption from the child labor provisions for minors 
14 to 18 years of age who are excused from compulsory school attendance beyond 
the eighth grade. The exemption, contained in section 13(c)(7) of the FLSA, 
allows eligible youth, under specific conditions, to be employed inside and 
outside of places of business that use machinery to process wood products, but 
does not allow such youth to operate or assist in operating power-driven 
woodworking machines. This exemption overrides the FLSA's formerly complete 
prohibition on the employment of 14- and 15-year-olds in manufacturing 
occupations contained in section 3(l). The Department proposed revisions of the 
child labor regulations to implement the 2004 legislation, address 25 of the 
remaining 29 NIOSH Report recommendations dealing with existing nonagricultural 
hazardous occupations orders, and revise and/or clarify the permitted and 
prohibited occupations and industries and conditions and periods of employment 
established for 14- and 15-year-olds by Reg. 3, in an NPRM published in the 
Federal Register on April 17, 2007 (72 FR 19337). The NPRM also proposed to 
incorporate into the regulations three long- standing enforcement positions 
regarding the cleaning of power-driven meat processing equipment, the operation 
of certain power-driven pizza- dough rollers, and the definition of high-lift 
trucks. In addition, the Department proposed to expand the HO that prohibits 
youth from operating power-driven circular saws, band saws, and guillotine 
shears to also prohibit the operation of power-driven chain saws, wood 
chippers, and reciprocating saws. Finally, the Department proposed to revise 
subpart G of the child labor regulations, entitled General Statements of 
Interpretation of the Child Labor Provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 
1938, as Amended, to incorporate all the changes adopted by the agency since 
this subpart was last revised in 1971. The Genetic Information 
Nondiscrimination Act of 2008 (GINA) (Pub. L. 110-233) was enacted into law on 
May 21, 2008, after the publication of the 2007 NPRM. GINA, among other things, 
amended FLSA section 16(e) to provide that any person who violates the 
provisions of sections 12 or 13(c) of the FLSA, relating to child labor, or any 
regulation issued pursuant to such sections, shall be subject to a civil money 
penalty not to exceed $11,000 for each employee who was the subject of such a 
violation. In addition, GINA also permits the assessment of a civil money 
penalty up to $50,000 with regard to each violation that caused the death or 
serious injury of any employee under the age of 18 years. That penalty may be 
doubled, up to $100,000, when such violation is determined by the Department to 
be a repeated or willful violation. These changes in the law became effective 
May 21, 2008. As mentioned, the NIOSH Report made 35 recommendations concerning 
the existing nonagricultural HOs. The Department addressed six of those 
recommendations in the 2004 Final Rule published December 16, 2004 (see 69 FR 
75382). The Department, in the April 17, 2007 NPRM, based on its determination 
that there was sufficient [[Page 28406]] data available, addressed 25 of the 
remaining 29 NIOSH Report recommendations dealing with the existing 
nonagricultural hazardous occupations orders. In an attempt to acquire 
additional data needed to address the remaining nonagricultural NIOSH 
recommendations and to pursue certain other issues not explored in the NIOSH 
Report, the Department also published an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking 
(ANPRM) concurrently with the 2007 NPRM (see 72 FR 19328). Because very little 
substantive information was received, the Department withdrew the ANPRM on 
February 24, 2010. No proposed rule will result directly from that information 
collection effort, however, the topics discussed in the ANPRM may be the 
subject of a future rulemaking. The comments submitted in response to the ANPRM 
may be reviewed at the Federal eRulemaking Portal athttp://www.regulations.gov, 
docket identification number WHD-2007-0001. The NIOSH Report also made 14 
recommendations that impact the current agricultural HOs and recommended the 
creation of 17 new HOs. The Department, in the ANPRM published on April 17, 
2007, requested public comment on the feasibility of one of those 
recommendations regarding the creation of a new HO that would prohibit the 
employment of youth in construction occupations. The Department is continuing 
to review all of the remaining NIOSH Report recommendations, but excluded them 
from immediate consideration in order to keep the size and scope of the 2007 
ANPRM and NPRM manageable. Their absence from this current round of rulemaking 
is not an indication that the Department believes them to be of less importance 
or that they are not being given the same level of consideration as the 
recommendations addressing the current nonagricultural HOs. In that regard, the 
Department is nearing completion of its thorough review of the NIOSH 
recommendations that address the agricultural hazardous occupations orders. II. 
Summary of Comments A total of 28 comments were received and are available for 
review at the Federal eRulemaking Portal athttp://www.regulations.gov. The 
Docket ID for the NPRM that generated these comments is WHD-2007-0002. Comments 
were received from trade and professional associations; advocacy and 
occupational health and safety organizations; employers; federal, state, and 
local government agencies; representatives of schools and organizations that 
provide vocational training to youth; and one private citizen. The one private 
citizen comment, which concerned the issue of door-to-door sales, was 
incorrectly submitted to the ANPRM docket by the commenter and was assigned a 
Document ID of WHD-2007-0001-0004. One commenter, the International Association 
of Amusement Parks and Attractions, included comments from three of its member 
organizations along with its submission. Four of the comments do not address 
any of the issues raised by the April 17, 2007 NPRM and focus solely on topics 
raised by the ANPRM that was published by the Department on that same day. One 
commenter, the National Children's Center for Rural and Agricultural Health and 
Safety, did not address any specific proposal but expressed concerns that the 
Department has not yet implemented the NIOSH Report recommendations for 
agricultural HOs. In regards to the nonagricultural youth provisions, it stated 
that ``it does not appear that protection of youth workers is at the heart of 
some of the proposed changes, but rather the needs of industry and special 
interest groups.'' Many of the comments concerned a single issue or a cluster 
of issues impacting a single industry, but two comments were quite extensive 
and addressed almost every proposal raised by the NPRM. These comprehensive 
comments were submitted by the Young Workers Health and Safety Network (YWN) 
and the Child Labor Coalition (CLC). The Department appreciates the time and 
effort all of these commenters devoted to their submissions. The YWN is a 
subcommittee of the Occupational Health and Safety Section of the American 
Public Health Association. It described itself as an informal network of public 
health professionals, advocates, and government agency staff that includes 
individuals from academia, public health, labor law enforcement, health and 
safety consultation and/or enforcement, labor organizations, and educators. The 
YWN reported that, in formulating its comments, it tried to use the following 
principles: The regulations should protect youth from significant hazards; 
where possible, the regulations should be kept clear and consistent, limiting 
the number of exceptions or exemptions, thus fostering better compliance and 
more effective enforcement; and, the regulations should allow youth to do a 
broad variety of different types of potentially rewarding work. The CLC, which 
has more than 30 member organizations, described itself as the largest grouping 
in the United States of advocates for the protection of the safety, health, and 
education of working children. The CLC reported that its comments are also 
endorsed by the following organizations: A Better World Foundation, A Minor 
Consideration, American Federation of Teachers, American Federation of School 
Administrators, Americans for Democratic Action, Association of Farmworker 
Opportunity Programs, Farmworker Justice, International Initiative to End Child 
Labor, Migrant Legal Action Program, National Association of State Directors of 
Migrant Education, National Consumers League, Ramsay Merriam Fund, and the 
United Food and Commercial Workers International Union. The CLC stated that its 
comments are in line with its stated mission and objectives, which include 
creating a network for the exchange of information about child labor, providing 
a forum and a unified voice on protecting working minors and ending child labor 
exploitation, and developing informational and educational outreach to the 
public and private sectors to combat child labor abuses and to promote 
progressive initiatives and legislation. The American Federation of Labor and 
Congress of Industrial Organizations (AFL-CIO), while submitting its own 
comments, also endorsed those submitted by the CLC. III. Regulatory Revisions 
Many of the revisions being made by this Final Rule will result in the 
redesignation of several sections and subsections of the regulations. In order 
to prevent confusion when providing citations in this discussion, the 
Department will provide, when appropriate, both the current citation (the 
citation prior to the effective date of this Final Rule) and the new citation 
(the citation that will apply on and after the effective date of this Final 
Rule). For example, the section of Reg. 3 that prohibits 14- and 15-year-olds 
from employment in occupations in connection with warehousing and storage would 
be cited as Sec. 570.33(f)(2)(old) or Sec. 570.33(n)(2)(new). A. Occupations 
That Are Prohibited for the Employment of Minors Between the Ages of 14 and 16 
Years of Age (29 CFR 570.31-.34) Section 3(l) of the FLSA defines oppressive 
child labor to expressly prohibit children under the age of 16 from performing 
any work other than that which the Secretary of Labor permits, by order or 
regulation, upon [[Page 28407]] finding that it does not interfere with their 
schooling or health and well-being (see 29 U.S.C. 203(l), see also 29 CFR 
570.117-.119). Before 14- and 15-year-olds may legally perform work covered by 
the FLSA, the Act requires that the work itself be exempt, or that the 
Secretary determines that the work to be performed does not constitute 
oppressive child labor. The Secretary's declarations of what work is not deemed 
oppressive for children between the ages of 14 and 16 appear in Reg. 3 (29 CFR 
570.31-.37). Reg. 3 identifies a number of occupations and activities that are 
specifically prohibited for these minors without regard to the industry or the 
type of business in which their employer is engaged (e.g., operating or tending 
any power-driven machinery other than office machines, see Sec. 570.33(b) (old) 
and Sec. 570.33(e) (new)). Reg. 3 also incorporates by reference all of the 
prohibitions contained in the Hazardous Occupations Orders (29 CFR 570.50-.68), 
which identify occupations that are ``particularly hazardous'' and, therefore, 
prohibited for 16- and 17-year-olds (e.g., occupations involved in the 
operation of power-driven metal forming, punching, and shearing machines, see 
Sec. 570.33(e) (old) and Sec. 570.33(b) (new)). As previously mentioned, Reg. 3 
was revised to reflect the 1961 amendments to the FLSA which extended the Act's 
coverage to include enterprises engaged in commerce or the production of goods 
for commerce and thereby brought more working youth employed in retail, food 
service, and gasoline service establishments within the protections of the Act. 
The current Sec. 570.34(a) expressly authorizes the performance of certain 
activities by 14- and 15-year-olds in retail, food service, and gasoline 
service establishments, while Sec. 570.34(b) details those activities that 14- 
and 15-year-olds are expressly prohibited from performing in such 
establishments. For example, clerical work, cashiering, and clean-up work are 
authorized, whereas ``all work requiring the use of ladders, scaffolds, or 
their substitutes'' is prohibited. These special rules currently apply only in 
the designated types of business. Since 1961, new, positive, and safe 
employment opportunities have opened up for youth in industries other than 
retail, food service, and gasoline service that the existing Reg. 3 does not 
specifically address. Jobs in such areas as state and local governments, banks, 
insurance companies, advertising agencies, and information technology firms all 
normally fall outside of the permitted establishments declared in Reg. 3. 
Because these jobs are not specifically permitted by Sec. 570.33 (old), they 
are prohibited. There has been some confusion about this over the years. Some 
employers believe that 14- and 15-year-olds are permitted to be employed in any 
industry or occupations not expressly prohibited by Reg. 3, or that any 
employer in any industry is permitted to employ such youth in the occupations 
permitted by Sec. 570.34(a) (old). However, when those jobs are not located in 
retail, food service, or gasoline service establishments, the provisions of 
Sec. 570.34 (old) (both authorizations and prohibitions) do not apply to the 
employment of 14- and 15-year-olds. The exception to this rule is where there 
is some discrete operation or division that could legitimately be characterized 
as such an establishment and therefore would be subject to these rules (e.g., 
minors employed in a food service operation at a city park or a publicly owned 
sports stadium). The existing Reg. 3 prohibits employers such as state and 
local governments, banks, insurance companies, advertising agencies, and 
information technology firms from employing 14- and 15-year-old workers in any 
jobs other than those that occur in those discrete operations or divisions that 
could be characterized as retail, food service, or gasoline service 
establishments. In 2004, in recognition of the importance of youth employment 
programs operated by public sector employers that provide safe and meaningful 
developmental opportunities for young people, and in response to specific 
requests received from two municipalities, the Department adopted an 
enforcement position that permits state and local governments to employ 14- and 
15-year-old minors under certain conditions. Consistent with its enforcement 
position, the Department exercised its prosecutorial discretion, as authorized 
by 29 U.S.C. 216(e), and declined to cite Reg. 3 occupations violations for the 
employment of 14- and 15-year-olds by state and local governments as long as 
that employment fell within the occupations authorized by Reg. 3 (Sec. 
570.34(a) (old)) and did not involve any of the tasks or occupations prohibited 
by Reg. 3 (Sec. Sec. 570.33 and 570.34(b) (old)). The Department enforced all 
the other provisions of Reg. 3, including the restrictions on hours of work, 
with respect to the employment of such minors. The Department's administration 
of this enforcement position permitting the employment of 14- and 15-year-olds 
by state and local governments has had extremely positive results. There are 
indications, as reported by state and local governments and reflected in WHD 
enforcement findings, that when such youth are employed under the guidelines 
established by the enforcement position, that employment does not interfere 
with their schooling or with their health and well- being, and thus is in 
accordance with the directive of the FLSA. Based upon the success of the above 
enforcement position, the Department, in the April 17, 2007 NPRM, proposed to 
revise and reorganize Sec. Sec. 570.33 and 570.34 to clarify and to expand the 
list of jobs that are either permitted or prohibited for minors who are 14 and 
15 years of age. The Department also proposed to remove the language that 
limited the application of Sec. 570.34 to only retail, food service, and 
gasoline service establishments. As proposed, the revised Sec. 570.33 detailed 
certain specific occupations prohibited for 14- and 15-year-olds. This revision 
also necessitates a change to Sec. 570.35a(c)(3) (old) because it references 
Sec. Sec. 570.33 and 570.34 as they pertain to Work Experience and Career 
Exploration Programs (WECEPs). The Department proposed to retain all the 
current prohibitions contained in Sec. 570.33 but would modify the prohibition 
regarding the employment of 14- and 15-year-olds in manufacturing occupations 
to comport with the provisions of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2004, 
which enacted section 13(c)(7) of the FLSA. The NPRM proposed to continue to 
allow the employment of 14- and 15- year-olds in all those retail, food 
service, and gasoline service establishment occupations in which they are 
currently permitted to be employed. The Department also proposed to apply to 
FLSA-covered nonagricultural employers of minors, with certain modifications, 
all the permitted occupations contained in Sec. 570.34(a) (old) and all the 
prohibited occupations contained in Sec. 570.34(b) (old) that currently apply 
only to retail, food service, and gasoline service establishments. This 
proposal would be accomplished by revising Sec. 570.34 to identify permitted 
occupations. The Department also proposed to continue to permit youth 14- and 
15-years of age to perform those occupations involving processing, operating of 
machines, and working in rooms where processing and manufacturing take place, 
that are currently permitted under Sec. 570.34(a) (old), as referenced in Sec. 
570.34(b)(1) (old). As mentioned, certain modifications to the existing lists 
of permissible and prohibited occupations were also [[Page 28408]] proposed. 
The traditionally prohibited occupations and industries would, after adoption 
of the proposal, be contained in a revised Sec. 570.33, and all the permitted 
occupations and industries would be contained in a revised Sec. 570.34. The 
Department is aware that, given the FLSA's mandate that before 14- or 
15-year-olds may legally be employed to perform any covered work, the Secretary 
of Labor must first determine that the work to be performed does not constitute 
oppressive child labor, it could choose to publish only a list of permissible 
occupations and industries, and not provide a list of certain commonly arising 
prohibited occupations and industries. However, the Department believes that by 
continuing the long-standing Reg. 3 tradition of publishing lists of those 
occupations and industries in which such youth may be employed as well as 
detailed examples of those industries and occupations in which the employment 
of such youth is prohibited, it can greatly enhance the public's understanding 
of these important provisions. The list of prohibited industries and 
occupations helps to define and to provide clarity to the list of permitted 
industries and occupations. However, the list of prohibited occupations is not 
intended to identify every prohibited occupation, but rather only to provide 
examples of those prohibited occupations that have historically been the most 
common sources of violations or concern. As previously explained, any job not 
specifically permitted is prohibited. The Department also understands that, 
given the constant development and changes occurring in the modern workplace, 
in continuing to provide a definitive list of permitted occupations and 
industries, it may unintentionally discourage the creation of positive and safe 
employment opportunities for young workers. But the Department believes that, 
by continuing its past practice of carefully reviewing inquiries regarding 
individual occupations or industries not currently addressed by Reg. 3 and then 
exercising its prosecutorial discretion and issuing enforcement positions that 
may eventually lead to rulemaking--as evidenced by certain revisions contained 
in this Final Rule--it has developed an efficient and effective mechanism which 
overcomes the limitations of a definitive list. The Department firmly believes 
that the limited and public exercise of its prosecutorial discretion is an 
efficient and legal tool available to the Secretary in the administration of 
the child labor provisions of the FLSA. The modifications to the list of 
prohibited occupations are as follows: 1. Prohibited Machinery (Sec. Sec. 
570.33-.34) Section 570.33(b) (old) prohibits youth 14 and 15 years of age from 
employment in occupations involving the operation or tending of any 
power-driven machinery other than office equipment. The Department has always 
interpreted the term power-driven machinery very broadly to include machines 
driven by electrical, mechanical, water, or other power such as steam or 
hydraulic. The term also includes battery- operated machines and tools, but 
does not apply to machines or tools driven exclusively by human hand or foot 
power. Even though this prohibition is clear and quite broad, other sections of 
Reg. 3 have traditionally named certain pieces of power- driven machinery so as 
to eliminate any doubt or confusion as to their prohibited status. For example, 
Sec. 570.34(a)(6) (old) prohibits the employment of 14- and 15-year-olds in the 
operation of power-driven mowers or cutters and Sec. 570.34(b)(6) (old) 
prohibits the employment of such minors in occupations that involve operating, 
setting up, adjusting, cleaning, oiling, or repairing power-driven food 
slicers, grinders, choppers, and cutters, and bakery-type mixers. The 
Department proposed to combine Sec. Sec. 570.33(b), 570.34(a)(6), and 
570.34(b)(6)--all of which address power-driven machinery--into a single 
paragraph located at Sec. 570.33(e) and expand the list of examples of 
prohibited equipment to include power- driven trimmers, weed-eaters, edgers, 
golf carts, food processors, and food mixers. Even though Reg. 3 for many years 
has prohibited the employment of 14- and 15-year-olds to operate any 
power-driven equipment other than office machines, the Department routinely 
receives inquiries as to the status of these individual pieces of equipment 
under Reg. 3. The Department believes that by continuing to reference certain 
common prohibited machinery by name, both clarity and compliance will be 
increased. The Department received six comments on this proposal. The YWN, CLC, 
and AFL-CIO supported the proposal to consolidate those subsections of Reg. 3 
dealing with power-driven machinery into a single, new subsection located at 
Sec. 570.33(e) and to expand the list of prohibited machinery, with certain 
caveats. The YWN and the AFL-CIO recommended that 14- and 15-year-olds also be 
prohibited from using espresso makers because, as the YWN reported, these 
machines involve a potential for serious burns. They create steam at a 
temperature that ``clearly exceeds the temperature limits established for 
prohibiting use of other equipment such as anything related to hot oil that 
exceeds a temperature of 100 degrees F.'' A representative of the Billings, 
Montana Job Service also questioned how the Department's proposal addresses the 
employment of youth who operate espresso machines. The AFL-CIO and the CLC 
recommended that all-terrain vehicles (ATVs) be added to the list of prohibited 
machinery because, as the CLC reported ``The serious hazards of operating ATVs 
have been extensively documented.'' Neither commenter provided any data or 
insight regarding how extensively ATVs are used by youth in nonagricultural 
employment or whether the documented hazards resulted in occupational injuries. 
The CLC also recommended that the proposed Sec. 570.33 include an introductory 
statement reinforcing the principle detailed in Sec. 570.32 (new) that all work 
that is not specifically permitted is prohibited. The YWN also recommended that 
the Department specifically list ``bladed blenders used to chop food items such 
as cookies or candy with ice cream to make ice cream desserts'' as a prohibited 
machine in the revised Sec. 570.33(e) as that subsection already prohibits the 
operating or tending of food grinders, food choppers, and cutters (see Sec. 
570.34(b)(6) (old)). The National Council of Chain Restaurants (the Council), 
which described itself as a national trade industry group representing the 
interests of the nation's largest multi-unit, multi-state chain restaurant 
companies, requested that the proposed Sec. 570.33(e) include additional 
language which would emphasize that 14- and 15-year- olds would continue to be 
permitted to operate all those pieces of kitchen equipment listed in Sec. 
570.34(a)(7) (old) once the Final Rule becomes effective. The Council commented 
that it believes table top food processors and food mixers pose little risk of 
harm to the safety and well-being of 14- and 15-year-olds and questions why the 
Department continues to prohibit such youth from operating them (see Sec. 
570.34(b)(6) (old) and Sec. 570.33(e) (new)). The Council submitted no data to 
substantiate this comment. The Director of the Labor Standards and Safety 
Division of the Alaska State Department of Labor and Workforce [[Page 28409]] 
Development (DOLWD) also supported the consolidation and listing of prohibited 
equipment with some exceptions. The DOLWD recommended that 14- and 15-year-olds 
should be permitted to operate weed eaters that use monofilament line (but not 
weed eaters that use metal blades) provided adequate eye and hearing protection 
are in place. That same office recommended that such youth be permitted to 
operate certain small, residential-sized washing machines and dryers when all 
safety equipment is properly installed. The Department has carefully reviewed 
the comments and has decided to adopt the proposal, as presented, with one 
modification. The Department will add ATVs to the list of prohibited equipment 
presented in the revised Sec. 570.33(e) (new) as recommended by the AFL-CIO and 
CLC. As power-driven equipment, ATVs were, and continue to be, included in the 
broad prohibitions of this subsection. In addition, because ATVs are motor 
vehicles as defined by Sec. 570.52(c) (old and new), 14- and 15-year-olds would 
be prohibited from operating such equipment under Sec. 570.33(c) (old) and Sec. 
570.33(f) (new). But because greater clarity and protections can be realized, 
the Department will add ATVs to the list of named equipment. With regard to 
cooking and the use of kitchen equipment, the Department notes that it 
implemented new rules concerning the types of cooking that may be performed by 
14- and 15-year-olds in its Final Rule published in the Federal Register on 
December 16, 2004 (69 FR 75382). That Final Rule limited permitted cooking 
duties to cooking (1) with electric or gas grills which does not involve an 
open flame (see Sec. 570.34(b)(5)(i) (old) and Sec. 570.34(c) (new)), and (2) 
cooking with deep fryers that are equipped with and utilize a device which 
automatically lowers the baskets into the hot oil or grease and automatically 
raises the baskets from the hot oil or grease (see Sec. 570.34(b)(5)(ii) (old) 
and Sec. 570.34(c) (new)). The 2004 Final Rule, however, did not change the 
types of equipment and devices that 14- and 15-year-olds were permitted to, and 
continue to be permitted to, operate in accordance with Sec. 570.34(a)(7) (old) 
and Sec. 570.34(i) (new). The list of permitted equipment includes, but is not 
limited to, dishwashers, toasters, dumbwaiters, popcorn poppers, milk shake 
blenders, coffee grinders, automatic coffee machines, devices used to maintain 
the temperature of prepared foods, and microwave ovens that do not have the 
capacity to warm above 140 [deg]F. Although there may have been some confusion 
among employers, the Department has long interpreted the term toaster to mean 
that type of equipment that was generally found in snack bars and lunch 
counters when Reg. 3 was issued and used to toast such items as slices of bread 
and English muffins. This includes such equipment as the two- or four- slice 
``pop-up'' toasters similar to those manufactured for home use and the 
conveyor-type bread toaster now often found at self-service breakfast buffets. 
Broilers, automatic broiler systems, high speed ovens, and rapid toaster 
machines used at both quick service and full- service restaurants to toast such 
items as buns, bagels, sandwiches, and muffins--all of which operate at high 
temperatures, often in excess of 500 [deg]F--are not toasters under Sec. 
570.34(a)(7) (old) and Sec. 570.34(i) (new) and minors generally must be at 
least 16 years of age to operate them. There has also been some confusion among 
employers as to what constitutes a milk shake blender under Reg. 3. The 
Department has long interpreted this term to mean that type of equipment that 
was generally found in snack bars and lunch counters when Reg. 3 was issued and 
used to prepare a ``to-order'' milk shake for an individual customer. Such 
equipment required that the worker place the ice cream, milk, and flavorings in 
a stainless steel mixing cup that generally has a maximum capacity of 20 
ounces. The cup was then positioned on the machine so that the single 
spindle--with an aeration disk or disks mounted at the bottom--could blend the 
milk shake. Some permitted milk shake blenders had more than one spindle so 
multiple products could be processed simultaneously. Most of these blenders 
were free standing counter-top models while others were incorporated into other 
equipment such as milk dispensers. These are the types of milk shake blenders 
that 14- and 15- year-olds may operate under Reg. 3. Except as described below, 
other types of blenders, mixers, and ``blixers''--used for a variety of food 
preparation operations including the blending of milk shakes--continue to be 
prohibited to that age group. Such prohibited equipment often have containers 
or mixing chambers that exceed a 20-ounce capacity--some can accommodate up to 
60 quarts. In addition, some of this prohibited equipment, when used to process 
meat or mix batter--with or without the use of special ``attachments''--may not 
be operated by employees under the age of 18 because of the prohibitions of HO 
10 or HO 11, respectively. The Department has also included certain countertop 
blenders used to make beverages such as milk shakes, fresh fruit drinks, and 
smoothies within the term milk shake blender as used in Reg. 3. Such machines 
generally consist of a base motor that supports a glass jar. The blending 
blades are attached, often permanently, to the bottom of the glass jar. 
Operators place the glass jar on top of the base, place the ingredients in the 
jar, affix the lid to the jar, press the appropriate button or switch, and 
blend the product. The permitted blenders are identical to models used in 
private homes, generally do not operate at more than 600 watts, and have jar 
capacities that do not exceed 8 cups (64 ounces). As with the blenders 
discussed above, their operation by minors under the age of 18 is prohibited 
under HO 10 when used to process meat. For these reasons, the Department does 
not agree with the YWN's understanding that the existing regulation prohibits 
14- and 15-year- olds from operating blenders that create ice cream desserts as 
the Department has previously opined that this equipment is a type of ``milk 
shake blender'' which has long been permitted by Sec. 570.34(a)(7) (old) and 
will continue to be permitted by Sec. 570.34(i) (new). The Department also 
notes that Reg. 3 has for many years prohibited young workers from operating 
compact power mixers or blenders, also know as ``immersible wands'' and 
``immersion blenders,'' used for such tasks as liquefying soups and sauces and 
pureeing fruits, meats, and vegetables. Such equipment is often used in 
kitchens and by dietary aides at hospitals and nursing homes. The use of such 
equipment would also be prohibited by HO 10 when the mixer or wand is equipped 
with knives, blades, or cutting tools designed for use on meat and poultry. The 
Department did not propose to prohibit, and the Final Rule does not prohibit, 
14- and 15-year-olds from operating espresso machines as recommend by the YWN, 
the AFL-CIO, and the representative of the Billings, Montana Job Service. 
Section 570.34(a)(7) (old) specifically includes automatic coffee machines on 
the list of equipment that 14- and 15-year-olds may operate (see Sec. 570.34(i) 
(new)). The Department has previously opined that espresso makers and 
cappuccino makers are types of automatic coffee machines and therefore 14- and 
15- year-olds are permitted to operate them under the provisions of Reg. 3. The 
Department notes that the YWN's comment that the temperature reached by 
espresso makers ``exceeds the temperature limits [[Page 28410]] established for 
prohibiting use of other equipment such as anything related to hot oil that 
exceeds a temperature of 100 degrees F'' does not comport with either the 
previous or revised provisions of Reg. 3. The temperature of 100[deg] F, when 
presented in Sec. 570.34(a)(7) (old) and Sec. 570.34(i) (new), does not apply 
to the operation of kitchen equipment or to such permitted activities as 
cooking with certain grills or deep fryers. Instead, these subsections state 
that the minors are permitted to ``clean kitchen equipment (not otherwise 
prohibited), remove oil or grease, pour oil or grease through filters, and move 
receptacles containing hot grease or hot oil, but only when the equipment 
surfaces, containers, and liquids do not exceed a temperature of 100 [deg]F.'' 
The Department has decided not to adopt the Council's recommendation to revise 
Reg. 3 to permit 14- and 15-year-olds to operate table top food processors and 
food mixers as no such proposal was contemplated by the NPRM and no data has 
been received that demonstrates that 14- and 15-year-olds can safely operate 
such equipment. The Department does, however, address the issue of older youth 
operating certain counter-top mixers later in this Final Rule with regard to HO 
11. The Department does not accept the DOLWD's recommendation that Reg. 3 be 
revised to permit 14- and 15-year-olds to operate certain weed- eaters because 
of the potential for injury associated with the operation of such equipment. In 
fact, as discussed earlier, weed-eaters are among the equipment the Department 
is adding as an example of power-driven machinery such youth are prohibited 
from operating (see Sec. 570.33(e) (new)). The Department continues to be 
concerned about issues involving injuries to workers resulting from flying 
objects, burns, fuel safety, and improper ergonomics. In its Document 5108, 
Weed Trimmers Can Throw Objects and Injure Eyes, the U.S. Consumer Product 
Safety Commission estimated that, in 1989, there were approximately 4,600 
injuries associated with power lawn trimmers or edgers that required emergency 
room treatment. It reported that about one-third of those injuries were to the 
eye. Nor does the Department accept DOLWD's recommendation to allow 14- and 
15-year-olds to operate certain residential-style clothes washers and dryers. 
Not only is the operation of such power-driven machinery prohibited by Sec. 
570.33(b) (old) and Sec. 570.33(e) (new), the laundering of clothes and other 
materials generally constitutes a ``processing occupation'' which is prohibited 
under Sec. 570.33(a) (old and new). Finally, the Department has determined that 
the Final Rule provides sufficient clarity that it is not necessary to adopt 
the CLC's recommended revision to the opening sentence of Sec. 570.33 to repeat 
the statement contained in Sec. 570.32 (``Employment that is not specifically 
permitted is prohibited.''). For the same reason, the Department has decided 
not to accept the Council's recommendation that Sec. 570.33(e) be revised to 
emphasize that youth will continue to be permitted to operate all kitchen 
equipment they were permitted to operate prior to the adoption of this Final 
Rule, as the list of permissible kitchen equipment is set forth in Sec. 
570.34(i)(new). 2. Loading of Personal Hand Tools Onto Motor Vehicles and 
Riding on Motor Vehicles (Sec. Sec. 570.33(f) and 570.34(b)(8)) Section 
570.33(c) (old) prohibits the employment of 14- and 15- year-olds in the 
operation of motor vehicles or service as helpers on such vehicles. The term 
motor vehicle is defined in Sec. 570.52(c)(1). The Department has interpreted 
the Reg. 3 prohibition regarding service as helpers on a motor vehicle to 
preclude youth under the age of 16 from riding anywhere outside the passenger 
compartment of the motor vehicle. Such youth may not ride in the bed of a 
pick-up truck, on the running board of a van, or on the bumper of a refuse 
truck. This interpretation dates back to at least the 1940 enactment of HO 2, 
which prohibits 16- and 17-year-olds from serving as outside helpers on motor 
vehicles. The Department does not interpret the helper prohibition as applying 
to 14- and 15-year-olds who simply ride inside a motor vehicle as passengers 
and, thus, Reg. 3 permits a 14- or 15-year-old, under certain circumstances, to 
ride inside the enclosed passenger compartment of a motor vehicle operated by a 
driver whose employment complies with the conditions specified in HO 2. For 
example, a minor may ride in a motor vehicle to reach another work site where 
he or she will perform work, to receive special training or instructions while 
riding, or to meet other employees or customers of the employer. While a 14- or 
15-year old may be a passive passenger in a vehicle, that same minor is not 
permitted to ride in a motor vehicle when a significant reason for the minor 
being a passenger is for the purpose of performing work in connection with the 
transporting--or assisting in the transporting--of other persons or property. 
Such work would include, for example, delivering items to a customer or 
assisting passengers with the loading and unloading of their luggage in 
conjunction with the operation of an airport shuttle van. This interpretation 
comports with the provision of Sec. 570.33(f)(1) (old), which prohibits the 
employment of 14- and 15-year-olds in occupations in connection with the 
transportation of persons or property by highway. Performing work in connection 
with the transportation of other persons or property does not have to be the 
primary reason for the trip for this prohibition to apply. The Department 
proposed to include its long-standing interpretation that prohibits 14- and 
15-year-olds riding outside of motor vehicles in Reg. 3 at Sec. 570.33(f) 
(new). The Department also proposed to revise Reg. 3 at Sec. 570.34(o) (new) to 
permit 14- and 15-year-olds to ride in the enclosed passenger compartments of 
motor vehicles, except when a significant reason for the minors being 
passengers in the vehicle is for the purpose of performing work in connection 
with the transporting--or assisting in the transporting--of other persons or 
property. The proposal required that each minor must have his or her own seat 
in the passenger compartment, each seat must be equipped with a seat belt or 
similar restraining device, and the employer must instruct the minors that such 
belts or other devices must be used. These provisions mirror the requirements 
of the Drive for Teen Employment Act as contained in HO 2. In addition, the 
Department's interpretation of prohibited helper services under Sec. 570.33(c) 
(old), since at least the mid-1950s, has included the loading and unloading of 
materials from motor vehicles when the purpose of the operation of the vehicle 
is the transportation of such materials. Section 570.33(f)(1) (old) furthers 
this prohibition by banning the employment of minors in occupations in 
connection with the transportation of property by highway. Section 570.34(b)(8) 
(old) prohibits the employment of such youth by retail, food service, and 
gasoline service establishments to load or unload goods to and from trucks, 
railroad cars, or conveyors. These prohibitions are designed to protect young 
workers from the hazards associated with loading docks, motor vehicles, and 
receiving departments; strains from lifting and moving heavy items; and falls 
and falling items. Accordingly, 14- and 15-year-olds generally have been 
prohibited from loading and unloading any property (not just ``goods'') onto 
and from motor vehicles, including the light personal hand tools they use in 
performing their duties. [[Page 28411]] In 2000, the Department was requested 
by a municipality (the City) to review certain aspects of the prohibitions 
against employing 14- and 15-year-olds to load onto and unload items from motor 
vehicles. The City advised the Department that, even with the adoption of the 
enforcement position that permits state and local governments to employ minors 
under certain conditions, it was being forced to abandon a youth-employment 
program that provided 14- and 15-year-olds with certain jobs because of the 
prohibition against loading materials into vehicles. The City specifically 
requested permission to allow such minors to load and unload, onto and from 
motor vehicles, the light, non-power-driven tools each youth would personally 
use as part of his or her employment. The Department carefully considered this 
request and, again using its prosecutorial discretion, decided that it would 
not assert a violation of the child labor provisions when 14- and 15- year-old 
employees of state and local governments loaded and unloaded the light 
non-power-driven hand tools--such as rakes, hand-held clippers, and 
spades--that they personally use as part of their employment. The City was 
advised that this enforcement policy did not extend to other prohibited 
transportation-related work such as the loading or unloading of materials other 
than the light hand tools the minors may use on-the-job, such as trash or 
garbage, or power-driven equipment such as lawn mowers, edgers, and weed 
trimmers--the use of which by this age group is prohibited under Reg. 3. The 
Department proposed to revise Reg. 3 at new Sec. Sec. 570.33(f) and (k) and 
570.34(k) to incorporate the enforcement position that allows 14- and 
15-year-olds to be employed to load onto and unload from motor vehicles the 
light non-power-driven personal hand tools they use as part of their employment 
and to make it available to all covered employers, not just state and local 
governments. Such light non-power- driven hand tools would include, but are not 
limited to, rakes, hand- held clippers, shovels, and brooms, but would not 
include items like lawn mowers or other power-driven lawn maintenance 
equipment. In addition, such minors would be permitted to load onto and unload 
from motor vehicles any personal protective equipment they themselves will use 
at the work site and any personal items such as backpacks, lunch boxes, and 
coats their employers allow them to take to the work site. Such minors would 
not be permitted to load or unload such jobsite- related equipment as barriers, 
cones, or signage. The Department received four comments addressing the 
proposal regarding riding on motor vehicles. The AFL-CIO and the DOLWD 
supported this proposal as written. The YWN supported the proposal with 
additional requirements. The YWN recommended that the proposed requirements 
that each seat occupied by a minor be equipped with a seat belt or similar 
restraining device and that the employer instruct the minors that such belts or 
other device must be used so that the employer is required to ensure that the 
seat belt or other device is actually used. In addition, the YWN would require 
that the driver of the vehicle transporting the minors have a valid driver's 
license. The CLC objected to the Department's proposal, stating that it did not 
have sufficient information on the underlying rationale for the proposed change 
to adequately comment on it. The CLC did, however, recommend that the seat 
restraining devices should ``be required to be manufacturer-issued and not 
homemade, and the employer should be required to `ensure,' and not just 
`instruct' that the restraining devices be used by the children.'' The 
Department received four comments concerning the loading of personal hand tools 
onto motor vehicles at Sec. 570.34(k) (new). The AFL-CIO supported the proposal 
as written. The CLC again stated that it did not have enough information to 
adequately comment on the proposal. The YWN agreed with this proposal with the 
added requirements that ``[w]ritten permission from parent or legal guardian is 
required to permit employer to transport 14- and 15-year-olds and a copy of 
written permission must be maintained by employer'' and ``[a] minor cannot be 
abandoned at worksite without adult supervision.'' The DOLWD supported the 
proposal provided adequate safety provisions were in place. The DOLWD stated 
that ``[t]hese provisions would include that the vehicle shall not be running 
and must be properly secured with the wheels blocked during any loading and 
unloading operations.'' After carefully considering all the comments, the 
Department has decided to adopt the proposal as originally written, with one 
modification and minor editorial changes. The Department noted in its 2007 NPRM 
that it did not interpret the Reg. 3 helper prohibitions as applying to 14- and 
15-year-olds who ride inside the enclosed passenger compartment of a motor 
vehicle when driven by a driver whose employment complies with HO 2 under 
specified conditions (see 72 FR 19343). The Department believes this 
long-standing important safety-affecting interpretation requiring compliance 
with HO 2 should be included in the regulatory language. In addition, the 
Department believes that the drivers of the vehicles transporting the young 
workers should, as recommended by the YWN, hold valid state drivers' licenses. 
Accordingly, the Department has added the following sentence at the end of Sec. 
570.34(o): In addition, each driver transporting the young workers must hold a 
State driver's license valid for the type of driving involved and, if the 
driver is under the age of 18, his or her employment must comply with the 
provisions of Sec. 570.52. While the Department appreciates the remaining 
safety-affecting recommendations made by the YWN, CLC, and DOLWD, it believes 
the provisions of the original proposal, when coupled with other existing state 
and federal provisions dealing with the safe operation of motor vehicles, will 
provide ample protections to young workers. In addition, when drafting the 
proposal regarding youth riding as passive passengers in motor vehicles, the 
Department looked for guidance for establishing the criteria regarding the use 
of seat belts or other safety restraining devices. The most recent guidance 
came from Congress with the enactment of The Drive for Teen Employment Act, 
Public Law 105-334, in 1998. This legislation added section 13(c)(6) to the 
FLSA, which permits 17-year-olds to perform certain limited on-the-job driving 
under very specific conditions. One such condition is that the vehicle be 
equipped with a seat belt for the driver and any passengers and that the young 
driver's employer has instructed the youth that the seat belts must be used 
when driving the vehicle. The Department believes by adopting in Reg. 3 the 
identical language contained in HO 2 (see Sec. 570.52(b)), it not only provides 
a high degree of protection to young workers but also avoids potential 
confusion. 3. Work in Meat Coolers and Freezers (Sec. 570.34(b)(7)) Section 
570.34(b)(7) (old) prohibits 14- and 15-year-olds from working in freezers and 
meat coolers. Since this section's inception, the Department has interpreted it 
to mean that such youth are prohibited from working as dairy stock clerks, meat 
clerks, deli clerks, produce clerks, or frozen-food stock clerks where their 
duties would require them to enter and remain in the freezer or meat cooler for 
prolonged periods. [[Page 28412]] Inventory and cleanup work, involving 
prolonged stays in freezers or meat coolers, are also prohibited. On the other 
hand, the Department has adopted an enforcement position since at least 1981 
that counter workers in quick service establishments or cashiers in grocery 
stores whose duties require them to occasionally enter freezers only 
momentarily to retrieve items are not considered to be working in the freezers. 
In order to provide clarification, the Department proposed to incorporate this 
long-standing interpretation into the regulations at Sec. 570.33(i) (new). The 
Department received four comments on this proposal. The Council supported the 
proposal as written. The YWN not only disagreed with the proposal but suggested 
that the current prohibitions detailed at Sec. 570.34(b)(7) (old) be expanded 
to include ``any freezer or cooler regardless of product, including but not 
limited to meat, seafood, poultry or other produce.'' The AFL-CIO supported the 
proposal but suggested that employers be required to keep the door open while 
the minor was inside the freezer, that the freezer door be equipped with an 
emergency release mechanism to ensure the youth can escape if the door is 
mistakenly shut, and that the employer provide unobstructed entry to and egress 
from the freezer. The CLC also made the same three recommendations as the 
AFL-CIO and stated that ``[e]ven if DOL's Occupational Safety and Health 
Administration (OSHA) has similar rules, these should be incorporated into the 
child labor regulations so that a DOL Wage and Hour Division inspector could 
assert a child labor violation rather than having the employer face two 
inspections, one by the Wage and Hour Division and another by OSHA.'' The 
Department has carefully reviewed the comments and has decided to adopt the 
proposal as originally written with a conforming clarification in Sec. 
570.34(i). Even though, under this rule, 14- and 15-year-olds may only 
occasionally enter freezers momentarily to retrieve items (see Sec. 570.33(i) 
(new) and Sec. 570.34(i) (new)), requiring that the door be kept open while 
they are inside the freezer could be unnecessarily burdensome in that, for 
energy efficiency and food sanitation, most freezers are equipped with 
self-closing doors. We note, as reported by the CLC, that OSHA, which is the 
recognized expert in occupational safety and health issues, already has in 
place important safety standards addressing emergency release mechanisms, panic 
bars, and unobstructed paths in the workplace--and that these standards protect 
all workers, not just those under the age of 16. The Department believes that 
all these additional safety requirements, when coupled with the provisions of 
the revised Sec. 570.33(i), adequately protect young workers who momentarily 
enter freezers. WHD and OSHA, as recommended by the CLC, will continue their 
partnership to leverage the education and outreach efforts and enforcement 
actions of each agency. Finally, the YWN's recommendation that the proposal be 
expanded to include specific items being stored in the freezer or cooler, such 
as seafood and poultry, is unnecessary because, as discussed above, Sec. 570.33 
is a non-exhaustive list that only sets forth common examples of prohibited 
occupations. 4. Youth Peddling The Department proposed to amend Reg. 3 and 
create Sec. 570.33(j) to ban the employment of 14- and 15-year-old minors in 
occupations involving youth peddling, also referred to as ``door-to-door 
sales'' and ``street sales.'' Controversies regarding young children conducting 
commercial sales of items, often on a ``door-to-door'' basis, are not new. The 
Department has over the years documented reports of minors, many as young as 10 
or 11 years of age, working as part of mobile sales crews, selling such items 
as candy, calendars, and greeting cards for profit-making companies. Injuries, 
and even deaths, have occurred as the result of young children engaging in 
youth peddling activities. The door-to-door sales industry employing these 
minors generally is composed of a number of crew leaders who, during the course 
of a year, operate in many different states. The crew leaders, who often have 
ties to regional or national businesses, mistakenly claim that they and their 
young sales crews are independent contractors. Typically, a crew leader 
attempts to saturate a particular area with sales crews, make as many sales as 
possible, and then quickly move to a new location. Crews often work from late 
afternoon to late at night as that is when most of the potential customers are 
likely to be at home. Because youth peddlers typically qualify as outside sales 
employees under FLSA section 13(a)(1), they are usually exempt from the minimum 
wage and overtime requirements of the FLSA (see 29 CFR 541.500). Congressional 
hearings and the Department's enforcement experience have shown that the 
problems associated with children performing door- to-door sales and street 
sales are numerous. These youth are often transported by crew leaders in vans, 
which fail to meet proper safety and insurance requirements, to areas quite 
distant from their home neighborhoods. They are often required to work many 
hours on school nights and late into the evening. These minors are frequently 
placed by employers, without adult supervision, at subway entrances, outside 
large office buildings, at high-traffic street corners, and on median strips at 
busy intersections where they can attract potential customers. Reports of 
children being abandoned, suffering injuries from violence and motor vehicle 
crashes, and being exposed to the elements have been substantiated. Youth have 
been injured and have died as a result of these activities. Intimidation by 
crew leaders is commonly reported. In 1987, the permanent Subcommittee on 
Investigations of the Committee on Governmental Affairs of the United States 
Senate held hearings on the Exploitation of Young Adults in Door-to-Door Sales. 
The hearings included a staff study that documented many abuses that had 
occurred in this industry, including indentured servitude, physical and sexual 
abuse, and criminal activity. In 1998, the Interstate Labor Standards 
Association created a subcommittee to work towards ending door-to-door sales by 
children and recommended that the Department of Labor act as a national 
clearinghouse regarding information concerning door-to-door sales operations. 
In response to the 1994 ANPRM issued by the Department, calls for banning 
door-to-door sales by those under 18 years of age were received from the 
National Consumers League, the Defense for Children International, USA, and the 
Food and Allied Service Trades Department, AFL-CIO. At least 17 states have 
rules prohibiting or regulating door-to-door sales by minors. The Department's 
proposal to prohibit youth peddling was not limited to just the attempt to make 
a sale or the actual consummation of a sale, but includes such activities 
normally associated with and conducted as part of the individual youth 
peddler's sales activities, such as the loading and unloading of vans or other 
motor vehicles, the stocking and restocking of sales kits and trays, the 
exchanging of cash and checks, and the transportation of minors to and from the 
various sales areas by the employer. As used here, the terms youth peddling, 
door-to-door-sales, and street sales do not include legitimate fund-raising 
activities by eleemosynary organizations such as cookie sales conducted by the 
Girl Scouts of America or school fund-raising events where the [[Page 28413]] 
students are truly volunteers and are not promised compensation for the sales 
they make. The term compensation would not include the small prizes, trophies, 
or other awards of minimal value that the eleemosynary organization may give a 
volunteer in recognition of his or her fund raising efforts. In administering 
the FLSA, the Department does not consider such individuals, who volunteer or 
donate their services, usually on a part-time basis, for public service, 
religious, or humanitarian objectives, without contemplation of pay, to be 
employees of the religious, charitable, or similar nonprofit corporations that 
receive their services. In addition, FLSA section 3(e)(4)(A) excludes from the 
definition of ``employee'' individuals who volunteer to perform services for 
public agencies. These provisions apply equally whether the volunteer is an 
adult or a minor. The Department received five comments on this proposal. One 
private citizen, who submitted his comment to the electronic docket for the 
ANPRM published on April 17, 2007, was the only commenter to oppose the 
proposal. This commenter stated that through door-to-door sales ``many kids 
learn how to be confident and build communication skills with adults.'' The 
DOLWD supported this proposal and noted that Alaska State regulations restrict 
any worker under the age of 18 from working in door-to-door sales. The YWN, the 
AFL-CIO, and the CLC also supported this proposal and recommended that the 
prohibitions against youth peddling be extended to the employment of 16- and 
17-year-olds. In addition, the YWN recommended that the Department amend the 
first sentence of proposed Sec. 570.33(j) to prohibit sales by youth ``in front 
or around the outside of retail establishments'' as ``many youth peddle wares 
outside grocery stores, large chain or box stores, etc.'' The YWN also 
recommended that the Department not use the term ``eleemosynary'' in the 
regulations but replace it with ``plain English words, such as `non-profit, 
religious or charitable organizations' to assure understanding by all 
parties.'' The YWN assumed that the Department's proposal would also ban the 
employment of 14- and 15-year-olds to perform sign waving, ``including holding 
or carrying of any type, posing or acting as a sign not directly in front of a 
retail establishment, or where no direct supervision exists'' (emphasis in 
original). The YWN recommended that such sign waving activities also be 
prohibited along public roads and grassy areas or median areas next to public 
streets or traffic. The CLC stated that it is not clear whether such sign 
waving activities would be prohibited under the Department's proposal. The CLC 
recommended that the proposal clarify where young employees of retail 
establishments may legally make sales. The CLC assumed that the 
youth-employer's establishment ``means inside or directly outside the 
establishment, but not away from the establishment, such as on a street corner 
or parking lot. This should be made more explicit by barring youth peddling `in 
front or around the outside of the establishment.''' Finally, the CLC noted the 
Department's statement that youth peddlers performing outside sales are usually 
exempt from the minimum wage and overtime provisions of the FLSA and took issue 
with the Department's failure to ban peddling by 16- and 17-year-olds as well. 
The CLC commented that ``DOL's approach here hardly comports with its stated 
desire to balance `the benefits of employment opportunities with the necessary 
and appropriate safety protections' (72 FR 19337). The benefits of an 
employment opportunity in which the children experiencing it are `usually' not 
entitled to minimum wage or overtime pay are difficult to understand.'' The 
Department has carefully reviewed the comments and has decided to adopt the 
proposal with certain clarifying modifications. The Department appreciates the 
concerns raised by the YWN, the AFL-CIO, and the CLC regarding the scope of the 
term youth-employer's establishment. Under Sec. 570.33(j) as originally 
proposed, a retail establishment that sets up an outside sales center to sell 
such things as garden supplies, plants, outdoor furniture, portable grills, 
Christmas trees, etc., that participates in a retailer association neighborhood 
``sidewalk sale'' event, or that routinely displays its wares outside its 
building may question whether it could use its young sales staff in such 
endeavors. In order to eliminate confusion and provide clarity, the Department 
has added a statement to Sec. 570.33(j) noting that the ban on youth peddling 
does not prohibit a young salesperson from conducting sales for his or her 
employer on property controlled by the employer that is out of doors but may 
still properly be considered part of the employer's establishment. Fourteen- 
and 15-year-olds may conduct sales in such employer's exterior facilities, 
whether temporary or permanent, as garden centers, sidewalk sales, and parking 
lot sales, when they are employed by that establishment. The Department agrees 
with the recommendations of both the YWN and CLC that the regulatory text be 
revised to specifically state that 14- and 15-year-olds may not be employed as 
sign-wavers, promoting particular products, services, or events, except when 
performing the sign waving activities directly in front of an establishment 
providing the product, service or event. Because sign wavers and those hired to 
wave or hold up other products, or wear placards, sandwich boards, or costumes 
to attract potential customers are exposed to many of the same dangers 
associated with youth peddling, the following sentence has been added to Sec. 
570.33(j): Prohibited youth peddling also includes such promotion activities as 
the holding, wearing, or waving of signs, costumes, sandwich boards, or 
placards in order to attract potential customers, except when performed inside 
of, or directly in front of, the employer's establishment providing the 
product, service, or event being advertised. The Department appreciates the 
concerns of those commenters who recommended that the ban on youth peddling 
should be extended to all youth under the age of 18 years, but considers such a 
change too substantive to adopt without additional rulemaking. The Department 
notes that the NIOSH Report, after carefully reviewing the available data, did 
not include youth peddling as one of the 17 occupations warranting the creation 
of a new Hazardous Occupations Order (HO). However, the Department appreciates 
the AFL-CIO's recommendation that ``DOL begin gathering the necessary data to 
substantiate and justify the need for extension of this coverage for future 
proposed regulations as quickly as possible.'' Finally, with regard to the 
CLC's comment regarding wages, the fact that youth who conduct door-to-door 
sales usually are exempt from the minimum wage and overtime provisions of the 
FLSA in no way detracts from the Department's stated objective to develop 
updated, realistic health and safety standards for today's young workers that 
are consistent with the established national policy of balancing the benefits 
of employment opportunities for youth with the necessary and appropriate safety 
protections. When Congress enacted the FLSA in 1938, it created section 
13(a)(1), which provides a complete exemption from the minimum wage and 
overtime provisions for employees employed in the capacity of outside salesman. 
The definition of that term, contained in 29 CFR 541.500, applies regardless of 
the age of the [[Page 28414]] employee and clearly includes youth peddlers as 
described in Sec. 570.33(j) (new). The FLSA, as amended, includes other 
exemptions from the minimum wage and overtime provisions that impact jobs often 
performed by young workers, such as those contained in section 13(a)(3) 
(involving employees employed by an establishment which is an amusement or 
recreational establishment, organized camp, or religious or non- profit 
educational conference center); section 13(a)(15) (involving any employee 
employed on a casual basis in domestic service employment to provide 
babysitting services); and section 13(d) (involving any employee engaged in the 
delivery of newspapers to the consumer). The Department cannot enforce a 
minimum wage requirement for employees whom the Congress has statutorily 
exempted from the minimum wage and overtime provisions of the FLSA. Nor can it 
ban certain employment for young workers solely because the employees engaged 
in such employment are exempt from the FLSA's minimum wage and/or overtime 
requirements. The Department notes that the exemption from minimum wage and 
overtime contained in section 13(a)(1) for outside salespeople does not apply 
to individuals employed solely to wave signs or wear placards, sandwich boards, 
or costumes to attract potential customers as such promotion work is not 
performed in conjunction with sales actually made by those individuals (see 
Sec. 541.503). 5. Poultry Catching and Cooping The Department has long taken 
the position that 14- and 15-year- olds may not be employed to catch and coop 
poultry in preparation for transportation or for market because it is a 
``processing'' occupation prohibited by Sec. 570.33(a) (old and new). Such 
employees are often referred to as ``chicken catchers'' or ``poultry 
catchers.'' In addition, the prohibitions against operating or tending 
power-driven equipment contained in Sec. 570.33(b) (old) and Sec. 570.33(e) 
(new) and the prohibition against employment in occupations in connection with 
the transportation of property contained in Sec. 570.33(f)(1) (old) and Sec. 
570.33(n)(1) (new) generally preclude the employment of such youth as poultry 
catchers. These activities are normally performed in environments and under 
conditions that present risks of injury and illness to young workers. Working 
in the dark, with the only illumination provided by ``red lights'' which the 
fowl cannot see, and in poorly ventilated rooms, is not uncommon. The risks 
associated with poultry catching also occur in the catching and cooping of 
poultry other than chickens--for example, processors of turkeys and Cornish 
game hens employ similar methods of moving their products to slaughter. Despite 
the Department's consistent interpretation that 14- and 15- year-olds may not 
be employed as poultry catchers, employers still have questions concerning how 
the regulations address such work, and violations still occur. For example, the 
Department investigated the death of a 15-year-old male in 1999 who was 
employed as a poultry catcher, working in the dark and under red lighting, in 
Arkansas. The youth was electrocuted shortly after midnight when he bumped into 
a fan while performing his ``catching'' duties. In order to remove any 
confusion and increase employer compliance, the Department proposed to amend 
Reg. 3 and create Sec. 570.33(l) to specifically prohibit the employment of 14- 
and 15-year-old minors in occupations involving the catching and cooping of 
poultry for preparation for transport or for market. The prohibition would 
include the catching and cooping of all poultry, not just chickens. It is 
important to note that in those rare instances when the catching activities 
would be agricultural in nature, such as where poultry catchers are employed 
solely by a farmer on a farm to catch poultry raised by that farmer, the 
catchers would be subject to the agricultural child labor provisions contained 
in FLSA sections 13(c)(1) and (2). The Department received three comments on 
this proposal. The YWN, AFL-CIO, and CLC all supported the proposal as written. 
The CLC stated that it welcomes the change as this work is plainly too 
hazardous for 14- and 15-year-olds to perform. The Department is adopting this 
proposal as written with one grammatical change. B. Occupations That Are 
Permitted for Minors Between 14 and 16 Years of Age (29 CFR 570.33-.34) As 
mentioned, section 3(l) of the FLSA expressly prohibits children under the age 
of 16 from performing any work other than that which the Secretary of Labor 
permits, by order or regulation, upon finding that it does not interfere with 
their schooling or health and well-being (see 29 U.S.C. 203(l)). Before a 14- 
or 15-year-old may legally perform work covered by the FLSA, the Act requires 
that the work itself be exempt, or that the Secretary of Labor has determined 
that the work to be performed does not constitute oppressive child labor. The 
Secretary's declarations of what forms of labor are not deemed oppressive for 
children between the ages of 14 and 16 appear in Reg. 3 (29 CFR 570.31-.37) 
(old). Reg. 3 identifies a number of occupations or activities that are 
specifically permitted for the employment of youth 14 and 15 years of age in 
retail, food service, and gasoline service establishments. As mentioned, the 
Department proposed to revise this list of permitted occupations by clarifying 
it, adding to it, and extending its application to all employment covered by 
the FLSA, except those employers engaged in mining or manufacturing, or any 
industry or occupation prohibited by the proposed Sec. 570.33. This revised 
list will be contained in Sec. 570.34 in the Final Rule. The Department 
received six comments concerning the revision of the list of permitted 
occupations and/or the expansion of the list to include establishments other 
than retail, food service, and gasoline service. Two of the commenters made 
recommendations that are beyond the purview of the Department as they would 
require changes to the statute. The DOLWD recommended that the Department focus 
on identifying the specific areas and occupations where work is prohibited and 
eliminate the specific provisions concerning where work is permitted. A 
representative of an educational management company called White Hat 
Management, LLC (White Hat) recommended that the FLSA's blanket prohibition 
against 14- and 15-year-old being employed in manufacturing occupations should 
be relaxed, stating that ``in today's day and age when so many manufacturing 
jobs are automated and operated by computers or buttons, that a blanket 
prohibition for manufacturing employment hardly seems appropriate.'' Such 
recommendations do not comport with the FLSA's statutory directive that 14- and 
15-year-olds may not be employed in manufacturing or mining occupations and may 
only hold such employment that the Secretary has determined, by regulation or 
order, does not constitute oppressive child labor (see 29 U.S.C. 203(l)). The 
AFL-CIO, YWN, and CLC all expressed concern about this proposal, stating that 
such sweeping changes would allow 14- and 15- year-olds to work in many more 
industries, and they recommended that the Department conduct further analysis. 
They specifically mentioned and questioned the efficacy of permitting youth 
employment in particular industries and employment situations. The AFL-CIO, 
YWN, and CLC also noted that this proposal would allow [[Page 28415]] youth to 
perform janitorial and clean-up work, work already permitted within retail, 
food service, and gasoline service establishments by Sec. 570.34(a)(6) (old), 
in additional types of establishments. They stated that such employment 
includes the potential for exposure to hazardous and toxic chemicals or to 
bloodborne pathogens, particularly in medical and dental offices, hospitals and 
nursing homes, and when youth accept employment with professional janitorial 
services. There were also concerns that 14- and 15-year-olds could now become 
full-time janitors and spend an entire shift performing cleaning duties. In 
addition, the CLC interpreted this proposal as having a major impact on 
messenger services. It stated that because Sec. 570.33(d) (old) and Sec. 
570.33(m) (new) prohibit the employment of 14- and 15- year-olds by a public 
messenger service, adoption of this proposal implies that employment of such 
youth by a private messenger service would be permitted. The CLC described 
private messenger services as those that ``have standing contracts with law 
firms, accounting firms, and other types of businesses'' to deliver documents 
or packages. The CLC stated ``[a]ny reasonable person who has seen such 
couriers rushing through city streets, dodging cars, pedestrians, and other 
cyclists to deliver important documents, would shudder to think that 14- and 
15- year-olds would be able to do this work, if DOL's proposal becomes the 
final regulation.'' The CLC stated that adoption of this proposal would allow 
14- and 15-year-olds to perform office work for such employers as accounting 
firms, advertising agencies, mass mailing businesses, insurance companies, and 
many similar businesses. It expressed concerns that office equipment, such as 
large paper shredders and data processing machines with exposed moving parts, 
may present hazards to young workers. In addition, the CLC noted that such 
minors would be permitted to work up to eight hours a day and up to forty hours 
a week at computers, typing or inputting data, during non-school weeks. 
Finally, a representative of the Coosa Valley Regional Development Center 
requested that 14- and 15-year-olds be permitted to be employed in painting 
activities because the ``paint products in use today do not contain lead or 
other hazardous materials.'' She stated that prohibiting this age group from 
painting activities restricts their employment activities. She recommended that 
the prohibitions involving the use of ladders and scaffolds by this age group 
be retained. The Department has carefully reviewed all the comments and has 
decided to adopt the proposal as written. The concerns of the AFL-CIO, YWN, and 
CLC about increased youth employment in several industries, such as dry 
cleaning and laundry services, treating and disposing of waste, mass mailing 
enterprises, and the painting of houses and automobiles, are unfounded. This is 
because Sec. 570.33(a) (old and new) prohibits the employment of 14- and 
15-year-olds in almost all occupations involving processing operations--which 
the Department has interpreted to include dry cleaning and laundering, the 
treating and disposing of waste, the conducting of mass mailings, and the 
painting of houses and automobiles. The Department does not believe it is 
appropriate to overturn the long-standing prohibitions against 14- and 
15-year-olds being employed in construction or processing occupations by 
accepting the recommendation of the Coosa Valley Regional Development Center to 
allow such youth to perform painting activities. In addition, Sec. 570.33(a) 
(old and new) provides additional protections as it prevents the employment of 
such youth in work places where goods are manufactured, mined, or otherwise 
processed. Fourteen- and 15-year-olds could not be employed to clean such work 
places, even after hours, because of WHD's long-standing interpretation that a 
work place retains its character--and child labor continues to be 
prohibited--even at times when nothing is being mined, processed, or 
manufactured. It is also important to note that all the prohibited occupations 
detailed in Sec. 570.33 (new) would be applicable to the employment of 14- and 
15-year-olds, regardless of the industries in which they are employed. The 
Department appreciates and understands the commenters' concerns about the 
potential occupational exposure of young workers to hazardous and toxic 
chemicals or to bloodborne pathogens. The Department believes that the 
standards established by OSHA to address such potential exposures, which are 
continually under agency review, provide vigorous protections to all workers. 
The WHD is also reviewing prohibitions regarding the potential exposure of 
young workers to ionizing radiation, as reflected in the publication of the 
2007 ANPRM. The Department would also note that, as mentioned by the CLC, 14- 
and 15-year-olds have been permitted to be employed by hospitals and nursing 
homes for many years. This is because historically such facilities, when open 
to the general public, have been considered to have a retail concept. The 
Department continues to issue full-time student subminimum wage certificates to 
such employers under FLSA section 14(b) because of their retail character. In 
addition, such youth have been permitted to be employed, and have been safely 
employed, as janitors at many retail and food service establishments over the 
years, including department stores, hotels, amusement parks, restaurants, and 
large discount stores. It is important to note that the CLC is incorrect in its 
assumption that this proposal would permit the employment of 14- and 
15-year-olds by messenger service firms that ``have standing contracts with law 
firms, accounting firms, and other types of businesses'' to deliver documents 
or small packages. The Department has opined, as early as 1989, that the term 
public messenger service involves that delivery service rendered to a company 
which takes messages, small parcels, etc. from one party for delivery to 
another party. The public messenger goes between two parties, neither of whom 
is necessarily known to the messenger. The term public in this context refers 
to the customers being served and not the nature of the ownership of the firm. 
Accordingly, a 16-year minimum age is required for employment in such messenger 
services. The CLC is correct in its interpretation that 14- and 15-year-olds 
are permitted under Sec. 570.34(a)(4) (old) and Sec. 570.34(g) (new) to perform 
errand and delivery work by foot, bicycle, and public transportation for their 
employers when their employers are not engaged in the business of providing 
messenger services to others. The Department agrees with the CLC that the 
adoption of this proposal will allow 14- and 15-year-olds to be employed to 
perform office work for such employers as accounting firms, advertising 
agencies, and insurance companies; and that such youth could, under the proper 
circumstances, work as many as eight hours in a day and forty hours in a week 
when school is not in session. The Department, however, does not agree that 
such an expansion of positive youth opportunities is improper or in any way 
fails to comport with the requirements and spirit of FLSA section 3(l). Office 
work continues to be one of the safest occupations available to young workers. 
Moreover, this rule does not change the limitations on the number of hours per 
day or per week that 14- and 15-year-olds may work when school is not in 
session. [[Page 28416]] The Department also proposed to revise Sec. 
570.34(a)(8) (old) by clarifying that 14- and 15-year-olds may perform car 
cleaning, washing, and polishing, but only by hand (see Sec. 570.34(n) (new)). 
Such youth are prohibited from operating or tending any power-driven machinery, 
other than office equipment, and this prohibition has always included automatic 
car washers, power-washers, and power-driven scrubbers and buffers. The 
Department believes this clarification will provide guidance to employers. The 
Department received three comments on this proposal. The YWN supported the 
proposal as written. The CLC supported this proposal but again expressed 
concern based on its erroneous assumption that such youth could be employed to 
paint automobiles. The National Automobile Dealers Association (NADA) took 
``strong exception to this `clarification' '' (emphasis in original). NADA 
stated that vehicle washing ``anecdotally is known as the classic entry-level 
dealership employment activity * * * Vehicle cleaning, washing, and polishing 
activities commonly involve small portable power-washers and hand-tool 
buffers'' (emphasis in the original). NADA stated that nowhere in the 
regulatory history of Sec. 570.34(a)(8) or in the NIOSH Report has any 
suggestion been made that power-equipment-assisted motor vehicle cleaning, 
washing, and polishing activities pose ``significant safety or health risks to 
14- and 15-year-olds.'' NADA also recommended that the word car in Sec. 
570.34(a)(8) (old) be replaced with the words motor vehicles so such youth may 
be permitted to wash additional types of motor vehicles such as SUVs, station 
wagons, and vans. The Department has considered the comments and has decided to 
adopt the proposal as written. The Department believes this revision to be 
nothing more than a clarification of its long-standing interpretation of the 
regulations. Contrary to NADA's statement, Reg. 3, of which Sec. 570.34(a)(8) 
is a part, has clearly stated in Sec. 570.33(b) for many years that 14- and 
15-year-olds may not be employed in ``occupations which involve the operation 
or tending of hoisting apparatus or of any power-driven machinery other than 
office machines'' (emphasis added). If employers have allowed FLSA covered and 
nonexempt 14- and 15-year-olds to wash or polish cars and trucks using power- 
driven washers or hand-tool buffers, they have done so in violation of the 
federal child labor provisions. The NIOSH Report did not mention the provisions 
of Sec. 570.34(a)(8) because the Report dealt exclusively with HOs, which 
address work that is particularly hazardous or detrimental to the health and 
well-being of 16- and 17-year-old minors. Even if NADA had presented data 
supporting its statement that power-equipment-assisted motor vehicle washing 
and polishing poses ``no significant safety or health risks to 14- and 
15-year-olds,'' the Department notes that such a standard is considerably more 
lax than the FLSA section 3(l) standard the Secretary must apply when 
determining permissible employment opportunities for such youth. Finally, the 
Department does not accept NADA's recommendation to expand Sec. 570.34(a)(8) 
(old) to include all motor vehicles. The Department has long interpreted the 
term cars and trucks as used in Sec. 570.34(a)(8) to include station wagons, 
SUVs, and passenger vans. The term does not include larger vehicles such as 
buses, tractor-trailers, and heavy- construction equipment--all of which would 
generally be considered motor vehicles under Reg. 3 and HO 2. The additional 
occupations the Department proposed to permit 14- and 15-year-olds to perform 
are discussed below: 1. Work of a Mental or Artistically Creative Nature The 
Department has routinely received inquiries asking whether 14- and 15-year-old 
youth may be employed to perform certain mental or artistically creative 
activities in industries not specifically permitted by Reg. 3. The inquiries 
have concerned such jobs as a computer programmer and computer applications 
demonstrator for a college, print and runway model, and musical director at a 
church or school. Often, these inquiries involved students who are especially 
gifted or career oriented in a particular field. A strict adherence to Reg. 3 
requirements would not permit the employment of a 14- or 15- year-old in any of 
these scenarios, even though talented and motivated youth could safely and 
successfully perform these tasks without interfering with their schooling or 
health and well-being. The Department proposed to revise Reg. 3 at Sec. 
570.34(b) (new) to permit the employment of 14- and 15-year-olds to perform 
work of a mental or artistically creative nature, such as computer programming, 
the writing of software, teaching or performing as a tutor, serving as a peer 
counselor or teacher's assistant, singing, playing a musical instrument, and 
drawing. Permitted work of a mental nature would be limited to work that is 
similar to that performed in an office setting and not involving the use of any 
power-driven equipment other than office machines. Artistically creative work 
would be limited to work in a recognized field of artistic or creative 
endeavor. The employment would be permitted in any industry other than those 
prohibited by Reg. 3 and would also be subject to all the applicable hours and 
times standards established in Sec. 570.35 and the prohibited occupation 
standards contained in Sec. 570.33. The Department received comments from the 
YWN and CLC on this proposal. Both commenters supported the proposal, but made 
additional recommendations. The YWN suggested that the Department replace the 
word mental with intellectual, so that the phrase in the subsection would read 
``work of an intellectual or artistically creative nature.'' The YWN 
recommended that, for work of an artistic nature, certain locations such as 
tattoo and body piercing establishments should be excluded due to the potential 
for exposure to bloodborne pathogens. The YWN also stated that the proposal 
should prohibit youth employed in artistic endeavors from performing work that 
would expose them to carcinogenic, toxic, or hazardous substances, or to high 
heat. ``For example, 14- and 15-year-olds would be permitted to work on a 
pottery wheel, but would be prohibited from applying certain glazes and would 
be prohibited from any work on or around the high heats of a pottery kiln. 
Another example would be that 14- and 15-year-olds would be permitted to 
sculpt, but would be prohibited from welding and soldering or any functions 
that expose them to heat, or to height or other existing restrictions.'' 
Finally, the YWN believed that some artistically creative work may ``push the 
envelope on exploitative labor and/or prove detrimental to the morals of 
youth.'' The CLC also supported this proposal with additional comments and 
recommendations. The CLC noted that although the proposed Sec. 570.34(b) 
contains the statement that artistically creative work is limited to work in a 
recognized field of artistic or creative endeavor, it does not define the term 
artistic or creative endeavor. The CLC correctly stated that another of the 
Department's regulations, 29 CFR 541.302(b), advises this term includes such 
fields as music, writing, acting, and the graphic arts. The CLC also expressed 
concerns that singing and the playing of musical instruments are often in 
demand ``in bars, lounges, cabarets, and other places that 14- and 15-year-olds 
might best avoid. These and other settings could cause untoward effects on 
[[Page 28417]] such youngsters' moral health, even if not on their physical 
health and safety.'' The Department has carefully considered the comments and 
has decided to adopt the proposal with one modification. The Department agrees 
with the YWN that the word intellectual better comports with the intent of this 
proposal than the word mental. Accordingly, the Department is revising the 
proposed Sec. 570.34(b) to reflect this suggested change. The Department 
understands the concerns of both commenters as to the types of tasks young 
workers would be permitted to perform under the umbrella of ``artistic or 
creative endeavors'' and notes that it will rely on 29 CFR 541.302(b)--which 
limits the scope of this term to such fields as music, writing, acting, and the 
graphic arts--for guidance. The Department wishes to address concerns raised by 
the YWN by stating that it does not consider tattooing or body piercing 
performed by employees under the age of 16 years to be artistically creative 
endeavors under Sec. 541.302(b). The Department also notes that 14- and 
15-year-olds who are employed in artistic or creative endeavors will continue 
to be prohibited from performing any of the occupations or tasks detailed in 
the revised Sec. 570.33. These prohibitions, which include work in 
manufacturing and processing occupations, the operation of most power- driven 
equipment, and any duties in work rooms or work places where goods are 
manufactured or processed, should alleviate many of the concerns raised by the 
YWN and CLC. These prohibitions would prevent a 14- or 15-year-old from working 
in a factory or workroom as a ``molder'' or ``hand painter'' producing mass 
quantities of nearly identical pottery or ceramic items, but when coupled with 
this Final Rule, they would permit the youth to express his or her artistic 
talents to shape by hand a unique clay pot or sculpt a piece of art. Likewise, 
a 14- or 15-year-old could be employed, with all the safeguards of Sec. Sec. 
570.33-.35, as a painter of portraits but not as a painter of automobiles or 
houses. Similarly, a youth could be employed to create unique photographs that 
rise to the level of art, but would be prohibited from developing those 
photographs and working with the chemicals and solvents commonly used in such 
processing activities. In addition, the hours standards provisions of Sec. 
570.35 restrict the number of hours and times of day that 14- and 15-year-olds 
may be employed in any FLSA-covered work, including artistic or creative 
endeavors. Finally, the Department appreciates the concerns of both the YWN and 
CLC that under the guise of ``artistic or creative endeavors'' some employers 
have attempted to employ youth in unsafe or unsavory lines of work that, as the 
commenters note, jeopardize the morals of the young workers. For example, the 
Department has encountered a situation involving the employment of very young 
females as ``taxi-dancers'' who were recruited and paid by bars and nightclubs 
to dance with male patrons, often late into the evening. The Department was 
able to quickly put an end to this unacceptable employment by not only 
enforcing the child labor and minimum wage provisions of the FLSA, but by 
partnering with local law enforcement authorities to ensure that city and state 
laws addressing community standards were enforced. The Department believes that 
the strict enforcement of such ordinances by the appropriate authorities will 
continue to be important supplements to the effectiveness of the federal child 
labor laws. 2. The Employment of 15-Year-Olds (But Not 14-Year-Olds) as 
Lifeguards The Department proposed to revise Reg. 3 at Sec. 570.34(l) to permit 
the employment of 15-year-olds as lifeguards at swimming pools and water 
amusement parks under certain conditions. A local chapter of the American Red 
Cross (Chapter) first raised this issue in 2000. The Chapter advised the 
Department that the Red Cross had revised its own rules and had begun 
certifying 15-year-olds as lifeguards. Prior to 2000, according to the Chapter, 
16 years was generally the minimum age at which the Red Cross would provide 
such certification. The Chapter inquired as to whether Reg. 3 would permit the 
employment of 15-year- olds as lifeguards. Also in 2000, a municipality 
contacted the Department inquiring whether it could legally employ such youth 
as lifeguards at its city-owned swimming pools. The occupation of lifeguard is 
not specifically authorized in Reg. 3 as an occupation that 14- and 
15-year-olds may perform. In response to the inquiries, the Department adopted 
an enforcement policy in 2000 that allowed 15-year-olds (but not 14-year-olds) 
to be employed at swimming pools owned and operated by state and local 
governments or private-sector retail establishments under certain conditions. 
Those conditions included that the youth be trained and certified in aquatics 
and water safety by the Red Cross or by some similarly recognized certifying 
organization, and that the youth work under conditions acceptable to the Red 
Cross or some similarly recognized certifying organization. This enforcement 
position permitted such employment at swimming pools operated by hotels, 
amusement parks, cities, and state- owned universities, but did not permit such 
employment at pools operated by non-public and non-retail establishments such 
as apartment houses, country clubs, private schools, home-owner associations, 
and private health clubs. In early 2005, the Department, after reviewing 
additional information, extended this enforcement position to permit the 
employment of 15-year-olds as lifeguards at all traditional swimming pools 
regardless of who owns, operates or manages the establishments, and at those 
facilities of water amusement parks that constitute traditional swimming pools. 
The Department proposed to revise Reg. 3 by creating Sec. 570.34(l) to 
incorporate portions of the current enforcement position. The revision would 
permit 15-year-olds, but not 14-year-olds, to be employed as lifeguards, 
performing lifeguard duties, at traditional swimming pools and certain areas of 
amusement water parks operated by all types of employers, if the minors have 
been trained and certified by the Red Cross or a similarly recognized 
certifying organization. The occupation of lifeguard, as used in this subpart, 
entails the duties of rescuing swimmers in danger of drowning, the monitoring 
of activities at a swimming pool to prevent accidents, the teaching of water 
safety, and assisting patrons. Lifeguards may also help to maintain order and 
cleanliness in the pool and pool areas, give swimming instructions, conduct or 
officiate at swimming meets, and administer first aid. Additional ancillary 
lifeguard duties may include checking in and out such items as towels, rings, 
watches and apparel. Permitted duties for 15-year-olds would include the use of 
a ladder to access and descend from the lifeguard chair; the use of hand tools 
to clean the pool and pool area; and the testing and recording of water quality 
for temperature and/or pH levels, using all of the tools of the testing process 
including adding chemicals to the test water sample. Fifteen-year-olds employed 
as lifeguards would, however, be prohibited from entering or working in any 
mechanical rooms or chemical storage areas, including any areas where the 
filtration and chlorinating systems are housed. The other provisions of Reg. 3, 
including the restrictions on hours of work contained at Sec. 570.35(a), would 
[[Page 28418]] continue to apply to the employment of 15-year-old lifeguards. 
Under the proposed rule, no youth under 15 years of age, whether properly 
certified or not, could legally perform any portion of the lifeguard duties 
detailed above as part of his or her FLSA covered employment. The core and 
defining duty of a lifeguard is the rescuing of swimmers in danger of drowning, 
often by entering the water and physically bringing the swimmer to safety. 
Under the Department's proposal, any employee under the age of 16 whose duties 
include this core duty--such as a ``junior lifeguard'' or a ``swim-teacher 
aide''-- or whose employment could place him or her in a situation where the 
employer would reasonably expect him or her to perform such rescue duties, 
would be performing the duties of a lifeguard while working in such a position. 
For such employment to comply with Reg. 3, the employee would have to be at 
least 15 years of age and be properly certified. A traditional swimming pool, 
as used in this subpart, would mean a water-tight structure of concrete, 
masonry, or other approved materials located either indoors or outdoors, used 
for bathing or swimming and filled with a filtered and disinfected water 
supply, together with buildings, appurtenances and equipment used in connection 
therewith. A water amusement park means an establishment that not only 
encompasses the features of a traditional swimming pool, but may also include 
such additional attractions as wave pools; lazy rivers; specialized activities 
areas such as baby pools, water falls, and sprinklers; and elevated water 
slides. Properly certified 15-year-olds would be permitted to be employed as 
lifeguards at most of these water park features. Not included in the definition 
of a traditional swimming pool or a water amusement park would be such natural 
environment swimming facilities as rivers, streams, lakes, reservoirs, wharfs, 
piers, canals, or oceanside beaches. It is important to note that Sec. 
570.33(b) (old) prohibits the employment of 14- and 15-year-olds in occupations 
involving the operation or tending of power-driven machinery, except office 
machines. This prohibition has always encompassed the operation or tending of 
all power-driven amusement park and recreation establishment rides-- including 
elevated slides found at water amusement parks. Such slides, which often reach 
heights of over 40 feet, rely on power-driven machinery that pump water to the 
top of the slides which facilitates the descents of the riders to the 
``splash-down'' areas at the base of the slides. Minors less than 16 years of 
age may not be employed as dispatchers or attendants at the top of elevated 
water slides-- employees who maintain order, direct patrons as to when to 
depart the top of the slide, and ensure that patrons have safely begun their 
ride--because such work constitutes ``tending'' as used in Reg. 3. In addition, 
when serving as dispatchers or attendants at the top of an elevated water 
slide, minors under 16 years of age are not performing, nor can they reasonably 
be expected to perform, the core lifeguard duty of rescuing swimmers because 
they are so far removed from the splash- down area of the slide. Accordingly, 
even if 15-year-old minors have been certified as lifeguards, the provisions of 
Sec. 570.34(l) would not apply to the time spent as dispatchers or attendants 
at an elevated water slide. Properly certified 15-year-old lifeguards, however, 
may be stationed at the ``splashdown pools'' located at the bottom of the 
elevated water slides to perform traditional lifeguard duties. The Department 
is aware that permitting 15-year-olds to be employed as lifeguards at such 
water amusement park facilities as lazy rivers, wave pools, and the splashdown 
pools of elevated slides could be construed as allowing these youth to tend 
power-driven machinery. But the Department believes that the overall 
predominance of their responsibility to perform the core life-saving duty of 
rescuing patrons who are in the water, which they have been properly trained 
and certified to perform, outweighs the minimum, isolated, and sporadic amount 
of tending such lifeguards may potentially be called upon to do when stationed 
at wave pools, lazy rivers, and splashdown pools. The Department received 
eleven comments in response to this proposal. This includes three comments that 
were submitted as attachments to the comments of the International Association 
of Amusement Parks and Attractions (IAAPA). The comments centered around the 
following elements of the proposal: (1) Whether 15 should be the minimum age 
for employment as a lifeguard at a traditional swimming pool or water amusement 
park; (2) whether 16 should be the minimum age for employment as a lifeguard at 
natural environments such as lakes, rivers, and oceanside beaches; and (3) 
whether 15-year-olds should be prohibited from being employed as dispatchers or 
attendants at the top of elevated water slides. Some of the commenters 
supported the entire proposal as written or suggested only minor modifications. 
The IAAPA, which describes itself as the largest international trade 
association for permanently-situated amusement facilities worldwide, supported 
this proposal. The proposal was supported by the General Manager of Shipwreck 
Island Waterpark of Panama Beach City, Florida, whose comments were submitted 
by the IAAPA. A representative of Six Flags, Inc. also supported the proposal 
and stated that ``[w]hile we still believe that 15-year-olds could safely work 
as dispatchers on elevated water elements, we find the proposed changes to be 
an acceptable compromise.'' The National Recreation and Park Association 
(NRPA), which described itself as ``a non-profit organization seeking to 
enhance public park facilities and expand recreation opportunities,'' supported 
the adoption of the proposed change in regulations that would revise Reg. 3 in 
order to ``conditionally allow'' 15-year-olds to be employed at traditional 
swimming pools and water parks. The NRPA also supported establishing a minimum 
age of 16 for the employment of lifeguards at natural environments. In 
addition, the NRPA commented that ``[l]ocal park and recreation agencies have a 
great need to find qualified, capable, and certified lifeguards to work in 
their outdoor pools, indoor pools, water amusement park facilities, and natural 
bodies of water. In proposing these regulations, the Department will help 
agencies meet their needs to hire certified lifeguards by allowing lifeguards 
to begin work at the age of 15. Expanding the eligible age for employment as a 
lifeguard at traditional swimming pools could help these communities enhance 
pool safety by providing a wider and larger applicant pool from which to select 
qualified candidates, and by increasing lifeguard availability, make shorter 
shifts an increasingly real probability.'' The American Red Cross (Red Cross), 
which has been developing and implementing lifeguard training and certification 
programs since 1914, stated that it is ``comfortable'' with the Department's 
proposal with one small change. The Red Cross objected to the Department 
including the task of ``giving swimming instructions'' in the list of duties 
that 15-year-olds may perform because the Red Cross lifeguard training course 
does not include training on how to give swimming instructions. Such training 
is available to 15-year-olds via a separate Red Cross Water Safety Instructor 
(WSI) course. The Red Cross recommended that the Department [[Page 28419]] 
alleviate possible public misunderstanding by deleting ``giving swimming 
instructions'' from the list of permitted lifeguard duties. The United States 
Lifesaving Association (USLA), which described itself as America's nonprofit, 
professional association of beach lifeguards and open water rescuers, reported 
that it ``works to reduce the incidence of death and injury in the aquatic 
environment through public education, promulgation of national lifeguard 
standards, training programs, promotion of high levels of lifeguard readiness, 
and other means.'' The USLA commented that, since 1980, it has maintained the 
position that lifeguards serving at natural environments, whether surf or 
non-surf beaches, should be at least 16 years of age. The USLA further 
commented that this position was also reached by participants at a national 
conference held in 1980 which issued a report entitled ``Guidelines for 
Establishing Open-Water Recreational Beach Standards.'' Participants included 
representatives of the American Camping Association, Red Cross, National Safety 
Council, YMCA of the USA, Council for National Cooperation in Aquatics, Centers 
for Disease Control and Prevention, U.S. Coast Guard, Boy Scouts of America, 
the National Park Service, several major municipal lifeguard agencies from 
throughout the USA, and several medical experts. The USLA noted that the 
participants at this conference, which used a consensus-based process to issue 
its recommendations, considered such factors as the physical and cultural 
parameters of the natural environments to be guarded; the psychological and 
physiological stresses of public safety employment; the lack of physical 
stamina, maturity, and experience of those under 16 years of age; and the 
varying levels of supervision provided young lifeguards. The USLA summarized 
its comments by stating ``people under the age of 16 should not be permitted to 
work as lifeguards at natural environments.'' It also commented that it found 
it difficult to construct reasons that differentiate the natural environment 
from the pool environment, given that many of the reasons for establishing a 
minimum age of 16 years for employment as a lifeguard at a natural environment 
facility are equally applicable at traditional pools. The YWN and the CLC 
opposed this proposal and both, apparently, support the comments submitted by 
the USLA, although this is not clear. The YWN referred to comments of the US 
Lifeguarding Association and the CLC referred to comments of the Lifeguard 
Standards Association. The Department has not been contacted by any 
organizations using those names in regards to this proposal. The YWN also 
stated that work as a lifeguard may entail exposure to combative individuals, 
bloodborne pathogens, and chemicals. It added that, for these reasons, other 
organizations like the YMCA do not certify lifeguards until age 16 and thus 
``DOL's argument that this proposal ties DOL enforcement practice to 
`standards' in the industry is not accurate.'' The YWN also questioned the 
justification for adding a new and unique age cut-off for this one particular 
job, when all other regulations group 15-year-olds with 14-year-olds. The CLC 
stated that ``most distressing is the fact that DOL gives no indication of what 
the Red Cross training requires.'' It also commented that the fact that DOL 
would require the lifeguards to be certified by the Red Cross (or a similar 
certifying organization) in aquatics and water safety ``in no way assures that 
the DOL proposal is prudent.'' The World Waterpark Association (WWA) supported 
the proposal to permit the employment of 15-year-olds as lifeguards at 
traditional swimming pools and water amusement parks, but opposed that portion 
of the proposal that would prohibit such youth from working as dispatchers or 
attendants at the top of elevated water slides. The WWA opined that ``[it] is a 
universally accepted position of the aquatic community that a lifeguard's first 
responsibility is to prevent accidents and injuries by enforcing rules and 
educating patrons * * *. Therefore, 15-year-olds working at the tops of 
waterslides are fulfilling one of the core duties of properly trained 
lifeguards, in a manner which places them at the least possible risk.'' The WWA 
also disagreed with the Department's position that working as a dispatcher or 
attendant at the top of an elevated water slide constitutes tending of 
power-driven machinery under the provisions of Reg. 3 where there are no 
mechanized conveyance systems or emergency ride controls at the top. A 
representative of Morey's Pier of Wildwood, New Jersey, whose comments were 
submitted by the IAAPA, supported the proposal to allow the employment of 
15-year-olds as lifeguards at traditional swimming pools and water amusement 
parks. She also addressed the position of water slide dispatcher, stating ``we 
see no reason or evidence that this is a dangerous job that should be 
restricted.'' She also opined that such dispatchers are not in contact with any 
power-driven machinery. A representative of the Pleasant Hill Recreation and 
Park District (Pleasant Hill) of Pleasant Hill, California, expressed concern 
about how this proposal would affect youth who volunteer in her District's 
``junior lifeguard program.'' After reviewing the list of permitted lifeguard 
duties presented in Sec. 570.34(l)(2), she noted that her facility has ``swim 
instructors who are certified by the American Red Cross as Water Safety 
Instructors, but are not lifeguard certified.'' Her facility has ``cashiers who 
are not lifeguard certified, but who help maintain order/cleanliness in the 
pool area (deck, locker rooms, crowd control during emergency, etc.). She 
questioned whether such employees, who are not employed as lifeguards, must be 
at least 16 years of age or be 15 years of age with proper lifeguard 
certification. The representative of Pleasant Hill also noted that youth aged 
11 to 14 years of age participate in her facility's junior lifeguard program. 
The participants attend 8 hours of training, which follows the Red Cross's 
Guard Start Program, and then volunteer at the pool as aides during swim 
lessons. Participating youths are assigned to assist an instructor, are never 
left alone to teach a class, and also help during recreational swims ``by 
checking in/out patrons bags/apparel/ belongings.'' She noted that the junior 
lifeguard program is an important tool for recruiting and developing future 
lifeguards. The Department has carefully considered all the comments and has 
decided to adopt the proposal as written, with two modifications. The 
Department appreciates the concerns raised by the Red Cross that certified 
lifeguards may not have received the proper training, and therefore the proper 
certification, to give swimming instruction. This same issue was mentioned by 
Pleasant Hill, which noted that it had swimming instructors who were properly 
certified by the Red Cross but were not certified as lifeguards. In order to 
address the concerns of the Red Cross, ensure the maximum possible safety for 
young workers and their charges who are learning to swim, and eliminate 
confusion, the Department is modifying the language in the proposed Sec. 
570.34(l)(2) to reflect that 15-year-olds may be employed as swimming 
instructors only when they have been certified to perform both lifeguard and 
swimming instruction by the Red Cross or some other recognized certifying 
organization. This requirement for dual certification, like the other lifeguard 
[[Page 28420]] requirements contained in Reg. 3, will end when the minor 
reaches his or her 16th birthday. The Department received an inquiry after the 
publication of the NPRM asking why ponds and quarries, places where swimming 
often occurs, were not specifically listed as natural environment swimming 
facilities in Sec. 570.34(l)(2) where the term traditional swimming pool is 
defined. In order to clarify the Final Rule, the Department has decided to add 
ponds and quarries to the non-exhaustive list of examples of natural 
environment swimming facilities that currently includes rivers, streams, lakes, 
reservoirs, wharfs, piers, canals, and oceanside beaches. The Department 
appreciates the concerns of the YWN, CLC, and USLA about lowering the 
employment age for lifeguards at traditional swimming pools and certain water 
amusement park facilities to 15, but believes that such safeguards as proper 
certification in aquatics and water safety by a recognized certification 
organization, the prohibition against tending power-driven machinery which 
prevents 15- year-olds from working as dispatchers or attendants at the top of 
elevated water slides, the OSHA standards addressing potential exposures to 
bloodborne pathogens and chemicals, and the hours and times of day standards 
established by Sec. 570.35 combine to provide adequate protections to these 
young workers. The Department does not share the YWN's concerns about adding 
``a new and unique age cut-off for this one particular job, when all other 
regulations group 15-year- olds with 14-year-olds.'' The Department notes that 
when rules are clearly written and adequately explained, public understanding 
and compliance follow. This was evidenced by the revisions to HO 2 published on 
December 16, 2004 (see 69 FR 75382, see also Sec. 570.52(b)) necessitated by 
the enactment of FLSA section 13(c)(6), which permits limited on-the-job 
driving by 17-year-olds under certain conditions, but not by 16-year-olds. The 
Department does not agree with the CLC's comment that the DOL gives no 
indication of what Red Cross training requires and the YWN's comment that this 
proposal is not ``tied to standards in the industry.'' The Red Cross, just like 
other nationally recognized certifying organizations, spends a great deal of 
time and effort formulating, refining, disseminating, and publicizing the 
elements and standards of its lifeguard certification program. It is difficult 
to argue that the Red Cross is not the ``industry standard'' when it estimates 
that about 90% of all lifeguards in the USA have received training through its 
lifeguard training program. The Department appreciates the concerns of certain 
commenters that 15-year-olds should be permitted to be employed as dispatchers 
or attendants at the top of elevated water slides, but believes that 
continuation of its long-held position that such employment constitutes the 
prohibited tending of power-driven equipment--just as it is for attendants on 
roller coasters, merry-go-rounds, and ski-lifts--is both prudent and proper. 
Finally, the Department acknowledges the concerns of Pleasant Hill which raised 
the issue of ``junior lifeguard programs'' and the ``volunteer'' participation 
of youths between the ages of 11 and 14 in such endeavors. The Department notes 
that when such programs do not involve an employer-employee relationship, they 
fall outside the provisions of the FLSA. But when it is determined that an 
employer- employee relationship does exist, and the employee is engaged in work 
that is subject to the FLSA, the minimum age for such employment at a 
traditional swimming pool would be 14. Such 14-year-old employees could not be 
employed as lifeguards or swim instructors, but could perform such tasks as 
maintaining the cleanliness of the pool area and locker rooms, signing in and 
signing out patrons, and checking in and out such items as towels, watches, and 
apparel. Such youth would not be permitted to perform any of the core functions 
of a lifeguard nor be employed in a situation where their employers could 
reasonably expect them to rescue swimmers in danger of drowning. Under this 
Final Rule, properly certified 15-year-olds could be employed at such pools as 
lifeguards. 3. The Employment of Certain Youth by Places of Business Where 
Machinery Is Used To Process Wood Products The provisions of the Consolidated 
Appropriations Act, 2004, amended the FLSA by creating a limited exemption from 
the child labor provisions for certain minors 14 through 17 years of age who 
are excused from compulsory school attendance beyond the eighth grade. The 
exemption, contained at section 13(c)(7) of the FLSA, allows eligible youth to 
work inside and outside of places of businesses that use machinery to process 
wood products, subject to specified limitations. The Department is 
incorporating the new requirements of this amendment into its regulations. The 
Department proposed to incorporate the amendment into Reg. 3 at Sec. 570.34(m), 
and into Sec. 570.54, Logging occupations and occupations in the operation of 
any sawmill, lath mill, shingle mill, or cooperage stock mill (Order 4). 
Section 13(c)(7) overrides the heretofore complete prohibition on the 
employment of 14- and 15-year-olds in manufacturing occupations contained in 
section 3(l) of the FLSA. Accordingly, to meet the requirements of this 
legislation, the Department proposed to revise Reg. 3 to permit the employment 
of qualifying 14- and 15-year-olds inside and outside of places of business 
where manufacturing (the processing of wood products by machinery) takes place, 
subject to specified conditions and limitations. The Department proposed to 
limit the types of employers that may employ such minors, as well as the 
worksites at which such minors may be employed, to those contemplated by the 
language of the statute and mentioned by the sponsors of the legislation and 
the interested parties that testified at the hearings held by Congress prior to 
the enactment of the legislation (see, e.g., Testimony Before Senate Labor, 
Health and Human Services, and Education Subcommittee of the Committee on 
Appropriations, The Employment Needs of Amish Youth, 107th Cong. 2 (2001)). The 
term places of business where machinery is used to process wood products shall 
mean such permanent workplaces as sawmills, lath mills, shingle mills, 
cooperage stock mills, furniture and cabinet making shops, gazebo and shed 
making shops, toy manufacturing shops, and pallet shops. The term shall not 
include construction sites, portable sawmills, areas where logging is being 
performed, or mining operations. The term inside or outside places of business 
refers to the distinct physical place of the business, i.e., the buildings and 
the immediate grounds necessary for the operation of the business. This 
exemption would not apply to tasks performed at locations other than inside or 
outside the place of business of the employer such as the delivery of items to 
customers or the installation of items at customers' establishments or 
residences. Although section 13(c)(7) permits the employment of certain youth 
inside and outside of places of business where machinery is used to process 
wood products, it does so only if the youth do not operate or assist in the 
operation of power-driven woodworking machines. The occupations of operating or 
assisting in the operation of and the term power-driven woodworking machines 
are well-established in the regulations, including in Sec. 570.55. The 
Department proposed to revise Reg. 3 to [[Page 28421]] include definitions of 
these terms along with the specific prohibition against operating or assisting 
in the operation of power-driven woodworking machines. Section 570.55 lists, 
when discussing the prohibited occupations involved in the operation of 
power-driven woodworking machines, such activities as supervising or 
controlling the operation of the machines, feeding materials into such 
machines, and helping the operator feed material into such machines. The list 
also includes the occupations of setting up, adjusting, repairing, oiling, or 
cleaning the machines. That same section defines power-driven woodworking 
machines to mean all fixed or portable machines or tools driven by power and 
used or designed for cutting, shaping, forming, surfacing, nailing, stapling, 
wire stitching, fastening, or otherwise assembling, pressing, or printing wood 
or veneer. The Department proposed to amend the definition of power-driven 
woodworking machines to include those machines that process trees, logs, and 
lumber in recognition that section 13(c)(7) now permits certain youth 14 
through 17 years of age to work in such places of business as sawmills, lath 
mills, and shingle mills where trees, logs, and lumber would be processed. 
Expanding this definition thus clarifies that youth are prohibited from 
operating or assisting in the operation of wood- processing machinery typically 
found in the workplaces covered by the 2004 amendment. This revised definition 
of power-driven woodworking machines would be included in Sec. 570.34(m) of 
Reg. 3 and both Sec. 570.54 (HO 4) and Sec. 570.55 (HO 5). The limited 
exemption contained in section 13(c)(7) applies only to certain youth--new 
entrants into the workforce--and only when certain additional criteria are met. 
Section 13(c)(7) defines a new entrant into the workforce as an individual who 
is under the age of 18 and at least the age of 14, and, by statute or judicial 
order, is exempt from compulsory school attendance beyond the eighth grade. In 
addition, in order to be employed inside or outside of places of business where 
machinery is used to process wood products, the new entrant must be supervised 
by an adult relative or an adult member of the same religious sect or division 
as the entrant. The term supervised refers to the requirement that the youth's 
on-the-job activities be directed, monitored, overseen, and controlled by a 
specified named adult. Although the statute does not define the terms adult and 
relative, the Department proposed that, for purpose of this exemption, a 
relative would include a parent (or person standing in place of a parent), a 
grandparent, an aunt, an uncle, and a sibling; and an adult would be someone 
who has reached his or her eighteenth birthday. The Department also proposed 
that the term adult member of the same religious sect or division as the youth 
would mean an adult who professes membership in the same religious sect or 
division to which the youth professes membership. The Department believes that 
in order to ensure these youth receive the degree of protection from injury 
Congress intended, the supervision of the minors must be close, direct, and 
uninterrupted. It is important to note that this requirement of close, direct, 
and uninterrupted supervision, just like the requirement that youth not operate 
or assist in the operation of power-driven woodworking machinery, applies to 
the employment of 16- and 17-year- olds as well as 14- and 15-year-olds. 
Furthermore, section 13(c)(7) permits the employment of a new entrant inside or 
outside places of business where machinery is used to process wood products 
only if the youth is protected from wood particles or other flying debris 
within the workplace by a barrier appropriate to the potential hazard of such 
wood particles or flying debris or by maintaining a sufficient distance from 
machinery in operation, and is required to use personal protective equipment to 
prevent exposure to excessive levels of noise and saw dust. It is the 
Department's position that section 13(c)(7)'s prerequisite that the youth is 
``required to use personal protective equipment to prevent exposure to 
excessive levels of noise and saw dust'' includes the youth's actual use of 
such equipment and not just the employer's obligation to mandate such use. The 
Wage and Hour Division has consulted with representatives of the Department's 
Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and will defer to that 
agency's expertise and guidance when determining whether an employer is in 
compliance with the safety provisions of this exemption--i.e., whether a 
workplace barrier is appropriate to the potential hazard, whether a sufficient 
distance has been maintained from machinery in operation, and whether the youth 
is exposed to excessive levels of noise and saw dust. The Department proposed 
that compliance with the safety and health provisions discussed in the previous 
paragraph will be accomplished when the employer is in compliance with the 
requirements of the applicable governing standards issued by OSHA or, in those 
areas where OSHA has authorized the state to operate its own Occupational 
Safety and Health Plan, the applicable standards issued by the Office charged 
with administering the State Occupational Safety and Health Plan. The 
Department received three comments on this proposal. Although both the YWN and 
CLC stated that they did not support enactment of FLSA section 13(c)(7), they 
strongly supported the Department's efforts to ensure that the regulations 
provide adequate protections for youths who are now permitted to be employed 
inside and outside places of business where machinery is used to process wood 
products. Both of these commenters, along with the AFL-CIO, made additional 
recommendations to the proposal. Both the YWN and the AFL-CIO recommended that 
the Department add a requirement to the revised Sec. 570.34(m)(1) that all 
youth who come within the exemption provided by FLSA section 13(c)(7) must 
receive safety training or certification for the specific activities allowed 
under the proposal. The CLC labeled as a ``wise approach'' the Department's 
proposal to rely on the expertise of OSHA, or the Office charged with 
administering an OSHA-authorized state plan where appropriate, to determine if 
employers are complying with certain of the safety standards established by 
FLSA section 13(c)(7). As an outgrowth of this proposal, it stated that ``it 
would make sense either for the Wage and Hour Division to enforce OSHA in this 
context by issuing OSHA citations that assert OSHA violations, or for the Wage 
and Hour Division investigator to notify OSHA of an OSHA violation and direct 
OSHA to investigate the matter as well for OSHA violations. The reason for this 
recommendation that the CLC makes here is that if there are OSHA violations 
that give rise to child labor violations, then the adults who work with the 
woodworking machinery are subject to the same workplace hazards as the 
children.'' The CLC commented that the Department's proposal that the 
supervision received by young workers employed under the provisions of FLSA 
section 13(c)(7) be close, direct, constant, and uninterrupted is essential in 
view of the serious hazards that such youth will face. The CLC recommended that 
the proposal should also require that the supervision be ``one-on-one'' and 
that the supervisors of the young workers should be required to have experience 
within the wood processing industry or that workplace. The CLC also expressed 
concern that neither the statute nor the proposal [[Page 28422]] addresses the 
potential exposure of young workers to ``the toxic chemicals present in 
adhesives and coating agents that are used in woodworking operations.'' The CLC 
noted that many of these chemicals pose risks of both short-term and long-term 
effects on the human body and also are extremely flammable, and hence pose 
significant fire and explosion hazards. CLC stated ``DOL's OSHA experts are 
familiar with these hazards.'' Finally, the CLC noted that the statute did not 
require woodworking establishments that employ youth under the provisions of 
FLSA section 13(c)(7) to report all work-related accidents and deaths of such 
workers to the Department. The CLC stated that even in the absence of such a 
reporting requirement, the Department can play an important role by publicizing 
not only the hazards of working in such places of business, but also the 
results of any child labor investigations involving woodworking machines. The 
CLC believed that such publicizing will remind all American youth, their 
parents, and their employers ``of the grave dangers that these machines 
represent to working children.'' The Department has carefully reviewed the 
comments of the YWN, AFL- CIO, and CLC. It has decided to adopt the proposal as 
written, with one clarifying modification. Since the enactment of FLSA section 
13(c)(7) on January 23, 2004, the Department's enforcement position has been 
that the employment of 14- and 15-year-olds employed under the provisions of 
that section must still be in compliance with all other provisions of Reg. 3, 
including the hours and time of day standards of Sec. 570.35. Although this is 
evidenced by the Department's compliance and enforcement guidance and the 
structure of the NPRM, it was not explicitly stated in the proposed rule. The 
Department received an inquiry on this issue after the publication of the 
proposal. In order to prevent any possible confusion and to provide maximum 
clarity, the Department has revised the Final Rule by adding the following 
sentence to the end of Sec. 570.34(m)(2): The employment of youth under this 
section must comply with the other sections of this subpart, including the 
hours and time of day standards established by Sec. 570.35. The Department 
appreciates the support and concerns of the commenters. The Department believes 
that the youths who will be employed under the provisions of FLSA section 
13(c)(7) will receive significant workplace protections from the statute and 
these resulting regulations. Requiring pre-employment certification or training 
of youth was not envisioned by Congress, especially for a population of young 
workers whose formal education ends at such an early age. The Department also 
believes that the CLC recommendations that the ratio of supervisors to young 
workers should be one-to-one and that all adults supervising have experience in 
the workplace or the industry were not contemplated by Congress and would be 
viewed as excessive. Similarly, the Department believes that the CLC 
recommendation regarding the mandatory reporting of work-related injuries and 
deaths that might occur to youth employed under the provisions of FLSA section 
13(c)(7) would be duplicative of the reporting requirements already established 
by OSHA. The Department has long recognized the importance of, and the benefits 
resulting from, OSHA and WHD working together to share enforcement expertise 
and information, and to leverage compliance assistance initiatives. As 
recognized by the CLC, these two agencies have a long and productive history of 
partnering for the benefit of American workers and those who employ them. It is 
the Department's intention that this relationship will continue to grow and 
accommodate additional partnering opportunities as they arise. As stated in the 
Final Rule, WHD will continue to rely on OSHA's expertise for guidance when 
applying the specific occupational health and safety-affecting requirements of 
FLSA section 13(c)(7) (see Sec. 570.34(m)(1)(iii) and (iv)) as well as when 
assessing the risks from potential exposures to toxic chemicals; but WHD will 
not itself issue citations for violations of OSHA standards. As the CLC stated, 
``DOL's OSHA experts are familiar with these hazards.'' Finally, the Department 
is well aware of the importance of keeping all stakeholders informed of its 
compliance assistance initiatives and enforcement findings, and of serious 
occupational injuries involving youth. WHD, OSHA, and NIOSH have, for many 
years, shared information among themselves concerning occupational injuries 
that have contributed to the deaths of young workers as soon as one of the 
parties learned of the death. WHD, OSHA, and NIOSH then work together to ensure 
that the appropriate rules are followed and enforced and to learn from each 
event in the hopes that future tragedies can be prevented. This cooperation 
will continue after the adoption of the Final Rule. C. Periods and Conditions 
of Employment (29 CFR 570.35) FLSA section 3(l) authorizes the Secretary of 
Labor to provide by regulation for the employment of young workers 14 and 15 
years of age in suitable nonagricultural occupations and during periods and 
under conditions that will not interfere with their schooling or with their 
health and well-being. In enacting FLSA section 3(l), Congress intended to 
assure the health and educational opportunities of 14- and 15-year- olds, while 
allowing them limited employment opportunities. Reg. 3 was promulgated in 1939 
under the direction of the Chief of the Children's Bureau, in whom Congress 
vested the original delegation of authority to issue child labor regulations. 
The record on which Reg. 3 was based included hearings where advocates of 
children expressed concern over the need for children to avoid fatigue, so as 
not to deplete the energy required for their school work. Similarly, witnesses 
stressed that early morning and late evening work hours, which interfered with 
sleep and often fostered exhaustion, were unhealthful for children and also 
diminished the time that children should have spent with the family (see In the 
Matter of Proposed Regulation Relating to the Employment of Minors Between 14 
and 16 Years of Age Under the Fair Labor Standards Act, Official Report of the 
Proceedings Before the Children's Bureau, February 15, 1939, at 19, 21, 34, 
82). Reg. 3 limits the hours that 14- and 15-year-olds may work to: (1) Outside 
school hours; (2) Not more than 40 hours in any 1 week when school is not in 
session; (3) Not more than 18 hours in any 1 week when school is in session; 
(4) Not more than 8 hours in any 1 day when school is not in session; (5) Not 
more than 3 hours in any 1 day when school is in session; and (6) Between 7 
a.m. and 7 p.m. in any 1 day, except during the summer (June 1 through Labor 
Day) when the evening hour will be 9 p.m. The Department did not propose to 
change any of these hours and time-of-day limitations, but wished to foster 
both understanding of, and compliance with, these provisions by incorporating 
into the regulations certain long-standing Departmental enforcement positions 
and interpretations. For example, the Department has developed long- standing 
enforcement positions regarding the application of certain of the hours 
standards limitations to minors who, for differing reasons, no [[Page 28423]] 
longer attend or are unable to attend school. Some of these positions have been 
in place since the 1970s and all have been detailed in the Wage and Hour 
Division's Field Operations Handbook since 1993. The Department proposed to 
incorporate them into Reg. 3 to promote both clarity and compliance. The 
Department proposed to amend Sec. 570.35 to reflect that school would not be 
considered to be in session for a 14- or 15-year-old minor who has graduated 
from high school; or has been excused from compulsory school attendance by the 
state or other jurisdiction once he or she has completed the eighth grade and 
his or her employment complies with all the requirements of the state school 
attendance law; or has a child to support and appropriate state officers, 
pursuant to state law, have waived school attendance requirements for this 
minor; or is subject to an order of a state or federal court prohibiting him or 
her from attending school; or has been permanently expelled from the local 
public school he or she would normally attend. Such minors would be exempt from 
the ``when school is in session'' hours standards limitations contained in Sec. 
Sec. 570.35(a)(1), (a)(3) and (a)(5). The employment of such minors would still 
be governed by the remaining provisions of Reg. 3, including the daily, weekly, 
morning, and evening hours standards limitations contained in Sec. Sec. 
570.35(a)(2), (a)(4), and (a)(6). The Department also proposed to clarify the 
hours restriction contained in Sec. 570.35(a)(5), which limits the employment 
of 14- and 15-year-olds in nonagricultural employment to no more than 3 hours 
on a day when school is in session, by adding a statement that this restriction 
also applies to Fridays. The WHD occasionally receives requests for 
clarification from employers seeking to lengthen the work shifts of younger 
employees on nights that do not precede a school day. As the stated purposes of 
the hours standards limitations include the protection of young workers from 
exhaustion and the preservation of time for rest and family relations, no more 
than 3 hours of work is permitted on any day when school is in session. The 
Department also proposed to incorporate into Reg. 3 its long- standing position 
that the term week as used in Reg. 3 means a standard calendar week of 12:01 
a.m. Sunday through midnight Saturday, not an employer's workweek as defined in 
29 CFR 778.105. The calendar week would continue to serve as the timeframe for 
determining whether a minor worked in excess of 18 hours during any week when 
school was in session or in excess of 40 hours in any week when school was not 
in session. Finally, as noted above, Reg. 3 limits the employment of 14- and 
15-year-olds to periods that are outside of school hours and to designated 
hours depending upon whether or not school is in session. Although neither the 
FLSA nor Reg. 3 defines the terms school hours and school is in session as they 
apply to nonagricultural employment, the Department has developed and applied a 
long-standing enforcement position that these terms refer to the normal hours 
of the public school system in the child's district of residence. This 
enforcement position mirrors the provisions of FLSA section 13(c)(1), which 
Congress added in 1949, to clarify how these terms apply to the employment of 
youth in agricultural employment. FLSA section 13(c)(1) states, in relevant 
part: ``The provisions of section 212 of this title relating to child labor 
shall not apply to any employee employed in agriculture outside of school hours 
for the school district where such employee is living while he is so employed, 
if such employee * * *. (C) is fourteen years of age or older.'' Though the 
Department did not propose specific regulatory language regarding these terms 
when it published the NPRM, it did seek information from the public regarding 
whether such regulatory provisions would be appropriate, including whether: (1) 
The Department should continue to use the hours of operation of the local 
public school where a minor resides to determine when he or she may legally be 
employed, even when that minor does not attend that local public school or, for 
whatever reason, may actually have attendance requirements that differ from 
those of the rest of the students attending that local school; (2) the FLSA's 
requirement that such a minor only be employed under conditions and during 
periods that will not interfere with his or her schooling or health and 
well-being would be equally or better served if it were based on the minor's 
own actual academic schedule; and (3) using the academic schedule and 
attendance requirements of each minor when determining when school was in 
session for that minor would provide working youths greater opportunities and 
flexibility when seeking safe, positive and legal employment. The Department 
stated that, based on the comments it received, it would consider adding 
regulatory provisions to the Final Rule defining the terms school hours and 
school is in session as they apply to nonagricultural employment. The 
Department received nine comments on this proposal. Two commenters, the YWN and 
the CLC, addressed the proposal to incorporate into Sec. 570.35 certain 
long-standing departmental enforcement positions regarding the application of 
the hours standards. Both supported the Department's enforcement positions that 
school should not be considered in session for a 14- or 15-year-old youth who 
has graduated from high school; has been excused from compulsory school 
attendance by the state or other jurisdiction once he or she has completed the 
eighth grade and his or her employment complies with all the provisions of the 
state school attendance law; or is subject to an order prohibiting him or her 
from attending school. Although the YWN supported the proposals that school 
should also not be considered in session for a youth who (1) has a child to 
support and appropriate state officers, pursuant to state law, have waived 
school attendance requirements for that minor, or (2) has been permanently 
expelled from the local public school he or she would normally attend, the CLC 
did not. The CLC stated that it believes it is ``ill-advised to excuse 14- and 
15-year-olds from compulsory school attendance on the basis of parental status. 
It serves the best interests of the 14- and 15-year- old parent, as well as the 
young parent's child, for the parent to complete his or her education, thus 
realizing a long-term benefit of increased and better employment in the 
future.'' The CLC stated that a child permanently expelled from public school 
might still be required, under state or local law or perhaps court order, to 
attend some other school. The CLC recommended that the Department amend its 
proposed revision to read ``Has been permanently expelled from the local public 
school he or she would normally attend, unless the child is required, by state 
or local law or ordinance, or by court order, to attend another school.'' Only 
the YWN and CLC commented on the Department's proposal to clarify the Reg. 3 
limitation that 14- and 15-year-olds may not be employed to work more than 
three hours on any one day when school is in session by adding the phrase 
``including Fridays.'' Both the YWN and the CLC supported this proposal. The 
representative of White Hat recommended that participants in programs similar 
to those of the charter schools he advises should be permitted to work up to 
five hours on a school day. The Department received six comments that addressed 
its proposal to incorporate into Reg. 3 its long-standing [[Page 28424]] 
position that the term ``week'' as used in Reg. 3 means a standard calendar 
week of 12:01 a.m. Sunday through midnight Saturday, not an employer's workweek 
as defined in 29 CFR 778.105. The proposal stated that the calendar week would 
continue to serve as the timeframe for determining whether a minor worked in 
excess of 18 hours during any week when school was in session or in excess of 
40 hours in any week when school was not in session. Both the YWN and CLC 
supported this proposal. Four commenters, the Food Marketing Institute (FMI), 
Six Flags, the WWA, and the representative of Morey's Pier, opposed the 
proposal. The FMI described itself as a conductor of ``programs in research, 
education, industry relations and public affairs on behalf of its 1,500 member 
companies-- food retailers and wholesalers--in the United States and around the 
world.'' The FMI reported that its retail membership is composed of large 
multi-store chains, regional firms and independent supermarkets. The FMI stated 
``[w]e strongly object to this change, which would create an administrative 
nightmare, and see no reason for it.'' The FMI commented that most of its 
members already have systems in place based on their own workweeks that 
automatically check hours worked to make sure minors do not exceed their 
allowable hours. ``By requiring the use of a Sunday to Saturday midnight week, 
employers would be forced to check hours worked manually, making it more likely 
that mistakes would be made.'' The WWA echoed the concerns of the FMI and asked 
that the proposed rule be amended to allow employers to calculate hours worked 
so that Saturday and Sunday hours may be included within the same workweek. Six 
Flags expressed the same concern regarding its ability to use its payroll 
tracking system as a compliance tool and recommended that the Department allow 
employers to use any reasonable system such as labor tracking and payroll 
monitoring tools that complement their record keeping systems. The 
representative of Morey's Pier recommended that the term workweek should be 
defined, but not necessarily by the calendar. The Department received six 
comments on its enforcement position that defines the term school in session as 
applying to the normal hours of the public school system in the minor 
employee's district of residence. The YWN and the CLC supported using the hours 
of the local public school district the minor would attend if he or she 
attended public school when defining the term school in session. The YWN 
praised the enforcement benefits that would arise from having only one standard 
in each school district, thereby avoiding multiple schedules that would create 
unworkable and needlessly complex enforcement standards. The YWN also suggested 
that the Department should clearly state in the Final Rule that school is 
considered to be in session during any week in which school attendance is 
required for one or more days. The CLC commented that ``[if] the school day 
schedules established by private schools and by parents of home-schooled 
children could determine when children being educated in those settings 
governed here, there would be nothing in the DOL child labor regulations that 
would prevent such a school or parent from setting a schedule that would permit 
children to work during the hours that the public school system is in session. 
Indeed, non-public schools could be established by organizations whose prime 
goal is to provide 14- and 15-year-old working children to employers during 
normal business hours in the middle of the day, rather than to make sure that 
the children are in school during the hours when they are most alert and 
receptive to classroom instruction. We do not say that there would be many such 
schools or home-schooling parents, but the mere fact that such outcomes could 
occur should be reason enough to cause DOL to reject this approach.'' The CLC, 
when commenting on the Department's inquiry regarding whether employers of 
working youth should be given greater flexibility, stated ``[t]here is no need 
for DOL to bend over backwards to try to assure that children have the absolute 
maximum opportunity to squeeze every possible minute of the day into the three 
hours that they can work during a school day. This approach seems to us to give 
far more emphasis to work experiences for 14- and 15-year-olds than to their 
education.'' The National Council of Chain Restaurants (Council), the 
representative of Morey's Pier, and the FMI supported defining the term school 
in session by following the academic schedule and attendance requirements of 
each minor, rather than that of the local public school. The Council noted that 
frequently ``the academic schedule and attendance requirements followed by 
public schools do differ, sometimes significantly, from the schedule followed 
by private schools. By applying each minor's actual school schedule, rather 
than arbitrarily applying the local public school schedule, job opportunities 
would be expanded for minors subject to Child Labor Reg. 3 without adversely 
impacting the school work of such minors.'' The FMI stated that adopting the 
hours of the local public school when defining the term school is in session 
would ``make no sense'' for the many young people who do not go to public 
schools. The FMI found it ``hard to understand why their work hours should be 
governed by a school system they have nothing to do with.'' The representative 
of Morey's Pier believed that each minor should be treated individually and 
that his or her own academic schedule and attendance requirements should be 
used when determining when school was in session for the minor. Barring 
adoption of her recommendation, she believed the Department's enforcement 
position to be the ``second best option.'' The DOLWD did not oppose this 
enforcement position but suggested that an ``exception'' from the definition of 
school is in session should be created for youth enrolled in home school or 
other alternative school programs based on considerations of ``whether the work 
interferes with the individual's schooling, health or well being rather than 
the hours of operation for public schools.'' The DOLWD also suggested that the 
federal regulations on the number of hours that 14- and 15-year-olds may work 
should be amended to be consistent with the more permissive standards 
established in Alaska. The Council also recommended that the Department expand 
the number of hours that such youth may be employed to four hours on any school 
day; to as late as 8 p.m. on any evening between Labor Day and May 31st; and as 
late as 10 p.m. on any evening between June 1st and Labor Day. The YWN 
recommended that the Department eliminate the reference to between June 1st and 
Labor Day and replace it with the actual calendar of each public school, noting 
that an increasing number of school districts have year- round schedules. After 
carefully reviewing the comments, the Department has decided to continue its 
long-standing enforcement position that school hours are defined by the hours 
that the local public school district where the minor resides when employed is 
in session, and to add this definition to Sec. 570.35(b) to avoid confusion and 
to simplify both compliance and enforcement of the hours standards of Reg. 3. 
The Department has also included in this definition the YWN's recommended 
clarifying statement that school should be considered to be in session during 
any week when school attendance is [[Page 28425]] required for any portion of a 
day. The Department is also adding to that section its long-standing position 
that outside school hours means such periods as before and after school hours, 
holidays, summer vacations, weekends, and any other day or part of a day when 
the local public school district where the minor resides while employed is not 
in session. This section will also note that summer school sessions, held in 
addition to the regularly scheduled school year, are considered to be outside 
of school hours. The Department appreciates the concerns of the one employer 
and two employer associations that recommended that an employee's own academic 
schedule and individual attendance requirements should be used to determine 
when school is in session for that minor and recognizes how such a position 
could be seen as a means of providing minors with more work experiences while 
addressing employer staffing problems. But the Department is concerned that 
such a system may not give the proper emphasis to obtaining an education and 
would make employer compliance and WHD enforcement more difficult and more 
complicated than necessary, given the broad variety of daily school schedules 
that each young employee could have. The Department believes that the 
continuation and incorporation of this enforcement position brings clarity in 
that employers need only look to the hours of operation of the local public 
school where the minor resides to attain compliance. It also ensures that the 
consistent application of these terms for both agricultural and nonagricultural 
employment will continue, thereby avoiding confusion among those employers who 
offer both agricultural and nonagricultural employment to young workers. 
Finally, continuation of this enforcement position facilitates the enforcement 
of the Reg. 3 hours standards by establishing a single, easily determinable 
standard. The Department also believes that continuation of this enforcement 
position is appropriate as it does not provide any minor or class of minors 
with an incentive to leave public school or with an unfair and improper 
advantage over public school youth when competing for employment. The 
Department notes the CLC's concerns that determining when school is in session 
by using each student's individual academic schedule could foster the 
development of nonpublic schools or home- schooling programs created primarily 
to provide 14- and 15-year-old working children to employers during the hours 
they would normally have attended public school. While the Department agrees 
with the CLC that it is unlikely that many such schools or home-schooling 
programs would materialize, it does note that the emergence of schools that 
were designed to allow migrant children to work on farms during the daylight 
hours when the local public school was in session, was an impetus for the 1949 
amendment to the FLSA that codified this very same enforcement position as it 
relates to agricultural employment. The Department has decided not to 
incorporate into Reg. 3 its long- standing enforcement position that a calendar 
week--12:01 a.m. Sunday through midnight Saturday--shall be the framework for 
determining if a 14- or 15-year-old has been employed more than 18 hours in any 
week when school is in session or more than 40 hours in any week when school is 
not is session. The Department agrees with several commenters who noted that 
applying the same definition of the term week for determining compliance with 
the minimum wage, overtime, and child labor provisions of the FLSA would make 
it much easier for employers to use their payroll systems as tools and tracking 
systems for implementing and maintaining compliance with the child labor 
requirements. Accordingly, as suggested by those commenters, the Department 
will define the term week as used in Reg. 3 to be the same workweek the 
employer establishes for the youth to determine overtime compensation under 29 
CFR 778.105--a fixed and regularly recurring period of 168 hours--seven 
consecutive 24-hour periods. Finally, the Department acknowledges the 
recommendations of the DOLWD, the Council, and the representative of White Hat 
regarding the relaxation of certain of the hours and time of day restrictions 
of Reg. 3 to permit 14- and 15-year-olds to work more hours on a school day or 
in a school week, or later into the evening. As noted in the NPRM, the 
Department did not propose any revisions to those standards. Any such changes, 
therefore, would be outside the scope of this rulemaking. D. Work-Study 
Programs Effective November 5, 1969, Reg. 3 was amended to provide a variance 
from some of the provisions of Sec. 570.35 for the employment of minors 14 and 
15 years of age enrolled in and employed pursuant to a school-supervised and 
administered Work Experience and Career Exploration Program (WECEP). Although 
originally proposed as an experimental program, Reg. 3 was amended to make the 
WECEP a permanent exception. WECEP was created to provide a carefully planned 
work experience and career exploration program for 14- and 15-year-old youth 
who can benefit from a career-oriented educational program designed especially 
to meet the participants' needs, interests, and abilities. The program was, and 
continues to be, specifically geared to helping dropout-prone youth become 
reoriented and motivated toward education and to prepare for the world of work. 
WECEPs may, however, be tailored to meet the needs of other students as well. 
Section 570.35a establishes the criteria that must be met in order for states 
to apply for and receive authorization to operate a WECEP. This same section 
details the terms, conditions, and responsibilities participating states agree 
to assume upon receiving authorization to operate a WECEP. As mentioned, 
certain provisions of Sec. 570.35 relating to the Reg. 3 hours standards are 
varied for youth enrolled in and employed pursuant to an approved WECEP. Such 
youth may work up to 23 hours in any one week when school is in session and not 
more than 3 hours in any day when school is in session, any portion of which 
may be during school hours. The other provisions of Sec. 570.35 (limiting 
employment to no more than 8 hours a day on any one day school is not in 
session, and no more than 40 hours in any one week when school is not in 
session) remain applicable to the employment of WECEP participants. Section 
570.35a also includes provisions that allow the Administrator of the Wage and 
Hour Division discretion to grant requests for special variances from the 
occupation standards established by Sec. Sec. 570.33 and 570.34. Several states 
have advised the Department that WECEP serves its targeted audience well, 
helping those who are not academically oriented stay in school and complete 
their high school educations. However, WECEP, by design, does little to help 
those students who wish to use work experience, and the wages such experiences 
generate, as a means to realize their academic potential and acquire a college 
education. In 2003, the Department became aware of a non-profit network of 
private schools, hereafter referred to as the Network, that was operating a 
corporate work-study program for its students. The Network is an association of 
private, not-for-profit college preparatory high schools that strive to [[Page 
28426]] meet the educational needs of people in many economically challenged 
areas throughout the country. The work-study program was implemented to help 
students offset the costs of a quality college preparatory education and 
develop important work experience and socialization skills that will allow them 
to assume leadership roles as adults. Under the Network's model, four students 
share a single, full-time clerical position with a private employer at a work 
place screened and selected by the school. Each youth works five full days per 
four-week period for the employer at the work place--one eight-hour day once a 
week for three weeks, and two eight-hour days every fourth week. The academic 
schedules of the students are carefully coordinated so that students do not 
miss any classes on the days they work and the school year has been extended 
beyond the standard academic schedule of the local public school to compensate 
for the time the students spend at work. These accommodations ensure that 
students complete a fully accredited, college preparatory curriculum that 
exceeds both state and accrediting agency requirements. Under the Network 
model, students do not work more than eight hours a day, before 7 a.m. or after 
7 p.m., and are transported to and from their jobs by the school. The students 
receive at least the applicable federal and state minimum wages, and applicable 
taxes are withheld and reported by their respective employers. The Network 
envisioned the work-study program as an integral part of the academic program, 
yielding benefits on many different levels. Students, their parents, and the 
work-study director sign an agreement defining performance expectations and 
program support structures. Participating employers are also required to sign 
an agreement defining job duties and expectations. All students are required to 
participate in the work-study program, beginning with their freshman year and 
ending at graduation. The Network provided information that its model is 
achieving its stated aims. It advised the Department that 100 percent of the 
students of the 2003 graduating class of one of its schools were accepted into 
college. The school is located in a neighborhood where 20 percent of those 
attending the local public school drop out annually and the high school 
graduation rate of the local public school is 55 percent. Reg. 3, as currently 
written, does not allow 14- and 15-year-olds to participate in the Network's 
work-study programs. Such youth may not work during the hours school is in 
session--unless participating in a state sponsored WECEP--and may not work more 
than three hours on a day the local public school is in session. Because the 
Department believes that the health, well-being, and educational opportunities 
of 14- and 15-year-olds who are academically oriented are not placed at risk by 
participation in structured work- study programs such as the Network's 
model--and are in fact enhanced by such participation--it proposed that Reg. 3 
be revised to accommodate such programs. The Department proposed to allow 
public and private school districts or systems to apply to the Administrator of 
the Wage and Hour Division for approval to operate a work-study program that 
would permit certain 14- and 15-year-olds to work during school hours and up to 
eight hours on a school day under specific circumstances. An individual private 
school that was not part of a network, district, or system would also be able 
to apply to participate in a work study program. The youth would have to be 
enrolled in a college preparatory curriculum and must receive, every year they 
participate in the work- study program, at least the minimum number of hours of 
class room instruction required by the applicable state educational agency 
responsible for establishing such standards. Participating youth would also be 
required to receive annual classroom instruction in workplace safety and child 
labor provisions. Home-schooled youth would be able to participate in 
work-study programs operated by local public schools in the same manner many 
currently participate in team sports programs, band, and other extracurricular 
activities. Each participating school would be required to name a teacher- 
coordinator to supervise the work-study program, make regularly scheduled 
visits to the students' work sites, and ensure that participants are employed 
in compliance with the minimum wage and child labor provisions of the FLSA. In 
addition, the teacher-coordinator, the employer and the student would be 
required to sign a written participation agreement that details the objectives 
of the work-study program, describes the specific job duties to be performed by 
the student, and the number of hours and times of day that the student would be 
employed each week. The agreement, which must also be signed or otherwise 
consented to by the student's parent or guardian, would also affirm that the 
student will receive the minimum number of hours of class room instruction as 
required by the state educational agency for the completion of a 
fully-accredited college preparatory curriculum and that the employment will 
comply with the applicable child labor and minimum wage provisions of the FLSA. 
Students participating in a valid work-study program would be permitted to work 
up to eighteen hours a week, a portion of which may be during school hours, in 
accordance with the following formula that is based upon a continuous four-week 
cycle. In three of the four weeks, the participant would be permitted to work 
during school hours on only one day per week, and for no more than eight hours 
on that day. During the remaining week of the four-week cycle, such minor would 
be permitted to work during school hours on no more than two days, and for no 
more than eight hours on each of those two days. The employment of such minors 
would still be subject to the time of day and number of hours standards 
contained in Sec. 570.35(a)(2), (a)(3), (a)(4), and (a)(6). The Department 
received eight comments on this proposal. The Cristo Rey Network, which 
described itself as ``a non-profit corporation that co-ordinates twelve college 
prep high schools across the country,'' self-identified itself as the Network 
that the Department describes in the NPRM. The Cristo Rey Network was most 
supportive of the proposal and noted that its work-study program meets the 
statutory objective of permitting youth employment only ``during periods and 
under conditions that will not interfere with their schooling or health and 
well being'' as required by FLSA section 3(l). Cristo Rey stated ``[m]eeting 
those objectives can be quantified in Cristo Rey's 97+% attendance rate and/ or 
in its graduates' own achievements: i.e., of 219 graduates in 2006, 212 were 
accepted into colleges including schools such as the University of California 
at Berkley, the University of Illinois, the University of Notre Dame, the 
University of Chicago, and Wellesley College; and the success continues: of 318 
graduates in 2007, 313 will attend college this Fall.'' Cristo Rey noted that 
the schools in the Network provide an option for private education to children 
who are ``predominantly Latino (63%) or African-American (25%) and who are all 
from economically-disadvantaged families; the average family income of these 
students is approximately $33,000--far too little to make private education an 
option absent the work-study program that the schools in the Network have 
pioneered.'' The YWN disagreed with the proposal, stating that Sec. 570.35a 
already includes provisions that allow the WHD [[Page 28427]] to grant requests 
for special variances from the occupation standards regarding prohibited work, 
and that this should be expanded to grant variances from the Reg. 3 hours 
standards as well. The YWN stated that this proposal benefits one single 
program and makes the regulations unnecessarily complex. It also raises 
concerns that the ``host employer'' might not be subject to the same 
restrictions and requirements as any other employer who hires youth and that 
students may be replacing a ``regular paid employee.'' The CLC noted that it 
had several serious concerns about this proposal. It felt that the proposal was 
so narrowly tailored to one specific program that it could easily bar other 
school systems ``that have similar, but not identical, approaches'' from taking 
advantage of the program. The CLC stated that ``[w]hat is particularly 
troubling-- and what DOL does not indicate in its preamble to the proposed 
regulation--is that the only school system that appears to qualify for the 
proposed program is a private Roman Catholic system.'' The CLC stated that 
``[t]he DOL proposal raises serious questions under the First Amendment to the 
United States Constitution, which forbids the government favoring one religious 
sect over another.'' The CLC also raised concerns as to whether DOL would ``be 
able to assure that no violations occur under this system'' and of ``the 
secrecy of the approval process that DOL would adopt.'' The CLC believed that 
the proposed approval process is not sufficiently transparent and recommended 
that DOL be required to publish a notice in the Federal Register detailing 
every work-study program application and invite public comment during a 
specified period of 30 or 60 days. The CLC also noted that the proposal would 
not prohibit an employer from replacing a permanent worker at an establishment 
participating in the work-study program with student-workers, as prohibited 
under the WECEP provisions contained in Sec. 570.35a(e). The CLC also expressed 
concerns that the Cristo Rey Network has been operating a work-study program 
for almost a decade and questioned how much of each youth's pay check goes to 
Cristo Rey and how much, if any, goes to the youth. Finally, the CLC also 
questioned, as did the YWN, if the ``host employers'' or the Cristo Rey High 
School would be considered the actual employers of the youth under the FLSA. 
The Department received several comments supporting the creation of a 
work-study program that would allow youth to work during the hours school was 
in session, but opposing that such a program be limited, as the Department 
proposed, to students enrolled in a college preparatory curriculum. The DOLWD 
recommended that the program should be expanded to include pre-apprenticeship 
work training programs, and a representative of the New Jersey Department of 
Education (NJDOE) recommended that ``determining the educational and 
eligibility requirements for such programs be left to state education 
agencies.'' The NJDOE also stated that the Department's proposal to limit 
participation in the work-study program ``conflicts with the federal No Child 
Left Behind Act, the federal Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education 
Act, the federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, and state laws 
and regulations, which require state education agencies and public schools to 
serve all students and provide all students with comprehensive career 
education, including opportunities to further explore careers in work-based 
learning activities.'' The representative of White Hat supported the creation 
of a work- study program but suggested that charter schools of the type he 
represents should not be subjected to the ``bureaucratic requirements'' imposed 
by the work-study application process proposed by the Department, ``which can 
be prohibitive for some smaller schools and which serve to take needed 
resources away from educational instruction and helping more students.'' He 
also stated that limiting participation in the proposed work-study program to 
students enrolled in a college preparatory curriculum ``can also have the 
unintended consequence of denying extended work hours and compensation from 
those who need it the most, the undereducated.'' A representative of the 
National Association of State Directors of Career Technical Education 
Consortium (State Directors) apparently believed that the adoption of the 
proposal contained in Sec. 570.35b would preclude anyone but a student enrolled 
in a college preparatory curriculum from participating in any work-study 
program in the future. He stated ``such a rule would cripple career technical 
education (CTE) programs that have work-based learning opportunities embedded 
within the curriculum.'' The same assumption was made by a teacher at the 
Sunrise Mountain High School in Peoria, Arizona who commented ``[t]hese 
internships provide our students valuable hands-on experiences to help connect 
school and careers in a meaningful way. The RIN 1215-AB44 proposal would remove 
this valuable learning experience from our students.'' The Department has 
carefully reviewed the comments and has decided to implement the proposal as 
written with two minor modifications. The first modification involves a 
redesignation of the sections dealing with both WECEP and the Work Study 
Program as requested by the Federal Register. The current Sec. 570.35a will be 
redesignated as Sec. 570.36 and the proposed Sec. 570.35b will be issued as 
Sec. 570.37. The second modification clarifies the role of the 
teacher-coordinator. The Department wishes to emphasize that this proposal 
creates a new, limited, work-study program designed to accommodate the needs of 
a narrowly defined population--14- and 15-year-old students enrolled in a 
college preparatory curriculum at a public or private school that has been 
granted authority to operate such a program by the Department. This new program 
does not in any way negate or preclude schools or employers from participating 
in other preexisting or future work-study programs, work experience and/or 
career exploration programs, internships, or apprenticeships that also comport 
with the provisions of the FLSA (whether with the hours standards and time of 
day restrictions in Sec. 570.35 or the special WECEP rules in Sec. 570.35a 
(old) and Sec. 570.36 (new)). This proposal was developed and offered solely 
with the intent, as stated earlier in this section, of providing reasonable and 
structured accommodations within Reg. 3 so that academically oriented 14- and 
15-year-olds could begin their pursuit of college educations through work-study 
programs. Participation in the proposed work-study program is voluntary and it 
in no way conflicts with other federal, state, or local programs addressing the 
educational needs of young workers. The concerns of the State Directors and the 
NJDOE are unfounded. The Department appreciates the recommendations of several 
commenters that the work-study program should be extended to youth enrolled in 
programs other than college preparatory, such as vocational programs, 
internships, and apprenticeships. The Department notes that the already 
existing WECEP (see Sec. 570.36 (new)) would provide those programs with 
limited exemptions from the hours standards contained in Sec. 570.35(a) that 
are similar to the exemptions provided by the proposed work-study program. The 
Department also disagrees with the YWN and CLC comments that the [[Page 28428]] 
proposed work-study program was designed to accommodate a single program--the 
Cristo Rey Network. Although the Cristo Rey Network work- study model was 
reviewed by the Department, the proposed work-study program differs 
considerably from that model. The Department's proposed WSP, unlike the Cristo 
Rey model, requires annual classroom instruction in workplace safety and state 
and federal child labor provisions and rules (see Sec. 570.37(b)(3)(ii)), the 
oversight of a designated teacher-coordinator required to make visits to the 
students' workplaces (see Sec. 570.37(b)(3)(iii)), the completion of a detailed 
written participation agreement (see Sec. 570.37(b)(3)(iv)), and a rigorous 
certification process. The Department believes that these additional 
requirements, many of which correspond to the criteria established for 
operating a WECEP under Sec. 570.36 (new), will provide adequate protections to 
all students who participate in an approved work-study program under the 
provisions of Sec. 570.37 (new). The Department also believes that the 
certification process as proposed by the Department, which again is similar to 
that required of WECEP applicants, provides sufficient transparency without 
requiring publication in the Federal Register or public comment. In addition, 
pursuant to the President's commitment to openness and transparency,\1\ the 
Department intends to publish the list of schools authorized to operate a 
work-study program on the WHD Web site. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------- \1\ 
January 21, 2009 Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and 
Agencies, available at:http:// edocket.access.gpo.gov/2009/pdf/E9-1777.pdf. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------- The 
Department also notes that the proposed work-study program provides 
considerable flexibility to those schools that choose to participate. The 
limitations on the number of hours that participating students may be employed 
(see Sec. 570.37(c) (new)), though in line with those established by the Cristo 
Rey Network, constitute the absolute maximum number of hours that participants 
may be employed. Participating schools and employers may choose to adopt some 
other schedule of work hours that comport with the established maxima--such as 
one four-hour day or one six-hour day each workweek; or two eight- hour days 
each weekend; or three hours a day at the end of each of three school days, as 
long as those hours comply with end-of-day hours standards established by Sec. 
570.35(a)(6). In addition, a school could apply and receive authorization under 
Sec. 570.37 (new) to operate a work-study program for just one student, one 
group of students, or, as in the case of the Cristo Rey Network, the entire 
student body. The Department wishes to emphasize that the development of this 
student-work program was never intended to advantage any single, private school 
system, but was proposed for the benefit of all academically motivated students 
enrolled in college preparatory curricula that can avail themselves of such a 
program of employment that clearly facilitates, rather than interferes with, 
their schooling. The Department, for this very reason, did not specifically 
identify the Cristo Rey Network in the NPRM. It did not want the public 
mistakenly to believe that participation in the proposed work-study program 
would be limited to private schools, public schools, or any particular 
religious or nonreligious sect. For similar reasons, the Department did not 
identify the municipalities that inquired about the employment of youth by 
state and local governments and as lifeguards, which led to the Department's 
enforcement positions on those topics. Since publication of the NPRM, the 
Department has received inquiries from public schools and private schools (not 
part of the Cristo Rey Network) about establishing work-study programs under 
Sec. 570.37 (new). The Department also wishes to assure both the YWN and CLC 
that employers participating in the work-study program authorized by Sec. 
570.37 (new) would indeed be the employer of the youth under the FLSA and held 
to all the Act's minimum wage, overtime, record keeping, and child labor 
provisions--unless subject to a specific exemption or exception--as would any 
other employer. In fact, depending upon the facts of each situation and the 
degree of control the school exercises over the employment of the participating 
student, it is possible that the student would be considered to be jointly 
employed by the host- employer and the youth's school under the FLSA (see 29 
CFR part 791). The FLSA would require that students participating in the 
work-study program, if covered by the Act and not exempt from the minimum wage 
requirements of section 6, receive the applicable minimum wage for all hours 
worked. Such students may, in accordance with 29 CFR 531.40, make a voluntary 
assignment of their wages to a third party. The employment of students 
participating in the work-study program would also most likely be subject to 
state wage requirements and child labor provisions. When state and federal 
requirements differ, the FLSA does not supersede any more protective state 
child labor requirement and employers must normally comply with the more 
stringent standard. Under Sec. 570.37 (new), the participating school district 
and employers share the burden of ensuring that the employment of work- study 
program participants is in compliance with the FLSA. When the Department 
conducts an investigation of a work-study program participating employer, it 
will follow its normal investigation procedures to determine if the employer 
complied with child labor requirements. The employer will be held responsible 
for any violations of the FLSA or the child labor regulations. But the 
Department considers it appropriate that the school district sponsoring the 
work- study assist the employer in the both achieving and monitoring the 
compliance of the work-study program. Therefore, the Department has revised the 
proposed regulatory language at Sec. 570.37(b)(3)(iii) to emphasize the role of 
the teacher-coordinator in confirming that the employment of the work-study 
program participant complies with the child labor and minimum wage requirements 
of the FLSA. In addition, when a school system files a letter of application to 
renew an existing work-study program, it will be required to note that the 
teacher-coordinator has confirmed that the employment of students in the 
work-study program has been in compliance with the child labor and minimum wage 
provisions of the FLSA. The Department believes that the teacher-coordinator 
occupies an ideal position to both help the employer attain and maintain 
compliance with the all the requirements of work-study program and assist the 
Department's enforcement efforts by confirming that compliance. In addition to 
the regularly scheduled visits to the workplaces the teacher-coordinator is 
required to make, the Department suggests that such things as frequent 
interactions with the work-study program students, program assessments and 
evaluations completed by the students and the employers, and surprise or 
unscheduled visits to the workplaces can all contribute to the operation of a 
safe, compliant, and positive work-study program. The suggested methods of 
confirmation are purely discretionary; no work-study participating school 
district will be penalized for not adopting them. The Department notes that it 
is not imposing any recordkeeping burdens on the employers or the school 
districts beyond those proposed in the 2007 NPRM, therefore no additional 
estimates of costs or burdens will be incurred that [[Page 28429]] must be 
accounted for pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act and Regulatory 
Flexibility Act. The Department appreciates the concerns of both the YWN and 
the CLC that the proposed work-study program, unlike the WECEP, does not 
prohibit participating employers from displacing a worker already employed in 
the employer's establishment with a student (see Sec. 570.36(e) (new)). The 
Department's experience with the pilot work-study program indicates that most 
of the jobs occupied by the students were entry-level positions created 
especially for the work-study program. In addition, the pilot program reduced 
the number of jobs being occupied by student participants by requiring that 
four students share a single full-time position. The Department expects that 
its experiences under the new work-study program will be similar. It believes 
that encouraging employers to create such multiple employment opportunities for 
youth who qualify for participation in the work-study program warrants this 
flexibility. E. Logging Occupations and Occupations in the Operation of Any 
Sawmill, Lath Mill, Shingle Mill, or Cooperage Stock Mill (Order 4) (29 CFR 
570.54) HO 4 generally prohibits minors 16 and 17 years of age from being 
employed in most occupations in logging and in the operation of a sawmill, lath 
mill, shingle mill or cooperage stock mill. The HO was created because of the 
extremely high numbers of occupational fatalities and injuries that were 
experienced by workers of all ages in these industries. HO 4 currently provides 
exemptions that allow 16- and 17-year-olds to perform some occupations within 
the logging industries. Such minors may perform work in offices or repair or 
maintenance shops. They may work in the construction, operation, repair, or 
maintenance of living and administrative quarters of logging camps. They may 
work in the peeling of fence posts, pulpwood, chemical wood, excelsior wood, 
cordwood, or similar products when not done in conjunction with and at the same 
time and place as other logging occupations declared hazardous by HO 4. They 
may work in the feeding and care of animals. Finally, they may work in timber 
cruising, surveying, or logging engineering parties; in the repair or 
maintenance of roads, railroads, or flumes; and in forest protection, such as 
clearing fire trails or roads, piling and burning slash, maintaining 
fire-fighting equipment, constructing and maintaining telephone lines, or 
acting as fire lookouts or fire patrolman away from the actual logging 
operations--but only if such tasks do not involve the felling or bucking of 
timber, the collecting or transporting of logs, the operation of power-driven 
machinery, the handling or use of explosives, and working on trestles. HO 4 
also provides exemptions at Sec. 570.54(a) (old and new), permitting 16- and 
17-year-olds to be employed in certain sawmill, lath mill, shingle mill, or 
cooperage stock mill occupations. These exemptions, which do not apply to work 
performed in a portable sawmill or that entails the young worker entering the 
sawmill building, permit 16- and 17-year-olds employed in occupations in the 
operation of sawmills, lath mills, shingle mills, or cooperage stock mills to 
work in offices or in repair or maintenance shops; to straighten, mark, or 
tally lumber on the dry chain or the dry drop sorter; pull lumber from the dry 
chain; to clean up the lumberyard; to pile, handle, or ship cooperage stock in 
yards or storage sheds other than operating of or assisting in the operation of 
power-driven equipment; to perform clerical work in the yards or shipping 
sheds, such as done by ordermen, tally-men, and shipping clerks; to perform 
clean-up work outside shake and shingle mills, except when the mill is in 
operation; to split shakes manually from precut and split blocks with a froe 
and mallet, except inside the mill building or cover; to pack shakes into 
bundles when done in conjunction with splitting shakes manually with a froe and 
mallet, except inside the mill building or cover; and to manually load bundles 
of shingles or shakes into trucks or railroad cars, provided that the employer 
has on file a statement from a licensed doctor of medicine or osteopathy 
certifying the minor capable of performing this work without injury to himself. 
The NIOSH Report recommends that the Department not only retain HO 4, but 
expand its coverage to include work in the operation of timber tracts (Standard 
Industrial Classification (SIC) 081) and forestry services (SIC 085) because of 
the high number of fatalities occurring in such operations (see NIOSH Report, 
page 27). The SIC industry group of timber tracts encompasses establishments 
primarily engaged in the operation of timber tracts or tree farms for the 
purpose of selling standing timber, including those establishments that grow 
Christmas trees. The SIC industry group of forestry services encompasses 
establishments primarily engaged in performing, on a contract or fee basis, 
services related to timber production, wood technology, forestry economics and 
marketing, as well as other forestry services not contained in another SIC such 
as timber cruising, forest fire fighting, and reforestation. Establishments 
that perform timber estimation and valuation and forest fire prevention and 
pest control are also included in SIC 085. The Report states: ``The logging 
industry * * * had the highest lifetime risk of fatal injury of any industry, 
at 47 deaths per 1,000 workers based on an analysis of National Traumatic 
Occupational Fatality Surveillance System data for 1990 and 1991. Sawmills, 
planing mills, and millwork * * * had the 14th highest lifetime risk of 5.8 
deaths per 1,000 workers'' (see NIOSH Report, page 28). The Report also 
documents that the forestry industry has a high fatality rate as well, and 
workers face injury risks similar to those of logging workers. Citing data from 
the Census of Fatal Occupational Injuries (CFOI), the Report identified 82 
fatalities of workers between 1992 and 1997 employed in the forestry industry 
as a whole, which includes establishments primarily engaged in the operation of 
timber tracts, tree farms, forest nurseries and those providing related forest 
service activities such as cruising and estimating timber, reforestation, fire 
prevention and fire fighting, pest control, timber valuation, and the gathering 
of forest products. Transportation incidents were the most common fatal event 
among forestry workers, accounting for 43 of the 82 deaths (see NIOSH Report, 
page 30). Although the Report notes that there was almost no data specific to 
workers 16 and 17 years of age, the CFOI identifies 35 deaths in timber tract 
operations for all age groups between 1992 and 1997 and 39 deaths in forestry 
service operations for all age groups during the same period. Forestry workers 
also experienced fatal injuries such as those typically associated with the 
logging industry; in 26 of the 82 fatalities the worker was struck by a falling 
object (a tree in all but one instance). In addition, NIOSH also was able to 
identify 16 additional deaths of workers of all ages that were attributable to 
forest fire fighting activities (see NIOSH Report, page 30). NIOSH notes that 
work in SIC 083, forest nurseries and gathering of forest products, is 
associated with very small numbers of fatalities and should not be prohibited 
by HO 4. SIC 083 encompasses those establishments primarily engaged in growing 
trees for purposes of reforestation or in gathering forest products. The 
concentration or distillation of these products, when carried out in the 
forest, is also included [[Page 28430]] in this industry. Examples of 
industries or activities included in SIC 083 are the gathering of balsam 
needles, ginseng, huckleberry greens, maple sap, moss, Spanish moss, sphagnum 
moss, teaberries, and tree seeds; the distillation of gum, turpentine, and 
rosin if carried on at the gum farm; and the extraction of pine gum. It should 
also be noted that section 13(d) of the FLSA already provides an exemption from 
the Act's minimum wage, overtime, and child labor provisions to any homeworker 
engaged in the making of wreaths composed principally of natural holly, pine, 
cedar, or other evergreens (including the harvesting of the evergreens or other 
forest products used in making such wreaths). The Report also recommends that 
the Department remove the current exemption that permits 16- and 17-year-olds 
to work in the construction of living and administrative quarters of logging 
camps. The Report states: ``Construction work has high risks for fatal and 
nonfatal injuries and should not be exempted in the construction of living or 
administrative quarters at logging sites or mills'' (see NIOSH Report, page 
27). The Department sought public comments about this issue in the ANPRM that 
was published concurrently with the NPRM on April 17, 2007 (72 FR 19328). As 
mentioned earlier, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2004 (Pub. L. 108-199), 
amended the FLSA by creating a limited exemption from the child labor 
provisions for minors 14 to 18 years of age who are excused from compulsory 
school attendance beyond the eighth grade. The exemption, contained in section 
13(c)(7) of the FLSA, allows eligible youth, under specific conditions, to be 
employed by businesses that use machinery to process wood products, but does 
not allow such youth to operate or assist in operating power-driven woodworking 
machines. This exemption necessitates that the Department revise both Reg. 3 
and HO 4. The Department agreed with the NIOSH Report recommendation that HO 4 
should be expanded to cover work in forest fire fighting and forest fire 
prevention because of the risks inherent in those occupations. The Department 
also considered adopting NIOSH's recommendation that the employment of 16- and 
17-year-olds be prohibited in the operation of timber tracts, tree farms, and 
forestry services, but was concerned that such youth may be able to be safely 
employed in certain facets or occupations within those industries. Therefore, 
the Department requested in the NPRM that the public provide information that 
would help it identify which occupations or tasks within the timber tract, tree 
farm, and forestry services industries are not particularly hazardous to youth. 
The Department proposed to revise HO 4 to add a prohibition on the employment 
of youth 16 and 17 years of age in forest fire fighting and forest fire 
prevention occupations to the current prohibitions on logging occupations, and 
occupations in the operation of any sawmill, lath mill, shingle mill, or 
cooperage stock mill. The Department proposed to revise the title of HO 4 to 
reflect these changes. Under the proposal, all occupations in forest fire 
fighting and forest fire prevention would include the controlling and 
extinguishing of fires, the wetting down of areas or extinguishing of spot 
fires, and the patrolling of burned areas to ensure the fire has been 
extinguished. The term would also include the following tasks when performed in 
conjunction with, or in support of, efforts to extinguish a fire: The piling 
and burning of slash; the clearing of fire trails or roads; the construction, 
maintenance, and patrolling of fire lines; acting as a fire lookout or fire 
patrolman; and tasks associated with the operation of a temporary fire fighting 
base camp. The proposed prohibition concerning the employment of youth in 
forest fire fighting and forest fire prevention would apply to all forest 
locations and buildings located within the forest, not just where logging or 
sawmilling takes place. The Department notes that, because the FLSA does not 
cover individuals who volunteer to perform services for state or local 
government agencies when the provisions in section 3(e)(4) are met, this 
proposal would not prohibit 16- and 17-year-old volunteers from donating their 
forest fire fighting services to state and local governments. The Department 
also proposed to incorporate into HO 4 the provisions of the Consolidated 
Appropriations Act, 2004 (Pub. L. 108- 199), which amended the FLSA by creating 
a limited exemption from the child labor provisions for certain minors 14 
through 17 years of age who are excused from compulsory school attendance 
beyond the eighth grade. The exemption, contained at section 13(c)(7) of the 
FLSA, overrides the HO 4 prohibition against 16- and 17-year-olds performing 
any work in the sawmill industry that entails entering the sawmill building by 
permitting certain youth to be employed inside and outside of places of 
business where machinery is used to process wood products. The Department 
proposed to revise HO 4 to incorporate the provisions of section 13(c)(7) in 
the same manner, and using the same definitions and interpretations, as it 
proposed when discussing revisions to Reg. 3, above. The term all occupations 
in the operation of any sawmill, lath mill, shingle mill, or cooperage stock 
mill, as defined by HO 4, specifically excludes work performed in the 
planing-mill department or other remanufacturing departments of any sawmill, or 
in any planing mill or remanufacturing plant not a part of a sawmill. Although 
not defined in the regulations, the Department has, since at least 1942, 
considered the term remanufacturing departments to mean those departments of a 
sawmill where lumber products such as boxes, lawn furniture, and the like are 
remanufactured from previously cut lumber. The kind of work performed in such 
departments is similar to that done in planing mill departments in that rough 
lumber is surfaced or made into other finished products. The term is not 
intended to denote those operations in sawmills where rough lumber is cut to 
dimensions. Because the Department has, over the years, received requests for 
clarification as to the meaning of remanufacturing departments, it proposed to 
add the above definition to HO 4. The Department also proposed to revise HO 4 
to include all the definitions necessitated by the incorporation of the 
provisions of FLSA section 13(c)(7) as discussed earlier in this document. In 
addition, the Department proposed to restructure all the definitions in HO 4 in 
an alphabetical sequence to comport with guidance provided by the Federal 
Register. The Department decided not to address, in the NPRM, the NIOSH Report 
recommendation to remove the HO 4 exemption that permits 16- and 17-year-olds 
to work in the construction of living and administrative quarters of logging 
camps. This is because the Report also recommended the creation of a new HO 
that would prohibit all work in construction occupations which, if adopted, 
would impact the provisions of not only HO 4 but several other HOs. The 
Department believes additional information is needed before it can address such 
a broad recommendation that would impact all construction occupations. In an 
attempt to obtain such additional information, the Department requested public 
comment on this subject in the 2007 ANPRM. The Department received five 
comments addressing this proposal. The DOLWD stated it was in agreement with 
[[Page 28431]] the NIOSH recommendations, except that it believed that 16- and 
17- year-olds, after completion of the ten-hour construction safety and health 
course certified by OSHA, could safely be employed to work in the construction 
of living and administrative quarters of logging camps. The DOLWD also 
recommended that an exception be granted allowing such youth ``to be employed 
in logging camp support positions such as cook, janitor, etc.'' The Director of 
Human Capital Management of the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Forest Service 
stated that the Forest Service applauded the Department of Labor's proposal 
that would prohibit 16- and 17-year- olds from performing fire fighting duties. 
The Forest Service did, however, recommend that the proposal be revised to 
permit such youth to work in forest protection-type activities, which it sees 
as non- hazardous, such as clearing fire trails or roads, maintaining fire 
fighting equipment, and acting as a fire lookout or fire patrolman. The Forest 
Service also noted that it ``currently uses 16- and 17-year-old Job Corps 
employees and private contractors in our fire camps to perform such tasks as 
building platforms for tents, stocking commissary items, performing timekeeping 
activities and providing food services.'' The AFL-CIO, YWN, and CLC all 
supported the proposed changes to prohibit the employment of young workers in 
forest fire fighting and forest fire prevention occupations. All three also 
expressed their disappointment that although the Department considered adopting 
NIOSH's recommendation that the employment of 16- and 17-year-olds be 
prohibited in the operation of timber tracts, tree farms, and forestry 
services, it did not do so. All three commenters provided rationales for 
adopting this NIOSH recommendation, which included examples of tasks and 
exposures commonly associated with such industries that they consider to be 
hazardous. For example, the AFL-CIO noted that ``[w]orking in the forest 
industry can involve working at heights * * * These workers also cut the trees 
with a chainsaw and drag them from the cutting area to a truck and then load 
them on to a truck. The AFL-CIO strongly urges DOL not to permit children under 
18 to do any of this work. Other forestry workers gather products which 
requires them to climb trees * * * children under 18 should not be able to work 
at heights in timber tracts or tree farms.'' The CLC commented that ``[w]orking 
in the forestry industry can involve working at heights * * * using machetes 
and pruning shears * * * These workers also cut the trees with a chainsaw and 
drag them from the cutting area and then load them on to a truck. The CLC 
strongly urges DOL not to permit children under 18 to do any of this work, much 
of which is already prohibited.'' Finally, the YWN, AFL-CIO, and the CLC all 
encouraged the Department to revise its proposal and accept the NIOSH 
recommendation to prohibit the employment of 16- and 17-year-olds in the 
constructing and repairing of living or administrative quarters of logging 
camps. The CLC also argued that language in the proposed HO 4 is changed from 
the current rule and contradicts itself in that Sec. 570.54(a) declares all 
occupations in logging to be particularly hazardous; that the definition of all 
occupations in logging contained in Sec. 570.54(b) includes the constructing, 
repairing, and maintaining of camps used in connection with logging; and Sec. 
570.54(a)(1)(ii) permits youth to perform such work. The Department has 
carefully reviewed all the comments and has decided to adopt the proposal with 
certain modifications that will clarify the Final Rule. First, the Department 
has been persuaded by the comments of the Forest Service and the DOLWD that 16- 
and 17-year-olds can safely be employed in certain capacities in forest 
protection and in the operation of fire fighting base camps. The Department now 
concurs that employment at such camps, which are purposely located considerable 
distances from forest fires, when in compliance with all other Hazardous 
Occupations Orders, is not particularly hazardous or detrimental to the health 
or well-being of 16- and 17-year-olds. Such employment is very similar to that 
involved with the operation of logging camps, occupations that 16- and 
17-year-olds have been permitted to perform for many years. Accordingly, the 
Department has revised the regulatory language in Sec. 570.54(a)(2). The Final 
Rule also provides that 16- and 17-year-olds may perform such fire prevention 
tasks as the clearing of fire trails or roads; the construction, maintenance, 
and patrolling of fire lines; the maintaining of fire fighting equipment; 
acting as a fire lookout or fire patrolman; and the piling and burning of 
slash. However, such tasks are permitted only when not performed in conjunction 
with extinguishing a forest fire. The Department believes the hazards 
associated with the activities of extinguishing a forest fire warrant this 
prohibition and has clarified the definition of all occupations in forest fire 
fighting and forest fire prevention to note that such work is prohibited not 
only in all forest and timber tract locations, but also in logging operations, 
and sawmill operations, including all buildings located within such areas. The 
revisions the Department proposed to Sec. 570.54(a)(1) (old) that removed 
paragraph (iii) of that subsection evidenced the Department's intention to 
prohibit 16- and 17-year-olds from employment in most timber tract and forestry 
service occupations. The previous Sec. 570.54(a)(1)(iii) specifically excluded 
from the list of logging tasks deemed to be particularly hazardous to young 
workers who work in timber cruising, surveying or logging-engineering parties; 
work in the repair or maintenance of roads, railroads, or flumes; and work in 
forest protection, such as clearing fire trails or roads, piling and burning 
slash, maintaining fire-fighting equipment, constructing and maintaining 
telephone lines, or acting as fire look-out or fire patrolman away from the 
actual logging operation. By removing this subsection, the Department removes 
the exception for timber tract and forestry service occupations. The 
Department, in its 2007 NPRM, specifically requested public comments as to 
which occupations or tasks within the timber tract, tree farm, and forestry 
service industries, if any, are not particularly hazardous or detrimental to 
the health and well-being of youth (see 72 FR 19351). It was the Department's 
intention to qualify in the Final Rule which occupations, if any, would be 
permitted for 16- and 17-year- olds after the comments were reviewed. No 
comments were received that identified any tasks in these industries as being 
safe for minors to perform. The Department believes that despite the lack of 
comments, 16- and 17-year-olds can safely perform certain tasks within the 
timber tract, tree farm, and forestry service industries. Such youth should be 
permitted to perform many of the tasks that HO 4 has long permitted youth 
employed in logging to perform: Working in offices and in repair or maintenance 
shops; work in the construction, operation, repair, or maintenance of living 
and administrative quarters, constructing and maintaining telephone lines; and 
work in the feeding or care of animals. In addition, youth employed in timber 
tract, tree farm, and forestry service industries should be permitted to 
perform tasks related to forest marketing and forest economics that are not 
performed in a forest. Finally, as mentioned above, such youth should also be 
permitted to perform certain tasks related to forest fire fighting and [[Page 
28432]] forest fire prevention, when not performed in conjunction with the 
extinguishing of a fire, such as the clearing of trails or roads; the 
construction, maintenance, and patrolling of fire lines; acting as a fire 
lookout or fire patrolman; and tasks associated with the operation of a fire 
fighting base camp. The Department has revised the regulatory language proposed 
in the NPRM for HO 4 at Sec. 570.54(a) to make it clear that the employment of 
16- and 17-year-olds to perform most jobs in timber tract, forestry service, 
and tree farm operations are prohibited. The revisions also simplify the 
section by combining, clarifying, and condensing previous subsections. The 
Department notes that the use of Standard Industrial Codes by the NIOSH Report 
was helpful in identifying the different occupations and industries that could 
be impacted by the Department's HO. But because many of the occupations and 
tasks addressed by the Final Rule either appear in more than one code or are 
not included in the codes listed in the Report, the Department did not use 
those codes in formulating the definitions used in the Final Rule. The 
Department has added language to Sec. 570.54(a) to make it clear that the 
limited exceptions to HO 4 listed in that paragraph do not include any work 
that would be prohibited by any other HO contained in subpart E. The Department 
also added clarifying statements to Sec. 570.54(a)(8) regarding the types of 
work that 14-year-olds employed under the provisions of FLSA section 13(c)(7) 
may perform inside a sawmill. As discussed earlier, similar clarifying language 
was added to Sec. 570.34(m)(2). The Department has also moved the definition of 
portable sawmill contained within Sec. 570.54(a)(2) (old) to the Definitions 
section (Sec. 570.54(b) (new)). In addition to changing the title of HO 4 to 
accommodate this revision, the Department has also added definitions of the 
terms all occupations in forestry services and all occupations in timber tracts 
to Sec. 570.54(b). The Department has also replaced the words firefighting and 
firelines in the Final Rule with the words fire fighting and fire lines. All 
occupations in forestry services shall mean all work involved in the support of 
timber production, wood technology, forestry economics and marketing, and 
forest protection. The term includes such services as timber cruising, 
surveying, or logging-engineering parties; estimating timber; timber valuation; 
forest pest control; forest fire fighting and forest fire prevention as defined 
in this section; and reforestation. The term shall not include work in forest 
nurseries, establishments primarily engaged in growing trees for purposes of 
reforestation. The term shall not include the gathering of forest products such 
as balsam needles, ginseng, huckleberry greens, maple sap, moss, Spanish moss, 
sphagnum moss, teaberries, and tree seeds; the distillation of gum, turpentine, 
and rosin if carried on at the gum farm; and the extraction of pine gum. All 
occupations in timber tracts means all work performed in or about 
establishments that cultivate, manage or sell standing timber. The term 
includes work performed in timber culture, timber tracts, timber-stand 
improvement, and forest fire fighting and fire prevention. It would also 
include work on tree farms, except those tree farm establishments that meet the 
definition of agriculture contained in 29 U.S.C. 203(f). F. Occupations 
Involved in the Operation of Power-Driven Wood Working Machines (Order 5) (29 
CFR 570.55) HO 5 generally prohibits the employment of 16- and 17-year-olds in 
occupations involving the operating, setting up, adjusting, repairing, oiling, 
or cleaning of power-driven woodworking machines. It also prohibits the 
occupations of off-bearing from circular saws and from guillotine-action veneer 
clippers. As previously mentioned, FLSA section 13(c)(7) now permits certain 
minors who are at least 14 years of age and under the age of 18 years to be 
employed inside and outside of places of business where machinery is used to 
process wood products, but does not allow such youth to operate or assist in 
operating power- driven woodworking machines. The term power-driven woodworking 
machines has long been defined in Sec. 570.55(b) to mean all fixed or portable 
machines or tools driven by power and used or designed for cutting, shaping, 
forming, surfacing, nailing, stapling, wire stitching, fastening, or otherwise 
assembling, pressing, or printing wood or veneer. Although FLSA section 
13(c)(7) does not impact the prohibitions of HO 5 because eligible youth are 
still prevented from operating power-driven woodworking machinery, it does 
expand the types of workplaces where certain youth may be employed to include 
sawmills, lath mills, shingle mills, and cooperage stock mills as well as other 
workplaces the Department's Final Rule includes under Reg. 3 and HO 4. 
Employees at these newly permitted work sites routinely use power-driven 
equipment that process materials that may not be included in the current 
definition of power-driven woodworking machines contained in HO 5, such as 
trees, logs, and lumber. Accordingly, the Department proposed to amend the 
definition of power- driven woodworking machines to include those machines that 
process trees, logs, and lumber. To ensure consistency, the Department proposed 
that this single definition of power-driven woodworking machines be included in 
Sec. 570.34(m) (Reg. 3), Sec. 570.54 (HO 4), and Sec. 570.55 (HO 5). The 
Department also proposed to restructure the two definitions in this section to 
reflect an alphabetical sequence in accordance with guidance provided by the 
Federal Register. The Department received three comments on this proposal. The 
AFL- CIO and YWN agreed with the Department's proposal to amend the definition 
of power-driven woodworking machines to include those machines that process 
trees, logs, and lumber. The YWN also recommended that the proposed definition 
of power-driven woodworking machines be revised to permit 16- and 17-year-olds 
to use small hand-held battery- operated drills that accommodate bits no larger 
than \3/8\'' and hand- held oscillating- or vibrating-type sanders. The CLC, 
YWN, and AFL-CIO expressed disappointment that the Department did not adopt 
NIOSH's alternative recommendation that the Department rewrite HOs 5, 8, and 
12, which respectively address machines that work with wood, metal, and paper, 
by merging them into a single or multiple HOs which address the function of the 
machines rather than the material processed (see NIOSH Report, page 31). After 
carefully reviewing the comments, the Department has decided to adopt the 
proposal as written. The Department did not request, nor does it possess, data 
regarding whether 16- and 17-year-olds can safely operate portable drills or 
sanders, or what requirements should be imposed to ensure their safe operation 
by young workers. Accordingly, it cannot adopt the recommendation of the YWN at 
this time. The Department notes that it is exploring the feasibility of 
adopting NIOSH's alternative recommendation that certain power-driven equipment 
be prohibited based on function rather than on the material being processed. 
Because of the complexity of the issue and in the hopes of obtaining additional 
information, the Department requested public comment on this recommendation in 
the ANPRM that [[Page 28433]] was published in conjunction with, and on the 
same day as, the NPRM. G. Occupations Involved in the Operation of Power-Driven 
Hoisting Apparatus (Order 7) (29 CFR 570.58) HO 7 generally prohibits 16- and 
17-year-olds from employment in occupations that involve the work of: (1) 
Operating an elevator, crane, derrick, hoist, or high-lift truck except such 
youth may operate unattended automatic operation passenger elevators and 
electric or air operated hoists not exceeding one ton capacity; (2) riding on a 
manlift or on a freight elevator, except a freight elevator operated by an 
assigned operator; and (3) assisting in the operation of a crane, derrick or 
hoist performed by crane hookers, crane chasers, hookers-on, riggers, rigger 
helpers, and like occupations. The NIOSH Report recommended that the Department 
expand HO 7 to prohibit the repairing, servicing, and disassembling of the 
machines and assisting in tasks being performed by the machines named in the 
HO. Assisting in tasks being performed by the machines would be tending the 
machines. The Report shows that a substantial number of deaths and injuries are 
associated with operating and assisting in tasks performed by power-driven 
hoisting apparatus, including deaths of youth (see NIOSH Report, page 36). 
Additionally, a considerable number of deaths were associated with activities 
not directly related to operation of the hoisting apparatus, notably servicing, 
repairing, and disassembling. Currently, the work of repairing, servicing, 
disassembling, and tending the machines covered by HO 7 is prohibited to 14- 
and 15-year-olds under Reg. 3 at Sec. 570.33(b) (old) and Sec. 570.33(c) (new). 
Under HO 7, 16- and 17-year-olds may currently perform such work, except they 
may not assist in the operation of a crane, derrick, or hoist as defined by the 
HO. The Report also recommends that HO 7 be expanded to prohibit youth from 
riding on any part of a forklift as a passenger (including the forks) and from 
working from forks, platforms, buckets, or cages attached to a moving or 
stationary forklift. The Report notes that substantial numbers of fatalities 
occur among workers who are passengers on forklifts, riding on the forks, or 
working from the raised forklift attachments (see NIOSH Report, page 36). 
Currently, 14- and 15-year-olds are prohibited from riding on forklifts because 
Reg. 3 prohibits such youth from operating or tending hoisting apparatus and 
any power-driven machines other than office equipment. The Department has long 
interpreted tending to include riding upon the power-driven equipment. HO 7, 
however, prohibits older youth only from operating high-lift trucks such as 
forklifts. Since 1999, the WHD has investigated at least three incidents where 
youth under 18 years of age were seriously injured while riding on forklifts 
being operated by other employees. One 16-year-old who was riding on the tines 
of a forklift suffered especially serious injuries to his liver and pancreas as 
a result of being pinned against a wall when the driver was unable to stop the 
forklift. The Report also recommends that HO 7 be expanded to prohibit work 
from truck-mounted bucket or basket hoists commonly termed ``bucket trucks'' or 
``cherry pickers'' because worker fatalities are associated with work from such 
equipment (see NIOSH Report, page 36). The Report specifically notes the risk 
of falls and electrocution being linked with such equipment. The Report, citing 
CFOI data, reflects that there were 99 worker deaths associated with truck 
mounted bucket or basket hoists between 1992 and 1997 (see NIOSH Report, page 
37). In addition, the Report recommends that HO 7 be expanded to prohibit 16- 
and 17-year-olds from employment involving certain commonly used 
manlifts--especially aerial platforms--that do not meet the current definition 
of manlift contained in the HO. The Report contends that such manlifts appear 
to pose more significant injury risk than those traditionally prohibited by HO 
7 (see NIOSH Report, page 36). HO 7 defines a manlift as a device intended for 
the conveyance of persons that consists of platforms or brackets mounted on, or 
attached to, an endless belt, cable, chain or similar method of suspension; 
such belt, cable or chain operating in a substantially vertical direction and 
being supported by and driven through pulleys, sheaves or sprockets at the top 
and bottom. The Report is correct that this current definition of manlift does 
not include, and therefore does not prohibit, 16- and 17-year-olds from 
operating or tending aerial platforms and other manlifts such as scissor lifts, 
boom-type mobile elevating work platforms, work assist vehicles, cherry 
pickers, basket hoists, and bucket trucks. The Report also recommends that HO 7 
be revised to eliminate the exemption that permits 16- and 17-year-olds to 
operate an electric or air-operated hoist not exceeding one-ton capacity. The 
Report states that current injury and fatality surveillance systems do not 
provide sufficient detail to justify this exemption. ``A hoisted load weighing 
less than one ton has the potential to cause injury or death as a result of 
falling, or being improperly rigged or handled. Hoist-related fatalities of 
young workers have been reported, including a recent case in which a youth was 
killed while operating a half-ton capacity hoist'' (see NIOSH Report, page 36). 
The Department proposed to implement all five of the Report recommendations 
concerning HO 7. Sections 570.58(a)(1) and (a)(2) would be revised to reflect 
that in addition to work involved with operating the named equipment, the work 
of tending, riding upon, working from, servicing, repairing or disassembling 
such equipment would also be prohibited. Section 570.58(a)(3) would be 
eliminated because its provisions would now be contained in the revised Sec. 
570.58(a)(1). The work of assisting in the operation of a crane, derrick, or 
hoist would be prohibited because such tasks fall within the scope of tending 
of equipment. The exemption contained in Sec. 570.58(a)(1) permitting youth to 
operate and ride inside passenger elevators would be retained, but the 
exemption that currently allows 16- and 17-year-olds to operate an electric or 
air-operated hoist not exceeding one ton capacity would be eliminated as per 
the Report recommendation. The Department also proposed to reformat the 
definitions section contained in HO 7 to reflect an alphabetical sequence in 
accordance with guidance provided by the Federal Register. In addition, the 
Department proposed to revise the definition of manlift so that, as recommended 
by the Report, it incorporates those pieces of equipment that perform the same 
functions as manlifts but that do not currently fall within the prohibitions of 
the HO. The proposed definition included a statement that the term manlift 
shall also include truck- or equipment-mounted aerial platforms commonly 
referred to as scissor lifts, boom-type mobile elevating work platforms, work 
assist vehicles, cherry pickers, basket hoists, and bucket trucks. The 
Department also proposed to revise the definition of high-lift truck to 
incorporate a long-standing enforcement position that industrial trucks such as 
skid loaders, skid-steer loaders, and Bobcat loaders are high-lift trucks as 
defined by HO 7. Although not specifically named as high-lift trucks in the 
current HO 7, such equipment meets the definition of high-lift trucks because 
each is ``a power-driven industrial type of truck * * * equipped with a power- 
operated lifting device * * * capable of [[Page 28434]] tiering loaded pallets 
or skids one above the other.'' The Department has opined on this matter, in 
writing, since at least 1993. By adding skid loaders, skid-steer loaders, and 
Bobcat loaders to the definition of high-lift trucks, the Department believes 
it will clarify the requirements for compliance with HO 7. The Department has 
successfully defended this enforcement position, most recently in a case where 
minors were employed to operate a skid-steer loader to clean trailers used to 
haul livestock. In addition to affirming the Department's position that a skid 
loader was a ``high-lift truck'' within the meaning of HO 7, the court also 
found that the youths' operation of the equipment violated the HO even though 
the youth did not operate or utilize the loader's hoisting device but used the 
skid-steer loader as a ``scraper'' (see Lynnville Transport, Inc. v. Chao, 316 
F. Supp. 2d 790 (S.D. Iowa 2004)). The Department received three comments on 
this proposal. The YWN, AFL-CIO, and CLC supported all elements of the 
proposal, with additional recommendations. The YWN and AFL-CIO suggested that 
HO 7 be expanded to prohibit 16- and 17-year-olds from working with hydraulic 
grease racks, though the YWN recommended that an exception be made to permit 
automotive repair students in cooperative education programs who have been 
properly trained and receive appropriate supervision to ``work around these 
racks'' but not to operate them. The YWN also noted that ``back hoes'' and 
``front-end-loaders'' would fall within the definition of high-lift trucks and 
recommended, for the sake of clarity, that the Department specifically name 
them in the revised Sec. 570.58(b). The CLC noted that the NIOSH Report 
recommended that HO 7 prohibit 16- and 17-year-olds from employment that, among 
other things, included ``assisting in tasks being performed'' by the 
power-driven hoisting equipment. The CLC took issue with the Department's 
statement that assisting in tasks being performed by the machines would 
constitute tending--an activity prohibited by the proposal. The CLC recommended 
that the Department clarify the proposal by specifically adding ``assisting in 
tasks being performed by the equipment'' to the language of the Final Rule. The 
importance of this recommendation was poignantly demonstrated by the August 
2008 death of a 17-year-old in Georgia who was crushed to death when a one-ton 
electrical inverter box fell from a fork lift. The minor was not operating the 
forklift at the time of his death but was serving as a ``spotter'' and 
assisting the operator of the forklift. The Department appreciates the comments 
of the YWN, AFL-CIO, and CLC and has decided to adopt the proposal with slight 
modifications designed for clarification. The Department will add backhoes and 
front- end loaders to the examples of high-lift trucks contained in Sec. 
570.58(b) as recommended by the YWN. The Department will also clarify in Sec. 
570.58(a)(1) and (2) that the term tending includes assisting in the hoisting 
tasks being performed by the equipment, to add clarity as recommended by the 
CLC. The Department believes additional information is needed before it can 
determine whether 16- and 17-year-olds who operate hydraulic grease racks are 
at risk and notes it requested public comment on this issue in 2007. 
Accordingly, adoption of the recommendations of the YWN and AFL-CIO that HO 7 
also prohibit the operation of such equipment would be premature. H. 
Occupations in the Operation of Power-Driven Meat-Processing Machines and 
Occupations Involving Slaughtering, Meat Packing or Processing, or Rendering 
(Order 10) (29 CFR 570.61) HO 10 generally prohibits 16- and 17-year-olds from 
being employed in all occupations in or about slaughtering, meat packing or 
processing establishments, and rendering plants. The HO also prevents such 
minors from performing all occupations involved in the operation or feeding of 
several power-driven meat processing machines when performed in slaughtering 
and meat packing establishments, as well as in wholesale, retail, or service 
establishments. The term slaughtering and meat packing establishments is 
defined in HO 10 to mean places in which cattle, calves, hogs, sheep, lambs, 
goats, or horses are killed, butchered, or processed. The term also includes 
establishments that manufacture or process meat products or sausage casing from 
such animals. Under the existing regulation, the term does not include 
establishments that process only poultry, rabbits, or small game. The term 
retail/wholesale or service establishments, as defined in HO 10, includes 
establishments where meat or meat products are processed or handled, such as 
butcher shops, grocery stores, restaurants, quick service establishments, 
hotels, delicatessens, and meat locker (freezer-locker) companies, and 
establishments where any food product is prepared or processed for serving to 
customers using machines prohibited by the HO. Included on the list of 
prohibited power-driven meat processing machines are meat patty forming 
machines, meat and bone cutting saws, meat slicers, knives (except 
bacon-slicing machines), headsplitters, and guillotine cutters; snoutpullers 
and jawpullers; skinning machines; horizontal rotary washing machines; 
casing-cleaning machines such as crushing, stripping, and finishing machines; 
grinding, mixing, chopping, and hashing machines; and presses (except belly- 
rolling machines). The term operation includes setting-up, adjusting, 
repairing, oiling, or cleaning such machines, regardless of the product being 
processed by the machine. For example, HO 10 prohibits a minor from operating a 
meat slicer in a restaurant to cut cheese or vegetables. In addition, the 
Department has, as early as 1991, interpreted the prohibition on cleaning such 
machines as precluding 16- and 17-year-olds from performing the hand or machine 
washing of parts of and attachments to power-driven meat processing machines, 
even when the machine was disassembled and reassembled by an adult. This 
provision is designed to prevent such youth from being injured by contact with 
the machines' sharp blades and cutting surfaces. HO 10 provides a limited 
exemption that permits the employment of apprentices and student-learners under 
the conditions prescribed in Sec. 570.50(b) and (c). The NIOSH Report 
recommends that HO 10 be expanded to prohibit work in all meat products 
manufacturing industries including those engaged in the processing of sausages 
and/or other prepared meat products and those engaged in poultry slaughtering 
and/or processing (see NIOSH Report, page 41). The rationale for this 
recommendation is that although injury fatality rates in meat products 
manufacturing industries are relatively low, rates of disorders due to repeated 
trauma are extremely high. This is also true for poultry processing which is 
not encompassed in the existing HO. In addition, there are a number of diverse 
and serious health hazards associated with the slaughtering of animals and 
manufacturing of meat products, including exposure to infectious agents and 
respiratory hazards. The Report notes that in 1997 there were an estimated 
13,646 occupational injuries and illnesses resulting in days away from work 
among employees in the meat products manufacturing industry. Although the 
greatest number of these injuries and illnesses occurred in meat packing [[Page 
28435]] plants (5,526), establishments that produce sausages and prepared meats 
experienced 4,147 injuries and illnesses, and poultry slaughtering and 
processing establishments experienced 3,937 that same year (see NIOSH Report, 
page 43). In 1999, the Department investigated the death of a young poultry 
processing worker in Arkansas and the serious injury of a similarly employed 
minor in Missouri who injured both of his legs when he slipped and fell into an 
auger. The minor also suffered severe nerve damage and second degree burns. The 
Report also recommends that HO 10 be revised to allow 16- and 17-year-olds to 
operate and feed power-driven meat and food slicers in retail, wholesale and 
service industry establishments. This is one of the few recommendations the 
Report makes that would relax current prohibitions, and it is made with the 
rationale that ``although data show high numbers of injuries associated with 
power-driven slicers, the injuries appear to be relatively minor.'' NIOSH 
includes the caveat that if this recommendation is implemented ``it should be 
accompanied by a mandatory reporting period in which all serious youth injuries 
and deaths resulting from previously prohibited activities are promptly 
reported to the U.S. Department of Labor.'' Such a reporting plan would allow 
an assessment as to whether the revision should be rescinded or further refined 
to best protect working youth (see NIOSH Report, page 48). Finally, the Report 
recommends that the apprenticeship and student- learner exemption contained in 
HO 10 be restricted to apply only to 16- and 17-year-olds employed in retail, 
wholesale, and service industries. The Report recommends that this exemption no 
longer be applicable to the employment of such minors in meat products 
manufacturing industries. The Department proposed to implement the Report 
recommendation to expand the application of HO 10 to prohibit the employment of 
16- and 17-year-olds in all meat products manufacturing industries, including 
those engaged in the processing of sausages and/or other prepared meat products 
and those engaged in poultry slaughtering and/or processing. The Department 
proposed to revise the term slaughtering and meat packing establishments 
contained in Sec. 570.61(b) so that the term also includes places where poultry 
are killed, butchered, or processed. This term would also include 
establishments that manufacture or process meat products, including poultry, 
sausage, or sausage casings. The Department also proposed to add buffalo and 
deer to the lists of animals contained in the definitions of the terms killing 
floor and slaughtering and meat packing establishments and to note that these 
lists are not exhaustive. The Department also proposed to revise the title of 
HO 10 to reflect its expansion to the slaughtering of poultry, and the 
processing, packing, and rendering of poultry and poultry products. The current 
HO 10 exemption permitting the killing and processing of rabbits or small game 
in areas physically separated from the killing floor would not be changed. The 
Department also proposed to revise Sec. 570.61(a)(4) to incorporate its 
interpretation that the prohibition against 16- and 17- year-olds cleaning 
power-driven meat processing machines extends to washing the machine's parts 
and attachments, even if the machine is disassembled and reassembled by an 
adult. This proposal, however, would not prevent a 16- or 17-year-old from 
operating a commercial dishwasher to run a self-contained rack containing parts 
of or attachments to a power-driven meat processing machine through the 
dishwasher so long as the youth does not actually handle or touch the machine 
parts or attachments. The Department also proposed to reformat, in an 
alphabetical sequence, all the definitions found in Sec. 570.61(b) to comport 
with guidance provided by the Federal Register. The Department decided not to 
propose implementation of the Report recommendation that would allow 16- and 
17-year-olds to operate and feed power-driven meat and food slicers in retail, 
wholesale and service industry establishments. Both the Report and the 
Department's enforcement experience reflect that meat slicers are responsible 
for many occupational injuries. The Report notes that the Survey of 
Occupational Injuries and Illnesses reports that in 1997, food and beverage 
processing machinery were responsible for 11,737 nonfatal injuries and illness 
that resulted in days away from work. Over sixty percent of that number, 7,280 
injuries and illnesses, were caused by food slicers. The median number of days 
away from work for workers who suffered food slicer related injuries or 
illnesses was four days, not an insignificant number (see NIOSH Report, page 
47). Since October 1999, the Department has investigated at least 36 injuries 
of young workers that were caused by operating or cleaning power-driven meat 
slicers. Although none of these injuries were life threatening, most were 
considered to be serious and many caused the partial loss of digits and will 
leave some permanent scarring. The Department also decided not to propose 
implementation at this time of the Report recommendation concerning limiting 
the current apprenticeship and student-learner exemption contained in HO 10 to 
retail, wholesale and service industries. The apprenticeship and student 
learner exemptions contained in certain HOs were developed relatively 
independently of each other as each HO was adopted. The issue of allowing 
certain training exemptions from the HOs first arose in the early 1940s, after 
the enactment of the first six HOs. HO 5 was amended to permit the employment 
of student learners and apprentices, but HOs 1 through 4 were not. Each 
committee convened thereafter to study, draft, and implement a new HO developed 
its own criteria for determining the appropriateness of including apprentice 
and student- learner exemptions and was not restricted by the determinations 
made by previous committees. The Report makes several recommendations 
concerning the establishment, revision, and elimination of apprenticeship and 
student-learner exemptions, but the rationale for each recommendation either is 
vague or is not provided. The Department believes that before any changes to 
the existing exemptions are made, it is important to consider and develop 
criteria for determining when apprenticeship and student-learner exemptions are 
appropriate. Such criteria, which must be consistent with the established 
national policy of balancing the benefits of employment opportunities for youth 
with the necessary and most effective safety protections, will also be of value 
as the Department considers creating new HOs. Accordingly, the Department 
issued an ANPRM, in conjunction with and on the same day as the NPRM, to 
solicit public comment on this important issue. The Department received six 
comments in response to this proposal. The AFL-CIO, YWN, and CLC supported the 
proposal to expand the scope of HO 10 to prohibit the employment of 16- and 
17-year-olds in or about places where such animals as cattle, calves, hogs, 
poultry, sheep, lambs, goats, buffalo, deer, or horses are killed, butchered, 
or processed and where sausage and sausage casings are manufactured or 
processed. The Department received no comments opposing adoption of this 
portion of the proposal. The YWN also recommended that HO 10 be expanded to 
cover seafood processing occupations. The AFL-CIO, YWN, CLC and Six Flags all 
supported the Department's decision not to accept the NIOSH [[Page 28436]] 
Report's recommendation to allow 16- and 17-year-olds to operate and feed 
power-driven meat and food slicers in retail, wholesale and service industry 
establishments. These four commenters also supported the Department's proposal 
regarding the cleaning of such equipment. The FMI and the Council both 
recommended that the Department reconsider and adopt the NIOSH recommendation 
that would allow 16- and 17-year-olds to operate and feed power-driven meat and 
food slicers. The Council stated ``[t]he NIOSH recommendation appears 
well-supported'' while the FMI believed the Department's position to be 
``surprising as the NIOSH recommendations are based on the hard data and 
analysis that DOL asked NIOSH to provide.'' Neither the Council nor the FMI 
commented on the Department's proposal regarding the cleaning of power-driven 
meat processing equipment. Both the YWN and the CLC disagreed with the 
Department's decision not to implement at this time the NIOSH Report 
recommendation to limit the student-learner and apprentice exemption contained 
in HO 10 to retail, wholesale, and service industries. After carefully 
reviewing the comments, the Department has decided to implement the proposal as 
written with the following modifications. The Department is adding poultry 
scissors and shears to the list of prohibited power-driven meat processing 
machines listed in Sec. 570.61(a)(4) in recognition that the HO now covers 
poultry processing. The Department is also revising Sec. 570.61(a)(7), which 
for many years has prohibited 16- and 17-year-olds from handlifting or 
handcarrying any carcass or half carcass of beef, pork or horse, to include 
carcasses or half carcasses of buffalo and deer. This revision would also 
expand the current prohibitions involving quarter carcasses of beef and horse 
to include buffalo. These revisions are necessitated by the expansion of the 
prohibitions of HO 10 to include the processing of such animals. Finally, the 
Department is adding a statement to Sec. 570.61(a)(4) to clarify that the 
limited exemption to HO 11 which permits 16- and 17-year-olds to operate 
certain lightweight, small capacity, portable counter-top power-driven food 
mixers (see Sec. 570.62(b)(1)) would not apply when the equipment is 
adapted--through the use of various attachments--to perform functions other 
than mixing, or to process meat or poultry products because of the prohibitions 
of HO 10. This modification is discussed in more detail further in the section 
of this preamble that addresses HO 11. The Department appreciates the concerns 
of the FMI and the Council, but must reiterate that the number and severity of 
occupational injuries suffered by youth who operate or clean power-driven meat 
slicers do not justify allowing youth to operate or clean such equipment. The 
Department notes that, since publishing the NPRM, it has investigated the 
serious injuries of at least ten more young workers who operated or cleaned 
such equipment. The Department also recognizes the concerns of the YWN and CLC 
over the Department's decision not to limit the student-learner and apprentice 
exemption contained in HO 10 at this time. As noted in the NPRM, the Department 
believes that before any changes to the existing student-learner and apprentice 
exemptions are made, it is important to consider and develop criteria for 
determining when student-learner and apprentice exemptions are appropriate. As 
mentioned, the Department issued an ANPRM, in conjunction with and on the same 
day as the NPRM, to solicit public comment on this important issue. The 
Department appreciates the YWN's recommendation that HO 10 should be expanded 
to cover seafood processing occupations, but notes that no data was submitted 
regarding the level of youth employment in that industry or the injury rates 
experienced by that industry. I. Occupations Involved in the Operation of 
Bakery Machines (Order 11) (29 CFR 570.62) HO 11 generally prohibits the 
employment of 16- and 17-year-olds in occupations involved in the operation of 
power-driven bakery machines. Prohibited activities include operating, 
assisting to operate, setting up, adjusting, repairing, oiling, or cleaning any 
horizontal or vertical dough mixer; batter mixer; bread dividing, rounding, or 
molding machine; dough brake; dough sheeter; combination bread slicing and 
wrapping machine; or cake cutting band saw. The HO also prohibits the 
employment of such youth in the occupation of setting up or adjusting a 
``cooky'' or cracker machine. The prohibitions of the HO do not differentiate 
between portable and non-portable equipment, and models designed for use in the 
home versus those solely designed for industrial applications. Therefore, the 
prohibitions of HO 11 include the employment of 16- and 17-year-olds to operate 
even the smallest of counter-top vertical mixers. In response to information 
presented by several restaurants and employer associations, the Department 
adopted an enforcement position in 1990 that it would not assert a violation of 
HO 11 when a 16- or 17- year-old employee operated a pizza-dough roller, a type 
of dough sheeter, when the machine: (1) Is constructed with safeguards 
contained in the basic design so as to prevent fingers, hands, or clothing from 
being caught in the in-running point of the rollers; (2) has gears that are 
completely enclosed; and (3) has microswitches that disengage the machinery if 
the backs or sides of the rollers are removed. This enforcement position 
applies only when all the safeguards detailed above are present on the machine, 
are operational, and have not been overridden. In addition, this enforcement 
position applies only to the operation of the machine. HO 11 still prohibits 
16- and 17-year-olds from being employed in occupations involving the setting 
up, adjusting, repairing, oiling, or cleaning of such pizza-dough rollers. The 
Department has restated this position numerous times in response to written 
requests and has included this position in its Field Operations Handbook since 
at least 1992. The Report recommends that HO 11 be relaxed to allow the 
operation of counter-top models of power-driven bakery machines, comparable to 
those intended for household use. The Report's rationale for this 
recommendation is that available data suggest that there were no fatalities 
involving such counter-top power-driven machines, and nonfatal injuries 
requiring time away from work are of moderate severity (see NIOSH Report, page 
48). Although, as noted, the HO prohibits the use of several different 
power-driven bakery machines, the thrust of the Report's recommendation 
involves food mixers. The Report notes that there were 712 non-fatal injuries 
and illnesses in 1997, with a median of 11 days away from work, associated with 
work with mixers, blenders, and whippers (see NIOSH Report, page 49). The 
Department's enforcement experience includes situations where employers have 
questioned why 16- and 17-year-olds were not permitted to use small mixers to 
process such things as cheese dip and batter for seafood when such machines 
generally appeared to present no risks to such minors. Recently, the Department 
adopted an enforcement policy that it would not assert violations of HO 11 when 
16- and 17-year-olds operate, assist to operate, setup, adjust, repair, oil, or 
clean certain small, lightweight, counter-top mixers. The Department proposed 
to implement the Report's recommendation by creating a new Sec. 570.62(b)(1) 
that would include an [[Page 28437]] exemption allowing the employment of 16- 
and 17-year-olds to operate-- including setting-up, adjusting, repairing, 
oiling, and cleaning-- lightweight, small capacity, portable counter-top 
power-driven food mixers that are, or are comparable to, those models intended 
for household use. The Department, during its meetings held after the release 
of the Report with various stakeholders, including representatives of the 
full-service and quick-service restaurant industries, sought to identify which 
types of mixers could be operated safely in the workplace by 16- and 
17-year-olds. The information provided, which also echoed the Department's 
enforcement experiences, indicated that such factors as bowl capacity, the 
horsepower of the motor, the portability of the machine (light weight and not 
permanently wired or ``hardwired'' into the establishment's electrical power 
source), and similarity to equipment designed exclusively for home use were all 
important criteria. For purposes of this exemption, the Department proposed 
that a lightweight, small capacity mixer is one that is not hardwired into the 
establishment's power source, is equipped with a motor that operates at no more 
than \1/2\ horsepower, and whose bowl capacity does not exceed five quarts. 
Minors 14- and 15-years of age would still be prohibited from operating or 
assisting in the operation of such mixers under the provisions of Reg. 3 (see 
Sec. 570.33(e) (new)). The Department also proposed to incorporate into Sec. 
570.62 its long-standing enforcement position regarding the operation of 
certain pizza-dough rollers by 16- and 17-year-old workers. The Department's 
enforcement experience indicates that when employers properly apply this 
limited enforcement position, 16- and 17-year-olds can safely operate 
pizza-dough rollers. Accordingly, the Department proposed to create a new Sec. 
570.62(b)(2) that will permit such youth to operate--but not set-up, adjust, 
repair, oil, or clean--those power- driven pizza-dough rollers that: (1) Are 
constructed with safeguards contained in the basic design so as to prevent 
fingers, hands, or clothing from being caught in the in-running point of the 
rollers; (2) have gears that are completely enclosed; and (3) have 
microswitches that disengage the machinery if the backs or sides of the rollers 
are removed. The exception in Sec. 570.62(b)(2) would apply only when all the 
safeguards detailed above are present on the machines, are operational, and 
have not been overridden. The Department also proposed to change the word cooky 
in Sec. 570.62(a)(2) to cookie to reflect the more common spelling of that 
word. The Department received five comments regarding this proposal. The FMI, 
Council, AFL-CIO, and YWN all supported adoption of the Department's 
enforcement position allowing 16- and 17-year-olds to operate--including 
setting-up, adjusting, repairing, oiling, and cleaning--lightweight, small 
capacity, portable counter-top power- driven food mixers that are, or are 
comparable to, those models intended for household use. No comments were 
received opposing this proposal. The FMI, Council, and AFL-CIO also supported 
the proposal to adopt the Department's long-standing enforcement position 
permitting 16- and 17-year-olds to operate--but not set-up, adjust, repair, 
oil, or clean--certain power-driven pizza dough rollers. The YWN opposed this 
proposal, stating ``[a]bsent any concrete information on injury data, and on 
the specific size, make, or models under consideration as possible examples, we 
disagree with this proposal at this time.'' The YWN also endorsed the NIOSH 
Report recommendation that more intensive surveillance of pertinent injuries 
and deaths resulting from the operation of power-driven bakery machines be 
conducted should the Department adopt these proposals. The CLC opposed this 
proposal and reiterated its concerns about the Department's use of its 
prosecutorial discretion to establish enforcement positions in the 
administration and enforcement of the child labor provisions of the FLSA. The 
Department carefully considered all the comments and has decided to adopt the 
proposal with one clarifying modification. The Department wishes to make it 
clear that the exemption contained in Sec. 570.62(b)(1) (new) that permits 16- 
and 17-year-olds to operate certain lightweight, small capacity, portable 
counter-top power-driven food mixers would not apply when the equipment is 
adapted--through the use of various attachments--to perform functions other 
than mixing, or to process meat or poultry products because of the prohibitions 
of HO 10 (Occupations in the operation of power-driven meat-processing machines 
and occupations involving slaughtering, meat and poultry packing, processing, 
or rendering) (see Sec. 570.61, old and new). It is important to note that the 
functions of such mixers, as well as how they are addressed by HO 10 and HO 11, 
change when different ``attachments'' are used. For example, a ``mixer'' as 
discussed in Sec. 570.62(b)(1) would become a ``grinder'' prohibited by HO 10 
(see Sec. 570.61(a)(4)) when the grinding attachment is in use. As per the 
provisions of Sec. 570.61(a)(4), it would not matter if products other than 
meat--such as vegetables or cheese--were being processed. The Department is 
including this information in both Sec. 570.62(b)(1) and Sec. 570.61(a)(4)) to 
avoid confusion and facilitate compliance. The Department appreciates the 
concerns of the YWN and CLC regarding the use of certain power-driven pizza 
dough rollers, but again notes that its enforcement experience indicates that 
when employers properly apply all the provisions of the enforcement 
position--which have been included in the proposed limited exemption-- 16- and 
17-year-olds can safely operate such equipment. The Department also notes, as 
it has stated previously in this Final Rule, that its limited and public 
exercise of its prosecutorial discretion is an efficient and permissible tool 
available to the Secretary in the administration of the child labor provisions 
of the FLSA. J. Occupations Involved in the Operation of Paper-Products 
Machines, Scrap Paper Balers, and Paper Box Compactors (Order 12) (29 CFR 
570.63) Hazardous Occupations Order No. 12 generally prohibits minors under 18 
years of age from working in occupations involving the operation of 
paper-products machines. The HO prohibits, with certain exceptions discussed 
below, the loading, operating, and unloading of scrap paper balers, including 
paper box balers and compacting machines, and other power-driven machines used 
in the remanufacture or conversion of paper or pulp into a finished product. 
When HO 12 was promulgated in 1954, the dangers specifically associated with 
the operation of scrap paper balers involved being caught in the plungers 
during the compression process and suffering strains and other injuries while 
moving the compressed bales. The Compactor and Baler Act was enacted on August 
6, 1996 (Pub. L. 104-174). This legislation amended the FLSA by adding 
subsection 13(c)(5), which permits 16- and 17-year-olds to load, but not 
operate or unload, certain scrap paper balers and paper box compactors only 
when certain conditions are met. One such condition is that the equipment must 
meet specific standards issued for balers or for compactors by the American 
National Standard Institute (ANSI). ANSI is a national organization that 
coordinates the development of voluntary, [[Page 28438]] consensus standards in 
a wide range of areas, including product and worker safety. When enacting the 
Compactor and Baler Act, Congress explicitly applied certain industry standards 
for the determination of which balers and/or compactors are safe for minors to 
load: ANSI Standard ANSI Z245.5-1990 for scrap paper balers or Standard ANSI 
Z245.2-1992 for paper box compactors. Congress has used ANSI standards in other 
contexts as expressions of the best available technology in the safety area. 
For example, the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 directed the 
Department of Labor to adopt the then-existing ANSI standards, rather than 
delay any activity until the agency promulgated particular occupational safety 
and health standards (see section 6(a) of the Occupational Safety and Health 
Act, 29 U.S.C. 655(a)). The ANSI standards for scrap paper balers and paper box 
compactors govern the manufacture and modification of the equipment, the 
operation and maintenance of the equipment, and employee training. The 
Compactor and Baler Act also provides that any new standard(s) adopted by ANSI 
would also be sufficient for the safety of the scrap paper balers and paper box 
compactors, if the Secretary of Labor certifies the new standard(s) to be at 
least as protective of the safety of minors as the two standards specified in 
the Act. In the Final Rule issued in 2004, the Department stated that it would 
publish a Notice in the Federal Register when the Secretary made any such 
certifications. Because these ANSI standards are copyright-protected, the 
Department cannot include them in the regulations or reproduce them for 
distribution to the public. Copies of these standards are available for 
purchase from the American National Standards Institute (ANSI), 25 West 43rd 
St., Fourth Floor, New York, NY 10036. The telephone number for ANSI is (212) 
642-4900 and its Web site is located athttp:// www.ansi.org. In addition, these 
standards are available for inspection at the National Archives and Records 
Administration (NARA). For information on the availability of this material at 
NARA, call (202) 741-6030, or go to:
http://www.archives.gov/federal_register/code_ 
of_federal_regulations/ibr_locations.html. These standards are also available 
for inspection at the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's Docket 
Office, Room N-2625, U.S. Department of Labor, 200 Constitution Avenue, NW., 
Washington, DC 20210, or any of its regional offices. The telephone number for 
the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's Docket Office is (202) 
693-2350 and its Web site is located athttp://dockets.osha.gov. The Department 
issued a Final Rule on December 16, 2004 (69 FR 75382), which revised HO 12 to 
incorporate the provisions of the Compactor and Baler Act. The Final Rule 
became effective on February 14, 2005. As supported by the provisions of the 
Compactor and Baler Act, the Final Rule expanded the coverage of HO 12 to 
include those balers and paper box compactors that process other materials in 
addition to paper products. Prohibited machines include those indoor- types of 
power-driven trash compactors equipped with built-in carts that detach from the 
compactor to facilitate disposal of the compacted waste. With this type of 
machine, an attendant wheels the cart to the dumpster, empties the cart into 
the dumpster, and then wheels the cart back to the compactor where it is 
reattached. Also included would be ``public use'' waste receptacles--often 
found at airports and other large complexes--that include compaction equipment 
that allow the public to dispose of refuse and then automatically processed the 
waste at predetermined intervals. The Final Rule also included the Secretary's 
certification, as permitted by the Compactor and Baler Act, that the new 
Standard ANSI Z245.5-1997 is as protective of the safety of minors as Standard 
ANSI- S245.5-1990, and that the new Standard ANSI Z245.2-1997 is as protective 
of the safety of minors as Standard ANSI Z245.2-1992. Accordingly, these newer 
standards were incorporated into HO 12. The Department, when issuing the 2004 
Final Rule, noted that there still remained one class of balers and compactors 
that falls outside of the scope of HO 12--those machines that are designed or 
used exclusively to process materials other than paper. The Report, in 
recognition of this gap in coverage, recommends that HO 12 be revised to 
include such machines because ``balers and compactors used to process other 
scrap materials such as plastic and aluminum cans pose similar risk of injury 
from crushing or amputation'' (see NIOSH Report, page 50). The Report notes 
that baler and compactor related deaths are not limited to those in which paper 
or cardboard is being processed. Many machines are adaptable for the baling and 
compacting of a wide variety of materials, including paper, aluminum cans, 
plastic milk jugs, and general refuse. Other machines are intended specifically 
for processing a single product, such as metals. These specialized metal balers 
and compactors, which process such items as cars, radiators, and siding, may 
share similar designs and operating procedures with those compactors and balers 
that process only paper products or process other materials in addition to 
paper products. However, these specialized metal balers also include large 
industrial machines that feature shear blades that are not normally present on 
lighter-duty type balers. The Report notes that while these large specialized 
balers are generally found in facilities that specialize in processing scrap 
and waste materials, smaller general-purpose portable machines that serve the 
same functions are marketed for use in businesses such as grocery stores, 
hotels, restaurants, and hospitals. These smaller general- purpose machines 
operate in essentially the same manner as the larger machines and present 
similar risks of injury. In addition, the Report recommends that the Department 
continue to emphasize enforcement of portions of the Compactor and Baler Act 
requiring that balers and compactors conform to construction and operations 
standards that greatly reduce exposure to hazardous energy. The Report notes 
that investigations of baler-related incidents show that failure to maintain 
machinery in safe operating condition contributes to fatalities and serious 
injuries and that neither adult supervisors nor young workers may fully 
appreciate the risks posed by uncontrolled hazardous energy. The Report also 
recommends that the Department retain the limited exemption contained in Sec. 
570.63(c)(2) that permits apprentices and student-learners to perform, under 
specific guidelines, tasks that would otherwise be prohibited by HO 12. The 
Department agreed with the NIOSH Report recommendation regarding the scope of 
the HO and proposed to revise HO 12 to prohibit 16- and 17-year-olds from 
operating, loading, and unloading, with limited exceptions, all balers and 
compactors, regardless of the materials being processed. Both NIOSH 
occupational injury data and the Department's enforcement experience reflect 
that injuries occur when youth operate balers and compactors that are designed 
and used to process materials other than paper. For example, the Department 
investigated the employment of a 17-year-old who had both legs amputated in a 
large industrial baler machine at a recycling center. The machine was the only 
baler at the center and, therefore, was used to process a wide variety of 
items. In a different investigation, another 17-year-old lost his right index 
[[Page 28439]] finger while putting recyclables into an industrial waste 
compactor by hand. The limited exemption provided by FLSA section 13(c)(5) and 
contained in Sec. 570.63(c)(1), which allows 16- and 17-year-old workers, under 
specific conditions, to load but not operate or unload certain scrap paper 
balers and paper box compactors, would remain. This exemption, as detailed in 
the Compactor and Baler Act, would apply only to certain scrap paper balers and 
paper box compactors, as currently defined in Sec. 570.63(b). The exemption 
would not apply to balers and compactors that are not designed or used to 
process paper or cardboard as such equipment may not be considered scrap paper 
balers or paper box compactors as required by the Compactor and Baler Act. The 
proposed revision would be accomplished by adding new subsections to Sec. 
570.63 that would prohibit 16- and 17-year-olds from performing the occupations 
of operating or assisting to operate any baler or compactor that is designed or 
used to process materials other than paper. A baler that is designed or used to 
process materials other than paper would be defined in Sec. 570.63(b) to mean a 
powered machine designed or used to compress materials other than paper or 
cardboard boxes, with or without binding, to a density or form that will 
support handling and transportation as a material unit without requiring a 
disposable or reusable container. A compactor that is designed or used to 
process materials other than paper would be defined in Sec. 570.63(b) to mean a 
powered machine that remains stationary during operation, designed or used to 
compact refuse other than paper or cardboard boxes, into a detachable or 
integral container or into a transfer vehicle. The occasional processing of 
paper or a cardboard box by a machine designed to process other materials would 
not bring the loading of such machines within the limited exemption provided by 
section 13(c)(5). The prohibition against such youth setting up, adjusting, 
repairing, oiling, or cleaning any of the machines currently listed in HO 12 
would be extended to include compactors and balers that are designed to process 
materials other than paper. As previously noted, the Compactor and Baler Act 
provides that any new standard(s) adopted by ANSI would also be sufficient for 
the determination of the safety of the scrap paper balers and paper box 
compactors, if the Secretary of Labor certifies the new standard(s) to be at 
least as protective of the safety of minors as the two standards specified in 
the Act. In the 2004 Final Rule, the Secretary certified that Standard ANSI 
Z245.5-1997 is as protective of the safety of minors as Standard 
ANSI-S245.5-1990 and that Standard ANSI Z245.2-1997 is as protective of the 
safety of minors as Standard ANSI Z245.2-1992. Accordingly, the newer standards 
were incorporated into HO 12. In 2004 ANSI adopted Standard ANSI Z245.2-2004 
(Stationary Compactors--Safety Requirements for Installation, Maintenance, and 
Operations) and Standard ANSI Z245.5-2004 (Baling Equipment--Safety 
Requirements for Installation, Maintenance, and Operations). The Department's 
preliminary review of these new Standards, which included input from NIOSH, 
indicated that the Standards are as protective as those cited in the Compactor 
and Baler Act and should be included in HO 12 along with the older Standards. 
The Department appreciates the Report's recommendation to continue emphasizing 
enforcement of portions of the Compactor and Baler Act requiring that balers 
and compactors conform to construction and operations standards that greatly 
reduce exposure to hazardous energy. The Report notes that investigations of 
baler-related incidents show that failure to maintain machinery in safe 
operating condition contributes to fatalities and serious injuries and that 
neither adult supervisors nor young workers may fully appreciate the risks 
posed by uncontrolled hazardous energy (see NIOSH Report, page 50). The 
Department's enforcement experience supports these findings. Most recently, the 
Department investigated the death of a 16-year-old grocery store worker in New 
York who was crushed to death by a baler that had been jerry-rigged to operate 
while the door to the loading chamber was open. This over-riding of an 
important safety device required by each of the ANSI Standards was done to 
speed up the loading process. As discussed previously, in order for an employer 
to avail itself of the limited exemption contained in Sec. 570.63(c)(1) that 
permits 16- and 17-year-olds under certain conditions to load, but not operate 
or unload, certain scrap paper balers and paper box compactors, the employer 
must determine that the equipment meets an appropriate ANSI Standard listed in 
HO 12. The employer must also post a notice on the machine that states, among 
other things, which applicable ANSI Standard the machine meets. The appropriate 
ANSI Standards govern not only the manufacture and modification of the 
equipment, but the operation and maintenance of the equipment, and employee 
training as well. During enforcement actions involving employers who avail 
themselves of the limited exemption contained in Sec. 570.63(c)(1), the 
Department routinely confirms whether the scrap paper baler or paper box 
compactor being loaded by 16- or 17-year-olds meets the requirements of the 
applicable ANSI Standard, as determined and declared by the employer. If the 
equipment does not meet the requirements of an applicable ANSI Standard, or if 
the employer failed to make such a determination, or if any other requirement 
of the limited exemption contained in FLSA section 13(c)(5) was not met, a 
violation of HO 12 has most likely occurred. The Department will carry on these 
efforts and will continue to work with both NIOSH and OSHA to better educate 
employers, employees, and enforcement personnel about the requirements of the 
ANSI Standards. Such efforts impact the safety of all workers, not just those 
under the age of 18. Finally, the Department proposed to take no action 
concerning the NIOSH Report recommendation concerning the apprenticeship and 
student- learner exemption to HO 12 at this time. As previously discussed, the 
Department issued an ANPRM, in conjunction with and on the same day as the 
NPRM, that requested information from the public on this issue. The Department 
received three comments on this proposal. The brief comments of the AFL-CIO 
stated that it ``strongly supports the DOL's proposal to extend prohibitions to 
include operating, loading and unloading balers and compactors designed or used 
to process materials other than paper.'' The YWN was equally brief, stating 
``[t]he Network strongly agrees with this proposed change.'' The CLC 
``welcomed'' the expansion of the prohibitions of HO 12 to include balers and 
compactors designed or used to process materials other than paper. It states 
that the Department did not address the NIOSH Report's third recommendation 
dealing with HO 12 regarding the importance of enforcing the requirements of 
FLSA section 13(c)(5) that balers and compactors being loaded by 16- and 
17-year-olds meet the designated ANSI standards. The CLC also cited additional 
ANSI standards that touch upon equipment used in the waste disposal and 
recycling industries and questioned why these are not incorporated into HO 12. 
The CLC also was concerned that the ANSI standards are copyright- protected and 
that employers must either purchase them from the American National [[Page 
28440]] Standards Institute or visit a designated OSHA office to view them. It 
also expressed concerns that employers may have difficulty interpreting the 
ANSI standards. Finally, the CLC disapproved of the Department's decision to 
not revisit the limited exemption currently contained in HO 12 for 
student-learners and apprentices. No comments were received regarding whether 
Standard ANSI Z245.5- 2004 is as protective of the safety of minors as Standard 
ANSI Z245.5- 1990 and whether Standard ANSI Z245.2-2004 is as protective of the 
safety of minors as Standard ANSI Z245.2-1992. The Department has carefully 
reviewed the comments and has decided to adopt the proposal, but with one 
modification concerning recently issued ANSI Standards and a revision to the 
section heading. The Department disagrees with the CLC's comment that it failed 
to address NIOSH's third recommendation and notes that the recommendation 
clearly reads that the Department should ``continue to emphasize enforcement 
positions of the Compactor and Baler Act requiring balers to conform to 
construction and operational standards that greatly reduce exposure to 
hazardous energy.'' As noted in the NPRM and again in this Final Rule, the 
Department considers this statement to be an endorsement of its administration 
and enforcement of HO 12 and agreed to continue this important activity. The 
Department notes that when the Compactor and Baler Act was enacted, Congress 
took considerable pains to ensure that the legislation contained appropriate 
safeguards that would provide young workers with necessary protections while 
ensuring that the employers of such youth could achieve and maintain 
compliance. During this process, Congress solicited input from the Department, 
NIOSH, employers, employer associations, and employee associations. The result 
was, as discussed earlier, that the Compactor and Baler Act required that 
before 16- and 17-year-olds could load such equipment, the scrap paper baler 
had to meet Standard ANSI Z245.5-1990 and the paper box compactor had to meet 
Standard ANSI Z245.2-1992. Congress could have chosen to include other 
standards--earlier versions of those ANSI standards the CLC now suggests the 
Department should include in HO 12--but it did not. The Department believes 
Congress was aware that such standards are copyright protected and available to 
the public only at a cost or for reviewing at an appropriate library. The 
Department's enforcement experience confirms that employers have many ways of 
ensuring that, should they wish to take advantage of the limited exception 
contained in FLSA section 13(c)(5), their balers and compactors comply with the 
appropriate ANSI standard. Such employers can consult with the manufacturer of 
the equipment, the supplier of the equipment, the owner of the equipment if the 
equipment is leased, industry and/or employer associations, OSHA, and safety 
engineering consultants. No employer or employer association, when commenting 
on the 1999 or the 2007 NPRM, reported that it was difficult or expensive to 
determine that their balers and/or compactors met or failed to meet the 
appropriate ANSI standards. Congress also provided the Secretary of Labor with 
flexibility when administering FLSA section 13(c)(5) by allowing balers and 
compactors to meet any additional standards adopted by ANSI if certified by the 
Secretary to be at least as protective of the safety of minors as the standards 
contained in the Compactor and Baler Act. The Department interprets this 
provision as permitting it to incorporate only more recent versions of Standard 
ANSI Z245.5-1990 and Standard ANSI Z245.2- 1992--the two standards contained in 
the original legislation. The Department followed this interpretation when it 
amended HO 12 and added Standards ANSI Z245.5-1997 and ANSI Z245.2-1997 in 2004 
(see 69 FR 75396) and again when promulgating this Final Rule. The Department's 
review of Standard ANSI Z245.2-2004 has found it to be as protective of the 
safety of minors as Standard ANSI Z245.2- 1992, and the Department's review of 
Standard ANSI Z245.5-2004 has found it be as protective of the safety of minors 
as Standard ANSI Z245.5-1990. The NPRM notified the public that the Department 
intended to update HO 12 to include the 2004 ANSI standards for compactors and 
balers, and no comments were received as to whether the standards identified in 
the NPRM were as protective of minors as the standards listed in the Compactor 
and Baler Act. After the 2007 NPRM was published, ANSI adopted two new 
standards related to balers and compactors: Standard ANSI Z245.2-2008 
(Stationary Compactors--Safety Requirements for Installation, Maintenance, and 
Operations) and Standard ANSI Z245.5- 2008 (Baling Equipment--Safety 
Requirements for Installation, Maintenance, and Operations). The Department's 
review of these new Standards, which included input from NIOSH, concluded that 
the 2008 ANSI Standards are also as protective as those cited in the Compactor 
and Baler Act. Therefore, the Department has decided to also incorporate the 
2008 ANSI standards into this Final Rule. The Secretary, in promulgating this 
Final Rule, hereby certifies that Standard ANSI Z245.2-2004 and Standard ANSI 
Z245.2-2008 are as protective of the safety of minors as Standard ANSI 
Z245.2-1992 and that Standard ANSI Z245.5-2004 and Standard ANSI Z245.5-2008 
are as protective of the safety of minors as Standard ANSI Z245.5-1990. 
Accordingly, these four newer standards are included in the Final Rule. The 
Department has also decided to provide a table listing all the applicable ANSI 
Standards in Sec. 570.63(c)(1)(iv)(A). The Department has decided to revise the 
title of HO 12 to reflect that, under the Final Rule, it will prohibit 
occupations involved in the operation of all balers and compactors, including 
those that do not process any paper products. Accordingly, the title has been 
revised as follows: Occupations involved in the operation of balers, 
compactors, and paper-products machines (Order 12). As noted earlier, FLSA 
section 13(c)(5) and Sec. 570.63(c)(1)(iv) require that before a 16- or 
17-year-old employee may load a baler or compactor subject to HO 12, his or her 
employer must first post a notice on the equipment stating that: (1) The baler 
or compactor meets the named applicable ANSI standard; (2) sixteen- and 
17-year-old employees may only load the baler or compactor; and (3) any 
employee under the age of 18 may not operate or unload the baler or compactor. 
The Department recognizes the importance of these posting requirements in the 
administration of section 13(c)(5) and addressed this issue in detail in the 
preamble to the Final Rule published in the Federal Register on December 16, 
2004 (69 FR 75382). Since publication of the 2007 NPRM, the Department has 
received several inquiries regarding how these posting requirements impact 
employers of youth who do not own or control the baler or compactor that is 
available for use by their employees. In certain situations, such as at 
shopping malls, industrial parks, office buildings, or military bases, multiple 
employers may have access to and use ``community'' balers and compactors that 
the facilities manager or owner has made available to the tenants or 
contractors. In these situations, the Department has determined that it is not 
necessary for every employer (tenant) that wishes to take advantage of the 
loading exemption to post a notice on [[Page 28441]] the communal equipment as 
required by FLSA section 13(c)(5). The facilities manager or owner, or the 
owner of the equipment, may make the necessary postings and satisfy each 
employer's (tenant's) posting obligations under the exemption. But the employer 
(tenant) must exercise due vigilance, for should the notice be inaccurate or 
incomplete--i.e., the baler or compactor fails to meet the appropriate ANSI 
standard, or the notice fails to fully identify the appropriate ANSI 
standard--the burden of compliance remains with the employer (tenant) of any 
youth who loaded the equipment. An incomplete or inaccurate posting by the 
facilities manager or owner will not relieve an employer from being charged 
with a violation of HO 12 or assessed a child labor civil money penalty. 
Employers that avail themselves of the provisions of the loading exemption 
contained in FLSA section 13(c)(5) and rely on the accuracy of notices posted 
by others cannot delegate their compliance obligations imposed by that 
exemption. Finally, the Department notes that the CLC takes exception to the 
Department not taking any action on the NIOSH Report recommendation regarding 
the limited exemption contained in HO 12 for student-learners and apprentices. 
As the Report recommends that the limited exception contained in HO 12 for 
apprentices and student-learners be retained, the Department's decision not to 
address that issue is in full agreement with that recommendation. K. 
Occupations Involved in the Operation of Circular Saws, Band Saws, and 
Guillotine Shears (Order 14) (29 CFR 570.65) HO 14 generally prohibits the 
employment of 16- and 17-year-olds in the occupations of operator or helper on 
power-driven circular saws, band saws, and guillotine shears, except those that 
are properly guarded and equipped with devices for full automatic feeding and 
ejection. The prohibitions of HO 14 are based on the equipment and apply 
regardless of the materials being processed. Section 570.65(b)(4) defines the 
term circular saw to mean a machine equipped with a thin steel disc having a 
continuous series of notches or teeth on the periphery, mounted on shafting, 
and used for sawing materials. The term band saw is defined in Sec. 
570.65(b)(5) to mean a machine equipped with an endless steel band having a 
continuous series of notches or teeth, running over wheels or pulleys, and used 
for sawing materials. Section 570.65(b)(6) defines the term guillotine shear to 
mean a machine equipped with a moveable blade operated vertically and used to 
shear materials. The term does not include other types of shearing machines, 
using a different form of shearing action, such as alligator shears or circular 
shears. HO 14 also prohibits such minors from setting-up, adjusting, repairing, 
oiling, or cleaning circular saws, band saws, and guillotine shears. The 
original report that led to the issuance of HO 14 in 1960 noted that these 
machines had already been found and declared to be particularly hazardous for 
16- and 17-year-old employees when used to process certain materials. Circular 
saws and band saws were already covered under HO 5 when used on wood, HO 10 
when used on meat, and HO 12 when used on paper products. Band saws were also 
covered under HO 11 when used to cut sheet cakes to desired sizes and shapes. 
Guillotine shears are covered under HOs 5, 8, 10 and 12 when used on wood, 
metal, meat, and paper products, respectively. Reports showing that minors were 
being injured when operating these machines on materials not covered by an 
existing HO led the Department to issue the all- encompassing HO 14. The NIOSH 
Report recommends that HO 14 be expanded to cover other machines, such as chain 
saws, that perform cutting and sawing functions through direct contact between 
the cutting surfaces and the materials. The Report also recommends, 
alternatively, that the Department consider developing a new HO that would 
prohibit all sawing machinery that performs cutting and sawing functions 
through direct contact of the cutting surface and the material being processed. 
The Report states: ``Stationary saws and hand-held saws, including chain saws, 
continue to be the source of substantial numbers of fatalities as well as 
nonfatal injuries which may be unusually severe'' (see NIOSH Report, page 56). 
The Report observes that not all machines that perform cutting and sawing 
functions fit into HO 14's definitions of circular saw, band saw, or guillotine 
shears; for example, abrasive cutting disks do not have visible notches or 
teeth, but they perform the same function. The Report notes that available data 
demonstrate that chainsaws specifically contributed to 70 worker deaths between 
1992 and 1997 and over 1,600 lost workday injuries. Some of these fatalities 
involved workers under 18 years of age (see NIOSH Report, page 57). The Report 
also recommends that the Department retain the exemption contained in HO 14 
that permits 16- and 17-year-old apprentices and student learners to perform 
work that would be otherwise prohibited by the HO. The Department has long 
taken the position that HO 4 (Logging occupations and occupations in the 
operation of any sawmill, lath mill, shingle mill, or cooperage stock mill) 
prohibits 16- and 17-year-olds from operating chain saws in logging operations 
because the HO prohibits all work ``in connection with the felling of timber.'' 
Likewise, the Department has consistently taken the position, starting as early 
as 1959, that HO 5 (Occupations involved in the operation of power-driven 
woodworking machines) prohibits these same minors from using chain saws to cut 
wood and wood products, including trees and branches. Over the last ten years, 
the Department has investigated the serious injuries of several youth that 
resulted from the use of chain saws to cut branches and trees, charged 
violations under HO 5, and assessed and collected civil money penalties because 
of those violations. However, as the Report implies, the use of chain saws by 
16- and 17-year-olds would not be prohibited when cutting other materials such 
as metal, concrete, stone, and ice. The Department has also long taken the 
position that HO 5 prohibits the employment of 16- and 17-year-olds to operate 
wood chippers to grind tree limbs, branches, and trunks into chips, mulch, or 
debris. Some questions have recently been raised concerning the appropriateness 
of this position, but the Department has been consistent in its application 
when the equipment is used to process wood and trees. Young workers have been 
killed or seriously injured while operating wood chippers. In 2000, the 
Department investigated the death of a 14-year- old member of a tree-trimming 
crew who was dismembered when he became entangled in branches he was feeding 
into a drum-type wood chipper. In 2001, the Department investigated the serious 
injury of a 17-year-old who suffered a fractured skull when the wood chipper he 
was feeding ``spit out'' a 12-inch long, 4-inch diameter, piece of a tree 
branch. Three titanium plates were permanently implanted into the minor's 
skull. The Department charged the employer of this youth with a violation of HO 
5, and assessed and collected a civil money penalty because of the violation. 
Just like in 1960 when HO 14 was first issued, the Department is receiving 
reports of injuries and deaths, such as the ones described in the preceding 
paragraphs, of youth operating power-driven machines that may be prohibited 
when used to process certain types of materials and not prohibited when 
processing other types of materials. [[Page 28442]] Reciprocating saws 
constitute another example of such a machine. HO 5 prohibits the employment of 
16- and 17-year-olds to operate reciprocating saws that are used or designed 
for cutting wood, but the same piece of equipment is permitted when used or 
designed exclusively to cut materials other than wood, such as metal. The 
Department has learned of occupational injuries to workers operating 
reciprocating saws to cut materials other than wood. The Department is aware of 
the death of an adult plumber in Minnesota in 2002 who was killed when the 
blade of the reciprocating saw he was using to rough-in plumbing entered his 
head near his eye. The U.S. Department of Energy has also reported that in 2002 
an adult worker injured his larynx when the reciprocating saw he was operating 
kicked back and cut him in his lower throat. The American Journal of Forensic 
Medicine and Pathology (Volume 28, No. 4, December 2001) reports on the death 
of a 32-year-old male who lost his balance and fell on the blade of an electric 
reciprocating saw he was using to trim branches. The blade perforated his 
anterior chest wall, right lung, heart, and aorta. The Journal noted that the 
victim had been drinking beer while trimming the branches. Finally, in 2004, 
the Department investigated the death of a 17-year-old worker who was employed 
to operate a reciprocating saw to salvage automobile catalytic converters for 
recycling. While operating the saw, the vehicle upon which he was using the saw 
fell on him and crushed him to death. The Department proposed to revise the 
prohibitions of HO 14 to include chain saws, wood chippers, and reciprocating 
saws. The prohibition would not depend on the material or materials being 
processed and would encompass the occupations of setting-up, adjusting, 
repairing, oiling, or cleaning such machines. This revision would be 
accomplished by revising Sec. 570.65(a)(2) to prohibit the employment of minors 
in the occupations of operator of or helper on power-driven chain saws, wood 
chippers, and reciprocating saws, whether the machines are fixed or portable. 
Unlike the machines currently listed in Sec. 570.65(a)(1), the prohibition 
would not be lifted if the chain saws, wood chippers, or reciprocating saws 
were equipped with full automatic feed and ejection-devices--devices that are 
almost never found on such equipment. The current Sec. 570.65(a)(2) would be 
redesignated as Sec. 570.65(a)(3) and revised to reflect that 16- and 
17-year-olds could not be employed in occupations involving the setting-up, 
adjusting, repairing, oiling, or cleaning of any of the equipment covered by 
the HO. The Department also proposed to revise the title of HO 14 to reflect 
its application to the additional pieces of machinery and to change the word 
operations to operation. Finally, the Department proposed to restructure the 
definitions section contained at Sec. 570.65(b) in an alphabetical sequence to 
comport with guidance provided by the Federal Register and to include 
definitions of the terms chain saw, wood chipper, and reciprocating saw. The 
term chain saw would mean a machine that has teeth linked together to form an 
endless chain used for cutting materials. The term wood chipper would mean a 
machine equipped with a feed mechanism, knives mounted on a rotating chipper 
disc or drum, and a power plant used to reduce to chips or shred such materials 
as tree branches, trunk segments, landscape waste, and other materials. The 
term reciprocating saw would mean a machine equipped with a moving blade that 
alternately changes direction on a linear cutting axis used for sawing 
materials. The Department is evaluating the alternative recommendation made by 
the Report that it consider developing a new HO that combines the sawing 
machinery covered under HO 14 with other specialized machinery that performs 
cutting and sawing functions through direct contact of the cutting surface and 
the material. Similar alternative recommendations were made regarding HO 5 
(Occupations involved in the operation of power-driven woodworking machines) 
and HO 8 (Occupations involved in the operation of power-driven metal forming, 
punching, and shearing machines). The Department will continue to study these 
recommendations. Finally, the Report also recommended that the Department 
retain the limited exemption contained in Sec. 570.65(c) that permits 
apprentices and student-learners to perform, under specific guidelines, tasks 
that would otherwise be prohibited by HO 14. As discussed previously in the 
sections dealing with HOs 10 and 12, the Department proposed to take no action 
concerning the apprenticeship and student-learner exemptions to certain HOs at 
this time. The Department received three comments on this proposal. The YWN 
stated that it ``strongly agrees with this change.'' The AFL-CIO supported the 
proposal and suggested that ``abrasive cutting discs'' be added to the list of 
prohibited equipment. Such discs were mentioned in the NIOSH Report as cutting 
equipment that falls outside the prohibitions of HO 14. The CLC stated that it 
``welcomes'' the proposed inclusion of chain saws, wood chippers, and 
reciprocating saws but also ``sees no reason for DOL's failure to include 
abrasive cutting discs as well.'' The CLC also disagreed with the Department's 
decision not to address the issue of student-learners and apprentices in this 
Final Rule. The Department has carefully reviewed the comments and has decided 
to adopt the proposal with one modification. The Department appreciates the 
comments of the AFL-CIO and the CLC concerning the omission of abrasive cutting 
discs from the list of prohibited equipment contained in HO 14. The Department 
notes that although NIOSH did not include injury data specific to the operation 
of abrasive cutting discs, NIOSH did report that the potential contact with the 
moving disk of an abrasive cutting tool does put operators at risk. The 
Department has decided to add abrasive cutting discs to the list of machines 
prohibited by HO 14 because it would be in keeping with the NIOSH 
recommendation and will provide important protections to working youth. The 
Department has defined abrasive cutting disc to mean a machine equipped with a 
disc embedded with abrasive materials used for cutting materials. The 
Department once again notes that it has requested public comment on the issue 
of exemptions for student-learners and apprentices in the ANPRM that was 
published in conjunction with, and on the same day as, the NPRM. L. Additional 
Recommendations of the Report The NIOSH Report recommends that the Department 
retain, as currently issued, HO 3 (Coal mining occupations), HO 13 (Occupations 
involved in the manufacture of brick, tile, and kindred products), HO 15 
(Occupations involved in wrecking, demolition, and shipbreaking occupations), 
and HO 17 (Occupations in excavation operations). The Department accepted those 
recommendations and proposed no revisions to these HOs. The Report also 
recommends that the Department remove the limited exemption for apprentices and 
student-learners contained in HO 16 (Occupations in roofing operations and on 
or about a roof) and HO 17, and retain the same exemption as it applies to HO 5 
(Occupations involved in the operation of power-driven woodworking machines) 
and HO 8 (Occupations involved in the operation of power- [[Page 28443]] driven 
metal forming, punching, and shearing machines). As discussed previously in the 
sections dealing with HOs 10, 12, and 14 of this preamble, the Department 
proposed to take no action concerning the apprenticeship and student-learner 
exemptions to any of the HOs at this time. The Department believes that before 
any changes to the existing exemptions are made, it is important to first 
consider and develop criteria for determining when apprenticeship and 
student-learners exemptions are appropriate. Accordingly, the Department issued 
an ANPRM, in conjunction with and on the same day as the NPRM, that sought 
information from the public on this and other issues. Only the CLC commented on 
this proposal, expressing its disappointment that the Department has decided 
not to address recommendations regarding the limited exemptions provided for 
student- learner and apprentices at this time. M. Subpart G--General Statements 
of Interpretation of the Child Labor Provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act 
of 1938, as Amended (29 CFR 570.101-570.129) Subpart G discusses the meaning 
and scope of the child labor provisions of the FLSA. The interpretations of the 
Secretary of Labor contained in subpart G indicate the construction of the law 
that guides the Secretary in administrating and enforcing the Act. Since the 
last revision of subpart G in 1971, Congress has passed several amendments to 
the FLSA and the Department has revised other subparts of 29 CFR part 570 that 
are not currently reflected in subpart G. The Department proposed to revise 
subpart G to accommodate not only the statutory and regulatory changes that 
have occurred, but to reflect the proposed revisions to part 570 made by the 
NPRM and discussed earlier in this document. The proposed revisions to subpart 
G were as follows: 1. Section 570.103(c) states that there are only four 
specific child labor exemptions contained in the FLSA, and only one of them, 
concerning the delivery of newspapers to the consumer, applies to the minimum 
wage and overtime requirements of the Act as well. Congress has created four 
additional exemptions to the nonagricultural child labor provisions of the FLSA 
that are not currently reflected in subpart G (the making of wreaths composed 
principally of natural holly, pine, cedar, or other evergreens by homeworkers; 
the loading of certain scrap paper balers and paper box compactors by 16- and 
17-year-olds; the limited driving of certain automobiles and trucks by 
17-year-olds; and the employment of certain youth between the ages of 14 and 18 
years inside and outside of places of business that use power-driven machinery 
to process wood products). The exemption concerning the employment of 
homeworkers who make wreaths, contained in FLSA section 13(d), is an exemption 
from the minimum wage and overtime provisions of the Act as well as its child 
labor provisions. The Department proposed to revise Sec. 570.103(c) to reflect 
that the FLSA now contains eight exemptions from the child labor provisions and 
that two of these exemptions are also exemptions from the Act's minimum wage 
and overtime requirements. This same subsection cites FLSA section 3(d), which 
defines the term employer and then, in footnote 4, discusses that definition. 
FLSA section 3(d) was amended in 1966, and the provisions of that amendment are 
not reflected in subpart G. The Department proposed to revise footnote 4 of 
Sec. 570.101(c) to include the more recent definition of the term employer and 
to correct an erroneous reference to FLSA section 13(d). 2. Section 570.118 
notes that the FLSA sets a minimum age of 16 years for employment in 
manufacturing or mining, but does not take into account the effects of the 2004 
enactment of FLSA section 13(c)(7). Section 13(c)(7) allows the employment of 
certain 14- and 15-year-olds inside and outside of places of business that use 
power-driven machinery to process wood products as discussed above. The 
Department proposed to revise Sec. 570.118 to incorporate the provisions of 
FLSA section 13(c)(7). 3. Section 570.119 discusses those occupations in which 
14- and 15- year-old minors may and may not be employed under Reg. 3. The 
Department proposed to revise this section to incorporate the changes 
necessitated by the adoption of FLSA section 13(c)(7) and to reflect the 
proposed revisions to Sec. Sec. 570.33 and 570.34 as discussed above. For the 
sake of both brevity and clarity, the Department proposed not to repeat in Sec. 
570.119 the lists of all the occupations contained in Sec. Sec. 570.33 and 
570.34, but rather to refer readers to those sections. The proposed revision to 
Sec. 570.119 would contain the general prohibition against the employment of 
minors under 14 years of age under any circumstances that is currently included 
at the end of Sec. 570.119. 4. Section 570.120 describes the authority and 
process by which HOs are adopted, and lists those occupations the Secretary has 
found and declared to be particularly hazardous or detrimental to the health or 
well-being of minors 16 and 17 years of age. Since subpart G was last revised, 
not only have several HOs been amended, but the process for promulgating and 
revising the HOs has also changed. Before 1995, the process for promulgating 
and amending HOs included public hearings and advice from committees composed 
of representatives of employers and employees of the impacted industry and the 
public, in accordance with the procedures established by subpart D of this 
part. The Department issued a Final Rule on April 17, 1995 (60 FR 19336) that 
deleted subpart D and placed the process of promulgating and revising HOs 
solely under the provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U.S.C. 
551 et seq., which governs Departmental rulemaking. The Department proposed to 
revise Sec. 570.120 to reflect the 1995 change in the process for issuing and 
revising HOs. The Department also proposed, for the sake of brevity and 
clarity, not to repeat the list of individual HOs as they are already listed in 
subpart E of 29 CFR part 570. 5. Section 570.122 lists the four exemptions from 
the FLSA child labor provisions that existed when subpart G was last revised. 
As discussed earlier, Congress has added four more exemptions that are not 
included in the current subpart G. The Department proposed to revise Sec. 
570.122 by creating new subsections (e), (f), (g), and (h), which will list the 
exemptions from the child labor provisions contained in FLSA sections 13(d), 
13(c)(5), 13(c)(6), and 13(c)(7), respectively. A more thorough discussion of 
each of these exemptions was proposed to be included in Sec. Sec. 570.127-.130. 
6. The Department proposed to revise Sec. Sec. 570.127, .128, and .129, and 
create a new Sec. 570.130 to present detailed discussions of the exemptions 
from the child labor provisions contained in FLSA sections 13(d), 13(c)(5), 
13(c)(6), and 13(c)(7). These proposed provisions were structured similarly to 
those already contained in subpart G that address the earlier FLSA exemptions 
concerning employment of youth in agriculture (Sec. 570.123), in the delivery 
of newspapers (Sec. 570.124), as actors and performers (Sec. 570.125), and by 
one's parents (Sec. 570.126). The Department also proposed to revise and 
redesignate the sections of subpart G currently dealing with general 
enforcement [[Page 28444]] (Sec. 570.127), good faith defense (Sec. 570.128), 
and the relation of the child labor provisions to other laws (Sec. 570.129). 
These sections would be redesignated as Sec. 570.140, Sec. 570.141, and Sec. 
570.142, respectively. The Department proposed to reserve Sec. Sec. 570.131 
through 570.139 to accommodate any additional statutory amendments to the FLSA 
child labor provisions that may be enacted. 7. Section 570.127 contains a 
general discussion of the enforcement of the FLSA child labor provisions. Since 
that last revision of subpart G, Congress in 1996 amended the FLSA at section 
16(e) so that any person who violates the provisions of section 12 or section 
13(c)(5) relating to child labor, or any regulation issued under section 12 or 
section 13(c)(5), shall be subject to a civil money penalty, currently not to 
exceed $11,000, for each employee who was the subject of such a violation. The 
Department, as discussed above, proposed to redesignate this section as Sec. 
570.140 and to revise it to include the Department's authority to assess civil 
money penalties against persons who violate the child labor provisions of the 
Act. 8. Section 570.128 deals with a provision of FLSA section 12(a) that 
relieves from liability a purchaser who ships or delivers for shipment in 
commerce goods acquired in good faith in reliance on written assurance from the 
producer, manufacturer, or dealer that the goods were produced in compliance 
with section 12 and that were acquired for value without notice of any 
violation. The Department proposed to redesignate this section as Sec. 570.141. 
9. Section 570.129 discusses the relationship of the child labor provisions of 
the FLSA to other laws. The Department proposed to redesignate this section as 
Sec. 570.142. No comments were received on these proposals to amend Subpart G. 
The Department has decided to adopt the above proposals as written, with three 
exceptions. The Department is slightly modifying the proposed revisions to Sec. 
570.122 so as to incorporate guidance provided by the Federal Register. This 
modification does not change the content of the Department's original proposal. 
In addition, the Department will not implement its proposal to reserve Sec. 
Sec. 570.131 through 570.139, again at the direction of the Federal Register. 
Finally, on May 21, 2008, after publication of the NPRM, the Genetic 
Information Nondiscrimination Act of 2008 (GINA), Public Law 110-233, was 
signed into law. This Act, among other things, amends section 16(e) of the Fair 
Labor Standards Act by increasing the maximum permissible civil money penalty 
an employer may be assessed for child labor violations that cause the death or 
serious injury of a young worker. FLSA Section 16(e) now states that any person 
who violates the provisions of FLSA sections 12 or 13(c), relating to child 
labor, or any regulation issued pursuant to such sections, shall be subject to 
a civil penalty not to exceed $11,000 for each employee who was the subject of 
such a violation. This same section also permits the assessment of a penalty 
not to exceed $50,000 with regard to each violation that causes the death or 
serious injury of any employee under 18 years of age. That penalty may be 
doubled up to $100,000 if the violation is determined to be a repeated or 
willful violation. Accordingly, the Department is revising the proposed Sec. 
570.140 (as redesignated as discussed in paragraph 7 above) to incorporate the 
provisions of GINA. The provisions of GINA and the impact they have on this 
rulemaking are more fully discussed later in Section O of this preamble. N. 
Miscellaneous Matters, 29 CFR Part 570 The Department proposed to change the 
name of HO 8 from Occupations involved in the operations of power-driven metal 
forming, punching, and shearing machines (Order 8) to Occupations involved in 
the operation of power-driven metal forming, punching, and shearing machines 
(Order 8). The Department has decided to adopt this proposal as written. Only 
the CLC commented on this proposal, incorrectly referring to it as ``correcting 
a typographical error.'' The word ``operations'' was the word used by the 
Department when HO 8 was first enacted in 1950 and its use was appropriate for 
the time. The Department's replacing of that word with ``operation'' reflects 
the current usage of the word. The Department has made minor, nonsubstantive 
changes to the proposed Sec. 570.119 to better explain the purpose of Sec. 
570.33. In addition, the Department has updated references made in Sec. 570.102 
and in Footnote 21, which is cited in Sec. 570.111. These changes were 
necessitated by the other revisions made in subpart G. Typographical and 
grammatical errors in the proposed regulatory text were also corrected. 
Finally, pursuant to guidance provided by the Federal Register, the Department 
is issuing the proposed Sec. Sec. 570.35a and 570.35b as Sec. Sec. 570.36 and 
570.37 and redesignating existing Sec. Sec. 570.36 and 570.37 as Sec. Sec. 
570.38 and 570.39, respectively. O. Civil Money Penalties; 29 CFR Part 579 
Section 16(e) of the FLSA subjects any person who violates the child labor 
provisions of the Act to civil money penalties. On May 21, 2008, the Genetic 
Information Nondiscrimination Act of 2008 (GINA) (Pub. L. 110-233) was enacted 
into law. GINA, among other things, amended FLSA section 16(e) so that any 
person who violates the provisions of sections 12 or 13(c) of the FLSA, 
relating to child labor, or any regulation issued pursuant to such sections, 
shall be subject to a civil money penalty not to exceed $11,000 for each 
employee who was the subject of such a violation. In addition, GINA also 
permits the assessment of a civil money penalty not to exceed $50,000 with 
regard to each violation that caused the death or serious injury of any 
employee under the age of 18 years. That penalty may be doubled, up to 
$100,000, when such violation is determined by the Department to be a repeated 
or willful violation. These changes in the law became effective May 21, 2008. 
As mentioned above, the NPRM proposed to revise Sec. 570.127 and redesignate it 
as Sec. 570.140. In addition to taking these steps, the Final Rule will 
incorporate the provisions of GINA into (new) Sec. 570.140. The Final Rule will 
also revise those provisions of 29 CFR part 579 relevant to civil monetary 
penalties in order to incorporate the provisions of this recent statutory 
amendment into the regulations. The Department is incorporating the child labor 
civil money penalty provisions of the GINA amendments into this Final Rule 
without prior notice and opportunity for public comment because it has for good 
cause found, pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B), 
that these procedural requirements are unnecessary with respect to these 
particular regulatory changes. The regulatory changes in (new) Sec. 570.140 and 
Part 579 implement the recent legislation that revised the civil monetary 
penalties that may be assessed under section 16(e) of the FLSA. In bringing the 
regulations into conformity with the statutory amendments, the Department is 
not exercising any interpretative authority. Accordingly, the Department is 
incorporating the provisions of the statutory amendments into the Final Rule 
without notice and comment. Specifically, the Department is revising Sec. 
579.1(a) to incorporate the [[Page 28445]] provisions of section 16(e) of the 
FLSA as revised by GINA. The Department is also revising the definitions 
section in Sec. 579.2 to include the terms serious injury, repeated violations, 
and willful violations. GINA amended FLSA section 16(e) to define serious 
injury as (1) permanent loss or substantial impairment of one of the senses 
(sight, hearing, taste, smell, tactile sensation); (2) permanent loss or 
substantial impairment of the function of a bodily member, organ, or mental 
faculty, including the loss of all or part of an arm, leg, foot, hand or other 
body part; or (3) permanent paralysis or substantial impairment that causes 
loss of movement or mobility of an arm, leg, foot, hand or other body part. 
Although GINA does not define the terms repeated violations and willful 
violations, those terms already have been defined by the Wage and Hour Division 
(see 29 CFR 578.3(b) and (c)), and are currently applied, pursuant to section 
16(e) of the Act, in the assessment of civil money penalties for repeated and 
willful violations of sections 6 and 7 of the FLSA. Applying those definitions 
to civil money penalties under 29 CFR part 579, an employer's violation of 
section 12 or section 13(c) of the Act relating to child labor or any 
regulation issued pursuant to such sections shall be deemed to be repeated: (1) 
Where the employer has previously violated section 12 or section 13(c) of the 
Act relating to child labor or any regulation issued pursuant to such sections, 
provided the employer has previously received notice, through a responsible 
official of the Wage and Hour Division or otherwise authoritatively, that the 
employer allegedly was in violation of the provisions of the Act; or (2) where 
a court or other tribunal has made a finding that an employer has previously 
violated section 12 or section 13(c) of the Act relating to child labor or any 
regulation issued pursuant to such sections, unless an appeal therefrom which 
has been timely filed is pending before a court or other tribunal with 
jurisdiction to hear the appeal, or unless the finding has been set aside or 
reversed by such appellate tribunal. For purposes of the assessment of civil 
money penalties under 29 CFR part 579, an employer's violation of section 12 or 
section 13(c) of the Act relating to child labor or any regulation issued 
pursuant to such sections shall be deemed to be willful where the employer knew 
that its conduct was prohibited by the Act or showed reckless disregard for the 
requirements of the Act. All of the facts and circumstances surrounding the 
violation shall be taken into account in determining whether a violation was 
willful. In addition, for purposes of this section, an employer's conduct shall 
be deemed knowing, among other situations, if the employer received advice from 
a responsible official of the Wage and Hour Division to the effect that the 
conduct in question is not lawful. For purposes of this section, an employer's 
conduct shall be deemed to be in reckless disregard of the requirements of the 
Act, among other situations, if the employer should have inquired further into 
whether its conduct was in compliance with the Act, and failed to make adequate 
further inquiry. Finally, the Department is also revising Sec. 579.5, sections 
(a) and (e), to note that FLSA section 16(e) references both sections 12 and 
13(c) when discussing the types of child labor violations that are subject to 
the assessment of civil money penalties. IV. Paperwork Reduction Act In 
accordance with requirements of the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA), 44 U.S.C. 
3501 et seq., and its attendant regulations, 5 CFR part 1320, the Department 
seeks to minimize the paperwork burden for individuals, small businesses, 
educational and nonprofit institutions, Federal contractors, State, local and 
tribal governments, and other persons resulting from the collection of 
information by or for the agency. The PRA typically requires an agency to 
provide notice and seek public comments on any proposed collection of 
information contained in a proposed rule (see 44 U.S.C. 3506(c)(2)(B); 5 CFR 
1320.8). The NPRM published in the Federal Register on April 17, 2007 (72 FR 
19337) invited comments on the information collection burdens imposed by these 
regulations. No comments were received regarding the information paperwork 
burden estimates. An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not 
required to respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a 
currently valid OMB control number (see 5 CFR 1320.6). The Department submitted 
the information collections contained in Sec. 570.37 (previously proposed as 
Sec. 570.35b) of this rule to the OMB for approval, and OMB approved them under 
OMB Control Number 1215-0208. The approval expires on May 31, 2013, unless 
extended by OMB. A copy of the information collection request can be obtained at
http:// www.RegInfo.gov or by contacting the Wage and Hour Division as shown in 
the FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT section of this preamble. Circumstances 
Necessitating Collection: The Department has created a new 29 CFR 570.37 that 
describes the conditions that allow the employment of 14- and 
15-year-olds--pursuant to a school-supervised and school-administered 
Work-Study Program (WSP)--under conditions Reg. 3 otherwise prohibits. The new 
regulation requires the implementation of a new paperwork burden with regard to 
a WSP. FLSA section 3(l) establishes a minimum age of 16 years for most 
nonagricultural employment but allows the employment of 14- and 15- year-olds 
in occupations other than manufacturing and mining, if the Secretary of Labor 
determines such employment is confined to periods that will not interfere with 
the minor's schooling and conditions that will not interfere with the minor's 
health and well-being. FLSA section 11(c) requires all employers covered by the 
FLSA to make, keep, and preserve records of their employees' wages, hours, and 
other conditions and practices of employment. Section 11(c) also authorizes the 
Secretary of Labor to prescribe the recordkeeping and reporting requirements 
for these records. Reg. 3 sets forth the employment standards for 14- and 
15-year-olds. Reporting Requirements: WSP Application: In order to utilize the 
Reg. 3 WSP provisions, Sec. 570.37(b)(2) requires a local public or private 
school system to file with the Administrator of the Wage and Hour Division an 
application for approval of a WSP as one that does not interfere with the 
schooling or health and well-being of the minors involved. Written 
Participation Agreement: The regulations require preparation of a written 
participation agreement for each student participating in a WSP and that the 
teacher-coordinator, employer, and student each sign that agreement (see Sec. 
570.37(b)(3)(iv)). The regulation also requires that the student's parent or 
guardian sign the training agreement, or otherwise give consent to the 
agreement, in order for it to be valid. Recordkeeping Requirements: The 
regulation requires a school system operating a WSP to keep a copy of the 
written participation agreement for each student enrolled in the WSP at the 
student's school. Employers of WSP participants are also required to keep a 
copy of the written participation agreement for each student employed. These 
agreements shall be maintained for 3 years from the date of the student's 
[[Page 28446]] enrollment in the WSP (see Sec. 570.37(b)(4)(ii)). Purpose and 
Use: WSP Application: Under the regulations, a local school system shall file a 
letter of application requesting the Administrator of the Wage and Hour 
Division to approve a WSP that permits the employment of 14- and 15-year-olds 
under conditions that Reg. 3 would otherwise prohibit. The Department will 
evaluate the information to determine if the program meets the requirements 
specified in the regulation, in order to respond to the request. Written 
Participation Agreement: The school system administering the WSP and each 
applicable employer shall separately maintain a copy of the written 
participation agreement for each student. The written agreement shall be signed 
by the teacher-coordinator, the employer, and the student. In addition, the 
student's parent or guardian shall either sign or otherwise provide consent for 
the participation agreement to be valid. The written participation agreement 
shall be structured to ensure that the quality of the student's education, as 
well as his or her safety and well-being, are not compromised. School systems, 
employers, and the Department will use these records to document the validity 
of the WSP and that the 14- and 15-year-old students were employed in 
accordance with the special WSP rules. Information Collection Burdens Total 
Number of Respondents: 1530 (30 school districts and 1500 employers). Total 
Number of Responses: 3030 (30 WSP applications, 1500 school district written 
participation agreements, 1500 employer written participation agreements). 
Total Reporting and Recordkeeping Burden Hours: 1586. Total Dollar Cost Burden: 
$14. The DOL has slightly increased the total burden hour estimate from 1585 
hours to 1586 to align the data with what appears in the General Services 
Administration, Regulatory Information Service Center and the OMB, Office of 
Information and Regulatory Affairs Combined Information System (ROCIS) used to 
track the burdens imposed by Federal government information collections. This 
difference is due to differences in how initial Departmental efforts and ROCIS 
dealt with rounding issues. The Department has also increased the dollar cost 
from $13 to $14 to account for increased postage costs since publication of the 
NPRM. V. Executive Order 12866; Regulatory Flexibility This Final Rule is being 
treated as a ``significant regulatory action'' within the meaning of E.O. 12866 
because of its importance to the public and the Department's priorities. 
Therefore, the Office of Management and Budget has reviewed this rule. However, 
because this rule is not ``economically significant'' as defined in section 
3(f)(1) of E.O. 12866, it does not require a full economic impact analysis 
under section 6(a)(3)(C) of the Order. The new information collection, 
recordkeeping, and reporting requirements subject to the PRA being imposed with 
the enactment of the new work-study program are discussed above. It is well 
established that several characteristics of youth place adolescent workers at 
increased risk of injury and death. Lack of experience in the work place and in 
assessing risks, and developmental factors--physical, cognitive, and 
psychological--all contribute to the higher rates of occupational injuries and 
deaths experienced by young workers. CFOI data reflect that during the period 
of 1994-2004, 15- year-olds experienced an occupational fatality rate of 4.7 
fatalities per 100,000 workers--a rate that was greater than that experienced 
by all workers aged 15 and older. Older working youth share similar risks. The 
NIOSH Report notes that the fatality rate for adolescents aged 16 and 17 was 
5.1 per 100,000 full-time equivalent workers for the 10-year period 1980-89 
[Castillo et al. 1994], while the rate for adults aged 18 and older was 6.1. As 
NIOSH stated, ``[t]his relatively small difference in rates is cause for 
concern because youth under age 18 are employed less frequently in especially 
hazardous jobs.'' NIOSH reports on its Web site (see
http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/youth) that in 2007, an estimated 48,600 
work-related injuries and illnesses among youth 15 to 17 years of age were 
treated in hospital emergency departments. As an estimated one-third of 
work-related injuries are seen in emergency departments, it is likely that 
approximately 146,000 youth sustain work-related injuries and illnesses each 
year. The NIOSH statistics show that, despite the fact that workers aged 15 
through 17 are generally restricted from employment in hazardous occupations 
such as mining, motor-vehicle driving, logging, sawmilling, and construction, 
they have a higher rate of injuries requiring emergency room treatment than any 
other age group except 18- and 19-year-olds (who are not restricted from 
performing such work). The economic and social costs associated with the deaths 
and serious injuries of young workers are substantial. The Department considers 
the issuance of this rule to be an important and necessary step in its ongoing 
review of the criteria for permissible child labor employment, a review which 
strives to balance the potential benefits of transitional, staged employment 
opportunities for youth with the necessary protections for their education, 
health and safety. Because youth often overcome the effects of those 
characteristics that initially place them at increased risk of injury and death 
in the workplace only through the maturation process, it is believed that 
requiring older workers to perform those tasks that present greater risks to 
younger workers actually eliminates injuries and deaths--rather than delaying 
them or transferring them to the older workers. Additionally, this document 
revises the child labor regulations in response to a statutory amendment 
enacted by the Congress that permits certain youth between 14 and 18 years of 
age who are excused from compulsory school attendance beyond the eighth grade 
to be employed under specific conditions inside and outside places of business 
that use machinery to process wood products. Affecting the Reg. 3 occupations 
standards and both HOs 4 and 5, this statutory provision would be available to 
a very small number of minors and therefore is expected to have little or no 
economic impact. The Department believes that only a few minors have obtained 
employment in such occupations since the amendment was enacted and doubts that 
the number will increase. Moreover, the amendment's strong safety-affecting 
requirements that such youth not operate or assist in the operation of 
power-driven woodworking machines, use personal protective equipment to prevent 
exposure to excessive levels of noise and sawdust, and be protected from wood 
particles and other flying debris within the workplace, should significantly 
reduce potential costs resulting from accidents and injuries to minors on the 
job. The implementation of revised subpart G of the child labor regulations, 
General Statements of Interpretation of the Child Labor Provisions of the Fair 
Labor Standards Act of 1938, as Amended, to incorporate all the changes made by 
the agency since this subpart was last revised in 1971, will simply provide 
compliance guidance on the child labor provisions detailed in earlier subparts 
of 570 and therefore imposes no economic costs. [[Page 28447]] The additional 
changes being implemented are also expected to have little or no direct cost 
impact. The changes affecting the types of occupations and industries in which 
14- and 15-year-olds may or may not be employed, as well as the periods and 
conditions of such employment (Reg. 3 occupations and hours standards), are 
largely clarifications of existing provisions or enforcement positions, though 
new occupations involving work of an intellectual or creative nature, 
lifeguarding, and the loading of personal hand tools onto motor vehicles, are 
being added to the list of permitted occupations. The revision of several of 
the nonagricultural HOs--implementing specific recommendations made by NIOSH or 
that arise from the Department's enforcement experience--will, in all but one 
instance involving the use of certain counter-top mixers (HO 11), require 
employers to assign older workers to perform tasks that previously may have 
been performed by 16- and 17-year-olds. Revisions resulting from the NIOSH 
recommendations include the expansion of HO 4 to prohibit the employment of 
minors in forest fire fighting and fire prevention activities and in timber 
tract and forestry service occupations; the revision of HO 7 to prohibit the 
employment of minors in the tending, servicing, and repairing of hoisting 
equipment and the addition of such equipment as cherry pickers, scissor lifts, 
bucket trucks, aerial platforms, and hoists of less than one ton capacity to 
the list of prohibited equipment; and the expansion of HO 10 to prohibit the 
employment of minors in poultry slaughtering and processing occupations. 
Revisions to HO 12 to prohibit the employment of minors in the operation of 
balers and compactors not currently covered by the HO, and the expansion of HO 
14 to add additional power-driven equipment to the list of equipment minors may 
not operate, are also the result of NIOSH Report recommendations. The 
Department's enforcement experience led it to incorporate into the regulations 
certain long-standing enforcement positions involving the definitions of 
remanufacturing departments of sawmills (HO 4), high- lift trucks (HO 7), and 
the cleaning of power-driven meat processing equipment (HO 10). The Department 
is also, based on its enforcement experience, amending HO 11 to incorporate the 
Department's long- standing position permitting 16- and 17-year-olds, under 
certain conditions, to operate certain pizza-dough rollers, and expanding HO 14 
to prohibit the employment of minors to operate wood chippers and reciprocating 
saws. The Department has incorporated certain provisions of the Genetic 
Information Nondiscrimination Act of 2008 (GINA) into 29 CFR parts 570 and 579 
to implement the legislation, which revised the civil monetary penalties that 
may be assessed under section 16(e) of the FLSA. The regulatory changes that 
implement these statutory changes do no more than conform the 
previously-existing regulations to the recent statutory amendments and do not 
impose any economic costs on employers that are required to comply with the 
provisions of sections 12 and 13(c) of the FLSA. GINA, effective May 21, 2008, 
increased the maximum civil money penalty that may be assessed for violations 
that cause the death or serious injury of a minor from $11,000 to $50,000. GINA 
also permits a doubling of the civil money penalty up to $100,000 when such 
violations are determined to be willful or repeated. The Department believes 
that implementation of the Final Rule would not reduce the overall number of 
safe, positive, and legal employment opportunities available to young workers. 
In fact, employment opportunities for 14- and 15-year-olds would increase with 
creation, for example, of a limited exemption for certain work-study programs, 
allowing youth to be employed in work of an intellectual or creative nature, 
and allowing youth to be employed in those permitted occupations listed in Sec. 
570.34(a) to be performed in additional industries, rather than just in retail, 
food service, and gasoline service establishments. Although, as mentioned 
above, some employers would need to replace younger workers with older workers, 
the impact would be minimal as relatively few minors are currently employed to 
perform these occupations. But the Department believes that these changes are 
important as they are essential to fulfilling its charge of keeping working 
youth safe by prohibiting occupations that are particularly hazardous or 
detrimental to their health or well-being. Any costs that might result from 
using older employees to perform the previously permitted tasks would be more 
than offset by reduced health and productivity costs resulting from accidents 
and injuries to minors on the job. Rules that limit permissible job activities 
for working youth to those that are safe do not, by themselves, impose 
significant added costs on employers, in our view. In fact, ensuring that 
permissible job opportunities for working youth are safe, healthy, and not 
detrimental to their education, as required by the statute, produces many 
positive benefits in addition to fewer occupational injuries and deaths, 
including reduced health and productivity costs that employers may otherwise 
incur because of higher accident and injury rates to young and inexperienced 
workers. In any event, the direct, incremental costs that would be imposed by 
this rule are expected to be minimal. Collectively, they would not have an 
annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely affect in a 
material way the economy or its individual sectors, productivity, jobs, the 
environment, public health or safety, or state, local, or tribal governments or 
communities. Therefore, this rule is not ``economically significant'' and no 
regulatory impact analysis has been prepared. The Department has similarly 
concluded for the same reasons noted above that this rule is not a ``major 
rule'' under the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996 (5 
U.S.C. 801 et seq.). It would not likely result in: (1) An annual effect on the 
economy of $100 million or more; (2) a major increase in costs or prices for 
consumers, individual industries, federal, state, or local government agencies, 
or geographic regions; or (3) significant adverse effects on competition, 
employment, investment, productivity, innovation, or on the ability of 
U.S.-based enterprises to compete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic or 
export markets. While the impact that these regulatory changes will have on 
most affected entities has already been discussed, even those entities that are 
most heavily impacted should each spend an average of less than $1500 to comply 
with the new requirements of this rule. Specifically, the Department believes 
school districts sponsoring a WSP will incur the greatest additional costs. An 
analysis of the time it will take to prepare the application and written 
training agreements for a WSP and the associated recordkeeping suggests these 
educational institutions will each spend an average of about 52.5 hours more to 
comply with this Final Rule than might otherwise be spent to establish a 
similar work- study program. The Department associates no additional costs for 
the workplace observation requirement to ensure compliance with the FLSA child 
labor provisions, because such monitoring will normally be conducted when 
school staff visit the workplace to see whether educational objectives are 
being met. Absent any specific data on compensation of the persons who will 
actually perform the work to ensure [[Page 28448]] compliance, the DOL has 
estimated hourly costs this rule will impose on WSP sponsor schools by 
increasing the October 2009 average annual hourly rate for production or 
nonsupervisory workers on educational and health services payrolls of $19.59 by 
40 percent to account for the value of fringe benefits (see The Employment 
Situation: December 2009, DOL, Bureau of Labor Statistics, January 2010, Table 
B-3,http:// www.bls.gov/news.release/archives/empsit_01082010.pdf). The 
Department then multiplied this rate, which includes fringe benefits, by 52.5 
hours. Accordingly, the DOL estimates WSP sponsor school districts will incur 
an average of $1440 (rounded) in additional compliance costs. (52.5 hours x 
$19.59 hourly rate x 1.4 fringe benefits factor.) As previously noted, the 
Department expects 30 school districts will have a WSP. The costs imposed by 
this rule should not be significant for any single entity, and they do not 
affect a substantial number of small entities in a way that would require an 
analysis under the Regulatory Flexibility Act. At the time the NPRM was 
published, the Department certified to this effect to the Chief Counsel for 
Advocacy of the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA). Therefore, no Initial 
Regulatory Flexibility Analysis was required. The Department received no 
comments raising concerns about the initial certification. For the reasons 
discussed in this preamble, the Department has similarly concluded and 
certified to the SBA Office of Advocacy Chief Counsel that this Final Rule is 
not expected to have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of 
small entities in a manner that would require a Final Regulatory Flexibility 
Analysis. VI. Unfunded Mandates Reform Act For purposes of the Unfunded 
Mandates Reform Act of 1995, 2 U.S.C. 1532, this rule does not include any 
federal mandate that may result in excess of $100 million in expenditures by 
state, local and tribal governments in the aggregate or by the private sector. 
VII. Executive Order 13132; Federalism This rule does not have federalism 
implications as outlined in E.O. 13132 regarding federalism. The rule does not 
have substantial direct effects on the states, on the relationship between the 
national government and the states, or on the distribution of power and 
responsibilities among the various levels of government. VIII. Executive Order 
13175, Indian Tribal Governments This rule was reviewed under the terms of E.O. 
13175 and determined not to have ``tribal implications.'' The rule does not 
have ``substantial direct effects on one or more Indian tribes, on the 
relationship between the federal government and Indian tribes, or on the 
distribution of power and responsibilities between the federal government and 
Indian tribes.'' As a result, no tribal summary impact statement has been 
prepared. IX. Effects on Families The undersigned hereby certifies that this 
rule will not adversely affect the well-being of families, as discussed under 
section 654 of the Treasury and General Government Appropriations Act, 1999. X. 
Executive Order 13045, Protection of Children E.O. 13045, dated April 23, 1997 
(62 FR 19885), applies to any rule that (1) is determined to be ``economically 
significant'' as defined in E.O. 12866, and (2) concerns an environmental 
health or safety risk that the promulgating agency has reason to believe may 
have a disproportionate effect on children. This rule is not subject to E.O. 
13045 because it is not economically significant as defined in E.O. 12866. In 
addition, although this rule impacts the child labor provisions of the FLSA and 
the employment of adolescents and young adults, it does not impact the 
environmental health or safety risks of children. XI. Environmental Impact 
Assessment A review of this rule in accordance with the requirements of the 
National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA), 42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.; the 
regulations of the Council on Environmental Quality, 40 CFR 1500 et seq.; and 
the Departmental NEPA procedures, 29 CFR part 11, indicates that the rule will 
not have a significant impact on the quality of the human environment. There 
is, thus, no corresponding environmental assessment or an environmental impact 
statement. XII. Executive Order 13211, Energy Supply This rule is not subject 
to E.O. 13211. It will not have a significant adverse effect on the supply, 
distribution or use of energy. XIII. Executive Order 12630, Constitutionally 
Protected Property Rights This rule is not subject to E.O. 12630, because it 
does not involve implementation of a policy ``that has takings implications'' 
or that could impose limitations on private property use. XIV. Executive Order 
12988, Civil Justice Reform Analysis This rule was drafted and reviewed in 
accordance with E.O. 12988 and will not unduly burden the federal court system. 
The rule was: (1) Reviewed to eliminate drafting errors and ambiguities; (2) 
written to minimize litigation; and (3) written to provide a clear legal 
standard for affected conduct and to promote burden reduction. List of Subjects

Title 29, parts 570 and 579, of the Code of Federal Regulations as follows: 
PART 570--CHILD LABOR REGULATIONS, ORDERS AND STATEMENTS OF INTERPRETATION 0 1. 
The authority citation for part 570 subpart C is revised to read as follows: 
Authority: 29 U.S.C. 203(l), 212, 213(c). 0 2. Sections 570.31 through 570.35 
are revised to read as follows: Subpart C--Employment of Minors Between 14 and 
16 Years of Age (Child Labor Reg. 3) Sec. Sec. 570.31 Secretary's 
determinations concerning the employment of minors 14 and 15 years of age. Sec. 
570.32 Effect of this subpart. Sec. 570.33 Occupations that are prohibited to 
minors 14 and 15 years of age. Sec. 570.34 Occupations that may be performed by 
minors 14 and 15 years of age. [[Page 28449]] Sec. 570.35 Hours of work and 
conditions of employment permitted for minors 14 and 15 years of age. * * * * * 
Sec. 570.31 Secretary's determinations concerning the employment of minors 14 
and 15 years of age. The employment of minors between 14 and 16 years of age in 
the occupations, for the periods, and under the conditions specified in Sec. 
570.34 and Sec. 570.35, does not interfere with their schooling or with their 
health and well-being and shall not be deemed to be oppressive child labor. 
Sec. 570.32 Effect of this subpart. This subpart concerns the employment of 
youth between 14 and 16 years of age in nonagricultural occupations; standards 
for the employment of minors in agricultural occupations are detailed in 
subpart E-1. The employment (including suffering or permitting to work) by an 
employer of minors 14 and 15 years of age in occupations detailed in Sec. 
570.34, for the periods and under the conditions specified in Sec. 570.35, 
shall not be deemed to be oppressive child labor within the meaning of the Fair 
Labor Standards Act of 1938, as amended. Employment that is not specifically 
permitted is prohibited. Sec. 570.33 Occupations that are prohibited to minors 
14 and 15 years of age. The following occupations, which is not an exhaustive 
list, constitute oppressive child labor within the meaning of the Fair Labor 
Standards Act when performed by minors who are 14 and 15 years of age: (a) 
Manufacturing, mining, or processing occupations, including occupations 
requiring the performance of any duties in work rooms or work places where 
goods are manufactured, mined or otherwise processed, except as permitted in 
Sec. 570.34 of this subpart. (b) Occupations that the Secretary of Labor may, 
pursuant to section 3(l) of the Fair Labor Standards Act, find and declare to 
be hazardous for the employment of minors between 16 and 18 years of age or 
detrimental to their health or well-being. (c) Occupations that involve 
operating, tending, setting up, adjusting, cleaning, oiling, or repairing 
hoisting apparatus. (d) Work performed in or about boiler or engine rooms or in 
connection with the maintenance or repair of the establishment, machines, or 
equipment. (e) Occupations that involve operating, tending, setting up, 
adjusting, cleaning, oiling, or repairing any power-driven machinery, including 
but not limited to lawn mowers, golf carts, all-terrain vehicles, trimmers, 
cutters, weed-eaters, edgers, food slicers, food grinders, food choppers, food 
processors, food cutters, and food mixers. Youth 14 and 15 years of age may, 
however, operate office equipment pursuant to Sec. 570.34(a) and vacuum 
cleaners and floor waxers pursuant to Sec. 570.34(h). (f) The operation of 
motor vehicles; the service as helpers on such vehicles except those tasks 
permitted by Sec. 570.34(k); and the riding on a motor vehicle, inside or 
outside of an enclosed passenger compartment, except as permitted by Sec. 
570.34(o). (g) Outside window washing that involves working from window sills, 
and all work requiring the use of ladders, scaffolds, or their substitutes. (h) 
All baking and cooking activities except that cooking which is permitted by 
Sec. 570.34(c). (i) Work in freezers and meat coolers and all work in the 
preparation of meats for sale except as permitted by Sec. 570.34(j). This 
section, however, does not prohibit the employment of 14- and 15- year-olds 
whose duties require them to occasionally enter freezers only momentarily to 
retrieve items as permitted by Sec. 570.34(i). (j) Youth peddling, which 
entails the selling of goods or services to customers at locations other than 
the youth-employer's establishment, such as the customers' residences or places 
of business, or public places such as street corners and public transportation 
stations. Prohibited activities associated with youth peddling not only include 
the attempt to make a sale or the actual consummation of a sale, but also the 
preparatory and concluding tasks normally performed by a youth peddler in 
conjunction with his or her sales such as the loading and unloading of vans or 
other motor vehicles, the stocking and restocking of sales kits and trays, the 
exchanging of cash and checks with the employer, and the transportation of 
minors to and from the various sales areas by the employer. Prohibited youth 
peddling also includes such promotion activities as the holding, wearing, or 
waving of signs, merchandise, costumes, sandwich boards, or placards in order 
to attract potential customers, except when performed inside of, or directly in 
front of, the employer's establishment providing the product, service, or event 
being advertised. This provision does not prohibit a young salesperson from 
conducting sales for his or her employer on property controlled by the employer 
that is out of doors but may properly be considered part of the employer's 
establishment. Youth may conduct sales in such employer exterior facilities, 
whether temporary or permanent, as garden centers, sidewalk sales, and parking 
lot sales, when employed by that establishment. Youth peddling does not include 
the activities of persons who, as volunteers and without compensation, sell 
goods or services on behalf of eleemosynary organizations or public agencies. 
(k) Loading and unloading of goods or property onto or from motor vehicles, 
railroad cars, or conveyors, except the loading and unloading of personal 
non-power-driven hand tools, personal protective equipment, and personal items 
to and from motor vehicles as permitted by Sec. 570.34(k). (l) Catching and 
cooping of poultry in preparation for transport or for market. (m) Public 
messenger service. (n) Occupations in connection with: (1) Transportation of 
persons or property by rail, highway, air, water, pipeline, or other means; (2) 
Warehousing and storage; (3) Communications and public utilities; (4) 
Construction (including demolition and repair); except such office work 
(including ticket office) or sales work in connection with paragraphs (n)(1), 
(2), (3), and (4) of this section, as does not involve the performance of any 
duties on trains, motor vehicles, aircraft, vessels, or other media of 
transportation or at the actual site of construction operations. Sec. 570.34 
Occupations that may be performed by minors 14 and 15 years of age. This 
subpart authorizes only the following occupations in which the employment of 
minors 14 and 15 years of age is permitted when performed for periods and under 
conditions authorized by Sec. 570.35 and not involving occupations prohibited 
by Sec. 570.33 or performed in areas or industries prohibited by Sec. 570.33. 
(a) Office and clerical work, including the operation of office machines. (b) 
Work of an intellectual or artistically creative nature such as, but not 
limited to, computer programming, the writing of software, teaching or 
performing as a tutor, serving as a peer counselor or teacher's assistant, 
singing, the playing of a musical instrument, and drawing, as long as such 
employment complies with all the other provisions contained in Sec. Sec. 
570.33, 570.34, and 570.35. Artistically creative work is limited to work in a 
recognized field of artistic or creative endeavor. (c) Cooking with electric or 
gas grills which does not involve cooking over an [[Page 28450]] open flame 
(Note: This provision does not authorize cooking with equipment such as 
rotisseries, broilers, pressurized equipment including fryolators, and cooking 
devices that operate at extremely high temperatures such as ``Neico 
broilers''). Cooking is also permitted with deep fryers that are equipped with 
and utilize a device which automatically lowers the baskets into the hot oil or 
grease and automatically raises the baskets from the hot oil or grease. (d) 
Cashiering, selling, modeling, art work, work in advertising departments, 
window trimming, and comparative shopping. (e) Price marking and tagging by 
hand or machine, assembling orders, packing, and shelving. (f) Bagging and 
carrying out customers' orders. (g) Errand and delivery work by foot, bicycle, 
and public transportation. (h) Clean up work, including the use of vacuum 
cleaners and floor waxers, and the maintenance of grounds, but not including 
the use of power-driven mowers, cutters, trimmers, edgers, or similar 
equipment. (i) Kitchen work and other work involved in preparing and serving 
food and beverages, including operating machines and devices used in performing 
such work. Examples of permitted machines and devices include, but are not 
limited to, dishwashers, toasters, dumbwaiters, popcorn poppers, milk shake 
blenders, coffee grinders, automatic coffee machines, devices used to maintain 
the temperature of prepared foods (such as warmers, steam tables, and heat 
lamps), and microwave ovens that are used only to warm prepared food and do not 
have the capacity to warm above 140 [deg]F. Minors are permitted to clean 
kitchen equipment (not otherwise prohibited), remove oil or grease filters, 
pour oil or grease through filters, and move receptacles containing hot grease 
or hot oil, but only when the equipment, surfaces, containers and liquids do 
not exceed a temperature of 100 [deg]F. Minors are also permitted to 
occasionally enter freezers momentarily to retrieve items in conjunction with 
restocking or food preparation. (j) Cleaning vegetables and fruits, and the 
wrapping, sealing, labeling, weighing, pricing, and stocking of items, 
including vegetables, fruits, and meats, when performed in areas physically 
separate from a freezer or meat cooler. (k) The loading onto motor vehicles and 
the unloading from motor vehicles of the light, non-power-driven, hand tools 
and personal protective equipment that the minor will use as part of his or her 
employment at the work site; and the loading onto motor vehicles and the 
unloading from motor vehicles of personal items such as a back pack, a lunch 
box, or a coat that the minor is permitted to take to the work site. Such light 
tools would include, but are not limited to, rakes, hand-held clippers, 
shovels, and brooms. Such light tools would not include items like trash, sales 
kits, promotion items or items for sale, lawn mowers, or other power-driven 
lawn maintenance equipment. Such minors would not be permitted to load or 
unload safety equipment such as barriers, cones, or signage. (l)(1) Lifeguard. 
The employment of 15-year-olds (but not 14-year- olds) to perform permitted 
lifeguard duties at traditional swimming pools and water amusement parks 
(including such water park facilities as wave pools, lazy rivers, specialized 
activity areas that may include water falls and sprinkler areas, and baby 
pools; but not including the elevated areas of power-driven water slides) when 
such youth have been trained and certified by the American Red Cross, or a 
similar certifying organization, in aquatics and water safety. (2) Definitions. 
As used in this paragraph (l): Permitted lifeguard duties include the rescuing 
of swimmers in danger of drowning, the monitoring of activities at poolside to 
prevent accidents, the teaching of water safety, and providing assistance to 
patrons. Lifeguards may also help to maintain order and cleanliness in the pool 
and pool areas, give swimming instructions (if, in addition to being certified 
as a lifeguard, the 15-year-old is also properly certified as a swimming 
instructor by the American Red Cross or some other recognized certifying 
organization), conduct or officiate at swimming meets, and administer first 
aid. Additional lifeguard duties may include checking in and out items such as 
towels and personal items such as rings, watches and apparel. Permitted duties 
for 15-year-olds include the use of a ladder to access and descend from the 
lifeguard chair; the use of hand tools to clean the pool and pool area; and the 
testing and recording of water quality for temperature and/or pH levels, using 
all of the tools of the testing process including adding chemicals to the test 
water sample. Fifteen-year-olds employed as lifeguards are, however, prohibited 
from entering or working in any mechanical room or chemical storage areas, 
including any areas where the filtration and chlorinating systems are housed. 
The term permitted lifeguard duties does not include the operation or tending 
of power- driven equipment including power-driven elevated water slides often 
found at water amusement parks and some swimming pools. Minors under 16 years 
of age may not be employed as dispatchers or attendants at the top of elevated 
water slides performing such tasks as maintaining order, directing patrons as 
to when to depart the top of the slide, and ensuring that patrons have begun 
their ``ride'' safely. Properly certified 15-year-old lifeguards may, however, 
be stationed at the ``splashdown pools'' located at the bottom of the elevated 
water slides to perform those permitted duties listed in this subsection. 
Traditional swimming pool means a water tight structure of concrete, masonry, 
or other approved materials located either indoors or outdoors, used for 
bathing or swimming and filled with a filtered and disinfected water supply, 
together with buildings, appurtenances and equipment used in connection 
therewith, excluding elevated ``water slides.'' Not included in the definition 
of a traditional swimming pool would be such natural environment swimming 
facilities as rivers, streams, lakes, ponds, quarries, reservoirs, wharfs, 
piers, canals, or oceanside beaches. Water amusement park means an 
establishment that not only encompasses the features of a traditional swimming 
pool, but may also include such additional attractions as wave pools; lazy 
rivers; specialized activities areas such as baby pools, water falls, and 
sprinklers; and elevated water slides. Not included in the definition of a 
water amusement park would be such natural environment swimming facilities as 
rivers, streams, lakes, reservoirs, wharfs, piers, canals, or oceanside 
beaches. (m)(1) Employment inside and outside of places of business where 
machinery is used to process wood products. The employment of a 14- or 
15-year-old who by statute or judicial order is exempt from compulsory school 
attendance beyond the eighth grade inside or outside places of business where 
machinery is used to process wood products if: (i) The youth is supervised by 
an adult relative of the youth or is supervised by an adult member of the same 
religious sect or division as the youth; (ii) The youth does not operate or 
assist in the operation of power-driven woodworking machines; (iii) The youth 
is protected from wood particles or other flying debris within the workplace by 
a barrier appropriate to the potential hazard of such wood [[Page 28451]] 
particles or flying debris or by maintaining a sufficient distance from 
machinery in operation; and (iv) The youth is required to use, and uses, 
personal protective equipment to prevent exposure to excessive levels of noise 
and saw dust. (2) Compliance. Compliance with the provisions of paragraphs 
(m)(1)(iii) and (m)(1)(iv) of this section will be accomplished when the 
employer is in compliance with the requirements of the applicable governing 
standards issued by the U.S. Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and 
Health Administration (OSHA) or, in those areas where OSHA has authorized the 
state to operate its own Occupational Safety and Health Plan, the applicable 
standards issued by the Office charged with administering the State 
Occupational Safety and Health Plan. The employment of youth under this section 
must comply with the other sections of this subpart, including the hours and 
time of day standards established by Sec. 570.35. (3) Definitions. As used in 
this paragraph (m): Inside or outside places of business shall mean the actual 
physical location of the establishment employing the youth, including the 
buildings and surrounding land necessary to the business operations of that 
establishment. Operate or assist in the operation of power-driven woodworking 
machines shall mean the operating of such machines, including supervising or 
controlling the operation of such machines, feeding material into such 
machines, helping the operator feed material into such machines, unloading 
materials from such machines, and helping the operator unload materials from 
such machines. The term also includes the occupations of setting-up, adjusting, 
repairing, oiling, or cleaning such machines. Places of business where 
machinery is used to process wood products shall mean such permanent workplaces 
as sawmills, lath mills, shingle mills, cooperage stock mills, furniture and 
cabinet making shops, gazebo and shed making shops, toy manufacturing shops, 
and pallet shops. The term shall not include construction sites, portable 
sawmills, areas where logging is being performed, or mining operations. 
Power-driven woodworking machines shall mean all fixed or portable machines or 
tools driven by power and used or designed for cutting, shaping, forming, 
surfacing, nailing, stapling, wire stitching, fastening or otherwise 
assembling, pressing, or printing wood, veneer, trees, logs, or lumber. 
Supervised by an adult relative or is supervised by an adult member of the same 
religious sect or division as the youth has several components. Supervised 
means that the youth's on-the-job activities must be directed, monitored, 
overseen, and controlled by certain named adults. Such supervision must be 
close, direct, constant, and uninterrupted. An adult shall mean an individual 
who is at least eighteen years of age. A relative shall mean the parent (or 
someone standing in the place of a parent), grandparent, sibling, uncle, or 
aunt of the young worker. A member of the same religious sect or division as 
the youth refers to an individual who professes membership in the same 
religious sect or division to which the youth professes membership. (n) Work in 
connection with cars and trucks if confined to the following: dispensing 
gasoline and oil; courtesy service; car cleaning, washing and polishing by 
hand; and other occupations permitted by this section, but not including work 
involving the use of pits, racks, or lifting apparatus, or involving the

Agency. The Administrator shall have discretion to grant requests for special 
variations if the applicant demonstrates that the activity will be performed 
under adequate supervision and training (including safety precautions) and that 
the terms and conditions of the proposed employment will not interfere with the 
health or well-being or schooling of the minor enrolled in an approved program. 
The granting of a special variation is determined on a case-by-case basis. * * 
* * * 0 6. Add a new Sec. 570.37 to read as follows: Sec. 570.37 Work-study 
program. (a) This section varies the provisions contained in Sec. 570.35(a)(1) 
and (a)(5) for the employment of minors 14 and 15 years of age who are enrolled 
in and employed pursuant to a school-supervised and school-administered 
work-study program that meets the requirements of paragraph (b) of this 
section, in the occupations permitted by Sec. 570.34, and for the periods and 
under the conditions specified in paragraph (c) of this section. With these 
safeguards, such employment is found not to interfere with the schooling of the 
minors or with their health and well-being and therefore is not deemed to be 
oppressive child labor. (b)(1) A school-supervised and school-administered 
work-study program shall meet the educational standards established and 
approved by the State Educational Agency in the respective state. (2) The 
superintendent of the public or private school system supervising and 
administering the work-study program shall file with the Administrator of the 
Wage and Hour Division a letter of application for approval of the work-study 
program as one not interfering with schooling or with the health and well-being 
of the minors involved and therefore not constituting oppressive child labor. 
The application shall be filed at least sixty days before the start of the 
school year and must include information concerning the criteria listed in 
paragraph (b)(3) of this section. The Administrator of the Wage and Hour 
Division shall approve the application, or give prompt notice of any denial and 
the reasons therefor. (3) The criteria to be used in consideration of 
applications under this section are the following: (i) Eligibility. Any student 
14 or 15 years of age, enrolled in a college preparatory curriculum, whom 
authoritative personnel from the school attended by the youth identify as being 
able to benefit from the program shall be able to participate. (ii) 
Instructional schedule. Every youth shall receive, every school year he or she 
participates in the work-study program, at least the minimum number of hours of 
classroom instruction, as required by the State Educational Agency responsible 
for establishing such standards, to complete a fully-accredited college 
preparatory curriculum. Such classroom instruction shall include, every year 
the youth participates in the work-study program, training in workplace safety 
and state and federal child labor provisions and rules. (iii) 
Teacher-coordinator. Each school participating in a work- study program shall 
designate a teacher-coordinator under whose supervision the program will 
operate. The teacher-coordinator shall generally supervise and coordinate the 
work and educational aspects of the program and make regularly scheduled visits 
to the workplaces of the participating students to confirm that minors 
participating in the work-study program are employed in compliance with all 
applicable provisions of this part and section 6 of the Fair Labor Standards 
Act. Such confirmation shall be noted in any letters of application filed by 
the superintendent of the public or private school system in accordance with 
paragraph (b)(2) of this section when seeking continuance of its work-study 
program. (iv) Written participation agreement. No student shall participate in 
the work-study program until there has been made a written agreement signed by 
the teacher-coordinator, the employer, and the student. The agreement shall 
also be signed or otherwise consented to by the student's parent or guardian. 
The agreement shall detail the objectives of the work-study program; describe 
the specific job duties to be performed by the participating minor as well as 
the number of hours and times of day that the minor will be employed each week; 
affirm that the participant will receive the minimum number of hours of 
class-room instruction as required by the State Educational Agency for the 
completion of a fully-accredited college preparatory curriculum; and affirm 
that [[Page 28453]] the employment of the minor will be in compliance with the 
child labor provisions of both this part and the laws of the state where the 
work will be performed, and the applicable minimum wage provisions contained in 
section 6 of the FLSA. (v) Other provisions. Any other provisions of the 
program providing safeguards ensuring that the employment permitted under this 
section will not interfere with the schooling of the minors or with their 
health and well-being may also be submitted for use in considering the 
application. (4) Every public or private school district having students in a 
work-study program approved pursuant to these requirements, and every employer 
employing students in a work-study program approved pursuant to these 
requirements, shall comply with the following: (i) Permissible occupations. No 
student shall be assigned to work in any occupation other than one permitted 
under Sec. 570.34. (ii) Records and reports. A copy of the written agreement 
for each student participating in the work-study program shall be kept by both 
the employer and the school supervising and administering the program for a 
period of three years from the date of the student's enrollment in the program. 
Such agreements shall be made available upon request to the representatives of 
the Administrator of the Wage and Hour Division for inspection, transcription, 
and/or photocopying. (c) Employment of minors enrolled in a program approved 
pursuant to the requirements of this section shall be confined to not more than 
18 hours in any one week when school is in session, a portion of which may be 
during school hours, in accordance with the following formula that is based 
upon a continuous four-week cycle. In three of the four weeks, the participant 
is permitted to work during school hours on only one day per week, and for no 
more than for eight hours on that day. During the remaining week of the 
four-week cycle, such minor is permitted to work during school hours on no more 
than two days, and for no more than for eight hours on each of those two days. 
The employment of such minors would still be subject to the time of day and 
number of hours standards contained in Sec. Sec. 570.35(a)(2), (a)(3), (a)(4), 
and (a)(6). To the extent that these provisions are inconsistent with the 
provisions of Sec. 570.35, this section shall be controlling. (d) Programs 
shall be in force and effect for a period to be determined by the Administrator 
of the Wage and Hour Division, but in no case shall be in effect for longer 
than two school years from the date of their approval by the Administrator of 
the Wage and Hour Division. A new application for approval must be filed at the 
end of that period. Failure to meet the requirements of this section may result 
in withdrawal of the approval. (The information collection requirements 
contained in Sec. 570.37 were approved by the OMB under Control No. 1215-0208.)

Statements of Interpretation of the Child Labor Provisions of the Fair Labor 
Standards Act of 1938, as Amended 0 16. The authority citation for subpart G 
continues to read as follows: Authority: 52 Stat. 1060-1069 as amended; 29 
U.S.C. 201-219. 0 17. Section 570.102 is revised to read as follows: Sec. 
570.102. General scope of statutory provisions. The most important of the child 
labor provisions are contained in sections 12(a), 12(c), and 3(l) of the Act. 
Section 12(a) provides that no producer, manufacturer, or dealer shall ship or 
deliver for shipment in interstate or foreign commerce any goods produced in an 
establishment in or about which oppressive child labor was employed within 30 
days before removal of the goods. The full text of this subsection is set forth 
in Sec. 570.104 and its terms are discussed in Sec. Sec. 570.105 to 570.111, 
inclusive. Section 12(c) prohibits any employer from employing oppressive child 
labor in interstate or foreign commerce or in the production of goods for such 
commerce. The text and discussion of this provision appear in Sec. Sec. 570.112 
and 570.113. Section 3(l) of the Act, which defines the term ``oppressive child 
labor,'' is set forth in Sec. 570.117 and its provisions are discussed in Sec. 
Sec. 570.118 to 570.121, inclusive. It will further be noted that the Act 
provides various specific exemptions from the foregoing provisions which are 
set forth and discussed in Sec. Sec. 570.122 to 570.130, inclusive. 0 18. In 
Sec. 570.103, paragraph (c) is revised to read as follows: Sec. 570.103 
Comparison with wage and hour provisions. * * * * * (c) Another distinction is 
that the exemptions provided by the Act from the minimum wage and/or overtime 
provisions are more numerous and differ from the exemptions granted from the 
child labor provisions. There are only eight specific child labor exemptions of 
which only two apply to the minimum wage and overtime pay requirements as well. 
These are the exemptions for employees engaged in the delivery of newspapers to 
the consumer and homeworkers engaged in the making of wreaths composed 
principally of evergreens.\3\ Apart from these two exceptions, none of the 
specific exemptions from the minimum wage and/or overtime pay requirements 
applies to the child labor provisions. However, it should be noted that the 
exclusion of certain employers by section 3(d) \4\ of the Act applies to the 
child labor provisions as well as the wage and hours provisions. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------- \3\ 
Both of these exemptions are contained in section 13(d) of the FLSA. \4\ 
Section 3(d) defines `employer' as including ``any person acting directly or 
indirectly in the interest of an employer in relation to an employee and 
includes a public agency, but does not include any labor organization (other 
than when acting as an employer) or anyone acting in the capacity of officer or 
agent of such labor organization.''

Sec. 570.111 [Amended] 0 19. In Sec. 570.111, footnote 21 is revised to read 
``However, section 12(a) contains a provision relieving innocent purchasers 
from liability thereunder provided certain conditions are met. For a discussion 
of this provision, see Sec. 570.141.'' 0 20. Sections 570.118 through 570.120 
are revised to read as follows: * * * * * Sec. 570.118 Sixteen-year minimum. 
Sec. 570.119 Fourteen-year minimum. Sec. 570.120 Eighteen-year minimum. * * * * 
* Sec. 570.118 Sixteen-year minimum. The Act sets a 16-year-age minimum for 
employment in manufacturing or mining occupations, although under FLSA section 
13(c)(7), certain youth between the ages of 14 and 18 may, under specific 
conditions, be employed inside and outside of places of business that use 
power-driven machinery to process wood products. Furthermore, the 16-year-age 
minimum for employment is applicable to employment in all other occupations 
unless otherwise provided by regulation or order issued by the Secretary. Sec. 
570.119 Fourteen-year minimum. With respect to employment in occupations other 
than manufacturing and mining and in accordance with the provisions of FLSA 
section 13(c)(7), the Secretary is authorized to issue regulations or orders 
lowering the age minimum to 14 years where he or she finds that such employment 
is confined to periods that will not interfere with the minors' schooling and 
to conditions that will not interfere with their health and well-being. 
Pursuant to this authority, the Secretary has detailed in Sec. 570.34 all those 
occupations in which 14- and 15- year-olds may be employed when the work is 
performed outside school hours and is confined to other specified limits. The 
Secretary, in order to provide clarity and assist employers in attaining 
compliance, has listed in Sec. 570.33 certain prohibited occupations that, over 
the years, have been the frequent subject of questions or violations. The list 
of occupations in Sec. 570.33 is not exhaustive. The Secretary has also set 
forth, in Sec. 570.35, additional conditions that limit the periods during 
which 14- and 15-year-olds may be employed. The employment of minors under 14 
years of age is not permissible under any circumstances if the employment is 
covered by the child labor provisions and not specifically exempt. [[Page 
28459]] Sec. 570.120 Eighteen-year minimum. To protect young workers from 
hazardous employment, the FLSA provides for a minimum age of 18 years in 
occupations found and declared by the Secretary to be particularly hazardous or 
detrimental to the health or well-being for minors 16 and 17 years of age. 
Hazardous occupations orders are the means through which occupations are 
declared to be particularly hazardous for minors. Since 1995, the promulgation 
and amendment of the hazardous occupations orders have been effectuated under 
the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U.S.C. 551 et seq. The effect of 
these orders is to raise the minimum age for employment to 18 years in the 
occupations covered. Seventeen orders, published in subpart E of this part, 
have thus far been issued under the FLSA and are now in effect. 0 21. Section 
570.122 is revised to read as follows: Sec. 570.122 General. (a) Specific 
exemptions from the child labor requirements of the Act are provided for: (1) 
Employment of children in agriculture outside of school hours for the school 
district where they live while so employed; (2) Employment of employees engaged 
in the delivery of newspapers to the consumer; (3) Employment of children as 
actors or performers in motion pictures or in theatrical, radio, or television 
productions; (4) Employment by a parent or a person standing in a parent's 
place of his own child or a child in his custody under the age of sixteen years 
in any occupation other than manufacturing, mining, or an occupation found by 
the Secretary to be particularly hazardous for the employment of children 
between the ages of sixteen and eighteen years or detrimental to their health 
or well-being. (5) Employment of homeworkers engaged in the making of evergreen 
wreaths, including the harvesting of the evergreens or other forest products 
used in making such wreaths. (6) Employment of 16- and 17-year-olds to load, 
but not operate or unload, certain scrap paper balers and paper box compactors 
under specified conditions. (7) Employment of 17-year-olds to perform limited 
driving of cars and trucks during daylight hours under specified conditions. 
(8) Employment of youths between the ages of 14 and 18 years who, by statute or 
judicial order, are excused from compulsory school attendance beyond the eighth 
grade, under specified conditions, in places of business that use power-driven 
machinery to process wood products. (b) When interpreting these provisions, the 
Secretary will be guided by the principle that such exemptions should be 
narrowly construed and their application limited to those employees who are 
plainly and unmistakably within their terms. Thus, the fact that a child's 
occupation involves the performance of work which is considered exempt from the 
child labor provisions will not relieve his employer from the requirements of 
section 12(c) or the producer, manufacturer, or dealer from the requirements of 
section 12(a) if, during the course of his employment, the child spends any 
part of his time doing work which is covered but not so exempt. 0 22. The 
undesignated center heading preceding Sec. 570.127 is removed. 0 23. Section 
570.127 is revised to read as follows: Sec. 570.127 Homeworkers engaged in the 
making of evergreen wreaths. FLSA section 13(d) provides an exemption from the 
child labor provisions, as well as the minimum wage and overtime provisions, 
for homeworkers engaged in the making of wreaths composed principally of 
natural holly, pine, cedar, or other evergreens (including the harvesting of 
the evergreens or other forest products used in making such wreaths). Sec. 
570.128 [Redesignated as Sec. 570.141] 0 24. Section 570.128 is redesignated as 
Sec. 570.141 and a new Sec. 570.128 is added to read as follows: Sec. 570.128 
Loading of certain scrap paper balers and paper box compactors. (a) Section 
13(c)(5) of the FLSA provides for an exemption from the child labor provisions 
for the employment of 16- and 17-year-olds to load, but not operate or unload, 
certain power-driven scrap paper balers and paper box compactors under certain 
conditions. The provisions of this exemption, which are contained in HO 12 
(Sec. 570.63) include that the scrap paper baler or compactor meet an 
applicable standard established by the American National Standards Institute 
(ANSI) and identified in the statute, or a more recent ANSI standard that the 
Secretary of Labor has found, incorporated by reference (see Sec. 570.63), and 
declared to be as protective of the safety of young workers as the ANSI 
standard named in the statute. (b) These standards have been incorporated into 
these regulations by reference by the Federal Register as discussed in Sec. 
570.63. In addition, the scrap paper baler or paper box compactor must include 
an on-off switch incorporating a key-lock or other system and the control of 
the system must be maintained in the custody of employees who are at least 18 
years of age. The on-off switch of the scrap paper baler or paper box compactor 
must be maintained in an off position when the machine is not in operation. 
Furthermore, the employer must also post a notice on the scrap paper baler or 
paper box compactor that conveys certain information, including the 
identification of the applicable ANSI standard that the equipment meets, that 
16- and 17-year-old employees may only load the scrap paper baler or paper box 
compactor, and that no employee under the age of 18 may operate or unload the 
scrap paper baler or paper box compactor. Sec. 570.129 [Redesignated as Sec. 
570.142] 0 25. Section 570.129 is redesignated as Sec. 570.142 0 26. A new Sec. 
570.129 is added to read as follows: Sec. 570.129 Limited driving of 
automobiles and trucks by 17-year- olds. Section 13(c)(6) of the FLSA provides 
an exemption for 17-year- olds, but not 16-year-olds, who, as part of their 
employment, perform the occasional and incidental driving of automobiles and 
trucks on public highways under specified conditions. These specific 
conditions, which are contained in HO 2 (Sec. 570.52), include that the 
automobile or truck may not exceed 6,000 pounds gross vehicle weight, the 
driving must be restricted to daylight hours, the vehicle must be equipped with 
a seat belt or similar restraining device for the driver and for any 
passengers, and the employer must instruct the employee that such belts or 
other devices must be used. In addition, the 17-year-old must hold a State 
license valid for the type of driving involved in the job, have successfully 
completed a State-approved driver education course, and have no records of any 
moving violations at the time of his or her hire. The exemption also prohibits 
the minor from performing any driving involving the towing of vehicles; route 
deliveries or route sales; the transportation for hire of property, goods, or 
passengers; urgent, time-sensitive deliveries; or the transporting of more than 
three passengers at any one time. The exemption also places limitations on the 
number of trips the 17-year-old may make each day and restricts the driving 
[[Page 28460]] to a 30-mile radius of the minor's place of employment. 0 27. A 
new Sec. 570.130 is added to read as follows: Sec. 570.130 Employment of 
certain youth inside and outside of places of business that use power-driven 
machinery to process wood products. Section 13(c)(7) of the FLSA provides a 
limited exemption from the child labor provisions for certain youths between 
the ages of 14 and 18 years who, by statute or judicial order, are excused from 
compulsory school attendance beyond the eighth grade, that permits their 
employment inside and outside of places of business that use power- driven 
machinery to process wood products. The provisions of this exemption are 
contained in subpart C of this part (Sec. 570.34(m)) and HO 4 (Sec. 570.54). 
Although the exemption allows certain youths between the ages of 14 and 18 
years to be employed inside and outside of places of business that use 
power-driven machines to process wood products, it does so only if such youths 
do not operate or assist in the operation of power-driven woodworking machines. 
The exemption also requires that the youth be supervised by an adult relative 
or by an adult member of the same religious sect as the youth. The youth must 
also be protected from wood particles or other flying debris within the 
workplace by a barrier appropriate to the potential hazard of such wood 
particles or flying debris or by maintaining a sufficient distance from 
machinery in operation. For the exemption to apply, the youth must also be 
required to use personal protective equipment to prevent exposure to excessive 
levels of noise and sawdust. 0 28. A new center heading and a new Sec. 570.140 
are added to read as follows: Enforcement Sec. 570.140 General. (a) Section 
15(a)(4) of the Act makes any violation of the provisions of sections 12(a) or 
12(c) unlawful. Any such unlawful act or practice may be enjoined by the United 
States District Courts under section 17 upon court action, filed by the 
Secretary pursuant to section 12(b) and, if willful will subject the offender 
to the criminal penalties provided in section 16(a) of the Act. Section 16(a) 
provides that any person who willfully violates any of the provisions of 
section 15 shall upon conviction thereof be subject to a fine of not more than 
$10,000, or to imprisonment for not more than six months, or both. No person 
shall be imprisoned under this subsection except for an offense committed after 
the conviction of such person for a prior offense under this subsection. (b) In 
addition, FLSA section 16(e) states that any person who violates the provisions 
of FLSA sections 12 or 13(c), relating to child labor, or any regulations 
issued under those sections, shall be subject to a civil penalty, not to 
exceed: (1) $11,000, for each employee who was the subject of such a violation; 
or (2) $50,000 with regard to each such violation that causes the death or 
serious injury of any employee under the age of 18 years, which penalty may be 
doubled where the violation is repeated or willful. (c) Part 579 of this 
chapter, Child Labor Violations--Civil Money Penalties, provides for the 
issuance of the notice of civil money penalties for any violation of FLSA 
sections 12 or 13(c) relating to child labor. Part 580 of this chapter, Civil 
Money Penalties-- Procedures for Assessing and Contesting Penalties, describes 
the administrative process for assessment and resolution of the civil money 
penalties. When a civil money penalty is assessed against an employer for a 
child labor violation, the employer has the right, within 15 days after receipt 
of the notice of such penalty, to file an exception to the determination that 
the violation or violations occurred. When such an exception is filed with the 
office making the assessment, the matter is referred to the Chief 
Administrative Law Judge, and a formal hearing is scheduled. At such a hearing, 
the employer or an attorney retained by the employer may present such 
witnesses, introduce such evidence and establish such facts as the employer 
believes will support the exception. The determination of the amount of any 
civil money penalty becomes final if no exception is taken to the 
administrative assessment thereof, or if no exception is filed to the decision 
and order of the administrative law judge. PART 579--CHILD LABOR
