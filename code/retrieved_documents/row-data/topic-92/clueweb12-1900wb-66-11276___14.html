<h2>The &lsquo;Fire&nbsp;Service&rsquo;</h2> March 21, 2012 By Holly Fretwell 
Leave a Comment <br>

<p>The first national forests were set aside more than 100 years ago. Under 
Forest Service management they were intended to provide a continuous flow of 
water and timber for Americans. By the 1980s the agency provided about 25 
percent of US softwood lumber consumption. The timber budget was the largest of 
all agency activities (see chart). Timber harvest on the national forests has 
declined by more than 80 percent since 1985. The current agency mission is 
ecosystem protection but spending has shifted to wildfire management which now 
makes up nearly half of the agency&rsquo;s budget. More than half of that is 
for fire suppression. Nonetheless, wildfire burned nearly 70 million acres over 
the past decade.</p> 
<p>Are Americans getting what they pay for on public lands? Even the General 
Accounting Office&nbsp;[PDF]&nbsp;questions that:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>Historically, the Forest Service has not been able to provide Congress or 
the public with a clear understanding of what the Forest Service&rsquo;s 30,000 
employees accomplish with the approximately $5 billion the agency receives each 
year.</p> </blockquote>

<h2>Who Owns the Truffula&nbsp;Forest?</h2> March 2, 2012 By Holly Fretwell 3 
Comments <br>

<p><em></em></p> 
<p><em>The Lorax</em>, a Dr. Seuss classic, is hitting the big screen this 
weekend. The Lorax is an odd, little character that intrepidly opposes a thneed 
manufacturing plant (whatever that is!) run by the Oncelor.</p> 
<p>Similar to most environmental story plots, this one has a good 
environmentalist, the Lorax, that holds the moral high ground and a bad, 
greedy, profit mongering, capitalist, the Oncelor. In this story the Oncelor 
produces thneeds that appear to be in high demand. During production he clear 
cuts every last Trufulla tree, smogs the air, and clogs the water. As a result 
of the Oncelor&rsquo;s insensitive activities the Brown Bar-ba-loots go hungry 
for there is no more Truffala fruit, the Swomee Swans can no longer croak a 
note, and the gills of the Humming Fish have become gummed. All in the name of 
profit. This, in the end, is also lost because the Oncelor puts himself out of 
business by extricating every last Truffala tree which are a needed input for 
thneed production.</p> 
<p>In his strategy to garner attention for conservation, Dr. Suess misses the 
fundamental motivator: incentives. Industry and profit are not necessarily bad 
and harmful to the environment. Environmental problems are the result of 
conflicting demands on resources. Given well specified rights, negotiation will 
motivate the highest valued resource use. If the Truffala forest was open 
access for anyone to cut, it is possible that the Oncelor and others would race 
to harvest every last tree. Given ownership, however, the Oncelor is more 
likely to invest in future trees to ensure the possibility of future 
production. Weyerhaeuser, for example, is proud to announce that they plant 
millions of trees every year. They do so not to prove their conservation ethic, 
rather as an investment in timber for future production.</p> 
<p>A bit of green PR doesn&rsquo;t hurt, either. The&nbsp;list of movie 
sponsors&nbsp;is a bit surprising, to say the least. As you can imagine, the 
motivator of many of these sponsors is not just good green ethics as much as 
good for the bottom line. And that&rsquo;s OK. If you want to change behavior, 
change the incentives. Profit is a good motivator. If you want to understand 
the fundamentals of environmental problems look at the property rights and 
follow the incentives. Well specified property rights encourage long-term 
stewardship and ensure accountability. That is the moral of my story.</p> 
<p>I have not yet seen &ldquo;The Lorax&rdquo; movie but will think about how 
the storyline may differ given well specified property rights when I do. 
Indeed, the global trend over several decades has been better property rights, 
more&nbsp;economic freedoms, and increased prosperity. I do care about the 
environment, both near and far. And I see things getting better, they really 
are!</p>

<h2>Trade a&nbsp;Tortoise</h2> February 27, 2012 By Laura Huggins Leave a 
Comment <br>

<p>Two years ago in <em>PERC Reports</em> Todd Gartner wrote about his efforts 
at &ldquo;helping the American Forest Foundation develop a market-based habitat 
credit trading system in portions of Georgia and Alabama. The incentive-based 
framework will complement other efforts in the region to keep the eastern 
population of the gopher tortoise off the Endangered Species list.&rdquo;</p> 
<p>Today, Gartner, in collaboration with Josh Donlan and James Mulligan of 
Advanced Conservation Strategies, are ready to launch their first pilot 
transactions.</p> 
<p>Here is how the gopher tortoise candidate conservation marketplace is being 
designed and piloted:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>An interested and eligible private landowner (the &ldquo;seller&rdquo;) 
receives a negotiated payment to conserve, manage, or restore longleaf pine 
forests capable of supporting healthy populations of gopher tortoises on his or 
her property. In so doing, the landowner generates gopher tortoise habitat 
credits.</li> 
<li>The entity paying the landowner (the &ldquo;buyer&rdquo;) receives the 
habitat credits in return. The buyer may use the credits to offset the impact 
on gopher tortoise habitat elsewhere, in order to meet a voluntary net zero 
biodiversity impact commitment.&nbsp; Or, the buyer can save the credits for 
later use to meet offset requirements if the species is listed under the ESA. 
Other buyers may purchase credits simply to spur gopher tortoise conservation.
</li> 
<li>A gopher tortoise habitat credit is the currency that can be bought and 
sold. The number of credits on a parcel of land is determined via a 
science-based and peer-reviewed method to ensure a net conservation benefit for 
the tortoise when used as offsets for future impacts. The credit price includes 
funds to manage and monitor the habitat, along with a negotiated profit margin 
for the seller.</li> 
<li>The USFWS approves the crediting methodology and maintains agreements with 
buyers and sellers. The agency may also provide federal-level assurances to 
both the buyer and seller. This regulatory certainty allows buyers to 
preemptively buy credits that can be used toward offsetting future impacts if 
the species were to be listed.</li> </ul> 
<p>With 87 percent of southern forests in private ownership, protecting 
species like the gopher tortoise requires an innovative&nbsp;approach. The 
gopher tortoise conservation marketplace is testing a new&nbsp;strategy, which 
provides&nbsp;financial incentives to private landowners who manage their 
woodlands for habitat and candidate species.</p>

conservation, such as the approach Gartner began formulating as a

<h2>Should the Forest Service Promote Biomass&nbsp;Heating?</h2> February 9, 
2012 By Guest Contributor <br>

<p><strong>by Steve Bick</strong></p> 
<p>James Kellogg calls on National Forests supply wood to replace fossil fuels 
for thermal energy and boost the use of biomass heating in Western states. In a 
recent article in the Glenwood Springs (CO) Post Independent, Kellog explains 
howNational Forests hold the promise of green energy. We&rsquo;ve seen how 
heating facilities with woody biomass hastaken hold in Vermont and other cold 
locales. Biomass heating could provide markets to facilitate forest fire fuel 
reduction and salvage of beetle-killed wood in Colorado and other western 
states.</p>

<h2>What To Do With That Christmas&nbsp;Tree?</h2> December 27, 2011 By Laura 
Huggins <br>

<p>Once the holidays are over and the glitter and glam is stripped from the 
fir, chances are the Christmas tree ends up in the trash. Perhaps the trees 
could be useful even after they lose their glow. Why not turn them into woody 
biomass for energy? A few companies, suchBiomass One, are doing just that.</p> 
<p>Biomass One, which has been recycling Christmas trees for the past four 
years, estimates it will receive 4,500 trees this year. According to Biomass 
One Vice President Gordon Draper, this amount &ldquo;equals out to 
approximately 56 dry tons of wood biomass, which can provide about an hour and 
a half worth of power to the company&rsquo;s wood-fired cogeneration power 
plant.&rdquo; This is only a tiny amount compared to the 325,000 dry tons of 
wood it grinds up annually to power the plant. And an even smaller amount 
compared to the woody biomass the state of Vermont is using to heat schools and 
other public buildings.</p> 
<p>Burning wood for energy is, of course, an ancient technology, but as Steven 
Bick points out in anew PERC case study, wood can provide an economic and 
environmentally viable solution for high heating costs in many parts of the 
country.</p> 
<p>Bick goes on to explain that beginning in 1985, the state of Vermont 
developed a program using mill waste to power boilers in public schools. At the 
time, most schools in the state were heated with expensive electricity. 
Replacing electric heaters with wood-powered boilers resulted in considerable 
savings in heating costs. Vermont is now home to nearly half of the facilities 
in the United States using woody biomass for heat. Other states are starting to 
replicate Vermont&rsquo;s success and few&nbsp; private companies, including 
Lockheed Martin, are beginning to convert to woody biomass heating.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;Thermal energy from woody biomass is not a panacea to all heating 
needs,&rdquo; writes Bick, &ldquo;but Vermont and other cold locations have 
proven it is a viable and renewable option.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>Christmas Trees: Real or&nbsp;Fake?</h2> December 8, 2011 By Holly Fretwell
<br> 
<p>It is the time of year for the seasonal debate over the family Christmas 
tree: live or artificial? A live tree means removing a tree from the forest, or 
tree plantation, as it may be. A fake tree is usually an import from a foreign 
factory.</p> 
<p>About&nbsp;30 million live Christmas trees&nbsp;are sold in the US every 
year. That is a lot of trees. But do not fear! Our Christmas tree harvesting 
activities result in growing more trees, not less.&nbsp;Two or three seedlings 
are planted&nbsp;for nearly every single Christmas tree cut. Christmas&nbsp;
tree plantations cover 350,000 acres&nbsp;of land in the US and are growing 
about 350 million trees. As long as people continue to demand a fresh tree at 
Christmas, farmers will continue to provide them.</p> 
<p>While it is still popular in some regions, such as here in Montana, to head 
to the local National Forest to cut a tree, the majority of Christmas trees are 
grown on tree farms. Regardless, Forest Service permits to harvest a tree are 
issued to help manage the forest under agency guidelines.</p> 
<p>At seasons end, real&nbsp;trees can be recycled&nbsp;and used for making 
everything from mulch to medicines, or to enhance wildlife habitat and prevent 
erosion. They can be cut into firewood and burned for home heat or as the 
centerpiece for your next weenie roast. They are even used as biomass to create 
energy.</p> 
<p>Alternatively, you can buy a fake tree that is probably made in China. 
Artificial trees are not biodegradable, nor are they a good fuel source.</p> 
<p>If Christmas is your holiday and you desire a tree, buy your Christmas tree 
with pride knowing that by purchasing a tree you are helping to plant several 
more.</p>

<h2>Recycle the Intermountain&nbsp;West</h2> November 5, 2011 By Holly Fretwell
<br> 
<p>Since 1997, more than&nbsp;40 million acres&nbsp;of forests across the West 
have been devastated by pine beetle. The beetle is a natural predator, but 
historic timber management and climatic conditions have given advantage to the 
species in current times. The end result is tinderbox forests across the 
Intermountain region.</p> 
<p>Fire is another natural predator in the forest. The increasing kindling in 
the forest &mdash; such as the bug-killed trees &mdash; together with growing 
development in the wildland-urban interface are a dire mix.</p> 
<p>Recycling&nbsp;dead and dying trees through harvest and re-use is one 
method to reduce the problem. Though the timber value of small-diameter wood is 
low, there are beneficial uses. The wood can be used for firewood, fence posts, 
and poles, even garden mulch, but these are small players. The real potential 
is in biomass but existing uncertainties are making investment tenuous.</p> 
<p>The inability of the Forest Service to provide a continuous supply of 
material is troublesome. It is not a lack of biomass material available on 
National Forest land, nor a question of the benefits from removing the 
material, rather it is the process of contracting for timber removal that is 
costly and time consuming. The Forest Service expenditure on procedure to allow 
timber harvest, even for restoration, is excessive and slow.</p> 
<p>Another barrier to investment in biomass is forthcoming regulation on 
emissions. In spring of last year, the EPA instigated, then suspended, the&nbsp;
tailoring rule. The rule would tax emissions from biomass energy production at 
a rate equal to fossil fuel emissions. The tax would marginalize the 
profitability of biomass production.</p> 
<p>There is a significant difference in the carbon cycle between wood and 
fossil fuel energies. Wood sequesters carbon from the atmosphere in its living, 
tree form, then emits it back into the atmosphere when burned for energy. Put 
simply, it has net zero atmospheric emissions. Fossil fuel moves carbon that is 
held in the earth and releases it into the atmosphere when burned, causing a 
net increase in atmospheric carbon.</p> 
<p>Recycling small diameter forest products is one answer that could help 
reduce the risk, and therefore the costs, of catastrophic wildfire in 
wildland-urban interface, while providing renewable energy. The fight to get 
there, however, is a battle between enviropreneurs, who see good environmental 
results from profitable economic activity, and environmental advocacy groups 
that see profit as evil and exploitive.</p>

<h2>Central Planning and the Wallow&nbsp;Fire</h2> August 19, 2011 By Guest 
Contributor <br>

<p><strong>by Paul Schwennesen</strong></p> 
<p>Prometheus, mankind&rsquo;s great advocate and insubordinate pilferer of 
flame, must be perplexed by the goings-on in fire-riven Arizona. The towering 
columns of smoke have gone, but the forest conflagration has left behind half a 
million charred acres and more than a few smoldering resentments. Primary among 
these resentments is a question over management of public forest resources: who 
should decide how we avoid or at least mitigate such a calamity in the future? 
It is of course ironic; Marx claimed Prometheus as the figurehead of the 
communal mystique, and no asset is more communally owned than America&rsquo;s 
western forests. Not surprisingly, these forests are a prime example of the 
tragic consequences of collective ownership and central management.</p> 
<p>In addition to our famed cactus down south, Arizona harbors around seven 
billion cubic feet of live timber and the world&rsquo;s largest stand of 
ponderosa pine. The Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest lies on 2.63 million 
acres of this stand. Each year, solar energy and carbon are converted into 
nearly twenty-four million cubic feet of timber on national forest land. This 
resource is impressive and aesthetic, drawing sun-scorched tourists by the 
busload.</p> 
<p>It also draws &ldquo;managers&rdquo; by the score. Aldo Leopold embarked on 
his first Forest Service assignment here in 1909, just a few miles from Bear 
Wallow. Ever since, the forest has been managed in the public domain by 
well-educated and better-intentioned technocrats charged with maximizing the 
public good. Under a complicated rubric of &ldquo;multi-use,&rdquo; the Forest 
Service attempts to harvest the sustainable yield of the resource (it is, after 
all, under the Department of Agriculture). Timber, livestock grazing, and 
hunting permits are just a few of the &ldquo;extractive&rdquo; uses they are 
charged with upholding. Habitat protection, endangered species management, and 
increasing recreational demands are a large and growing slice of the resource 
allocation pie.</p> 
<p>The extraordinarily difficult job of balancing these competing demands is 
precisely the sort of thing that bureaucracies are bad at handling. As Malcolm 
Gladwell&nbsp;notes, these kinds of complex problems are not puzzles (which 
more information and better education can help solve), but mysteries (in which 
more information and better education tends to confuse). In the late-1980s, for 
instance, timber harvesting off national forest landcame to a nearly complete 
halt as a result of court injunctions precipitated in the Pacific Northwest. 
Litigation by environmentally conscious lobbying groups, specifically over 
concerns of habitat destruction for endangered species, made large-scale timber 
harvest a thing of the past. Grazing permits likewise encountered a dramatic 
decline for similar reasons. Combined with an aggressive thirty-year campaign 
of actively putting out all fires (is there any more iconic mascot than Smoky 
the Bear?), these actions led predictably to a dramatic increase in 
forest-density and ground cover.</p> 
<p>Forest density and ground cover is called &ldquo;habitat&rdquo; by the 
green contingent, &ldquo;fuel-load&rdquo; by their brown compatriots. And, of 
course, there is an element of truth in each view, often masking personal 
preferences and economic agendas. But the point is this: the kind of see-sawing 
policy shifts which encouraged dramatic, perhaps unsustainable, increases in 
extractive uses in the early 1980s was followed by dramatic, perhaps 
unconscionable, reductions in these uses a decade later. These market-insulated 
policy shifts were not based on good information (which markets are 
extraordinarily good at projecting), but on politics and the relative power of 
lobbying those in control. The short-term increases in forest habitat resulting 
from reduced extraction charged the pan for the tremendous blazes we have 
encountered in the past decade.</p> 
<p>This past May, one of the sun-scorched tourists started a blaze that 
subsequently burned more acreage than any other single event in state history. 
Two and a half billion board feet of timber are estimated to have gone up in a 
whiff of carbon and particulate pollution this summer. Five hundred nineteen 
thousand, three hundred and nineteen acres of prime habitat, prime camping, 
prime hunting, and prime timber disappeared in an ecological blink of an eye. 
Before us lie the smoking remnants of command-and-control planning gone 
predictably awry.</p> 
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; you say, &ldquo;forests burn periodically, it&rsquo;s a 
natural and proper consequence of growth.&rdquo; If only it were that simple. 
Fire is indeed a natural ecological force, particularly in the brittle 
ecosystems of the semi-arid west. But size matters. Half-million acre infernos 
are almost certainly not typical of the &ldquo;natural&rdquo; order of things.

<h2>Forest Service Timber Harvests: Not What They Used To&nbsp;Be</h2> August 
12, 2011 By Holly Fretwell <br>

<p>After more than one thousand miles by jet, 40 minutes by float plane, one 
hour driving, a hike, and a row we arrive to our destination: a 12 x 14 foot 
cabin in remote Alaska on Prince of Wales Island. We had the lake nearly to 
ourselves. A few loons, beautiful cutthroat trout, and some spawning salmon did 
join us. But what is that I hear? A chain saw? The sound gave me pause. It was 
not desired nor expected but understood. I, like all Americans, use a lot of 
wood and paper products.</p> 
<p>I appreciate a good timber harvest for restoration, forest management, and 
wood production. We were on the Tongass National Forest, which is the largest 
national forest in the nation. Over the last several decades timber sales on 
the Tongass have plummeted from over two billion board feet to around 100 
million board feet. I don&rsquo;t know which is better, likely something in 
between. What disturbs me is that the amount&nbsp;cut is determined more by 
politics&nbsp;than sustainable forestry, however you want to define it. (I 
think of sustainable forestry being defined as ensuring a 
continuous&nbsp;timber supply&nbsp;but even if it is wildlife that you want to 
&lsquo;sustain,&rsquo; that is not the goal of current management.)</p> 
<p>The national forests were set aside to provide a continuous supply of 
timber and water for productive use. National Forest timber harvest peaked in 
1987 when harvest provided about 17 percent of U.S. timber production:</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>During the peak of timber harvest for the Forest Service, more than half 
the annual timber growth was harvested and used for timber products, the&nbsp;
mortality rate&nbsp;was about 32 percent. In 2007, only 12 percent of national 
forest growing stock was removed from the forest and mortality increased to 57 
percent.</p> 
<p>More and more national forest timber is left in the forest where insects 
and disease are taking hold. The result is lower valued timber andincreased 
wildfire.</p>

<h2>A Changing Paradigm for National Forest&nbsp;Management</h2> August 5, 2011
 ByHolly Fretwell <br>

<p>The National Forests cover 8 percent of the nation, an area about the size 
of Texas. All public lands make up about one-third of the nation&rsquo;s 
timberland. Timberland is differentiated from forestland by its ability to 
provide commercially valuable timber.</p> 
<p>The last several decades have seen a management paradigm shift on national 
timberlands from commodity production, when they provided nearly 17 percent of 
the nation&rsquo;s timber production, to preservation. Today national forests 
produce less than two percent of U.S. timber production.</p> 
<p>A lot of public forest land is off limits to timber production. More than 
75 million acres are set aside in federal and state wilderness and park areas. 
That does not include other management set asides such as 28 million acres of 
forested roadless area and another 24 million acres that are included in the
Pacific Northwest Forest Plan, most of which is off limits to timber harvest.
</p> 
<p>It is beneficial to realize the alternative uses of the nation&rsquo;s 
public forest lands. It is difficult, however, to know how the different uses 
are valued without a competitive market to signal the price. Are the forests 
more valued for timber or recreation, for example? Are the two mutually 
exclusive? In the end, public lands tend to be managed according to political 
criteria.</p> 
<p>In recent years that has meant less harvest and more timber mortality, 
which, at least in part, has added to the high fire risk that exists in the 
forests. More fires meanmore carbon in the&nbsp;atmosphere. That is an 
unintended consequence of current national forest policy.</p> <em>Originally

<h2>Forests and Wildfires: A Carbon Source or&nbsp;Sink?</h2> July 28, 2011 By 
Holly Fretwell <br>

<p>Forests are a valuable part of the global carbon cycle. They hold the 
largest stock of terrestrial carbon on earth, mostly stored in living trees. 
Forests absorb, or sequester, carbon during photosynthesis. More carbon is 
absorbed in younger trees during faster growth phases. Carbon is emitted in 
decomposition and when wood is burned.</p> 
<p>Net carbon refers to the difference between carbon absorbed and emitted. A 
forest is a source of carbon when emissions exceed sequestration. A forest is a 
carbon sink when absorption is greater than emissions. Net&nbsp;carbon from a 
forest is sensitive&nbsp;to natural conditions, forest disturbance, and forest 
management activities. Wildfire, for example, contributes about&nbsp;5 percent
&nbsp;as much emissions as does the nation&rsquo;s coal production each year.
</p> 
<p>Wildfire can turn a forest that is a carbon sink at one time into a carbon 
source for many years that follow. Because wildfire is a major carbon source, 
reducing wildfire can help to control carbon emissions from the forest.</p> 
<p>There are proposals to remove fuels in the forest to reduce fire severity. 
The&nbsp;80/80&nbsp;rule proposes to decrease woody debris in American forests 
by 40 to 50 percent which, in turn, would allow about 80 percent of the 
existing trees to sustain a fire. This can reduce wildfire carbon emissions by 
as much as&nbsp;50 percent. But that is a lot of wood removal.</p> 
<p>The last several decades have proven difficult for public land managers to 
remove timber. As wildfire and insect infestation become more prevalent, public 
forest management may see political tides begin to revert back toward increased 
timber removal.</p>

<h2>Q&amp;A with PERC Enviropreneur Dave Wager on Tree Ring&nbsp;Pens</h2> 
July 20, 2011 By PERC <br>

<p></p> 
<p>PERC welcomed sixteen conservationists from around the world for its 11th 
annualEnviropreneur Institute, June 26 through July 8, 2011. The program works 
withenvironmental entrepreneurs who seek a better understanding of how business 
and economic principles can be applied to environmental problems. For two 
weeks, participants have the opportunity to interact with leading experts in 
the field of free market environmentalism, including those who have researched 
and applied markets and property rights in their environmental work.</p> 
<p>Dave Wager attended this year&rsquo;s Enviropreneur Institute in Bozeman, 
MT. He is the owner, artisan, and forester forTree Ring Pens, LLC. Prior to 
launching Tree Ring Pens,&nbsp;Dave spent ten years conducting Forest 
Stewardship Council (FSC) endorsed certification assessments on more than 100 
forest management operations covering over 25 million acres of forestland 
across 16 countries.</p> 
<p><strong>Q: What are &ldquo;Tree Ring Pens&rdquo; and where does the wood 
supply come from?</strong></p> 
<p><strong>A</strong>: &nbsp;Tree Ring Pens are fine writing instruments 
crafted from dated tree ring cores. Each pen includes the full chronology 
(first through last annual ring) of a tree&rsquo;s life. Through these annual 
growth rings, each pen shows 100+ years of natural history. As children we 
learned we could figure out how old a tree was by counting its rings. To 
foresters and scientists tree rings serve as an encyclopedia of past forest and 
climate conditions, providing information on tree growth rates, climate 
patterns, &nbsp;forest fire history, &nbsp;and many other ecological topics. 
The Tree Ring Pen was created to share this unique resource through a 
commonly-used object.&nbsp; The wood for Tree Ring Pens comes from forest 
restoration projects in western Montana&mdash;specifically projects that aim to 
restore old growth forests.</p> 
<p><strong>Q: How did you come up with the idea for the Tree Ring Pen and how 
does it relate to forest restoration?</strong></p> 
<p><strong>A:&nbsp; </strong>My idea for the Tree Ring Pen was born more than 
a decade ago while conducting dendrochronology (tree ring) research as part of 
my master&rsquo;s degree. People seemed fascinated by the information and 
history imbedded in tree ring&nbsp;cores, and I had been thinking of ways to 
share tree rings in a wood product. One evening, while working in 
a&nbsp;dendrochronology lab, it dawned on me that tree rings could be displayed 
in a wooden pen. The idea for Tree Ring Pens sat on a back burner until I 
discovered an opportunity to wed it with the need to thin overstocked forests 
in the western U.S. As a result of nearly 100 years of fire suppression, some 
forests, including rare old growth stands, are unnaturally dense, and are more 
susceptible to fires and insect/disease mortality. Without restoration 
treatments, old-growth forests in dry regions of the West are at considerable 
risk. Removing the encroaching conifers through forest thinning is needed to 
restore and help protect remaining old growth forests.</p> 
<p><strong>Q: Does the purchase of a Tree Ring Pen contribute to future forest 
restoration projects?</strong></p> 
<p>Dave Wager in action</p> 
<p><strong>A:&nbsp; </strong>Tree Ring Pens are crafted out of small 
understory trees that are adding unnatural stress to old growth trees. Thinning 
out the small diameter trees improves the resiliency of the old growth stands. 
The aim is to direct Tree Ring Pen restoration efforts at small patches of old 
growth that are being ignored because they lack the economies of 
scale&nbsp;that make restoration thinning economically viable. A significant 
portion of the remnant old growth forests are in remote locations, steep 
terrain, and/or small isolated patches. Remnant old growth stands exist today, 
in part, because they were too inaccessible or too steep to be logged 
economically when widespread logging of old growth forests occurred. 
Ironically, the same cost challenges that explain their existence also serve as 
an impediment to their conservation. By crafting a fine product that displays 
tree ring history, the low value of the small diameter trees can be greatly 
enhanced to provide the necessary economic incentive to accomplish restoration. 
Additionally, Tree Ring Pens LLC is donating 5 percent of the purchase price of 
the sale of each pen to organizations working on forest conservation and 
restoration.[Read more...]</p>
