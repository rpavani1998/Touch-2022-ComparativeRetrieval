<b>C- reactive protein (CRP)</b> <br>
 &quot;C-reactive 
protein: A plasma protein that rises in the blood with the inflammation from 
certain conditions. &quot;C-reactive protein (CRP) is one of the plasma 
proteins known as acute- phase proteins: proteins whose plasma concentrations 
increase (or decrease) by 25% or more during inflammatory disorders. &quot;CRP 
can rise as high as 1000-fold with inflammation. Conditions that commonly lead 
to marked changes in CRP include infection, trauma, surgery, burns, 
inflammatory conditions, and advanced cancer. Moderate changes occur after 
strenuous exercise, heatstroke, and childbirth. Small changes occur after 
psychological stress and in several psychiatric illnesses. ...&quot;<br>

<p> </p> 
<ul> 
<li><b>Introduction</b><br>
 What are SLAPPs? <br>
 &quot;SLAPPs -- Strategic 
Lawsuits Against Public Participation -- are civil complaints or<br>
 
counterclaims (against either an individual or an organization) in which the 
alleged<br>
injury was the result of petitioning or free speech activities 
protected by the First<br>
 Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. SLAPPs are 
often brought by corporations, real<br>
 estate developers, or government 
officials and entities against individuals who oppose<br>
 them on public 
issues. Typically, SLAPPs are based on ordinary civil tort claims such as<br>
 
defamation, conspiracy, and interference with prospective economic advantage.

 &quot;... In 
the case of fragrances and flavours, manufacturers would have the<br>
 
opportunity to make use of the expressions &quot;parfum&quot; (meaning 
fragrance)<br>
 or &quot;aroma&quot; (meaning flavour) to represent these 
groups of ingredients.<br>
<i>This is akin to what we have in the US. 
&quot;Fragrance&quot; or &quot;Flavor&quot; on the label does not begin<br>
 to 
inform the public of the fact that modern fragrances and flavors are 
petrochemically derived.<br>
Also listing adverse health events is not demanded 
as they are for drugs, yet petrochemically<br>
 derived medicines are noted for 
causing the same sort of symptoms as are flavors and fragrances. -- barb</i><br>

 Could it be that cancer is &quot;incurable&quot; because WE 
don't want to give up our reliance upon all<br>
 of our cosmetics and all of 
our other synthetically scented products used for personal care, as<br>
well as 
household and janitorial cleaning and maintenance chores? (This includes 
pesticides,<br>
which in turn includes disinfectants, as they are classified as 
pesticides.) Is cancer incurable<br>
because we don't want to give up our 
&quot;right&quot; to have x-rays every time we turn around?<br>
Despite the 
advertising,x-rays -- mammograms, full-body screenings -- don't prevent <br>
 
or cure cancer . . . in fact, radiation is an acknowledged cause of cancer. 
Despite warnings<br>
 about alcohol and tobacco, we prefer to continue our 
living our life our way. Is cancer truly<br>
 incurable because we are imbued 
with our lifestyle? Do we not see the downside of living through<br>
 
chemistry? I'll guarantee you that many of the harbingers who are living with 
MCS will state<br>
 that the living through chemistry isn't necessarily 
&quot;better.&quot; I think we all should try for<br>
<b>Safer Living Through 
Safer Products, Proved Safer Before Marketing</b>. Perhaps, if we did that, <br>
each of us would start making a difference in our lives and the lives of our 
family. Maybe then<br>
 we'll find that asthma, MCS, . . . cancer is 
PREVENTABLE. Prevent &quot;it&quot; and you don't have<br>
 to worry about 
curing &quot;it&quot;! There are safer, alternative products. Buy and use them.
</i>
<p><i></i> <i>Do I know a little about cancer and its devastating effects? 
Yes, but fortunately, beyond three<br>
false alarms raised, not personally. 
Early on was possible luekemia . . . subsequent blood tests<br>
 proved that a 
dieseas I'd not have to endure at that time (35+ years ago). Then, a false 
reading<br>
 on a PAP test. But instead of going in for surgical procedures, I 
had the PAP repeated. No<br>
 problems. And then, in May 1998, following 11 
months being ostracized to a more toxic office in<br>
my former workplace, I 
was diagnosed with a fast-growing ovarian mass. I didn't rush into<br>
 surgery 
when the CA 125 came back with a very low reading . . . I wanted to see my 60th 
birthday<br>
 with my family all gathered 'round. Besides, in my very being was 
the notion that the surgery<br>
 would have been a success, but a scented 
someone or something would have sent my blood<br>
 pressure soaring, and all 
the drugs would have sent me to the great beyond. As it turns out, I<br>
 
turned to acupuncture. A third sonogram, requested by my acupuncturist the end 
of October 1998<br>
 proved that my ovary was healthy . . . I had a benign 
pedunculated tumor masking as an<br>
 ovarian mass. But, I did live with that 
ovarian mass diagnosis from early May for five and a<br>
 half months . . . and 
I certainly had that feeling of being broadsided by the diagnosis, which really
<br> had confirmed my own suspicions that something was definitely wrong. I 
still live with my<br>
 tumor and use acupuncture and Chinese herbs for pain 
management . . . and with hope, we'll send<br>
 it packing. But cancer has been 
close to me, through my family.</i></p>
<p> <i>My father had his lower jaw removed, along with 2/3 of his tongue, the 
glands in his neck<br>
and his top rib due to cancer at age 60, in 1962. Dad 
smoked. He had been a handsome man. He<br>
 lived with the effects of that 
surger for seven years. He taught himself to speak again and returned<br>
 to 
his practice of chiropractic within a couple of months. Dad died in August 1969 
three weeks<br>
 before his 67th birthday from the effects of a stroke . . . 
also a smoking-related risk.<br>
<br>
 My father-in-law, also a smoker, also 
developed cancer of the jaw -- the side opposite my father's.<br>
 He underwent 
his surgery nearly five years after my father had his. My father-in-law's cancer
<br> spread to his lungs and he died in August 1968, 11 months following 
surgery. If you take time<br>
 zones into consideration, it was to become a 
year to the day before my father died.<br>
<br>
 My mother developed cancer of 
the larynx, coming on with a sudden and then lasting case of<br>
 laryngitis in 
May 1975. In January 1976 she had a biopsy taken, which confirmed her illness. 
She<br>
refused surgery having experienced my father's plight with him. She did 
take cobalt treatments<br>
and continued working until the day after Labor Day, 
1976. She died Sept. 30, three weeks<br>
 before her 63rd birthday.<br>
<br>
 
My mother-in-law never really smoked, although in the early years used to fancy 
herself an<br>
 after dinner smoker. She never inhaled, and blinked at the 
smoke lot -- the effect of her smoking<br>
was not fancy in the least, but it 
may have saved her. She finally gave up that activity upon the<br>
 death of 
her husband. She lived a rather long, relatively healthy life, dying just five 
days before<br>
 her 98th birthday in 1998. She suffered a broken hip in 
October 1998 and, while she survived<br>
 the surgery, she could not win the 
battle against congestive heart failure and pneumonia.<br>
<br>
 My brother had 
basal cell carcinoma that had to be surgically removed from his eye.</i></p>
<p><i> Between my hubby and me, one out of four parents lived a rather long, 
healthy life. That one<br>
 was never a real smoker. Surgery for oral cancers 
are disfiguring, to say the very least.<br>
 Think twice before putting that 
tobacco product in your mouth.<br>

 By Dr. James Coleman &quot;...Many credible studies, including those by the 
National Cancer Institute, have well<br>
 documented that a strong correlation 
exists between an increase in the incidence of<br>
 breast cancers and the use 
of mammograms. Unquestionably, the radiation used in<br>
 mammograms is a known 
human carcinogens. The mainstream medical community<br>
tries to minimize the 
danger of mammograms with the overused trite phrase of &quot;risk vs.<br>
 
benefit.&quot; The plain truth is that the risk is well documented while there 
is absolutely<br>
no medical proof of any benefit. ...&quot;<br>

<p> <i>I have never had a mammogram and began refusing them in my 30s, when

<b>Chapter 1 - Our Conclusion: A Large Share of Breast-Cancers Need

 &quot;We begin this book with our bottom line, because we 
think the advice of Sara Jeannette<br>
 Duncan is good: &quot;If you have 
anything of importance to tell me, please, please<br>
 begin at the end!&quot; 
So here is our conclusion:</p>
<p> &quot;Breast-cancer is a largely preventable disease, and we reach that 
good news because of<br>
 our finding that a large share of recent and current 
breast-cancer in the United<br>
 States is certainly due to past medical 
irradiation of the breasts with x-rays --- at all ages,<br>
 including infancy 
and childhood. Much of today's radiation dosage is preventable,<br>
 without 
any interference with necessary diagnostic radiology, and hence many future<br>

 breast-cancers need not occur. ...&quot;</p>

&quot;WASHINGTON (AP) - Annual mammogram screening for breast cancer among<br>
 
women over 50 does not reduce the rate of death from the disease when<br>
 
compared to women who receive competent physical breast examinations<br>
 
alone, according to a large Canadian study.
<p> The study shows that women who are unable or unwilling to get mammograms

 thorough annual physical breast examinations, said Dr. Cornelia J. Baines of

 &quot;Annually, 
tens of thousands of women are condemned to die of breast cancer 20 years 
prematurely because of poor lifestyle choices. To help reduce the high 
incidence of breast cancer and its recurrence, women are advised to become well 
informed about the potential sources and origins of this disease and its 
epidemiology. It is within a medical certainty that breast cancer is caused by 
ionizing radiation or carcinogenic chemicals or a combination of both. These 
agents cause breast cells to grow out of control resulting in malignant tumors.

Subject: Docket No. 01N-0067 - Against FDA Rule<br>
<br>
 To Whom It May 
Concern:<br>
<br>
 I support Consumers for Dental Choice in wanting mercury 
amalgams classified as<br>
Class III where the manufacturers would be required 
to carry the burden of proving<br>
 safety of their products. <br>
<br>
 I 
further request that the FDA use the most recent and most relevant research 
from peer<br>
 reviewed scientific publications in its decision-making process. 
<br> <br>
 I further request a public hearing and REBUTTAL and REPLY after new 
60-day Comment<br>
 period, and finally, I request a NEW Advisory Panel 
regarding mercury dental fillings.<br>
<br>
 I believe that FDA's existing rule 
would undermine the efforts by states that have<br>
 developed strong laws with 
disclosure language on the risks of mercury fillings.<br>

 &quot;There also are iatrogenic (doctor caused)

Academy of Science published a report 
revealing that for every rad of x-ray exposure,<br>
the risk of breast cancer 
increased by one percent. Nine months later the ACS and NCI<br>
 promoted a 
mammography project in which 300,000 women were enrolled and were<br>
 told 
that the dose of radiation would be perfectly safe, and that the procedure might
<br> pick up breast cancer and save their lives. The minimum dose women 
received in this<br>
 procedure was two rads per mammogram. Some centers 
administered five rads and<br>
 some ten rads. Think of that &atilde; an 
increase in cancer risk of two percent, five percent,<br>
 or ten percent by a 
single test for cancer &atilde; without being informed of the risks! ...&quot;

<br>
 April 5, 1998: 
COMPLETE BOOK now on-line!<br>
 &quot;This book uncovers the major cause of the 
recent breast-cancer incidence<br>
 in the USA. The author shows that past 
exposure to ionizing radiation ---<br>
 primarily medical x-rays --- is 
responsible for about 75 percent of the<br>
 breast-cancer problem in the 
United States.
<p> &quot;The good news: Since the radiation dosage given today by medical <br>
 procedures can be significantly reduced without interfering with a single<br>
 
useful procedure, numerous future cases of breast-cancer can be prevented.<br>

<br> &quot;The author recommends specific actions to start breast-cancer <br>
 
prevention now, not ten years from now.<br>

<li><b>Chapter 1 - Our Conclusion: A Large Share of Breast-Cancers Need Not

 &quot;We begin this book with our bottom line, because we think 
the advice of Sara Jeannette<br>
 Duncan is good: &quot;If you have anything of 
importance to tell me, please, please<br>
 begin at the end!&quot; So here is 
our conclusion:<br>
<br>
 &quot;Breast-cancer is a largely preventable disease, 
and we reach that good news because of<br>
 our finding that a large share of 
recent and current breast-cancer in the United<br>
 States is certainly due to 
past medical irradiation of the breasts with x-rays --- at all ages,<br>
 
including infancy and childhood. Much of today's radiation dosage is 
preventable,<br>
 without any interference with necessary diagnostic radiology, 
and hence many future<br>
 breast-cancers need not occur. ...&quot;<br>

 By Dr. James Coleman;<b><i>Hearts

 &quot;...Many credible studies, including those by the 
National Cancer Institute, have well<br>
 documented that a strong correlation 
exists between an increase in the incidence of<br>
 breast cancers and the use 
of mammograms. Unquestionably, the radiation used in<br>
 mammograms is a known 
human carcinogens. The mainstream medical community<br>
tries to minimize the 
danger of mammograms with the overused trite phrase of &quot;risk vs.<br>
 
benefit.&quot; The plain truth is that the risk is well documented while there 
is absolutely<br>
no medical proof of any benefit. ...&quot;<br>

SUNBATHING HELPS YOU AND EVERYONE</b><br>
 By Dr. Bernarr, D.C. D.D.<br>
 
SUNBATHING DOES NOT CAUSE CANCER OF THE SKIN NOR WRINKLES.<br>
 SUNBATHING 
HELPS HEAL CANCER OF THE SKIN.<br>
 And Dr. Bernarr writes of Dr. Kime:<br>
</p>
<ul> Cancer is helped by sunbathing, writes Dr. Zane R. Kime. Kime writes that 
those who<br>
 get more sunlight have less cancer. Sunbathing heals cancer by 
building up the immune<br>
 system and increasing the oxygen in the tissues. 
Sunlight does not cause skin cancer.<br>
 Healthy people do not get cancer and 
-unhealthy people do get it. Chronic sunburn<br>
 combines with free radicals 
to cause skin cancer. Sunlight may change free radicals,<br>
 dietary fat, 
cholesterol and deranged antioxidants via cooked foods into skin cancer.<br>
 
Under the influence of sunlight, these toxic foods are brought to the skin. 
Cooked foods<br>
 have had their antioxidants, particularly vitamins C and E, 
reduced or deranged by<br>
 cooking. The sources of free radicals are mainly 
dietary fat, especially polyunsaturated<br>
 fats, <b>but also fats and oils 
applied to the skin in suntan lotion and other cosmetics.</b> <br>
 Suppression 
of the 'immune system by drugs may be involved in skin cancer that is<br>
 
stimulated by sunlight. X-rays and chemotherapy cause cancer.</ul>

 &quot;Thursday, March 7, 2002, Letters to 
the Editor,<i>The Washington Post,</i> Page A20<br>
 &quot; In regard to the 
Feb. 22 front-page article about mammograms:<br>
 First, a mammogram does not 
prevent cancer; it can only find an existing cancer.<br>
<br>
 &quot;Second, 
safer methods of diagnosis (without X-rays) are available, including thorough
<br> physical examinations, ultrasound, MRI and thermography. The last takes a 
heat picture<br>
 showing the physiological function breast tissue. 
Thermography is available in France,<br>
 Australia and some centers in the 
United States. Given that every mammogram, indeed<br>
 every X-ray procedure, 
carries an increased risk of causing cancer, development of this<br>
 safe, 
non-radiation technique should be a priority. ...&quot;<br>

<ul> <b>Oxygen Mix Saves Lives</b> <br>
<br>
 Doctors at Toronto General 
Hospital have invented a device that can eliminate<br>
 carbon monoxide (CO) 
from the body three times faster than conventional<br>
 treatment. Conventional 
treatment calls for giving the patient pure oxygen, but<br>
 the Toronto 
researchers found that delivering a mix of oxygen and carbon<br>
 dioxide 
clears CO from the body faster. The new device requires only simple<br>
 
modifications to the regular oxygen masks and tanks already found in<br>
 
ambulances and hospitals.<br>
<br>
 Researcher Joseph Fisher says that CO is 
the leading cause of fatal poisoning in<br>
 the industrialized world. Because 
symptoms of poisoning can swiftly progress<br>
 to coma and even death, it is 
critical to eliminate CO from the exposed patient's<br>
 body as soon as 
possible.

<b>Citizens for A Safe Learning Environment 
(CASLE)</b><br>
 For many years a quick, quiet, and inexpensive solution to 
school flooring needs has<br>
 been to install carpeting. Years later we are 
coming to unexpected realizations. We are<br>
 seeing that the side effects 
from this solution include some significant health<br>
 consequences. Then, for 
that added twist, research has determined that the short term<br>
 cost savings 
are just that - short term.<br>

<li><b><i>Political Perspective on the Use of Pesticides</i></b><br>
 
&quot;Council members, esteemed guests and citizens of Fort Bragg. My name<br>
 
is Marc Lappe'. I direct the not for profit Center for Ethics and Toxics in<br>

 Gualala. I am extremely grateful for this opportunity to talk with you<br>
 
about public and private concerns over the use of pesticides. First, I<br>
 
would like to clear up a misconception some persons have about<br>
 'opposition 
to pesticides.' People like myself who oppose the unbridled<br>
 use of 
chemical controls for pests and unwanted vegetation are sometimes<br>
 thought 
to be espousing a radical, leftist line. In my own case, nothing<br>
 could be 
further from the truth. When it comes to pesticides, I am an<br>
 arch 
conservative. Let me explain.
<p> &quot;As I understand it, a convervative holds the view that personal 
freedom<br>
 is the most important value. This freedom plays out with the right 
for<br>
 self-protection, use of ones own private property, and the right to be 
<br> free of governmental intrusion. These views start from the principle <br>
 
of liberty. The strongest supporter of liberty was the philosopher,<br>
 John 
Stuart Mill. His view was that the greatest liberty is that liberty<br>
 which 
is consistent with liberty for all. The only restriction on liberty<br>
 is 
that its operation not harm others. Mill also argued forcibly against<br>
 
anyone giving up his own freedoms. I believe that the present pattern<br>
 of 
laissez faire pesticide use in our County jeopardizes each of these<br>
 
principles of liberty.</p>
<p> &quot;At first glance, permitting individuals to use whatever pesticides 
they<br>
 want on their own private property would seem to be totally consistent
<br> with the conervative agenda. Use of chemical killers under ones own<br>
 
control is akin to the right to bear arms. But like having a gun, using<br>
 a 
pesticide is a tightly circumscribed &quot;right&quot;. I am free to carry a gun
<br> as long as it is not concealed, it is used in self-defense or form<br>
 
lawful taking of game, and it doesn't harm anyone. The myth is, like<br>
 guns, 
pesticides never killed anyone--only people who use them<br>
 recklessly or 
with disregard of the safety of others. Using<br>
 pesticides--any 
pesticide--is very much akin to carrying a loaded gun.</p>
<p> &quot;There is virtually no one who can use pesticides in the environment 
<br> and respect Mill's definition of liberty. No one can use pesticides on the
<br> scale presently intended by most in the timber industry and secondarily<br>
 by wine grape growers without risk of harm to others. That harm is both<br>
 
direct--to users and unsuspecting persons downstream or downwind of<br>
 
&quot;private land&quot; operations--and indirect, through the contamination of
<br> the environment generally. No one can use a pesticide on a large scale<br>

 and absolutely guarantee that it will not escape their own property.<br>
 
Pesticides do not respect fences or any other artificial boundary.<br>
 
Pesticide drift, percolation into the water supply and build up in<br>
 tissues 
of fish, fowl or wildlife is the rule not the exception.<br>
 Pesticides are 
intended to increase personal liberty by freeing us from<br>
 unwanted 
agricultural pests, fungal blights or structural pests. But if<br>
 that 
freedom is at the risk of compromising the freedom of others, it is<br>
 an 
empty freedom. ...&quot;</p>

<li><b><i>A Toxics Bill of Rights</i></b><br>
 &quot;Preamble:<br>
 All 
persons have a right to an environment which is sufficiently free of<br>
 
controllable contaminants or pollutants to support their health, growth<br>
 
and well-being. Human activities to assure these ends increasingly rely on<br>
 
technical and chemical innovations to enhance the manufacture and<br>
 
production of products and agricultural commodities. While many of<br>
 these 
innovations are deemed necessary for people to achieve comfort,<br>
 enhanced 
productivity or increased goods and products, most carry<br>
 with them high 
costs in terms of secondary toxic effects and resultant<br>
 risks to health. A 
case in point is the mass contamination of aquifers<br>
 and water service 
systems in the United States with chlorinated solvents<br>
 used to assist the 
manufacture of metal and machinery parts in the<br>
 aircraft, industrial, and 
commercial sectors throughout the last century. ...&quot;<br>

sustained<br>
as a result of exposure to chemicals in the environment. The 
Center, in operation<br>
 since 1978, is located off South Carolina Interstate

 square foot Center consists of medical, 
laboratory, and testing facilities. It was<br>
 designed and is run to be as 
safe an environment for our patients as possible &#130; it is a<br>
 strictly 
smoke and scent free facility, utilizing specialized air filtration throughout 
the<br>
 building, water filtration systems, non-toxic cleaning products, and

 &quot;...CRE's mode of operation is to

Although CRE<br>
 participants who contribute to the Center are given an 
opportunity to designate a<br>
 particular issue to be addressed by the Center 
and to review CRE's work product prior<br>
 to its dissemination, they do not 
control either the content or the papers that the<br>
 Center ultimately files

<li><b>CROET research programs </b><br>
 address issues that affect Oregon's 
workforce. Overall, we are examining<br>
 four major themes or questions: What 
are the effects of low-level chemical<br>
 exposures? How can we prevent and 
repair damage to the nervous system?<br>
 How do &quot;nature&quot; (genes) and 
&quot;nurture&quot; (workplace and other environments)<br>
 interact to cause 
disease and injury in the workplace? What is the impact<br>
 of drug use and 
abuse in the workplace?<br>

<li><b>Readers&frac14; Forum - Correspondence with the Chronicle editor</b><br>
 &quot;Think before you spray<br>
 &quot;Our homes and public spaces must 
become fragrance-free. Chemicals are making<br>
many of us sick. I can no 
longer go to church, enjoy a concert or visit the doctor because<br>
 there is 
always someone overscented. But I am not alone. I have CFIDS, fibromyalgia<br>
 
(FM) and multiple chemical sensitivities (MCS) and am a support group leader. 
What<br>
 all MCS patients have in common is the inability to handle 
fragrances. So be<br>
 considerate of others; you may be forcing them into 
isolation.&quot; Delaine<br>

 Try as I might, I can't keep up with the growing information 
available on MCS and<br>
 MCS Chats, etc. That is good news. When I first 
started out, there was very little info<br>
 available. It is also bad news. 
The longer the &quot;experts&quot; have taken the industry's<br>
 line of 
thinking (http://users.lmi.net/~wilworks/books/cmaeibri.htm) to heart, <br>
 
the more millions of people have become ill . . . or prematurely dead. A very 
sad<br>
 commentary. It IS the s, folks. And, it IS indoor air quality that 
really gets us . . .<br>
 and our pets. We all can do something about our 
indoor air ... make smarter, cleaner air,<br>

 &quot;... People can now bury their dead at Forever 
Fernwood in an eco-friendly manner,<br>
using biodegradable materials. They can 
also preserve the burial site in perpetuity by<br>
 purchasing a conservation 
easement planted with a tree, native grass or wildflowers. Of<br>
 course, the 
old cemetery is still there, and customers can opt for a traditional burial<br>

 there, but the new part will be free of all of the usual stone and bronze 
markers. It<br>
will look like-and will be-a nature preserve. A global 
positioning system will record<br>
the placement of each burial site. Visitors 
will be able to walk the grounds with Palm<br>
 Pilot-sized devices that will 
guide them to the grave and screen a video tribute, if<br>
one has been made.

<br> <b> Chemical Info </b><br>
<i>Folks, I know there's more to 
&quot;chemical&quot; than just synthetic fragrances and pesticides, but I ask 
that when you think chemical, think &quot;petrochemical in fragrances.&quot; 
You have a right to know what you are putting on your body and the bodies of 
your children. You are also putting fragrance chemicals into the air for all to 
breathe despite their underlying health concerns -- including pregnancy. AND, 
you are putting fragrance chemicals in the water, which are affecting our fish 
and wildlife, and other people downstream, as these chemicals are not washed 
out in wastewater management practices. If you don't wear synthetic scents in 
public venues, you and people around you can more fully enjoy the fragrances 
from Mother Nature, you may find your allergies less active, aromas of food and 
beverage will be heightened, and you won't have to worry about bioaccumulation 
of these rather superfluous toxic chemicals in your body, the bodies of your 
children, or the environment. You may well like &quot;YOUR fragrances,&quot; 
but YOU are worthy of safe products, and we who don't use synthetic scents are 
worthy of cleaner air. -- barb</i><br>

<b>&quot;The Science Behind This Month's 
Activities</b> <br>
 In 'The Nose Knows', children have an opportunity to think 
about how the sense of<br>
 smell really works. By placing perfume in a cup and 
smelling, children should get the<br>
 idea that something from the perfume 
must have gotten into the air. For the purposes<br>
of these children's 
activities, we call these molecules &quot;smell molecules&quot;. As a result of
<br> the activity, children should understand that the molecules need to get 
into the air<br>
and then into the nose in order to smell them. Children should 
be able to smell the<br>
 perfume through a napkin and possibly, even through 
plastic wrap. This will suggest<br>
that the smell molecules are very small.

<b><i>Chemical 
Awareness</i></b><br>
 &quot;Background information:<br>
<b><i>A European 
NGO-campaign on chemicals policy</i></b>
<p> By Allan Andersen, The Danish Society for the Conservation of Nature, <br>

 Christian Ege Joergensen, The Danish Ecological Council, and Poul Wendel 
Jessen,<br>
 The Danish Consumer Council.</p>
<p> &quot;The whole framework of directives, which make up EU chemicals 
policy, is now under<br>
 revision. It is crucial that environmental and 
consumer NGO&frac14;s become actively<br>
 involved in formulating the 
chemicals policy of the future. To strengthen NGO efforts,<br>
 we ask all 
NGO&frac14;s and other interested parties to support the Chemicals Campaign<br>

 outlined below.</p>
<p> &quot;During the most recent 50 years of industrial development, the 
production of chemicals<br>
 has increased 3-400 times on a global scale. Of 
the 10-15 million substances known<br>
 today, at least 100,000 chemical 
substances can be found individually as industrially<br>
 manufactured-marketed 
substances.</p>
<p> &quot;We give names to and know chemical formulas of practically all of 
these substances.<br>
 However, even though we have dramatically increased our 
knowledge of the biological<br>
 significance of chemical substances, we know 
very little - or often nothing at all - about<br>
 the biological effects of an 
overwhelming majority of the man-made chemicals. . . . &quot;<br>

 &quot;Several European NGOs have published 
their own policies or strategies on chemicals. A<br>
 few are mentioned below, 
and main conclusions or recommendations are cited. We<br>
 hope that this brief 
summary may inspire other NGOs in their work with chemicals issues. ...&quot;

<li><b>20,000 chemicals deemed dangerous </b><br>
 Issue # 11, October 23rd 
2000<br>
 &quot;By means of sophisticated computer technology the Danish 
Environmental Agency<br>
 has now identified adverse environmental effects or 
health hazards in 20,000 chemical<br>
 substances previously not known to be 
dangerous. Thus the Agency has brought to light<br>
 a major European problem. 
The industries are prepared to make useful the new<br>
 information.
<p> &quot;The threat to environment and health presented by chemicals is a lot 
more far-reaching<br>
 than previously assumed by European authorities. After 
many years of intensive<br>
 studies the Danish Environmental Agency is soon to 
publish a list of 20,000 chemical<br>
 substances with undesired effects on 
environment or health.</p>
<p> &quot;So far EU has only listed some 5,000 substances as dangerous.</p>
<p> &quot;The 20,000 substances now assessed by the DK Environmental Agency, 
using computer<br>
 modelling, were hardly known previously in terms of their 
harmful effects. . . . &quot;<br>

<li><b>SECRET CHEMICAL INDUSTRY DOCUMENTS POSTED ONLINE </b><br>
 WASHINGTON, 
DC, March 27, 2001 (ENS) - Fifty years of confidential chemical<br>
 company 
memos, letters, reports and meeting minutes reveal an industry that<br>

continues to mislead the public about toxic chemical hazards and exposures, an
<br> environmental research group said today. 
<p> The Environmental Working Group (EWG) launched a website - the 
&quot;Chemical<br>
Industry Archives&quot; at http://www.ewg.org - with an 
initial collection of more<br>
 than 35,000 pages of chemical industry insider 
documents.<br>

<li><b>Fragrance Materials Association </b><br>

with safe and wholesome fragrances and fragrance ingredients.&quot;
http://www.fmafragrance.org/
<p> </p> 
<ul> <i>Just what toxins and what combinations of toxins are they hiding 
behind that mendacious<br>
 claim? Perhaps the FMA has no dictionary in which 
to look up words like SAFE or WHOLESOME.
<p> Do any governing bodies give a tinker's damn about what the chemical 
fragrance industry states?<br>
 There seems to be little interest in warning 
the public of known health adverse events associated<br>
 with the use of 
fragrances. One does not even have to use scented products to suffer asthma<br>

 and other upper and lower respiratory ailments, migraines and other headaches, 
neurological<br>
 symptoms, etc. Information is available that clues one in to 
the fact that rising cancer rates may<br>
 be influeneced by the carcinogens 
commonly found in fragrances.</p>
<p> Where are the warnings from our government agencies that are charged with 
protecting public<br>
 health? Where are are state and federal legsilators for 
that matter, who could write and pass laws<br>
 for stricter labeling 
requirements? I can tell you, some legislators can stand for the count<br>

while others take a hike at the mere presence of industry pressure. And 
industry pressure there<br>
is a plenty, from the&gt;very arm that brags of the 
defeat of California legislation (Aug. 2004) and<br>
 claims its products and 
their ingredients are &quot;safe and wholesome.&quot;</p>
<p> Who is listening? No one can be too smug about not suffering from perfume 
poisoning. Your<br>
 time may yet come, and it can hit with a vengence. Are you 
ready?</p></i> 
<p><i> While you read &quot;safe and wholesome&quot; think about the fact that 
fragrances are found to contain<br>
 chemicals that are known carcinogens, 
hormone disrupters, irritants (poison to lungs and skin)<br>
 neurotoxins, 
sensitizers (lungs and skin) and teratogens (capable of adversely affecting 
developing<br>
 embryos and fetuses). Now, what's that about safe and wholesome 
products and ingredients? -- barb</i><br>

 The chemical industry would tell you, but then

 ANDREW WILKINS; Memphis Flyer; 4/5/2001 <br>
 
&quot;From plastics to cleaning products to medicine, nearly every aspect of 
modern life<br>
 has been touched by the 60-year-old chemical revolution. And 
according to a recent<br>
 Centers for Disease Control (CDC) study, every 
American has been contaminated by<br>
 some of these chemicals. ...&quot;<br>

<br> &quot;... <b>Few of the chemicals we assume to be safe are tested or 
regulated, due primarily<br>
to the lobbying efforts of the chemical industry 
through political contributions,<br>
 partisan science, and public relations.

<i>How, I ask you, do you get the industry

Chemical Sensitivity - It's a Serious Problem More Often Than You Think!!!</b> 
by Adrienne Buffaloe, MD<br>

http://www.accessnewage.com/articles/health/chemical.htm
<p> </p> 
<ul> 
<li> <b> Transcript of testimony of Dr. Adrienne Buffaloe on the effects of 
pesticides<br>
 on people, particularly malathion and pyrethroids based on her 
own evaluations of her<br>
 patients, before hearings held by a Congressional 
panel chaired by Congressional<br>
 representative Gerald Ackerman, of Queens 
NY.</b><br>
 &quot;... Malathion, the manufacturer's own sheets state what the 
health effects are.<br>
 There is a note on those data sheets to the doctors 
informing the doctors that<br>
<b>Pipanol and Malathion can cause respiratory, 
cardiac and neurological dysfunction,<br>
 including coma, muscle spasms, labor 
breathing, frothing of the mouth and nose,<br>
 nausea, vomiting, headache, and 
weakness.</b> [emphasis added] &quot;
<p> &quot;...Pyrethrins or Pyrethroids, ... <b>causes severe allergy attacks 
in sensitive people,<br>
 dermatitis, asthma, rhinitis, anaphylactic reactions, 
numbness of the lips and tongue,<br>
 sneezing, vomiting, diarrhea, ringing in 
the ears and restlessness; it can also cause<br>
 convulsions, which is 
seizures, incoordination, and death from respiratory paralysis.</b> <br>
 
&quot;To say that these pesticides are perfectly safe is an outrage. With 
Resmethrin or<br>
 Pyrethroid, it's particularly problematic, because the first 
death from a Pyrethroid<br>
 exposure was reported right here in New York City 
in 1994, just five years before<br>
 the spraying, by the current director of 
the New York City Poison Center. And that<br>
 article has been given to the 
legislators, and it is in your packet.<b>This death was as a <br>
 result of a 
very brief exposure to Pyrethroid.</b> ...&quot; [emphasis added]<br>

 ABSORPTION, DISTRIBUTION 
AND FATE<br>
 &quot;. . . Once a chemical is absorbed into the bloodstream, it 
can have several different<br>
 fates. In many cases, it is rapidly removed 
from the body through the urine or feces.<br>
In other situations, it may be 
stored in various parts of the body, such as fat or bone,<br>
and remain in the 
individual for many years. A compound may also lead to a toxic effect<br>
 
through interaction with certain organs or tissues in the individual or with 
other<br>
 compounds in the body. Often, a substance which is absorbed into the 
body interacts<br>
with particular body chemicals and is changed into one or 
more other chemicals. This<br>
 process is called metabolism and the products 
are called metabolites. Metabolism may<br>
lead to products which are easier 
for the body to excrete and so can protect the body<br>
from possible adverse 
effects. In other cases, however, the metabolites may be more<br>
toxic than 
the original chemical which was absorbed. The variety of products resulting<br>

 from metabolism may have the same possible fates as the original chemical -- 
storage,<br>
 excretion or toxicity. . . .&quot;<br>

 &quot;What is trichloroethylene? (Pronounced 
try-klor'oh eth'uh-leen)<br>
 &quot;Trichloroethylene (TCE) is a nonflammable, 
colorless liquid with a somewhat sweet<br>
 odor and a sweet, burning taste. It 
is used mainly as a solvent to remove grease from<br>
 metal parts, but it is 
also an ingredient in adhesives, paint removers, typewriter<br>
 correction 
fluids, and spot removers.<br>
http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/tfacts19.html
<p> </p></li> 
<li><b><i>California Hazard Evaluation System and Information Service (HESIS)
</i></b><br>
 &quot;TCE is sometimes called by other names, such as 
trichloroethene, ethylene trichloride,<br>
or ethinyl trichloride. It is sold 
under many different brand names, such as Tri-Clene,<br>
 Trielene, Trilene, 
Trichloran, Trichloren, Algylen, Trimar, Triline, Tri, Trethylene,<br>
 
Westrosol, Chlorylen, Gemalgene, and Germalgene.<br>
 &quot;TCE looks like 
water and has a sweet odor like chloroform. It is mainly used in metal<br>
 
degreasing. It is also used as a raw material to make other chemicals, as a 
cleaner in<br>
 electronics manufacturing, and for all sorts of general solvent 
purposes such as in paints,<br>
 paint strippers, and adhesives. It has also 
been used as a low-temperature refrigerant<br>
 and as a grain fumigant, and is 
still sometimes used in dry cleaning. It is no longer<br>
 commonly used as a 
medical anesthetic gas. ...&quot;<i>(Ain't that grand?!? -- barb)</i><br>

<i>It's only &quot;anecdotal,&quot; but 
damn, it is true! Several years ago, several people gathered for a<br>
 meeting 
with Berkeley's Commission on Disability. They met in a Senior Citizens Center. 
That<br>
 particular evening, one of the custodial crew, cleaned with a load of 
bleach. Several of us wound<br>
up with our lungs seared. Only one woman 
received any recompense from the city . . . to cover<br>
 her emergency room 
visit as I recall. None of my visits to alternative care were covered by the<br>
 city, nonetheless, I lived with very painful lungs for several weeks as a 
result. Maybe bleach<br>
 companies wish to assure us that their product is 
safe and its only the big guys like paper mills<br>
 that pollute, but let me 
assure you, bleach can cause adverse health effects in &quot;small&quot; 
quantities<br>
 too . . . and it certainly can be a severe pollutant of the 
indoor air environment. -- barb</i><br>

<li><b>Arsenic and CCA-Treated Wood</b><br>
 &quot;...<b>Burning:</b>
Incineration of CCA wood does not destroy arsenic. It is incredible, but<br>
 a 
single 12 foot 2 x 6 contains about 27 grams of Arsenic - enough arsenic to 
kill 250<br>
 adults. Burning CCA wood releases the chemical bond holding 
Arsenic in the wood,<br>
 and just one Tablespoon of ash from a CCA wood fire 
contains a lethal dose of<br>
 Arsenic. Worse yet, Arsenic gives no warning: it 
does not have a specific taste or odor to<br>
 warn you of its presence. No one 
disputes that the ash from burning CCA wood is<br>
 highly toxic: It is illegal 
to burn CCA wood in all 50 states. This has serious<br>
 implications for 
firefighters, cleanup and landfill operations. ...&quot;
<p> <b>&quot;Direct Contact:</b> In a study conducted by the Connecticut 
Agricultural Experiment<br>
 Station, the authors found that arsenic is 
released to the child's hand by direct contact<br>
 with arsenic-treated wood. 
The amount ingested per day was estimated to be about<br>
7 micrograms per day. 
This should be compared against an estimated 5 micrograms<br>
 estimated in 
food and 5 to 100 micrograms (ppb) in drinking water. ...&quot;<br>

<li><b>Disposal of CCA-Treated Wood</b><br>
<br>
<i>How does one dispose of 
poisoned wood?<br>
<br>
 I read: DO <b>NOT</b> BURN. DO <b>NOT</b> CHIP. DO <b>
NOT</b> USE AS MULCH. <br>
 I was wondering, What are we supposed to do? I know 
we are supposed to WEAR &quot;DUST&quot;<br>
 MASK and WEAR GLOVES when working 
with CCA-treated wood . We also learn that we<br>
 are to SEAL EXISTING 
structures with non slipery sealant and then reseal every two years.<br>
 We 
also learn that if we want to dispose of CCA-treated wood that the HOMEOWNER 
MUST<br>
 CONTACT PROPER local and state authorities. Bully! 
<p> A representative of the City of Berkeley's Toxics Management Division 
advises, &quot;Best thing to do<br>
 is call landfill operators and ask. Most 
will not take it. Some will. That has been our<br>
 experience for creosote 
treated wood as well.&quot;<br>
<br>
 But, then HOW do the 
&quot;disposers&quot; dispose of this poisoned wood safely? Of course, one 
always<br>
 hears about expense . . . In the case of CCA-treated wood, it's the 
expense of lined land fills.<br>
 I'd like to start hearing about the concern 
for the expense of a too-soon lost life. Or the expense of<br>
 chronic 
diseases that could have been avoided. The people are paying an unfathomable 
price.</p>
<p> Sooner or later we all will have the expense associated with trying to 
clean up yet another<br>
 poison foisted upon an unsuspecting public. It seems 
to me that the 1970s mark the<br>
 era of the chemical industry going wild with 
all sorts of products that could prove<br>
 there was better living through 
chemistry without concern to what would be the effects<br>
 20 years into the 
future for the people and our fellow creatures on this planet.<br>
 Whether the 
topic is CCA-treated wood, pesticides, fertilizers, or synthetic flavors<br>
 
and fragrances, phaarmaceuticals . . . or the more recent experiences with 
water-befouling<br>
 MTBE, we are now left trying to clean up our environment 
and our bodies.<br>
 Until I learn something better, I'd say <b>line those 
landfils</b> and protect those <br>
 workers with more than just a dust mask in 
hopes of avoiding to the extent possible the<br>
 impossible-to-put-a-figure-on 
expense to the health of the planet, and its creatures.</p></i>

 CCA-treated wood can be 
disposed of with regular municipal trash (i.e., municipal solid<br>
 waste, not 
yard waste). Homeowners should contact the appropriate state and local<br>
 
agencies for further guidance on the disposal of CCA-treated wood.&quot;<br>

<br>
 ARB Contract No. 01-336 (Full 
Report)</b><br>
 ABSTRACT<br>
 When cleaning products and air fresheners are 
used indoors, occupants are exposed to<br>
 airborne chemicals, potentially 
leading to health risks. Indoor air pollutant exposures<br>
 owing to cleaning 
product and air freshener use depend on emissions from products,<br>
 dynamic 
behavior of chemical species, and human factors. A series of experiments was<br>
 conducted to investigate volatile organic compound emissions, concentrations, 
and<br>
 reactive chemistry associated with the household use of cleaning 
products and air<br>
 fresheners. Research focused on two common classes of 
ingredients in cleaning products<br>
 and air fresheners: ethylene-based glycol 
ethers, which are classified as toxic air<br>
 contaminants, and terpenes, 
which react rapidly with ozone. A shelf-survey of retail<br>
 outlets led to 
the selection of 21 products whose chemical composition was characterized.<br>
 
Among the criteria used to select these products were ready availability through
<br> California retail outlets and, for the majority of products, expectation 
that they contained<br>
 ethylene-based glycol ethers, terpenes and related 
compounds, or both. Of the 17<br>
 cleaning products characterized, four 
contained substantial levels of d-limonene (4-25% by<br>
 mass), three 
contained terpenoids that are characteristic of pine oil, six contained<br>
 
substantial levels of ethylene-based glycol ethers (0.8-10% by mass), and five 
contained<br>
 less than 0.2% of any of the target analytes. Xylene in one 
product was the only other<br>
 toxic air contaminant detected. Among the four 
air fresheners characterized, three<br>
 contained substantial quantities 
(9-14% by mass) of terpene hydrocarbon and terpene<br>
 alcohol constituents, 
with linalool being the most abundant. Six of the 21 products were<br>
 
investigated in simulated-use experiments in which emissions and concentrations 
of<br>
 primary constituents were measured. Cleaning products that contain 2- 
butoxyethanol<br>
 as an active ingredient produced one-hour-average 
concentrations of 300 to 2,300 &micro;g/m 3<br>
 immediately after simulated 
typical use in a room-sized chamber. For cleaning products<br>
 that contain 
d-limonene as an active ingredient, corresponding levels were 1,000 to<br>
 
6,000 &micro;g/m 3 . Application of a pine-oil based cleaner produced 
one-hour-average<br>
 concentrations of 10-1300 &micro;g/m 3 for terpene 
hydrocarbons and terpene alcohols.<br>
 Reactive chemistry was studied by 
exposing constituents of three products to ozone, both<br>
 in a bench-scale 
chamber and during simulated use. Prominent products of the<br>
 reaction of 
terpenes with ozone included formaldehyde (a toxic air contaminant), hydroxyl
<br> radical, and secondary organic aerosol (a form of fine particulate 
matter). Incorporating<br>
 the new experimental data, exposures were estimated 
for several simulated use<br>
 scenarios. Under ordinary circumstances, 
exposures to 2-butoxyethanol, formaldehyde,<br>
 and secondary organic aerosol 
are not expected to be as high as guideline values solely<br>
 as a result of 
cleaning product or air freshener use. However, ordinary use could lead to<br>
 
exposure levels of similar magnitude as guideline values. Scenario model results
<br> suggest that exposure levels could exceed guideline values under 
exceptional yet plausible<br>
 conditions, such as cleaning a large surface 
area in a small room. The results of this<br>
 study provide important 
information for understanding the inhalation exposures to<br>
 certain air 
pollutants that can result from the use of common household products.<br>

<p> <b> Principal Investigator: William W. Nazaroff<br>
 University of 
California, Berkeley<br>
 April 2006 <br>
<br>
 ARB Contract No. 01-336 (Full 
Report)</b><br>
 ABSTRACT<br>
 When cleaning products and air fresheners are 
used indoors, occupants are exposed to<br>
 airborne chemicals, potentially 
leading to health risks. Indoor air pollutant exposures<br>
 owing to cleaning 
product and air freshener use depend on emissions from products,<br>
 dynamic 
behavior of chemical species, and human factors. A series of experiments was<br>
 conducted to investigate volatile organic compound emissions, concentrations, 
and<br>
 reactive chemistry associated with the household use of cleaning 
products and air<br>
 fresheners. Research focused on two common classes of 
ingredients in cleaning products<br>
 and air fresheners: ethylene-based glycol 
ethers, which are classified as toxic air<br>
 contaminants, and terpenes, 
which react rapidly with ozone. A shelf-survey of retail<br>
 outlets led to 
the selection of 21 products whose chemical composition was characterized.<br>
 
Among the criteria used to select these products were ready availability through
<br> California retail outlets and, for the majority of products, expectation 
that they contained<br>
 ethylene-based glycol ethers, terpenes and related 
compounds, or both. Of the 17<br>
 cleaning products characterized, four 
contained substantial levels of d-limonene (4-25% by<br>
 mass), three 
contained terpenoids that are characteristic of pine oil, six contained<br>
 
substantial levels of ethylene-based glycol ethers (0.8-10% by mass), and five 
contained<br>
 less than 0.2% of any of the target analytes. Xylene in one 
product was the only other<br>
 toxic air contaminant detected. Among the four 
air fresheners characterized, three<br>
 contained substantial quantities 
(9-14% by mass) of terpene hydrocarbon and terpene<br>
 alcohol constituents, 
with linalool being the most abundant. Six of the 21 products were<br>
 
investigated in simulated-use experiments in which emissions and concentrations 
of<br>
 primary constituents were measured. Cleaning products that contain 2- 
butoxyethanol<br>
 as an active ingredient produced one-hour-average 
concentrations of 300 to 2,300 &micro;g/m 3<br>
 immediately after simulated 
typical use in a room-sized chamber. For cleaning products<br>
 that contain 
d-limonene as an active ingredient, corresponding levels were 1,000 to<br>
 
6,000 &micro;g/m 3 . Application of a pine-oil based cleaner produced 
one-hour-average<br>
 concentrations of 10-1300 &micro;g/m 3 for terpene 
hydrocarbons and terpene alcohols.<br>
 Reactive chemistry was studied by 
exposing constituents of three products to ozone, both<br>
 in a bench-scale 
chamber and during simulated use. Prominent products of the<br>
 reaction of 
terpenes with ozone included formaldehyde (a toxic air contaminant), hydroxyl
<br> radical, and secondary organic aerosol (a form of fine particulate 
matter). Incorporating<br>
 the new experimental data, exposures were estimated 
for several simulated use<br>
 scenarios. Under ordinary circumstances, 
exposures to 2-butoxyethanol, formaldehyde,<br>
 and secondary organic aerosol 
are not expected to be as high as guideline values solely<br>
 as a result of 
cleaning product or air freshener use. However, ordinary use could lead to<br>
 
exposure levels of similar magnitude as guideline values. Scenario model results
<br> suggest that exposure levels could exceed guideline values under 
exceptional yet plausible<br>
 conditions, such as cleaning a large surface 
area in a small room. The results of this<br>
 study provide important 
information for understanding the inhalation exposures to<br>
 certain air 
pollutants that can result from the use of common household products.<br>

<p> <i>And, of course, the industry (below) must have its say . . . for what 
matters is selling products!<br>
 Regardless of the industry's claims of 
safety, fragrance products volatilize and adversely affect<br>
 the health of 
millions of people -- users and non users who are really sceondhand users.</i>
</p>
<p><i> There is NO consumer protection by any government agency. The 
&quot;authority&quot; is fragmented, at<br>
 best. The fragmentation exists 
because the Food and Drug Administration is only<br>
 known as the 
&quot;Authority Over Cosmetics&quot; -- but isn't THE authority because the 
industry<br>
 is self-regulated! The FDA is so much NOT an authority, it can't 
even demand its<br>
 required warning be affixed to labels of fragrances 
released to market without full<br>
 substantiation of safety. What a joke . . 
. and the industry laughs all the way to the bank!</i></p>
<p><i> The fact that the public isn't even clued in by the FDA led to EHN's 
FDA petition, 99P-1340,<br>
 which was filed with the FDA on May 11, 1999. The 
FDA's silence, I may say, has been deafening!</i></p>
<p><i> But to revisit my statement about &quot;fragmentation&quot; . . . IF 
fragrances or flavors are found<br>
 in fabric softeners or in bleaches or air 
&quot;fresheners&quot; or deodorizers, in various cleaners,<br>
 or in 
detergents for dishes or laundry or in pesticides, or in candles -- wherever, 
other<br>
 than for cosmetic purposes -- the FDA has no say in those 
fragrances. So, try to find an<br>
 agency that does. <br>
 I've had the 
personal frustration of turning to the EPA . . . they sent me back to the FDA
<br> who assured me they have nothing to do with fragrances except for those in 
cosmetics<br>
 or personal care products and used as colognes, perfumes, toilet 
water, aftershaves, in<br>
 body deodorants, lotions, soaps, shampoos, 
conditioners, and other hair care products, etc.<br>
<br>
 Failing with that 
government agency, I turned to the Consumer Products Safety<br>
 Commission. 
Admitedly, it's been a while since I last set myself up for that level of<br>
 
frustration, but there were years there that whenever I'd contact them to 
complain about<br>
 being poisoned by scented fabric softeners, laundry 
detergents, various cleaners, air<br>
 &quot;fresheners,&quot; etc., they 
hadn't had any complaints before mine. After the first several<br>
 comments 
like that, I got to saying, Wait A MINUTE! What about my previous<br>
 
complaints? To which I was told time and again, that they had had a database 
problem,<br>
or a computer malfunction or ... In other words, they kept no 
records so everytime<br>
 became a first time they heard anything about fabric 
softeners or what have you.<br>
 However, because I was part of a campaign to 
complain to the CPSC, I knew it to be false<br>
 statements. Eventually I did 
get a printout of a list of complaints, but whether they<br>
 have managed to 
maintain that database or not, I don't know.<br>
<br>
 During my entire ordeal 
with chemical injury, I begged our government agencies and also<br>
 nonprofits 
to begin keeping a log of times fragrances (or flavors) triggered<br>
 asthma 
or other upper or lower respiratory problems including sinus infections, lung
<br> infections and laryngitis, migraines or other neurological problems, acne 
and other skin<br>
 problems, etc. Just keep a list of diseases -- including 
the above, plus cancers and<br>
 reproductive problems and fetal development 
problems, SIDS, etc., -- where fragrances<br>
 had been in use. If the public 
isn't polled, we'll never know the full extent of the harm<br>
 these chemicals 
can do.<br>
<br>
 To my body, it matters not the source of the petrochemically 
derived fragrance (or<br>
 flavor), if it is man-made it is poison to my body. 
And I didn't get that way easily. It was<br>
 after many years of exposure in a 
highly scented workplace where I battled on behalf<br>
 of cleaner air for 
everyone. I eventually had to retire and that's when I turned my<br>
 efforts 
to helping people worldwide through my volunteer efforts for the Environmental
<br> Health Network.</i></p>
<p><i> The truth is, the flavors and fragrance industry is self-regulated and 
further protected by<br>
 trade-secret laws. Those laws do nothing to protect 
the industry from rip-off scents.<br>
 Obviously. But trade secret laws do a 
fine job of shielding the industry from an informed<br>
 consumership. <br>
<br>
 Once you become sensitized by arftificial fragrances, it is too late to save 
your health. The<br>
 time to protect your health is BEFORE you become 
chemically injured and the only<br>
 way you can even try to accomplish that 
now is to look at the labels. IF you see either<br>
 the word 
&quot;flavor&quot; or &quot;fragrance&quot; on the label, leave the product on 
the shelf. Look for<br>
 safer products that contain NO artificial flavors or 
fragrances. And, IF you work, or go<br>
 to school, or a healthcare center or a 
doctor's office and you encounter synthetically<br>
 scented products, begin 
educating them by directing them to the work of Prof.<br>
 Steinemann or to the 
document developed to help people with fragrance sensitivity issues.<br>

<i>I take 
exception to the claim on this page that,</i> &quot;...The small amount of 
fragrance found in these products has virtually no effect on the environment. 
... If you like em, use em, but your not saving the world by avoiding 
them.&quot;
<p> <i>Ahhhhh, but IF we look, we can find studies showing fragrance chemicals 
found in remote<br>
 rural areas (Norway), we can find studies showing that 
fragrance chemicals are found downstream<br>
 adversely affecting fish and 
wildlife (see EHN'sPOPs), we can find studies showing fragrance<br>
 chemicals 
stored in breast tissue, where it can flow downstream into the nursing infant. 
And we<br>
 don't have to go far to realize that our own neighborhoods are 
polluted by highly scented<br>
 detergents and fabric softeners used by others. 
IF WE LOOK, we can find information that will<br>
 make smart shoppers with a 
mind to our environment, seek safer, petrochemical-free products.<br>
 And if 
we stop to think for a minute we will realize that not a single person who uses 
scented<br>
 products uses or comes into contact with only that one product 
with its little bit of scent added<br>
 to it. Fragrances are highly volatile 
and the commonly used phthalates -- hormone disrupters --<br>
 are added to 
them to make their scent last. None of us -- not even the FDA -- knows enough
<br> about long-term and systemic effects of fragrance chemicals which enter 
our bodies through<br>
 absorption and inhalation.</i></p>
<p><i> I suggest erring on the side of caution. Until such time as we can be 
assured that fragrances are<br>
 safe for our developing fetuses, infants and 
children, our elderly and the already ill, Avoid fragrances. -- barb</i> <br>

 The 1990 Clean Air Act (CAA)<br>

<p> </p></li> 
<li><b>TESTIMONY OF THE <br>
 MICKEY LELAND NATIONAL URBAN AIR TOXICS RESEARCH 
CENTER<br>
 BEFORE THE CLEAN AIR, WETLANDS, PRIVATE PROPERTY AND NUCLEAR SAFETY
<br> SUBCOMMITTEE SENATE COMMITTEE ON ENVIRONMENT AND PUBLIC WORKS</b> <br>
 
&quot;Conclusion
<p> &quot;It is personal exposure to air pollutants, and not air concentration 
that is the critical<br>
 component in assessing the public health impacts from 
air pollutants. Science has now<br>
 established that indoor air pollutants can 
be a major contributor to a person's overall<br>
 exposure to air pollutants. 
In addition, the findings from these studies indicate that the<br>
 same air 
pollutants subject to regulation under the Clean Air Act are often found at<br>

much higher levels indoors. The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 rely solely on 
the<br>
 assumption that outdoor levels are determinative of an individual's 
exposure and hence<br>
 risk. The Act does not address the contribution of 
indoor sources of air pollution or<br>
the differences between indoor and 
outdoor quality.<br>
<br>
 &quot;Absent information about personal exposures, 
the real public health risk of air toxics<br>
 cannot be accurately assessed. 
Merely reducing the ambient emission levels may not<br>
result in improved 
public health. By focusing on exposure, we can determine where the<br>
 
greatest risk to public health lie and tailor the solution to correct the 
problem. The<br>
 Leland Center will continue to focus our research on 
addressing the critical area of<br>
 exposure, thus allowing for a more 
cost-effective approach to protecting public health<br>
 under the Clean Air 
Act. &quot;<br>

 &quot;Another relevant term is 'teratogen'. 
According to 'American Heritage', a 'teratogen'<br>
 is any agent, such as a 
virus, a drug, or radiation, that adversely affects and causes<br>
 
malformation of a developing embryo or fetus. Chemicals can cross not only our
<br>blood-brain barriers but also blood-placental barriers.Many pesticides fall 
into this<br>
 category...and so do chemical ingredients used to concoct 
synthetic scents in our personal<br>
 care and conventional cleaning products. 
For example, take &quot;Fetal Coumarin<br>
 Syndrome&quot;. Women during 
pregnancy are told NOT to use coumarin as an anticoagulant.<br>
 However, 
coumarin is a common fragrance ingredient and moves swiftly into the<br>
 body. 
&quot;Teratogens&quot; can cause serious birth defects. &quot;<br>

Brian Robinson, Chairman<br>
 Environment Protection Authority, Victoria, 
Australia<br>
 &quot;... Waste production can in fact be viewed as a sign of 
inefficiency and lost profit. ...&quot;.<br>
 &quot;... Ford replaced an 
existing hot caustic paint stripping process used for cleaning car<br>
skids 
with a high pressure water jet system. The project resulted in annual savings of
<br> $300,000 from reduced chemical, energy and waste disposal costs. 
Significant<br>
 improvements in paint quality were also achieved through the 
ability to clean the<br>
skids on a more regular basis than had previously been 
possible. This cleaner production<br>
 success gave Ford the incentive to look 
for other opportunities to improve its<br>
 environmental performance and 
reduce costs. ...&quot;<br>

<li> <b>Cleaner Air </b><br>
<i><b>Cleaner Air Starts With Environmentally 
Sound Procurement</b><br>
 Look for low-emitting-VOC, truly fragrance-free or 
unscented, less hazardous products.<br>
 The reason I qualify 
&quot;fragrance-free&quot; and &quot;unscented&quot; is that the US Food and 
Drug<br>
 Administration allows the industry to claim a product is unscented or 
fragrance-free, which<br>
 nonetheless contain synthetic fragrances, used to 
mask other objectionable odors. We are<br>
 admonished to read labels that 
don't mean anything but more confusion!<br>
<br>
 However, the Department of 
the Interior spells it out for us: GREEN MUST NOT CONTAIN PETROCHEMICAL DERIVED 
FRAGRANCE. There is a reason for that, and that is spelled out on the first 
line: While you are thinking cleaner and greener, also thinkfragrance-free 
personal care products<br>
 to use and wear. To learn of some of the chemicals 
from which modern synthetic scents<br>
 are made, visit the FDA Citizens'

<p> <i>Two bits' worth from barb: Remember, the EPA tells us that indoor air 
pollution is<br>
 worse than outdoor air pollution AND we spend far more time 
indoors. Seems to me<br>
 it is not a huge leap in logic to figure out that the 
volatile organic compounds in synthetic<br>
 fragrances in personal care and 
household and janitorial cleaning/maintenance<br>
 products can play a 
significant role in indoor air pollution. See EPA's<br>
<b>Why Should You Be 
Concerned About the Quality of the Air That You Breathe?</b><br>

http://www.epa.gov/iedweb00/index.html</i></p>
<p><i> Another point from the EPA: &quot;Studies have found that levels of 
several organics average<br>
 2 to 5 times higher indoors than outdoors. During 
and for several hours immediately<br>
 after certain activities, such as paint 
stripping, levels may be 1,000 times background<br>
 outdoor levels.&quot;</i>

 By Dr. James Coleman; appearing in 
<b><i>Hearts with Soul</i></b><br>
 &quot;...Many credible studies, including 
those by the National Cancer Institute, have well<br>
 documented that a strong 
correlation exists between an increase in the incidence of<br>
 breast cancers 
and the use of mammograms. Unquestionably, the radiation used in<br>
 
mammograms is a known human carcinogens. The mainstream medical community<br>

tries to minimize the danger of mammograms with the overused trite phrase of 
&quot;risk vs.<br>
 benefit.&quot; The plain truth is that the risk is well 
documented while there is absolutely<br>
no medical proof of any benefit.

<p> <i>I have never had a mammogram and began refusing them in my 30s, when 
they were a routine<br>
 part of Kaiser's Multiphasic. It took backbone to say 
&quot;No&quot; to doctors who tried to convince me<br>
 that I was oh so very 
wrong. I hope to live long enough to be vindicated on this stand, just<br>
 as 
I've been vindicated on my stand against HRT. For more information see EHN's

 By the way, my expressed feelings do not

<i>You may not think of this as a 
consumer product, but it is commonly used in fragrances,<br>
 as rat poison and 
as an anticoagulant drug. Also, beware of Fetal Coumarin Syndrome, which so far,
<br> I've only found linked to the use of Coumarin as an anticoagulant. I'd 
like to see research on<br>
 it when used in perfume and perfumed products. -- 
barb</i><br>
 See Coumarin, below. <br>
<br>
<b>Musks</b><br>
 Synthetic musks 
are commonly used as fragrance ingredients, whether the fragrance is advertised 
as a musk-type scent or not. Musks
<p> <b>Phthalates</b><br>
<i>Phthalates are commonly added to fragrances. 
Indeed, we found phthalates added to the<br>
fragrance analyzed and serving as 
the basis of FDA Petition 99P-1340. Also, you should know --<br>
 YOU have 
every right to know! -- that in doing the research for</i> Not Too Pretty <i> 
every<br>
 fragrance was found to have phthalates, but other cosmetics tested 
had some products<br>
 free of phthalates. But I hasten to add a caution when 
it comes to our modern fragrances,<br>
 concocted from petrochemicals: 
Synthetic scents also contain chemicals that are known or<br>
suspected 
carcinogens, hormone disrupters, irritants, nerutotoxins, sensitizers and 
teratogens.<br>
 Getting rid of phthalates (shown in animal studies to affect 
male fetal development and also<br>
 adult male sperm production) may be a step 
toward safer products, but that is not THE answer<br>
. . . in my humble 
opinion. -- barb</i><br>

 Indoor air quality can be impacted by some

<br>
 
Products can release chemicals into the air during use, as the product dries or

<li><b>Some Crib Mattresses Toxic</b> Adapted from the &quot;Care2 Ask 
Annie&quot; newsletter.<br>
 &quot; ... Organic cotton mattresses. Organic 
cotton mattresses are much preferable to<br>
 nonorganic because of the heavy 
pesticide use in the cotton industry. By federal law,<br>
 cotton used in 
mattresses must be treated with a fire retardant. In most cases this is<br>
 
boric acid, which does not release vapors and is considered nontoxic. Note that
<br> organic cotton can have a strong smell that some find distasteful. ...

<ul> <b>Free and Clear Products</b> <br>
 &quot; ... Many conventional 
products call their products 'Free,' but<br>
 mask the smell of their 
surfactants (detergents) with added<br>
 fragrances. Seventh Generation 
products are truly free and<br>
 clear of added fragrances and we confirm our 
products are<br>
 hypo-allergenic through independent testing. ...&quot; <br>

<i>NOTE: Mainstream consumer products are often labeled &quot;UNscented&quot; 
or Fragrance-FREE,<br>
 which is totally bogus, but allowable under the FDA. 
The fragrance industry IS self regulated.<br>
 They focus of their 
&quot;thorough&quot; testing is for skin effects of only the primary user. They 
have yet<br>
to begun serious testing for adverse effects for folks other than 
primary user's skin . . . and<br>
 they've not a clue as to long-term effects, 
systemic effects, or what happens to one's respiratory<br>
 system or brain 
when assaulted by these toxic chemical concoctions. The chemicals go into the 
air<br>
 to impact the health of untold others, but they also go into YOUR body 
and the bodies of your<br>
 children . . . even those at the embryonic or fetal 
stage of development. Buyer beware. Fragrances<br>
 contain carcinogens, 
neurotoxins, teratogens, hormone disrupters, irritants and sensitizers. -- barb

tried even a little makeup, my face would become an acne bloom. Later in<br>
 
life, I developed my acne bloom, just from working with folks who chose to wear 
perfume. The<br>

 One last 
thought, when you think cosmetics, think fragranes. When you think fragrance, 
think toxins. When you think toxins, think poison. When you think poison, think 
of this definition by American Heritage Dictionary: &quot;1. A substance that 
causes injury, illness, or death, especially by chemical means.&quot; The 
industry may wish you to believe that our modern fragrances are safe and 
wholesome, but that is not the case. The for they are used not only as a scent 
in and of themselves, but also to mask objectionable odors in products. When 
fragrances are used as masks, the product is allowed to be misleadingly labeled 
&quot;unscented&quot; or &quot;fragrance-free&quot;. -- barb</i><br>

<li><b>Cosmetic Ingredients: Understanding the Puffery</b><br>
 FDA; by Judith 
E. Foulke; May 1992<br>
<i>Comments by barb in Italics.</i><br>
<i>Excerpted:
</i> &quot; ... The argument is sometimes made that while Congress intended to
<br> safeguard the health and economic interests of consumers with the Federal 
Food, Drug,<br>
 and Cosmetic Act, it also meant to protect a manufacturer's 
right to market a product<br>
 free of excessive government regulation. And, in 
an industry that sells personal image,<br>
 especially images of beauty and sex 
appeal, not allowing the puffery claims<br>
 would certainly hurt the 
marketing, says Bailey. ...<i> [Maybe that was OK in the days when fragrances 
were made mainly with esences from plants and animals, but I believe that time 
has shown that the manufacturers have not shown enough responsibility for 
marketing products substantiated for safety . . . beyond, perhaps, 
dermatological effects to the primary user. Where is the concern for 
dermatological effects to the nonuser, posed by the volatilizing chemicals from 
fragrances used by others? And, bigger questions are: Where are the studies for 
effects upon absorption, upon inhalation, for long-term effects, for systemic 
effects, for effects upon brain and nervous systems, for effects upon 
developing embryos and fetuses . . . and our infants, children and our 
elderly??????]</i> 
<p> &quot;... Still, with the exception of colors and certain prohibited 
ingredients,<b>a cosmetic manufacturer may use essentially any raw material in 
a product and market it without prior FDA approval.</b> The prohibited 
ingredients are biothionol, hexachlorophene, mercury compounds (except as 
preservatives in eye cosmetics), vinyl chloride and zirconium salts in aerosol 
products, halogenated salicylanilides, chloroform, and methylene chloride.<i>
[Emphasis added.]</i></p>
<p> &quot;Federal regulations require ingredients to be listed on product 
labels in descending order by quantity, but often the list is not 
user-friendly. Because cosmetic ingredients are often complex chemical 
substances, the list may be incomprehensible to the product's average user. (See
&quot;Cosmetic Safety: More Complex Than at First Blush&quot; in the November 
1991 FDA Consumer.) However, if the same name is used by all manufacturers, 
consumers can compare different products and make reasonable value judgments. 
...<i> [Remember, fragrance ingredients are protected by trade secret laws. 
Therefore, you will not learn of the chemicals used in the manufacture of a 
fragrance, regardless if that scent is in perfume or any other scented products 
you buy.]</i> http://www.fda.gov/fdac/reprints/puffery.html</p>
<p> </p></li> 
<li><b>Cosmetic Safety: More Complex Than at First Blush</b><br>
 by Dori 
Stehlin; FDA; November 1991; revised May 1995<br>
 &quot;... According to a 
study of cosmetic reactions conducted by the North American Contact Dermatitis 
Group, preservatives are the second most common cause of allergic and irritant 
reactions to cosmetics.<b>Fragrances are number one</b>. Although the study is 
more than 10 years old, the results can still be considered valid today, says 
Harold R. Minus, M.D., an associate professor of dermatology at Howard 
University Hospital. (For more information on this study, see &quot;Cosmetic 
Allergies&quot; in the November 1986 FDA Consumer.)<i> [<b>Fragrances are the 
number one cause of allergic and irritant reactions to cosmetics</b> . . . and 
that is not even taking into account the affects upon the respiratory systems 
and brains of users and non-users who are forced into being &quot;secondhand 
users.&quot;]</i><br>

 &quot;Several rumors concerning 
personal care products or ingredients used in<br>

 these false and 
unsubstantiated rumors. &quot;<br>
<i>Remember, CTFA is in the business of

adverse health effects, note who is making the statement, look at<br>
their 
background information . . . and then judge for yourself. And remember it is

 err on the side of caution. -- barb</i><br>

http://www.ctfa.org/viewpage.cfm?id=1076
<p> </p></li> 
<li><b>How Cosmetics Are Regulated</b><br>
 &quot;The Food, Drug, and Cosmetic 
Act requires that cosmetics and their<br>
 individual ingredients must be safe 
and that labeling must be truthful and not<br>
 misleading. The Food and Drug 
Administration&frac14;s (FDA) legal authority over<br>
 cosmetics is comparable 
with its authority over other FDA-regulated<br>
 products, such as foods, 
nonprescription drugs, and nonprescription medical<br>
 devices. FDA can take 
immediate action to stop the sale of any product that<br>
 does not meet these 
standards.<br>
<br>
 Cosmetic ingredients are reviewed by the Cosmetic 
Ingredient Review (CIR),<br>
 an independent, non profit scientific body that 
holds open public meetings<br>
 and publishes its findings in a peer reviewed 
journal. Its seven voting medical<br>
 and scientific members must meet the 
same conflict of interest standards as<br>
 persons serving on the FDA&frac14;s 
outside advisory committees. FDA, the<br>
 Consumer Federation of America, and 
industry serve as liaison members on<br>
 the CIR Expert Panel.<br>
<br>
 
Consumers can have confidence in their cosmetics given their oversight by<br>
 
FDA and long history of safe use.<br>

 example, cough and cold medicines. There is no danger of 
consumers overdosing<br>
 themselves with sunscreens. In fact, many consumers

 safety problems.<br>

cosmetic products. ...&quot;<br>

<li><b> CTFA WINS AGREEMENT ON NATIONAL UNIFORM LABELING</b> - September 10, 
1997<br>
<i>I, too, believe their should be uniform labeling . . . labeling 
that properly informs the consumers! And fragrances released to market without 
adequate testing for effects upon inhalation are not adequately tested. 
Afterall, fragrances and products with them, are made to be smelled . . 
.inhaled! The industry and the FDA should know the effects of these 
petrochemical brews on the primary user, as well as those subjected to 
secondary and tertiary levels of inhalation exposure. In addition, if 
fragrances are not tested for neurotoxic effects, or carcinogenic or 
teratogenic effects, they are not adequately tested.
<p> Heavens, the most testing done has been for skin reactions of the primary 
user. What about eczema, acne, rashes, burning and itchiness, hives, the 
feeling of millions of hot needles being applied, etc. . . . suffered at 
secondary and tertiary levels of exposure, not just primary level? As it 
stands, those exposed and suffering adverse events at the second- and 
third-hand levels of exposure are ignored, as have been primary users who have 
complained to the industry and the FDA -- we get assurances that are 
industry-biased.</p></i>
<p><i> To my mind, fragrances are released to market without adequate testing 
and therefore should carry the FDA mandated warning message:<b> 
&quot;WARNING:The safety of this product has not been determined.&quot;</b><br>

 All inadequately tested products, not carrying that warning should be declared 
&quot;misbranded&quot;<br>
 by the FDA. How complicated is that? If you read 
Authority Over Cosmetics, you'll likely get the idea that there's more the FDA 
cannot do than what they can do regarding the self-regulated fragrance industry.
<b>But the FDA can require the warning.</b> -- barb</i></p>

<br><br>
 &quot;CTFA has played a crucial role with government. It has led the 
industry forward with<br>

<i>EHN and I do

products that are safer for you.<br>
 One more word of caution, if it lists 
&quot;fragrance&quot; on the label, you may want to bet it's from the<br>

 &quot;... [B]ut as the law 
currently stands, the restrictions only apply when the chemicals are<br>
 used 
for specific purposes and so manufacturers are free to use as much as they want
<br> when using them for other purposes. (For example, triclosan must not 
exceed 0.3 percent<br>
 of the finished product when used as a preservative but 
it can exceed this limit when used<br>
 to prevent the growth of microbes on 
your body as it is used in a number of deodorants.)<br>
 Furthermore, the

cosmetics for no reason but as an unintended part of the manufacturing process.

 PRODUCTS 
POSE AVOIDABLE RISKS OF CANCER WARNS SAMUEL EPSTEIN, M.D.</b> <br>
 
&quot;CHICAGO, 01/15/01/PRNewswire/ - - The following was released by Samuel S. 
Epstein, M.D., Chairman of the Cancer Prevention Coalition and emeritus 
Professor of Environmental Medicine, University of Illinois School of Public 
Health, Chicago
<p> &quot;Government scientists recently identified a group of toxic chemicals 
known as<br>
 phthalates in urine of adults, with highest levels in 
premenopausal women, resulting<br>
 from inhalation and skin exposure to 
volatile parent ingredients used extensively as<br>
 solvents and plasticizers 
in personal care and cosmetic (PCC) products. These include<br>
 perfumes, 
shampoos, hair sprays and nail polishes. These findings raise major concerns<br>
in view of documented evidence, dating back to 1985, that these phthalates 
induce<br>
 birth defects, low sperm counts, and other reproductive toxicity in 
experimental animals.<br>
 The Food and Drug Administration (FDA), authorized 
by the 1938 Food, Drug and<br>
 Cosmetics Act to ban unsafe PCC products, 
responded that it will now 'consider' this<br>
 longstanding information. While 
obviously important, the phthalate findings merely<br>
 reflect the tip of an 
iceberg of more fundamental problems which have received minimal,<br>
 if any, 
attention, from Congress, the media and the public.<br>

<p> <b>More on Mammograms </b><br>
 &quot;Thursday, March 7, 2002, Letters to 
the Editor, The Washington Post, Page A20<br>
 &quot; In regard to the Feb. 22 
front-page article about mammograms:<br>
 First, a mammogram does not prevent 
cancer; it can only find an existing cancer.<br>
<br>
 &quot;Second, safer 
methods of diagnosis (without X-rays) are available, including thorough<br>
 
physical examinations, ultrasound, MRI and thermography. The last takes a heat 
picture<br>
 showing the physiological function breast tissue. Thermography is 
available in<br>
 France, Australia and some centers in the United States. 
Given that every mammogram,<br>
 indeed every X-ray procedure, carries an 
increased risk of causing cancer,<br>
 development of this safe, non-radiation 
technique should be a priority. ...&quot;<br>

 Coumarin is an anticoagulant, a raticide, and a common chemical used

<i>Use YOUR computer's &quot;find&quot; command 
to search for Coumarin.</i> <br>
 &quot; ... There is a HIGH level of concern 
over the extent of exposure to coumarin. In<br>
 addition to being widely used 
in perfumes, soap, other related household products,<br>
 coumarin is also used 
as an odor-masking agent that may be found in paints,<br>
 insecticides, and 
plastics (NTP, 1993). In 1990, NIOSH (NTP, 1993) estimated that<br>
 
approximately 240,000 workers are potentially exposed. The annual production of
<br> coumarin in the US is reported to be over 1 million lbs/yr (TSCA, 1990). 
...&quot;<br>
<i>Now, what I'd like to know is: Where are the studies on 
pregnant women who use perfume<br>
 and fragrances in other personal care 
products, as well as in household cleaning and maintenance<br>
 products and/or 
who work in jobs where fragrances are KING???? One does not have to<br>
 
personally use fragrances to be adversely affected by them. But for the 
pregnant woman who uses<br>
 them, I should think there would be concern for 
Coumarin is quickly absorbed into the body.<br>
 This study looks at the 
carcinogenic effects of Coumarin. I say we should also look at the effects<br>
 
of common, but unwitting use of Coumarin as a fragrance ingredient and its 
subsequent<br>
 potential for harming developing embryos and fetuses . . . 
babies! -- barb</i><br>

&quot;Another relevant term is 'teratogen'. According to 'American Heritage', a 
'teratogen'<br>
 is any agent, such as a virus, a drug, or radiation, that 
adversely affects and causes<br>
 malformation of a developing embryo or fetus. 
Chemicals can cross not only our<br>
blood-brain barriers but also 
blood-placental barriers.Many pesticides fall into this<br>
 category...and so 
do chemical ingredients used to concoct synthetic scents in our personal<br>
 
care and conventional cleaning products. For example, take &quot;Fetal Coumarin
<br> Syndrome&quot;. Women during pregnancy are told NOT to use coumarin as an 
anticoagulant.<br>
 However, coumarin is a common fragrance ingredient and 
moves swiftly into the<br>
 body. &quot;Teratogens&quot; can cause serious 
birth defects. &quot;<br>

Once they got the &quot;fragrance containing coumarin&quot; out! What do 
fragrances containing<br>
 coumarins do to developing fetuses? I've not found a 
hint that that has been studied. How,<br>
 can the medical industry so quickly 
hop on the UNEXPLAINED bandwagon whenever asked<br>
 about the sharp rise in 
rates of various chronic diseases and fetal development problems? They are<br>
 
quick with their UNEXPLAINED, which saves them looking at the role that may be 
played by<br>
 the proliferation of perfumed products during the past thirty 
years! It is past time for the<br>
 buying public to take care of their health 
by purchasing safer products. Remember, fragrances have<br>
 not be 
substantiated for safety before purchasing. The industry's primary concern has 
been for the<br>
 skin reactions of the primary user. They've not given a hang 
about others who get sick breathing<br>
 the volatilizing toxins. Heck, they 
haven't even been much concerned about the users breathing<br>
 and absorbing 
into their bodies, the toxins which are found via analysis. Buyer BEWARE! --

<br> ------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br> <b>Fetal coumarin syndrome </b><br>
Guillermo Font, MD, &amp; Mariana 
Solari, MD<br>
<b>Definition:</b> Fetal anomalies resulting from exposure to 
coumarin (anticoagulant) during pregnancy.<br>
<b>Synonyms:</b> Fetal warfarin 
syndrome, fetal coumarin embryopathy.<br>
<b>Incidence: </b>Exposure to 
coumarin in the 1 ST trimester carries a 25-30 % incidence of fetal warfarin 
syndrome [1]<br>
<b>Etiology: </b>Exposure to coumarin[2].<br>
<b>Recurrence 
risk:</b>Recurrence is possible if there is repeated exposure to coumarin <br>

<b>Diagnosis: </b>Facial anomalies (nasal hypoplasia, cleft lip and palate), 
hypoplasia of extremeties<br>
 (rhizomelic dwarfism, short fingers and 
dystrophic nails), scoliosis, CNS malformations (agenesis of<br>
 corpus 
callosum, Dandy-Walker malformation, hydrocephalus, cephalocele), heart defects
<br> and IUGR. [3], [4]<br>
<b>Pathogenesis: </b>Hemorrhage, subsequent 
scarring and interference with vitamin K dependant<br>
 proteins responsible 
for bone and other organ formation<br>
<b>Associated anomalies: </b>The same 
found under diagnosis<br>
<b>Differential diagnosis: </b>Exclusion of 
chromosomal abnormalities, or structural anomalies not<br>
 associated with 
coumarin exposure<br>
<b>Prognosis: </b>Dependant on the severity of the fetal 
malformation involved. Overall survival and<br>
 handicaps depend on the 
severity of the malformation.<br>
<b>Management:</b> Patients requiring long 
term coagulation, should substitute heparin for coumarin<br>
from the time 
pregnancy is diagnosed. [5], [6], [7]<br>
 Patients with&Yacute; known exposure 
to coumarin should have a targeted ultrasound evaluation.<br>

 The metabolism, toxicity and results of tests for

 natural product which exhibits marked species

 and toxicity. The majority of tests for

 suggest that coumarin is not a genotoxic 
agent. ...<br>

 &quot;A gas 
chromatographic (GC) method is described for the determination of coumarin<br>
 
in fragrance products. Coumarin was tentatively identified by retention time and
<br> confirmed by GC/mass spectrometry. The amount of coumarin was determined by
<br> external standard. The method was validated by conducting recovery studies 
from<br>
 fortified fragrance products at several concentrations. Recoveries of 
coumarin ranged<br>
 from 99 to 110%, with a relative standard deviation of 
3.24. The method was used to<br>
 survey a variety of fragrance products 
purchased in the metropolitan Washington, DC<br>
 area, for coumarin. Seventy 
one percent of the products were found to contain coumarin<br>
 at 
concentrations ranging from 0.002 to 0.61%.&quot;<br>

&quot;Coumarin is widely used as a fragrance in cosmetics, perfumes and soaps. 
The food and<br>
 Drug Administration banned coumarin use in food because of 
reports that coumarin<br>
 produced hepatotoxicity in rodents. Concerns about 
coumarin's safety have also been<br>
 raised by toxicity testing conducted by 
the National Toxicology Program. Therefore, we<br>
 initiated studies to 
measure the extent of coumarin absorption and metabolism in skin. ...<br>
 
These studies indicate that coumarin absorption is significant in skin. 
Systemic coumarin<br>
 absorption must be expected after dermal contact with 
coumarin-containing products.<br>

 &quot; The aim of this study was to identify the chemicals responsible for the

 a 44-year-old woman to her own perfume, but showing 
negative patch test results to<br>
the fragrance mix. For this purpose, the 
perfume concentrate from the eau de toilette<br>
was chemically fractionated. 
Each fraction obtained was afterwards tested on the patient<br>
 using a ROAT 
and/or a patch test. Only 1 fraction gave a positive ROAT result. This<br>
 
fraction was analyzed and found to contain coumarin and ethyl vanillin. 
Coumarin,<br>
 one of the most widely used fragrance compounds that is not 
present in the<br>
 fragrance mix, was confirmed as being the sensitizer.&quot;

<i>We are still 
talking coumarin, folks. What about coumarin in scented products for dogs AND 
people. Coumarin quickly enters the body. Let's do some research on fragrances! 
-- barb</i><br>
 &quot;Abstract<br>
 &quot;Eight out of a litter of 13 puppies 
were either born dead or died within 48 hours of birth. Three puppies that died 
shortly after birth were necropsied. Two puppies had hemorrhage in the thoracic 
and peritoneal cavities, intestinal serosa, and meninges. The third puppy was 
smaller than the other two puppies but did not have detectable hemorrhage. 
Brodifacoum, a second-generation coumarin anticoagulant, was detected in livers 
from the two puppies with hemorrhage. The dam did not have clinical signs of 
coagulopathy before or subsequent to whelping. The owners were confident that 
the dog had not been exposed to rodenticide for at least 4 weeks before 
whelping. A presumptive diagnosis of in utero brodifacoum toxicity was made. To 
the authors' knowledge this is the first time a second-generation coumarin 
anticoagulant has been detected in the liver of a newborn animal. This case is 
also unique because the dam was unaffected, suggesting that fetuses are more 
susceptible to brodifacoum toxicity than adult animals.
